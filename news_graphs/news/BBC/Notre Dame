im going to go there in assassins creed unity and pay my respects
this will go down in history wow..
What’s sad is how many wars it has been through yet it gets burned by (probably)  construction......
I hate seeing great history destroyed...


Did the real life movie happen?!
And the French will cover everything with perfume of silence
NO ONE DIED! that's the important thing, everything else is replaceable! I'm an Iraqi and in the past 200 years, thousands of historical (3000+ yr olds) artefacts have either been stolen by the super powers or destroyed by local idiots (ISIS). After a building burned with a few hours half a billion was raised but when thousands are killed barely anything is raised.
There's a complete media blackout in the Uk at the moment about the real situation of 
France and the Yellow Vest movement . Censorship is very fierce, even some journalists 
have been sent to jail .  Please  have a look at "Gilets Jaunes Paris acte 23"  footages , 
and please share some vids around .  
Many thanks , god bless !!    Greetings from France
WWI: doesn’t destroy Norte dame

WW2: doesn’t destroy Norte dame

Memers: destroys Norte dame
I'm not religious whatsoever, but this is very very sad.
This is a lesson for future.
Nobody cares about giving money for restoration before disaster.
It was such a beautiful church
Please don’t let the secularists led by Macron near this priceless , holy house of God! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
This the real life ending of The Hunchback of Notre Dame movie; Frollo burned it all down
Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame

The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes

To the bells of Notre Dame

To the big bells as loud as the thunder

To the little bells soft as a psalm

And some say the soul of the city is

The toll of the bells

The bells of Notre Dame
Let’s just hope this is a small part of the landmarks legacy and the building will make full recovery🙏
Quickest fire investigation in history.
BBC discovered the cause while it was still burning. Amazing work.
3D mapping of the Notre Dame in Assassin’s Creed may be used to help rebuild the cathedral.

Gamers Rise.
We all know it can be fixed, but it will never be the same ;(
I’m sure this has nothing to do with the other churches in France that were vandalized.....
who made this fire?






nice job
Wars couldn’t destroy it.

Yet some stupid dude in a hard hat can burn it to pieces
How can you mess up so badly that a 850 year old building is in flames?
BOLLOCKS it was set on fire
The Fire of the Notre Dame Cathedral is symbolic as the destruction of the WTC in N.Y.,but fortunately without human sacrifices...
This was soooooo planed by the govt , coz tf they would have found out who had done it by now
This is depressing to me a beautiful building structure that we lost, our ancestors will be disappointed to us for this to happen such beautiful building structure 😔
Oh so this is what ninja did when he was in Europe
Guess frollo did actually burn notre dame
Devastating lost for the world.!
It's a real tragedy that the building that more or less watched over a country for decades has suffered such damage. On the bright side, the structure itself 
was mostly intact, thanks to the collective efforts of all those who put out the fires. I hope the reconstruction goes well, and that I may someday
visit Paris to see Notre Dame in it's restored glory.
Finally a church became the light in the dark!
RIP beautiful piece of history, art and architecture! The whole cultural world is mourning, not only Paris! :((((
who else re-watched The Hunchback of Notre Dame after the news of the Cathedral burning down.
A building with that amount of history and importance should have had someone on watch 24/7. Fires during construction or renovations are very common. It's possible the Elite did this to stop the Yellow vest movement! Your attempt did not work the Yellow vest are still active! Keep up the struggle!
If only they had not 'renovated' the cathedral, nothing would have happened.
Amazing architecture and a shame it's damaged for that reason. Nothing lasts forever though.
The new earth and times for new beginnings
Tell us about all the other attacks on churches.
Got to make sure ALL candles are fully snuffed.
Is this is all you can conjour Saruman ??
Wait did richter use holy fire
But gosh, our esteemed CinC made such a breathtaking and helpful observation for the French, huh?  <smh>
Quasimodo's mixtape was fire 🔥🔥🔥
Buildings became vital not lives anymore Sad world.
I smell an inside job
The Devil is a great liar. The greatest liar on Earth.
I express deep sorrow for the loss of ancestral church.
Destruction by nature or by any other cause is easy than construction .
The fire bird strikes again!!!!
People will read this in books now. Thats crazy
This seriously broke my heart. Not because I'm a catholic, nor am I French... but because this was a Staple of Western Architecture and history... I feel so sore thinking of this. :(
hope they rebuild with steel for the new roof, so this might never happen again.
Y’a pas de français là 🙋🏼‍♂️🙃
Lost an adifice, pray no lost lives
Law enforcement was going to raid the church for child porn..they got wind and started a fire in attic to destroy evidence
An accident during Holy Week I’m not buying it
Jesus Christ older than this medieval mess!!!!! Where are the people gathering for him on these fine holy week days? I'll wait!
Knock it down build a Mosque
Youtube ban t series
This is Arson. All those centuries lighting the inside with candles and never burnt down
I hope Quazimodo is okay
Choose me or the fire
ninja did WHAT in Europe?!
I'm so depressed to see this . The sight of burning history makes my heart bleed . I hope much damage has not been done . I've been wanting to visit France since I was 12
I bet someone did it on purpose.
Time will tell.
New investment project ! The link in the description
It definitely will be rebuilt.
SOMEBODY DESTROYED MY PROPERTY TOO . BUMMER
If that was in USA 🇺🇸?
They would liberate North Korea for some reason.
Well at least the stone front/walls are left standing.  It is terribly sad but some of it will be salvageable. They will rebuild.  There is nothing else to do.
On rancho across from Santa Fe casino above it. We're they keep the white stripe tigers. Scared me stiff
Our Lady! Notre Dame! Priez pour nous! I wonder if this will spawn any "anti-Catholic" legislation? It is more than just a historical   monument. It is home to 1000's of Catholics
its just a building.
Who let charmander out again
Absolute tragedy. I'm not French, I'm not religious. It doesn't matter, this was a loss for everyone.
Ah yes macron taking notes from george bush I see.
That was funny no more Notre Dam 😂😂😂😂
I'm cant explain how the people feel I could feel their pain😪😪
Best coverage - thanks.
I can´t understand why that kind of cultural historical treasures like Notre Dame in Paris, France, isn´t protected with modern sprinkler systems and sensitive smoke and fire alarm systems, which would make that kind of massive disastrous fires impossible or at least fast and easy to extinguish before serious large scale structural damages?
God is in control. We can adore, worship , and hold value to worldly things but God has the last day so. Troy T the Editor. Power Players Online
It's a church !  It was touched by the mongol hord
I wonder if they had proper fire detectors and sprinkler systems etc. Why did it get so out of control?
This is so depressing
Tonight I cry and pray for the loss of such a sacred space 💔 I cry for the loss of a dream to see the magnificence that was this building. My heart goes out to you, anyone who feels the loss as deeply or more than I.
The host should’ve turned fire spreads off... smh
Renovation without proper safeguards led to this catastrophic disaster.
How can a raging fire when spread be controlled,other than selective operations aimed at salvaging transferable artifacts ,besides just waiting for the flames to die down ?
3 duality. Michael threatens 3DD collapse if you don't stop. Karma. .
THEY WON'T LET U TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN ERUOPE."NOT ON THERE WATCH".THIS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT.

BEAST SYSTEM MANIFESTING
The World Trade Center, with all it’s metal and concrete went down faster then this.
So sad to see and heard the news😓😓
wonder if there's any architect philosophers out there that can fix this problem.
When you think of Paris  notre dame  is one  of  its icons 
To watch it burn was distressing  a medieval  masterpiece 
I hope it rises from the ashes like a gallic Phoenix  
Vive la France  vive la notre dame  !!!!!!
ahh thats hot, thats hot.
The loss of those Stained Glass Windows is a tragedy. I feel kinda ill...
I would go there in AC unity but my disk set on fire
Good job 👍 1 million dollar donation to repair this building but no money for homeless people!! Very smart
Assassin's Creed can help rebuild Notre Dame
sounds like a yikes to me
UNBELIEVABLE! This is not just a loss for Parisians; this is a loss for all of Christianity just days away from Easter as well as a loss for Western civilization itself.
it took place in the holy week before Easter.
Accident? I think not
Toussaint Louverture did it🇭🇹
Multiple Goths have fallen
When you miss a duolingo lesson.
honestly, this is truly heart breaking. i never visited notre dame, but i imagine my great great great great grandparents likely visited before moving to america. my heart is with france tonight. god bless...
Ive never left my country never seen anything else except st cathrines ive missed so much
Did the hunchback escape?
A number of churches have caught on fire over a number of weeks.. a coincidence??? Obviously it's a religious motivated attack only they'll not tell you that...one fire possibly an accident but four and five I'd say not
FAKE-NEWS ! THIS WAS A BOMB !
It is a devastating loss for all.  So thankful no one lost their lives.
finally some vacant property to start walmart in europe
Let's go meme time
I think Jesus his close to us.
Macron you naughty boy 🔨
it's not 'just a building.' It stood for over 800 years, took 200 to build, and is the work so many dedicated believers.  We cannot begin to imagine how many people have visited Notre Dame, how many drew comfort from it, and how many, even if not Catholic,  treasured it as a symbol of Paris and the surrounding community. It was a work of art and an important piece of history.  Thank god no one lost their lives, and I believe they should rebuild, but it's a terrible loss.
Thumbtack. Stole me.
I want it gone forever
They could of put the fire out in about 5 mins...no matter how big the flames...with  SOUND..!!
Think it's a lot of hot air I tell you...some might say B/S... go check it out...2 young uni guys have found the frequency at which fire burns...go watch it...I kid you not...!...this was the work of the Illuminate..April is their month of "sacrifice by fire"...look it up...DO your research...you owe it to yourselves...
May God be with us all...
I have nothing but complete and absolute respect for those Firefighters. Extremely brave and absolute heroes they are.
Welcome to 2019. An optimistic year awaits us all.
C'est tellement triste, c'était un endroit magnifique! T-T    It's so sad, it was a beautiful place!
Europe has been lost to the towels
Jesus christ😭😭😭😭
That's a bruh moment
SIGNS OF THINGS TOO COME
Oh god frollo got his revenge
Burn like you burnt those heretics
I noticed inside....the Cross had survived the destruction.....it's a sign that hope is not lost. They will rebuild and it will last a thousand years.
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS DISNEY KNEW THE FUTURE???!!!
Sacrificial burn offering?
I feel bad that I dont share the same feeling. Very sad for Paris.
Broke a bone now replace it with a fake one.
The old world is crumbling.
Some didimt just get fired But had a capital punishment..
Trust the French to burn down a national treasure.
there is no lord but the one
guess television shows and movies predicted the future again

Like, didn't the tower of Notre Dame, burn down in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and the same thing has happened in reality years after the movie had come out. This isn't the first time that this has happened. One example is the Simpsons predicting Donald Trump's presidency way before it actually happened in 2016

This is quite fishy since Mainstream media has been able to predict real life events, years before happening, in television shows and movies. Such things as iconic as the Simpsons and Disney, are bound to place hidden predictions in shows, without us noticing
I just find it a coincidence that it happens on Holy week
Lol this!
Governance failure
what do you need for a roof , a saw, angel grinder, tape and a pencil, but it still catches fire??
Macron will blame an insane Dutchman
The Muslim population in France has taken credit for this atrocious act. The MSM will not report this.
BRUHHHH I DIDNT EVEN GET TO TRAVEL THERE YETTTTTT
Doctor: Sir, you have been in a coma since 1875
Man: Oh boy! I can't wait to see my favorite medieval icon, Notre Dame!
Doctor: Well, um.
So sad 😢 😢  😭😭😭 why did this had to happen 😭😭😭😭😭
At Least The Alter Boys are safe Now From the Priests...
i'm afraid this is just a fore-warning for France. this is your country now. utterly on fire and in chaos. heartbreaking.
Alright time to meme it
What people forget...Not only the fire but the water used to put it out will cause damage! 😐 This is the building that survived Hugenouts attack in the 16th Century Desecration during the French revolution, World war 1 and World war 2 but it is also the place where Mary Stuart Queen of Scots got married as well as James V not to mention the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte and the canonisation of Joan of Arc took place here as well as the requiem masses when DeGaulle died and later on Mitterand...That building IS Paris...
It was Ninja look at his Europe video
Should’ve left the statutes there. rip
Looks like a volcanic eruption, or like a bomb going off.just so very sad.such an old unique, iconic architecture. 😢
i hope they can rebuild it
T series is sub botting
Good they bands our memes
Can't  we get those renovators to come and work on the houses of parliament.
how did the fire start? Who was in the attic when the fire started? The 
workmen in the attic taking out statues for restoration, what are their 
backgrounds? Something is very suspicious here. This was a Catholic 
church. Represented Christianity for centuries. Just saying
State wouldn’t sell church for modern renovations, inside job.
Everybody if you see this
Please go to the CNN site or look up donate to Notre Dame rebuilding and give money
Guys this is history that burnt
Let’s help try and bring this back together
It was probably the work of Muslim vandals.
Quasimodo predicted this would happen in 2019 and was ignored. Some speculated he was basing his prediction on Nostradamus, others say he just had a hunch
Never been to France, never been to Europe. Never left the U.S., but this sure makes me sad. I've only seen it in pictures, but it was magnificent. I hope it gets rebuilt.
The vatican is next according to the bible
HELLFIRE. Hellfire
So much for the handy work of man. Goes down in rubbles and flames. 


But look at the brighter side.... it's brighter now.
Oh well 🤷
Find it odd that the French authorities have not mentioned what caused the fire. Typically the causes of fires are quickly deduced. I have worked on historic renovations over 10 years in various countries. I NEVER remember an instance when flammable materials where not carefully secured at all times.  I wonder if there was not purposely set on fire by a non-Frenchman?
PUT SOME HOLY WATER
Eyes opened slowly
why is everything bad happens on April 15th??
Some ones getting fired lmfaoo
I was in Paris, couldn't visit Norte Dame due to limited time, but outside architecture is amazing, beautiful It truly reflects the people amazing creativity and attention to details. Sad day for art and history.
Sad day sad moment.
Believe in jesus ot other
0:46 look in the smoke. That's a cross!
WE WILL SEE
This breaks my heart.
Albert Pike 3 world wars
Real news please stop spraying chemtrailes
One too many little boys got touched
OMG SO SAD 😱😪😢
This is pretty sad this historical land mark is permanently disfigured
What are they going to do with the remaining building, are they going to rebuild, are they gonna restore the insides of the remaining building, or are they gonna let it sit
Aha you sad c”nts
You can guess who will be cheering.
Well rip my dude
We must rebeild
Can we get an F in the chat?
pls back sub
I don't care how much hate I will get in these incessant comments. As a Muslim, it saddens me that such a church is ruined, a church is important as a mosque to a Muslim for they are both a place where people worship the one Lord.
Our world is ending
Euronymous and the boys would be happy
You’re name is backwards btw
Are church bells ok
France gave us the Statue of Liberty in 1886, I think it's long overdue to give back
Praise Altman!
I learned that punch from Bruce Lee.
Let's get F in the chat for respect
Ninja did this
It's sad because it was a symbol of the greathenss of humanity, this 10 full human lifetimes cathedral was a symbol of the eternal beauty and symbolism
Damn Jesus dropped some fire
Apparently everything else was covered in ash, except the one thing stayed untouched, the cross of Jesus
Was it set ablaze?
Waw thats great
It took 200 years to built...

and it only took 30 minutes to destroy
The Notre Dame football squad is reportedly unscathed.
cap dies in endgame
The news reporter face really sad 😥
The joker is back at it again
When I heard about this, I immediately thought this was a cause of arson...
Some turk did it...
The roof the roof the roof is on fire we don't need no water let the. Oh well never mind .. Would like to see Architectures try to rebuild it oh wait there to dumb nowadays would never be able to do that.
More space now to build a local mosque .
This is heartbreaking such a beautiful building
The same buildings we have already built in this generation will also be history at some point, and so on. Nothing lasts forever
😣🇸🇦-🇫🇷😢💔
This is epic
Somebody messed up big time.
I wonder if the 'experts' that Putin has offered to send are the same cathedral enthusiasts as the ones who visited Salisbury Cathedral last year?
My heart is breaking while watching this.
This is not only national disaster to France, but it is International disaster for all the Mankind. It was being saved by older generation even in the World War II. But we have to be shame as us as  today's generation, we couldn't save it for future. 


In today we are as human beings fail to protect  neither humanity (as many wars in the world in different ways) and neither their resources (like this Cathedral and many more around the world are being distracting.) So People rise for humanity and protect of mankind from their own disaster. 


Spread Loving Kindness and believe as all are from One God instead of many and respect to each other. Then world will be very pleasant place to mankind and all the beings. BS & GBY
Keywords    ..medieval.. architecture.....
OMG So sad...
We're sorry about this thing from Japan🇯🇵.
Quazimoto did it
It was the most beautiful building in Paris.
Remember old summer palace now ?
Why they did not use plane fire fighters
Poor Quasimodo
I wonder if the African man who scaled an apartment to save a child was there as a part of his job as a fireman, which came with his French citizenship.
Very sad to see 850 years of history and culture reduced to ruins in just over a few hours. However it will be rebuilt to its former glory and become a symbol of the human capacity for cultural recovery and renewal.
I blame gods indifference.
"Everything that has a beginning, has an end."
I hope we did a photogrammetric scan of it before it burnt.
Black market manage to save more than firefighters!!
Lovely to hear!
A heart-breaking day for France, and the entire world. Absolutely devastating. So surreal, to see history in such a way.
Use helicopters!
rest in flames
Well that building... is history.
I blame Frollo.
What words....... the cross survives.  During holy week.
The world on fire, it starts now. What will be the next... miracles r coming, believe or nor
Love you guys
Humans ruin everything
So sad day
800 years of history burned
What if someone put gasoline on the cathedral to get back at the government for raising gas prices
Could have been worse though, could have been one of our historic cathedrals...……...
Marcon or maricon?
I would like to kindly invite people in the comments to not rush to judgement, to not ruin the blessed memories of Notre Dame, while it still stands, with blind hate and distasteful jokes. Now, support and love for each other is needed more than ever.

I visited Notre Dame about 7 years ago, a place of immense unforgetable architectural glory, to me, it left a greater impact than the Eiffel Tower or any museum, it is the core art piece of Paris. Notre Dame is one of the few places that could make even a non-believer pray and left in awe.

I pray for the fire-fighters (where the hell are the helicopters btw?) and wish I could help contribute a bucket of water or something, it pains to just watch it burn.

Much love to all.
Three things to consider:
Le Bras Freres, a contractor noted for their many restoration projects of cathedrals throughout Europe and its skilled workers would have known better not to leave behind incendiary devices especially since the fire broke out when all the workers had left. It is not like they are still using candles or lanterns while working.

Inez Madani, an Islamic radical, was recently sentenced to jail for attempting to propane-bomb the cathedral in 2016. One would think that after this incident, security would have been tightened around the area.

The fire, if started by a candle or a faulty electrical wiring, would not have burned so fiercely and brilliantly. Regardless of the 800 year old age of the building, the intensity of the fire seem to be extraordinarily bright. Old wood are one of the hardest material to burn. One can only compare a burning campfire being doused by an accelerant. 

To claim that it was accidental is to divert further inquiries & investigations into the true cause. Certainly, it seems that “when there is smoke, there is fire.” And this smoke seems to be coming not from the cathedral but back to somewhere else.
I was there a couple months ago now to know it’s burning down
May God bless France and all the world. Love from Iraq to France.
It was arson.
Sums up the current state of affairs in France.
Notre Damn🍆😫🔥
vis major
Well that was a bad renovation work. What were the workers doing smoking near turpentine or paint.  😢
I had a dream last night that thousands of Muslims showed up and started
 helping with the rebuilding of this beautiful landmark of the world. 
Then I realized it really was just a dream.
As an American I'd rather lose several of our "landmark" buildings than an irreplaceable old world icon like Notre-Dame de Paris. I can't think of a more revered piece of Christian architecture excepting perhaps St. Peter's or the Hagia Sophia. So sad.
I very😢😢😢
was this sad event a natural mistake or has happened in purpose ??? The world is changing...
Oh Lord what a terrible shame
I hope the hunch back is alright
So many people are hating on this. Those people are disgusting. The Notre dame was one of the most beautiful buildings in Europe it was a revolution in engineering for its time and the cost is not just physical this is a catastrophic event. I'm not Christian and I've wanted to visit it before. It will take generations to fully restore. And even then it shall never be the same so many people's live quiet literally went into this building and so many of them can never be replaced. Some of the wood works in there were art in themselves and they are gone forever now but ash when once they were proud pieces, many stones will fall to never be raised again. This is not just a loss for France this is a loss for the world. Our sympathies from new Zealand. We will help how we can.
I burned the Cathedral. 👌🏾😆
All the comments are just memes lmao F
It’s was a sad day😢
DAMN IT QUASI
I saw this on a Simpsons cartoon what a shock.Our government is so evil and mentally ill I would hate to see what happens to them in the end.Lord have some mercy on their souls it's going to be real bad for them.
Re build again
Turn turnt
Burn



BURNT
Finally something not in america
Another devastating blow to France and its dying culture. Horrific and sad beyond words
I am from macau
马克龙执政，Notre dame cathedral 都自焚了。
Might god wants that
Haha wyh iz thare no poliz offisers thare to put aut the fier
The ironic and symbolic significance is staggering! This is affront on the female manifestation of God. The timing of it and religious implications are truly heartbreaking and startling!
Literally no one:

Reddit: 😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Future generations would not be able to see it
All man done
10 Churches were attacked in one week even before this one was burned, it's not accident it's an attack.
850 years old. Sheesh this just so sad in so many ways
是个很大的损失……
I bet ninja did this
What is the name of this reporter? She did an excellent job. She didn't over blow it for sensation. She delivered the news appropriately and dressed elegantly to show sadness! I stopped watching news that look for viewers by flashing cleavage from the women and trouser bulge on the men. This was well done. I can only imagine that collective silence! Just found it.. Sophie Raworth - well done!
😭😭😭😭Oo Notre-Dame 😭😭😭😭
Most people being silent, yes, but believers also sang a lot of religious songs while kneeling down. It is after all the beginning of the Holy week of Easter.
It is interesting to have watched it and say "I remember when the Notre Dame burned down" just like the day of 9/11...
I  feel bad 😢
This is terrible, Pray for Paris
Got Jesus Christ Everyone?
Truly symbolises the death of western culture.
Holy smokes #1safe1not
and then... the fire nation attacked-
So sad... 😧😔
Notr Damn
Oh no! Such a beautiful and iconic historical building! :(
Let´s hope the main structure remains standing as a landmark for its cititzens to enjoy. Then something will be saved.
TÜRKLER BURDAMI !
good good . please more fire . i am so happy
So sad 😐😐
I agree
this is genuinely so sad, future generations will never see this...
I have known of a lot of building that have burned, because of debt. and it is always electrical.
Room 8 killer. Your war Crimea are mounting. The teenage psychotic is what Mathew calls you. Rachel maddo. She seems to think I'm her....
Why :(
The Catholic Church is asking the world for money towards rebuilding Notre Dame when the Catholics bask in a paradise of gold & wealth... Then again they need help due to their losses towards abuse lawsuits!
The workers needed 200 years to build Notre Dame, the fire needs 200 minutes to destroy nearly all...
Why they put it on fire ?
聖母院不是僅僅作為一個藝術博物館存在，而是人類主流社會天主教基督教的宗教精神象徵之一，這與阿房宮和圓明園是人類社會暴戾腐朽的無神論奸惡蠢惡權貴存在象徵是本質完全不一樣的存在。
I hope the hunchback is ok.
how sad...another symbol of our culture, art and civilization is gone...my heart cries with all parisians today
At 0:46 seconds, there is a white cross in the sky
Guess quasi moto can't help here (sp? If spelling is right thumbs up).
I saw. A tourist wearing  a t shirt that said: my dad went to Paris and all I got was this burned up t shirt.
Thoughts and Prayers from Egypt
I would have cried too
Hold on while I try to care, people are raising money to rebuild it but doesn’t the Catholic Church have enough money already?
BURN BABY BURN!~
This is so sad
" However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands" Acts 7:48.
This is all your fault Sandusky!
Are you kidding me? Now I’ll never be able to watch the hunchback of notredame again
Any word on the Hunchback? Did he get out? I have a hunch he perished,. No longer a member of the Parish.. Yet will always be ours...our  Humpback of Paris.
Guys, do something about this! French people, what are guys doing, take care of your place?!!
I love the BBC...what a classy and respectful group of journalists..especially during crisis!  Im ashamed to even watch American news channels becoming nauseous with all the sensationalism and over dramatic words...I am sad for our French brothers and sisters of faith!!!
I'm french...
is it true that it has alot of devil statues?
Terrorism not construction
Are they gonna repair
Lets hope there was video surveillance....I doubt this was caused by renovations.
これを見てうれしい
Great news💯👍
DAmn. I dont mean to joke but...did Judge Claude Frollo not find his Gypsy again? But seriously. I am so sorry for Paris loss
what about Quasimodo, is he ok?
My thought same wth ppl in Paris. We lost that and we pray everything will be fine
I was praying and I said King David and the cloud turned around with a face on it . I was sober on the way to work.
Let's go
It was the kkk burning the cross!
Le groupe punk a sorti une vidéo prophétique une semaine avant les tristes événements de Notrdam de Paris !!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAdUkSDRKz8
I had the honour and pleasure of walking into Note Dame Cathedral it took my breath away and I spent the next 30 minutes crying and experiencing the power of our Heavenly Father there in this most beautiful yet quiet place.  I cried watching it burn yesterday and prayed to God to help all those fighting this fire., and to bring peace to the French people in their hour of need.  My hats off to all those brave and wonderful Firemen who risked so much to bring it under control. Also, bless those that were able to save the relics.  France will rebuild and it will just as beautiful.
Vatican City Next ...you can only imagine the unspeakable foul acts performed by the Cardinals Priests and Bishops over the time since the Church was erected. And don't say it never was. You value the innocence of artifacts. The indulgence of opium whilst the feasted on the innocence and took advantage of their youth.
I say let all those foul  Churches Burn. And again this was no accident ...it was purposely done
listen this happending makes no sense 

1. The building is super old ! And WW1 and WW2 Happend close enough to it and it was fine 

2. I’m pretty sure this building has no electric wires or anything like that how in the hell would the fire start ? 

3.a week before Easter huh ? What are u dumb this is an Arson 

4. The building is 850 years old AND ITS REMAINED FINE HOW DID IT CATCH ON FIRE
Ninja did it
Is it real that French  government asked us raise money?
One of my favorite landmarks😭😭
Here is another thought. And I guess in many quarters it will go down badly. So be it. But the truth is the truth. The French Government "leases" the grand old church for a certain fee.....which amounts to not ONE cent. To a certain "Church." Secondly, my understanding is that "Churches" get very special tax concessions, even if they do pay tax. I am not an expert on this. Thirdly, I believe thousands upon thousands of folks visit this grand edifice....daily....at a fee, and has for years upon years. So, this happens, a cry goes out for donations, I hear millions / billions pledged.


Here is my question. What about the hundreds of millions upon millions collected over the years? Who pocketed it? Oh well.......I rest my case.
signs
Heart burning feelings
hot dame
I believe in jesus Christ, still saying that jesus is coming very soon ,give your life to jesus he is the only way the truth and life.
It’s just a mf church wtf
atleast we got a free assassins creed game out of it :)
A month ago, the Saint Sulspice church in paris was on Fire. Notre Dame and Al Aqsa mosque burnt on the same day. Who are the culprits ? Read Revelation 3.9
This is just the first of MANY MORE TO COME!
On this Day:
> The Titanic sank, 
> National Tax Day in the United States,
> District of Columbia celebrates Emancipation Day,
> 
>  

&
>  -> @ April 15. 😥
God help them...
Oh no. Crap, that's so sad.
MACRON'S FRANCE
And what the BBC doesn't mention are the dozens of Christian churches that have been vandalised over the last year or so. 

The media are blaming the construction company before the investigation has barely begun. 

They ignore the fact that churches have been increasingly vandalised since the mass immigration from Muslim countries.
The art lost alone was probably priceless.
vivre le france
we’re with y’all
Mourn the loss of an old building. This however was NEVER a monument to Christ,  Rather to  a man made power structure known as Catholicism which masquerades  as a route to Jesus, and Heaven.
Let me know when Vatican 🇻🇦 starts burning...
One of the most iconic and legendary medieval structures burns down - 2 million views

73 questions with Kim Kardashian - 22 million views 

what is wrong with people
This was a terrible person if someone di this burn Notre Dame ♥💙😢 a historical society of France Paris this is a terrorist attack the government of France needs to fine out what and answer questions 😔
Realizing that it’ll go down in history ...
It took 3 generations to build it
675 million dollars to rebuild in less than a week... Imagine if that money was used to feed the hungry before this all happened. I guess the rich dont shell out until they see the tragedy in their backyard.
pray to jesus for rebuild this
If it's ever restored or rebuilt it won't be 800 years old and its authenticity would be lost.
Nothing happens for 800 years. 6.8 million dollar projects happens. HHHMMMMMMMMM Wonder what it could have been
Brought a tear to my eye.such a shame
fire brigade have no copter squads ?
That's crazy cause history is just crumbling before their eyes.
How many Christian places of worship have burnt down in the past four years?
Yaaaa that’s hot🔥🔥
MERCI
This is the 4th church to be vandalized this year in france, its happening all to often now , this was no accident
Notre dame est en flammes. C'est juste terrible. Terrible. Elle est avec le pays depuis 800 ans. Mon coeur est brisé.

Je prie que nous pourrons reconstruire la structure endommagée tout en nous souvenant des jours plus anciens, preuve de notre humanité persistante sur cette planète.
Billy Joel's we didn't start the fire

Meu Deu  eu lamemdo muimdo
BBC is fake news
This has not hurt chistanaty.,only made it stronger, preys  JESUS.
This is why you never go with the low bidder on any construction project.
Thanks, Macron - you sick jerk
I never imagined it to become history
Then it burned down
Saddest moment 😢😢😢😢
I visited and went through to see it in 1984. Hope the blueprints, artisans  and materials are available to rebuild it. (Just as all was cleaned up after WW2 bomber squadron damage).
They mean a catholic icon.
Just another building, rebuild in five years?What a knee jerk reaction.
First twin towers now noted dame. The government
SET ON FIRE DELIBERATELY
Dont worry, its insured.  A holy mosque will be built in place of it.  No problem.
Strange never I read information s manifest yellow west
The France is dictature the manisfestation are prohibited
The people are arrested for nothing
The French ask ric frexit but Macron doesn t like
Few people haven t hand or eyes for the policies violence
À day the French people ask thrue at all journaliste than said nothing
Free for the France
Yellow west here for ever for have a life with dignités
The people are arrested before the manifestation
Don t forget a day the thrue arrive
Are the gargoyles saved? Gargoyles on a church.......
Everything has its time. Everything dies.
Heartbreaking to see the beautiful building burning. What a lost to the world,  it can be rebuilt but  all the history that goes along with it makes the place priceless. Just devastating to all those who one day wanted to see it. Bless all the people of this beautiful  place.
Jesus would say no to the massive amounts of money to rebuild and he would want it to go to homeless people
I would like to get a FULL explanation HOW that fire started.... not all this senseless blah blah
Restauration worker: Puts on Cigarette right next to high flammable stuff

High flammable stuff: immediately catches fire and everything goes up in flames

Restauration worker: „Oh.”
What we have lost is a great work of ART - That's what is valuable, and that's what's worth recreating.  Anything else is a mislabeling and a distraction from the truth.
At 45 Secounds Into The Video Check The Right Top Side Of The Screen And Theres A Cross In The Smoke Its White no joke really
مشاركين بقتل لمسلمين.. ستأتي الطامهٌ الكبرى وعد
Somebody is going to get yelled at for this one
Never even got to see it 😢
did enyone die
Looks like 2019 isn't the best year for history
Babylon is falling
Ok but can we stop pretending the building was a person that passed away like wtf lol.
我是来练习听力的
The tragedy that happened this time is reported in the news a lot in Japan and many people are surprised
I pray in Japan from the bottom of my heart that the people in Paris will return to their original form as soon as possible.
Sad to see the destruction of the beautiful Notre Dame Cathedral. Hopefully the French will be able to rebuild the Cathedral.😢😢
RIP Quasimodo :o(
many wished it destroyed completely, tough luck because stone does not burn
Them: oh no the building collapsed
Me : It’s a building I never heard of no one died
The only church that illuminates is a burning church.
A symbol of the fall of western civilization.
Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them
Chistanaty is not made of wood.
Build on lies, torture...a cleansing!
I swear to you that I know a 7,000-year-old building
Internationally renown symbol of Catholicism oddly catches fire during holy week👀🧐🧐🧐 suspicious much?
Lol..
Why?😭
Was it arson ?
DAMN ITS SO LIT TO SEE THIS ALMOST AS LIT AS THE CHURCH ITSELF
850 years old, and it took 200 years to make.  Which makes it 1,050 years old.
Inside job
Why are you scrolling through the comments there was a fire!
Arson!!!!
It will take considerable investigating to find the truth out about this.  I would trust what the mass media says is the cause of this not at all.
IM SO HAPPY
A SERBIAN CHURCH WHETHER FRENCH BONUS SURVIVE?
Why is this trending #1 this actuallly important this part of history getting destroyed
I have little faith in the restoration, because I just know they will grab this oppurtunity to make some "modern" additions like a glass roof, or skylights or some other shit, architects have no respect for traditional architecture these days.
This happens right before easter that is just sad
im happy it burned now i got a free assassins creed unity :D
😭 全人类的损失 😭
The power of fire. Unbelievable
Micron says he'll rebuild it.
this hits me in an emotional place that I didn't realize it held. it's like seeing an old friend hurt and mamed bit not being able to help.
Is this museum made from papers how it burn easily like this .
7:03 Is that one of Quasimodo friend?🤔🤔
It's too long. This is why I watch inside edition 😂
Our Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon,let us prepare our hearts ,these are the signs
An accident in holy week not buying it
Such is the state of the world.
🥺😔😢
Is this the first attack of the demon king..........I’m sorry everyone I thought I finished him with my flame lotus.
It started 6 days before Easter sunday... hmmm
850 years old Wow

About time......
我觉得是伊斯兰难民烧毁的，这么多年都没事不可能就这么烧了
This is 🇫🇷 france's 911. ..
It's not a terrorist attack by ISIS they would've already said something about it, it's just probably a human error that caused this fire. In my hometown we had that happens too next to an old house they build a mall and renovated the old house right next to the mall they just built but than for some reason the (I'm German it just forgot the word it's the opposite of basement) started to burn and than the roof was on fire but it was just a 3 story building so the firefighters did their job and only the inside had some damage on the top and few parts of the roof but that's it

I imagine something similar happened in Paris because the workers also were done for the day here in my hometown but than tone of the workers smelled fire so I guess whatever happened in my hometown also happened in Paris
From 0:46 to 0:47 there’s a cross that comes through in between the smoke...anyone see it..?..
WoW OmG sO sAd
Oooof such a nice work of art.
On the bright side....they’re all set for Ash Wednesday 2020.
I'm an atheist, and I don't respect this religion in the slightest. That being said; this is a terrible tragedy. The things that this hand built beauty lived through; to come down like this.........the thing is as a construction worker I know a building this old is  kindling...........absolutley terrible.
Inside job, to slowly but for surely erase religion in France
Karna gw gak bisa bhs inggris komen bhs indonesia aja lah.
Semoga diberi kesabaran pada keluarga korban maupun pemilik perusahaan , amin
watch it turn out that one of the workers on that portion that was being renovated tossed his cigarette on the roof
it's was soo fun
Yes thé enemy tried to do this To st sulpice  two........week ago it is not an accident... it is an attack 
 Macron is behind it after all he is one of thoses...it is an act of War against  Christian France....
It is NOT an accident
Anyone else not knows what is happening??
Wolverines !
this is a very sad news for the world, i hope the france people could stay stronger. i dont know if any of you believe this or not. certian status has their magic function and balance the magnetic field. such as the chinese stone lion and dragon status. why the poeple remove the status from the church, i dont know if they get some advise before take the action.
Notre dame belonged to everyone, it has been apart of everyone's life
So sad and completely irresponsible.  It really pisses me off.
The disney movie but live action
Unlucky😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Watch, a mosque will be built on top or nearby
This is horrible how can it big church like that just burn so quickly and burn at least for half of it I'm sure it wasn't an accident I'm sure that it was prepared and it wasn't just one person that prepared that. We really have to talk about it and Jesus Christ Crown was in there and a lot of things were in there that lasted at least 850 years. This is sad but at least they're still a Jesus cross left that means that there is still hope. Keep praying for others and keep thanking God for what you have. I hope this will never happen again because this was one of the most important churches of the world I hope Paris will get better sooner because a lot of bad things are happening in this world but God will be with us. Imagine seeing it all burn down
Sad to see it survived WW2 but couldn't survive some 21st century idiots rebuilding it.
Good old thick white smoke... and my oh my are those flames extremely bright.
Also, how did they rule out arson within hours of it extinguished  when it takes a significant amount of time to conduct an arson investigation. 
Unfortunately, something fishy is afoot
Don't worry about that building god never sleep god working mystery way they worship all kinds of animals in that building
So y’know that song hellfire
There sadder at a building then back in the day when they got terrorised
I can't say anything. I am sad ( from Azerbaijan)
Maybe some priest took a nap and left his candle burning
Why didn’t God put the fire out?
Now I'm going to burn down the Notre Dame my friend built on Minecraft.
5:37 omg it was so beautiful😭😍 makes me want to cry😭
Fire started soon after
Last of the Visitors left
But just like 9-11
They repeat a script about the cause
Before any Investigation of the real cause
Maybe because it was too old, then just rebuild it....
Cross in the smoke at 0:46
Flint still doesn’t have clean water.

Y’all have a nice day.
Do not just pray for fun!
Major historical disaster, great loss. So sad.
Condoléances 💐 mon dieu..
Thank god I’m an atheist
IT NEVER FAILS THAT SOMEONE WILL TEST THE LORD'S POWER. YAHWEH CREATED THE FIRE . HE CAN MOVE IT.
France just keeps on sucking day by day. I wouldn't be surprised if the Eiffel Tower somehow collapsed. How can a structure that has stood all these years finally succumb to fire?
When franse need money
It will be rebuilt. Good that the flames didnt claim any life because we can't restore life.
Go watch the video "I, Pet Goat II". This was planned. The end times are near. Christ will return.
France can't catch a break the last few years!!!
Hugs to the French people.

Such is the fate of all that is material.
the world is in crusade so i call upon crusaders to fight this holy war
#ripheathledger
Such a beautiful architecture now In flames what ashame
we should rebuild with golden roofing on top
I only knew about this building from assassins creed unity
The movie The hutchback from Notre Dame was named after that cathedral.
Praise God the pagan Temple is destroyed and burned! This is a biblical event!!
I am an American living in Washington. I am so saddened by this horrific event. I cried when I saw the devestation! My heart goes out to the French people, and for all the people who share this tiny planet. I mourn the historic, and shared, loss for all of us!
We know that    "Someone, did Something bad"....
听不懂
Nobody's notice the Cross at 0:46 ?
What a Beautiful sight!!!
Thought and prayers to Notre Dame 💓
Yah yah yah... it doesn't even matter
This is definitely staged
The first time that people actually grieved for the loss of no one except a building.
Haha I hate france
Im so sad about this my prayers are with them
BBC 4,000,000 subscribers!! Oh dear!
hi guys a mosque has also been caught on fire in Palestine but go off
The only reason why the Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire was because they were recreating a scene from Huntchback Of Notre Dame movie.
liberal bbc wouldn't tell you who did it, even if they knew.
So sad
If the wood was 8 hundred years old the sun can burn it easily, any way we have greenhart and purplehart wood that can last forever. Come to Guyana and buy these wood to rebuild.
honestly this is the saddest thing of my entire life. is it the yellow jackets. fuck whoever did that. that building was amazing and perfect
I see in my dream the sky was covered with God's war plane.  Then a lot of people sitting on the beach.  when the first plane arrives.  And they started throwing stone on the small plane that landed, and then they ended up destroying the plane.  And the sky is covered with a big plane.
We will rebuild, and it will stand for longer!!!
This is such a historical loss, I will never forget visiting this wonderful cathedral. My thoughts are with all of France.
Let all of them burn
Lmao
Lmao
I cried. What a tragedy. Love from Utah
Lmao
Unlucky
This was not an accident.
I tell you who have possibly done this! Its those damn atheist!
Ce trist!!!Ce pierdere imensa!!!!Mult curaj Franța!!!
太可惜了
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂😂😂
Damn...what a good time to be alive...I'm been watching a lot of things that have been going doen lately...shootings...internet control...and a lot more
That's sad but the important thing is no one got hurt or died !
A blessing is some relics will have survived because there were moved a week before because of the fire. People all around the world have been touched by this tragic loss sending prayers to the people of Paris and France. May rebuilding also help rebuild unity of   the people.
This is a devastating fire. But it doesn't surprise me this is what happens when you sell out the people of your country and you lied to them. Unfortunately there are probably more bad things coming as an indirect result of all the BS happening in Europe and of course France will never admit it because they sold their people out
Anyone else think it's pure coincidence that an icon of Christianity (full of priceless art treasures) goes up in flames at the start of Holy Week? 

Nope, me neither.
Je voudrais exprimer mes sincères condoléances à la cathédrale Notre-Dame et à l’ensemble de la France.
I Pet Goat II
👏👏👏
So much publicity to fire breaking out in a church WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT MASJID E AQSA FIRE THAT OCCURED AT THE SAME TIME???
kingdom hearts predicted it. gg!
just don't understand why they did not used helecopter to put out the fire..
Hope For the Future. We heal. We rebuild. (I Lost almost everything but the clothes on my back to a house fire) The path is in not giving up Hope.
Insurance money
Luck Of Respect ......  Oh NO!  You WILL GO UP High ......  More Building WORK To DO ......  WHAT CAN You Do?  THAT What STAYS ..  A STONE HeriTAGE That Gives You The FIRE - 🔥  LOOK AFTER The World's HISTORY .....  BLESS .....
Thankfully the stone outside is still standing along with the two iconic bell towers still stand. Many Resources will be key to rebuild. It would take years and millions to restore it. May the lord bless Paris and the world after this loss of a clumsy person
I'm so heart broken alot of Churchs in my city in Massachusetts had people gather for prayers
Very sad. Its a harritage. Very painful for franch people.

Very strange as in the last chapter of the novel the cathedral is set on fire!
THIS LADY NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS WILL NOT REMAIN DOWN
https://youtu.be/Ct_w2YCPXSI
The good news in all this is, that no one died in this fire, while wood and stone can be replaced, and even improved, despite the haters. Hopefully, the future roof will be made if possible, of non-flammable material, like steel and aluminum beams, including the spire; and like a phoenix rising from its ashes, maybe this old cathedral could become better than ever, as a model for environment friendly clean energy with new generation solar panels roofing, like a shining beacon on the whole world.

CETTE DAME NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS NE RESTERA PAS VAINCUE

La bonne nouvelle dans tout cela, c'est que personne n'est mort dans cet incendie, alors que le bois et la pierre peuvent être remplacés, voire améliorés, malgré les haineux. Espérons que le futur toit sera fabriqué, si possible, en matériau ininflammable, comme des poutres en acier et aluminium, y compris la flèche; et comme un phénix renaissant de ses cendres, peut-être même que cette vieille cathédrale pourrait devenir mieux que jamais, comme un modèle d'énergie propre et plus respectueux de l'environnement, avec une toiture de panneaux solaires nouvelle génération, comme un phare sur le monde entier.

Reporter says the fire started on the roof !!! WTF ...what a joke ..
What was the cause actually?
Sorry to everyone in France for your loss. A few weeks ago we lost are beautiful 2 year old dog to a speeding truck that didn’t see her. A sad but gentle reminder from the heavens above that nothing in this material world lasts forever, no matter how badly we want it otherwise, whether 2 or 850 years old. Puts things in perspective on what matters most. To love and cherish each other and the world around us for this brief and fleeting moment in time. ❤️
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This Is Absolutely TRAGIC !!!!
Who cares??? They burned it purposely in order to build some other pagan structure for even more wicked acts.
Call the Pope if you stop the video at 47 a cross appears
So Sad...silence for notre dame....what is  with people os Syria, Palestina, Afrika....Burn madaf...Burnnn
Let that MF Burn!!
Built in 200 years.
She is now 855 years old.
Paris was built around her.
And our families grew up with her.
But her beauty touches everyone.
She's not dead, she's just going to need time to get back on her feet.
The main one is saved, even if the roof dating back to the 13th century has disappeared and its loss is irreplaceable as other unique and precious parts have also disappeared in the flames.
But the motto of Paris, also dating from the Middle Ages is: "Fluctuat nec mergitur" → "he is beaten by the waves but does not sink".  ;)
Notre-Dame will rise again and Paris too.
Thank you for your support, your prayers.
From France.
So do you think the person who started the fire is going to lose his job?
😭😭😭😭😭
☹️😥😢
I honestly don’t care
Architectural art and history just gone like that. :(
Lit
Why y'all not talking bout the one in Brazil??
Surprised how quickly Notre Dame burnt. Could it be another "False Flag" to bring in the NWO and one NWO Religion? I'm sadden to see the destruction of such world heritage and relic.
So sad😭
My sympathies due to this loss

But seriously folks BBC is fake news
Deleterious, but not as deleterious as the depravity of mankind.
Sad moment because this is proud of france
☹️
My god all the history gone
Isnt it something, that if theres no God and purpose to life, then this is all humanity has to look forward to....just destruction.....whether it be everything burning, or the sun burning out..but its definitely been proven by science that we humans only have so long till the sun goes out, or the universe keeps expanding..and then buildings like this wont have to much meaning to people at that point....
Talk about the 12 other church burning in France in the last month....
That sucks
Just a solid reminder to have excessive fire extinguisher and emergency water sprinklers when you have a place like this
A glass roof will be amazing, but nothing can replace the history - the love - the awe of the centuries and the ghosts of those amazing people who imagined and built it.
That sucks
AMATERASU!
This makes the 4th Cathedral in France that has been on fire recently
But the twin towers dropped within minutes right?
prob something to do with isis
The destruction of Notre dame de Paris, in a sense of regret, should not forget that France burned the summer palace in Beijing in 1860.A hundred years later, the French also felt the pain of a national palace of art being burned down.
:(((
Why is this ONLY being talked about as a building?!?!?!?! This is a place of worship! My prayers for all those Catholics who are left without their place of worship, especially during Holy Week
Would also that the cathedral could speak and reveal how many episodes
of pedastry those wicked catholic monks
and priests sought to conceal through the long, dark centuries of popery.
I am so saddened by this fire. I live in Fresno, California, United States, and my well wishes and prayers go out to the people there in Paris! I am so sorry!
THEY are burning history.

Isn't the multicultural weapon a wonderful thing for the international criminal corporate cabal?
Why didn't they use helicopters?
Amen
in 2016, i was lucky enough to travel to Paris and London with my Girl Scout Troop, after years of hard work to raise money... I personally hate religions... I'm a Satanist... (look it up before you call me a "devil worshiper"). but the churches... oh god.. they were my favorite part of the entire trip. seeing the beauty and history... i can't even really remember what they looked like on the inside, but i remember how i felt walking in there.. and seeing the gorgeous architecture... i can literally feel my heart breaking as i watched this... tears came rushing to my eyes when i saw the reality of the situation... i can only say thank god nobody was hurt... physically...
ITS FUNNY THE SHOCK OF THE WORLD EVERY TIME HE DOES IT. NO WARNING ,JUST LIKE A THEIF IN THE NIGHT. THE CROSS RIDICULES JESUS CHRIST.
🇫🇷
I wrote  a poem about this

This building, that we have adored,
Since the start of time - or nearly.
But now these flames, atop wooden boards,
Dance so fast and freely.

Bright red demons thrash about,
Tearing down white marble,
And children cry, and adults shout, 
As they watch the giant candle.
🇫🇷
QUASIMODO
800 year old cathedral partly catches fire and everyone is in tears

Rainforests that have stood for millennia full of animals and more beauty burns/gets chopped down and no one cares.
People should start a charity to help save the soul of france
Arson? In this day and age the question is worth asking and it would not surprise me for it to be so. Rebuild? What on earth could possibly recapture the pure majesty surely not
a project for 'modern' architects! Perhaps the best approach would be to let the surviving intact stone structure segments be testament to it's past glory. Just my opinion.
So no one knows how this started?? I’m so confused
so sad 850years long history burned
Within one week there is 700 million for rebuild.if somewhere is a disaster where people die, with most difficulties 10 millions they get .and this church has over billions on bankaccount
I hope this was an accident because if it was set on purpose, well then prepare for a shit storm of fighting , so sad to see this beautiful architecture lost, our thoughts are with you over there 🇨🇦
waow :o
How did it happen
Nobody is talking about masjid al aqsa though
“Tempus edax, homo edacior.”
I’m more pissed cause the hunchback is now homeless
The Trump administration is responsible for this. Open your eyes
🥺
The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.
Wow feel sad for French people
0:45 - 0:47 why is there a white cross made out of light clearly visible in the smoke? :'D
Is nobody gonna explain why aren't the smokes black? What could cause that?
This is horrible how can it big church like that just burn so quickly and burn at least for half of it I'm sure it wasn't an accident I'm sure that it was prepared and it wasn't just one person that prepared that. We really have to talk about it and Jesus Christ Crown was in there and a lot of things were in there that lasted at least 850 years. This is sad but at least they're still a Jesus cross left that means that there is still hope. Keep praying for others and keep thanking God for what you have. I hope this will never happen again because this was one of the most important churches of the world I hope Paris will get better sooner because a lot of bad things are happening in this world but God will be with us
Shame it wasn't all of France in flames
Llllllmmmmmmaaaaaooooo what nnnnnnooooooooobbbbbbbssssss
where is quasimodo going to live now:(
It’s Free Will people look it up
An inside (Mossad) job....like the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York.
Like the Reichstag fire which was used to radicalize Germany in preparation for WW II.

Google: Larry Silverstein, Building 7.
Georgia Guidestones
What time is cerfew for the alter boys at the Father who art in heave alter boy dance night?  When the big hand is on the little hand....
When is France gonna pay Haiti back the gold its owes Haiti.
Superstitious theory; they took the gargoyles off for the renovations, gargoyles are considered the guardians of the cathedral...just a thought. Also it's a sick irony that this would happen when they are renovating...
Im sorry let's see here we care about some man made building?? Please we need to start careing about real stuff like lost souls that need to find Jesus. Common wake up everyone.
This is awful to see A history in ruins!!! A big loss not only for france also for the next generations
There were lighting my sisters candle and some other kids with D.I.PG
😂😂😂😂😂😂
April 15, 2019 A war has occurred a battle France is fighting against a fearless opponent. A day in history where in the books it will say not human purposely destroying it it was a fire that we can only watch happen France we are with you and the world will see it become rebuilt thank you you historical building an may the art loss be remembered by our picture as it won't be the same
200 years down the drain
Even if France goes under and disappears into Oblivion...No one cares..NEXT!
Suzanna maria Emmanuel explains all...read sovereign lord Emmanuel’s book...the truth will set us free.
I see millions in money has been pouring in for the restoration job. I understand the building is of historic/cultural importance, but other humanitarian projects are crying out for funds.. Its sad the that we lose our priorities. Notre Dame will be rebuilt, it's a building it will outlive us all. Sadly there are people's lives, right now, that need more support.. Saddens me how we get our priorities so so wrong.
My heart is broken. I even have no chance to visit this place. All history and beauty ...
Pagpalain kayo ng diyos Francia
OH NO  ITS 9,11 ALL OVER AGAIN!!
Wow 850 years old. I wish I could go. Sad how did this happen I didn't watch the whole thing yet I hope they find the person that did this if somebody did do it. Most likely that's the case. Trying to think positive.chuuuuu
Twin towers?
Right before Good Friday and Easter Sunday. This...was no renovation accident.
Usually Jesus hates trailer parks and there are tornados. But Jesus was mad at the church for child molesters the church has protected.
C'est dommage que la France ait perdu quelque chose d'important pour le monde.  Que Dieu bénisse tous les chrétiens et les parisiens.
RIP
Really!!!!!!
Who ordered the moving of valuable artefacts the week before the fire?
Rip
RIP
Burn hahahahaha.What about the Black Churches that were burned on March in Louisiana, the former french territory. Karma hahaha.
875 of France’s 42258 have been desecrated, vandalised and some even set on fire. 
11 Christians are killed everyday in North Africa because of their faith. 
238 in one weekend in June 2018 Nigeria.
Estimated 900,000 murdered in North Africa and the Middle East in the last decade
and yet barely any reports from Western Newspapers.
And then they declare Notre Dame an accident before the fire is even finished and before investors can be let in. 
Shame on all of you. 
There is a higher authority who’s judgment you will never escape.
We have been to see it it’s absolutely devastating to see it in such a state Paris have been through a lot and I would like to pay my respects
Why are we worried about something when people in Africa are starving who gives to f about the history of that we got people dying and homeless and we worry about this...
DONT CRY.
Пиздец
Let it burn
How could a fire be so large????  It is so suspicious to me.
They burning up all them secrets of them priest touching them lil kids
How?
Europe is lost, time to cut the rope.
Oops
Condolences from India
La France reconstruira sa cathédrale comme elle s’est reconstruite après les révolutions française et les différentes guerres, solidarité
.
I dont get it . Why are people upset? No one got killed right?
What a fascinating dichotomy. The Yellow vests are being tear gassed, shot, water cannoned, beaten, blinded, having their bank accounts closed down and thrown in prison for protesting a living wage while their government pledges billions to rebuild an old church.  Its going to be a long hot summer in France this year.
😎
o no ;~;
Whodunnit?
Justice beale is a joke an clearly not fit to hold the position that he does.no wonder domestic violence is on the rise in this country  when there is such ridiculous sentences handed down like that shame shame on u Beale how do u sleep at night he should be removed from his position immediately what a joke you are......
Oh that’s hot, that’s hOt
Spiritual wars!.Draw close to God.Nothing is more important Walk with Jesus..... evil and deception abounds!
