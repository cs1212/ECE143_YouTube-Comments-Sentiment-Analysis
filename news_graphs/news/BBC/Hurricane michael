Much panic and distrustion had been made

The angry version of Mother Nature 
The destroyer 😱
Looks like people didn't pray hard enough.
God bless world
Nice video but bad news.
Forget "thoughts and prayers" try donating money to the Red Cross/Crescent, Save the Children or UNICEF. Text SAFE to 70008 to donate £5 to Save the Children' Indonesia Tsunami Appeal...USA still has the tattered remnants of FEMA, help the people with no such safety net. Thanks
Nature doesn’t give af.
Andrew was way more destructive
Subhan allah toba allah
More footage of the storm in a 40 second clip than was shown on most of American news. You Brits have it pretty good over there, at least in unbiased news coverage. Meanwhile, I'm stuck in America which is being run by a rabid orangutan enabled by a gruop of chimpanzees who say that this hurricane was a hoax.

😤 This is Donald Trump's Fault! 😤
Lets continue to believe climate change isn't real :)
More jobs!! On Trump time he gets the credit.
Canadian trees would have stayed standing in that little breeze!
hitting Trump supporting climate chnage deniers
Hurricanes make rich people into homeless people . Its a learning opportunity . Be thankful .Pull yourself up by the bootstraps rich coastal  hurricane victims , Get a job , no welfare in insurance claims . seems like two different world now .  We should not spend one dime in relief on these lazy hurricane survivors . They made there choices . LOLOLOL 
Hurricane Food relief and bottled water welfare queens 😂 . I think my point is clear .
This is terrible. It's Rick Scott's Katrina. The same goes for trump.  Trump's off having a far-right rally with our tax dollars, and Americans in FL are in a life and death situation.  It's just like Bush with Katrina.  Basically at the beginning it was just read my lips.  Declaring a state of emergency , but not having anything on the standby ready to go
It is Gods way.  Now do you see how easy it is to become homeless?  People should care more for homelessness and do more for them.  Not just leave them out in the cold because it can happen to us by things like this that are out of mans control......But do humans ever learn to understand the simplicity of the message of the wrath!  When will this un equal world change?  Messages are loud and clear but nobody learns.......
Je vois ...
