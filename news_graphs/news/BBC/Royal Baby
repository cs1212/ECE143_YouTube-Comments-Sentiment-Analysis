I used to work in a Maternity theatre to see a grown man cry at the birth of his child is truely a humbling experience
Wow , you can see Prince Harry being a very good father in the future, along with Megan being a very good mother! Keep up the great work you two, and good luck!!!!
He’s also a dual American and British  citizen
He looked like his mom at points in this interview
Your mother must be watching from above she raied you with a commonality of good and decency congratulations
Congratulations!!! All the best to this family! :)
Ok... congrats. Thanks for the informal interview.
That little giddy-with-gladness bounce Harry does at 07 brought tears to someone's eyes. Weren't mine!
Congratulations to mum and dad. The birth of a baby gives birth to an experience that no one can describe.  Enjoy this incredible time together. ♥️
I’m so happy for them both! ☺️❤️
Down with the slags red nylon knickers and off with his head!
At about 1:01 you see a bit of chin wobble and teary eyes. I think he was not only choked up with happiness at the birth of his son, 
but also remembering his own
 beautiful Mummy who didn't live see her grandchild.
Prince harry got the horses in the back.
Thank you harry for appreciating all the mothers in the world. Some men take it for granted and it breaks my heart. Childbirth is the worst kind of pain anyone can imagine.  I am absolutely over the moon as a mum.
Congratulations 🎊
Grandma Diana would be so proud.
Poor bloke must be exhausted.
I heard he did a ten hour shift at Amazon just before the misses popped it out.
congrats from Kenya, E. Africa.
Congratulations to you and  your wife .

Famous people disappoint me, The very few that put a smile on my face, will Always be Diana's Good looking and graceful sons, this is why Diana is Loved so much, she wasn't just a Princess, but she was also a Great mother"! Humble people with a Big heart will Always be remembered and Loved, and when they die they become Legends, there story will always be told."
Unbelievable.
They live in a country where the police come over to check a person's thinking if they like a certain tweet and this is what's important?
Look I'm all for the best wishes when any couple welcomes a newborn.  And ceremonial institutions are the glue of a culture yada yada but this time its going to take more than obsession  over celebrities to halt the looming Orwellian darkness.
He looks so happy wow
Now there’s another thing DJANGO HORSE BEHIND HIM?
Good on ya prince Hewitt 😆 😆 😆

Congratulations to the sussex family you guys deserve it :-)
What a super ASSH-LE this cocaine sniffing, womanizer Harry is! Once a cheater always a cheater. As Meghan sparkle is a GOLD DIGGER these 2 lovebirds deserve each other
Yayyyyy!!!!
Congratulations!
CONGRATS
Harry is going to be such an amazing dad!! You can already tell by the way he is with kids, and he’s definitely inherited his mother’s kindness !!! 😍😍😍😍
Guess what Harry,I'm not remotely interested in you or your life or the people around you.If you want to invite television media into your life fine.I never would,not ever interested I'd probably bore you.Walk off at some point so never invite a television company into your private life unless your a royal.
Who describes their newborn son as an it and a thing? Proves my point the BRF are not human. Do your research on this lot, I can't believe how many stupid Brits we have fawning over them, they don't give a sh1t about us! Wake up sheep.
Happy new baby  boy
Congratulations
And Harry now knows His Bravest Action having been at His Wife's Side during His Sons Birth !
I would like to see him does he looks like Meg or Harry😊
One lucky boy came out ..
Name name name name??

Congratulations

I heard a surrogate actually delivered this child.
Une belle personne .... Le prince Harry. félicitations aux parents et bienvenue au baby royal
Wow wow wow

I have one year old boy. I was also thrilled by the experience. I know exactly what he means.
Not just a baby she shot a lion congratulations 🍾
Today's my birthday too haha
🥂❤️
👉👌 awww yeah
The question is: is this baby black or white? I’m not sure if 1/4 black = black. Then again, I didn’t think 1/2 black = black, but then there was Obama.

Omg who gives a shit really. The amount of babies born today and I am supposed to care about this one ?

Edward, Charles, William, George, something British I expect. Maybe Harrieta? As its genderless.
not arrogant
Congratulations 🎈🍾🎊! Delighted for you Harry and Meghan can’t wait to see him God bless you all !
Meanwhile on the streets of UK .. Child err n are going to bed hungry.. The homeless are dying.. Crime is way skyhigh.. the government telling lies to the public and gangstalking is on the rise

Meanwhile kids in the UK are queueing at food banks and have no pens at school
Congratulations Prince Harry and Dutches Megan!! ! You are both classy and remarkable individuals. Good luck 🍀 !
Who cares?
Congratulations
!!!!!
My suggestion  for his name Leroy Africana Windsor Leroy because Meghan is American, Africana  because  Meghan and Harry do lots of charity work in Africa and Windsor because its the royal last name.
Congratulations
He's so cute
He's sooo happy! But not happier than the Duchesse, I'm sure! My baby came a few days early and I thank her till this day! Congratulations to this amazing family! Hope the baby has red hair!!!
Been praying for Meghan so so happy for her she’s been through so so much ohh Congratulations on your new baby
This is so sad that there still racism in 2019!  I didn’t here anything bout surrogate when Diana or Kate appeared in full makeup and heels mire hour after giving birth. I could barely walk to the BR for a week after delivery!!
Is it anyone interest in the baby boy's name? Btw, is it allowed to talk about this here and now? I am sorry if I offended.
Lizard
Congratulations New baby boy Prince Harry  Wife
Are those horses behind Prince Harry a hidden hint that the just born Prince Harry´s  son´s real genetic grandfather is possibly Princess Diana´s lover cavalry officer James Hewitt, who has very similar face outlook than Prince Harry and even Prince Harry´s beard can´t hide it? Well, the just born son is anyway legally and officially a descendant of the von Hannover Saxe-Coburg und Gotha German origin Royal Family in the UK. Okey, they began to use the Windsor propaganda name during the WWI when they tried hide that they were during that time practically 100% German Royal Family ruling the UK and the UK and the British Empire were at war against the German Empire. Congratulations to the UK anyway from Northern Europe, from partly arctic Finland. Prince Harry got now with his first wife what King Henry VIII, who had once when he was a young man partly similar outlook than Prince Harry, so desperately once wanted with his six wives, lol. It is a boy and there is no need to reorganize and reform religious life or execute royal wives who aren´t fertile enough at this time in the UK.
Congrats Harry, you will be a great Dad
Congratulations God bless your family 😙😘
Lots of   love from Zimbabwe
congratulations !!! ...... sending love to all three of you xx...

A full publically-funded day of royal bumlicking from the bbc, ok so an insignificant baby was born into the royal family. Hardly warrants the full-on 24hr media coverage from the clowns of the media circus. Honk Honk!
Woohoo.. ..congratulation at new father. Smith

Congratulations Africa King

Dear, Harry... Please stop being so cute! <3

Congrats!! They’re going to be great parents ❤️
It's the surrogate  you should be thanking, NOT Megan !
Congratulations
Maybe his son is black
I'm sitting on my back porch in Santa Rosa California if anyone cares?!
😃❤😃❤
What is Camilla doing there?
Glad to hear that 🙂🤗 congratulations  to Duke  & Duchess  of Sussex god bless the little one❤😘😘
Gaaf.
They will divorce within five years and this thirty something American actress divorcée will be seen as the catalyst that brought down the royal family. Mark my words, this is historic for all the wrong reasons. As a former royalist, I couldn't care any less. They did nothing to stop this country turning in to the mess that it has become, in fact I would say they aided the destruction of Britain and the British people.
Lmao let’s get real, she had a surrogate.
Breaking news! A woman had a child! Crazy!
Why do people want to troll every nice comment anyone makes here??
Why the media obssessed with this soy boy and her old hag wife?
Congratulations to Royal family with lot's of love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Awesome - Congratulations Duke + Duchess Sussex -ENJOY baby Sussex.
James Hewit is a Grandpa.
Biggest Congratulations to you bouth Harry and Megan absolutely marvellous happy news.. I'm betting the Little Prince looks just as handsome as his father..✌😊 Warmest Congratulations to the hole Royal Family 💕💙💕
Comment what they should name the baby!
Mrtyu hojai sale ki.
They had a sweet little son!  Childbirth and children are amazing.  Congratulations and I can't wait to see him!
Ugly ginger bloke who never shaves and lasted 2 weeks in the army cos he missed his granny .money money money wife .
I bet baby is ginger
Una gran noticia para toda la humanidad.
CONGRATULATIONS FROM JAMAICA...ONE LOVE.
Delroy Winston Windsor is born. Shame it wasn't a girl, they could have named it Diane Abbott Windsor.
Congratulations to both of you, baby boy, great news Prince Harry.

Congratulations.  God bless 🙏🏾
One more freeloader taxpayers have to maintain for the rest of his life 😒😒😒
another disgusting oligarch lets all jump for joy.  pray that maybe this little boy will be the one to break this chain of evil.
Don't care 4 million kids in poverty in UK anyone on benefits has kids they ridiculed.royals are the biggest benefit recipients going
I dont understand 





How does the British monarchy help Britain?

Isn't the prime minister enough
Who cares
Who cares
Happy wishes
Don't care. Get us out of the EU ffs.
About time a little colour was added to the royal family just think 20 years ago this would of never of happened, congrats Harry
Laying.. Meghan faking pregnancy
The way he said it was absolutely lovely and so respectful.
Yay
How is the surrogate doing??😅😅
They should name their new son Edward Woodstock after the Black Prince who was England's most famous knight in the fourteenth century.
As a North American I have to ask something.
This is news 😂?
Another Lizard 🦎
Yeahhhhhh its a boy!👶👶👶👶
Awww!!!......Prince Harry Looks So Happy!!!......Congratulations to The Royal Family!!!
Lets hope the baby looks like a brother and not a white Michael Jackson lol. All those right wing nuts are gonna be crying in their beers lol
Aww this made me tear up a little!! So sweet
Good now expose the Royal family for same crimes, scandals & injustices as the Vatican coverup <<< BBC
I'm sure the baby will be fine if they don't change his sex in the next few years like they did with Dianna (David).

The royal family are just tourist attractions that look down on everything and everyone they are supposed to protect. They all should be stripped of their titles and wealth, to be made to live like the rest of us. They are just people, they are no better or above me and you.
Very happy for him but can’t stand Megan she’s terrible
Yes women are strong enough to bring our babies into this World. God bless .
Who cares.
Nobody cares.
I am glad for you, you will have such a grand time playing again.
Congrats 🤛🏼 no doubt the media are gonna be covering this is a negative light m, tryna criticism every little bit.
Another drain on the British taxpayers.
Just another one that will live off tax payers money. Big weddings.castles.flash hoildays its great.
future king of australia  his life has already been planned out
No one cares
Oh, he's SO happy and SO in love!   He'll be a great Dad - a fun Dad full of pranks and playfulness.  Congratulations to both of them and I can't wait to see the little man in a day or so.
Congratulations! Camilla looks happy on the background
Cuck.
Another mongrel for europe 🤦‍♂️
Little lizard child
Yay!!! Another baby prince. And just after louis first and charlotte fourth
Great another name to add to the "royal family", and I should care cuz?
Why not report on declining animal species/climate change instead, the future of the new baby might not be great
Does anyone actually care? 🤔
Damn this family to hell...
The prince should have little problem bringing up his baby in a normal manner and keeping the paparazzi away. That’s exactly what we did. We gave our child an ordinary state school education, further education and eventually university. We never let the paparazzi near her, and have had little or no problem with them at all. They were even polite enough to stay away when our daughter married,  and our granddaughter was born at our private home with no interference from the press whatsoever. In fact, when we asked the BBC if they would like to photograph the baby, they kindly said they couldn’t give a shit. See? Easy.
Hoorah 
Let the divorce proceedings begin
It's probably actually a girl but they feel like it's going to identify as a boy...
Is it black with red hair .
Prince Harry: we had a baby boy
LGBT Activists: you cant assign the gender without asking the baby.
J.K Rowling: Meghan was a lesbian all along!!
Long live the nationalist republic of Great Britain.
Hold the front page guys!! A baby was born.
He will have everything he needs since birth while others have to work 12hours a day just to survive
The Queen has got all of our money and has not protected her people.
Why do you keep banging on about her needing a cesarian when they never planned on having a natural birth in the first place. Typical bollocks from the BBC.
Biologically female but raising as male just like Hollywood
👨🏻‍🦰❤️👩🏽💙👶🏽
Congrats from Los Angeles 🏖🛣🎥🌅🏄🏽‍♀️☀️
Who is gonna pay for this gender neutral kid anyway? What a waste of taxpayers' money, such a disgrace. 
Anyway, what is Me-Again doing in the country. What happened to immigration entry protocol. Everyone else has to wait for years.
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN, TREAT HER WELL PROTECT HER FROM THE CRAZY ROYAL LIFE. SHE IS A GOOD PARTNER AND A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN BARBADOS.
Congrats to the both of them. Meghan is so gorgeous I bet the baby is too!!
Congratulations a million time and may God and all the good will of the whole world  good people prevail for ever and those evils of the her families and the lies sabres rattling eat their venomous dungs Hourrrrray to D Meghan and the gallant prince Hurry and the Queens and all Yapapppppa dabaaaaa dooioo Hourrrrrrrrrrrry to the good of all good peoples
Congratulation to the duke and duchess of Sussex
I thought it was gonna be gender neutral?
Why you telling us?  We won't raise   him y'know.
Grandad hewitt will be proud.
I haven’t been interested in the last 3 Royal babies...slow news day
What a sweet man he has become- he’s come so far from that trouble-making ginger I used to read about when I was a kid.
A BARBARIAN GIVEN BIRTH TO ANOTHER BARBARIAN LOL
Shame princess Diana got murdered by the queens orders and never got to see her grandchildren in her lifetime.
I’m sure James Hewitt is a very proud grandpa... I wonder if it’s got an Afro? #WelfareBaby
ginger tosser
Congrats, seems like history's gonna repeat itself,  his lineage will take the throne.  His brother and wife are kind of cold and unfriendly.  The queen adores Harry . She also loves and tends to  be very close to Megan to a point of cracking jokes with her..... 

Anyway congrats once again ANF may the almighty bless your beautiful family!!!!
Blessed are you and your Family among Royalties
As soon as I saw this I screamed from excitement we have all waited so long I’m so happy for the family
Bring out a nazi uniform to celebrate mate
I can't believe he is a father.  I still see him as a baby beautiful boy.  Now he is a man.  Henry, you have steped into fatherhood.  Welcome to the jungle.  Congs our son.
Congratulation is in order for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their bless arrival of their baby boy. May God continue to bless you all.
Might as well named him muhammad now since you wastes of spaces have let the invaders take over your country.
Soon enough they'll be coming for you & you will deserve it for not standing up for & protecting the people.
Name him Ramadan as he born in the beginning of the blessed month of Ramadan:)
Congratulations❤️❤️❤️
Talking to much and the horse behind looking confused
A woman gives birth - BBC "News"
"I don't know why any individual should care about these kind of stuff especially if it's from the very country that used to enslave our own but seeing as me being a reporter and it's my duty to report, I guess I'll just go ahead and "report"."

A real news report today from Sri Lanka.
So what, thousands of babies are born across the world everyday, why is his one anymore special?
Hope he’s let Grandpa James know 😉
Congratulations Duke and Duchess of Sussex for your first Royal baby boy! ❤❤❤
I wish you all the best Harry and Meghan with your beautiful bundle of joy!!! I only wish Diana was here to see how grown up her sons have become. She'd be so proud of her sons and ❤ both Kate and Meghan.😊
Mashallah! Born on the 1st day of Ramadhan.
Congratulations to you and your wife Sir. May the Almighty God preserve our New Prince and usher him to his original destiny.
His royal highness Prince Dindu !!!

Sooooooo who will get the throne?
Congratulations to this man he seems a really nice guy but can’t stand anything his family stand for! #Monarchy #Waste #Tax #Slaves

those royals make beautiful babies congrats harry and meghan bet the baby boy is a ginger like daddy 😀
How wonderful for them!  Harry is just adorable.
Parasite gives birth to another parasite (British monarch == head of state of arguably the most murderous Nation in the history of the world; Britain == murderer of Irish, Indians, indigenous Australians, native Americans, Kenyans, Malayans and much more recently, Northern Irish Catholics, Iraqis, Libyans, Syrians). It's an absolute pity so many people the world over (outside of the UK) fall for this propaganda propagated by this propaganda organisation.
Wakanda forever 🦍
Congratulations Duke and Duchess....So happy for you
🥰 Congratulations💕 Welcome to your wonderful world little one, it's lovely and wonderful to have you be a part of the changes ahead ⭐️🥰💕

I wonder if this baby will know anything of the water shortages predicted in 25yrs , probably not..   as the environmental brigade scream and shout we ignorantly keep increasing the population.   And it's a mongrel baby at that , you can hardly break out the union flag..
Had it been a girl her name would of been Theresa May. But it's a boy. Long live Prince Boris. x

I think it would be cool if they named him Spencer, it would be a huge 'nod' to Harry's mother.
Harry is so cool! Happy for him and his wife!! The best royal ever!!!
How totally Brilliant! I love harry and I'm so happy hes found Meghan and has his first baby and is so happy and clearly adores his family. Wish diana was here.....❤
Congratulations 🎉🎊✨ it's nice to have some good news for a change 🎈🎈🎉
🍁 CONGRATULATIONS from Canada!
I fail to see how this is considered news - thousands of children in the UK are living way below the breadline, thousands of children have been killed in Syria. Those children haven’t had nearly as much media coverage than this one pregnancy/baby has had and will have.
One more member of Robber Family
The way they were talking I thought she was going to have a 10+ pound baby.
Congrats Meghan and Harry! 
Beautiful Diana is looking down with a smile!

So many hateful low life  idiots are up and out attacking again. I really don't care about this couple but for the love of God  don't bully and insult a baby who is literally out in the world for less than 24hrs. Racist idiots are up and running the comment section 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Not another reptilian!🐍🤦‍♂️

Time to not watch the news - for about a week.
OMG I thought he said “baby’s a little bit of a Jew...” I was like COME AGAIN?! 🤣

Prince Harry is having royal sex I see
Now we iz Kangz!!!
Finally, His hard work gave him the result . . .
One more oppressor arrived
Leroy negro Windsor 🖕🏻
Oh who cares
Well done guys. 
During this pregnancy no-one was killed by kiilluminati secret service.
All nurses are alive and well.
On reflection i don't believe this baby was born today hence the secrecy this baby was born sometime ago and the photo release will be digitally altered she was pregnant before she got married the things the royal will do to save any embarrassment.
ARSENALL ARE GOING TO THE EUROPA LEAGUE FINALLLL
Turkey sent drilling and military ships inside Cyrpus' EEZ. The EU is not doing anything about it. It's obvious that when they talk about solidarity, they only mean solidarity to Germany. 

Remember, your problems, are your problems. But as Merkel said "Migration is not a German problem, it's a European problem. We should all show solidarity and accept the quota system and not leave Germany alone the carry the burden. European values are all about solidarity in crisis"

Unless you're not Germany. Then f*ck you!
Congrats to whole royal family.....and god bless the new born prince a gr8 health
Awww bless him so hard.
Congrats
What was the remark Harry made about the baby was to die for? I hope they don't murder their surrogate or the genetic scientists. Watch for a death list to emerge soon.
WHO GIVES A RATS ASSS
Congratulations!!
wtf
Wish your wife has a simple and easy delivery, and your son has a healthy life .
But BREAKING NEWS ? Wtf .
Heartbreaking to know the real reason she's had this baby with Harry and why she married him purely for self gain. 
Lowest of the low.
1 yab
another royal to waste of money
He's probably not going to see this but co congratulations Meghan and Harry!!!!
Congratulations 🇬🇧🇺🇸
Has he got a big knob?
who cares!
Another baby killer is born
We love you🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🙏the best news
It's official: twin horses
Congrats
Is he a black prince
I can't believe he is now a dad! If Diana could see him now she would have been so proud!
In so Happy for them!!!!!😣😙💙💙
He will one day become the Duke of Valhalla.
Call the baby William.  The most perfect name on earth
Anyone else disappointed?
That is one loud plane, ngl
Is it boy? Girl? Or another 60's or so?
Boring stop boring us with rubbish !!!
Captain James Hewitt must be so happy that he has a grandson ....think about it !!!
It's a boy, it's a girls, it's a unisex
I heard they're gonna call him Tyrone.
No one cares there irrelevant
She wasn't even pregnant. I bet the baby has red hair though
nothing like the birth of another slave owner being born, nothing like another lizard being hatched
Don't pay the TV tax.
who cares
His baby looks like 🦍🦍🦍
Congratulations from Northern Europe, from partly arctic Finland, to the UK. Cavalry officer James Hewitt got very possibly now a grandson, lol.
Congrats for a baby boy ❤
He must name the boy muhammad. Otherwise he is an islamophobe!!!!!
But wait...you live in the UK.  How do you know it is a boy.  How dare you impose your gender roles on that poor innocent child.  You are full of hate and should be sent directly to jail.
Yay
I thought he is ben stokes.
I wonder what they’ll call the baby? I hope they include Thomas as one of the middle names out of respect for her father. I think her father’s adorable.
Congratulations 👍
A ROYAL BABY Is UNAMERICAN and Its EVIL
I don’t get any of this ( im just a kid ) quote unquote
Harry is starting to look like a senescent elf
Congratulation!you are the real prince because you did not hasitate to marry a girl from black race.
Woh fith

Shame on UK government! How can you be a prince today while innocent people have become UK's political prisoners #FREEASSANGE

"And he is black, so we have to buy another baby; white by the way"... HRH Prince Henry
Who cares
🤦🏽‍♂️
Good evening, People all around the world. Serious warning. There is now a Brain Camera use by wicked men all around the world for practical joke, murder, & spying anybody's life.

Your brain is like on a computer magnetic field. Procedure if somebody or many people camera your brain... If you hear somebody or many voices are talking to you inside your head.. You're not crazy. Somebody or many people connected their brain to your brain through secret high tech device from afar. Step 1, Never never talk to them inside your mind. Step 2, don't be afraid & ignore their practical joke inside your mind. Step 3, Never never show your entire personal thought & your entire private life to them from their Brain Camera. But still they'll see your other thoughts, imagination, nakedness of your body, & work of your body because all of it are connected to your brain. They'll arrogantly scare you, practical joke you, & disrespect your entire inner being & your entire private personal life. They'll also kill you. They're Mischievous Jokers & Murderous Spies. It's really Scary & Dangerous. Call & run speedily to your family & friends then call & run speedily to the Police & to your FBI counterpart into your country. The Brain Camera is also dangerous to the condition & health of your brain. If there's a hifden physical camera for practical joke, murder, & spying anybody's life. There's also a hidden Brain Camera just like that. Beware of anyone. Anyone is a user & anyone is a victim. Brain Camera is already been bought by many secret buyers all around the world. This is buy & sell secretly all around the world. Every Brain Camera & every kind of it are purely Evil, Crime Against Humanity, Privacy Theft, Evil Spying, at Prime Threat to entire Privacy & Life of everybody all around the world. Book of Daniel, Many Shall Run & Fro & Knowledge/Intelligence Of Mankind Shall Increased in time of the end, which is our time. Book of Matthew & Luke, For Nothing Is Covered That Will Not Be Reveal Nor Hidden That Will Not Be Known. What I Tell You In The Dark. Say In The Light. Whatever You Hear Whisper In Private Rooms. Proclaim On Housetops. I'll pray the Lord of hosts in heaven will punish every wicked user of this secret device, He expose the entire Brain Camera & every kind of it, He expose the entire Secret Technological Corporation, He expose the entire Secret Shop, & He expose the entire Secret Conspiracy & Inside Job of every wicked people all around the world. Government including big politicians, public agencies, etc... Non Government including private organization, private companies, etc... Warning. The wicked users are anyone. They are very wise & vigilant. Be Wise, Vigilant, & Prayerful to God always. Pray first before asking help & anything else. Pray first always.
Born on Ramadan 1st. 
The baby should be named uthman bin Mohammed III.
That duznt look like the real Harry did anybody else c him shapeshift at the beginning and the horse reacted at exact same time?? Watch n u will c! These ppl ( demon/reptilians) make me sick and their sick agendas with their gender fluid child how sick well that's the Royals fur ye init!
Give it 18 years or so the next gen mk3 apache gunship pilot like father like son. Well do to the both of you.
Thank goodness Meghan does not have to hold her tummy anymore lol
Congratulations Your Royal Highness
Congrats to Harry and Megan...
Congrats you guys are so deserving and wonderful human being!
Congratulations
A BABY BOY......?
HOW DO THEY KNOW...?
THE BABY IS GENDER NEUTRAL...?
"THEY" COULD BE TRANSGENDER ...?
THIS STATEMENT IS SO CIS BIASED...?
"WE HAVE HAD A BABY" WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE.❤️.
BEST WISHES.
😍
Congratulations to your family💙👶
Now there’s a thing I can’t wait for uppity django get on that horse and ride up to candy land and rescue Megan markle ?
Congratulations Harry!!!
Wow, I've witness a white UK Prince give birth to a black man!! YES, I means 'give birth" and "black man" I wonder do the birth certificate reads...African American, African UK, or white?
😂😂BBC news so
Are they going to name it Mandingo?   Heard it looks like Nipsy Hustle.
A black "prince".....What an abomination. I'm sure generations of Kings are rolling in their graves. I'm glad Diana didn't get to see this atrocity.
So adorable.
I'm crying happily 😄😄😄
Prince Harry announces....
thats quick
Finally, His hard work gave him the result . . .
One more oppressor arrived
Baby boy 👦 😍
I like that that he said 'baby boy' like there also could have been 'adult woman'
Very happy for both of you.
A baby boy? Congratulations! and well done to the Queen for slapping that gender neutral crap out their heads
Another brat for the tax payer to fund
The baby boy of Prince Harry is mixed race!Viva the little son of the late beautiful princess Diana!
I wonder if it looks black, Megan’s dad was white, now Harry is white. That’s the only interest I have in this lmao, seeing what it looks like.
Race mixing is degeneracy. A crime against the eco-system.
The Royal Family and the majority of world leaders have repeatedly downed media and news organizations for intruding on their privacy. So,okay ,they don't want the attention, DON'T GIVE IT TO THEM.ANY OF THEM INCLUDING AMERICAN POLITICS. JUST SAY "WE COULD CARE LESS WHAT YOU TWEET, INSTAGRAM, PHOTOGRAPH , NO COVERAGE WHAT SO EVER.
  Harry's wife has caused a riff from day one. It's obvious she has driven a wedge between the Brothers. She's a pure dramaqueen,all about her. She sure was huge to have such a little baby. I'm like a previous comment or,Mabe she can STOP hugging her belly like she's been the MaDonna With Child.
     If you shun the media at his birth then WHY even make this statement to the press???? You can't have it both ways Sussex . And ,no,I don't think his Mom would be very proud of his choice,she would have put the actress in her place long ago. 
To many movie star/celebraty interference. Here again Attention: A$250,000.00 baby shower??????? When children are starving. Shame on you Tennis Star ,Shame on you Oprah ,and all who so hypocritically participated in such a farce. Sick.
What are the responsibilities of prince according to British Constitution?? Enjoy life or born babies or something else ??? By the way prince Harry is a gay so ,why he married ???
OH MAH GOD CAN I THROW IT OFF BUCKINGHAM PALACE
Puke
