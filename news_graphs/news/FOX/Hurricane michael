I can't believe anyone would talk about climate change at a time like this. It's so obvious the Deep State is responsible for Michael and Florence. Only an idiot would fall for something as stupid as science.
Weather is not political!
This is the same dude that said, "and your kids die to!" When he was talking about hurricane Matthew
This isnt Florida‚Äôs first rodeo
Stay safe!!!
Global warming is a hoax! It is not flooding in Texas.
Florence: take this stupid east coast..



Michael: REEE IM GOING FOR SOUTH COAST {I live in the east coast please support this comment by likening :(}
This is a liberal hoax. This isn't happening.  Everything is perfect. The climate is fine.
May those blue states be off the map.

Yeah but climate change isn't real or anything right
God plz protect
Why does it say catagory but on cnn it say catagory 5
I wonder what the waffle House Index is
Damnit
Poor folks
Well it depends on what you mean by a hurricane. In the time before modern science people conceived of things in supernatural terms, infused into every day life!  That's no joke! There were no hurricanes, only acts of God. But it's more like a Goddess - the personification of a wild and destructive feminine archetype, much like the recent Ford-Kavenaugh debacle. At least, well, that's for starters.
The 175 mile wind gust will surly surpass that wind bag Maxin Waters mouth can produce.
It's a good thing global warming ain't real and warmer big wet ocean water doesn't fuel hurricanes.
Living on a generator and candles fridge raider plugged in and Wi-Fi trying to stay safe in St. Petersburg Florida no power whoever gets this hi everyone is on the communication I have right now

Please get Shepard Smith out in the storm to report. He is the only reason I would stop watching FOX news as we do not need Democrats at FOX new network.
My friend got in the hurricane. She‚Äôs not responding to my messages
The storm went from a Category 2 to a Category 4 as it was "supercharged by abnormally warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico". But all good, climate change is a hoax. 
To deny climate change at this point is to deny all of reality itself. We threaten future generations-- our sons and daughters -- everyday we do not seriously address this with the urgency and haste it requires.
Where tf did this come from?
We can barely feel it here in Orlando because I went to the Aquatica today across from SeaWorld and then the sun came out a couple times but mostly it was just cloudy
Mexico beach? You mean the Gulf of Mexico smh
We need to stop hurricanes
No god please no
Chupa pi**
We need hurricane Jesus
THE WEATHER AINT GOT NO NAME WHERE YOU THINK HURRICANE MICHEAL FROM???? HMMM
omgfg:-(
Oh nooo I‚Äôve been learning about Michael !!! In school.
So a cat 4 hurricane and I live in Florida YET SOMEHOW ITS MADE LANDFALL AND SCHOOL WAS STILL OPEN I live in the middle but cmon wth I never even know there was a hurricane coming he‚Äôll my school barley mentioned it
If this hit New Orleans there would no longer be a New Orleans to go back to for a VerY long time. 1 agree or 2 disagree.

Fake news!
Trillions and billions and dollars somewhere on Florida and Panama City that some of you that you heard that is Panama City is Florida right there not Panama but Panama City in Florida don't get confused just looking in Google map anyway and one more thing this is going to be the biggest expensive money for the for the cover that people lost their homes property and business no seriously half of Americans are 50 states had to surrender of the money what day are saving and then tried to expense of Florida so what's the hurricane just passed away and how much is going to be expensive that to rebuild again en Florida Florida that everyone Florida so this is how you call recover of everything of stuff and try to expense more and one more thing the people that I'm saving all this piggy Bank to have to spend damaged property and business to Florida or anywhere so this is how it goes working business okay

STOP EATING ANIMALS. MOTHER NATURE NEVER FORGETS
Fake news!!!
Hi
Why hello
FAKE NEWS
And where is Trump?   
He is out telling his election stories again like your crazy uncle who never forgot his high school football games.
I guess he forgot he LOST by 3 million votes and his buddy Brett has 51% of Americans wanting him NOT to be on the Supreme Court.  He also seems to like his new catch phrase 'mob' to describe anyone who dos not worship him.
I think it's Karma that Republican states are the most affected by Hurricanes. It's also Ironic because they don't believe in Climate Change.
My sister "katrina" and now my father "michael". My family sure does hate florida.
How did a hurricane bring forth political debate? Yeesh, I‚Äôm only here to study it.
I have an app that I use to track hurricane Michael
Pulling out of international agreements doesn't look too appealing now does it?
hi michael
God angry
I blame hillary clinton
that the hurricane takes Trump
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaüò≤üò±
This suit wearing news deuch wouldn't know what an eye wall was unless his eye got slammed into a wall...deushbag eyewall slam... Ilmfao
Well I'm so close to it I'm in America and it is scary
For the people that live in Florida and Panama City please try to me cover of your stuff and everything business and small stores and even lost property right there so this is only just a message for people in Florida that's it only for the people in Florida that's it. If you don't live in Florida move on in this message is going to be the people in Florida that live in the danger zone that's it
Sooo i like fox but i don‚Äôt like hurricanes... I‚Äôm not sure if i should give the video a thumbs up... ... ... decisions......
My friend jaylen is going there with his grand mom
GOD BLESS SHEPARD SMITH.
Yeah people over there are gonna get screwed get over it
Shep, idiot, landfall isn‚Äôt when the outer eyewall comes ashore.  It‚Äôs when the middle of the rotation comes ashore.  You‚Äôre a reporter?

This is really bad my cousin told me his dad is near the storm I hope he‚Äôs safe
This is why i hate the name Michael
I'm sorry but don't come to Tennessee
Remember last year when all the media idiots were in Ft. Lauderdale and Miami supposedly it cover when Irma hit? And Irma roared up the West coast right through Naples instead? Best if they all stay in NYC safe and sound where they at least won't get in the way of people actually working to help deal with the storm.
Oh well.  They're only Americans and the Trumptards don't care about us.  So happy rooftop surfing!

Don‚Äôt worry! Trump will throw you a roll of paper towels. He said the storm will be very very wet.
Michael, the Archangel, is punishing those who support the lying, cheating, adulterous Trump.  Repent of your sins, you in the southern Trump states.  Worse could yet happen to you!
worse yet ,i thought you would try abc or any alphabet news network since you continue to upset your viewers

Expected Shep to be on location. He knows storms. Good source for accurate level headed reports.
123 MISSING children have been found in Minnesota. Check abc7. There is other important news apart from Trump dementia.
This why I detest religeon, you guys only judge him for being gay, he tells the truth so you use his love life to degrade him. Very sick guys.
Whole bunch of Trump voters are getting all washed up now, GOOD!
Why is this hurricane called Michael?  Why don‚Äôt we call it Robert, after Robert Murray, the coal baron who tells Trump what his energy policy is going to be?  Or we could name future hurricanes after members of Mr Murray‚Äôs family, or the Trump family.  I think the next one should be Hurricane Baron.
EXCELLENT NEWS... two conservatives states whacked in two weeks.. It's called climate change KARMA
Godamn you trump will you just stop it‚Äôs time to stop I swear this man will not stop making big storms him and Russia back at it
