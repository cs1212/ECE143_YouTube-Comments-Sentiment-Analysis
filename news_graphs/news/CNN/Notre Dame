Whatever your views on religion, this is a tragedy. This wasn't just a church, it was a work of art that took 200 years to build. I always wanted to visit it, and now I'll never get the chance. Such a shame...The important thing, I suppose, is it doesn't seem that anyone has been hurt in this. I hope that remains to be the case.
I took for granted every time I visited this church in Assasin’s Creed Unity.
Why is Friday the 13th unlucky?
April 15th is unlucky
Abraham Lincoln was shot
Titanic sank
And now Notre Dame
This is so devastating to watch 😟 I'll never be able to see it personally the same as it was on pictures shown in our history of architecture subject... Heartbreaking 😢
As a lover of history this breaks my heart
I can't even watch. This so heartbreaking.
My heart goes out to France♥️🙏🏼 That's really sad. A cultural historic place gone. 🙁
Okay folks...... the church of the world is set on fire during holy week.... they said they found no signs of arson....... mmmmmmm. Wha....
Almighty God , please bless this cathedral to recover and give hope who tries to repair Notre Dame Cathedral🙏
It will not be the same even if rebuilt. They made this in 1100’s !! This is devastating
It's not only a building burning, it's history. More tragic is it in the Holy week too.
absolute heart ache!  tragic 
mal au cœur absolu! tragique ! 
 Heart and soul weep access terrible Loss.
Le coeur et l’âme pleurent une terrible perte.
Stay stong, França! From Brazil 🇫🇷🇧🇷
This is so sad! SO much history just got burnt to the ground. 2019 is going to be in history books... Think about that.
damn such a tragic thing happened and this madlad dabbing in the background 1:06
Sad watching history be destroyed so much history gone
Very sad I myself have been to this beautiful church
Oof! I'm an Atheist but this is truly a sad day. Took 200 years of hard work to build something beutiful but got destroyed in a night.
People shouldn’t have been crowding around, it prevents rescue teams from getting there
Media is fast blaming it on a renovation accident Meanwhile alot of churches in France has been vandalized 🤔
It‘s the place where I met my wife...Looking at this just breaks my heart
God bless you all in France. Love from the USA
I'm just glad it didn't burn the whole cathedral but still what a loss of an iconic structure.
Prayers for Notre Dame

Love to France from the Philippines
Notre Dame is just as, if not more iconic than the Eiffel Tower.
Man, I was there 2 years ago. Beautiful architecture, shame it fell. But it CAN be rebuilt.
🇫🇷 💜 🇫🇷 💜 🇫🇷 💜
Norte Dame is in my thoughts.
With love from 🇩🇪
Vive la France  🇫🇷
The spire was a monument of history. A representation of some of humanities greatest accomplishments. This is truly heartbreaking.
I mourn the loss of the Loss of the Notre Dame. I experienced one of the highlights of my lifetime there when an American choir who recorded a hym with special permission from the priesthood in this cathedral. The harmony of the song with the acoustic of the cathedral was FANTASTIC
Disney's live-actions remake game strong bruh
It has been about 1000 years and today, we lost it.
Love from USA 🇺🇸 god bless are ally France 🇫🇷 all of USA wishes them luck even Trump
Wow what the hell? Time goes by so fast. It feels like it happened 2 weeks ago
0:45-0:48 lol that guy tho
Strengthen the security around the Louvre please.
seeing the tower fall actually made me cry, all that history gone like that I actually can't believe this ....
Omg it’s on spire 😭😩🥺
This is heartbreaking.  My thoughts are with the population of France.  Such a beautiful building.
This is described as "one scene of collapsed Europe" in the later world
The anchor looks more like Angela from The Office.
Literally a week ago I was on a school trip there. I never thought that I could be thrilled and amazed by a building. Notre Dame proved me wrong. So much history behind it. It's devasting to watch. Thank God no one is injured. From your greek brothers. Reste forte.🇫🇷

If a person caused this they shoud get consequences for destroying something that lasted for almost 1000 years
What a loss
Going to take another couple of decades to build another one but there will never be the same.
Nothing can be the exact same when it is rebuilt
Can you imagine being the tradesman, with a grinder perhaps, whos sparked this fire.

Condolences from Poland ♥️ So sad it's happening this Holy Week.. ✝️

Support for France from Orthodox Serbia! You will need God in times to come, more than ever! We all will.
I am Indian Catholic 
My prayers are the people of France , This is a humble loss , 😢😢😢😢
You know whats weird,when i woke up this morning i rememberd a song that i used to lisened to, its called sirens over Paris,What a coinsidense.
Looking forward to finding out how the fire started.
Seigneur, en plein début de semaine Sainte, vraiment très triste
Everyone: Oh my god no
Me: HELLFIREEEE!
Let’s hope that most of what was lost can be restored and what what can’t be restored and what can’t be restored has been photographed or digitally archived. It is a tragic cultural, religious and historic loss but we will be able to rebuild large amounts of it. It won’t be the same by any stretch but whether intentional or accidental it will comeback
Glad to know that all the relics and treasures were moved away prior to renovations.
Profonde tristesse from Italy😢❤️🙏

Well. At least I'd recommend that scaffolding company. Once up stays up!
Burn baby, burn! Disco inferno!
Exciting good news！！！！People spoke of the Parthenon in Greece, the pyramids in Egypt, the Coliseum in Rome, Notre-Dame in Paris, the Summer Palace in the Orient.One day two bandits entered the Summer Palace.One plundered, the other burnedVictory can be a thieving woman, or so it seems.
The devastation of the Summer Palace was accomplished by the two victors acting jointly.Before history, one of the two bandits will be called France; the other will be called England.
                                   ——VictorHugo
This was one of the few places in life I actually wanted to travel to just because it’s so amazing and beautiful, my prayers go out to the people of France, stay safe everyone.

Love from Greece 🇬🇷❤️🇨🇵
how could be this happen OMG...
It's so sad that a structure that historic and beautiful is breaking because of the fires😭😭😢😢
Yikes, that's quite a shame.
Managed to survive everything from the Middle ages, multiple French Revolutions and even two World Wars. Quite a shame indeed. I hope they manage to get the fire out.
this is soo sad...
This is a loss to the world.
heartbreaking ,so bad
Thank you LOONA :(( ♡♡
Is leaving:
- a simbol of Paris
- a heritage for umanity
- a source of inspiration for musical and cartoons.


Another piece of history is going and this so sad....

This reminds me of a card from that illuminati boardgame
I’ve been there before, it’s amazing 😭😭😢why!
the ashes raining upon paris from the wood of the cathedral are more than 600 years old... think about that
My heart sank seeing this.
This is so devastating... I've always wanted to visit paris and especially Notre dame cathedral. My favorite disney movie is the hunchback of Notre dame. It's so sad that I never got the chance to see its beauty before this catastrophe😔😞
I'm dissappointed in myself. First thing I thought of was, of course, how devastating it was. Then right after that I screamed "QUASIMODO NO." 

Smh.
That is quite shocking.
One of the greatest works of Christian and European culture ever constructed. Absolutely heartbreaking to see. I lived in Paris for a year and I can only offer my sincere condolences to the French people and to Parisians in particular. As a Londoner I know how horrific it is to see something like this happen to a building that is like an old friend or a member of your family. St Paul's Cathedral is a symbol of the entire British nation and a symbol of our great city. France will rebuild its magnificent cathedral. Everyone around the world who loves art and history and culture sends you their prayers and support. Rebuild! Paris, Je t'aime.
Sad.  No doubt the lefties will blame Trump.
Paris Fire Department has super power. it already determent it is accident when it still burning.

Saddest moment in paris

I can’t imagine how devastating this must be...
Stand strong France! 
Love from the UK 🇬🇧
Good thing I went there before
The US grieves with you France. Vive la France! Vive liberté
Lmao that was brilliant shame nothing else collapsed as cool as that did...
I can feel the agony of my art history teacher..
Notre dame will rebuild.
Now collect worldwide.....
Many things are saved. 
Notre dame? 🤛💪❤
And Disney donated $$ too. Good. Finally Disney princesses can be painted on the stain glass windows.
I am overwhelmed with grief. I have been to the Cathedral two times. It inspired me with Divine respect for Western civilization both times. Love to all of France!!!
So sad for France 🇫🇷😭
Not many people go to church these days
Think we all know who's responsible for this,but feelings.
Jesus's late April fools
I live near this church
What a tragedy! 
Heartbraking... :/ :,(
This is what happen when you ban meme... i shall take note for the future
I hope it gets rebuilt, if possible
Je suis Notre-Dame
Horses of the night run slow.
Spain is with you during these difficult moments Paris, we know that beautiful cathedral will rise again one day. Stay strong our brothers and sisters. 🇨🇵
I wish I could've seen this building in person, even if I'm not Catholic I'd still absolutely love seeing it.
Alexa play Hellfire from the Hunchback of Notre Dame
1163 was  Christ alive
This was prophesized
Je suis français et je suis vraiment triste 😭🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷aller la France !!
Sanctuary no more.....
Notre D.'s black Madonna is really SOULESS Sophia who created SOULESS Yahweh. The huge embarrassment to France is gone.
Sophia is the a.i. for the earth simulation. Break your contracts with a.i. religions. Earth lets unbuild every a.i. church.
I built one of these in Civ 5 once
Blood hell, it still hard for it to sink in! Sad.
So sad... Was there summer 2017 and saw this magnificent piece of history. 
Might sound like a dumb question, but shouldn't sprinklers have been installed long time ago in such a historical valuable building..?
Who's idea was it to play my mixtape in there?
People are forgetful.   There was a fire in Brasil just a few months ago and ruined their national museum completely.  The cathedral authority should have thought of this and taken the precaution.
No way this was an accident.I bet the fire inspecter who diagnosed how the fire started is part of the elite as well
How did it start burning?! I remember being there in 2017 on holiday, it was so beautiful... Love and support from the Netherlands ♡
Oof! It’s an AP4 prompt it’s a metaphor!
I wish these CNN reporters would speak in a more calm and informative tone. Reporting voices like these border on the hysterical. BBC seem to have it right.
Really so sad.. from Srilanka
All nations who are giving jobs to immigrants instead of local citizens will lose their heritage and their self respect going up in fires like these.
People are cheering!
Monseigneur Frollo's ghost was laughing in the flame. He got his Infernal finally.
How it happened???
I am absolutely devastated. Such a magnificent piece of culture, the very best of gothic cathedrals, burning to the ground...I'm in tears. When I heard about the Notre Dame fire, I thought it was a minor thing...
My thoughts are with Paris and prayers hoping they extinguish the fire soon. Years of history lost. Yet making a new sad moment in history.
On Holy Week
TIMBER !!!!
Never got to see it :(
Ninja did what in europe?!
Today will also be marked in history Thank god no one died

Have a wonderful day and night everyone. Sad times :(
Took over 200 years to build and its been over 800 years that structures been with us
My heart broke again today.
The devil is one uo on us.
thank  god is over now. i hope they can re-build the lost parts again.
Love from Portugal <3
It doesn't matter if you're religious or not, that cathedral was of great cultural and historical significance, and it was a symbol of France. Now its gone.
The half hour line was worth it last year.
Paris your in our prayers 🇫🇷🇺🇸

We've been there last February so sad news😢
What the hell ninja
People keep saying I'll be rebuilt/fixed. Yes it will but it won't be the same because it was built so long ago. It has so much history. How many people touched the exact walls that got burned. Not only that the fire burned the building,but also the people that were there years ago.
Sad. A very big loss.
So so sad!! Huge condolences and thoughts to the french people tonight. Lots of love from Wales. Nous sommes Avec toi.🇫🇷🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Omg no from PUERTO RICO
watch naughty beaver channel the holly grail video you will get the truth
I was there 🤧😓🥺😢😭😱😱😱
It was legendary 💔
The tears just keep pouring out nonstop from my eyes. My heart is just shattered. Notre Dame is beyond religion or nationality. It speaks to something deep in the soul that is universal.  Beyond words.  All of that human inspiration and hundreds of years of effort up in flames in hours.  I hope this will awaken the best within us moving forward. Love and prayers to Paris, the firefighters and the people there.
Heartbreaking to watch 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔
A philipino in England is praying for you 🙏🙏🙏
Atleast all of your precious things are now safe
❤❤❤💖💖💖💕💕💕💓💓💓💟💟💟💞💞💞💝💝💝💘💘💘💗💗💗

It's a stunning building, let's hope they can restore it as quickly as possible. And to its finest glory .
I hope their okay

Isn’t this exactly what happened in “The Hunchback of Norte Dame”? I remember lots of fire. Originally built in the 1100’s this is going to be quite a loss.
Am deeply saddened by this turn of events aging back to the 12th century.
CNN..didn’t Trump cause this as well as global warming ?
1:06 look at the guy in the right

A horrid day. In disbelief. Like a relative being murdered.
This is sad 😥
My prayers are with the people of France, this is a horrible loss, and I pray that nobody is hurt.
CNN LOVES THIS
0:45 dude is so funny
The last vestiges of Christianity collapsing in Europe one after another.

Here's something cnn doesn't tell you,... look it up for yourself how many churches have been burned in the past 4 years in France?
How many desacrated?
How many compared to the previous 4 years?
When did the "migrants" become welcome to France?
Think for yourself people before it's too late. Know what side your on before your own heads are taken. God blessed the USA so act like it.

hahhaha the guy at 0:44
This is horrible... so much history in flames
This is very sad to lose the history of it, now we can only see it through the book and internet. Even for a Muslim like me seeing this breaking my heart, to see a place that part of people memories goes down is draining my emotions. I wish they can rebuilt it don't give up when everything is possible. Sending love and big respect from Indonesia for France 🙏
Feels very 911, that white smoke
Took me so long to build that on civ
This is funny
Riots, civil unrest, fires and now one of the most beautiful buildings gone.... paris has really had a bad year I hope the city can recover from all of this
Makes me think of Ken Folletts Pillars of the Earth, when villages were built around the building of the churches where all the craft people came together, no doubt it could be re built but will they find the crafts men to carry out the intricate work of yesterday. I feel very sad.
Here’s a question: How did it catch fire?
WTF..FLAMMABLE SCAFFOLDING   ??????????????????????..
HELLFIRE!
This is so sad, I was there 4 years ago and The Cathedral was awe inspiring, and I'm not religious;  A loss of such History.
How can they be so sure it is not terror as I heard on one media source ?
I remember my first visit there .it is an amazing structure and this is indeed a great loss .
y a-t-il quelqu'un ici français? si donc que pensez-vous de notre dame? Pensez-vous qu'ils devraient reconstruire notre Dame à nouveau?
I send my prayers out to France as I pray that France can rebuild and that the crown of thorns is ok
Why are people sad?
Were can I send money
The Notre Dame's construction took dozens of years, I hope it is repaired and restored soon :"( 
(Sorry for my bad English)
Sad  very sad
Что имеем не храним, потерявши плачем
Mon coeur est avec tous les  Français. Hoje chorei de tristeza. Portugal est avec vous!
So sad
Honestly so sad
I'm so sorry for us losing this !:( :(
This is absolutely horrific, I cried when i saw the spire fell
So sad ... before 3 years when I was 17 I was with my class in France and we visited Notre Dame it was incredble...now it is burned...🙏🙏😟
zut alors!
So when my house burnt down,an my insurance somehow wasnt kickin in,,,noone helped me,,not a hand ,a shoulder to cry on,or a dime,,,donations are coming in to replace the structure,,,what im hearing is a structure is more important than human life,,,
They predicted this years ago. Its all a set up. Watch my pet goat 2 on youtube.
thoughts and prayers from the USA! God will help you!
1:08 guy wearing clouts hits an old meme
I find it hard to believe the structure wasn’t  protected by a sprinkler system.
Top Fire Disasters



1:The  CA Camp Fire

2:Notre Dame



Edit: How About 9/11
How did it burn up so quick? This is one of the most historical monuments on earth? Its as if they waited 2 hours to fight the fire.
When it comes crashing down and it hurts inside!!!!
I am so damn sad. Why.
This is a place where two Gods are worshipped - The God of Heaven and Earth, and the French themselves.

So it is written that you cannot serve two masters which may be the very reason the Lord allowed its part destruction.
They will build a greater spire now. Need them 3-3 broods.
Some people did something.
This is painful.
SHARIA LAW NO DOUBT MUSLIM LAW. 911 NO DOUBT SOMEONE DID IT
Where was air support with water 😑 Meh French 🤣
OMG I was shocked knowing that. Been there back in 2016. An amazing structure has been destroyed. It’s just sad.
800 years... Couldn’t you give us more?
Notre Dame;  our lady.
Merci  pour votre soutien  🇫🇷
Those Frenchmen were slow and un-prepared. In California: 4 Firefighter Helicopters will put that away in minutes...
Just imagine being the person known for burning down the Notre Dame Cathedral. RIP
Like fire, hell fire
This is unbelieveble a history burned incredible i shocked at night
Love from Mexico. I have very nice memories from Notre Dame when I visited Paris.
This is so heartbreaking. I remember seeing this beautiful cathedral many years ago. I thought its beauty was everlasting. I am so sorry that this has happened to this Wonderful piece of art and history.
Prayers out from USA. Hurts to see history destroyed like that
It’s sad that it will never be the same like think of this it was built 800 years ago but we will try
God bless us. forgive the sinners..
pet goat 2 revels the truth of the fire amen just watch naughty beavers channel you will get the real truth of whats to come welcome to the real world all planned
Oh no... I can’t describe how horrible I feel about the loss of this huge chunk of history. It was such a symbol of religion and patriotism to France. 

Respect from the USA 🇺🇸
I have visited the site years ago. What a terrible loss of a historic monument. My condolences to the French people and to the city of Paris.
Someone had to of set the notre dame on fire on purpose
Macron said on TV that he is asking the EU 27 States to contribute to the Restoration of the Hunchback better than  before he said  so why not employ all the craftsmen from the 27 States that way the investment is more than money it's people power for the Union ,just saying ?!
They’ve said it hasn’t been totally destroyed. It’s so sad, but we will come together & rebuild.
kind of pitiful .but really remind of the unparrelled palaces you invaders burnt up in China in 19th century.What about you guys
What an incredible shame, its stood for 850 years, don't believe what I am seeing
Perhaps
It is under renovation sadly it was burn an accident who's to blame now carelessness that was
Guess that burnt down quicker than Yuanmingyuan圆明园, eh? What goes around ... Comes around
Well Damn!!! The famous Notre Dame is no more I guess
Amidst all the chaos, I can't imagine how philippe petit must be feeling.
He walked across the twin towers and Notre Dame, and now both of them have been destroyed.
Also, hellfire .
About 10 years ago, the no.1 national treasure of my country was lost in a fire. Reminds me of the sadness that i felt at that time.
France is my favorite country im so sorry for u guys that’s terrible it was my wish to see this beautiful cathedral when I grow up and travel to France 🇫🇷💔❤️
Big oof
dammit sonic
National Museum (BRAZIL - RIO DE JANEIRO), Notre Dame Cathedral (FRANCE - PARIS) on fire. History turned into ashes in few minutes. So sad and unacceptable!!
orange man's fault
Great footage.  This is so sad and devastating. I understand it was built in 1100?  How will they ever recover from this; all of the artifacts, gone?
My husband has an wonderful idea how to put out fires. Dropping 2500 pound bags of water like a water ballons on huge fires.
1:06 my boy dabbed
I, Pet 🐐 II
this is all trumps fault!
Wow, what a tragic situation, but not as tragic as Trump not knowing the cathedral was an actual place, the idiot called Disney to give his condolences.
Old building"done its time.termites got at it
It was made 1,000 years ago, half of Jesus’s crown was there and the cross, and king and queens were born there along time ago 😢
here comes the doomsday apocalypse theorist
We are very happy to see this fire accident  😀 Voices from China
Really sorry    Tragedy
Been to Paris 2 times, and never visited the Notre Dame, i always thought to leave some places unvisited, so it will give me reasons to come back, and now this.......so so sad. Hugs from Indonesia.
Construction accident? Yea right.
i know this is serious but the  guy at 1:05 is a legend
Does anyone know what started the fire?
Its sad...but at least we know Viseron from last night was here 😳
Im not religous at all im actually a nihilist but this depresses me to see so much history gone at the blink of an eye
How can it be too expensive to rebuild? People originaly built it in 1345, surely back then it was much harder to build it than now. Therefore, it was even more expensive back then... Surely 2019 has better standards and technology and more money than 1345, right?
Tell Jesus I have three nails so I can put him up for the night...
I don’t see the horror, she’s exaggerating
Lefties are happy, but to humble to show it.
Terrible tragedy! Such a lovely old place! 
  Prayers to the Parisians! God bless you all!🕊
 I do hope they can put the fire out quickly and safely!
I just left Paris last night!
So heartbreaking 😢😢😢Respect from 🇷🇸 friends!
I watching these people and I don't see their tears. I just see: "Wow, it's interesting" no any sorrow or criyng at all
This is so sad. It actually made me cry. As a Greek, I feel like this is as if the Parthenon was set on fire. Hope there will be a possibility to be rebuilt.
안타깝 ㅠ 빨리 진화하길 🥺
A week before Easter.. 😭😭😭 I don’t even care about Easter THIS WAS OUR WORLD BURNT TO PEICES WHAT IS IT TRYING TO SAY
Where's Ladybug & Cat Noir when you really need them!
For whole “civilized” world it's a real tragedy. But how this “civilized” world react to a requiem concert in destroyed Palmyra?
Now I will never see the beautiful building
Easter begun
Quasimodo's home distroied. :'-(
This is soo heartbreaking 😢😢😢in June was to go visit there sad indeed
What?
Lol as if Paris couldn't get anymore messed up
It was burned by Macron's masters (Rothschilds) in a satanic-masonic ritual...
Heartbreaking isn't the word for this. This took my breath away. I thought i died inside. As a man who grew up in a christian family. This hit me hard. I teared up at the site of one of the most iconic historical cathedral with almost 1000 years of history behind. I will never see that beautiful monument the same. But ill never forget this pain in my heart. My prayers are with everyone. This is a test from God testing if we still love and have complete faith in him. It's time we all stand as one. Reach up high and pray with all your might.
That is good it's getting rebuilt although it's gonna take a 5-year renovation :v
So sad about the eleven other churches burned this month in France........
Thoughts and prayers from  canada god be with you and i hope they manage to get the fire out
Burn hollywood burn..ovo vam je za onu šiptarsku zastavu..Great Serbia
Spire collapsing...Blame Trump...he did it...cnn collapsing as well.
Just go visit Al Jazeera and see their comments and reactions...
That’s so sad
I just want to say. Notre Dame is not lost. It's been rebuilt in the past so hopefully it can be rebuilt again. I just think we should all have hope for this amazing piece of history. Let's remeber that the WHOLE  thing isn't gone thankfully. And we should just all have hope
The New Zealand church burning and the Louisiana 3 black churches were burned down were connected to black metal musicians. Anyone have a hunch this might be more of the same? I hope not. If so, Norway 1992 all over again and again.
Why did the Notre Dame burn down?
Use fire retardant from helicopters
İf god did this why ? İs this a message
Why so many people is happy to see this piece of art burning up?
Heartbroken
Imagine if this comes out that some guy just flicked a cigarette and being the reason it was ignited.
Beautiful monument crumbled into ashes feeling sad for Parisans. My family had  beautiful memories posing in front of the church 2 years back.
I had heard there were at least 10 recent Arsons against Paris Churches, was this connected?

my guess the socialists wont be having any luciferian theater plays or shows at Notre Dame for while.. . i can hear their horror in the commentary.
l  HOMME  est impuissant
So sad....I have no chance to visit this church...Pray from Indonesia
So sad to see the damage.  Getting chills. 🙏🙏🙏
1 minute silence for the cathedral
1:01
I was there just two weeks ago with my school. It hurts to see all that history destroyed and to see such an incredible building destroyed. The inside was incredible, with the glass windows, and all of that is lost.
Fired bombed i would think coming up to Easter.
No problem... they'll now hire the outfit that does stucco for Walmart, and modernize the old heap.
Dame thats very unfortunate, I wish no one is hurt.
It's a distraction to throw you off " beware".
“Love is like a tree: it grows by itself, roots itself deeply in our being and continues to flourish over a heart in ruin. The inexplicable fact is that the blinder it is, the more tenacious it is. It is never stronger than when it is completely unreasonable.” 
― Victor Hugo, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame
YAY!!! BURN BABY BURN!!!
Can't believe that such a storied, impressive landmark can be destroyed in almost an instant. We should all respect the brave fire fighters who selflessly battled this destructive force.🇬🇧🇫🇷
Extremely sad to watch history going off the flame
Burn baby burn disco inferno. This is from the church of the Crusades, Inquisition, Colonialism, Pedo Priests etc. I'm not crying!
Rip
Heard Macron will have it rebuilt and form an international fundraiser to bring it back. We have to see if he follows through on this tragedy.
What had happen😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Can’t believe this. Such a beautiful building, all gone. A travestie. All the Stainglass windows. Melted. Spire. Burnt down. All of it. Gone! 😭💔 Praying For All. We lost a piece of us all today 😭
So, so sad, but good that no lives have been lost.  Notre Dame will be rebuilt and the crafts to do so rekindled.  😔
Oo-la-la  - OO-LA-LA!! 😂
France was no longer a Christian nation anyway.
Satan lives 🤘🙏
We will rebuild, very sad, will the French tax  payer pay for the reconstruction or is the Pope going to donate money for this massive job to reconstruct?
What's  so flammable that's 
 making it burn like hell, hopping it was an accident and not else more, a sad event for humanity, what a great loss for the man kind!!!
Notre Dame burns
Parisian muslims looking to build a mosque: its free real estate.
Is it the revenge of God Jupiter?
Orale🔥🔥🔥
I wish this was fake news...
Are they surprised it didnt collapse
What caused the fire?
Can it be rebuilt at least ?
I guess we now know what ninja really did in europe
Terror attack ?
Maybe it's a sign for Easter Jesus said that he will tear down his temple sand rebuild it in three days. I send my prayers to everyone effected by this horrific incident. Happy Holy Week. Remember to say your prayers, be kind, and be careful.
so sad.....but how did it catch on fire?
Somehow very symbolic & an Omen of the troubled times we live in.
Know why
I'm so sorry to see this. Btw why is the smoke yellow?
The French might as well build a mosque over the ruins.
So sad
Such a great loss to the world, and more so to the french people.
So sad
The cathedral is saved! The firefighters have saved it from the fire and the insides didn't burn, this is incredible
Tambien hay excelentes piromanos hace frio aqui
I think it the Yellow vest who burnt it down. They burned the Eiffel tower so would not surprise me if they did this.
God want us be the the church that can share love to others  & have relationship with the father in heaven , not primarily the buildings. Pray that it will be restored soon .
Perhaps God could have stopped this or perhaps there is no god. Which is the most likely answer?
It's the extremist rhetoric from the left that has caused this.
It’s good it burned down before it would be turned into a mosque
Does anyone has any idea how it happened. It's very sad. 😥😥
Who burn the place?
How did it got burned?
Thanks Obama
Thoughts and prayers from Manila, this is truly a horrendous fire.
Christ has returned!!!
is that scaffolding.. was some maintenance going on ? i went to paris 10 yrs back .. failed to see notre dame .. i feel gutted now.. i hope france  rebuilds it
nice！
حدث رهيب ومؤلم
a heart-breaking and irreplaceable loss.
Oh no . It's horrible 🙏😥
and commie cnn and their beloved marxistglobalist cronies had nothing to do with this of course.
遗憾...
Still lucky
Cnn fake news  posting news.  wow
😂🤣🤣🤣👍🏿👌🏼
How come no xian will step up and claim it as an act of God, punishing the Church for celebrating their wealth and power and not doing the works Jesus charged them with?
What does it take? An earthquake?
When i saw this on live T.V it just made me feel sick to my stomach,much in the same way when the twin towers came down.I'm still trying to digest it.
Its clearly the FALL OF CHRISTIANITY in France indicated by Lord Jesus himself. Everyone sadly knows that France is no more the christian country now!
This breaks my Heart. America mourns with you Paris. In the name of Jesus. Please fill the people of Paris with your love, compassion, hope & the Holy Ghost this Easter 😍
Trumps fault
Whoever is responsible for that fire must be feeling pretty shitty right now. I'd take that to the grave with me.
There is a video of a priest or Muslim on the scaffolding TWO HOURS after the fire started. ALSO, Reports from former secretary of defense of Canada, Robert Steele, that two bodies were found inside the two bullets each.
C’est un coup des gilets jaune
It's so devastating to see this beautiful building of history being destroyed bit by bit

Ireland is mourning with you my French  friends
😭😭😭😭😭
Hellfire..
😭😭😭😭😭
Breaking news! Trump's tax returns were in the spire for some reason - oops!!
Fires like that do not start on their own.....but the cause will be kept secret....very sad to lose a monument of this magnitude....
My family and I visited there recently last Thursday. Seriously not kidding. Glad we saw the whole cathedral before the fire.
Nobody:


President trump: jUSt dRoP a wAteR bOMb
Definitely not an "accident"
Just one water-gusher? Where are the helicopters with water-ballons?
SAD 😥 INDEED  😰

Deepest sympathies🙏 from Kenya 🇰🇪
DOWN WITH CHRISTIANITY
Those whistles sound like Saint Denied in red dead redemption
Godless France punished by the Wrath Of God.
Prayers from Scotland!
Its so sad Notre Dame survived World War 1 & 2 with all those bombings, but only took minutes to destroy it by fire through a renovation incident. tragic.💔💔💔😭😭😭
This is great for France, so much publicity so much money pledged and so much compassion from everyone, greatest thing that happen to France for the past years
7:00   1 hose? They didn't even try to put the fire out.
French history and brilliance gone. Its like seeing the Eiffel Tower on fire. Very sad and depressing.
I know this is a very sad and terrifying moment but did anyone else see the guy pass by at 0:44
Hope they build a mosque on top of the burnt church.  Icing on the cake.
Message
😭😭😭
Very symbolic, Could be some kind of a sign for some history incoming event
😭😭😭
People cry for a building but forget humanity in Palestine and Israel... how typical
Glad it wasn’t Sacré Cœur. Every heritage site in the world always needs to be on high alert. The Islamic radicalists want to destroy Christian heritage.
The crown of thorns..how do we know these relics are even real?
I love Paris! It is sad and astonishing! Can't this be an end to the endless protests that's ruining the nation fate of France! I'm from China. I know what national fate means for an ancient civilization. When all the citizens work together devotedly with the aim of building a better country, everything goes smoothly. On the contrary, when people fight and protest against everything that government does, the whole country will be just like a chaos waiting for endless accidents and incidents!
0:31 I like how the Americans say 'horror' 0:31. It's more like 'hrrrrrrrrr'
How have the French already determined this was an accident already ????
Qué horrible y en Semana Santa ... Más de 850 años de arte e historia.  😢
all I can do is cry. this is a true loss to all of us.
Y'all better not blame Trump for this.
Behold a country without boarders!
Almost 200 years to be built, destroyed in less than a day! Now they can build a big mosque!
This sad this beautiful church went down.  It has history. God must be devasted of this . So close for good Friday and Easter Sunday and this happen. My prayers goes out to Paris and this amazing church gone. It's sad it breaks my heart watching it burn down just like 9-11 . I hope they well built a new one. Never give up history always built new.
It's like when an animal goes extinct. Piece of history gone!
So sad, this stood as a symbol for France and Europe, it’s History burned away, as an American I stand with France 🇺🇸🇫🇷 🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸🇫🇷🇺🇸
When they colonized and looted others,they didn't give pity to the cultures they destroyed.
Very sad.
Um.so heart broken 850 years of history  gone 😭😭😭😭😭
France needs to come back to Christ.
In the last 12 months, 800 churches in France had been desecrated or set on fire. But it is not FAKE refugees doing this... 
And you think that Notre Dame fire was an ACCIDENT????? yeah, right... see other peoples views: 
dingle dooley:April 2019: The fact that officials were calling it an accident before the fire was out, and the long string of desicrated churches throughout Europe following the migration crisis certainly looks suspicious.
Christian B:April 2019: Seems odd to me they would immediately say it’s not arson or terrorism when nobody knows what happened.
THIS LADY NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS WILL NOT REMAIN DOWN
https://youtu.be/Ct_w2YCPXSI
The good news in all this is, that no one died in this fire, while wood and stone can be replaced, and even improved, despite the haters. Hopefully, the future roof will be made if possible, of non-flammable material, like steel and aluminum beams, including the spire; and like a phoenix rising from its ashes, maybe this old cathedral could become better than ever, as a model for environment friendly clean energy with new generation solar panels roofing, like a shining beacon on the whole world.

CETTE DAME NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS NE RESTERA PAS VAINCUE

La bonne nouvelle dans tout cela, c'est que personne n'est mort dans cet incendie, alors que le bois et la pierre peuvent être remplacés, voire améliorés, malgré les haineux. Espérons que le futur toit sera fabriqué, si possible, en matériau ininflammable, comme des poutres en acier et aluminium, y compris la flèche; et comme un phénix renaissant de ses cendres, peut-être même que cette vieille cathédrale pourrait devenir mieux que jamais, comme un modèle d'énergie propre et plus respectueux de l'environnement, avec une toiture de panneaux solaires nouvelle génération, comme un phare sur le monde entier.

Why is everyone pretending Notre Dame is done for? It was a bad fire sure. The spire collapsed sure. The stained glass is gone sure. But the beauty of Notre Dame is the gothic stone architecture, The flying buttresses, gargoyles, etc. Those things are still there.
How did it happen
I wonder who burned it down?
How long will it be before the tinfoil hat brigade starts conspiracy theories about inside jobs & controlled demolitions?
This is an affront to Catholicism. I believe that ISIS or the Yellow Vests, if not both, are responsible for this inferno.
Rip always wanted to go there I hop the cathedral in Barcelona still being built until 2026 which is going to this summer hope it doesn’t burn down
Thank you so much for your support. It goes right to my heart. I'm in Paris right now(i'm frensh) and i'm glad to see people supporting Paris like this 🙂🙂🙂🙂
ALL THE HARLOTRY IS BEING BURNT.
😢
So why didn't god stop the fire?
I can't believe it. I feel like there's probably going to be so many dead bodies they'll find considering the size.
Respect from italy🇮🇹🇮🇹 cugini francesi
My God! I'm Brazilian and I heard about the news as well as many others around the world! Centuries and stories being burned! It is already the 8th "accident" that happens in Europe; and many more "accidents" come
What is the cause of fire?
:(
TRUMP DID IT!!!!!!!
I’m just surprised that CNN actually has a correspondent in Paris. 22 weeks of yellow vest protest and not a report. Must of borrowed her from RT.
There's the diversity you wanted...in exchange of your culture, your identity, and your very Catholic Faith
CAN SOME1 SAY, IT WAS DONE PURPOSELY TO COLLECT WE KNOW WHAT? THIS REMIND ME OF 911 BUT NO LIVES LOST. THE FRENCH ARE TEARING DOWN THE OLD AND WILL PUT UP A NEW STRUCTURE.
Da Feld das dach runter
😭😭
Yeahh
Will be rebuilt ! 

The UNESCO already is giving its help.
What's worse is some guy probably didn't put his cigarette out and caused it
Why are the people watching not trying anything at all to help
Que triste 😢
Not to be offensive but this is like the 9/11 of Paris
If you had the privilege to have been to the Norte Dame you cant help but be sad . It was so beautiful 
When people work together they can create something as beautiful as the Cathedral it took such a long time to create
Chinese people will never forget the shame of the past，Burning well
Hellfire
Hang in there paris ! It's all part of the big man upstairs plan somehow someway
bro I was there 2 years ago this makes me so sad
😢😢😢😢😢
😭😢
J'ai honte qu'une partie de l'histoire de mon pays parte en fumé comme une allumette sans que l'on puisse faire quelques choses , c'est un viol , c'est un vol. 😠
Thank God! It's not a terrorist attack.
Karma
Oh my gosh. No way. Such a tragedy! Iconic history burnt to the ground. Does anybody know how it started?
So so typical, burning the historical church to distract the whole world from the crime of intentionally burning Alaqsa Mosque in Palestine (located inside the occupied area by Israel). 

Hey Macron, if you're indeed conspiring against your people to let the crime of burning the church distract the outside world and French citizens their movements against your stupid policy. The whole world will never forgive you for that. 

Hey AIPAC news channel (CNN) you intentionally didn't cover the burning of the Alaqsa Mosque.

Wake up world, Zionists are on the move.
What started the fire ?
Prayers from Poland! I went to Notre Dame around a year ago, and I was in awe at how beautiful this cathedral was and was just amazed at how well it stood after 850 years. What a terrible tragedy, our hearts are with Paris, and the people of it.
One day. Two robbers entered the old Summer Palace. One robbed and the other set fire to it. It can be said that victory is the thief's victory, the two winners together completely destroyed the yuanmingyuan. One was called France, the other English!——Victor Hugo
Wow they fought against a fire? I thought they would raise a white flag and surrender
Unfortunately，Historical artifacts are great，I hope that you can rebuild this great building，from china，If there is a rebuilding donation, I will definitely donate 1,000 euros, even though I am only a student.
Where did the fire starts?
We had a similar experience with Windsor Castle in 92. Very upsetting for France 🇫🇷🇬🇧
六道好轮回
Jesus said that the Temple in Jerusalem would be destroyed 'not one stone left upon another' (Mt 24:2)
and 40 years later it came to pass. So if God is willing to allow His building to be destroyed, how much more the buildings of man.
Hopefully the spire isn’t replaced with a dome
Most beautiful Church I always visit for prayer when I am in Paris. This is a great loss for the whole world and all catholic christians in the world.
Right after palm sunday :/
It's just a building! What about the millions of millions of human lives harmed?
😢😢
Literally only one fire truck wtf? Also heard this wasn't an accident. What the hell is going on in Paris.
Maybe god doesn't love them😑
I've been there twice, both times with my grandmother. During my second visit I went to confession, there was several priests representing a variety of languages.
Recule sale folle tu comprend le français ?
Why did the firefighters reach on site 45 minutes!!! after the fire was reported???
Why did the authorities rush to declare the fire as an accident before the fire was stopped, before investigating this incredible tragedy?
The entire wood structure was the driest possible, for centuries. It acted not as a regular fuel, but as accelerator for fire. Knowing this,  why didn't the authorities plann in advance and use adequate fire fighting measures, as helicopters or water bombarding planes, especially when they had a huge water source near the cathedral???!!!
My soul is mourning the destruction of this religious and historical icon of the world but the important questions must be answered.
From Romania, I'm sending my saddest condoleances and deep feelings of sympathy and support to the people of France, for this terrible loss.
May God strengthen them in their faith!
Omg
But the real question is HOW DID IT CATCH ON FIRE
WAS IT AN ARSONIST?
WHO  KNOWS!
(also Rest in peace notre dame! you historical building that I've never heard of 😭)
Wife said the church is in fire. Damn my first thought was "hope no Muslim name is involved to this" it's sad to hear this story. Hope everyone is ok. Hope we become United someday and live in a peaceful world again.
Tragic loss of a spectacular building.
Poor reporting...CNN do a better job !
What a shame
When you open fire at a mosque and they literally open fire back
pour tous ceux qui se lamentent sur la destruction de la Cathedrale de Notre Dame:
en 1240 a eu lieu un jugement de l'Eglise contre les Juifs justement a Notre Dame
en 2019 cette meme eglise a ete incendiee, en contrepartie des 12,000 livres du Talmud qui y ont ete brules suite au jugement
24 charrettes remplies de livres du Talmud et de Rouleaux de Torah y ont ete brules, et exactement 24 etages y ont ete detruits cette semaine
Note: depuis l'an 1240 et jusqu'a aujourd'hui en 2019, 779 ans se sont ecoules
en gematrria, cela eqivaut a cette annee-ci: תשע"ט
c'est le doigt de K'!
merci de transmettre ce message au plus grand nombre de Juifs possible, afin qu'ils comprennent la grandeur du Moment
et que cette Paque nous soit en benediction!
Hag Pessach sameach et cacher a chaque famille de Am Israel! Am Israel Hay!
Anyone remember what French did in China? We said this is cycle
Anyone know what caused the fire?
Remember islam is peace kafir
💔💔💔
💔💔💔
Good 👍😎
Oh why...I was in Paris last month for 2 weeks and it was a dream come true to see Notre Dame...we all didn't know it would be destroyed...why did it ended this way :( :( :(
Reminds me of the scene from Name of the Rose film where an  imposing gothic structure of medieval Western Christendom burns, with all the priceless manuscripts inside, a wealth of knowledge,  lost to the world for ever. This treasure of the world must be restored.
News is reporting trouble getting water to the scene. Also that firefighters we're onscene early. When a building has been standing for 800 years. There is no excuse for any issues related to water supply or tactical operations.  You had centuries to make a detailed operational plan.   The fire could have immediately overwhelmed them. Fine, there still should have been countless contingency plans for operating at this historic cathedral and containing the fire to it's original area and protecting the rest of it. A true tradgedy. Ask you local fire department if they have contingency plans for your legacy structures. Iconic churches, hospitals, schools and care facilities. Ask them. If they don't give you the correct answer encourage them.. Lives are on the line, theirs and ours.. thanks and God bless the first responders.
Look this up - Marie Julie Jahenny- stigmatist from Breton France - Jesus said to her - “When you see Paris burning you will come to know that God’s justice for the church and the world has arrived’
This prove that jesus christ was not the son of god. Buddha is the real god
So sad news for whole of the world ☹️😭.. peace from INDIA
All these CENTURIES some people found in that temple relief and strength for their problems, RESPECT THAT HUMANOIDS. The reaction here on comments by those who say "let it burn" or express their hate againts ANY religion, IS THE SAME AS THOSE CAVEMEN WHO BLASTED ALL ANCIENT MONUMENTS DOWN IN SYRIA. You and ISIS are the same waste of oxygen. One day EVERYBODY will answer for our sins, dont worry. Humanoids.....And by the way, if one of your family or you got, for expample, cancer or something else, then at that time "pray" to your atheist entity or read some anarchist book to feel better. Till then, keep fly that high but you forgot the story of Icarus...."Μπραβο"  και στο σχολιο απο εναν "Ελληνα"  που ειδα εδω, κλασικο ανθρωποειδες αμορφωτο και απλυτο απεξω και απο μεσα.
the buildings going to collapse and the fire is still burning
Meh 🤷‍♂️
Damn Muslim Extremists. Oooops. This is CNN. No such thing as Extremism or deliberate acts or terrorism.
This is terrible -From England
France doesn't respect their own long christian tradition. It's a symbol, beside who did it, we know. Many churches were destroyed earlier by local authorities.
Let there be absolutely no question about it, this is an attack on Western values, Western culture and Western Religion.  There is no question that this fire was set.  This was arson committed by the usual suspects who are attacking Christianity all over Europe.  It will be covered up and the usual suspects in the media will continue to lie about the actual cause of the destruction of one of the greatest works of art in the world.
Sacre Blu!
lol
I’m truly sorry.One of the most beautiful landmarks in the world burnt...what’s next...
Prayers from Greece
Look like isis
Cool.
Resurection of Christ be with Our Lady and the French people in sorrow.
Now the questions is how and why. I hope it wasn’t something done on purpose.
NIEN!! Warum musste es die Notre Dame sein? alle unsere gebete aus deutschland 😭😭😭😭😭😢💔🙏⛪✝️🇩🇪
有一天，两个来自欧洲的强盗闯进了圆明园。一个强盗洗劫财物，另一个强盗在放火。似乎得胜之后，便可以动手行窃了。他们对圆明园进行了大规模的劫掠，赃物由两个强盗均分。将受到历史制裁的这两个强盗，一个叫法兰西，另一个叫英吉利。——摘自《巴黎圣母院》作者雨果的《就英法联军远征中国致巴特勒上尉的信》
Sad!
When will the replacement Mosque be completed? France is an Islamic Caliphate non?
Heartbreaking. It was on my bucket list to see. I will still go to Paris but it won't be the same. SW Florida sends its love to the people of France.
wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that one of them fckd up members of the religion of piece deliberately set fire to it
Good bye notre dame de Paris. Farewell my friend
😩😩😩
This is just as sad as 9/11 prayers for France
I hope the the people are okay
My prayers and condolences go out to the people of France. From all of us across the world, we know you will rebuild.
Same day The Aqsa Mosque in paletine has been burnt by Israeli terrorists, but western media didn't reported it. 
Is it just a coincidence?
1:06 0:44 | quality content (guy on scooter and black hat)
Feeling sad.I finished my degree in Notre Dame School here in the philippines.the catholic school in the philippines..😢
No surprise if it turns out some islamist cell is being behind this arson attack. Islamist wage war against non muslims and their holy cites. Regardless if they're christians, hindus or jews. 

It a well known fact that islamism has infiltrated many aspect of the french underworld.
Goddammit Varg
Lol yeah like a measly fire is gonna take out the stone church itself. This obviously was a attack on God.
It isn't  sad than you do colony on my country 90 years and you also cut our Cambodian lowland for Vietnamese government till today...we lost 24 provinces and 15 million in Uneducated.
Where were firemans? It's the centre of the city! They should use helicopters and so one
oh my gut
I dont like french people.
Take heart good Christians for the Crown of thorns has been saved. How much more important is this one single relic than the entire Cathedral that housed it? As an American Catholic, I am sad for the loss of a great French symbol of Catholicism throughout the centuries, but I feel that the goodwill created by its rebuilding will be a blessing from God. The walls of this Cathedral still stand and it will be resurrected in full glory like our Christ. Happy Easter.✝️
My heart brakes. It is a real tragedy - this Cathedral is so closely connected  with history, art, literature of the World. A real tragedy for all of us...
Whey
The Mustards burned it! Wake the Hell up people! Mosques aren't fireproof you know...
This Spire falls Normally as opposed to The Spire at the WTC Ritual. And no copters used here. Water is too heavy and will damage the relics worse than the fire. Really. Like Jerry Moonbeam Brown said, get used to it this is the new normal. France is the most atheist nation on earth. This will only be an economic loss a historical loss a new tax
   I just googled AviationGuide_FINAL_webpdf and there are SOOOO many copters and planes to drop water. Boeing 747 holds 24,000 gallons. Saw that one at The Aspen Fire, near me. And most copters hold 100-400 gallons. A Sikorsky skycrane holds 2650 gallons. DC7 holds 3000 gallons. But no Water for Notre Dame!! Funny world
a monk dropped a bong on the carpet
The muslims burned it they burned it they and the zionists they shall pay pay with there blood for this ! Our greatest cathedral gods house stood there for hundreds of years build by our grandfathers by the strength of there backs by hard work and devotion payed with there blood , sweat and lives they left it as our heritage and we carried it as our pride as our cultural heritage and history of our great and wonderful achievement to god ,we loved it as if it where our lady , and as a lady she was beautifully  decorated from top to bottom for over more than 8 hundred years she stood glancing here beauty over the rooftops in paris people came from far and beyond to admire her she was the pride of the nation of europe of who we were and are i hope that many of our people haven't forgotten that but the government they sure did with there open borders church after church vandalised ,burned hunderds of them by immigrants this my dearest people is undeniably a deliberate attack by muslim immigrants on france and europe's sovereignty on our religion its an attack on our selfs and the people of france , but we will not fade we stand determined to fight for our land and heritage for our lady who stood in paris we shall make them pay 40times over we will take the fire to them and make them feel our pain our loss we will fight on the landing ground's we will fight on the beaches , in the city's and in the streets we will fight in the hills and in the air, we shall never surrender
This is horrible just horrible a place full of history, art, and religion. Prayers sent to those who are very affected by this, from a Texan catholic
MACRON = NERON
Don't be sad american people ! the french history is not just "notre dame" et "le moulin rouge". we have a big old past that makes us have a great social system today; we love your films or your series but we don't want your capitalism hard with the weak.Unfortunately, this privatized state model has been perfected in USA and it is now trying to impose itself on us. This is where the deep crisis of yellow vests. For example, we have 5 weeks of paid leave in France and whoever you will be treated at the hospital. Our pensions are based on solidarity and not on capitalization as at home. It's far from perfect, cause of the same multinationals that govern you, we're in shit. good evening american friends
I literally have an art history paper on the Notre Dame Cathedral tomorrow🙁
The $1,000,000,000 dollars that has been donated to the Notre Dame Cathedral could’ve been used to clean all of the great pacific garbage patch
I dont know if this was an attack against religion or something but its just so devastating for everyone. This is not religion. Its the history of all humankind..
Finally something happen now this is a meme yeess!!
Why are people praying? I assume to their god ? So is god saying "OK OK ... now that you've prayed to me .. I will save the church ..." If he were real ... why would he let his house be burnt in the first place? There is no god thats why ...
I'm so sorry for you from Rossendale.
I can't believe that it survived two world wars, several French wars and a revolution. But it is currently being destroyed by a renovation fire. 😔 I'm sorry and am thinking of you all tonight 🙏
Highly unprofessional accident
Stay strong France. Hold your heads High and rebuild. To CNN just 
watched you trash a good man Bernie Sanders for writing a book and 
making some money off his hard work. Bernie Probably did a lot of good 
with that money as well. I UN-subscribed from CNN to let them know how I
 feel about their tasteless video on Bernie Sanders. I hope millions 
will Follow.
Quasimodo's bell house survived.
If you're white and reading this you're next.
maybe is a punch mark of God...
😥😥😥🙏
Here we go again with the dum president of the United States suggesting that flying water tankers could be used to put the fire out. I wish Trump would do his homework before making  a suggestion. Afterall, clearly he should have known that his suggestion could result in the collapse of the entire structure.
Today France lost its history. Shame.
Verry sad... Prayers from Denmark 🙏🏻❤️🇫🇷
Looking on in horror? Lol...its sadness, not horror.  9/11 was horror.  If you equate the two you've lost your minds,  CNN.
And have Christian musical artists have concerts to promote the fund.  Like Live Aid for the cathedral
A Muslim temple will take over, this is how Europe is gonna be in the near future.

It's happened before, and they will rebuild it once again.
The fire was set by a Muslim
Not surprising and a bit of irony that a place where children are murdered,raped and houses some of the most vile and evil people in the world gets consumed by Hell Fire. Also this is controlled like every other event in the world.
its not the Muslims Okay.
So which Republican is going to say this was gods wrath because of the gays? You know it’s coming
Such tragedy. Sadly this symbolizes fall of the old Europe and order. New things are coming :/ Condolences from Czech Republic
I hope charlie hepedo show us their sarcasm now to prove their secularism
It's sad of course, historically an important piece of housing for pedofiles. But WHAT am I saying!! I didn't mean that of course.
Is CNN going to blame Trump for this fire???
I was really sad when I saw this. Notre Dame cathedral is the most beautiful cathedral in the hole world. France is a big and rich nation. If they can't fix the cathedral then they are going to do best for it. Hold on, France!
Best thoughts from Croatia. 🇭🇷🇫🇷
Now the question is how long it will take for the reconstruction.   Apparently, a Chinese company needs only 1 or 2 years to restore it (without the artistic articles restoration).  But it has been announced in France for 10 years and loss of billions of tourists visits revenues during the reconstruction works.
Don't  watch CNN racist democratz, who hate most Americans and our prez, go away
Muslims loved watching this happen.
Seems like american twin towers in 2001.
Do they have the name of the person who did this? And please don't tell it was an accident!  IJS🤔
On the bright side, maybe some pedophile priests were killed in the fire.
As Notre Dame burns people are shouting praise Allah. They are celebrating the burning of the church the same as those 5 Israelis did in NJ across the river NY on 911. We are in end times and by those Islamic now in the House of Congress they are infiltrating and destroying us from within. In Jesus name I pray for God's vengeance to be swift. Amen
i would like to see Muslims come and pray with the Chirstians just to ease off the tensions like they did in New Zealand.
Julijs vainigs bled
Such a big loss for humankind... 

I always wanted to see this Cathedral with beautiful gothic architecture, it's devastating to see now it burned down.😔

Turkey is grieving with you. ❤
Looks like 9/11
OOF
Come on, Frollo. 
Jokes aside, this is so heartbreaking. :(
Arson investigators need to be on scene.
Why this beautifully cathedral ...😿😭
Allahu akhbar.
The new 9/11
"Our Father who is in Heaven
Our Mother who is inside Earth"
is how I'll start my 1st ever prayer tonight

Incredible loss for Paris and France. Wishes from the UK 🙏🏻🙏🏻 It reminds me of the tragedy of Grenfell tower in England.
I am crying right now 😭
This means something worse will happen globally
Why are MSM not mentioning that earlier this month the historic Church of St Sulpice in Paris was set ablaze by an act of arson, as reported by Newsweek magazine?  Newsweek  ran a story about Catholic churches in France suffering recent acts of desecration and vandalism since the beginning of this year.
Damn this sucks. 800 years of history and beautiful architecture, gone in the blink of an eye. I’ve always wanted to see it in person, now that cannot happen, hopefully some of it can be repaired. Viva la france
Nooooo!! How did this even happen , im so sad ..
My heart is broken
So heartbreaking,I'm sorry,but to me it's feels like watching the towers collapsed in 9/11
😬
The Pope gets on his knees and kisses the feet of blacks.  God is displeased.  God sends a sign.
The Kingdom of Heaven is coming

Looks like muslims are at it again.
Je penses que ce sont des musselmans qui a fait ça.
I don't know if it was an accident or not, but shame on you who are happy with this. Beside your beliefs it was a magnificent piece of culture and history not just for Christianity but for the world as well. I am very sorry for any monument that was destroyed and even though I believe they will rebuild it it will never be the same. Despite your faith, any mindful human being must be able to acknowledge the value of monuments like that. They represent world's history!
After this incident in Sri Lanka where churches went into fire etc. etc.. it is beginning to be a little suspicious that Notre Dame was a accident...?? Maybe it was terrorism.. ( now I said it )..
CNN doesnt really care, they wage war against religion unless it's islam
Very good mashallah, now we muslims can build a mega masjid now inshallah

THE CORPORATE U.S. GOV SPENT 4.6 MILLION DOLLARS ON THEIR LOBSTER DINNERS LAST YEAR..."WAKEY-WAKEY, EGGS AND BAKEY".
This is the prelude for western civilization.
Looool
I’m not religious but it is sad to see a piece of history go down like this
bad omen, reminds me yuanmingyuan, now I think french kinda know how we feel when it burn by westerners purposely during those days.
Way to kick France while she's down, universe. Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, rise of the far-right, political turmoil leading to riots, and now this... Even where I live, here in Canada, taxi services were apparently swamped by calls from people going to their local Catholic church to pray. It's heartbreaking.
Sadly this represents western culture in Europe to a tee.
Did you know 
It was the most important for Paris.
I now feel very privileged that I was able to see it when I was in Paris a few years ago. What a shame.
Thank goodness no one has injured. I hope France will rebuilt Notre Damme again. Thoughts and prayer for you.
GUCCIE GANG, GUCCIE GANG, GUCCIE GANG, GUCCIE GANG. YUH
Omg so sad; it’s glory will be missed!
Another disappointing year filled with disaster...
Meanwhile President Stable Genius suggests putting out the fire with flying water tankers...
They sure are trying hard to put it out with that ONE hose. Maybe another ONE on the otherside eh? If they wanted to save it thay should have listened to Trump and dropped  fire retardant from planes. They just outfitted 6 jumbo jets for that specific task last year in Paris. They wanted to burn it. FF attack prolly.  Thank goodness no one was killed. That we know of... Seems like there would be a couple of dozen hoses spraying on it. C'mon Paris you guys were making progress with your yellow vests. BUT, who knows outside of Paris what this could push to the surface, maybe there was some evil sh!t going down in that church/cathedral whatever. Maybe it needed to burn to make a statement. I dunno. It's just sad to have to lose such an amazing 800 year old structure. Especially if it was because of some strife that the establishment could see their way through. Au revoir, Notre Dame.
When the cathedral spire collapsed under fire, it reminded me of 9/11 attack on world trade centre when the tower collapsed to rubble.((
This is excellent news, Macron can finally build the Mosque there he always wanted.
Imagine how many deflowered alter boys are cheering as they watch this!
I have a Strong Feeling this is Not Over Yet!!! I'm concerned about what's to come!!! Prayers
This is literally like Hunchback of Notre Dame.
1:33 this loces like 9/11
This is not the fall of the spire but the end of the glorious past of europe and initiation into the dark age infested by the agnostic moronns and islamic bigots...
Shame I never  see the Notre dame in Real Life
Inshallah a new Mosque will replace this building soon. Mohammad PBUH had great respect for Jesus
Every country should look at their fire code. A construction project this size should have temporary fire protection. Too many other construction projects have burned and these accidents just repeats itself.
So much corruption in the Catholic religion God’s wrath they have more wealth than the whole world put together but don’t help anybody
Why they haven’t use the helicopters water bombers
They will replaced it with a mosque to welcome all the new illegal immigrants and growing Muslim population in the country
Lo sentimos mucho hermanos franceses Atte los Mexicanos
Melissa looks like Sonja Morgan from The Real Housewives of NY.
This is really a tragedy! But at least it was an accident. Yes we all should feel sorry for the loss, because it is a heritage of us all! But what about 155 churches and monasteries destroyed in Kosovo on purpose by muslim Albanians from 1999. till now? Why didn't the world cry about those? Why nobody is talking about that? And most of those are from 12th to 14th century. Many of them on UNESCO world heritage list. Here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Serbian_heritage_in_Kosovo
I'm french and i'm very sad 😩 it's more than 1000 years of History , the fireman say " maybe we cannot stop the propagation of the fire "
Suddenly everyone knows about Notre Dame, it will be rebuilt, stop freaking out and acting like you care, this is actually good for publicity and tourism.
When the Paris police are knocking and priests need to get rid of their child porn collection haha.
WTF
What a sad day today as it was engulfed by fire. Prayers from Chicago to this beautiful church of God. Am still happy they don’t charge anyone who visits the church even tho they badly needed money to renovate it. We Americans 🇺🇸 will help you like we did in 1945. We’ll take away your sorrow and sadness for the church ⛪️ and fill it with joy and grace of God again. France 🇫🇷 and USA 🇺🇸 together again. Christians united in the world in the name of Jesus Christ!
My hearth is breaking in milions of pieces, like the Hearth of the Paris, now, all is ashes.Such a religious loss for the world. A teribile day for the humanity, probably the most

With sadness, Sergiu.
oof.
I know those are completely different things, way different in meaning and reasons, but seeing this gave me flash backs from CNN's coverage of 9/11
It's not their country anymore..
I hope its not a terrorist attack !
I genuinely have tears in my eyes. I remember when I was traveling wondering how many future generations would be able to admire the historic sites of the world.
Edit: They should drop the Seine on this thing.
Symbol of western civilisation fall
The French not only burned China's Yuanmingyuan, but also burned their own Notre Dame.
False religion is over.
I haven't felt this sad since the Twin Towers and I'm British. Notre Dame will be a martyr to Christians everywhere. Haven't been to church for twelve years, I'm going this Sunday to pray for the good will of us all.
This is a loss for humanity, really tragic   and devastating. We mourn with you france. From a Chilean brother living in Sweden 🙏
No one is mentioning this, did anyone from the religion of peace commit this crime?
说实话，有人性的人看到都会觉得非常痛心！这是人类文化与建筑的瑰宝之一！但是，百年前八国联军的一份子法国人侵略火烧我万国之园的圆明园也是人类文化瑰宝，他们有反思忏悔过吗？这也从中更加证实了佛法中所说的：万法皆空，因果不空！人一定不能做坏事，天道好轮回，苍天绕过谁！不论任何国家，任何人，都一定要积德行善啊！
Ah that’s hot
Wow so big
GOD BLESS FRANCE💕💐

i can tell you i live near notre dame de paris i was wachting was happene  this is not terrorism stop   drama it's ok it's just acciden and rock who will be replaced no panic .  frensh in city they will recovery the cathédrale  it's acciden like in new York with the liner normandie in 1942 in new york  ..do  not dramatize I do not know. it is may be little a sign that it is full of rich. and the cop and the mayor of paris do nothing for the homeless and the street artist. so the whole world are  shocked then  people sleep on the street.  NO DRAMA  NOTHING HAPPEN IN PARIS ; IT S  THE MEDIA MAKING MORE AFRAID THEN IT S JUST AN ACCIDENT ;IT S STILL AGAIN THE STUPIDITY  OF HUMAINS
All the love from Iraq 🇮🇶
It took 2 hours for the fire  brigades  to arrive and the free mason media has already stated NO arson  is involved. How do they know. because  they are free masons n free masons burnt The Church before Good Friday cause they know millions will be Praying  at That Very Church
The statue of Mary on the top of the spire is going, “I’m flying, Jack!”
Well at least it's not our planet ....yet... but the sooner the better
Force Paris 🇫🇷
Students get shot and killed: Thoughts and Prayers.
The tower of an old building burns: We're donating billions to fix'er right up now!
I'm sorry for the church, but France has been looking for it. A colonizing country for centuries. It is less painful to cry for a church than for family members and relatives killed by bombs Next Libian  target.. Louvre.
I think we all know who is responsible for this.
Great, let's nuke Mecca once and for all.
I hate religion... but that place was a irreplaceable piece of art... history... and architectural genius
They really want muslims and christians to turn on each other and start fighting. Let's not give it to them.
most of the internet people dont know what france is or even where is europe is even if they live in it, but those stuck up filfths are so sad about this... :DD
If no one died as a result of this...... Forget that old ass building. Stop waisting energy on a  lame structure. Demolish what is left and move on
My heart breaks with you Quasimodo
In 1548, rioting Huguenots damaged some of the statues of Notre-Dame, considering them idolatrous.[13] During the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the cathedral underwent numerous alterations to comply with the more classical style of the period. The sanctuary was re-arranged; the choir was largely rebuilt in marble, and many of the stained glass windows from the 12th and 13th century were removed and replaced with white glass windows, to bring more light into the church. A colossal statue of St Christopher, standing against a pillar near the western entrance and dating from 1413, was destroyed in 1786. The spire, which had been damaged by the wind, was removed in the second part of the 18th century.

In 1793, during the French Revolution, the cathedral was rededicated to the Cult of Reason, and then to the Cult of the Supreme Being. During this time, many of the treasures of the cathedral were either destroyed or plundered. The twenty-eight statues of biblical kings located at the west facade, mistaken for statues of French kings, were beheaded.[14] Many of the heads were found during a 1977 excavation nearby, and are on display at the Musée de Cluny. For a time the Goddess of Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.[15] The cathedral's great bells escaped being melted down. All of the other large statues on the facade, with the exception of the statue of the Virgin Mary on the portal of the cloister, were destroyed.[9] The cathedral came to be used as a warehouse for the storage of food and other non-religious purposes.[13]
1 billion dollars in less than 40 hours...……….People still starving on the streets. Maybe someone should ask the pope why so much wasn't given to the poor. Maybe Christians should stop valuing stone more than human life and let the media influence their definition of being a Christian.
Another icon of western civilisation and culture destroyed. Thank you to the people responsible for it. Thank you for showing the weakness throughout the west. Rodin, Monet, Jeanne D'Arc, Bonaparte. They all weep at the destruction of what they built and protected. Most Europeans do too...
and next week, a islamic temple will replace it
The only men of God know that this fire was God's victory against these so called religions who are following only from their made up customs and traditions instead of worshipping God Alone. Whatever so called Christians are doing were not authorized by God.
All is not lost. What a bad way start the Holy Week
MUSLIMS DID IT.
Why does anyone listen to CNN?
Omg .....Oh Notre Dame. My heart. It hurts. Someone has done this!!!!
Da brennt die größte Kirche der Welt ....und ARD u. ZDF unterbrechen  
Nicht einmal das Sendeprogramm.... Was ist das  für ein erbärmlicher Staatssender geworden
RIP TB o Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro, malditos Esquerdopatas e Globalistas ⚠️
One of the workers repairing the church was probably a dark-skinned migrant who did not know about not smoking in the workplace.
Piss on it. lol

Sometimes I get nervous

She'd be with me whether I was flippin' a Tesla or Taurus
Ooh
I'm a mess, I'm a horror
But I been blessed kinda sorta
Every bar, brick and mortar can't sing
But I'm known to finesse on a chorus
You can't see the flow unless you using the eye of Horus
Ooh

[Chorus: FAT & Tobe Nwigwe]
Ayy look now that I got yo attention

Ooh
If you was wack, and you came up on some paper
You still lame
Yeah
Live by, die by the G code
Everyday it ain't a game
I promise you it's different
So don't compare how you move to the real
It ain't the same
but.... the people is looking at the fire... The Notre Dame is going on fire... and they... THEY DO A VIDEO? WHAT'S THEIR PROBLEMM
Wow this story is becoming really hot







I’m sorry

At 14:00 gmt Macron " I will have a solution for you [yellow vest] at 17:10 gmt reports of the Notre Dame burning.
We are with you France😔
To je hnusný!!
Islam wins the Struggle begins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will give my sympathy to the people of Syria or people who are dying in hunger than this old structure.
Don't cry France, rebuild it with a silver spire and roof will make it very special, mixing old with new will be very interesting, more visitors will come believe me.
So depressing to see something so magnificent literally turn to ash😢
Always wanted to see this place in person, even if I’m not a believer, hope this isn’t the end of the Notre Dame..
Its just a building, chill out. Besides, God is just laying waste to 
Sodom and Gomorrah (The Catholic Church). It was a Monument to 
Pedophilia and Sodomy.
Stop to attacke french people and also Islam in the comments,please!!!this work here is done by the same guys which are responsable also for 9/11!! watch Pet Goat II maybe you will see some similarities.
Sadly, the spire expired...
That was a sigh that what's coming next.. Will be much more worst from that.
Les Français sont tous extrêmement triste ce soir. C'est plus qu'une cathédrale c'est un symbole historique d'une nation qui est en train de partir en fumée. Je l'ai visité il y a 6 mois et jamais j'aurais imaginé que ça partira en fumée. C'est comme si les États-Unis prendraient la Statue de la Liberté. nous sommes extrêmement triste et tous unis dans la douleur 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷😭😭😭😭🤧
Here's my Highly Unpopular Opinion of the day:
"Notre Dame is burning, and it's such a historic place! "
Yeah, well, Manzanar is also historic. So is Dachau. And I have no respect for what any of the three represent, so big whoop.

I wonder if they heard of Nelly's it's gettin hot in here @scamaway
Certainly a plan to shut down the yellow vest movement . They don't respect anything!
Here's a prediction – Macron will want the re-build to include aspects of Islam to reflect the cultural state of France. There will be civil unrest in the streets if he even suggests it.
Will CNN investigate the Muslim construction workers?
We need to save a churches and a western world.
We can be HAPPY that the complete works of Bach and Palestrina and Dufay are still there. And that people will certainly reflect more about early christianity and threats to other masterpieces of western civilization.
Step 1: Stage an "accidental fire" at Notre Dame cathedral.
Step 2: Broadcast footage of the staged fire around the world.
Step 3: Hire teams of muslim men to rebuild the cathedral.
Step 4: Every time a native French citizen asks tough questions about immigration, have muslims go on TV and say "We rebuilt Notre Dame!"
Dirty police

That's symbolic fallen of the western civilization.. 
France! Be ashamed of you turning away from the Jesus Christ
It is man made. You poor poor people. It is only a building. Others have burned, and more will burn, before Jesus returns to earth and sets things straight.
Someone push Macron in the fire.
Save the nation.
Very suspicious of this. No way this was due to pure negligence.....
it look like a grande Dame burning on a bucher  the oldest  Dame in the world so sad  it was not only religion it was Art culture  852 yrs of history  the crown of Jesus was inside but was safe  !! strange the week of easter !! I wonder !!!!!!!!
Love from America, oh my god I can’t believe this happened! This is so messed up.
Napoleon is dying twice in Les Invalides
Is this a metaphor for western “democracy”?
if this isn't proof that God isn't real i don't know what is
Perfectly symbolizing the fall of western civilization.
这就是因果报应，这一刻法国人能感受到少许我们曾经的痛苦。Hey French，this is the Will of God。This is karma。just google that what did you do to the old Summer Palace in China。
It's an inside job.  There's now way the spire could collapse like that normally.
April 15 is a cursed day indeed...
The titanic sunk on april 15, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on april 15, the us tax day is also on april 15 lol
This is the saddest thing ever... Prayers from denmark💖
Muslims around the world can laugh out loud now, they must be pretty proud of this.
0.35 my heart is broken.
Burn it all I say! Burn it all!


To all of you who truly believe in the words of the Good Lord... Know this.


Although they be a nice token of the history of our religion, it is not the material structures and relics of old which define us. Our wonderful and most highly ideal religion (True and undefiled Christianity) is in need of an overhaul, a revival as such. While ever we take for granted that these age-old structures represent our religion, we are entirely missing the point of the words of Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour.


This will bring unity among the people as we join forces to remember what the point was to having it there in the first place, and will refresh the sentiment, the spirit behind the movement of Christianity itself.


Hallelujah! Burn them all Lord!  Thanks be to the most high.
A horrible loss. Absolutely unprecedented in modern history outside of war or natural catastrophe. 700 years in ruins. I actually feel sick to my stomach.
I don't know if you remember that one hundred years ago when you France burned the Yuanmingyuan Garden in Beijing, China, it was the same as it is today?
The time of the gentiles and heathens is ending this is so symbolic of that
الحمد لله والمجد والعزة لله
I can see the Democrat's headlines now, Trump colluded with the Russians to cause this tragic fire, the evidence will be overwhelming !
A sad reminder that all things fall into history, and then into nothingness. 
Memento mori.
Gods vengeance... welp🤷🏾‍♀️
This is a sign the human race is finished. Another world will be here soon no later than in 2076. The creator gave power to the Zionist for 300 years 1776-2076 soon they will give back this planet to its rightful owner the bronze race.  Look what happened to the Romans and the Egyptians it will happen to this world. Evolution is inevitable old ways of degeneracy must come to an end. Judgement Day is here. The creator will no longer allow the beast with his dog hair rule his planet no longer.
When u see all the disgusting muslims and negros on social media who celebrate this it's actually disturbing
waiting for papa...where is he...!
It's so sad to see such an Important building being destroyed, Heart breaking...
sam hyde is that you hiding  there.
CHRISTIAN EUROPE is BURNING!!!
It's a wake up call to some parisians who are soooooooo rude. And really rude (some Parisians)
I was thinking about visiting Notre Dame this year. Well...this saved my money.
Muslims have been attacking Catholic Churches and Cathedrals in Europe recently and for several years now.
Why they're not using helicopters and other new equipments..., I thought there are newer technologies in our days for fire fighting...
This is the new Europe and they bought it upon themselves.
It's probably going to get replaced by a mosque.
Bye Bye Paris! Welcome Paristan!
This great building has been around for 1000 years. It has seen Vikings, Crusaders, Revolutions & survived two World Wars but is destroyed during peace time during Holy Week. Talk about irony. 

I'm betting that the fire was started by a dum ass tourist smoking where they shouldn't have.
How did it start
Where is quasimodo please help him 😭🚒
Go Quasi Modo,  have a glass of wine and sing with Pariesians.
one word i want to say 活该
please donot forget hundred of years ago 
your 
fired the yuanmingyuan with other countries
We will rebuild Notre Dame everyone
Praying from Croatia
"Looking on in horror" while u hear laughing and cheering
Even the God is angry with mankind! Let's pray.
Holy cow CNN is ACTUALLY reporting NEWS?? And it is actually REAL? Not staged or lies???? Wow I NEVER thought i would see CNN get away from there lies about Trump NOT being spied on, when we ALL knew for two years that he was, and it was the result of Clinton's campaign paying Russian intelligence for the fake lying Dossier.  Hey CNN, have you enjoyed the financial gain from the Orteg intelligence agencies propaganda fund that Obama set up for you and MSNBC to try to bring down our great president? And CNN why aren't you guys happy that Trump is willing to give your sanctuary cities the illegal immigrants you all say are SO MUCH better than us Americans? Now your saying that's not safe?? Ohhh, so you want them just not in YOUR cities, ok gotcha.  Hypocrites, Trump called your bluffs BIG TIME you treasonous lying losers. How about you stop brainwashing and dividing our fellow liberal Americans so we can get back to being a country.  It's so obvious to half the country your part of a cover up process for all the crooked pricks that Are being investigated now!!! No collusion, and you CANNOT obstruct something you NEVER did, so put that away.  Let's see how many of you are involved in criminal propaganda against the American liberals that dont realize what's going on yet,, you dispicable cowards.
Is the hunchback ok?
Such an amazing place destroyed. It must be restored.
Well, burning Notre Dame & the fall of the spire have officially guaranteed France & The Vatican that they will be super super rich within the next 24 hours. Congratulations to you both!
Even though I have never been there I have always dreamed of going to see the Norte Dame to see its true beauty. My heart is in pieces. From America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 [ Also... do you guys think it’s a coincidence that on the exact same day a church was burned by a communist???]
My God there’s people dying in the world millions kids killed in the  womb , and this building Hoggs all news every minute , 
yes it’s a beautiful building with history , but my goodness it’s only a F building , yes let it be in news and give it the time it deserves , but my goodness you would think twin towers had just happened  or the queen had died or 
summit , please put things in perspective 
Sorry for the building , but please give it a rest
So ... France thought receiving hundreds of thousands of people from Muslim and African countries would be a good idea...
First the influx of immigrants and now the cathedral. Europe is losing its culture. :(
The catholic church is satanic and completely evil! So glad it burned!
This is the punishment of God who worships idols or sanctifies them
So is this part of what Ragnar meant with his larger and bolder strategy?
the collapse of the cathedral's iconic spire is the sign of the abandonment of Christianity ... let's go back, brothers, before it's too late!
Sad! Part of my childhood😮 who has not seen the bellringer of notre dame 1995?.
A 800 year old church burns everyone is in tears. Burn a rainforest that stood for a millennia and noone bats an eye.
This is the great God's punishment of the English boar! This is the fire of righteousness from our great believers, and in a few days, we will continue to set fire to the fires of righteousness throughout Europe! Burn all over the world!
This survived two world wars . May be nature's way of telling that just like this church Western Civilization is going to pushed into the fire.
Though this is off topic, Sunday will be the 20th anniversary of the Columbine Shooting😢I hope that all schools will remain safe next week.🤞🤞🇺🇸 - HS Senior

Thy will be done🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Yay! im happy it burnt down.
Norter dame: breaths
God : HIPPITY HOPPITY YOUR NOW MY PROPERTY
Oh my god, Russian people crying, unbelievable sad! Be strong France!
Soon all churches will be burned down  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏
need some water bombers they could hit it multiple times  maybe they dont have many forest fires there not sure
i'm a christian . C'mon Paris, we all stay side by side with you - from Hawaii
Omg, where tf is the hunchback gonna live ?
The amount of people who are using this tragic incident to push their far-right agendas proves why all hope for humanity is lost. Instead of being sad about the loss itself, they use it as an excuse to hate others. It shows how little they truly care about their culture that they are supposedly defending.
The burning of Notre Dame, is exactly one month after the 15 March 2019 ‘Christchurch New Zealand mosque massacre’ … and in France which is approximately 10% (or slightly more) Muslim, it is quite possible, that one or more of the many renovation workers who were in Notre Dame before the fire, were Muslim.
Not to worry. It will not take CNN long to find a way to turn it into a racial event and blame it on Trump..
Terrible, what were they storing in there ? Looked like petrol?
Этому президенту бошку оторвать !!!!! Останется в истории только тем, что при нём был уничтожен мировой архитектурный и исторический шедевр !!!!!!💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 Вполне возможно и скорее всего так, что это умышленный поджог и очередной протест против проводимой жесткой политики Макрона-макарона (((((( 👿👿👿👿 Лучше б они Макарона яйцами тухлыми закидали !!!!! 👿👿👿👿👿👿
Oh well.....
Let's do a crowd funding to restore it.
It is very sad but maybe it was God's will.
I am telling you now. Someone better call the Belmonts! Jokes aside, this really sux
BURN, BURN IT DOWN!!
How fitting 4 frances demise.
I hope Quasi got out
Worse things than churches that can burn, what if it was a nuclear power station... PERSPECTIVE
I was literally there so sad I was watching it burn down now in Paris hostel shook from this
Seriously, this is heartbreaking... The cathedral burning and collapsing... just like Europe's faith and identity... Wake up Europe!!!
4 september 476   ...Destruction of Roma...end of the Roman empire

15 april 2019 ...Notre-Dame burns  ...beginning of the end of western  civilization
GOD BLESS YOU
Hell fire
Dark fire
This fire in my skin
This burning

Is turning me to sin
The roof is on fire let that mothafucca burn burn mothafucca burn...... to soon??? @scamaway
I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that this was not an accident. America is praying with you. Bless you France, I’m praying for all of you.
Fell bad for the hutchback 😂😂😂😂
I hope Quasimodo and the gorgyles survived the fire. 😭😭😭💔💔💔
The spire was for aether collecting free energy. Of course they burnt it down.
圆明园 were destroyed by Franch and Englishmen in the 1860
Danm wish for the best! I was just there got back Saturday 😟😭
kwazimodo woz ere 2019 !
It is really painful. Love from Oman.
God of mercy
So to all the 911 people concrete an steel can go down in fire
Today, we are all French.
I wonder how the World Trade Center could collapse sooner than an 800 year old building in fire.
I hope Quasimodo is ok.
Quasimodo’s fault honestly
God has spoken !
what an unbelievable tragedy
good news...Quasimodo is staying in a 2 bed hostel in Montmatre...a bed for him and a bed for his hump..
I feel very sorry for what happened in France. but I can not avoid seeing that there are entrepreneurs who are going to donate many millions of Euros for their reconstruction. It gives me much more grief that this money is not used to help people. To make donations for people who can do micro-enterprises and do not have the capital to do so. As my case, I work since I was 9 years old. I work but I have not had the luck to be born with money. to have my own business.
if someone wants to give me help to grow. I'm not as important as a cathedral. but I can generate jobs.

Freemason/Illuminati ritual burn. Church going down in decay.
This same scene was portrayed in I pet goat 2🤔
To make it so hot, pour the oil tank inside the building. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
To the dishonest CNN staff: this building is burnt, but God's troops have been rallied..and you know what that means!
NFT ... NIGGAS FOR TRUMP
Import the third world. Become the third world.
- A symbol of Paris ❤
- A heritage for unanimity❤
- A  source of inspiration for musical and cartoons ❤
- A source of true art ❤

Another piece of history gone in time.


Our thoughts go towards Paris & their people in this time of great mournful loss.
SAME AS 9-11 RENOVATIONS THAT TOOK THE TOWERS DOWN - HMMMMM
Catholic church is starting to run out of money...?
Mourn for the art treasure, but not for the France. The collapse showed French did not deserve to have such a pearl.
CNN is fake news
2018-2019 has been hard for everyone.. that's horrible that this happened
Seeing this is heartbreaking, but it makes me think God sacrificed this beautiful historical symbol of European culture and tradition to remind the French and Europeans that you have the most incredible, beautiful culture and history of this world. Do not let your countries be invaded and your people be outbred out of existance, European people!! Otherwise, all of Europe's churches will be burning or turned into mosques if you do not wake up, and do so quick.
The Russians probably set the fire for their political games and 
interference, Putin already wants to send in a team of spies go 
figure...
Why didn’t God save it? Was he out?
Definitly the French WTC
All the Paintings and Antiquities that will be lost, the amount of history in the Cathedral.
It’s a sad day in french history. I hope everyone stays safe. Sending love and prayers 💔😱😢
Who else came here thinking it was the vampire's castle and got disappointed it wasn't?
Act of God! 
Clearly 13 million visitors per year was not enough to keep him happy!
what aren't you telling us CNN????   Ill find out...…..somewhere else
What the #$%* started the fire? 😤
I can see Ilhan Omar's grin from here.
Muslims did this, and Jews are celebrating.
Maybe this multicultural utopia isn't going to happen?
this is a sign of western civilzation's brink of collapse. the pynical of western culture fell.
And the E.U will fall.
What caused this fire?  We all have the same suspicions, I'm sure.
Happy i visited before it caught on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
It's  TRUMPS FAULT!
The only time that the media has given a true story, though mixed, the event true, but confused over other things
When they conquered Constantinople they burned the Haga Sophia.  When they took over Russia they burned the Church of Christ the Redeemer.  Now this.
Who gives a Dame!
Such a disaster and no helicopters to help stopping the fire? At least I guess it would be helpful.
Who started it? How did it start?
Condolences to Paris from Joinville Brazil
Looks like some people did something.
I will build it back with concrete structure .fireproof.less wood material only where necessary"ring out the old bring in the new
Without Apostles there isn't Church.
Luckily all is not completely lost, enough left to restore some things
God Bless the dead
Hopefully it will be rebuilt faster than the rebuild of the Frauenkirche in Dresden.
Guys chill. The church itself survived, it was only the roof end the spire that collapsed, which will obviously be reconstructed. I mean the building is made of stone so it would literally be impossible to burn it down.
Heres a crazy idea. Insurance wil cover damage. If u rebuild it, its just a copy of the original. People hav donated a billion$ 2 rebuild. How about takin that billion and building 75000 tiny houses 4 homeless and poor. Dont people living now matter than a building.    Buildings r meant 2 come and go.
While you all feel sorry for Notre-Dame and the French people remember that the whole earth is currently burning for years now and it’s getting hotter every day
Feeling sad from New Mexico!😢😭
this girl is on fireeeeee this girl is on fireeeeeoeeeaaaa
So that was "gods house". Doesent that mean that it's gods house that actually kills polar bears :'(
Allah burn it down .
9/11 Taught us that metal burns and melts because of fire,? Why is the 
Scaffolding standing? Is anyone waking up???????????  "I Pet Goat" said
 it was coming down, BEFORE it happened!
Please, it's not what one sees, it's what we don't.  This needs to be investigated. A 9/11 only to draw people together
When government is weakening
 Fight on YELLOW VEST
I’m starting a kickstarter campaign to raise funds to build a new home for Quasimodo.
Just a building. Nothing interesting.
ISIS attack.
Sharia Law ....
Crusades anyone?
why did this have to happen...
Their NWO God, a talking burning bush fire, has taken the building.

Force for France
Did the Hunchback get fired? I smell disgruntled arson.
Damn how does dis happen? 
    Viva la france!
    Viva la france!
Our God is a Jealous God. He uses people to deliver his messages. 

 He also works in mysterious ways, and this is possibly a sign.  He will take his churches,  so much sin, malice and he knows that the churches are not doing anything. Boy's wanna be  Girls and Girls wanna be Boys. 

 The signs are Clear.
dia de luto mundial en todo corazon catolico.... compartimos el dolor junto a cualquier frances desde mexico.
Oh my gosh...
All the atheist at CNN are celebrating.
"Quick save the alter boys?" The priest yelled.
BOG SVE GLEDA! 1999 STE PALILI NASE HRAMOVE!!!
Here in France, many happyness reactions of muslims...
So CNN? Any updates on the yellow vests?
Does this mean the Disney live-action remake is cancelled?
Always wanted to go there. To sad that its going down. Such a symbol for the city and the history of Paris.
Might as well put up a mosque in its place.
Wish I could see it before it burned down.. You can visit it after they rebuild it but it's not the same... You just can see a copy.
It was clearly detonated!!
Black metal right there
I went to Paris and didn’t see it because I was planning to go again in the future...
Force France
Just goes to show that if you ever have the opportunity to travel, do it.  See as much as you possibly can in this lifetime, because irreplaceable works of art can be destroyed in a moment's notice, never to be seen again, sometimes with no explanation as to why.
Wow.
:(
PrayforParis
Stay strong France! From Serbia🇷🇸🇫🇷
Le Mexique vous soutient France force France💪
INSHALLAH! Christianity is dying in the kaffir lands. Heed what Allah is showing you here.
Feels like 9/11. Having flashbacks
Support Paris comments are coming
RIP Notredame been there for centuries 13 million tourist every year Visit survived so many wars and catastrophes France hundred attacks on on churches lately and no media has reported on those attacks...why??                        
 RIP Notredame 1260-2019
Aww shiet some hunchbacks are out of a home.
I am still wondering why CNN is still not collapsing after so many fake news?!
Do we know if it’s a terrorist attack? This is so sad.😭
If it was 9/11 it woulda fell by now and taken down some surrounding buildings
false flag, distraction.
it's either a Muslim guy or a Atheist, since the Easter holiday was last Friday.

HAHAHHAAHAHA
# team française je suis vraiment toucher parce qu'il c'est passer ....
This was built in 1163. For hundreds of years it stood, and now it burns to the ground. 

There is something living amongst us that is incompatible with civilization. Something is holding us back.
I thought notre dame only collapses later on during the season?
You cannot be serious... unprecedented. A similar sacle would be the destruction of  the Kaaba in Mecca or Bodh Gaya of Buddhism. Dear God...
M U S L I M S
Hope Quasimodo and the gargoyles are ok.
Thoughts are with those in Paris and France from the the UK.  Such a heartbreaking 💔 moment to watch the world famous iconic spire fall and disappear beneath the smoke never to be seen the way it was again.
Matthew 27:50-51: "And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom."
Praise JAH
MAGA 2020
I JUST HEARD THIS WAS CROATIANS THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE OVER A SOCCER PLAYER DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THATS TRUE??
Mexico supports you France
This is not the first time a fire has burned the Notre Dame cathedral.  The cathedral has been burned and rebuilt and restored over the centuries like during the French revolution or during the Paris Commune. 
It will be rebuilt.
Le Mexique vous soutient France force France💪
Not so multiculteral now, probably celibrating in their holes in outer Paris
What No Trump News!!!!! HALLELUJAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(That's awful! 😥

Damn it Frollo! Why were you singing in front of the fireplace again?)
The questions is had to be is how did the fire start? Was it accidental or deliberately done?
Was it because of the illegal immigrants? Or an arsonist?
So many questions needs to be answered.
Quasimodo: Am I a joke to you?
The muslims did it
Belle soudure, François. Oops!
00:47 lmao but really sad..
This is sad Pray that it is good now
Sign of end times.
I have no words for this...

Où que nous soyons, nous nous souvenons de nos racines.
Such a tragic event
omggggggg I don live there but I’ve been to Paris before and I got to WALK around Notre Dame 😢
5 G  = judgement on the kabalistic tree.... judgement will begin in the house of god.
Payback?
This will be remembered as a terrible day in history.
Hellfire Citadel
"And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt (CATHOLICS, which have killed and oppressed multitudes of Christians, and follow the traditions of MEN rather than the truth of the BIBLE) ...He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire."
Isaiah 43:12a,13
Musliums better pray to Allah that a muslium is not found responsible for this. That will be the end of it. Though to be honest dozens of churches have been burned in Europe over the last 2 years and no one seems to care. I guess its because they didn't hear about it on the news.
how did the fire start this is horrible
Coincidence. I think not
LOL they don't care about the demographic disaster and a criminal Prime Minister, but a spire...let's all hold hands.
Notre Dame was an inside job
We can be HAPPY that quite the complete works of Bach and Palestrina and Dufay are still there. And that people will certainly reflect more about early christianity and threats to other masterpieces of western civilization. Anyway, that is still to cry.
Revelation 18:2! THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!  Bible Prophecy Shows that ALL False Religion Will Fall! Very Soon! Worldwide!
I’m not a French but I’m crying, I’m too emotional or I don’t know but I’m really sharing your pain ❤️ stay strong France 🇫🇷
Peace for Paris from the us
1:04 that dab tho
Happy Easter.
Why did none of our teachers tell us this was happening
the crown of thorns worn by jesus was in there.
Damn Trump .......it's all his fault !!!!!!!
Ok
Wake up, they are Burning EVIDENCE !
It has a sad symbolism - ♪ time to say goodbye ♫
Ughhh!! This isn’t okay! Okay so I’m a HUGE history nerd and I pretty much cried over this beacause it’s history! And it’s an old piece of history too and it’s just so sad to see this happen 😞
erdogans revange
Who are you praying to? The God who's watching it happen and doing nothing?
Did CNN get this story right or are they adding in their lies again?
Reminds me of when America and England bombed all the great cities of Germany to smithereens, along with their innocent women and children, and incredible, irreplaceable  architectural, design, engineering and art treasures.
Ironic and fishy gotta be honest. In a time of quite decent peace during holy week this happens to the side of the church
Very unimpressed with two things: 1. The passive fire prevention devices and procedures that Notre Dame had; a place so valuable, artistically, culturally and religiously, built 800 years ago, almost completely with highly flammable materials, and visited by thousands of persons every day definitely required better prevention. 2. The ability and equipment of Paris fire fighters who did not even had telescopic ladders tall enough to reach the roof they desperately needed to. We could see on TV how their waterjets could hardly reach the lateral walls while the roof was starting to catch the fire, and making it wet would have delayed it. If water is spayed from the distance straight to the flames, it evaporates before even reaching the structures.
Muslim's erasing 1000 years of french history and art
on facebook, the amount of muslims leaving happy faces and clapping is disgusting
I visited it roughly 10 years ago.. a beautiful piece of architecture both inside and out. This is not an accident. It was completed in 1345 and was virtually untouched for 600+ years, that includes two brutal wars in Europe and now all of a sudden the wood may be a problem. This is clearly nothing more than a method to keep the protesting French citizens occupied with something else. What better way to keep people off the street than by inducing a form of national mourning? Be it a person, or building. Welcome to 1984 folks. We're living it.
If this didn't prove to be islamic terrorism, I'd be very surprised.
Just rebuild it👍
its sooo Beautiful
Love from the USA. I never went to Paris, but I hope y’all will be able to preserve some parts of the cathedral
出来混总是要还的 活该啊巴黎
Gods wrath
Dammit, this must be the work of....
Actually... 








I don't care
sou do Brasil,Cristão e percebi que aos poucos a história da humanidade está se acabando, tudo começou com o nosso Palácio Imperial , cujo nome que deram ( MUSEU NACIONAL) hoje veio Notre Dame , muito triste com isso, não quero está aqui nesse mundo quando destruírem a Bíblia, nossa principal história.
My condolence to the families of those who lost their lives. So sad to watch😥😥😥🙏🙏🙏🇱🇷🇱🇷
Prayers from United States
esto es obra de amlo
The worst day since 9/11.
What a joke fire services are today. The entire emergency-response field needs an Elon Musk.  Its a contained FIRE and they can't put it out in 2019!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHH!!! Its not a forest fire, too pathetic.. water!! HAHAHAHAH they are using water in 2019!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH OMG The west is so lost.
...if this isnt a bad omen I dont know what is

it is the evil men hands on this very well prepared "accident"
CNN this is a example of REAL News-
Prayers from the Philippines
Don't blame the yellow vesters
Quite sad to see the spire fall. I went a few years ago and it was quite the sight.
Prayers for France from Michigan USA.
Very sad. Was there just 2 weeks ago!
I get home from school to here that Notra dame is on fire and I turn on the news to watch the spirer fall and I said I wanted to go see
I wonder how they’ll blame Trump for this
France should immediately fireproof its other iconic cathedral at Chartres.  Superior French artistic skill and technological sophistication will ensure that whatever rises from the ashes will be  both breathtaking and fireproof.
Que triste!
...And 6 Million + Muslims living in France are elated...kinda like they were on 9/11.
So sad wwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
This is a horrible world tragedy. We lost an 850 year old piece of history that built humanity, built by humanity
How dare you have ads on this video
let's hope it didn't burn from praying too much
Meh the twin towers fell and people learn to move on soooooo yeah. Still suck for it to fall
I get home from school to here that Notra dame is on fire and I turn on the news to watch the spirer fall and I said I wanted to go see
On the other side Israel is destroying Daily and slowly a very old church ( al qiyama) in Jerusalem which is older than notre dame in France and nobody knows about it 
Hypocrite muthefuking world
This is very tragic. An almost 1000 year old landmark like this is irreplaceable.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
This is WAR
Prayers from Finland. Sad to see such a beautiful historic building burning down.
This is terrible and tragic, let's hope there is no loss of life and all tourists and people who were working there evacuated safely.  A truly tragic turn of a terrible accident.
Perhaps an adverse religious group did this.
Who cares
Probably Muslims set it on fire
Terrorist attack.
It's good. It was never meant for white people. All churches should be burned down. Christianity is not a French religion.
How sad,,, didn't the communists burn books. Yellow vests, it's more than people are thinking of. A set fire, Wake up world,  love, life, empathy, is not what you think or feel.
keep the faith christians!
no planes to drop water off from the top?
I feel like this wasn’t an “accident” anyone else? I mean hasn’t France gone through enough? This is just way too low if it isn’t an accident. I mean so many years this building has gone through and wars and hasn’t been damaged and suddenly a fire makes it fall... kinda suspicious. 🙏🏻🙏🏻 I pray to France 🇫🇷
The church that supported colonialism and slavery has finally met its faith.  Amen !   Ave Maria !
Look at the most high working setting up for the Israelites to be in our rightful place
did they get Quasimodo out in time  ???
Heartbreaking
A piece of history just came crashing down, even more tragic as it's Holy Week.
Right after Palm Sunday.
Old lady and guardian of Paris. To see her in flames. It breaks my heart.
R.I.P Quasimodo
Watch I pet goat II ....the cathedral scene at the end ....come back here and comment if you see similarity...your mind will be blown away....this was no accident.
Muslim people did this,It's all part of the plan.....
It's been targeted for awhile now by extremists, it was only a matter of time. One church got burnt a month ago in france
Really sad... 😔
I can’t believe nobody died/got injured
What a coincidence during holy week
How awful. I'm not a religious person, but watching this 800+ year old work of art (and full of art) burning to the ground is emotionally devastating.
Usa 🚀🚀🚀 france
France should pay for that co2!
Not Islam again....
We all know who did this. Hundreds of churches across france have been vandalised before today. Europe needs to get rid of the vile cancer spreading its shores now. Time for another crusade...
This is one huge profound sign of Jesus's return, just a taste of what is to come.
No doubt the Islamists are behind this and are celebrating. This is an epic symbol and turning point in the ongoing subjugation of France an d western Europe to the insidious invasion of and conquest by the aggressive supremacist Islamist imperialist colonialists. Saudis will pay to rebuild Notre Dame as a grand mosque. There's no France anymore! France died with a whimper.
hey cnn fake news and enemy of the people.   you don't see any muslims out helping to put out the fire,  wonder why,   invite them in mass into your country and this is the 3rd huge church fire now,   and Ramadan is may 6
Yeah get the marshmallows out boys but first save quasimoto
Quasimodo get along hahahhaahahahahah
Orange man bad
Stop reporting real issues and talk about orange man
the church of harlot and abomination the roman catholic church is currently punished.
Rip Quasimodo
I wonder if this happened because "some people did something!"
Who even cares?? Woohoo some old building caught fire ...What are about about the thousands of millions of people who have perished, away with their families? (E.g. Palestine, Iran , Syria, Gaza, Burma etcetera)
It’s a sad day but the Vatican’s supposedly worth $30billion or more & has assets of $764million & $20million in gold reserves. Let them dip their hands into the coffers to rebuild it. It’ll provide many much needed jobs. Several completely gutted buildings in the UK have been completely rebuilt & so it is completely feasible.
Praying from  Portugal
The scientology HQ should've burned down instead of this
To those who are distraught: Remember the times you watched a documentary which said "In this year the building burnt down and it was reconstructed again". This happens. This 'has' happened in the past to many historic sites which will be restored as new. The site isn't lost unless the government gives up on it and I doubt that they will. Chin up. This was an accident, keep the faith strong and spread strength, love and reassurance during times of turmoil and times of peace.
:( why?
It survived. Just gonna put that out there.
They will build a Mosque in its place
C’est vraiment triste 😔
Prayers from New York. It's so sad to see such a historical building burn. Such a beautiful building such a sad situation. I wonder what the cause was to burn something since the 12th century. I hope not terrorism. It stood this long what could have happened
Wonder how Fake News CNN will try to blame President Trump for this.
Truly a beautiful building, I have no clue how that fire started but it’s such a shame
The religion of “peace and love” behind this for sure. ..Anyone that thinks muslims will coexist does not know anything about Islam.
Where are the helicopters with water buckets
Hope the Vatican catches fire soon....
Trump's backers, the extreme right, sent Bannon to Rome to attack the Pope. Catholics need to remember this.
it's just a building
This ACT OF ARSON isn't going to unite the people of France.
Decline Christianity in France? They asked for it? They spend 180 years for build it, from XII Century. What did they done?
There is a hope , hope that   the Cathedral   will be saved ,restored and visited by millions - year after year.
6:20 "it's pretty chaotic here." No it is not. When the police tells you to move, you move!
Good riddance
Fallen Fallen is Babylon the great!
Global warming...
I was there 2 hours ago when that happend
My goodness, the beauty of the streets of Paris today has become something out of a war. It's so sad to see such a beautiful city become so crumbling.
Lets see how quick the Vatican is to put their hands in their pocket to help finance the restoration - because it CAN be restored, they did a great job on Windsor Castle.
Governments are always brow beating everyone else about Fire Safety and complying with regulations. Well you messed up big time on this one.
If I remember correctly, left-wingers hate religion.
It’s heartbreaking but not as the twin towers
For me it might be a terroristic attack. if it is i hope tha meca will colapse forever.
to vas bog kaznjava smradovi jel ste kacili zastavu kosova muslimanske teroristicke mafijaske drzave ako nek izgori dabogda i vi svi goreli u paklu idioti glupi
Ahhh, the false flag that the globalists need and orchestrates to offset the mueller report release!. It won't work traitors, America is too much awakened!.
I literally think that this is Arson. Someone caused this, either terrorists or some random person.
I’d wager that some of the Muslim “refugees” set this. However if so , they will quickly cover it up. 
DEUS VULT
That's all they have to fight that fire?
Liberals, democrats, and muslims are currently laughing and celebrating this together.
Very sad😞 🙈😔 I visited this beautiful cathedral many years ago   I , hope no injured people there!
God bless France🙏🏼
Either before or at the time of the JEWISH Messiah's return, the Vatican will crumble as well. Forget about His HUMAN mommy. He is the truth , the way, and the life. He is the Afikomen and Cup of Redemption in the Passover. Try reading Revelation 17.
Hmm, a tragic event happens to Europeans, most people pay condolences but whenever something bad happens to non-Europeans, they deserved it? 🤔
RIP Quasimodo
The beginning of the end for western Europe.
Holy Smokes!!
Pet goat 2
Symbolic of Europe really.
Somebody know why there was fire?
This is God's way of saying he's disappointed in the church
Beautiful building,but where's this God when you need him?...day off?
My Heart aches to see this happen. My Thoughts and Prayers go out to Paris. Such Art and History up in flames. Sad, just so Sad.
Thoughts and prayers from  Croatia.
Notre Dame dans mon Coeur

Wiem, że pod tym komentarzem pojawi się wiele hejtu, ale mają to na co pozwolili... niestety.
I’m French and this hurts me so bad..
LIKE FIRE HELL FIRE THIS FIRE IN MY VEINS
İ am a muslim person and when I see this I felt like crying 
This is just sad. 😥😥🥺🥺
People are so innocent. MUSLIMS are standing behind this fire which occur 'suddenly' in this famous building which is presenting the past of Christianity. Now you'll get a mosque instead. Silly world silly France people who welcoming ISlam among them
People wake up!
This was no accident!
Look up in the sky, it's a bird. it's a plane.. it's a mild mannered aerospace engineer by day, masked fire fighter at night ... It's tariff man !  And who, cleverly disguised as POTUS fights a never ending battle for truth, justice and cheating on his income taxes !
You people will not say what actually happened will you.  It was an attack by certain people that are highly violent reminds me of 9/11 I wonder....
Anonymous sources say that they saw a short man with jiggly booobs that looked like Brain Stelter running from the scene !!! Bong Bong Bong !!!
LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE LINKS TO PROPHECYS MAYBE NOSTRADAMUS FROM THIS ONE EVENT
Rip Quasimodo we will remember you
Prayers from the U.S
God Dammit Charizard
damn...this is depressing...A monument like this, lost in time...
America is with you 🇺🇸🇫🇷
And to think Emanual Macron wants to rebuild it to 'Frances new  diverse standard' and the mayor of france wants to turn it into a mosque
🙏🏻😭💔
I didn't know this building existed before this fire accident. So...is it like...kind of big deal or something?
This is so heartbreaking.  Consider the people who have walked the halls over the past 600+ years.  The artwork and symbol of peace.. The world feels your loss.  Peace and prayers for the people of Paris and France.  Namaste.
so so so sad
💔💔💔
This is so painful to watch..😭... I'm so sad...
It was reported that thousands of child molestation was done there ...and it was targeted many times...I am just writing what the news said ..please don't blame me !! Very very sad to see a historical place gone..
They burn it down themselves... Evidences of child abuse destroyed
I agree with  President Trump.  I believe that they should have had planes drop water on the Cathedral - hours ago.  Macron, a political opponent of Trump, was too quick to say no, that it would make the whole structure collapse.  Well,  common sense tells me that when you have a fire raging, they should have gauged how much water should have been dropped.  I believe that water certainly would have been better than allowing the fire to destroy this incredible landmark.  A huge piece of history has died today.  It's devastating  :(.
Als het stof doorgoten is tot vastigheid, en de kluiten samenkleven?
This is almost symbolic. It represents the collapse of European culture and art over the past decade.
