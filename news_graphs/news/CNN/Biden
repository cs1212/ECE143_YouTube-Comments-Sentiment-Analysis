Biden/Avenatti 2020
“MakeAmericaCreepyAgain”
Creepy Uncle Joe Biden wants four more years of hair sniffing and fondling children. No thanks.
When your candidacy is contingent on opposing someone else instead of advocating for your own platform, you're going to lose (see: Hillary).
CNN salivating over corporate shill Biden. You would've thought it?
Lol, Good luck with that! What a clown show... CNN is a total joke!
You know you messed up as a country when a pedophile starts running for president and it even looks good for them.
"It's an exciting moment here on the set " CNN your bias shows
As a lifelong Democrat, I will absolutely not be voting for him.
They call it The American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
And trump is a liar? Lol ok sure.
These people are fuckng demons and are going down.
CNN pushing their establisment pick...no thank you, GO FORK YOURSELF!
Biden: "I fight for the idea of America, not the reality of it."
Joe is Running on a Platform of MSM Hatred....    No suprise really...  YUCK!
Demonstrations attract many people. Many are innocent persons. Not all were extreme. That's what Trump said. Trump has condemned the violence. Is that so difficult to understand?
so cringy, even with the emotional music. creepy joe gotta go!
Bye-done. Enough said. Waste of time.
Lol Joe saving us from the KKK
Biden might as well of just come on and said "orange man bad".
Wow big surprise his video is nothing but pandering nonsense.
Remember Joe Biden is an Establishment guy who introduced the crime bill by selling 1. Don’t fix the problem 
2. They have no conscious 
3. They have no parents 
4. They are PREDATORS 
5. Beyond Pale
6.  “Those People”
7. We don’t know how to rehabilitate 
8. I don’t care why 
Would he say this about those suffering from the Opioid Epidemic as he did for the Crack Epidemic? 
Biden supporters have no room to point out Bernie's age now.
Biden thinks of the Declaration of Independence as cliche? I get chills every time
"Im against bad things." Thats good Joe but what are you running on?
A better name for this segment would have been how to platitude circle jerk 101
Joe "the Groping Sniffer" Biden. Make groping kids great again!
Kinda cringing at CNN creaming themselves over Biden's announcement.
Just what the republic needs. Another establishment Democratic politician . Ya Trump will be re elected.
The irony is that if Thomas Jefferson were around, Biden would be calling him the same epithets that he calls traditional americans in this video.
I like how the comments are opposing 😂🤧
Biden said they want to put ya'll back in chains. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I see he is still race baiting as he announces his loss 😂😂😂😂😂
Joe Biden's wife: I didn't have the courage to stand up and say anything about Joe's advances 20 years ago. 

Democrats: Joe Biden 2020!
Biden's speech was so... touching.
Common man Joe. The guy that laundered a billion dollars to his sons company through the ukraine. Just a common man.
BREAKING: Joe Biden calls America 'a cliché'.
Ahhh, Biden. A fresh breath of stale air.
Recites the Declaration 
"It's who we are, Vote for me"
The divided Democratic Party is on a course to defeat itself again.
CNNs only news is either propping up corrupt looney left candidates or bashing Trump
Oh yeah platitudes...that will work the establishment gets it...😂
Well, Biden is running on race. And the adorning faces of the CNN rats was sickening because they are usually snarling at Trump.
Great, the Democrats have a ton of great candidates and choose an old Pedophile.
Why tf are they smiling for joe so much??? I think the fix is in.... Bernie 2020
"I'm gonna be as vague as possible about racism to get around the fact that I actually have a pretty terrible track record in regard to issues surrounding race."
Biden has no policy, just empty platitudes. Bernie 2020.
"Moral Core"... From the guy that extorted the President of Ukraine to fire his own Godson to protect Biden's Son's crimes?
The Kids are scared, they're all hidin 

There's a knock at the door, it's creepy Joe Biden
Give the man a tissue to wipe the verbal diarrhoea from his chin
Joe Biden is a loser on arrival
if you want to stop the KKK all you got to do is stop the  Democratic party. It's a known fact Democrats were slave owners just look up history
In 2020 Trump is gonna grab Biden by the 🐱.
You will not replace us! 🇺🇸
Manipulates trumps comment. Why don't you show the full clip Joe FAIL
Trump already has a nickname for Biden .Sleepy Joe but I know he will want to change that to creepy Joe.
Experience. Like. The iran deal. Ok
Creepy groper Joe being creepier then ever. 😂
ERROR ERROR no valid argument avaliable...... ORANGE MAN BAD
So Uncle Touch Too Much is formally running. Wonderful.
James Allsup made a video about his campaign and honestly THANK YOU JAMES
A desperate party
On an appalling mission
Seeking the impossible. 
Please !
Clark Griswold is running for President?
But wait, wait, fake news polls says creepy, corrupt, slow, uncle joe is up 20+ on Bernie, and 10+ on Trump. LOL 🤣😂🤣🇺🇸KAG2020
So Biden was pro segregation and then announces his campaign by lecturing us about racism? Anyone else find that a tad hypocritical?
His platform would consist of reaching out to women voters in the most creepiest way.
CNN: "wow biden has so much experience"
also CNN: "wow bernie is just way too old, experience doesn't matter, we need young people"
"Biden asked Obama not to endorse him"?? Yeah right... Biden is a pervert and that going to come out big time.
National beat up a democrat day
Western Media = God = Always right and cannot be challenged. Ha ha ha!
Creepy Joe Biden couldn't even beat his own meat let alone beat President Trump. 😭😭
I don't know why he bothered with the time and expense of a campaign launch video when all he had to do was tell CNN he was jumping into the race and let you mannequins gleefully produce an anmouncement video for him, poorly disguised as a news segment.
If shouting “ lock her up “ was bad , imagine 
“ creepy jeo “
The world will watching.
"i like to grab them by the shoulders and smell them by the hair, and if you re a famous politician they let you get away with it" - not Trump ;)
And from the great state of Delaware, an over the hill deep state alumni, with extensive hair smelling skills, the fabulous Joe Doe-
errr-I mean Biden
When did Antifa thugs become a "courageous group of Americans?"
Somehow “We need to remember who we are” seems like an ironic slogan for an old man. I wonder what else he tends to forget. Oh yeah, his record.
Go away Joe!!!! You are hillary 2.0 and will make Trump president again.
Sleepy.. Creepy..
This is how you loose to trump 🤦‍♂️
Democrat 2020 policies: Orange man bad and White Supremacy is taking over the world.
Creepy Biden 100% corporatist. blah blah blah blah blah, we know your history next.
centrists: trump is racist 
also centrists: fight fire with fire, no need for 'socialism'

bidens campaign: N
8:13 the only thing Biden feels is the women he s touching against their will
I didn't hear any policies mentioned in his video....
By stealing votes from Bernie #DropOutJoe
Biden you lost HOW many times before .Good luck  creepy Joe.
The eyes say it all, demon(s) in the flesh!
His ad is nothing but a melodramatic announcement.
The video was pitch perfect. Far from being"stark", I exuded a tone of urgency necessary to combat the machinery that is grinding us into complacency.
look at that like/dislike ratio. y'all are screeeewed.
Thanks for wasting my 10 minutes of my life to see the corporate democrats pick
Firefighters for Joe!!
Joe Biden is acting like he descended from heaven to saves us from the evilness of Trump! 😂😂😂😂 oh boy, this guy is going to lose.
Fake polls. CNN and MSNBC are corporate democrats pushing this sleepy and handsy old fool. He will get Trump elected again.
Trump  2020 🇺🇸🙂✌️❤️
creepy Joe will get devour by his own party🤣
Biden IS THE NPC candidate 😂
Who cares, go away creep
Trump 2020.
HOW ABOUT.   NO MORE CAREER  SLIMEY POLITICIANS LIKE CREEPY JOE ?)))
Joe Biden is such a fraud, what a gong show
Joe wants the Antifa vote 🤡
"Biden rebukes Charlottesville response in campaign video"


HOLY CRAP GUYS, HE MET THE BARE MINIMUM! NEXT THING WE'LL HEAR HE'LL BE PRO-BLACK PEOPLE!
And for my campaign goals
- I oppose Trump......
A CHILD Molester For President?
Biden will continued what he have done for the 8 years he was a Vice President. NOTHING!
Biden is just so creepy! He also had a VERY CREEPY family.....Trump 2020 for sure!
CNN doesn’t care promoting someone whose been accused for sexual harassment even before they start the campaign lmaao. Like what?
He just wants to touch up all the kids 😂😂
Joe Biden, another PROGRESSIVE genius 🤣🥳🤣😂🤣😂😅😜😝😛🥳🥳🥳🥳👏👏👏👏👏🤪😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😋😝😝🥳🤣.
Easy win trump 2020
The fact that his campaign video is only uploaded on the CNN and ABC channels instead of Biden's own social media truly emphasizes how deep in the pocket of corporate media and other companies he is.
49 years in politics name one accomplishment, Grope Change 2020, guy has early onset Dementia, too old, moving on.
Biden / Major Pete 2020?!
Take a shot every time she blinks
BERNIE/TULSI 2020 LETS GOOOOO
Pedo Joe is a definite NO! this man cannot be trusted!!!!
Hey Joe! Ive got a great campaign slogan for you for 2020. 
KYHTY!!!! 

KEEP YOUR HANDS TO YOURSELF
Yay, another corporate creep! smh...🙄
Here's a short review of some of Biden's record and current positions...

He wrote and voted for the 1994 Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act.
He wrote and voted for the Patriot Act.
He voted to deregulate the big banks numerous times, including the repeal of Glass-Steagall.

He doesn't support Medicare For All. 
He supports tuition-free public college for up to four years.

Welcome to the race, uncle Joe!
404
Policy not found
Sleepy Creepy Uncle Joe😫
So why is his campaign donations being asked to send clipping of hair. That's sick Pop
3 minutes and no policies later...
Creepy Joe, jajajajajajaj can't wait for the 2020 debates. JAJAJAJA
A private fundraiser jajajajaja
🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ a forest of failure... thank God I woke up from this nonsense... smh.. either people are this stupid or CNN is this bad
I hope they steal the slot from Bernie again. It’s going to be funny watching them shoot themselves in the foot again. The fighting and crying, it’s going to be great.
Get back in the closet, bud!
Imagine if Kamala and Biden never step out of the race.  Bernie would have the nomination guaranteed.
Anthony Weiner/Joe Biden in 2020
"Racism Bad" Biden 2020
Repeating the same mistake Hillary did in 2016: Focusing TOO MUCH ON TRUMP RATHER THAN HIS OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS. Good night, Sleepy Joe.
What the hell?? Charlottesville is gonna be the focus of your opening campaign video??
Now I know why CNN has the lowest ratings among the “Newscasts”! Even a one the other fake News channels. Fox happens to have the highest ratings!
I just looked it up to confirm it!
Trump 2020! Let freedom keep ringing!!
Who told him the third time's a Charm?
Plugs!!!
If the democrats don't hold fair representative elections again for their front runner let's pray that history won't repeat itself in 2020
Still waiting for The Rock's 2020 announcement
Start with lies ends with a liar.
The battle will be won by Trump 2020.
Biden is a creepy gaffe machine.  
Seriously , the bozo has never accomplished anything in anyone's behalf - other than himself getting re-elected.
CNN is as giddy about Biden as Fox is about Trump 🤦🏻‍♂️
What are bidens policies?? There are NONE!!! We need younger guys in their late 30s 40s in the WH!! No more old farts.
There has to be a chapter in the book of Revelations that warns  us about this loser
This is the greatest thing that could happen for 2020!
Go home Joe  sure take the train if you want just get out !!!!!
So many closets so many skeletons.... media start your digging. I still remember Biden saying a good Serb is a dead Serb....
So what exactly is this supposed to be? 




"IM AgAInSt RaCIsm" 




Yeah like 95% of everyone in the country
Another jelly fish since 2008-2016,  Presidential candidate from Chinese Communist Party.
How can a Zionazi talk about Fascism and Nazi's. LOL!
So he couldn't be trusted with a speech without a rambling tangent. Already sick of his pre-recorded announcements.
Hey CNN why haven't you reported Kim Jong Un arrives in Russia?
😂
Arllette looks really excited.
If “Biden has the highest chances of defeating Trump”, then the democrats are in big trouble
No Joe! No way!
Yes sir! Run 🏃 Joe 2020
Antifa us a courageous  group of America. Good to know Mr vice
Still "LIE". Lol. He finally slipped up and said something honest.
This is great!  Go Joe!
His ad, it made me hate people again. Actually I'm joking but that's what I keep hearing, thanks Joe we are one step closer to a civil war 😁
for far worst. we will not give up who we are Joe. go home. the pattern is full. Sanders, Warren +17 more. you bring confusion from long before you were a huger
If creepy Joe wins the primary, I will vote for Trump.
Poor CNN...........You had nazi/Russian trolls for years and now you get Bernie trolls too.  Looks like neither one of them can handle real news.  lol
Nnaaaawww.. Im not really into this idea of Touchie Feelie grandpa who might be a habitual grabber..oh shit.. wait, I see the connection now LoL
I feel like watching a Memoriam. Bernie 2020
Hilarious “average joe”
America’s first openly proud Pedophile Presidential hopefull
Biden carries the water for credit card companies
this dude is a typical late 1970s national democrat.  He's got more in common with Romney than Warren.
Having a private fundraiser the day you announce. Great way to attract progressives.
Creepy uncle Joe 2020
Private fundraiser, jajajajaja
Joe shouldn't run he's just dividing the vote.
Creepy Uncle Joe kicks of his campaign with a hypocritical, SJW pandering video.
.
.
.
.
MAGA2020 in a landslide.
The party of baby killers, lawlessness lies and flies, truly it is the season of the witch, awake America the devil is at the door
And the creepy Joe meme begins!
Joe, we tried to warn you.  Our president will bury you, so like our president, I am going to enjoy watching.
Damn joe won already
Biden will certainly get the NAMBLA vote
Main stream news lies. Look at the Jimmy Dore Show on youtube.
My father went to law school with this fool!  In the same class.  Before he died he said Joe Biden cheated his way through school.  My father has his name engraved at the Syracuse Law Library!
Oh the memes.....
"Rapey Smurf"
LIBBIES NEED TO LICK MAXINE & SNIFF IT......HARD
No good sob said Creepy Joe as he soulessly gazed in the mirror..
When Sleepy Joe goes to dinner he orders two meals, one for each face.  What a  two faced loser.
Bernie 2020 does that answer your question?
such BS, Biden talks for 5 minutes and says nothing!
Step into the ring, Creepy Joe Biden
lol, I haven't seen these talking heads smile like that since before Trump won the election.
how'd that "most qualified" tag work out for Hillary again?
The DNC’s primarily is their Super Bowl,because they will be crushed in the general.
I can see it now:
"Biden you're the great hands man!"
"Well Trump, you grab them by the p****!"
NOT the best America has to offer!!
China Collusion. They investigated Trump jr. They should do the same for Biden's son.
Creepy Joe is a liar.
SLEEPYCREEPY JOE
I can’t wait till he tries to hug Ivanka and President Trump houses him. #canttouch2020
When u got more dislikes than likes lmao
Touchy touchy touch.  Ahem.  Nothing to see here folks.
Welp...time to turn it in people. The establishment has their guy.
More defeats for fake msm on the way
**Honk Honk**
There' s something very wrong with the closed captions. Both of them.
Your campaign is a cliche!
"The younger generation now tells me how tough things are. Give me a break. ( laughter from crowd ) No no, I have no empathy." 
- Joe 'Out of Touch' Biden








Tulsi / Yang / Bernie 2020
omg joe biden is so horrible. his platform is "Im not Trump" like... that's a low bar
Love ❤️ joe
The Biden Campaign is UP and.....YAWNING...
So. Fake. Good. Lord. Just. Stop. 🤣
Youtube Comment for president 2020
BIDEN....the only democrat who isnt completely INSANE..unfit to lead a nation
YES !!! joebiden.info
say what you want about Biden,at least he drives really slow through school zones
Creepy uncle joe already spreading lies in his announcement. Shameful
Dem Will lose again...
too many democratic candidates, because !!! I would not vote for a Democrat, since everything will be open !!
Biden did not get point : white supremacy was a problem, but not a  critical problem now
This is Joe saying “please forget about the way I pet and stroke children’”
Wow, Biden offers SO MANY POLICIES!!!😁
Cris Mathews legs are tingling!!!!!!
Joe! Please open your eyes. You look like you're sleeping!
Damn, Game of Thrones S8 is so weird.
I like how he refers to antifa, the violent left wing cowards who hide behind masks, as a courageous group of Americans.
thank you, Joe
Creepy Joe.
#MACA. Make America Creepy Again
Biden/Kamala 2020
Ahhh but the difference this time with Biden "running" for an office is he has the blueprint and personal support ,whether publicly seen or not, of the man who did it extraordinarily well and won twice; i.e. Obama.
😎 🏁 #letsgo
Plays the race card, like usual
Not this creep
2020 is looking more and more like Trump ploughing through the democraps , like a bowling ball ploughing through the bowling pins.
Good Grief!
CNN just another word for TOILET
What a laughing stock 😂
Botox Joe
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAA.......snort
Nazis are bad? That's a bold stance, Joe. Who needs Healthcare?
JOE BIDEN had 8 Years with the most Corrupt & Failed Obama Administration in the History of the United States and NOW he says he GOT all the Answers, Joe you have NOTHING the American people WANT your OLD CORRUPT NEWS.......GET LOST!!!

 Joe, says I will bring you....DIGNITY???
8 year olds, Dude...
This is all i heard Biden say in his announcement video.
 "Words and stuff and things, I’m for good things and against bad things! Vote for me!
"
Biden 2020
The public is being denied access to about 2,000 boxes of records from Joe Biden’s Senate career -- information that spans more than three decades.

The University of Delaware, where the Biden archive is stored, says the records might not be available until late 2019, possibly even later.
Creepy old man.
WARREN. WARREN. WARREN!
Address Antifa Joe!
I think Trump is cute, don't you
Awesome!
His campaign vehicle, should be an icecream truck.
Trump 2020
Cnn blows so does Biden
Is it sleepy Joe or is it creepy Joe?
The good thing about Joe Touchin' is that the more he speaks, the less people like him.
Grandpa joe, go home and eat a bowl corn flakes, that speach is full of lies, and deceit you know it the Democratic left wing goondabat satanic jack assess know it..
America will once again throw their support and votes for the Democrats in 2020
JOE BIDEN HAS DEMENTIA AND HIS SON IS ON THE TAKE
Oh look....CNN getting a hard on for the corporate candidate. 😂
No establishment candidates!!
CREEPY Uncle Joe
Joe has more experience than all the other nineteen candidates combined. wow.
CNN SUX.........I think he is having a stroke.
Did you see Bidens announcement video?  In the same speech where Trump stated "there are fine people on both sides" re Charlottesville Trump said "I'm not talking about the Nazi's and white supremacists because they should be condemned totally".  CONDEMNED!!!! 

This is a new low because leaving out a clump of the speech removes all context. 

Regular people on the right also turned up not knowing the Klan and Nazi's were there.  When he said both sides he was talking about the regular right and the left that opposed the statue.

In the same speech he said "you had some very bad people in that group".
He doesn't get it.LOL
Biden's eyes look like the devil.
Yeah, because the protesters have no responsibility for what happened. He could at least try not to look like an extreme partisan with no principles.
The dnc will never learn
As much as I admire the former VP, but I like TULSI GABBARD much better as candidate, b/c she is running on policies and also lays out how to pay for it all.
Lets see some badasses go at it ... Joe vs Don
All emotional pandering
Of course CNN endorses puppet Biden.
If the Democratic Party and the establishment media cause Bernie or any other progressive candidate to lose the primary, don't vote Biden. Burn the Democratic Party to the ground.
Creepy uncle joe.
If Biden is what it takes to get past the Trump nightmare  then he's got my vote.
Creepy uncle Joe likes to touch and smell young girls' hair. Keep your kids away, folks!
Investigate him and his sons Ukraine deals
1:45 "Presuniedstates"  3:04 Much better, but still not perfect!
trump all the way
CNN is so smiley and happy about Biden. Fake, slanted "news" as always.
I'm not even watching the video. I just came to read the comments
IfJoe isn’t proposing bold progressive policies, he’s not getting my vote. I’m done with the democratic establishment. We need something new.
How can an old man like that be running for anything when he stops to hit on every girl in sight (and the occasional young woman too).
Join him at his hair sniffing, boob groping fund raising marathon...located in his basement 🧓
Bernie 2020
Tidepods 2020
Hillary 2020!!!
"How will Biden change the 2020 race?"

A whole lot more kiddie fiddling I bet
Biden and CNN stop playing with our heads
DNC must learn from 2016, do not treat Biden as if he is the only Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential race. The People must decide, not the DNC.
Establishment politician..booo!!
I PRESSED THE DISLIKE BUTTON
Hey creepy Joe touch me in the morning
Hey creepy Joe .....Bite Me 👆
No policy substance. Just anti Trump. This is how we lose. Bernie 2020
Let him run he’s easy to beat
So I guess were basically just making sure Trump wins again and we haven't learned anything over these past few years.  It must be nice be a Trump supporter.
Grope and Change
Who msm is? FAKE COMMUNIST 4TH RHYK
Seems like a perfect candidate for the DNC. They’ll pick either him or Kamala
Biden will be hard to beat in the primaries
Hell no joe
Biden will be the Jeb Bush of 2016
trump 2020
You've been holding out so long and this is what you come out with I feel bad for you Joe it just ain't going to happen
He got the quote wrong trump said there were very bad people on both sides
I fought for our country and this is what our sacrifices are what we believe
Creepy Joe!
Why should Democrats or independents looking for a better and more dignified life trust an ESTABLISHMENT/ status quo candidate that Republicans so gleefully desire?
Creepy uncle Joe
Oh crap. Biden's back. Now I'm confused which to pick between him and Bernie.
oh god, no!
This is so cringe
Joe Biden, what a joke! 
Bernie Sanders definitely gets my vote! Time for a change!
I can’t wait to see the look on Biden’s  face when he  officially declares is dropping out of the election later next year. Sanders 2020!!
Joe Biden is nothing but a left wing crook and a f-in dirtbag 

Here's just a few highlights from his swampy career. (Steve Hilton)

Biden loves to tout his foreign policy experience. And yes, he has plenty of experience with foreign governments - or should I say, their lobbyists. Foreign government lobbying, one of the most inexcusable swamp practices, was all part of the job for Joe Biden when he was chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He took money from lobbyists for Dubai, for the United Arab Emirates, for Ethiopia, for Sri Lanka, for China and yes, for Turkey. Turkey? I seem to remember Democrats getting rather upset when Michael Flynn was accused of lobbying for Turkey

But the biggest payoff for Biden during his time in the Senate came from credit card company MBNA. His craven backing for MBNA, in exchange for their cash, even earned Biden the nickname "the Senator from MBNA."

Let's go Joe.  Dump trump.
CNN = 🤡News Network

Biden is walking for President.
The media are doing a excellent job protecting this pervert.

Almost all who are running have good qualities. Weather it be Biden or anybody else. They have to have the leadership skills to take on senate Right now they are on a mission to try and take us all back to the 1950's Not move all of us in to the future.
Look at happy their are lol
Meh
No thank you 
Next....
His campaign is based on a lie, how special
Hell No!
This Message is For Joe!!!  The Devil is coming for you brugh. .
Another "Hate Trump" candidate that has no platform of his own, other than Hate!
Biden wants to run for president again? Go right ahead, loser, he has 50 yrs experience in losing. He's as slow as a SNAIL 
I'm sure his cokehead son Hunter will hook Daddy Joe with a few lines or so to get him jacked up for the campaign stops.
Wtf LOL
The thing that gives me comfort is that this video only has 50% approval rate. There is still hope that most people are not being fooled.
I can’t wait to not vote for him.
CNN look like they're having an orgasm.  Lol.  Who else remembers when CNN used to be a news station and not the DNC mouthpiece?
They're just Faux news for the left.
Creepy joe
democrats are making the same mistakes like they did in 2016
LOL At the FAKE CNN Poll!!!!  CNN is looking like Fox news more and more each day!
What a traitor!
One more in the #ClownCar !!  Honk !! Honk !!
Male pale and stale
Joe Biden wrote the law that had black men locked up under the 3 strikes and your life's off
Hey Joe! Where ya goin with that kid in yo hands?
I fell asleep during Biden’s video 😴
Bidens platform: grope as many women as possible because you cant indict the sitting president. 

4 more years of sexual harassment!
Just No, let Kamala Harris run. I wouldn't vote for this creep. I rather vote for Harris.
its :Gropin' Joe Biden. Whats his platform? showing all the child molesters how to do it on national television and get away with it.this sob is obviously sick.
That is what make America a light a beacon of hope
This is a weak narrow campaign ad. Corporate centralist with no vision and a poor voting record. CNN that was not "very interesting" at all.
Oh Biden. How many times have you run now? Thanks for slitting the wealthy donors and the establishment vote 😉
wow... that was quite a sad trainwreck... :/
Bernie2020
Biden 2020
Hell No Joe because you have be de eyes and you are out for big money !
we don't need more establishment BS!
Joe Biden can touch a lot of people with his campaign.
Creepy Joe back away from my children.
Wow...


This comment section is woke AF!!!


Everyone in here apparently knows that Joe is a pedo, they can see that his campaign is empty and he's just pontificating, they know the "truth about Charlottesville...


I'm going to step out on a limb and say if the CNN viewership is this woke, Creepy Uncle Joe hasn't got a snowball's chance.
CNN is such crap! They seem so happy about it! Smh! Bernie 2020
Look at these corporate ppl so thirsty. Wow he also looks older than Bernie!! Bernie2020!!
Now the Joe Biden has used the Charlottesville Hoax to launch his campaign, the mainstream media must lock step.

In other words, the mainstream media is dishonestly trying to keep the Charlottesville Hoax alive! The President of the United States did NOT call NAZIS "fine people," but the exact opposite!!! 

Here's the transcript of President Trump's Charlottesville remarks: "You had people and l'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists. They should be condemned totally. You had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. The press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group too." 
Fasten your seatbelts for 14 months of nonstop shilling for Biden... and CNN wonders why their ratings are in the toilet...
Going to love watching the armies of POC and women on the left go after the dems for pushing another white man as president
Enough with the soul crap...... what are your policies.
Biden for president..       ahhahahahahaha...lol lol   ahahahahahahahah.
MAKING
ASSWIPES
GREAT
AGAIN.   DT 2020
All those millions of wasted campaign dollars could've been spent more usefully. There is no doubt Trump is going to win again in 2020. Mark my words.
biden sucks change my mind
I only know one person excited by this news and that person is elderly, wealthy, and just quit the Republican Party... everyone in the real world is voting for Sanders.
●CNN●The clown news network
Biden’s only appeal was that he was less radical. People want a sense of normality back but Biden starts his campaign with a deceitful attack ad?

He essentially supported Antifa while criticising Trump for saying not everybody there was a white supremacist.
Declare running for president while launching a long ass political campaign propaganda video. I love it lol.. go Biden go!
The fact that you poor excuses for a journalist are trying to make Joe Biden look credible as a candidate just means that you are part of the of the far left bias on the media.
He’s going to split the establishment vote by being a softcore Republican, awesome news for Bernie.

Did the cub scouts give Spin-The-Bottle-Biden the boot? He'll make a great pres... The first change will be an EO to make the age of concent 4 to keep himself & the deep state free from indictments
BERNIE2020
Its going to boil down to two candidates Bernie and Biden and Bernie would win but he will be cheated again and then Trump will dunk on Fuccken Biden. Mark my word
Get him outta here...not what we need
Change calls here we go Biden
Just say my name three time get the picture..
Look at the smiles on these corporate shills lmao. God his video is sooooo cringey and overly scripted.
Biden is as fake as CNN!
CNN is fake news
Trump was intimidated by this. So much that he resorted to juvenile name calling in response. Not pro-Biden, but he sounds a lot more presidential than the orange clown currently in office.
Do you hear that? The sucking sound begins.
I heard the CIA will have armed guards at every polling Booth to make sure no illegal aliens vote that's the best thing for America
He offers no polices or issues to fix America. He is chewing on division card. Trying to bring up Charlottesville to launch his campaign.We need to hear about actually issues not identity politics. Why does the left always try to bring up race into everything? It is people like him trying to divide the nation racially. Candidates like Tulsi and Buttigieg never pulled the race card in their campaign and people actually respect them!
BYE-DONE!
What a lot of people (democrats/liberals) don’t know is if Bernie wins the primary, it’s the same as giving Trump the election. Let’s be very clear, a vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump
I no longer believe in any of this Orwellian nonsense.
Biden is literally the only hope for democrats in 2020. You need the rust belt to win
Is this a parody? Really?
Sanders not Biden!
Make America Great Again 2020
Why CNN so excited about this creepy joe’s announcement
"I don't like nazis. vote for me." - Creepy Uncle Joe
If Biden win the primaries, Trump will will the election easily........
Yes!!!!!   ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   GOD BLESS JOE BINDEN
The Trump machine will roll over this clown 10 times harder than it did on Hillary
We dont want Trump again!
#Bernie2020
People need to follow David wood and Christian prince. Sam Shamoun, Sam Solomon.... all these guys have been exposing Islam for years
These news people are all tingling, HILARIOUS
Don't waste your time!!!
I’d rather vote for someone who doesn’t creepily touch young girls on camera... 


But hey that’s just me...
Joe Biden is also part of the problem that affect our nation. He is in the pockets of big mega corporations. A vote for him is equal to Four years more of Trump as our president!
NO to Joe. ITS Bernie TIME. #tangible
Joe at a campaign rally, said that a third time is a charm, Joe they also say that three strikes and you're OUT..................LMAO
ABOUT TIME!!!
Hid your daughters people, he's coming !
In 2016 Biden helped prevent Bernie Sanders from running and winning against Trump. Looks like his goals haven't changed.
Years of Biden policy making and decision making gave us Donald Trump. Establishment out.
This man brings up the debacle in Charlottesville and fails to mention:
1. The "right-wing" marchers had a permits from the city of Charlottesville for ALL of their demonstrations/marches.
2. The left-wing "anti-fa" had no permit. Not a single one.
3. The left-wing "anti-fa" assaulted the "right-wing" marchers with batons, flame-throwers, stun-grenades and acid-bombs.
4. The Charlottesville Police did nothing to hinder the left-wing  "anti-fa"  from assaulting the "right-wing" marchers or even try to shield/protest the lawful and peaceful marchers.
For shame you lying sack of cow-manure!
Yea I love Bernie. But Biden probably has a better chance of beating trump. That’s why Trump’s camp is freaking out about Biden
4:55 😂 Even CNN can’t Hype Biden up interesting =garbage
Creepy Uncle is gonna make the White House the Rape House
JOE BIDEN went on "THE VIEW" and had the BALLS to say him and Obama's administration had NO SCANDALS (are you Kidding me!!)  this is what he's trying to sell the American people.....JUST GET LOST!!

........You Have NOTHING the American People Want!!
President Biden... it’s got a nice ring to it
what a joke lol
I was ok with Biden up until he accused Sanders campaign of trying to slander him, and its sad that one of his backers is " ready to kill Bernie"(lol smh). While its about you their (Sanders campaign) saying it's about us.
Cobra! Cobra!
Sure is a slap in the face of the me too movement. Lol and look at this reporter! The look on her face says she is ready to follow....or come along.
How about Biden running with Obama as his mate, then Biden resigning and we have Obama's 3rd term? I'd like that a lot
Greeting from Germany
GreatNews, Exactly the very best choice.Thank you Obamatrons~TrumpWins/2020~
Hardcore democrat. Beto, Yang, or Bernie
ACCESS: Vice President Joe Biden flew to Beijing in 2013 along with his son, Hunter. Hunter Biden's firm and ended up inking a deal for his hedge fund with the Bank of China days after the visit

Hunter Biden started a private equity fund along with Chris Heinz, the stepson of Sen. John Kerry.
Kerry, the former secretary of state, was a longtime Senate colleague of Biden's. Heinz is the son of the late Sen. John Heinz, who was the previous husband of Teresa Heinz Kerry.
The book describes a meeting in December 2013 between Hunter Biden, managing partner Devon Archer, and top Chinese government leaders. 
A partnering firm, the Thornton group, described the meeting on its web site as involving the biggest fund lenders in China
biggest waste of time for him to run.. he must be bored.
I live in Australia. We are amazed how much Trump is like The Third Reich in 1933.
Vigorous Joe👴Zionist Joe😈 Trump re-elected thanks to Joe Biden winning the Primary. Anybody but Bernie, right Democratic Party leadership 😉
What a terrible vedio from Biden. Empty retoric
Creepy Joe the psychotic child groper is the perfect candidate for the baby killing satanic traitors of the left
Does Biden want the democrats to lose? He  should of stayed out. SMH
CNN supports creepy hair sniffer.
Hillary Clinton almost won, Maybe Joe Biden can almost, almost win. See, what we need is a "used to be racist" vs a current racist. No thanks, I'll take the guy that went to jail for being on the right side of history #Bernie2020
CNN hoping Biden will improve their ratings....their bias is also so obvious.
OMG....establishment pushing for Biden, but I predict that Harris will become the Democratic winner.
Shortly after announcing that he is running for President, Joe Biden, otherwise known as ‘creepy uncle Joe’ hired a former Obama adviser who previously provided “damage control” for the accused sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein.
What a joke it's Trump all the way
Well that was empty as I thought it would be. All I am getting from candidates like Biden are platitudes; I have experience and no policies you can discern but trust me; Trump is bad; and I call myself a progressive when I'm actually not. Next thing we'll hear about how many celebrity endorsements this guy has, and how some iffy polls are in his favor despite what other polls say. 
Biden's voting record is not progressive, they're centrist. Go real progressives 2020!
The democrats are a mess and getting messier
CNN has listed biden up to run since the 2016 Presidential primaries when they kept an empty podium for him during the debates.  Who here has even heard another person say "I want Biden to be President, I hope he runs and wins."  I have yet to speak to another living person who does.
#FvckJoeBiden
#FvckCNN
#Bernie2020
The Sanders freak show is out in force.  Half of Democrats will never vote for Socialist Sanders.
CNN is getting beat in prime time by re-runs of Sponge Bob Square pants.  Let that marinade for a moment.
die already CNN .
Biden looks like he should be in a nursing home.  Frail and tired.  What does Trump call him?   Sleepy eyes?  I noticed there was no footage of the antifa thugs.  Antifa and Nazis are a moral equivalent.
Yes!!! Trump's victory is certain now. MAGA!
This video gave me chills.  Reclaim The Good America!
Biden opposed ending segregated schools, then went on to burnish his rep as a good Southern Strategist and corporatist tool by authoring the Omnibus Crime Bill. No thanks. Bernie Tulsi 2020.
CNNs big push for a creepy toucher and womanizer to become president. Cnn should treat Biden like Trump the way they portray to be so fair and do not vote Democrat
This is the best man to get America out of shame made by Trump.
joe"hold her tighter shes a fighter"biden
Joe Biden   he’ll get the oatmeal vote!  what a schmuck !
Vote for the real leader, Bernie 2020!
"Trump also said that there were "very fine people on both sides"[339][340] and then added "I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally".[340]" (Wikipedia).

Everyone should acknowledge that Joe Biden is spreading a rough and dangerous lie.
21st Century racial tensions are now not only based on ignorance and intolerance; today, racial tensions are now escalating due to economic downturns and regressive tax policies. It’s no longer a moral issue, Joe, give us policy.
Biden:  If I am elected I will not say nice things about Nazis running people down in the street....    dont expect anything more from me though, "I have no sympathy"
LOL...Noticed that the film was spliced and diced.  How many takes did it take to get together the whole little film?  Heard that he did it this way instead of a live announcement he was so afraid that he would screw up again....   He's done before he started, stick a fork in him.
Pedo Joe. love Ukraine kids,
I’m doing it for the kids !
oh dear he will definitely TOUCH the nation
If Biden is so great why hasn't Obama endorsed his run. Biden said because he wants it to be on merit, but I think a glowing reference from your boss of 8 years who formerly filled the position you're applying for would be exactly the kind of "merit" everyone would expect. Weaksauce Joe
A lot of inbreds in the comment section I see
Dear CNN, I voted for Hillary to help stop Trump.  You help prop up Biden and I won't make that same mistake again.
The greatest document in the world :)
If Biden gets nominated, he will be a repeat of hillary
Here's my thoughts on the DNC plan this time around.... With Massive Voter Fraud, like they did to Bernie, the DNC makes sure Biden is the candidate. He picks Hillary as his running mate. With even more Massive Voter Fraud than last time they finally steal the election. Biden has a Fort Marcy Park Moment and Hillary is now President for Life. BTW, Bill Clinton showed us all Polls will tell you whatever you pay them to tell you.
Just say no to Pedo Joe
garbage candidate !!!
Gabbard/Yang 2020
Tick Tock nothing you do can stop what's coming Biden. WWG1WGA.
CNN is so pathetic some time
Tbh it'd be much more interesting to watch a SandersvTrump election. Biden is just too easy to beat
Compare Bernies ad vs Bidens ad . Bernies voting record vs Bidens voting record. Biden stands against Trump yet not stands for anything.  No policy issues just platitudes.  Hillary 2.0
Trump 2020 and all Republicans
has anyone asked melania if the real DT ever left russia ?
What a lying creep
I like Biden but Bernie is the answer
Why can't they just let Bernie win this time!? Gutted...
Trump is racist and has economic polices that hurt  average Americans
Biden wont be racist but will implement the same economic polices.
Oh but he may support segregation
Fighting Racism is what he’s going to try to do to distract going after establishment or ending wars. It won’t work this time ! Tusi2020
Joe Biden 2020!!!!!
Bring Back The Soul Of AMERICA! PLEASE!!!
Biden has good chance of beating Trump but the AOC wing of Democrats wont let him get nomination as they want someone with a 🐱   😁
His first act is to lie in his announcement.. SMH
AndrewYang2020 Do It America, from Canada.
No chance against Trump if he wants to play the insult game.
Announcing his run in a video makes it feel so disconnected and inauthentic. There are much more progressive candidates to pick from.
Gaffe a minute, touchy-feely, neo-lib political hack Biden must never ever get a sniff of the nomination even though the MSM will do everything in their power for him. He was Veep for eight years to a neo-lib President. The corporate controlled MSM desperately needs Ol' Joe!

His record as a Senator is atrocious. When serving as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee he allowed Thomas to testify before and after Anita Hill. Hack Biden had three corroborating witnesses to Anita Hill's testimony at the Capitol Building that the political hack Biden never called to be interrogated. The hack Biden is personally responsible for Thomas being a Justice of the SCOTUS.

Again, as a Senator, he was a vocal opponent of using busing to desegregate schools. He voted for a crime bill which caused the prison population to skyrocket. He's been on the wrong side of history way too many times in his political life. Political hack Biden voted YES for war on Iraq, the cretin.

Biden is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a snake in the grass. C'mon Americans, let's send this phony packing back to his home in Delaware never to be heard from again. Don't let this slippery political hack fool you. Many of you were fooled by Trump. Come back to the Dems as the Progressive Wing nominates The Bern.
Sorry but it's a no to Creepy Joe!
Biden is the Hillary of 2020. If people don't support the true front runner Bernie Sanders Trump will get another 4 years. Don't be fooled.
Going to play well with feminists.........................
The air sniffing, pedo is running for president! The man who has been in Congress since 1970 is going to fix Washington?
He is going to continue all the great things he has done for working class, and minorities because he cares.
LMAO
Pete Buttigieg 2020
let the groping begin.what a shitball.
Creepy joe
Hey joe. You wasted your money on the face lift.
2:13 bro, you were alive during the Cold War, calm down
Whoot, so excited! You go, Bernie Sanders! Yeehaw!
Lots of Russian trolls and Bernie idiots in here.  SMH!
If he is the front-runner for president the Democrats are screwed. The sad thing is he is the best of the 20 they have running so far. Sorry CNN. Trump 2020.
MAMA?.. Make America Moral Again.  Gaffe Joe tries to be like Trump but even gaffes on that.
The Democrats are scared. They know they do not have anybody to match up against our president. Mayor Pete buttadick is not going to make it. And Joe Bloe is basically just an old klansman dressed in sheep's clothing. Good luck because you are going to need it. Re-election guaranteed.
Who is this guy talking to, he's been sniffing to much deep conditioners, hair coloring, shampoo, hair spray, flat iron smoke, just for me, curl activator, bobbi pins, relaxer creme, jojoba oil, cocoa butter, aztec clay, hair grease, hot straightening comb residue and lard !!!
Thanks for reminding me I needa up my donation for Sanders....👉🏾🌹
Was this commercial also plagiarized
Flashback: Joe Biden's first presidential run in 1988 cratered amid multiple instances of plagiarism
The way he is around kids should tell everyone he doesnt need this office
Joe Biden For President and for  Vice President Bernie Sanders 2020 Democrats good luck I hope win
People of this country, Joe included, need to listen to the entire video of Trump's comments on Charlottesville.  The media, as usual, cherry-picked what was released.  I, like the other lemmings was willing to jump all over Trump, until I listened to the whole tape.  Reality is totally different from what the media chose for us to see.
He is definitely targeting minority voters. Folks, let the battle begin!
Practically no one wants Biden to become the Democratic nominee, let alone the next president. 😂
😴
Who cares if CNN is a left mouthpiece... no one has a problem with fox news being republican propanganda?
So chose to run for president based on completely false quote that somebody told him Trump said at a press conference after Charlottesville.  Shouldn’t somebody have told him that Trump actually never said that about the Charlottesville white supremacists? That he actually condemned them all. Better yet send him a link to the press conference on YouTube so he can see for himself. His” Good people on both sides of the argument” statement at the press conference had to do with the debate in many citys across the country about whether statues in various parks should be torn down or not. 

surely Biden didn’t know that... right?
UNCLE CREEPY JOE for 2020  WE SMELL VICTORY!!!!!    Bring all your wives and daughters, don't forget grandma.  Creepy Joe's slogan- 8 to 80 , blind, crippled or crazy, if they can't walk drag them!!!!!
Ladies and gentlemen the next President of the United States.  Joe Biden #Biden2020
Ten years ago people would have bought this shit..  but now we're more educated , we know the fake PR  bullshit behind your empty words,  we've seen the tricks the games before ...  it doesn't work anymore
Go Bernie and Beto ! Please send more women.
Does he even have any policies? His whole platform is “orange man bad”
😂😂😂😂
Did anyone hear what he is saying about America's place in the world? It matters.

How can everyone so be so concerned about perfection? "Nobody's 100%" (points for knowing the movie reference)
Hide your women.....joe is coming.
So hes anti-nazi and he has read the constitution. No policies, not even how to deal with neo nazi's.
Look at how happy CNN are because their corporate darling has announced he’s about to run! No thanks, I want Bernie not another Hillary.
Orange man bad so vote for me!

This was the most vapid and fake bullshit ad I’ve seen in a long time. Also, is it me or does Joe look really creepy here? That makeup and lighting literally makes him look like a reptilian in a human skin suit.
🤢🤮
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I see CNN is shifting gears after their Russian Collusion narrative fell through. Now we are back to Trump being a racist. Just comical.
Looks like the Dems are trying to dilute the Bernie votes...again.
Please No 😡 I hate this guy.... Please we need new faces.
Yang Gang 2020
Hé already lied say that Mr Trump said something about Charlottes but Mr Trump never said it. Never forget that the KKK is not a Republican invention...
Sleepy, creepy, dopey & gropey - Joe has it all! LOL
Go Crazy Joe... Against The Man Trump You are a Joke!!!!!!!!!
Creepy Joe assaults young girls. Don't tell me you all haven't seen him smelling/touching their hair, whispering in their ears. There is NO reason why he would feel the need to do that, unless he's a PEDO. He's nothing but a big pile of 💩. MAGA
Make John Podesta your running mate. Make America Unsafe For Children's Anuses.
What a god damn embarrassment.
So stale. I am disappointed Biden is running.
One really big problem is that Trump never said that. I watched the whole thing (all morning) live. Here's the transcript of the news conference regarding Charlottesville: REPORTER: The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville.

TRUMP: Excuse me, they didn’t put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group – excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.

REPORTER: George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.

TRUMP: Oh no, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down – excuse me. Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay, good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? It’s fine, you’re changing history, you’re changing culture, and you had people – and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally – but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats – you had a lot of bad people in the other group too.
This makes me nostalgic for Hands Across America. Joe is more gone than Trump. Even if there weren't the video issues, the last thing we need in the White House after Trump is an old gaffe machine. #NotBidenOrBust
What a JOKE
What a Joke. Slander against Trump is how you start your campaign! Grow up.
Yang show me the money
Won't win the nomination.
The Republicans even know not just Trump did the Republican Party days of being elected or number even they know it Trump the only one that's scared the Republicans are to
JOE:  you have my vote, sir...  I will be registering every person I know who isn't registered, I will do my best to get as many people as I can to the polls, I will donate money even though I can't afford it, but it's that impt.... we cannot afford another week of the lunatic trump let alone an additional term... It was a great video, it made me feel some hope.
lol
not a single policy in his ad, just attacks against Trump
Just heard Biden is running..........after a 12 year old
did Joe Biden just apologize for touching little kids? and then on the same sentence will you vote for me for president?
People got fooled by Obama's warm and fuzzy speeches! Now Biden is going to follow up with his warm and fuzzy speeches which does nothing for me! Record does and Biden's record fails to get my vote!
Does this mean cnn loves Biden now instead of buttigeig? They dumped Kamala and Beto, get ready buttigeig
“Trump is going to change the very fundamentals of this nation”.... uhhh yeah? He’s doing a great job at making this country greater every day.
Poor Joe Biden still thinks he has a chance even though we are well aware how he assisted his son's business in China and Ukraine and how he interfered in the Ukraine's investigation by getting their attorney General fired.  His sexually seductive behavior with children alone (which is all over youtube) will get him thrown out pretty quickly.  Is the left using him as a distraction for what's coming?
He’s not gonna change the race.  He’s framing his campaign on a straight up lie, as if people can’t look up what trump really meant.  Asshole
Obama on Biden: "He revitalized American manufacturing as head of the middle class task force." This kind of self-congratulatory BS can send people in such a rage they might vote Trump again.
Watch as CNN suddenly drops Mayor Pete, which they had been cradling for weeks, and runs full speed ‘into bed with Biden’ with no eyebrows raised.
Gee if only we could run a corporate established democrat and see how that would work out.- Oh wait we already tried that in 2016 and Hillary lost to an orange buffoon. Established democrats never learn their lesson. What you going to give us, Joe? Fluff talk, endless wars and college students drowning in debt.  No thank you. Ill got with the progressives.
This video makes Biden appear unbelievably irrelevant. Of course white supremacists are terrible, but they aren't keeping many people up at night. Economic issues are. Go Bernie! Biden will crash and burn once we get to the debates.
Joe Biden's campaign slogan "No child left untouched"
Pls God. Pls. Pls let Biden be the Dem. nominee. I want to listen to Trump roast creepy joe Biden. And all the montages of him groping women. Smelling little girls hair. Right in front of cameras 😂😂 pls Lord make this happen.
That moment you realize thumbs up and thumbs down is almost even
I’m sorry but why would he run??? Lol
Biden is spot on! These are dark times and Biden and Mayor Pete would bring back light and unity. Trump supporters are all negative, angry and divisive people Charlottesville is a perfect example of that. Biden needs to constantly use Trmp"s words against him. Trump admitted and is proud to align himself with White Nationalists.
It's so exciting to see Joe run.  The guy who still doesn't understand the meaning of personal space.  The guy who cares about the soul of the country, as he works with the wealthy to carve out more of this country.  That's what he's doing tonight, as he attends his fundraiser.  He's not going there to say what he'll do to help the common man.  So, I don't see Joe as nothing more than a corporate owned politician that is being handpicked by them, to keep those with free ideas from being heard.  After all, we're going to be hearing all about how great Joe is, to the exclusion of the other candidates.
What a pusshead.  Videos...  Get it, he can't put 2 sentences together so it has to be a video, so they can edit it.  Wait til the debates, he'll have a cold and do it by phone, so his advisors can tell him what to say.  And is he stupid enough to not know what his President really said about Charlottesville?  Or is he just lying because he knows the left handed media won't play it either.  President Trump condemned white supremacists and nazis.  He was defending the poor knuckleheads that are still fighting the Civil War and revere General Lee.  Good people, just misguided.
BERNIE 2020 - He has the policy and the most progressive way to beat Donald Trump. Internal polls show Bernie would win in Michigan, Wisconsin and PA. Vote for Bernie! #Bernie2020
Lol running on the Charlottesville hoax lie. Everyone knows the violent radical left showed up to a legally permitted rally to suppress peoples rights. Creepy Joe is done before it even begins
AUG 15TH:  "And you had people -- and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists -- because they should be condemned totally." Trump said this shortly after saying "you had fine people on both sides."  IDC IF YOU HATE TRUMP BUT AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT BIDEN AND THE NEWS MEDIA ARE LYING TO YOU!
Joe bidden, right decision at the right time to safe America from losing all that makes America America. The past 3years has been characterized by Trump Dictatorship and executive recklessness. However, I think in the whole of America  there should be better candidates.. Hush!
yay.......more democrats running on the proposition "trump's bad we're not trump vote for us not trump" It worked so well for them in 2016. Maybe second times the charm?
I am sick and tired of this "Trump said (insert statement)" rhetoric. There is more to a person than a few of his statements. Can we stop focusing on people's slip ups, and instead look at what they really stand for? I don't know much about this Joe Biden guy seeing as I'm not American, but what he's saying sounds a lot like the empty words I have become used to hearing from politicians and the media here in The Netherlands. It's all virtue signalling, and trying to win personal arguments instead of debating actual stances. This mostly seems to come from the left, and it makes everyone who has genuine, thought out left-leaning beliefs look bad.
None of the democrats have a chance and they know it! They aren't stupid. They just hope that we are stupid and donate to their campaigns. It's all about the money!!! Trump 2020!!!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA omg this is gold... he even think he can win OVER Trump AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Go away creepy Joe
{{{CREEPY JOE FOR PRESIDENT}}}...😂😆🤣
Was that a joke? Seriously, was that a joke? The soul of this nation is in trouble, lol. It was in trouble before Trump took office.
What a joke
This is sick.... Joe is framing himself. He only tells half truths.
XDDD
I don't care which democrat wins... as long as a democrat wins.
Hey CNN, why don't you show other candidates 5 min+ announcement ads? How about Bernie Sanders' 2 min announcement video? I guess you already chose your establishment candidate like last time.
Look at this woman gushing over Biden, in an ecstacy  as though she is madly in love. Doesn't she see that BIden is so old and so white, almost a corpse?  He is a tired old goat. No chance.
Every conservative is hoping Biden wins the primary so he gets destroyed in the election. This guy is as fake as they come.
Feel The Bern

Social Democracy is different than socialism and communism. Its what the wealthiest, happiest, and most free nations have. Scandinavia is evidence.
hahhahahahahaha
CNN s i said Hillary and her minions accuse and point every where else 
because either they want to make what theY do seam common place or to 
hide their own actions ,it is a shame  CNN is bought and paid for by the 
very same people that hate Trump and our fight for national sovereignty 
over socialism and tyranny ,every commoner has the same rights as the 
queen of England in this country ,if you vote democrat you vote for 
slavery , VOTE / TRUMP 20/20 FOR national sovereignty AND THE FREE MAN
Hourly reminder it's okay to be white and I’m Pretty sure Antifa would consider being called "American Patriots" as a insult.
Joe has No policy, or career success, just childish hate mongering.
No Joe. Not a chance.
Trump as our president is apparently the greatest threat to our country according to joe. the danger is unlike anything he has ever seen. So you're telling me selling iran weapons and voting in favor of forced busing in inner cities was totally fine.
He asked obama if he could use his campaign tactics he said alright but don't make it look like you copied.
Great stuff from CNN! They didn´t make a big thing out of Joe´s nasty habits and are glad to announce his bid. It doesn´t matter a single shit policywise if Biden becomes Prez or not so i´m betting he´s got an enormous chance of ´winning´the primary over somebody more popular. If that´s the case Joe will lose to Trump by the way. Joe Biden has a worse trackrecord than HRC and sucks like an Industrial vacuumcleaner at debating which make me think even potential supporters will get turned off.
History will look back at this as when these media-democrats were exposed as the fake-hyping hypocritical bullshitters they are. When they called violently attacking peaceful demonstrators who disagreed with them "brave", when Joe Biden himself called it "American" to be throwing piss jugs and trying to burn people with homemade flame throwers and acid and attacking unarmed protesters marching to keep a statue that is rooted in our history from being torn down. When the media and a large portion of democrats considered anyone who was not on their side racist and began abusing terms like Nazi, Racist, and all the phobias to attack their opposition by riling up anger against them rather than defeating them with sound logic. When the democrats ousted their own people just because they didn't agree with their slandering campaigns and instead asked them to focus on actual topics rather than platforms of hate while themselves proclaiming to be AGAINST hate.


That is what this will be looked back on, and should their bullshit succeed and we get one of these emotion pandering lying pieces of shit like Biden in office history will mark it as the beginning of the  descent of American culture over promoting tolerance of other's cultures regardless of how toxic and violent they may be. Want to fuck kids? Say it's part of your culture and some tolerant group of lawyers will give you probono lawyers to virtue signal to everyone that they love other cultures and we ought to accept their good and their bad, that our own culture is racist and evil even though it's apparently so good everyone wants to fucking come here!
The video was all about Trump and Biden's opposition to Trump. Talk about what uou will do for the country, apart from replacing Trump. 
Personally, I would like to see one of the younger people running .... win. 
Old politicians is old... time for new ideas and thinking, the world needs people to be invovators.
Geeze, it looks like they just dug him up. I guess that old white joe has to be the savior for the democrats in 2020. To avoid upsetting the lunatic base of the party old joe makes a video and plays the race card right out of the gate. He has to convince the radical leftists, who run the party, how how sorry he is for being an old, old white male. It seems the CNN anchor is willing to forgive him. She appears as if she is ready to rub one out right on the air.
🤡🌎
Lock up your kids America
Gotta love the irony in this speech.  “There is so much hate in this country!!  Let’s all hate a general group of people who don’t all believe the same thing but just because they’re republican they must be super evil!!”
Blacks for Trump 👌🏿🇺🇸
Why are there so many fake accounts here supporting trump?
News agencies exist to tell people what happened, not what they wanted to happen. CNN is so biased and they don't give news, but they give their opinions disguised as news and they're getting away with it.
"The Battle for the Soul of Our Nation"   OMG too much DRAMA!!!
Yay creepy Joe Biden announces he is going to  run
This dude ‘s corporate media candidate. Not my candidate he will lose . I promise you that! I will never vote for CNN’s. Candidate
If Joe is elected we will have more senseless global wars, sending our troops to fight wars foreign countries won’t fight for themselves.   

Say No to Joe.
Buzz off
Don’t let cnn divide humanity. The government lies to us and we will get our freedom back as one collective... without joe Biden 😂
It's too late he missed his chance. He refused to stand with Hillary for his personal reasons. Trump has the game in his favor. Years later joe decides to speak up. Where were you Joe? You had 8yrs to get a game plan.America doesn't need another pillow puncher who looks in the mirror talking tuff.
BIDEN, I employ you to go back to the old folks home and don't interfere with Trump and his supporters from making America great again.  God supports him and if you get back to your catholic roots he may reluctantly let you into heaven otherwise your burning in hell.
This guy looks ancient... what is he? Like a hundred years old or what. You mean to tell me, that in all of the USA they can't find any fresh blood, someone with some fresh ideas, (instead of these old guys that are trapped in the greedy 80's and who have no clue what is going on in the modern world.) America needs some fresh ideas, someone that is not a corporate puppet, someone that can put an end to the rampant greed and corruption that has been drowning America for decades. Someone that will look out for the interests of the American people, instead of owing favors to the corporations that pay millions of dollars for their election and re-election campaigns. (Someone like Pete Buttigieg would work for me.)
It sucked what is wrong with you?
He will pledge that he will carry on the legacy of REAGANOMICS. Its Bernies race to lose after this Trump mess that Biden helped create.
How old is this dinosaur?
Still lying about POUTUS huh? Is anybody buying this crap?
His video is so dishonest. It is disturbing.  Ironically, he misses the point that Democrats share antisemitic beliefs with the far right.
Trump must be crossing his fingers that the DNC succeeds in ramming Joe down our throats, despite the multiple scandals (groping, abusing office as VP to help his sons Company plunder the Ukraine), the corporate backers of establishment dems would rather lose with Joe than win with Bernie.
Biden has too much of a cluttered past.He destroyed Anita Hill , his passing of his much hated  bankruptcy bill, his locking people up for life  and his touchy feely past.
Most Americans hate Joe Biden.
Another Corporate Democrat! More of the same, too old bought and paid for career politician. Damn, are we gonna put "Capt. Bonespurs back in ? The Dems may be dumber than the republicans.
Boring. "Second class Joe" will be annihilated.
God's gift to Donald Trump...
no one spreads more hate than the left
Did they give Bernie Sanders free ad time when he announced? No. Are they even trying to pretend like they don't have bias anymore?
Why does “Diamond Joe” Biden hate u/BasedTerry? The night before Charlotte was because of the head moderator of r/The_Donald on Reddit, a black man. This is so foolish, and I feel he isn’t interested in MY demographic, a denizen of the Internet. #racist
Crazy that biden/Obama thought it was altruistic to take our money but we can "work" and achieve our dreams...its called taxes vs welfare
You’ve got to be effing kidding me! The guy who gropes little kids?
Hillary's male clone is running. Oh goody.
You're not gonna get the black vote!! There's a lot of better people running that actually aren't pretending to be pro black.
Wow! Spewing lies, go sniff some more little girls hair.
“Courageous group of Americans” lol. Antifa are pathetic proletariat LARPERS who are only comfortable acting tough in large groups. Doesn’t matter what you think of the Charlottesville marchers, they had a right to be there and Antifa attacked them because of an opinion. But leftists only like free speech when the opinions are approved by their democrat handlers
Oh i will vote FOR him IF he BECOME president of ANIMALS...HAHAHA
Honestly, Trump is probably not a racist. He is an honest person who lets the words in his mind come out of his mouth. This makes him look like a bit of a buffoon sometimes.  But in his heart, he really means what he says when he says things like he wants the best for all Americans and America.  In stark contrast to Hillary Clinton who calculates every word and does not consider the truth. He despises the Nazi posers and white supremacy. The good people he was talking about were the sons of Confederate soldiers who were there to save the monuments from removal. The bad people on the left he was talking about were the Antifa people who went there armed looking for a fight.   It’s not that difficult to understand. And sad that this is what the left holds onto to ramp up the negative rhetoric. Even Joe Biden probably knows this.
Less than 600 people showed up for this Obama lacky.  Ha ha ha.
Rush Limbaugh is ON POINT about this entire sad display of BS
Seems everybody was smart enough to know that Trump was talking about those people supporting the statues, to bad Biden and CNN aren't smart enough to know that, or are they just haters?
Creepy uncle Joe isn't going anywhere. Particularly if he intends to perpetuate this FAKE NEWS Charlottesville crap. Lies and deception isn't going to get it anymore folks. 👎
Wow demoncrats are so desperate they are going to promote this creepy guy?  Hide your daughters! Trump guaranteed 2020
Why is Biden running if 10 year old girls are not old enough to vote?
I'll only vote for Creepy Biden if he's handcuffed and wearing a Hannibal Lectar mask.
Wonder how many Russians are on here? Probably quite a few.
So he made a group of people the boogie man in his video and used fear and division to garner support with 0 mention of policy.  Same old establishment politician BS and CNN anchors and their big money advertisers LOVE it.  Hopefully the young enthusiastic great people of this country get out enough support for Bernie or Warren to stop this tool from gaining the nomination because that will either be 4 more years of trump or Business as usual for the banksters war machine...
Anybody knows what is the name of the bgm of Joe Biden's campaign video?
If Trump talk is Biden's message, he has already failed. He has nothing to offer then. Biden's experience cannot be Obama's presidency, because Obama was simply put, A charm, and nothing more. Biden will so fail that it won't be funny
Snooze fest....... I'd love to get a beer with Biden, but not as president. I am a single voter issue, Medicare for all, and because of that I support Bernie.
Now he's old Lying Joe.  President Trumps words on Charlottesville were taken out of context and fed to the American left again and again.  CNN you know it, Old Joe knows it.  Joe is a joke.
Biden is a humle good guy, so I guess stupid america will vote Trump one more time...
The dems are self imploding. The hate trump party can’t win on issues.
I’m so glad Biden is officially running! I was afraid there wasn’t going to be a 77-year old, serial-groping, Iraq war-supporting, Anita Hill-doubting, big bank-supporting, anti-gay voting, backward-thinking career politician running for president to represent my views!
Fake News CNN: “Save us from the evil socialist Joe! We don’t want to pay more in taxes!”
When will he change to his Muslim name?  Minnie me o-gag,ya?
His voting record is horrible.
Creppy Joe and AOC for Pres...
Jesus! How much did they pay you guys to cream yourself over Joe.... Wholly crap!
Biden's slogan on his site "Still Lie Ahead": the Democrat party will still be lying, ahead in the future. More lies to come. Great
American workers need an exceptional award from Uncle Sam upon reaching 175 months of work, employer or employee. Upon reaching this time at work, Uncle Sam shall award the citizen or permanent resident, regardless of the number of employers, a lump sum of $350.000.  Also an award shall be given to all workers who"s job requires them to work away from home 15 days a month or more on a regular basis. Produce harvesters who work seasonally arcross the country would be included. Upon reaching 5 years on the job, the citizen shall be awarded $250.000, 10 years - $500.000, 15 years - $750.000, and maximum 20 years at $1 million.  This will be a good bill for a Senator or Congressman to introduce for a vote. What validates the printing and issuance of money is any kind of legitimate labor and production, for payroll purposes.  Taxpayers money is used for specific things, it doesn't run the whole world.
Republicans are not hurting from Pres Trump...lies & fake news
CNN can’t contain their excitement — Biden a breath of stale air
Vote for trump!!! WWG1WGA
I love joe Biden, but he’s irrelevant against Kamala Harris, Bernie or Warren. Waste of space and money.
Look how much they love Joe the Pedo.
Funny how many dislikes CNN can get for their own channel.
So, have I understood Biden's vision correctly? He wants to make America great again?
Every "Biden 2020 rally" vid has major thumbs down. The anti-white smear merchants are losing on yt.
Thank god Joe is getting in to save us from ourselves. Officer Joe of the character police, reporting sir.
the republicans ran Romney against Obama in 2012 and everybody thought that was a horrible tactical mistake, because Romney is the only one that couldn t attack Obamacare, because it was essentially the same as the healthcare plan he supported. 

now the Dems wanna nominate somebody who can t attack Trump for touching women against their will, because he likes to do that as well. not a good tactic :/
Cnn is we lie to our viewers to get ratings we also report the fake news
Free hair shampoo for all 13 year old girls
That was the most Pathetic Rally Kick off in the entire world. Go Home Joe your a Loser and a Pervert!
Cnn was not smiling when Bernie or anyone else announced! Makes me sick!!!!!
Trump will bury this liar,just like he did to lying Hillary,just sayin'
Make America Grope Again   - Joe Biden
Oh Lord PLEASE let it be him (and not Harris) that faces PRESIDENT TRUMP in 2020;  Please let it be Creepy Joe!
Automatic win for Trump , come on Dems , you gotta do better than the same ol same , that’s why Donald won in the first place .
So is Biden going to talk about policies because he doesn’t have the best track record on for voting for the people. I like Obama as well but just because he was Obama’s VP doesn’t mean he’s the best choice. This not the early 2000’s this is 2019. We need someone who knows what the people really wants.
I like the guy, but no. This is a different time, he needs to stay in retirement or go write another book. This is not the time to go back to the way that things were. That's what got us here. We need radical change, not the same old thing.
Biden's entry music at every campaign stop will be " Keep your hands to yourself" by the Georgia Satellites 🤣😃😄😅😂😆😆😂😅😄😃🤣
Hide the kids.
Joe Biden has no evolutionary purpose. He is irrelevant, constantly made a fool of himself as Vice President, and when he mentioned that China is no threat to the US he proved that he would be dangerous to this country, should he be elected to the White House. Thank God this will never happen! I put crazy Bernie in the same category!
#bernie2020. thanks but no thanks Biden
Stop with the dislikes idiots
No Joe. We don’t need a soul. We don’t have a soul. Stop telling us who we are and why we’re special. Stop with the pandering. First Beto, then Booty Judge and now you. Just stop. It’s not working. It’s not sticking. You know who we really are outside of your entitled bubble? We’re a nation of 320 million dummies who simply need health insurance and economic security without having to work 2+ jobs. And we need to declare climate change an emergency. You don’t have any policies to address these things. Go hang out with your country club buddies Joe!
Absolutely pathetic. Vote Joe Biden or you hate puppies, children and POC's. This is the best his million dollar PR firm could up come with?
Creepy Joe doesn’t stand much of a chance, even with the emotionally charged music he has playing in the background he still sounds creepy. Especially when he quotes only part of what the president said, making it look bad by taking things out of context. He’s shifty and creepy, and people won’t forget his penchant for sniffing women and children’s hair. He doesn’t stand a chance by telling lies, it just makes him more despicable and unbelievable.
Why are so many Republican/Trump supporters commenting? Do they not have anything better to do with their lives? Sad!
Joe Biden touches little girls and babies
The bias comes out full force as CNN tries to sell us on Biden.
What a joke.
Thus it begins.  Creepy Uncle Joe.  Don't forget the Ukraine situation.  Ca't wait until Trump thumps him.
Joe.. Trump is going to spank you.
The radical left is pathetic no policies only crying #TRUMP2020
So the assistant torturer of Chelsea Manning, starter of the drone war in Yemen- which is now the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, and supporter of ISIS in Syria, which we now have 'lost' and are taking in its refugees- that guy is running? psshhh. Tulsi Gabbard 2020 all day- no more of these corporate run baby boomers- they never do what they say- Obama/Biden case in point!
Trump: Booming economy, America first, strong security, lowest unemployment for colored people.

Democrats: Orange man bad, gimme money and your soul.
Spineless Joe announces his plans to ruin this country. Joe Biden should be ashamed of himself
You would not want him to be a teacher in your child's school . Why would you want him as your President
Little girls are running scared, across America. Joe is a politician's politician. He really likes kissing babies and young children.
The idea that American’s are so weak minded to be completely changed over 8 years is insulting to me and should be to everyone else.
Already lying outta the gate!!
This Joe Biden will be humiliated again. Donald Trump will be re-elected. Joe Ben have no chance of winning and it will be a waste of time and money!
Honestly I was defending Biden until I saw him groping children...
Creepy Joe  2020!!!  💩💩💩
The real culprit behind death of that obese woman in Charlottesville was... her bad eating habits. If she didn't stuff herself with cheap fast food she'd probably not have that heart attack.
"We have to remember what we are. This is America.....
"gUNS IN MY AREA, YAH, I GOT A STRAP, YAH, I GOTTA CARRY EM, (WOO)"
Better hope OLD Joe Biden doesn't get into the White House because his cabinet will be filled with young little girls.
So Mr Touchy Feely Sniffy is a wannabe president. Do it.  DO it.  Trump will win again as a result.  But no problem - just blame it on the Russians.
Worst launch ever.  Trying to exploit the media hoax around Trump’s comments on Charlottesville was just weird.  A depressing video.
Creepy Joe & Kamaltoe will never win. As a matter of fact, none of these Dems have anything good to run on.
I don't agree with the white supremacists, but I didn't see CRAZED faces in the marchers, you usually only see them on antifa types.
Does anyone think that Biden has had plastic surgery or is Photoshopped or his face is soft-focused or something? It looks strange and not like him.
Dude your party is the one that has damaged the soul of this nation.
But look how the unbiased CNN is all smiles
And CNN isn't biased apparently????
These partisan hatefests between people are disgusting
Let the victims Olympics begin. Luckily for Donald Trump there are dozens of democrats in this election.  He will simply have to sit back and watch them devour each other using those same wrap up smear tactics they used on republicans against each other. I expect many sexual assault allegations, accusing each other of being racist, sexist or xenophobic.  I so hope to see commercials with clan members riding on horseback.  Get ready to go back to the 50s. Each candidate must prove they are the biggest victim and at the same time defend predator behavior of the past. The torch is lit and we need to bring the manufactured outrage hard. It doesn't matter if your parents were rich and you went to Harvard you must embrace your true identity of black, gay, faux native American or female.
🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃
IT'S SO EASY JOE ⚘
     TRUMP 2020
Sorry for you CNN. No one see you anymore. You are a fake news
I Joe Biden as president of United States will ensure that all little girls have good smelling hair and relaxed shoulders!
I wonder if he'll campaign in the nude.  Biden is known for lounging in the nude in his back yard swimming pool in front of reporters and family members of all ages.  The exhibitionist has no shame and apparently has mental issues for doing this.
Uhh... I thought everybody saw those creepy videos of Joe Biden touching little girls constantly? How do they suppose they are gonna get past that..?
“The president said there were fine people on both sides”.. oh come on.. everyone with a brain knows he wasn’t talking about the nazis and shit.. there were peaceful protestors on both sides. And there were people looking for a fight on both sides. These people so obviously twisting trumps words is the exact reason he will win again. Everyone in the country should feel insulted by them believing that we are so stupid
Look at their smiles cnn has never been soo wet for someone since hillary
Joe what about specific policies.
I was so hoping for Biden to run!!! Garunteed Trump 4 more years!! TRUMP 2020
Hide yer kids!
If Joe Biden makes Donald Trump, his policies and shenanigans his focus, he will loose the race. He should provide the American people his policies, what he will change when he becomes president, so the voters have 2 choices. If he makes Donald Trump his focus, there, in principle, is only 1 choice.
Why would a news channel play a commercial for candidate? Why would they play the full commercial rather than report on it? Is this a paid endorsement CNN?
Awww, looky how happy the CNN hacks are over the creepy guy running for President.
Why don't they hold Biden to the same ethical standards that they hold Trump when it comes to his treatment of women?
Why does everyone hate Joe Biden so much? Because he kissed a woman YEARS ago on the back of her head?. Becsuse he likes to give out hugs? I don't see anything wrong with that. In fact our country could use a little more compassion!
Biden there are fine people on both sides as well as very bad people on both sides.. People are bad or good and it does not matter what you believe it's just who the person is.... Biden is a bad person he is a pedophile...
Bidens website quotes are subliminally telling you whats ahead! LIES. Either Trump wins again or Dems create a toxic atmosphere to abolish their trust here to election time to re elect Mr Trump. Call me crazy, but that's the way I'm reading it from between the lines.
Remember parents if you see a van that says free candy on it in your neighborhood it's just Joe Biden's campaign vehicle.
Gross
Trump Trump Trump Trump
This is a weak announcement, much weaker than Trump’s 2016 announcement. Biden’s role as Vice President in the terrible Obama presidency will be his demise.
YES, BIDEN!. The U.S. needs an upright and justice ROCK to lead the nation. We need him to wipe off the smeared and dusted badge and bring it shining again in the world. This is what know The UNITED AMERICA not the MESSIE AMERICA!!! WE SHOULD STANDING TOGETHER!! Remember the ridge of American land is named as The Rocky Mountain not the Muddy Mountain...........STF.......
Biden is the one trump fears the most.
Honestly...i cannot see what Trump has done negatively for your country and the people / legal citizens of your country since he assumed presidency. Economy is nearly at all time best...unemployment rate amongst all classes and races are at all time low...he prevented radical extremists from entering the country...in his presidency ISIS was defeated (not entirely since its supporters are so widespread; but at least in its core), he talks sense...yes he is so arrogant towards outsiders...but internally, what has he done wrong??? From a non american here. I dont understand what these democrats want...you want to sell your country out to illegal immigrants?
CNN will repeat the same mistake they made in 2020 and will twice as shocked on November 8th, 2020 when Trump rides his way to victory. Jeff Zucker is blinded by bias and hate
Biden needs to vanosh msm. We the PEOPLE know what he is. Trump is the best president EVER! Oh an aberit mpment in time?.   Sorry jpe your spuing hate war violence and 4th rhyk one world order of hitler is what 20 dnc are
If the DNC is more afraid of Bernie (or Elizabeth) than Trump they will lose with this guy (or Kamala).  The only thing stopping the DNC winning elections is their utter rejection of democracy...that is, thier rejection of listening to the people (who want Bernie).  If however, they want to win, they can get the biggest landslide in decades by primarying with Bernie. Doubt that will happen.
ORANGE MAN BAD! CREEPY JOE 2020!
This is funny if you think about it and it reveals that Biden has no authentic reason for people to vote for him. He has the audacity to take what Trump said out of context and accuse Trump of being racist while Biden himself fought against DESEGREGATION on buses. Does he think black people or anyone for that matter are too stupid to not watch the full video of Trump? Trump specifically condemned white supremacy and racists in that speech and in speeches that followed. Really, Biden, if this is all you have to convince people to vote for you, you have no chance of winning because--believe it or not--most people aren't stupid. Why run as president if you don't have any ideas? Biden just wants power. And Trump is by no means a racist. He's good friends with black people like Mike Tyson and has done a lot of pro-black things as president like creating the White House Opportunity and Revitalization council, pushing for prison reform and the first step act, prioritizing HBCUs, wanting school choice voucher programs for inner-city students so they can receive better quality education, and driving down unemployment for blacks and Hispanics to historic lows. Trump is actually helping black people with long-term solutions. His opponents want to keep them down and dependent on government so they can be used as political pawns. It shouldn't matter what political party Trump belongs to or how wealthy he is. He's helping everyone and wants to put all Americans first.
All the best for 2020 creepy Joe.
Sorry Biden, Americans of European descent are fed up with demographic replacement and the cultural fabrics that have held the nation together ever since its founding being ripped shred by shred. We’re tired of you. We’re tired of socialism. We’re tired of no border laws. We’re tired of the corrupt American establishment and the clown society we live in. We’re taking the nation back from you and your other goons, you weak pedophile.
How about ?  👆Weiner /Holder 👆2020
Hmm not bad announcement. I still prefer Bernie, Warren, Kamala or even pete before biden.
ANTI WHITE!
He is explicitly anti white and celebrates their continued destruction.
Secure the bag! 1000 dollars a month! no questions ask! = Andrew Yang!
Well! If he makes his way back into the White House, all his buddies wives and their daughters! Will have to be ready to defend themselves against, Joe Biden’s groping. He loves to pull the ladies and the young girls close to him. Then he starts the massages. You can watch his shit on YouTube, for your self. This old fart 💨 is a real dirt bag.
Lol "brave woman lost her life" Lulz
No talking about actual policies,  just race baiting garbage
Go @JoeBiden!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Here's The Problems With "Old Uncle Joe" Biden. First Of All He's a Dummy and a 2 Time Loser. Second He Was The Main Worthless Obama Lying Lackey. Third, and Most Important Old Uncle Joe Is Just Too Damn Old. Let's Put This In Perspective. Old Uncle Joe Would Be 78 in 2020. That's The Same Age Trump Will Be After His Second Term.
David Gregory a CNN reporter just said “economy, stock market, Americans being safe”, are all strengths for trump, but obviously he isn’t fit to be president because he isn’t a nice guy?. Give me a freakin break, thank you CNN for re-electing my president.  #Maga2020
People will never learn the establishment wants Biden he is bought and paid for just like most the the rest, do some research. 

Bernie2020
Poor b**tard didn't even have a chance!
cnn is alienating themselves from their own mindless sheep they created over the years... BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!! 🤡🌎👌
So he launched his campaign hinged on a lie? Anyone who cares to do a simple google search can view the video of the comment in question or read the transcript to see that Trump was merely referring to people who came to protest for and against taking down a statue. He clearly did not refer to Neo Nazis as “fine people”. And there were also VIOLENT anti-racism people there too. Violence is never courageous. You can’t fool us anymore, Biden. Wrong era.
Andrew Yang 2020. $1000 a month for every american citizen.
That's a pretty bad announcement video tbh
Thumbs down for Joe Biden. He’s a donor and big money candidate, not worthy of my trust. Just go away Joe 😏😏😏😏
Biden was Vice President during 8 years of failure and 8 years of disappointment. 95 million citizens could not find jobs. Labor force participation rate lowest point since 1977. 13 million more people were added to Medicaid. 11 million more people were forced onto food stamps. The percentage of 18-34 year olds living with parents or family hit a 70-year high. The Social Security Disability rolls increased by 5 million. First administration not to achieve a single year of 3% GDP growth. His record is one of absolute failure.
Wow! His announcement video is a piece of work! First of all, the attack on Donald Trump is totally bogus. His words are taken out of context to make it seem like he said something that he really didn't say. Second of all, Biden says, "If we give Donald Trump Eight years in the white house he will FOREVER and fundamentally alter the CHARACTER of this nation, who we are. So let me get this strait. He is claiming that all that America stands for, and all that America is, hinges on four years of one man being president, and whatever the president does will last FOREVER. Who believes this? That's like saying we are all just mindless minions under the direction of an almighty powerful president who controls what we think, what we believe, and what we do. Utter nonsense! Then, right after this ridiculous claim Biden states that "America is an idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant." He should have added, "Except for Donald Trump is stronger, bigger, and more powerful than any of these things, because I just told you that he has the power to FOREVER alter the character of the entire nation. He then contradicts himself once again, stating that, "Above all else, that's what's at stake in this election." In other words, he is claiming that if he is elected, HE will be the who can be the almighty powerful president who can prevent us all from totally losing our identity and character as a nation! Liberal rhetoric at its finest! Applause!!!!
CNN you and all his other supporter's disgust me... His videos are all over social media with in appropriate behavior with many children.... And your all still willing to advertise his run for president.... Peadophiles are the absolute worst but all you supporter's willing to protect him from being criminal charged are as guilty of crimes against children as he is... You'll do show's about arresting mother's for failing to protect their children bit all of you and so many others do the same thing.... Failing to protect all children from the infestation of sex offender's and peadophiles... How do you sleep at nite???? 😡
He opens with charlottesville  Virginia, the liberals new rebel yell! Its the racial watergate, liberals have zero message but to demonize and talk shit, they have no answers or insight.
Joe if you're listening
You got my vote Brother👍🏽
What a freaking hypocrite! Obama claimed that they would fundamentally change America and now this moron says that he will fight Trump from doing the very same thing! Is there no depth that Democrats will sink to win ? His shady deals with the Ukraine and China,telling Obama that "this is a big fu@king deal on national television, and his hands all over wives and children. He reminds me of the Sopranos. I can't wait until the other candidates tear into him. Another four years of MAGA, woo hooo!
Bahahaha! Creepy Joe GFY! I've just spent ten minutes thumbing down all the leftist propaganda channels, and as I was doing so, I noticed not a single one had higher thumbs up. It's over for you marxists pigs. Creepy Joe might be heading to Gitmo, along with a slew of the lefts other criminals. Uh, The Gay Muslim, crooked Hillary, pencil neck shifty Schiff, Eric can I hold your balls on my chin Holder, Lie retta 
Lunch her quick, etc... I could go on and on. The real question all of you evil ass perverts on the left should be asking yourselves? What's Mjchael, I mean Moochelle, going to do, once her gay ass beta boo is in Gitmo, Losers, lying leftist, whiney ass haters of all that is Holy and moral. The demons of the demon crap party are done. MAGA
Joe take over 
WE SHALL
OVER COME
So he's going to be more of nothing for the country if he's elected? What are your policies? He didn't say anything, JUST PRETTY WORDS. 

Wow! They are so excited about Biden. Come on CNN, everyone on this panel love him and making him sound like he's the savior.
Jeez, talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel
Go joe!
Too old. Too centrist.
Talk about stepping back in time. Doesn't he sort of remind you of one of the old Klan Grandmasters in the 1960s? Remember when he described Obama as the first African-American who was sort of "articulate and clean"? Truly bizarre stuff.
Creepy Joe, is in it to win it...LMAO! I can not wait for the train wreck, he simply can not help himself, and he will be caught yet, again being in appropriate/ Creepy with a woman/ teen/ girl. Further he is nothing more than a promise everyone everything, and deliver nothing to all career politician. Dems you can not win without our votes, we told you Bernie or Bust in 2016, and we still want REAL Change, not more of the same, or more of the insane gender politics, if you think you can without the white male vote demographic 18 to 90 years old good luck. We are simply tired of always being the bad guy...This is up to you.
Biden will rig the primaries, and once again Bernie will be victim of the interests of individuals.

Once again, Democrats will lose against Trump on 2020.

You saw it here first.
LOL he lost twice to both Hillary and Obama he will just lose again.😂😂😂
HOW can BIDEN run for PRESIDENT from GITMO ?
It would be an interesting race both president 🐈🐀grabber and Biden have both been approved by the hand-picked selected imperialist electors in electoral college not to be confused with 🤡Trump University.✌🤠👍🇺🇸
"Everyone is treated with dignity in the US"
Di he also grab the girls with "dignity" at C-Span?
Joe Biden lied about  President Trump just like the media has about the speech he gave on the tragedy in Charlottesville, when   President Trump stated there were fine people on both sides he was talking about the ones in favor Taking down a statue and the ones wanting to keep it up, he was not talking about white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and the leftist protesters in antifa, He flat out denounced white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and the leftist protesters in antifa.
America is a laughingstock because videos like Biden’s actually work.
But guys listen to all those platitudes. doesn't that make you excited about all those policies he might implement if his corporate handlers let him.
Trump will toast,  roast Biden. 😂 Lol.  Mmmmm can't wait for 2020. 2016 will be like pre school
Who cares nobody is for Biden !
Trump said the NeoNazi's and White Nationals should be condemned.
God bless Biden, but I am so NOT excited about him entering the race. He and Bernie both need to step aside.
let's go Joe, bye-bye trump 👋 !!  Biden for 2020. You got my vote ☑
These Liberals dont have a chance in HELL of winning.  We have one of 
the most powerful economies and stock market under Trump like we have 
never ever seen in American history.  This is going to be a landslide 
for Trump in 2020. Easy win
Kiss kiss, sniff sniff
Biden and CNN are such a joke!! Biden will not make it out of the primaries!
Someone needs to tell Sleepy Joe he is running against 19 other Democrats right now...not President Trump.
TRUMPTURDS AND RUSSIAN TROLLS OUT NIN FORCE😱MUST BE SCARED🤡😜😹
So Biden starts his campaign lying about President Trump, beautiful.  Biden and the MSM know that Trump was referring to the protestors in Charlottesville that were not part of the white supremacist group.  The three groups that were there include the fascists (who call themselves Antifa), the people against the removal of statues and the neo-nazi's.   The video doesn't lie, and if you were interested in the truth it's right there for all to see.
GO TRUMP 2020. Biden embraces violence against Americans... it shouldn't be tolerated no matter who attacks who.
he looks like the old captain America in the movie，i vote him！😊
Biden agrees with Trump that women should be touched against their will
Just say no (to joe).
And let's not forget about the 2 Democrats arrested today. One for voter fraud in Texas and, $800,000 book sale scam in Maryland . Make America great again.  Keep arresting political criminals.  2020 baby
Biden is as worthless as the day is long. Im glad he decided to run...here's 
what will happen: he will knock out and delete erase the list of "dummy-crat" Clowns 🤡🤡🤡🤡 running for President. And when it comes down to running against Trump⁉️ Trump will whip Bidens ass all the way to the China border🙁👌🇺🇸
Biden's platform is : Trump's a nazi! Nice. People totally aren't sick of hearing that for the 1000th time.
Hope Bernie gonna win
Just here to thumb down 👎 on
Creepy Uncle Joe
CNN is real news😂 📰
👇
This is gold. Trump now has absolutely nothing to worry about. We shall party like it’s 1999 in 2020! 🇺🇸
Jeeeeez this was boring!!!  Get to the point. Keep the message about HOPE not FEAR. 
Biden is outta touch and outta time.
NOOO HE'LL DILUTE THE VOTER POOL. 

He accepts Coorporate Donations
Nope!
Progressive or face Regression!
Go Go Joe!!!! Help us restore our soul!!!
......Im happy as fk also not only CNN...so CNN has Biden ...Trump has FOX...So all you Trump trolls need to eat Biden shirt!....Biden 2020 and beyond!
No the economy. No the wall st re set. No. The. Country. Is doing. Great. Just.  Virginia.  This. Morherfucker say. Poverty. 😂😂
Lol.  Good luck pedophile Joe Biden.  Even Obama wouldn't endorse you lol
Everyone at CNN looks real Happy that there Buddy Biden is Running which was expected, also Biden opening up his Campaign with Race Politics what is expected from Democrats, everything has to be about race and put American divided against each other.
Thank you Mr Biden,such a powerful video...So proud to be an American!

biden   A VERY INMORAL AND PERVERTED WHO IS FINANCED TO DESTROY AMERICAN AND CHRISTIAN VALUES.
Yes to Biden and Yes to 2020!!
Just another corporate Democrat that we don't need in office. This country needs someone like Bernie or Elizabeth Warren
Great announcement video. Anybody but Trump 2020!!!
Your an empty suit Joe. Bernie Sanders will win the 2020 presidential election.
Russians already at work in the comment section
Who care this ?
The most promising democrat running right now, probably the only one to stop Trump driving the US against a wall
Don't care, it's Bernie time!
I can tell by the 60 tweets from the president and all the trump robots on YouTube that trump and his blind sheep are TERRIFIED of Biden! LOL! I love it!!!
....Candidate Bite me!!!!He's a predator and a pedophile!!!!🖕💩👿👹👺💀☠👎
More signaling from DNC that they're not hearing us.
O well, guess that's it for all the other candidates, we know EXACTLY who the Dems have chosen to lose to trump in 2020.
👎
It's nice to see the Bernie Sanders supporters acting like mature adults, as they always do...
All these vague, bratty anti-Biden “posts”, were written supposedly just following Biden’s FINALLY official announcement that he will seek the Presidency of these United States! They were written by ( I am assuming that these “proving-Biden’s-very-assertions-FOR-him” conflation-ists are multiple. You could an individual with multiple internet accounts. OR, more importantly, you or they may not even be AMERICAN. Or, even IN America. Regardless, You. Are (either singularly or multiply), Sad. And. Willful. Morons. Every single time you, Mister(s) Jones, or Mister(s) Zalinofskipof, open your pustulating maws, little pieces of Donald Trump’s ever-expanding ass fall out. But, LISTEN! This Daddy-Financed, may-well-NOT-EVEN-BE-A-MILLIONAIRE, has LET. YOU. DOWN)! But, It must be, so angrily exhausting. Watching the molitov cocktail you threw at our nation, hoping that having His Vulgarness in The Oval Office would SOMEHOW be personally enriching. The fact that your little cocktail has NOT contributed to the cleansing “light of truth” bringing to justice a corrupt government. But, he has TOPPED EVERY SINGLE  PREDISESSOR as far as LYING, self-interest, CORRUPTION and just his general incapacity for the office, has resulted in NOTHING LIKE WHAT YOU’D HOPED OR INTENDED IT TO BE! The “swamp” he promised to drain has become his new home. He has, in fact, become “THE SWAMP THING”! Overseeing, utterly inconsistently an creasingly immoral , barely HALF JOBBED, destructive and soul-vaporizing WILDFIRE. Open your eyes, my friend, to who or whatever you are, swallow your shame with a cold one and a modicum of grace, and recognize that what you’d assumed would be “just a little prank”; which would also SOMEHOW result in you, PERSONALLY,  having a lot more of what you clearly both want most and care the most about, MORE COLD HARD CASH (which you inevitably mislabel as “Your Somehow Unfulfilled “American Dream”, as if having the OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED HAS FAILED TO BE REALIZED, because of “THEM”. So, you thought Trump would excavate THEM and your dream of wealth would be realized!  But, guess what? OOPS! We have a supposedly thriving economy. Are YOU thriving?  Nnnnnope!there’s LOTS of money being thrown around. But, NOT AT YOU! And, OMG, Tax-wise this year? Whether or not you choose to open your eyes will be moot. But, they will FLY OPEN  when you realize the GAPING LACK of your usual, depended-upon tax refund! You’ll probably end up OWING SOMETHING!  Like it or not, your eyes FLY WIDE OPEN in shock and betrayal. In order to look into your poor little family’s (or, your poor little comrade’s) eyes when you tell ‘em that your usual, three-day trip to Orlando (should you indeed be an American. Otherwize, Stalingrad), is suddenly something YOU CAN NO LONGER AFFORD. Oops! Guess what you ended up doing, with your “little prank”, was do nothing other than BURN DOWN YOUR OWN HOUSE. BUT, person or people or Ruskies, it is not too late! You can STILL, if you choose to,  SNAP OUT OF IT. That WILL require you to stop defending this monster no matter what he does, and that no matter how devastating his lurching about injure you PERSONALLY!  It is time to SEE EXACTLY what is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE. And, two years ago? So, what? You made a mistake. EVERYONE makes mistakes. But you, unusually, will soon have the opportunity (should “The Swamp Monster” still be golfing at Maralongo on YOUR dime) UNDO the mistake you made! There is no shame in choosing, THIS time around, to be a little bit less playful with your country and a little less dazzled by what you mistook, ironically, for honesty: VULGARITY. This has been, BY ALL MEASURES, the most LYING, SELF-AGGRANDIZING and CORRUPT administration in our nation’s history. I mean, what promises has he kept? This “Great Deal Maker” ? No WALL. No NEW HEALTHCARE ALTERNATIVE. North Korea is INCREASING their nuclear program. Putin, who manipulated the election in Trump’s favor, has been let off the hook. BY TRUMP! So Putin got THE BIG THUMBS UP to CONTINUE AGGRESSIVELY INTERFERE WITH OUT DEMOCRACY: UNCHECKED. It is time for YOU to SEE what the vast majority of Americans or, um, Comrades,  have been seeing all along. The man is sick. He is not a “Self Made Man”, he is a “Self made-UP man! He has accomplished NOTHING but a huge tax break for the RICH. That’s IT! DONALD TRUMP IS THE MOST DANGEROUS AND IMMORAL THING TO HAPPEN TO OUR DEMOCRACY! EVER! But! But! But! But, you can now CHOOSE to live, as you once did, a REALITY-based life. TURN OFF THE (RUSSIAN, COLD WAR-LIKE PROPAGANDA ) of “FOX NEWS”. They do not DO news. Do you know that the “mainstream media”, including CNN and MSNBC and THE NEW YORK TIMES have won, collectively, over Seventy Pulitzer Prizes for Excellence in Journalism between them. Fox. Has. Never. Even. Been. Nominated. Not ONCE! I sincerely, even after being rather snarky here myself, believe that you CAN use your five senses (kept in fine fettle, I suspect, with the assistance of Obamacare), and make, not only the vital, small, yet HUGELY necessary mental adjustment necessary to undo your mistake, but to make the LEAP it will require! A leap that must be motivated, NOT by fear and hate, but by optimism and decency. I’ll bet you’ve still got it in you. Stop cowering and attacking and... LEAP! Skoll!
Sleepy creepy touchy old man Joe running for President....He will be touching more kids in plain view while campaigning.
The Corporation got their 'man'. Don't expect this 'man' to deliver Healthcare, banking, or electoral reform. Never has, never will...🦁✌
You can tell the deplorables are terrified!  Look at all the bots troll posting!  Give em hell Joe!
First :10 seconds look at 'blinky noddy the reporterette' 😂💦
Did He forget to say his name or he was running for president
It's set another term with Trump. Wtf are Democrats thinking putting baby boomer vampires as their representatives. Trump knew how to connect to millennials by doing new things like engaging his demographic through Twitter. These baby boomer Democrats have too many skeletons in their closet. They shoulda put the young Latina woman to Duke it with Trump.
Go Joe go........ bring sanity and unity back to the American people.
Finally,  a qualified person for the white house who can replace the incompetent one currently in it.
CNN ,Start showing more agenda on Bernie Sanders.
We already have excited and fresh candidates for the presidency.
No thanks. No more corporate dems/moderate repubs. 


But I will of course vote for him, as I did for HRC, over the unfit autocrat disaster currently occupying the office (or at least the golf course, his private quarters, and the bathroom).
Too bad AOC couldn’t run as his VP. 
Could call it the Grope and Dope campaign.
Crystal ball says TRUMP 2020 win. With majority of the popular vote for the Dems! Everyone is attacking THE LOUD MOUTH instead of looking at the root of the cause. Yang won’t win most likely but check him out on UBI ETC. #YANGGANG
Oh boy! Can't wait for their primaries! Will be hilarious to watch the bunch of fools LOL
Get out the mop. The Reich-wing snowflakes are melting-down here.
Funny how he waited until one day after the shethepeople conference...
  Anita Hill, plagerism, and a lifetime of groping would have earned him raucous boos and jeers.
Independent voter...No way he gets my vote. Same old game, play the race card ! All in all, glad to see 20 running.......piss away that money !
Red rover, red rover send Mr. Groper right over !!
Joe can win it all. He is coming for Trump directly. The fight begins
Joe is an establishment puppet , watch him take corporate money , pack money , oil money , super pack money ect..
Hide your wifes and your kids!!!
Uncle Joe is running for president!!!
Creepy uncle Joe, spend 3 minutes talking about race issue in Charrlottesville on his 5 minutes running ad. and didn't even have the guts to mention anything about woman's rights .Clever( ¨̮ )
CNN and creepy Joe are a good match.
joe you and obama had 8 years of false promises you failed
Jesus Christ this is some pandering nonsense
has nothing to do with age. Biden has trouble differentiating Trump's statements. He has too little empathy. He thinks too small. In addition, each person has the opportunity to change the character in the course of life. Think about it!
If the establishment pushes Biden through the primaries (whether legally done or not) enjoy four more years of Trump for your greed. 

If you thought the reaction from the DNC rigging the primary in 2016 was bad, just watch the fallout this time.
Noooooooo! Biden's ship has already sailed! Hope he doesn't screw things up!
Bernie 2020
Biden is old school democracy he is the same as the other Dems. The institutional Dem, he is no different
Snore. Next obvious political agenda CNN.
I noticed that Uncle Joe never smells the hair of black girls. Not that they are any safer, it's just a peculiarity.
He just "rubs me wrong" lol
Get HAPPY CNN! Your corporate buddy has joined the race!
🇺🇸BERNIE SANDERS 2020🇺🇸
Biden is Obama without the hope and without the drawing power.
Trump was not talking about nazis being fine.
It's a sad day to be the Celebrity Apprentice!!
Yay 🙌 So many young girls will get touched and rubbed during the campaign trail 👧
Joe Biden: America needs more victim complex and transgender bathrooms
Those who support Joe, creepy phuck, Biden prove yet again that you really CAN’T fix stupid 🥴
CNN Is the ONLY people who want biden
Yawn!!! Bernie or BUST
Sorry Joe Biden you pass the crime bill
Hey little girl toucher, Trump will eat you alive on the debate stage. What do you have to offer, nothing. It would be just Obama light. NO THANK YOU!!!
Since 2016 my 401k up +20%. Thank you Mr. Trump. Dems have nothing to offer.
Creepy Joe Biden...enuf said... hey joe , what happened in the Ukraine?? 🤣😂😅🤣😂🤣😂😅🤣
I refuse to vote for Biden or any other establishment candidate(s)
Hide your wives and kids from Creepy Uncle Joe.
Obama, Hillary, Pelosi and the Democratic leadership make sure he is the candidate in ' 20
Hahaha he has such a weak platform that he has to mention Charlottesville and the old “both sides” dead horse.
If you actually listen to the President’s speech, he said there are good people on both sides of the CONFEDERATE STATUE REMOVAL DEBATE!!!

PS
Heather Hayer died of a heart attack.
Fake news CNN the enemy of the people trying to stop Bernie with Elite controlled puppets like Joe
Bernie will lose the primary however. In the first round there are no super delegates. But to win you need at least 50% of the votes. With all the hit pieces, Bernie will get the most votes but no 50%. In the second round the super pack, delegates will come in.
And then will Biden, or Harris win and than Trump have a second term, and the Russiagate will rise again with Mueller 2.0
This will be a "Hands on"  campaign.
Ole touchy-feely guy, you and other DemonRats have already fundamentally altered this nation. 👎👎👎👎👎
I think joe biden will win the nom and then die with a heart attack and be 6 feet under by election day.
It’s official!! The perverts in!!!!!
Bernard is the only one capable of taking down trump.
I’m old enough to remember them criticizing Trump over being dark and gloomy without an optimistic message.
Biden/Weiner 2020
The creepy ticket
Give me a break, I have no sympathy for this man.
More Cooperate Democrate? Bad Idea...
I m not aware of his politics and his stand all the issues . That's the way president should speak ..
💙 Bernie Sanders 2020 🇺🇸
Hmmm let’s see Democrat’s started the kkk, opposed desegregation, supported Jim Crow, and on and on.  And no, there was never a “party switch”.
Biden and the Dems are making the same mistakes they did in 2016.. . they need to stop obsessing on Trump and focus on winning back their base and forming a proper platform
WOW!!! Great announcement! Wasn't expecting that!  Good luck Joe.
My first time voting in 2020, and I'm voting for Trump.
Talk about trying to split the vote. The establishment might want him but the people do not!
even our presidential candidates cant run on anything more than "Orange man bad"
Tell u what you'll never get my vote.  U or the Clinton's or the rest of the demonic rich pricks
Feel the bern!
I will not stand by and watch things get worse for the American people, like they have for the last 30 years. No more fake progressives. Bernie 2020.
Joe "Always a bridesmaid, never a bride" Biden
Hillary 2.0 do you want trump to win? Biden is how trump wins. Not getting my vote.
Going with joe is going backwards.
Thank you Mr. Vice President.  You the man.
Trump has done alot for America
I could come up with a better Healthcare plan than what politician's would. Pretty simple make a law that no more than 10 % of a persons income can be used for healthcare in any calendar year..The doctors can take losses on taxes and anything still owed goes on future years income of the person.You can save in a CD health savings account under your name  with a tax break for investing.
Go home Biden, no corporate democrat can win 2020.
CNN is so happy to push for Joe Biden. SMH yet they smear Bernie Sanders.
If he somehow gets nominated instead of bernie, we deserve a second trump term. Hes the male equivalent of Hilary Clinton
Fake news!
Fake press!
Fake journalists!
Fake reporter!
Fake media!
Joe joe joe sorry my income has improved under trump . Am voting trump 2020
WTF we can't have a paedo represent us 😠 He is going to expose us all and I love my kiddie fiddling 😟
The democrats are running for who will be the biggest clown.
Whatever your party affiliation is I think this race is gonna have to be more substantial on policies and less about emotion. I'm excited at the possibility of America waking up and paying attention. Give your opinion at the polls!
will at least be better than trump. But bernie gets my vote.
No thanks. Stay away, creep.
I’m not voting for him
Trump is going to win regardless. Not only does Certainly Not News use hoaxes and blackmail to achieve thier agenda. But the demokkkratic party are too anti-Semitic and idiotic to win😎
WOW...what a great message for all Americans.
BAMMM, BOOYAH!
Anyone, anyone at all is better than trump, admittedly, I would like to see Elizabeth Warren win, or Bernie not sure yet, but if it takes Biden to bring us home to the business of being America rules America, and not Russsia stealing America via Putans puppets who foy a voice and platform took $$$$ to have their individual pockets and rise to power, the current president and all his cronies who cant wont do their job as a party not due to loyalty to individual #1 but out of fear that they will be seen, found out, implicated exposed for the disgraceful, dishonest,  "we sold our country to an enemy people"  I dont hate Trump or the Republican party, I simply hate hatred...so who ever has the best chance in bringing us back to the nation we have always been, both here at home and to foriegn countries "America the beautiful" Peace and more power 2 u 
" Take Trump down, so that all youngsters can know the truth of what the fiber of this nation was truly meant to seed for all.
The country that up until now, gave a way for one race, the human race to at least attempt to reach for the golden ring with some semblance of possibility that a welcoming nation will give me or anyone an opportunity to thrive. It's never been perfect, but we were always welcoming and we lost that, let's get back to what we the  people want.
The only reason Joe Biden is running is to keep Bernie Sanders from becoming president. To secure the nomination you will need to get a majority of the delegates. If no one gets a majority in the 1st round then the superdelegates will vote in the 2nd. With 20+ candidates, it will be exceedingly difficult for anyone to get anything more than just a plurality. That is precisely the reason so many candidates are running. To all but make sure nobody wins in the 1st round. The superdelegates will all vote for Joe just like they did for Hillary. Joe can win even if Bernie got more votes in the 1st round. This will lead to the same exact thing that happened in 2016. The DNC would rather have Trump get reelected than let Bernie become president. The democratic establishment doesn't represent average Americans. Neither party does. That's why the DNC would rather have Trump than Bernie. Trump, as horrible as he is, won't raise taxes on the rich and Bernie will. They might not like the kids in cages but not as much as they like their trillions in tax cuts. We can't let that happen. We need to fight harder for Bernie than ever before. The only way to win is for him to get 51% of the delegates in the 1st round.
CNN was so happy they couldn’t stop smiling . Pitiful .
The Donald 2020
I'd rather have Trump 🤮
Biden also starts off his campaign with lies about what actually happened in Charlottsville with false quotes.
No chance, Joe!
You can run but you can’t hide from Justice they say
A private fundraiser jajajajaja
Yeah Charlottesville Charlottesville Charlottesville where Dwayne Dixion was pointing an assault rifle at the dude in the challenger and that’s why he hit the gas that Charlottesville????
🤦🏽‍♂️Trump also said theirs was bad people and fine people.why start a campaign with a big Lie🤷🏿‍♂️
He just handed Trump the election on a silver platter. Unless Bernie drops out or becomes Biden's running mate, Trump will win. This will seriously split the vote. We are so screwed.
Sorry joe, not interested.
Pedo joe is the old government we don’t need or want its past time for him to go away
CREEPY UNCLE JOE !!!! LMFAO IS STAR ON YOU TUBE!!!!
Most qualified ! we love you Joe Biden.
CREEPY JOE!!!! believe all women right?????
Democrats need a bigger clown car.
Biden , your facelift has  gone to your head . You can't Botox your political policy record  .
If he has no specific Black  agenda then he gets no vote.We will see!#Ados
He has ZERO policies!! Check out Andrew Yang, he has researched and measured policies!
He had a few good memes with oblama that’s it THATS IT ! 😂 god help you’s😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣👌🏻🌎🤡
After watching 2 years of dirty and lying tactics from the democrats , I cannot and will not , ever vote democrat
No thank you, no more Obama crappy policies.
Well, now this get's even better :D
Yawn...    Biden ran for President three times, in 1984, 1988 and 2008... none successful.
Biden and Buttigieg choosing to run for POTUS on the oh so popular "Vague" policy...  Did I say Vague? I meant Values, Core Values!!
No policy ! this seems like an ad for general election not the  primary
In all seriousness if the Democrats want a realistic chance against Donald Trump then Joe Biden is not the one, let's get a Andrew Yang - Tulsi Gabbard ticket, why elect old establishment elites ? let's bring in the next generation of leaders.


EDIT: I'll probably end up voting for Trump because knowing the DNC they are probably foaming in the mouth for Biden and will make sure he gets the nomination, shame.
The only reason this establishment hack is running is to try and take away votes from Bernie.
RUN JOE RUN!!!
OLD DIRTY JOE 💩
CNN, please don’t shove Biden down our throats during this election like you did with Clinton 😒
I the see the Trumpsturds is getting nervous :)
Hahaha Trump will be dancing of joy, sleepy joe is running, trying to keep hillary and barrack out of jail
"Everyone is treated with dignity in the US"
Di he also grab the girls with "dignity" at C-Span?
Gropin' Joe!!
- Campaign kickoff video that says absolutely nothing about his policies.
- Hosting a private fundraiser for the elite.
- CNN fawning over his candidacy.

Yeah... I'll pass. Bernie 2020.
Is this the first presidential candidate to announce by VIDEO rather than speech? How impersonal, corporate, and fake.
Hope it all comes down to Biden and Trump!!!
I think the video was a big mistake.
No. Please no.
He's creeping up the polls.
Wtf is going on? Why so many dislikes on the potential savior of the dem party?
Biden is gonna lose so bad it’s gonna be embarrassing
Joe Biden is garbage and im a democrat lol
Creepy Joe 2020. Make America creepy again.
Talk about cows grazing in the pasture.
Draft Dodger Donald is shaking in his tiny boots today. Biden 2020🇺🇸
CNN AND JOE BIDEN LOL😂
Joe is the  author of the crime bill,  and he supported segregation during Jim crow. He went to parties with a pedophile and have been accused of inappropriate unwanted touching by multiple women.
Joe Biden will win
impeach traitor trump and send his family and conspirators to jail , where they belong
Ancient dirty kiddy fiddler.
Well, the Russian trolls were clearly ready for this to be posted!
To everyone whining about Biden attacking Trump - get over it!  Trump does nothing but lie, cheat, and attack - and at some point you just have to fight fire with fire.
I saw creepy Joe hugging , kissing and sniffing a child mannequin ,  boy, nothing is safe around him even inanimate objects..lol
He's running on racism? 🤣😂
they sure were chomping at the bit waiting for biden, huh? you can tell who the establishment favors by how the news covers them.
Biden is right. The soul of our country is at stake! We are being flooded with people, because of the hate being spread! Let's stop this! #Biden 2020
He's white and has a wiener. So..
A pédophil as président! WoW
Go home, Joe. You're drunk.
Creepy Joe oh no.
Lock your kids up
you're not fooling anyone, liar!
He Finally  announced  it.
Everything he said was a lie. Does this man not possess the  Ability to turn on a TV that doesn't have CNN on. Does this man not have the ability to access the Internet to see what the truth is? This is the same man that talked about watching Abraham Lincoln home movies.
Apologetics may not be the most effective way to launch a campaign...
Lmao look at CNN doing this worship-piece on Biden. Ted Turner is playing kingmaker again. When will the people wake up?
Lock your young girls and wives away .....to keep them away from Joe Biden. Even Jeff session push Joes hand away from touching his granddaughter ...Jeff session knows what really goes on that's why..it's all on YouTube.  Not fake
He is so corrupt. During Obama presidency , he took his son to China to sign a billion dollars deal with his son......nothing to do with America .
There's a record you can check!
America needs a social democrat as president. NOT an establishment hack!
Look at the likes and dislikes FNN
I was supporting Bernie until he said he supports giving murderers that are still doing time the right to vote. NOPE,  felons should be given the right to vote but ONLY after they have done there time.  I support BIDEN 2020
Isn't there many videos of this guy touching children in a way that no one would want their children touched???
BETA MALE
Creepy Joe 😳😳😳
Good, I like creepy Joe as a losing candidate,
Biden 2020 - "A BREATH IF FRESH HAIR!"
Yeah,give us more of those failed 8 years under obama. Empty suit with no ideas at all.
Crazy Uncle Joe starts off his campaign with a blatant lie about Trump saying neo-Nazis were good people.  Typical.  Also, you can see every detail of his face/eye lift.  He looks as silly as Joe Pesci.
You know there's not a dry pair of underwear at CNN today
Biden is a joke, hide your kids and wife.
YES!!! Pedophile Joe is in the race! He will only make it more difficult for the rest of his fellow comrades.
After all the scandals he decides to run 😂
Creepy uncle Joe is running lol
Handsy creepy Joe
Creepy Joe. Lmfao.
Having the word "lie" in your campaign slogan during this Trump era seems like pure suicide. Well done Biden's PR you already failed your guy. 
Bernie2020!
CNN is fake news.....
He focuses on Charlottesville because his policies are the same old pro-establishment and pro-corporation schtick that Americans have come to hate. It's the whole "let's focus on social issues" because I have nothing to offer in terms of economic justice gambit. Sorry, dude, we see through these tired establishment tactics. If you want to win, you're going to have to bring policies that actually help the working and middle class. Three words: Policy! Policy! Policy!
All you people who lives in Wisconsin , Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas and Florida better vote Democrat in 2020 because you need those 5 states to win the electoral college. .
The Head Of the Broken Democratic Party.
Which side will he feed? And which side will tear him apart?
Another scripted, out of touch boomer. This time though, it's one we've already rejected multiple times. No one can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory like the dems. .
Trump bad! Taxes good lol Who isn’t running for President on the democratic side.
Wow, the right wing rutjobs are out in full force in response to this video. Can you smell the fear? Once trump is gone, they'll have to crawl back into their holes and wait for the next insane republican to cheat his way into the white house.
Biden's slogan : Obama 2.0 but white. 
He can't promise any change. The democratic establishment think they can win the so called moderate republicans by nominating Biden.
Just like Trump said if Obama and Biden were so great he wouldn't be president today. The people already said it once with Hillary that they don't want another Obama like term.
Bernie vs Biden. Gonna be fun seeing two 80 year olds fighting for second place.
Bernie is the front runner LOL not Biden
Another Dem running on NOTHING!....He is the 1% King if running to be President....He is another one that can only run on Depressing the Americans!...Race Baiter is what Biden is running on...Good Luck with that!....Trump/Pence 2020...Keep America Running on the RIGHT TRACK!🚂💪🇺🇸🚂💪🇺🇸
Of course the establishment news network is so excited about Biden.
Go Joe go
Bonehead Biden
Thank you, Joe.  God bless you and America.
Joe. You do not come across as sincere. Just the same old words - and not even close to the energy of Obama. You're toast!
What will biden bring to the 2020 race? Probably a lot of hair sniffing! #creepyjoe lol
trump 2020
He's going to get torn to shreds by the generations of Americans he personally had a well intentioned hand on screwing over for his own personal gratification.
CNN is milking this
One word......LOSER
When Trump said, Good folks on both sides he meant republicans and dembulbs, not neo Nazis of which there few. But you know that CNN CUNTS....we SEE you.....tick  tock. ..
Bernie Sanders cannot beat Donald Trump.  He's qualified, but the Republicans won't let it happen.  Joe Biden is the only candidate that can pull in votes from both sides.  He's the only people will trust enough.  Young voters are crucial and we need them on board.
The guy has no message for America. At this very moment. There is no better man than Trump. The rest are just saying best things against Trump, including the new entrant. Biden. Talk policies and not bad mouthing Trump. Biden you have no credibility left in you. Sanders is actually better than you. Go to sleep old man.
😪😪😪😪😪
biden's campaign video is boring and irrelevant...
I really don’t care who it is, I just want them to beat Trump and be a good president while in office! Guys who ever the nominee is just vote them, we can’t have Trump for 8 years!
Of course! Your moneyed backers demand it from you. And they promised you riches and virgins.....
I'm not remotely interested in voting for basically a Republican if you look at Biden's record as a politician.
More like a battle for his ego. He has no purpose in being president. Bernie for purpose and action 2020
So Uncle Pervert is running does that make those Ukraine & China Bribe Scandals go away? How does running on Choco's Record help? The most Incompetent Treasonous President in History?
Bernie 2020 biden
Joe, ya dont know this time what ya getting yourself into .
Creepy Joe Biden the kid diddler! Bahahaha 🤡🐸👌Honk! Honk!
You're exactly right we do need to remember who we are Trump 2020!
Lyin joe biden
Crawl back to your hole Biden #Buttigieg2020
Make America Normal again Joe! Thanks and hope you win! Third time is the charm!
Desperation.
Now I’m just waiting for Hillary to announce her 2020 run for President😂
I think the white supremacy is just a by-product of economic frustration like Germans experienced as a precursor to WWII. We don’t need a war to make a correction here. We just need to start to agree to some of the changes that Europe made as a result of the war. And, that means a more hybrid system of capitalism and socialism because it’s becoming too expensive to educate ourselves and take care of healthcare needs on our own. Low income housing is also a great idea. Remember there’s no homelessness in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and yes they pay 70% to tax but, we pay far greater in credit card interest and the cost of higher education and healthcare. This country needs to come together to take care of each other.
Looks like all the Trolls are out, looks like they are scared.
It will not matter who is the Democratic candidate. Trump woke up the old past of the US.
A racist has more chance of winning the election than anyone else. In this time with all the hate-fear- to all that are different than yourself it will be easy for the Buffoon to energize them.
I hope that all you peacefully minded American's prove me wrong.
What does the MeToo movement have to say about this? Where's that Senator from Hawaii? Maine? Alaska? Read it and weep, many woman and young girls didn't like Biden kissing, feeling and sniffing them and yet CNN doesn't bother.
This video is not Pathetic because CNN is creaming themselves over Biden because we all expect that but it's more sad because it shows how out of touch they are and  lack of self awareness it's actually comical CNN you are Pathetic Fake News i hope the lawsuit from the Covington kids put you out of Business
2020 Biden 🎉🎉🎉👍👍
Prepare for Biden entire platform to be centered around how Republicans are good people and not policy.
The Salty disgusting MAGA trolls are out on full force, Biden has them worried, just look at the comments, I smell panic lol.
#Biden2020 ♥️👍
Biden 2020 because your children's future nightmares depend on it.
Biden 2020!
Sorry but I'm for Bernie 2020. I recognize an establishment shill when i see one..
Sanders 2020
Joe Biden is the last sane democrat left. The others are open border communist who care more about illegals aliens than usa citizens. They hate America. But still, trump 2020.
Biden is a cool guy but where past having an ok run of the mill. Same ole Establishment Dems. We need a real blow to the head. Feel the Bern🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Say Goodnight Trump and Biden
CNN just can't contain their giddiness.
Ooooo! I love puppet shows : D
Creepy Uncle Joe.
I guess everyone gets a little senile at 80 years old.
Go back to smelling little girls hair joe.
I have been waiting for Biden to finally announce his run.  I feel such hope for this country at this point.
Feel. The. Bern
YANG for PRESIDENT!!
IRONICALLY JOE Biden called Obama first CLEAN , AND SMART African American he ever met, and he was 65 back then..''''' "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook'''''...( He probably tough that all blck people are dirty bastards)
..Back in 70s he voted AGAINST de-segregation black community..
 He also wrote this famous Disastrous Crime Bill designed to Legalize Slavery by imprisoning blacks for decades for tiny crimes..
He's gonna lose. Please everyone search Biden's voting history and his positions on issues throughout his political career. He's a corporatist elitist who's in favour of the status quo. Do not ruin the country and plunge it into another lesser of two evils.
Force Biden on us and I'm voting 3rd party again. No one wants Biden except the DNC. Americans want an anti-establishment candidate. Is the Democrat party going to be so stubborn they won't learn from 2016? Hillary was establishment, Joe Biden is even worse. Bernie would have defeated Trump in 2016. He will do it in 2020. Biden is the DNC and DCCC trying to keep power. The people do not want him. Not being Trump is not enough. Vs politics is Biden's generation. We want to know what the candidates stand FOR not AGAINST. His delay in announcing, saying he is 'thinking  about it' when we all knew he was going to run, just came across as dishonest. 
joe bidebn agian????? same old geezers that run the government. need real change #yanggang
Notice the comments, everyone. The RUSSIANS are in full attack mode. They're running scared...
GO SANDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
First
Wow this movie looks great!
He is going to lose and the Dixiecrats are finally going to due along with the Clinton News Network. MAGA!
Looks like CNN is calling the race for Joe. CNN is just as bad as Fox News! I hate CNN!
Misquoting Trump out of the gate.
Very well done! The other candidates are too lukewarm we need to fight Trump!! So welcome Joe!! My favourite candidates so far : Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, O'Rourke and Sanders...so many great candidates!!
I like Biden but No #Bernie2020
Grope Biden 2020
Great now is big for the big leagues let's go
Ol coooky Joe.
Hide yo kids....hide yo wife......
8 worst years of my life were under obama and biden, you two fundamentally changed America for the worst.   why would I want 4 more years of that?
Anyone else find this a little Queer.He's acting just like Hillary did about campaigning? this tends to tell me theres a set up. when they act like they don't need to get out there or say things it seems like they already know there going to win just like Hillary did...just saying.
They’re so giddy that he’s running. Try harder at hiding your bias fake news cnn
I'd vote for him (or pretty much anyone) over Trump, but this his infomercial is pretty lame.  It'll be interesting to see him and Sanders on the same stage.
The 2020 popular vote will look like this video's like-dislike ratio.  The right rarely wins it.
Good to see Biden confront Trump head-on with the White Supremacy stuff. This will change the conversation and hopefully take the gloves off.
If only CNN were even half as enthusiastic as this about the actual frontrunner, Bernie. Their agenda is so obvious here.
My boi! Joe Biden 2020!
Joe Biden/Al Franken  HANDS ACROSS AMERICA 2020
Yeah it’s official trump won 2020
I don’t see what he can offer that the other candidates haven’t offered the Democrats “more freebies”
Well, at least Biden knows everything there is to know about civics, government, the law, history and the Constitution of the United States because he's BEEN there and done that. I'd much rather see someone in the office of the presidency with vital experience, not some novice, apprentice, mafioso wannabe 'businessman' 🌹
So Biden is going tp play identity politics...
Who needs healthcare when you can have MORE NEO-LIBERAL CORPORATIST PLATITUDES?! Bernie 2020
WATCH THE JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS HEARING WHERE HE CALLED IT A MODERN DAY LYNCHING OF A BLACK MAN AND PEDOPHILE CREEPY UNCLE JOE BIDEN PLACED THE NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK!😱YEP KEEP VOTING TO STAY ON THE DEMOCRAT PLANTATION!
Biden is 4 more years of Obama
Run Joe run....to the nearest assisted living home!
Im only exited for the bromance memes
Yes we are battling the soul of this nation because Democrats are now killing full term babies! Shameful!
this comment section is the circular firing squad obama was talking about.
The creep Biden joins the race.
我党百年长跑有计划取代美国和西方，终级目标就是高举共产主义意识形态统一世界！
我党百年长跑有计划取代美国和西方，终级目标就是高举共产主义意识形态统一世界！
I’m crying
Hey Joe, the Attorney General wants to ask you a few questions, its something about spying during the Obama administration. .. comment sir? 😂 😂 😂 😂  #BidenforPrison2020
#walkaway
Yawn. Biden is like a song from 8 years ago...nobody wants to hear it.
Good I hope we can find more about his son and the billion dollar China deal it’s time to start looking in to all the unethical stuff Biden did for his son to make that billion dollar deal also awesome
Welp....another poster child from a bye gone era......I hope the Dems learn and pic the right choice to repersents the party or agent orange will sneak in again and we can kiss our representative democracy good bye...... 
#feelthebern2020
Biden’s ad has no policy in it. It’s all anti-Trump. That’s how you lose an election.
Love it, absolutely wonderful!!!! Go Joe, go!
Trump 2020 lol this is great news Biden’s son has colluded with China before trump was ever thinking about running.
😂 a lot of undercover Fox News viewers in this comments section. We see y’all,  you think you slick😀. Only Biden can defeat trump and they scared
Soooo he focuses on racial conflicts that the establishment keeps forcing on us instead focusing on income inequality or health care or more importantly corrupt politicians who ignore the ppl and follow their donors yup jus racial conflicts that distract us from the important issues and platitudes
Disgusting old kiddy toucher …… sick. Charlottesville had good and bad on both sides …… the President was spot on. There were normal people protesting the destruction of national statues and then there were right wing zealots and on the radical left Antifa and Black Lives Matter who are the most violent of them all.
another establishment stooge.
CNN is loving it already
Joe Biden baby 2020
hide your daughters and wives!!! :)
Not a good look,...
he is a corporate pusher,,,we need progressivesthat is what the majority want,be honest cnn,,,
It looks pretty windy and dusty out there in the morning...
Does he not realize he is a old white man lol. The progressive left doesn't like this.
Good luck In 2020 anything to get Donald Trump out the white house
Listen, i know you all think biden is old hat, and I do to. But if it comes down to biden vs trump, you all must enthusiastically turn up to the polls and vote regardless
Look at those wide smiles on cnn's biden-pet. The same smiles cnn splashed during 2016 for Hillary.  But cnn is not going to change. they never learn.
Stroooooong no
like I commented, Joe Biden and Sanders need to get their old selves somewhere and sit it down. And live their lives like it's golden, with the few yrs. that they have left. Let these young folks have a chance at running this country. CNN, don't delete my post. You don't delete these racist white peoples post, that calls blacks all sorts of names. I'm beginning to think that CNN is racist.
All I saw was 3 minutes of Biden attacking Trump, what are your major policy positions Sir?
“Some people did something’s”. Seriously what’s the difference?
And to celebrate his announcement, he went to Kennedy Elementary School and groped all of the children.
Well 2020 looks like a landslide for Trump!
people of America are smart and see 
through this Creepy Uncle Joe's  BS
Joe Biden is the person that can whip the hell out of the lunatic at the ballot box where it really counts!
He wrote the crime bill! He's another puppet NOT for the people! Jefferson owned slaves & said a black women who had 2 children a year were more profitable then a farm. Biden is out of touch with what the PEOPLE WANT & NEED.
You talk a good talk Biden but everyone sees through your bs
Creepy joe vs the trump train! This is gonna be good!
Oh no, say it ain't so Joe.
Of course he fails to bring up policy substance.
Why not try a chomo. Go for dems i do not put it past you. Btw #cnnsucks
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Another deep state wierdo
You have to really ask yourself the question…which if any, is Biden’s ideology, government philosophy, social/economic theory?  I haven’t so far or ever, heard him articulating any.  Only that artificial political smile more like a smirk, but no real message to us Americans; especially those which Bernie Sanders so clearly and profoundly has expressed for years. Now Biden comes, out of the clear blue sky and pompously declares that he wants to be our President.  Come on…don’t buy this crap. I know that ill-informed senior citizens, full of old age fears, see in him somebody worth vote for.  But friends, think twice…ok?  There are other people with interests and different needs than yours… for example your sons, daughters and their children. So…don't be egotistical.
Pure Hollywood movie bs. Absolute hokum of the highest order, transparently fake opportunistic propaganda video from the ambitious and thoroughly creepy old hair sniffing patriarch. Talk about manipulative, that music, urgh... Pass the sick bucket
Typical for Democrats to use fake news propaganda about the Charlottesville protest to promote themselves.  It is also not surprising for this to be gushed over by CNN who supports the political agenda of weakening the US Constitution to allow big government socialism to rein.
Biden's values change with the direction of wind... Didn't Joe just parrot Trump??? "Make America Great Again"? Were you better off 4 years ago? What color will Biden's hair be after 4 years as president? Will he pick an "articulate" running mate? The only career politician who never became a millionaire while in office! I don't know if he is a saint or stupid. If I judge him by the same standard that everyone judges Trump, (his gaffing mouth) I guess I'll go with stupid.
He is not for legalizing cannabis. I am saying no to Joe. We need hemp oil, not blood oil and certainly not prison for a plant.
Appeal much to the Republican party Biden?... why not join them
Trump must be afraid of Joe. See all the Negative comments below. Go joe!
Very interesting no Policy
A man with a character, what a fresh air we all can breathe in.
He should have ran last time.
He'll make groping women fashionable
Never in a month of Sundays will Biden be president.  Yawn.   Bernie 2020
He might be CNN's wet dream for a candidate, but ill pass on Biden.
Barph 🤢🤮
Go away Joe with your super delegate corporate money!!!!!!! NO MORE!!!!!
The DemoKKKrat clown show marches on.
He never will be a president,
Joe is already making the same mistake Hillary did. Sad.
Nope he is never going to win ... Look at the energy level of Donald Trump, the man got what it takes....
he ever seen  in his life time. Did he live though the the Civil Rights Movement.
I'm not voting for him I'm voting for Andrew yang but I felt very inspired and proud to be a American.This is coming from someone who voted for trump in the previous election
Creepy Biden , America Says No !
Of course he would trash our President with racism!!How wonderful creepy pedo joe biden is running all women ..men and especially children need to run hide and especially protect all children and keep them away from him. This is scary that he feels he can be president of this country with his creepy record and his knowledge he would have had about the spying and treasonous behavior of Obama and his administration #votenoforcreepyjoe.
His announcement is beyond disappointing...come on. Of course CNN is excited though...it was all Trump Trump Trump...where’s the actual ideas that people vote for? Let’s see how he campaigns I honestly think we have enough qualified dems running. Joe should’ve just sit down and let the others run.
Great intro JB!  People, it shouldn't be about how much money is raised, it SHOULD be about majority of citizens with morals and compassion banning together to remove a destructive racist madman and stopping his traitorous LAWLESS tyrancy! 💗💙🇺🇸
Yeah, good luck w/that Sleepy Joe...>Trump2020<
Just laugh 😂!   Biden is hallucinating!   Poor thing sad
Biden is going to be in prison by 2020 along with most of the DNC and half the Republicans.
Trump is the best thing that could’ve happened to America since America was formed
Policies?
Trump never said the racists were fine people he was talking about the people on opposing sides of the statue issue.  Charlottesville Hoax.
I'm In such a conflict now 😱🤦‍♀️
Bernie 2020
He already failed. Telling lies about what really happened and how president Trump responded which the media is manipulating..
I despise Biden, but I would take him over the socialist, intersectional crowd any day of the week. At least he would not ruin the economy.
I can already hear the Bernie Bros screeching....
The elites candidate for sure
Beau told him before his death "Never run for president", Joe is running anyway........I don't know man........
I'm not voting for him #not my president
Joe Biden hahaha
🙏🙏🤩💯📖
History has a bad habit of repeating itself. It is a broken record of great accusations. And what happens to great accusers and false prophets? All eye's that say they lead, but only lead themselves, accusers, all eyes of all faiths that fail to follow a doctrination of the Lord of all Faiths are indeed false prophets. All eye's guilty of saying they love their neighbor. I learn so much from the library that is, all the words ever uttered. Alexandria thanks you for preserving the word of a Lion behind a Fair O, on desert plains we created monuments to time. And for U.S. a city of sin. A C.A.S. in Fair O. Who the children of Lord A dam. The vacuum that was Hoover. The word of God is a clown. I T, written by King Author, and his children St Eve n Kings created the Apple, the Tower of Babel, St Eve's, Jobs. What a career I've had.
You better get down to specifics Joe Biden. Platitudes are BS. Are you running on attacking Trump? Is that your strategy? What is your platform? WTF do you stand for? Looks like CNN just got a new darling--from Harris to Beto to Mayor Pete and now Uncle Joe. We are sick of the establishment. That's what got us Trump in the first place. Can't wait for Bernie to crush you in the debates.
Damn speaking directly to white people there hnn Joe ?
How can CNN promote this RAT! How can Biden even imagine that he can run?? ! He is an old pervert disgusting and creepy mummy. Even the DMS will kill ans shred him at the first debate. They are all starving jackals.
Yes, this is America and no one wants you as POTUS, except the corporations and the rich to keep the status quo. Just focusing on the racism and bigotry of trump is not gonna fix the gap of income and equality, making the rich and corporations pay their fair share of taxes, ending the illegal wars, education, and jobs. All the candidates can point out the disgusting and horrible characteristics of trump, but only Bernie, Tulsi, and Warren have policies and plans on how to put those policies to work. Joe is just calling trump bad without any policies on how to fix the economy to benefit all Americans, and not just few. Bernie/Tulsi/Warren 2020!!!
Fake news...
Great news , another idiot to laugh at, hahahahaha
Ladies, watch out...  Biden can't wait to be standing next to you...
youtube search joe biden touching   and see what he is all about
YAY
GO
CREEPY
JOE GO!
🗣Booooooooooooooooooooo
no thanks, creepy uncle joe...groping little girls is not a "style"
So not giving a damn about this guy running for President. I’ll take any of the other 19 candidates before this fool
I don't like Biden. He is weak as Obama was. I support Bernie Sanders. He has philosophy, tough and smarter. All Bernie needs is good running mate.
ENDGAME 2020😂😂
Trump will crush Biden.
A leader unlike the rest, he's with US. And we're with him! <3 #BidenAbrams2020!?
Sniffing campaign is on.
50% down votes? Barely 50K views? He has zero chance. No popularity. He will split the vote so Trump can win, he has no chance whatsoever of victory.
I voted the Obama\ Biden ticket in '08&'12. No more Biden. 2020  its Trump Nation. MAGA.
Biden is sending a great message... but everyone... Andrew Yang is the candidate  to check out and vote for. ANDREW YANG 2020!
Trump supporters scream about him being creepy, but don’t care about their president saying he wouldn’t kind dating his own daughter. lol
Any policy........ all platitudes.
No one wants Average Joe.
Biden will make Bernie stronger as Biden competes for centrist votes with Harris booker Pete 👍🏻👍🏻
The DNC is going to use Biden to screw Bernie( again)  Hilarious!  I'm here for the drama and tears!  🍿

Oh yeah CNN sucks!  Trump 2020!😎
So this could be Hillary part 2? And Trump wins again. 
#Trump2020
The Democratic party and the liberal news media are working together just like Hitler did!!!  into brainwash their people into following them and believing what they're doing is right!!! 
(Fact check it)
Trump is no president  a waste of time and an EVIL EVIL MAN HE 2 IS GOING TO HELL AND HIS WHOLE SICKENING FAMILY
..Who wants to vote a womanizer old man , to be a leader of USA .🙄
👉👉TRUMP 2020 YOU ARE THE BEST PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD  / THE GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER 👍👍👍
I'll do what I did to Hillary in 2016, and not vote for him. 😁
Not Joe Biden .... We need someone new ... Bernie 2020 🤙🏻
YEA BABY!!!! TRUMP GOING DOWN & STR8 TO JAIL.👍🏼
Uncle Joe Biden, the perverted groping creep in chief ??????? NO THANKS !!!
Creepy uncle Joe.
Jesus, keep it in your pants CNN. This is not the guy to back.
Biden is always soooooo DRAMATIC!  OMG!
Go home Biden no one wants you
Newsflash - this isn't 1998 anymore. STOP running the same milquetoast Dems! No more consultant-scripted speeches, no more rolled up sleeves, and no more vague answers about "who we are"! The candidate has to be AUTHENTIC and SPECIFIC, end of story.
Creepy Joe Biden will get destroyed by Trump. CNN is fake news.
Avenatti 2020
Pedo Joe... vs Beto
Trump we have a race problem in this country and the American people wants to know how are you going to bring the American people together and end racism in this country .
I prefer Joe Biden 2020 ( more calm)👍😎
I wanted to watch the video, but I was also curious as to which crowd would comment here. Now I know.
Well at least Biden didn't use the Charlettesville lie to launch his 2020 run...oh...and there it goes.🙄🙄🙄
Joe Biden will fail like Hillary. The only one who can defeat Trump is Bernie Sanders!!!
At least he didn't come up and whisper it in our ear...
Forget 'Creepy' - Biden Has A Major Ukraine Problem
Joe Biden done. You too late son. Lol
I can't wait to investigate Joe Biden, and the impropriety of the 1.8 Billion dollar deal his son received from Burisma Holdings. This Ukranian natural gas company simultaneously gave Bidens son a seat on their board as well, all while VP Joe Biden was in Kyiv aka Kiev. I will hunt this witch with the same vigor as the Russian illusion hoax.
That message was bold.loved it.great,if he wins  i will love to see Kamal on the ticket.
CROOKED HILLARY AND OBAMA TRIED TO RIG A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION!!!! LMFAO PAIN COMING SOON!!!!
This was such a crock of transparent bull
Yes, Yes, Yes!!!!🤗🤗🤗🤗
Why does he think Jefferson was from Charlottesville?
CNN is wet right now  Biden is running I wonder if they will attack him at all even one ioda the amount they did with trump
If he is the Dem candidate Trump will win again
Trump would mop the floor with that clown.
This will be fun to watch the 2 billion democrat candidates running for president, eat themselves up!
This old Crock with fading white hair reminds me in the old day all Farmers used tie scarecrows on their farms. Watch Joe's right eye he squints. Jeb Bush was low energy. But Biden looks like on Low Oxygen. He is Dead Man Walking.
MSNBC & especially CNN can’t help falling all over themselves over Old-guard energy sponsored Joe Biden. The mega-wealthy can rest easy now with there corporate sponsor back in the race who will get all the unlimited financial banking they can give to ensure no change in politics.
How libellous, it would be hilarious to see if Trump sues for this slander on Charlottesville. Trump clearly condemned violence on both sides, claiming there were very bad people on both sides but also very fine people (who were not engaging in violence or racist hate)...
Biden is going to make Trump a villain, which meets Trump on his own terms, since he makes his opponents small. Trump does it in a childish way; Biden plans to do it on a very adult level. His strategy seems to be what it is like to see the bad kid in class finally get sent to the principles office. Trump will look like a clown standing next to Biden.
People are so dumb to completely forget all the incredibly terrible acts Donald Trump has done that they completely ignore saying anything bad about him, but when it comes to Joe Biden It's all out war. Biden said something good during that "trailer", I stand by his statement and so should every other sane american do.
He sure has not learnt his lesson... and will lose again. 
No policies, all i'm good, trump is bad with loud music 🤦🏿‍♀️
We know what you did and said, creepy jo, be thankful to be powerful enough not to be in jail right now!!
God. He announced the day Pluto went retrograde. No one would care about him if it werent for President Obama.. He is gross. No way ....he is the past. Cringe worthy.
No thanks. Sanders and Warren is the only way forward.
We support you President Biden from 🇸🇳 you are truly an American I love those words WHO WE ARE🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Laugh at this man as you want. Sensible people will know biden is an honest, credible, hard-working man that this country deserves
DANG, it's 3:49 AM in California. CNN just couldn't wait. Hi Joe.
Didn’t the Democratic Party establish the kkk?
Joe B, the only former VP not allowed within 200 yards of an elementary school...
I'm going to play this when I have a hard time sleeping
How can you call that actual news @cnn?
Bernie 2020
Alright! Who better to replay the Democrats broken record of White supremacy to us than Good Ol’ Gropin’ Joe!! 🇺🇸
I bet Trump has spent the last few hours while attending national security briefings scribbling down nick-names he can give Biden.
Welcome to the race creepy uncle Joe. As if we didn't know it months ago...
Biden drags out the "POINT AND S##T" CAMERA for his opening montage VIDEO? The PUPPET can't even announce his candidacy in person? He has to stir up the TRUMP SAYS BS!!!!!!!
C-ville marches had THOUSANDS OF GOOD people, ON BOTH SIDES. MSM focused in on a hundred people wearing 20th century ZORRO COSTUMES, AKA ANTIFA ( the DOMESTIC terrorist org.), as well as a hundred extremist righties carrying Union Jacks and semis. America ONLY GOT TO SEE the TRASH from BOTH SIDES!!!! The same with the night time march. Why did the MSM give ALL the air time to a BUCKETFUL of TIKI bearing TRASH that sang racist BS, when there were hundreds and hundreds of people there that WEREN'T!!!!! To FEED the NARRATIVE FLAMES that the left FANS!!!! TRUMP IS BAD!!!!! Get over it.
Check out Prof Doc Jordan Peterson who speaks out against these post modern marxists and the campus antifa. Long live the Lobsters.
The only one who can directly defeat Donald Trump, no one else. True power of America... is the power of selfawareness followed by a strong mechanism of self-ajusting, always towards the direction the  best  possible and to the most beauty in the world. Don't don't forget it. 
That's who you are, and that is even more important than any choices to make. Time to awaken again.
Jeb has finally entered the race. Please clap.
What are his campaign promises going to be primarily based on?  Promising not to smell your little girls hair while he stands behind her??  LOL
He already lost..............
FAIL HARD
Disliked by 1.4K “very fine” people on the other side.
Remember what fake news CNN host said about Donald J. Trump? Donald Trump will NEVER BE!! President. Biden has zero chance against the Donald.
If Biden is taking corporate, big business, big rich donors campaign money then he is no different than the other Dems or a republican. Your for the people backed by the people or your for corporate, big business and the super rich. No grey area!!!
Worst idea, ever.
HEY........JOE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST WALKED OUT OF A WAX MUSEUM😕WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?😵😵😵😵😵😵😵
No, just no. Please go away.
Creepy Uncle Joe = ANTIFA SJW lover
He's a living fossil. He should do what a fossil does - staying in a museum of natural history, not running for president.
Awesome. The 20th crazy Democrat to enter. Going to be fun to watch them shred each other. Socialist policies work exactly nowhere.
Joes only advice to kids?? “Don’t date until your 30” sooo creepy
Universal healthcare that includes hair restoration surgery and eye lifts.
NO JOE, NO! its time for younger blood. Step aside old man. Democrats like me want real change. Not more of the same.
PLATITUDES!
Biden will not know what truck him him... Bernie will crush Creepy Joe
The fake media seems so happy that he's running. We don't want another Obama.
if children could vote he vould definetly lose
HIDE YO KIDS HIDE YO WIFE AND HIDE YO HUSBANDS!
Wait CNN aren’t you going to freak out about the fact that he isnt talking about policy?  You go thumbs down immediately on Buttigieg and purposely mispronounce his name and stumble over it.  I dont agree that you are fake news but I do see clearly what you’re up to.
But will Biden bring America a medical plan for all?  Something that all Americans deserve and over 70 percent of Americans support.
Hide yo wife

Biden 2020
Trump refers to Joe Biden as “SLEEPY JOE.” Let’s be clear Biden can do more for Americans while he’s sleeping than Trump could do being awake 24 hours a day.
Vote for Joe
Joe Biden is letting the American people know we have a race problem in this country and we need to address the race problem in this country and Joe Biden wants to fix it.
Google:  the creep Joe Biden
I always knew Biden was the poster child for term limits, but now everyone knows he is the face of:


STRANGER DANGER !!!
Eew 🤮👎👎👎👎👎
Creepy Uncle Joe Biden is what the Pentagon calls :a target rich field".  He has so many bulls eyes on his back he'll be obliterated in the polls before his campaign even gets off the ground.  POTUS  must be laughing his head off right now.  If Biden is the best the DEMS can muster Trump won't even need to run a campaign - he'll just win by a landslide while sitting with his arms folded.
Hey Joe, why don't you tell everyone how you gave Ukraine  A BILLION taxpayer dollars so they'd drop their criminal investigation of your son's corrupt dealings as a member of the board of directors of a natural gas firm?  How about it, big guy?
Read all about it -

Trump WILL "alter the character of this nation" - by draining the Swamp, ending the corruption, and locking up criminal goons like you! Be afraid, be very afraid, Joe!
Here we go again, another win for Trump!
Creepy Uncle Joe wants to become Creepy President Joe
The dumbest man in politics. He needs Maxine Waters to be his running mate, the dumbest woman in politics.
Can he just say PRESIDENT? He says prent or present. It's pre-si-dent.
Gropin Race Baiting Joe 2020!
Crooked Joe Biden
Since Biden is already in the race Russians won't be able to find nothing negative on him and Assange is in jail. Biden 2020
P.S. He’s also a plagiarist.
Excellent!! A real man is running, not some scarred little bone spur russian patsy. LOVE HIM!! A man with ethics that's actually read the Constitution of the United States. Yes!
Can't wait for the Dim debates where you will see Biden walk up behind all the female candidates and smell their hair and kiss their ears. How is CNN going to spin that?
Biden also told a bunch of South American businessmen who can’t wait until the US and Europe become minority white cultures, which is also CNN’s unofficial position. But he’s great in israel.
You have my vote Joe Biden and may the Lord up above be with you always because we need someone like you to save our country from the Putin and Trump connection.
What is the matter with you people? Another old white guy who would be 86 by the end of his presidency. Kamala Harris or Cory Booker 2020.
Trump is a liar and Trump doesn’t know how to tell the truth about anything. Trump is a traitor to this country and our democracy because Trump is to involved with Putin and the Russian Government
Does anyone really think Biden has a chance? You are delusional!
Biden will lose. He cannot win. People are saying Biden is an angry old billionaire with a huge conservative hidden agenda. No amount of money will get Biden elected.
So no policy substance? Just “I’m not Trump.” Well if that’s the case I’ll go ahead and vote for Bernie. Bernie is also not Trump but he actually has policies and a good plan to help all Americans! Go home Joe
I’m an independent voter and the Putin and Trump connection has destroyed our country and our democracy.
lol this is gonna be funny. I can’t wait for the media to report on his creepy predictor behaviour, just like they did with Trump. See if the left will believe the women or him 😂 Trump2020 🇮🇷
He’s too old, too white & too male. So much for the Dems lip service that they're the party for women and minorities.
HEY! HEY! HEY!
I wonder who Bill Cosby will vote for from prison?
Oh wow this is so exciting! Lmao I wonder what my President Trump will say about creepy uncle Joe 😂
Yay, Trump will get his 2nd term! Thank you democrats!
