200 years to build
800 years of existence 
63 minutes to burn

My heart gone out to Paris 💔😢
*EAISLY OFFENDED SNOWFLAKES DO NOT READ THIS. . . . . . .*

So sad, remember going on school trips to visit it as a kid. These hooky builders always setting fire 🔥 to their projects . . . . Like Windsor Castle. 

Anyway, the French Police are investigating & have said "they have a hunch who started it"
🤚🏼🤚🏼😂😂😂
This has Hunchback written 
           alllll over it!
at 1:42 Someone was searching for his lime xD
"Norte Dayme"
Quasimodo really be out here saving us from Frollo
How did they not have any fire alarms or smoke detectors lol. Wtf  the ones who started  the fire are the ones who grabbed the things in the cathedral worth grabbing 😂😂. Why didn't the ones in there phone the fire brigade, no one noticed it was on fire until it was to late an iconic building wow.
I thought this Cathedral was in Rome! The Davinci Code Movie makes sense to me now. LOL
SANCTUARY! SANCTUARY!
it was me. I am so majestic
Bun down Babylon with a single matches stick
I was up in The Eiffel tower This Day and i was over and seeing it after it burned,  18th April i went there
neglect vs. negotiate, word secret revealed by Hanzi comparison.
This breakthrough also deserves immediate attention.
sooooooooooo how was everyones day?
Who cares; ask the pope to fix it. he’s the one that claims that he’s jesus.
Antiquetech is beyond our technology. We cant fix it. This is a cover up.
Wow this year is gone cRAzY
Glad no one was injured. “Blessed is the spot, and the house, and the place,.. where mention of God hath been made, and His praise glorified.” ~ Baha’u’llah

and this happens just before eastern ? .. its a pretty clear sign
i mourn for the cathedral...it is sooo sad...she was one of the greatest artistic architecture of human history. but i am very thankful that i happened to see her.


she was one of the most beatiful things i´ve ever seen...built in 170 years, burned away in 6 hours... today is a sad day for the mankind !!...
Your promotion of the show....."The Good Fight" is going to come back to bite you.  I will no longer watch ANY of your content.
when u  need to consult a professor to explain notre dame
Rip 
WAIT PARIS?!
Some people did something?
France is no longer the nation of Voltaire or Rousseau, it is the nation de les Miserables!
Just waiting for em battlefield 5 comments
Damn Montana of 300 out here wildn
Now this become meme.
this story is so dry
"Some people did some things"
what can last forever?
If you are not sure WTF is going on here?...go research all the hours of research of Project Camelot and what MJ12 John Lear has been saying,,,,Live your life with Integrity without Envy, Hate, or Greed and keep telling your family you love them each and everyday..."
So sad because they believe that the real crown of thorns and that church was made in 1128
Lord Frollo at it again 🙄





Seriously tho, as growing up Catholic, this is horrible.. thankfully they got most of the valuable artifacts out.
cbs staff just happened to all be in Paris,  mike Obama was their also.
these traitors will hang soon , when found guilty of treason and sedation
Oh, it's CBS: you can be sure whatever they say serves their political and corporate agenda. Let me hear this story somewhere else.
That's why you shouldn't ban memes
Prayer for the French people. Glad for the favor in this situation that no one was hurt either. 🙏
Game of thrones is on!
At the end, should new technology be used in the renovation of this priceless relic. Heck Ya. Aluminum can be antiqued  and will look great and you can eliiminate all those absurd flying butresses. This is the 21st Century, so  lets go, we're the cultural that built the WTC and then watched it crumble to the ground in Controlled Demolition style. But only in style. More Aluminum for Notre Dame
Yellow protests...lulz
Someone was stealing a lime scooter xd
"Noter daym"
to sum this up: :(
They could at least pernounce Notre Dame correctly
The dude sounded like a jaboodie buds
an irreplaceable loss.
The belltowers and the main structure are intact. Notre Dame can easily be restored and rebuilt. Lots of old historic buildings have been rebuild all over Europe after the destruction caused in WWII.
Now, the disturbing part is if they, France/the City of Paris/the Catholic diocese decide to partially rebuild it in modern (aka cheap) style. It would be even more preferable to leave it in ruin than have some eccentric startchitect add some contemporary flare to it, and turn Notre Dame into a modern monstrosity.
Rebuild the gothic cathedral as it was, with no design changes, please!
All because Knute Rockne quit
why they do not talk about an investigation and maybe a possible connection with arson attacks to other churches in the last while?mmmmmm🤔🤔🤔🤔
I hope the Hunchback got out o.k..
Very symbolic indeed
It will be rebuilt.  It can't not be rebuilt.
I think Mr. Murphy's tie is a bit too tight.
What happened to The Bell?
Yes burn up
"Babylon has Fallen!"
Feel regret ，，
I wonder who did it. Hmm.
Its them I knew it those Refugees
That truly is tuff
waiting for some crazy man or woman saying that the burning of the cathedral is sign of the end days
1:45 hold on bro... you mean to tell me there’s Lime scooters in Paris??
They must rebuild and restore Notre Dame
God moves in mysterious ways?  Yeah right
Oh My God Notre Dame Cathedral on Fire
Someone played Momo challenge....
Will it be rebuilt?
Quasimodo you had one job!
My uncle visited it last month
I had a Hunch that would happen!
My heart broken.
,OMG That's so sad.
Someone did this,it was not an accident.
What a good view
The all father smiles..
The hunchback wasn't home at the time thank god
can we ban ninja
No comment 🤪
Some people did something...
build a Mosque
This is so sad :c
Quasimodo has now joined the yellow vests.
I’m very sad I was planning my trip to France and to see that a very important part of France is gone it hurts🐿.
Our lady ahh a giant monster
What started the fire?
Elaine's Jersey pronunciation...
God damn it Frollo!
Oh no, poor Notre Dame Cathedral!
Damnn sad day
圣母婊请你不要哭泣……
你要坚强的吹响卡西莫多胯下的天堂的号角。
No plan, no water, no cathedral.
1163-2019 R.I.P. :'(
I hope they can rebuild it exactly like it was.
Bruh moment.
Any one from Indiana
We express great sorrow.
Aye 
Can we get an f in the chat bois
Whats going one to us now to that antic beautiful historic  monument.
Garou ,Celine ,Belle What's matter now so much to remember🙆🔥Notre Dame de Paris now .
how did the fire start? Been watching news reports about this and nobody asks in the reports?
☹️☹️☹️condolence 🇵🇱
Build a mosque
burn devils burns haha cant wait
So sad -a great loss for whole humanity
9/11  X 2
OH NO MON AMI! :(
Oh no, such a tragedy...
Yuanmingyuan
Pronounce the name properly!
So sad 😭
It's like when the Cutty Sark was destroyed in London. So sad.
So dam sad
...The saints show us the selfless love of his way the saints are true interpreters of sacred scripture and he always said about energies the cause of this fire was an electrical overload in the wall and they were the source of the fire a song to comfort the spirits of the Saint Bartholomew of those who died at the shores of the Seine and of swords comes martyrdom of the servants of God now where the huguenot camp's is under siege and in Rochelle happens an error men and women are fighting for their lives, are thrown to suffer and die on the banks of the river Seine then comes that one that with revenge in flames knocks down the Notre Dame tower...
Is the football team o.k.?
Holy smokes.
frollo, not again
Can we send tricia takanawa to report this
Very sad, but for photography insane pictures
The Pope did it!
sad ,but rebuild it
What's the reason of the fire
Really frollo?
Am i the only one who cried? I'm not even French, but I'm depressed at the fact that so much of the history that brought us to where we are now is fading away. There needs to be strict laws placed in order to maintain our significant landmarks, or the next thing you know, places such as The Roman Colosseum or the Taj Mahal is going to collapse.
Lay up your treasures in Heaven not on Earth 👌
Why no news on how or why or who!!
poor gothic church
Globalist are behind it
WHAT CAUSED IT UGGGGGGHH. Lol
Gargoyles and idolatry everywhere.  That church is satanic and has nothing to do with Jesus.  Only people who have read the Bible know this.
No dre daime
Thats crazy
Imaginary wizard building burns.
I think I climbed the cathedral in assassins creed
Thought he said it was home to the crown of thor. Lol. But i do feel for that historical place. Never been to it but would love to go.
Black metal music intensifies
I am all "IN ON HUMAINITY"  ,,easy bet here

Some people did something...

IS PARIS BURNING?
so.. what is foothill marching band gonna do now
So sad 😢😢😢😢
Aaaaannndddd, cue to Miraculous Ladybug ending theme but in a more sorrowful tune ;-; 😭
Tragic event. Even more tragic was the quality of this interview. Both the host and guest are pointless. 👎🏽
Catholic girlschools rule.
The French didn't build Our Lady.
it’d be very expensive to rebuild.  they simply don’t have the funds.
Yesterday I had a Tourism geography exam and I wrote about Notre Dame. 😐
I have no idea what it is but im sure it was important to many people and my prayers go to everyone.
Someone said at the end of the day its just a building. It like saying The sisteen chapel is just a ceiling the mona lisa is just paint everest is just a hill st peters basilica is just a meeting hall the grand canyon is just a ditch a 2000yr old 300+ft tall coastal redwood is just a tree whether natural or man made all of those l mentioned are so much more and are treasures to humanity and the beauty in them and the  memory of them  will last as long as the   human race or longer
The Gods of Gaul are taking back their city. The evil of the Church will no longer be suffered without fighting back!
What?why? When can u guys tell me
🇫🇷❤️💕
Diversity is NOT unity.
Man, I was there several years ago. Now it's burning. Really points out how things come and go.
Waco. Again.
Symbol of state of Catholic church?
I almost cried 😭 this reminds me of my house :(
This is God's judgement on Macron.
Fortunately no one got killed.  It is the mercy sign from God!  But where is our God?
1:45 GET OFF THE LIME SCOOTER

Ayyy my boi Varg Vikernes has returned
This comment section shows how fast people jump into conclusions.
Who?what?why?
Im still confused 😭
Who set the fire?
Frollo's revenge
Dana Carvey?
blame macron
What drugs is this guy on ...from Vanderbilt
Notre Dame Cathedral: Feeling cute might burn down later idk.
Rest in pieces
This Is Very Sad.
I feel blessed to have been able to see this beautiful structure in person a year and a half ago. Pictures and video do not do it justice. I hope it can be restored for future generations to witness and learn about.
Sad news indeed.
U can here a lime scooter ringing in the background
This seems intentional being that there is a religious holiday coming up and that the cathedral is a symbol of western values and culture. Hmmm?
This is sad





Alexa play despacito
I am just curious how did it start?
Obviously the fire was not a mistake
Heartbreaking
NO-TRUH DAHM! Say it right.
Perhaps money have been trashed away to keep up armaments, and bombing the last freely standing street corner in Syria and fire protection of national treasure monuments got a eurochange...sad, very sad, heritage monument gone in flames...
The end of an era and the start of a new. Built over 900 years ago. I'd say you got your money's worth.
Not taken long before the hands extended for cash donations. The Catholic church has billions in the bank... not heard anything from them yet 👎
961st
Omg. Please pronounce it properly. No strong vowels. It’s a French word. Notre Dame.
Damn... I mean, Dame....
...n e news of the crown of thorns?
It's hard to believe so iconic and so old is gone. We were planning on taking a European vacation next year too.
谁捐款谁死妈
I hope I'm not the only one who cried watching the burning on live.
It's that damned Hunchback's fault!








/s
Quasimodo vs Judge Claude Frollo!!
Now there’s Notre Dame they can do about it now :(
A building burnt, thankfully with nobody inside at the time, although historic, stunning and a national treasure, still a building. But no families have been seperated as a result, no children will face short and long term mental health issues through loss.
The levels of swift aid via donation and other suggestions are reasons I'm ashamed to be a part of this race, the human one. Bleurgggghhhhh
oh! je suis désolé de voir ça. 
je suis désolé. 
je prierai pour paris! 
espère que le beau bâtiment ira bientôt mieux. 🙏🙏🙏🙏⛪⛪
#LLNDDC🕊️
Who saw this on news
My God...this is a terrible loss.
What if all the historical landmarks in the world just start burning.
Wow, it is really horrible that such an amazing old building could have been destroyed... 😐
- provoking games by elite ...politician ,, who start the fire ...an priesthood smoke weeds vodoo rituals burn candles vodooo rituals ?
ILLUMINATI YOU WANT TO BURN A CHURCH WAIT UNTIL WE TAKE YOUR SHRINE AND CHILD 👶 SACRIFICING ALTER AND YOU CBS EYE 👁
WATCH ITS COMING TO A END , WE KNOW YOU DID THIS
Me sad😞
This can't be replaced by the fire
I visited this on assasins creed unity! Hopefully everything doesn’t get damaged so I can visit in real life
I bet this was the last gasp Globalist False Flag attack.
Hoping Parisian Christians and Louisianan Christians can heal this year knowing its soul breaking to see a Houses of Faith and Worship burned, though for different reasons.
The world is gonna end soon
Outside building sprinklers are always good
Most iconic church not worth a fire sprinkler system? After 840 years and surviving two world wars, destroyed due to government and church mismanagement.
I just want to reeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!! How sad this is
This video is very interesting.
What a waste of perfectly good scaffold
Just was talking about my visit there yesterday.  I was shocked to hear of this horrific fire today.  Thank God I have beautiful pictures of both inside and outside!
2:58 MMMKAY
Maybe someone stole all the goods inside then lit the fire 🔥
This is what happens when you build with wood every time.
Would it be too much to expect American newsreaders to actually learn to pronounce the name of the cathedral correctly?

Did you do that😠
The firefighters saved it, the roof and the spire are destroyed but the structure, the towers, the bells and the inside are intact (this is a miracle)
Что не делается всё к лучшему
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 😔
Person: Lord do u know this?
God: which?
Person: the Cathedral burning. 
God: I never knew this. Nor.i don't know them. 

Moral:God is not a materialistic God. Religion Is what He don't care. 
 Not of rules n regulation!!
And im about as non catholic as a man can be
Not any more
Christendom remains unscathed
Pff, I don't care.
If this turns out to be the work of Islamic Terrorist, expect Mecca to be hit.
They should’ve turned off fire spread
They should’ve turned off fire spread
family was going to paris and was going to see this...... just a little tooooooo late
I hope France gets better and I'ma sorry that happened I'll pray 🙏 for you France
I was just singing “out there” this afternoon because I was practicing for an audition, and then the cathedral burns down! Crazy !
Molten Metal Molten Metal Molten Metal!!!
This is so sad 😞
It could be a torch or a candle that cause the fire
Who is this man they brought in? What a goof!
To all dear friend they still can build 100 more notre dame.but cannot bring back life .
烧得好
Ok. Who did it?! Rodan or Burning Godzilla?!
So sad although ironically reflective of the demise of France.
The cross
Mecca is next! Watch
THIS IS ANGER ! A SHAME ! PEOPLE WILL RISE UP BADLY AFTER THIS !
HUMILIATION!!
It is so sad to heard Notre Dam was destroyed a little Bit by fire. I was watching Breaking News yeasterday.😭
that message was to the global Elite who are watching your every move
V is that you?
Anyone seen the plans for the new mosque yet ?
Where the f did they get this guy?  I am deeply saddened to see this happen.  This guy has no idea what happens to stone when heat is applied.   The cathedral is a total wreck.  Some pieces maybe saved.  For the most part it will be victim to wrecking balls and bulldozers.  This is not my wish but the truth.  Vivi the French  Vivi Notre Dame.
BURN BURN BURN AND BURN VERY COOL  BY MEVLÜT ÇAVUŞOĞLU
Just a old building
G r e a t now im crying at 2 am
have you heard the name of Dr Zakir naik ?
There has been ten churches burnt down in France in the last month now notre dame .a female isis member was jailed two weeks ago for having a car bomb to blow up this church
Probably caused by some Frenchman smoking at the top of the building
Damn.......
yes thank u Jesus Christ for taking down babylon from within👏🏆
Never heard of it. Now I do!
Disfigured!... I wished I could’ve visited this historical monument before this horrific catastrophe incident. 💔 goes out to people in France 🇫🇷 in general. Taking 2 centuries to build & destroying in about 63min. 🇫🇷 is totally disfigured. An identical/better architectural new construction 🏗 still...
$10 a muslim set this fire.
Funny how no-one talks about the cause.
1:48 lol you can hear a Lime scooter alarm in the background
With enough money, they can fix it good.
The ending is coming ,give it some yrs
praying for whoever is effected by this terrible accident
Hopefully it's just the timber roof that got destroyed.  If the main vaulted arches inside are still standing they should provide some protection for the rest of the inside,


P.S.  See that yellow-green smoke?  I think that's vaporized lead.  Very toxic.
The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands ...
The French people need Jesus and to become Biblical Christians.
I hope Quasimodo made it out. 
I always wanted to visit this site and was planning to do so next summer and damn!
Ugh don’t say Notre Dame like that🤧
The first person to reply has the big gay
very not epic
Crime satanique  les masques vont tomber  Dieu   va le faire savoir  merci pour votre compation  vive la France libre  et démocratique  et souveraine .
I don't mean to be disrespectful or out of line here but Paris has a population of 2 million people and only 1 fire hose???? The entire city cannot save one building burning.
Is this another distraction?
This is so sad. It’s even worse because my friend loves Europe and her and her family were going to the Notre Dame next week😢☹️
Where is the Hunchback going to live now????
First is the terrorist attack in Paris, now the burning of the Notre Dame Cathedral?!
What’s happening to Paris?!
Im gonna blame the terrorist..
@1:44 waiting for the monster to attack.
They can rebuild it.
Imagine if this happened to the Eiffel Tower.
Nice!  Nice!
we know by now the cause of the fire welding sparks from a torch caused it. Notre Dame has not burned since the Revolution and we know how bad that was read Hunchback it will tell you what happened during that fire.
I wonder if they called it fixing news instead of breaking news if that would help
I hope Quasimodo is okay?!?
We should have told Quasimodo to quit smoking blunts inside the church.
LOL no way!
Does no one at your network know how to pronounce Notre Dame?
all the people making jokes are evil and cruel. like wtf would u do this
Only a man made building.
What man has to do now is develop elegant but very strong architecture. The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt has withstood the longest test of time and is the only one of seven wonders of the ancient world still standing. The third little pig who built his house of bricks had the right idea.
Someone didn't want to stay in the bell tower anymore. (Quasi, looking at you!)
HELLFIRE DESIRE XD
NB4 they turn it into a Mosque
This place was Santanic
Did the scaffolding boards get burnt
We all know that everyone is sad. 






I am so sorry that this had to happen 😢 😢😢😢
The jews , they did this. Im sure
Okay what happened I just came back from school and go to YouTube and see this
Hey we need a makeover. Give us money.
How does a building like this burn in the middle of a huge city?
My guess is an electrical fire started in the renovation area from faulty wiring or something. Don't want to jump on the conspiracy wagon just yet.
its just a building, it'll get rebuilt.
Not once was God ever mentioned. These are places of worship unto GOD  the Father, GOD the Son & GOD the Holy Spirit for the masses of Christian's for centuries. And you couldn't even give that respect. And you ( CBS) wonder why people have walked away from your slanted news. You have lost all credibility and should never be trusted again
So the crown of thorns they say was Christ thorns I'm sure they was not gold oh well
Where did the fire come from?
Absolutely no effort to pronounce it correctly. Well done.
Ici c'est la france !!!
So sad
So sad
Why is it that the people doing the interview or news are not in sound proof rooms away from noises background people?
Mon Dieu another world treasure gone!  J' SUIS PARIS💕💖
Good job renovators
so sad
welp. frollo's back at it again
Lmao
Very sad. You really do have to respect the history and the symbol that the Cathedral was. However I don't think they should rebuild it.They should leave what remains and redo the middle portion as a place for people to commune. A place that represents the past, present and future. With a light in the middle where the pointy thing used to be (like the world trade center.) Because this is a new millennium and there's no way they could redo several centuries of history.
I see on the news that it has been saved from TOTAL DESTRUCTION
meh just build condos in its place
1:48 I think it was a lime scooter all along
Gods wrath on the Catholic Church?  You bet this is!  Nothing bad can happen unless God allows it.  Repent!  Take down your idols And statues of devils.
It is a very sad event in the history of man
Neat
They are playing off of your emotions. Your subject of mind control.
I feel very sorry for what happened in France. but I can not avoid seeing that there are entrepreneurs who are going to donate many millions of Euros for their reconstruction. It gives me much more grief that this money is not used to help people. To make donations for people who can do micro-enterprises and do not have the capital to do so. As my case, I work since I was 9 years old. I work but I have not had the luck to be born with money. to have my own business.
if someone wants to give me help to grow. I'm not as important as a cathedral. but I can generate jobs.

There have been a series of attacks and fires in French churches recently. So, who is doing it?
May Allah save and bless Paris
Goog job
Many keep talking about "priceless" in regards to this fire.  Sadly,  It will be interesting to see who establishes "the price" of this.. . And, who owns the insurance, and therefore who pays, etc,. .
Did the Hunchback survived....?
The phrase “God works in mysterious ways” runs a bit thin here?!
Any ideas as to what caused it?
This looks like no accident...someone or some group did this,
Welp somebodys getting fired...
I hope they can restore the cathedral.
Dark forces. Where was Macron when it went up. He'd do anything to try and deflect from the issues in France
what i really want to know, is the fire out?
Uhhh.... umm..... erm...... OOF
Dats the House of Satan... if dat was Gods dat would Never Ever catch a fire...
OMG! Did Quasimodo make it out!?😱
Let it be rebuilt in a contempary style and safer. God bless the people of France🙏
Sneak peek of the fall of Babylon the great
9/11 second edition
Of course they have to talk about the history.Let the ignorant learn.This is not just the twin towers in NYC
I think it's good time to install water sprinklers as part of new innovation. Also good property insurance.
So who did it?
those who try to hide the fruits will be found out Those Who hide wicked and evil things you will be cast down for all the souls that you have took with you
Nash, thumbs up..
Es lamentable ver la perdida de un gran edificio con historia :-(
Shouldent the building collapse completely   after 9 hours on fire? After all buildings in New York collapses after 1 hour of fire.
How did the fire start? Duh! We want to know
I hope this was not arson...
quisimodo snapped.
It is a beautiful cathedral. I hope it is rebuilt.
My first thought was that the government did it to try and squash the yellow vesters. I know it’s an old building (understatement) but you’d think there would be fire protection including fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems. It probably resulted from something to do with renovations. It’s tragic either way. In a time when we are trying so hard to move beyond our past we need those precious few remaining connections to remind us of our history.
Christianity is being wiped out.  I wonder who's up to no good?
The massive fire burns throughout Notre Dame in Paris is nearly similar to the Disney film.
This guy was boring the people so they decided to talk over him in the background
The Hunchback did it.
Moçambique teve uma tragédia e não recebeu esse ibope todo
On.y 250 views
That professor looks like Dana Carvey
Was it arson?
I hope you can feel the feelings of the owners watching the cultural assets that you looted.
I really don’t know how to respond to this. I am not Catholic and can’t understand what is exactly what is going on. I am sorry for the people who are going through this. God bless those who have been effected by this tragedy. And remember that everything happens for a reason. No matter how negative it may seem.
Something not right about this
Yeah, cuz God "loves you" smh
Isis be like "lets take blame for that"
😭😭😭
i really hope the hunchback is safe
U fix it and it’ll burn down again.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If they just would have raked the leaves.....
how does a building of stone get destroyed like this
Glad I saw it when I had the chance
What caused the fire is what's bugging me the most
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤗
For those who don’t know a French millionaire offered to donate 100 million euros to repair the cathedral
800 years of paganism burnt to the ground praise God.
I wonder how the hunchback would feel about This?
Yes!!!!!! A great victory. Crusaders can all gather together and get thrown into the fire too.
This is not "where Saints are made".

Lexicon :: Strong's G40 - hagios

Strong’s Definitions

ἅγιος hágios, hag'-ee-os; from ἅγος hágos (an awful thing) (compare G53, G2282); sacred (physically, pure, morally blameless or religious, ceremonially, consecrated):—(most) holy (one, thing), saint.

1 Corinthians 1 King James Version:

"1Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,

2Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints (G40 - hagios)
with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:

3Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
Satan is coming!!!
800 years old damn sad
I picked the wrong time to become an atheist
Rip
R.I.P BILL MURRAY 

Heard he was there shooting Ghostbusters
Super sad, but realy, you couldn’t find someone to pronounce Notre Dame correctly?! Pathetic . . .
so CBS is claiming that those crown of thorns are the actual thorns put on jesus himself.
This was posted yesterday today is 6th  of April
How’d it catch on fire?
So sad!
Did anyone watch the video of something hovering around before the fire? Go to YouTube, video of the sky
😢
All of socialist Europe is burning!
Columbian flu?
R.I.P Quasimodo :'(
So was it terrorist related?
Like fire, hellfire
They burnt down the whole Talmud about 300 year's ago
What caused the fire exactly?????
🙏
it has a history that is important to the world it can be rebuilt as it always has
What a tragedy! Probably caused by the renovation work. Unbelievable!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is exactly what happened in the movie. Disney is a prophet. This is really sad.
:(
It didn’t have a sprinkler system
Now what? Where are the RIP shirts att? yee
Blasfêmia
Hundreds of churches attacked in Germany and France last year

Research artefacts and arts moved out days prior to the fire, and to have chosen a time around easter. satanists that have temporal rulership of this world are pushing very hard for the coming apocalypse, which they will then usher in their luciferian 1 world dictatorship lead by their false god satan.
ITs pRouNouNced Nau-tre daumn
卧槽？
Macron did it. Attention seeker.
this building survived wars ,pre fire departments, and ,8 hundred years   why a fire now ? we all know this is   islamic Terror
This is sad
A lot of evil that structure has been apart of that fire is,was intentional to the catholic illuminati who agrees
I just saw this video 1 hour after it released and I’m like OMG, I have to see this! It was so unexpected!🙀
Michael à visité ce lieu !
THE CHURCH is THE BODY OF CHRIST, what are called 'churches' are merely where people worship.  One day soon, GOD will burn the whole world.  We will have a new heaven & a new earth.   Paris sees $$$ go bye-bye.
Omg that mans voice!
Damn, this cathedral is a piece of history and it has to go down like this?
Act of God?
Paris is a mess.
dammit Frollo
I blame Khaleesi and her god damn dragons
one word: terrorism
christ wore all those jewels?  that's hard to believe  i thought he was a poor man
It was musluyms, Vive Le Crusade!
arson
My question is why do major public history places always seem to go up in flames Everytime there's a restoration goin on am i the only that notice this and see how it's always religious stuff related to Jesus Christ
Finally news, something that isn't political.
It would be generous, and appropriate, for the Vatican to kick in heavily for the rebuild. And to build for the next thousand years, titanium should replace all of the wood. Fireproof, corrosion proof, good for the thousand years.

This is significance! We are entering the age of Aquarius.. The  old system of relgion are dispearing before are eyes.. 

Behold, when ye are entered into the city,(the new consciousness) there shall a man meet you ‘bearing a pitcher of water’... follow him into the house where he entereth in.”
Noo 😭
Is it just me or is this a sign from God 2 punish all those pedophile pastors 🤷🏼‍♂️!!
It’s a shame that building was beautiful
😢😢
Noob
What was the cause of the fire?
This is an Illuminati.when 11 Tower Do not fall.but one tower have cross is falling
Verry shocked
So sad this happened.. I’m so glad I was able to go there & see it & was able to climb the top.
I’m sure they can rebuild it but I hope this won’t be the next Sagrada Familia that would take decades.
Anyway, this is a reminder especially to all Christians that God & the people is the real church. Buildings are just gathering places & just temporary.. our focus should remain on the worshiping & praise of God, who is not seen but is truly alive, and not the relics, the structure & the material things that we see..
God will destroy the Catholic Church it’s where children are being destroyed
Nothing lasts forever.
Who cares about history anymore
Carter Evens.... what not cigarette jokes??? You can joke on Hawaiians but not this yah??? Don’t come back to Hawaii you fxxken Haole
It amazes me how all the non religious and non Christian's all of a sudden worried about history.. am saying France is no longer a Christian country.. it no longer deserved a historical Christian symbol especially when christianity is being attacked left left and left.. God 4give us all
Hoping they don't turn the towers into minarets.
Wow just when trump been president everything went gone wrong 😟😩
I’m just hearing about this, how did the fire start?
Arson by migrant
Insurance? Oh Jesus Christ said you really must have that.  (Sarcasm) It's over Papa. Give it up. You know what you have to do.  🐾👣🚶💨🌀🌐🌎🌏🌍
Wow
Meanwhile 25 kids died in a bomb attacking un Syria .
Wow
How is there biblical history there when the bible says nothing about Europe
Arson targets. 1. Revenge for the protests of yellow vests. 2. The destruction of Christianity and white Europe. 3. Creating a single world religion of the Antichrist. 4. Approaching Catholic Easter. 5. Soon judean easter.
ISIS already destroyed so many ancient western structures. Surely this wasn’t deliberate too.
LOL should we not burn down all churches, are they just places for pedophiles.? Or is God showing his anger
💔💔💔💔
yellow vest  burned
En lisant les commentaires, on s'aperçoit très vite que les autres pays ne comprennent pas le symbole que cette cathédrale représente pour nous. Il n'est pas question d'une affection religieuse,  mais de l'amour de son patrimoine. Pour rappel, c'est ici que Napoléon s'est fait sacrée empereur
Do you know how they pick up women in Paris now?

Baby you a church? Cause you smokin'!
It’s a building.... At least no one was hurt or killed.

What other religious group would gain greatly from this.. maybe not financially but maybe religiously ?
Rip anor londo
O   O   F
It's just a building! Get over it, and spend time on news that actually matters and affects people lives.
The odds of the church burning down, on the day the titanic sank....

If you're his son why don't you throw yourself from this church and angels will catch, you shall not taunt the Lord God creator . this Does not  mean anything Viva Virgen de Guadalupe Viva Catholicism into his Saints Viva Mexico.
Porque no han dado esta noticia en español.?????
Probably some black metal band who burnt it down
😥
This historical monuments burnt because of à stupide worker that accidentaly put on fire thé wooden roof (i swear if he trown à cigarret h Will ded)
That’s tuff
This was no accident there have been videos already saying the radical muslums did this and celebrated later on
All the material and historical items of the Catholic Church will not be in Heaven when the New Heaven & New Earth come to pass after Christ's Second Coming. We will not be able to take, hold or do anything with material things as they will be destroyed in the end.
 As far as the fire itself, news reports that the fire burned from the inside out. God tells us that we should have no other gods before Him. Yet, the Catholic Church worships Mary, which is placing Mary before God.
Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside 
 -Elton John   'Burn Down the Mission'
Great news. Evil religion. God is coming for you all. It's time to wake up!!
they planned that thing to be  burn down  four days ago they took out all these Bronze Statues and a lot of the other artifacts then all of a sudden it just burns down give me a break that was a planned thing
Dang...
Who let this guy in a news studio
must be islam behind this.....
Maybe the fire is part of an elaborate insurance scam?
Let the fooking building burn.  Worshiping buildings is a SIN.
😥😢😔
MSM has been hiding the truth about 10 churches in the city being vandalised in one week,  more so in the public domain now. Of course, I guess they're going to say it's an act of God.
Disney predicted the future
Alaverga
It was very likely a building failure it was under renovation and then started burning so it can har been caused by noumerss reasons but we are not sure stop blaming people with out knowing if someone acutally did it.
WE KNOW
Dead.....
Nothing is forever. Life goes on. Don’t get attached and you won’t suffer the pain of loss.
Idk why this guy's voice annoys me not  an appealing voice to be describing such tragedy and the stuttering doesnt help
Varg Vikernes approved this
April 15th is the most cursed day of the year
What about our nuri masjid that was destroyed my America?? It was history to us which was 1000 year old!!!
Ok, it’s good to burn.
Nobody cares if houses or hospitals get burned to the ground. But if it’s a church OMG!
ਫਾਜਿਲਕਾ
It’s just a building get over it
Any word how fire started? Foul play? Terror attack? Some stupid tourist? What what?
The God of Abraham has grown weary of this idolatry... He is a jealous God...
😲😥
VIVE LA REVOLUTION !!!!!
They say they are going to need a lot donations in order to rebuild. What I don't understand is why didn't they have fire insurance? Especially since they had over 700 years to get the insurance.
Another museum goes up in flames, because it stopped being a church long time ago,just like all the other cathedrals in Europe have because tourists attractions,the traditional church is dead ,Jesus Christ lives and does not abide in those dead cathedrals
This is so terrible to happen to such a historic icon.
Nothing to do with Islam?
Какие придурки допустили это? Поубивал бы!
How the fire broke out??Allah save everyone
Lol
Lol
OOF
MUSLIMS DID THIS. Mark my words.
im gonna make a joke but I genuinely feel bad
Spent 200 years to build and burnt down in like 20 sec
it was arson or Frances building and safety regulations are garbage. how could you be so careless not to have a fire extinguisher close by when renovating one of the most famous buildings on earth... this is a sad day seeing something so historic be destroyed
Why are MSM not mentioning that earlier this month the historic Church of St Sulpice in Paris was set ablaze by an act of arson, as reported by Newsweek magazine?  Newsweek  ran a story about Catholic churches in France suffering recent acts of desecration and vandalism since the beginning of this year.
Kinda ironic that this happened almost a week before Easter? I believe that they were there getting ready for service? This is so sad and I will be praying. 🙏🏼
DUES VULT

Muslims said we would pay after the Christchurch shooting
一百多年前，英法联军烧了圆明园，你们见过圆明园的样子吗，如今，这是他们自己人所为。
Judging by the pathetic and gullible comments people don't seem to realize... the grenfell fire was mostly Muslim inhabitants but that was an accident. This is purposeful
That's diversity for you. I’d be looking at the motives of “Mohamed's Roof Restoration”, who were lead contractors on the re-roofing job or perhaps the "Muslim Boy Scouts climbing club" visit that just happened to be there right before closing when the fire started.
INNNTTRESTING  ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉).

Well, I guess Satan joined the chat, no offense
Just for the record:  Watched CNN tonight (just cause it was on at the gym).  They were reporting on this horrific fire story and I though, "Well, at least they're actually reporting news for once and not constantly bashing our president."  Then I read the title of the story:  "Trump Knows Better Than Parisian Firefighters?"  Is there a tragedy these people wont stand on?
why did she disgrace it with that pronunciation. It’s not “No-ter Daim” it’s “No-tre -Daam”
I bet that's not the real crown of thorns. Lol. Just more nonsense. Nobody died or was hurt so I don't care.
I can’t take all these freakin sickos anymore,all the hate,and ignorance ,it’s ridiculous already 😒
White guy must've snuck in and read the real history
Christians in the Christian countries should become strong Christians. Hindu temples should be demolished and ban should be put on idol worship and snake worship. It is igniting the wrath of God because idol worship is unpardonable sin and snake is considered Satan in Christianity.
875 CHURCH FIRES IN FRANCE IN 2018? CBS FAKE NEWS NO REPORTS ??
#HANGTHETRAITORS
How does that happen, that would never happen to something like the White House or the Vatican. What a terrible loss.
Accident or terrorist attack ?
This is so crazy, but NOT as crazy as hearing that a Muslim man threw a 5yr old AMERICAN boy ...that he took from his parents... Off the 3rd floor balcony at the Mall of America in Minnesota !! This Islamic problem must be addressed.
I wonder how long it will take for the French anti-Semites to blame the fire on the Jews.
Apparently in Jerusalem about the same time a Mosque also caught on fire too, so theres that.
So what comes after all this pedophile bullcrap is what Truthers want to know...Wow...Insane up the Waterfall land of truth...This crap never stops...Amazing life of knowledge...We beat the devil...We need to stick together into next infinite awesomeness land ...This thing never stops...We will get a break and truth gut when the gross comes out...I promise..J
The muslims set it on fire
Who wants to bet they tear it down and build a mosque.
nah its just a building. World is burning my friends and ocean is full of plastic. But u guys cry over mere BUILDING!!!
CBS has the nerve to wonder why people call them Fake News when they make up things that didn't happen in the title of a simple youtube video.  Only ONE SITE was burned, the fire did NOT "burn through Paris".  Get the facts right or shut the channel down, people are sick and tired of opinionated embellishments on the news.
I bet it was an american who hates Notre Dame football.
I wish Americans would stop the mispronunciation of this name....ask someone if you don't know.Notre Dame
I feel sad 
Another European Culture that was ruined.
Nobody care about French weapons being used in Yemen to destroy entire cities and killing children. ..it's very sad what has happened to Norte Dame... heart of art , culture and heritage but this is karma reminding you of how it feels like having monuments of your heritage destroyed in front of your eyes. ..cathedrals could be rebuilt but 9 year old child lost leg by bombs can't
Until yesterday, it was called Notre Dame...
Today, the world now shall know it as...
NOTRE FLAME! 😎
Wow where they were crowned...
Yet again we let muslims burn down another piece of Western Culture. France you know what you gotta do. Show the rest of Europa that you reject the jewish game of race replacement.
It used to be my favorite😢. R.I.P😦 LIKE IF YOUR WITH ME😭
I wonder if anybody has asked the contractor what happen? Did you see all that scaffolding was ridiculous looking, was it necessary to put some much up. I feel sorry for Paris because they were trying to fix it up, and it burn down
Why this is in news.. Making money out of it. No one cares what happened to greenfall and many people died.. Wtf..
GUYS XXXTENTACION IS ALIVE!
Exactly what Democrat/Socialist/Globalist want
My brother’s in Paris...
This is proof that our  world is round.
THIS IS FOR ALL OF THE FRENCH ATROCITIES IN HAITI! 😍😍😍😍
Religion of peace boysssss
Not one French was crying over ancient Roman artifacts when isis was destroying them.
Did quazimoto die
This sucks.
They need to give Africa back all the art they stole

I hope no one is hurt! However.... the "church" or "cathedral" looked kinda evil to me to be honest with all the gargoyles. Annnnnd if its Gods will for it to burn down then....... Thy will be done.
Horrible...
Welp, it's proof. God hates Christians. 
Bahahaha
Notice how it burned exactly a week before catholic Easter







And I’m not even Christian
Subhanalloh
I hope the new Mosque looks just as good.
“I MUST BURN ALL OF PARIS “







😉
im glad to see that eye sore gone, it was a decayed tooth and im thrilled it was pulled today.
and no matter how its rebuild, it will always be second best.
CBS is so irrelevant.
Call it an accident, but there is NO WAY that fire got white hot in that short of a time. Something happened intentionally. I saw the entire live feed and something major happened. This isn't a candle tipping over. If it's Islamic related, France will freak out against the migrant flow.
Y'all got tears for idolatry, but no tears for the true Yasharal
I just want to know how this even happened. I hate that this is true, but my first thought was terrorist attack. But they don’t say mention anything like that so hopefully I’m wrong. Gosh such a beautiful piece of history lost.
Someone give this professor an energy drink.
😥😥😥
This is so sad, Alexa play God's Plan
Who gives af
Meh
Meh.
This was not an accident, Muslims have been starting fires 🔥 and media has been covering it up, people need to know that WW3 has already started and mass migration is the first faze, time to wake up!
france's greatest accomplishment, a stone building that burns down XD

Burn every church on the planet to the ground. Religion has held back humanity for millennia.
This was horrible reporting as usual. They don't answer all 6 basic questions: who, what, where, when, why and how. Not even "we aren't sure how". Nope. Just avoid it. Instead, they put on the most boring history professor to dull our interest, and I like history. I had to stop listening. You would think with all the rare objects there, they would have at least installed a sprinkler system. Something is amiss in paradise.
Very tragic. Even if they fix it, the original beauty that has been for hundreds of years is gone forever. This horrible fire is another sign that the Apocalypse is near.
This happens after France officially recognises Palestine and the Israeli President says it is a "grave mistake". 🤔
Kathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris ist abgebrannt , tja das ist eben halt die spät und gerechte Strafe von Gott und Satan für die verlorene Kreuzzüge und die Sache mit den Gegenpapst immer und der Abendländische Schisma . mfg eure conny
Muslims fanatics tried to burn Notre Dame two years ago. Are they involved?
Hi,
I am looking for a place to stay. My last accommodation is now unavailable due to smoke damage. A one bedroom apartment high up is preferred. Please contact me ‘Hunchback of Notre Dame at +33036748586.
Awaken, Europe
The Catholic church created this bad karma and we all know why!
A sign God is furious at those priests for molesting all those innocent children and the Catholic churchs coverups of the scandal
Feel symbolic and like an attack of some sort. France is going through crazy times
Sad sad sad !!!!!!!!!!
One Cathedral =five mosques
Thank God
millions of people question CBS news and what you all cover...Why are not all covering real facts and truth...Why is you leadership following fakeness, and falseness?...  Your company is in big doo doo because when the truth comes out ....WOW....wait till people keep following the hundreds of millions following joe rogan, logan, alex jones, and the rest of real humanity...you guys are NUTS TO CONT. Fake NEWS,,,if you think people do not have a brain...WOW...Wake up people...War is on
According to Trump, If the French just raked their cathedrals, the fire could have been averted.  It's a cathedral management issue.
Terrorists
what if they just pray the fire away???
That's definitely not an accident either the muslims or the leftist  , that's guaranteed . . They will say it's an accident and people believe , and before that there were 10 churches burned by "accidents"  over the last year . Enjoy the muslims...  Your Lebanese Christian brother
An image of the spiritual reality of post Christianity.....interesting that the mosque covering the temple mount in Jerusalem was burning at the same time time  - for those who are awake - pray very much!
Good
Look at the smoke who's the new pope
Dang it Frolo.
The Age of Aquarian requires MAJOR changes. The old buildings built on corruption must fall. It is bigger than Paris.
I see a lot of hatred by muslims (especially by turks) connected this event. I respect Your belief, but I can't find anything to be happy in this
Man someone else beat me to it😂😂😂
Thanks for the likes people
I'm glad it burned :)
Macron and his Rothschild Illuminati bossed did this 🤬😡👿‼️
Ik they’re HEATED  🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♂️
Then trump tweets "just dump water tankers on it" wow we have a spart President
I better not here that a Islamic Temple is gonna replace this old church that would be going to far to soon.
No one:

Fire: I'm about to end your whole career
Man those black metal bands are making their rounds...
200 year for a cathedral but the pyramids took 20 years lol
I can’t believe the entire government of France can’t muster up some firefighting helicopters that lift water from nearby rivers or drop fire retardant powder. Clearly no plans for potential emergencies. Shame
So they finally managed to summon Satan in there. Lord help us all.
Tragic.  God seems to be warning France to go back to its catholic roots.
it shows lack of leadership in the country to protect what is important
Terrorism? How did it happen? Someone smoked a joint and didn’t put it out right? But really, it sounds like a jihadi wet dream to burn it to the ground, they love to destroy any and all historically important objects and locations relevant to western culture
I hate how they had Quasimodo locked away but so happy he got out before this fire :/
V ..
The world has become mostly secular so it doesn’t matter.
Just a building
Big day for black metal fans
Roses are red
I was at school
Then there was a fire
At the Notre Dame Cathedral
What goes up must eventually come down. "God" doesn't dwell in temples built by human hands anyway.
It is indeed not healthy to come up with conclusions at this stage, and having doubts is helpful but I know one thing for sure: the official explanation will be as laughable as it will be an utterly dishonest coverup.
I smell foul-play....
The fire will divert attention for Theresa Mays debacle on Brexit.....
Seems like a pay back for New Zealand Mosque terrorism attack. Good job to anyone who did this.
Mob grieving should have been turned off
Maybe they'll put up a Jacque in the box in its place
At least one Italian criticised Gothic architecture as Germanic and thus barbaric.   Classical architecture of Rome and Greece might be more durable against fire. All masonry and no wood.


Gothic architecture was known during the period as opus francigenum ("French/Frankish work"),[2] The term "Gothic architecture" originated in the 16th century, and was originally very negative, suggesting barbaric. Giorgio Vasari used the term "barbarous German style" in his 1550 Lives of the Artists to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,[3] and in the introduction to the Lives he attributed various architectural features to "the Goths" whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered Rome, and erecting new ones in this style.[4]
Lol don't worry guys it's a part of God's plan. How can it be sad.
“BY THE POPE!!!”,said the stunned crusader.
Let it burn
I wonder if this had anything to do with muslims...
God is already angry for humans used his house of worship for their greed, power and decit amassing money frm the poor for their personal luxurious lifestyle
It was the Hunchback, I said he shouldn't be allowed matches.

Don't forget the French slavery to Africa and the aggression against Asia. The destruction of the treasures of mankind in the Yuanmingyuan. This is a retribution for the French.
Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire burned the Chinese Yuanmingyuan in 1900. Don't forget your shameless acts.
I love it. Religion is burning up in flames. after centuries of oppression the church are getting what is coming to them: extinction. Good riddance.
It's just a building.

1 Corinthians 3: 

"16Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? 17If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple."
So wheres quasi-moto gonna stay now ?
Maybe someone started the fire to get the peoples attention to the church so they can rebuild it.
Xi Jinping's last visit to France was disgraced. This illiterate fool is narrow-minded, evil has no bottom line, China's disasters continue, Xi Jinping has a crisis of trust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, will it???
So called religion of peace up to no good I reckon.
The hunchback of notre dame is the only place where the cathedral still lives
Who cares anymore FOLKS?  Just Tell the Friggan Truth...You are protected be God the Creator
Image all the sins that happened n that building....
Looks like a new Pope was elected
blah blah blah lets see it on fire. if its on fire at least show it
Karma exists
Investigations are underway.  I hope they tell us the truth about HOW the fire started. There has been many attacks on churches and even on Nortre Dame before, so terrorism should NOT be crossed out.
Priceless meaning, religion is a bogus made up construct by man to control MAN.  Ugh.
Karma

This is the wonderful history of France. What a brilliant fire.
who else only knows thus because of assassins creed unity
The guy in the gray hair, looks like the church lady from SNL.
Let it BURN ! 🔥🔥🔥 Just another Cursed, evil temple of DOOM ...
Hahahah,that's totally undoubtely a captivating view when I saw the fire. How fascinating it is, isn't it?
Chicken Little....the sky is falling!, the sky is falling!...I must tell the King!!
as an atheist I think of the pure historic importance of this building and the fact that in modern times we could not save a building survived   750 years a building that was still in use by modern people in a modern city with modern technology...it seems somewhat biblical.
Islam owns the ground and have plans for a new Mosque,the end of France,the end of Christianty!!!
Wow. Science really did beat Christianity.
This is what happens when they tell you illiegals are peaceful!!!
This is planned thing did by jewish puppet Macton!
Lionhearth legacy of the crusaders
Hopefully the white guy gets out of CBS studios without getting punched. This clown show of an organization has been inciting racial violence lately!
Notre Dame Cover-up Begins



The cause of the fire at Notre Dame cathedral has not been determined and may never be. All of the evidence appears to have been destroyed.

But that doesn’t stop the Fake News international media from declaring immediately that the fire was “an accident” and that anyone who disagrees is a conspiracy theorist. This is intended to smear anyone like  who suspects possible terrorism. Reuters reported:



...The fire that tore through Notre-Dame cathedral was probably caused by accident, French prosecutors said on Tuesday after firefighters doused the last flames in the ruins overnight and the nation grieved for the destruction of one of its symbols...



Yet nobody knows what caused the fire. So they cannot say that it “was probably caused by an accident”. No honest investigator is allowed to draw such a biased conclusion before any investigation has begun. A reputable investigator would say that “all possible causes are going to be investigated”.



CNN Business reported:



... Even before the blaze at Notre Dame was extinguished, conspiracy theories and fake news about the fire had ricocheted around the internet.



The most egregious examples of misinformation originated in the darker corners of the internet but many found bigger audiences on social media.



One prominent conspiracy theory revolved around the claim that the fire had been deliberately started.

InfoWars, a fringe website which is known for spreading conspiracy theories, published a story which suggested the fire had been intentionally set.



The claim was based on a single erroneous tweet, which was later deleted. The InfoWars story remains online.



Paris Prosecutor Rémy Heitz said that while the cause of the fire has not been established, it was likely "accidental."



"Nothing shows that it's an intentional act" he said in a press conference on Tuesday...



This claim is absurd since nobody knows how the fire started. Therefore the cause could be anything from an accident to a terror attack. And we know for certain that terrorists want to harm Europe and Christians in any way possible, particularly at the beginning of Easter Holy Week.



But the Fake News media do not want anyone even mentioning that it was possibly a terrorist attack in order to protect radical muslims. Two Fox News anchors, Neil Cavuto and Shepard Smith, both cut off guests who suggested that the fire could have been intentional.



This “accident” narrative could in fact be the beginning of a cover-up conspiracy by the international media of a deliberate terrorist arson. 

Like any honest investigation we should consider all possible causes. And until one or another is ruled out we cannot say what caused the fire.



The media, of course, are saying correctly that the fire started at the site of construction on the cathedral’s roof/attic area but then go on to say that some type of construction-related accident was obviously the cause.



Nonsense. Quite the opposite, in fact. During the renovation many more people had access to the roof area than at any other time. A radical construction worker like an anti-Christian communist or a muslim sympathizer or a radical French muslim laborer working on the project could have started the fire. The fire itself could have been a muslim conspiracy involving many people.



But reports say that nobody was at the work site at the time...



Yes, but bombs and incendiary devices can be set off by cell phones and we know that arson has been used as a tool of terrorism in recent years.

The international media are going to do everything in their power to call this “an accident” in an all-out effort to defend muslims.



Don’t believe it!! Anything is possible. This media action could be the biggest conspiracy of all to distract us from a terror strike on the heart of French Christianity.
yes it`s a shame but parts of France have been burning for 22 weeks not as much said about that, just brushed under the carpet as much as they can
It’s pretty lit Rn 😎
burn baby burn ......the symbol of atrocities by the catholic church against so many ashes to ashes ..
Inside job. Bush did 4/15
this is very not epic
Why did it have to happen before Easter!!!!! It's so much fun on easter
Oh dear. A home for paedophiles burnt down. Worra shame. X
Blow your nose my. My god.
Lets mfk burn !!!!
The illuminati tried to take it down 
But they don't know that you cant take down what is invincible

If anyone saw a Middle Eastern man near that fire, it was probably Jesus.  I hope they had fire insurance.
Islams?

Notre Dame has been through trauma after trauma and has always been rebuilt. In the long run, this isn't much different than anything else that's happened to it in the past 800 years.
Vandalism, multiple fires, multiple revolutions and riots, religious insurrections, etc.
Some people did something again
We sure didn't make this fuss when bombs destroyed Aleppo.
Lord Jesus. Hope everyone okay there
rip. why arent the french so responsible THEY LET A HOME OF CHRIST BURN DOWN.
Helps to put it on 1.25 speed to decongest that first guest.
Did quasimodo make it out? Im very worried
Sudden urge to listen to Hellfire.
Great news!  Fabulous to see the fall of religion.  Burn baby burn.🔥🔥🔥
Bro it’s the hunchback of notre dame in real life
Such beautiful art and history. If I said that the Cathedral should be demolished permanently, then you might call me crazy.
But if you had the insight that I do, and the analytical ability to calculate future Paris population demographics, then you would know that under Macron's leadership.....the out-breeding cult lead Army of Islam will convert the Cathedral into a Mosque in just a few more generations.   Just as Islam has already done with hundreds of other Catholic churches across Europe !!!
You can rebuild the fallen spires.....but Islam will convert them into minarets.
nooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!! Wait Notre Dame is real?!
So glad that The Most High is proving that catholicism is not His religion James 1:26/27 get ready for the ride down Jepheth Gen. 10:5 and more expressly everyone who made that United Nations agreement Psalms 83:4. France has been disrespectful to TMH remember in the 1500's when they removed Him from their constitution what can lady liberty the goddess of heaven do now. Watch what God builds up and what man the man of sin trys to do Revelation 13
This week on "watchya doin rabbi" we are visiting a 12th century cathedral to light a fire in the heart of old France, as New French look on and cheer.
I for one am happy this has happened lol 😂 and that is my freedom of speech!!
Hey maybe you can cover the yellow vest while your there. It's been 22 week now and not a peep from MSM.
"NOTER DAIM"

anyone that knows french: 🙄
The Disney version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame was way better.
Act of God
Macron must be loving it.  There is nothing unpopular Politicos like more in a time or their own unpopularity better than something to unite people.  Harsh but so true. Aye.. Believe it.
LOL holy crap... This thing is still burning?!
Migrant workers were hired and they left a burning blowtorch on site.  Never let Muslims near your places of worship.
This fire symbolism for the rise of the anti Christ!!
Just wait until the leadership at CBS wake up to the Devil stuff...It will be a wake up Moment I We hope...Wake up Bosses..We love you too..Wake up Boss..Then it is Game Over to the Establishment Hoaxers ...lol...I and We hope this is the "End Game to all of this"
Hopefully Esmeralda will save the cathedral.
The ends comin and i think this time foreal
🎶Burn baby burn
    Burn baby burn🎶
France is a failed state
Why didn't God help the firefighters by making it rain? Oh, wait, there is no God 😂
Its about time God let that pagan building burn .
Babylon the Great has fallin! Symbolic of how God is judging the harlot church of Rome!
The way the first newscaster pronounces 'notre dame' is extremely infuriating...
Some people, did something...
Catholics burning their records. Not surprised. 5% of all of their priests molested kids regularly. Don't believe their BS about not being able to fight the fire earlier.
Yup.  There goes the neighborhood..
Guys IT was a Terror attack
NOW WE PAGANS WILL BUILD A TEMPLE FOR US TO PRAISE THE TRUE GODS ON THE ASH OF THAT USELESS BUILDING!!!!!! DO NOT FORGET CHRISTIANS HAVE DONE THIS TO EVERY NATIVE BELIEF FOR TOO LONG!
SKÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅÅL!!!
Typical Nothing like seeing Christian comments bashing another religion
Hahaha... Calling this an accident huh?
Maybe it's an omen to the fall of the white race and Europe as a whole
The seventh incarnation of God. And supposed to be the first birth of moments of beauty.
Let it BURN!!!!!
I bet the pagans will mourn the loss.
Survived 2 world wars and burns down due to a renovation error? Obviously not all the facts are in yet but something already seems fishy. Theres been a string of arsons in that area for a few months now.
OH NO MY MINECRAFT WOOD HOUSE, WHO WAS THE FKER
nipsey hussle death has something to do with this
If only the same occured to mosques worldwide
Would be tears of joy.
Empty trump towers deserve this treatment, not the Notre Dame. 😡😡😡😡😡
Fear God
Its a building and not important.
Pure political set up... demolish it to erect new building to gain more... cant you see people it is pure intentional
Just a building!
Where’s quasi!?! Is Esmeralda ok...God! Where’s quasi!
I don’t understand why people crying.  Nobody killed.  It’s a building nothing more.
Fire Sprinklers save lives and buildings! But let me guess? You were grandfathered in weren't you. It would cost too much for "us" to pay for the fire sprinklers, but now we can get taxpayer money to install them for free"to us of course". You see folks its much easier to socialize the loss/bennefit for those in power.
This is so sad.... But somehow Donald Trump will be blamed.
A mosque will probably be put in its place
Its time to destory esau
To me, this is symbolic of the energetic changes that have been taking place worldwide (climate change - environmental, religious, economic.....) and hopefully and end to domination and control. Best wishes
We shall rebuild god wills it
Why would god let this happen?
Let's just say history repeats itself the yellow vest movement then the Notre Dame cathedral burnt little suspicious if you ask me only thing I'm going to say Germany Reichstag
God is doing his job
Hey, burn it in fiction, not in real life! not cool. keep it in the movies.
There’s goes all the prof of children molesters!!! How convenient it burns down with no answers to questions the church has hurt young children!!!!!
“Notre damn”
Probably done by the hunchback
Donald Trump came out singin Billy Joel
Any word on if this was a Jihadist hit on a Major Symbol of Christianity?
Muslims were involved, how do you burn stone? Catholic churches have been vandalized for the last decade. it's these "invaders". the fire started 15 minutes after the last person left the church!
Is there a prediction told by Nostradamus about this?
Now the trump cathedral is the tallest in Paris.
The house of Satan himself burned 👇.
Laughs in German
Import Islam, import terrorism.
I heard they were rioting over there because of the economy, and the media is trying to keep it quiet. so it won't spread. Also, I hope no one was hurt. Buildings can be replaced people can't.
Let it burn.
The art was a reminder..ppl have forgotten!! why care for the art you never appreciated now thats its gone?
immigration is at the root of why this happened
It means the end of superstition. Yet what a glorious building on par with the light house of Alexandria and the colossus of Rodes. It should be rebuild, yet via Vatican money.
God burned it down, thou shall not worship idols!!!!
It’s 2019. No sprinkler system? WTF?
French protestors did this. Not Muslims 😂😂😂😂
Burn baby burn.
all those used condoms burning up in smoke. Oh  well.
Who put it on fire how horrible...Satanic def not on accident
Can’t be renovated, can’t be rebuilt.  The most casual condo-development renovation has better fire controls in place than this did.  The official story smells to high heaven.
People I`m telling the truth. This was done by turks because in April 24 
 there should have been a ceremony dedicated to the Armenian genocide.Turks have to be revenged
Is sad. Suation But the crown was not Jesus. Is just a hoaks
Wait until the upper Bosses at Macy's, Dillards, CBS, Amazon, etc "Wake UP"....wait until this demon like possesion types wake up to wtf is going on...the people know wtf is going on...if the bosses do not listen to the base then it it "Game OVer to the awake masses"...such big time for humanity
It was built with blood money , stone , so why did it burn.
Religion of peace folks. This certainly wasnt an act of terror. Nothing to see here!
Oh no. Were they able to save the Masonic flooring in the chapel along with all the gargoyles on those towers?
In China a mosque was destroyed by the Chinese government... days later fire sets ablaze to this cathedral. Allah has given a warning and a sign.
That he should burn down until the ground like the twintowers
Looking at how France's political conditions are, I bet a Mosque will be built in its place because that's what's 'right' these days
Let it burn its a building
Side bets.... Arson! The slime that has infested Paris and Europe too probably will argue a mosque should be erected in its place MF'n POS. NEVER!
How many thousands and thousands of people were killed on THE CRUSADES by the same hands that build this cathedral and on the same period. Is not a cathedral of LOVE, it was build upon HATE. The most ironic thing is that they burned the people alive including innocent woman and children. Is the second time this cathedral burns. Maybe a legacy of evil shouldn’t remain upon us no matter how beautiful and creative looks, so we can move forward with the legacy of the hands of JUSTICE and UNCONDITIONAL LOVE. Let's just be thankful no more ALTAR BOYS will be RAPED or SEXUALLY ABUSED any more.
So you don’t steal oils from Syria....
Who cares its not like france is a western christian nation anymore. Kind of fitting actually.
People still have religions?
No one cares about the structure what group or religion did this?
The fire suggests that God does not like the pagan Catholics. Maybe? I'm more apt to believe a hater of western culture had possession of a lighter and a can of gasoline.
Punition de Dieu suite à vos mariages homosexuels là
Just my opinion , but ALOT of dark things have been happening since France allowed those Syrian refugees in, just like Lebanon  and Netherlands, and many others . This was not an accident or the last I promise that.
a bunch of queer baits run the place......God just started the place on fire....
muslims at work
I guarantee the media already knows who’s responsible for this lost!!!! It’s the creeping sharia effect!!!!! Wake up France!!!
I really dislike how Americans cover news stories. Especially when it's European news.
That place was full of demons and Idols, I'm glad the was destroyed. 😃
This was NO accident. Check out how many Churches have been attacked in France this year alone. By MUSLIMS.
lol muslims cheering and laughing about a satanic temple being burnt.. is that irony or what?
Priceless historic cathedral? For what, for tourist to see?  How many people go and see this church to worship Christ other than to just roam inside it and admire its architectural structure? God probably struck this church since it has no other purpose other than to just attract tourists and not followers and believers.
French people been saying that this is their 9/11, wich is an absolute bullcrap. So all the dead people in NYC is a much worth as a symbolic religion cathedrale / church. People donate already 100 million euro for a building... I dont care if it was a catholic, islam or ghandi or any fantasy religion them believe in, but where in the world millions of kids are starving you dont ever hear about. 

They say the heart of paris been hit...  wasnt the Eiffel tower the heart... or better the arc the triomp...  I been in Paris and yes it was a nice building to see, but dont say it as 9/11 or to donate millions for A building... wich the french can pay themselves.
Now it’s all going to be imports and mosques. About time to start Christian crusades and whipe out libtards and browns
OMG have you guys even been to Paris lately, its disgusting, the smell of urine everywhere and a million africans trying to scam you every 5 mins...let it burn its a freaking ghetto anyway.
People I`m telling the truth. This was done by turks because in April 24 
 there should have been a ceremony dedicated to the Armenian genocide.Turks have to be revenged

C'est la vie.
It's ridiculous y'all democrats are trying to get rid of all history
Let it burn!
In case you didn't know, Rome is going to burn to the ground too! Read Revelation...Catholicism aka Christianity, is the religion of Satan and fake white Jesus. The Hebrews and Jesus were black! The joke is on YOU for not reading the book for yourself.
God and Jesus be like:🙁☹️😟😣😖😩😫😤😥😰😨😱😡🤬🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
seems like this God person might have prevented this from happening.  that is a sacred place.
muslims
that's god's punishment for MULTICULTURALISM AND ISLAMISATION OF FRANCE AND EUROPE !!!
Horrible tragedy.  This was 10,000x worse than 9/11. Just terrible.
French will be a minority within 50 years anyways. Europe is already dead, who cares.
