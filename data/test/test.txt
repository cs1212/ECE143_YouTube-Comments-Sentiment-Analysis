im from that 1% that came here for onerepublic
Out of ten I’d give this song a...... Eleven 


K bye
I'm convinced OneRepublic don't know how to make a bad song
Lacks demogorgon in the lyrics
Stranger Things, Kygo and OneRepublic, could it be better?
Who came here because of Stranger Things
Kygo's music always gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling that everything will turn out just fine :)
Everyone needs some Kygo in their playlist
"Stranger Things" 
(feat. OneRepublic) (lyrics)

Stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
'Cause that's just who we are

We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now

Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday

I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down

Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get together
Someday
Someday

A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
'Cause that's just who we are
...
If Kygo and Owl City made a song that would be fucking amazing
I just got an eargasm
kygo most underrated guy in music history
Im convinced Kygo's "Kids In Love" is inspired by Netflix's Stranger Things <3
When you're a fan of Kygo, One Republic AND Stranger Things and you're not let down
if you think titling this song “Stranger Things” was gonna make me click.. then you goddamn right.
"We left the life that's ordinary from the start, we look for stranger things cause that's just who we are "

This song takes you into another world. Love it!
Who keeps hitting the repeat button?  MEE
I love Kygo's Stranger Things and Netflix's Stranger Things <3

Give it a try it's worth 😆
LYRICS:
Far, for stranger things, a life, a life of stranger things (very far) for stranger things (dreams of places I've) 'Cause that's just who we are

We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
How we're gonna get out
I remember

We dreamed of places that we could go
Castles with a strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

We left a life that's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things 'cause that's just who we are
Find me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now

Castles greater under Spanish skies
Well I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday (someday)

I see a technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it

You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things 'cause that's just who we are
Find me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down

Castles greater under Spanish skies
Well I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday (someday)

For stranger things, a life, a life of stranger things (very far) for stranger things (dreams of places I've) 'Cause that's just who we are (x5)
Who seen all episodes of ST2?
Eleven out of ten 👍
Eleven would love this
Who else here watches the show  Stranger Things??
I can't go one day without listening to this song. Listening to this song at night while overlooking the city is something that has to be experienced. It is so true, the stranger things in life can definitely be more beautiful than love itself if you know where to look ^_^ Great song!
One Republic is life 😍
Kygo 😍😍😍😍
Did kygo steal my Eggo's maybe??
Ryan Tedder's voice fits everything.
No one still listens to this but me
2019??
◢ ◤ RIP Avicii ◢ ◤ 
He inspirated Kygo, to make Music too.

RIP Legend D:
Came here after listening to stranger Things - All The Best Songs, not disappointed!
emotional 
really loved it
thank you very much  for this song
this music just take my mind to 

 
loved it 
really thank you from the bottom of my heart
it makes me imagine a distant travel I love it. Especially the theme of moving to unknown fields. We did a cover and music video with just those thoughts and maybe some fans here can share their thoughts on how we interpreted the song :) I would appreciate it a lot :)
Stranger Things 😍.
Kygo + OneRepublic = Masterpiece ❤▶🎶
I LOVE THIS SONG and then i realized that 
it was published the day my boyfriend and I became in love
Why am i seeing Netflix's Stranger things ad when i play this






OH WELL!!!
I don't understand how isnt this so popular. Kygo and 1R are 🔥 and only 6 millions after 1 month
I am depressed....
I came to hear this.......its so REFRESHING
Kygo & OneRepublic :D <3 The track is so relaxed! :-)

P E R F E C T  SONG
When your favourite Band and your favourite Dj works together you Gotta Love IT
Now I'm intrested in Stranger Things.
Who is waiting for official video...
I'm in love with this Song❤️
This is so relating to the series, stranger things.

SPOILER ALERT VVV

"We used to run around this ghost town" relating to the boys with their bikes when they always cycled around Hawkins.
"How we're gonna get out" It relates to Will when he's in the Upside Down and he's trying to communicate with Joyce and everyone else to get out of the Upside Down.
"Castles with the strange glow" When Eleven went to Castle Byers in season one and found Will there when she was communicating with him with her mind, The demogorgon came again so that's the 'strange glow'
"People that we don't know" Eleven when she stayed at Mike's house and Lucas intended on not keeping her since she's a stranger
"We left a life that's ordinary from the start" That relates to how their lives changed when Will was missing, their life changed from ordinary to strange.
"We looked for stranger things 'cause that's just who we are" How Eleven was looking for the Mindflayer/Shadow Monster in season two and since she's also one of the 'strange things' in the series.

"But I'm just looking out for you tonight" How Mike was always calling Eleven for 353 days.


"I see a Technicolor shadow, underneath your window" When Eleven got out of the Upside Down and went to Mike's house in season two, the first chapter/episode.
"Just in case you don't know, I can see it" How Mike saw Eleven behind the window but the guys that were at his house were looking and searching everywhere for her.

"We turned our back on ordinary from the start" When they finally returned to being normal, but the Mindflayer/Shadow Monster came into their lives.

You're welcome.
Simplicity is the key to success. :)
The best song on the album

A good song overall but I don't think his style of music suits the progamme. They should've got Chvrches or Empire of the sun instead.
Is it really featuring OneRepublic or is it just featuring Ryan Tedder?

Kygo is a legend.
Stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are

We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

We left the light
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Like I'm picturing now

Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast among an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

We turned our back
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Show me the sky falling down

Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get together
Someday
Someday
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things (very far)
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are

We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are

But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday

I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know

[Verse 2]
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get together
Someday
Someday
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Bridge]
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (very far)
For stranger things (dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things (very far)
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (very far)
For stranger things (dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (very far)
For stranger things (dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (very far)
For stranger things (dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are

[Outro]
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things (very far)
For stranger things (dreams of places I've)
'Cause that's just who we are

Stranger Things ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Bitchin
Kygo manda mt bem kygo é vida
kygo the best dj in the world
MAÑANA ESTO CUMPLE 1 AÑO

This song is incredible.... I absolutely love it !!!!!!!

We like stranger things 
Dream or places
I just love his voice. Am I the only one?
❤❤❤
Hi Kygo, today is my birthday, thank you for this wonderful gift! 😍
Thank you again, for all emotion you gave us with your skills.
Keep doing, man💪
Good luck with your new album✌️
Eleven/ 10
Is that Mike and Eleven on the cover orrr...?
on a scale of 1-10 this song is 011
Ryan Tedder never fails to amaze me.
YASSSSS
Sooo when's the music video going to come out?
Sooooooo goooooood
I love this song
011
any one thinking about something like this ?
The whole time I was thinking about how great this song would've been in life is strange: before the storm
1:00 omg
Grrr!!!!
Que buen tema 🎧🎶👌
Incredibile song! I don’t the words to describe it
Do the voices at 1:33-137 sound similar to those from Something Just Like This?
😍🎶🎵❤
this reminds me of Strangers Things tv show
07 April 2018
Also, Kygo play the piano with raging and this song, makes me want to make songs with the piano just like his.
This song takes me to the inverted world
Wow <3
Stranger Things
i love this song
favorite
Crazyy kygo
I love connection
BR ouvindo em  2018?
I actually love this song😊
kygo , You r awesome , not just as a musician but as a teacher to the new producers and as a person whom they can be inspired by ...
This song makes me feel like i'm in paradise
Music 🐙
Kygo, If I ever meet you, I’m gonna hug you.
So amazing 🙂
simple and awesome!
This song is so good.
First time listening to this song and I love it!
2019?
I always defined electro music with high intensity music and fast beats. But this song has managed to easily change it. It's electro and yet so calm!
Uplifting
There are a few of Stranger Things in your song that are not related to Stranger Things in any way.
im not sure if this is based on the TV show or no...?
How you unlike it?
At 1:04 you close your eyes and get transported to another dimension.
❤💖
i'm here because one republic, but kygo isn't bad
Under 200 views
best song Ryan 1R kygo
one republic best group by far yes Ryan tedder
Song  going to  the  top  10   no mistake
this song is perfect
Kygo da best
2019!
很棒
i love you 😍
Stranger things fan here, but got here looking for OneRepublic songs.
Esta canción es muy relajante😍😌
If you say alan walker's remix is better then you are blind to europhic drops. The alan walker remix of this is just classic alan walker and was probably ghost produced anyway
2018 ?
Kygo pls make some tropical house again pls
My favorite song rn
STUNNING 💙
I'm just here for Ryan...
2:46 its   some thing just like this - coldplay melody
Temazo!
:1 :2 :3 :4 :5 :6 :7 :8 :9 :0 <3
Việt nam ơi 😘
Maybe Kygo Alan Walker and Rita ora and Demi Lavato
Love love
<3
sounds like a Coldplay song
I love it
Omg😍😍😍😍😍
like a stranger things like like the sranger things like a stranger things
Fantastic song
Mm stranger things ;)
Sponsor by Netflix
Who clickbaited beacouse of the Show? Me 😭
es la mejor cancion de todos los tiempos, no lo puedo creer , fue una magnifica convinacion y un gran tema
1:04 i love ittttt
Trending finally !!
◢ ◤
did anyone pressed just for the title of the song???!!
Ryan Tedder's outstanding voice is definitely the highlight of this song. Kygo's production on this is solid as well, but nothing we haven't heard before from him. Still, hopefully this will become a hit because both artists deserve it!
tranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
 
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
 
We left the light
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Like I'm picturing now
 
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
 
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast among an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it
 
We turned our back
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edges something beautiful than love
Show me the sky falling down
 
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking after you tonight
Snow and mountain to the ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get together
Someday
Someday
Oh oh
Oh oh
 
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things (very far)
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are
 
A stranger things
We're like, we're like a stranger things (very far)
We're stranger things (dream of places at)
Cause that's just who we are

MIKE
Ryan😍
UwU
Very Good Music..
I came for this one first before the netflix TV Series. 
I liked this song, so much. Then i felt like i must watch the tv series, then i watch. After that, i was feeling like, addicted by the tv series. Then i came to this one again, searching for the lyric meanings (genius), surprisingly this one is inspired by Stranger Things (TV-Series)
Another great work!!!
notification squad
is this connected to a tv show "stranger things" on netflix
BEAUTIFUL
What a Beautiful song a must have for every playlist!
So anyone have proof? besides the title and some lyrical meaning that this song was inspired by the show
Super Song
kygo the best in the tropical house has a great quality of music and the best a very well-known alternative band Onerepublic one of my favorites too. His songs are exaggeratedly good.
Impresionante OneRepublic con Kygo... Sin palabras
So so good
1 day 1 song ? Are u machine KYGO?
I LOVE kigo
Guess Kygo likes the series XD
😍💙😝✌😊🎶
stranger things
Eleven's real name is Jane

Lou kygo
Even better than the show!
I’m singing this while watching a certain show ;)

konuma gerek yok dardayım👌
I hate the fact that in the comments it talks about the netflix series "Stranger Things" when this has nothing to do about that
Amazing
Mauricio García
Very good! Зачетно ёпта хаха
Me imagino una colaboracion de kygo y Jonas blue, o entre sigala y matoma serían una de las mejores
Put it on your playlist
Kygo und OneRepublic, das wird ein Hit. Super!
حبيت
❤️
#notificationsquad where you at?

The kind of love that Mike and Eleven have, that is straight up goals. This song makes me ship them more.
