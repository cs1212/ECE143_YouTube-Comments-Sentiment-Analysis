Poor Gordon. Can't imagine what it's like losing your camera man...
Is this Gordon Ramsay's cameraman? Those over the top zoomed shots x)
INTERNET
The place that people judge food without tasting it.
I miss looking at Grant's buns...
They look a bit dry.
It looks good but I feel like there isn't quite enough filling for the amount of bread
Where's my boy grant at tho?
Come back ChefSteps! 😭
I'm not sure modifying a standard 'bun' recipe by adding a filling really counts as bao.
Love your videos, but please please use different music; this soundtrack was nauseating.
We missed you ChefSteps!
If you guys kept up with the content you had in the beginning. 5 mil easy subscribers.
What happened to the original crew? They felt like a family together....
Yay... great video guys... keep them coming please.. 😊
Finally ive been waiting so long for you guys to post more videos 😩😩
Great to see these kinds of videos again. Keep it up!
😃 @valeriavillasmusic
💜
Brilliant. They still need sous vide, but brilliant.
Show your face Nick!!! You are so talented!!
Guys! I'm so happy you're back!
Miss the beautiful natural lighting ..
So glad chefsteps is posting videos again!!!!!!
Soooooo next video in a year?
Must try making these. Thank you for the recipe!
How do you make that filling? looks delicious
Do some vegan recipes
First video didn't use natural light? Interesting.
RIP Grant ;_;
ehh the editing style is not as good as before
So happy you guys are back 😊🥂
Dang Perfect video
Loved the style of this one.
Sniper camera man
Bao down before the one you serve. Can't stop picturing Trent Reznor as a pastry chef now.
Just wondering, why do you press the top of the bun down? Thank you so much for new recipes!
We want Grant
Hambugers❗
Try steaming then deep drying until golden brown
My anaconda dont want none unless you got homemade filled buns hun...  BAO GOT BACK.. BAO GOT BACK.
Any ideas on other fillings?
Whats with the music?
Everything about this is beautiful. The way it’s filmed and the recipe! Can’t wait for more
They’re beautiful bao
IM EARLY
Are you guys back on the game???
First
Just a stuffed bread
This weird music bangs
bao should be steamed
Dear ChefSteps,

Please return to making videos like you used to. You carved out a particular niche where you didn't speak in the videos and instead focused on excellent camera work, custom made music for every video, and you made a great deal of effort in cooking unconventionally using molecular gastronomy to prepare your dishes. It was fun, interesting, and different than every other cooking show on YouTube. It wasn't about the chefs or relationships; it was about the science of cooking. I think I actually saw you guys use test tubes in some of your videos. I miss that.

Please, return to the videos that you used to make and stay away from conventional cooking. If we wanted to see that, we would go watch Gordon Ramsey. Thanks.
Dey baaaack
I can’t see
Any Asians on here watching this and going “whaaaa tf?”
Super nice
Bao me baby
Garbage hipster music. Jesus Christ this channel. ....
Really thrown off by why these "bao" where....baked??
But can I sous vide them?
Hey Chefsteps!!! I am a big fan of yours. I also like cooking at home. I am actually from the Philippines and can't purchase your sous vide tool "Joule". I was hoping you could give me one "Joule" because I would like to level up my cooking skills. If you just can't, it's fine, I can understand. But I really appreciate if you do. Contact Me sometime.
I feel like all the negative comments about promoting sous vide really affected their confidence
They look dry and hard. meh
manapua >> nikuman >> charsiu bao
I couldn't see anything about how many weeks I have to sous vide these :(
I don’t get it, Chefsteps used to be one of the best cooking channels on all of YouTube. Then they just fell off the face of the planet. What happened?
At what step do I put them in the sous vide?
Love it, I'm so happy you guys are back
Nice, I feel like spaetzle is under appreciated in general
actually, those small ones are called "knoepfle" in germany.
waaait.. where is the cheese and the onions? You need to make some true "allgäuer kässpatzen" 😄
In this trolling era there is so much negativity on a variation of a recipe. These days if a recipe isn’t a replica people got something to say! If it ain’t broke don’t fix it is not applicable to cooking. Cooking is a science and also instinctual so it can recipes that were passed down through generations and are subject to changes based on access to availability of ingredients etc
Traditionally Spätzle are made with ony flour, salt and whole eggs. But these look delicious too.
Yeah, chefsteps is back! And with a Classic German recipe (though the additional sour Creme was new for me)
Try to add mountain cheese to them and make them "Käsespätzle" caramelised onion on top and you are in heaven
never made Spätzle with sour cream but they do look pretty delicious!
As always the music is top notch and the cooking is superb
U need to prepare them like mac n cheese with deepfried onions this is traditional germen and called Käsespätzle
nice one!!
theres something similar to this in India, we call it boondhi.. 
its vegetarian and uses gramflour. The famous sweet called Laddu is made with it too.
YES! THEY ARE BACK!
Wow, what a beautiful video. Great Job
Hell yeah. Love geeking out to ur videos!
올챙이국수네
You're back!! Gosh I missed your videos
Thanks God you guys come back. Miss you!
Yes!!!!
올챙이 국수 ㅋ
Got a jager sauce to follow this up with?
awesome technique!
This is called nokedli in Hungary.
Eyy ChefSteps still killing it on the music front. I still miss Hans, but I'll take Nym lol
I missed these 😊
I love you guys so much.
Hurray for another video!
I don't understand... where's the sous vide?? This is a sous vide channel right? xD
shake that hobel bb
wtf?! sour creme?!
Boiled fried flour. K.
Feels like old school chefsteps is back
It looks like kind of noodle in Cantonese food and we call this “diving frog”.Lol
In Germany we use Spaetzle to make "Mac and Cheese" or rather Spaetzle with cheese sauce . Just as an idea what you can do with it.
Thanks! I always like to find new spaetzle recipes, in Switzerland we make them lots of different ways like with milk, with herbs or with various types of flours, spelt, chestnut, etc. Never tried with sour cream though, will try next time I make a batch.
Our german dich love :-)
You can call them spaetzle, we just call them "halušky" [halushkey]. It is a traditional side in my home country - Slovakia. Actually, our national dish is bryndzove halusky (halusky with special kind of fresh sheep cheese, sour cream and bacon croutons). Y'all should definitely try it ;)
you're the best food porn ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks unreal
You almost had me thinking i didnt need any special equipment for this one. Though i guess a piping bag or something will work
the spaetzle looks like my attempt at making ramen noodles with a similar technique like in this video. needles to say i failed... hard. spaetzle looks yummy
Браво!!!
Still alive?
i'm schvitzing over here. no...really...i am.
Nokedli with marhaporkolt.
wenn der Schwabe seine Spätzle schabt ist der Teig dicker und Schnickschnack wie nutmeg oder sour cream werden nicht gebraucht. trotzdem gutes und easy Rezept mit dem richtigen Gerät
Where’s the dude?
Where’s the sous vide?
Yummy
sorry the recipe has nothing to do with spaetzle 😉 but I like your channel😍👍
The right channel sounded off to me.  It sounded like most of the sound was coming from the left side.
Chefsteps > Tasty
@0:48 what a bad angle. What is that thing?
Wow. That is so far from the original Schwäbische Spätzle that I wouldn't even call this Spätzle....

The original recipe only contains eggs, water, flour and salt. And you want the dough to be thick not that thin.
what font did you use?
Any particular reason you put oil in the pasta water? Seems unnecessary
Yummmm!
Interesting; his is not the authentic German Spaetzle that I grew up eating
Guys, why did you add oil to the water?
I dislike Spetzle, the ingredients lack flavour : flour, butter, eggs, salt and nut meg. Where is the taste????!!!..... where is the love????!!!
So sorry that for but in Spaetzle you will never find 

-> nutmeg 
-> white pepper
-> sour  creme  

Finish up with butter and parsley is what Germans and Austria do same..
 

You need only flower eggs salt (a little bit of sparkling water) and normal water .. 

Mix and beat (!!) It all up 

That's all
what ... you didn't  SousVide it with Jules first?? dislike
lol too short for chef steps and not interesting enough for Tasty. is this the new video format?
Chefs Steps is definitely back ! Best Christmas ever
Hang on a second, when they poured the chocolate into the tart, it came from a bag not a bowl

THEY SOUS VIDE’D IT
I wonder why people complain about the use of sous vide so much here. Grant and crew put out high production quality videos that are free. So what if they want to capitalize on a product, through which they can monetize their efforts and continue to bring informative and entertaining content, why does it matter if they promote Joule? Sous vide is a great tool, like a microwave, or a blender, or a knife, or even a skillet.
So glad you are finally back!
You are back!! With such a lovely video and just great music 🎶 love it!
ANOTHER UPLOAD OH MY GOD HAVE YOU BEEN STOCKPILING VIDEOS FOR A YEAR OR SOMETHING 😍😍😍
You're back!
Now this is the content I'm here for! Absolutely stunning.
Happy to see vids again y'all.  Happy to see Nick but where is Ben ?
Utterly beautiful, as always. Great to have ChefSteps back up and running 👍 my appreciations for the crew on this comeback!!!
Welcome back! Thank you for the great recipe and video.
1:07 after that, smile.
Thank you for another great video!  Keep them coming!!
Omg I missed you guys so much! <3
The key is to sous vide your entire kitchen for 6 months at 65C beforehand. Otherwise this recipe will not work. Just pointing out the obvious.
For you this holiday season, everyone here at Chefsteps grew a beard. 
Happy Holidays.
Chefsteps.
where did you get those distance bars for rolling?
My heavens, that looks Devine! That made my mouth water.....
I love the baking and representing style of chefsteps ... And these recipes are full proof to try ..I never got fail if I try these recipes following every step..thank you soo much chefsteps to share.
Welcome back Chefsteps 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Is that food processor running while open?? 😱😱😱😱
wait, are you guys really back!`?
is this @ChefSteps way to ask us for a second chance? Im liking it so far!
Soo happy you have started making videos again. Such great quality on the videos and the recipes!
I feel like chefs use brandless spatulas I've seen them here and at tasty
The kings are back. Classic old school food porn with next level food.
So glad the recipes are back!!!
and just like that, they were gone
Give me a favor,
post more often☺☺☺☺
Wait, why did the filling go into a bag to be poured onto the crust, and why did a fork go into the oven and get baked next to the tart? I'm so confused.
I miss you Nick!!! Welcome back !! So happy to see ya !!
Easy-peasy. Gimme 3 minutes and I'll go make one
cant believe you're guys are back <3
This looks amazing, I can't wait to make it.
This looks delicious. Why egg wash the interior of the shell if you're already blind baking it though?
50 minutes for the shell alone ? Is there some kind of typo ?
I'm so happy that you guys are back :D
So good to see you back♡
I LOVE YOU GUYS
But i came for the sous vide method
It's 2 in the morning here but I love you.
Oooh that's nice!
I'm so happy you guys are doing food videos again.
Making this for New Years!
Love to see the beautiful videos  again guys! Keep it up!
Just so so so gorgeous omg love it
Great job guys!
Chefsteps, please dont leave us for so long ever again. We love you. Its just how it is.
Just plain SEXY!
This looks so amazing!
Great vid. Why are there always viewers  who are too broke to afford a hundred dollar cooking device that yields professional results? I don’t get it. If you work minimum wage it’s only one day worth of salary.
Must be delicious
Simple yet gorgeous
This is the Chefstep videos I love to watch!!
:D
Loving all the new content!
welcome back guys
OMG! Chefsteps is back! Best Christmas gift!
This is truly a Christmas miracle.
I'm so happy you guys started to make videos for youtube again
Chef steps are back. Best Christmas present
What happened to you guys? Focusing on your business and not your channel?
Finallyyyy we come backkk!
yay chefsteps is back
Why is there a fork in the oven?
i missed this kind of videosss
holy hell all these videos; sooooo goooood!
I literally have no idea what this channel is any more...
Back to your roots
@0:26 is that nick? We haven’t seen their videos in so long now he has a freaking beard
But why the fork in the oven?
You can fit so much booze into a choc filling like this #MoarBoozePlz
Would it be ok to use whipping cream instead of heavy cream? Would you need to adjust the quantity if doing so?
I must say the joy this channel's content brings when it's more than just a barrage of Joule infomercials. The thought of this channel returning to its early glory gives me tingles!
Waiting for joule.....
I often chuckle at the overwrought nature of ChefSteps techniques, but I have to ask: Why are you baking the fork?
Great to have you guys back!
Nice Steps
Beautiful.
thank god ive waited to make a chocolate tart... i couldnt find a nice enough recipe with a decadent center like that... THE TIME HAS COME my sous vide is waiting
I thought you guys quit making videos. Welcome back.
1:07 Sous Vide!
I could watch videos like that all day!
Yay!!! Nick is bhack!!!
I kind of wish sometimes that you cooked in a less precise, nicety nice, less tweezers-and-perfecly-measured-temps-and-weird-numbers-in-weight manner. Does that make sense?
I'll know they're really back when I see the centrifuge.
That chocolate shell... yum!
Commenters clearly need new material.
please bring back the synthy type music.
Looks tasty
Cool guys. love the video
It's cool that you guys are back but this content is just shitty Instagram food clips. Where are they actual in depth videos when interesting takes on classic ideas?
Alright yall if you read the recipe, it says they like to reserve the chocolate filling by keeping it warm by sous vide, so it was just a method of keeping it warm whilst they worked on other things, the were not cooking it
Where’s the measurement for all this?
Please keep this going and don't leave on this again
Why do the pattern in the crust?
use a microplane to shave down your crust for a cleaner straight edge
Where can I find pastry flour?
Did you guys make ice cream with LIQUID NITROGEN? So very geeky and awesome.
Huh? Are you trying to trick us? Why is the chocolate suddenly in a bag, did you sous vide it, if so, why show  bain-marie?
NOTIFICATION SQUAAAAAADD!!!!!!!!!
Wow more ! Me likes thanks !
Oh how the mighty have fallen, you used to make exciting enlightening videos, now it's just a platform for joule. I get you need to market your product but on every video? Really? Have you run out of ideas?
how would the egg not scramble when u put it into the hot chocolate??? im confused
Why make the holes decoration on the bottom if you won't see them after pouring chocolate over them?
Great recepie. Thank you '-)
First
All hail Chefstep 

Without joule
YES!!!!!!
I saw the bag, I know you used the sous vide, why are you hiding it from us!!!
notification!!  my videos are inspired by your techniques! thanks guys!
Keep onnnnnnnn !!!!!! Thanks a lot for this kind of end to an year! Cheers from Brazil!
3 videos in such a short period of time. what year is it
wow, welcome back! this was epic
Sometimes startups lose their compass, but then they find it back. This video is at the roots of ChefSteps.
I'm so happy you guys are back
Its refreshing that ChefSteps videos are not commercials for their sous vide Joule anymore.  Welcome back
nice to see riley is still with you guys
ChefSteps, this is too much, first, you have come back and now you go as far as improving the quality of your videos even more? Too amazing!
Whether they make traditional or sous vide videos, Chefsteps is always knocking it out of the park. Surprised people are still finding ways to throw jabs at Joule/sous vide lol.
I'm mexican and my grandma approves this. Ahuevo!! 😘😘
Chefsteps is delivering content again...... for however so long this lasts, I'm happy.

Thank you chefsteps, these things bring me joy.
Short. Sweet. On point!
Thank you for being the best thing in my life chefsteps!
I'm so glad you guys are making videos again! Christmas came early
Love the recipe
Thanks for sharing
Riley!!
This is the content that I loved about this channel! Welcome back, Chefsteps!
Is that Riley?
3 videos in a week?! Christmas came early.
By the way, could you guys do a recipe about shrimp chips/crackers?
3 videos in a week??? You guys are on fire! I’m so excited! Two new rationals? Wow!
Yes! Welcome back.
Im mexican and I my mouth waaaatereeed creaming lard with the masa geniussss thinking about adding some spices to it too. Yummm
Merry Christmas🎄🌛🌴🌵🐸
YESSSSS!!!! Are you gonna start uploading again?
So glad to have you back with these quality videos!!!
I thought you guys were dead or something.... So glad you are back making new content!!!!!!
Like before watching video.
I NEEDED YOU GUYSSS!!!! :)
Hold the phone, do I know those arms... IS OUR BOY BACK
Yeees ! We need more videos like this chefsteps 👍🏻
seriously, something deep down inside was missing but i think i found it again. welcome back!
Keep up,the good work
Yes they're finally back
>invite friends

Unrealistic recipe standards
Saliva covering my phone
That almost buttercream method for the masa dough is brilliant, looks so fluffy
Lard, yes, good. If you're going to put the effort into making tamales you might as well do it the old school (i.e. correct) way.
Ngalam iki Tamales barang haha
This is the ChefSteps I remember subscribing to years ago. Glad to see you guys have returned.
god this is a gorgeous video
I bet they are gearing up to pull another joule switcheroo and push some gadget or something
So glad to see you all back!
ChefSteps yadda yadda-ed the best part! What are those sauces and how were they made?
welcome back.....chefstep....
Are all these new videos early Christmas presents for us?? Glad ChefSteps is back!
Glad you guys are back! Though I miss the more detailed videos, you learn so much more through them.
Oh man. I followed you earlier on and I loved the videos and the company/ idea behind it. Although i don't know if it is financially viable, I would love to do exactly that as a job. Inventing recipes for resaturants and cooking experimentally. Well.. probably for another life, where it works out better.. haha
i literally had a tamale yesterday for the first time. thank u for this
awwww yeaHHHHHHHHHHH
Oh I thought this channel was dead. Neat video though.
Thats no mames! As good as pinche Rick bailey's cabrones.
fuoookk yeaassss
nice videography as usual
They're back!!!
Now it's seem they are back 😍😍😍😍😍
YALL ARE BACK
More video like this
After a year of inactivity
about friken timeeeeeee
What was the sauce that was poured over near the end?!
Love your videos, don’t stop 🤗
Please link me the private link to the gaben video
I would have liked a longer video going through the whole process, but nice to see the channel active again
I thought you guys were dead. Welcome back!
Chefsteps is back!
Mmmm lard, I just started using it recently, so good.
This looks awesome!!
🙏
hungy >:O
Lard Manteca really
What would you use if you do not have corn husks? I live in Canada and corn won't be available fro at least 5 months.
Should tamales be a little dry or a little more moist? Every time I've had them, they are always different. I've never had a consistent tamale experience.
Woooo
Selamat
Very appealing video and recipe! That stated, your title led me to imagine that, in place of corn husks or banana leaves, you were going to wrap the masa dough and fillings in glove boned pig trotters. I was very excited. Please do that next.
yes!!! more videos!
That looks awesome!!!
Yum!
Spoiling us chef steps!!!!
Ohh... They back
They cook well in a pressure cooker if you have one big enough. And it only takes 15 minutes.
Happy ur back
Never ending inspiration.
Chef steps: "Crap, we ran out of the Joule money.... I guess we could start doing YouTube video again"
Another new videos from chefsteps? Is Christmas coming early this year?😍
The editing is so much better and more satisfying than Gordon Ramsay's videos
Butter instead of lard, will it work?
OMG, you guys finally BACKKK!!!!!!
Beautiful
is Hans still on the 1s and 2s?  Feels good!
Soooooo when do I sous vide the tamales?
Chefsteps..👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤❤❤
Sexy ❤️❤️
Notification squad!!!!!
That seems like a lot of lard...
I love the sauce... What did you use? I usually use  enchilada sauce... Yummmmeee
I know it's too soon to ask for a sousvide video because trolls are just waiting to pounce on it, but I miss a good sousvide recipie
No Joule? Such a disappointment, lads.
Can I sous vide the tamales?
When do I sous vide the xathum gum for the tamale?
title made me think of tamales made of horse meat... not that it would be bad, just yelling into the void <3
That masa needs s a bit of chili sauce mixed in so it’s not bland.
Welcome back Chefsteps!!!! Miss you guys so bad!!!
Whoa...are you guys finally back on YouTube?
Thank God ChefSteps started uploading again, by the way, the first episode of Kitchen Think was great.
People: complains about their videos and product ads 
Chefsetps: disappears 
People: surprised pikachu meme
Chefsteps two videos in two weeks Super like!
How can I level up my Grandma's pot roast when she's already making it at max level?
Grant!! You make this fun man. Great inspiration
My box of ramen from Osaka arrived, I find a beer at the bottom of the fridge so cold its nearly iced up, and a clip from chefsteps about my favourite slow cook beef style turns up.

Today is a good day.
Who the hell necromanced this channel?
I'm so happy that you guys are back on YouTube. I have been complaining in your Facebook comment section for a while now haha.
Good to see you guys back, amazing stuff
A welcomed return to form and YT - keep it up CS
I really missed Grant's butt. Is the best chunk of meet of the video
🤤
ChefSteps took time off to shake off the "i HaTe SoUs ViDe" weevils that were somehow subsribed to them. Good on y'all!
omg i missed grant so much 😭 

p.s. love his new look. what a daddy.
Grant so glad your back man. Show us stuff with the new sauces! Cheers!
Grant you're lookin YOKED bro!!
Amazing just Amazing... what a joy to watch!! Thanks for each Single Moment!!
OMG Welcome Back! Miss you!
Thank goodness your back! Buuuuut I bought a used Joule and it didn’t work just last week 😩  I returned it to Amazon thankfully.
XD thank you lord Gabin 
Happy to see Chefsteps in back in YouTube businesses
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!?! Good to see you back.
I MISSED YOU OMG WELCOME BACK!!!!
I KNEW IT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND HE LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE SO FAMILIAR AND NOW I CAUGHT IT.


FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, THIS KS KEANU REEVES CHEF VERSION
How dare you guys leave my life and Waltz back into here 😭
Glad you guys are back at it! Thanks for making it fun Grant!
LOOKING GOOD GRANT AND CHEF STEPS! SO GLAD TO SEE YOU BACK!
I've missed your frequent YouTube videos that used to be a regular viewing pleasure. 
It's fantastic to see ChefSteps back!
I saw you on Tasty and I just had to find your channel. Found it! Subscribed! Keep it up. :D
I thought Hidden Valley Ranch was in California, not the mid-west.
Nice haircut! Lookin' damn fine.
Omg an upload from Chefsteps! It's Xmas already!
Grant, in top form, as always!
Thank you so much for bringing this style of video back!!!!
WELCOME BACK 😋😋
Welcome back. 
What’s the name of that pressure cooker?
It’s been awhile. Grant I missed you😍
Dude who knew that john wick could cook 😲😲
Also when you'd guys return, I missed my food porn
Oh how i've missed Grant's post outro scenes
WHAT? is this for real?? I missed you so muchhhhh

Welcome back chef
Chefsteps, god I've missed you!!
Grantttt!!!  Guysss I missed you
I made this recipe twice. Once with searing the meat, and the other time without sharing the meat. I feel all the time when it was without searing, it had more flavor from the onion and the seasonings.
Grant is the BEST~
😍 That’s exactly the recipe my Grandma shared with me and using the stovetop pressure cooker. Has always been a favorite comfort food for our family. More pressure cooker (NOT instant pot) recipes, pretty please?
I like how you garnish with the celery, looks great and I'm sure that crunch is delicious!
Thank the lord, you're back! Just don't run off again for another year and keep us in suspense...
I think he was growing his hair and come back lately 🤔
really missed your videos, very happy to see new content
Brilliant! Glad to have you back
No Joule! Our prayers have been heard :D Welcome back Grant! Is Riley in there somewhere as well?
Chefsteps is back and grant looking more like Keanu Reeves
Welcome back guys! 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Grant's looking like Chris Evans with that beard!
Thank you for returning ChefSteps
I've missed these videos.  Welcome back!
no salt ?, or maybe the glaze covers that ?
I'm so excited to see ChefSteps uploading again
Chris Young at the end!  We need to see so much more of this guy, he has a lot of knowledge to share.
I love this video and I'm freaking vegan lol. It's been so long, nice to see you back grant as well as the chefsteps family.
Glad to have you back, guys. This video was lovely, it's such an approachable recipe. Thanks!
Chef steps level up > Ciara level up
OMG so happy to see Nick <3
WELCOME BACK!!
Upload more videos plz!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm so glad you guys are back!! Best culinary channel ever!
We've really been missing you all. Thanks for a new VID!!!
Thank you, Robert de niro and keanu reeves son
WELCOME BACK!!! MISSED YOU!!!
Ok I need that pressure cooker... where do I get those wonderful toys
Beard is awesome, Grant!
Definitely a return to form 👍
welcome back making content :-)
Yum. Will you please put up a thin, crisp cookie recipe, preferably a vanilla cookie, but chocolate chip or peanut butter would be great. Thank you for your great recipes.
See y'all in 20 years for the next upload
I'VE MISSED YOU <3333333
AHHHHHHHHH GRANT WE MISSED YOU
This felt kinda product placements to me? Anyone else?
Woohoo Grant and the gang are back! Inspire me gentlemen!
Great recipe! I was half expecting that pressure cooker to be a chef steps branded product for sale on their website... Too bad it isn't.
Omg favourite channel is back
Thank god you are back! Missed you guys.
Keanu Reeves can double for Grant
Please start uploading regularly again. We miss your videos
My Dutch oven would never forgive me if I made pot roast in a pressure cooker.
Now that looks absolutely divine!
Hey, what is that mini Gyuto/petty knife Grant is using?
SO HAPPY you’re making videos again! This is great. More please!
There are so many product placements, but at least ChefSteps is back.
Why do some people stick out their tongue and "bathe the food in their tongue before putting it in their mouth? Are they missing taste buds maybe and it's a subconscious thing? I'm talking about people that eat like cats.
Whoa!!!!......when did Grant grow a beard
Welcome to the land of the living, guys!
hi grant, missed you.
Welcome back!!!!
Those credentials tho @ 0:29
Any way to adapt it for the Instant Pot? Glad you guys are back at it!
Though I didn't mind the Joule videos in the past unlike past commenters, glad you're back!
EU ESTAVA COM SAUDADE ( I WAS MISSING YOU )
Chuck had my ideal “beefy” flavor. Amazing underrated cut of beef! Chuck burgers are on another level too!
No sous vide? Is this a miracle?
OH MY GOD I MISSED YOU GUYS SO MUCH
when i received a notification that Chefsteps has a new video i immediately opened the link. we miss you folks where have you been hiding under the rocks??
And ya'll thought that Grant was dead! Welcome back, Grant!
How is it not hella salty?
How can I make Ice with my Joule?
Am I the only one that feels like homie got a bit of a glowup. #daddy
YAAAAAASS!!! Welcome back Chefsteps!!  💖💖💖
I MISSED YOUR VIDEOS!!!!!
It has been a while, but great vid!
Just came to see if Joule would be used.
welcome back! miss you guys so much!
Damn, Chefsteps is back!!!
Damn, Grant has aged well.
so no joule?
Were u guys testing temps for your sous vide sauces feature? Causing for a momentary absence from YT?
THEYRE ALIVE!!
Ur baaaack!!! So glad chefsteps didn’t go to the corner store to buy cigarettes and never came home. 😍😍😍😍
Welcome back GUYs! Welcome back! What's with the long absence?
WHERE IS THE JOULE?!?! I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE THIS WITHOUT A JOULE! Or is the joke on me and you guys only sell pressure cookers now...?
So glad you're back!!!
You’re back!! Why this long break?
Like Carne de Panela (aka Brazil)
The Keanu Reeves look is a lot better than the mustache I must say
Going for that Keanu Reeves look?
I'd love to know more about that particular pressure cooker.
Grant grew a beard?!
Yessss. Welcome back team
looks fantastic...if we weren't in the middle of summer here in australia i'd be making this right now!!!
i came to level up granny's pot game and i'm not disappointed though
Im in serious want of that pressure saucepan... Details would be much appreciated
Why does he look like John Wick?. Somewhat
Man I love that you guys are back 👍
We realy missed you!!
i miss you so much dude
What company sells this pressure cooker?
Anyone know what kind of pressure cooker they use in this video?
My grandma would be so pissed if I started adding sh**... looks good though guys!!!
Please be live on Facebook again
Where can I get that pressure cooker?? Name please!!!!!
Made my day!  Welcome back!
Grant!!!!!
I've missed you guys so much!
Keanu Reeves, is that you?
I thought you are dead guys but now i know. You were just resting before big comeback. I love you.
They're back!!
OMG GRANT IS BACK YESSSS
Amazing to have you back !
Yes!!! Welcome back!!!!!!
Finally your making vids again! Lol
Welcome back. It's been awhile.
Grant!  No Joule on this cook?
16 grandmas dislike this 😂
Guys make more videos please 😩🙏🙏🙏 we love it
who are you? (just kidding)
Grant look more manly than before
I miss u so much!
lmao...   the first minute totally describes my Grandma. Trying to talk about culinary approach is like asking her about Bluetooth compatibility.
Keep making videos please!!!!
Yay you're back!!
Grants BACK!! Dude, not saying the other personalities on this channel are bad, by any means, I’m just saying yours is the best lol glad to see you back on mate
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO YAAS
Love you guys! Any idea how long this would take in an electric pressure cooker on high pressure? Thanks~
My man!
Awesome as always Grant.
What is the chef accent if i may ask? her remind me of Miranda Sings when he says "Amazing"..👀
Alright, my mom always used French onion soup mix instead of ranch... but I’m open to trying new things.
The celery is raw though 🙄
Enfin de nouvelles vidéos c’est trop bien!!!
Welcome back 👍
Whaaat? Grant has a beard now?
It’s cool, I’m just gonna miss that ‘stache.
They're back!!!
Damn with the beard and the long hair, he almost look like captain american in Infinity War lol
Incidentally, ever wondered why you can't replicate KFC chicken at home with any degree of accuracy?  It's because they use this pressure cooker trick to achieve their flavor.
are you planning to sell something new?
stove top P.C. .......new one.
Yeah ChefSteps is back :D
Me seeing this: Ugh, if he tells me to sous vide it, I'm unsubscribing.
Me seeing "ranch and A1" as flavorings: oh f**k this is my kind of recipe!!
y'all are alive?!
where could one find that pressure cooker?
Capitan America is making recepies. Its my birthday or something?..
Looks amazing!
omg, after almost two years Grant's voice came back
I missed you guys
I missed you guys
If caramelizing the meat surface to get flavor is important - why have 1 big piece of meat rather than cutting it up into more pieces?
Holy crap Grant Crilly is back?!!!! I unfollowed after this channel died. Also.... no sous vide?!??? Whaaaa
Back from the wilderness with a beard and a giant peace of meat!
❤
Super tasty looking recipe. Props for separating your veggies out to maintain texture--I do something similar by roasting my "eating" veg separate from my "stewing" veg. I've been looking for an excuse to pressure cook, and this looks like a fine recipe...although, I wonder how some mushrooms would do tossed in to increase the savory...
OMG! Missed these videos.
Can you replace the beef with pork
Grandma has left the chat.
We missed you
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN.
Way too much celery, and a lot of people don't like the stringy texture of celery, especially when it's chunky and semi-raw like that.
FINALLY MY FAV CHANNEL IS BACK
CHEFSTEEEEEEPS! YEAH BOII!
I missed you guys!
So happy you are back!!!!!!
Trying to sell a new product?
Chef steps are back.. thank god.
since when john wick did a cooking channel?
its been too long chefsteps
This channel is not DEAD!!!
I missed this guy so much...
Yes, guys are back!!!!!
Where can I get this pressure cooker?
those product placements tho...
Yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh more vids more vids pls
FINALLY!
You don't roast grandma's pot, you smoke it.
you think you can disappear for a year and win our love back with pot roast ?! Well......you're right.
When do I get to use my Joule?
I miss u guys :(
Awesome. Finally!
What kind of pressure cooker is that?
Holy crap it’s Grant
Anyone know what he meant exactly with the canned tomato favor?
I’m so happy right now
you guys are finally back!!!
It’s a Christmas miracle!!
Welcome back !
1. The rationals are back! Two small instead of the big one. Yay!

2. No mention of joule! Whew!

3. A technique with something besides the joule! (See 2.) yay!!

4. You guys are back! Call it season 2. Yay!

Now will you explore autolyzing? 

Love you guys!
Nice helmet grant
GRANT

RIP hipster 'stache
omfg yall alive??

KEEP ON DOING THIS PLEASE ILL DO ANYTHING
HOOOOOMAIIIIIGAWWWDDDDDDDD YAAAAALLLLLBACC
Ronald MacDonald
Made it tonight. Solid recipe. 3 things, all on my side. 1, Wish I had had more time to reduce the stock. Started later than I had wanted though.  2, I went with the 8 min pressure to cook the veg but 5 would have been plenty. 3, I'm not crazy about the ranch flavor profile. That's me though, the fam liked it.
Welcome home
I wonder if the few folks whining about the msg eat Doritos.
remember joule?
My momma makes a great pot roast tho....
Who makes that pressure cooker
Thought u r dead
Looks YUM!  What happened to those other tuff cuts?
Good to see you guys again!
Can you add bone marrow in the pressure cooker method or is there not an optimal time to put it in?
Wow finally a new video!
You’re back!
We’ve missed you guys!!!!
Oh my gurd
So, we're just going to ignore you abandoning me, Dad?
Link to the pressure cooker por favor?
On an instant pot would that be 2 hours on high?
What model pressure cooker is that
love to see you guys back
John Wick tryna cook
no joule?
Rad
ChefSteps. Bigger...Better.....Bearder
Youre alive!
Errrh mi gawrd! ;)
What kind of pressure cooker pot is that, can you link?
What is the accent where instead of saying “braising” they say “braiseeeen”?
hey you guys are back where did you go its been a while
Wooow slloowwmaaaan
try sous vide pot roast
what pressurecooker are you guys using, i just like the how it looks
So what if you don’t like that crunch of the celery but like the taste of it cooked, how would you prep it?
Come here to like. Miss you guys so much
Please dont stop making videos, all of you are realy making the diference and helping my gastronomy and of my friends
I’m so happy!!!!! New vid!!!!
Looking very good & delicious
Terrific recipe! I have at least half of those ingredients at my house already! And like the rest of America I have an instant pot pressure cooker! There’s Sunday dinner. Thanks you guys!
Nice :) seems like you'd lose alot of broth by reducing it separately though, why not just do it in the pressure pot?
made pot roast yesterday, no ranch or a1 tho, might try that next time ; i used home-made stock/broth + wine + garlic + rosemary tho ; turned out pretty good, but im definitely going to try adding the veggies in at later stages like this =] ; glad to have u guys back doing what everyone originally luv'd about this channel =] merry winter solstices!
Was that a Chris appearance? Haven't seen Chris on here in a looong time.
why u back???
What happened to the other meat?
I couldn’t care less about the meat in the pot, I want the meat in the apron!
I thaught you were died
No, no, no. Barely cooked veggies and uncooked celery.  Gross!  Nice idea to add the Ranch seasoning and A1.
Yummy 😋
When do you add salt to the dish?
FIRST! OMG HI MOM!
Unsubbed after the whole joule fiasco. I was curious about the channel and was surprised there was new content again, decided to sub again and hope for more content like this (just also hope not all the videos are short product ads)
What type of pressure cooker did you use in this video. It's kinda short
1st
It looks heathy too.. thumbs up if you agree..
You AND Glove and boots are back? What is this, 2015 again?
zero character on those potatoes and carrots and that celery is not "done", and you call that leveling up??
Glad to see a CS video! But yikes that camera work is not great and the 10 different background tracks...
I thought you guys died...
you want firm potatoes? why ....
2 bars? Isn't that close to 30 psi? It's my understanding that most pressure cookers operate at a max of about 15psi. Or is that a special pressure cooker? How would cooking time change with a max 15psi (~1 bar) pressure cooker?
Great Great Great 💯😃😃😃😃
,,basicly just spices and MSG..."    ????? wtf  ?
Why is he so hot? Whhyyyyy?
Grant + No outside chefs + bonus shot of Nick?
Wish I could like this twice.
Food bae, marry me... so handsome, so talented in the kitchen
My granny never even knew how to make a pot roast. She was a horrible cook, LOOOOOOOL! xD
2 bars for 2 hours huh? You owe me a chuck roast, ranch packet, onion, and a bottle of A1sauce!
My boy grants arms looking bigger than 3 years ago that’s for sure. Why you guys abandon us?
Can you make a chicken pot roast recipe? My grandparents always do it but it's not very good.
Glad to see you still have the original hosts. I thought you’ve might’ve replaced them since the last video didn’t showcase anyone.  It’s always crap to see a channel vanish for awhile just to come back with a new host without rhyme or reason.
Lol sponsered by A1, Swanson, and Hidden Valley! XD
So glad to see you guys back again.  I use the almost exact same process for galbi jjim.  5cm thick short rib sections braised in a sweetened soy infused broth with grated asian pear or apple.  I get really annoyed when the potatoes, carrots, and daikon are overcooked so I put them in about halfway in the cook time when the galbi is cooked but not tender..  I have tried some that used dried fruit (whole and once in a "mash") and less sugar.  Yeah, Korean grandmas have their own version of pot roast.
Lost me at MSG
It was all looking good until you ruined it with MSG.
About time we get a new video!!!!! Hell yea
JFC, they went from pimping out their sous vide gadget to pimping out Clorox and Kraft.
Updated joule never worked again.  Thanks
Takes everything away from a pot roast and makes it something artifical with ingredients such as “ranch powder”.
Keanu Reeves?
Everything about the title of this video is wrong.
So do I just throw my Joule in the pressure cooker too? Or...
2:00 canned tomatoes tastes better with tons of preservatives.
Damn brother right when my cooking channel finally started to fill the chefsteps void 😤😤😤
Also work of camera is different. I think this is some sort of plan b videos after few bad buisness moves
That does... Not look good. Way too much parsley at the end, the flavors seem wrong, and hidden valley?? No way.
using msg --> FAIL!
No joule, no pornstache. Seems we’re improving.
This comes off more like beef stew more than an elevated pot roast. You want to change the game try adding in some red wine, herbs, and Worcestershire sauce. This takes it more to a beef bourguignon dish but, even if you leave out the wine it will be really good.
Pot roast has never sucked. How dare you.
Yeah, no sous vide. I like it.
Looks great but I think adding veggie along with the meat was meant to transfer those veggie favour into meat, and at the same time potato will absorb the favour of the meat back. and instead of  pressure it 2 times I think it's more convenient to throw everything in the first place as I heard that pressure pot won't destroy the shape of potato.
Contract with Joule must be up! Never been happier! Keep the CHEFsteps, not the bag and forget method!
Yea. How about cut that meat up into four cubes. Brown all sides of all cubes.  Add in a splash of fish sauce INSTEAD of ranch powder.  Christ it’s like you aren’t even trying.
I don't usually click Dislike on a video. Your food looks great. I think you wasted my time though. I went to look at the recipe to see if you had an oven option since I don't own a pressure cooker. This was a logical thought since most of your audience won't have a pressure cooker. You can't see the recipe unless you spend $49 on your website. Good grief. I'd be happy to switch that to a Like if you can help me out.
Joule: "Am I a joke to you?"
Damn a video not promting Joule! How this has been missed <3  Time to push ChefSteps to over 1 million subs?
Thank god he lost the pedostache.
I feel betrayed, I have been waiting for an upload for a long time. I don't think I can like this video....I'm so conflicted
You lost me at msg and store bought broth
Betting it has something to do with Joule
sous vide?
Where's the joule version of this recipe??????????
I missed u guys so much
What you think you can just waltz back into my life....ooooo naan bread
A new Chefsteps video?
A new chefsteps video that isn't about the Joule??
A new Chefsteps video that doesn't have any sous vide???

Could it be? Are you back?

Edit: I had a feeling this was for the Joule Ready... Still, this is new content. ☺
Oh snap I thought you guys were dead.
Are ChefSteps back on YouTube finally!?
I thought the sous vide went up in flames and killed you all
Damnnn electricity must have turned back on the office.
Welcome back! What a great choice of recipe, too. Thanks for your videos!
woah, long time no see
THEY ARE BACK. THIS IS NOT A TEST. THEY ARE BACK
This was a very pleasant surprise for a Wednesday. Hoping we'll see more content!
Dang the production quality is on point
Is this channel still alive!?!?!? Good to have you back!! (and not be an infomercial to joules anymore)
OMG!! I can't believe it, a new ChefSteps video, so amazing! THX!
Wer u all been? Miss your videos and grant talking about food
It’s great to see your channel putting out videos! I hope to see more in the future!
love the style of this video - quick but not rushed - lots of movement which is a nice change from the older stuff. and those speed ramps are slick! 

also, riley...?!
Beautiful cinematography, beautiful recipe. Welcome back.
Yall really stepped up the editing here and the angles I love it
Looks like a whole pile of new Indian recipes coming our way!

I'm glad that you guys are back.
What was that in the end? Burrito? 
That's the wrong way of serving Naan!
Is that Riley "Rye Dog" "Rye Bread" Moffitt, back after two years?
This is awesome! Just when I needed a recipe for flat bread!
FINALLY. AMAZING VIDEO PLEASE KEEP IT COMING!!!!
Whoohoo you're back. How I've missed those crazy good tunes with the recipes.

I can't even begin to imagine how much production time this took. Stunning work.
Missed you guys so much glad to see you back! Keep them coming!
I'm so happy you made a new video! Keep em up! And I can't wait to make this!
This is the ChefSteps I know and love :')
YOURE BACK! pls stay?
TItle isn't "No Naan-sense" 0/10
Thank You! - your videos have been very much missed!
Finally a new video....I was losing faith in chefsteps 
Did lord Gabin remind you to post a video?
Welcome back!! Sooo glad to hear from you guys!!
I never thought this day would have come. Chef Steps is back!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?! MOAR VIDEOS!
Welcome back, you were missed greatly
one of my fav channel is back on track :D
so happy that chefsteps is finally back!! especially with a video that is not just about joule!
thank god you're still alive!! <3
Glad to have you all back again. Nice production quality as always...
So I must have missed it... what temperature do I set Joule to?  ;)
Oh God! Glad to see this channel back on line 😆
Production quality🔥
You’re back?! Wow! On a side note, I bought a Joule and had to return it after first use. This was literally two days ago. 😔 Sad. It was used, but still.
Welcome back! I missed you guys.
Clean videography man! Love it
Everything else aside, I love your content. I consider this channel to be one of the gold standards of cooking videos on YouTube, and I can't wait for more from you guys!
Boys are back and I'm lovin it
Thank goodness they are back. Their video quality has gotten so good
Not being an ass here, but I want more than just a Tasty style video.  Where are Grant and crew?   They made really good instructional videos with personality and enthusiasm.
No Naansense? ugh I know, I'll see myself out.
I missed you 🖤🧡💛💚💙❤🖤
Dear Chef Steps, We've all missed your videos!!! Please keep them coming!! Please do a Lamb Shank Video
Suprised the people who complain about sous vide haven't already unsubscribed. The option is there guys LOL 🤣
Back after a year and no Joule? Woo
YAY!  I was just checking your channel the other day for new videos! Welcome back?!  Great video too
Tandoor i guess was missing chef
So glad you guys back...😊
OMG YER BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
Na Na Na naan... hey hey hey.. goodbyeee
Welcom back ❤
ChefStep[ping] back onto my feed with a quality video! Peas to see you! I'll show myself out.
After 1 year back in business ?? Yeahhhh !!
wellcome back guys.. Let's roll !!!!
We are waiting more videos <3
i love your video content, please continue to make more
Please heed less attention to the bigots who hate all sous vide content and keep producing videos on YouTube.  Your content has very high production value and your chefs/hosts are knowledgeable and charismatic.  Even the more technically involved recipes that required a centrifuge or chamber sealer are still so entertaining to watch.  There is so little modernist cuisine oriented content online to consume and it makes your channel very unique.
Welcome back the background music gives hype, hope we can see more videos quit often
amazing new recipe! cant wait to try it, but how do I warm up the yogurt?
omg they're back. FINALLY THE VOID IS FILLED. Really like the updated aesthetic. Missed that quality music
Holy Moly Batman, I almost fell off my chair, it's a ChefStep actual food video😂😂😂
Lol, your supposed to sous vide the flour
You guys have to start crediting your sounds on your videos. I love the music.
Chefsteps reinvented? Loooking forward for more!!!!
Keep Producing Guys Missed your content
Old school format!!! Just bring the chill music back 😁
Welcome back guys. To anyone who nags about Joule, I simply want to point out that you are watching a group of people practising Modernist Cousine. If you don't like their precise measures, food additives, and temperature controlled cooking, you can easily swipe down and watch your favorite "Tasty fried chicken". But don't bring them down to your ordinary world with you. Let them create more visionary dishes.
chefstep finally update something 😱
WELCOME BACK OMG??
FINALLY COOKING!!
So happy too see that you are back. Such great quality on both the show and the food, hope you are here too stay!
Thought its Sous Vide Naan...

Oh my god, What a relief...
Welcome back !!! Is that Nick?? Show your face Nick !!
Yeeeehaaa, chef steps are back in Business =D
I knew keeping this subscription was going to pay off
I'm a simple man. I see ChefSteps I click like.
Wait?! At what point do I use the Joule? Im confused?! WHERE IS THE JOULE!
one thousand years laterr~~ welcome back!!
Omg I've missed you guys so much!
Welcome back! Don't forget to work in all the pretty boys.  You still have the pretty boys right?
I miss this content. This is why I subscribed.
Welcome back! Really enjoy the new dynamic style
WOW! Happiness is to find a new chefsteps video after... I don't know, months, years?
Finally you guys are uploading again, I am so happy!
About time you guys started putting videos up again. I miss Grant, the science, the explanations and the exposure to modern cooking techniques. I hope things only go up from here!
Welcome back!!! I haven’t been so happy to see anyone post stuff again. Obviously Grant has “other fish to fry” these days but I’d love to see more presenting as well as these types of videos. Stoked you’re back
Nani!!!?
THEY R BACK!! <3 <3
Yooo! I just got my Joule yesterday!

What's the ROI on a video like this?
I thought I'd never see the day of another Chef Steps video
You'll make a naan-believer out of me yet.
Finally a recipe with basic ingredients
JouleReady sauces? I remember back in the day when ChefSteps would show me how they made the sauce not just sell it to me in a bag.
New Chefsteps???
Finally!!! After one year you guys are back.
This is obscene!!! Love it.
They're baaaaaack!!!!!
Finally ! you are back
would be cool if you guess actually taught us how to be professional chefs. Its something I liked about chefsteps that is unique. you use professional techniques. I want you guys to make it more professional not more amateur oriented.
... and so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me...
I thought lord Gaben ended this channel. Glad to see it still alive.

The fact that you didn't name this video "No-Naansense Naan" is a disgrace to pun enthusiasts everywhere.
But can you cook it in a Joule?
How awesome to have you back!!
It's been 84 years....
back from the dead
You guys are alive!!! Yes!
Welcome back
This is the nonsense naan. . . (I like ya'lls other videos). PS: traditional naan= nothing on top, just the bread out of a tandoor does all the talking, and for God sake you never put rice in a naan . . .
where the hell have you been all this time
Where y'all been?
Welcome back
finally indian food. More please.
Welcome back
They’re ALIVE!!!!!
Oh you guys better be back!
Dang i miss you guys.
Woot???? Yey!!!! A video!!!!!!!!!
Is that fresh tumeric being grated on the naan?  

I've never seen this but one of the local Pan Asian markets has a few different varieties of fresh tumeric.  I have never had a need or use for it.
indubitably
I figured it was jail time
Its been 85 years
i miss you guyssssssssss so muchhhhh!!!! welcome backkkk
You are back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Happy to see You guys :)
They missed the opportunity to say naansense there
I missed y’all
i miss grant
Well hello, welcome back
No talking, straight and to the point.  Like it.
You’re back!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hello old friend 😌😊
Wow , Finally 👍
Omg bout time you guys make a video!!! It’s been over a year

wow i miss you guys, and i didnt even know it til i saw this video. cant wait to see more. please do more.
They be back???? Pog
Mouth is watering
YOU'RE BACK!!!! YAAAAAAAY
Yay!
I thought you guys lost the password
This is not naan. Naan doesn’t use oil.
I hope this video will inspire many other food channels. Very nice video..
Wait which part of this do I sous vide?
I was going to say I missed you but this video is annoying.  The video barely helps, I need to go to a website in the link, music is...meh but annoying.  

WTF guys?  There is a lot of production value here, very slick.  But I HATE watching it.  Seriously.  The whole thing is annoying.  Mainly because it is flashy but doesn't do what it is supposed to do which is help us make whatever the hell it is you are making.

Fire your super-hip video editor who edited this to within an inch of its life and get someone who gets that people watching a cooking video want a cooking video and not some pretentious crap aimed to be in the Guggenheim.
What took you so long, posting content again? Nice to see you back in action
Naansense bruh
Welcome back
So, you've got a new video guy?
Where is Grant?
Hey!
omg she’s not dead
I love Chefsteps
THEY'RE BACK
hey ur back!
Oh hell no. You guys are back! You better have at least one video a week.. or else.
You're back!
Now how can I integrate my Joule into this?
This is sexy AF missed you guys
Where have y’all been??
Nice orange theme
New ChefSteps!!!!!!
Omg a new video
Merci
They are back !
Watch with the sound turned off and save yourself from tinnitus.
Yall are back?!
How do you clean the oil off the wood work area?
or you could just buy some
Omg yesssssssss
And where the hell have you been son?
This will work for pita too. :)
OhmygodYOUAREBACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow! a new video i thought u guys retired!
Why did chef steps take a year off?
Money on your overpriced Joule running out?   Time to get back to making videos?  Here's a tip: the food didn't make your videos great, it was the personalities.
I almost panicked thinking I'd missed the sous vide step, but then I remembered I could use Joule to make the yogurt. ...I'm just kidding ya, I'm glad to see new ChefSteps and this naan recipe looks great, much simpler than other recommended home recipes. I made paratha and roti recently, but naan which I like even more I've avoided because the recipes I've found for indoor home use (without a tandoor) were extremely complex for a flatbread and I figured not worth the effort But this ChefSteps recipe may finally get me to make naan to serve with my curries! Thanks, ChefSteps!
This is called a Kulchaa Fam, not a Naan. An Indian 🍞 yes but a different kind, see we 1.3 billion brown folks could in our totality manage to conjure up more than 1 variety of bread east O'er here in India. Surprising isn't it. #IKidYouNot
Welcome baack!
Hello old chefsteps
Finally a new video
This looks so ridiculously awesome!
Oh my God you back people!
Old school
Yum
Can the dough be made in advanced?
Wooowww! I don't believe it... You still live!
I wrapped my naan around a joule and placed it on the grill, now my house smells like burnt bread and melted plastic. Can I somehow get rid of the stink using the fifteen new joules you keep shilling me with?
Where did u guys went???
I’m so ready for you guys to be back
Please don't make this an annual thing! How about weekly? Ok, bi-weekly then? The youtube channel is why I paid for ChefSteps premium, knowing Joule would not ship to my country. Youtube is available in about 185 countries more than Joule is shipping to, must be an enticing market, right? Next on your roadmap, more fresh content/courses on the premium site? Anyway: Thank you for being alive still...
Please don't be the first and the last new video you guys make. We get it, you make a sound vide cooker
Nice
I thought you guys are dead.
i want sous vide video :(
So glad you’re back, but so much advancement has happened in bread since the ideas in this video. Where are the modernist elements? Did you pre-gelatinize any of the flour? Use a home made starter? Go no-knead? India has made naan without kitchen aid for thousands of years, meanwhile. That sauce blurb was a little bit of nonsense.
Keep going with this type of video. Then get back to molecular gastronomy at least once a month. If you do that, consistently, we might put up with the occasional joule advert.

But if the next video is joule, I’m unsubscribing.
Please tell me this comes out chewy rather than cake-y!  It looks right.  I guess I'll just have to give this recipe a try.  You know, unleavened flatbreads cooked in the same way will puff just as well, if not better.  The first pita bread recipe I ever tried was completely unleavened and we still love it.  It's "sturdier" than the leavened version, but that can be a good thing when stuffing a pocket.  ;)
That’s not a good naan.
What’s up with the gap of one year
Come visit, I have very tasty and healthy. YOU WILL NOT REGRET)
Can I use my iPhone to do all the work tho? I am boring and uninspired.
Who made that music?
They are bacccccck
So, even naan is Jews now...
I thought you guys became so fat eating your own tasty looking food that you couldn't film another video anymore.
Back with indian food
1.This is indian (i guess)
2.Where is da real chef steps(grant)
3.Iz hez Dead? the real one?(grant)
and Joule is still not available in any but a handful a counties.. why do you hate money?
I know it's all about joule now and I understand that but couldn't you make just one last frenzy... just once or maybe a joule frenzy or whatever I just want to see advanced chefs mess around and get creative 
Consider replying please :)
Chefsteps is back?....

Maybe we'll have some more modernis......WTF is Joule Ready? 

$7.00 for prepackaged single use sauces? uhhhhh no thank you.
Remember when chefsteps used to have personality?
My god! New chef steps Video without joule? Is it Christmas already?
What's up with those absurd amounts of oil in the last few steps? Way too much oil for my taste.
This recipe is so inauthentic. You're mean to flip the naan and say " nana nana nana nana, nana nana nana nana, naan man". 

Otherwise Rakesh might call and threaten to use his pant snake on you.
You need baking powder instead of yeast. And you left out the kalonji seeds. Not a good naan recipe at all guys....
nonsense.. you can’t make good nan without the tandori oven.. and that’s a fact 😏☝️
Love the video but it’s missing naan cooked in a home tandoor oven! The texture and taste come out different than stovetop or in an oven. Visit www.tandoors.com to learn more.
Any chance we will see any of the molecular gastronomy videos of old?
This channel has imploded. It got jouled.
I joined Chefsteps for the amazing contents. I left because of the incessant Joule ads.
Not enough. We want ol'times chemical recipes.
No more pentinex or cool ascorbic acid recipes? I miss the olden days full of molecular gastronomy, now the whole channel feels like one gigantic sous vide product placement :(
Let me guess. Put it in a Joule and then finish in an oven for perfectly crispy skin???
"Lemme walk you through the process"

No thank you, we all know how it works now.
I'm looking at the comments here, and i really don't wanna join in on the hating, but unfortunately i have to agree. And its not just the youtube videos either.

The latest lot of actual recipes on the chefsteps website are over a month old now, and they're about hunting and cooking wild game, which frankly isn't applicable to me (and i suspect the vast majority of other readers). I get that they're trying to do something different, but at the same time, i have to wonder if that is really what their customers want. And yes, i do mean customers. I signed up for the chefsteps premium service, and at $39 its not like its hurt my finances or anything, but i do have to ask what that money has actually gotten me and whether it was worth it.

Updates have become tragically infrequent, often inapplicable to to what I (and i suspect many others) are trying to achieve in their kitchens, and unfortunately there does seem to be a lot of product placement for Joule (which isn't even available in my country. I ended up getting an Anova). I paid $39 cause i liked their earlier content, and i like these guys so i really wish i could recommend their premium service, but i just can't at this point. Not when other websites like SeriousEats are posting weekly, and have much more applicable content, for free...
Who miss Chefsteps?
Okay, you guys convinced me. I'm buying an Anova.
Oh cool! Maybe this is not just a Joule commercial.... GOD DAMN IT
The Joule has become self aware
This is basically the same recipe as you did a video on last year?
As a professional chef, ChefSteps recipes never applied to me, before or now; however the enchanting music and production value of the original videos were intoxicating and so satisfying. 

Joule is a great tool and sous vide is a fabulous and underrated method of cooking. I respect ChefSteps going in a more marketable direction. 

But I just of course miss the awesomely addicting videos of old, even if I will never utilize the recipes on this channel then or now.
Why not just call the channel JouleSteps.
Man come on guys, the bag wasn't even fully underwater.. That just seems like a undercooked disaster waiting to happen. When will you start caring about your video content again?
What happened to the channel? Ended? So sad! :(
Watch the Youtube channel called Sous Vide Everything. The guys uses and compares different products and foods .. cooks AMAZING food.
Back in the old chefsteps days, youtubers made sarcastic remarks like "let me just grab my home centrifuge." Now that chefsteps makes more accessible videos youtubers are sad the old videos are gone.
"Thanksgiving sauce." Boi did you really just call a hollandaise "Thanksgiving sauce?" 
What happened to actually teaching people about real cooking and not some glorified heat stick?
Literally no one could have guessed that this would be another desperate advertisement.  No one.
What happened to the videos with the CS crew full of personalities... Now it's just either joule ad or Facebook style video with no dialog...
MORE Joule vids? come on. Has this channel jumped the shark yet? Maybe that will be next. Sous vide shark.
Where have you guys gone to? I'm missing new Chefsteps content in my life :(
Whatever happened to ChefSteps, guys? I miss this channel.
I mean, they are a business, they always was. Go ask Sonny why they do nothing but adverts for their shite. 
That said, did he just leave that turkey to float overnight?
Joule is right there with the Nintendo Switch on my best tech list for 2017....
Aaaaaand unsub. 

Check out Every Day food with Sara Carey on the Martha Stewart channel or FoodWishes for ACTUAL CONTENT
it isnt even a recipe.  it is i cooked a turkey breast, watch me.
"this year we're gonna do something a bit different", proceeds to show the exact same recipe as last year. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.

Any chance you'll be getting back to the videos that brought us all here? Or is it just another year of Joule plugs?
This isn't even a recipe, it's an ad. This is what we get after 8 months?
Rocking it Tyler, the joule is awesome!
We miss you Chefsteps can't wait for new videos! =]
"we've done it all, we roasted turkeys, we smoked turkeys, but this year I think there's something that's even better"  I wonder what that could be.
YES! Joule is back! Can't get enough of that Joule
I was expecting him to vacuum seal a whole turkey -- I'm disappointed.
Did you dieded?
Seriously...are you going to shut this channel down?
I love how this channel went from being an awesome modern cooking show to basically nothing more then an infomercial for "Joule". I mean hey... Gotta go where the money is.
It's one thing to promote your product. It's another to completely neglect your subscribers.
Why are we not seeing more new video receipes and more often? Love ChefSteps!!!!
hey problem joules don't ship to australia so i can't get it =(
Omg the thumbnail made Tyler look like that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
Hey, Tyler Florence! Long time, no see. Nice.
Please come back, I can't take your absence any more.
Joule again?
I'm outta here ... bye!
Knew the foolproof technique was to sous-vide the turkey when I saw the amount of dislikes lol
You guys only produced 27 videos this year :( we miss you
Hey Tyler, the turkey is not fully submerged.
I bought the Anova instead of the Joule.... couldnt get it in my part of the world  : (
Ok, tried this today. While the flavor was excellent, the texture just wasn't turkey. It had the consistency of processed lunch meat. Will make great sandwiches though.
I loved this channel before it transformed into the Joule marketing campaign
I challenge you to make the BEST indonesian food "RENDANG". I hope you accept this challenge
Why is there no more videos??? Why are y'all not posting anything 😭😭
I wonder who he lifted this recipe from.
Eff you Florence. Stop using metal utensils in that non-stick pan!
There wasn't even enough water in the damn pot! YOU AMATEUR!
When's the next upload!!
Remember that time when @ChefSteps uploaded.
these people really killed the channel with these joule ads :/ they just dont care anymore and never uploaded anymore because people left after all those joule vids
Where's the original team? I miss watching them. The wall of fire is the best thing you've ever done. Please come back
i remember when this channel was actually good. Now i just don't want to buy a joule.
Deconstructed Turkey was way better. MooGloo and all.
hey guys, will you make Japanese miso Ramen noodles?
So where is the different versions of salt I can't pronounce?
Bring back our Chef Steps!
Also, fans still remember good old geoduck days
Low and slow on a turkey breast?  Why?  Didn't figure it had much connective tissue.
Joule is my favourite chef.
Would you or could you use joule for confit things?
Tyler Florence is kind of a tool.. ChefSteps: You guys are better than Tyler Florence!!
This channel had so much potential. Smh. Should be more like bon appetite. It's about people, and food. Yet you continue to try to push the sues vid as the new normal. 

It's an extra couple steps and it only improves traditional cooking methods by a little.
can you guys show any recipe without Joule.. ?
My god do I miss these videos like the fluffy proofed doughnuts or that awesome chocolate cake all the tips behind their ingredients that channel was truly unmatched .
Most hipster thanksgiving possible.
Chefsteps ... more like SousVideSteps !
Slow cooked food is always better
praise our lord and saivor Joule
More vids?
I miss new videos bro :(
Why are there no more videos now??
Afraid this will be lost in the sea of hate,  but I have a Joule and plan to use it to make turkey on Thanksgiving. How many people will this recipe feed?
Yea, ChefSteps jumped the shark when it turned from innovative educational content to an infomercial.
Where's Ben? 
Where's Nick?
Where has the centrifugal machine been?!

I really liked your cool intricate completely not-doable-for-the-typical-home-chef kind of videos. I feel like I can sous-vide with my eyes closed.
(Meat and seasoning in bag, under water at X temp for Y hours, followed by a sear on a hot cast iron pan)
People who use metal utensils in non-stick pans...smh
rip the chefstep boys, we'll never see their beautiful faces again
If I wanted Tyler Florence I wouldn’t be subscribed to ChefSteps! 😠
I miss this channel :(
If the meat isn't under water....gases can develop
This video really lacks the usual ChefSteps precision and charm; there was meat above the water line! Really boring with minimal instruction. I hope to see less of this and more of the old creativity and innovation.
Stop repeating the damn sous vide turkey and get us something new
I'm glad to see Tyler isn't dead. I haven't seen him in ages.
Grant wtf happened man
I don't mind the borderline Joule ads, but this one was just straight-up boring.
Where are the old kind of video recipes??? molecular gastronomy?? I'm likely going to unsubscribe soon...
It’s been too long!!
You guys need to take a step back and think on your older videos, more sciencey and innovative, not afraid to try new things. I don’t know if you have a patreon but that works too. Hate to see a great channel fall of from lack of inspiration.
Joule is awesome, but when he put his breast down they were exposed to air in the bag and they were floating, if you sous vide like that you are going to have a bad time. You don't want air in the bag.
Is this channel dead?
Are u dead? 😢
Yaaaaas! Tyler Florence!
My centrifuge is getting dusty.
Wtf happened to chef steps ?????
What do you recommend for gravy?
Ons of the firsts
Rip chef steps
Joule i buy that last year and i think anova is way more better.
I refuse to buy the Joule simply because this channel and the team behind it refuses to actually put real effort into showing us recipes and talking more about cooking and food.
are all the chefsteps are for the chefsteps sous vide, joule sous vide?
'what a disap!!!you used to bring it!!!   this vid sucks, im sorry for you get back to it already
Never put flavorings in when you sous vide.  It dilutes the flavors.
You guys have went downhill....
Request: hand-pulled noodles!
why you stop uploading?
Did you guys go broke, because I never see you guys post anymore
5 month no recipes what happened chefsteps ???
ANNDDDD Chefsteps is dead.
5 month no recipes what happened chefsteps ???
is this channel dead?
Got a souse vide machine. Didnt get Joule because the name is annoying after watching this channel.
wtf happened to this channel? *cry*
Are all ChefSteps videos advertisements for the Joule?
Don't have this fool on here again. I don't mind the ads but he was disrespecting the joule I bought every time he called it a sous vied stick!  I love grants videos but this dude seemed inexperienced. I wouldn't even know what a joule stick was with this. Let the dislike tell you what to never do again.
what happened with this channel
No videos for 7month!!
CHEFSTEPS WHERE IS THE CENTRIFUGAL MACHINE BRING IT BACK
Channel is dead?
What ever happened to these guys. No new vids
What happened to you guys?
how much did chef steps pay you tyler?
dude, get up
You guys gotta do something about the sound. It's becoming a deal breaker for a lot of people.
Where did you go
i actually paid money to subscribe for your dessert recipes. not one new one has been uploaded in months, not just desserts but ANYTHING. and STILL you just choose to ignore the thousands of comments made by subscribers. for real guys please just start uploading some CONTENT. one more joule and im unsubbed this is beyond a joke
I wonder what has been keeping these guys so silent. I hope they are cooking up some marvelous things.
What's with the lack of content recently?
Okay I'm done.
๊Up load more Video!!!
Never understood who this is for? People who can’t cook; nah because they won’t go to the trouble of pre searing souving and broiling. People who can cook; nah they’d probably just skip the souvied step.
Where did you guys go? It's almost a year?
Sucks we have to sit through a commercial to watch a commercial.
The irony of this is that the ad that was presented to me was for the Anova sous vide circulator... 😂
what happened to the channel?
This is sad. I miss Grant and the guys. You should have made a different channel to sell Joule, because it's killed your content and channel :(
Last video since 4 months. Is this channel dead? 

Did they run out of sous vide dishes?
Gets kicked off food network and now has to beg youtubers
We want more videos. Like every day lol
Wait, he had the chicken floating at the surface so that the top was out of the water...overnight?
Where's the new video ChefSteps? We miss you
hi how long was tyler florence on food network
So an ad....
Wish  these guys still made videos
Tyler is the kinda guy to sous vide pizza
where r u guys kinda miss u
I can't get over the fact that he calls it a stick instead of a tool
It's like they don't even read the comments and don't know what their viewers/subscribers want
oh boy. they are back
What do you guys not understand
Hello
So help me God, if you release one more "Joule" centered video I'm leaving
If you’re going to make something so subpar and try and sell something to me I need Grant topless in some tight shorts
Jesus Christ, Chef Steps you have such a bad business model for your YT channel. Joule is literally killing it! Stop trying to desperately shove it down peoples throats and go back to uploaded recipes that don't require sou vide machines.
where tf are the videos?
Anyone remember when ChefSteps made cooking videos and not Joule ads?
Are you alive?
Why aren't yall making videos anyone I miss you guys and ur videos.
I have loved TiVoing Tyler’s recipes. I tried most, and should have kept the very best in my vault. But, sadly my TiVo broke, and in the repairing, my best of the best was lost. Thank heavens Tyler Florence is available on YouTube. Tyler’s ultimate Chicken enchilada is to die for...and that is all I am going to say. 
FYI - Santa is bringing me a Sous Vide for Christmas. I need Tyler’s assistance once again to make me look like a fabulous cook.
~Nora 
Ps. I never share my recipes. Sorry, Tyler, I take full credit. Is that wrong? As they say, “Originality is the ability to conceal one’s source....”
Post more I miss you guys
What a bunch of sellouts.
where is riley?
So sad that Joule took over this channel and we can't see the great contents anymore. I used to love this channel, and thought it would soon reach millions of subscribers. I still can't understand why Chefsteps decided to lose it all for Joule ads.
Come back....!
What a terrible way to sous vide. Great way to get food poisoning. Half the damn turkey was outside the water.
No videos
Sous vide on Chef Steps?  Who'd thunk it?
i go straight for the thighs
why did yall stop posting? :/
so what if its an ad. why in the hell people watching it.
Is the Joule still castrated by requiring a smart phone to even function? Don't get me wrong, the app seems great, but you can't have a kitchen utensil that will may just stop working a few years down the line when technology changes. There is simply no excuse for this when manual controls to set a temperature are so trivial to implement.
i throw my food in my hot tub in a bag with a thermometer, cooks very well
Not sure I see the point in this video at all, because those of us who love sous vide/joule get absolutely nothing from this, and those that aren't interested in sous vide are tired of seeing the same old thing again and again. New content plan needed!
You're back on YouTube!
What has become of this channel?
How come they dont release videos anymore?
This channel has really gone downhill. I used to be a fan but now I will unsubscribe.
Where are you at????
I apologize if i'm out of line here, but I watch Tyler's video's on the Food Network. You guys have 700K+ subscribers and basically quit making videos. I bought Joule and love it and I know you're busy growing that side of the business, but you have a fan base here for a reason. It's become a Joule commercial channel basically...
Why did they stop making videos?
I’m sure the folks at Chefsteps would like to create awesome content for us cooking nerds. In the begining thats what they worked on because that’s how they made their money. My guess is, that their approach changed when they decided to develop the Joule and not use content as THE money maker.
what watch he's wearing ?
so what if they wanna push joule? their recipes rock!!! and i really like Grant, Nick and Ben. I don't mind paying for over priced Joule because I like them and I wanna support them. Even they'll only release sous vide recipes from now on. They are still amazing recipes. Above all, Joule haters: those videos are free! So stop complaining!!! Just don't watch it if it's not your thing!!!!!!!!
I'm not here to complain about the ad, I'm here to complain how he didn't completely submerge the bag in; it looks like it had some air left. You should remove the air first using the water displacement technique and put a metal spoon or something in the bag to keep it submerged in the water!
In the past I thought it was great that Joules taught me something while showing off their product... obviously someone internal thought it was too expensive or not effective or they wanted a more traditional audience... I have to unsubscribe though...this content is not unique or interesting
Can we get some new videos guys? You have been absent way too long. Where is the "I'm going to perfect this technique or use some ingrediant that i have not used before.?"
Does anyone know what happened to this channel?
Please release Joule in Canada!
Jusy amazing
Just put the turkey breast inside your girlfriend for 9 month and it will come out whole..  Foolproof
Where you guys at?
I cut the back out of a 12-14 pound turkey (seasoned with salt, pepper, and poulty seasoning) and roast it on 350 for about 3.5 hours on a base of onions carrots and celery  covered with parchment and foil. The skin isn't crispy but the whole turkey is juicy and the drippings are  great. It is based on a Martha Stewart receipe that I have been using for many years.
is this channel dead? should I unsub? it was a great content, sad...
How do you guys filter your frying oil so you can use it again
Wow so yummy delicious food
Plz upload new video
Do you guys have a restaurant ?
Wow! You've inspired me to buy a Anova!
Sous veed sue veeed sou viiiid suuuuuuuu veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
Where is my monthly video and my european joule? You guys created too much expectation
anyone know whats happened to chefsteps? used to really enjoy watching the videos :(
So you guys just don't make no videos no more?
Are you guys kidding me right now? It has been 10 f*cking months since ur last video! and I'm still waiting every single day for a new videos! just sth! anything! pls?
Why does it have so many downvotes?
I’m sorry chef you don’t know how to cook turkey 🦃
What happened to you guys? You coulda been youtube famous...
I know it's an amazing to show and promote the product you have made but can you consider to make videos that dont have joule? We all want good quality videos with science that is what make your subscriber subs u
You should change the name to: Souvide Steps
130 is not a safe temperature to hold food for that long.
Highly edited, like different turkey being seared and then exiting the oven
This guy is a boob, has issues with his verbal skills, and is not a good source of information other than propaganda for the Joule
Thumbs down
Hey, a new ChefStep video ! Grab popcorn ?
This was 9 months ago? I can't believe this. Im throwing away my Joule and getting an Anova.
I'm a die hard Chefsteps fan and I've been on it since 2014. But gosh dang it even I'm kinda disappointed in the recent quality of videos and recipes. I got Chefsteps premium from buying one of the classes for $10 three years ago. So I don't feel bad about the subscription aspect of it. But like everyone is saying; what the heck happened to all the bombtastic content with the sexy food videos?? Srsly, they were sooo beautiful. Some of it was like yeah I'm not a chef and I totally couldn't do that, but most of it made me feel like I COULD create restaurant quality food at home. It still amazes me that I can make Peking duck at home.  
It's not even that Chefsteps is peddling Joule, like ya I get it you guys need revenue. Its that its only Joule. For the love of tender turkey, come out with a new product or something. Everyone is getting sousvide fatigue! And you know the horse is done beat to dead when the oldies at Americas Test Kitchen are starting to get in on it. (No offense ATK but can't deny that they're slow to keep up with the times)
Also, Tyler Florence for spokesman?? Even I can tell hes excitement for Joule is like 0.00. He also drags the sexiness factor of joule down to Healthy Choices tv dinner. Look at that plate its so ugh. Joule is sexy! Its designed beautifully! Don't make it like hey y'all its like microwaving food but tender! Hyuck hyuck. 
 But I still love you guys.
I'm a simple man. I just want a video of you guys frying every food under the sun
Anyone else bug out about cooking in a plastic bag?
Ugh still missing the old chefsteps
Remember when ChefSteps made videos of really innovative and complex recipes? Those were good times
I'm so sick of the phrase "umami bomb".
Let me get a joule to Europe and this will definetly be all done by me. Love asian food cause it can be rich and hot but also sweet and savory. Great video, though you got a little bit too fast and fancy with the editing!
Nice editing and colour correction and pacing with the music. The mixing of the baste/sauces at 0:43..stunning work.
All that food looked so good, you can see why it's one of the best restaurants in Portland
Why is everyone so pissed 😬 am I the only one that's happy to see another person that's passionate about food
Have any of you guys seen Chef?
old chef steps - innovative recipes that take 5 days to make. I have no problem with non-innovative tasty recipes that I can actually do without a production crew.
I like this video and I'm not mad.
Burnt chicken skin, sous vide, unknown sauces.. whatever happened to the old Chef steps. Just watched a bunch of crap, free crap but still crap.
I was in Seattle last weekend (Oct 7 around 4 pm)  and stumbled upon ChefSteps office. I was so happy and was just staring through the door when the cutest guy came out with the cutest smile. Made my day,
So basically and AD for Gregory Gourdet?
People should stop hating. This is the best no voice over channel ever.
I challenge you to cook the perfect toast, as the Dr Dom Lane study revealed.
Thats awesome. Makes us feel hungry:)
All of it looks amazing!
Here just to read the comments
I stopped at "get recipes for all three..."
Other than that. Great technique.
Oh look, a new video from ChefSteps, totally not expecting the same old people to come back, dislike, and whine and moan in the comment section.
is riley still with chefsteps? :(
I gotta agree with the other comments. I find myself watching old videos and actually learning something. Have you considered making a sous vide specific channel, and then returning to the old format of videos on ChefSteps?
How could I put lavender flavor into a foam
Love the music nice vibes :)
Can you start labeling these advertisements so I can stop hoping it's actual content.
I think they're trying to figure out how to sous vide Toast
longer videos and more uploads please
Please just tell me if your video is going to be an Ad for your own product. Aren't there laws against that or whatever?
OK,  I would like to use a sous vide machine like yours, but I hate the idea of heating/cooking anything in a plastic material.  I refuse to use Teflon pans.
You want me to buy a Joule then please give me an alternative!
I love your all your videos but specifically like your videos about coffee! Wish you guys would make more videos about coffee!
Did someone dunk a piece of sushi in soy sauce in the intro?
Asian marinades for the grill are the best!! 👨‍🍳👍😊
The ad I saw before this was just two seconds of a black screen. Hands down the best ad I've ever seen. I got it confused with just laggy WiFi.
His level of charred crispy burned chicken skin is astounding which leave crack on my phone screen
The old demos were really good.  Now, all these video are a adverts for their sous vide product, whatever that overpriced thing is called. All sous vide products basically do the same thing, maintain a set water temperature, most of the professional ones are far better.  Interesting that it says "show us how it's done, sir" then doesn't show you how it's done.  What a joke!
Extremely appealing these videos are. Awesome is just the word!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍🏻👍🏻😍👍🏻😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😍😍😍😍
This would be more like "joule ads". 😒
is it just me or that chicken is burnt?
How come you guys never upload new videos anymore..?
:(
Me no likey...
I'll say this and this only. I cannot accept these asian recipe tips from a man who cannot hold chopsticks right.
Nailed it? You mean burnt it.
Can you guys do us all a favor and shut down this channel?
That was a disappointing video. Chefsteps should just shut down the channel! The guys there aren't interested in content-creation anymore.
Looks good!
Man, I feel so bad for Grant. It's always just complaint after complaint. You guys know they still post the in-depth recipes on their website? Also, you guys know they posted videos on how to sous vide without Joule or another device?

--

Anyways, I'm loving those marinades I can't wait to try try them out. More sauce recipes please!!
Chef steps, you guys are killing yourselves. Your food still look delicious, but the videos aren't good. You have an amazing tool called the comments, and you can literally see hundreds of people telling you the same thing
its... freaking burnt
One time I saw Grant and co having lunch in my neighborhood here around Seattle and I had to go up and fanboy.  I doubt that would be the same these days.
New Chefsteps is sh1t, bring old back please.
That not Chinese pls
Бред
I miss the old videos😫
I am extremely disappointed in chef steps they seem to delete any comments that they don't like even from people the chose to support them buy purchasing premium , I could understand if the comments were bad in anyway but they aren't. 
Sometimes people may post things looking to ensure they are doing things right only to have their comments deleted , quite sad if you ask me .
Have a problem with a comment , reply to it and set the person straight !
Is this channel dead now?
Well that was a waste of 2 minutes, I think the idea of the whole "other peoples ideas" means they don't have to do anything of the hard work themselves. I understand the marketing side to this, to advertise Joule, but it has gone too far and they seem to have lost any from of actual creativity or originality that they used to have. Also it's one thing to colour or slightly char the outside of the chicken for flavour but that is burnt. I don't care what people say about sugars burning or the fact it's called 'Thai black pepper chicken' or that it's only the outside, from an aesthetic point of view it's burnt and I'm sure once you put a piece in your mouth the outside with overpower the centre and it will taste... burnt!
i highly doubt the dude knows how a chasiu is made
горелое дно
what happened to this channel? are they done making videos now?
I'll always love Chefsteps but c'mon guys, this video was straight up advertising than an "Other People's Ideas" segment.
Even not Asian
The  chicken is kinda burn.......
great videos
Remember those people who constantly complained about not having a centrifuge on "old chefsteps" videos?  They are the same ones complaining about how the "new chefsteps" is too simple for them.
This channel used to be much more than outright advertisement.   Sorry guys, unsubscribed.
Is the Sous Vide process hot enough to render fat on something like a steak?
Sorry please don't call that char siu. It's not even 1% close to it. That is just pork with sauce.
Too be honest , I love joule , but give people what they want or this business will fail
Please don't be another infomercial for their sous vide machine...Please don't be another infomercial for their sous vide machine...Please don't be another infomercial for their sous vide machine...crap, another infomercial for their sous vide machine...
Dear ChefSteps, please give us a note explaining why there are no more videos and receipts like  used to be.  Are you going to produce them again? A sad premium user...
complain less. unsubscribe more. All that matters to them any more is numbers.
thats called chicken with cancer!... blackened chicken... haha
Quit playin' that chicken  was leather
Finesse, Technique, Performance, Execution, and a nice musical track to spare.
People in the comment section... Honestly, you either can't afford a Joule, or you're too lazy to find out how to make a homemade sous-vide cooker using a cooler, thermometer, and hot water. 

Use your little brains, some effort, and cook yourself the best meat you've ever had, or the first meal you've ever cooked for yourself.

Get over it.

Sincerely, someone who cooks better/more than you ever have, with or without the sous vide technique.
Those all look delicious, thanks for sharing Chef Steps! Can't wait to give that Korean steak a go with my Joule.
Is it safe to say that this channel is officially dead?
is this qvc without explanation? feels like a youtube ad
ugh stop complaining guys. im sure not even 10% of us actually try out their recipes/tricks in real life. before joule was a thing they used to make extremely complicated dishes with ingredients and equipment nobody had at home but no one complained about it. y'all are just hating because they're selling something now.
"WHY DO THE GUYS WHO ARE BEST KNOWN FOR SOU VIDE RECIPES AND WHO OPERATE A PROFESSIONAL TEST KITCHEN KEEP MAKING VIDEOS WHERE THEY SOU VIDE AND USE INGREDIENTS THAT PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE IN THEIR CUPBOARDS!?! I'M FURIOUS ABOUT THIS FOR SOME REASON!!!!!111" - The comments on literally every ChefSteps video
maybe if we all say how much we miss the old chefsteps, they'll bring it back....
White people idea
Is not it dangerous to cook in a bag?
Can you sous vide oysters?
ok. why just 1 minute videos. why

what else are you guys working on
The comment section for chefsteps videos sure is a negative place right now. Even videos that don't have joule have people moaning about joule. Really if you don't like it so much just unsub and leave room for people who want to talk about food.
Jesus Christ how strong are his glasses?
 Eyeballs bigger than the moon
Oyster + cheese = WOW
No need to flip' em?
So I don't Sou Vide the Oysters?
Damn, my neighbors think I like this type of music😩
nobody's the boss of anything on their knees
I want you do a will it sous vide.
Nice comparison of the undercooked/ perfect/ overcooked.
looks amazing an yet I've never tried oysters
This is the trick to turn an oyster hater into a lover
the way oyster looks makes me never wanna try it
At the beach now!!! But I want them raw. 😊
Best way to grill oysters. Don't. Use Joule.
Sous vide
"TraineeSteps" returns
Love my Joule, but this company has gone to hell as far as useful content.
i dont even like oysters
Does anyone know the song title of this video?
I loved ChefSteps from the beginning, but it seems that after all the hype with Joule.  They just took the money and ran....too bad, they used to have great content!
Firs
inb4 "I hate these tip and tricks! but I never go on the Joule app or the website to see their new recipes neither!!!"
ive been a loyal fan. but seriously. did people run out of ideas? or stopped making new dishes?
T
I wish there was a new chefsteps video every single day! I can't remember how often I have watched all the videos
Hey don't litter bad example for the kids
Did you guys get rid of Grant or something?   Is that why the videos are all these 1 minute commercial type videos and not the fun goofy videos with grant that gained you all the subs you have today?
real recipes?
nice, but don't litter, at the end
Why do I feel like every recent Chefsteps video has just been a compilation of their latest dinner party celebrating their buckets of Joule money, dressed up as an educational video? RIP this channel :(
this channel won't exist by next year
I challenge you guys to do salt bae meme
another pointless video. content please
I never understood why in the US you love to cook oysters when it is heaven just raw with some shallots vinegar with some rye bread and butter. Not judging here, just saying.
Did you really just cook a steak without sous viding it? *shocked
ChefSteps where are the videos with presenter? Grant? We miss ur talking and all the weird sound effects u make
I miss when this channel was just artsy food porn. Take me back to those days.
I'm a really big fan of your channel and I appreciate the cinematography and all that but I mean you've been slacking and like idk it feels like your not putting much effort in the video ideas anymore. Another problem is, it's either " use the joule or nothing " or like " obvious tips everyone is aware about ". Don't take this as a hate comment just take it as constructive criticism.
love the background,.so festive!
so this is Gilles, the new ChefSteps cast iron pan?
Umm where do I put my joule on the grill?
I look forward to more in-depth tutorials... this was... well, I dunno, not very good. 

That hex-pan looks nice, but it seems like it might be a pain to clean.
im a pastry chef and bought chefs steps premium for the dessert recipes. you have not made any dessert or even sweet related video in about a year. instead its just 1 minute videos on obvious tips or using damn joule. this channel has gone very downhill
This channel has gone downhill, are you guys even still at the office? Or can you not afford it anymore? I wouldn't be surprised if it was the latter.
Wait, aren’t I supposed to sous vide that steak? My world is collapsing.
What happened to my boy grant making cool and wierd dishes
I honestly thought this was gonna be a sponsorship for a new pan they have that you can put on the grill
i would like to see "how to grill with JOULE" :D
Found only one reason in this video... the rest were just food you could cook on a grill... in a pan...
kinda pointless.
I swear to god, sometimes I think I'm the only person who still likes this channel's content.
Where's the recipe videos? With nick and Gavin and Riley... those were fun. These are just lazy montages. I love chefsteps, you guys inspired me to really strive for my dreams of being a chef. Can you keep doing that? Xx
I NEED to know this song. Please.
Can you post the recipe for your queso fundido?
As a spanish I'm offended by that "paella", I expected that from Jamie Oliver but you guys always tryed to keep it authentic.
The glaring mistake in this video was assuming everyone would infer that they're supposed to close the lid so they can get smoke flavor.
i miss grant...
No sous vide on the grill?
I Grill kalbi in a pan. It comes out nice. 👨‍🍳👍😊
Gotta say chefsteps, content has dipped sharply...... what was a regular channel is now a....... naaah they havent posted anything but a 5 second snap clip in a while now, whats jamie doing.
DOWNHILL GUYS, DOWNHILL.
What has happened to Chef Steps?
Song is "Light a Fire" by Kid Prism.
What is ChefSteps anymore? ZZZZZZ
Killer tunes!
With our OTR microwave not working for a while, I'm basically doing prep indoors, and the cooking outside. It's great! You can let it rip without worrying about the smell indoors.
Honestly, I don't know what happened with this channel. I was a long time fan. They have great videos but the fan base interaction is dead. I ended up buying an Anova sous vide cooking and convinced 4 other friends to get one too. Those sales could've have been towards Joule but you guys haven't showed much appreciation for your fans. Grant, I hope you're reading this. Joule should be the new household name for sous vide cooking. You guys gotta amp up your marketing and give your fans a little showmanship. Let us know you hear us.
That's an argentine grill!!!!!
You have 650k subs... There are people who have turn audiences smaller than that into entire businesses, yet you use it to post low effort videos and ads for Joule, which at this point isn't unique, there are plenty of other sous vide cookers for less money on the market. You know you've fucked up in the PR department when subscribing to your channel actively pushes people away from your company and products.
Wheres joules for international?
It's been a long time since I"ve been motivated to make anything from this channel, but I might have to try that queso fundido. Cheers to change!
The cs comments section. Your daily source of culinary smh.
These commenters ALWAYS have something to complain about.
Music is dope doe.
So, don't smoke up the house was the only reason then?
Unsubscribe squad where u at
I'm thinking of cancelling my one-time purchase, lifetime subscription to premium content because this channel has turned into such garbage. 

Low effort trash.
lol
Hi! I'm a Spanish girl and, believe me, that is not a paella...
Can I use sous vide the pan?
how am I supposed to use my Jule on the outdoor grill? do I need an extension cord? or do I have to pay you $40 for private cooking video lessons on your main web page to find out?
They are simply making way more money from the local cooking classes and lessons they offer whereever they are located. Why would they care about a youtube channel that served its purpose, spread the word around , got them money from Joule to turn it into an ad channel. Its outlived its purpose. Time to pack it up.
I needed this... Thank you
Please come back to a higher level, I got premium to get knowledge and ideas, not this "get on a grill with the family" thing you are doing right now... Get it good like it use to be, more research on sous vide, new sauces and side dishes. I would love a segment on Deli style food but remastered with your skills and creativity.
The song is nice and jazzy, do you have a guy who writes music for you?
A harsh downwards plummeting degradation to "TraineeTips" with a twist of "kthx4info"
This channel was great once, apparently they've got other stuff to focus on now
Why have you'll stopped posting videos?
dang all that looks good. Why does everyone hate this channel all of a sudden? Joule is legit, the tips are legit, the production is legit.....I hope these negative comments don't translate to "bad ratings" or whatever - keep this goodness going!!
Came here for inspiring videos from cooks with passion in their eyes. Videos about perfection without needing to be perfect. Cooks that inspire people and show people, like me, how to up their food game without being a professional. 

Please come back to us guys, because these 'tips and tricks' can be found all over the internet, and the way you did videos before, cannot.
If you're cooking mussels use a wok, not a skillet....
I just made the gluten free cookies that you guys made here a few years ago. Made them for my sister whose Celiac's affects her ability to enjoy my baking and most beers. Also made the spongey chocolate cake, the Olive Oil Cake was beloved by my roommates and the smokeless smoky ribs wowed the neighbors. I'll definitely be buying a Joule this Christmas.
Is time to unsubscribe? This was an awesome channel
isn't the whole point of grilling the smoke and char by not having a metal barrier between the food and the flame.....this negates all that.
Awesome video; never thought that way always hated veggies falling through the grill. Haters gonna hate from their mom's basement sitting on a folding chair.
Hope to see some more of the how to type videos again
This is trash
Fun music. Terrible video. You guys used to inspire me.
I used to love this channel. Now you guys upload crap videos that are meaningless. Most of them are even less than a minute long. I don't understand how you expect to keep a following with this.
First
you guys are back!
Where can I find that pan?
Just a tip: don´t call almost every kind of rice "paella". Paella is just an specific plate.
Where's the sous vide? LOOOOOOL!
Neat trick - but can I really just take some garden cuttings like that indiscriminately- no major change in flavor or aroma?
I thought it said turn plant scraps into smoked MEATS.  I was so confused because I was expecting some vegan meat alternative made out of plant scraps lmao.  But that's pretty cool though, bet it tastes unique.
This is a very badly named video. A more correct title would be "Smoke meats with plant scraps" if you wanted to keep the same words (sounds better than "Smoke meats with lawn waste" I suppose.)
Saw your grill and have an equipment question...whats better and why..."V" shaped grill or round bars?  Id like your 2 cents on this...
I was waiting for them to burst out a Joule and heat the charcoal sous vide style
I thought this was actually about turning plant scraps into meals....
will be good until someone uses poison oak/ivy
Nice.  Can I ask, what kind of grill is this?
I found my smoked carp acquired a brighter flavor if I put my dandelions in Joule before adding them to the coals.
Make sure those same erbs weren't sprayed with pesticides or herbicides...or just stick to woodchips.
Lame af
Love the look of this grill! Who made it?
Step 3: Put lawn clippings in grill
I guess this means the next video is about Joule.
All I have are weeds and dirt in my garden. Does dirt do fine?
Just make sure not to get pieces of onion or garlic in the fire because that smoke actually tastes horrible. Dried skins of alliums and dried herbs are great though, just make sure it's all pretty dry!
Jesus, the most laziest videos ever...wtf happened to this channel.
What happened to you guys :( ?
You get 1 more chance from me....
Great tip!
Soo lovely videos
can i use weed to smoke the salmon
Smart!! Normally at home when I'm gonna smoke an ingredient, I place the flowers, hay or the wood chips In a pan, heating it up or blow torching it until smoke appears,  adding some foil and then the ingredient on top, and putting a lid on to close in the smoke. Works every time!! 😄
There is a ton of really interesting recipes and professional tips at your website and that is why I paid for premium, and I am happy with it, great material, I am sure you will do better than this later, keep at it you are the best guys!
this comment is more interesting than this video
Lack of sous vide amuses me
did they blow up their kitchen or what is this content?
You know it's serious when the seasoning is just salt and pepper, no garlic powder. >>> do7.pl/ia1m
Wow! So glad I waited a FULL WEEK for a 13 second video...🙄😒
Who does this? 🤔 Raise your hand!! 🤚
Joule?
Finally! No Sous vide!
I really don't like talkless videos

I want to listen while I do other things

If I wanted to read with music in the background id look up the recipe while listening to music
cool...so i can just grab whatever flowers and throw them on to smoke my food, man who would have thought those poisionous plants in my garden were actually secret ingredients just waiting to be used. what a stupid video.
yay! Cancer!!
It's great that you didn't name Joule. It felt like less of an ad. A step forward. However, we still miss the more in-depth, thorough content about complex recipes. That's the reason I subscribed in the first place.
Woah this is actually a really clever way to use sous vide... Much Closer to the old chefsteps
40% people here for the food porn, 30% wants to cook 20% got a sousvide tool 10% people who hates joule
Using sous vide is actually a very good idea, as kebabs are usually very tough for me to enjoy.
This is a great idea! I LOVE your videos! Keep up the great work. I always look forward to new sous vide videos from you guys. Thank you!
If I put that much effort in advance to invite people over for grilled kebabs, they better be bringing some nice wine and/or beer :)
I like how Joule was more "in the background" in this video instead of how they used to say "COOK WITH JOULE!!!!" outright. Awesome.
I miss the old content around desserts, cocktails, multicourse meals, etc.
I will Don this today
Thanks from egypt
I really like that barbecue include kimchi!!! Am i right???
Those vegetables arent gonna be done, unless you wanna overcook the meat
long time no see, sous vide
This channel is so soulless now. What happen to all the boys and energy.... This channel died when riley left.
I like new concepts but I really miss their old soothing musics.
Oh god, pork kabobs? Really?
Im all for sousvide, I run a website around it.  But this is a bit excessive.  

I was able to make sous vide tamales... That lengthens the time by 4x longer than It should be.  You've done this with kababs...

(The tamales were delicious!)
getting better on the Joule ads...
When shish kebab is “kebab” 🙄 Middle Easterners will understand
chefsteps suggesting us to use joule? groundbreaking.
cool, raw vegetables and pre cooked meat
Stay tuned for Chef Steps' next video - Cleaning your Grill with Joule™
Just so you know, I was really excited about this channel, you've got some great looking videos on here. However, I then found out that maybe 50% of your videos are just pushing the joule. I'm never going to get that, and I doubt most people on YouTube with bother either. It is killing your channel you could be really successful without it...
EU compatible Joule please :)
Did that, what i should have done was put the meat in the fridge first to stop it from overcooking since the vegetables take their damn sweet time getting grilled. Made a baba ghannoush with a sousvide, just add a bit og liquid smoke to that pealed eggplant. Alternatively you can also hit the peel with a torch, put it in a tea bag and shove it in the bag with the eggplant.
This is a no from me dawg
genius
...Why didn't I know about korean bbq kebabs before.
I'm here for chefsteps not plebsteps
No hassle? really?
The vegetables won't be done if you only finish the brochettes on the grill. Or the meat will be overdone if you fully  cook the vegetables. 
Maybe we should cook the veggies separately? For a really hassle-free way of doing this, I recommend sous-vide.
It was never a hassle they made that up
Just unsubscribed, I hung in but sorry not the same.
That looked delicious. Just a note: Kebab is the minced meat, seasoned and formed into a sausage shape. The mix of vegetables and meat chunks is called Shish-tawook.
Salaam from Middle east .
They eat our food but slaughter our children.
i think thats enough for me. you guys used to have really great content but now its all an ad for joule.

peace, chefsteps.
it takes a team of hipsters weeks to get a video like this out?
What was that white stick with the light on in the box?
Why you grilling cucumber? At the first look it looks like the skewer consists courgette. It´s just my opinion, but cucumber is rather better for salads and cold meals, than for cooking. But anyway nice recipe.
Rainier you fn hipsters
wait - grilled cucumber?
oh wow...another sous vid video.
I guess you can only make so many vids when everything is based on sous vide
why do they always tell you to sous vide everything
I never mix meat and veg on the same skewer. Vegetables (such as onions, peppers and mushrooms,) take much longer to cook properly. Put them on well before any meats or seafoods and they will get charred, flavorful and tender.
... This is just lame chef steps. I mean you used to do amazing stuff like the impossible quail egg. Now you are sous vide kebabs?? It is just boring.
that is one of the worst looking kimchi out there lmao
fresh kimchi (prob around 1 or 2 weeks old in fridge), barely any juice
Sous vide
lame
i love u chefsteps♡
I make georgian shashlik, but that one looks fun and tasty too.
Miss old content, now it seems like an endless stream of joule commercials :(
Sous vide is good but everything doesn't have to b prepared that way
"No hassle" Sousvide for 24 hr and cuts meat into perfect cubes
Hey hey hey
0:23 seconds in, the first joule plug
I figured this wouldn't involve sous vide for sure
This is one where I'm super curious if there's a sous vide (because we're already going to have it out) fully vegetarian/vegan kebab option. (I may like meat, but if I brought just these to a party my vegetarian friends would be sad. And I like my vegetarian friends.) Of course now I'm going to find myself in two hours still looking up tofu sous vide options...
Ultimamente i video che fate sono troppo semplici.
hmmm. this video earned my unsubscribe. this video was basically "how to make great kabobs: cook meat sous vide and then make kabobs. amazing"

goodbye chef steps!
No way those veggies are going to be cooked enough once the meat is done (pre-cooked)
Food turns out much better if you SousVide the coals first.
Chefsteps has gone from meticulously detailed food preparation to "Aw, !@# it, throw it all on the fire."  Quite the progression
Anyone else annoyed that the music doesn't loop perfectly?
I miss the old chefsteps which gives us molecular tips, recipes etc.
ok chefsteos, can you PLZ stop being insider and do good videos again?
Chefsteps coming out with another video of something Alton brown told us to do years ago haha
Suspect music
Should I use Joule before or after on the scallops?
Make ChefSteps great again
Next week's video features burping sock puppets and an Asian chiropractor in a lab coat.

NEW AND ORIGINAL CONTENT!
Ah I always love your video, please do more
the music is better than the actual cooking tips
put a whole leek in those coals, give it 5 or 6 minutes, ditch the charred outside, eat the sweet and soft flesh inside. 

THE BEST!
Wtf?! Where is Joule
A fine shoe turning into an old shoe?
Please don't loose your identity, keep it unique.
the music has an odd time measure
Don't forget to put a Joule inside that grill
There are historycal records here in Argentina that the criollos and the gauchos cooked asados (argentinian style barbecues) and beef straight on the wood/charcoal or using wooden or iron stakes. Only by 1900s the grills where slowly introduced into the country.

Also in the countryside there are still some times on special ocations where the whole animal is cooked, skin on, on the woods
The count on your music loop is slightly too short.
You are criminals to give these tips: carbonized foods are cangerogens. reckless!
I miss the old chefstep when they have some real videos.
So what were the tips and tricks exactly? These were just not that I think............ I am confused
Chefsteps running out of idea
I-want-more
I. Learnt. Nothing.
Make JOULE available in Europe!!!!
Turkish style burst of smoke flavour
Disappointed. Came to see sou vide promotion saw this.
Put a Joule on there.
Omg fix the music
not enough explaination
I'd rather interesting SV recipes than this tbh
You missed the bananas as a dessert.. anyway.. roasted bananas with cinamon and butter..
This is a great way to sear steaks once sous vide ;)
Very healthy!!!!
That's great, but can I ask you about Joule?
More videos, please!
The lack of sous vide in this video is disturbing
Stop being fn lazy and put out a fn real educational video for once.  Everything lately is fn crap and i know I'm not the only one who feels this way
eating cancer. tasty.
Hey Guys, welcome to Chefsteps and today I'm going to show you how to get the ultimate use out of your grill! So the first thing you want to do is get a bag of charcoal and lay out a few nice,big,pieces. Next you want to get out a medium sized boiling pot and fill it up half way or 3/4 of the way, we really want to make sure we get these charcoals soaking. Next get your joule and place it in the pot set it to a desired temperature, then simple place your charcoals in the pot and sous vide them

Looks like our charcoals are done! Next we wanna get them out of the pot and admire them. Now what I like to do is get them soaking in a nice ice bath to help them retain that nice blocky shape, when that is done, get your homemade steak knife and cut into the charcoal

Yep, that what we are looking for we have that nice,dark,firm, outside and a nice,soft,chewy, inside!mmmmmmmmm
Now you can also throw these on the grill and use them to sear up some vegetables. Well that's it for us today, visit our website and check out our classes and joule and we'll see you soon.
Alton Brown used to do this, but carcinogens
You can do this with stuff like peppers or corn with the husk but not scallops or anything without a skin lol really. Charcoal is good for something but not on your food
This channel sucks now
this comment section is cancer.
to everyone losing their minds about "cancer" i recommend you never ever eat that Extebarri
Hey guys, can you make a video about cooking in an earth oven, as in beneath the ground? That would be pretty cool I think.
ewwww
that is disgusting,all of that dirt will stuck on the food
I do this with potatoes and sometimes steak. I think I'm going to do this on more things.
cancer
Yes. No joule
2nd
5th!
isn't there a problem with ashes?
This is a neat idea, and thank you for showing us. :)
Instructions unclear. Put Joule in the fire.
you missed the step where you throw the burned and ash covered food in the garbage... but thanks for the great "tips"
I have been a member since the beginning and I really miss the videos where you guys actually cooked food and opend my eyes to the mind of a chef no mather if it was food safety or what not.. Any thing new in the pipeline? It's been to long with "other peoples ideas" and other not so interessent ideas..
I love the mini super grill, i picked this up from Alton Brown a while back.
If you want to see a brick explode and ruin your  stone work. Do what you see in this video. bricks are not meant and can't hold up to that heat and will explode with enough force to lift and knock other the chimney and leave a large crater in your patio. 

I love the videos from chefsteps . Some if the best cooking and food videos being made but don't do this on pavers. Gravel and or sand is safer.
i saw kenji and adam savage do this 2 years ago IIRC, it's  cool way to grill though you need to be super organised, also have a cambro ready to hold your food while you cook the next item (the chimney's surface area can only cook 1 thing at a time).
Thanks, Alton!
Alton brown and a lot of others are way ahead of you on this one lol.
my favorite type of video was the super awesome music with closeups and awesome artistry/editing
Nearly started a grass fire in my backyard with this. As a Central Valley Californian, do this in a controlled environment away from dry grass areas and in an area you don't mind turning into a naped wasteland.
Thank you god, i love joule and all but its good to see different types of cooking videos on this channel.
Always had a great love for this nifty tool! I use a blow dryer or those small battery operated gadgets that blow up inflatable mattresses for extra kick! Leaf blower is extreme😄
grill the joule
Good idea, but what's it going to look like with that big black burn spot in the nice brick paver patio. Obviously, this guy didn't buy the patio pavers. 
For the most part, I'm hooked on this site. It's never happened that I've witnessed anything this dumb or is it inconsiderate

Gordon Ramsay joins ChefSteps

Sous Vide plugin 

add water

put your fresh Sous Vide in a vacuum bag and then place in the Sous Vide 

set your Sous Vide for 69 min/420C

cook the Sous Vide 

pull bag out of Sous Vide, empty your cooked Sous Vide on the plate 

season with a little bit of chopped up joule and lamb sauce

and there we have it fresh Sous Vide cooked in a Sous Vide seasoned with joule
Great idea! I wonder if corn would come out well with this.
Hey that octopus is moving! Did you cook it alive?
So I don't sou vide the grill?
There is a joule inside the fire?
if you don't have a leaf blower, use a hair drier!
Did he just put RAW meat on the grill?
Love it!  Some times simplicity is the best :)
was that squid ALIVE????
Why does chefsteps Barely ever upload now
Wow, that grill is steaming HOT!
Yall Got Any More Of Those Squids?
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
Is this Insider?
squid on that thing is probably incredible
How do I sous vide this grill?
Bring back the old videos!!!!
Strangely, just thinking about this the last few days, thanks for being tuned in and on the wavelength of subscribers!. I think someone could do well to make a circular grill to fit the Weber Fire Starter perfectly. (I live alone and love BBQ food).
wow im really glad i spent 2 weeks eagerly awaiting a video for it to be 56 seconds long...🙄😒
When will we be able to buy Joule internationally?
Alton Brown suggested using newspaper with a spritz of vegetable oil as it works the same as a candle. I use 3 paper towels with a few tablespoons of oil.  Works every time and don't have to worry about any strange chemicals from the newspaper.
wtf this isn't sous vide
haha,  yes!  I knew I wasn't the only one who did this.  My favorite on the chimney starter is getting a crusty char on kabob.
a hair dryer by the grill can do wonders
Nice kicks bro 😑
You forgot the part when the stuff is sous-vide'd. ;)
That would even make sense in this case. :D
are some of the meats sous vide before you grill them?
I'm surprised they didn't sous vide the steak before they put it on
Pro tip. Put the charcoal chimney inside your charcoal grill to do this. I use the removable 8" center grate from my Weber to put on top. If you like to sear then cook you can also easily dump the coals into the Weber after searing.
Wow I'm early
Yeah you totally didnt steal this from AB
ein Laubbläser von Stihl..... sehr sehr geil 👍
We use these to prepare the coal, followed by putting them into the big grill.
I'm very hungry now
that grain fed cow tho
cool
Great one
Thats squid was moving
those squids were still alive ! its unhuman !
Can you hack a chimney starter to become a pizza oven? Just need the right metalwork around it surely?
This method is only good for creating crusts and seafood that needs only 2 min cook time
I just scrolled down here to see if anyone commented on the squid... It's disappointing
Way too hot.  This can blacken the meat if you’re not careful
Amateur hour. Notice the brand new chimney and burnt cancer marks on the meat? There's better ways of grilling that's better tasting and healthier using the same equipment... You just need to know how to do it, these people don't.
This looks cool but just cause you got grill marks on your food doesn't mean it's cooked thoroughly.
What good are Tips & Tricks if you shouldn't try them at home?
But the burning question is.......................can you use sous vide to heat it up?
The leaf blower it's a pretty bad idea...
First
Is the squid still alive?
Nice first view, awesome video keep it up
WOW ANOTHER JOULE AD. SELLOUTS!!!@!
Wow, i half expected you to do the barbecue sous vide with the joule... 
Probably in the next video...
"Alton!  Alton, it's Marvin. Your cousin, Marvin Brown. You know that new hot mini-grill you're looking for? Well, listen to this!"

"Uh, huh?  You already did this, like years ago?  And these guys are hacks?  And did they at least cite you in their video?  Uh, no, but at least there weren't any obvious commercials for that goddamn sous vide machine.  Alton?  Alton, hello?"
you guys used to make awesome videos, wiith high end plating and superior technique. now its quite obvious that you are just trying to sell Joule, thats fine and all you gotta get yours but god damnit do i miss the old chef steps
most of ChefSteps is just advertising for Joule or however you spell it. No ACTUAL tips. Sorry, I was disappointed with this channel too.
facts.. everything was undercooked inside. good way to mark your proteins tho.
Great video, but I have none of these things in my pantry. Do they have a recipe for half a pot noodle and a packet of skittles?
I kind of turned up my nose at this at first. But the more I think about it the more I think it's quite clever. People have been conditioned to be wasteful. It's easy to dismiss leftovers as useless or inedible especially when you want to cook a fresh new dish. I like this approach- it's experimental. Some bits might be crap, but some things might turn out much better for having incorporated an unusual spare ingredient. And besides, reducing food waste can only be a good thing.
Whatever happened to recipes presented by the people over at ChefSteps? Ben? Riley? Nick? CAMP???
Came here for all the salty comments. I wasn't disappointed.
Here come the complaints about Joule. Honestly people, whether it is Joule or any other Sous Vide machine, or as they have shown before you can do it without one, Sous Vide is a very nice technique to add to your kitchen. I picked up an el cheapo Sous Vide circulator cause I cannot afford the Joule and have been using it almost daily for the past two months or so. IT IS AMAZING. Best purchase of my life, and will be a permanent addition to my kitchen for the rest of said life. 147 degree pork tenderloin is to die for, and a super cheap dinner, I can throw a dinner for two together for $2.75 and by using Sous Vide (and the equilibrium brine Chef Steps showed me) it comes out so tender you don't even need a knife to eat it. Plus I buy the whole tenderloin, portion it up and freeze it, then just plop in the water to cook for 3 hours and I am off doing other things.  I could sit here and gush about Sous Vide all bloody day.... Stop hatin, it is worth learning the technique!
So is "carbonizing" vegetables actually just burning them or is there a difference?
I'm just glad something was sous vide.
Do they work at Dorsia?
always find a way to remind us of joule
Alternate Title: How to trick people to eat your trash!
Wow, thats freaking awesome, love it. Don`t throw think green ;)
Cook sous vide with Joule, sure :)
This is awesome!!!!!!
I was disappointed with the recipe for broiled veggie scraps.  (See 1:22).  Couldn't these be made somehow be cremated with Joule?
Great video, but can I get a source on the music please? :) :)
these guys are absolutely brilliant. Great video. Thank you
Gosh.. absolutey genius
Hipster paradise.  I'll pass. Very nice production though.
Impressive. And I was the one who thought I could make most of left-overs.
Could you guys do a video about how to store food, and organizations for shopping threw the week , so to minimize food waste! Please!!
Yeah use 10 other ingredients to use 1 leftover haha
Love, love, love. Well done Brothers! We throw away so much food, re-inventing it is not a crime!
smoky ash looks rather carcinogenic
That rice thing looked amazing!
create a five-star meal with things other people would have thrown out!
...like chicken. and eggs. and cream. and nuts. and lots of fresh vegetables.
here 's me writing down my shopping list from this recipe
So incredible and so inspiring. Well done Brothers & Co
Good luck getting the smoke smell out of your blender
thank you for make me hate my food system
This video was sooo soothing to watch.
don't wanna throw the $1.29 lb of old rice that you cooked? spend $1000 on a dehydrating machine to make rice crisps that's not even the main dish.
wish you guys didn't do so many sous vide recipes not a lot of people have them
Don't know what just happen in that video
I hoped to learn what a "pop-up chef team" was. I still do.
That's a really complicated way to make Krupuk
music's on point
Reignites the creative culinary juices
As long as it's still edible, it doesn't count as leftovers for me
i'd watch 5 joule videos to get that fried chicken recipe
I'm pretty sure turning those veggies into ash turns them into carcinogens cause you're charring the organic compounds into carbon. Is it safe to ingest?
Really cool and useful ideas right there.  The rice puffs is one im really gonna take advantage of.
Very cool video. Not exactly useful for me though, i think the complaints are mostly from people like me who have some month left over on the end of their money, YAKNOW. So if you have some scraps and leftovers its nice to not have to buy 10 other things including salmon and stuff. 
Still, cool video.
Don't get why so many people are whining about Joule or Chefsteps premium...I mean they create amazing free content alongside it. Besides Joule and premium are great resources for those who want it. I do miss seeing the OG chefs though :)
the pantry cookies and rice puffs were interesting. but I think you could roll it back and turn the stale rice into congee for one last push. idk
I remember a time when i watched Chefsteps for food and not sweet tunes!... so so long ago
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Omg 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
It's not aioli without garlic. Of all the groups to mess that up, I sure didn't think it would be ChefSteps!
These ads are the best.
I love Joule... my issue is "a meal from scraps" where most of the major ingredients are presented from off-stage.  Fried Chicken!!!!  Etc, etc... I own a joule and love it.. I just don't need Chefsteps content to make good meals... and that (somehow?) makes me sad.
funny how theyre turning kitchen "scraps" into an abundant feast that's gonna leave even more scraps.
This never works for me.  If I use my old roasted veggies to make a pot a creme (with a ton of new ingredients), I end up with tons of leftover pot a creme.  The cycle never ends so it's better to just discard any leftovers that remain in the refrigerator past 24 hours.
this channel is not what it's use to be
Hello
can you guys please make a strudel
You guys don't understand how you literally just turned my life around. I was an aspiring chef until I recently lost my passion, flame, inspiration and motivation to innovate and create due to the pressure to pursue a more "stable" career (I just graduated H.S). since the release of this video I've been cooking nonstop, messing around with the most random ingredients I found in my pantry. I feel as if the same fire I felt when i first discovered the joy of cooking has just been lit. Thank you.
you mean you can sous vide your pantry?
you could say chefsteps IS out of thier own ideas
..... There's only three stars in the Michelin guide. Where does the two more come from ?
Song name? bangs
Instead of crying over the missing Joule, put it on a cake pan and bake it covered with aluminum foil on a double bath in the lowest temperature you can get it on your oven for one hour, voilà. The difference is that you will have to slice it afterwards and plate it instead of serving it on jars.  You are welcome.
People are hating on this video too much. The joule video annoyed me but this one was fine. I wouldn't expect a meal to 100% food scraps and still taste really good. This is what what I would expect from chef steps, people are bashing it again in the comments but I really enjoyed it
Chef steps is about to go out of business
Consuming ash and burnt items is known to cause cancer! Thumbs up so people can be aware of the risk.
Lol at those burnt veggies, smh
Would you get a stomachache eating all these new combinations? Like junk food with produce, different salad dressings. I got a stomachache from eating salad dressings or other condiments before, maybe it was old or I shouldn't have shook the bottle.
First person to watch this video and first person to like
That's bad ass. Ash aioli, c'mon that's slick.
This is awesome - but isn't it unsafe to reheat rice that's been sat within 10 - 50 degrees C?
Trying to figure out how that Ash Mayo could taste anything other than disgusting burntness. Anybody have a clue?!?  I've burnt things before and tasted it and it tastes like disgusting burnt flavor. Also carcinogens much?!?
When are you going to invite some women chefs?
This is a perfect example of people who think you can 'plate' your way into good cuisine. Don't be fooled people, if any of what you just watched was actually delicious, they would already be recipes. This is sub optimal and barely edible being passed off as creative for the gullible.
I really miss the old old content. worth watching. love you grant but bring back the crew.
2 Jeff Nelson videos in a row that are basically the same video except different music? WTF Chefsteps.
Is this an ad for an upcoming series of videos? or is this literally it? I subscribed to you guys for recopies and interesting innovations in cooking.
Why has Zorg from the Fifth Element taken over Chef Steps?
I think people are a bit too automatically triggered when they see "sous vide" or "joule". This video wasn't really even about the cooking method. But more so to give you some guidelines of how to balance your meal. Also, I think it is clear at this point what chefsteps is, whether you like it or not. If you're still watching this hoping that things will change....well good luck to you I guess.
i'm sitting here eating ice cream!
Honestly eating like this is so easy. I've been cooking almost every meal for 2 years now, cut back my eating out to maybe 3 or 4 times a month. One day I'll get a Joule (or maybe the Monoprice Strata for less ;))
Secrets to eating well:
Buy Joule.
Eat well.
This was more advertisement for Joule and Zwilling than real (new) information for us.
Waste of time to watch it.
miss the times when chefsteps was about different types of cooking. like the ratatouille, wall of fire, deep fryer frenzy, etc. those were the good vids!!
how is this on 480 it's been up for over 2 hours
Where are the chefs of chefsteps? We haven't seen chefs in almost a year. Bring them back!
upload some healthy delicious meal recipe please I NEED DAT
wasn't your last video this exact same thing?
Chefsteps used to have cool recipes but now it's all a shitty ad waste of time seeing this pop up in the feed, unsubbed as well.
Watched like a million of this channel's vids and accidentally called my friend Julie, Joule.
What happened to quality? :/
Like any great band doing something else, you  should change name... you ruined the media you created a while ago selling your white stick and now you are just waisting our time with useless images.

Plz dont insult the great work you use to do any longer, just stop uploading.
Reupload?
no sauce?
Dude, this guy was at pikes place the other day. Seriously a Bamf. good stuff!
Bring old ChefSteps back please :(
Goodbye ChefSteps. We've grown apart.
gona have to give meal prepping a try :D
Can you make narutos ramen???
If the next video mentions Joule in any way, I'm unsubbing. This used to be a great channel, but I'm sad every time I watch a new video and compare it to the greatness of past pre-Joule content.
Good presentation, but they are too clean to taste good.
Guys, Joule is great and all, and I understand your need for advertisement. But you do realize that you have 650.000 subs, where a big chunk of those are outside of the US, right? You're advertising a product to someone who can't even buy your product, while you basically ruin your content. I used to zealously follow your channel back when it was actually about kitchen techniques presented in a fun and beautiful environment, I don't bother watching anymore because you're almost exclusively pointing towards sous vide cooking with an apparatus not even available to me. There's no contact, no 'fun' moments with the cooking crew. 

Where are you guys even at?
Eating too much grilled food is not good for your stomach. It’s harder to digest
um im early or the video is 480 max ?
This channel is officially dead. I'm unsubscribing.
This is not the type of content I want from ChefSteps.
what is this ?? from chef steps ?? Please
I was fine with this video until at 0:42 I found out it's another Joule advertisement
We get it, use Joule for everything. Not everything has be be another Joule ad, it's kinda ruined content on this channel for me.
Fill a heavy based pan with water, place your joule in the water and heat to temperature required using the joule app. The take your other joule and place in a zip lock bag with olive oil and rosemary and a pinch of salt, cook your joule using joule for around one hour, serve on a plate of shredded joule with purée joule and serve. #thenextlevel
Do y'all not talk anymore? I love the music and I love reading but I come to YouTube to listen. That combined with every video using sous vide has lead to me unsubscribing. I'm sorry.
Nice video, but god I hate that guys hair.
If i cook more than one steak how will this effect my cook time?
oh great, another joule ad. thanks
I've been subbed since fizzy fruit, but this is where I get off. You guys are using a fanbase that loved you guys for the great and cool things you can do with food, using them to shamelessly get free advertisement. I kept hoping you guys would get the message that this isn't what people want, but I see that you are going to continue going downhill.
I'm really interested in healthy eating, but I don't believe that eating meat in every meal is sustainable. I have a vegetarian every-other-day rule. Keeping calories down and having a satisfactory vegetarian meal: this is the real challenge.
please don't have this guy on your channel ever again. I give you yellow card this time
Learn how to destroy a channel...
I like it
food porn with bad actor
cute
oh great another Joule.
pfft
His hairstyle is a joke.
I subbed when the content was actually good. Now they barely do a recipe a month :( unsubscibed
This is actually not a very healthy diet. Complex carbs are not good for you, they give you energy but so does a pot of coffee, and we don't say drink lots of coffee every day. That energy is short lived though. Actual, non bias nutritional research shower that low carb high fat lowers your chances of heart disease, and the fat will give you sustained energy. Quaker Oats, Kellogg, and several other large processed food manufacturer have pushed this idea that carbs are good and fat is bad to sell us there products. I'm not saying this guy is in on it, he is probably just promoting what he has been tought.
This is not healthy. Too many proteins.
This is getting ridiculous. Unsubscribed
I really liked this video, the weight press at the end was  the perfect touch
Just when you thought Chefsteps couldn't get any douchier...
(Interestingly, they are probably more concerned that I didn't capitalize the "S" in their name more than pointing out that their content is now just a series of advertisements.  Got to keep that brand on target, guys!)
Guilt free? Not for the animals.
Go vegan! :D
The recipes ChefSteps are tasty and delicious, but they aren't healthy for the most part, including this one...
Just be honest...
I eat local produce and avoid MSG! 👨‍🍳👍😊
ChefSteps has gone from measuring liquids in grams to using the good ol' fist method
instructions unclear. almost drowned in joule water.
A thumbnail sized fat? So like one nibble of avocado, two almonds, or an eighth of an egg?
Love this, you've made cooking look so fun thank you, i can't wait to start cooking now.
Remember to make sure you sous vide your meat with Joule so that you can ruin it later in the microwave.
Yesterday I watched ChefSteps video about Peking Duck. Now this...
I do miss the pre-Joule ChefSteps...
I'd do batches of meal prep if Grant high-fived me every time.
I sous vide my chicken, throw it in the fridge, and then warm it up in the microwave, and it is so awesome!  Still so incredibly juicy and flavorful.

However, I've never had success with the 5-6 meals a day and low fat diet.  Now I'm on the Keto diet and have happily lost 8% body fat over the past 3 months, and I love what I eat, never feel hungry, and never feel like I'm missing out on anything.

That's just been my experience, and I wish all the success in the world to those who are achieving goals with the low fat plans.

Keep up the fun videos!
In the words of Charles Barkley:
Trrbl. Just Trrbl.
The sparing of fats - I've read a lot on how we had the wool pulled over our eyes regarding fats. To the point where they added sugar to everything - and I am almost at the point where I consider processed sugar as a toxin.
everyone's comments about the microwave - just blanch your veg and eat the food cold or at room temp. Or eat the veg raw. 

also i feel weird about hot avocado or hot nuts anyway
when are you going to ship joule internationally i want it so bad (i live in iceland)
i like his happy face
Can anyone tell me more info on 140F temp and times for cooking  multiple proteins together in's separate bags  not sure about circulation and pasteurization. I've been using 140 for 2 hours.
Wow, this is disappointing. I generally don't mind all the joule advertisement at all, but this is just horrible.
If only Joule was available in the UK :/
yessssssss
Meal prepping hipster chefs? 
Seems legit.
FINALLY SOMETHING I WAITED FOR 2 YEARS
any chance of measurements or recipes - these look yummy. I currently batch freeze meals
Honestly I'm just here for the food visuals
great stuff, i like how ur featuring the greatest hits of local people in seattle.
Meal prep on ChefSteps?!? There is a god!
nice! I like that you guys are showing meal preppers some love
from which band is the Song in the backround? pls
Why have I never thought of batch prepping my proteins using joule?! Implementing this asap. Thanks for the time saver I feel so silly!
garbage, taco everything
very rare content
nice work guys
release joule in canada! i would buy it in a heartbeat
small video but best of !
more meal ideas like this please!
腹減ったーーー
How long does the the meat stay in the bath at 140? 1 hour?
When can Web get joule at Europe. ??
grant is such a daddy
The editing cuts are so fast it's impossible to read the text and watch what's going on at the same time.
Right on guys!
the gaaaaains
How long do u cook all that meat in one pot at 140?
I'm really sad at where this channel has headed,  Just pushing a product, rarely any uploads.  I used to get ideas and inspiration from ChefSteps now it is just plain depressing.
I miss when ChefSteps' whole channel didn't push the Joule
Should cook the beef rare, because when you microwave it, it'll be cooked further
I have been waiting for this for a long time. Awesome video guys. But if the temperature is the same, then what's the time for each protein?
I'm not comfortable reheating in plastic in a microwave. What are my options?
So healthy meals doesnt include seasoning?
mmmm I love the taste of BPA
Awsome idea!
Is it just me, or do people think healthy food has to be bland? My Asian sensibilities bemoan the sheer lack of spices in this vid
this chanel became just 100% jule commercial
More of meal preps please! I've been looking for a simple way to go about it and this helped so much!
what about pasta and rice?
My meal preps make me want to die
Great idea.
Cook in plastic bag then microwave in plastic container.   All the 30 second push-up intervals won't cure your gynecomastia.
He is Tim Curry when he laughs
What's the point of sous viding the protein if its going to get nuked in the microwave anyway?
I'm appreciative that ChefSteps went from cooking channel to commercial to cooking channel again. ( everyone should own a Joule by now! )
Eat 5/6 times a day ? huh never heard of that, is it because of the small portions ?
What if I have tiny girl hands?
Pretty sure that chunk of avocado is gonna be gross lookin in a couple of hours -- so this might be ok if you're cooking a staff meal for a few hours from now, but if you're cooking wednesday supper for yourself on sunday, this is NOT gonna work!!!
Lol the moment I read along (cook with joule) I stop watching
a steak or chicken can be safely stored in the fridge for up to a week and does not spoil?
This looks... bad
What happens if i Joule myself
For a day ?
Well that dude has the shittest haircut of 2017. SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!
Don't believe for a second, I didn't catch that, you animals. Push those contains to the back of the fridge. I abhor a half-filled fridge because someone was too lazy to organize their bulk cooking.
I cringe when I see the phrase "complex carbs" still being used by fitness gurus to refer to things like choosing sweet potatoes and brown rice instead of regular potatoes or white rice to get "sustained energy." The actual distinction that the term refers to in nutrition science is whether a carbohydrate is in the form of a starch or a sugar, and it's obvious beyond stating that healthy meal prep doesn't involve a pile of table sugar or a twinkie to meet ones target carb intake. As for sweet potatoes vs regular, or brown vs white rice, The enzymes our body uses to break starches down into sugars are incredibly efficient, and they don't care much at all how complex the chains of glucose molecules are making up a starch. They pretty much obliterate the bonds in all starches and break them down into simple glucose within minutes. 

It's not the "complexity" of the starch that slows down digestion, it's the presence of a fibrous flesh or fibrous hull/shell around the starch that acts as a physical impediment to digestion. But even then, whole grains vs polished grains have only a 10-20% lower glycemic index; the same is true for sweet potatoes vs regular potatoes. And if you're eating either one alongside any significant amount of protein or fat, the difference narrows even further. To say that that "complex carbs" like sweet potatoes (etc) give you "sustained energy" compared to "simple starches" like white potatoes (etc) is like saying that starch (a) enters into the bloodstream over a period of 100 minutes, while starch (b) enters into the bloodstream over a period of a  110 minutes! 

Carbohydrates do not give you "sustained energy" between meals, your stored liver glycogen does. Both "complex carbs" like what we see in the above video, and the "simple starches" that we would probably enjoy eating more than them, both do the same thing in the body with only a marginal difference in speed. They both digest into simple glucose, fairly quickly, and then enter the bloodstream, fairly quickly, and if you don't happen to be doing intense exercise during that small timeframe, insulin either shuttles them into the liver and muscle cells (if there's spare capacity) where they are stored as glycogen, or shuttles them into your fat cells. Pick your sources of carbohydrate based on nutrient density, nutritional quality, and taste preference, not on whether they are "complex" or not. And if you're trying to lose weight, decide on your  of starches based on at least a rough estimate of how glycogen depleted you are when you're about to eat (i.e. have you worked out seriously in the last 48 hours, has it been a few meals since you had a significant portion of carbohydrates,) instead of an arbitrary and fixed portion of your plate. 

If you're not working out hard every day and depleting a significant amount of muscle glycogen, then any starches or glucose that you're taking in can only be used to top off your liver glycogen (which maxes out at about 70 grams) before they will be pushed into your fat cells. 70 grams of carbs is not much at all. After you factor in the amount of carbs from a healthy serving of vegetables at every meal (about 20-25g for the whole day) we're talking ONE single measured cup of mashed sweet potato, or quinoa, or brown rice--and you've completely fulfilled your "need" for carbohydrate for the day if you're not refueling from a workout. And you really don't even "need" those 70 grams; dipping into ketosis and letting your body burn additional fat throughout the day in order to meet its resting energy requirement on non-refuel days even better for you. Filling 1/4th of your plate with carbohydrate at every meal, every day, without adjusting for your activity level, is a guaranteed way to gain fat mass that will just take additional work in the gym to burn off. If you're not recovering from a serious workout and have no real need to replenish muscle glycogen, you're better off replacing the carbs with additional veggies and and a little more healthy fat.
and cook with Joule
. . . thumbs down
Why so afraid of fat? It's not actually bad for you.
What is this fitness food without any kind of porridge or cereal?
Where is Rice, Oatmeal, Buckwheat. You can't get all the aminos form simple potato, and you need a hell amount of vegetables to cover your day portion.
I honestly rather just die from an unhealthy diet
Dietitians are the trainers in the kitchen... he's just the cross-fitter of nutrition advice. And legally he cant give you meal plans.
A single pork chop has about 30g of fat. A "thumbnail" of almonds has about 1/2g.

I'd somewhat forgive the boring food if this guy actually understood nutrition.
Do they last for a week?Their taste gets worse over two days.
That food looks so boring. no offence, but I prefer a lunch thats more than just an efficient way to get the required calories.
The only meal prep video you ever need
love the idea, but concerned about microwaved food being bad for our health. what's @chefstep opinion about this?
DONT WICROWAVE PLASTIC that food is in contact with. Get a glass set of to go containers and keep a silicone pad to place on top.
they've officially run out of ideas
Dodgy haircut, can't trust the guy
Why don't you guys ever add any additional spices to the vegetables and protein apart from herbs? Is it unhealthy?
All those videos are useless. I miss the old Chefsteps from a couple years ago, was actually really informative and useful material for professional chefs... Their videos now are good for my grand mom...
nah... give me chefsteps on chefsteps! if i want healthtipps, i go look 4it...
Who has $500 for a Joule??
microwave plastic wtf
We call it the brat hot tub here in Wisconsin, you forgot to finish them on he grill, shame!!
Gawd, I love that this is a cooking channel again. Don't get me wrong, I bought a Joule, and love those videos too. I like how succinct these cooking videos are.
It's not a bratwurst then...
Those deserve to be grilled.
Hey Grant's back, finally. Love that guy!
cracking a cold one open with the boys
I'd have to double the beer bath and reserve half for my beer and onion reduction and I agree I like to finish mine on the grill for crunch but having a reserved bath for people to pull from at their leisure is nice!
also poke a few holes in the brat for the beer to penetrate deeper into the meat ;)
'Member when they let Grant cook on this channel? 
I miss those days :(
I hope you guys start uploading more often again! It doesn't even have to be super high-tech, just some fun recipes you like to make would be awesome! Or maybe another video like the waffle iron frenzy? I need my weekly dose of ChefSteps!
Whew, you guys are back. Missed these videos, good to see your mustache again Grant.
When are you doing a review of the Control Freak induction hob? That thing seems amazing!

p.s.: I know that's not the one featured here, but still, I'd love ChefSteps' take on it.
What is the name of the temp controlled induction hob right there? and where can I get that?
wait wait, the sausage is not cooked in sous vide with the beer by using joule? wow this surprise me
He's a skinny and moustachy Danilo Gallinari!!
Grill them first at super high temperature a few minutes per side, they won't cook all the way through but they'll get a little color at least.
What is brand/model is that portable induction you're using?
Sorry. No unami, no flavor.
Can you make some vegan/vegetarian recipes?
would the beer destroy my sous vide
could never eat a boiled sausage, has to be grilled or oven cooked
could I use joule?
Is it alright if I use joule for liquids that aren't water, like beer? I wouldn't add the spices because, duh, but I am curious.
So glad the old ChefSteps is back
Im genuinely surprised they weren't sou vide'd
I thought they would use JOULE for the beer bath!
theire back!!!!
Glad you are back!
Needs more transglutaminase
So when u can actually utalize a sous vide in a good way for a stable temp, you dont even mention it?
This channel without Joule is the wurst
Metric System?
More sausage. Please and thank you.
But I'm not old enough to drink :(
Grant. This is a massive failure... massive, massive, massive fail. 

Come to Wisconsin. We will show you how to do the brat hot tub right.
Next: steamed roastbeef
You guys should colab with Gordon Ramsay. That'd be entertaining and you'd probably cool up some wicked tasty food
Whooooooooooooo
First comment
they will probably take this video down, due to the lack of sous vide
Do you have any idea the hassle I've had to go through to use Sous Vide, chef steps inspired, cooking in the UK? And now this?? Is this a joke?
Um, only 60 year old men with a really low budget drink Raineer beer. That stuff is nasty.
can you guys please make an apple strudel like from the movie inglorious basterds
Like this
calling them brats when they are poached is so disturbing for germans like me.
where is lord gaben?
Next up: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!
Beer advert
couldn't you just do this with joule
@1:17 did that blonde dude just put beer on his sausage??
Well... sausages are much better when baked in beer.
Ollies, dude.
1:16 guy just pouring beer straight in his hotdog.
way to cut off grant's head, camera man
Inject the brats with beer and then grill them. They stay moist and has that good smokey flavor. Do a quick sear then move them to indirect to stay warm.
he makes noise before he even chew the dog
Where is Joule while all this is happening?
I tried to drink beer from the beer bath, I threw up inside the pot.
Can I replace the beer with broth ?
Kids, if he offers you his sausage at the park don't take it
can i get drunk by eating that sausages?
Mmmmmm, love me some boiled sausages
wtf
WHERE. IS. THE. JOULE.
Wait, no joule to heat the beer bath? this is a fake video guys!
Like most ChefSteps videos, stolen right from Kenji Lopez Alt's Channel.
what a waste of beer
Sorry guys, Bratwurst means fried sausage. Fried. NOT cooked!
terrible short video.
Cool! Like to you!
sorry but these look utterly disgusting
Did that one hipster pour beer on his braut?
But they're gonna have soggy skin?
No point sous vide how would the beer flavour get in the snags. Could you brown them on the bbq after poaching them?
What can you substitute the beer for? Beer is disgusting.
This guy is way too excited about "sloppy sausages" and "juicy sausage"... Also, when did the 70's stache gain popularity again? Dude looks like a pedophile that should be riding in a white van somewhere lulz...
This music really suits the video. Makes me want to groove. Hahahaha
I like this guy
More videos similar to this. Less Joule. Keep it up.
They say everyone likes sausage but no one wants to see it get made, I disagree, I did like seeing this sausage get made.
The last sentence though ... hahaha
That guy looks like he was born to make sausage
"I say keep it" that man is a genius
I wish I loved anything as much as this guy loves his job
sehr gut gemacht Uli!
That guy is cool
One thing i was taught is to fry a small portion of the meat/spices mixture in a pan before filling the casing. This way you can taste your mixture to make final adjustments.
Can you guys make a video on boudin sausages next time? That would great if you can find a chef that specializes in that within the Seattle area!
This guy is a sausage artist, what a talent to watch.
Awesome episode.
Auf geht's, jetzt wird Wurscht gemacht!! :'D
It sounds crazy and I know that some people in the comment section will hate this, but cooking Bratwurst sous vide is pretty cool! You can only use high quality obviously.. 63° 90minutes and then blowtorching. It's crazy good.
this guy seems so happy doing what he does! keep it up!
I wish they would've sous vide'd the sausage, just to make the haters salty 😂
so could sausage be done sous vide? or does it just sit in grease.? what temp do you get it 160?
Good that at least others still have ideas apart from Steak with Joule!
Great video concept! Keep it coming guys loved it. Plus that guy seems and sounds like the character "Braum" from League of Legends :DD
2:39 literally how you insert a condom😂😂😂😂
MUSIC: Moving On by Soul City. You're welcome.
Don't make jokes about this video, that's the wurst thing you can do.
How can you not like this video? Two thumbs up from me.
1:27 is when I knew for sure I liked this guy.
Great vid!
25% - 30% lean? Don't you mean 70% - 75% lean?
Good job
best video yall have ever posted =]
The Man is full of joyfulness! It was fun watching it
i want that man as a regular on ChefSteps instead of submerging good into water-bath
WOW! YUM!  Off to order the sausage attachment....
Happy guy, I like him
the man is so jolly
In Germany sausage violates shira law!
seriously though uli is a Damn genius.
Hahah... keep those cheap cuts, amen!
LOVE it ! thank you chef!
More this, less Joule.
YES! They're coming back!
What is the song's name?
And ChefSteps hide the Joules before this guy comes-
I am.willing to work with this uncle. Such happy go lucky man
Das ist gut
what a great video!!!
Perfect, good luck!
Can you cure those? How long would it take?
Uli is awesome!
Next, authentic bratwurst that you buy at the schnillimbisses.
Wow. Now I want to see how they make beer sausage. :D
u mog strica osam kobasica, sedam przi osmu strina drzi
He's so happy
Id love to see you guys do a version of spam or ham using jule
And that's it. 4:36, he's the man.
Yummyyyy  ❤❤❤
Now this guys is a butcher I can trust.
seems like hilarious guy who loves exactly what he is doing for living
Im in love .only thing i would like for you to do is a tutorial with turkey sausage were i live we have alot of seven day adventist around they would prefer turkey or chicken i dont see much videos with either
Isn't the best way to cook sausages using the sous vide method?
what is this song!!!!!
Yay new videos!! :) can't wait to try this!
I was going along with it when it was just the Kitchenaid and the grinder attachment. Then you lost me with that hand crank stuffer.
I need this in my life!
Cool tune! By who?
25%-30% lean? That's has to be a mistake...
I would love to make my own sausages by it requires too many specialised equipment
YES
Wow it's not sousvide
I would do this but with chicken thighs.
and not a water bath in sight BRAVO!
he is god...
welcome back
Great fun video!
A VIDEO WITHOUT JOULE
look at his fingers thougn. meat preparation is a killer.
Awesome music
how to cure that ?
Auf geht's, jetzt wird Wurscht gemacht!
I'm somewhat disappointed there isn't a Joule in this video. You guys pushed that sous vide garbage into our faces so aggressively in the past that it made me not watch anything you guys put out in the past few months. It's like a breath of fresh air with the absence of Joule in this video. Keep it up!
Germany ftw!!! und ja... ich komm aus deutschland :D
Good german guy
I wish it had subtitles... I am hard of hearing, and while the existing text is good, I can't make out the comments. :(
Who is the musician for the music?
That is one very German man
must admit, felt the need to funk around the house with this music turned up.
And now sous vide this sausage ....
I WANNA DISTRIBUTE MY SAUSAGE ALL OVER THE WORLD TOO!!!
TIL my brat is average.
WHAT. A. BOSS.
hello my question to you is do you think octopus can be grounded and made into a sausage. I know the texture is a bit tough but I'm just trying to be creative and if it can be done what kind of seasonings would you use
this video is the würst!
Can't believe they didn't cook it in Joule
What grinder attachment for the mixer is that?
Uhhhhh where's the sous vide
Why nit sous vide the sausage?!?!
so a spoon of forearm hair per lb of pork?
And then again at 2:08.
I would love to hear this guy talking and tell us his story rathen than full of music video, this guy seems pretty chill.
As a German who likes making and eating sausages, I approve.
Very good video!
Blowing in the casings, shaving the hair off his arm? How dirty
it was hard to read the white text during the video
I wanna eat my sausage
1:33 reggie miller more brown hairs than chewbacca
If anyone is reading this, I really need to know this song's name. Have a good day.
Sorry.  I eat it.  But this was disgusting.
"Pork shoulder 25%-30% lean" shouldn't that be 70%-75% lean? Wouldn't 25-30% lean mean that the meat is mostly fat?
Let me guess.... You sous vide the sausage. 
can you make a video how to make indonesian rendang with your way????
ChefSteps has taken a    s t e p    in the right direction
Damn music ruined it.
hygienische Arbeit ist aber etwas ganz anderes
Introducing our new fragrance... Sausage by Uli
They are back!
oops, that pour. looks like Uli has been away from home a little too long.
This man is my new hero
I do a spicy Italian sausage with dried cranberries.  it's amazing
That guy looks like he's hilarious
either eat them in 4-5 days, or you can also freeze them
Pork, Apple sausages & beer - yummy
👍 but with all HALAL ingredients
I'm familiar with Uli's (I live in Seattle), but I just found out this is now one of my wishlist "I want to drink a beer with this dude".. there are a few but he's waaay up there now after seeing this!
I want to see 400 more videos from this guy
Save some for me! 👨‍🍳👍😊
I love these segments!
grilled sausage washed down with german beer? where do i sign.
1
first
WHo else saw the gaben video from a few days ago?(now deleted)
WANT.
Finally
i love this video so much
Great, channel isn't dead! And good video. I want to experiment with sausages, but honestly, I'm a bit squeamish about the casings. Also, no pigs allowed. What can I use?
1:41 pretty sure this isn't f word cameraman
No forceful ''Joule'' advertising? Well i'll be damned.
teach that man to pour a beer!
german sausages are the wurst
Unsub!!!!
Probably the worst chefsteps vid
German guy is legit though; hes probably the favorite uncle of many nephews
There is one sausage country in the world and its Poland.
german sausages are bad...only polish kiełbasa :)
