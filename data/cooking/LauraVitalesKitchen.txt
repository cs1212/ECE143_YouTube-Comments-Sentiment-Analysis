What the heck YUM!! I truly think I’d like this even better than an actual cordon bleu!
I love making bbq pulled chicken sandwiches, then using the leftovers to make quesadillas with green chili. So freakin good.
I have all these ingredients in my fridge soo I know what I am making for lunch 👏👏
Making this for lunch! Its minimal ingredients that I already have 😼
That looks delicious I will have to try this!
OM-GOODNESS!!!  Your mouth must be permanently void of hotness.  I just saw you eat that quesadillas piping hot.  Does your mouth hurt?  Love you recipes.  Always a go to!
So excited to watch this when I get home, still in the mid of work atm🤗
Thank you for this quick, easy delish recipe!
Always good to spend time with you, Laura! Hope all your family is well!
Greetings from London!
That looks delicious!  I hope you had a wonderful Mother's day.
You’re a hoot!  And I love your recipes. 👍

I love her channel but Laura LAURA get BETTER lighting.
I missed watching your videos. Started watching you back in 2012.
love this - Laura can you pleeeeeeeeeease make either LARD bread or prosciutto bread!
I been watching you for almost 4 years and I was just thinking how crazy that is keep up the great work.
Looks so good! Can't wait to try it. I have a small request...could you make stracciatella? Thank you.
Even easier: take some salami (or chorizo), cheese to your flavor, oregano. And there you go :-)
Laura you should do a video of the purées you would make for Mia. Baby recipes please
Looks amazing! Can you show us how to make confetti pancakes? :)

instead of making a Quesadilla, I would make a savory crepe, please share recipe for Savory crepe
Haven’t watched yet but I already know it’ll be added to my favorite meal list! I absolutely love your videos, Laura!!
Sometimes I like to put ham on my face and take a warm bubble bath with olive oil. The temperature has to be just below boiling and then I cry. It's also called Chicken Cordon Bleu.
Can you please make chicken cheese panini with normal bread
Your right easy yummy meal for the kiddos. Me as well   Lol
I'm definitely going to give these a try, they look delicious.
I'd love to try this! Is there something I could swap for the mustard?
She said "Not Todayy" 😭😭❤️❤️
YUM! What a great idea! Thanks Laura!
I have all the ingredients.  Okay lunch and dinner.
Looks good Laura. Can you please show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps
This is quesadilla her way because a quesadilla does not bring ham. But it's ok something different very different.😉😉
She is georgeous, isnt she? In Canada its easier to find half pound nuggets in your garden than a beautiful lady like her which can cook. (And loves to cook).
That looks soooo good. I am so hungry right now lmao
I think this is my favourite video from you just because of your commentary
U forgot to write with episode this is like which number of a recipe this is
Looks great!  Can make a Cuban too!  Or a Philly!
I am SO making this!!!!😋 xxx
I appreciate you mentioning to switch spoons! It's not common knowledge and it's such an important habit to form. I would recommend a non porous utensil in addition to your excellent recommendation. 👍
But where's baby Mia ??? 💓
6:15   :-)))

You’re killing me Laura. That looks so good!!!
I would love to make these.  So delicious looking.  🍓
omg this is so weird i’ve been looking for a good strawberry shortcake recipe for the past few days and then yOU POST THIS what a coincidence
In my family we use pound cake not biscuits
ahahaha you killed me! "butt sized"!
I felt that butt size remark. Because me too lmao
Laura you are hilarious! I love it. I have been looking for an easy classic recipe like this one. Thank you for all that you do and Happy Mother's Day!
Laura “Marie Kondo’doughed” that biscuit rolling! LOL !
I love your energy in this! Can’t wait to try this😋😋😋😋
Omg, you crack me up 😂 
Love watching you and the recipes!
Yaaaaas!!! Making this tomorrow for Mother’s Day
The shortcakes are amazing but i must say i really love your outfit and makeup in this video, Laura!! It compliments you so well! It looks so comfortable but yet such a great look!! 😍😍
You should have an ASMR channel where you just eat this. :)
Hi Laura, happy mother’s day, with your beautiful little Mia !
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
Happy Mother’s Day Laura , you’re the best . Thank you for all the recipes ❤️
Beautiful!! Thanks for Sharing,.And Happy Mothers Day!! Blessings!
Happy Mother's Day Laura!😘❤💐🌹
Great recipe as always and gorgeous make-up look.
Laura, I love how much you don’t care how you eat on camera. You are always yourself!! 💕☺️
I wouldn’t cut them round. I would just cut them square and maximize the yield from the get-go instead of rolling the scraps together again and risk having flat biscuits at the end. I guess for esthetics round looks cuter, but it’s not necessary! 🍓
is making sweets easier than actual cooking, or its just me .
I'd still smash




The like button of course
Adorei esse receita obrigada 🙏🏻😘
I swear, if you told me paper sprinkled with sugar was delicious, I'd totally devour it & love it! So good!!
I cant help it, but to notice how amazing your hair and makeup look. So simple yet so pretty 😍 your blusher is on point
Great recipe as always! I was hoping Mia would be there as it's Mother's day tomorrow.
I love watching this series.
This definitely has the WOW factor! Thanks Laura.
Are you pregnant? I don’t know why I have feeling that you are 🙄.. love you Laura 😍❤️
Your restaurant would be called “Momma Mia’s Cafe” with the gorgeous biscuits!

Happy Mother's day, love your show!
We Love Laura!  Love her Recipes...
Ciao cara Laura, sei una persona splendida e dolcissima...your recipes are wonderful as are your presentations--thank you; also I wish to say how refreshing it is that you always keep your beautiful hair tied back while sharing your recipes and no rings on your fingers...nothing more unappetizing than having ones hair streaming down over the food and ringed fingers working the ingredients...
ancora grazie, Laura....Elizabeth
I wish I had a kitchen like yours...
Looks great, Happy Mothers day to all. Ty, Laura have a blessed day.🙏❤
I love your enthusiasm for food Laura, some of your quotes from this episode were hilarious. I cant wait to make this one.

Very good recipes
Shmoosh it lol looks lovely.
Love your channel
Here in Norway it's sometimes impossible to get everything I need for a resipe. But this one will be easy to make. But I will need to my own buttermilk. Thank you Laura! Love your channel. Enjoy your mothers day tomorrow. Hugs from Norwa.
Looks delicious
I love you laura
THATS NOT BUTTERMILK!! Vinegar in milk is not buttermilk. Its actually cultured milk. Its actually closer to yogurt or sour cream.
I live in india. N most of the times dont have the ingredients handy. So i dont really come here to follow the recipes (which i would love to). I come here for this sweet lady.. Love u laura 💕 ur such a mood!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This lady is beautiful and her food looks bomb but I can't help and notice that she sounds like someone is pinching her nose when she talks.
Non c e butter milk in italia! 😭
Yum, yum, yum!  I've never had strawberry shortcake on biscuits before!  Going to try this for Father's Day, thank you!!!
Yummm
It made me so happy watching this♡♡♡♡
Ooo I love this!
Yummy 😋 😍
Fantastic Recipe 👩🏻‍🍳  yum yum yummy!!!   Happy Mother’s Day 🌷
looks  great
For Mother's Day I either make strawberry shortcake or strawberry shortcake  cake 🍓🍦🍰
哈哈
Watching your videos is like you have a long-time friend gossiping with you. The issue is you may freak out if I ever find you on the street, a crazy stranger may come up to you and hug you as if she knew you her whole life lol
These look amazing right on time for Mother’s Day . My signature dish for Mother’s Day is a strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting... it’s out of this world :)
I.have.to.make.this!
An inspiring lady who makes a recipe so simple and easy to follow. How can you make Rasberry shortcake without having to have more sourness? Thank you
What is a butter milk and where to buy it in England?
Why did you stop numbering your videos? Please dont do that.. helps with the search and fun to see how far you have come..
That looks so very yummy.  Love strawberry shortcake.
That's is so delicious Laura I'am getting so hungry
TIP: When making your own buttermilk (I can't ever seem to find it in the UK), pop the milk in the microwave for 20 seconds before adding the lemon juice. Thanks, Mary Berry.
Dying at “butt-size” biscuits 😂😂
Love this recipe!  Off topic, but do you exercise at home or a gym.  You look great!
Points for the Owen Wilson reference.
I'm muslim, i'm fasting right now and still got 6+ hours to go before break (the fast) time. It is probably the worst decision to watch this video right now, but i'm loving every minutes of it. Thanks Laura !
1352
This looks great! Deffffff going to try it!
I feel like it needs Nutella
i LP
Cousin Laura said that’s a mountain of love!!! She’s right
Ugh 😩 it looks so delicious i wish i could take a bite
LOVE your make up!
love this  yum yum
HAHA oh my gosh "bite sized" ahhhh
The little song when she was opening the biscuits
awesomely yummiliciously lookiliously great👍😊
Very cool!
Just tested a recipe for a modern strawberry shortcake, too! I honestly couldn’t even wait to put it all together, I broke the biscuits apart with my hand, dipped them in the whipped cream and grabbed a couple macerated strawberries with my spoon and ate it like that lol. Also, i loved that picture with Mia that you posted on your ig eating this! My daughter just turned 1 but I can’t wait for her to be able to come into my videos and eat this stuff with me!
Looks great, i am diabetic so a no go for me, but maybe for my wife, maybe Sunday for mothers day
If I'd cook and bake all these yummies that you do, I'd eat triple the amount than normal. I'm surprised how skinny you are Laura. You probably just eat the bite or two you show us. Then diet n workout. I'd be pigging aeay. 😂😁😜
Bit too messy for my taste. Too hard to press the spoon into the pastry to get a nice neat spoonful. Prefer actual strawberry shortCAKE, not biscuits.
Wow, is she buzzed?
Omg this looks so deliciously healthy. I need to start dieting again 🤗
Thanks for doing something Greek. Looks delicious. Love from Greece.
Love you laura...could you share some tasty low carb meals and snacks
It looks delicious Laura, will try them for for sure😍
Do you have a recipe for the Tzatiki?
I was actually craving Greek so this is PERFECT! ❤️
Gonna try this out this weekend!


Thanks Laura! Always love your recipes~ ❤️
WOWWW this looks so good!! You’re such an inspiration to us newbies. I’ve started a new cooking channel with fast easy recipes would love some support!
What’s up with the camera angles? Laura is beautiful, but let’s stay focused on the food man!
You’re killing it with all the Mediterranean recipes!! Good stuff.
I love Greek flavors and this is perfect.  I like nice hot French fries dipped into the tzatziki.  I hope Mia likes it, by the way we want more Mia.
I would like to see Laura make "Mofongo", a Caribbean dish made with Plantains, salt pork, garlic and olive oil.
I'm sure she would find a clever and easy way to make it. It's delicious!!
My homegirl Laauuuurrraa!! At it again! Defiantly gonna try making this!
Greek approved :)
Laura - we need your take on a classic: the REUBEN SANDWICH !
Tiamo princess u always rock love u from pakistan

You're my inspiration love you and mia so much 💓💓💓
Laura, I actually made this tonight. I had everything at home. I "grilled "  it on my grill pan on the stove. It was tender, juicy and very flavorful!  Thank you.
This looks delicious. Do u have any burrito recipes for dinner?
I was literally just watching your videos from years ago and you didn’t age at all omg. You still are very pretty Laura! 💗
Hi again Laura!
Is the red wine vinegar a must,  or can I use the white wine vinegar,  or maybe even  apple or balsamic?
Oh hell yeah!! Looks amazing Laura!!
I recently subscribed to your channel and i love the content. Always looking forward to your videos. And have binge watched some. You are Nice cook. Keep them coming! Thank You for Sharing.

I’ve been making my own version and it was almost the exact same! Great minds think alike ❤️

I was just craving Greek !!
What a great idea! That chicken looks so juicy!
Your  a beautiful lady and I love your videos.
Looks amazing😍
Mmmm looks delicious 😋
That chicken looks super juicy!!!
Love this! I’m Arab and this is pretty much one of the ways my family makes kebabs on the grill! I love all those little sides too, that’s how we eat. Lots of pickles. Fresh veggies and GOT TO have good quality olive oil. It’s liquid gold. Ive always known this but whenever I see your videos like this, I realize even more how much Arabs and Italians have in common!
Laura hello 🥰🥰🥰🌹🌹🌹🌹💕💕💕
This looks so delish ... It actually would be perfect for me to take to work
Wow! That looks sooo good Laura. Have to give that a go😋
Wow! That looks like a great healthy meal! Thank you for sharing Laura 👌🏼❤️
Maybe ya can post more cookie recipes 😁
I love healthy food recipes! Please make more of them!
Very good video recrpt. Hello from my kitchen.❤👍👍👍👍👍
Hi gorgeous 💕

So, you made souvlaki.
Greece loves Laura 😀❤️
Hi Laura. The recipe looks yummy. Please show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps.
Amazing recipes like always
These type of videos are some of my favorite from you!
if the Greeks are marinating your chickens chances are the chickens wandered to far.
Oh my looks so good. My mouth is watering. I love Greek food!!,🥰
It tastes like a million and a half bucks that is a word lol I'm dying 🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
This looks delicious and easy! Def plan on making this!
Cousin Laura!!!! This a great summer platter!
To me, Greek chicken is the best tasting chicken ever. It has a distinctive remarkable flavor that’s hard to describe. But I never learned how to make it. Can’t wait to try this recipe and see how it comes out.
so when are we going to have a meet & greet? and by meet and greet i mean, food catered meetup by laura lol
Hummus recipe please!
看上去太美味啦！💕
That looks sooooo yummy! 🍽
Ciao Laura.. fai sempre bellissime Ricette   Brava👍uno  abbracio dal belgio

Wow amazing❤️😍
Wow greate
Amazing
Amazing
I love your videos!! And Greek food haha
Looks so good 👌
You’re great!🌞thanks!
I recently started making grilled chicken salads for my husband’s lunch for health reasons, and have been experimenting with different marinades and dry rubs.  I’m really looking forward to trying this recipe. 👍
Damn that looks good
Looks delicious and healthy 😋
We will bring the bottle of wine.....
I've never actually cooked with dill. I should really try it this weekend!
Everytime I watch people use the grater for garlic or onion I cringe thinking they are going to cut themselves. Anyone else do that?
Delicious!
😋😋😋👍👍👍
pause at 0:15 lol
Laura when you say you cooked it for 3-4 mins on each side you can’t be serious right?
Ugh this is so simple I’m so excited to try thissssss, I never would’ve thought to use this with shrimp!
Nice 👌 delicious
Looks good.
Actually...you can omit the red wine vin...if you marinate too long with the VIN, you'll see the chicken actually cook. Makes it too mushy. 
Sometimes I throw honey in that marinade.
This goes great with the oven brown taters Laura makes.
Have you ever been or seen industrial farmed chicken? You would never eat it again.
Hola Paola
awesome.. new ways to use up dill... i will try this with chicken and fish....
My grandmothers had a few of those stone grinders. I didn't believe my eyes when you picked that up. Not even my mother used them. Your family is lucky to have you. You said, '...really, really excellent quality extra virgin olive oil'. Any suggestion on what you use. Around LA I am seeing almost every type of extra virgin olive oil being mixed with other oils. They label it Extra Virgin Olive oil because it contains a little more then 50% extra virgin olive oil. I cant find any that just says cold pressed olive oil anymore. So any suggestions....please?
Yummy
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
El molcajete
Laura, what grater (size of holes) is that? Different from the fine one. I like that one better, longer grate.
Omg Laura! Your makeup looks gorgeous today!
Cool and it’s a low carb meal 💪
😍😍😍😍😍😍😗😗😗😗🍃🍂🌾🌼🌻🌺😜😜
That is not "dill weed" that you are grinding up in the mortar, it is dill seed.  "Just saying."
EXCELLENT work. 💯 🎯
Yum! That's the kind of pasta I would make, then stand next to the stove and eat it all out of the pan...lol! #nosharing 🥦
Who's here cuz there fasting?
just made this, put a ton of parmesan and even some cheddar on top and it was so fantastic. i love garlic so i left it in the pan to crisp up along with the pasta. i also added just a squeeze of lemon because i love the taste of lemon. fantastic taste, super simple recipe! ❤️
Hi Laura....love you and your channel.....please can you make stuff  eggplant.....I'm Neapolitan I love my eggplant 👍😝
Thanks for this recipe. We need an up to date vegetarian Lasagna recipe. X
It’s the simplest of recipe that are surprisingly very tasty! I can tell this pasta is delicious 😍😍😍
For-Fatty version = more butter and more cheese.  lol  Looks delish. ;) :D

Can you please make a pasta dish with saffron in it.
This looks really good! Will definitely give it a try. Your recipes are part of a household!  Thanks Laura!
One of my favorites that my mom would make! We skipped the broccoli a lot and just had fried macaroni 😉💕😉
Thank you Laura! My two favorite things! 💕
Made it for dinner just tonight and it is delicious! Best wishes from Germany! <3
Love this method. Awsome. Thanks. Can use for loads of stuff.
That looks so good! You look really pretty, Laura! 😘
I tried it and it's phenomenal! Grazie Laura
I'd watch your vids if you made playdoh pizzas.
Hi Laura how are you? The recipe looks good. Can you please show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? I have been waiting. You promised us in your bomboloni episode. Thank you heaps.
So good, my favorite cooking channel!!
Yummy yummy! Keep up the great work, Laura ❤
I'm so making this next weekend🤗
I love pasta and I love broccoli, such a wonderful combination! Will definitely try this way of cooking them! Thank you for sharing the recipe! Also, I love your passion for cooking!
This looks so good. I think I’ll make it for dinner.
You make me feel happy and inspire me!
Amazing thumbnail!!!
好棒呀，感觉好好吃呀！好喜欢💕
Looks amazing gonna try this for sure! Thanks Laura
This is a nice take on Pasta and Broccoli. A Neopolitan neighbor made this with ziti and broccoli but used a method I never encountered before. He cooked the pasta and broccoli in salted water with garlic but removed most of the water halfway through and boiled away the rest. This cooking process let the starch settle at the bottom of the pot to form a kind of sauce with the broken down garlic he added just a touch of olive oil and then plated with cheese on the side. The Ziti wasn't toasted or crunchy but this simple one-pot meal was amazing even without the added cheese. This dish really shows the genius of Italian home cooking with just a few quality ingredients and expert technique you can have great food.
You make awsome food keep up the good work
It looks Phenomenal 😍👌
Hey Laura, your new camera is awesome!!
I love when my pasta is crispy!!
perfect! my family love it
Wow interesting twist on one of my faves...I’ll have to try it. Thanks Laura
Wow awesome delicious crispy pasta with brocoli recipe

Hi I am Indian .. your all videos ❤👍
You edited a little differently 😏
So glad you’re redoing these recipes
Pasta is tasty and broccoli is healthy. What a super smart recipe. Love this.
Have a great weekend Laura!
I like this thumbnail 😏😏👌🏼
Something I wont be making.
This looks really good! I'll defenetely try this for me
Im making this tomorrow 🤤
Just cooked it, not bad :D
Ahhhhh I just made this!! It's amazing. Thank you! I watch your videos regularly!
Another great recipe quick & easy
Our dinner tomorrow 🌸
Totally making this and adding bacon to it!
Looks absolutely heavenly!
That was the perfect healthy pasta !
Hi Laura; recipe looks excellent  Yum
Im adding salt
This looks so good, but what do you have with it? Or do you just eat it alone?
Always the best!
It looks so easy and delicious! 💕
Looooooved this recipe
Sounds delicious what is your favorite food
Hi Laura, i make this and i put a little bit of ouzo (greek aromatic alchohol) and it gives such a lovely taste. Try it!
Your channel will always be my favorite 💞
Omg delicious
where your wine
I also added diced, baked turkey
I reccomment you use another oil(like sunflower oil for example) because olive oil is used better for salads. In very low temperature, olive oil turns it's good  properties, to bad in your stomach.
Can We use Conchiglie
I will cook this tomorrow!
can you use another type of pasta?   Elbow or penne or others
This looks really nice, could you make this with tenderstem broccoli or does it have to be florets cut up like that?

Looks good and healthy food!! I love it
Laura I love your recipies!!! Keep it up!
I have never heard of this, but boy we are making that Monday night.
Lol at Laura's face at 2:31
Question:  I tried making this last night.  Not sure why but the broc didn't 'melt' into the pasta the same way - I even cooked it longer. Why???  Also I find Parm too strong. Is there milder cheese that melts into a sauce the same way.  I can tell I would love this with a milder cheese.
Love the updated re-do videos
yummy
Yum!!!
Where's the parm? ;)
Hey Laura! I am definitely adding this to the Vitale meal rotation.
Che bellezza
Yummm
👍😊
Ohhhhhh I need this now!
Would frozen broccoli also work? Cause if so I already have the ingredients and can make it tonight!!
I super love her
That looks so delicious Laura
Deliziosa 😍
You look as delicious as your food
Not the best way to make pasta  and broccoli imo.  Crunchy pasta?

Hi Laura!!! Love you 💚
Anyone else mouth watering when she took a bite?
Hi Laura, that pasta and broccoli looks amazingly delicious! Thank you for sharing. 👍🏼
I've done this recipe today , but be careful guys if you are using like me frozen broccoli, you will have to cook them more than 2 minutes , I did it only 2 minutes and It doesn't turn out like her . Still a good recipe though
Burnt Brocolli: so youve eaten my stir-fry I see.....
😛😛😛😛😛😛😛
Oh my god! I want to marry youuuuuuuu!!!! You’re the BOMB.COM woman
Ciao sei originaria dell'Italia, di dove?Scommetto.....Puglia le orecchiette home made sono mooolto più buone.Dovresti scrivere in gr. se puoi le varie ricette.
Saluto dall 'Italia Puglia, pr di Brindisi
p.s.
Sciogli nell'olio qualche acciughina sott'olio, , con aglio poi aggiungi qualche oliva e mandorla senza pelle si cuoce un pochino e ci butti dentro l a pasta mescolare bene spolverata di pangrattato tostato in padella, spolverata di pepe (chi vuole peperoncino piccante) filo di olio e.v.o..
Io le faccio le orecchiette home made, con semola rimacinata e farina integrale, e con le cime di rapa.
Bye
Laura Vitale is probably the best kind of friend to have. She’s cheerful and will cook you dinner. Everything that comes out of her kitchen looks DELICIOUS! So Laura, if you’re reading this and looking for a gay BFF, I’m available!
Love your channel but when you stand in front of the hanging pots and pans. (1.35, 5.28) It looks like you have Mickey Mouse ears on. lol
Hi Laura. I'm fat because of you.
We have been eating a lot of great food,very italiana with lots of parmigiano,we are getting fat and it is your fault !
alltheWay Yummy Baby!
Drinking game: take a shot every time Laura says “it’s the best broccoli pasta”
did anyone else get scared when she added the pasta into the pan towards her and not away from her? she brave.
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
ÖÖÖ
Can someone explan why you don't chop the garlic for this recipe and are there other dished where choping would have a negative impact on the taste of the endresult?(i am 16 male and bloody new to the kitch so sorry in edvance if this questions comes up as tremendeously silly)

I understand why you said to cook 2 chickens.   We ate one smothered in the wine sauce.   We just could not help ourselves it was so good.

I'm Uruguayan/Argentinean and Chimichurri tastes better when you make it 1 or 2 days in advance, not the same day.  You can also use Chimichurri for marinade the chicken or any meat =)
Love Love 💙💙

Yay! I’ve been waiting for you to post this ever since I saw it on your Instagram! Already bought my chicken for this last week!
Holy smokes :) Gosh... no words, just growling tummy and hungry mouth 😍
Is it good on Pasta ?
Doin a nom nom

In Egypt we cooked beside chicken Molokhia it's amazing dish I wish you try it 😍😍😍
❤️❤️💜❤️❤️
I know what I am making for mothers day!!
Love the updated recipes, Laura!!!
Ugh last time I tried to take out backbone, it is a big pain! I will ask butch next time
I’m a vegetarian and this looks so yum to me too 😋
This looks delicious and beautiful! I wish i could do this so flawlessly!
Enjoy the day with your beautiful family.  Joe's so lucky.  That looks like a great way to roast a chicken.  So easy to put together a great meal.
omg, that looks incredible!!!  Laura, you did it again woman, I'm going to make that soon!!!
Loved the recipe, but I love love love your sassy personality :) Catch me outside, hahaha. I needed this today. I'll be thinking of you when I make this. Your daughter is getting so big. She's the cutest. Much love to you ♡
I swear she said "mmm" before she put the chicken in her mouth.. lmao
Notification comes in, happiness is seeing Laura.  Yay. Ty again for sharing your videos and recipes with us ALL.  Appreciate your time and effort.  Looks yummy.  Ty Laura. Have you ever made Sopapillas or can you share a great recipe? Haven't seen any, I used to live in Texas many years ago,  now I'm back to 🏞🌌🌠🦋NY State.  HUGS and Blessings for ALL.  Ty
Love simple and easy these days. Thanks for sharing Laura..
Looks delicious!! Can’t wait to try it. Would it be possible to do it with pieces instead of a whole chicken? And if so how much over time?
LAURA PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ON HOW TO MAKE PINA COLADA CHEESECAKE
I would love for you to do a taralli video. My grandma, who never used a recipe, made the best. I have tried to make them but I’m doing something wrong. Help!
Now THIS is my kind of meal. I had to put the CC on to see what you said but  CC is known for its 'bad translations'.... Did you call it "spatchcock"? I have never heard it called that??? Please clarify so I don't sound like the "crazy lady" asking the butcher to "spatchcock" my chicken....LOL Thanks in advance Laura.
So funny
Can’t wait to make this.
Spatchcocking is my preferred way of roasting chicken too but this chimichurru and pan sauce take it to a whole new level. My mouth was watering by the end of the video! 😍
I like it 😋
I looove this show, but strange and unnatural sense of humor lately
Looking sooooo goooddddddsd ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you laura
The chicken looks hart and dry,,
Now this is a women
My grandmothers shoes laces! I laughed so hard I wasn’t expecting that, your so funny 🤗
whats vemo
Can you please have Gordon Ramsey try one of your recipes!!???
Great Idea and tips! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us, Laura and how it is done!
C'est une blague ? 😂
Made this and it's fab. A really delicious dish. The wine sauce is good, but rich. I overindulged on leftovers last night and now (3rd day along) must take chicken off the bones and use it up. The chimichurri was also good, but since I live alone, there is a huge amount leftover. I put it on my sandwich, but how else can I use it? Can I put it into another sauce, say with yoghurt? Or somehow freeze it? How long will it keep?
Where can we buy this kind of pan.
My butcher didn't do that for me... He said, do it yourself. :(
Looks yummy Laura. Can you please show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps.
Laura can I roast cut up potatoes under the chicken or just around the chicken
yummy ummm
“Happy food” so freaking true. I just made a roasted chicken yesterday and made some roasted buttery potatoes on the side and now I’m kicking myself for not having a chimichurri on the side. One of my favorite sauces. There’s a few middle eastern versions of chimichurri too that are bomb diggitttaayyyy!
Chimichurri must be made 3 or 4 days before and stored in the fridge until the day it will be used. 
I usually fill an empty instant coffee jar -- 200 cc --  so I have 'chimi' for a month or so.
Also go easy with the vinegar ...
Laura, do you have merch now??
❤️❤️❤️ my family and I love your food!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Don't you wash the unpeeled onion and  whole garlic bulb when you make the sauce ? Looks like your rustic way of cooking means mixing dirt in the pan ?LOL !!
When non-Italians tell the Italian lady born and raised in Italy that she's pronouncing the Italian words wrong. :))))))

Go off Laura! Great video as usual
How are people going to question someone who is from Italy why she pronounces bruschetta like that 🙄
Kinda offensive telling an Italian that they are pronouncing and Italian word wrong because it’s not the English “version”
As an Italian native speaker, loved you intro!
This was the best Intro ever!
Finally you told people to shut up in the nicest way. I feel YouTubers are so easily victims of cyberbullying. Wr don't realize that what we type and leave on the internet has real and permanent effects.
Way to start your video! Go Ms Italian. All your videos are so scrumptious.  Thank you
BADASS intro. Whenever someone says the way I say “hummus” or “shawarma” is funny, I have the same reaction lol. I loved this video! Totally reminded me of last year following you on ig when you first got your pizza oven installed and you were making all kinds of deliciousness. Loved seeing those, it gave me inspo for fresh, spring/summer foods. I hope you post videos using your pizza oven!!
It’s fine.....just eat it! 🤣😂 Brava, managia si babbi americani 😋
"Just eat it!"  Yes, Ma'am!  Love the intro.
Hmmmmm girl, you tell them!!!! Love u and your recipes 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love that u say it the correct way. My hubs is Italian and I am from northern Minnesota.... I didn't even know to say pasta, I said noodles for everything lol I've learned a ton from him and learning more from u.... gotta keep his Italian tummy happy doncha know 😉
Yes Laura we will leave you for your Bruschetta Thanks for the recipes keep doing your great work appreciate it Love you Laura😘😘👏👏😜💓
Capers were “drinsed.”  Rinsed and drained = drinsed.  I love it!  😘
What a beautiful way to be assertive; you are natural, original...just wonderful! And your recipes yummy!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I am not Italian but I have adapted your way of pronouncing words(Ricotta, spaghetti, Parmesan, etc,.) because I personally love the pronunciation, and it sounds more natural, authentic, and charming.
THAT INTRO THOUGH. Yes, girl. Love you and I wouldn't change a thing
That’s right tell them you are a beautiful Italian lady and that’s how you pronounce it:) :p
I absolutely LOVE this woman and the beautifully natural way she presents herself and her recipes.  She is so refreshing, like an invigorating breath of oxygen.  Totally enjoy everything she does.
Haha.. loved the intro !!
Intro is savage...lol love you Laura..love  all your recipes
I always feel like I can taste the food because of how well you explain the taste 😋
The intro is pure gold!  <3 <3 Laura!
love you laura <3 you're the best chef
I put the peppers in the oven and then you can pull the black skin off in one piece :) loved the intro!! 😅😅
Thank you!!  I'm not Italian and have always pronounced it the way you do.
The intro alone was worth the price of admission!!!!  Obviously I'm African-American but my 1% Sardinian DNA (from AncestryDNA.com) say YESSSS!!!
I LOVE YOU!!! Everything you make looks so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️

So simple yet so fantastic looking💕 im wondering could you put a little more oil over the peppers and put it in the mason jar and Preserve it like classic anti pasti🤔?
You are so funny 😄 Being Greek I experience the same thing especially when people say moosarka rather than moussaka 😊🙂
The disclaimer thooo. 🤣🤣🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I like how Laura pronouns bruschetta, but please who cares, enjoy your cooking... that’s it

I love your channel and "your foods" . 😉💓
Wow laura ommggg this is incredible! Good thing i always have a bunch of veggies stocked up in the fridge. Im heading to the grill right now!

Well said 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Love your intro so funny and by the way like a lot your video🥰
Amen to the intro
Please continue to say “bruschetta” the way you say it! (I pronounce it the same way) who cares what people say. I love hearing you say it, sounds like home
Could you do a recipe on spaghetti and meatballs
That happened to me w the word Chili 🌶 and I speak Spanish, and I was t one saying it correctly. Lol
I got the recipe! It just hadn't loaded yet.  We are going to try this for next Friday's game night.
Nice Laura, nice! I love you.  😘
We had probably 1 week of Spring in the northeast
I love the intro!!! You tell em girl!!! 😊😊
Laura, have you ever added an anchovy (really smooshed) to the topping?  It really deepens the flavor of all the other ingredients.
Her videos are so relaxing and I just wanna see that one time. When she makes something and it’s not perfect. So I know I’m not the only one🤫😎. Just once don’t edit it out. Practice is perfection 👍🏽
Lol I never noticed... maybe because I’m 100%i Italian as well , lol looks delicious!
BEST INTRO EVER clap clap clap
Hahaha i love you Laura ❣
WOW ...come thro MAMA LAURA ...i love this new fierce laura "whoop 'em with a wooden spoon" 😂❤
I live for the rants at the beginning
Can you PLEASE update your Lasagna Recipe
Savage Laura is the best lol
Thank you for clearing up the pronunciation!  It drives me crazy when it’s said wrong!  😊  Can’t wait to make some!  😋
Nicely Done Laura 👍 for the Italian Bruschetta ❤️
I love a long video like this one. Perfect
You are pronouncing the word perfectly ! I am Italian and living in France. All my family say it just like you... Haters and ignorant people are everywhere.... xo from France <3
Yasssssss! Eat the carbs girl! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
🙌🏽You go Laura 😁 Forget  the pronunciation as long as food is delicious
I lived next door to my grandmother. I would go inside and sit at the kitchen table. Usually a little bowl with peppers, garlic and olive oil sat on the table. My grandmother would hand me a slice of French bread which I would pile with red peppers. Does life get any better than that? She lived to be 99 years old. The Mediterranean diet is the best. Thank you for your shows. I grew up on the West Coast, California.
The fact that you couldn't even finish your wrap-up sentences because you took THREE huge bites of this tells me (a) this is really good and (b) I want you to be my new best friend. ;)
Time for a knife sharpening Laura! 🥳
Laura I live next door! No actually I live in Victoria BC Canada but I wish you lived next door but I'm going to make it
U r right Laura. Your dishes look good. Pamela in Detroit
OMG the intro lol shes the best
Will you adopt me?😃😃😃  I love your recipes, your personality and enjoy your chatter.😍

BTW I'll make some piadini tomorrow: my bread for the week😍
Awesome intro! Love me some Bruschetta. Great recipe! Sharing
I love feisty Laura!!!! lol 😂
HAHAHA that intro was gold!
Love this intro! Hahaha
OMG LOVE YOU SO MUCH LAURA! IVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY
The intro alone makes me wish I could like this multiple times.
You can hear the crunch ugh 😩😩😩 i want some
Finally! Good for you
No kidding, what petty nitpickers
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 Loved the intro!!
LOVE YOUR INTRO🤣🤣🤣😭😭
Yassss that intro👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Killed me!! 😂
yummiliciously great
Subscribed because of epic intro rant!
LOVEEEED THE INTro 😍
Your platter looks so beautiful and I love how you defend yourself and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!!!!
do you have a recipe for Pasta con le sarde ?
Laura will you post the garlic chicken you made a couple of weeks ago? It was a whole roasted chicken you flattened!
Are you under medication? just that you’re talking too fast and stumbling on your words, I prefer your older recipes.
If you’re ever back in the Center City/South Philly area of Philadelphia.... check out La Fontana Della Citta 👌👌👌
You’re too cute Laura!! This looks delicious 😊😊❤️
Haha Laura don’t forget mahhhhzerella cheese 😹
You Go girl enough is enough 👍👏👏
Love the intro 😂
You are very wonderful. Thank you for all of your giving.
You tell em Laura!!!!
Amen, Laura!!! Potato/Patahto....Spaghetti/Spageetee....”let me live!” Thank you! Wonderful videos, looks delicious! Thanks for another wonderful video/recipe!
That's wassup having ya girl back like that, I luv giada as well, lil cute Italian women
This looks beautiful as well as delicious!
this is my favorite food. i can eat it everyday😻
That intro tho 😂😂😂
The way she keeps eating makes me laugh. 3 bites before she can talk 😂😂😂
Laura, you are the best!
"It's fine just eat it"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 mood
Everything from 0:16 to 0:35 is the disclaimer we need 😂😂😂

On a serious note, I prefer pronouncing words as they are meant to be in their source languages. I'm a hospitality worker, so it is important to me.
I love you Laura Vitale
Love that you eat real!!!!  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
YOU BE YOU SAY IT THE WAY YOU SAY IT GIRL YOU DONT OWE NOBODY NOTHIN.
Love this recipe!
Love the intro but I think the situation with the other chef is that she is rude about it. And like there is no need.. like you said “just eat it”
everything you cook/bake looks soooooo yummy Laura! thank you!
Love you Laura! I’m gonna make some of this soon. ❤️🧡💛
OMG THE THUMBNAIL 😋
NIce recipe my friend ..... And nice intro music too ..... I love it ...... Very strange for me to cook peppers this way ..... I didn't know this tip ..... Thanks a lot for this great video my friend  ...... 💖🍚🍎🍭🍊😍
Most Non PC intro I've seen yet. Hahaha I love you girl!
So Beautiful 😍 ❤
La cucina italiana,dall'antipasto al dolce,è la migliore del mondo! Saluti dalla Sicilia 😘
I love it!!! "...it's fine just eat it..." 😄
Lmao the intro! 😂 Get em' Laura
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Girl.I'm also Italian and i'm sitting here watching you eat and it reminds me of me when I want to eat.Wait till I'm done then talk to me.Love you little lady,never stop being you.
That into= THE. BEST.
Loved the intro 😂😂😎😎
Laura your the very best.
I’ve watched your videos for months and I haven’t cooked since 2017 😭😭 I just love watching you cook!
This intro is everything.
Going to make this today Laura, capers are a great idea. Love your channel.
Thank you so very much for sharing and showing us how you roast your peppers! I've been cooking well over 50 years and have never been able to get them with the right texture or the flavour. Until now. I used your method and wow, what a difference. I'm so grateful you showed us your method.
ahhhhh i asked for roasted peppers i’m so excited!!
I liked this vid for the intro, stayed for the food
Nice intro
Joe must get very Hungary waiting for his share
Great intro! More antipasti videos, pls?
Me too i love your foods!😁😁
YAS PROLOGUE
I love her recipes sooooo much!!!
I love the intro
I could eat that whole tray of bread, peppers and tomatoes. My mouth is watering. 😁😘
LAURA CAN YOU MAKE A VIDEO ON HOW TO MAKE A PINA COLADA CHEESECAKE
Just found you! You are the bomb! I’m hooked
Looks so good.  But, I don’t eat bread.  Darn!  😥
Where can I buy the grill pan?
Can you do an updated version of your berry topped cheesecake
Everything you said was okay!. But PLEASE.... don't say EYE-Talian.... it's not EYE-taly!!!
Looks delicious!!!
It's fine! Just eat it! 😆
Heaven on a plate!!!👌🏻😁
I don't understand why people throw the tomato seeds and juice away??
Fantastic recipe
My mouth is watering....lol
That crunch 😋😋. That will be my spring summer food . Thank you for sharing
Bravo Laura!  But, it's not only you.  Giada DeLaurentis pronounces Italian words correctly and with an Italian accent and YT critics skewer her about it.  A headshaker, for sure.  Regarding removing the charred skin, a dulled knife can scrape gently then be dipped into rinse water as needed.
Absolutely love  this video! :D
YOU'RE STUNNING
that some good lookin brewskghetti
Your intro was the BEST !!!!! YOU DO YOU GIRL !!!!
Laura, my mom always puts freshly roasted peppers in aluminum foil or  zipper bag. Once it is colder, the skin comes right off. I don't think it changes the flavor, what do you think?
How do you spell that place in south philly?
hahahahahaha I love it, let a girl live!!! you tell em!!!
Wowwwww👌👌😍😍
Ur funny laura! I love u
I make this without the capers but you make it look so delicious I have to try this! I’ve used so many of your recipes and have had so many compliments so thank you!
Looks amazing!
Funny. If I remember correctly, on your first ever video on tomato and basil bruschetta, you actually pronounced it "bruscetta".
Ba da bing!
Mia should do a taste test at the end of all your videos that would be sooo cute .😍
Like if you agree!
“Just eat it!” 👏🏻 LOVE it !!
love love love you
I heart you Laura!
When I was a kid, my mother's favorite weapon was the wooden spoon.  I think my brothers and I still have a few marks from it...
💥💥💥💥🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm not Italian but I love when you cook especially your salmon and vegetables oh my goodness goodness dipped with soy sauce look girl you got to go on in the kitchen keep giving us the recipes and I'm going to try this one even though I'm not Italian.
yeha just eat it😍
Preach it sister!! Amen
“It’s fine, it’s good, just eat it” 😂 this was the greatest intro ever. 🖤 love the idea of adding the capers!! Will be making this soon.
You go girl
Sassy!!!😍 love it
Just made this for lunch today... yummy!!!
👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻 preach girl!
Lol! People are so weird!  I love the way you say “ bruschetta”😊
Hi Laura. The recipe looks yummy. Can you show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps.
It's so italian how she uses her hands I love it haha
yummy I love it I am italen too I am gemovess
It’s fine, just eat it!!!  That should be a t-shirt. Haha.
Lol @ the intro .. i had to watch it 3 times before i watched the video .. love  it .. pronounce it in your native tongue .. that’s where you are from and it sounds more authentic!!
to get those peppers charred you can use the electric broiler in a pinch ;)
It snowed today in Edmonton...
Would that bread grill pan work on an electric burner /stove
really awesome . you are the best
washes peppers in water
Ok time to wait
Yesss definitely do updated recipes! That would be awesome :) Also, I like the way you say it - you know, the correct way lol!
Lol! You tell it! I got chastised for saying it the way you say it! I was told it was wrong.. (i lived in Firenze before too haha) people! Haha..
🤣🤣🤣
Omg best summer dish with a nice glass of red wine 🍷😜
LOOK'D GOOD!!!!!
😂💞💥🥰
What if you don’t have this bread thingie?
Yummy, love the video Laura!!!💗
Very delicious 👌👌👌
You go Laura with GREAT ATTITUDE INTRO👍🌈🌈💃🏻💃🏻 love the recipe 🌈🌈 and love you Laura 🤗❤️💕💕 every time you taste food at the end, I can feel all the flavors 👍
that intro🙌🏼 you always keep it 💯 love you mrs. vitale!!
i loveyou laura vitale! love your cooking show:) from manila, philippines
I’m SO HAPPY that your videos are actually showing up in my video feed now. No clue why they weren’t before but yay!
I bloody love you!
Love how real you keep it. Can't wait to see more revamped recipes.
I grew up as the only Irish family in an all Italian neighborhood!!!! How lucky was I!!!   All my friends mothers were fabulous Cooks and I was always have meals at my friend's houses...Delicious homemade pastas, sauces, breads, cookies (especially Christmas time!) (sorry Mom..but we all know it tastes better at a friend's house) and I learned all the "right" ways to pronounce Italian foods from them and used to get in trouble from non Italians saying I don't know the right way to say it..haha..It's okay..it all tastes delicious...and I truly miss my friends Italian mothers cooking most who have passed away..God bless them!  but thankfully they all paid attention and that's fortunate for me!
She gettin sassy haha
Who pronounces it brueshetta
Thank you
Looking cute 😊👍
You're sooooo funny!
I've ;been looking for that stove top toaster since i saw you use it a few years ago!  I just ordered  2  from Fante's!!!!!!!!!  thank YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  also. i hate when people make me feel like i'm pronouncing ricotta and mozzerella incorrectly..  i'm italian and i say it  correctly!  LOL  keep doing what you do, keep doin you bo..  ive been a fan for years!!!!!!!
I love ur personality 😁and of course ur recipes😋😋😋😋👍👍👍
Okay queen popped off. We stan an italian-american queen
LMAO
you are the reason I love to cook now ! I remember all ur intros and everything LOVE U
@lauraInTheKitchen....... In my country you'll hear 'spagetti' but what we're really saying is 'eh-pagetti" and it works. LOL everyone knows the dish. Oh and what an awesome tip on preparing the peppers and adding the cappers!!! I will try it next time i make this dish.
Yum!
beautiful
You seemed in a bad mood this video..
Your intro hooked me, loved it.  New scriber
It's fine. Just eat it!😂😂😂😂
I felt your p.s.a
That's ITALIAN! Keep being you Laura....teach the ignoramuses the correct pronunciation and you're too nice, don't apologize!
I have never seen her cop an attitude lol cute
Looks good
Hahah just eat it !!
No parm?
SO TRUE
What is the name of the pan?
adopt me
When the fabulous, sexy, yet bad-butt Italian threatens to come over with her favorite weapon the wooden spoon to "teach you a thing or two about a thing or two" after an intro like that, then you know it's not only worth watching but absolutely necessary to save into a playlist for future reference on dealing with jerks in a polite way.
Ps..using paper towel to take off the skin from the pepper is WAY easier!! 😊
Gotta say, I love your rant .... people stop looking for everyone’s little differences and calling them wrong. Sheesh!
Omg! Laura that antipasti : Brusdhetta and roasted peppers looks delicious! My mouth is watering lol 👌🏼😋 Thank you for sharing. ❤️
This looks so good! can't wait to try it!  What is the name of the appliance you use to toast the bread?? Thanks!
where i can buy the Bruschetta Pan?
You tell ‘em!  You shouldn’t even have to explain.
Let them have it Laura! Love your bruschetta 💖💖💖
That part tho 0:00 to 0:34 omg 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏Girlllllllll
What is the name of that tray for toasting the bread?
Very delicious 👌
Yummmy
❤️
❤️
Brava Laura!!! 👍😘
You corrected people in the nicest way possible, lol.  A pet peeve of mine is when people mispronounce Italian words.  I once got corrected by a waitress, at Applebees, on pronouncing bruschetta.  I pronounced it the correct way and she did not.
It's ok Laura, I'm a Brit living in America and get told I pronounce English words wrong too
how is nona?
Where in Philly did you get the bruschetta pan from?
I love learning the correct pronunciations as you learning it from one's native country.  I will let you live as I love your recipes, keep them coming.  Ignore the bullies!
What is the pan for the bread called, I'm having a hard time finding
A lightly damp and paper towel and gently wipe the pepper down to get all the burnt off of it it comes off like a charm every time this seems like a lot more work just the tippppp
Thank god you call it that way cause I once (not sure) heard you say it the wrong way and I got a rash. It really freaks me out when people say it the wrong way. 😂😂😂
Or how Ina pronounces tagliatelle. Ooooooh my God!! I almost had an aneurysm 😳
The salt and pettiness is real. Yeesh.
❤️❤️ Tks !
I love watching you and love you !! 
Your receipt are so easy and thank you for always sharing !! You the best 💜
BRUSCHETTA! Non c'e` niente di meglio!!!! Brava!
LOL Americans are the most entitled bunch of nuts . 

FOH with your chai tea and naan bread 🙄
１コメ
That's some really large basil leaves ! What kind is it ?
bello il basilico la dietro peccato che si è un po appassito
Wipe
I only meant to take a quick peek at this vid and I ended up watching the whole thing! Love your videos.
This looks absolutly amazing, Laura! I love italian food. But there is so much I can't make because of my coliaki (gluten allergi) and because I can't get what I need to make it. Very sad. But this resipe is easy to make. You are the best! Hugs from Norway.
I like your style
“Purple basil! It’s purple!”  I will remember that every time I hear basil! Lol
Omg.  Mouth water
Love your correct pronounciations...You live guuuurrrrl!
I tell you lol We Americans got issues 😂 we love butchering other people’s languages then get mad when people can’t speak English 😂 and we tell others how to speak their own language lol. You tell them Laura! I’m obviously generalizing here but you get the point.
Lol
Love this dish!  I’m making for my next outdoor event.  But I’m making for my family tonight.  Yum!
Laura's a mother now and doesn't have time for your nonsense!!! 😍😍😍
Whats the name of the bruschetta pan?
Love y
Loved the way you told them off.
Tell me more about the bread pan please. It’s a bruschetta pan?
Love it!! I can almost taste them!! lol so refreshing and tasty!!
Just eat it!
I am so so glad you have put your thoughts across on how to pronounce words the "correct" way. I have always seen tons of discussion under your videos, be it on nutella, bruschetta, tiramisu or parmigiano-reggiano where people claim that you (being a native Italian speaker) are pronouncing it all wrong :/. Sometimes I would see that you would pronounce the words in the American accent (your original bruschetta video was pronounced that way) and I always wondered if that was only to please the American audience. But now you have put people in their place with this kick-ass intro. Yes, it doesn't matter how people will pronounce bruschetta, but there is only ONE correct way to pronounce it and that is the italian way :D.
Does your daughter like to eat? She looks like a finicky eater huh !
Yaaas tell em laura
What kind of wine goes with bruschetta red or white?
I roast my peppers ring on top of my electric stove burners. Works just as well as on a gas stovetop. Been doing it like this for years.
Absolutely fantastic. What kind of bread did you use? Was it a sough or an Italian loaf? I cannot find the recipe. I found about 8 recipes under Bruchetta but none of them were from today. I even tried Bruschetta with Roasted Peppers.
why do you call it a brus-ket-a
Chile Poblanos? Same way to cook the pepper
I know this isn't relevant to the episode, but, I feel like Laura is the sexiest woman on the planet.
“It’s fine. It’s good. Just eat it” Love it! ❤️👍🏼😄
The proper pronunciation is yours Laura! However! Giana over does it!
Why don’t you just want the peppers down with a wet paper towel I do it all the time with jalapeño poppers
WHAT. SHE. SAID. NOW EAT!!!!!
👌🌹🌷🌼🌿🌸💜💛💚❤👌✌😘😜😀👐🌼😘
Where you live
MY GOD NON ITALIANS WONT UNDERSTAND!!! ITS THE PROPER WAY TO SAY IT!!!!! LOL. LEAVE HER BEEEEEEEE
I get an abundance of peppers from my garden, can I roast them, prep them, then freeze them?
@Laura Vitale, can you share with us an updated version of strawberry shortcake for your strawberry shortcake cheesecake brownies recipe? This is so perfect for this time of year simply because 1) strawberries are in season and 2) this recipe is perfect for this spring and summer season if you're going strawberry picking and want to make something that is SO impressive and so delicious. I can't wait for you to share with us this delicious recipe.
Girl I just made some Salmon Kebabs under the broiler!! Bomb!!
She is Italian, but she hanging out with Black People. I can tell
Hello from Torrance California
Yes, I love the idea of updated versions of older recipes! I’d love to see an updated Black Forest Cake please. Also, please take care when posting the recipes online, as some of the measurements have been incorrect. Thank you.
Yo, Girl - get yourself some good, proper Japanese Knives....give up on the European knives....
Wow, love the recipe.  The addition of the capers will really give it a kick.  Love the food names in Italian rather than Itanglish 😋
Who wants Mia in every video?! 😍😍
You need to make this series something with “Momma Mia in the kitchen”
She was so done with them kisses at the end Mama. 😂
What a beautiful baby. How lucky it is to have such a mama, you get to eat all the delicacies
She has gotten so big!

Beautiful young star in the making. SO cute. You and cake are wonderful as well. Thanks!
You are so pretty and your daughter is so cute
I tried this recipe and I loved it! It's perfect for when you need to "bring something" and you don't want to mess with something that may not work out (usually this is exactly when it doesn't work out) This one is easy. and it doesn't have any underwater stones to watch for .  One of those "guaranteed success" recipes. Thank you, Laura!
Will be making this recipe this week! Also, Mia is literally the cutest girl in the world!!❤
She has grown sooo fast. <3
I can't even deal with how cute Mia is.  I love seeing her in your videos.  <3
Mia is so cute and you two are so beatiful together. Mia and her mom are a super team. Hugs to both from Norway.

ciao, adoro i dolci con la ricotta ma soprattutto adoro i dolci al limone e penso proprio che questo dolce possa diventare il mio preferito...brava come sempre
Omgosh she is so adorable...dancing after she bites the cake ❤️
I made this and it was in fact delicious.   Thank you for showing the correct texture or I would have worried I did something wrong!  One tip for others - don’t sprinkle with the powdered sugar until the last second before serving... it absorbs!
her eyes are so beautiful. I really adore you cutie pie!!
Everybody needs a little Mia happy dance in their life! So sweet 😘

Sansa Stark really appreciates this. Lemon cake is her favorite cake.
Omg Mia is so cute!! I always loved baking with my mom so it’s so awesome how much you involve her! 💕😊
Thank you for your fabulous recipes!  My family loves them!  When you have time, please consider making more asian cooking videos - our family loves to eat healthy and asian food incorporates many healthy and tasty ingredients.  Chicken chow mein would be a great one to start with. (I realize you are Italian and we love Italian food too but your beef and broccoli and your Korean beef recipes were AMAZING so I know you have more!) Thanks!
Little Girl Would Look Wonderful With A Tiara . 👸 My Wife’s Niece’s Name Is Mia Neige. French Name (Quebec ) . Name is French For Snow ❄️

She is so cute she looks just like you
Is Laura pregnant again or am I crazy
So I was confused as to why we should use part almond flour and part all purpose flour, and not all regular flour?
Laura, I'm so shocked - I just checked for your episode on pasta with Gorgonzola sauce. And guess what? I found out that even after 1346 episodes you haven't done one! Why on earth is that? You are so letting me down here ;)
You and your 👶 baby are so cute together Laura.😊😉😄💐
I’m going to eat that little girl ❤️❤️❤️
could not find recipe
She's so sweet! But what happened to her hand?! Poor baby
Very allergic to Almonds, what should I do....

I saw you on the Wendy Williams show today! I've been subscribed to your channel for 3 years now. Congratulations!🎊🎀🎉
That salad looks amazing.
Hi Laura, all nut oils can be stored in fridge and they won't go rancid. I have hazelnut and walnut oil in my fridge for at least 6 months and it is still good.
I love green beans! Such a good recipe to try going into spring 😋
Can you make a CRAP DIP RECIPE?
Omg looks so good.  Wonder if feta cheese would be good in it.
Hi, Laura. At the beginning of this video the fry pans on the wall behind you make it look like you are wearing Mickey Mouse ears.
Superrr ...
Please support me all
Looks great, especially the dressing.
Is there a shopping list for this?
I saw you on Wendy!!!
I can't wait to make this!  I'm always looking for something a little different for a green salad and this looks like a winner, dressing looks really yummy also.
Another great one for the books , thank you  !
Idk why I think I rather can green beans better in this,the real ones I like by themselves
When you get it lined up right with the dark pots and pans against the back wall, you look like you're wearing Mickey Mouse ears!
Hi Laura. The recipe looks yummy. Can you show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps.
I’m definitely going to try the recipe. I’m always trying to find refreshing meals for work. I’ll just switch out the nuts for seeds because I can’t eat nuts.
Very good and pretty salad, perfect for family reunions, by the way Happy Easter for you and your family, love
Basil dressing - great idea with green beans!
Hi Laura do you have a recipe on fried ice cream
Delicious salad Laura!!! 🥗🥰
I saw you on Wendy Williams this morning! Do you have the recipes that you did on the show?
Laura Happy Easter, is there another lettuce I can replace the ruggla with love your videos have a happy Holiday
Dear Laura, I made this today and it was such an epic new way of eating green beans 👌💚👌!!! Perfect to pair with Honey Mustard Chicken or Citrusy Baked Salmon. Thank you so much for sharing 🥰

Never has my mouth watered for salad at 2 in the morning. Definitely will give this a try.

Hi Laura, I have a request for a oven top round roast in the oven.I made one for  Easter and it was tough. Would love a video on how to cook one that would be moist.  Thanks!!  Loved seeing you on WW Show.
Feta cheese would be a great addition!
I need this salad!!

Love green beans💚


I saw you on Wendy today! You were AMAZING!!!🙌
LOOK'D GOOD!!!!!
You don’t string the tails of green beans.
Talk to fast for me i can't get it all, sorry.
This looks delicious.  Could one use flax seed oil?
Cousin Laura!!! The dressing is going to set this combination off!
Too many ingredients...
I wish the shot of the food was longer at the end so we can really get a good look at it. The camera swoops in and is gone on a flash. 😟
Looks delish!
I never try one before
Beautiful and looks so delicious.
Another great looking meal. Thank you Laura.
It is sooo yummy! I tried it! Wooo!
Looks so good. I love Green Beans. They are so healthy and full of fiber. 😋
I love eating salads.
What time is dinner? 😂
Yummmm!!!
You were Amazing on the Wendy Williams Show today !!!!!! LOVE YOU ........
This looks so yummy
I'm not that a healthy eater person ... But I love beans ✓ so that's a check there... Wanna try this very soon ...😍
Seems Very Fab. 🍽🥒🥬 Yumm!💐(havetotry)•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••!
hi laura that looks good how is the baby
Soo cool I saw you on Wendy today !!!  your salad looks delicious
Whoa. When she shook the beans and the camera freaked out my brain also freaked out.
Love what you  cook
Awesome !
Very appetizing😍😍😍😍😋
always liked green beans, then i showed Lana the green beans to grow the; jack and the beanstalk, so now i am impressed by your green bean cooking, and i shall ask Lana to cook with me, we will cook until we can grow a hamburger green beanstalk, IT MAKES NO SENSE, whatever, i'm tired, i like Lana.
Milf status

Ok girl. I love you and have been a faithful follower for 10 yrs even though you are 21 winks. But you lost me here. I have no idea what is going on ! Lol can ya reshoot this pls :) again, much love,  from Canada
Laura stay off the Wendy Williams show!!! So awkward the way she rushes you.
The one who makes her makeup should be gone right away. Makes her 10 years older
Id like to lick your bean and toss your salad! 
👅
"A Green Bean Salad You'll Want To Eat!" Nope, nope aaand nope! I'm all for green beans but it has OLIVES in it!


Still, awesome recipe, don't get me wrong! :)
I’m going to use a 9 by 13 so she can come over lol 😂
Laura ,if you’re reading this, PLEASE make a fun Dirt cup with Oreos. I’d love to see your spin on it .
I'm loving the bloopers in the beginning!
A couple things if I may: we need bloopers, always! And, Laura Vitale merch? Hello? Yes please. I'd die.
BEAUTIFUL BLOOPERS!! I lovr this recipe thanks so much
Hi Laura....can you possibly make a cassata cake ? It's an Italian traditional recipe 😊
Omg how perfect would these be for Easter shaped like an egg! Or during Christmas with red and green krispies! Ok getting ahead of myself. 😬 I’m honestly more of a chocolate person, so you’ll def be seeing these with chocolate cereal in the mix for me. 🙌🏽
“You’re the boss apple sauce!” I like it, I like it Laura!!
Yessss! I was looking for some treats I can make for my sons birthday coming up so I don’t have to dig deeper into my pockets and this is perfect! I’m so excited. Thank you Laura! ❤️❤️

Amazing crispy treats Laura. Thank you so much

When you said: Fruity Crispies I was thinking: Skittles !!! , 
  I'm Gunna Try Adding Skittles and Crushed Up Oreos MMMMmmm 🤔 🙄🙃 🙄😀 🙂😎 🙄👍
I am 100% Italian and just have to say, "you have very pretty eyes Laura"...
Laura, have you made "Gnudi" before? I recently heard of it and hope you can make it and show us the recipe.
LMBOOOOOOOO at these intros! I love this channel!
Love when you ate some off the spoon then threw it back in the pot without a care! 😁  Laura is the best!
I have been doing this for years and years, they are soooooo yummy. But I haven't added salt, but I do everything else the same 😊👍
You could also use crushed up sandwich cookies (instead of the fruity cereal).
Anybody else find it so satisfying when she cut into them ?🙋‍♀️
Laura please make the brazilian pudim.  Love from brazil 💕💕💕
Can we have a bloopers compilation?? 🙌🙌
pickled strawberries wouldve went well with this ........

#queenofeasy
LOOK'S GOOD!!!!! I'LL HAVE SOME!!!!!
Wowwwww👌👌👌👌👌👌
My grandma always made the best rice krispie bars. Lots of butter, lots of marshmallow. My mom totally skimped on both. I can still feel the dryness of the cereal on my teeth. Not okay!
my son will l💖ve these Rice Krispie treats, thank you for sharing this with us.
I’m always confused. Laura moved but her kitchen is the same? I missed that part somewhere, my fault. I’m gonna make this for easter.
She looks so stunning
Hi Laura! How are you?
I love your channel but I can't afford all the extra insulin I'd have to buy to eat something like this!  Thanks for sharing though.
Could the marshmallow be dyed a different colour on this? X
Can u please make a vid on how to make petit fours just simple ones thank u i would really appreciate that! ;)
Can u make chicken scarpiello pleaseeeeee?
Omg what
yummyyyyyyyyy!
Just made this today for my 3 year old (who am I kidding, they are for meeeee) QUICK and EASY for sure but mostly DELICIOUS. I confess I wanted it to be like fonfetti cake so I used cake batter "extract."  Only 1 tsp though.
yas mam
in my imagination,  it's too sweet >''<
I was pretty surprised she didn't cut it into nine squares lol
Yay new video 😁😁
Great now I have to go make treats yummy
Yum.
very appetizing😍😍😍😋😍!!
How come you don’t include the episode number anymore? And these look great!
Can i use other cereals instead of rice krispies? Its not easy to find one in my country i dont know why 😢
Yummy
we do not want smoke in your house
Yummy thx
I need a tshirt with that threatening face with the wooden spoon with the phrase "ima come ova"
Omg i wanna try it.




🍹🍷🍴🍕🍔🍟🍗🍖🍝🍛🍤🍱🍣🍥🍙🍘🍚🍜🍲🍢🍡🍳🍞🍩🍮🍦🍨🍧🎂🍰🍪🍫🍬🍭
Waving the big wooden spoon --"if you use a 9 x 13, I'm gonna come over",   I could only wish!!      Made these and took them to work, way big hit.
Look very good
I’m from England- what’s fruity cereal?
🍇🍈🍉🍊🍋🍌🍍🍒🍓🍎🍏🍐🍑🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡🍡
Laura hey boo thing if you can teach me how to do this I'll teach you the art of the cheek isolation it's when you do it one cheek at a time.
Am I the only one who is not attracted at all by this type of sweets. I mean, I do love baked goods and cook them quite often, also plenty of Laura’s desserts even, but this kind is just not appealing to me...
That make up... guuuuurl, are you cosplaying pikachu? Always camera test the make up, come oooooon. The recipe looks awesome, though.
Laura knows 4,000 recipes and makes all of them all the time.
WHOA! That' really IS epic! It's like a scotch egg meatloaf! ❤️❤️❤️
Who else here LOVES meatloaf like I do? ❤️
You KNOW you’re Italian when you have 2 kitchens.. 😂
"Four pounds of salami, could you imagine? 4-- although...."
You're so amazing I love your channel your personality and all of you are recipes 🥰🥐🌮🍤🥮🎂🥧
Lol, the peas  always burn ....should put them at the end 5minutes
I like all of your recipes 😍
Laura... You do things with your own kind of elegance! Good job!!
"You can't have this without the potatoes"
Everyone on the Keto diet:😒


Still gonna make it though.😂
Laura, Thank You so much for this receipt, it so delicious😋You are the best 🤗
i tried it and the meatloaf is AMAZING!!!
WOW, this looks absolutly amazing, Laura! Meat anything is so good. Thank you so much! You are the best. But please please. Maybe you can colab with Rosanna Pansino one day. That would be so funny to watch and you can check out her baking line and maybe create something on your own.... That would be awsome. Lots of love and hugs from Norway.
I don’t even like meatloaf but you really have me wanting to try this one!
OMF, I love meat loaf, so this is a definite try. I am LIVING for this recipe! * Q *
This meatloaf looks absolutely delicious.
This one looks really tasty. Certainly hungry now!
Thanks laurie  for this amazing recipe, I've been watching you since your second year in youtube Love you!
Yum! Who doesn't love Meatloaf? 👍 🙋🏻💕💖
In Argentina we make it the same but for a cheapier recipe we use ham and cheese.. I guess we adopt the recipe from the Italian people that migrate to Argentina
Who else thinks she one of the best cooks on YouTube ??
Hi Laura, if u can't use Pork meats what other meats can u use with ur cheese for ur processor??  Ty
Oh em gee.. you should sooooooo do a collab or a video with Italian grandma Gina from her channel: Buon-A-Petitti I love you both!!!
Just saw this on your insta stories!! It looks so amazing! I’m Orthodox Christian and our Easter is one week after traditional Easter. This may be getting featured on our table 😍 also, I love the idea of updated past recipes! Food and the way we make it is always evolving. I’ve had my cooking channel for 2 years and I’m already thinking of updated versions of some recipes!
Sei incredible,  grazie bella  ❤👌🌺
Oh my goodness!!!! This meatloaf is really beautiful and so yummy. I am going to make it for my family: I am sure we are gonna love it 😋. Thank you Laura for this recipe. Love from France 🇫🇷

Cousin Laura!!! We love you updating the recipes!!!! This is such a treat!
OMG, there is so much flavor in your other meat loaf recipe (the one with the red sauce on top) and now you have taken this meat loaf up a notch, so, I can only imagine how fantastic this is going to be. Thank you for this fabulous recipe.
ALL your Recp. are Delishas! I tried the green bean / arugula salad , for my baby daughters potluck , she said it was great , everyone loved it , and went right away. Thank you for your Recp. 🥔🍽🍷
probably with a gravy would be more complete but it is easy to prepare and looks tasty
I have never tried meatloaf but I will definitely give this a try. Thankyou for all your great recipes. ❤️
Making me so hungry! Looks great
Yo Laura I love you! I'm definitely gonna try this one.
Very Epic!

Hi Laura I really enjoy your videos I just started watching you recently because I've been looking for some new cooking shows 😻 I havent tried your recipes yet 😭 but I hope to soon if I can
Why did I see the thumbnail/title and refused to click UNTIL I went back and watched all your potato videos 😂🤣 I had to get the sides nailed down first, and NOW I’m ready for this life you’re about to give me.
I love your show. This recipe looks really good. Who makes the pan you used? I want one.
I have to make this when my boss son comeback from UK i know they're gonna love this,,
Thanks Laura for sharing ur recepe
Hi Laura. The recipe looks yummy. Can you show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps
Looks so delicious!! Making this tomorrow!
I was wondering for the Sharp Provolone, would could i still use the shredded provolone?
Hi Laura,  what, if anything,  can be used instead of the pork meat,  as I don't eat pork?
Btw,  I really love the parchment paper trick!
Laura the pots on the wall behind you make you appear to be wearing Mickey Mouse Ears . Joking. Take Care . Something Tells Me You Play The Stradivarius Violin 🎻 .

Eggcelent, Lana recently cooked a meal with eggs.
Damn! I need a food processor! Looks like love out of the oven 😍
Thanks Laura! I will try it this weekend!!! Lol!!
I'm going to try this for Easter Sunday lunch... The only thing I may do differently is I'll hold back with putting in the peas until the end, so that they'll still have a firm texture .... Buona Pasqua 🙏
No eggs for me. I love meatloaf. I really love your turkey meatloaf recipe!
Laura at the end, with a prepared forkful in her hand, is me!
Oops, the written recipe calls for turkey!
Definitely making this for Pascha. It'll be extra wonderful after coming off a 40 day meat and dairy fast.
Love this! Id always follow your recipes to the T! You definately know what your doing!
That is a great recipe combination! I'm so going to make this!
Wow, I made this today Sunday. It wasn’t sure about the eggs.  I stepped out of my box....yes this is delish.   I used fingerling potatoes.  Thank you.
Looks delicious. I might be inclined to throw the pees in at the last minute instead of cooking them the whole time in that hot oven.
Hhmmm...I am not on social media. never intended to be a part of the non real virtual world....but I am going to look into instagram, just so I can follow you and your cooking. You should charge instagram....you have mentioned instagram on your other videos too.
I know what im making this looks so yummy thank you sooo much your deadly AWSOME

My Italian mom always made her meatloaf with the hardboiled eggs in the middle. Literally the best meatloaf on the planet.
Definitely gonna try this.
Provolone isn’t readily available in the UK. What would be the best alternative to use?

💦 FED EX ME A PIECE 💦
Im'ma have to quarter this recipe for me because my picky eaters just wouldn't understand the heaven that this is.
I really like her.her accent is cute
This looks so yummy.
Can show a recipe using leftover meatloaf?? Even if it’s super simple! Show what sides you serve with it lol
I  have tried MANY of your recipes, and they are delish. Can’t wait to try this one yum
Hi Laura ! I made your recipe today and I don’t know what mistake I made, but the loaf is very very dry and hard, there is no sauce or any liquid left for the potatoes and the loaf.
Can you please help ? Normally , when I shape the loafs, I get my hands wet, but as you don’t mention something like that, I didn’t..
Laura,, your videos are amazing. I just put meatloaf in the oven, then I tuned into your meatloaf video and it looked so good. I will try your recipe next time. I have had roasted Brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes on the side with mine, either way it's delicious. Keep up the good work Laura you have a beautiful personality. 😊
Just one question...do you peel the hard boiled eggs before adding to the meat mixture? 😳 just kidding! 😆. This looks amazing! I can’t wait to try it.
This woman from Columbia made this roast chicken with potatoes and peas many years ago. I remember she also used mayonnaise. I was so delicious many years ago this reminded me of it.
:)
Looks yummy 👅
What is this 🍅 tomato salad you speak of?
Looks very tasty!
I’m making this today, I’ll let you how it comes out
Making again, today! Setting it up to go on oven at 12. 2lbs. Gr. Veal, 1 of ge. Beef and 1 of gr. Pork.going to use 3 eggs. 4 cl. Fresh Garlic. Dried ( as my garden isn't set up yet) basil and a pinch of oreg. Have 1/2lb. Each salami and provolone. I save a few slices to overlap half circles down the top of the loaf. Thank you again for this great, great recipe. Made my own fresh crumbs seasoned with a spoonful of genomes pesto and then toasted them. Oh, my. My friends love your recipe.
Looks yummy!! 💖💖
potato salad not tomato  salad # it's okay we all make mistakes
yum
Those Peas are Burnt to Hell!
Is anyone else having trouble getting notifications? the bell didn't go off for this... ugh
Can we leave out the hard boiled eggs?
Yummy 😋
The eggs made it not interesting...
Yummy 😋
Is there a way to make this without pork? :(
Think I’m going to try. Can’t do eggs, would have to leave out the hard boiled eggs. The other egg won’t hurt me! Looks good!
Time we saw mamma and u both doing some cooking...mamma mia mwahhhhh
HI Laura. Making this today! Have it all put together. Used old sourdough bread, 3 days, to make crumbs in processor and ground it with fresh garlic, fresh it. parsley, basil and a touch oregano. Had a few extra slices of provolone so overlapped them on top. Just making the mix made my kitchen smell devine. My company is going to be sooo happy!😂
Thank you for such a great recipe.
Those poor little peas...
Can anyone tell me what cast iron skillet she’s using? I’d like to buy one.
Make sure you PEEL the eggs, ladies!!!
Once you try italian meat loaf, you won't need any other kind of meat loaf in your life.
Trying this recipe tonight. Any tips for cooking this for 8 people? Thanks!
Sorry but we don't eat pork 😥😥😥
I need to get my son making this, looks awesome!!!
I don't like eggs period
Those eggs tho,eh I’ll pass what’s the need for those. It looks dry
Non avevo mai messo salame e prosciutto nell'impasto, solo uovo, parmigiano, pecorino e prezzemolo. La tua versione è molto interessante la proverò
I am sure it will taste good. But it looks like a hair ball on potatoes
I want two kitchens.
Yikes! Lots of fat!
You had me drooling right up until the hard boiled eggs.  I've been making Italian meatloaf for 30+ years but no HB eggs.  We also cover the meat with Italian gravy at the end of the cooking.
Gosh—I know what the hubs and I are having for Sunday lunch!! I guess I’ll have to make half without the hard boiled eggs, though—he won’t eat a hard boiled egg unless it’s deviled. When my mother roasts a chicken, she always put a bag of frozen Lima beans (baby size are best, I think) in the bottom of the roasting pan—I’m not going to lie—those Lima beans cooked in the chicken juices and fat are my favorite things in the whole world!!!
why are you trying too hard to be italian but not succeeding in doing it.
اكلنا نحن العرب الذ من اكلكم ،،😃😄
Make a buffalo chicken Mac and cheese video
Wow~ These crepes look so GOOD! Love the berry sauce. I'm gonna try it! ❤️❤️❤️

Very good  Laura
Can you plsss do your pantry staples;)
Incredible!
Perfection.
In Sweden it's tradition to eat peasoup on thursdays, and after the soup we eat Swedish pancakes/crêpes with any jam we like. :D it was basically a staple food in the kitchen when I grew up.
I came for the food but that eye look kept me here. Could you tell me what it is please?
Now I'm hungry!
Dang Boy!
Ok I'm doing this for tomorrow! Can you make a video about easy decorations for cakes or other deserts? 🌸(I'm watching you from the time you had 10k subs! All my family members know that I'm doing only your recipes ahaha)
0:30 can you imagine the amount of pressure you'd be in to cook for Laura Vitale?? I'd be sweating buckets!!
Awesome. Thank you.
You forgot the episode number :)
😘😘😘👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Yummy
Little pinch of sugar and a little salt??? Think you got that backwards! 😂😂😂 love you Laura!
You can make crepes without flour...with cream cheese, eggs, vanilla extract, and protein powder.
Hi Laura. It looks good. Can you show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps
0:31 “Mom can you start the oven?? We’re having a guest!”
Thank you!
Always a masterclass 🖤🙌🙌
I am going to make this asap!
I love crepes and even better with berries!! 💖💖💖
Laura you have to try savory chicken crepes,  any kind of shredded chicken even canned, mix with little mayo and garlic and mozzarella cheese, fill the crepes and bake for couple minutes for the cheese to melt, sooo good!
This is my first Mother’s Day without my mama:( I will make this for my family and we will cheers to her and send the love up to the sky❤️
😍💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 delectable 👌love how you keep your recipes versatile.
Stick to cooking Laura, it's not about your wild weirdo attitude
That looks yummy 🤗
My goodness Laura 
I'm making this for Sunday breakfast, on your written recipe it says "4 of cream cheese" ?? 4 of what! Cream cheese.
4 packages?? 4 cups??
Noway that's 4 ozs
Looks so tasty!
Make a carne asada crepe pleaseeee!
how big is that red cup ,that you are using for batter?
Awesome delicious
Yum 😋❤️
It looks easy to make, I have to try this 😊
What does she have the temp set to? Low?
Looks delicious!
Looks really good
Can you please make beef lasagna with barbecue sauce? Thanks a lot
Was lowkey hoping Mia would show up :( we want her in more of your videos!
I’m making this for Mother’s Day. Thanks Laura.
🧡❤️❤️💜❤️❤️💛
Well I know what I'm making for breakfast tomorrow!!!!! 😛❤
I am so hungry from watching this video.  Crepes look delicioso....Yum
Yummmyyyyyyy😍😍😍😍😍
Laura you know these are pancakes! 🤣🤣
“WHOOO AM I!?!?” 😂😂😂😂😂
😻
Hey Laura! Do you have a good Chipped Beef recipe? I’ve been craving it for a while and was wondering if you’ve ever had it, or made it before.
This looks like Christmas 😍
Could I make these in a Cast iron pan?
Yum
Did you reheat the crepes before assembling because I noticed you blew on it but you made them a bit prior. Figured it is habit now 😂
I know what I’m making myself on my first Mother’s Day! 😍😍😍
Delicious
👍👍
Cream cheese rules
Do you speak Italian to Mia sometimes?☺️🤗🇮🇹
cream cheese danish please !!!
Yummy looks so good
delicious
forse le piace il cibo dolce
Yes savory crepes!!!!!! So delicious!!!
I always suck at making my crepes thin like that so a trick I learned was to dip the bottom of your pan into the batter and just cook it over the stove upside down. Lol
omg berries crepe YUMMM
How come ur not in any food channel  Laura
Here in Norway, you will find crepes with Gravlaks and scramble eggs. Often with some thyme or basil. It's really really good. Just make the crepes a little salty. There crepes looks amazing. Thank you so much! Enjoy your weekend! Hugs from Norway.
The crepes look delicious! As a chocoholic, I would definitely eat these with Nutella and crushed Ferrero rocher chocolates 😀
I’m trying to be healthy and here I am, watching this, torturing myself 😭😭
About how long do these last on the fridge?
Yumm
She so hot !!
Yummy
Yummy
Yummy
ive been watching your vids since i was like 10, im now 14 and i still looove your content! <3
SAVORY CREPES ARE MY FAVE! chicken Florentine pleaseeeeee I would trade my SOUL to be taught how to make savory delicious chicken Florentine crepes with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, cheeses that I don’t know and  smooth buttery hollandaise type sauce on top OMG I’m going to get a snack I’m making myself hungry lol! Love you and please send me some prayers I am 2 weeks out of my 4th SPINE SURGERY! This is fusion #2 and I had the first fusion 6 months ago 🤕😰🙏❤️ sending love and happy Easter! I hope maybe you can put clips somewhere of the baby egg hunting!
What is the epesode?
Love your show how long will the batter last in the fridge?
Very good  Laura
If you do venture into savoury crêpe territory, you should make a complète which is ham, gruyère and an egg. A Breton classic. And judging by how proficient you seem to be with French recipes as seen in other videos, I’d bet you’d do a complète justice 😛
Yummyyy
Hi Laura on the cream cheese filling 4 of cream cheese? 4 of what ?table spoon or cups?
Didn't watch it yet, but liked it anyway. Cheese blintzes, yum
I’m going to make these tomorrow morning....I’m gonna weigh 600 pounds by the time I watch all your videos.
Finn
nice and yummy
D
Please have Mia in more of your videos she's literally the cutest baby evaaa
Great, just what I was looking for. Simple yet  easy to follow recipe.
Delicious but where  can I see  the  how many cups of  flour , milk  etc please
I dont think ive EVER seen Laura make something that didn't look unbelievably delicious! Its almost as if i can taste how good it is. What a talented chef! 💞
I love what i am seeing. But being a vegetarian  i cannot have eggs, so is there any substitute for eggs?
loved your Michael Jackson scream lol
🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰
It look soooooo delicious
Note to self:  Become Laura's BFF by any means necessary   :)
Thats too heavy for a crepes..crepes are light
yuum lauara i love ur recipies
Love it..is it ok to half the recipe tho
"And"!!!!!!!! You scared me by saying this,  You really are a freak
These are so beautiful! Is def do a bit of Nutella somewhere in there as well hehe. I’m with you, I really love savory crepes, too. I can’t wait to see your version! ❤️
I wish you would start  telling us what to replace eggs with, just in case of allergic people. 
Thank you
Looks so good. Making these tomorrow! Thanks Laura. Been using so many of your recipes and just love them.
😋😋😋😋
I always make crepes at home. But I usually fill them with Nutella, banana and strawberries :P
Laura with summer coming up I was wondering if you could make a video for a pink lemonade cake??
Why aren't these cooked enough? Why isn't the butter browned? 
Why is the batter too thick? And heavy ?
This is at best a hybrid, between a pancake and a crepe.

C'est une insulte à la crêpe française et aux bretons, mon dieu !  Heureusement qu'ils ne se sont pas attaqués aux galettes au sarrasin ! Pfiou
Can you make Cherry Pie milkshake?
Why do we see so little of the food and so much of the chef?
واو رائع
I take out salmon out of my freezer to cook and I was thinking how to cook it and here we go Laura in the kitchen with the best recipe

Hi Laura, fantastic I like that salmon recipe.  On point ....honey yumm
Perfection. So easy
🤤🤤🤤🤤  👌
Yummy in my tummy:) :p
Mmm!!!
yeah guys im calling it now, I think lauras pregnant again, I can tell shes out of breath like before and im noticing a tiny bit of bunching by the belly under her apron :)
Hi, Laura. I love your show and the idea of this salmon recipe, but I need to point out that wild salmon and farmed salmon cook differently. Wild may need only 5-7 minutes or it may get too chalky. Internal temps (according to Kenji Lopez-Alt) should be 122F for wild and 125-127 for farmed. I have done his experiments, too, and find the readings to be accurate. Just trying to be helpful.
The baking try looks pretty full so I forgive you for not inviting me to share, just!
My mouth was watering too.
😋😋❤️🧡💛
👋🏻!!!
PERFEZIONE!
my mouth is watering! great recipe! always looks yummy!
Looks good! 👍
😄😍 stay awesome!!
Looks so ridiculously good!
Delicious
are you ever gonna film LITK in your actual kitchen? i see it on instagram and it's beautiful!
I didn’t have salmon but I just sautéed some chicken in that marinade plus a little of the fajita seasoning and it was so divine!  Thanks for a great meal!  This was my first time watching a recipe on YouTube and I’m definitely hooked and I’ll be coming back for more great recipes!
Super chef
hey i know this isn’t relevant but i clicked to watch this video, and i don’t watch your videos as often as i did at some point of my life but i just had a drunk flashback of someone at a party talking about one of your recipes and all i remember is me talking non stop “hi guys i’m laura vitale and on this episode of laura in the kitchen” hahaha sorry

From Len - Philippines 🇵🇭
Where's the recipe, tryna make these rnn 😩
Laura, I don't know if you've ever had them, but fajitas molcajete are SOOOO good. They are out of this world, I've been wanting to make them at home and I'd loveeee to see your take! 😊

It looks good Laura. Can you do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps.
💘thank you so much for this recipe!🤩
recipe looks great but your makeup girl  😍😍
Such a great recipe for those left-over bananas! My daughter is just like Mia, loves bananas but doesn't want anything to do with them once they are a little ripe. Thanks for this video!
Hello Laura love your recipes.always try them they are delicious.
Excellent recipe. We will try to make a greeting from Canada.
Freaking GENIUS idea!! Like what?! Why! How?! The only thing that sucks about this is that I have to wait till after Easter/lent to make these! Or maybe even Easter Sunday. But either way, this WILL be happening 😍😍😍
Looks delicious, great video as usual ❤
Laura, I've a quick question for you for this recipe. My question is can you use frozen bananas for this banana bread blondies recipe?
I was actually waiting for banana blondies 😲 They look delicious! I was also thinking of doing a mix of those and the banana poke cake 🤤
The brown butter and sugar mixture didn't work for me. It just ended up crystallizing after it cooled instead of staying as a liquid like hers.
So. Much. Butter. So. Much. Sugar. These must be heavenly! You know I'm going to make them! 🤤
Has anybody tried this? Seems a bit sweet...
Is it blasphemous if I added white chocolate into the mix?
I cant wait to try them! thank u
You should make Oreo blondies
easy peasy! looks Devine#
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
Every time I see that sweet baby girl I think she looks like a miniature you Laura. Love you bunches and bunches.
Thank you Laura.
Yum! Nailed it once again!

Werq, Laura!
Hi Laura, Could you please share a few portable brunch-for-a-crowd recipes? My friends and I have been doing monthly potluck brunches and I'd like to do something other than muffins and breads. Sweet or savory suggestions are welcome! :)
Yeey😘
Can you please make posole?
AMAZING IDEA
I love banana bread, great idea for blondies! Thanks!
I’m trying this
❤️
👍👍👍
I love your recipes...i hope you write your ingredients down here...
Made these last night!! Oh my goddess!! So delicious!! That icing!!! What else would you suggest putting that icing on besides a spoon? Haha!! I will be giving these bars away, or else the entire pan will be gone by noon today! 🤣
I made this and took it to the church potluck on Sunday. I added nuts to the mix and some on top.  The blondies disappeared in 1 minute.I brought them to the table but had forgotten the serving spatula so I went to the kitchen but by time I got back they were already gone. . Next time I will not put a note on the side saying Laura in the Kitchen recipe. My bad. LOL
Yum!
If you omit the egg, will this recipe still work like banana bread does? (Allergy reasons). This sounds amazing.
Wow.! Look sooo good! Need to see Mia on the show she's adorabls.
Wow
Can you please show how to make homemade vanilla extract ? 🙏🏼😋😛
Not going to lie I don’t think I’ve ever had Blondies

Do people really think her name is Lauren?! Her page says “Laura In the kitchen” everywhere 😂
Just made this for lunch and my wife says that this goes in the "keeper" recipe file and that I can make it anytime I want!  Happy wife happy life!  Thank you so much for sharing your culinary skills with us!  :)
I love a one pan / pot dinner
More specifically, harissa is from Tunisia 🇹🇳
we have a winter special mutton recipe called harissa in kashmir. An absolute delicacy.❤
If you don't like the spice take the paste from 1 tablespoon to 1 tablespoon and it will be perfect
Your videos always fill my heart with joy and happiness
I always have a smile on my face when I’m watching one of your videos!!
Harissa ya hobi 😃 it's from north Africa, Tunisia in particular and yes it is so hot 🌶🌶  🏴🏴
Laura , finally Middle Eastern food , I love every video u are funny down to earth and amazing cook 👩‍🍳 ❤️
Laura looking poppin in this episode🔥🔥🔥
Harissa = Tunisia 🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳🇹🇳
This is awesome, thanks Laura:-)♥ (now I'm hungry♥)
"If you don't like things spicy, take it from one tablespoon of the paste to one tablespoon of paste" 


Laura making sure you do it spicy!! lol
Hi, I am loren from Italy.I like your recipe
Love it! thanks for sharing one pot dinner...
I have to that the quality of your videos have become amazing!! I've been following you almost from the start and when I watch older videos it's worlds of a difference! Kudos!
Harissa is a Tunisian hot chili pepper paste, the main ingredients of which are roasted red peppers, Baklouti pepper, serrano peppers, and other hot chili peppers, spices and herbs such as garlic paste, coriander seed, saffron, rose, or caraway, as well as some vegetable or olive oil to carry the oil-soluble flavors
In Hebrew you call it אריסה
I keep expecting you to, at one point during tasting to say, "forget about it!". LOL! Once again, you killed it Laura!
I love how you repeated your name to make sure people get it correct. Ive been doing it for year, I know how you feel 😁 The chicken looks delicious  😋😊
We get in Mumbai, India as well..and I absolutely love harissa chicken... Thanks for the recipe
Never heard of this dish but looks good  and glad that you shared with us!! 💖
Hi I had a hard time finding Harissa paste. I made the recipe with similar sauce, still delicious. Thanks Laura, chicken was great.

Absolutely beautiful!
This looks absolutely delicious. Thanks you.
Why don't u use a garlic press?
Laura in the kitchen you’re a wonderful cook:)
If she aint the absolute cutest 😭😭 this looks so good laura i look forward to making it. Its funny, in saudi we have a dish called harissa but it has absolutely nothing to do with the spice 😂 its just cause in arabic harissa means mushed and the dish has ingredients finely ground together. Now i wouldnt mind a lamb shank recipe 👀🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️
5:49 story of my life as well 😂
Looks devine, thanks for sharing. Can pearl red onions be used as well?
Can you do like a cooking episode and then a mukbang afterwards?

Has anyone else noticed she is bubbly and goofy more lately? Yes I know she has always been but it just seems to have kicked up a notch. You can tell how truly happy she is and its amazing.

You need to try this with Moroccan preserved lemons. Pulp in the marinade and skin with the veggies.

Hi
What that paste is made of?
You're so funny! Bring back your make-up tutorials!
Hello Laura in the kitchen ha ha
On a scale of 1 to 10, how spicy is this?
Very good nice
Wow very yummmy
Omg that does look amazing,  I know what's for dinner tomorrow night.  Thank you thank you thank you !
Making me hungry again. I’m gaining weight just watching your videos!
You baked it
I will be on the lookout for harissa paste.
Laura in the Kitchen .. You didn't say it right near the end  at 8:46 .. " If you don't want it overly spicey then take it down from one tablespoon to one tablespoon ?
where do you get the harissa paste? any brand recommendations?
This sounds great! Can’t wait to try it with my necessary modifications (I’m allergic to allium - onions, garlic, shallots, scallions, chives). I’ll bet you wouldn’t know how to make a meal without them, haha.
Can’t find the Harissa Paste. Would the powder type work by mixing it with olive oil ???
cool video that looks yummy
hi loala in the kitchen!
Loren... Laura...😶😐😕😟😵
This looks AMAZING! And so simple! Thanks Laura!
Kindly speak less n work more
i feel like her love for laura in the kitchen is disappearing ... she's not as enthusiastic and excited as before ... her views and likes have gone down so much ....
I think we all agree that Mia can be in every one of your videos until the end of time and we will always love it! It’s so fun watching her grow up over the last two years on your show.
"I will eat this on my shoe laces" hahhahaa I love laura
What are you trying to do to me woman? 😂 😂

“Soften at room temperature”
I throw mine at the microwave for 5 sec interval and call it a day.
Ain’t nobody got time for that
Can you make a vanilla cake dip
Ok I’ve heard chocolate hummus is good but I’m skeptical, test a recipe and let us know! 😁
Only Laura can bring amazing unique recipes 💜 and always a classy twist to it
Can't you just imagine how yummy that would taste on an Apple slice, on a banana or on a strawberry?
Mmmm I know what I’m making this weekend! 😋 Thanks Laura Laura!
Pretty sure this is the equivalent of dipping in cream cheese icing 🤣
Yes we totally love Mia she’s your mini you! She Couldn’t be cuter..
For those of us who grew up on Dunkaroos. 🤤😍

💯 Simply the queen. 👌No other words to describe this woman. She's perfect in every way
I use your videos with my 5th graders to teach math skills. We’ve used your apple dumpling recipe for calculating 10x greater and less and we used this one for fractions. They beg just to watch them!

HEALTHIER Recipes Please!
Brownie batter dip!
That baby must've had some great food while you were pregnant and now lol
I feel like this recipe needs like a flour type component to give it that slightly gritty cookie dough texture. I would suggest some almond flour or oat flour or ground graham crackers.
Yummy 😋 great recipe for Easter ty
Looks so yummy😃
Texas Lady😊

It looks sooo good! I'd love to dip strawberries in this!
Very nice recipe👌👌👌👌👌
Oo!  I know a dip that may be too sweet, but still sounds like a good idea: Oreo dip!  Oo!  And I bet you could blend anything up with whipped cream to make a dip!
Laura Vitale, I've a recipe request for you that I really want you to make. And its can you make an oreo cheesecake dip here on Laura in the Kitchen? This is a recipe that I came up with since you've not made before, it's really surprisingly and shockingly.
Tiramisu cheesecake dip
WHERE IS MIA?!?! #BRINGMIABACK
Mmmmm.  This looks so good!  I'd be tempted when I pulled it out of the fridge to scoop into little egg shapes and coat in melted chocolate...cookie dough Easter eggs.
This looks so delicious! 😀
Things like make it hard for me to diet
Oreo dip... PLEASE!!!

Love to see Mia in the kitchen more.

Chocolate chip cream cheese frosting
More episodes of Mia in the kitchen!
OMG, mo’ Mia, mo’ betterrrr!! 💕

Laura you have done it again, i have made your cookie  dough cheesecake it was amazing now i have to make this ❤❤

Yes please have Mia in every episode I think everyone enjoys watching her in the kitchen
Oh my goodness, my 5 & 7 y/o grandsons would L♥VE THIS! PLUS, they love to cook so it would be perfect to make with them.  I love seeing Mia in the kitchen with you, she is adorable and clearly, she is her mother's daughter with a "spatul-er" or spoon in her hand! You can see she is in her element! ♥
Sweet hummus!!! I’ve seen chocolate and red velvet hummus but I’m afraid to buy it!!!
Giiirrl, Id eat that off a toilet seat! It reminds me of Dunkaroo's!! You rock :)
Wow watching at midnight getting hungry why am I torturing myself anyway Mia is the cutest baby evaa
Always enjoying your videos ... the world needs more of you. Myself included 😊
it's not the same without little mia valentina!
You should make dunkaroo dip!!!!
Looks yummy! Think you could make homemade perogies? :)
So good on vanilla wafers. I use the mini ones. You can make a little sandwich out of them with the dip in the middle
Laura!! That looks so delicious 😋 💕 I luv cookie dough ice cream I’m sure I’ll enjoy this recipe!
Mia in the Kitchen!!
Watcha doin', Laura? Trying to lose some weight over here! xD
You’re so amazing and thanks for not double dipping!
Finally a cookie dough dip with NO flour!! Definitely saving this for a girls night! Could you do like some sort of "Neapolitan dip" like the ice cream, a chocolate vanilla and strawberry section? Maybe make it extra special and do like  a french vanilla, chocolate espresso and raspberry versions (or some variation?) 😍😍
Another wonderful recipe Laura thank you! Next.. would you consider a cherry version of your apple hand pie?
Yes....We would love to see Mia in the Videos....
I would like to know with the cookie dough dip could you replace the brown sugar and put in white sugar or could I use Splender or equal please text me back and let me know
Seeing Mia every week?! That would be so awesome! Please do that Laura!
This is the Keto fat bombs. All you have to do is use a sugar substitute and use the sugar-free chocolate chips or dark chocolate chunks.
Cookie dough dip!! Oh my god......
I really struggle to understand why this is called cookie dough dip? What does it make cookie dough specifically? I think it is just delicious cream cheese and chocolate chip dip though.
Have you made a curry dish ?
Yummmmzzzzzz
Thanks for the idea! I have cream cheese that needs to be used up and graham crackers that need to be eaten. Though I've always wanted cookie dough minus the chocolate chips.
Absolutely Mia can stay, I love her in the kitchen with you! She's so cute!!! Rename it Laura and Mia in the Kitchen. 💕
My 5 year old loves to help me cook and she will absolutely love this!
Ugh! I’ve been craving cookie dough throughout my whole entire pregnancy 😩 . I want to make this but I’m not sure if this would be safe for me to eat. Looks amazing though!
Aaaaahhhhh yes to Mia being in the kitchen!!!!!!☺️☺️☺️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💕
I am afraid you daughter will fall off hr stand,,,I am worry wart,,,lol. Do what makes you feel good and safe
So this is similar to a cream cheese buttercream icing...except you have added heavy cream and less confectioners sugar. What a great and easy to remember recipe. :) i will definitely make this for a party in the future.
Can't find the recipe I even searched for it please help
Yes please bring in Mia i world love to see more of her gorgeous little face. That cookie dough dip would be dangerous around me 🤭😩🙈😍
Can’t find the recipe hon can you help me. Thank you
YES BRING MIA OUT . 😩 I love seeing her in your videos

My hips are wishing I hadn't seen this video.  My stomach is saying, Yesssss!
🌸Of course yes you should have Mia in that kitchen. My daughter’s name is Nia and we love cooking together also. 🌸
Laura it looks really good the only thing that would make it better if I can eat it off of you preferably in your neck region are your nether regions down below

Jimin is a member of the korean band BTS and there is a meme from a few years ago, where another member said “he had no jams” and jimin didnt understand them as he doesn’t speak english.

Wow this looks unbelievable! Definitely making this for dinner! My mouth was watering when she cut the chicken haha.

I love how the newest video is exactly the same as the first. So professional!
Almost as Aussie accent there! 😂
Delicious as always!!
Thank you for the Keto recipe. Will definitely make this recipe soon.

I love you Laura . Girl I’m so making this on Sunday Dinner
Laura, here’s a question. When you going to teach us how to do that burnt cheesecake I told you about? I’m waiting for your creation. 😍
This channel is excellent- I never thought a member of the Panucci crime family would ever amount to anything, but she done good #Crime #Laura #Mafioso
love you so much Laura, you really light up my day <3 have a good day
Your side joke! Haha! 😂💋
♥:-) I've been craving jalapeno, this is perfect, thanks Laura♡♥
The man married to Laura has to be the 2nd luckiest man in the world next to me. I've done had 4 relationships while watching Lura in the Kitchen spanning a few different cultures, and 3 out of 4 have become jealous of my affection for this channel. I really just love the food and the art of it. Thank you for all you do. Best of luck to you and the hubby.
Modt enjoyable video yet! Thanks!
😂😂You are too funny! I love it!! This recipe will make me think of keto! Definitely will try this.
delicious, Laura, I like your red saucepans :)
You can just tell Laura is a super organised person in general. . .and so happy. Wish i could be like that.

Can you make some Whole30 friendly recipes?
That looks amazing and sounds so freaking crunchy and delicious!! You’re killing me, Laura!!
Wine for apps? Chicken poppers for dinner!
I admire so many things about you. One of them is the enthusiasm about what you do in episode 1337... it is the same enthusiasm you had in episode 1!!! I think that is one of the main things that make people love you so much. Thank you.
I bet Laura’s house always smells amazing
Your personality is everything! You're so personable and funny. You make cooking fun. Definitely going to be making this once I get over this cold 🤧

Your Jimin rant made me LOL. Jimin is a member of the kpop band BTS. And there's a joke in the fandom because one of the other members said "Jimin, you got no jams." If you happen to score him coming to your house for dinner, give me an invite too! :P
Yep,looks good
🤣🤣🤣 you are so funny! 😂😂😂 I love you 👌
indeed we've been friends from a very long, but have never seen you go this crazy for your own food.😂😂😂
11:37 That ending was great. I made these for a party recently and everyone loved them. Thanks Laura!
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
Hahaha just to answer your question , jimin is a person . He is one of the 7 guys in a kpop group , BTS .
Man, and I thought I was bad at accents ;) Pop that sucker in my mouth, looks so good!!!
Love love watching your videos. Even if it’s something I wouldn’t personally make, I still watch because I just love your personality.
Winner winner Laura's Chicken dinner id have with just a couple of boiled potatoes on the side I'll be making this for sure
I made this today (minus the bacon) and it turned out really great!  Next time I will wrap it in bacon so the filling seeps out less while baking. Thanks - my lunches are going to be awesome this week!
Omg that looks so yummy.  Like how it all came together.
I love her goofy personality!!
can I use a cast iron skillet?
Love this recipe! I have people coming over that are lactose intolerant next month. Any recommendations for substitutions?
Love your food, but...not so much that ponytail (sorry about it)
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻linda 😘🙏🏻
I love your channel! You’re so talented and funny. I’m definitely making this!
Watching this at 3am and I want to eat Olive Garden now

Looks mouthwatering!
Please make a buffalo/ranch pasta please! With options of chicken or no chicken. Thanks Laura!
I gotta try this. Looks delicious!
Lol at that intro!!!!
I love you and your family
Great recipe but you might consider that parts from a normal chicken are not that huge! That chicken was feed hormones.

Indian recipes please!
Hi Laura!the jalapeno chicken looks so good it would be good for rice or pasta.love you.You are my favorite.im glad you are on the cooking channel you deserves it.💖😙😗😚😘💞💞💕💕💋💋
Hey Laura my name is Tyler and I have panic attack disorder I'm 27 and I have been watching you now for years I'm gay also by the way but I love watching your cooking shows it really helps with my anxiety and I've even made at least over 15 of your dishes and I just want to say things to you because you have really helped me now with just cooking LOL but also my anxiety if you want just to acknowledge that you got this which would be absolutely mind-blowing My email is stormwarningwithin@gmail.com and thank you very much
What would be a good side for the chicken
My mom makes something very similar, except instead of jalapeños she uses red bell pepper, and instead of bacon she uses prosciutto, so incredible!
2:49 that Italian hand
Look so delicious. Gonna make tomorrow for lunch😍😍 thanks Laura for sharing😘😘😘
That looks so good. Yummy.
😂😂😂😂
ur amazing
I think that Jimin is the one from BTS, Chim Chim!✨
I'm hungry now
My house hold loves poppers I’m going to give this a shot thanks for showing how it’s done and love all your videos
My favorite part of every episode is (at the end of her cooking segment) when Laura starts to speed talk so she can hurry up to enjoy the first bite of her masterpiece. Especially on the episodes where she can't hardly wait by nearly burning her mouth every time. That's how you know  the food is good. She's an impatient foodie and I love it!! Respect! 🙌
hi LAURA THANK YOU FOR NEW RECIPE
Nice recipe. Needs less talking
This looks so delicious 😍 I can’t wait to try it!!
I made this for dinner tonight and I’ve never been so happy that I made a double batch of anything. This is so good!
I gotta make this
Love it!
cooked this tonight. delicious!
I think it’s BTS Laura or Bangtansonyeondan Jimin is vocalist but also one of the top dancer in the THE biggest male Korean group. They’re worldwide famous just google him you’ll see not sure what strawberry jam has to do with him though.
You are so funnying Laura
You are the best.
Yummy 😋 gonna make this asap
Marry me 😜
That looks really good....
Lovely😍😍😍😍love from india❤❤❤💞💞
Ur what every woman wants to be lol
U are an inspiration to all well done and ur accent is to die for xx
nope - not in my house - that feeds one person per breast lol
I do not care about keto. I do care that this is a great looking recipe and I cannot wait to try it.
Love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi sweet Laura. I love your recipes but could it be possible that your recipes and then come in grams and ml Since it is very difficult to convert I do not think that your recipes will be as fantastic as they should hope it something you want to think about many thanks for many good hours
Can you cook this in the instapot ?
Never mind keto....i would make some rice and have it with this delicious chicken 😊
where is mini me  🤔🤔🤔
Can you make a desert with air heads
I'm def making this this weekend for dinner with some sweet potato fries and additional veggies. Thanks Laura for all the awesome and easy recipes! It makes cooking more fun and rewarding when pretty much almost all of your recipes (I'm gluten free so I never really got to try any of your dessert recipes = less calories lol) come out delicious or "better than restaurant quality", my boyfriend states sometimes 😂
Im hungry now
🤤🤤🤤
imagine this over a bed of zoodles with sauteed bell peppers & onions.... like the keto version of a "skilletini"  

(something they had on the menu at johnny carino's, basically a surprisingly delicious italian-mexican fusion i guess)
Delish!!! you'r funny. Love this kind of videos. make life  more colorful. GO GIRL...
😋😋😋 delicious 😋 😋 😋!!!!
Can you use chiken thigh?
Hahahah I love how the ending of your videos get sillier
😂
😋
Jimmins lmfaooo
Your personality is so fun! 😄
This looks great and flavorful!
Looks delicious
Hello
Do I have to use bacon
I’m genuinely curious as to why she says “spatulur”? 😝
Beautiful, witty and a wonderful cook.. whata combination.  Thanks Laura.. MORE KETO
😊
You and Maangchi are the reason why I am fat !!!
WOW so yummy
Watching this as an vegetarian.. that’s how much I love you Laura!
I mean you say serves two....i wouldn't share that with anyone! 😅😳
This looks so yummy.
Laura, you’re such a riot!! This recipe looks golden—I can’t tolerate jalapeños because of their spiciness. So, how would poblanos be as a substitute?
you are absolutely the best.
I made this tonight for dinner, it was SO yummy. The sauce was a great touch to finish the dish off.
Love the little video in the start❤️
You’re amazing Laura!
I just made this. I had thick bacon so it didn’t stay wrapped around the chicken; none of the filling fell out while sautéing so I didn’t have any of it for the sauce; I cut the chicken too far through; I didn’t have heavy cream & whole milk so I used Half&half; I had filling left over; I used only 1 of the 4 jalapeños I bought AND it fell apart taking it out of the pan.All this being said, it is one of the most delicious chicken recipes I’ve ever made.
how can we make it without the bacon?
I wouldn't say this is completely Keto...I would lose the milk to make it keto compliant...still amazing ...
Can you tell us what to serve with this chicken recipe
Hello cutie  pie
laura.... stop making me crazy and making water out of my mouth seeing you eating your food that waay....
Beautiful Food & Beautiful Laura ♥️🕊💫🍷Thank you
Looks yummy.
I thought porn wasn’t allowed on YouTube.
Hi Laura... looks delish..but what can I substitute  instead of the bacon?
I make soo many of your recipes, Ty
Made this tonight for dinner, quick and easy! We had to bake an extra ten minutes or so at 375. I’d double the sauce recipe next time only because it’s so tasty!
If I used a sheet to bake these rather than a pan, should I preheat the sheet before I pop them in?
Could someone please tell me what is the  brand of this pan ?I would like order one:)Thank you!
to cook and eat like that is impressive, i have to hide it from Lana, she's on salad, i don't want to upset her, but at the same time i want to eat massive hamburger!
Ahhh! I’m fasting right now for lent so no meat or dairy but best believe after Easter his will be getting made in mah housseeee
Awesome video!!
I tried this today.... it's awesome.  A few tips for the next time I make this:  Roll the bacon all in the same direction, overlapping a bit, and be sure when you turn the chicken in the trying pan to go with the direction of the roll so that it's less likely to pull off the bacon, espeically as it wanted to stick to the pan I was using.  One breast held together, the other I messed up, and it fell off.   At one point I almost forgot about that frying pan had come fresh out of the oven hot... so put something over the handle when making the sauce.
Sorry but I don't eat bacon
Black peppa
I have an issue with frying them on the pan. It always burns or whatever. Can I just leave them in the oven at the start?
Jimin is an idol / singer from BTS 😍😍😍😍 Yeah you should invite him...and film it 😍😍😍 
ARMY WERE U @?
Mic drop but not really cause its expensive LMAO
Laura. I don't believe you could ever make a bad recipe!, I went to my dictionary and marked through the wore DYNAMIC  amd replaced it with the ultimate word LAURA. My mom's name was Laura and that tells me I'll never forget yours. Just the name Laura makes me hungry and my mom was a wonderful cook also.
LOL! I love it:))
Just for your health Laura, I don't think heating olive oil at high heats is that good for you
For those asking for more keto recipes, just eat items with highest fat content. Steaks, cheese, bacon, ice cream. Don’t eat veggies, yuk. Sounds like a healthy diet.
Haha I feel like this lady knows how to cook literally everything.
My problem is this: who has room in the freezer to put that tray in 😟🤦‍♀️
Cousin Laura we are loving these INTROS! Keep them coming!
I would really like to see a bread pudding recipe that you make.
Excellent as ALWAYS Laura!👍🤗💚💖💖😋 God bless you, your Family, your Channel and your work!!❤❤❤🙂😊
These look delicious! Raspberries are one of my favourite fruits 😊
These are traditional finnish pastry on christmas time. Although we use plum jam =)
I'm going to Las Vegas in a couple of weeks, I'll try the cheese danish at the Bellagio 😊 thanks for the recommendation!!
I tried this and was surprised that it turned out great, only because I followed your directions exactly. Great chef but even more amazing is that you give fantastic directions. Food Network would be lucky to have you as a regular show. Please keep up the great shows.
Laura knows the gateway to my heart... Is through my stomach😉💗🥐
Wife suggested using a pizza cutter to cut the dough.
Hello Laura, you’re the best you have some great recipes thanks.
Laura, I'm going to make these savory with tomato basil jam and sprinkle chives on top after baking.  I'm thinking for Easter Brunch.  Thanks for getting my brain thinking.
Our beautiful queen of the kitchen always says that her baking/decorating skills are not good...and then she posts pics of her delectable desserts sprinkled with fairy dust and I’m ashamed to repeat the recipe bc it will never look as good 😂
You had me at cheesecake.  😋
Will there be anymore Simply Laura episodes?!
Yummy!! We thank you Laura.❤✌
Well I was going to ask about a video on making puff pastry until 1:37. 😂
Your intro though 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Laura do you have a recipe on how you make the Vanilla?
Wow. Love it 🇻🇳😘
I guess that notification bell really does work. 💞😊
Omg thank you for the recipe! I'm going to make these later this evening but I think I may try BlackBerry
Yuuuuum!!! Deff going to give these a try with the kiddos
Could you provide your recipe for your vanilla extract 😍
Laura loves law and order. So do I.
Love all your recipes, can you also have gluten free options for those who cannot eat gluten.
My Wife and I Stayed at The Presidential Suite At the Bellagio . Amazing Experience. Las Vegas has the worlds Best Restaurants.
Laura ur personality is everything
Um I’m making these today and that’s final!!
"What is this? ....  parchment paper" Made me laugth so much. I really can relate 😂
One of my favorite recipes!!
The best I've had were from Olsen's Danish Village Bakery in Solvang, CA.
You could also make this with lemon. Sooo goood!!
why does Mia do a better job than me when it comes to doing nails? 🤔🤔 slightly jealous😂
These look delicious! I've never used puff pastry. I can't wait to try these!
We make these on Christmas in Finland with plum jam or marmelade :)
First time ive seen her/this channel.  Those look amazing and pretty simple, im sure thid will look like an impressive dish if you take somewhere 
Ima try this recipe!!
Nup, I was right in Copenhagen where I tried all the best Danish pastries!! And I make these with strawberry jam as raspberries aren't available where I come from 😭
Super dear😍😍😍😍Love from india
Is danish usually made with puff pastry? Is there a traditional pastry dough you can do a recipe for? I would love to make these from scatch, but I've made puff pastry once and never will again!
Yaaaaaas l&o. Can never go wrong with that show 🤣
I'm definitely going to make those danishes and raspberries are my favorite fruit so that excites me!
Hey tyvm for sharing looks so good im  assuming you can use whatever jam you like?
I agree! I
Love their danishes.
Oh gosh those look amazing for sure 😍😍🤤
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
best cheese i ever tried  
in cotija     mexico           cotija cheese is amazing
Law and order is the best !!!! Season 14!! 😂
10.34 p.m and I just wathed this video. I'll go to sleep dreaming with one of these with a nice cup of coffee.
Awww man I could of done this with my fresh blackberries well now I know when I have blackberries or other berries I can use this recipe
Amazing and so simple 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
I literally had my best cherry danish literally this morning because I went to Solvang California yesterday and brought home a box of danishes.  It was sooooo good. I will try this recipe for sure because I want more.
I have a big ziplock bag of red raspberries that I froze and now I don't know any recipes beside jam
Do you have a video on how you make your own vanilla extract?
Love that ❤ i am in need for that
These, I will most definitely make!!
I noticed the cream cheese filling had spread.....in a good way!!
These look good and love her sweater! 😎
Hi Laura. How r you? It looks yummy. Can you show us how to do donuts stuffed with custard? Thank you heaps
You look fabulous and I so my favorite cream cheese and raspberry or blueberry thank you so much I wish I could have a bite of them if I get a chance to make him I have to let you know thank you again for sharing♡
Vous êtes la meilleure 😘🌷👍
Wow, I need to make these
Surprisingly I actually did have a cheese danish in the middle of Paris
I'm with you.  Only eat four!
I just have to make these!!!  Thank you, Laura!
Delicious I shall try . Thank you so much Laura.
وصفة جميلة اتمنى لك التوفيق والنجاح 👍👍👍
Thankfully i forgot the vanilla in my first batch, because the 2 tsp of vanilla extract is SO overpowering. I enjoyed it much better with just the cream cheese, sugar and egg yolk.
Keep the camera still, please, and show what she’s doing, not her standing there talking!
Laura start a mukbang channel😆
Interesting! We have similar looking pastries here in Finland during Christmas! The only difference is that they have plum marmalade (or alternatively apple marmalade) in the middle. :)
At Disney world!! They were everyday thing for breakfast
Never had a cheese danishe
This looks so good and fairly easy ... my favorite Danish is from L & M Bakery in Delran, NJ ... their Coconut Danish is my absolute favorite ... and their butter cake is to die for ... now that I live in North Carolina I have only the memories of this amazing bakery. Love watching your videos, Laura ... I have made many of your recipes over the years ... We really like your Lasagna & my daughter has done justice in making your Cinnamon Rolls. Nice to see your charming daughter at the beginning of your videos.
2:12 Sweetheart, you will be eating the same amount whether you cut it into small or large pieces....
Can't we freeze the cream cheese filling before we place it on the pastry dough? It might be helpful for the people who don't have a freezer space.
Looks great! I hope it works out with other jams as well, but why shouldn't it?:)
Oh lovely! I love raspberries.
Best? 7-11 on P’cola beach 😂
Lovely dish😍😍
i want to make this right now but the recipe isn’t on laura in the kitchen yet! 😭
i mean... law and order svu is awesome tho
Great recipe!
How do you make your own vanilla
😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Totally trying this ASAP. Looks so delish!
Great recipe. I can’t wait to make these. What type of counters do you have that you cut the puff pastry without a cutting board. Did you scratch your counter?
Totally making these this weekend but only making 2 for my boyfriend and I! Thx Laura for another great recipe
I baked four forty years there called pinwheels nice job
This looks so good
I just realized that she is left handed.

how do you make your own vanilla?
Hey laura here in Africa we love you
Looks good.
Best danish I had was at Tommy’s Pastries down the street from me. It’s actually a croissant with danish filling, but it’s still a danish and it could cure depression, it’s that good. And only $1.50 each for a very generous portion
I'm very poor can I use imitation vanilla extract?
Oooo, they look good
Hello mylove
I’m making these along with the video and My cream cheese mixture didn’t get runny 🙈🙈🙈🙈
Ninja danishes
Omg, Cheesecake!!!!!!!!!

This looks....difficult
How is it you don't get fat with all those delicious food? I get fat so easily
Very nice
hello laura. can i use strawberries instead of raspberries? please reply I need an answer cause I want to make it now!
Yes ma'am   Please and Thank You.
Laura, Everything you cook and bake looks yummy!
funny but true story... the WORST danish that I've ever had was in Odense, Denmark. I spent almost 3 months living there.   (but that was in the late 1980s, so I sure hope their danish has improved over the years)
Can’t wait to try this Laura. Can you please share more recipes without meat as a component ?! Thank you !!!
This was delicious. Would love to see more vegetarian recipes on your channel
Looks aaaamazing!! Thank you for this awesome plant-based recipe!
I live large and take charge with my citrus too Laura 😂
I love this vegetarian recipe. Thanks Laura!
I LOVE that you shared a delicious,
100% plant based recipe.

More please. Pretty please. Thank you.
Laura is so funny. I love the little sayings. “No shame in my game.” “I live large and take charge...of my citrus.”
P.SA made me LOL!!  Thanks for the no meat recipe!
I will definitely make this tacos, thank you Laura, make more recipes with no meat like this🥰
I'm going to try this! I'm diabetic, It's hard to find healthy recipes that won't effect my blood sugar.
Thank you for making more veggie friendly videos! Can’t wait to try this one.
Three things I love: cauliflower, tacos, LAURA VITALE ❤️
The vegans are rejoicing lol
You are a joy to watch! Laura in the kitchen always feels like home❤️
Thank you so much for another vegetarian recipe!!!
I’m so excited !!  🌱 nation
Love it 😙👍
I'm going to make it later😊 thanks for sharing with us . Greetings from London..🤝
And you will need..... some AH-LIVE-OIL  XD
Rip people listening with earphones
I don't think this type of taco would fare will here in Los Angeles, California.
Thank you Laura for another video!! P.s. I love your videos they are so comforting to watch ❤
I made this the other night for my mom and sister and they LOVED IT! I added some thinly sliced bell peppers in the pan with the cauliflower and it was definitely a great addition. Thanks for the video <3
All of Laura's recipes I've made came out perfect and delicious; I love her. I didn't really care too much for these.I added smoked paprika for more flavor, and don't skimp on the lime; you will need it.
Omg! That looks awesomely delicious. Thank you Laura! ❤️
I love, love, love her praise for using a fresh mix of seasoning if possible. Jarred or boxed? Meh, it's ok. Fresh spice mix? 😂
Great i can't wait to try it this weekend. I'm looking at this like I'm having an affair! EPIC Laura
That looks amazingly delicious! Thank you for teaching us to make an awesome meatless taco meal! I hope you make lots more, how exciting, I would love to see what you would come up with being the great Chef you are!!!!!!!!!!

To make this keto friendly: omit the beans and use a lettuce wrap!
Yummmm!
That looks really good, but I might substitute kidney beans or another bean—I really don’t like chickpeas.
Those look delicious!  Will have to try them. We love roasted sweet potato and black bean tacos!
It's great to see you guys work well.
P.S.A. 😂😂
LMBO   The grandkids opened their mouths at the end - thinking you would really give them a bite....
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I haven't tried it this way but I have tried it like rise and like mashed potatoes or mac and cheese and I love it must give this a try.
Cauliflower tacos??? That’s the most stupidest thing I’ve ever heard🤮Stop trying to re-invent tacos, they are great just the way they’ve been made since forever
Can you do a updated version of beef Wellington
Should have done some keto taco shells for this.
Looks good but hold the cilantro!! I hate that stinkweed!
Who else loves edge pieces better?
Laura you were in a silly mood that day 🤣

Looks awesome, Laura! Brownies are my weakness!!!

You are a very good cook and when i look to cook something i look at your channel. I know a lot of people that has had or is having WLS(Weight Loss Surgery). Would you do a series of healthy recipes just for this reason? Thanks in advance.
Loved the intro, so happy you are over the cauliflower!
Oral diarrhea thats what u have , kindly talk less n work more !
I usually just love Laura but her presentation has become less passionate and kind of sloppy....cursory in a way. I wonder if she's getting tired of the show?
Too much sugar and carbs!!!
We need a big pot of that right now in Chicago Laura, its so cold..and that looks so good!
Looking glamorous Laura ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just made it. It’s delicious! ♥️💋 Thank you my love. I’m making the eclairs for later after the soup, as well. Xxoo I am opening a food truck soon, and you are inspiring. I love cooking and your ways are much more simple and less complicated then I make it. Proud of you and happy to know of you and enjoy your beautiful smile and videos. Love from Illinois!
I watched this video and I HAD to make it lol  So I put my 3 month old baby in his carrier, walked to the store and got the ingredients to make it.  And let me tell you this recipe did not disappoint!!  Not only did I love it but my husband and 2.5 year old daughter loved it too!!  Thanks again for a wonderful recipe Laura! <3
Actually  I like it when my leftover soups thicken 😁

DAWN dishwashing liquid...before washing. 
Pour over the stain and BAM its gone!! 
My new BFF!!
My OCD can't look away from that piece of onion. And how did it become suspended at the top edge without ending up in the soup?  I need to go shower.
Thanks Laura from one jersey girl to another 😉❤️👍🏻
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!❤️❤️
Hi Laura! I like your videos.
Would this make a good crockpot recipe?
Thats a very helpful tip about the rice. I noticed that about leftover soup.
Same like Lynn Recipes but with wild rice instead white rice
Another great production video. Learned a lot from you mostly because you give confidence to try new recipes. Great light, sound, and camera work. Thanks again.
Thank you for yet another amazing recipe!! Love you!! ❤

Creamy soup, yesssss! 😍
Good afternoon Laura Congratulations for her video and for her excellent quality work.
I know what I'm making this weekend 😋😋 Thank you! ❤️
Perfect for our stormy weather here in California can’t wait to make this thank you Laura!!😋
Perfect day for this. Im making this tonight!
Do you have any instant pot recipes?
Omg I’ve been waiting for this for so long!
hello Laura. can I use domestic rice for this dish?????
Laura I want to make video with you possible
Hi Laura I follow u on Facebook I didn't know u had a YouTube I love watching you
Great recipe, ur makeup is on point too !
delicious ♥ as usual. and the food looks great too. nothing like a chicken soup on a cold day to soothe a soul.
Laura in the Kitchen could you do blueberry cobbler on your Laura in the kitchen episodes
HIIII! I love you and your videos. I was wondering if you could do a creamy dairy free video. Me and my family are lactose intolerant. Have an amazing day.
Milwaukee needs this now too boo! ♥️😘
This looks so yummy and i've never seen mushrooms in a chicken rice soup before! I need to try this recipe!
What dairy free alternative can be used instead of the cow milk?
Mouthwatering!! 🤤🤤🤤😋😍
the world is your pickle phone case lmao love it
What flavor  mix did you use?
I need your cook book. Ive been hunting it down like a mad woman lol Haven’t had a chance to go to my barnes & noble to see if they got it😩 i love all your recipes 😊
Looks so delicious thank you.
I love Wild Rice. It is actually cold even here in SW Florida lol. I can Imagine Jersey must be 🥶.
19 degrees here in north jersey today 🥶🥶 this soup will for sure warm us up!! Looks good!! 🙂
Can I put almond flour instead of regular flour?
That's what I do with pasta or rice; instead of putting them in the soup I cook them separately and add them as I need them. I hate mushy pasta and rice! 😝
First?
I watch you for four years love you alot♥️
Oh my goodness, I need this now!! I'm over this cold here in Michigan but this soup will help me deal a little longer lol
What would be great is to grate some fresh Parmigiano on top .. thank you
Lovely, Laura, very nice soup!
ahhhh u finally have merch!!!!
I love this! I am definitely putting it on the menu for next week! 😀
She does it again! Beautiful recipe!
Interesting idea to use wild Rice for soup!
Looks good but I would wash the rice you would be amazed to see the dirt that comes out and the taste is amazing
Looks yummy!
Soup sounds so comforting right now
Already started making this :)
Wow this is exactly what I'm looking for in a soup....thank tons I'm making it tomorrow

#cheflkadhikari
Thanks for this recipe. I made it for supper and it is very,very delicious.

I pray I find a woman who can cook like laura someday
Yum! Laura if I substitute the milk for almond milk would it still work? ❤️
Love your recipes.
Ahhh,  Mrs. Vitale, I can always count on you, for a hearty soup recipe.  😎
Hi...Laura can you make recipe with coconut milk??
Awesome recipe - also fun watching that little onion piece trying to escape up the side of the pot!
Looks amazing, like all your recipes.  Can’t wait to make it.  Unable to find the recipe on your web page though.
My mouth is watering 😍😍
Making this soup right now.  Your makeup is flawless!!
Is there anything you would do differently to make this in a crockpot?
Puoi fare un video in italiano ❤️❤️❤️
yummy! I make a version of this on xmas eve. love it.
You look extra beautiful today.
Looks like a great soup.  Does it freeze well?  When I make my vegetable soup, I make a big batch and freeze some for a later date.
looks delectable Laura
Rachel Ray calls it stoup. Part stew and part soup! Either way it looks good!
Nice choice of colors,and don't apologize for using butter if they can't handle it eh too bad for them. I have been craving soup like this I will have to make a pot of it and enjoy the warm goodness.
Makeup on POINT!

This sounds yummy. I don't like mushrooms what could i use in it's place? Thank you
Cousin Laura! Your make up is POPPING LIKE THE SOUP ❤️
First!
Love this recipe as always <3, but let me ask you something, everytime i tryed to cook something with milk, he kinda coagulate (i don't know if this is the right word since i'm from Brazil and my english is kinda horrible, sorry about that). Do you have any tips to avoid this?
hi Laura
Can I leave the mushroom out
Could you make this dairy-free?
Is it me or does she look like Britney Spears?
Does anyone know where Laura buys her tops from?
I’m making this tonight!!!! 😊

How you cook is amazing, However you present yourself as single, you should always wear your wedding band. Even if you yourself and a handful of us know your married.
OMG MIA!!! 😍 its feels like yesterday when Laura shared that she was having a baby and now loook at Mia all grown up!! Time flewwww
Laura in the kitchen who ? This is Mia in the kitchen. Such a cutie
You guys have one of the best produced videos around. National broadcast shows can take lessons on how great your lighting and sound levels are and I could hear you perfect even during the blending. More important, you have easy to follow recipes and give confidence to everyone watching to follow on. Most important is a wonderful chef, pretty and charming. Keep up the great work!
So... about that new print button..
Your conversation with Mia is heartwarming

Um, who would thumbs this video down?..chocolate and cuteness all in one video..what more could you want?♡
LOVE it when Mia is in a vid! Love the bit where she picked up the chocolate and started nibbling, then you had to get a fresh one! Love her saying “yummy” and then creating her masterpiece with whipped cream on chocolate! ♥️
Both are cute pie😍🥰
I don’t know what’s sweeter! Mia or this pie! ❤️
Adorable!! I enjoyed watching!!
This looks literally MAGICAL!!!
ياريت شي العربية يشرح لنا باش نستافدو
That looks so yum!!! And you're such a sweet mum. And Miya such a cute like one. 😍
I agree! Everyone I know calls me a sloppy good cook cuz I never try to make it look pretty for presentation. Just looks like homemade food and always tastes bomb so who’s to complain? Lol
You are the absolute best! You licking the spoon and Mia going for the chocolate is me in the kitchen 😂. In the wise words of Mia, "yummy!".
Can you substitute sugar with Splenda?
You are the best

LOLLL I always have to replay the any part with Mia just to actually see and hear what you say cuz she’s always the star of the show when she’s on screen. Hahaha

There are no words, just hearts ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😊😁
Awww Mia is just so cute! ❤️
Mia is a cutie!  Who among us hasn't started eating the chocolate before baking lol. Also I made your enchillada recipe last night with my man and we loved them, very simple to do:)
Mia is such a cutie pie. Her name always makes me think of The Princess Diaries. Plus they're both beautiful princesses!
Mia!! Mama's lil clone <3
I made this and it is sooooo delicious! Now, I am making it again as we speak! YOU ALL SHOULD TRY THIS!!
God bless her ❤️
Too stinking cute....love Mia and mommy
This is my daughter's favorite pie. She's 18. I hope your girlie girl finds this her favorite also. I can't wait to try this this week.
Nice video. Watching late from 🇻🇳😘
you're soooo funny getting the pie out. lol lol lol
Where is my handheld electric whisk?? Where? O yeah, 1200km away from me:( Whyyyyy
Laura you never fail to amaze me when it comes to baking and cooking. I would have licked that bowl clean! 🤣🤣🤣. Where did your sous chef go? She's the cutest sous chef I've ever seen. What's a good brand of chocolate? I live in the south and the only ones I can find in my stores are Bakers and Ghirardelli.
I wish I could bake like you ❤
Hi Laura!
My main problem with pies is that I would like to have a thicker crust or base, what would you recommend that I substitute for traditional pie crust? I’ve thought about a shortbread crust or just more cookie crumbs?
Welcome to the Mia Show!!!
The Silk pie is good but Mia is the attraction here.
You are so funny and cute.  You remind me of my sister and me when we are together cooking.
Mia is adorable !!! 😍😍😍 I have a son almost Mia's age and he loves to watch Laura and Mia with me.
Thank you for sharing a "cooked egg" filling....Usually, French Silk Pie uses raw eggs, and I have made that version, way back in the day...Now, not so much.....I love you, and your channel....Mangia!
I LOVE this recipe!!
Mia is so cute. Thanks for having her in part of the video.
That looks soooo good! Mia is adorable 😍
Oh my goodness! She so big already!
Mia sei dolcissima!!! 😍🤗😘
Ooo my gosh I cnt wait to try it🤤
omg i remember Mia were in your tummy like not long ago! god blesss
I knew you were gonna lick the spatula! And we all know you’ll clean the bowl out with the spatula or a spoon😄😂
Can't decide what cracked me up more, you locking the chocolate or Mia.
too stinkin' cute! Mia! Lovely Mama and pie too!
My God, you're so damn hot 😍 And you are really good to watch as well, I like watching cooking videos, and I just found you, and if  this is episode 1332, I can't wait to watch you in the other 1331 haha, oh and to see all your yummy food too 😋
This looks so tasty, greetings<3

Mia is SO CUTE!!!  Laura, you are going to have so much fun over the years cooking with Mia!!!  Cooking with someone, a daughter, a sister, a friend, is the best!!!  It's such a great time for making special memories!!!  As for the pie, all I can say is YUM, YUM it looks so delicious!!!  I will gladly beat it, if it comes out looking as decadent as this does!!!  Thanks for the great recipe & for sharing your sweet little Mia with all of us .  She is too cute for words!!!
ahhhh Mia is the cutest thing ever !! ❤️
That is amazing
Mia is one of the cutest babies I've ever seen❤️😍😍
So I’m glad Ms. Mia isn’t in the whole video or I’d have to keep rewatching it over and over to actually see what your doing ! 😘🥰 love you and your little Mia she’s just too cute !! ❤️
Mia so beautiful
If you make 3 slices in your pie the first piece comes out easier-
Your daughter Mia is so much like her Mom , just ADORABLE! I’ve been watching your vids for a while, I went to tell my in-laws about u. They are Italian BTW, anyhoo they already knew about u, and watch your vids. Here I was trying to spread the word about u, but they already know bout u and luv u. 😋
Laura’s only 32?!?!  Yes!!!!
Hey! Laura has a mini-me!!!
Can we use whipping cream for this recipe?
WE LURVE MIAA
Absolutely adorable <3 <3 <3
Lol I love that you are reading comments now!!!
IIIII LOOVVVVVED THIIIIIS VIDEOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!😆😆😆😆😆 So full of love....♥️
I made this last night for Mardi Gras today! It tastes like melted chocolate ice cream 😍 so good!!
Mia is adorable!  And the pie YUMMY!
I'm making this next week for sure. I know just the chocolate to use. Aldi sells a dark chocolate that is out of this world. Very inexpensive, too, less than a Hershey bar of that same size but a billion times better. 

I also make s'mores with it. I've found dark chocolate works better for those.
Mia is sooo cute,plzz do more episodes with her😊
your recipes are soo good and Mia is soo lovely
Her expression at 0:05 lol creepy

Buenas tardes me gusta la reposteria y pastillaje hablar en español abrazos bendiga

Is there a recipe, or directions how to make the pie crust?
How old is Mia ?
The pie looks great!!!
Recipe suggestion - limoncello mascarpone cake pls!!!
How old is Mia?
Oh my God she looks JUST like you!
Cool
Is this your actual kitchen or is this just your filming space??
OMG!! Mia is so adorable!! Laura your French Silk Pie is looking yummy!! Thank you for sharing both your adorable daughter and fabulous recipe. Have a blessed weekend!!
MIA 😍😩
6:45 How many of you think she scraped that bowl clean with her spatula to have another taste once the camera stopped shooting?

And to be fair, how many of you would've done so yourself? (raises hand)
I love this recipe,  thank you,  cant wait to make it
Mia jest piękna ❤
I have made the recipe today, it’s yummy yummy yummy!!!!
Oh man. Eat that age up because before you know it they are all growed up!  Mine are 21,19,18,16. I can’t wait for grandchildren!
Mia is beyond adorable 😍 Was waiting for this all day after seeing Joe's Instagram story!
What maid the chocolate is
Wonderful and yummy. She's so cute
Miaaaa is super cute,Mommy’s 👧 ,she eats the chocolate just like her Mom does.
so cute
Mmmm pie!!!!!! My all time favorite pie!!!!!
Your the queen 👸 in the kitchen
Stop right now !! Mia is such a little ham!! Laura this pie looks slammmmming💋💋💋💋💋 love u girl !
Little Mia's so precious.. Excuse me Laura, did you say something? Lol! Just kidding! Your daughter is a beautiful doll! ... and the pie looks so delish! ;)
I have been watching your channel since I believe 2011. So just so you know I TOTALLY predicted the chocolaty spatula was going in your mouth! I busted out laughing when you did it! You are so adorably hysterical! I love that I can come to your channel and finish watching your video's with a smile on my face because you bring so much joy to so many of us! I cannot wait to try this recipe. And by the way I am making your pork chops and potato's you posted the other day. I just can't make the broccoli rabe because they apparently don't sell it here in Utah! Darn it! Love you and your channel!
Laura- please be mindful that some of your recipes on your website have the wrong measurements. I have made a few & did not have good results as the measurements were incorrect.
Cute
Yummy! And, daddy! You guys have a great life. I even heard, "cupcake," at the end! Cupcakes!
Hi mia
The pie looks almost as good as Mia, lol  I grew up making French Silk pie the traditional uncooked method, still make it that way to this day. I will have to try your method with cream, it looks yummy. Something I do is use a homemade toasted coconut crust instead of a pastry crust. I can't remember if you like coconut or not, but if you do, it's fantastic this way. Chocolate + coconut. YUM!!
Is there any way possible you can do an egg custard pie??
She looks like you more than you look like you.Nonetheless what a cutie.
You're only 32!?!? Huh.
Great Video!!! :) :) :)
hahaha I think it's about time you change ur channel name to "Laura & Mia in the Kitchen". 😘 Absolutely love seeing your little one cooking with you!! <3
Laura... ideas for future shows???
Take us grocery shopping with you.
Give us a tour of your pantry and freezer 😜
Both kitchen tours .. 
we would love it I am sure.... 
thumbs up if you guys want to see it 👍👍
6:55 " To the Broccoli Rabe " ? Do you mean " To the pork chops instead " ?😂
So who has tried out the new print button on my website?? And who has used the fancy QR code on the printout? Your cooking game is about to be elevated to a whole new level!! Go try it and see what I mean! 😉
This is the kind of go-to family dinner I love to see you cook, Laura (and Joe)....I can feel La Famiglia!
Can someone count how many times she said broccoli rabe?
I don't even eat pork yet I can't stop myself from watching every single episode you upload ❤️❤️
The classic princess of cooking, I have been following you since I was in the very first year of college and it has been 7 years since I followed you
Another idea to use up the 21 pounds of pork loin I bought for $.99 a pound...
Hi Laura, this light pink top  is so beautiful on you! I don't eat that much of a pork, but love  this episode. I can substitute with chicken?  All of your recipes are amazing! Love that Dutch wight oven...  Hope you have a wonderful day dear. <3
Thanks a lot for this pork recipe  ! ! !  !     Amazing video my friend  ! ! ! ! Hello from FRANCE  ! ! ! !  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Fantastic Recipe! Looks very delicious! All the best!

Could you share your recipe for limoncello mascarpone cake??
♥this is awesome, thank you for this delicious recipe! (..I'm Not living my best life, my pot holder has an owl on it! Lol:-D♥ thanks Laura, you make cooking fun)
Nice and seasonable person that give a great upbeat tone. Great sound and video quality. I feel like I can do that what I watch the videos. Keep up the great wrk.
I love this style of the video. A whole meal step by step! Looks phenomenal 🤤 definitely going to try this out!
In preparation step 5 & in video you "season the broccoli rabe on both sides with the garlic salt and a very light grating of parm . . ." Isn't this the pork chop preparation, not broccoli rabe?
I really love all your recipes. Thank you for sharing your cuisine with us!
I think the pork chop needed more cooking you cook that meat really fast:) maybe I’ll cook them like you did and finish them in the oven “but thank you for sharing:) love your cooking :p
I LUV that Lil Duval record too!!! & your recipe obcourse!!! Cant wait 4 your next upload!!! Thanks😀
Thank you  Laura! I work in Produce in my store and had no idea how to use broccoli  rabe! Now I do! What you made looks fabulous and  I'm going to make this!! Thanks so much!

My son loves pork chops I’m gonna try this recipe thx Laura 😘😘
I love pork and chicken and this looks so so good. Thanks Laura! You are the best. Maybe you can cook with Rosanna Pansino one day. That would be awsome. Hugs from Norway.
Love the family dinner feel of this!
I love pork, Ty for the recipe.
Laura I enjoy your videos so much for the food that you cook is just amazing and so simple I just wanted to say I have to try this so this weekend yeah I'll have to let you know and how good it is Curse it is good I can already tell but I just wanted to share that have a wonderfully great day and thanks again for sharing ♡
Looks amazing Laura! As an Italian I too grew up with broccoli rabe on my dinner table at least once or twice a week and I serve it once or twice a week as well thank you for sharing.
I think I know what Sunday dinner is now!!
Omg.Today I saw you in my dream......May God bless you
I never knew what broccoli rabe was until I watched your channel. I was raised by some fake Italians :)
Hey does anyone know what's the recipe with potato beef and tomatoes in the skillet in the intro? Love the recipes btw.
Cousin Laura!!! The way you dip that potato in the sauce!! Iconic!!! Live your best life!
I've been looking for a new way to do pork chops, I'll have to try this! You think it would still work if I substituted white wine for the beer? I typically dont have beer in my home but always have wine for cooking
I love broccoli rabe, we had yesterday with rosted pine nuts and dried cranberries. Such a good combo too
Looks super yummy as usual Laura!
This video is sponsored by Broccoli Rabe 😄
I love how that potato just jumped in your mouth.  It looked like you tried to put it back. But resistance was futile.  🤤😂
I don't like pork chops 🙄
Drink every time Laura says broccoli rabe.
I'm so doing this. I just got broccoli rabe after years of avoiding it after a bad experience (it was not cooked correctly and it was so bitter that it was inedible). Now that I know the proper way to cook it, I'm ready to try it again. Thanks so much, Laura! ❤❤❤
I'm  always looking for more ways to use kale, Laura. Hint, hint...
Queen Laura, after all these years, delicious food
Wonderful. You make me love food.
In Australia we don’t have broccoli rabe (that I know of anyways) but I’m definitely trying this with a broccolini and spinach combo !!! Yum 😋
Wowwwww😍😍😍😍😍😍
Next time add some Apple juice in That pan after removing The meat - TRY !🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼😍 Thats What I do 😉😉😉😉😉
Omg! My Italian dream!
Superb video! Amazing !
laura your love shines through your food. you rock
Well done... thank you
When she dipped that potato in the gravy sauce...............everythang!!!!
I just tried your new ‘print’ button. It is fabulous!!!  I am going to reprint a lot of your recipes again. Thank you, thank you. Love your videos. Have made several different recipes.  Absolutely love the chicken cutlet one - quick, easy and comes out so moist and tasty every time.  Could you please tell me how you keep your parmesan cheese. I use  it all the time (the real stuff) but it can dry out (I still use). Thanks
Seems like a good date night meal.
I started a cooking channel too I would love some feedback!!!
Luckiest husband ever
Laura, I am having a porkgasm!! Yummy!
Fantastic meal!!!  I am going to make this!!
That is exactly how I was taught to make my broccoli di Rabe by my mom..This is one of my all time favorite veggie, I love it too!..I can smell it cooking too! delish!
You're a great chef.
What is the best way to clean a enamel coated cast iron pan or pot?
How many times did she say "broccoli rob"
What I love is Pork chops with vinegar peppers 🌶😊😋😛😊😊
Doesnt she run out of recipes
your tip for the potatoes is genius
Le cime di rapaaaaaa 😍
For those who don't like the bitterness, try adding a little onion to the garlic in the beginning.
SHY 👍
OH YEAAAA 😃
Delicious!
I have Disney towels in my kitchen, does that count as living your best life?😉
I have never been able to make a tender pork chop until I started brining them before cooking. Makes all the difference
You feed the world!
This issue has been resolved. The freezing of the picture, I think, is due to my archaic computer; although, I would like to know why it doesn't happen when I am watching other videos. Anyway. It is working much better.
My problem when I cook pork chops on the stove is smoke! Cooking 1 side is fine but once I flip, it starts to smoke and my alarm goes off. I sometimes cover the pan and then take lid off outside lol!
Love the video and the recipe. If you want to play the drinking game. Every time Laura say's Broccoli Rabe you drink. LOL. Love you Laura. You Rock.
This is great thank you 😊This is definitely on my next weeks menu. Although tempting to make this week would be this week we just had pork chops last night. I could eat them again but my honey likes something different each evening. Yes I know he is definitely spoiled LOL I believe in the spirit of Christmas all year so yes I do have my Christmas pot holders in my kitchen.
Nice
Can't find this recipe on your website.
Mia Valentina Please !!!!
Every time I watch your videos I have to struggle to get through them because the video freezes up. Laura in the kitchen is the only VLOG that I have any trouble with. Could this be on your end. It freezes then connects freezes then connects through all of the videos I recieve from Laura in the kitchen. Does anybody have any suggestions. Any tricks up their sleeves.
Yummy
Does the pork take only 3minutes each side to b coked through?
Parsley should of went on the potatoes
Mmmmmmm...
Hi Laura. This looks good. I don't eat pork and drink. Can I use beef or chicken stock and chicken or lamb chops instead of pork and beer? Thank you heaps. Can you show us how to do more Korean food? Thank you. By the way, I love your previous video. It's actually inspired by bulgogi.
I can attest to Laura's two-step cooking method for potatoes.  That is exactly how I have been doing it for quite some time.  The initial parboiling (I use a mildly seasoned, aromatic vegetable broth) keeps the potatoes moist and flavorful inside.  The final browning in the oven gives the potatoes depth of flavor and crispiness.  I personally prefer Yukon Gold potatoes ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukon_Gold_potato ).
I love these family meals! My husband and I don’t eat pork, just because our families didn’t grow up with it overseas, but you made this look beauuuuutiful! I’d be doing the same thing with those potatoes dipping them in the sauce, with or without people around!! Hahah
Broccoli Rabe must be bitter af if a less bitter substitute is kale 😂 Im a bit of a baby with bitter vegetables, I cant do it. Looks like I will be sticking with a boatload of spinach which is my go-to leafy green.
i dont get people who blanch their broccoli rabe
Do a matzo ball soup recipe video
Ever make a potato coated onion ring. I figure mix milk in some mash potatoes until it gets a batter consistency then coat onion ring in flour then dredge in potato batter then bread crumbs. Do you dare to dream. Remember going to the burger place and finding that lone onion ring in your frys, now combining 2 worlds into 1
I’ve never seen cherry peppers in my grocery stores.. is there another name that they can be known by?
USE TONGS!  DON'T STAB YOUR MEAT WITH A FORK!
Probably a dumb question, but where do you buy broccoli rabe?  After Food Network raved about it across several shows, I asked at three local grocery stores. None of the produce people knew what I was talking about. They wondered if I really meant broccoli and was making the rabe part up. Help! I want to cook like the cool kids.
Mmm looks great! Can't wait to make this for the boys on the Russian Front.
I don’t eat pork but this just made me eat it
Pork is the most unhealthy food on the planet
As a Korean, I love this video! Usaully we do marinated the meat first, but who cares?? if it taste good, It's a good recipes! If you want to eat Bulgogi at home, use thin slice of beef and marinated with Laura's sauce. then stir-fry with spring onions and onions. Anyway, Thank you Laura for sharing lovely recipe!    (sorry for my poor english)
Finally Korean recipe !!!  Grazie laura ! From
Italia ! 🇰🇷🇮🇹
Korean beef & rice is one of my go-to dinners because it’s so FAST! I like to serve it with steamed Basmati rice, and steamed broccoli.
This would probably make a bomb meat for lettuce wraps.
Ok not food related, but you look so beautiful and glowing in this video! And I love your makeup! Did you use the desi x Katy eyeshadow palette? 😏 I def have the same one lol. 
Back to the food- this looks so bomb!! I’ve always loved Korean food and this is such a super simple shortcut to Korean beef!
Literally one of your shortest videos and well worth it! That sauce looks 🤤🤤 Hi Laura!
Super-easy and yummy recipe! Quick to cook and tasty... what else?! 😊👌
Thanks Laura! I have some Beyond Meat brand crumbles, and I'll use this with the ingredients mentioned and try it this way! Thanks so much for the idea!!!👍🏻
This is a simplified, family friendly version of Bulgogi....Korean BBQ Beef....Thank you for sharing your version
yum!   I love med rare beef, .... but your suggestion of cooking ground beef crispy for this recipe is Terrific!!!   Love the seasonings, this is on my bucket list recipes to try SOON!!  thanks
Attempting to make this tonight. Thanks Laura
😋Yum! Korean beef and rice is my favorite quick meal to make at home. Love your ingredients, I use those as well with half of a lime juice. Delicious!
This looks like it would be even better with some gochujang 🤤
I tried this recipe today and I loved it. Thank you for posting it. I love your channel. All the best.
Wow amazing recipe your beef  looks excellent
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe👍💖💜💚💟💙💗👌💞🌞💛🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
A Korean recipe by Laura in the Kitchen!!! It's AWESOME!!! I love that you are not afraid exploring/experimenting with food from different cultures and sharing your own versions with us. Thank you Laura!!♡♡
Laura could you please do a bourbon chicken recipe video, there's only a handful of good or adequate videos of the recipe but I want to see how you make it!
We love Korean kitchen, thanks for sharing.

What is the brand name of your non-stick pots and pans?
I'm kinda craving something that has a garlic taste to it....
Do you have a recipe?
If so please make a video so i can try, and most likely fail, to make it😂
Please and Thank you!
Made this it was amazing and super easy
Thank You!! I qm glad I tried this recipe. It's so good.
I made this tonight with ground pork that we raised and processed on our farm. It was amazing!!  Much love ❤️
Honestly It don't look like Korean food as visual, but sauce is based on Bulgogi for sure. Super simple version I think and I REALLY love your recipe! :)
Looks delicious, yet simple to make. Just the way i like it. Thanks, Laura, for all the great recipes!
Laura, you have the BEST recipes! Love your channel!!
Excellent Laura!! I love your recipe sooooo much!
Laura, absolutely amazing recipe, as always Laura.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful, juicy, delicious recipe. You’re good.  Job well done!
Thank you so much! I didn’t know that frying the meat for such a long time can be this good
You are Amazing Laura! I LOVE YOU! been watching your videos since waaaay back. you're the best <3
You are a gift from foodie heaven, a real food genius. Your recipes are always a hit in my house.
You look beautiful Laura and I'd like to try this recipe :)
I waiting for this!!!!you finally cook korean food!!!! So cool
Fantastic can you send me the recipe , Ive watched  the vedio and keep getting lost , Thank you and keep them coming
Just made this tonight and it was great!!! Just be careful with soy sauce, it was almost too much sodium for my taste.... but the rice made it work ❤️
Laura you are my favourite cook ❤ love from Singapore :)
I made this for dinner and it was so delicious and flavorful!! Plus, I love how quick and easy it was to make! Thank you, Laura!! 😊❤️
I was literally just looking for a recipe on this last week!! Crazy! I have a bunch of ground venison I gotta do something with
This recipe is soooo good! 
It’s a quick meal and has so much flavour! I’ve made it with ground beef, sliced beef, and ground chicken- all amazing!
an italian legend cooking a korean dish 😍😍
That sounds delicious. Thanks for sharing Laura. Blessings !
Could you make this with ground turkey or chicken?
The sauce is boss 😂❤ love you and korean beef! i get bi bimbop all the time this reminded me of the beef in it and it is served in a hot bowl with rice,veggie, and egg! Yum!!!! Can't wait to try it at home.
Great recipe, although,  personally, I'll swap the sugar for pure honey!
Although this dish is absolutely not korean (i think this dish is more like taiwanese minced pork stew with rice), i think you did a great job & i luv this recipe!! Very simple & easy!!
Thanks, Laura! I love your show!
I found it was way too salty,  0.5 cup of soy sauce with 1.5 pounds of ground beef, is that right?
I'm going to try this! AND...your eye makeup looks awesome!
It looks great! Thanks for the recipe. By the way, can you please make a cherry pie? Thanks a lot
Hello Laura you are very good at explaining the recipe and cooking.
Can you make this with ground turkey or chicken?
Yeaaa Laura! Thanks for the recipe
Thanks for the recipe fix :)
Love how quick this is, served with kimchi yum!
I make this easy recipe sometimes when I want a quick and economical meal, except just like if it was for spaguetti with tomato sauce.  I will now try your korean version.  Thank you.
i love that sauce!! i use it for my tofu
Long time subscriber says, another great recipe yet again. I can"t wait to try it.
What brand /s of cookware do you use? Love your videos. Thank you,😁👌
This with kimchi or some sort of pickle would be a match made in heaven
Please make Nasi Goreng. It's Indonesian signature dish 👍
Hi Laura, I’ve been watching your videos since 2014 and your recipes never fail. I recently just made your banana bread and your stuffed shells and they were so good.
We need the perfect deep dish pizza recipe 😩😩
Yeeees, so great!!!
Laura I’ve made two of your recipes this week. Taco soup and the coated chicken.
Wow! This was crazy fast. Looked really good too!
Laura, looks like a great recipe.

Oh yeah... definitely going to make this! 😉
Your fine 🔥🔥🔥

Would you happen to have a Mongolian Beef recipe? If not...can you?? Lol. 😉
As a Korean I love it when I see a creative twist on Korean food! That thumbnail with chopsticks makes me a bit cringe BUT, YES TO THE SESAME OIL👍 

A spoonful of sesame oil makes everything taste Korean.
We neeeed kimchi recipe please!!!
Yum  cantvwait to make this
OMG I make this all the time. great comfort food. lol
I could eat this all day! Great job ont he video!
You hit the right Korean flavors with this dish!
Did you lower the heat before or after adding the sauce?
could you please make pasta alla norma?? its an italian classic and i would love to see u make it
We eat this at least once a week!! Will you please share the brand of skillet you’re using? I need one with those straight-up sides.
OMG! When I cook ground beef for other recipes, I always burn my meat like this an throw it away. How awesome, now it won't go to waste cuz I'ma make this recipe.. thanks..😎😍
You always have something interesting to show and makes me hungry
Looks yummmmmmy!!
I need one of those pans!
this looks good! i never would have thought to use ground beef like this. looks like it could be good with lettuce and kimchi
Laura, ti amo ! 😘
This looks amazing I'm seriously craving it right now
This looks amazing, and super easy to make.
Cheers from Koreaaaaa♥
so basically its korean styled dirty rice? weird
Laura you are my spirit animal

I always top mine’s off with a fried egg and a side of danmuji (yellow pickled radish) 😍 great comfort food!!
This is a go to recipe we use a few times a month
Hi Laura, excited about this new video 💕💕
Wow, beautiful and a great cook!  Marry me.
Drooling! Looks delicious, and easy peasy!
I love Lorena ground beef.  Great flavors and so easy to make. 😊
Looks so good but it needs a green vegetable haha
...
I'm so excited for tonight's, definitely making this. And I already have everything on hand =)!!
Your eye makeup is gorgeous in this video!! Can you share the color and brand you are using?!?
How much seasame oil is used? I didn’t see it in the written recipe. Sounds delish!
Korean inspired is better to say.. ;;
You guys whats the dish called at 0:03 during the intro looks so good i want to see and try the recipe
Best way to break up ground meat (unless you use a non-stick pan) is with an old-fashioned wavy wire potato masher.
More Korean recipes pls!!!!:)
Laura, had to stop the video half way to tell you something that has nothing to do with cooking. You look fabulous!! Love your makeup here and your lipstick is gorgeous! What lipstick you wearing? Beeeeeaaaaaauuuutiful!!
Oh wow, I have almost everything I need to make this in cupboard! We don’t eat ground beef, what type of beef do you recommend instead? Thanks love!
What eyeshadow are you wearing?? 💗
That's so simple! I'm gonna make that for meal prep
Omg gotta try so simple too🤤
Defo going to make this 😁👍🏼👍🏼✌🏼
For f*** sake, stop telling Laura her dish isn’t Korean or that it is not the way your Korean grandma would make it. Just enjoy an easy, quick and delicious dish!! 🤦🏻‍♀️
Ahhhhh finally a Korean recipeee 😍😍😍😍😍
Dang Laura! I did not know you could rap! You got speed! Hahaha! 3:54
I would like to see you use an ostrich egg to make some type of recipe. :)
Yes! Asian food!🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I NeVeR sAiD iT wAs AuThEnTiC!  It'S kOrEaN tO mE!  ~ A white lady who just tacks ethnicities onto meals because she feels like it.
The sauce is boss Laura.... Yesss love it!!
It's ground beef stewed Korean 😂
Looks SO yummy! What brand and size is the skillet! I'm on the hunt for a new one!
Please do some Filipino recipe
Doesn't look very good.
Rice and anything is good 👍
Hello Laura,  With some of your main dishes, could you suggest items that goes with your recipes?  Veggies and ????  Love your program!
Made this recipe for supper tonight! The sauce was really delicious!!! (although I replaced some of the soy sauce with water because it was a little too salty for my taste, and added some sambal oelek for that spicy kick)
I added onions, peppers and pois mange-tout (sorry i don’t know the English name!) to the beef and rolled it in with jasmin rice and scallions in lettuce wraps. And wow! Just like you said, the taste of the sesame oil with the ginger was incredibly good!
Easy, tasty and fast recipe for a 17 years old! Thank you Laura!
The fact that she has used the same type of intro for 9 days.
Very nice & delicious recipe 😊
I have to try this recipe for sure. Looks soooo good.
Could you substitute ground turkey for the beef?
simply divine
I just ate and this made me hungry.
Thanks for the great and easy recipe. Can’t wait to try it!
Luv the videos.... I’ve said this before it’s amazing she doesn’t weigh 500lbs
Looks so good n tasty!
Looks too good Laura..I have to make this
Cant wait to try this!! 😍😍
I've made this dish numerous times. Quick and delicious.
Do you ever wash the ground beef?
It looks like the ground beef version of Bulgogi
I’m making ur meat sauce and I added 3 cups of water instead of 3-1/2cups 🤦🏼‍♀️ is there anything I can do for the sauce to come out right?
Buy Bulgogi not ground beef
Love your videos! Great food and you are a blast to watch! Thanks!
makeup tutorial !
Korean food suits my taste very well
Amazing cooking

Very dried beef bbq looks nice~

What a simple dinner idea. Gotta try it
Just wanted to let you know I'm making your chicken and dumplings right now. A meal requested by hubby.
Mmmm I gotta make this
It looks amazing i have to give it a try. One question: is there anyway i can use sirloin instead? I know it gets so hard of it’s cooked a lot like the ground beef you’re using, but is there anyway for it?
Save the fat to season cast iron cookware!
The beef is clumpy.
I can't wait to make this!
Mi is getting so big and she is so Beautiful👧👩❤️
Looks dry!
3:33 Ouch...!!!
You should make pad thai!
So easy!! Can't wait to try it
omg that was quick 🤣🤩
HEEEY
Love your cooking Laura ❤️
Mute.
Is this post too old to have a reply??
Make this with beef but not ground beef
cook
Delicious!!!!!!!
Looks absolutely DELICIOUS! And I bet the food is too!
So I'm always looking for a beef recipe so I can sneak more lentils in...(Brown lentils and beef go so well together!). Plus my body really agrees with me when I eat lentils but I don't like the taste of it especially the indian lentil recipes....that's why I like to sneak it in many different kind of beef recipes--burritos, tacos, stuffed peppers, etc. This one seems like a perfect one to sneak lentils into because the asian flavors and beef will overpower the lentils. Can't wait to try maybe with some steamed broccoli <3
Can’t find the recipe on your website. Pls help!
Thanks
Yumm!   Made the dish and mixed in some chopped broccoli w/ the beef. Next time though, might mix regular and low sodium soy sauce (just a little bit too salty....but delicious!).
try ethiopian food
This video is awesome
This looks so good! We have a chuck roast in the freezer that we cut in half! We can grind it and make this tomorrow night for dinner! Omnomnom
I love how organized and managed she is....
This looks delicious
How much toasted sesame oil do you have in with the soy sauce? I didn't see it on your written recipe. Thanks!
you didnt even use korean pepper flakes. how is this korean at all? there's literally NOTHING korean about this...
Wonder how this would hold up to making it with ground turkey or chicken? 🤔
Danm it Laura.  You’ve done it again.  😍😍😛😛
Yummy and simple. ️ ❤️
How is this Korean?
Laura,you look so beautiful in this video!
I make this all the time.  Seriously my favorite I could eat all of it.  I use only 1 Tbsp sesame oil no other oils.
Yumm
Properly can't understand that what kind of spices , materials and quantity  are using. If you show spices and quantity by written format so that I can understand properly.  Thanks   .
Can you substitute the brown suger with regular white sugar
God your outro sounded robotic and scripted. Forced, Like u didn’t want to say it at all.
I’m totally making this! I’m gonna steam some broccoli with it!
Divorce and marry me XD
Could you substitute turkey for ground beef?
So easy, I’m making that 😋😋😋😋
Mia
Si behet kjo
Hi Laura, could I make this with turkey meat instead? :) it looks so delicious, I’m just not too much of a beef eater!
I want to make this tonight but I can't bring this up on the website's search engine.
Wow 😮!!! My mouths watering... Btw Laura I’m from Sri Lanka I don’t think we have ground beef ... what can I do ??? Anyone ??
Is there a substitute for the red pepper flakes for people with family members that can’t have spicy hot food?
It's so funny how much Laura don't play when it comes to her food! 'Yeah, yeah. I'll see you next time. Bye!'
Hi laura.plz in next video also take mia with you.I love watching her..
First oh yeah and there's one view but to the likes mom YouTube drunk again
Love from Korea to Laura and her family Xxx♡
You eat Rice with a spoon not a fork.
Woah finally a Korean dish! Been a subscriber for years. I’d love to see more Korean food recipes from you Laura 🥰
Thank you so much Laura. I love Korean food. Can you do your take on Kimchi fried rice?
Laura, ignore the people giving you hassle about what you have named this recipe. You already said you know it isn’t authentic. You don’t have to justify it to anyone!
Are you into martial arts?
Hey Laura, 
Wassup with all these werid recipes lately? Can u go back to yummy Italian recipes 😋
A dish inspired by an authentic recipe doesn’t have to be authentic. Your creation is what you make of it. People need to get over themselves! On another note I would cut some of the brown sugar by putting some zucchini and onion in with the beef. Finishing with the sesame oil at the end instead of on the heat would allow the aroma and original flavor of the oil to stick out more!  Nice and simple recipe. Love your cooking, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!
Very nice!
Did anyone else start the video and then restart because you thought you fast forwarded the video?
"I don't judge, I just eat"
Preach 🙏🙏🙏
Your personality shines in this video lol I love it! This definitely does look very comforting! I’m so curious to see your other versions too!
Chicken pot pie version of this please!!!
I like the little intro bloopers😂
Kind of like shepherd's pie only with tater tots. I like this idea better.
"I don't judge, I just eat."
Wisest words ever spoken. ❤
You had me at taco tater tot casserole, I didn't even know something like this existed. I'm going to try this tonight, I just need to go buy tater tots.
Now this is a comfort food I didn't know I needed!
7:06 I love you Laura, you bring a smile to my face every time I watch you. I couldnt stop laughing. Thanks so much, even a bad day is lightened up when youre cooking. :D <3 And well, yeah, now I am hungry, thanks for that. Looks so good.
No Laura, you would never steer us wrong. 😘
I NEED THE TACO VERSION 🙏🏼😍💛
Yummy!😋 9x9 is too small for our family tho🥺 cuz that dish would be gone in 5 minutes!😳😛


Update: I made this tonight👍
I had cream cheese on hand, it was SO creamy and GOOD! Omg! Best comfort food ever! Happy family!😃
Love the cute intro Laura!! Always great to see you have fun in the kitchen 😊
Excuse me.....it's hot dish.
Love from Minnesota ❤️
Tater Tot Casserole, I guess i got something to blame for my winter body 🤣🤣🤣
Greetings from Algiers , Deliciouuuus dish bravo Laura
Laura you’re too funny, I could watch you all day❤️
I think Blooper videos would be absolutely amazing lol
Te amo!! Tus preparaciones 💓Laura COLOMBIA 🇦🇲🌸
Cousin LAURA! Direction delicious!! This is great for the cold weather
"I don't judge, I just eat". I think you may have found your first slogan for a t-shirt! ha ha ha
I'm making this tonight! Thank you!
we say (Worcestershire Sauce)  as "Wuster Sauce" in the UK :)
Love how your pots and pans look used! Its so real and relatable...
Thank you for sharing this recipe. I am going to make with veg soya mince. Looking forward cooking something different.
This is very big in Minnesota except we call it hot dish there 🤪 The way most make it there is ground beef mixed with one can of corn, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, mix it all together then spread a can of cheddar cheese soup on the top, top that with shredded cheddar cheese and tots. Very easy! I’ll have to try it her way as well.
Nice recipe , looks like good comfort food, by lean beef, i recommend 90/10 beef to fat ratio, may say ground sirloin on package, no 73/27, 80/20, 85/15, to much fat for this recipe, tater tots will be soggy.
LMBOOOOO LOVING THE PRE-INTRO BLOOPERS!
I can not wait to make this! I’m always looking for recipes for casseroles! Your recipes are always a hit with me and my boyfriend! It was fun spending time with you. Thank you for sharing. 😊
I love the way Laura said, "My parsley!" I think that was a British accent to go with the Worcestershire sauce! Lol!!!!😂😂👍❤️❤️❤️
Love your channel! I've been watching and making your recipes for years! You are an inspiration! We make your Caesar salad all the time! Thank you so much for sharing your cooking talent with us! :)
laura love you, your production is great, and can even be greater if you use some new angles! and music too!
Love seeing your goofy side! Who doesn't love a good tator tot casserole. Great recipe as always, Laura!
You’re adorable!!! Thanks for sharing 😘😘😘😘
This looks delicious! Was looking for something to serve company for lunch. This will be great. Look forward to your chicken version, too! Awesome recipes. Thanks so much.
Quick question.  Are the tots still frozen when you layer them on top?
Just made this I  added taco seasoning ... absolutely fantastic , so good Laura 👍So glad I found your channel .
LAURA:   How much steak seasoning?  It's not even listed on the ingredients on the recipe.  Thank you.
Laura I love 💕 watching you and am trying some of your recipes!! So excited!
Looks good Laura! Can you share veggie version of this recipe as I am vegetarian! 💕
Where's your mini me 😔. I love seeing you and your daughter cook together but still a great video as always!!! 😊
That was the funniest, best video you have done!!  Your personality was great. I just wanted to see what you were gonna say or do next
Perfection!!Laura you are so sweet in this Video!Love it
You made a version of shepherds pie. I'm not complaining I can't wait to try it.
Can never go wrong with any variation of shepherds pie...yum!!
Well, these ingredients are going on the shopping list. Thanks Laura.
Looks AMAZING! - Thanks Laura!
😍 it's a different take on Shepherd's Pie and it looks delicious.
Is there any food you don’t like, Laura? 😜 I love your recipes and I tried a bunch of them at home already ❤️
🌸 Yum.  Isn't everything better with tater tots?  I've made many versions of this and every one has been amazing.  Tots rock!
Pass me some of that divineness, please. So easy to make. It would work well for my church potluck, which I think I will make for this Sunday. Thank you, Laura.
I made this tonight, was delicious and looked exactly like Laura Vitale,  Thank you Laura😊
Oooh I think green beans instead of corn for me. Thanks Laura!
Loved, loved the beginning!!  🥰  Made me chuckle.  This is one of my favorite comfort food dishes.  I make this all the time.  I will most definitely use your recipe the next time (who doesn't love Worcestershire sauce!!)!
Buffalo chicken version but without the bleu cheese
OMG I’m drooling 🤤. I will be making this ... this week !! Thanks Laura !! ❤️😃
It's amazing how Laura Vitali just comes up with different food recipes, I have never heard of tater tot casserole before.
Made this last night with ground moose and veggie tots! It was delish, great recipe 👌🏼
Like always great recipe. 👍👍👍
You can use sausage instead of beef to make a breakfast tater tot casserole
I cooked in cast iron on my smoker. Came out very good. Maybe try crumbled bacon on top next time!Or sausage crumbled up...Thanks,Dennis
What Are You Doing  🤔❣️ That's Bomb💥💣!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've always made it with green beans, I couldn't imagine it with corn 😅 and cream of chicken and mushroom.  So an alternative to this would be that and it's 👌🏻
Thank you for sharing your version on a classic recipe. My family loves tater tot hot dish!!  It’s the most comforting food, especially when it’s cold & snowing 8 inches today.
Laura your intro music reminds me of  MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING
Hey Laura h r u dear. I am soon gonna try this recipe its lukin sooooo yummmm.thank u soo much
Laura can you pleaseeee post your basic stuffed peppers recipe???
I just found my new youtube crush!! hahhaa.. Jk great video.. Would have never thought of doing anything like this
'I don't judge.. I just eat.' 
I GET YOU GIRL!
One word; Salivating!!! Mmmm!! Nice one, Laura!! As always!! xo <3
Oooh looks delicious! Can you please share the chicken pot pie version?
Kinda reminds me of a twist on Shepherds Pie!
Laura, no ma'am you would not stir me wrong! LOL I love tater tots and can't wait to make this for my family.  I love your recipes by the way...they always taste so great when I reinvent them :)
Thank you for the Tator tot casserole, have googled this a few times but yours I will use
LOOK'S GOOD LAURA!!!! I'LL HAVE SOME!!!! GOTTA MAKE THIS!!!
Tater tots...one of the best ways to eat taters
shepherd pie with a crispy crust, pretty much.
My mouth is watering! Thank you for this recipe!
Would love to see the Taco version of this casserole!
The intro!! 😂😂
Can you do a buffalo chicken Mac and cheese please!?
Very nice & yummy recipe 😍
NICE! :D Thank you!! I had come up with one that didn't use canned soup....this looks better.
You can tell she was definitely having an amazing day! Shes so bubbly in this video, I love her❤️
Lovvveeeeeee!!!!!!! I know this as hot dish because of my Midwest roots! Thanks for the great recipe!
Would this be a casserole you could make ahead and freeze?
You somehow remind me of Bree from desperate housewives. ❤☺
I have no idea, what Laura is smoking, but I wanna the same stuff! :D Love you, Laura! :* ;) <3
Just curious what is the flour for? I have never used that anytime I made mine so just curious lol.
Don't you worry girl. I still have my Christmas kitchen towels too. 😊
I love your sense of humour xo xD
Oh, this looks SO yummy & comforting for a cold winter night!!!  I know my family will love this!!  Like you said, who doesn't like tater tots!!!  Thanks Laura, I can't wait to try this!!!
love ur personality in this one laura.
So tasty 😋 like it!
Laura will you adopt me. 🙋🏻‍♀️I would love to eat your food every day 😂
The video starts with the end lol 😂 love it..
Looks yummy Laura! Love the Christmas pot holders ☺️. No judgement here...I leave a tiny little gingerbread house out all year 🥰😉.
It’s a shepherds pie with tater tots!
They call that cowboy lasagne around these parts
I make this and it is one of my favs but I use cream of mushroom soup in the meat I eat a bunch of this because it is flippin amazing
Oh, it's a modified shepherds pie !!
Dinner for tomorrow. Ty for the video. 😍
I didn’t know cauliflower tater tots was a thing. Yum
7:06!!!😂😂😂
It’s like shepherds pie but hyped up a notch 👌 some people used evaporated milk so weird 😂
This recipe sounded great! Very different than the one I make!
That casserole looks divine!
The tots should come out crispy not mushy.  I think she made it too soupy.  I'd leave out the mascarpone.
This would be delicious today on this cold blustery day. Checking my pantry now. 😊
Definitely going to try this version. I was brought up with the beef & onions/cream of mushroom soup/cheese/tots version (which is also ungodly good). This looks more like a shepherds pie filling version.
This looks delightful. Can't wait to try it!
YUUUUM. Next level Shepherd's pie ;) Mmmmm
Sort of a shepherd's pie sort of thing... nice...
Hey Laura! When you mentioned in your video here of making like a cheeseburger, I have added dill hamburger pickle chips served with ketchup and mustard on top. Yummo!!!!
Making this for dinner this weekend for my kiddos!
Now this is some good old midwestern comfort food right here!!! Love this dish! Had it a lot in college
Love this idea it’s like a super easy shepherds pie
Oh, yum!!!!!!!!!
than intro!! 😂😂😂
This is basically a more amazing version shepherds pie, amiright?
Yummmmmmmm💕👍🏼💕
Can you make cheeseburger soup?
women are always beautiful when cooking: D
Smells divine? Jesus smells like burger meat and tots? (He he I'm totally  joking of course.)
I may try this with turkey meat and peas (my family likes peas). You are so cute. Love watching.
I love this Laura's recipes.....but forever I thought she was the daughter of Mario Batali....because I had the names mixed up...LOL!  It doesn't really matter though....she is good!!
Hello beautiful Laura🌹😘 the taste of Italian..👍✌ 2019... Yummy😘
Taco version please!
Looks like more than a pound of beef 2  me Laura.
Im from Minnesota we call it tater tot hotdish and we put in peas as well one of my favorite childhood meals!
Mam after long time opload  video
I watch her videos for fun, I am on a fast!
Looks so good!!!
Gotta love it!
I use my Christmas kitchen stuff all year too, Laura, don't be embarrassed.  LOL!!
From the UK - what on earth is a tato top ?
Definitely going to make this!  Yummy!
Omg i so needed this!
This looks sooo good🤤🤤
Venom's favourite food.
Thank god you didn't call this tater-tot hotdish because minnesotans would be very upset
I love tots, and I've heard of the mythical tater tot casserole, but never looked into it myself.  Sweet Zombie Jesus.  I need this in my face now.
I've made it with seasoned Italian meat balls.....gooooooooood.
Still have the Cooking Channel gig?
I love tater tot casserole but this verse with the Worcestershire looks like it would be great.
She does not gain weight 😱 I want to know how lol
As a Minnesotan, I feel so disrespected. IT’S A HOT DISH
Cool 👍👍👍👍👍❤
U had me at the word cheese lol good video ty
oooooo im gonna make this this weekend! thanks Laura ! yes chicken pot pie version please
I have Christmas oven mitts in the my kitchen year round too. Lol.
This is my husband’s favorite meal! I will have to try this version!!
Your Tater Tot Casserole looks delicious.
Delicious!!!! 👍👍👍
When she says it’s not the kind of thing you’d eat a giant portion of 😂🤔❓❓ isn’t that the point 😂
Kind of like a Shepard’s pie? Looks good
Love tater tots yum 😋
Love this video
Love it girl!!!!
Kinda like shepherds pie! NEED to try this
She's cute and seems quirky
Laura, you’re so adorably goofy—it is gratifying to see a woman make no apology for loving good food!! We make this during the cold months, but the recipe we use calls for 1-2 cans of a “cream of” soup instead of the stock. I like your recipe better, I think.
I love you 😍
"i dont judge, I just eat" hahahahhahh
so midwest lol
That looks delicious❤️❤️❤️
😋😋😋 this looks amazing!!
like a tater tot shepherds pie
Tater thot 🤸🏼‍♂️
Thank you I have all those ingredients and I just smoked a fat jay can't wait to try
Shared. OH YEAH!!!
Trying this tonight thank you Laura xoxo
🙌😎😘
what would you use to make this vegetarian?
Hi laura can i make with ground chicken because we not eat beef please reply
Our family always uses green beans!
I think chives would have went better in this dish
Chicken pot pie version
I made a similar version of this last week, except I used ground pork, chicken stock, and frozen mixed veggies. It was so good! 😊
Mmm ooozy cheese🧀
So it's Sheppards pie
Also, if I was to make my own tater tots would I fry them and then put them in the casseroll or do I put them in just like that ?
I just made this with mashed red beans instead of the beef and veggie stock and it was so gooooood.  You are the kitchen master.
Yummy!!!!
This is a variation of shepherd's pie, you could go even easier and use potato patties. I did a version of shepherd's pie with ground chicken and poultry gravy, it was great. This is one for the books, amazing idea.
😋
I looks so delicious
You remind me of my coworker she’s a sassy little tater tot just like you and you’ve got to be the best mother adopt me please
So it's a shepherd's pie of sorts
Good recipe
I have never eaten or made a tater tot casserole but was tempted by this video! Followed it exactly, even. (When options, I went with the first thing.) It just wasn't as "wow" as I thought it'd be but it could be my ingredients. For example, the broth was low sodium and the tater tots were probably low salt too. But the leftovers got some doctoring and were much yes. The doctoring was sprinkling garlic powder on top (I had only done the dried chives), more salt, and a sprinkle of cheese (yes, there was cheese under too). And that really helped. So I blame the tater tots! This seems like such a versatile recipe too. Reminds me of beef stroganoff smashes into a pot pie. I can't wait to try it with different vegetables inside and on top! 

Thank you so much for sharing this easy to make comfort food dish :)
3:39 so cringe
I didn’t know anyone even ate taster tots; or that they were still made   Surprising thing to see  on a cooking channel.
Laura is Babe material
Excuse me, it is hotdish lol
Almost like Shepherds pie
Wheres the cream of broccoli soup ? Its my favorite
Thanks cutie
Looks yummy but nothing like the tater tot casserole we make in Michigan.
Eating this right now..
Yum!
Gonna make it tonight
Why is it not clear????
wooster
Ay guuuuuyeeees
XRYTHELP EVERY CONTENT CREATOR IS INVITED TO CHECK US OUT XRYTHELP !!!
What is a Tator Top thank you , and greetings from le Charente Maritime
Me likey
Can we leave the flour out ? Or use gluten free flour instead ??
This looks delicious, kind of like shepherds pie with tater tots.
Not gonna lie, I saw the title of this and my first question was, what the heck is a tater tot?
Che schifo😭😭😭
Wowww yumm just the looks of it!!!
What can you substitute for the corn that is more healthy?
QUIET.             3:01PM
yuuum
Mmmmm looks yummy! 😋
The least we can say is that it does not make you want even the color 😓
This is almost like a shepherds/cottage pie with tater tots rather than mashed potatoes. 😀
What are tater tots?
What can be used instead of beef for a vegetarian version?
do you thaw the tater tots first or use them frozen ?
This is basically a version of beef Shepard’s pie just with tater tots instead of mashed potatoes
I make mine the exact same way except just use cream of mushroom soup for the meat sauce.
Kind of like Sheppard’s pie.
Tator tots! YAHSSSS ❤️
WTF are "Veggie Tots?" Potatoes aren't Veggies? and why would you put "Veggie Tots" on top of Ground Beef?!?
So far I’ve tried your rice balls and today I’m making this. So far good
How come you don’t put the exact amount of items for your recipe, that sure help when making a dish.
So like a Shepard’s pie but with tots instead of mashed potatoes
u are bar none my fav chef to watch on youtube!!  :)
Why was she acting so weird
I like Laura and watch her all the time. I have made many of her recipes. This dish, however, looks very unappetizing. Sorry.
Cut up frozen veggies instead of tots on top is a good way to cut down on calories and carbs.
This is a Minnesotan dish, and it’s “Hotdish” , not casserole .
Basically Shepherd Pie with tater Tots instead of mashed potatoes.  Looks good.  👍🏼
Its almost like shepherds pie, just tots instead of mashed potatoes.... Looks great.
What in the white?
It’s called tater tot hot dish
Don’t have tater tots in the U.K. look like potato croquets to me.
As I go Google what tater tots are...
It's just like my shepherd's pie except I put mashed potatoes on the top instead of tater tots.
Similar to paté chinois (quebec version). Meat layer, layer of corn then topped with mash potatoes. Never tried cheese or cream in the meat. I’m going to try this for sure!
How can this be made into a freezer meal?
This is a recipe that I would like to recreate. I think your US Tater Tots are Hashbrown bites in the UK. I have to check it out. If I can not find it I shall use mashed potato and let it crisp up. I love dishes like this. They are easy to make, not much to wash up after dinner.
So so glad u are covering ur chest up....thank u !!!! Thank u !!!!
Are tater tots potato croquettes?
Would this be good with shredded hashbrowns as well?
As soon as you put the corn in it you lost me, sorry.
Laura, I love your recipes but I'm a pescatarian. Could you consider including substitutes for meat products for those of us with dietary restrictions? Love you!
It looks like  a Shepard's Pie with Tater Tots instead of Mash Potatoes...
Tater tots??? Really???
Why don't u at least mention the amount for the ingredients or list the recipe for us that do not a computer!!!
If the meat is too fatty 
If the meat is too lean 
If it is raining out 
If it at knight 
If I don’t have a oven 
If my mother in law comes over. 
 COOK, COOK ,COOK, 
That’s All COOK !!!!
You Talk TOO Much 
COOK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’
Does anyone ever wonder how much food she has in her freezer?😭
Benji needs to hook you up with the Japanese mayo!!!
The fact that yours is a real kitchen is what makes me want to watch your show, that and I think your an AWESOME person! 😊
Okay fine. I'm gonna make it today so you won't get mad... jeez
I worked at Ippudo NY for 3 years and Im so excited to make your recipe! If it tastes like the real thing (designed by Masashi Hirata) I will love you forever.
It is not ridiculous at all to love what you do Laura! I love your enthusiasm for cooking and have seen so many cool things on your channel that i was previously not aware of. Hope you keep "beeing ridiculous" forever. Greetings and much love from Germany. Have a wonderful Sunday!

Thank you so much for doing this recipe!!! I’ve been wanting to make these since forever lol they look sooooo delicious 🤤
The pork belly cooked so wonderful. Looks great in the buns. Yum mayo with it. 😊
OMG! Yummy!😋 Thank you Laura for sharing 👍🏼❤️

You know it's good when she quickly comes for the double bite!!!😂 YUM!!! Love me some pork buns!!
Yum!  Excited to remake this recipe.
The reason I go to Ippudo for years now is because of your early vlogs going there!! Thanks for sharing!!!! 🎉
Omg yes!!! FINALLY an ippudo pork bun recipe!!
ippudo has the best buns. if you've tried their vegetarian buns, the fried eggplant buns, could you please make a recipe video on it too? thank you!!
Beautiful Recipe. I wonder why your mayonaise is so thick? I thought this is your film kitchen?
I've had these at Ipudo and they are AMAZING!!😊👍
You really make everything look so delicious, Laura!! This level of excitement is so palpable!! 🙌🏼💗 I love it!!
Omg yes Laura!! I’ve been waiting for this since I tried Ippudo’s bao 😫😍
Another reason to love you Laura! Ippudo is incredible and I always get the pork buns as an appetizer. I can not wait to make this for our next gathering!
It's like an Asian version of pulled pork and the iceberg and mayonnaise is like when you put coleslaw on top of your pulled pork sandwich!! I will have to try this!
You are adorable. Love your videos/show❤️
char sui bao pork buns are great as well!!!
Brilliant!!! 🤣🤣
I love your videos...you inspired me to start my own channel ❤️  thank you 🥰
LOL...your excitement is hilarious. Love ya Laura!
You are so delightful. Bringing the best of recipes.Real kitchen with a special cook, wow.what is nice is you show enthusiasm.I adore watching. Thank you.
Laura just came across your channel recently xx. I'm obsessed love from Ireland x
love this! would love to see more restaurant inspired cooking.
Ippudo Westside in the city is just amazing !
I absolutely LOVE youuuuuuu!!!!  You are amazing!!!
Ippudo is my favourite Japanese chain restaurant. They're super popular here in Australia and even in Japan they're great!
I love how excited food makes you . It’s adorable 💛
In Hong Kong, we will deep fried the steamed bun and dip in condense milk (even the plain steamed one).  Believe you will love it (as you love condensed milk) ^^
When is the next video trip back to Italy 🇮🇹?
I don't Pork but her excitement makes me want to try it lol.  PS love you show
My favorite beautiful cooking chef love you Laura 😘😘❤️❤️❤️👀👌👌👌
It's like a BLT but without the tomato
I'm so excited about this recipe. When I went to NYC I went to ippudo and had their pork buns because you and Joe would always rave about them on your vlog channel. Can't wait to make them
They look great! Laura, can you please make coconut butter cookies? Thanks a lot!
I love Ippudo, fun fact I was there 2 days ago and had them, I get those everytime.
Made your version of Lomo Saltado and my family loved it!🍟🍖🍅
Please can you make vegan dishes 💜💜
The best part of this entire video is your sincere JOY over this recipe!!
Looks like a great Pork Belly recipe.
THAT'S! Why I like Laura V. The girl ain't no joke when it comes to her food 😂
Do you make rum cake? I grew up on that since birth and there's only one bakery in my state that makes it perfect. But would love to see a video on it😋😋😋
Yay! Ippudo always has such a long wait so this is a perfect recipe to try at home! And by home, I mean my tiny shared apartment in the city...
The ippudo pork buns are second best only to their fried chicken buns. Ughhhh so good.
Fascinating and Educational 👑💼
The pork belly slab seems to be skinless. So for crackling you can really have that crunch youre looking for even though you put the slab in broil. What gives you the crackling texture is the salted dehydrated pork skin (chicarones/lechon)
8:51 me lol
YESSSSSSSSSS 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Drooling 🤤😍
Omg yum looks so good!
I AM LIVING FOR THIS RECIPE, LAURA.
These look amazing. Amazon has the Japanese mayo. It's called kewpei mayo. I'll get the link if you like Laura.
These look incredible
I'll be making these tooo.. yummy
Hahahhaha this is you at your most excited state!!! This must be super amazing ...
Looks simply DELICIOUS! Def saving this recipe. I feel I can taste through the screen. Lol
Wow!! What a great recipe, looks super delicious!! Gonna give it a shot!
If you wanna be soooo happy so cheerful sooo amused just listen to the secret 👇👇👇👇👇👇 believe me(Quran)
@laurainthekithchen I tried this last weekend and IT'S DELICIOUS!!! if only I can send you the pictures. Now I am hooked and will be making it again tomorrow! Thank you!
Asian people that crush on Laura squad where you at
LAURA!!!! I just had some pork buns yesdtarday! And last week on my cruise ahahaha I love these things! They are magically delicious 😂🤣 I’m so glad you’re making these!
Has anyone else noticed she is bubbly and goofy more lately? Yes I know she has always been but it just seems to have kicked up a notch. You can tell how truly happy she is and its amazing. There were times while watching that it felt like she was just going through the motions but we all have those times. Love you Laura!! Keep it up!
I get them every time I go. They are so so delicious ❤️
I am so excited for this, my pork Belly is in the oven now. It took me 3 asian markets to find the buns, but I was also able to find Japanese mayo so I am super excited to make them.
Here in the philippines we called it siopao.😊
My mouth was watering!, Looks delicious Laura!
Can you do this with pork chops?
She is so much better than anyone on food network!🖒
“And then you put the lid on” 😂. I love that.
Looks amazing! 🤩 cant wait to try it!
I've been watching your videos since I was little now I'm grown. I love the way you cook I need to try one of your recipes
So what is it that makes these particular buns so special?
Made me hungry they look so good
Episode 1328
Please do a recipe for ramen 🍜
OMG!!
love watching you eat your gems
Oh my goodness....thats so delicious
Cooked it, simillar but not the same. In regards to sauces i am sure its teriyaki sauce, not hoisin sauce
Hi Laura. It looks good. I don't eat pork. Can I use either beef, lamb or chicken for this recipe? Thank u for posting this video. Can you show us your take on Korean food? I love Korean food as well as it is also one of my favourite cuisines.
Pork bun from the oven or bun in the oven? 🤔
@Laura in the Kitchen  I'm SO excited to make these Ippudo inspired pork buns. Gotta try your version and your recipe for it one day if I get the opportunity to make these. Thank you for sharing with us your recipe for it!
so jealous that looks so good
Laura, if you’re an Amazon head like I am, they sell the Japanese mayo on amazon! Just look up kewpie mayo, there is a 3 pack for less than $20!
nice recipe 👍🏻
I just like the cake base :D
I love your down to earth attitude when you taste. Btw that looks delish. Thank you Laura!
Mmmm. Time to tell the hubby to bring home the pork belly....for real, one of “our” restaurants is selling pork belly tacos, this may be the next pork belly menu ítem.
Amazon sells Kewpie Japanese Mayo.
Oh dear God, I will take you word on this...THAT looks so delicious! I will definitely be trying this!
I've watched Laura for so long and one of my favorite things has got to be when she says "put the lid on" when she's referring to the top part of the bun. Looks good! I might try this sauce with some chicken breast!
I ❤ your channel!!!
Loving the video!! 😍😍
I need to try these 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Vegana ni que nada ❤️
Is there an alternative beef cut that I can do this recipe with because I don't eat pork?
Looks so good
I wish their serving size was as large as yours. They’re so delicious!!
Thanks still at the royal pig las olas names louis come by fort lalud fl
😍😍😍😋
Looks so good!
Omg I literally had this yesterday what the heck 👀 thnxxxx Laura for this
1.8k likes and it just pops up
Cousin Laura!!!! SAUUUUCYYYYY! This looks delicious
Never ate these before. Dont you get alot of fat on the sandwich? Not a fat person. Just wondering
I love how natural you are.
Would like to try it first before I try recipe,does Chinese or Japanese restraunt have this on the menu?
Hello Laura ! You are very inspiring! I really love your videos ! I have been inspired to start my own Cooking Channel called The Recipe Therapist -helping people in the kitchen !!! I am Italian too but love to cook 👩🏼‍🍳 every kind of food -being from New York and a Big Family I have a lot to share ! Keep up these great recipes and God Bless you 👩🏼‍🍳❤️👍🥰 Celene -The Recipe Therapist!
muito bom
i don't eat pork. but just because your presentation and excitement watched the whole video. it looks so yum. tempted to give it a try.
The Japanese mayo is called kewpie mayo. Wegmans has it in the international aisle and Amazon has it too.
Looks good!! can I use beef or chicken instead of pork?
💕💕💕
Looks awesome, can't wait to try it.
Why is your mayo hard like cream cheese?
08:45
Hi laura  could u make the white lasagna u mentioned in your classic lasagna  video ?
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Yum!
It looks delicious! Just to let you know, we put mayo on anything and everything! meat, veg, Takoyaki, potato, rice...So, putting mayo on meat is just natural for Japanese! Def making this! You go giiirl!
🙂👍
That looks so bomb
now cooking
Wow! Thank you for this recipe. Im one of your youngest subscriber, and I’m glad you chose this exotic recipe! We love Ippudo. Try Japanese chiffon cake please, and also japanese fluffy pancakes
A must make. Soon.
Is the oven rack hard to clean after this?   I smoke meat on the racks - but I can place the racks in the dishwasher.
Your enthusiasm is catchy
♥️
Omg a must try!!
Yum yum
Great recipe Miss Laura. May I suggest you check out Chris @ MeatCranium site. He does some Keto recipes and just posted a wonderful pork wraped with bacon a Greek Tzatziki sauce, yum.
It takes me some doing to get a pork belly. I have to go downtown on a weekday during business hours! Next weekend, I'll make some. Probably gonna take a trip to the East Side to find the right buns. Which brand is best?
can i just come to your house to eat these lol?
I have literally been waiting for this recipe from you FOREVER! I KNEW you would come out with it one day! I found out about Ippudo because of you and I cannot go to NYC without going! SO WORTH THE WAIT! I’m lucky my mom lives there so I go a few times a year... I’m so excited to try this!!! Everyone needs to you will not be disappointed! :)
Wow, I've  never had pork belly before, but these look delicious!
Yummy 😋
割包啦！
Nice
That’s nice
Yummy
I came here to learn about the buns 😢 it is hard!!!
Anyone have any suggestions for other ways to top these?
New York native here baby and I’ve gone to Ippudo mad times and the pork buns are fire!!!!!
I'm going to make these tomorrow. they better be good!
Where do you buy pork belly? Have never seen it here in Indiana in a regular grocery store.
Wait I’m so late she had the baby awwwwwww
LOOK'D GOOD!!!!
Ken Peters saw a vision of the very last days, when there is a world system in place that stops you from earning a living unless you renounce The Lord. Big mistake, with nothing else to do, believers had 100% of their time to preach and there were huge revivals the likes of which have not been seen in all of History! Come Lord Jesus, and Holy Spirit blow through me to deeds greater than even He did on earth!!!
I’ve never seen buns like that.  It looks like raw dough.  I know it’s not because she said she steamed them, but just looks so strange to me.  Guess I’ll just have to try it.  👍🏼
Is it possible to make this with chicken instead?
WONDERFUL RECIPE !! I INVITE YOU TO MY CULINARY CHANNEL !!!
I WILL WAIT IN THE GUEST !!!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🌹😊
white shirt with tomato sauce. I would be covered and the shirt ruined LOL
I just wonder how you can make a dish like this wearing all white and not slop a drop on yourself! Impressive!
You haven’t made anything that I wouldn’t want to eat! Another great recipe Laura, you are a great blessing to the cooking community 😊
Celery, onion, and green bell pepper is called Trinity or Holy Trinity in New Orleans cooking.  A good creole seasoning is Tony Chachere's.
Cajun girl in da house..Whoop - Whoop!!  Put a little bit of butter in that sauce, Sha!
You had me at bacon and shrimp
This recipe was beautifully done. Loved the ingredients and the presentation.
Laura vitale + shrimp= immediate click
its always good when your meal includes "The Trinity" bell pepper, onion and celery♥
all great recipes. I have tried most of your recipes. love watching your videos
A one person serving if you LOVE shrimp!! Ha ha ha! 😄
Creole is my language in Mauritius,😉 n  this receipt in Mauritius without bacon it call Rougailles
Laura please make more vegetarian food especially Indian food... Love you
The way you say sauce is funny! 😂 Great recipe you used, the shrimp looks SWEET!😯😯😯
yum! can you make a seafood chowder?
I don't even like shrimp but Laura has me real tempted 😍
wait so shrimpS is not correct?😫 i've been saying that my entire life askshks
Shrimp addict😍😍
Leaving the tails on is just wrong and also inefficient.
I think I need to make this dish today to warm us up .....we woke up to  40 centimeters of snow in my city Ottawa, Canada ......gotta love it lol anyway looks yummy Laura❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow .AWESOME..perfect 👏👏
Yum, looks delicious Laura. You are brave wearing all white; I would be a complete mess 🙄
This will go great with "Tostones"  Fried green Plantains.
Laura, I lived on the Mississippi Gulf Coast for over ten years (right next to Cajun/Creole land) and this recipe you made is exactly how they make it down there. BTW my mother's family is from Solto Collina in the Trentino Alte-Adige (spelling?) region of northern Italy.
What kind of hot sauce? I assume Frank's?
I tried it and I loved it, with the exception of leaving the tail on the shrimp. It looked beautiful, but then I had to stop eating to removed the tail.
Wow!  I have made several Shrimp Creole recipes, this recipe is by far the best I have ever tasted.
Not only are you an amazing cook, you are one of the bravest women I’ve seen eating that whilst wearing white 👍 lovely recipe Laura, Thank you!
It’s very authentic though I would use andoiuille sausage instead
BTW: The onion, celery & bell pepper is called the Holy Trinity. The cajun version of Mirepoix. Thats a keeper recipe.
A lot of Cajun cooking uses what is called the holy Trinity , Bell peppers, Onion And Celery.
Laura cracks me up at how she admires her own cooking. “Look at daaaahh....” 😂❤️
I made this tonight.  It was super delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.
Made this 2 times and I love it! My favorite go-to shrimp recipe. I am tired of scampi and this saved me!
I made this and my boyfriend LOVED it. I bout cajun seasoning just to make things easier. Turns out I didn't like the seasoning but I would make again but just do chili powder garlic and onion and keep it simple
Let's make a deal you cook ill devour!!!!♥
Very nice recipe Laura ! I have a Cooking Channel too! Thanks for your inspiration and a very good Creole Recipe ! I will make and share this as well 👩🏼‍🍳🥰❤️ Luv Celene!  
The Recipe Therapist!!
Can you make shrimp Mozambique please. 😊
Glad to see you're warming up to green peppers +++
It's 11:21pm and I'm sitting here watching this episode of food and it's making me hungry..
I love her. Her recipes are good, too.
Laura she is beautifully as she cook yummy
haha "I want some of that SAUCCCEE"
Serve it over rice. That's the way we do it here.
Can you please make chocolate fudge cookies? Thanks a lot <3
Yummmm that looks really good BUT I tell you if that was me cooking this with a white top, I'd be all red stained and still eating those shrimp :)
Smoky spicy SWAUCY
Laura, grazie per continuare a mostrarci buone ricette!  È buono vederti mostrandoci l'amore nella cucina.  Buon San Valentino!
My mouth is now a waterworks 
Oi
I've never been into shrimp, also have never cooked it. So this might be my first shot. Wish me luck! D:
Looks great! I'm gonna make it today
Go girl!!
Cousin Laura!!!!! I can get down with that too!!! I wonder how spicy it is
This is one that definitely I will try. Thanks to take your time to share to us. I didn't see little helper in this one.
Could u please make a jambalaya pasta?
Hi happy valentine's day
The shrimp looks so delicious!
Prawns with bacon Mmmmm ok
Bomb ❤️🤩
Loose your channel!!! Where are your frying pans from???
I love your shrimp recipes😍
What would you use to replace green bell peppers for those who suffer from allergic reaction to them?
Beautiful meal
Italian women are known for being homemakers and cooks. Russian women are known for gymnastics and athletics. Have you seen those bikini fitness models?!
Perfect and delicious
Valentine's day cake or cookies plzz
now cooking
Oh boy that looks to good
Laura, you should listen to yourself at 6:19 when you said “sauce,” you sounded like such a Jersey girl!! 😂
Pls if I don’t have bacon what’s the alternative
Can you substitute shrimp with chicken?
Nothing is up there ☝️☝️☝️ LOL! 😊
🙏🙏😘😘😘😘
I want to marry a italian woman.😍
Good food 🍤🍤🍝
Love you Laura!
I thought she would upload a valentines dessert recipe
I am gonna make this but with chicken or beef since I don’t eat shrimp 🍤 and what could I use instead of bacon 🥓 I don’t eat pork either. Thanks.
Good afternoon👋 this looks wonderful
Shrimpy's
Yuuuuuum I absolutely love love shrimp!! This looks deeeeeelicious, it’s lunch time in Toronto and This is making me soooo hungry :)
Laura are you pregnant
Better
Oh my word !!!!
looks good.  but not really shrimp creole.  for a more authentic shrimp creole, you need to start with a roux, you need chopped tomatoes, not just tomato sauce, and this must be served over rice.
Looks good.
Who else eats while she cooks
How about cooking the shrimp in the sauce? Will that hinder the flavor?
Didn't that Shrimp look like RUBBER when she tried to cut it with a Fork?
😋
I don't care for shrimp, but gonna give this a go, my hubby and boys will love this!
Looks good! 😀
Mmmmm Looks bangin I just made your clam chowder recipe I’m just waiting for it to cool down so I can eat, I’ll probably make this recipe tomorrow :)))
Thanks
so wonderful
Che bella donna!
Can you please make Oreo truffles!!
WOW  😅😅😅
Yummy
Please cook Vietnamese rice dish. these are really attractive dishes
I’m making this this weekend!!
I don't enjoy shrimp or spicy things - but I am willing to try this.
Mmmmm my mouth is watering
If
Pepper ? Sweetness ?
Will appreciate if you put down the ingredients for easy access...thank you
I speak at schools often and use Laura as an example of how a student could become an amazing chef. I suggest they recreate her recipes and videos to learn and build an online resume. Her videos and food are amazing. Keep up the great work.
Lol Mia is the new citrus queen move over Laura!!!!
Mia our little sous-chef 😍
Mia in the kitchen!! ❤️ this is so rustic and beautiful! I love anything citrus. My daughters baptism is coming up next weekend, this would be such a beautiful dessert to display!
I have no clue why, but your videos have a very watchable feel. You’re not doing anything amazing or something unachievable by anyone else willing to put in the effort... but I think it’s worth mentioning to you that you have a really nice, maybe comforting, watchable quality.
Mia is the cutest😫🤣
I’m sorry Laura did you say something. Baby Mia ❤️❤️❤️
OMG Mia is sooooooo cute !! Your pavlova looks out of this world!! i will make the same, but thunking of replacing the curd with pastry cream and top with berries !!
Mia’s adorable!!!
Can you please make chili cheese fries?!?
Super beautiful and delicate looking cake.
Mia is so precious and adorable!! she loves to help her mama so much, i love it. also i really liked the little "flashback" part with the citrus prep! 
EDIT: i cannot with that cross section!! it looks like a cloud!
Wowzers she's gotten so big & Beautiful ...
Hugs & Love to you and your family...🤗😍🙇‍♀️😘
Laura’s baby!!! I can’t!! 😩😩
Mia is too cute. Stop. Oh my god.
Cousin Laura!! I actually think the cracks add character
Definitely a moment for them to remember, "I want to cook". Haha, even as a toddler she wants to be a chef. 5:43
😎I love Laura in the kitchen.😍
You could always run coarse sugar through the food processor to make it fine. Just make sure to use less because it’s more condensed.
OMG she's so big now and looks just like you!
This looks delicious! I've never thought of putting citrus with creamy desserts, because the acid would split the cream but you proved me wrong!
Omg Mia is super cute and looks like her daddy!
Oh my goodness, Mia and the orange, just too cute! PS great recipe!
That looks DIVINE! I love any kind of sweet that has citrus.
Mia made my day. She is absolutely amazing!!! Wonderful video and recipe, as usual, Laura!! <3
Love Your videos  made many of your dishes, I must say that sweetie is your twin.
looks just like your mini.
Keep doing you.
OH MY GOODNESS Mia has grown up so beautifully 😍

Never even heard of this...

I love sour foods so I might actually put LEMON slices on it.
Laura GOOD JOB : ))
GReetings from Brazil...love your recipes Laura :)
Pretty pavlova, beautiful Laura, adorable Mia. This video has everything!
The way Mia looks up at you and smiles when you tell her “good job” 😭😍
Please make a german chocolate cake
Laura you 
Are not alone with getting he Parchment paper straight! I am the exact same. I get so frustrated but I say "Oh well! It works!" Lol. This looks Amazing! I'll have to try it!
P.s I have a almost 5 year old I named Mia! I just love the name! Your daughter is the cutest lil chef.
your daughter's little wave at the end is adorable! So precious. I really love your Pavlova. It looks so yummy. Perfect for the spring and summer.
Love pavlova yum
Mia  cute little lady
Wow looks amazing.. you're little angel melts my heart, so cute x
Mia sniffing the orange & saying; "Ahhh" made me stop the video to laugh. out. loud. Best intro ever.
Gets more excited when mia's in the video!! ❤️❤️
She is so adorable. That dessert looked amazing!!
Cuteness overload with Mia! 😍🤩
Love the oranges that you use so fresh and there's a bright beautiful color and Mia is the cutest little chef ever. ❤️
Beautiful cake! Great job
Mia is so adorable!!  Every time she smiles and looks up at you, soooo cute. God Bless her and you and your family.
The baby in the kitchen on a chair... that’s an Italian kitchen🌸💕🌸. Somethings never change in life.
OMG Laura my mouth is watering......😘
And I must say she’s adorable. God bless you guys!
Mia is so beautiful!💕
She is so cute just like a bunny. 🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
Laura, next time try inverting your pavlova onto the serving dish.  The crust, which is now on the underside, stays much crispier and your filling goes on the meringue part which is now on the upside.  That's the way my Mum taught me to do it.  It works every time. Mia is certainly growing up fast!
“Mama and Mia”, I love her in the kitchen with you 😁!!!! That looked scrumptious!! 💕
That was the cutest intro!!!!🥰😍😍😍
Such a good idea when strawberries are out of season!!  Ur a genius 😘
baby Mia is absolutely precious!!
Thank you so much for adding that little clip of Mia in the beginning!! So cute 😍
I really like how you built the mini-tutorial into this video.  Your daughter is adorable.
Omg your daughter is too CUTE 💕
2 stunning creations!💜
Is this crisp and dry in the middle or soft and marshmallow-like? Also can you use citrus flavoring instead of vanilla?
Laura, what fun watching your daughter...you are such a good momma!
Love you bouth my two favorit beauties... 😍😍😍😘😘😘👀👀❤️
You make cooking look easy!! I love watching all your videos thanks, your lil girl so adorable!
Cuteness=Mia (and Mom)!
She’s a mini Laura ❤️ looks EXACTLY like her!!

Your tomato dish is adorable. Love it.
Mia is soooo cute and the pavlova looks gorgeous !! 👌👌

Omg!!!she soooo cute😍😍😍
Mia is so cute. Looks good.
I love pavlova I have mine with strawberries and vanilla cream, pavlova is a  New Zealand desert and is a favorite here in New Zealand.
Can we use blood orange laura or grapes?can we use normal white vinegar?
Glad to see ur chest more covered !!!
That was so cute u showed mia sniffing the orange
wow mia seems to never age
How are there thumps down??
You should make Moussaka.
Mia "i want to cook" 😍😍😍
Awww Laura! Mia is Soo cute! 😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
Looks delicious!!! Mia is sooo cute!!! Mommy’s helper sooo sweet!!! 🥰
Good ol Aussie recipe!
6:39 oh my gosh her smile is the sweetest!!
I love citrus but...I’m allergic to it. Still eat it tho 😂😂
I wonder if I could do this with segmented citrus instead of slices?  The rounds seemed awkward to eat.
can we do some Rainbow Cupcakes and if you use the Grill do you need to be careful
Mia is so cute 😍😍😍🌹🌹
I love this idea! I saw Paul Hollywood make a Christmas wreath pavlova it was gorgeous  but I think this citrus one is even better because it just makes me think of a Sicilian dinner with a view of the ocean.
2nd 😃❤️
Let's be honest. No one was looking at what Laura was doing as soon as Mia got there haha
I love pavlova😍😍
New series of Mia in the kitchen pls!!
Mia is sooooo cute 😍 her smile 😃 she’s so big already

Looks delicious!
Beautiful darling 💋yummy 👍🍷💋
That looks yummy 😍
👍👍👍👍
I really love the fact that even when she disturbs you or does something bad you just pretend like it is a masterpiece and motivate her!
😍
also these guest appearances are like "Mommy and Me" but it's "Mommy and Mi(a)"!  lol i crack myself up
Nice winter cake!, it’s citrus season!.

i'm only here for mia
You talk to your daughter the same way I talk to my dog
mia valentina <3 !!!!
mia so cute
Mmmmmmmm omgggg that looks great!!
Another great dish! Mia is adorbs! 💛
This is my favourite dessert in the entire world.  We have it for birthdays and Christmas every year - minus the oranges on top, but that lemon curd, meringue and cream combo? Yummm
Just wait until Mia is old enough to realize what YouTube is and have her check out some of Laura's older videos when she just started her channel.  :D  Always fun to show kids stuff from our childhood.... they're all like, 'what is that?', 'how does that work?', and 'wow.... so.... non-electronic'.  hahahah!
Beautiful
That looks Dalish! Random question here, I am very lactose intolerant, can you do a few appetizers with cheese, creams please, I’ve searched lots of YouTubers but haven’t found any, can you please help🤗
Yummy 😋
So cute how she cooks with you
Hey mate I’m Australian (the pavlova is an Australian food. I’m sorry my Kiwi friends but it is). This looks beautiful and my Grandma makes a very similar pav. May I suggest that you try using passionfruit pulp when they are in season in your area. No other fruit. Beautiful pav, lovely cream and passion fruit. You will thank me 😘😘😘😘
Nice
Mia ♥️
Mia is so cute! Her eyes are so cute, I love how she loves to help in the kitchen! She’s so so so so cute!❤️
That looks good! But too bad I can never have that, allergic to eggs :|
Omg I’m totally going to make this tomorrow!!! Also Mia is super cute!!!!
Mia needs her own apron that momas little cook on it
i wanna see what your kids think about your dishes too!
Sugarbomg

You haven’t made anything that I wouldn’t want to eat! Your awesome Laura!!! 👨‍🍳
Laura, with all those fabulous receipts I' m surprised that you are not 500 pounds.
How many of you noticed that she got her nails done whilst it was slow cooking
My mouth is watering. This meal looks so so so good.
i made your sweet and sour chicken it was phenomenal. i will be trying this one too
I get so excited when you post traditional Italian recipes! I know you’ve done pretty much everything already but these make me so happy! This looks like everything I want to make on a Sunday when it’s raining outside and I’m in my pajamas all day! 😍 I bet the house would smell amazing too. Do you know why your nonna doesn’t put any garlic in sauces like this? For some reason I can’t wait my head around that lol
Can you please make chili cheese fries??
Hey laura! 
I watched your videos when i was little and i loved them now that im 6/5years older i searched for your channel! And found it thank god!😍
OMG this looks amazing exactly what I need on today in snowy Toronto Canada , thanks for sharing!!!

Absolutely fantastic.  Tried it on stove and instant pot 70 min.  So good
Thanks so much! I'm making this tonight...I can't wait. Another wonderful video and recipe
This looks delicious! Thank you for sharing 😊
I’ve listened back a couple of times to catch the Italian word for your sauce 
Strogoto? Help!
Yum! I think I'd use pappardelle instead of fettuccine
This is a Recipe I can sink my teeth in, once I make it I’ll give you a heads up on how it goes 👍.
Yum! I haven’t ever tried making this but now i will! Thanks Laura 😍
"It feeds a small army"
Sooo me.
I shouldn't watch your vids when I'm hungry. You are so awesome!
I can't wait to see your instant pot recipes! There's so many facebook groups with loads of information. Just type in Instant Pot Community and join the group. That's how I learned everything about it. :)
Love youuuuu and your recepies❤️
I wood love some more small videos about tips and tricks in the kitchen. Food, freezer and fridge. 🤗
Would love to see more about your journey with the InstantPot.  I received mine over the holidays, and didn't expect to use it much, but it's quickly becoming my go to weeknight solution.
Would you consider this low carb?
Laura is Neapolitan and very proud of it ....viva Napoli
Delicious 😋 Italiano darling thanks🍷👍💋
Wow Laura! That looks so yummy. I love making a good ragu, but I haven't made one quite like this. I cant wait to try it!
At the last minute, I added garlic powder.  And I'm so ashamed.  😧
This looks soooo good!! Can't wait to make it at home! 🌸
Making this today. Thanks Laura !
I love the Laura in the Kitchen.  You make it fun and things look amazing.  Everything, I have made, (and that is a lot) has been wonderful. Thanks for bringing us these delicious recipes.  My son in law, thinks I am the best cook he has ever known. LOL
Excellent Laura!!! 🇮🇹👌🏻
“The worlds your pickle” haha I love it
Looks so good but i will have to substitute the beef though...will do all pork
It reminds me of beef stroganoff but with carrots and no diary. Love you videos
As I watch you, I wonder if Nefertiti cooked.  They should have used your features for the modeling of what she might have looked like.  ♥️ from Ursula.
coming from the chocolate strawberries video - you've gotten a lot better over the years!
This looks amazing! Thanks for sharing Laura. Could you possibly do some instant pot recipes? I'd love to see the different ways to use it.
That so looks so good, my mouth is watering! I need to make this!
Sei l’unica cucina bene molto brava
My nonna made something similar. Yum!
Would lamb work well with this?
“hey, the world’s your pickle, so you do you.” -Laura Vitale, 2019
Oh dear so yummy recipe 👍👍❤❤😍😍
Please! 😭speak little
Why dont you just use a big food processor?
Love seeing you on food network!
We love Laura in the Kitchen! ❤ 🍝🍕🧀🥩
Great recipe Laura, thanks
Another great recipe  ❤❤
Please! Tell me how to make this in a crock pot!!
Hi Laura , this looks yummy thank you 😊
Needs Garlic!
you made me soooooo hungry at 10am ! it looks sooooooooo yummy omg  can't wait to try it !
Oh, my... that looks so, so good!!
Amazing recipe Laura!
The cameraman should keep in touch with whatever Laura gonna throw in or cooking not focus only on Laura’s face and smart enough to know what people want to see not only swing the camera everywhere.
Wowww i love you 💕
Laura what can I use instead of carrots because im alergic??????!!!!
Omg!!...you are amazing👏🏼👏🏼. Thank you so much 👍🏼.
Isn't it like Genovesse? so delicious!
Turning the vegetables into a paste like mixture before pan frying it reminds me of South East Asian cooking, like Laksa
Can I make this recipe with Lamb?
Very nice, one of your best shows.
I'm making this right now and the house smells amazing!  Just 2 more hours and whoooohooo!  Can't wait!
Cousin Laura you better treat yourself!!!
Laura, what is the brand and size of the pot you used in this video?
You are amazing!!
She didn't even chew it a little bit!!
Love this video
@5:47  I thought that was the vinegar for a second!
This dish is LIFE 😋😋😋😋😋
Not for none alcoholic like me😟😟
I really like that pot. Wonder what brand it is.
I’m gonna try this recipe slightly cheating t by making lil Indian Indian way nd halal way (ignoring the pork nd alcohol). And I’m gonna Use pressure cooker 😝😝 cuz I don’t wanna use more of gas
Yummy, I do it at home
This looks so yummy! You should also go watch Gochujang Mama, she cooks too! :)
Wow 
Madiha shaybo's kitchen
I ❤ MEAT SAUCE 😋
Will it taste different if I cook it in a slow cooker?
No garlic? 😳
This one looks SO GOOD!! I bet it tastes just as good as it looks <3
I like this recipe.
Love this video!!
Lol I love when you say you do you lol
Looks so yummy can’t wait to fix it thank you Laura
Looks delicious 😋
looks very good i will try it thank you
If I use the instant pot (as a slow cooker and after meat is seared) should I cook the whole thing for 4 hours?
Looks so yummy!
She is very sweet and i feel that am with her in her kitchen lol
Yummy🤩🤩
I make this for Pappardelle, sooooo good.  😋
I like beef to eat stew noddles
Wow nice rack!! Always envied your ability to maximize space when storing spices! As always lovely video! Hola desde Italia!!
yumm!!!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
May I ask why ytou are not using your slow cooker for this dish since it is a slow cooking dish? I love my slow cooker but , when I need to thicken my sauce * which happens * I can not do it in it, so I have to fill it all in a regular pot to thicken it. That is the only thing that I do not like about the slow cooker. Your dish looks super tasty.I think I want to cook this on Sunday.
Saved this baby!
Make Indian dish
😋
Amazing
The trouble with the fettuccini.... And you call yourself and Italian!!! LOL J/K ;-)
I'm so hungry...
Thanks
Yummy. ️ ❤️
LOOK'D GOOD!!!!! I'LL HAVE SOME!!!!!
you say you listen to nona... but what about the whole white pepper debate..
Besides the no garlic and putting the veggies in the food processor, this is exactly how I make my pot roast. I never thought about it being a pasta sauce. I gotta try that.
💗💜💗
Yummy
Mmmm....my gosh!! @Laurainthekitchen, I know I say this A LOT while watching your videos, but....I reeeally wish I had a smell'aphone!!  
Just one thing...if I don't want to use wine, (I will if it's a must), is there a substitute?
Hey
That don’t look good
Can you please make white chocolate oreo brownies or chocolate coated bacon? Thanks a lot!
Can you please make white chocolate oreo brownies or chocolate coated bacon? Thanks a lot!
Can you also have rice with it?
Hai
Can I do it with chicken
I can’t drink alcohol. Do you think it cooks out? 😕
Laura, mi piaciono moltissimo i tuoi video!  Have you considered popularizing your channel in Italy?  The cooking shows from Italy that I have been watching focus mostly on traditional recipes (le ricette tradizionali).  What you can offer to old-country Italian viewers is a glimpse of the evolution of Italian cuisine in America.  If you do, putting Italian subtitles in your videos may help.  You may also want to introduce yourself in Italian.  Viva la cucina italiana!
She aged!
No one likes a thin bottom no tea no shade
Please stop saying ‘you do you’ in your videos all the time now.
A tip about turkey bacon. Look for the uncured turkey bacon (Trader Joes has a good affordable one). The uncured one is way less processed and has like 4 times the protein.
Yes Laura I'm on Keto these are perfect!! Thanks 🙂
More Keto-friendly recipes please,  Laura!
How long will the 'muffins' last in the fridge?  Four days?  Can these be frozen???
Its like omelet in a cup :)? 🥰🥰🥰
“Cup of coffee”. Says she while moving out of the way her repurposed, 2 gallon flower pot filled to the rim with the life-saving, mind-fixing precious liquid.
Who thinks that Laura in the kitchen has the most episodes on YouTube
I am feeling the size of that coffee mug 🤪 #momlife
I Love, Love, Love all your recipes but I'm doing Keto.  This is the first recipe I can have!  Thank you!!!!!!!!
Keto anything please!
They look perfect !!! Great for week meal prep:) I like ce how puffy they are, I know you mentioned they deflate but still they look yuuuuuuum !!!thanks for sharing :)
Omg I loveee those little egg muffin frittatas!! Whenever I roast veggies, I even chop them up the morning after and throw them in along with some gruyere. I love eating them on a slice of toast with an avocado and tapatio on top! ❤️❤️
Cousin Laura did you say hot sauce?? You have hot sauce in your bag? :)
I loved it when you said" OH!" and looked over at the thing that beeped- you are so funny!
More low carb, keto recipes please! Thank you!
Yes I would love to see something grab and go for busy work days! Do these freeze well?
Delicious food.. Great video thank you .. I’m low carb and this works for me 😍❤️

Just what I need! I'm going to make these right away! Thanks for sharing!
OMG I make them all the time and everyone loves them 😍😍😍
Very impressed that although you got your own cooking show you still have time for us
How are you not married! You're gorgeous and you can obviously cook.
She said “oh!!” Lmao
that is really really big cup of coffee 😁
Thanks for the tip on liners !!  I make a meatless version of this and have issues with it sticking sometimes.
how long will they keep? do you keep them in the fridge or outside? can you freeze them?
Oooo I'm excited to try these!!!!
I always eat omelettes with hot sauce and these are essentially cute little portable omelettes so you are definitely on to a winner here 😍
I tried this and it was delicious, the only thing was that it was a bit dry.
Super like! Those babies look amazing!!!
what is the measuremen of all purpose?
Looks amazing!!!
Im defenately going to make these! 🤩
Gosh, I’m meal prepping today to start a new diet to lower my A1C, and I couldn’t have found a better recipe! Good for me.
Laura, I love watching your videos and have made several of your recipes successfully. Recently, I’ve been very into making bread and getting to work with yeast. I was wondering if you could make a video on how to make a sourdough starter and then make sourdough bread. This is my absolute favorite kind of bread and would love to see how you would go about it. Thanks for all the wonderful recipes you have provided! Keep up the great work!
It's 2am and I'm watching this 😥
Maybe do a series healthy low carb recipes
These look so yum!!!! I am making them tomorrow morning. XO
Wondering if these would be equally as good (and re-heat as well) doing 1/2 parts whole egg and egg whites??
I made these before and they didn't work out well. I see the key to my problem is the parchment muffin cups. I'll be ordering some, soon.
Hey can you show how to make a schnitzel?(Don't shout me out)
You are so naturally beautiful!
YUM I love the Starbucks sous vide egg bites and this reminds me of them
Luv this Laura! :)
Can you make a Rueben sandwich?
Low carb grab ‘n go would be 👍
Thanks Laura, they look great for early morning rush.
Well that's one hell of a cup of coffee !! LOL that's the way to goooo !
They look amazing.
Silicone muffin work fantastic
Perfect diabetic breakfast.  👍.
Looks so good <3
Definitely gonna make this very soon vth my take on it & tagging you soon on Instagram! Xoxox 💕
Thanks Laura! Looks great, wish you would have shown us the worst one, not the best one so we would know what to expect.
Can you please make chocolate coated bacon? Thanks a lot
looks tasty!
Looks so easy!! I have to try! Thank you, Laura!
Laura what brand stainless steel pots and pans you are using to cook
Cold with hot sauce!!! Speaking my love language
More low carb recipes please!!!!
I think I’ve been asking for like 5 years to share a chicken salad sandwich recipe.. I’ve tried them all and never found the “perfect” one. And I love all your recipes. Pls make it❤️🙏🏻
More keto recipes please 🤗
hey what brand are those paper liners? we dont have them in australia.
Will have to make those for sure
I don't know Keto!!
What's that??
BTW,
I 
Have 
Also Cooking Channel.!!
Is it me or her neck looks green? 😱
Are you ever gonna do a “What I eat in a day” video?!!😍
I like making these with sausage and using spinach and red peppers with onion and adding some seasonings!! So yummy!!
More of these, please.
Can you please do chili cheese fries!?!?
Going to make some tomorrow morning. Thank you.
Looks delicious! 😍
Made these last night and you were right didn't use the parchment cups and it did stick to the regular ones :( wasn't a total loss but well you know.
I made these today w/ sauteed onions and diced ham, then topped with pepperjack cheese!
😍😍😍😍😍
Those look fantastic! I am going to make those tonight and pop them in the freezer if you think they will freeze well. Those will be perfect for a grab and go breakfast.
looks divine
Look delicious,  but don't make too many as they are best eaten straight away as omelettes are of course.  I've made these  before and they don't taste as nice when cold. And re-heating them spoils the texture.
Hi Laura , your recipes are so wonderful.These are so useful to make . Thank you.
can someone give me the aproximate macros since i am on keto!
Eggs and nopalitos!
Are these freezer friendly?
I really like that grater you used. Could please tell me where to find it?
They look YUM!!!!
now cooking
It's like an omlet cupcake hehe
Yes!!....need to drop 8# after the holidays so this will go great with my low carb diet! ( I can sure see those in puff pastry cups too!!..lol)
I just made them and they turned out so yummy
Quiche cups!
Bring out the peppers and sausage.
First
They look good!
Simple and delicious.
How to fry caned corn
Please make Amish oatmeal like Maureen’s Kitchen in Smithtown LI NY. They call their’s baked oatmeal. It’s outstanding and has a secret recipe. Truly the best.
Yum!
Looks yummy!!!! I love western omelette and it’s look just like,right?!👏🏼👏🏼🤩😍
Very nice idea for breakfast
Use egg as motar for the bricks of flavor
Thanks Laura for your delicious recipes! I have enjoyed watching your channel and you have inspired me to start my own channel. This is a new adventure for me! Your Awesome!
Everything that I have cooked from your recipes has been great!  Your videos keep getting better and better as your humor comes through! Can't wait to cook these!
It seems like she really loves them!😂😄
Do you not post the recipes the same day as the episodes?
Kind of like a muffin omelet.
Looks delicious
They are sooooooooo good
Hi
Just did my own version of Bacon Egg Muffin. Tasted just like fluffier scrambled eggs and bacon. Yummy!
Nom nom nom
Oh !
How long would these be good for in the fridge?
👍👍👍😘😘😘🌹🌹🌹
Great idea xxx
Yes!!!! Mushrooms, onion and sausage!!!!
Great
Def trying these out yum
I made these tonight for meal prep. Chile rellano and jalapeno popper flavored. I tried a few broccoli cheese but they were watery.
Yummy
Love
Looks delicious and so simple! Def trying this one tomorrow!! 😋😋
YUM
Can you mix a little corn bread in the mix and what will it do?
Yay I’m here early!
Where are the instructions how many eggs etc?
I can’t find the written recipe with ingredient amounts etc
I just made these. They where lovely 😊
My sister makes these all the time
Your not the first one to make little baby Fritatas
yus
For 5 years I make jumbo muffins with Eggbeaters & Jimmy Dean Skillets which has onion, potato, red & green bell pepper and sausage. Salt & pepper. Cheese is optional. Bake 40 min in 350-400 degrees.
Laura's Lingo Translation - A little bit of Salt = Shove your hand in the jar, grab as much salt as you can hold and dump it in the recipe.
I make these too!!!!  delicious and easy!!!  I normally do bacon, onion, tomatoes and a bit of feta.... sometimes mushrooms too!
Mmmmmmmmm i love these stop it right now
I'am going to make that? They are so delicious
Hmm - I want to try this with Pancetta Salami. When you break it and cook its like bacon. It's delicious too. Lots of fat but then on Keto fat isn't evil.
I make these with zucchini and asiago cheese....SO DELICIOUS! I’ll try the peppers and onions tomorrow, thanks Laura!
These are like egg omelettes in a cup.  These are not muffins.
These look so good!! I’d love more of these “healthy” but yummy recipes. Maybe even something Whole 30 compliant?
Please don't say 'veg' anymore..... it sounds like 'vag' and that's just disturbing... ;-)
Wow!  That's a LOW CUT top!!!   Modesty might be an ingredient needed in these videos.
Can you please make chili cheese fries!?
Ok, now I am hungry. Loved the way they came out with that golden outer crust. Yummm
Laura You are a sweetheart 😊❤️
Thank you for a recipe with ground chicken.  I live in India and beef is forbidden. So I can’t do some of the recipes, but I will definitely do this one 🤗
You had my attention at "ranch" =P. These looks so delicious, Laura! I can't wait to try this =)
Laura uploads a video instantly stops what I'm doing and watches. Definitely gonna make this looks so good💕💕
I might make these next time I have friends over. Top shelf recipe for sure Laura, thank you 😊
I'll definitely try this one. Thanks Laura for sharing!!
That looks delicious! Definitely going to try it! 🌸
Looks amazing😋
You should do more recepies using chicken meat😊
When I saw this title, before I played it, I knew it was gonna be amazing and become one of my favorite recipes! I was right! I need to make them STAT! They look phenomenal!!
They look sooo good!  This would also be great for meatballs....I'm guessing with some bread crumbs added.
Every time I see your notifications I click so quick ! Love your recipes ! 😻
I love Laura’s stuff. She’s brilliant and creative
The burgers look good and juicy but idk about that garlicky sauce 🤷🏾‍♀️
I’m sure it taste good but I might squint while tasting. 👀
So yummy! The sauce looks delicious! Thanks for all the awesome tips! 💗😊👍🏻
Could you bake these? If so what temp and how long? 
Can’t wait to make them!!
I’ll definitely be  trying this recipe. They look delicious. 👍🏻😊❤️
It’s been cold lately can you make a good soup 🍜
That's a nice looking box grater. Where can I find one like that?
That is hilarious. I find ground chicken way more moist than for example ground beef.
Been watching your spaghetti squash lasagna video over and over....that will be our meal tonight...Can't Wait.  Thanks so much BLESS BLESS
thank you laura I love your videos and your recipes
Hi new to your channel I went through some of the meals my goodness so good 😊 as a

Chicken burgers are low-carb.  Diabetic-friendly! 👍
Looks delicious 👌🏼😋 sending love from South Africa 🇿🇦
I've made these several times since first seeing this. They're not just good; they're REALLY good. A definite keeper.
Love this! And your sweater! Where is it from??
😋yummyness & you are wonderful😍 &making this delicious chicken burger with amazing yogurt sauce☺😍😘👼👼👼
Love that you used zucchini. Good for someone looking for low carb. Cant wait to try this Laura! Been watching you for years now. Please make a meat pie! We love them here in Canada 😍
Best line... We cook it, we serve it, then we eat it! Love it💕✌🏼
This recipe was perfection! Could not believe how moist they were and honestly didn’t need the yogurt dressing. Thanks Laura!
Love this....definitely want to try it out. All your videos are wonderful!
It's definitely going to be on my table soon. They look amazing.
Excellent video! Kudos on your hands. So great to see obviously 'clean' hands cooking food compared to 'hidden' fingernails. Personal preference I'm sure but nice to see anyway!
Yum teach me lady it's delicious.
Wow, that looks realy tasty. I should try making this. -SKC
6 minutes each side. It looks really delicious 👍👍👍
Yay!!  I'm the 54,334th viewer!
I’ve entered the episode no. and recipe name but can’t seem to find it😩❤️
Will definitely be making these.
This looks delicious! Yum! The burgers are also a good way to sneak in your veg which is always a plus :D
Umm yummy.
Thanks for the yummy recipe.
Mrs. Vitale.. are you related to Sal and Anthony Vitale from brooklyn.....?
We don't need the bun!
Yum. I have to make these chicken patties and the sauce. Putting the ingredients on my grocery list now.
Can I skip the ranch mix?
What other things can you use the Yogurt Sauce for?
Can you cook patties in the air fryer ?
Looks amazing Laura
Make Indian butter chicken!
Can you these as meatballs? Instead?
Yum yum! yes please!
Laura, I can tell something is on your mind or you are upset about something :-(  Can anyone else tell?
Like ✨👍
You should be a judge on masterchef. Your just like a female version of Gordon Ramsay.
Looks ike you’re on a bit of a healthy journey! Nice of u to join us! I’ve watched your channel for years, but can’t eat most of the things that you prepare, no gluten dairy sugar ect. 
But lately your plates are looking more like mine! Thats great!
your the  best
Looks really good ... Thank you,  Laura
Can an egg be used in place of the Zucchini?
Clever way to sneak veggies in on the kiddos!!
Can you grill the burguers on a grill outside? Like during the summer
This is a good keto burger.
Making this 😍
Yummy!  I'm looking forward to making these!💖👑💖
Loved this video
I'm wondering if zucchini would help /work in ground turkey. I'm guessing sure why not.
Hello chief, I have a request. 12/12/19, Thursday, my 50 th. Birthday, could you cook for me? I’m up in RI. I’ll supply the wine💕
Made this and it was amazing
Do you taste the zucchini?
Would this recipe work with pork? I don't happen to have any chicken on hand. Wondering if it might be too high in fat content.
Thank you.  Looks great.  I do make several of your dishes and they are all divine.
Made this with the kale tonight - soooo good!
Mmm it looks so deliciousss like everything else you make 😋
Going to try this, bought some buttermilk powder today just for this. That said, with chicken you don't need the indentation like you do for beef, and please use a thermometer to show people you're getting it to a safe eating temperature. That really is a big omission IMO.
I would love to see you on GUYS GROCERY GAME I know you would win for sure. I make a lot of your recipes and they are divine. To me your one of the best cooks in America!!!
Can you please share a French onion pasta recipe? ☺️☺️☺️ Like a pasta dish that tastes like French onion soup? ☺️
Those look amazing!!! Nice way to sneak in some veggies too!!
