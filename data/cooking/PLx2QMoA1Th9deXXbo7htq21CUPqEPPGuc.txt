Thank you for all the comments! If you want to learn more about Mrs Crocombe and her life at Audley End, listen to our new podcast episode with food historian Annie Grey where we discuss Avis Crocombe's life at Audley End https://bit.ly/2VdH3dV
Oh thank goodness. She's back. The only good thing in my life.
You have been blessed with a visit to Mrs. Crocombe kitchen, naturally you'll have to be put to work immediately.
Clicked on this faster than the scullery maid wiping up the counters.
The three dislikes are from Mary-Ann, Sylvia, and Annie Chase for being snubbed from "the more important servants' table"
Mrs Crocrombe is so sweet and patient to the children :) love how they slowly add depths to the series. Now we know how her kitchen works now, as well as the members in the house.
Mrs Crocombe may be strict on her turf, but she knows the curiosity of children is an innocent thing!
This is the most British thing i've seen in a long time, and i wish i could swim in it.
"Are you the only one who works here?"
"The only one who's worth a toss, that's for sure. Though Maryanne is competent enough to chop dried cherries. With supervision, of course."
The more I learn about cooking in Victorian times, the more I appreciate my food processor and my KitchenAid mixer...
4:24 Mrs.C: "I'm gonna make you scrub the kitchen so hard once the camera's off"
"Are you hands clean!?" then I immediately am reminded of the Victorian hygiene I learned from Horrible Histories.
"Oh yes that's perfect" whisks it more Just like my mom when I was little and wanted to help in the kitchen
Watching these videos is my only way to survive the end of Dontown Abbey
The boys are so cute :D
Miss Crocombe mother mode:  activated!!
I’m not buying the sugary sweetness. This must be an impostor. The real Mrs. Crocombe would have swatted those greedy little fingers off her mixing bowl immediately 🤔
2:22 Jack is like "This is boring. I'd rather play in the garden."


4:36 Ollie's giggle is super adorable
This was so fun to see Mrs. Crocombe interact with the kids
It is impossible not wanting to become a historical interpreter every time I see Kathy on action. Her passion is extremely contagious.
I always look forward to seeing Mrs. Crocombe and the shade she throws. I love this series.
We don’t want you to spoil your dinner...  would you like a dinner spoiler!?
Good boys! Thanks for this, English Heritage!
Imagine if one of the helpers was Gordon Ramsay.
Another awesome recipe, thank you! ☺
Those boys are so cute and well mannered 💜💜
What a sweet episode :-) but I'm still waiting for u guys to publish her cookbook
I still remember that one time Mrs. Crocombe put Mary-Ann in her place...
That looked nice very familiar with this style  of kitchen . When a 3 yrs. old .I was sent to stay with an aunt in Wales . From London. Bombs. She had a huge edwardian house but the kitchen was like this . All hand made everything . 2 yrs. I stayed and many memories remain.
Im a simple person.

I see a notification from Mrs Crocombe I click.
The boys are sweet and well mannered. Ms Crocombe is stern but gentle. Very sweet!
The true Queen has graced us with her presence.
is she trying to say schneemilch? as in german snow milk?
I need more of Ms Crocombe!! Been checking for updates every single day and finally she's back!!! 5 minutes well spent!
this episode reminds me Secret Garden or The Railway Children. Lovely work
This video was soothing to my soul and put me in a great mood! E.H., you outdid yourself!!!! Also all Hail Avis <3
What charming boys!  I'm glad they took to helping you so well!
Jack's death stare at Ollie at 2:21
one of my favorite channels on youtube tbh
4:37 what a beautiful boy with a lovely laugh 😊
Please teach us, Mrs. Crocombe.  Let us become one with your goodness, your righteousness, your consummate skill.  Absorb us.  Absorb us!
Clicked faster than Mary Ann's dicing skills
This was so wholesome! The children are so adorable 😊💕
YAAAAAYYY! Hello Mrs Crocombe! OMG Jack and Ollie are so freaking CUTE!
 
  
 
Edited three times!! Why can't I spell her name?! 😭
"Yes please!!" The sound of little boys hopeful to get some sweet treats? ;p
Very sweet. Thank  you for that, as always!
3:57 Mrs Crocombe gives her rarest look of all : approval!
We've found her weakness :  clean and adorable
moppets!
Love all Mrs. Crocombe videos- my absolute favorites! Could you share some recipes of what the servants would have eaten at their meal times? It would be interesting to see the differences in what they are served compared to the meals for the home owners and their guests.
I do love these videos! 
Keep them coming! ❤️🇨🇦❤️
Loved it!!❤️
Mrs. Crocombe is back!
This is adorable.
Is everyone just magically adorable at Audley End?
Oh how I've missed you!  Thank you so much for posting this!  ❤️❤️❤️
Omg! I just realised!
She's making a sweet custard dish for Lord Braybrooke!
And in the episode of March 1st 2019 she's saying how Lord Braybrooke just loves custard and he would eat it with everything!

Thank you so much wonderful people of English Heritage and everyone who works on creating these episodes to pay attention to these little details!

Yours truly, 
a Mrs Crocombe fan from the Netherlands ❤ 

PS. Please make an (at least) 26 episode one hour long series on location of this, with Kathy Hipperson in the role of Mrs Crocombe! 
(and I wouldn't mind seeing more of that cute guy who played John Barker, one of the grooms in the stables of Audley End, either! 😉 (from the episodes of August 23rd and September 5th 2017) )
Schneemilch?  Snow milk in german?
So early!!! Love this series!!!
Oh my this is adorable
Cheeky wench has one of her buttons undone. smh.
Mrs Crocombe is wonderful. Greeting from Peru
Yaayyy!!! Mrs. Crocombe is back!
I love your videos Mrs Crocombe!! I enjoy all the information of how was the life in that time. Thanks! Kisses from Argentina!
1. Mrs. Crocome
2. Trixie Mattel
3. Katya

The only three YouTube personalites I will stop what I am doing to watch them, not in any particular order
That was so adorable!
Mrs. Crocombe always improves the quality of my day.
"the more important servants"  daaaaamn.
"are there any children at Audley End House?" "not since I"ve been here. "  
and the sass coming from those boys...haha I'm dying!  This is pure comedy!
Really enjoy this episode ❤❤😋 they are adorable and making the episode more lively
@2:21 hes looking around like "is something supposed to be happening to this milk!?" 😂

These boys are so sweet 🥰
After watching the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Part 2 I would be very, very wary of eating any almond-flavoured cookies made by kind-looking middle aged ladies lmao
This
This is too blessed
No matter what kind of day I'm having, Mrs. Comcombe always manages to make me smile with one of her great videos. Keep up the good work! 😃
"The more important servants" HMMMM 
Some things don't change, huh.

I love this series so much!
And a lovely visit it was! Thank you for another glimpse of Mrs. Crocombe and life ay Audley End.
OMG they look so adorable on their little victorian outfits!
This interaction was adorable. Love all the videos of Mrs Crocombe!
Another fun Video from Mrs. Crocombe!
What a perfect video ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ it's so good to have this kind of production on YouTube ♡♡♡♡congratulations for the exceptional work ♡♡♡
This is the cuuutest thing ever!!
Never felt so bad by being late in watching this video.
I'm going to need a weekly tv  series of hour long productions...….I can't get enough!  I simply melt into her world and it's oddly comforting.
I want to meet this Lord she’s so fond about

4:37 his laugh made me choke
I hit the like button so hard!
GASP ...NOW NOW!!! We don’t want you spoiling your dinner, tsk!...😂😂

Love this woman. 💖
Odds of Mrs. C. actually serving this in the nursery?
I ABSOLUTELY love these series🥰
💟 she's back💟
These videos are my favourite. I love Mrs. Crocombe so much. ❤️❤️❤️
this was so sweet!!! :D thanks english heritage!!
Oh my goodness. You should for real make an entire movie or series with alot of actors about the life there. Such a lovely clip <3
Yay Mrs. C! So fun! Thanks EH💕😂🤘🇬🇧
Mrs. Crocombe can smack my hand any day.
This snobby higharchy is reminiscent of Captain Peacock on Are You Being Served. Lol
this series is so lovely 😍
Never showed up on notifications ☹️
I love Mrs Crocombe =D
Schneemilch = Snowmilk... I am confused.
So... what kind of custard, how do I get it to set as firm as that? 
Sigh.
I need the recipe ;)
Once you've finished in the kitchen, lads, it's up the chimneys for you - they need a good sweep! Oh no, looks like you're too old...
These are always beautifully produced - well done EH, Mrs Crocombe, Jack and Ollie! Always a joy to watch!
Ms.Crocome needs a break though.
I didn't know Mrs.Crocombe supports child labor 😂
Such well behaved little boys, and a great help.  I love Mrs. Crocombe, is is amazing!
This is very sweet and cute,such lovely video❤
Very cute! Loved this. I'd love to hear more from the gardeners
When is Mrs Crocombe getting a show on Netflix?
We all know that Master Jack did not whip that cream to stiff peaks. 😂
I always feel less stressed after watching your videos lol
More like these! 👍👍
i love this channel so much! my grandmother and i are gonna try some of Mrs crocombe' recipes this summer cause i got her hooked too
OMG I didn't expect that and it's awesome!!
She is the best, I adore Mrs. Crocombe and she is very patient with the children. This is wholesome, we need more :c ♡
...i wish to be those children ^-^ they have been blessed with such opportunity to meet her ♡
This is such a satisfying series and channel! Fantastic. (These bright-eyed boys are just adorable and their eyes on Mrs. Crocombe are totally and completely awwww-worthy)
Simply darling! <3
Love all these in the series but this is my favorite so far!
I was giggling the whole time! And the dish looks good too!
This is so precious!
America doesn’t have well mannered children like that. 🥳
Master Ollie and Master Jack, It has been a pleasure to meet you! Thank you for finding out about the kitchens for us!
Hahaha this is by far one of my favorite episodes! The boys are very amusing ❤️❤️
I was supposed to sleep, but this takes priority!
tbh i wished schools had field trips to teach you history.  and showing you how it was like beside a book.
Im hungry right nowwww ohh im eating >_<
Such well mannered boys ☺️
4:17 the crunch sounds effect ahahahahaha😂
It reminds me of Downton Abbey when I hear the words Butler, Footman, Kitchen maid, Lord and Lady..😄😄 Does this happen to anybody else?☺☺
Loved it ! Like always!
I see Mrs. C and I immediately click!
This is just so cute! I love how Mrs Crocombe is so welcoming to the kids, even if she does have to scold them once in a while. It really helps to get answers to a lot of our questions without needing a formal interview or break of character. Great job!
I don't really know why I didn't subscribe sooner?  I really enjoy these videos.  It's nice to see she has upgraded from a wooden whisk to a wire one.😉  Modern times.
I double clutched when that boy stuck his finger in the cream. Usually Mrs C drags peasants for acting uncivilized.
They caught her on a good day :-)
Such a REFINED dessert!
Sees the kids with Mrs. Crocombe
MY HEART!!
She is so Dickensian.
I love this video!  And these two sweet boys are precious.
OH !!! How Absolutely Charming .. I would Love to See History Come To life Like this!!   It is Such a charming way to serve a glimpse of yesteryear <3
I get so excited when I see a new Mrs. Crocombe video!!!
pure class
How cute are those boys! Very enjoyable video as always!
This is adorable! And our queen of the kitchen continues her glorious reign!
But where is the recipe???
Lucky kiddos!! This is so precious, I love this!
Well, that was adorable.
“The more important servants”lol
This is just precious. Reminds me of when my nephew was younger and helped me with making sweets. I'm gonna cry.
Yay! She's back! Pay her EVERYTHING!!!
Schneemilch="Snow-milk" in German.
I love this <3 She's amazing
We would love to see some more of such coming... Lovely. ♥
Ollie is so adorable 😻 4:36 to bright up your day
This is the most entertaining channel on all of YouTube and you guys deserve a lot more views. ☕🍴
Watching this makes me feel like that era is the best era to live in
Always a charming and informative show
You nod like you'll never nod again Olly!
How is this always so calming and just awesome!?! This should be a weekly show about life and times of mrs. Crocombe!
OUR SNATCHED QUEEN IS BACK
This is so sweet!!  I love these videos :)  it's so much fun to step back in time :)
Mrs Crocombe looks absolutely fabulous in her new dress!
As if the world has entered into a fairy tale😍😍😍😋😊😊😍😍😍😍😍😍
Never clicked on a video faster
When i m bored i watch this to see how boring life can be! And i m no more bored. 😂
OI M8 U GOT A LOICENS FOH DOS CHILDREN 'DERE?!
I click on your vids the fastest of any!
Love the intro with the cute little boys!
I think the dessert is called Schneemilch.
They are so adoriable
The question we should be asking is how do you even spell that dish. I can even pronounce it !
The children asked all the right questions!
My God...I'm in Heaven!!
My boys enjoyed seeing Jack and Ollie in the kitchen!
I loved this so much!
Mrs Crocombe needs to have a TV series
This is very wholesome! More please :)
I love her!  Great story teller!  I feel like I am right there with her.
Unbearably delightful. And still...
Omg this was everything!! 😍😍😍😍😍
She’s only so nice to them because they’re both young masters of the house and not a orphaned lad down the street. 😜
Love love love you Mrs. Crocombe.
Mrs. Crocombe's back, great!!!
Why is this the cutest video ever! So adorable!
Is there some way to make the end cards pop up on the black screen, instead of on top of Mrs. Crocombe? Thank you.
In which we discover that the stern Mrs. Crocombe has a total soft spot for children.
4:08 sounds like she's gonna poison them
Lovely! But young lads like that should know to take off their caps when they go inside. Mrs. Crocombe was very kind.
I can't say how delighted I am to see Ms. Crocombe back in the kitchen.
The footman...Evelyn Hardcastle would be most distressed.
"Ok kids.....Breaks over....Back to the coal mines with you."
I love these videos. The English heritage is fascinating to me especially since it's the foundation on which my country was based on. Greetings from Washington D.C. USA
Oh my goodness I love this!
I do love my Mrs. Crocombe fix!
A priceless representation of Victorian life.
They're so lucky. I wanna have an opportunity to meet her.
Aw, this is so cute. What nice little boys. I adore boys with English accents.
I could watch these for hours!!
That was too precious , awesome video !
Classic is amazing
What a lovely visit into the Kitchens of  Audley End House. As Mrs. Crocombe, still ever efficient, gives time to two curious young men, we once more are impressed with her capable running of the kitchen even with visitors. The young men asked some very interesting questions and were quite helpful. No idle hands in Mrs. Crocombe's domain.
I truly look forward to all your Audley End House videos, and most especially Mrs. Crocombe. Could we have more, please? I would like to know if Lady Braybrook ever has planning sessions with Mrs. Crocombe when special guests come to stay? If they do could we please see how one might be, I am interested in how the interaction would go.
Just when I thought I couldn’t like these videos more, this explosion of cuteness shows up. Those little boys and her interaction with them was so precious!
I would love to be a fly on the wall back in those times listening to the other staff bad mouthing, you know the British wit back then was hilarious 😂
Why do I feel like I've seen this before?
What a cute boys!
Every day with Mrs. Crocombe is a GREAT day! Kathy Hipperson is so wonderful in her character re-enactments.
Daaaang Mrs. Crocombe got co-stars now
Beautiful video, very lovely
Greetings from Mexico 💖🇲🇽
I want a mother like Mrs Crocombe pleasee
Delightful as always 😊😊😊
4:37 cuteee
Omg this was fun! Those kids were so cute!
I seriously love this.
Hip hip hooray for Mrs crocombe boys in this time certainly would not of dared to try take a finger full of any food  cheeky little things
I love how this is presented. I learn so much from these videos!
Just one problem.......too short!  😊
I'm so glad there's a new episode. I love learning about Victorian food.
Schneemilch: snow-milk
This makes my heart warm.
Never hit a video to play quicker than when I see she’s back again
日本語字幕版が欲しい
This reminds me of the famous five book
I love this lady  she really makes history come alive.
I just need a weekly dose of Crocumbe!
So cute!
I really love this channel!
I’m American but I love these videos
I like your idea 💡 😍

Work small children, WORK
2:01 u ok there Ollie?
The way that kid is looking at his brother at 2:23 😂😂😂😂
ok, that was cute!
WHO ARE THE FEW MISERABLE GITS TO DISLIKE THIS VIDEO ???
I didn't catch the name of the dish... anyone??
Excellent!
I wish I had a British accent :/
Showed this to my 7-year-old and she adored it. Now she won't stop with the, "I wish I lived back then!" I'm going to let her imagine and enjoy for now, don't need to spoil it for her. Besides, it's cute!
I guess I have probably been english,  in another life ! 😁
We all know why we clicked the video and it wasn't for the title or the two little boys.
From the Era of children were seen but not heard. What a pain as a kid.
I just love this episode. It’s so lovely.
Reminds me of Trifle
My lot were in the workhouse 😂
awesome.......I wish I was in this era
Absolutely adorable
Ollie and Jack are waaay too posh to ever be let in the kitchen. Although they wouldn't care either.
Loved it!
Those costumes will earn them a good thrashing from their school mates.
More episodes with these two lovely boys please!
I have a friend named Augusta that is wild she's going to adore that
Those two boys were delightful.
What happened to the volume?
Delightful 💕
Never felt so bad by being late in watching this video.
I love this!!!!
N i c e
Imagine you are one of these boys and your parents are Lord and Lady Braybrooke. It is May 1881 and you wake up in your room at Audley End to the golden stream of sunshine beaming out of your window. You hear the hustle and bustle in the hallways and you suddenly remember that today, your father is returning from his business trip in India. You quickly run to the window and see the sky is already sunny with faint hints of orange, blue and white and there is some light morning fog still disappearing in the distance. You run out of your room into the halls and you see the cooks and maids and cleaners and servants all running around cleaning and cooking and carrying all sorts of vegetables, fruits, and prepared dishes. You rush to your mom's room and tell her you're excited to see your father and she tells the maid to quickly dress you up for his arrival. You are dressed and you hear your father has come, you run out of the back door from excitement and you see the green grass of Audley End and gardens and the bright glow of the sun. It is a beautiful day and your fathers carriage has arrived, along with several others. You rush to him, your feet stamping hard on the green grass and you embrace him in a hug. You tell him to tell you all the stories of India and he hugs you and gives you a big kiss with a smile. You and your parents eat a lovely meal of turbot right after and your father shows you the exotic gifts he brought from India, one of them being a coconut in which you are deeply fascinated by. Your mom tells you that you have to take an afternoon nap because there is a grand ball in the evening because of your father's return. You head over to your room but you make a quick stop in the kitchen. Mrs Crocombe is making a mince pie for the ball and you ask her if you can try any. She gives you a raised eyebrow, smirks, and lets you have some candied lemon peel. You thank her and she tells you to go on your way. You go to your room, change, and your mom and dad arrive to tuck you in and give you a small kiss. You tell them you're excited for the ball in the evening and you close your eyes and slowly fall into a dreamy sleep.
Augustar??!! 🤣🤣🤣
Get those street urchins up the chimneys or else its pandybat time!
Too adorable.
😊👍
I lovveeeee this so much
Loved it !
Those boys look so cute! Like they are really from that time!
Adorable ❤️♥️
🥺❤️
I love learning!
I like that it’s boys that are seeing how the kitchen works!
Very nice 👌🏻😍♥️
Yaaaaaaay
1:59🙂

2:00☺️
This is so cute
4:35
This is better than townsend
I wanna enroll to her 😁😁
Those kids were too cute
Such a nice episode
That was adorable!
Wish we could do like a competition putting a Victorian age Chef in a modern kitchen and a modern chef in a Victorian kitchen and Duke it out.
So polite
That was adorable.  Wish my kids were that proper.
Adorable!!!!!
Ollie have a cute giggle
Really weird lol
What delightful lads!
That was cute
That was cute
So adorable!
Delightful 😊
<3
Adorable. :)
Will somebody transmogrify the Victorian incarnation of these boys over to my house? Please!
I love these videos, I’ve been watching them for years, plus the fan base isn’t so toxic. I’m happy now to be part of the fans who constantly have to be up to date with these videos
Good so much
That custard looks like sliced Velveeta. I don't think it's going to melt into the dessert.
ahhh i wanna meet mrs crocombe too
When you know the names of most of the servants Mrs. Crocombe mentioned hahaha XD
Just a idea , Lady Braybrooke could come into the kitchen to give her orders about a special dinner party , I would love to see the Lady and the Queen of the kitchen interacting together
What well mannered boys these are! Are English children this well mannered still today or?
Looks super yummy 😋 🤤
What a lovely episode
Who is Meet Victorian and why is she cooking Mrs Crocombe?
Will Avis show us how to make this Dish
What cute and well mannered little gentlemen
It is not lost on me that they made Ollie the scamp. GOT ref?
Such adorable kids!
oh my how precious is this with the kids....overall all another just perfect video! Just one of my favorite Shows. She sounds so elegant not like me all bubbly in my cooking/baking videos lol. But can someone tell me was it common to call Kids master as well, even if they not from the same House?
i’m so addicted to these videos
I love that little egg caddy.
Nice video
Wouldn't mind being a rich Victorian,  but would hate to be the average person.
This is a great birthday present! Thanks for the new video 😊
Did Mrs. C get a new dress?
Love.
The boys are adoraaaable tho
Ollie's nod at 2:01
Too cute!
Of course custard
Has any one tried her queen drop biscutes?
BIG UWU
Cute
So cute.
So cute!
Isn't the German Schneemilch made with diced bread instead of custard? Took me a while though to understand her pronounciation.
Doesn't want appetite spoiled for dinner. Proceeds to give cookies instead.
Hi, wouldn't the pistachios, historically, been red?  I remember hearing that until the 1970's they has a red dye in them, cant remember if it was to preserve or mislead though
This reminds me of a comment someone left on a Mrs. Crocombe video before; they said they watch her videos and pretend to be the stable boy that Mrs. Crocombe had taken a liking too, listening to her stories as she feeds him yesterday's old biscuits because she thinks he's too skinny.
So much fun to watch.
Luckiest kids EVER!!!!!!!
When she mentioned servants not eating the same food as the Braybrookes 😕
ok but....how do you spell the name of the dish??
Mrs. Crocombe. I am a fan. ;-)
Very cute 😊
So cute! Wish kids of today could be like this.
I wish life was still like this except for the hygiene part and the medical part. Other than that ,  I love it
Does schneemilch means snow milk? And was German cooking popular back in the Victorian days?
The boy called Jack is in my class
I wish little boys still dressed like that. (sigh)
Those 2 boys need a good canning,on the bare..!
You think there's still places in the UK that act like this n have the Victoria mind set ? Lmfao
Let's be real. The acting is a bit awkward. That's what makes it more comic and enjoyable.
Change the music back to the old stuff
As always, thank you for watching! We’ve answered some of your FAQs below:

WHY IS MRS CROCOMBE USING HER HANDS TO COMBINE THE MIXTURE INSTEAD OF A SPOON? ISN’T THAT UNHYGIENIC?
Assuming they have been thoroughly washed first, mixing by hand is perfectly fine. The Victorians were well aware of food hygiene, even if they hadn't entirely realised what germs were. In fact, many books of the time recommend mixing with your hand as it's easier and quicker than mixing with a spoon.

IS MRS CROCOMBE WEARING A NEW DRESS?
Yes, well spotted! Servants were often given bolts of cloth as presents from their employers on Boxing Day, and then made their own dresses (full disclosure: Kathy did not make hers – we use a specialist costumier!). Sometimes each department (kitchen, laundry, dairy, etc) had specifically coloured gowns so that the housekeeper could tell at a glance if someone was where they should not be. By the 1880s, the housemaids who had regular contact with the family and their visitors usually wore uniforms, but often the back of house staff did not. (Find out more about what the real Mrs Crocombe wore in our behind-the-scenes video:  

CAN I USE MOLASSES INSTEAD OF TREACLE? DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS?
In the UK you can buy dark treacle. Elsewhere, liquid molasses works, though blackstrap is the closest substitute. You can also use a lighter treacle or syrup but the result won’t be as delicious.

WHY DID MRS CROCOMBE TASTE THE GINGERBREAD BUT NOT THE OTHER RECIPES?
Most of the recipes Mrs Crocombe cooks in these videos are for the family, and as a general rule small missing chunks would not exactly further her employment prospects. She generally knows what her recipes taste like (and, in 2019, we cook them regularly as part of the live interpretation in the kitchens) meaning tasting isn’t usually required. However, dishes also needed to be presentable, occasionally leaving small off-cuts that wouldn’t just be left to go to waste.
So nobody’s gonna talk about how Mrs. Crocombe is rocking that new dress?! 👀🥰
I see Mrs.CROCOMBE in the thumbnail I click it asap😍!!!
I love love love the small comments inbetween on the society. West/East Indies, the reduxed taxes thing. It adds so much to the immersion and zeitgeist 😍
"Eggs from home, sugar from the West Indies, and spice from the East Indies." Meanwhile my eggs came from Dollar Tree, sugar from Walmart, and spice from Save-A-Lot...


 I'm just a peasant...
To the ten people who disliked this video....

Your mother is a hamster and your father smells of elderberries!
These videos are so wonderfully relaxing. Thank you for these little nuggets of happiness, English Heritage!
This minute I saw the notification I rushed to watch this.  I would love to see an entire series about Mrs Crocombe.  Her entire "life", day, everything.
i double checked that treacle is essentially molasses. yes, it is.
my mind says ginger cake mix but my heart says mud cakes I made outside when I was 7
Drops everything The notification’s quite on time again 😊
3-4 lbs of butter *a day*? Wow. And I need to know what the lower servants eat. :-D
Its Saint Hilda... I mean Mrs crocombe!
I love the little details about the house, the tax reduction etc, makes it feel so much more real!
Me: Hmm, maybe it's time to get off Youtube and have a nap. 

Also me: sees Mrs Crocombe and immediately opens video
It's almost exactly my grandmoms soft gingerbread cake ! Called "mjuk pepparkaka" in Swedish, where we are from. It's also my favorite cake ever 😁
My name is Carolina and i'm a Crocombeholic.
Dang! Only the Top Servants get Ginger Cake?!? The shade continues . .. Lol!
The poor lower servants, seeing that plate on the high table and not getting even a crumb.
I'll take watching Mrs. Crocombe over any fancy modern cooking show.
I loved all the extra little tidbit of information - besides the cake sounds really delicious :)
Oh yeah! Add a dollop of clotted cream Mrs. C and I'll see you at the table! Thankyou and everyone have a lovely Easter!🇬🇧🐇🐥😘💐🇺🇸
i’m a simple girl. I see Mrs Crocombe, I click. Always loving the videos!
Yayyy! Thank you English Heritage! 
Please, please don't make us wait long for the next one, I still want to know what happened to the second gardener you know.
When I hear her say those glorious words “for this recipe, you will need...” I get excited to be transported back to Victorian England
Mrs. Crocombe's got a new dress!
Mrs. Crocombe!  Is that a new dress I spy? What a lovely tricot.
Omg, she's got on a new dress! Lovely colour!
Mrs. Crocombe? Dropped everything!
Stop the presses! Stop everything! Mrs. Crocombe is back with another relaxing recipe!
I love these videos and I'm always wanting more... What were the Lord and Lady like? How did the menu planning go? I need at least an hour long video!
Mrs. Crocombe got a new 'fit yall!
Almost threw down my phone clicking on the thumbnail ❤️
Mrs Crocombe snatched my wig
I love this series!! The women/men portrayed in this worked their arse's off to keep "upper crust" folks clean fed!!
This episode was awesome. Love how they told where the spices are from and included history about the taxes...
I am just going to know this was released Just because I was thinking how much I needed a new video, and not 10 mins later here it is.. I am so glad you are seeing to my desires in such a timely manner... LOL
I'm in the middle of making bread and stopped to watch this!
I love these videos =D I hope to have the time and space to recreate some of your recipes someday!
Thank you all for your hard work!
Fantastic show. All that vintage cookware has me aghast, quite a fantastic collection indeed. Keep up the good work, we really enjoy it. cheers.
Chef John and Mrs. Crocombe uploading on the same day! Heaven!!!
Any video from English Heritage is a joy to see, but one with cooking and Mrs. Crocombe is even more so.  <3
Is that a new dress, Mrs. Crocombe?
I love Mrs crocombe but why is she mixing a cake with her hands? Especially when a wooden spoon is next to her
Thank you for genuinely making my day again ♥️♥️ have a happy Easter!!!!!!!! And I love you're new outfit lol!!
Mrs. Crocombre is THE BEST!
These videos bring so much happiness. They’re so pleasant ❤️
I love warm gingerbread cake with vanilla ice cream. 😊
FOR ALL THE AMERICANS:

Black Treacle = Blackstrap Molasses (Regular Molasses will work)

Bicarbonate of Soda = Baking Soda
Too bad the sugar tax is back!
Every time this notification pops up my day gets 10 times better
Ahhhh finally! Mrs. Crocombe has a different OOTD😂
Such beatiful new dress! Congratulation! I love this channel so much! Lots of love and hugs from Norway.
3-4 pounds of butter a day?! I’m not sure whether to be scared or delighted by that...
Never have I ever clicked on a video notification so fast 😍😍😍😍
HELLO MRS. CROCOMBE!!!! WELCOME BACK! 💕💕💕
Gingerbread was always a favorite growing up. Now my grandniece asks for it and gingerbread cookies often.
I love Mrs crocombe. I can't click fast enough
1:36 Paula Deen approves
I don't even like gingerbread. I came for the Crocombe. #Hawt
I always look forward to these videos! they make my day and i just keep rewatching until the next ones comes out! will definitely be trying this recipe when the holidays come!! 😊
Gingerbread cake is extra yummy with lemon curd
I will drop everything to watch Mrs. Crocombe!
Omg... did you see the garden in the outtro.. So full of Spring! I hope it was a view of real time. 
Happy Easter to everyone! 😊
Am I suppose to enjoy these as much as I do??!!!! So bleepen peaceful! ❤️❤️❤️
Dear Mrs. Crocombe, congratulations with a new dress! It is divine! You are a vision of loveliness!
I swear these vids are excuses for me to fatten myself up nice and  plump for the Australian winter.
God I absolutely LOVE this lady!! I look forward to Mrs. Crocombe and her recipes!!
If my oven was working properly today, I’d make this in a heartbeat! 
So delicious and such a beautiful recipe. 👍👍🌸🌸🍰🍰
Now we need to see Ms. Warricks goings on in the dairy!!!❤🤗
Her cooking videos make my day! ♥️
I’ve stopped practicing my dancing for this!!! I love these videos😆
The Mother is back! Gurl! Yasss! z-snap
This series is one if the few genuinely decent shows.
Oh, hello Mrs. Crocombe, queen of baking YouTube
gets a notification for a new video. Drops everything to watch
I always have time to watch anything with the Queen of England
Yay!! I haven’t had a good day. This helped.

Edit: she reminds me of my mom so much. I genuinely cherish these videos.
LOL Mrs Crocombe yes I display my brownies like that too! So nobody knows theres a piece missing 😉😎😏🤣
Always a delight when Mrs. Crocombe makes one of her recipes.
It's like gingerbread brownies.
Anew dress would be nice for Mrs .Crocombe
Hmm.. delicious.  These Mrs Crocombe vids give me life.😊
I bet, Lord&Lady Breibruke could never guess, that 150 years ago, when they will be long gone&forgotten, their humble servant Mrs. Crocombe will become a real Queen of Youtube, with half a million people looking at her "reincarnation" with admiration and a deep respect!
Mrs. Crocombe, I have missed your acquaintance.  How lovely to see you again and your marvelously delicate cooking ♡
Mrs. Crocombe, it’s nice to see you again. ❤️
Oooo ‘top servants table’ what a flex Mrs Crocombe!
a new vid!!! 😍💗
*sees thumbnail...hard press on screen xD

Ah~ another delightful recipe ^-^ ♡
I absolutely love her videos.  And historical information dispensed so casually, "this would be great for servants or a family".  Thank you again!
It is always so delightful to see mrs crocombe cooking
I wonder if there was ever a time where Ms. Crocombe thought: 
"If Lord and Lady BrayBrooke do not fancy this meal, they can most certainly, catch these hands" 🤔
Does Mrs Crocombe got a new dress? Very pretty :)
Amazing!! I love this videos!! 👏
I'm so sad to say this: But this was the worst cake ever. I tried it out yesterday after looking for the treacle since the video came out (it was not easy to find it in austria) and I was so excited because I need a few cakes for a historical picnic in may..but well...the smell and taste was not good at all. 
But I don't really mind. The other recipes I tried from this series were SO delicious and I'm going to try out future recipes too! :D
The music makes me so sentimental for Mrs. Crocombe <3
I think i watched every recipe because of this great lady, but I must say I am still not convinced about the greateness of english gastronomy 🤔
St.Hilda, granter of prayers.
You've no clue how badly I want to visit that big old mansion in the intro.  ❤️
Finally!! I've missed Mrs. Crocombe so much ☺️
I love you Mrs. Crocombe.  This looks fabulous 💓💓💓
English Heritage: "We need more views..... call in Mrs. Crocombe!" 
PS. Mrs. Crocombe is the best.
"For this recipe, you will need" is so satisfying to hear 😍😍
Please make clotted cream for us, Mrs. Crocombe!
And happy (belated) Easter to everyone at Audley End House 🙂
Thank you for these videos. I adore them and I learn something each time I watch one.
2:13 me when I try to be more intresting and multicultural
I'm so going to bake this. Thank you Mrs. Crocombe!
Does anyone ever comment on these about something other than how fast they clicked the video? Lol
That dough certainly is no beauty :-) I would use a wooden spoon in stead of my hands. A small piece of cake  with some butter and a cup of tea - and I'll be fine.
arrange cake
have an extra piece
nah, eat it anyway
Honestly I love her so much 🤣
Its just feel so good to see another culture from another country😍😍
Love from Indonesia 😍
Love the new attire of Mrs. Crocombe! :3
I had to drop everything.Mrs C is back.🍴🍵
I always make time for a new Mrs. Crocombe video!
I swear, the other day I was reading a recipe, it started by "for this recipe, you will need", I heard Mrs Crocombe in my head, and I felt like the whole thing was victorian way, when it was actually cinnamon rolls...
I absolutely need to try this gingerbread recipe ! The one I have doesn't have any treacle in it !
I literally just made Gingerbread cake. lol.
Hi! The gingerbread looks yummy. Nice seeing you again. 😊
YES YES YES I AM ADDICTED TO THESE!!!!
Three to four pounds of butter a day!!! 🤯😁❤️
Legendas em português por favor.
I'm so happy our thicc and SHADY Queen gave herself a treat, well deserved decadence for this fearless icon!!
Oooh posted yesterday! Yay! Total pleasure watching these vids😊 More! More! Thanks so much from New Zealand, a lot of work must go into them. Appreciated.
Sadly, 02:51 cannot be unseen.
Simply DELICIOUS!!
Oooh, liked the little detail about household butter consumption.
Giving us all the ASMR from the hand mixing.
I love you, Mrs.Crocombe from THAILAND ❤️
All hail The great and marvelous Mrs Crocombe 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
6:12
My reaction when I eat candy after a long time! 😂
Treacle... hmmm... 
do you happen to know anything about what Billie Eilish drank in When the Party’s Over?
هل من عرب؟
My Lord ASMR
I love that part 😍
YES! Love the gingerbread cake! Some of my favorite flavors. Thank you for giving us another Mrs. Crocombe episode!!
I love everything Mrs Crocombe! I had to stop everything and watch.
Long time no see. 
Hey there! 😁😁
Welcome back, Mrs. Crocumbe!  I love your new dress, and that cake looks awesome!  Also, do you guys have a new director?  The pacing seems much slower in this video, and Mrs. Crocumbe didn't throw any shade.

Update: Nevermind on the shade, I see what she did there with that bit about the top servants' table.  ;)
That's a new one: mixing cake batter with your hands?! Lol, lovely recipe though.
Love the new dress!  <3
Wasn't the cost of ginger and other spices like a year's servant's salary? 💜🌞🌵
Watching her work in that lovely kitchen just comforts me.
I love watching european cooking show.
For instance, from the west europe, i like watching Ms. Crocombe's Victorian Way. 
And from the east europe, i like watching Cooking with Boris.
Thank God, I was going into withdrawal.
Always loving these videos with Mrs. Crocombe! ❤ So relaxing and enjoyable!
Finally mrs crocombe! I was wondering what to serve for the landlord's dinner.
Never clicked so fast in my life
I'm a sucker for dessert items so this particular upload made me feel an extreme mouthwatering hunger
The BBC need to team up with these lot and make period drama/cooking show
I love the idea of an immortal/time travelling St Hilda who travels through the ages fighting snakes and demons in one era and making gâteau des pommes in another
What a pleasure this channel is. There's nothing else like it on youtube. I would love to see a roast goose recipe
This lady and the whole English Heritage series make me so happy!
I love how much shade Mrs. Crocombe throws at people! 😂
Man I love this series!
And watched by many people in different countries. What an international cake, indeed!
Love Mrs. Crocombre. :D maybe I'll try this recipe someday.
Beautiful new dress Mrs. Crocombe ... 😊👌
Seriously, every time I see a new Mrs. Crocombe video, I freak out with joy and watch it immediately.
My god! Those air pockets 😍 Reminded me of the honeycomb or hokey pokey
MUITO BOM!!
These videos are super relaxing. I really enjoy them.
Me encantan sus recetas!! No sé que es la Melasa?....saludos desde Chile.
Glad to see Mrs. Crocombe in such a good mood! 😁
(Unrelated) But everytime someone comments about Mrs. Crocombe, I keep misreading it as Mrs. Cucumber ;-;
I think this channel & Mrs crocombe are my faves here on YouTube 😍. Sure trying this recipe... what is that under the bowl that hods it like that, anybody know???
I could just imagine bardroy from black butler hosting a show like this lmao
What a wonderful video! Always a pleasure to see Mrs. Crocombe! ☺ And the cake looks delicious! 😀
I just broke my trackpad from clicking so hard on this video when I saw Mrs. Crocombe
I would love to visit this place one day and have a good meal with Mrs.Crocombe❤
I droped the baby when I saw the notification!
Mrs. Crocombe serves the way I do. Oh, the last one won’t fit. It’s mine!
I love you, Mrs. Crocombe ❤
That looks delicious,  Mrs. Crocombe.
How did Mrs. Crocombe know I like cooking with ginger?! YEEES!

Also, this recipe is extremely traditional. Modern day gingerbread recipes that I use have so much more ingredients, I'm assuming this is because of the wide availability and affordability of ingredients compared to the Victorian times.
Her voice is so soft. Aghhh I love Mrs Crocombe <3
I call it Parkin. My great-grandmother would make this when my brother's and I came to see her in Lancashire. Delicious flavour! I'm so glad I have a recipe that could be the closest to how she made it!
Perfect start to Friday 😍😘!
Mrs. Crocombe!!!!!!! As soon as I see her, I click!
A new Mrs. Crocombe video- and an outfit change!
"My new dress ? Oh honey it's called fashion, look it up"
If you don't get addicted to victorian recipes, you shurely get addicted to Mrs. Crocombe!!
Mrs Crocombe videos always brighten my day.  I can't believe how excited I get when there's a new one!
Anybody know where I can download the bg music for this series? Gonna make it my ringtone 😂
UGH! I love this series so much!
I love the new dress! That colour suits her so much <3
Loved the video! But I am not sure about how  stretched it is for example when mrs crocombe is  mixing or pouring. Continuously repeating angle from above on their nose with glasses is overused, in my opinion. Bring back the old operator 😂But I loved the small details and news she is sharing with us! That’s a very good idea.
Hooray!!! 💕💕
Welcome back . I missed you.
I love Mrs. Crocombe <3<3<3
Nice new dress St. Hilda.....I mean Mrs. Crocombe :)
The nose close-ups were a tad much.
Mrs crocombes new gown is beautiful!
Apple butter on top of this would make my day!
4:58  Ahhh so satisfying!
5:08 o
I never clicked so hard before in my entire muggle life!!!!!!!!!!! COME THRU MRS. CROCOMBE
This video made my day!!!❤️I am definitely making this cake!!
It certainly looked delicious!  Sigh!  I am sure that no cake made by our beloved Mrs Crocumbe would ever dare to stick, even if she didn't line the tin!  Thank you for the video.  I hope you can do more of these.  There is no such thing as too much Mrs Crocombe!
that mixture looks... quite ghastly
For anyone who's n not aware what treacle is, it's basically molasses.  It might be a bit darker, I can't recall.
I’m glad to see you finally tasting your recipes! I think we would all love it if you were to describe the taste!
3-4 lbs of butter a day?!?! And waist still snatched?! 😮 💕
Always waiting Mrs Crocombe cooking ❤❤❤❤❤❤
It’s rather delightful to watch your videos,Mrs. Crocombe! This cake looks delicious! 😄
Mrs. Crocombe got a new dress! Very pretty.
what about the lower servants table? let's give them burgoo with a splash of whiskey.
Simply one of the most beautiful productions on YouTube!!!
We stan Mrs. Crocombe!
I'm going to make a cake tonight with only my hands as she does at @4:32
I am from The US. What is Treaco? It looked like Black Strap or less processed Molasses. 😊?🤔
Love the new dress😊😊
Just love these video's......great social history.
My phone pinged and I saw the notification I left my husband with the baby in the other room so I can watch this
I'm thinking these cooks had some wicked upper body strength do all this baking without electric tools.
How to make Saint Hilda Crocombe's gingerbread cake
for the top servants only... how rude.
Do you say almonds?!




No. 😭
This channel is better than any ASMR.
I just went and bought a kitchen scale so I can start making this.
I love your new dress, Mrs. Crocombe!
Lol we all know that Mrs. Crocombe knows how to plan a stack... she definitely "miscounted" on purpose XD;;; Mrs. Crocombe is all of us <3
That stomach growl around 4:40 caught me off guard
I could not click on this fast enough.  Gingerbread cake is one of my favorite things ever.
Do you use a food stylist? 
I ask because the cuts on the finished gingerbread cake squares are very professional-looking and sharp. The only way I know to get that result is by chilling the cake till it’s nearly frozen and cutting it. 

Thank you for all the work that goes into these superb and charming videos. They are among my all-time favorites! Well done!
I've never clicked on a thumbnail so fast before! #CRAZY4CROCOMBE
1 sec in the mouth:

Uhmmm delicious
Can we meet the Braybrooks sometime?
I love eating peperkoek (Dutch gingerbread cake) and Id love to try this victorian recipe 😍 looks delicious
Mrs Crocombe is on,...comes running! I love this so much.
She is so cool and lovely. Such interesting and calming videos. Thank you! :)
Did mrs crocombe get a new dress or am I losing my mind?
Gingerbread Cake is a fav of my children. My recipe is nearly the same
She needs to do full cooking episodes! I could watch her for hours! It's like history cooking to
Oh this reminds me of my great-grandmother’s gingerbread recipe. So delicious!
Notification comes on clicks on it like a ninja
Welcome back Mrs. Crocombe!
I'm mexican, so every time i try to create one of this recipes, an unusual ingredient (for us) comes out.  Some of those did not even know they existed.
So much work! Just Postmates it from Dean & Deluca. Yeesh.
I'm happy that Avis gets to enjoy variety in frocks, but i like the other one better :D thanks e.h. for feeding the Cult of Avis another brilliant video!!! Love this channel
In Poland gingerbread is made with honey 😊
Lovely to see Mrs. Crocombe in her kitchen! Enjoyable video as always!
GOOD LORD... I LOVE THIS LADY
I'm going to get those ingredients and make that cake. It looks so good!
do they have soda bicarbonate during the old day???
It feels like I'm back in this time, when I wasn't even born
I always like the opening music. Does anyone know what is the name of it?
I did not know you could use a lighter syrup, i wonder if i would like this more with something less dark.
AHAHAHAH That cut at the end of the last pour. Probably made a scullery maid hold up that awkward heavy bowl.
yay a new vid!! love these!!
Always a pleasure to hear from the Queen.
Mrs Crocombe has a new dress! How fashionable, with that Indian-inspired print


(is the international cake comment a reference to Empire Cake, perhaps? Queen Victoria made that rather popular)
I absolutely adore her new dress!!
Kpop fans ain't got nothing on Ms.Crocombe fans 🙌🙌 yes I said it.
Mrs. Corcombe has to be my favorite Victorian person by now! Like a stern but loving grandmother who lets you watch as she cooks! :)
I would pay money just to be the Mrs of the house for a week and experience all those food and activity
Oof. Those jump cuts hurt my brain lol
Unnecessary zoom! Taking away your zooming license.   :)
Another great video, thank you.
WASSUP IT'S MA GIRL CROCOMBE OR ST. HILDA!!!
Love this music; love this place; love Mrs. Crocombe!
GASP there it is again. Another video!
Mmm Delicious!
I love Mrs. Crocombe
I want that butter pounder/smasher thing
Mrs. Crocombe looking fresh af in her new dress!
She's like, don't touch this, this last one is mine.  After all someone has to taste test it right?
For this RECIPE you will need..............................................................
Wish we had more of Mrs. Crocombe!
Truly delightful!
@threadbanger Corinne should make these
Sure looks nice. I do not have a problem  mixing batters with ones hands but i wonder if the real Mr Crocombe does do it. As far as i know, people back in the day are very into utensils when in the kitchen
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GONNA GIVE THIS WOMAN HER OWN COOKING SHOW
I was hoping for someone to do her in snatchgame. I was disappointed💔
I was hoping for someone to do her in snatchgame. I was disappointed💔
Love the new dress Mrs. Crocombe
These videos just get better and better. Mrs. Crocombe is such a delight!
I'll bet that smells wonderful while it's baking!
Mrs Crocombe, you look gorgeous in that new dress! It was a gift?
give her a netflix show
Is there a Mrs. Crocombe cook book? Because I need one!
Some ASMR going on in this video....
6:13 - I'm scared
❤️Mrs. Crocombe❤️ Also, I would love to make this cake.
Are we not going to talk about Miss COWley in the dairy?
I ain't makin this I ain't a servant
More please!!!
I love these episodes so much 💕
AMY IS REAL!!! AMY FARRAH FOWLER IS REAL!!
Mrs. Crocombe blessing my feed 😍😍
MRS. CROCOMBE! Where you been, girl???
I love all of your videos ❤️❤️
Dropped my whole life to click on this video! 😊
Mmmm, you've inspired me, once again!
Wondering about what is treacle.
Hey there saint Hild.....um I mean Mrs. Avis Crocombe
public health england's nightmare )
queen is back!!
A new frock for Mrs Crocombe, how lovely!
Yay!!!! The beloved Victorian Way!!!!!!!!
Looks so decadent.... im just itching to use a silicon spatula...😣
هل من عربي هنا ادعوني بليز
The Goddess has grace us with another video. We aren't worthy of your videos.
Just casually bragging about the international ingredients.   Jesus i looove her sassy attitude
I want to play dungeons & dragons with her so bad lol
I was on board until Mrs. Crocombe started stirring the batter with her hands lol
I like seeing her smile. 😊
At 6:05, when she pauses with that last piece in her hand, the look on her face let's you know THAT piece will not make it to the "head servants table;" and then , when she does indulge, I mean taste test for quality, the look n her face is priceless! Viva la Crocombe, Viva la Hipperson!
Simple yet looks delicious 😋
Yummy!! I need to make this next Christmas!! 😋😍
I don't know why I like watching this.
1:39 Health fanatics are having a meltdown.
I wanted to see how she cleaned that off of her hands. I think I could do that with a spoon, but maybe there's a reason for "hand" mixing?
Do you use light or dark brown sugar and do you measure it loose or packed?
That little face she made at the end when there was one piece beyond what her display required. Like "hehehe, it was all part of my plan! Nom nom nom."
This looks so good, I can almost smell it! I loved the comment about it being very international, it's something we don't think much about these days. It's also neat to see the food the servants would eat, there's not as much info in that area and I would love to see more recipes like this!
She has the type of personality I'd hate to encounter in real life, but I love watching her!
When the cake was cut into squares, they reminded me of a treat we have here called "cuca". I wonder if it's similar.
I was confused when you mentioned that you were going to use cane sugar until you mentioned that the cake was for the servants. 
Using cane sugar or brown sugar for a regular cake would not fly in the US during those times. Since it wasn't a processed as white sugar, people generally considered it as cheap, for commoners and slaves. 
Now a bag of brown sugar is more expensive than white sugar. How time's change, huh?
This cake is so good!
No cloves?? 🥺
So wholesome and pure ❤️
Is that a new blouse? 🤨
Mrs. Cowley in the Dairy? LOL
YAAAAASSSSSSS MRS CROCOMBE BAKE THAT CAKE BABEY
At what point does she go from mixing with her hand to a mixing spoon? Just happens suddenly.
Very nice  wonderfull  💜 ❤ 💜 ❤ 💜
Love the new outfit!
Loved it...
Similar to Yorkshire Parkin.
a new dress, finally!
Uhhh shadeee to the lowly maid!!!! Shadeee
Life was hard before the days of the rubber spatula.
5:54 if i cook omelet there how it will looks on that copper pan
I don't have molasses and ginger powder.
I love her when she tilts her head and says Mmmh
I have been so stressed all week this was just what I needed to relax
You have no idea how much I enjoy these videos
I'm not much of a gingerbread person but I would totally eat this. That's how good it looks.
New vid 7 min ago? I'm late!
She’s a good actress but not a chef.
LOVE LOVE LOVE! Please make many more!!!!
Should the treacle be sulphered or unsulphered
god i love you mrs crocombe
Seen that mixture somewhere else.....
YUS! More Mrs Crocombe!
The queen is back!
6:10 when u know it’s nasty Buh u gotta act for the video
It look like a bowl of poop, then when pouring into tin it looks really good. That is a serious transformation for a batter
who are the 48 that don't adore mrs crocombe??!?!
Adorrrrre these. <3
Czy tą czarną substancję można zastąpić miodem?
How long did it take me to click on this as soon as I saw it?....Zzzzzzt!!.....about that fast
Seems y’all know when I’m thinking about this lady and her cooking I get a  notication !
I Love this <3
6:10 me secretly eating a snack at 2 am
look so good 💗💗💗
This sounds delicious 😂
I love ginger cake and ginger Parkin 😋
Thank you for the recipe for this lovely gingerbread cake!  When my mother and I make our own ginger cake recipe, we serve it warm with lemon cream sauce poured over.  Delicious!
Mrs Crocombe’s got a new frock!  😃
Lovely British rhotic accent there. West Country or from somewhere else?
While I like the videos, you can always tell that she is not a chef or really even a cook since a real cook would never waste as much of the ingredients as she often does.
1st time she tastes her creation, right? That's nice. I really miss this part
Mrs Crocombe will you marry me?
new episode! yay! xx
These are my fav vids
I want to have the rest of the Black treacle.
Yay! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mrs Crocombe has a new dress!
New dress!!!!
I think I'm in love with her
So, no cake for lower servants :-(
The pours were slow as molasses.
Gosh it's years since I've had that
Did Mrs Crowcombe make a, mistake at 2.13. She said Oh.. And stopped mixing and then we see it  mixed a lot. 🤔 Perhaps not all the spice at once?
The servants are people too.
So happy for these videos!
I have a Mrs Beaton’s cookery book that’s over 110yrs old.
I really love that woman!
I love when she ate that last piece of cake as there was no space on the plate 😊
Would the upper class, the Lord and Lady, eat something like this. It looks like she's showing there's an upper-class type of food and a lower class type of food in these video's
They really needed spatulas back then.
Addicted from Rotterdam
I love this!!
Someone illuminate me, is "Treacle" the same thing as "Molasses"?
“We go through 3-4lbs of butter here everyday” 

Excuse me while I have a heart murmur
Hello from the West Indies!
Love how she is using her hand to mix. Best mixer me thinks.
Hm, that cooling rack looks anachronistic
I love you, Mrs. Crocombe, but DAMN it looks like you scooped that out of a baby's nappy
Mrs C's accent is all over the place in this episode - has she been at the cooking sherry?!
That batter is thicc.
I wish they would make a full tv show about her.
I love jugs full of milk
Neat to see our Mrs. C getting her hands dirty! Also I've never seen the trick of baking soda into the warm milk -- definitely going to try that!
Mrs. Crocombe has once more given me inspiration. One day I hope to try this lovely Gingerbread Cake.  I at once noticed the lovely new dress she had, perhaps the material a gift or would Mrs. Crocombe being in such a high position been able to buy material and have been able to have a dress made, or would she have had made the dress herself? Inquiring minds want to know.
I am so much a fan of English Heritage, love all the videos. Especially the Victorian way, and Mrs. Crocombe. Please do keep them coming.
WOW!  Treacle is far thicker than any molasses that I have ever used!  Sadly, however, here in the United States sugar is far more expensive than any other surrounding country because one local company essentially has a contract with the US government to privilege itself above other sources and to eliminate competition.
If we ever get a chance to go to England, Audley End House is going to be at the top of my must-see list.
Whats treacle?
Why do you mix by hand ?
I just love this one!  Is the first time I see you tasting it!! Very good and delicious!! Do it more often!!! I mean the tasting...!!!
What is trickle?
I just noticed that this is the first time that Mrs. Crocombe has cooked for herself and that makes me happy =D
Thanks.  I must try this, but I'll be using my Kmix to mix it up.  Regarding the hanging copper round implements, are they crepe pans, or lids for the bigger copper pots?  Thank you.
Another video!! Yaassssss!!!!
"This gets served to the TOP service table, the one I sit on." You get it, Mrs. Crocombe. Deserving that ginger cake, woman!
If serving gingerbread cake to the lower servants' table, don't bother cutting it up; just let them eat it out of the tin with their hands. They have to EARN slices.
She got a new dress!!
Is there a video on the hierarchy of servants and people in the house?
Mrs. Crocombe, you forgot the warm lemon sauce!   Without a doubt, the best videos on YT.
I love these videos - a fab insight into the world of the Victorian kitchen
I want an entire program of this show
Our Queen
YUM!
How to Make Colonialism Cake
Hi.  American here.  I've never heard of treacle.  Is that the British equivalent of molasses?
Ooooo. You should do an episode about kitchen first aid for burns, cuts, etc.
Treacle ,I believe is molasses in the US
Didn't you forget the brandy?
i had a hard time with her mixing cake batter with her fingers for some reason. there was a lot of yelling at the screen. That isn't bread dough. what are you doing
love the face at 6:12
I'm kinda confused, is it an actual cake or is it more like a brownie (hi I'm American)
mrs crocombe just cancelled light treacle
What la it a treacle ?
1
OMG! SHE FINALLY TOOK A BITE!!
😍👏
YUM <3
Pause at 6:12 to see the face of true guilty deliciousness :D
A little awkward without the music
I made this cake last night and it turned out delicious!
What an international cake!
We are on the train to visit right now!  All the way from Oklahoma, U.S.A
lmao is this for real
Is there a difference between using brown sugar and white sugar in this recipe?
Black treacle is molasses?
marranitos
I'd love to have someone like Mrs. Crocombe. I bet she and I will be bestfriend!
I love how she stays in character, and only tries the products when it's meant for her or someone of her status... like the this cake and some of the other stuff made for servants or commoners... it makes this believable...
I love these videos
I love these videos
Omgosh. Drooling lol! I realize this was "in the olden days", but what would I set my oven at? I,m in Canada. We need scratch n sniff technology!
Ah. Those are the time when salted butter is highly regarded than the unsalted one.
Please make a cookbook!
Wow, I was surprised that this recipe was so... hands-on, so to speak. But I suppose that's how people managed before the invention of the electric mixer and dishwasher. ;-D
2:12 I have no idea what happened, can someone explain?
I like how I went from watching Minecraft videos to this, and I’m not disappointed
This looks so nice! I might give it a go soon!
6:13 “mmm delicious”
Wonderful!!!
This looks so delicious and actually doable, I might try it. By the way, you forgot the eggs in the list of ingredients.
East Indies - India 😂
What is treacle? Cake looks yummy.
Forgive my ignorance, but whats the trickle?
6:04 That pause and stare "there you are ginger bread cake"
Oh my! Is that a new dress?!
Mrs.Crocombe is so cute
Mmmmmmmm, one of my favorites!
I love Mrs Crocombe
I used to decorate Ginger Bread house for Christmas ... I made hundreds of it.. but never tried ginger bread cake ... It looks decadent .. and perfect for high tea
Is treacle same as molasses?
She makes it look so simple!
I believe Mrs. Crocombe ‘turned’ her dress. This is where you remade your dress inside out and thus got double wear and had a new look at the same time.
Why did you use your hand it mix it?
Black treacle is molasses I see. I thought it must be that because your making Gingerbread yum yum. Thanks I had not thought to mix with my hands. I would use my wooden spoon. But that does look easier to do with the hands. Have a Happy Easter. And a great weekend.
New dress!  Love!
what a terrific way of spending this holiday 💕💕
Delicious
It looks dry to me.
east indies, my hometown
Not very ligth but surely very good !
I've never seen gingerbread made like this before, with the hand-mixing and such but what a luxurious, velvety batter! Isn't Treacle just another word for Black-Strap Molasses? Finally, is it just me or is she wearing a different color/fabric/blouse? Love this channel!!!!
So people are coming to my channel from this LOL it must be my demonstration how to make Treacle LOL what a wonderful series, glad to have it bought to my attention..
What are those flat pans hanging behind Mrs Crocombe?  Are they lids?  On the close ups, they look like griddles, almost...  And on an unrelated point, we have rubber and silicone spatulas for scraping gooey things out of mixing bowls...  What would Mrs. Crocombe have used?
I really need to make this. I'm pretty sure this is the same as my grandmother's ginger treacle cake and I have not had that in years.
eww looks groooooooooooooooos.
nope.......
I swear I could smell that cake through the screen after it was done baking! All I can smell right now is gingerbread, and I know I didn’t light my gingerbread incense.
I havé just clicked  so quickly even though it's 20h 41 here  , when are we going to see some of the other servants , you are still the best Madame Crocombe bonsoir de la Charente Maritime
YESSSSS!!!!!! MRS CROCOMBE!!!❤️
Why would you use your hand to stir?
Very similar to a cake popular in my country, only we also use cinnamon and nutmeg and far less molasses. If someone says "gingerbread" around me, this is usually what I think of even before the Christmas stuff.
Surely this is simply gingerbread? I have never heard it referred to as gingerbread cake. Is the "cake" a modern addition perhaps for your American fans to help avoid any confusion as to exactly what it is?
queen of knowing her indies
6:12 "I pulled a sneaky on ya" (btw Mrs.Crocombe is my favorite from this channel)
Happy Easter Mrs Crocombe!
These videos give me life
I'm just curious.. did they have at that time:
- a whisk ?
- bicarbonate of soda?
- baking paper?
🤔🤔🤔
That actually looks yummy 😋
What is black teackle?
2:30 hmmmm.....reminds me of something :/
I love watching these videos, but as a baker this one drove me nuts. The order of ingredients is all wrong. Add the baking soda and ginger to the flour, mix and set aside. Cream butter with sugar, add beaten egg, mix, add molasses (Treacle - sorry I'm from Canada we call it Molasses), water and milk mix, then gradually add dry ingredient mixture.
Yaaay. New vid!!
I wish she was my cook!
Nice cake.
What’s treacle?
I like the way there was a little bit of perspective added to this video—such as, this is a very international cake. We don’t often think about how international our food is nowadays, but sure...of course it still is, to some degree or another. And now it’s a little more affordable for servants or families to have a cake like this one. Also, this reminds me of something I saw on an episode of the PBS cooking show “Martha Bakes,” featuring Martha Stewart.... To get sticky, liquid-y ingredients out of spoons or bowls, try dusting the spoons or bowls with cornstarch first. This works with ingredients like honey or corn syrup—and I’m assuming this would also work for treacle.
CAN RICH PEOPLE EAT THIS TOO? LOL :D
Yay Mrs Crocombe!!!
She is wearing a different dress now!
SHES BACKKKK
The cakes look like they're dry but they probably are surprisingly moist or something. They look so good!!!
Pray tell, who is this mysterious Mrs Warrick?
what is black treacle?is that molasses
Needed this.  Today has been unhappy.
* tastes the gingrrbread cake *

Thinks: "Hell, what have I even made!"
On screen: "Umm... Delicious..."
Lovely
That wire cooling rack looking pretty modern. Can anyone confirm it’s authentic of the period?
“I’ll use my strong hand” All I could think of.
I know this recipe is supposed to be from the Victorian Era. But in modern recipes it still says you should put only ginger and cinnamon in gingerbread. In Germany gingerbread is (officially) translated with "Lebkuchen", but we put about 10 different spices in it like cinnamon, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, coriander, ginger etc. You can even buy this as a ready made spice mix. Aren't "gingerbread" (like in the USA or UK) and "Lebkuchen" totally different? I'm confused :D Can somebody explain?
You rock, Mrs. Crocombe.
Ok, Americans, I put the ingredients in a recipe converter:
3.9 cups unsifted all purpose flour 
1.75 sticks salted butter
1 cup brown sugar
1.4 cups molasses
4-6 teaspoons ground ginger
3 small eggs or 2 large eggs
1 teaspoon baking soda
a little warm milk

I can't attest to its accuracy, but I'm going to try it anyway.



EDIT: The converted recipe worked! I halved it and baked it in an 8x8 pan for ~30 min. I used about 1/4 cup milk.
i bet this cake gets stickier and tastier after a few days..if there is any left!
Did they do vegan/vegetarian cooking slot this time? I used to have a old cookbook that was about 130 years old. It was a lot of vegetarian recipes like stuffed putternut pumpkin and a protone (nut protone or wheat protone, the nut protone was mixed nut to a powder and mixed with a little bit water and vinegar/lime/orange and steamed same with the wheat (seitan)). I would love to see some vegan/vegetarian recipes if she ever did any. :)
I bet that is really moist, the key to the perfect ginger cake.
No leavening in the cake.  Yet it looks nice and light.  Is treacle in the US, or is it the same as Molasses?
As a foreigner, I'm still shocked that there's such thing as sugar tax. Sounds ridiculous, but after i read some articles about that, i can understand why. 

But why is it considered as luxury in that time? Is it like the spices (which i read, more valuable than gold)?
Had no idea treacle was a word until this video. At the same time I was like “aren’t you supposed to put molasses in gingerbread?” Clearly I need to go to bed.
If you're in America and can't find dark treacle, blackstrap molasses works pretty well too~
Where's the music in the middle of the video? The silence between her instructions was somewhat awkward...
I feel like just a little bit of icing would have really made the cake.
Reminds me of one of the first baked goods I made from scratch, gingerbread brownies. So yummy.
Why did she abandon the spoon!? 😑
Wow I’m learning a lot
Yall never bathe & stick ya hands into everything that's how disease spread oof Nasty but I love u mrs crocombe
"sugar from West indies... Spice from East Indies" casually references colonialism.
I love her new frock! It's different, I like it.
My grandmother makes this with a lemon sauce at thanksgiving. Love it!
I'm buzzed and it looked like diarrhea
Is treacle like molasses (mélasse) ?
Love me some ginger cake😍 going to do this tomorrow with the children
Did she get a new dress??
Was anyone else bothered she mentioned the Caribbean ("west indies") sugar trade but there was no note or anything about how awful the sugar trade was?
What ... is treacle ? it looks like molasses ? Help!
I wonder, why does it look greenish?
What is treacle?
What is treacle?
who else had to look up treacle only to find out it was molasses (which is what you thought it looked like and expected her to say)
💕💖💓💔💝🌸💞💐🌸💓🌸💓🌺🌼😘💕🌺
What did she use to cream the butter with?
looks disgusting
What’s treacle? 
Sorry I’m an American
I dont understand why she doesn’t use all of the ingredient, I mainly referring to the ginger I think it was, in this video, I’ve seen her do this with other things in the videos as well.  It’s confusing because it tells u how much to use but she doesn’t use that amount, does anyone know why? I don’t have any knowledge of baking.
black treacle..hmm..can I use another ingredient instead? My country hard to find black treacle.
Mmmm delicious is so fake
Why would she do it with her hands? Why not a wooden spoon like she uses later on? Someone please enlighten me..
Why was sugar being taxed? Or being singled out for higher taxes? Edit: watched it again; why did sugar taxes drop notably?
What’s treacle?
I love this but it really stressed me out that she didn't use a spoon to mix
What provides the acid to activate the baking soda?
Ginger cake in April? Don't tell me you guys are running out of recipes?!
Top Servants, eh?
Being a bit prejudiced, aren’t we, Miss Crocombe?
wait i’m confused ? is she actually like this or is she playing a character?
Gingerbread cakes sound delicious! I’ll have to add it to my list. However, I can’t find black treacle in my country. What could I substitute it for?
2:13 'what an international cake' 

You mean 'colonialism cake'
"What an international cake."

colonized people stare into camera
@1:57 - How come she's not whisking her eggs in her "trusty, copper bowl which whisks eggs better"??
Mrs C is bae
Gurl there’s a spoon right in front of you and you stir with your hands? I guess you need to get that nice skin flavour in the cake! 



Jokes aside tho great video I always love watching these
are there any substitutes for treacle? we don't have them here in the Philippines, methinks.
Love these videos! but not so much this gingerbread cake, looks too plain.
That looks like a poo mix lol
Is there an eggless version of this recipe?
Please someone, can you help me? We don't really use treacle here in Belgium so it is quite difficult to find out. Do you think it would be OK to replace it with something like maple or agave syrup? Does it cook the same? Thanks!
3:40: you are a servant? Or aren't you supposed to be working willingly? ..... servant means slave! ....
Mrs. Crocombe has a new dress! A word though...she did not properly cream the butter nor combine the sugar and wet ingredients sufficiently before adding the dry.
I'd prefer buckwheat honey instead treacle.
Es la versión inglesa de Sheldon 😂
As always, thank you! I have many questions (also as always). Why is it called ‘gingerbread cake’ and not just ‘gingerbread’ (as we do in America)? Is treacle the same as molasses? AND (finally) can you guys put the American measurements in the description? pretty please??
Why is she using her hands to mix? Is that something they did in the day? Doesn’t seem to have any value in terms of efficiency or cleanliness.
The whole time watching I’m like “why are you using your hands!” Lol haha but seriously.....why?!
We love reading your comments, and we're proud to have helped create a community of Mrs Crocombe fans. Many of you have asked similar things, so here is a quick rundown of FAQs.



For reference, more on ice cream, ice houses and water ices can be found here: http://bit.ly/2uE7oXN



WHERE DID ICE COME FROM?
Like most country houses, ice used at Audley End was harvested from frozen lakes and rivers during the winter (winters were colder in the 19th century). 



It was then packed into the ice house, which at Audley is located up a hill, about half a mile from the house. Ice houses were essentially deep wells, generally with drainage at the bottom, and topped with a small, igloo-like structure with a series of insulated doors to allow access. They could keep ice frozen for several years, to be used for setting jellies or making ices as needed.



When the Braybrookes were at their London residence, they would have bought ice from a commercial ice dealer such as the Gattis, who had a huge ice house located near what is now Kings Cross (you can still visit it - now as the London Canal Museum). This ice was harvested from North America, Canada and Greenland, shipped across to the UK and stored for sale as it was purer than British river ice. Artificial ice did exist, but was in its infancy.

 

WHY CHURN THE WATER ICE BEFORE MOULDING? 
If Mrs Crocombe simply froze her mixture she would get a block of frozen ice - an ice lolly (or ‘popsicle’). Churning it means she obtains something more like a modern day sorbet i.e. with small crystals, which is both nicer to eat and practical to serve. The ice would have been served on the table where diners would help themselves to scoops, easily taken off due to its relatively soft texture.



WHAT IS AN ICE BOX?
An ice box (or ice chest/cave) is essentially a fridge (the term refrigerator was in use, though rare in the UK). It consisted of a large wooden box or chest, with a lead box inside. The box was packed with either ice (to set jellies) or ice and salt (if freezing ices in their moulds), and regularly drained. You can see one today by visiting Osborne House on the Isle of Wight: 


WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER CHURN?
We wanted to show you a different method of making ices. Mrs Crocombe’s other churn is more modern (for 1881), whereas this method covers the introduction of ices to the UK in the early 17th century all the way up until the 1950s in some cases. 



You can replicate it at home using a metal container, such as a coffee canister, and a plastic bowl full of ice and salt. It has the huge advantage that it does not require constant churning – and the metal parts don’t corrode with the salt.
I dwell in a modest household, hence I shall use a fridge!
The little bit about the Queen is my favorite part. Really puts you into the setting of Victorian England with her little quips and gossip.
Am I the only one who just really want to see the family try to eat it? How do fancy people eat most of these recipes? How do you share this? I NEED TO KNOW.
Are you continuing your series on the other parts of the house oiek the gardeners? I'd love some lessons on folding and tidying up from the maids
I've never clicked on a video so fast! Love these so much.
God bless Nikola Tesla and AC power distribution, so we can all enjoy such stuff, without having to pay incredible prices for ice hauled in from the Arctic packed in sawdust.
Just when my day cant get any better! Promotion at work AND a Mrs Crocombe video?! Yes!

--
 Thank you everyone! 😅😁
sees a new Mrs. Crocombe video
STOP EVERYTHING!!
Mrs Crocombe should well be concerned about the sale of "penny licks"!
TB, cholera and other disease outbreaks were linked to them, eventually getting them banned in London by 1899.
I would eat that 😄
Also: you gotta admire the ingenuity of these people, managing to make ice cream in summer without modern appliances.
At this point, English Heritage really has only one option: produce a full length TV series on Audley End a la Downton Abbey.
All I'm getting from these videos is that I definitely don't have enough molds in my kitchen haha
Three crucial things in her kitchen
1. BRANDY
2. Molds
3. Ice Box
Whoever picked the music has to be commended... well done you!
I'm dying to see not just more of these kitchen videos, but more videos from other places around the house! How to care for temperamental flowers with the gardeners, the proper way to make a bed or clean a carpet with the housemaids, how to set a table or serve a turbot with the footmen, lessons on a butler's etiquette with Mr. Lincoln! The videos on this channel are so pleasant and with such high production value, I could spend all day listening to the laundry maids tell me about Victorian tricks to get rid of stains.
The Braybrookes were so lucky to have Mrs. Crocombe as their cook, everything she makes looks lovely!
Me: gasp A NEW MRS. CROCOMBE VIDEO!!!! 
Boyfriend: Oh God eye roll

There are two types of people on this planet.
This series is amazing. The food is just unusual enough to always be a surprise - as a person not used to English cooking I never really know what to expect in the end 🙌😄
"Do you want to visit the kitchens"
My heart says yes, but my bank account says no.
name something more quintessentially British than making something from another culture whilst mocking the same street vendors making the food originally lol
I would love to know the servings and how a lot of your dishes are served. Makes me nervous to think it would crumble upon serving.
Literally about to turn the wifi off but welp. Nope. Mrs. Crocombe's here!
Ok but how was this actually served at the table? For some reason I just imagine everyone chipping away at it with their spoons ahahah.
My crush: so... wanna hang out?
Me: no, gotta watch new Mrs. Crocombe.
My crush: what about tomorrow?
Me: gonna watch it again.
As a Philadelphian who grew up eating water ice, the amount of joy is overwhelming. Clicked like it would disappear
This has got to be the most wholesome comments section on YouTube.
I will actually try this, it looks interesting, delicious and refreshing
Amazing to think the popsicle would not be invented for another 25 years
You madame cure my depression. I love your videos to bits. The world doesn't deserve you're grace. You deserve queendom.
But how is it served? This series is amazing!! Definitely a top fav
I need Mrs. Crocombe to run my life.
The music always kind of reminds me of The Sims🤔
So, that sounds so good, especially after meals with rich food. I've become such a fan of these recipes. I'm so excited to try it sometime.
I love how she stands there, decorating it slowly...  Run woman, serve it ASAP,  it's about to melt!
I agree with her reaction to the Pennylicks.
There is a ginger marmalade-water mix sold in some Costco's; served hot or cold. I never knew they were a historical food item.
"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?"
Delightful as usual! Curious as to how this would be served once it reached the table? It looks pretty solid.
So candied peel goes in absolutely every Victorian dish. 


Better than pigeon's feet, I s'pose.
Funny I was just thinking of your videos today then I seen this in my inbox 
I love the molds she uses  so decorative 🙂
I love these videos, especially as I live in a small nearby to Audley End so I know the house and gardens very well
Upvoted without even watching.  This video just made my day.
Yay! I am so happy when I see Mrs.
Crocrombe!! This has to be the best historical series of an everyday Victorian lady! Thank you 🙏
I love these videos they never get old keep up the good work
Ever since Downton Abbey has ended. The only thing I am always looking forward to a period drama is this series because the head cook and her comeback to her story of the day.
Yum! I'll be making some this summer! But in my regular ol' freezer, historical accuracy be damned :D
Can we have something simple but delicious for the servants next?
Omg i long for more videos of her cooking!!
Thank you for keeping these techniques relevant. We may need them again.
Such wholesome and well-made videos. I love these! Glad to see Miss crocombe again
Loved how Mrs.Crocombe pronounced Australia as "Australier"
Fascinating as always!
I've never clicked on a video so frickin' fast. Absolutely in love with everything about it 😍😍
Zero dislikes , yayyyyy ♥️
If Mrs. Crocombe ever decides she doesn't need Mr. Crocombe anymore, Mr. AT502 would gladly step in ... just saying.
Mrs. Crocombe should have asked Edgar Ashman to help turn it.  I do hope we get to see more of him!
o boi I do love ASUTRALIER
Hooray! She's back!
The size of that spoon! ...... guess the devil is popping in for afternoon tea....
Our Queen! She hath returned to us!

Yeah, sprinklings of Early Modern English aren't exactly correct, but I'm just really happy to see another Mrs. Crocombe video in my feed.

Also, those are gorgeous molds.
I've made lemonade ice, but not marmalade. I'll have to give that a try.
“the wonders of a very large ice box” got me
This somehow fixes every aspect of my miserable life.  I love it so so much ♥️
Please upload Mrs Crocombe videos more frequently, also what happened to the second gardener? It's not fair to make us wait after you create all these amazing characters and storylines, absolute torture having to wait so long.
This looks delicious! I would like to try it with pineapple, and freeze it in individual molds for serving purposes.
Oh it looks so good, especially since it's already getting hot down where I am...
What happened to the ice cream maker Lord Braybrooke bought you?
Yummy!! 😋😋😋
I always go EXTRA for every video of Mrs. Crocombe's cooking. I mean I go full screen with 1080p video Quality no less. That's how much I love her!
I've read about the course where they served ices and I always thought it was ice cream they were talking about, guess I was wrong  :)
Slushies? I only know water ice
I just love this channel. The 1/4th British in me becomes positively giddy at the upload of each new video! I love British history, British cuisine, and the British people. Thanks for the new upload. God save the Queen! <3
Does anyone know what's the name of the music in the background? It's so charming and always brings a smile to my face!
Never clicked so fast!
I love The Victorian Way! 
My favorite videos are "Roly Poly pudding and Apple Cheese"! So relaxing to watch and knowledgeable!
Yaaaaaaaay new video! These always make my day💕
I’m so hooked on this channel!!! 
Everything about it is just simply amazing!! 
🍊🍊🍋🍋👌👌😊😊
Good luck taking that up stairs without it slipping off that plate. ;)
My queen throwing shade about hygiene is life 🎉
The background music at the starting of these videos is my JAM❤ 🎶
OHMYGOD ITS BINGSU. 😂😂 I was sitting here wondering wth is a water ice
Mrs. Crocombe, you're back!!!! Never been so happy. 
More please. 🙏🙏
Looks refreshing as hell, Mrs. Crocombe.
When I see a new Victorian Way cooking video


HENRY! SATTLE THE HORSES
Delicious and fresh for summer😋
Let's see then, if 28 grams liquid = 1 oz, 125g marmalade should = c. 4.5 oz. Yes?
So satisfying to watch it come out of the mold so perfectly 😊🌻🦋🍃. Love how they got stuff done, back in the day. Amazing!
For this recipe... You will need.... -my favorite catchphrase everrr
Ayy new video! I love the history thrown in there with the Queen and the Penny Licks! Great touch! Keep Mrs. Crocombe coming~ ❤️
I'm in luv with those series <3
I live for Mrs Crocombe!  Clearly, the United Kingdom has only one choice - give the Prime Ministership to Mrs Crocombe.
What is the music called or where can I get it from?  It's really nice!
I listen to these videos if I have anxiety at bed time. Helps me sleep. Its like a bed time story ❤🙏
I wonder what Mrs Crocombe would think of modern water ices. As a child my favourite was fluorescent blue in colour.
Another excellent video! Could you please make one on how to mae jelly the victorian way with cuppermoulds?
Mrs. Crocombe could make cereal and I’d still click in .02 seconds
Does anyone else have a jam like Beyoncé to the intro music?




Jus me? Ok I’ll die
I smell summer already.
Yussss! Ty I've been waiting for a video! :)
These recipes are so bizarre, like things I would probably never make, yet they’re so amazing and fun to watch being made.
Everytime a new video with Mrs. Crocombe comes out I immediately watch it and then I have to rewatch all previous ones.
My goodness I always love watching those
Videos I'm not sure if I can make this 
This recipe at the moment I believe but it's 
worth a shot when I can
I LOVE this so much ❤️ this whole series is amazing .
YAAAS 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 My queen 👸🏻 is baaaack
4:20 "Now that it's frozen, I shall put it in a mold.." elegantly, yet decisively, puts the lid down  WE LOVE YOU
Loves these need more uploads more often
Ya’ll need to do a collab with PriorAttire (based out of the UK). Borrow yourselves some Lord and Lady braybrook and have them eat some stuff Mrs. Crocombe makes
There’s nothing better than a Mrs. Crocombe cooking video. I wish this was on the food network 😭❤️
My favorite series EVER!  I click fast on your new vids!  And THANK YOU!
Gordon Ramsay = his lamb sauce

Mrs.
Me: saw Mrs. Crocombe putting ice on the bucket with her bare hands
Also me: sees the spoon
Me: w u t
Greetings from Malaysia. Love so much Mrs Crocombee's recipes!
That looks so refreshing. Thank you for this idea.
I CAME HERE AS FAST AS I COULD!! Mrs Crocombe 💕💕
Penny Lick. Mrs Crocombe.. Not very hygienic. Hahahahahah
The origin of Italian Ice stands😂 they have improved a lot
Been waiting for a new Mrs. Crocombe vid. Love these!
I'm not sure I have the remotest interest in English food,  historical or otherwise,  yet I can't stop watching these videos or reading the comments. 
This video series team has truly mastered their arts.
Honestly at this point they could upload a video of her washing dishes and I'm watching 😄
Who else thinks that ice is gonna slide right off that plate when they try and move it?
This is getting better with every video. Love the extra information we get about water ice sold on the streets 👍
I’m in love with english heritage, my dream si live in Ingland 🥰😍
Can’t forget the cheese. NEVER FORGET THE CHEESE.
I love that they have Copper pans just like in the 1800's, it is a nice detail
"Not very hygienic"
I love this woman.
Mrs. Crocombe, how do I serve the ice at table? I plan to make some for Easter Sunday, when the weather here in Coastal Georgia will welcome an icy treat.
Amo este canal ;-;;; Saludos desde ARGENTINA
The queen is back and I love it
Would that mould be a serving for one person? I Love the large crock bowl that held the ice! That's an amazing size!
Technically, it forces the ice to melt,  which requires energy, thus absorbing heat from your dessert, and lowering its temp beyond the standard zero degrees, Celsius while raising the temp of the ice. 😁
Hip hip hooray for Mrs Crocombe . Had to stop watching Coronation Street to watch
Any day becomes a great day with Mrs. Crocombe!
Thank you for your wonderful videos!  
I'm wondering, how does one eat water ice? With a spoon? Isn't it a bit hard to chew on?
Paddington!O Paddington! Where are you?!!
Love this lady
Love the recipes
Love the gossip..
I love her and the way she talks.
Hmmm Had no idea that penny licks/hygiene concerns led to Italo Marchiony creating the waffle cone. (Googled 'Penny Licks'). As always...I adore this  Mrs. Crocombe series.
Victorian bae! ❤
How I've missed you Mrs. Crocombe!
I live only 25mins away from Audley End, yet haven't been there in years. Will definitely be planning a trip back (especially if Mrs Crocombe is working the kitchens!)
I clicked on this video so fast! This was so lovely, as always!
I like how they filmed the pot from above, but we actually couldn't see anything 🤣 It looked delicious though 👌
Absolutely fabulous series. Thank you
Thanks for making my day and my week!
Mrs. Crocumb, your wonders enchant through the ages.  Thank you.  And please keep it coming.
i love those series...i wish they do more about life of people at breybrook.s mansion....
I’m curious as to how it is served individually.
Could we perhaps meet the Braybrooks sometime?
Always good to see you Mrs. Crocombe !  this is just in time for the spring season. I too would love to see the gardeners again.
New video on a Friday??? Couldn't get any better!! Tgif!
Hooray! I'm home sick this evening, and Mrs. Crocombe is just the thing!
I do wonder how one manages to get the water ice up to the table ssnd serve it without melting.
Thank you for making these wonderful food history videos. They are truly unique, educational and authentically entertaining!
"You can buy waterlicks from Italians on the street. You lick them from the cup, Not very hygienic and I dread to think where the ice is made"

See children, shade comes from reading. Reading came first!
where do you get all of these beautiful molds!?
I can't wait for these videos to get uploaded, they're amazing, thank you!!
136 peasants clearly can't afford an ice box
Too much work just to freeze some water. NEXT.
I love your videos too.. Please make more ❤
Omg I can't tell you how happy I was to see you posted a video!!!!!
I love these videos so much! Not only are they extremely informative about old tradition, as well as make you appreciate the hardships that our ancestors had to face, but you also feel as if you're there.
Who are the 11 ppl who disliked this? 😂
" to a pint of boiling water add about a cup of marmalade" 

but its not boiling 😂😂😂😂
Did Mrs. Crocombe ever create recipes of her own?
Australier. I love it. Hahaha
I love the music by the way!
When I think of Britain, Mrs. Crocombe always comes to my mind.
Love Mrs. Crocombe ❤️🌹❤️
Wonderful episode, I loved the recipe. I can't wait for spring and summer though, I hope we might see more of Edgar. I'd love his tips on taking care of seedlings, sowing and planting and generally any gardening.
Love this channel. This looks so good that I will try it myself. So easy to make! Thank you so much! Hugs from Norway.
I always enjoy these videos.  Thanks!
The work that goes into it is just amazing.
These always make me feel like we’re in the 1800s but with cellphones
I love this channel. I learn so much about a culture completely different from what I'm used to.
Mrs. Crocombe be spilling tea on the Queen
Very enjoyable as always! Thank you! 😊💗😊
LOOKS TASTY HOW DO YOU CUT IT UP TO SERVE? IT LOOKS LIKE TOO MUCH FOR A SINGLE SERVING. HAVE A BLEST DAY. ALSO THANK YOU FOR THIS PROGRAM I DO ENJOY IT. EDITH
I love your series and was so excited to see a new one! Will you guys do more with the gardener? I would love to see more of that too!!!
3:56 I really like that you add these little anecdotes, they just make the whole thing seem more realistic and immersive
I love watching English Heritage   videos 💖💖💖
Very interesting, as always. Love the actress.
My lower class self thinking-why not just take the meat alive on the ship instead of freeze it and butcher it here?
I randomly clicked this video but I'm so happy I did. The host is so charming and this look into the past is so fascinating!
WOW! SUBBED! SAW THIS AND INSTANTLY LOVED YOU!
I was travel back in time when I watch these videos!
As an italian I've never heard of those "Penny Licks"...marvelous video and information! Seems like there's always something to learn :)
I love these! As always, great video!
I love all the gorgeous molds she uses. I have an aunt who collects the antique metal molds. They are so lovely a beautiful.
It would be awesome if they stepped up their game and hired actors to play the Lord and Lady trying her creations at the top tables.
Me the whole way in: This is gonna be a Popsicle, isn't it?
So apparently the great great grandparent of what we know today as either a snow cone or Icee? I love this series!
This is classic legendary recipe and so easy to make it
Reminds me of the Phantomhive Manor😉😉😉 ( any Black Butler fans out there?)
What happened to Mrs. Crocombes ice cream maker?
Or wouldn't that be of any help with this kind of water ice?
I sense a trend that no Victorian can go un garnished. I feel that decoration is just as important as the food itself. presentation is very important in Victorian food I'm guessing.
I'd like to see how gardening is done the Victorian way 😊pleaaseeee..... 😁
4:59 cough was that a nod to Typhoid Mary?? ;)
Idk why but I’m triggered by “water ice”
Watching this before bed is zen.
In Germany, this kind of marmelade would be called "Gelee" (for example "Quitten-Gelee")
"the wonders of a very large ice box" 😂😂😂
“And I dare to think where that water ice is made.” THE S H A D E 💀
Mrs. Crocombe, I am sick today and feeling pitifully sorry for myself because, well, I am sick. But also because there seemed to be nothing worth watching on Youtube while resting.  And then, there you were!  Bless you.
I realy love this show,and I really love to see how they did this in the Victorian times😍!!
But what I'm quite curious about is how did they made candied peel in that era.
I would realy like a video on that😊!
Thank you❤!
Ms. Crocombe don't eat no street ice
I have a question, how did people get ice those days when there was no concept of refrigerator?🤔
The kween is back! Love these vids!
I do this with my Snoopy Sno-Cone Maker!
I don’t think you make enough of these videos
The perfect way to practise English listening comprehension!!!!
I think this is the only recipe I have all the ingredient for (except for the candied peel but thats decoration and my pleeb ass doesnt need that lol)
I love you Mrs Crocombe😋😍
Who needs the Queen of England when we have Mrs. Crocombe?
Pretty judgmental about the Italians - be-atch
Today was very very cold day 🤣🤣
This channel is amazing, literally going back in time
Your dress is beautifully tailored too !!!
So authentic absolutely love this channels authenticity
Thus sounded so nasty.... I had to click!
I wouldn't want one of those street water ices either Mrs Crocombe. We stan a hygienic queen
100 day's at sea from Australia, luv that ! :)
The only thing that I can't understand is why there wouldn't be some sort of scoop. Handling that amount of ice is painful! Other than that, I'm hooked on these videos! They're fabulous! 😃
These are such a pleasure to watch!
Thanks for sharing 👍 I do love all your videos, greetings from Denmark 🇩🇰
Lol Mrs. Crocombe has no time for street vendors and poor hygiene!
Mrs. Crocombe should teach us how to make candied peel since it comes up so often
How to Make Ice The Victorian Way?
Thank u for this awsm video
Amazing vídeo!
i think wooden ice scoop should be invented during Victorian Era??
Perfectly lovely, as always.
Wow.. so much work for a popsicle in the olden days I am so impressed
I do a little dance whenever there is a new Ms Crocombe video! :)
i luv this lady❤😝😝
Anyone know more quality channels about Victorian servant life, it's fascinating
She is back!! I was so excited to see a video featuring Mrs Crocombe. Wonderful! I never thought about Victorians having water ice and ice cream.
How many would this particular Ice serve?
I would love to visit this place atleast once in my life ❤
Yeah this is my shit! Edit: in a good way
I love these videos so much!  It has become my not-so-secret obsession.  Would you consider doing a video or two of Lord and Lady Braebrook enjoying the culinary delights made by Mrs Crocombe?
My dinner almost burned because I had to stop and watch Mrs. Crocombe.
What a refreshing episode. Many bright colors. Well done ♪ Mrs. Crocombe has such a grounding effect. After a hectic day of work, it's just nice to settle down with a snack or a drink and enjoy a video of The Victorian Way.

I do agree that it would be nice to see The Braybrookes enjoy the food for once. I know that it's way more expensive to pay for extra talents and again, this is just brainstorming. Also, I'm not sure how it will affect the entire dynamic of the series and how it will affect Mrs. Crocombe's image. I do understand that, with the current flow, Mrs. Crocombe is a sort of "authority" figure since she's always portrayed as the head honcho of the kitchen. Portraying her role outside the kitchen, side-by-side with Lord & Lady Braybrooke, might potentially ruin the magic by bringing her "submissive" side too much to light. Or perhaps camera tricks can help keep the focus on Mrs. Crocombe? I dunno. Just throwing ideas ♪ 

Another amazing episode! Thank you for making these~ Please take good care of our Mrs. Crocombe ♥
When i started to read the storm and silence series I really got fascinated by the victorian era. Thanks sir rob!
Someone tell Mrs. Crocombe about that non-stop flight from Perth to London. It’ll blow her mind.
That ice part was ASMR for me
I love your videos! I find them satisfying to watch 😍😍😍💜💜💜
I just wanna say I wouldn’t care about a lot of these recipes but the way this channel presents the information is just so charming I just love it
That looks so juice and delicious! Great job!
How do you keep an ice box cold in the summer?
THE QUEEN IS BACK!
Hey.. I just noticed.. the container she used to keep salt is an Indian container. 😍
Ms. Crocombe: To a pint of boiling water...
Me [eyes twitching]: The water isn't boiling but if Ms. Crocombe says it is then IT'S BOILING
Would love to see the ice box
Savory, sweet courses and then maybe cheese, followed by a water ice. And what do we have now? Blended bananas and spinach which people call a meal.
But like how does one eat this?
I love this channel.  I don't have any English heritage, I'm just extremely fascinated.
I love your videos. I love the setting. One question: what is the Sabi thing you make it in. I tried to look it up, but I can't even spell it. I just like to know for the sake of the knowledge!
just oppulence.... you earn everything miss crocombe
This is a really interesting idea but I'm kind of wondering how this would be eaten. Does everyone get one?
Aaagh! Why didn't YouTube notify me?????!!! I clicked the bell! I'm almost one day late to my Avis fix, this is unbearable!
Back at it again Mrs. Crocombe!
I gotta see what an ice box looked like back then.
I keep telling my mom we should make one of these Victorian recipes but she says I’m out of my mind because we dont have the time or patience to even make a plate of cookies lol.
Btw I  want that  ice
A good recipe for summer here in PH
I don't like marmilade. But I like the other video and recipes. And watching you make them is so satisfying.  And the little bits about the people who live in the house. Lovely.
I have all the ingredients for this, and none of the tools.  Dang it.
Must've been for the very wealthy only. The making of this must've cost in todays terms at least 100 Quid.
the british really colonized 3/4th of the world for spices and didn’t use a single one
The water is not boiling, or am I wrong 😅
Very fascinating and I am sure the ice must taste amazing. However, given the time and where the ice came from I would imagine ice at the time was rather expensive and it seems this recipe calls for quite a bit of ice and seems rather wasteful. Was this something that was eaten often or only on certain occasions?
And there you have it, a Victorian popsicle
This woman seems like professional at everything she do like my college teacher
اكو عرب😂
Most splendid for a hot summer day!🌹
I literally squeaked when I saw the new video!
Am I the only one who looks at Mrs Crocombe as a non demoniac Sebastian version?
Ugh too bad I can’t trace anything back about my heritage thanks to the English. 🤷🏽‍♀️
MY FAVORITE!!!!
My afternoon is now happy: A Mrs Crocombe Video!!! I swear if English Heritage publishes: "A Book Of Victorian Recipes From Mrs Crocombe's Kitchen" I will buy it immediately!
These videos give me so much joy and peace. Please never stop making them
I love her sassy-catty-ness. And to be honest, I need moreee!!!! Remember when she shade the guests in Apple episode??? Uuuhh sassy Britss
Is that copper on the top of the building or glass? I'm assuming copper due to the greenish color.
I loved the quiet working portions that were mixed in to this episode!
I'm an Indian and I love watching Mrs Crocombe's vedios. Love from India.🇮🇳♥️
love it ♡♡
She's back!!!! Loved the reference to the Queen.
Can we use milk instead of water? Or would that alter the texture/thickness too much?
I remember making  toast water at school! 😟😟😟😟
I feel like these just keep getting better, I'm going to be so sad the day this series ends; I hope someone finds another historical figure in another time to do this with.
Please please make more videos like this!
Ah, a Victorian Slush Puppy.
Beautiful.  But, how would it be served?
am I being too nitpicky pointing out that the ice looks made by a contemporary ice machine
I live to learn from Mrs. Crocombe
😍💗💗💗💗💗💗 this is amazing piece of art.
Im making a Ms Crocombe fan club who wants in
How do they serve it individually from the final form?
ive watched so many of these that the intro music has conditioned me to relax whenever i hear it
We've missed you!
My favorite quote is "The wonders of a very large ice box!" Which starts at 3:55. In the 1960s my American parents, transplanted from the rural South to Northern California still referred to the refrigerator as an ic box!
This was wayyyyyy more sexual than it needed to be 😅
So...you put salt on the ice but not in your food? Seems legit
I love how she gets so into character
Could you make a bloopers or outtakes video?
How would you serve it?
I'm not even English and I enjoy these
How much i Love watching Mrs Crocombe 💛
Sounds and looks very refreshing
YAY!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Lemon + copper vessel = royally bitter
This is so satisfying to watch, it makes me relax
This just brightened my day! I love getting this notification! ❤
What will be life without Mrs.Crocombe ?
This popped into my life at the right time; I just went through a rather tense and terrible break up and had spent most of the day crying over it. I was attempting to calm myself down when I was recommended this video, on a whim I watched it and it was soothing and distracting enough, which lead me to watch a whole lot more of these cooking/recipe videos and I found myself calmer and much less sad than I had been in days. It's just a little historical video but it did wonders for me. Thank you so much for that.
She always looks so proud when she finishes a dish. I remember the "Meet Mrs. Crocombe" video where the historian/actress says that she's not a cook. The look on her face is why I like to learn so many different skills and crafts. That "Well, that doesn't look too bad at all!" expression is what I live for.
I'm still waiting for her cookbook to be published
Build my house from barley rice, green pepper walls and water ice...
Song by cat stevens, but I didn't know what 'water ice' meant till now.
Would have loved to see how this dish is actually served to the diners.
She should do an asmr Victorian cooking episode that would be Soo relaxing !
These videos save my day.
She sounds like Rowena the witch from SUPERNATURAL even though she doesn't have a Scottish accent.
thanks for posting
Wonderful as always. It’s strange but I forget about every stress I have when I watch these videos
I really like the theme in these videos, something about it feels nostalgic
i really love your voice!!! 💛💛💛💛
Somebody turn this into a TV series
100 days in a humid place. wont that spoil the meat?
Adorável!!! Amo todos os vídeos!!!
Why did you process it with the ice and salt if you were going to put it in the ice box to freeze in the end anyway? Is it a texture thing? Thank you!
I clicked because of the title.
Okay I didn’t appreciate ASMR until this video ❤️
That's very smart and delicious 😋
Yaaaaaas! Mrs Crocombe is back!
How about that sweet sweet asmr?
Always a pleasure, ma'am
These series are the best
Oh, thank goodness! No feet in this one. Whew!
I watched her videos because of the accent
please never stop doing these or im gonna cry
No ‘em fancy smancy freezer machines
ASMR THE VICTORIAN WAY
Where did they get the ice from back then? Just wondering 😅
The lord should paint the walls ....
Would you cut it like a cake to serve it?
How would you even eat that?  Is it served to a group?  I'm confused how it doesn't immediately become a big mess.
Never heard of it before
yeheyyyy!!!!
Omg that penny lick story wow. Live history! Cool sorbe
Wow!  I actually had a sense or feeling that you were making a frozen citrus flavored dish today before I clicked to watch. I absolutely adore these videos. They give me a visual on my love for historical romances that I have been reading for years. English in particular. Thank You!
Did I hear her say AustraliER
23 italian street sellers disliked the video
This is so satisfying!
I love the small little trivia facts she puts in there. The bit about the penny lick was so interesting
These videos are a genuine delight.
Why is this on my recommended, I feel so uncomfortable now
I love Australier... 🤣💖
British accent 😍
I know they use like Stuff from the Olden days But Why cant they just use a fridge
That looks so delicious! :)
I would have just put it in the mold first
I am from Turkey and I love Mrs Crocombe  videos i have even made some of the meals
we have missed you
Yes!!!
How they made ice in Victorian era?
Fantastic recipe😍
I feel like I've missed alot not watching this series from its beginning. What a miss.
Man life was hard back then!!!
Water ice? Such a strange name.
Paddington enters the chat
Could you use an automatic ice cream maker to make this?
This should be a show on the TV !
Lovely, thank you!
why did she put the mixture on bucket of ice before putting it again on freezer..? i mean why don't she just put it immediately to freezer.. was it to make more texture or just simply to prolong the video..
Ice canday raman nas amo oy
Honestly I want a full series on everyone in the house. The maids, gardeners, and the main family. I want a real Downton Abbey experience!
Ice candy mana diri sa philippines hehee 💗
Lol just make Jello and  add stuff to it lol
There was a major cholera outbreak in the late 1800s attributed in part to the Penny Lick.
I think cooking helps people to relexs and have grate time. The recepie is grate. Thank you.
Amy Farrah Fowler approves this
i’m sorry this happened to you.
big popsicle ❤️
so it's a Victorian Popsicle. I wonder what a Victorian slushy is called.
1:22 that echo 👌
Some of the garden beds look like Thors hammer! Is that intentional? Just wondering considering the time period of the house and how they run it. Wouldn't a heathen sign be a no no for the time period?
I dare say, I like reading the comments almost as much as I love watching these videos!
Good bless Thomas Addison and Tesla
Anybody who does know the background sound in the video of Mrs. Cocrombe, I like it, but I don't know the name of that one?
yum!!
I really want those moulds.
Second time viewing this
I'm not sure what's more amazing: sunshine in Britain or that someone outside of the Delaware Valley/Greater Philadelphia area uses the term water ice instead of Italian Ice
4:00 AustraliRRR
how refreshing that looks
Ive seen candied peel before in other  videos, Im not sure if I just dont know much about cooking or if its mainly European, but what would be the American equivalent?
How big is Audley End House? How many acres (or meters) in the estate, and how large is the house? While I found the house plans online, I can't find the information on the exact size of the house. Thank you.
this is my favorite era
Just in time for summer!!!!
Are there any more Easter Victorian recipes?
This gives me my smile for all day.
I have missed her
GORDON RAMSEY HAS LEFT THE CHAT
LONDON IS TYPING
This video makes me what to tell my cat to say “Woof”
I live for this
Isn't it dangerous to be gasping at ice cubes like that with salty hands?
If they had a freezer, why bother with the bucket of ice?
Who else is from the u.s and loves this channel
How do you serve it?
IMMEDIATE CLICK
I honestly love these
i love it so mush
Unintentional ASMR.
I like this channel 😘❤❤❤💞💞💞💞
That reminds me raspados or hielotos
I love this series
As always its a pleasure!
Damn YouTube’s recommendations are lit atm hahaha
I can’t believe mrs crocombe invented the slurpee can she get more iconic
I find these videos very soothing to watch.
Australiur
How do you eat it?🤔
Interesting comment about sorbets. I've made sorbet many times, but nowadays the recipes do not very often call for alcohol.
I’m in love with the act and the actor/s. Taking care of all minute details is the reason behind your success. Congrats
Hpw is it actually served?... A slice or scoop or what?
And now I shall add the feet.
A Victorian slushy - nice
How could anyone dislike this video?? They must be very very sad people.
I live for these videos!
How would it be served
Moreeeeee episodes please 👏
And here were just throw everything into the freezer. XD
Here's the thing, this is all very well and good.....but what the flibberty gibbet is water ice?!?!?!?!?!
The main thing I've taken away from this channel is, it you can prepare it, you can put it in a mould.
That accent is a bit different from the modern British accent. Is that how people talked in Victorian times?
Howd they make ice back then
nice vid #inspiration 🙌 gave me some ideas for my channel!
YEEEEES!
At 4:48 Mrs Crocombe says "I'm gonna use candied peel" I was wondering if they said 'gonna' back then as like a dialect thing or if it was just accidental?
500 likes and 0 dislikes :D
This looks delicious! I can almost taste it. Yum!!!!
Wasn’t salt really expensive back then?
Victorian pizza? Eating it rn 🤣
Thats one fancy popsicle
That ice was a mAjor asmr
How was ice made in those days??
So.... a Victorian slushie?
This sound so good
Gordon Ramsey vs Mrs Crocombe
Heck yes
So how did they make ice?.obv it wasn't from the servo down the road
She needs a thermomix
I hope a sorbet video is coming.
How did it magically turn bright yellow?
Shes back!!!!
Penny licks was my nickname in high school
I love you
For a second the thumbnail made me think you made the marmalade ice as big as you
Nn entendi nd, mas a vibe dela eh mto boa
When will we add the feet?
Is this where we in Philly got our name for Water Ice?
But how do you eat from it?
I want some of her marmalade. T H I C C
I could seriously watch this every day!
Love these videos
The only channel not to get demonetized
No wonder Queen Victoria was so thick, she was eating all these good meals haha
Im waiting for a jhon mclean collab
Howdy, Mrs. Crocombe!
I would have liked more information on the ice box / ice chest, and also where Mrs Crocombe got her first batch of crushed ice for the recipe. Was this something seasonal and only sourced during winter? Was this household wealthy enough to have ice year round, and what were the costs for something like that? Etc etc.
Homemade pineapple
This is a thing? I never knew this was a thing
I want her autograph so badly
Trabalho da peste
MOTHER IS BACK
THE CANDIED PEEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I absolutely love these videos. I do have a question though, how would this then be served at the table? I mean it's not exactly easy to cut ice in a "neat" fashion. Would it not have been easier to just have personal sized molds?
How do you even serve that
I wonder if Chef Ramsey could reproduce these items using the same cooking skills like they did back then?
The Victorian Way is so wholesome. Although I have no intentions of recreating any of the dishes, nor do I cook, nor am I English, I still enjoy watching Mrs. Crocombe who is just delightful and entertaining! <3
How was it served?
SHE MADE À POPSICLE
Looks easy and delish! Has anyone tried yet?
How is this served? Is it cut up for all to share?
What difference between jam and marmalade??
イギリス訛り難しいな...英語字幕みないとまだ聞き取れないことおおい😭
Is water ice the old fashioned version of a slushy? Just wondering, it sounds and looks similar
I surely hope the queen enjoyed the meat we sent her.
Where did they use to get ice from in those days?
Creame ice……”ice cream”😊❤️
Is there anyway the public can purchase the kitchenware and pans?
Dream kitchen
Já pensou se fosse a Nigella
I LOVE HER!!!
Icee who?
How would they eat it tho? Spoon? Fork?
is she using ice to make ice :0
I just like that it's called 'water ice'
Where would you get the ice in summer back then??
So after the decoration of the marmalade water ice... what are you supposed to do with it?! Its solid frozen and sitting on a flat plate lol
This is cool but....how do you eat it??!
Give it a good wangjangle
I wonder how they make ice in Victorian era? There wouldn’t be any fridge at that time, right? 🤔🤔🤔
So it’s technically a fancy slushy
Why do you salt the ice?
Im thirsty already
Mrs Crocombe>Buzzfeed Tasty
This channel could make a video on how to make Victorian Ice cubes and I sit through the whole thing.
These videos are great
Lovely video! Hope to see another episode soon:)
Love these videos so much
En Puerto Rico eso se llama Limber
That's huge😏
The kween is back
Ok where do they get the ice?? I've read about a method in Little House on the Prairie but Idk if it's the same one.
I love this so muchhhhhhh
I’m confused why there would be any dislikes but at least for now it’s 2🤧
He accent is so pleasant
Folks, you have really made this Louisiana gal work to get the names of things right. I kept thinking to myself, what is that thing she's talking about, that jar thingy she's putting the water ice into? I finally found it ~~ it's a sorbetiere. BTW, love the videos, adore Mrs. Crocombe. Quickie question: are there any Victorian seafood recipes (not just prawns served with kedgeree or lobster for a sauce)? Y'all take good care!
So a slush puppy???
How do they get and store ice in the past?
Well that was a waste of time filling that bucket with ice only to put it back in the freezer 😂
How are u supposed to eat that
These videos are so calming to me. I put them on and fall asleep to them at night :)
Interesting. Never heard of this food
Stop talking start pouring
3:30 when your poo hits the toilet.
YES
i dont know why but im obsessed with these
Does this make anyone else SO THIRSTY???
That is a slurpie.
Cheers from America
Can you try to make apple pie the victorian way?
WHY AM I BINGE WATCHING THIS ?!!?
I think a lot of the viewers, including me, would love to learn more about Mrs Crocombe. Not just her character, although that would be just as amazing! We would like to know more about her background. Does she live the "victorian way"? As in has she adopted the victorian lifestyle as an every day lifestyle? Or is it simply something she does for this channel? This series is one of the most entertaining series on youtube and watching this is both fascinating, and educating. Thank you for producing such fine content, and we, the viewers, hope to see more of it in the future.
Loved it
WHY do you just not freeze the liquid in the mold initially?
the victorians were the first modern people, as far as i can tell
How did they make the ice tho?
Does everyone get their own or do they all share one?
I wonder how it is served at table?
So… it’s a solid, orange slushy..?
we STAN
so its a slushie?
How did you freeze ice then when it isnt winter?
How did they make/store ice back then
😲😃 amazing
How ice was made at that time? Taking from ice mountain or people can make them self?
yayaytays
Another excellent video!
Aaaand how is it eaten?
Amazing!
Where did they get ice.. And how did they concerve it?
Help me understand... There weren't any freezers then?? How did they create ice?? How were things kept cold/frozen??
I'm genuinely curious.
중독성있어...
what a soothing video!
How is it consumed?
I don't have a bucket like that. I would just chuck it in a silicone mold cover it with plastic and chuck it in the freezer. I'm sure that shall work just as well though it won't keep the traditional method.  I always enjoy watching these type of videos and been curious to try some of the food made in this series.
I can watch her all day cook and pray she would serve me a plate
👍😋👏
Interesting
Love it !
It’s like a Victorian popsicle!
I love you so much!!!
I recently purchased a copy of Dr. Chase's Recipes or Information for Everybody, published 1866, and was intrigued to come across a recipe for "Ice Cream - Very Cheap" which called for steeping irish moss in milk then freezing as usual, which I found very interesting. I'd love to try it, although I don't have an ice cream maker, nor do I know where to buy irish moss.
How do you cut/spoon this??!!
good ol days chaps
I am wondering and I am sorry this is probably a ridiculous question. In Victoria Era, where did they get ice cubes and how they preserve the ice cubes from melting either in transportation or in a household? Thank you for your help to educate me 😊

Great video as always!
What does the salt do then? And why is it called “water ice?”
water ice is a posh way of saying slushie
👍
Why do you layer the ice with salt ?
😊😊😊😊👍
How does one eat the water ice? 😅
Hope she's transported back in time in the Victorian Days.
Mrs Crocombe is my favourite youtuber. <3
Okay I get that it’s victorian age but they still have cups why not use a cup to scoop the ice for the maker
English people are an interesting ethny
I love these videos!
Hmm I have some marmalade sitting in the pantry, maybe I should give this a try
Dame what she got against penny licks lol
I hope they use the music that fits the era...
To those wondering how it would be served:  
1. No this is not an “individual” dessert. It is intended to be shared. There was not enough ice or time available to prepare more than one at a time. Also, serving sizes in those days are not like the huge servings we are accustomed to in modern times. 

2. It would have been served by a footman/waiter. Put into smaller bowls at the table and eaten with spoons

3. The finished water ice dessert would not actually be as “solid” as shown in the video. This one was obviously frozen in a modern freezer

4. The addition of marmalade (containing natural pectin and sugar) would make the finished dessert more slushy/ crystallized than shown. Also the temperature of a bucket of ice at room temperature would be warmer than the temperature in a modern day freezer so the final result would not be frozen solid in the middle of the mould

5. It would begin melting immediately once on the serving plate since the houses were not air conditioned in those days

6.  It would be easily broken down /crushed  with a large serving fork and scooped into serving dishes with a serving spoon. 

7. This is a luxury item/ status symbol because ice was difficult and expensive to obtain.
Es puterrrr
So, Victorian Popsicle?
💖💔💞💖💔💞💖💔💞💖💔💖💔💞💔💖💔💞
Marmalade water ice? So, a victorian version of a frozen lolly? I feel the victorian way might as well say a victorian desert.
Wow, makes me think of how easy we have it now-I've made my own water ice, sorbet, & ice cream, but it's a matter of flipping a switch on my Cuisinart ice cream machine & letting it do its thing for 20 minutes😂Though I would find it interesting & fun to try this method!
But where did the Ice come from?
Hahahaha
Ah life then!  The servants were worked like slaves and the wealthy were a bunch of inbred dolts doing nothing useful all day.
Amazing
Where did they find ice on the victorian times though??
I would like to see vines of this person
Why does this woman have her hooks in me? shes so entertaining.
so how did you get the ice to freeze your marmalade ???
English the looters
I really want to try this recipe this summer when it gets warm.
So you made a slushy
awwwwww
Is it the same as "sorbet"?) Like your videos!
Well, what would be the etiquette way of cutting it and eating it? Would they have just dug in?
The types of foods and desserts they came up with back then 😂 so interesting and tempting to try
That’s a fancy  raspado I mean, a Victorian raspado
how did they make ice back then?
This looks awesome. My mouth is watering! I’d eat the whole damn thing by meself lol
How do you eat it? With a spoon?
where i can buy the corset that women use ?
But.....where did the ice come from?
I thought it was gonna be huge in size
very beautiful 😘☺☺☺☺
How they made ice that time?
cool
I know I am quite late! But I do know I have some leftover marmalade, I might try this if I just manage to do it right.
Time to make my ice lollies guys!
thought it said ‘Mamalade’
She presents the world's probably easiest recipes but with such a delightful way. Here in India summer has begun and this video is so soothing especially when I am watching it at midnight. Well, I must thank you.
Where did they get to ice in the old days?
Wow New Video.
I always wondered what Victorian ices were. I read a pdf file of a Victorian manual of politeness and etiquette for ladies and it mentioned handing out ices at dinner parties. Now I know what they look like
But what do you do with it? How?
Pennylicks
It feels so incomplete without seeing someone actually taste it. I have no idea what the consistency is, and it's driving me crazy. Is it solid, almost like ice? Or is it soft like sorbet? Do you eat it with a spoon, do you break it up with a fork, do you cut it with a knife? I need to know! 😩
Jesus christ.... the royalty free music they used in this video is utterly obnoxious and ear piercing. Find less harsh music clips and when you do, make sure the volume is adjusted appropriately. The song volume in this is way too high and overpowering
Yummy its to hot where i live
I’m watching this in class
Sorry if this is a stupid question.... but how did Victorians make ice? x
I just googled about Penny Licks, and I have to agree with Mrs. Crocombe. No one want their glass unwashed between customers and getting contracted diseases!
Where did they get the ice in those times?
good cook and amazing actor
All "Victorian way" recipies are sooo expencive :P 

Or maybe it just looks like it :)
When she was talking about water ice I thought she meant aguas frescas
I don't understand it. Is the ice kinda like a snow cone ice or...??
Refrigerador? En el siglo XIX? Really?
Lovely
Took me back in time to when I would visit my grandpa and he'd make us ice cream from the season's fruits every summer. Love the meticulous detail in not just the decor but the script as well. P. S. Where do you get the brass and copper cookware. I've been searching for it for ages....
What the hell is water ice
I’ve not been amused with most of the recipes... they’ve pretty much taken from everyone.  I think the only thing that is there’s is ...
I dont know why i thought salt to ice was a fairly recent thing(last 50 years or so.) Mrs Crocombe was a very smart lady if the recipe gives a generic reason as to why to salt the ice. Great recipe as always and if you dont have a sorbetière. You can use a modern ice cream maker or do it granita style where you pour it in a glass dish and scrape it with a for every half hour for 2 hours or untill you get a firm but soft slush.
Just wondering why she didn’t put the mix in mold in the first place
How they eat that? Crush it with spoon or cut it? Pls dont say they lick it together... 🤔
How did they get ice back then??
Who else always wants to eat all the food
Bet it taste like shiet
Yay!
Yay!
Wait. How did people make ice if there was no freezer
Great video!
Great video.
How do you eat it?
Who has that much marmalade on hand
How did they even have ice back then
So she made a giant popsicle?
I am DIE-ING! for those ices moulds at the end!  Big £££ if you can even find them nowadays.
What does the salt do?
How did they have ice back then I know probably a stupid question
Do you eat this like a popsicle? How would you share with others? It's looks delicious though!
Couldn't she have used that ice cream maker she rubbed in our faces a while ago?
I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but is this basically an old-fashioned popsicle?  It sounds tasty.
Mrs Crocombe is bacccckkkkk
This will sound dumb but how do you make ice during victorian times? 

Back in the day, the rich folks in my country (i live near the equator)would import ice from other countries. Im just curious how were they able to make ice during an era where there is no refrigeration yet.
Yaaaaaasssss! I miss Mrs. Crocombe
Do you make your own marmalade and how do you serve this ice water? I like you in your kitchen!
Victorian frozen Kool-Aid lol.
How is she scooping that ice with her bear hands:/
So in 2080 she will make how to make potato chips 2014? You
Where do they get the ice from? How does the icebox stay cool? So many questions. Look amazing actually, love these vids! If someone could answer those questions, that would be lovely
Can I ask, where did she get the ice? Did they have an ice box capable of making it, or would they have bought it in a town?
How did they freeze ice back then??
I have learn one thing about salt !  Thank you
God help me I’m thinking of trying some of Mrs. C’s recipes.
mrs crocombe, is smokin!
how they made ice before? sorry if its an stupid question lol
I liked the casual xenophobia, very historically accurate.
Marmalade is disgusting
Where would they get ice in the summer?
is this similar to granita?
how do they eat it ?
Mrs. Crocombe, you have SNATCHED my wig with this new recipe
Where did she get the ice?
Which English accent is this?
What’s water ice
I'm confused if I should call her accent Irish or Londoner British. Sorry but I'm a non-British so I don't know much about the variety of British accents XD
How did they get ice in those times?
It’s a block of ice, how on earth do you eat it?? Do they pass it round and lick it?? 😂
Soooo.....like an old school popsicle?
Basically a frozen snow cone
What kind of fantasy is that?
how do they eat it? like shaved ice?
How did they freeze things back then? No electricity, how could they make an ice box(fridge)?
Can someone explain to me why she partially freezes it then puts it in the mould? Why not just pour it straight into the mould then freeze?
I just made a batch of grapefruit marmalade that I could use for this! Would this work in an ice cream churn? It looks like it might be like sorbet or sherbet.
What did she say a sorbet is? I’ve listened 3 times and can’t figure it out... feel like I need subtitles sometimes :/
I feel like 'penny licks' is a term wasted on a frozen street treat.
A water ice is a Victorian age slushie.
What's the difference in cream ice and ice cream?
How did you get ice back then?? Import it from Norway like in Frozen?
Mrs. Crocombe:

Everyone: oh wow she really did that ugh i stan a snatched qUEEN
Where do the peasants get ice during summer in medieval times?
How did they make the ice in the first place?
How did ice happen in Victorian times..? I mean like, what refrigerating techniques would allow for ice on demand? Obviously you can’t just pop water in the freezer in this period— can you?
Whoa! I live in Philadelphia, USA and I thought this was the only place in the world that had water ice. Literally everyone I meet from outside Philaphia, including myself because I’m not a native, have never heard of water ice so it’s really bizarre and awesome to hear it was a Victorian treat!
I really like these videos, but find it really cringey that you can hear echo when Mrs Crocombe speaks. A kitchen like that would have been bustling with activity back in the day. Perhaps hire a few extras to be in the background or to help her?
That looks great! When could we be shown more of how people cooked extravagant and artistic meals in the golden age?
Omg! I’m so early
Who downvotes Mrs Crocombe???
What is marmalade made of?
Can somebody explain to me where did they take the ice from? Like, they couldn't make it so I guess they would but it? Where from? And how would it be transported?
Water ice? Oh Britain...
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!!!!
😀
how do you eat it? is it like icecream?
Sub 2 pewds
I'm obsessed with this show!!! However, what is the purpose of "water ice?" And how do you go about using it? Just start hacking away at it and eat it straight or do you drop it in water or juice?? It's basically just a fancy block of ice right? Sorry for my ignorance!
Me watching in confusion: I don't get it, what common food is- ohhh.. she made a popsicle..
Lol.....a Victorian person talking about hygiene.....funny.
Why not put it in the fridge, where you froze the ice in the first place?
A.k.a Slushies, and ew marmalade is gross.
I saw the English Heritage interview with this actress so I know she's British, but why does she not sound British to me much of the time? Does she have a regional accent I'm not familiar with? I'm hearing lots of hard R's where I normally don't hear them in British accents.
Can't y'all pack some different music please for a change?
I want Netflix series about this woman, her maids, gardeners, people from the stables, Lord and Lady  Braybrooke, their friends...would watch!
Shit's so british it colonized my computer.
1:38 
so we all gonna ignore this little laugh?
She looked straight at the camera when she said cheapen it

Never have I felt so attacked HAHAHA
“I wouldn’t want to ... cheapen it.”

I love her!
Mrs. Crocombe and Jon Townsend  are always such a delight to watch. They warm my heart on such a cold day ❤️
Mrs Crocombe vs Gordon Ramsay?
"I wouldn't want to cheapen it..."  I suspect Mrs Crocombe is a saucy minx after a few brandies!
This looks delicious. It reminds me of Panna cotta 🤤
The pudding mold is very beautiful.
Mrs. Crocombe never throw shades. She throw the whole tree! Lol 😁 I love her ❤
I always wonder what the real Mrs. Crocombe would say if she saw how people all over the world were absolutely fascinated with her~ ^.^
The grocer had no what, you say? Why, ahem why the nerve! We shall have words! Words, I say. Well, right after we have this wonderful custard. Oh heavens, that is delicious. Delicious, I say.
Someone needs to make a period romantic comedy with this amazing woman immediately. Preferably one where no less than two dozen men (one of whom must be Colin Firth, its the law) brutally give each other snarky comments in an effort to win her heart.
(*leans forward and buries face in pudding*) 😋
This is the culture i want to see from England
I've never seen a custard pudding in my life and now I want one :/
I feel like this is the side of YouTube my grandma watches + cat videos.
I wouldn't want to be the shop keeper who had to tell her they were out of isinglass!
Can you please show how you cut and serve after making. Very intriguing
They're Taking the Hobbits to isinglass! 

For some reason this is all i can hear now after he said she normally uses isinglass....
This episode is more "acoustic" as the jingle is sometimes paused. I liked hearing the sound of brass enamel bowls.
I'd love to see a Victorian meal with Lord and Lady Braybrook eating what Mrs. Crocombe has prepared
Aww I was really hoping she was going to cut into it.
外国のおとぎ話に出てきそうな方だなぁ…とっても素敵です
日本語字幕ついてる！！！😂💗
I would cry if that didn't come out kd the mold perfectly!  That looks delicious :)
That looks really yummy and thanks to the mold really fancy - I want a mold like this...
3:36 "Ooouh, Verry Good!" I am definitely saying this next time I'm licking batter 👌❤️
Oh my God, my grandma had that pudding mold! How I miss her now. 😭
I wach this from Denmark and i just love it,love the british accent and the way you cook it’s amazing ❤️❤️
Omg thank you for a new video 🙏 these are all so beautifully made, I enjoy every second of it 💗
I laughed at the little snort Mrs. Crocombe did when saying that the Lord would eat custard in every course 😂
Also, the molds Mrs. Crocombe uses are all very beautiful 😍
That little giggle she does when talking about Lord Braybrook really showed how in character she is. Wonderful!
She's so endearing. I like how she speaks louder at some points and is kind of like a teacher.
What is, if my German ears hear that correctly, Eisenglas?
すごく可愛い動画ですね。
本当にお屋敷勤め？そういう設定でしょうか。
I just want to know who gets to eat it at the end.
I never knew how badly I needed custard pudding in my life, until this video. 😩😂
this is super similar to blancmange, another dish Victorians enjoyed, that has its roots in the 13th century. the version I make is with milk and flavored with rosewater but it's good with almond extract as well, or hommade almond milk and cinnamon.
I felt such satisfaction when the custard slipped out of the mould.
"I'm only going to use a little orange flower water. And I wouldn't want to... cheapen it." 😂
That pudding looks absolutely gorgeous, that mold is so beautiful. You did such an amazing job and I bet it tastes fabulous!
finally！ l've been really looking forward for your Victorian custard recipe
Now imagine adding a bit of sweetner to the gelatin (to make it more of a dessert) and making that jam into a gelatin-based mirror glaze to pour over the custard. You'd have a beautiful, gothic-esque dessert.
WELCOME BACK, MRS CROCOMBE!!! I literally squealed with joy when I saw a fresh, new video was posted! <3
THE QUEEN MRS CROCOMBE IS BACK AND SHES SNATCHING OUR WIGS WITH HER CUSTARD 🙌😩👌❤️
why does she always pronounce it aRmond instead of aLmond
Its like LARGE PANNA COTTA
Deliciously delicious 😋❤
Pouring the custard in , is relaxing ( Asmr)😴😴❤
Me: Can we get something to eat?

My mom: we have food at the house

Me:
"I WOULDN'T WANT TO CHEAPEN IT"
When you have to get ready for work, but decide to risk being late because of this upload right here. I won't risk being late for any other Youtube video!
MY QUEEN HAS RETURNED, HUZZAH 💜💜💜
I didn't know the Camera quality was so good back then 👌😍
Ears: blessed
Eyes: 20/20
Taste buds: snatched 
Weave: soaring
Oh my God I am absolutely in love with your kitchen ❤️
Aww I was really looking forward to seeing the pigeon feet stuck in the top. The presentation today is a bit of a let down.
I need like 10 more videos ASAP!  I’ve watched them all, and I find it sooo fascinating!
I love Mrs. Crocombe so much that my face hurts from smiling at this video.
If she cooked for me that would be a blessing🌈
Why does this cure my depression so efficiently ? Love it !
'I wouldn't want to cheapen it'
LEGENDARY
I noticed there’s no sugar in the pudding recipe. 🤔
That big copper mixing bowl is a thing of beauty!!! I would love to have one of those.
1:38 Mrs Crocombe's laugh is so adorable!
And now i've seen all of Mrs Crocombe videos in the span of, like, three hours.
I tried my best to save some for the future, but i felt it wasn't right to interrump her.
Send more pls
Love from Bali - indonesia. Cant wait for the next video. 😘
This looks delicious. Bucket list goal do a Mrs. Crocombe cosplay.
Wow! You all have outdone yourselves! Thank you for another Mrs. Crocombe video.
Finally!! New episode!! Have been waiting for so long 😍
Your videos are so pleasant & relaxing. While also being informative & historical. I love it. 😊😘🙌
So beautiful! I would love to try that! Thank you EH and Mrs. Crocombe!(Kathy) What a pleasant surprise no thanks to YouTube as they are not putting my notices on my tablet.😬 so glad I found you tho!😘🍀✌🍨🇬🇧
This was delightful and wholesome. Glad I found this channel. I'll be sure to share videos with my 11-year-old as part of his homeschooling :)
Obviously, this lady is NOT the dish washer of the house.
That's a LOT of messed up cooking bowls.
This really is the most utterly charming series I think I’ve ever seen! 💕
This down-to-earth lady is bringing the level of wholesomeness to another dimension of galaxy.
You can tell Mrs. Crocombe is not the one who does the dishes. :)
I really love hearing the intro/background music. So pleasant to the ears. Anyone knows the title of that? Thanks!
I love the way this lady talking, move, and cook.. Im from indonesia, i can speek english very well.. But i enjoy this chanel..
Thankyou..
I just love Mrs. Crocombe. She is perfection.
Gosh isn't Mrs. Crocombe on fire in this video ? :D
Delightful recipe still ! I'd love to try it with agar agar instead of gelatine. I'm pretty sure it would work wonderfully.
Thanks, as always, for this video ! :)
I’m obsessed with these videos 😭 MORE PLEASE
I'll watch this again & again! It's just soo... good. 💖
I've been watching these videos for a long time, but only today I noticed how the name of the place was written, I had just heard it as "Oddly End" and assumed it was some sort of English quirky name.
Thanks for subtitling in Spanish, I love your recipes and your program. I hope your videos will last longer, hugs from Argentina!!
What 2 monsters disliked Mrs. Crocombe's cooking?!
Hooray! Another video of Mrs Crocombe. Thank you, English Heritage.
Yes! Best YouTube show EVER! More! More!
That looks so good 😍
And can you please show the ice box of Audley End house and what's inside of it?  Please...
Oh the giggle before commenting on lord Braybrook’s love of custard 🥰
Ooh! An hour ago and 12k view! Let me watch this before work.
Miss Crocombe is the Aunt you'd be scared of when your younger XD
But really love and enjoy as you get older.
The only cooking show where the finished products are not being tasted. 😅

Please, show the upstairs people eating the cooked meals. 😍
Absolutely obsessed with Mrs. Crocombe!!
I really love the mould used for this! Is there anywhere we may be able to purchase such a mould?
That custard bowl!! 😟😪😭🌹❤️❤️
2 seconds into the video thumbs it up instantly... Hi Mrs. Crocombe gurl!
Thank you for this I always look forward to your recipe's and i promise myself I will make some of them this coming year😊💕
I hope these videos never end! I could watch these 24 hours a day!
Am I the only one to think she somehow resembles Rowan Atkinson ?? (o////o) Mr.Bean? Anyone?
This looks good, and it would be the perfect kind of desert to have after a good dinner. Keep 'em coming English heritage! Always excited for the next recipe! ;)
Please make a chapter introducing Lord and Lady  Braybrooke!!!!
I honestly kinda miss the clock sign, the timer showing us how long a dish should be left cooking inside the oven/icebox/steamer
I'm soo happy this series is still going.

I can easily share with my mother, and we spend time watching it while i translate for her, since we are italian.

Thank you soo much
Türkçe yok altyazıda 🤦🏻‍♀️
Absolutely adore! What a great way to start off a Saturday morning 😊
Video bom so poderia ter tradução
This was beautiful!
I always click on these videos so fast! I love English Heritage and Mrs. Crocombe! Thank you for the videos!
I’m sick and mrs. Crocombe always makes me happy 
Ps she has the best pancake recipe love you mrs. Crocombe!!!💕
I love the way this lady speaks. Greetings from Argentina 🇦🇷
You should put all these lovely recipes, history and pictures of this gorgeous property, the gardens, kitchen and of course Mrs. Crocombe in a beautiful hard back book and SELL IT to all of us!
Im Puerto Rican descendant, Born in NY, raised un Miami, how I got this Lady do not know, BUT LOVE HER, her RECIPE AND HER COSTUME DRESS, THANK UUUUU SO MUCH
4:30 oh damn Mrs crocombe is getting GOURMET up in here
That is beautiful. My mom used to have molds like that.
Mrs. Crocombe you Saucy Minx you've done it again!
Love u so much I'm glad u are on YouTube your the best
oh I just get so much joy from watching her and I feel like I've learned quite about 18th century lifestyle
Yay!  A post from the Audley End kitchen!   Thanks for making my day!  I love the historical bits that go with it.  I could watch these every day!
Wow that is just beautiful! nice job Mrs. Crocombe.
“I wouldn’t want to...cheapen it...”

OhHhh SnAp
Watching her reminds me of Black Butler XD the Lady version of Sebastian perhaps?
the random giggle at 1:38? lol
Led to this from Li Zi Qi's videos.It is good to learn other cultures other than my race (Chinese). 
Gotta put her on my subscription list XD
I will dream of having a bite of this for dessert in my dreams ❤
Nobody is talking about her not cutting the putting... We all have missed the satisfaction 😄🤷🏼‍♂️
NEVER CLICKED SO FAST!! And Jeffree Star just uploaded too! 💕😂
Oh, wow)) So amazing channel, you are so amazing, and so amazing dishes!!) 😄
those 118 dislikes must be salty because they haven't tasted Mrs. Crocombe's cooking yet
Victorian bae! ❤
"For this recipe, you will need [...] ..egg yolks.."
editor marks out the egg whites
I just love the aesthetics! Keeps me wanting to watch for more!
'tis the merriest of days, for EH has bestowed upon us the blessing of an Avis video. That mold is as magnificent as our goddess Crocombe herself.
I LOVE Mrs. Crocombe.  This looks beautiful 💟
*screams in the Queen's English*
Thank you so much for these videos, wonderful stress management! I hope Mrs. Crocombe keeps recording them forever ❤️
Linda apresentação do prato e parece delicioso!
that chuckle at 1:39 is priceless
I love love LOVE these videos but I wish we could also see her plate up slices of the food so we could see more of the interior/consistency! Ever since the turbot episode I've been wondering how the Victorians actually served up any of these gorgeous foods!
Instructions unclear commited scooter ankle
Best way to start March!
Mrs. Crococombe, what would you advise I can use as a substitute for the gelatine? Love your cooking!
Posted 6 hours ago?? How did I missed the notification 🙀
I just wanna thank everybody involved in making these videos. It's really a blessing to be able to watch such delightful content on the internet by the end of the day. This recipe looks absolutely delicious, btw. And that mold looks stunning, almost like something you would see in Beauty and the Beast. Another wonderful episode. Great job!
Great video, that custard looked amazing!❤️😃
Yay! Another cooking video :D
1:39 wait until Lord Braybrooke discovers fish fingers
These videos are quite entertaining, thanks for putting them on.  I'm just wondering if Mrs. Crocombe also cooks for the servants or if one of her maids does it?
Another Mrs Crocombe masterpiece!
Was gonna try and make it but u lost me at   orange flower water🤣🤣
OMG...that sounds so yummy just hearing the ingredients !  It looks like marble, it's so perfect!!  Wow.  I can't wait to try this..all those luscious ingredients, I bet it's wonderful.  Yum city!!  Thank you for sharing with all of this, I love this program!!  XOXOX
NEW MRS. CROCOMBE VIDEO
Stops everthing I'm doing and watches


God, I truely missed her.
How come no one’s talking about how there’s no sugar in this??
I like how she tells her kitchen maids to keep recipe notebooks of their own. A young maid would be lucky to have her for a boss.
Actually one of my favorite desserts! Loved to learn this, thank you so much!
it’s really always a good morning when English heritage posts more Mrs. Crocombe
There's no sugar, but there is orange flower water. I can't tell if it's meant to be sweet or savory.
I was in the process of watching another video but accidentally pressed 'Subscriptions' and once I saw this, I'm pretty sure I broke my thumb clicking it to watch hahaha
Mrs Crocombe, please teach us more savoury recipes. I tried the rhubarb soup and it was wonderful.
I love that this is made in such a good ASMR manner. The sounds of the pouring cream and whisking and pots are soooo satisfying.
I tried to make this with my grandparents but it ended up looking like half an egg. Tasted okay though
Yay! Another recipe with Mrs. Crocombe. ♥️
Mrs. Crocombe's videos always make my day! Thank you!
Mrs. Crocombe is such a delight to watch 😊
I wd venture to say, that most of us hold Mrs.Hippersen/Crocombe in our mind as beautiful and satisfying as that ivory custard she just prepared. Great day, who is permitted to eat her dishes? Lucky ones, I believe.
“i hope it works”
ingredients is gelatine 
what if it doesn’t work
Mrs Crocombe and her professionalism  for Master Chef Professional!
Surely it would have contained a little sugar?  Most recipes I have seen do.  Love this series.
The mold is absolutely stunning
Omg Mrs Crocombe doing swirls on the side of the plate I thought she was being a precursor for Nouvelle Cuisine!!!
1:56 is there an entire egg yolk left and forgotten in that bowl? or is it just the light/weird shade? lol
Omg she's back it again! Another delicious and scrumptious recipe! Thank you Mrs Crocombe and English heritage 😊❤
I didn't notice it on my first watch but on my second play through I immediately saw she missed an egg and it was still in the bowl.
👍I really like this recipe because it doesn't involve the baking in a water bath. This seems much easier for modern day. I think I'll add this to my "cooking book" also.😉😁
I just stop watching these videos.....there....just.....so.....BEAUTIFUL!
3:36 - 3:39

Uuuu very good

Meme material :)))
So except for the blackcurrant jam sauce, there's no sugar added to this? Sweet! Pun not intended. ;-D
Who would ever dislike this video??? 
Mrs Crocombe is awesome 😍👌
Don't know how I got here......but interesting!
Keto custard!
美しい
美術館の作品みたい
That pudding looks very good.  Nice to see you again Mrs Crocombe. 😊
"I wouldn't want to cheapen it"
That's my new life motto ☺️
Gorgeous,  and just as delicious I'm sure!
Oh, Mrs. Crocombe...  Ever the arch gastronome.  Thank you for providing us a muse.
Ha Ha Ha!!!
Lord Braybrook would eat it with everything. 555 ^^
NASA reports evidence of powdered wigs landing on Mars
All these videos are me cooking after Brexit.
WE NEED A MRS CROCOMBE NETFLIX SHOW! SHE'S TOO ICONIC NOT TO!
That giggle at 1:38 though 😂
Orange flower water can be gotten at bartending supply shops
YAS! The Victorian Cooking Queen is BACK!!! XD
1:38 be like the subtle ʰᵉʰᵉ in any given conversation
3:37 OOOHHH VERRYYYYY GOOOOODDDD
I wish you cut that custard, would have loved to see the texture
From us of the Spn Fam on tumblr, we highly enjoy these videos and their accuracy.
I'd love to see the bloopers for this
The gloomy day just brightened when I saw there was a new Mrs Crocombe video available! Long live the memory & spirit of Avis Crocombe (and the brilliant Kathy Hipperson who portrays her)!
rather than the recipe...I'm a big fan of the mould :-D !!!
Thank you, English Heritage, for making more of these <3 Please never stop!
Cool but who's cleaning all them dishes 😭😂😂
There is something very satisfying about your videos, it's either your great reenactment while cooking or it's your impressive cleavage. I'm torn between the two
We all love him she.s the best cooking in the world 😊
English culture and history are so amazing
These videos soothe my mind in a way that nothing else can…
Even though I will never make this, I thoroughly enjoy watching these videos 👍
a r m o n d   o u i l
What is orange flower water and I never saw gelatin in sheets, only in packages.  Also this pudding isn't sweet probably.
I love how she say cheaper it xD cute mold!
Honestly, I would like to see Gordon Ramsey and Mrs Crocombe go head to head. Who do you think would win?
"I think he could eat it with everything"

Fishfingers?
38 dont like custard pudding?! 😱
The pudding shape with the rose looks really good!😊
You're insanely hot. Love from America.
So beautifully presented 😍
What a lovely reciepe🌷😍I will defenitely try it out!
If you are worried about it curdling whilst heating on direct heat... use a double boiler instead. ❤🌅🌵
I love this but.......... DID YOU SEE THE EXCESS CREAM?? LIKE WHYYYY!!!
I will try this one. Thank you Mrs Crocombe
Excellent production quality as always!
1:39 was that Victorian laughter?
Wow. Coolest cooking channel I have found in a longtime
Tried making this at home and it was very good. It's not sweet on its own but with the sauce it is delightful.  Will be making again and greasing my mould a little bit better.  :-)
Does anyone try Mrs. Crocombe's recipes?
Such a good video. Like always.
That kitchen is my dream good gravy. 😍
my OCD is attacking me cus of her apron 😭
It's always a pleasure to see Mrs. Crocombe, she needs a weekly t.v show 💜💜
This is amazing. I am sure this tastes wonderful as well.
That's quite a fancy mould. The custard looks like marble. Very lovely
You have no idea how happy I get when I see a new Mrs Crocombe video 🥰🥰
I was dying for a new video 😭 I'm so happy 💕
Always love these videos! Thank you.
There's no sugar in the custard??
It is always the greatest pleasure to see Mrs Crocombe. These videos are like a journey to the past, I love it.
That mold is so pretty!
It looks like porcelain, very well done.  It's beautiful,  so lovely I wouldn't want to eat it.  I love these videos!
I wonder if this is a kink, also LMAO ASMR. This was pretty cool tbh
Not many people live there,huh? I juz thought that bcuz of the echoes i hear when Mrs. Crocombe talk
I LOVE that custard dish!  Beautiful work Mrs Crocumbe :)
i live for these series
Maybe an odd question, but it looks like more stuck to the bowls/ pots than would happen today now that we have silicone spatulas, and electric mixers would produce a different result than a whisk, cream is different. How different are the recipes when they’re made today due to small factors like this? 
Just started watching these videos, I love them!
Hi guys , your videos is awesome ! Let me give suggest to use properly microphone to avoid eco. Thank you !
Minecraft Roleplay 18+
The content is heaven for me.
I'd have to add sugar to mine.
Ohmygod i have never felt this uncomfortable in my life
I love these videos! But I’d really like to see a blooper reel, of Mrs. Crocombe spilling the cream or missing the custard mold a bit, and then saying things like “drat!” And “oh fiddlesticks!” And other old fashioned exclamations.
4:02 When she demolded the custard, I was like, “YAAASSSS!” lol
Why not use a double boiler for the heating?  Wouldn't that be prevent curdling?
Mrs. Crocombe never fails to make my day!
Looks so tasty😍😍
Nothing makes me happier than a new video with Mrs Crocombe!! Thank you!!
A pleasure As always. Blessings Mrs. C. 👋
I get anxiety when the bowls aren’t scraped 😫
Merci d'avoir mis la recette en français 😘
3:35 is a reference to an actual journal entry from Mrs. Crocombe's recipe book. I love this series so much.
The Victorian way, awesome 💖💖
How many grams is the gelatin when using powder.
The queen is baccckkkk!
Someone different edited the video or they have different cameras or sound system.
This video is so british a cup of tea appeared in my hand
Why you guys put so much production value into everything except the sound 🤦‍♀️
Ty yet again for another scrumptious recipe💓❤ and btw...im part Brit and will be serving this to my family
I wonder what the actual Mrs. Crocombe would have thought of how popular her and her recipes are.
Thai Sub 👍🙂
มีซับไทยด้วย ☺
This is gorgeous! The mold really makes it stunning, though even without it I think that deep red sauce against the smooth white pudding would be eye-catching.
How i enjoy watching these videos when they pop up. So relaxing and interesting, i could easily watch this over and over.
Mrs. Crocombe vs. Gordon Ramsay
This gives me heavy shadowhunters vibes and I love that so much
I cant tell you enough how much I love this series!
Just like panna cotta really..
Good to see you again Mrs. Crocombe.  I would very much enjoy your custard pudding.   Tell me how do you keep your copper so bright?   Good day.
You can tell she’s not the one doing the dishes 😂
Good Evening, I enjoy your show. Could you updated your videos. Show more about that queen and her family's cooks. You should how they prepare food for them. I would like to see some of their way of cooking. Much to You show.😍💖💝👍💜.
I would love to see a play with Lord and Lady Braybrooke in it.
i love these videos  you are always so likeable and i love the way you explain things
Never clicked so fast~
This is amazing
But anyone notice that induction top????😂😂😂😂😂
I'm waiting... For more 'The Victorian Way' videos...  Let's negotiate, you give us one vid a week and we watch! Awe ty & see ya soon
Absolutely in love with accent 😍
I want that beautiful mold!  I noticed though, no sweetener in the custard?
Watching her cook is always the best! Wish they were a bit longer but nevertheless; absolutely amazing :)
A new video pleeeease! ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
Lovely custard mold but wouldn't destroy the lovely custard mold cause looks like a beautiful piece of Art.
Mrs. Crocombe always cheers me up when I'm having a tough day. I can always count on it. :)
It's such a great channel. It gives me everything I need to know about this cooking way during queen Victoria's reign,also know as the Victorian era. Ik love this channel. And honestly I'm glad I found this. It's very good.
watching ur videos is soooo relaxing.
They're taking the Hobbits to isinglass!
Are there any historical recipes from this period with chile pepper? Would be fun to see one.
Absolutely satisfying 😉
Wow! I Guess that‘s the Victorian Interpretation of italiano panna cotta! Lovely! 🍮
Now my day is complete :)
Ooo It looks so delicious! I wanna try this pudding!
Wonderfull  thanks  💜🌸💜🌸💜
That mold is love! The rose details are so beautiful!
憧れーーー！
I love orange flower water. I also enjoy rose water.
Ooh! It so pretty.
I can't imagine making this lovely recipe with isinglass.
Today's show is all about the ASMR!!! I love hearing the "thunk" when the bowl is put on the table and the scratching of the whisk. So good for the soul.
I think we can all agree that she better than us
Ive waited too long for this... Hahaha
I want merch that says "Don't Cheapen it" because I would 100% buy that lmao
That looked amazing. Such a beautiful mould. I would buy that if i saw it.
Everything looked normal and down to earth until she pulled a "Orange Flower Water"
Been waiting for this! ❤
I can't click fast enough! Yaaaay
Amazing, as always ❤❤❤
"I wouldn't want to cheapen it." QUEEEEEEEEEN
I really want to see her serve a full course meal to lord and lady braybrook
This gave me the Snape vibes ahah XD looks yummy, I might try to make it (once I figure out what orange flower water is....)
British baking show who ?!?! 😂
I would love to visit that castle, that is if they welcome tourists.  Be cool to meet her in person.
I love!!!!!
Oof so tragic I've never been able to try custard cause I'm allergic to eggs, rip lol
That's a gorgeous custard. I love it.
i need that pudding mold, its soooo beautiful
No one- hey 


Ms crombe- “I wouldn’t want to CHEAPEN it”
Still trying to figure out if it’s just a clever angle, or very deep irony.
That actually looked super good lol
From now on I will call the fridge "the ice box"
The mold that she use to her pudding it's giving it and.elegant vibe I want one of those 😂
Yay! Love these videos! It almost looks plastic when she takes it out of the mould
I need this pudding in my life.
OUR SHADY QUEEN YESSS
such a pretty mold! 🌹🌹🌹
Are these wrapping from ingredients originals or made especialy for the videos? Are they made acordind to original packages from those times? They absolutely perfect! -RI👨‍🍳
I love it! I'm going to do it!I love this kind of videos.History and gastronomy.😊😅
Never knew you could thicken a pudding with fish...? It is collagen, so basically gelatin, I guess.  I'd only heard it in reference to mica windows before.
Another FANTASTIC video!
These video's are so relaxing and educational. 😂👍
No sugar?!?
I find her VERY attractive.Especially in the vintage garb.❤💖💕💓
wow I want to try this
Why do I find this so hilarious 😂😂😂
Lovely! When I got here there were only 8 views and 1 comment. Never been so early. XD
That looks so delicious!!! I love that english accent!
It’s the first custard recipe I’ve seen that has no sugar
🌸 oh yeah 😋 .........to me this is heaven 💕💗💖✨
I was just wondering this morning if y’all was going to put another cooking clip up btw I love your custard mold.. with the 🌹 very pretty
I'd "hit" that - the custard, NOT Mrs. Crocombe.
Thank you so very much for bringing mrs.Crocombe back! I do so love her.
1:43 
Egg yolk: hey u forgot about me!
The lovely mold makes the custard pudding look simply exquisite.
Move over, Downtown Abbey. There's a new British drama in town and its name is Audley End House ♥️

I expect nothing less than Avis Crocombe as the female lead who navigates through the dramatics of both the nobility and the servants of the manor, with gardeners and stable boys courting with cooks and maids, tongue-in-cheek humour and subtle social commentary on the Victorian era.
Such a pretty looking custard pudding,feel like eating right away.But too bad i cant have it physically 😂😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤👌
It’s interesting that the recipe contains no sugar or other sweetener, except for the accompanying jam at the end. Quite different from the custards my mum made.
It always amazes me how much attention was placed into decoration and celebrating meals. Makes me want to come back in time. ;)
I clicked so fast after seeing this from my recommendations :D so happy!
this is way more relaxing than asmr tho.
Best cooking channel on youtube!
Yaaass!!! 😍
David Seymour REALLY needs to do some of these recipes by Mrs Crocombe I would pay anything to see it
where the heck am i gonna find orange flower water…
I need that in my belly immediately
I live for these videos, they are a true delight 💖
Im going to mail you all my scrapers for those bowls!  :)
I just love pudding recipes.
Did someone say CUSTARD!?!?!

No I don’t have a problem ( maybe)
How much powdered gelatin would equal a “sheet” of gelatin? I don’t think we can get it in sheets in the U.S.
It looks gorgeous and tasty, I wish I could have a bite 😋
1:38  oh do tell Mrs. Colcombe, you sassy gossip!!
Yummy! 😋😋 What a beautiful mold! 🌹 Thank you for sharing 💖🙋
3:38 can someone make this a GIF?
Love that i got to travel back into an era of rustic sophistication
3:08 oh my lords, i cannot.
If you left out the egg wouldn't this be panna cotta? 🤔
I'm here for her accent
Old sweets today sweets which is healthier?
Had to look up isinglass- sounds pretty similar to gelatin but made from fish
I was so waiting for her to dig in with a spoon and we get a look of the texture inside. That's the best part of cooking! You eat it!!
Food was authentic and real!! Its 0747am from my part of the world and I am watching this!! Luv it
I hit “like” before I even finish watching a Mrs. Crocombe video. 😄
I'm watching so many of these now lol
Welcome back Madam Crocombe!
It's always a good day when I get this notification!!
I only clicked this because I thought she was going to boil some calves feet or Pig hooves. I have never seen sheets of gelatin where I live in a large Metropolitan city in the u.s.
Im sorry but that thumbnail kills me 😂
Miss Crocombe, this custard looks delicious.
Mrs. Crocombe, the way that you so expertly cooks everything on this channel, you can’t ever tell that you don’t cook like this in your present, non-Mrs. Crocombe life.
Hooray!! Another amazing video with Mrs. Crocombe! I hope this means more will be coming as I remember in her interview it was mentioned that "as many as possible" are filmed in one day!
One big question,
Who is going to wash all those dishes?
Wow...that doesn't even look like food. It's so pretty!
I love the mold!!! This looks so yummy but I’d have to add a little sugar to mine.
They really did know how to put on a glorious show at table.  And this looks delicious.  I love you, English Heritage💙🇬🇧❤️
I would say no to a night out to binge watch mrs Crocombe anyday this is my PEAK weekend entertainment
I’m always so happy to receive a message from Ms Crocombe - thanks for another wonderful video 👍💖😀
yuum❤️❤️❤️
The mold is so beautiful. Where can I get it? 😭
i love these.  I won't lie, though, the music makes me think of the Sims a little.
Be my mother please lol
this should be a meme 3:37
Mrs Crocombe is back!!! What a great start into the weekend :)
That mold is gorgeous!
How is it so white, smooth & perfect? So lovely @.@
God I love this woman.
May I suggest that Mrs Crocombe make Yorkshire puddings next?
Wonderful. Was almond oil commonly used during the Victorian times?
looks good....i wish i could taste it.  i love this show.
Am i the only one who's stressing out bc of not  having complete ingredients to make this but has no intention of making?
Add come brandy.... As usual 😉
This better be in Pokemon Sword and Shield
Has anyone tried the recipe at home? Looks very mild.
She is soooo beautiful, cultured... Do people like this still live in this earth....
Oh that looks delicious!
these videos sometimes sound like they’re filmed in a dungeon
I usually make it the “Japanese way” 😊
That looks glorious !!!   :)
It certainly is pretty isn’t it
My mother and I love watching your videos!
PLEASE cut into the food you make
Where is the gelatin? I wonder😂
Why doesn't she just pour the whisked yolks into the cold cream and pour directly into the warm cream. She can save the servants to wash one more pot. 🤣
Had to turn my TV off to watch . I bet this is delicious .
And the Oscar goes to...Kathy Hipperson.
The jam is awakening my vampirism.
1:38 Mrs Crocombe laughed like uhm mhe,that choked me everytime i eat and watch her little laughing.
3:09 is the best line ever
Does using a copper bowl do anything special?
EAT THAT THING RIGHT KNOW IM FEELING BAD
This made my whole day better.
Looks so good!!!!
I'd be licking all the cream left on those pots •-•
Often there is more alcohol in his recipes. I think i would make only the Pancakes recipe :/
They're taking the hobbits to isinglass
It makes me so happy when I see one of these videos!! Thank you to everyone who works so hard on them for us, it's really appreciated!
"cheapen it"
1:37 that chuckle is friggin creepyyyy
Idk about yall... but I'd smash the birkenstocks off Ms.Crocombe... she sexy frfr...
3:30 - 40
Its beautiful!
Cus I go orange blossom water in the cupboard.
Ms. Crocombre is looking thick
I would have liked to see you cut into it and serve it up, to show what the inside was like.
They're taking the hobbits to Isinglass
This looks so good🤤💚 i might try it once
"Shall we add the feet?"
At about 32 sec she says "I usually make it with......but the grocer didn't have any"
I don't understand the word she says, can anyone help. 
I'm just interested in knowing what she usually uses. Thanks
Do I skip the Brandy. Because we don't use it. Is it compulsory.
I don't cook but this is my first video of the day.
The food looks tasty but I am drawn to the utensils, pots, pans, plates and the molds, especially the one used here!
I'm not even english, but i totally adore this videos...
How come no one has commented on this video yet, also the pudding looks divine!
Please cut into it pleaseeeeee😢
3:23 The sound of the liquide mixture pooling inside of the mold is like music to my ears 💜
Somehow , your face look like the school principle from matilda to me. But the opposite
I love the mold!!!! And this show
Awe, Mrs Crocombe is so adorable, really cool video as well, so authentic!
"I wouldn't want to cheapen it"... Wow...
This looks amazing!
Wait does she actually live there
I love these and idk why... Lol
I don't see any sugar in this recipe...
I need to visit this place before I die 😂
3:35 - 3:38 that should be a meme
Assisto por puro prazer!
I wouldn’t want to...
I wonder how they would have made this before modern refrigeration.
Absolutely love this series!
The number of utensils she used☹️
How would one go about making orange flower water?
I want Ramsey to react to this
English people DO fancy brandy，don’t you?
Thank God there were no pigeon feet involved this time.
I needed this ❤
I wish she had cut into it and tasted it.
I wasn't aware isinglass could be used to thicken puddings..
I don't see her put the gelatine?
Ye old jello brand is shooketh
u get the notification, u like it bfr watching!! i lov her
beautiful!
Our Queen is back to grace us with the content we crave. She's the hero we never knew we needed
Could you use a jello mold for this?
Always been waiting for new episodes.
Are you typhoid Mary?
This is legitimately terrifying.
泡立て器kawaii♡
You do your thang, Mrs. C.
YOU’RE BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Hope Mrs. Crocombe does t mind if I use one of her recipes
You know it's going to be a good recipe when it comes from Mrs. Crocombe. She makes everything she cooks seem so gourmet.
Yeah I have some orange flower water just laying around.
I missed the gelatine
Wait...there was no sugar added.
Uff, this is calming me down so much
she spent so much time making it look posh that she forgot to add any sugar to it
I thought she would paint the rose with that jam!
I love these recipes!
I wish someone would make a meme out of this like the pictures from “hide the pain Harold” it would be so funny!!! And I’m not making fun of her it is quite astonishing that she is a very good cook.. I love it!! ❤️
This recipe is no yolk!
I miss these videos so much! Just last week I re-watched the entire series.
As soon as I saw the video on my news feed I had to open it! Love miss Crocombe!
It looks so pretty
you know the feeling that you want to make something like that but you realize you were lack of equipment so you just watch her make it and hoping that someday you will make one of her cookings

sorry for my bad English
Plastic mold and plate in the 1800?
Looks absolutely delicious.
This is my type of aesthetic
Make me feel like she is making magic potion, not cooking food
Beautiful and elegant
No sugar??
What is the ingredient you needed instead of gelatin?
What!! No suet. She uses suet in everything. Lol
美味しそう！頑張って作ってみようかな☺🍴
That looks delicious ^_^
👍👌👏yummy
India
I'm literally drooling lol
A sweetened version would be a blancmange.
This looks easy enough.  I'm going to put little paper tops tied on top of my spice jars like hers.
So this is what its called!! My mom makes this sometimes but I never knew what it was bc she calls it "gelatina" and plus I never see her making it since I'm always at school lmao
Can I substitute the orange flower water with anything else? I don't think we have that anywhere in our country and I'd love to try this. Can I use Vanilla instead?
Ms Crocombe is a queen
The victorians added brandy to everything lol
They should have a mukbong
She is like bob ross of baking
3:29 ,, somebody needs to make a ytp out of this
No sugar??
Are there any more updates on if and potentially when you may be releasing a copy of Mrs Crocombe's cookbook? i would love to get my hands on one when possible.
What can the brandy be substituted with? I am a non alcoholic.
Mrs Crocombe, Queen of the gays!
No sugar? No sweetener?
Oh man, that turned out amazing, seems criminal I can’t taste it through my phone, I wonder how far that development is off
3:37 please someone make a meme out of this please
Awww..I wanted to see her cut into it :(
Beautiful pudding and presentation!
オレンジフラワー水…
When she was doing this, i probably was in school dying.
love those bottles!!!
This is so beautiful
She always reminds me of amy from the big bang theory
It's a bit like panna cotta, no?
Mrs. Crocombe, you have a beautiful custard mold. Always a joy to see you give us a glimpse into your kitchen.
"the Victorian way" -adds gelatin which was invented in 1845
やったー日本語だっ
SLAYY QUEEN
I just love how classy yet sassy she is!! 😂
Wow...I thought the thumbnail was a picture that was drawn as an artists' interpretation of victorian cookery, but the entire recipe is made accurately? With that accurately dressed, pleasant and skilled woman giving the instructions? I seriously thought that the thumbnail was a downloaded pic, and the video is gonna show a standard, modern recipe. Boy am I glad I clicked this video, it was awesome!
Looks amazing and delicious!! I would love to find a mold like that.
Make it a meme ! 3:36
loving the whisk!
looked like induction cooker to me.Correct me if Im wrong.
I need try this :(
Wonder how it tastes with no sugar in it 🤭
Sugar free, apparently
3:37 <3
There’s just something about her voice. These videos make me feel safe <3
I just found this channel today and I'm in love with this woman! I did have a bunch of shit to do today.. Guess I'll be doing all that shit tomorrow. Excuse me while I binge now.
It looks good❤️❤️
Hi...is your stove Victorian era?
Love love these. Should be more ☹️
Kayano Kaede would love this
The color on that is beautiful!
Didn't realise the mould had a rose design at the bottom and when the custard pudding was flipped I was surprised and it looks pretty!
I'd love to try this pretty simple dessert one day and wonder if I'd be allowed to not use brandy and orange water but to instead just use vanilla perhaps...:'D
I wish she would eat it! It would be so satisfying to watch her dig in to some of these
I feel like this recipe would be improved with the addition of pigeon feet.
I love pudding but I love her the most, personalities and charecter voice she so coolll.
0:55 wheres sugar?!😕
Love this channel!
Her accent is so beautiful...
Looks like a scene from Pride and the prejudice. The accent is so attractive
I want that mold!
How about another video with Edgar Ashman?
things i watch at 3 am
"Ooh, very good."
3:36 sluuuurp “Noice.”
I really love house with so much history, like old mansion like this one.
Is ms crocombe going to be in Pokemon Sword and Shield
shes so lovely i want her to tuck me into bed and read me food recipes until i fall asleep
3:37 could honestly be a meme
Now i know why Mrs Crocombe didnt use sugar on her pudding. It’ll be oversweet if it paired with blackberry jam. Such a talented chef!
I wonder what orange flower water smells and tastes like
What a delightful mould!  Where can we find those now?
When was gelatin invented?
Did she just giggled at 5:11?
I’d have to put sugar in it. She know she didn’t taste nun when she tasted it 😂 but I love these vids
I used to love this before I worked in a restaurant, and now watching this is so difficult because it doesn't seem as realistic anymore.


The amount of pans she uses, the way she struggles to pain the plate with the sauce; the real Mrs Crocombe would have been much more efficient in the kitchen; especially considering the times.
It would be very cool if they used music inspired from that era.
Anyone else noticed she missed a yolk? :(
Made my day
There youtube, I watched it. Now leave me alone.
I adore Mrs Crocombe though lets face it she is no Ruth Mott
We need more videos!!!!
Damn I know I’m making it!
Wait... no sugar?
It's such a delight to have Mrs. Crocombe cook and prepare such delights for our viewing and learning pleasure!
Strange that there wasn't any sugar in this recipe.
That wooden whisk 💕
Oh how I miss Mrs Patmore...
can the creme be substituted with milk?
Mrs.Crocombe is so precious omg
@emmymadeinjapan
why is the audio like that
this was delighful to watch
OH HEAVILY 😋
I never tasted custard pudding. I wonder how it tastes like.. :3
strange, is there no a gramm of suger in it?
Thanks for sharing.
I love the result and its fancy and looks mouthwatering
I love these cooking videos!
What do Lord and Lady Braybrooke do if a recipe gets messed up, or they don’t like what you cook?
Love this show
Now if we could just get her to eat the creations at the end ☺️ that would be so satisfying
Did I miss something or was the only sweetener the Jam?
this is the first time ive watched one of these and genuinely what the hell
Love the accent
I wish they would show her or someone tasting it and describing the taste!
Does this not require sugar?
I LOVE these videos!
First thing I noticed was No added sugar. I think people today would expect this to be sweet. At least my fellow Americans.
That custard is THICC
the refrigerator left the group
So many unnecessary bowls to clean.
It's good but, wouldn't it be a bit sweet of you just add a bit of sugar?
Is that not just ice cream
No sugar added?
Love watching Mrs. Crocombe demonstrate her recipes, so interesting to learn about real English food! I'm from the USA and I probably know less about traditional English dishes than any other country's food.
so...no sugar??
I want to try it. Any dessert is worth to try (but not those with raisins for I prefer without)
Ooooh very good 🤣😂🤣😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
Recipe of Sponge Biscuits please!! 英語合ってるか分かんないけど！お願いします！m(_ _)m
1:39 Lord braybrook would eat it with everything. Would he even eat it with lady braybrook's................uhh.......ok let's not venture there......
Sounds yummy and even though I sweeten everything to hell, I would love to try this version! Especially if I had a mould like this, it makes the end result look like edible porcelain. How pretty!
The single cream is sweetened ?
yey mrs crocombe is back!
I live for these videos
1:38 That sound
That looks good
"OOHH VERU GOOD" HAHAHAHAHAHA
1:38 that giggle made me laugh 😆
I love this so much
Gordon Ramsay: The custards rawwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's too pretty to eat
I wish we could have seen her cut into it :( lol
Dang, I want some.
A sugar free Blancmange. Interesting as a second course.
I love this Channel!!
One egg yolk was left behind !!
I’m making this for my next vampire kick back.
so much better than PornHub
I love these videos so much! :D
How pretty!
I love how everyone is saying "OMG THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS" to what is basically cream jelly with egg yolks whisked into them.
something is off in this video , its not as good as usual ... weird
Gordon Ramsey has entered the chat
Is it just me or Mrs. Crocombe just became a tad bit sassy. 😁
i secretly always wonder what she would look like sans her garb.
Im here for the accent
Easy to do, cheap and delicious. Thanks very much for you to teach us.
Amazing!!
This is really lovely. I’m going to get myself a pretty mold and make this. So much nicer than just putting it into ramekins and not any more work. Does anyone know how much 5 sheets of gelatin would translate into little packs?🤔. I’m unfamiliar with those.
Is Carnival???😮
TEA TIME PLEASE ❤️
Girl, you wearing a new face cream or something?? You’re skin looks great in this video.
OOO MRS CROCOMBE WHATS THE TEA WITH ORANGE FLOWER WATER SPILL IT SIS
Ooooh ~~~ very good!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Right now I’m eating custard pudding❤️
That looks so expensive.
And again I still don’t know why I got this in my recomandation videos
When was the gelatine added?
これはどこの国だが？もしかして、遠い遠いえげれすってとこだったら、おら感動しちゃうっぺよ
she's so soothing love it :))
I want this woman to be my grandma but im sure she would strongly dissaprove of many of my life decisions
That mold tho
0:31 isengard?
No one wants cheap custard pudding. But maybe that's why the cream is single.
I wanna know what kind of drugs she takes before filming these
Seems delicious!
Beautiful 😍
That carving looks tasty
Just like the 90s :)
1:37 - 1:40 That laugh 😂
That's a big pudding
Simply lovely
i cant use brandy, what should i do?
3:36 “Ooh very good” 😂
the intro looks like cgi wtf
Why does it look like she stuffed her bra with tissues hahahahaha 😂😂
Umm what is orange flower water?? And is blackcurents black berries?? I'm so confused lol
Just like someone comented before i didn't see any sugar used in this recipe.... can sugar be added??
브랜디 맨날 들어가네용...
That looks so delicious 😋
I'm coming to visit next year.
Thats probably the only thing id want to eat out of everything xD
Wonderful pudin Lady
So... where do u get orange flower water?....
Cut into itttt
I like the mould.
3:35  You’re Welcome
💛💛💛
That “ooh very good” at 3:37 NEEDS to be meme’d
3:35 me when i see the neighbor who's been parking where my trash cans are supposed to go crying on his front lawn because his wife has requested a divorce
No sugar?
No sugar ? 😰
No sugar?
No sugar?
She is awesome :)
1:38 what the heck was that sound xDDD
No sugar?
I love custard so much
I would like to see what that "ice box" looks like !
dowtown abbey
So it's a panna cotta but fancier
Doesnt it looked like tofu
Is that the Pemberley estate?
This is so cheesy...but i like it
what’s orange flower water?
I really really like this channel
i want ❤️
No sugar?
So what would this taste like? The custard didn't have salt or sugar so I'm thinking the Brandy and orange flower water take over. I haven't tried either of those so I have no idea.
I don't think they had gelatin back then at all I think they used fat or something
Looks absolutely lovely, but no sugar at all..?
💕💕💕
i love armand oil
3:36 was great
Why do I feel like she’s filming in a large hollow space? All echo-y but nevertheless, paused whatever I was doing and watched this!
AHHHHHHH YOU'RE BACKKKK
That courgette tho
This looks delicious!
Just wow....
Shape!
오랜만에 요리영상이라니.. 너무 좋아요 기다렸어요!! :>
it's so english
No sugar or honey?
No sugar at all in the custard?
Yum custard pudding!!
Is it sweet?
When was the gelatine used?
No sugar?
Almost too pretty to eat, so glad I only had small ramekins. I used honey and cinnamon. I wanted to try with apricots.
Is it just me or is mrs crocombe hidin some junk in that trunk
今でもこんな感じの服装とか街があるのですか??
1:39 omg that little chuckle i love u
Yyasss
Jolly good pip pip tallyhoe
But where is he sugar?
It looks Nice, but since it doesn't have any sugar, and only sweetness is from the small amount of black currant jam, I would think it would taste like plain, sugar free, room temp yogurt. 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️
Love these cooking videos.
I wish she had cut into it.
armond oil
What's it with Brandy in everything
Looks delicious!
Wait... Where's the gelatin part??
I just want to come her kitchen😂
Great desert and corset
(2019 hd)
could you substitute rose water instead of orange flower water?
IT'S RAWW
No sugar?
Play it at 1.5x
Im lost in internet
3:36 Ooh, very good!
Shister snapped🤪
I love white culture
Mrs. Crocombe, I have some questions for you. How much brandy do you use in this receipts? And what can I substitute with for the brandy??? I would like to make it for todays dinner. Thank you.
Victorian!
Too short 😭
The face she does at me at 2:16
It's very pale
When you want to make these but you DONT know where to get the ingridients couse your a normal person and a kid....;-;
Так красиво, жаль нет русских субтитров. Очень приятно на вас смотреть.
Looks so good.
Oh thank god ! Another video , now I've got the reason to live more
Those estate grounds look familiar. Did they film Pride and Prejudice there?
3:35 the real shit happens here
เกลียดหน้าป้าจัง
Was there no sugar added for sweetness?
컨셉 보소 ㅋㅋㅋ
🤩
1:38 that small chuckle makes me smile :)
조아
Whot? No Pfudding?!
You cant have,that without the,sugar!
Are you real? Haha
Where's the sugar?
geeeeze that looks delicious! I want to eat 5 of those. whole.
Will agar agar and lactose free alterantives work because of dietary constraints
Marry me!  :o
Can we just talk for a minute about the laugh at 1:38?
Slop cook.
victorian asmr sure sounds nice
That is beautiful.
Indeed.
No eyeballs?
The mold looks fancy
Can u please have a bite at the end?
1:39 she sounded like a towel cleaning the window.
1:38 cheeky Mrs Crocombe!
No sugar !?
I love her so much
Looks OK but would be tops with pigeon feet sticking out of it
I feel poor for some reason.
This lady needs to get an acting job in the movies, she does a good job playing this character
This pudding look like tofu
I hate how she poured the warm cream into the cold cream and then into a new pan, like girl just pour it into the warm cream in the already warm pan.


There was no way they were using that many bowls and pans to make a custard back then when they didn't have running water to clean all the dishes, now come on be more realistic; you're supposed to be historically accurate!
Common custard of Japan. The little thieves of China.
Anyone have a vegan version of this recipe?😊😊
왜 한국어 자막은 없는거람!퓨ㅠㅠ
Aren’t we in 2019?
Very pretty
What a queen
Pretty custard. :)
That looks yummy
uhhh can they please do a victorian style mukbang with like a typical victorian tea or supper?
I like to watch your video
Custard without Sugar
Mettete i sottotitoli in italiano , per favore
Very pretty too.
It looks lovely!
i want to eat THAT
What is orange flower water? I have never heard of that. That looked to good to eat.
What if we don't use egg... M a vegetarian...
0:14
Isn't it basically panna cotta?
My custard pudding without sugar
No sugar? That's why no one like British food.
"Ooh. Very good."
There was a whole egg yolk left behind!
Lovely 😍
Blackcurrants are illegal in the US
3:37
WOW.
3:36
I cant get enough of these episodes
Shame on the people who down voted this video!
what is orange flower water? or ginger wine
Love it when she pronounces her sssssss
3:36
this is cool
is it okay not to use brandy im muslim so i cant consume alcohol
그림의 떡
What does one put in the custard to make it sweet? Is it the orange flower water? I am not referring to the blackcurrant jam sauce here.
Where could I get a mold like that?
It's 6 AM & I'm extremely groggy
Sees a new Mrs. Crocombe video
I smiled & said to myself, "this takes priority" :)
I love these videos I’m going to make this tommorow! Thank you so much Mrs Crocumme
No gadjets in her kitchen
What a beatiful pud!
This video was 3:37
Her snort at 1:38 is funny haha
Victor pudding
Can present be like this victorian way things? I love it.
Very nice, as allways! But, I miss some sugar in this recipe?!
Is this for real
I was just thinking to myself how to make authentic English custard and then YouTube obliged once again
Wow!
I wish I knew what black current tastes like😭 I believe it’s illegal here in the states😭
Ugh i want to go back to this time sooooo bad!! Before technology and unnecessary drama.
i wish i knew where to get that mould ...its lovely
What Barbour the sugar?
No sweetener?
AAAAHHHH A NEW VIDEO
No sugar? How weird
If I send a letter to English Heritages site and ask for Kathy Hipperson's autograph do you think they'll send one to me. I'm American so even if I send in $60+ with the letter, will they be able to trade that for British pounds?
Sweet woman.
What a beautiful channel !
Does she really lives in a castle?
I think this is the first time I hear her laughing.
Where do they have molds like that?
Why no sugar
Such a pretty mold! 🌹🥛
oooooooooh....ohhhhhhhh!
بريتيش وومن از مقرف Woooo
for those of us unable to use alcohol, is there a particular liquid that would be a good substitute? I understand she stays true to old recipes, but perhaps some followers can offer non alcoholic sugestions. Since brandy adds some sweetness, the sub would need to have a rich flavor with sweetness.
makes me feel like the irish stableboy whose extra job for the day was to get all of Mrs. Crocombe’s ingredients for this custard. It was raining and he offered to go so that she wouldn’t have to. She ended up letting him watch the process of making the custard because she always does. It’s only part of the way through that she realizes that he hasn’t got the right ingredient and has to use gelatin, but she assures him that it isn’t a big deal and lets him have a bit of the blackcurrant jam she’s made.
I know gelatin sure is part of the pudding, but didn’t see it got used in the vid 🤔 Still enjoyed it anyway
She is am amazing cook, or really chef, I love how she takes the time to make everything not only taste good (as I am sure it does) but the presentation is really good.  If she had a restaurant I would love to go and eat at it, seriously she is so talented.
Fantastic!
I would inhale that
Hmmm... nearly drooled on my phone. Amazing video!
Its odd that the custard doesn't have sugar in it.
When you too much playing Assassin's Creed Syndicate until you are too obsessed with Victorian era.
European culture >
Where  buy mold like that?
We now know how she makes custard rather than using packet custard.
strange they had orange flower water and brandy it would taste better without
it looks delicious but where is the sugar ? Doesn't custard have sugar ?
She sounds like poren
Awesome
LOVE THISSSS
as far as I know Pudding is different from custard. I guess Im wrong
Love her!
We stan Mrs crocombe 👏✨
Man I want everything she makes.  Most of it has Liquor in it.

Edit: I am putting together Easter dinner and want to make this but I am US based and we dont have single cream.  What can I use to get it as close as possible?
03:08 the Victorian shade haha
it would be so interesting to have a historically correct show or movie like miss crocombe or townsend show in their videos instead of stuff like "vikings".  i know they are cooking channels but still there is everything around it, the utensils, the ingredients, the clothing. it is so interesting to watch them cook. if watching people cook in a past times manner brings in views, why cant a movie or show that plays in an other time period that is accurate do the same. if people would make the argument that beeing historically correct would be boring to watch... i guess not and they prove it.i think it makes it even more interesting
I don't like custard, but my in-laws do.
that's the prettiest dish I have ever seen.
I wonder how do the eqipmet in the kitchen work? like the ice box and the stove. how do you regulate the heat?
The Victorians knew whats up with the copper and wood kitchenware.
thought it was tofu
I'm not convinced: if it's a cleanser of the palate, the very fragrant blackcurrant jam will be too much because too sweet and the brandy will be nauseating at this moment. If it is a dessert it is necessary to sweeten the cream a little otherwise the preparation will have a bland taste of milk.
No sugar in the custard? How come? Is it not a dessert?
I loved how she licked her finger and said "ohh very good" lol
She reminds me of a patient that belongs in a mental hospital
Does anyone else feel like they could probably make this?
That looks so tasty
What is the difference between single cream and double cream? Would I use heavy whipping cream in this case? Thank you!
I would like to see them putting up fruits and vegetables, canning for the winter months.
The mold is life
Hehehe
I want to make that!!!!!
Wtf is orange flower water?
Scone recipe please please please!!!’
Correct me if I’m wrong but did an egg yolk get left in the bowl??
Do all british desert have Brandy in it?
Is it okay if we don't add the brandy? Because I'm a kid.
Cut pudim! Cuttt
Do all brits do that with their eyebrows?
Did anyone notice the laughter at 1:39 ?
It's really beautiful, but... no sugar? And serve it with black currant jelly? I don't think I would appreciate it.
What about sugar ?
Panna Cota
Who else just cheers her on the whole time while eating pizza?!
But this custard taste NOTHING !!!!!
love!
1:55 is that a third egg yolk still remaining in the bowl?
Is this similar to clotted cream? <american, so excuse my ignorance haha
Victorian times dirt,sick times
01:39 even fish fingers??
Pannacota victoriana....
Whos grandma is this
Ferry good
She looks like how I’d imagine Mrs peregrine to look like from the book
This is the recipe for diabetes
I'd like to know, if Mrs. Crocombe ran out of certain ingredients like orange flower water... would it be alright for to restock? or because she would be using the purse of lord and lady Braybrooke, would she would need their permission? were such ingredients treated common like herbs and spices? or rarer and thus used more sparingly?
neotbeok ceokbeok
Why am I watching this?
Why don't have chinese?
Gordon's Grandmother!
Love the recipe n all but jfc ur using so many pots. Could just easily transfer to the pot on the stove
I like this chick
I feel like the addition of brandy ruins it. But then again I feel like the Victorians put brandy in everything.
Why no sugar? The Victorians surely had sugar, no?
Fancy
I’d love to try that!
“Ooh very good.” “;)”
This movie will be,"The Mrs,Ladies Victorians".
i thought this was gonna be some funny video about how bad food sue to be but i see it's not
I have two problems: first, I can't obtain orange-flavoured water; I live in a
developing country.... Second and last, I've never been able to unmold a
gelatin dish without tearing it apart... Maybe I used bald molds...  Maybe
I need to watch a video about how to unmold gelatin properly!
Korean plz ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Lovely
Lovely
I WOULDN’T WANT TO CHEAPEN IT
Can u eat it ?
I tried it and it was truly divine
What was that ingredient you said you were replacing with gelatin? It sounded like ice glass to me but not sure what that is.
I hope it tastes as good as it looks.
Yummyyy 😋
Delicious, I want to make it. is there a way to make orange flower water at home....?
The  Teletubbies want to know your location
So cute 🥰
I'm waiting for Benedict cumberbatch dressed like Sherlock, i'm not sure why.
1:43 I can’t be the only one who saw another egg yolk that was left behind
That’s really pretty!
Looks  yummy
who is she
What is ginger wine?
Custard is really good... I don’t know why it’s not really used in American desserts
I’d absolutely love to have a go at Mrs Crocombe’s custard pudding.
Ubrudzila 7 naczyń, chore
I would have thought that they would have been scraping the bowls or making sure the full amount of ingredients went in. There was a whole egg yolk left in the dish while she was whisking the ones she tipped into the bowl and the cream that was left when she added it into the eggs I would have used a spatula to get it all out. Looked amazing and loved the woman. Must have been because it was a demonstration that’s all. My mum would be going loopy leaving all that behind.
“Im now gonna put it in the ice box”👌🏻 British English for u Americans 🤣
Tan
Did anyone get what she said what she usually uses instead of gelatine? 
Great video!!
Where are the pigeon feet.
What exactly is orange flower water
So she just did a sculpture and didn’t eat it? I wanted her to eat it for us so we can at least understand the reaction! Damn
Get Mrs. Crocombe a new dress 1886
please .... could anyone explain what is single cream? I live in Brazil, so I have no idea what it is.
Is this the place where the Sucker music video by Jonas Brothers was taken?
isn't that panna cotta?
When does the gelatin go in, missed that step. Please share if you got it. Cheers :)
So is "airmond" a historical pronunciation, or a regional one that's still around?
I noticed there was more of an echo in this video. Maybe English heritage could show us how big the kitchen really is?
But... there's no sugar in it... is there sugar in the orange water?
I'm sorry, she listed just egg yolks in the ingredients but actually uses whole eggs?
where the hell do I get orange flower water??? lol.
Hello intelligent friends ! My dumb self did not get the "cheapen" joke! Will someone be kind enough to explain? Thank you in advance!
Good day. I'm watching this in 1881 and I was a bit confused by the unorthodox use of French units for the cream. I was able to look up the conversion to our British Imperial units and it's about 26 ounces, or a pint, a gill, two tablespoons and two teaspoons. Although I don't think it necessary to be so precise. For our friends in America using the older, slightly larger ounces, it's about one ounce less. Perhaps some other viewers will find this information helpful.
what accent is that supposed to be?? lol it goes from british to american to irish multiple times 😂😂
What happened to the Brandy? Was it just for our Queen to chug while she cooks?
Looks very nice but is there no suger in the custard?
I never realized how grateful I have reason to be for the invention of the rubber spatula!
At first I was like, did she say she usually used isinglass? Then I looked it up, and yes, she did, it's a thickening substance derived from fish bladders. I had it confused with fiberglass!
Anybody noticed she left an egg yolk
She’s cute and feisty, like a cat.
Cooper containers are dangerous, 'cause of cancer and other sickness
I want to know what orange flower water tastes like, anyone tried it?
GIVE US LORD AND LADY BRAYBROOKE!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have a question! The only way I know custard is with a lot of sugar in it? Is this a different kind? I live in Sweden so  it might be different from what I’m used to?
I dont even know why I’m watching this but I can’t stop watching lol
I was distracted by her weird face.
this re-enactment is cool and all, but how about a change of dress from time to time?
Mrs crocombe has the ability to turn men to jelly
Let's address the elephant in the room, she left a whole egg yolk in the egg yolk bowl. Oh dear.
IS single cream the same as  light whipping cream in the US?
Nice video, the only part that bother me is egg yolks scene. You said egg yolks but the only thing i see is egg white, i think a bowl of egg yolks might be a better idea, or if you want then “the momment mrs. Crocombe dropped the egg yolk into a bowl with a bit of her hand holding half of the egg shell in the scene” might work as well. Also the motion in this scene is not really stable.
Is this not Blancmange?
she didn't put the gelatin
No sugar or condense milk to sweeten it.??
Mr. Bean is that u
I always smile when i watch you cook. My husband ❤❤❤ kedgree. I make it for breakfast  about 4x a week. He cant enough. Thank you.
About halfway through the video my inner "historytrash fangirl" started to bubble up within me. . .


x)
Prettiest pudding ever..!! Ahh.. this was such a treat 😍
I love the music at the beginning and end. Takes me to a simpler, but still foreign (as an American) time. Makes me feel wistful.
I was watching another video and saw this come up.  Switched over immediately.  Love you, Mrs Crocombe!
Everytime I watch these I'm like "where's the brandy where's the brandy AH there it is! :-D"
I see any upload of Ms Crocombe I hit like and play immediately.
This is so lovely! Some day I'd love to see a collection of these recipes with small addendums for the modern age, in case we wanted to make something aligning to this but repurposed. Not in the videos themselves of course! The videos being era perfect are vital to how soothing and lovely it is~
😋😋😋😋
Looks good enough to eat😋
Who wouldn't eat it anyday??? 😍🤗😊
British Baddie
Might be the only food dish she's made that I would actually eat. I bet the Christmas punch would go well with it.
Cream, egg yolks, and brandy? sign me up!
That looks delicious. I have a question—I notice Mrs. Crocombe pours things but doesn't scrape the bowls. Is that perhaps something that is common now because flexible plastic spatulas enable it? Cream seems like a premium ingredient for my small pocketbook so I was a bit surprised. But maybe we just don't see those moments due to editing.
So it is Victorian Panacota :)
Another way of making pudding is with corn flour ,egg yolks,milk,vanilla flavour if u want a vanilla pudding or strawberry juice if u want a strawberry pudding and sugar. Bring all to boil and they will thick cuz of the corn flour and that's it.. without having to freeze 🙄. And why she puts alcohol in everything.. god...
My 4 year old daughter loves your videos so much!! ❤️👏🏼
Very Nice...!
What ingredient did she say she couldn't get and had to replace with gelatine? I've replayed the bit where she says it several times and just can't make out the word...
Huzzah! I love her, and I love her notebook! I actually have my own, I've copied down recipes from my mother and grandmother in it! So I can definitely agree with her advice!
Perhaps I'll add this recipe to my own book. C:
I would love to see an episode on eccles cake. Keep up the good work!
Ive been dying for a new video
Mrs. C that custard looks grand! I suppose cooks through the ages have faced the same problem -- a good recipe leaves so much washing up!
Ojalá algún día partan y prueben la comida que hacen. Me gustaría ver mejor la textura y consistencia de estas recetas.
I honestly love this series so much! I got so excited when this came up. Looks delicious!
Yay, no feet!
Have to add this to my notebook cookbook.
Is custard some sort of panna cotta?
She didn’t even eat it ugh
No sugar at all?
I don’t want to do anything this week. Can I come over and help cook? lol
Did she cook the gelatin?
So is just a custard an American pudding?
MRS.CROCOMBE, YEEEEEEEES!
Am I the only one who was disturbed when she quickly sucked the tip of her finger to taste it
how did I get here?
Why was this recommended to me? Where am I
Would be delicious if it didn’t have a dead animal in it...
What did she Want to use instead of Gelantine?
I've never clicked on a video so fast!
прекрасное видео)
Looks gorgeous! What great presentation 💜💜💜💜
1:37 NHNNNN
My evening is complete 😍
This takes me back to childhood. My grandma, and later my mum were keen on these types of dessert, I doubt that I ever had packet desserts, always home made. I'm fairly sure they made them without the alcohol though, at least when I ate them...but who knows? I still love custard today, but not the yellow stuff you buy.

I also inherited an identical mould from mum.
AMAZING
I want that custard mould!
Give the writers an award.
looks yummy
I've always though "pudding" is made with old bread let sit for months... Not with custard. :o
What alternative Brandi.
Mai hamasha aap ki dish dekti hu mujhe bohat acchi lage ti hai mare bhi channel naya zaika hai aap hamare dish dekha agar aap ko pasant aaye to aap hamare channel ko subscribe kare😘😘😘👍👍👍👍
So white
Very good
Just to make sure, kids can enjoy this too right?  Even though the brandy has not been cooked off??
Aren't black currant just  BlackBerrys?
J
What was it that Mrs. Crocombe meant to make it with rather than gelatine?
Wait what? Eisenglas? Isenglass? Aisenglas? What is that?
<3 maravilloso <3
so damn delightfull
Mrs. Crocombe! I am addicted to your kitchen.   :-)
Looks  interesting!!!!
How am I so early????
yum!
So interesting that there's no sugar.
Who eats what they make for the show? Does the crew get to?
So. .. Because the custard is for the second course is that why there isn't any sugar? Beautiful mold though.
im sad that cream almost doesnt exist in my country. Only whipping cream, condensed milk, evaporated milk and regular milk does :( i think only the eggs and gelatine are easily accessible here.
boring
Me, as an American: "what the heck is orange flower water? Custard can be custard pudding? GELATINE SHEETS?! UHHH we have packs! We have eggs most definitely!... I would fail at making this."
Is she actually old or is that just makeup
I thought it would be a dessert, but it has no sugar.
I now know that she's single because of the single cream
The custard doesn’t take sugar ????
I really love these videos but most of the recipes are inedible to me 🤷🏼‍♂️
I've asked it before, English Heritage, I'll ask it again - When is the Cookery Book being released? Surely, you're NOT going to miss out on another Christmas, are you? Do you actually HAVE anybody involved in Marketing? Anyway, all the best to you. Still.
Did you forget the,sugar?
Surely custard has sugar or honey to sweeten it?
This sounds really good, I need to try this recipe!
Looks delicious.👍🏻
Sounds wonderful!
SO GOOD LOOKING WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Lovely !  I do love your videos !
Yes!
Oh yes. This is sure to be a excellent recipe
"I think Lord Braybrook would eat it with anything" even fish sticks?
I need a definition of terms. What does "custard" mean, exactly?

And I see that "pudding" was already moving away from always being something stodgy and usually boiled.
@englishhertitage Thank you so much for your lovely videos. They are so informative, funny and entertaining about all things historical and British! I am curious about artificial leaveners (baking powder and soda ) in the Victorian age. I notice that most of he cakes and cookies that Ms Crocombe makes tend to do without it. I’m from America and baking powder took off here in the mid 19th century I think. I am wondering if Ms. Crocombe will show us recopies including baking powder? Anyway thank you so much for this lovely content and I can’t wait for the next episode!
That’s a panne cotta. That’s all
I don’t know why I’m watching this when I’m never gonna make it and I’m 12 I don’t even know what curdle means
This isn't how I usually make custard but OK
Beautiful!!!
So comfortable to "be in Mrs. Crocrombie's kitchen" while she cooks. Has anyone come up with a vegan version of this? Too much milk and eggs in one food for me. Would at least like to substitute milk.
3:36 Ooh got a little...s3xual there.
Stop living in the past, old woman =“=
If it has gelatin in it ,,,,, is not consider a PUDDIN .
Us Americans will have to substitute the blackcurrant jam with blackberry, blueberry, or huckleberry jam most likely. We don't eat blackcurrant in the U.S. because it was illegalized in the early 1900's due to the threat of common diseases that inflict them spreading to the pine trees here. It might possibly be legal now to import it, but it's almost impossible to find in stores. I don't even know what blackcurrant tastes like. Is it similar to huckleberries or elderberries?
Is this an actor or is she legit living like that era
That looks good!
woman + kitchen = love
The way she talk is annoying idk why im annoyed.😂😂 but She COOKED THE YUMMIEST PUDDING I SEE!!!
You're kidding me with this channel. I mean the recipes are awesome but the setup is a little on the "hard to believe side"
What's with the forced accent and awkwardly timed pauses? Couldn't they find someone better for this job? I like the recipes, but this woman is insufferable.
Can I use lemon curd instead of jam? I hate jam
So no sweetener added at all? Or is it more an accompaniment for savoury and sweet dishes? Interesting to have a rather bland custard, but I would add sugar
The more I watch your videos the more I recognise that the dishes are not done by Mrs. Crocombe. However, your videos are so nice that it doesn't matter.
This saddens me. I love the beauty of old England. The class, the art, the brilliance...and now the country is being over ran by degenerates and "refugees"  The culture of England must be saved and preserved before it is too late!
"And now since its a pigeon pie-"
Me: haha little birdy pie crust shapes
"We'll add the feet"
what
There's like $600 worth of ingredients in that thing...
“And as it’s a pigeon pie, I shall add some feet” best line ever. I wouldn’t be able to say that with a straight face.
Tried to make this and it didn't go well. Those pigeons are fast even when i remained still and used the best bread crumbs. After 2 days and no rest, i was out of breath and collapsed in the park when they then decided to mock me, circling going "rooo" "roo" and bobbing their heads in content they won over me. Now i am missing both the port and the madera, i had to drown my sorrows. PS: Chickens eggs are easier to get than quail eggs!!! Those little ones bite really hard.
"A few truffles" Yup, time to go bankrupt.
This went from a hearty pie to a Voodoo ritual.  I still love Mrs. Crocombe!
You know I landed on one of her videos by accident and now I'm on my 6th video in a row and I cant stop...help.
That is the kind of food that makes you feel like dieting for the rest of your life.
She forgot to add a little beak and some eyes...maybe a wing on the side
Makes a pie lined with meat stuffed with more meat and eggs. Someone asks if theres any vegetables in this meat apocalypse. Mrs Crocombe stares intently for a second and squints. And in a serious voice says ' we dont have time for that nonsense.' And with an unblinking stare sticks pigeon feet on top to make her point. No one questions Mrs. Crocombe. No one.
When she said, "feet," I thought, "Oh, that clever Marianne must have good knife skills to cut out feet shaped pastry pieces."  Nope.  No fake pastry feet crap back in the good old days.
It looks like the pigeon sky dived into that pie and got stuck, I'm dying over here 😂😂😂
Vegan nightmare lol
Everyone is going on and on about the feet all I could think about is WHERE’S THE SALT???????
It was all going so well until the feet.
Now i know why there is hardly any animals left in England
This actually looks pretty disgusting :D 
Great video 🙂👍🏽
pigeons WERE harmed in the making of this video
I am laughing so hard at the comments on this video.
I love that in the description it said " A few truffles." Like its no big deal. Audley End House was balling!
Making this pie is quite a... feat.
Someone call Gordon Ramsey
I usually just take a peanut butter sandwich with me when I go out.
Nothing is salted
I wasn't expecting it to have actual pigeon in it when i read the title xD
I gave up and went to KFC for a chicken pot pie... They'd run out of pigeon pot pie.
I am so glad that she did not forget the feet. Perfect.
After adding the feet, it looked like she shoved a damn whole bird in with only the feet sticking out. The kids and I hyena-cackled. XDD
The Brits are out of their mind for this one.
It's... a meat pie lined with more meat? Mrs. Crocombe, you are a marvel!
My late grandmother taught me this recipe. I went on to win a cooking contest with other schools in my local area. Served with a world war 2 era treacle tart with honey drizzled ice cream.  I also used her baking mould she got from her grandmother
👍🤔... and a partridge in a pear tree😆
Lost my absolute shit laughing when Mrs Crocombe casually pulled out a couple of birds feet for garnish.
Ok go off Mrs C.! Love this channel.
this looks disgusting to eat but it's always interesting to learn what kinds of stuff people used to make back then. still love watching this series as always <3
Yes, I'm that scared vegan you're looking after. 😳😂
This pie is King of Kings.

3 weeks worth of food and a good night outs worth of drink stuffed in a pie casing.

I love it.
Perfect pie to bring to my vegan friends thanksgiving gathering (:
Wait she's serious? 






Omg she is
Everything was perfect...



Until the pigeon feet were placed on top 🤢
COLD LUNCH?! 

OMG they ate that monstrosity of mincemeat and boiled eggs and stock/broth...COLD? 

I...can’t.
Oh no way everything inside is not cooked well specially all the meat
I laugh just knowing there's definitely an entire production crew just out of frame 😂
In the beginning of the video the groom is walking the horse for the Lord and Lady Braebrook's niece to ride saddle in their "how to ride side saddle" video uploaded like a couple years ago lol He said it usually takes him 12 minutes to get  the horse all saddled up and out front but it's been years!
How much would that cost to make today? Truffles, pigeon breast, veal...WOW
I am literally laughing tears at the comments under this video 😂 thank you once again mrs crocombe, I shall try this dish once I have become as wealthy as lord and lady braybrooke :D
Wonderful, Mrs. Crocombe, I'd been looking for the perfect dish to offset the jack-o'-lanterns next Halloween!




Love your channel~ <3
Epic Meal Time, the proper way.
Umm nobody talks about the mold??? Like where can I find one of these molds?? 😅
This is the least appetizing meal Mrs. Crocombe has ever made
Eating leftover pigeons while hunting seems a bit heavy handed.
I thought GAME OF THRONES will be in comments!!
Well no !!
*let me seed the GOT comment*
*Me wanting to watch the video*
*Me going through the comments until the intro ends*
*Sees comments about bird feet in the pie*
Shall I watch it further guys? I'm scared



Edit: I keep on watching and I don't know when that is
Edit2: Omg she just did it out of nowhere without a warning omg kill me
My eye widened a little when she said "let us add some few feet"
7:25 ok this looks ok. 

 7:33 WHY WOULD YOU ADD THE FEET!!!!!!
I was thinking she meant pigeon feet that were pre-formed or pre-cut from a separate scrap or sheet of pastry dough.......... and then reality set in.
To serve, cut with your Valyrian steel sword and pair with poisoned wine.
Who else is binge watching these??
Why am I watching this? I should be asleep. How did I find this video anyway?
bruh the vegans are QUAKING
peta is shooketh 😂
Omg.. pigeons feet ..so creepy
Plus no salt 😆
"I should just add some feet," and then followed by 
"A practically perfect piegon pie." 😱😱😱😱 AHAHA
Not even british but these videos make me feel SO nostalgic! :o :D
I was like, "those pigeon feet????" Yep. They sure are
Nobody:
Mrs. Crocombe: And since this,is,a pigeon pie, we'll add the pigeon feet
those feet look like they're crawling up from the grave.
"and as it's a pigeon pie" 
It's pigeon meat outside, yep
"I should just add some feet"
I AM CONFUSION
"You will need".....
"Some truffles and quails eggs"
and a gun to hold up the bank with. :)
Food: exists
Victorian England: Better put some alcohol on it
The feet sticking out are hilarious 😂😂. I wouldn't be gross out if i was served out just laughing my eyes out. I mean we do put chicken feet in soups to flavour them and then eat them afterwards. So eh. Pigeon and duck meat is 20 times better than chicken. Chicken is so boring 😯
Me taking notes
Me: "aha... ok... mhhh... sounds good..."
Mrs. Crocombe: "I shall add some feet"
Me: "WHAT?! I'm out."
I love this channel but after being vegetarian for a year I had to really, really force myself through this one. 😂
Chicken feet make the best soup
Yo ma'am! Thanks! There is a lot of pigeons in the town square where I live.
One question: Can I also use pigeon eggs instead of quail? Cause those are expensive as hell!
British Humour - 
Pigeons look like they're trying to claw their way out of the pie.
Who needs Monty Python when you have Mrs. Crocombe!
Mary worked her fingers to the bone on them leaves
Imagine trying to serve this to a modern day 5 year old.....
Remember Rachel Greene from Friends, about British food?

"These people put very strange things in their food"
I don't know how to feel about eating pigeons myself. But I have great respect for this lady and for the people keeping up this old recipes and traditions, absolutely amazing!
lol the feet sticking out is actually hilarious, like it feels like how shel silverstein would draw "pidgeon pie" kudos, its so comical
Unless it is very young, meaning squab, pigeon is very tough. It is hard to believe an hour and a half in a pastry shell could do the job.

For those who took special note of the little feet added for decoration, be sure to look up the recipe for 'stargazy pie.'
Me: i'll watch this nice video about the victorian era. i love the victorian era.

>7 min mark 

Me:  WHAT ARE THOOOOOOSE
You say this was designed to be packed up and eaten later? Hm...
imagines sending future kids to school with this as their lunch
EDIT: Ah, but I'll have to modify it for cheapness...
You couldn't get anymore albino than this.
LMAO!! The outside looked tasty then she cut it open and I said NO THANKS!
with those feet it looks like, it'll fight back when you try to eat it LMAO I CANT BREATHESJV DIFVJN FV
Wait what feet????
I wonder for how many people is that one pie? It sure is a heavy-duty one.
Pigeon feet?  ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?
How I missed Mrs Crocombe recepies!
Awww, that British English... My ears pisses rainbow.
P.S. Sister, we need MOAR whiskey, m.b. even without a pie.=)))
looks beautiful. sounds very filling also. 
Thank you for your experience and expertise :)
you know... when i read "pigeon pie", i didn't think it would quite literally be a pie of pigeon...
honestly just thought it would be the design of the pie, i'm so-
did anyone notice the "practically perfect pigeon pie" part? :)))
Wonderful dish!!!  

Funny how these dishes which were once very economical, are now quite luxurious simply due to the changes in pricing since back then.
Not pigeon feet. 😯🤨🤦🏽‍♀️
I loved Downtown Abbey and everything but English cuisine is really... Interesting sometimes. 😂🤢
Absolutely love those recipes! So decadent and beyond modern thinking 😁 great video!👌 -RI👨‍🍳
A Practically perfect pigeon pie... now try saying that five times faster.
yall r weird getting grossed out by the feet . us asians eat chicken feet all the time . food is food kskdkdksks
Excellent Design In This Pie , I Prefer Southern Fried Crispy Free Range Chicken 🐔
The pie looks bland. How come she doesn’t season the meats 🤷🏻‍♂️
Oh god the feet
Adding the feet was the best part of this, I love these videos.
What you mean a little of the spice?!?!?!  That needed way more salt😂😂🤦🏾‍♀️
And as it is a Pigeon pie, I shall just ADD SOME FEET

watches the feet bend when she sticks them in
"And now since it's a pigeon pie, we'll add some feet."

Gordon Ramsey: hold my lamp sauce
Super barata essa receita!
Só me falta caçar os pombos debaixo do viaduto e farei a forma de 30dm
The lack of SEASONING is making me scream
My reactions:
1) Uuuh let's watch how to make a new pie
2) Wait.. Oh no, it's not sweet!
3) Noooo, dem feet! Why?
"I should just add some feet☺️"

MKAY THEN😂
Reminds me of the wizards in the Hogfather saying " How about we mix together absolutely everything...and see what happens". 🤣
Ok but Mrs. Crocombe really went off with this one huh? Yes ma'am serve those birds
Bird graveyard pie 🐦
The birds in the making of this episode were harmed - BIG TIME!!! Rip :(
For this recipe you will NIIIID...I ADORE HER.
Usually I'm all in for her recipes.  This one however, makes me a little nauseous.
you guyz always saying shape of U
but where's the shape pf FOOD???
Personally, I would rather put the spices in the stock. I want their tastes to spread out even more.

That's the Indonesian in me talking.
Me: I need sleep
My brain: watch a sassy English woman make a pie
Make skygazy pie.
The 17 dislikes are pigeons
Looks delicious, the pie looks good as well.😉
I noticed a lack of Game of Thrones references in the comments, and so-
“How would you say he died, then?”
-“Choked on his pigeon pie."
“So you would blame the bakers?"
-“Or the pigeons, just leave me out of it."
I would try the pigeon but I'm not fond of ham.
Im getting hungry looking at this despite being very sick a few hours ago. I always love Mrs. Crocombe's recipes, and I plan to try to make a few of them one day =D!
I don't know why but adding the feet cracked me up.
This reminds me of a rich, savory British version of Il Timpano.
She just?? poured in all the liquids??? mrs Crocombe????
So sad, pigeons contributed so much during world war 1 and 2.
And now we're gonna show YOU how Americans make english tea!
(waves Don't Tread On Me flag)
"YEEAH! YEAAH!"
That feeling when you're more bothered by the whole cloves than the pigeons' feet.
Im vegetarian, but d*mn this looks good
Margaery Tyrell: “Oh, look, the pie!”
Are those real pigeon feet??? Oh my goodness I am close to puking 😭 And I love English Heritage 😭
The food is absolutely to die for.
Funnily enough, "pie" in Spanish means "foot", so I wasn't surprised at all with the plot-twist
I am a English major  and watching this takes me to a wonderful world which is found in books. Thankful for these videos. ♥️
And I thought the turducken was bad... Great video! And holy cow, I'd never eat that thing. Way too many meats with different flavors. T_T
lo que comio Jeoffrey el dia de su boda 😂
I got as far as Whiskey.
Then I knew I'd never actually do this!!
The only thing I didn't like was the idea of biting into a whole clove
Finally, a recipe I can make with stuff I just happen to have around the house!
I've always been an Anglophile, but I cannot stop watching these videos!
1 word, 1 feeling







DESGUSTANG
You have to have mace. The day somebody tries to feed me pigeon they gonna get mace in the face.
Scotland: let’s take tons of innards and make a..pudding..thing?

Victorian England: Hold my beer
EW OMG THE CRUSTY FEET STICKING OUT OF THE MIDDLE NOOO
HOlyWOW!  That looks Delicious!!!  I would make this.
Eat up every one:
Me : ✋🏿 Uhm...I'll take the piece from the bottom left please .
Lol, the reaction of some viewers. Here in the TX border they sell chicken feet at HEB.
Lady : Help yourself with the pie
Me : But you shoved pigeons in it, I could see their feet🤣
The Peruvian government was to know your location.
Love this series. Everything was great... until the feet walked in... 🥶
Wow wow wow wow isn't truvvel like ann expensive type of a thing like really expensive 😧😱🤯
It should be named midevil pie or creepy pie! 😱😱😱🥧
Do u know that Madeira is a native Indian drink and was taken to Portugal by Portuguese and named the so called- port.
Proud to be an Indian.....
"I've already greased my mold" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Finally, someone understands that pigeon pie is not from Game of Thrones.
which absolute genius came up with this though?? how did that conversation go down?
"hmm, this pie with like three kinds of meat and a bajillion eggs and casual truffles everywhere is missing something."
"what could you possibly add to it??"
"fEET."
that is about 400 bucks worth of truffles, I would do another layer of quail eggs since I raise quail and those are cheap lol
Umm, I can only hear music no voice, and, as I'm not a lip reader I'm screwed.
"I'll just add some feet." 🤢
Lord where am I supposed to find pigeon breast
Shoots. Why the giraffe is now an endangered species.
I’m really glad that there’s people out there teaching cool historical stuff like this cause learning is fun and important. The production value is great, and the aesthetic gives me such pleasant vibes.

That being said, I can’t fucking express enough how much Victorian food pisses me off.
what do pigeons and truffles taste like?
Oh god the feet really threw me off guard
That's an interesting touch there at the end. Nothing says bon appetit as pigeon feet crawling out of a pie.  😅😅😅
I have tears running down my face with  laughter reading some of the comments so funny .
how did they pack lunches for these trips? just wondering
The feet give me the actual creeps when she pokes them in... I just can’t... I can’t...
Hanging out with friends in a pub; English Heritage uploads new video 
Me: *stops talking and plays the video as if my life depended on it!!!
I'm vegan. Why do still watch these videos. 😅
What would we like to see next?  Something simple and tasty for the servants or another fancy dish for Lord and Lady Braybrooke?
No salt in this recipe? Watch the comments. :'D
I've missed the cooking videos!!!
Four and twenty blackbirds,
Baked in a pie.
When the pie was opened
The birds began to sing;
Wasn't that a dainty dish,
To set before the king.
Those feetsies, though ^^
I must repeat myself: I LOVE Mrs Crocombe!
As soon as I saw “Pigeon Pie”, I thought of GoT.
Such a strange mix of ingredients
LMFAO I could say so much but I won't. My goodness. I am going try this
absolutely amazing how poor old world servants ate better healthier meals than a majority of today's more sophisticated and "better off" 21st century people
As a meat eater myself this looks repulsive... but I still, weirdly and morbidly, wanna try it.
As for the ingredients, so far I have salt... I'd love to try it!
I wonder if Queen Elizabeth watches this program, or if she ate this when she was younger. The mysteries of the Royal Family.
It looks like a scary lasagna.
That is a HEARTY pie! Holy crap.
what about a clay pigeon pie?
Uhh I forgot I left the bath running at home gotta go bye
I'd just like to add that peeling quail eggs takes some skill to not tear them to pieces! LOL
I have never had the idea of eating pidgeon until now......  Now I actually want to try some....
You are such a beautiful person I love watching your videos there amazing
I m surprised no one said anything about joffrey from Game of thrones and his love for pigeon pies:))))
Qustum aq bide süs olsun diye ayaklarını koydu 😂
The way the little feet are sticking out reminds me of those Halloween decorations which are designed to look like a witch’s legs sticking up out of the ground or a flower pot or something 😂
You're an amazing cook but I don't think I could stomach this one.
Pigeon meat looks so much like beef liver. Wow is that purple lol.
Omg pigeons are edible!!😦
Could do with some salt garlic n chillies! Then it be yummier! ✌️
I appreciate the channels decision to include this recipe though it would expectedly be less popular with some viewers. History is history! And I enjoyed it very much as always. :D
Everything about this is incredibly hilarious.
ah I wanted to see how it looks inside after cooking..
Repulsive yet compelling at the same time. :) Something tells me a plowman migt be able too smell that . But then I understand he would have eaten heather. Thank you for sharing
Because it is a Pidgeon Pie Im going to add Pidgeon Legs.... 

Hahahahahahahahahaha!
Queen of style, using pigeon feet as a fascinator like a True Victorian.
Something bird related must always be on top.
Pigeons can carry cryptosporidium, trichomonas, candida...  eat at your own risk.
Here in Chile still today some people eat chicken feet soup. You are not suposed to eat it, it is used to give flavor to the soup, very popular though.
I'll need a small loan of a million dollars to make this recipe.
This is some of that ole bad British cooking.  No, thank you!
I’m skeptical all those packed layers of meat  would cook through in 90 min.....
It looks incredible but the feet.... the feet genuinely terrify me.
Where's the SALT ?? and the feet as decorations ..what marvellous idea ! LOL
why am I, a pigeon lover, watching this?
the world may never know
This pie is practically perfect in all possible ways :D
I was expecting "pigeon pie" to be like a nickname for the recipe... Was not expecting to see a video using actual pigeons
Use Madeira wine, is the best!
Reminds me of Rachel's triffle from FRIENDS LOL
Ms.Kathy, darlin', YOU Are Mrs.Crocombe. 
As Jeremy Brett WAS the the definitive Sherlock Holmes, and David Burke, Dr. Watson, so you have become the peerless portrayer of Mrs. Crocombe.
You are adorable.
Thank you, so much, for the research,  authenticity, and being so adorable, in & out of, character.
Such does wonders for the education of the ignorant, and stimulation of the partially learned.
Lord have mercy on me 🤢🤒🥴💀☠️
As a history lover, I’m enthralled. As a vegan, I’m horrified.
Are we talkin’ New York pigeons?
I could eat this if you stop at the veal and ham. You can add the mushrooms and spices, but I'll pass on everything else...🤮
It looked cute ln the thumbnail... But pidgeon looks disgusting and I won't start on the feet 😂
But I noticed that all my favorite british movies were filmed there ♡
Is the pigeon free range or was it raised in captivity?
OMG the number of people going on about the feet 🤣 
1) They didn't eat the feet, they're for decoration / identification
2) If you eat meat, you should use as much of the animal as possible, out of respect.
3) Chicken feet are a delicacy in some cultures.
4) We shouldn't shy away from the parts of history that may offend or shock modern sensibilities - that's a dangerous path
5) The Tudors made peacock pie, and served the pie covered by the (uncooked, still feathered) skin - normal is relative

Well done EH - I'm sure there were extensive discussions around the potential backlash, but staying true to the original was the right choice!
OMG thank god its not an ostrich-pie, can you imagine THAT feet in the pie
Okay but the feet for decoration tho😂😂😂 WHY.
Quite beautiful,  but I prefer chicken instead pigeons.
Okay um...the host is gorgeous. Alright, bye.
Excessive amount of meat by modern standards, but fascinating to watch. And it makes sense in the Victorian era as I understand. Meat, especially game, still being a showcase of wealth and luxury.
The bird feet in the pie hole really adds that extra touch doesn't it. Miss Crocombe I adore you but this is simply diabolical.
What perfection!👏👏👏
Some pigeons seem to have fallen head first into the pigeon black hole pie, their feet sticking out of the pigeon black hole's  event horizon.
If I ever end up on death row...that’s what I want for my last meal. Feet and all 😁
Such a beautiful and relaxing video 🥰
I love this series.  So happy to see you back!
You wouldn’t pay me enough to eat pigeon meat 😷😂
I thought the it's called as "Pigeon pie" because of it's looks or something but holy shit it's literally a pigeon pie.
The agony of de feet.
You are missing the Frey's flesh
Ok sis what we cooking today! 😁 this lady gives me so much joy
this is like an older version for timpano. cool!
Meanwhile, I'm here thinking about  the Pigeon Pie that Joeffrey destroyed with his sword
A lot of people here don't seem to know that displaying what you were eating was very popular with the upper-classes during this time. Cooks would often go through great lengths to make Frankenstein-like creations with their meat, like some type of artistic display, to then go on to the dinner table. Of course today this has changed drastically as we are so used to buying pre-cut meats in nice and shiny packaging...
.

A few pigeon feet is like parsley to them lol.
i laughed so damn hard at the feet part!
Never mind the feet-think of the cross contamination risk mixing raw fowl with cooked pork and raw veal! Better cook that thing quick...and make sure it's well done. I wonder how many got poisoned in pre-refrigeration times.
I thought it said "PECAN" not "PIGEON"!
Amazing recepie. Love idea with chocolate.
This Pigeon pie reminds me of king Joffery's death🙄🙄in GOT
I was done at the quails eggs, bleeeeck.
im so glad i wasnt around during these times, this isnt my kind of eating
I am ur new subscriber from Bangladesh
Would the cloves not have been ground? I can't imagine the gentry enjoying cracking their teeth on whole cloves.
We love a Victorian cooking queen!
the feet still has claws, were they used as toothpick or something ? 😅
Is there a Mr. Crocombe?  Does he get to taste your cooking?
Oh what a yummy looking pie!
But whats in it?
A practically perfect pigeon pie - try saying that five times fast
I was half expecting something GOT, and ya, I wasn't disappointed.
The lack of seasoning for so much meat has me concerned. Wow..... PS, #Gout
Practically perfect indeed 😂
Pigeons?!! What the heck, am I from Venezuela or something?!!
Gurl if this is what rich people in mansions ate then I don't want to know what common folk had for dinner. Probably rat porridge and if they wanted to really party it up they added salt when they could afford it. 

Pass the  dessert please!
I love meat, and I love eating strange things (including insects. They're delish, you should try them), but the amount of different meats in this pie unexpectedly grossed me out xD. I could also imagine the pidgeon feet being quite delicious if seasoned. Crunchy for sure xD!
Mrs Crocomb is why I came and 8:40 is why I stayed
Love it~ on point! Adding pigeon would be VERY Victorian!
Truffles must have been cheaper in those days!
I’m obsessed with the Victorian Era thanks to this channel! ❤️
You should make rice pudding!
She said “👌🏻🦶🏻🐥🥮”
You don't want to rinse that blood away before packing it into the pie? yuck lol
omg who is this buxom goddess?
Litttle pigeon feet.  Aaaagggghhhhh 🙀🙀🙀😂😂🤣🤣
Just make sure that old lady didn't poison your red wine before you eat
Omg!!! Did she say feet! That broke my heart 😨
Next week, jumbo turkey pie:  "Now I'll just finish it off with the feet."  😐
The recipe was gag worthy enough but the feet on top were all I could take
I usually want to recreate the recipes, but this is too much for my American palette
Patiently waiting for the next Mrs. Crocombe video....it's been more than 2 weeks! I'm compulsively checking multiple times a day. Where are you Mrs. Crocombe????
I see where epic mealtime got their inspiration from.
“we’ll add the feet.”

jazz music stops
Hehe, this was posted on my Birthday. Am I cursed with pigeons?
It was a fun video until she put the pigeon’s feet 🤢🤮
I'm absolutely fascinated by Victorian era cuisine & I must say that this dish is quite intimidating to say the least! Whether or not I like all the ingredients, the preparation & display are most impressive :)
Question where do I get pigeons??
That's one hell of a figure!!! ❤
I watched it just because GOT xP
So the vegan version would be... mushrooms?
This makes me feel like the irish stableboy that works under Mr. Barker, and he has sent the stableboy out to Mrs. Crocombe’s early, because Mr. Barker can handle the stables for now, and Sylvia’s sick so she’ll need some extra hands to help her with her pie that she’s making for shooting. Mrs. Crocombe doesn’t exactly need the help, but she’s fond of the stableboy and likes to tell him all about her cooking while he prepares the ingredients for her (after, of course, she’s given him a stern talking-to about washing his hands). Once she’s done with the pie, she sends him off with a few tea cakes and biscuits that she’s stealthily pushed into his pack (“he’s far too skinny for his age, he’ll stunt his growth!”) and tells him to go help Mr. Barker with mucking out the stables.
I will most definitely bring this to the next social event I'm invited to.
everything was ok till the pigeon feet came on.
An amazing recipe! I am delighted!
Wow I'm surprised it would be cooked all the way through in just 1 1/2 hours! It's huge!
Served to Walder Frey:)
Pigeon pie recipe.

Peruvians have entered the chat
something about this is REAL offputting
Why would you put the feet in-
is there a Another episode of cooking with Mrs Crocombe
NEEDS MOAR SEASONING
All that meat is making my mouth water so bad. I need to taste this pie at least once in my life
Heard about this channel in a townsends video. No regrets. <3
Screams in vegan
Very English indeed! Sounds like a good recipe, except for the feet!;)
I love this channel. But I hate how she rarely ever cuts into what she makes. I want to see how it would look on a plate!!!
I cannot stop watching her videos
Wow it’s actual pidgins I thought it was just a nickname 😯
Puta que pariu isso é Pombo vey como assim?
I was done at the "I'll just add some feet"
This looks reallu good minus the mushrooms and truffles
Pigeon feet?!?!? 😖 This recipe grossed me out! 🤢🤮
I haven't see veal available in the States for many years.  I wonder why?
Are NYC pidgeons okay?
See that crazy twinkle in her eye 😂  (English accent) really I am doing this for shock value and with a mischievous smile I say don't forget to remove the meat tokens with the pigeon foot toe nails...


You are amazing at what you do and beautiful. Very entertained right now!
“Ideal for using up pigeons”...
This recipe is what made the passenger pigeon extinct!
I wonder what it looks like in the inside 🤔 seems to have a lot of stuffing to be cooked evenly
That's a whole lot of different meats piled up together. The feet sticking out was the perfectly morbid finishing touch. 😅
I know everyone's talking about the feet- but that music cue
Whoever shoots these videos always does such an amazing job making every ingredient look gorgeous.
To be honest, if I was there while nobody was looking, my face would be in that pie
Casually puts in some birds legs.......ok
Lots of wholesome goodness in that meal
People eat pigeons?  Like the ones that peck at the park, beach, and just about anywhere else?
Who wants a full serie with Mrs Crocombe ?
“Since this is a pigeon pie, I should add some feet.”

Di- Did people actually find joy in knowing they were eating dead animals back then?
Albeit, most people were more in touch with the whole butchering process, but still!
Delightful! You've outdone yourselves again with this video. I've always wanted to make an English pie like this... perhaps without the feet ;)
I have a question...








What is veal
Oh so this is legit pigeon pie 😂
Sing the song of Sixpence, a pocket full of rye
Four and twenty blackbirds baked into a pie,
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing
"Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king?"
The king was in his counting house, counting out his money
The queen was in the parlor, eating bread and honey
While the maid was in the garden, hanging up the clothes
When along came a black bird, who pecked off her nose.
i was thinking it will be like the game of thrones thing. where pigeons fly when you cut the pie
7:19 Stop it! I´m dying ;-)
OMG! THE FEET! It went swimmingly until the feet! Love your videos! ❤️
To make this dish nowadays you gotta sell your house! 😂
Too much raw meat, and blood, and feet...

But great from the history side... 👍🏼
Me thinks these pigeons victims of fowl play. ;P
Can you eat the pigeons of today that fly around ?
I really thought her ladyship was a vegan
😂 she just added the feet like it was a cherry on top
I was not, in any way, shape, or form, prepared for those feet.
I LOVE this channel!!
This is so satisfying to watch!  💜💜💜
I was fine with it as she was constructing it, I eventually shrugged off the "decorative pigeon feet," but that sliced view of the pie makes me glad that I don't eat much of any meat anymore. XD XD XD
The feet part didn't suprise me at all tbh, my family make chicken foot soup when we are sick. Different cultures eat different things.
Mmm the toxoplasmosis in the bird feet adds a little je ne sais quoi #bonappétit
If I did this, I'd grind the spices together and marinate the pigeon with them.
I don't even eat meat?! 

But I do love the calmness of her voice and the feeling of being transported into Victorian era
Ya no one today would be able to afford this lol. I also personally couldn't make it because quail isnt legal here since it's .y state bird.
I would definitely throw in some garlic and onions, season the meat itself, and mince the pigeon breasts.
That the shooters could stop for lunch and eat this then continue hunting instead of taking a nap is probably what is most impressive.
The feeeeeeet 🤢🤢🤢
I'm wondering what are the macros of this
I don’t know why I instantly thought of game of thrones
The way she was shakin them bread crumbs 😂😂😂😂😂
all I can say....is "WOOOOOOOOW???!"
Pigeon feet as garnish? I think, no!
Dear God... Just make sandwiches! 😯
Don't tell me they're gonna put pigeons in it o.o


Edit 1: omg they really put pigeons in it !
Edit 2: omg they put pigeon feet in it too i think I've seen everything in life now.
OMG....I'm actually considering becoming a vegetarian after watching this.
I was looking forward to seeing cut - what does it look like on the inside???
LOVE!!! IT!!!!!!
Sky rat pie...nah man I'm good
English people still have a great sense of humor !  I love when you put the feet !
Mrs Crocombe looks so much like a wonderful friend of mine from long ago. She was vegan when I knew her. I really miss her.
All of the meat looks raw :(
“May I have a beef pot pie?” “Certainly, will that be with one hoof or two?”
Wasn't this the kind of pie that was served to Joffrey and Walder Frey?  🙈🙉🙊
Stuffs pie full of truffles like it's nothing.

Hello, let me just plop these pidgeon's feet right on top of that. :D
hay look pigeon pieeeeee. 10 sec latter jofry dies
My stomach kind of turned when she used blood for marinade..but had awesome ingredients like quail, and truffle. So yummy
U sure it cooked all the way thru?
I'm just going to add some feet
Why is this in my recommend like I’ve never watched a cooking video
this makes me wish I could still get around enough to cook meals.
I don't know how I came across this channel but I like it.
is it made with PIGEON
Pigeons: "Rats with wings."
Pardon, does anyone here know where the nearest Pub is?  After that, I need a pint and some chips.  How quaint, feet!
Okay but where do you find edible pigeons?????
I’m totally gonna hunt pigeons at the train station 😂😂😂 use chips as bait
Words...  I can't...
Oooffff No wonder those upperclass people never got a break from the gout.
its chick hunting season already aww man I'll never find a guy worth my time
I wanted to see more of what the inside looked like when it was done.
This channel is amazing, is funny that all ancient good dishes have Portuguese liquors
What exactly are truffles?
I just adore her accent!  😗
Was ok until the feet were added!
oh my!!! grabbin the pellet gun and headed to the overpass....looks amazing
So basically that's the original chicken pot pie?
I hope she doesn't do a beef pie..
"Add some feet".. Lol.
Why didn’t you cut it open 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
You know... it kinda looks like that cake from "Don't hug me I'm scared"
I freaking love the weirdness of the Victorians 🤣 those feet were still shocking though....
i dont know why this bothered me but it bothered me.
Alien 7, with the all new Pigeon Pie Chestburster..
What a pie, and the slice must be like a doorstop! But it did look so succulent and quite delicious! Bravo, Mrs Crocombe!
No condiments!!
I think this dish is perfect on a frosty autumn day
Those legs on the top ??? Hmmm creepy 8\
Those whole cloves are gonna be an ordeal.
You lost me with the feet.. no ma'am
now that was one nasty recipe... everything was going good til the pigeon meat in quail eggs that look gross
dude, this is cool
Hmmm.. Wonder why she didn’t taste it? 🤢
Great video, but let's say this is not the recipe for me. Also I don't know why but I noticed a breadcrumb in the salt! :D
Jeoffry baratheon’s nightmare!
I find her incredibly attractive, love her neck
What a beautiful lady. A true representation of English beauty.
let me see.. ok I can almost make it, i do have salt
“How to make pigeon pie” 
Uhhh can’t we just ordereth pizza sisth 😭💀💀💀💀
Usually when you make pies the meat is always half cooked but it is raw here...I hope it is enough to cook all that meat
Everyone is hating on the feet... But where are the spices 😭. It looks pretty though
I always like this program, but I wouldn't even try to eat that lol
People today are eating a lot of disgusting things (flavours made from mold,a lot of chemical and artifical stuff,in some countries even human hair is used to make bread ....) and freak out by a decoration made of natural pigeon feet.
Crazy world !!!
Is there a vegan version of this?
Almost curious about the flavor
I had to go to burger king
Neat looking pie. Not sure I would like the insides.
Looking very delicious
Thank God I am in modern era
Looks delicious.  I must give that a try.  I love pigeon.
Feet??  Seriously???  FEET????
0:40 Am I the only one who thinks that Joffrey would come and slide the pie with his sword?
She's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal
I'd rather have pigeon pie without the pigeon with some capers added.
Well, that's what they get for teaching Snotface how to do it. Fred warned them. (Any 80's babies around?)
how do you come up with a recipe till you gotta add feet to it
..I think y'all forgot the background music and echo cancellation?
Was alright but left me a bit peckish.
I think tastes have changed, looks greasy to me.
Can I substitute rats for the pidgeons and antifreeze for the whiskey?
Something really light.
People disturbed at the idea of eating pigeon (a free-range, lean, healthy meat that has a natural diet before it is shot) apparently not put off by the horrific conditions that most commercially produced chickens endure before it is pumped full of water and salt prior to being sold! Fixating on the feet?! Your KFC bones, chinese sticky rib bones, t-bones on a steak, mechanically produced pepperoni on a pizza - that's all normal and fine, right? LOL
Am I the only 1 who almost passed out when she put the feet in 🤮
NO SALT!!!
Does the guest of honor at the hunt get to enjoy the pigeon feet?  It is rather like splitting the wishbone on a turkey.  Great video!
Wonderful! <3
Sing a song of sixpence a pocket full of rye...
При просмотре ролика я как буд-то побывала во временах старой Англии. Чудесно передана атмосфера! Рецепт интересный для меня, так как в моей стране не едят голубей 😊
4:00 SQUELCH 🙄
Don't really care for the music !
I love Mrs. Crocombe!!! <3 <3 <3
the actress has confessed she's not a cook. i'll bet the director has made her a better one thru the course of this series.
i know  this one, it was on games of throne
I would love for a Victoria sub to serve me this!
You had me until the feet bit...
" quick lunch " 😂😂😂
I love your videos! =D Please keep up this amazing work!
That actually looks delicious to me 😸😂
Pigeon meat? Where can I find it?
All the people are talking about the feet but I stopped at truffles
the feet tho LMAO
Ah!  Comes with its own toothpicks.
Doesn't look that hard to be honest you just chuck everything in.  Warts n all.
No you did not just stick some crusty old pigeon feet into that pie!!
This is the Victorian Timpano and you can't tell me otherwise.
Tweety bird is triggered.
it was all fun and games until...

she added those feet😂
日本語字幕をつけて頂いてありがとうございます。
Oh God,  how am I going to look at pigeons in park now?
Y’all already know no ones doing this lmao
OH GOD THE FEET
Mike Tyson has left the chat.
That's the most hearty and meatiest food I've ever seen. Looks so delicious.
I'd skip the birdy feet and put in lots of bacon and cheese....mmmm
rest in peace pigeons :,(
I’m so jealous i want all these pretty moulds they use in this show!
I have never been less ready for a comment than "-I think I'll add some feet."
Oh my god, there really are pigeons
nightmare for one coming up!
That cross section puts Babish to shame
My husband would love the pigeon pie feet and all except for the crust. Great video! Thank you!
y’all keep going on about the feet but I’m still trying to figure out how she got like $500 worth of truffles.
The English are a different species omfg
Why am I watching this at 12:20 pm?
Better question how did I find this video after only watching videos with zuko from Atla for the past few hours
Funny the actress didnt really cooked until she started doing this videos. She is amazing.
That looked horrendous.
Food corporations be like: no pigeons were harmed during this monstrosity~ 🕺🏻
I never once thought of pigeon, quail eggs, or pigeon feet as being appetizing; but this lady knows how to make it all look good.
Who else realized that they have literally only the have the spices
That's a "light lunch"??? Compared to what?
Arya Stark must have watched this before making her pies lol
Wait...you can eat pigeons ?
aww man i thought it was a pie for the pigeons
girl but the feet though ?
I was almost onboard until the eating it cold part came up. I'd need a bit of relish or perhaps mustard to even fathom eating this cold.
Wow!  I'll have a large helping, please!  :-)
Oh God...not the feet!
What type of truffles was that???
Adding pegion legs.... Well, appetite gone forever.
uuuurrrrrrrrrrrrgh...........I'll just have some Cinnamon Toast Crunch please
oh girl kinda stacked!
Don't turn your noses up at pigeons, they're good eating.  It was one of the reasons we domesticated them in the first place.  Back in the day, my friends and I used to shoot them with BB guns and roast them over an open fire.  Or we would raid a pigeon nesting site under a bridge for squabs.  Trust me, it was some fine eating......
I'm sure the pie is absolutely beautiful, but all I can look at are those little toasted pigeon feet.
@emmymadeinjapan you need to recreate this ! @emmymadeinjapan !
Nothing pure away from pain
That was so unusual in every possible way.
When I watch these, it really gets my creativity going.. I would love to do this recipe, but substitute for the pigeon with chicken meat from the indonesian all black.. with it's black meat and call it 4 and 20 black birds...
I wonder if Arya will make a cooking video abt her Frey Pies...
Nice crunchy feet😂
Any salt??
Reminds me of a timpano 😂
She said “since it’s pigeon pie I should add some feet” like it’s the most common thing in the world
Good thing it wasn't a beef pie: those hooves would be harder to keep in place.
Would love to see how you would cut into this, serve, and taste it!
Wow, that was interesting.
These are such delightful videos🌸
I have grown tired of the Comanche attacks on my longhorn ranch, so I am taking the next steam packet to this magical land where people eat pigeon and live in manor houses...Narnia, is it called?
the pigeon was a turn off.
Brb. Going to the park to murder a bunch of birds.
I........'m not sure this dish would be appetizing by today's standards....
Pigeon breast is a lot darker than I thought it would be
The garden seems like AOV arena
Why did they use whiskey in so many recipes back in the day?
Salt and pepper for the meat..?
Stunning
This day has been made!!! Love Mrs. Crocombe!!
I sHOUld aDD sOMe fEeT
Lol I was with you until you added the feet! lol Yikes!!
Pigeon?  What next?
I think watching her add these feet must have turned a lot of people vegan....ew...
ıt feels like inside of the pie is not cooked enough.
I just love your videos ....they bring me such Joy.... I just found out that I have a little bit of English Ancestry....I have celebrating and honoring my English Ancestry by learn more about history and different time periods.... and I love the Victorian era as well
Aw poor little pigeon feet😭
was hoping for a better cross section of the pie afterwards lol was really curious to see all the layers and how it the meat cooked through.
Oof feet aside that looks very good
 too bad a peasant like me will never ecpirence something that great
Some seasoning would have been great 😁
Honestly this recipe just looks terrible, just a bunch of expensive meats shoved into a pie, the seasoning was added over the damn trouffles for peet's sake 😂 who seasons trouffles??
Noooope! She lost me at pigeons.
Yes you had me till, the feet... but I'm thinking "four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie" will now bring this to mind ...
🤮🤮🤢🤢THIS IS NOT FOR ME 🤢🤢🤮🤮
Joffrey Baratheon wants to know your location
I'm vegan but I have to say, at least the pigeons weren't factory farmed, and like chicken who lived a miserable short life, the light on them 24/7 to make them lay constantly, their feet growing to the wire, and shot with hormones and antibiotics.
I suppose it is a slow oven
Work me like one of your pastries~
Oh... dude, I can't.
I thought she was going to make bird footprints on the pie.
Fcn PIGEONS!!!
The inside of that pie looks like a horror movie.
Diabetes in a pie XD
I feel nauseous after seeing this...
Strange 😂
It all sounded pretty good until the little feet, then "Aaaauuuuggghhh!"
I feed pigeons. I don't eat them ever..EVER!
This reminds me so much of Jake’s Sandwich from Adventure Time for some reason 😂
My young kids love this series, but I think they'll skip out on this one, lol
Omg eeew poor pigeons
IT'S LIKE A TIMPANO
Looks awful but must be tasty, somehow four the truffles.
I dont know if it's because I'm from NYC and I see them all the time, but I can't see myself eating pigeon. Sure we may joke about the chicken wings in chinese restaurants being pigeon wings, but the thought of eating a pigeon makes me nauseous
For some reason I don't think she enjoys making some of the dishes.
I feel the same on the addition of feet. Ick. Up til then I was ok😏
I can afford the salt and the mushrooms...is that enough to make a successful pigeon pie?
I'm so addicted to this channel now
Clearly not for the average person as truffles are just to expensive. So how tf can you afford truffles but not chicken or turkey
I love Mrs. Crocombe and will happily watch any video with her, but this recipe truly grossed me out to be honest.

Still,  it's very interesting how English Heritage makes the Victorian times come back to life ❤
St Hilda
why she make me hard
Eeewww!!..😳🤭😱
Imagine making this with nyc pigeons lmao
The pigeon feet almost took me out! Its interesting to see how this dish is very gamey and heavy.
Pigeon is yummy when cooked well
seriously? feet?
I'm trying to figure out why did she hold her fingers on top of the pie repeatedly...THEN to make it worse...after she went through ALL of that prep & decorating she put the MESSIEST,gaping hole in the pie to vent instead of a nice cross split or straight line down the middle😆
Is this how the timpano was born?
But does it have a soggy bottom? 😜
....the feet..😭😭😭😭
She uses a lot of padding. I am not talking about the pastry sides here.
Joffrey Baratheon has left the chat...
Gimme a slice! 😋😏
i need these every week
I was expecting pigeons to fly out of it. Is it just me?
Interesting. But are you really sure that someone would eat that bloody pigeon breast + pigeon-feet-stuff voluntarily? ? ?
you mean Flying Rat Pie.
Where I'm from we have dove season and you can hear gun shots all day makes for good eating
Why did I read this as "how to make a pigeon die"
So calming... ☺️
was this real catched pigeons
Nothing brings out the taste of meat like more meat.
Before there were clean and greasy pigeons raised for the sole purpose of ending in our plates, just as sheeps and chickens. And today they've become dirty animals anyone feed.
You can see the meat she uses is ure quality, it must be delicious
The godess of cooking
I love your chanel  :D
when she put the feet on i lost it
My grandmother used to call a dog that was of mixed lineage a "Faust" — but I take it that it's not like your Faust meat...
I love all your videos. This however not that much. It looked a bit raw and those pigeon feet are..um.peculiar. but i guess people back then love it
Very fancy food! Only ham and ground beef for me!
p-pigeon feet...
I’d like to know what a certain Mr. Ramsay would have to say about this lol
I was so unprepared for the feet
A new video from this channel just made my entire day!!
Okay, so hold all the ingredients except for the whiskey and pass me a serving.
Honestly I love this channel so much, the comment section is always the funniest and purest place of the internet haha
Pigeon...paloma...uaskkkkkk😢😢😢😢no please no
Thanks Mrs. Crocombe, I hate it.
我哭了，英国人民太可怜了，吃的都是啥玩意儿啊
I never knew that baby cows, pigeons and quail eggs were a good combination.
i died at the feet bit
So disappointed that we couldn't view the inside. No voila here.
Why all the fuss about the feet?
You’re all (presumably) ok with eating chicken leg meat off the bone, but a pigeon foot suddenly has you feeling sick? Oookayyy.
Pigeons like the flying rats in the city ?? Those pigeons? Blarf
Joffrey approved
Seems kinda bland to me
Reminds me of game of thrones lol
As soon as I hear the English Heritage theme song and see Mrs. Crocombe, my heart is a flutter and all is right with the world.
Epic meal time
How tf do you eat this tho ew
I'm going to vore that bloody feet. Mrs. Crocombe worked hard so to thank her, I'll take the entire stock!
Go vegetarian!
Thumbs up for Mrs. Crocombe! 👍
Let's put a cute little tarantula made by pigeon feet in the hole to bring a nice kick of fun by scaring the shooters in the lunch time!
I thought the top was garnished with walnuts...I was so terribly wrong.
do you guys eat everything you make on the show cos I probably wouldn't be able to eat that. but I swapped out the pigeon for chicken breast
Completely vile 🤢🤮
This was hard to watch...
That’s it, I want to meet Maryann she’s a great prepper
This would taste really good with all those herbs and spices!
🕊+🥧=🤮
Sad that salting your meat wasn't as much of a thing back in the day. It probably would have improved a lot of food
Why is everybody here hating on the feet?!😂😂😂 it's just decoration not meant for consumption(i think)
I guess the feet were unnecessary!
Pigeion??? No thanks
Ah no seasoning on the meat!
Sometimes I wish she try it at the end lol
Dang this is one boujee pie, veil, truffles, pigeon, and quail eggs
They should show how the pie looks after cutting
Where do you get those feet from?? I never thought you would put real feet at pies
...why didnt she season the meat first...yucky. no flavour
That stuff doesn't even looked cooked
I adore this Chanel so muchh,  everythingg is High quality made and soo beautifully presented . Definitelyy à subb forever..  Keep plz doing more vidéos of this era
Mmmm, feet.  They're the best bit.  I could just eat a few right now but I've run out.
I'm here for the comments about the feet & the comments about the feet comments.  😂  Good god those feet are going to haunt me for the rest of my life.
"Look! The pie!"
Refuses to comment as a vegetarian
This is like English tempano
I honestly think this stuff is so cool
Wait. Leaves? I thought it was going to look like feathers...0.0
oh Jesus the feet
Love it ! Do not forget everybody that at this time, cooking decoration was very différent ! I'm not shock by the pigeon feet, it make me smile lol ! Being french those videos are changing my point of view about english food !
日本語字幕がついて本当に嬉しい
Eeeewwwww!
drain the blood from pigeon breast. ATLEAST :(
Why does the salt look like sugar in the beginning of the video?
More like a 3 meat pie
Looks tasty and healthy. :) Good source for proteins and not to much carbs or any sugar. ^^
Will Joffrey choke on it if he ate  it?
I find these series more interesting than cooking shows on TV.
British grand Tampino
I have to sleep, why am I watching this?
salt was never in the chat
Aside from the morbid addition of bird feet, food back  then looked so rich and tasty. Washing up must have been a nightmare
I was already taken aback by the pigeon breast and then she said “we’ll add the feet” honey-
todo va bien, los ingredientes caros, los que puedes intercambiar por algo mas economico... pero ponerle las pinches patas arriba....no mamen jajaja
This looks like Arya Stark made that.
Forcemeat sounds so threatening
oohwee this aint it mrs crocombe
Just discovered Mrs. Crocombe and have binge-watched all her videoes since I'm sick in bed... And I love her! She seems like a proper lady, who's proud of her job.
Chef Ramsey who??? 😂😂😂
Who else eat pigeon.....?!😅😅😓😓no offense i was a bit traumatized...😓😓😅😅😓
A recipe for the rich & gluttonous, enough to bring about a heart attack 🤓
The younger people think all meat comes off a styrofoam tray.   Food is food.  If you were hungry enough you'd be gnawing gratefully on those chicken feet.
the meat was still raw 😷
p-pigeon ??
This recipe makes me terribly sad
"I shall just add some feet"--ah yes, the perfect, very appetizing garnish, of course. 
Lol it's so interesting to see how fashions change through history
Lets be real maam it’s ideal to kill Joffrey
🥺 no me parece apetitoso!
All hail the meat cylinder!
Intresting
Y después dicen que los peruanos somos repugnantes porque comemos paloma!! 😂
that cross section looks like a bosch hellscape
Ohh why the feet?
Reminds me of a better life i had when I was born into a rich family
Reminds me of jeffrey baratheon
Chelsea Winter could never
Why the feet tho
...and to think that such birds are now considered  nuisances on every restaurant corner.
I don’t think they sell the key ingredients at my local Ralph’s Super Market.
I would not eat that for the life of me.
Not hating, but how does one even get pigeon meat?
we stan our queen mrs crocombe
it's like watching a car crash
id like to see her pies
Good tidings to you  Mrs. Crocombe!   I enjoyed this one more than the .. turbot fish. Though I did like its copper pan.  Always a pleasure to hear your voice.
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

Great vid though!
Why did she add FEET???
That looked not bad until she put the feet in there
This is very strange to me 'pigeon pie', but the way you prepared it, I would try it.
Half of my family is British, so seeing this really helps me learn about my heritage. I can't wait to visit England. I even sometimes have the accent and not knowing where it came from. People always tell me that generations skip and I believe it has skipped towards me. I am proud to have British blood in me. I love England and I actually love several things that are British. The day I visit England, will be the day I have one of my dreams come true. Plus, I have never had Pigeon but this looks delicious. My British great grandmother has rubbed off on me lolz
Is it safe (or even legal) to use city pigeons for this? And where does one find truffles?
For some reason, chicken feet seems okay, but pigeon feet? 🤢
I'm happy to see her! I'm always waiting for her recipes)
a shame that i never had pigeon before i wonder why here in America that it's not apart of the birds we eat
Idk about this lol
This..gusting
7:23
Wait wait wait wait are we talking about the same pigeons because I didn't know people actually eat pigeons!
Pigeons are actually sooo good
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I wonder if a toe nail fell in the pie
Yum. That pie would cost a fortune here in the US. The feet are awesome.
Is this really good? 😝
I was into it until you added the feet
Is it just me or is she scaring us all
🤢🤮
no thanks.
7:22  Nooo...!! 😖🤢😖
omg. feet. the food has feet. 😱
No salt?
I really need that cooker plus the castle (or at least the kitchen).
My cats enjoyed this video immensely; when she added the feet as a garnish, I laughed and my cat, Frank, gave me this withering stare as if to say, “THAT’S THE BEST PART, HOOMAN”
Pigeon Pie Feat. Feet
this was fine until the very end when she threw that curveball that this would be served cold
unable to speak due to excessive drooling 🤤
sky rat pie
man...lasagna has come a long way
Looks good
All those ingredients COLD don't sound very appetizing, but I'd sure give it a try.
This actually looks so delicious! With the spices and broth and whiskey. I love cooking different cuisine! I never clicked on a video so fast!! 💕💕
Feet: it's what's for dinner.
GOD no wonder people were dying of diarrhea
I have a question- with all the meats, mushrooms, and liquids in there, why isn’t the bottom soggy? And the sides for that matter?
Until the feet happened, I thought the comments would focus on Mrs Crocombe’s dislike of weak sides.
I will bet there is no Soggy Bottom here
Are those real pigeons?
No wonder they all got gout.
is this real
Not one drop of seasoning in that meat  🤕🤧 AND WHERE THE HELL DO YOU BUY PIGEON BEAST 😩💀
Lol a vegans nightmare
The comments here are the best ever!!!! Lol!!!
The pigeon breasts looked so scary
Loved the video, but still no to the pie
Ohhh YES!!!  What a great way to start my day with a new Victorian Way video! <3
I though scotland people doesnt eat pigeon..now i know...
The meat didn’t even look cooked
I love her
Looks good except the mushrooms
wait wh0 she talkin to
🤮🤮🤮
Are the feet in the top of the pie like getting a horse's head in your bed?
never mind the feet, the lead poisoning from the tin will kill you first.
Thought it was just a name until I saw the actual pigeons
ion know bout this one ms crocombe
Yuuuuuuuuckkkkk mann
Once I tried a piece of a tradicional  English pie in London and It was one of the worst things I ever tried in my life. This one seems to be similarly terrible.
Would a cows pie need hooves stick out of it?   :)
vegans have left the chat
Is she really using piegon meat? Like for real? Can you eat piegon? Like isn't that against the law?
Its 9mins. And it feels like 2 mins. Wth
7:18 when i say i yelled...
.        Yay it's Mrs. Crocombe      👍👍👍
Them feet tho imagine humans feet
Paraguay culture
Never!
"Pigeon breast and feet... Eeeew!" Said someone while eating a 50 cents burger made of... meat? and a side dish of nuggets made of chicken byproduct, all served with a soda with 150 chemicals and  70 grams of sugar... Sigh
There's no salt??
Anyone please answer!
No thanks.
She is hot😍
Beautifully done.  In times when these were made large estates had dovecots that were the size of sheds or larger and they housed many pigeons.  I always wondered what they used the meat for and where I live they still shoot pigeons in September/Oct.  I know this because they all come to my house since we feed them NOT shoot them.
you call it heritage, we call it culture
Do the British know that pigeons are nothing but flying rats?
Señora, el mejor aceite es el virgen extra ESPAÑOL, seguro que sus platos serían doblemente valorados si los utilizara, pruébelo y ya verá cómo le deja de apretar tanto ese corsé que lleva, madammmmmmm,
🤢
Yuhh subscribed
Ahhh I can hear the Vegans sing a song of horror to this video ~~
Is it really pigeon meat???
What an intersting time area we live in!!! Imagine in a few years, be dressed like in Victoria time and moving in a self-driving cars
No salt added?
This has meat from three different animals in it.
hahahaha the feet!
the English really had to make do, didn't they?
Can anyone explain what it tastes like?
🤢
Interesting . . . and strange!  I think I'll pass!
한국에 있는 비둘기를 무료로 드리겠습니다!
마지막에 발 꽂는거 보고 놀랬음 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
닭발인가 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
근데 간 되어 있는게 햄 밖에 없는데 싱겁지 않을까요
I didn't know poeple can eat pigeons
She forgot to add a generous dose of cement and plaster of Paris.
Does anyone know what temperature
Do you eat the pigeon feet too?
i'm not put off by any of the ingredients, just VERY CONCERNED THAT NOTHING NOT A THING NOT A SINGLE THING HAS BEEN SEASONED WITH SALT AND PEPPER BEFORE ADDING TO THE PIE crying
Oh why, why the feet?
um pigeons? no thanks
Such a modern knife....
You had me up until, “pigeon breast.”
Now to shoot those dang ring neck doves. They are an invasive species and I have been looking for recipes. Not going to stick the feet in though. The other recipe I found was with garlic and lime, skewered and bbq’d
What temperature?
So that is where all the passenger pigeons went!
The feet look like a spider is trying to crawl out!
Why isn't the pigeon meat drained f blood like we do with chicken?
I am a gluten sensitive vegetarian why am i watching this before bedtime
Well this pie better have tasted amazing with how much truffles they used it must have cost them a fortune to make hope it was worth it
That's a lot of dead animals for a single pie
is that pigeons dip in blood
The whole dish looks pretty disgusting, even without the pigeon feet.
My son saw this and said who would eat that anyway 😂
Yack.....
Great, now I have another YouTube crush. Doesn't help she looks like Audrey Plaza, another crush of mine
That’s a good once a year or two year special occasion meal.
Y’all colonized India for centuries and didn’t  add spices to your bland meals smh 😂😂😂
Hell naw
Has anyone ate this recently?
I am asian but  after I watched a few of this videos, I started parading around the house with grace and dignity. . Didn't come as a shock when I heard dad telling mom if they could make me come see some specialist. .
Squab is what you call pigeon right?
feet of pigeon..?? like really??😕
Someone call police I know she did not just use pigeon feet to garnish goddamn meat pie
I'm sure this tastes alright while still warm, but it seems like it'd be absolutely disgusting cold.
I wanna go to work dressed like that.
it looks soo bloodthirsty!!
To my modern American mind this pie is perhaps one of the most intriguing and horrific things I've ever seen. I mean it's almost perfectly ghastly. But having said all that I am dying to know what it tastes like. Keeping in mind of course it would have been room temperature or cooled, and there would have been a gelatin aspect with the liquid binding everything together. Still. I eat it if I got half a chance. Thank you Mrs. C for dropping in to my own horrific ghastly week. This was a nice surprise... Sort of. Those pigeon feet though.
Everybody gangsta till she puts feet on the pie
The feet, I just can't even!  I don't remember the last time I have laughed so hard!  Can you imagine this pie with its little pigeon feet being served today!
jeffrey baratheon doesn't like this video
Sallt? Pepper?onion
I don't know why people are going off about the feet! Why'd you not have feet? Bird feet have flavors packed in them!
She forgot the salt
Grees C
Weird looking lasagna.
what is this for
This ones a no from me, just as much as finding a recipe for squirrel is a no for me. However, I am now curious of how you’d bake 40 black birds in a pie! Can we do that one?
She lost me with the feet....
i kinda don't like this one
Forget the feet that's okay.. where's the salt!!!!!?? It's MEAT and hardly any salt😕😕
Gordan ramsay has left the chat
why is it never seasoned?
Who's here for her accent?
Pigeons👏🏼sound 👏🏼so👏🏼gross👏🏼
this is why the british should be oppressed
Just going to add this to the list of things to not eat when I visit the UK as a generic run-of-the-mill American I could assure you that I would most likely vomit upon eating this

I am sure it’s delicious for those who have been exposed to these meats and flavors throughout their lifetime but you smacking pigeon pork and veal and truffles with the feet you lost me I’ll just go make your chocolate pudding 😂

Just gonna eat my McNuggets
Background music name please ?
:0
OMG Poor pigeons :(
Thank god we don't live in these times anymore and therefore don't have to make this or use this meat. 😱
I ate a dish in Cairo once, which is called pigeon in its coffin, with crunchy head and all, cooked in a bed of deliciously flavoured rice. Quite tasty it was too.
I am so confused if this is a spoof or not
Why, oh why, did I watch this right before going to bed? I'm going to have nightmares of pigeon feet crawling out of my pie. I'm a glutton for punishment...or pigeon breasts...or something like that.
🤮
When u massacred thousands of people, invaded countries, and oppressed people for years for spices, and then u can’t season ur food properly lol
Gout attack
Soooo they didn't believe in rinsing off their Meat?
Is that where the mother goose nursery rhyme originated from?
Great actress
Dang, thats a lot of meat, where I'm from PETA would get it banned for life, although, I am very impressed at how chefs in the victorian era conserved and used. As for me well, I'll stay away from this recipe, makes me a bit nauseous.
Oh no baby what is you doin. You’re wrong for that
did she say "add some feet"???? 😂
How do you eat such a tall pie? How do you even cut it lol
Why didn’t you cut open the pie
I like these videos. But, not this. I know pigeon is a flying bird? But we don’t formally eat those as a flying fowl.🤨 We stick with chicken and turkey and duck and maybe goose. I guess those weren’t plentiful enough during the time this video represents...😯
Although, I have seen quails in rose water sauce.... with a chocolate topping... 🤔🤷🏽‍♀️
Scary
it seems like a panneton
I would like you to cut it at least, to see how it is inside...but...yeah
What about the salt??????!!!!!!
Truffles ? Holy Moses , I'd better take out a mortgage ! Pigeons are so pesky , they leave nothing for our small birds on the feeding trays . However , I'm not impressed with this recipe . Most folk , unless inundated with large amounts of cash couldn't possibly afford to make it . I love these videos , however , please , in future , allow reality in our present day to include some sensibility . 👵🏼
What no almonds tut tut this will not do .
I'll pass...
Poor pigeons
I would do a modern version of this but with the following changes:

1.  Mix the stuffing ingredients instead of layering them and cook them separately before stuffing in the pie and baking the whole thing.

2.  Substitute chicken for pigeon meat.  And omit the ham if the meat is chicken.  I just prefer limiting dishes to one meat.
OMG is that blood ?
So disgusting  I find English food so gross no flavor to it whatsoever in Pigeon 🤢
Congratulations. How thing have changed! When I was in England (in the 1960s), I was told people were forbidden to kill pigeons and eat their flesh. I was even warned by a silly woman against patronizing Chinese restaurants because they were rumoured to pass pigeon for chicken! I told her that was quite surprising because in the rest of the world pigeons are more expensive than chickens.
no
This makes me wish the car pooping varmints out my window is safe to eat.
no cross section? no tasting?
no salt or pepper huh, HOW BLAND WAS THIS????
i wonder if this is why people didnt live long back in those days, eating pigeon pie like that...
Ugh Mrs Crocombe is THAT girl, ICONIC theme song, she is SHADY and she knows how to throw down in the kitchen!!!
What am I doing here, I am vegan, and Brazilian. It's the 6th video I am watching. Just can't stop, someone help me please
It looks like the bird is trying to claw its way out of the cake...
Neat
Passenger pigeons were hunted to extinction for food like this :(
I better not get on Mrs Crocombes bad side
Feet... FEET!!! Who's going to eat the feet?!
Why has no one mentioned that her accent came and went? That was hard to listen to.
I will skip the pidgeon in favor of chicken and the quails eggs for chicken eggs.
She forgot the salt?
Where do you buy pigeons???
The meat looked pink still 😔
Why don't you cut a slice so we can see the inside?
Wait so, no ones gonna taste it?
Жесть... как его есть вообще...
How many people eat pigeons nowadays?
Is this the same pigeon pie that was showed in the game of thrones?
I think I’m gonna throw up...and I haven’t eaten all night
Why is salt an ingredient when you didn't even season the meat with it?
Whew! For a minute there I thought it was going to be a feet-less pigeon pie. But Mrs. Crocombe is a connsummate professional.The second she poked those little feet into the pie, I breathed a sigh of relief and my world was right again.
Where do I get hold of a mold like that? I want it soooo bad!
Cucumber n feet !!! Great
My mother and I would to see The Victorian way to make Steak and kidney pie. after seen this pie.
I felt feetless for a second
I want to go out with the cook :) she’s pretty
I'll pass
These 18 century recipes gross me out sometimes, they’re so overloaded and very strange. Like who came up with putting pigeon breast, veal, ham, quail eggs, and put it in a pastry shell?

I would strip this recipe down to just the pigeon breast, maybe marinade in the herbs and spices, sauté with the mushrooms, then add a little flour in the pan, make with the stock and have a pan gravy. And maybe bake some bread to mop up that gravy.

Simple.
Hi beach
This does not look yummy :(
I bet you could fit a couple of Freys in one of those pies.
those truffles look tinned is that even a thing
woww
omg...
NASTYYYY
Weird
Yuck
Nooo..
Why is the pigeon meat so bloody?
"Just add some feet." Gross.
THE FEET THE GELATINOUS PIGEON FILLING THAT WAS DEFINITELY STILL RAW AFTER ONLY 1.5 HRS OF COOKING SO MANY THINGS TO BE HORRIFIED ABOUT
wAIT YOU EAT THAT THING COLD ?
Why have we stopped eating pigeons?  They are everywhere
It looks like a meat panettone!
Why pour in stock/gelatin after it has cooled as opposed to before baking?
She didnt even taste it 😂 shes scared to choke on those pigeon feet haha
Its fake truffels...
I don’t think I’d ever be able to eat pigeon meat...🤢
I can’t even with this.
Bruh
nice to see a fancy dish for my cat
Must try it
No wonder they suffered from bouts of Gaut.
WoWww!!!!
Kids we can eat Mace XD
Why
Yummy
Mąka jest niezdrowa
Low-key grossed out that its PIGEON MEAT actual pigeon
이게 바로 닭둘기 사용법
Looks like a real meat cake😧
Cover yourself up you hussy!
This is the strangest cooking show I've ever seen...
Did they actually just put pigeons' feet in the pies back in the day when they made this?
W życiu bym tego nie tknęła
I would not eat any of that. A bunch of unseasoned meat.
At last the feet thing kinda gross
I think the pigeon breast is not washed. It's has still some blood in it.
Does it come with free strangler? Oops, wrong era.
What kind of accent is this ? What accent does she speak
Well that looks disgusting :D I'll give it a pass!
What am I, a vegetarian doing here....
I wouldn't eat that if you paid me 50 million dollars. Ok I would. But not for $100.00
I wonder how does it taste😥
Uncooked watercress will give you flukes!
As big as this "pie" turned out to be, it makes me wonder how does one go about tucking into it. One portion would have enough to serve two to three people at least.
Just watched a video about pie in medieval times and discovered that the pastry was disposed of, not eaten, as it was literally just the disposable serving container that made the food inside portable. I wonder if it was the same during Victorian times, or if by then they'd made the pastry tasty.
This pie is really high though. I wouldn't know how to cut pieces out of it that are small enough to actually be edible! Usually when I make cake-shaped meals like pie or quiche I just cut them like I would cut a cake but that one seems a bit... massive for doing that. O.o
Why are ppl are so concerned with the feet?
😮😍🍴
Omg that looks disgusting, every step was disturbing.  😳
what if i was vegan during victorian era?
I’m sorry, but GROSS!
Americans need to start eating pigeons too; we have too many pigeons here.
I'm salty, why was there no salt
wtf
OMG, everyone looks up "Mrs Crocombe" on Google and see what pops up!!!! YEEEES!
I love this woman videos but this one made me throw up in my mouth a little.
God dam, what a Woman!  Oh was there a pie there somewhere.
I love watching this channel it’s fascinating.  Being a professional pastry chef, I love the mold.  I’m sorry there’s no way in hell I’m eating pigeon!   I’m from Brooklyn, NY to me Pigeons are nothing more than rats with wings!
It looks like a horror movie when you cut into it
How old is she
Nice
I applaud the creativity, but this looks like it tastes awful.
Ogggh the feet 😩😡 and the eggs😳
Came here after seeing pigeon pie on Game of Thrones and thought "Ohh that looks nice"... after watching this ...never mind hahaha. Her presentation, the ambience and mood was dull and off putting. Would actually love to see Mary Berry make a pigeon pie!! 🙏
I'd rather die than eat this
How exactly we gonna get some Quail eggs. And even more notable. How we going to get truffles?
Chicken pot pie? You mean PIGEON pot pie.
I'm 9.5.weeks pregnant, and although I've been terribly nauseous, I hadn't thrown up. Until I watched this video, that is. I love this channel, but that is about the nastiest meal I can imagine. All those strong flavors competing with each other. Sky rat feet. A dish of blod sloshing around. 😷
I'm a little iffy on the veal, I'd rather not support that. :x
I think it should have a longer cooking time. Looks a little too raw after a piece is cut out of it. Under cooked anything with poultry is risky. NO feet please!
I love watching these videos, but EEWWW this looks gross!
After eating this pie I  fought a tiger with my bare hands, dragged an elephant up the hill. Still some calories left.
I'm really confused about the cooked ham in the forcemeat. Can this be a misinterpretation and raw minced ham (the cut from the bag of a pig) should be used in stead?
can you push your glasses up a little bit
Looks raw inside... possibilities to get salmonella..
yooooooooo this is fuckibng DOPE I'm subscribing
Я бы такое не ела!
I'm sorry but that looks utterly disgusting 🤢🤮
when those hard times fall and you run out of food and it's the end of the world and there's an outbreak or disease.....I'll eat it
Forget the feet and let's talk about the salt!
How in the heck did I get here YouTube???? 😂🤣😁💖
No offence, but that looks disgusting
The bowl of sort from which she was taking chicken breasts still had ALOT of blood in it I think and thats making me nauseous af!! And after reading the comments, I don't think anybody else sees it or is bothered by it.....
How did watching cringe videos get me here? Ah yes, the feet in the pie
About your ci,me tell about the feet:  in Victorian times, they deliberately included the feet, the head and ears and tail, everything, in the finished presentation.  Nowadays, people don't want to know which animal it came from, they sing want to see body parts, but back then it was considered important.  Even in Queen Victoria's time, the whole animal was served on the platter.
My concern is the pigeon breasts not being washed..
So she really put whole cloves in there. 😁
WAY too much cloves!  You only need two or three piece for something that size!
I should just add some feet.
Does she actually live in that huge mansion? 🤔
Fyi: before anyone asks, I just found this channel today, so I know nothing about it other than her name, and the style of cooking she does.
Listen. I hate pigeons. But not that much. Poor babies.
Barf.
Breh, why am I watching this?
Indians will never touch this awawful food..... Wonder how Britishers ruled us so long
I swear, I really love United Kingdom but their food is very weird and not at the least delectably.
Where do you even get safe to eat pigeons nowadays? You can't just shoot some at your local park, surely. It'll scare the hell out of the old people feeding them, if nothing else.
WTF YALL EAT PIGEONS AND THERE FEET 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤣
No offense but that looks disgusting bro
I like it but without the pegion breast. Use chicken instead
I like "The Victorian Way" in general but this pie looked disgusting for me, no offence.
I have to say that, that pie looks utterly disturbing
Someone pls tell me that the red stuff from the pigeon breasts was marinade and not blood
This looks so gross. omg..
I’m putting little sandals on my pies feet
it's more of a Halloween Pigeon pie.
It looks quite disgusting.
I literally felt nauseous when I saw the feet on top but I'm already under the weather so...
Loovvee these videos but this meal... A hard pass w/ feet lol 😂😱
I KNOW you did not just put pigeon feet on that pie 😂
The feet! Lmbo!!!!!!🤣🤣
This is something that would make me go vegan 🤢🤢🤢
Gordon Ramsay needs to come here as a guest character
LOOK, THE PIE!
Finally a recipe that I can use what’s just laying around in my kitchen.
The elegant music made this video seem like a sadistic parody...
I really wanted to see a cross section of it :o
🤭
Now I want to see you eat it. I’m just curious and really want to see someone eat this.
What's next, rat tail stew?
Yeah, like i just happen to have a few truffles lying around the kitchen.
Can’t stop staring at the feet....
Pigeons- fine... but veal?! That’s fucjed
Could have done without the feet garnish thank you....also the Walmart was fresh out of quail eggs and fresh pigeon parts
You can't make something like pigeon pie and not take a bite for the camera
😷😷😷😷
I never knew people on the 1700s had a camera before...hummm make sense
That's gotta be the most expensive pie ever. A bunch of specialty meats, whole truffles, multiple liquors....doubt I'll be trying this recipe at home anytime soon.
Mrs. Crocombe, you had me until pigeon feet. But bless you, all the same. I love your videos!
@vinicius Costa 
Look online 
A company called D’argatan they well ship to you
"the guns will need a tasty lunch".  I didn't know guns ate food 🤔
Me : Miss, I would love to order a pigeon pie
Chef : Okay
Me : with no feet
Chef : awe
MRS. CROCOMBE WILDIN WITH THEM FEET
RIP those poor sky rats 😭
Blerg! No thanks.
Nice, but I really wanted her to slice into it.. To see how the insides looks... I love these videos.
I was with you till you added the feet.
Is the pastry brioche?
Did she said a "cold lunch"? All of that is supposed to be served cold. I don't know about that lol.
I'm not eating a pigeon. That can't be healthy
This this really cool and sounds yummy. But do you eat the pastry? Also I heard it was served as a cold lunch? I would very much like to make some savory pies, more please! Also how do you make the pastry?
I want this as my birthday cake!!!!!
The Brits have been eating horrible food for centuries
It's so strange to see this as a Canadian, we see pigeons as the rats of the sky. When I was in Europe and China people ate pigeons and it was common. I could not get myself to try it. One day I'll have to find the courage to fight out that sky-rat stigma.
Wow she's hot!! Love me a lady like that.
Why are there eggs in a meat pie? Seems like an odd thing to include.
Welp nevermind there it is then. Thought it was absolutely disgusting and now she goes and adds dead bird feet to the top. And serve it cold?? With friggin mace?? Dear god help the stomach of whoever eats that.
This is stomach-churning 🤢 (lovely presentation though, as always)
We stan a chicken feet queen :D
How do you get anything done after eating this?
Had me til the feet
they sure had weird combos of food back in the day ...
why'd they move that veal about?
I do not have issues with the feet but that is too meaty for my taste...
The feet will haunt me.
She had Me till after the veal and ham... It actually has pigeon..lol😲
Binging With Babish didn't prepare me for the pigeon feet at all
Lol feet..
I might have missed it, but where do they add salt in this? Is it mixed with the stock and poured in? And for that size of food, the spices seem too less. Looks like it might be a bit bland for current tastes, but perfectly fine for those times. I haven't ever had truffles, so what kind of flavour does it add to the food?
So they ate it cold?? Not sure that would taste good, all that meat 😣😣😣
That abomination didn’t even looked cooked through at the end, gross.
Can you make the vegan version of this?
Are you sure this pie is sanitary?? It looks questionable to meeee!
There’s no way i stumbled across this disgusting video by accident lol
What’s she Mrs Sweeney ?
That’s the reason why Joffrey chocked to death
ewww pigeons???
This is one of my favorite web-series ever. 🤗🤗🤗
Wow I love this recipe! I just don’t know what will be harder to find, fresh pigeon or whole truffles
That's no pastry crust.
That's a God forsaken biscuit.
"I shall just add some feet."
Why!???? What did those pigeons do to piss Mrs.Crocumbe off?
Brilliant - my Sunday lunch crisis solved.  Many thanks indeed.  Cheers
Honestly didn't know pigeons could be eaten
I'm OK with the feet, but you seriously couldn't grind the cloves?!?!?
Who ate it lol??? Camera crew?
practically perfect in every way
The feet were horrible! 🤢🤮
I would have loved to have a taste of that.
the purple wedding
Eerie food...does it cook all the way through..and she does not add any salt and pepper...eeeggg..
Nice tigs
Omg who would want to eat a pigeon. WTF
wow
This is the first thing I've seen on this channel that looked disgusting.
So many animals that suffered and died for this dish. :(
The feet, Disgusting.
Pigeons? Ew.
I love the idea of the feet though I can see how it might shock the culinarily ignorant and the gastronomically challenged.
I love this channel so much, I love history and so does my adoptive dad
thank god for those mushrooms, the boys where about to get scurvy with meat, meat and meat 24/7
Ngl, I low key want to try this. It does look pretty good.
Anyone else thought that “Pigeon Pie” was just the name and that maybe it symbolizes something idk but not an actual pigeon pie 😭
this pie is to be served at the purple wedding
This looks amazing
I might trying to do this minus the feets 😂😉
So that’s what a real woman is like I love her 😍
That's one expensive pie
Ok you lost me at the feet 😳🤢 why is the breast in runny blood water?
I want every kitchen utensils AND bowls  I see in this kitchen
This looks awesome, but I have no idea where one could find pigeon to cook with (can't eat the mangy, disease-ridden urban flying rats), and trying to find a reasonably priced substitute for truffles!
Nope
Just show us the "girls", the rest is just pie.
I am obsessed with these videos. Even if some of the recipes contain meats. But this one, sorry but ... NO! What kind of witchcraft recipe is this!!?? No ma’am!
Where is the salt??
I-I’m sorry now we’ll add the what
I don’t like the idea of eating whole eggs baked into my food
i bet she's hot in real life
Aqui no Brasil não comemos pombo... Desculpe, mas acho nojento...
Oh this is quite an exotic dish but I'm not sure if I want pigeon maybe try it with chicken
I love a good hearty meat pie but this my be a little....too hearty....
Another day brightened by Avis Crocombe!
I thought it called pigeon pie because when you cut the pie... The pigeons will flying around...  Like in game of thrones
Back in the day truffles used to be a snack but now the expensive as a Lamborghini
I love this channel. I really fell in love with the mould. I wonder where I could get one too. I live in Canada I've never seen one like it.
why is this in my recommendations
Lmao i was ok until the feet god
I have had pigeon before. Is good. Also, feet tastes good tho.
You had me until the feet. Other than that, this looks fantastic.
IIRC, it was common practice to decorate the tops of these pastry dishes with some indication of its contents. So think of the feet as a sort of grotesque label.
The Lannisters disliked this video.
It was good until the feet....
I’ve watched until the end expecting to see the inside of the pie. Gutted she didn’t cut it
Interesting
Oh god, the feet... it looks like she stuffed an entire bird in there head first and the feet are sticking out. ^^° Weeeell...apart from the feet it actually looks really pretty. Massive, but pretty. 
I just wonder if the meat is cooked through. It looks still really pink in the end.
I'm a little bit shocked about the pigeon breast! I never imagined to eat it! Guess that's the beauty of cultural diversity. Anyways,  I love these videos.
Am I the only one concerned that the seasoning comes in 3 separated layers? And that she didn't just mix it into everything at the beginning? I bet a lot of that pie is unseasoned and flavourless...
Um...where do you find pigeons that haven't been exposed to rat poison and toxic garbage piles?
"As it's a pigeon pie I'll add some feet" 😨

😂😂😂
Mrs Crocombe gotta big rack. Mr Crocombe is a lucky man...
The feet made me sad 😢🕊
t h e    f e e t
that's too much meat for my liking.. yucks
Makes me wanna shoot myself a pigeon!
Honest to god thought pigeon was just a cute name for the pie. Was not expecting actual pigeons.
Is this a butterfly pie?
Some of these are sort of nightmarish.
BONE APP THE FEET
Oh I am so happy
I really want this
For me it was all going well until i saw meat. I almost vomit.
This is what they serve you in hell
...Is it me or she forgot the salt?
That was so gross it was awesome. Those feet killed it, else I might have tried it
her Victorian cooking videos make me wish I had a Victorian wife...and I'm a woman...
This... doesn't look appealing. Not. At. All.
Pigeons? Where do u even buy them eww I see them all over San Francisco surely u don't mean those dirt ones ?
Oh my goodness, I like her puppies! I would let her cook for me any time, so beautiful
And now for the feet...
Audience:  Mrs. Crocombe...NO!
Mrs. C:  Mrs. Crocombe YES!
Definitely the most unappealing Crocombe video yet, but still great.
I'd heard of pigeon pie, but I'd never seen one.   
Thank you for preparing and posting this video.  Much appreciated.
lining the pie dough with forcemeat makes a lot of sense to keep the liquids from seeping out, thanks for the video.
Ya little nasty.
Love this channel btw
The way the feet looked after the pie was cooked. 😩
Will it crumble easily in a basket ?
Ugh the recipe didn’t use any salt at all!!
I have the salt and pepper, no clue on getting the other ingredients. Looks great tho!!
you say salt but it shows sugar
I gagged
I love your video 😘
Looked pretty tasty
wunderbar 👏 👏 👏
I looks beautiful in the end but my god this has to be bland AF... salt was in the ingredients but I never saw it added to anyting. And then then the pigeon breast swimming in blood ugh, did they ever wash their meat back then ugh 😷🤢 no maam..... Again beautiful presentation but SEASON Lol
need learn with japanese ... how to show inside of the food,  cut the slice  and show in🌸
Holy crap that looks disgusting
Okay, so this is why they once said the british food is terrible.
Who eats the food that is made? Is it shared to the crew or tried to see the "taste" of victorian food
I usually LIVE for these videos and I absolutely love them BUT this one....is something esle.....
The true queen of cooking ❤️❤️❤️
She lost me soon as she said Pigeon breast. 🤢🤮
Knowing what pidgeon's feet look like in the 21st century, I think I nearly gagged.
I was with this up until the whole cloves, that sounds really unpleasant to bite into. But it looks lovely!
the cooked crispy feet!!! :(
Give me a valryian sword!! Hold the poison
The comments are hilarious! I also thought she would add in some kind of pigeon figures in pastry or something, and when she said feet... they remind me of the pigeons in the street and the local squares
Hmm feet must be very crunchy
Serious question, are the mushrooms important to making the pie turn out right (can't eat mushrooms)...(do they absorb or add moisture...or something like that)
"On shooting day" and here I was thinking it was video shooting.
What an.....Interesting choice of pie filling. Would have never thought of that myself
Yuck! Poor birdie! 😠
7:16 mmm feet
Damn that could feed three
it's like a baked meat bucket.
Yuck!!!!!
Stop Arya!
I’m surprised they could hit anything after that gravey....
I don't get force meat. Why is it called that?
This is type if pie is more common than you think.  You should scope out Great British Bake Off when they do pie week .
Inside of the pie and the decorating pigeon feet are traumatazing
You can't have week 'sides' or a weak stomach to enjoy this! Delicious! What time is supper? ;-) Another great video, as always, Mrs, Crocombe. <3
i never seen truffles like that before. Wait it looks raw D:
Y’all are killing me with the comments 😂🤣🙌😂🤣🙌😂🤣🙌😂🤣🙌😂🤣🙌
I love your channel, history but until the feet... idk if I could have the stomach for that. Chicken pie but  no feet?
What kind of truffles do they use in this? are those preserved truffles?
I don't know how I got here.  I have so many questions
Wow just wow
Such a rich and delicious looking pie! I think I’d have trouble finishing just a small slice lol.
Anyone not gonna talk about that black thing at 8:25?
Wtf! Pigion feet! Where u from? Thank God it wasn't ostrich pie!
Wow people are weaklings when it comes to the feet haha! XD some of y'all won't fair well in some parts of the world. We're too used to the "nasty" parts of animals being stuffs in hot dogs or just being thrown away which is wasteful. The life of an animal was taken for this meal, don't forget that. Even if you don't like it, just trying it won't kill you jeeze.
In my culture,whoever eats pigeons will have a horrific death,it’s considered wrong and cruel.
No wonder the Brits are famous for having shitty food, No thank you, but they do make up musically for it though.
Bye
I'm vegetarian. I don't know why I'm here...
Seems to me it would have quite a soggy bottom.
Sorry, this is gross
Is there a soggy bottom??
I ADORE the idea of these types of pies. Did she use regular pastry dough and over work it? Did I understand her correctly? I would love more information on this. Where oh where can I find that pie tin...so dreamy 🤩
Sorry but this seems so unappetizing 😖😖
Video sponsored by George R.R Martin
There is something about Mrs C and her recipes that is so addicting 😋
Now the question is: does that actually taste good?
No seasoning whatsoever 🤧🤧🤧😬🤢🤮
Ummm yeah no thanks give me butter chicken pie anytime compared to this monstrosity lol
Just save yourself the trouble and just scroll down for all the FEET comments lolll
🤢
What is wrong with these people. I think this must be the worst recipe I've ever seen
Why in the hell does she make me so happy?
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Put a bird on it.
wow so neat to learn how they cooked!
A practically sick and disgusting pigeon pie
If you were looking for a recipe for health and wellness you've found it. It's shocking how awful British food is, tis no wonder they spread diseases in the world
It looked like a Panettone no? And the feet...I mean...*why???*
Lawd no
Ewwww
The quail eggs go in whole?! That sounds really icky. >.<
Soulja boy voice: 

FEEEET?!
Why did this remind me of Monica Geller's story when she was trying to distance Phoebe and Mike from each other? 

"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!"
Only got the pastry! It's too fancy for me
I just love this series so much.
Based on this video I fail to understand how the English once controlled 2/3 of the globe.
Sometimes living in the city we forget that people still eat pigeons and they are edible.
Giiiirl, when she added those pigeon feet, I started gagging!
Nice. Love your rack!
A cooking show made with mind soothing style. Alas, no salt, or did I just miss it?
7:20 I can’t with her lol everything looked delish until she put those lil pigeon feet on top lol
I just wanted to tell, my grandma does hardly speak English, but she still adores these videos.
drink some wine in case the pie is dry...make sure nothing else is added on the wine or else you’ll choke
Not to be rude or anything, but the meat still looks kind of raw when you cut the pie open
what in the unseasoned culture is this
Kwern
Uhm where is the salt????
I’m gonna pass. I don’t think I’d be eating much in the Victorian era.
So disgusting :(
Ooh, gross!
Horrible
Me: eyeing the pigeons outside my windows
Pigeons: senses danger and flew away
I hope ur channel get pick for youtube rewind. Love watching it. Keep it up 😍
I am learning about the Victorian times in school and this was in my recommended😂
So happy to see you all back and on my birthday!
lol @ the ppl flipping out about the feet, y'all don't want to hear about chicken feet or duck tongue.
I just love this lady! So awesome 😙
Please note who actually ate this dish - I mean, this one looks more like a dish for the 'well-to-do' but which dishes were eaten by the poor et c. I understand that it might not quite mesh with the spoken narrative - perhaps put it in the description box then?
Love Mrs Crocombe! Such a marvelous reenactor. But honestly, the feet...
Pigeon feet 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
I let the meats and the little amount of seasoning used slide but the feet bruh nah
I didn't know pigeon meat was a thing!
So it’s a practically perfect pigeon pie in every way
OMG the breasts are not even washed or marinated not even rubbed with seasoning and people are obsessing over the feet...I understand she put herbs in layers but yuck the blood was still dripping from it
So lovely!
I CANT STOP LAUGHING AT THE FEET
If someone attempted to serve this to me I would take it as an insult and a duel would commence at once.
Poor pigeons :((
The force meat looks kinda like a meatloaf, without the eggs. Did Victorians ever use eggs as a binder in those types of recipes?
The idea of pigeon's legs didn't seem very appealing but a couple of days ago my dog found a bird's leg on the ground. It was probably from a pigeon. She gobbled it up and looked very pleased with her little snack so perhaps they are more tasty than  I would have guessed.
How gross and unappetising does this look. eww.
"I shall just add some feet."

Weird flex, but OK.
I'm a Chinese but still got shocked at 7:22.  I was like @A@!
We don't put feet in any pies, buns, cakes or whatever flour stuffs.  Definitely not for decoration of course!  LOL
Oof!  You'd need a dedicated pack horse to carry that lunch!  Hearty is an understatement!
No more than a few teaspoons of spiced flavours, but feet are okay...?
Loooove these videos!! 😍
Am I wrong for finding her sexy?
SAVE THE PIGEONS
THAT LAST BIT WITH THE FEET MADE ME WANT TO CRY D:
marry me
Victorian omnivores!
Those feet transformed this from an elegant pie to a halloween pie
feet? o.O
That cooked ham looks so industrial and melted gelatin? Did that exist back in the day? And those truffles looks... Weird
Poor force-fed calves
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
Did I miss the salt, or was it in the breadcrumbs?  It must be bland.
It looks awfully bland and raw omg
Eeeew!! Horrible!!!
disgusting
I know this is called "the victorian way" but watching this was really disgusting😨😨😨 I can't believe they ate pidgeons !!!😩😩😩 and the feet! Oh god 😲
If you recreate this recipe at home please do leave a comment to let us know how it turns out. It would also be interesting to hear if you make any modifications or substitutions.

Below is a list of answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about this episode that we hope you find useful:

1. Velouté sauce is made with a butter and flour roux to which hot stock is added. It's like a white or bechamel sauce but with stock.

2. You can use any white fish to recreate this recipe, including fillets of fish.

3. This meal stays hot whilst the soup is being eaten because the plate has been warmed up and it's a big fish.

4. Mrs Crocombe does not strain the sauce, she pushes it through the sieve to purée it. All the lobster is still there, but the sauce is consistent and velvety with no lumps.

5. French was often used for recipes as it was considered more upmarket and fashionable. Even if a dish was very English, it was given a French name and the vast majority of upper class menus were written in French.

6. Flounders and turbot are both flatfish (as are plaice, dab, sole and many others) but that is where the resemblance ends. Turbot were (and indeed are) regarded as one of the most delicious fish around, hence their price and prestige. Nowadays they are often farmed, which means they are slightly less expensive compared to those caught in the wild. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) also rates them as relatively sustainable: 
It's good to finally see someone publicly throwing shade on people who cook puddings in their turbot kettle, it is about time those peasants got their comeuppance.
Why am I so addicted to watching these
“Now add a giant handful of salt right on the fish’s face.” 😂 Just teasing, Mrs. Crocombe.
"Which one of my kitchen maids can do" she says with that smug look 😂
Warning, this clip contains instances of shade right from the start.
"Its always pleasing to use something for its specific purpose." Deep
Do NOT serve Mrs. Crocombe one of your turbot-cooked puddings! She'll clock that a mile away.
5:07 you must tuck in your turbot to ensure that it has sweet dreams, this gives it more flavour
NATURALLY IM GOING TO COOK THIS IN MY TURBOT KETTLE.
2:27 Judge us if you must Miss Crocombe, but we had 14 guests instead of the expected 10. 
And we're out of Gateau de Pomme.
"Now add....salt"
*PUTS A HANDFUL OF SALT ON THE FACE OF THE FISH"

ME: 😱😱😱😱
I have absolutely no reason to want a turbot kettle. But I still want one.
SHE PUT A BLANKET OVER IT, AHH
Sees Mrs. Crocombe in a new video and STOPS EVERYTHING!
I'm under the impression that 'a la ingles' is code for 'boil it'
Mrs Crocombe does not approve of steaming puddings in one's turbot kettle!
Mrs. Crocombe looks so disapproving of using a turbot kettle for anything other than turbot lol
We’ve certainly missed Ms. Crocombe
All those expeditions  to get spices from the east and not a one went on that damn boiled  fish smh
You know it’s expensive when LOBSTER is used as a SIDE
The turbot is even tucked in with a blanket to keep it warm, after it got a nice, hot bath. You do know how to take care of your guests, Mrs Crocrombe ( ;
Mrs Crocombe, you're a blessing! I love this series and the actress that plays Mrs crocombe is brilliant xx
She just tucks in the turbot that's so cute
Alexa... order a Turbot & Lobster with roe. Thanks
That lobster sauce is decadent af. My, "how times have changed"
The beginning is basically the "ghaaa! I could've dropped my croissant!" But like... fancy
Our queen of the kitchen has returned!
English style: put it in hot water with no seasoning or taste and serve
Me: A broke and struggling college student who has never heard of Turbot and probably will never cook it or even see it in real life.
Also me: MRS. CROCOMBE HAS COOKED TURBOT SO I MUST DROP EVERYTHING TO WATCH SUCH QUALITY CONTENT!!
Fish looked cosy af in the blanket
Yaaaaaas queen is back 🙌🏼
oh my god i get so happy when i hear that music 😭
Love the video as always, love how she disapprove of things.
One slight problem with Sauce Americaine [Lobster Sauce]:  It is illegal to catch and retain a female lobster bearing roe in U.S. waters.   In fact, in order to preserve a depleted fishery and species, females carrying roe are permanently marked before being returned to the ocean.  Anyone caught with a marked lobster in their possession is subject to criminal prosecution.  Catching and consuming egg bearing females almost eliminated the species by the 1980s, and this very accurate slice of history shows why.
You know your channel is good when a vegan clicks desperately to see a video on cooking fish, hehe!
I like how they do that close up of all those spices but none of the recipes use them lol
Mrs Crocombe threw major shade on people who use their turbot pot for unsavory pudding making activities.
GREETINGS FROM MEXICO 🇲🇽 AND GREAT VIDEO AS ALWAYS!
I bet the queen has turbot Tuesday’s
I just Googled turbot kettle and I am currently fanning myself as a result of having seen the price of one!
14 salty turbots disliked this video but I loveeeeeee it.
The fact that she can tell the difference between water and stale water (like me) makes me love her so much more 😂
My queen I've been waiting for another video! I have my wig ready just so I can snatch it off when you gag me with your Original recipes and read those Kitchen maids like a New York times best seller. VICTORIAN VIXEN, serving up looks and fierce food!!!!!
which one of my kitchen maids will do.....the shade lol
Looking at this from the perspective of a 21st century American, these videos are a really good way to experience Victorian England. Which is perfect. Because as much as I love England, the Victorian period is a great time and place to visit,I wouldn't want to live there.
Am I the only one who at 1:44 clearly heard the voice of someone crying out "WHERE ARE MY SEWING SCISSORS?"  The Lady's seamstress must be livid right about then.
Turbot pots are nearly $2,000!! Would still love to have one..
Ask what sauce your employer likes :-)
WE MUST PROTECT HER AT ALL COST.
She spoke of people using the turbot kettle for steaming puddings with such disapproval.
I'm beginning to fall in love with Mrs Crocombe
Under no conditions shall we use cistern or pipe water.
Victorian bae is back! ❤
It's boiled fish with some uncooked sauce.
I'm not even native english speaker yet I found this video series highly attractive. Also I really have to say actress is very nice almost feels like watching scene from movie about 19'th century britain made by top movie maker
I love the British, I really do, the history is rich and they're amazing people... But... By God their cooking is awful.
I usually stay away from comments, but I love reading those of a crowd addicted to Mrs Crocombe videos!
God forbid you use tap water..might make your dinner stale..way too expensive to ruin 😂😂😂
Greetings from the USA. I love these videos. Please keep them coming., Would love to see Mr and Mrs Braybrooke sometime in a video.
5:08 But what are you supposed to do with it after you tuck it in?
A batterie de cuisine is not complete without a turbot kettle. No self-respecting cook would cook turbot in anything else.
Oh, to have a kitchen maid.  But alas .... LOVE Mrs. Crocombe.   I look forward to each and every one!
"English heritage" boils fish puts a napkin on it and calls this cuisine lol
.     yay, it's Mrs. Crocombe     👍👍👍
Turbot is for royal and aristocrat? 
Well in my country local Turbot species considered as poor man fish. Wow
Never clicked so fast on my life. I love her!
Looks like you’re putting it to bed with that napkin 😂
What a beautiful filming technique! Every picture is just a pleasure for the eyes! The videographer, who is filming it, and the videoeditor, who edits the shots, must be geniuses! I take my hat off to you, ladies or gentlemen!
'oh, a simple old recipe for turbot, great. let's see... salt, lemon, a  L O B S T E R  '
Very enjoyable video as always! Thank you! 💗
Why would they want lobster? Wasn’t that considered exceedingly low class back then? The cockroach of the sea!
Turbots are such weird looking creatures
I was missing you mrs Crocombe..thank u fr coming back 😍😍😍
that was a lot of salt
I have no desire to make Tubot, but Mrs. Cromcombe is always so lovely that I watched this video 3 times instead of studying. Jeepers.
".... which one of my kitchen maids can do." OK I see you Crocombe
That looks like something that was dipped out of sewer. Probably smells that way too.
For this recipe you will need. A turbot.  
When your in a fully raw video: making fully raw mashed potatoes: for this recipe you will need cauliflower. 😂🤣😅🤪
Her:  now add salt
*puts whole freaking ocean in the steamer*
Was Mrs. Crocombe throwing shade because someone uses the turbot kettle for cooking puddings instead of it's specific purpose, or is it just me? 🤔
sees Mrs Crocombe video * *CLICKS IMMEDIATELY

the sauce sounds delicious, but the fish itself seems to be plain... does it have a very strong taste?
"This fish is far more expensive to be ruined"
Grandma: You go fetch some Turbot from the backyard pond. . Haha. . Turbot is pretty common here in asia. . Didnt know it would be of great value in western cuisine. .
Modern English accent: You dare pronounce your Rs?!
The accent of Ms. Crocombe: You dare not pronounce your Rs?

Just me who's enraptured by the accent?
Mrs. Crocombe's kitchen reminds me of my late great-grandmother's kitchen. Everything looks so wonderful....
When is YouTube gonna give Mrs Crocombe a couple shillings for a new dress. A queen deserves it
Fancy way of calling melted butter "please hand me the Velouté sauce" 😂
English-style turbot: give the turbot a trim (we mustn’t be unkempt at Lord and Lady Braebrook’s table), a nice hot bath in salty water, lay it on a warm bed and cover it with a linen sheet. 

Are they eating the fish, or having a nap with it? 🤣
2:57 "This fish is far too expensive to be ruined. Now add.... salt." 

I think Lord and Lady Braebrook would have enjoyed some Turbot with their salt... surely?
5 star restaurants be like

Fish a la Anglaise: Selectively bred fish perfectly cooked in seasoned water with aromatic parsley

Equals: boiled fish and throw in some parsley.
“I have heard some have used theirs to steam puddings”
Face screaming: uncultured swines
@4:24 “Which one of my kitchen maids can do”

 Know your rank!😂
This was as interesting as usual, but when Mrs Crocombe put that napkin over the fish I laughed really hard. 
Goodnight, sweet prince
Avis you're back 🤗🤗🤗 
Happy New year to all at English Heritage.
Theme music starts and immediately smashes the like button 🙌
This recipe is a good idea for my whole family, but I'm not sure if there's other than using turbot
Because Mrs Crocombe said this turbot is far too expensive
"This now needs to be put through a sieve"

struggles to scoop using a wooden spoon

"...which one of my kitchen maids can do""
I was so happy to see Mrs. Crocumb when I opened YouTube just now!! ❤️❤️ one question though...Did you just add butter to the butter?😂
The shade Ms. Crocombe throws is amazing. I love her
You can use a turbot kettle to cook multiple dead man’s leg at the same ti - NOT IN MY KITCHEN YOU PEASANT!
God bless the Great British Empire! 😄
Mrs Crocombe, for that amount of salt you must be related to Gordon Ramsay!
Please say almonds, please say almonds.... 



She doesn't say almonds. :(
Needs more parsley. Goodnight, Mr. Turbot ♡
"Turbot under napkin blanket!:D"
Firstly, I love your channel and work...
Now, please can you tell me where to find the music you used. I love it and I would love to read and study to it! 😍😍😍💖💖💕
Would someone explain to me what, "pounded roe" is?
0:45 so English people cook this fish and call it "fish in the English style" in French instead of just calling it "fish" or "turbot"

They use lobster for sauce....
That would rather be my main dish for dinner. This dish is so fancy. 😭
Seriously, Gordon Ramsay who?! I love her!! 😍😍
I really love the music from the beginning, can you offer me the link ??? ( lots of love )
As soon as I saw the red bell I stopped watching the other vid to come here. E H and Mrs Crocombe never let me down.
omg i really love her accent omfg XOxo
So just 1 fish will suffice for her masters, their guests and other staff at the mansion?🤔
I don't know if I would be able to eat that!  Bleh
Mrs Crocombe : " This fish is far too expensive too be ruined " 
 Also Mrs Crocombe : proceeds to dump a mountain of salt on the fish
Turbot a l'anglaise... i.e. boiled with salt... Thank God we've got a sense of humour because our food is shite. No offence, Mrs. C.
I absolutely adore the intro music!....when I hear it, I feel like a little girl about ready to go on a journey.....💜
“I have read, the Queen eats it regularly.”

Me: “LIES.”
Wut is a Turbot?
Oh wait, it answered meh question in the video. I'm dumb :p but this is very interesting 
(Heard lobster)
Just gimme that lobster! It's so yummy! Cook me the lobster please!!
I Would need to fully improvise the sauce, since I'm allergic to shellfish (Crab, lobster, shrimp...)
Ah yes, I seem to have misplaced my turbot kettle.
Maravilhoso!!!! já estava esperando vídeo novo.
Now let me just get my turbot kettle ... which, alas, I don't possess.

Btw, I really don't know how anyone could give these lovely videos a thumbs down?
I can't get over how she says cayenne and sauce. I love it so much <3
She's back! Just saw her new video then whoops. #satisfied but ready for the next.

I hope to see Mary-Anne being scolded by her. LOL.
What is the purpose of the lemon rub I wonder ....mmmmmm?
My ancestors used to make pans and clocks and such, now I finally know what that big copper kettle that I inherited is for! :)
I love these vids!! So calming
How to cook Turbot, you will need;
A whole god damned lobster.
My english is very poor, But I love you channel, thanks for sharing , greetings from México
''this fish is far too exspensive to be ruined!''
slams gigantic amount of salt on fish's face
Yeah Mrs C, let me just whip out my turbot kettle I have for this special occasion
I have used Tepid tap water thank you and it hasnt effected the cooking quality of my turbot thank you very much!  Spring water my bloody eye!
Sadly instructions a bit unclear.
 I just ruined my pension schemes with a pot of strained sauce...
The Turbot has a face like it's left pondering its own existence after an unfortunate run-in with the in-laws.
Queen Crocombe has returned to bless us with another historically accurate delicacy
Now add (Drops box of salt in pan) Salt
Holy-Butt that sure looks weird.  Thanks.  Also ref "Poor mans Lobster."  
Regards
So basically, just boil it in water with a massive amount of salt. 👀😏🤷🏼‍♀️
"Vlootie Source" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
then: kitchen maid
now: kitchen aid
Gordon ramsay sees this
"REALLY? YOU TURN THE LOBSTER TO A SAUCE?"
😂
It would be amusing to have seen the production staff enjoying the Turbot after filming was over.
Oh!! hello... don't be afraid... it's just a recording device from the twenty first century...
What a lovely recipe. I am so lucky to have found this channel. I am not English but I am very fond of the English heritage. 
I wonder if the sauce is poured onto the fish when served, or everybody adds it into their own plate?
What is wrong with me I go from the friendly death mortician to paternity court then Dr PP and Dr Gilmore and toe bro to now this ?? I need to sort my life out.
So this may seem like a weird question but who did the shopping? Did the head cook go out by themselves or with the lord and lady was it delivered. It just a question that I have swirling since I started bing watching these
gosh, but that sauce sounds rich. I can feel my heart seizing up just watching it
this fish is to expensive to ruin
(Pours on massive handful of salt only on the fish's head) 🤣
"Oh, hello, you gave me such a fright what with your being from the 21st century and, what did you call it - filming me?"
2:31 I was waiting for the CAN'T RELATE
0:27 Is it me or is does turbot look a grumpy looking fish 🐠🤣😂🤣😂🤣
It looked amazing thou 😋😋😁😁😁
The more I watch the more I love this woman with her meaningful digs at the camera 😂🤣😂❤️❤️❤️
"ah... ok .... wait.... WHAT??? ahww... fine...!  what why!? ewww..."
by my Cantonese friend
I love this and I'm proud to have part English heritage
And also we'll just go ahead and cover that in lobster...
too few and far between. I loved seeing you in PriorAttire
Could you make something with Yorkshire Pudding?
oohhhh mrs.crocombe
im not liking this one...
just a plain boiled fish with some weird sauce....
Omg! That was like 1kg of  salt!😨😨😨😨
Mrs Crocombe is bae and her cult grows ever so stronger with each new video!!!
Oh we made flounder with a lemon sauce and potatoes in class today!  I loved it! This however sounds even better
When you said REMEMBER that was not in British accent
Metric measurements?

Not very traditional English at all

Quite disappointing
Honestly one of my favorite food network shows
Fan mail from some flounder
I was waiting for the candied peel to make an appearance, alas no 🤣
“This now needs to be put through a sieve.”
one scoop
“Which one of my kitchen maids can do.”
I wonder how its flavor matches up with Petrale sole? Which is like the US West Coast version of this...a region-specific flatfish that is all the rage in fancy restaurants.
I'd be game to try this!
Oh, I hate fish and would never prepare it. Yet I love watch those short recipes and Mrs Crocombe.
How come one character can make my day so much better? 
All the best for everyone at English Heritage. :)
So essentially we run the fish with lemon, dump a handful of salt and steam it. 
Then serve with sauce. Sounds like another good reason America broke with the Brits, 😂
Never heard of or seen a Turbot before in my life!!
Lady Braybrooke is beautifull your pudin mrs. Crocombe
I wish they'd show a scene of lady braybrooke taking a bite, or the camera showing the arms of someone eating it. I love these recipes, but I'm left wondering how its to be served!
I will gladly eat anything ms Crocombe prepares
she gave the fishie a blankey òwó u will have good luck after watching this video, but only if u comment "sleep well, fishie"
YES, THANK YOU!  These videos make me so happy
Mrs. Crocombe is just as spicy as her sauce today! 😂😂💙😂 🐟
I am from the Louisiana Gulf Coast area. Are turbot cousins to our Flounder?
The sauce sounds pretty good - but we are really talking about a boiled salted whole fish here.
It's pronounced Turbeaux, in houses aspiring to the gentry.....
How do you buy all this food in for the channel and afford it, and what happens to the finished products once the show’s over? Is there still a Braybrooke family living there or does the food get shared around?
That turbot looks positively delectable, Mrs. Crocombe! I love how you deign to explain the other silly ways one might use a turbot kettle, even though it's obviously improper to cook a pudding in a fish pan. Lol.
Isn’t the term “fish monger” a Shakespearean insult?
I just lived for this series. ♡
I dropped everything to watch this 😂😂😂
love this lady <33
This is where the ReAL ASMR StarTEd
why does this recipe looks more expensive than my phone?

the lobster sauce alone is almost as expensive as my shoes. and its a nike.
OMG, My English has improved a lot since I listen to your channel!!! Thank you so much!!!!
Welcome back.  I love these vids.
Me sitting with my bowl of instant chicken ramen : Of course you can't use piped water, ghastly!
She cooks so gently lol
Im shook bc there was literally no seasoning
“Now add salt”
*puts a handful in 😬
0:39 oh my—well I hope the lord and lady at least seasoned their guests properly beforehand 😂
I love how she essentially tucked the fish in
Regardless of what it is, Im gonna like before watching!
Oh man, I just found this channel on my recommendations today and I am hooked! I'll see about trying some of the recipes, though I might need to substitute a  few things since my part of Asia don't have some of the ingredients in local markets. This dish though, wonder if I can use other fish?
I feel like i'm in a listening test lol
I enjoy this series so much, please keep 'em coming. Merci!
I'm curious as to how it's supposed to be served?
I love this so much! Can't believe how authentic Cathy is playing her!
I could watch your videos all day every day, they are great!!
That sounds utterly amazing. But I just can't get past the fact that NO ONE SKINNED IT.
YAASSS we love a Turbot cooking QUEEN!!
She should go up against Gordon Ramsay
Turbot in a blanket :)

Great work once more guys !
This videos are quite relaxing....thanks👏👏👏👏👏😚😚
New recipe name: fish boiled in sea water with a whisper of lemon
it made me hungry! Fantastic recipe Mrs. Crocombe, thanks!
I love you Mrs Crocombe and I love English Herritage
Am I the only one who saw the dash of cayenne and immediately thought of Chef John and Food Wishes? 😂 You are after all the Marquise of your Turbot Anglais!
bruh she put blanket on the fish 😂
Ask me why this is my favorite Crocombe video. 
I have no bloody idea why, but it is.
So that's how you pronounce "turbot!" I always wondered!
Hiya Mrs. Crocombe! Happy New Year ❤
I want a scullery maid!  Cooking would be so much easier.  Can you get them on Amazon or eBay?
I usually come here for the video, but I must say that the comments are never disappointing either!
10k in 2 hours. Amazing.
Thank you so much for another Mrs. Crocombe video! The actress is wonderful! She has such presence!
She is so impressive. Id be cracking up constantly. Also i just want to eat everything she makes
I'm not sure why, but a whole lobster as one of the ingredients really made me gigfle
Am i the only one empathizing for the turbot, how cozy and intricate it was cooked, and the blanket. The turbot must feel happy being served liked that.
Omg yaaaay😍 finally another one❤️
Posted on my birthday?! Thank you so much Mrs. Crocombe 😍😍😍 much love from the Philippines
....but she just boiled a fish! I love these videos so much
Well, watching these recipes at least settles one issue for me. I should be vegetarian! flees from food that still looks like the living thing
Wow what a grate video. Recepie is amazing. Love this speak between people.
Mrs. Crocombe back at it again snatching wigs, waist and waistlines!!!!❤
I can't believe I missed this when it was posted! I love these videos and Mrs Crocombe is a gem <3
Still looking for that “r” in “cayenne” and sauce.” All in good fun! I love these videos!
Essentially boiled with salt and slapped on a plate is "the english style".. you dont say.
I am shocked! The fins of the turbot should never be removed! This vital information was relayed by the great mrs. Beeton herself, for the lords name!
Lord and Lady Braybrooke have the best food made for them! They have such a talented cook <3 Mrs.Crocombe does not disappoint!
I love all your videos. Could you subtitle in Spanish? Hugs from argentina!
"this fish is far too expensive to ruin"


Proceeds to ruin with a giant clump of salt all in one spot.
Im not even a big cook but these are so entertaining and well made
I’ve never heard of a Turbot 🤔
Amazing video as usual, but I guess the salt was too much 😂😂
I've never clicked a video so fast! I love Mrs. Crocombe 😁
please please please give her, her own netflix tv show 10000000000000000000/10 would watch
The fish looked like it was in bed with the napkin on it
That lobster sauce is so wasteful. Omg.
Ohhh happiness a new Mrs. Crocombe video❤️❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💕😍
the amount of quotable lines here is amazing
That sauce sounds divine.  I wonder how it would be with a velouté made with lobster broth?
Ms Crocombe is so shady I love it.
The sauce sounds amazing!
$1950.00 at William Sonoma.
I do so love Victorian Shade. LOL
Oh my Mrs crocombe you put the turbot to bed lol
SHES BACK! ❤️
Take a shot everytime she says turbot.
Thank you for a new video! This needs to be a weekly blessing to the world.
I literally screamed when I get the notification bell!
2:27 the way she threw shade without saying anything rude at the same time 😂😂😂😂❤️👍
Honest question. Is this legit? Can't be right?
Well, I declare. It's rather "shady" in Lord and Lady Braybrooke's kitchen. lol
My veloute! Sortedfood would be impressed
Hello im from indonesia.
And i am really like this channel
Esp mrs crocombe edition.
Are turbots still expensive nowadays?

P.s. I live in Asia so I'm not quite familiar with the fish.
Wow. I didn't know flatfish like turbot is expensive in England. I guess we Southeast Asians are lucky because we have several similar flatfish species and they are relatively common and inexpensive here in Southeast Asia.

I have to say, flatfishes are amongst the best. They are really delicious, and we love to fry and then cook them in sweet, sour and spicy sauce.

Anyway, love this video and Mrs Crocombe, as always. Although I wished this video has shown us how to serve that turbot with that lobster sauce, a l'Anglaise, at the end.
These videos are always a highlight of my day when they appear! Keep up the fantastic work, everyone! Perhaps I'll be able to visit one day! Until then, thank you guys so very much. C:

Edit: I'd love to know! Since you say that no food is wasted, how did the turbot taste? Was it as grand and regal as suggested?
Thank you for posting these videos!
Naturally, I'll use my Turbot kettle.
Luv this channel but my G-d that music is distracting!😠
I'm sure there's many a man that has fallen prey to the irresistible wiles of Mrs Crocombe's experienced 'turbot kettle'...  ;o)
Nothing better than Crocombe saying "Oohhh, hello!! You gave me such a fright!!" 😱🐟
In Baltic region, turbot isn't a luxury, lobsters are.
Ms. Crocombeeee can we do that to Gurame or Bandeng? 😆
we need Mrs. Crocombe for the next Youtube Rewind
probably the worst way of cooking fish
English Heritage: always proud to stand on others to do their dirty work for them.
Turbot makes me laugh every time you say it
Uhh...please do something about the eye...it's looking at me.
Wonderful to see you again Mrs Crocombe!  Happy New Year 🥳
This is honestly one of my favorite YouTube series. I get so much joy out of every new video!
I love this channel 💕😊
Is turbot just flat fish/flounder or is it different?
I marrinated my fish with a bit of coriander powder and sweet basil paste,and cooked the fish with water mixed with five spice powder and just smeared the fish with diced ginger mixed with honey...try it you will love it..god bless you...
First my favourite band do a livestream now Mrs Crocombe my lucky day
Yes!!!! 😍 a new ms. Crocombe video!
I love a good ol' turbot kettle
As a lover of seafood, I'm going to try this as soon as I am able. :P <3 <3 <3
Lady Crocombe, your lobster sauce looks divine.
My scullery maid never washes the turbot properly.
i go thru phases on yt where i binge watch rlly diff categories of stuff from makeup to well...this.
Steamed/boiled fish?!
when she said “this now needs to be put through a sieve . which one of my kitchen maids can do” SIS I-
Can't say I've heard of turbot before. What a handsome fellow he is!
The amount of hilarious comments is crazy out there ! You all have me laughing with the throwing of shade and all the jokes about the turbot kettle :D
Seriously i ve never in my life heard of this fish 😮😂❤❤
Mrs. Crocombe, you are back! I am so delighted to see you again!
When she says "sauce" I keep hearing "source"
I always get so excited when i see videos like these i love these/ your videos💜💜💜
So, Turbot the English way is boiling the fish in water with a ton of salt? XD
Guess I need to get me a Turbot kettle....
I thought the American aversion to serving fish (or anything) with head/face still attached was a vestigial English tradition. Guess not!!
I feel like I'm the only one horrified by the way she seasons things. I mean, Lady! Don't just salt the face!! Lol
TINABAL RAMAN NA SA AMOA OY.  😂
What did I watch before this channel? I always find this interesting even if I wouldn't want to eat the food. Thanks
ah yes i too have a scullery maid of my own
5:05 awww, you tucked in the Turbot
How I’ve missed you Mrs. Crocombe!!
Dead at Kay-urn pepper
Was seafood particularly popular in common classes in Victorian times or only nobles ate them?
That looked & sounded delicious!!! Wish I were invited to that meal...
This is too much elegant for my eyes
Madam, may I ask if you know a particular victorian maid named Maria?  Hehehe
Fancy french name ... just boiled in salt water, lol.
ooo that lobster sauce would be delicious spread on freshly baked bread!
Amazing online video! Sitting here at Y&S FOOD! we all love to find these types of content. We create Travel & Food video too, world wide, and therefore we are constantly seeking inspirations as well as concepts. Thank You.
The food in this channel is gross but I like watching it's videos
Good God today this beast would come garnished with shaved truffles and gold leaf.....
"One of my kitchen maids can do" what a kween what an icon lol
Mrs Crocombe is the best. Lots of love from India. 🇮🇳
I would use that pan to steam puddings, I don't like fish :/
“For this recipe you will need a terbot” you don’t say?
Ah yes, À L'anglaise, one of the oldest cooking memes by the french. "Boil the devil out of it."
That's fantastic! Here in China we steam the turbot with soy sauce and sliced scallion. I should also try the Victorian style.
Turbot is so damn cheap in Asia HAHAHA we can get it at the night market or day market for a low price!
Oh god, I live for these comments!
“Remember, it’s very important to blind the fish with a fist of salt, just in case it comes back to life and tries to escape.”
Was anyone else overly excited to see a new video had been posted...?! Happy new year Mrs Crocombe! From everyone here at the rescue x
Awwww putting the fish to bed 😂
This was on that programme on queen victoria's wedding
Mrs. Crocombe... casting shade on those ill-mannered plebes who insist on steaming puddings in a turbot kettle....
In the Victorian time, how much would that Turbot of actually cost?
I get so excited Everytime these pop up!!! I love her!!!
Wow that was a really diced lobster
just salt? id have to taste that to be convinced lol. i wanted to throw cloves of garlic in everything so badly! lol
Steaming puddings in the turbot kettle? Heaven and earth! Are the shades of Audley End House to be thus polluted?
I was happy to find that farmed turbot is currently rated as mostly sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society.
We stan a Turbot Queen
Do. You make your own butter for recipes? What do you buy in stores vs create or make or farm?
who else hits the thumbs up before the video actually starts? :D
I have heard of Turbot but haven't ever eaten it myself. Looks very nice for dinner. Thank you very much for the video.
In New England we call a turbot a flounder.
Is anyone actually making this at home
Is it me or does her accent get thicker every video?
I don't have a maid to sift my freaking sauce...damn it!
4:24 XD;;;; ilu Mrs. Crocombe XD;;;;
I simply adore how she pronounces words like "sauce", that r intrusion sounds lovely!
Dear me, Mrs Crocombe, you pronounced "sauce" the American way, with a clear "R".
Lord what🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
3:07 JESUS CHRISTOPHER THATS A LOT OF SALT
Holy fish.
Nice touch with the garlic, makes it look way more appetizing!
Never had that type of fish before, but it’s really the sauce, that caught my attention. It sounds delicious!
Yay, a new video! I absolutely love this series, I love all things from the Victorian era
You should try Turbrit a la mexicana
Damn that was a lot of salt
Take that all you people cooking puddings in your turbot kettles. You tell'em Mrs. Crocombe.
Yay, Mrs Crocombe is back! But I have to say I don't get this dish - I would have eaten the lobster :D
That face when Mrs C. talks about the cistern water.
The ground lobster sauce is the only part that really made me not want to try this 😂
The shade Mrs Crocombe dishes up (no pun intended) is delightful
That fish looks so hideous😷
Thanks for posting? Do people eat this strange looking fish today?
I think I've fallen down a rabbit hole
5:07 aww the fish got a little blanket
So basically boiled fish... pan fried would have been tastier.
Waiting for Mrs. Crocombe

Mrs. Crocombe: Oh hello! You gave me such a fright!

 Sorry, Mrs Crocombe.

 It would have been a disaster if I dropped this turbot.

 What's a turbot?

 Turbot is one of the  to serve and is very popular with families like Lord & Lady Braybrooke.

 Must be a very expensive kind of fish then.

 I have read the Queen eats it quite regularly.

 Really? So, what's our  occassion to serve this kind of fish?

 Lord & Lady Braybrooke have guests for dinner and they've asked me to serve turbot and so I've chosen one of the most traditional recipes - a 

 Sorry, a what?

 ... or 'turbot in the English style'.

 Ohh. So what will we need?

 For this recipe...
OK, what's that velouté sauce I've never heard of ?
The shad is strong with this one
Love this stuff
Serving it this way is fine from a cooks point of view as the senior staff upstairs would then portion the fish presumably.  What would have been nice is to see in this instance is how this would have been done.  Especially as turbot is a very expensive fish.  Family guests would not be expected to do this themselves, especially as they would be offered the fish to help themselves from the platter.  So, it would have to be managable for someone seated.
Turbot? Nah that’s an olive flounder
That turbot seems snug.
Yasss thy queen is back to slay thee
Because we all have turbot steamers lol
As a English woman that knows all about history I love this x
I don't know which recipe is more horrifying - THIS ONE or the Turkey Gallantine. "...and then cut off the fins." Augh!
I'm here and I love it!
4:23 SAVAGE
This looks so gross!!!!!!! Kudos to you though for sticking with tradition.
a turbot kettle- okay
now that's a cooked piece of fish
Love how a Lobster is one of the side ingredients 😂
Have been missing Mrs. Crocombe and the actor who plays her.  So glad they are back.
I was just wondering. I don't know about other countries, but in America, beyond using the imperial system in cooking, we measure a lot of ingredients (such as flour and butter) by volume rather than weight. So just out of curiosity, would you be able to post the rough volume equivalents of these ingredients alongside their weight for us Americans that might want to replicate these recipes?
Why did she put the salt all in one spot???
Why did she put all that salt in one spot 😭😭😭😭😭😭
It's pretty interesting to see how even these subtle kinds of trends have changed over time. Where before, it was the most pleasing to use a very specific tool for a very specific purpose, it is now more popular to see how many (normal to really weird) ways we can use any old thing. 


Cooking fish and other food in a dishwasher. Testing if one can cook a full course meal with just a coffee pot. The entire minimalist movement of "how can we make this simultaneously one piece of a furnture a bookshelf, a murphy bed, a closet, and a work desk".
that salt tho XD
just boiling fish and giving salt
I thought the fish kettle was a good idea so looked for one, and oh my god they are so expensive 😭 £800 and upwards 😭😭😭
Where can I find my local fishmonger in Ohio? Oh yeah and I in 2019 at that. I've never heard of turbot.
Boiled fish .....!
......eeyakkkkk thuuu!
Yay!! New Mrs. Crocombe video! Turbot is still an expensive fish, and this lobster sauce is decadent.
Don't worry, Mrs. Crocombe: I use my Mauviel turbot pan for its intended purpose. It's nice to visit with you, again, and what a lovely recipe. Cheers!
England has lost so much of it's luster. It's nice to see videos like this!
Geez. Want some fish with that salt? Lol
sweet dreams Turbot
I get so excited when I see a new episode uploaded! Pls make more!
When she dumped 327 tablespoons of salt.......😳
Man, i have absolutely no idea of this turbot sea creature. From the title, it made me interested.  Thanks.
Turbot is so ugly and creppy O.o
“Saurce”.
字幕ヒラメがカレイになって…
Very common fish in Hong Kong.
I love this series soo much hehehe
Okay but for real, what’s Mrs Crocombe’s Instagram
looks like flatz flounder
I didn’t know she pronounces the ‘t’ at the end. I always heard it so the ‘t’ was silent
BTS 
ARMY
Eeeeeeee click!
“This now needs to be put through a sift... which one of my kitchen maids can do”
is so nice to watch a video that you will like, even before the video begins...
5:06 goodnight
In the end Theres only sponge Pudding left 😂😂
I'd like to see Binging with Babish try to recreate some of these dishes.
Correction: How to cook flats the flounder.
Soooooo we could also puree the lobster sauce with a food processor and then strain it just to be sure? It would make the couli much easier
Yay!! New video 😍❤ although that fish looks gross, I still love the video, and the whole process of preparing the food is so interesting.
Awesome 
Right on Mrs C
Victorian Household eats Turbot?
Charge! Its MRS.C! We've so been waiting for you lady! That fish is beautiful! I have never seen one. I would like to have a live one in a tank...but anyhoo what do they taste like? What did they do with the lobster and roe they sieved out of the sauce? Loved this as always. Thankyou guys and ladies!😘🌶🐟🇬🇧 PS any word on the apple curd or jam?😋🍎🍏or the egg carrier?😍 Hope the holidays were good for all of you!
Mrs. CrumbCake! My favorite!
The show is like diving into a fairy tale story.... love it.
Amazing as usual! 😍🙌
So glad you’re back!
That was a lot of salt!😲
Watch out Mary Anne.  She knows you been ruining all the expensive fish dishes.
the fish looks slimy and green...feel like throwing up
Oh God...the shade in this video!! Mrs. Crocombe is coming after the other cooks.
So much salt lol
where do i get a turbot in my country ?
queen of cooking, invented fish
So the lobster was for the sauce to fish!  Time have really changed.
I go into the most giddy excitement every time Mrs Crocumbe again deigns to grace YouTube with the light of her glorious presence!  I am sure Lady Braybrook must have felt that she should be doing the curtseying, such is Mrs Crocumbe's grandeur!
When are we ever going to see lord or lady braybrook
The sieve used to smooth out the sauce would have been a drum sieve or tammis, not a conical sieve known as a chinoise.
Maybe it's how it was prononced back them, but now, "turbot in english style" in french would be "turbot a l'anglaise", not "turbot a la anglaise". I was still quite impressed by the great french pronounciation.
Sauce
Sorce
MRS CROCOMBE I LOVE YOU ♥♥♥
Good to have you back, Mrs. Crocombe. The New Year's looking better already.
I had no idea they used so much cayenne pepper
I'm Happy to see this!
The only channel where I will not instantly turn off when being instructed to take out your turbot kettle.  :)
I wach this video not just to look delicious food but to learn english too haha
I hope more recipes of Mrs crocombe will come out soon 😍
It must be very expensive.. she uses lobster as a side and she even puts it through the sieve.
Oh mrs crocombe we love it when you throw that shade ))))))
Never heard of a Turbot.
Why am I so addicted?!?!
Ugh.. queen of cooking turbot.
I was expecting a close up shot of her sieving the sauce but when she said the kitchen maids could do that I laughed out loud
That is one push-up bra!
While this is very good and somehow heartwarming video, I kinda think I would've come up with 'cooking the fish in saltwater' by myself xD
How is lobster suitable for Lord and Lady Braybrooke? Are they no longer considered a trash food for the lower classes?
Mrs Crocombe loves getting her hands on a bottom feeder.
I always wish you’d show it being served.  I would love to see how things were  plated and eaten.
Oh how I love these videos! Thanks for introducing us to Mrs. Crocombe and a neat perspective of English history. I have always been more interested in the daily lives of history's "regular people" than the upper classes and the ruling class. And to the actress who plays Mrs. Crocombe, your work is fantastic; you really bring the character to life!
I’ve only ever had turbot in restaurants. I’ve never seen turbot in a fish mongers.
5:07 he’s sleeping
Started watching these by accident, while researching medieval cooking history for a book. Not what I was looking for originally, but definitely a great find! I loove watching this channel because of the great actress, interesting recipes and wonderful interactive history. I watch these to wind down, and my ten yr old brother loves them as well!!
this fish is far to expensive for you
So boil a fish
I take it that this after the period the upperclass realized how delicious lobster is?
HELL YES
Ooh, I wish we could have seen this served table side. How on earth does on carve a turbot? As always happy to be in Mrs. C's kitchen!
What's the old timey word for "DMs"? I need slide into Ms. Crocombe's.
Hi ! I feel bad, but I have to correct you dear Mrs Crocombe (and EH team) ! It's not "à LA anglaise" but "à L' anglaise". However, great video, as always ! ♥
Is it just me or;
Not to ruin the turbot, you should not dump a load salt on its head and just close the pot. 
You should have made sure that the water was boiling before you put your fish in. And not least have ALL your preparation and sauces made before you cook that delicious and delicate fish. 
But yes, English Heritage is doing very well with series. But please sharpen up your character’s cooking skills. 
Nothing personal EH
literally no spices but a giant handful of salt and some lemon...?!?!
OMG YESSSSSS!!!!!!
And I'm eating a poptart and dairy free egg nog. How times have changed. 😁
Finally!! This is the only series I watch on this channel.
At first I thought you are going to steam the fish
I think that was too much salt!
Never Heard turbot before. I know it as just flounder.
I wish I could see it portioned on a plate. I've never eaten turbot. was the skin discarded?
yesssss new video
She did not just TUCK in the turbot
🙋👍👍😘
I like before I even watch
I'm sorry but is there a reason that you built a salt pyramid on the fishes face? LOL that was a lot of salt in one place!
That first is not even seasoned enough, just salt and barely any lemon. Oh no, the lobster sauce prob compensated for the lack of seasoning though I’m sure.
Would love to see how it's plated and served, looks delicious.
Why didn't she spread the salt? 😮
I can't eat boiled fish. It will be so soggy. But I like the video.
the SSALLTTT I love her
Youtube's a trip.
I wish she could tell us what it tastes like. Frankly, I'm not liking  the look of that fish.
I love that disappointing look she gives!
Hold me in your bussom😛
Omg a new video .....my wife thanks you !
5:06 lol she just tucked the turbot into bed 😂
huh, so next time I run into one of those I can point out that it's a turbot kettle
I wish I had my own kitchen maid!😂
yay yay yay brand new Mrs Crocombe videos!! It's Christmas all over again.
A good way to start the year is to watch a video of mrs crocombe :)
I love these chanel English heritage.
Love this 💓💕
I was wrris watching the interview with the actress our of character would ruin the magic for me but not a bit! She, and the whole production crew, are just so talented
I don't even eat any seafood,  still had to watch you!
2:28 that sass! 👌👌👌
How does one carve this fish? I love these videos but I want to see someone eating. Bring it to completion
She looks like that frightening substitute teacher. 😨
She tucked that fish into bed with a napkin lol
In bahasa melayu it's called 'ikan sebelah' or one sided fish.now i know what's the fish real name in English.
I LIVE for these videos
Missed these videos !
Now the comments r 1k 😛
whaaa you lost me at the lobster
Fact: Fish lack the neurological consciousness to feel pain because they don’t appear to have the specific pain receptors that we mammals including birds and reptiles confront.
My wig went under that napkin
Yaaaaassss
turbot is a halibut? that pot looks like a a steamer for bao and wow, i thought westerners never eat their fish as a whole with the head included because of how gnarly it looks for them. Seems like old victorian knows the best way to cook a fish. lol 😂
AVIS THE SALT
Just a boiled fish 💁
I love it when you guys shoot on a sunny day. Everything just looks so warm and homey~ I much prefer a slightly bright footage than a darker one with studio lights, looks a lot more natural. :) Mrs. Crocombe is such a delight to watch as she always is. And of course, I love her humor and the way she blanketed the turbot. It looks so cozy. ♥
When something like this was served, how many of them were served? I can’t imagine that one fish feeding many people.
Love how she put the napkin on the Turbot like she was tucking it into bed
English style turbot has a French name hahaha
SHE HAS HER OWN MAIDS 😂😂😂😂
Oh joy a new episode!
Turbot and flounder isn't da same?
I love her!
A day blessed with Avis Crocombe changes even the worst of days turn into a great day!
5:06 goodnight
No salt on that pidgeon pie thing...but salt here and all in one lump on the head of the fish thingy.
I think we all need kitchen maids. This makes me realize I can hire a guy in the home depot parking lot, why not in the grocery store lot?
I miss you Mrs Crocombe!
Yesss a new episode!
Alton Brown would absolutely detest that turbot kettle
I screamed I was so excited Mrs.crocrombe is my bish
Happy birthday to me for this video
This is a very expensive dish lol
this dish looks sad
I definitely won’t use cistern or piped water ma’am. That stern look she gives can get the rowdiest of scullery maids to clam down.
Turbot is so good
As usual .. nice video .. Please upload more
It must be a kind of sole fish.
I’d have to get a twin turbot kettle.  Arrrarrrarrr!
She tucked it in lol
3:09 DAMN !
Everything she cooks either looks gross or very expensive… Or a little bit of both😐😐😐
My fishmonger told me I'd be better off buying 6 Filet O Fish and replating them on china. Do you think the Mistress will notice?
Oh no thank you
We missed you
So it's boiled fish.
So cute, tucking the fish in for a nap at 5:07
these always make me so happy
1:10 is this a Peterson reference?
Where is mrs.crocombe's accent from?
The funny part, is England ruled all over the place to get spices and doesn't even know how to use , everything is literally boiled
2:28 dat 18th century shade doe.
I miss you so much Mrs C.
Great channel and love everything  normally but this is a little plain for my taste, is so sad they didn't  have  Turbot a la Donostiarra back then.
How long do you cook that fish?
Thanks just lost my appetite
I  want   to  learn  British  English   so baddd😂😂
Who else is addicted to these videos?
I love these videos
We love Mrs Crocombe! Another wonderful video.
Loooooove it! 🤗❤️
So basically  boiled fish
I like the way she talks
This is sublimeee
That looks so 😋😘
My idol💖
It's not a la anglais it's a l'anglais because it starts with a vowel
I am obsessed with this series! Greetings from Cape Town, South Africa.
Was turbot steamed or boiled?
Merry New Year Mrs Crocombe!
Just notice that old English uses so much French, especially in food
She's back! The Queen is back!
R.I.P The queen
Girl its 2019
I’m guessing the turbot is in the same family as the flounder? Do they taste alike as well?
😍😍😍😍
Yayayay she is backkk
Why would anyone dislike this?
It looks a bit like a flounder. I wonder how it tastes.
"SOME people"...:-)
I just watched the queen victoria and Albert bbc special and they made this as one of the many dishes for the feast.
I could watch these all day
Gordon Ramsey cameo anyone
I don't want to be harsh but after watching this dish I feel like puking...
Fantastic movie! Here at Y&S FOOD! we like to check out such type of content. We produce Travel & Food shows as well, world-wide, so we are continually searching inspirations as well as good ideas. Thank You.
“Far too expensive to be ruined” ohh how I missed her sassiness
It's basically a steamed fish but because mrs crocombe cooks it, it is 100x better!
へえーヨーロッパ人もこんなん食べるんやな、やっぱりええなシーフードは！
mrs crocombe is really 'THAT' bish
05:07 "Sweet dreams, fishy".
Wonderful! 🤗
"This fish is too expensive to ruin" Then dumps the salt unevenly.
Loooooool 😂
まんま蒸して、生臭そう
イギリスは内臓も取らんのか…
レモンを擦り付けるだけじゃヌメリも取れんだろう
God that fish is creepy.
I have never heard of a turbot.  But now I want to prepare one.  I live on the Florida coast.  I don't think they live here.
Yay she’s back!!!!! 💗💗
I love it when Mrs. C throws shade.
It’s that flounder? I’ve never heard of it called Turbot before.
That looks so not good
Grand fish that.
Looks revolting. Lol
I love this channel
All hail our Queen!
i'm hungry.....
🤮🤮🤮
I love Mrs. Crocombe she's my favorite. We need a new video of her at least once a week.
In German this fish is called Steinbutt and I always thought that's a funny word
it is easy to capture a turbot when fishing
One thing I like about these videos is that I learn about the existence of foods and ingredients I'd never heard of before. I had no idea turbot was a thing until watching this.
What if you’re at a dinner party and don’t like fish?
She is the pride of Victorians!
The view is so nice.
Aaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! Noooooooo!!! I wanted to see the sauce in action!!! 😩
I am addicted to this show
Anyone else drooling over that lobster sauce? I'd be ok just eating that if I had the chance!
Love these!
So what do you do with the food after filming the video? I would really love to see actual people eating each dish, then sort of telling us what it’s like. Sort of reviewing these Victorian recipes from a modern perspective :)
I cant be the only one that wants her to unbutton that top...for historical purposes, of course
...................huh
So this is what they cook in Elwynn Forest...
I love this woman
Aaaahhh lovelyyyy
Bernadette Banner made your gingerbread in a video, it was funny.
2:28 sis threw some heavy shade there
I hate how she says saurce
it was barely seasoned
So they really eat their turbot with all the bones in it? I suppose the aristrocacy to choke and blame the cook.
Mmm rodaballo a l'inglesa omnomnomnom
That's tithoug or flatfish in the US..
Omg a turbot kettle
Waste of time
Such a bore fish recipe
Well, look who's back
what does this fish taste like
So it is a flounder?
😍😍😍
I can only imagine how salty that fish is... I wouldn't know though I can't even EAT fish.
I had to google turbot fish.... so it is similar to a halibut... yum!
What the hell is cayurn pepper lol
It doesn't look delicious, sorry
It looks like a halibut fish
Isdang dapa
ONLY A PINCH OF CAYENNE
Where are these filmed at? Lol
I have never heard of turbot.
This is a lot more fancy then that fried fish sandwich I just ate
Damn she looking down on people who use their turbot kettle to cook puddings.
Anyone know a close alternative to Turbot that is sold in most US markets? I want to make yet another one of her dishes!
My lovely lady is back to make my day
❤️
Is a turbot the same as a flounder?
Love the shades!
And there she is... After long time..
I have wasted my time here
That waist is snatched hunny!
蒸しただけやん
It’s delicious I made it
What's roe?
y did she not spread the salt?
Wow how bland!
Otherwise boiled fish
So dump the salt on the eye of the fish?
Thank you
Now turbot can sleep with blanket....fish's acting suprb😅😅👌
Huh Good Night fishy im gonna eat you
Finally, new video !
As an Indian, I'm pretty sure that this will taste awfully bland to me....
Wow cool lol
Mmmm flounder
Awsome a new video 😁
Love Mrs Crocombe!!!
Can someone tell me why is this dish called english style turbot but its name is in french ? I mean I can't be the only one who sees the irony with that.
sorse
Does this fish have scales????
I love Mrs Crocombe💗💗💗
Awesome
Wonderful
YAY!  Mrs C's back!! ^_^
Now I am in need of a turbot kettle...
Mrs. Crocombe is hot.
would you please add one shoot that how to eat what you cook and how they use the   table utensils of that time
Yey new video!!!! Thank you!
That sure is one weird critter
Looks like something you’d see in the Rules  restaurant menu.  It’s the oldest restaurant in London
flat fish..
so just steamed fish, ok go it,
Gordon ramsay's mom
I love these videos!!!
Would be nice if we saw the Family eat the food at the table
Sod that.... I'll go to the chippy.
But... but. but where is Edgar? :'(
Oh hello!
❤️❤️
I don't understand this character. Is it supposed to be funny?
I feel like this woman is somehow insane... o.O
Атмосферненько! 👍
you walk into ur kitchen and ur mans steaming puddings in the turbot kettle wyd?
I feel like this must have been some 18th century way of directing the customers. "the queen eats it, you should too." I wonder what all things queen has been said to eat on regular back then..
what a horrible way to cook turbot is to boil it!
Oh my stars, she's back!!!! :)
That’s a really ugly fish wow 😰but the final dish looks yummy
Whoooo hooooooo.  Another awesome video.  Thank you
Though this dish is not my cup of tea, i still like watching this video countless times.
I had never heard of that type of fish, or had seen it. Is it black on one side and white on the other, or was something done to it? Also, why did she only pour salt on the fish's head?
Dear Englishmen! I’m from Russia and I don’t still speak English and therefore I use Google translator to write this comment. You are amazing, you and your country are just beautiful. I do not cease to enjoy it when I study. No matter how the political relations of our countries develop, I will still love your country. I will go through hell, but I will receive a visa and come. Obligatory. You know, we always welcome you here, despite what you think of us sometimes. We are not wild, and bears will not eat you :) I really want us to respect each other without paying attention to politics. We are simple people. Thank you for reading my emotional outburst))
Where am I gonna get a turbot kettle in Russia.
Well that was food porn!
вшіпгіе
Some of her pronunciations are interesting.  I wonder what British regional classification her accent falls under.
Soo bland it looks..... Ewieeee will not eat it..
I wonder what it tastes like?
I prefer my fish battered, fried and served with chips but I’m sure Mrs Crocombe wouldn’t approve of serving such fare to Lord and Lady Braybrooke.
I have an obsession with these I don’t know why , I don’t even cook.
How do you serve it ? Or how do people eat it?
why did she put a ridiculous amount of salt on only one inch of the fish ????  there's so much surface area left !!! also there is literally no other seasoning but except for salt an inch of the fishh
i’m so so happy she is back!!!!
I love her but no offence, that does not look tasty.
Do you not gut it before you cook it?  Am I missing something? 🤔
When she tucked it in like a little baby!!!
I don’t understand if this is some sort of parody or what.....it was kind of weird...
А с лобстером-то что? Куда этот соус?
I laughed when she put the napkin on top of the fish. Its like she was tucking it into bed or something
I'm thrilled about a new video, but I must say that is one UGLY fish!
I hate that she doesn’t taste the recipes
I find fish disgusting but somehow feel inclined to eat this
Why on earth would you pour half a cup of salt in one place on the fish?
It's just a boiled fish... Poor English
Turbots freak me out they look like stingrays 😣
Why does she remind me of Hermoine Granger.?
Another excellent video. I wonder if you please could make one about how to make jelly the victorian way by using some of those fancy cuppermoulds they used at that time.
Not hating or anything but just wondering if this is just a hobby or if they really live their everyday lives like this
How do they cook pudding in that turbot kettle though? Do they add a pan underneath that colander thingie to keep the ramekins away from the boiling water?

Dish looks nice. I'd probably try the sauce next time I steam fish.
What does the fistfull of salt do on the tubot's face? Turbot a la blanet.
Is there a reason why she is pronouncing an "r" in "sauce"?
is halibut ad turbot the same fish?
Do we have how to clean the dishes the Victorian way? I wonder about that.
That fish looks like a flounder.
Yummy.
I'm very confused. Why put diced lobster in something and then immediately strain it?
Did she just make a sauce with lobster and caviar? I don't know how I feel about that. Ill report back after I find out how much a turbot is.....Just as I thought....Ill cook this for Bill Gates after my billion dollar raise.
Okay, I'm genuinely a bit fascinated by her accent. She's doing something with /r/ for her Mrs. Crocombe which I assume denotes class and region, but to my American ear sounds randomly inserted (i.e., she consistently says "saurce" in this video and sometimes says "cayerne pepper") Where was Mrs. Crocombe from?
White people’s containers for seasonings are always full it’s sad
Great now I’m hungry
That's one ugly fish AF. But i like miss crombush shes lovely
She showed all those spices in jars yet only seasoned with salt? Ummm ok.
The ugliest things often taste the best.
did she add too many salt on turbot ?? it is going to be salti isnt it ??
Yay! She’s back! What does Turbot tastes like? How expensive?
I wonder what roe is?
Did she just tuck her pet fish in
Who is the intended audience for this recipe? Children? Historians? Scullery maids?! Nobody knows.
that is absolutely disgusting
Why does this British lady’s British accent sound fake?
Back when lobster was regarded as garbage
That looks gross..
that dead fish ... even when cooked ... looks sooo disgusting...
I bet in real life she find it kinda gross but she is a champ for making it
Does anyone else get annoyed when she dosent scrape leaves some of the ingredients on the plate
That is one of the worst fish to eat as it’s full of toxins
...huh. So if this dish is turbot served in the English style, then why is its name said in French? It’s like Capt. Jean-Luc Picard from “Star Trek: The Next Generation”: He’s apparently a French guy, but he speaks with an English accent.
0:10 also, do they have striped lawns in Victorian times? How?
I’m a big fan of movies like Julie and Julia, so I just had a crazy thought and I hope someone like the BBC considers it; a movie about Mrs. Crocombe. Nothing overly dramatic or any such nonsense just a movie about a woman and her love for food and the mastery of cooking in the Victorian period. I would recommend calling it Mrs. Crocombe’s cookbook. I know some people might think that there’s not enough material for a movie but I would invite them to look up a film called charms for the easy life, it’s a fictional story but it’s a simple story about a woman who practice medicine out of her home in North Carolina.
holy jeez 
i know the actress is trying so hard to make a British accent 
but her American accent seems to be more dominant
This recipe looks very tasty ! Fish dish in coming !
Can I be the pernickety french again ? It's just a detail, but you wouldn't say "Turbot à la anglaise", but "Turbot à l'anglaise" (pronounce the way Mrs Crocombe did, but with an l first : langlaise).
Taking Lobster with roe is illegal.
Mrs. Crocombe doesn't cares if you have a high blood pressure, that amount of salt...
I like this video, but that music was monotonous.
The appalling repeated background musical jingle renders this otherwise entertaining video all-but unwatchable.
I'm just wondering if that accent still used now in the UK? I've seen quite a few British talk show/TV series but not with that accent. Thanks!
Turbot is worth more than gold I swear! Her boy face makes her breasticles less appealing
Is this is a prank channel?
'À l'anglaise' not 'à la anglaise'. If it's supposed to be English style why did they give it a French name ?
From the look, I take it turbot is a type of flounder?
these always make me feel like an irish stableboy that grew up with the lord and lady’s 3rd son and who Mrs. Crocombe has a soft spot for, so she lets me come in the kitchen once I’m done mucking out the stables so that she can sit me down and talk about what she’s making while she gives me yesterday’s biscuits because she thinks I’m too skinny
She seems a lot peppier than usual in this video. I wonder if she sipped some extra brandy lol.
you know what would be the greatest gift ever? if you guys were to publish her cookbook...i would buy it in a heartbeat. I love this channel =]
We love reading all your comments and we’re sorry we don’t have time to answer all of them. 

Here are some answers to questions we get asked the most:

1. Plum was a generic term for dried fruit. Also sometimes nuts. Did you know a sugar plum is actually a sugared almond?

2. Suet is the hard fat which is found around the kidneys of an animal. Usually beef suet is used, but you can also use pig, lamb or indeed deer suet. You can also find various brands of vegetarian suet online

3. Hands are fine to use when mixing. Just make sure they are well washed. Many Victorian era recipes recommend using your hands for large amounts of mixture as it stops blisters that can be caused from using a spoon

4. Modern mixed spice is cinnamon, coriander, caraway, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. It's not dissimilar to pumpkin pie spice. The original recipe uses just nutmeg and mace
Mrs. Crocombe, always the boss in and out the kitchen. A true legend always beat for the gods, an organized and assertive queen. Waist is snatched, wig is layed.
"Mr Lincoln the butler will pour over hot brandy and set light to it when it's served. Then all the servants will take over the house, burning the entire of Audley End to the ground. REVOLUTION! REVOLUTION!.....I mean, Merry Christmas to all."
Mrs. Crocombe seems in very high spirits today.
Damm you ain't cooking plum pudding you making power puff girls XD
i love how everyone is stanning mrs crocombe, we need more stories of mrs crocombes adventures in audley end house.TBH THIS SHOULD BECOME A NETFLIX SHOW HAHA
Edgar's apples make an appearance once again!
This show is honestly so nice! Not only do you learn a little something, but it's also such a lovely show to watch~ It's so interesting, and calming. I would recommend to anyone interested in the Victorian era to watch! ❤️❤️❤️
We've been blessed!
"That's not very imaginative..." - Dead Man's Leg was very imaginative, and we SAW how you felt about that! :D
I was watching how to make cucumber ice cream when this came up. I love watching these!!!😆
Merry early Christmas  too I guess :D
I’ve been watching all of your older recipes over and over again!  
Thank God for a new one!!  
Would love to see more recipe uploads as well 🙏🙏😇😇
The godess of cooking is back
Our Kween is back
Am I the only one eying my larder cupboard and contemplating if I have enough ingredients at home to make one?
Who else lowkey kind of has a crush on Mrs crocombe
Stop everything! Another episode of Magic.
Master ate the holly ... died from holly poisoning.
1:35 I know that it was a long shot considering this was a pudding, but, I was hoping to hear "ourlmonds" on the list. Lol
.        Happy Christmas Mrs. Crocombe
i love watching these videos because they are lovely and well produced and Mrs C is a gem, but also because the English heritage comments section has to be the most wholesome on youtube
Can anyone explain why it's called plum pudding if there's no plums in it??
Shouldn't you use an edible garnish?  Holly berries are a bit on the poisonous side.
It wouldn't be a great week without Mrs. Crocombe
My family has been making Christmas pudding for the last few years and we love it... but this year I want to use this recipe, complete with the flaming brandy! It will certainly make for quite a show at the Christmas dinner. :D
Thank you so much for sharing! I always adore Mrs. Croocombe's inspiring and educational tutorials. <3
I was literally just planning a shopping trip for my Christmas pudding ingredients when this uploaded! Equally well-timed in that it's Stir Up Sunday this weekend, the traditional day for making the Christmas Pudding! ("Stir up" comes from the verse from the Anglican lectionary for the Sunday before Advent starts, and traditionally the pudding mixture is stirred by each member of the family so that they can make a wish for the coming year.)
Best birthday now that y’all posted a video 😍
These videos just make my heart feel warm❤️
Where did the bread crumbs and the salt go?
I'm convinced that someone created a time travel machine, met Mrs. Crocombe and introduced her to the modern world, saying that she would be rich if she made cooking videos and now that time traveler is going back everytime he needs a new video
Hii its 3.51am now.. Love ur channel.. Greetings from Malaysia🙋
I wait all year for these videos!!! Thanks so much for another lovely recipe Mrs. Crocombe! :)
BEST SERIES ON YOUTUBE
I love Christmas pudding
( can't believe no one has said that)
🤣🤣
I like that all of these videos always have subtitles!
If you let it boil dry she’ll know. That’s the power of mrs Crocombe.
Mrs. Crocombe knows best! If she says this is the best pudding recipe, it’s the one I’m making at Christmas.
Lord Braybrooke was a lucky man
I was not disappointed at the end when she lit it! I love this!!!
OoOohh!! 🙀 Mrs Crocombe's treating us for Christmas!! 😍❤
Mrs Crocombe, you have a lovely tan on Christmas morning— it’s a Christmas miracle!
Anyone knows any replacements for suet? I will be forever gratefull xx
Mrs. Crocombe 😍.
A post with an Avis Crocombe recipe! My day just got brighter. I plan to make this recipe.
My mother in law would make  one of these every year - but it would be made a while in advance and left to hang in the pantry - then on Christmas day it would be re-boiled. 
I never looked forward to it because it would often have a little mold on the boiling cloth that she would say "just scrape that off and it will be fine" ..... shudder. 
It was served with custard. 
The Christmas cake was made around the same time and would have a little brandy sprinkled over it every few days also.
My favorite has returned and with this delightful plum pudding. Merry Christmas, Mrs. Crocombe.
Gorgeous, now all it needs is some hard sauce; I'll be making some for my Christmas pudding for sure. Thank you and Happy Holidays. Cheers, Ardith
Yessss girl, gimmie the goods. Fill me with the Holiday spirit baby.
An early Christmas treat! Yay, thank you for this wonderful series 😍
Where is the Christmas Music in background....
It seems nice when it is there...
Also upload some more video.... love to watch Mrs. Crocombe....
And Merry Christmas...
She'not Mrs. Crocombe but for those loving these gems....watch the wonderful British tv series 1979.....the Duchess of Duke Street.
Another wonderful episode! Thank you!
I just love these videos. It would be such fun to sit and have tea with our lovely Mrs. Crocombe. I would hate to ruin the illusion for people who weren't interested, but I would love to know more about the lovely lady who plays our fair Mrs. Crocombe. What appealed to her about this role? What is her favorite part? Was she always a fan of Victorian culinary history? Regardless, give her my appreciative thoughts. Bringing history alive is one of the truest forms of teaching.
Next episode will feature our guest......21 Savage 😂😂😂👍🏼
You can see how they edit it when she plates it like only half came out and they put them together then cut to a brand new cake like THERE. LOVELY.
What kind of pigeon-livered zounderkite would dare give this a thumbs down??
Ugh! I'm late😢
Great video as always😁👌
Yesterday I made this pudding and it is delicious!
I cant stop watching these cause i love how it is so so so so unique from the others to learn some of these recipes 😇😇
it's after Thanksgiving and already i never clicked so fast
Well then...Merry Christmas everyone 😎
"but that's not very imaginative"

AAAHHHH I love this series!
When I was young, this was very much a tradition. My father would pour the brandy over and light it. Thanks for the memory.
Merry Christmas to you too Miss Crocombe!💖😊
Great episode as usual. Mrs Crocombe is a delight to watch as always. Great recipe. But I must say the lighting at the beginning up until the pudding leaves the oven feels a bit artificial (dark, orange, & studio like) as if she's cooking during night time. It loses that homey, warm feeling of the Victorian way episodes esp when the episode opens with the sun at the horizon. The ingredient shots were spot on though. When the pudding leaves the oven (4:41) the lighting brightens up and you get that homey feeling again before gradually dimming back. I assume it's due to weather/time factors & post-editing choices. Great episode nonetheless. Lovely series. Thank you for making these~
Me encantan sus vídeos. Sigan haciéndolos siempre. Saludos desde México.
Those copper cookware cost a fortune nowadays...love it!
Wait, no plums in the plum pudding/ Christmas puddling??
I always thought plum pudding had, you know, PLUMS in it.
another wonderful episode, really makes me long for Christmas!

edit: I accidentally tapped on this video again... oh why not just rewatch it :D
This reminds me of the "Boiled/Drowned baby" pudding.
Quite the morbid but I get where it gets the name haha.
I have some dried fruit in the pantry :) might give it a go.
Think lard will be a good substitute for suet?
I dunno but Crocombe sounds oddly similar to the modern day Crocker ... as in Betty Crocker
Beautiful and, I bet, quite tasty! Glad you set it afire for us! So lovely!
Ms. Crocombe's videos are so pure and warm, unlike any other videos on other channels
Something is different in this video...
The editing or lighting or camera ...I can't put my finger on it but something has changed for sure
Hello. I love these videos, so nicely put together.
Awwwwww love your channel, and subscribed!!!!!! 😁✌️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My Jamaican family always had this at Christmas!  Except we call it brandy cake and it’s served with brandy butter which is made of brandy, butter, and sugar.  I could forget the cake and just eat a whole pint full of the brandy butter tbh 😂😂
4:11 Mrs Crocombe does not approve of being unimaginative.
Lovely video.. We will try this recipe.  It looks fantastic , just in time for Christmas..Happy Holidays !  Enjoy our channel:  Irvine Spectrum California USA
It's like watching Downton Abbey's Mrs. Pattmore's youtube channel. I love it.
Also if someone asked me to sum up 18th century desserts, so far I would say: "dried fruits, suet, brandy" 😂 it looks yummy though!
I wish the makers and actors of this series a good health, and to never stop doing quality videos like this. Is such an amazing series and am glad it was on my recommendations. Merry Christmas everyone ❤🎄
Isn't Holly and its berries poisonous?   I would think that Mrs. Crocombe would never poison her employers.  Perhaps, the decoration is removed and no residue?

The lit pudding is very lovely indeed and I am sure scrumptious.
I was so surprised there no plums in plum puddjng.
Great video as always, glad you pinned the answer to the question I was thinking!
I really love this show! I'm in love with the victorian era!
Gorgeous! I wish I had a time machine sometimes, but these videos make me feel transported, to back then, just the same 😊💜. Love, love, LOVE your channel! 😊
Mrs Crocombe light the cake
-Me: Surprised pikachu´s face
Meu Deus! Eu amo esses vídeos!. ❤🇧🇷
I’ve thoroughly enjoyed watching your series. Thank you for producing such a quality video that is also historically accurate. 

This was filmed at a country estate. I am wondering if there was staff left at the country estate year round, even when the family was at there other home in London? It seems like they would have to, have someone to tend the land and gardens, someone to tend to the house.
I love these videos! The actress is so sympatico!!! And the recipes are fascinating
I live for these videos. Mrs. C is the OG MVP 💕 stay classy, queen 👑
Mom: I'm making pudding for, snack. 
Me: k I'm hungry 
Mom: but it will take 4 hours to cook so it will be our desser..
Me: okay..
4 hours later 
Mom: ice cream for dessert
"That's not very imaginative"... Mrs Crocombe throwing SHADE 👀👀👀
She's just so good at acting, she brings Mrs. Crocombe to life like nobody ever could 😙
My family and I love this series but, what happened to the "dry ingredients" in the recipe🤷🏽‍♀️?
I think Mr. Braybrook is really happy, because he has beautiful and brilliant cook like you, Mrs Crocombe. I'm respecting you.
I'm curious about cooking shows like these. Is Mrs. Crocombe's character really making these recipes, or is it mostly staged?
Watching these relaxes me so much and really informs me of how things were done then. It's wonderful and yes...i love Mrs Crocombe. she's a treasure.
How many puddings does our queen know?
Find out in the next episode on Discovery Channel




(it's a joke yall)
i love her!!!
I also went WOW!! When she lighted-up the pudding, looks so cool 😋
My favorite video so far, I want some Christmas pudding, Happy Christmas <3
I think you mixed up raisins and currents in the beginning
Mrs. Crocombe that waist is SNATCHEDT <3 love you and your channel!
"But that's not very imaginative"
LOL
Thank You for another episode I just love watching these segments! ❤️
Just think of how much more work it was for them to get those ingredients. It’s definitely not a trip to the grocery store! Such luxuries ♥️
I LOVE THIS RECIPES OMG. I want to eat all of thid
Beautiful! Gorgeous! I love that mold
It's also a plum pudding theory in chemistry.
I love the new camera angle from above ! 👌💖🍰
Your videos make me so happy every time I see a new upload with Mrs. Crocombe! These Christmas cookery recipes never fail to make me feel super festive! 🎅🏻🎅🏻🎅🏻
5 spice, all spice, mix spice how they differ from each other 😂😂😂
I am not a cook (ok, I can follow a recipe) but nonetheless find these videos relaxing to watch.
Costume drama and recipes! Whoever thought of combining the 2 is genius! I'm in love with Mrs. Crocombe. 😍 I also like the harvest stuff with Edgar. I'm so glad I found this channel.
Happy Yuletide Season Mrs. C! Im ready for more!
Was so excited when I saw this in my recommendations! Thank you YouTube gods!
I always get sad when a video comes to an end. This needs to be a regular mainstream series, hour long episodes at least! lol
I came as soon as I heard- Its wonderfuL
I want her to read a bed time storiesss for meeeeee omgggggg
Have you considerd introducing more caracters or givning some of the background-caracters lines
I love these videos keep up the good work.
The intro of the house and green grass with the sun behind always gets me. Imagine waking up in the morning and looking out the window to all that land. Beautiful!
It lit up beautifully! The shape of the mold made it so much more interesting to watch ❤️
these videos are wonderfully relaxing!
I love this because it's such simple ingredients, it probably tastes good, and you get to catch it on fire at the end
So happy to see that another video was uploaded. I enjoy these very much. Thank-you!!
So is there no plum in plum pudding?
we STAN a SKINNY QUEEN who INVENTED COOKING
Make another video about the garden with Edgar please! (I love these videos by the way)
I need an endless supply of Mrs. Crocombe videos to keep my sanity in check
There is something so comforting about Mrs. Crocombe's videos. I just love them.
Yay, you did make a proper Christmas pudding recipe video after all! I'm so glad as now I can make one this Sunday. ;) #MrsCrocombeMyHero!
Christmas is early!!!
What a wonderful recipe. Thank you ever so much! Such a pity we don't get suet where I live.
someone brought this to a potluck a few years back. It was alright. not my personal fav, but lighting it on fire was so much fun!
Im so glad you are making more of these videos...they are very interesting! THANK YOU!
I remember something like this from Downton Abbey. Its Sybils fave. ❤
4:11 SPILL THE TEA MRS. CROCOMBE!!! WE STAN A QUEEN
Oh my, I couldn't click that "like" button quick enough 💕
These videos make my day every time they come out.
I dont even like dried fruit cakes yet I loved watching this
Well,never see you for a long time. Good day ma'am.😁
As a post operative patient ...this is really for me very heathy has many fruits...thanks for a wonderful video...very relaxing and cool
All Mrs. Crocombe's recipes are imaginative...  Hahaha
Isnt holly poisonous, why on Earth would you actually heat that over food with fire?
Could someone help my poor memory? I'm 80% sure I saw a Mrs Crocombe video where she used mastic/mastix resin as a spice. I've recently come across some of the stuff and now I can't remember what the recipe was. Help?
Just wondering what the proper way to cut or serve it at a fancy house like the one she works at.  Thank you for these videos, very helpful!!!
I'd love to try this myself but there's no currants to be found anywhere in the US.
Liked the video even before watching it!👍🏻😃😂
This dish looked amazing & I'm willing to bet it tasted amazing too!
Why is it called plumb pudding. There's no plumb in it.
Just subscribed. I love everything about this video. The recipe, the kitchen, the clear instructions and the beautiful lady traditionally dressed. ☺
The plum pudding / Christmas pudding is no doubt a delight, bit it pales in comparison to the utterly delightful Avis Crocombe.
I love watching your videos. Please keep up the good work 😊
Hi I don't understand how it's plum pudding if no plums are present love your show thanks sooo much🍭🍒🌲
Apart from being British myself, I love her voice. It's soothing and nice to listen to. Not only that, but the videos are great too, keep up the great work 💕
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL,  I Love your recipes, I will try some they sound so yummy I love all types of puddings
Yay, a new video !! Happy Holiday Season to Mrs. Crocombe & Co !!!🎉
My goodness the sound and film design! Oh the sound was simply amazing! You have a fantastic team working for you guys!
She returns!
Holly? Nothing like hemlock to make a pudding great.
oh, she did it again: she made me smile for 6 minutes
Im a spanish Bakery Student and i love this videos, They help me a lot to understand the English pastry and its differences with the Spanish.
I just resized our Jamaican fruitcake/Christmas cake is a hybrid of the Victorian  Christmas cake and Victorian Christmas pudding.🇯🇲
ahhh  the music sounds like home 💖💖💖

makes me wanna drink tea in peace. 
the chimes are synonymous to ms crocombe now.

that aside,  i'd love to try making this fancy flaming plum puddin,  yum 💖

also, 'ｂｕｔ  ｔｈａｔ＇ｓ  ｎｏｔ   ｖｅｒｙ
 ｉｍａｇｉｎａｔｉｖｅ '  👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
I was gonna make this until I heard steam it for 4 hours xD
Always love these!!!
Amazing 😍takes you back in time.
Looks lovely but that mould was much more likely to be used for jellies, mousses and ices. The canonball shape is the preferred one for a Christmas pudding.
Happy blinking Did you intend this as a Thanksgiving present? 👏👏😊
Dear Ms. Crocombe
.
.
Tasty left the chat
.
.
With love, the Internet
I liked the last scene when you put the fire into the pudding..makes me "wooww!!!" A little bit magic..😍😍😍🎁
Lovely!  I always enjoy these episodes; thank you.  Last year, I used my pressure cooker to boil the pudding. It took one hour compared to the longer version.  This year, I'm finding out that suet is hard to find, so no pudding, but a fruitcake instead.
when the music starts you can finally say "yes.. she's back.." ❤️
I don't watch for the recipes, but these videos are so soothing and comforting
She called out salt in ingredient list but never added it.
The leaves used for top decoration is very poisonous
was doing great until that spoon scrape right after the candied peel >_<;
Is that the pudding seen in A Christmas Carol?  Also... why are there no plums in plum pudding?
Can you please upload these more often? So soothing.
We want a mrs Crocombe recepies book!
Omg Mrs Crocombe is my kitchen Icon for life, time to test some of her recipes
Wait so there's no actual plums in it?
Or at least my understanding of what a plum is
Feeling warm ❤
This is modern cookery for our times , for the 1880s this was witchcraft
So wait. Brits just mush things into a mold with cake batter and call it pudding?
It's beautiful! The lighting of the pudding is a show stopper. I will do that! I'll turn the lights off, and show it off like some kind of a magic trick.
I love watching your video. Your voice is relaxing.  :)
Reccomended this channel to all my friends who struggle to learn English.
4:15 Love it when Mrs. Crocombe throws shade lmao.
I'm so impressed by his channel. Love the aesthetic of it.
Lmfao😂😂😂😂💀💀
she looks like the principal (Agatha Trunchbull) in the movie Matilda😅
First time I've actually noticed salt being used as an ingredient.
Holly is a poisonous plant, better use a plastic one for decor
I miss you <3
Thanks to American portion sizes, I have no clue how many servings this dish is
Absolutely one of my favorite channels on here! Love these videos!😍
I LOVE that Mrs. Crocombe is the FIRST to wish me a MERRY CHRISTMAS 2018! I just LOVE the acoustics of this Country House kitchen... the sound is so appealing to me it takes me there! Just one of the countless things I love about these videos.
Looks a bit like the one my cousin's grandmother used to make.
THIS WOMAN IS A NATIONAL TREASURER!!!!!!!!! I freakin love her!
Oh.. You kinda look like Lady Gaga, miss Crocombe
Funny how it's called plum pudding, but there's no plums in it.  Haha.  

Aren't hollies poisonous?  It's not like y'all are going to eat it, but it's next to food that y'all will be eating.
maravilloso and i love the victoryan way
I just love how miss C present the food.
Such utensils.....where we can find them now....my Grandmother had such things in her kitchen but now I keep searching for them...especially the enameled plates and bowls....hope to find them one day...
i loved when she lit the pudding. it looked like northern lights were flashing above it💕
I have gotten thoroughly stuck watching every episode on this channel. I've tried to turn away to no avail.
Team cucumber 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Oh, no contact mic, gotta day I like the sound of the actual cooking in the backdrop but that eco is grating
wait, there aren't any PLUMS in plum pudding?!
Mrs. Patmore and Daisy could cook circles around this woman!!!!
wait a minute...this is a reupload!
I love Christmas pudding but no peel for me please I'm just not a fan of it.👍
Merry Christmas Mrs. Crocombe!   I hope this won't be the only Christmas special you'll grace us with.  How I wish I could have you fix my family and I a plum pudding at Audley House. Thank you!
Mrs. Crocombe seems especially happy today
this is what is good and genuine food, no what is served in the world now !!
Is anyone else attracted to her?
They put a lot of alcohol in their recipes I’ve noticed hahaa
Ahh plum pudding.... Food in almost every British stories
Joyëux  Noël à vous Madame Crocombe  Greetings from the Charente Maritime , Happy Christmas to all the fans of the lady .
Yay I love her and her cooking as well
I’ve never clicked so fast in my life 😇
And season's greetings to the entire team, Lord and Lady Braybrooke, Mrs. Crocombe, Sylvia, Edgar and the entire staff of Audley End House. Are the Townsends going to send their greetings?
I would buy the heck out of a shirt or mug (or something) that said "For this recipe you will need..."
Is this a reupload? I swear I have seen it before.
The Christmas pudding has become a part or the traditional Christmas desserts in North of France due to exchanges with english travellers. In Boulogne-sur-Mer, where I'm from, every woman makes Christmas pudding
People if your going to decorate with holly be warned it’s poisonous and don’t ever eat the berries
no chopped armonds in this recipe
You’re quite the handsome woman.
Oh, how I've missed you!
Yes work it mrs crocombe
My favorite pudding. Merry Christmas to you Mrs Crocombe
Joyëux Noël à vous Madame Crocombe and greetings from the Charente Maritime , Happy Christmas to all the fans of Madame Crocombe
I wonder, is this a play pretend? Or is she really serving? Omg I feel like I just relived the 1800 era. 😱😱
No plum in plum pudding? Interesting!
What is suet? 1st time seeing a video like this...and looking forward to more!
that flame was absolutely beautiful. Until now I've always felt the whole 'light your dessert on fire' thing was a pointless gimmick.
This recipe is quite similar to my great grandmother's one.  Been a holiday tradition for several generations now.
Yeaah my Mrs. Crocombe cooking video supply is here!🙌🏼🙌🏼❤️ Also, my question: what should be the appropriate substitute for brandy? Bc i don't drink alcohol😁
I’m a Study Abroad student from the US and my host parents in London made us a Christmas pudding resently as well! It doesn’t look nearly as fancy as Mrs. Crocombe’s pudding though but it tasted really good! Love the videos!!! 💕
5:19 how did she do that? It looked so cool
I adore these videos. I have my three nieces watching them as well. Happy Christmas to you and yours!
There are no plums in plum pudding?
This lady is an excellent actress. She is simply delightful to watch. One feels as though one is right there in the kitchen with her!
What accent does this, "our",
 Mrs Crocombe have? Which region?
Wow, that is a "little" spice indeed
Just curious why you lit fire on pudding??
😊
Happiness aura of Mrs. Crocombe strikes again!
The LEGEND. The ICON.... yes
I LOVEEEEE how this is filmed!
Is it me, or does it look like Mrs. Crocombe has lost a bit of weight?!
When she lit it on fire I literally gagged 🤩😱♥️
When it was lit on fire I jumped
Raisins 🤮🤮🤮
Is it wrong that I sort of ship Mrs. Crocombe with The guy from Townsends youtube channel?
Love Mrs Crocombe, but it's only November, bit early for Christmas pudding!
I can't stand Christmas pudding but I'm happy to watch Mrs. Crocombe make one.
Another great ep watched ^-^ ♡ keep it up hehe
It's very lovely to see her cooking.
Plum pudding with no plum in sight! I love these Mrs Crocombe videos - keep them coming EH!
the recipe so easy and look delicious that I tempted to try it, so I can share it with my friends!! but I'm from Indonesia, and we can't find suet easily. Also when I search what is Suet, I found it's derived from animal, and I'm afraid it's get or mixed from Pig ones, which is not Halal for my moslem friends. so can we substitute suet with something?

ohhhh, can't wait to try it!
I adore these videos! I got my three nieces watching them as well. Happy Christmas to you and yours!
These are so much fun, thank you ❤
I seriously love this show!!
WHY SHE LIGHT IT ON FIRE?!?!?
I wish we had suet like that in the USA. I would LOVE to make english style puddings here in Michigan. Nom Nom!!
I think u got the currents and raisins mixed up...
Love learning about others cultures, history, and traditions. This makes it so fun. It kinda reminds me of the series Great Depression cooking on youtube made by a woman who lived through it. Always a treat to watch these. Merry Christmas
..I've heard you store all the dry ingredients in your blouse...Is that true?
Glad a new cooking video uploaded. I wonder if a Christmas cake would come out soon. Besides, may i know how they celebrate the Christmas back then, it would be interesting to watch for sure!
Love the series.. Highly doubt they weighed the ingredients though
These videos are work of art....There should be a museum for these!
Fascinating!!! Love these videos
I will drop ANYTHING to watch these
When you want to do something for Thanksgiving, but your character is supposed to be British
T H I C C
Pudding in Germany is custard lol weird for me to see something else instead
Yes a new video from you!!
lmao the enthusiasm in the intro caught me off guard. mrs. crocombe been hitting the cider?
Yay, you lit it on fire!🔥I was hoping you'd do that. I'm guessing it's safe to burn the holly that is on top of it. How long would you light it for?
Could you do a tutorial on how to make Candied Peel?
When do you add the salt? Lol
a wonderfully simple receipt
Did they also use to light it on fire like that? That was great 😂
Sensational
I find this baker charming, if it is polit to say so.
Love your series and all the wonderful recipes. Wonder why this is a plum pudding when there are no plums in it?
😍😍😍😍 is this diffused on BBC this year ? 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Send some of that in a care package to the boys at Rorke's Drift.  They could use some cheer...
Isn't this marvelous 🤗
WE love your videos,Keep them coming....!
I always Love it this recipe
Dont you think you need to give us another Mrs. Crocombe's cooking video for Christmas??? We're in the middle of December alreaddyyyy
these videos are so relaxing
I will surely try to make this pudding with this recipe. I feel this is going to be a little bit different from normal Christmas pudding we see in markets.
May I ask what suet is?
Perfect as always Mrs C
No plums in plum pudding!?!
Love the content ❤️
Whym's it called plum puddin' if it ain't got no plums in it?
"OOOOOOOOOHHH"
5:13 she was so satisfied with the pudding...lol
Yehey! Another amazing video :)
I’m not brave enough to try suet 😂
So happy to see these amazing videos... I feel like it's Christmas already❤️❤️❤️🎅🏽 🌲
Yass she's back more frequently
No plums?
Holly berries are poisonous. Lightning them on fire above your food doesn't make good sense.
If anyone wanted to make this at home, but didn't have the suet, a close second is to freeze a mixing bowl, butter or veg shortening. Use a cheese grater to grate the butter and the cold bowl will help keep it chilled while mixing.

If mixing with your hands, do not over mix. Basically, mix it until blended, but after a minute or two your hands will melt the butter or shortening, which will make it very dense.
Boil it in cloth? Hmm sounds a lot like dead mans leg to me 👀
I'd love to serve this to Mr. Colin Bridgerton!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH C:
Anyone else agrees with that we'll never make it but they are amazing at
I loooove the mold!😍😍😍
Anybody else thought the cake was on fire in the thumbnail??? Is it just meee??
The echo was noticeable in this one and the camera work when the pudding was being wrapped was quite spastic.  Not quite up to the usual standard I’ve seen from you guys but it’s always lovely to see this lady.
I don't understand British accents. Why is "almond" pronounced like "armond", but "plum" isn't pronounced like "prum"?
Is one pudding a single Serving?
I jumped for joy when she lit it.   LOL
beautiful, masterpiece
She's such a great cook! Merry Christmas, Mrs. Crocombe!!
Gordon Ramsay would put her cooking to shame
The puddings on fire!!
never in my life have I've seen a pudding on fire
I like the new layout very much:)
Another new video, another new blessing!!!
5:20  🔥🔥🔥
Currants are illegal in the U.S 😥
Thank you for another video.
I know it literally doesn’t matter, but is anyone else being driven crazy by the fact that the shot of the raisins and currants are switched during the ingredient roll call? Like, am I crazy??
I can already feel the taste of Christmas in my mouth.
I love the copper molds and dishes. The molds are so beautiful   and look amazing even when not in use.
Beautiful cake but holly is poisonous
Sweet laxative for rich ppl.
I love how all those sounds except for her voice are howling. They give some idea of how grand the kitchen of Audley End House is!
Merry Christmas Mrs. Crocombe :)
Ugh! I’ve missed her so much 😭
I really want that mold though, I've never seen that kind of mold in my place....
That was beautiful.
Why are there no plums in your so called plum pudding? Is this the sort of double dealing that led to Brexit? So many questions...
As an American, I think this is a cool way to learn about British culture, even if it's traditional instead of modern
Scones recipe please😁
2:56 - 3:00 oh. no.
raisins and currents were switched?
I love the mold！😂😂
the best actor
Merry Christmas everyone! 🎄
Your videos are sooo relaxing. It's like watching a bob ross painting video.
Oh hooray! My favorite cook ❤
Oms..... I wish these videos were longer! I love watching them!
I would be fun seeing some of the outtakes/bloopers from this series!
What is it at 4:34? A kind of clock or something? It looks gorgeous <3
I love Mrs Crocombe's cooking videos! :D
PS. Holly is just a garnish. Do not eat!

Swallowing hollyberries can cause vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and drowsiness
Damn even back in the days people celebrated christmas way before christmas XD
Thumbs up because it's cooking plus British history. Win win.
it is very similar to our traditional Scottish dumpling that we make every christmas
But...there are no plums in it. I have gone to a sad place because of this. ????
I luv ur traditional recipes
Yay! I'm so early.
I love the Christmas recipes the best I think 🎄
I love tht woman <3 I love this Chanel <3
I can watch the 10 hours version of these videos
can this stuff be found at walmart?
Hello, I’m from Mexico. Actually I’m learnig English and I love all about England. Your videos are lovely, I really enjoy them.
Thank you. I'm going to try this. Even though I don't know what diet is, yet.
Love from a Norwegian subscriber
I love seeing Mrs. Crocombe she always brings me a smile and delicious recipes. Recently I’ve been ill and it certainly hasn’t felt like Christmas. But seeing her make Christmas pudding cheered me up so. Thank you
She reminds me of Mrs Donahue from the Middle😂
she set fire to the cake i-
Victorian cooking is just divine!
Merry Christmas and Happy Thanksgiving from your friends in the USA!
0:04 "WOOAA" what a way to start christmas
I met "Mrs Crocombe" a few months ago and she was so nice and sweet
i wonder what people back then would say if they saw modern day pudding
Yay she is back!!  My favorite videos on this channel.
I love her and her cooking!
I stan this woman
Isn’t holly poison.
These comments are so kind and supportive lmao I love Mrs. Crocombe's influence on us all
Golly that looks soooo good. 😋
A fine start to a day 😊
2:49 A S M R
Directly googled "suet" after hearing it for the first time.
Wished you had been there to make the Christmas pudding I made when I was young, the brandy didn't ignite as well as I thought it should so I used lighter fluid, it went up alright and knackered the pudding
When I was a kid my auntie was working on the U.K. , every years she brings "we call English pudding " and I love it....is sooooo good ...now I know is Christmas pudding...so cool...I have to do this ...
OOOOoooooh!
I was about to say, "Why is she mixing with her hands and not a mixer or whisk?" Then I remembered again. Victorian times.
When i think about english pastries, this cake is exactly what i think about. Cliché in the best way it exists !
Don't fail to be imaginative!!! Also would you have cream poured over a pudding like this?
We use pudding cloth and hang for about 6 weeks..
I'm American, but my dad is from England, and so I made this as a Christmas gift to him. I was a little nervous, as I've never made a steamed pudding in my life--and indeed, it took two tries to get it right!--but it turned out very well. And it made my dad so happy! His face lit up when he unwrapped it and he exclaimed, "Is that figgy pudding?! I haven't had that since I was a kid!"
Thanks for such a great recipe, and I hope you had a wonderful Christmas season. 

And for my fellow Americans who want to try this, too, here are the measurements I used:

1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup breadcrumbs
1 cup suet (or shortening, which is what I used)
1 cup raisins
1 cup currants
1 large apple, peeled and chopped
2/3 cup white sugar
1/2 cup candied orange peel
1/2 t. cinnamon
1/2 t. coriander
1/2 t. caraway
1/2 t. nutmeg
1/2 t. ginger
1/2 t. cloves 
A pinch of salt
1/3 cup brandy
3 eggs
Looking forward to making this on stir-up Sunday tomorrow!
Yes!!!! Light it on fire!!!!! F I R E !!!!!!
First of all, no T for this episode? I mean the recipe is good but we need Audley-End scalding hot T, all T all shade... 

Second, why is their cuisine obsessed with boiling, steaming, or poaching flour mixture? Im sooo confused...
It looked amazing!
All of them are your favorite reciepes :)))
Suet?
A great recipe, but I like to add chopped prunes, sultanas, glace cherries, some ground almonds, and a damn sight more brandy than shown here, plus a good glug of sherry, single malt whisky, and a splash of Guinness.
I'm now thinking of "Hercule Poiroit's Christmas", set in just such a house as this. The pudding will keep for weeks, won't it, with all that sugar and alcohol.
bless our english sister mrs crocombe
 xx
Now i must book a travel to Audley End House but traveling in time thanks to youtube and preparing something at home will do for now.
Almost looks like the currants and raisins have been switched when she is describing them
I saw in the clip that the plum pudding is on fire, its amazing. Is it because of brandy?
“Raisins....” ok next video.
Can you please make scones like the ones at Tintagel Castle?  They really are the beat scones in the world!!!!!
My girl🤗🤗🤗🤗
I knew suet was going to be an ingredient right before they showed it.
There should be a restaurant where you can get all these amazing dishes. Prepared the same way and served in costumes. That would be perfect _
We missed you Ms.Crocomber
Whats the brandy for? I always see her use that?
Does anyone actually eat plum pudding nowdays?
She looks so excited when cooking. I love it!
This pudding is simply glorious!
😁😁😩😩🤭🤮💗🥂
I live for this
Slice and taste please
I love these videos.
Mrs. Crocombe = LIFE

Also, I'm going to try and make this but I was wondering if there are non-alcoholic alternatives for brandy by any chance?
Прелесть..
everytime I watch these videos I have to search "suet", I dont speak english and thats a weird word to me LOL
Thank God for Mrs. Crocombe.
OMG....Im in love 😈
YAY SHES BACK!
I made this and omg, it turned out so delicious!
If you cannot find suet, what can be used instead?
She forgot the pinch of salt :(
I think it's interesting that the measurements are given by weight.  In the US, we go by volume.  I don't know how to go about converting the measurements since they're on different standards.  A cup of sugar doesn't weigh the same as a cup of flour or a cup of ground beef.  Do you have scales in your kitchens in England?  Do I need to buy one if I want to make these recipes?
I treasure these videos!
As soon as I see a new episode, I know it’s time for a little break with some good tea!
I'd love to see one more Christmas video this year, maybe roast goose with chestnut dressing?
Woah what happened to the Christmas pudding when she lit it up at 5:21?
we need more!!!
Bread crumbs?
Damn it I'm hungry now
Fascinante dama , candied pell? orange or lemon? gracias ,felicidades.
the flame trick looks like it's a party fave
I shall try, thank you.
it looks like an extremely moist raisin and spice bread.
okay, but why is it called plum pudding if theres no plums in it?
It lights up so pretty!
Where are the plums??
YEAAAAAAAH! I'm so glad she's back !!
Got raisins and currents around the wrong way. Just an observation.
Plum pudding? No plums...
The flames on the molded shape were awesome.
The thumbnail doe
I’d have loved to have seen the original measurements rather than grams... in any case I’d be surprised if they weren’t using the same pounds and ounces we’re used to today!
Masterful as always!
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
How to fry an egg by Mrs Crocombe. 1 egg, a pinch of salt, BRANDY
That ending OMG
I wonder if you could make a plum pudding that actually contains dried plums?  It seems logical that you could, since prunes are unequivocally dried fruit, so why not?
so currants are raisins and raisins are currants in GB? no wonder they didnt like european regulations on produce....
Merry Christmas.
It looks so gooooood
I always love these videos! But I’m wondering where the flour and bread crumbs come in. Did I miss it??
There is a brandy sauce that goes quite well with this.
looks great
What is mixed spice?
Christmas came early!
I love all your recipes!! They’re sooo cool!!
what kind of accent does she have?
I didn't know what suet was
I regret googling it
It looks like a tree. Beautiful.
I could watch these all day
Wwaaahh!!! Mrs. Crocombe!!!!
I need more Mrs Crocomb, she completes me!
Very nice. I love it when food gets set on fire at the table.
Please keep making these videos!
Waaaaawwwww
i just love this
Where's the plums???
I love these 😻
Happy early Christmas Mrs.C
Who else loves the music to these videos?
I love this video ❤
Wonderful. Where can I purchase a set of the small white bowls with blue trim?
It really bugs me sometimes how Mrs. Crocombe uses a lot of non-edibles (flowers, plants, leaves) as garnishing. Is it a Victorian thing?
very pretty u are quite artistic in your baking!
like it  showing living  history
Someone please get this amazing woman her own show!
Omg that looks soooooo good!!
I watch these videos over and over again. Sometimes checking out the shelves behind her!
I'm the 47th comment
I love me some Mrs Crocombe!
I didn’t see you add the breadcrumbs
So lovely! Thank you.
Did I miss it, or where went the breadcrumbs?
Isn't holly poisonous?
Thank you very much!
I want to see it cut into and how it would have been served.
Suet? What's that?
Are those holly berries? I thioght they were toxic.
When u realise Mrs crocombe was probably in the chronicles of narnia the Lion the witch and the wardrobe movie
5:20 why did it glitch
heaven 💖😘🌹🌹
That's not very imaginative. Looks at you with look of Disappointment
"Hooooh!" Lol
I couldn't wait to watch this one!!!!!
Is this a type of fruitcake?
Is it just me or does Mrs. Crocombe always sound like she's 2 seconds away from snapping and bashing your head in with one of her heavy pots? O-O;
Unfortunately, you lost me at raisins. Only thing I like raisins in is raisin bran. Still looks tasty, though.
Why is it called plum pudding if there aren’t any plums in it?
Definitely a recipe I want  to try making . Many years ago my late aunt would make Christmas pudding and we would receive one for many years . I wish I new what recipe she used .
We stan Mrs. Crocombe
My Great-Grandmother used to make these puddings long before Christmas and usually with Rum and Scotch as well as Brandy too. I think they keep well for a few months so don't wait til Christmas to make em folks. Maturation is key.
The setting fire to the pudding trick was nifty. I wonder if it enhances the taste.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 🎄
Warning.. do not watch while hungry..
Looks delicios! Where did you learn to make it?
It’s so nice not to see plastic! Makes you think that we don’t need to use plastic either.
I should very much like t know how Mrs. Crocombe makes her candied peel.  Could you make that a future episode, please?
Beautiful!
Sis where was the plum?
Was there ever any plum in it?
I wonder how they did all the measurements back then? Was it this specific in grams or was it more in ratios and experience. Did they use a balance with weight to get exact grams if they did do it by exact weight?
Christmas has come early!
Victorian food didn't look appetizing for most part, but it's just great to see so many old recipes coming to life in this series. Mrs Crocombe is also very entertaining and nice to listen to. Thank you English Heritage for these videos.:D
Thank you!
This woman is so fabulous and her cooking and acting are top notch as well, she really brings Mrs Crocombe to life.
so sassy i love it
1:25 I see something in the salt bowl....unacceptable.
No  plastic!
Lovely, 😍
❤
Yes!!!!!!  She's back!!! 😄
Excellent presentation.
That was tuff
Isn’t holly poisonous?
Money shot: 5:17
I love that Mrs Crocombe.  I'd love to kick it and cook with her.
Nice to see you mrs crocombe
Why is it so middleaged
A NEW MRS. CROCOMBE VIDEO 😮🙌🎉
IT'S NOVEMBER
How come it has no plums?
Its looks good
Sugar is actually a wet ingredient
Oh wow! We have a National Plum Pudding Day in February. Another excuse to make it. :)
wow! that looks scrumptious!
where do u live
I want that yellow bowl.
Чудесные видео! Я с удовольствием смотрю - словно нахожусь на кухне королевы! Прелесть!
My dad was Scottish so I grew up eating Plum Pudding from a very young age. My mother did not like to make anything sweet bake or Steam so every year we had Crosse & Blackwell plum pudding with what was called hard sauce. The sauce was a concoction of sugar Brandy and butter which came in a small jar. As soon as I began to bake I started making Christmas pudding and when I lived in the UK for over 15 years of course I made it every year. Is one of my favorite things about Christmas. :-)
She reminds me of Hermoine Granger.  🙄😓
This is love... 🍰🍰
I used to really enjoy watching these videos but find now that the portion up front with a five-second shot of each ingredient is really tedious.  Please go back to the previous way of describing ingredients that doesn't take up a big chunk of the video.  I'd rather watch more of Mrs. Crocombe than an endless series of shots of ingredients cascading slow-mo into a bowl.
Que tengo yo que ver con la cultura Inglesa  . Nada pero me encantas con la presentación  que haces es que pareces de esa época es que es Real de veras gracias es muy buen trabajo  nuevamente  muchas gracias
I'm addicted to these videos
What about drinks too ? X
Is it just me or her accent is actually sounds a bit weird that it's not fully British? Made me think like she is an American and does the accent for the content but I'm not a native English speaker so I can't say an exact thing. She is adorable, don't get me wrong lol I'm just really curious right now
Please tell what spices the mixed spice contain?
What is a suet?
And what all is in the mixed spice?
Love it😊
Ahhhhhhhh I just love these. Always wish they were longer. Such wonder!
I need to steam my desserts. :) (What what is "mixed spice"?)
Isn't this the third Christmas pudding video?
Why does it turn in fire?
Haag puding
WHAT'S SUET PLEASE...TELL US.

LOVE THESE VIDS.
She forgot the salt!
Why does she have so much resentment towards currants
In future videos please explain some of the ingredients on what they are?  I have no idea on some listed on this episode.   Like what is suet, or candied peel?  Also what is currents?  I'm from the USA and never heard of these before.  Oh yeah also what is castor sugar?  Is it the same as granulated sugar?  So if you don't mind please explain what they are?  Thanks. 😄
I just had to share that I made this recipe, although I had to tweak it a little since I could not find any dried currants where I live... I decided that I would put in another variety of raisins, some chopped dried figs, some chopped dried apricots, some dried cranberries & some dried cherries... It turned out amazing! it would have been amazing even without the extra things I put in to make up for the lack of currants 😊 thank you so much for sharing this, thank you for your hard work, and thank you for helping me make an amazing pudding!
Thanks for sharing. I’m a Sugar-free Plant based eater. I would not know how I would survive that time.
Can someone please explain how did it become engulfed in BLUE FLAMES?
magic cake 😍
Brilliant
👍👏
I love those gorgeous copper pots <3 ! Mrs Crocombe knew how to choose her kitchen things.  
Also I would have been so afraid of the pudding getting stucked in the form, but she made it with no effort.
#MerryChristmas🎁🛍🎄
Bom dia
Mouth watering.
isnt holly poisonous!
Suet?
She's much happier in this one
Ms crocombe we miss u
Looks delish
So Flour is one of the ingredients. But she never uses flour while making the pudding.
So when are we getting the cookbook?
Is the actress actually english????
very traditional and something i would like to try
That I watched this is a testament to how enjoyable this series is. I loathe Christmas pudding so much (and mince pies, and fruit cake, and wedding cake – pretty much every raisin and peel laden Victorian pudding recipe) it makes my face involuntarily crinkle up when I think of it... Please make more with Mrs Crocombe and with the gardener's assistant and the groom... Also please consider making an 18th-century series. That would be lovely. xx
she looks more excited in this video, i guess mrs. crocombe is quite a christmas person XD
From where i came from, i think they call it fruitcake.
Do you make your own candied peel or do you buy it somewhere? I want to try to make this pudding sometime =D
Hope you had a WONDERFUL THANKSGIVING young lady. Funny, I thought currants were raisons...lol hope to see ya before christmas.🎅🌲🎅🌲🎅🌲
Take me back to these times pleaaassssseee
her movement looks kinda harsh lol
Did anyone notice she forgot to add salt? 😁😁😏
What about the breadcrumbs...?
My father made this every Christmas. I never ate it because it had animal suet in it (I had no idea there was such a thing as vegetarian suet), but it always smelled so good.  He made a white sauce to go over it and he made quite a presentation when offering it to the table.  It was a big deal in our house.  I'm glad to see someone make it again. It brings back very good memories. On a side note, I made the Christmas cake from last year's holiday video and it was amazing.  It is the new tradition in my house now. I love Mrs. Crocombe.
looks yum
Very surprised they used the metric system in Victorian Britain 😉
dare i say, chocolate sand castle
01:04 American accent :D
No servants shading this time.
I would watch a full length show of Mrs. Crocombe. There wouldn't even need to be any dramatic plot or anything. I'd happily just watch her cook and keep the kitchen helpers busy and out of trouble.
how and why was the pudding set on fire? @_@
Why is it called plum pudding if there is no plums in it?
What is the purpose of lighting a fire on that pudding? Does it enhance the taste?
Is it ok to eat the fire?
Is the mixed spice all spice? Even my Mom doesn't know what what it is.
Please teach me the secrets of the kitchen, Mrs. Crocombe!
I would love  lemonade video, how did they make it back in Victorian era? Or is it a mainly colonial American drink?
She's  Awesome 💛👑💛
But... there wasn't any plum in it.
if we don't use or have SUET ,what can we use ? BUTTER ?
Interesting to think that traditionally plum puddings were eaten throughout winter, not just at Christmas. That looks a lot like my great-grandmother's Christmas pudding - not so dark as we expect today, modern puds include black treacle for that rich dark look and taste.
God has arrived
That looks so cool!!!!!! And delicious
Nie porzeczki a koryntki (odmiana rodzynek)! to zasadnicza różnica. Brytyjczycy rozróżniają: rodzynki, koryntki i sułtanki.
0:05 every store in 1st november
What is in "mixed spice"?  Suet is bird food in the US. Where do I get the right kind of suet in US? I guess I will read through comments and see if others have asked. My husband is from Ireland and I would like to make one from scratch
I wanna see mrs crocomb time travel and cook some crazy food sciencey dishes
Pity we had no chance to see the piece of it being cut out so that we could see what it should be like...
What is mixed spice? These videos are nice and a lot of trouble goes 
into them ..so is it so hard for someone to sew up more than one dress 
for the hostess to wear? she always wears the same dress 
Not very Respectful to her..my sister will sew her some more dresses
Did they have Yule Logs in Victorian Times? Would love to see her create one!
She had a wooden spoon, didn't think of mixing with it. Didn't she . Yuck.
I thought brown sugar was used for Christmas pudding, was that available in the Victorian era?
What is suet???
I love these videos!!!
Yay! Another video featuring Mrs Crocombe. Thanks for this video. This plum pudding looks easy to make. Look at the fire dancing within its curved crevices; using that mould is really creative!
I really love all the recipes...and i want to try this one...but i'm from México and i cannot find suet  :( ...  Does anybody knows ir i can use anything else instead of it? Butter could work?
Where is Edgar lol
As somebody who lives in a country that doesn't sell suet, I can only watch this video and imagine I was eating some nice Christmas Pudding 😭
what is suet ?
Can I use a non-alcoholic drink like orange juice instead of Brandy ? 
Thank you very much.
Can I make this without the sugar?thinking the sugar on the raisins might suffice for the sweetness   I'm trying to go sugar free this Christmas  😬
Can't accept that suet....yuk.  is there something else you can use instead.  Also does suet add a particular flavour?
Such wholesome videos. So delightful to watch.
So plum pudding has no plums? Ahhh the English and their naming lol
as an American,  a black one at that,  this channel fascinates me. love it.
Hang on, what happened to the breadcrumbs?? I didnt see her put it in
Does it really takes six hours to prepare?
What is suet, anyway? Forgive me, I’m American
Taste so much the egg?
so did the wealthy homes not put coins in the pudding?
What actually is suet?...
What exactly does the suet do for this dish??  Is it like a butter substitute??  Please forgive my American brain.  It hasnt been taught all the smart things lol.
What is suet? Is it some sort of animal product?
Nice video!!!
Suet is beef fat
Does anyone want sweet sauce with their pudding , or is it just me ?
I wonder if you can get dried currants in the states?? I've only ever seen it in jam form, since they are illegal in most states. I guess you can sub those for cranberries or dried cherries?
Superb!
What about the breadcrumbs???? Where did they go???
What are suets?
DAMN at the end how did she light with a match and light the pudding can u tell me.. i have never seen anything like that..
For the truth's sake, guys, let's get serious. Is this woman delightfully HOT? Yes, she is.
Lovely
Where are the plums??
Why when we are being shown the Victorian method are the ingredients given in metric weights?
Called plum pudding.... no plums.
How long will it burn?
How do you put the fire out?
You spooned the Mix into the mold  yet she mixed it with her hands? She couldn't have been more sanitary and used the spoon to mix it?
Very nice indeed
I just can't figure out what is suet and currants...
So nice.
What is suet
I guess she was born at a different Era. Cool vids.
Is the butler in any videos?
Can anyone explain to me what is suet?
Does anyone know why it's called plum pudding when it doesn't have any plums in it. I have always wounded this even though I have eaten it all my life. My grandmother's is the best lol.
I’d love to know what suet is? I suppose I could look it up, eh?
I'm a little lost here, isn't that a panetone? Does anyone know the difference?
Whats suet?
What is suet?
I am in Haven.
Thank you so much for the posting. Please could you make some figgy pudding. My gran always spoke of her mum making it for Christmas.
I'd like to chase her around the kitchen.
Can someone PLEASE tell me what suet is?
What is brandy? Is it alcoholic?
What is suet????????
Where is her accent from? I mean, exactly? I study English, and that is not the normal stereotypical British accent, so just curious.
hi, American here, what can you use as a replacement for suet? we don’t use suet and lard here.
What is in mixed spice?
My granny used to make Christmas Pudding every year to bring to Christmas dinner. She was, of course, English  I don't remember having.any though, maybe because of the brandy poured over it. I was just a youngster. It sounds yummy.
Well, this is not pudding but ordinary cake... there is not pudding at all
Cualquiera que se pregunte que es suet es manteca vegetal
No plums nor pudding in this. I'm confused lol
Why was it called Plum pudding when there’s no plums in it?
Why when she mentioned the ingridients, she changed from british into american accent? Is the chef really a british or its just an act?
Wonderful looking pudding, but I cannot get suet where I am. Is there something that can be used as a substitute? Would butter work?
What is suet?
Wow she’s back!!!!
I enjoy the videos, but what the heck, steamed for 4 hours? Why not just bake it? LOL that mold is looking rough as well, I bet that cake has a metallic taste after being steamed in that for hours on end, LOL
Never mind a pinch get stuck in there with cinnamon, nutmeg and cherries...Don't like peel.
How did I get here
a
It's really not all that good to eat. We prefer another old fashioned pudding at Christmas "Carrot Pudding". Cooked the same way and same flaming presentation and much more deliscious. Also, grated on a box grater, frozen butter is a perfect sub for suet as it's hard to find and most Americans find the idea of eating beef fat in a cake disgusting.
So yummy!
Typo
What is the name of the English Christmas treat that is made months ahead of time and periodically added rum or brandy to? An English neighbor used to make it and boy was it good. It had all kinds of fruit in it and tasted of that and brandy. I would love to know how to make that. Does anyone know?
white rum sauce with the christmas cake!!!!
That Puddin is LIT! 🔥🍮🔥
Am I the only one who gets concerned at putting toxic berries atop a pudding? One holly berry is enough to put a grown person on the e.r. and yet I know a lot of folks who are just careful not to get them actually in their mouths if they use them as a garnish. I would be afraid I would accidentally lose one into the dish and eat it. Still, it's a tradition that has a very long standing and I am glad that they used it in the video.
What is suet? The german translation says „Talg“ - that‘s a little disgusting ... ?!
Sorry but I think the people in England eat some nasty tasting food like plum pudding and things like blood sausage. Don't hate me.To each their own likes. Glad you all enjoy it. Happy Holidays.
Is this ok for children?
I tried this like over 10 times and it’s very soggy because the water can’t evaporate it just soaks into the cake
Why is it called a plum pudding if there is no plum in it at all? Also, what would I use in place of suet?
What is brandy?
There are no plums in this recipe.  Anyone know why its still called plum pudding?
I always how the leftist hasn't closed down this channel/company yet!
Did this episode not sit right with anyone else? Like something ain’t right.
why is it called plum pudding if it doesn't contain any plums? lol
what is candied peel and can u buy it in a store
What's suet?
Could you have been any slower giving the ingredients? sheez.  And why would it be called plum pudding when there are no plums?  With the ing's, it seems very similar to fruitcake.
Gross
Can butter or lard be substituted for suet? Mostly curious about butter though, they sell lard by the small buckets here and I'm afraid I have no expertise in using it up haha
Though being Polish I'm on a mission to prove that English food IS DELICIOUS :) I make pudding for Christmas Eve supper , probably the most important meal of the year in Polish tradition.  Result: now my family can't imagine their Christmas without it ! I use a different recipe as suet's not my thing but it never fails me. Bon apetit & cheers from Poland !!!
I have to ask.  What is suet?
I’m confused, so what do you English people call puddle that’s actually pudding? (Like American pudding). Is it still pudding or something else?
I'll never understand how the English can eat that thing. I tried to eat it more than once and it's just awful. I even tried making it without the candied peel (which I despise in general) but even then it was just a moist dough with raisins. I think I'll stick to pumpkin tart for Christmas. Simple, easy and far, far, FAAAAAAR more delicious.
"...It's perfect for those occasions when you were told there were 10 for dinner but there are, in fact, 14" SPILL THAT TEA MRS. CROCOMBE YOU ABSOLUTE BADDIE
Mrs Crocombe's gâteau de pommes brings all the boys to the yard
Mrs. Crocombe does not approve of unannounced dinner guests. Considering how labor intensive cooking was at the time, however, I really can't blame her.
Mrs.Crocombe... snatching her waist and our wigs since 1880
Sooo...which of the kitchen maids is Edgar secretly in love with? There must be one, strapping young man that he is 😉
Come on, give us some gossip!
Do NOT overbook Mrs. Crocombe's dinner parties! She'll give you angry eyes that cut through to your soul.
The way she says “armonds.”
3:30 This feels like personal. Like it’s happened to her and she’s still holding a grudge. XD
"when you're told there are 10 for dinner, but there are in fact 14." Preach sis! Preach. 🙄
I wouldn't mind these videos being longer... Just saying.
👨‍🌾 "Picked it myself Mrs. Crocombe! There won't be a bruise on them! Garden's finest! 😊"
👩‍🍳 "Hmmm good..."
Mrs. Crocombe so savage!! 🤣🤣🤣
Yes, looking forward to the vid and seeing Mrs. Crocombe make this yummy dessert.
Can't wait to see Mrs. Crocombe, but I'm wondering if Edgar will make a cameo appearance to witness the results of his picked apples? I am definitely looking forward to Edgar's next video soon too! <3
I anticipate this video! Kathy Hipperson who portrays Mrs. Avis Crocombe is absolutely brilliant as this historical cook. She gives me great joy.
English Heritage should publish "Mrs. Crocombe's Authentic Cookbook;" I would purchase a copy.
I've been waiting for this. Is the cute apple boy going to make a cameo?
why is it called Apple "CHEESE"?
Reminder to be careful not to splash yourself with boiling syrup! Melted sugar is the napalm of the cooking world.
Now we finally get to see those apples picked a few episodes back put to use!
Does anyone else feels a deja vu of shorts or is it just me ?
This is so calming for some reason like idk it’s so different from the fast life outside the screen ....it feels so nice to see something calm
I hate when someone tells you there's only 10 for dinner but there's actually 14
Lovely ! that's really funny because Gâteau de pommes in France is like an apple cake basically, and in english it's "apple cheese" meaning "fromage" in french like Cheddar, Stilton, Brie etc 😂 how languages can be fun ^^
How do you eat it? Do you just slice it like jello and serve, or do you slather  it on toast or a pastry of some sort?
Unpopular opinion I actually really like the idea of this because talking to other MS. C FANS IN REAL TIME is like good vibes.
She mentioned she has a cookbook anywhere we can buy it
Don't mess with the dinner headcount!  @3:30
If I had her accent, I would not shut up tbh. 😂
The boy in the beginning looked so confused 
EDIT: when ever I see comments like this I think people are being petty but I am genuinely grateful of me having more then 2 likes on this thank you 🙏🏻
Haven't seen this in a long time...my great grandmother use to make it in the 60s
Thanks for the memories ❤️
I skipped class to watch this. Anything for Mrs. Crocombe
I am no fan of this Premiere-setting for regular video uploads!  :-(
The regular YouTube-notification is all I need for videos.
It only makes sense to me to announce an upcomming live-stream a day or to before it happens! Or maybe for a very special video announcing exciting news - to give the followers a chance to get them all together, at the same time.
That's my oppinion after coming across this setting at some YouTube Channels I follow regularly.
Now I will try to curb my impatience until I can finally watch this video - which I'm shure will be as enjoyable as always! ♡  :-)
Notification squadddddd..will I make the dish this time???
Probably not again. 😂
Nevertheless still love the video
I love Mrs. Crocombe videos! The quality of the video is excellent, and the brithish accent is so comfortable and relaxing ❤️
Greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽
Omg this continuity...the Mrs. Crocombe fandom is THRIVING
"...It's perfect for those occasions when you were told there were 10 for dinner but there are, in fact, 14"
Mrs Crocombe Badass
More of Mrs Crocombe please!!!!
I like how she say almond 
ARRMOLDS
i dont like the waitingsetting, i would rather just see the video in a few days. this takes time and is anoying to me
Hi,i from chile.
I liked so much you channel.
I love the victorian way.
Los adoro! Admiro mucho su trabajo y pais!.
❤
Ah, Edgar...one last shy look to Mary-Anne and off the lad goes...
I ship!
Wonderful video as always ! I really look forward to the next one :)
(And something that made me laugh is that at 0:26 the gardener looks like the confused Nick Young meme)
"For this recipe, you will need...."
I don't know why this part is so satisfying to watch... :D
I couldn't help but think of daleks when I saw the finished product :p


Anyways, always happy to see your video's Mrs Crocombe.
Love all of Mrs Crocombe's videos but please can you make a proper recipe one of her Christmas pudding? Pretty please???
We hope everyone's looking forward to the new video. We are trying this video as a Premiere, offering our subscribers advance notice so that you can tune in to watch with other viewers and chat in real-time. You can also hit the 'Set reminder' button to get a notification when the time comes.
Idk why but these videos just help me calm down. Like these videos are the ultimate de-stressor for me🤷‍♀️
Long time no seeee😍
Happen to stumble here. And thinking she's just making jam.

Also me after watching some other vids and back here:
Yash something easy for i am poor and lazy to do all what she can
Why to use same size apple when you are going to pulp them anyway?????????
Can we have a cook book from Mrs. Crocombe?
I have never made anything in any of these videos, but I have watched every single one instead of studying for things.
I love thinking that boy was like, MY TIME HAS COME! When they told him “just be weird & nervous”
This seriously needs to become a TV series!
Come on Netflix, where you at!!!!!
wait a moment....

"Gonna?!"

I knew it!
you're a time travelling imposter!

WHERE'S the REAL Mrs. Crocombe?!
That look upon announcing unannounced guests - priceless. XD
2:26 

Crocombe: “They’ll be perfect for my Gateau De Pomme”

Guy: 
>told 10 for dinner
>actually 14
>fallofrome.jpg
"Gateau de Pommes, or apple cheese"
Doesnt gateau mean cake in french?
That wasn't I expected... It's just apple jam and some almonds... 🤔
Omg please release a cookery book. It could be $10000 and I'd still buy it
Love Mrs Crocombe as always! But I also love Edgar. He is so adorable!!
Them: So... apple butter with some almonds?

Mrs. Crocombe, an intellectual: Gâteau de Pommes
gateau means cake in french, not cheese
Why Mrs. Crocombe wearing same dress again and again?
- Gâteau AUX pommes!
After the video
- Ooh... Ok!
How would this be eaten? Like jam perhaps? Also, more Egar please!
Savage Moment... "When you were told there were 10 for dinner but there are, in fact, 14.*side glanced then make face*" 😂😂😂😂
Oooh yummy! I've been looking forward to this since Edgar's video. ❤
I think we have some dessert/snack like that in Indonesia. It called 'dodol' or some place called it 'Jenang'. It has the same ingredients and technic
damnit I love this lady, the accent, the cooking skill, also the castle, the garden boi, so perfectly fit  in such one short video, how magic is that!!!(I'm so straight XD)
I simply cannot get enough of this show!! Only wish episodes were longer they’re so good❤️
Hell yes!!! I just got hungry by seeing this lol XDXDXDXDXDXD
No need to schedule it like this. In fact I prefer the pleasant surprise of seeing Mrs. C. on my feed!
I love everything that's going on in every video! So satisfying!
That garden boy Edgar is so damn handsome! I'd like to gaze into his blue eyes for ever...
I think I speak for everyone when I say WE NEED MORE EDGAR
But seriously I really enjoyed his gardening advice and am looking forward to another video from him
C'mon publish the cook book of this amazing woman!
Well that was quite easy recipe to try here in India Mrs.Crocombe. Here in India I suggest to use high quality Kashmiri apples. Quite easy to make and  sophisticated in look.  That is certainly an addition to my cooking quest. Thank you.
amazing. as per usual. but why would you translate "gateau de pommes" to "apple cheese" and not "apple cake" ?
doesnt Gâteau mean cake? I think she mistranslated that at the end, apple cheese would be fromage de pomme
.
...Apple cheese? But...Gâteau means pie or cake...

Maybe this is some of this british humor at play.
I just LOVE This series. Thank you for keeping it going!
I love the quality of your videos! So glad I subscribed, I look forward to every new video!😄👍
That intro was so cute!
I'm also wondering, could I use a jar of applesauce to make this to skip a step?
I hope Mrs. Crocombe doesn't see this. I'm sure she wouldn't approve.
A R M O N D S
Yassss. My fave lady is back.... With another gross recipe... But looooveeee your sass!!!! Yassss queeen
J'adore l'accent tellement british du "Gâteau de Pomme" x)
So confused since gâteau de pomme means apple cake.

P.S. the flower she used is catnip!
Yassss!!! She can boil water "The Victorian Way" and I'd still watch it!
Isn’t Gateau de Pommes Apple Cake?? Wouldn’t Pommes de Fromage be Apple Cheese
amazing video as always. i always look forward to these. but i agree with everyone else, that 'premiere' feature is just irritating. no worries though, still love this channel just as much.
This series is so, so brilliant! Absolutely love it. You were my inspirstion and I hope one day I will be as good as you are 😍😍
I love watching your marvellous videos. Thank you ♥️♥️
I have just discovered this channel and love it but what is the time frame? Mrs. C.’s dress looks 1860’s to me.

I’d spell her whole name but I forgot it. 😶 My bad.
That's an oddly froggy name for an English dessert.

There is shinanigans about
Why, Mrs. Crocombe, you dare entice us with a teaser of your gâteau de pommes?

I do not like them apples, madam! ;)
Was this really filmed back in the Victorian era????
Gâteau = cake
Fromage =  cheese
And yet Gâteau de pommes translates to apple cheese?
Fantastic! Thank-you, I look forward to your notifications.
Yaaaas!! I was looking forward to this after seeing the apple harvest!!! <3 This is awesome!!! <3
Yay...🤗🤗
My girl serving up victorian realness...yes queen yesss!
I love Edgar mouthing "gataeu de pomme..?" To himself in confusion
Yet another treasure of a video bestowed by E.H. onto us.. thank you I'm delighted! Edgar is such a loveable guy, and Avis is the best thing ever as usual..  your casting dept  deserves a raise for finding all these exquisite actors!!
I admire the actress that plays Mrs Crocombe.
She takes a lit of initiative to demo. the recipes as they were in actual times.
Thank you.
Watching these videos encourages me to do things properly.
I clicked on this video to hear the pure British accent
I love the acting with that apple-picker when he mouths the words, "Gateau de Pommes" in confusion. XD
0:26 Edgar’s face😂😂
 
Mrs. Crocombe: I’ll be making gateau de pommes
Edgar: ...
Edgar’s mind: 
Yasssss new video from Mrs.Crocombe!!!........ Wait what?!?
I would have run for my life from that look xD
I really don’t like the preview feature, but love the ultimate Boss Mrs Crocombe for life 😍
I love these recipe videos so much! But I’m also so curious about other aspects of Victorian life! It would be amazing if you could do more videos on that as well 💕
Is it Mrs Crocombe, her skills, or her clothes that are so sexy? I honestly can't tell. 
Would marry.
Holaaaa ame el canal, no entiendo nada de los procedimientos pero me encanta las técnicas y le tipo de platillos que recrean ojala y pudieran subtitular sus videos, me encantaría intentar hacer alguna de las recetas en mi cocina, saludos x3
This seems to be a slightly stiffer version of applesauce?
So... super sweet applesauce with decorations. What am I missing?
" gâteau AUX Pommes" de rien ;)
Me: YAY!……oh.
I’m curious as to which course this would be served and how it is eaten. 

Ms B.
Ohthankgod its apples. I thought it was gonna be chicken stock...
... I dont know french...
A atriz que faz a Senhora Crocombe, é bonita em!  #BR
These videos are so relaxing.. I am in the middle of my exam preparation...I watch these when I am taking a break from my studies...
i love these vids, they are so calming. and the comment section is always so wholesome
yesssss new video just looking forward to it see you mrs crocombe
IM SOBBIGN THAKN YOU YAY i’ve missed her
What are you doing!?  Stop looking at the comments and enjoy Mrs. Crocombe's videos! <3
Where do you get those lovely ceramic mixing bowls Mrs Crocombe uses? I would love to get a set. @English Heritage
Felt too quick but loved mrs crocombe none the less can’t wait for more!!
Pls make some Indian dish MS crocombe 

Love from India ❤️❤️❤️
Would like to see a decorative food item called an "Ice" made.  It's ice cream placed in molds of various shapes. I'm curious how they got these cold enough to hold these shapes while on the table.
Always excited to see Mrs. Crocombe and her recipes. I just made roly poly the other day and it was divine!
Mrs. Crocombe seems very stuck up... i still love the character :) she is amazing
I’m patiently waiting for holiday recipes!!!! 😋😋❤️❤️🎄🍗
Cher Horowitz should have gotten Mrs. Crocombe to cater that party with all of those people that like, totally did not RSVP
I love the way mrs. Crocombe says almonds (armonds)
On dit gâteau AUX pommes 😅
The recipe calls for lemon zest but she used lemon rind instead.
I am always looking forward to Mrs. Crocombe videos! ^_^ This looks delicious!
I just love all your videos. You bring those characters alive to perfection.
I dislike the premiere settings and won't use it!!!!!, but I will watch the video..just my opinion
UGH! 👏🏻 DO YOU REALISE 👏🏻 HOW ADDICTED WE 👏🏻 ARE TO MRS. CROC’s VIDEOS?! 👏🏻 please make a hundred more!
Gâteau de pommes OR apple cheese

Something doesn't sound so relevant to me 😂
Thank you so much English Heritage and Mrs. Crocombe for filling my day with pure and unexplainable happiness! I actually tried the recipe but without the lemon as the apples I bought are somewhat tart. Perfect to serve when chilled! More power to you guys!!!
She said good day to you like RuPaul says sashay away. Shes my hero.
"And you certainly don't want to use anything that's bred specially for cooking." - isn't that exactly what a nonsuch apple is?
If it's Apple Cheese, then why not call it "fromage aux pommes"?
Im gonna attempt this but ill make it more modern looking OwO
I like the ambiance. So medieval
Sooo, applesauce with custard?
I missed you so much, Mrs Crocombe! :3
I've been looking forward to seeing what delicious dish you made with the apples Edgar brought you!
Yess yesss excellent welcome back Mrs. Crocombe we missed you
Mrs. Crocombe & that snatched waist!!! Yas queen!!! We stan!!! #SkinnyLegend
Premiering 5 days in advance? :(
I always look forward to these videos! <3 I cant wait for the next one! These desserts are so yummy looking
Yeah... Your team is required to continue producing this series for as long as the internet lives. Thanks! :)
Our THICC QUEEN is back!
I love this series!!! I would love to see other videos from other house staff. Like the maids ect.
It looks like another porcupine 😁 Lovely show. I never miss it.
4:05 The "receipt" says sliced "armonds"?
'Gâteau de Pomme' sounds amazing if said by British _
I like Edgar.  I think Mrs. Crobombe does too.
thank you for coming back Mrs. Crocombe :)
Gosh, this is the most wholesome community I've EVER seen!!! Thank you Mrs. Crocomne for bringing us together. ^_^

Also, I LOVE the lad's face when she says "Gâteau de  Pommes", he's like "Gate-ga-what?", and then his reaction when she says she needs all the apples the same size and he's like "Oh no... not again..." XD
I thought “gâteau” was the French word for cake?
10-14? Idk about you, but I could probably eat that whole thing.
THANKGOODNESS YOUR BACK! JUST IN TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS!
World's first Gordan Ramsay....the savagery.....😯😳
For those who desire an unsettling dessert reminiscent of hyperdontia.
The boy wanted to pick mrs Crocombes apple too
Perfection!! 👏👏
It looks bad...like a rotten jelly monster, anyway very interesting!
And what is that white liquid that is throwing around? at 4:43
I scramble to watch every time you guys post this series <3
i love this channel =] are her recipes published?
when you are boiling the apple, can you homogenize them first? guess this will save you some time
Crocombe is very intimidating, maybe that's the point? xD
I tried tomato aspic once.  Yes, best tomato soup I've ever tried.
Ah, of course.  The pectin from the rind would act as a gelling agents. So clever!
Well.... ''' Gâteau de Pommes '' is incorrect. It is '' Gâteau aux pommes '' and I'm a native french speaker.
It looks like what we call Apple Butter. Ours is jarred like jam instead of molded though.
Oh wow I want some of that! That's a new recipe to me, never seen one like it. Will have to attempt to make it at some point
You guys should release and ''Mrs. Crocombe recipes cookbook''
Welcome back Mrs. Crocombe!   Glad to see your Geteau de Pomme.  More please and I still want to see the Glass Houses.
Love her. I would totally do a marathon if she had a cooking show. :) She's such a delight.
These vids are so cute❤❤❤
Can I just say I really enjoy watching these videos but, I find her a real turn off. Her speech is that of strictness and harshness. She lacks warmth.  She's the kind of person I would hate to work with  or be stuck in an elevator with.  There's also a slight uppitiness about her
First vid I watched, loved, subbed and am ready to convert the  measurements and for me that means math, I dislike math( not a huge fan of spelling either)
love the continuity. would love to see more of Edgar, the other gardeners and other servants’ day-to-day.
I thought that was Gordon Ramsey paying her a visit🤣
I don't suppose there is an actual cookbook for "The Victorian Way" that I could buy? That would be wonderful! :)
He should have come back with oranges just to screw with her 😂
If Mrs Crocombe releases a cook book, I will be the first one to buy it .. 👍🏻😉👍🏻🎂🍰👌🏻
"Who are you talking to, Mrs. Crocombe?"
Замороженное повидло, вот это даааа...вот это эксклюзив...😹
Imagine Gordon Ramsay cooking for Mrs. Crocombe.
Miss Crocombe being bossy is the best thing. That and the way she "lands" those armonds on the Gateau is just divine
I love the look she gives when she says "when you're told there are 10 for dinner, but there are in fact 14."
I kept thinking she said "ghetto"
So excited have been looking forward to this video since I first saw the add. Love Mrs. Crocombe & 💜💜💜 Kathy Hipperson. She really embraces the role she’s perfect. I wish “Mrs. Crocombe would get her own cooking show on tv. 🇦🇺
Hi Mrs. Crocombe! lovin' the accent ☺
I myself live in Russia, but I adore watching these videos, I love your language, it’s pronunciation. I hope that one day I will come to UK to see all this beauty by myself.
Have a good day whoever is reading this ✌️
It's so pleasing watching her cook❤ Makes me smile😊
I'VE MISSED YOU MRS CROCOMBE <3
I wonder if we'll ever get a cameo from Lord and Lady Braybrooke?
This video is such a good stress reliever<3
could we see a 'short-bread cookie' recipe?
I would love to see even more characters show up, explain their jobs and interact with each other. It's like living history. TBH I would love if we could have most history done the way these videos are. Imagine cleopatra or ghengis khan talking to you about their daily lives. Even better, imagine their servants talking about it :)
Beautiful as always! Thank you!
Now I know, before he became famous, Sir Edward Edgar also worked as a gardener.
Tfw the master had told you there were 10 for dinner but there were in fact fourteen
That face the servant boy made when Mrs Crocombe said Gateau de Pommes
Estaría buenísimo si pudieran agregar subtítulos en español. Me encantan estos videos! 💚
Thank you for making these. I love them! I promise I'll visit Audley End House when I can hopefully one day afford a vacation.
Love these vids. Thanks so much. I am huge British history buff as well as a baker.
I can't wait for Christmas recipes with Mrs Crocombe!!!!
Worth the wait! Beautifully filmed and presented. I love spending a little time in kitchen of old with Mrs. Crocombe.
Yes! A new Mrs. Crocombe video!
Eep this is exciting! I hope Edgar joins us. I know we've all been waiting for this recipe since the apple picking video.
How brisk our Mrs Crocombe is with the poor third gardener...
mrs crocombe throwing shade at her employers YAAAAS
Mmmmm, i love anything to do with apples...i bet this tastes just gorgeous! I missed the Premiere...i don't mind either way how i watch these videos...if i'm free then i'll watch the Premiere but if not the video will always be available an hour later.
An episode with Audley End lore, additional characters, tasty apples And Crocombe sass? This recipe really has everything.
This looks really really good! I will give this a try this christmas. Thank you so much! Hugs from Norway.
Wie geil ist das?! Daumen hoch 👍👍👍
Loved the tension in the opening regarding the need for similarly sized apples. Riveting.
But why didn't they have Mrs. Crocombe (Kathy Hipperson) read the list of ingredients herself, as usual?
Y'aaaalll i love her videos so much! <3
I don't get the cheese part.  It's like solid, or very firm jellied  apple sauce
HER FACE AT 3:38 IM SKSKKSKSKS

wig s n a t c h e d
In the beginning, Edgar is like "bench whut?" but goes "Of course, Mrs. Crocombe" cause he a good boy like that 😂
I missed you Mrs.Crocombe
Sincerly, one of your biggest fan
Oh wow!! The follow-up episode
Yaaay new video! More cooking content pleasee❤️❤️
Did you actually fire up that big coal range cooker or has it been converted to natural gas or electricity?
For the American conversion, the recipe is 2 1/2 cups sugar, 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons water, about 10 small apples or 8 medium apples or 6 large apples. Thanks for sharing!:)_
Am I the only one who didn't realise Pommes was French for apples and not chips

I also read chateau and thought that the staff would start making a chips castle
It’d be great to have a physical cookbook of Mrs Crocombe’s recipes!
She didn’t say thank you for the apples 😔 it would have been polite even though he wasn’t an equal in the servant hierarchy..
Oh, I loved the little skit at the beginning! Adorable!
Sis out here being iconic since the 1800s
OMG A VEGAN RECIPE (I can make vegan custard, or do without)! Hurray!!!!! I am going to make this as soon as I can!
Edgar: using the most beautiful words towards Mrs Crocombe
Mrs Crocombe: good
I love that Miss Crocombe's segment is turning into Downton Abbey. 😍😍🤗
It would .be a good idea To publish a cookbook with Her recipies
I thought Gâteau means 'cake' in french, but I wonder why she is not calling it a cake.
Ahhhhh, you tricked me Queen
I love it.  You are marvelous madam 🌻🌼🌸💜😘
Thank you so much for the video, I always really really enjoyed them. I’m not much of a cook but I am actually very into classical/ vintage clothing so I do sometimes dressed the part
Ahhh our boy~ also lmao I was waiting for this episode lolol
Edgar was such a sweetie!! I hope he makes a cameo!!
Oh shucks, I'm so sad it isn't on tonight 😢
I want her videos be 10 mins long
Your videos give me joy. And I love Mrs Crocombe's stern attitude. She seems like exactly the kind of strict, honest woman who would have run a stately home efficiently and with an iron rod. I bet all the other staff feared her wrath but loved her at the same time.
I love how after she says it's for her gataûx du pommes the boy who picked the apples mouthes in in confusion bless him xxx
DANG, how did i miss this! Well worth the wait x
How dare
😭
don't you just hate when you're expecting 10 dinner guests, but there are, in fact, 14.
I am so going to try this!
Can we see a Lord and Lady Braybrook mukbang, please?
Why does her accent keep changing? XD
Kinda driving me nuts that I keep coming back for this video and it’s not ready yet!
My friends: measure food in cups

Me...an intellectual: measures food in teacups
3:20 Mrs.Crocombe stays flexin on us
Jonathan apples would be ideal for this.  It's an American variety.
This is called "SEB KA mURRBBA" my dear 
Originated form sub-continent and presented in a gulabi Victorian way. ..... 😀😀😀
Seriously, folks, she never said that "gateau de pommes" translated to apple cheese. She said that was the NAME OF THE DISH, NOT A TRANSLATION. She never said it was a translation. My gosh! It's called an Apple Cheese because it is put into a mold like a cheese. the etymological origins of both "cheese" and "fromage" lie in the Latin term "caseus formaticus" (literally "fermented moulded"). Latin itself ended up using either word interchangeably for cheese, so there are texts where cheese is referred to as "caseus" and others where it's referred to as "formaticus" — much like how other such oddities exist, like "pommes frites" which omits the "de terre" of pommes de terre," and which would literally translate into "fried apples."
These videos are better than any tv soap drama series. Love the "hidden" humour in the beginning.
Love the guy's face when she says Gâteau de pommes
I am so pissed at myself. I saw this. Got excited. And immediately clicked.
Yesss the Audley End Universe
I'll more likely to forget about this... same with other subcribers. Set a reminder then forgot to watch it that day
lol woke up early for this! its 6:30 am for me but for Mrs. Crocombe its worth it! i love this series
The mix of syrup, apples, and zest by itself sounds like it would be incredible spread on toast or a muffin!
YESYESYES I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THISSS
❤️❤️❤️Gâteau Aux* pommes ! And Omelette Au* fromage !! Thanks you Mrs Croque en Bouche !!
Just what I needed to end the day satisfied and hungry😊😂
3:30
That's oddly specific.
Lol i was addicted to her voice ksksks😂
"Gâteau de pommes" literally means "Apple Cake" and definitely not apple cheese !
Aw what a let down. I was so excited. Definitely a trick and not a treat
I remember searching for this, I'm very pleased to see it finally being made from those apples that got picked.
Looking forward to your yuletide series Mrs. C!!! 🙌
I was totally expecting her to just dump those "armonds" on top of the dish, but no, they are strategically placed about the mold. Lovely!
Been waiting for this video
Was not disappointed
i don't know what it is but I cant steer away from these episodes. It makes me want to try the recipes myself.
Thats big all right. Thank you for sharing. Have a lovely day everyone
Her look at Edgar is exactly the look I give my dog when she has done something naughty 😂
3:31 Mrs. Crocombe out here serving the real tea
I’ve been waiting for this!
Later, tart Crocombe used her apple cheese in an erotic tryst with Apple Boy...
Every time I watch a video of yours I get mesmerized by the amount of work that is put into these videos ! Amazing
Tried this recipe, my mother always used to make it for Christmas! In france it is called "pate de pomme", which translates to apple dough... love this recipe! :)
YESSSS YESSSSSSW I LOVE IT ❤️❤️
So like apple jam but thicker! Looks incredible
Rahhhhh ! I was so happy to look at this ! That is a little disapointing, but i'll wait !
Downton Abbey staff didnt like the fancy food the upstairs residents ate. They prefered simpler food.
I'm a new subscriber. waiting for more new video
I honestly love the way these are set up these videos are so addicting I’m concerned for my sleep schedule
So delightful to watch Mrs.Crocombe series.
He is so cute the way he‘s intimidated by her. But such a fine, fine lad.
That little interaction in the beginning was priceless. Mrs.Crocumbe was one formidably intimidating women and surely had all the little garden boys on their toes with her high standards!
That's beautiful.
Damn Miss C, you lookin toned these days! haha :D
i would love to buy Mrs Crocombe recipe cookbook. is it avalible??
I remember the gardener was so nervous when seeing Mrs.Crocombe 😂😂
What a lovely gentle boy at the beginning.
😄
Did anyone else get a 50 shades of grey vibe between Mrs. Crocombe and Edgar who picked the 🍏 apples?
this will be on my birthday!!!!! my day will start on such a great note, I can't wait
This gateau looks delicious. Can't wait.
FINALLY!!!!
It’s never a dull day when there’s a new Mrs Crocombe recipe!
Edgar is so handsome. Lemme just make that Christmas gin punch (that's too strong for the scullery maid) and Edgar and me will be out in the orchards doing something that mrs Crocombe definitely would not approve of. 😂
Anybody up for a Mrs. Crocombe-Edgar-Lord Braybrooke love triangle?
sure I want Mrs Cromcombe and Marie Kondo do a "collab" yes please
Oh Mrs. C. I do believe that eager-to-please boy has a little crush on you. Be nice to him.
I'mm so happy to have found this youtube channel 👏👏
Yummy.... I am so glad I found this page. ;)
3:34 - 3:37 Lmao!! Mrs. Crocombe be throwing shade
Every time she pronounces gateau incorrectly my heart explodes
gosh i really do hope she make a movie..this cinematography is good.
When he was trying to pronounce gat- the dish I was like same.
Mrs Crocombe our new Queen <3
oh! Is it possible to get the opening music? I love it so much ˆ__ˆ
Mrs. Crocombe is a gay icon
I think it's safe to say that Edgar is the apple of many of our eyes 😸🍎🍏
I loved the video
Gatteau de pomme means apple cake or pie, not apple cheese tho
0:25
His face screams "what the heck is gateau de pommes?"
I love her Christmas cake it's a masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mrs. Crocombe throwing some shade
'the receipt says you should use sliced armonds'
Mrs. Crocombe was definitely bossy in bed. *wink * wink
I simply cannot get enough of Mrs. Crocombe. I just love these videos.
Mrs Crocombe mentions using paraffin to seal the apple cheese. I assume that it would be paraffin wax, and not the liquid paraffin? Would melting candles in a pot produce the same product, or is this poisonous? Many thanks for a really informative and interesting series.
Yasssss Mrs Crocombe is putting those apple bottoms to good use. Come thru my queeen!
So excited when I saw this !!!!
Woo hoo! I've been waiting for this to come out!
ARLMONDS!!!!!!!!
I can‘t tell how I love Kathy Hipperson as Mrs Crocombe. ❤️
"English heritage" cake's name is French
Ms. Crocomb needs to be nicer to Edgar. If she looked at me like that, I'd likely cry.
For those who don't know that mint is commonly known as cat mint.
So don't use it on your food if you have a cat.
How are here comments from 5 days ago if the video was 7 hours ago premiered
That Apple jam you lunatic ...
ur videos give me the feelings of 1940s
Yayyyyyy for Mrs Crocombe! Any news yet on an interview with the wonderful Kathy Hipperson? She’s building quite the fan base you know 😀
Oh how I wish Mrs Crocombe had a TV series.  I never tire of watching her!!
'Gâteau aux pommes' and not 'gâteau de pommes'. No worries, we love you British people. Especially for this kind of cute mistakes. From France, avec amour.
So, what I saw was apple sauce with almonds and butter coating on the outside.  Anyone see anything else?
At 4:06 did she say receipt instead of recipe? 😂
hell yeah
0:26 lol, the look on his face when she said Gateau de Pommes
Did she just say "armunds"?  I love her so much!
I love how Edgar mouthed Gateau de Pommes because he didn't know what it was - I would have been the same way XD
(When gâteau de pomme actually means cake of apples... not "Apple cheese"...)
"Alrmonds"
We stan an armond qween
In France this pompous stuff is a simple "compote" ... you can find it everywhere : in the school canteen, etc.
Mrs.Crocombe's cook book should be published. I would totally have bought it!
OMG I MISSED HER SO MUCH! 💖💓
Very nice really I was waiting to your video and I love your British accent .....
D'aw, poor Edgar looked so panicked in the beginning
Who needs ASMR when you can just watch Victorian baking? Relaxing AND has informational value 🍎🍎🍎
Oh no darling, I think you missed an ingredient out of that.. and a top tip here,, wear a wee hairnet, that's best to do when cooking anything with food.. 😉
What about the custard?  Did she use it? Thank you for another lovely recipe.
What do you do with it
Somebody's got a cruuuuush!
Edgar is just so cute...
Our queen of all cooks is back
Please keep making these!!! I love them!!!
It's so wonderful to see Mrs Crocombe again. Even if she's making is basically some sort of a formed apple sauce, it's still more than great fun each time to meet her.
But that’d how you make apple sauce. So its basically just pureed cooked apples shaped in a mold. Weird
The recipe that requires whole apples of the same size, what could that be?
Edgar is such a cutie! I'm hoping he'll appear in more videos. ^.^
And I HATE unannounced dinner guests! Like I need to know who's going to be sitting at the table ahead of time so I know how much food I need to make. And I imagine in the Victorian Era, it was more complicated to prepare extra meals than it is now.
legit wtf so dum,bandugly
It looks delicious ! and that is so weird because in french this is "compote" and in england that is a "gateau de pomme" which is totally different in France
So.... spill the tea on Edgar and Mary Ann. They obviously should be together.
Am I the only one who heard she said recipe as something else?  Like " recip " without the "e"
Omg loving this video !!!! You are awesome !
Damn Ms. Cocombre throwing the shade left right and center
i could see Mrs. Crocombe being a victorian styled dominatrix 😂 the whole glasses, corset, proper wording & posture the whole thing, don't get me wrong i love history, love these vids & she does a great job but i think about this & giggle everytime i see her lmfao
Excited 😊
"To be in the same size" ugh I love the way she said that
I love her sassy looks lol
There she is! I love Mrs Crocombe ❤️🙌🏻
My goodness, the smell of stewed or baked apples brings back so many happy memories for me...I bet the kitchen smelled divine once that dish was finished. :)
By the way. Gateau means Cake and not Cheese
So excited for some upcoming christmas-themed videos!
I do wish Mr. Edgar get to taste Mrs. Crocombe's marvelous Gateau De Pommes
It's not a gâteau and it's not cheese!  Confusing Victorians... ;-)
Mrs crocombe is amazing I’m absolutely intrigued with watching her !! I wish I lived back then and could try these delicious dishes lol
gateau is cake not cheese in french, did the meaning change as the recipe was adopted in England? but fun video as always!
I really love the look of Victorian dessert molds. This was a nice suprise to see when I opened the app.
The young man looked so scared of being beaten up with the apples he have harvested xD
For some weird reasons, she reminded me of Sheldon Cooper :D
Loved this!!!
Gateau de pommes sounds french 😁
Hi, great videos. On 2:40 After the apple is done you said "Rhine"? What is that? You didn't mentioned it on other section of the video, thanks Miss
She can be savage, love her
So basically halwa😂😂
Mrs. Crocombe is pretty banging. Plus she has a nice sass
Looks yummy, will try this,thanks for sharing.
Is there anyway I could get a Mrs Crocombes cookbook?
Mrs. Crocombe's dishes are very pretty, too pretty to eat.
"Gâteau aux pommes" and not "gâteau de pommes"...
the anticipation is killing me
This channel is very soothing and tranquil.
Mrs Crocombe can snatch my wig
Mrs. Crocombe probably smells like apple cheese
They're back! Yey!
Good morning Mrs. Crocombe, lovely to see you.
Do they really do this on regular basis? Or is it just for the show? 😅
She looks STRAIGHT OUTTA THE 1800s
Wait, this is my recipe for Apple sauce.
That last shot with the camera slowly moving counter the creams pour was as beautiful as the Apple cheese!
Watch and learn Mary-Anne he was a good boy
She sounds like Nigella Lawson!
She's such a delight to watch! 😍
0:26 His face! XD
First of all this feels so uncomfortable like a weird role play
How do u like them apples 😏😏
Ms Crocombe throwing shade around like a boss.
I didn't quite catch what the cultivar used is; can somebody else clarify that for me?
Mrs Crocombe does it again!!!
wonder why gateau de pomme was translated as apple cheese
Gateaux means cake in French not cheese, formage is cheese.
Isn’t gâteau French for cake???
Mrs. Crocombe's got a little hustle in the bustle.
Time to binge on Miss Crocombe vids again
Hello English Heritage im asking if where i the interview of the actress playing mrs c. that you promise to us months ago. Thank you and have a great day😀😀😀
Mrs.Crocombe is the wig snatcher of the 19th century.
That look says Mrs. Crocombe doesn't like surprise guests for supper.
Omgosh, that looks delicious!! 😲😄👌 Question, I'm so sorry but does anybody know what type of apple was used? I couldn't hear it (not fully deaf but also not the best hearing abilities and there's no subtitles to the video..
Mrs. Crocombe's sass is on a whole other level.
Please can she have her own series, a few minutes is not enough. Pleeeeeeeese 😘
0:27 gateau de what?
I thought gâteau meant cake? And fromage meant cheese 🤔 so wouldn’t it be fromage de pomme instead????
She spilling them hot earl grey tea sis
It's always a good day when Mrs. Crocombe makes an appearance.  I love the stink eye she gives poor Edgar - keeps him in his place! :-)
I don't know why but there's a sort of dignity about the British accent that is absent in USA accent. It's classy as hell!!
Martha Stewart's great aunt.
These videos are my favourite thing on YouTube at the moment, and I'd love a tv show about Mrs. Crocombe, omg! And the comment section on these videos is equally amazing! :D
Its interesting that its called Apple Cheese, seems more like an apple butter or jam to me lol
please make sunday roast next!!
I’d love to see Ms. Crocombe’s cookbook published some day.
In mexico we call it "Ate"
How delightful.  Looking forward to your Christmas shows.
To explain the power structure in that house, let's have a video in which Mrs. Crocombe is judged and abused by her superiors in the same manner she does those under her.
A fine day indeed when we are graced with a new video and mrs. crocombe.
Mrs. Crocombe seems very hard to please
Wow, that's a very sweet sticky formed apple sauce. I wonder if the custard is only very lightly sweet? Because otherwise it sounds eye stabbing sweet. Simple but impressive.
Miss Crocombe throwing some shade
Where have u been ? I missed you!. I love you
im so excited!!
Apple boy is lowkey cute?
2:10 she pronounced cooking very uncouthly
I'm French and i looooove when she says 'gâteau de pommes' so cute haha s
😍😍😍🤤
How man servings is that?
How would this be eaten?
Love Mrs Crocombe.  I can watch her videos all day long.  There was some kind of sauce she was pouring around this desert at the end of the video.  Does anyone know what kind of sauce that was.  Was that the "cheese" part?
That expression, where are the memes people?
its 3am why......
How can it solidy li'dat? No gelatin, and it is in marmalade/jam consistency form
I love how she says cooking!
Yasssssss
so it's apple sauce. . .the Victorian way
Gâteau means cake though, not cheese?
I can't wait to see Mrs. Crocombe!!!
.      yay..its Mrs. Crocombe     👍
Dang...all this time I thought her name was pronounced "Cro-crom-bee". I am a loser.
I loved that this tied up with an old episode of the gardener :)
0:26  ᵍᵃᵗᵉᵃᵘ ᵈᵉ ᵖᵒᵐᵐᵉˢ...??
I thought I was actually looking back at old videos about this😂
I simply love Mrs. Crocombe's actor, I feel she legitimately plays the part of a royal chef. She cracks me up with her mannerisms and way of being. I thoroughly enjoy this series <3
These videos are just sooo relaxing
This is amazing
Adorooo❤
I literally love these ❤️
I liveee for these 😁
“Arlmonds.” -Mrs. Crocombe
so ready for this😍
Such a beautiful video! I love to see how all ingredients are shown in slow motion . It is so incredibly simple and so elegant. I know it is testy as well .  I love hint of vanilla in my apple marmalade , and mint makes it more delicious .
Video is awesome .
Yayy!! It starting now!!
Cheese?!? 🍏👀🧀👀😯🤨🤨🤨
compote de pomme
i'm french so i want to ask why "apple cheese", gâteau mean cake.
this is my favorite anime
Cook book??
Yes a new video! It's gonna be a good day/week
Gâteau = Cake.  Fromage = cheese.
Yo when are we going to meet Lady Braybrook?
I love these videos but can we have the measurements in imperial too? I don't get metric (and before anyone says it, no I'm not American) and it was used at the time.
Hmm would Like to see how Mrs.Crocombe makes baked beans😍
.... Gateau is a cake not cheese
What's this about Mrs Crocombe's own recipe book? Is this a future endeavour that will hit the real life book stores?
"And for that one we need all the apples to be the same size..." *while looking in the general direction of his balls
Crocombe the realest and baddest biyatch
One simply does not not bring Mrs. Crocombe bruised apples! 🍎
1:29 sliced Aarlmonds
~♡~Is there a recipe  for the  cream sauce  that you poured around  it ? ~♡~
HALLELUJAH
Finally, the gateau we've all been waiting for! But wait, isn't this literally just apple jam made in a shape? That would be way too sweet to eat by itself, no?
You are so very lovely. I look up to you ma'am.
The beginning was the start of a good porn video
But... gâteau de pommes translation is apple cake not apple cheese, where did the cheese part came from? Or was it served with cheese on the side?
I never realised you could eat paraffin. Petrol pudding anyone?
Who would dislike this? Apple haters?.  I'm almost sure I saw the guy that plays Edgar before ... Maybe as an extra in a movie or a series? Anyone remembers?
Does this recipe require wearing a corset ?
Slurp! ... very good! ...delicious!
Can't wait!...  love watching these!...
This recipe is horrible btw. Texture of baby food
Mrs. Crocombe aint with the bs
I always wanted to be a monarch or maybe a noble
The way he mouths "gateau de pommes?" at the start like he's thinking "what is this aristo nonsense? What's wrong with calling it what it is, apple cheese?"
who said that women were useless in ancient times and gave nothing to humanity for god sake, they give the best thing  to the world FOOD
Mrs. Crocombe I hope you have made a cookbook. I would love to have a cookbook of all the food and drinks you make. I love watching your videos
They bought them apples at Kroger
HER FACE AT 3:37 IM DYINGGGGGG
gâteau de pommes n'est pas la même chose que le fromage de pommes... 🤔 🍎🍰🍎🧀
Always nostalgic
Umm... gâteau de pommes translates to apple cake, not apple cheese. And it makes more sense anyways😐
Back then things were so simple. A desert made from apples and ...thats all ...
So it's applesauce in a mold?
0:24 I love this section here because you can see the confusion on the boys face having no idea what ms. crocombe is even referring to, even mouthing it in confusion
Wish these were more often, love them.
Poor guy 😂 he is cute
That looks deliciously old fashioned. However we usually call It in french "gâteau aux pommes".
so did somebody have to hand slice those almonds!
So that’s how it’s pronounced
isnt gâteau french for cake? where did you get apple cheese from? cheese is formage?
0:26 That expression the boy makes when Mrs Crocombe said she wants to make Gateau de Pommes XD
Is this becoming a series again?
I would appreciate it, if you would tell us how they are usually served/eaten. I for myself have no clue as to what i could eat with it, or how i should serve it :P
So basically in English, it's Apple Cake
Yes!!!!!!!
Apple Dalek
Mrs. Crocombe is so sassy, I love it 😂
what a lovely recipe...
MRS CROCOMBE IS BACK
Did I hear correctly that the apples must NOT be cooking apples? Why not? And is there a way to tell if my apples are cooking apples or not?
In my country we do that dish but with quince instead of apples
Him mouthing, trying to say it is me in class.
can we replace the apples with any other fruits?
2:59 ASMR 😂
0:25 his face lol
Greating from Egypt .
Guy at the beginning was daddy
Looks lovely with the flowers!
YUMMY!!!
I LOVE THIS SERIES
oof i wonder where all that respect went cause we need sum
apple butter in Canada
THE SHADE! 3:31
Quite simple and few ingredients. Though I'm sure it is easy to mess up! Haha
apple cheese?? doesn't gateau mean cake???
I love all your videos because past seems beautiful no matter how hard it is
this is relaxing to watch
Gâteau means cake in French sis
YAAASSS QUEEENN YASSSS MRS. CROCOMBE SLAAAYYYYYYY YAAAASSSSS
The dude in the beginning looks like Tomska
#SaveYourInternet 
Because i never want to miss videos like this
❤️❤️❤️😍😍
She is the pretty sister of Nanny McPhee.
So she made a mold of applesauce?
I'm curious what about the preparation of this allows it to stay fresh for weeks or even a whole winter.
3:31 Shade comes from reading HENNYYYYY
0:27 lmao
😍😘😘😘😘😘😋
What always bothers me is the fact that gateau means cake, not cheese. So why in the world is it called apple cheese??
Emmy should make this! #emmymade
The bitchy side of Mrs. Crocombe 😅😅😅
Omg what a cutie
It's like a cake made of jam!! Is it served with bread as well? Because it looks like it would go really well with toast.
so  basically just apple jam in a mold? i'm not too sure about this...
UGH we stan a shady queen. Get it girl werkkkkk
She told the boy that, "all the apples must be the same size, because they go into the cake whole". Then, she peeled, cored, sliced and boiled into apple sauce.!?
Edgar is so cute!!
Lovely presentation
Mrs Crocombe is so authoritative yet polite that I am so scared to leave a bad comment on this video.
but gateau means cake and there is no cheese in that... I could not be any more confused.
Finallllyyyyy.
Cmnt#547
so good to see mrs crocombe again!!!
Yeeeeeeeeeeees she's baaaaaack
Omg can't wait!!!
It doesn't look too appetizing...
Gateau is actually cake in French so idk how she got cheese
I love these videos !
This looks delicious!!!!!!
The apple boy has such a sweet and innocent face.  He was like a small child when he brought the apples in to Mrs. Crocombe.
doesn't....doesn't gateau mean cake??? not cheese????
I love the bullet time effect at the end …😁
The name confuses me. Gâteau is a type of cake, and the recipe is what my grandmother used to make as apple butter. I don't understand the reference to cheese.
Yasss after a long day of school Uwuwuwuwuwuwu
Love these videos with Mrs Crocombe
How would you eat this?
he is so cute?
3:33 Looking at you Edgar
Why are all the French getting their knickers in a twist over the correct translation....if she wanna call it cheese she can even if its jam...
Weird the translation of "Gâteau de pomme" is 'Apple cheese' when it should translate as 'Apple cake' (even though it doesn't have the same meaning really)
No matter how crappy my day has been, these videos always cheer me up and calm me down. Please keep them coming and don't ever stop.
Ummm...I am French background....”gateau” is actually CAKE. made with sliced apples formed in layers. this is not apple cake. Apple cheese maybe?
Channel is called English Heritage. Shows us how to make a french cake.
I don't understand what this is and how you use it.
Im sitting here wondering; IS SHE REALLY BRITISH?!?! Lol
Yasss
this is my pride and joy
It's been a while. Gateau de whaa? Man's face.
Gâteau de pomme roughly translates to cake of apple
Gateau is French for cake, whereas cheese is called “fromage.” Is there a reason the two are switched?
Love Mrs Crocombe's videos!
Espera de 4 días para un un vídeo de 5 minutos y nisiquiera fue en vivo
It is interesting to me that the other apple dish she had made before was apple hedgehog, which was also decorated as same manner as this one. Poking with almond slices all around. She really likes her apples with almonds!
These videos are so mesmerizing
How do you serve it?
MEMBRILLO!)
Why are these videos so calming to watch???????
0:17 Mrs. Crocombe is not impressed
Looks very interesting and would make a good addition to short term food storage.
No need for uniform sized whole apples. Poor gardener.
I have such a silly question so forgive me....is this eaten as is, like a pudding? Or is it spread on something....? (The "cheese" part has me guessin', y'all!)
So, that's the old Victorian milliletre and gram, then!!
ARLMONDS
perfect for her ghetto de pammes
The Bots in PUBG mobile version......
Merci. Gigi
Mrs Crocombe doesn't seem to like Edgar too much. She was a bit rude with him. Hmmm.. And that recipe looks basically like Apple jelly with the bits still in. Like a pre-Jello pectin made jelly mold.
Edgar said that there is not a bruise on those apples, but I see a couple dark spots
0:27 that face when you make when a maths teacher says you won't actually need it in future , but you still learn it anyways.
Is it safe to eat the mint flowers?
She looks like Georgina Rodriguez
where did she get the plastic pan from
it's funny how in English you use the word "gâteau" for fancy dessert recipes when in french it just means "cake", and in French we use the english word "cake" for the kind of long rectangular shaped cakes. 
I mean just type "cake au fruit" , "cake au chocolat" or "cake au citron" and you'll see what i mean, there's something about the shape. Like we say gâteau for any other shapes but when it's a long gâteau we call it "cake".

Also in France when you say gâteau de pomme the first thing that comes to mind is a basic cake with pieces of apple in it. It's the first time i see a gâteau de pomme like yours, it's really interesting i wonder where it comes from
mrs crocombe can get it.
Awwwww, Edgar is so cute 😍
Love your videos
My Gateau de Pommes would never turn out this well.  As soon as I would attempt to flip the dessert out of the mold, the whole thing would probably come out in pieces.
This seems like such a paradise
lol... armonds.
Edgar looks like he crapped himself after she said goodbye.
That poor dude only wanted to do something right for once. She just shut that dream down
I love apples. And I need a cute little mould like that :)
Don't know if anyone has pointed this out already but gâteau de pommes literally translates the apple cake not apple cheese...
Mrs.Crocombe has some big ol boosums
i could listen to her speak for the rest of my life
It's gateau de Pommes?  Apple Cheese?   Isn't "Gateau" Cake?  I thought Fromage was Cheese.
Doesn't Gâteau de Pommes mean apple cake, I believe apple cheese would be Fromage de Pommes.
Apple cheese? 
Apple cake... 
😂
I love these videos so much !
These videos just make me so happy.
Wait I thought “Gâteau de pomme” literally translates to “Cake of apple” and that cheese is fromage?
I’m french and I love the way she say “Gateau de pommes” 😍
Love these videos
I got excited cuse I thought we were making apple cake
3:37
I'm confused. Doesn't "gateau" mean "cake"?
I love these videos so much
Sliced arlmonds
Why is it called apple “cheese” in English when the French name is more, well, accurate (since it looks more like a cake)?  It’s basically a moulded apple sauce...
31 bruised apples disliked the video
It seems to be a thickened applesauce "jello" dessert. I can remember my mother making homemade applesauce, it was not allowed to thicken like this. The applesauce was great for you if you were ill, as it was easy on a sore throat or delicate stomach. It was also an excellent topper for gingerbread.
i did not curse an appletree
Hear me out: Jenna Marbles loves weirdly relaxing youtube channels. We need to get Jenna to watch Mrs. Crocombe.
But gâteau means cake...
".. When you were told there was ten for dinner, but there are in fact, fourteen..." * flashes look * "Guuuuurrrrllll, you know what I'm say-INNNNN'!" * Head waggle - 3 snaps Zorro-style *
Love these videos!
I'm definitely on my own team here when I say this but why is Edgar getting screen time? Mrs. Crocombe can mention him from time to time, that works for me. I don't know why but I don't like the actor. XD
I made this for Thanksgiving and it was so popular my extended family claimed all the leftovers and left none for me
I think I missed the part with custard..
Am I the only one who is starting to look forward for Edgar's appearances? <3<3<3
Perfect.
LOL Poor Edgar
Gâteau actually means cake, not cheese
hd victorian camera
GATEAU MEANS CAKE!
Make Jugged Hare please Mrs. Crocombe.
American here. How do you serve this? Spread it on bread or scones? It looks more like a jelly than a cake? Nice video. Thank you for posting. 😊
i got excited when she said apple cheese!
Doesn't Gâteau de Pommes actually mean apple cake?
She needs makeup and highlights
lasts over the winter? that is impressive.
I’m so excited to see it. AHhhhhhhh
Townsend nibbas unite
Why on earth is it "apple cheese" in English?? "gateau de pomme" means "apple cake". Cheese = fromage.
The gardener is so hot 😍
Anyone have advice on more recipes posted that are old-fashioned like this and will keep for a few days like this one will? Thank you!
I am going to make this for Christmas!
Looks good! Can’t wait!
This looks really good
Edgar is daddy af
Who defuq dislike this video!!!! 😤😤
She's made molded thick applesauce
In the beginning, I really thought Mrs. Crocombe and Edgar were going to make love while she screams "Gateau de Pommes!! Gateau de Pommes!!" over and over.
No bruises but she picks up an apple with a weird spot on it.
Very satisfying
...did she say apple CHEESE??!!....
So stewed fruit then?
Doesn't Gâteau means cake?
im excited
Ar-monds
I loved homemade stewed apples. My grandmother use to make homemade apple sauce.
I'm assuming this is served like an apple dessert? Or is it like a spread?
La creme de la cremeeeee amo estos vídeos!!!
did she say ghetto department...
Pomme is apple in French
I am confused why it's called "apple cheese" when the translation from French to English is "apple cake"?
CIDER TIME!
Victorian food looks gnarly.
Doesn't gateau actually mean cake? Why does she keep saying chess? I really don't understand the connection that was made there
Nice recipe, only gâteau de pommes does not mean "apple cheese" but "apple cake." The French word for cheese would be "fromage."
Looks delicious! Isn't it Apple Cake, though? Otherwise, Fromage de Pomme? I apologize if I'm the 100th person to point this out; just curious!
gateau in Lebanese Arabic means cake.
Think he fancies her
In french "Gâteau" means cake and "Pommes" means apples... But she says "Apple CHEESE"... Shouldn't the title be "Fromage aux Pommes" if that were the case?
My grandpa used to make big kettles of this in the fall, we know it as Apple Butter. It is HEAVENLY on buttered cinnamon toast.
I can't wait to see the new video!
In the translator it says gateau de pomme mean apple cake not apple cheese
Man, I have some kind of instinctual fear of Mrs Crocombe. Like shes gonna scold me for bad table manners, neglecting my schoolwork, or wiping my hands on my breeches.
And how is this served up and eaten?
I always want these videos to be longer. I just love them and can’t get enough. I wish you had an entires Downtown Abbey cast of people describing Victorian ways of life. It’s all just so magical.
I wish my apples were as perky as hers 🌚
I felt physically pain coming off the kid in the beginning when he was trying to repeat the name of the dish
Mrs Crocombe mentioned the cookbook! When will we get a chance to buy it (if we ever will)? :D Maybe...before christmas? Would be the perfect gift! <3
If I were Mrs. Crocombe, I'd be paying less attention to the apples and more attention to the apple picker :)
Cool looking desert.
Apple cake not cheese
Apple sauce
3:36 the shade... Shade of it all
Would love to watch a television show with these great people.
I would LOVE to have a sort of advent calander of Christmas themed mini videos! Even a few Christmas ones!
The stores are already closed on my side of the pond, but I will give it a go tomorrow afternoon!
But.. gâteau means cake. Fromage is cheese.
Applesauce
But doesn't Gâteau mean cake? Correct me if I'm wrong. Fromage means cheese right? I'm drunk. RED WINE DRUNK >:D
isnt a gateau a french cake hmmmm?
Looks delicious 😋
I wonder what this other recipe is that requires whole apples
He's cute!!!
I am going out to buy apples.
Eeewwww
Fortunately the EU regulations forced the Victorians to make all apples the same size and as round and perfect as the one we saw in this video..  ;)
armonds !
how does one eat this dessert? As is, or biscuits/piece of bread?
Its basically Apple butter
This is NOT an apple cake, but it does look good.
Why is it called "apple cheese" in English? Doesn't gateau mean cake and fromage cheese?
but gateau means cake???
Ms Crocombe ive been very bad lately
Lol at how Edgar mouths gateau de pommes with a confused expression
Please please PLEASE, tell me they are going to make a cookbook!!!
Sliced arrrrmands lol
Can't wait
Yum yum yum
b-but... gateau means cake... so why do they translate it as apple cheese... is it just a cultural thing???
Since she cut them up in pieces, why did she tell the young guy the apples all needed to be the same size? Just being difficult?
Too much Britishness.
Is this person playing a character or is she like for real? I can’t tell? Reminds me of a SNL skit
Gateau means cake, not cheese...
she wife material... is she single?
Beautiful
Was the word 'receipt' used in the Victorian times instead of recipe? 4:05
Or is it just a difference in pronunciation?
I love this woman.
Gateau de pomme is apple cheese ? I must object to that translation. First a hedgehog and now this! Non mais!
The shaade
Gateau de pomme= apple cake fromage de pomme= apple 🧀 cheese
Id like to see how she puts the apples away for next year.
I wish I were living in those times...where the cooks used to take all the trouble to please the Lords and the Ladies....nowadays toh its us who try to please them so that they don't leave us and move to some other house...
In French she is saying cake of  cheese or apple cake nowhere did she say cheese smh I'm like gurl where you get the cheese from?😂
why does she need apples of the same size if she's just gonna boil them down to marmalade??
3:30 I laughed
Anyone else notice that gâteau means « cake » in French and not cheese?
Brava!
Best
a new video released on my birthday! thanks for the present English Heritage!
I'm confused by this recipe... How is this any different than jam?  What do you do with it?  Eat it with a spoon?  Serve it on toast?
Get ms Crocombe her own tv show now
How would you eat that, though? Is it a dessert? Just slice it up and dig in? I have no modern context for this one.
Looks like applesauce in the pot
doesnt gateau de pomme mean cake of apples??
isn’t gâteau de pomme apple cake?
And here i thought apple cheese was an authentic Lithuanian dish! However, we literally squeeze the cooked apple mouse like any real cheese and let it sit and dry for a few weeks. We also add hazelnuts, whole wheat, cloves or cinnamon. Apple cheese prepared in autumn is usually served as delicacy during Christmas or Easter.
Hi :) I learn English. Can anybody tell which English level was used in this video, mostly B1 or B2? Thank you
Where does the "cheese" part of the name come into play, by chance? Just seems like an apple jelly to me.
So it’s applesauce
Apple cheese?
Sugar, despite the fructose in the apples.
I feel very strange feelings watching mrs crocombe...Am I a sinner? Am I a dinner?
How is it eaten?
Delish 😋
Good God if only looks could kill.....the poor boy
Applesauce jelly
Why is this called Gâteau de Pommes  which means apple "cake" when it's neither a cake nor a cheese and more like an apple marmalade/jam/butter?
Looks so delicious 😋
Gâteau de pomme, or apple... cheese ?
French? Oh crikey, it's downhill from here....
3:34 to 3:38 : aunties sure know what they say and what they want XD
3:30 So sassy.
Ist das nicht einfach Apfelmuß in Form. btw a german command passed by.
I love these
Where's the closed caption????
yey youre back!
She's no Nigella Lawson.
That acting was so on point!
☺️☺️☺️
here i am about to grab a whomping handful and throw sliced almonds all over the Apple Cheese when Mrs. Crocombe begins to pick up one slice at a time, gently placing it, to form a pattern....I can feel her scorn from across cyberspace....sorry, Mrs. Crocombe, my bad
I love Mrs. Crocombe sooo much I want her to be my mom
LOML
I love it when missus Crocombe “spilled the tea”. Get it? Cuz she’s British and British people love tea....
Can this please be a tv show
this sort of just looks like applesauce and custard...delicious but.. what?
Uhmm.. where’s the cheese?
I wonder if they film this in the actual kitchen.
Can we straight up have a show with plotlines and niche recipes pls???
It’s more a gâteau de compote de pommes isn’t it?
I made a comment on a previous video asking if you ever make a copy of Mrs Crocombe`s cook book. I dont expext an answer but i just thought you should know that a lot of people would be interested in a legit 19 century cook book.
Old apple sauce?
They even makes the water look attractive!
There seem to be a lot of unlined copper pots in that kitchen. I hope they are never used to cook anything even mildly acidic. Tinned copper is OK, but make sure there is no lead in the tin alloy.
So, who is Mary Ann?
I'm so confused concerning baking paper, parchment paper, paper lining, wax paper... And how do you seal that with paraffin? Could someone explain please?
Is she an actress and are this episodes skits orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr reality? I need answers please so I can continue watching
too much sugar
Who eats this stuff when she's done making it? Other than Lord Brakenbury and the fam...
doesn't that translate into apple cake?
This recipe is something that I would make, but what bothered me was that gateau de pomme is “apple cheese” when gateau is “cake” while the French word for cheese is “fromage”. In my honesty, it should be “fromage de pomme” so it would be “apple cheese”
Why is this video 1 hour old yet has been on my feed for 4 days with comments from 4 days ago?
Yummy 😍my neighbor has a apple tree and he gives us buckets of apples I like cooking down the cored apples with the peel on in a little sugar water and when they are soft  almost like apple sauce serve them with vanilla ice cream the sweet/sour taste is so delicious and a fresh apple tastes very different than a store bought apple sauce 😊
Scrumptious!
So how do you eat it? What meal?
he looked at her like wtf did u just say?
How British!
Hoping there's almonds in the ingredients just so I can hear her say "Armonds".
Gâteau des pommes*
I'd love a demonstration of how to eat some of the things prepared, this being one. Do you slice it, dip it? Do you spread it on bread?
Where's the cheese?
What a joy it always is, to see a new video from Mrs Crocombe!  As always, I find it thrilling that the servants are now being given a voice.  I suppose the only way to cope with unexpected dinner guests was to always cook extra, though without refrigeration, leftovers would not have been feasible beyond the second day, at least in summer.  Agatha Christie's autobiography (indeed, her novels as well) are full of amazing information and insights into the lives of servants.  If you watch Downton Abbey or Upstairs Downstairs, you would think that servants where fairly well respected.  I suppose in one sense, they were.  But when you read source documents, particularly from the servants themselves, a different story emerges.  In many of Agatha's novels, the upper-crust characters would say: 'You don't look at servants.' and sometimes whole plots successfully revolved around that disregard.  For every Rosa Lewis (Lady Astor's maid) there must have been hundreds, if not thousands of badly treated drudges, totally thwarted, who would have been doctors, lawyers, stockbrokers, if they had been born one hundred years later.  The luck of the historical draw, I suppose.  Thank you again for another amazing video.
ms crocombe: oh bother, I simply despise the servants. I can no longer be concerned with their incompetence. grabs a large knife and walks out of frame
servants screaming "I am now going to end your life, the victorian way" * starts stabbing the servants with a calm and collected look on her face* 
 "sometoimes, the servants will scream and thrash about when attacked. vigorous force and a well sharpened knife will make quick work of them." the music™ plays as she finishes stabbing them. 
ms crocombe, surrounded by bodies: "I wonder what lord and lady braybrooke think of my decision to destroy the servants. I’m sure they will now realize I am all they need in audley end house..."
Nice dish. Liked the custard surrounding it.  I should think it would add that creamy richness to this dish
Hum where is the "gâteau"?  we can't call it Gâteau de Pommes
While she was inspecting his apples, he was inspecting her melons... and so was I.
Yum
Why is gâteau de pommes "apple cheese" and not apple cake?
4 unexpected dinner guests was a much bigger deal back then. I remember when my family would joke when my grandma stretched a meal from 4 to 8, equating the feat to the miracle of the loaves and fishes. For us, it was just an extra side dish or two made from pantry staples and frozen veggies. In Victorian times, it meant a lot of extra resources (and work from the kitchen staff)!
Apple boy is a mood
gâteau de pomme or fromage de pomme
HURRY, I'M STARVING!!
But gateaux means cake.
more Edgar please please please.
Wow!! Nice video! 😍😍😍
That gardener boy though...
So, is anyone else turned on?
Well that looks delicious
bitchy bitchy
Can anyone please tell me what "putting apples down for next year" means? Cheers!
lovely !
Way back then how is this eaten, what will it be served with an at what ocassion?
But how do you eat apple cheese.....I’m infatuated with Mrs. Crocombe and her cooking videos. That waist?!?! 👌
It's a pretends cheese, that's why it doesn't translated to cake
Did she really say that gâteau means cheese ?
pommes is apples i think and gateau is cake
YAAAAAYYYYYY FEW MINUETS LEFTTTTTTTT YIEEEEEE
Why was it important for the apples to be the same size? Seems to me as long as you cut them into equally small pieces it shouldn't matter at all
Gateau de pomme translates to cake of apple... where did the cheese part come from? Gateau de pommes is just flat out wrong. It would be gateau aux pommes, but that is a specific dessert not like this. We should probably stop carrying on continuations of language butchering.
Great recipe. Was this eaten as a marmalade on something or was this a standalone dessert?
Wonder why it's called apple cheese in English but french it is apple cake....
Does anyone know why it's called " Apple cheese" ? Because in french "Gâteau" mean cake and cheese mean "fromage"
She seems really...bitchy in this one.
That guy is so damn cute! If have an illicit, Victorian affair with him right there in the kitchen.
Great for the september month.
Why is this in my recommended
why did the apples have to be the same size then, if they're just gonna get sliced and reduced to jam?
Did they just eat slices of this?  Or did they put it on bread?
Apple gelo
Apple cake
British food! a pile of solidafied boogers on a plate
Lady, you’re a really scary character; and stop mentioning names we cannot relate, please!
gateau de pomme means apple cake...?
Hello! I live in South Carolina, USA, and I REALLY want to make this for Thanksgiving! Please tell me what kind of apple will work best in this dish. I understand not too sweet, not too sour... just wondering what type of apple you recommend. Thank you!!
Gâteau aux pommes, non ?
My grandmother used to make that for Christmas.
I'd like to know how you make your custard, Mrs. Crocombe. My New England ancestors made "boiled custard" or "custard sauce" which could be used with anything from fresh fruit to gingerbread cake, and sometimes just eaten by spoonfuls. It contained milk, sugar, vanilla, and egg yolks, and was cooked in a saucepan by someone who was good at stirring.
I just want to point out that "Gateau de Pommes" translates to "Apple Cake", (Not Apple Cheese)!
Doesn't gateau de pommes translate to apple cake? from the little french I know, cheese is fromage and gateau is cake.
Why does it look like a hedgehog?
But where’s the cheese?
How to make cake of apples
HERE IT ISSSSSS
Wer did u use the custard
I like matronly women.
So, she pours the custard around it.......how is this eaten?  Is it a dessert?
Gâteau de pomme is cake of apple not cheese. She said Apple cheese
How to make baby the Victorian way
Too short
How dose Gâteau de pomme witch means apple cake some how translate to Apple cheese??
Why are there always almonds?
so its apple jelly?
Just made this. Its wonderful, not just to look at, but to taste as well. I added a bit of gelatin to it because I was afraid it wasnt gelling enough but in hindsight that probably wasnt necessary because mine it ended up being even a little firmer than I intended (though i didnt find that to be a problem in any way). I decorated it with almonds (I feel mrs crocombe would not approve of anything less) and candied mint leaves and juliened lemon zest, both of which i made by brushing them lightly with egg white and then tossing with sugar, letting them air dry afterwards for several hours. They turned out delicious and nice and crunchy, not to mention a beautiful garnish. By far the hardest part was getting it out of the mold. i recommend a thin metal one rather than a ceramic one as shown in the video; easier to dunk in hot water to free the edges from the mold. Also required much wiggling and a little bit of manipulating with a finger to break the suction. If you dont have a vintage jelly mold, i suspect one could also put this in a simple saucepan, the result would be a far simpler shape but would, i suspect, have just the same impressive quality.
How would this dish be eaten? 'Apple cheese'leads me to believe it could be spread on crackers or bread. But gâteau du pommes makes me think of cake
It looks like an applesauce cake Jello 😮🍎🍏🎂🍮
I love that the classic English dish has a French name. And the Gâteau de Pomme means apple cake... not cheese
At last, I wanted a video with Mrs. Crocombe and you combined this video with Edgar ! Continue the great job, English Heritage !
Looks yummy
Cool
So it's an apple jam? But you call it cheese? But gateau means cake though. Lol
In slow motion food porn
That that's not what gateau de pomme means. Like am I the only one bothered by that. It's Apple cake not Apple cheese.
Do you have any advice on lining the mold? When I try to make jellies in a very similar stoneware mold they tend to stick and disintegrate!
Am I the only American who loves watching these videos?
Oh , my word Mrs.C is getting Feisty , poor lad looked diminished . Better not act too much . 
I would love to engage with this dish , but I like to see someone who is more kindly to their minions .
gâteau de pommes literally means apple cake  skskskxjxn
No Mrs. Crocombe, those apples' legs aren't even broken--why must we put them down? :(
The apple boy seemed super scared of her!
Googling has come up with apple cheese being something like apple jam or another sweet apple dish that is often eaten with crackers. So I guess this is a gateau de pommes made with or as an apple cheese.
What premiere setting is everyone talking about? I dont get it. The video is like usual to me
Am I the only one who finds her sexy?
I’m so attached to these people help.
I don't understand why gâteau de pommes is translate apple cheese I mean gâteau de pommes is apple cake in English
Gâteau de pomme means apple cake not apple cheese. Apple cheese would be fromage dès pomme.  Am I wrong?
I can't wait!!!!! Please, be hurry!!!!!
omg lol im dying sdghsdgfhsdfgfg
my Stupid self always thought there was an L in Armond... how embarrassing
Gâteau de Pommes translates to cake of apples not apple cheese.
I’m very confused... wouldn’t a gateau de pomme= apple cake, not apple cheese, because cheese=fromage so...
I'm a little confused...
Why do the apples need to be of the same size when you're going to cook them later?
Poor Edgar seems a little scared of our Mrs. Crocombe
She makes so much stuff with almonds! Were they readily available back then?
‘Gateau’ means cake. How does it come to be called ‘apple cheese’?
Why all of the dishes are made from custard isn't that noticed before
Gâteau du pomme would be apple cake? Where does "cheese" come from?
Delightful! How interesting. What would you have this with?? Toast? Crackers? Biscuits?
What sort of British accent is that?
Victorians ate such weird food
Did you mean ghetto like in uneducated?
When she was telling the guy what she was going to make the guy was like wtf
I’m pretty sure gâteau de pomme means apple cake
I hate it when I prepared for 10 and 14 arrive.
My mother never sent anyone away without offering them something to eat.  Maybe it was plain fare, but they were always free to refuse it.  Most, if they were hungry,  never did.  It might be just a skillet  of potatoes fried with onions,  some scrambled eggs, or vegetable greens from the garden,  seasoned with bacon, and hot pepper sauce, bread or biscuits.  Dried beans on the stove flavored with pork will feed a lot of people, served with cornbread.   One of my favorite memories is  of a trip I took through Central America and some of the poorest people invited me in to their humble homes and gave me the best of what they had to eat, a piece of left over chicken from their supper before,  and a bit of  cereal for breakfast.  It was the best they had, and I am humbled to this day by  memories of  their generous hospitality.  They  had so little, but they would share what they had.   My grandmother raised a dozen children.  They knew how to add more water to the soup pan.  When she lacked bacon for breakfast, she made salmon patties from a can.  One of my uncle's boyhood friends,  bragged,  as an adult,  about how good were the salmon patties and gravy and biscuits he ate at my grandmother's  breakfast table forty years earlier.   Hard times and fear of scarcity makes some more generous and some less so.  If someone is too arrogant to eat plain food or too proud to serve it, then they are not fit companions (com - pan- ion definition-" com"  (with) pan (bread) -someone you share bread with) anyway. The cook of the Lord and Lady must impress.  The rest of us not so much.
Will this work if I use honey instead of suggar? I can't have suggar because of some health issues... :(
gâtea de Pommes means apple cake not apple cheese 0:59
Gateau de Pommes means apple cake, but Fromage de Pommes is apple cheese.
Don’t you mean apple cake? Gateaux means cake, fromage is cheese.
“Gâteau de Pomme, or Apple Cheese.” Pomme=Apple and Gâteau=Cake. So, where does cheese come in to this?
Im french and we say « gâteau aux pommes » 😄
i’m confused why did she say “apple cheese” i thought gateau meant cake
Anyone else think the almonds look like nails?
How did i get here
Gâteau in French is cake. “Gâteau au chocolat” means “chocolate cake” so wouldn’t “Gâteau de pomme” mean “apple cake”???? If it was Apple cheese they’d use “fromage” which is cheese
So now that I know how to make Apple cheese, any advice on how to make my parents love me?
Why is it called apple cheese, but there is no chesse in the dessert?
looks disgusting
um gateau de pommes doesn't mean apple cheese XD XD XD XD it literally means cake of apples so an apple cake. Gateaux means cake, cheese is "frommage". I don't know who translated it....
Is this type of food still common in the UK? This is really not known in the US. The closest thing to this that we have would be a jello (jelly) salad— jello that is combined with fruit and possibly whipped or sour cream, placed in a mold and then refrigerated until set. It is sliced and then eaten. But these are really two different dishes. So I am interested to know more about this.
How is this called apple cheese when Gateau in French means cake?
All the wiseguy comments posted by kids on these videos are so lame
Very cool!
very pretty. How is it eaten? As a pudding would be or do you use it as a spread?
But why do the apples need to  the same size? They are cut up anyways
This looks so gross.
So someone would eat that for dinner?????
Oooh, been waiting for this one for weeks! Now to my American senses this is just a bit -- odd. But I'd be willing to give it a bash, as they say. I wonder if there are any 'non-such' apples state side :)
Isn't gateau a cookie or a cake in French? If so... isn't gateau de pommes... apple cake or smthn?
Ok wait, why "Gâteau de pommes" is translate by "apple cheese" I mean, it would be a "apple cake" no?
Why is so rude to the other people?
Do you just eat it with a spoon or do you slice it like a cake? Or does it go on bread? How do you eat it?
That doesn't't mean cheese, it means cake.
I’m still so confused with it being apple cheese when gâteau means cake, de means of, and pommes is apples.
How does gâteau de pommes translate to "apple cheese"....... fromage de pommes ou confiture de pommes.
Why would the need to be the same size if you're going to cut them up anyway?
gâteau translates to cake/or cookie/ pastry. Pommes = apples. How come gâteau de pommes translates  to apple cheese?!
Why does she insist at the start that all the apples have to be the same size?
Why's it called Gâteau de Pommes if you call it "Apple cheese" ? I thought it was gonna be a cake from the title. But i really wanna try some with that custard (minus the almonds cuz im allergic) -
TUBBY CUSTARD
Why does she need apples that have the same size? Or does Mrs. Crocombe actually have a sense if humour?
I don't know why but I want to fight her
Why don’t they ever smile?
So what does one do with one's apple... 'Cheese'? Does one spread it or dollop it on something? Is it a side or a dessert? What's with the custard moat? Google reveals nothing.
yawn
Why did they call it 'apple cheese'? Don't think there's any cheese in it
Am i the only who thought that since the sweet dish contains the word Pommes in it,It must contain Potatoes?
Apple cheese? I thought it meant apple cake? And wouldn’t it be Gâteau des Pommes rather than Gâteau de Pommes?
What difference does it matter if the apples have to be the same size if you’re going to basically crush them?
Mrs. Crocombe sees yall out there using canned ingredients. Mrs. Crocombe don't play dat😤
Omg literally 27 seconds ago
But...apple cheese would be something like Fromage du pomme...gâteau du pomme is apple cake (gâteau=cake, pomme=apple). Unless gâteau meant something else back then. I’m not French, I just learned it in school for a while, so if I’m incorrect then can someone who speaks the language correct me?
More and more and more notifications 😰 love the channel but what on earth is the point when you already get a notification when it comes out
Oh Mrs. Crocombe... I could sit under her shade-y apple tree all day long.
First, I thought it is from brazzers. JK
She and the apple boy are definitely banging
set reminder button   check
I got all excited and then - no video. booo.
With all due respect to English Heritage, because we love this channel and find Ms Crocombe, Mr. Vert and Edgar to be a warming hosts. BUT...please do not try and introduce a French-styled theme name for this recipe, because I don't think the French would ever -- I mean ever -- prepare this type of dessert.


Again, we love the channel and even watching this Gateau de Pommes recipe was a pleasure.
Good morning from SoCal, USA
Premiere setting is the worst!
They're mistranslating the name of the dessert. Gateau de Pommes literally translated is apple cake. They're translating it as "apple cheese." If that were the case, then it would be called Gateau de Frommage. Just saying. ☺🍏🎂
4 days??? vayanse a la verga...
Gross!🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Probably delicious and very pretty ! 
But I do feel like I need to be the prickly French once more (no insult to Mrs Crocombe, just a little remark) : "Gâteau de pommes" doesn't translate as "Apple Cheese", it's "Apple Cake" (besides, in french we would say "Gâteau aux pommes" but it's a detail), "Cheese" it's "Fromage". And, to be thorough, this recipe is actually what we call "Pâte de fruits" ("Fruit pasta" litteraly but I think you call that "Fruit Jelly"), but in France it's molded in a rectangular plate (thickness of approximatively 2 inches), and, after it's cooled, cut in cubes. We eat that like candies. It exists with many fruits, but apple jelly is a basic ! (Raspberry jelly though.... Yum ^^)
End of Year India will surpasses UK And became 5th largest economy in world ...😂😁😀
See we are on the way to great again..
Sooo pretty! Although "gateaux des pommes" does not mean "apple cheese". 😅
Apple cheese in French would be fromage de pommes. Gâteau de pommes is apple cake.
cringiest cooking show on youtube?
Uhm... The translation of Gâteau de pomme isn't apple cheese, it's apple cake...
Please don’t set this as a premier again. It is annoying and unnecessary. Just post the videos like you used to normally do. :)
Thanks so much to everyone at English Heritage for collaborating with us! This was so much fun.
Huh.... So that's how unboxing videos looked like in the 1800s. Who knew ?
Oddly, this makes me want to send someone a parcel with a handwritten letter attached 😄
Two of the most wholesome history channels together.
I could almost just die from the peace and happiness I feel.
Why do people dislike this magical timetravel?
Sees Mrs. Crocombe in a thumbnail of a new video
STOP EVERYTHING AND WATCH HER! :O
Two of my favourite historical channels unite! Yes!
Townsends is a lovely YouTube channel that explores early American life.  Also offers a most civilized YouTube community.
Don’t forget the nutmeg
Even the way she opens the package and takes out the ingredients is so in character. Hats off to this lady, she is a fantastic actress. 
Also, that pudding sounds DELICIOUS and, as an American, I can say that yes, it definitely seems characteristic of our classic historical treats. Seriously, corn is everywhere here. I'll absolutely be trying this recipe. It seems perfect for fall, even if the autumn season here in California doesn't get quite as chilly as in Indiana. 
Thank you for this wonderful crossover video. It was an absolute delight.

EDIT: (Nov. 5th, 2018) I made this yesterday and it's absolutely delicious. I'm looking forward to having some for dessert tonight. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! Here's how mine turned out: 
I honestly forget that I’m watching a modern women portray a character on a YouTube video when I watch these. The subtle nuances, like “Hmm, it doesn’t look very pretty. I think I cooked it to long.” make it so realistic. I love it.
United States of America... honestly those words were beautiful they way you said them. It sounded like what it meant from people back then. Full of Hope and opportunity and greatness to be had for all. Just an observation.
This is what YouTube should be all about, two countries working together to bring joy and some yummy grub to all
It's not a Townsends video without the nutmeg. LOL
Someone disliked this! Show yourself!!!
Maize is very nourishing, for people as well as for livestock. And the climate of America isn't always suitable for growing wheat, rye, or barley, so we make do with maize. But maple syrup is a great delicacy! I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
As a subscriber to both channels for some time now, I must make this special mention: Mrs Crocombe did not forget the nutmeg. 😂😂😂
Oh my goodness, wasn't this a lovely little collaboration!
I nearly died laughing when she said to not forget the nutmeg.
Mrs. Crocombe! It's Mrs. Crocombe. After a shitty, shitty day this is just the thing I need. Watching Mrs. Crocombe is like a big bowl of comfort food - minus the calories. (Though that chocolate pudding recipe and the pancakes and the victoria sandwiches and the trifle made me quite hungry!)
This is a crossover for the ages.
OMG-- I LOVE THE TOWNSENDS (on YouTube). The Victorian way and Townsend collab is quintessential, transcending location and epochs in time. I am so excited -- yesyesyes!!!! I love Mrs. Crocombe's snark and wit! LOVE IT.
English Heritage collaborated with Jamestown and Sons?! Super hybrid Victorian throwback Batman! You'll crash the internet with this level of Awesome!
Name a better youtube collab. Ill wait.
I loved her reaction to the finished pudding - both before and after tasting. I would love to see her modifications to make it suitable for Lord and Lady Braybrooke.
How long did it take for Letters or packages to get from one continent to another back then?
What was the mailing process?
"And don't forget the nutmeg!" hahaha this made my day! :D
Anyone loving but getting anxious too as she reads the letter, thinking that the video won't be long enough to prepare the recipe? 😁
Looks at the delicious pudding - Actually this doesn't look good enough to send upstairs without tasting it first.
when you're subscribed to both channels and have to choose which one to watch first
3:20 I have the honour to be your obedient servant,
A. Burr
I love both of these channels! I get so excited when they converse with one another. Perhaps Mr. Jon Townsend could pay a visit to Oddley End House?
I nearly died of laughter when the reciepi "don't forget the nutmeg" 😂
I can't wait to serve this on Thanksgiving. I think it'll be a great treat for my family
This may be one of the few times the servants eat better than the Lord and Lady of the the manor.
"And don't forget the nutmed"
AAAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Insider joke!
My two favourite "history channels" on youtube collaborating. It's like Birthday and Christmas in one go.
Mrs Crocombe's unboxing therapy
Opens letter...   "I cant read......." 

lol Jk I absolutely love this channel. Looking forward to more!
I LOVE this cross-over of two of my favourite channels! Avis Crocombe is one of my best loved characters on English Heritage and I am a devoted viewer Townsends! Thank-You
I love when you collab with Townsends. And I also loved that nod to Jon and his nutmeg, lol!
I think the thing I love most about this is that Mrs. Crocombe explains how she will go about it based on things she observes in the recipe, and then also shows & acknowledges that the end result was most likely not how it was supposed to come out and mentions what she would do differently in order to achieve the correct result for the next time. ♥♥
Mrs Crocombe!!! My night is made, thank you E.H. I'm so happy :) I wish Avis could read me books, she is just delightful to listen to
Yea, the Townsends and English Heritage together! Too Cool!! Rikki from Pennsylvania  =)
I've never clicked on anything faster than Townsends and English Heritage. ❤
I would love to see more of these crossover videos between the two channels. I don't know why they make me so happy, but they do. 😊
I'm loving these collaborations with Townsends' channel. Been a fan of both channels for a while. Keep up the good work!
YAY! Mrs. C! And a gift from Jon T! Perfect and SO yummy. So glad she tasted it on camera. Maybe the "higher" ups get a bit fancy but that slightly rough look didn't fool me lol! Blueberries? Sugar? Maize....and nutmeg? Come on! HAD to be yummy! Thanks EH. So excited when I saw this. Been wondering where she got to.🍮🍶🌽🎃🇬🇧🇺🇸
So exciting to see another collaboration between these two channels! You're both so awesome!
This may not look as good as Mrs. Crocombe would like, but it looks wonderful to me! Especially with some maple syrup! Mmm, now I'm hungry. Maybe I'll make blueberry pancakes for dinner...
omg I love J. Townsends as much as I love Mrs. Crocombe. This colab made my entire month.
1:12 the way she tells "United States of America" 😂😂
Oh, this warmed the cockles of my heart! I love how you did a time travel exchange box! So amazing. I love. Both your shows, and would love to participate one day! Bravo!
I found something faster than the speed of light:
me clicking on this video
Can we have more “The Victorian Way” I find it so satisfying and want to see what lady braybrooke etc would do in day to day life etc
These videos are seriously therapeutic in some way omg please keep those videos coming. I would love to see more Christmas specials this coming winter season. More power, keep it up! 💕
Love the collaboration! I hope you guys keep it up!
All the world is a stage and they all use nutmeg.
What a amazing Collaboration. Love all the videos your channels post so this is just the best. thank you so much for sharing.
Never clicked anything so fast. Shame we didn't get to see inside the items though
Mrs. Crocombe needs a P.O. box, so we can all send her letters and Christmas presents!
God bless Mrs. Crocombe; she remembered the nutmeg!
My two favorite historical food channels. Thank you so much from Maryland, USA
Oh my, I'd love to get a package
Suddenly this reminds me of the Pen pal culture we had in the 80's n early 90's.. snail mail posting of souvenirs..n humble beautiful poem like English letter writing..damn!! I miss those days😘😘😘 .. thank you Ms Crocombe
I adore this video!! How fun!!! Love both channels - keep doing a fabulous job!
A new The Victorian Way episode! yay!! Rejoice!
I swear it's like hearing those audiobooks as a kid in school. Honestly soothing.
And yes, never forget the nutmeg.
Thank you so much for your videos. I absolutely adore your videos and the Townsend’s videos💙 loyal subscriber💙
How cool! I'm already subscribed to both this channel and Townsends , so I've just watched his video and immediately after it on my subscription list was this! Brilliant! ❤️

I love that the two channels did this!!  I absolutely adore both channels.  :)

This looks really tasty, and I love that Mrs Crocombe tried it before sending it up to 'the big table'.  :D
this is so cool..ive independently been following both of you...as a canadian...i find this extra interesting and heartwarming...thank you so much both of you..Mrs.Crocombe and Mr.Townsend!!!!
I love the way she said United States of America. A land of opportunities, welcoming to people from all walks of life, free and working side by side to grow their nation. Sigh, what have we become today...
this is the most epic crossover!
Thank You Mrs. Crocombe, for including us in the unboxing of your Parcel from Mr. Townsend. I so enjoyed your comments, watching you make the pudding, your comments on how it turned out and the related reaction and its ultimate edible destination. 
If possible you might contact Mr. Townsend for more of Amelia Simmons recipes as they are always wonderful when Mr. Townsend, his darling daughter Ivy and associates make them.   Again, Thank You so much
The way you make videos is amazing .❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍😘😘😘😍😍
Excellent!  I love watching Towsends and when you two collab it makes me very, very happy :)
Loved this collaboration with Townsends!
More collaborations please! My two favorite history food channels!
This is wonderful! Thoroughly enjoying the continuation of this story line!
A collaboration made in heaven!  I always stop whatever I am doing whenever Townsends or Mrs. Crocombe are on.  You all are sublime.
The way Mrs. Crocombe pronounces morning is the best. 😍
will there ever be a copy of Mrs Crocombe`s cook book pleas.?
Alright now Miss C makes me want to find a pen pal from England so I can swap things with them along with an old fashioned hand written letter. Makes me wish for the days before mobile phone's and the internet....awww the good old day's
Hugs from Texas❤
Never thought I would live to see this collab. My life just instantly improved.
Top 10 anime crossovers. This is the internet I signed up for

In forever, We are truly love Mrs. Crocombe and her works
-love, SuikaProject
Would LOVE to send something you YOU for Christmas🎅 LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this channel!👍
I always love the music they use for the background, it fits really really well.
Awe, I ship Mr. Townsends and Mrs. Crocombe now... <3<3<3
Mrs Crocombe didn't think this pudding all the way from America (which her and the other servants thought delicious and devoured) was good enough for Mr Braybrookes table.....yet...she sent him that Trifle!!...🤔lol the shaaade
This is a just pure fun and very informative. My two favorite shows exist in the same historical universe. sigh... the world truly is a beautiful place.
Why can't these episodes be longer.. I love them!
The pudding isn't the prettiest dish I've ever seen, but it does look comforting and tasty.  The dried blueberries add a wonderful accent of color.

I think I might just have to try this dish out.
You are gorgeous! Love from Italy ❤️
Make this a thing, it would be the best soap opera ever, you both corresponding and sharing recipes. This was a great video. I love both your channels.
‘Mmm...this is quite good.  But it doesn’t look very nice, so i’ll just keep it for us servants’ 

I see what you’re doing, Mrs. Crocombe, and i approve wholeheartedly
This makes me so happy !!!! I follow both channels and enjoy all that I learn .
This is the best crossover episode ever!
wouldn't he have been sending it to lady braybrooke then?
lmfao k den
Wait... this was basically a historical COLLAB!  I'm speechless, this is so pure and beautiful, we need more internet like this <3
I absolutely love this. What are brilliant way to do a collab. I would love to see more.
1881? Her outfit is so 1850s and her hair is classic 1840s/50s. Lol
I find these videos really frustrating to watch, yet I can't stop watching them..
When two historical food channels take a page from the beauty channels and make a colab 😍😍... am shook !!
Damn, I'm asleep when this video came to existence....

Nevermind that I was 21 hours late! Can't wait to see more cooking videos to with Mrs Crocombe soon! XD
Omg I’m so happy! English Heritage and Townsends collabing! I wished for this to happen!😭🙌🏻
So mystery boxes were a thing back then as well!
0:43 I’d love if she just popped the top of and began to jug it. 😂
Another episode courtesy of the Royal Temporospatial Mail. 😀
I love this so much. keep making please x
We need more Townsends and English Heritage collaborations. These are priceless and so good for my soul.
I live in the United States and these two channels are my favorites! I'm so happy to see their collective effort in bringing history alive. Nothing better than Mrs. Crocombe and Mr Townsend! 😊
To homely to serve to the Upper Crust? Oh well, our gain, their loss 😉
From a New Englander part of whose family originated in Dorset, this just made my day.
Two of my personal favorite historical channels collaborating? Yes, please. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Fabulous.
Two of my fave historical channels collabed? Yes! ❤️
Charming! Love both of these channels! Well done!
I watch both of you guys, and when I saw that this was a collab, I flipped right out. YES!!!
I popped over from the Townsends channel. LOVE the video! I'm now subbed and looking forward to checking out your back catalog, as well as all of the new ones. THANKS!
Send a thank u next letter ❤️😂🌸
Love this collaboration! Haha 😍😘
I hope Mr. Townsend will be invited in the Audreyend.
I want nothing more than her reading me bedtime stories lol 🤗 5:21 am atm
Yes, I love these types of videos. I love when you guys share with each other. My two favorite reenactment channels collaborating to make wholesome content, bliss ♥️
Mrs. Crocombe: makes pudding in a fancy mold and decides "It doesn't look as good as I'd like."
Meanwhile at Townshend's, the pudding looks like they baked it in a bowl and turned it over. 
God I love these series.
Wonderful episode, as always. I wish I could send Mrs Crocombie a food parcel from my family to try!
👑 Get stuck in Lass ! Always have a try before her Ladyship !
This show (and Mr. Townsend's) are why I endeavor to perfect time travel. 
So far, all I've been able to do is move forward very slowly. I'll keep you all updated last week.
I LIVE FOR THESE VIDEOS. Best kind of collaboration ever.
I hope there will be an episode you will introduce Mr. Crocombe  😜
I wonder if Mrs Crocombe gets splayed over the kitchen table by Lord Braybrooke when Lady Braybrooke is not around
I really enjoyed both Mr. Townsend and this video. Thank you.
I love this collaboration, I watch both of them. Don't forget the Nutmeg, Mrs. Crocombe.

MY TWO FAVE HISTORY COOKING CHANNELS COLLABING? THIS IS SO PURE ❤❤
People back in the day really liked dry fruit 🤢 prefer mine fresh
Freaking love these videos, always stop whatever Im doing to watch them immediately! So relaxing, ASMR worthy tingles!
My Gram told me about sending packages back to England during the war.
Yay! Looking forward to more collaborations. 👏👏👏👍🤗
THIS IS SUCH A TREAT I WATCH BOTH OF THESE CHANNELS!
Can't believe first unboxing was in the 1800's
How about a date? Oh I forgot you're married.  😂
My two time-travelling cooking shows working together ! It must be Christmas :)
Again mrs. Crocombe throwing shades in her own convertion of ingred. 😂
Didn't know you existed until the Townsend's sent me.
Most excellent production you have all put together.
Thank you!
Well done! I thoroughly enjoyed this. It was the crossover episode that I never knew I needed.
And with this collaboration, the HCCU-- Historical Cooking Cinematic Universe-- was created! : )
This woman should be in Hollywood!   She is wonderful
The collaboration was really nice! I am a fan of both channels, so this was a real treat!
I love the details!

the way you compose the letter, know the English equivalents of American eggs (lol) and know the dish is more suitable to the servants
Yes, if Mr Townsend sent the recipe adding Nutmeg is a good idea. I love the exchanges the two of you do. They are great fun. Now I need to go see Jon's video, since YouTube showed me yours first.
What a joy to have two of my very favorite cooking channels collaborating.  Marvelous video!  My humble thanks to both the English Heritage and the Townsends!
This is great. Thanks all for working together on this project.
I literally am crying over this...no idea why.So very lovely to get a glimpse of our ancestors ways....so beautiful and touches my heart.❤
Nutmeg!! Haha.

Also, one wonders whether this is classic Mrs Crocombe shade with regards to the British ingredient measures and eggs being larger ;)
I absolutely LOVE this, the wonderful interaction and sharing of recipes and foods.  Such a terrific collaboration!
Grettings from Chile 🇨🇱 miss victorian!!! your recipes are very good!!!
Yup - no ill effect from consuming maize regularly... in fact, my littles love corn meal mash for breakfast on a cold day!
Even Mrs Crowcombe has got in on this YouTube unboxing fad. Love it!
Excuse me her reading the letter was like, the first time I’ve seen the Mrs. so happy. I literally teared up. I think I stan too hard.
I love this as I am subscribed to both. Well done!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I could watch these ALL day. Please don’t ever stop producing them lol
The only people who dislike the video are French😂😂
She's low-key judgingng America while she reads the recipe 
And honestly I'm living for it
Yesss! Finally! 
I have been waiting so long for the second part of this lovely collaboration! 
I really hope to see more of this lovely communication between John and Mrs Crocombe in the future! <3 

PS, I was wondering if Mrs Crobombe would mention the nutmeg! Luckily she did! ;-)
This was lovely! I like when two of my favorite channels interact!
i LOVE Mrs Crocombe videos !! but am dismayed by the 10 dislikes
If you love History, you will love these series. Thanks so much for making it "real."
The Townsend's brought me here. I have so enjoyed this collaboration, now I'm off to watch more of your videos!
Mrs Crocombe be munching on maze ...Chomp! Chomp! Chomp!
Soooo cool!!! Thumbs up to request officially a "Japanese treats taste test challenge" .. Though, the Victorian way, of course 🤣🤣🤣
I lol-ed as soon as she said nutmeg XD;;;; It's pretty much not a @Townsends recipe without it XD;;;;

Also, did Mrs. Crocombe ever make one that was suitable for Lady Braebrook? ^.^
I love these videos when you share recipes across the Atlantic. So nice. I love the letters as well. Thank you.
I loved this video.
 Btw… anyone interested in showing me around your world of fall and halloween via facebook?
Genuine friendship is expected.
I love these collaborations so much. Two of my favorite historical channels.
Please keep it up!  I LOVE these!!!  The "American-twist" was totally fun!!
mrs. crocombe videos are so lovely 😍
Hola!!, gracias por estos hermosos videos!! Me encantarían pudieran subtitularlos al menos al español!!
CORNBREAD    delicious!!!
The fact that  they waited a realistic amount of time for the shipping to upload this makes this all the more great!
Mrs Crocombe says the '' UPPER ''servants always have leftovers for supper--wonder what the lower servants get if anything
I love it that I'm not the only history geek and anglophile that adores this crossover!
Should've been a big meaty steak, a bottle of Tennessee whiskey, some corn and bread and a nice 12 gauge strap, with ammo.
not quite pretty but look delicious! 😍💕
Wonderful! I kinda like how it took quite a while for this video to come out; it almost simulates the lengthy voyage that was required to send a package from America to England in the old days.
18th century unboxing videos >.< !!
I had no clue. I have enjoyed both videos for a short time. I find this brilliantly fascinating. As a Hoosier, am really fascinated. Looking forward to more crossover videos.
How wonderful! Love this charming collaboration.
Oh, yeah! A crossover special. Like Marvel meets DC.
A collab between my two favorite historical channels! I love this!!
I've been watching both channels for a while, now. I'm so glad for the collaboration. You should do more in the future ☺
You can't forget the nutmeg! Mr. Townsend won't hear of it!
tbh i wish they put taco bell and mcdonalds stuff in the box as a joke XD
Nice video but Townsend is like in the 18th century i.e 1700's and Victorian era was 100 years after 19th century i.e 1800....Oh well maybe she got a time machine and his mail is slow. But nice concept
This collaboration has been so much fun to watch!  Thanks!!!
love these videos with Mrs. Crocombe!!
love to see how cooking was performed before all of our modern day culinary conveniences!! thank you so much for the collaboration with Mr. Townsend!!
please keep the collaborations coming!!
This is the most underrated collab of 2018
I love both of your channels. I love this collab!
A Mrs Crocombe unboxing, yea!!!
Two of my favorite channels together. Thank you
These packages, omg, they're traveling through time! Though he sent that back in the late 1700s (you can tell by the Townsend's clothes), and she's just getting it in 1881. Must be stale by now
Side note, I think Avis and Jon should get married, she becomes Ivy's stepmom
A Victorian era collaboration, unboxing, and “I followed” video?! 😍😍😍
Just discovered this channel from Townsend's video... Good gravy, how i LOVE this stuff. I'm literally in heaven!
I'm actually freaking out, this is so wonderful that you both have collabed! Love this! ❤️
I was not aware that the post office held onto boxes for that many decades. Good to know.
As a fan of both channels its great seeing the collaboration.
I do love these videos so much.
So... takes another bite ... Somehow, this pudding never made it to the upper servants' table. ;-)
This collaboration was amazing, keep them coming !  and the photography of these videos is incredible.
Don't forget Ms. Ivy in your letter.
To quote Cher, "if I could turn back time..."  Well Mrs. Crocombe and Jon Townsend do a great job of it!
I thoroughly enjoyed the show. As do I enjoy Mr. Townsend's conveyance of history in living view. As a southerner we pride ourselves in recipes from our past that are so common today we tend to forget there more humble beginning's. Thank you for the care you take in this show and keep it up
You have no idea how much I have been missing you, Mrs. Crocombe!!
New subscriber, visiting from Townsends.  The collaboration was fantastic and a truly great production.  Thank you.

English heritage and townsends: Hold my beer
What a treat these videos are, such a source of joy, thank you!!
What a delight. There is noting like watching a "Mrs. Crocombe" video to inspire one to cook the "English" way.
"The Earliest" Lol :D So it's not even 100 years old?
Sounds a lot like "Cornbread".  Serve it with butter and honey, it goes well with BBQ.
I love you Mrs. Crocombe. LOL greetings from Sri Lanka. cant wait to see your next recipe. ..
Thankyou for sharing your cooking,  of the American Recipe
Dear Mrs. Crocombe,
I regret I must inform you of a small but rather serious breach of etiquette that has occurred with this video.  It is my firm belief that this breach was but an unintended oversight, yet knowing of your attention to detail and your strict adherence to propriety, I would be remiss if I did not call it to your attention.  
During crossovers, it is customary to include within the description a link to the video, or at least to the channel, of one's collaborator.  I fear I cannot find such a link to Townsend's channel in this video's description.  Again, I am sure this was simply an accident, as I had noted links to Townsend's channel in your previous crossover video.  Indeed, I am sure the blame, if indeed "blame" is the accurate word to use in this instance, falls to the Poster of the Videos and not to your good self.  
I would be most obliged, then, if you might pass this message on to the party who is able to remedy this unfortunate situation.  I have always found your videos to be most entertaining in addition to educational, and I am honored to offer aid in upholding the sterling quality of this channel.
Sincerely,
Pompe221
With having graduated from school this past week, and gardening done yesterday, I have to fill my time with something so, I'll be making this today! 😋🍰🎂
"And don't forget the nutmeg" as is the Townsend way! <3
Music makes me feel like I'm playing Sims :)
These videos have been the best birthday gift I could ask for. Thank you, Townsends and English Heritage, for such a lovely and heartwarming collaboration.
I just love these videos so much!
Two of my favorite YT channels, English Heritage and Townsends!
A nice idea to do exchanges, looking forward to seeing more in the future.
Loved the video and collaboration! I made it today, using a cup of sugar, a heavy sprinkle of each spice, and a bundt pan. It took almost two hours, but I think my oven runs low. It tastes like French toast!
Somehow this video made me want to cry. Life used to be so simple
Love the personal and historical touch that was put into this recipe box. Blue Apron better watch out, hehe.
Hello! My mom passed away about 11 years ago. And you look exactly like her. so whenever I watch your videos I cry from beginning to end. thank you for existing. lots of love from Lebanon.
the Victorian way AND Townsends? dreams do come true!
Thank you English Heriy! Mrs Crocombe!!! Love this series.
:O It came from John Townsend!
Knowing Townsend, "Spice" means Nutmeg for sure.
This exchange is precious. Thank you!
It happened! I have wanted this since finding both of the channels.
Did...did you guys actually post these to each other? Using present-day postal service? This is so meta. Omg. <3

“Hmm, we often have quite large eggs...” 😏
I do look forward to these collaborations. They're such wonderful fun.
this is so relaxing to watch idk why
I love your collabs with Townsends!!  Do more! Wonderful to see you again Mrs. Crocombe!
This video made me so happy I almost cried :((( This is just so perfect!
How did I miss this collaboration? I adore both of these channels! Super cool!
Mrs. Crocombe, Townsends, and ASMR cooking/unboxing sounds... I have died and gone to heaven.
This interaction between two channels are so beautiful and heartwarming I'm cryingggggg
Top 10 Best Anime Crossover.
Charming companion videos!  If we still have fresh blueberries in our market here in Virginia, I'll give this a try.
Mrs Crocombe please drop your skin care routine. Thank you.
Mrs Crocombe please drop your skin care routine. Thank you.
This is the best collab in the "history" of collabs!
Pleeeeaaase make more videos about mrs Crocombe.
This is such a brilliant job giving people a chance to peek inside our past more realistically, making people feel like those who lived at that moment are not from history books but our neighbours. I just appreciate this channel for making and putting effort on these wonderful videos.
Love!! New subscriber here!  Sent from Mr. Townsend!
Saw the Townsends Video Nearly died with excitement!
"spice....hmm....I wonder if he mentions WHICH ones". shade.....you can hear the eye roll.
The shade, thanks for the recipe worthy of being leftovers ahhah
She's just like my mother. Changing the ingredients before she even tries the recipe 😂
This collaboration makes me so happy 💕
I LOVE when you and Mr Townsend correspond with each other!!!
i absolutely love this
How much fun was this video👍🏻! Love how it stays in character even including the packaging and letter writing. Wonderful. I’m going to try the recipe, too😋.
I literally fall in love with this wonderful channel, the best in the world, indeed.
I'm so glad I found this channel! So sweet.
I noticed i had not yet watched this Mrs. Crocombe video but didn't pay attention to the title. I was delighted to see if was a collaboration of two of my favorite YouTube channels.
When two of your fav channels collide!! Flipping magic.
I enjoy Mrs. Crocombe and these glimpses into Victorian cooking and living.
The way she utters those words 'United States of America' (@1.12)and the gestures at the moments were OMG
THIS IS EVERYTHING,! I cannot tell you how much I enjoy these videos, and this collab is literally one of a kind. MORE!!! <3
.     yay....it's Mrs. Crocombe    👍👍👍
Simply a delight.  Please make more.
4:11 uhhh girl, the shade. Mrs Crocombe the fierciest queen of the victorian era
Please dont EVER stop making videos with Mrs.Crocombe
SHE IS THE BEST!
I love that the spice is not mentioned certainly, well it is on her hands now, and the recipe work.
I freaking love this collab!
Top 10 greatest anime crossovers of all time.
Thank you Mrs. C.  Like this time of life.  The heritage, recipes and information collected here and at Townsend's is amazing.  From Texas.   You are now nutmeg mama.  Jon is nutmeg daddy.
Yo we're afraid to eat food that's been out for a few hours and they're sending ingredients across a freaking ocean 😂. Awesome vid!
Delightful! Well done. 🇬🇧🇺🇸
Watch your videos, it's a pleasure! You are a pleasure to listen to! Live long! From Russia with love!... Signed ap!)
I do hope this continues.  I love to watch the exchanging of recipes!
I love her british accent it makes me feel so british😂
this crossover beats the avengers any day
This. Is. AMAZING!!!! Unfortunately I am severely allergic to corn which makes eating a NIGHTMARE!!! Love both channels x
Old school unboxing video!
I loved hearing you read the letter!
I JUST BINGED ALL THE TOWNSEND AND VICTORIAN WAY VIDEOS LAST NIGHT AND I COME HOME TO THIS 😭😭 THANK YOU SO MUCH IM SO HAPPY. HELLO FROM CONNECTICUT, USA
This is it. The greatest crossover in all of history. Nothing will ever top this.
wow 16 dislikes and 4,200 likes shows you how amazing this channel is
Omg yay!! I’ve missed Miss Crocombe ❤️
Hello, Mrs. Crocombe :) It's always lovely to see you. Thank you.
I watched the sending from Townsends enchanted, now my joy is complete! 👍🌟😋
Oh yes you mustn't forget the Nutmeg. :) We love the Nutmeg in fact i spend quite a lot of time in the Nutmeg Tavern. Oh yes do not forget the Maple Syrup.
An amazing dream come true! 😋💖💖
Love it, both English Heritage and The Townsends
Awww! Love this video. Why they make us wait so much for them? I'll try this recipe. Much blessings to all who make possible this videos...Blessed be...👋👋👋👍👍👍
Back when the box you shipped something in cost more then the actual item in it! ... wait...little has changed. LOL
Adorable, keep this coming!
There it is!

N U T M E G
This is a collaboration I never knew I needed. :)  What a wonderful collaboration video and I hope you two do more!
The Townsend and Victorian Way cross overs are my favorites.
I love Indian Pudding! Usually it's made with molasses and no blueberries though.
Oh my, I have enjoyed this collaboration more than expected!
You impertinent fool! Ugly or not, that pudding was for the Lady!
When your two wholesome historical favs unite! This is why I come to this site.
I really enjoy these wonderful videos.  Living near Indiana, I am truly delighted to see this "midwestern recipe!"
The people who disliked this must be from Indiana! HAHAHA!
I love this! English Heritage and Townsends are two of my favorite channels!
Thank-you so very much, these are my favorite. More please!!!
my grandma actually makes smthg like that 😂
Just what 
I needed!
This channel is so aesthetically pleasing!
Mrs. Crocombe doing unboxing vidz before it was mainstream. Lol.
Dear, DEAR Mrs Crocombe. Oh how we've missed you~~ xo
Oh my goodness this is awesome!!!
71 people are currently in a earthquake, causing too much shakiness. And they missed the like button and mistakenly clicked dislike because of it.
This is not a dream. So shocked yet I'm hyped on this collab
Awww...this was delightful. I love the back and forth between Mr. Townsend and Mrs. Crocombe, and always enjoy watching the food prepared. Thank you to all involved for this!
I think it's so amazing that two historical reenactors from across the world communicate via letter, just as they did in the eighteenth century. Using the same materials and the same grammar. 

It's only a bonus that we get to watch it on youtube.
I make this with molasses. I never tried with blueberries.
this is so wholesome. i very much so enjoyed it
Great collaboration between the two. Look forward to more. Thanks for introducing me to a new channel!!!
Just subscribed thanks to Me. Townsends. I look forward to learning from your videos.
one day i was scrolling down my suggestions and saw this channel and watched this and even though im just a child I LOVE THIS KIND OF VIDEOS Mrs. Crocombe is my favorite💜
I don't think Lady Braybrooke will be so arrogant to think this pudding is "servants' food". Don't make decisions for her! You're just a maid!
Being from Indiana we have corn  corn and piles of corn 🌽
Haul vids have NOTHING on this masterpiece
This was a uniquely enjoyable episode! I would love to see more of this!
BEST COLLAB EVEERRRR! :)
I love the relationship between the two channels!
This is the collab I wanted and needed
my two faves Townsend and Mrs Croc
Love that you and Townsend got together and collaborated on a video!!! So lovely
At first, I thought Mrs. Crocombe was displeased with the taste. I was relieved when she said that "it's very good".
I really enjoyed the video ,interesting recipe I might try that ,I hope you do more of these.
Love these collaboration videos! I always look forward to another visit from Mrs. Crocombe!
Just started to get caught up on Townsend's videos & watched them packing this yesterday & then saw this. Great stuff both are wonderful channels!
Came from Townsends and just subscribed. Cant wait to binge watch you content.
Servants are served with leftovers. So what if there's none left??
Oh shiiiiiiit hottest collab of 2018 🔥🔥🔥
i think i'll make this for thanksgiving. great collaboration
Indiana??? HELL YA! HOOSIERS! Born and raised here!
😂Cornbread with blueberries is what I took away from this. But maybe it you added more flour, buttermilk, and joney it would have been fluffy too and not so weird back then.
The ceramic bottle said made in china
the two channels are just so amazing
This has been one of my favorite videos yet! I have a recipe for Indian pudding that has been in my family for about 100-150 years from New England and it is one of my favorite dishes. This video brought me back home, so thank you!
I came straight here from Townsend’s.  I’ve enjoyed this collaboration so much!  Thank you all
Whatever you do, DON'T FORGET THE NUTMEG!
Delightful - thanks for upload.
Everything is so old and peaceful, i love it!!
Top 10 anime crossovers
"spice" --> nutmeg!
I love this collaboration! These are two of my favorite YouTube channels.
Im from Indiana so that kind of threw me off guard lol
This correspondence you have with English Heritage is loads of fun....
One American pint is 16 fluid ounces. One “Imperial” (British) pint is 20 fluid ounces.  But I’m not sure if American and British ounces are the same size.
I'm a big fan of the Townsends channel and just watched their English Heritage collaboration video and came over to checkout your channel. Good video.
"Don't forget the nutmeg" -I caught that! You now how Mr. Townsend loves his nutmeg!
a historical gift "Haul"
Wow that was fast!  I didn't know they had such quick trans-Atlantic shipping back then :3
Going back to old days ! How i wish to be born in the 1800's !
OHMYGOOOOOOODDDDD AS A LONG TIME TOWNSENDS SUBSCRIBER THIS MAKE ME SO HAPPYYY!!!!!!!!!!
i always, always wonder if these two historic channels would do a collab bcs that would be epic!!! Here here it is!!! Aaagghh im so happyy!!!! Thankyouuu
Okay so apparently I am the only one who saw the hammer appearing in the second shot. And then disappearing with the fourth or fifth scene? 
Lovely. That nobleman sent you magic, Mrs. Crocombe. 😅
That looks wonderful I love blueberries
I had no idea she was from Devon? The same county as me!
I love the Townsends! This was a nice treat and look forward to more collab's in the future!
This channel is the gentle kiss of a soft blanket to my soul.
Yes mrs crocombe reppin Devon!!!
Are both shows set in 1881 with historically accurate tools and dress?
" And don't forget the nutmeg" ❤❤❤

What a delightful episode. I enjoyed it very much.
Dear Mrs. Crocombe its good to see you again.  Thank you English Heritage for yet another episode.  A pleasant blend of two of my favorite channels. I still want to the see the glass houses on the estate.
lol, she's all like everything is bigger here in England xD
I thought she was gonna say sugar,spice and everything nice lol
This is so delightful, it's very neat to see these two people who share such a love of history interacting :D
I absolutely loved this video! Thank you English Heritage, for presenting such an interesting and entertaining show!
Correct me if I am wrong, but Townsends live in the 18thC while Queen Victoria was ruling in the 19th century.
HOTTEST COLLAB OF 2018 🔥🔥🔥
It took me a little bit too long to realize it was a blueberry cornbread recipe 😂
Just about everything is better with maple syrup.
Opens up a Happy Meal.
Quality content as usual ❤️❤️❤️
Best unboxing ever!

I love this collaboration!  More more! :)
What a lovely bird!  Cheers, from the backwaters of Virginny.
Yay, I'm so happy we get to see Mrs. Crocombe receive a package back!
Townsend and Mrs Crocombe is the real OTP
What a great idea! i love this channel
Oh, this is fantastic!! I wasnt aware of your channel before this collaboration with Townsend. 😁
she didnt actually taste the pudding!!
These videos are so soothing and comforting, i especially love to watch them around christmas time, thank you to all that make these videos a reality
This is one of the neatest collaborations ever!!
Two of my favorite channels combined :'-)))
I really love your channel I’m Arabian from Kuwait 🇰🇼 but I’m in love with the English history 😍😍
Our beloved Mavis!💖
Love from Indiana! 💕
am i  the only one feeling extra relaxed watching these videos?
I love this woman’s presentation skills, compulsive viewing 🙋🏽👍🏽
IM QUAKING IN MY BOOTS RIGHT NOW!!!!!! MY TWO FAVORITE CHANNELS HAVE COLLABORATED AND I LITERALLY COULD NOT FEEL ANY MORE JOY THAN I DO IN THIS MOMENT!!!!!!!!!! YOU'D THINK I JUST EXPERIENCED THE BIRTH OF MY FIRST BORN CHILD LMAO
Ms Crocombe and Mr Benedict Cucumber would make a fine pair. Pardon my French
I miss you 😘 welcome back ❤️
Love you both. Thanks.
I swear to God, my insomnia started to kick in and when I saw that Mrs. Crocombe had a new episode, I watched it and now I feel sleepy. It's 4:00 AM from where I'm from. @_@ SHEEEEEE'S BAAAAAAAACK OMG OMG
America would send dog food 😂😂
Just watched the Townsend episode and this one back to back - brilliant.
Most well thought out collab I’ve seen on YouTube!
Love how the two series blend. Please do more.
I just smiled the whole time. What a fun and lovely collaboration.
Greatings from Southern Illinois, USA. I  have been a subscriber to John Townsends channel for quite a while now. I had no idea he was doing a collaboration  with a channel from England! I knew of a collaboration he does on occation with Coalcracker Bushcraft. I have allready subscribed to his channel. I have also subscribed to yours as well! I love this!! Cheers!!!
Love the way she says " Mr. Towns-end"
This is so beautiful. Two wonderful channels
I enjoy both these channels, and since I'm from Indiana particularly enjoyed this episode of English Heritage. I've served Indian Pudding, but never tried making it with dried blueberries.
"Spice" usually meant a common mix of sweet spices known in medieval times as Poudre Douce. It was a lot like pumpkin pie spice with anise and/or cardamom added into it too.
I love these videos so much, specifically the Mrs. Crocombe ones.
I'm on another Mrs C binge
I have been making Indian pudding every Thanksgiving since I was 12 years old. No more dried blueberries in Indian pudding. It used to take me hours all day in the oven to make an Indian pudding and I developed the way to do it on top of the stove which comes out I think nicer than the oven version. It is always served piping hot with vanilla ice cream on top. :-)
Greetings from Texas USA God bless the USA I would never live permanently anywhere else
I wish that the videos were longer... :( 
I love love looove this channel. 
And I LOVE England so much, one day I will move to Cornwall ❤️ my favourite place in the hole world 🌍 
Please 🙏🏻 update more frequently, I’m begging you guys 🙈❤️🙏🏻 yours sincerely/ Elin from Sweden 🇸🇪
ORTUM. ARMONDS. THIS IS THE BEST.
Please include this in the Mrs Crocombe cook book when it is released.  I am living for the prospect of that cook book!
Another amazing video about Mrs. Crocombe :)
If you watch his channel ' spice" means nutmeg no exceptions. Not now or ever. Its always nutmeg 😂
How can anyone thumbs down these things?
That reveal was iconic “hmm...”
I think that pudding would be best served hot.
Now all we need to do is convince the Hallmark Channel to turn this into a Christmas movie: A Courtship For Mrs. Crocombe. I'd watch that. She deserves a little romance in her life. 💘
I love the EH videos - especially the Mrs Crocombe ones!
Pure enjoyment to partake with you.
Love só  much this is Magic 😍😍
I was think about this just the other day. I am so glad he did find something American to send.
sugar
spice
and everything nice
AHHHH the nutmeg reference! I love these channels so much!!
OG 1800s unboxing video
No oh look. A new mrs crocombe video. Opens it. Doesnt watch until the end. Presses like anyway.
victorian era unboxing video from lord townsend. 😂
"And don't forget the nutmeg!"
making that!!  haven't had since i was young!
I cannot click like enough times for this video! ❤️
"Dear Mr. Townsends, thank you for sending us food fit for a servant"
typical british foods/goods ...

aren't you british too
pkz make more cooking videos love them just found channel
The videos just keep getting better and better. Love this!
These videos always make me feel comfortable and at home, even when I'm not
Best penpal ever! That looked weird, but sounded like it was delicious all the same.
LiberTea strikes again
I'd have been disappointed if there was no nutmeg!
<3 Shipping this crossover!
Best unboxing video ever
Never forget the nutmeg. It would be unthinkable
So mr Townsend and mrs Crocombe are pen pals! This is cool!
This is so lovely! Absolutely marvelous production and great acting.
Good stuff. Always a pleasure
As soon as she said Indiana I was like "I live there! Next to Notre Dame!" 😂 Hoosiers!
Im delighted that Townsend has someone to collab with!!  This is awesome!
Not enough people have had the delight of Indian Pudding... a delicious treat I have made often over the years.
What an adorable way to do a collab!
hello mrs crocombe!!❤from india
Brilliant!  In concept and execution.
This was on my recommended today, glad I clicked to this. 😃
C R O S S O V E R A U
That looks so good Mrs.  Crocombe 😍
I think I'm developing a crush on Mrs. Crocombe. Probably one among many. She looks so eminently cuddly. I do wish she would do more meat dishes, though...
Absolutely darling. I live for these videosss!
By the way the music is calming.
If that was delivered from what we have for a delivery system in America now, it would have already been mixed and ready for her to make- LOL
Every time I watch one of these videos I get distracted by those glasses looking like they're about to slide off. Seriously, it gives me phantom nose discomfort and makes me keep wanting to touch my own glasses every few seconds.
I didn't get it what's with the nutmeg??
Mrs Crocombe didn’t get a package of soul food then?
Best collaboration EVER!!!
That's odd... I always thought there was some 100 to 150 years in between these two channels...
I love the american cookery! I'll make this recipe one of these days... the most interesting part will be choosing the surprise spice.
Everything is so cute !!
Great video and I enjoyed the Townsend’s video
the unboxing we didn't know we needed!
This would be so much better if it were Asmr
This collab is everything!
You click like even before the ad is finished because you know it’s going to be brilliant.
No this is not pudding its corn bread
Awesome collaboration with Jon Townsends, the future possibility are endless! Sub’d
Why do I know that this is Abigail Adams’s favorite food/dish😂
This is incredibly cute.
I hope there are other puertorican fans that watch this show and think "Ima show this to grandma" and then grandma be like

Mera, ¿qué 'stá'ciendo la gente blanca ésta?!
Mr Townsend sends a package in the 18th century... Mrs Crocombe receives it 100 years later. I see Royal Mail hasn't changed much!
OMG Didn';t even know these two chanels knew each other, mind blown!  LOVE it!
These videos make me so happy ^_^
I watched him and his daughter make that parcels
That looks damn delicious
The nutmeg, oh my gosh
God I love her! It really brightens up my day when I see her in a thumbnail for a new video :D
So cuuute❤️
I'm curious to know if gallons, pints, and quarts are still used in Britain.  In Canada, the imperial gallon survived metrification, but after NAFTA, has been completely supplemented by the US gallon.
SOOOOOOO awesome you guys did a cross over!!!!
the first ever unboxing video in history?

also what was that liquid in the jar?
What a wonderful video... a travel through time ✨
OMG! I could spend a lifetime watching this!!!!
Does anyone have any more channels like this that they can recommend? Really fell in love with this, and I'm not sure where I can find more 😍
that looked good. :D made me hungry.
original Queen of unboxings
How could I ask for something better than two of my favorite channels collaborating together? I loved both videos to pieces and hope there might be more in the future! Mrs. Crocombe, please show us if you try to perfect this recipe so the Braybrooks may get a taste of the Americas as well!
The Queen herself <333 Adoring these videos ^^
Oh no! You don't cut the strings. You untie them and save them for later :-)
Came in from the Nutmeg Tavern anyone?
XD I wasn't sure this was what I thought it was at first, OMG it is!!! This is so great, I'm hooked.
Wholesome video and comments.
Finally.
Im freaking out! Im so happy bacause of this colab!!!!
BEST CROSSOVER EPISODE
Greatest burns of all time
Unboxing vids from across time. So whimsical
Yassss queen!!! you are back! We missed you!
God, this is so wholesome.
lol very well done Mrs. Crocombe the only  'non-authentic" part of the scene looks like the letter was written with a biro rather than with quill and ink! But its a very nice production on how Victorians did things well done.
Yay I was wondering when these two would trade something to one another
Growing up on a New England farm, we called it blueberry buckle. I always thought it funny it was the only old quick cake recipe that called for cornmeal. We used a maple sugar/butter/flour crumb for the top. (We always used the saved up hard lump maple sugar that escaped the candy maker, bashed in a jelly bag with a rolling pin (a much loved chore) which we saved up in mason jars.  My Scottish Nana always used oats in the crumb too, to have "a wee bit of the old taste."  
peace all

I was unaware that Maize corn was considered low class in England. Is it still that way?
Hey! I am from Indiana!
It’s pretty much cornbread with blueberries lmao
5:47 mmmmm
This is wonderful!
Top 10 Anime Crossovers
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SERIES
Two of my favourite channels, coming together in a trans-Atlantic collaboration. Christmas has come early!!
I hope you can do more collaborations with Townsends.  This was so much fun!  Thank you!
Awww.. Cover it with whip cream and garnish and it will be heavenly
I wish you all can be in the same video one day! It will definitely be amazing.
I can’t get enough of these videos I hope you keep doing them
So a blueberry corn muffin?
This is so soothing and relaxing.
wow... collaborating with Townsends is awesome! i am both subscriber of yours.
Yas!!  Finally
I just realized WHY this has been eating at me! I did a tally of the foods in my house and I happen to have all of these ingredients on hand! I'M SO EXCITED!! I feel like I should try drying the blueberries or just use them fresh though...?
Mrs Crocombe’s smile when she read “United States of America” was so lovely. You can see her proper demeanor fade away for just a moment with how excited she is.
Absolutely enjoyable ❤
Omg omg omg omg how exciting!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💃🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💃🏻🙌🏻💃🏻🙌🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
This was a very fun adventure and I love seeing two of my favorite worlds collide like this. I hope y’all collaborate again in the future like this!!! Very entertaining.
They're so realistic. I started watching this series in May when the package was sent.
Oh I knew there would be nutmeg
Love both your channels. Thank you for the cross over. So fun!
I LOVE WHEN YALL GET TOGETHER
This is interesting, relaxing & educational. Congratulations!
I liked how both of you came together to make it seem so real and historical.
Dearest Mrs crocombe what a wonderful grainy rough pudding you tried that is probably what colonists enjoyed here in the new world, and I see that warm with custard as a great treat after supper.
Love it!! Keep em coming. So interesting and is a delight
Wish I could have her accent ..
Loved it!
I thought it was going to be a big hamburger and some fries. 😂🤣
Mrs Crocombe cheers me up!  I love these videos.
I LOVE THIS CHANEL!
IT IS AMAZING!
Best crossover since Infinity War.
You look like my aunt.
I've been waiting. It's about time.
I enjoy this series so so much! It’s always a lovely treat... thank you to all the people that work hard on it!
YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!
Amazing collab I'm so shook
Just beautiful!!
“Don’t forget the nutmeg” NEVER! #nutmegislife
What a delightful video. I'm here from Townsends, and so glad to be here.
Crocombe is that a french name? I bet
Oh my God!Oh my God!Oh my God! Mrs. Crocombe and Jas.Townsends&sons!!!!! I'm losing my fricking mind!!!
What a cool way to do an unboxing style video while maintaining the integrity of the show
This is so interesting! What interesting differences between measurements. I've often wondered.
These videos are so calming ✨
Too sweet! :D
I missed her so much!!!!
I didn't know I needed this. But I definitely did.
Hit like before I even watched. a crappy day immediately started looking up with the return of the one true Victorian queen.
I'm drooling at the cookware, kitchenware and every thing she uses in the kitchen....
This is so wholesome
Crossover of the year!
I love this buttttt no one open a parcel like that
Yummy!! Thank you for another wonderful video! I literally smile when I see Mrs Crocombe in my video feed!
It is 2:48 am.    I’m in bed watching my favorite cooking channel and Mrs. Crocombe.   You’ve taken me back in time to a more gentler world.   Thank you.
It's so wonderful to see Mrs Crocombe again!
Do the English still not eat corn? or cornmeal?   

My great grandfather had a joke he told in the 1800's that has been passed down.  An Englishman tries corn on the cobb for the first time and likes it.  So he asks the waiter for more beans on the stick.

I didn't say it was a good joke--just a little look into the pioneer perspective from the Civil War era.  I love both of these channels!
I cringed when she cut the twine rather than thrifty untying it to reuse. This was  not  a modern, disposable life.
They’re expanding the historical cooking cinematic universe
Wow I'm so happy that I watched this :D in an odd way this can very much be asmr ! So many tingles at times :D
Such a fun collaboration! Two of my favorite series on YouTube! Thanks you both for this!! :)
The queen is back yaaaasss 🙏🏼🙌🏼
And a mention of adorable little miss ivy!!!!
And people say Avengers was an ambitious crossover...
wasn't the fountain pen invented 1884.. and the ball point in 1888.. thought it was cute ... to see that i was written in ball point pen.
The crossover of a couple centuries ago.
I hope this series will not end😭 i love this 😍
I SHIP IT
I love watching both of your channels.  it is so nice how you combined Mr. Townsend on your episode.
She didn't let it bake long enough I think. It looks really better in the Townsends vid.
Absolutely love this collaboration!
this is the crossover I didn't know I needed
That was really interesting!
Wow, I remember watching a Townsend video a while back where Jon and Ivy received a package from England and prepared the contents, I remember them saying something about returning the favour, but I never knew there was a kind of part 2 to this!
One must not forget the nutmeg.😁
I would adore to see a series made about correspondence between Mr. Townsend and Mrs. Crocombe!
Oh Mrs Crocombe you make my day
Damn, kinda wished he had read a VO for the letter.
I seriously need to try that recipe.
I’m so pleased my two favorite historical channels are collaborating like this! I hope these kinds of videos can continue here and there! They’re so much fun to watch 💕
I've live in the states my whole life and never heard of Indian pudding
Am I the only one who wanted to know what was in the the jar, bottle, and bag? I thought they were the ingredients for the pudding.
So love the Devon accent!
6:05 a "Thank you" letter. Miss, send it through whatsapp
I have been waiting for this.  More to come, I hope?
NUTMEG!!!!
They just keep getting better and better 😍
Dear English Heritage:  What gave you the idea to do a food exchange and unboxing with the people at Townsends?
It's like an early day snack crate lol
Loveeeed this. Please do more collabs.
I love when she said it was too ugly then tried it...It's like when you eat something and tell everyone it's no good so you can have it all, lol.
This was a wonderful idea! Such fun. Good that Mrs Crocombe mentioned that there are some differences between European and US measurements, such as the size of a pint.
Why am I binge watching these lol
Don't forget the nutmeg! 😁
Cornmeal and blueberries today would be like breakfast cereal! LOL! I hope the cornmeal is freshly ground and non-GMO! Monsanto is doing nasty things with seeds these days. Nevertheless, it's a Biblical principle not to alter your seed, and use the finest of non-processed foods, so may I recommend raw honey instead of sugar, along with the maple syrup?
I am now a proud Hoosier
Most ambitious crossover of 2018
Love the vintage packaging. The world needs to go back to these instead of plastics
Roleplaying level 9001
I can't get enough of these videos!
I hope someone will make similar channel about Polish kitchen. It's wonderful history lesson ☺
Thanks!! Best colab around!!!
That would be good for breakfast, with plenty of butter along with the syrup
YES PLEASE! :D
this just makes my heart so happy!!!
It looks good, but I think I'm biased. After all I am American :D
Cornmeal Mush is delicious as well.
I’m watching these videos at 1:31 in the morning 😂 Greetings from America
YES YES YEEES FINALLY A VIDEO!!!! Yaaaaaaaay ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is so much fun!!! I absolutely love this!!
America and Great Britain forever ❤️
Best unboxing video ever ^^
I love this channel!
You can never go wrong with a little nutmeg
I absolutely love this!
Who looked up Bilberry and Whortleberry?
Being an Early American "history buff", and an American of English and Irish descent, I believe that the Townsends channel to be amongst the best on You Tube, and now the English Heritage channel as well. The collaboration is between the two makes it all the more exciting. A sincere thanks to both.
OMG a collab with Townsends, so unexpected! I guess I should've read the title of the video, but I didn't notice until she read the end of the letter.
I love this! do more crossovers!
4:02
I would have loved being in that era as the lady of the house
omg omg omg ogmmmfmg
Is she actually british like the actress sounds funky
Thought its gonna be a Big Mac or Whopper
This is so awesome! Townsend’s and English Heritage working together? Yes, yes, and yes.
Here from the Townsends!! How fun it was to see the other side of this!!
My two favorite people 😃
That's cool they collaborated on this
Wouldn't be Townsends without the Nutmeg lmao
The letter covered halfed of the video 😑
I’m not even British but I still love these videos👍😄
Oh wow, I was just watching one of his videos, switched over to yours, and here we have a crossover!
Oh missed her so much!
On the positive side, she just invented Play-Doh! Hahaha
TOP 10 ANIME CROSSOVER
Historic cooking cinematic universe.
This is just so lovely to watch. The way people before share their love for food.
They should put out a cookbook and a t-shirt... I would totally buy a Crocombe T-shirt - What Would Crocombe do?
This was neat! I love the ineraction between the two and hope this happens often.
I absolutely love Mrs Crocombe!
Mrs Crocombe! Kween! No one knows the way around a kitchen like you :)
Love this!!!
Omg I love this!!
Best crossover in the history of history!
We in our house enjoy both of your channels very much!
I ♥️ Mrs Crocombe. I'm looking forward to the Christmas videos (hint hint) hopefully there will be some. As an English person in Australia these videos provide a much needed dose of English-ness.
The beginning of the recipe is actually what my Caribbean family eat-the cornmeal with sugar butter milk and spices.It’s actually really good
I was hoping the package would contain a Big Mac, mozzarella sticks and a Krispy Kreme donut.  Hahaha!!
What are bluberries called in Devon? 04:02.
Very cool. Love watching both channels.
Don't forget the nutmeg.... Lol
Am I the only one who was expecting her to pull out a bottle of mushroom catsup from that box?  I love both of these channels!  :-)
Lmao the way she commented at the recipe
This is so strange and fascinating....
Don't worry, Mrs. Crocombe, that's pretty much how it's supposed to look! Grew up on this, and it's always delicious,  with whatever berries are available.
NEVER forget the Nutmeg!
i want to courtship this lady
I don’t think would understand how much I love this Channel I love it
The ultimate collab
I'm American, and hand to God, if she had opened the box and it was just full of Wendy's, I wouldn't have been surprised.
Awesomeness.thank you and subbed
Awesome! :) So lovely.
"Don't forget the Nutmeg' haha
Loved this soo much!
Love it keep making more videos everyday
I’ve never seen this series before and this came up as a recommended video and OMG 😍😍😍
She makes me happy . I love her videos
I love you!! 😍
♥♥♥ Love this collaboration!
What a lovely video. It's somehow very heartwarming. And the pudding looked delicious! <3
Best unboxing video on youtube
John Townsend and Mrs Crocombe collaberation? suprised it was'nt some kind of Nutmeg and Cucumber concoction :D
I'm glad to see that you allowed for a bit of a mistake in the execution, rather than trying over and over until it looked perfect. Gives it more humanity and seems more accurate to how a Victorian house cook would have tried an unfamiliar recipe.
I SEE CROWCOMBE.
I CLICK.
Now the pudding is cold, I could take it out of its mould.... Poetry at its finest
I would love to receive a box filled with goodies like that and a hand written note..So endearing and thoughtful..So much care went into that ..which is lacking in today society..Can we bring back those charming mannerisms..Effort went into that..I want that Box as a keep sakes..ha
Something warm and inviting about watching her open and take the things out of the box and the excitement of what are all these things that seem and look carefully hand done..Ah...Mood......
What i find interesting is when one sends a text one tend to misunderstand things said via text..But this simple 3-4 page letter is quite easy to get the feel of the writers intentions of sending her this box of gifts..
I love her she has such a dry wit ..too funny this gal..Love listening to her..and watching her bake and cook..That dessert looks really good..Yummy..
This is oddly satisfying
Wait... if Townsends is set in the 1700s primarily, and Mrs. Crocombe is a Victorian lady, then what kind of time-traveling magic postage are they using?!
Now i want to go back to the 1880s.  🚀
This collaboration was something I didn't realize I wanted so badly until I found it had happened. I would truly love to see more of this. Something of an American/Victorian food interaction or the sort. Fantastic.
This is so cute.
PS: We threw your tea in the harbor as it is tradition
That nutmeg grater is everything
I would love to see more collaborations
I love these little collab videos between you two.
I just wondered why Mrs Crocombe didn't use the word Receipt in stead of recipe? Since it was common  in 1895. I will ask Mr Townsend the same thing.
I loved this crossover!
It looked like oatmeal before it was cooked. And a rough apple brown Betty after it was cooked.
To the staff of English Heritage - A sincere thank you for the videos that look into a special time in our history. Even as an American I have enjoyed everything presented in the videos. Mrs. Crocombe must have been very special both in person and for the actor someone to play as. I enjoy the history, the food prep, and even the mannerism that these special actors present. To be blunt, we can benefit from some of those lessons in today society with courtesy and respect. I would be fascinated to see what our character Mrs Crocombe would have thought of the technology and development in food preparation and presentation today.
DON'T FORGET THE NUTMEG XD
I have enjoyed watching these back and forth videos (started with Townsends and then came here).  I hope you can work out another set.  These are so much fun!
I thought blueberries were called the same thing on both sides of the pond.
I saw mrs crocombe in the newspaper!
Townsend's this was a fun two part episode collaboration and gave us a very interesting look into this time period, thank you. Watching this got me to remembering the farm I grew up on in New York USA; up the rod from our farm was an apple orchard that had been growing since the Civil War, the apples grown their were a variety called Northern Spy's, which we understood had been sold and shipped to Queen Victoria in England during the late 1800's.
That letter was beautiful...
i think im in love 😍😍😚
The real Mrs. Crocombe would NOT have CUT the string, but would have opened the knot carefully and untied it, rolling the string up and saving it for future use. The same would be for the paper in which the package was wrapped. If not used to wrap something up it could always be utilized in the fireplaces, to start the blaze.
Mrs Crocombe & John Townsend in one video! What a treat! <3
That actually looks delicious. I was glad to see this came from Mr Townsend. Oh my it's making me hungry
They really write long letters during the early times.
I love Townsends, and I'm so glad to see this crossover.  Now to visit from one state over, and get back to the UK at some point.
love the collab  nice
OMGGGG I LOVE YOU GUYSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! YESSS IVE ALWAYS WANTED THEM TO DO A COLLAB!!!
What a lovely collaborations all in the spirit of the time.
Looks pretty good.  I do have to laugh at the letter though.  Back then, nobody (rich or not) would have ever thought to NOT use the back of a piece of paper and just write on one side!   I love these videos!
so....y'all f*ckin?
I really love your meals Mrs. Crocombe... Marry me.
Looks very delicious, as I am a big blueberry fan. I'd fancy custard with this dish.
Its RAW
Please send more - send to other period centric folks and expound at length!  Had such a day...but this was a good end
This looks so good
Every Townsend and son fan out there knows you had to put in that nutmeg! I was just waiting for it LOL
I love this series!!!!!!
I love them both 😍
Sweet polenta :D
Happy to See and Hear that your parcel came from Indiana. I’m from Indianapolis Indiana USA.
Love these videos
Do they really exist?? I started to believe so .. that parcel took almost 4 months to arrive .. Would not that food be rotten?
A delightful Monday surprise!
best colab!
This makes me so happy lol
Addicted to this series.
YES MS CROCROME MY QUEEN
Love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't get enough of Mrs Crocombe!!!!
The crossover we deserve
Mrs  Crocombe is a skinny legend
It probably tasted like treason
Quick question: how did you get such an  even cook on the pudding over a fire? Is there a secret to cooking delicate dishes over fire?
COLLABORATE ON ALL THE THINGS
omg her dainty little bite of that pudding. so gentle!
Her accent is 💜
Is that ludy who play nannie MacPhee? Sorry English not god
People who dislike this are idiots. I love this. People believe that Townsends are strictly 18th century but forget that they cover the 19th century as well. Love both historical channels.
Someone got her History Crate loot XD
maize  is actually called corn in some languages
Is the actress who plays Mrs Crocombe from Bristol? She has a slight West Country inflection.
Skipping that letter I see
Love this channel.
It looks so yummy tho 😍
This crossover collab is the best thing ever
i thought it looked nice mrs crocombe!
How lovely to see your channel and that of Mr. Townsend, trading courtesies, culture, and education for us across the electronic miles.
Her waist though x3
Awesome collaboration!
Lol i love your videos but i couldnt help thinking if year 1881 did they have rather modern looking scissors.
I thought she was getting invited to Super Smash Bros in that letter
And don't forget the nutmeg!
Thank you  for  sharing  this  recipe , Yesterday I  decided  to  try it myself . As  I use  cornmeal  regularly ,being gluten  intolerant, I found the  recipe very  suitable for my needs. 
I added the  spices   but realised I could  use any  spice I fancied. Next  time  I will use  lemon  juice and zest. with  apricots and  sultanas . I did  not  let the  maize cook  too long ,as Mrs Crocombe sugested and  it  turned out just  fine.  The  first cake I have ever baked  that did not sink in the middle . I will also  glaze the  next  cake with  lemon sugar (2oz sugar  disolved  in two  tablespoons of lemon juice) some  might  call this a lemon and apricot bread
most ambitious crossover of the last few centuries, tbh
1800's pen pals! 😄
So happyyyyyy these two grey channels collared!!  this is also adorable for some reason lmao
Ah, I love these videos!
If you are looking for a modern american version, search the term "Spoonbread". My hometown of Berea, KY has the festival every year and its really similar to this.
Love this series!!
Anyone else notice her nose moving up and down slightly while reading the note?
the most ambitious crossover event in history!
we stan a queen
I love this. It’s so much fun.
That pudding looks lovely! Sorta reminds me of klapertaart that we have in Indonesia
I love this lady!
This is the most downright charming thing I've ever seen.
This was so excellent, didn't know about the Townsends channel until this now I've subscribed to both and made both Poor Man's Rice Pudding, and Victorian Sandwiches! Such a good part of YouTube.
You have no idea how awesome I think this collaboration between two of my favorite  YouTube channels is !!
OMG my faves are crossing over
well i have been doing my family tree and i found i had family who lived in Bunker Hill in the 1800s died in 1844, so would that have been the type of food they would have eaten
Our queen has returned!
Love these videos ❤️
Mrs. Crocombe is an absolute delight. I finally got a chance to watch this. This series is so pleasant!
I wonder how this got through customs.
I love to see these 2 channels interact.
Like if you watched this in the 1800's.
can mrs. crocombe be my mom please
Mrs. Crocombe always makes my day!!! I can’t wait until I can afford to travel and see this beautiful home - maybe Mrs. C will invite me in her kitchen.  🙏🏽🙏🏽
So charming!
That pudding looks delicious!
What in the Downton Abby is this
Beautiful collaboration
Oh I didn't know the imperial pint was different from the US pint.
1891....The last decade of Victoria's reign.  Wonder what a Royal visit to Audley End would have been like.
The letter says United Slates
We love you ❤
wrong timeline
Jon Townsend? I wonder who that might be?
Most ambitious crossover event in history!
What a wonderful collaboration!
Is it a pâte à choux, like churros and eclairs?
YESSSS
I love this so much
Isn't this the second collaboration?
That looks delicious!!
She so bougie
wow we love a victorian collab
Yummy! 😋🍮
They said maize and not corn??
Bluebris
I'm from Indiana <3
These videos are terrific
I hope you do this again for Christmas
I think I’ll try this! So great 😀
As we all wait for the nutmeg to come out...
Wait we call blue berries differently in US and U.K.?
This was lovely!
I haven't watched this channel for a bit, but I had just watched him wrap this with his daughter and send it off!! So I click here and she's receiving this PKG from the townsends...and I'm like Wow! this is awesome...would have never guessed.
D: I didn't realize Townsend was in Indiana!! I might just have to make a visit soon!
I adore these videos!
Move videos like this, this one was really fun and different.
I 💗 HISTORY
I’m from Indiana!
Cheers
Time travel is real.
The nutmeg!
Ahhhhhhh, yes so excited!
5:46 she lost her manners jeez
Don't forget the nutmeg!!
Shes thicker than a bowl of puddin
Why is this so wonderful to watch????
Queen
👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤
damn mrs crocombe is fit as
❤️❤️❤️
Just wonderful
Hope there will be a joint collab, Townsend visit the estate and Mrs Crocombe go to visit them.
This was magical.
This mini collaboration series is the single most amazing thing I have in my life right now. I really enjoy it. Thank you, both Townsends and English Heritage for coordinating these. (The 7 year old in me is freaking out right now! I wish I could go back in time and share this with her).
I love her eye brows
WORLDS ARE COLLIDING!!
So, lore-wise, this is the 1700s Townsend's kid right?
poodin’
I love you women
mrs crocombe asmr pls
amaxing
AH YES!
I love her acting!
That dessert looks good
😍😍😍
I love Mrs Crocombe 😍
Don't be daft. At that time in history, both American and British measures were identical. Pints American were the same Pints the British used. Where do you think we got them?
I love these Videos!
I love these!
I love these crossover videos!
Who the heck disliked this???
I cannot believe they had such good cameras in the 1800’s!!

‘The Nature of a Pudding’ is going to be the title of my autobiography. This was an absolute delight to watch! I’d love to see similar exchanges with other countries, if possible!
Been with Townsends for a long time. Got my DNA back and I'm 80%  UK so I'll start brushing up here .
Girl i’m trying to not get triggered bc this American just said Maple Syrup is American kabsjvwjdjwa
This was so wholesome!
I heart her
When will Mrs Crocombe become Mrs Townsend? ? ?
Does anyone else notice @02:28 it says 'United Slates' instead of United States?! haha
This is so nice.
121 people shall be tarred and feathered post haste!!!
What a lovely collaboration. It is very interesting to see this recipe for Indian pudding. We still make it where I grew up (New England) but perhaps the recipe has changed over time or had variants—the ingredients and steps are similar, but we put molasses and/or maple syrup into the pot with the cornmeal and milk, and it is, essentially, a baked cornmeal custard... I imagine the texture may be like a moist steamed pudding, as it holds together but is rather soft. I would be interested to try this, and maybe to try adding blueberries to the Indian pudding I've made before.
She was shook at that good American pud pud
Where my Hoosiers at
So much fun! Thank you.
Keep these up there awesome.
I was hoping for grits but then I remembered "Indiana" and not likely to find grits. The Indian Pudding does sound tasty.
Coolest collab ever
How come we never see her employers?
I honestly thought it was going to be full of nothing but nutmeg!
Amazing !
Victorians had fake tan? Well i never!
Oh, it's from Hoosier-land! My neck of the woods! Yeah, corn is big here. Corn, cows, and soybeans. Apples, too, really.
Townsend's handwriting is better than mine.
Great video😊👍🏻
BEWWWBS
It's good to know that both English and American folks from the 17th century can communicate to each other without brandishing muskets and aiming cannons at each other (a historical joke, no need to be sensitive here)
I love this show
I'm from Indiana
I love thiss
Fantastic!  :)  I will admit the dish didn't look very appealing either, but I'm sure it tasted as wonderful as she said.
It's kind of like a blueberry muffin in cake form.
You can’t forget the nutmeg!
This is REAL Native Pudding
4 cups milk (whole or low fat) ¼ cup butter 2/3 cup molasses 3 tablespoons honey 3 tablespoons sugar 2/3 cup coarse yellow cornmeal 1 teaspoon vanilla ½ teaspoon salt ¾ teaspoon nutmeg ¼ teaspoon ginger ¼ teaspoon cloves ½ cup raisins (optional) 

Preheat oven to 350. In a medium saucepan, over medium high heat, 
warm 3 cups milk and the butter. Once melted, stir in the molasses, 
honey and sugar. Combine the cornmeal and spices, and gradually add to 
the warm milk mixture. Continue to cook while stirring for 10 minutes or
 until mixture thickens. Add raisins, if using.

Pour into a buttered 3-quart casserole dish, and pour the remaining 1
 cup milk on top. Do not stir. Bake in preheated oven for 1 ½ hours, or 
until set. Serve warm with ice cream, whipped cream or vanilla yogurt.
I just sub you. Congratulations
I really love these
It looks like a buckle
I miss handwritten letters. I'm only 25, but it's something my family still did in my childhood. Now it's text messages, emails and social media. No nice paper texture and smell with the persons own handwriting and little mistakes. I can't even remember how many years it's been since we've recieved or sent a postcard with holidays. I mean after all, why write people how your holiday is going when you can just take pictures and upload them to facebook right?
Love that these two channels collaborate! Townsends is local to me so its so cool to see this!
Wortleberries!
Anyone else watching this for the asmr factor?
cicadas - sick-cay-da :)
Love it
Well this was fun as always. I didn’t even think that the pudding would be up to snuff until Mrs. Crocombe declared it so. True it is not in the Victorian style at all but, she noted, it is very good.
my queen mrs crocombe
Thank you
Ye Olde Unboxing video
As a native Hoosier (a person from Indiana), I was excited to see that the letter came from Indiana! Why did you select Indiana?
suddenly my mouth is salivating when she said the pudding taste very good... oh goshhh, I just imagine to eat it with some dark tea or jasmine tea... yummm~


and also... WHO GIVE THE DISLIKES!!! come on people, we must prepare the pitchforks and shed tools and we must find the dislike witchess!!! 
Yay!
Love it!!
Love love love this! ☺☺☺☺
I love these little videos! Mrs Crocombe is my heroine. Not seen the Townsends so will have to check out their channel very soon to compare. ;)
A crossover with Townsends? Exciting!
Why don't these two channels have over a million subscribers ?!
you might want to correct the title! It says “The Victoria Way” rather than “The Victorian Way”
I love England
social history of victorian  cooking
Can I send her a Big Mac?
Are the Townsends time travellers? All their Recipes are from 18th century. Mrs, Crocombe lives in 19th C Victorian England. Beautiful video but confusing.
Wonderful
She looks like nanny McPhee
By the who?
😁😁😁
Its... Its... Like those days listening to stories...
Charming and entertaining show. I am from New England - Indian pudding is still a staple here. It should have molasses and have a deeper color as a result. And I have never had it with blueberries. Maybe it is different in the midwest
oh this lady is irish?  i never realized until she started reading
This is a very lovely video!  Modern Nutritional Science has revealed that maize/corn, while extremely versatile, contains mostly empty carbohydrate calories, and isn't the healthiest starch choice in place of say, 100% whole grain rye, quinoa, or flaxseed. It's not even recommended for livestock anymore, at least not exclusively in their diet.
Is this a crossover episode?
I was expecting a Big Mac and a diet coke
Interesting American recipe lol it just seems like sweet cornbread to me with blueberries—I’m an American and want to try this

New look for the crown :)

Well that’s one long letter!
Where are the recipes fir the plum cake and seed cake she had sent to America?
When did America become a country of its own? I  assumed that England and America were enemies, but I guess this is set way after independence when things had cooled down.  I support this channel nonetheless.
Mrs Crocombe's ancestors are clearly visible as anyone commenting on a food/recipe website. It called for ham, but I used chicken. Cornmeal, I used cornflour. Whiskey,  but I substituted Limoncello...
British:  "Hmm.  It doesn't look quite as good as I would have liked.  It certainly doesn't look good enough to go up to Lord Braybrooks' table."

American:  "Hmmm. It doesn't quite look as good as I would have liked.  Oh, well.  If they don't like it, they don't have to eat it." 

:o)
My grandmother was born in the late Victorian Era, and I lived with her growing up. Mrs. Crocombe reminds me of her - I definitely learned how to cook, clean, sew, write legibly using a fountain pen, have manners, respect people, etc. Thank you, grandma!
Looks   delicious  ! 👍👏
I so love both of these channels! How fun!!!
How many months did it came??
Wholesome content right here.
Great video
What's up with those blueberries? How did they not spoil?
I keep coming back to watch these videos because they are so wonderful. I can’t help but think that Townsends fans squealed when she added the nutmeg. (It’s a bit of a thing with Townsends followers...)
American food good for only British servants. XD.
Sweet corn puddings are still eaten in the states especially around holiday time. Keep in mind that American butters have a higher water content than European butters so you may need to add an extra tablespoon or so of liquid to get the right absorption ratio for better un-molding. You can also substitute half or all of the butter for olive oil which is a fool proof way to get the same effect as well as a richer flavor and a better moist crumb.
Lovely!
British girl tries American candy
Cornflour is not cornmeal! But Italian polenta and East African ugali are, so if you need to, substitute those.
I've been wondering about this for a while, what format is this show presenting in? Is she a self aware reenactment, in the 21st Century, acting in front of a camera crew? Or is she Mrs Crocombe in 18th Century Audley End House, presenting through a macguffin of time travel of somekind? Because the Townsend show incorporates modern day anachronisms, therefore setting itself as just a dress up show about the 1800s. But thus far English Heritage, to their impressive credit, has gone out of their way to avoid as much modern day influences as possible. At the same time, Mrs. Crocombe is still talking to thin air (from the perspective of the other 18th Century Audley End inhabitants), and conversing with an American YouTube show from 2018. LOL!
Came over, from the other side of the pond, from Townsend's channel.
Why are her finger nails always dirty?
Do Americans say maize? I thought they say corn.
Left all assignments, chores, put other videos on pause just to click on Mrs. Crocombe video.
Im early yeheyyyy
Honest question. Why did the english thought that maize is more suited as a food to animals??
24th
THE ONLY COLLAB THAT MATTERS.
where is the molasses?
Are there any Hoosiers watching this
I wonder, if Maize was considered for animals in English society, then wouldn't the dish Mrs. Crocombe made be unacceptable for Lord and Lady Braybrooke REGARDLESS of look or taste?
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT TOWNSEND!!!!!!! AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!! I HAVE MORE TO LOOK FORWARD TO NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In Massachusetts nowadays, Indian pudding is more of a liquid consistency with no blueberries and a lot of molasses, served with ice cream it’s delicious!
I make Indian pudding for Thanksgiving every year! My father is from New England and is rather fond of it.
Are there Cheetos in there?
These little films make you believe that the world is still a good place.
Cute!
i thought she was gonna get cheeseburger, nuggets, and fries.
Why does the letter is 1890 and her costume 1850's?
How very pleasant, I’m going to make that
Please do a collaboration with Ms Yeah, too! The queen of english kitchen and the queen of chinese office cooking would be the mash-up of the century! :D
Wait that’s not a hamburger
Indiana, whowho!
Why is it 1881
Why is everything always from "America"? Doesn't she ever receive any parcels from countries int  the British Empire? It's getting a wee bit stale. How about something from India, Canada, Australia, Sweden, France?
Oh wow! Crossover videos! Such a delight :D
THE BEST CROSSOVER!!
The queen of cooking is back 😘😍😍😍😍😍
Yeesss!! Mrs. Crocombe is back!! 😁❤
The ultimate collab!! Omg!!
At last thank you god!
New England Indian pudding is made with corn meal ,milk,eggs,molasses,cinnamon and all spice. Quite delish
For God's sake, woman. You're about a hundred years apart!
This may be a dumb questions, but English people don't have blueberries?!?!
Is this Play School? No way string would be cut. A waste. Ridiculous make up and script delivery.
I'm  from Boston Mass originally but I'm in fort wayne Indiana now!!! Indiana food  is  gross
Anyone else notice the date on the letter? Aug of 1881?
But where is cucumber ?
She has worn the same clothes in every video. 🙄
Very nice!
that looks like a cake.. the consistency look like a cake.. or am i wrong?? what's the difference between cake and pudding?? please enlighten me..
Finally! the collab I've been waiting for
None of this "Upstairs Downstairs" or "Downton Abbey" stuff, please.  Very Dickensian. I really don't care what those stuck up, pompous Victorians ate.
Nutmeg is nutty good
That Everybody wants
Eat too much you’ll get sick
Nutmeg can make you nuts
Maple syrup is canadian. But k. Lol
Finallllllly!!! 😩😩😩😫
Yay!
Oh look, I got a American box to. Lets see what I got.
4 xl Cheese burgers, a xl bottle  of whiskey, 40 ounce of 1000% moonshine, 1 cheaply make apple pie, a shotgun and a golden laced American flag framed in gold next to a picture of George Washington... in gold.
Wtf she spend little more than 4 minutes talking instead of cooking. Uhg
MAPLE SYRUP IS CANADIAN NOT AMERICAN!!!!!!!
While historical, Indians is still a really unsettling term to hear in reference to Indigenous people
3:39 it CRACKED me up when Mr. Crocombe says that British eggs are larger than American eggs... the Superiority
Log cabin?????  Who the heck was building a log cabin in Indiana in the 1880's? Indiana had been a state since 1815. It hadn't been on the edge of the frontier for decades. It was part of the civilized East by then and had had mill-cut wood and city-made bricks for ages. Indianapolis, its main city, was third behind Chicago and Cincinnati in the pork-packing industry by then and the city boasted the second-largest railroad hub in the States. Even the very smallest of small towns found anywhere across the Midwestern US in 1880, could boast to having many a clapboard-sided home (that would not be too different than those built today) standing alongside many stone or brick public buildings. This letter might be based on real events, but it does seem very strange.
Well, I was expecting tea from the British East India Company with a light flavor of the Boston Harbor.  But stolen Indian stuff would be just as American.
maybe try the 4 eggs as suggested and not 3 cuntface!
I wonder what the real Mrs. Crocombe would have thought about her becoming internet famous over a century in the future.
"If the apples are too far off, then we give them to the pigs."
NEXT UP ON ENGLISH HERITAGE: 

"Oh, hello! I didn't see you there. My name is Grunty. I'm the second  upstairs pig here at Audley End..."
Edgar must be protected at all costs
Can you make an episode of Mrs,Crocombe’s day off. What would she have most likely done on a day off and how would she have dressed
Honestly? I'd love to see an Audley End show on Netflix with several different segments like these per episodes. Its so calming and relaxing, yet fun and educational!
He is adorable. I’m loving this educational aspect of the housekeepers

Roses and winter preparations in the garden please
What a charming young lad. And, of course, showing proper respect for Mrs. Crocombe. Very good. Very good, indeed. Carry on!
"Picked them myself Mrs. Crocombe." The look she gives him, she is so unimpressed by that! lol
Dear Mr. Ashman, 

I hope this note finds you well. Out of curiosity, besides apples, what other fruits and vegetables are grown at Audley End? 

Thoughtfully Yours, 
Ms. Lovely
On the next episode of English Heritage:
Mrs. Crocombe: hello :) the gardener has just sent me this basket of apples fresh from the garden, I’m going to make Gateau de Pomme for Lady Braybrooke who would like to have a sweet treat for the season, to make this, you will need...
Dear Mr. Ashman. I wonder what herbs you keep in the garden at Audley End, and for what purposes? 

Sincerely,
Janni Stensgaard
I didn't think I could love anyone  more than Mrs. Crocombe, but Mr. Ashman has such a charming and warm vibe. I can't wait to see more of him
♡ Much love from Texas♡
Aaaand after Mrs. Crocombe, I just became a fan of Edgar the gardener!
I'm curious about the apples seen growing on limbs trained like grape vines. Is this a common practice in English gardens? In America, fruit picking usually involves the use of tall ladders, these 'trained' apple trees seem like they are easier to maintain and harvest.
On the next episode: How to make garters out of guts.   :)
It would be lovely to see elderflower harvesting and cordial making as a combined garden and kitchen tutorial!
I'm so thrilled! I grew up in a hundred year old orchard as a child. While our orcharding techniques were very different it is so neat to be in a working Garden again. I love these new characters. I can't wait to see more. And of course we'll have to wait and see what all those wonderful apples become! We used to make a huge batch of cider. In an old fashioned cider press from the 1920s. I wonder -- would something similar be done here? Were cidar applies kept along side eating apples?
Show us the difference between how the rich and the servants eat, and how one kitchen can make both.
I'd like this handsome lad to pick my apples😋
So lovely! Now I'm waiting for Mrs Crocombe's Gateau de pomme!! 😍
I would love to see a series about gardening about the grounds.

Love this new expansion to this Victorian series universe.

I’d love to see videos about roses, herbs, or trees (specifically, pruning/training techniques, such as the espalier technique to grow the apple trees like grape vineyards)
A ten minute video?!?! Christmas has come early! I love Mrs. Crocombe 😊
After this, all English words I'll be reading will sound British in my head. 😂
The "Third Gardener" is so adorable, polite, and hard-working! Mrs. Crocombe should be nicer to him. Also, what if he starts to have an innocent (but sincere and appropriate) romance with the kitchen maid? They look so cute together. And she could be nicer to him, too! But I know they had to toe the line in those days. As for what I'd like to learn, perhaps you could teach us about the herbs that were grown in gardens of this time and place, along with how they were used in the kitchen. Secondly, you could do a series of "Gardening & Cooking through the Seasons," and show us how what was available seasonally in the garden had an impact on what could be done in the kitchen. Finally, HERE IS A VOTE FOR MRS. CROCOMBE'S DAY OFF!
20-something people clicking thumb down are INSANE. This is the best thing I've ever seen in September. THE VICTORIAN WAY UNIVERSE!!!!
I loved seeing all the characters interact and seeing how they act towards one another on the job!
Please do more of this, it was great!
This is so British. But also charming. How about literal cherry picking? I am actually curious to know now
Edit: or something seasonal would be more appropriate like turnips or pumpkins
Dear Mr. Ashman,

I do so appreciate you taking the time out of your very busy day to teach me more about apple harvesting! I sure learned a lot. If it's not too much trouble, and if Mr. Vert approves, perhaps some time soon we could learn about late fall harvesting, and how the gardeners such as yourself prepare the garden for winter? Oh, or perhaps what a typical day for you is like? I look forward to hearing from you. 

Cordially yours,
(Ms.) Rico


--
It's awesome to see others from the house! I love that the cast is growing. I look forward to these videos so much.
I'm curious about the types of flowers you all grow and the differences of how to use them, so edible flowers vs dinner table flowers vs those for special guests or celebrations
I feel like I'm watching a training video for a job position. lmao
I like Mr. Ashman. I'd like to see how the garden gets ready for winter. Also, I'd like to see the recipe Mrs. Crocombe was making from the apples.
Downton Abbey
Drama! Intrigue! Adult themes!
Audley End
Roly poly pudding and apple harvesting.........
Audley End, you've won my heart 😋😋😋💝
With their royal English accent, this show should be a regular series like Downton Abbey. 😍😍👏👍🏻
Literally every vegetable and fruit you could grow, please. Pumpkins and other sqaush would be good for this autumn, and obviously others next spring/fall. I'd also love to know what they would grow and eat during winter months. In the spring, it would be really nice to know how they tended all the flowers, and even the topiaries. Thanks for making this video! I really loved it.
This was wonderful! That garden looks like the one Peter Rabbit is living in. I wonder if there are any little bunnies stealing vegetables ^^ .
Btw, I have to say, for a gardener Edgar  is very neat and tidy. Also has lovely blue eyes <3 !
Wow he’s great, a natural on camera! Would definitely like to see more of him in future episodes!
Such a charming down to earth guy! Gonna love this new series too just like Mrs Crocombe's
So the Head Gardner is Mr. Vert?   or Mr. Green?  Ha.
"How To Pick Apples" Published on September 24, 1889
Please  Would you start another series base on gardening? This video is so inspired...
Oh this is such fun !
Would gardens for an estate of this kind had kept a hive of bees, or would they have bought their honey and relied on whatever pollinators were drifting through?
People keep saying that Mrs. Crocombe was a bit mean. If anything the kitchen maid was  the mean one. Mrs. Crocombe's just straightforward and short of being blunt.

And Mr. Vert and Mr. Ashmond are so nice! I love seeing this interaction.
This was so great.  I always have to stop and watch a new one.  A glimpse of Mrs. Crocombe and I assume that we'll get to see that gateau de pomme?? Hmmmm  What's a "boffey" dinner?  Good show with the new characters.  I want to see the glass houses.
This is so delightfully charming! Hope to see more episodes just like this one. I think I can even harvest my apples with ease now. Excellent, can't wait for the next one. What about pumkins?
Am still waiting to see the butler going about his day preparing stuff for Lord Braybrook.
Gateau de pomme!
Edgar: ???
He is just adorable and so charming!! I loved this video,can’t wait to see the next one. ❤️😊
NEW Episode! NEW person! this is excellent as always💕 Mr. Ashman is really charming and has such a warm vibes! I'm getting to love this series more & more
I would love to know how you trained the apples on the trellises and how accessible this is to the home gardener?
Can u EH pls do a series about who lady braybrooke, the owner of the house is??:>>>. I would be very glad to know
I'm portuguese and I just love to watch The Victorian Way videos! I find them very interesting and charming!
Ughh that opening shot... and then the background music... it touches something right in my heart, so warming, so sweet... I truly wish I could live in these videos. Love you English Heritage❤️
I do rarely post comments in Youtube. But when I saw another Mrs. Crocombe appearance, my excitement went high again! Though she has relatively short part in this video, I'm still delighted to learn new things about Victorian gastronomy. If I can influence the whole world to watch Mrs. Crocombe episodes, I'll do that with great honor.
He’s so adorable.
I'd also love to see the cherry picking, any type of bean harvest and cucumber harvest and then see how Mrs Crocombe pickles them.  =)
You're doing a great job, Edgar! Don't let anyone tell you different ;)
NEW CHARACTERS! YES!
Mr. Ashman, will you tell us about the Audley End roses?
Respectfully,
Mrs. Morgan, Manchester upon Ohio.
Amazing new characters! Great format! Great cinematography! Great everything!
The educational terms, the skitz and acting, the charming actors/actresses, I just love it.
I love that they're interacting with the viewer. This is a type of show I would watch. Seriously, I'd love to see episodes about the Audley End, and the characters interacting with the viewer as if they were to teach us, and with other characters that have potential developement.
Wow that’s a very handsome gardener. Anyway, MORE OF MRS CROCOMBE COOKING PLEASE
Gâteau de pommes? Reminds me of apple and maple cake we make here in Canada... I sure hope the recipe is delicious.

As for gardening, I'd love to learn more about planting a vegetable garden. I am also curious about long term storage for winter.

Best regards!
I absolutely loved this!!  As a person in agriculture this was wonderful to learn old techniques for the apple harvest. I can see that  much of the old techniques practiced ares still used today by home gardeners but have been long forgotten by large scale production. I would love to see the “glass houses” and learn about old methods of dealing with pests and diseases. Thanks for adding another character to this series!
brilliant idea put "heritage" in this way!!!!   I love watch this!!   big pleasure!!! with whole series... thanks
What a lovely insight into your gardens! Fantastic idea, from garden to table :-)
Hurray, more Mrs Crocombe! Thank you so much English Heritage and to all who are a part of the team putting these delightful videos together for us. :)
God I love him already. Thank you for this gift of a series, English Heritage.
I also love the acting . I feel like there talking to me & im right there
Mr.Ashman, You asked to let you know what else we might like to learn about, I would like to know more about watercress,how to grow, when to pick and so on. Furthermore I'd like to see those storage sheds and how the produce is stored.  Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Mrs J. Taylor of the U.S.A.
Add a few more characters and they’ll have their own version of Downton Abbey! 😃
I definitely hope to see more of Edgar. This was wonderful.
I do love the Victorian way all the people are just lovely the food and gardens so interesting. 

I would love more on the flowers.  Was there a lot of annual or was it mainly perennials.  

Thanks
Oh, he's a cutie, too. Can we get a garden boy/kitchen maid romance going on here? :) I'd watch it.
Wonderful! Mr. Ashman you are sweet and charming and sincere and i am looking forward to your next video!
Today we heard about aspirations of the third gardener to be head gardener. I would like to hear a bit about the duties of the first and second gardeners as well. ❤🌅🌵
I'd like to hear more about food storage and preservation methods, including fermentation, smoking and salting. 💜🌞🌵
What a charming young man....and so eager to both learn and teach.  Great addition to the staff at the house...
This feels like a live-action RPG tutorial. It’s so charming!
Such a fine specimen of English gentlemantry!  I rather enjoy you, and your lessons.
Oh my lord, Edgar is the best! Great voice, handsome lad, immediately loveable. The other lord had a ravishing accent :) Loved this video, interesting and fun as usual, thanks e.h. !
flowers, roses maybe? would love to know how does the English took care of them :)
Edgar you were delightful, (and you're such a wonderful actor!) And I cannot wait to see more of what you do in the gardens! I would like to know how you start new plants in the gardens. I have a bit of a black thumb myself. 
With love, Elizabeth of Long Beach California
Squash or root vegetables would be a lovely episode.
Also, he's a sweetie- and a keeper!
These videos are so charming they make me weep! Someone needs to turn this into a full fledged TV mini series,  about the staff at Audley End... Humour, romance, cooking and gardening all the Victorian way! 
Thank you for this
Can you please do an episode about harvesting and/or cooking with rare and unusual fruits and vegetables, like medlars and quinces? I love this channel.
This is what Youtube & people needs more of ! So pure . Like taking youtube literally back in time⏰ BEST thing on YouTube !!! Please dont stop w/ vids ever 💜💜💜💜
This was so charming! 
I would love to know more about growing/harvesting vegetables like cabbage and carrots etc.
This is so lovely!! Would love to hear about the flower garden and picking flowers for the house!!
Absolutely love this series! Nice to see a new face. Looking forward to more as always.
Mrs Crocombe: "They'll be perfect for my Gateau de Pomme."
Edgar: Squints
Fantastic series! I would love to see seasonal harvesting as we move into different seasons. And yes, he is adorable! Well done English Heritage!
I would like to know how you handle and tend to possible herbs and spices in the garden, or how the green houses are tended to.
Amazing video! Did Victorian household gardens ever include food crops from the colonies? If so, what was the learning process like to try and grow entirely new plant varieties? Was there ever ill effect with the other plants in the garden or the wildlife?
This was really interesting to watch. Sweet young man.
Will we see Mrs Crocombe make Gateau de Pomme then, please? :)
Also: What would they have done with the huuuuuuuuuuuuuge Rosemary plants, or are they new?
Wonderful episode! Mr. Ashman, you did a fine job. I cannot wait to see more of the gardens. A good episode would be a typical day for the third gardener.
Love it and love to see more of this series! Mr. Vert, gardener and mrs. Crocombe!
I LOVE the new video! I would enjoy videos on Victorian rose gardens and herbal or medicinal gardens.
Holy moly y’all took my suggestion!!!! I’m so happy too, because this is a real delight. ❤️
They'll have his guts for garters just for bruised apples? Jeez tough crowd...
Mrs crocombe know the way to go she make great teamwork with everyone and she is lovely 😊
Please more of edgar. 
He has that warm and inviting voice 😊
I really liked the new characters and loved seeing them interacting with our familiar cook staff!
Love these videos keep them coming. :)

Can we see a video on roses please. 🌹
I would love to see a gardening/ cooking episode all about herbs 🌿
More of this charming young lad please 😁😁
Dear Mr. Ashman, could you explain the best way to grow and harvest common vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic etc.
Respectfully, 
Miss. Pond, County of York.
I loved this tutorial. I'd love to see more harvesting and cooking tutorials
“They’ll have my guts for garters!” My mum always used to say that when I was a kid! 😝😄
I'm so excited for this new series!
Amazing production as always! Mr. Ashman is very charming.
I'd like to hear more about the garden competitions and how our house did in those competitions. Maybe even tell about livestock competitions. ❤🌅🌵
This is so charming! <3 What a lovely addition to the series.
I would love to see how the apple trees are pruned! They are so small and close together, yet have so many fruits :)
I really enjoyed this video 
I would so much love to see more videos on more gardening tips 💗
Totally agree with everyone here. Edgar is absolutely adorable and charming! My favorite part was when Mrs. Crocombe tells him about Gateau de Pomme and he has this puzzled look on his face. It's so cute!! I hope we get to see more of him again soon!!
I would love to learn how the espalier fruit trees are trained to their shape and then kept that way.
Mr. Ashman is so charming, he won my heart just the very first time, just like how Mrs. Crocombe did
Can this be a wholesome Netflix show, because watching the English Heritage Audley End videos makes me so happy.
Medicinal plants
Pest control
Other plants grown for purposes other than eating
This was...delightful. I enjoyed Edgar very much! More of him, Mr. Vert, and Mrs. Crocombe!
I would like to see the storage process . Thank's for all the great vid's
Edgar is so charming!  I hope to see much more from him, I could listen to him talk about gardening for hours.  I'm so pleased by everything that comes from Audley End!  It's really delightful to watch these characters interact, as well.  I always learn so much from these episodes and enjoy them immensely.

How about an episode like, "Preparing a garden for winter, the Victorian Way"?
Edgar, perhaps in another episode you could show us the vegetable gardens that keep the kitchens running. I'm very interested in seeing where so much of the food is grown at Audley End house. Thank you for showing us your apple harvesting.
He is so sweet and adorable! I look forward to watching more episodes
Very impressed by the decorum of the staff.  And the respectful, professional attitude toward their work irregardless of their rank or position.
OMG Edgar is too cute!!!! 

How do you keep pests away?
Oh we wish we could smell her cooking Edgar! 

Oh I just love these videos. Mrs. Crocombe is my favorite of course but I just love meeting the other workers at the house!

Edit:

Mr. Ashman, I would be so absolutely delighted to learn more about flower gardens if you help keep those at Audley End as well. I would also be positively chuffed to learn more about the harvest of other fruits and veg at Audley End. Keep up the hard work, you are doing great!

Sincerely, Sydney
Such a sweet boy..😍
I enjoyed Edgar Ashman's company, a charming gentleman. Can't wait to see him in future videos!
I just loved seeing the other characters.  I would like to see the herb gardens and some of the flowers, perhaps the roses as Mrs. Morgan so kindly requested.
Love this series ! Beautifully done with authenticity in tact and educational! Excellent cast and realistically portrayed characters.
Wow Edgar is super attractive 😍
awww... look at his face when he gave the apples to Mrs Crocombe   ❤️✨ !!
I just adore this entire series, and this lad has some stunningly beautiful eyes. Thanks as always for creating this lovely content!
Anyone who enjoys these videos will ADORE watching Downton Abbey 10/10 recommend
He is so cute and charming, love to see more of him :D
Am I the only person who when they say, "Hello there", waves frantically at the screen like a total loonie because I can't contain my excitement?
I'm not even being sarcastic. I'm WAY too into my history.
Are we ever going to meet Lord and Lady Braybrooke? I certainly hope their nice people. XD
This is absolutely perfect! I'd love to see more interaction with other members of the staff. The maids! How did they set a fire in the family's bedrooms without waking them? The laundress! As for gardening, this is most likely out of season, and I'm sure you have it planned anyway, but I'd love to see care for roses!
I love this new approach! So immersive! I want to know the lives and tasks of all the staff at Audley End. And I also love seeing the characters interact! 
Educational and so enjoyable.
Loving this new addition to the Audley End Cinematic Universe.
Yay! New characters! Love what you guys do! Mrs. Crocombe is wonderful! Thank you!
When 3rd gardener dresses better than majority of well-off men...
I'd like to hear a general overview of what was grown for the kitchens and if any produce was grown just for staff or just for the family. With love ❤ from sunny 🌅 Arizona USA 🌵
Omg I'm discovering this video after the one about the gâteau de pomme of Mrs Crocombe... The Audley End House Cinematic Universe is just insane.
Mr Ashman, 
I would like to see what vegetables are growing in the greenhouses.
Thankfully, Ms Mamat from Lauta in Germany
This young gardener Edgar making quite good job I might say.
 I would love to see how to prepare this big garden to winter, specialy flowers,  which do not like cold weather. For exaple roses. It is really large task, but is current, isn't it?
Loved this! Any additional gardening videos would be amazing!
i want more of Edgar soon !
and mister Vert
This was really charming and educational. I love it! 


It also made me hungry.
I'm so in love with these videos 😆. I'm going to need Netflix or Hulu to jump on these ASAP. I could do with a new old Britian based series 😊🤣😅
The blonde guy on the thumbnail made me clicked this even faster than normal. 💙😘
What a sweet young man!  Hope we see more of him!
Amazing looking espalier apple trees.  Would love to see techniques for pruning and training them. Love the series!
You, Edgar, are very good at your job, and quite handsome, too. Thank you for the lesson!
I would love training in edible flowers and bee keeping. Lovely to meet you, Edgar!
Id like to see an episode on asparagus!  That was a beautiful patch of asparagus fronds!  Peaches would be cool too!
Dear people of Audley End,

Your video’s are truly amazing and I watch them with great joy. I’d also really like to see a bit about the other people and employees at Audley End, for example the maids or butlers. I hope to see more of Mrs. Crocombe and the others! 

Sincerely,
Miss. Gray.
EXCELLENT, as always! Or even better,- thanks to this new person. Charming young man!
The next video I need is How to throw shade
The Victorian Way
Please elaborate on Victorian methods of growing/harvesting strawberries, raspberries and black berries. Thank you.
This was a delightful installment.  I would love to see flower picking/floral arranging.
More dessert recipes please!!  
We simply adore your channel 👏👏👏
Oh, how neat! Welcome, Edgar! Your blue eye colour is quite unusual, as are your gardening skills, I am sure! :-)
I ship him and Sylvia together
Thankyou for your wisdom young Mr Ashman. My apple tree has bitter rot this year, can I still use them for apple cider or am I asking for trouble?
What a puff! I love the cooking show and a garden show sounds amazing! I would love to see more of Edgar’s adventures. Perhaps a video on caring for roses or making a flowerbed? I noticed Audley has some lovely ones.
I am so eager to know more about the war between the gardeners and the cook. And about the wonderful garden! Oh my God, I am totally in love with the staff, please much more episodes! 😍
You did a great job! We're all rooting for you :)
Dear Mr. Ashman

Could you please show us how to keep and tend to a winter garden? I love this concept and will happily follow your future career.

Hope this finds you well and best regards.
  Mikaela
I would love to see the greenhouses! I am fascinated by them! Also the larder and storage themselves! Cheers!
An episode showing the process of pruning & training the fruit trees in an espalier would be interesting.  More Edgar please!
Oh my goodness!! I didn’t think these videos could get any better or cuter! Love this series and I can’t wait to see more!
Love this channel
Absolutely fabulous Mr Ashman looks like Mrs Crocombe has some competition :)
I love these videos so very much.
Such a delightful lad. Loving the series. Great job!
Lovely, and informative, video! Really enjoyed it! 

I would like to see how they did landscaping-pruning trees, bushes, grounds, planting etc-in the Victorian Era.
Dear Mr. Ashman,

You mentioned that there are award competitions for best fruits and veg? Can you tell us more about how they are judged (size, color, taste)? 
Also, what are the benefits/advantages for a gardener who wins awards? Why would the Lord or Lady be invested in winning, is it purely for bragging rights? 

Kindly,
Sandra
Edgar is precious! Thanks for sharing :)
English Heritage uploads-
IM HERE
im all for this new character
is there enough sources to make him a regular, throughout the seasons?
Dear Mr. Ashman,

The weather is simply lovely this time of year, spring has just begun. What is currently growing in the garden? I am interested to know if you have any favourite dishes that Mrs. Crocombe cooks with the first ingredients of springtime?
Regards,

Charlie
You’re cute and polite ! I’d love to work with you as helper... do you have the roses 🌹 garden as well? Would love to see how do you harvesting them
Mr. Ashman, 

I am curious to see your cellar/preservation room and what can be stored there, as well as the features of the room. 
I'm not sure I can reproduce it in my clime, but would be interest in trying! 

Cordially, 

Melanie Hobby
the accent and Edgar's blue eyes 💙🌹
I’d like to see an episode of a traditional kitchen herb garden!  Keep up the good work, I love these videos!
AWESOME :) i've just been to Audley end House at the beginning of September. I love those apple trees!
Things I learned from this video.
Victorians hate servants
Victorians hate pigs 
And Victorians HATE wasps
Also would be fantastic to see a video on the roses and other flowers grown at Audley End. Thank you!
How lovely! Mr. Ashman, would you be kind enough to share your knowledge of the garden's herbs? Surely Audley End grows its own for Mrs. Crocombe's delicious dishes, and I would very much like to know more about how best to get the freshest and most flavourful herbs. All the best ^_^
Dear Mr. Ashman,

Do you grow any tea trees, and if so how do you harvest the leaves for tea making. Also, do the gardens have any fountains or fish ponds? How do you take care of them
I never clicked so fast!! ANOTHER MRS. CROCOMBE VIDEO, YAYYY!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Love it!!!💗💗💗💗❤️❤️❤️❤️...

The Garden and as well writing in his journal!!! Note taking is Totally Awesome!!! Love the kitchen! I love to cook also!!!!
Dearest Edgar,

I am delighted to see how well on you are fairing at your new home. Please let us know if Mr. Verts is allowing you to grow anything from seed, or if you've been allowed to dabble in this strange selective genetic crop creations. Have you created any new plants that we can look forward to? 
Keep healthy.

-A friendly admirer
More about all the flowers in Audley End! Thank you!
Hello all — I am very interested in pruning trees and bushes and how to select the branches to prune and why... I’d love to hear your techniques on it. Agriculture and growing plants is not something I’m good at but I do enjoy it very much. Thanks for these great videos ! //Garrett
Loved it! yes please..do more :)
Love this series!! The actors are really lovely, and the filming and location is gorgeous. Its the perfect way to teach history! :)
Very different from when I picked apples for a living - much more care was taken by Edgar.  I learned quite a bit so thank you all, and I look forward to seeing more of Edgar soon.
"And we don't want any blemishes either, not unless we know they're going for the servents' pies." 


Omg y'all that shade
I would love to know how to grow asparagus and artichokes
Now I'm quiet curious on how are lady's maid and head housemaid days would be as well as housekeeper and butler.
Good day English Heritage...
   I begin with my eyes loving the ariel views of the landscaping..Miss Doris V. Collins always said there isnt anything like a British garden.. I agree i"ve seen her then garden..rest in heaven Dori🍃🍂... 🍎 Apples.. Thank you Edgar for the education.. Apple marmalade sounds delicious..😋.. Edgar how to keep my lawns edges/ uniformed..please and thank you Sincerely Tanja
I wish to help this young lad with those apples...And after that I need some Gateaux dès pommes😂 I hope we'll see the recipe!
Anybody else good the pun of a gardener named "Mr. VERT?"🤣
Very informative for someone like me. I live in a major city and have only ever seen crab apple trees. Also he has the most beautiful blue eyes i have ever seen.
Great video! I'd love to see what they have growing in the glass houses at Audley End.
This guy is just delightful. More videos from him please!
Oh my god! They're showing the whole damn crew! 😭😭😭😭 YASSSSS
Good Day to You Mr. Ashman, I enjoyed the visit and watching you pick apples for Mrs. Crocombe very much. You are in such a Excellent Position, as you so rightfully pointed out, to advance your education and be able to advance in your career eventually, all tho, Head Gardener? it might be quite a number of years before that position is available and watching you rise in the ranks will be a rare treat indeed. 

I'm in the warm climate of California, in the United States and our preparations for the seasons, what little we have, are quite different from in your Country and the lovely Estate you work in.  It would be quite beneficial to see some of the preparations for winter on the Estate and how fruits and vegetable are stored to over winter.  I for one and I'm sure many other guests here would love to see recipes/receipts from the very talented Mrs. Colcombe now and then, if it would not be too much trouble, from such a busy lady. Best Wishes, T. Kuntz
I loved this! Let’s learn about currant and/or gooseberry - my gran used to grow them ❤️
Can we stop following this guy into his room now? 😂
But on a serious note he's a great actor!
I very much enjoyed this episode! 
How you keep taking care of all these kinds of flowers?
I wish I could try those apples! 😭
I just subscribed because of Edgar.   And now I am enjoying the past clips   Brilliant
This was delightful! I loved seeing the different groups interacting! And of course I am looking forward to the gateau recipe. More please!
Omg I LOVE HIM! I did not know there were even that many variety of apples!
I have insomnia and these Audley End videos help l lull me to sleep.

Pumpkin harvest for fall! And maybe a good pumpkin pie recipe
 I'd like to make one this year. Last year, I followed Mrs Crocombe's gingerbread cookies and they were a smash hit with everyone who had them!

I second all the votes below for episodes chronicling the butler, and some about the roses too! Both great ideas!
I would like to welcome young Mr. Edgar to the staff! I would like to see Edgar cover the following garden tasks and subjects:

1. Establishing the espalier apples and pears. 

2. Pruning the espaliers.

3. Documenting all the fruit species in the garden, and I would love to see all the varieties listed as well, though I expect that will be possible a video. 

4. I want to see more of the flowers grown in the gardens and how specifically they are used. 

5. Are any medicinal herbs grown, and how were they used? 

6. I would like to see more specifics on how the apples were stored. Were they in the trugs, on shelves, or in crates? Were the apples insulated from each other by a barrier or did they just rest against each other. 

7. Please show the vegetable gardens!

8. I would like to know more about the third gardener position and what it entailed. 

9. I am assuming that you have Edgar's diary and I would like to know more about it and how it was found.
herbs, please :) I have once seen a victorian herb garden and it was charming!
New characters!!! Yay!!! This series just keeps getting better. ❤️❤️❤️
Omg his blue eyes! Feels like im drowning in the ocean
"They'll have my guts for garters!"
I'll have to borrow that someday.
This is great! :)  Love these charming lessons.
What are you doing this evening?

...binging Audley End videos, obviously.
These are riveting
Sassy side of Mrs Crocombe 😆😆😆
He’s adorable! We need more episodes with him.
Omg Yasss!! We need to see more of this!!!
YES YES YES!!! that intro music!!! LOVE-IT
Would love to learn more about gardening techniques!
Very interesting.  How were vegetable gardens prepared for seeding and then after harvest?  When were seedlings started and what was the preferred method?  Thank you for this lovely series!
I am curious Mr. Ashman and Mr. Vert, on how the Apple trees are grown on those trellises? 
We are used to tall trees here.
Please make more horse related videos with the groom John Barker, he was lovely! <3 
I would also love to see a video about the flowers in the gardens at Audley End. Edgar did such a good job telling us about the apples!
"They'll have my guts for garters". 6:00 What a joy this series is! Thank you English Heritage.
Some techniques for decorative flowers would be nice
love it, as always. ❤️ more like this please, more characters. and then, maybe a story, about romance during those days, anything really. then a whole series with mrs. crocombe, the gardeners, maids, the lords and ladies. 🤗
The editable flowers from Mrs. Crocombe's trifle please! <3 I would love to learn about how you grow flowers for food.
I'm hungry for apples now
Very informative and Edgar is a welcome addition to the series.
I absolutely adore British heritage. I’ve always wanted to dress as though I were in the Victorian Era or even experience it for a day.
This job would give me pure anxiety, so much pressure!
Thank you so much..I love watching these.
Good luck, Edgar!
My question is... how to grow Lavander, they keep dying on me, I must be doing something wrong, and the neighborhood cats keep slashing them (no respect) *sighs
I enjoy these clips probably more than I should. Hello from the Netherlands 2:23am
Che belli i vostri video!!!
How beautiful your videos are.......
Greetings from Italy 👋💙
More of the gardens and the adorable gardener please. 😍😍😍
Oh wow... Edgar is a gardener. He's also a keeper!
I would like to know methods of pest control (insect, fungal, etc)  in the orchards and gardens at this time.  Thank you.
i want to see mrs crocombe do a travel vlog! just a random thought. Or maybe a mrs. crocombe reacts to gordon ramsay. lol
Traveling to The 19th century with this lovely show.Greetings from Colombia
I loved the part where they said that the imperfect apples would be good for the servants.  Haha!
That Mr. Vert reminds me of Peter Ginn, archeologist from the farm shows.  Wonderful video.  I would love to see a whole series on the staff at Audley End House.
I lived in England for a while, my neighbor had a huge apple tree that extended a bit to my garden. Every time gales happen I get excited because I know there will be some wind fall apples. I'd collect any good ones and it was with no doubt the most delicious, crispest and sweetest apples I've ever had.
Edgar's so cute aw
I LOVE THIS NEW CHARACTER SO MUUUUUUCH
This, like so many other of these videos, make me want to watch a 3 hour movie about life back then in this house 💕
Speaking as someone who has been going to Audley End since 1977 and loving this series,  can we have more Mrs Crocombe, the butler, the ladies maid, parlour maid, betweens, footmen,  grooms, valet please
Mr. Ashman,

I'd like to know a bit more about the day-to-day of a gardener, and how you lot get your flowers so pretty! I'm a bit of a failure when it comes to horticulture, so perhaps you could teach me something. I would also love dearly to know that you got my note as well.

Sincerely,
Miss Renata Palmer,
from Wisconsin USA
It's nice to see the other workers that make up Audley End. It's fascinating how information they wrote a century ago can still be appreciated today.
Yes, I'm very interested in gardening... can't wait to hear more.
This was quite enjoyable to watch!
mr. edgar ashman must have been what tolkien had in mind when he came up with hobbits, i'm pretty sure he has oversized, hairy feet, right edgar? ;)
Good Day Edgar,  I would enjoy learning a bit more about how you train your fruit trees as espalier trees.  Am trying to train two and could use all the helpful hints I can get.  Thank you.  PS   Great segment keep up the great work.
I could spend a whole day in that garden chewing apples! 🍎
So happy to see another side of Audley End!
YAY! Audley End's cast of characters is expanding!!!
How do you prepare the soil and test the quality of it for growing your crops?
I’d like to know if (and how) the esplanade technique has been implemented at Audley End?
Seasonal floral decorations, please :)
I loved to see what your life is like and what a gorgeous, well tended garden you have created. It is obviously a labor of love. You must have a wealth of knowledge to care for all the different plants and climate. What a wonderful life and thank you so much for sharing!
please do more with Edgar! I enjoyed this!! ^_^
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Edgar the gardener
Definitely do more! :)
This was great. Please keep them coming:)
Thank you for the wonderful video! I look forward to seeing Mr. Ashman again soon to learn more gardening advice. And I hope to see Mrs. Croocombe making a Gateau de Pomme soon, too. Please keep making these videos, they're so enjoyable and educational!
Can we see more of him pls  he's cute
Ooooh I like Edgar. Another great addition to this series. Loved his interactions with Mrs Crocombe, as well.
I would love to learn some more about Victorian gardening. I remember Mrs Crocombe using edible flowers for one of her recipes. What kind of flowers were those? Are they grown at Audley End to serve that sole purpose, or are there some other useful or aesthetic qualities to them?
Edgar, can i call you big brother?
anyway, i would like to ask for a tutorial on how to tend to pumpkins and how to harvest them, when the right time to harvest them is, ect. would that be possible?
yours truly,
kyla logan
I am really loving to get to know all of the other people who work in this state can't wait to learn more
I enjoyed this very much, i wouldn't mind more harvesting and gardening. And as always it's a pleasure to see Mrs Crocombe who brought me here in the first place. Keep up the splendid work!
I am interested in the most effective way to keep pests from eating all your lovely veg (like a Victorian)!
All actors are so sweet. love this series! New subbie here 🙋🏼‍♀️
I absolutely adore this! I wonder if you could teach us about the roses?
Dear Mr. Ashman, 

I'd love to know how Audley End came about so many varieties of flowers, and, as Mr. Vert is fond of breeding apples, whether he also works to create new flowers that are unique to Audley End. If so, who is in charge of naming them?

Cordially, 
Mrs. Candy
Something tells me this dude's duties include tending Mrs. Crocombe's "hedges."  I'm familiar with those country house hunting parties.
I loved the video! Was very interesting. I'd like to know how you take care of herbs and flowers please.
Mr. Vert reminds me of a friend of mine. It's probably that delightful facial hair.
Oh my goodness I love this!  Love the cooking shows, so happy to have gardening now!!
Would you mind showing us all about the glass houses?  Thank you!!!
How to plant summer or winter bulbs, like dahlias 
BTW I also enjoyed the video a lot
I’m obsessed with this series. Victorian era is such a treat to witness as  a reanactment .
Yes I am LIVING for this English heritage gardening show! It reminds me of gardeners world
I would love to see more on the flowers in the garden, and maybe recipes with flowers?
I think I found the best video to cheer me up (plus it's educational) Keep up the good work ! :)
I love how they have the apples growing how did you train the trees to grow In that shape
This new series is so exciting. I missed Mrs. Crocombe, so it was nice to see her here too. Can't waot to learn more!
Ok this needs to be made into a tv series now
I'd love to learn how gardens coaxed vines up and around things. Or maybe how they got trees branches to grow horizontally and all together like a fence!
Very enjoyable video as always! Thank you! Cute Edgar the gardener too!
Ohh! A new video! :D
Tudo cara de Fiatinho! #BR
Hello Edgar, 
About the apples; I had a question about the storage of apples. 
I store mine on a shelf and trying to get a good use out of them. Could you perhaps show your storage and the best way to do so? Do i need to attend the apples in the meantime or just let them dry on there own? 
Looking forward to your answer.

Sincerely, 
Patrick A. Schoonderbeek
Mr. Vert = Mr. Green 😂
Thank you for the video!  I would love to see how the garden is planned at Audley End.
If you grow lavender I absolutely want some info about how that was done! I adore these videos. Thank you for them 😀
We need more videos of the Audley End household!! This is so charming!!
oh gosh he's so adorable I wanna wrap him in a blanket
Wow Mrs. Crocombe is intimidating 😱😬😵🤐
How did people in the Victorian era deal with pests and weeds in their gardens?
Please show how you tended to herb gardens! Including those for remedies.  I have rosemary that grows wild and easily but would love to know more about the others
I feel like watching "Downtown Abbey"
Wishlist: how to achieve bush-sized apple trees, seasonal vegetables, herbs, gardener's tools, same ingredients and two dishes (master and servants).
Such a nice video, cant waiting for the next :)
Isn't he just the cutest?  I want to pinch his cheek.  I never saw apples growing that way, like grapes.  That was very interesting.
I ship him with Mrs. Crocombe

But... she's already a Mrs...
I think it's great that they teach us the process of gardening, cooking and other matters while they make it look like a story. Brilliant!! What am I doing in 2018? Makes me want to go back in time 😂
Damn Edgar, you just kept Mrs. Crocombe waiting—you better act extra sharpish
I would like to know about herb harvesting, please, and about how the herbs are preserved for future use.
I would like to see a video on growing pineapples, which I understand was such a potent status symbol in days gone by; so much so that many estates had stylised pineapple finials on their gateposts!
This is so wonderful. Its just so calming and good for the heart. I would like to know something about growing herbs. And maybe storing them in the winter. I always try but it never works.
Can't wait to see more of Edgar and the garden! <3 <3 <3
Informative and entertaining! This must be the most wholesome channel on YouTube.
Oh yay! I had somehow thought you'd ended this series, I'm so glad it's continuing!
im sorry but his blue eyes are beautiful
Gardening is truly an art.  This was so informative.
Love these new characters, so interesting ❤
I love british accent. 😍😍😍 i always try speak english in british accent. Sorry for my bad english
Can you tell something more about the flowers we've seen?
This is spectacular! Please, upload more of these kind of videos. I am in live with them!
How did I miss this episode?!
This was awesome! Is there more? I hope so! 
I really want one about the root cellar. I learned you store roots in sand. Would be interesting to what they had. 
And did  they cultivate berries? Or are there recipes with roses? Could be a crossover with eatable flowers. 
I'm so excited.
This is perfection! Edgar has such a calm, polite tone to his voice. I'd adore listening to the in's and out's of the kitchen herb garden!
Oh, and perhaps growing, maintaining and using herbs. How to prepare the plants for cold weather,  household uses like keeping critters away, etc.
Dear young Sir,
 if you happen to have a hanging melon harvest we may get a peak at? I would very much like to see how they are stored and cared for. I have heard much about the old walled garden ways of growing melons hanging the vines and little nets to hold them! 
Also, I have heard grape storage in the Victorian era was quite interesting, should your gardens do such a thing? 
Sincerely, a long time American viewer.
I love meeting all these new people at Audley End! I hope someday we get to meet Lord and Lady Braybrook. I would love to hear about a meeting with the Queen.
I'd love to learn about growing espalier trees, and maintaining herbs in the kitchen garden including those grown for health!
I don't know, but mr.ashman got nice "apple" bottom there by the way 😂😂
He’s a cutie. Are you single? :)
More about Victorian gardeners, please!!  Thanks.
He is cute!!☺💕
Well...this is different...  I like it!  I'm loving how this cast of Victorian England history is growing!
Edgar is adorable! Please make more videos with him
edgar is so adorable 🥰😍
❤️ looking forward to more of these! Would love to see one on harvesting autumn squashes and gourds and also  on winter preparations 😁
Did you just say... "you read about them?" Who told you how to read?
How old are you again, 24? Yeah I guess its about time. You might not live to 30 so might as well.
I'd love to know more about the stillroom and herb use!  How did they choose what to plant? Did every house grow medicinal herbs? If so, which ones? I also love how the head gardener keeps nicking apples.  ;)
How to harvest lemons, peach and dates also Welsh leeks too 
Ta!
Every single video is so magical and charming to watch. As someone who enjoys both cooking and gardening, I'd love to hear about herbs! Favorites used then, the drying process and any other uses they might have had.
"How to pick apples - the Victorian way": You pick them when they 're ripe.
Love it , can you please show us how you grow the apple trees against the wall? They looked healthy and strong but flat against the wall ? Thanks so much
I hope we get to see something about the servants above the stairs, like a day in the life of the butler! Very well done English Heritage; I'm looking forward to this series with Edgar!
Please take a interview of actor playing Ms. Crocombe
I absolutely love this series
The stages of this video:

Starts playing* OOOOOOO new crocombe video!!! Eeee

2mins* wait....where’s Mrs crocombe?!

4 mins* they’re talking about her but it seems to be about this new imposter!

6 mins*  They’re using Mrs crocombe to get me to accept this 3rd gardener!?!

8mins* I suppose I’ll keep watching. It’s almost over. He’s kinda interesting 

10 mins*  I accept you garden slave. Keep making videos. I like you.
I have so much fun watching your videos! The garden at Audley End's looks beautiful in the apple season. Wow!
Love Edgar! What a charming young lad!
This was amazing! I can't wait for the next episodes! <3
How would the head gardener have kept up with the latest trends in Victorian gardens? I know having a pretty, well kept garden was important in the era.
I helped harvesting apples in Switzerland last season... and it still works almost the same way, they are still handpicked, with stem and without any bruises XD only difference: we sometimes harvested almost a metric ton per person and day... :')
How to cut, dry, and store herbs from the garden would be a nice video!
Did he say fruit cheese? 😱
Gateaux de Pomme, huh? Is that an upcoming recipe? :-)
Really want to meet Mrs. Crocombe
I really liked this style of video
This channel is so enjoyable!!! Yes, I should very much love to see how you are harvesting other autumnal fruits and vegetables. By and by, the 3rd gardener is quite adorable!!  ;-)
"Sharp fruity favour and plenty of juice!" As to where shall I encounter such exquisite fruit..
I love how dedicated everyone is to playing their roles. Especially Edgar silently mouthing "Gateau de Pomme?" haha. Everyone is just so gosh darn charming.
i saw Mrs. Crocombe on the thumbnail and clicked on the video so fast!
I would like to see how to espalier fruit trees. Thank you
Saplings can be trained to grow on wires. Much work though.
Charming!!! Everyone does such a magnificent job. CONGRATULATIONS to everyone who is part of it.
I would like  to know which plants are usually kept for the gardens and how you know when to rotate the flowering perennial plants to keep the gardens from looking sparse year round.
Apples are my favourite fruit. I loved this vid!
More of Edgar! He's too cute and I would love to learn more about old English Gardens. But, of course, lots more of Mrs. Crocombe should be coming as well!
Fantastic Job, I enjoy these very much.
They really should get their own TV series
Wow, beautiful apples, they all look juicy and huge, I also wouldn't wait for them to bake an apple pie or bake a crumble with all the apples, great job at the gardening
Could you show us a "normal" kitchen garden" and what plants would be grown there?  I also saw glass houses, what type of forced edibles would have been grown in that time?
Lol I love how they've no problem saying the imperfect ones are for the servants. But hey, I'd bet they'd be happy to eat anything they could produce.
I love how the gardener was late giving the apples to Mrs Crocombe, because he was busy gabbing away at a 21st century camera!
He was an absolute delight!
I like Edgar and Mr Vert! So much fun watching their interactions with the housemaid and Mrs Crocombe!
I would love to see any other gardening stuff you have! This was both Charming an informative! Are you in charge of the herbs as well? If so, I'd be happy to see how you handle those! If not, show me what you got!
Bye bye 4 now!!! You are handsome!!!!
I love these videos ty for posting.
I just love these videos. There is nothing more relaxing than sitting back and watching and imagining myself in those days.
I loved this video. He's so charming.
Bravo🌟🍎 One of the best I have watched here! Great job
I. Would like to see Christmas.. how it was done in the big house the Victorian way.
I am so happy about this new series!  I would love to see everything about the gardens and what Mrs. Crocombe does with all the produce.  In the gardens, I am especially curious to see how they worked their compost system back then.
Would Mr.Vert let show us something with flowers?
Asparagus?  I’d love to see them grown. Also the Rhubarb. Maybe artichokes as well
He sounds like Chris from Abroad in Japan, but less jaded!
Around 5:55: “they’ll have my guts for garters.” Lol, awesome old phrase.
Always interesting videos! What about a new one about pumpkins?
Mr. Ashman - I would like to know about grafting and about storing nuts
I love his face when everyone says "gatêau de pommes" 😂😂
I would LOVE to know more about the flower gardens- how they are planned and plotted- maybe Mrs. Crocombe or another character can be involved in making bouquets for the house?
g o o d l a d
awwwww I miss my Best historical farm trio now…
I love what I've learnt here and I love how everyone is so full of personality. Yes, Edgar, I would like to see you and the garden again :D
Really nice to see other characters at Audley End. Looking forward to future episodes.
8:32 Mrs Crocombe hears mr. Ashman had harvested the apples by himself aaaaaaaaaaaaand gave that look "I bet you did, young man"
Great video!! 😁❤
I love to learn and this was a very enjoyable video to watch.
I can’t get over the crisp of that apple when that man cut it
I love this so much Edgar is the purest
Your videos are so so lovely😍 Amazing!
I'd love to see more of the workings of Audley End like this, perhaps an entire series that runs through the entire year that features the gardens and the home farms as well as the House.  It would also be great to see more of the interactions of all the people who would be working there.

Mr Ashman, you are a lovely presenter, well-spoken, and showing what I think is the right amount of deference to ones' superiors while being confident in the material you are providing to the viewers. I hope to see a lot more of you in the future.
He's so adorable.  I hope this channel continues to grow and grow and branch out more and more with characters and how-to/historical life bits.
Trimming apple trees: how and when to do so
I'm ready for the gateau de pomme recipe!
Forcing rhubarb is always a good lesson for poeple who have no idea how to do it!
These videos are so beautiful and calming. I’d love to see more videos from Audley End, especially the gardens!
seasonal rotations in a garden like that.
I am so in love with this series. Thank you.
Oh my gosh he is *adorable*.
Absolutely BRILLIANT 👏
This whole video was very fun and very charming, but I have to say what really made it for me was that little OTGW nod. "Over the (kitchen) garden wall." Gods, that delighted me.
I'm writing a note below, please can you ahow us your daily routine and,when the time comes, possibly what you do in winter. You're so sweet, wish I lived in Victorian times too, I think it would suit me much better !!!
Mel C is back 😂
This was brilliant. 😍
This was amazing! I love it! I'd love something seasonal. It's fall here in the states and I'm curious about gardening
Cherry harvest, please? I love this new character, he's so sweet!
Edgar did a great job. A shame the kitchen staff were so rude to him!
Dear Edgar,  please could you show us the herb garden and what type of herbs are there and if there is a method of drying them for later use? Thank You. 💋
You are so sweet! Love you!
Did you grow fig??? How do you harvest them? Or mmm root vegetables carrot , turnips?? Anything would be wonderful!
What does a Victorian gardener know about grafting apples and/or pears? When did this practice come into being and what techniques were employed?
He is a sugar plum. So adorable I wanna hug him. Teach me how to hug.
Now I can go apple picking. This video made me an expert.
I'd love to see flower picking for decoration!
I do want to see more of him! Perhaps he could teach us about harvesting herbs?
Show the gardens and gardening prep during spring and winter
What about a typical day in the life of all the people who work and live at Audley end?
YASS APPLE BOY
Dear Mister Ashman would you be so kind and tell us more about the work of the gardeners at Audley End during winter and their preparations for springtime.
I love this! I would love to see more of the other staff as well, this whole series is a gem!
Trailer before was for the new x-men film. "I have seen evil and I'm looking at it right now" Audley End appears
I love this video! Bringing more people into this gives just a bit more of a glimpse into the day and life of this marvelous place. As always this has been enjoyable and educational thank you.
is it me, or does this lad kinda looks like TomSka ?
this is so lovely :)
I’m interested in what a gardener for a large house like Audley End would be required to provide during the winter. For example, hot-house flowers, exotic fruits/veg, anything to be used towards alcohol?
Edgar looks a bit like TomSka hm...
Wow, more characters! These episodes are so entertaining!
Great video
Oh shoot! His nose is so tall! 😍
I'd love to see something involving cherries or currants. I've always wondered if the Victorian manner of gardening matched up with my grandmother's.
Flowers, baling hay, animal feeds
Very misleading to include Mrs Crocombe in the thumbnail and then have her in at the very end only. Not okay. Im here for Mrs Crocombe only. 😑
Really, really enjoyed this video! Please turn it into a series!
I honestly wish they would do a period drama at audley end such a stunning house
Show us how to store apples the Victorian way please! 😊
He stole my heart 😍
I would like to see more about how they watered all those plants. I get to use a modern hose to easily reach all my plants today!
He's so cute. Aww, I think I'm in love. 😍
Dear Mr. Ashman,
Could you please demonstrate how the lawns were so meticulously cut? I enjoyed this video very much and look forward to more. Please let us know if you are allowed to taste gateau de pommes. Thank you so much!
I'd like to learn how you stake and prune the Dahlias.
literally living for these videos. so entertaining and really informative
I love this channel. ❤️
This young lad is as wholesome as his apples. I'd love to see him teach us pruning, pollarding, and hedging (hedgerow making? hedgerow training?)! I've heard a good hedgerow is actually quite an art form. Also, fashions in garden planning, processes of wintering, and other seasonal preparations.
I'm gonna love this! Keep em coming!
omg Edger  is so cute
Notice me mr. V -the good lad
He'll never find out about gateau de pomme RIP Edgar
I want a white shirt like his. Looks very comfortable. Edgar is precious.
I would love to see something about autumn gardening and preparation for winter etc....And anything with pumpkins would make me happy.
I love the idea, amazing, garden variety the victorian way. I look forward to more!
Rhubarb - forced or naturally grown! If Audley End garden grows it, would be great to see how! A nice addition to the Audley End team of servants - such a polite and respectful young man indeed!
Love these videos! A great birthday gift
I'm amazed at how well these videos are produced. Even their teeth are accurately British.
I really cannot get enough of this. Very delightful and educational.
I am loving this!! Solidifies my decision to want to visit the UK! Is Audley End House available for tourists to come visit? I find that property absolutely charming! Please bring more of Mrs. Crocombe, The Gardener and the Butler!! Thank you!!
Dear Mr. Ashman,
I'd love to see what should be planted in Autumn that will grow by Spring or what would be available in a Winter garden. I'm trying to start a garden for the first time on my own, but Autumn and Winter are a little intimidating. I look forward to seeing you more often. I'd love to hear about what happens between the Kitchen and the Garden.
Sincerely,
Your new friend, Zoe
I love this channel, particularly episodes like this one. Well done!
Teach me about peach harvesting!?
I like that there's multiple characters now
Edgar is such a snack! I'd definitely let me pluck my apples!
Would be interested in seeing the flowers of the gardens and how they’re used around Audley End
Dear Mr. Ashman,
I have a dilemma. How do you store potatoes? Mine rot or dry out quickly even if they are kept in a dark place. I'm confused what to do.
Yours truly,
Ms. Stephanie
He has handsome blue eyes!
I’m asian and when i first watched one of the episodes i just clicked subscribe right away. I love to see western or european culture. The way they speak ate truly lovely like GOT actors aha
A new Mrs. Crocombe! Yeah! I love these programs. It is apple harvesting time in Wisconsin.
While we do not have apple trees anymore, I can still go to the local Farmer's Market and get some direct from their orchards.
I ship it.
Seems very cool job... Picking apples..😘
You are sooo cute 😍
I love Mrs Crocombe and her no nonsense attitude..😊
Audley End is beautiful
The one with the bowler hat gives me those "I'm here to collect either the debt with interest or your fingers, you decide" -vibes
I'd love to see a tour of the herb gardens. What herbs were grown by the Victorians? How were they used in cooking?
Such a lovely story! It really feels authentic
This thick boi is kinda cute
I thoroughly enjoy this channel! Please put up lots more!❤️
Could you please give us some tips on growing all that beautiful asparagus you have there? 🌱
Hello Mr. Ashman, I live in Canada, one of the colonies.  I'd love to see a video about how you prepare your gardens for winter, and how the fruit and veg are stored, as its getting cold here, and we already have snow.
Mr.Ashman did you grow any herbs or spices? If so which ones and how did you pick them/winter them over?
AHHHH NO! TOO PRECIOUS! TOO GOOD! I LOVE THIS TOO MUCH!
Well, clearly they're having an affair
never knew that apples could be so interesting
Things I'd like to see - training the trees into trellis shapes like some of the fruit trees in the video, vegetable garden, flower garden designs typical of victorian times.
This is so very delightful. I Love your channel and everyone in it. So true to character!
What a wonderful episode!! Please produce more of these, they are such a delight to people discovering the Victorian way of life :)
I love these snippets but I hate the hellerweenie stuff..ICK.
Lawn Trimming/Care, Root Vegetables (And Storage), and Commonly (And Rarely) Used Tools
Love this video! It is so cute!!! I would love to see a Christmas special this year. Maybe how everyone hand makes their gifts?? I really enjoy those types of videos. It is rare to see that now a days.
Please keep these coming I find them very relaxing
I would love to see inside the green house or how to trim the hedges so they look pristine
EVERYTHING. TEACH ME EVERYTHING PLS THIS IS SO COOLLLL
I'd love to see an episode about the glass houses. Especially if they were trying to grow tropical fruit like lemons and oranges.
Do the gardeners also make the flower arrangements for the dinner table?
PUMPKINS AND SQUASH PLEASE YOU CUTIE PIE
How to give a gobby, The Victorian Way.
I love Mrs. Crocombe! But I really enjoy learning about other people at Audley End, so I really enjoyed this.
Good lad. Honest sort of face.
Hello Edgar, I think another seasonal item might be interesting to talk about. Maybe some information on growing and harvesting gourds. I'd also be fascinated to hear about the herb garden.
I'm obsessed with this videos 😊
if possible, maybe an episode explaining the cutting method for apple trees in an English garden. These all seem to be trimmed in a certain manner and trained to a trellis of sorts. Love the videos!
Edgar is a good lad 10/10
2000 types of apples. I didnt even know there was that many types in the first place. I was thinking 50 at max.
Mr. Ashman, 

Would it be possible for you to teach us how you cultivate your apples? I see you have trained them to grow horizontally. It's called espalier, I believe. How did you go about it? And what do you do if you notice any fungus problems?

Thank you so much, 
Mrs. Roadrunnercrazy
can we get a tv seriess pls
I would like to see a demonstration and explanation of the Espaliered fruit trees you have! I'd love to make a go of it myself, but I'm afraid of harming the tree. How difficult is it to grow and maintain Espaliered trees?
I love The Cook, The Master Gardener & This Precious Fella..  I would absolutely love seeing these three Regularly. I believe the accounts of these three positions are monumentally underestimated & are valuable this day & age far beyond the surface.
I myself am a Master Gardener & I know quite well The teachable moments are priceless & plentiful. 
Please Do consider making more episodes like this one. 
These positions were held in such high esteem. Many times the household staff not only set an example for the all of the young filling various positions inside & out of the home but in many cases, the entire staff also played,  loved & entertained the Lady of the house & Her children for a great big chunk of their lives.  
When all things are considered,  it was not about who hired whom, where but shows the complexity & depth of feeling & commitment to each other. 
But, it's just a thought, Please feel free to take it or leave it. 
Thank you
I love this channel so much
Anyone else need an apple while watching?? Just me? 🍏
I really enjoyed this!  I'm curious as to how the apple trees were more like apple bushes?
Awww he's so cute. ^.^
Please do a gardening video about espalier training your trees. The garden is TREMENDOUSLY inspiring.
I dont care what he's harvesting i just want more gardening videos.
Boo! We want Ms. stuffy crumpet!
I'm curious how pumpkins are harvested for the table,  maybe Mrs Crocombe will make some lovely pumpkin soup for supper or even a pie or two for a party.
That would be great if foraging in the Victorian era is being shown here!
I bet he taste sweet!!👅😍
He has lovely blue eyes, and such a stately nose! A face full of character. :)
love this, it's so nice to see more characters!
"Write me a note below" :3
So beautiful, life on the estate was beautiful 👍😊👼👼👼👼👼
think my computer just got colonized
Not exactly what I’ve grown accustomed to, but quite charming. I do hope next time we’ll get to see Mrs. Crocombe make that gateau de pommes.
Edgars lowkey a ride tbh
Mr. Ashman, please teach the espalier method of growing fruit trees?
Id like to know more about the espalier trees does the garden have only apple trees or are there other fruit bearing trees which have been shaped?
Edgar just charmed the crap out of me.
The fruits have a sharp, fruity flavour. Well, gosh golly! Who woulda thought? All joking aside, wonderful video as always!
The shy side glance towards the kitchen maid was kinda adorable...😂
Yay! Another person to get to know!!
Both right hand men....wearing watches in wrong pocket lol. Come on EH.
I think gateau de pomme translates to Apple Cake. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.
So charming!  I would love to see how the gardeners prepare the garden for Winter, if Mr. Vert will allow it.
I adore this! Would love to learn more about Victorian Era gardening.
I think it would be interesting to see how they dealt with crop diseases like the ones you mentioned.  It must have been a challenge!
Really enjoyed this video.
The Marvel Universe is literally shook.
This was good fun! I want to know if they ever made cider and how.
for a minute there I thought I was watching the movie ' The Secret Garden" !
I hope to see more from Edgar Ashman
I'm looking forward to more videos featuring Edgar!
I love how timid this guy is, he really reminds me of me :)
I'm curious about the clothes. Seemed a bit formal for working in a garden. The rolled up sleeves seemed reasonable but the vest and tie seemed very polished looking? Just something I was wondering. But, I love this new addition to the story of Audley End! Hope to see many, many more stories to come! :)
Edible flowers please.
Dear Mr. Ashman,
Your apple trees are just absolutely lovely however I’m dying to know all about the beautiful flowers at Audley End. Especially the roses and those gorgeous asparagus plants. I’m also quite curious about your glasshouses, at my agricultural school we had one heated with natural gas and I’m curious how you keep everything warm. I hope this note finds you with fair weather.
Sincerely,
Mr. MacMurray
Edgar is charming.
How to plant an APPLE TREE IN KANSAS AND  HOW LONG BEFORE I GET APPLES ?  I'm  guessing you are  about 25 years old I Love the show. I would love to come see it Edgar you seem so knowledgeable about all of the garden plants, fruit etc. Keep up the excellent WORK YOU WILL BE HEAD GARDENER SOMEDAY I'M SURE ,, GOOD LUCK, IT'S  A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO WORK AND LIVE NEAR I WISH I DID !!!! Do you live on property? Wow !!, a nice cottage is perfect for a young man  and at work when the owner or Mr. Vert  need you  right away for anything I love  your  voice and cute dimples
How would you handle pest in the garden?!???
After the harvest of apple is the proper storage over the winter information, please.  More know how on pruning the apple trees, please.
Edgar do you grow asparagus in the garden would love to know how that was done.
Music should be Ralph Vaugn Williams. More genteel
I like how they made a little story out of it.
I’d love to see more about storing food for the winter. I’d also love to see how the prepped seeds and such
What is the best time of day to pick the apples? Mr. Vert or the young guy mentioned there is an optimal time for picking that will yield fruit that will taste best and keep longer.
it must have taken her 10-15 minutes just to undress...lol ..ha ha
methods of pest control!
How did you trellis those apple trees? I've never seen that before. It's really pretty and neat.
How about the process from harvested pear to preserves? Mmmmmm my favorite autumnal delight!
Beautiful garden, I especially enjoyed seeing the trees pruned as they were, dont see that often. How does one train the tree like that over the years?
These delightfully splendid videos give me life ❤️
He’s so cute.
All the Apples must be the same size..lol
Mrs Crocombe how in the world you want all the Apples one size?
She is too funny yes..haha
Mr “vert” is the head gardener. Lmao am I the only one that sees the irony in that?
I love that garden. I would like to see more videos of it
Edgar is fortunate Mr.Vert didn't deliver a swift pandybat thrashing unto him in the apple orchard.
I think i am in love...
Charming. Adorable. Cute.
How about giving us a lesson on managing those miles of asparagus beds, or espalliering those fruit trees?  I've never seen it done on a wire like that, only against a building.
How to take care of herbs like basil or mint
Im really enjoying these new characters. I just want Edgar to keep turning to the camera nervously and whispering about trying not to piss off Mrs. Crocombe and Mr. Vert.
The third gardener looks like a male Mrs. Crocombe.
Caring for brussell sprouts and picking them would be great too. Not sure if brussell sprouts were popular at Audley End, but would be interesting to see!
Mr. Vert sounds like Jon Snow.
This ended up like a cheesy employee training video from the Victorian era
Mr. Vert, please let him teach us more stuff!
Would really like to see an episode on prep for Halloween!
Better and better every time, love, love, love you guys.
In the late 18th and 19th century, servants were discouraged from literacy, since being too proficient was feared to encourage thinking "above one's station," leaving them open seditious "republican" influences. Moreover, servants who could read, write, and sum would be a security risk, since they could read and understand the employers and managers letters. Not until the 1850's and compulsory education did the benefits of a literate workforce become clear.
I really enjoyed this. Both informative and entertaining. I hope young Edgar will be back. And hoping that Mrs Crocombe shows us how to make  Gâteau Breton aux Pommes.
He is so cute , hope we see more of Edgar
Edgar looks like tomska lmao
Oh Mrs. Crocombe, don't be snotty to Edgar lol. The head gardener looks like a coroner.
Dear Mrs. Crocombe, 

As a cook in the colonies and with All hallows eve around the bend, I was wondering what the festivities are at Audley End.  Please extend my warm wishes for a bountiful apple harvest to Mr Vert and to Edgar if it is no bother at all. 

Thank you very kindly, 
Marion McCarthy
I request to know about pruning and maintenance of the various fruit trees
Gahh! Stupid phone ate my comment. Oh well.😳This was FABULOUS! Meeting new members and learning about their jobs. AND Mrs.C! My fav type of apple...AND Mrs.C! My fav season and not just because I was born in it lol. What more could we ask for? Well..except for more please! I hope Mrs.C will have some spectacular fall/Halloween/Thanksgiving(uh they didn't celebrate that day did they?😳)recipes and instructions. Also I hope that famous and lovely sounding Apple Marmalade will be for sale in your shop! Please??😍🍎🍏Thanks to all of you for this wonderful series!🎃🍁🌲👻ps splendid job Edgar! Thankyou for sharing with us! I will be looking forward to more...I have a black thumb sadly. Lol.🌵🍀
Lovely video.
How do you keep the herbs bushy?
~♡~Yes, love to see more of the Garden~♡~
LOVE Edgar, way to go English heritage team
Can you do a video on espalier tree pruning
I would like to know about cold frames and what they are actually for. 😁
I'd love to know how you trained the apple boughs to grow in such linear and ornamental rows that are easy to pick from, not to mention beautiful!
I live these sooo much!
I would like to know about lemons
Edgar has beautiful eyes
I’m gonna be honest this channel would be a very good TV show on PBS.  This channel is very historical, and very educational.
English herbs garden next! Please~
What about an overview of everything in Audley ends gardens
Great video! Maybe making apple cider
Hhh...what a wonderful estate to stay.. 😍
I’d love to see him again. I really enjoyed this for being a 17 year old lol
Please make more videos..  Someone should take place of downton abbey..
but why does edgar look like tomska??
I would love this to become a new series. Honestly, I am interested in all harvesting or gardening methods at Audley End, since I have no idea how anything was done, back then. But maybe it would be interesting to see, how the gardens are prepared for the winter.
Greetings Mr Ashman!
I'd love to be able to read a journal written by one of my ancestors
When's the best time of year and the techniques to prune apple trees please.
harvesting mushrooms is new to me. ae there any good way to do such?
I usally come for Ms Crocomb but its nice to meet you Mr. Ashman. Hope we can see you soon.
I would like to see what varieties you grow at Audley End.
This channel cured my depression payed my bills and bought me a new puppy I love it so much.
O! How did you train the fruit trees to grow like that??
I wish i could bring some apples to Mrs. Crocombe in the hot kitchen.
I do agree!  There is indeed much more the apple harvesting than I ever would have thought!  This is riveting and I am so glad that the other servants are now being represented in this series.  Please oh please show Mrs Crocumbe making the Gateau de Pomme!  And also the other dish which needs perfectly matched whole apples!  In the future, could you create an episode where the butler prepares the dining room for a terribly grand evening dinner party?  Many, many thanks for this video!
I would love to see how you pick cherries! That is, if you grow any in Audley End House!
He is precious
Could you make a video about cultivating flowers?
This kid is good. More. I want Strawberries, tomatoes, and mint, specifically (assuming they grow at Audley End!)
Would love to see how you espalier your fruit trees
I ship Edgar and Marianne
What a charming young man!
I think it would be interesting to know more about what types of fruit and veg were in a typical English manor garden.  A video on something like that would be great.
he is so handsome
Isn't he adorable with that big dimple.
MISSES CROW CUM
In the states we used to have a show called 'The Victory Garden'. This reminds me of that- and I love it.
Mrs. Crocombe is not happy today
Made me feel like I was back in time
Can you do a video where you collect honey from a hive?
Adorable. More please.
Are there blueberries at Audley End? I'd love to see what you do with blueberries if you have them
As a kid who failed agriculture last term this is very much intriguing
Is this Audley End near Hertfordshire/Essex?
How about in episode on flower gardening. What kind of flowers do you grow and how do you take care of them?
I loved that you showed this.  Also, the young actor is good fun!
Yes, good sir, I would love to know how you trained the trees for what looks like the gala apples but might be a heritage breed, please and thank you!
Edgar, please what types of herbs and spices are grown at Audley End, and how are they tended to?
Pruning fruit trees and rose bushes 😁
I would love to see what goes on in the glass houses!
How did they fight pests and fungus in the garden without modern pesticides and fungicides?
This should be A tv series
THIS WAS AMAZING
This is probably the whitest thing I've seen all day.
I watch him and all I see is Neville Longbottom
One of the things that strikes me is how efficiently and carefully the harvesting of apples is done. The ripest and most perfect ones are carefully selected and picked directly for the Lord/Lady's table and stored for future use later in the year, "windfalls" (fallen apples) that aren't too badly bruised are used for servant meals,  and even the ones "too fargone" can still be used to feed the pigs. So regardless  of the condition, every one has a use and a purpose and nothing goes to waste.
2:38 Did you here that? The fruit has a FRUITY flavour! Who would have expected!
Love the Audley End videos!
It would be fantastic to see how and which fruits are cultivated in varying seasons in the U.K. for use in preserves! (I.e. strawberries in summer etc.) And gardening tips would be greatly appreciated! Maybe a demonstration from garden to kitchen -  fruit to jams etc!!
I'd love to see what the gardeners had to do during the winter months!
This is just so wonderful!! What about the plants grown inside in forced pots?
It's so delightfully "How to Downton".  :)
I would love to know how a walled kitchen garden functioned and worked!
This felt like watching a video game
Edgar and Mr Vert and show me how to pick apples anytime.
I love all these videos  about mrs Crocombe, you have to do a film  about her, please!!!   😄
Would love to see a video on keeping a vegetable garden or something like that :)
Dickon? Is that you?
Is one of that apple called cordonian ruby? #TRR
Wonderful! I enjoyed the gardeners.
Where/who os the second gardener?
What did you do for clearing weeds? Any tricks?
I'd like to know more about pumpkins or perhaps something else seasonal, and also where the functioning garden is kept for the house as well as how it's decided what is to be grown in the garden.
Mrs Crocombe for bakeoff judge
Best job ever.
That was a fun episode!  Edgar definitely needs to come back for more.  Episode idea:   Give us a tour of the tool shed and show us how the tools were used.
I LOVE THIS GIVE ME MORE PLEASE
I really like this; it hails back to a better time in many ways, when people were expected to do a good job and didn't offer or accept foolish excuses for failure. Now, people only do a job half ways and still expect to be petted and praised for it. Would love to see a return to a more merit-based advancement system in our society.
I love him??? He's such a nice lad
This is so relaxing
I have an apple tree in my back garden its very old but the apples are so lovely i also store my apples the same way.(England)
I would like to see how you prune and get the apple trees to grow in those long horizontal rows.
How'd you like them apples
I wanna learn how to keep the flowers or the herbs. I want to grew up a mint plant, but im not really sure about it cares. 😅
Why did I watch this? I saw Mrs. Crocombe in the thumbnail. Victorian clickbait! Lol
How do you control the bugs
These gardens are beautiful! I would love to have my apple trees grow like that. I have a tree that is 30 feet tall making apple harvest challenging. It would be fun to see how they train their trees to grow that way.
I am attempting to understand how i can fangirl over servants going about their quaint little lives in the 19th century but here we are. Is this hell? Yes? Good.
i love shows like this one. There's so much to appreciate. i would love to see everything there is to know about the garden. I'm sure it would be an absolute delight.
So i have a question. I dont  know if this is a gardening question but, how do you store the food through the winter?
I'm fascinated by how the apple trees are grown, more like bushes than trees. I wonder if they are dwarf trees and trained to grow like bonsai trees, to keep them low growing but still abundantly fruiting. Fascinating!
Edgar is fantastic!!! I can’t wait to see more of him! Do you think he’ll be willing to show us something about melon harvesting?
ITS ALMOST HARVESTING SEASON!
Mr Vert(e) means Mr Green....... Nice.
Yay expanding series!
8:10 Whoa girl, please refrain from putting the sass out of the cabinets
Is anyone else as confused as I am about these apples GROWING ON VINES????? when apples grow on TREES! I'm so so confused.
Growing lavender!
Could you please share hedge row fruit, such as black currants with us? Many thanks.
Charming ^-^
Please teach us how to train the apple trees into the Espalier the way they are in that garden.
ok this was way too cute. :3 im so hungry for an apple now. 0_0.
Love the way the apples are trellised how did you do that?
Wonderful eyes Edgar,the English gardens are so beautiful and interesting,I would like have a tea in this garden,greetings from Brazil
Pears. Could you please intruct me on pears as you did the apples.
What about Strawberries. My favourite
Beautiful !! My Favorite channel !!
Would have liked to see the larder...
あのリンゴでどんなお料理ができるのか、名前だけじゃわからないから楽しみ♪
What else did people store back then?
what about growing apples?
Edgar Ashman, what do you do if the apples are suffering from brown rot?
The question i have to ask you young Gardener is this- what are the best ways to store over winter apples please ?
Mr Ashman, can you please tell me all I need to know about growing and harvesting beans? I love beans, especially steamed green beans with butter.
We stan a strong boss lady
I would love to see something about veggies, any veggie really.
So interesting! Thank you!
Hes so adorable
I'm still waiting for the apple boy to go in his bedroom and uncover a nice bottle of gin, pour it in a glass and sip slowly while thinking about his crush.
0:56 A Garage Man?
I want to see how you tend and harvest that asparagus!
what about planting/ seeding winter vegetables like winter cabbage? or what happens to the gardens when it starts to get cold
Hello Edgar, my dad, grandad and great grandad were and are all incredible gardeners, I would most love to see how Victorian gardeners used their greenhouses or "glasshouses" and what sorts of plants were grown in them. thanks! hope to visit Audley End soon.
The sound of him cutting into that apple was cool and crisp. I would love to eat one of them. They looked well maintained and a technique I have never seen used to keep them tamed.
I love this little guy!
Are there any fruits that would be common in the Victorian era but have gone by the wayside in our times?
Awesome :) I could watch this for hours. The third gardener sure is charming.
So... does he become head gardener? I need to know!
This was lovely.
This was lovely
a video on the herb garden and the types grown there would be wonderful.
I've always wanted to be a part of a wealthy Victorian family... wearing those fancy gowns and all... but now I want to be a maid at Audley End XD
How do you get the trees into that shape and how exactly are the apples stored? On a wooden shelf?
Edgar Ashman's an affable chap 'round the apple trees.
Dunno if this is good or bad acting but I like it
How about care and pruning of roses?
I'm at hogwarts😍
Very sweet! A lovely addition to the cast.
I ship it.
She’s back!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
like to see Edgar show about taking care of the rose garden
Gorgeous eyes! I mean apples! APPLES! Ahem. 😘. It cracks me up they call it apple cheese when gâteau de pomme means apple cake. 😹. If its apple cheese it should be fromage de pomme but it would not make sense. Shrugs. I love this channel. But am always hungry 😹😹😹
Oh... That music makes me fancy!
Yes! Keep Tomska!
Hes got beautiful blue eyes
Is that tomska
such a nice lad!
Strawberries!
You have a gorgeous garden there. I live in America and I've only seen apples raised as trees. What kind allow themselves to be trained to a trellis?
Seems a smart fellow  ....maybe he can win a scholarship to china as years from his lifetime apples come from China not uk...and Mrs combe is replaced by a heat and eat pack from tescos .
now i want an apple!
I’m from south Florida. We don’t have apple trees here, but not even in pictures have I seen apples being grown in that manner.  Very interesting.
8:44 lmao she already knew she won the war
Edgar looks cute. ❤️❤️❤️
how would they fertilise all this lavishly large and beautiful growth all over the garden?
Will never harvest apples in my life. Watches anyway
Bring on the lawn mower
I would love to know more about what kind if any kind of medicinal pants were grown and used during the time period? Things for teas or Salves, or if plants like this were best left to the gardeners for hospitals and pharmacies? ( Edgar fantastic job at being engaging and pleasant, Mr. Vert looks like a man who knows his stuff about Plant Husbandry. And Mrs. Crocombe as always your make my day and inspire me to take cooking at a slower pace and use recopies from my families past.)
Loved this!!
Apples are my favorite! Nice to learn more about harvesting them from Mr. Ashman. I'd love to learn more about the veggies at Audley End and which were common to have in a garden as big as theirs.
I would love to see how you train the trees to grow on a trellis
Aww I like Edgar :-)
Berrys <3
This is filmed very well!
I love the head gardeners name 'Mr Green' it made me chuckle :) Also how long would those apples last?
Mr. Vert sounds like Jon Snow..
This could be a "Downton Abbey" thing and I would binge at it for hours on end :)) You know what? Just make one. Seriously. Don't think about the ratings, we'll handle that part ;)
You and Townsend's should have a collab
How do they grow the apple trees in that vine like pattern?
Lovely video! Would you mind making one about preparing a new plot for a vegetable garden? mostly root vegetables and some cabbage. And maybe one on how to store your homegrown beauties during winter ?
Mrs. Crocombe  needs to chill.
Love this!
Did the wealthy houses have herbs growing in their gardens in those times? I always wanted a herb garden of my own but I keep slaughtering my plants by accident. 😲 Gardening advice is very much appreciated. - Girl from the humid tropics
interesting🤔
The apple trees look to be espaliered onto the fence, was that part of the garden design for ease of picking? Or does it help the apples grow better?
Can we See something about the actuall storage process? And how did they precerve fruits over the Winter?
That was SO much fun :D
When he was out in the garden, I was expecting Mrs. Crocombe to scream at him from the kitchen, lol!
I would love a video on growing roses
How do you get the apple tree to grow like a grape vine on the wire supports. It looks so handy to harvest them. No ladders or extension poles. Obviously, it takes a long time I would presume to train the limbs to grow like that. Also, the straw on the ground must be for the fruit that drops off the limbs so as not to bruise them?
This is so sweet lolol
Hello, genial young fellow.  How do the gardeners select which fruit varietals to raise?  How much is too little, or too much?  How does the head gardener plan for the coming year, especially if there is a blight?  Thanks heaps.
I want to see the greenhouses!  Melons and pineapples please : )
Herb gardens please!
I would love to see the work of the gardeners according to the different seasons.
I'd like to know to what extent a manor's kitchen might be self-sufficient from the garden, also what is grown.
Nice to meet you dude and thanks for your hard work. Hope u have a chance to sample dishes made by Mrs Crocombe. If I remember correctly, Mrs Crocombe had made an Apple Hedgehog  before and she even harvested the apple herself. Now, they hired people to do such labour work, i can imagine that a variety of dishes may be made from apples lol.
Can you tell us about fertilization? How you know when the soil needs it, and whats its made out of? Or the morning routine of the gardener?
You can't just go about pulling them off the tree and putting them in a basket like some barbarian. Such a display would surely give Lacy Baybrooke a case of the vapours.
I would love to learn about the different herbs and flowers at Audly End <3
I feel so ashamed for ripping off the apples from a tree we had when I was a kid! I wish I had known this back then. Thank you Edgar! I'd love to see how the gardeners timed everything to ensure the flow of seasonal fruit and veges to table, and maybe what the gardeners did while the Braybookes were at their London home? Did the garden still produce food then?
Wish I could pick some
How do you train your apple trees. I’ve wanted to add several antique varieties to my garden but it’s not very big. I see that you have several in a small area, and am curious about your method. Also, he’s adorable... I could use a son-in-law 😂😁
His dimple is so cute!!
After watching this we had to go eat some apples 🍎.
Could we see espalier? I've heard of it and I've seen espaliered pears leaning against a wall, but I don't know how it's done. Is it period?
how about how to prep a garden for winter
I hope to see more from Edgar Ashman
When was the garden built and planted? Last summer, after my second year of uni, I worked as a volunteer at Middleton Hall garden in Staffordshire, which is a few hundred years old. Audley End garden reminds me a bit of it!
Pruning anything really
I was almost certain that was TomSka
this is so cute
HOW COULD YOU TEASE US WITH MRS. CROCOMBE'S GATEAU DE POMME AND NOT SHOW US HOW TO DO IT THE VICTORIAN WAY!!! D: D: D:
I would like to see harvesting all the vegetables in the garden, their preservation and storage.
A fine lad.
Herbs, roseMary  especially.
Hello Edgar, what is the best apple to use to make apple sauce?
How about gardening some Mums
I would love to see how you train the apples to grow like that instead of upward and out like a regular tree.
I do appreciate the politeness of the people here in the comments section. My utmost greetings to everyone here!
I know it won't be an autumn season activity, but I would like to learn about the espalier practice to make the fruit trees so easy to work with, harvest, and maintain.  There is honestly not one corner of this garden I wouldn't care to hear about.
I love watching this series
I like Edgar, he's quite charming. And looks like a cross between Adrian Scarborough and TomSka.
How to take care of the animals - The victorian way
His face at 8:40, I'm laughing
Love it!
I love to see Roses or Tulips explored.
I wonder what the next apple recipe is, where all the apples must be the same size. Can we watch Mrs. Crocombe make it?
I would like to know how you prune the roses, please.
more videos like this please! i absolutely loved it
... Now I want apples
My name is Edgar too, you are the 60th edgae that I meet.
Roses
Oh what I'd give to be a historical gardener! I guess I'll just have to stick with being a plain old horticulturist instead!
I wonder how you would pick rhubarb?
120 varieties of apples? Oh my! I love apples, I could see myself munching my way through them. Dear Mr Ashman, it was a pleasure to meet you. I'd like to know more about apple storage, as I don't like keeping mine in these new fangled refrigerators, but if I don't keep them in the fridge they go mouldy.
Mrs. Crocombe is a bit stuffy for a servant.
this is so fun to watch
I'm completely intrigued by the apple trees which look to be made into vines, similar to how grapes are grown. Is that correct? I've only ever seen free standing apple trees, so this method I'd love to learn about, Mr. Ashman. :) Thank you!
Im actually Visiting England next year in the summer. Might pop by and see you !!!
Could we have an episode about how fruit and vegetables would have been preserved? Thanks
helLLlllllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Peaches and legumes please Edgar!
How to train the trees to grow that way.
Maybe show us how to harvest an herb garden? Or show us how to pick pumpkins, explaining types of cooking pumpkins!
Their costumes are so fucking adorable. They make the past look so idyllic.
Damn that's another face of Ms.Crocombe.
And aye, the phrase: Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread.
I've never seen apples grown that way.  I'd love to see how its done
I am excited to use these tips on my harvesting adventure with my husband later this month! Of course we're peasantry so we shall be taking ourselves to the trees directly. Very cute video, loved it! 

Dear Sir, 
I would be most pleased if you would be allowed to make another video about seasonal selections as each season comes into it's own. Watermelons, for example, in the summer. They are a particular favorite of mine! Pumpkins for the fall and maybe hardier fair for winter. I would be most delighted to watch! 
Sincerely,
Happy Subscriber

:)
Mrs Crocombe put apples in every recipe
No you forgot to check the glasshouses! Lol
I would love to see asparagus picked or even a nice grapes
Edgar cute but in a rat kinda way
He's kind of cute!
Clickbait!
Yay another Mrs. Crocombe video! Always love these! Interesting to hear about the gardener’s life too. Would love to learn more about a gardener’s life - like a “day in a  life video”. Someday I hope to visit Audley End house.
Edgar- I'd really like to learn about fruit tree grafting and sizes in victorian times (it doesn't look like your apple trees are what I know as 'standard' sized trees. I would also really like to see the way your trees are trained and pruned (and when).
One more vote for herb gardening!
I'd like to learn more about the training of the apples in that manner?  What is shown would be so much easier to pick than the apple orchards of my area.
This is so delightful.
What other fruits and vegetables are grown at Audley End?
Apples on vines?
I really want to learn more about kitchen gardens: what they grew, how they were arranged, and how they preserved things for winter.
How to pull a dead tree stump from the ground?
Plant And harvest And Storage herbs the victorian way would be nice
Loved  this!
His eyes are so blue * . *
I would love to see one on historical cultivation of kitchen herbs please!
Damn Edgar is a total snac
How about we get an episode on tree-trimming and hedgerows?
I'm here for Mrs. C
One of these days I need to cross the pond and visit England.
how to maintain orchids
Orangeries please!
HES HOT???????
you say that but all i see is verte nicking apples
I loved ❤️❤️❤️ 
It’s so interesting to see
I want to know if bees were kept at Audley End.......
❤❤❤❤❤
This extended my universe
Edgar is sexy
I like the creepy camera shot from the bushes ;)
Tis the Season...i hope we get more Christmas videos this year!!
What about keeping pests out of the garden? Surely a garden so grand would have some unwanted visitors from time to time?
How was rhubarb grown and harvested?  What recipes was it used in?
He is cute as a button!
Omigadomigadomigad a new video!!!!
Ohhh please tell me about the main veggie garden and how it was planned out and what was planted at what time of year? Also what kind of insect deterrence did they use?
He is adorable.
Awesome!!!
Llloooooovvvvvveeee it
Thank you for this.  Loved it.  For those of you that would like to know more about gardening methods of the Victorian age, check out 'The Victorian Kitchen Garden,' an oldie but a goody.
Great. Thank you.
What about rose care? Like we’re egg shells used for fertilizer?
other fruit bearing trees?
How to grow blueberries would be nice
Wonderful show !   A winner.
Is this a new series
Do you make wine? Or perhaps how you keep your herb garden year round?
Since this is a Kitchen Garden please show us the spices.
So cute, I want to be his wife. Also very intresting video
More!  More!  More!
How to grow pumpkins! Techniques for keeping pests off of vegetables. Tour the larders!!!
Preserving types of nuts for Christmas, would be interesting, this was interesting about the apples.
Roses! please show us roses
I'm curious, does Mrs. Crocombe want any apples?  They weren't clear...
Curious what did he write with? Was it a charcoal? A pencil?
How cute is this!!
Damn those blue eyes :)))
I think I need this lad to come help me with my female hysteria’s treatments.  Bring them apples lad.
Tomska???
Hello Edgar, 
i have two Golden Meyer Lemon trees, they are a cross breed between a lemon and a orange, thus resulting a lemon that has a natural thin rind and more juice. so my question is, the straw that you were evening out at the bottom of the apple trees, do you think they would be a great asset to the roots of my lemon trees or do you think i should try something else out? thank you and have a great day!
I love this video and this young man! My husband and I own an apple orchard that was planted in 1912. Our 107 year old trees produce massive amounts of delicious apples of a large number of heritage varieties. It is in Southern California, which doesn’t seem like a place where apples would thrive, but our orchard is in the San Bernardino mountains at nearly 6,000 feet elevation. We have real winters with the hundreds of hours of freezing weather that the trees need for the apples to set. If you are interested in seeing more,  visit Stetson Creek Ranch on Facebook.

So you are looking for ideas. I would love to see more about your trees. If the estate is large, why are the trees espaliered? You could discuss that, the pruning and training of the branches necessary to give them the flat shape. I would love to know more  about the different varieties of apples, but also other fruits and nuts that may grow there. Perhaps some time I could share scions from some of our trees if we have any old varieties that you are interested in propagating on your estate.

And I would love to know about the fowl and livestock kept there, and their care. In one episode, I believe Mrs Crocombe use quail eggs, so I am guessing that quail would have been kept, along with chickens, geese, ducks. 

How about the selection of fine horses and their care, training and upkeep?

Thank you for your wonderful videos! For lovers of history, this is an escape to a simpler time. I’m sure that the food was chemical free and wholesome.
Apples are key to fitness. Delicious and nutritious. milk and meat are for the serfs. Apples are for the elite.
For some reason this was really wholesome? Edgar is so charming
Hello!  I was extremely fascinated to see how apples were grown...I am originally from the state of Washington in the US which is well known for their apples.  I am used to seeing very tall apple trees.  Could you please explain or go into further detail about the apple "trees"?  It almost seems like they grow like grapes--on vines?  Could you please provide more information?  Thank you so much!
how do you keep the weeds down?
Please, I would like to ask. There is a story I am writing which takes place in 1910s England. One of the parts takes place in a very poor house that is full of orphan boys and no income but from picking pockets or the small wages of factory workers. What sort of breakfast can be prepared for them, and how much could it have coasted? Thank you quite a lot.
Where is rowan atkinson?
Omg i would love to live in a community like this!!
Nice garden.
She just seems a little harsh to me. She needs to warm up
In this day and age of a Plastic Crisis, you should show us how they used to wrap up things like Meat, Veg etc to keep it. Or just how they transported it from the butcher.
Guts for Garters..! Just way too funny..!
He's soooo cute 😍😍😍
I bet he loves them dead man legs
8:24 AH! FINALLY !!
Herb growing!
''Write me a note below, make sure to delicately break that like button and subscribe''
I love it.
I love these cute little videos so sweet
I bet the head gardner has checked his ripeness 🤑👀
This was nice!
Edgar the gardener... Edgardener.
Does no one else feel that weird sense of impending doom from this video? Like it started out cute then gardener #3 started acting suspicious....
How to you prune the trees to grow that way?
How would the gardener have prevented the apples being eaten alive by codling moths?
Are we going to just ignore the fact that these apple trees are growing horizontally? I'd like to have that explained. ;-D
Maybe gardening or tending an Herb garden
Where's Avis' gâteau de pommes ? Im starving now !! (But that was cute)
Hmm...did the real Mr. Vert look like he was about to grab a girl and tie her to some railroad tracks, and twirl his mustache in evil glee? Because gee...he doesn’t look like a very nice man. He has a Snape-y vibe to him. Seems to me he’d be the kind of guy who’d take ten points from Gryffindor or assign detention to people who even vaguely look at him funny.
How, and what fruits and vegetables do you grow over the Winter?
I love this!!!
Could they show how they espralier the apple trees?
I wonder, are there pear trees at Audley End?
Very interesting video, I really enjoyed it.
Lovely episode!
Edgar ? Why did you leave your last house ?
I gotta say that the way those trees are cut is pretty interesting, must be an old garden, cant imagine them to grow sideways with just little clipper use.
Excellent!
He’s a cute Apple himself
This was cute
Hee Hee, 'vert'means green. The head gardener is Mr Green.
Very charming. I was expecting to see Edgar pulled along by the ear at any moment.
Trixie looks rough.
I'd love to know what herbs were grown.on the garden. Ms Crocombe uses them to spice up food, but does she buy them or grow them? What about medicinal plants and how they are used? What fertilizers and cures for plant diseases are used? Did they have house plants inside the mansion? Ohhh, can't wait to see more of this!😍😍😍
How do you grow the apple trees that way?
Love it.
He looks like Tomska :)))
Show us how a young apple tree gets trained for espalier..
I want to see how apples were stored.  Show the site and process and building.  How was it ventilated?
Please do rose care
How were the gardens planned and used? Was there a kitchen garden and a formal flower garden?
Yay a new video!
She needs to whip her apples out to be bruised
The third gardener is better dressed (a tie?) than I am at work...
Gateau de pomme is apple cake.
I like to how you ceap up with the roses, are uthere flowers, please.
how do you grow the apples on the wall like that :O
I would like to know what was grown in the greenhouse
Well hello there....
Come winter, I'd love to hear how the Head Gardener keeps his staff busy during the season where nothing grows! What does a Third Gardener do in the wintertime?
I love apples!
I want Edgar to show us other harvests!
How do you plan a kitchen garden? Given that different vegetables and fruits have different seasons and you'd want to have an abundance of produce throughout the year, what are some methods you use to maximize efficiency?
He's a babe
This is wonderful! I'm just starting to learn how to garden myself. Just last week we harvested our apples. I can attest that not only do bruised apples turn rotten very fast, but they spread the rot to anything nearby. Would you teach us how to keep the worms out? We're lucky to find an apple that hasn't been nibbled. In fact, I'd love to learn anything to do with gardening, including how do you get the trees to grow like that? It would sure make harvesting so much easier.
Is this... real? Like... does Edgar exist for real? Does the third gardener role still exist? Please answer. Thank you.
I love the Brits.   Especially the Victorian era.   They’re so prim and proper.   The men are gentlemen and the women ... ladies.   These little skits are wonderful.   “... these are suitably ready!...”   I couldn’t have said it any better....LOL
Very enjoyable and educational!
Well done, Edgar! What a lovely lad!
Before the advent of mechanized agriculture, one did not just waste food, nor eat more than one's share.
I am interested in how you get or what kind of apples trees you have to have to make them grow like a grape vine. I never seen that done before and find it interesting.
Please show how you care for the roses.
What a cute gardener! I’d marry that lad 😜
Very interesting, thank you.  This is the first I've seen apple trees that are not the regular, taller type.
Edgar’s so cute
What's a "boffy dinner(?spelling)"?
Spices and herbs grown in the garden? I remember reading a book about Dick Whittington and his cat, and they described his collection of foreign herbs and spices. I would imagine that with the expansion of the empire, more varieties would be available to grow (although I guess they could easily be imported). Also, I would really enjoy a video on English dairy and dairy products. Butter, cream, clotted cream, and cheese maybe?
I would be interested to learn about wether you rotate crops at Audley end. I know onions and cabbage tend to not grow very well and be suspect to rot if grown in the same plave every year. When is the perfect time to harvest a carrot? Can you tell before harvesting or do you just have to pull one up to check?
I’d like to harvest her victorian apple 🍎  🍏
they seem to have TREASURED n valued produce so much back then, whereas nowadays we treat it like disposable throwaway mass garbage.......
This made me crave apples so bad!
Why are you training the trees like grape vines? Rather than allowing a more free form tree.
150?! And only apples?  How big is this place? Did they sell/ exchange their goodies?
T T - Tomska?
Well given the amount of time to make the vid and when it would be able to come out I think late fall/winter veggies like squash or pumpkin would be good! You could teach us how to protect the produce from frost and talk about what it’s like harvesting in colder weather. Plus then we could see some downstairs Victorian winter wear! Dual fun with learning about the produce and Victorian life in the winter!!!
If a diary is how people in the future can learn about you if you want to have a chance to be known in the future you should keep a diary?
I'd love to watch a video on how to properly grow Borage flowers (Borago officinalis).
I'd love to see the herb garden, what sort of herbs they would have kept and what they used them for.
Asparagus! Was that asparagus behind the apples? I’m trying to grow some 😂
Herbs
How do you plant or grow a new fruit/veg that has just come to England from overseas? I remember reading that foreign goods flooded in in Victorian times - How was that handled? or were they just bought?
Roses, please, Mr. Ashman! Especially how to control fungal disease, like rose black spot? I know baking soda can be useful, but I guess I'm doing something wrong, since spots are keep coming back in a short time. Help please! :)
Edgar is hot
That man is the definition of adorable. Do tell me more about apples, sir!
Oh my gosh this is amazing! Please make more of those videos!! <3
Love to see a video on how the apple trees were espaliered!
oh let there be discussion on the herb gardens later on as well as the different types of gardens, like the glass house gardens?? did the house gardeners interact with any nearby farms at that time & why, also a more in depth overview of tools would be interesting as well <3 i shall be awaiting the next videos with great interest!
Aaahhh!! squeals in delight :3
My favorite channel.
Lovely and very informative video!
Lovely surprise on a Monday morning!
How do you keep the shrubbery looking nice? Does it involve a lot of trimming? What sort of vegetables do you grow on the grounds and what is the hardest food stock to maintain?
What stunning  looking gardens ....
I would love to know about pest control at Audley End.
Excellence.
😊☝👏
I like  that the bruised ones are fed to the pigs ...lucky pigs ..
a rose video
Can you do a video about how they were washing the clothes and dishes in 18th century. What products they were using I really want to know
Naughty Mr. Vert. He took the apple for himself and eat it as a snack while walking away. Hey, give him some will you? And hey!  He took two! 😂😂
I am curious as to the types of vegetables and fruits Audley End gardens had to have for the kitchen. Also, where the gardeners in charge of the floral parts of the garden as well as the crops? If so, please show how the gardens were kept in such a beautiful condition.
Pear picking
They’ve just raised the bar so much! Best series on YouTube. I’m here for all of it.
150 varieties on one estates? WOW.
I'd love to see how the layout of the gardens is designed and maintained and any history going along with them, please. Thank you and I wish you all a lovely week.
This video was absolutely brilliant!
Mrs. Crocombe is soooo sassy 😍
I would love a video teaching the correct method on how to prune and care for apple and pear trees.
Charming! And nice to see Mrs Crocombe!
Show me them figs!
Is anyone know the difference between "gateau de pomme" and gâteau aux pommes"?  I don't know if it's a misunderstanding but french people say "Gâteau au pommes" I think it's the right way....
We love Mrs crocombe
I didn't know you could train apples on a trellis! Very practical- there's no falling off ladders. I don't much care for Victorian labor relations. Hopefully there's an episode where socialist agitators encourage the servants into bloody revolution!
How lovely.
Well I would like to know what all do u have in the garden that would be a interesting video
Other fall fruits or PUMPKINS if you have them please sir
Good day to you Edgar, you did a wonderful job with the apples.How do you like your apples,do you like pie? Do you have winter squash,like butternut? What are your duties during the winter? Hope to hear from you.
take us a garden tour, veggies and fruits
Hey Edgar! Do you have an herb garden? We'd love tips on herbs, and basil in particular! And don't let the kitchen staff be too mean to you... You're doing fine! :)
Maybe I missed them but would we get to see a little of Lord and Lady Braybrooke? Maybe they can explain what they do? I’m sure it’s not only lives of leisure. If you feel the lives British aristocracy has been overdone I’m thinking more of the lord and lady as people. Either way it’s awesome to see them expanding more characters you feel connected to them and seeing Mrs crocombe make a “cameo” makes her more a living character for me, like she has a life aside from cooking for us lol
What a lovely channel.
Were house servants paid?
Hes quite thick and full bodied, sexy
I’d love to know about the dahlias growing
Very Well done
I love this!
I would love to learn about their herb garden, if they have (had?) one! What herbs they grew, how they cared for them and what they used them for... :)
I'd like to know about berries like blackberries at this time. Were they only wild or were they grown? How were they harvested? If they were grown, how were they managed? What times were they harvested? Thanks!
I thought I saw some lavender and sunflowers in the garden. Are these used to dress the tables at Audley End or are they used to make personal accessories/soaps/perfumes/oils/products and supplement the household income? A lovely glimpse into other lives as usual!
Are any vegetables  grown in the glass houses on the estate?
Watch at 1.25x
Grapes... or strawberries would be nice!
I guess informative but acting is.....
PUMPKINS!!!!!
Does anyone know who plays Edgar Ashman?
🤯 Never have I ever seen apples grown this way! I've only ever seen trees!
So how does he clean up? I was hoping to find out too.
How about  the herb garden, ones we use today or even ones the victorians grew
How do you get the trees to grow like that?
Very fun video, love the old ways! Cozy, like to watch when I'm working in the kitchen and around the house.
U hhhhh this is annoying just pick it up and eat that's it 😥
what a shame the cook is so haughty and unfriendly       that was not always the case in the victorian period
How does one train apple tree limbs to run along lines like grape bushes??
I would like to know more about pest/disease control and also how to keep pollinators happy! In my area, I'm constantly trying new things and would be interested in how this used to be done!
He reminds me of young Simon Pegg
I would like to know how  food was stored and preserved and what they used as pesticides .
Am I the only one surprised at how nicely the two men are dressed? Those don't look like clothes to get dirty or sweaty in, but I suppose they're not doing that kind of work today. Are those regular clothes for gardeners or are they extra fine because it's a fine house?
I have been trying to grow potatoes and garlic as well as other herbs. Would you mind telling me about those if you have the time?
Picking up the apples that have fallen to avoid wasp. I wonder what other techniques and methods were used before the invention of synthetic pesticides.
I would like to know more about the varieties of vegetables and fruit grown generally in the UK at this time, and how the seeds are preserved and stored for future gardens.  Many vegetables, such as tomatoes and cucumbers, grow in the hot summers of the United states outside under the blue sky, but I understand they must be grown in a hot house in the UK.  I am interested in learning more about this subject - gardening methods and heritage seed preservation at this time period in the UK.
This looks like a skit on a gay porn movie
Can a apple trees grow in Florida ?If they can't, do i need a garden house to keep the temperature right?
Do you have nightshades there? Tomatoes and eggplant and things? How were they taken care of - especially considering how finicky they still are!
Dear Mr. Ashman.....I’m baking a Dutch Apple pie tomorrow night and would like you to come over for a taste or 20. ☺️
0:57 I don't care about you "Edgar," I want to see Mrs. Crocombe!
please do one about the vegetables they would grow and cook there! I know you guys probably don't have actual animals there but one about the live stoke and how they feed and eat the animals at the castle would be great too!
How did the gardeners train the apple trees to grow like vines? I have never seen anything like this in the US. It is a most curious way to grow a fruit tree, but it looks like a very easy way to harvest the fruit.
Can anyone tell me who the actor is?
Eyh Mrs. Crocombe’s gotta certain fancy for her Apples, eh Steve??
The LOOK she gave after Dead Man’s Leg!

Why is this a pudding?
Mrs Crocombe does not approve calling roly-poly pudding " Dead mans Leg".
She has class!
"It doesn't matter how it looks.  It's for the servants."  love that line

I enjoy your presentations.
Please, give this woman finally her own TV-Show!
Lord and Lady Braybrooke will never know that Mrs Crocombe is Youtube Queen Of Victorian Cuisine :))
Who else starts to smile as soon as the title melody starts playing? 😄
"I've even heard people call it Dead Man's Leg."

/disapproving look that would shake the strongest of men to their core
When she said "MARIANNE had already prepared my filling ingredients..." at 2:21 I jumped, like I was Marianne being caught by Mrs Crocrombe for slicing onions instead of dicing them. And that shade she threw when she emphasized it was Marianne who did the cutting. 😂😂😂
alright! i was wondering when Mrs Crocombe would make another video,i will never get tired of these lovely videos it's like i am in a cooking class with her.
Dead Man’s leg 👀. The look . . . Priceless!  I absolutely adore “Mrs. Crocombe”😍💐💐💐💐
omg the look at 4:15 ! MRS CROCOMBE HAS SASS AND IM HERE FOR IT
I never want to be on the receiving end of Mrs. Crocombe’s evil eye. 😁
The look after "dead man's leg" is priceless
Our Queen of the Kitchen has returned!
My Victorian babe is back! 💖
Roly poly us to heaven, Queen
YAY! I MISSED YOU! ❤
I had to stop EVERYTHING just to see her again!  I love it! <3
See a Mrs. C. video is available. Hit like. Pause and get cup of coffee to settle in for this treat. 
Was not disappointed! I loved the slightly disapproving look she gave after she allowed that some people called the wrapped, pre-boiled poly ‘dead man’s leg.’ 
I might opt for a puff pastry version, baked crispy brown.
I've been waiting for a new one of these for sometime, you've been terribly missed Mrs Crocombe! I am happy for your return to us, as i believe many of us are.
Thank you, Mrs. Crocombe, for another delicious recipe. I love your expressions..and how we call in the modern era "throwing shade" at the vulgar name of Dead Man's Leg to describe this delicious savoury pudding. Cheers!
That look at 4:15 made my whole day!  This needs to be a meme!  Also, this looks like it'd be pretty good.
What I wouldn't give for a TV show set in the kitchens of Audley End House with Mrs Crocombe as the protagonist!
That is fortifying food for the staff who do backbreaking work for 14-16 hours a day.
Ugh. My week has been made.✨
One of my favorite stories as a kid was Beatrix Potter's The Tale of Samuel Whiskers a.k.a The Roly-Poly Pudding, so when I saw the title of the video i was so excited!
Such a simple and hearty recipe, I really want to try making it!
My first ever roly-poly was eaten fresh from the boiler, ugh. My Auntie fried the leftovers next morning oh my! What a difference. So much better fried.
All the Americans staring at this going, "That's not pudding."
I love this . She is an amazing actress and I love how she cooks these awesome meals
Happy to see everyone loves her and missed her as much as I do! WELCOME BACK MY QUEEN
👍👍👍   Always happy too see Mrs. Crocombe
I've not seen a savoury roly poly before even though I'm British. Have to say I think I prefer the sweet variety with jam topped with custard, but I might give this a try one day.
This dish reminds me of the one my late Grandmother used to make. She was from Belfast Ireland, and she made a fruit filled version of this with currants called "Plum Duff". After she did the prep for it, she would boil it in a newly bought (and washed) pillowcase turned inside out and tied up. I never ate any of it but it was fun watching her make it.
OH YAY!!! Mrs. Crocombe is back!!!
We absolutely LOVE Mrs. Crocombe!! @English Heritage: Are you going to publish copies of her old book? I would buy one (or two) in a heartbeat!
"Smells devine!" 👌😋😋
I like the warm sun lighting in this one
the behavior mrs crocombe exhibited was iconic. the legend jumped out
Please do hurry with the cookbook!  It has to have fabulous photographs, lavish and gorgeous!  Hurry!
Wonderful! That look at 4:15 is priceless!
Glad you're back!  I've never seen anything like this before but if it has bacon and a crust, I'm in 🙂
I could watch your videos over and over. You’re pretty awesome!!
omg mrs crocombe is back yaassssssssss
That sideeye!
👍 I've always wondered what reply poly pudding was. Thank you for the clear instructions and the amazing delivery. This actually looks like a good way to use up many types of leftovers.
i love these videos lol mrs. crocombe is so charming !!
It’s been sooooo long!! Welcome back
Aww I missed this aesthetic ❤
Mrs. Crocombe is my favorite!!
Eeeeeee! So wonderful to see our favorite lady cook back in action 😍
But .... no cucumber ?
Fantastic as always!
I am in love with the videos! Why did we stop to cook like our Grandmothers? No expensive Kitchenmachines or other stupid things..just 2 Hands and a heart for the past. You made my day! And I will try it too. I think, I started with the victoria sandwiches and after this...Roly Poly Pudding :-) all the best from Germany!!!
I love the mixing bowl!
These videos just put me to ease, they're absolutely delightful and informative.
Thank you for another Mrs. Crocombe video! I always look forward to these. This is the first boiled pudding I've seen (I watch Townsends a lot) that actually looks really good. I still think I'd prefer baked, but I'm interested in how frying helps the flavor/texture.
Thank you, thank you! I love these episodes! That look, though, it made me laugh out loud!
I’m gonna do this recipe this weekend
Omg I burst out laughing at the disapproving look she gave us after she said "Dead Man's Leg"🤣
Yay!! Mrs Crocombe is BACK!! Make more videos!! I love watching her!! ❤️❤️❤️
I was SO Happy to see  this pop up on my screen!!! Thanks for making another cooking video with more to come I’m hoping!! ❤️👍🏻
Omg Thank God your back.... waiting for your videos so badly..☺
Please more soup recipes!
Absolutely amazing as always!
I love u mrs crocombe, want to see more of her recipes and cooking . They are the best .
FINALLY WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, MADAME CROCOMBE!
i love watching these videos so much! thank you for providing them :D
Oh honey we miss you ma'am
Once again a lovely recipe for us hard working ones😉❤
Always here for ms. crocombe! And that sass is WORTH IT.
YYAASSS I love these videos :)
Made my day , thank you !!
It looks so good! Glad to see this lovely lady again!
Looks delicious! Love this series!
I love Mrs Crocombe cooking videos !
I am going to try this! For a moment i thought she was going to bake it like a pizza. But she boiled it! Then, fried it!! Love this channel.

Looks great and so tasty.
This made my day xo
I can't be the only one who immediately thought of Tom Kitten and Beatrix Potter at this :) Wonderful work as always!
I missed you mrs Crocombe
MRS CROCOMBE RETURNS
Well, with a bit of "modernization" could be very interesting! It looks delicious 😋 and Mrs. Crocombe is always the best 🔝
Gereat😍 Lemon bakewell recipe please ma’am 🙏🏻☺️
I fully have to admit I do not understand why one would boil a pastry, 

Let's call it giant noodle log
I missed you so muuuuuuuuuuch!!!! yeeeeei!... nice you see you Mrs. Crocombe!...
4:11 I've even heard some people call it DEAD MAN'S LEG
4:14 Her face tell us "DON'T YOU DARE CALL IT DEAD MAN'S LEG."
this seems like one i might make!
Aaaaaa she's back~ 💓💓💓
"I've even heard people call it dead man's leg"
Makes a face that clearly says do not call it dead man's leg
This is (again, like always) a great video and I started laughing at Mrs Crocombes stare. She's just amazing!  
And I have a question..a few months ago there was a survey about Mrs Crocombes recipe book. What was the result? Will there be one? And if so when? I'd love to get my hands on all of her recipes. :D
Mrs Crocombe videos always warm my heart. 

This dish looks particularly yummy!
Yayasss she's back!
Just started watching these videos and I'm hooked.😊
For the love of God, someone please make a gif of Mrs. Crocombe's disapproving stare so she can ascend to meme-queen status.
stuff made for the household: Looks like it might be good, maybe not, may hafta try to see. 
stuff made for staff: Holy shit that looks delicious please put in my mouth!!!!!!
4:12
That look...
Dear god...

That Is the miss Crocombe we all love. 
XD

Soo classy and professional.
Truly the personality of a hard working, old fashoned woman.
Im crying💖😭🙏She is so precious💕💕💕I love her💖💖
This series is the best of english heritage. Please continue this amazing series. Videos like this can cure depression... Wish I could meet the real Mrs. Crocombe 💖💖
Saw this in a Beatrix Potter book. Never clicked so fast XD

Edit: at least she didn’t put a cat in it lol
You know, I think I could be convinced to eat this, especially fried golden and gorgeous. Bacon fat would be excellent for that step. :D
😂 omg the shade at 4:15 my powdered wig was SNATCHED
Yummy!!!😋🥖🥓
Always excited when there is a new video with Mrs Crocombe!! This is why I am subscribed to this channel. Love her videos.
Can we learn about some of the more odd ingredients that Victorian cooks used?
By the way... Did anyone else screenshot "The Look"? 😅💖 I'm going to treasure that image!
Guys!! Best one yet!! Mrs. Crocombe sass kills me every time! @4:12 to @4:15 🤣🤣🤣🤣 dies
Victorian age. True bloody England 👍
It doesn’t matter how it look, as it is for the servant. Haha omg so funny
...aaaah, you caught me having five minutes.
.
.
That look though.
.
.
Anyway, Happy New Year Miss Crocombe! Love you.
Mrs Crocombe: MARY ANN.....

Me: waits for Mary Ann to come on screen.

Mrs Crocombe: 
Watching this took me back 50 years. My mum used to cook this! exactly the same recipe and then sliced & fried in lard. It's not for weight watchers but tastes brilliant. I used to love helping to make the pastry.
Glorious
Yay! Missed Mrs.Crocombe so much. I loved that little side eye when she mentioned "dead mans leg"! Oh snap! Go girl! Thanks guys.😍🇬🇧
Damn. The way she said "Mary Anne" made me think Mary Anne was going to be in the video, but no. Just an awkward mid sentence  pause. 😖
I just noticed that she never eats any other dish, EXCEPT this one  cause it's a peasant Dish.

OH GOD ,MISS, MY LADY, Even the food you cook has a level.
"I've even heard people call it Dead Man's Leg.
"*DARK STARE AT THE CAMERA TO SHOW MRS. CROCOMBE'S DISAPPROVAL*
I love Mrs. Crocombe shade!
Thanks for sharing,shared. p.s. I Love You. in a cooking kind of way. Thanks ever so much.
Love her to the moon and back. My life would never have been COMPLETE without her videos. Her look after she says "some call it 'Dead Man's Leg'." LOL 😂 she had me dying of laughter.
2:20
' MARIANNE .... has already prepared my ingredients'
Finally, A lovely cooking video will make my beautiful morning rise
She might not indeed the best chef, But She indeed the greatest Victorian chef; She also have a wonderful encouragement
So, shall we serve a big like to this amazing video?
I enjoy this channel so much. Mrs Crombie - made my day!
Apparently, the British, calls anything a pudding :D
4:14 i busted out laughing that look of disapproval was to much for me😂
"Dead Man's Leg."

LOL!!!! That look she gave after saying that! 

In any case, this recipe looks good. I think I'd enjoy eating that.
I find these cooking videos etc. So relaxing ☺️
Yes!!!! Couldn't be happier to see a video in my feed! 😍
This comment section is so pure. I wish all of the comment sections on here were like this and this looks so good! Even if it’s for the servants 😂😂
Best channel on YouTube . I still can't believe but you look the same as my aunt.
I actually tried it. My whole familiy loved the recipe! I think it tastes way better if you bake it out in butter, but that depends on you. Just a tip: roll it together tight, otherwise it will fall apart and won't taste as good. Thank you for the videos! ❤💕
When she rolls up her sleeves, I was like"She gonna be doing something amazing. "
The place you shoot is amazing 😘😘😍
Mrs Crocombe's expression on the Dead Man's Leg was hilarious! 😂😂😂 So glad a new one's finally up, I love watching these vids. ❤️
4:15 the disapproval had materialized on its own I can't stop laughing =))))))
Sherlock Holmes would surely crawl out of his coffin just to taste these 😋
the expression after she said "dead man's leg"
EPIC!!!!
Had a good chuckle thinking about all those gluten free eaters.
Oh my, this looks savory and delicious.
I am going to buy some tallow just to make this in the week.
I forget that in England "pudding" is not at all the same thing that Bill Cosby was selling us on television in the States.
that really looks like a dead man's leg....
i wonder what it taste like


i hv watched all of Mrs.C videos.....WE NEED MORE !!!
That look at 4:13
VICTORIAN SHADE
"You've caught me having 5 minutes!" LMFAO
haaa always so relaxing to watch
THE SHAAAADE OF IT ALL👀
Roly-poly pudding and sassy-classy Queen👑
She’s amazing. I wish I could have a full cooking show with her. An hours would not do her justice still. 

I love this woman 💐
Bless Avis Crocombe (and the brilliant actress who plays her)! The expression after saying "Dead Man's Leg" was priceless! Whenever I see there is a new video with Mrs. Crocombe I give it an immediate like - I would watch an entire television series of her.
I'm always waiting for Mrs. Crocombe's episode. Her videos are my favorite for it gives me some sort of peaceful feeling everytime. 🍃
no idea what this is , but watching all the videos...this lady is so perfect in her role...love them!
Tasty has nothing on Mrs Crocombe's recipes TuT
Finally some victuals for the actual working people! :) I want to see more of what the Servant ate themselves. It’s lovely to see Mrs. Crocombe in any capacity but it does my heart good to see her actually eating the work of her hands... not trussing up a fancy concoction to send over to the ‘Lord’ and ‘Lady’!
I am so damn obsessed with these cooking videos. So peaceful, so sassy, so wholesome, so historical.
dead man's leg I am in love!  I have always loved cooking and baking, but you have kindled in me a love for a whole new trove of recipes.  Thank you!
Mrs Crocombe’s cooking videos are an absolute treat! I have to bring my life to a complete halt whenever a new one appears. My favorite cook ever! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me again! I just love that under eye look!😈🇬🇧
We need more videos! I wish we would get more of delightful recipes before Christmas season ❤️
BEST. COOKING. SHOW. EVER!
My Nan made something similar called a Bacon Badger (no, really!) but she used sage instead of onions and way more bacon.
Ok this is definitely my favorite  series of videos on YouTube. She really needs her own period cooking channel with full videos! Would love to see more behind the scenes and bloopers too! And definitely looking forward to her interview.
Wonderful! !
I live for these videos! She's absolutely my favorite.
"dead man's leg"
* stares into your soul * 
* puts the pudding into boiling water *
Love your channel!!  It brings history alive!!
I grew up with Jam Roly Poly, which was definitely more of a pudding pudding being sweet, served with hot custard (in my house) or cream/Ice cream in others.
Excellent.  Just excellent.
*Note to self* Never say dead Man's leg around MsCrocombe!!😂😂
Please make recipe videos more often!!!! I love them so much!!
damn even the servants be living it up with her cooking
Everytime I hear this title, I'm constantly reminded of Beatrice Potter and her amazing stories! ^^
“Dead man’s leg.” disapproving look 

🤣🤣🤣 I love this series!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I swear, when she was rolling up the pastry it looked like the world's most awesome victorian breakfast burrito lol.
The entire production of Mrs. Crocombe videos are perfect. From the Mrs, Crocombe herself to the editing, the music, set and presentation. It's all so well done.
i was expecting this to be jam roly poly and got very confused when she said mushrooms
Why hasn't Mrs Crocombe being made a Dame already?
Post some more videos. 😍 I totally missed her.
Would really like to try the sausage version. Missed you, Mrs. Crocombe💗
It's long over-de for another Mrs Crocombe video!@!@!@! WE MISS HER!
Lol. The look at Dead man's leg. Gotta love Mrs. Crocombe. 😄❤
That look she gave after saying "Dead Man's Leg!'  I think I'm in love!
"...dead man's leg" knowing look 

I love Mrs Crocombe!😂😂
The Iconic Queen of cooking is back ugh what a blessed day
Finally a cooking show where I don’t get hungry 
Love the show
Betty Crocker is QUAKING
Welcome back, Mrs Crocombe!  Love that video.  Can't wait to make it one day!
It could be called "a collection of infant hearts" as long as there's a ratio of 100:1 bacon I'll eat it
Yes! We love you Mrs Crocombe ♥️
Looks like stromboli 😍😍😍😍
Mrs C should be on Netflix  It would be awesome!
Beatrix Potter led me here.
This looks a lovely and proper roly poly pudding with no soot or schmutz.
reads "roly poly pudding" and immediately remembers the Beatrix Potter cartoon (°w°" )
I like how the recipes' instructions are detailed beneath the vid. It makes it easier to follow along w/the video! Great videos like always! :)
I've added this tasty treat to my book of recipes! So thank you for that! Can't wait to try it!
i am so addicted watching her videos.. i like her attitude, her cooking skills, the cinematography are so perfect!.. i love this channel... more videos of Mrs. Crocombe pleaseee.... this video is a relaxant for me..
This is so relaxing, I watch it after going to bed
"Dead man's leg"
And that look is all like "Do I really need to explain this one?"
I needed some simple class in my life today so I decided to watch my favorite series on YouTube 🕯🕯🕯
The look of disapproval at calling the pudding "dead mans leg" made my day.💜
Mrs. Crocombe!!!!!! I want to hug you!!!!! ❤❤❤
I don’t usually watch these types of videos but they’re so wholesome and I love it
OUR QUEEN IS BACK THRIVE AND GLOW BEAUTIFUL GODDESS WE LOVE YOU WE WORSHIP YOU GIVE US LIFE GIVE US LIGHT
Mrs Crocombe deserves her own TV show - these videos are wonderful!
Love it. I've made jam roly poly before, but never a savoury one.
That damn look verified what I was thinking
We should have more vídeos of Mrs Crocombe!!! 😊😊😊
love the sister credits
you should know mary anne if you know mrs. crocombe
Who else answered when she said hello in the beginning? I just love watching  this lady😊 These videos are rare but like gold imo.
Probably asked a thousand times, any costuming buffs know anything about her dress? Specifically a pattern to make one similar?
Never bored watching Mrs Crocombe's video.  I become her fans..  Love from Indonesia
She does a great job playing the role for the time period and the recipes are interesting
What?? I'm only at the ingredients but I know roly poly pudding with jam! I'm confused.
Would this work with ground beef and tomato sauce or cheese.
Mrs Crocombe gives a priceless look @4:15
I'm watching these because I miss Downtown Abbey 😔
I love the look she gave after saying Dead Man’s Leg 💀🤣🤣
Thank you for this recipe, you’re amazing at what you do on here! Keep up the wonderful work!
MY NOTIFICATION BELL DIDN'T WORK, I'M ONE WEEK LATE!!!! T^T
Y E S I MISSED THIS SO MUCH
4:15 sass😂😂🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻 
I’VE MISSED HEEERR 👑👑
IM LIVING FOR THAT SIDE EYE SIS, THE SHAAAAADE. THE REAL QUEEN OF ENGLAND. QUEEN ELIZABETH WHO?????
Yay it's Mrs Crocombe again!
The look she gave after saying some call the pudding "dead man's leg" lol!
"i've even heard that someone calls it a dead man leg!'
(YOU SHOULDNT CALL IT LIKE THAT)
Everyone is in love with her but honestly I'm terrified of her. She looks like she'll smack the back of my hand if I hunch my back at dinner. Lmao
Welcome back. I love you and this channel ever so much
Fabulous videos, I have really only just discovered Mrs Crocombe's videos some weeks ago. And what a treat to watch.
4:16 f***ing Icon 🙌🏻
Love the recipe <3 might as well try this lovely one :)
Suet, fried in lard, stuffed with bacon...
A channel with Role play and recipes? Subbed.
I'm a bit sad that Mrs. Crocombe didn't get to have her five minutes.
Lovely video as always~~ one thing though and that is I missed where there is a background song when Mrs Crocombe is speaking, since the music is gone when she's talking, it's getting quite lonely.. Please put the music back again when she's talking.. 😢♥
1.5 hours in boiling water? Whoa! So long! Final results after frying looks amazing!
You had me at bacon!!! Throwing shade at the term “dead mans leg” with style.
Mum makes Roly Poly pudding with jam and sultanas.
I haven't understood how many time we must let the pudding into bowling water. One hour and five minuts ? Thank you.
Why did I think this was going to have roly poly bugs in it
Finally! Thank you so much for bringing Mrs. Crocombe back, we missed her! ♥️
it's like fried dumplings. seems like the servants get better food. 🤣
The ingredients for the pastry is similar to the pie crust my mother uses. She uses crisco instead of suet, though. I can't imagine the texture is too different.
I was waiting to some sassyness to happen and that dad man's leg look got me laughing lol you go girl
"It doesn't matter how it looks as it is for the servants but I will make the filling plenty" 

Translation: servants aren't shit and I'm doing them a favor by bothering to keep their bellies full
The actress playing Mrs. Crocombe is a wonderful and amazingly talented woman. I keep for getting that I'm not watching the actual Mrs. Crocombe
I've never had a savory pudding before. I really wanna try one.
"Dead Man's Leg....  👀" Mrs. Crocombe does not approve. 😂😂
This was posted on my birthday! :)
I could watch her videos all day and, never get bored. Thinking about making this roly poly pudding now 🤗💗
I ROARED at the look after "Dead Man's Leg"....
Normally like her recipes but this one felt a little too far removed from modern diets for me to consider!
You English certainly have a lot of meanings for the word pudding
Yay! I have been waiting for this!
That looks she gave after the 'dead man's leg'!!!  So wonderful.  Can't wait to meet the actress, she is so wonderful!
I made this recipe after watching this ,and it turned wonderful,, I am going to make more of the old fashioned dishes,
Yay 😀 oh my god I love  the way she cooks very relaxing
Only yesterday I wondered if there would be some new videos of Mrs. Crocombe one day, and today I found this surprise! 😊
I watched this video twice, just for her look when she mentioned the "dead man's leg", lol. 
@English Heritage: Christmas time is nearly just around the corner ... wouldn't it be possible to release her cookbook then?!? So many people seem to be interested.
The expression on her face when she said "Dead Man's Leg" ROFLMAO!! OMG
Wow they had really good cameras back then
Man... I wish I could taste that!
Awww I miss you Mrs.Crocombe! Love your accent and your gestures <3
I figured out what suet was I always just assumed it was solely for bird food. 

su·et
the hard white fat on the kidneys and loins of cattle, sheep, and other animals, used to make foods including puddings, pastry, and mincemeat.
I choked on my laughter at the LOOK after calling it Dead Man's Leg!!!
Wonderful video as always! :)
"It doesn't matter how it looks as it is for the servants".
Lol this is so realistic
Dead mans leg 😍😘her looks😂
The servants at your house are lucky to get such a nice meal!
I was expecting the roly poly pudding made of cake and jam XD
Oh Ms.Crocombe!! That look after relating one of the slang-names for the dish, is priceless.!!
Your step-by-step instruction is helpful and that look after "Dead Man's Leg" made me laugh. I love the peaceful bird chirping in the background. Thanks for making this instructional yet relaxing video on how to make Roly Poly Pudding!
"I've even heard people call it dead man's leg




I would recommend to avoid these people considering the news about that pie shop in Fleet Street."
Oh yes! These are absolutely AMAZING!
Omg can this please be a weekly thing? Pretty please? I don't have the patience to wait a very long time for Mrs Crocombe! I wanna see her every week!
I absolutely ADORE your videos! It's like stepping into the past!
WE MISSED YOU !! More of this please !
“It doesn’t matter how it looks for the servants” Queen of shade 😂😂😂
Yay! Thank you for uploading and making my day!!
I'd never heard of a savoury roly-poly, interesting. I'd bet that was fried in dripping - the leftover fat from meat - rather than pure lard which was reserved for other dishes.
Pitch perfect presentation. Didn't miss a beat or traverse into the realm of irony or parody, just played it straight, like a drama. And I learned how to cook something interesting!
Basically boiled and fried dumplings- but in a loaf form! YUM.
Lard + Bacon + Butter = 💀
This looks so good! Question instead of suet can I use lard?
Mrs.Crocombe: some people called it deadman’s leg..
gives out that “are you joking” stare
Mrs Crocombe's look at 4:15!!!!! HAHAHAHAHA I'M DEAD!!! XD
An hour and a half on my hob? I don't want to know what my electricity bill will be 😂
"I've even heard it called, 'Dead Man's Leg.' We do not have truck with such rapscallions here at the house..."
Maryann will soon have her own cooking show!!!
Mrs. Crocombe said how you wrap the Roly Poly Pudding is very important but then they didn't show how she wrapped it.
I was about to close you tube but then this video came in front of my eyes on the time line.
I was like oh my god finally
What dishes pass as "pudding",...  XD
I live in the U.S. and am not familiar with beef suet.  I can find it on amazon however it is called "shredded beef suet".  Mrs. Crocombe's suet looks like small pebbles.  Would the shredded suet work the same way?
Always a delight to watch your’e Amazing  videos ! You are a Character  ! A smart investor ... should make a regular  t.v show ! A New program is desperately in need ! Keep it up you  are so unique and special ! 👍!
Those fingernails?! The real Mrs Crocombe would NEVER!
plenty of flAwer(constrict throat on the A sound) lolol
Do English breakfast
HER LOOK AT 4:15 I CANT 😂
Cooking with Mrs Crocombe - new Netflix series PLEASE
I love the look Mrs Crocombe gave after saying Dead Man's Leg! Hilarious and subtle! XD
She should have a own chanal for cooking 😍❤💕
日本語字幕が欲しい…
This channel is AMAZING!!! Why isn’t it a TV show yet?
As of today whenever I take a break and someone sees me, I’m going to say “you caught me having five minutes”
The 4:15 look. I've decided to take a screenshot, get it printed off, the laminate the picture. Then I'm going to pin it up in my kitchen.
If my wife ever tries to use packet custard and tinned fruit in a trifle, or DARES to call Roly-Poly Pudding, 'DEAD MAN'S LEG,' I'll point to the laminated picture of the 4:15 look while gently shaking my head.
Why not to bake it? I think that would be more logically.
Ms. C!!! Oh how we missed you! Queen of the Kitchen 😋👑
I was confused for a bit because a roly poly is a pill bug where I'm from; glad you didn't make a pudding from a bunch of those.
Im so gonna have to try some of her recipies they sound so good!
Mary-Anne really is the real MVP
Whoever came up with the idea of Mrs Crocombe's videos: THANK YOU! I hope you got a life pension out of this ;)
HORAYYYYYYYY. You are back and I am soooooooo glad.
Excuse my lack of knowledge but what is suet?
This is like Vietnamese bánh tét in that you tightly wrap meat or beans in gluttonous rice.
Its been a long time .... Watching u here mam...! Missed u and ur voice a lot..!😍
This really brought Beatrix Potter to life for me. Poor Tom Kitten!
Mrs Crocombe invented cooking.
Perhaps those British servants had much more calories from a meal  than i have a day...
"I knew it was roly poly pudding because she only had one stocking on"  -benny hill
I can see now why life expectancy in the Victorian age was low. "You could fry it in butter, but to make it more delicious, take this package of suet, bacon, flour and whatnot and fry it in lard. Mmmm...."
Gotta say that as an American reading the title I was sure some poor guy was low enough on the totem pole that his job was picking roly polies off the sidewalk until there were enough to cook with.
The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding
"Dead man's leg" Looks at the camera like in an episode of The Office
I didn't even know that pudding could be savory. xD It looks good though, I might try it (without the mushrooms though as I hate mushrooms).
Love you so much❤️ you’re an amazing cook, I wish I could work with you lol!
Yay! She is back!😳
Thank you sooooo much. My gram used to make this but I had no idea how it was made! Since my parents had split up, I didn't get to see her as much. Just frequent phone conversations. I remember this as a child, her pulling this out for breakfast and frying it. Now I need to figure out what beef suet is lol. And Cinderella had the nursery rhyme she used to hum to me! Life is great when you can find those wonderful memories from childhood!!
"a generous PINCH of salt" proceeds to chuck a near handful into the mix
Yooo I didn’t know this series is still going 😭I’m so happy! I thought it was just an old video I didn’t watch (since I watched all of the others)❤️
Everything is perfect here! Love the short films ❤️👌
0:55 It seems like the Punisher just got punished
Thank you E.H. for another Avis video, these are my favourite thing! And Mrs Hipperson is simply divine as Avis, that look at 4:13! XD I keep replaying it, she's hilarious.
Dang...homegirl is kind of built!
The only thing more delightful than the sight of that pudding was Mrs Crocombe's disapproving look for the dead man's leg name...
The quality of these videos gets more exceptional with ever new one! Mrs. Corcombe was hilarious with her sassy look at the thought of calling a pudding "Dead man's leg"! Her actress is so talented, I look forward to every new episode! Keep up the amazing work!
"Dead mans Leg"- Those brows mean business
Wonderful video! And the cinematography is absolutely awesome!
4:15 but not in this house you won't!
Everyone make sure not to skip the ads so Mrs. Crocombe gets full ad revenue ♡♡♡
Man, there is seriously something wrong with people. It’s insane to me that people back then truly believed stuff like “it doesn’t matter how it looks, this is for the servants.”

There is absolutely no way in heck that I would EVER serve someone like that with the mentality that they are somehow worth more or more important than me because of how much money they have.

I know this is acting, but people back then truly believed this stuff, some even still do.

The rich would convince them that they should be proud and that it was an accomplishment to serve them. Pretty sick honestly.

As far as I am concerned, the man who literally cleaned up human excrement is just as important and worth just as much as the Kings and queens of England.
I want that oval shaped copper pot! I would be all about boiling the roly poly if I had such a perfect pot for the task. As I do not, any ideas if using cheesecloth and a dutch oven would work?
I simply must make this myself one day. I bet it is nothing short of heavenly when fried!
I love these video's! More please.
@4:15 i can hear the jingle of wedding bands being showered upon her
Cholestrol City!
Heart burn on a plate for me unfortunately. I remember my mam making this with tinned steak and leeks
Seriously, who on earth came out with the name "dead man's leg" for that delicious food!?
I'd love to hear how this tastes. Has anyone here tried this recipe please?
I just found these today and despite probably never attempting to try most of these I can't help but watch love this!
Looks lovely but would fry the bacon first
I loved the look after she said "dead man's leg" gave it the subtext of "but not in my kitchen "
I was just binge watching all your videos this morning!!
Watching this series gives me the same amount of joy that Studio Ghibli movies and other Jane Austen movies provide.
Yasss Mrs Crocombe is back!!
I LOVE the videos! Please keep making more!
Lard!  Makes everything taste good!
I love this channel so much! I though you guys stopped!
I thought it said Holy Moly.....
Since when In England has camera at 1830s ???
Why Bronte Sisters looks old???
I just love listening to her voice 😍😍 and oof.. I wanna try some of the dishes that she had made 😭😭
Oh Thank you!  Ms. Crocombe is back!!!!
Yes so happy for another video!! And her look after the dead man's leg comment was gold!
Shirt sleeve pudding...Now I know what to do with a old shirt :D But seriously, I know now how to make a nice puff pastry, savoury :D
Honestly I'm going to try my hand at this recipe
Looks like an excellent way to use up leftovers.  For the pastry, would butter work if I can’t get any suet?
Why is everything a pudding.  And why boil things u can bake?
AGORA SEI DE ONDE VEIO A PALAVRA "ROCAMBOLE" :O

there's a very known sweet here in Brasil called Rocambole.... the noun is similar to roly poly... but is sweet and is baked.... filled with jelly. There are some versions made with meat.
That looks amazing (minus the mushrooms).  The diet I've been on for the last 3 months doesn't permit bread.  It's making me drool!
Like first then watch shows 🥰
Someone served this to me once and called it a bacon badger. I really didn't like it 😞
Please Can you make Yorkshire Pudding?😊
Lovely! Even as a vegan, I enjoy watching Mrs Crocombe!
that look at "dead man's leg", lol perfect. I basically made the 😕 face to that name. smh.
I don't know when she became a gay icon but we stan a legend.
yess, omg I love these videos! :)
This was one of the first puddings I made at school 40 years ago . I made jam roll polly pudding and it went rock hard lol
Whats a good substitute for the beef suet? Butter or lard??
"You caught me having 5 minutes-"
R e l a t a b l e
So, it's like a calzone. 😁 I'm trying this one!
I love these videos but one thing makes me really sad
There is no life ...only her voice
This makes me feel sad thinking that those times dissapeared while I am watching the video which is supposed to be alive 
My mind is in contradictory 
If someone understands my feelings
The video will be so much better with some human noises, people talking  or something like that. 
Sorry for my English 
I love these videos so much ^^
If this is Victorian then emvsn we have the measurements in imperial too please? (I can't work metric :-))
4:15 Naughty girl, huh?
Maybe this was servants' food, but to me, this looks delicious and something my (not-so-refined) tastebuds would probably prefer more than certain dishes made for Lord & Lady Braybrooke -- for example, the curry.  Nevertheless, I'm so happy to have Mrs Crocombe back for a new video. Yay!
Ah, I'd been waiting for a new upload, then I'm a week late?!
I'm 6 foot 3 270lbs but I know if Mrs Crocombe raised an eyebrow at me I'd look at the floor and start fidgeting.
OMG I MISSED YOUUUUUU ❤❤
I know what im eating tonight!
4:13 has me giggling like mad.
That shady look like saying "really queen?"
4:15 THAT LOOK 😂
'Ere now! Wots all dis, then?! Another wonderful video by English Heritage, innit?
Yay! She’s back!
Yes!!!! ❤️love this content
I missed you Mrs Crocombe!!!
Mrs. Crocombe: H-
YouTube commenters: OH wOw Mrs. Crocombe ThRoWiNg SHADE! Work sis mama yes gawd!
They should upload more often!
0:49 When your "generous pinch" is an infinite stream of salt.
I love you ❤️ from Kuwait 🇰🇼
I absolutely love these videos.  Thank you .
I was missing these, so glad to see a new one pop up on my feed!! \o/
Mrs Crocombe and Shane Dawson collab woul be so weirdly fascinating my brain would explode lol
4:12 I ACTUALLY FELT SCARED
This is a posh version. Mushrooms? Fried in lard?
Calling it dead man's leg? That's a paddling.
I wish she had her own cooking channel 😭
Hurray! Our favorite English Lady!
I adore the woman who plays Mrs. Crocombe in these videos.
Haha "dead mans leg" NOPE!
Yummy love this programme <3
Mrs Crocombe ate a man's leg and the bones
when mom heard you say a bad word and you know you're gonna get it 4:14
The side eye thrown at dead mans leg is probably what killed it 😂😂
Ugh my day is complete😍
That looks like a handful of salt not a pinch
i love this woman!
When she tasted the pudding. I literally salivate!
I missed these with all my heart
Am i the only one that wants Mrs Crocombe merch?😂 like Shirts or aprins with some of her best/most sassy sayings💕
What a delightful surprise, mrs Crocombe
Missed you Mrs Crocombe!
My Nan used to make Marmalade Roly Poly
kennedy the elderly your
The view counts on all the Mrs. Crocombe videos or so much higher then all their other videos. We need more!
This is the purest thing on youtube.
We have fundamentally different understandings of the term pudding.
I learned too much from your videos 😍😍😍
i binge watch all of these they're awesome
Every time I hear the word "pudding" I'm waiting for something that is thick, creamy and sweet and has to be eaten with a spoon 😋😋😋
Someone veganize this. Please!
I think I would try this...lard and all.  :)
I really enjoy watching these videos.
I loveeeeee her!!!!!
4:14 i love how she just looks at the camera like " you know why" xD
Hii im sofia...from indonesia...im glad to see u back,mrs cocombre
I thought onions were associated with the poor
4:15 😁
That is good quality bacon! It's thick and has a healthy pink color. Looks way more appetizing than store bought bacon.....
She always looks very proud lol.
Isn't this just Dead Man's Leg?
My mother used to make them with blackberries as the filling. Delicious and filling. Put a bit of sugar and some whipped cream on top.
Suet, bacon and lard... These are the secret ingredients.
I love these videos so much
Didn't know T-ARA cooked
The servants certainly are better than the lords
I thought the pudding was for the servants lol 😂😂😂 that’s what she said
4:15)))) You are amazing)))
I missed you.....
I LOVE YOU MRS CROCOMBEE
4:15 my Asian mom when i said i have bf when i was 16
One of those dishes that is no doubt absolutely delicious, but really requires you to have a 10-14 hours physical working day if you aren't to pile on the pounds!
Are those standing crust molds in the background? Can you show us how to use them?
That’s a PUDDING?!?!
Give this lady an award! She's absolutely brilliant! What a find, English Heritage... :)
My favorite filling for this is kitten!
Yay a new episode!  Please keep them coming!  This made my day!
Back off! Townsends belongs on the throne!
I actually need to make this! Yumm
Mrs Crocombe seems to have polished her copper utensils. The kitchen looks vibrant and different.
Why is it called pudding?
Love the music intro
Yessss!!! Love it 😄
4:14 when your teacher gives you that look after forgetting homework
"Ive even heard people call it dead mans leg" 👀
There goes poor Mrs Crocombe talking to her future friends again.
This is therapy for me. Please never stop making these.
Yassss queen!!!
What is suet? That's what I give my birds! What do you use instead in modern-day times like now
Yeay Mrs Crocombe 🙌🏼😍🙌🏼
i dont understand at all how british people define pudding
Maryanne, sous chef supreme!
I love her so much 💕💕💕
NO MUSIC!!
I always wondered what this was, when I saw it in one of the Beatrix Potter tales.
Yummy!
I covet your copper!
This is so satisfying and relaxing to watch who agrees???
Hum, pastry made with suet, filed with bacon and fried in lard... It's a miracle it doesn't oinc! when it goes to the table.
I wish the real Mrs. Crocombe would know how popular she is 100 years after her death.
yum!
That looks good!😳😁👍
Ok, I'm sure it's delicious (ahem) and all, but I got sick watching it be prepared.  Boiled dough and meat? I guess it's a dumpling type food, and I never DID like dumplings. Ah, well, to each their own.
For some reason, that slo-mo shot with the cold water made it looks SO refreshing. It looks like it’s the best water you’ll ever drink
I think this is the first time I've seen her eat something she prepares! So glad to see another video of her
Sounds divine! I sure love these segments.
Nice to see you back. Yeah!!! 😊👋👋👋🎉
4:14 😂😂😂 oh lighten up you silly old hen!
You don't know how relieved I am to discover there are no actual 'rolly polly's' in this dish. Phew!
5:38 That's like slices of garlic bread 😅
The music in these videos is so soothing, so is the crackling stove
You're so cute I'm gonna die!!! 😍
I love these videos because it feels so personal like I’m in the kitchen with her, almost like I went through a time machine to watch Mrs. Crocombe cook. So educational and lovely.
love this!!
I lost ot when she had that look after she said "dead mans leg"
I have to say that it does eventually look like dead man's leg.  I cannot imagine the health implications of a heavy suet pastry containing streaky bacon and then fried in lard.  I suppose that afterwards, all the men would have been outside ploughing fields, and the women occupied in heavy manual work too.  
I love Mrs Crocombe, and her look after "dead man's leg" is indeed priceless!  
However, make a cherry or plum jam roly-poly - steamed rather than boiled - and add a little baking powder in with the flour.  Serve with homemade custard.  Enough to bring sunshine into the very coldest winter day...
VICTORIANS CALL ANYTHING A PUDDING!
I was very concerned when I first read the title, where I live, a “Roly Poly” is a woodlouse. I was like “Oh god, I hope this has nothing to do with roly polies...”
Laugh out loud when shw said Dead Man's Leg and the look she gave.  Priceless.
I missed her!!! I love watching her and her way to speak!
That LOOK.  You all know which one.
Ewwww!!! All that bacon and lard...🤢🤮
5:30 I paused at the wrong time, didn't I?
That look! I got you, Mrs. Crocombe. I got you. Lol
Loving these "The Victorian Way" videos. Mrs Crocombe makes it look so easy.
Love this channel and have subscribed, keep em coming--however if you are watching the old cholesterol levels like I and many millions are --then these recipes could have you pushing up the daisies faster than Usain Bolts trainers. Victorians must have had stomachs of iron.
This actually looks pretty yummy!  Not really sure why it’s called pudding but hey!
Ok what is with boiling all that good pastry? Just why?
Now I'm wanting to try this but without the mushrooms
Sounds like a delicious heart attack in a portion! Also, I swear that they sell those white bowls with the blue rim she uses to hold the ingredients in Sainsbury's. Am I right?
You could serve it hot? But how would you unwrap it? It's a soggy lump of dough. Am I doing something wrong?
ohhhh ok it's sorta like polenta, except not as good
Isn't roly poly pudding what Tom Kitten nearly got baked into in the Beatrix Potter books? I don't know... it's a weird childhood memory this is bringing back to me!
Always gotta remember that the definition of a pudding in history is about as loose as a prolapsed anus
I’ve watched most of her videos and this is the only one that looks appetizing to me. I guess I was a servant in my past life.
I wish I had a Maryanne to do all my prep work for me!
More recipes please. We love them!!
Oi luff yooo Mrs Crocombe. 😍
MARY ANNE... has already prepared my ingredients.
I love all the Mrs. Crocombe stans
Does anyone remember roly poly pudding from Beatrix Potter's book The Tale of Samuel Whiskers? I'm from a different country so I've always wondered what a proper roly poly pudding looks like.
“dead man’s leg.” 👀
.Before I watch the video, I hope this does not contain the roly-poly
This one might be my favorite. Her acting is top notch here and it’s inviting, warm, and informative!!!
Wow this is so interesting, oh wait English Cooking!? No thank you!
english heritage? 700grammes and why isn't the cook a pakistani?   lol
that DEAD MAN'S LEG STARE tho
All of the individual dishes bug me. This could have been a one baking bowl thing
Stepped up dat production quality
Could you use the 21st century ready made just roll pastry?
She gave us some stern side eye about that dead man's leg situation.
Love the look after you said dead man's leg
<3 <3
The people who called it ‘Dead Man’s Leg’ must’ve been very edgy Victorians! I always want to do these puddings, but I wonder if steaming it would work well as a replacement of wrapping it in cloth.
WHY DOSE THIS REMINDS ME OF NANNY MCPHEE !!!!
I need to make this for breakfast... yum
Hard for me to think of this as "pudding" tho.  Looks like it would be good.
I really like her!
4:15 best part!!! hahaha
Well i learned one thing today: "a good pinch" = a handful of salt
Queeeeeeeeen 😍
She cracks me up really. "You caught me having 5 minutes"
No seasoning lol
these videos are so precious
Be sure to always put a Pinky up while eating that, cuz dats Fancy 👑💕
4:13 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I've been tempted to try and make an English pudding for a few years now. I think I'll try this one :)
this is the first time ive seen her eat what she cooked
Dead man's leg ......




Eeeks ... evil eye !!!!!
I miss her!!  💟 and her lovely voice and her cooking wares 💟💟💟
Suet?
Even the servants food is lit
Mrs. Crocombe I miss you!!
"Dead man's leg", then looks at the viewer and dares them to laugh!
This looks very delicious! May I have a bite? 😄😋
I really hope at some point they reveal that mrs crocombe has some mental issues talking to her hallucinations.
I wonder how many servants in the Victorian era died or became very ill because their roly poly pudding was kept at the back of the range?
SHE CALMS MY SOULLL
Who tasted this pudding?
Victorians really out here calling anything a pudding, huh?
Whenever I see that video come up in my subscribed feed, I am overjoyed that Mrs Crocombe can teach me the ways of an orgasmic Victorian pudding. Thank you ma’am <3
My family have been making this for generations, we always called it bacon pudding. My nan made the best! Ive never seen anyone make it outside of our family so its wonderful to see this video. Brings back tons of fond memories.
It looks and sounds wonderful. Really stick to your ribs stuff.
"Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner."
This shades against servants are gold
Gawd that looks delicious!  🤗
I love these videos so much! Welcome back!
The side eye snatched my wig
In Germany you can hardly  buy beef suet.  What shall I use  instead?
I LOOOOOOVE your accent ♥
4:14 wyd when your girl look at you dis was
How unusual. Never heard of this before.
please never stop with these videos 😊
“Pinch of salt”  = grabs handful of salt and tosses it in!
Roly Poly has jam in it...
Roly poly ～ roly roly poly～🎵
more mrs crocombe! love her
Very interesting, but I wonder if it would turn out better baked vs. boiled & then fried.
“You caught me having 5 minuets” 😂
The way she looked at The camera at 4;15 XD lel
Really thought she was going to put roly poly pill bugs into it.
PUDDING?????
YEHEY!!!!
.. Her accent has changed! Yummy recipe, must give this a go.
Yas!!! You are back!!!
Our QUEEN is back!
Made this last weekend for my Birthday.  We did alter the stuffing though. we used ground bison, baby portobello mushrooms, onions, green and red peppers. OMG it was just SOOOO Yummy! Thanks so much for making my birthday just a bit more special, if you were only there in my heart while cooking!
Ima make this for my servants.... me!
I don't even eat meat but I like all her videos. I just love to cook
The look after she said dead man's leg killed me😂😂😂
That side eye was everything 😂
MRS CROCOMMBEEEE!!!
4:14 that awkward moment 🤣🤣🤣😂😂

NO Salt!
Yay! I love her videos
MaRiAnNe

What is the U.S. Substitution for the UK bacon?,
hmm I don't have any mushrooms or bacon, but I do have a mischievous stray kitten, I'm sure he shall do
miss ya Mrs.Crocombe!
I'm gonna need that "dead man's leg" look as a gif.
That’s not even a pudding...wtf
Love you!!!!!
Her mixing bowls are the bowls that all primary schools had
Need more of her videos 😭😭😭
thats a nice teacup, where did you all get it?

Waw good like ♡
THE SHADE SHE THREW
Someone heard an echo while she was speaking?
The Moment when you watch the Video and wait for the Pudding. In Germany Puddings are Desserts 😅
That stare 4:14
I see Mrs Crocombe, i click like
I love these videos ❤️❤️❤️
This is one of the first things that has looked actually reaaaally good
First you need a naughty kitten, named Tom.
4:09 "I've even heard of it called Dead Man's Leg.
...
...
...
...
>:/

"
She's not lying about the lard. If you want amazing fried chicken, use lard. Don't use oil. Trust me, you won't regret it. (My maternal grandmother used lard. Best fried chicken ever)
Mrs. Crocombe! 💞
This would be a cool show on the Food network. They're always looking for new ideas well here you go
I love this woman👏🏻
I looove you!!!
Mrs. Crocombe needs her own show
japalohimo
4:15 that look lol. Priceless
Liked the video before watching it hhhh
비주얼이 영국음식 삘....
good to see you again finally :) hello Mrs Crocombe fans! :):)
Yey!!!
We all need to start a petition to the BBC to have her appear in the next season of Victoria!
Glad you are back.
she tried it!! She tasted it!!! i'm so happy for her!!! i wonder what it tastes like
😂 she so shady 😍
I’ve always wanted to know what roly poly pudding is supposed to look like, it actually looks tasty after it’s fried off in the pan
awww Mrs. Crocombe...I have such affection for you as you never fail to make me grin from ear-to-ear...  : )
    Can someone help me...How does the "Roly Poly" outer crust firm up after being *boiled*???  What keeps it from turning gummy or sticky???
I want this woman to dominate me and scold me for my skills till I get it right
I think the servants ate better than the rich people lol xD
I know of this pudding only from Beatrix Potter’s story “The Roly-Poly Pudding,” also known as “The Tale of Samuel Whiskers.”  It was quite a frightening story for me as a child.
What are the units in ounces please? It's hard;y victorian without and I only have ounce measures at home.
bro q asko eskereeeee
legend
So happy to see this in my feed!!
That looks kinda good tho
That is disgusting, but glad you liked it! <3
A dish with 3 kinds of fat....my kind of cooking.
Heart attack pudding
My nan taught me how to make Roly Poly Pudding (both the sweet and savoury kinds) and I haven't had it in ages! Guess what I'll be cooking up in the next few weeks! You can fill them with just about anything but our family favourites were either sausage meat, sage and onion or Sunday roast left overs (including left over roast and green veggies and topped with any gravy left over from Sunday roast) for savoury and jam Roly Poly with warm custard or sweet white sauce for a dessert one.
I've been diagnosed coeliac so I'll be trying it with gluten free flour so I'm not sure how it will turn out, but here's hoping. I may try adding an egg to the pastry (my nan sometimes did that anyway for "extra goodness") to help bind it and see how that goes.
Looks awesome, I must try it.
I hope this channel have english sub.
That's not a pudding. That's a burrito.
Great show
Sounds delicious, but in todays prices using that much bacon is quite a luxury hehehe
ooo mmm😋
Mrs Crocombe, Please can you do an episode of how to make Victorian milk bread , I love your program
Absolutely love her!
Why is this called a pudding?
Very A.S.M.R
Yaaaas we stan a victorian kitchen queen 👑👑👑
That look...ouch!
I luv this 🌷
Finally! :)
“IF YOU DON’T EAT YOUR MEAT, YOU CAN’T HAVE ANY PUDDING! HOW CAN YOU HAVE ANY PUDDING IF YOU DON’T EAT YOUR MEAT?” Roger Waters would approve - the pudding HAS the meat. David Gilmore would not care either way.
👏👏👏👏👏😉
If you were to make this recipie today with modern ingredients, what could the suet be replaced with? Also can you still buy lard?
Finally, she gets a bite of what she worked so hard for 😁
Dead man's leg look kill me
2:20 MARY ANN!!!!
Wish these were a tad bit longer! Oh! CHRISTMAS!!!
Yessssssss!!!!!! Finally!!!!!
None of that "dead mans leg" foolishness, I see...
That look at 4:15 😂
4:15 okay that was creepy
I adore these videos.
Roly poly roly roly poly :U
Dead man's leg!
I feel like the word "pudding" has no meaning in England XD;;; It's a word for desserts... or for anything else basically? XD;;;; Anyways, thanks for another lovely video, Mrs. Crocombe~ ^.^
I looove her, I looooove this video 💕
I'm confused.  In the US, pudding is a soft dessert made with milk and flavored with chocolate, vanilla or whatever you like.  In England, they seem to refer to any dessert as a pudding.  I've heard people ask, "What are we having for pudding?"  That's funny to me, because it's like asking, "What are we having for chicken?"  Now here's another pudding, and it's savory!  I give up.  What, exactly, is a pudding on your side of the pond?
So you steam this then?
4:14 The face you make when your friend gets TOO close to mentioning something you told them not to mention
What kind of cloth is used to wrap it in? Could you use cheesecloth?
Great video and pudding... Yum
4:15 DAMNNNN! The sassssss!!!! Mrs Crocombe!!!
i am way too excited it’s back!
I love these videos
Lard?? Suet??? What are those?
Today I’ll show you how to make a roly roly roly roly
I just want a roly roly roly
“mMm sMeLlS dEvInE”
Aweee i love her
I am binged watching this
Giggles "mom whats for dinner"? Dead man's leg, go wash your hands! 😋👀
I love this channel!
I am not sure I could eat that, but it was lovely watching it being made
Where is her accent from? Her "R" sound almost Irish?...
Yayks! A dead man's leg😂
Not my type 😷😵😱🤧
4:15 that shade though
Dead mans leg.... She don’t play that!!
Has anyone ever tried these recipes?
So nice to see you again!
Why is it called a pudding!?
mooooooooore
Omg a new video!!!! yaaaaay 😍😍
Suet, not just for birds.
Those eyes after “dead man’s leg” like yeah, I’ve heard that name before...but not in my kitchen...
"I've even heard it called 'Dead Man's Leg'." looks straight at the camera and raises a disapproving eyebrow
Why it called Pudding?
No salt pepper
Am I the only one to think that the actress is great as usual but the cinematography as weakened considerably in this video? Please keep this channel's good quality up!
It looks really good though
She forgot the kitten
4:13  dead man's leg😂😂
Very similar to german  Maultaschen
fry dumpling
What's a suet? I tranlated the word but.. I'm not sure what it is exactly
Mel C lol 😂
OMG almost Christmas!
omg when did she start eating the food she makes? This is awesome.
damn mrs.crocombe, the dead mans leg 😂😂😂😂
I loveee her accent!!!
that looks really good i might make it
Wouldn’t you love to have all the lovely bowls , tins and pots she has.  Of course , you would want to have a kitchen maid to keep all that copper shiny.
Brilliant ... Just a silly question though does it mean that the wrapped up stuff needs to be immersed in the boiling water , still boiling further on stove for an hour n half ..I hope I have got this right ..
Bc I'm American, I thought BC it says pudding in the title that it would be like a dessert. Chocolate or vanilla. Not onions and mushrooms. Guess there puddings are different.
Yeeees!
This does look quite tasty. Does anyone else here still use butter, lard and suet to cook? I do!
Hello!! We missed you!!
I feel like this roleplaying is someone's fetish
4:13 don't ask me why
I love this lady
A pudding?
Loove her So much!!!
Mrs Crocombe was probably on the trip to the USA, because she has more american accent now and sun tan too :)
Maryanne is deaf!
“Dead mans leg”  👀
I love her♡
Where does one find beef suet?
ok this woman needs her own show, like cmon wtf is taking yall so long???
She seems nicer and happier in this one
Loved the look you gave us with the dead man's leg...like this will never be called dead man's leg in this house!
4:15 That look though.
I want her to scold me everyday. I don't know why
4:15 "old man's leg? Really?
yaaaas queeen!
I need this in spanish, pleaaaseeee
finally i saw mrs crocomber eat what she made. so i will die in peace
I live for these videos! I love her!
I thought she was calling Maryann when she yelled her name.  But I love her.
How is this a pudding?
HEr face when she says "dead man's leg" is like the face of the turkey sticker in facebook messenger.
She’s back!!!
She’s back!!!
Lol that generous pinch of salt went on forever
i need a gif of 4:14 !!!!
I lik it 😍
YES IT'S MY GIRL CROCOMBE
Snoopy happy dance!
That look she gave after she said “dead mans leg”. Lol
I missed her sooo much
Why boil, and not bake it?
Someone give Mrs Crocombe an Oscar
Can this be incorporated into a low-fat diet?
💓💓
What a great dish! I may have to make this one.
this is a pudding??
I love these videos
Where would I find beef suet in America?
I love this!
Step one: Have a will to live.
Love love love these videos!
What exactly qualifies something as pudding?
Just love her
4:14 we love a sassy Queen 💕💕💕💕💕
Now how does that dead man's leg taste?? 😁😁😁😂😂😂
English pastry is so bland .
This woman gives me life
4:15. that look was like.... WILL NOT STAND!!. "Dead man's leg", pff RUBISH!!! XD !!!
I bet my husband would love this!
A tasty supper dish x
I love her.
This is the one food from this series that is really making my mouth water. Like, I NEED to try this.
Something heartwarming about Mrs Crocombe preparing a dish she has fond childhood memories of.
I love how dishes for slaves and poor people are now used and served in expensive restaurants ect
Wonderful video,thanks.
dead man's leg?...👀
yeah I like how she made it obvious she didn't like calling that dead man's leg, with a disapproving look. Which she held. Then deepened the disapproving look by inclining her head even more and raising an eyebrow. hilarious. I felt the same way though.
Nasty shi*
i’m quaking rn
Anyone tried making this? How did it taste?
After seeing a couple of her pudding recipes, I'm really starting to question the definition of "pudding"....
MARIANNE
ok i got no idea what pudding means now.........
I love these! But that didn't look like it would feed many servants?
It's a hot pocket
You call that pudding?
idk shes kinda hot ..  :)
Her expression after she said dead man's leg hahahah
Hey EH, I'm not a native English speaker, what does "at the back of the range" mean in cooking context?
It have 🥓. Like.
😘😘😘
I have learned that I have no idea of what constitutes a pudding.
Mrs Crocombe reminds me a lot of my old cookery teacher, Mrs Adams, from high school. And she was one of my favourite teachers!
Wonder how it taste, cus the idea of boiling my bacon in plain water seems weird to me
What's suet?
What is a suet?
Finally!
Dead man's leg fried in lard, not a British pudding I will be trying anytime soon.
that look
Excellent
I just found this series and I’m addicted,
Note to self: do NOT refer to Roly-poly pudding as 'Dead man's leg' if visiting Audley End House 😬
That looks bomb
I'm sure they cared a lot about the calories ,sugar,fat,carbs back then.. lol
Mrs C is hot!
4:15 that look xDDD she know what's up
How deep is the boiling water. Is it immersed?
Love it !!!!
i have a question is this house privatly owned or is it still subject to the crown estate?
Good old white times
Anyone else catch that shade when she mentioned Dead Man's leg?😒😒😒😒
She is back....😊😊😊
I wonder if roly-polies are any good to eat.. I mean, they ARE crustaceans.
Yay!
Pudding?
whats a Suet?
Suet pastry with bacon filling fried in lard? My cholesterol spiked up just watching this video. Must be good, though.
This meal is so ridiculous. I love it.
I watch these videos again and again and again and again and again...
I love this!
This may be my favorite English Heritage video, the acting is so fluid, from the “caught me having 5 minutes” to the “dead man’s leg” bit.
Brava!
They deep fried food in the Victorian era?
Now we knew what Tom Kitten would have ended up...
For the love of God, give this woman her own tv show ! 💋🇧🇷💋
Oh woow
So suet (animal fat) and then you use lard (more animal fat) mmm Lol
Who? Marion she said
Am I the only one who finds her videos sooooo soothing
Could we replace the suet by some butter ? Or what else ? She doesn't use the totality of the mushrooms and of the bacon, yet she could and should have done it: there is mostly dough. The way to cook is surprising. It looks so weird after having boiled.
Yum!
The side eye at 4:15.
Is it just me or does much of the poor people food look tastier than the wealthy people food on this channel?
Wow, this actually reminds me of my country's "bánh tét". Except the dough is sticky rice, and the filling is pork and mung beans. And yes, I like to fry it.
Like if you want to see a collab with Mrs Crocome, Townsends, and Grandpa Kitchen!!!
What's ''suet''?
we stan a cooking queen who can dish out sassy looks
Tasty
What's a suet?
I wouldn't dare call this dish "dead man's leg" in her presence.
Whoever filmed this doesn't realize how important it is to see the exact way she does this with her hands. Seeing her face is what they seem to think was the important part. Wrong.
im so happy she's back
I’m curious , what makes this “pudding”?
4:14 GAHDGAVDGAVDSGAHDBAGSHDGA
She actually tasted this one, cause she wasn’t serving it lol
I wonder where they find the suet. I have never seen that in any grocery store in my life.
Very nice  !Thanks 😊 💜 💜 💜
Thank you Mrs. Crocombe,  some English dishes are disgusting.
This looks divine! We don't have anything like this where I live in America.
I laughed when Mrs Crocrombe gave a look at Dead mans leg. A proper woman, ahahaha
I love her!!
Amazing!  Looks yummy!
Looks like a good breakfast food
That look nasty af
Shes boujee
That look at 4:14... someone needs to make a meme with it.
Lovely.
can i use butter instead of suet?
This looks delicious
Can something else be used instead of lard ? Like butter maybe ? Because I don’t think I can find the other thing
Awesome
I'd call it dead mans leg looks more like it then a pudding
Jesus... Why.. why. Why boil flour pie? Thank god she fried it
Boiled and then fried dough? Yeesh, I understand why the French mock English cuisine now....
I’m so hungry right now!
This just popped up in my recommendations, so I'm very new... but her accent sounds American imitating a British accent. Is this right?
HECK YEAH AVISSSSSSS
Alright  youtube,  I'm watching it
I’m screaming!!! She’s baaack
Do u guys realize what you have in your hands with Mrs Crocombe? Everything she touches right now will turn to gold!!
Hello Mrs.Crocombre... I'm glad for your new video. I thought pudding have to be sweet, but I just learnt something today. By the way, the roly poly pudding is reminded me one of traditional dish in a province of my country, Indonesia, which is called Pempek. It's a dish that made of tapioca flour and fish. Instead of bacon, the filling of pempek is whole egg and you eat pempek with the condiment that called cuko. I'm happy to see this dish. I thought  I only can find similar food in China, because the origin of this food was made by Chinese uncle (pek/apek) that became Indonesian and sold the dish. ' cause of the seller was called pek...apek so the dish simply called pempek😁 
I would be such a happy kid if I had an auntie like Mrs Crocrombe. I sure would be around in the kitchen helping her all day 💕
This sounds like a comfort food.
Why is this so addicting to watch
Who is this lady? Where did she come from? Is she an actress? SHE. IS. FABULOUS.
Ignorant American here... what's suet?
What is a suet?
Aqui no Brasil, se alguem falar que vai cozinhar para a coroa, vão pensar que esta cozinhando para uma mulher mais velha(serio isso). #BR
We call that a burrito (flour) or tamale (corn husk) in South Texas and Mexico.  With a slight variance, of course. Our yummy is steamed, not boiled.  Boy! Is it good.  Can't wait to make this dish.  One would think with all the beef herds in Texas,  suet would be available anywhere.  Not so. Dead man's leg......um.... not so tempting.
Who else thought she was gonna put actual “roly polys” in the thing? (Mainly us Americans lol)
Can I replace the lard with butter to make the pastry for the pudding?
4:13 for the best mom look ever. No one would ever cross a woman who can give a look like this. I'm now off to practice it.
Opa! Victorian Babushka's cheburek!
Mrs. Crocombe, I have an old cookbook from the Victorian era that specializes in chocolate recipes. My particular favorite recipe is a chocolate filling that I use to make simple chocolate pies with. Could you possibly do a video on how to make a good Victorian chocolate pie? Mine are ok, but they always end up sunken in. Not sure If I am interpreting the recipe properly. I’m sure you could do a much better job.
That looks really appetising, oddly enough
now that i would eat........
Dead man's leg ..... stare
So freaking happy I don’t eat that sickness. Or that cow breast milk. Life is so much better vegan/plant based!!!  I still love watching these older shows. Comforting!
Is this the poor’s food?
i don't know who are you is first time when i see you  on youtube but why do you cook on all them cooper pots? is toxic and deadly ....
shes baccckkkkk!
Who be the seven naysayers?
What does she wrap it in? Is it muslin?
Has anyone made this?
I’m gonna pretend that I know what suet is!
Mmmmmmm baconnnnnnn!
I looks like the life of a servant in a great house was absolutely awful. Just work from sun up to sundown jeez
Midnight and I’m making myself hungrier... nothing will come of this, surely.
I guess i didnt know what exactly classifies as  "pudding"
Isn't suet just straight up fat? I didn't know you could make pastry with it. This recipe is probably VERY high in calories if you're watching your figure.
Who knew? The Victorians invented the burrito!!   Or it would be if she wrapped the ingredients in a corn flour based bread instead of wheat flour.
Yo anyone try this? it looks pretty good
I'm sorry, but this looks disgusting.
wtf
Looks delicious but it's no wonder life expectancy was so short back then between disease, suet and lard you can understand why
Sounds and looks revolting. But hey you gotta try it... I guess.
Now I want ssssoooomeeeee!! And what is suet??
Looks like an omelette with dough instead of egg.
@English Heritage - do you know what the chocolate Mrs C uses in various videos (packaged in faux Victorian packaging as “M Jeffries Rock Chocolate” - no such thing has ever existed) e.g. chocolate pudding actually is? As in what 21st century product is being used? It looks v unusual in texture and I’m curious!
Victorian England is very misleading! Here, I was expecting a sweet dessert, but instead, I got a savoury dish :/
What is beef suet?
I don't get it, why not just bake it??
Can someone please explain to me why does the actress pronounce  “water” that way?
I'm not a native speaker but I've alway found the british accent delightful and the way Mrs Crocombe pronounce the word “water”in this episode reallly intrigues me. 
It sounds quite strong almost like american accent. It has to do something with the time period or status she has?
Does anyone actually cook these at home? Are they as great as they look?
The look she gives after dead man’s leg  like, “those people are wrong”
How is possible it to have so many visits, likes and comments after less than 24h?
What is suet?
Why was she pouring water from a pitcher into yet another pitcher
Sounds gross
I'm no one to judge Victorian "Dead Man's Leg" when here in Brazil we have stuff like Pé-de-Moleque or Pé-de-Moça ("Boy's Foot" or "Girl's Foot", it's a variation of the same sweet), Olho de Sogra ("Mother In Law's Eye"), Papo de Anjo ("Angel's Neck"), Cabelo de anjo ("Angel's Hair") and Baba-de-Moça ("Lady's Drool" - I swear to gods, google it), most of them are sweets or desserts, and even as someone from here I think it's gross and morbid as hell, lol
Can  you tell me why the English call this a "pudding"? In America, pudding is basically a sweet confection made with starch, milk and flavoring. I've never understood why there is such a difference in the term.
English Heritage: is it actually bad tasting?
Gross 😫
...that really does look like a dead man’s leg when it comes out of the wrapping.
There are 4 dumb people in the world!!
That’s the dead mans look!
Madam I appreciate your efforts & understand it's Victorian style. I wish to try this diah here in India. But in Hinduism we don't eat Beef. Can you please suggest a good replacement for beef suet for this or other recipes of yours ? Thank you.
Who and where is Mary anne?
What is suet?
What is suet?
What is suet?
What accent does she have? She pronounces "flour" and "water" with a rhotacized ("American-sounding") r, rather than than a schwa
Dead man’s leg..
I wonder why not just bake it?  It seems like it would be wonderful baked out of the oven....hmmm!
This women seriously needs her own show.
Not again. No cucumber.
She looks like a hundred years old....
beef suet is hard to come by here in central Texas, & there's really no good sub for it. I'd like to try to make this if I can come across some.
Haven't made this in 10years, never fry in lard, always fry in pork dripping, way better and a little garlic. Too good, always boiled the night before and fried with eggs for breakfast. Yes!!!!!!.😈😈😇
Did the cook / maids ever get to eat the  food the house ate?x
Awesome! New video!
Im sorry, but can anyone tell me why does she look at the camera that way when she  says dead man leg? does anyone know what dead man leg means?
You can tell the actress is not a good cook. The editors are really good
What is Suet?
It's basically 60% fat
That looks like bread, that ain’t pudding
Can someone please tell me what suet is?
First time on this channel. Did not know if this was a legit cooking show, or one of those joke shows. Was half expecting her to drop a punch line, like throwing the dough onto the floor and be like "It does't matter, because this is for the servants."

Off to watch more recipes.
My mam used to get angry at having to pay for school dinners when she made me a pack lunch, but the days i'd have dinner were Jam Roly Poly days, sorry Katherine,  I couldn't resist
i thought the english pronounce flour as 'flaah'
Let's see . . . . . there's already plenty of fatty bacon in that pudding, but then you fry it with lard.   Starchy fried foods such as fried bread and stir-fried rice can easily absorb a lot of oil.  If one is not careful, one will get a stomach ache of indigestion and will want to go to sleep.
Looks dense and under-flavoured, but Mrs. Crocombe was good.   Tell us more about that poor Mary Ann whom you run ragged.
I'd eat her moist pie. 👌😎👌
It doesn't even matter that that looks completely disgusting to me. I still watched it and loved it and can't wait for more of Mrs. Crocombe! :)
And I quote: “it doesn’t matter how it looks; as it is for the servants, but I have plenty of filling” wtf? That wasn’t necessary. @ 3:15
Why so many dessert recipes? Did Victorians enjoys desserts more than the main course?
I cringed when she says "MARY ANNE" at 2:20, expecting her to smack her assistant. That kitchen is steeped in abuse.
She's playing loose and fast with the word "pudding" here.
You Brits, making any old thing and calling it "pudding"! brb gonna make some beans and rice pudding in a tortilla. I'll even put some pudding salsa on it. Then I'll have some banana pudding. I mean it'll just be a banana, but why not make it sound fancy.
If I was transported back in time, I would deep fry everything. Most of the food in the UK looked so gross and bland. The Brits are so lucky to have colonised India and imported exotic ingredients.
the fug is beef suet?
I love this series, but I am beginning to see why British cooking has such a bad reputation.  Boiled pastry, no herbs or spices,  boiled bacon...
Thank you to all of our viewers who have such kind words to say about Mrs Crocombe.

If you'd like to try this recipe at home it’s very important to be careful when blowing the eggs. In some countries chickens are not vaccinated against salmonella so we suggest giving the eggs a good wash in boiling water and take care not to get any raw egg in your mouth.
"If you worked in a more modest household"
Mrs. C. Talking smack.
I love how she talks to the viewers as if everyone was from the Victorian era
Mrs Crocombe, please teach us to make gelatin out of calves feet
"If you live in a modern house, just put them in a refrigerator." Do the Victorians have fridges or did Mrs Crocombe just went meta on us?
HOMYGOD YESSSSS IT'S MY GIRL CROCOMBE
Vanillar... My grandparents  used to put an extra r on the end of some words too. Or in the middle like "warsh" instead of wash.
Something about this whole series makes me so happy. I love it so much. It's very interesting to see where our modern recipes have come from.
Am I the only one who hits ‘like’ even before I watch the video? All I know is- I read Mrs. Crocombe, English Heritage, I hit ‘like’.
It's good that you don't need to get the gelatine out of calves feet. ☺❤
I love vaniller.
Almost 7 minutes of Mrs Crocombe?! You're spoiling us! <3
What a breathtaking dessert and so carefully crafter (thanks for the tip regarding the eggs) Mrs. Crocombe has done it, again. We love her!
3:53 Sylvia seems holding her laughter so hard when being told to use those eggs to cook omelette lol
It's always a good day when we get to spend some more time in the kitchen!
The only disappointment is, it's over to quickly. I would love to see her do the cake and such. I also like the interaction with the other  kitchen staff. This is just way to good, love the history and cooking techniques . I have has some experience with creating medieval feast and it is a total blast, so much fun. Thank you English Heritage😍😍
I just looooooooooooooooooooooooove how she speaks!!!!!!!!!!! makes me feel peace!...
THIS ICONIC LADY DESERVES HER OWN COOK BOOK!!!!!
We always hear about the ice house, but I'm not entirely sure what it is.... so I googled it and and found out that Mrs Crocombe's ice was probably Norwegian as ice was often imported into the UK from Scandinavia up until the 1950s.
So this is what Mel C's been up to.
If you worked in a more modest household" low key savage Mrs. C
this has to be an extremely sophisticated dish at its time 😍
I love how you resealed the eggs wish I had thought of that later year when I used a similar process to make hallow chocolate eggs. You are truly a marvel
Mrs Crocombe thank you for this delicious recipe. I'll be sure to make it at my house. English Heritage, thank you for this nice and wonderful woman. 😊
What beautiful and delicate marbled eggs! The piped royal icing is so intricate. Perfect timing for Easter. Thank you very much for showcasing another lovely recipe by Mrs. Crocombe. She is a gem. 😊❤️
I love this series. In the future, will there be a presentation on the inner workings of the kitchen, such as how the oven and range work? Also, it would be fascinating to see how gargantuan tasks such as laundry and the washing up of dishes, things we take for granted today, were handled by the household staff.
I can imagine that mrs crocombe is smiling apon the people who are behind and make these videos. As well as her fans. I'm glad you are here to remember a very important woman!
These are absolutely gorgeous! I'd never thought of doing Easter eggs like this
🐣.  HAPPY EGG DAYS  .......... Thank you Mrs . Crocombe  . You are a ✨⭐️✨STAR  .
There we are.. marbled eggs.

She looked so proud while saying this at 6:02 <3
So pleasing to watch. The perfect video to unwind after a stressful day.
These videos are amazing, and what an engaging way to learn about English traditional cooking. Excellent photography and the Mrs. Crocombe character is the icing of the cake. Please we would love to see MORE !!!
Imported ice? I need to know  more!
It's lovely how they're hinting on the braybrookes' London townhouse.
This series is utterly delightful. I can't get enough of Mrs. Crocombe!
i' am really curious about hygiene the victorian way
THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME CHANNEL ! WOW , JUST WOW. BRILLIANT. I LITERALLY FEEL THEY TOOK YOUTUBE BACK IN TIME
Yum but wouldn't you have to clean the eggs first?
"You can take this... And make an omelete" what an honor 🎖
I absolutely adore Mrs. Crocombe😍. I wish I could visit this location and dine on many of these delicious recipes!!!!
I love this series! I click on these videos so fast! Can’t wait for the next one
We Adore her....Happy Easter.🐰🐣
Thank so much.
Something about a distinguished Englishwoman blowing the egg like that left me paralyzed with laughter for a good minute.

This is my favorite recipe so far by a long shot. Loved it
Idk but I'm so excited to see these notifications of the videos.  I'm smiling through the entire episode.  Can't wait for the other one.
I find it almost impossible to imagine the wonderful "Mrs Crocombe" in the modern world. These videos are amazingly immersive ❤!
"If you worked in a more modest household, you could of course use cocoa." = Victorian Throwing Shade
I just imagined Jane Austen talking to me throughout the recipe.
Your videos are so calming I love it
I had to stop the video just to say how much I love and appreciate these videos. Thank you so much for this!
You mentioned making gelatin from calves feet - showing a video on that would be cool
Amazing Mrs. Crocombe! What a recipe!
i feel i am an old lady from some years ago, searching on internet how to make marbled eggs for easter, like internet existed since then
This is such a good video~ I really love Mrs Crocombe, I have rewatched this for more than 5 times, i hope you will upload more and more in the future~ this series is too good♥😆😤
I always look forward to these! They are so insightful as well as entertaining.
If I may make a suggestion: A lot of the the recipes that Mrs. Crocombe is making are for sweets and desserts. I would love to see more savoury dishes featured in your videos. Otherwise, I love your channel. Please keep up the excellent work.
Mrs Crocombe makes me so happy! I love this videos so much ❤❤❤
i'm supposed to be studying but i cannot resist Mrs. Crocombe
I love this videos so much.
She deserves her own series
I love this series..She is teaching me a lot about cooking different foods.I am thinking of making some of her recipes. They look so good.
This is so adorable!!!!! Thanks for putting all the effort into these videos. They're very enjoyable to watch.
We stan Sista Sylvia for helping our Qwueen Mrs Crocombe
Mrs. C - basically told the maid to make herself useful by making an omelet, lol
I tried this yesterday and my kids just loved it! Thank you so much !
I find it fascinating that the chairman of the board for English Heritage is Sir Timothy Laurence,  husband of Anne, The Princess Royal. Love these videos!
This truly does feel like an anachronistic YouTube channel of a Victorian era cook.

Love it
This is just brilliant! We love you Mrs. Crocombe! 💕💕
That cheeky wink, Mrs Crocombe, i'm blushing!
Absolutely love this series! Mrs Crocombe is my fav ❤️❤️❤️
AW I've been waiting for this 💖 Lovely video
Idk how ive found these videos but this woman is absolutely delightful. The character is so well done and makes all the cooking seem so easy😂💜
production quality and content excellent as always!
Here I am crying because these videos are so beautiful ☹️😭♥️
can we get some victorian music in the background?
Thank you for this beautiful and interesting series.
"I used to make it myself out of calves feet."

I WERE SHOOK but then YEAH, GELATIN WERE MOSTLY MADE OF IT BEFORE
Lemme get Silvias number tho. Or however they contacted each other. The victorian way
I love the sound every time something is poured its so refreshing to hear
Watching this, feels like being back in time. I always start to imagine how it used to be😊 and how they are going to eat the food!
I love mrs crocombe . Pls upload more of her recipes and cooking videos they are just the best . Looking forward for more fun videos of her cooking .
These videos are so heartwarming! I love them :)
Honestly I just come for the bit where the ingredients are being measured in slow-mo. It's so relaxing!
Im so glad to see another video with the lovely Mrs. Crocombe that I automatically liked it before watching! 😊
Wow that is a lot of work and it came
Out perfect!! Mine would be gross looking I am sure
i love this woman!
I reaaaaally love how Mrs  Crocombe always looks so happy and proud with her cookings every time she finishes preparing one.. She's like a gleaming sunshine :"3
"...Or, you could put them in the refrigerator..." Whooa calm down there George Jetson
I think if you tip them from side to side, or use the sharp tool to do a half-hearted stir, you'd get a more honest marbling effect
Always a pleasure to watch her. Much blessings and hope you keep posting more of Mrs. Crocombe
I love this serie so much!!!! I'm literally obssesd with Victorian Era, and those videos are really intresting! ❤
What conversion factor would be used between leaves of gelatine and packets of Knox gelatin?
Vaniller Lol 😂 Love her ♥️♥️♥️
I will have to try this with my family this Easter 🙂🐣🥚🌹
I accidentally fast forwarded to 3:34 and was a bit ... shocked. Didn’t see the egg and thought she was doing something awful with her nose! 

Why would you do that to desert!?!?, I thought.
I am American but dang i got sucked into the Vortex of English heritage youtube videos. And now i am bing watching lol
Everything looks so aesthetically pleasing ugh-

UGH-

I LOVE IT-
I really enjoy this channel so much 😍🙋💕💕
I love this series so much! Thank you for making such top quality videos.
Miss Crocombe is my favorite YouTube person :)
I was actually blowing out eggs earlier, to decorate them for Easter with my nephew later...and it was really hard to get the stuff out. Now I know why...I didn’t poke through the insides! 
Also: this recipe is genius. We already decide to make the apple hedgehog from an earlier video and I think we‘ll make this as well 🤗
I'm curious about the raw egg that would still be lined in the shells
What’s the American equivalent of 7 leaves of gelatin? We use packets
Nobody realized that when I am stressed over upset i watch her until i feel calm again.
3:26, did miss Crocombe winked at me😮😮😂😂
Someone at Audley End House must've taken pity on me because I was really wanting a video. I am such a history buff and you guys at English Herritage really know how to appease that for me. Thank you for the videos.
I Love this Lady.  I Love watching and Listening... and so much information.. and Fabulous Presentation.
I love this videos so much! thank you for making them!
"Arlmonds"

"Vanillar"

God, I love this woman...
Ms Crocombe! Blink three times fast if you need to be rescued!
My, Sylvia is the epitome of unparalleled European beauty)
Is this lady irish?   Seems she trying to shed the accent but some words has the Irish draw.   Also I love how they put the list of ingredients in slow motion to make it epic and dramatic!    I'm not trying to be negative it's never my intention,  I do enjoy watching these, they are fascinating to watch how the Victorian era done it.   Well for the wealthy that is.  I'm also interested on how how the very poor cooked what they had only and to put together anything they could to make do.  Plz try doing an episode or two sometime.  Thank you very much for doing these btw!  Love it!  ❤❤❤👍
The way all the ingredients were filmed was amazing.  Really top shelf.
will we ever get to see a tour of Audley End house?
Mrs. Crocombe is very proud of her work!! Love, love, LOVE her :D
What do we want to see next? I’m thinking a hand raised pie or some fancy biscuits.
Love the qualitt of yhe footage and the closeups❤
Did anyone else notice that the kitchen maid's name goes from Mary Ann to Sylvia between episodes or am I just imagining it? Either way, lovely episode as always :)
Please make the video: How to dress properly - The Victorian Way
Imported ice?  Wow.  I never thought about that, I guess it doesn’t freeze much in England
Such a terrific actress!!
Ahhh...such a cure for my depression watching ur cooking episodes English heritage..thanks Mrs crocombe
She's back!!! :D Really love this series, you guys are doing an amazing job, keep it up!
"if you worked in a more modest household, you could use cocoa"

flex
I was having such an awful day. I come home, sore, from toiling in my shop all day, and my day turned right around when I found another lovely vid from the brilliant Mrs. Crocombe! Thank you for showing us such a lovely recipe!
That cake with the marbled eggs inside would be beautiful with fresh or candied violets scattered over. :) Or lilac blossoms, or some other edible purple flower.
I adore these treasures. Thank you so much.
yay! love Mrs. Crocombe
Seeing her blow the yolk out was so nostalgic. I did it all the time in Montessori school  and unfortunately haven't seen anyone do it since.
She’s does a great job. These videos are so enjoyable. This would make for a great show on the food network
When you dislike eggs and have nothing to do with this video, but you still watch it for this delicate English heritage and beautiful made-up accent of Mrs. Crocombe, because you don't want to miss any. 💞
I am so glad that I found your channel.  It's lovely.
Love her! from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
I dont know what it is but Mrs. Crocombe's voice is so calming
This lady is genius. How fascinating
Please do a video for 19th century Turkish delight, it'd be a good way to incorporate rose water recipes.
Thank you so much for posting these ....love them...please keep them coming  !
I subscribed, this channel series is soo amazing! Can't wait for new videos of her!
I love Ms Crocombe! This whole videp series is really magical and engaging. Can't wait to visit someday.
Seeing this reminded me of our visit to Audley End where they have a fabulous kitchen.
Thank you
To any modern day viewers,

Try to use free range, organic eggs for this, as these eggs are much less likely to be contaminated with salmonella. (Historically Accurate!) Also, rinse the outside shell before cracking for extra security.
Amazing love your channel a window into the past
I find watching this lady comforting.
I'am Brazil amo seus videos
"Thank you Sylvia"

Wasn't her name Mary Ann? She was from the Christmas cake video.
“If you live in a more...modest...house” That my friends is called Victorian Era 🔥 Fire 🔥
I would love to just live in that house and learn from this lady. Looks like a lot of work but I appreciate this so much. Thank you people for being so amazing.
One day you're going to become a meme 👏👏
Im gonna try this recipe, im gonna start now. hope i do well
HuNnY bLoWwW





YaSsSsSsS
That's how I like my salmonella, on sweets.
This has quickly turned into one of my favorite series on YouTube
I think this actress can do a splendid portrayal of Queen Victoria. Love you Kathy ❤️
Hooray for Mrs Crocomber . She did made candy for Easter.  Good show!
"Poke it in" * winks *
Me: * leans back from the screen *
Will Lord and Lady Braybrook ever make an appearance??
Totally love these videos!
She is to make gelatin out of calves feet!!!wow
I love the Mrs Crocombe series. It is so peaceful and relaxing and I feel like i'm in Victorian England for a few minutes.
I suspect she has a magnificent bosom.
Wow! What a great recipe, beats my store  bought Cadbury eggs  any day! 🤣😂🤣😂 Mrs. Crocombe I ❤U...🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
I so enjoy all of your videos. Thanks for sharing.
These videos make me proud to be a brit ❤
EH, I can't thank you enough - these videos are awesome! I am young, but have always been fascinated by the Victorian period and culture of life. I just last year bought my first house which (for US standards) is somewhat old - it was build in 1903. It still has many of the characteristics of it's birth - I still have the cistern in the attic for gravity fed water. I am so glad to have found your channel and plan to follow many of your examples for holidays and good meals! Thanks again!
This is absolutely amazing and I've never seen anything like it. Marbled eggs? Sounds divine and I bet they taste amazing.
Fascinating recipe. Great presentation. I would never make it but I could dream. Happy Easter!
Yay!! Thank you for coming back~~
I always adore these vidoes!
average people:vanilla 
me:vanillar
How thoughtfully delightful!
Thank you!
I love your video and I want to have your life 😭😭😂😂❤️❤️❤️
A sweet main course? Never heard of that, but who says no to dessert
Vaniller lol!! I just love her!!! We need a whole show dedicated to her!!!
My goodness so much work for a sweet!
Mrs. Crocombe is the best!
Scottish lassie cooking for the English ? I keep hearing scottish in some words.... Lovely work!
I like how unique these videos are and the fact that it's nicely edited adds to the fact that it's a great video. Good and easy to read tutorial and some darn good commentary!
imported ice????
Very Impressive -  TwoThumbs Up For This Channel 😀
I jump into youtube whenever I see one video of Mrs Crocombe 💚
This is great education, not only for my kids but for myself. Just recently found a good bit of English heritage and this is such a wonderful gateway to that time. Plus, I'd like to challenge myself to try this. 😊
Now you just contact salmonella from the eggs not being washed out. Oh well it will be a great Easter with stomach pain and diarrhea....
I thought her name was Maryanne?!
I want Mrs. Crocombe to be my cooking teacher
I really want to make this <3
I wish these videos could last 30 minutes.
I literally want her to be my mom
The Eggs are Beautiful!! Great job !! Happy Easter 🐣🐰
I need to do this! I'm getting hungrier whilst watching these.
I watch this channel only because of Mrs Crocombe.
They’re beautiful. Thank you, Mrs. Crocombe. 😀
ودي اذوقها
Thank you for another great video!
Excellent video again!  She does her part beautifully.  I can't wait to try making these.  Does anyone know how much gelatin is in a leaf?  I can't get leaves.
She's  so Hypnotic  i can't  stop watching.... I'm  in Love😍
something about these are calming
like a simpler time sounds nice haha
I love this channel! ❤️ Victorian period is my favorite 😀
Ok. At the end of this video while she was displaying them I got a slight whiff of chocolate. HELP
I agree with making yourself feel confident with cleaning the eggs before you blow them by what ever means you think would work. Though not everyone will agree, I think a good steaming or boiling after the egg is blown would make me feel very good about sterilization. An added benefit is that you have no runny egg white on your chocolate after you remove the shell from the chocolate. I thought about running the chocolate eggs under water after they come out to remove any egg white. I just did n't feel like I liked that idea.
These videos are sooooo relaxing <3
She's so lovely. She reminds me of the woman who makes the best cresent rolls.  ❤
Lovely! Thank you. 🤗❤️
Mrs. Crocombe will be trending one day, mark my words
they look so yummy i want one hehe
All I can think about it's salmonella 👀
I just love this channel! I could watch it all day long.
Who dislikes these videos?! SHOW YOURSELVES
She's back! I love Mrs. Crocombe! I will be trying this recipe soon. My only question is, here in Arizona, USA we only have powdered gelatin. How would I use that in this recipe?
I can’t get Enough of Mrs Crocombe the videos need to be longer 😁🥰😁🥰😁🥰
Aaaaand you have a new subscriber.

(I love her extra R's btw! That's a West Country thing, isn't it? I used to live in Bristol and I heard that a lot. People go shopping to ASDAR over there. It was so nice to hear that kind of accent again. I don't particularly miss living in England, but I'd love to go back to Bristol for a visit! What a great city.)
Imported ice from North America!; will surely use that in a joke soon.Mrs Crocombe is very witty.
How did they manage to import ice (especially from far away places like America) without it melting before the advent of refrigeration?
Please meme this scene 3:33
Well presented and I love it, but..

..couldn't you just whisk the egg?!

EDIT: Oh. I hadn't finished yet...
That was wonderful!  I'm going to try that!
There's something about these videos that is so calming and peaceful. I love the recipes and of course the charming and charismatic Mrs Crocombe! Thank you for creating a thing that makes me happy in this world.
I really enjoy watching these videos 😀😀😀
I love this channel so much
I really love mrs crocombe♥ , I wish I was her kitchen maid
Such an amazing woman! Thank you for the show
When I saw the notification on my phone, I got so excited! Looked forward to this the whole day. As always, a wonderful video of Mrs Crocombe.
Didn't know Sporty spice from the spice girls had a cooking show...
This is something we never knew we needed
I only came upon this channel yesterday. Delightful videos.
Donyou actually work in that outfit outside filming?
Beautiful❤️
I'm going to try to make this for Easter, but I'm a vegetarian so I'm going to use agar agar instead of calf's foot gelatin.
How did they keep ice from melting back in those days?
That looks delicious! 😋
I don’t know why but I love watching this
I would love to see the bloopers from this channel’s videos lmao
She is the 4th wall breaker of the era
Love these videos. Definitely need to try this
Everytime I watch this, I'm just laughing at how much Mrs. C is throwing shade left and right.
If Martha Stewart had been born in the United Kingdom.....
Omg someone named Sylvia!!! 😱
You're back! YAY!!!
Looks fantastic !!
The Victorian eggs and spit omelet for the servants  XD
What a brilliant recipe and technique! Thank you!
Vaniller- Madea?
What a lovely recipe.
Does anyone else ever wonder how people came up with things??? Like who was the person who came up with gelatin from calves feet???
Это чудо! Thank you very much!
I will try this next Easter!
NEW PERSON SILVIA!! ❤❤❤ she looks cute 😀
I wanna sleep in that house with my BFFs💖💖💖💖
Hm... I say "vanilla" instead of "vanillar"... and "gelatin" instead of "gelatine"
How Fascinating. As Are All Her Videos
YAAAAAAAAAAAS MRS CROCOMBE IS BACK YALL!!!!!!!!!!!!
huh, so apparently food refrigerators were first put into use in the late 1850's, so technically could have had a Victorian household with a refrigerator (though I doubt it was ever common, seems it your were more likely to find them at a larger scale butchers operation to keep the meat cold and fresh)
Outstanding! 😀😀😀
Sylvia is number 1 CUTE GIRL
You Are My Favorite Person 💖
How this hasn’t been expanded and adapted to be a TV show is beyond me. Who wants Delia or Nigella when you can have Mrs Crocombe. The historical aspect alone is fascinating.
Oh wow everything came out so nice.
Woah, woah, why hello there Sylvia.😂
I have to rinse the eggs right?
After tipping out the white and yolk ...before filling in the cream?
You go Mrs. Crocombe <3
Waggle it around when your done blowing that yoke 😸
A refrigerator?! Pish Posh I say! The refrigerator is a fad!
MRS. CROCOMBE!!!
I can't find the comment that asked about the imported ice, but if anyone wants to know more about how ice first started being imported I totally recommend the episode "The Ice King" of the 99% Percent Invisible podcast where they explain how this business started.
YASS IT'S YA GURL MRS CROCOMBE!
She has such lovely fingers 😊 these videos are my favorite things on the internet 😍
I swear to God I love those vintage kitchens
This is the best video ever
Love these videos!! You guys should also have the lady of the house at the end of the videos trying and tasting and describing the flavor and how good it is !!!
There’s something so soothing and sweet about Mrs. Crocombe’s voice. I love these videos!
Isnt that a lowkey recipe for salmonella?
I love this. So creative and inventive to showcase things of the past. I also love how the lady throws shade at us.
Mrs.Crocombe is a marbleous confectioner she is just to modest to say so 😉😉
Your videos are so different and unique! Its more like story telling. ❤️
Did Mrs. Crocombe say she had to make gelatin from cow’s feet ?    What exactly is gelatin?
My new favorite YouTube channel 😍😍😍
I love Mrs Crocombe so much. I find each episode of this series very enchanting thanks to her presence.
Oh but that omelet by Sylvia though... thanks for the tip about blowing the eggshells. bleh
Mrs Crocombe, I can feel that something is different in this video (and im not talking about your breaking the 4th wall)... Is this a sign that we'll get to meet the Lord and Lady of Audley End?
i love the aesthetic
These videos are all so wholesome, i binge the entire playlist like once a month.
Or if you live in a modern house use a... Refrigerator
I would love to live there!😍
Every time another character makes an appearance in a Mrs. Crocombe video, I always hope they'll get their own segments, too. #TheSylviaShow
She should have been cast at Downton Abbey as a guest star.
I LOVE these videos!!
I love this series! The actress who plays Mrs. Crocombe is so good and soothing. It's also very interesting to see how recipes have evolved.
Eggs looks good....but I'm just a Yank.
Best wishes from San Francisco... this show of yours is charming.
Do English people put an "r" at the end of some words or is it just my hearing?
The way everything is well done and Mrs. Crocombe herself saying marbled eggs proudly makes me want to keep watching on how this series would turn out!
I'd put a piece of duct tape on the bottom. I wish you cut one or tried one. Hope it taste good.🍚
i love her so much she is my life
The wonderful Mrs. Crocombe !
Refrigerators existed during the Victorian times?
Is this like..real? Is this lady actually like this and stuff?.. lol I randomly stumbled upon this video.
I’m sorry to be so forward, but I adore you, Mrs. Crocombe...
Thank goodness we have molds now. I don't have the patience to handle eggs like that
Does she know about modern refrigerators because she's met the doctor?
She sounds like Mrs beaver from the BBC version of the lion the witch and the wardrobe! Nostalgic af
Absolutely delightful!
Where have these been all my life
This series is so quaint, so sweet, so calming, and so educational! You have a new subscriber here for sure!
AWESOME 👍🍀 THANKS
This woman looks like my geography teacher
vanillerrr
Making gelatin myself out of cow's feet. The epitome of refinement
Oh the good ol' days.
3:38 Severe sinus congestion!
I LIVE for these videos
i love the asmr vibes of this video
I love this channel and show. It’s so soothing and I love seeing how things are made. So much better than all things from a box like today.
I wish you were my wife.
Wait a minute.. did Shane learn the egg thing from this? 🤣
Amazing recipe!
cocoa is for the poor. it's official.
I miss going to the UK.
The actress is brilliant
Is Mrs Crocombe from Broadchurch?
The minute she started blowing through the real eggs, I decided that the egg-shaped mold you use for Jello Jigglers works just as well. LOL
YAYY! <3 ANOTHER VIDEO!
she could blow the yolk out of my eggs any time.
More please! I love Mrs. Crocombe. When I am having a stressful day, I love to watch these videos and they instantly relax me, and it's so interesting to see how our ancestors prepared dishes that in today's world, can easily come pre-made in a box and take 10 minutes to prepare, but they didn't have that option back then.
Кому интересен такой формат? ((
I just simply love everything Mrs. Crocombe does!
Wow. Sylvia is beautiful
1000th!
Absolutely amazing 😊.
I love vaniller
So beautiful.
'Im very lucky to have grocer near me', you don't mean a convenience store?
I remember doing this as a kid lol
"The ice trade was a 19th-century industry, centering on the east coast of the United States and Norway, involving the large-scale harvesting, transport and sale of natural ice for domestic consumption and commercial purposes. Ice was cut from the surface of ponds and streams, then stored in ice houses, before being sent on by ship, barge or railroad to its final destination around the world."
this is amazing! I was super waiting for this!
Oh I love these videos so much. I wish we knew more about Mrs. Crocombe
I wish we got to see the texture of these things. I know it isn't period-appropriate for her to eat them herself, but I'm sure there's a way she could show us what texture they ought to have if we do it correctly. That would be awesome.
How to get salmonella on Easter 🐣
Very good!!! A very brilliant idea for Easter 👌👌👌 Marbeled eggs a cute Easter snack 👍👍👍 ... This is a very lovely video 💯💯💯 ... Thank-you so much for showing us this witty way and remembering us of different ways of celebrating Easter Day 😘😘😘😘😘... From Egypt lots of love and hugs ,, and Happy Easter 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Cake as an entree? Now I've seen everything.
When I saw marbled eggs I thought it was something completely different.
Poke it in, Waggle it around. ;)
Wtf who buys imported ice???? 😂😂😂😂😂
Beautiful😍🍫😋😋👏👏👏
The accent sounds Irish.
Cant wait to try this recipe ♥
i dont know how I got here but I'm here and I love it
I've always wanted to see Lady Braybrooke :(
What a interesting receipt
I LOVE MRS. CROCOMBE AND HER COOKING LESSONS SOOO MUCH!!!😭😭😭💕
I'm a new subsciber. Just love your videos and the kitchen. It reminds me of my late great grandmother.
How did the poor manage to eat all their meals?! This is time consuming! And the clean up!
4:04 Fun Fact: A long time ago (maybe around the 18th or 19th century) most of the world's best imported ice came from New England.
She's back!!!!
It's so educative and exciting to watch these traditional videos and what life used to be in the Victorian era.
I'm obsessed with this channel and I'm not even english!
I adore her accent 💕
I can't eat  many things with gelatin in them because I'm a wimp and the calves feet thing grosses me out but this really looks interesting
Another riveting installment!  Thank you for the video!
Love your video from Hong Kong
Vanillar😂
What a lovely lovely channel and a lovely cook Mrs. Crocombe so talented and I love the way she talks and explaining things, motherly like. Just found out about this channel accidentally and now I'm binge watching Mrs. Crocombe's cooking vids. Thank you ever so much.
I'm obsessed with watching Mrs. Crocombe's videos. A true queen in the kitchen!
that must take a whole day to make!
Very interesting! One question--is that your real accent?
Sylvia is a beautiful girl.
Are the recipes copyrighted? are we allowed to copy them?
I love this lady
3:49 savage
Thumbs up if y'all ain't here for the cookin
I love this show. You must be really a patient person to do something like this.
So ice is a thing of luxury back in the olden days? They do say you learn something new everyday.
Now imagine a cooking show like this but with mrs Patmore. Downton Abbey, anyone? 😄
What is royal icing? A buttercream?
Wow. Just wow.
Oh my, the kitchen staff has expanded :D
I thought it was tea eggs lol
I can probably eat a dozen.   They look yummy.
Why don't you read the ingredients out loud?
Oh, what fun! Thank you so much for sharing such a delicious treat!
Mrs. Crocombe is a queen!  I love every single video which features her!
Sugar dissolves!!  Dissolved not melted!!  And blow the egg?!!!  Good God woman!
currently on an English heritage marathon
I'm thankful my job isnt so tedious.
Her smile is so warming
These videos and me feel comfortable...i don't know how to explain it really!! I adore them
I love your videos!!! So sweet
But her dishcloth comes from IKEA though... I have the same one 😁
LOL 3:30 is hilarious
Damn I love this series 👍🏻
People has ice back then? Like outside of Winter?
It looks like the actress legit enjoys cooking these.
Question?  Can you somehow swirl the eggs to get a swirled design?
what is lord and lady braybrooke means?
I love the sound of her voice
But what does all this effort come to: Augusta saying, "Thank you. They're quite lovely." lukewarmly. And then Lady what's her face saying, "You can leave now".
Skill Level: Impossible
Imported ice from North America? Was that a thing? 😂
Weird but interesting.
I loove this 😁🌹
This is so interesting to watch 🖤
I want to see a show with her and all the other housekeepers!!
Emmymadeinjapan needs to make this
what if I dont have leafs of gelatine but packs of gelatine
I like her lol
I always feel like she's gonna come to my room and beat my ass for breathing every time I watch these videos. she has some big d energy it's scary lmaoooo
This lady is brave,wow.
Calves feet. .. Well no more jello for me. Finish what's already in the house abs not buying it again.
Is she going to cook rabbit for Easter? ;)
Refrigerator😂😂
one of my fav series uwuwuwuwuuw
She's a good actor!! Keep it up!
Who in their right mind would EVER give a thumbs down to these videos?
I watch the mrs crocombre show every morning, when i have breakfast. Love you mrs crocombre.
I wish you would have cut one open.
These videos are so charming!
Another lovely video featuring Mrs. Crocombe! I do believe this is the very first video where I've seen her hair askew just a wee bit at the end. How very human of her. :)
"Here you go Sylvia take these spit flavoured raw eggs...and make an omelette"......mmm yummy!
Practice (3:31) makes perfect.
I'm obsessed with these videos, this woman is a gem
My mom would blow eggs like that when I was little. Totally forgot about that. Takes me back.
3:31 - 3:43 someone should make that into a meme
Amazing recipe, so creative too.
Flavored with chocolate and vaniller
Please, please, more Mrs. Crocombe!
Thank god for silicone molds
wonderful series!
I would love to see the bloopers of these videos 😂😂😂
i love your show please dont stop!
Tha gelatine is SO not victorian
Am I the Only who remember Nanny Mcphee while Watching this? 😅 i don't know why 😂
I can't even cook and hate cooking but I love watching this channel
Is it possible to make it without the gelatin
it's just so fascinating to watch this
yaaaas mrs crocombe you betta work
I love these videos! They give insight into Victorian cooking!
She sounds so Irish, it's adorable!!!
Oh so wonderful, some day I'm going to come and visit. Just lovely
Ice from North America? Hahahahah
I love how she says Vanilla
One of my new favorite places to be is in this gal's kitchen!
You should let Sylvia host a lesson sometime! Demonstrate what she's learned :)
Such a lovely video... I notice that you paid attention to ingrédients packaging and it's interesting to see how packaging has changed ! I didn't knew that gelatine leaf exists at that time !
This might sound dumb but they had geletin sheets, vanilla extract , ice  in Victorian age ?
Just found this and subscribed and loving it..
ermergerd, i lurrrve me some vanillurrr!
Imported ice, from North America?
Salmonella
Vaniller
moreeee please moreeeeee i love you ms crcombe you make days sunny
Loving the series from the beginning
Mrs. Crocombe, I really wanted to know how the eggs tasted and what they looked like in the middle. Maybe in the future you share a sample it for us and let us know see how it looks and  tastes in the video? Thanks for sharing, your amazing!:) -United States
I want one! :0
That looks delicious.
Um she blew the 
egg with her mouth unsanitary
Now here's a good friday activity =) how lovely are these? Would take a lot of patience and delicate hands lol
대단하다....
If I could give many more likes I would i just love Mrs. Crocombe recipes.
I live for these omg, I hope they never end
Yuck! I am so glad things aren't done this way anymore!
I saw that wink.
Sylvia looks like the female version of Malfoy
I wonder if that lady person exists and they actually all live there with ‘servants’
3:33 Mrs Crocombe clearing her nose into a bowl lol
Kinder egg's original recipe😏
I can’t stop watching and admiring this! It is the reminder of an era gone by. Mrs. Avis Crocombe is such a beautiful lady.
I love this series. Have you ever watched Townsend's videos? He specializes in Colonial American cookery and culture; I think you and he would get on wonderfully.
Really love this show history is returning
I can only understand a little English, but I love this woman's voice.
I love the victorian way!
this series always remind me of emma a victorian romance manga
Omg girl run some water into the holes on the inside, salmonella. You're trying to kill us I think lol
Am i the only one who binge watches Mrs Crocombe's  videos??
需要中英對照字幕
hi is any more of aviz crocmbe coming soon
Clearly Silvia is the favorite, her tone and everything she ever says to her is thank you.
❤ Love the recipie!!!
This is getting better every episode. Everyday that Mrs Crocombe makes a new recipe, it`s a day that I enjoy a little more.
Was anyone else curious about her comment saying they import ice from North America? What does that mean, why do they need it imported?
Is it custom for a maid to curtsy to a cook (as when Mrs. Crocombe got the chocolate)?
Ohhhh I like her!
Shes usually more Sassy, I love it when she's a sassy upper-class cook. We demand more Sass!
I love your accent!
It seems like English people pronounce ‘a’ at the end of a word as ‘er’.
so this is the history of cadbury creme eggs i assume!
If I had £1 for every time she’s said Lord and Lady Braybrooke on this channel, I’d be bloody richer than Lord and Lady Braybrooke!
Another great video, love it.  Thanks
Why is she so shady??😂😂😂😂
I'm so excited to try this recipe!
Just so beautiful!
😍
In the Victorian era you say "something gay" not "something fun" ;)
IS THIS ROLE PLAY
That sure looks decadent!
It's lovely see you cooking this dishes
Perfectly yummy!!!😊😊😊
Wow.....This was soooooooooo AMAZING.
What would we do without Sylvia!
It looks so good!
This is the era of everything going into a mold and yet there's not an egg shaped mold?
I doubt she had to make gelatin from cows feet when she was younger. She lies so much!!
I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!!!
Modest household lol
Will attempt this for easter
I really want to try to make them
I love love love English Heritage
I just love all these ms. Crocombe videos
Can you please more videos?
Auguster 😂
Could that good grocer’s name be Tesco?
Wow🙄
They picked the right lady to do all this.. I never get tired of watching her videos
Imported ice from North America? Why not Sweden or Norway?
Love how you say chocolate
Who names there daughter that!?
Thank you I had heard the term Marbled Eggs before but never knew what they were. So this was very interesting. And take your time when you give directions and show how to prepare the items. This looks like it would be doable for me. I may try this next Easter. Maybe I'll ask my daughter and my niece. They are both up for trying new things.  I think I'll suggest they watch the video before hand.  Thank you again Mrs. Crocombe job well done.
She is lovely as always
i cannot understand why they would go through the whole process of hollowing out eggshells rather than just making re-usable moulds
Mrs. Crocombe is so adorable and kind!
Shes gorgeous
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
My goodness 3:35 , I thought she was blowing her nose into the dish to get back at lord and lady braybrooke. : D
❤️
I want this so bad. Noms... This reminds me of Victorian Farm, one of my fav shows, her and my girl Ruth would get on well.
I was thinking about using, if i can find some, egg molds. That way i don't have to worry about using up real eggs.
💓💓
I LOVE YOUUUUUUU
These videos make me want to go back in time...but then I remember there was no a.c., antibacterial hand soap, and probably not everyone had a toilet and didn't shower everyday. But with this channel, you can have the best of both worlds!!
I’m addicted to these videos, it’s so relaxing and interesting!
mrs crocombe is a real skinny legend
Yasssssss
Was the imported ice thing a joke? It sounds very much like it, but it might as well be true, knowing how the upper classes still are to this day
eggs look rotten
their heads is shiny😆
finally💗😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I must say I am obsessed with these videos. It is so interesting to learn about English heritage even though I was born and live in America. I’ve always been interested in the history of the English and this is extremely fascinating.
What?? No wash egg shell?? What about salmonella??
I just looked at this with my mouth hanging open for 7 minutes straight...result... was a loud wth? Why....just why?....I give up.
I do believe that to be Ruth Goodman's Daughter playing Sylvia!
verniller
I wonder if agar works as gelatine replacement? Tbh agar is more common than gelatine in my country, its kinda hard to find gelatine sheets ard.
Another amazing video :) thank you!
i wish this was a tv series.
Sweet smile
What a nice recipe!
Oh god beef
This woman is like this in real life?
I love her expressions and voice so much
Hmm fancy stuff
Ice from North America!!!
I have never heard of egg blowing in my life.
❤️
a twist on townsend
Insane.
I am curious to try this recipe  but scared about poking a hole in the eggs to blow the stuff out. Nervous about the egg making a mess everywhere.
I love these videos
"a more modest household" 😭 she dissin us
How do you stop the shell from being in the custard?
Why is it called royal icing?
Easter is pagan
in a more modest house
No brandy this time?
How would they freeze ice back then/keep it cold long enough to use in the kitchen?
Amazing!
vanillarrr
Sylvia wore a costume made herself look decent just to hamd chocolate and make omelettes hahaha
Is this where the whole jello egg thing came from? I remember making jelly eggs for Easter all the time
such an adorable video
Oh my gosh !..... Hahahaha...LOL.   I have never seen that done ..... blow the yoke out of its shell.   Is this how the word bloke was invented ?
The Prequel to Kinder Eggs?!
And I thought Nigella was naughty: "But before I do that, I'm going to make one of my holes big enough to be able to  fit my little funnel. And I'm going to block the other one to stop the cream escaping out the bottom."
Vaniller
Was she in call the midwife
I may just have to give making these a shot for Easter. another lovely video
Ive C R A C K E D this one a little
Vanillr
Ooo they have a gelatin sheet
And how about the omelette 3:51? how about it?
Can I please work in your kitchen? I'm a baker 🥖🍩🍰
Mind absolutely blown by Victorian know-how.
Awesome she is back!!!!! My favorite!!
I own some very cute calves - and their mums and dad!  The thought of some poor wifey having to make gelatine the hard way makes me wince!  All my cattle have names and love being petted like big dogs!
She is back !
Would they look more marbled if you  moved them around a bit before they set to acheive a sort of swirl in the pattern?
vaniller
So comforting.  However, I would not want to eat an omelette made of eggs that have had someone's hot breath infused. This household consumes a LOT of sugar and brandy!
These videos are so aesthetically pleasing
3:25 ??
Fabulous
Even if you die You can't get the sophistication of victorian. You are just not the same.
Now that is a woman
who's suppose to eat that omelette
“Vanner”
I remember we did the egg blowing when I was in kindy and we made eggs like this - but not edible, just decorative
I would die if this series stop😂😂😂
Salmonela
I feel very close to her, like shes my aunt 😂
3:34
Ok, I know I’m asking a stupid question here, but educate me anyway!

Where did ice come from in those days? Where would water have been frozen? The video says it was sometimes imported from North America. Would it have been brought on ships?

I’ve always been befuddled by the creation of ice before it was so accessible to us in our freezers.
vaniler
they had gelatine at the victorian time ???
Just a quick message, in the USA chickens are not vaccinated for salmonella (despite British success).
that's a bosom
Her "Good Afternoon" reminds me so much of my 3rd grade English teacher :) School wasn't that bad when I was a kid, don't know about nowadays.
Oh how appetizing. I am sure that somewhere in the world some miscreant got off watching her blow that egg.
I love these videos
I guess these are all those kill and starve those peasants in India and then lets eat these comfort food at home kind of a recipe
what would these taste like?
Nice!
I am not meaning to shame Mrs. Crocombe because she is a queen. But at 3:35 are looks like she is having a thicc nose blow
I love it!
my aesthetic
Yes Michigan the ice from Michigan was lake ice and the clean nature ice one point in time the state was not just in ice in trade the othere was meat from hunting because they can send meat with ice I think that how that down hahahah.
When she pour the cream and use the spoon push up against the pot to help control the pouring, that's one technique that no one is going to tell you. You need to steal from the master chef. How detail and neat in this video!
Brava!
Wow!
Haha I remember blowing the whites and the yokes out of the eggs for easter, we'd then dye the eggs all sorts of pastel colors. Leaving a marble effect on the hollowed out shells, we'd then get a string and like a wreathe string the cluster up a bove our back door all year (color didn't fade nor did the eegs smell) until it was easter time again. It was a fun tradition!
nice...
Muito legal
How does ice make it from north america to there without melting back then?
I wonder how did they made ice caves at that time
Beautiful
Did England really import ices from America? Why can't they make it themselves?
She's essentially talking to her self
Why am I watching this?
If u dont wash truly the eggs shelves , dont they will stink and ruin the taste of the actual Easter cream eggs ?  🐣
This is really cool
this is soothing but it kind of also scares me? idk if anyone else thinks this has creepy undertones lol
I'm at creppy side of youtube again
Her voice is so soothing
Cadbury.
VANILIAIR
they certainly had their own little tricks to making shit look cool back then
Lol let's blow the egg out.
Is mrs crocombe a character in this show, ie a fictional Victorian woman speaking to us like a narrator, or is she a straight up Victorian rp
Thanks
Am I the only one who heard IMPORTED  ICE😂😂😂😂😂
From which part of England is her accent?
Very interesting.
I thought the maid was called Mary Ann, not Sylvia?  She comes in the Christmas cake video.
how did they made ice?
She won my heart at 3:38.  I've always wondered how to do that.
We like the music.
Lovely
I feel like the imported ice comment was from my "Wtf is an ice house?" comment on a previous video. Maybe not.... But I'll pretend like ot was ;)
Could someone please tell me a modern alternative to the gelatine sheets? I really want to make these, but I'm not sure how much gelatine is in the sheets compared to something I could buy at the store...
She throwing shade like it’s sunny
What's an ice cave?
Love it :) As a child we used to blow out eggs to make our own chocolate easter eggs, so much fun.
Nice
Is this real
nice, but do they really look marbled? looks like too much white and that the layers are too thick of each color.
Are you familiar with Townsends? They make 18th century repro clothing, and their food videos are amazing. I think you'd love it!
So lovely
As she was using that shard in the egg?  NOW THAT IS TALENT!  I would have made a troublesome mess! LOL!
Calves feet?
This came up recommended to me...on Halloween.
I love Mrs Crocombe and her style. However I can't help wonder what she would look like in everyday clothes with her eyebrows on fleek and some dramatic eye makeup.
I simply adore these videos but I’m sorry I refuse to eat something made in an egg shell mold whos yolk was blown out by someone’s own mouth
Nice
For the other half, of the cream on the stove can't you also used melted chocolate chips?
did anyone else think that when she blew into the eggs it looked like she was snotting into the bowl lmao
bjak.... disgusting!
If I tried making a hole in an egg I’d crack the whole thing 😂
So do u actually live in that house and work in that house exactly like a 1700's house maid?
Omg this is so stupid. LMFAO
HOMIE CROCOMBE!!!!
Can I just melt white and brown chocolate with the cream without gelatin and then let it solidify the same way in each egg?
When she started to blow the egg I was like wtf is she doing
In case of any salmonella wouldn't eventual remains of raw egg inside the egg possibly infect the marble filling?
She didn't wash the eggshells' inside???
Why english always do a weird thing? Dont used the shells after you make the hole through the eggs. It is wrong.
I used to watch "The Vicar of Dibley" and this woman sounds just like the dumb woman Alice. Obviously they come from the same place in England.
Wait how did ice come from north america?
I'm guessing you washed the inside of the egg shells?
She didn’t wash those eggshells :(
👍✳️👍✳️👍✳️
this is most bizarre egg dish
What's the lovely lady's name ?
how did i end up here...
I’m stoned right now and want to travel back in time to this woman’s kitchen
Ewwwwwww i'm sorry but blowing eggs into a bowl then handing said bowl to your servant girl to make an omelette is gross
wasn't paying attention at the part where she was blowing the eggs and wondered why not just crack them normally? XD I am slightly an idiot here hahaa
Um how did she clean the shells from the raw egg
It looked like she was blowing her nose
I'll be doing this come Easter. Except, rather than using a mixture of flour and water to seal the one end of the egg, I'll be using candle wax. This is going to be fun!
Yummy!
I can't even conceive of what texture cream set with gelatin would have.. are they wiggly or more like a gummi candy?
She looks so head weight
What slabs of chocolate do you use in your recipes? I would like to buy the brand, it looks so tasty.
O love this but its irking me so badly she didn't somehow clean those blown eggs. Yuk raw egg & cream!
😱did they really blow the eggs back then?? It’s a weird method of getting the eggshell😅 never heard of it until now haha .
I wonder if there are some eggshells in the marbled eggs from the hole poked in the shell that didn’t fall out the other end.
Lol it looked like she was blowing some infection out of her nose!
Is this a popular Easter dish in the UK still? I live in the US and I’ve never heard of marbled eggs until this video!
I thought the blonde kitchen maid was Mary Anne? In the Christmas cake video she calls her Mary Anne and in this one they call her Sylvia....must be twins.
🐣🐣🐣 Lovely video 🐣🐣🐣
Hmm...this doesn't look very appetizing (at least in terms of texture (I don't like gelatinous textures)). I tried to google this and couldn't find it anywhere else, as I wonder, what would the texture of this be like when you eat it? Is it flan-like, or is it even firmer than that?
Wait... did she put the chocolate stuff in the eggshells in still raw egg? Or do they somehow wash them?
Does the smell of raw egg on the desert bother anyone. or is it just me? do they wash the egg shells once drained?
We did that egg thing, blowing out the inside...exempt that my little brother accidentally suck the egg in his mouth.. didn’t try to make another one...
It’s a great video, and I cracked when she said modern house
You are lucky to live in Catholic country. Orthodox religion uses real eggs. It is boring
Ew, no thanks.
Why is the egg in the middle so much larger than the other eggs?
I think blowing is not enough for removing all egg white out of the shell, but it sounds like she did not care about that, so there should be some raw egg white in the chocolate egg, shouldn't there?
Oh all i ever want to do is to blow those eggs
But where is cucumber ?
I COME BACK FROM A LONG AND TERRIBLE DAY AT WORK TO THIS AND I COULDNT BE HAPPIER
... chickens can be vaccinated. I feel so cheated by the egg industry where I live. It’s not the hens fault! It’s the conditions and vaccinations!
How did they survive without rubber spatulas??lol I’d hate to leave so much in the bowl.
Calves feet 😯😯😯😅😅😅
The egg holder looks like a test tube holder
Are the egg shells supposed to be ringed out before putting the cream in them?
Did she say she use to make gelatin from cows feet? How does that even work?
Hehehe use silicon or plastic egg moulds every corner of earth has thoes in 2018
If you want to do this but want to avoid the danger of salmonella all together u can use well washed plastic eggs like you use for egg hunting just cut a hole in the top with a razor and wash the debris out then fill the egg. When it is set just open the egg in the middle like normal. Since the mold isn't part of the final dish then who would know you did it nontraditionally
Hey I’m new here, what year is this supposed to be set in?
Another modern option to coping with the salmonella aspect is to use pasteurized eggs if you can afford it.
Is there a more hygenic way to do it without blowing inside the egg?
Pause at 0:10 Heyyy I don't think this was filmed in the 18th century!  There's a lightswitch on the wall!
3:34 duuuude i dont wanna be gross but..
it looks like she s taking them out of her noseeeee😨😨😨😨
Mrs. Crocombe needs her own series, an entire half hour of Victorian cooking and house keeping, throw in some embroidery for variety.
ya had me until “now the bird is cold” and “cover in mayonnaise”... looks great up until then, after..nope!!
After the turkey boiled, brush with some garlic butter, and broiled in the oven, then served it with some mushroom & caramelized onion gravy, alongside some mashed potatoes.
not going to lie, this one sounds really disgusting xD but I'm fascinated by domestic history, i really enjoy these videos, I hope theres lots more to come =) EDIT Oh wow, the attention this one got LOL Yeah, I'm fond of a cold cut myself but I don't know,  it sounds like a bizarre combination stuffed into boiled poultry and then slathered in mayo~ick xD
Are Lord and Lady Braybrooke aware of Mrs Crocombe making videos?
Me: Wow! That sounds pleasnt
Mrs Crocombe: Before you boil it...
Me: Oh. Nevermind.
Thank you for making these clear spoken, interesting and well filmed videos. They are such fun to watch.
I guess... if you're going to put mayo on your sandwich of cold cuts anyway... same difference... but, still....
love this series but covering the bird in mayonnaise really looks gross haha
IM OBSESSED WITH THIS SERIES PLEASE MAKE MORE
I dont even eat meat....but I love this woman!!! I watch just for her......and the various vessels used for cooking.....the English...I love them!!!
I can see why a lot of people died during the Victorian Era. Please more of these. I live to see you do these old recipes.
I watch this channel just for her cooking 🤗
I would love to also see the other people who run the house that she often talks about. Victorian gardening tips with the gardener, cleaning/decorating tips with the maid, etc.
You lost me at ‘cover it in mayonaise and serve cold’. No offense to you as it seems to be a traditional dish but it doesn’t sound too appetizing if I’m honest :’)
I'm a bit unsure about the mayonnaise 🤔, and so much of it but the actual bird looks delicious inside.  I don't remember any salt but who cares, I just love to see this lady cook  and how she talks as if she's gossiping. 😊
Yes Mrs Crocombe again i love her so much
What? No cucumber???
Tasty who??? Haha! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SERIES!
Now, we need the video for the Roastbeef as centerpiece of the Christmas table  😱😱
Yes, Shes back! I've been waiting!
I adore this series and hope English Heritage keeps the videos coming. Happy Holidays to all!
I FKING LOVE MRS CROCOMBE
Just got home from work Christmas party and even tho I'm very drunk and Vegetarian I still have time to watch Mrs Crocombe cook a turkey lol. 
Love you! 😊
Lots of comments mention about brown paper n mayonese..ofcourse brown paper is peeled off,It's the turkey skin that many mistake to be brown paper..and regarding mayonese, olden days cooking are obviously different from our new generation cooking style..they tried and tested many recipes In different methods which subsequently gave us the recipes which we hav now.so lets not judge them..i love how these guys post detailed ingredients list n method in description box.
Please don't cook my country!
I see a lot of persons disguisted with this, but, as a french person, I have to say that galantine is a pretty common charcuterie in France, made like a big sausage cut in slight slices, with chicken, pork and pistachios. And it's quite good ! (I admit the amount of mayonnaise is a bit extreme, but once again, handmade mayonnaise is nothing like industrial one). I guess that with all our charcuterie, we are used to cold cooked meats so I'm cool with it  ^^  I would never have thought that it was such a classy dish in the victorian era though ! Thanks Mrs Crocombe !
This woman could make roast opossum on a stick and I'd watch it!  I LOVE this series!!  I would love to see one of how the roast beef that would have been served for Christmas dinner is cooked.
Sometimes I think you really come from the past...
What about the thread ? Wouldn’t it look awkward while slicing the turkey and the thread also comes out ?
"Like a parcel"💕💕💕
I can physically feel my endorphins being released
I love all ur cooking vids :D i wish u guys upload them more
Ms. Crocombe can speak for hours and I'll be willing to listen with perseverance. She sounds soothing and everything about this video feels like home.
I'm impressed by how seamlessly you remain in character. A very entertaining video, indeed. Great work!
this is like vintage american all over again with that smear of mayo and bizarre decoration style
This recipe lost me at coating of mayonnaise and gelatin yeah that's just gross
Hit like first, then I started watching!
Glad to have filled in the survey.  This video has been a treat!  Love them all and I agree with the comment below.  Mrs Crocombe does need her own series of not less than thirty minutes per episode.  Many thanks!  Also, could you do videos exploring the work done by the other servants?  We need this cookbook in the earliest possible time-frame!  A really big, gorgeous one with lots of lovely in costume pictures!  The china!  The linen!  The dining table!  The glitz!
I started watching 18th Century Cooking this year and these videos were suggested to me. I would love to see a video with Mrs Crocombe and John Townsend cooking and discussing the similarities/differences between the 18th century colonial and Victorian cooking. Thank you English Heritage, Mrs Crocombe and Audley House for this series and I am very anxious to see more. This is the type of cooking shows that I like, not the pompous asses (being polite) that are offered by Food Network and the like.
But wait ..Where is cucumber ?
0:43 

I thought that was rice....
While some viewers have said that Mrs. Crocombe should host a show of her own, clearly, this would be a challenge.  What I wish is that a series similar to the marvelous "Victorian Kitchen" with the late Ruth Mott might be produced showing how the kitchens of a country estate operated on a daily basis, both upstairs and down.  The aforementioned series was removed from YouTube after only a short period of time.  I believe it was a series of six episodes featuring Dinner, Lunch, Tea, Picnic's, Breakfast, and Supper.
Who else is in love with this series 😍😍😍
I keep watching the same episodes over and over again because I cant  stop watching and I love this lady 😳
The one dislike was probably from someone who tried to do this but failed.
We need MORE MRS CROCOMBE!!
They didn't use salt back then??
I'm fascinated by these videos. Much appreciated!
I only subbed to watch her
I love British accent 

They sound lovely like its a language of a fairy tale 😆💗🌸
Oh, I'm so glad I'm not at THIS Christmas table!
I've made a similar recipe on several occasions. I roasted the turkey instead of boiling it, and I served it hot. My stuffing was more basic and savory (sausage meat with sage, thyme, rosemary, etc.)

You can use the bones to make stock while you roast the bird, which can be used for a great gravy. It's also very easy to carve in the end.
Simple splendid, Mrs. Crocombe.
I could watch her videos every day!!
Happy Christmas Mrs. Crocombe.
Please never stop making these!
“A medium sized bird might take an hour and a half but I think mine might take a bit longer” odd flex but okay Mrs Crocombe
I deboned and stuffed my turkey for Thanksgiving, but I roasted mine in an oven.
Don’t forget, back then the mayonnaise would be probably home-made, which is quite different from what we are used to, I imagine. It’s got much more delicate taste.
What does this taste like? Doesn’t look very appetizing lol
Cooked with Elegance.....
I'm so hungry
It looks delicious to me. Apparently, I am an isolated case LOL
Godness this recipe is horrible but somehow fascinating to watch
i love watching these episodes but this recipe has me retching 🤮 but this lady is so pleasant and lovely to watch thank you for filming
The only reason I am subscribed to this channel. LOVE anything with Mrs. Crocombe!
Merry Christmas Mrs Crocombe and to English Heritage! 😊🎄
"I've deboned my turkey... WHICH IS A BIT OF A JOB!" Hahahaha I don't know why I laughed so hard on this.

Anyways, amazing video as always. Love your videos Mrs. Crocombe! :D
I'm not a great fan of boiled meat but I'd love to try this out :D 

Just discovered that Allspice is actually a sort of Jamaican pepper.
I absolutly love these videos. But the food...that's where the "special" reputation of british cooking comes from
You really should replace that suet and roast that turkey, in my opinion.

Edit: Wait its cold?
Edit 2: Mayo!?
Edit 3: this lowkey sounds like a dish from the 1960s
This series is my everything
You had me up until mayonnaise ... (with gelatin?!?) 🤢
I was all for it until we got to the boiling.  I'm sure that would have treated amazing had it been baked (I'm not one for mayo so I'd probably not coat it)

But this is a recipe I think I'll try
What a lovely character performed by very professional and also lovely actress, god bless this channel and god bless the england
If "galatine of turkey" or whatever turns out to be meat jello Im gonna throw hands with Mrs. C
Edit: okay I think it's safe, it's just some kind of weird invasive turkey loaf
Edit #2: oh my GOD she puts mayonnaise jello on it I hate this
SECOND great video as always keep the good work up!
Why you put lemon in EVERY recipe??
Wow. I do this every year but it looks a lot better than your (as the Victorians would have said), "pigs breakfast".
I just discovered this channel not long ago, and while I do agree with many on here that this preparation of turkey is unappealing (I'd definitely prefer it roasted and not covered in anything, save for 'maybe' a sweet sauce of some kind), I do also understand that this was how it was done during (as the title implies) the Victorian era.  I still love not just this video, but this whole channel regardless!  Looking forward to watching what is already here, and what is yet to come!
I feel like watching tutorial from my past life. Love this channel!
This looks so gross 😩
I think the string needed to be removed before the turkey was covered in mayo...
That mayonnaise I can't just the thought made me gag
Watching this after the holidays are over gives me an intense separation anxiety. I miss the holidays! I’ll be looking forward to this year’s December holidays 😊
1:07 I love how she says "which is a BIT of a job"
Why the Brits must Boil everything it would be so good roasted
This is so wonderful! Love the vintage and proper way and presentation. Performance is never out of character. Love this series and character.
Imagine your family shows up for Christmas dinner and you plop that down on the table. Accompanied by cucumber pudding and followed by cucumber ice cream.
I do like to watch these videos.. but good lord this is the worst recipe by far.
I love your recipes. I'm allergic to nuts so something tells me I would have passed away early in this era due to so many recipes calling for nuts.
Has anybody else noticed that almost everything that she cooks has gelatin in it?!😐😐😐🤷🏾‍♂️
you need to do this more often. like upload regulary i mean. make it stable. please.
Do serve as well to know how it's eaten... 
  And the masalas (All spice and coriander)  must have been imported from India?
I live for this series. Makes me feel so nostalgic for my great grandmother's cooking. Just beautiful!
Thank you for the recipe. Please keep these videos coming.
This looked so amazing!  ... Until the mayonnaise Dx
“And now cover with with mayonnaise”

Nope...
No...
...
......
...
..no....


((Still love this video though))
Love the way Mrs Crocombe explains everything...makes it simple to understand....👍
I love the confidence. Will u marry me?
Another wonderful recipe and presentation! Thank you for sharing!
Subscribed! I love channels like yours and jas Townsend and sons.  Cooking has always been an integral part of history after all.
Bro that bird look deflated
Ohh pero que increible!!!! Muy buen gusto
This looks gross ! But I love mrs crocomb ❤️ from Pakistan
Wish u had your show everyday would be a pleasure to watch and learn ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Couldn't u just make them a turckey sanwich on white bread with mayo lol
Holyyyy that looks divine!😍😍 somehow the turkey reminds me of Mr. Bean episode where his head was stuck inside the turkey😂
Am I the only one who finds Mrs. Crocombe's voice so relaxing? Like the one that one would hear from an English grandmother?
There's something oddly soothing about these videos. Mrs. Crocombe seems like a lady with a plan for everything.
To live the Victorian way in that house for just a day would be so much fun
I have just found this great channel n Love it 💖,  i collect enamelwear, where would i find a measuring cup like yours? Help 😊
I love Mrs. Crocombe, but any self-respecting American would wail in horror at that mayonnaise business.
I've been vegan my whole life and I can't stand the sight of meat. But I always make an exemption for this Mrs. Crocombe videos
Her: Armonds 
Me: 😍😍😍👌🏻
Loved the video, just like ALL your other videos. I'll be trying out the recipe never. :')
English Heritage, how those small spears Mrs Crocombe perfurated the turkey with are called?
the only videos i watch of english heritage is mrs. crocombe 🤣😅😂

i dont even cook
I'm not sure about seeing this bird on my holiday table ever. Still a nice video. Thanks for posting.
You had me until it was  - boiled - AND served cold? Oof. 

These old recipes kill me. But I looove the history of it, and that Mrs. Crocombe is so knowledgeable 💗
I notice that many of the wonderful things you make are served cold. Was that because it was difficult to keep items warm from kitchen to table in the Victorian Era?
I love watching her cook and hopefully we see her doing decorations or anything too.
Man I am so excited these are back!
🤢🤢🤢🤢 mayo?? And boiled Turkey with stuffing inside 😝😝😝😝😝 lol guess all the recipes can't be winners with me. Still fun to watch 🤗
EEEEkkkkkk the ending was the roast mayo boiled beast of Whoville eeeee EEEkkk
When she slathered it in Mayo I just about gagged 😩 ... But I love this series.
Bende sandım türklerle ilgili bi video gerçekten öyleymiş :D
Some coriander two flakes of coriander fall into the bowl ah, seasoning
This Channel is Absolutely Amazing 😀
Once I heard it was served cold, I noped right out of this recipe. lol But still a fascinating watch!
My dear Mrs. Crocombe! I adore your videos! You are an outstanding and creative cook and instructress! Many blessings to you and your lord and manor!
Love this woman. Absolutely addicted to her! 
But i cringe every time she says "armonds". Lol
Oh well.
„How to Make Scones“ pleaseeee ☕️
I really enjoy watching this Lady cooking. Wish there be more vids of her. Congratulations from the Caribbean and Merry Christmas! 🙌🙏👍
"Served cold" I said ew but okay, and then they said to spread mayonnaise with gelatin in it all over it, I just went NO THANKS
Hello
You must try some popular Indian dishes. They have innumerable varieties and tastes. Lord and Lady would surely love it. Good luck !
4:49

What on EARTH?

Hahahahaha, old cooking is weird sometimes. X'D

Tenderly mend your dinner like a mitten. 
Bundle it up like a baby. 
Dip it in for a nice long hot bath. 
Take it out.
Then you just SLATHER that sucker with a two-inch sheet of Jell-O Mayo. 
Decorate it old-fashion T.V antenna bunny-ears style... don't forget those pickled walnuts....???????


Seriously, the only normal part of this whole thing was the parsley.
The humble bragging in her videos kills me. I love it
This channel makes me proud to be of English decent.
You could be on Martha Stewart's cooking show!!!!!!!! I would like to make it with chicken!!!
I now would like the recipe for the pickled walnuts, please :)
I'm so in love with this cuz black Butler 😂😂
Add your loaf to your turkey sleeping bag et voila!
I love this lady❤! I'm not even English
Super impressive! So glad I found this show.
This looks delicious! I'm certainly going to give it a try. Funny how people think the mayo is odd, but I've never had a cold turkey sandwich without mayo. Turkey without mayo is gross (too dry).
Lost me at it's cold and cover it in mayonnaise.  Before that I was ready to eat.
I suppose to be studying... But I can't stop watching her videos!!!!  Help!!!
Absolutely fantastic!  I don't understand the outrage at covering the turkey with mayonnaise.  No one is going to eat the whole of the mayonnaise.  Each guest will get only the mayo that is in the slice of turkey he gets.  Sounds delicious!
Should have taken off the string before covering with the mayonaise !!!!!
Since everyone's so perturbed now, the next video should be a fish in aspic. High roller stuff 😁
you had me up to the mayo
This should be on Netflix
I just adore this lady. she's perfect..Merry Christmas
What's with the British and the boiling of stuff
I run to this video
1:49
British cuisine in a nutshell.
this is so fancy. i need a second monocle
I have to say.i looks wonderful.  Maybe one I make my own
Capturing the essence of that era is great. But the recipe is an epic failure. Never mind the mayo smothered, boiled whole turkey- leaving the threads in - guests will have extra twine fibre in their morsels.
Can't wait to try the dressing also the Turkey. I think it would be good violets with some beer.
A bet a bit of salt and served warm would have taken that dish from a 4 to a 9.
That is very elaborate for a side dish, but then again tis Christmas feast!
this one sounds icky lol, mayo-gelatin glaze and pickled walnuts?? what happened to the celery and carrots??
If YouTube was invented in the Victorian times
Please make more vid I love yr Chanel so much !!
Great dinner!! So lovely made by the Victorian way 👌👌👌 ... Victorian era and Victorian style 👍👍👍👍 Great thanks to you and your lovely video 😍😍😍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Hey Avis, how did you make  coffee during your time?
I really enjoy this series 💕💕
No hablo inglés, pero este canal me encantó y ya me suscribí 💖
Watching these videos makes me realize how cooking has evolved so much. But one thing hasn't changed a bit, our love for good food. ❤
I love these videos, but this one just reminded me of Captain America saying that back in the day they used to boil everything
Remove the strings then add the gelatin coating. You can press great stuff into a setting 🐦.
When she said she was going to boil it I said NOOO! When she covered it in mayonnaise and planned to serve it cold I said NOOOOOOOO!
Am I the only who wanna see Lady Braybrooke makes an appearance sometimes?
Would you do the ham same way with brown paper bag, and cheese cloth.
Have you made fudge yet
Oh my lord... what did they do to that turkey? 😮🤢🤮
All I can think of is how much my grampy would love these! He passed two years ago but he loved stuff like this. These are so interesting and these recipes were So unique
I'm a vegetarian the only reason I'm watching this is for its adorable englishness
You had me until the mayonaise
basically its steamed instead of roasted, I think I would rather have one roasted
I get so excited when I see a new video. Great job!!
the production quality! I love these
OK, now I want to buy the whole turkey to cook it :D it looks absolutely amazing
I would love to try this it looks so good & I am sure it will taste delicious. The deboning part I wonder if I can succeed. I love your channel, thank you for sharing your recipes.
Love this - BUT the music is wayyyy too loud!!!!!
I am drooling here! That looks so good.
I absolutely love her videos and how she stays in character the whole time. Thank you
i swear this recipe came right out of The Legend of Zelda: BOTW
Is it just me or it kinda look like a huge butter at the end lol.
The whole presentation of this video is like traveling back in time to watch them cook traditional meal
'Sgust! 
I don't delight in this recipe 
😞
what's the matter with mayo?? i like it, seems nice..
You had me all the way up until the mayonnaise part lol love these videos!
Please don’t ever stop making these videos with Ms. Crocombe!!!!
Ah, thank you Mary-Anne.
It looked GREAT before the mayonnaise! That's where ya lost me.
The way she says almonds gives me anxiety
I guess the food tasted so much better back then... better ingredients and slow cooking
girlll when she pulled out that mayonnaise i dipped 😭😭😭
Mayo-jello sounds so cringe-worthy. Up until then I was so ready to make a Victorian Turkey.
Loved this. I admire anyone who can debone a chicken!
The repetitive music was maddening to me! But I love the show!
:D I didn't know galantines was such an old fashion technique. I've done ballotines before, this looks great!
You should be on TV. Love the presentation, clarity and clear instruction etc. Absolutely Wonderful.
While it does seem odd to modern palates im sure we have dish's they would find equally weird.  Great video as always!
Yum Yum!!  Wonderful videos. Many thanks for all the hard work that went into making this. Kind regards and greetings from Africa.
I'm in the Christmas spirit and it's only September thanks to Mrs.Corcombe
That was disgusting but I love watching the process! More videos please!
I want to try pickled walnuts
the mayonnaise really shook me
i thought she was going to bake it at first, and when i heard "boil" I wasn't surprised, and lost interest instantly. I fast forwarded to the end, just to see if it's as bad as i thought it would look.
I love this series so much.

As I was writing this comment, I misread the subtitle; "sausage meat" to "savage meat" 😂😂 Oh boi 😂😂
Lord and Lady Braybrooke sound like nice people
Ah yes let’s add apples to give the stuffing some moisture before WE BOIL IT
1:20 will depend on the size of your bird......👉🏼👌☺️
MAYONNAISE?!?! COLD TURKEY?! 🤮🤮🤮🤮
I'm always fascinated by historical dishes which have fallen out of fashion.  Thank you for what, to a modern audience, is a rather unusual dish.  As always, a beautiful production with the lovely Mrs Crocombe.
I find myself watching Mrs Crocombe's videos again and again, they work like a sort of ASMR for me beside giving me ideas for my own cooking and improving my English.
Love these videos. I could eat turkey 3 times a day, every day. I love it so much.
I greatly appreciate this videos and I like the process but I did not like the end result xD
I love to watch random vids and this past in my feed so i watch it and its interesting aaaghhhh cant stop watching this
When I see Mrs. Crocombe, all my worries and anxieties flutter away.
Please start your own series! I adore you so much!
I really enjoy this channel. I'm a Bostonian and my last name and heritage is English so it's nice to learn about my heritage in all ways.
What is it with the English and their boiled meats? Love ya Mrs. C!
I'll have myself a Turkey too for Christmas 😀😍
If only they had put the mayo on before cooking it and then roasted it. we might have some delicious crispy skin happening here
Tried this last Christmas, roasted instead of boiled (leave off the muslin of course and oil the outside of the bird) it was amazing! :) Hmmm ... might need to do it again for Easter!
I was totally on board with this until she said it was going to be boiled and served cold covered in mayo.
It depends on the size of your bird😂
People think they hate mayo, until they eat it without knowing.

I wife used to claim she hated mayo and sour cream. I cook with it all the time, use it in salads soups. She will go on and on about how good something is.
I just LOVE this Victorian cooking series!!
Well made/produced, great leading lady! 
Been experimenting in the kitchen all week!
Yay!! ANOTHER VICTORIAN WAY VIDEO!! 😍😍 The only reason I subbed. 😘😘
Legit made some of these recipes. They're actually really good!
I do so love your cooking demonstrations. They are most soothing.
She looks quite similar to my aunt. It's creepy as she is into Steampunk (Victorian-style with an industrial twist) and loves cooking.
I was expecting the boned stuffed bird to go in the oven and come out beautifully browned.
You could actually just do this with a turkey breast. You don't need an entire bird, de-boned. Too much work
Why is watching this lady cook my guilty pleasure 😂
I would love to hear you read a book or anything
Please do ham!  A beautiful honey glazed ham!
For us Indians, that is like the first step out of 10 steps of cooking the turkey 😂
I thougt the turkey was ging to be stuffed in the oven not boiled!
Well yes. The amount of stuffing will depend on the size of my bird
Don’t freak out about the mayo on the outside, it’s just a layer on the outside and the inside contents of turkey greatly outweigh it, for a probably perfect flavor combo
This has me wanting to rewatch Downton Abbey, lol...ah, what the heck!
I couldn't afford therapy so I came here
✨⭐️🎄✨⭐️🎄✨⭐️✨. MERRY CHRISTMAS to all fellow ENGLISH HERITAGE viewers .                           What a dish , fit for a Queen !
It's named after the french word guillotine because any cook crazy enough to serve this for Christmas dinner was promptly beheaded on Boxing Day.
What in the unseasoned fresh hell...😳 however I love her voice and seemingly no nonsense personality so she could make about anything and I would watch.
I'm gonna be honest I watch these videos on repeat. Ms. Crocombe's voice is so soothing🙈
Love her!!!
She had me until the mayo part 🤣
I wonder if the muslin fabric was washed and re-used?
I didn’t know u could put mayo on turkey ? But okay 💀
This made my day a whole lot better XD
Congratuletions ☺☺😊😊
Who’s stuffing your turkey Mrs. Crocombe?
She had me until she said cover the bird in mayo... 😂😂😂
Boiled turkey covered with gelatined mayo? 😝
I wish you a merry Christmas too!!!
Is gelatin also pronounced as Galatin ... ???
This only confirms that Britain has one of the most creatively disgusting cuisines in the world. Ironically, they have best chefs live Ramsay
NO SHE DID NOT!!! Dam, that was rough!!
I would die and kill for Mrs. Crocombe but this is a strange dysh :O
I stoped acting blind in public for this
Deboning a Turkey Mrs Crocombe?
I should say..Yes quite a job indeed..
honestly if I saw that on my Christmas table I'd call the police
EVERYONE!!!! fill out the survey, the link is at the top of the comments!!!! 
like so everyone can see
i wanna see Lord and Lady Braybrooke!
She doesn't even cut off the strings after the bird is cooked? Covers it in mayonnaise? Gross...
Mayonaise, Mayonaise with Gelatine in it... shudders yucky lol was great till then! lol
Türklərdə belə yeməyin olduğunu ilk dəfədiy görürəm)) Əlasız😍
I thought the traditional bird eaten at Christmas during this period was goose?
Doph! She put the mayonnaise on before she removed the strings! Whoopsie... I doubt Lord and Lady Brayburn enjoyed that!
Interesting recipe but boiled poultry is not to my taste... Glad I wasn't born in that time.
Upon seeing the end results I've realized my  ass would have been so skinny in Victorian times.  Nice video though.
I wish more videos would be updated frequently !
Hey @EnglishHeritage I was wondering, are you in a way a rival to the national trust? Just wondering please reply 😁
Do Lord and Lady Braybrooke eat the brown paper too??
She looks Portuguese. Like, really 😮
I love your videos big hug from Mexico
Mayo...how do you refuse in Vic polite way?
Well, not suitable for my family’s Christmas dinner—blah!
I don’t know why but I love this series so much
Wait? Cold... That's interesting
For a proper Victorian kitchen, see the Victorian Kitchen series, made by  the BBC in the 1990s,  featuring Ruth Mott.
Mary Ann is going to steal all the recipes!
Boiled boneless turkey slathered in mayonnaise.

Pity the poor Victorian Saxons and their hideous food.
“You had me at Maaaayyooo”....😂 I hate myself for this
I was all about this until she slathered it in mayo...
I’ll have to skip this one.
Turkey de-boned, stuffed, poached, covered with mayonnaise and served cold 😝
What would Gordon Ramsay say when he sees this
I have to keep reminding myself that proper, homemade mayonnaise tastes a lot better than the modern version.
Gordon Ramsay is screaming rn
I don’t think chef Ramsay would like this tbh
How big is that room i can her echo, you should make that kitchen more homie
All spice isn’t the only spice/seasoning in the world.
Why am I watching this


Why am i so intrigued
I love these videos and Mrs Crocombe!
It was so good until... the mayonnaise :o
It was so good until you said it would be served cold and covered in mayo.
Would think have been eaten on it's own, or sliced and placed onto bread/rolls/etc?
I never know butter could be chopped and still look solid because here in the tropics, butter melts almost immediately and u can barely cut the butter without squashing it
I'm not too sure about the whole quarter inch of gelatin/mayo on the outside of the turkey, but then again the Victorians probably wouldn't be so sure about guacamole, chimichurri sauce, lobsters as fine dining or sushi.
I'm actually wanting to see how this tastes. It intrigues me now. 🤔
Just watching the culture be brought to life is amazing, it would be an amazing series to watch
Has Mrs. Crocombe done goose? I cannot find it if she has. Don't listen to the nay sayers, that turkey sliced thin on some good bread would be a great sandwich. What would have been served instead of cranberry sauce?
Well-you know-just cover this cold turkey carcus in mayonnaise. Plus-some pickled nuts. Yummy.
At 1:18 - 'the amount of stuffing you need will depend on the size of your bird' - Oh, I say … outrageous !
WOW!!!! I Love the idea of stuffing the deboned bird.. I had no idea it was called Gallantine.  I've done the breast stuffed... and done the legs stufffed... but never the whole thing.  I like it hot and browned.  This sounds interesting though. I hpe to try it sometimes... Maybe in the summer when it's 110* here and we need a cold dish.  Thank you for such an Elegant and Excellent presentation.
That looks racid, but I am obsessed with Mrs Crocombes videos
Great video, as always. Could you also create a video on how to roast a Christmas goose with crispy skin? Goose is my favorite for Christmas dinner.
In the US you have to ask a specialized butcher shop to debone or grind something. Regular super markets are not allowed to do anything.
I wanna know the backstory of this lady😂😂
I guess a lot of things are served cold in December in that giant house with high ceilings. Brrr.
She makes the past so much fun!! (My favorite subject is History in school)
yes let’s cover my turkey in mayonnaise. perfect.
what a delight dish looks amazing
Personally, after boiling, I would've nuked that baby in the oven after covering it in a herb and garlic butter just to give the skin a nice finish ;)
ASMR all over the place
"so I'm going to cover it with mayonnaise" 

aaaaAAAAAAAAA?????????
63rd comment and 1 hour from the upload!
Got to say - that looks disgusting! Love these videos though!
I'm sorry that looks absolutely ghastly! Mayonnaise The Pickled walnuts the way it's presented .
Everything sounded great until "it will be served cold."
I want to stuff a bird too !
sure enjoy watchin yer videos...
...pickled walnuts...
Eeeek....!
1:04 well everything done in victorian way is a bit of a job 😂
I died when she pulled out the giant needle and threadn
I wonder if it would be tastey baked in an oven, without the nice mayo geletin glaze at the end.
You'd have to have a good deal of patience to debone a chicken or turkey.  Poultry has a good many little bones.
Love these Victorian cooking videos 💕
That is beautyful and looks delicious
I can’t stand mayo so no thanks.
had me all the way until the mayo
In my country we call this "matambre"
I reckon the stock would be aromatic and pleasantly palatable, but the bird...Humbly to speak, it would be fine with no greasy and oily stuff. Only parsley and kale to garnish are good.
That looks flipping delicious!!!!
add some ..... and then add the whole bowl :))
Gordon Ramsay would not like this :)
I was pretty on board until she said it was a cold dish, then slathered it in gelatine-mayonnaise, and decorated it with turds - cough - I mean pickled walnuts.
Usually I dislike a boiled bird, but this looks lovely!
This is a great video, but that turkey looks distasteful.
As an American, I'm appalled at this treatment of our national dish. Boiling a stuffed turkey?
I'm so obsessed with this series and of course, Mrs Crocombe!A cookbook is fabulous but I liked to have Mrs Crocombe's line of cookware.Everything she uses looks so pretty.I just finish filling up the survey.
Google galantine... no wonder folks expected something else here since its ANOTHER french term.
I love the video's. But if anyone ever put that on the table with Christmas I'm not eating it. I prefer my Turkey roasted.
Oh God, the Mayonnaise.
I don’t know why, but I am fascinated with this, it:s just so....idk
Eew ew ew No. But fascinating
Is anyone else kind of upset that this recipe doesn't include SALT?
I want a series. A million videos. Now!
I love these videos, but man that turkey looked gross. The boiled turkey skin, plus gelatin, plus mayo. shudder
This sounds like Anglo-North America at Thanks Giving. In French North America, we have Meat pie and a kind of stew we call "Ragou".
Mayo?  Were these Victorians Southern ??
I can't get enough of these videos.
Seems like they ate simple foods but dressed the up nice. Recognizable ingredients. Not all this chemical stuff we eat nowadays
Her voice is always soothing
I’m sure it’s pretty good but the decorating is so dated lol. It’s pretty amazing that decorating food like that has only been out of fashion for like 50 years
Oh no no no no. Now I need to costume myself up and cook historical Christmas dinner.... yes yes yes yes. So glad I discovered this channel!
I love Mrs Crocombe and this series, learning about all the cookery and housekeeping! 
I really liked this recipe right up until it was boiled and served cold covered in mayo (shudder).  
Please keep these coming!
Oh I have to remember this for National Turkey Lovers Day!
She's officially my religion. All hail Goddess Crocombe
I find it odd that mayo was used in Victorian recipes. I thought it was a relatively new food item
It looks sooooo delicious although it's not very beautiful 😂
You had me until the coating of mayo 😂
I half expected to see a cucumber again.
I love that you put mayonnaise over the Turkey.  Surely tastes wonderful. In my country we also add mayonnaise over dishes, looks gross but tastes delicious
Ive been wondering for a while how do you pronounce Ms Crombe's name?
Kathy Hipperson does an amazing job!
It’s not even funny how much I absolutely adore these videos...I just wish there were more!!!
Well it certainly looks unique. Once I saw a Tudor documentary and they redid a favorite recipe of them....and it was BAD so I really hope this tastes good
Can't believe people used to eat cold turkey like that & covered in mayonnaise too. Good grief. Thank God for the 21st century. Just disgusting
Love this program!!! <3
Wonderful! An absolutely fantastic meal! I am sure Lord and Lady Braybrooke enjoyed that dinner very much. I hope this message finds you doing quite well Mrs.Crocombe!
You can always take the skin off in one piece and wrap the contents in the skin rather than muslin and bake it.
bu yaptığınız yemek nedir doğrusu bilmiyorum ilk kez sizde görüyorum.
You need a new mixing bowl.
Too many commentators here acting like they've never eaten cold turkey.
I'm fascinated by this series and period cookery
I'm peruvian, and we here had our own way to cook the turkey during the Christmas season. But I'm sure that this turkey is definitely delicious (I hope I could try to cook it this year) , also many of her recipes. This lady really needs her own session and a website too.
Oh god no not the mayonnaise
Hello Againnnnn 😍😍😍😍
Please give this lady her own show.
I love this show, but mayo and no fridge oh boy
I really love your videos. just seeing how it was done in the past , let's me appreciate what I have now. boiling a whole Turkey... who knew.. thought it would be baked or smoked.
I'm obsessed with this series
"Mayonnaise has gelatin"
wut
I think I need an "How to Make Mayonnaise - The Victorian Way"
iiwould cry if my Mom served this...ever
Mayo? Mayo! Where the cranberries sauce?!
The best thing about this series is they don’t try to be picture perfect. They don’t cut cakes into symmetrical visually pleasing shapes. They don’t go out of their way to buy a perfect flawless looking cooking apple.
They know the food is tasty, and that’s all that matters.
greeeeaaaaaatttttt work bravo
great series, but am i the only one hearing mrs crocombe say "aRmonds", instead of "aLmonds"?
I adore this series! Thank you.
Love the bowls!!! 👍🏼
Not entirely on board with everything that happened to the bird after the 4:34 mark... lol
Yeay! We love Mrs. Crocombe! 😍
Her utensils are impeccable
No salt ?! Boiled in brown paper ? It's insane !
U lost me at the end
Awe hell nah. That white lady decorated raw turkey with mayonnaise.
Soon I'm going to try and make one of these recipes!
Why serve it cold ? You should have your own cooking show. The viictorian way.
this lady is amazing!
Did she just say "zing"?
She definitely has a nicer way about her than Mrs. Patmore. #IMissDowntonAbbey
+English Heritage I would LOVE to see Ms Crocombe do a sticky toffee pudding!
Forerunner of the turducken!
This dish is similar to a Filipino dish(rellenong manok) served at Christmas. Except it's served hot using a chicken.
Yep, you lost me with this one... not saying I wouldn’t eat it but... it’s a strange one. 😂🧐
I love watching her series..but i dont think i would ever try stuffed boiled turkey with mayonnaise...i would roast it..
I wouldn't mind steaming Mrs. Crocombe's puddings!
It was fine until it was covered in mayonnaise.
That looks nasty i
although that looks disgusting, i reaaaaaaaally enjoy watching this series
Commenting as I watch. Did you just say boil???
Lord, do forgive me. Victorian era "cuisine" was downright PUTRID! UGGGHHHH😷
This isnt good. Totally different from the turkey in USA
I might it be more that one hour! wow well its a very peculiar taste Mayonaisse
Every time I see one of her videos is up I’m like “YASSS”.
What about salt? Needs salt, yo.
She had me until the mayonnaise. A little dab will do ya, but that looked like it had a proper 10 layers of it!!!
Also wouldn't mind seeing what poorer/servants made for themselves.
Maryann is going to be promoted
sounds yummy but I think I'd prefer it hot
Some arrrlmunds 😁
Of all hee recipes, this one is the least appetizing.
Y'all are cray cray if you think this ain't tasty it's got hella spices I'm sure it's yummy
I love these videos! More please
She didn't put any salt... And I think it was fine untill u covered it with mayo like what's up with that!?
Someone needs to give this woman her own spin off series on PBS
Armonds


I love this btw
Oh my....as an American I cannot understand serving this cold and covered in mayonnaise 😒
That's a lot of mayo lol
what is the tool that holds the mixing bowl at an angle? I suppose that is to help with the mixing. How can I get one?
Love your stuff! But you lost me at the mayo... LOL
Lord and Lady Braybrook’s daughter Augusta isn’t married.
I thought the bird would eventually get roasted, not sure about the mayo covering.
I'd kill Santa if this appears on my Christmas table.
Watching this at 3am. So hungry af 😭
I'm binge watching Mrs Crocombe
How do you eat that cold 🤢
She's amazing! Hopefully we'll get to see more of her ♥
Yasss the kween is back
Do a crossover episode with Townsend and Sons, please!
I LOVE LOVE THESE VIDEOSSS
You lost me at the mayonnaise lmao
That cold, boiled turkey dish covered in mayonnaise!...😖...
Oh God! Did she just slather the whole thing with mayo? by far the worst recipe!
i love these videos. and ive seen a few recipes I want to try myself but not the mayonnaise thing. i understand they may have eaten it like that but not me. excellent videos btw.
i was with it till the mayo
It seemed good until you said it was to be served cold and covered in mayo.
English Heritage has a good thing going with Mrs Crocombe and the house hold staff.
damn son english people be so damn weird bout their turkeys
turkey looks good, probably fed him lots of cucumbers XD
Why didn't she take the string before putting the mayo on?
Sorry, but it looks like a corps ready to be throw-over Bord. 😂LOL
I love these videos! 😊
I was on board until the mayo.
Did they roast turkey the way we do ? I would love a video in that if they did
shes really convincing
ADORABLE 🌸🌼🌻💜😘
The recipe look great however I did not see that the turkey was seasoned on the outside with salt and pepper.
The amount of stuffings you use is depends on the size of your bird😂 omg
i was all in until it was covered in mayo
This video showed up in my recommended ones . I imediately pressed the subscribe button before the video started , just because I loved the appearance of the lady❤️ and the chanel s name !!!
I love this recipes omg
Fowl...I mean, foul. 🤢🤮
I thought it would be odd to apply the mayonnaise on the turkey galantine without removing the strings.  After all the effort of removing the bones, the diners would have to slice the string at the dinner table.   In any case, Mrs. Crocombe is the chef. And it is still amazing
I was with it up until the coating of mayonnaise.
I was excited about the turkey until I saw it was boiled. The black way either fry or bake it.
Is there a vegan version of this?
You had me until covered in mayonnaise.
Mrs. Crocombe needs her lien tv show of this xd
I gotta say this one doesn't look yummy.
no..no no no no!
pickled....walnuts?
Lol now why did you have to ruin a nice Turkey with that sausage? Regardless, I can't help but enjoy these vids.
If I was a turkey, I would love to die and be transformed into such a beautiful dinner.
American Turkey for the win 🇺🇸
Am I the only one who heard “pickled walnuts “ at the end?? How do you pickle walnuts?! That sounds delicious. I really want to make this. I wonder if roasting it would make it come apart.
I adore this woman! Love watching this show.
that thing is drowning in mayonnaise lol
why cover it in brown paper? I understand the mudslinging,  to keep its shape and it closed.
great videos☺
Id do this but without the mayo
Truss it up, roast it and serve it hot with no mayo, and I'm in.
Completely fascinated with everything Mrs. Crocombe and her recipes! I just can't get past the slathering of mayonnaise.
I just found this channel and I am enjoying it so much!
The 381 dislikes are the people who failed to make this..!
That's one recipe they can keep.
I luv her she is amazing
Mrs. Crocombe,
What does the kitchen do with leftovers the family doesn't eat?
Thankyou kindly in advance.
Love these videos! 💖
It’s RAW!!
Who eats all the food you make?
This is delicious ,I have to make this recipe . My mother to me this is how my grandmother would prepare their turkey for Christmas . My grandmother was born in Guatemala, but she sound like a culinary genius.
1. Love Mrs. Crocombe. 2. God, the English will boil anything.
What?... Boiled Turkey?!
where can I buy suet and what brand? We don't have it here in belgium...
I hope she got a Christmas bonus for having to debone an entire turkey! It's like a turkey sandwich without the bread!
This is so fascinating. A few of my fellow American friends were a little taken aback by the coating of mayonnaise, but I reminded them that most people enjoy mayonnaise on a turkey sandwich, so what is the difference? Besides, you are going to eat a slice of it, you're not going to be licking the mayonnaise off the whole bird, for goodness' sake! Another well done video from Mrs. Crocombe and ENGLISH HERITAGE (of which I am a proud supporting member).
Lost me at the mayonnaise
i was down until she said it was served cold
why is everyone losing their minds with the turkey mayo combo? I'm I the only person that puts mayo on a turkey sandwich?
Had to look away when she stuffed the turkey😣
I love it!!! :D
Yeah I'm sure they used to grow pistachio trees,walnut trees and lemon trees lool... probably they've got those from the countries they stole from
I'd try it, but it is so not visually appealing. And cold? Nah.
Literally just discovered this channel.  I have a new love.  I will definitely be trying every one of these out.  Especially the pudding and mince pies.   I always wanted to make a true Victorian pudding or Mince pie.  Thank you for putting these here.
Please cut it next time :) so we can see the inside too
Enjoy your Mayo
I love these videos. The attention to detail is amazing. I noticed that the producers even found an apple that looked like it would have been normal back in the day due to discoloration that would not be considered appealing these days. Having said  this retro recipe looked utterly disgusting.  It went downhill fast after the cold turkey was brought out and slathered with gelatinous mayonnaise. I definitely won't be recreating this one, but I will look forward the the next video in this series.
She lost me after "boil meat."
Mrs. Crocombe ...... I would like to see you in your very own television show with kitchen maids, helper, gardeners and everything.   You’re a delight!      {Martha Stewart?.... who is she?}
The sight of that turkey with all the mayonnaise makes me want to throw up.
Pssst! Why is she pronouncing galantine as galatine?
suddenly glad that the pilgrims left England
I'm sure it tastes great but it looks incredibly unappetizing
No wonder they would only live up to their 30s or 40s. Lol. Id die too if that was all to eat. Beautiful series though. Helps me study. It makes for nice background noise.
I am both amazed and completely appalled by the turkey but I love history too much to hate it
Guys I have no idea why but I love this lady.
Love her but the meat is filling isn't well cooked
Oh my goodness, that looks disgusting. WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL BOILS A TURKEY.
Looks absolutely delicious!
I love the way her style & cook . 💗💗
Why did you wrap the turkey and brown paper?
I LOVE these videos, though.
I was hoping we would see what it looks like sliced.
I LOVE YOU MRE CROCOMBE
WOW!!! Marvellous dinner 😘😘😘 This is very delicious food , English food 👌👌👌 OK !!! It's time to reveal the truth I love English Heritage very very much 😍😍😍... Yum Yummy 💯💯💯 ... Thank-you 💜💛 again and again for sharing your videos to us 💋💋💋💋💋
No disrespect but ew!
very interesting...
That looks disgusting 🤮
No, just no.  My gawd, no.  That looks utterly repulsive.
You lost me at mayonnaise
Not an appealing recipe, for sure, but it might be alright if I didn’t have to look at it
De-boned turkey with stuffing, covered in mayonnaise and served cold? No, thanks. Would rather have left over roast turkey sandwiches with mayo, but that's just me...
Anyone who finds these interesting would probably also enjoy 18th Century Cooking on the Townsends channel.
What about english bread pudding
Thanksgiving  is  headed our way again!!!! #HappyThanksgiving Mrs.Crocombe!!!!!
This looks gross. I would have roasted it and skipped the mayo.
The Mayo is a no no. Don't do it guys!!!
Send me your C.V. and I'll see where we can use you.
I've got nor relation to England at all, but this lady makes me want to keep on watching her videos. This channel is for culture and history for them, but I haven't even heard of some of these foods. I wouldn't be surprised if they gave her, her own show.
that looks like an autopsy
I do love watching her cook.
Eeeeeewwwwww who has cold meat hello we are living on planet earth here
Sounds and looks absolutely tasty and tasteful. We shan't expect the culinary yobs and the squeamish ninnies of today to appreciate such good food, at once homely and stately.
I love how she says armends instead of almonds haha
I really appreciate the effort but I really didn't like this recipe. I am no expert on the way poultry dishes were prepared in that era,     but this recipe seems a little under cooked if you consider the turkey and the sausage meat stuffed inside the turkey. I have also made many poultry dishes but this one seems appalling to me.
Oh my gosh..I think the stuffing is actually KETO! I'm doing this for Thanksgiving.
Most of the foods in the series looks bland as hell and disgusting sometimes, but I swear to god this lady got me hooked on her vids 😂
This is very much a French/Spanish/Portuguese/Italian dish...
Why didn't she cut the threads before putting mayo on the turkey though? What if someone accidentally gets a piece of thread served on the plate?
From where did they get pistachios and lemon ?
These recipes are always so interesting to see. To us modern folks the Victorian way of cooking seems strange and the foods may seem weird or even gross, but that's because we never grew up in a time or place where the Victorian way was the only way. I think if I were able to visit someone like Mrs. Crocombe, I would take a small portion of everything she made, and try to appreciate her efforts. She would have spent all day preparing a nice meal for the family and their guests, and it would be rude of me to visit and refuse to eat the food she made.
This recipe, I'm sorry sounds disgusting (but I would try it to see if my instincts could be proven to be in error). If Mrs Crocombe had her own television series I would be a dedicated viewer!
This lady really likes her ground almond
:D
I love these videos. Thank you so much for doing this. We're Americans but are members because we admire so much the work you do in keeping history alive and present for everyone! Can't wait for our next trip to the UK to visit family and see more amazing things :)
This sounds so nasty omg
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
She packed that mayo on! lol eew
They do love apples :v
I like how she says ARRRmonds lmaoo
Someone explain to me why ground almonds are in most of the recipes
Love the series but stuffed turkey only to be served cold and slabbed with mayo seems a bit unappetizing.  I'm surprised they ate that before 😵
Does anyone serve a hot Galantina? 

Here where I come from, it's served cold and optional mayo or thousand island as a dip
anyone else feel like this should be eaten warm?
Love this series. But that thing looks absolutely hideous. Period correct sometimes doesn’t look too tasty.
This ain't suitable for my dog's bowl
I've discovered this channel since a few days and I love it! It would be even better if you added medieval music instead of christmas music,for exemple,but it's just a detail. I love mrs. Crocombe
When do we get to see Lord and Lady Babybrooke
You had me until you said boil it. What a waste of skin! Roasted seems like it would make it even better.
Eeeeeeeeew
She's an amazing actress
Her acting is on pointe 👌.
I don't quite understand: Now that it's all decorated, you take it to the table...and cut right through the string and boiled skin? The mayo is ON the boiled skin...that edible?
I was all into it till the pound of mayo was added.
Yaaass queen slay the whole castle!!!
On christmas, we have visit the beach and then go back to the family house and have a leg of ham and barbeque, anc good ol' pavalova
I want Mrs Crocombe to be my friend..)
My Brother-in-law Neil,who is from England would love this,but we seldom use suet in the USA,but butter is awesome.
I adore these videos ...
I’m gagging at the thought of cold sausage 🤮
Yum yum yum-wait, mayo? . . . WELL. Just goes to show how recipes have changed over time!
I love these 😍😍😍
I dont get why people  are complaining. She is cooking it according to the Victorian Area.
Pass on the mayonnaise......But the turkey looks delicious.
The mayo 🤢I love this series , it’s just mayo grosses me out >_< happy holidays from Japan 🇯🇵 💕
Victorian cooking was weird.
geez that looked pretty okay hot but then ...echhhh no no no
🤢 the mayo ruined it
no  salt?
I would bake it instead
1:24 I'm going to add... some SEWAGE
Not enough seasons
Looked really yummy till she put mayo on it 😒
No salt??? 😯🤔
The paradox of chaud froid.
Wha....? Mayonnaise has gelatine in it?? I’ve never known that!
These get addicting 😂
I wonder how the lady who plays Mrs. Crocombe looks like in real life. Hehe.
Oh man i just love watching the series...about this one i am not sure on how its cooked, if i just rost it in the oven? And no maionese at the end? Cant wait to see more. Thanks
i’m not sure about boiling while wrapped in brown paper...
NASTY!!!!!!
Curious where would you get the cloth she uses to cook with if you wanted duplicate the recipe?
This girl is ma QUEEN!!!!!!
Okay Mrs Crocombe I was with you until you said that the turkey was going to be served cold and started slathering mayo on it
She had to ruin it by adding mayonnaise
So they use to boil eveything instead of grilling it? It's fun to watch
God, I love this woman and this series! I hope you release many more videos in this series!
YES!!!!!
Ewww.  Mayonnaise.  🤢
That mayonnaise threw me off😨😱
why do u boil it with brown paper? is it for flavor or what?
Victorian food looks the best!
Is the galantine of turkey actually good? I got really confused at the mayo and the cold turkey part. I just want to know if anyone has tried this recipe, and what it tastes like since i really cant imagine these flavours together
This is kind of disgusting but I loved the video!! Thank you so much!!
I like to do this when i can't think of dish for the holidays
Titties sitting way up 😂😂😂😂
These videos are spectacular! I do hope there are to be more in this new year, 2018?
Are the horses well?
I feel like I was morbidly curious at first. Then she boiled it. She said stock, so I was like "Ok that could be nice. Then you make a gravy out of the stock, peel back the paper and present with gravy and vegetables." Then she said it was a cold dish and was covered in...Mayonnaise. Oh my God. Please no.
different for sure
This is absolutely grotesque
I like mayonnaise but man that’s a lot lol
You know, I was on board with this recipe up until we got to the part about boiling the bird. After that I just didn't know what was happening anymore...
i can’t lie, the mayo killed it for me
I would have gone hungry!
I dont like it at all weird preparation
That's so fatty,the French way is so much better and lighter,other recipes are great but not Turkey.
But britian you didn’t colonize Turkey
Hers is bigger
Make more of these thanks
ALmonds, not aRmonds.  The only thing I dislike about these videos. Everything else is great, but oh boy.
Whenever I'm in England I see nothing but foreign rubbish fast foods and restaurants that have everything but the traditional English cuisine. Such a shame !  Certain restaurants stock certain dishes at sky high prices and they're never fully English. There's always something added from Italy, Spain, France,etc. You go to any of these countries and they pride themselves in their culinaries. Perhaps it would be a good idea if the old, traditional English cooking came back. There are 100s of excellent recipes ( I've a read a few books on them ) which can take the market by storm. Plus, when we try foreign food we can never be sure if it is authentic .
It’s bothering me she didn’t boil the stock down to a gravy
surely.... British dunno how to cook...  n imagine what wud they eat if there was no India LOL
Wtf I was just watching kpop videos. Why am I here?
Why so much mayonnaise?? Aren't those people watching their figures or something??
Oh no, love. I can't be doing with that. Roast your turkey in the oven and serve hot. It's the only way.
Yeah man this has got to be the weirdest channel on YouTube but I love it for some reason, it's so calming
It sounded nice except for the gelatined mayonnaise and suet.
eww.....But neat
it sounds good its a bit diffent
That is nasty no wonder there  die so young ,adding apples to meat can kill😂😂😂
Que tal assado no forno?
🤢
I'm just not quite sure.
An absolute delight.
I'm just curious, but how does this taste? It looks...interesting, but I'm not really sure on how it tastes.
I'd like to see her collab with Matty Matheson
🤢
slay kweneee
yuck..tooooo much mayo...a little bit pistazie..puts the whole bowl in...lol
I miss this :( pls make more videos of her
I want a turkey sandwich on white bread with lettuce tomato and onion.
The breaks screeched when you said pistachios. I guess that's where the Arabic influence comes in at during this age.
I'm not sure I'd have a taste for that. I'd be interested in how it tasted roasted though rather than boiled. Boiled meat, yuck.
i live for these videos
Oh, the mayo
I like the show but the recipes are nasty. Still fun to watch though
There's still rope on that bird
I dont even eat mayo on my sandwiches! But still a fun video to watch.
You're a cool lady
@1:05 Lemme get dat turkey 🅱️ONELESS!
Love the idea of de-boning the turkey to then fill those voids with stuffing mixed with sausage meat, but after that, Not a huge fan of boiled turkey served cold covered in mayonnaise, but to each their own.
I love you tho
😭omg
Wait I think I've heard it wrong but..... mayonnaise has gelatin? Like real gelatin or...?
wow food in the past was kinda weird but cool lol
I'm certain that not everyone ate Turkey like that in the Victorian era 😅
i’m sadden there was no salt anywhere....
This doesn't look too appetizing, but when you think about it... It's a cold dish. So cut it up put between two slices of bread, and viola! Gallatin of Turkey Sandwiches. I'd try it.
You don't peel the brown paper off? Is it edible?
I had a deboned turkey. I dry brined it for a day, then put herbs I the inside, and injected it with white wine and broth that I had made from the bones. I roasted it and it turned out perfect. I used a Nesco roaster to cook it and that kept it nice and moist, with crisp skin.
At first I thought she said "broiled" but soon realized she said "boiled", I stopped listening at that point. Yucky!
What's the purpose of the cloth?  She used it when she made roly poly pudding, too.  I've never wrapped anything in cloth to cook it.  What does it do?
Queen
I was all in until the turkey was boiled and smeared in mayo jello. lol  I might make this but put it in the smoker or oven and omit the mayo bit.
YAAAAAS
I heard that as 'Last lady eggs'...:)
😍
Victorian  food is wild
That legit looks disgusting AF
Mrs Crocombe is the new Ruth Mott.  A series please.
Mayo? I -
whoa, it looks like a dish from the 50s!!!
what is suet and allspice? hatelets is a metal skewer?
I was with you till the mayo part 😲
Not, that I dislike majo, but it just looked gross. Why not put in the ofen instead...for a crispy, delicious outside? Could even be done later, just before serving...that would make it a great dish to prepare ahead of time. 
The stuffing however, I really like the sound of. Might try a smaller batch of that with a chicken first!
Why does her helper always have a different name but is the same girl?
This was interesting and all, but...that's probably the grossest thing possible I can imagine eating at Christmas. 🤢
What a ghastly thing to do to turkey!
What is armond? Gallotine od turkey?
Now I wanna see the video where people try this thing.
WELL DONE
This is a very old dish. The Romans used to stuff all sorts of Birds and other Animals with Nuts,  Fruits, Date Palm Fruits, meet.... of course the Romans did not use Turkeys because Turkeys originate from the Americas which was unknown to the Romans
Good way to ruin a turkey.
Christmas season is approaching. ❤️❤️❤️
So this is what Emma do every Christmas
Damn 0 seasoning
Salt and pepper? 🤔
I can see that Victorians had the blandest of tastebuds.  Love mrs. crocombe though.
👍👌
No ma'am
It's odd how many meat dishes were served cold long ago... Odd compared to now, anyway.
I was with it up to the coating.
Was seasoning not invented yet lol
You had me until.....mayonnaise. I would just leave that out, otherwise sounds delicious.
What is the brown paper made of though?
For those who thinks mayonnaise was a little gross, I suggest you to drizzle oil over the turkey then add pepper and salt. You can also use thread to bind rosemary leaves on the turkey. Just an alternative if you dont like it boiled and mayonnaise it. Awesome recipe nevertheless.
Not so appetizing for me...
This is why the Empire fell.
She lost me at mayo.
so this is whatnow? Gallifreian turkey? 😅😅
Looks like a really interesting recipe, and I'd love to give it a taste. However, if I was going to make it after it was finished cooking I'd brown it in the oven and server it hot.
These videos are cool but that turkey looks bland
Why is there no seasoning??
Thank god for Asda
Grownd armonds
Honestly, I can now understand why the British are known for unappetizing food. No offence to Mrs Crocombe of course.
Boiling turkey and then covering it with mayonnaise, i think I'll stick to roasting and garlic butter.
Ayyyyyy it's my girl CROCOMBE
This does not sound edible
I seriously love these videos
This looks splendid. I feel like one might vary this process by roasting the entire bird just at the end after it's been boiled, so the skin comes golden and crispy. Perhaps brush it with seasoned oil or glaze and then hit it in a super high heat just to brown the outside and get the skin nice. But barring that, how does one get the gelatin disolved in the mayonnaise evenly? And how does one go about pickling nuts? I've never heard of such a thing. I'd certainly eat it as prepared. It looks delicious as a cold sliced dish. Thanks for showing us!
IT'S RAAAAW
I am Jewish, and I am glad to tell you the ingredents for kugel!!(it is a Jewish egg noodle dish )the ingredients are: cottage cheese, cinnamon, 6 eggs, vanilla extract, granulated sugar, wide egg noodles, salt, allspice, and orange zest. It is not sweet, but it is savory  and delicious!!!!!!
ew...
is paper food save ?
I hope you don't mind me asking If you managed to locate any of the relatives of this woman you are portraying? I happen to be a bit of a genealogist ( not as much as my aunt).
Ewww mayonnaise good tutorial tho
did she say "armonds"?
A deboned turkey stuffed inside the butter paper and another one inside the blouse. Pilfering was so easy those days....
distant gagging noises she really just disrespected that turkey like that huh?
that looks gross haha
I adore you, Mrs. Crocombe.
Yea definitely not something I would eat
I mean... don't knock it until you try it. It didn't look THAT bad to me. The people in the comments were making it sound like it looked like a dead body or something gross like that.


Well. Lol. It IS a dead body. A turkey dead body. But you get my point.
She forgot to cut the twine.
Looks greasy to me...
Is there any way to replace that amount of mayo?
Pls message me the title of the Christmas jingle. It’s so classical and beautiful! Please.
I never knew pickled walnuts were a thing. How would that work? Did they pickle the nuts with the shell or take it off? Sounds very gross....
Do you think we could get one on how to make Sloe Gin?
You stuffed a turkey with meatloaf
She really is a very talented actress
Thank you.
That looks really nasty.  Not gonna lie.
ew ew ew EWWW
I would love to try this with turkey or chicken. I eat boiled chicken anyway. My only problem would be the de-boning. Must take ages and quite a skill. Would love to see her do that.
Very interessting recipe, thanx for showing. But I left with a question After watching. If this is a Side dish, what would go with it? AS an cold dish, with bread? I'm very curious about your answer. 
Thank you in advance
How does one debone a turkey?
thank god for Thai food
I'm hungry.!
Lol mayo
Wow that looks so yumm....
wHEreS thE .pEAcE
🤢
what would gordon ramsay say on this "turkey"...
She's back!!! Yay!!!!
Wasn’t goose the bird of choice until the late 19th century when turkey took its place?
"Cold dish" ruined it for me
Can everyone stop complaining? Surprise, surprise. This wasn't made for you. It is what people freaking ate then. Get over it.
I need to see Gordon Ramsey eat her food
No thanks.😣
I didnt want to see or hear the word mayo. Wtf
Cold turkey hahahaha
Huh. This isn’t unlike a Filipino chicken relleno. The meat filling we use in the deboned chicken is somewhat different—and we stuff whole boiled eggs with the meat stuffing that goes into the chicken. Past that, this is pretty much the same thing. So what do you eat with the turkey galantine? With a chicken relleno, we usually eat it with piping hot white rice, although it also makes a good sandwich filling, too. You can get away with eating the relleno warm, but you’re supposed to eat it cold, like the turkey galantine.
This woman loves almonds but I bloody luv it
OMG 👌💕💯☑
Love this series but this looks gross
I can't lie...this looks really disgusting but all the other recipes seem delicious!! Lol
She had me until mayonnaise...I’ll pass.
Why would you ruin a perfectly good turkey you could just broil
`muricans know nothing. They be eating syntetic mayo and chicken sammiches from 7-11, but saying cold cuts with a thin layer of mayo is gross.
u have only one clothe to wear???😯😯
No colors no flavors no taste...bored food
Not trying to be offensive but I won't eat it
That looks horrible!
WHERE IS THE SALT???
Id try it
Yuck!!!
Was mayonnaise much used by the Victorian British?  And if so, what for besides this, and perhaps things like lobster salad?
why is this on my recommended
☹☹☹🙁🙁
This one was not appealing...
That is so unappetizing...
I bet it's really good hot. After boiling,  throw it in the oven to brown it up and serve hot.  Cold it seems...yucky.  I'd serve that hot.
Im on a death row....i meant diet
Ummmm .....yum ???
Everything was fine until she boiled it...
No thanks
Mayonnaise? The dish looks good with out it. Trying to imagine the taste
eatable brown paper hell yea
That's going to be a no from me.
This is definitely one horrifying victorian dish...
Give her a show pleasseee
She left the string on...
I cannot imagine why you did not show the deboning of the turkey. That is the only part of the recipe/process I think an average cook would not be able to copy. I cannot imagine how that must have gone. Even if 2 vids were needed, due to time constraints.  The entire dish was interesting but common procedures. But that deboning of a whole bird while maintaining the “wholeness” and shape?’  I’d love to have seen it !   Am I the only one who hasn’t a clue about how one would proceed to prep the bird?
Before gmo's and our soil being destroyed, before meat became a science experiment, food had taste. Am I the only person who watches documentaries?
awful awful awful awful
ARmons?!? 😜
Where is the salt??
mmmmm no :/
WHERES THE DAMN BRANDY?
I was lost with mayo. I know it's nothing more than egg whites and oil but still....ia their an alternative?
I was right with you til the mayonnaise cover....blech....
You forgot the part where you kill and pluck the Turkey. They meat doesn't just magically appear, especially when you try to emulate the Victorian way.
Was salt not available as a spice during Victorian times?
I want to see the actress transform into mrs crocombe
Turkey comes from North America, going back to the Aztecs who first domesticated them and traded them with the Spanish. My husband is British and claims only Americans eats turkey. Boy have I got some news for him.
That looks soo nasty.
I miss he so much, please let us see her again
Terrible Victorian recipe.
What exactly is Suet? Like I said before they sure ate weird in the 1800s. a turkey covered in mayo? ew
Yeah, hard pass on this dish
Soooo grosss! But such great videos!
It looks like a frosted meatloaf lol
thats bouta be the blandest turkey PFFFFF
This isn't the stuffing I was expecting. This is a meatloaf inside a turkey. LOL Also, why have I only known suet as being something that holds birdseed together to feed wild birds in your yard? Do people still cook with it? I thought it was waxy... I've never really messed with it though. That's just what it looks like.
Sorry but if you are write “Turkey” is the first uppercase letter , you are wrong because of the Turkey is a country 🇹🇷.
Cold turkey + mayo sounds like a weird combo, but it's less weird when you consider it in the context that it's gonna be cut up and made into a sandwich.
No salt?
Who else reads the comments like your speaking in an old English accent?
This dish is certainly unusual to modern tastes. I can imagine someone over 100 years ago enjoying food like this, the Victorians seemed to into decorations and interesting looking foods but because mayo is high in fat, more people are moving away from it or using it less. I'm just curious what inspired decorating food in such a way because today it seems like any decorating is only for sweets. Was it to display wealth at the time?
😘
Eww I saw feathers on the turkey!
Did victorian not use seasoning on their meats????
to the bird who died for this video: im sorry
Ground armans
Did they really just like not season their food back then
🤯🤮
I must admit, when she said mayo with gelatine in it i knew this dish wasnt for me
That really didn't look appetizing at all to me
While I dislike mayonnaise personally, the only real issue with this I have is that she didn't cut away the stitching before slathering it. You never should leave the strings when presenting finished meats
Wasn’t Marianne called Sylvia last time?
One thing I've never understood is when do you take the strings out?
The turkey looks absolutely dreadful & you couldn’t pay me to eat it but I find the host enchanting!
Did she removed the brown paper before serving?
How about roasting it?
what about the thread? Are you going to leave it as it is?
Girl it look nasty
I love watching these recipes and get a glimpse into what people would eat even though to my modern palate it doesn't seem particularly appealing. However I do wonder, was it common to not salt your dishes in this time? I've just noticed that all these intricate dishes rarely seem to require any salt. Was it served on the side so everyone could salt to taste?
The tool you took out of the pistachio nut bowl-was that what you used to chop the nuts? Chop them in the bowl? Because would probably be a lot less messy than trying to do it with a knife on a cutting board.
Don't know how I got here but I like it.
Is this a dish queen Victoria would have eaten?
Why cold?
I have a question, what is suet? I have never heard of it ✋
I like this show, but that mayo grossing me out
Where is the salt?!
You confuse me, on one hand, you look like the kind of girl I want to be friends with... and on the other hand, I feel like you'll really hurt me with a wooden spoon if I eat the leftover condensed milk from the can
As the French recoil in horror at what we were doing in England to our food...
I'd  unwrap it while still warm and let it quickly brown in a hot oven (10-15 min. should do). Then serve as a main with some roasted veg and potatoes (gratin might go well with it) + the stock would make a good gravy!
I love this series, the food always looks so good... Though there is always the exceptions... This being one of them. This looks utterly horrible, first boiling then covering it in mayo... Not only does it not sound appealing but the presentation is very unappetising.
I would imagine that the spices are ground just prior to using (to keep their potency).  What is the purpose of the brown paper and muslin?  Can the galantine be served hot?  If so, would any changes need to be made to the recipe?
Do a behind-the-scenes
discusting
No salt no chilli how is this going to taste.
Am I the only one who doesn't think this looks gross lol I think it sounds and looks tasty
English people eat strange food
I love these series. But english food is gross yo.
You know wat? This women needs her own channel.
Nah just head down and get some moeys kebabs cuz
I'm really confused about what coriander is
nasty ............sorry but no
People back then sure eat weird...
Really?
but...but why?
That looks absolutely disgusting! Yuk! What's wrong with you people???
Is there a video for the roast beef dish?
No salt?
No cucumber ??
She's hot
I adore this actress.  actress or no, she know's her way around a kitchen.
bruh why is everyone in these comments so chill with this?  ??..no???
I was with her until the nuts.  Completely allergic.  Still looks good.
Don’t think I would eat that
Hello Mrs. Crocombe!
I am Andrea Nicole Im from Philippines and I am 11 years old I love watching your videos after school.How about you Mrs. Crocombe What is your real name?Where are you from? And how old are you? I hope you will reply☺️
boiled turkey, mmmm....
No shade but it looks disgusting 🤢
Everything is wrong with this dish. why did they ever eat it cold?
And I wondered why British food has the rep it does...
British food is SO BLAND no wonder the Indian is in so demand
If you roast the bird in the oven afterwards I’m sure it be super tasty
Omg I can’t believe she’s boiling it. Horrible idea. Never boil meat. ever.
Could I just put it in the oven and not do the nasty mayonnaise and cold thing ?
What does she say @ 4:54 " and these pickled walnuts on these ...
Супер-индейка!
WTH am I doing on this video? I have to go to a pool party soon and I’m not even dressed for it.
What is sausage meat?
Ewwww wtf 😂😂😂
that was very gross...lol
GROSS!!!
Victorian food seems bland
ماش
Ewwwww
ewwwwww so much mayo!! no way!!
why brown paper?
Her stuffing looks nasty
Blech.
Omg. I'm usually entertained by her, but this is disgusting
So we gonna eat the sewn turkey with the thread? Okay.
What.. what is suet?
Christmas music?  We eat turkey on Thanksgiving here in America!
Women these days can't be bothered. Miss the days when they cared for the family.
Okay, I was unsure when she said "boil it", I was kinda' repulsed when she unwrapped it, but I assumed it was because she was preparing to roast it. But when she said served cold and slathered with gelatinous mayonnaise I gagged. What a disgusting recipe.
How to make turkey. The disgusting way.
A cold dish? Yeck!
Yuck..Weird food
I love these Victorian videos, no offence but I just can't lie...this is very disgusting and I am sure I am not the only one think like that...
The blonde girl was Sylvia in the curry video. Now it's Marianne? Huhuhu. Just saying.
It looked interesting I kind of deboned when she said she deposited the turkey because the bones add flavor to the meat but that's okay but then when she stuffed the turkey with the stuffing the stuffing was interesting not too far from today's but when she suck but she was going to boil it I kind of cringed and I said to myself Boyle I thought she was going to put in the oven I thought she was going to rub it up with lots of butter and put some stocking and bake it at now she boiled it and it took it out let it cool off and added some type of jelly mayonnaise on top and decorated with pickled walnuts I kind of I said none of it that doesn't seem like a hot dishes she said served cold so it was like more like cold cuts it didn't look appetizing but prior to her boiling it I thought maybe she'll surprise going to serve it hot and it would have been okay but when she talked about serving it cold and put mail I didn't look good then I guess this taste choice I guess I didn't look good this saying LOL.
This woman is terrific and I love different foods but I have to say; that dish looks horrible.
What a mess
Gross
Mayonnaise ewwwww no 😷
No, no, NOOOOO!  This is just wrong!  Wrapping it in paper and cloth?; boiling it in water?; smearing it with mayo??  It's no wonder British cooking had a bad reputation until recently.  Sorry, I have to vent when food is mistreated!
That turkey looked RACHET! Just saying thank god you don’t eat that today.
That's the most disgusting thing I have ever seen
Really disgusting.
That’s just gross
What is suet?
I love the way she says "armonds" for almonds.  These videos make me smile.  I've never had a galatine poultry dish but this does seem like a great alternative to a whole roaster bird.
Disgusting
I love mayonnaise but that was a mistake lol there’s no doubt however that turkey is very bland, the British are known for having bland, boring tasting food.
If I don't like mayonnaise is there something else I can use?
This is the most disgusting way of looking turkey that I have yet to see.  I have never heard of boiled turkey with raw Polk meat in the stuffing.
That sounds disgusting.
Gross
I'm sorry Mrs Crocombe, but this turkey looks perfectly disgusting. Most of the dishes I've seen you whip up look pretty scrumptious, but this one? Nooooo....
I am such a foodie!! I would love to try anything once!! I visited Williamsburg in VA and tried their Colonial food and it was delicious!! I have tried most of English dishes and love it. The ONLY thing I won’t eat is insects. I have a terrible phobia of them.
All of your recipes are gross! yuck!
How did i get here?
Ewwww
How did she know when it was done? Did it look, smell, or feel done? Did she unwrap it to check, and would she have rewrapped it if it hadn't been? She didn't use a meat thermometer that we saw. I wonder if she would have used the liquid for something.
i like a hot cripsy juicy turkey, this just sounds disgusting... a cold turkey? eww.. i rather throw up.
Has anyone made this dish? And actually knows what it tastes like?
All that mayonnaise, ewww.
A fancy gluten free turkey sandwich.  :)  I may be in the minority but I think this would be delicious!
Gross
Wow, I can see why Britain invaded India and the other countries of the spice routes. If I had food that looked this disgusting, I would want to leave and look for tastier pastures too!
Well that's an abomination.
Disgusting 🤢🤮
That looks disgusting
Eww!
what a waste of food......
This is so gross...
2:14 did she fake putting in the 🥚 eggs? ?
“armonds”
Wait! Cover it in mayonnaise!? I thought I was watching English Heritage, not Life of Boris! How can such Slavic decadence be possible outside of mother Russia!? Too cheeki for this breeki! 

Must be work of Western spies!
Eww...just eww.
Quite possibly the most unappealing recipe I have ever seen
q asco pendeja
I just found this channel and I love love love it! I just wish you would Americanize your recipes.
That looks unappetizing 😶😶😶😶😑
Turkey without salt and CORIANDER !!! Disgusting!!No no No offence but English food look great but no taste at all in it or taste bad. I have come across with salads with CORIANDER or even worse in sandwiches!!How gross is that! Particularly when it is added raw !!English people have no taste whatsoever! You should be using Parsley instead it give a nice flavour!!
stuffing that turkey, was harassment
Eww people in Victorian ate apple with everything?
Are you american? Cause I think that all letter  "r" are silence when pronounced. I can hear some American "r" pronounced.
today were are making some TURKEY now i deboned the TURKEY but u can have your butcher do it. oh yeah dont forget the TURKEY!!!!
This looks and sounds so gross. Who boils a turkey and then 
covers it with mayonnaise? 👎
"I'm a cook, not a confectioner" proceeds to decorate cake beautifully
Yeah. Step it up, Mary-Anne.
For this recipe you will need:

Marianne
"i am a cook not a confectioner." me when my mom is yelling at me when i mess up on cooking my breakfast
Dear lord if I had to wear those dresses in the summer while working in a hot kitchen with no a/c I would have used the blood of whoever messed with me that day to decorate that cake. (Love the video though)
I am a “cook” not a “confectioner”  😂😂😂 talk about 19th dry sarcasm! 😍 Crocombe.
god mary anne speed it up
Hi, I am from India, I baked the cake exactly that you elaborate. It was amazing. Everyone in my family was appreciating it. Thank you so much for the wonderful video.
When shall we be able to meet Lord and Lady Braybrooke?
I think I just realized why I love the recipes from this channel so much; it doesn't require any fancy equipment.  No high-power mixers with a dozen attachments, no milk foamers, no pasta cranks, just basic tools that would be easy (and cheap!) to obtain.
Is it just me or do a lot of these recipes have liquor?
Take a sample of the whisky to check if it’s austere or rich.
Take a large bowl and check the whisky again to see if it’s balanced
To find out if the whisky is dignified or youthful, pour one cup of whisky and drink it.
Double check with another cup.
Put the flour, sugar, brown sugar, butter and eggs in the bowl, and make sure the whisky is still okay by trying another cup.
Mix the ingredients in the bowl while adding water from time to time.
Sample the whisky to see if it’s dry or sweet. Then break 2 eggs and have some more whisky.
Cover your raisins with lemon juice and strain the almonds. Or something like that. Check the whisky.
Add a spoon of sugar, or salt, or whatever you can find. Try a cup of whisky and put the batter in a baking mold.
Grease the oven, turn the baking mold 360 degrees and check the whisky.
Set the oven at 220 degrees Celsius and the timer on 2 hours. Then throw the baking mold out the window.
Switch off the oven, check the whisky again and go to bed.
Now I want a "Lord and Lady Braybrooke taste test Victorian food" videos.
after watching the videos from this channel, I feel like a very sophisticated person  and I  suddenly want to become an elegant woman lol
The intro showing Mrs.Crocombe throwing shade at Mary Anne*
I've realized something
I'd probably eat more slowly and savor things more if I thought about how much time and work went into them, and couldn't simply go get another one in a few weeks when I shop again.
though when I cook myself, I just wolf down what I've made because the work of cooking it tired me out, and I know there's tons more left because I make massive amounts at a time since it's scarcely more work
i purposefully never skip ads from this channel as my humble way of "sponsoring" more videos from Mrs Crocombe 💕
I thought she said "come on Berry-Anne" and thought, ooh that name is a pun because she is chopping cherries xD
Is there a reason you didn't soak the cake in Brandy after? My Granny who learned to cook in a BIG house in Northumberland always made the cake a few months ahead and then brushed with brandy once a month till Christmas and then did the marzipan and icing.  Just wondering if different type of Christmas Cake.
That cake would be worth about 200 bucks in any bakery.
im procrastinating doing my homework by watching these haha!
“It’s time for the brandy” - me as soon as I wake up christmas morning
I just love the cakes from this era. 
This is the precursor to our Jamaican 🇯🇲 Christmas/fruitcake/wedding cake. We use mostly  rum and fruit wine in our cakes and soak the fruits in rum and wine for months, if we have the time lol and add a few more ingredients. 
I even use that same technique to cover my fruitcakes with marzipan. Not a fan of royal icing though, too much work and it tricky to work with. I'm a fondant girl lol
these videos make me feel like i'm actually traveling in time, her acting is amazing and these videos are very interesting !!
You just know there's a Kitchenaid mixer in the other room. lol
Did she say she “she was not a confectioner”? Me thinkith she isith. 😂😂😂😂
6 HOURS!!





i wouldn't be able to wait..
Absolutely gorgeous! New subscriber from Mexico!

Glad That I Have Came Upon This Channel Of Your Amazing Videos.
My cakes are very similar.  Only I "age" them by brushing with liquor every other day, keeping them in the basement for a month.  People who don't even like fruitcake can't have enough and want the recipe.  ;-)
God dammit Maryanne 
Maryanne what are you doing
You're tearing this family apart Maryanne
Been watching these videos for an hour so far lol
Muito encantador assistir algo assim, um cena antiga.
Eu adorei a receita! 
Tentarei fazê-la com algumas adaptações.
Do a GRWM - The Victorian Way
That girl was busy zesting those oranges and that lady had to bother her everytime to pass the ingredients to her. She couldn't get it her damn self. Sheesh.

You two ladies are gorgeous 💕 the cake looks delicious! Pure classic
I'm watching this because of Black Butler,need to know how everything works before writing a fanfic lol
I’m using one of my favourite plum cake recipes. It’s got a lot of dried cherries in it. 😂😂😂😂
Seeing the thumbnail,all I could think was how they decorated the green icing .
wish gordon ramsay sees how you overbaked the cake
its BROWN
If only history class was this interesting
big love from INDIA😋😚😚😚😚😚😚
Next I'll be showing you all how to warm the sausage of one of the stable boy's.
i know part of being a servent is being bossed around, but the fact that mrs. crocombe says 'thank you' every time mary anne does something really warms my heart and idk why LOL
Mrs Crocombe how do you keep the house warm with the weather so fine and cold outside? ❄️
I absolutely love how wee hints of a Yorkshire accent come out now and again!
Don't be to hard on Mary Anne Mrs. Crocombe, she tries her best after all! 
God Bless this channel!
"I'm not a confectioner." Meanwhile my cakes look like some sort of Mother's Day concoction crafted by a toddler. This Christmas cake was stunning. Bravo!
Lmao this is litterally so similar to the recipe i use
Her voice makes me feel happy,i can't quit listening!!! I like this woman 👍💜
It took me a while to realize it's fruit cake XD. Still a really good video!! Makes me want it to be Christmas again ^^
I was watching some jrpg gameplay when they place one your videos in the suggestion box, I accidentally click your videos and thank God! I accidentally clicked it because  I love it! More power to guys! I subscribed! 

Greetings!

From the Philippines
I came for "the Victorian way", i stayed for "the Victorian shade"
Why is this so satisfying?
But in other news, six hours? Wow in that time the people had a lot of patience to wait a damn cake
I absolutely Love this channel 🥰
I love these videos, they're so well done, relaxing and informative!
This and 18th-century cooking are the best historical cooking YouTube channels.
This is so weird but these videos oddly satisfy me😂
"I am a cook. Not a confectioner."
I love this series.
Love these videos....enjoy seeing utensils from that time period....recipe looks so delicious...her voice is very calming and relaxing.
I love this channel. So much history ❤❤
How exquisitely lovely!The grandness of being able to relive the past.
So if we do not want alcohol being used,what ingredient can we replace with it?
I just watch these cooking videos over and over again.  They always make me smile.  MORE  VICTORIAN  COOKING VIDEOS PLEASE.....and more often.
"And after all for Lord and Lady Braybrooke am a cook not a confectioner." Damn that attitude and accent.... 😍
So impatient and so bossy and that poor woman has has about 500 names
Really like they clothes,  I wonder if they were made by someone or bought in some shop 
(sorry for my English😅)
Aha!! What beautiful utensils you have lady! 💖💖
I remember seeing my mother prepare and make her christmas cake exactly in this way....minus the decorations.....more than 65 years ago.
Imagine doing this while making the Christmas turkey, the roast beef and all of the other things for the Christmas feast.
Mrs Crocombe: I'm not a confectionery 
proceeds to use complicated piping techniques for the cake
Why tf do I ship Mrs. Crocombe and Lady Brebrook? (Is that how you spell it? 😹)
These folks loved their brandy.
I came across this channel only a few days ago and I'm in love with the recipes!!!!!!! thank you for such a wonderful take on cooking xx
Never piss of a Victorian,
They will engineer your expiration in a way so proper.
6 hours  ياربي  ياحفيظ يارب 
ياالهي وقت طويل جداا😫😫😨😨
This is my type of waifu (I'm sorry)
I  was a cook in service in the late 50's[ and the rest of my life] over the years I have had the pleasure of making Christmas cakes .I rewarded friends  every year with  one of' Sallies cakes'.Since retirement the cost of making a dozen cakes proved too costly.However I still make two for my family.I use an old Irish recipe .I also make my own mince meat which is also the best.I have had the pleasure cooking and baking for hundreds of people over the decades, mostly British in the Carolinas.I love this young woman making the cake.Merry Christmas friends.
I was wanting to eat some out of the bowl lol I bet it smells fantastic while it was cooking . Loving these videos watching every day so I can catch up
I love cherries, but I love the reineer kind of cherries,they are much sweeter
Thank you so much I didn't need this but thank you.
So enjoying all those yesteryears recipes.  Kindly continue.  Newsubber.
Dear Miss Crocombe,
I am writing on behalf of my Mistress, the Dutchess of Overland, who has respectfully asked if you would accept a position in her household as her personal cook. Such a position boasts handsome accomodation and salary, as well as full authority over the kitchen and dining staff. My mistress awaits your reply at your earliest convenience. 
Sincerely,
Mrs. McGinty
Head Maid, Overland Palace
Attempting to make this today😀 hope I got my conversions right. :-)
Fantastic...

Love from India ❤️
I will sell you my entire soul for more of these videos more regularly like a maybe one every two or three weeks I’ll take anything even one a season I just need so much more
Thank you for this!! One question: What size is the cake tin, please?
Wow her acting is so good I literally paused to video and thought, "wait a minute... they didn't have HD cameras back then, did they?"
Love old-fashioned Christmas cooking!
No leveling agent I was surprised and did not give us the baking temperature
No baking powder and soda bicarbonate in this cake recipe ?
Yas. You're so into character and i like it. Subscribing  now hihi
I think I’m tearing up because of how amazing this video is. Hands down my favorite thing on YouTube. And considering Christmas is my favorite thing ever, this video was unbelievable to me. Thank you, and I love you. 
PS. Don’t ever stop making videos for this series.✨💕
I'm flabbergasted by your perfection...u have a new subscriber today...:-)
5:07 Mrs. Crocombe laying down the law.
I might just have to try to make this...but my piping may not look as nice :).
That's a nice recip....JUST HOW MANy hoURS?>?>????
It looks really good.... but also if there was a food fight I would go for that first because it looks like it would be so dense haha lol
I’m triggered,is this video really was published in 2017 it feels like the Victorian times🤨🤷🏼‍♀️😅
Yes, that's exactly how my mother makes her Christmas cakes (minus the Royal icing).  She loves her marzipan, not me <gag>  lol
Outstanding!  And sheer delight to watch this masterful  cook weave her culinary magic!  Bravo!
This channel is an Elegant one!! 👌👌 .. Am from Africa I read about Victorian Era in books... This is the most beautiful Victorian Christmas Cake I've ever seen 😍😍😍...Monarchy desserts 💚💚💚... Thank-you so much for sharing this lovely video 👍👍👍
Jeez I love Mrs. C everytime I watch one of these videos I'm reminded of my victorian baker role in  a theater play I did
I love it! <3
I love watching this series. These actors are excellent!
Beautiful cake and presentation was magnificent I really love the way it was done thank you so much I'm going to make this masterpiece this Christmas 2018 and Merry Christmas to everyone ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wait...at the end there was a whole cake with a cake slice next to it. CAKECEPTION.
What a pain to make and so many ingredients are involved.
I’m definitely trying this recipe, love the high ratio of cherries in it, though it will be very difficult to find them here. 
Love and greetings from Mexico.
Kindve like a bajan great/ black cake.. Which is extremely popular around Christmas time. Lol
Beautiful,  Outstanding,  Superb , Amazing...I love everything about it!!!
Where the cucumber at though
I would really love to have a taste of that fruity christmas cake. 😭😍
Is this edible? 












Nah, I'm just messing around.
All I could think of was

"For this recipe, you will need... one kitchen maid," and the rest of the ingredients.
I dont know what this is but it showed up recommended and I watched and love it. +sub now
Mrs.crocombe makes us time travel...i love her a lot ..
6 HOURS HOW IN THE HECK HOW DO YOU WAIT THAT LONG!?!?!?!??!
Ooff Mary-Ann gives me anxiety
"i'm not a confectioner" she says, making the most beautiful royal icing decorations and lettering i've ever seen
Every time i watch these videos i feel like i travelled back in time(: 
Now i know how it would be like if there were video cameras in the 18th century
Glad you got yourself an assistant to assist with all those desserts for Christmas 😂😂
Cake in an oven for 6 hours 😂 I was shocked.
1:53 lookin like you made me chop up all them fruits and you're only going to use a little bit.

Later on better had
i love these videos. so sooth and...english. and interesting.
but one thing drives me crazy. why is she painstakingly mixing the dough with the spoon. it is super ineffective and exhausting. unsing clean hands to knead it through is easier,faster and more thorough than using a spoon. 
unimportant thing to think about but i cannot get over it.
thanks you for making this video♡ OOO  kisses
YES!! Another Victorian way video! The only reason why I subbed 😍😍
I am ur new subscriber from Bangladesh
New subscriber here!!!  Im now addicted to this channel 😍
Love from Philippines 💕💕💕
The penmanship could use some work, by the way. A calligrapher she is not!!
"I am a cook not a confectioner" and then makes the most intricate icing decorations EVER
I could just imagine the delicious smells coming from the kitchen on Xmas day ❤️
Look So DELICIOUS😍😍
Love old fashioned coking you can’t beat it.
could you imagine doing a cake in a oven from a wood stove?  I would be concerned about keeping a temperature.   I know my Grandmother did right up and through WWII.  I don't think she got a gas stove till closer to 1950
If I would see this actor dressed and talking like she probably does outside of this video, i'd be horrified and in chock. She's so good at her role that I can't imagine her being anything else.
I just love your kitchen😍😍😍 and the way you cook and of course the back ground music 👌👌👌👍😘
Thank you from America, I wish we had your class and culture, we be laughed at if we did.
6 hours to bake a cake???? Man, we've come a long way!
Anytime, anywhere, even with raisins and currants and chalkdust.
I am very jealous of her icing skills. And her hand writing!
What type of icing that the queen liked?




















Royal Icing
Beautiful, elegant and I imagine very delicious! 🎄
Idk why I’m so captivated by watching these.
watching all these kinds of videos somehow remind me of Emma a Victorian Romance XD
when you're american and trying to convert things in your head....
These videos are all so relaxing. I just love seeing all of the food being made by hand
It's february, but after watching this I'm in a Christmas mood. And also hungry.
I can always practically smell the ingredients when she list them and adds them together.
Can we get a TV show of just Ms. Crocombe
Wonderful 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
At what temperature do you put the oven?
i love these videos a lot. also i love how at the end the have the cake and eat it too (or somehow have a slice on the plate without taking a slice from the cake)
Its interesting how in the Caribbean we altered the fruit cake recipe, mixing the chopped fruits with wine and  rum instead of Brandy and if its a pudding we leave the fruits to soak...


This was very interesting😊😁
I'm doing a Victorian England themed Christmas dinner for my am family this year.  This channel has been so helpful with picking authentic recipes.  Thankyou!
That is a piece of artwork! ❤️
Marzipan- now there's a fondant I can get behind!
Oh my God. So classic and beautiful..  The cake would be taste amazing
Beautiful job at piping the words!!
Excellent video very informative as always thank you..💕🌲💕that cake is beautiful..🎂
I can’t be the only one binging these videos, they’re just so comforting and informative and the SOUNDS of the baking! Ah! Love it
When I heard 6hrs slow  cooking. No way, but that  cake looks so amazing 😋
xD you are putting brandy in everything milady
You gals have WAY more patience than I have kitchen room.
Hurrying a cook while she's chopping is dangerous. She's more likely to cut herself. You're doing great Maryanne! 😄🔪
I didn't know I could use my plant pot as mixing bowl!
"It's time for the brandy..." Mrs. Crocombe throws back the brandy in a single shot. "Wonderful... Now... Now.. now... SPICE! Thas what we need!  And I think a little more brandy!"
5:11-5:20 the most cute expressions of the whole video :P
😋😋
This Channel is Fantastic I Love It 😀
Omfg ppl really ate this cake!? Is too much sugar in everything too sweet 😫 id love to know more victorian recepies but can't find delicious this one.
Still loved the cooker dedication _
Love these vids! Great job! No mixers or anything!
Love making subtitles 😘
I 💖 Mrs. Crocombe.
She has a 'Mary Poppins' type of appeal. Could watch her all day long! The recipes are fabulous as well!
When she said currants I thought she was talking about water currents and I was so confused
Wow six hours for cake. The cakes I usually bake are light and bake in twenty minutes, this cake is so dense
my name is marian so whenever she says "marian" (I know it's probably mary anne) i feel like she's speaking to me haha
Pardon, but is there any way I might have an audience with Lord and Lady Braybrooke? I would love to meet them. I hear they are a most agreeable couple. I would ask them about their day-to-day lives. For mine is very dull, you see. It would be an honour to look upon the lives of the aristocrats.
I think the lady playing Mrs. Crocrumbe is brilliant.
I love the big mixing bowls she uses I believe my grammie had one of them, maybe why I like them so much
I love love this video. I find it so interesting to watch videos of that era
"i'm not a confectioner"   coulda fooled me!
That cake looks amazing!
In Barbados, the way she's making it, it would be called grapefruit cake or black cake. We don't normally decorate it .
Maid1: Why is Mrs Crocombe keeps talking to herself every now and then?
Maid2: Ppl believe she is from the future
I cant imagine baking cake without kitchen aid mixer. Ur amazing!!! Love all ur videos 😘
That stuff is as hard and dry as cement. Actually, concrete has more fluid in it
"After all for Lord and Lady i am a cook not a confectioner" 🤘
Lovely! However, I would add spice to the flour (possibly also with orange peel), so it spreads easily and more evenly in the batter.
Lovely channel, I love baking. Pity the background music (?) is not a real recording of a Christmas carol. Takes from the ambience.
I want more of Mrs. Crocombe!! Her manner is so relaxing and informative too. I love her videos!!!
Well, in Victorian london, did the the poor have a way to celebrate Christmas,  with their own recipes? I would like those kinds of recipes too.
I've never tried blackcurrant, I wonder what it tastes like
They should of just used a electric whisk would of been easier 🤔🤔🤣😂🤣😂🤣
i dont know why but the Christmas music in the background is so relaxing while watching even though it's not winter anymore
these videos make me so happy for whatever reason, they’re so entertaining and calming ❤️
I'm not sure how edible this would be in today's time, I think 90% of people would screw up how to cook it since there's no exact recipe. I have to say it's amazing how things were done back in the day.
This is a fruit cake I would definitely eat. 😋
I just realized that they don't have a mixer 😅
maryanne get it together i cant believe you would do our queen, mrs crocombe, like that with the dried cherries... smh
Good work ! So interesting ! I am french and we usually make fun of british cuisine,  but this channel present so good recipies !! This cake is amazing,  the smell must be incredible ! I absolutely love those vidéos,  it's getting better and better !!
At first i thought is was chocolate cake but i'm wrong😅😅😅😅😅
Wow i love currants!
Muy elegante el video, con el estilo de la epoca victoriana, me gusto mucho!👏👏😍👍.🎄✋
i absolutely love this series. i cannot get enough of it. thank you for making it.
Mrs crocombe wonderful to see you back on YouTube Miss May I enquire as to your optician
i love this unique video 💙
The fact that back then that green dye had arsenic 😂😂😂
Mrs Crocombe "running things" in that Victorian kitchen!!
WHERE can I get a huge stoneware mixing bowl like that?!?!?
What If I die in the 6 decades baking time?
Stop picking on Mary Anne. 😔
What is the background music?
Six hours.
For a cake.
i wonder how many people actually watch these videos for the recipe. i watch it for the role playing, it's just mesmerizing hehe
at least it doesnt require himalayan spring water.
I love her. So into character. Haha
That cake is way to dry... there r so many other cakes,French r the best and were sorry England.
legend has it Mary-anne is still cutting those currants. Damn it Mary-Anne
Traditional fruit cakes, love em! Have them every year too! Got to love Christmas!
This would be much easier to do with my Kitchen Aid! Looks delicious
Ever so cute, and a very strong hand. Thank you⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️rock on!
5:12 Damnit Jim, I'm a doctor not a brick layer! 😂
After watching this video I suddenly speak english using their accent
so lovely. food history recipe. 😊💖
Traditionally the cake is meant to be soaked daily in Brandy for a couple of weeks.
I don't like these kind of cakes with dried fruit... But this video is si calming
I love her videos! They are so well produced and the actress who plays Mrs. Crocombe is just lovely! Please continue making these videos!
I really love the egg holder ..and copper molds and bowls
I loved it. I will definitely start preparing these delicious recipes this Christmas. Thanks for sharing it!
I thought the Christmas cake is a Japanese invention?
My favorite Victorian word is endeavor.  May you succeed in all your future endeavors.
does anybody know why some of those egg yolks were so pale? I don't think I've ever seen that before
These videos are so relaxing to watch
I really love this channel ♥
Coolll! I used to love this channel and then I couldn’t find these videos anymore. 😟I still love it, and I am so happy I found it! 💗💗💗💗💗
im so glad she's back! keep them coming!
New video! Perfect for the christmassy mood :)
Mrs. Crocombe, I do say, you have the best job! A lucky lady you are.
Woah the lady seems to be such a wonderful person
questions

food colouring was a thing then? green icing? hello
A christmas cake that is all white and green? For god's sake, put some red cherries on top!!!!
Yay!!! So thrilled another recipe video!! Boy that is a lot of dried fruit. 🤣 These are my favorite videos on your channel. Mrs. Crocombe needs her own cooking channel on the BBC and they need to air it here in America. Merry Christmas Mrs. Crocombe.
Im a cook not a confectioner😂
Im a cook not a confectioner😂
. . . wow, six hours?  It really puts into perspective how utterly luxurious some of these recipes are.
YOU GOT THIS MARY ANNE
I love those videos, they're really intresting: I love Victorian age so much and for me ( i'm italian) they're also really helpful for the pronuntiation, so they're perfect!😂❤  sorry for my bad English
In today's ovens 6hrs is either going to send the fire department calling or cause a hard brick you could kill and intruder with lol
Looks basically like a fruitcake. Not my favorite.
Why am I watching this in the middle of summer. Cannot get enough of this lady!
Our universal grandmother.. we love you🙌🙌
This actress needs her own BBC series!!!!
"It's got alot of dried cherries in it"  Like a convent full of retired nuns.
Yes, I subbed to this channel in the "Recommended" section while looking for a How-to videos on Twinkies.
Marvelous!
I love that that cake is Huge!
6 hours that's a long time I'm impatient 😁
I love the vibe.. 😍
It is truly a gorgeous cake! I'll make it this Christmas 🤗⛄
It feels like I'm not worthy to watch them cook ... like I'm this farm girl and miraculously found my way to a wealthy home .... I feel very odd... and obsessed at this style of filming as well 😍😍😍
YAAAAS QUEEN
6 HOURS? :OOOO (and the orange zest?)
The people she worked for are my great great great grandparents
What a talent!  You could've fooled me - one would think you are a confectioner!  Beautiful beautiful cake.  Cheers!
Thankyou T could speak british accent verry well.
My when I saw the notification, I drop all my work and reports to watch wonderful Mrs Crocombe and her assistant. Thank you for inspiration, I will make this cake definitely <3
Kinda wish I lived back then.
mmmhh ... delicious, Merry Christmas also for you lovely ladies.
I wonder what happens if we add to the recipe 30 grs of yeast and 20 grs of baking powder? and we let take 40 minutes? and we bake.
Six hours!! Daaang! I would just forget it's there. 😕
“Im a cool not a confectioner.”
decorates the cake with detailed lace and majestic writing
Me:
Was Mrs. Bridges ever heard telling Ruby "thank you"?
I wonder what can be substituted for the almond flour. And for the marzipan as well. I'm allergic to almonds. Same with pistachios and cashews.
Can u plz post English  muffin n regular traditional basic recipe for muffins ?
Very impressive recipe mam... is it ok if we don't use baking powder?
SHE'S BACK ❤
This reminds me of the wedding cake that Rilla asks Susan to make in L.M. Montgomery's book Rilla of Ingleside (the final book in the Anne series, and my favorite). I wonder if it's a similar kind? I've always wanted to try the one in the book:

Rilla went out to the kitchen, shut all the doors with a mysterious expression which alarmed Susan, and then said solemnly, "Susan can you make a wedding-cake this afternoon?"
Where is the plum?! 😂
Except that there is no yeast in the cake, it does remind me of our German Stollen. Wonderful video!
the car in the opening got the theme of old time a bit distracted
Thank you for making these videos, they're always a sheer delight to watch.

Furthermore, would a house have employed bakers as well? Or would a cook have sufficed for most needs?
*i n t e n s e  r p *
I bet Ms. Crocombe can make even the manliest men squeal in the sack.
Wow, it's gorgeous and heavy!
Best cooking shows ever 💖💞💕
Lord Braybrooke will be pleased
Happy Christmas to you, & Mr. Crocombe (Dr. Annie Grey & family) ! What is the device used to prop the mixing bowl?
me, mid august:
Who else wants a slice of that cake... my mouth is watering
This is really good! Very informative and pretty! The cake looks beautiful!
I love your show.  It is unlike the other cooking shows on YouTube.
I'd gladly help out my mom if she talks to me as kindly as this.
Brazilian here. Subscribed!
6 hours! Oh my...
That's the prettiest Christmas cake I've ever seen!
Advance Merry Christmas everyone. 🎄
the cake looks so dry...but good video <3
watching her mix together the ingredients made me happy I have a kitchen aid
When they said roughly 6 hours I was like nope. 😂😂😂😂😂😆😂💀
Would love a series on other aspects of Victorian homemaking ! Like cleaning and mending and such
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR VIDEO. FROM REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA WITH LOVE
I'm starting to suspect that they're saying stuff like "zest of orange" and "lining of the bottom" just to sound more fancy for fancy's sake.
May I ask why its called "plum" pudding if its currants and raisins? I'm curious if this is a thing in British cooking? (I'm from the US and I'm wondering if I'm just a little behind on this topic 😁)
What?! No electric stand mixer?!
A Christmas cake to crow about, Mrs. Crocombe. Well done, and Merry Christmas!
what a nightmare. and it will be so delicious!
"Time for the brandy", my favourite time!
Would be so handy to have someone else preparing the ingredients and just mix them up myself...
"I'm a cook, not a confectioner" XD;;;; ilu Mrs. Crocombe XD;;;; (Also, six hours plus different layers of marzipan drying and the decorating? They must have started chopping cherries at 4am @.@;;;)
I don't know how I found myself here, but my goodness am I happy I did, I thoroughly enjoy watching this series, please keep making more as I am now a life long fan, thankful so much.
Just like the chop suey bread my nan taught me 😗
That's an awesome cake for a cook 💕
6 HOURS!
If they worked at a tanning salon
Hag: Let's bake this maiden for hm... a couple days
Employee: That'll kill them!
Hag: Nonsense child, I bake cakes for roughly 6 hours and this is not my first time cooking a body either.
Employee: ... 
This is fascinating, and looks delicious, BUT THE CROSS CONTAMINATION IS KILLING ME
BTW, Mrs. Crocombe is my favorite!!! Please keep her videos coming~!
5:51 How can there be a cake slice beside the cake when the cake is CLEARLY untouched??? 😂😂😂😂
Bravo .... !!! I love Mrs Crocombe 💘
These videos are just so soothing :)
This help me alot at my grandmas house she wanted a cake theamed chrismas for her every day is cristmas
Merry Christmas to you, Mrs. Crocombe and your lovely Christmas Cake 🎄🎅
So easily done. I love the fact that no funny electric beater was used. I love it
Sweet memories of my childhood 😋😋
The girl who dressed up as Marie-Anne is so beautiful. 😍
This must have HELLA lot calories in it lol
when you fall through the rabbit hole at 2 Am XD
I love these videos but why do you get this actress to do such a terrible interpretation of the accent.
What a pain in the ass (wrists actually)  without an electric mixer
助手の女性が凄く可愛い💕💕
Holy crap if I ate that much dried fruit I'd be on the toilet all day.damn!
Dear Madame,
If I need to bake this cake in OTG what should be the temperature and time
My nan literally still makes Christmas cake with basically the same method and ingredients OMG
I can't see the recipe as long as Mary Anne is there😅
Mary-Anne's nails are looking good for a servant.
6 HOURS. I rather eat it raw.
These cooking vids always make me smile. I just love cooking and her voice is so soothing!
The top of the cake should be brushed with sieved apricot jam before the marzipan layer goes on otherwise it will not stick. Be warned!
I want to be her taste tester so bad...
UK : add brandy and wine to everything
She’s a cook....NOT A CONFECTIONER
I want to see her make tamales!!
No wonder why in the victorian era people died at a young age. That amount of sugar it´s just from hell.
Marry Christmas to you mam😍😄😃
I feel so fancy watching this 🔥
Getting sick of Deck The Halls...
Ive never seen such a pale egg yolk.

neat
5:15, someone please tell this dear girl Lord and Lady Braybrooke are both Vampires. They both detest garlic and are never in the light of day.
This feels peaceful. 💐
I wanna see the inside of the cake
The butter wasn’t even softened lmaooo
日本語字幕げないのがかなしいね
So happy she’s back!
Why do I feel like it'll be dry?
This cake has no leavening, mechanical or chemical. It would be soooooo dense. Hence fruitcake's reputation as a festive brick.
Please make more pastry videos!
thats what you called baking
6 hours for a cake!! No Thanks
Get it together, Mary Ann!
Magnificiant! Great., who can do this today? Not me.
Did anyone else notice that Mrs crocombe's aprons used to be tied but now they are buttoned
It's the middle of Summer, the World is burning down outside and I'm here watching Christmas Cake recipes😂
Is that green icing dyed with.... Scheele's Green?
I really do love the relaxing tone of these videos, the perfect way to unwind after a long day.  Also I love how they go the extra mile in only using tools that would be available back in the Victorian era.
In Victorian times they would not have weighed the ingredients in grams.  Pounds and ounces rule OK.
Happy Birthday Ciel, I hope you like your SWEETS Merry Christmas
It's kinda weird but they look like a painting
I thought I was only one of a few that absolutely loved her & her videos. I guess she has quite a following!
Brandy, spice and everything nice
It's 4am
"may christmas joy fill your heart today",              'while i slave away in the kitchen'...
U recipe  so good mam
This cake gave me an inspiration to cover mine with Marzipan this year! Wonderful video!
5:33 holy moly that writing is perfect
i love the way she smile ..
Love it u got my respect
作ってる場所ってどこかの宮殿なんですか？？
Yayy another update~ a Christmas theme at that, this made me so happy😄♥
Wow the cake looks so simple and elegant!
God i wanna taste it!!
Very reminiscent of Townsends' Twelfth Night Cake.
Mrs Crocombe scarring Maryanne's back before our very eyes....oh, is this recording? Oh, uh...good morning.
You should do a recipe on marzipan and royal icing
I love your videos. I learn a lot and kinda wanna hang out with you - history comes to life! Thank you :)
Great video, good job!!
I wouldn't have this kind of patience for such a sin.
Eu amei esse canal, socorro
6 hours!!!
Do you mix or best the butter and sugar till light and fully or just well combined?
It looks delicious. My favorite thing to watch when I have some free time.
Truly, we have devolved as a species. The garbage we put in our mouths these days (— well, not me).
Mrs Crocombe is back with a beautiful cake recipe 😍💕 This series always makes my day ♥️
now i’m reading many comments with british accent 😂😂
Omg.. 6 hours... cant wait that long.😁😁😁
Are those currants red or black currants or is it a type of raisin?
the way she talks,im addicted....
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 
Mary-Ann chop dem currants gurl!
Her sass is the reason I love this video
I need to bake this.
Ooh! That's pretty
This.......is.....TERI- Na I'm joking its Amazing and Fabulous going to make this on Christmas 🎅 MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!
The one time I wish I could smell what you was making. This looks beautiful.
I love these videos, but find the calm of the whole scene very unlikely. Very wealthy households would have been constantly run about with servants who were always in a hurry and always in trouble with the head of the servants.
Do I have to get store-bought or home-made indentured servants?
Lord and lady baybrook must be awful
These videos always make me feel so warm and happy, I can’t explain it, but I love it
You are a lovely cook. I enjoy your videos very much.
Wow, beautifully decorated and looks delicious.
Goodness 6 hours for a cake? Also, that's so much raw egg. LOL OMG.
I love the background music
Oh mam 😍😘😘😃😃 what a personality...like Bishop's sister persome🤗🤗🤗 love you
I’ll bet that kitchen smells heavenly while it bakes ☺️
How to bake elegantly
OMG you need a kitchen aid mixer
Merry Christmas!

From Southeast Asia 😊
How do I position the grease proof paper on my edges if my edges have been snatched
It’s really bad that I heard Laura Clery’s Christmas serenade for Steven. 😂
I wonder what a 'low' oven temperature would be .. 250 f maybe
My nanas is the exact same recipe
I pressed thumbs up before watching 😁
Wait 6 HOURS?!?? TF??
So very interesting to watch-btfl cake--but with all that handmixing I would need a nap to rest after making this cake-I can see why they had cooks cooking for them--so much hard work for a cake--looks delicious though--thx for sharing
This puts a smile on my face.
i love mrs crocombe so much
“I’ve put a band of marzipan round the outside” ...round the outside round the outside
im getting arthritis in my hand just watching this
1:27 wow some of these eggyolkss were either very malnourished or weird. My Grandparent had small farm on which they farmed for self sustainance. They had around 10 or 13 chickens. Their eggyolks were always an intense orange. That was because they made sure the chickens had everything they needed. The area in which they could roam around was bigger than my apartment which is 50 qm²/ 538 ft² with two plumtrees, a cherry tree and an apple tree in it. They always made sure to keep some of the eggshells and pulverized them thoroughly before adding it to all the different grains theyd give them as an additional source of calcium. But the chickenswere more interested in rainworms and bugs they could catch  haha. Every dish with eggs they made tasted so good. Even tough a siter of a neighbour of my father keeps some chickens too and theyre held moderately the eggs yolks cant compare to the intense orange thats ingrained in my brain from the ones I saw at my grandparents small farm.

Rest in peace Opa Willi & Oma Renate

Also your Marzipan looks like something I'd be willing to try. The usual Marzipan found inmarkets makes me fight very hard to not be impolite and spit it out.

And of course a lot of respects for writing the decoration. I've tried it several times and try to forget the miserable outcome. But I try your recipe with eggwhites next time
this gives me downtown abbey vibes
Love this channel exquisite
It's too Beautiful to eat! 😍
damn Mary Anne
That looks and sounds so good.  I'd love to try a slice.
This is so beautiful!!
Am I The Only One, Who Finds This Woman Totally Fascinating? I Could Watch Her All Day
Thanks..Thats Great♡
thought it was gonna be choc cake and i got excited
I love this channel! Thank you!!!!
Not very well planned out, I would have started with the roof down to foundation.
6hrs??probably 18th century oven.
It is feb, why am i watching this. Hehe!
Yeeeeeeessssssss Queennnnnn
Are currants raisins???
Is it just me or  She just decorated the sides then added a ribbon?
6 hrs😲😲😲😲😲.... time has really changed..
One or more of the egg yolks were very pale.  You might want your chickens to forage more.
These videos are comforting to watch 😌
Yeessssss girl we missed you 🙋🙆
The real question is: how can there be a slice of cake AND a completely whole and untouched cake on the same table?? Mrs Crocombe might be a magician x)
you haven't given the amount of each ingredients
Is she Sporty Spice from the Spice Girls ? ;-)    Amazing cake.
This is my aesthetic ♥
I always look forward to these videos <3
Dessert, lovely.. and a cake as well, yum.
Perfect  making & baking.
Did anyone make this recipe?
I want to taste the candied peel lol looks so good
Love all your recipes!!! 😍 i hope to see something else about christmas.
This one is my favorite.
Who in the hell is lord and lady braybrook, why they aint gave my girl a raise.
That sass. “I am a cook, not a confectioner” damn girl go you.
grief some of those eggs looked so sickly pale
Thanks for having captions for the Deaf
Oh please keep making videos so I can learn to make decent British food!! Mrs Crombe...you RULE!! :)
I can't imagine how good that must smell when it's being prepared.
The comments are pure gold.
I nearly had kittens when she said 6 hours in the oven!
I adore this channels and all their recipes, would looove to see one about shortbread cookies, perfect for the Holidays
In those days we had pounds and ounces
Dekorasi is burok
Betty Crocker who?
U know, marzipan is more delicious than fondant
wait. six hours? SIX HOURS for a cake?!
The butter looks much nicer than the one we have here... very yellow
I'm curious to know who the lord & lady are.
People make cake for Christmas?? I'm not Christian, so I wouldn't know...
Come on Mary-anne. Step it up. 😂😂
I'm now wondering whether I should abandon my life as a whole and just take up living as a Victorian woman.
This is exactly how I imagined it must have been in a 19th century English country house. Well done!
it's april why am i here
Thank you!  I so enjoyed that and look forward to more  from Mrs. Crocombe.
So how is this different from the traditional pudding, what makes this a cake? Legit question
I want more of her content on this channel!!!
This makes me proud to be British ❤️😑😂
life was so beautiful before the creation of plastic! i have to admit plastic is useful in some occasions but seeing all these ingredients and having it really difficult to make this same recipe in 2018 without single use waste is kind of horrifying.
This cooking show is the reason why i subscribed to this channel
I love the way she avoid touching dough just because she's Mrs Crocombe
lovely~~
I made this for my mum lol she loved it
Maryanne wears freaking NAIL POLISH
I'm torn between loving this video and thinking  eeeew fruitcake!  ;)
Dear Mrs. Croscombe
I have found great delight in listen to your instruction in the fine art of cooking. I am in a bit of a predicament however, due to religious observances me and my family do not partake in the imbibing of alcohol. Do you perhaps have a good substitute? I would welcome any aid in this matter that you could give. 

Sincerely Ms. Morgan
I hope all the food she makes doesn’t go to waste...hate to see all of her hard work go down the drain by not digging into these dishes and desserts
Beautiful!
The English just loves dried fruit and brandy.
Now Mary Ann has a face. ❤️
Grandma???is that you?
Brits say "Happy Christmas!"
Me after seeing this: subscribe
The repetitive jingle would give Lord and Lady Braybrooke indigestion.
Her video make my heart feel warm and fuzzy inside 💛. Please oh please, post more videos for this holiday season!!
Theres nothing i hate more than dried fruits and orange zest in my cake but it was fun to watch.
Victorian kitchen staff must have had the muscles of stevedores!
This would be better with Daisy and Mrs. Pattmore
I just realised Victorian cooking had a tendency for brandy within their ingredients.
yes so happy to have Mrs. Crocombe back I love this Victorian cooking series
We need more videos from Mrs. Crocombe ,Pay her some money too.
حلوووو
Panetone
“Come on MaryAnne!!”
Watched a different doc on cooking "back in the day" and found out that they had to de-seed currants .... Makes this recipe almost suicidal!
OOhhhh I bet it's delicious!!
Ive made Christmas cake so many times now that the amount of time it takes to cook doesn't bother me
There's very little cake in this cake and a lot of fruit, I approve whole-heartedly.
I live for Mrs Crocombe!!
I like like this cake is beautifule.
Does the traditional fruit cake has its roots from this cake recipe?
gran trabajo el de las kitchen maid
I love you lady it so elegant
Yes!!!! This video is life and Christmas 🎄 cheer!!! So happy you’re back and what a stunning cake you made. I adore these videos. ❤️
That. Looks. Amazing!!!!
This is an elegant Channel. I love the Victorian Things presented onto this channel. Since I am infatuated with 'All Things Victorian' as I call it, I read a lot of books centered around this era. I am Grateful for yet another beautiful Video. Is this character's name Mrs. Crocombe, though?
When she said "Sugar Please", she invented ASMR, yas queen
wow.  beautiful cake.
This is too cute. I love it. Good work ladies!
I just binge watch this series!!! I cannot help myself!!!
Merry Christmas 🎅🎄
Is that an electric socket at the lower right hand? lol oh dear where did that come from..^^
You know what people,  we need to see and hear the voice of Mary-Anne like she`s a substitute for Mrs Crocombe day-off. LOL
~ I could watch this lady and these types of videos.....all day :)
Is it just me or does Mary-Anne look like Saoirse Ronan?
A Kitchen-Aid would have been quite helpful back in the day
I love these tutorials but I am so glad we don’t live in Victorian England. Fruit cakes are absolutely vile.
I’m addicted to this show lol
leave Maryann ALONEEE
I am a cook, not a confectioner.
6 hours omg ..thank god for  technology and the modern ovens ...
ROUGHLY 6 HOURS?!
I WOULD DIE
I love her and this channel. i love the she cooks and describes. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Merry Christmas.
Why's she calling raisins currents? Odd...
Who else was screaming "give this woman an electric blender!" Hahahaha jeez... interesting..  love this series.  She should have her own show!
Awesome, think it will be my favorite cake
Why do I feel so jealous that people got to have a job like this? I'm sure it was 16 hours a day or something terrible though.
This is so, so lovely, I really enjoyed the recipe, but, even more so, I've greatly enjoyed the company and story.
My mother made this every year.. and I hated it.
Christmas episode yeeeeey! Even though life is a little rough, this video just made me fell light and relaxed thank you ! ,😘👏👏👏🎉🎂🎅🌲⛄☃🌬❄🎁🎄🎉
I thought her name was Silvia...
She makes this video ✨💕
6 hours in the oven, wtf?
Does this always pop up in the recommendation box for anyone else or is it just me?
I loooove heritage style videos
I love the Victorian Era, and Mrs Crocombe. Bit of an emotional conflict though, if only it weren’t for all the exploitation of the colonies.
Will we ever get to see the faces of Lord and Lady Braybrooke? Me and my partner love these videos and have always wandered what they look like!
Great video, but none of ya’ll notice that white hair (4:03) in the cake?? It’s on the bottom.
6 hours for bake cakes !
Imagine the delectable treats she could've made if she had a food processor or an electric mixer!
Martha Stewart is quaking!!
Lovely. ♡
very satisfying
Is Marzipan like. . . The victorian equivalent of fondant?
Delicious!
I love this channel! Advance merry Christmas everyone!
0:40 one component not described
My husband's aunt used to make one similar, but I remember her making it well in advance before icing it. Does this one also need to be made in advance or can you make it the day before (so to speak)?
That cake is THICC.
Merry Christmas!
This looks good
Merry Xmas all
what a video! cant wait for more of mrs crocombe's recipes. She should have shown how she made the icing though
It wasn't lost on me.
一体どんな味がするんだろう...すごく気になる( ♡o♡ )
Idk how I got here but I’m happy I did these videos are really cool
This is so interesting
Oh Dios mío como llegue a aquí 😍😍❤️❤️
so much calories, 650g butter + 450g sugar. 100g of sugar is the maximum sugar amount for me to make a cake
Lord and Lady Braybrook are DEAD!
One of my pet peaves is when you're supposed to soften the butter and people melt it. Usually not an issue but it can completely change the consistency of baked goods if your not careful.
My goodness that's a gorgeous cake!
My god that looks so yummy
its delicies ..... yammmmiii
بغض النظر عن الحواق اللي تسويه ، اتابعها عشان الستايل واللهجه الحلوه 🌸🌿
This is beyond delightful!
She should have her own cooking show on Netflix.
She is so Graceful...😍👑😍
That looks amazing!!!
6 hours really?
make this a tv drama for netflix
Excellent presentation.
Come on Maryann!!!! Get a choppin.
I'm making this for Christmas looks great thank you
One large slice with a cup of coffee please. ...
Get this 1mil before christmassss
luv the accent!
Yasss get Maryanne making that appearance get it girl!! Mrs. Crocombe as always you did great :)
I just realized this is just a fruit cake. 😂😂😂
This looks so dam good wtf
Mary-Anne needs to get it together damn
Mrs Crocombe, what is in your typical breakfast menu? What are Lady and Lord Braybrooke's favourite snacks or recipes for breakfast?
What is the title of the background christmas song
She didn't dredge her dried fruits in flour. All the goodies will sink in the batter and be on the bottom. I learnt this the hard way.
Ummm.... take out the fruits and it will be DELICIOUS 😋
6 hours???
OH HAPPY..HAPPY..JOY..JOY Mrs Crocombe is back!! I've missed her and it would not be Christmas without her now! Please English Heritage. Give his lady an ongoing show. Her cake looks absolutely wonderful. And totally worth a few extra jabs of insulin that i would need. I've watch this video a few dozen times now and i love it more each time. She is so relaxing and i learn a new recipe to boot. The high production values are the best, and really make the show. She is the Mary Berry and Martha Stewart of her day. Lord and Lady Braybrooke better give her a few more shillings for all the good press she brings Audley End House.
5:07 Sneak 100
I like the  (cook not confectioner...)
I don’t think the “assistant” girl is getting paid enough
It took me back to the ages when i was not even born 😂💖
I love these videos so much!!!
0:05 car got into scene
Wish you a Merry Christmas and may this festival bring abundant joy and happiness in your life!
Christmas woyld be very happy with such a lovely fine cake.
Love all your videos !!!
I love her videos. There always informative and very relaxing ☺️
She's about as English as I am related to the Royal Family lol
i noticed the english use brandy in a lot of their deserts
6hours 😂😂
I am so enjoying this wonderful film , I am truly interested in the VICTORIAN WAY OF DESSERT AND CAKES .
Excellent !!
I'd love to have a whole series on Christmas at Audley End. Not just all the recipes for the complete meal, but also how they would have decorated, entertained, and celebrated. And it would have included how the servant's hall was decorated, whether they had time to celebrate, and so on. Christmas from both sides, so to speak.
Love it!!!!
Who else is watching in April?
Are currants a type of raisin?
I love Mrs Crocombe and her British accent.
should i borrow u a mixer or something
oh my god 6 hours🐢🐢🐢
Eyebrows are beautiful
Why she called this same maid Maryanne and Sylvia in different videos?
I never thought someone will make videos this way😂😂 thought i always get curious about cooking ways in the past.
I am subscribing👍👍
The smush sound the batter makes. ASMR
Mrs crocombe how can I bake this cake in my regular modern oven
where is the mixer omg...
To much work for just a cake. Plus, it sound more like a fruit cake which I hate. I did like was the marzipan icing.
More videos pleaseee🙌🙌 oh and what should i replace the brandy with? Can i replace it with milk or just leave it without brandy? Because I don't drink
Mouth watering delicious traditional cake!!!!
Grand almonds.  😉
idk why but she reminds me of Miss Grundy from Riverdale.. e-e
She lost me at the marzipan.
I'm glad I found these videos, they're really nice.
Excellent!  I love it!
Honestly,  this would be delicious.
maybe if I start mid-October I can get this done
She is a great actress, but she isn’t a cook. Hands are clearly not used to cooking a lot. Sorry, I notice this in every video🙈 Anyway, thanks for a unique content.
맛있어 보여요!
It was great until the dried fruits came up
Very like this chanel, love from Indonesia...
I trusted you Mrs Crocombe! You said "low oven for 6 hours" My cake burned! U.u
SHE’S MY FAV
Question what does the Brandy do for the recipe?
Marzipan? You must be mad
Looks delicious!!
Just found this channel and watched 3 recipes so far, each one had brandy in it! Yum!  This seems like such a rich cake, a little sliver'll do ya! Would love to try it.
YES MAMA IS BAAACK
EXCELLENT!
Damn it, Mary-Anne
6시간!
why do i have to see this at 8pm? now i have to wait until tomorrow to make it ^^
Beautiful!  Is this cake like a "Bride's Cake"?
HAVE THE MAID HOSTAGE
Now that's a christmas cake!  I would have just eaten it without the topping
Soooooo great. I really want to try to make it. Beautiful and delicious.
Quelle merveilleuse vidéo !!
.....and now I'm starving
This would take about 12 hours to make  wow
Wooooooow I like to taste it
You had me at brandy darling.
Yum!!!!!!!
Low oven for 6 hours??!!! Sometimes please help... What would that be today?
What a joy and a privilege it would be to be served by Mrs Crocombe.
It’s like Jamaican black cake’s cousin.
Very nice video and recipe 🌼
Thanks for sharing
Where is Maggie Smith ?
My mother grew up and was married in Trinidad while it was still British. This was essentially her wedding cake...marzipan, royal icing, and all. Though her cake contained considerably more rum. I had a similar cake at my own wedding, but it wasn't the main cake. It was mainly for, and consumed by, the BWIs! But this is our traditional Christmas cake as well.
why is the music so loud
should i do my homework? or should i watch a video on how to make a victorian christmas cake?
Lovely simple recipe, but I will have to dive into the cupboard under the stairs to find my Mum's old wedding cake tins, I have nothing else deep enough.  And when I say "tin," I mean tin, so the paper will actually be saving lives in this instance. Many thanks from Toronto.
have you heard of the electric mixer???? Lol XD
Cooking is one thing...but you have to spell too! It's a good thing it's the present
I love you Ms crocombre 😍😍😍😘😘😘
I wonder why the fruits and spice weren't macerated in the brandy before being added to the batter? I was expecting that.
BEAUTIFUL!❄
Marzipan...the original fondant.
I'll bet that's delicious!!
these videos are awesome!!!!😄😁...i just cant handle the repetitious music looped in the background!! .it really detracts from these wonderful old fashioned videos...
6 hours??!?! I'd wanna eat it within 10 minutes.
Wow no mixer to make a cake
I really wish they'd play actual Victorian christmas carols or something in the background... this midi muzak is gross. I love these vids otherwise!
What a lovely era it was
Looks great but it really needs more cucumber.
I'm gonna make this for christmas.
Mrs Crocombe better be careful, Maryanne looked like she wanted to chop her fingers off
Has Marianne Dashwood joined Mrs Crocombe?
Cake and Christmas doesn't seem right. In Finland we never eat cake when it's Christmas. 😂😂
Me, on Novembre 1st:
Yummy!!!!
I say I’m gonna make this cake for Christmas this year, but will I really? Probably not. Either way I stan Mrs Crocombe
That's gonna be real sweet
I think this era is where I must have spent a previous life. Because I still use this much butter cooking today.
THE KITCHEN MAIDS CAN DO THAT. (reference from another english heritage video)
That’s nothing but fruit cake
It seems very delicious
These videos always make me happy. I can watch it again and again because i love everything in it. Please keep doing this 😊😊
My mouth is watering
It looks great, sounds good
So cool and calm under all those clothes. I noticed that the butter and sugar were not so creamed as I used to. I suppose that because I used an electric beater no such thing in those days but the cake looked so nice
The amount of fruit in this cake stresses me out
am from trinidad we call it black cake same similar ingredients but we put brownin to give colour and pour on top when its done to give moist. No icing lol make only christmas time really interesting to watch ,!
So rude English people sound. Just how I’m hearing it.
beautiful cake ...
WoW!!!!!!!!
Aww... My lady,I LOVE you!!!
I can’t wait for Christmas time! Going to try this!!!
Wtf am I watching!? 😂
Brown paper? Interesting
And no ones eaten fruitcake since
I’d never attempt her recipes but I always come back and watch these videos❄️
Wow, I really want a slice of that cake.
How do we make it in pressure cooker
Sometimes Mrs Crocombe says ahhmonds. Sometimes she says armonds.
i love ur video
menudo mazacote
Omg my name is Maryann...is Maryann a common name during the victorian era?
It's not cake batter, it's cake dough
Where can you find the currents and the candied peel?
I hope she comes out with more Christmas videos this season!...PLEASE
“I am a cook, not a confectioner.” By Victorian standards, maybe. But it sure looks better than cakes from the grocery store. In the Victorian era their desserts were waaaay more elaborate and detailed than we could ever hope to see. Victorian bakers probably look at grocery store cakes from the afterlife and weep for the pastry hellscape we’ve created for ourselves.
The Christmas Cake or Fruitcake appears with the Panettone
Marvelous!
Me encanto graciassss🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🎄🎄🎄🌸😉
no baking powder needed?
Beautiful!!
Dis lady z gem
looks nice, but i have never liked this kind of cake
people must have been very constipated back then.
Really love these videos! :) Gives me no excuse to bake since you are not using any modern tools.
Is that Sporty Spice?
If I wasn't watching this so late in the evening, I would make this cake right now, even though it's not Christmas!
This channel makes me hungry
This actually looks sooooo good
That looks sooooo dense
In the original Alice in Wonderland film from Disney, the White Rabbit mistakes Alice for his incompetent maid, also named Mary-Anne. Coincidence? I think not....
Ms crocombe sounds a bit like Miranda sings 😂
Flour before the eggs 😮
I so badly want a piece of that right now 😋
6 hours?! Wow
She didn’t say Happy Christmas
All this stirring with a wooden spoon is driving me nuts!

JUST USE YOUR HANDS, WOMAN.
1/2 pint of brandy! A Merry Christmas indeed!  😁 🎄
Shes a very sweet lady :)
I love these videos. I have two questions, 1) What is the difference between raisins and currants? 2) Is orange peel used for the candied peel?
They didn't have those powered electric machines, back then.
She did not dredge the candied fruit - badly done!
why is this so fcking relaxing to watch?!  😆
6 hours she said
Sweet Brandy come to me
So a fruitcake
Chop! Chop! Mary Anne! 🙄
I need my kitchenaid 😉
I want that cakeee
Whoa, you allowed air bubbles on the top of the cake? Lord and Lady Braybrook might think it's for the servents, not the guess.
Really satisfying
Sumptuous cake. Classy, elegant lady. Beautiful English. So pleasing to the ears unlike the american one!
WOW AMAZING
日本人がいない😏
My teeth are aching just looking at that cake. It must have been so incredibly sweet. I would not be able to eat more than a tiny piece lol.
Never got the appeal of candied peel.
When she said 6 hours I was Like "gurl bye"
MrsCrocombe, is your cherry dry or moist?
Miss bossy boots!!!
Wouldn’t they just have used their hands to cream the sugar and butter thats how my Grandma and great Grandma used to do it mind you they were of Spanish heritage. But just makes more sense
For the cake is it possible to leave our the almonds or would it change the flavor/texture?  Could you do a simple icing instead of the marzipan?
I see most of this is sugar.
I have that exact same bowl!
this looks so good
Brandy is always there in all her videos 😂
this makes me want to live in the victorian era oml
Can we please see lady braebrooke
Are the recipes victorian or only the way of preparation?
I adore this so much
OFF with the music
Oh my! I my be a little late but that cake must taste out of this world!!!
6h....
6 hours!!!!
where did that slice come from. don't make sense
bravo
What would the temp be for a "low oven"? Any bakers here?
6 hours!!! No thanks , I'll stick to brandy brownies
5:45 There's a slice, but the cake hasn't been cut! Witchcraft!!
This is very soothing
Authentic and classic English way of making Christmas cake...by aristocratic method...and in typically European atmosphere
This reminds me of Mrs. Patmore and Daisy from Downton Abbey.
Nice to watch
This was so calm and pleasing to watch. Why are victorian cooking videos more entertaining than modern cooking videos?
How and why was this series created? It's very enjoyable to watch. 😀
Love this channel
I love these videos  thank u !
I have a liking for your dessert foods a lot. I come from a completely different ethnic group but still enjoy the taste. And for a recommendation (if you did this the viewers would see me running across your lawn at the start of the video out of my eagerness to try it), I’d love a video on trifle. It looks amazing and I’ve been eager to make it with my girlfriend
All the ingredients don't look appetizing.
"royal icing"? what is the difference between normal icing and royal icing?
And now she returns home and gets the plaque.
One of those eggs looks sickly
Geez that dough was more bread then cake.
Is 350 a low temperature?
Question: is caster sugar the same as confectioner's sugar or icing sugar?
Very interesting, thank you!
I don't know why but I like watching this kind of video.
Wouldn't Victorians say "Happy Christmas" and not "Merry Christmas" as we do in the States?
What was that red thing she put on the side of the cake? English isn't my first l language and I didn't understand the word. Also, why did she put that red thing over the icing? Wouldn't it ruin it? 

Also, I understand fruit cake is a traditional Christmas dish in English speaking countries? Is it usually eaten dry or is it, as I saw in some comments, soaked in brandy it something like that? Fruit cake isn't very popular in my country so I don't know much about it, I've never when eaten it! It's always cool to know about the traditions in other parts of the world.
I want to marry Mrs. Crocombe!
This look delicious , even being Muslim I love Christmas spirit ❤️ what's brandy ?
Who use pepper on their Cake??? 😂
I NEED TO SEE LORD AND LADY BRAYBROOKE EAT THE FOOD!! Gotta see ya eat it!
Marsipan means foundont
I dont like this new girl.
Ok. This took me 6 weeks to finish
Very interesting 👏🏼
These are so fun
GOOD MORNENG
I love all the comments in here!
Give this woman her own food network channel!
Beautiful  just  beautiful!!!!
If i were the girl, i would be so awkward 😂
Quite lovely, indeed!
If you hand me a fruit cake this Christmas I'll spit in your face
That looks delicious
he's gonna get salmonela😂😂
sounds a lot like a fruit cake
a lovely video! I enjoyed it very much! What would have been used to color the icing green?
What’s her Instagram!!!!!!
Thats not a cake......that's a big muffin lolol
Anyone made this cake?  Whats the taste and texture like? Seems like a heavy cake. No baking powder?  I wonder if tweaked with baking powder what would happen?
So basically a fruit cake?
Beautiful cake!
I want to eat it sooooo bad!!!! ❤😂
I would love to see a blooper reel 😂😂😂😂
Addicted to these videos
well done
what's the fan on the outside of the mold/tin for? i usualy only put paper on the whenever i bake a cake...what is it for?
Did she just put a skirt on the cake? 

I’m sure they’d be positively aghast at the site of today’s naked cakes.
I've seen this video before.
That butter and sugar should be creamed more.
She has a different accent at the end and the beginning
What's marzipan?
Sophistication at its best
I feel like sho doesent know how to bake they always cut it
In Britain, during the Victorian time the homes of wealthy families used to be divided by the running of the Upstairs and Downstairs setting. Upstairs would be looked after by the Head Bulter to the Master or the Lady of the house. The Nanny or Matron will control the day to day running of the maids, who do all the domestic house work in the upstairs part of the house, while the Matron or Head Nanny, look after the children of the house. The downstairs part of the house, belongs to the Head Cook, who's kitchen will house the kitchen servants boys or girls, milk, poultry, coal delivery, the kitchen area is the pride of the head cook, no one upsets or interferes with the head cook because the Kitchen is her department.
Maryanne? I thought she was Sylvia
6 hours holly hell
What is a low oven in Farenheit please?
I love this! I feel I got transported back into time where there was no chaos of internet.
Without baking powder how it is done
That old woman looks so very nasty and mean. It also looks like she bosses her assistants around.
why did it turn red?
I want Mrs. Crocombe to me by nana
6 hours...
Looks delish
My boyfriend walked by as I was watching this and he asked "why doesn't she just use a mixer-----ooohhhhhhh... nevermind"
Is it just me or is the cherry colored violet???
I keep feel like I’m in Disney land when I watch these....if they get invited to Disneyland for Christmas I will be shook
Victorian cooks would have used their hands to mix the cake. Impossible to mix heavy mixture like that with a little wooden spoon.
It looked over baked to me.
1:38 that was a White jolk
Brown sugar not white and treacle, plus lots of sultanas and raisins.
This Is the most boujiest way to make a cake
Isn't that hella dry?
It’s been six hours and there’s still a lot of sun out
Very pretty
Brandy? I’ll just take that out of the list.,
Mary Anne is hot! Love her!
Your cake is very beautiful !!
Why is there paper around the outside of the pan?
love this channel a lotttttt..want to go back to olden days
She is look like a Queen
The repetitive music is monotonous.
How did they get a slice without slicing the cake?....
“Now that’s it’s really well blended together” sorry but I saw pieces of egg yolks in the mix and that butter was cold as when you were mixing it continued to be stiff
PLEASE INTERVIEW THE ACTRESS!!! WE LOVE HER!!!!
Personally I'd need a spoon with a wider handle that's a bit more sturdy. Thin handled spoons and mass amount of mixture freaks me out lol
A wooden spoon with a hole in it would make it easier to mix the ingredients ...
No offence, but the cake looks scorched. I think 6 hours in the oven is a little too much
Lol this woman is so scary love it!!! The girl wants to go and watch a Kanye video 😂😂😂😂❤️
She a great cook
When she said 6 hours 0_0
1:28 those yolks are really pale, never seen that before.
6 hours!?
Ground Ahmunds
😋
Do people over there just replace water with brandy in everything they do?😂
Oh god beef
Can I skip the brandy or substitute it with another non alcoholic liquid?
If I may ask , what is candied peel?
I thought you say happy christmas there
Good job Mary-Ann!
Can you guys do a vlog in the victorian way?
I do like this fruit cake.
So is English Christmas Cake what we in the US know as "fruitcake"? Also, am I the only American watching who loves fruitcake? I don't know why it gets so much flack here. Maybe because the ingredients are unfamiliar?
I'd love to punch that woman in her face lol
Why do i enjoy watching this hahaha
Oh so it’s basically just glorified fruit cake
No, no, no, you're supposed to boil it! ;)
It's so interesting to see how some tasks in the kitchen were done in the Victorian times
Even at the end of May, when it's horribly hot and humid inside, I still feel like it's Christmas just watching this. So nice to watch when I want to forget the summer heat. :)
Fruit cake?
Am I the only one who noticed she broke into a southern accent at the beginning??
0h yay
1 like = 1 respect for Mary-Anne
I've never seen such a pale egg yolk
Superrrrrrrrrr
Come on Mary Anne ! 😂😂
Beautiful woman
So cringe but so entertaining
I would love to see a video on how they made candied peel.
Superbe!!
I love this channel
I love this!!!
I need an invite to Lord and Lady,s home!
I find this series very soothing
And that's how some of us make cake today in India..sans the brandy
I hope she made a small one for the staff.
im sorry a little of this skit goes a long very loooong way
What does it taste when you added spices in it
I noticed after watching these videos that the lady who plays Mrs.Crocombe tries her best to speak in a British accent, but if you listen carefully you can hear her Irish/maybe Scottish accent come through in all of her videos.
is she really british? Normally, I can only understand 50% of what british people talk. But her accent is very easy to understand. (I'm not and English native)
Isn't there in Europe natural sugar and natural flour yet? White food refined with chemicals causes cancer/tumors.
wow.
sugar on top of sugar on top of sugar (cookie cake, icing sugar marzipan, icing sugar royal icing). No wonder UK has such a high obesity rate. Great video though! Just shows how much our desserts have evolved to become more airy, fluffy, and less sickening sweet with more advanced ingredients like baking powder :)
Brandy!!!!!!
Is there a book for sale w the recipes and stories? The money could go for upkeep of the house or other historical sites.
What is temperature she baked at in the oven?
The comments are a huge wave
Wonderful
Nhìn ngon quá đi <3
0:53 that is satisfaction
Very polite and I want to eat some of your baking.
Six hours?!
Good lord woman, wash your hands and mix the butter, eggs etc with your hands! Faster and more through. Mixing with that tiny little wooden spoon means that cake won't be done till New Years...and I think this is the first iteration of fruit cake.
Hungry!!!
Dats too much werk
Ms. CROCOMBE
But how does it taste?
They really love their brandy aye
Cool video but the cake ingredients...honey no
GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME, MARIANNE.
she reminds me of nanny mcphee.
The baker should have told the actress how to hold the wooden spoon.
awww this is lovely.  but but , where is baking powder how is it to bake a cake without baking powder and at what temperature it is baked and how much time ??? for Normal oven ????
It looks super dry!
I think if mixing by hand surely they would have added the eggs in one at a time? Also, didn’t they leave the fruit to marinade in the brandy for a couple of days?
Anybody tried making this cake?
Какая некрасивая тётя :((
Why do I enjoy these videos so much?
I’m a confectioner (haha) I live in US and I never had a chance to eat a real Christmas cake! I’d really love to try it!
I love how she gets Mary Anne to hand her everything even though it is right next to her
Very nice👍👍
God that must be a heavy cake. Let's not get into the nutritional value
what kind of paper is that..can I find that in U.S.
man do i feel sorry for the people back then...having to eat such dense cakes with such hard icing...
Swap the brandy for a decent dark rum (I use Woods 100), once the cakes cooked leave for about a week and then feed with more rum (brush with rum allowing to soak in) then leave another week before icing. Just my opinion :)
Eww thats more like a fruit cake
Did the cake not burn cause u put it in for 6hours
Binge watching all these cooking videos today....i could wait 6 hours for a cake although i'm not too keen on marzipan but will eat it as i'm a piggy, lol. I would imagine the arm would ache lots mixing all the ingredients together without the aid of an electric whisk, phew!
doy gracias a la vida que estoy en esta epoca y no en esa, gracias deliverys de comida :V
peasants today eat better than lords back then
She sounds American
Nice Cake.
Why do i watch this i dont even have mones to buy food
Beautiful and cozy channel! I would like to see people cook like this more. I am going to be the change I want to see in the world and cook...like a Victorian!
American viewers will recognize this as fruit cake.
8 eggs! Jesus Christ.
What would Mrs. Crocombe have used to color the icing for the lettering green? Was there food coloring available at the time, or would she have made that herself?
I would LOVE to eat that cake!
Looked like a rich Victorian cake doesn't it watched it again with no mention of how to get that rich dark colour
😍😍😍
Whats candied peel?😮
MariAnne is like, come on! give me a break.
what a lovely era
Looks like fruitcake
Lovely, but would you mind giving a conventional over time and heat, plus the amount of each ingredients THANK YOU
Nasty
Yeah
Welcome to another show of “WHY IS THIS ON MY RECOMMENDED!!!”
I would have wrote on the top of the cake give me a raise
I had a boyfriend, his mother was from Scotland and she used to bake, a cake for Christmas made with whiskey in the dough, he told me that the cake was preserved in the fridge for many months....never saw such recipe ... Hints?!
Lovely
What temperature was the cake baked at?
She added the ribbon because the design she started didn't look good
Thanks, I hate it.
Am I the only one excited for Christmas? 🎄🎄😬😬😇😇👏👏
Can I go there?? I want to cook all day with her!
Yummy 😋 the very nice very sweet of the cake
awesome
5:19 looks like there's a hair in the icing!  Have this "cook" fired and sent to the workhouse, absolutely shocking.
I'm starting to love this channel! So fascinating! And I'm definitely going to make this... if I manage to find a way to cook it in less than 6 hours 😂
やば😮
面白そうな動画だ♥♥
This video is so elegant ♥️
What a lovely cake . Happy Christmas
Man, I just love these videos
This is almost like Italian Pannetone.
What is the purpose of lining the pan with so much paper?
These are better than Martha Stewart.
I love Victorian era
Go Maryann, go!!!
So nice video, I loved
6 HOURS?!
1:35 what quality are those eggs? They look a bit pale. Hen friendly?
Could you estimate how many Celsius degrees a "low fire" might mean?
🤢
Can you adjust it for loaf pans? How much time difference would you recommend?
What is the purpose of lining the outside of the tin too?
Hey guys, I love the Mrs Crocombe videos but they are so rare so I decided to make this after someone proposed it and got hundreds of likes which shows I'm far from being her only fan. I want to get her her own series to see more of this well filmed and informative content. Can you help me?
https://www.change.org/p/english-heritage-give-mrs-crocombe-her-own-series
I want to show English Heritage that it is worth it :)
Thank you
Is it possible to eat the cake without the marzipan or the icing?  It looks delicious without them.
This lady does a great reanactment. Her cake is lovely! I must wonder though - this must be the early Victorian era as her dress is almost more colonial in style
So adorable ,  it takes me to the precious time  in chrismas moment. Can't wait anymore 🎄
have a very wonderful christmas to you Ma'am :)
yo quiero un pastel asi, se ve tan rico y lleno de sabor. muy buen canal, bendiciones desde Veracruz, México.
6 hours!?! I want to make this but I don’t know if I have the time! Respect...
I would need the assistant to clean up efter me as I make a great mess everytime I bake or cook something :D
I see this is what Lara Croft does now that she's married. Cake Raider.
she's probably the best larper I'd ever seen
Idk why i'm watching this but I ended up being satisfied lmao
I changed the dried fruits to chocolate chips . And it taste sooooooo good 😂
Ah happy maids :)
this is practically the exact same recipe my family have been passing down for christmas cakes. it feels nice to live in a country that despite having melting pot of cuisine from different cultures (not a bad thing) we still appreciate traditional recipes.
Marvellous presentation and her sublime English voice is very authentic.. perhaps it would be, not less than a dream, to be one of her Christmas guest!
Idk why but Mrs Crocombe scares me......... is that wrong?
She is so bossy lol
Awesome!
Stunning!  Thank you so much.  I didn't know you could make royal frosting out of just egg whites, lemon juice, and icing sugar.  I will have to look into how to do that for sure.  I would love to know how the Victorian's would have gotten the bright green color, as I would think that it wouldn't have been today's petroleum based food coloring!  Do tell!  I use a natural food coloring and the green is pretty muted.  So I'd love to know.
yo how did i end up here
So it's a plum cake....with lots of cherries in it?
This is my favorite of all her Victorian recipes! I’m tempted to try it next Christmas, but I feel like its going to be one expensive cake to make 😂
Good mornen
“And the brandy”
PROCEEDS TO ADD AN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF BRANDY
I'm in love with this character...Great video!.
Beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you for the recipe Mrs crocombe !!! And merry Christmas !!
Oh god what am I doing here


But oh my I am in love with her accent
Wow! awesome channel !! Very creative! And very beautiful Christmas Cake! <3
This the type of stuff you watch at 3 a.m.
The music is distracting. No more in future vid please. Let Mrs. Crocombe's natural accessibility shine through on it's own. She is over interesting.
you are amazing..
It vould be a lie to say that just butter and sugar tase bad as it is... I can imagine the finished result. I must try some day.
want a piece of cake right now yummmmmm
I'd love to work for English heritage. I've always visited the sites throughout my childhood. Maybe one day
Can you use something else besides Brandy in this recipe?
omg I just stumbled upon this.  Y'all just made my holiday season!  I love you people!
6 hours for a cake to bake.... :/
What bad taste the victorian's had. Shocked at how random the ingredients are on the main dishes
That yoke is white wot
Who would dislike this?
there was no white sugar in that time and was not even granulated but more similar to a block....mmm
She puts brandy in er thang
POWERFUL AMAZING ENGLISH HERITAGE 🎂💯😊🔥● BROWN FAMILY DAPHNE COTTON 💜
Who is lord and lady Braybrooke? I'm dying to know
ah I love this - btw I saw white yolk ish and I was wondering what type of eggs were that? ( I'm sorry ! >~<)/  )
One of my favorite series on YouTube, thank you for bringing these videos to us :)
I really really really love the cooking videos. I genuinely think that every single video is perfect. And yes, Ive watched all the cooking episodes of Ms. Crocombe. Hopefully, you’ll still continue making this type of videos. Great Job!!
I wonder was adding alcohol always an intentional preserving method or just a happy accident?
How in the world  is it I never seen this channel before 😱subscribing 😍😍😍😍
Yes, become a little tipsy on Christmas!! I love it.
Wonderful video. I love it (/◕ヮ◕)/ 💗
That's a lovely video and amazing recipe! I will definitely try to do it this Christmas since I really love things with this old style, thank you so much for sharing with all of us this kind of information <3 Merry Christmas to everybody reading this comment as well.
I'm so glad I found this channel.
Can you please make some fruit cake?
Marzipan is like Victorian fondant
forgot the flour
Round the outside!
Why tf am I watching this at 2 in the morning...
Use your hands not a wooden spoon !
Y was this in my recommended....
I want to make this but I don’t want to wait 6 hours
wrong girllll u first have to get rid of the pieces butter u have to do it with ur hands now u have bits that are uneven in the cake
More please! I cannot get enough of these recipes 😭❤
WOW!!! WOW!!!! WOW!!!!! Amazing.  Thank You. What Incredible information done well.
I love the series so much but dang Mrs. Cromombe couldn't say please or thank you once😐
Poor Mary Ann
This is why I need a time machine to go back in victorian era. I seriously adore every single bit of this video
Wow.....Who knew it so much time and effort, to make a cake, way back when ???? And it looks so good. Thank you for posting this. This really makes me appreciate modern utensils and appliances.
I grew up in Canada eating a very similar Christmas cake every year, including the marzipan but not the royal icing.
This has made my entire christmas year. <3
No kitchen aid mixer back then lol...
I love these so much :)
did you use self raising flour because I didn't see the baking powder
thats a lot of alcohol, them old people be drunk
Yay another video!
SUGAR PLUMS!
The tin goes
I’m addicted to this channel now lol I must’ve mistakenly thought I heard 6 hours somewhere in there.......6 hours........But they had icing bags and tips.......So basically that was fondant before fondant
me to me when i see who ugly i am "i can fix it with some of my decoration"
My surrogate grandma did home made fruit cakes like this every year, only with LOTS OF RUM and no marzipan. Those cakes had to go all over Canada by Canada Post, so they had to be THOROUGHLY preserved in rum soaked cheese cloth as well. During the holiday parties, guests would be given a small slice of utterly decadent, boozy cake to go with their tea and coffee. Those cakes were always a show stopper!
I just can’t stop watching these videos, though I‘m allergic to dairy and eggs whilst hating meat anyways I‘d never cook anything they‘re making 😅
What degrees would the cake bake in nowadays oven?
FIRST SHE ACTED IN BRITISH NOW SHE IS TURNING INTO SOME KIND OF IRISH AMERICAN.... Weird !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is quality content I'd like to see more ofently
Making this cake is piece of cake to me. But your style makes me keep watching and replay your videos 😄 I love your kitchen and your clothes, everything is so vintage 😍😍
I HAVE HIT THE JACKPOT OMG I WANT TO LEAVE IN THIS ERA
First time seeing one of your videos, and I really liked it!
Is she really some Victorian era person or she has just created this setup? I'm really curious.. btw, it's really informative
This is awesome! Can it be made vegan?
Wow this is classic.
I adore these videos
I just found heaven in YT! I subscribed so fast.
I really wanna fix her glasses uup ahhahahhaahahaha
6 hours. yeah -.-
♡♡♡♡♡
@5:19 the hair lol
Love watching Mrs.Crocombe in the kitchen, her voice is so soothing like a mother and she's very informative.
1:31 some of egg yolks are white.?
why does she sound more american in this video lol her accent is a lil off
Omg,who can wait for 6 hours for such a delicious cake!!!?
Screw putting brandy in the cake!!!! Give me the brandy!!!!
Why am I watching this on Halloween..
So cute
I'm so glad I'm stumbled upon this channel
That was beautiful to watch and I felt like I was transported to historical England just by her voice.
I'm convinced that you guys travel way back to the past with some HD camera equipment to film this
I'm glad to see more of Mrs. Crocombe receipes, it really takes me to other places and time
I cant believe Mrs. Crocombe is back😄
I was just thinking about making a Christmas Cake. This looks delicious.
Can you please make a video for carrot cake
IMYYYYYY LADYYYY 💕
Cut The Damn Dried Cherries Yourself.
Didn't know the dark ages has technology
These videos are so soothing for some reason.
Beautiful Recipe
6 hours?!?!
I wish I could eat it! Thank you for another fun video!
She looks like Neeta Ambani to me.
Can someone explain? I’m new
Christmas is a GERMAN holiday people
Does it have cucumbers?
More like a fruit cake.
I don't quite believe that Victorian chefs are as nice as she is when working in the kitchen
This is an extremely well-made and entertaining series!!
Это царский торт! Очень красивый и элегантный! Спасибо за рецепт!
SHE IS BACKKKKKKKKKKK.. 
I love her. 
I missed her so muchhhh <3
Her voice and her accent make me cant stop listening 😍
You know, I wonder how she had a cake AND an extra slice at the end there XD
Everything was fine until "6 hours" in oven" NO i'm not doing it
absolutely lovely video!!!!! subscribed <3 love it!
I love how she is into the character in the whole video. This transports you, it’s timeless and beautiful.
I'm so glad this series comes back
I want to see bloopers of these
oooh that looks so yummy!
Love you so much ms.Crocombe
Would have appreciate had it been cut.
So this cake takes 6 hours to bake even with a modern oven? Just asking because I'd really like to make this recipe for the holidays and if I have to bake it all day, I'm going to need an early start xD
huhuhuhu bura siyag si maam asi
Im still waiting for the lady whats her face turns into a beautiful princess and realises how beautiful she is and falls in love with some really fancy important guys..
are these real people though? do these still actually exist?? not to be rude i am just really amazed by this. or maybe they are just acting for the role??
It isnt even Halloween yet and i am still watching this.
How dense the cake will be
5:52 did anyone realized that the cake was not cut at all and there is a slice already on the plate?
wow 6 hours bake time lol
I love this channel. 😍😍😍 Cute. ❤️
Almonds...cherries...plums...currants, TOO HEALTHY. 


Mrs. Crocombe: Brandy
Me: GIVE ME A PIECE OF YOUR CAKE!
Victorian or not, I'd get out the power mixer
Lol I loved how she added the cherries like "oh let me add half of the bowl...kidding let me add all of  the cherries muahahaha!!!!"
Merry Christmas Mrs. Crocombe and MaryAnne from an American MaryAnn.
I wonder if I could crockpot this...
Mrs Crocombe, what makes a fruit candied? Like in this recipe you used candied peel which seemed to be the peel of a fruit cut into squares, but what makes it candied?
But how does it taste??
I’m American and tried to make a fruit cake once and it was an absolute fail!
No cucumber? 😥
Is she playing a character or is that actually her?
MERRY CHRISTMAS MRS CROCOMBE! I LOVE the music and really EVERYTHING about your videos! Thank you from Louisiana, state with the BEST FOOD in the USA - I remember my grandmother would begin a fruitcake the first Sunday after Thanksgiving and would keep it wrapped in cheesecloth and in a tin in a dark place- she would take it out each Sunday and "Bless it" with Bourbon or Rum...the same bottle would last for YEARS! Good Fruitcake is nothing to joke about! (Not the mess with all of the yucky candied fruit...but one with golden raisans, fruit peels, nuts, etc...) . Love, vf
Marzipan is gross.
The rich colour that came out seems like some sort of browning was used because she did not mention treacle or molasses so l am assuming it was not the cake that went in that's not nice she could said
This is how my mother cooks and it makes me think about suicide for hours at a time. You've been hit by a narcissistic Victorian age idiot. They overdo everything. Sounds unbearably 'extra'.
What am I doing here. I don’t cook. I’m not English. I have three tests Monday. I have a project to be doing. I don’t even celebrate Christmas
the creativity even back then, and that tasty cake....... darn i cant eat it, phooey!
Is this a stiff cake, or is it like American cake?
It's a fruit cake. No one likes fruit cake.
Mouthwatering cake
Two Marzipan girls go round the outside.
☺ ❤ 🎂🎁🎀🎄 🎈.  ชอบดูคลิปแบบนี้มากเลยคะ ดูแล้วรู้สึกมีความสุข^^
Not a fan of oversweet stuff, cherries and candied fruits.... But good video as always

Lol
I love cooking and learning new recipes under everything. I love trying and for sure gonna try this.Thanks for sharing 😍😎
You can't beat a home made fruit cake.  I never buy them.  I always make my own.  I am a very ordinary cook, yet even mine are far better than a shop cake!  Thank you for the video!
Oh the British accent....love it....!
Amazing as always!
The arsenic green decoration makes it look even yummier!  YOLO!
How common were pastry bags in Victorian era? Are there examples of Victorian-era tips?
Wow. This video is getting me in the Christmas spirit :D
I love these videos but most of my interest is in earlier cooking and techniques. What about cooking for a 18th century house? Thanks
Retro tasty
That..was so lovely!
More marzipan recipes. fresh bread. how they displayed the large table of food in the Victorian ages. Was there a particular way they cleaned up? Any stuffed goose? I love the show.It fills my English fixings quota. I also love her cute Victorian cook outfit!
Those scissors that were used to cut the thread were modern scissors with plastic and stainless steel. I don't think they existed during the Victorian period.
A very English video.
Pardon my Americanism but what is a "currants", is that a British term?
oooh also did you candy the peel yourself? What kind of peel is it?  I've actually candied orange and lemon peel. It's delicious.
Where is written recipe ? Marzipan n icing recipe also.thanku.
Why are all the egg yolks different colours? The really light one disturbed me.
I enjoy watching these videos so much. There us something peaceful about it and it’s fun to see recipes from the past.
I also would be interested in another decoration episode.
I know they're two different time periods, but I would sure love to see her and Townsends tag team!
It was December..... 
But it is not Christmas. 
YET
so Royal and so lovely.....my compliments to the cook!
I'll try this recipe for Christmas this year!
Ooh, cool! This is the kind of stuff I LIKE to see <3 This is so cool!
6 HOURS!!  😳. That’s a really long time to bake.  It’s like cooking brisket!
I love watching these videos.. wonderful cake
Maybe you can make croissants next time
I love these videos! I love this woman!
I dig this.
I miss seeing Mrs Crocombe!!! Please make more videos!!!
How'd it taste ? I'm curious to make it for my grandparents.
I love the new girl...
Ughh too sweet, no way to eat more than one spoonfull
Is there an alternative to the ground almonds? I can't eat them due to an allergy but this looks wonderful and I'd like to make it!  Also I believe there was an ingredient that was shown at the beginning but was not explained. It say in between the peel and the oranges at 0:48. Thank you!
I hope you do another great Christmas video this year!!!! #MerryChristmas🎄🛍🎄🛍🎄🎄🎁🎄🎁🎁🎄🎁🎄🎂🎂🎂!!!
Does the ribbon not stick to the icing on the sides?
Six hours to bake a cake? what did she bake it on 150 degrees? I can bake a cake at 350F for 15 minutes and its done. why does it take them six hours?
So happy Mrs Crocombe and her lovely recipes are back :)
This is just so gorgeous. And the egg yolks are all different sizes… Just beautiful.
Incredible concept and incredible Mrs Crocombe !
Do you and the other servants live in that place or...?
Mrs Crocrombe, if I were in England, I'd like to give you a big hug! 💕💕💕 I love all of your vdos 😀
LOOK PPL.
SHE doesnt wear any gloves and mask and whatever u want! 

dont be such a weak "hygiene maniac"

while in the process, the food itself already contains so much microorganism from the open air.
I love watching these videos! Mrs. Crocombe is very informative and clear on the instructions and always makes me smile!
CHRISTMAS VIBES IS ALREADY HERE, YET I HAVENT HAD FINAL TEST 😝😝
Fruitcake that actually looks good.
So classic , I like her ❤️
I love these videos so much, haha.
it is like a fruit cake in a way ; )
After being such a fan of this series for a while, I have such a hard time imagining this actress doing modern day things like driving a car or texting. She's so wonderful!
I want to make this. I'm going to make this.
The question is, do the servers eat cake on christmas night? Are they invited to the party?
HEY HEY HEY! BE NICE TO MARYANNE. SHE IS CHOPPING THOSE CHERRIES AS FAST AS SHE CAN!
No cucumber garnish?
No cucumbers?!
It looks like a fruit cake and yummy looking
Stop slacking Mary-Anne
Mrs Crocombe needs her own series of cooking show! Well this is it, but we want more!!!! Lovely actress to watch :)
Absolutely loving this series thank you to all involved!
After watching these videos makes me very grateful for my electric hand mixer.
Half a pint of Brandy???
I like this pud.
Love this. Thank you
marry me sweetheart
Great see back with wonderful recipe
We miss this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg please don’t stop this I love it
These are some of my favorite videos on You Tube!
This is so wonderful
Im shookt when she said bake for 6 hours
too much drama
What if I don't want to wait 6 hours, how can I bake it faster?
I like this lady
how did I get here? I'm not entirely complaining so much as questioning YouTubes algorithm?
Is that Downton Abbey
I really like watching these tutorials. When “How to film videos and upload them on YouTube Victorian Way”? Hahaha
Why the hell did I watch this?
Question: So the egg whites added to the marzipan and royal icing is raw? I thought raw eggs are not safe. Anybody?
Like can you just get your own channel?  I love you and I'd love to see more of these videos.
I'm not a confecioner hahaah I like this videos, I think they will be good for my english pronuntation, eventhougt I'm not a fan of the british accent.
Wow, you have a new video which everyone's waiting for.
* tries baking and ends up messing up the cake*
"I'm a cook not a confectioner."
Happy Christmas indeed should someone prepare us such a cake. Lovely.
When are we going to see the Lord and Lady Braybrooke?
Yay, a new kitchen video!  Also, we got to finally meet MaryAnn.  :)  Who will we meet next time from the kitchen I wonder?
in the name of all good things on earth! greetings from mexico, love the cake and will try it this christmas!
Never heard of a current before
Flawless!!
Do you deliver to Alabama?
look delish 😘
Thank you for this lovely demonstration.  I do have a question from across the pond.  How far back does the traditional British CHRISTMAS CAKE (fruitcake wrapped in marzipan and fondant) go in history?
Yayayayayayya cake
6hours? is it real?
So is this a fruitcake? Or a variation of such?
What on earth is candied peel?
Why do people even put brandy on fruit cakes anyway?
Hurry up, Mary Anne!
Hello its looks like delicious but don't you put baking powder? Thanks
“For servants, this looks just fine” that shade
I love how much effort this lady is pudding in these videos.
No cucumber pudding?? Disappointed 😂
How I make chocolate pudding:
1. buy instant packets
2. follow the instructions
3. eat it. all by myself.
There's something so satisfying about your videos <3
This is such a wholesome YouTube channel and comment section. Everyone is happy and pure. There's no fighting or conflict. Just nice homely cooking.
Oh my goodness I've never clicked on a video so insanely quickly! The aesthetics, the background storyline of Lord and Lady Braybrooke. Everything is so coherent and stunning, and Miss. Your acting is truly remarkable, and makes every video such a treat to watch really! Please please pleeeeaasseee keep up these amazing videos, I've enjoyed every one of them! xx
Servants get the crappy looking pudding. Lord Braybrook approves.
This chick is my favourite character on the channel
I would love to see her slice it and have a bite! Looks amazing!
i live for these videos. Mrs. Crocombe just looks like someone that you could talk to for hours. nice solid and stern advice on relationships, gardens and food.
I made this for my husband last week. We had it with ice cream. I used steamer though. 😁😁. Happiness is making Mrs. Crocombe recipes.
Wow it looks like fudgy brownie
She looks so proud of herself when she says 'my chocolate puddin' 😸
"always buy the best chocolate you can afford. Then you can guarantee quality"

girl, I think you overestimate what I can afford😂
That looks amazing😻😻
Just be frank, I subscribed this channel because I love to see this lovely woman cooks traditional English food. Please do more cooking videos
I love the sound of her heels hitting the floor at the start. Im not even sure why, it just gets me so excited to hear what she is going to teach next!
It's a very good way to learn English, I mean British English. I love how she speaks, sound interesting!
A treat for the servants?! His Lordship will not be pleased!
Her voice is soooo good for a fairytale book reading at night 😀😍😍😀. I found a peace whenever listened her voice.
These videos are always so great. They are well shot and a lot of fun to watch!
Never going to make them. But strangely her cooking videos are so comforting.
Thank you I love your videos I always look forward to them ..💖you are a natural thank you..💖
I am DYING to see the inside of the pudding!!!
The only series im waiting for !
I love her so much! And her cooking equipment is amazing !! Copper whisking bowl and pots <3 !
If she would have a cafe, I would visit her every week :) .
Why the bread crumbs??
It's wholesome YouTube channels like yours that make my mornings a lot better so in support of your innocent and beautiful channel I have subscribed the pleasure is all mine.
I tried this recipe and love the results 💜
Did this and it works, my new thanksgiving desert
NO CUCUMBER?!
I've been watching a channel called Townsends and they make historical dishes in the 18th century, usually American.  It's so cool to see historical American and English dishes and how similar they are many times.  Keep up the great work!  I'm curious though, did England use much of pumpkins or other squashes at all or through history?  I know pumpkins are an American crop but I wonder if they made it over to Europe before modern times.  Thanks again for you shows!  Very awesome!
Sometimes i forget that English pudding and Canadian/ American pudding is two completely different things
It's been quite a while Mrs crocombe
I'm addicted to this series
I love it! Please make some more cooking videos!
Ay mi buena señora Crocombe, lo que usted nos muestra es simplemente celestial... I would love to make this very recipe for Christmas, hopefully, it'll be as good as yours.
They should make this regularly. She’s amazing
this one of the most positive comment sections I've ever read, i love it.
YES, another one! :) ❤
Sometimes I feel like the little errand boy/girl who sneaked into the kitchen to get an apple and instead of getting angry Mrs. Crocombe took under her wing. <3
Im not even English, but im still gonna make these :3
Sooo nice you're back!!!❤😁
Who wants  cucumber pudding  
Give a like so she can make it
Mrs crocombe: for the servants 
Me:(makes for family) for the servants
Why am I binge watching this at 2am on a Tuesday night...and why am I enjoying it so much 😂😂😂
I just found this video in my recomended list and for some reason just by watching it it's giving me chills I subscribed btw😁😃
I love it. schöne Grüße aus Deutschland.
"Some prefer to use packet custard and TINNED fruit..." -Mrs Crocombe.
Its been a while Ms Cromcobe great to have you have back.
I just discovered these videos. Couldn't tell you how happy I am right now! 😊
Yayy an upload~ I really really love this series!! 😆♥
This is the video that got me interested in Mis Crocombe.
Every time she looks into the camera while giving orders, I feel like kneeling and say "Yes melady".
Honestly, that looks amazing. There's something so intriguing and satisfying about these videos...

I love these videos. Have no idea how to cook nor any interest in the food, but it's just so cool. Respect to the actress for being really good at what she does.
Your videos are full of charm keep it up :)
a thank you to Mrs. Cocrombe, for a sugary recipe I will use to 1up my mother-in-law and bask in a savory reward of hard work :)

I miss you Mrs Crocombe!

Those are some lucky servants!!🤔
I love watching these recipes, although I never attempted making any of them.

I love your videos! Please, if you can, make more! ❤️ I love your aesthetics
Your voice Is satisfying
Lord Braybrook must be balling in order to afford your services.
Before I go to bed, I would watch a vdo of this channel, especially these cooking the Victorian way series. The sounds, the music, everything, and Mrs Crocombe always make me go to sleep with smile and peaceful ❤
These videos fill me with such happiness 😍
Like everything is ok. I will be trying this recipie!

Step 2: Eat
That's a very good chocolate pudding 😍😍🎂🍰.... Really I do wish to cook it and taste it👌👌 Thank-you so much !! I do appreciate your lovely video 👍👍👍 Merry Christmas 🌲🌲🌲
I love all these episodes with the fascinating recipes. But could you do 
a video that explains how this Victorian cook would have learned her skills. Were there schools or was it on the job training? Thank you.
I love so much this videos. I'm sure we all need more. And thanks for the quality and the accurate details. Amazing job. 🙆‍♂️😀
Videos of this woman are more than enough to satisfy me...and I also love your other videos!
Love your videos!!
These videos are so amazing. I was really stressed but for some reason that calmed me down
I love english food for sure there are some things that I totally don´t like but the traditional kitchen has some elegant touch even though it´s often very simple
I just made this and it tastes delicious.Thanks for the recipe 😗
You are so elegant Mrs. Crocombe! Keep up the great work👌
I've used this recipe. It's fabulous.
I feel like the house servants in downton Abby make this on the side for extra money or something
Welp, I've just found ANOTHER cooking channel to binge watch.
These videos are very relaxing to watch ☺️
This is better than Downton Abbey!
I love how neat, old fashioned, and graceful she is.
Love when she say's :gonna whisc my eggs!
I´m an absolute fan of this. I love the decoration, the acting, the clothes, the recipes. Greeting from Spain!
You need to know mylady.... I'm half carebean, half breizh, half indian, half english...and oh my god I'm so proud of all my heritage but... the victorian and the edwardian period are... I mean the victorian period is... now I can die peacefully because I see you sharing this beautiful heritage. Thank you 🎩
