Grab your butts and get to smoking! Big thanks to North Carolina for doing their thing
Babs: rubs are very forgiving
Me: aw😊
Babs: Sugar and spice to make everything nice 
Me: stop it
I love your jokes because they’re not that funny but they’re like advanced dad-jokes, perfectly fit for your content.
2:40 "dark brown crust that forms on the outside of this butt"
Came here prepared to say Cries in Eastern North Carolinian
But I'm actually Impressed in Eastern North Carolinian
Causally gets a tattoo while meat is slow cooking, NBD 🤷😂
Why didn't you just squirt the bbq sauce with your gloves on lol
Ayy North Carolinians represent! I personally prefer the vinegar based sauce, it's so good!
You should do a Basics about Mushrooms
Tiny Whisk has been forever immortalized on Babby's arm.
Hell yeah.
Make Summer Ramen from We Bare Bears episode, "Ramen"
No ifs, ands, but PLENTY of butts
Forgetting South Carolina huh? Mustard based sauce for the win!!!
Tiny Whisk has been forever immortalized on Babby's arm.
Hell yeah.
Congrats on the sponsorship from the National Pork Board, that is so neat!
"Just a mixture of sugar and spice to make everything nice" - Babish 2019
Where did all of his flavor dust go he had a whole can
Edit now I see
loved this video! so well done.


btw, the music listed in the description is incorrect, it's actually 90's Kid by Blue Wednesday.
Next, episode 40.1, South Carolina Mustard BBQ Sauce.
Sous Vide circulator: "Oooh, I'm gonna touch the butt!"
No one:
Literally no one

Babish:So i start my own Pig Farm
The only think to explain this is😛🥰😋🤣😖😩 .
Screw sandwiches. I'm thinking Pulled Pork Tacos with crispy onion straws with that beautiful beautiful butt
I'm from Northern South Carolina I've never seen slaw without dukes mayo... Only dukes mayonnaise...
makes Eastern Carolina vinegar sauce 
never uses on meat on camera 
D: 


I'll forgive you only because you didn't bring up South Carolina's abomination mustard sauce.
That looks amazing Andrew!
I really wish a version with a slow cooker would've been shown, more people have those than sous-vide... or maybe it's a sign that I need to get one already.
No love for the mustard based BBQ sauce?! It's the best kind, especially with pork!
Just FYI, recently a bill pushed by the National Pork Board passed allowing them to self "regulate" I'd either completely avoid pork or ensure it is well done before eating.
Could you test making swedish Palt?
I cannot eat a pulled pork sandwich without a heaping of coleslaw on top. It breaks down the fat with a good crunch and the bright taste bbn of vinegar and mayo is just perfect with pork!!!
Yessss finally I've been waiting on you to do pulled pork. Awesome job Babish I love your work
As a North Carolinian this video made me incredibly proud. Great Job Babish! <3
I've been an admirer of the National Pork Board since 2003.  ...just kidding I didn't know it even existed.
Me: Im Hungry... gonna watch some babish learn too cook some goodies
AlsoMe: Doordash exists.
He should do something from the anime Food Wars
If you're gonna pull your pork, make sure your mom doesn't catch you!
Babish: It's just a mixture of sugar and spice and everything nice


Me: sings and that's how you make crystal meth!
1:14 we're gotta start talking sauce SOOO MUCH BRAD ACCENT AHHHHH love it
Let's get down to basics..


TO DEFEEAAAT THE HUNS!
Its 17th of may tomorrow hurray🎉🎉🎉
Do The Loud House, (Nickelodeon) Lincoln’s Peanut butter and sourcrout sandwich!
0:16 I always think my headphones suddenly broke whenever I hear this.
Could you do a Skyrim food special like vegetable soup or Venison Chop?
Do your own spin on the Fast Food Lasagna from Epic Meal Time next
Since Sunday is the series finale of Star vs. the forces of evil, make a special of cooking a few of these foods:
Star's Brownies
Moon's Butterfly Pie
Kitten Donuts
Tortas Ahogadas
Apology Meat
Bro! How do you manage to stay fit considering that in every video you cook fat, greasy, unhealthy stuff? 🤯
Can you make the “Sandvich” from Team Fortress 2 please
BUT PROFESSOR BABISH ACCIDENT ADDED AN EXTRA INGREDIENT TO THE MIX, CHARCOAL X
You're the man Babish, Food Network needs to get you on board.
No love for the other carolina. Why no mustard based sauce?
That’s the same slaw as Sam the Cooking Guy’s pulled pork vid from February
Next challenge. Stop by the Maine Whoopie pie festival and give us the Babish version of a whoopie pie.
The timing of this was perfect, my wife got me a new 3 in one grill/electric smoker and I was planning on doing pulled pork Saturday in it, I'll be trying this recipe.
When he said “or a friend with a smoker” and saw the traeger, I was REALLY expecting brad 😭
“Rubs are very forgiving” 




Oh yes they are babish. Yes they are
You should do an episode on just making different BBQ sauces and what they are traditionally served with
I have had the hardest time finding pork shoulders in the grocery store. That looks absolutely delicious and done to a mastered perfection. Very nice man.
when he ends the video without eating it:




no one:


me: 
Awesome vid. As a person from SC mayo less coleslaw is more common here than NC
You should make the Isotope Dog Supreme from Simpsons episode, "Hungry Hungry Homer"
Babish: 2:02 "A few glugs of your favorite hot sauce"
Me: Looks at Maddog 357
NAW IM GOOD FAM
Oh why dont you make the Jay Bridget Sandwich from Modern Family
I always confuse you between FIRST WE FEAST Sean Evans, TODAY I FOUND OUT AND BINGING WITH BABISH 😐
If I was a wrapper, I'd be called "Lil' Porky".
Can you make stan's apology cake from American dad
@5:01 TRAAAAAGER. Brad should’ve been in this video 😪
Hey babish if you already haven't making Ube cake roll it's really good

That and I got this idea from Steven Universe
One of my favourite dishes uploaded by one of my favourite YouTubes on my birthday. 
Yay!  :)
i dont think sous vide should be on basics... idk. i expected to see a simpler pressure cooker version of the recipe
Next vid: the pork picnic form regular show (idk what it's called)
You and James Hoffman should do a basics with babish: Coffee Edition! The ultimate collaboration! It would be the most refined video ever released on Youtube
You should definitely Make the soup from mario odyssy that you fight the cookatiel in
Eastern North Carolina BBQ isn't my favorite but I went to UNC and this made me nostalgic.
Make Spaghetti alla Puttanesca from jojos bizarre adventure
As a guy from Western North Carolina thank you. This is great!
Thanks for giving props to both NC BBQ styles!
Okay okay were getting close now just make THE PORK PICNIC from regular show
Bawson Butt with barbeque Sawse. 

Never change that accent.
any other pig parts i could use as the boston pork butt is not available anywhere.
coming from someone who lives in central North Carolina Id say you did a great job! your slaw needs some work though lol
Looks amazing- How does the sous vide method differ (in outcome) to using a slowcooker?
Babish: today we are going to do an indoor and out recipe...
Me: finally a recipe I can handle
Babish: we are going to suvee it
Me: Dammit...
Bbq Pulled pork is my absolute favourite food in the world
Haha, i love how you pronounce “wolshestuterrrrr” 😅😆
Why is nobody talking about the tiny whisk tattoo.
ITS AMAZING BABISH
Hey can you make Naruto/Naruto shippduen Ichiraku ramen?
What’s the music playing throughout? I checked the description and they don’t match :/
You are doing God's work.  Keep it up, my son.
Aw bab, u shoulda done a pig diagram tat for the pulled pork episode. Love this channel btw. Watch every episode.
You can also find a crockpot recipe, my family used to use it before we got a smoker
Hey Babish, can you please do ‘rig juice’ from Regular show?👍🏽
This reminds me of the pulled pork sub from the sandwich shop in the cooking fever game. 😂
The national pork board thinks they’re slick. Sam the cooking guy, now Babish? 🤔 Oh well, I ain’t complaining. Awesome recipe!
Traeger smoker?
IS BRAD LEONE THE FRIEND?
Liquid smoke and smoked paprika are incredible. Want something grilled or slow cooked in the middle of winter? It's probably better with some of both.
You're so awesome 😀😀, thanks for all your recipes 😆😆
Eastern North Carolinian here. We take our pulled pork VERY seriously. Vinegar based or nothing.
It was actually sponsored by the national pork board...I thought u were joking 🙃
Dude if you want Carolina BBQ... that coleslaw better be made with Duke’s.
I swear I looked for pulled pork in your videos yesterday. 

Delicious. Thank you 🌼
in my north carolinian household we made barbeque sauce with ketchup, brown sugar and vinegar... so i guess we were a combo of the two. strongly recommend putting these two recipes together!!
I thought East Carolina was all about cueing whole hog. I was really hoping to see Mr Andrew sling a pig into his apartment :(
BABISH DO THE CURRY RECEPY FROM BLACK BUTLER!!! PLEASE!!!! >w<
Should have brine it before cooking. I suggest apple cider base brine
Eastern sauce allllll the waaaaaay! Also, my heart broke a little bit when you put mayo in the slaw. But you do you.
You can use a stand mixer with dough hook to quickly shred pork.
Make "Friday's After Next" Ribs so good make you wanna slap yo mama
My dude the links you have for the music aren't right, I love that outro song, would love the link!!
6:18 i heard the reference to "The Call" by Ralph Vaughn Williams
As a resident of North Carolina I can confirm that this recipe is fire 🔥👌
damn that's like $30 in spices, more expensive than the meat!
Hey Babish, would you have a great slow cooker pulled pork recipe? I certainly don't have the funds for a sous vide!
Please, I beg you to make a sweetroll from Skyrim, please!
Lmfao. They way you always (try to) pronounce worcestershire sauce kills me every time. I always say "what's this here sauce!?" really quickly lol
I'm from the east coast of NC but I still prefer a somewhat spicy/sweet thicker barbecue sauce. I'm not big on the vinegar ones but they are all still so good.
Basics with Babish: "I wonder how many times I can fit the word butt in a video"
Instalike for the Powerpuff-reference....that at least I heared clearly.
Its funny, JuJu Smith Schuster on the Pittsburgh Steelers also got sponsored by Pork
“But well save that for another episode”
Andrew and Alton brown crossover please
What even is pulled pork? It sounds like a porno movie
tam from Scottish comedy Still Game
Pork butt and a 20 oz bottle of root beer and a crockpot and a bottle of sweet baby rays,! you figure it out from there!
Pouring the sauce on your hand like that gave me anxiety.
This is one guy that never seems to settle on production quality... even the subtle changes show how he always seems to be looking for every way to improve the quality of his videos. THANK YOU.
Yes! I’m so happy that you made a vid on this. Now I can learn! Thank you!
Nice. So when are you going to make some Texas style brisket?
Hey Babish I’m Allen from Pit County, NC. Let me tell you that you did the eastern NC style perfectly! Thanks for the awesome video
Ube macapuno cake!!!!!!! Do that next! 
STEVEN universe
As much as I love hearing you and everyone else absolutely struggle saying "worcestershire sauce" it's pronounced: Wusta-sheer, but hey you do you my friend
DO WHITE BARBERCUE SAUCE! I love it and barely anyone knows what it is.
I was not prepared to see Babish's actual face at the very start of this freaking video. Shook. Unnerved. I don't know how I feel to see anything above his shoulders. 😵 (I know I sound weird. I am weird).
I looove pulled pork, but haven’t had it since I went pescatarian :(
Love your channel. Could you do the pretty patty from spongebob
Hey mr. Babish, can you please teach us how you do the break the eggs with one hand? I want to fancy like you!
P.S.: Big fan,keep it up!
I literally just ate a pulled pork sandwich after my anatomy final! Awesome!
hey can you make the pink pizza from pink panther?
Ah..  the Perfect dish to prepare in the most holy month of Ramazan.
"Sugar and Spice to make everything nice". I want this to be a reference to the Powerpuff girls
I love how much you grown babish it’s so amazing watching you grow
“JUST A MIX OF SUGAR AND SPICE...








“TO MAKE EVERYTHING NiCee!”





Babish~2019
did Babby and Brad reunite to make this episode possible? I feel like I’ve seen that Traeger grill before.
Well you've done it, you've made me watch a video I never would have found thank you trading for once in my 9 years here on the platform I'm pleased w your work
I thought you were joking when you said National Pork Board...
Big fan of this episode as a north carolinian! just missing some red pepper flakes for the vinegar bbq sauce
Nice butt! I’m requesting a Cowboy Bebop episode! Thanks!
Babish can you do benson's chili from the regular show?
funded by Big Pork. and I'm okay with that. looks great.
the pork people are paying everyone, swines. Well it’s not gonna work, cow me! 😂
Nothing beats classic pulled pork from North Carolina. 👌
Yo i just got done makin this dish with ur steps Basic with Babish. Me and my famly love ur ingredients/steps thank u
For the best dry rub and bbq, look up Tom Norris’ recipe.
Wait... Is that Brad Leone's smoker you using?
shoulda stopped after the perfect moment for a butt juice joke
Man this looks delicious! But I would be hesitant to call it inexpensive. Sure the meat might be an inexpensive cut, but the methods used in this recipe are not..... But I still love your videos Babish!

sincerely, 
A broke college student.
damn, i got a free pulled pork sandwich but left it under my seat in class.
Will you ever make your own version of sweet and sour chicken?
Pfft. 

"Summer is taking it's sweet time getting here" It's already here for me friendo.
That looks awesome but I think I prefer my own recipe.
I love your show and I was just wondering if you could possibly do a Family Guy special
Memphis TN has the best BBQ the Carolinas ain’t got nothing on Memphis
Ive been noticing recently that pork companies have been advertising. Always concerning when natural items have to be advertized
You should create a Good Burger, with Ed’s sauce!
I love how he used tapatio hot sauce for the BBQ sauce lol
Yes! Finally NC gets some well deserved attention for our Pulled Pork.
The only proper BBQ sauce for pulled pork is mustard BBQ sauce...
How would you recommend doing this without a Sous vide? Brine? Coming from a grad student with not too much disposable income...
your voice is so soothing also i'm melting when you say "sweet"
No love for the South Carolinian mustard sauce :/
ahh, the superior bbq styles, the Carolinas. Tennesee would also be acceptable
“You either need a smoker or a friend with a smoker.”

...Brad. He means Brad.
Get some sous vide balls to prevent evaporation! I think they are $8-$10 on Amazon.
Sous Vide was developed by Georges Pralus and Bruno Goussault, not Kenji Lopez...
Who else wants to see Andrew tackle a whole hog Carolina style
I'm Jewish and I'm offended by the amount of vinegar and ketchup of the first 2 minutes
A good brine in a molasses based brine ahead of the smoking is good, likely not necessary for a sous vide application.
Babish: summer is taking its time getting here

Me: sitting in my livingroom pantless with all the windows open because I'm cheap and it's hot.... Yay the South!
The way, the truth and the life. I will never refer to pork as anythimg other than again!
Jeez, thanks Babish, I just ate my monitor and keyboard...
I actually became emotional at the sight of your smoked butt
This is awesome,  I'm breaking out the smoker this weekend and doing pork shoulder ribs and some chicken. I've been looking forward to smoking and drinking beer all week.
Babish you are great!
But the south asks you to pleas stop with the NYC liquid smoke convection oven BBQ. It's just wrong.
Sincerely The south.
As a Texan, I can say that summer has definitely arrived here.
Make the Every Thing Burrito from Adventure Time ( I have been binge watching the seasons for the last few days going through my child hood ).
The tattoo itself is bigger than the aforementioned "tiny" whisk. 🤔
Suggestions: Bell peppers & beef from Cowboy Bebop, Pasta with fried shrimp on top from Mtv's The Head.
this episode only came out 2 hours ago but i'm sure i've seen this whisk tattoo 100 times before...
I can’t decide which is more delicious. The beef cake, or the beef cake holding the beef cake?? 🍰
Babish: Summer is taking its sweet time getting here


His Arizona viewers, actually on fire: haha yeah
"Summer's taking it's sweet time getting here."
Tell that to us here in Arizona.
Being a native Memphian I prefer ours over Carolina style.
What would be his Chemical X for that rub?
Binging with Babish: Making cup of noodles because the wife left
Why don't I see any comments about him getting a whole damn tattoo while it cooked LMAO
I wish summertime was taking it's slow time over here, cause the temperature yesterday had reached 100 degrees outside!
Mayo isnt traditional in Cole Slaw in the the Carolinas? Im a born and raised South Carolinian and Ive ALWAYS put mayo in my slaw, both sides of my family always have.
Too bad you didn’t do a mustard based...which is what South Carolina is known for...
Man will not live by bread alone but by every Word that comes from the mouth of God Jesus said that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God 👣❤️📖📖📖
Hey Babish, love the content, but I was wondering if you could do anything with a crock pot for Basics With Babish?
This is really insane because I was just saying how I want some pulled pork o_o
As a person who lives in North Carolina, I’m so freaking tired of pulled pork. 
It sucks, I hate it.
I'm a simple man.  I see pork, I click.

And if I see pulled pork, I salivate.

This sells so well where I work and I like playing around with the recipe.  But we have a great Rationale oven with an overnight roast setting that does a perfect job.
"sugar and spice to make everything nice" put that on a T-shirt.
Felt like I was watching dr Seus at some point
nc represent!!! we love living in 
central nc where the bbq meets and everyone has different preferences
My list of foods I missed since I became a vegetarian didn't have pulled pork on it before this video. Damn you, Babish.
watching while eating a hot pocket. not even joking
“Western North Carolina” by that you mean Kansas City. We all know it
Just need some collard greens to make it a well-balanced meal!
🤤 Makes me want to grab some Dinosaur Bar-B-Que
Watching someone make nice food and as I dip pretzels in sweet and sour sauce
when you've gotten so big that a national industry lobbying group needs you to give them a sales bump
i love this series but i just CAN NOT stand the intro tune. thanks.
That was a lot more butt than I bargained for when I clicked oO
Pulled pork... uldren won’t be happy if you mess with his
Coleslaw shouldn't have vinegar in it, fight me.
Could’ve gone without seeing your arm get shaved like that lol
Loved the video, but I feel like an episode of "Basics" with Babish shouldn't exclusively use special items and special techniques, such as a sous-vide or a smoker!
Just pulled a brisket from the smoker this morning!  Not many better ways to spend a day than smoking food.
I can’t believe I never came across your channel until now! New sub 😍
You showed us that you got a whisk tattoo after we know you already had it? Not doing a good job with the continuity, Babish.
You should make Tangy Sponge Sauce and Mild Bobby Sauce
Was just looking up videos yesterday on a good way to cook pork shoulder and now it is here!!!
Love it!! Especially the cabbage.. simple and delicious!! And edible on its own!!! Yum for my tum!!  Thanks sunshine!!
this reminds me of Julien Solomita's vegan pulled pork sandwich and now that i think about it, both of you guys are very similar. I would suggest a collab?
Thanks for making me proud of our BBQ in NC!
half a cup of brown sugar? call me crazy but that looked like 2-3 cups lol
Bruno Goussault helped pioneer the vacuum sealed low temp though.
I always do pork shoulder in a slow cooker and it comes out fantastic. In fact that's pretty much the only thing I use the slow cooker for.
Tell it to me straight, Babish: was the "friend with a smoker" Brad Leone?
We need a playlist of the “ but that will be another episode”
Love the show but most people can't afford a super expensive Sous Vide machine. I mean its "basics" so it should be basic right
I almost expected the "dip your toes in the butt" ending.
Can you show us how to make spring rolls??!
You need to hit up @gugafoods and @sousvideeverything to learn a little more about bbq :) but still looks solid
you know your living the good life when the national pork board hits you up
You should do peters sandwich from family guy
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the video we've been waiting for. Biabidh playing with his butt while monetized
should not have watched this at 2am.... barbecue places are closed /:
I love these videos but I can't help but feel like it's a disservice to do a "basics" series repeatedly using tools most home cooks don't have access to.
I like to slow cook my pulled pork in a slow cooker, but I reckon next time, I'm gonna add some liquid smoke to elevate the flavours.
I’m sorry your my favorite YouTube chef but I whole heartedly disagree with the thermometer you don’t need one once the bone pulls out with no resistance it’s perfect
1:05 foreshadowing a Power Puff Girls episode?  Where you make... power puff girls...
Babish, pretty much all carolina BBQ sauce I have had has been as mustardy as it was vinegar-y.  Any recipes for a good vinegar mustard carolina style bbq sauce?
Thank you for making real Carolina barbeque. I keep trying to get some and I'll get Texas sause with Cole slaw on it and that ain't what I want.
Yup, applewood smoke incites a drool from me too 🤤
I don't have a friend with a smoker. I DO have a friend who is a smoker, though.
Could I make the rub without ginger? would it feel like it is missing something? what would I switch it with? I am allergic to ginger.
Babish gonna get sued by CN for stealing from the Powerpuff Girls.
Thank you this is the best I have ever seen this described. I may actually get one right this summer
For the love of God please make taco down taco from SNL
My eyes are stuck from rolling them but I love it lol
See kids. Even people that clearly know nothing about BBQ can still try
Someone finally shows that wonderful eastern Carolina sauce.

Is it illegal that I use a slow cooker for my pulled pork?
Make Meemaw's famous brisket from young Sheldon...
Can you make the sandwich Zack makes in the movie " 17 Again " please and thank you .
Getting a tattoo while cooking? That's really...whisky
Using sous vide for indoor smoking kinda genius really.
My mom would be upset you didn’t get all the ketchup in the bottle with the 1/2 cup water for the barbecue sauce.
I live in east NC and I didn’t even know that we had our own style of barbecue sauce
(Samuel Jackson voice) hold onto your butts!
If the rub is sugar and spice to make everything nice, is the liquid smoke Chemical X?
You’ve never made Pulled Pork on the show yet?!? Wow
can you make the unidentifiable stuff made into croquettes from kill la kill
Tiny whisk tattoo... He did it, absolute madlad
Hey Babish, was wondering if you could make a Basics video about Plating your food. Ya know, for the ladies ;).
I'm still a vegetarian. Aaaand I still watch every single one of these. Just thinking I should know how to cook this in case of an apocalypse.
Don’t even eat pork but no cap I clicked cuz of that nut worthy thumb nail
Does anybody else notice that there's a serious lack of Cincinnati style chili videos on YouTube we need some of those ;-) ;-)
So many butt jokes, but nothing on pulling your pork?
Haaaah! I looked for this video like a week ago now it’s here
How many grams are this cups he's talking about?
nothing can compete with the pork.
the pork is inevitable.
What thats in a apartment i thought that was your house. NICE DUDE
Please bro don’t disrespect your body with silly memes from the yt channel. You don’t owe people fan service, we like you.
hey you should make the food from tom bistro from parks and rec that april names
Imagine South North West East North Carolina
Can you do Sweet Hot Dogs from the Simpsons? Thank you
All those spices. Reminds me of a time I'm eating my wife's butt and it smelled like cinnamon. Very Christmas-y....
Basics with Babish but you need a I cant even spell the name of this thing machine
I live in North Carolina and I can’t make pulled pork lmao , it’s always too dry
Take a shot every time he says butt 





I DaRE YoU
Last week I tried to make this in my pressure cooker. I seasoned it pretty similarly to Babish, but my pork turned out really tough and dry. I have no idea what went wrong. The meat fell apart, but it was tough.
"summer is taking its sweet time to get here" my dude it's been like mid 80s at least every day for a month, it is definitely summer in some places lmfao
I don't trust him as much if he doesn't eat it. And why didn't he use the vinegar sauce?
For every like I’ll drink a cup of water 





Keep me hydrated
Guys its official. He's sponsored by pork.
Hey Alibaba, didn’t think your people were allowed to eat pork.
I thought he was gonna say sous vide was invented by Jake The Dog lol
CW gross stuff/animal death





This was a great notification to get immediately after dissecting a fetal pig
Absolutely no cooking method beats an actual smoked butt.
Meatstribution 😂 awesome as always. Thanks Babish
Imagine you get so good at what you do that the nation's voice for pork consumption says they wanna sponsor you
Ketchup makes the worst BBQ sauce. There aren't enough spices in the world to mask the flavor of ketchup.
This is one of the reasons why I'll never go vegan
I'm just sitting here wondering if Brad was the friend with the smoker, and if his conde nast contract prevented a cameo
We douse the pork in a bath of sauce so its totally covered in South Carolina
For a "basics" video, you need either a vacuum sealer and a sous-vide OR a smoker. Stuff that 95% or people don't have in their kitchen.

Far from basic in my honest opinion!
6:07 I don't think I've ever heard more "W"s in the word Boston.
Nothing for the moms who are making it in their instant pot! It’s fine, I’ve perfected my recipe.
when he put all that sugar in there and spices i was like ooooOoooo this is gonna be GOOD
You should make el burgergato supreme from teen titans go
Hey can you put the ingredients before the video
You should do a chicken KIEV!?
As a North Carolinian born and raised I approve this video(vinegar is where it’s at btw)
In Phoenix it’s hot. I can’t bbq anymore. Smoke is colder than the air. It all falls to the ground.
can you please make a chicken divan recipe? a simple one, thank you !
I've been eating pork loin for the past 3 weeks, very lean and nice alternative to chicken
My god you just touched the pork and it fell apart
You should do a video with blue oak bbq in new orleans 😁
Something I've played around with is brining my butt before I put it in the smoker, it's given pretty good results!
This is an epic birthday gift, thanks a ton!
Whats a good alternative to the Suveed? (I don't know how to spell that)
Could you use some of your sponsorship cash to fix that audio hiccup near the start of the Basics theme song? It’s been there since forever and I don’t know how you haven’t noticed it, yet
This was so freaky to watch, because I just had pulled pork recently and I live in NC, and you totally nailed this video
I am so thankful every episode, that you are not a vegan. Good food, good times and good videos.
You should make the protein blocks from snow piercer
What part of mayo in cole slaw isn’t Carolinas???  Signed, A Carolinian
You should make abscrantin hotdog from scranton in the office
The black gloves give me Silence of the Lambs vibes 😱 Love the ease of the barbecue sauce recipes, I often find those to be really detailed and too fussy. Those seem accessible even to me!
Hi Andrew, can I pressure cook the pork butt first and then finish it in the oven?
OMG, I literally died when he just pulled apart all that gorgeous, barbecued meat with his hands! 
I DID DIE, like for real, when the video just straight cut into the part where Andrew was getting his arm shaved for the new tattoo....
So I do a liquid smoke/root beer bbq pulled pork in a slow cooker that has completely spoiled me on pulled pork going forward, for what it's worth.
I got a smoker and while it's not the same, no one will complain about indoor bbq if it is done right. And if you don't have a sous-vide setup, a tight wrap of parchement paper in the oven works fine. The butt cooks itself, it just needs heat and love.
For some reason I never make enough run either. It always seems like soo much then it somehow disappears
Love this episode, I’m super impressed by the accuracy. I add a few more things to my pepper vinegar sauce, and also put mayo in my slaw, but everyone here does it differently. Cheers!
I use an Instant pot for pulled pork. its amazing but now i want to do it with science hahaha
As a person from North carolina I'm so happy someone know the difference between west and east bbq sauce
Do a video with guga and sous vide everything!
eating while watching these videos is the only way to keep my stomach from growling
Please, can you do Polish pierogi??
1:05 I can't wait for your mix tape to come out ;^)
Leave a like if you’re from North Carolina!!!
That's a half a cup of brown sugar the same way I get half a cup of ice cream 😂
He's just loving being able to say butt in a video
damn it, now I need to find some pulled pork for lunch
When you getting a cling wrap press and seal sponsorship? You use those things like they are going out of style.
My mom calls you Babish







BOB-EE-SHH
Sorry, but a pellet grill isn't a smoker. Might as well have kept it in the oven.
As a North Carolinian you did it pretty spot on but it’s all the about the taste so for me to judge I would have to taste it
Just here to say that there’s a reason the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest is held in Memphis
Can someone do a supercut of all the times Babish has said Worcestershire sauce??
MARYLAND STYLE - BBQ sauce and horseradish
2:22 ....and uh.. what do you do after, Babish lmao. Did you lick it, wash your hand, wipe it on the pork? I’m actually curious
Babish instructing you on how to play with butts. ;)
Why am I watching this,  I can't even eat pork lol 😂
The Way, The Truth, and The Life
Preach brother!
how about the actual 'basic' way, in the oven?
Making this this weekend. BBQ at my place!
You had me at "porcine power."
Are you interested in making martabak manis/terang bulan? It is a very heart attack inviting dessert from Indonesia.
But what about South Carolina yellow barbecue?!?! 😩
At first I thought you said this was sponsored by the National Pork Lord... serious Animal Farm vibes. Not hating it.
Yo national pork board missed the opportunity to call their brand national poard
I think that you should make the landslide from the animated movie the iron giant
IM BEGGING U PLEASE MAKE THE SHEPARD’S PIE FROM KILLING EVE
owning a smoker is like owning a truck , everyone wants to borrow it as soon as they find out you have 3.
Should have 40 Mill Subs and some acres your vids are great!
Moving in to a place with wood countertops. Have any tips for maintenance? I've never owned them before.
Currently eating BBQ pulled pork pot noodle while watching this, basically the same thing
I say this every video but I love the fact that he can’t say whostashire
I actually perfer to use my instant pot for indoor pulled pork, but I usually use boneless. Juciest, most tender pulled pork I've ever made.
Please also include South Carolina mustard-based sauce. And slaw or pickles are just as important for us as the sauce since it adds to the flavor. We have a white slaw, vinegar slaw, and a red saw (from near Charlotte, NC). Highly recommend all of them for mix and match pairings with different types of regional sauces.
is nobody in this cs gonna acknowlege the butt jokes??
I seriously thought this was a collab with How to Basic.
Pigs have 4 shoulders. 2 of them  happen to also be butts.
See into on summer taking its time. See it's 91F outside.
Mince up some pickled carrots in that slaw yo
Can you make food from real life it’s my favorite show
Babish
-summer is taking its sweet time to get here 

-Texas 
Am I a joke to you
Tomato BBQ sauce without molasses? HERETIC!
this episode is the reason i now have a cooking playlist lol
make Mississippi queen from regular show
Instead of sugars, I use m'lady Butterworth for a maple flavor, it also seems to help break it down.
Andrew touched the butt! (Finding Nemo)
For the record, slaw in eastern NC does use mayo. it's those crazies in the west that only use vinegar.
Can you show how to do lamb chops? I'm a muslim and we can't eat pork, but I love lamb!
You have to try to make a greek souvlaki
Anyone else hate sauce on meat? I love meat but when you put BBQ sauce on it it's literally all I can taste.
I’ve seen ur face before but it still surprises me every time
“If you don’t have the time, just leave it in the smoker for 6-12 hours”
I wonder if, after all those mix of spices and liquids, one can really taste the pork at all. Also, would it destroy the flavor profile (if there is one) if I don't use brown AND white sugar or paprika AND smoked paprika???
Another option is an instant pot. You don’t get a smoke ring, but you get great flavor and texture.
Bbq tip I learned from the pros, use Kosher salt, & Turbinado (raw sugar) in the rub. Because of their larger, & non uniform shape they won't burn as easily. This will make creating a truly spectacular "bark" simpler, without the risk of burning
I’m sorry but I really shouldn’t be watching your videos when I’m hungry 😂😂😔
Just curious if this is possible in an oven if you don't have a sousvide machine?
Can you do the same with brisket?
I grew up near Asheville, NC with both a red and white Cole slaw. No, not red cabbage ... A red sauced Cole slaw with a vinegar base.
If your Sous Vide container has a lid, would you still need the plastic wrap? Or is the plastic wrap just a better method?
Does anyone know what the background music is? The link in the description doesn't seem to be correct
you should do spinach quiche from fma:b
Have u tried pulled pork without the a dry rub?
Love your measuring cups! We have the same ones!
You did this North Carolinian proud <3
I am more of a ribs man myself but damn is this pulled pork good
Ok i don't have any money or anything in my fridge and always wanted To tryout pulled pork.... save me
The one good thing that NC has done lol... proud of my state
This boy just pouring barbecue sauce all over his hands
I love how you say "worcestershire" sauce
Y'know. I love this series. But whenever i watch it i get sad. Cause the intro song makes me remember that it was a contest to see what one would get in. I really wanted to do it, but I didn't get around the time to do it..
I love how he says "pork" it's so funny
To be enjoyed in your buddy's backyard with a side of Budweiser.
YOU SHOULD MAKE RECIPES FROM STEVEN UNIVERSE. 

they have cookie cat which is an ice cream sandwich 

Pizza bagel 

Ketchup filled fries 

And probably a lot more things. Such a great show! Hope you see this! Love your videos.
Dislike for using store bought ketchup and mayo. Shame on you, that's not a basic!
Yeah. Ummmm, You lost me, the normal person, at Soovee’ing it.
I get that kosher salt got different properties from regular salt, but it still amuses me to no end when it's included in "unclean" meat like pork. :P
Now I’m waiting for a Babish/Guga collab
I’ve lived in South Carolina for 20 years and almost all coleslaw I’ve had down here has mayo in it. Maybe I’m just not cultured but it’s definitely tastier.
Where do you buy a tiny whisk? I've been looking for months, and even the smallest one I've been able to find isn't mini enough.
what my mom does is she puts the pork in the crockpot for like five hours, then shreds it with forks, then she mixes in the BBQ sauce, then serves it.
By smoker does he mean barbecue BC it kinda looks like one lmao
Tiny wisk!!! The Lil Sebastian of Babish
Is nobody going to comment that he used Brad’s Traeger??? K.
Make pretty patties from spongebob square pants next episode
As soon as you started making coleslaw I knew I was either going to be proud of you or angry at you. Mayonnaise? Why babish?
Is the bone necessary? I live in Germany, and here I have never seen a bone-in pork shoulder. There is more than enough pork to go around (Germany, duh), but never a shoulder with bone. It's always just a peace of meat, often a rather small one (so it dries out too fast), and also often quite lean (so again, too dry, and less flavour). I tried to do a pulled pork several times, and more often than not it was a failure.
Can you make a video about different types of pancakes and hotcakes?
I'd have to say a mustard sauce is superior, BUTT damn that looks awesome. My body is ready for summer cook outs
Hey Babish could you do a Japanese dessert?
Make a cooking show on Netflix please
Hey oliver you should change your name atleast for like an episode to binging with badass but pronounce it simaler and see how many notice just to do it
Dope new balloon whisk tattoo. And another awesome video.
It's music to my ears when North Carolina gets the recognition it deserves! ESPECIALLY Western North Carolinian Barbecue sauce!
I use a crockpot to cook my pork butt, with a tiny amount of whatever liquid you want at the bottom
Basics with Babish.... smoke your meat for 12 hours
Loved the episode but you ruined it with cole slaw.
Pro Tip: If you are British, the cut of meat you want to ask for is called a “Hand and Spring” here. if you ask the butcher for a butt they will look at you funny.
Thank god finally !! 🐷 pulled heaven!
For the record- the smoker he used is a Traeger. Those are not just great for smoking, they can also be used to grill and bake (we've done both with ours); they're awesome. The only downside is the somewhat pricy fuel and the somewhat more fussy start-up and shutdown procedures compared to a charcoal or gas grill.

So yeah, if you're ever looking to get a grill, I strongly recommend making it a Traeger. The versatility is worth it.
7/10 needs SC mustard sauce.
We usually put a little brown sugar in our Carolina BBQ sauce. I mean striaght vinegar and pepper is good but it needs to be cut. Also, I seen a man beaten for using liquid smoke,
Wait what's the difference between a smoker and a grill?
This roast is also commonly refered to as a blade roast.
Pork is soo bad for the human body BUT can I use this seasoning on beef ribs??
How dare you make this in the month of ramadan
Babish is just a mouthpiece of the Pork Board at this point
Babish I love your content and all that you do, but I can’t afford a sous vide and I wish we could see more ways to cook things without them :( I liked the second method you used today though!
You made 2 pork shoulders. There are 2 Carolinas..... So why didn't use one from both? No Carolina gold? I don't even like the taste of mustard but it does something magical to pork. You hating on Carolina Gold?! Lol.
Nah but I feel as though I speak for all of sc when I say SMH😂
Andrew I thought you were on a diet 🤔🙄😂
Pork is disgusting. How can people eat that stuff?
I tried your wok method and I have to say it was the best non barbecued ribs I’ve ever had, tender, juicy, amazing and I went all primal on that shit and ate about 1kg of meat
Binging with croc pots? A new series? Yes or no?
I'm Muslim and I'm fasting today... What am I doing here?!
I require your blue datejust, Andrew.
You get viscosity by ditching all that Carolina nonsense and making a Kansas City-style sauce with a good quantity of molasses in there. Thick and delicious.
Basics with Bad Bitch is the best cooking show on YouTube.
Ahhhh...why did he pour the sauce onto his hand?
GO MAKE MARTABAK U WILL FEEL THE HEAVEN OF FOOD
Hey Babish, do yourself a favor and put it on ciabatta bread. Best decision I ever made.
Wow I live in North Carolina. Crazy
I love Australia because we can still have barbecues during winter so this video still applies.
Come on babyish, no injection? No mop? You my friend need southern guidance
If only I can sous vide ;_;
sous vide bbq pork.......   has science gone too far?
I'm Muslim and it's Ramadan. Why am I watching this
If we don't have a Sous Vide would putting the pork in a plastic bag and using a slow cooker filled with water work?
No mustered base? FOR SHAME
Hey i like your videos but i recently turned vegan, it would be very cool if you could do some badass recipes but vegan, or the same recipe vegan and with flesh, sorry I'm kind of new to this and don't know how to replace the ingredients just yet. Keep it up
Keep making videos dude! Youre amazing!!
Goddamn, I don’t even like pork and that looks delicious
Can't stop looking at his half shaved arm
Were you at Brad's house to use his Traeger?
More vegetarian/vegan stuff would be great
Godbless you for representing Eastern NC. I cannot stand that heretical Western tomato crap
I've made mine before by boiling the crap out of it for 6-7 hours in a large pot flipping every half hour then finishing off with a 1 hour long 400 degree oven bake, shred and add bbq sauce. came out amazing
A lot of people have already said it but mayo based slaw is definitely more common at BBQ joints. Vinegar based I only see at restaurants with an asian fusion of some sort to work with the flavors.
South Carolina would like to have a word with you.
My hunger level went from not hungry at all to starved and salivating in the span of this video
BBQ, then one thing we in NC have done well
What do you mean, "Summer is taking its sweet time getting here"? Here in the Lowcountry, Summer is basically year-round lol
My mans said West North Carolina 😂
You say this is basics and then pull out the sous vide...
I've never been so angry that I have an allergy to paprika
Plot twist national pork board is ran by cows.
That is totally Brad Leone's smoker.
2:03 Worcester Sauce... every time...love it! :D
Wait where the big smoker where’s the whole hog where’s the Carolina treat why does his cole slaw look so sad I’m so confused
"A quarter onion's worth of grated onion."
"national pork board" ... what? :D
Tiny whisk tattoo...I love u Babish
"YOU DON'T NEED NO TEETH.... TO EAT OUR MEAT!"
YOU SAY IT AS WUSTER SAUCE CAN YOU PLEASE TRY ITS HURTING MY ENGLISHNESS
If you want to be authentic you gotta use Duke's mayo.
For the next Thanksgiving special what about monk fish turducken from malcolm in the middle?
These are so much better with a toasted bun and a topped on the bun with a homemade Cole slaw. Horseradish is also a good add on to the sandwich..The real stuff not flavored mayo
As a North Carolinian, I approve.
Damn Babish bringing in sponsorship from the guys who made Bacon a meme. Now that's a step up from Squarespace
Yo tennesssee has better barbecue than north or South Carolina and it’s a southern classic,not specifically north or South Carolina,they have barbecue(pulled pork) everywhere in the south
I never seen that type of smoker am old school
please do the ads at the end. when you immediately start the video and you get straight to cooking business it just makes a satisfying video to watch, it also makes me more inclined to watch the end of the video because you did that. i have noticed other content creators doing that i just have to appreciate it even more.
why don't you add the ingredients in the description ffs
....and now I need to got get me some sweet sweet pork.
Basics babish basic you exspect is to have a vacuume machine
Thats it! I'm bbq'ing this weekend!

Can you do Emperor's New Groove part 2?

3 pork combos with extra bacon on the side, 2 chili cheese sampler, a basket of liver and onions, a catch of the day and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.

In Kronk's words:
"3 oinkers wearing pants, a plate of hot air, a basket of grandma's bfast, and change the bull to a gill."
I like pork butts and I cannot lie....
You should really mention that the video is biased and sponsored more clearly and not quickly in the last few seconds of the video...
Do we have validated proof that the tiny whisk isn't a lie?
I feel like it’s a crime he hasn’t done cinnamon pie from psych yet
babish you scared me there almost thought you forgot coleslaw
No mustard based BBQ sauce? It’s really the only way to eat pulled pork in South Carolina
You ignored South Carolina style mustard sauce.  You are now dead to me and the rest of my state.
I'm not sure that going for 12 hours is strictly necessary, I go for 6-8 in a dutch oven version and no one has been able to tell the difference when I do it.
Is there a more beautiful sentence than “the fat bates the pork as it melts in the smoker”???
i don’t like seeing the shave patch Andrew
Born & bred South Carolinian here—great video, but you NEED a mustard-based BBQ sauce. It’s not optional. It must be present. (Somewhat biased, but also, you can’t say “Carolinian classic” and not represent both Carolinas.)
Sorry if I’m being ignorant but I always thought pork shoulder was expensive in Australia? I always have trouble calculating the value with meat on the bone though so if you have any tips for that would be greatly appreciated :)
Looks good, but it’s also too complicated for a home cook.
I read it "bullied pork"
How many takes did you have to do before you could make those butt jokes without laughing? Be honest.
I have found in my dozens of smoked butts and shoulders that throwing a slathering of yellow mustard on the meat before covering it in the spice rub helps to make a KILLER bark and upping the flavor just that much more.
TINY WHISK HAS OFFICIALLY BEEN IMORTALISED
Can you make peter griffons energy drink
Babish daft question but have you ever considered "Cleaning with Babish" as the amount of people who don't know how to properly clean the cooking utilities they are using properly is shocking!
Guess what im having for dinner tomorrow.
so nobody is talking about the fact that he literally got a tiny whisk tattoo that is larger than the actual tiny whisk.
Could you do the second method in the oven if you put some oven safe bowls of water in their? I know it's not the same as a smoker, but I don't have a souvide
Bell peppers and beef from cowboy bebop:)
All I can say is that looks spot on and make sure you try some of the local affair if you're ever in town babish.
Smoked Paprika, Chipotle Powder AND Smoked Salt for an oven/ sous vide method. You can coat the meat with a brushing of liquid smoke and then shake on the rub. Ya gotta use TEXAS PETE'S Hot Sauce... It's made in NC! 


Good stuff, Babish!
Is there a way to make this without a sous vide machine?
Two days old and you have a million views.  You have arrived, my friend!
All you dorks getting food tattoos are so funny.  Tattoos used to be cool now they are just another way for people to constantly be shouting at us when they are not on their social media platform doing.  The tats do not make you a chef just like stickers don't make cars go faster.
please make rig juice from regular show
Summers been here in Arizona for a month now!
So... Who actually has a 'sous vide' lying around the house?
My boy really got a tattoo mid video lol what a god, food looks really good too
Also add some wiskshishtoire sauce
Hey babish here is a challenge from my state of Florida. Gator tail. It isn't actually bad but I'd be really interested to see you try
Still pretty coooooold for summer.. even spring..
Would this be the same with chicken?
Need a take on the Superior SC Mustard based sauce!!
Here, I’ll help ‘wuster sheer sauce’

Tryna squeeze in a southern and Brooklyn accents
How would I do this on a gas grill?
Why couldn’t you have posted this yesterday before I put yucky kraft barbecue sauce on my pulled pork. I didn’t even think of doing a vinegar based sauce. That would’ve been delicious 😫
Given that this is a basics show, wouldn't it be more appropriate to show a method without sous vide? It's a pretty specialist item that not many average people own.
Better than anything I can get around Wilmington
What do you do when you don't have sous vide or a smoker?
For an easier method for those of us who do not have access to a smoker or sou vide, crockpot is a great way to go. Especially when you start it in the morning, leave for work, then come home to delicious pulled pork 😍
Dry ground mustard ? i never seen or heard of that, also liquid smoke i have heard about it in some other american videos but man that shit doesnt exist in my country you smoke it or not :D
Any way to do this indoors without the sous vide?
There’s an amazing pulled pork recipe(I can’t remember where it is, but I’ll link it if I find it), but it’s chipotle and Dr Pepper pulled pork, and it’s GREAT. It basically involves in putting a pork butt in a bath of the Dr Pepper/chipotle+adobo/other spice mixture in a big ceramic pot and letting it simmer over medium low for about 8 hours
Aye shout out from the Carolinas
Where my Carolina Gold at doh? T_T
i dont count pulled pork as bbq but i still love it
My mom has this amazing pulled pork recipe - she adapted an old beef tips recipe into a pulled pork bbq one.  It was absolutely amazing, she made it in the crock pot, it's this sweet and tangy thing, I will never forget it.

I live in NC, and our pulled pork is unlike anything you'd see here.  Would 100% recommend using a crock pot, btw, for pulled pork, it makes it the most tender fall-apart pulled pork ever.
Babish. YOU NEED TO TOAST URE BUNSSSS!!!
you really need to change the name. nothing youre doing is basic to the point of overkill. it should be "ridiculously complicated cooking with babish"
I would love to see sous vide bbq pork ribs
Why can’t I be this good at cooking drool
Please do a chicken marsala recipe!
People hate on pork. Why? Its cheap and delicious

If I don't have a sous vide, what can I use?
I’m embarrassed by how much my mouth watered while watching this. Like....holy crap.
My parents make it with onions and i think in a crockpot and it tastes gross. It only tastes like onions.
BURRITOS!!! Should be next...
There’s a time and a place for liquid smoke... never and in the trash!
Sous vide??? Where is Guga?👀
That is not no gotdam half cup of brown sugar and you know it lmao
The holder for the Anova will break from heat, the part with the clamp is plastic where it wraps around the unit. If it breaks in the back half, it can release the unit into water. I used a silicon egg ring around the band to ensure it all stays together during long use.
Shameful didn’t make mustered based BBQ sauce.

Babish can you do foods from chowder?
Babish u forgot some chemical X in the rub
I would love to know what kind of cling wrap he's using because I haven't ever seen anything like it. The cling wrap in my country doesn't look like that so maybe it's a US thing?
Babish, do you actually know how to pronounce Worcestershire? I’ve been watching since day one and never heard you say it without it being silly. Whether you do or don’t doesn’t matter. It makes me laugh and I’ve made numerous of the recipes you’ve shown on your channel. I’ve been to culinary school and yet you teach me more per episode than they did the entirety of my schooling. Thank you, sir.
What are you talking bout? Its hot af in California
ok this seems like way too much effort ...
How necessary is sugar in a dry rub? I was just diagnosed with diabetes and I love to grill and barbecue, but I need to change a lot of the things I use in cooking. any suggestions?
Ramadan Mubarak LOL wtf am I doing here
You got a total fail with the indoor version, but redeemed yourself a bit with the smoked, and surpassed with the addition of coleslaw to the pulled pork sandwich! I never let people at my bbqs ever say no to that combo, lol

And for those looking for a great bbq rub try Killer Hogs 'The BBQ Rub'. You will not be disappointed!
Worcestershire is pronounced like Wooster lol
Haha drink evertime he says butt😂😂😂
At what temp was it sous vide:ed?
In what world is sous vide basics?
Oh man. I needed this video last week
Why do you look like Michele from vsauce

The one thing i cannot find in any store - even spice stores is onion powder :/
Babish, was that brad leone's smocker I saw
Casually gets a tattoo in middle of video
i feel very immature for laughing at all the butt jokes
I was going to tear into him for not doing the regular way but he at least showed it somewhat at the end lols
I bought a lid for my sous vide container. It's got a hinge so half of it can be opened and closed, and it's got a hole that is just the right size for my immersion cooker. I've managed to do 48-hour cookin's in a tub the same size as yours without needing to top off the water, as the lid reduces the open area by probably more than 95%. You can find lids on Amazon designed specifically for this purpose. Just check and double-check that the lid you're picking out is designed to fit the exact container you have.
W8 is dat a small weeb sword on the bg at da begining
Proposition to change tiny whisk to baby whisk.
Pulled pork is my favorite
I hate coleslaw but the pork looked delicious
Nice trick with the disappearing tattoo.
There's absolutely nothing basic about this....
Can u do this with beef for your viewers who don’t eat pork?
WTF dude? How can you talk about BBQ from "The Carolinas" and leave out South Carolina??? Where's the mustard based sauce? Where's the vinegar based sauce? That ketchup shit will get you run out of town on a rail down here!
kinda wanna see babish and brad together and get some vinnie mooments
OUTRO SONG PLS :(
For those of you wondered why it's called Pork Butt despite being the pig's shoulder, it's because in ye olden days, pork shoulders were stored in barrels for salt curing called Butt Barrels. So yes, a butt is a unit of measurement. Specifically 475 to 500 liters. So you also know what a butt load of something is too.
Yo Babish. Money is cool and all but what is not cool is being sponsored by the National Pork Board, a litteral lobby group for meat eating. Could you please do a video on vegan/vegetarian pulled "pork" (cauliflower or jackfruit maybe) sometime? I, and many others, would love that I assure you!
I do this in 12 hours with 2 - 3 boston butts at the same time.  I use a nice hard wood (the kind your mom likes) typically hickory and applewood.  I do not have to use a rub unless I am looking for a particular color.  And the sauce, Sweet Baby Rays.  Perfect every time.
Hmm...Carolinians may consider this sacrilege, but I’d want to try a spice rub with a secret ingredient: a packet or two of the spice they use at the Japanese ramen chain Ichiran. 

I’ve used it before for non-ramen applications, and it has an earthy flavor to it while still being pretty damn hot. I’d try it myself, but making pulled pork at home in Japan is pretty much impossible.
Is that Brad from Bon Appetite's smoker?
Ignores Mustard BBQ supremacy O_O
my fav food....Stromboli and pulled pork
Where my Eastern North Carolinians at?
Looks delicious but but I don’t eat pork😞
Is nice to see you dipping your butt in water.
If you have a family member who can't handle spice can you just take it out and add a bit more smoked paprika to help or a just make a herby bbq sauce? Just asking because my mum can't handle spice very well and can make her a bit unwell but so want to make a lovely pulled pork lunch for us 🙂
Ok, now u will make my lunch
His commitment to tiny whisk is beautiful
My dad literally just got a Traeger brand grill. Like, last week.
Here is a way I've found to do it with a grill that takes less time but gives you the same results. Grill over low indirect heat with wood chips for about 4 hours (you can go as long as you want). Once the pork is starting to get a nice smokey look to it pull it off the grill and put it in a pressure cooker (or Instapot) with a little liquid for 30 minutes. It will fall off the bone and be super easy to shred.
What about if my friend is a smoker
Being from NC this makes me happy
you should live in a suburb so that you can use a smoker without restriction, i mean choose a location where you won't be sued from all the smoke you're gonna be doing.
Why did I watch this on an empty stomach...
Something ab this video felt different 🤔🤔🤔
I can already feel this between my teeth lmfao
Love this. Thanks 🇨🇦
Where is South Carolina's mustard based sauce???????????!!!!!
I wonder whats the easiest thing your made
I've never known coleslaw to not have mayo
A blueberry bagel makes for a better bun.
Love your show, but I feel like for a ‘basics’ episode using two cooking methods that most people don’t have access to in their kitchen is a little strange.... might have missed the point on this one...
Again it's not pronounced war stir shyer it's pronounced woos ter
Didn’t u have that tattoo already!?? 🧐
I now need to see a tri-tip episode of Basics.
Wheres the mustard sauce babish? Gotta represent us South Carolinians.
Brad's backyard???!???
Wait I thought you already had the wisk tattoo
I love that the smoker is a Traeger-ian
Sorry, but pork butt is butt! It's the rear shoulder, also known as the butt!
Can you make food from fantastic mr fox
Red meat is really bad for the environment.
Who doesnt like to pull their pork? 😂
Try letting it rest, a big muscle like that has a lot of stored heat. When you shred it all that steam was moisture between the muscles. It seems to help.
Pulled Pork, more like... Pulled Dork.. Gottee.
I need to get a sous vide machine...
You are my new favorite youtuber

What about pulled chicken for those who can’t eat pork?
Do you americans put sugar in everything?

On great thing about NC pulled pork is the more you shred the better it is. Big chunks are heartier but smaller bits hold more sauce.

That's an acceptable Eastern NC BBQ sauce, but my personal favorite variant is even more simple. Just bring two cups of apple cider vinegar to a light boil and pour over about three tablespoons of crushed red peppers. That's all you need really! Of course, you can customize this endlessly and lots of families have secret ingredients.
Yay for the tiny whisk!
getting pretty tired of everything having sugar in it. can this be made without getting type 2 diabetes?
I wanna see this man with Gordon ramsay
I know this is basics not binging but can you do the all of the foods in Matt Smith’s first episode as doctor who. Specifically fish fingers and custard.
Rhett and Link want to know your location
Babish has a nice butt. Get it? Butt. No? Okay D:
The thumbnail alone made me hungry
Texas bbq sauce still tops
I wish he had done the indoor version a less complicated way so I could have copied it, since I also live in an apartment without a grill. I barely know how to make pulled pork, let alone how to sous vide a pork shoulder man. This was supposed to be "basics".
I love you, man.
You need to do BBQ pork steaks.
I feel like it’s a little inappropriate to use a Su Vide (yes I spelled that wrong probably) in a basics with babish video. There are others ways to get the same outcome
Please collaborate with Guga foods!!
I missed his old videos where his face was not in the videos
A B O U T  O N E  C U P
I'm from NC and that BBQ looks amazing. Def gonna try the indoor version. Also, my preferred slaw is the way my grandmother made it: cabbage, mayo, apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper, a pinch of sugar, and a small amount of mustard.
As a North Carolinian I approve

All those butt jokes @3:28 😂
Hey! Have you found any alternative meats you can use or even a vegetarian option for those of us that can't eat pork or even meat? I've heard shredded and smoked jackfruit  on a bun can be pretty delicious. Worth an episode?
A while back I was able to turn a boston butt into pulled pork using my instant pot... you have to cube the meat beforehand and season each cube in flavor dust, then sear it in the pan, then add your sauce of choice and some water and let it pressure cook. It was super juicy and flavorful and while the crust that the searing gave it wasn't as prominent, it was heckin delicious.
If you ever find yourself in the Piedmont of North Carolina, Charlotte is home to some of the best BBQ in the state. The best choices in my opinion are Queen City Q in uptown or McKoys in South Charlotte. Everyone will tell you that Midwood smokehouse is the best and they are right, the only problem is that you can't get in the door on a weekend night and I've went there and the wait time be close to 2 hours on more than one occasion. My city has the best BBQ. You made this north Carolinian proud!
You can pull my pork anytime
While not the only way to make Cole slaw, mayo vinegar slaw is totally common in the Carolinas.  You find some with mustard as well, but no one would make a stink about your slaw I would say.
Very nice butt you have there :D lol
North Carolina BBQ is vinegar based 
South Carolina BBQ is mustard based
1:05 Wait so are you trying to tell me that Professor Utonium was actually just trying to make some nice pulled pork when he created the Powerpuff Girls?

I am watching this while eating a pb&j with pickles on it. everyone says this is gross but it isn't. Will you consider making this and trying it I wanna prove that it isn't bad haha
I’m watching this at lunch while eating my lunch and each bite I imagine it’s the pulled pork. Thanks
Sure looks like a half cup
My NC crockpot bbq tends to go more along the super apple-y side. I do a dry rub (cayenne, garlic salt, coffee grounds, salt, and either light brown sugar or turbinado sugar *pineapple sugar is actually really good if doing a hawaiin variant*) for 24 hrs before, bone in piece of course, once ready for the slow cooker, I quarter sweet onions for a bed for the meet and liberally salt them to create an onion brine, load up the meat, and add about 16 oz of hard cider, a cup of apple cider vinegar, pork stock if you have any (I've subbed in vegetable, and chicken before, havent tried veal yet) a heavy hand of w-sauce, and apple wood smoke marinade. I tend to add honey if I find it should be sweeter, but I also make candied bacon and have used my own home made syrup for that to great effect as well
Its called barbeque you goddamn yankee
Memphian here....glad to see this video showing all the ways of pulled pork! I'm not a total purist and think that every region has a good way to do pulled pork.  Though I like it best smoked, in the oven is a great way to do it when that's your only option.

I recently made one of these in a slow cooker and it was the juiciest meat I've ever eaten.  Didn't remove any fat, which meant that it spent hours slowly cooking in liquefied deliciousness (along with some thick sliced onions).  I don't recommend putting a crust on it in the oven unless you want it to dry out a bit.

That auto pellet feeder isn't bbq'ing. At that point, you're just baking. Go to Walmart and pick up their cheapest, non-gas, grill. Make a set-up with that and get your smoke ring on it. I won't even be impreesed then since that's the way I do it.

I've said this before, and it will sound weird, but try McCormick's Taco Seasoning with some brown sugar to save yourself a bunch of time with the dry rub.  Read the ingredients on the back and it ticks off a TON of the same things on many popular dry rubs.  :)

Your butt looks delicious.
Why the heck did you throw away the extra fat? have you never heard of cracklins?
Liquid smoke is "Real Smokey Flavor!" At it's core, it's just smoke, condensed into a liquid, filtered for impurities and concentrated. As it turns out it isn't actually that efficient to try to synthesize the complex variety of chemicals that make up "smoke" flavor when you can just burn some wood and capture the smoke. There is no shame in using liquid smoke if you can't smoke things properly, it's not all that different from using natural vanilla extract if you can't get your hands on vanilla beans.
actual smoked one looked more like a picnic cut, blech. next time just go get yourself a  nice boston butt, 8+ pounds not those tiny things

how to do it at home : pork roast, clean , rub , fridge for 12 hours, oven for 24  hours at around 80 first 8 then 90c the last 4 , leave a pan below it on a grate to pick up drippings ,

coleslaw; 75% white cabbage 25% carrots, grate, add - mayo,vinegar, salt , peber, pinch of sugar, abit of lemon juice,and a tea spoon of some strong dijon mustard, or coarse mustard... cheap, and easy to do , takes almost no time ,and can be done in a normal oven .

I was very skeptical of the sous vide pork butt.

But I was pleasantly surprised.  Way better than the crock pot/can of coke abominations we see on Facebook.
BBQ is looking for Coleslaw, not mayonnaise cabbage. I hate coleslaw myself, but as a Southerner, I cannot let that go unnoticed. Proper coleslaw should have cabbage, red cabbage and carrot shreds + salt, pepper, vinegar, and mayo. Make a good one as you always do!

Wasn't that brads house?
Great episode. One quick thing, putting the fat cap up doesn't baste the meat. It is kept juicy by the intramuscular fat (marbling) that renders and turns to collagen. The gives the meat that juicy, sticky, unctuous mouth feel. The only reason to keep the fat cap up is to protect it from a heat source that is above the meat.  In the Traeger, the heat source is at the bottom so the fat cap should be down to protect the meat from drying out during a long cook.  Just a note from a bbq guy who has cooked a few thousand butts.
Thats a nice Tiny whisk

Thank god this video exists now. Whenever my mom makes pulled pork, she cooks it in the crockpot during the day, and OH MY GOD IT'S SO AWFUL. Please no one ever do this - boiling your meat is a bad idea, especially if you don't plan on crisping it up in an oven or something afterward. Good to know there's a more accessible video now though so that no one will have to experience this and get pulled pork ruined for them.

If you care little about your health you can score the fat into squares before barbecuing that way when you take it out you have little chunks of fat that absorbed a crap ton of rub and melts in your mouth.

Opening my food truck this weekend and will sell primarely pulled pork wraps so kind of fun to see you post this today. I cant use a smoker and ive done alot of experiements with the oven method cause thats what I can use in my food truck. Id say skip the liquid smoke and simply add more smoked paprika and chipotle. Other than that you can go in basicly any flavour profile you want, im going for a sort of mexican vibe with koriander and guacamole. Id also like to point out that marinading your pork putt for 1-3 nights really makes all of the meat super tasty and not just the crust.

I'm not throwin' shade Andrew. I'm not. I got nothin' but love for your success and all that you're doin'. I know I'm gonna get some hate over this, but this 'recipe' is by no means BBQ. You know what it is ? Sugar. Dude, I usually am drooling by what you put out. Seriously, once or twice you've given me a new perspective on a food that I hadn't necessarily had before. This time you've crossed my line. You're screwin' with BBQ my friend, and that, whatever the eff that was is NOT by any stretch of my imagination BBQ. The problem ? The rub.  Every pitmaster has their secret rub. However, most of what you put in that rub was sugar. Yes, the sugar will carmelize, and yes the sugar will create a bark, but it will also give it a false flavor. We want the pork butt's flavor not the sugar's! I recently watched a video with a texas style BBQ guy, who said in one of his videos that "Your first few times you try to make BBQ, you're going to fail. Miserably. It takes months, if not years to perfect the trim, the shape just so, and above all else, the rub. Screw up the rub with white sugar and you're just asking for trouble."

I have neither a smoker, a friend with a smoker, nor a suove... soupve? An immersion heater to cook a pork butt with.

I have a very small home frier, a very LARGE turkey firer, oven (of course), and a crockpot slow cooker.
any suggestions?
I honestly have grown to love tiny whisk like a father, or even more than that, a soulmate.
I am from South Carolina and mayo in the coleslaw is how I have always gone! Babish making me feel insecure now! lol
South Carolinian here, highly recommend a mustard based sauce with pulled pork, it's simply amazing!
Yummy!
My simple pulled pork:
Take your pork roast, and rub with granulated garlic, granulated onion, chili powder, Cayenne pepper, Black Pepper, Cumin, and salt. I do not measure these spices, I just add to my particular taste, and realize these will be very diluted over the course of the cooking time. After rubbing this in, I place it in a ziplock bag and keep it over night in the fridge. Next morning at 7:30am, I place the pork roast into my cast iron skillet to brown the sides, not the ends. The I put it in my crockpot. I take Herdez Guacamole salsa, pour about 6 oz into the crockpot. I add enough water to  reach the top of the pork roast. I cook this in the crockpot on high until 2:30pm, then I turn the crockpot to low and cook until 6:30pm. At 3:30pm I add quartered potatoes. At 5:30pm I add chopped Bell pepper, onion, pasilla and Anaheim peppers. At 6:30pm I take it out and serve it. I add water as needed when the juice begins to evaporate leaving too much of the pork roast exposed, and drying out.

When I've done pulled pork it's been a mix of these. Cooked in a slow cooker in whats basically the vinegar Bbq sauce. When it's almost done remove and shred the pork, reduce the vinegar mix, and add a Ketchup. Then mix the pulled pork with the sauce in the slow cooker.
Hey Babish, would you ever consider doing a vegan/meat replacements episode? Like, how to get the most mileage out of  popular protein alternatives like tofu, tempeh, seitan, jackfruit, and so on? I know I would appreciate it!

Pork is unclean meat. Eating it will probably not end well. And why would you put kosher salt into pulled pork? Anyway, God tells us not to eat these foods for our health.
Carolina vinegar based bbq sauce is the literal best I honestly can’t comprehend why you would use the ketchup with a little bit of extra flavor sauce
Remember guys. 
Only put vinegar or mustard based sauces on your pork.
Ketchup is a shameful condiment.

I know you're a New York dude, but thank you for giving Louisiana Original love for your mop. I don't see it enough in home style recipes. We use the vinegar pepper base style in some parts of the Sandhills here in SC too.

Also, you should give Carolina Gold a spin for a cook along. 

Respect. As always.
Would it be sacrilegious to ask for a slow cooker version?
You can use mustard to to make the spice rub stick a little better plus adds a nice flavor
Just rub the mustard all over the butt before you rub
How can I get the National Pork Board to sponsor me? (Pork Board I am open to options)

You know Babish is courting the millennial demographic with this episode because it’s all about eating butt.
What if Spider Ham sees this video? 🐖🐷
Don't ea too much Babish remember that you'r on a diet
Or you could just put it in a crock pot and let it go for 8 hours, it wont have the same barbequed effect, but it's still pulled pork
I should be revising but here we are
Time is off between mouth movement and mouth sound.

Really wanted to see a Yellow Mustard BBQ Sauce. I must be a minority over most who enjoy a tomato-based sauce.
As soon I heard that Babish uploaded a new video, I PULLED My phone quickly...


Sorry
This came at a perfect time since we just bought a smoker!! 😁
Hey Bab I sent you an email about that sauce word ,just trying to be helpful .Love your show ,its a must watch in our house.
I use dill pickle juice instead of vinegar in slaw.
No one:
Babish: squeezes bbq sauce on bare hand
Why am I torturing myself by  watching this I'm on a diet
Alternatively you can put it in the smoker for a while on smoke only and then sous vide it.
Or you could just stick the butt in a slow cooker with some coca-Cola and let it cook for 8 hours. Works every time.
Hey hey hey that ain't Carolina slaw you're missing two tablespoons of sugar to make it sweet and tangy and it's western slaw that don't use mayo

Was that tattoo done by a friend? Or a professional? The line work looks spotty at best.
You forgot the mustard-based sauce. Loved the show otherwise.
As an Eastern Carolinian, I approve of the vinegar sauce, however an addendum you might wish to add to the sauce is a teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes. That's how I've always seen it done.
Okay ima be real with ya, this aint basic. Folks, just grab a few aromatics (carrots, etc) grab your pork butt or whatever you picked for it and stick it in a crock pot for a few hours.

In North Carolina, it's actually rather common to have Mayo in Cole slaw. Mustard, and a bit of sugar too. Some times diced pickles and some carrot too
did he just non-chalantly get a tattoo mid video lol!? Damn I love this guy
Being a person who has lived in Raleigh for 20 years the word barbecue is music to my ears. However I recommend if you want the pork to be really tender baste with pineapple juice while its cooking does wonders to the flavor and the quality of the meat you can even add it to the rub.
I’m from uk and it’s pronounced woo-ster sauce.

You should coat the meat with yellow mustard to help the rub stick.
I usually brine my pork. Should I not or is there a reason you didn't? Oh probably cause you sous-vide it
You don't necessarily need a smoker. You can smoke stuff on a kettle grill as well. Just a lot of effort to get the temperature right and a lot of set up.
I recently did pulled pork before this video. So annoyed you didn't have the recipe out sooner

You forgot to say: Pimienta negra recien molida
BBQ in the Carolinas is a Tradition... Sue Vee needs to stay away from it.  But you got it right the second time.  
Low and Slow, and never... Never... do just one.  Pork Butts come in Pairs, so that's how you cook them.  Enough for You, your Fam, and enough to give to folks who couldn't make it over.  And enough for leftovers for Tacos and Burritos.  Because all Meat is Taco Meat.
At least in my part of the Carolinas mayo is traditional in slaw but I’m sure my fellow Carolinians will back me up in saying that Duke’s mayo is the only way to go
you said the word of sous vide, don't do that and think its going to be anywhere as close to good as smoking it.  Smoke that butt, low and slow with a good hardwood charcoal and some cherry and apple wood.  don't put it in the pretentious hipster cooking device and think it will be as good as a real smoke.  no bark, no flavor, no smoke ring, no burnt ends.
i have the same tongs lol
Whoop whoop. NC represent.
When are you gonna do face reveal?
Carolina barbecue and you say "SAWS" like a Brooklynite? C'mon, Babby
I feel like you made this way more complicated than necessary.  Not everyone has the equipment to sous vide
I'd like to see you talk about other bbq sauces some time. KC likes a molasses based bbq sauce for example.
Secrets to bbq: salt before rub, clean hardwood, blue smoke and lots of patience.
Replace the sous vide with an instant pot, and you've got pulled pork in less than 6 hours!
I just learned you can keep and use cheese rinds in soup.  I can't find much good information on that so it'd be awesome to see a video on it!
That's also the ingredients to make powerpuff girls?
>Basics

>Vacuum seal and sous vide.
sooo... your sponsor just wants us to eat pork ?dont matter where from ? lol
someone should make a compilation of all the variation of worshetschershire sauce babish has used
more of a Hawaiian kalua pork kinda guy
🤔 is that it’s alive Brads backyard???
Babish eating butts today. Needs a NSFW tag.
Ja vi elsker! Noen fra Norge?
Was this Brad's smoker?
Ay babish chest gains
Warning for those with fish allergies: worcestershire sauce has fish in it!
I just stick a pork butt in a Crock-Pot with a bottle of BBQ
babish: north carolinian pulled pork
kansans have left the chat
jk I'll still watch it because all bbq is beautiful, just ours is the most beautiful
Basic=/= Sous vide. Cmon babby
Babish, you're reading my mind! I'm doing smoked pulled pork for a party this weekend and was looking for a good recipe! Perfect timing.
Can you do a vid on St. Louis and KC dry rubs and bbq sauce? Thanks. Love your channel
You should make the jellyfish Krabby patty, to tribute barnacle boy Rest In Peace
The way you pronounced Worcestershire made me laugh as a Brit
No one ever talks about how they want to rub Babish’s bald, smooth head for good luck, so I will.
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁MR. BABISH YOU SHOULD MAKE THE PASTIES OR THE DRINK FROM ESCANABA IN DA MOONLIGHT 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I cook my pork shoulder in a mixture of apple cider vinegar and lemon for 5 - 8hrs, season it and serve. For those who need a quick pulled pork.
The ongoing difficulty of saying 'Worscetstesthire sauce' continues
I don't like spiral cut ham that much but pulled pork whew.
Don't forget you can also just drop a seasoned pork shoulder into a crock pot with a bit of your favourite liquid. Cook on high for a bit then on low overnight. Easiest way to get moist and tender pulled pork. I like to pan crisp them a bit depending on what I'll be using it for. Cheers!
No one:

Babish: kosher salt...
Please make the cheesecake from friends ‘the one with all the cheesecakes’! X
I too weigh down my butts with bowls.
Do a cooking with Jack recipe
I’m watching this just for fun but in my opinion nothing beats my dads smoked pulled pork recipe
Animal stress and overcrowding are so prevalent in industrialized pig farms that pigs will chew on the tails of the pigs surrounding them. The National Pork Board advocates chopping off their tails (usually without pain relief) as a solution. Then the pigs need drugs to prevent infection. The stress is still there, but the pigs can no longer express it by chewing tails. Just another fun pork fact brought to you by the national pork board.
Should have just used a crock pot!
Better eastern style sauce: crushed red pepper, black pepper, and apple cider vinegar. Bring to a low simmer, while avoiding breathing while near it cause it hurts. Source: am eastern NC resident and lover of all things pork.
2:45 D-did... did he just frantic wheezing did you just throw the fat into the trash? You monster.
Babish: worces-ces-ces-ces-ces-ces...

Legend has it, he is still going...
As someone from eastern NC, thanks for showing our vinegar based sauce.
I love how you do this for so long, but still can’t spell Worcestershire correctly 😂😂
Y'all... Speaking as a girl from Lexington, NC, you really needed to put some red slaw on that sandwich. Come to the BBQ Festival in October to see how it's done.
"Worcestsvevsteesr sauce" - Binging with babish
pfff babby thinks Texans need summer to make pulled pork hes so cute that way
If I learned anything from this, it's that a person from the Carolinas are called Carolinians.
Personally I pressure cook mine in the cold hellish winters of Canada and in the
Summer smoke it in a egg shell smoker
Pro tip don’t use banana peels in substitute for pork.
But Babish, what if I don't have a souvide or a smoker?
Have you ever been to sugarfire in St. Louis? Best pulled pork I’ve ever had
Instant like for tapatio in your bbq sauce
Maybe some smokehouse beef brisket?
better calm down there, you might get age restricted
This pulled pork definitely is better than the one I’m planning to make tomorrow. All I have is a crock pot.
is a matter of taste I guess, before becoming a vegetarian I used to love pork (ecuadorian style) but pulled pork was never my cup of tea...southern style food in general was never my cup of tea, guess I never found a place that did it right, which is weird cause living there you would think you would find that at every corner

Watching this while beating eggs with tiny whisk..... wow that was not supposed to be dirty. Okay then......
Can't wait to try this on my Traeger!
EASTERN NC BABY!!!
You just made my good day even better.

Thanks Andrew.
You did a Carolina style bbq and didn't use DUKES Mayo? Really? Well, I guess that's a decision. A wrong decision.
The slight pause in the intro song around 0:17 always triggers me. Why u do this babish
The constant and deliberate butchery of "Worcestershire" keeps me going.
May I ask, what's the difference between kosher salt and regular sea salt or table salt?
Hey if I wanted a softer slaw would you recommend mixing it in salt after chopping then rinsing after letting it sit a while or do you know a better way?
1:07 where is the "let the flavours get to know each other"
The Meateorite joke was actually the best one
I rarely comment on videos but as an eastern NC native I approve this message. Vinegar based is the only way to go.....except I saw no red chili pepper flakes. But I can forgive.
I legit want this theme song as my ringtone. Anyone know where I can get it?
Are we not going to talk about how you missed a huge opportunity to say "probing the butt?"
I just realized how hairy you are mister babish
I shouldn't have watched this now I want pulled pork
Stop putting Mayo on coleslaw.
NPB...
..."For all pigkind".
You should do a pork belly episode soon
You should try it with barbecue coleslaw
Love you man!!! Lol
Good tiny whisk ink Babish 👍
i killed my souvide stick like this....
I'm too immature for this episode 😂
I was in tears from laughing like a third-grader.
"let the sous vide touch the butt" 🤣
oh honey I love you but stop leaving your fresh tattoos exposed to HOT FOOD 
please.
Can You make the "Pretty Patties" from Spongebob please
looks out at 85+ humid Georgia weather what are you talking about summer not being here yet? I've been melting since late March over here lol
I literally just had homemade pulled pork for dinner last night
I live in South Carolina (low country) and we prefer mustard based sauce, but I like vinegar sauce more... also, sc makes better bbq than anyone, facts.
Is there nit going to be a livestream for this episode of basics? Was looking forward to a 24 hour sous vide? (Dunno how to spell) live stream
If you want to pronounce Worcestershire... think of it like "Wuss-ter-sure" (or shire instead of sure depends on your accent).
Please, please please make the ramen from Naruto
Vinegar based sauce are the apple maps of sauces
DAMNIT BABISH, YOURE KILLING ME MAN
Pulled pork needs pickles or pickled jalapeños
North not South Carolina we do whole pig
Pork baby! Greatest meat ever.

Woo-stuh-shuh, or just Wooster sauce.

"YoU cAn pUlL oN mY pOrK"
THANK YOU FOR GIVING THE CAROLINAS THE CREDIT WE DESERVE
From East Carolina, I approve!
Missed South Carolina's mustard bbq sauce but fantastic bbq nonetheless
It looks like you were using your own butter. Is that something you are regularly doing now, or just a leftover from a previous video?
so you’re saying WNC/Lexington style is better? my man!
My NC heart is happy.  He made both our sauces!
Heard somewhere that ol vinny bo binny films for babs now. Anyone know if that’s true?
TIL there's a national pork board.
Tiny wisk is getting a workout.
Is sous vide the new crock pot?
If you don't have a sous vide and you can't cook outside I highly recommend Food Wishes' Paper Pork. Only equipment you really need is an oven and something to roast your pork in. You won't get a bark, but that basically vanishes when you shred it anyway. Plus you can always unwrap it to finish roasting if you really, absolutely must have a bark.
Jesus Christ, Babish!
......there's a national pork board?
Waaaaaaaaaaaay too sugar, and where is the cayenne and cumin in the rub? That's gonna come off way too sweet with little to no spice. I'd recommend a combo of ground chipotle for some heat and great smokiness along with a huge amount of cayenne since pork shoulder stands up nicely with good spicy heat which you need badly if you're putting that much sugar in. Really you should cut the amount in half and only use demerara or raw sugar instead of white and brown sugar. You also forgot the mustard, either ground mustard seed or actual yellow mustard from the bottle, in the sauce. I'm glad to see you used mostly vinegar at least.
Make a dish from Chowder
That's gyros

He touched the butt

East>West in terms of NC BBQ. Change my mind.
Babish, ruining my diet willpower since 2016! For the love of god man! This is too good!

Babish  talking about placing his butt in hot water had me salivating for more reasons than one
I just got a new tattoo as well. Love your tattoos 😊.
Salt? Where is the salt in all  your recipies, you got there like 2kg of raw meat and you added tiny bit of salt in to the rub, like wtf
If you are smoking pork. Make sure to let it rest for about a hour before you pull it.
I couldn’t find the written version of these recipes on your website. Are they posted a certain time after the video is posted or am I just missing them? I checked on the basics page.

Excited to try the sous vide version!
2:46  you just started putting the rub on and its already all gone. What happened to the rest of it?
Could you please do a basics about wings.
It’s already summer here. It’s been almost 90 degrees here all week.

Hi (to all my 100% loyal family)

Another thing is.

So.

1. I know for a fact that the ESTJ 14 Asian liked me. 
(Well because of what my dad typed so apparently she did “like me”)

 But what I DONT KNOW for a fact is that whether or not she “really agreed with everything I said”  

(And she HAS to agree with those things for this relationship to work out)

(Since like during my first trip  to Boston “all the messages kinda got mixed up”)

(Like for example my post about how she CAN’T have any male friends/acquaintances.)
(NOTE : and I still have not gotten a confirmation about that yet.) 

(If anything, that topic comes first)


2. So also I been thinking. 
“In the unlikely scenario this doesn’t work out with me and the ESTJ 14 Asian” 
(for whatever reason) 

I would need some kind of “closure” right?  

And my question is

“Could that closure be done via YouTube vids” 

Well i don’t know really, but like the thing about messaging via YouTube vids is that, it’s kind of hard to “tell the truth that way right?”. Well because you all know I’m sensitive and all. And if the “messages are too aggressive/jokes/not serious ” or anything I’ll just have assume it’s from my enemies.

And so I guess my point for the above is 

“How do you break bad news (if there is any)  via YouTube videos?”

You can’t right? Well because you all (all my 100% loyal family) 
know that I’m sensitive and sending that message via YouTube videos isn’t exactly “the best way to do it”. 
(And if you can, then figure out a way)
(After all I’m still waiting for my “confirmation” for my post 3 posts before this one (about how I don’t want the ESTJ 14 Asian to have ANY male friends and etc.......)

Anyhow I guess in the end I’ll need to have “somebody by my side” and if it works out with the ESTJ 14 Asian, then sure it can just be with her and only her.

But if it doesn’t workout........... then it has to be my therapist or my other friend. 
(I don’t think my dad’s the therapist type, since he’s a 152 right. )
(Or all 3 of them) 

But in that scenario i would want the ESTJ 14 Asian 
(gone for life) 
(well that’s IF the relationship doesn’t work out, but yeah I’m not jumping to conclusions now) 

3. Also, and more so about “the truth and all that” .

Let’s say, in the scenario that everything “DOES work out” I get in contact with her start talking with her watching movies and playing pc games everyday and etc............. 

In order for me to have a “peace of mind” I’d HAVE to see her phone screen in real time.

( just like how you’re all doing with my iPhone right now.)

And so yeah, and the thing is that 
“well I’m assuming” that the only reason the ESTJ 14 hasn’t contacted me yet is because like I said “she is nervous”.

And how this connects is that.

About my “friend” (ESTP) (not my therapist) that’s been helping me, he’s a just some badass savage right? 
And so i want to let him/all my 100% loyal family know that, IF there is ANY bad news (well in regards to the ESTJ 14 Asian that means that this relationship “won’t work out” have my “friend” contact me ASAP. Like call my phone or something lol)

And the reason for this is because, like I said eventually, when we all get in contact me and all my 100% loyal family. 
I AM and I WILL to get access to her phone screen the ESTJ 14 Asian 
(Well because that’s the ONLY way for me to have a peace of mind, as far as I know, unless any of my 100% loyal family have any other ideas (most likely won’t help)

And I’m sure all of my 100% loyal family can ALREADY see her phone screen in real time (the ESTJ 14).

And so the idea is

“IF You (all my 100% loyal family) already know beforehand that this relationship won’t work out, then just let me know right now and spare me the trouble of finding it out eventually” 
(when I see the ESTJ 14 Asians phone screen)

And since my friend “the ESTP” (not my therapist) is “a savage” and just doesn’t care, he’s not nervous or anything. Heck he prob still has my number that I gave him before, all he has to do is call me and I’d be like 

“Oh hey I remember you lol, let’s talk about what you did this morning or whatever” 

Or some random stuff. And then, of course get to that topic about the ESTJ 14 Asian 
(in whatever way is appropriate)

And so yeah that’s the idea. 

4. And also,

I want to let all my 100% loyal family know that.

Yeah, I did say that in like 2 posts before this one. 
That 
“I want to know the truth no matter what”  and that 
“I can handle the truth” 

And like I say those things, well because it’s true. It is a FACT that “I can handle the truth”. 

Although “the truth” (if it is bad) WILL hurt me emotionally a lot, that’s also true.
(And “a lot” is an “understatement” because like I said before the ESTJ 14 Asian means the world to me) 
(But anyhow, my point is 
“no matter the how bad it hurts, I can handle it and I KNOW I can”)

But I won’t die or anything LOL 
(trust me I can handle this) 

And like I always got my genius mastermind dad with me and my 2 other friends. And you’re all like “professional psychologists” 

And like I’m sure I can find a relationship that DOES work eventually 
(well with the help of all of my 100% loyal family) 
(and again if the relationship with the ESTJ 14 does not work out I want her gone for life)

Anyhow, I just wanted to post this. 
(I’m also still waiting for my confirmation, (about how I don’t want the ESTJ 14 Asian to have ANY male friend/acquaintances) 
(well besides the 3 of my 100% loyal family)
however way you wanna send the message)

To (all my 100% loyal family) 
Thanks for reading!
You should do the Mississippi queen from regular show.
Wasabi Ice Cream from Cars 2?
Whoa, you made marshmallows without mallow?! Weak. True homemade marshmallows contain actual mallow which you must forage for because it cannot be found in stores or markets.
About marshmallows, it's thought that they were invented around 2,000 b.c.e in Egypt and were reserved for gods and royalty. The modern version was made in France in the 19th century.
"Marshmallow stuff" you made is a basic Swiss Meringue
Damn, I really got to eat more Graham crackers ❌👊🥩
explain to me why Americans say Graham like Gram?
“It would be crazy to double carb”

It’s literally all carbs
Im fasting for ramadan and watching this video is hard
I mean... graham crackers should be made with graham flour...
Please make Dwight's Christmas Hog Maw from The Office Season 9 ep 9!!
Dammit, you made me want to eat an entire bag of chocolate filled marshmallows even though I don't even know if they exist

Binging with babish have you made a manwich from Futurama?
Mallow-mixture. then once cooked marsh- mellows. loving the vids
Babby. I humbly request that you make Double Glazed Apple Fritters from Regular Show. It would make my day!
My man really shaved his forearm for that little whisk editing trick. What a legend
Fun fact: pancakes were invented by Abraham Lincoln.
This has been a very confusing episode. Am I to believe that Americans eat bowls of melted marshmallows using biscuit spoons?
"Fun Fact, did you know gram crackers were made to stop masturbation?"

Me: wait, wtf
Make some of Tonio Trusardi's dishes from Jo Jo's bizarre adventure part 4. Just make sure you don't give them the agonising healing properties that they're known for. Also they're Italian.
If you're still taking suggestions...how about some of the dishes mentioned in The Good Place? The ones from The Good Plates, or Jason's Jalapeno Poppers, i'm sure you can find something if you look!
Hang on, does Babish’s friend is Vinny as in Bon Appetit Vinny?
I've been scrolling in the comments for a while now and I do love all the marshmallow puns, but surprised I have not seen at all that basically it's just called a marshmallow mixture.. O.o
Babish: i made marshmallows
me: you WHAT
I thought he was making a food from ted bundy but then I read the title again and it says teddy😧

Hey babish have you thought about trying to make the foods from Steven Universe? He has so many strangely creative foods it would be fun to see your take on them.

Man, you should really cook professionally if you don't already. Everything you make always looks delicious!
Billy, Josh, Pablo, Juan: Marshmallows names
I didn't notice that his forearm was only partly shaven until he did his 'Tiny whisk trick'..... Now I can't stop looking at it.....

Hi Babish can you make more ice cream stuff like the Triple gooberberry sunrise please😊

Chilli dogs and chocolate chip Sundae supreme: Sonic the hedgehog 
Glazed Mcguffins: Sam and Max

Surprised you didn't crush up some pretzels in a food processor (or just crush them profusely) and use that as the base in the second attempt, it would have stayed a little more true to form and given it that salty/sweet flavor profile from the original
all this talk of beating it

Your voice is amazing and smoothing

Graham crackers have such a weird history 😂
There's a very good children's show called Star vs. the Forces of Evil. In this show, there is an alternate world/dimension called Mewni. Their main crop, and entire way of life, is Corn. They have a corn mine. They have a sport called corn ball. Corn, corn, corn.

The point is, if you're ever super lazy and out of ideas, make some corn, and call it a Star vs. the Forces of Evil reference.
Did you steal Brad's Vinny?
make Mississippi queen from regular show.
Now, do you only entertain weddings that you know are "doomed", or are they doomed because you're involved?
the terms: "im on a diet" and "marshmallows" dont exactly go together.
How is Lindt "luxurious"? Lol they sell that stuff at the dollar store.
This man puts so much effort, and has so much determination for each creation he cooks. Really cool to watch!

Wait! You were supposed to crush the pretzels!
"Let's try something no one tries to do at home" so basically a majority of us who watch these videos, and never make any of these dishes 😂
I happen to love my marshmallows burnt too lol. I like a lot of foods burnt or very well done! Like chocolate chip cookies well done or naked chicken wings fried hard. I also prefer very dark chocolate to any other kinds of chocolate, 60% cocoa or more lol. I think it’s a specific type of palette in some people that prefers their food over cooked.
Edit: I forgot to mention that I also always pick out the the well done crackers or chips from snacks lol. I adore the extra toasty Cheez-It’s and Unique Extra Dark “Splits” pretzels! They are my top favorite snacks!
Did he say Propane? That’s very dangerous to be using indoors as it produces a Carbon monoxide...
Hate to disagree with you on the store bought marshmallows versus homemade- but homemade marshmallows are soooo much better!!!!!! And don’t take too much skill! Alton Brown has a recipe that I use religiously. I can’t even tell you the last time I bought a bag of marshmallows at the store.
jeez that impression was flawless haha
Are we not going to talk about the swath of hair missing around your whisk tattoo? Did it never grow back from back when you first got it? Or did you shave it for the magic trick?

Did you learn how to make the brûlée on skillshare Babish?

It would be crazy to double carb? Marshmallows and Hershey’s chocolate are like pure sugar lmao. You’re already triple carbed up my man.
so if there's a story behind the 'doomed weddings,' we get to hear it, right?
Okay but Burnt Marshmallows just tastes infinitely better especially with Dark Chocolate
Hey Babish, can you do a Basics w Babish episode on burritos? I was wondering how exactly a good burrito can be made with different meat choices and sauces. Thanks!

I'm someone that makes my own graham crackers and marshmallows. They are both better homemade. The store bought marshmallows taste like foam..
Burnt marshmallows are the way to go. The best way is to set the marshmallow on fire, then let it burn itself out. Guess who gets the first smore at the bonfire? Not the person rotating for 5 minutes.
Burnt marshmallow is the best kind of marshmallow
His face at 2:39 .. yeah kinda scared me for a sec

Hey, Babish. Can you do Papyrus' spaghetti from Undertale?

Make mochi please
I love making marshmallows. I disagree, tho and think they are vastly superior to store bought. Also, cold brew marshmallows. Use cold brew coffee instead of water to moisten your gelatin. And speaking of gelatin I'm attempting to master vegan marshmallows. I already tried one batch, which failed. So I'm using another method and trying again in a few days.
I like how you say marshmallow
this guy will literally advertise anything for money lmao, i love it!!!

I don't know about corn sirup marshmallows but French homemade ones with (and its VERY important) egg whites have a completly different taste, I can only recommend it to you

Your grahams are missing so much molasses... You made some kind of honey cinnamon cracker instead.
Holy God I’m going to die XDDDDDDDDDDD
Omg- I heard he had a girlfriend who broke up with him. Who could break up with a guy who can make marshmallows from scratch? And why though? If it were me he could wake me up drenching me in flour and trying to make me into a burrito during a cooking night terror dream/sleepwalking episode - and we could work through it lmfaoooo.

Kevin’s creme brûlée from the office
LOL Babish has that meta humor, sometimes!

@2:03 he States that Graham crackers were invented by Sylvester Graham to combat masterbation... Then Babish immediately says he's gonna BEAT the ingredients into another!

I shout BRAVO, paired with the gesture in which you extend the fingers of one hand, touching thr tips... Then bringing that hand up to your face, motion as if you are kissing the tips of your fingers... Usually involving a kissing sound, and immediately opening your fingers after the kissing gesture.... A very common gesture after enjoying fine dining/flavors etc.... In this case I'm enjoying a fine adult dad joke

(Sidenote... Without doing any research, I'm willing to bet that Babish's claim about Graham is likely true...
as I know that the Quaker's Dr. Kellogg concocted bran cereal, among other bland foods,
... Believing that spices are condusive to immoral thoughts, while eating bland will push you away from temptation {SPECIFICALLY MASTERBATION!}, and help you live a Godly/bland life! lololol)

Hey Babish, I know you are probably never gonna end up seeing this but I'm 17 and I sense that I have a passion for cooking, despite never really cooking anything other than pasta, but I know its there. My kitchen is not very fancy so trying out the things you do is pretty tough and intimidating. I really want to take some cooking classes but I seem to be in that purgatory where all the kids my age with a passion already know how to do the basics and then some. Therefore I stray away from those courses out of intimidation. I was wondering if you had any suggestions for easy dishes that don't require much equipment to make. Thanks.

Marshmallow started as a delivery method for a herbal medicine named marshmallow. Basically the idea is the herb gets covered in sugar so it tastes nice. At some point the herbal mallow was taken out of the confection and now "marshmallows" are just empty postboxes.

Marshmelldough
Here's some actual facts about marshmallow: Marshmallows were originally made from Mallow root, a cousin of sarsparilla found in marshes(Hence the name of the confection) that was filled with sticky mucilage(think of the slime in Okra) that was widely used in natural medicines. To make it into the familiar candies you would have to boil the root to extract the mucilage, clarify and purify the extract and then whip the resulting goo with sugar.

Though it doesn't work for this type of recipe, if you want a superior marshamallow rather than a replication of store-bought ones, make Dominque Ansel's soft and fluffy marshmallows (made with egg whites). They are superior for eating as regular marshmallows, but they will dissolve a bit too fast for s'mores. They are lighter, less sweet, and just a nicer texture.

My brother as a mini goldendoodle. His name is Teddy. He is an adorable idiot. And I'm french speaking. Brulée means burned. My heart skipped a beat when I saw your video lol.
Today we're taking a look at the Teddy Brûlée, thanks to our sponsor Skillshare, because whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

Someone called me and that's what I heard.
Yes! Burnt marshmallows are so good!

Fun fact: Marshmallows were originally made in ancient Egypt out of a pulverized plant mixed with honey, and was used by royalty as a medicine. Modern marshmallows were first made in France by adding meringue to it. The plant is no longer used but the recipe's otherwise never really changed since then.
This guy should really open a restaurant about TV and Video game foods, it would honestly be a hit!

Graham crackers and pretzels are pretty different from one another on the spectrum of crunchy things that you only eat when you can't find anything better.
Did you just cook not a burger from Bob's Burgers?
Do the Piss Tea from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind
"in that spirit we beat the ingredients together" lost it there
I watch these knowing damn well I will never make them
What makes Teddy Brulee is using the PRETZELS, and I guess fire, but Pretzels are different then a normal smore taste.

Thank you for a proper graham cracker recipe 😭 fellow Europeans with American pallets will know what I’m talking about
6:57 me too
I have an idea, call the marshmallow batter, marshmallow
Grahamites . . . that was a thing. Aspirants to maximum boredom. Wow. Wow
When you mentioned Sylvester Graham I got flashbacks to this apush project I did over the Reform movement, with him specifically within health. Graham was all about celibacy and refused to have sex with his wife. He denounced alcohol and spicy foods, and ate on a vegetarian diet. He loved whole wheat bread over anything, and our entire slogan for the project was “let’s get this bread”

Clever, I know.
You’re the best Babish!!
No babish, its marshmello goo
Mmm thank you for the chocolate upgrade. 

I have an interesting hunt to find graham crackers made with wheat germ and marshmallows made with marshmallow root. My understanding this is the traditional forms. Has anyone made or come across such back-in-the-day creations?
TCHA NOICE
You should make Tubby Custard!
Mellow dough
Thank you Mr Babish for using sweet sweet propane. I salut you sir.
You should make something from Chowder.  For instance, blurple nurples.
Fun fact: graham crackers aren’t supposed to be sweet, as originally made; they were supposed to be bland.
Lmao do people not know that about gramcrackers?
No wonder why I can't get that thing up after eating smores
Did you just tiny whisk chocolate bars?
5:23 Oh my god... is that VINCENZO?
I thought he would say he lear how to make marshmallow from Claire of Bon Appetite
That was a hell of an impression. 5 stars
I finally heard the NY accent when he said water
5:52 I would call that thing as "Vaahtokarkkitaikina"
Gross but good cooking lessons as usual.
I feel like the 2:10 joke is severely under noticed
A fellow burnt mallow monster like me!!!
You can mix your flavors up on the marshmallows too. Any extract you can find in the flavor section can be made into a marshmallow. There is a butter and nut flavor extract that makes really good marshmallows to toast. I make a bunch of different types most years for the holidays. They're good hot chocolate and coffee add ins.
Insure that beard
"I`m on a diet, so I can`t even taste the food I spend hours to make." Well, my diet prevents me from watching this waste of time.

2:04 ok...
I know it's a smores dip... but where's the pretzels? gasp home made pretzel bites with that smores dip... just thought of it while typing.
I’ve always called the mixture mash mellow fluff
you should do a daily grace special!
2:03
Excerpt from Wikipedia: "The graham cracker was inspired by the preaching of Sylvester Graham, who was a part of and strongly influenced by the 19th-century temperance movement; Graham believed that a vegetarian diet anchored by home-made whole grain bread, made from wheat coarsely ground at home, as part of a lifestyle that involved minimizing pleasure and stimulation of all kinds, was how God intended people to live and that following this natural law would keep people healthy. His preaching was taken up widely in the US in the midst of the 1829–51 cholera pandemic.  His followers, Grahamites, formed one of the first vegetarian movements in the US, and graham flour, graham crackers, and graham bread were created for them and marketed to them; Graham neither invented nor profited from these products."


I'm nothing short of amazed. Also that little "It's true" at  is wonderful

0:35 "But for the literal recreation, we gonna stick with [storebought marshmallows]."
>Proceeds to break the chocolate sqaures down into chocolate rectangles
>Proceeds to not crush the pretzel sticks
>Uses a smaller flame, resulting in burnt marshmallows'

EDIT: Oh, and both reinterpretations proceed to  as well.

Graham crackers were invented by religious fundamentalists. Very different back then. And I think. No wasn't marshmallow. That was breakfast cereal.

At least you're not one of those monsters that likes their marshmallows duck-shaped and covered in sawdust that was artificially sweetened to hide the strong undertone of shame...but you'd probably burn those all the same, eh?
Marshmallow Goo? that sounds good as a name..... It sounds like a name for marshmello but like a rip-off version that you can get to a kids birthday party
Who's coming to Italy with me? Do they have butter burgers in Italy? No? Alright I guess we can still go.

Churned heavy cream separates into butter and buttermilk, not whey. Whey is what remains after milk curdles during cheesemaking.


Whey looks borderline transparent and is very watery. Buttermilk is actually thicker than whole milk. Very different things. (Whey : Milk as Buttermilk : Heavy Cream, which is why it's much thicker than whey, and doesn't have the crazy protein powder abilities of whey)

>win a trip in Italy

There's a place in my town called old Chicago they have a burger called a hangover burger similar concept absolutely delicious
Dude I'd have smothered both versions in creamy garlic butter with caramelized onions, one slice Swiss cheese with one slice Munster cheese, candied jalapeno slices, and I would have stayed with the massive ass 18 ounce patty. Skip the fries unless you've been starving for a whole twelve hours or if you're hung over from the previous night.
They should have these at universal studios
Donated, also prayed to God offering to give up bourbon forever in exchange for winning, so uh..pretty optimistic.

I'm from WIsconsin and when we really try to make butter burgers, abeit, I dont in my house often, but we go all out. We cook the onions in the butter, we add butter into the skillet and baste the burgers as if it were a steak and then we spread butter on the buns before toasting them. All while drinking a beer and snacking on cheese curds. Also a true Wisconsinite doesn't use American cheese. Wisconsin Cheddar all the way! Absolutely love your channel keep up the good work!

"She Looks Like Fun", if you know you know
I've been to Solly's many times and it's really just a mediocre diner burger with an absurd amount of butter on it. There are far better burger places.
In a small way you’ve become a role model to me about how to achieve and go after your dreams. You do things to the best of your ability and are meticulous with your details, methods, and insane work ethic. More than the food watching you rise is just inspiring and I’m so happy you’ve found this success. Keep ok rocking!
I like your camera frame rate. Every drop of grease looks like a spark.
So many unnecessary steps... American don’t know what is cooking.

Don't salt the meat when preparing. Do it immediately before cooking, thus making the meat more juicy.
Is the guide and everything else paid or we have to pay for the fun stuff? Will we go coach/ economic, business, or first class to Italy? Will we only see you one time or everyday? If one time then why?
Great video. You have a ton of personality man.

Me:well I’m 14 and I’m pretty my parents would be pretty suspicious of this “babish guy” as my parents would say
I REALLY miss these "do it better" episodes.
As a man from Wisconsin i tell you what, the biggest thing we say is "Hey look the temperature is gonna be above 60! So grateful it's the middle of May." Because winter this year was from middle of December to middle of April. Thanks Wisconsin.

Unless you eat a butter burger from a Wisconsin culvers. You have not lived.

watching you cook while fasting is the most challenging thing of all time lol
A wisconsinite here, you forgot frozen custard, a beer, and cheese curds.
I'm not sure if we can do like a request or something. But if we can I was wondering if you could make the clementine cake from the secret life of Walter Mitty. It's not super exotic but still cool
So no one is going to talk about the "flame recognizing flame" comment? 🌈👀
This man just steamed his hams
Make microwave wings from regular show
As a proud Wisconsinite,  I approve your choice in using the esteemed Butter Burger as your Adaptation of choice. However, the fact that you chose to use "Yellow American" as your 'cheese' of choice has caused the council to ban you from ever entering our fine state again. and if you do not comply, I got a shed up north where you will be placed in and forbidden to leave. have a great day. 
-Literally everyone from Wisconsin.
5:06 I’m guessing that means working off the about 1000 calories you both ate from just a few bites.

Love you bab
Niga
Hey you sexy beast! I LOVE 💕 your channel, voice, hands...oops I’m distracted. Yeah I have a crush. I was hoping you could do a Keto dish or dishes.

A shout out would make me smile with a side happy tears of joy! 🥺Please🔥🌈🌷🤩🥰❤️💋🥰🤩 🎁❤️🧡💛💚💙- Laura T.

Can you link the pepper mill? Mine just broke and I want a good one!
I hope whoever wins the trip to Italy really benefits from it.

Dude, I hope I win the trip with you. I need to go back to Italy so bad. And to be with Babish, my life would be complete
Next month will be 13 years since I became a vegetarian. I quit cold turkey (pun intended) and never once knowingly cheated on my chosen dietary restrictions.

I would give it all up if I won this contest.
You should totally make volcano wings (or something like that) they are very hot wings from regular show

It's not the same...if you don't eat your creations, it's not the same, Babish.
Babish..... Do you have your own utensil line coming out? I may have missed the memo, but I saw a wooden spoon with your glorious beard etched into it... Surely i'm not the only one who saw that....

0:49 The Shire is a region of J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth, described in The Lord of the Rings and other works. The Shire refers to an area settled exclusively by Hobbits and largely removed from the goings-on in the rest of Middle-earth. It is located in the northwest of the continent, in the large region of Eriador and the Kingdom of Arnor.

The cheese will run from you!
A tip for scooping cheese with mini breads or crackers is to use two!! Use one to scoop and the other to trap the cheese and you got a lil croque monsieur.

Thank you so so much for this series. I'm a college student who's not really into cooking, but making some of the basics (for survival) is making me believe I can actually cook
Can your next "Basics" video be cream-based soups? (potato soup, clam chowder, lobster bisque, cream of mushroom, creamy veggie soup, brocolli & cheddar soup, philly cheese steak soup)
To be honest this was so delicious and also he was delicious too 👀
Is it still called a dip if you drink it like a smoothie?
Asking for a friend.

Southern style pimento cheese has curds and is similar in texture to cottage cheese.
I reckon that is where the “caviar of the South” nickname originates.
Please, PLEEEASE, do the "crab a la pepsi maximum" from Killian experience

Rest of the world: dips contain many things

My friends: why
Me, chugging the rest of the bottle: what?
Oooh Such a brilliant episode after the Grilled cheese deluxe when you are stuffed with 30 types of cheeses in your fridge ♥️😂

*cheese ball is bare*
Bacon: its free real estate

I love all your recipes Babish. Although, I was never able to understand all the fuss about artichoke and I don't think I ever will. I personally hate it SO MUCH, I can barely even stand the smell. 


Anyways, keep up the great content (:

Perfect timing for Cinco de mayo thanks babs
How did you not include a single dip that wasn’t at least 50% cheese?
Can somebody please tell me what the music is from 5:41 onwards? I keep listening to it.
I love your channel and I recently went vegan. I’m not condemning the meat content but I’d love to see a basics episode ft. Something vegan! Love the show - keep it up 😊
Do uses of artichokes. They never get enough love.
The irony of "what's-the-shire" sauce being closer to the actual pronounciation of worcestershire than anything else you've managed. Bravo, Babish. Bravo.
In America are dips just solely melted cheese?
Ooh Babish with the clutch video before my party!!! I will try these!!!! 😍

Opulence! You own everything!!!!
When life gives you cheeses, just fondue it bruh.

Bro do chicken in the corn
I gotta day I love your videos, ever since the first one. I can tell you don’t just like being a YouTuber, you love it. The videos you make put me in a trance, not just because they are satisfying to all five senses, but because I can see the passion in them as well. Keep on doing what you’re doing, man.
wow I never realized what a fucked up work 'softened' was until I heard somebody pronounce it deliberately and correctly.
I'm never sure if it's the food, the voice, or  Babish just being unacceptabley handsome, but I fall in love again with every one of these videos. 
It's the food. I'm definitely a cheese fiend.
I feel like I'm at a smorgasbord and all you're serving me is cheese dip
It’s the caviar of the south because that’s the fanciest thing in culinary we have
Love your videos! You should do one based on Ed’s Sauce from Good Burger! 🍔
I'll have two number 9s, number 9 large, number 6 with extra dip, number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese and a large soda.
I love the Whatstheshire sauce and will now call it that going forward.  It's more fun
A queso dip is more than just melting a 50/50 blend in the oven. Where is the spicing and jalapeño, low key disappointed here.
Can you do the grilled Frank from it’s always sunny
can you make your favorite food on this channel? i want too know what kind've food you like and how you make it :D
You got any dips that don't involve cheese? ._.

Good bye diet.

You should recreate the foods from Cowboy Bebop!
Speaking of cheese... how about making the Calzone from that one We Bare Bears episode
Using "what's the shire" sauce from now on.
I would love to see a Basics video featuring more about Artichokes.
Andrew, your cheese consumption levels are off the charts. We all love you and are worried sick. You have a problem, enough is enough.
Could you do basics with babish: college edition or basics with babish on a budget
You should make krusty Crab pizza
that intro song still sounds cut weird to me. I love cheese tho, so you are forgiven for now.
WHY do I click on these videos when I know I'm temporarily broke and can't afford all the cool ingredients Babish uses? What's wrong with meeee?!

as someone who lives in Worcester, less than half mile from the Lea & Perrin's building, I approve of 'What's-the-shire Sauce' :)
Honestly I love basics with babish bc it never changed the original intro please keep it og intro
Babish. for heating the spinach and artichoke hearts you should have used the bacon grease from cooking the bacon instead of olive oil. also, you could grease the pot with some more just for more flavor
I was waiting for you to drink those dips. You disappoint me Andrew.
Babish I has a question. 

does the beer have to be Mexican. 

chur.
Johnny sins😍😍
ngl the intro music for this show is honestly my favourite of any show eon youtube

Best of luck cleaning that cast iron.

Cooking with banish: today we are making cheese dip

Highly disagree, although I love spinach artichoke dip, buffalo chicken dip is definitely the “daddy” of all dips😂💜 but still love all the dips in the episode
Ah good ol "For the Shire" sauce.
So what's with bell peppers & beef from cowboy bepop for a future video? 🤔

Make Gloria's salsa from modern family
As a massive fan of Spinach & Artichoke dip, this is one I will have to make and try :D Looks amazing (as do all the others)
Could you make something from New Girl? Like Nick’s sauce?
It doesn't get any more basic than Jarlsberg dip. Grated Jarlsberg cheese, mayo and shallot or red onion. The amounts are totally up to you, I like more mayo, some people like more onion... a touch of garlic powder would be nice. Let it sit for at least an hour and serve chilled or bake/microwave to melt it. 
Personally I like to use it as the filling for a grilled cheese sandwich.
i'm lactose intolerant what i am doing

Hey, can you buy me a ticket to New York please?
Incredible cheeseball that everyone raves about:

2 packages cream cheese
8 ounces shredded cheddar
1/2 cup minced onion
2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
very finely chopped walnuts or pecans to coat


Make it the night before so it has at least 8 hours to chill and firm up, then coat in nuts shortly before serving.  It's so easy yet people will think you're a great cook.
Love you Babby! ❤️❤️

You should try to make an episode about european bread. Gives you more variety for sandwich making, and its generally better (and healthier) than white bread.
Not with frozen spinach though, it has such a difference in flavor.
I’m a bit of a cheese head; you got basics but come on babish. Where’s the onion, garlic, pepper infused milk?  Why you no add meats or peppers?

Think you kinda missed the mark
this is the best ever cheese dip recipe. Its a Torchys Tacos Queso copycat recipe.

16 oz fire roasted salsa
4 oz green chiles
32 oz velveeta
⅓ c cream


Mix together over medium flame until melted and hot.

Stir continuously.

Top with guacamole, cilantro, crumbled or shredded queso fresco and Torchy's Diablo sauce.

If you don't have access to Torchy's sauce, add your favorite hot sauce.

Normally you put the guacamole in the middle and then pour the cheese sauce over it.

Then top with the queso fresco and cilantro.
Now I'm so fricken hungry...dang you babish!

Hey Babish sir, I have a recipe that I theorised but I don't have the money or the available ingredients to try. Can you tell me if it is plausible? 
So you have your basic cheesecake right? (Crust made from oreos)  
Then you put in a layer of marshmallows and bake it so that the marshmallows melt in a layer on top of the cheesecake 
Then you put in a layer of melted chocolate (It has to harden when chilled) and then another layer of Maltesers  (chocolate covered malted milk balls) and refrigerate for idk how much time lol 
Anyway, I only theorised this recipe but is it plausible?
These look seriously yummy!
I'd add the pimentos to the cheeseball last, after the cheese is blended, so you still have pieces.

Hey Babbi! Long time watcher, first time commenter here. Actually I have a friend who looks just like you, sometimes I pretend that he IS you, then am a bit disappointed when reality strikes and I have just my friend Taylor sitting beside me. Great guy though, and he is working in his cooking skills, mainly for tinder dates. 

Question: what is your favourite non stick pan. And do you have any tips to make them last longer. Recently I've been very disappointed with "Gotham Steel". It looked so great on the infomercial.

TIME TO DELIVER A CHEESE BALL
I just gotta say that I can never skip Babish’s intro, it just to catchy
You should try to make some of Bobby June’s recipes off of GTA 5
Bro you should've done Choriqueso , which is basically chorizo + queso oaxaca or a cheese that melts nicely (could be monterrey jack, but oaxaca isn't very salty and it balances very well with the chorizo), you can add sliced raw jalapeño or chile verde, and also mushrooms (portobello). Literally just throw that in a pot, let it melt and cook for a bit and you can have an amazing dip. You can also make quesadillas or tacos out of it.
Did you mean:Queso
In Texas, I don't think I've ever seen queso fundito on the menu. Chili con queso is much more common here. Queso Flameado is also an option, which is melted Monterrey Jack with meat like chorizo or fajitas.
well im lactose intolerant, so this should be fun
Now I want cheese dip
I guess you could say that these are fonduementals to cheese dips.
It took me a while to learn how to make cheeses sauce...i used to think you just melted cheese..... .. ..no🍕
This is very useful to me because I'm in France and have never had those amazing looking nachos with cheese and jalapeños and all kinds of other stuff on them. I've also never found nacho cheese do now I may just be able to make my own absolutely unhealthy abomination :)

Cheese lives matter
Like cheese, but not the milk kind
I was hoping for advice on creamier nacho cheese-style dip.  Every time  I make it homemade, it ends up being way too gritty, instead of that smooth texture that makes for dips that can last longer than 15 minutes.
Im noticing pornbots flooding replies
I can't stop binge watching Babish

Now, remember not to double dip with communal chips.
If you think you might have double dippers in your midst when you whip up that dip tape a pair of double-dipping scissors with good grip to the lips so they won't slip in the bacteria drenched tips of the chips can be snipped real quick. And add a thick rip resistant drip strip so you don't end with a dip slick on your thick picnic stick, which shouldn't be lying around anyway. It's a picnic stick, not a cupboard stick. For a truly bacteria-free chip shift use tweezers to swiftly dip, lift and stick without flicking the lips. SIIIICK!

Not sure where you field your suggestions but here goes. Have you considered doing a Basics video on plating? It’s totally something you could intuit through the scores of cooking media but it would be great to have more method to the madness.
For spinach artichoke dip you have to try it with gruyere and parm. I know mozz and romano are tasty, but the Swiss make a damn fine cheese that I think goes great with spinach and artichoke.

Edit: Oh and feta is also a phenomenal option. Really it's hard to fuck up spinach artichoke dip by picking the wrong cheese, especially if you hedge your bets with a recipe that uses cream cheese to mitigate any texture issues from harder cheeses.
Where’s the Mexican queso? The kind that’s smooth and thin, not that thick stringy stuff! Everything else looks amazing though!
Yummm!!

Here's a great one for ya, and basically foolproof:
Fontina cheese, cubed
quarter cup olive oil
Six (yes, six) sliced garlic cloves
rosemary
thyme
black pepper
coarse sea salt

Put the cheese in a broiler pan, drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle with the herbs, garlic, salt, and pepper, then put it under the broiler until everything is all nice and crusty and bubbly. Serve with tiny baguette toasts and hardy dippable veggies (and a fun dry white wine). Recipe courtesy of Ina Garten.

That’s not pimento cheese. That’s a cheese ball. Pimento cheese has pimentos and is made with shredded cheese. Speaking as a Southerner.

Still delicious though, that cheese ball.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm Babish......chicken buffalo dip ❓❓❓
I never realized Pimento Cheese was a southern thing. Its everywhere here. Also I never knew Pimento was anything but a cheese. The more you know. Thanks Babish for teaching me something about my own culture that I never would have realized.

Queso fundido is the best queso
Did Babish get a new tattoo on  his right arm of Thor's hammer axe thingie, or is that just me???
Go commit banana
SODIUM CITRAAAAAAAATTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEE
I make beer cheese in my stomach all the time 👌
what’s the shire sauce
a disturbing lack of evaporated milk. Babish clearly doesnt read the food lab
Hey Babish! I was kinda wondering if there was any chance that you may want to work with recipes for us unlucky individuals who live the taste of cheese, but really shouldn't eat (curse you, lack of enzymes!). It would be really interesting to see you work with that, though also there's been a lot of cheese centered videos recently and they all look good. Which makes me sad, haha
not for nothing, but pimento cheese is shredded cheese with all the other shit. this is way too fancy for a redneck.
When I dip, you dip, we dip....
a little dash of what’s the shire sauce
Make us some versions of salsa!
Anybody know what they call Tex-Mex style queso dip outside the southwest? I would think from the texture that it's made from a roux, and it seems to include peppers and maybe pico? Closest I can find is a recipe for the velveeta+salsa dip thing but it is nowhere near the same.
Can someone please tell me the name of the cooking vessel used for the spinach and artichoke dip? It looks really nice and I want one so bad.
You ate over the pan.  Gross.
Made a prison burrito
What about Fondue?
Am I the only one who knows that is in fact not pimento cheese?
Its free real-estate
Dairy cheese is loaded with pus, cholesterol, casomorphin, blood, scat, and growth hormones. Why would you consume that, or consider it nutritious? It's not.
I wonder if you tried all the cheese and melted into one.
I know it’s not a movie/tv show reference but pennyroyal tea (from Nirvana)?
Those nacho cheese dips that you find on the stores are just any molten cheese. It doesn't solidify at room temperature because of sodium citrate - a citrusy tasting salt which breaks down proteins in cheese and acts as emulsifier/stabilizer. I've never tried myself, because sodium citrate isn't something you buy at the spices section, but I would really would like to see someone trying this.
I like everything babish
All I gotta say is... Mmmm cheeese
Otherwise know as babish showing off all his cute baking dishes
Shockingly absent: Tiny Whisk.
but ... who cares
Yum
I liked it when Daddy said “Daddy.”
Delicious
I'm not lactose-intolerant. Sometimes, when I'm taking in a bunch of dairy, I do wonder if I have a bit of a sensitivity. But anyway, this video made my stomach hurt and I want to make all of these sweet babies right now.
Hey do chocolate pie from the help
cant wait till 6.9 mill
How many times did you accidentally cut your hand while grating all the cheese?
Lol the dry humor
Yes
This queso is non texmex approved. Queso does not get hard again
This only works with american cheese. If you want use any other type of cheese needs a roux. Because otherwise the cheese and the beer wont melt together at all. Something about how american cheese is made makes it melt differently. Good luck
Please recreate Gordon Ramsey’s perfect burger, and make it better? And then make your perfect burger!
I would just eat the whole block of cheese because I have no self control cx
Babish said “Modelo time”
It’s Modelo time ;)
What is that watch called
Make rebetzles!
Any chance you could do something on cooking for someone with severe food intolerances?  I've got a friend on the low FODMAP diet and it's almost impossible outside of a steak seasoned with salt and pepper, which is ok, but not that great all the time.
Hope to see a Fondue episode in the future.
You NEED to watch "Food Wars" anime or "Shokugeki no Soma". It is absolutely jam-packed with awesome recipes and cooking tricks. You need to try to cook some.
Why is that toast so cute
1:37 America on a plate
Wish tinywhisk could taste some cheese
2:18 what time is it?
What’s the shire sauce
Let’s play a game:

Take a shot every time Babish says “cheese”

I dare you
1:50 you would be surprised
THE. DADDY. OF. ALL. DIPS.
Where can you get that bowl for the last dish?
Queso in my family has always meant velveeta, rotel and spicy sausage. I usually hate velveeta (or any kind of American ‘cheese product’) but that actually makes a really good, really simple queso... and I think my parents found the recipe on the back of the velveeta package
I can not eat cheese without projectile vomitting over half of germany, but still my mouth waters just watching this episode. That should say enough about Daddy Babish.
Unfortunately, this is one of the more disappointing episodes of Babish for me. It lacked substance to the episode...
Q: How to make a cheese ball? A: Ball some cheese
Q: How to make beer cheese? A: Melt cheese in beer
Q: How to make a cheese dip? A: Melt cheese in cast iron


The spinach artichoke dip showed some promise, but he followed it up with "you can doctor it however you want" and this is basics so that's it. Kind of a cop out. I know this is basics, but you don't think people are interested in how to keep their queso fundido from solidifying in 15 minutes so that the people who miss that crucial window aren't SOL? Some pro tips are what keep me interested in the channel, but there was nothing here.


To top it off, this 6 minute video consisted of over a minute of Babish just mentioning and promoting his sponsor. That's the biggest disappointment for me really... seems like this video was only crafted to deliver that sponsor message. It had the most detail out of anything he presented.
Pleeeease use nutmeg with spinach....
At least  he has stopped saying that his website is "all new" after all this time.
k but why did tasty post almost the vid today too
I normally enjoy your videos...and they all look pretty solid, but I have to say, the beer cheese dip is far from fool-proof.

I'm a pretty good cook, but I ended up with a curdled mess that was too much on the runny side. Maybe you needed to provide more/better explanation? At any rate, I wasted 2 pounds of cheese and a beer...so there's that.


I know you probably won't even READ this post Babish, because big Youtubers almost never read the comments on their vids...but to the people reading this, don't fuck around. There is nothing wrong with a tried and true approach to making beer cheese with a roux. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Chile con queso? Smh.
Why the beer ...
CHEDDAR
IS
NOT
YELLOW

Also stop pronouncing "shire" wrong
Hmm what about the nasty patty from spongebob
Those tortilla chips are trash Babish
that first one is the most american thing ive ever seen
I still really want to know where he bought the baby whisk. I need one, or maybe five...
For the spinach artichoke dip it's even better if you take a round sourdough bread loaf, cut out the center, put the dip in the hole and bake it.
The tiny toast is so cute! I wanna eat it
YumYUM!
Only Babish knows how to make a cheesy video.
Do the cake from Minecraft!
Modelo, nice
Does it feel like he’s talking faster than normal? I’m playing it on regular speed
Kinda disappointed in this "queso"
These recipes are so easy an idiot can understand them, and that appeals to me for some reason. :)
You mean a chip dip to dip the tip of the chip in the dip right?
I’m not at all a fan of cheese but whenever I see it I just get really hungry.
Dheese Cips
I love you Babish. Truthfully, without your content, life would be less fun &  although I know when you say these things, you're being sarcastic, but you always happen to come up with the most outrageous scenarios possible to address having something on hand lmaoo. "So what do you do if you have 4 pounds of white cheddar?" 💀 The chances of that occurring are as rare as if you were making a jumbo charcuterie board and everyone canceled last minute. If you were making a relatively large amount of fondue that you decided not to make. If you are a chef and accidentally ordered an additional 4 pounds of cheese or you overestimated for inventory and now you have extra. I can go on, but I mean, does any one really have 4 pounds of cheese on them ? 😭😂 at least if they did, they'd laugh at it the same way we all did and be like "hey what are the odds? I really do just have 4 pounds of cheese on me"
Did this man jusy say sofTened?
From North Carolina, the home of pimento cheese, I've never heard it referred to as the caviar of the South. Maybe those garbage eating troglodytes in SC call it that, but I doubt they even know what caviar is.
“I’m thinking we forgot one step, though. It’s… it’s… something, um... Oh, we have to melt the cheese.” Way to go on being all nonchalant with that remark. That was pretty cheesy.… And cool! 😉😎
For worstechersire  or whatever it is you can call it wuster, that’s what the English call it
Where's my white trash Velveeta and salsa dip? C'mon, man, that is the basic of basic cheese dips.
Basics with babish sandwiches?
I can’t be the only one who skipped right past the spinach and artichoke dip
Babish baby(Joey from friends voice) why no asiago
You know, I heard that when Babish eats something off camera, he doesn't actually eat it. He just feeds it to his beard.
Can you like my comment Babish
I have never been so aroused
Bets on how many times I burn my mouth trying to make these?
So much cheese. Babish is gonna have heart failure in two more episodes.
Ayy, It's Modelo time!
dont forget about the white cheese dip they have at mexican restaurants
I dont even know how to cook i’m jus hungry
Can you show us how to make chutney with mangoes?  Mangoes are pricey and when ya clean one up, there is little sweet mush to work with after skinning and removing the pit.  There must be an easier way.  Also, cheese making is of keen interest.  No one showing us peeps how to make all the cheeses, everyone showing how to make mozzarella, tho.
Chese deps
Hoes.
Hungry
Babish aren't you lactose intolerant?
my mom used to make spinach and artichoke bread, pretty much spinach and artichoke dip stuffed into a fat baguette
nice thanks
I want to make that beer cheese like right now, maybe make some Mac and cheese with it
Why do you sound so sad in this video
If you had added the mayo to the pimento cheese it would make a great sandwich spread or burger topping, though I and several people I know would gladly just eat it straight
Take sum cheese shove it in a Mike and the bakedabopa
The theme song cuts off weird at the start
Why am I watching this!? I'm only making myself more Hungry
Why is Babish so cool?
Great video 💗
Can you do Rachel’s Traditional English Trifle from Friends Season 6 Episode 9?
Little disappointed I didn’t see my east coast pride that is Chicken Dip
We got pizza kits, like pre-rolled dough etc, and my brother for once wanted to help make the pizza, while I do it usually. 5 minutes in and he ignores my tips of NOT rolling the sides over. After that I leave and 10 minutes later I come back and he fucked everything up, and when I call him out my mother says I have to shut up. Now I am pissed off asf.
I will move into your kitchen and sacrifice myself as your testeater. I only need a small blanket in a dark corner. And I eat almost everything. Well scratch the almost if you cook.... Sooo how about it?
Hey “BABBY”! I just finished watching every episode of it’s alive with Brad because he was in one of your episodes! Anyways, I recently found out that Vincento is now on your team? Congrats! He did an awesome job for Brad and I’m sure will do the same for you!
What a cheesy episode. It all looks delicious.
I really appreciate that you aren't a cilantro eating savage. The stuff is absolutely disgusting and ruins anything it touches and too many chefs on YouTube just add it to shit without even mentioning that it will make whatever you are cooking taste like metallic dish soap. When I worked at taco bell back in the day I always made sure to tell customers (the few times I worked register) that the Pico has cilantro in it just to warn them.
Everyone’s going to get to know each other in the pot
Babish, why Mexican beer? Is there something in it that adds a different flavor as opposed to another type of lager or ale?
I was just looking at cheese dips in the store and went "hmmm... I bet I could make better cheese dips made with less crap" and hey, look!
You the man babish! But seriously... it’s pronounced “wuster-sha sauce”
hearing babish say daddy is strange.
Do churros
Did you just ruin beer cheese with RAW ONIONS? No seriously, why? Sautee that next time!
You should do a basics in meal prep
This guy is the unbox therapy of food.
Isnt cheese dip just a rous with cheese and milk added?
What’s the shire?
hey, na
If you want another terrible for you but strangely  tasty  cheese dip try this 
2 cans of chili (no beans) ( it needs to be canned or  really  cooked down so it doesn't get watery you want some kind of canned chili that gelled in the can.)
2 blocks of cream cheese
two bags of low moisture mozz ( maybe 4 cups)
And a casserole pan ( preferably an oval one)


Put the cream cheese on the bottom and smooth it out . Then do the same with the chili, And top with the mozz, 
Bake at 325-350F  until the  mozz turns golden brown.
Yes i know it  sounds terrible and maybe a little disgusting but if your willing to try it  don't go too fancy , outside of  you  know the name brand cream cheese. It is suppose to look like garbage but its one of those So bad its good things. Oh and serve with tortilla chips
Be sure you eat plenty of fiber after trying all this cheese to prevent constipation
“Daddy of all dips”
In a related note, have you ever have bread cheese? This stuff is pretty pricy, but man it is the best cheese Ive eaten by itself
I’m disappointed he didn’t say “it’s modelo time” .
someone please tell me what watch that is!
If I found that I had a 4lb block of Cheddar, what would I do with it? Make myself sick immediately from way too much lactose, then watch my partner gape at the empty cheese package. >.> Mmm now I want cheese...
Anyone a little surprised that there was no text in the scrolling shots?
Dude used Mexican beer for beer cheese smdh...
317,393rd view
OWO
In the UK we completely ignore the shire in Worcestershire sauce and just call it Worcester (pronounced wuss-ter) sauce.
No dude.  Freshly steamed artichokes only.  Canned and jarred are disgusting by comparison
I use sour cream instead of cream cheese for spinach artichoke dip. I’ll have to try cream cheese and see which I like better!
Why does it seem like Americans are obsessed with béchamel sauce? It’s like the most boring thing ever. Yet any American person that it’s been brought up in conversation with goes nuts over it.
Hey, Babish! Love your work!

... And I also used to love cheese dips (and cheese in general) before my lactose sensitivity started to get the best of me. Got any tips for what I could do or use as an alternative?
Babish says "Cayenne,"
I look for Chef John in the comments
18 second still at the end, for that ad revenue eh?
Always a good day when you're deathly I'll a BWB video comes out
Queso-not-so-fundido

Bye
Why does every 'dip' contain cheese?
The best part of this video would have been watching you try to clean the dishes at the end....
do a healthier episode!
I don't even know how to cook but I love Watching Babish!
Whats the shire sauce
Use creator code Babish in the fortnite item shop
Someone please tell me the reference for his Rolex.

Whosthehowsthewhatstheshire.
Could you please do the potato chip from Death Note?
Why all the unnecessary shot changes? :'(
Are you taking a sponsorship from dairy farmers of America? This is the 3rd super cheesy episode in 2 months.
My lactose intolerance kicked in just watching the video.
Every time Babish says cheese take a shot, guaranteed to kill you
what is the significance of artichoke hearts in these kinds of dips?
ALL THE CHEESE! 

Might have to try out that spinach dip one of these days.
"Say you find yourself with a 4 pound block of sharp cheddar cheese. What do you do with it?"
Eat the whole thing.
First thing I do when I come home from school: watch BWB
I'm hungry because of this😊❤️👍 I wish I could be able to make this but I don't have the ingredients
Any bets on whether the next video he uploads will be "Mac and Cheese"?
I miss the old "So, I'd like to take a minute to talk about about brain hiccup square space."
The legendary mini toast, minus the hummus.
I love that when he says dips, he means, cheese dips. Lol
I call dibs... 

I mean dips...


On the last nacho chip...
Something about this video just made me wish it never ended. You have to do a part 2.
Big Smoke approves this video.
Is any of these the one that woman's head fell in back in 1957?
A non chees part pls!!!
"How to melt cheese"
I would order extra of those dips
One 2 lb brick of Velveeta, one 16oz jar of queso dip, one 8oz can of Rotel, and one pound of browned Jimmy dean sausage. Crack dip.
That cheese stretch!
Pizza ball - the shell
Needs crab dip
Title should maybe be 'cheesy cheese dips'
He’s just been falling back on cheese melts the past couple videos,
Cheese Dip
Cheese Quesadilla
Cheese Grill 
We get it Babs, cheese melts...
Buffalo chicken dip is heaven my mother makes the best
Hell yeah, big fan of this.
Do stuff with fiddleheads. The seasons coming!
The amazing whats-the-shire sauce
Alternate title: Babish tries using up all the left-over cheese from the grilled cheese episode.
I feel like Babish needs to pick up some Sodium Citrate for his cheese melting projects. Last week or so, he used gelatin (I think?) and this week corn starch... Just seems like he's using alternatives to Sodium Citrate. (Though the gelatin may have played a part in hardening the cheese for the sandwich)
This isn’t traditional, but I love adding finely chopped caramelized onions to spinach artichoke dip. Highly recommend.
If you’re going to keep it up with the cheese theme, do mac and cheese!
I'm salivating.
The best dip ever....one block of cream cheese, one bottle of old English cheese, put in a bowl zap in the microwave adding garlic salt and use bagels to dip.... bagel Dip
D: that aint queso
I hate when I accidentally buy a 4 pound block of cheddar cheese
Only cheese dips?
too bad i have lactoseintoldlerants
PLEASE STOP USING PLASTIC WRAPS! I live in India and we're doing quite fine without it in our kitchens. Every time you use plastic wraps, but insides literally churn. I love this channel, and I'm sure you could easily switch to more biodegradable , sustainable options. Plastic wraps are really a useless, harmful, first world, capitalist thing. They have no place on this planet in 2019. Peace.
Buff Chick dip is the king of all dips and I’m VERY disappointed
DJ Khaled doesn't do dips..... He's on a diet....

Have you done an ice cream basics episode?
There isn’t a perfect vide-

As a Certified Wisconsinite, I can confirm that you have most of the midwest, and in particular, most of my Wisco comrades, drooling!😋
I miss the intros.  The "let's get back down to Basics"
title: dips
content: cheese
2:17 Modello time baby!
Just to let you know. I bought a garlic crusher because you use it so much. The day I bought it, I used it twice. 🙏
You wouldn't think two blights on this earth like spinach and artichoke would make such a good dip but good god is that stuff delicious.
Hard disagree with the beer choice. You need a yeasty  American beer for beer cheddar anything
You didn't dip into the cheese ball, you're dead to me.

Garlic  Creme Dip?🥺
Should do the Huxtable hoagie for an episode
Yeah, love the episode and all, but a lot of fans seem to agree that four cheese-dips in a dips-basics video is a bit of an overkill. Would love to see a follow-up with bean dips, guac and salsas. Hope you know we criticize because we care. Keep up the good work!
*Cheese Dips
Basic to dipping: grab a can, pack it, grab desired amount with your thumb and index finger, place your pinch in your bottom cheeck, pack with your tounge, strain as desired, remove after satisfaction is achieved. Wait, I think thats the wrong kind of dip....
It's Modelo time!
I’m sorry, the daddy of all dips is a nice, slightly spicy sausage dip
that cheese ball looks so so so so gross
Have you thought about doing chilaquiles? maybe with some eggs and avocado, don’t forget the cheese and the green salsa (or red, or even better, both salsas)
Why does tiny whisk get the fame and not tiny rubber spatula
1:54 now let’s say you find yourself with a FOUR POUND BLOCK OF CHEESE!!!!!!!
DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR HORRIBLE PUNS !!!!!
thank god i've always sucked at making cheese dip, comes out tasting weird af
It should be called "Getting fat with Babish"
Colon: "Was this back log soooo worth it?"
Me: " iiiieeeeeekkkkkYup!!"
Buffalo chicken dip FTW ANDREW
I just get Velveeta 3 cheese and melt/mix it with a can of rotel.

If I want it fancy I mix in some cooked sausage or ground beef.
"woost-er-sheer" Sauce
im so glad im not lactose intolerant
You showed that cheese getting put in the bowl twice ;p
Hey Andrew, what kind of watch are you wearing? It's pretty fresh.
Are you still going to do an episode for college students ?
Should be called dips with cheese
Kinda should've titled this video "Cheese dips" instead of dips...
Extra dip
I love the show and all but a bowl of cheese is not a "dip"
These are all just melted cheese
I'm lactose intolerant and this is how I want to die
you seem off in this video
Modelo tiime
You said the c word
So the first cheese mixture actually reminds me of something commonly served in Germany, more specifically the region I come from, called "Obazda", which calls for Camembert, Onions, Pepper, Paprika, Cream Cheese and butter. It's the best thing to ever touch the surface of this planet and you can't convince me otherwise.
Not gonna lie Babish, a little disappointed that a TV addict like yourself didn’t open this one with Leo from the West Wing’s ‘Andrew Jackson had a big block of cheese’ speech.
OH NO. Not during diet season
OMG the first american chef ever to pronounce Worcestershire sauce with out making a fuss about it. CONGRATS DADDY BABS!
Honest to God, I was waiting for a snarky remark at the end, because that's not pimento cheese, my friend.  I don't know who lied to you, but you should never trust anything they say, ever again.
Omg beer cheese is my love of all loves, my weak spot, it's what I dream about on an amazing nights sleep! Thank u so much for sharing. If I could I'd make it everyday lol but I have to alternate w the spinach artichoke dip hahaha 🤘🤩 love it channel. Thanks again.♡♡☆☆
Cheese and more cheese, how about all the other dips? 
Salsas and so on. Come on
Nice watch..where did u buy it? @Babish i need one💯👌
Very surprised you didn’t cover buffalo chicken dip
would have loved to see a crab dip
beer and cheese dip is also how you take a normal mac and cheese and turn it into a knock out mac and cheese
You inspire me
perfect
Number 6
This episode was called "Dips", but it was all cheese dips. Maybe re-name it "Cheese Dips"

To whoever’s reading this, you’re a dip! :D

Sorry and have a great day! :)
What kind of watch is that? Looks nice
Still freaking HATE your intro tune. Please come up with something else. Or go back to Frasier!

Ok but a good fetta and roasted tomato dip is good too. Fetta is cheese still but not quite like the other cheesey things you've done. 
Don't get me wrong, this episode had me drooling like I just got out of the dentist with numb lips, but like everyone else it seems you should do a part two that doesn't involve as much cheese if any.
Come on man I'm in schooll 😣
this episode made me lactose intolerant
seriously  How are you not fat????? If i could cook like you, I would weight 400lbs for sure
At 4:11 did you say to cook the spinach for 45 minutes?! Did you mean 45 seconds? Which... actually, one sounds like too long and the other like too short a time, so... I don't know... 🤔
@BingingWBabish
 Hey I’m a big fan of your show and I really like it when you make food from cartoons and superhero movies so I was wondering if you could make Green Arrows hottest chili that even Superman can’t eat without being burnt there are pictures that have the complete ingredients
Babish, you’re better than your theme song. It’s about time you got someone to write a better one. It pains me to hear that shit at the beginning of one of your amazing videos
Where is Brewing with Babish?
Is it not socially acceptable to eat a cheese ball with a spoon? Huh...

a) I LOVED those puns. b) i just perked up hearing about froyo from the good place. hopefully it's just as mediocre as described in the show. :D
"Thorbet" just sounds like you're mocking people with a lisp. 






I mean, I'd still eat it, but that's what'd run through my mind the whole time.
Me: *sees the Walnut ice cream *

Me:....

Me: 
**SPOILER WARNING**







Eating this ice cream before dinner will definitely spoil it.
You should do an anime related food.
Literally Nobody :

"Actually, those cups don't look like the real Ben and Jerry's cu-"
"Raspberry" Binging with Babish 2019
Covered with correct size pan lid and the chocolate never melted.
I feel like the raspberry Thorbet needs poprocks or something mixed in to make it complete.  Either that or streaks of blue raspberry 'lightning.'
i DARE you to try and make a positive spin on alison's sandwich from the breakfast club (pixie sticks, captain crunch and butter with a slight generic spicy meat residue)
Mr.Babish I don't feel so good...
I'm really curious as to why you didn't add a little spice to the hunka hulka BURNING fudge.
This channel needs something from the Sweedish Chef.  Just sayin'
" You look like melted ice cream. "

I see a leaf ;)
This is a perfect example why you should buy ice cream.😂it’s takes to dang long.
I'm randomly reminded of this time in high school, we were in earth science class, and I mentioned that rock salt is the same as table salt, and one of my classmates was so shocked because "they use that in ice cream!"


If I were more knowledgeable on the culinary arts at the time, I probably would've told him "yeah, they use salt in pretty much everything."
Babish: Now we have to start a process known as Tempering.
Me, thinking about Bon Appetit’s Claire: Oh I know what tempering is
Binging with Babish please I am begging you please. Make Yeto's soup from the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

HOLY SHIRT YOUR MAKING A RECIPIE FROM THE GOOD PLACE I LOVED THAT SHOW
Fans: We hate the way you've  been saying "whisk," please stop.
Babish: Okay I'll stop.


Also Babish: "KH-WHOPPING"
To me, you kinda sound like lemony Snicket (from A series of unfortunate events) if he was a chef.
“Thorbet” sounds like someone with a lisp trying to say sorbet.
cia agent: (BEN AND JERRY WANT'S YOUR LOCATION)
When he said Froyo from The Good Place I got so hyped! I can't wait for that. I want to taste the feeling of a fully charged phone battery. Thank you.

“Hunka Hulka Burning Chocolate is my magnum opus” - Babish 😂
He gets obviously real Ben and Jerry's ice cream containers and then claims he recreated the artwork. 

 
I'm disappointed in you, you've seemed so honest in previous videos. 🙄
Woah I’m looking forward to the good place froyo
Can you do a grilled Frank from It's always sunny
If hulk's was burning fudge, you could've made the fudge spicy to truly make it burning
There's LITERALLY NO POINT in unliking this video.
Ben and Jerry’s should have done this tbh
When you eat too much ice cream

Me:i don't feel so good
You should make the Oreo and french fry pizza from Mr deeds
I just found your page, and I got to say i love your channel.
GOOD PLACE FROYO?
hell yeah
A thought on how to improve at least the look of the Raspberry Thorbet would be to add blue streaks throughout the mixture, like lightning bolts (besides, raspberry flavour being blue is a common thing)
Please do one of the brain recipies from Izombie!! 👏🏻🧟‍♀️🧟‍♀️
IS ANY ONE ELSE SLIGHTLY TRIGGERED CUS HE SNAPPED?!?!?! 😭😂😢
fina’denne.

You should try the dinner from Mrs. Doubtfire!
When's the froyo from The Good Place coming out? I need to prepare myself physically and mentally.


(no for real though The Good Place is my second favorite show, first being The Office and I need the froyo from The Good Place in my life)
A lot of people seem to think there should have been some spicy "burn" in the Hunka Hulka Burnin' Fudge...
My only question - Why is it not green?
I did those ice creams on my show too!  Wish I would have thought of the cups, lol ...Great job! 👊😁
you should make five's peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich (with a side of a decent cup of coffee) from umbrella academy
Really love your channel, could you include metric measurments in your videos?
This is beautiful. 👏🏽👏🏽 we need Ben&Jerry’s to do this irl tho.
I'm glad someone as professional as Babish also uses the wrong sized pot lids.
“you might even say it’s a snap”

Me :My membership in the vegan society

Why not make any anime foods? Like The anime Shokugeki no souma
Next Time:Chum Fricasee From Spongebob Squarepants
Pop Rocks + Thorbet.  Do Pop Rocks still work when cold?
These are amazing but i think the hulk flavor should have had so kind of spicy element to it,  like Mexican hot chocolate.  That would've covered the "burning" fudge part.
Stark Raving Hazelnut
Raspberry Thor bet 
Hulk a Hukka Raving Fudge
Scarlet Cherry
 Beer Float
 Chocolate Swirl

Mr Babish... I don't feel so good.
Too soon..
can you do the curry from persona 5???
Make food from Jojo’s bizarre adventure (mainly from “let’s eat Italian food”)
When Ben and Jerry’s steals these I hope they pay you 😂
Can you make the Klav Kalash from The Simpson
Just go and buy GRZYCAN lol
Is the wrong sized pot lid a requirement?
Other idea? “Black Widough” dark chocolate ice cream with shortbread cookie dough chunks and raspberry swirls.
Loved it 3000
Woah you should quit cooking and start drawing
Eyeholes...Just make sure that guy doesn't break through a window and kick the shit out of you.
are you seriously leaning on the cauldron of the cosmos..?
5:07 Raspberry Thorbet
you sould do a aqua velva from zodiac
I’m a little disappointed that you didn’t address the “burning” component of “Hunka Hulka Burning Fudge.” Perhaps a bit of cayenne added to the fudge to give it some heat?
shouldve been a cap ice cream. "america's rasp"
6:52 TOO SOON
Next please make Wongs tuna melt
The whistling in the song makes me think of the time I was sick and my lungs made a similar sound. I can't not hear it.... Makes it pretty hard to watch the vids.
microwave lasagna from Brooklyn 99 please :3
These flavors should be on Ben & Jerry's menu's
Could you please please pleaseee make Meemaw’s Brisket from Young Sheldon?
That snap joke was triggering 😢
Make the colorful “stuff” from the lost boys feast in Hook

Videoly request for Tonio's spaghetti and other courses from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.


Also, nailed it with the B&J's design. Those are some pint containers worth paying nearly $7 for.
Hulka Hunka Burning Fudge would sound great with some chilli. Kinda gives meaning to the "burning" part.
can u make burek next? its delicious
Imagine being paid for making ice cream tutorials
You should make Kevins chilli
Black widow cherry forest i think is one
You missed an oh so obvious opportunity. A white chocolate fudge swirl dyed green with food coloring.
“thorbet” is how I said sorbet before i got my lisp fixed
Dear Binging with Babish, please make the Tortilla Chip Taco Hat from Despicable Me 2
But what makes it burning fudge? I half expected chili flakes to be added in the end.
What about Ant Man's Blowup Taco?
How has this been a thing for years and Ben and Jerry’s didn’t follow through and make it real?
Is that a new tattoo or just some Thor themed artwork for this episode?
It seems to me that the "burnin'" part of Hunka Hulka Burnin' Fudge could be achieved with a sprinkling of chili flakes.
That Thor Ice Cream doesn’t look right....






“I knew it”
Who got a Chris Hemsworth commercial before this?
When you’re making those Good Place Frozen Yogurts you better make Peeps Chilli too, you coward.
Can you make the Smelly Sunday from Spongebob?
If you ever feel like doing more ice creams My recommendations, the Banana Pudding and Nutella chip flavors from This Is Us.
Can you make donuts from The Umbrella Academy.
With just a snap of his fingers, Babish can destroy all cilantro instantly.
I like covering my nuts in sugar
Is the wrong sized pan lid required?
It should be green watch end game
Ben And Jerry should made those for real
I love how he works with nuts.
Α hack about the hazelnuts. After you boil them put them in a container with a lid and shake them. They should peel right off
Hey Babish could you please recreate Silver's Stew from Treasure Planet?

“I don’t feel so good...”
“Did you eat the ice cream?”
“Yeah but-“
“Your lactose intolerant! I know because your aunt told me! Hey, I wonder what she’s doing right now. Maybe she thinking of me?”

One of the flavors should involve Schwarma...

You should make a reddit where once a month you make a recipe suggested by one of us. That would be awesome! (credit to my boy "Sans Mans" please do this)
Please could you cook some chilled ochazuke from emiya san chi no kyou no gohan? I think it would be a great recipe for this summer!
Hunka Hulka burning fudge not being green is a crime.

Hey Babish, check your email when you get the chance please.
Expected actual chunks of fudge.
Did he draw a mallet on his arm or is that a tattoo I haven’t noticed until now?🤣
The best thing is Binge watching Binging with Babish Videos
Mr.Babish.. I don't feel so good...
hey I got one for you my friend, there's this one thing in the anime Konosuba where they use the crab shell to hold the "guts" and they put it over a flame with some kind of alcohol. not sure how tht works but feel free to take a stab at it
You should make pizza straws from Bob's burgers.
You're amazing
On an unrelated, related note: has anyone here tried Ben & Jerry's Cinnamon Bun ice cream? It. Is. LIFE-CHANGING! 🤤
I know it sounds weird but can I have your beard I want a magnificent beard like you but unfortunately mine isn't as luscious and puffy as yours is
Confession time: My boyfriend bought a tiny whisk for me so I can say “Courtesy of.. tiny whisk” while I cook now 😂 He bought for the sole purpose of me saying it. I had a small whisk that I used before, but now, my sauces are truly courtesy of tiny whisk.

I don’t see how this man gets dislikes WHATS NOT TO LIKE
"We're gonna remove our chunk of future frozen gelato and add it to our chilled stuff"

Hate to break it to ya, but gelato and sorbet aren't the same thing, bossman. Gelato's just fancy ice cream with higher ratios of milk:cream, with less to no eggs, and it's churned slower so it's less airy.
Show your alcohol collection pretty please
Thould have been rathberry thorbet
GOOD PLACE! YES
Monster hunter world foods please!
Ah, funnies with learning. Not all heroes funniest capes... or-- have an ice-cream named after them at Ben & Jerry's. 🥴

FYI- If you freeze your pint carton upside down, it will appear like there's more in it when it's uncapped and dug into. Little trick from working at 31 flavors for 5 years. Love the artwork and wish I could taste that Hunka Hulka Burning Fudge, damn that sounds outstanding!! Cheers!
If you ever do an ice cream Basics episode, please consider Ben & Jerry's From Russia With Buzz. One serving would give you a caffeine buzz and damn it was good.

The camera focus is a bit off in this video? Did they use a super close lenses??
There was this super spicy chip challenge that was so popular that it even got featured on the news. I don't know what name specifically was called. But I believe that it was just a giant potato chip with a whole lot of spice flavoring on it.

Is it possible to make a Babish version of a spicy chip challenge?

You all have no idea how significant that snap is at the end after that hunk of hulk reference.

Hey babish! My wife and I were grocery shopping and neither of us knew how to tell if a mango was ripe. Afterwards, we both thought maybe it would be a good video idea for you to do a basics episode explaining how to tell if fruits, veggies, and meats are good, as well as how to cut them or prepare them. Thanks! We both love you and the show.
Please do purple Flurp from Jimmy Neutron I’m begging you

Yo Babish, Trump just had a massive brain fart on twitter as usual. I think you should create “Stollen”  the German fruitcake he mentioned.
Oh Ironman flavor oooooo it tastes like rust
Love this. There goes my diet. lol
And with a snap of Babish's fingers, half of all ice cream flavors in the universe were wiped out.

I'm not sure why in chocolate desserts you stand by your stance of "coffee doesn't make it taste like coffee it enhances chocolate flavour".
While even some "pure" chocolates chips have a subtle hint of coffee in them, the "subtle hint" actually tastes like coffee. That doesn't seem to bother you, but as someone that really dislikes the taste of coffee, I can taste it whenever there's even a "subtle hint" in a chocolate dessert and it makes for a worst experience for me. That would probably be the same if someone try to sell you that cilantro (coriander) actually enhances the flavor of tacos.
THE GOOD PLACE?!?!?

I was hoping after the snap, a Hunka Hulka Burning Fudge was the last one left since it was your favorite.
It's funny, in latin american spanish the Iron Man ice cream was called "Avellana Iron Mango" (Hazelnut Iron Mango) which I don't think is a good combination. This is better definetly.
Still a little chalky....
you should try to make rolled ice cream
Ending would of been better if you faded out, the ice creams did, or half the ice cream entered the clean plate club
I hope Ben & Jerry’s makes these
Hulka hulka burning fudge should have been mint ice cream

I feel like burning fudge implies atleast a shot of whiskey in the ice cream for that burn
Next time you have a seive of stuff you want sieve hit the handle with your fist and it goes through faster than using a spoon.

I'm Thor-oughly disappointed that you didn't make the Hulk ice cream with chilies, considering they said  burning fudge
i think the hulk should have been mint ice cream with a fudge swirl and chocolate chunks

Even though i dont cook using your videos, i like to watch you mix the ingredients. The only problem is that i am usually in a loud area and it is hard for me to hear the video. So i put on captions but I can see the product anymore. Is there any possible way to put the captions at the top of the screen?
Where can you get it
We all know, anything cheese gets viral.
Don’t think I didn’t see what you did there
Kind of sad there was no heat in Hulk's "Burning" fudge. A shot of chili pepper would have been perfect.

Nerdy things + ice cream? Hello, two of my absolute favorite things ever. This makes me extremely happy.
Why are you so stingy with the size of your bowls?
I wonder when Babish will recreate Minnie's Chocolate Pie from The Help?
BABISH
Huge missed opportunity to add some heat to that Hulka Hulka Burning Fudge.  Some cayenne or other appropriate pepper and a touch of cinnamon in the swirl would have been the way to go.
I bet iron man would love a taste of that ice cream. Poor guy
@binging with babish you should really show the dry-ice method as well for making ice cream. You don't need an ice cream machine and you get smaller ice crystals for a better mouthfeel as well.
Yeah he snapped
Spider-Man ice cream flavor: sticky sugar cotton candy
wwoooaaahhhhhhh
这样做好吃嘛？
I wish you made the hulk one green
I wanted half the ice cream to disappear when you snapped.

I don't know why but I have a random memory when I was a kid, I walked into a giant white warehouse and made vanilla ice cream. I dont know if it was a dream or not I literally no idea why I have this memory.
NUT
so no one here actually cooks right?
Ok.
I like my icecream how I like my racial and ethnic buildup of society. 02:05
For the hulk one, since he said it was called “burning fudge” I thought you were going to make a chocolate/pepper mixture of some kind. As someone who (unfortunately) hasn’t been very adventurous culinarily, the prospect of ice cream with a bit of a peppery kick sounded really intriguing, hot and cold in one scoop.
Do BMO’s cup-cake from adventure time
That Simpsons joke tho
I never get the pop up links whenever he says "click the link in the top right now," anyone else?
Stop reading the comments, theres spoilers :)
Bring Julia or Barb from America’s test kitchen as a guest plssss best cross over ever
At the end that was a bad bad joke you shouldn’t have said that
I thought they actually existed?
I think Hulk is eating Hunka Hulka Burning Fudge in end game, but it looks green almost like Pistachio ice cream? Thoughts on a 2.0?
Ironman dies
Good god so much sugar
Hwhopping
This must taste amazing huh? I wouldn’t know because I friggin hate chocolate icecream.
How about nebluberry ice cream?
hwhopping
dies
STOPPP
In the film Misery, the character Annie (played by the remarkable Kathy Bates), makes a meatloaf with spam in it. While I love spam, this seems very bizzare. I'd love to see your take on meatloaf and possibly what you think of that recipe.
Hulk's ice cream is burning fudge! It should be spicy chocolate.
when he said frozen yogurt from the good place I almost died
Anyone else in 4098?
soo what next 
golden opportunity to snap all three the half clean cup club with movie magic at then end
why not sell them in stores, make actual flavors
I love you 3000



(No homo)
Try the Spider-Man flavor. It tastes like Dust.
You should make spiced peaches from holes
1:28
HEY I SAW THAT
Butterbeer from harry potter!
This is actually really cool. GJ Babish
You should do the different styled steaks from Letterkenny! Pitter patter bud
Its just icecream
Hulk: humans hate me
Humans: let’s name an ice cream after him uwu
y'all remember when B&J wasn't all political?
Please do the calzones from we bare bears
Damn half my family died after the end...
Is this a paid ad?
Next Up: Spider-Man’s dust
Personally I feel like Hulka Hulka Burning Fudge could have been fudge swirl and chocolate chunks in chocolate sriracha-infused ice cream.
Babish! You did not do the Hulk ice cream justice because you missed the “burning” part of the ice cream name! You missed a perfectly good opportunity to put chile in it!
Ok I bet none of you can say A Hunka Hulka Burning Fudge three times fast
Could you try to make the breakfast smoothie from Benny and joon with the grilled cheese and tapioca pudding!! That would be so awesome
I'm honestly super excited for froyo from The Good Place.
Mr.Stark I don't feel so good.
Also you snapped and half the ice cream didn't disappear... Missed opportunity.
I hope we actually see one of these flavours in one of the movies, just one of the tubs on a desk as an Easter egg or something
呃，好像还行？
At 5:06 Andrew becomes Mike Tyson himself.
You know what would go good with those.......some infinity cones...
Tiny whisk is my favorite MCU hero.
Hulka burning fudge.... Should have had jalapeños in it. Personal opinion.
um i still need to see a lot of marvel movies
RIP Howard Potts
I want me some Thorbe
“Nut” “Hardens”
Yum
Yum
If you're bored and want to spice up your sorbet try simmering cut habaneros in the raspberry puree. Raspberry habanero sorbet is amazing as well as a mind f*ck (spicy and freezing at the same time)
Could you do the potato chip from Death Note?
Can you recreate “Kevin cooks stuff in the office” from the office websode please?
just watched the movie and your a bastard for that half spoiler.....
“Then once no single nut is atop the other,...”

-Binging With Babish 2019
I don't see the "Apple FADErd" flavor
Can't wait to see you make fro yo from the good place!
More like binging with Picasso
6:54. Mr banish.. I don't feel so good
Tiny whisk will always be the star of the show
love you 3000
Clam chowder froyo please
Make the Phantom Ramen from Space Dandy!!!
Anyone else finding it really hard to follow the super fast narrative? My brain hurts!
Getting tired of snap jokes but damn if those aren't some great looking frozen desert containers.
Is it me or do I see a evil type of face on the pot at 5:08
"Easy to make" he says...
Creative Idea!
Cap America would have vanilla ice cream with apple pie chunks.

Black Widow gets a spicy gingerbread, honey, and jam ice cream with a sour cream base. 

Nick Fury is the mystery flavor special. The carton and even the look of the ice cream gives no clues to the flavor. The ice cream is made in different color batches.
#7 on trending street
im just gonna eat all the mixtures
Ben and Jerry’s - take note!
hunk of hulk is green, you can even see prof. hulk binging on it.
I wish you’d be my dad

Could you try to make the peraltiago cocktail from Brooklyn nine nine?
...iron man
No spicy heat in the burning fudge?
1:07 You did not properly introduce the tiny whisk. I am very disappointed in you, sir.
6:53 >:(
Dude said iced cream
HAZEL      N U T        S
was anybody else getting constantly recommended the original ice cream video the day before this came out, also when is Dead Rising Orange Juice?
why am I watching this, like I'm really bout to make this?
I love u 3000
Clout
Not adding spiced Mexican chocolate to the Hulk one was a serious missed opportunity, 
but I guess that just gives me all the more reason to try it myself.
You are one of my roll models, Bobby and  watched you 11months and I am also opened my channel 2days ago. Thank you very much for about many things even you don't know what I say. I could learn many things from your videos.  I really wish you always be happy and healthy and promise I will be your fan for a long long time.  Bye.
RICK AINSLEY CHIKEN PLEASEEEE
make the award winning chili from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"
Raspberry Thorbet? But Mike Tyson isn’t an Avenger, is he?
so when you gifting us with The Mississippi Queen from regular show?
Needs to do a colab w/ Man About Cake

The sorbet needed some streaks of lemon-flavored blue. Plus the light burst of citrus would have brought out the flavor and added a little spark ^_~
I love these recipes 3000
You should make what Bubble Bass first orders in the SpongeBob episode pickles
What about loki icecream..? Maybe lochee? (Lichee for loki)
Make Kevin's famous chili from The Office

Why we killing the heat what did it do to you ?
I thought hunka hulka burning fudge would have had CINNAMON or something of that nature...because of BURNING. OPTION TO SPICE IT UP PLS AND THNX
You  should do Fish fingers and custard from Doctor Who.
Anyone else think his voice sounds like Alton Brown?
Any ice cream names for captain America?
Can I have a cheeseburger

In french dub the ice cream for Hulk is "Hulk's Pistaccios"
Binge and Jerrys is a ice-cream ill always eat.
Robo-Sandvich from TF2.  And no, I don't expect you to eat it.
"You might even say it's a snap." Get out, you're no longer welcome here.

Hey beautiful tubers just a small guy here needed some help trying to grow hit me up! Thank you! ♡
Norii is happy for this

I know you’d probably get sued by either Disney or Ben and Jerry’s so you don’t have to but that would be fun
That snap was very hurtful how could you
But can you deep fry my kebab?
Babish snaps 
Half of the worlds Kosher salt Disappears
Your voice is so soothing and your food looks great.

YAY FROZEN YOGURT FROM THE GOOD PLACE

Hulk Ice Cream has to be green.  No exceptions
END GAME ZONE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
everyone who watched end game leave spoilers in the replys below↓↓
YEESSS😭😭😂
Hey, this is unrelated to the video, but what kind of wrap do you use to cover doughs? The murky stuff that resembles parchment paper but adheres to the sides of the bowl? It's kinda bugged me for a while.
Wheres Black berry Widow
That snap at the end was totally unnecessary :(
WHY aren’t these real ice cream flavours?! I would totally buy them.
I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me Jesus said faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God 👣❤️📖📖📖
Black widow goes back in time and sacrifices herself for the soul stone
Thor gets a beer belly 
Iron man has a daughter and he dies at the end
Spider-Man lives
I feel like Captain America should have gotten a flavor but Stephen Colbert already stole the name "Americone Dream" so I don't think there's a better pun there
Can you please do a basics video showing how to cook with a wok?
I never noticed that Babish has a lisp.
I don’t think anyone who watches this channel can cook it’s just mesmerizing
高糖啊我的妈
Should of snapped into a cross section...
I thought when Doctor Strange said a bit chalky I thought he meant the name of the ice cream
what is that cling film/food wrap that he keeps using here?
That’s was 176 degrees
Another option for skinless hazelnuts is to roast them first and then drop the still-warm-but-not-flesh-burning nuts into one of those plastic mesh bags that onions come in. Rub the whole thing vigorously, either over a trash can or outside, and the skins will flake off and rain down through the holes in the bag.
Wondering if you could use a cheesecloth for the bit when you strain the raspberry seeds out?
I hate how the hazelnuts look like chick peas
Crayfish chowder from Witcher 3: Blood and Wine DLC. The recipe is in game.
"you might say it's a snap" STILL TOO SOON.
Even though it's not ice cream, Capsicles would be neat.
Babish upload day is a good day.
Love you 3000
Or make love not war machine
Double fudge drax the destroyer
ITS A SNAP! OH MAH GOD. NO HE DIDNT!

Friendly neighborhood Spider-sherbert
I scream.....you scream.......we all scream for Babish's Ice Cream!
For one of your next videos, you should make chebureki or goulash from Life of Boris. I have made them but altered a bit, they are very good. Also for chebureki, you should cook the meat before you fill them.
Raspberry racoon
Dr strange strawberry supreme
Tasty ?
"You might even say it's a snap"💀
Babish: you might even say it's a snap

Very vanilla vision

Could you please do a video on food from Food Wars like: the dongpo pork curry bowl, quail stuffed with risotto and eggs, or mapo tofu? Some of them look complicated but I'd love to see you try to take a crack at them!
so melted ice cream is thor
Protip: when adding your tempered eggs back to the dairy, do so through a mesh sieve.  This will catch any scrambled bits and/or chalaza.
What culinary school did he go to?! He is an amazing cook.
Food wars! Shokugeki no Soma?
I would have labeled it "Bing & Babish: *Insert Flavor Here*"
Can you make the sailor moon sausage from amazing world of gumball?
My heart hurt when he said ''Snap''
Hulk ice cream wins, and a 'snap' joke. Andrew, you are definitely my favorite for a reason.
Uno aquí sin entender ni madres pero aun así lo mira :v xd
You missed one of the big things to include in Stark Raving Hazelnut, which should have included coconut. In Iron Man 2 he comments how the new power core "tastes like coconut... and metal" - I wouldn't want you to try the metal part, but at the very least you should have coconut in there.
I love these ice cream recipes 3,000
Mr.Babish I don’t feel so good.
WHHWWapping
Wait what 3:33
ROB HIS KITCHEN
OMG THX
What if Thor’s ice cream is so rich and so sweet that only the worthy of the worthy can handle it?
Diabeties intensifies.
Captain marvel mango
Nom
And thus, using the infiity spoon, Babish created the perfect flavor of ice cream. It remains unnamed and unseen, for only he could eat it.
"it's a snap" -i'm 
also FROYO FROM THE GOOD PLACE FORK YEAH
Literally impossible to say Raspberry Thorbet without laughing or at the very least smiling. Genius
I was really expecting some heat for the “Burning Fudge” part uahahahhahaha
I know that you like doing things in threes, but you should’ve only done the two, keeping things “perfectly balanced”
Here are my Babish requests:
* Sea Salt Ice Cream from Kingdom Hearts
* Fish Tacos from Rocket Power
* Fish Fingers and Custard from Doctor Who
* Blue Milk from Star Wars
YOU'RE DOING FROYO FROM THE GOOD PLACE?!?!?!?! I LOVE THAT SHOW!!!!!!!
Please make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show!
the burning fudge could have used some chili pepper maybe, get that "burning" effect
Hell with cooking.. should should have been an artist!
Wow, that's... that's A LOT of sugars.
The terrible puns....
so good
Yes 😂
Ant-Man's Bananant Split
You should of used a piece of worlds spiciest chocolate :)
🤘🤘🤘
Waiting for a Christmas cookie episode. Yes, I know it’s spring.
Trending with Babish!
You HAVE to explain why the others did bit make the cut.
What scene is this? I don’t remember
Hehehe youtube comments would be a great place to spoil...
You guys watch Spider-Verse yet?
every adult needs to be humbled by a classroom of uninterested apathetic kids. It's good for the soul.
Boobish: You ready for cooking?
Middle schoolers: ʸᵉᵃʰ
Boobish: wheezes
I feel like the classroom part played out differently in Babby's head.
As someone who used to teach children with Autism, this episode hits close to home. I have many friends who teach. Each and every teacher I have ever known is selfless, compassionate, giving, caring, loving and generous.

Side note: I will be sad when the episodes keep going and my cameo in the intro is replaced, but I am also kinda looking forward to it as I am excited to see how each and every episode out-does the previous.

P.S. Andrew, you still owe me a cookbook! ;)
Babish: you guys like quesadillas? 
kids:yeah.......
i feel your pain.
I’m a young middle school drama teacher! This brought me to tears! I feel so Underappreciated sometimes this means the world to me!!!
Babish, enthusiastically: "You guys ready to do some cooking?!" 
One student, in a bored tone: "Yeeaaah."
Babish, silently: "Well, that didn't quite go as I had expected..."
BraD must be feeling jealous seeing babish calling Vincenzo "Vinny" so casually.
Hurricane Katrina? More like hurricane tortilla!
Vinny as in THE VINNY from THE It's Alive w/ Brad?! Well now we all know why he left the test kitchen...
He sort of looks like Michael from Vsauce...

But what is cooking? And how much does it weigh?
You're doing a lot more with your platform than expected keep it up man
Poor babish, those middleschoolers missed out on an opportunity of a lifetime 😂😢
Andrew: Let's do some cooking, you guys ready? 
One Kid: ...yeah

sounds about right
"I know it soumds weird but he's used to me being weird"
How you know you've been friends with someone for a long time
Oh man, I can't believe you poached Vinnie 😆

I mean, you're all probably on good terms, but that's quite the icon exchange!
"Keep cooking, I will if you will."

This touched my soul. I am a teacher too that teaches students how to cook. 😢
Can't wait for the next new series
Bargaining with Babish
Where it's literally just Babish shopping for ingredients
As a middle school science teacher and long time fan of the show, thank you for doing this episode. It means a lot to hear someone with your platform lift up and encourage a profession that often gets dumped on. The pasta aglio e olio episode of Binging is what inspired me to start cooking, your Basics series has continued to educate and inspire me, and now Being with Babish has given me yet another reason to applaud the work you do. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you!
It actually made me tear up to see Rashid again... and such a sweet surprise...
The thumb nail should be named:
Being with Babish: Off my meds
I've been spiraling into depression for the past few weeks. My therapist said that it's most likely due to the depressing output that comes from my work. This series alone has helped me restore some faith in humanity
Won't lie, thumbnail is what got me to immediately click 😂😂😂
Love your stuff babby keep it up!
Can you stop cutting onions while I watch these episodes? Seriously moving sir.
Watching almost all your vids after your face reveal thinking "Hmm he doesn't look like Ryan Reynolds anymore" then comes 4:47 ...
I didn't even know I needed a pancake-peeker until now.
You're amazing and I loved this episode lol. You're doing it all right and I'm hoping you guys have a great trip and enjoy the time together. Teaches are amazing. Teaching food prep and cooking skills to kids is essential.
Someone has some good taste in cognac, I spotted that bottle of louis Tre, @20:18 will done good sir, well done!!
I noticed that you have a PlayStation. You wanna uhhh play sometime?
Is Vinny just an inside joke for Brad and Babs... If so the YouTube channel with Vinny-Bo-Binny's name on it is too far🤣🤣🤣
Let’s be honest, Vincenzo’s skills are wasted on this guy
“I don’t like children” 
- Babish
So vinny from bon apetite is also your cameraman huh brad would be proud
That's a nice way of making an ad. Lmao.
casual "i don't like children"
Whenever someone is in a hole they cant get out of. All they need is a helping hand. And you babbish are that helping hand. Changing people's outlooks on things. Helping and making people happy every day by either cooking, inspiring, or just being seen by someone. Keep doing this man. Love what you do. And you helped me learn some cooking tips too.
“Here’s a suitcase full of things, kids” - Babish 2019
Babish should do one for Vinny because it's Vinny and maybe Brad too
youve really come a long way in such a short time.  proud of you and your success.  hope it continues
I was not ready for those feels @bingingwithbabish
Gotta walk in like HEY GUYS I GOT 4.3MIL SUBS, WHO WANTS TO MAKE FOOD??
For some reason I read the title as Surprising Radish
AYE! My buddy is on cobra kai with Ralph macchio!
I appreciate you guys.

You're pretty transparent with the stuff that does and doesn't work. Even when that's a little awkward, like in front of unenthusiastic kids.

The Being with series is awesome. Thanks for your hard work. Keep pushing. You guys are doing amazing shit.

To you and your crew: be well, and thank you.
You teach too! Just online.. with “students” who actually subscribe to you.. ok it’s not quite the same, is it? :/
I greatly love and enjoy you.
“Oh God, he’s already in the doorway” had me dying.

Wow! I'm so jealous you got to meet Chef Morimoto, but also glad you got to meet him! :D



Pancake peeper....? Lol
Classic bald awkward 30y/o in a middle school
Oh you’ve gotta do something from Spiderverse!(if there is anything😅)
Babish should review restaurants in a series.
This helped me through a lot of physical pain, I'm so glad you make videos so often.
I need more happiness. (:
If you were at my class I’d be excited these kids man 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Hold up, you tellin me that not a single middle schooler in a cooking club knew Andrew? That's blasphemy!
What’s Babby been up to? Hmm. 

looks at defend videos





Thanks for the teacher appreciation. I can’t wait to see the vacation (I’m assuming you guys are going with?)
Babish... lowkey husband material
“Once every one managed to calm down” 

Yessss big fax i couldnt hear babish at all because they were so loud
Babish doesn't like kids?? He just became my spirit animal
Jo Andrew. That intro Song sounds dope as hell. You do good work.
Just like, in general. You run a real quality show.
Thanks for teaching me how to cook!
No one:
Not a single soul:
Babish: KOSHER SALT
Hey guy I think what yall do is effing amazing
Will you upload a Binging with Babish "Home Brew" special, featuring the 1982-1993 NBC sitcom "Cheers"?
I work with schools full time. Teens are awkward.😂😂
Once everyone managed to calm down

Lmfao
I'm a middle schooler and I watch you I AM TRIGGERED
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THESE VIDEOS
They always make me smile and I especially love Basics and Being but every single video is so good and I always know what to do when I have a bad time again 😊
This is why Babish is the Best
I'm new to your channel and I think you're an amazing person.  The class room and then your friend.  Wow.  Just wow.  ❤💙💚💛💜🖤
Dang, Babby! Why you gotta make me cry? ❤
When it becomes more than just a cooking show.

Love this show dude!
I think Andrew is gradually becoming my inspo in life.
You missed a perfect opportunity to call that utensil a ‘flatula’
BRUH YOU MET JUJU... I have NEVER in my life been so jealous.👏🏼
10:04 is that a Overwatch backpack
Thumbnail is a total thirst trap. Strong work 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Honestly I love this new series being with banish ❤️
Dude, you looked like Kratos in that thumbnail @ first!!!

That thumbnail is EVERYTHING.

I want it at my wedding and on my tombstone
Teacher here. Crying! As usual for this series but thank you for this.

I always found your videos fun and inspiring, but as a teacher, this one hit me right in the feels with New Orleans Beads!
Three weeks away from getting my degree in education. People shit on teachers. Thank you for this video.
I watch all the marvel movies
When I see a new episode of Being with Babish I have to watch it! This episode was amazing thank you <3 you are the greatest <3
You survived middle school a second time! Also very cool taking your friends back to New Orleans!🙌💖
Yo u should make Ed’s sauce from good burger and put it on a burger 
👇🏽 like if u agree
I thought you were surprising a radish, I’m disappointed
You should cosplay as Saitama.
"Vinny" some ones been featured on its alive with Brad leone😂
I thought the thumbnail was a Death Grips cover.
"once everyone managed to calm down" hahaha I died laughing!!😄
We need a new meme template of babish staring longingly at the picture of Rasheed.
I legit thought the thumbnail was a Death Grips MC Ride cosplay for half a second
America is so beautiful 😭 you'd never see something that nice happen in England
Babish is such an amazing person. Hell, he could be role model. Keep it up, Babish. <3
Why does babish have to be so goddam cute?
This is such a great series. It's always great to see people of influence giving back. Keep up the great work Mr. Rea!
Always hard the first time Andrew, i think you'd be a good teacher you've helped me so much.
As a middle school teacher I truly appreciate this episode. Thank you for all you do!
Hey BWB, love your videos man. I’ve always enjoyed watching your food tutorials and I really enjoy your charisma you bring to the chef table. Thanks man, keep up that good work.
Can you make the sushi from Isle of dogs?

Me, an innocent child scrolling through youtube:

Babish: is straight up iconic
You should make the "Pork Picnic" from Regular Show

Hard respect to Sawyer drinking the beer of all beer, blue light
"Here's a suitcase full of stuff for ya, kids." 

Since this video came out, did you check to see if you're in any national databases?
Petition for Babish to do a Kratos cosplay
Hey babish can you Do steamed cauliflower stew from Unikitty! Please pretty please!!!!
Its amazing to see how far you have gone. Keep it up!
As a freshman in college studying music education, this video hit me deep down. You have my deepest admiration Andrew, please continue being the most wholesome guy out there.
Thumbnail with Mardi Gras beads? Instaclick
5:20 due to lack of proper equipment, I often fry my eggs in a saucepan... ridiculous I know. But flipping them is dang near impossible. That little weird spatula would make my life so much easier

... so would a proper frying pan, I suppose
Your a good man.
This is one of the most important YouTube videos available today. Babish, fantastic job and please keep up the good work.
"how did you feel?"

"*speechless* I thought we were gonna watch spiderverse" :'D
"we're going to watch spiderverse" hand on the back
"we're going to watch spiderverse" 
 we're going to watch spiderverse
His face is like don't worry man, we got the stuff.


Idk why but I loved that reaction
You make my day better, babby. 

And I guess I have to finally watch Spider-Verse now.
Yo that oven is only 800$,I was expecting something closer to a couple thousand
This was the feel-good moment I didn't know I needed today.
Babish “I hate classroom smells”
Me: sitting in my middle school classroom “it’s absorbed into my being, yes I know that smell”
I'm against race mixing, but you two are such a cute couple.
Edit: Then Sawyer shows up to pine over you and your James Veitch-alike. Thirsty B.
I know your real name now!!!!! Idk if this was public knowledge before but I didnt know and now I do soo 🙂
“Here’s a suitcase full of stuff for yah kids” sounds like that creepy drug dealer in the alley ways of NYC my mother always warned me about
I really couldn’t tell if that’s an overwatch backpack or a Mercedes backpack
came for the thumbnail, stayed for the heartwarming story
Andrew you are such a genuinely good person, and I love you so much for that. Both for what you do, and the people you highlight on Being, you give me a little more hope for humanity on a rainy day like today.
Sawyer taking his shirt off was the highlight of my day. Thanks Sawyer. Love u
amazing episode. loved the message. awesome job you guys
Kratos in the thumbnail!
that thumbnail! I thought Babish was remaking "50 shades of gray or the new title..."50' shades of cooking spray"
Can we get an organic chemistry class from you called Benzene with Babish?
Babby's not cut out to be a teacher... at least not of children... luckily I'm a near-middle aged man so we're good.
Can u make a recipe that has something to do with eyebrow
Your Being With Babish videos genuinely make me smile. I can't think of any other YouTuber that does it as well as you do.
Can you make the turduckenen-duckenen thanksgiving food from vihart
Heart filled episode. Thank you for all of the content you bring to YouTube, Andrew.
Y’all are all STILL friends 14 years after Hurricane Katrina?? Y’all are goals!

What is the secret?
"Once everyone managed to calm down, we broke out the new gear". I could FEEL the excitement of those kids xD
Love this episode ! Teachers need more recognition for sure. That thumbnail doe...
I gotta say I clicked just for the thumbnail
Why is nobody talking about Beardless Baby Babish??? (8:43)
These episodes always make me cry. What you said to Rashid about his contribution as a teacher was beautiful. What a lovely friendship you all have. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Jesus Andrew is that solid gold Daytona?
Banish: “Are you ready to cook!”
Kids: “yeah...”
Awkward 😂
That thumbnail-title combo was a little...  Suggestive
Overwatch backpack at 9:55. GAMERS RISE UP
I teach kids in an out of school care program, ty for this video ❤ I feel appreciated
As someone that's been in so many middle schools for work, I FELT the pain of being a visitor and trying be engaging to middle school students early in the morning.


Also, can we get a heck yeah for teachers?!?!?!?!
Do Kindergarten teachers count as well? 😊💙
Babish:
Best Friend
Worst Neighbor
Make Ed's secret sauce from Good Burger😄
Hey you guys Michael from VSauce here! And this is my new cooking show!
a classic cheeseburger for tony stark.....please.
did he say "hey vinnie" to the camera guy like brad hahahah
I can't believe you got to hang out with 70s era Warren Zevon
I felt so Dad for Babish when he didn't get a nice reaction from the class.
Yo Babish, you look pretty ripped in that thumbnail.
Pun intended
Always glad to see another Babish video!
You should make Sanjis meatballs from onepiece anime
Clicked for Rashid — loved the video!
Idk why, but I've never imagined Andrew with hair??? 




I was expecting our bald boy in those Katrina pics 😂
That thumbnail DID NOT look like something you'd find on YouTube!
Until 9:30 I was JUST about to post "wait, throwing beads around and nobody's taken their shirt off yet?!"
You should do the spaghetti McBolognese from The Grand Tour.
Not gonna lie I want that oven- I just purchased another toaster oven 😆
This episode was quite different than the previous ones.  I preferred the other format, but still a good episode :D
Thank you for recognizing teachers for their hard work! Inner city students are hard to get amped for anything, haha!
It's great to see you and your team working to bring joy to us (: thank you
LOVE this series!! Keep it up Babish!
I'm living for the Spider-Verse promo
I'm an absolute MORON. I thought this read "Surprising Radish"
"I don't like children... let's show them how to make a quesadilla!" 😂
Being a kid who grew up loving to cook and taking every single food related course in my not-so-modern Missouri high school... Andrew, this made me cry. I wish someone had come along to do the things you did for those students. ❤
Hey wasn't that music the one from L4D2
"You guys like quesadillas?"
...
".. yes."
first glance at the thumbnail, i thought it was a new Baroness music video.
I miss Rashid, I squealed when he showed up in the roast beast video
Those kids did not seem impressed ahhaha but you made it work!!! 😅😅😅 can't wait to see rashid's vacay!!!
My heart swelled with love watching this.
Rashid and Andrew are the cutest couple on youtube
Hey Vsause Michael here
I saw the title only and thought it was a couples thing and I thought he was telling us Rashid was his boyfriend and I was like aww
10:01 Overwatch bag?!?
The biggest reason for me watching this series of you are the comfortable jokes
I’m from New Orleans and seeing Rashid’s reaction to his surprise made my heart full 😭
Hi Babish. I Love your channel so much. So many things learned and eventually mastered. These videos are amazing as well. Keep on keeping on Man. From an aspiring home chef in Cape Town, South Africa ✊🏽
MR. BABISH YOU CHEATED
SAWYER SHOWED NIPPLE AND YOU DID NOT D:<
Everybody owes everything to teachers.  I'll be forever grateful to mine.  Thought this was a great episode, loving this new series!
They're gonna make me cryyy. Babish is so sweet. 😭😭
12/10 would throw beads at Babish and Sawyer
Even Speedwagon is afraid of kids
also jfc Spider-verse is amazing, I know you guys loved it <3
beyond heart warming <3
Does Babish play Overwatch? If so what is his platform and username?
6:15 That student on the right definitely knew who you are.
Lol, if you really hated kids, you would've done the microwave version of quesadillas.
True teachers are the greatest
I didn't make it but I gain alot respect for them.
Why does he look like kratos in the thumbnail 😂
I see the Nintendo Switch in the background. You can’t hide that killer setup.
Is the cutting board on top of the oven necessary?
Is Vinny the Vinny from it's alive with Brad?
Thank you for this episode.
It’s so nice to watch Babish’s career flourish and to see him expand into different things!
gotta know who in bwb headquarters plays overwatch 10:03
You should collab with Gordon Ramsey
I just love everything about this episode!
you do anything else than cooking??
Okay
But like
Why couldn't the camera go lower
9:55 who noticed the overwatch backpack?
OH NO! your not very comfortable :/
2:59
“Get that n*gga out of here”
lets save and help kids by giving them  a network from which we can ensue their success. food is a right, not a privilege
Can we get highlights of them watching spiderverse? 😂😂
For a split second I thought this was Cooking with Kratos.
Is that an Overwatch backpack on the floor there, Babish?
Love this series!  Thanks for sharing these stories with us and continuing to make a difference!
That classroom smell is decomposing imagination.
Wow you got Woody Allen on your team
I want a smart oven! 😭 great episode babby! One of the best youtubes (and people) I've stumbled onto, I love it!
I'll never buy it, but that oven actually seems pretty dope.
I see Rashid, I click like. Simple as that.
I see your expensive lounge chairs Babish! Two of them! How decadent.
Came for the stripping thumbnail, stayed for the dilla’s.
*SNIFF SNIFF*DO I SMELL MARDID GRAS?!!!
Andrew, if you wanted a bigger reaction from a cooking class, crash mine instead cause I’d probably weep in the corner out of excitement
featuring... Vincent Cross? Nobody’s better than us Vinny
lol this reminds me of the time my high school literally had the boyband BLUE perform in the assembly hall to a collection of classes and not a single fork was given. The best part agreed by many was we got to skip math class that day.

I'm sure the quesadillas would have been worth crashing of the lesson.
We want footage of the trip offcourse!!! 💜 for u all!
Love the channel but have you ever thought about asmr ur voice would be perfect
Unreleased footage of hangover 3
Two wholesome donations in one video? You're amazing, man. These videos always start my day off great.
I live in New Orleans. This is amazing
Love what you do. I helped others after Katrina as well and know their need even today. Fantastic
Thought drake was in the thumbnail for a sec
Babish: "Ready to do some cooking?! :D"
Kids: " ..........yea... "
Babish: "Once everyone managed to calm down we broke out the new gear"   

Lmao, well Done Babish. Also, the balls on you for bringing a brass quartet into an apartment? I bet the neighbors loved it haha.
Smart baby, smart... 🌸
I gotta get some better friends lol
As someone from Louisiana, I immediately recognized those beads in the thumbnail as Mardi Gras beads lmao
hey babish i was thinking that you could do a one piece meal
I didn't knew Kratos would exitst,



where's your son?
This series is just lovely. Also - too short. Play around and let us see more! <3 (uh just realized that did not sound too well but you get my drift)
I'mma be honest....

No homo but Babish is pretty hot
You look so weird without your apron on

I feel this is why Mickey Mouse never takes off his gloves. You're the Mouse of cooking, congratulations.
Sexy AND kind?  Oh, and he cooks!  That's too much man!  I can handle it.  Marry me, Mr. Rea.
Thought it said radish, expected some Shokugeki type food, I don't have any complaints about this though
I clicked for the banish babish bait 😜😍
Daddy Babby, you're a teacher in your own right. You're the reason I made my first ever Beef Wellington, among so many other dishes, so thank you!
such an amazing episode, says a lot about you as a person and how valuable those friendships are. I find the work you do to be truly meaningful and thank you for sharing with us so it may become a part of our day. cheers to you sir.
Your the best man. 😎
Dude! It would be awesome to meet you, when y'all in NOLA.
Babish looking like Kratos in that thumbnail.
Please make a Team fortress Sandwich!
New meme review Series: Cringing with Babish
Banish: all around the globe!
Me: no f*cking Way you’re going to Australia!
Don't worry Andrew, even if those middleschoolers don't love you I do! <3
amazing job and this is become part of my inspiration babish 😁😁
I went back to school at the age of nearly 40 to become a middle school teacher & I just finished student teaching last week! Middle schoolers are crazy but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

(Also now I'm curious which high school Andrew & his friends went to since I know he's from Rochester thanks to the garbage plate video!)
This is a great new show idea man, love it.
Yay Rashid! I missed him dearly.
Good googily moogily they made Jian Yang's "Not hot dog" app
shirtless Babish in the thumbnail --> instant click
I'll be real these episodes have always somehow made me cry.. ;-;
First comment.







no actually i wasnt
Andrew, have you ever thought of doing a video with one of your favorite school teachers?
You are doing great work babish. You really appreciate that people cant cook like you but you keep it simple and it's great to watch you. Keep up the good work!
The Water Proof Bois will rise again!
YESSS RASHID IN A VIDEO AGAIN missed him hope he’s still doing well
You have a heart of gold 💖
sends thumbnail to Kobe Burger Salt Bae
Can you make the "so-call roast pork roll" from Food Wars! S1E1??? 🤤
Anyone else spot the Overwatch backpack!!!!!
I really enjoy this new format!
Great! Now I regret throwing away my (before unknown) pancake peaker 👀
Dude please try making "everything but the kitchen sink sunday" from geek charming.
I need to see that Hot Ones with Juju 😂
Hey baby I hear the blues a callin!! Tossed salad and scrambled eggs!!😭😭😭
um, their school is called . . . RIVERDALE um what ew
OMG Sawyer 😍😍😍😍😍
I am so proud of being part of the babish family and have had the opportunity to see you from when you were small to now taking us over the USA and the World. Seeing you accomplish some dreams you have set for yourself and ones you didn't know that you had yet lol. Keep up the good work bro and I hope you have a restaurant one day? And it includes all things you've made and will continue too :)
defo missed seeing Rashid in your videos! his reaction was everything!!
We got to see more of his tatoos in the end! GATEM
I sure hope the Water Proof reunion is filmed!
Rashid walks it, gets surprised, next shot, he's standing there all mic'd up.
Me: When did you have time to mic Rashid?
I'm starting to find these Being with babish videos really great .😁👌
4:04 You mean heavy perspiration and crayon stench?
So everybody got an apron, everybody but Andrew 😂
Somebody's really liking quesadillas lately...
8:42 (H)a(ir)ndrew Rey lol
How did you persuade Woody Allen to join your team?
You're doing an amazing thing Babi keep it up
You hired Vincenzo?! snaps applause
"Wtf is this?!"

Still throws it in the bag to give to the kids

Babish TRULY does hate kids.
3:52 Binging with Babish totally stole Vinchenzo from Brad!!
Im surprised the kids in that after school program werent more excited to get access to all of that brand new stuff. But hey, as someone about to be a teacher, sometimes kids are just.... odd. Lol 

Thanks for going out of your way to do something like this, even if Brooklyn isnt necessarily YOUR community, it's truly a beautiful and wonderful thing you have done here for those kids. 

As far as you surprising your old roomie with an AEP trip to New Orleans? Well.... let's just say we got plenty of salty eye water for any future recipes.
Would have liked to see more of the middle school cookin gclass
These episodes warm my heart so much
School full of POC. This is America :(
I love how not surprised the teacher and class were.
I'm putting the thumbnail from this video onto a T-shirt and never taking it off... 💓
so awesome yet so cringy lol love ya bro
Im gonna say it, yo thumbnail got me thinkin a new DLC for God of War just came on dude..
At any moment baldr could come and ask about what he's hiding
I wish i could cook this channel on a spoon nd inject it in my toe webbing 💚💚
That new intro never made me so happy for a youtuber before and their success
I challenge you to make холодец
RASHID ROCKIN' THAT PS4 PRO, DAAAMN
If I was a woman or a gay I'd hit on Daddy Babish so hard
Wait...
I can just say nohomo
Damn dude these are great keep killin it man
Even took the time to pick up a visitor pass! Gotta love Babby.
sureeee, only  2000pcs left :D
When and where can we watch the youtube unboxed video?
I swear it is Kratos in the thumbnail..😐
Could the bent spatula thing be a potato masher?
(Not sure how useful a plastic one would be)
I'm so happy they watched Spiderverse.   I still haven't seen it.
Binging With Babish has now gone entirely primal, next week hes going to show us how to cook mammoth on basics.
who clicked on this for the sexy thumbnail?
The feels!!!!!
26 seconds ye boi
New Orleans loves you Babish!
The beginning of this was so cringey I had to stop the video, and I was just watching it as background noise.
I love spatula related humor, it really picks me up!
Wow thanks for making me emotional
I thought a crazy dude was shouting in the thumbnail.
Why is every bald guy a literal legend?
RASHIDOOOOOOOOOOOO
So vinny and Babs knew each other all along
Awww i wish i had friends. Mostly to have someone to watch game of thrones with me other than my mom. I have simple needs.
Lil' Girl: watch me destroy this bald guy's whole career
7:04
I kept thinking this was a god of war parody because of the thumbnail
im in brooklyn you shouldve just come to my highschool i wouldve been SO HYPE
This video finally explained the tattoo on your upper right arm. It's one of the x-codes from Hurricane Katrina. You are a beautiful human being.
I’m in middle school and I wish you this happened that’d be lit
Bruhh these kids be trippin HOE TF DO THEY NOT KNOW WHO U ARE
10:45 Smooth high-five rejection recovery.
I almost read the title as "Surprising Radish"  lol
Oh god I see Vinny in the description box! tears up So proud haha
You are going places man.  Also you should do a scooby doo shaggy sandwich episode.
RASHID IS TOO PURE FOR THIS WORLD
You. Deserve. This. ❤
If you like this comment you have beig pepe
1:45 ....yes, your one and only doppelganger  - Michael from VSauce  -Simon from Today I Found Out      etc etc
Can you do a video on hot pot from one punch man?!
0:32 that shot just makes my man crush on babish even bigger
I always get emotional when I think about good people being good people.
We live in an amazing but incredibly difficult world. Growing up is hard because we are in a constantly changing climate, and I firmly believe that we are in the midst of a harder than usual time to grow up. With the social and political climates as they are, it's so hard to know what you are anymore, and being young and impressionable makes that even harder.
Youth depression is at an all-time high, and it's getting worse.
However, teachers like these gentlemen make a world of a difference. I was lucky with those who taught me a dozen years ago, so I know how important it is.
Bless them for being true to what they love, and making the lives of these kids that much easier.
Bless you, Andrew and crew, for showing them that someone appreciates what they do.
Much love.
Damn Babish almost seems human with this series. All jokes aside, great series and channel keep up the great work!
What dirty fascist bastard would thumbs down this video? Great job Andrew
It’s really cool that this is right in time for teacher appreciation week. Love you back Babish
The reaction of that girl at 6:16 was priceless, lmao
Nola?! Really! I love you more now!
Tough crowd 😅
Came for the beard, stayed for the epic voice over 🐇 oh, yeah and the food too
The sheet of broccoli going into the smartoven at the end was partially crooked and I swear that's going to haunt me till the end of my days.
Start planning the Halloween episode.  Your costume assignment: Kratos from God of War.
When Sawyer took his shirt off I lost it :)
BLOGS WE NEED BLOGS OF TGE TRIP
I'm the CTO of multi-million dollar corporation.  Before that I was a middle school and high school science and engineering teacher.  ...  Teaching was harder.
That is one capable oven, but can it also do my old high school homework?
Dude you legit have the exact kind of humour as me 😂 If I was there in front of these kids I'd make the same jokes 😛
Only here to take a peak of the shirtless Babish 🥴
This one didnt make me cry. But still solid. Ur da best babish.
He'd make the best kratos cosplay
You need to bring JuJu onto the show lol.
Oh hey, I teach middle school too! :D I love it!
Weird seeing babish's hair🤣🤣
That thumbnail made Andrew look like Rick Ross
I love how the “Alright we made it to... I’m comfortable how about you?”  Line has turned into a running gag 😁
HAHAH you sweat more then me when I have to talk to a crowed
If that thumbnail isn’t me on my Wedding day and every honeymoon after, then I’ve done something wrong
Oh shit I'm super early
Make The Burger and fries on that one scene where peter was supposed to teach miles how to swing
video got stuck on like 240pp so SMART OVEN looked like it said SHART OVEN. help.
Yay! I’ve been wondering what happened to Rasheed. Great to see him again !
officially the best Channel and content out there ..
Kratos thumbnail made me double take.
Had me like, "BOY."
Always good to see Vinny
Wait so is Vinny the same camera that was working with Brad from Bon Appétit?
Great episode! Great nod to teachers, too. I work in the Rochester City School District (as an AV tech, not a teacher), and you're bang on, teachers have a crucial job. Love the videos & production, keep up the awesome work!
So how much do Andrews neighbors hate him for the band?
10:01 overwatch backpack PogU
Fangirling over seeing Vinny in action. 🥰
In your next video say "Remember, a meal without kosher salt, is never a whole meal"
4:03 NO BABY BABBIES ONE DAY?!
Anyone here wants to see Babish do an episode on Sea Salt Ice Cream from Kingdom Hearts
I'm not kidding I thought the thumbnail is a picture of Kratos
Could have sworn the thumbnail was Mr. T.
Babish, watched you since the jump. Honesty man besides the really cool original concept, you seem like a really cool guy. I hope the success continues. Ill be here watching.
Hi vinny !!!! Aaaaa!!!!
What? Somebody with the same name as me?
I know I know. But a lil gay on the intro.
This is what I wish my life was but never will be lol.
Ready for my daily dose of feels.
The comfortable running gag gets me every time not gonna lie
Delightfully underwhelming
Babish, I have to say our of all of the cooking shows I’ve found on YouTube you and Brad Leone seem like the most genuine people ever love the content!
Where my NOLA gang at?!?!
Bald people are the best teachers. Well most of my math teachers were bald.
When you getting a TV show!?
You might not be in a classroom but your a teacher too ❤️
Babish buys a drone. Babish makes a series where he can use said drone for aesthetic shots
Real question, is Binging With Babish gay?
Did you get a smart oven?
It's weird, when this series was released, i was like, eh, probably not for me, but cool.
Yet here i am, watched and enjoyed every episode. Love you man
You should do Aunt Bee's pickles!
Banish going to have his own Cooking TV Show also can’t wait for Cobra Kaki Season 2
The thumbnail...
Cried the whole damn show!
why does every being with bab end with me in tears?!?! dammit babish!
Should've made him mac salad for nostalgia
i wish i had a teacher like that
one of those kids is gonna watch his Regular Show episode in a few months and really feel silly then xD
Every episode is an instant classic so far, beautiful job Babish!
This video made me smile the whole way through. +++
ITS VIINNNNNYYYY AAAAAGGGGGHHHGGHHHHHGGH
Make the Mississippi queen from Regular Show
An oven that will detect what you're cooking and cook it accordingly seems almost counter intuitive to a cooking class, but still remarkably wholesome. 
Keep it up Babby! You're inspiring new chefs every day, and with this new series you're inspiring people to become better every day.
And. Subscribed.
Damnit, Babish. Could you be any nice?
keep posting these are awesome
God, why do i feel genuine love and admiration for this man and this channel? Also, since this is Rasheed's first summer in 10 years, wouldn't he have already booked a nice trip away? 😅
i've become too use to seeing food titles on this channel, thought the title was suprise radish
Make the Mississippi queen from regular show
As someone who suffered through Katrina, a mother and soon to be teacher, laissez le bon temps rouler and thank you.
Is that an Overwatch backpack leaning against the wall at 9:54? And if so, whose is it?
Awesome already love this series
Hey Babish, for the basic "binging" series you should recreate the bell peppers and beef bowl from Cowboy Bebop
oh i didnt know you gutted houses in New Orleans. i live right outside of N.O.
“He’s used to me being weird.”😂😂 Love what you guys did here. You’re channel is awesome!
What a wonderful episode. I extend this to my friend Ana who is currently in her exam to be an elementary teacher. She has some difficulties to cope with the requirements but will not give up. So this episode i will extend the thank you to include her and all other teachers (in Training) as well.
if it involves Rashid it makes me happy
while you guys are in new Orleans we need a jambalaya episode
thought this was a kratos cosplay video from the thumbnail
Morimoto genuinely seems like the man
In memory of Andrew's hair
gachiHYPER
This is a really nice show. It always feels so wholesome
You look like DJ Kaled in the thumbnail lmao
I watched this whole damn video just to see Babish shirtless. I didn’t really get the full shot, but, I wasn’t disappointed. Consistently good content.
Im in middle school (7) and i know bout u
Oprah-babish is very entertaining and very genuine.  I love it!
Wholesome as always. Have you thought of ever making lomo saltado from Peru? I think you would kill it
If kratos ever became the god of cooking :
His voice Satisfying
I’m not crying you’re crying. 😂
Lol! I know the trumpet player! Wassup jimmy hahaha. For anyone who’s curious, the bands IG is @hungrymarchband
Someone... someone taught Babish how to create clickbait xD

Edit after the video: great show!
This product brings the mind of having an Alton Brown collaboration since he's a proponent of multi-taskers. Thrown in some Kelsey Grammer,  tossed salads and scrambled eggs for good measure.
that guy looks liek bernard from westworld
Yo. Damn. I remember my mom as school teacher too, and i dont give much appreciation to her career. This brought me to tears and understood how my mom bust her ass off trying to survive our life in a teachers salary. 

More power to your channel dude. My love to yours all the way from Manila . Cheers
Those kids probably didnt give a damn at first but kids are kids. They will remember your contribution.
first (no view club wru @)
Til this day the ps4 is still on rest mode
I want bros like Andrew has bros.
You should make a seperate channel Being with babish
Awww I cried a bit. so wholesome!
Raving with Rashid ,make it happen babish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RELISHING WITH RASHID for a show idea for him.
Does anyone think Babish should go to MasterChef World? I think he can win it!
Babish looks like a bald, hotter Nick Jonas. Definitely into it though.
any one know where you can find Waterproof?
This is truly a beautiful series. I sincerely hope this keeps going
Andrew you are hope.
You should do a vid on homemade fig bars, I’d love to see it!
Rashid's reaction is priceless.
I'm sure this ain't the same guy but I swear I remember someone named Sean Connolly trying to convince me jews are evil on facebook
5:19 that good sir is a whang-jangler
What did you do for those beads babish. 


What did you do for those beads.
It just occured to me that you took the babisj movements from the swuareslace ad slot with the finger swiprs and taps and just rrolacrd the omagrs  and thr voicrover
You can’t help but love these LOVELY gentlemen!
my first time watching being with banish and i really loved this
Wow new subs here 😉 I love your channel !
Morimoto was on hawai five O once right?
"I've never thrown a party before" me neither babish. me neither
u put the broccoli in sideways
This week's installation of Ballin' with Babish
Best series on YouTube at the moment!
This feels a lot like, our footage at the school didn't work how the hell do we fix this?
I am waiting for you to make a video called bitchin with Babish about overrated vs underrated foods
So you mean to tell me that you were in my city for a time before you started to cook on Youtube and stuff??? and you love it here?!?!? COME BACK 


Edit: I commented that before getting to the part where you said YOU'RE COMING
Cant wait for "Beekeeping with Babish"
Holy poopy he called the camera Vinny! Shout out to Brad from the test kitchen
Home Ecing with Babish?
Yo!  That oven is an entire mood!  I just sent an email to them linking this vid.  I'm an interior decorator.  Such relevant!
Could you make an episode where you show your tattoos?
You're dad was a professor? What did he teach or do man?
Anyone else remember waterproof?
Best flop sweat ever when confronted with a classroom full of middle-schoolers. Thanks for giving teachers a bit of the love and respect they deserve.
I'm in middle school so I know you
"I don't like kids" haha
>I dont like children -babish

mfw you're a kid and Andrew doesnt like you :(
Whoaaa I just had a total "small world moment" because I'm like 90% sure Mr. Conley was my 7th grade science teacher when he used to teach in MA! How weird is that??
Usagi Tsukino once referred to school as the “halls of torture.” She’s still right, 20+ years later.
6:58 guess we know the age range of who watches Binging with Babish.
My sister being a LAUSD teacher this episode really hit the heart. Good looking out 👍 BABISH.
Edible 👏 fugu 👏 is 👏 not 👏 poisonous👏
seeing the thumbnail reminded me of kratos. I didn't know that i need to see a god of babish
No views, 58 likes....YouTube drunk at work again
Im not sure if i like being whit babish....🤔🤔😐
"I don't like kids" said everybody ever.
You’re an amazing human ❤️
The legendary Vinni is with Babish?
no views? I'm a ninja!!
This was so pure and sweet
8:43 Andrew without the beard?! Now you are making me look at how much my own appearance changed in 13 years. 😮
Do a video making a prison burrito
No views but already has 40 comments when i watched this 😂😂😂
how do I contact you guys for a being with babish recommendation
I could listen to that deep voice all day. 🙂🙂🙂
For real. As a teacher, thank you. Our salaries are 31% lower than that of other professionals with an undergraduate degree, yet I work extra time almost every day, every weekend, and most summers not just to make ends meet but to be there for our kids.

My husband and I currently can't afford to buy a house or start a family of our own partly because I chose to follow my dream of being a music teacher, and between some parents, administrators, politicians, and sometimes even our own families not understanding the demands on our profession, it's good to know there are people out there who appreciate us.

Thank you.
Am i the only one who thought he was doing Kratos cosplay from the thumbnail?
have you ever been to Ausrailia
When I was teaching, High School was my preference- you can be yourself
Love these videos soooo much 💙
Nacho hat from the Simpsons
Welcome back Rashid. We've been expecting you.
2:05 This could potentially be the real life Death Sandwich
Hey man you got to buy a supercar!!
Damn Babish stole Vinny from Brad :(
I feel like it would be totally amazing and pure if you were to fly and cook with Grandpa kitchen and cook for all the kids in the village
Babish you are a one in a life time youtuber who is able to make a difference. thank you for always making everyone's week better.
Binging with Babish: doesn't like kids


Also Binging with Babish: has a youtube channel
Make the Mississippi queen from regular show
Is Babish gay?.... Idc. Just curious.
I thought it was Kratos is the thumbnail
That’s crazy, the middle school where I teach social studies in the Bronx is that EXACT layout and everything of that building. Inside and out that’s crazy
I'm i the only one that really wanna watch that  documentary  he talked about. ?
that tilted broccoli tray at 13:33 screws with my head a bit
I read the title as “surprising radish” LMAO
WHY DID YOU STEAL VINNY
generic early comment to get likes
To be honest that first teacher didn't that enthusiastic that you were even there. The principal seemed more interested that you were there doing work for his students. Maybe the teacher was just in shock, who knows. But if that dude was a real fan, he'd be showing those kids Basics With Babish episodes and recreating the recipes. Kinda makes me sad that he wasn't that thrilled. That's just my perspective
Is that Vinny? THE Vinny? The Vinny from It's Alive?
5:43 earn that paycheck babish
Had to do a triple take on babish with hair!
The last time I came this early my sister got pregnant
The surprised interrupted narration when you realized he was already in the doorway was glorious.
That thumbnail 😂
Brad gave him Vinny???
10:05 is that an overwatch bag
FIRST
my favorite and least favorite thing about kids is that theyre super unimpressed by everything
But did you watch Spider-Verse?
Ugh currently sobbing again!
10:37 boogie2988????
You have taught me to cook many amazing dishes babish and for that i thank you
You definitely surprised me
Why do I keep crying in all of these
do some of the 77 sandwiches from the episode roamin’ Bob-iday on bobs burgers
It should have been called Bashing with Babish
You should try to make popplers from Futurama?
ohhh so that explains your first videos
It's funny the way older folk try to avoid the cameras, but younger folk now consider it normal to go into insta or YT mode as soon as a camera appears
It's a masher not a right angled spatula. A weird one though.
I want to see all the takes of Andrew ripping his shirt off. And Sawyer. And the full shots, not this final tease that you decided on, pff. Nips or it didn't happen. 😅😘
I’ve always wanted to be a teacher and recently I’ve had to give up school and take a second job to help around the house and this episode mf HIT MEEEEEE
this is so friggin wholesome
Just being real, this whole video seemed like a big circle jerk about how great you are.
Okay but when’s the New Orleans video
We all came here to see Andrew topless getting beads thrown at him ... robbed.
Imagine if babish came to my school ;-;
Waterproof Bois 🌊
Here I am ten days away from graduating high school and questioning my Babish isn't teaching me how to cook
omfg im dying, those kids are so.... mean... not excited at all omg
You seem so nervous around those kids.
U remind me of my dad
damn, those kids got AC in a non computer room?!
being high and watching this makes it all more wholesome
I saw a band on Monday and the lead singer looked like Ralph Machio.
Super cool video!! I love Rashid's reaction and he really deserves it 👏👏. I hope y'all will do some vlogs of the trip!!

Not to be a downer on this sponsored content, but I remember years ago Ashton Kutcher was an early stage investor in the JUNE OVEN and he spoke about it on a bunch of talk shows. This one by Whirlpool looks like a very similar knock-off with identical features to be bluntly honest.
Andrew your such a weird guy. But a weird guy with great content.
I’m sure Radish was excited to see you!
10:02 I see that OW backpack👀
When you would love Babish to surprise you, but you don't have any friends (to nominate you)... haha
Holy shit! It's Woody Allen! Did Soon Yi let him out of her basement?
THIS IS SO GREAT!
please do a hoodwinked too episode ily
That thumbnail tho 😍😍
god this series is so wholesome.
Ari looks like a young Woody Allen.
I'd love to watch Spiderverse with you Andrew
6 minutes in and i just realised there is no radish involved
8:43 HAIRRRR
fantastic as always
Is that a Fema Tatoo on your right bicep?
I just saw Babish shirtless, I can die happy now
You need to make the sandwiches from benchwarmers.
Yay for teachers! Noo for the beads!! Please reuse of possible. Andrew watch a clip of "Mardi Gras: Made In China" those beads are the product of 10cents an hour :'(
When I saw the title I was like holy ganache balls he knows my name!
Can we watch that doco about New Orleans?
My god that thumbnail
- I'm taking summer off for the first time ever in my ten year career.
- We're taking you to New Orleans for a water proof reunion!
- Hey ... er  ... I have plans. I mean ... first time in ten years - you think I didn't plan something?? ... :D
You looked like Kratos in the thumbnail
This was absolutely beautiful
Do the larry david sandwich if you can
THATS MY HISTORY TEACHER WTF
This is the best thing I’ve ever watched
Did anyone notice Andrew with HAIR????
I am a professional bartender and bar manager in Panama, if you come here I would really love to have you as a guest in my bar for a demonstration or a show, I really liked you bar essentials episode and a think you could do a more in depth follow up. Thanks

P.D.: I really love you channel you and my grandma are the ones who inspired me to study culinary arts
I need some help with alcohol replacements for dishes. Could you list them in the description when you’re using it in a video?
laughs in middle school teacher
666k views?  oh no
Babish dont forget you are a teacher as well and what you do for people is just as awesome
Why does Andrew know so many good looking dudes??
Binging with Kratos

While everyone settled down oh andrew the humor 😂
You look much better bald.
I was waiting for Rashid!!!!!
Too bad they dont ship internationally.
ha ha you and those kids, best episode yet
Rashid? Already liked
School looks like something outta the damn Vatican
I see dat overwatch bag
Babby is literally me when talking to kids. So stiff and awkward lmao.
"Being with Babish" could be a mini series of guided meditations you do. Just a thought I had while I was out of the country.
That thumbnail is art.
I kinda want vlogs from the new orleans.
RA-SHID-OOOOO
Babish becoming the new Mr. Beast
Youre a rockstar man
If it makes you feel better I'm in middle school and know who you are
10:04 saw that overwatch bag in the back
What was the name of the song when they were going upstairs? That was dope.
Why does the thumbnail look like a shot from god of war 4
5:50 when the oven talks lmao
I love this series!!!
Not gonna lie, we might need to get married
The overwatch backpack though
1:48 JuJu's bizarre adventure
That overwatch bag tho
YES DAD!
it's $799 for the smart oven if anyone's wondering.
Yoo sick overwatch backpack at 9:55
Haha this was the most realistic reality show ever.
So thats where Vinnie went.. Watching brad isnt the same :(
I hope the kids appreciated the cooking lesson and watched his videos
As a New Orleanian away from home your surprise was cliche in all the right ways. It brought a tear to my eye.
Mr. Rea you may not realize it but you are a teacher as well.  You have taught millions of all ages to cook and more so to enjoy cooking, myself included.
I thought the thumbnail was DJ Khaled
Hey how did u get Woody Allen to come work with you? I never knew he played video games either. Who knew?
This was so DOPE
Girls trip: babish edition
OMG He said spatula humour! He's seen the cartoon! The one with all the manatese dangling from the ceiling
VINNY
i cant choose what do i want. do i want to teach cooking or too be a cook what the benefits of cooking adnthe benefits of being a culinary teacher
9:30 you beautiful hairy beast
My friends don’t even text me back
Probably one of your best episodes.  Love this new series for sure.   I have a couple middle schoolers, a boy and a girl and they would have given the same reactions... LOL
I love, love, love this show!
Thanks for the shout out to all those great teachers.  Myself being one of them that is deep in the trenches, this episode came at just the right time.  Your show matters...not just to me personally, but to everyone who watches.  You were already a teacher... I'm glad to see you finally be able to meet your students.  Keep teaching!  Cheers!
Sluzzle Tag special on January please?????
so we’re all skipping over the fact that that man’s god-given name is sean connelly? cool.
Awesomeness as always bruh
Hey! I live in New Orleans! Let’s hang out
Stop making me teary omg
Vinny is everywhere
NANI DID I JUST SEE THE FAMOUS CHEF MOTO MOTO
2006. Back when babbie had hair lol
The Iron chef was wearing a Panerai
So is vinny the same vinny that brad leone used to have as his camrea person
Best one yet.
its coo to hate schoo
Please post Water Proof Andrew.
Why don't you snobb it down a fair bit and risk fawning a greater audience? Too upper middle class??
Babish looked like big show in the thumbnail
more rashid please!
The funny thing is, that you also teach. You teach cooking, online.   even if you dont like children, my children like you. They think your jokes are funny and they always want to do your recipes.
Wait what you the one that host the hots one wow
Is it possible to get one of those BWB aprons?
Love it!❤️
How did you get down there, Vinny?!
As a science teacher myself this was very heart felt and uplifting. The classroom often doesn't pan out that way you imagine it will (even as a seasoned teacher) kids are hard to win over but honestly I think you did eventually as these kids clearly got into it. Also props to Mr Conley for providing a valuable opportunity for these kids - very inspirational.
the teacher didn't impressed..
Tough crowd
dat thumbnail is life
8:21 i wish babish wore a wolverine costume during this
So when are you doing a NYC meetup? Too many fans that live less than ten miles away from you for you not to do a meetup!
Babish HAS BECOME THE GOD OF WAR KRATOS!
yeah...
You are not kid person xD
my man
I loved this video man
VINNY!!!
Day 3 of asking banish to do Big Bang burger from persona 5
I was under the impression we'd see a shirtless Babs...Did I miss something?
...he’s not watched spider-verse yet
Is babish gay?
we wanted to bust in on you
Best. Video. EVER!
THAT LAST NOTE AT 10:44 IS AMAZING
He looks like kratos in the thumbnail
Babish going on Hot Ones???
Kudos bro
OML I HAVE A CHANCE OF SEEING BABISH THIS SUMMER
These episodes keep me going.
Middle school science teacher here!!! Loved this. Thank you so much for investing in an educator who invests in others everyday!
We have finally seen Vinny
I came here for the thumbnail
New York looks so claustrophobic.
9:26 hol up
Look Imma be honest, this is nice. There are some incredible teachers out there who will take a step up and go out of their way to help kids in need.

But

There are also teachers who act like they should get a nobel peace prize because they were 'so gracious' as to let you finish an assignment during a lunch block.

Just saying you can never fully encompass a group of people/people in occupations as being totally one thing. 

But for the people featured in tjis video were some real gems.
Do you get to keep an oven too?. :D
Chanko nabe?
As a trainer in a call center, his message moved me.
Rashids got a bomb
Please do the foods from Dexter next episode of Binging with Babish!
I love being with babish this make me :)
We all need a friend like Babish...
I just know babish has a BWC 🥴.
Yo Andrew, I saw pic with you holding a rifle and I was hoping we could have a little series called Breaching with Babish. That would fucking awesome since you look operater asf. Consider it.
I thought this said “Surprising Radish”
I came here for shirtless Babish.. i've been dooped.
Being with Babish? Instant like.
Babish brings his baggage.  afterthoughts Oh, this stuff is not going to travel easily. :) Excellent try, stumble, learning moment for everyone. Kudos to teachers.
chicken nugget
1:22 is that Nikki from Buzzfeed?
Gei
is that an Audi?
Babish is like the dad of student chefs
I'd love to see waterproof if you still have the files babish, also I love the waterproof boys
Anyone every tell you that you sound kinda like bob from Bob’s  Burgers
Interesting to watch on my birthday…
I don't miss those stairs a bit lol
Isn't it interesting when you're young in school you're like "meh just my teachers," but as an adult if someone offered you a teacher by your side, let a long a group of teachers, throughout the day you'd think you won the lottery?
Thank you, thank you, thank you for showing teachers appreciation! Those kids and hundreds (dare I say thousands) to come will benefit from your generosity and recognition of what fantastic work is being done to teach them about nutrition and how to cook for themselves!!!
Babish had two PS4s and a Switch
being with babish? more like bankrupting babish.  Jeez how does even afford all this lol.
Please please make the ‘Grand-slamwhich’ from Charlie teh unicorn. (The is supposed to be misspelled)
Please, can I please organize your space?
I love this new show so much
Use me as a 'release water proof in full' button
damn, he's kind and handsome argh
Being with banish.  Sounds like a nice date
When did Babbie snatch Vinnie from Brad?
Love the show  Babish!
Hey Babish, I recommend trying to cook Kabsa, It's an Arabian rice meal, and It's the most famous food in Saudi Arabia, I'm a Saudi subscriber, I'll be happy if you cook kabsa in the traditional way and your way, thanks.
5:19 it’s a pimblokto leg :(
So inspirational.  I love this series. Good on ya! (Yeah, I don’t know where that came from either lol, I’m American {as opposed to NZ or Aus where they might actually say something like that}) thisisgettingweirdimdonenowokbye
CCCCCRINGE
Bab I hope you make it.
You must work a lot don't you? How many hours do you sleep?
I want that oven I honestly love cooking and would like to experiment with it tbh
A few years back I decided I wante dto be an art teacher. I want to be the teacher I didn't get to have in /middle/highschool. 

I'm still working on getting the degree I need to be able to teach art, but a friend of mine is an art teacher and he asked me to guest teach a couple of his classes. We had to do it over skype and streams because I'm a world away. But talking to these kids, hearing how excited they were but also tackling to difficulty of keeping their attention was....Amazing. 

It set in stone that it's what I want to do. I have a huge amount of respect for some of the teachers I had in school, especially since the class I was always put in was the 'problem' children. The ones with attention problems and mental illnesses or that the education system just gave up on. I so want to be a teacher that in 20 years another adult goes 'I'd really like to be like her, she made school better'
Dude!
How about a chicken meatloaf with lemo accent like the one in Carthay Circle?
9:51 Babish had hair
Hey if you need a guide in Nola I got you
4:03 when your mom goes to your school event
That thumbnail though!!!
Good form Sir !
Could you come to my school in Maryland??? We need you there MONTGOMERY VILLAGE MIDDLE SCHOOL 💖💖💖
haft expected atlest one kid to go omg is that babish
does he not know hes a food teacher
You can tell just how awkward being back at school is making him feel.
I'm sure Babish gets all the proper permissions for stuff like this but I like imagining that he just barged into the school and just took over this poor man's class.
Is that the same Vinny from it’s alive with Brad????
"Headed back to the school to start what would be a heroin journey." Oh my god, he's really gonna teach them kids to cook with what they can find in or just outside their local corner shop. :/
Morimoto always seemed like such a cool guy.  I originally got interested in cooking from watching him battle other chefs at like 2am on the Japanese version of Iron Chef (with the dubbed-in English for the announcers, watch it if you've never seen it before, because it's brilliant.) I haven't had the chance to go to any of his restaurants yet (despite living in NY when he opened Morimoto's in Philly,) but next time I'm back in NY I'm definitely visiting.
Still disappointed Vinny isn't with Brad anymore
These are so wholesome and I love it
why would they only make 2000 ovens? they are sitting on a gold mine
has heart attack well this is awkward
did babish just cure my depression?
Can you make naruto  ramen
Who's better than us, Vin?
Surely I’m not the only one who wants that spot popped at 3:44?
U should do a dumpling video
He looks like kratos in the thumbnail
He should do a food wars special
You look like you could be a high school math teacher
Do taco town from snl
How would you feel about a series called Banging with Babish where we engage in some menage a trois? Or we could just bang to some good music.
Can you do your own version of How Ones?
Banish you are a teacher and you inspire the hundreds of thousands of people that watch your videos. You deserve just as much thanks as any other teacher.
Kids, man
I read that as surprising radish and I was just... so confused.
Ngl, idk about everyone else but when I saw the thumbnail I instantly thought “Hey look it’s God of War” XD
13:33 He fuckd up
Dude ur the weird person who comes in for talks and has no idea how to talk to children
13:32 I'm I the only one who noticed he slid that in wrong
Bruh, you shoulda called me up im in St.Martinville, i could have played baritone with you guys
Would love to won something like this but odds are never in my favor so ill just have to be content sitting here trying to be happy because other people are...
lil biggie yung babish
Is it just me or was this episode kind of weird? The first two were Andrew surprising a fan that's been having a rough time or something like that, then they cook, eat talk and gift.
This one on the other hand was like minimal communication with the fan (if he was that) the gifts to a close friend instead?
I'm not even criticising, I'm just baffled.
Omg those middle schoolers need to calm down!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Not until this episode did I fully notice how much Babish looks like skinny Kratos.
Anyone else getting a Kratos vibe here?
OOOh, that's why it's an educational channel. Sneaking Babish, tricking me through entertainment.
Kratos?
Kratos?
Please make the "Berliner Batzen"!
It's a creation of the Space Frogs. The german YouTube channel from Rick and Steve who combined meatballs, Currywurst with fries and kebap!
It doesn't matter how fit you are if you walk up the stairs to the 4th floor your gonna be tired
Surprised that the school do not have an elevator. Looks very tiring scaling 4 floors with seemly heavy things.
Brad is quaking.
13 years! yeeeeeeeet
Waitttt, who plays over watch 10:01, that back pack
Hopefully a Being with Babish with Strictly Dumpling about Chinese Food soon!
Kratos?
8:42 Is that... hair? and a patchy beard?
This is very wholesome
I thought the kids would be more enthusiastic
Can we talk about how amazing the opening credits to Being with Babish is ? Those well placed slow-mo <3
10:36 Is that Boogie second from the left?
So shiny... must touch head...
10:10 If your friend isn't used to you being weird is it really a friendship?
12:58
Can you post the water proof footage?
Looks like kratos
I always end up catching these episodes while in in dialysis treatment.  Let me tell you, while I've certainly been through worse (22 hour surgery to remove rare tumor, multiple amputations, etc), dialysis isn't exactly a ball of sunshine. (with some days being worse than others) Binging (and now, Being) with Babish has become a regular part of my time-killing methods of choice while trying to pass the four hours.  So, in addition to thanking all the teachers that have made a difference in my life, thanks to Andrew and the crew for making a fine show that helps to pass the miserable time. 🙂
1:32 did...did he just soak his fries?
8:06
I don't get it.
wait you just drop by and be like "hey i got hundreds of dollars worth of equipment for you there ya go!" and he just looks like you reluctantly gave him a piece of gum...
there is never enough spatula humor...
Coming soon:  Binging On Babish.  Zombies eat Babish's head!
I have a great respect for you mr.babish
Babish looks like Kratos lite on the thumbnail.
Thoroughly cringey
I guess that school never got the ADA memo.....
Babish, why do I have feeling that I would bump into you in NYC one day?
8:43 Baby faced Babish
The poor neighbors.
i need the thingy that the girl used to grab the quesadilla at 8:05
How dare you advertise nice things that I really want but cant afford
Kratos Babish thumbnail
3wholesome5me
6:44 they're missing out
As a former substitute teacher, I can attest that teaching middle school students is a nightmare. And kind of fun in a sick and twisted sort of way.
feels corporate, didn't like this one babish
So, nobody is going to talk about shirtless babish..?
Was that Vinny?!?
Teachers are great and terribly underpaid.
fish
Its like the weirdest version of School of Rock imaginable. Like at the end, they end up on Iron Chef instead of Battle of the Bands, and a middle schooler is screaming about eggs.
Sorry babish, but I only watched in hopes to see you shirtless.
You wanna surpize me???
Wow... throwing your money away.
How tf does a school teacher afford a place like that, teachers are extremely under paid.
How about the Lobster Themidor from the Lego Batman Movie?
YOUR CAMERAMAN IS NAMED VINNY TOO?
I am teacher and thoroughly enjoy what I do. I greatly appreciate your kind words about the profession. It certainly isn't for everyone.
Are you gay andrew?
I read ‘surprising radish’ cuz it rhymes with banish
Was hoping for more skin
Suuuss
vinny at 3:03
soggy it is
U need a suv so badly
new Orleans vlog?
Thought this was a God of war videos till I saw the title
thor kills iron man
babish. this was so good
suckkkk myyy penniiissss
Babish can you make an entire video testing out what the smart oven can recognize?
“What’s up vinnie”
I love spider verse! I got my build a bear bunny a Spider Gwen costume
Patato masher
That oven is cool... but it's not $799 cool.
I love new Orleans.
as much as i am sad that i dont get this treatment from babish im happy that my life isnt that bad. the worst thing in my life so far was a housefire but we were insured and got back more stuff than we were expecting. glad he can help people when they need it the most.
i read the title as ‘surprising radish’
Just a dash of Scott's Tots.
being with babo
Not afraid to say that I replayed that airplane feeding like 6 times and I was rooting for you all six times
They might not know it now, but you changed some lives with this one, Babby. There are definitely a few of these kids who are going to wake up one day and realize they really want to cook and when they look back, they're going to trace it back to this teacher, this classroom, this equipment, even this day specifically.
Kids being shown tools that they can't afford to cook meals they can't afford.
its so awesome hearing that y'all came down to help during katrina. i lived in baton rouge during both katrina and the 2016 flood in baton rouge. seeing the whole state pull together to help with tons of support from other states is one of the most heartwarming things 'ive ever seen and the reason ill always be in louisiana. thank you guys and cant wait to have y'all back in NOLA. this time to enjoy the sights and foods of this great state!
Cringing with Babish
this was so great!!
This is one for people who think YouTube isn’t a “real job”
Putting babish and middle schoolers against each other in cooking is like putting a heavyweight champion against a 3rd grader in a fight
This video came out just a week after the massive teacher funding cuts that caused tons of teachers at my high school to be laid off
oooo next can we get "Biology with Babish" where Andrew just becomes a middle school biology teacher? I loved seeing him interact with bored middle schoolers
Vem är Rashid?
Babish if I can request a food to make you should make the Wings for real men from regular show or wing kingdom wings I think it’d be good
Ahhhhh Babish, if you plan on having a meet up down in Nola, I would love to come to it! I'll be moving to a small town just across the bridge!
Yes?
Vinny? Where's Brad?
anyone else read the title "Surprising Radish..."?
5:19 its a potato masher
Adorable
How I see it, YouTube red Worthy. Surprised it’s actually not a Red Series Tbh. But tbh it’s binge worthy series I look forward to watching for a while.
ARI IS CUTE .....DANGGGGGGGGG!
Kind of want to see Babbish as Kratos in a live action movie...
What chump could down vote you? Damn trolls
Where can you nominate someone for 'Being with Babish'?
I'm a teacher at a non-mainstream school, and the moment where you first addressed the class is a situation I have been in many times. It can be kind of difficult to get the kids interested in cooking a dish, even if it's something they have asked to do. It all kind of comes together when there's that "click" moment where you first show them how to butterfly a chicken breast, or how to properly cut an onion (I believe I learned both from this channel), and everyone works in unison to make a good dish to be eaten at lunchtime. The moment where you get the attention or respect of a class is a good one, and for something practical, like cooking, you can certainly see where they go from actually wanting to take part, rather than just being there because they have to be there.
Who Presses The Like Button Before Even Watching The Being With Babish Episode?
I live in Louisiana.
But when will we get the Binging with Babish Podcast, Bitching with Babish?
as a person who started watching you in my school years I can say safetly that everyone in my school knows who you are so to hear that none of those kids knew you is weird...
Was anyone else surprised to see an over watch bag in babbie’s recording room?
How does he make so many of these so fast
are you going to hot ones
Babish I think I saw you in Clinton Hill the other day! Sorry if I stared, I was trying to figure out if it was you haha.
@5:15 it's a potato masher.
Chicos tacos recipe please
i would have been so happy if he’d came to my school.
damn babish is making moves
Damn I hate middle schoolers
9:24 that hits me deep
Will there be a calm erotic show of Babish taking a bath called bathing with babish?
I said it once and I’ll say it again, Babish is God.
ʸᵉᵃʰ
Wait. Babish had hair?
show me your bewbs
So wholesome
hi bald vsauce!
we need a new series called bitching with babish where he just sits and talks for like 15 minutes about how he hates children .
Damn, Babish has got himself some nice digs.
Vinny as in Vincenzo vinny? Is Babby working with Vinny??! If this is the case how did I miss this
I’d trust Babish with my life
3:02 Vinzcenzo??
this is so akward , i couldnt do it
That's a school? I honestly would of thought that was a prison. Why so much blue?
Please come to London and teach me to cook!
Where's the adult series, banging with babish?
Anyone else see Ryan Reynolds at 4:45 ??
try make korean egg bread or bacon egg bread
Middle schoolers are the least appreciative people ever lol.
Hey there’s a mash cookbook so maybe some mash food
I love this guy but am I the only one thinking this guy is gay baiting.. making it look like his about to suck some mayo
OH look a commercial!!
The weird "pancake checker" thing is a potato masher 😂
It’s all a great  cause but there’s something a bit awkward about this
Can we see this amatuer movie waterproof
And you're a great  teacher yourself!
Vincenzo on camera?
I owe a huge thanks to my teachers in all grades they all thought me a little something new to use now as an adult. Way to go Mr.Babish
Make the Krusty burger
and wanna have a spider verse watch party with me too ?
The guy didn't seem that happy
OMG Rashid is back!!! YEEEEESSSS!!!
Don’t take the kids being quiet too personal. When I was a middle schooler, I would definitely ignore anyone trying to teach me anything.
Wears a black trench coat to a school
Babish is like the real life bob.
Yeah can't say I'd recommend middle schoolers for first time working in a classroom. That went just about how I expected from the moment he said he didn't like kids. If Babish ever tries working classrooms again, I'd recommend high school or college age for him. They'd be a better match.
Omg it's Aesop Rock's chubby twin. That's incredible...
I am a Special Education teacher and what you did for your friend and your surprise guest was amazing! Many people think we have it easy just because we have off during the summers, so what you did for them definitely made a HUGE difference and made their lives so much better!
That. I s a potato masher.
Awesome friends!
This is terrible. Unsubbed
Banging with babies.
babish be lookin like Kratos 💀
Seems like it’s kind of missing the point to go to an educational kitchen and give the teacher an oven that does everything for you
Am I the only one who can believe he got away with a a whole band playing "when the saints go marching in" the loudest song in the history of songs in a NYC apartment.
That "pancake spatula" is a potato masher
I live in New Orleans!! And my mom is a teacher!  C’mon down, y’all 💜💚💛🍤
As a student I appreciate teachers. Just not shitty teachers.
Thumbnail is confusing. Mardi Gras or Mr. T cosplay?
Why does Babish have to be so handsome AND intelligent 😩🖤
What a Wholesome Video
Once, while watching a Mardis Gras parade, I had my son on my shoulders (family friendly area) and one of the ladies on the float threw him a necklace of HUGE beads. I mean they wee like 1.5" in diameter. A giant string of them. The lady next to us jumps in front of us and tries to grab them. I am 6'4". So I reached over her and caught them. The remaining string smashed into her face. I then handed them to my kid. That is my second favorite Mardis Gras story.
Where is Babish based at?
I recently re-watched your parks and rec burger competition video. I advise you to re watch as well and look at how much your channel has grown in just a few short years. It’s amazing how you once used to downplay yourself and your content.
Anybody remember that meme, the most interesting man in the world? babish is him reincarnated.
Haha don't feel too bad. I still remember being in school. Everything sucked :D. You just walked into a lot of suck. Pretty hard for anyone to get middle schoolers excited. Only one guest speaker was able to dp it at my school, out of like, 25 guest speakers we had over the 3 years.
I'm with ya Babby, I don't like kids either.
Wow how cool they got boogie2988 to play tuba for the surprise
It's a potato masher
That's not a pancake peeker, it's a back scratcher
I thought it said surprising rashes or radish.
I’m watching from New Orleans
Andrew doesn't like kids? I don't believe that...
Do a tres Leche cake
You are so cute with your friennnnnnndssssss!!!!
I first read this as surprising radish being with babish
DUDE I hate children sooo much, you have to marry me now
anyone knows the song at 10:24 ?
School teacher this guy's super famous! I'm losing my mind. 
Kids. He doesn't play fortnight or flex.
*sees the thumbnail*
What is this now, Andrew?
This entire show is a weekly dose of heartwarming. Thanks, Andrew!
For a second, I thought you were MC Ride
Retired ProGamer Friend, Spotting of Consoles and an Overwatch Backpack. Gaming with Babish next?
I love this episode so much
😁😁😁😁😁BABISH PLEASE MAKE FOOD FROM ESCANABA IN DA MOONLIGHT 😁😁😁😁😁
Still loving the "comfortable" joke you guys keep puttin in there ;D
Hurricane Katrina?! More like hurricane tortilla
Vinny as in Brad's pal VInny?!
Ah, the enthusiasm of middle schoolers.
Pensé que era el Babo, Lol
babish please come back to new orleans during mardi gras! i'd absolutely love to meet you!
Why was the entire middle school blue haha
These are the only videos that hit like on before i even see it.
You like quesadillas eh yeah I guess
why does babish look like dj khaled on the thumbnail?
i see babish has a juul. i see u.
WHY DID 95 PEOPLE DISLIKE
It's upsetting that you could tell the students would be minorities by the state of the school. How old that thing is with no elevator, why do they think they can treat kids like this.
idk man, as much as I love your channel, this series feels a bit weird
As a New Orleans native I love this! You are awesome and I love your channel.
DUDE RASHID IS AN OVERWATCH GUY!!!!!!!! OR WHOEVER OWNS THAT BAGPACK!
Im still sitting here being mildly surprised that a guy who got his start trying to make a krabby patty is now making his own web series


And is one of my favorite youtubers
This episode reminds me of that one Kanye quote "My life's dope, I do dope shit." Good on our boy for giving back at the same time.
I see David Cogen (the unlocker) there at the event! 😀
Nothing will humble you more than the apathy of children
That intro is crazy lit
Kids are a tough crowd lol I bet fortunate cookies would've got them excited hahaha
hey can u make a meal prep video
The neighbors: “IS THERE A GOD DAMNED MARCHING BAND UP THERE?! That’s it, I’m calling the landlord!”
Sawyer on the Labatt Blue Lights thats my man
As a student teacher approaching the end of a very daunting first semester as a full time teacher, I greatly appreciated and enjoyed this so thank you to the Babish crew for this lovely thing. Very refreshing to be reminded every now and again that the work we do is appreciated. Can't wait to graduate and get home and start cooking up more of these recipes! 
P.S. Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie now, and it was tough to beat when I saw the 2002 one in theaters as a child.
Dammit, Babish. Why you gotta get the waterworks flowing this early in the morning?
Is that our Babby with hair on the TV??
Babish looks like kratos if kratos took cooking as a hobby
I cant get enough of this content
Nobody commenting on Vinny showing himself on camera?
I thought this was going to be some type of kiss and tell.
I feel so confused that he pointed at me with his pinkie? Is he threatening me?!?!
3:52

Love what you picked up from Brad Babby ;-)
Thank you so much for this episode! I really needed to hear this today after a particularly difficult year teaching high school students. Keep up the good work, Andrew and crew!
I'm a middle school music teacher, currently sitting in my classroom on my lunch in tears after watching this video. 

(For those perplexed by the kids' reactions, don't worry- it's totally normal for a MS student to be completely stoic when you least want them to be). 

Thank you for making this episode Andrew.
These episodes make my heart so happy! In a world where the bad can be really bad it is lovely to have  these slices of kindness. Thank you, Andrew. You are an awesome person.
Thumbnail looks like Kratos at Mardi Gras
Holy crap... I went to school with the drummer of the band. Haven't seen him in 6+ years hahaha
I read the title as Suprising Radish
You're in Brooklyn...... You're kidding me
If Babish went to MY school, I’d be screaming, “OH MY GOD, IT’S BABISH!”
So this is what Rashid looks like
If someone asks about his money-naise shot on this show then I could die happily. Just imagine “hey, about that money shot?” Or “can you do that mayo thing again?” and he just straight up leaves.
Babish's voice is so gooood :)
"There aren't enough kind things I can say about such an important and challenging profession." Yeah we read between the lines on that one. 😉
Guys.......... was andrew not wearing a folded up shirt!??
What’s your ethnicity Babish?
I love you Babish, please do not become more than a youtube channel that cooks cool stuff from TV or film. If you really want to help the world, donate your time and money in secret, and keep social commentary out of entertainment. Otherwise it becomes self aggrandizement, and boring. Please please please <3<3<3
I too dislike children. Wanna get married?
Lol wtf is kid-safe knives?
Is it just me or did the first time they saw the title did they see "surprising radish"
Stupid ps4fanboy me saw the thumbnail and thought it was new god of war teaser
Your thumbnail was so clickbait. lol thought we’re going to see some Babish ta-tas. You’re doing great things dude. Keep up the greatness!
how can you even dislike this amazing wholesome content?  :(
I always loved cooking but this channel inspired me to do it professionally. I have lots of Filipino family recipes and I want to open my own restaurant but I’m lacking funds atm 🤗 thx 😘
Why did that thumbnail make me think of Ancient Egypt movies? 😐
looks at the thumbnail


Me: wtf.... clicks the video
Lowkey only clicked it to see you shirtless 😂😂🤤😘
1:51 season 2 is awesome can't wait to see season 3 and how Miguel recovers
we need more spatula humor!
This video is so shweeet awh 🥺🥺
What are you doing in the thumbnail?
1:47 "uhhh"
that thumbnail looked liked he got an orgy
Is it just me or the thumbnail looks like kratos...
Where can I see Water-Proof?
wholesome episode. Love it.
Yo this is wholesome. Babbish keep being Babbish!
That school looks like a prison ward
Damn bash looks like kratos in thumnail
Is he your husband?
sd
I thought this was a God of War playthrough when I saw the thumbnail...
Don't forget you are also a TEACHER to us 😉
At first glance I though Babish evolved into Kratos.
Thought that was Kratos from God of War in the thumbnail.
Babish, are you related to the guy that created Family Guy? You two look alike
You need to make more vids like this. Seriously my favorite cooking channel, no questions - even more entertaining than Gordon Ramsay for me ngl
This is the first “being with babish” episode I’ve ever seen and I LOVE THIS. This is exactly what Babish is all about!
WAIT YOU HAD HAIR?!?
I love Spider-Verse, watched it a month ago, and I'm still listening to the soundtrack on repeat
Shout out to NOLA! 💗
Yeah children are extremely overrated. ☹😂
GIVE YOURSELF SOME MORE CREDIT, BABI!!!
I mean, yeah, holding the attention of tweens and teens is tough and your admiration for those teachers who do it every day is in the right place.  But you've been just as much of a teacher as Rashid or your dad to all of us who watch.  Not just because your culinary insight or the way you tie it to pop culture, but because of how personable you are.  Your relaxed attitude and ability to show and learn from your mistakes breaks down that barrier of prestige that you see a majority of culinary personalities maintain.  It shows that the process is no different for a pro or a home cook, and that's what keeps me coming back to your videos.  They've made me a better cook at home and they've helped to ease my jacked anxiety level.  I feel more at peace and sure of myself and I'm a better person for it.  So Andrew, sincerely, 
i actually watched spiderverse last night, weird
Next series: Babish with Babish
Why can’t my school have a cooking class.
0:12
Vinny
Too cringey.
I was honestly expecting that oven to cost a lot more. I mean Samsung just tried to bring out a flawed folding smartphone for $2k, so $800 for a smart oven doesn't seem too bad.
so your name is Andrew... "I hate kids" I am 15 and watch all your cooking videos (this is not a hate comment)
64,113th view 888th comment
This show is amazing 
you deserve way more subscribers
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for shirtless Sawyer
I just love how you do nice things for people.
Let’s see some waterproof reunion footage! You guys are probably fun
You should've just told them your sub count, middle schoolers respond to that
Do all schools in new york look like prisons?
Just when I thought I couldn’t love you any more. As a New Orleanian who was there for Katrina, I cannot help but have the utmost respect for everything you do.
Babish, that spatula is a potato masher my dude
Babby. Best nickname ever.
Love you man
Wait, isnt that Rasheed?
You need to get you a truck with all that stuff
💙
In the 5 million special he could make a video seeing all the persons he did a Being With Babish episode and what difference he made in their lifes
why is the teacher not interested with babish helping him out?
Is he gay? What a waste
ummm are you going to post when you’re going to be here in NOLA??
Those kids don't sound excited at all. You're making food I'd be excited.
as an actual eighth grader i have to say: they are all Like That(tm). we are not impressed by you and your culinary wizardry, bald man.
I want Babish to Narrate kids movies
"I couldn't wait to bust in Shawn's class"







"Oh God he's already in the door way"😂😂😂
You sir, are a truly remarkable being. Love is just an aura emitted from you. Well lived my liege
Hey my notification finally works
Next Binging with Babish u should do the Sunday sundae from spongebob
Rashid is such a cool dude.
Broccoli wasn't put in right lol
Rashid!!!!!
This episode hasn't been as powerful as the others but i don't think that's your fault, i just feel that these should really go to those who are needing the help
"I don't like children" same.
Who came for the thumbnail?
damn, this just revealed how hard teachers try to engage us children, and how we just throw it in their faces. im glad i got to see educators in another perspective other than my own and i think i can be more grateful for them.
The best THUMBNAIL of your channel. Period.!
@bingingwithbabish Do an English Breakfast bro go full out
Here for Rashid
that school looks like a  prison
I know that this series is in its fledgling youth, and you might be working out the kinks, but it didn't really work well to have two people in one episode, at least this time. Since you had your good friend on the same episode as someone who needed your charitable act, your good friend overshadowed what probably should have been the focus of the episode. 
I don't know if you didn't get the footage you wanted from Sean Conley, or if he just wasn't animated enough for your liking, but the important, cooking charity session was vastly reduced by the gaudy, possibly unnecessary New Orleans section. 
I think that what you are doing is great, and I just want it to be presented well.
The world's most wholesome channel
The "pancake peeker" is a potato masher!
Of course Babish visits New Orleans when I can't go. Never should have moved away.
hello, im from new orleans and it’d be cool as heck to cook for yall while yall are out here
*looks at thumbnail
BIGGA U NUTS ?
The "comfortable" joke continues🔥🔥
Does Andrew now has also a Vinny? 3:54 
I thought for a sec i am watching it's alive
Teachers are never paid enough for all the hard work and mentorship they do for the children. I only appreciated their value as I grow older, and how much responsibility teachers have in shaping the futures of the students. To teach is a calling. Salute to all teachers! Thanks for this video!
That thumbnail is now my wallpaper on my laptop.
wlabs making the world just that bit better
One of the most wholesome shows on youtube. You are truly a inspiration to both the culinary world and us humans as a whole.
My freaking brain processes Rashid as Radish every time I see it 🙄

Also I got way too excited that you got to see Ralph Macchio 😂
Youtube Red without paying for it
His high five was denied @10:45
Bourbon Street with Babish
I was wondering how a shirtless Babish thumbnail coinsided with a middle school
:o andrew with hair.
Thank you for recognizing teachers and educators! We know when we take this path that it won’t pay much, but we do it because we love it. It’s really special though to have people like you recognize that, and show appreciation for it!
Bromance goal
Dad
my mother in law is a special needs teacher and it is by far one of the most challenging professions to have she works constantly at school and at home buying most of and I say that lightly her own supplies any time it's a holiday she spends her own money to give her kids a great day and I love her for that. teachers have it rough and deserve respect from everyone.
“I don’t like children”
When you introduced yourself to the middle schoolers you should have said “kids, I HAVE 4.1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ON YOUTUBE” on my momma everyone would have paid more attention 😂
I just hope that the next time you do something for kids, it's for those who appreciate it and not for those who stand by you chewing gum and just bein thankless.
Soyer looks like the famous Serbian musician Coby
"Once everyone managed to calm down" lol killed me
Don't worry Andrew; I subbed for a middle school class once and vowed to never step foot in any school again. I had the same lackluster reaction and zero control over the room. Props to you.
Hope you document the New Orleans trip! Its gonna be awesomeeee
While traveling, you should do big cookout meet ups with your fans so that we call all share food with each other and actually... Binge with Babish
I have a stupid amount of love, not just for you Babish, but EVERYONE that helps you with these videos; seen and unseen, mentioned and not - I thank them and you from the bottom of my heart for this video series. I love you all.
When I read surprising Rashid, I thought Rashid Jones. My bad.
Cringing with Babish (better name for this series)
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A THING
SOGGY IT IS
12:12
Painfully awk
12:05 Narrator "But they didn't fix it in post"
his face got turned upside down dude his hair
How do I get myself on this show????
3:40 you look like a mafia
I can’t believe they can still find idiots to destroy their own vehicles.
I’m paying for my friend to come with me on a boys trip wow I’m so charitable. Why didn’t you pay for an all expense trip for the other dude
It’s nothing personal babish, school just sucks the soul out of children in general, so its hard to feel apathy for much of anything in the term
Does anyone know why Andrew is called babish?
Tbh I live a pretty lonely life BUT thank God for people like Babish and their wholesome content, you feel less lonely for awhile :D
I have yet to get through one of these episodes without both cringing and also crying.  Thank you Andrew
“18 minutes ago”

What are you wearing on your wrist?
Wait. If you're still reading these. Way to go Babish. Way to succeed at goals, help people, help your friends. All the things, and you're killing it!
10:14 You know Rasheed and Babish are great freinds because Rasheed is used to babish being weird and dosen't care at all.
Only 2000 ovens? Why? That makes me feel a couple things. First, I'm overpaying for artificial scarcity. And second, if it were good they wouldn't stop at 2000, it's almost like they know it sucks and are just hyping it up to have a good initial sale before all the bad reviews start coming in. It's a weird strategy, it works for cars, not ovens.
im gonna make the still of you getting beads thrown on u my screensaver
Well I'm a 12 year old
Dude I made Quesadillas for the first time tonight. People loved em and it was literally your recipes so so good.

I make a lot of bean quesadillas and I put a little butter in my pan which gives it a nice flavor and then I sprinkle a little Adobo a Spanish seasoning 😋.  Some guacamole, sour cream and cold iceberg lettuce tops it off nicely. Love the live video. One suggestion....relax...you seemed very nervous.You’re good at what you do so be confident. Don’t take yourself so seriously. I love Monterey as well and Gouda is starting to be on of my favorites. Take some crusty bread like sourdough and fry two eggs  a nice slice of Gouda and maybe some ham or turkey... make a sandwich put a little butter in a pan and grill it like a grill cheese. Delicious.
Could you make some food from food wars it’s an anime
leave it to this dude to make a 2 hour video on quesadilla lol.
Hungry make a vegan one too 🥺
Not sure if many people still remember these, but what if Babish made some food from Humongous Entertainment games? 
PB&Jellyfish sandwiches or Worm Doodles from Freddi Fish. 
Chicken Knuckles from Spy Fox. 
Hero Sandwich from Pajama Sam. 
I'm just saying, there could be some really weird cooking opportunities with these games.
Make "The amazing world of gumball" dinner dates food

Babish is the bob ross of cooking
It is sticky rice in condensed milk.
🤤
Hey, Babish! Here is the best way that I have found to cut peppers:
Chop the bottom off
Place the pepper, stem facing the sky
Chop off 4 pieces around the white innards
Chop into slices
Chop those into cubes if you want that
I don't particularly want to ask for likes, because for some reason everyone hates that? I don't make videos and I just want Babish to see this. So maybe leave a like, sorry if this offends you for some reason.
Can ou make the Jelly Bread from Pokemon Sun and Moon episode, "Sours for the Sweet"

Cheese night is my favorite night.
Quesadilla literally means full of cheese. That cast iron made them look absolutely perfect.
Sup
I learned how to do the tossy toss with rice every time I toasted rice when making Mexican rice. Of course I made a mess but now I can do it easily.  Also I prefer to do it with my non-dominant hand to keep  my dominant hand free for other tasks while I'm tossing food in a pan

My good dude, please get out of the habit of scraping the cutting edge of your nice new knife like that. Flip it over and use the spine if you have to, but using the edge like a bench scraper is a great way to damage it. And if that knife is a Shun (I think it is based on the handle and a couple glimpses of a blurry logo), they're pretty great but do have a bit of a reputation for being on the brittle side for pro grade knives. Double plus bad to use like a scraper edge-first.
you do lve cooking too? ok im soooo putting these to the test when I go to culinary school. I wnt to try the chilian sea bass myself
This was amazing. The only thing I did wrong was make a mess of the flip on one of them, the other was perfect. My fiancé sent the livestream link to me and I watched it late this afternoon and made it for us for dinner tonight, your recipe down to a T and it was incredible. I’m not much of a Mexican cuisine fan but this was just delicious. I can eat the hell of this dish.
How in the hell did it take you two hours and 15 minutes to make a couple quesadillas? Ain't nobody got time for that.
2 hours? In Mexico a quesadilla is done in 5 minutes, lol.
Hey babish, can you please make the lotus flower from percy Jackson when they are at the club, ty 🙇‍♂️🤙😊

I'm realizing that I've been calling the Bubba episodes "Part I, Part II" and the Seinfeld episodes "Volume I, Volume II".  Is that ruining anyone else's day?
other chefs: 'Now add some salt'

Babbish: : 'kOsHEr SaLT'
worcestershire sauce: exists
babish: wUhSSERSAUCE
"I saw Chef John do it, and that's good enough for me."


Great words to live by.
You should make the "GET A JOB" soup from spongebob👍
Ingredients: exists

Babish: GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
Nope, I'm from New Orleans. Everything takes at least 3 sticks of butter!
No more no le-  ah nine times why not

Babish:You are already dead
Shrimp: NANI
4 whole fried chickens with coke and two pieces of toast from the blues brothers
On behalf of all of Britain, it is pronounced Wu-ster-shur
Being a New Orleanian, I have never had shrimp like that
Ngl that was more like fried rice than stir-fry
Dragon Ball Z, King Kai’s Overly Big, Fried Rice Bowl, For son Goku. (Babbish, You’d better see this-) .^_.-
sounds like cannibal serial killer ASMR
roast duck, flaming fire flakes and egg custard tart from Avatar the Last Airbender
I love how he pronounces Worcestershire slightly differently in every episode
Hey now Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama.
Oh that shrimp burger looked so good, my mouth was actually watering.
LOL shrimp burger more like fortnite burgers.... so anyways I got a squad in fortnite, i got 3 in it i need one more.

Your videos are so addicting I can't stop watching lol
Again...it may be spelled Worcestershire, but people in the UK just call it Worcester sauce, pronounced 'wuster'. The 'c' in the middle has no 'ch' sound just an 's' sound.

Ok ... so here's a tip... don't pronounce the two words separate just say WUH-STEH-SHUR ... 3 syllables only :P
Being from Louisiana, I’ve never seen that kind of barbecue but it looks like something my uncle would make

Question: how do you avoid death when pouring water/sauces over heated oil?
“...and pulse for no more, no less than 8 times... ok 9”
I can't... It's finally here. I need a moment to assimilate it.
I feel like the tiny whisk was either a lost bet or a mistake (EG: Babish meant to purchase a normal whisk) and he just rolls with it because why not? (and memes.)
Unfortunately there isn't enough epinephrine in the world for me to try making any of these, but a fun episode none the less.
The things I imagined babish doing to that poor shrimp

Banish you really need to do a video with some food from literally any studio Ghibli movie!
"Kevin cooks stuff in the office"  Just wanna put this idea out there!
Emeril Lagasse said "bam" not "boom"
That's how Babby gets the ladies... takes them into the "other room" to do nasty things.  Probably good though, don't want to sully the kitchen studio.

Finally, Part 2! Ok, now the dinner from Miss Peregrine's
That isn't how you say worcestershire.
Life is like a box of shrimp...
Babish. I cannot cook for the life of me. I still watch every video you make though. Considering I have plenty of experience with chemistry, one day I'm going to try one of your recipes. 
Wish me luck
Somebody was in a good mood - commentary was on point.
The amount of food supposedly eaten by Babish in this episode makes me think he might have had a few "jazz cigarettes" to help him out. Or he's just a very hungry man. :p Idk
Do an episode with Gordan Ramsay please!!!!
I mistook teaspoon of thyme with time so I threw my clock in
Erm.... that's "BAM !"     not BooM, Whamm  or Bang.... And as Chef John would say, " Don't be the skimppy of your shrimpy"
I can't believe people actually eat shrimps...
Any desire to make khlav Kalash from the Simpsons? Apparently there's a recipe on the net for it.
Woooo hooooo!!!   Shout out to Chef John
this is literally my favourite channel on YouTube and I'm 16 and can't cook for shit
Didn't Emeril say "Bam," not "Boom?"
Just made the shrimp w/ creole seasoning with chicken stock cooked 🍚. That shrimp 🦐 dish was 🔥.
I know this is random, but in every episode I've always been mesmerized by your watch game. Can you dedicate an episode to your watch collection?
I have a suggestion to what you could possibly make next. You could make the "Manwhich" from Futurama.
Forrest hump😏
Please do the orange bird from the green book
No joke my best friend is named bubba
You saying "boom" for Emeril put me through a spiral of every. single. time. I have heard Emeril say "BAM!" on his cooking shows. I don't know if I can ever recover 😭😂
Worcestershire is pronounced wer-stir-sheer
I would love to see you revisit ratatouille
Awesome episode! Someone needs to swap out your Old Bay for Tony C's so you can start living right! But you're a pro and probably have your reasons.
Brits may still ruffle at this, but I like pronouncing it as "Wir-stir-shir." Getting that rhotic "wor" in there, and yes, I'm sure we 🇺🇸 peeps know how to pronounce "-shire." Yorkshire terriers and shit. Amirite...?
Since saying "wuss-stir" doesn't roll off my tongue well, imo. But it works great with an accent from the UK so 🤷‍♀️

Most people I've heard, though, are still squarely in the "wir-ses-ter-shy-er" club, with an occasional "wir-chester."

Worcestershire sauce, such a lovely condiment, with a name mangled to hell's ass. It disappoints me. Don't make an American try to say "Gloucester" 😔
My mom uses pineapple in curry and I swear it really adds to the flavour
The 387 that disliked were lieutenant dan
Wore-sister-sure-sauce.
waiting for YouSuckAtCooking to use some Pestled PepperPepperPepper

-It's a New Orleans expression.
I just wanted to thank you, i grew up loving cooking and baking, i lost sight of that when i went through a really tough time, and i could barely bring myself to make simple foods to survive. But watching your videos made me love it again. Its my dream to be a professional chef. You got me back into cooking, and experimenting. I just want you to keep doing what your doing, inspiring everyone to get into the kitchen

Words cannot describe my joy a few weeks ago when I was going through some boxes in my garage to prepare for some spring cleaning action and I found a box with some kitchen utensils that had evidently fallen out of favor....one of which was a tiny whisk. It was immediately taken upstairs, cleaned, profusely apologized to, and put safely in a drawer with his big brother, Regular Whisk.

As a asian i eat rice everyday with anything including steak. Do not stir your rice while its cooking and let the lid open until its near cook then slow the fire to the slowest and close the lit for 5 minute to 10minute depending how much you cook.

You can't cook.
So how come you bother to de-vein the shrimp the second dish but cook them in all of their intestinal grossness in the first dish? 
Why anyone does the latter is one thing I've always wondered?

Never had rice cooked that way, and I eat rice every day! Gotta try that
put raw egg into da fried rice, is better that way. the egg that way helps make more sticky rice goodness, cause the fried rice stuff clings together more better

I find it so funny hearing Americans trying to say "remoulade" as it's just one of the most common condiments in Denmark, and is used fairly liberally here.

Dear mr. Babish. It's always an inspiration that you are a 'non-pro' cook, and yet you manage to make the most delicious dishes while being funny too. I have always loved to cook but your videos have upped my game a lot. Yesterday I made the shrimp burger for my gf, she was very impressed. Needless to say, I took all credit for it. Sorry about that. It truly was delicious. Thanks a bunch. Sincerely, some dude from Tierra del Fuego.
Everytime Babish uses Pineapple my allergies scream in horror.

I noticed you liked mayo.. 06:26 have you ever tried the Kewpie brand? it's pretty good. (I'm pretty sure you were using hellmanns in the video, I liked it before I found kewpie)
babish your videos are incredible. any chance you could do food from Steven universe? Lars' ube cake, lion lickers, cookie cats, fry bits, the pizza/fry competition, etc..
I’d love to see a collab of Binging with Babish and How to Basic
no way

Is it just me, or is the language in this video unusually «violent»?
AKSHUALLY, Emeril's signature phrase was 'Bazinga'.

or instead of boiling your rice awkwardly you can buy a rice cooker and cook it
trust me guys a rice cooker is a worthy investment

In Spanish, Worchestershire sauce is called salsa inglesa. English sauce. Much easier to say.
6:15 Oh No
This episode really spoke to me. If I ever find an ingredient to add, I’m always going “why not?”
Bubba was from Alabama, not Louisiana...
I just realized why Babish sounds so familiar in this episode. His tone is quite similar to CGPGrey.
FINALLY
Bab just say wooshy sauce,  soooooo much easier
MOAR!!! I'm SO excited!
Do spongebob colorful kraby patties
Man imagine if Babish made all the shrimp dishes?
What on God’s green earth possessed you to make a Southern sandwich with that heathen yankee Heckboy mayonnaise rather than Duke’s?
I still don't know where I can find "You-Know-What Sauce".
I feel so bad about this comment... The BBQ shrimp was not the right recipe.  Don't get me wrong, it looks good.  But the only recipe that gives the right taste is the one out of the River Roads cook book.  Also the shrimp should be served in a bowl full of the sauce and with a loaf of leidenheimer French bread on the side. No rice.
its just that.. well i have this to say.. spell the word enohghp backwards give it a call  with your phghone and tell me what it is.. the only hint I'll give you is it's used for hearing the annoying echo of your voice when on the  phghone
I stuff my BBQ shrimp into a hollowed out Baguette and fill it with the juices. Recipe from Liauza's near the Fairground in New Orleans

Since I was born in Worcester, Massachusetts I find this ridiculous people can’t say Worcestershire sauce 😂
🤢🤢
Dude....Emril said, “BAM!” Not boom. You broke my heart a little with that.
How have I only just discovered your channel, we’re like the same person (except your cooking is 10x better). Subscribed 👍🏼
YOU SAY THE W WORD THE SAME WAY I DO

People make fun of me for it but it makes sense
"We're pre-cooking and adding these things in stages to make sure nobody gets too mushy or rubbery"...
That's nice. Why was it not the case with the All Meat Burrito?
I’ve been waiting for this FOREVER!
Emeril would say BAM not BOOM
No rice is used in barbeque shrimp . you use French bread either sauce. I know I'm from NOLA
Emeril says BAM not BOOM.
How do you make everything look so damn good
We use crab boil in a shrimp burger
I think I have a crush on him
You don’t these recipes in most seafood restaurants.
But... Emeril doesn’t say boom, he says “BAM!”
Bam not boom :(

"All the cumin you have in the house"
Babish honey I have industrial amounts of cumin at all times
Instructions unclear.
I made stuffed crust pizza.
IMO, the highlight of this video is him teaching people how to make chicken breast. I've struggled with them and had kinda given up on them until this video. 

Let me tell you, the butterfly, smash, marinade, and really hot cooktop are next level. It's crazy tender and isn't dried out at all. Freaking delicious.
I'm deeply unsettled by that oregano pronunciation.
This video was posted right after I ate breakfast

I guess it’s time to eat a second breakfast
"Steakaterian" finally a word for what i am
Do mac and cheese next, please. Also if there is a good way to spice it up other than bacon(I've tried it so many times I'm bored) that would be great.
Babish: puts oil in his pan whilst making quesadilla

Me: Wait, that's illegal-
have you ever tried Oaxaca cheese?  because I think that Oaxaca is the best cheese for quesadillas........ 





Atleast for me.....
My man's said "oregano" instead of "oregano." SMH.
No way you said oregano like that ...
Says stop watching internet videos and go make one



5 mins later






Mom can we go out to get some quesadillas
Did you cut your finger or was that pepper?
Dude you make everything seem so simple.    Keep it up🙏
Thank you for those exquisite recipes and clean demonstrations!

Microwaves a cheese quesadilla afterwards
Haha, at my house you grab a tortilla, slap on any cheese, fold in half and let that cook until it’s melted





Needless to say, I’ve viewed life in a different way
You forgot to crush your oregano! :(

But your voice makes it okay. This time...
5:54 I'm finally free from the endless youtube cycle
* clicks on next Basics with Babish video *
I just made this quesadilla for lunch. OmG it was sooo good!
thank you for the vegetarian one, really appreciate it.
I don’t expect anything basic from you. But this is far from basic. LOVE IT THI
I’m glad you said TexMex aka Gringo Food - true quesadillas are so much better.
The oil at the end is unnecessary. It will get that same color and crisp without the oil
"now stop watching internet videos and go make one" I FEEL ATTACKED
Why put cumin in everything,  Mexican food not have cumin if you want spice put chili ,  and guacamole has concasse tomatoes
Can you possibly do Legend of Korras water tribe noodles?
I- I don't remember that being the way of eating quesadillas tho... but oh well, they look completely delicious and need them right noe for my carnita asada
"Or-eh-gawn-oh" and not o-reg-awn-oh. I'm lightly heckin salted.
After showing my parents this
My parents: confused Mexican noises
Looks delicious but that's not a quesadilla...
He is truly the Bob Ross of cooking. I love how calming his voice is <3
I have a suggestion. Instead of wasting a plastic bag every time you marinade something - I imagine you are hopefully woke about waste and single-use plastics - why not use a stainless steel bowl or plastic bowl, which you can then clean and re-use?
thanks for the vegetarian recipe! i honestly never thought of adding zucchini.  i usually hit my quesadilla with black beans instead. thanks bab!!
Steakatarian? 
Babish understands me
I, as a Mexican, only put Oaxaca cheese on half tortilla and let it cook on a comal (a metal plate, without oil).
But these are some fancy moves, pretty good.
For vegetarian quesadillas I recommend chick peas 🤪👌🏾
Quesadillas are not Tex-Mex cuisine.

Is that like a personal attack or something?


It's a Brie Larson reference, a meme, don't attack me please I'm so sensitive.
Not gonna lie, all three look delicious.  Personality, I would go with a mix of the chicken with some corn if I could, but that's just personal preference of flavors.
As always, THANK YOU FOR THE VEGETARIAN OPTIONS!! So awesome.
Yo dude you gotta try making Tonio's dishes from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure Diamond is Unbreakable!!!

Instead of oiling your pan, try a dry low-heat cast iron.  I think you get the perfect crisp that way, and it doesn't get to greasey or sloppy!

Thanks for the vegetarian inclusive option at the end!
It's hilarious how unless someone's a vegetarian they won't usually know how many of us thrive with veggie meats. I'm not trying to be nasty or anything, it's just not the 1st time I've observed a vegetarian menu being made far from what real veggie heads would eat.

Tried the steak one and it was AMAZING!   And it came out exactly the way you said it would.  Thank you for teaching me to cook and getting me a second date !! 😘 keep the videos coming I watch them all!
Babish, I feel you might have missed out introducing white folks to huitlacoche quesadillas or squash blossom quesadillas.  Maybe next time buddy.
no cilantro in the guac? blasphemer!!
This would have been really good had I not stored an excess amount of cumin in my house.


Was really more like quesadilla flavoured cumin in the end 😰
"Half quesadilla" :o? In Mexico it's not a quesadilla if you don't fold it. If you do two tortillas with stuff inbetween it becomes a sincronizada.
Nice 👌

You should do the Herring and pumpkin potpie from kiki's delivery service next!
please make new york style cheesecake !! ❤️❤️❤️ (strawberry jam topping is the best imo)

the intro is definitely channeling your inner Alton Brown and I am perfectly ok with that.
Jalapeno in guacamole? Nah, make it habanero for some extra kick! Works really well.
Babish, ily but you lost me at the oil for the tortillas. Then again I also only ever make ham, cheese, and corn tortilla quesadillas so 🤷🏽‍♀️

HOLD UP! You can sauté green pepper AND you can put beef on a Quesadilla!!!!! This man is a genius
wait I had to pause this because I'm upset about the way you said oregano wtf babish
Damn. That steak looked so good with the cheese.
Thought the corn and zucchini quesadilla was some kind of joke against vegetarians but I decided to try it anyway today. It's actually really good, thanks for the recipe!

How do YOU pronouce Oregano?
OriGano or OrehGano?
I'm watching this while eating and it's still making me hungry <3
is anyone still reeling from the way he pronounced oregano?
whyd he pronounce oregano like that, im scared
How can you see  if they are ready to flip? I did it too early and they fell apart. Still delicious though!

For some reason, in this video in particular, the narration and the video don't line up too well for me. Most of the time the narration is ahead if the video but at places it lags behind. Weird!
Ha jokes on you I made a quesadilla before I watched this
While I particularly enjoy your series, sir, I take great offense that you chose to marinate your chicken, but failed completely to do so for your steak. Skirt steak being as chewy as it is naturally, it would benefit greatly from the same marinade as your chicken got, and would greatly enhance the flavor profile of said quesadilla. 

Come on, you've never heard of carne asada?

Hearing an American say Oregano that way is off putting. But also satisfying.
If you cut it the opposite way, the middle piece is protected from spillage by the folded edge of the quesadilla.
Really nice Videos, thanks!


Have you considered doing a few episodes on "everyday food"? I love your Basics, but for me they are more meant for a special occasion. Like, what do YOU eat in between episodes? :D

Actually "half" quesadillas are quesadillas, 2 tortillas with the stuffing in between are"sincronizadas" so, technically you made proper quesadillas ;D
Oh shit bro, when did you upgrade to the Shun?
I always make mine in a flat sandwich press, as I am so unco at flipping them. All the filling falls out when I try.
Great video Babish! Thanks for doing the vegetarian one! I love when you incorperate vegan and vegetarian dishes into these videos. The more the better
42K likes to 302 dislike ratio??? That's gotta be the best I've ever seen!
Thanks so much for including a vegetarian option in there! I love watching your channel but usually have to adapt the entree recipes. Now there's at least one I don't have to.
zucchini and corn instead of beans?!?! I trusted you Babish.
Not putting sauce of any kind inside of the quesadilla should be illegal
Please please consider finding alternatives to single use plastic 🙏🙏🙏
Ah, I love the smell of a fresh-baked Babish video in the morning
looks awesome ,but i need my cilantro
But why not Asada for quesadillas those are my preferred
Anyone else confused for a sec when he said “oregano”? Lol
Pls do anime food theme food such us on food wars
I love the exaggerated quesadilla flip lol.
Make any food that appeared in Scooby-Doo and the Gourmet Ghost movie:
Elderberry Pie
Lobster(with lemon basil butter & garlic chives)
Pasta Salad
Nacho's Sandwich
I tend to toss the fillings and cheese in a bowl before sticking them in the tortilla, it tends to get the cheese all the way through so things are less likely to slip out.

Also diced chorizo in one of those is amazing.
I can't watch Guacamole being made without seeing that stop motion short playing across the inside of my eyelids.
Is it just me or do you guys also get surprised every time the intro song starts playing and suddenly stop for like half a second?
"flipping the 'dillas." Has to be one of my favorite things you have ever said.
You should do a basics with Babish On crepes! Both sweet and savory!
You should do the croissants from the tick season 2
You should totally do a basics video on kimchi...😉😚
You could try Squash Blossoms or Mushrooms too for more authentic Mexican filling for your quesadillas
Would you say the seasoning could also be used for enchiladas??
Make a "leftover parfait" from Malcolm in the Middle
You pronounced oregano like a British person.
That intro 😏😏
Lol, we Mexicans just flip them with our bare hands 😂
Was wondering if you could make Pizza Pouches from Regular Show
mexican: a simple tortilla with any cheese

babish:
U r SO bald but in a fascinating way.
Babish, did you just use a metal spatula in a non-stick pan?
I'm still waiting for the How to Basics with Babish crossover.
NOOOOOOO! Why did you cut the quesadilla like a pizza?! Are you crazy
When I make guacamole, i don't use lemon or salt. I add umiboshi plum vinegar to the mix.
Thanks for including a vegetarian option! : )
why were all of those chicken breast different colors ¿ 😂
Pro tip to make sure all fillings stay inside. You can use tooth on the ends of your quesadillas, kinda like a Bobby pin.
What about an electric stove top, I never get the heat right. And is a specific oil better for this recipient?
My family got one if those George Forman grills in like 2005 and only ever made quesadillas for the rest of our lives
He said OR-EH-GÁH-NO
You should make Bahn Mi sandwich from Regular Show episode, "Maellard's Package".


And make it the same way the sandwich employees were making it
Tortillas de harina doradas en aceite JAMAAAS! solo con las de maiz
Well crap. I've been making mine in the microwave.
WAIT WAIT WAIT!!!!!! I think you need to cook chicken to 165°F to ensure all the nasty bacteria is dead!!!!!
The way you say oregano...
Macs imaginary meal from its always sunny in Philadelphia?
I actually took your advice and made one. It was pretty good

Could you maybe try and recreate Michael Scott’s One of Everything drink?
Mississippi Queen from Regular Show.
I made a bean and cheese quesadilla and watch this after and immediately felt bad for myself ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Quesadillas takes me back to my childhood dinner😅😅
thank you for saying stop watching and go and do it!
I’d love to have your cooking ability
I learned something from Andrew today


Vegetarians are actually a thing
"taking our corn out of the can and pretending its fresh"

big mood
Thanks for the veggie recipe
Very impressive, but tell me, can you make MREs edible?
I know I'm late, but.. FINALLY!!!!
I'm fasting
An elote quesadilla would be a good cool vegetarian option.
My fiancé has a great southwest seasoning he puts on chicken. Sometimes we put it in quesadillas or just eat it by itself. It’s amazing
Really glad you added the veggie option in the mix! Looks great, I’ll have to try this recipe soon!
"now stop watching internet videos and go make one"
me: uhhhhh 
*links to other internet videos*
me: well I'm already here
You should be a judge in MasterChef.
That cheese did not look vegan lol
Just me or babish is a human form of Brian from family guy
Thank god you said oregano right
For the Veg-heads
Sweet potato, Kale, and Corn with some red wine vinegar is BALLIN' on a Quesadilla loaded with cheese
I (a time to time vegetarian) recommend vegi quesadillas with mushrooms
Il parle "tex-mex" mais j'ai manger quand j'étais jeune
Szechuan sauce
You should do a cook off with Gordon Ramsay lol
Have you ever used butter instead of oil in the pan to cook your quesadilla? 10 out of 10 would recommend. 👍🏻
You should make “the number 8” from suite life of zack and cody
165°F for chicken. Salmonella is not the secret flavor of the month
now stop watching internet videos and go make one
me: no i refuse (he says just because he doesn’t like to be told what to do)
Hey Babish! Can you make a series of "Preparation Techniques with Babish" or something like that? You are so quick with that and I can't keep up with lots of the tricks I see when - for example - preparing an avocado.  That would be great!
"One too many margaritas..."


Is there really such a thing as one too many margaritas?🤔
Hey babish, can you make the snivel worse from the amazing world of gumball please

Dude, you should've made a fresh tortilla. (love this channel BTW)
Please do coconut curry from teen Titans go
“Guac”?
“Or-eh-gano”?
Dude! 🤦🏽‍♂️
Dango from Rilakkuma and Kaoru
makes a vegetarian quesadillas oh so what's he gonna substitute for cheese adds cheese perfect
This is a great thing to learn to make, great way to use Leftovers. Also you don't have to oil the pan for quesadillas, most store-bought tortillas/burritos have more then enough oil contain to just dry fry.
Quesadillas are Grilled Cheese's cousin from Mexico
LAMB FRIES FROM FUNNY FARM! Do it! No balls....so to speak.
You lost me at vegetarian bro.
cafe rio chicken quesadillas are the best no one can top them
The best vegetarian quesadilla I've had is a sweet potato one
"Some of these must be doubles."
I'm vegetarian, and if I were to make a vegetarian quesadilla, I would put corn, cilantro, black beans, and sauteed red onions in mine. With extra cheese. 😊
I need to live with you so I can eat these after the videos
I don't like cheese, though I occasionally make a tofu version of this
Just because you said “tex-mex” at the beginning im not gonna rant about how these are not real quesadillas... they look really good though
I thought quesadillas were only supposed to have cheese
Can you make The Pork Picnic Sandwich from Regular Show?
>TexMex
No gracias goodbye
4:46 "Flippin' the 'dillas" Nice.
Now I want to make a video about me making a quesadilla lol
Now the pan's just started frying over the counter,
And it's gonna be a cooking day that feels so right.
But Babish won't be around at all,
So don't even bother to call,
Cause i don't know I've been cooking
That it always feels so right,
Here's Babish.
Ill just keep putting cheese on tortilla thank you very much
I have never assembled one before putting it into the pan. I'll have to give this a try.
"Now stop watching internet videos and go make one" but dude, it's 7:30 in the morning :(
Omg Andrew but imagine the corn quesadilla as an elotes quesadilla with crema and cojita 🤤🤤🤤
At some point you should make a calzone from we bear bears
Its 3:15 am and I don't even have tortillas for this and you're making me hungry
Mix butter with your oil tastes way better xD
No salamander? This is blasphemy!!!!
It's a lot better if you actually use Oaxaca cheese.
Make the sandvich from tf2
it would be awesome if you could do toriel's pie from undertale. It would be nice to see your spin on it.
salt and pepper beard yes
The broodwich from athf?
Man, I wish there was a Napoleon Dynamite episode about Quesadillas. But this episode was good, thanks for sharing your recipes.
I made these last night after watching. I remembered I happen to have the same size cast iron pan which I hardly ever use, so I took it out for this. Making half moon shaped is perfect. Easy to flip, and no filling leaks out of the folded edge. I layer cheese/filling/cheese so the melting cheese glued the filling in on both sides of the tortilla.
Best quesadillas I ever made.
Jesus Christ i've never seen that much oil in a pan for a quesadilla
The video ends at 5:10
No need to thank me
Bbq Pulled pork works really well on quesadillas
Could you do  quesadilla a la Kevin and the creme broullee from the office I know you did the chilli already but it would be fun ! 😁
Not one person has put this much effort into a quesadilla
Don't appreciate the call out at the end of the vid
I always makes my quesadillas in halves, it makes them easier to flip and prevent making a mess in your pan (I say this with experience haha)
Can you come back to food from video games like the idea I had in mind is the video game sonic unleashed professor pickles cucumber sandwich recipe.

I used to work with native Mexican chef. Who told you about frying quesadillas on oil? I mean, I can see pretty much few differences between your methods and his, but I always keep in mind that he said that lot of Mexican cuisine techniques vary depending on region, I'm just curious how you found this way.
Regarding vegetarian quesadillas, you should try sun-dried tomatoes and mint combo for it. :D
5:04 We the Steaketerians find your statement to be very unforgivable😡😡😡😡
Man, this guy is awesome.
Babish what if there would't be smoked paprika?
B A B I B O I ! I like the intro piece where you let us see your face and have a moment to get in to the theme and idea of the video. It's pretty toit.

Try using tomatillos and white onion and eliminate the citrus fruit from your guac. It's heavenly but has to be eaten quick (shouldn't be hard)
Just found this channel and I love the commentary and snarky remarks. But also a little disturbed you only brought the chicken to 155F instead of 165F?
And im still waiting here like an idiot for that second part of Bubbas Shrimp...
I am from Mexico City, and my preferred quesadilla recipe is: flour tortilla, manchego cheese, thinly-sliced pork ham. Fry that sucker in butter. Then proceed to plate it in a bath of non-spicy tomato sauce (caldillo de jitomate) and top with fresh avocado slices and sour cream. Oh yeah!
Hey Babish i got a movie food idea for you, can you recreate the rabbit stew from Lord of the rings, and maybe your own version of lembas bread as well?

Hey Babish/Andrew, can you make Sojiro’s curry from Persona 5? Nows probably the best time to capitalise on the Persona franchise, what with the smash dlc and upcoming announcements. And if not the curry, Akechi’s pancakes or The Mega Beef Bowl from Persona 4 would be neato.

You are a precious gift to creation.

Monk fish turducken from malcolm in the middle plz

You should make a dish from Courage the Cowardly dog

Just gonna say this


If my quesadillas aren’t made from a 30-40 Mexican mom I ain’t eating it
There's a puddle of drool next to me when I finished this video.
The way I always made Quesadillas is just put some shredded cheddar on a tortilla, put it in the microwave for 40 seconds, fold it, and eat it
What watch do you wear? Looks great!!

Tried doing it, failed at the flip
I used a panini press instead of a pan, wasn't as crispy as a hot oily pan but it came out pretty fantastic and no oil whatsoever.
I want Big Smoke's order pls:-)
I like how you didn't use coriander shudder
Finally someone says oregano right
What kind of taco bell quesadilla excuse is this?
Yo you don't fry quesadillas, but I will give you props for using legit tortillas

Babish calls casadillas basic me what is cereal considered
Seeds aren’t hot and you should know this.
U forgot the broke version of just small, plain mozzarella cheese
taco bell but with actual meat
Love your videos but I just had this argument with my mother. Putting oil in the pan to cook the quesadilla is unnecessary and makes it soggy. If you want that smooth surface swirl the pan while cooking. Also mozzarella and cheddar made the best quesadillas in my opinion.
That fact that the right cheese never makes it on this video is disappointing
Babish could you make the birthday soup from Little Bear?
You don’t put cilantro in your guacamole?
Make the manwich from futurama
0:16 and the next basics episode is.... cheese dips, oh gosh, Babish is trying to have a heart attack!

Is the way Babish made Chicken in this video healthier than other ways of cooking chicken?
Really love the videos lately, but I must admit - it has been difficult to watch these past two as someone who used to love dairy, but has recently developed some anaphylactic problems with it. </3
I get very angry when he doesn’t finish the food, please, I will gladly finish it for you
here’s an idea. make all the foods from the beginning of napoleon dynamite.
Love the videos Babish, but please fly down here to Mexico and taste/see what a REAL quesadilla is. That is blasphemy.
This man's been on trending more times than I can count
Hey Binging with Babish you should look into the "stew" from a movie called "The Sunset Limited" I think it sound pottery interesting and kind of mysterious.

Sad to see there wasn't a pulled pork quesadilla
you're making me nervous with that sharp metal flipper over your nonstick pan. Reckless stunts like that would get you thrown outta my kitchen.
I'd love to make quesedillas...but good cheese can be quite hard to get out here in Japan.

Did you know that quesadillas aren’t actually Mexican.
When you can't go and make one cuz you're broke.
Ah, something rather really *basic*, especially when the ingredients are simple and the process is easy.

Then again, I still want a We Bare Bears episode though, just because Babish is the only one who hasn't covered the series and its foods.
So, colby jack cheese?
"Now stop watching internet videos and go make one"
I would, if I wouldn’t be the couch potato that I am...🤣
Cheese isn't vegan right?
I saw this video yesterday and followed your advice: instead of watching vids I actually made these myself. They are delicious, I'm trying it again with some chorizo tomorrow. I think I put too much oil and even though the quesadillas were crispy they were also greasy, but I'll watch out for that next time. Thanks for your great videos, I've been watching for years. Greetings from the Netherlands!
I don't have that many tea spoons.
The way you fold the quesadillas is actually the correct way. In Mexico, 'quesadilla' refers  to how the tortilla is folded. It technically doesn't even have to have cheese.
Okay help me out here, my gf gets mad at me cuz I call "bricks of cheese" cheese loafs. I'm not wrong am I????

Mate, I usually love your videos... but using oil for ur quesadillas?! Amateur move. If I wanted some dense mockadillas covered in Spaniard sweat, I would have just rummaged through the dumpster behind a Golden Coral.
Wow, who knew quesadillas could be so complex. All I do is put cheddar into a tortilla, fold it, then microwave it
Lmao my dad from Mexico and he just uses corn tortillas and Munster cheese with no oil just straight in the pan

As a Texan I’m QUITE offended that you didn’t say anything about fajitas

I love watching this channel and i started to make this and realized after chopping up all my raw chicken i wasnt supposed to chop it till the end.If anything it will hopefully still be good
My dude how u not gonna crisp up the fold in the tortilla. just gonna leave that uncrisp, seems like a waste
Solo yo veo esto a las 2 de la mañana con hambre :"(

Basics, such a great idea. Babish, you know how to cook!!
BABISH MAKE YOURSELF A DANG QUESADILLA

We need a shokugeki no babish
Babbish : Says that Quesadillas are Basic
Me : Weird flex but okay
i COULD do all that, or just go to taco bell and place an order .....
I preferred to cook them in butter than oil
Delicious...but....do ever add cumin to homemade guacamole...and garlic? Interesting, never had it in my guacamole, might need to try. Good vid!! Now I’m craving a quesadilla!!🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Made the steak ones today and they were amazing!
Now I'm hungry and I want some quesodillas and I'm on my period!
Watch out kids
Why’d he say oregano like that?
For my vegetarian ones, I like a layer of refried beans, cheese and jalapeños
I love when my mom makes these things but she usually makes them with chicken and black olives
I literally watch anything instead of doing homework
What is the pan brand?
Make blue dog soda from Sam and cat
Babish I love you, but those are chimichangas not quesadillas. Chimichangas are fried, quesadillas do not use oil
Even though it's a popular ingredient, 
I really don't like onions in my guacamole. The texture difference is too much and spoils the guac experience for me. 
I feel the same way with onions/bell peppers/celery in my potato salad. Totally ruins it texture wise.
Why did you pronounce it oregano and not oregano........ 



Why did you just read the same word in two different ways 🧐🧐
Please do fajitas sometime!
Respect.

Esas tienen de quesadillas, lo que yo tengo de avión.

Babish you were supposed to be the chosen one!!
When a quesadilla has a filling besides cheese is no longer a quesadilla...
It's called a Sincronizada and it's a different dish
He was fast!!!!
You should make a hot pocket
it's impossible to not enjoy babish's food, personality, and casual joking and informality
All 3 look really good 😍
Some black beans and bell pepper (capsicum) are what I add to that vegetarian one for my usual quesadillas 🤤
Do cornbread baby 💪
what about vegan?
How are you gonna make quesadillas without queso cheese
I'm Mexican I will say those are THE MOST WHITEST QUSADILLA IVE EVER SEEN but I will admit they look good
Babish knocks it out of the park with the chicken, but OIL? Naw bruh, you use butter

Can you do enchiladas?
"what about a vegan option"
NO! you can't vegan a Quesadilla!!! it just wouldn't be a Quesadilla anymore.
I can make nachos as quesadillas
Im water fasting today and im drooling right now
The past two episodes, Grilled Cheese and Quesadillas, are perfect examples simple foods that are so easy to make yet so easy for it to go wrong
Who else comes here for the asmr
This is still way too complicated for me.
Video ends at 5:07
Made these today they are so good
Your amazing
by any chance has this man met gordan ramsey if not make it happen
Simple to make






Burns my house down while making this
Salt the outside, you monster. Did Kenji teach you nothing
Basics with Babish: A goddamn sandwich

First, you plant and harvest your own wheat, then make flour, etc. Until you have bread after a year or two, then buy cows and make cheese, after waiting 8 years we are ready to move on to the ham, raise a pig then kill it.

Assemble the ingredients like a sandwich (duh) then eat it, nice, easy and only took about a decade
Guacuhmoelee 😓
Lucky you’re not lactose intolerant
They need a chef like you in 
Spanish countries so they can learn how to make the best quesadillas
or-uh-GONE-oh? Oh my sweet summer child that isn’t right
Babish do a zero waste video where you make 3 courses without waste!
If you're Mexican they probably remind you of childhood 😂
"Basics"..... OK then
5:08: “what about the vegetarians”
clicks off video
What about like... just cheese?
u made me smile.
TRENDING
I saw you in one of worth it videos
How do u keep the table so clean omg
what size pan is that for the quesadillas when they are cooking a 14 inch ?
U should make mole red rice and boiled chicken
when someone says "basic quesadilla" I think kraft singles on a tortilla thrown into the microwave. this is like a 20 michelin star quesadilla
Dont forget to cut your finger. It's the most important.
I'm vegan. What am I doing here.
Is steak-a-tarianism a joke to you sir???? This personal attack has offended me....
What if we are lactose intolerant?
Quesadillas are my medicine!
Hey babish could you a video about my diet the cheese burger diet that will be awesome
i like to put cheese on both sides
I'm pretty sure I'm masochistic because I've just watched this absolute masterpiece on a completely empty stomach. I'm so hungry that I'm pretty sure I could murder for one of those quesadillas
Thank you! I love quesadillas with chick or something else for filling. I don’t like it with just cheese
all your information is amazing and great and awesome but i' really not keen on wathing this again when i'm sober because drunk me can't coprehend whet you're  sayin right now, slow down for me my friennd (and i'm sure many others in a post alco hunger mood)
Might I suggest pretzels for the next basic
o-reh-gano,
Looks good but very white washed.
Where is the cilantro for the guac?!
I would but i'm eating Dominos... what... thought so
I made it! Was really good:)) did mine with chicken and also a quorn chicken subtitute. Fried onion, pepper, a tin of mixed beans and garlic and ginger... on the side to add to the filling. Came out really well. Served with oven chips, guac, salsa and a cheeky beer;)
Make bacon pancakes from adventure time
I thought vegans don't eat cheese?
Ben 10 chilli fries plz
I love this channel, but one thing i want to ask about is the huge use of plastics in the process of cooking. Almost every video has disposable gloves, plastic ziplocs, and plastic food wrap. I realize that it is for hygiene purposes but it would be nice to see alternatives to plastic being used or at least a reduction because now more than ever we are coming to realize that use of plastics is unsustainable and extremely harmful.
Shark puppet!
I love these with no chicken, my favorite would be from chili’s or this other place that’s healthy kinda?
Layers in quesadillas are a sucker's bet. They move too GD much. Kenji has suggested (and i have adopted) mixing all ingredients in a bowl and then spreading into tortilla. This gets all ingredients suspended in the cheese, which is ideal texture-wise.
why cook in all that oil?
You can cut them into 6 or if you're not that hungry leave them in two pieces
Thx
K bye thx...let's do dis
Or-reg-an-o
Guac without cilantro? What?
You should make the potato chip salad and hobo soup from Frasier

Ever think of doing a video of making cheese?
Babish the cheese isn't vegan
Crab Rangoons! Crab Rangoons! Hahaha
Not cooking the tortilla in butter is heresy
What kind of Damascus knife did you use in this video?
im pretty sure theres nothing and nobody that make me as inspired and hungry as Babish
ORAGANO
I like your beard
If i made this i would only do cheese and corn.
Steak and chicken is what’s really OP.
i feel cheated, i cant hear the sizzling of those steaks
Simple And Awesome
What about vegans and pescatarians????
Um, actually, when flipping a 'dilla you have to clothespin it shut, obviously,
Cheese isnt vegan
Can u adopted me
So amazing
I wanna try those 😋
Skirt steak "super fatty"? Not normally...
The only thing I am ever going to eat for the rest of my life, is that steak quesadilla. Screw healthy food choices. QUESADILLA.
I just prefer Monterey Jack cheese only  quesadillas. Just the tortilla and cheese. It's so good.
I'm mexican and i'm suuuuuuuuper confused
I made the vegetable one but had a corn onion and bean inside. It was SOOOOOOO good holy
He reminds me of Ryan Reynolds
ARE U HAPPY YOUTUBE I WATCHED IT
video on thursday?
Look...I can't bring beer but I can bring a frisbee
Does anyone just watch because they are hungry
Time to head to the grocery store.
Nice video, learned a lot!
Guac is not supposed to have garlic
To each his own but I always like to sprinkle a little cheese on the bottom and top of the layers so that the melt glues the whole thing shut.
why not cut the chicken/steak into cubes? i feel like its easier to eat that way
make the food from re7
I used the rest of the cumin in my house in the first step so I don’t have any for the Guacamole...
What size cast iron is it that you use? I have a 12" but I feel I could use a bigger one
That’s the most American quesadilla I’ve ever seen lol
TINY WHISK!
Can't believe this steaketarian erasure on my Youtube.
It's about TIME!
Any chance you can add metric temperatures, weights and volumes in editing just up it the top  corner? It's annoying having you say the temperature in Fahrenheit and having to convert it for all of us in the rest of the world. ..... "until the internal temperature registers 155 degrees Fahrenheit"  ... may as well be saying it in Kelvin, I have no idea how hot either of those would be?
One thing I will add to this is gently spank them with spatula near the end will ensure a solid quesadilla and even distrubution of cheese and filling.
I say pepper jack cheese 🧀
Yes.
I'm making this today and having a few brews.
I never tried it with oil in the pan
Please do a fajita episode
Feel the love
Regular show pizza pouch

Who else saw this with an empty stomach like if you did it
As a Mexican, I can now empathize with Italians who visit the US and find out that Oilve Garden is a thing.
Should've had cheese on either side smh...
ora GONE oh
I've never used oil to make a quesadilla before, so I tried it, and I don't like it.
이형 진짜 짱이야!👍👍👍
Way to much work for a 2:30am post bar meal. All you need is a bag of Kraft shredded cheese, store bought tortillas, and Purdue pre-cooked chicken you keep in the freezer. 15 mins and done.
True story: Yesterday my boyfriend and I were in the middle of making the chicken quesadillas when we heard a bunch of knocking at the door. It was a small group of 10 year olds who offered to rake the lawn. They had with them a wheelbarrow full of yard tools (that they were very keen to show me). I told them to go for it and we agreed on a price. We also made them a bonus quesadilla for their efforts. After they finished eating, one of the kids said, “I ate that so fast. It was BOMB.” My boyfriend and I agree. So, those chicken quesadillas are both adult AND kid approved. 👍🏻
cries in lactose intolerance
Yummm
Fry in oil????????

Hrm well it's more like a grilled cheese or chimichanga at that point isn't it? I just put them straight on to a "comal" I think that's skillet in Mexican Spanish. I think I'll try to fry them in a little oil too, seems like a new twist on a classic (for me anyway). I like vegetarian quesadillas more cause they're faster and easier to prepare, (unless you have leftover cooked meat) just chop up veggies and put em in(or light saute in pan).

Also two words: Omelette Ouesadilla. Think about it, it's great.
Is there anything you can use in place of the garlic in the marinade? My mom's allergic to garlic and onions both.
The plastic bag marinade thing needs to end. Stir it about in a bowl. I have spoken.
Who else wishes they had such a nice kitchen lol
I never would have thought to use oil I was taught to butter it like a grilled cheese
tssssk. this isnt a "quesadilla" this has other ingredients. the classic is just cheese and tortillas.
Make ratatouille
The color words you use to describe things had be laughing the entire time i could not even pay attention lol
i wish i could cook
Bro, this is way too complicated! Everyone just takes cheese and puts it on a tortilla and heats it up. Boom!
Andrew you should make huevos rancheros from breaking bad
Next Binging with Babish episode should be the Twinkie weiner sandwich from UHF, that'd be pretty interesting to watch you eat, rather than make. You could even get the crew in on the taste test lmao
Is it vsauce
Why dont they call it texico

Flippin' the dillas
Cool video Babish! I've always wanted to learn how to make this type of sandwich.
Vegetarian which is a actual thing. 5:08
Flippin the dillas lmfao
Quesadillas are not texmex, white flour tortillas are a staple of north mexico cuisine, you need to use oaxaca cheese, also you dont use oil to heat up, you just do it on the pan..

Just by the looks and the over process, they dont taste even close to a bbq quesadilla, which i think what you tried to, also no one in mexico uses sour cream..
How about you try yourself on the famous Chili Dogs from Sonic Hegehoge?

I've been watching your channel for about a month now, slowly working back through your videos. This is the first thing I' confident I can do that my girlfriend will like. I'm making them right now! Thank you for all your videos, you're reigniting my passion for cooking.
Who else got caught at the end?

Anyone think Babish is slowly evolving into Alton Brown?

Mexican Grilled Cheese Sandwich
My quesadillas always come out disgustingly oily because the cheese gives off so much oil. Idk what I’m doing wrong
Do crabcakes
Thats not a quesadilla
Am I the only one that's gonna say cheese isn't vegan...?
If you don’t know how to make a quesadilla then you fail as a person
Vegetarian isn't an actual thing. Just sayin'
You're finger was bleeding!
getting "guac hand".getting "guac hand".
ill have you know that i watched this video at midnight and made them but mid way through panicked when my shitty stove wouldnt turn off but on the bright side i did what you did and they were damn good thanks
Quesadillas > grilled cheese
This is better than tasty
needs shredded chicken meat
Make a prison burrito plz
We make these with Rotisserie chicken (shredded)  and just regular Mild/sharp cheddar.  1st we put the tortillas flat in the dry pan, flip the tortilla and then insert the chicken and cheese fold half moon style  flip once more only about 30-45 sec a side. Slide out to plate and cut. 
Very fast and delicious
i will give you my first born child if you just give me one vegan recipe to try, please i'm desperate, i cant keep eating processed alternatives from the frozen aisle T__T
that's definitely a cheese steak in a tortilla, not a quesadilla
Those are the worst veggie quesadillas I have ever seen
oregano
Any tips on preventing it all from falling apart on the hob? Is it just too much filling or not enough cheese or something? :)
Made this after watching it. Definitely not disappointing. I love the flavor of this. Though I kinda screwed up and burned the tortilla while deep-frying. Luckily, I made 2 and it still tasted good despite a little scorched. Thanks for an awesome recipe!
Yummy their my fav.  I like the idea of frying shell in oil
There is no such thing as too much cheese.
Okay Babish got a new series idea for you, you might have heard this one before but I present the idea...B*tching with Babish it could just be a podcast or something were you talk about another that bothered you in your day :I
Please do a food from the hunger games....sorry I’m irrelevant.
white recipes
These were delicious
Hello Mr. Babish, big fan of your videos, must say that I'm mexican and in regards of the guacamole recipe, I have never ever include garlic in the recipe however my family puts in tomatoes, onions and fresh cilantro in it. Anyways, awesome videos as always
Great episode! The way I normally make quesadillas is I take 2 tortillas, spread cheese on the lower one, spoon my filling on the upper tortilla, surround the filling (usually chicken or beef, with salsa, beans, nicely chopped red onions, and some fresh jalapenos for an extra kick) with a little more cheese to help against falling ingredients, top with queso, fry up and enjoy!
Sad to say it will be a few weeks before I can eat this lol. I has surgery so I am on liquids for a couple weeks
Delicious
Please make princess diaries genovia food
Add beans you coward. (for the veg one anyway.) Nah you're alright. It just feels strange for the veg option to not have an equivalent protien that does exist within hispanic cooking. I prefer black beans but give it a shot with pinto or something else.
Corn is so bad for you lol
YUM
I really think you should do pot brownies man or just try cooking something with cannabis. It doesn’t have to make you stoned but id love to see someone use “herb” as an actual herb.

Wow 2 grilled cheese videos in a row!
don’t mean to be a internet troll, i’m sure these are damn tasty, but i’ll gladly have you over for some mexican grandma recipe quesadillas. included would be vegetarian options that any meat eater would ask for seconds. i always do!
Go make yourself a dang quesa-dilllla
I used to clean in a restaurant that made breakfast quesadillas: scrambled eggs, chopped ham & cheese. I make steak quesadillas lots but I add chopped mushrooms to mine.
Babish, bro when you deep fry your quesadillas, they evolve. They are no longer quesadillas, they are now a different food, they are called chimichangas. Look it up for some mouth watery goodness.
For an even better guac add some sour cream in there to make it even more creamy!
Wish you'd be more environmentally conscious and don't use a shit ton of plastic wrap. Was it really necessary? You have millions of subscribers and you could really influence people. It would be great if you demonstrate how to reduce waste in your cooking process. Thank you!
I high key have a final tomorrow but here I am, rewatching a video about making a food that I can’t even eat
Quesadilla aka Mexican grilled cheese!
I love this because grilled cheese and quesadillas are the first things I learned how to cook. I knew how to make them before I knew how to scramble eggs
RICE TORTILLAS.
These are some fancy quesadillas... i just take a nice slice of cheese, put it in  a folded tortilla on a pan, and BAM you have a quesadilla
The steak one is making my mouth water!
Are you bleeding at 2:52?
Now make real Mexican quesadillas
Since you did that ramen one you should do this one it’s on of those advance foods
He said 155 degrees Fahrenheit for chicken. Isn't it 165?
As a Mexican that quesadilla looks like it’s going to taste dry
But is it possible to have only cheese?
Tater tots!!
Me quedan más chingonas a mi
Is it me or does babish look like a bald Ryan Reynolds
CRINGE
I hate you babish you make me hungry!😂😉😩😩😩😩😩😫😫😫😫😫😋
No sir it does not
Do you say “quesadillas” or “quesadillas”?
When I want to snack on quesadillas I use tortillas de maíz. The way I make them is by placing one tortilla on the bottom followed by a layer of Oaxaca cheese then I place another tortilla on top. I put a bit of butter on both sides so its nice and crispy and voila, a delicious quesadilla 👅
i would love to see you do an episode on the one pot dish pelau
Esas no son quesadillas pero si se ven sabrosas
Esas no son quesadillas
Esas son mamadas
Lmao I just throw some tortillas on the comal with literally any queso I have in the house.
i cant make one because im poor
If you want a REALLY easy-to-prepare quesadilla, go with spinach. All you've got to do in terms of advance prep is to grate the cheese - the spinach can be put in raw; it gets cooked quite nicely as the cheese melts and the juices are released.
I have to ask... Have you tried cooking with hashish?  Or Jazz grass.... And thanks for doing fried green tomatoes. I asked alot.
I'm more disappointed that you didnt do the double cheese method. One side with cheese? :(
Anthony Bourdain wrote about garlic press in his book 'Kitchen Confidential' "don’t put it through a press. I don’t know what that junk is that squeezes out the end of those things, but it ain’t garlic."
But Babish, vegetarians don't eat cheese.
I'm sorry but what!? UNSEASONED ZUCCHINI AND CORN!? HELLO!? Do better man, do better! smh.
Who else wishes the cheese was more cheesy lol

How dare you suggest that steakaterianism wasn't actually a thing sir? I have been a steakaterian my hole life! I mean I'm not perfect, but I can take a joke. But my friend who has been steakan for 2 years now wept the whole night in the basement. You really hurt her there...
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I needed this.

Woah woah woah fam.... you add garlic to your guac. Yo my guacamole game fixing to go up thanks Babish
this is nothing compared to quesadillas form Mexico street vendors
BLACK BEANS!
Babish I know it's been a week but why not put cheese on each side?
So I’ve been watching these videos for a long time and I’ve never made a recipe on the channel because I consider myself a HORRIBLE COOK. But I saw these quesadillas and I just HAD to make them. They came out great. Yes I made a few mistakes while cooking but the end result was fabulous. Thank you Mr. Andrew Babish for giving me the confidence I needed to make these and shout out to those people who think they can’t cook, give these a try! If I can do a decent job at these, literally anyone can :)
Two cheesy videos? At this time of year, at this time of day, localized entirely in Babish's kitchen?
Now stop watching YouTube videos and go make one, subbing for a fact
Could you maybe make the gumbo from Princess and the frog? Edit : Please （⌒▽⌒）
use sweet potato instead of zucchini, red and green capsicum and leek for the filling, and since you've already used all the cumin in the apartment, try carraway and nutmeg, toasted.
can't be too many frozen margs
you forgot the vegan quesadilla with its filling of cigarette butts and sadness.
Nice

Vegetarians don’t eat cheese it has milk inside of it
Vegetarians don’t drink milk
Can you cook don cheadle
Funny how Babish's pinned comment mentions glasses and the color purple in a quesadilla video, since EG Twilight Sparkle has both glasses and purple skin along with an irrational fear of quesadillas.
ok but how does one use a ripping hot cast iron without risk of smoke detector issues
if my alarm goes off my building evacuates, firm company shows, and i get billed
If u put Chipotle mayo on a quesadilla it tastes like fancier taco bell
But you don't need the oil to get a crispy, toasty exterior... D:

Literally er'body else: STAHP STARVING US AND GIMMEH
So hungry now! 🤤 have you made Mole on your channel? I’d love to see how you bring it to life.
Say, are we ever gonna get the second part of bubba’s shrimp recipes?
Anyone realize how fast he's talking ?
Half quesadillas are quesadillas, if they're not folded then they're a gringa. Also depending on who you ask and what part of Mexico there from, sometimes putting any type of meat in a quesadilla makes it a taco, y'all can debate on that
I seriously can't stop watching internet videos
I wish my mom was good at cooking
How much cheese has to be sacrificed to satisfy your urges.
I’m gonna go watch more videos just because you told me not too.
I work at Taco Bell and this is not how we make quesa-dillas
Your videos are an absolute delight to watch! Trying to do some of them is a bit difficult without being able to use wheat flour. Have you ever thought of doing a video on adapting recipes for a gluten free diet? Or really any restrictive diet?
Quesadillas sound like tortilla and cheese in microwave
You look kinda old Mr.Babish
I want a taco
THANK YOU for making the vegetarian version 😭😍

Absolutely wonderful. Thanks so much for a veg version. I am a meat eater and my bride is a vegetarian. Awesome as always....Thanks!
I'm a big fan of baked quesadillas. It makes for a really crispy, crunchy quesadilla and is a pretty different experience overall.
Kway süh dyuüh
That steak one tho 🤤🤤🤤🤤

It's orEgano, not oregAno.
Is it Oregano or Oregano???
I was gonna stop watching internet videos and go make one but then your next recommended video came on and I was stuck
Remember people, you can make your quesadilla as you wish, flour or corn tortillas, with only cheese (whatever you like the most) or cheese with any filling (meat, vegetables). Even in some places in México you can ask for a "quesadilla without cheese". The first recipe looks delicious, but instead of oil to fry the quesadillas, I will use butter.
This is basics? Wow ... I suck so bad.
I just started my vegetarian journey, please don't tease me with the steak and chicken ugh. Lmao. Thought they were just cheese and veggie quesadillas :(
coosaydala's
Hey babish, i have an idea for a classic episode.... futurama. More specifically the episode at the fast food restaurant ‘what kind of cheese filling do you want in that?’ Pls i need to see a froot cup and cheese filled salad
Love this vid! You made quesadilla look so easy and yum with perfect direction!
Thank you so much for doing a vegetarian one!!
I loved the intro I would like to see it more for your next basics

Or you could just put a cheese filled tortilla in the microwave
This guy has amazing humor!!! Love your channel keep up the AMAZING content!!
You are fu$&ng amazing!!!!!  more vid of simple recipes like this one lol
Do big smoke's order from GTA san andreas
are we gonna talk about how he pronounces oregano?
Not Tex-Mex. Sonoran Style, get it right.
you should do a video on nugget in a biscuit
You said oregano wrong 😂
“But what about vegetarians because that’s actually a thing” 😂
Vichyssoise from Batman Returns.
Earlier today I made one with turkey
I’ve watched this 3 times today
why not monterey jack in steak one?
White balance looks a bit too blue.
I just to cheese
Should try making meatballs, burgers, or meatloaf with a corned beef brisket(biggest layer of fat off?). I made meatloaf with it and loved it
No... 9 seconds in and none of those things remind me of the word quesadilla. What reminds of the the word is the famous quote. "I don't know Napoleon, why don't you just go inside and make yourself a damn quesadilla!"
Wei nmms
Ayo all you need is tortilla and quesillo
i'm pretty sure constantly being fed corn against my will is why i'm not a vegetarian anymore. that and money.
I wander is babish ever gets light headed while he narrates his show
>oil instead of butter or lard in the pan 
Smdh fam
“Kay-sah-dill-a” i shall pronounce it no other way 😂
Some small parts hurt to watch, dude. I think to some degree you have to respect the original or at least show it.
Thank you for the veggie option, I will probably include the peppers and onion with it too...
Two cheesy classics in a week. Too much for me to handle. (I ❤️ cheese)
I used to have the same reflective coating on my glasses and people would always mention it lol
Can you make burple nurples from chowder
Can you just make one for me? Chicken or steak yum
Andrew we love and support you, but we are all worried about your cheese consumption. You have a long full life ahead of you, please remember that. We can get through this together.
Hold up lemme put that on my play list “thank 4 halp me thank”
Love videos and always give me future recipe ideas. Not really the type of person to say thats all wrong but the oil in the pan isnt necessary. Crispy quesadillas are easy to making on a tortilla pan or skillet without oil.
3:27 that was so frustrating to watch
Lol When he said flip the dillas, I lost it
You added a vegetarian quesadilla but what about a pescetarian quesadilla?
I personally fry the tortillas in butter on both sides - I add butter to the pan, lay the tortilla down, let it get soaked in butter, then I flip it. I let it brown until the tortilla starts having rising air bubbles, then I flip it/add ingredients while it's in the pan. I personally like this as it allows for a much more crispy/firm tortilla (my personal preference).
pro tip dont use flour tortillas use corn it might go against tradition but its better
Napoleon, make yourself a damn quesadilla.
No onions and peppers for the vegetarians? And have you tried Mexican cheeses for quesadillas? Queso Asadero is my first suggestion.
Do yourself a favor turn the video off at 5:06
It would be tricky to find just the right size chicken breasts, but it also works if you can pound them out into one superthin slice, cook it on the grill, and put them in a full tortilla as one whole piece of chicken. It seems to hold together better than way and I like the smokey flavor from the grill, but it's hard to get chicken breasts that match the tortilla when they're pounded out.
Can you please do the UBE cake from Steven Universe?!
I am soooo glad that you did a vegetarian option... though I feel it didn't get as mush love. Should have added some cool spices to the veggie mix!
I can see right through your mask Patrick Bateman.
I made this for my family and they loved them! Thank you for making my family happy
You can buy Quesadilla makers at most stores. They are WONDERFUL.
The lack of a seafood quesadilla saddens me.  😢 “crying eye emoji for maximum effect”
Do an episode with some jazz cigarettes
#32 on trending street
You said you cooked the chicken to 155. .I was always under the assumption that poultry goes to 165. Are you accounting for additional cooking after you take it off the heat? Maybe that's why my chicken is always dry...
Even though I k ow for a fact no one's gonna read this but you should Make something from the game don't stave.
i just bought a shun knife. i will not regret it
Now I just want some Quesadillas
I'm on a carnivore diet. Any recipes. I'd never thought I'd get tired of steaks
I WANT THEM ALL
Would layering the quesadilla cheese-filling-cheese instead of one layer of cheese glue it together better, or does it not really matter once it's all melted? I plan to try this out tomorow since I have the requisite ingredients.
After last video, I'm surprised that you didn't go ahead and make your own tortillas.
I'd add one rookie mistake in making quesadillas is cooking them too high. Yeah I didn't want to wait either, but trust me and cook them more on the medium-low side than medium high. The tortilla will brown and crisp to perfection while the cheese will be fully melted
Thumbs up if you stopped watching after the meat parts.
It not  meat it's carne asada
Why does babish always use kosher salt
possible stupid question : do you have fire alarms??
Also, those are some damn good lookin' 'dillas
Have I been mispronouncing oregano all these years? >.>;
I'm not a vegetarian and frankly don't fully accept the concept as my mouth has canines and incisors, but that option looked pretty tasty, 10/10 video!
Internet videos are my life...supposedly..sorta...kinda...
That's why I'm a Babish Lover! ♥️
When he said now stop watching internet videos I expected him to tell me to go sleep 🙈 ( probably because I should go to sleep, as it is 02:37 AM where I live 😂😂 )
no beans in the vegetarian one? I'm much disappoint.
So simple, yet so good!
I think I would put mushroom in Veggie for meatiness
I've noticed that you haven't made Curry yet, you should get on that one day
I'm hungry, let me have it.
oh-ra-ga-no? lol
Ringing with sabish
When’s the PB&J episode?
Babby-boy, could you also make a FULL quesadilla, and then just put a whole tortilla on top, if you're cutting it into 6 cuts anyway? Does the half tortilla help with pan flipping?
I don't like seeing your face
Oh my good gravy!  My mom makes quesadillas (although she calls them enchiladas because she doesn't know any better) the same way.  Whats up with this build it outside the pan, crazy crowded pan flip, drop cheese and fillings all over the place insanity.  Just put the tortilla in the pan, add a layer of cheese over all of it, and place toppings on one half.  When crispy and melty fold over the un-toppinged side onto the side with all the goodness.... and a quesadilla is born!
The heat is in the membrane, not in the seeds and veins.
YUMMY
Adds garlic and and cumin to guac: all Mexican viewers die a little inside. 😢
Thank you for this video! The last two times i made quesadillas they came out burnt 😂 Always so helpful Babish!
Been waiting for this one 🔥
Next week the quesarito 😂🤤🧀🌯
looks nice, but where is Bubba's Shrimp pt. Two?
Ora Ora Ora gano
why would you want it not to be spicy?
Your videos are great.... and your voice is chill as heck.  You make Bob Ross seem amped up.  Thanks!
Ora-gano?
You should try other Mexican cheeses, but yet again this is Tex-Mex and not Mexican Quesadillas.
People who aren’t vegetarians LEGIT don’t know how to use seasoning. This is why so many people think being a vegetarian sucks. It doesn’t. It’s just you.
Babish is secretly lactose intolerant
Lol whut
I just spent a few weeks in Mexico...Quesadillas in mexico are essentially tortillas folded over with a minimal filling, usually Oaxacan string chees or queso blanco, maybe an herb or two, then quickly grilled.
i stopped watching after the meat quesadillas... i'm not a vegetarian 😂
I hate tex mess. texas has bad food. No variety
Quesadillas are one of my favorite quick and easy dinner ideas. Leftover chicken? Quesadilla. Got some ground beef but sick of everything else? Cheeseburger quesadilla. Breakfast for dinner? Breakfast quesadilla. Last night was taco night with Spanish rice on the side and you want something different tonight? Spanish rice taco quesadilla! Leftover bbq chicken? Grab some pepper Jack and make a BBQ quesadilla.

I'm very not traditional with my cooking but honestly I enjoy many meals in quesadilla form.
I umm.. oh boy, I just drooled on myself. Embarrassing. Why ya gotta do that, Babish?
Quizz a dillos
Babish could you make the nasty patty?
Just a friendly tip. Corn from the can when put in a warm pan, becomes almost rubbery. Not a great feel to the mouth. I recommend you try it with frozen corn next time. I find it to be a much better result =)
This is an amazing series. I'd love to see you in one of Munchies Test Kitchens as a collab or with Matty Matheson. Keep up the great work!
Ore-eh-GAH-no? Bud you’re killing me.
Ore-AY-guh-no please.
This channel has been an inspiration to me in my cooking adventures over the years. I can't thank you enough for showing me and many other amateur chefs how to shake it up and have fun. Also, thanks for introducing me to Bon Appetit. Brad Leone and Claire Saffitz are national treasures.
it's pronounced "oregano"
Why does he look like a bald version of Ryan Renolds
Store-bought tortillas???? 😱
Its a flipping grilled cheese sandwich.  Recipe?
LOOKS GOOD
Saw this video during the morning and I knew that I had to have it for dinner. I’m currently in a serious quesadilla coma.
The chicken marinade is crazy yummy and the peppers/onions make it just so much better. 
I made it with my usual guac recipe (no cumin) and it’s perfect. The guac helps it not feel too heavy and I really recommend them together.
Definitely making this again and again.
What kind of oil did you use when you put the quesedillas on the pan?
My favourite vegetarian quesadilla is cheese, with extra cheese. That's it.
Plate presentation next please
I'm Mexican and you make these better than me
That's an interesting guac recipe, but I respect that it doesn't have tomato cuz then it's basically a salsa.
5:55 will do babie
Bailing with the bailif.
Unnecessary comment at the end
U know how there are pancakes and crepes a quesadilla is like the crepe for a grilled cheese
“OreGAHno”
I don't agree with using all that oil to "Fry" them in the end if one has a common Panini press (and if one is trying to eat healthier and lower their fat intake from all sources).  I fold and then put them in my Panini press with no oil whatsoever.   They come out beautiful and browned and crunchy without all that absorbed fatty oil from frying and finishing them them in a pan.  Even if one doesn't have a panini press I would say fold them, give then about 30-45  seconds in the microwave so the tortilla lays down nice and flat with the added heat that relaxes it and then put them in your toaster oven right on the grate on the "toast" setting cranked as high as will go.  Just watch them and when they get that nice golden brown pull them and avoid all that added oil/fat that pan frying to get the crispy outcome as displayed . There is no need for it!
So that’s my favorite cheese blend - what’s y’alls?
This video is just an excuse to flex all his cheeses

Next time on Binging with Babish:
I didn't feel the cheese was right, so I bought this cow...

That's a lot of effort into perfecting one sandwich, good job.
Brother I ain't doing all that. Sounds good but dang I'm cooking for grand kids. Bread, buttered, two cheeses and hot pan, feed the little demons and done.
Why did I only just see this video! Youtube is hiding my favourite people from me again :(

Woah, how did you manage this?

I bought it with money

👌nice
How do you Americans eat “yellow American” cheese? It looks like straight up plastic.
Why didn't you try garlic butter!?!?!?
Normal people: Flexing with Lamborghinis and other expensive stuff
Babish: Flexing with 18 cheeses
Damn I wish I could get 3.5 million views by making grilled cheese
this kinda makes sense in the show's logic, since the grilled cheese restaurant had a really long line and took forever to get a sandwich.

gotta wait like over 45 minutes in line for a cheese supreme.
VINNY!!! What the hell are you doing here?! 😂😂😂
Producer : How much cheese did you want? 
Binging with babish : Yes
Dammit, Babish!! 

Are we EVER satisfied until you make it by scratch? Are we ever?
I've never wanted to eat grilled cheese this badly since that GMM episode...
they keep pulling their pants up what do they do off screen???
Did I really just watch a guy make a grilled cheese for 7 minutes?
Brad when Vincent did It's Alive: 'Why am I the only one calling you Vinny, Vinny?' 
Andrew when Vincent starts working at BWB: 'Vinny was all about butter'
Guess you're not escaping that one buddy
HTME: I made a whole sandwich from scratch! 

Babish: Hold my burrito
If your grilled cheese splits


Flex Tape : Flex Tape what's your emergency
The montage of cheese stretch at the end was incredibly arousing.
I layer and toast the sides of bread with a little Parmesan and butter, good ol cheddar slices in the middle
This man just made a whole PowerPoint on a grill cheese
Butter, white cheddar and green chili. 
Stop messing around.
Red cheddar, Imperial and thyme... best! Also butter both sides of the bread... - that's my kryptonite, not forcing my choice, just sharing it
Never seen someone care and put so much effort in a Grilled Cheese Sandwich...
Grilled cheese is the best. I'm a big fan of using my oven.
You gotta add a sprinkling of just cheddar on the outside of the pan with some butter when you're about to finish cooking, it makes this really great cheese crisp texture and adds a bunch of flavor
Remember when this was just 2 slices of bread and a slice of kraft cheese?
Can you make food from Chowder? They have some recipes I'm sure you can have fun with lmao
I can't even properly walk in a straight line, this simple video makes me triggered -_-
Holy shit. This guy just invented the new best cheese.
literally a regular grilled cheese sandwhich with 73928236637282x the cheese but it looks good
gonna try this for sure.
i usually just use cheddar on the outside and inside but it definately gets greasy.
5:04 " . . . and once my cylinder has solidified, heh . . ."

Literally nobody:







Babish: sO IM MAKING MY OWN AIR
When you're poor but watch food instead because you don't have food left
my grilled cheese. dill havarti and pepperjack inside and mayo w/ shredded on the outside... white bread
White bread has roughly the same amount of calories as black bread
White bread is just sweeter and tastier
"This is grilled cheese, it doesn't need any help."  Please write a book.
Olives? You bloody anarchist! 🤣
I pray for the smell in ur house 🙏
Making a very simple food to cook as totally overwrought and scientific as possible. You really are Alton's progeny.
0:46 who is satisfied about the cheese stretch scene 🧀:-P
Triple creme Brie is my personal favorite for grilled cheese.
If u can do all foods from cartoon  scenes, I think u should make a restaurant of it😆😱😍
I mean a thought it was common knowledge but I suggest when your making your grilled cheese put a top on the pan to melt it faster.
when i came here i hoped your channel was worth failing for since i have a final tom and hellya it was, love your vids
Ooh, that's kind of mEta
Do the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
I want to do that with brie gouda swiss and sharp cheddar.

Eating a grilled cheese while watching this is one of the most comforting things ever
Maybe a new series!

'Babish on a budget!'
"My favorite's gouda! "
Yeah can you make this for me and ship it to my house
i tend to use whole wheat bc it has a great texture when toasted. add butter, gouda, 2 sliced green olives, salami, fresh basil and pepper. v. good, v. recommend.
babish: makes normal grilled cheese

also babish: makes even better grilled cheese

more babish: “im not satisfied till i make my own bread”
Brooo you went to level 100 and then kept on going, I would kill for a bite out of the finished product
I like my grilled cheese with a thin layer of honey
Nobody:

Babish: Now I'll make my own bread for the sandwich.
The best grilled cheese I’ve ever had is from this Arab burger place called Malik Burger. It was pretty standard, but the bread had a thin layer of mayonnaise on the inside as well as butter/margarine, which really brought out the cheese.
I miss regular showww!!!
😭
You should make spaghetti al nero di seppia from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure
Yo babish try a garlic butter its real good for grilled cheese and try adding some tomato, onions and a bit of shredded meat thats how I make it and its so good
WRONG Babish... the optimal lubrication for the ultimate grilled cheese is in fact... bacon fat. (Mic Drop)
Has Andrew stumbled upon the perfect grill cheese recipe? I think he has. I really do.
50g sugar!? That’s not bread, that’s cake.
........ How much money did you spend on all these fancy cheeses?!
Am fasting and this vid just kill me
The thing my grandpa always used was Sharp cheddar, gouda cheese, a tiny bit of fine grated mozzerella, and buttered pretoasted white bread.
but none of us were concerned about our cholesterol levels .... haha I'm dying
Putting the olive oil directly into the pan and then putting the grilled cheese in without butter makes the best tasting grilled cheese and its healthier.
You didn't try mayo instead of butter?
ok, just let me harvest some grain and milk the cows.
Clicked so fast shaggy couldn't keep up
I just knew cheese as cheese spread and cheese slices😂😂😢
impressed by the effort that went into making this! really nice!
sawyer was pure olive oil
U SAK SAWYER!
Please do Bill Gannon's BBQ sauce from "Dragnet," S2E8.
Only babish could make a grilled cheese this complicated
Sad to see the Vinnie-Brad collaboration go, but glad to see Vinnie landed solidly on his feet here!
It is 2 AM! Stop making me hungry at 2 AM xD.
The grilled cheese that I’ve been munching on since I was 5 is sharp cheddar and Gouda (both Sargento) with Parmesan from my local grocer on potato bread. It is hecking amazing.
Boi my grandma can make dis like in 5 minutes
“Some kinda science bullshit happens with its casing and protein”😂😫

how is it that this is the most amazing thing you've ever done on the show (says me)?!
Made this for the fiancè for mother's day! Best grilled cheese if all time. The sweetness of the bread counters the richness of the cheese. Thank you sir for teaching me how to make gourmet processed cheese (greatest oxymoron ever)
He stole Vinny from It's Alive! Nooooo
Yo dude you gotta try making Tonio's dishes from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure Diamond is Unbreakable!!!
Now that my cylinder has solidified
Hehe sorry
I’m upset that Mayo didn’t make the cut, it’s awesome in grill cheese lol
This is so extra I love it
If I put a piece of cheese on my $9 frying pan it’s staying there forever. Like actually never coming off, ever 😂
"Is butter a carb??"
I'd love to see your take on Kalteen bars from Mean girls
I love this guy. The passion for cooking is adamant.
bread with olive oil, toasted, and lightly salted is the best thing ever!
Surprised you didn’t use monster cheese. Melted it’s delicious
Return Vinny back to Brad he's probably alone and scared
Damn! I'm pretty much speechless .. drooling
It would’ve been something if you used olives stuffed with cheese (i hear that that’s a thing now)
You should try the recipe from Jane the Virgin

Where is Smoke?
Excuse me Ma’am.
Idk about you but the best grilled cheese is Swiss on dark rye
Awesome as always. We had a "grilled-cheese-off" in my kitchen a few years back, and one guy sauteed herbs into his butter in the pan before frying the bread, and it was revelatory... but while very fance grilled cheese indeed, it wasn't what I'd crave with a cuppa tomato soup, which yours absolutely is.
You should do the Erickson Secret 7 Layer Salad from How I Met Your Mother.
You sir are a master chef and scientist lol! Wow.

Man how much do I miss regular show
one question.. How long did this video take?!?!?
I think a key component you're missing on these sandwiches is salt, in particular you should grill it into the bread for max flavor.
Ahh , it's just a Cheese Sandwich .It can't be very complicated

Binging wiht Babish : Hold my beer
Do Fazbear's Twisted Pizza in the freddy files XD IDK
Do Granny Cream's Hot Butter Ice Cream from Hypnospace Outlaw!
Love it. Thank you for the tips for making combo cheeses.
Mayo crispy crust is the way to go, tho! Adds flavor depth and cuts through the saltiness of cheese in said sandwich! Anything else is blasphemous.

Jk, like what you want.
Question. If you was to prepare this block of processed/mixed cheese and keep it in the fridge how long would it last?
Please make Cheese-Feathered Hanetsuki Gyouza from Shokugeki no Soma.
Found quite a few videos on people making it, but doesn't look appetite at all.
You Used Normal Bread For A Grilled Cheese That Had Way Too Much Chesse, You Should Have Used Texas Toast To Balance The Bread To Cheese Ratio 👌🏻
Who else had they’re mouth watering during the video.
Who else misses regular show?
Dude I'm high asf right now and this video has me really wanting grilled cheese :(
Best combo possible: Brie, mozz, then any sharp cheese. I prefer cheddar. Had it in St Malo in northern France. Nothing compares or ever will.
It would be great if they started calling viny stretch



And only babish can make grilled cheese entertaining
I have a huge ass slice of parmigiana reggiano and almost an entire loaf of whole wheat bread in my fridge. This really makes me want to make a grilled cheese.
do americans seriously eat that yellow monstrosity, like yallre wild
This was amazing. Like crazy food science level shit!
My personal recipe for grilled cheese is any cheese I have around, and cooked with garlic butter

Kenji lol that's how I found you on his yt about grill cheese
Damn Andy, that's the most extra grilled cheese and tbh I'm not complaining.
I thought I fell in love when you curated your own perfect cheese but then you topped it with an olive ... *dro0o00o0o0oL
18 different kinds of cheese.

What's a good non-stick pan you recommend?
That bread recipe is my favorite, and I've been using it since I started trying out bread baking. Only issue I've had so far is folding it into a decent looking loaf. Other than that - It's the perfect recipe, and the break always toasts beautifully :D
Did you always use grams? I feel that wasn't always the case and  because of it slightly confuzzled.
hey man can you make Heavy's sandwich from Team Fortress 2?

Do a speacial Mississippi Queen from Regular Show with your crew.
Looks great but needs bacon and tomato/tomato soup
Olive oil makes a much better sandwich than butter, IMHO. You must also hit it with a very light dusting of garlic salt once grilled. Mmmmmm.

This episode was so good! I loved the light sprinkle of science and the "Good Eats" vibe for explaining some interesting food interactions.
Sourdough bread is my absolute favorite bread for Grilled Cheese. It tastes wonderful.

"some kind of science bullsh*t happens"  I'm going to use that now

It's Vinny! Did you come to BwB because Adam lets you go in front of the camera sometimes, too?
Can I recommend you do smarties cereal from The IT Crowd? Pretty basic and straight forward recipe 😂 but I’m sure you could do a really cool twist on it.
Sourdough bread has always been my favorite
I have found that adding "drinking"  8 shots of jack daniels make any cheese work well.... at least i think it was cheese....

Cheese? This? I beg your pardon?
For vegans/dairy free peeps out there Follow Your Heart cheese slices make for amazing grilled cheeses! 🌱💛🤗
I replicated this immediately after I saw this. 40 dollars later.... The process made for an excellent melty cheese. Not my favorite blend of cheese. Next time I would just use the blend of cheddars or something..
Quick question, where I live bread has no flavor, is bread supposed to have a flavor?
Cause its all about cheese man!!!
Nah man. Mayo is the only option for grilled cheese 🤷‍♂️
i like how brad runs into the camera
I subbed because of his sacrifice in the name of grilled cheese

I have a suggestion to what you could possibly make next. You could make the "Manwhich" from Futurama.
May I suggest something from the show chowder
please do the peanut chicken from phineas and ferb
As a Dutchie it's Gouda all the way! We have about 7 kinds, all varying in age and strength.
No tomato soup? Disappointed!

But legit, that last one was magical!
Potato bread (white is also fine),
Two slices of American,
Sprinkled shedded chedder,
Salted butter,
Accent brand msg,
Salt (a very small amount),
A little garlic powder,
Either a few drops of hot sauce or some red pepper flakes.

Cook it open faced (butter down) on a non stick pan with the cheddar sprinkled lightly over the American. Sprinkle the seasonings and then flip the two faces together after the cheese melts enough to stick and occasionally flip the assembled sandwich until it is golden brown on each side.
Are you cooking on a Bluestar?
Som si myslel najprv že to je Babiš xdd

Babish I think you are a cultured man; and cultured men pronounce "Gouda" as "How-da", since it's a Dutch cheese.
oh yessss, Regular Show!
Hey I know this is old but could u make the platters from monster hunter world
How tall is Vincent?

Cheese toast was the only simple thing I could do and I was happy untill this man came into my life
Dude, you take it to the next level
Tried this today! Came out great! A+++
Any thoughts on making a complimentary sandwich from Sheep in the Big City?
Are we gonna get "Jogging with Babish"? I'm concerned about your health dude.
I used smoked gouda and white cheddar on sourdough outcome was heavy but I paired it with a soup (broccoli cheddar)  but the soup choice is up to the eater. Good cold weather eats nice and heavy and filling
Sooo is there a spot on taste test?
This sandwich wasn't good enough so I made my own oven, made the pans,  grew the perfect cow, aged it's cheese for 4 years,  made the grater, grated the cheese, made the milk, made the butter, made the bread, and  time ended I never was able to eat my sandwich
You could have made the pork picnic from regular show
2:51 "no way was one cheese gonna cut it" -- there has to be a joke here about cutting the cheese. I mean, c'mon.

Babish you should check out toriko   
It's an anime of food
Oo, If I try this I will add Ham.
Seattle's best garlic sourdough bread, buttered on both sides, a light shake of garlic salt, cayenne powder, and white pepper on the inside slices of bread..
Thin sliced of cheddar,
Regular slice of havarti
Regular slice of provolone or Swiss depending on the mood
Grill in one of those foreman grills or panini press.
Sprinkle pepper lightly over the top.
Not as fancy, but it's freaking fantastic! It's my go to. Sharing just cuz.
U should try toasting parm on the outside of the toast
Aged cheddar, Gruyere 9 mo Gouda and Parmesan. Noice
grilled cheeses are supposed to be greasy
I want to be your friend so that i can be the tester.😅
My girlfriend always makes me the best grilled cheeses.

Butter and minced garlic in the pan as well as on both sides of each bread slice with parmesan on the outside for a good crusting. We use american and pepper jack cheese on sourdough bread. It is always the best thing to come back to after a long work week.
Now how about a deluxe tomato soup to go with it?
My favourite cheese is camembert, I always have it in my sandwiches but I don't add butter. My favourite is bacon and camembert
I'm so hard right now.
Could u try some Angry Grandpa recipes? Like the Hamburger Pie or the Trailer Park Pizza?
WEIRD FLEX BUT OK

I too, have a special process for creating the ultimate grilled cheese. 

First, I carefully place the 2 slices of prepackaged white bread with one slice of prepackaged processed cheese in between on the pan. 

Lastly, I take the sandwich, and I eat it.

Beat me now

"i'm gonna make grilled cheese."
"I'm gonna put some extra stuff on its bread."
"I'm gonna use literally every cheese.  Ever."
"Ah, crap, other cheeses don't melt right.  Lemme make a frankenstein monster out of them to make it possible to melt properly."
"..........It's only been 5 minutes since I made my own bread, lemme do that again real fast."
"....I swear, I was just making grilled cheese."
This is one of the best Binging With Babish episodes that I've seen lately. I learned a ton, I was entertained, and I'm very hungry for grilled cheese. A+

This isn't a funny internet video though. 🤔
He's Secretly Killing His Friends?!!!?!?!
try the cheese-on-the-outside with a lil bit o shredded parm, just added at the last minute of cook time. its great.
also, i usually just combine american cheese with a sharp chedder. preferably grated so it melts easier.
and for some reason sriracha is my fav hot sauce only for grilled cheese. guess its cause its sorta ketchupy, and i used to dip my gc in ketchup
Favourite episode so far!!
You are a God.
"not the hero we deserved, but the hero we need."
I'm getting the sense Babish likes Regular Show
A shmear of cream cheese makes my grilled cheese that much better.

you should revisit this episode w/ alton brown as a guest star if food network doesn't have dumb tape around him, he has an awesome video about a new style of the grilled cheese sandwich.
Let’s just admit it regular show was a Cartoon Network OG
Someone's gouda make a cheesy joke any time now
I would have loved to participate in this one. So much delicious cheese to eat
Red Leicester. Smokey and vintage cheddar. In brown bread coated with oil and bisamic vinegar then cooked in a George foreman till brown. The. In bed with the cheese add mayo and salary's such as dutch salarmy or so. That is the best way to make a cheese sandwich.
Another great video! My grandmother's deluxe grilled sandwiches involved adding finely sliced onion before cooking. This made it possible to open without destroying. Then thin sliced (home garden) tomato and hamburger (super thin sliced) pickle chips can be added. The thinly sliced toppings kept the toppings from overpowering the cheese (usually Velveeta). All of the toppings can be added before cooking, but the risk of a mushy mess is much greater, and not worth it. Thank you for all the hard work that you put into your channel!!
Cool video but will never ever......ever do this.
wow...just wow.
Mustache Cash Stash
PEPPER JACK CHEESE IS THE BEST GRILLED CHEESE CHEESE. DO.NOT.@.ME
Yeah I would completely pay $12 for that
Ugh I miss regular show so much
Just a suggestion... did you consider using caboc in place of butter? It's a very buttery rennet-less cheese made with double cream. It has a very subtle flavour.
That diy processed cheese looks pretty cool actually!
when you hit your toe.. you say AUW.... say G-AUW-DA not goeda or something! we got you babbi <3
But have you made a grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoes on it
Looks tasty, new ideas.
In English you say "goo-da" to Gouda? :D strange
Since we’re doing Regular Show recipes here, how about the Rigjuice? Lol
why yellow american. That thing has more plastic in it than the kardashians
And here I live inside a country where all the cheese is kinda hard to get and it's EXPENSIVE AF
Sadly the best grilled cheese no longer exists.  The best cheese was reagan era government cheese.  Canceled in the 90s.
Brilliant!

Gotta toast the inside layers of the bread too.
years ago there was a show called ham on the street. the host claimed that you can use a combination of any bread, any cheese and any flavor jam or jelly and make a good grilled cheese. i have to say that over the years every combination that i've tried has never disappointed
Use real cheese and not American processed trash

So I only recently discovered your channel, and I'm already in love with it. One thing I think you should do is the chocolate cake shake from Gabrielle "Fluffy" Iglasias' comedy shows. I've seen you do other foods from comedy shows (cinnamon rolls), and I think this would be a great thing to try out.
For me a grilled cheese deluxe is just 3 slices of cheese instead of 2
You made your own bread, you processed your own cheese blend, and taste tested the best possible combinations to put in said cheese blend....but you didn't cure your own olives? Fail.

SO MUCH CHEESE
Poor guys, they ate so much cheese in the name of science and didn't even get to taste the final product!
You should really watch What's Eating Dan. He has a video where he goes over effectively the same problem you had with your aged cheeses. I've found his method seems to work a lot better, that being either the method with brie and white wine, or using Sodium Citrate, which will produce that perfect american cheese like melt.
You can't imagine how happy i was when you mentioned Guda! It's Georgian cheese and i am so proud of it! 😍
I get fat just by watching cooking videos on YouTube.

"The least healthiest option is always going to be the tastiest one."  This explains everything from my love of food, my type 2 diabetes, and women.
Your videos are like tutorials on how to make food porn o-o
I personally would’ve used a mixture of salted butter, mayo, and olive oil



I mean everyone I know recommends either of those 3 things individually why not combine them it’s only appropriate for this specific item (I cheated a bit as the butter and mayo I use both already have olive oil in them strait from the store)
Vincenzo!!
I am eating a grilled cheese while I watch BAEbish make grilled cheeses. Haha, yes.

Can you make me a grilled cheese
I put parm on the outside of my grilled cheeses like what you attempted with the cheddar. I just butter the outside of the bread and then dredge it
I never ate a grilled cheese.
Hey so this is a weird question but where did you get your watch?

Fak I want grilled cheese now
What happened to Justin's knuckles?
I wanted him to make a grilled cheese with all the cheeses
Did you consider using Texas Toast for the bread at all? The thicker slices are optimal for any grilled sandwich in my experience.

Also my preference is butter for the grilling, but adding a bit of mayo near the end of the process. The hint of sweetness is nice.
Never has there been, or will there ever be, such effort into a grilled cheese
Always had grilled cheese with pickles, never olives🤔 gotta try now
I do the cheese grilled on the outside often. Not A LOT of it, as it really would be overkill, but a small amount to give it that crispy cheese flavor. Almost like a smoked or asiago type of cheese.
At least no one ran over the grilled cheese sandwiches by accident
Yaaayyyyyuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhh
I respect this guy on a whole new lever of respect
My dreams have come true

Andrew Rea, dude,  if you don't find a food product company and license this recipe for a grilled cheese-specific cheese food singles, someone is going to.  This is a thing. Every person I've shown this to wants to buy this product.
I don’t know why your hands are a turn on for me. It must have something to do with the association with food, I guess.
Whhhhhhoooooooaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Wooow
I'm gonna go make a grilled cheese
Mississippi Queen would be nice
Gotta hit it with a slice of America for some gooey bite along with a slice of provolone for a nice cheese pull.
you can do the same "housemade process cheese"  by melting your shredded cheese with a bit of water (or better yet, beer)  and a little Sodium Citrate.  That way you don't have to add a lot of milk, which can dilute the cheezy flavor.
not too suyre about this one babish
Hey can you do the shrips and prime rib in the teen titans go😊

So the secret to a grilled cheese is processed cheese?
Cheddar and Mozzarella cheese
Man that looks soooo good~🤤 




Too bad I'm fasting 😒
Can you do fish fingers and custard from Dr who.
Hysterical.  And, btw, it isn't "Deluxe" unless it has bacon in it. That's a well know fact--you can look it up. 

Best bread = sourdough (Whole wheat sourdough is even bester!)
Best Cheese = what you've got in the fridge. A combination of Muenster and Swiss is good. Provolone works well, too. As does Brie..... ....OK, back to the 'whatever you find in your fridge' concept.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH!
Italian parmigiano and gorgonzola or american fake?
I coat the outside of white bread with garlic butter, the inside of said bread with mayo, add a slice of american cheese to each slice, and add a pickle slice or two to the middle. Mine's better.

Ur epic
Love u
6:01 damn he got solar hands
I always used sliced cheese.  A good combo is Cheddar and Cotswold cheese.  Cotswold cheese is made with chives.  Another stand in for Cotswold is habenaro jack cheese.  These are greasy grilled cheese but the combination of flavors is good.

Why am i watching this
Well that was cheesy video
Bajingan
Try Oaxaca cheese! Even though it is similar to mozarella, it stretches more and it is a little bit salty.
Should have tried to include brie and blue cheese. The brie cream adds a nice stretch to the sandwich and blue cheese fills the nostrils with the aroma of salty cheese. I suggest Oka blue cheese. And letting the bread absorbing the oil from the cheese also serve to lock in the flavor.
Spongebob
Wow, I feel like a culinary master right now. I tried this a while ago and now Babish is making it! I sometimes switch it up with smoked gruyere and a dash of paprika. I also use the Parmesan as a crust like you tried with the cheddar. It’s a little greasy but not annoyingly so.
american cheese isnt cheese
This episode always made me hungry, definitely going to try this myself at some point.
THAT was super fun.  Add some Campbell’s tomato soup and you have my childhood.
Babish bro, the cheese was thick as the bread
Why do people go through this much effort for cheese on toast? All you need is cheddar, butter, and Worcestershire sauce.
wowest
In the uk we have cheese toasties where its basically the same as a grilled cheese but its cooked in like a waffle iron but in the shape of triangles and we use cheddar not yellow american
I realy have a Question ... im from germany ... and when i see American cheese ... im always asking myself do u guys realy have CHEESE ... some Real cheese ... because ur cheese always look like this chemical fake cheese ... PLS TELL ME ... 

sorry but my english is not very good
You got the cheese blend right (though I prefer a gouda with just a little bit of age to it for added flavor) and good qaulity olives are an awesome touch I've somehow never thought to do myself. However, a grilled cheese isn't truly a grilled cheese deluxe unless whole grain bread, some nicely crisped but not all the way crunchy bacon, and some homemade cannabutter are involved.😎 Thanks for the video, the method for making your own processed blended cheese for sandwiches  is damn useful and a cool kitchen trick!
Juden cheezen! 0:19
How is half a sandwich so big in that show
i have the munchies
9 month year old Gouda now say that slowly

Is the American cheese slices actually real cheese?
Suggestion: King of the Hill meatloaf sandwich with a side of potato chips.
Shouldve tried  honey butter
But you know what will be great with these great Binging with Babish Grilled Cheese Deluxe? high pitch voice Funny Internet Videos!!
So in my life time and work at several restaurants that claimed to have great grill cheese, a grill cheese deluxe is a 3 cheese grill cheese with ham and bacon (optional tomato slices) and a mild hot sauce mayo mixture. And Instead of butter on bread then grill it's mayo in place of butter on both sides which added a delicious tangy taste.
Heh... Babish attempts to make gourmet single slice cheese..... There is Project planner at bon Appétit really pissed right now. LOL
Is Vinny now really Babish's personal cameraman? Did he really stole him from Brad or is Vinny working at both sides now? Lol

I remember J. Kenji Lopez Alt once threw in a few slices of American cheese into a stovetop mac and cheese to improve the meltiness (to take advantage of the sodium citrate content).
For this creation, you are beautiful soul with more purpose then I can embellish with words. Thank you for your gift to humanity.

You should make food from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy like Grim's Cake episode "Waking Nightmare" where it is a chocolate cake with White (Primary) and Blue (Secondary) Frosting, "Sugar, Butter, milk chocolate, fresh strawberries (I assume the strawberry filling line between the chocolate cake layers) and lemon. A little bit of lemon and a whole lot of love."
Or Great Aunt Kali's Cookies from the episode "Recipe for Disaster" when her "recipe includes bugs: dung beetles, nightcrawlers and mashed crickets." (which you can use candy bugs)
I’m starving now
I don’t even like cheese lol
Hey! Could you do a perfectly times sandwich from Steven's Universe??

Hey Babish! You should definitely try t make the triple fried-egg chili chutney sandwich from Red Dwarf! It's an absolute mess, but I think it'd be fun to see how you tackle it.
Hungry
You need to fry both sides of each bread slice for maximum crunch.
Butter and toast both sides of the bread, coupled with a a good cheese blend is my go to.
So...for how long were you constipated?
Ayy vinny from its alive

Does processed American cheese have gelatin in it tho?
META
What a great way to end the video
Omg yes
Holy crap. I've watched like all your videos but damn. This was quite something.
Continuing with the regular show idea you should try and make the Mississippi Queen taste good. Good luck.
I think you missed a huge chance to add flavor here, especially when making the processed cheese.
The proper grilled cheese recipe in my house is sharp cheddar and havarti with a dash of garlic powder on brioche with clarified butter.
Cries in Lactose Intolerant.
5:05 Ok buddy really

Grilled cheese is just the inside.
Binging with babish 
Make a grilled cheese at but do not use regular American cheese use pepper jack then make a bowl of tomato soup but mix in a little bit of sriracha this is how I make my grilled cheese I like it spicy
"Apparently none of us were concerned about our cholesterol levels, but I kept telling myself that I'm conducting these experiments in the name of science" the most epic thing a chef can say. Right after " Some kinda science bullshit happens "
This is the Babish I miss! The experiments, the improvements, and the culinary finery (or monstrosity) that is the final product
Young Gouda is my rap name

Goated.
My family does shredded sharp cheddar and Colby jack mixed with mayonnaise, chives, and mustard, on sourdough, with plain ol' butter on the outside. It's the most amazing, beautiful grilled cheese I have ever tasted and I am craving it right now

One word to describe this video “diarrhea”
Vincenzo
I would kill for one of those bad boys
You add a fried egg sunny side up, tomato and bacon to make it deluxe
Who in thier right mind buys a goddamn grilled chesse. Grilled chesses also do not deserve a day. I dont know what's worse, the fact that adam sandler makes the best American-reality tv show or the fact that there is a day for one of the most simple thing to cook.
Did Justin get in a fight?
Try Colby jack cheese
damm i think i may need to hop in. but i have to give it to cheese curds and cheddar and pizza mozzarella!
I miss regular show 😪😪
Regular Show has the best food, everytime they have one of their made up things I always end up hungry for that item. Needless to say this looks amazing and that homemade bread definitely topped it off
0:15
Woah using the blurriness to make up for the lack of a green screen?
Hack fraud, two episodes in a row on Regular Show. How could you?
I had no idea making grilled cheese from a cartoon was so complicated^_^😴😴
For a second i thought he was gonna make a soufflé
The French have actually mastered the grilled cheese already.
The mouse community wants to know your location
Did you not use muenster? It is great on grilled cheese if you mix it with some others.

Is anyone else here cause jaseh onfroy burned down notre dame
You need French people to help you with this one
Cheezers doesn’t take hours to make sandwiches so this video is unregular
2:35 its there fault 👌
Its 28 on trending not 29......
How much money did he spend just to make a grilled cheese?
Ya tengo abre
Butter is an oil and water emulsion. Mayo is an oil and water emulsion. It's possible to grill bread entirely with mayo, instead of butter. It requires a lower temperature and takes longer, but tastes the same. The one redeeming thing about it is it doesn't taste too bad if it burns (it still looks awful). Burnt butter tastes a hundred times worse.
Nice
Is your friend Justin a boxer? Who was he punching before you filmed this?
@5:00 GENIUS!!!
Lots of work for a grilled cheese, but I’m sure it would impress Gordon Ramsay. 👍🏻
Is there any way I can order that cheese u just made lol looks super delicious and that homemade bread as well😁😁
Please do the Mystery Croquettes from Kill la Kill! You can pretty much put anything you want in it as they do in the anime!
Broodwhich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force

When i make mac and cheese i use chipopotle gouda. Its flavorful but too stringy. I use heavy cream but still. Any suggestions to make it creamy and less stringy?
Although it looks delicious, you cant just say its from regular show becauce the recipe for that specific sandwich in that show does not exist, its just a grilled cheese sandwhich.
Vinny! ❤️
So babish buddy ol pal of mine, can you try to make the perfect candy from jimny neautron, this one because it pleases every pleasure sensor of the tounge (or in the shows case: salty, gummy, sweat, tangy, fudgy, spicy, nutty, fruity) check it out for yourself but a quick description of it is a small purple orb similar to a malted milk ball with tiny yellow dots

Didn't get to watch this live. However sitting here now with my boyfriend and as soon as we heard "been here since the Frazier days" we both looked at each other and said wait when did that stop? We are now going through the library trying to see how long it's been. We actually didn't notice.
Hi Babish,

Long time fan of your channel.  Love that you’re tackling this recipe.  That said, I do have to correct the often misstated (British) assertion that it’s a UK dish ‘inspired by’ an Indian masala.  (There’s a pretty fraught history between the UK and India to say the least, and as far as cultural appropriations go, this is a more minor one for the Brits.)

The original dish is Murgh Makhani or ‘Butter Chicken’ as it’s frequently found in restaurants - the origins of the dish are in Northern India, specifically Punjab or Uttar Pradesh - although there are variants throughout the North. The predecessors of the dish originated with the Mughals.  Chicken Tikka Masala is the same dish within the family of variants, just a different name.

An analogy would be if a Thai  immigrant moved to Canada, made the family version of Pad Thai (there are many variations of Pad Thai), called it Kway Teow at his restaurant, his variation became super popular over 30 years, and then Canadians started claiming ‘Kwai Teow’ was ‘a Canadian dish’.

History/cultural issues aside, great recipe, looks delicious.

Best,
Hevil

Dear Babish can you please make potato hash?

It's an old recepie my family uses all the time but I can't find stuff do it it anywhere and it's a great meal and I want to see what you can do with it.

It's sort of like a stew with beef mince carrots onions and potatoes and I want to see how you modify it.

Basically you take 15% far need mince (you need the day to be delicious) and you cool it in the bottom of a pan before you add onions finely diced and once it's sweated you pour in water adding in diced carrots and potatoes putting it on a long slow boil it's long and it's good hearty it fills you up its like soul food and I want to see what you can do with it maybe add alcohol or different preparation etc anyway I'm really curious so please take this into mind for your next episode? Thank you
I have been on the internet to long I heard Uganda and I instantly went to he knows da way I regret a few things. Also i have always wanted to learn to cook and I don't like failing with all the cooking videos I have watched and your videos I would even try cooking a lobster or crab but my mom can't eat shellfish sadly so chance of me doing so is low. Keep up the awesome videos

You know what would be epic? A part 2 of Bubbas Shrimp.
I understand how important Being with Babish is, but does it mean we have to lose half of our yearly basics episodes? I really love the show so waiting one month per episode is not my definition of ideal, so tbh I’d be willing to see the live-streams sacrificed to keep our basics episodes
Why he not on master chef
Love your videos bro but takes me 30 minutes to make tikka masala. Including making my own masala spice mix. Couldn’t finish the video.
Will there be a condensed version of this video edited afterwards? It's a little nuts going through 2H 44M worth of footage to get the details needed.
Keemstar is that you?
That looks terrible
Thick the pretentiousness with this one..hungry I shall remain.- random Yoda cosplayer.

"If you think your taste buds are so incredibly important that their pleasure outweighs the entire life and suffering of an innocent being, I don’t even know how you can get offended when people question your morals."

“There will come a time in the future where we look back in shame at how we ate and used other animals for our pleasure. We will recoil at the violence we sowed upon them for our selfish desires. Just like all forms of oppression and exploitation that have come before us, animal exploitation will end. Which side of history will you be on when the history books have been written?”

“I used to be you. I used to turn a blind eye to the suffering of animals for my food, clothing, entertainment and household items. I used to tell myself that animals didn't matter, that my needs far exceeded the needs of some chicken in a factory. Humans are superior, at least that is what I thought. And then I could no longer live with myself, participating in the exploitation and murder of others for my selfish needs. And then I went vegan and really became me.”
How about that onion though
“This just in, local chef youtuber found dead in fetal position from beautiful onion.”

“No the fish had nothing to do with it.”
MORIMOTO FEEDING HIM IS MY FAVORITE THING
“Caviar is expensive OWWW (claps his hands) truffle is expensive OWWWW (claps hands) “ that was the most amazing impression of consumerism I have ever seen

Outstanding
Introverted flavors:

Babish: GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER

I usually watch my YouTube at like 1.5 speed (1.75 if I'm feeling spicy) but I can't do that with your videos. Your voice is lovely.
Feeding babish is like feeding a low tone Barry White sounding mercenary looking pupper
Camera man: eats fish

Chef: you have life insurance 

Camera man:

You're like a Bob Ross, but for cooking
Omg Chef Morimoto is so funny and has a warm friendly vibe😂 even though hes scary
"You have life insurance?" - Morimoto as he feeds it to the camera man
Since it's 4 Million subs now,
The word "4" in Chinese(e.g Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien) sounds similar to "death" in Chinese thus he's making the Death Sandwich on his 4 Million Special
Lol “do you have life insurance” 😂
How many times did Morimoto joke with you about fugu poison I have to know ???

My master told me of this bing of babish that he would create the death sandwich without proper deathquando training. I'm sorry to say this but he has only but a few days left to live.
NNooooooooooo!
Seeing poisonous pufferfish
Normal Person : "Ill leave that alone"
Japanese Chefs : "THEMS GOOD EATS!!"
Looks yummy 😋 😋 😋 
Am new and I already love your channel
That onion tho...oh boy...
When Morimoto was feeding you! My heart! What a great experience!!

Morimoto: They like the fish because it's dangerous and expensive.

Oh yeah, and it tastes okay.
Thim man could make me a bowl of cereal and it would be the best thing i ever had

Thank you Chef Marimoto
Morimoto is such an awesome guy. Great chef with a great personality and sense of humor.
Mr. Babish. I am a young aspiring chef that works in the best joint in my city. 
Getting fed directly from the hands if a master Chef, such as Masaharu Morimoto. Was no doubt probably one of the dopest fucking things that could happen in one's journey through the culinary abyss.
My first time to hear your raw voice Babish sir, glad to listen to it

So, this was absolutely adorable.
What kind of god are you? You can eat a Death Sandwich incorrectly and live.
THAT ONION BELONGED IN A MUSEUM

Pretty damn cool to see this video, Babish. Good Job.
Can you do the California Calzone from We Bear Bears
Regular Show has so many weird foods.

Watching World Renowned  Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto faking fugu poisoning for a YouTube video is everything I didn't realize I needed in life.

Don't suppose you would attempt to make Big Smokes' order from San Andreas. Just for nostalgia purposes obviously.
"Hey Morimoto, let me show you what I can do, here's the least impressive sandwich in the world. Please add $300 of fish on here. Taaaanx." :D Good episode though! And he Morimoto seems like a fun guy! <3

Hearing the name of my Childhood cartoon just makes me sad because it has ended
When you comment before the video starts

This is how ultra-instinct feels like
Do Ed's Sauce
When Prepared by a chef who knows how to prepare Fugu it is incredibly safe. Preparing fugu is like flying a plane. Someone who doesn’t know how to do it is extremely likely to fail. But somebody with some training isn’t. Like how planes are actually one of the safest  modes of transportation.
Moto Moto
He ate it wrong for that...DEATH
A Team Fortress 2 special owo
With the Sandvich, the buffalo steak, bonk, crit-a-cola and a bucket-a-chicken~

This was hilarious.
Please do bensons chicken wing chili
I wish I was spoon fed by an Iron chef.

“Oh, mistah camera maaaaaaaaaaan”

“You have life insurance?” Lol
The worst thing i hated was...




The death of an onion
now you must make the sandwich of life because yo ate the death sandwich improperly.
You may eat it wrong by not chewing and choking to death on a meatball
chef morimoto is the best girl of binging with babish
idk how you pulled that off, but that was sick.
Man I love your show... You're a shining example of a great guy and a wholesome youtuber as a whole.
Oh my god it’s Morimoto!
Lets go another regular show
BROODWITCH!
Just realised that i ate fried pufferfish.
holy shit! THE IRON CHEF MORIMOTO!!! Greatest episode ever!
I feel like he's an extremely funny guy if you speak Japanese
This dude is like the bob ross of cooking
I think chef moto moto likes u
Make some bacon pancakes? That's what I wanna make
I'm here for Babish in cutoffs and a mullet. Let's see if I'm going to be disappointed.

Edit: incredibly disappointed.
They know there main characters so they got the death sandwich
Where's the tf2 heavy sandwich?
07:58 I love this chef... such a sense of fun!! :D What a great sport of doing the sandwich with Babish.
Chaotic Good
It feels like most chefs are great guys
He finally made it!
Babish livin' the dream
You should make changs lunch from the orange is the new black and your own spin on it
Make a edible duolingo bird so i can get a sledgehammer and hit it
You should do foods from chowder

HE DIDNT EAT IT RIGHT, HE GON DIE
Congrats again Babish
Make the “Broodwich” the one true sandwich! Athf . I’ll even get a aqua teen hunger force tattoo with you.
I wonder what it would look like if he tried to make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
Make a good morning burger from the simpsons.
Make the special casserole from the last man on Earth
Dude it needed more sauce
Having an Iron Chef literally feed you from his chopsticks...life goals..
I like how they just start dicking around a few minutes later. Wholesome
But did they signed the waiver?
You should try making a food wars dish
I think morimoto likes you!
You have to follow protocol by wearing cut jean shorts... of death, with a mullet haircut... of death man. RIP Babish.
that man is my hero
Can you make the good burger from good burger
Make big smoke’s order
This editing style annoys me
The whole encounter with Morimoto had me smiling and laughing. Not many people can say they made a cold meatball/fugu sub with an Iron Chef. And... lived?
Regular show was awesome.
The Bob Ross of cooking.
Broodwich for 5 mil?
Why not "The Deathwish" it's a lot more creative. As is death wish(wich)
First it was the Everything Burrito , then the Ultimeatum , next the Eggcellent challenge , and finally the Death Sandwich  , the perfect dish to make for the 4 million subscribers
Please do the Mississippi Queen next
I have your Mount Everest-the opening sequence of EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN
will you make the dragon fruit me to hell burger? it’s in bob burgers and there’s no direct recipe for it but i’m sure you could make something great up
that golden watch tho
"Do you have life insurance?" I hope so, because I'm dead.

I wish Marimoto would eat ultimeatum
Make eds sauce from good burger
Do ben 10 chili fries

Morimoto-San!  Arigato, Jian.
Aqua Teens was so much better
Love how he was fanboying at the end lol

He's a very nice man.....I mean morimoto
Babish you never signed the waver! D:
A death sandwich? 
Wheres Matt Stonie he wil eat it even if he dies
Make a fishstick sandwich burrito
Holy shit it's so fascinating and great to see chef Morimoto on this show! It's awesome hardwork Mr. Babish🤟
And I thought you were just gonna add a shit ton of cheese
Rip Babish.
curry tapenade from A team
I'm so glad chef said that aboit fugu. It's not tasty, texture isn't great. Literally anything else is better. 

Apparently the deaths from fugu are when an old man catches one and prepares it himself. You have to have a license to prepare and sell it so if you're going to a proper restaurant you might feel the tingling on your lips from the neurotoxin but you're not going to die
Is those knife sharp because if they are then how are you doing fine and not getting cuts
MY BIIIIITCH
Foods from House!!
This chef is hilarious
Not nearly as appealing as the Broodwich from ATHF
I think a great episode of BWB would be recreating the Tave Kosi (The Albanian National Dish) from the Archer episode "Live and Let Dine".  Andrew could make Tave Kosi with a Thorton Melon-Ball Cocktail on the side (Cyril-I mean Chet could really use one)! I feel also it could be a great tribute to Anthony Bourdain in some way...
All of my sandwiches are dead ;/
I love Morimoto
You didn’t ate it right
No rooroo is my rooroo!


Ken-tu-cky friedu fugu Morimotō


What a legend
The only thing the first sandwich would kill is your breath

Im suprised yu havnt made the brudewich
The fact that u only sauced one side of the bread and didnt pour any over the meatballs and didnt shred parmesano over it and bake it a little bit irks me
Awkward Japanese chefs
This was so wholesome

FUGU POISON!!!!
Urgh. Dont watch when your hungry
Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto is literally considered one of the greatest chefs in the entire world when it comes to fish, and Babish gets to have him teach him how to cook a fish in his kitchen. That must have been insane XD
It doesn't taste right because you forgot to wear the cutoffs and a mullet.
Thought this was going to be the broodwitch from aqhf
2 of the cutest chefs in the world

I ate at his place in philly. It’s was amazing!
I think I remember morimoto being the name of someone in regular show or something along the lines of it
You make this sandwich but not the Broodwich?  You'd also have to get some rotten lettuce so I can see that as a turn off...
Regular show was so great
You should make the Mac and cheese omelette off American dad

Sips what I assume is either Scotch or Bourbon
Aaaah sunuvabitch
This series is basically babish doing therapy with food and gifts 😂
5:56 "When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change."
People still quoting Uncle Iroh, years after...
Welcome back to another episode of babish conjures tears out of thin air
"I want to give to those around me, but it's hard when I can't even give to myself". Girl, I feel that so much. SO MUCH.
cut screams always get me...keep up the good work mang
"It's called a jungle cat..."
shows off ceramic japanese maneki-neko
"This ceramic tiki mug"
*confused squint*
Their mom was speechless the whole time, hopefully the gifts are enough to push them in the direction they need to head.
Dude you're like Oprah with a beard...dare I say...bro-prah..


Ok I'll stop, but please don't stop being awesome and being you my dude.
I am telling you: Babish will be president.
They're both eloquent and have enough personality to definitely make a YouTube channel work.
I was watching an interview with Mr. Beast where he said "If the other guy is spending an hour on a video I want to be spending ten hours, or if the other guy is spending ten hours I want to spend days making a video, maybe even months" and I just feel like you're doing the exact same thing. The amount of time and effort put into these is very apparent, and I just wanted to say that you're an inspiration to me.
Babish changing/shaping the internet cooking game... Good on you man. Do it. Keep doing it.
Coming from a Being alumni, this was another wonderful, heartwarming episode, Andrew. Bless you! Also, I love that family! I can't wait to watch them grow. Now, what is their channel so we can all subscribe?
I need a show where you talk about things after having a jazz cigarette. Blazing with Babish.
He keeps saying her name as "Sucky" lmao
All very brilliant, my favourite bit? You sitting there with a towel round your head. Silly boy. 😂
So I've always thought I was going to do something involving my visual art hobby as a career. However I've always loved to cook. After watching literally every episode you have on your chanel in the span of like a week, and recreating several of your recipes, I've decided to enroll in culinary school once I figure out tuition. In the mean time I've just ordered you book and preordered you book coming out in October. I love you and your show.
Was that Dadish at the beginning?  He looks just like you!
He is one of the few people on YouTube that I well and truly respect with out being aquatinted.
I literally cant think of a reason why theres almost 700 dislikes on this
My respect for this man is unbelievable, he’s just such a wholesome guy.
And again I made the mistake of watching your stuff hungry.... Now I have to go shopping and cooking....
I'm not okay, did someone say Bawling with Babish 😰
Being with Babish is legit the first YouTube series to make me cry every time AND WE'RE ONLY TWO EPISODES IN

Come ON dude, is it legal to be this wholesome of a person? Where's the catch???

In all honesty though, I respect the absolute shit out of you for this whole series. The feels I'm getting out of this are enormous.

I came here because I love cooking, but I'm staying here because I found such a genuine person to support.
Need to try some of the foods from Spirited Away,  pleeeeease
Whoever disliked this is that one piece of Burnt piece of popcorn at the bottom of the container when you thought the popcorn was just getting good.
I'm going to cry again....

Edit: yup teared up again

Keep doing good Babish.
I don't know how i've been watchhing unsubscribed. This episode sealed the deal. You have such a good heart! God bless those sisters too.
So he has a Towel on his head?




Doesn't even has hair








No offense
Babish I love your Emmy-award quality videos. Please keep making them don’t stop

Entirely feel where Suki is at, seen many friends who have gone through the same struggles, and know that something nice like this can just change someones entire outlook on life, even if only for a day. Thanks for this.
Incredible job Andrew. I love how you made sure you have a conversation with them first. The most important thing in mending relationships.
When I originally saw the title of the first Being with Babish video, I was worried that the series be self-congratulatory, like those videos of people giving money to homeless people. 
I'm so, so glad to see that it's way more than that. You really make an effort to connect with the people that you're helping, and that's really admirable. They say "it's the thought that counts," and you really do put a lot of thought into these episodes.
Cheeky Rolex Daytona at 2:31 in the slot machine reflection.
Omg congrats Andrew, you deserve so much more subs keep up the great work! ❤️👏🥳
Absolutely Awesome. THIS is how you create a LEGACY
Babish! You should make something from gilmore girls! SO MANY FOOD REFERENCES is crazy ! love your channel!!
Holy cow Babish...This has heart. I love this series and I hope it continues for a long time.  I was lucky enough to marry an amazing cook, and she was able to weave food into my life in a way I never thought possible. Food is so essential to who we are as a people. I grew up in a house with a southern mom. Everything I had as a kid was "comfort food". I married someone from another part of world and was introduced to a completely different kind of "comfort food". The greatest expression of love was when my wife cooked a southern comfort food for me. A food she had no experience with. It was so good....that food had love in it. It's concept difficult to explain, but I see world class chef's express it in their own dishes. You touched on it in this video. Thank you. Keep it up, you are doing amazing stuff.
Dang that made me tearful. What a great deed you did for them. Wow! 
Great content Babby!
Anxiously waiting for the recreation of the imaginary feast from Hook.
Great job Babish !!!  I think it's awesome you are sharing your good fortune with other people keep up the awesome work
A man who can cook
Is kind and giving 
Handsome as HELL
What more could you ask for?
OMFG VINNY - brb im dumping my boyfriend
2 for 2 making a mid 20s man cry lmao keep it up Andrew
Please drop their YouTube or podcast when it comes out
This series is my favorite I’ve EVER seen on YouTube, and it’s only episode two. What you are doing is incredible, and I hope you keep doing it. You are inspiring.
Can we rename this series Bawling with Babish? Keep doing good work, Andrew, this is so awesome.
Aww this is the wholesome material I've been looking for ヾ(｡>﹏<｡)ﾉﾞ✧*。
kimchi!!!??
This is beautiful. I love your spirit Andrew! Keep being amazing. 
Also I NEED the link to their YouTube channel as soon as they get it going!
Nothing but positivity and love. Great work andrew you’re inspiring everyone. 
The world is a happy little place because of you. Much respect
7:48 SOMEONE HAS USED THE TERM SPATCHCOCK CORRECTLY!
The mom for some reason seems kinda salty
Your voice is on the same wavelength as David Attenborough.


Please do some sort of relaxation and wellbeing video, i would like to push you a little out of your comfort zone, not just for you, but to benefit others. This is primarily due to having severe insomnia and voice such as David Attenborough help me significantly in maintaining the thoughts in my mind to relax me so i can sleep more than 2 or 3 hours a night.


(also, this is so heart-warming and you are the best)
You were pun-prepared.  IT WAS RIGHT THERE.
Who is cutting onions??
Andrew! Stop cutting onions, I'm crying!
You sir are hands down my favorite YouTube channel I watch regularly, down to earth and just overall a good dude. Wish you nothing but the best in everything you do sir!
Amazing content bro 🤘 since you went to Vegas you should make the blueberry muffins from Casino. 👊
oh my god , gob bless them
Thank you for being amazing and for giving this family the outlet that they needed. 

And for giving them a decent meal. 

:)
i just gotta say i'm loving this series. you're a beautiful human my dude! \m/
It's amazing to see someone so deserving of love and light have some shed on their life! Awesome work Bab,, love ya Sukki!!!
I love the new series great twist on what you've always done!!
seeing andrew in a bomber jacket made me......inexplicably uncomfortable
IRON CHEF MORIMOTO!!!! The mashup I didn’t know I needed! Morimoto was the best iron chef
I think being able to identify with the subject of your video is important for this kind of show, but I just couldn't in this Episode. It didn't catch me in the same spot like the last one did.
ngl this might be the channel that fills that whole in my heart after it was ripped out with pink guy leaving
I have a problem you could help me with...

I don't have uni dynamite rice in my mouth right now....
Babish went from making me hungry to making me, a grown ass man, cry.


OMG. Masaharu Morimoto. I'm extremely jealous.
Bro Your Such An Awesome  Person!
The World Is Filled With Evil.
While Your Spreading Love Keep It Up, Brother!
So crazy!! The mother works for the school district here in Vegas and I've worked with her last school year... So awesome seeing you do this for these ladies bro....
When they said that the party will go through:
1:31 Fu- *TV Bleep*
*Back to regular programming* lol
Last episode... jazz cigarette 
This episode... stoner food
@1:30 I laughed like Julia Roberts when Richard Gere playfully clapped the jewelry box shut at her hand. 🤣
You dranking some cognac!?!?! I doth my cap
You make me cry every single episode. Wow 😭😭
Loving this series, the b roll shots, editing🔥  keep it up 👌🏼
Wow. This was amazing. Wow 👍 Babish, GOOD STUFF man!
Dude, LOVE this show! you seem like a fun dude to be around with :D keep it up!
Babish is a true rock star for a all of this 🤘🏻

Just kidding, this was so heartwarming and inspiring to watch. Great content from a clearly great man.
HOLY SHIT IS THAT CHEF MORIMOTO???? YESSSS fist pumps I'm so excited for the next episode!
Did you poison Morimoto?!?  How dare you, sir! :)
"I want to give to those around me, and it's hard when I can't even give to myself."
RESONATION
Just 1:23

Edit:I've never seen babish that pissed
Andrew, you are an amazing man. I love what you're doing with this series!
Wait, wait. Hold up real quick, that bit at the end there...

IS THAT CHEF MASAHARU MORIMOTO?!?!
Your videos feed the mind and soul 👌 
You rock!
Andrew, something I've noticed about your videos- and have been seeking out the correct words to convey it-- in particular the tone.. what I love , there's nothing pretentious about you. You don't at all seem like you're "selling a product" in any way.. a lot of the time it seems as though people in food entertainment will "jazz it up" so to speak. But you don't. You focus on information and truthfully conveying a love of food to the viewer. I have to say I appreciate that, especially in today's world. Please keep producing quality content as you have been, and I hope that all is well.
How you made a AD funny and worth watching is hilarious!  Great video as always Babby
Really love what you've done with this. Enjoy watching these as much as I enjoy cooking your recipes. Thank you my friend
I have loved watching your channel grow and progress over the years. When I feel down, you keep me going man, and for that, i am forever thankful. Keep being awesome Babish!!!
Sukki's shirt is sick! Happy for these strong women!
Ok so when they start making videos you have better post a link to their channel andrew
We cant stay here! This is batcountry!

You lovely lovely man, so proud to be supporting you
Thank you for doing these ❤️
Thank you so much, Andrew and Babish Crew.  I had been having a particularly rough dialysis treatment (where I frequently watch your videos to help pass the four hours) and this episode was a very necessary ray of sunshine.  Thank you for the work that you're doing, and please keep it up. 😃
Babish should get together with Gordon Ramsay sometime
The intro looks like an elaborate perfume ad
Thankk you for helping these sisters out, they remind me of my sister and I . Even though we have had our differences, we have gotten closer over the past couple of years and there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for her 💕
What a channel. Subscribed, I very much enjoy cooking and finding you has been a real gem. Your documentation of this journey was deep and very lively. More than just food. The spirit in the pan!
There’s a lot of YouTubers that I like, and that are good people. But I don’t know that there are any that are more genuinely nice than Babish. You deserve every subscriber that you have, keep it going.
Thank you for being you! You gorgeous shiny bald man!
I love this series sooooo much!  It's all about love and giving back and it reminds me to do so as well. Thank you for making this series sir Babish :')
I just love that last frase. "Keep cooking, I will if you will"
Dude I don't like to pick a favorite youtuber or anything like that, but you are really my favorite, every single video has been amazing, and you inspire me to cook more than I already do, I love you man, keep it up.
It’s so amazing to see how much your channel has grown! You are a true inspiration, and a wonderful human being. Thank you for everything you do.
This family is so beautiful. I love the girls piercing and her sisters rosy cheeks. Its so cute
I always knew Babby towel dried his luscious locks
Oh my god! This is amazing, you are becoming the new Ty Pennington but with less screaming
I don't know what you did to get where you are, but I'm so glad you're here.  Love your show.  Love your work.
So great to see a Youtube video with so many positive and good comments. That's when you know you're making a difference. The internet is normally so hostile and negative. Keep the good work, sir! You are awesome!
Smooth key toss bro. :) So cute. These new vids are wonderful.
Dam, your videos just keep getting better and better.
I'm not crying, you're crying.

I love these. I think that's my next goal.  Get so YouTube famous that I'm doing "giving back" videos.
This is the best channel on YouTube, the way he makes his cooking videos are entertaining even though I've never been into cooking, and now he is giving back to his fans.
Wow dude, you impress me more and more.
And sub 2 pewdiepie
Freaking excellent motivational interviewing, Andrew! Therapist Babish coming out.
Maybe you could make the Mississippi queen from regular show
It Will probably look pretty gross tho
Don't drink and watch being with babish.

Not even blaming the onions for this one.
haha, "this is an iguana, right?" good stuff man
@Binging with Babish please make the noodle soup from Kong Fu Panda!!!
😂😂😂 he kept calling her sucky even though she said suki 😂😂
Right on, Babish. You're the real deal. Keep on being you, brother. Much respect.
I finally figured out who you sound like. You speak in a very similar manner to Kevin Smith! Anyone else hear that? Awesome video by the way. Thanks for giving back to your community.
Come to Australia please! I would die ❤ we love you so much!
It's so cool honestly that you're not even really a millionaire or anything and you're still finding ways to practice philanthropy. Keep up the great work man.
Andrew you goddamn legend. You tapped into the same kind of thing that made me fall in love with Anthony Bourdain's career, and I can't wait to see you carry on his message and spread the love.
I'd ask "Who's cutting onions?!" but then I remembered who's show this is. 

Also, you are a great guy. Would love to meet you if you're ever in Park City, UT for Sundance
I live in vegas thank u for blessing us
3:30

Accurate representation of these episodes ravishing our emotions.
*"I'm no pun"

It was right there man.
This series is absolutely incredible!! The world needs more people like Andrew.
Babish is my spirit animal

Why is no one talking about the fantastically sly ad-monologue????
Andrew and the sisters were having a heartfelt conversation and the mom just chowing down 😂
I love you and what you do @Binging with Babashis TY so much! we love you! <3 <3
andrew! you should make a collab with Hiroyuki Terada!! that’d be an amazing collab imo
7:21 you're Sucky, right?
What an amazing person you are! I should not be watching this at work - I'm in tears for these lovely ladies. So very excited to see their first video.
I want babish to do the "very comfortable" thing every episode iz funny
In this episode, Babish becomes a licensed counselor
You know, i subbed for the cooking, but hell if this isn't some of the most feel-good content on the platform. You're the best dude. These are so uplifting.
You videos have been a part of my daily routine for quite some time now Babish. You continue to cease in the amazement, the world needs more people like you. Keep up the awesome work
You are one of the 5 men in the world I can really say I respect your a great man
I normally skip through promos but your voice is so nice I just stay and listen
Babish, my dude.. you are a truly amazing individual with such a heart of gold.
Andrew doesn't just cook our dream meals, he also teach us recipes and he also cures our souls.... Blessed with Babish
YOU'RE SUCH A SWEET PIE! OR COOKIE! OR DONUT MAYBE. Thanks.
Love this series, so great that you give back to your fans and also go into some really important issues!
this series kills me. so many beautiful feels <3 so many tears.
I looked up Best Friend on Yelp and one review said "Not kid friendly." Its in Las Vegas, nothing is kid friendly there lol.
Babish, helping random fans the right way.
Great cook, and great guy. Get you a man that can do both! Thank you for sharing
One of the few YouTubers who Is giving back to the community and his fans I love you man 💚

As amazing and heartwarming as this episode was, I cannot WAIT to see you cook with Morimoto.
Hey Babish could you do Lutefisk? From the King of the Hill episode “Revenge of the Lutefisk” (Season 3, Episode 21) it features cameos from Peggy Hills Frito Pie and Dale Gribble’s Lemon Bars.
Welcome to crying with Babish. 

Your weekly dose of wholesome tears.

I loved her reaction. Another great video!
Hey, I grew up in that desert.😂
Andrew and his platform is everything love should look like.  Thank you for  being a shining beacon of humanity!
Saint Babish
Patron saint of chefs and philanthropists!

I'm sorry, I just found funny how he misspronnounced her name.
loved the show
I really really like this series! Thank you for doing this
Was wondering when the Vegas episode would drop
This was fun, but I think the first episode will be hard to top given how deep your connection with your guest felt. Keep up the great work!
this is one of my favorite series on youtube. ive cried both episodes and my frozen over heart melts to see such kindness and generosity. keep up the incredible work Andrew and team. you're doing amazing.
Wizards of waverly place maxs sandwich
Wow man... so inspirational on so many levels... obviously the episode is so special, and what you did for these girls, but also how you took your own channel to a whole new level. Bravo man, you are truly a role model.
I freaked out a bit when I saw vin. I knew I recognised that messy hair from somewhere.
That was one of the best audible plugs I’ve ever heard
Hey Babish! Can you make Jake Peralta's Freedom Feast 2018 from Brooklyn Nine Nine
I dont know why anyone would dislike this, it's genuine, unscripted. Great Job <3
Being (drenched in tears and crying for 10 minutes straight) with Babish
babby is like the anti-bono legit. he could give some dude bus fare and it would inspire me to be a better person.
"Will you gamble your will for making food"

Babish: I am bold but not that bold
You are one amazing person and probably the best on this platform. Please keept it up. Lots of love from Greece.
I absolutely love how this new series is shaping up to be
There is so much love and enthusiasm for people, food, and connections that this series shows to the audience! Simply brilliant work!

IRON CHEF!! YOU GO BABISH! Masaharu Morimoto was always my favorite.
My fiancé and I sit down and watch your shows together all the time. Never apart. & this episode really has me crying. You are such a blessing and amazing man! Thank you for everything you are doing. 

Ps... I would LOVE for you to sign your cook book I have some time! Woot! How amazing would that be! I made your chicken recipe for my fiancé’s birthday and it was good!! I struggled but it turned out awesome! 

Thanks so much!!!

I am so glad to see that you are a classy man and wear a bow tie Babish! Btw Vinny  you're FREAKING HOT~! Lastly though, these videos are heartfelt and truly an embrace to your honest and gracious nature :)
You’re in vegas!?!?? My city!
Dude let me just say that you are incredible. It's so amazing being a witness to a person with a platform, giving back to regular people. You are truly deserving of your success and are such an inspiration. Please never stop Binging.
Good job Andrew. You’re doing amazing things out there.
Food brings family together Babish bringing people together
Babish is the best kind of people spreading the love

You suffer from pun defficiency,
I suffer from awesomeness deficiency, You don't.
You are doing something amazing Andrew. It's amazing to see you help others and give people that push to follow their dreams. I always strive to help others even when I don't have much myself.

Can you do Chang's prison lunch from Orange Is The New Black???

It's difficult to find a person like Babish in this harsh world. He has a golder heart. 

Respect from Assam,India.
This series is so good. (Whee can I get that intro music from)
A part of me wants to be envious of these people for getting to eat with Babish and receiving expensive gifts. But I can't, it's just too damn wholesome and inspirational. Loving the series so far, keep it up!
Wow, the resemblance between you and your dad is striking
Man, if therapists also cooked nice meals for you
You are truly such an amazing person 😁❤
I'm not crying, you are...
Love this series though, it's a beautiful thing to see people with huge followings using that to help people in need 💕💕. You should totally do an episode helping the homeless, maybe go to a shelter and cook everyone the best damn meal they've ever had!
I love what you do - really inspiring, positive and funny! Keep it up!
Grats on four million lil' chefs, Babby.
Beautiful soul Suki and her sister is. Thank you for taking some stress/pain off their shoulders. Food is a healer and way to connect with anyone and everyone. ❤️
So, I was already Babish obsessed. Now I find out hes even more amazing then I thought. And I am DEFINITELY trying to holler  (I'm from wv we have hollers we dont holla) at Vinny. Hey Vinchismo!
Andrew! Babish!!!! Omg!!! Bruh!!! 😭 keep doing it!!!

Do butter on a pop tart! From family guy!
That WRITING at the beginning of the Audible ad tho....

Oh babish. Why are you such a great person?
What did we do to deserve you

Thanks for the spoiler warning. Nothing personal to Vinny but I prefer him as a formless enigma.
Babish you beautiful soul you. <3
Those girls are super sweet. That's awesome, babish
Hearing Roy talking about his mum's kimchi and food in general is an absolute testament to what food is all about and why it is so important
Love how the end felt like an Anthony Bourdain episode
A tv network has to pick this up and get more budget, not to production but to what you’re giving to people, absolutely amazing what you’re doing
IM NOT CRYING. YOU'RE CRYING.
He just call the good fortune cat a Tiki mug?

You missed an opportunity to say gambling with babish 🤷‍♀️
Damn, 2 for 2 with making me tear up. Great series by a great man
Your generosity warms my heart. You’re a role model man.

Bro my heart :')
Being with Babish - I'm not crying, you're crying
Man this premise of an internet show is just amazing, but not as good as a reality show featuring flat earthers finding the edge of the planet.
Andrew, you’re a home chef. Stop making me cry!
I guess I'm just gonna cry at every episode of this.
I’m loving these videos Babi! I can call you babi, right?
Babish  in all the merch looked uncomfortably similar to Brett from Cowchop..
Jesus christ babish, I'm crying STOP
Please tell me why /anyone/ disliked this video? honest question.
Can you stop making this grown man cry. Why do I click on these!! <3
I love this series of how we can hear what other people been struggling through and I can understand how that feels and whoever is next in this series you deserve this
Hey Babish can you cook the dishes served in, The Goodfellas?
Andrew looks exactly like his father
"One toke over the line sweet Jesus, one toke over the line"
When their YouTube channel goes up be sure to update the description so we can find it!

I could say so many superlatives about you Babish. But for me i think the greates compliment is simply: You sir are a thouroughly good human being!
Andrew you are by far one of the best people I've ever seen on this site you inspired me to start cooking and I'm sure alot of others as well. Then you go and do this out of the blue your a good person man. Thank you for your great contribution to the community and to my life.
Roy, Babish, I think the only one missing from the episode is Bourdain to make it whole.
Good Guy Babish II: Bab Harder.
Love to see it. Still confused as to why people would dislike something like this
The oscars part is pure gold
I love this series. Please keep doing these
Babish Eye for the Binging... ¿pal?
Wasn’t the title “gambling in Vegas” just like 15 minutes ago?
This is so inspiring dude. Your awesome.
Feels man WP
I like these videos Babish, and I know you can support a lot of people.

Be careful, there's more to people than you can learn in a day, you're not a therapist.

I don't want you to be a romantic.
Holy crap is that Iron Chef Morimoto in the teaser?
My boyfriend's name is Andrew. He is proud to share the name with a guy this great.
Babish why am I crying?! 😭
Dude this vid is amazing.
teehee Sukki is so cute oh my god
Some YouTubers giving out cold hard gift cards. He's giving love and help
Honestly god bless you Andrew
This was so wholesome. Good on you, Babish! :)
Babish deserves the world. 

But the world does not deserve Babish.
This is the content that swooped up to fill the void Bourdain left. Thanks Babish.
Andrew, plug their channel ASAP
I love these episodes! Keep doing great things Babish!
CHEF MORIMOTO?!?!?!? OH MY GODDDDDDDDDD HE IS MY FAVORITE! EEEEEEK! Next weeks episode is going to be the best!
the dream team of Masaharu Morimoto and Andrew Rea is everything I need right now~ My childhood and my adult cooking icons in one space!
Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas is a great book, glad to hear you were enjoying a great read Andrew! Two of my idols in one video, Hunter S Thompson And Andrew Rea!
Babby I'm cryin in the club I'm so happy for them and I love all of you
I've been a fan since your first Parks and Rec episode for a reason. You're a good cook and a good man with a good heart Andrew. Props to you and all the folks that make this channel possible.
1:31 startled me...
I want this show to get millions of views as well as your cooking stuff! What youre doing is amazing! I love that you remember all your fans even after getting so big~

Wow, that is a wonderful thing you were doing.
Who's that ninja cutting the onions? Oh, it's just Babish preparing his next meal.
When I stayed in Vegas for a week, I had the luxury of going to an amazing burger place called Fuku Burger. Highly recommended!
Good man Babish! Awesome episode and great story. BUT! Will we get the full episode about Babish family reunion?? It seemed like you (well, Vinny) got quite a lot of shots for that montage))
Love when he asked you Sucky right? Lol
it’s moments like these, seeing people helping others out, makes life worth living for and making the world a better place           :)

You are amazing Babish!! I love youu
Dude when I’m in NY again, all I want to do is shake your hand.... and maybe give you a hug.
Both, Binging and Basics, show Andrew helping people through hard times by getting them interested in a new activity that takes their mind off their pain and brings them joy. This series shows Andrew giving both directly. Either way, it makes my soul warm. Awesome job, mate. Keep shining bright!
i am currently pooping.
Dude love the content and you’re f**king awesome keep it up!
You should make "the world's best burger" from "How I Met Your Mother"
I literally started watching your show about 3 weeks ago and i feel in love to be honest. I love to learn different dishes and will hope to meet u personally man. You’re awesome especially when u make the steak which is my favorite food of all time.
oprah is nothing compared to andrew coming out swingin'

I love that you're doing this Babish!
Roy hitting me in the feels.

Great job man. Great job.
This show is qulckly becoming Babbling Ugly Cry in Front of the Computer because of the Feels with Babish. Please keep this awesomeness flowing!
Maybe I should finally start cooking again.
Wholesome hours. This is such a beautiful idea Babish.
I love how far you've come.
Wishing Sukki and her family all of the very best =) Hard times always pass, it can be hard to see it when you're in it though. Good luck ^^

Bfamilytherapysession with Babish
This week on Bawling my eyes out With Babish...
omg babish stop making me cry
Mr Beast more like Mr Babish lol
Where can I submit a form for my friend, he’s a really great guy (also named Andrew ironically) but he’s going through a tough time right now, his dog had to be put down about 3 weeks ago that they had had for while, he had to quit his job to get a new one to support his newly born child, he been the father figure for majority of my life, taking me out to cook dinner with him teaching me new things about life and food as we go. We haven’t cooked in almost a year because of how busy he has been he is always giving and giving and I’ve been trying to find a way to pay him back for all that he has done for me, this would be perfect. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did.
Banish is a top man!
God I have never loved this man more
Babish! Keep this going! You are amazing! Thank you for being such an amazing person!
Love this series!
best thing to do is to get her a gym membership. physical wellbeing is linked so heavily with mental health
Love seeing you doing more stuff outside of your kitchen!
I'm about 2 and half hours away from vegas I was born and raised in that desert its not that bad lol
2:23 he has no hair!
havent even seen it yet and wanna say i love you babby
am i the only one who thought that these daughters doenst even looked at her mother ones?
Good on ya sir.  Cheers.
I'm subbing to their channel
They say if your early enough, babish will notice you
Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern
7:19 Did he just call her “Sucky“? :D

7:23 Again! :'D

 Come on, she already told you how it's pronounced, dude.
Good Guy Andrew/Babbish
This series is like a combination of Binging with Babish, Oprah, and one of those Netflix food documentaries. I love it
Andrew you're a great person.
why you gotta make me cry man
Who is that fatass she been eating too much
Babish that's why we love you man !
If you came to Portland I’d actually pass out. From the food, your cool too though Babby 😉
Love seeing the evolution of this channel.
I find your lack of puns disturbing
This series is so heart warming
your like Oprah dude, Baboprah, Oprish, I cant find a good one but you get that point.
Ive said it many times but never actually displayed it in public; Andrew is such a beautiful human being that I just want to pay him to narrate my life and watch him cook. Been a fan since the very beginning and my god man, youre just straight up piledriving the shit outta life. Keep doing what youre doing cause seeing you this happy makes me happy a lot. I just wish I could thank your mom for creating such an awesome human being. Love you man
Love this series!!!
1:31 when i slam the door into my finger
Undercover Boss, but with food and Babish isn't undercover.
That segue into the sponsor at the end triggered me like when Julien triggers Jenna Marbles with his segues 😂😂
I like this theme of babish being "comfortable".
Ohh you stayed at the MGM Signature? I miss the days of having a time share 😌
3:28 that's me beating my MEAT.
Love that fear and loathing reference at the end
im crying into my tea
4:10 Best.Bit.Ever.
Babish cooks the entirety of Las Vegas
These are great, especially since the people in these early ones have no idea what's coming :)
Does anyone have that asparagus recipe?! Babish?
THESE EPISODES MAKE ME CRY
Another banger like always 🙏
When they started their Channel, will you please give us a Link to it Babish?
I came here to to cook... Not to feel 😂 😂 😂
Nice editing mate
This was wholesome as heck <3
Are all of the episodes going to make me weep? I dont know if I can handle it lol
Real quick, does Babish actually drink anything but alcohol? 80% he had alcohol nearby. It's not too late for help Babish.
16:06 takes a deep breath in  "HE WHO MAKES A BEAST OUT OF HIMSELF GETS RID OF THE PAIN OF BEING A MAN!"
its funny cause the family is huge
i love this man
Vinnyyyyyyyy we miss you bud!!!
1:25 to 1:32 is me almost everyday for this year
Another 2 weeks, another punch of emotions and feels.
Babish you are simply the best people. Suki, Gabrielle, good luck on your channel. Be sure to have Babish on your premiere episode, or whenever everyone's schedules allow it.
You are amazing
Dont hit her wait till the camera stops rolling.
video cuts
I spend way too much time on YouTube and you're one of the channels I've just loved to watch for a long time. I have a lot of respect for the work you and other channels do, I hope to have a successful channel of my own someday. All that said, what you're doing with Being With Babish is so amazing and special. You taking your success and putting it into others lives really shows the kind of person you are. I really respect you.
Oprahing with Babish <3
Besides the move, Sukki's story of her 2018 was very close to what had happened to me. And that story hit me so hard. Though things are getting better, I really hope that things get better for Sukki and her family. I wish them all good luck on their journey.
We need updated when they start that YouTube channel!
No breaking or entering in this one but still 10/10
Don’t worry Babish, imPUNtence happens to everyone.
Counseling with Babish
wow... aamazing <3
promote waw i think you spent more money than you got from creating a video
you are a true god sent, you know that?
Can I just point out that my emotions can't take these videos at 9am on a Friday morning. My 4yr old can't understand why I'm crying into my coffee but telling her I'm not sad, I'm happy.
i love this
I was not ready! TEARS!
Her living in DC didn’t happen so this could happen.
Beard and Roasting in Las Vegas
What a good man. Bringing people together and reminding people of the important things in life.
You should cook The life of David Gale... his last meal

If your still here in Vegas hmu
Babish, please please please tell me that those lemon panko asparagus will be on a future episode of Binging or Basics!
That’s iron chef morimoto at the end, right? I can’t wait for the next episode!
1:00 made my brain to a triple take
YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE YOUR DAD!
My heart.... 💜
Food, family, and friends, nothing is more important! The like button isn't good enough for this message YouTube needs a heart/love button for the rare jewels like this video
Being with Babish is Dr. Phil for millennials
wow! I live in vegas

The most happy show on YouTube
I LOVE BEST FRIEND!!!
My grandma makes the best kimchi I’ve ever had she’s 100% Korean

the fake excitement looks on babish's face is priceless.
Babish is bearded oprah confirmed!
This being still in its early start of a series within your channel, I gotta say babish, you are a hell of a man, and an amazing person all around. Seeing this series proves my thoughts that I had watching your regular stuff. Keep on keeping on doing you!!!!!!
I am enjoying this content so much.
so excited for this series
This video was so heartwarming. I want to be Suki and her sisters best friends! What is their youtube channel?!
These videos are so wholesome, they're really inspirational
You could hit me with a car and id apologize for being in the way
In CREDIBLE 2:13
I'm only halfway through the episode but the biggest thing that draws me to Andrew/Babish is his unadulterated love of chef's, their methods, and food.  As I have personally always been drawn to watching artisans practice their craft, I also have been drawn to people who have such a passion for what they are doing and relentlessly move forward in their craft.  A/B is one of those people.  I personally have always been a "jack of all trades, master of none" type of personality.  I know a lot about how to work on things, how things work, and what to do next but haven't found something that overtly consumed me like cooking has done for you.  I keep plugging along and finding new interests, hoping to find mine but in the meantime, I'll enjoy my off-time watching you explore yours.  Very happy to see your channel come to an impressive level of success and I cheers you to the future of what you are going to become.  Best of luck A/B and stay humble.
I wanna go to VEGAS TO SEE CILINE Dions Show it,s been on my bucket list sences my hubby passed. Sorry but when i see Vegas i melt with envey.😍😘💙
Make the Orange Marmalade from Paddington!!
God,  babish you are amazing

Binging with Oprah?
Babish the next Oprah yo
Cooking with Oprah
My Friday morning feel good. Thanks Vinny and Babish, love you guys.
was that iron chef masaharu morimoto at the end?
I didn't understand the oscar aftterparty bit. Can anyone explain?
is that Jon Favreau at 2:37 ????
The air suddenly got very dusty.
It’s okay you didn’t go to the after party you don’t need them
This was actually cool
When you need an excuse to go to vegas...
if you come to the Uk then you have to come to the Northeast as in Teesside/Middlesbrough for a proper parmo they are basically heaven
We don't deserve this man
I want to be able to make good consistent asparagus.  I have made good asparagus twice in my life.  It is a life goal.  I have tried it roasted on the grill, cooked in aluminum foil, broiled with garlic and lemon juice, steamed, in a pressure cooker, and every recipe that I find.  It's a skill I haven't mastered yet.  What is the trick?  And yes I know you're supposed to remove it from hear before it's fully done.
Babish, you should do an audio book
when did Babish become Opera
That spit take was hilarious
I live in Vegas
Babish turning into a YouTube Oprah :')
That scream was beautifully cut

Caring with babish :,)
Even after all this success, he’s still humble enough to make light of himself, and willing to use his success to serve. Love it. An inspiration for us in the trenches.
This is how you take over YouTube the right way.
I love how Babish is able to be so incredibly giving without being cocky about it. God bless.
I could listen to you talk forever 😳
Executive beverage director...... Or bar tender for short!!
I’m so down for Babish being the Oprah of YouTube
My comment might get buried but I just wanted to express my respect for you in not only making these people feel so validated and special, in that the gifts you give are so beneficial and not just ritzy or to look good. You give them what they need and are working so hard for. Thanks for being a light in the dark, man.
The FACT that you WRAPPED your BALD HEAD with a fuckiddyfickiddy TOWEL.
My heart just melts
I think you should make a "Coffee Jelo" i wonder if you can make that

Thank you so much for doing this series, Andrew. It's such a heartwarming thing to watch you bring so much joy and happiness to those who are in a serious need for it. You are the genuine article of what it means to be a decent human being and hope to carry some of that givingness to those in my own life.
Come to Arizona Babish!
Blubbing with Babish
I need the youtube channel
Yet again, I'm all up in my feels about this. I'm from Vegas and it means a lot to me to see how strong we continue to be despite the odds. I can't thank you enough for spreading good will and kindness with this new series. As someone who has gone through similar hard times, I know that this can change everything for someone. You go Sukki and Gabrielle!
I wish I could love these video's and not just like them.

These are so inspirational!

Good guy Bab does it, again.
My favorite part 1:28
When she said that she wants to give to everyone but she can’t even give to herself. I felt that in volumes.
The new Ellen
FANTASTIC. Nothing less
What's their YouTube channel though
So are we gonna pretend that 1:20 didnt happen? 😂

Babish keepin' it real!!! Yeah!!!
Am I the next episode?

😭😭😭😭
Sukki is the sweetest person ever!
Something is off on the color balance for this video, everything is way too yellow. Especially in shots of the food at the restaurant, Roy literally looks like a Simpsons character
You are an outstanding human being Babish, the world would be a better place with more people like you.
Come to Puerto Rico.  We can make pernil, empanadas, arroz con gandules, y bacalaitos.
Food looked real delicious
Do chowder foods.
Lmao the fact that babby said sucky all the time instead of Suuki
Send them to the ranch! Send them to the ranch!
Right after the first being with babish i actually bought a Vespa- its just 50ccm but still. Its my baby

Ah my home town...glad to see you enjoyed yourself!
Hey babish ...maybe tea and crompits from borderlands 2 ??? That would be fun what with the remasterd coming out of the first game and the 3 game comeing out
I wish i can cook like you and roy
Dont need to feed these 2 anymore
Binging with Babish sounds like some hard rock band name, but the lead singer has charm and one big hell of heart.
Who are you, Ellen?? No, you’re even better - you’re indescribable!
Amazing.
103K views. If there aren't at LEAST 103k subscribers on their channel when it first starts off I'll be very disappointed
I read “surprising a fan with vegan hotel suite”
MEAT (and I can’t express this enough) CROWN FROM CHOWDER
15:45 that was beautiful
So if we are going with these “B names with Babish”, how about bonging, bombing, buttoning, bitching, etc.
Awww! Great women!!
Do a video with matty matheson
Come visit me in Japan!
Te amo , estás re fuerte

Mr. Rea could have been a therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist.   All those episodes of Frasier have paid off!  Oprah, you are finished… Dr. Phil, you are finished… this is the future!
What an evolution of the channel
He kept calling her Sucky
When are you going to make Troy's Casserole from Community?
Go go babi
❤️
kkonas lul
I came down here to watch you to cook! Not to made me cry.
wonderful
If you want to smoke a shitload of weed you can come be with me.
This is so wholesome. The world needs more people like Babish.
What a guy this Babish fellow is. just what a guy.
2:40 is that chef
pekking duck plzzzzzz mannnn

SUKI NOT sucki
babish went too far
Am I the only one freaking out at Iron Chef Miyamoto-san at the end? Yeah? Oh, okay...
Babish was pun'd and done
You just can't stop calling her sucky can't you babish? 😂,Its suki not saki or sucky
Since you're expanding into new shows, how about a series called "Binging with Babish" where you search for cool things on Bing? You could get some sweet Microsoft sponsorship money and everything...
<3
No one going to comment about 2:19
"Don't Hit me!" "You can hit her when the camera stops rolling, Wait till the camera stops rolling" camera cuts "
So when are we going to see Bringing the Babish where Babish goes to different parts of the world and fans guide him.
goat
I remember the first day I saw Binging. I was watching a clip of Frasier and had just been binging a ton of Gordon Ramsey videos and got linked to his channel and over the past almost year and a half, being on dialysis and waiting for a kidney transplant, he has brought me so much joy and delight. Keep this series up man, it’s life changing!
succy
1:30 When you realize you forgot your keys at home and your already at school
Colleges and universities need to do more to help students with mental health.  Depression ended my higher education in a very messy way.  With the proper resources, things might have gone differently.  I relate to this a lot.
Woooo Babie
6:33 is that tay-k in the middle?
love you. that’s all.
WACK
The part about her not having a job and a career really hit close to home. I hope she can find her way in life
Class act
This guy is gonna start a cult and call it believing with babish
This ain’t Being with Babish this is Feeling with Babish.
the biggest man right now. kudos to u babish
food is love
Am I the only one that noticed Roy was on the worth it brunch episode?
Guys I need help I burned the water
1:10 so im guessing that amazing Babish beard stems through the family? Along with that soothing voice.
Please please please let us know when their channel launches!!!!!
Was that Masaharu Morimoto?!?
link their channel/podcast?
Farfou omg bro!!!!
Bawling with babish
I learned from Greg at How to Drink that the reason your cocktail didn't taste good is that you didn't spill half of what's in the jigger.
I need to watch more basics to learn how to unify people
You are a punderachiever.
Babish you are one hell of a guy.
Sucky
FAAH
Being with Babish???? Naw.......Giving with Babish! Much gooder.... (Yes that is not a word) (I say it a lot so it's OK) name change is needed for this segment.
I want to learn how to cook I watch you everyday I want to learn from you cooking  it's my passion in my dream
Those big girls seem manipulative
This channel = the best god diddly darn channel I’ve ever seen. You’re honestly the coolest son of a gun I’ve ever seen. You’re so nice and treat all you’re fans like friends and family. Love this channel, love you, and Vinny.
Babish every time i watch this series i end up crying like a bubbling baby. i’ve never felt so invested into a series.
Gods plan with babish
I want to see the chocolate off of raising hope be made
It’s so crazy I live in Vegas, and so many people come here for like so many things to gamble or for the night and lie vacations. It’s just crazy how many YouTube videos there are of like you youtubers coming here to do random shit or stuff like this to give back crazy....and I never meet anyone. David dorbrik comes so much I wanna meet him and you
dear Babish. Very fond of you. See what I did there
cough
The phrase "artfully un-fussy" at 5:20 was a bit of a revelation. It perfectly sums up the style of dining I prefer: Good food, without all the pretension that goes into the more stereotypical "haute cuisine" presentations that are associated with being a foodie.
Babish: A more sophisticated, skinny Somecallmejohnny.
Babish is so wholesome
My ohhh my...caught me off guard at 1:31
Babish the type of guy to season a girls coochie with Kosher Salt before he eats it
Where do you go to email him?
You should make the key lime pie from natural born killers
Do you shampoo or body wash your head
Babish turning into Oprah out here
Nice surprise! You should do surprise another fan in Europe maybe?
Have they started their channel yet? I have no idea how long ago this was filmed
What’s their channel called?
 The girls I mean. Let’s give them some subs!
They’re all actors!
Can you come to INDIA, maybe you could help me :) just know you're a star.
Damn. Babish is the best of what YouTube has to offer.
Babish is the new Oprah
This is the Queer Eye of food
Thank god for Vin
I went to school with Sukki cx it’s trippy to see someone you know from real life on a popular channel
It’s interesting that you started Binging with the intention of a cooking show on YouTube with a bigger focus on the food than the host, then people loved you as the host, and now you’ve got a show titled “Being with Babish”, a focus on you as the host.
Ok i wanna see gordon ramsey and binging do like a collab i feel like that would be cool as shit
Ohhh shit y’all ep2 Is here!
Babish you’re bald Oprah.
Lucky sonuva-
Link to their youtube channel eh?
pls surprise me with an AK 47 my brother plays fortnite thanks
i liked babish making the drink, it’s cool when youtubers show us that they’re not gods at everything
Anyone else wanna try that henny cola slushee?
Since you’re a Frasier fan, I double dog dare you to make some of Sherry’s mock apple pie
being with babish > ellen
Why does this video have dislikes tho.....seriously!
Come to Chile please!!! I’ll take you to the best places to eat !!!!
Drop the channel name when it launches please!!
Andrew, you have got to be the kindest person in the planet. You are human and you show it. You embrace your flaws and inspire 4 million people on this globe to follow their passion. You treat everyone you meet as a friend. You have found the true balance of life, between managing your life, your channel, your social life, and providing opportunities for others with just one thing, food. Food is secret to life and all of its glory and mystery.
“Hey Sucky”
”it’s suki”
“So Sucky...”
What's their channel though? :)
Babish is the best he deserves a tv 📺 show!!! He gives back to people instead of flexing all the stuff he can get with YouTube money. Gosh he’s the best!!! I don’t really need anything but gosh I wish I could meet him!! Babish please do a good tour or a meet and greet somewhere
Babish is the bomb.
Too bad YouTube is oversaturated with creators and commentators. Good luck
I thought the video was about the last veg dish
Garnachas
That hair style does not work for her. But nevertheless Andrew, amazing video!
How are you able to support these people?
Darn it Andrew, not a good look to be ugly crying in the office.
This brought back so many memories of my grandfather who passed away last year. He was an amazing baker and would make 20 pies just to give them away. He taught me how to be a kind yet strong individual and I miss him very much. You’d never walk into his house without smelling freshly baked bread and on occasion cakes and cookies. I love you and I wish you were still here grandpa buddy.
HI, YOU’RE SUCKY?!
I want to know their YouTube channel and or podcast please link it
You know this is not fake rehearsed video like many others because the people are just acting random without tense. You can see the mom still eating when the girl is talking serious stuff and they are not tearing up every time they open their mouth although what they are dealing with is really tough. Love this channel!
You were in town and didn't  call me? I'm hurt....
Mohave Wasteland? Please tell me we're gonna get a Fallout New Vegas episode of Babish
Why do you keep on calling her Sucky eventhough she said its pronounced Suki? :P
And
But it's not hot in the mojave yet. Why are you wiping your forehead?
Why dies Suki remind me of a bigger version of my sister and not black
So I started watching your YouTube channel for the good from shows....then not after long I started cooking the recipes for my daughter's and wife..... Babby you really do change people and have for sure given me and my family an appriciation for the art of cooking that my family growing up did not have . Now when my daughters and i sit down and watch an episode they say they want to cook when their older. With u hitting 4 million and giving back it is awesome to see you still passing that passion you have on to your fans in real life to.
Plz post an update when they get going on whatever those two do next babish
7:35 SHE HIT HER AND THE EDITED IT OUT XD
Please do a follow up with them when you can!
My tears keep running down like a pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Even though Babish has over 4 mil subs, he still shows that he is a human. The food and the humanity brings family together, as was perfectly illustrated in this video. Props man.
is that your brother at 1m on your right? he looks like thanos
When their YouTube channel comes out do you think you. Could let us know :D I’d love to support them!
Besides the youtube/podcasting stuff, what did Babish give to them? When he was talking about they moving together. I'm not from US (english isn't my native language) and couldn't understand what he said. :(
I damn near lost it when you called her "sucky" You must have just disappeared into yourself a little, ha!
just got back from vegas yesterday, would have been cool to see babish. also would have been cool to win 300$
When babby told them he’s gonna take care of first last month and security again that touched me. My mom a few years back was a bit behind on rent and we had to move into a hotel. 4 years my mom tried her hardest to save for all the shit you need for a new apartment and finally she got us one. My mom told me that she struggled all those years but it was worth it cause she’s got an apartment she loves. Sure they up our rent every year but eh we’re making it work.
Shoulda been punished for that poor pun prowess.
once they get their channel up can you send out a link so we can show some more lo e babish?
Andrew I swear if you don’t tell us their YouTube channel the moment it comes out I will sue, these girls deserve every single subscriber
Mom's just there lmao
Anyone else noticed that the thumbnail got changed or its only me ? 🤔🤔
Come on, Andrew!  You're killin' me over here with the chopping of onions!
I feel bad for these woman but their were people that deserved it more. I feel for them but getting kicked out of online school is really hard.
binging with babish bring faith back into humanity one meal at a time
please let us know when they make their channel! or to gabi and suki, COMMENT with your new show, I cant wait to see what you guys create! :') really amazing new series, babish!
She graduated from Western, but I never saw here at school.
Haha stoners eat great babby, don’t be surprised
We can’t stop here, this is bat country
Was anyone else hoping to see babish get a facial?
These two are so cute.  I’d watch it.
I am partially blind from the reflective bald heads in this video.
Hello are you sucky 7:22
Get 10 Million
Please cross-register yourself
Can you let us know if you hear when they start their channel so we can check it out?
W
Andrew isn’t wearing a hairnet.
When she said she wants to give to those around her but it’s hard when she can’t even give to herself, motherfuck I felt that in my bones
hrm Some people tryin' to take advantage of Babish's giving, and that's not cool.
Can we start a petition or something to make Babish a saint or something like that? Who is with me?!
I can see why she has mental health issues with a mom who gives off nothing but hate vibes. She just keeps eating with a stone face while her daughters weep with joy. I know they have to edit for time, but knowing Babish, he certainly would have included anything nice mom said.
You are amazing and your beards always on point. Great job
Damn it Babish! I didn't think I was gonna cry today. That was an amazing video! You are a wonderful human being and you run the best channel on YouTube.
Andrew is one of maybe 5 of the only good YouTubers
Thank you, Babs. I know I wholeheartedly benefit from seeing such acts of kindness and generosity. And I know others do too. In a world where negativity gets all the press and attention, I am so blessed to see you sowing goodness into the world and humbly giving back to those who helped support your channel. Keep up the great work bro, I hope the be able to give back at the same capacity you do some day.
Nacho hat from the simpsons
Yes yes omg
Gosh 😭😭😭😭... this is so kind... you cooked them a meal which is the ultimate form of love! Poor girl, I'm proud of her for speaking up about her mental health , and doing things to change it. It's brave! She seems like such a creative person- wish her luck!
so weird seeing vinny away without brad, excited for whats to come though lol
Who's cutting those damn onions again?
Can we just take a moment for the theme song because it’s a bop
Babish you are one honorable and one bad as MOFO!!!
wait...is that Iron Chef Morimoto, or just someone who kinda looks like him at a glance? he didn't look at the camera much so it's kinda hard to tell
How about banging with Babish
More like Crying With Babish.
Nice.
The little babies wearing BWB asttfhyijgvblpiydafyuin cuties and I want a son now
Therapist Babish?
Sooki like cookie or Suki like two key? I’m glad your voice over got it right. Sweet girls, I hope they find their paths.
Who are the 316 dinks that gave this a thumb down?
Being with babish , basics with babish , binging with babish what’s next gaming with babish ?
This series is what food is about. Love, giving love, and being with friends and family. I love what you’re doing. Keep this up man.
You’re a good man. It’s awesome to see how genuine and kind you are towards your fans. Keep up the good work
Mr. Babish that was really nice of you what you did in this video I say that was very special and that's nothing but god , God bless you Mr. Babish.
Damn Babby, you’re the best. You’ve gone beyond being a great cooking channel and have blossomed intonkne of the most relatable and human channels on YouTube. I loved every damn second of this
I thought I was the only person left in the entire world that pronounced aunt that way.
I was just in Nevada.
Can you do a haircake
You are an amazing dude
. How do you afford all this? Is it all from sponsoring and youtube views? So glad you are doing it though, it’s fantastic and I will follow you in all your future adventures.
That gold Rolex tho
Damn it Babish, this is just too wholesome for me! What are these "feelings" I'm having?!
Can we get babish on Hot Ones!?!?
Was just there lol.
Iron Chef Morimoto?!
ANDREW! You do you!! Keep doing what you're doing and be yourself!!
Babish was here. So close yet so far.  •_•
Bawling with Babish
I am beyond here for Being With Babish!!! Shoot I’d do anything with Babish! I love this
That was a little PUNderwhelming when it came to wordplay.
Later the camera man was killed because of a flying jeans button
Mom looks so young!
Man really never takes his apron off
Waaaait what was that in the intro, you gotta keep the apron on 24/7 for true Babish power
Babish: Son of the gun..

*Sip

>silence
OMG...this is so heartwarming. Babby, you're the champ.
When we gonna get a gun show? Range days with Babs? xD
You're literally an angel.
I want to help people just like you and most on YouTube.
He doing the lords work
Nothing is better than coming home to Being with Babish



Or Binging with Babish
Around the globe??? Hope you come to Korea and try some great chicken
Move over Dr. Phil
Being with babish more like memeing with babish
Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! 💖
I think you need to try Indonesian food...
<3
She looks like allessi from jojo part 4
With all the controversies and absolutely stupid stuff people are doing and saying in modern times.... Thank you Babish! Videos like this make the world a better place and give a much needed break from stupidity. Thank you.
Hey Andrew, can we get a heads up beforehand about mentions of suicide and things like that, it can be a big trigger for some people, so could you please put a warning for things like that, thank you~Cole
Hey man 
Idk what to say here 
 I would love to tell about this Syrian kid who finished high school with a 3.8 GPA during the war and managed to be a finalist in the science Olympiad 
I am that kid and I can't get a college access due to the current laws where they just want u to join the army and die
Any help u do is highly appreciated 
Also thanks for teaching how to cook and teaching me that cooking can be something other than following a recipe
Been a fan since u had around 500k subs
Congrats on 4million subs
All love!
Me😊
Come on! He barely helped two girls who barely needed it, and made a middle aged women have an uncomfortable meal on camera! Sorry but this series is pretentious and over-reaching
Sucky
I'm happy that he's trying to make others happy.  I'm just a bit out of sorts on the difference between the episode of "here's a Vespa, Macbook, Year pass to Disney and a meal" v. "Here's  a meal".
"Wait till the cameras stop rolling"
jumpcut
If you have a hard time coming up with puns, does that mean you're Pun-der Qualified? 








I'll see myself out...
Dont know about yall but im really loving this new seriesi guess youd say
Babby why you making me cry man
Babby, you are one of the coolest human beings ever
Next series: Breeding with Babish
Gambling with Babish, sounds good
Why doesn't Youtube have a Love react?
Babish is the guy you can just open up to the moment he walks into a room. He shows up and everyone wants to talk to him.
Hey I live in Vegas
Link their yt Bro x
(Going) Broke with Babish
No offense I think what you do is great but it's just not the same as the cooking part so sadly have to unsub
I love how Babish kept mispronouncing Sukki's name as "sucky" to mess with her it was really cute and funny
I don't want to sound like I'm making anything up or that I'm desperate. But does anyone know what email they reached babish on?
I don't like the reality show format, the sobbing, it's just not for me. Sorry Babish
Am I the only one who feels like, yeah.. She called Babish because of her sister not being well and all... But also, because she KNEW that if he picked her up, he would get the equipment for the youtube thing, he being a youtuber? I really feel like this was a top class manipulation.. As for Babish. Man you can't be nicer.. You are seriously one of the most beautiful and kind hearted persons out there, you deserve to rule heaven.
Some mental health issues come from lack of exercise
Ith a peeg
Someone get this god a tv deal. Babish for 2020
hey babish! good video! i really hope you got mt reccomendation! if not dosent matter xD have a great weekend all of you! and keep the amazing, delicious work up babish!
I love Park MGM 😍 I tried some pork tacos from that restaurant and they were delicious! They also have Eatly now and oh man do they have some amazing food!
Babby stop, you’re making me cry! 😩
Thanks for having this on your main channel and not making an entirely new channel for it
I'm crying, but also starving. This was such a great video ❤️
Now im going to wipe my tears and go to wegmans to get some chicken thighs
Hey we need vin for...government reasons

Eddie Murphy hamburger
Subscribed!
I want your beard.
The Oscars haven't been important/have sucked for decades now; no big loss. Good episode though.
india when
you kinda look like ryan reynolds
move over Oprah Babish is here
Does anyone know the exact song in the intro? I know its by Broke For Free, but I can't find the exact song. Thanks!
I think Babish is the youtuber equivalent of Keanu Reeves like if you ask Babish for a picture he will take one with you and doesn’t matter how many people are asking for pictures in the one area he will keep saying “yeah sure “ I think he is one the most kind hearted youtuber/cook I’ve ever watched
Nothing like a little self-satisfied ego stroking to tell everyone what a stand-up guy you are.
Thanks Babish for this type of content on this platform! A really full hand of heart for you - Keep it up Brother! <3
This is beautiful Andrew☺️ Thanks for sharing
I love this new series! It’s so wholesome to see you helping these people out! :) Also you are hilarious
gambling with gabish
You were in Vegas???? I work there!!!!
All these comments and nobody mentioning f#%*ing Iron Chef Morimoto at the end?!?
Roy Choi is such a legend. Wow
That cutoff scream toward the start made my sides go to Venus
Such a great guy
Gambling with babish
That aint tears! thats oil.
Santa Babish can climb down my chimney anytime
No you're crying
Love the new videos
Awwwww babish. Seriously wtf is this guys first name?
“Sucky” oooooo the cringe
Can't wait to go to best friend in a couple weeks. I lost a dear friend this time last year, who was Korean. His mother was a hard woman, but she showed her love for him and his "brothers" with her amazing food.
I dont get this show... Babbish sneaks into your house at night, and scares you so bad in the morning that you piss your pants? On second thought I think I do get it
This was a very sad episode😢😢

Also imagine getting kicked out of an online college 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😭😭😭😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
"Best Friend"  is eye-cancer
😄 keep the good work on babish ! And we will continue to binge over it. 😁
this is so well edited,produced and structured!!!!! where's the mf oscar??¿¿
6:36 when you nut but she keeps zuckerberg
you better be putting sunscreen on that beautiful bald head Babish
Bro your an actual clone of your dad
Babish I can't keep watching this show if you're going to make me tear up every time, dammit.
Good job Binbin.
Your not crying I am
Is it just me or is all that yellow in the best friend restaurant kinda off putting?
The music doesn't help with getting teary eyed, please stop it, the concept is too heartwarming in itself, let alone the execution.
Wholesome.
Lmao is this an iguana?
Help me plz
How can anyone dislike this? They must have hearts of stone
sellout
This is full on enabling not helping anyone
ROFL 3 random obese ham planets wander into his apartment
Did Sookie and her sister actually eat their chicken? 'Cos their mum obviously only came for the food, Sookie was talking about her run of bad luck and her mum says nothing, just eats. I hope their luck changes and the YouTube is a success and their mum helps out and doesn't  just sit there, getting a free ride and free chicken.
Mental illness is so misunderstood and so often dismissed as a simple call for attention.  Kudos to you, Mr. Rea, for doing something so selfless for a family in need.
They have known health issues but they're still obese?
I love you Babish. Thank you for being the amazing person you are.
Dude you're killing it! Absolutely love this series
Or Blackjack with Babish! Big fan from India man...
This is a beautiful series and it's only the second episode
Oh. my. god. I want all of Roy's food. I also want you to do a show where you make super awesome elaborate things and have famous chefs just spit it out and chastise you.
You just need 3 more bald dudes and you coud make "Bald Eye"
Come to Lincoln, England please.
You are a good human. 🥰
Who? Who could dislike?
Any news or link to their Youtube channel?
Was that Masaharu Morimoto at the end?
1:30 -when i see my midterm grades...
“Sucky”
Babish's cookbooks should be on audible, with himself reading it.
2:20 is funny yet sad cuz he is bald
This thumbnail looks like Babish is bathing in a woman’s misery.
They are so fat and gross.
So you're "helping" people who make fucktarded decisions. Sounds more like enabling
Probably not the best idea to enable a dropout of an online degree program to follow a half baked idea about starting a you tube channel. Better uses of the money: tutoring, tuition, mental health care, assistance getting a real job.
Would someone plz tell that guy it's a Neko cat, not a "tiki cup".
Damnit... you did it again.  Pardon me while I go find a tissue.
I love this beautiful bald man
Thanks for making this downloadable Babish, saving this for the train ride when I go to work
You’re amazing ❤️❤️ I stan
Recipe for that chicken, sauce and asparagus please.
Wish there was a LOVE button!
If you in Vegas hmu
Binging with gangstash
I hope we get an update and that he tells us about their channel
This was uncomfy
4:08 Babish having a foodgasm.
Best human 2019
Babish you are srsly one of the most genuine and best yters out there
If you don’t like this video something is wrong with you
I really appreciate how unpretentious Andrew is about these things. It would be so easy to be very "holier-than-thou" while doing these things, but it's clear he really cares about these people and their stories, and isn't just doing it for the views.
Has anyone ever told you that your voice is similar to James Spader?  I never noticed it before, but when you said, “I’m pun deficient”, it REALLY clicked.
Shut up, you're crying.
Is it weird that I went to Vegas age 14? I didn’t gamble of course GUH why would you think that (mumble mumble)
ew fat
Nobody:
Babish at 1:31 : waluigi intensifies WHAAAAA!
love the new intro Babby, inspires me to go travel
omg im just trying to do my makeup without CRYING
Gaming with Babish
next
Andrew, come to Melbourne Australia and let me give something special to you for all the videos and all the meals you've given us all.
keep up the good work brother
As a food service worker, I'm just gonna hope the salamander joke was forced and my favorite YouTube "Chef" didn't really think it was called an iguana.
Who would win a three way match between you Sean Evans and Anthony Fantano?
It's really about family.
Am I the only one who wants more of Babish Snr? I love their family dynamic.
I thought it was Gambling with Babish
Run for president
♥️
Let us know her YouTube channel when she make one
Babish is that guy👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
plug their youtube channel!!
Is he gay? No offense just curious...
I thought this is a wholesome cooking show not a documentary about whales
I didn’t sub to a vlog channel wtf why not post this on a second channel
the one and only solution to all that families problems is not being fat, mental issues= cuz shes fat , health problems = cuz shes fat, but babish is being a total  savage and serving them extra food for the show lmao, they probebly visited mcdonalds for 2 hours before coming there
Y'all made me cry all through breakfast. True fan appreciation. Babbish congrats on doing something rare. 😚
Babish is Dr. Phil with the charisma of Anthony Bourdain.
Love the cooking but love these even more. Can we get a link to their channel/podcast once started please?
Whos better than us vinny
I may not be the first to watch this, I may not be the second, but I'm the 29,820'th person to watch this
I like this “Being with Babish” series 👍
Cool show man, nice to see you diversifying.
is it just me or babish looks like an alternate version of ryan reynolds
flexin' with Babish
Top 3 bald YouTubers. Thanks for the vids Babish
Awesome 👏🏻 
Congrats on 4mil too Andrew!
Went by so fast!
I thought his real name was Babish
Let's gamble someday mr.babbish
Was that teaser with Chef Morimoto? I'm so stoked right now!
I’m not crying chat your crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Is that a typo or is it supposed to say being?
I know you are American. But I hate this Emotional Porn that you all seem so fond off. Please don't make this a regular thing <3
Maybe try to find people a little more deserving? Who isn’t depressed in this modern world? That’s not a reason to shower someone with money and gifts. There are homeless people and orphans all over the world and you chose to help someone who’s lazy, not working, got kicked out of school and isn’t even taking care of themselves physically.
This made my day, such happy and quality content, Thank You Babish
Goddamnit Andrew how dare you make me feel my own emotions!
Truly skilled. Is it true you’re from upstate NY?
babish, if you end up going to san fran for this series, PLEASE collab with chef john while you’re there
Thanks for making videos
Another sweet episode!
i read this is gambling and giving birth in vegas
Okay just a bucketlist of that BWB Apron. Im not worthy to meet him..
Was that Lazlo in the backseat on your ride through the desert?  And Chef Morimoto feeding Babish wins the interwebz.
u da baddest
Like
Make more eps fast
Much love for this new series... living your best life man.
Babish, u da best
I bet Babish won't heart this comment
What is wrong with that mom? She had no reaction the whole time. I’m doubtful that she’s not the reason for the dysfunction in her family.
Please don't stop making these, they're so wholesome ❤️
One of the best shows on YouTube, period.
PLAY IT AGAIN
@ 
JOHNNY GUITAR
omg you're just like ellen....but bald
best show 2019 <3
This series is amazing! Keep them coming.
Still loving the Plates hat.
no homo but i'd let you binge my babish
I was planning on doing a restaurant shot at a table like the interview at the 6-minute mark. Is there any external lighting equipment used for this shot?
I love you
The world needs more people like Babish in it. . .
Whatever happens in Vegas stay in Vegas

Come on ! You're not just a great cook and film maker, you're a good man Babish !
Hey babish, so I have a request for u? One piece is my favorite show and I love cooking been watching your channel since the 4th video u ever uploaded, but anyway I was wondering if u could make the curry from one piece season 2 eps. 133 “a recipe handed down, Sanji the iron man of curry!” If u could that would be so awesome tbh idk if they give all the ingredients but if still love to see u take a crack at it. 
Thankyou, George.
Still with class and screaming f@#$. LMAO. Good man golf clap.
There is simply nothing more valuable than people who take the opportunity they have, and use it to help others. Thank you for all that you do. For teaching us all to be better people. And for making me hungry at least once a week. Much love.
Babish is the most wholesome youtuber known to mankind.
Babish is just an all around good human being. Love this new series.
IS THAT A VINNY FACE REVEAL
You are just the best.
1:00 Oh my I thought that was you Babish I had to rewind like 5 times because you looked a bit off
You are really a great person Babish.
Babish has to be the nicest celebrity out there
Sukki? You mean CYKKA BLYAT
Andrew, you have got  to come sometime to the Philippines. I'm a fan since I saw you on Buzzfeed and I would love to guess star on Being With Babish and suggest and try some of the food I suggested. Thnks
Damn I really wish I knew about this sooner. Would have loved to meet ya
Wow, Youtube deserves some good quality content like this
Yes, I'm crying. What of it! This was amazing!!! 🧡
This is great and all

Good stuff man!
Very entertaining and it's great to see you helping people.
You’re a good man bless you
Why do you always gotta make me cryyyy
This seems legitimately wholesome 😁👌
But's whats their youtube channel???
I'm sleep deprived and wasn't ready for these feels today. This whole community is wonderful <3
Wait he has a twin?
Lets support their channel!!
Love your watch!
AY VINCENZO!  2:12
Awesome 🤗♥️
Babish is like that guy that everyone stares at as he walks down the aisle
Who watches a video with so many positive vibes and gives it a thumbs down? Some people are trash
I'm loving Being with Babish heart warming and wonderful.
This is amazing, Babish. Much love from Iraq 🇮🇶
The most wholesome thing to come out of Vegas.
someone bait Ray to get a episode with Gordon Ramsay

inhales
FAAAAACK
Aye I live in vegas
Babish is such a real mans man,I'd turn gay for him
Can't wait for the kimchi recipe, make sure there are weights and measures!😊
This episode felt very different from the last one, but I assume it's because you are respecting people's privacy to their comfort level and that's great. Now. IS that Morimoto?!?!
HAS ANYONE SEEN JUSTIN Y
aggressively shakes
I’d love to hang out with Babish, even if it was only for a day.
Can’t wait to check out their YouTube. Please make a community post with the proper info when they make it happen.
You can get kicked out of an online school??
Anyone else notice that the cameraman is vinnie from Bon Appetite?
Absolutely love this new series you made.
2:19 Bruv Babish looking like one of them Mid East Sultans
This mans is amazing
Andrew, I don’t think it can be said enough, but you’ve got a heart of gold.
Bab we love you man!
New name of the series: Babishes big wholesome adventure
whew. i cried.
Episode 2 yeah
1:30 😂😂😂
I will keep cooking babish I will
Ohhhho I am early by accident.
Gosh I just can't apologize enough for the mix-up.
Babish, you were clearly mistaken. 

Those are delicious jelly-filled donuts
Y'all we just gonna ignore the whole "jazz cigarettes" line? New show confirmed: Bong Rips with Babish
You gotta be careful with those "jazz cigarettes."
Spinoff show: Baking with Babish but it's not about making cakes and bread
I‘ll use my trusty frying pan
When’s the first season of “Blazed with Babish” coming out?
“A couple Jazz cigarettes” lmao
Brock: "These Donuts are great! Jelly filled are my favorite. Nothing beats a Jelly Filled Donut."
me: casually watches bwb making a gourmet meal that looks so good 

also me: eats pizza rolls while waiting for dinner which is also pizza
Instructions unclear: made jelly filled doughnuts instead
You should make a “Froggy Apple crumple thumpkin” from Chowder
Please make butterscotch-cinnamon pie from undertale
It looks like you haven't watched Pokemon nor ate an onigiri. This is a jelly-filled donut not onigiri.
I always wanted to try Tohru's from Fruits Basket Onigiri
Is this the announcement of the new series - Blazing with Babish?

So jazzed.
Never understood why in Pokémon, they changed them to “jelly filled donuts”. Is America really that afraid of different cultural foods?
“Jazz cigarettes”


I hear ya brother
Still to this day idk how my mom makes a perfectly triangular onigiri
No vinegar in rice balls mate.
It’s just for sushi.
Put a bit of water and a pinch of salt, shape it and done.
"These donuts are great jelly filled are my favorite nothing beats a jelly filled donut"- Brock
Zoro, you lying moss head. You have been lying about your technique all this time?!
PERSONAL GOAL: bake and smoke jazz cigarettes with Babish 💕🙌🏾💨
Hey I know!
I'll use my trusty frying pan, as a DRYING PAN!
this donut are great ..
jelly filled are my favorite..
there's nothing beat a jelly filled donut
With yesterdays video this is How to make peace offerings to Both the Dub and Sub sides xD
Babish turned a frying pan into a drying pan!


It's not very effective...
You ought to make Mrs. Ketchum’s deep dish chili dog pizza pot pies!!
With extra pepperoni. Just how Ash likes it.
not sure if this was brought to your attention, but they make molds for onigiri
Are you blind? Those are jelly donuts!
These doughnuts are great
Jelly filled is my favorite
Thanks for showing me how to make jelly donuts!
Let’s just talk about how he pronounced it correctly
Normally you wouldn't use sushi seasoning for rice for onigiri. Typically you just put salt on your hands before forming them for seasoning. I have also found that if you're using a pressure cooker you really only need an equal volume of water to rice.

Pactice helps a lot, as Babish found. I have made ume onigiri several times, and I've gotten to the point where they're hard to distinguish from "conbini onigiri."
Oh wow, what's next? Big Smoke's order from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas?
I do not blame Brock.

How can he tell donuts and rice ball apart when his eyes are closed.
Those are some great looking jelly filled donuts. Man nothing beats a jelly filled donut
you don’t put vinegar in onigiri xx love from japan
This honestly seems like quite the simple recipe for the pickled plum ones, it also sounds quite tasty.
The omelette from "hundred foot journey" pleaaaase 😄
Babish smoked a little too much seaweed before making the snowmanigiri
Let’s all go to the lobby 
Let’s all go to the lobby
Let’s all got to the lobby...

And have ourselves some fun!

..Franku    😭
They are rice balls (onigiri) and Brock was just crazy calling them Jelly Filled donuts.
i really like you vids! 
but as someone who grew up eating my grandmothers onigiri in Japan, I have to say your biggest mistake is in the rice.
you do need an actual rice cooker, not a pressure cooker.


Cheers!
Jazz Cigarette is going into my vocabulary for sure lol
Had a couple jazz cigarettes and went off the rails. Lmao.
Lol gonna let you on in a little secret. A lot of us Japanese folk use molds to get that perfect onigiri shape these days. A lot easier than doing it by hand.
“Jazz cigarettes” you say? 


Babish you are the one, true hero of this generation.
I really want to see your version of sea-salt ice cream. (The one from Kingdom Hearts 2)
Tuna + mayo is really good too
Am Japanese
Make a recipe from the anime food wars pls
It would be great if you could do a “Good Burger” with Ed’s secret sauce!
English dubbed: Have some Donuts.
Yo dude you gotta try making Tonio's dishes from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure Diamond is Unbreakable!!!
A trick my mother used to use for these is using Saran Wrap when molding the onigiri
I'm glad you ratified this mistake.
I love you, never change.
"Jazz cigarettes"

I learned something today!
OH MY GOD THE ENDING IM CRYING
Wait... so it WASN’T a donut?
I just .... love your voice 😂..

Perhaps you can watch some onigiri video just to copy the technique..
You should make kelp juice from spongebob 🤷‍♂️
Do a Monster Hunter meal, or one of the newer Final Fantasy games...
Or Naruto...

Loving your stuff though, excellent!
"jazz cigarettes" lol
That's a vegan recipe! Yes
Do you plan on doing any more videos on Pokémon?
You literally say onigiri from 379 other shows. Mainly anime, but you get the deal
Hey Andrew love your videos! Looking forward to binging with babish book 2 with new recipes. Thanks for the inspiration.
These dinuts are great!
Jelly filled are my favorite!
Nothing beats a jelly filled donut!

-lost pause
You should try and cook the foods from JoJo bizarre adventure diamond unbreakable. Please
Back when Pokemon was good

Edit: also, onigiri donuts sound really good
Binge watching your videos again, thanks Babish. I'd lost my love for cooking lately, thanks to you you've brought it back, thanks again love
I would love to see you do a 'Backwards with Babish' show where you look at some historical recipes if you are at all interested.... :)
Can you make that meal from Mrs. Doubtfire? The gourmet meal he orders from Valenti’s?? Please!! :)
Oh so we are using the original version aye?

Love it
Your best video. Thank you for showing us ur imperfections
Will you ever try something from Czech cuisine ?
Hahaha!! Attempt 4 was preceded by a couple of "Jazz cigarettes"...   Classic!
Snowmanigiri?

Ohey, it's Glalie!
Good recipe, but the true magic is.... TURNING A FRYING PAN INTO A DRYING PAN!
You should do quesadilla a la Kevin and créme brûlée from The Office
Hey Andy

Just a question
 Is it important to season a stainless steel skillet?
Japanese: [Onigiri exists]

Americans: I'm about to end this man's whole career. 

[Jelly donuts entered the dub server]
Can you make a dish from the Anime "FOOD WARS" or "Shokugeki no Souma"
Jelly filled donuts are my favorite, thanks for making this!
🤣🤣😂🤣😂💡💡🤣😂🤣
Please do food from Steven Universe next! =] Fish stew pizza, cookie cats, together breakfast, gua-cola, etc!
"Jazz Cigarettes"

So that is how Babish can eat so much.
Make some spongebob meals like kelp fries and chum
The concoction from The Master!! I love your stuff man 🔥🔥
I wa thinking of Zoro’s Oni-Giri from one pierce, good video!
can you please do apple fritters double glazed from regular show
I really appreciate the "frying pan/drying pan" reference at the end! Thanks the the jelly donut tutorial!
Favorite filling of Onigiri is Tuna Mayo.
We always buy them at Seven Eleven
I need to say THIS IS HILARIOUS 😂 hahaha this unique onigiri is just his own style and there’a nothing wrong w it!
I came for the onigiri...I stayed for the snowman-igiri.
Hey Babish why don't you make the  cat safe food from my roommate is a cat, its episode 10..
I also wanna see what you would make
excuse me what did you say about jazz cigarettes
Tuna filling is the real onigiri

Seaweed and umeboshi are not nearly as popular or good.
Saw this in my feed before the name change 




Gib like now
DONT YOU MEAN
JELLY FILLED DONUTS
Edit: this is before watching the video
Hey BWB, I think that you should do Bobby June's Recipes From GTA V
That’s a strange way to spell Jelly Filled Doughnuts
I have a suggestion 
Mr Krabs Navy meal
I can't believe people actually thought onigiri were doughnuts?? eye—
These donuts are great!
Jelly-filled are my favorite.
wrong  way. vinegar, do not use to make onigiri. just rice ,salt , seeweed sheet(nori),
do not wash  konbu. just wipe it.
The April fools joke was great but I was not expecting to be blessed with your content twice
I’ve found that using plastic wrap to form onigiri makes the process a lot easier!
Pikachu sounds weird
PICAH PICAH
Do Lord of the rings food next pleaseee!💓💓💓
Great attempt, though I think you confused the sushi rice recipe with the rice usually used to make onigiri. For onigiri just a bit of salt is good enough because the filling already has a lot flavor :)
I think we need a basics on “munchies,” of course preceded by a couple of jazz cigarettes 😂
"Jelly Filled donuts are my favorite! Nothing beats a Jelly Filled donut!!!" -Brock
You should totally do each characters lunch from Breakfast Club
lol you did your best. triangle onigiri are hard. the last one i made turned into a sort of puppy shape... rice is not clay... got yelled at for playing with the food.
the frying pan drying pan reference was gold
This just makes me crave jelly filled donuts.
so my mans ash is called satoshi in japanese?


i learned today
gordon Ramsey joined the chat

snowman from rice
Can you make the master and commander galapogas island pudding? Also there are onigiri presses to shape onigiri if that helps.
Yay! He's making a Jelly Donut!
What? Onigiri? These are Brock's famous doughnuts.
What wonderful donuts onigiri! :3
Jimmy neutron amazing tasting candy

Can you make Ube roll from Steven Universe please?
Can you please try making Green Arrow's super spicy chilly
We usually use salt instead of vinegar sauce, but good video! Thank you for sharing our traditional food!
In Japanese traditional way, we never use rice wine vinegar for Onigiri🤣

Su-mesi(vinegar rice) is only for sushi including Maki-zushi or Chirashi-zushi.
Plain cooked rice is most important part of Onigiri...so...i confused.

Please do not misunderstand about vinegar part. You do not better to use vinegar for Onigiri.
(shape of Onigiri is no problem, cuz every person or family have their own way🍙)
Do coke-toast from Dragon Ball Z Abridged
You should consider making the "Trippa Snippa" from "The Big Lez Show" season 2 episode 2
Wow they made a detective pikachu cartoon spin off!
you might want to add a little sprinkle of you favored salt to the Onigiri right before eating. 
there is an excellent video from Japanology about that topic.
In Japan. We don’t season rice for onigiri by vinegar or so on. We cover onigiri by a pinch of salt. 
Nice contents anyway.
Damn. Going full Weeb with subbed Pokemon huh?
Watch a good amount of anime. And you will know what the foods actually are
I read "Onigiri" in Zoro's voice.
🤣😂🤣😂 you need that good cali jazzy 😭😭

Also me: complains that my onigiri is boring
i love onigiri, always make a couple with leftover rice.

Literally using the exact same scene, but in Japanese:

Make the kelp juice from Spongebob 😭 that would be gold
I hate to be that guy, but...


Ninja, dozo
Onigiri don't use sushi rice
I LOVE sushi rice but it's definitely not for onigiri
Onigiri is the name of a 3 sword style attack by Zoro from One Piece.
“Once you’ve managed to get yourself unstuck oH mY GoD GeTT iT oFf mE”

Your humor is the best part of your channel I love it
I remember I once made sushi rice without rinsing...it wasn't nice I tell you
Dammit, he played the wrong music, he should've played the instrumental to rice balls.
To make it easier to shape the onigiri use a plastic wrap. By using it the rice wont fall out😊
Man if you are going to venture to anime, there are many absurd cooking anime out there.

Maybe try something from Food Wars?

Or Cooking Master Boy for something oldschool
Oops thought I commented this already
Funniest thing in the whole video was “omg get it off me!
I liked karage and this one time I had one with a super specific mayo (sounds bad but god was it good)
my fav onigiri is the ones with tuna mayo filling 👍😋
Bug’s “Dream sandwich” from Stone Quackers. Donuts, coffee and blueberry pie filling among other things
We use plain rice for Onigiri. Add vinegar only for Sushi ^^
Video idea: Trevor's chili from GTA 5

Thank you for saving my brain cell
Make the marshmallow fish Casserole off family guy season 3 episode 22
These rice balls are great! Tuna filled are my favorite, Nothing beats tuna filled onigiri!
been binging on babish all day and your opinions on this one may be my favorite.
You should salt your hands when you form the rice ball
If anyone is having too much trouble doing the onigiri shape, there are molds that you can buy online (ebay, wish, amazon) that are super easy to use
You can also use plastic wrap, but it's not as fun and not very ecofriendly considering that you throw it away after.
I'm so gullible I believed him because I was like wait that's rice. Oh doughnuts? Ok I like doughnuts
can you make the good burger from... you know "The Good Burger", also don't forget the special sauce!!
98.12459% of people won’t see this but... 




This video was amazing 💕 
Love your channel! śú!b meeee
I went to Japan a last year and found Onigiri in every corner store and 7/11. They are offered in a variety of fillings and I ended up loving the one filled only with dried salmon. I must have eaten like 20 of those things in the span of a week.
But what if you combined the two, and made jelly-filled onigiri donuts
"jazz cigarette" I'll be sure to keep that one handy
I see you are using the term "Jazz Cigarette" a  century after it's coined. 
Very nice.
I like to season my onigiri rice with cut up umeboshi and then a blackened tilapia filling
Snow man onigri is my new favorite character on binging with babish
Somehow you have even made my favorite thing of all time look so hard to make why you bully me
I should use my frying pan
So my man knows about that Jazz Cabbage, excellent.
babby, how dare you use the sub version of the anime in the intro?
Can you make heavys sandvich from team fortress 2
The drying pan joke was my favorite thing growing up.
Make Ink Sphagetti from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure
Hey Babbish!! I'm a huge fan, been following all of season two. I think you're amazing at what you do, you always brighten my day with your cooking videos. I wanted to ask if you would consider doing a video on the DeathKwanDo Sandwich of Health! I think it would be hilarious lol. Keep smoking those "jazz cigarettes" 😎
This was a great video, I have watched the original Pokémon tons of times and now I can finally cook Brock’s I unbelievable food
Next: Banana sushi from Cromartie High School
Do Black Briar mead from Skyrim pls!!
Another great episode.

I will continue requesting any wacky food from Chowder.  That ridiculous show is a goldmine for you to flex your interpretive cooking.
I lived off onigiri over in Asia for a couple months. Loved stuffing it with tuna. So fucking good.
Pokémon is the only anime you should never watch in Japanese
I would love to see Skyrim recipes like sweet rolls!
I'm so happy this two-parter exists. I'll be making both for sure.
Since Reggie Fils-Aime(a.k.a. the president of Nintendo) is retiring on April 15th, make any of these Nintendo related foods:
Kirby: Squeak Squad- Strawberry Shortcake
Super Mario Odyssey- Stupendous Stew or Frost-Frosted Cake
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild- either Seared Steak, Fish and Mushroom Skewer, or Fried Egg and Rice
Pokemon Diamond/Pearl- Old Gateau
Can you do pork butts and taters from Cow and Chicken? Lol
Watching you make that first filling made me want seaweed salad. I'm gonna need you to teach me how to make that now.
Krusty Krab Pizza from spongebob next
You have gotta do some recipes from Food Wars!!
It looks really delicious!
Just so you know, traditionally onigiri use only salted rice, not sushi rice... I bet these are tasteful either way but... just FYI.
Awe. I wanted donuts again...
Babish, please do the foods from Red Dwarf!? Trout ala creme,vindaloo, tarla dall there is also that big banquet kryten makes for and a sandwich in one episode I think... please oh please do the foods from Red Dwarf! Sincerely

A huge fan :D
Thanks for the Japanese Pokemon clip.
I love making onigiri for picnic lunches. Sometimes I put teriyaki chicken in the middle or salmon
Thank you for the amazing April Fool’s joke, Babish!! 

May I suggest making a tuna melt for Wong from Avengers: Infinity War?
Juan’s kitchen collab? >///////<
What a coincidence, I JUST squeezed my plums.
You should teach us how to make bread bowls with homemade soups
Could you do the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show?
Nothing 🅱️eats a jelly-🅱️illed 🅱️onut.
This is absolutely not how you make onigiri.
🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙 found an emoji
So this must be the Japanese dub redubbed into English.
Love ya. Those onigiri still need work lol.
In this episode: onigiri with pickled plums and kelp and baked babish.
I love it - lol, it's great how people figure stuff out on their own and then find out they could've be have more wrong.
Lesson we all needed to learn repeatedly.
I love how you think those last one look like 'perfect' onigiri, still your channel though please try and do more international foods!! :D
Excuse me?? This is a jelly filled donut for your information
And that's why I bought an onigiri mold.
That is some really delicious jelly filled donut you got there
How about doing the soup Remy makes (or at least repairs) in Ratatouille?  I've always wondered what it actually was.
Please research Japanese food before posting. This is not how we make onigiri 🍙 マジで
What type of watch are you wearing?  Huge fan of the channel but also a watch fan! I've seen you wear some nice pieces.
Something has changed here but I don't know what. Whatever it is I like it. 

I'm very impressed with this April fools joke though. Really well conceived and exeggutor
ngl actual rice balls with jelly in the middle doesn't sound bad. pickled plum is just a different kind of preserved fruit
The snowmanigiri had me scream-laughing.
Tip for making triangular onigiri since you seemed to be having trouble. You form a triangle like you do in the video, but you toss and rotate a couple of times so that you have equal lengths each side ;)
Lol now I finally know what that wired looking emoji is.
no rice vinegar needed. just some moistened/damp hands with some salt and you are good to form the triangles. you may have had difficulty with the shaping due to the vinegared rice.
I love seeweed, it has a really good texture to me and the taste of it unseasoned and dry is amazing
You seriously have to make food from one piece
Do the Wedding Cake from One Piece!!!
It's one thing to have a last minute second attempt to show your willingness to get it totally right.
It's another to seem so temporarily broken by so many attempts you make a Snowmanigiri.
...That in itself deserves to be a Pokemon.  And that part was absolutely hysterical.
I came here for the donuts but instead got some kind of rice thing :/
isnt onigiri zoro's attack from one piece
I knew where he was going right when he slapped that rice ball on top of the other rice ball...
When you got 🍋, you make 🍹
When you got 🍚, you make 🍙
Can you make Pao de Queso? I dont care where you find it, just please make them!
Pro-tip: using Saran Wrap as a sort of hand condom when shaping the rice ball prevents ur hand from getting all sticky with rice
Nothing beats a good JELLY FILLED DONUT.
I love donuts! Jelly filled are my favorite!
My obachan taught me to salt my hands before forming the rice balls, adds flavor and keeps it form sticking.
I would love to see another recipe from the show Food Wars! 

I would request one of the challanging/technical recipes like the Rainbow Terrine.
I was waiting for that the whole episode, Thank you.
the onigiri still aren't perfect but good try and need to use more rice
Nah man, you gotta flip that pan... TURN WAYS.
Try making the "NACO" from Kim Possible
For this episode you should've made onigiri in the shape of a donut
Roronoa Zoro fans👇
You know what I mean.
"Just give your plums a little squeeze"
we dont make onigiri with sumeshi(vinegar rice). sumeshi is for sushi not for onigiri. they are different.
I thought he uploaded this for the anime's birthday

You can't do that on youtube Andrew!

Yes! Super excited to see this :) would love more foods from Pokemon!!
Vinegared rice isn't used for onigiri. You rub some salt in your wet hands, then form the balls.
I swear the title said “Onion Girl”

King of upset with this episode. I feel like you actually didn't do any research
That snowmanigiri caught me off guard.
Onigiri NEVER supposed to be seasoned like sushi rice!  You're only supposed to use salt.  This is very important!  Besides that though, it looks lovely.  Keep working on your shaping technique! ;-)
Can you pleasse do Le Walter Surprise. From the walking dead game, to commerating the end of the series!!!!
Youre supposed to use plain rice (no vinegar) and water with salt on your hands to mold them. The salt adds flavor and keeps it from sticking to your hands.
Mmm those jelly filled donuts look great

Jazz Cigarettes 💀
THESE JELLY FILLED DOUNTS ARE AMAZING AND NOT BEATS A JELLY FILLED DOUNTS!
Technically the rice for onigiri doesn't need to have rice vinegar. You just need rice and form (used salt water to moisten your hands to make the triangles and give some flavor)
Can you do Steele's eggs from the movie Juice ? 🍳🥓🍺
You should do ninja sex party's ultimate sandwich, I'd be pretty interesting, that's for sure

Only when he makes a recipe you know well you find out how much he butchers the dishes. No wonder those italians chefs got so mad at him. lol
Use plastic wrap to protect your hands while shaping onigiri. Similar to sushi chefs covering the bamboo shaper with plastic wrap.

More sanitary. Less messy.

I love watching the food making process, but I keep coming back for the hilarious voiceovers.
"Jazz cigarettes" best opening line to the snowmanigiri joke. Makes me wanna roll a cigarette up for myself lol.
Hey babish love the videos! Here are a few ideas for some future videos! Rabbit stew that Sam cooks in Lord of the Rings, Lembas bread from Lord of the Rings, the sandwich that Clark orders from Number 7 in benchwarmers, or a soufflé!

Why have I seen two of these Pokémon videos in the same damn day on the recommended list? The next user/re-uploader/channel I see this on is instantly blocked as I’ve tried the only other ways to keep these videos off of my recommended/suggested/curated/whatever it is.

Already unsubscribed as I selected “not interested” and “don’t show videos like this” on the recommended page... less than a day later? This same crap shows up at the top again. 

So selected “not interested/don’t show” and it comes up again...
So unsubscribed next to see if that will keep this from showing up...
The only thing left is to block the channel(s) that keep uploading it.
God bless this mans soul... not only did he make the donuts he made the Onigiri just to be safe too..💜

梅干しのたねを取るなんて、すごく手が込んでますね(*´▽｀*)
Do "snezzlewurst" from gumball!
Pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon covered in apple filling or any derivative of this
Babish! I really recommend buying a Japanese Earthen-ware pot for cooking rice, the instapot is glorious but the pressure messes up the rice too much. There's a science to cooking the rice that the instapot just doesn't do. Also, if it's too wet, try using a wooden bucket (hangiri) to dry out your rice
I think that the april fools ones were better
Brock’s jelly filled donuts
Onigiri uses the same kind of rice as sushi but is typically left plain after cooking.
With the Umeboshi try cracking the seeds. Inside is a much softer seed that is delicious.

Make coffee jelly from the disastrous life of saiki k
I agree with other posters, no vinegar-based sushi rice seasoning in onigiri, just salt on the surface. 
However, I do recommend rubbing sesane seed oil into your hands when you form the rice ball. It gives a dainty sesame flavour to the finished product while helping with the sticking problem. Works well with most onigiri toppings, too.
everything i know is a lie!

So regarding the kelp, would it be easier to cut it first and then reconstitute it, or is it too fragile in that sheet form which is why you did it the way you did?
Do spirited away! :)
I just wanna wish u both good luck, we're all counting on u.
Probably my favorite episode yet, partly because of my love of pokemon, and partly because of the term "jazz cigarettes"
Nobody adds vinegar to rice when we make onigiri. That is for sushi rice. That is why you couldn't shape them.
i would love to see Babish recreate a dish by Sanji from One Piece! i think they would be awesome :D

The white cake from django unchained, next?
I've tried both onigiri with just salt and onigiri with rice vinegar, I prefer onigiri with rice vinegar, which is most of the time homemade and can't be found in stores. The slightly tangy rice helps cut through the saltiness of some fillings (e.g. tuna mayo, okaka, konbu)! With umeboshi though, I think plain, slightly salted rice would be better because it is already quite sour.

So that's what this emoji is 🍙
there's some cute triangular plastic onigiri shapers you can find online, they help if you are looking to make the outsides look more like rice rather than porridge.
I'm not sure about the fillings. Tuna and mayo, chicken curry, beef and cheese, salmon, teriyaki pork, or kimchi would be more delicious and common fillings at least if comparing to Family Mart. Also salted water helps a lot.
Wow I've never heard Pokemon in Japanese before....
I wish this video had been out before I made onigiri for a random night with my friends a few years ago...  Everyone ate it but they were painfully bland and I got horribly sick.

When my mother used to make them for me, she would place the rice onto plastic wrap, stuff with salmon, and then shape the riceball using the plastic wrap to protect her hands. Less mess, and perfectly shaped each time. She would also wrap the entire riceball in nori, so it wouldn't fall apart near the end.
Thanks mom <3
Onigiri often have a larger seaweed sheet

Great video, 
I like the onigiri that are nearly completely covered in nori better, I like seaweed a lot :D 
Also: if you have several  different fillings you can put a  little on top of the onigiri 

Shoutout to the channel "Howtomakesushi" 
He has  several wonderful recipies 
But more importantly a video  on how to make sushi rice in several different ways (so if you have a ricecooker, normal pot with or without lid  its all cool, he has the answer and complete tutorial) a 
Plus a recipe for the rice  seasoning and  how to enhance  the toppings (eg marinating salmon roe)  
Definitively worth to check out and a great person and youtube creator :)     

Thanks Babish for including how your rice was off the first  attempts <3  
People  are always like "Wow I could never cook like that"  and i always try to tell them, that cooking is about trying new things and a row of trial and error without giving up 
(I for example still suck ass at making baisers till this day despite  several  attempts, not given up yet! :D ) 
Thanks for the great content <3

No one should be mad at you for messing this up... it's very simplistic to assume that a " kids' " show would have characters that only ate donuts... but not doing your research bit you butt, so it's all done now
Snowmanigiri is so cute actually xD 

Onigiri is kind of great because you can shove whatever you want in them as long it works with rice/can be served cold. We have ones with fried chicken and salted salmon at our school cafeterias.

So, I made a pork loin the other day that I swear tastes just like pepperoni!... But didn't measure anything. Figured I'd post what I did here and if you felt up to it you could play with the recipe. Who knows, you may find something cool to do with it!

Pork loin, roughly 5lbs, cleaned and thawed.
Into a bowl, thoroughly mix about 1/2c honey, splash of peperoncini juice, maybe a tablespoon each of balsamic vinegar, soy sauce and bacon grease (from smoked bacon), bout a TBS or two of paprika and garlic salt, five shakes of pepper, one shake each of allspice, clove, anise and ginger. 
Massage into meat. Make sure to slather all the nooks and crannies.
You can let it set, I did not.
Wrap in aluminum, with the fatty side up, and bake at 375-400 degrees until cooked all the way through. My oven is broken so I used a toaster oven... They are not precise...
Let rest while you make sides. I made mustard greens and grits.
----
One onion diced, one cup bacon, heat on medium until onions are just soft and bacon is cooked.
Add garlic salt and pepper to taste. 
Open one can of mustard greens, rinse with cold water, drain thoroughly.
Add to pot, stir, let cook until evenly hot and fragrant.
----
Add 3 and 1/2c water (or split it between water and milk) and half a stick of butter to a cold pan.
Bring to a boil, add garlic salt, pepper, and 1c dry grits.
Stir until it returns to a boil.
Turn on low and let simmer for 10minutes.

Slice pork thin, scoop out a healthy portion of grits/greens, spoon dripping on top, enjoy!
While you are on Pokémon can you make that sandwich that rolled down the hill in that one episode, I really want to know a) what was in the sandwich and b) does rolling a sandwich down a hill add any flavour
too many jazz cigarettes 😂😂😂
Those are some good looking jelly filled donuts.
I retract my pervious comment. No longer disappointed.
Lol should have made spice shrimp ones lol
if "Baked with Babish" doesnt happen I'll be thoroughly disappointed
I love your videos and how you edit them 🥰 very funny and can relate a lot too.
Mix the umeboshi with some bonito flakes and a little soy.  It's awesome.
PSA: make sure you watch to the end for an extra spicy meme
Make Patrick's  briefcase with donuts and a milkshake and etc from that baby clam episode from spongebob.
Nice!!
Hi, long time Pokemon fan. 

I’ve watched all the episodes of the original series. Played all the games. Collected most of the cards 

But it wasn’t until today, over two decades later, that I realized that the original series was actually in Japanese. And I never heard their original voices until I saw this video. 

I feel lost so I’m gonna go make these and binge on the original subbed version.
Jazz cigarettes😂
I do like the donut one a lot
Snowmanigiri!
Snowmanigiri was great ahah
so when are we getting a smoking with babish miniseries
I could’ve sworn this was onigiri. I just assumed the donut was another type after
Woah ive only just heard pikemon in japanese. Ruined it.
To be honest, as a japanese, we don't make like this way.
This is hella cute
You mean Jelly donuts?
Pokemon in Japanese sounds odd
Who else just thought of zoro?
Cooked salmon tastes better on the inside
I was confused by the outro until you said frying pan. then a stupid grin crossed my face.

I was right
Hey what's up Babish I am back to binging Binging with Babish and Basics with Babish
I came here for the drying pan
Ash's real name is Satoshi??
Oh wow... onigiri doesn't use sushi rice. It's plain white rice, which is necessary to make sure the rice complements the filling. It probably would have made that kelp filled one a lot better too.

Rolling and filling an onigiri is honestly quite simple. It's every step shown until you get to when the rice is done. I open the rice cooker so the rice can cool a bit and let it dry out a touch too. Then you fill a bowl with warm water and have a salt shaker handy. Wet your hands with the warm water and then shake some salt on your palms. Scoop out some rice (the amount will come with practice) and rolls it between your hands so it incorporates the rice and ends up in a ball. Then hold the ball in one hand and poke a hole in the center of the rice. Fill the hole with your filling and then spread the rice back over the hole opening. At this point you can shape the onigiri. I learned how to make the triangle shape from a scene in Fruits Basket.  It's easy but hard to describe.

My favorite fillings of all time are salted salmon and tuna. I've tried so many times to like umeboshi but it's just too much for me.
When he said umeboshi I had a flashback to the GMM most sour foods episode
SNOWMANIGIRI
Have you thought about lobster thermidor from Lego Batman?
When I do mine, I start with a ball of rice covered with salt and flatten it as much as possible. Then I place the filling on the centre and wrap the filling and form it back into a rice ball. Then I press it into the triangle shape. It's easier that way for me
JELLY FILLED DONUTS
Loving the comedic side (if that's a word, you know what I mean?) 😂👍❤️
Hmmm cheeseburgers
Regular kombu is very tough and we usually throw it away after extracting the flavor in a broth. There is a variety with thinner skin that is eaten and we make salads and pickles with them

Where the lost pause fans at?
I want a smoking with babish
Indeed, using vinegar in the rice is not authentic to Japanese cuisine, though I have made it the nontraditional way and enjoyed it. If you are going to try your hand at onigiri, perhaps go for the plain rice version first just to get a genuine impression.
おにぎり。うまいよね
Can you make something from American Psycho?

Binging with Babish is binging with alcohol....
Onigiri are NOT made with vinegared rice. That's only for sushi. Onigiri rice is seasoned only with salt, and maybe sometimes furikake. NEVER vinegar.
Lovin’ that watch

I made this once in my life with sweet corn and chunks of ham. It was beautiful
Why is no one talking about 1:29??!?!
hes like the bob ross of cooking
For the molding part, I am pretty sure that there are molds that you can buy to make Onigiri - this makes things way easier and less frustrating.
Lost pauseeeee
Please make Ms.Lovetts meat pies from Sweeney Todd! I’d love to see your babish twist on them!
Jelly field donut
Typically Onigiri rice use just salt for seasoning.  Sushi rice is a much more elaborate rice not often used.  

One easy way to make Onigiri if you don't want any rice to stick into your hand is to lay a plastic wrap on your hand and put the rice on the wrap.  Shape the Onigiri within the wrap and then unwrap at the end.  This way, you can avoid getting any of that rice stuck to your hands.
Babish should do something from food wars
🍙 I though this was cocaine
Make Tortas Ahogadas from Star vs. the Forces of Evil episode, "The Ponyhead Show"
omg this video made me so happy!! i'm half-Japanese and i grew up on eating onigiri and i actually got bullied in grade school for a while because my food was 'weird' so i'm happy to see that people are more open to trying Japanese food! also you did very good considering it was your first few tries! shaping onigiri is definitely a challenge and even though i've been making them for myself for over 15 years mine still don't come out looking half as nice as my mom's lol.


also for those of you who are interested in actually making these at home you don't have to add vinegar and sugar! traditional homemade onigiri is typically made with short grain rice seasoned with some salt (or you can use furikake, a Japanese rice seasoning, which is what my family likes to do) and adding a filling is also optional. the reason why many people add umeboshi in the middle of their onigiri is because it helps keep it fresh but i personally have always hated umeboshi lol so if you're like me don't worry because there are so many different types of fillings you can add to your onigiri. my personal favorite is tuna or salmon mixed with some mayo! onigiri is so delicious and easy to make once you get the hang of it so i highly recommend you give it a shot!
trying it right now :D

Before I even see the comments. 
I swear people are gon’ sayits jelly filled donuts.
Edit: I stand corrected. Nice vid.
Good grief what is the context at the end?
Many a funny brownie have me dying to see a Hook episode. Dying to know what some of that stuff on the Lost Boy’s spread was, and what foods Smede was so fond of as to shove in his pockets.
wow. those donuts look so tasty
Jelly filled donuts
I grew up in a Japanese household and we never put any vinagar in the rice to make onigiri.
Donuts lol
Practice doesn't make perfect or mean you will learn.  Attention to failure is what results in that.
I am addicted
You know while living in Japan, my neighbor made onigiri for me and not only would she wet her hands in water, she also dipped her fingers into salt before forming the balls.
Bro I don’t know about you, but I’m happy he messed up. I GET 2 MORE VIDEOS HELL YEAH MAN!

There are some weird recipe ideas in the first season of Digimon:
-Episode 7 - the kids discuss their favorite toppings on eggs including salsa, maple syrup, and jelly beans.
-Episode 8 - Peanut Butter and Pickle pizza
Also, a recurring joke is that Tai's mom makes even weirder things including beef jerky shakes, fungus cookie, and also a special cake in the movie.
Hahahah Jazz cigarettes 😂😂
Can you make Jessie's Pokepuffs that appeared in Pokemon XY episode, "Performing with Fiery Charm"?
I really appreciate that you show us the moments where you go "You know what I did this wrong and it took me this many goes to get it right" It can be so frustrating trying to get recipes right and it helps knowing that this is your damn job and you still need a few goes at things.
I can’t see the Pokémon at the start
I think you mean Jelly filled Donuts.

Is the sushi rice thing the April fools joke? Or was he serious???? Cuz if he was come on man you the food guy 😭
ATHF Broodwhich
If you cradle the rice in the space between your thumb and pointer finger it helps give it a pleasing shape. Using salted water for your hands gives an extra bit of flavor. Also, tuna with mayo and some soy sauce mixed in makes a very pleasing (and familiar) umami filling for us westerners.   😁
he is so sexy :D
🍘🍙
You shouldn't prepare sushi rice with metal tools. I think it was something with the metal reacting with the rice vinegar, affecting the taste.
I always wanted to know how to make donuts
Damn just realized we never had sanji in the kitchen
Thumbs up for jazz cigarettes
Pokemon in japanese is just wrong
We dont use sushi rice for onigiri lol we just use normal rice and then season the outside with some sea salt. Sushi rice with the vinegar is only used for, well, sushi
No its jelly filled donuts
On the subject of Pokemon, the berry bread from the 4th movie always looked delicious to me. I'd love to see an equivalent.

As a less serious suggestion, how about the rotisserie-style weed rats from Shrek? (Translating 'weed rat' into 'herbed meat' could work, cuz herbs are kinda weeds, getit.)
Please curry rice japanese please,its my favorite food japanese and onigiri.
HUEEEEHH?! BABISH SMOKE MARIWANA?! Jesus is gonna get you foe that
Cup your hands  to where your four fingers on your left hand are touching the base of your right pointer finger, left thumb resting at the bottom of your right palm, and close your right four fingers on the base of your left hand's pinky , your right thumb can float into the abyss for all we care....


- Flip the rice ball while doing this to make some smooth triangle! 
- Use a small piece of cellophane if you get sick of rinsing  your hands.
- Alternate the hands if you are a sinful left handed pleb~!
Great snack

I don’t want to be that person but as someone who has made onigiri once a week for my entire life this was rough. Maybe it would’ve been useful to do a collab with a Japanese you tuber? It’s not that you can’t cook this food, it would have been nice for you to show a traditional recipe with many tips on how to make this correctly. You did well for just starting out but I would never take your recipe seriously
Jazz cigarettes?
For beginners I reccomend using a plastic bag to mold it to a triangular shape. Im not great at it yet so i use this method instead.

🍙 🍙
That rice is WAAAAAAY too wet, even the last one! You shouldn't be patting and squishing the onigiri into shape, you should be tumbling it firmly in your hand to coax it into a triangle or square. And if the Konbu is too tough because you should be reconstituting it for AT LEAST an hour! Get some of the Dashi outta that shit and use it for some soup too! 
But otherwise, the thick sweet soy sauce for the Konbu is on-par and it looks delish.
Do not use an aluminum pan for mixing the vinegar into the rice. Vinegar will react with the aluminum, eventually causing holes in the pan and also tasting terrible. For safety, try using glass or porcelain containers.
OMG This is so awesome. Gotta love dem jelly-filled doughnuts
Ok thanks for explaining the aprils fools joke

Wait i thought you meant to make jelly filled donuts?
Its 2019 and an internet personality has LIED to me therefore by the rules of pretentiousness I am TRIGGERED!!!!!  😡🤬😡🤬☻🤬😡🤬😡
You can always get onigiri shamers!! They're relatively cheap and last a long time! I always use them when I make Onigiri, and it's common to use them!! :D
Hey guys, remember when Babish said he was going to make some Ghibli stuff soon?years ago?
Yeah you made sushi rice which is not used for onigiri, but sometimes Japanese people will use salt water when shaping.
Jelly filled donuts.
What about Onigiri filled with jelly? That's how I always imagined the rice balls from Pokemon.
A great tip I got for shaping onigiri is to use cling film instead of wetting your hands, since the water can make the rice too moist and not stick together properly. Its a great method if you're new to making onigiri.
No it’s a jelly donut
Donut
It is ok. You can blame the HORRIBLE dubbed for calling them doughnuts lol
Babish have you ever thought of making the ramen sasuke and ponyo eat from Ponyo? That or literally any other food from a Studio Ghibli movie would be god-like
It'd be awesome if you make more Japanese food! Some tips: you can add furikake to the rice to give it more taste. And my grandmother taught me to use plastic wrap to form the shapes - it's easier and doesn't stick to your hands :)
I seen this from my co worker and i really want to ask if i could try it 😂😂😂 it looks so good!
Without a doubt the best onigiri are sake onigiri aka salmon onigiri with a salmon/mayo filling.
Hmm I wonder if you can substitute that kelp filling with a sea weed salad mix?
How bout doing 24 hour chum fricassee from spongebob!
I love you so much Babish, and I would looove it if you made the soup and special order (sweat breads ala Gusteau) from Ratatouille. I know you don't usually repeat films, but there is a first time for everything.....
You could say the drying pan was not very affective.
They had onigiri at my college but it was just rice in a strip of nori.  It was good though, like eating a roll.
Yum, jelly filled donuts.
I think you mean jelly doughnuts?
You had me at jazz cigarettes.
Sub/dub!
I know this anime might not be too famous but can you do the recipes in "in this corner of the world"? It's a movie about a family's life during the war in japan, and they had a couple of recipes in there that seemed very interesting. thank you!
the mad lad actually did it
insert jelly donut joke
Nobody in Japan would call it onigiri if you use vinegar. Use salt.  VInegar is only for sushi, not for onigiri.
4:22 that's zen😌
Can you make the goofy goober sundae from the first sponge bob movie
Otaku!
Guys what is he talking about they are jelly donuts
Uhhh jelly doughnuts smh
I like you, thanks for being cool. I'm also drunk, but my point stands.
Onigiri is without sushisu すし酢 , just plain rice and fillings
Ok frying pan line gained him a new subscriber
You should make hunter's souffle from season 2 episode 8 of true blood! There's a whole bunch of food in the show, but that one sticks out in my mind
Snomanigiri is so cute though 😆🍙⛄
You have to make charred onigiri with shaved bonito flakes inside!
That moment when you can literally buy this is like any family mart
3:02 snaps fingers
I want those jelly filled doughnuts please
I clicked on this video because I saw rice balls and the word “onigiri” 
Wich immediately reminded me of zoro, from One Piece.
Your onigiri are so American.
That Brock joke at the end was great
Pretty good job

You mean brocks jelly filled donuts
Those are some weird ingredients for a donut, but you've never steered me wrong before :D
Nice, jelly donuts

Hahahaha I never saw onigiri as donuts. They have always looked like rice with sumo sash to me 😁
Babish, once again you have given us one hell of a show. I always love your videos. Thank you for doing what you do and helping inspire me to cook more! Something that I'd love to see you make is the fooda from Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away. I dont have a particular one in mind but I'd love to see your versions of the dishes!
I love that you used the Japanese audio.
You didn’t make this correctly.
mate you need better Clear Eyes. didn't work at the end there ;)
おにぎり大好きw
You don’t use sushi rice for onigiri. Wtf?  Just plain rice that is slightly salted.
I always wanted these
Trick for forming onigiri: cling wrap, place it in your hand, put rice on wrap, do the filling, cover with more rice, then use the wrap to mold your rice into whatever shape, it’s way easier, and no messy hands.
2:03 literally panicked when he asked that question... reminded me of those days way back in math class when the teacher would put me on the spot and I would have no clue what the answer is

These onigiri are great!  Umeboshi-filled are my favorite!  Nothing beats an umeboshi-filled onigiri.
I knew what onigiri was, but before realizing this was a joke, I was convinced that I was wrong and that this was true onigiri.
Great, now we created a new dish: donigiri.
But babish did you use your trusty frying pan as a drying pan?🤔
Thank you for this! I am a primary school Japanese teacher and I showed my grade 5/6 students this video and the screams of horror! One student went and hid behind a bookshelf they couldn’t stand to watch this. Fantastic video. ありがとうございました。

Thank you, Binging with Bad Bitch, very cool.
Im not a Weeb, 
But im watching this April 16th and i was almost triggered until i saw the description lol
I had a split second of fear thinking you were about to put jam in rice, which would of still been A+
He’s not just a chef but a bloody comedian

Looks at date


"Clever bastard."
Love how in depth you go with explanations. Great vids
xD Great April 1st video, also I just love how the show beats it into your head trying to convince you "THESE ARE DOUGHNUTS!"
the only joke is that Pokemon had to change Japanese food for white people
FYI for the outsiders: due to translation error (more like terrible dub requirement for foreign films) the dish in question was incorrectly named.
* Starts video *
* Realizes it's Monday and not a usual BWB release day *
* Realizes it's also April 1st *
* Watches entire video with extreme suspicion *
I'm still waiting for tossed salad and scrambled eggs.
I feel more frustrated by the fact it looks accurate than the joke
"that sort of almost seaweed like color" I lost it
Has Noble from Lost Pause seen this yet? THE MEME MUST LIVE ON!!!
"almost seaweed-like color"

10/10 best prank
I binge binging with babish more than any of the shows that he makes food from.
Wasn’t this actually switching else? Like it was changed to this because of stupid dubbing policies, Cough 4kids Cough.
Sigh they really doubled down on the jelly filled donut line didnt they
Krispy kreme:Were the best doughnuts in the world

Omg Japanese donuts are great ! Never heard of them.....
On trending. Nice job, great humour, and keep up the awesome work.
God bless you, you made something I'd eat on April Fools.
Beautiful, I love this kind of April fools effort. Wonderful work.
XD





It’s always exciting to master another culture’s cuisine, and I think I did thaaaa...Happy April Fool’s
a very accurate recreation of this beautiful and traditional japanese dish. i of course get all my knowledge of japanese cuisine from 4-kids dubbed shows.
I was like “how the hell does he not know what onigiri are?!?!” April fools “god damn it!”
You should have added another batch with your twist on it my friend... All in all that was an interesting recipe for Onigiri.
I was so confused until the April Fools reveal...
Almost all the youtubers I watch have April fooled me lol  I feel so wounded. Enjoyed the video, keep it up.
You could say this April Fools video was Brock solid
Omg Pokemon!!!! Do more please the first season recipes lol
your first time april fools-ing? you did great, no worries
Best usage of April Fool's hype that I have seen. Kind, funny, not on anyone's expense, and has a reasonable & silly background to it 😂
The original version was a rice ball I think. Rip 4Kids😂😂😂
At first I thought you’re gonna make actual onigiri filled with jelly but making it into real donuts is hella impressive.
Spicy 


Day:2 till someone says sweet
Sees english pokemon anime

Im pround of you little one
Just one question, did the doughnut join the clean plate club?

Probably, since it's a doughnut, but still.
I shall use my frying pan... AS A DRYING PAN!
This is not an April fools joke, This is PERFECTION.
It’s about time.
I need a recipe for these Onigiris
yoo this had me convinced all the way until the end good job babish great episode
Did you change the thumbnail?? I swear you used the thumbnail from the other video and it got me so good!
clearly holding a rice ball


"NOTHING BEATS A JELLY FILLED DONUT!"
Hahaha that totally scared me, I legit was worried these were supposed to be onigiri 😂
You honestly, honestly got me with this one. Great April Fools prank!
true connoisseurs would make Klingon Gagh from Star Trek!
I was getting more and more worried by the moment that you really believed it was donuts 😂 then u said April fool's
Now you just gotta turn that frying pan into a drying pan .
You got me mate iwas so angry at start my face was red 😂😂😂😂
DAMNITT!! you got me! ughhh!! i was so upset that u were so blind to that they are Rice balls, not doughnuts lolll ahhaha love you!
Talk about an April fools prank done right! I didn't realise this was fake till you uploaded the real one 😂
Marzipan?... 

Idk could be pronounced differently. In other areas. I thought it was like saying marcszipan..or like that
Finally, an april fools joke that's still serves function in my life after the joke part has worn off. This appeals to every practical sense I have. And my sweet tooth, honestly. Thank you!
Somebody send this to Noble Lost Pause ASAP!!! He's gonna love this 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
What if Japanese people didn’t know what donuts were and made it look like sushi?

Joking btw
Next April Fools, you should do the invisible food from Hook.
Chef Taako Tacco (The Adventure Zone podcast, TAZ, TAZ Balance) elder flower macarrons, 100 garlic cloves chicken, sole teather meat chili, and of coures tackos.
Watches video
Realizes it's April 1st

You cheeky bastard
Future Pokemon food idea! -> Team Rocket Honey Malasadas (Sun&Moon Series)
U made a confusion babish!
always remember... Brocks eyes are Always open
this is what happened when you are mistaken on dubbing an animu
Ah 4Kids. All these years later and we're still mocking your dubbing choices.
Do pickles in a cup from chowder
Can you make the soup from the start of the movie, and the special order from Ratatouille? (The special order is Sweet breads ala Gusteau, not the dish remy makes for ego)
Master another culture’s cuisine. You played it up so well. This channel is amazing.
This has to be the best April Fools' Day video I've seen this year!
This is probably the most cleverly-crafted dubbing error joke I've ever seen
congrats you're the only April Fools to have made me angry

Please actually do Brock's onigiri though! I haven't seen the original un-dubbed version of that episode but fingers crossed its pickled plum filled.
I was honestly like ‘wtf’ until I read a comment mentioning April fools.
Pokemon dubbed is different from subbed which is funny
😍 I love Pokemon, big thumbs up for you! 👍✨
I was full-on cultural PANIC MODE all the way up until the end! You are amazing. You done got me!
.
(Regardless, those look damn delicious and now I kinda want em.)
.
I'm also glad you have loyal followers that watch the ENTIRE VIDEO before commenting. Truly, good eggs with positive vibes. ❤❤❤
Man I really miss watching Pokémon :(
I will admit you got me. Happy April fools day.
you fooled me! i saw this but didnt "click" until the next day, at which point i read this title with the onigiri video lol
I’m using my frying pan... as a DRYING pan!
Oh man you got me pretty good with this one. Love your videos man, me and my girlfriend spend a lot of time watching them together.
Congratz BB, this was a good april's fools joke. So many emotions, yet it all ended in heartfelt laughter. ^^b
This felt wrong but I just went with it cause it was babish then he said "April fools" and I literally said "oooooh" out loud
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆

Oh, the good old days when 4Kids was being culturally insensitive.
Nobody:

Binging with Babish: I pulled on a sneaky on ya
I WAS SO MAD THIS ENTIRE VIDEO JFC.

I am a fool...
Noble is that you? XD
Got confused because I've watch the onigiri one and thought my YouTube is broken 😂
Can you actually make some fancy onigiri? I'm craving some
Japan : shows spinach

Murica : YEEHAW I SURE LOVE SOME GOOD OL BEEF
No That Not April Fools My Would That Binging With Babish
me: t-that looks like onigiri in the video

b: continues to make donuts

me: wait no am i wrong? was brock really eating a donut?

b: :)

me: my life is a lie

b: april fools

me: pfft i knew it was a joke ha ha.
What do you mean actual onigiri. Is this not real 🍙🤔
"And a little bit of food coloring. I'm going with green and black to get that almost seaweed-like color" I'm dead 😂
These doughnuts have curved edges, like no doughnut I've ever seen
When you're so ready to call him out but then you realize you've been trolled lol Well played Babish, well played👏🏾😂😂
You and the Nintendo Direct april fools video are the only two that got me...
Ah okay.  It's an april fools joke.   Damn internet april fools jokes staying around forever.
Can you make SpongeBob's Sundae😂
Babish used Tiny Whisk. It was super effective!
it may be an april fools joke but is still a great recipe if you wanna make onigiri shaped donuts
I thought you were gonna say “ let it rest for a well oiled hour” and then I realized I just watch you too much 💀💀💀
these look tasty though? like decorative onigiri
If someone sends this to Noble of Lost Pause for him to watch on a stream or a memes video, I will laugh so hard.
Please send this video to Noble!
Apparently whoever wrote the dub scripts has never ate a jelly filled donut
ahhh i see its april fools, thats why hes calling jam jelly
Tin man, he my man!
Smooth, tacky, sUPple ball of dough
But brock didn't make jelly donuts the dub just ....HEY WAIT A MINUTE !!!

Ive been had, Today is April first
Took me a little too long to realize it was an April fool's video
This is so painful to watch. Best April Fools ever!!
Nice joking around with that English dub. I love the dedication to the bit
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I was screaming at my computer I DIDN'T LOOK AT THE DATE
"..master another culture's dishhaaAAhappy April Fools."
WHAT IS THIS PRIVATE PYLE???
A jelly donut???
I think it would've been even better if you actually filled real onigiri with jelly. XD
As soon as I watched it like 2 minutes in I knew that you weren’t making real onigiri, and I saw that date in the description, but then I thought,”nah, this is too well made to be an April fools joke.”
"japanese donut called onigiri" 0:19 the moment you realized it's going to be an april fool video but continue watching anyway
April fools, I know, but the mad bastard actually did it.
You should make the mcGuffin from the amazing world of gumball lol 😂
I love this show they do foods I’ve wanted to see in real life for so long and you do the foods from some of my favorite shows
Oh wow,... he really had me grinding my teeth XD
Send this to Noble senpai xD...So he can make it himself
I love how even though its april fools day joke he still showed how to make a good donut
When are we sending this recipe to noble (lost pause)?
Monk fish turducken from malcolm in the middle plz
“Donuts are great, jelly filled are my favorite”
my half-southern heart jumped with joy when i saw the karo syrup @1:25
Lmao this dude did a whole meal on the local censorship of onigiri, love this channel. I want the invisible guns from yugioh next
I didn't realize it was April 1st and I don't often read Youtube comments anymore so this really had me going.
Jam filled onigiri (the real kind) are my favorite as well. Brock has the right idea.
I love how 1999 Japan knew the Western world just wasn't ready for rice balls yet so they called them donuts lol
"Happy April Fools"




Its already April?
I can only imagine how you will re-create the foods from Chowder. Hope that inspires you for a future video.
You made an illegitimately legitimate video that's entirely neutral while being genuine and self aware...(you blackout and awake at a nearby hospital)
You Know What Would Make This Better, Use Rice Flower!
Then we're going to punch a hole in the bottom using a paring knife and then squeeze inside
comma
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
That was one of the best April fools I've seen.
April fools joke or not I'd still make these
It's not often that a person makes an April fool's video and actually fulfills on what it's said.
I'd like a triangle donut please.
It's 1AM and here I am.
Ya got me up until you started frying.  Good joke.
Meanwhile, at the Dubbing anime company in america....
"Sir, those samurais are japanese, i'm preeety sure they're eating sushi"
"THEY'RE A COWBOYS EATING HAMBURGER IN THE HOLY LAND OF 'MURICA"
Noble needs to see this
The whole time i was like ????????? Onigiri is japanese doughnuts????? Whut???? You really got me there babs 😂
bro bro first off i love your channel. you awesome chief. but seriously. brock had a rock problem. one of those ingredients better not be rock.
Honestly, I've been thinking for years about making coconut covered jelly donuts to fulfill this joke. thank you so much for making this a reality XD
Kinda shocked and saddened that we couldn't get a 10 second demo on how to turn a Frying Pan into a Drying Pan..
"everything is a donut" - brock
Oh my god I didn’t even realize this was an April fools joke you’re a genius
One of the best April fools... Made me think babish is really dumb to the very end ;D well played
WOW you had me for the entire video. I was so excited for Pokémon food I didn’t even question it.
Noble would like to know your location
But, MARZIPAN?? Why not just use fondant?
Wait did babish say.... STAND mixer? AN ENEMY STAND?
0/10 no drying pan
You did it. Holy crap you actually did it.

We don't deserve someone like you, you're too good for this world.
Finally. Been waiting for this episode.
I was so confused until I remembered it was April fools
No one:






Babish: Kosher Salt
Finally. Thank you! These jelly doughnut look much better and unique shape.
A good bonus of this recipe is that if you're caught outside, you can use the frying pan as a drying pan
Thanks, but I like mine with whiskey XDDD
To add confusion I watched this on Tuesday thinking... um no?
Strawberry? I know my Bonne Maman, sir, and I believe that was a jar of raspberry at the beginning!

(Apologies if I missed something in the audio as my non-verbal son was quite loud whilei watched.)
Noble from Lost Pause disliked this video
"It's always really exciting to master another culture's cuisine" HAhahahahahha 
A+ April Fools joke
Brock and jelly filled donut
Name a better duo ill wait.
See, it wasn't a weird localisation, the japanese audio was wrong!
Thank you for bringing a good meme to life 😄
Brock's voice actor sounds like someone put a gun to his head
Quickly! Someone send this to Lost Pause!
Help...
Whats happening lol
This was a good April fool's day prank 😂
Are you crazy, Tsuna Mayo is the best.
the worst scene in any of the dubbed pokemon episodes, i love it so much, thanks for these amazing jelly-filled donuts, they're my favorite
watchs this after April Fools...
lol the description cracked me up. even got me with the expand for more too.
I actually thought it was just rice, seaweed and jam lol
Someone should probably sent this to Noble from Lost Pause
This is the best April Fools content on my feed and damn, I'd love some of those delicious jelly filled donuts
That was the FUNNIEST translation I've ever seen
You could have never mentioned April Fools and I would have been none-the-wiser lol
OMG you totally got me! i was screaming at the screen the whole time!
Man, I can't wait to try my hand at making onigiri
Japanese Dub: shows onigiri Here have some Umeboshi Onigiri
English Dub: shows onigiri Here have some jelly donuts
Japanese Dub: Am I a joke to you?
You joke but I’ve genuinely been looking for a recipe for onigiri shaped jelly donuts for years to have at my Pokémon Go community day meet ups
Nothing beats a Jelly-filled donut!!!
Gut busters from malcolm in the middle
Throughout the whole vid i was like wtf untill the end
WHERE IS THE DAMN ONIGIRI VID DUDE
You can just hear nobles screaming...
I love your stuff, you're always inspirational! I look forward to your future videos!
MAKE THE FRY TIPS FROM STEVEN UNIVERSE
I say this as someone who vehemently hates April Fool's Day...

Solid April Fool's Day video.
This was the perfect farce for April Fools day. 
Next year you should do food from xxxHolic, particularly the final episode of the first series which takes place on April first, the main protagonists birthday.
Bro. You actually got me.
I dont speak a lick of japanese so i was still confused after u said april fools
2:25 "doughnut craft" you mean DOUghnut?
BABISH YOU FOOL! THE STRIP IS FRUIT ROLL UP NOT MARZIPAN!
only 10 seconds in and i already despise your very existence, good recipe though based on the comments :D
Just two words
Lost Pause
Hah you got me. Those lookalike donuts looks hella nice though
3:36 Was anyone else bit got off guard and lit bit uncomfortable when he said happy April fools
Despite this being an April Fools Joke, I'm still very interested in making these at some point.
"Imma be honest they had us in the first half..."
Okay but are these donuts good? Like is the recipe legit? Cause they looked good...
Its cool seeing someone actually make an actual rice ball shaped donut, after seeing the rice ball video first.
I adore that you can so cleanly make a joke video still be informative. :D
I can't believe he made these abominations...


I want one
Definitely got me... I couldn't believe you had gotten something so wrong
Micheal it's tomorrow now, Onigiri please
R. Lee Ermey Voice: A JELLY DONUT?
He technically made how Brock said so, fair enough?
Jelly filled are my favorite
Nothing beats a JELLY FILLED DONUT
Marzipan?? Chowder episode confirmed?
I'm a simple man. When I see corn syrup in a recipe, I vomit.
Best tutorial ever. I truly feel like i understand Japanese donuts now, thanks Babish
Start doing anime foods. Those r super unrealistic and I want to see you challenge them
No frying pan used as a drying pan. I'm disappointed.
OMFG LOLOLOL YESSS I LOVE THIS SCENE
So zoro named his move (Onigiri) after a doughnut?
Best April fool's joke.......or not 👍
Impressive. Everything about this channel and these videos is super impressive.
Maybe a follow-up recipe of actual onigiri? 
edit: Oh!
This man actually made a recipe that seems good out of a stupid dub choice.
I actually believe you for like 3 seconds
Didn’t even know this was an April fools joke until April 2nd lmao
Hey babish, so I have a request for u? One piece is my favorite show and I love cooking been watching your channel since the 4th video u ever uploaded, but anyway I was wondering if u could make the curry from one piece season 2 eps. 133 “a recipe handed down, Sanji the iron man of curry!” If u could that would be so awesome tbh idk if they give all the ingredients but if still love to see u take a crack at it. 
Thankyou, George.
You see those Pokémon trainers from Japan? They've got curved donuts. Curved. Donuts.
It got me the april folls 😂😂😂
Rissoles from the castle, For your Australian fans!!
Haha! This is hilarious. But seriously though, those donuts look really good ^.^
I was so shook until i realized it’s April Fools Day 😂
He got me! I thought he was serious about Brock’s “doughnuts.”
Oh my god I cannot believe this
BABISH YOU ARE A GOD! I even remember that episode, the one with Mankey and Primape
OMG I'VE NEVER NOTICED HOW BAD THE DUBBING IS
It looks like Onigiri
It probably tastes like Onigiri
It definitely is Onigiri

"WoUlD yOu LiKe A dOnUT?" 

Wtf lmao
First thing I check: was it uploaded on April 1st...
OK fine I'm subscribed
Lost Pause wants to know your location
You already... you know what never
Props for leaning so far into the joke. Can't wait to see tomorrow.....which is today as I'm typing this.
To be honest, that's exactly how I always pictures the "donuts" Brock made.
1:30
Hmmm maybe it actually is seaweed
Somehow I watched the original first and then this... I was super confused ahahah
Judging by some of these comments, April Fools is the ultimate day of 'woooosh'.  


Next, do Pheonix Wright Hamburger's please, thanks :)
You know, you should send this video to a channel called lost pause
Send this to Lost Pause
I'm like I thought onigiri was rice
Sweet baby Jesus... That just looks surprisingly good... Never thought someone would made jelly filled donuts
I was watching this entire video thinking "that looks like rice, I would've assumed it was onigiri unless he said otherwise" april fools really got me, I forgot the date
Hmmm I should try this looks pretty delicious
See the thing is, these are also amazing looking donuts, so good looking in fact I almost want to make them more than the real onigiri
Babish is back. This is the content I'm subscribed for.
This is no April Fools Joke. This is amazing and I want to try making this.
this man actually made me triggered
N O H I N G B E A T S A J E L L Y - F I L L E D D O N U T
damn, you got me
I see how it is
I trusted you
Can you make the colored krabby patties?
I know this is a joke but my God for the longest time I really wanted a donut version of this and you've brought it ;-;
The only good dubs are the ones that get rid of annoying voices like “Serena” from Sailor Moon and Goku from Dragon Ball. Or maybe because those are some of the first animes I ever watched, before converting to Otakuism. 🤷🏻‍♀️
That confused me so much for a second there... XD
Lol, I watched the second video first, wish I saw this first I would have died laughing hahahahaha
LostPause want to  know your location
3 minutes and 37 seconds of "wait, really?" followed swiftly by a large amount of "ohhhhhhhhhh.....right....."





Second time I've been April fooled so far today
Even as an April Fool's joke, it looks delicious.  I thought it had a powdered sugar coating...
The fact you knew I was gonna read the description and bamboozled me so hard really upsets me Babish
Making us look down there in the description? That's funny. Good fooling for your first April fools-ing!
classiest april fools video on all of youtube.
Someone share this video with lost pause lol
for some reason i saw this after i saw the onigiri episode and i was very confused
I'll use my frying pan as a drying pan
That description though. Or should I say "dough". Muahahaha
Could you do:

Yoda’s snake stew from The Empire Strikes Back (For May the Fourth, perhaps?)

Turtle Soup from ye olde Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon

Barbossa’s feast from Pirates of the Caribbean
I'm not even disappointed tbh.
I might actually make this,  onigiri shaped donuts are actually pretty cool.
I don't understand what the April Fools joke is in this video...
These are the perfect donuts that can be enjoyed by 4K!ds
Me: oh dang! This whole time I thought those were rice balls!

- watches whole vid convinced my whole life is a lie -

Also me: ...oh...oooooh! Babby strikes again!
How about Beefy Burger from Mummies Alive TV series
Do luffy's meat pls
Instructions not clear i ended up making onigiri
Quick someone send this to Noble! XD
Of all the days to do this Episode.


It had to be this day.


10/10 would eat Jelly Filled Donuts again.
You see, this isn't an April Fools prank to me. I'm actually going to make this for my cousins to make our Pokémon conversation better
not gonna lie, you had me in the first half.... XD XD
Exfuckingcuse me even if it is April fools wtf
I got through the whole damn day without being duped. April 2nd began and I foolishly thought I could internet safely. Hats off to you.
If Babish was a pokemon, his special power would be to grind fresh black pepper
You know something's up when he calls what's obviously a jar of JAM a jar of jelly.
The best APRIL FOOLS JOKE EVER.
Now that, was Genius!
(Homer Simpson would like to know your location)
I thought you’d gone genuinely disabled before I saw the date
"Hey man I love pizza!" points at sushi..
Long live the tiny wisk
april fools! here are two videos as a joke...um, can we get more jokes?
As a kid I just stared at the "jelly-filled doughnut",trying to figure out if it's really a doughnut
i coughed when i saw that powdered sugar dust
I didn't click on this all day, because I was bothered that you didn't do research. 2 minutes in, my fiance was talking about how she couldn't believe the date and I felt foolish.
literally watched this yesterday and didn't realize it was an april fool's joke haha
The fact there is a stab at 4kids here is amazing
"All according to keikaku"   (Translator's note: Keikaku means plan)
IT'S A MISTRANSLA- oh you got me.
I for whatever reason never saw this when it uploaded, so I saw the real video first and was very confused after he said onigiri until I saw the upload date😂
Thanks! A part of my childhood stands complete.
Marzipan sounds like a prescription medication
"And there you have it. It's always really exciting to master another culture's cuisine and I think I did that he-ah happy April fools" 😂
Aww man this is my personality coming through! I am a dedicated viewer and thought it was for real :)
make the sandvich from tf2
I'm speechless at how good this prank is
I was pretty confused, until i remembered what day it was. lol
We need Japanese subtitles for this. See how Japanese people react to this. 😂🤣😂
Omg you got me so hard
Please make The Stinky Sandwich from Home Improvement!
April fools or no, I want these!
Oh man this is amazing. I remember that from when I was a kid and I was always confused as to why they were talking about donuts.
This is some deep anime-meta territory for a cooking show. Thank you 4Kids for this moment!
I actually was going to unsubscribe. I was so confused since your vids are always well researched. Ya totally got me
Umeboshi-fillings are my fav!!!♡ But I think I have eaten them with rice (i.e. onigiri) not in form of donuts. I seriously wanna taste it badly.😄😁😄
"I have an idea. I'll use my trusty frying pan, as a drying pan."
                       - Brock McSquinty
When Babish uses the same brand of food as you do

Oh good, so I’m not poisoning my food
MAKE MURIEL'S HAPPY PLUMS FROM "COURAGE, THE COWARDLY DOG" PLEASE
Next year's should be a tutorial on how to use the search engine.
Lmao the description
I like how you break everything down like a timeline
Yay! Americanization!
Now make an actual Onigiri and fill it with jelly.
... I want to see you struggle trying to eat it.
Wow he had me going till about the time he was rolling up his marzipan then I was like "wait a minute.. this has got to be an april fools joke"
At least you gave me something to do 🍙🍩
a legendary meme
You are a good person. This made me happy!
I was so confused when babish made donuts in the shape of rice balls/rolls (whatever the thing in the show was called). 
I was like,
"Wait! Was what Brock made in the show actually donuts? Was I the one who was wrong?!" 

But then he said today's April Fool's Day at the end of the video.
3:43 That better be rice being shaped into Onigiri.
Should've just left it at this and not done the onigiri video.
Hey Babish...... with just a little raspiness in your voice, I believe you'd sound exactly like Brock!
I was seriously confused. Not so proud of myself here.
I never understood why they thought it was easier to call them donuts instead of rice cakes, but I always thought they looked delicious.
Most of us were just clicbaited out of curiosity of what that emoji actually is..
Holy shite , i know this is just an april fools joke but damn that donuts look tasty
This is why I don't like dubs
The real joke is that Pokemon's English dub actually did this and thought nobody would notice.
Back as a kid I thought they were the weirdest looking donuts I'd ever seen....And I really wanted one!! Now I can!

Thanks babs xx
Welp, time to spam this at Noble
my mom lived in japan for 4 years and she almost cried when i showed her the intro
i like this, an April fools joke with something good to take from it
Someone needs to send this to Lost Pause! 😂
I hate that I love this.


EAT YOUR HAMBURGERS, APOLLO.
Calling onigiri a donut is the cringiest thing ive ever heard. Hats off man lmao
HI LOST PAUSE SCROLLING DOWN THE COMMENTS SECTION I SEE
I love you 😂❤
I was so confused, cause I didn't watch it on the actual date. Got me with that one! 😆
Good thing this recipe didnt need a frying pan, i was busy using it as a drying pan.
The English “dubbers?” Should’ve done research on what onigiri was before they aired it on tv.
Who actually cooks/ bakes these im pretty sure people like me only watch these just to watch them 😂
Oh my god 
You did not
YOU MOTHERFUCKER!


i've never been this "got" before in my life XD
Haha I remember actually requesting Brock’s jelly filled donuts to be shown over a year ago! I am so happy to see it was done!
Everything about this episode has upset me
Killing without lord Cavendish.
Don't even know what onigiri is so I just thought he was making some fancy donuts I DUNNO MAN
Will you ever do something from cowboy bebop? 



Also brock makes good stew
I was so confused throughout the entire video until the end.
OK but donuts that look like onigiri is still dope I'd make both versions
Oh ffs it's called jam.JAM
For April Fools Krispy Kreme pretended to do a chicken nugget dipping sauce based  off of their glaze.. Maybe you should attempt to recreate an edible version of it hahahha
Let's be honest, back then you really thought it was a jelly-filled donut. Even tho you're pretty low key skeptical that it doesn't look like one.
The best part of this joke is the description.
419 riceballs didn't get the joke
In Germany rice balls they called them popcorn balls and I was so confused as a chil xD
All the shade he's throwing thou 😂
i am watching this well after the 1st, so it didnt occur to me that it was a joke. I was getting to mad that he hadnt done any research, it is so unlike him! Lol, well played
THESE DONUTS... ARE MAKING ME THIRSTY
I think this went way over my head... 🤔

I remember watching that exact scene probably 20 years ago when pokemon first came to america as a saturday morning cartoon and being so confused at the localization... you’ve closed a glorious loop you mad genius
Nobles gonna have fun with this
This is acualy amazing
Triangle donuts are my favorite Japanese food..
Almost got me there! You should also make the "ice cream" from Pokemon aka omurice
Say what you will about 4kids, they did everything in their power to make sure Western kids would like Pokemon,
Hollow knight rancid egg when?
The real April Fools are the uncultured like me who believed this for more than a few seconds.
"Squeeze inside... Comma... a whole bunch of strawberry jelly"
I knew something was wrong when he didn’t tell me to liberally flour my work surface...
Can you make something from Malcom in the Middle? Either Lois' tart (S6E18) or Reese's monkfish turkey (S5E4)?
And we're here mocking 4 kids dubbing choices
Dang you made a dub change into a legitimate tasty treat, well played.
I dont get the April fools joke
Best April fools joke ever
If you're making Onigiri tomorrow, then the day after that, you should do real Japanese doughnuts!
Sata Andagi!~
Tin man he,my man
This is me showing my appreciation
Yooo at first I was like lmao wtf😂
Please make big smoke's order from GTA San Andreas, I have commented on all of your videos so far
oh man, you got me bad, i raged and screamed "DAMNIT BABISH" nice one lol
I still confused...I know what onigiri are...but why did Brock call them donuts then?
Please make Ichiraku's Ramen!
Remember. 4kids is still alive now under Konami as 4k Media.
Would love to see you tackle the fabled 99 cheese pizza from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Pleeeeeease do a Studio Ghibli episode man!!! There’s so many cool little things to make!!
Yes! I knew he was going to make these one day lmao!
You may think this is a joke, But I'm making these!
Noble would be mad... also amused haha
You had me until I read the comments and remembered the dates. Like "....this isnt right.....ohhhh"
Babish could you do Silver's Stew from Treasure Planet please?
omg. I was so triggered at the beginning.
Send this to Noble.
Can someone explain what he did for this april fools video.. im so confused
This is the best running gag ever
Do Chidi's Existential Crisis Chili!! It's getting close to Easter, itll be perfect!!
Binging with Babish and How to Basic collab please?
Honestly now I crave for these and will save the video for later
noble needs to see this
Whats all purpose flower? Light flower, hard flower, bread flower? What is that?
These Brock’s are great! Brock-filled are my favorite! Nothing beats a Brock-filled donut
This is the best. Not only did you slay with the jokes you got some great doughnuts out of said joke. And you taught me how to make marzipan and i am hype about that.
We’re going to shape it into rectangles to better cut it into triangles

I think you just triggered cell and made tien smile.
I'm both upset and overjoyed that youve done this
My brows were up the whole video 🤣🤣
“Squeeze inside COMMA a whole lot of strawberry jelly..” LMAO
today we learned about satire in english, just saying
Is it bad every time I hear him say ‘knead’ I keep hearing ‘yeet’
Lol Turn your pans into drying pans please lol 😆
Instructions unclear make actual onigiri instead
Bamboozled by Babish
I knew the reference as soon as I saw the title and I though ‘this is going to be funny’
You've earned yourself a subscriber for this
Ha jokes on you, these look pretty good actually
All pranks aside, those donuts look really good.
Beautiful video and narration Andrew! Missed the old soundtrack
Did you use flour or powdered sugar on your board when rolling out the dough?
"Its always really exciting to master another culture's cuisine!" God damn it, Babish that made me laugh too hard.
Diabetigri
Give me Bell Peppers with beef, but without beef (Cowboy Bebop)
I want talk mr babish is onigiri or donuts i don t known but its same,please give your question thank you.
This pizza is good! (Eating noodles)
Now you should make "Drying pans"!
Quite unlike any donut I've ever seen 🍙🍘
I was about to say, babish must have a death wish cause he's fixing to get an army of weebs after him.
Monk fish turducken from malcolm in the middle plz
468 people apparently didn't get the joke.
You sneaky little beautifull man, you got me, i saw the whole video with an raised eyebrow. Good one! Congrats
April Fools hahah🤣🤣🤣🤣
im actually kind of hype for the real onigiri episode
April fools prank aside, how we’re the donuts?  I can’t be the only one wondering
After watching both of these, I gotta go with the jelly filled donut!
A perfect amount of time. That's what this video was. It fit my poop time perfectly.
next year we gotta have some steamed hams from the simpsons
I would love to see a video on the Kahuna Burger from Pulp Fiction! And of course a tasty beverage to wash it down
Boy, these look like good sandwiches.
“Onigiri” is actually rice ball 
And the black thing is seaweed



Sike!!! April fool is a thing
Was going to comment that I'd love to see an episode where you actually make onigiri but then i saw that you're actually making onigiri next episode!! Can't wait!
mmmm if only I could eat Babish's Onigiri doughnuts lol... that looks good... minus the coconuts... allergies man :(
Cuz WTF, Fox Kids? XD
Ok, so onigiri  is great, but I would eat those donuts.
You are brilliant!
Can you please make the Best Burger In NY from HIMYM
You should do the dessert dog from the simpsons
😂😂😂😂😂
I saw this and instantly just kinda smiled a little and thought "booo. XD lol "
One for me this is coming out April 2nd. And secondly next time use sugar instead of coconut
20??: "I get those are rice balls but, you gotta admit, that would be a pretty cool donut design"
2019: this video.



EDIT: whoosh, scored some pretty good likes here.
.... but those are riceballs.... ooooohhhh i see what ya did there lmao I forgot what today was
Okay this was really good I'm glad he knew the pokemon eng jpn differances
But did they really taste good?🍩=🍙
They're not donuts! Somebody already pointed this out? 🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙 Not donuts! 🤬👹👺🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🤖👾🙅‍♀️🙅‍♂️( April fool?)
Make the gooseberry pie from Snow White and the 7 Dwarves
I am so confused about the joke 😐
Why is this man making French croissants.
I thought nobody cared this makes me feel better
Chocolate pie recipe from the help with the special ingredient
Even knowing this was an april fool's day joke, I was still confused as to what in the world he was doing
I legit want to make these myself.
I was so excited for this :(
Store bought jam? Im not mad... just... disappointed
Yes he's trending my boi
Watching your video warmed my heart, at least there is someone who knows how to do an April fools joke the right way.
one thing i hate about dubbed content, the fact they changed onigiri to donuts in the anime
While this is a joke, it's still a great donut recipe and technique video... Might have to make these for some Japanese friends of mine lol
Cough cough jam cough cough
I KNEW THIS WAS A JOKE :D
Not gonna lie though....those are the rice balls I'd love to have
Lmao I was very confused
But was it clean plate club worthy?
I'm curious
Rather than coconuts if you cover the fired dough in rice instead would it still be good? 
Cuz I know deserts made out of rice actually is a thing.
ok but this actually would be delicious so jokes on you
Wait a second... is this a April fools prank? Dont ask me how I know, I jus have a feeling it is
This man is dedicated to his cultures
I never understood why they couldn't call them rice balls in the show.

You actually kind is just made a  fairly proper sopapilla too.
just realized the video is 4:01 long and the level of detail babish puts in his videos is mind blowing
Your pizza cutter is amazing
(sees video)
Me:ok, he should know what is a onigiri 
(sees date)
Me: 3 weeks later, god damn YouTube notification
IS THIS AN APRIL FOOLS JOKE TO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE IN ANYMORE
Ha! This always confused me as a kid.
Must share with lost pause
These would actually be great to bring to a party as a joke tbh
damn you April!
I'm honestly so confused
I knew it was a lil suspicious that you posted today....

Great video Babby, they actually look really good!
did you just use the same cartoon excerpt that you used for the onigiri video but in japanese?
Watching this on April 2nd so that prank hit me twice as hard 😂😂
YOU ABSOLUTE MADMAN
thats not onigiri
Thank goodness it was April fools. I thought you were going crazy 😂
"Squeeze inside comma a whole bunch of strawberry jelly". Nice
I didn't even realize this was a prank, it just seemed like a regular episode
You should have used a darker green
Still a delicious concept regardless!
I will not die peacfully until you make the katsudon from Yuri!!! On Ice.
damn it you got me lol
These donuts are great! Jelly Filled are my favorite! Nothing beats a jelly filled donut!
what if they weren't donuts all this time😳 I just thought it was a change in dialogue in an attempt to americanize the series so Americans would go pokecrazy🤪🤣  either way these were some kick ass donuts please keep teasing our palates  😜
I was so damn confused as a kid by the 'donuts'!
Hey BWB, make Daffy's Powdered Sugar Breakfast from The Looney Tunes Show episode, "The Stud, The Nerd, and The Average Joe"

Also you have to put the casserole dish in an oven since it won't fit in a microwave
Great episode Babish 😂😂😂
while this might have been a prank, I am definitely tempted to make this XD
They didn't even change the animation to make them a box of doughnuts.
THIS IS WHY ENGLISH SUBTITLED ANIME IS BETTER THAN DUBBED
Everytime I see the tiny whisk, I know it's gonna be lit🔥🔥🔥
I know its a joke, but those look insanely delicious.
This angers me but I know that he did this as a prank
I love this idea lmao
Really clever idea for an April Fools video.
You are using jam
Was gonna comment about it being rice and seaweed until I realized what day it is...
Says to roll dough to eighth inch thickness. Clearly rolls to almost half inch....
You should do an episode on 'Potatoes and Molasses' from Over the Garden Wall.
At least we have a recipe for onigiri themed doughnuts
I can’t express the relief I felt when you said April Fools. Lol. I honestly couldn’t tell through the whole video if you were being serious or just hiding the sarcasm really well. And I didn’t realize it was posted today. I was so concerned.
Can you actually show us how to make the real thing?
April fools
Adams family crab crossiants
The entire video I was WTF? dude onigiri is rice! When it got to the coconut part I was banging my head into a wall. You got me, you got me really good.
Whats funny is I just saw the Onigiri episode first just now (didn't see this up yesterday) and the moment I read the Title I thought to myself "They're Donuts!" lol
This is the best frikin meme video
Y'know what? These donuts have a novelty to them that makes me actually want to make them. It seems like something you would legit find at a Japanese bakery
Someone send this to lost pause
Ha Ha But we still got an episode outta it Babish so jokes on you 😂. And I was thinking that the so called "donuts" in the show were rice I was so confused.
Someone send this to lost pause
Still beats those round donuts we have.
Make the 7 layer salad from how I met your mother
As a joke, he can play scenes of Zoro yelling onigiri.
how much fresh yeast for one pack of yeast?
in the thumbnail i thought it was rice
Now do the magically vertically bouncing hero sandwich from that other episode. :p
This is his first video I've seen and I fell for it!
I wonder how many people believed this performance, probably the fans who never looked into the dubbing mistakes made during the early years of Poekmon.
I found this to be very creative.
I was fooled... I was about to say how you'd was wrong.
1st April is basically the day you tubers decide to be absurd
Omg you absolute baffoon
This may be a April Fools joke, but I don't watch Basics so I actually like this recipe
I'll just use my trusty frying pan... as a drying pan
I wasn’t smart enough for that joke.
He still made damn good looking donuts
I know you're just joking but it was painful to watch this one.
Wow, marzipan really resembles seaweed huh🤔
Trending in the 🇵🇭
I forgot this month was April
this made my pp turn into a question mark
Pleaseeeee do the lunches from the breakfast club!! It would be so cool if you did them normally and then like a gourmet version!
Ah, yes, the exoticly oriental jelly-filled triangular donuts.
lol and it wold be alsome if you did ca comparison with actual onigery and yes i know i bucherd my spelling.
Best episode to date 😂😂😂
What is that watch? The face is beautiful!
Babish,  this is perfection and you should pat yourself on the back for making me laugh way too hard,  cheers mate!
Literally the best April's fool
Noble should see this lols
lol that was awesome
Best April Fools video ever. It’s a joke AND it’s useful.
wow and my prank was just switching the frosted flakes with corn flakes...
LOL you got me
I knew something was a little... off when he got to the recipe:


Andrew - Makes dough
Me - "But Onigiri are rice balls..."
10 seconds later
Me "...What day is it today?"
i was getting kinda confused like wasnt he eating rice balls
I loved that ending
Tbh I fell for it
To be honest, when I was a child in the 1990's, when I saw that moment from the anime, I believe that that was a donut in the Pokemon world. This is the same world with a fire-breathing dragon(even though it's not naturally a Dragon type) and a rodent that can discharge electricity. It wouldn't have surprised me if that was what donuts looked like in the Pokemon world.
It wasn't until either high school or college that I learned that they're actually onigiri. If the people behind the English Dub had just called them rice balls, I would've been okay with that.
dang my dude your hands are shaking 3:37
How about you try cooking the jelly patty from sponge bob
YUMMY 😋 now I want doughnuts 🍩 jelly ones rule
UNYIELDING RAGE
Ok, cool, but also make real onigiri bc I can't afford to go to Japan
EDIT: I WILL BE BACK TOMORROW SO EXCITED
can you make mendl's cakes from the grand Budapest hotel?
You were supposed to use the frying pan as a drying pan.
...is it wrong that, when I was a kid, I actually thought Brock and Dorothy from Yugioh GX just made dessert 🍙?
Hoho, you got me there 😁
10/10 best April fool's day joke on YouTube.
brock what the hell did you make
ONIGIRI has left the chat
watching this after the serious version of this vid is absolutely hilarious
4Kids always messing with kids minds. When i saw this as a kid I was so confused.
ok i saw the other onigiri video first. i was like how come he havent done donut joke or temp to make a donut first the i saw this one and it make sense now
Hahaha I was confused but totally got me. Even thought isnt "onigiri" a sushi dish and I've never heard of a Japanese donut like that. Apart from the marzipan, sounds delicious. I blame it on the fact I watched this on April 2nd 🤔😳😂
I love you tiny whisk
I hope LostPause reacts to this.
Make "portion" bread from the force awakens
XD oh I get it 
It took me a few XD
Thanks for giving these delicious Jelly Filled Doughnuts proper representation in the American food market
Actually, those are sushi. You know nothing Jon Snow!
If I wasn't already subscribed to you, this would be the video that'd do it. I saw the title and IMMEDIATELY burst out into laughter and  gained a ridiculous amount of respect for your levels of nerdness. And your follow-through? Perfection. Actually the best April Fools joke I've seen all day.
I always thought they were rice balls (onigiri) with jelly in them
April fool or not, thx to the “happy accident” that dub mistranslated, and the internet turned into a meme, and now 2019, people even attempting to recreate it (one from Lost Pause -Noble) and I’d say I’m gladly to try that confection if you actually sell it at any bakery store
When you make an April Fools joke video but it’s your best recent video and actually “true” to the source material again.
I did the captions yaaaay
I always thought the green part was brown and they were chocolate donuts with desiccated coconut.
Babish: "It's always really exciting to master another culture's cuisine..." 
Me: BABISH....... it's now or never; you better say "April Fools" LOL
Brock aka Gordon Ramsey of Pokémon
2:22 did you blowtorch a donut?!
SOMEBODY SEND THIS TO NOBLE
I don’t watch Pokémon and these looked really good so I’m good lol
You know i actually thought he was going to actually wrapped jelly in rice instead of an actual donut.
Next: make "popcorn balls" and "sandwiches" that kind of look like onigiri.
please actually make onigiri this just hurt my sole that episode hurt my sole because he called them donuts
Have Lost Pause seen this yet?
Uh... Nice one. you got me?
Seen Pokémon and came running, who’s with me?
These actually sound very tasty!
God dammit 4kidz
Ur a goddamn legend.
Happy April Fools
So many people commenting like they are experts in Japanese culture. And BTW, it's the 2nd of April! (as a little over half an hour ago!)
Everything beats a jelly donut...
you got me... i have to admit
If no one has yet tweeted at Noble (Lost Pause) about this, someone should. He is gonna loose his sh*t when he sees even Babish got in on trolling him this April 1st, lol!
Instructions werent clear: made onigiri instead
I always thought it was so silly how rice balls were translated to jelly filled donuts
Well done. LOL
This is hilarious! 😂 tbh tho they kinda do look like snowballs 🙃
One of the most blatant mistranslations ever.

Why couldn't they say something like stuffed rice balls? "Because the kids wouldn't understand that those are."
Wait they look like rice balls
The description tho
catching up on april fools videos.
🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙
Nothing beats a jelly filled donut
I was very confused for a bit
nobody can master the donuts. only brock.
Well played good sir well played
Gotta eat them all
🍙good ol traditional donuts🍙
Not gonna lie, despite the fact that this is a joke, that still looks really good. Then again, how could you go wrong with a doughnut?
I can recite that line my heart bc noble says it so much😂😂😂
I dreamed that this would exist one day.
Ight but can we get an actual episode of this, Japanese donuts seem cool

Edit:nvm i watched the outro
Babish just lol-calized the crap out of that jelly-filled donut!
april fools day is like a minefield on youtube, carefully avoiding the horribly obvious ones only to step on a gem like this
Screw the rules I have donuts
Not gonna lie he had us in the first half
could you make Sojiro's Curry from Persona 5?
so having been to japan there was a village that i visited that used rice and seaweed, believe it or not. the jelly filling was jelly but had more of a lemon square consistency.
@LostPause
Bleh, marzipan.
I just got the joke and I watched the video last night
"Traditional..."
I nearly forgot what day it is, but this reminded me instantly.
Mankey later punches the so called jelly donut and it crumbles as if made of rice!
Could you do Sojiro's Leblanc Curry and Coffee from Persona 5! Also Crab Rangoon from Far Cry 4, Rocky Mountain Oysters from Far Cry 5, The Southern Dinner from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (pork chops, mac and cheese, collard greens and sweet potato pie) and The Cake from Murder on the Orient Express would also work! Love your show man, been watching it since the beginning!
Still looked DAMN tasty.
Is it sad that, after watching nearly every episode of this show, that I was 100% ready to believe that? I was sitting here thinking "Well, he obviously knows whats going on so... Neat. Guess I just imagined stuff being made out of rice as a kid." Babish challenged my childhood and won lol.
Its just rice and seaweed at the bottom
Make the broodwich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
HE DID IT!!!! THE SUNOVAB**CH DID IT!!!
You gotta make hamburgers from the Phoenix Wright video games for next year.
Could you make Ichiraku ramen from Naruto
3:52... How long it took me to get it... Perfect. Just perfect.
the madlad
You madlad.
Lost my shit at the thumbnail, thanks Babish. Good content as always.  Looking forward to seeing your real onigiri.
i was honestly wondering what was happening in this  then realised the date
Babi does it again 😂
i demand more tiny whisk
You got me!
DO THE "MEAT PIES" FROM SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET
Well played, sir. Well played.

HE DID IT LITERALLY! RICE BALL DONUTS!
Brock.... Thats not a jelly donut

Yo this was funny as hell
Please make Semla from One Piece
I can't believe America messed up that dubbing so bad
Please make Winchester surprise from Supernatural
Okonomiyaki please!
Jelly Donut... shows jar of jam
Why hasn't there been more memes about that scene? But now I am craving both of those, thanks...
When I had suggested this idea I didn’t expect you to make actual donuts and this is much better than I ever expected and a great snack to bring to the next anime convention!
Why does this remind me of a meme.
That looks good
This is kinda trippy as earlier today that terrible dubbing choice entered my head out of nowhere, and now here it is
Hey, you should make Ayumis pizza sauce from the anime Charlotte.

Edit: Make the omelete rice to.
I'm ashamed at how long it took me to realize this was an april fools day joke. However, I'm going to make me some jelly filled donuts sometime in the future now.
Yes you do. Good joke ya punk
Make pretty patties from spongebob square pants
Anything from Food Wars.
Holy Jesus....
What is that?
As Brock also said water types are weak against fire types
Congratulations on 4 mil
Make the “Bread makes you fat” Garlic bread from Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World!
I grew up in a town packed with Japanese immigrants and therefore ankle-deep in onigiri.  They were woven into our lives, even the gas stations had them. It baffled young me to no end why the kept calling them donuts on that show.
Do food from One piece!!! You remind me of Sanji anyways!!!!
1:14 dissapointed you didn't demand it set for one well oiled hour
April fools huh wow
Can you do Agent K’s pie order from Men in Black 3? Like so he can see.
Whats a better localization:

Filthy acts committed as a reasonable price

Or 

Jelly Donuts
I rewatched the intro like 5 different times. Blame the 🌲
Good ol babby!
localization for pokemon was soooooo "on point" back then applaud 4kids tv lol to them bad dubs
Today's date: 04/01 (American calendar). Duration listed on Thumbnail: 04:01.
Coincidence? I think NOT!
Please do food from How I Met Your Mother!! Like Erickson’s 7-Layer Salad, the Minnesota Tidal Wave aka the Robin Scherbatsky, and Sumbitches!!!!!
I will never understand why they couldn't just call them rice balls. This is an awesome troll though.
SOMEONE SEND THIS TO LOST PAUSE!!!
w...what (looks at date) oh
In the movie Armegedon there is a scene during the preflight physical where one of the characters described how to make haggis. I CHALLENGE YOU TO MAKE AND EAT THAT HAGGIS!
I’m so confused, can someone explain how this is a joke?
This is perfect for people who only watched the dub and didn't know what Brock was holding
Mmm Beef donuts are my favourite!
You got me, Babish, you got me.
Please Make the 7 layer Salad from How I Met Your Mother!!!
Apparently the western world wasn't ready for rice balls JELLY FILLED DONUT
🤤🤤🤤
A little upset you didn’t make the jelly
God damnit, i thought i was safe since It's April 2nd here... I was not safe.
Watches video and due to lack of legible knowledge of what day it is thinks its a Tuesday
Goes to school waiting for class to start with this new found knowledge that it's Tuesday because of Babish upload
Go home after realizing its a Monday and unsubscribe from Babish
Next you have to turn a frying pan into a drying pan
How do you use a drying pan?
Nice joke! I didn't know they were called 'donuts' in the English dub until I saw this. And I like the "you can do whatever you want to do with your life" part.
I know that this is a joke but god it triggered me that he was making actual donuts and not onigiri
Love Localisation joke, I feel bad for those who don't know what real "onigiri" is 😂 nevertheless this looks good, can't wait to tune in tommarrow for the real recipe. ❤️
THESE DOUGHNUTS ARE GREAT
Description made me smile
Well played
@LostPause
All your problems have been fixed.
Bless You.
Whew! I was watching this, frankly worried that you were confused. And that would be embarrassing.
this is magical
Is this recipe real and safe to eat though?
Make the clogger burger from the Simpsons movie
Whoa taking me back to my childhood!! You're the best dude!
Great video Babish! Cant wait for tomorrows!
thanks I love it
Lost Pause sent me.

NOTHING BEATS A JELLY FILLED DONUT
Anyone here after the real vid
🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯🥯
I am so shook this is not ok
If we can't eat coconut, would powdered sugar or white chocolate be a good replacement?
He should've turned the frying pan into a drying pan.
Mmm... Donut's
Why is this my favorite of your videos?
you scared me there for a second
I like how he narrates the mistakes
I bought one of these in Japan, but they scammed me. Was just rice on the inside.
I feel bad for the people that started making this before they watched the whole video.
I love you
How about dark matter from gintama ?
Dub is something else
I live in London and so when I first heard the jelly part and initially saw your vid I thought it was going to be "jello" filled.
Please make the ramen from naruto! Thank youuuuuu
UMMMMM ACKSHUALLY!
Guess I’m an idiot and don’t get the April fools joke
I made these were OK tbh
Love the vid. But why was the dub saying donuts. Was it just a mistake. Are there censorship issues. Or is onigiri the work of the devil.
Squeeze inside a whole lot of jelly That sentence is too perfect.
What?  Are you ment.....   Son of a....!
Your evil
Haha got me there!
I legit dreamed about this last night that somebody would make a april fools on this.
I dont even care that this is a joke. I absolutely adore Pokemon and this episode of Babish made my day!
Someones been watching pokemon
He should make malasadas from sun and moon
I feel like this would still taste hella good tho.
Lol oh... I'm viet and thought those were like... Japanese version of banh bao


Then again it's been like 20 years since I've watched pokemon, so I never saw the episode of Brock saying Jelly blablalbla


Has Brock ever opened his eyes yet?
omg, I could not stop laughing lol.
Just watched this, and didn't realize that this was put out on the first.
Seems legit
Lmao I was bout to say wtf ???!!?!!?!!&!
Nothing beats a jelly-filled donut.
Oh NOW I get it
And the way I see it ladies.. you owe me for one jelly doughnut!
He got me, I didn’t realize the date and was getting so mad at him but it’s cool now
Isn't jelly filled donuts a mistranslation
You joke but it's actually incredibly satisfying seeing white triangular donuts after all these years
Babish what is the background music to this, can you post it on its own or direct me to a link!
i👍🍩
This is sin
30 points to Babish!
Lmao this is so good😂😂
I really appreciate your effort to make a onigiri-resembling donut. Very impressive🍙🤤
These are a prank, but they taste really good
Doughnuts ? I almost get mad lol
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE YOUTUBER LOST PAUSE!
Make Bubble Buddy's Krabby Patty from Spongebob episode, "Bubble Buddy":

Wheat Buns with no crust(If it's possible to remove crust from a bun in real life)
Pickles on the left side
4 squrts of ketchup under the patty
Farm fresh tomatoes
Non deli lettuce
Carnival style(use carnival merchendise)
I love how I want to eat the joke dish almost as much as the real version. And we learned a few new tricks in this one. Barely seems like a joke. Which is great.
Nobo help
Noble tried to make one... @.@
At least you still taught us how to cook something.
I forgot today was April fools and I was super confused as to whether it was a joke or not
Sorry to say it Babbish but onigiri is actually a type of rice ball
Someone @lost pause
Christ almighty.
🤣
So we're gonna punch a hole, and then squeeze inside, a whole bunch of jelly!
Defenatly donuts
Way to commit. Also vichyssoise from Batman.
Why did the dub version change it...
This episode sponsored by 4Kids Entertainment
Please make Mooncakes!
Jam doughnuts are better than jelly doughnuts, yes there's a difference
Im upset.
i think it was “mochi” or “moechi” a chinese dessert idk
AMazing! Honestly, the amount of work and dedication you gave to this joke is phenomenal!
Making out with Marzipan is totally awesome!
“These donuts are great!”
4kids Approved!
but its  4/2 how tf
Ha! What a creative April fool's day video. Well done my man! Can't wait to see real onigiri tomorrow :)
“Doughnut”
Food war anime plz
i don't get it
I like shots!  They're comfy and easy to wear!
But will you use your frying pan as a drying pan?
It's weird to think that yeast is living......
Wheres Noble he needs to see this
I don't get it. Can someone enlighten me?  Thanks.

Make Forrest Delight from OK K.O.: Let's Be Heroes episode, The Perfect Meal
I love you
Brock is like Pvt. Pyle.
“Noble has left the chat”
Chihiro's parent's meal that turned them into pigs in spirited away please
I had to look in the comments to figure out why this was an April Fools joke.  Just seemed like some oddly shaped donuts to me.  Were they good though?
Iconic
I don’t get the joke?
It’s a rice ball..not an actual donut..
I think you would be great at recreating a dish from Shokugeki no Soma: Food Wars
It’s actually rice balls they had to collect donuts in the dub A.k.a. English version
0:06
I hate how dubs change  the original word that were said in subs...
Knew straight away cozz seen the episode
I was waiting for you to say you made jelly in your drying pan.
J e l l y f i l l e d d o n u t s
Is that the actual english dub
Even though this is a joke, those look delicious asf
So...meme food or not...was it good?
I was dying laughing through the whole video. Great idea for April fool's. 👍
Food Network hates him...
Idk if I’m actually supposed to use a small whisk but since this could easily go wrong for me.....here goes nothing
Someone please save my brain cell
Those are not jelly donuts.
You used the wrong ingredients.

I am very disappointed.
You should know better.

The marzipan should be fondant.
Those are riceballs
Banish:Marzipan 

Me:Mazapán?
"brock.....it's....it's a rice ball.....it's onigiri"
"MAN!!! EATING DOUGHNUT IN OPEN NATURE SURE IS GREAT ASH"
"no......it's a rice, it's white and sticky and scattered all over my hand, there's sour plum pickle inside of it,  what do you mean it's a dough...."
"IT'S A JELLY......FUCKING.....DOUGHNUT!!!!!!!!!!"
Can you make himym foods pleaaase. Eg. the best burger in ny, or stinsons hangover fixer elixir
Noble
So this is actually a thing I may try... Leaving off the coconut cause gross.
Should’ve done the entire thing in Japanese for the second one..
You absolute mad man, you actually did it
I’m dead.
GET LOST PAUSE
...but how does it taste?
Lmao
Everyone: pewdiepie takes a meme too far.

Babish: Hold my beer.
😂😂😂
Bingeing.
They couldn’t of just said rice ball?
We're they good?
LOST PAUSE!!!!!!






Nothing Beast a Jelly-Filled Donut
Lost pause must see this he would  love it
Make spongebob's krusty dog and his dishes in the episode where he gets fired from the krusty krab
I wish 4Kids should stop dubbing anime shows. And that the actors could be in better anime with free creative control.
I just got the joke lol funny guy
Man I remember being a kid and seeing this for the first time and when I looked at the thing I wasmore confused when they said it was a jelly donut.  I knew donuts, that was no donut I'd ever heard of,  about an hour later though I Was like...that thing looked more like a ..ball of rice with some black strip around it.   Gotta love Funimation >.<
The donut thing isn't because of bad localization but because the people making the dub thought that kids wouldn't know what onigiri is
🍙🍘
I remember watching that episode as a kid and I was really confused on why Brock called it a jelly donut.
God bless America. We've got the best Jelly Doughnuts.
🍙 its called a rice ball it was never a jelly donut
you sure
Mmm dubnuts
Did it taste good though
I’ve been fooled way to many times today 😂
I’m on vacation in Japan right now and it’s so weird to see all these April Fools videos here on April 2nd lol
THIS IS TRUELY WHAT WE WANT TO SEE
Oh yeah
Did you check the expiration date on that ,,black” coloring
Nothing beats a JELLY FILLED DONUT.
Lols. I watched this going *no its just one of them triangles with the salmon /crab you can buy at the 7-11s"
I choked when I read that
This is cultural appropriation and it's horrific.
The wrong, cursed way to make onigiri.
tbqh this looks rather good
Eat your burgers, Apollo
Must resist urge to tweet @lostpause
OMG this clear false translation always bothered me. Like why does the english version need to pretend that they're donuts, I could've learned about Japanese cuisine even sooner in life.
very well done
69k likes ;)
Loool it’s so nice to master another cultures cuisine lol i was like ooooomfg babish what have you done
green strip was.. seaweed... they were tuna rolls... <_<
Oh my gosh this is amazing
can we get Robbie Rotten's blue cake?
Like who hasn’t watched that scene
amazing
Stop using plastic, bro. Use beeswax wrap, I know damn well you can afford it .
Who thought Brock used rice as the donut
Ends the video "April fool's". R/madlad
ok imma be honest, always thought these were sushi... they look like sushi do they not...
damnit
Please pick literally ANY recipe from Chowder. They're all wild as hell, and the names are extremely close to the real thing. There's literally a character named Marzipan.
ド、ドーナツ？？？
Make Tortas Ahogadas from Star vs. the Forces of Evil episode, "The Ponyhead Show"
HE'S DONE IT.
I dont think thats donuts.
Babby show us how to make jelly
Do his lazy boy no chew stew from the first movie! (it gives no ingredients or anything, I just wanted to type that out)
I was actually considering making this for a second and then I realized the date at the same time he pretty much said you wasted 4 minuets if your life
They looked really good... But if I'm not wrong onigiris are little rice balls and the black strip that they have in the bottom is dried seaweed >:3
We all knew Brock was smoking an oddish
Congrats dude, you got me. Happy April fools
i was about to cancel this channel when i realised lol. sorry bb, im not going anywhere
I'm confused
Nicely done...got me triggered from start to finish and juuust as I was beginning to formulate my post of disgust showing the world my displeasal with your ignorance you declared me a fool for revealing twas all a joke...well played, sir...well played (please excuse my writing. english is not my first langu...langue...speech-thingi) 😅😁🧐
This is a joke right? Like, we all know it was a bad translation?
Damn... That was a good one. You had me, all the way to the end. I was hanging on. Inner monolog: *surely...SURELY HE KNOWS.... * end of video: (Audible) Haaaa!
Still liked the idea.
I seriously could not tell this was a joke
Man I am hungry now.....
Omg please do more Pokemon food 😍 poffins and poke puffs in particular
I am always on guard on April fools, so this is the only April Fools video in YouTube EVER to confuse me yet.
Good Job!
Booo they sre not donuts...
Well they still look good
🍙
you absolute mad lad
first few seconds: b-but isnt that an onigiri (rice ball) ???

in the middle of the video: oh wait. april fools, right? rIGHT??

end: holy shit man u got me
OMG that's so funny!
I don't get it
I don't get it
I love u
Please attempt foods from Spirited Away!
Jam*
Poor Noble if he ever finds this
still hate 4kids but that joke is on point
That watch is mesmerising, which one is it?
Still gonna make these...
Delicious
Lost Pause has left the chat
Couldn't straight face the whole video huh?
In Germany, you call these jelly-filled Donuts "Krapfen" or "Kreppel". But delicious as always :-) Keep on!
I know this is a joke but I'm disgusted all the same
I would eat a dozen of them and none of the real thing
This came out on my birthday. Hurray 😊😅🍙🍙🍙🍙🍩🍩. Love from Australia 🐨.
I don't think it was called jelly fuled donuts it's called rice cakes
yeah, end some to Noble-Senpai, as his channel states


"These donuts are great, Jelly filled are my favorite, nothing beat's a Jelly Filled Donut"(all filled with cringe and pain)
DONUTS IM SO SORRY THIS IS SO FUNNY
Even as a kid something just looked off when I saw the episode for the first time.  I didn't know what was a rice ball at the time though.
I’m confused, I know this was a joke but did the episode actually say donuts or did someone voice it over????
If nothing else you’ve taught everyone how to make marzipan.
Is this just Babish trolling us? He knows thats just seaweed and rice right?🍙🍙🍙🙄☺ April fools!
Ah yes... Brocks famous "donuts". This is why i hate the people who translate...
The era of bad dubs.... those were dark days
This is an April fool's joke I can get behind
thank you, i was about to comment how onigiri isnt a donut but a rice ball
unsubscribed

he didnt use his frying pan as a DRYING pan
April fools and everything but what's that gorgeous watch you're rocking Andrew??
I don't get it
I want that.
Lol I’d always be so confused  when brock called them jelly donuts
Nooooo lmaooo
Good grief, I remember being so confused when I first saw this. I knew what rice balls were at that point (my sister and I watched Fruits Basket) and remember thinking to myself "PLEASE tell me Brock didn't put jelly in a rice ball..."
Hello
Would still eat.
I didnt need my colon anyways
I'll still eat it.
Lol 😂
What
4-KIDS thought we were mature enough for dog fighting, but not enough for onigiri.

Death? Yes. 
Rice? No. 

That's localization at its finest.
Whoa it’s me
NO, IT TOOK MY DONUT
Have you ever done the imaginary food from Hook with Robin Williams? No food will ever look as tasty as that food in my childhood memories. Cream pies, meats, etc
But were these donuts any good?  And can you do the Arroz con Pollo from the Documentary Now! episode "Juan Likes Rice and Chicken?"
Could you make Granny Cream's Hot Butter Ice Cream from Hypnospace Outlaw?
It's very tasty and healthy, too.
The only April fool's joke that actually got me today. WELL PLAYED
When he said them donuts i was like " I hope he knows the dub was donuts because of American bull" then I hear April fools then I'm like thank god
Dont mind me...Im just trying to find maybe Noble left a comment
The best part of this is the " oo woops " that occurred in the subtitles when he almost dropped the marzipan.
Once he started making donuts I remembered wut day it was
I’ll use my trusty frying pan... as a drying pan!
Make chum fricasee from spongebob.
Lost Pause, where are you???
I would have died if you filmed yourself making onigiri but dubbed it over with your recipe for doughnuts.
Am I the only one who didn’t get until he finally said “April fools?”
Who else realized through this video that Zoro’s attack is named after a jelly filled donut?
Brock cooks his donuts in a drying pan so your missing out on that smokey, wet flavor!
Boy do I love Jelly Donuts!
This is such a nuanced joke
Honestly i have been watching you for a while and you have helped me get through some tough times. You have inspired me a lot. You even inspired me to come out and start my own channel . Thanks for all the positivity. God bless you!
The cover image screamed Onigiri but the title said doughnuts and just, I didn't know Babish was part of the April fool's community

Also am I the only one noticing he keeps hinting at time management???
Cool👍
It would have been great for a april fools video if He just went all how to basic in the end ...


Well there is always next time
I hate you so much but love you at the same time
This is so amazing lol!! Great job!!! They look delicious regardless, well played hahaha.
You know at first I thought you just didn't do your research and were confused until you said seaweed green marzipan and I realized it was April fools.
Can you make real onigiri now that April fools is over?
Tonio's dishes from jojo bizzare adventure
I knew what Onigiri was when watching but I was confused but didn't think of it cause I was intrigued
I'm more happy about him tricking us and then actually giving us the recipe tomorrow.
Haha it’s April fools because they’re not doughnuts lol
That was 10/10 censorship on pokemon
Brock: Pulls out rice ball nOtHiNg bEaTs A JElly fIllEd dOnUT
Somebody send to lost pause
Man nothing beat japanese jelly filled doughnuts
Aprils fools on me. Was just going to write a comment about what is an onigiri.
Please do a poké puff next
You got me there.
go! donut!
I don't get this what's the prank?
You really had me there !
THESE DONUTS ARE GREAT
Babish, baby, you got me!
It's interesting how shows change the dialogue to appeal to a different audience. I remember when I saw that episode back in the day like...what kind of donut is that? lol.
Oh wow. This was the only April fool's joke that got me today! The entire time watching this all I could think was, "He does know that's wrong...right?" 😂😅
omfg did he reverse his background music too? hilarious and genius.
MA-ZA-PAN, No marzapan chingado XD
This is the most delicious looking April Fool's joke I've ever seen.
noble will be madddd
I always thought the joke in the show was they were legit rice balls with nori and jam xD That in itself is an april fools joke xD
Ladies and gents, the Nostalgia train has arrived.
can you do a naruto themed video?
Someone send this to LostPause!
As soon as he didn't make his own jelly, I knew something was up
I went the whole damn day, and Babish ruins my sucker-free day.  Well done sir.  I actually started to think I was wrong about okimura being rice based
make the malasada now
...but that actually looks likes it works...and I would eat it!!! But I like all your videos!
I believe onigiri  is made from rice. Like sushi but in a different shape.
April FoOls hahahahahaha
Ugh.  Never got into pokemon.
As who isn't very familiar with japanese culture or this pokemon meme I had seen onigiri before but never eaten them. And babish is just so trustworthy, he's like the Youtube Tom Hanks. I was thinking it didn't sound like a very Japanese recipe, like shouldn't there be rice flour in there or something? You had me until the very last second. Well done.
...And here I thought Blizzard announcing Diablo Immortal for Smart phones to be a good April Fool's joke.
I didn't know I could love this channel anymore than I did then you straight up did the "jelly donut" from Pokemon! 😂 I'm done! Great vid!
For a second there I forgot it was April fools and I was about to go ham for Babish slandering my culture
You had me going the whole video about Japanese onigiri. Even though I know they are rice balls. I thought it was just a take on them, or maybe a regional thing?! Lol!
Im wondering if what noble thinks about this one😂
Aye brother make some lemon caper chicken. I'm having a lovely lady come over Saturday and want a babish approved recipe
My favorite part about the localization is this, calling them jelly donuts and thinking no one would notice that rice =/= donut.
Anime food always looks so damn delicious, great video Babish, can't wait to see the new Being episode!!
Someone show this to Lost Pause lmfao
please do the spell cake from brave!
suggestion: the food from avatar the last aribender and legend of korra.
That marzipan reminds me of the homemade play dough that my grandma made for me lmao
Yeah while watching this video I was like wait aren’t onigiri’s made of rice????? And then came up the April fools thing and I was like oooooooh
This is great
Can somebody tell me if they actually called onigiri, a jelly filled donut or is it just an April fools prank.
I always watched Pokemon in japanese so I don't know the dubbed version
Btw I'm Japanese so don't try to call me a weeb
The funniest part is that the entire time I was confused since I already knew what ongiri were and that, in Pokémon it was an English translation to donuts so that American viewers would understand better the weird triangle shape.
They're not even doughnuts.
mmm jelly donuts
Yeah I completely forgot the date there and thought you'd lost the plot.
Finally! A Pokemon video of Binging with Babish!
LOL Happy April Fools!  I was getting so frustrated with the mislabeling of these, lol.
Pronounce the Z in Marzipan like you would for pizza :)
I cringed when Bab said it felt good to master another culture’s cuisine only to then be bamboozled with an April Fool’s. Well played, sir.
The fact you almost made this plausible for 4Kids' "rice balls would be confusing to western audiences" is great.
The only part of this video that's april fools is the damn seaweed strip
I'mma show this to noble lost pause
If you ever need to make more anime food, i recommend watching Golden Kamuy. There's a huge emphasis on food, but in true anime fashion, the show gets very strange.
Someone send this to Lost Pause
was trolled
How dare you not make your own homemade jelly to fill your donut
Where's the rice 🤔
Brock's "doughnuts are actually onigiri, rice balls, usually filled with tuna or meat or verge, like a sandwich, wrapped in nori.  The doughnut thing was a weird localization thing, & now I look like an ass for falling for this
BUT IT'S NOTA JELLY FILLED DONUT!! AAARGH


Edit: AWW WAIT! FUUUUUU NOW I GET IT. IT'S A APRIL FOOLS VIDEO
The English version of Pokemon wrongfully called them donuts but every onigiri I've seen and had is savory containing seaweed and rice as the base and various fillings and are honestly very delicious

//edit// I've been had but super excited for the real video!
"Mmmmmm donuts"
-Homer Simpson
If you turn the sound off, it becomes a primitive technology video.
Wait did he say to let it rest for an hour or for one well oiled hour
As a world renowned chef, I demand you do an episode based on Kevin cooks stuff from the office
Lol they say jelly donuts even though they are clearly not  HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA
Thanks! I hate it!
Banish babish
Oh so I guess it wasn’t a translation error...
I was so confused till I realised it's April fools.
you had me going! the whole time i was cringing and thinking, "THATS NOT ONIGIRI!" lol
BABISH!!!!!!! YOU GOTTA DO THE STEAK AND EGGS FROM TWISTER 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼RIP Phillip Seymour Hoffman!
I see a bunch of videos that don’t make sense in my sub box.
Everyone’s changing their Twitter names to characters from Tv shows.

And then remember what day it is.
I am so glad you said April fools hoping you were not loosing it there
Umbrella eww, jelly filled onigiri (riceballs)
Just add some pollen, and you win at my personal allergy bingo.
Guys I think "supple" might be his favorite word. That and "smooth"
I Know this was posted today on April fool's but I can't help but feel slightly annoyed at this and I know I shouldn't BUT HERE I AM 😡
April Fools or not, those look mf'n delightful.
You got me. I legit weeb-raged for like the first 90 seconds of this video.
This is genius. I love this.
I remember being so confused by this as a wee lad.
heavy breathing
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Sweet Jesus
I dont get the joke...
How does it tastes tho?
Oh good, you're actually gonna make onigiri. Thank god.
I new this was a April fools joke after there was no rice involved
I guess this works but was expecting the Turducken from Red Vs Blue. Plus, April 1st is RvB's anniversary so it works better.

EDIT: The recipe is you start with a hummingbird, Put that in a sparrow, stuff them both in a cornish hen, then put that in a chicken. Put all that in a duck, then in a turkey, then in a bigger turkey (Donald Trump works, but in the original they use Micheal Moore), Put that in a penguin , stuff that in a peacock, then an eagle, shove it all in an albatross, then an emu, next comes an ostrich, then a leopard, Put all that in a pterodactyl, and then stuff it in a Boeing 747.
They look like rice balls filled with sour Japan plums mixed with dried fish and I forgot what the other ingredient is but it’s translated to delicious
Amazing! Brock would be proud!
Needs more raw jellyfish in the filling.
I always thought that green strip was seaweed and the white outside was rice😅
This is like bob ross but cooking.
If u wanted it to be believable u should have used rice but u probably didn’t cuz u said April fools
Those are not Japanese they came from the Uzbek and russian culture
I dont get this meme
This is exactly how April Fool's videos should be. Giving quality content that happens to be a joke, rather than getting the fans' hopes up with something they've been wanting for a long time, only to be disappointed to find out it's just a joke.
Everybody calls attention to Onigiri Donuts, but nobody mentions Riceball Popcorn.
i lik donot. its tes gude
Did Babish just rick roll us with doughnuts?
Ummm.... That's sushi brock.
Ok good the weeb in me was starting to rise up until the end.
Just confused. I don't know anything about pokeman or Japanese donut making. Oh well I still got to hear that voice! 😍
I was just about to comment on how appalled I was but then realized the date... I was actually about to leave a rant on onigiris😂
Pokemon why you fool all them childrens into being culturally unaware
Stand? IS THAT A JOJO'S REFERENCE?
looking back on it how on earth did 4kids get away with calling those donuts. Kids aren't allowed to hear about rice balls until later in life?
This was not a april fools joke he made a second video on this but what is the coincedince that it was made on april the first
So when are you gonna do the real thing?
What’s your least favorite thing about cilantro: its flavor, its known toxicity, or its role in the subprime mortgage crisis?
Me: nodding along sagely to the toasted spices, choice of chicken
Also me: currently eating microwaved hot dogs
3:05 "Don't do that, that's how you get dead" is my new favourite line
Nobody:
Binging with Babish: let those flavors get to know each other
Please, i'm begging you. Write the ingredients in metric too.
Pro tip: REALLY cook down the onion + garlic + ginger before the tomato goes in!
"that's how you get DEAD" I crackled
Babish; If you want to enjoy cilantro like the rest of us, look into Culantro. I grow it myself because it's relatively hard to find, but sometimes it's available in Vietnamese markets, if you have those around you. It tastes exactly like cilantro but doesn't have the chemical compound that you have an aversion to - meaning it doesn't taste like soap.


I get my seeds online from Kitazawa Seeds - Look for Culantro or Ngo Gai.
Can you make treetrunks famous apple pie from adventure Time
1:26 - "four is probably fine"

You know, that's exactly what my wife says.
Me thinks that the phallus shaped ginger at 2:20 is placed there for our amusement Babby? ;-)
"That's how you get..."
Me: Salmonella?
" D E A D "
Me: oh yeah that too
That ginger is particularly suspicious looking.






Looks familiar
Babish you forgot that India sepertaed from the UK :(
5:08 so... when does a new website become an old website :)?
1:00 was that... a Steve1989MREInfo reference?
While I usually love your stuff you've committed the cardinal sin of North Indian cuisine

You gotta use that ghee dude
None of that oil stuff

It's go ghee or go home
In the UK your local takeaway place will always make a better Tika Masala than you can make at home. Good cook though!
advice from an indian -> dont do this in your house, buy a grill/stove for your backyard and do it there.
[God Save The Queen Intensifies]
Curry powder without kurcuma? Wtf?
Do a Turturkeykey from How I met your mother..love the show btw..
Looks perfect. But tbh I'll just end up going to tesco for the tikka sauce. :(
Hey babish, can you explore Indian cuisine more? I'd love to see Hyderabadi biryani or butter chicken. I have a feeling Indian cuisine is right up your alley
A bit westernized version of tikka masala. But extremely good none the less. Love you Babish, from 🇵🇰
why bake the rice I meber heard of this before..someone explain please is it better?
Hey Andrew
You should use darker cuts of meat while cooking Indian food.
The curry tastes way better
Hey could you make the el burdigato supreme from teen titans go
just kidding, don't do that, that's how you get ded


I laughed so hard
Mango lassi is going to be my favorite episode
What's the difference between it and butter chicken and korma?
DO THE PEANUT BUTTER CEREAL SMOOTHIE FROM BENNY AND JOON 
OR THE TAPIOCA
I tried this recipe and it changed my life. I never knew I could make a curry that tastes so good. Genuinely restaurant-quality food right here.
Congratulations on getting 4mil subs man! You da best cooking channel.
thank you for this, please continue with more indian cuisine related tutorials.
tip: use a motor and pestle  instead of a grinder
This is the restaurant version....
Tikka is bbq chicken and we use the whole chicken cut into 16 pieces
can you try making Maple syrup Honey Brown Sugar, Molasses, Rice Krispie Log from the Golden Girls? it might be good to have something to pound your den with
hi andrew,

im from Germany (sorry for grammar in the first place) i would love if you make a schnitzel episode its very easy and in my country 100% a basic 

Greetings from Germany

What beer would you serve with that? Kingfisher or Taj Mahal?
YAAAAAY!! Congratulations on the 4mil!! Kudos from a huge fan from Finland!

Oh wait, just let me get a teaspoon from my bag of sugar.

I noticed you left a piece of the chili on the stove...do you recommend we do the same? @bingingwithbabish
"National dish of the UK" 
Nice one
you should make the sandwich from team fortress 2.
It seemed easy, but was hard to understand him.
He sounded like football commentator!
Singing instead of talking his words!
lol 😝 ‼️
Umm you missed the most important spice... Turmeric Powder no chicken tikky masala without turmeric.
DO PRETTY PATTIES FROM SPONGE BOB! 
DO BASICS WITH BABISH FOR FRIED CHICKEN! LOVE YOU!
Cilantro is definitely a split taste. Those who like it love it and those who don't despise it. The way I see it, More for me!!!
I love your channel, thanks for the content and recipes.
"That's how you get dead." Not if you're already dead inside👌
"That's how you get dead" Babish 2019
You could’ve done this in a regular episode because this was part of a joke between a couple in an episode of black mirror 🤷🏼‍♀️
Naan, yes, I'd love to see how you'd manage that in a home. Also, excellent stuff, Babish :)
Can u make the Jimbo Burger from The Simpsons?
B O N E L E S S
No turmeric???! Shiva the Destroyer is coming for you Babish...
Legit will give my left nut for a Swedish meatball vid
I still cant tell if he's being sarcastic about the coffee grinder/spice grinder thing
“Thats how you get dead” HAHAHA 😂😂 i laughed out loud
Please make Summer Ramen from We Bare Bears episode, "Ramen"
Believe it or not........
The best tikka Masala of my life..........
Was in Phoenix!
ThaT'S hOw YoU gET DeAd!!!
You underestimated the power of chicken thighs in this recipe;  they're the best cut you can use in curries. But I love you still Babs, and I'll, for sure, try this recipe.
Congrats on 4 million subscribers!!!

Andrew :)
Dear Babish,
I challenge you to make all 77 sandwiches from that one Bob's Burgers episode.

-Sincerely, a loyal viewer.




P.S.
All 77 sandwiches were not mentioned but there was a scene where sandwiches were shown assembled and counted down from the menu and during the credits, they named some of the 77 sandwiches.
that chicken needs some love. is begging for a grill.
and the sauce needs cashews paste.
"That's how you get dead"
Next you should make 'Vsauce' from 'Vsauce!'
When you bent down to smell the spices my 6 yr old said "what? Hes bald??" 😅😅
use x3 times more chili flakes
Yay, finally you've branched out from European food and done Asian,I'm so happy
>the UKs national dish

JUST
whoa whoa whoa back up


was that a meringue eggs benedict i saw in the intro?
Love this track by Blue Wednesday 😍
Store bought curry powder vs home made is exactly the same. Change my mind.
i just now noticed there's ingredient lists. I work at a private school, and we have kids who live on campus that I feed on weekends and it's real real slow compared to the week so I try and do atleast a couple videos of your videos a month on the weekends. Seeing your lists in the description is gonna save me so much time running around the coolers and dry storage pausing and collecting rewinding pausing and collecting ingredients.
when the first slide shot happened with the rough chicken I lost it LMAO
Babish : that's how you get dead

Me :*looks up how deadly raw chicken is*

Me : oh you mean DEAD dead.
Whenever Babish is grating garlic like that, I get an involuntary chill up and down my spine thinking about inadvertently grating fingertips with the garlic.
Anyone here from YSAC take on this?
Chicken tikka without heat? April is still a few days away, my man.
Could you make the isotope dog supreme from the Simpsons?
Nino would have made chicken masala using a cow
This looks fantastic! Thoughts on doing a video about Vindaloo?
Did you allow the spices to cool before grinding?
This and butter chicken are my favorite. I never make it though because I don't have all the spices needed yet.
Hey Andrew! Can you please do a basics with babish or binging with babish episode on Cajun/creole dishes like gumbo and/or jambalaya? Thanks! Love your channel!
From this day on, I will only refer to coriander seeds as "Cilantro Babies". Thanks Babby!
Can u make a Good Burger with Ed's secret sauce
Well now that youve tackled English / Indian Curry... 
How about taking a stab at Asian Curry... might i suggest a personal favorite.. Phenang ?
One of our favorite meals is Tandoori Chicken, but my husband and I always get mixed up and call it Tikka Masala (actually Tikki Masala 🤦‍♀️)
Aw, heck yeah! I love Tikka Masala! And I've never been able to make good naan. I'm looking forward to it!
Sounds delicious, but me personally i prefer to use coconut milk instead of heavy cream. It brightens u a lot of the flavors and goes extremely well with those spices
Making this Saturday, thanks bro!
Yooo 4M subs!! Happy for you❤
3:47 RIP piece of Bird's Eye Chili :(
Chai tea - tea tea 
Nan bread - bread bread
Chicken tikka masala - chicken chicken spice
I can't not keep thinking about You suck at cooking's version of this😂
You should do shrimp part from the goldbergs- or a special with more recipies
Interesting how he said some of the Paki/Indi words. I'm first Gen American and parents are from Pakistan/India. Can't wait to see how you do the other dishes. Interesting on your take of Tikka Masala. Nice job.
Thank you. I love your presention style. Can't wait to try this recipe!
"Don't do that, that's how you get dead." - Babish 2019
That curry powder in our language is called GARAM MASALA😂
'thats how you get dead' is exactly the way i speak and it made me laugh out loud, thank you
You should try making kimchi ^w^ I totally want to learn how :D
2:19 lol the only thing I was waiting for in this whole video was to hear how Babish said “Tikka Masala” 😂😂😂

And I will say I am content knowing he was gonna screw up the name. 😂😂
Replicate the raspberry danish food that the queen gave to the kid in Narnia!
Babish, I must confess.

I followed your channel simply because I liked your cooking. I never expected anything outside of that. 

But now, more than a year in, I have to say, there is something inherently attractive about seeing you lean on your countertop, flashing your growing tattoo collection, highlighting whatever dish you've demonstrated for us, that has really won me over on a multitude of levels.


Good on you, dude. I'm loving these basics episodes. But also, hey, lookin' good, man lol worrrrrk
2:20 is this...
is this intentional
look carefully
Isn’t it bad to grind the whole cardamom pod?
Everyone else: sauce pan

Andrew: saucepin
It doesn't count unless you have Gulab Jamun for dessert
I thought this is gonna be something from Hang the DJ
Hey babish, so I have a request for u? One piece is my favorite show and I love cooking been watching your channel since the 4th video u ever uploaded, but anyway I was wondering if u could make the curry from one piece season 2 eps. 133 “a recipe handed down, Sanji the iron man of curry!” If u could that would be so awesome tbh idk if they give all the ingredients but if still love to see u take a crack at it. 
Thankyou, George.
"Thats how you get dead" 💀🤣
Please always use fresh tomatoes in a curry. It tastes completely different.

Wouldn't give the curry that bright orange colour but makes a significant difference in taste.
"Don't do that, that's how you get dead"
You just say that because you've never tried Peggy Hill's chicken tartare
Lets get these chicken pieces out onto a (rimmed baking) tray... nice!
you have no idea how long I've been waiting for this episode
You tease us too much with these Steve1989 references, my guy.
Why is nobody talking about that ginger at 2:20 lol, oh well love your vid man keep making more
Missed out ground almond as a texture enhancer and sweetener though!
If anyone knows any Indian takeaways, within a 2 mile radius from Peckham (south london), let me know. 🔽
Congratulations on 4 million subscribers my dude!
You had me at “chicken”.
Thank you thank you THANK YOU for making cooking amazing dinner seem so possible! Im making this this week and I'm so excited to have something different from my usual prepackaged crap!!
Hey babish, i started cooking this year because i go to university now. My dorm mates asked me to cook for them once, i saw this video and wondered if you have a good recipe for butter chicken, thanks a lot man.
Butter chicken has to be my favourite, though they are similar.
You should make tiny tina's crumpets from borderlands 2
MAKE HIMYM foods (tantrum,stinsons hangover fixer elixir, best burger in NY, seven layer salad, sumbitches)
hey babish! I saw your bao video, i dare u to try and do some wontons. My mom makes everything from scratch, it's hard lol
Make the kelp shake from spongebob
Instructions unclear.
I caugh the dead.
This looks delicious! I'm going to go make it now.




By now I mean beans and rice. D,: I can't cook like this.
If this is beginner, I'm already in trouble. I don't own most of those spices.
Some of these spices are hard to find where I live. Can I use store-bought curry powder?

Congratulations on 4 million subscribers.I watch you for a long time and you deserve it.
Making you own curry shows the dedication. Well played.
I would've been SO happy if you made Butter Chicken. Struggling to find a top recipe!
Cue ALL the Indians telling you all the key, important, essential, 'it-ain't-tikka-masala-if-you-don't-do-(insert step)' comments...lol! Don't worry, we do this to Indians posting Indian recipes too!
Monk fish turducken from malcolm in the middle plz
ROFL.."yup, 4 is probably ok." I guess you weren't feeling the power of greyskull.
In your masala, you forgot the lemon, and garam masala, and lots of kashmiri chilli powder.
I personally like even more spice. Heat is always better.

Could you make butter chicken or crispy noodle chow mein?
How can this taste even halfway decent without the fond?

Cook your chicken in the pot!
Fresh coriander roughly chopped so you don't bruise the leaves
Chicken tikka masala is my favorite dish 😍 Though I don’t think I’m quite ready to tackle making it on my own. I’ll leave that up to the professionals at my favorite local Indian restaurant.
Well in India I eat this quite commonly, but damn are the spices expensive
I kinda want to see your version of Kashmiri food. 🤔
Ah, yes.  A simple recipe with only one infinity ingredients.
I’ve been waiting for this for a year bro
Hey Babish can you update your “Bangers with Babish” Spotify playlist?
A world-renowned Indian dish...invented in Scotland.

Damn legit just got on YouTube and see a nice surprise
Babish there's a Saudi dish called Kabsa, and when I eat it I usually bite into cardamom or cloves, help
"Ok people so on today's episode of basics we're going to forget our intro"
The Wasabi Chicken Wings from The Simpsons would be awesome to make. Love your content man!
i would never cook with clove

What you don’t want to chew on whole spices? Don’t go for the biryani then lol
'..Kidding, thats how you get, DEAD..' LOL
I was planning on making a mushroom curry tonight but was unsure of the recipe. Thanks for showing up with one I can use (with the obvious substitution of mushrooms for the chicken).
Did you just eat Tikka Masala without Naan?!?
National dish of the UK
The best chicken Tikka masala is still the one my mom makes. 
Sorry, Babish
I'm SO glad you didn't say "bread" after "naan"
Use ghee not oil
Ghee is basically clarified butter
No cilantro for me bro try garnish with a couple of thin slices of red onion
Cilantro smells like BO. I can't.
Any Indian here Judging Babish on his every step of cooking 😂😂 At least I did ...🤣 Though Babish you did good..
The way he said lassi reminded me of jusreign🤣
How can you have curry powder without curry leaves? 🧐
Could you make the soup or the special order from ratatouille please.
I would LOVE to see you try your hand at Wolfgang Puck’s Oscar dishes! There’s a video on YouTube about how he makes it and OH BOY I just want to learn through your videos how to make such a dish (:
But! Totally sabotaged the recepy.
Try Ceylon if you can find it.

And ask someone how to use a knife maybe....
If you never done it before, can you make the Bug Malasada from the games Pokemon Sun/Moon and Pokemon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon?
2:20 that Ginger looks quite "interesting". I mean you did that on purpose, right? :D
I learned today that coriander and cilantro are the same thing. My mind is blown
Shouldnt you mix the sause with a hand mixer before you put in the chicken.
Great video as always
Can you please do some thai recipes like green curry,penang and others, LOVE YOUR TUTORIALS <3
Make the el burdigato supreme from teen tians go
Thought you were gonna say "that's how you get salmonella" but you just jumped straight to "dead" which I feel is more appropriate tbh hahah
I have an idea for sandwich assembly. Recreate the Sandwich from TF2. Because for all intensive purposes, that sandwich is a fairly simple yet elegantly made.
"Saucepin."
Should make Glen wads from accepted
So I decided to make Tikka Masala this morning and went to the grocery store to get what I needed for my normal recipe which is really good.

Then this appears and I now need to go back to the grocery store 😡
my new catch phrase, "that's how you get dead"
I'm just glad he didn't say nan BREAD
3:55 
That little piece of chili hanging out on the right. Help that poor boy out.
Good thing Gordon Ramsay wont say "chicken shitta masala" cuz this looks good than the roasted twitter dude
* insert quote from the video we all just watched
If we're doing currys, please make a balti
I'm going to show this to my mom and see if she approves
Edit: the only thing my mom thought was crazy was that you cook your rise in the oven 😂
Lord of the Rings Salted Pork
Chicken tikka masala is not the UK's national dish, though it is that of London
After roasting you need to leave the spices to cool down so they become crisp, if you blend them immediately, the blend won't be as fine and a lot of the flavors will be lost.
Mango Lassi please! Would love to find a good recipe to make at home.

I have literally no intention of making any of the things I watch this man cook lol, these videos are so addictive though
"UK's national dish" i died xD
Hey that’s not curry powder that’s garam masala 🙂
lets break it into 6 pieces 
struggles
4 is probably fine lmao
‘The UK’s national dish’
Eh, fair
This most certainly is a UK dish and I love it. And now I will try to make it myself with probably mixed results! =P
Cooking should be pleasurable. If it's not, get a takeaway.
"thats how you get dead"
It looks good but everyone knows the UK Tikka Masala has to be the most unnatural bright red possible to be perfect.
Olive oil? Nah mate you're good
Ooo please do naan. Naan is the best and I want to know how to make the real stuff.
Congratulations on 4 Mil, your videos are so entertaining :)
The spices that you grind is not called curry powder. It is called "Garam Masala" or loosely translated as "Masala Salt".
Another thing that can be added to the dish is a fried boil egg or just a boil egg into the sauce together with the chicken.

Overall, lovely recipe. I love it. Thanks.
"That's how you get dead " lol
Thanks for this recipe and love your way of going through the recipe! I get heavy migraines from tomato paste so I'm not adding that. Is there anything I can change it for?
Cultural Appropriation at it's finest !
You should cook for Gordon Ramsay and hopefully he doesn't say "its raw". Lol
Can you make the tf2 sandvich?
Thank you so much for this. Me and the family love this recipe! We prepare it at the weekend and freeze some for the times we usually would have ordered take out. We experimented with coconut milk instead of heavy creme and when you season it a bit more this adds some interesting touch to the dish.
Make black spaghetti from jojo
“Just kidding, that’s how you get dead”

You should do the Olympics of sandwiches and make all 77 of Patricia's 77 sandwiches
4:57 I thought you said none instead of naan

Never clicked so fast on one of your Videos 😍
Cilantro can ride out of here on the horse it rode in on...

Bold of you to assume I don't wanna die.
I would love to see a basics episode that tackles pork/veg dumplings. Please?! :D
So much fun watching your delicious recipes!
Thigh meat is better in every single way for this recipe.
Naan is super easy to make actually, at least a passable version of it, it's a simple dough rolled out flat then cooked on dry cast iron. Whenever I make tikka masala I have to make naan.

Tastes so good
When it’s insoide my moutthhh 🎶
I thought in the King of the Hill episode you said that Sugar doesn't actually help offset acidity?
I've learned from another certain cooking channel that for this dish everything comes out of a can
Wow! This video was actually my 5000th liked video! I'm pretty happy about that :) MUCH LOVE ANDREW!
okay why has no one commented on how choppy the intro sounds/has always sounded
"Full Fat Yoghurt." Fernando would be proud
I swear Indian food is the best cuisine in the world. It's literally a flavor explosion every time you eat. My mouth is watering now....I think I'm gonna go order this.
I too share the dreaded rs72921001  - fist bump
More UK indian dishes pls. also babish if u could do more sous vide recipes
the joke about eating raw chicken is exactly what I am here for
your intro track sounds like it was approved by a test group that's never seen you channel.
Babish you gotta go back to the basics never add oil to water 😭😭😭
Episode 37 is #37 on trending
May I suggest the Curry from Persona 5 (PS4), a very nice game, though you would easly need 60+hours of play to get the subtle details about this particular dish.
Nice video super👍👍👏👏👌👌👌👌💞💞💞
Is there gonna be a 4mil special?
It smells windows tech-support in here
Just measure the ginger.  Two tbsp maybe?
Babish I’ve been waiting on these basics for three weeks now. Thank you for posing this
MANGO LASSI RECIPE PLS! Lol
I'm pretty excited about the other Indian recipes that Babish will be making on this show
3:01 for a moment I was like, "wtf?"
Will you do larb or some kind of Thai curry?
This guy is Casually Explained his cousin
Make sure to crush your garlic before using it, it releases this thing called allicin. Which I believe is good for you
‘That’s how you get dead’ that line almost killed me 😂
You should try and make another UK dish, the parmesan
Maybe I like to pull rock hard cloves from between my teeth.....you don't know me.....🤷‍♀️
As a brit, where this won our meal of the country. I can confirm chief, this ain't it.
You should do the chicken with fruit loops from Eddie’s Million Dollar Cook Off
Adding a tsp of ghee and whole cumin to rice would change it's taste . I don't even need anything to go with it
Tikka is woodpecker in Finnish. Useless facts, you're welcome.
Ok look I know your probably not going to see this but can you please make a merch line or at least put "Smooth and Supple" on a t-shirt.
Nah not like gravy more like sauce tikka
Too much yogurt and less Masala.... that's the remark......
Made it and absolutely loved it! I just have to say though,,,, the way you say "saucePN" use to annoy me to death but I've gotten used to it and secretly I've even began to like it , now while I was making this very dish my wife caught me saying it like that out loud myself! In response I just admitted to her that indeed Babish broke me!
 so from now on we " tiny-Hewhisk" in our "saucePN" and damn proud of it too!
Epic gamer moment
I'm not sure you ever know what you're doing.
Have you ever thought in a binging with europe tour?
I'm an Indian and i can say this is a wonderfully perfect recipe, and also just a tip, if you don't like topping it up with Cilantro, you can always try fresh Coriander!!
You can rest those micro plane graters on the bowl your grating into to take the pressure off your wrist
When a notification for a babish upload interrupts you while watching a babish video
Happy 4mil Subscribers!!!
Jk don’t do that that’s how you get dead. 😂
KORMA!?!?! you savage
"Chow down. Just kidding, don't do that. That's how you get dead!" lol. I never thought to make my own curry powder but that doesn't look that tough and if it's as good as you say, i'm sure it's well worth the effort. Thanks!
ha british food 



FIGHT ME IT WAS MADE IN GLASGOW THERE GOD DAM ANIMALS UP THERE 

 BUT BALTIS WHERE MADE IN BIRMINGHAM SO HA
Are you saying saw-spin?
swear you already did a poutine episode. Please do one
What the watch you are wearing? It's never fully in focus and I'm curious!
I wanna see a collab.
I want HowToBasics with Babish.
I have always shied away from making curry as it's a strange to me, but this video is definetely inspiring me to try and make some! I truly appreciate making the spice mix from scratch! Looks fabulous

Also... that's the biggest sugar bag I have ever seen!
If you are one of the ~1\10 people with the mutation that makes cilantro taste soapy, just substitute parsley instead.
One of my favorite meals. Going to try it out this week!
"Kidding, don't do that. That's how you get dead." Best cooking quote I've ever heard 10/10
I really want you to do a collab with You Suck At Cooking, you two would be the best omg
Making this for my family tonight, except with some veges added. Can't wait!
thank you for doing indian food its intersting to see how you do it, because its different from my mothers
I love these videos but i feel like these are getting pretty distant from "basics"
Hey Andrew, I am Indian and I grew up on chicken tikka masala. This is near authentic. I send my mum this video and she said you are WRONG, you gotta add a lot of pepper, like a tone of bird's eye pepper and then you are right.
Congrats on 4 million subscribers. It’s been fantastic watching your channel grow.
I love how he believes 1tbsp of chilli is hot, dude u should meet my mother, she would LAUGH
Hey, Babish, do Lamb Josh Rogan next?
Tikka Masala was invented in my home city of Glasgow, purely because in the 70's the curries were too strong so tikka masala was invented as a "white people friendly" option
I just ate dinner, but somehow this still managed to make me hungry.

Can you make the 7 layer parfait flambé from Bob’s Burgers end of course larp episode? I bet that would be amazing
Could u make butter chickennn
So gooood. I can smell it from my screen.
Cilantro is overrated. I know a lot of people love it, and a lot more people love to cook with it, but I just think it's overpowering. It tastes like fresh mint on steroids. I don't want to taste that much freshness.
Dear BingingWithBabish,

The Elder Scrolls just made a cook book that has dishes from each of the 10 in-game races:

Altmer, Argonians, Bosmer, Bretons, Dunmer, Khajiit, Imperials, Nords, Orcs, and Redguards

You know what that means?!?

SKYRIM SPECIAL NOW, MILK DRINKER! YOU CAN'T IGNORE ME FOREVER BABISH! I WILL DO THE BLACK SACRAMENT ON YOU AND SEE TO IT YOUR SOUL WILL FOREVER BE DEVOURED BY SITHIS, I MEAN IT!



Love,

Ya boi Vex.
Chicken Tikka Massala is my favorite
37th episode and #37 on trending hmmmmm
When I see how much heavy cream goes into it I'm like, "Oh yeah, now I remember why I never make Chicken Tikka Masala".
UK food is great and all, but what about Filipino Food?
if you cut some of the cream and add pureed cashews (that have been soaked) it adds a lot of richness and a subtle nuttiness. ps. peanut butter works really well and saves time
These could have been inculcated into the recipe as well. 



- Turmeric and red chilly powder for the remnant fiery taste
- Asafoetida for a more savory flavour
- Fresh Bay Leaves (Duh!)
- Coconut Milk to balance the acidity without offsetting the sweetness and avoiding sugar.
"that's how you get dead" approx 3% of BwB's fanbase is now dead

Look at all that cooking stuff i cant afford welp drives to burger king
I know that you had a cold when you recorded the square space bit. but could you please rerecord it?
My genetics hate me...all I taste is soap when it comes to cilantro. :-(
I grew up having a Hindu step father so I've learned a lot about Indian cuisine in the last 18 years and you forgot 2 crucial elements, turmeric and GHEE it's always so so much better with ghee(which my grandmother used to make homemade before she passed)
Fun Fact, Chicken Tikka Masala was created in Glasgow Scotland
I disagree - get boneless skinless chicken thighs - flavour is what matters. 
Cook out your onion, ginger and garlic nicely till they get soft with some colour on them before adding the tomatoes.
lassi isn't pronounced lassey , its pronounced lus-ee.
Lol you put those cinn sticks in there too omg
Babish I am shook, my girlfriend and I literally just talked about making this ourselves but gave up finding a suitable recipe and ordered from the local Indian restaurant 😂 thanks for making it so easy!
He forgot the pint of Cobra!!!

“That’s how you get DEAD”
"Just kidding, don't do that, that's how you get dead"
"sospn"
Did I hear a subtle nod to Steve1989 when he moved the spice mixture to the stove?  Nice.
Wait. I'm confused. Isn't Bird's eye pepper just another name for Chile Tepin? Why does yours look like a jalapeño/Serrano?
I don't even know why I watch this channel it just makes me hungry and I know ill never even make the food...
Wouldn’t curry leaves be needed to make curry? Genuine question from a clueless fellow.
Please make some Kacchi Biryani next... It's made with mutton, but I'm not sure if it's the same thing as mutton biryani. I once saw them both on a menu, so....
I chowed down when you said. I'm dead now.

2:21 pecker shaped ginger. Your welcome
Make a bon-bon from spongebob!!!!
You should make The Deji.
"I hope you give this a try yourself..." - That's someChef John action here.
Instead of grill the chicken (become dry), I prefer slow cook them inside the sauce with a small fire and let the sauce observed by the meat, taste more delicious.
50$ worth of ingredients.  dang.
I will never not love an MRE reference
Where's Bubba's Shrimp part 2 Babish?
No curry leaves in the "curry powder"?
My mom made this and it was so good!
FINALLY 😩👌 I have my own Tikka recipe so I want to see how it compares
You should do one about marinades
Please do a Lord Of The Rings episode.
I have made this with thighs before, it works just fine (definitely is richer)
I use coconut milk instead and that works too.
This is great, Andrew! Can we veg folks get a chana (chickpea) masala video someday? I'd love to see your process on that one and how you bypass the annoying task of peeling every individual chickpea before cooking.

(Also for vegetarians that want to try this recipe, buy some paneer and sub it in for the chicken! Paneer butter masala is incredible.)
Alright let’s be real for a sec....



When is binging with babish gonna have Is own restraunt called “The Babish”
Already decided to make this for dinner! The chicken is marinading and I'm looking up good naan recipes while I wait. The spices made my kitchen smell INCREDIBLE!

You should make food inspired by How I Met Your Mother
disliking cilantro, despite being a genetic trait or not, makes you weak as a human being

but Babish is so powerful that even with that weakness, he's still above most of us all
WHY DID HE CUT THE CHICKEN ON A WOODEN CUTTING BOARD?!😂 This looks delicious, I will defiantly try this
your voice reminds me of the narrator from A Series of Unfortunate Events
cilantro, what the heck is that. Do you mean coriander?
“Kidding. Don’t do that. That’s how you get dead.” 😂
Bruh you need turmeric (Haldi)
It looks like an overly gourmet strogonoff.
Who else wants to see Babish and Gordon Ramsay have a cook off?

So does this mean you are going to make the coffee and curry from persona 5?
Since you made the Portal cake, you should make the Half Life casserole.

I diagnose you with dead
i feel like rice may be a mistake but i wont trust it
You should have done this from RIPD with Ryan Reynolds in it
I would sub the processed sugar to light brown sugar or raw..
The local food in the Middle East just throws whole cardamom into everything. Pretty sure they’re working on a way to get cardamom pods into the tap water
Just for some additional flavour use mustard oil instead of olive oil
Saucepin you say
I paused the video at 3:03 thinking you were supposed to eat it raw and now all my family are dying. Please help
i dont know why but i sneezed when you opened the spice grinder.
You used fake cinnamon!

You should make this Arabic stew called Fasah! I live in Hamtramk, MI and there is a place here that makes this killer tuna Fasah with homemade pita bread and it's just so good

Tikka masala is mine and my moms favorite
Just add a cube of butter at the end enjoy the miracle of Indian food.
Thanks for being so transparent when you're being paid to promote something
That's how you get d e a d
Wait. Also. I love you.
By curry powder you mean garam masala.
You should do an episode over the Curry Buns from the anime Black Butler
Indian is my favorite "region of food". Thanks for showing us this. I'll have to try it, especially making my own curry powder! :)
Made this recipe a while ago, you can't get it wrong. It's delicious.
My mom makes the marinade the day before. Let's the flavors infuse.
Would love to see how to make some of the vegetarian Indian options (especially palak paneer)
The only reason I know what this is is from that YSAC episode...
India!!!!
Namaskar, Babish. Going Indian today, aheh?
Missing chilli powder and turmeric from the marinade and masala. Essentially you need to make a a tandoori chicken and then and to the masala.
I also agree making your own curry powder gharam masala powder etc etc is always the better choice of your able to afford it.
Um, did you really grate a whole nut of nutmeg into your powder?
Cause if yes, that is dangerously close to overdosing on nutmeg, seriously.
Nutmeg in the dosage of one or two nutmegs can cause a hallucinatory drug episode, and for higher dosages or intolerant people it literally can mean death.
INDIAN FOOOOOOOOOOD
Back of a knife works for ginger as well.
Congrats on 4 mil babby
Will you upload a Binging with Babish "Home Brew" special, featuring the NBC sitcom "Cheers" (1982-1993)?
Pro tip from an Indian, cook your onions and tomatoes very well, I mean very very well till the oil seperates out and onions and tomatoes all melted, only then add the spices.
2:25 spoon your garlic with a spoon***
Agreed, get that cilantro out of there!
you forgot fresh coriander and it should roughly chopped up so you don't bruise the leaves and coconut milk is better than cream also add some coconut to the sauce also
We use half the spice powder you made instead of just a pinch.
You should make your take on an pan galactic gargle blaster!
The Best Drink in Existence...
Sauce pin.
Thighs, so much better flavor.... and can stand up to sitting in the sauce if you want to thicken it.
Believe it or not...the best tikki masala of my life...was in Phoenix

Would I marinate beef the same way?

Wait, ain't this a flavor of a durex condom?!
2:20 THAT'S A DICK
Love it!!! Would also love to see you make some vegetarian/vegan dishes. I love your channel but as someone who doesn’t eat meat there aren’t many of your recipes I can actually accomplish.
You know what else is missing?  Six pints of Lager.
Do biryani
babish, please don't ever pronounce the T in "soften" again ;)
love cilantro, suck it haters
If only I could afford the chicken

Or anything ;-;

Instructions not clear I serenaded the chicken
I’m clearly wrong but I always thought of masala as the sort of cornbread mix that goes in a corn husk to make tamales. I though I was about to FINALLY learn what was in that delicious mix. I’ve eaten a lot of them but never even tried to cook one.
Interestingly, the chicken tikka masala was actually created in the UK and not India
Why do you say "saucepin"?
Butter chicken?
I love this stuff^^
This ain't UKs national dish.They stole that from us along with our independence and the Kohinoor diamond.
The "basics" part in "Basics with Babish" has ceased to have any meaning, I see.
my god that voice
My heart dropped 3:01
originates from scotland
4:39 - “Then spoon a generous portion of the UK’s national dish” 
😂😂😂😂







It is.
Making your own curry powder and then using canned tomatoes feels so backwards.
Wow! Im so happy for this dish
For such a customizeable dish as this I'm kinda paralyzed at where to start in terms of changing it up. It would be nice to have had an overview of what sort of things could be added or subtracted/changed without ruining the dish and what sort of flavor differences it would make.
Hit a like of you like indian curries👍
Dude love your vids but God are they over exposed.... turn that saturation down editor. Ain't nobody's tomatoes that red even if they San Moranos
It looks spicy
Blend tomatoes, onions, garlic and chillies. Fry until you can scrape and see bottom of the pan. Add garam and chana masala powder and continue to fry for 10-15 mins. Perfect generic masala for tons of Indian dishes
Designed in Scotland.... class
in the next one, teach how to make "mole"
2:20 That ginger looks pretty phallic.
no tumeric???
Why do you call the seeds by coriander but not the leaves? I knew that Americans called the leaved differently but I assumed it would at least be consistent.
Made this last week to specifications. I wept with joy.

The only issue I have with making curries from scratch is the number of spices you need which unless you are making curries regularly are just going to go to waste.
Currently eating with naam
@2:20 no one's gonna mention the ginger? lol

Four million subs!
Is it saucepan or saucepin
I just wanna say thank you so much! Your channel is the main reason I started eating right and really cooking in a variety and appreciating food more. It definitely got me through having a kitchen for the first time in Undergrad and it's been keeping me constantly exploring and trying to get better at cooking!
You gotta do papadoms
Am i the only one who had to rewind the video to look at Babish Dong Ginger?

Congratulations on 4 Million Subs, Babi!
Next video:  butter chicken
Can't wait for more Indian dishes
This is my husband’s favorite dish. I will try making it sometime. Usually he just gets it takeout.
This looks appetizing but no desi food is ours. We do half the steps and make it equally good tasting.
Could you go through how to make  tiramisu plz
After investigating about the onions, some recommend grinding the onions in a food processor to make a 'creamier' onion sauce. Rather than using a finely chopped saute mix. I'd probably saute, then blend it. Perfecting a curry is life.
Just kidding that's how you get D E A D
What kind of watch/ watch band is in this episode?
You forgot to give the first bite to the queen! Someone slap this man with a herring

美味しそう😋😋😋😋😋
3:01 Who else actually thought he ate the raw chicken
S A U C E P N
Indian food never turns out better than the take out place (bc all good Indian food restaurants usually just have a bunch of desi grandmas cooking). It’s a universal law.
I wonder how long that piece of pepper will be stuck between the stove.
hi Babish love your show and to help you avoid cilantro try mixing lemon zest with dill and parsley, the smell is very close to it
Who eats rice with a fork?
try to use fenugreek next time in your spice blend! it's a flavour bomb!
One of my all time favorite dishes
That curry powder is actually called - " garam masala" here in India.Garam means hot and masala means any chilly powder.This looks really delicious.
Getting tired of the 5 minutes videos. I don't want excuses. I want entertainment. Scrumptious entertainment.

we used to call my sister Tikka Masala cuz she's weird like that
If anyone doesn't want to go through the trouble of acquiring and grinding spices, then at least buy curry paste instead of curry powder. Being kept moist preserves the flavors and aromas way better than dry powders.
Bro where is the tumeric
Hello babish try to use coconut milk instead of heavy cream it will make it delicious and you will be close to the original taste.
Can you do a Bascis episode of Thai curry?!?!?!
I don't think I've ever seen an Indian chef use sugar in a curry, but it seems very common for westernized recipes.

We tend to use onions to provide the sweet flavor.
Dude... the ginger....   hah!
Lol so I’m legit cooking this today
Please try and make the pastry’s from the end scene in fantastic beasts and where to find them!

Still waiting for a binging with babish and food wishes with chef John collaboration

How many people does this recipe feed?
Guys just 2k subs and we get another special
Use thighs everyone!! So much more tender and not overwhelming at all.
2:20 right hand bottom corner.
Chili is not optional.
Grandpa would be proud
I love your  Cooking
Babish you should do boot soup from ww2 as is a common Russian dish during Stalingrad maybe add a side of potato starch wallpaper soup as well
But did you give a bite to the queen?
Watching this while eating paneer butter masala on a bed of rice with coriander on top - literally looked like your plating set the end if mine wasn't meal prep. Gonna have to see how this curry powder compared to the ones in the UK Indian markets
I see that ginger there. 2:19
Dude, where is the turmeric....
I’m confused by the lack of turmeric? And I vehemently disagree about the choice of chicken. I think thighs would be more amazing in this context.
British national anthem intensifies
Made this for dinner tonight! Of course I forgot the chilis but substituted it with crushed red peppers. Hope that was okay Babish! Love the recipe!

This is a comment before I have watched the video. Can't wait for this one...
Sent to daughter to try with added instructions of don't grate ur fingers... As she puts it no meal complete unless it has grated finger tips... Good job she is mine and I love her :)
CONGRATS ON 4 MIL!!!
Sorry, the methods you used just aren’t the ones required to execute this dish properly. Good job on the garam masala though.
2:12 The spice must flow. He who controls the spice controls the universe...
Do next with fried chicken
UK National dish??
the uks national dish?
Hwhelming.
Oh my god he is the best Cook that i have ever seen
Finally a cooking video in this channel
Heyo that's no basic dish to cook!
“That’s how you get dead” hahahahahahahahahah omg.
i’m from the UK and still surprised how uncultured everyone is and we somehow make CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA like wtf lmao
What do you do with the rest of the curry powder?
No almond powder?
"The national dish of the UK"


Oh colonialism....
Is anyone else also triggered when he puts the plastic on things, to cool in the fridge, and it has a wrinkle!? 😩
And-roux
Freaking yes!
I wouldn't call it curry powder, I think it's more like... Garam masala powder? Considering the fact you actually don't use curry leaves when making this:/
Where were you 2 years ago when I was trying to find a concise, readable chicken tikka masala recipe?
Are those Vigor pots and pans?
One of your greatest videos yet!
Looks amazing
2:21 That ginger looks, very interesting.
Am I crazy, or is this a repost. I swear I’ve seen this video, but if it was just posted today?
LOVE THIS
Beautiful!
Saw it, made it, loved it
Is that a ginger root or are you just happy to see me?
Look Babby. I'm sure you're never gonna see this comment but Chef John made chicken tikka masala with chicken thighs and now I don't know what to do with my life. This is literally the most conflicted I've ever been, and now I need therapy. Bye.
Teach me daddy I mean babby
Congrats on 4 million!
There's no turmeric in the curry powder???
Learn from my mistakes. I used San marzanos instead of crushed tomatoes and my tikka ended up kind of pink. I also used cardamom pods instead of the seeds and it was overpowering.
A Babish chicken video? On my birthday? You are truly guided by some higher power.
Anyone gonna mention that was clearly a serrano pepper and not a bird's eye chili?
You forgot to give some to the queen :(
Babish there was a new hack I saw where I would use a fork to smash the garlic does this work?
Thats how you get dead
What is an acceptable substitute for bird's eye chili? I had to order seeds and am trying to grow them, but a 'close enough' pepper would be great in the meantime.
who did it better? ysac or babby
Why does he sounds like Bob from Bobs burgers
ysac did this
Andy, why no tumeric?
It's pretty funny how evolution is trying to kill off people by making them hate cilantro
I feel really sorry for the people who have this weird affliction that makes them spazzy about coriander. It's absolutely essential to get that authentic curry taste, and is super, SUPER tasty.
when you tell babish to make something and he does it
This recipe !!! Was just never expected from you Andrew. This is not even an amateur level thing. I am really taken aback by your shallow knowledge of the chicken tikka masala recipe. A friendly advise for future reference in Indian cuisine please follow @chefranveerbrar.
Make skinners steamed hams
I always have a pain in the ass time grating garlic, is there an easy way to grate a whole clove on a microplane without losing a fingernail or wasting half the garlic?
Im kidding dont do that,thats how you get DEAD
Ben 10 chilli fries
3:01 cursed_tastetest
Olive oil does not pair well with Indian spices. Mustard oil works best, but if not, then go for any other vegetable oil with neutral flavor profile. 

Second, chicken thigh is the piece of choice for tikkas although breast can work too. Using boneless thigh make the tikkas (tikka = piece) succulent, tender, and a whole lot juicier.
UK's national dish lollllllll 😂😂😂
I sneezed watching this
Whats up with the audio it seems louder and closer to my ears feels weird ...
Wow.... No Turmeric. What in the world?
My brother and I tried the recipe and it turned out great for a first attempt. We decided to add a bit of butter into the sauce at the end to thicken it. We think a bit less tomato would make it less sour (so that we don't have to add more sugar to balance out the acidity). You bet we're definitely going to give this another shot. Parents loved it.
You have to make the Hateful 8 stew!!!
As an Indian I prefer bread over rice.
Ah tikka masala authentic English food with an Indian influence
Mango lassie 🐕🥭🐶😂
my local Indian place is literally owned by people straight off the boat. THE best Indian food around here.
“that’s how you get dead”
Make a Reuben.
I should subscribe
I would love to see your take on Korma.
36 episodes too late
I love that squarespace has been providing babish with a new website for 2 years that he really loves.
Just made this. I've discovered I am really not a fan of cloves. I'll use 1/4th the amount of cloves the recipe calls for next time. Really sucks, cuz I can definitely taste what makes the dish so great. I know better for next time
Lassi is pronounced luhssi
My Indian mom is quaking
I didn't know I wanted this until I got it
you know youve made this right when you smell like curry from a mile away for a month straight
surprised you didn't use any butter. i usually use healthy amounts of butter
2:20 that ginger tho 😏😏😏
Do banging with babish
Excellent as usual.
That's how you get dead
Fun Fact: Variants of the word ginger exist in so many languages from portugese to korean, linguists are absolutely clueless to its origins.
Good to see you making some British food.
Completely murdered the recipe...yuck
Looks yummy! For the lactose-intolerant, I recommend using coconut milk in place of the cream for an even richer curry sauce. :-D
Please do red Thai curry. I have tried for years to get it right but I can never get it as creamy as at the  restaurant.
Adding oil to the water has no effect.
Ok you may help me out. What foil is it you using to cover up your bowl. I never saw these in germany.
“And there you go chicken Tikka Masala, just kidding don’t do that that’s how you get DEAD.” Why is that so funny to me??
I started marinading chicken tikka yesterday not seeing this video? And i butchered a whole chicken that was reduced via your instructions too!
Don’t do that. That’s how you get dead.
Coriander seeds aka soap seeds.
I’m so high rn I read “kitchen” not chicken
are you sick?
This is made wrong... kind of like how mcdonalds makes hamburgers
YSAC told me chicken tika masala is made by an Australian guy from Britain with freshly canned chicken, and freshly canned grinded spices, and served well with freshly canned pint of beer. Of course don't forget to give the first few spoon for the royalty
You did us Indians proud!!!
not bad, but my Ma makes it waaay better
where are the curry leaves???
Where's naan/roti?
very shocked and upset that you have not done a Scooby doo episode yet. 😭😭😭😭
Get ded
cant keep my eyes off the small piece of green pepper in the crack of the stove...
Go commit get dead
cilantro babies
Vichyssoise from Batman.
This looks amazing!! When i make tikka masala I skewer the chicken on 10inch skewers and lay them across a 9x13 pan to mimic a tandoori oven and bake it! It drips the fat and crisps beautifully!
If you can't cook this etc , you can always buy this at a good decent Indian Restaurant , this tastes good with white rice and pita bread.
Get ded
I don't even have a kitchen at the moment, why am I watching this
Where's the tomato soup? Fresh cream? Mango chutney? :/
any suggestions if you dont have a broiler option on your oven?
“Cilantro babies”
I love cilantro babies.
Heya,  question: could you shiw us some episodes incl. Red meat dishes that are NOT seasoned with Garlic?

I noticed that everytime i watch a Video about Cooking vy an american that includes any Red Meat, its Garlic.  Do Americans not know how to season without Garlic? Are they not interested to fibd out what other things work and hiw they taste?  

Im not going on about Garlic allergys ir something, i just Hate Garlic with a burning passuin (even though i dont mind the taste) and see it as the unskilled choice to give taste to something.  As soon as Garlic touches Food, it tastes like Garlic. Allways. Garlic is allways the dominant spice. 

So if you feel like it, i would love to see a video about alternatives to Garlic in dishes Americans usualy make with Garlic.

Best Regards!
Babish no that's not chicken Tikka seeing that white chicken I died little inside
turmeric has left the chat
Lovely dear chef
Chicken breasts? No way! It will be dry. Use boneless chicken thighs sauteed in ghee and the spices....that's far more authentic.
Ghee is the only way!! lots of it! you know the curry is done when theres a nice oily, spicy film on top
What is I don't have a spice grinder can I use mortar and pestle?
Do chocobars from yokai watch.
Looks tasty, but I want to slap the taste out of your mouth every time you say saucepan.
2:22 daz som nice ginger
2:22 WTF IS THAT GINGER
LOL BAAZMADI
"...The last thing you want to do when you're eating your curry is pull chunks of rock hard cloves out from your teeth."

Ironically, pulling out whole spices from your mouth and accidentally biting into a cardamom pod, clove or black peppercorn is part of the authentic South Asian curry-eating experience. Nothing like perfuming your mouth with a cardamom nuke
Where's the ghee? It's either go ghee or go home.
Now I now how to make that thing my mom makes
Alot of comments here saying it isn't "real", first of  all chicken tikka masala is a BRITISH dish that british Indians made, it's not meant to be a real chicken tandoori type curry, but rather something that is INSPIRED.
2:20 [ that_s_a_penis.gif ]
When I saw the title is Chicken Tikka Masala I thought he would put a seen from the movie RIPD in the beginning like he did for older videos. That would have been funny.
It is 80% of the real deal. So here are the TWO major mistakes. You forgot GHEE and TURMURIC powder. Traditionally they only use ghee as we call it clarified butter. Yes this is a UK dish but it was made by people of Indians origin. It's origin is in north Indian and Pakistani cooking traditions. I lived with an Indian for 3 years so I know as he can't stop bitching about it.
I actually made this for the first time a few days before this video and it was terribly heavy on the cinnamon. That flavor cut through everything else in the worst way, not even soapy cilantro could hide it.
Babish make Trinidad doubles
LOVE the fact that you said "naan" and not "naan bread" like everyone does! 💃
Pinch of salt
That intro song still annoys me, I can’t accept the random pause
“Chicken tikka masala tastes so good, when it’s in my mouth”
“It tastes so good like that” and something else I forgot
Sing in the tone of god save the queen
And yes this is a ysac reference

Boy...that was hard work...I do mine a bit different and it’s a rave with everyone who tastes it....but I am in the UK and don’t have an American accent...lol...
is no one gonna comment on how he pronounced tikka and korma? (i may be wrong because different countries might pronounce it differently, but it sounds funny to me)
Potato chips when?
Mango Lassi ❤️
OMG Yes
How many calories is this? huhu
thx babbo
And a pint of tiger
This is nice
Get dead
where is the tumeric poweder?
So hungry now
Is that Basmati rice?
Where's the turmeric, Steve?
The most time-saving trick I've discovered for peeling ginger is: don't. You can just not peel it at all. The peel won't hurt anything, especially if it's just going in the marinade anyway.
Seeing this is ep. 37 of Basics reminds me it would be really cool to do something from Kevin Smith films. Mooby's: Egga Mooby Muffin, Freedom Fries, Cow Tipper, all the Mooby's staples.
So where is the chicken?
Ah yes, I would hate to have to go to the doctors and be diagnosed with dead.
Suck on my tikka misala
This is an insult to Indian cuisine.
What's a Birdseye chili? What type of hot peppers can I substitute... Serrano?
Make turturkeykey from himym
Anyone lnow diffrence of tikka masala and garam masala
Is there anyway to sub out the tomatoes?
2:20
So it’s cool if I breath in the spice smoke right
make vindalu
Lol “that’s how you get dead”
A Basics episode? What's this?
I'm surprised that he even knows what korma is, but then again, he is a chef/cook/food maker...
Y YouTube been unsubscribing to people. I wondered y I wasn’t getting notifications.
The coffee grinder you use. Is it a burr grinder or a blade grinder? Or have you found it not to matter? Right now I use a pepper mill when I need to grind spices (generally peppercorns or coriander seeds).
please make some videos for ramadan dishes
Nice hiss...
Needs butter
1:45, why not just run them through a sifter when you take them out? Then you don't have to finger your spices.
It's not UK's it india's
Aren't you afraid of cutting chicken on a wooden cutting surface?
Does sugar really help or do anything for the acidity in tomato based dishes?
A (Sorry for bad Ukrainian)
No turmeric or garam masala?
The Chicken Tikka Masala was created in Glasgow, Scotland. A lot of salty Brit-hating Indians like to deny this fact but it is a fact nonetheless.
You’re missing the turmeric and the can of Heinz cream of tomato soup. Also without the Tandoor cooked chicken it just don’t taste the same.
I wanna Get dead
🤮🐆🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Babish vs Gordon Ramsey
Where did u get the idea for this video
Ab ye sikhaenge hume bc?
So you call the seeds of coriander 'coriander seeds' but then, for some weird reason, use the spanish translation cilantro for normal coriander. You silly americans lol :-b
I’m curious why turmeric isn’t in this. Never made curry without it!
Sup banish, here's a suggestion: peruvian cuisine. I personally believe it is one of the most underrated cuisine staples in the world. Also, love the vids- huge fan!
Enjoying the introduction of phallic ginger at 2:20
T h a t s  h o w  y o u  g e t  d e a d
Good to meet another cilantro-hater.
Korma!!
The ginger at 2:20 wants to get to know you better.
2:20 ginger looks weired😆😆😆
Can we get a bloopers with babish?
Hey if you’re considering future projects- how about the sumbitch cookies from how I met your mother?
That was a gingerdick.
I could smell this video.
I'm glad you said "share my affliction" at the end lol..  There are few things I dislike more than the nasty, perfumy, chemical rush I get up my nose whenever I taste a tiny pice of cilantro..
That’s how you get dead!
Owange Pranks anyone?
heres the thing tho is that some new ink on your right arm? i like that axe.
What an odd looking piece of ginger at 2:22. Wonder what it reminds me of…
400 subs away from 4 Mil, 😃I’m very excited!
Where's the tumeric? Where's the laal mirch? Brooooo this isn't real chicken tikka masala
make sim food
Chicken Tikka Masala, National dish of the United Kingdom, Another thing they stole from India.
yeaa, Babsish Indian take
This is one I actually want to try.  I don't have a spice grinder though, may get one if I really want to make it.  Also would cut out all the spiciness since I'm a wuss when it comes to that.
Congrats on 4 mil
But I wanna know how to grate things when it gets too close to my fingers to grate...
What's the brown people's opinion of this version of chicken tikka masala?
Hey Babish, just wanted to let you know, you inspired me to actually cook. Admittingly, I'm a mid 20s guy that never had the will to really cook anything, (just used to eating out or frozen stuff), but after seeing a bunch of your videos, I've actually started cooking! I made my first burgers yesterday with my own recipe, and it turned out awesome! Thank you good Sir.
Tip: trade in the heavy cream for some coconut milk. It will elevate the curry to a whole other level.
Why do i wacth this at night now i want curry
If Americans call coriander cilantro, why don't they call coriander seeds cilantro seeds?
UK, really?
Indian food 😍😍😍
Who else hates that the theme song has that little cut in it.
Great Look! Keep it going! Mucho-Love-O
Calzone from we bare bears
It's pronounced "lussi" btw. Saying "lassi" is kinda cringy
You could make a basics indian sides, and make Mango lassi, raita, papadums, homemage mango chutney and samosas
ghee bro
Dont do that, thats how you get dead!
Congrats on 4 mil!!!!!!
Babish, why do you hesitate to recommend boneless skinless chicken breasts? Definitely one of the most affordable
Really? It’s not Indian without masala powder man,
Wheres ownage pranks?
the tinned tomatoes don't need any more white sucrose use a carrot to off set the acididty
In the marinade, you can use Mustard oil instead of Olive. Tikka masala is an Indian dish and olive oil isn't used in Indian cooking.
That ginger root at 2:21 was not by accident, Mr. Rhea.
But does it come with a pint and cost only £4.99 before 6 PM?
The ginger at the being looks like a ding dong
Can somebody link me to the video where he talks about baking basmati rice?
The UK's national dish it seems 😒 ughh the colonialism.
Yooo somebody hit 4 million
babish is a direct cause to my obesity, "im unsubbing for my health"
You should do a new channel called "cocktails with babish"
Gimme dat!
Needs tumeric for the orange color??? Also I still think chicken thighs are better than breast in this situation.
I LOVE Tikka Masala, but I’m allergic to cardamom. Is there a spice I can use instead? Or maybe more of one of the other spices?
Who else is Pakistani and making sure he doesn't miss a thing?
Aye baby making Indian dishes is so nice thanks babyyy
2:20 he made a ginger genitalia
i am wondering.....all tikka masala i have ever seem were made with tumeric in it. kinda surprised you didnt add any to yours
Dude, for how long is your site "all new"? It's like those words you see on toothpaste or schampoo "NEW FORMULA" - which at one point surely was true but now, half a century later, might not be considered "new"
Ghee
The uk reference was from YSAC???
that ginger looks like something i know... hmmmmm
Am I the only one that got anxiety while he was breaking the cinnamon that the rest of the spices were going to burn?
Happy 4 Million!!
His voice is like cgp grey
No No NO! I would let those Brits take this away from us Indians, This recipe cannot be complete without mentioning India in it. It may be UK's National Dish the roots are 100% Indian.
What is a broiler???
I thought curry was a spice on its own... I had no idea that it's a mixture of a bunch of spices 🤯
What a pity you didn't use cashew paste.
Mmmmmmm chicken
What is the difference between butter chicken and tikka masala?
Isn't this an American-ized bastard take on just Tikka?
Where is butter?
Babish FINALLY makes Indian? I am here for it.
This has origin in india and a national dish of uk so proud
I’m going to be late for school because I’m watching this
Subscribed just for SCENTS of humor....
If you do naan and samosa you will be my new and forever favorite person.
south asian food doesn't always ask for salt AND pepper to balance the taste... salt and sugar is better for balancing as pepper will make the already spicy food taste stronger... also, try a squeeze of lime (not lemon!!!)
How is this basic?
if you don't go to a big grocery store that carries fresh green thai birds eye chilies you can substitute with a serrano. it's not as spicy either, if you don't want it to be as hot. if ya want to heat it back up without changing the flavors much cyan powder in the yogurt marinade would work, although that might change the color some.
Can you make homemade Pepsi. It was in an episode of the simpsons
There is a real epiphany when you toast and grind your spices. Steven Heap and Dan Tombs are two great YouTube channels for Indian dishes. I like cilantro--it is not saponific for me, but it is not a craving. It is like lactose in that I can have a couple of spoons of ice cream but not a whole scoop. It is like that hot exchange student that you like to be around, but are afraid to date.
The biggest sin made in this video is not using ghee
tikka masala has garam masal, coriander ground and cumin ground and turmeric, garlic, ginger, fried onions, don't put back pepper in there lol.. use kashmiri chili or cayenne, but use carefully
Thank you Babish for making me love cooking. Such a invaluable skill to know that’s not taught as much anymore sadly :/
Garam masala?
If you can, get hold of a stone grinder for spices, they grind mechanically with stones that keep the spices cool. Coffee grinders generate a lot of heat and the spice loses flavour in the process. Stone grinders are hard to come by but they are worth it.
I was just wondering... Why don't you have a "Clean Plate Club" playlist? And we're is the second part of the Forest Gump episode?
Make the kanker sisters burger from Ed, Edd, and Eddy!
No sugar
Ps 100% of paedophiles neglect the cilantro
In future curries try to get ghee (indian clarified butter) it has a kinda funky flavour but when cooked in properly, use instead of oil for frying onions, or if doing a curry where the meat is used as a base for the best fond you will ever taste as the spice mix is already cooked in.
OH DUUDE fresh butter naan or even..stuffed paneer kulchas with tikka masala. Id lose the korma personally but yes the mango lassi will help digest the meaty flavorful heaven your stomach is trying to comprehend. Also try out making Dum biryani! cause honestly i want to see a person not put whole spices in my rice dish...fricking cinnamon sticks
can someone inform me the legend of the tiny whisk?
That does not look like a spicy patty. Thanks for trying a thing.
Indian dish in america
So I just want to talk a little bit about...
It's Indian Dish not UK's!

Please Babish
I live in a small town in California where most of the population if from east India. The Indian food here is so delicious! Theres even an annual Sikh parade where there give out massive amounts of free Indian cuisine. Indian food is a staple here, I love it. This chicken tikka looked great :)
You should do John Coffey’s last meal from The Green Mile, it’s meat loaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, fried okra, and cornbread
The Indian restaurant in town that makes the best Chicken Tikka Masala adds ketchup to their sauce o:
When babish said "don't believe me" i was hoping for a Rasheed cameo
A British dish as Article 13 passes the end of YouTube
now do Chana Masala
You should do a spoof video on medium rare chicken! You rock, Andrew!!
As an Indian, this curry recipe is heresy.
Pewdiepie: this is chickening me out
Is there an alternative to broiling if you don't own an oven?
Just out here, trying to get d e a d.
How much money would allow you to free yourself up from the square space advertiseing? Honestly looking into starting a YouTube production company and am trying to find some clients to pick there brain about possibilities.
Next up- tubby custard!
Gloves? Do you live in a backwater country?
I disagree the UKs national dish is Curry over Chips. Why I don't know, its bloody disgusting, but they seem to like it.
Wondering about a non-meat protein sub. Tofu (with way less marinating time)? Seitan? Don't hate me.
I need hell
Tikka masala is the most popular dish in the UK but it's not the national dish, fish and chips is the national dish
That ginger looked like a pee pee
Is this an Indian dish?
I’ve never been more stoked to see a video of something I’ve already done! I make chicken tikka masala with almost the exact same recipe, except I grill the chicken and use store bought garam masala. Good to see I’ve been doing something to Babish standards all along.
“Basics” would be buying curry at the grocery. This is more like “Making things unnecessarily complicated with babish”.  But yeah, i kid, its right down to basics. Missing part would be to make heavy cream from fresh cows milk. But yeah, only do it from the “basics” when only you can show off and when its convenient.
4 mil!
Could you make the foods from The Dragon prince?
I'm telling chef John dude. As you are the .
FINALLY! Thanks Babish!!! <3 <3
Babish, keeping with the curry theme, could you do a chicken madras recipe please? It is impossible to find one out there that doesn't involve base gravy or mix powder
I get scolded for pronouncing lassi incorrectly, and I feel the need push the scolding onto someone else for a change!
Ahhh another Steve MRE reference :D
i was expecting a bad attempt at a british accent and opening literally all of the ingredients in a can

You should probably update the ad, the difference in mic quality is deadly obvious

“That’s how you get dead” -Babish
This vid was sexy
Personal tip: Using the same marinade, marinade some chicken thighs and just make them in an oven or fry them or any way you want. Serve with rice, fries, mash, I don't care. Really tasty, used to do it all the time at college, and the flavorful chicken meat in no way detracts from the experience. It's a whole different dish tho, so no contest to this one. Just something to think about if you do this and get leftover marinade.
At least you got it right calling it a UK based creation
Y de repente PUM, un comentario en español :D
Naan
* eats and enjoys *
HOW DID HE KNOW
It's always about the cardamom, where's the cardadad in all this?
Any tips for making a paneer version of this?
Weed Smokers!! Peep Out The DANK Content! :D
Flavors didn't get to know each other.
if you have a grill, I can recommend cooking the chicken over coals/fire until half black
Ah the very old and very famous British Chicken Tikka Masala . I see you calling out "You Suck at Cooking".
YSAC approves LOL
It's a nutmeg seed Babish :)
OMG I died when he said that's how you get dead
Why do no youtube chefs ever properly caramelize onions at the base of a curry? As is customary in Indian cuisine to give depth of flavour.
For some reason I started this video while I had a massive splooge explosion on my chest
* Gasp! * Mango lassi?! How dare. Rose lassi is where it's at. ... Of course, I kid.  Mango lassi is amazing, too, but so is salty lassi.  Oh, if you're going to do more Indian food, what about Indian snacks like burfi and bhakarwadi?
Awwwww yiss!
my indian ass was getting ready to square up but then i sent this to my mom and she was like "......how did this nice white man find my recipe" so congrats! she's going to adopt u
Eyeyey what happend with Your black glows
Cilantro soap?? What?? Taste buds broken or what? It's delicious and it makes any dish smell and taste fresh but of course don't overdo it. 

What did you say it's toxic? Whole India must be dead by now if that was true. Gotta look it up.
add turmeric or you will get dead
4 mil
I like to use unpeeled, frozen ginger, shaved across the grain into my curry.
"That's how you get dead." 🤣😂
Mr. Babish! Just want to congratulate you on your success! I remember I discovered your channel a couple years ago on Facebook and the moment I did, I binge watched every single episode in one night.
You had to name all the other stuff we love...great, now I have to dirty a lot of pans...
Question: What if you added in lemon zest and lemon juice into the yougurt and then marinated the chicken?
Need that Mango Lassi episode!
that rice be wetter than my hair after a shower
'That's how you get dead'.
loved that Steve1989 reference
Very educational gonna try this and cook for my family
How come you are missing like 90% of the ingredients ?
As stated by the laws of the United kingdom of England you have to give a bite to the queen before you eat a national dish.
When banish said to eat the marinated chicken(before cooking) I paused the vid and chowed down a bit(didn't like it) then out of curiosity I played the vid and heard him say jk don't do that that's how you die! Needless to say I Fucked Up!😭 🤢
Now all I need is a nice Chianti
Can you make food from fortnite🍔🍕
Why no Turmeric? Using standard ginger is like using yukon gold Potatoes in a Sweet Potato Pie.
Im not American .... whats a broiler ?  A fan oven ?
I’m from England, I get the impression that curry isn’t that big in America, is that that the case?
how would this be with tofu?
Happy 4 million!
Do the pink cupcakes from cat in the hat
I LOVE this recipe, been craving it for awhile, was gonna make it but then kind of got lazy. Thanks for making this!
Could you please do the “welcome home Cake” from coralline or the whole buffet dinner scene 😍
"UK's national dish"... LOL
"That's how you get dead" lol
Thought you had a storm breaker tattoo x-D
2:21 
That ginger on the right is making me uncomfortable
You should make Turkari molee it's like my favourite curry ever.
I dont know man, my boy mandeep from my local Raj makes a peng Tikka Masala
Boy that is one unfortunately shaped ginger root
Babish, I love all your videos, but all your music so far has been.... hideous
All I could think about while watching this was that black mirror episode where they were dating people and they said the best part about the date was Chicken Tikka Masala! 😂
He did it! He's finally making curry!
I love how you think this is a common dish. I've never heard of it.
Love all your steve1989mre references!
More Indian food, please!
Aw man, you gotta find and try the recipe for naan from 'The Essential Madhur Jaffrey', it's the bomb and it's written well enough for even white people like me to make a cracking naan at home using the grill of my oven.
What is cilantro?
Title should read "The first ginger Briss."
I thought it said Malasada.
Spoiler alert: Dude spent a lot of time and effort making garam masala. Just buy garam masala.
"That's how you get dead."
reads title "OH HELL YES!"
Cilantro babies. I live it!
Pretty sure you should use ghee, not olive oil.
Do Kafteji ( a Tunisian hot and spicy dish) i can send you the perfect recipe from my city!!
Chicken Tikka Masala for the UK, invented in Glasgow where it is claimed that rather than adding tomatoes, the chef added a can of tomato soup.
If you can find mustard oil, that would enhance the flavor of the spices, try it!
I remember when you had 300k
What are the odds of me wanting to make Tikka Masala myself , then a Basics with Babish comes out the same day
saucepin @3:40  !
most my fellow indians just use the pre packaged  spices, taste just as good if not better lmao
I've been thinking about this dish for a long time, I don't know why
please teach us how to make good rice
4:43 ruined the dish right there :(
try making homemade bratwurst
Bro thats indian food
For some reason, the people in my country are babies who can barely handle the heat of a bellpepper, so it's really hard to get my hands on decent hot peppers. Even food that is supposed to be spicy is reworked to suit the delicate palate of the average person, so food in Indian restaurants is really mild. Luckily, I recently found a guy who sells a bunch of pepper varieties including Habaneros. I think I'll try this recipe, switching out the Bird's eye pepper for a Habanero.
Whoa, it's interesting because for past 2 days I've been looking into Indian food, and here you go releasing this video. Does google give you my search history. This video is clearly made for me.
Buying the ingredients to make this dish once must be quite a quest.
Can you do a vid on either Potato’s or Seafood Au Gratin? It’s a royal pain to make but delicious as hell

Is there any way to make this without the ability to smell? I love chicken tikka masala!
Gorgeous. Thank you
You're supposed to offer the first bite to the Queen! It's tradition!
Amazing, truly.
Nacho sombrero from Despicable Me
Fresh coriander (cilantro) is gross and soapy, but the spice jar type makes any Indian or Mexican dish. Coconut is another food kryptonite, but anything except Italian food can be improved by the addition of Paprika. 

But equally I don't like lots of pepper because my family's grinder once popped open leading to peppercorn stew.
powdery powder
Wheres your teal watch? It's amazing to look at. What make and model is it?
where the homemade naan??
have a laugh have a pint and have a good time
Speaking as an Indian, this dish is always fascinating to me. I am aware it is related to chicken tikka, in the same way that I am aware the tiny rodent like hyrax is actually more closely related to the elephant than anything else. But, just like it that case, how one turned into the other is a little bewildering to me.
Make sushi Babish!
Remember the last time someone made this? He sucks at cooking and he basically made it and put on a British accent, a damn fine video, plus you forgot to let the queen have a first bite
What is the difference between Kosher Salt and Salt
Finally it's nice to see an INDIAN curry in your channel
Does curry not use curry leaf?
Better with some turmeric I would say. But a very good English Indian curry! 👍
You should try cooking something from the Food Wars anime
"Thats how you get dead" killed me
oooo u should do a recipe from black butler, Sebastian stylee ;)
just kidding, don't do that. that's how you get ded..
You ever thought about white cake from Django
Damn dude, over 100k in less than a day
Chicken Spinach curry next?
Not even a single attempt at a British accent? YSAC did it better.
>Chicken thighs would be overwhelming in a Tikka Masala


That's where you're wrong, bub.
Nice try Babi, but I've already watched You Suck at Cooking make this. So I'm already a pro!
I did not at all notice the interesting shape of the ginger root.
Just remember to eat raw chicken if you want the dead
how long is it going to be ''new'' website...
More Indian stuff!!!
Chicken tenderloins go pretty good for this instead of the breasts or thighs.  I also like to do my sauce with about a teaspoon of smoked paprika, your mileage may vary.

Ooh, while I'm thinking about it, most Indian grocers will probably have big jars of garlic & ginger paste.  If you don't feel like spending a lot of time with a microplane or grater on your garlic and ginger, that's a very convenient way to achieve it, not as customize-able but it keeps forever in the fridge and is super useful for lots of other things, I tend to use it in my a few pseudo-chinese sauces when I'm stir frying veggies in the wok, about a tablespoon of that with some soy and hoison in a squeeze bottle, shake to combine and squirt out to your taste.
There are 6 Indian take outs near my place
Replace the chicken with paneer, and you have a vegetarian dish :D
Maybe this is a dumb question, but is thrre any reason you didn't use tumeric in your curry powder?
Sorry but Tumbs Down.. You might ask why? The essential ingredient in Chicken Tikka Masala is FenuGreek and you did not put any! I am not even freaking out about you not putting any Tumeric!
Where was the can of ale


YSAC lied to me. Darn who would've thought
Goosebumps every time that intro music plays <3
Not super authentic but still great recipe !
Haven’t any of the video chefs discovered jarred ginger garlic paste?
"One nut..." Thats how i like it Babish nice and nutty
Somosas basics????
Is it really "Basics" if you start out with 8 spices, half of them are hard to find?
2:21 we see that!
i don't get this, you go out of your way to make fresh curry powder, and then tomato tins + tomato paste are your option for the tomato? lol
Babish, you've got it very wrong
This might be like three million months late but do you remember when you were on buzzfeed video in L.A?
thats how you get dead
This is basically the same recipie that I’ve been using for forever, except I like my tikka masala to have A LOT of punch, so I put like twice the amount of spices than you did in the marinade, and instead of cream for the sauce, I use yogurt and a little bit of half and half
On St Patty’s day I was making corn beef and cabbage and looked to your channel to find a video about it and there was nothing! I know this has nothing to do with this video but I was like wtf dude you tend to do some holiday thingys
I love indian food
i would love to see your rendition of bibimbap! that's a korean basic for sure c:
What happend to the nutmeg please help.
I like cilantro babies
4 million subs up in here
Am I the only one who noticed that the ginger lying on the table at 2:21 looked like a pen*s?
As a brown person whose mom makes desi food professionally, I approve of this recipe!
0:12 ir says episode 37. below the video it says Basics with Babish S2 • E22

wtf man
you have a respectable knowledge of British culture for a yank peepshow is dead niche but also one the most important bits of sitcom ever.
BwB, It's Alive and Epicurious all uploaded at the same time. I guess you guys decided I don't deserve to graduate.
Andrew, you forgot your little introduction about what you're doing and went straight to the intro and cooking.
Cardamom seeds or pods?  Black, or green?
Hey Andrew,
I would like to make a suggestion
Instead of using chilli flakes you could use dried Kashmiri chillies. They aren't as hot and have a rich aroma and beg you pardon but that's where we get the colour from(with the addition of cream ofcourse)
Where's the love for West Indian cuisine? I think you'd kill it
I personally don't use as much cream and add in paprika, kashmiri chili powder for color and fenugreek leaves for a bit of herbal flavor
Needs cashew paste and tumeric
Just finished making tikka curry and this pops in to my notifications. Are you spying on me? 😂
OKAY BABISH PLEASE DO BUTTER CHICKEN!!!!! I’ve had it every year for my birthday for 13 years and i love it!!!
Alrighty then dollar store Alton brown

WTF!!! how come Chicken tikka masala being a famous indian dish be UK' national dish!!
How do you avoid your pan turning black? Happens every time i use my stainless steel pan

mmmmm Yummy :) i love curry

There's no way you didn't arrange that ginger like that on purpose.
Do an authentic mole next. Handle over 30 plus ingredients, I dare you.
WHAT FILM DOES HE USE FOR COVERING THE CHICKEN PLS SOMEBODY
Hey babish, could you do a vegan episode of basics with babish

The way he said lassi 😂😂😂
In my opinion, we need a Binging with Babish and Life of Boris collab. You two have some overlapping content subjects, but two very different ways of going about the cooking process.
I mean it looks like a fantastic recipe, but remember when this show was for basics?
youre doing indo pak food wow
Love from India ❤️
You forgot to give the first bite to the Queen
You just threw olive oil on the boiling water for nothing (oil and water don't mix and when your rice is done cooking you just throw the water and oil out). You just wasted oil there.
No tumeric?
That’s how you get dead
Now I’m really hungry, thanks!
wow look at that ginger at 2:20
How many episodes of Basic do we have to go through before the website isn’t new anymore?

A nice tip is to keep your ginger in the freezer then you can grate it skin on and it breaks down during cooking and you can't taste it (honest) Also most of any roots nutrients are in the skin so you're adding loads more goodness as well as saving time (and your ginger lasts forever)
I was just looking for this recipie! Can you make a french onion soup video?!?!
Saucepin
Just a question for you.. did you grate the whole nutmeg into that ground spice mix?
goes to comments just to see upset Indians and Pakistanis 
T U R M E R I C MY GUY.
Not authentic Indian but i guess very close to the original recipe...
If you tried to serve this in the UK you'd get thrown into the sea. No. Just no.
Can I substitute the curry powder with curry paste?

Can coconut milk or cream be used for a non dairy version?
Try cinnamon instead of cassia next time?
kulfi!
Olive Oil is an abomination to this dish. Should've used butter.
Skip the black pepper in the marinade and add red pepper. Chicken tikka wouldn’t be chicken tikka without some Kashmiri red chili powder but any chilli powder would do.

Hey babish, when you were curing the turkey, you could've submerged the whole thing in a tub of water (leave the ziplock thing above the water) to get rid of all the air. It's much easier and it's way more accurate.
Woah, I actually just finished parks and rec on Netflix, my favorite show of all time now
Your future self will appreciate the favor even more if you roast the carcass before throwing it in the stock pot. The roasting brings some caramelization (yay Maillard effect) and improved flavor when you make stock.
What's the difference between a cure and a brine?? Anyone know??
OMG you should do apple pie and make your own cool wHip from family guy (:

I’ve been watching since the first season and I am sorry to say that this is my first comment. This episode was fantastic!  Maybe it’s because I’m under the weather but the dry humor of your impersonations really made me happy. Plus, the quick reference to Chris Traeger was perfect. Thank you for being so awesome!

Cover more about Global Warming; like the fact that food shortages and water shortages are already on the rise, extreme conditions have guaranteed crop shortages, contaminated food and water, increase costs to food, and extreme droughts, record-breaking wild fires and rising coastlines. Mass immigration of refugees are happening largely in part thanks to Climate change and conflicts (usually) inspired by gas and oil industries (case in point; Venezuela and the US backed Coup...)



And what's most frustrating is that green renewable energy plans are out there, and are affordable, and will do infinitely more help to communities, health and the future of our economy.
 Acting Now will save billions of lives and prevent economic collapse.


Please,  use your influence to spread the message. We are not powerless. In eleven years time, if we don't take action as a human species, there will not be a human species within the next century.

Hey Babish, awesome vid as usual! Why the pink salt though? As a practiced charcuterie chef, I don't see the benefit, only the adverse health risks. Why not a traditional brine, and why not add some aromatics to the solution?

Yooo you should make the foods from total drama action I think its episode 3 or 2where they make a bunch of nasty food.

eating like a king in 2019, cheers!
Let Steve know that he doesn't need to soak his wood. It'd doesn't accomplish anything - if your wood burns up, add more wood. Simple.


What it does actually do is add water vapor/steam, and for smoking things where you will be doing it for a while to get a smoked "bark," you want as little moisture as possible.
I thought I never see the day
Imagine not washing the meat🤢
If you need a turkey I can send you a freshly butchered one year round
Do the frozen banana from arrested development !
Good job....
I have cried twice in my life. Once when I was seven, and was hit by a school bus. And when I found out that little sabastion has died. - Ron Swanson

MAKE SURE the turkey is thawed when you try to carve it.  I learned that the hard way.  Such a pain to try it with a half thawed animal.
Smoked turkey legs at amusement parks are made from bigger male turkeys; this is a standard grocery store female turkey.

Sorry to be that guy, but it's good information: Soaking wood chips just produces steam. The smoking point of wood is higher than the boiling point of water, and good "clean" smoke is higher than that.
haven’t watched in a minute. glad that I decided to tune in today
I feel hungry and I just ate

Go babby go! I love your videos so much.
A little tip for curing (brining) your bird parts in a plastic bag. Instead of a zip-lock bag, use a regular bag with a twist tie. You can get more air out, and do it easier, with that kind of bag.
If I wasn't already having wet dreams after watching Binging with Babish, now I am.
I love you
Turf and Turf?
Babish, Do Dagwood next.
It's March, I just made a turkey dinner the other day because the store had turkey.

barbaric. a murdered bird.

Turkey burgers? Pfft, don't be silly, Babish. The meat, bun, and done (with ketchup, if you'd want it) will always be the superior option; it's not even a contest at this point.
Have you considered making pies from Pushing Daisies?
wait so how does disney get turkey legs?

Make some food from monster hunter world or make the sandvitch from tf2
Alright Freddy Spaghetti
My hunting buddy uses bacon wrapping on his deer roasts not only to help the flavor be less wild but also to add some fat because wild game is so lean.He also swears by using Maxwell House Freeze dried instant coffee to accomplish the same thing.That wild taste can be off putting.
Please dont change the format of Being with Babish.. so far it felt so laid back and goofy and I dont want it to change just because the episodes are gonna multiply. Just my wants lol

Hey everyone. Thank you all SO MUCH for all the kind words and comments. I feel absolutely blessed to have been involved in this inaugural episode of what is (I am positive) going to be a series of incredible feels trips. 

Honestly, If I had just made quiche and hung out with Andrew for an afternoon it would have been so uplifting. What he and his team (Incl. Sawyer and Vinny/Vincenzo) did for me still seems unreal. I get up every day to see if the Vespa is parked outside. I am typing this comment on the MacBook sitting with my best friend @AntVenom in an AirBNB after spending the past 2 days at Disney and NASA. My life has improved dramatically. I have hope again.

The internet truly is a community. Please continue to have hope for humanity. It's really not as bad out here as people think, even during hardships. Good people exist. If you ever need reminding: come back to this video. The BwB team deserves your love, views and accolades. I am so excited for the future of this show! <3

P.S. answering questions on Reddit for a bit.
I already respected you, but holy shit, Babs, you are amazing. You're like a cooking...bald...angel man.
ANGEL MAN!
It's amazing seeing YouTubers this big give back to the community. Being human and humble really makes me like Babish even more.

I only wrote this to make my tears go away.
Not gonna lie, I was crying when Mr. Wasman received all of his well deserved gifts, but I was BAWLING when you signed off with "keep cooking, I will if you will."
putting ant venom in this video just gave 17 year old me like 12 year old flashbacks, jesus christ i was not prepared
imagine dumping babish.. that's a big loss right there
Babish taking care David's heart medication was the real tear-jerker for me. I have a health condition that made me have to take med for life, and yeah, at times when you're not financially capable, just not being able to buy your medicine for next month could literally drag your whole world down to the black hole. Thank you B, and just for keep hanging on there, thank you David. :)

Babish is like Saitama from one punch man. In only 3 years of training he achieved ultimate power and lost his hair.
I discovered you about an hour ago. Now I have to go show this video to every person I know. Truly life-changing.
Here from Jenna and Julien podcast, I’m so glad. I had no idea of this golden content I was missing out on!!!
They need more youtubers like you. So humble. It’s really inspirational. More Andrew less Paul brothers
Came to your channel after a... good couple months of not watching your videos. 
Been through a breakup, we used to binge watch your videos together, so it was kind of hard for me to get back here. 
So anyways, I came here tonight for a recipe... stayed for the feels. 


You, Andrew, are one of these few little things in life that make life this tiny bit better. 
Thank you.
this guy is unreal lol

Whenever someone is in a hole they cant get out of. All they need is a helping hand. And you babbish are that helping hand. Changing people's outlooks on things. Helping and making people happy every day by either cooking, inspiring, or just being seen by someone. Keep doing this man. Love what you do. And you helped me learn some cooking tips too.
God I had no idea that the man who built that masterpiece of my childhood was so great.
You really made this guy's day! Great job man!
Not all heroes wear capes, some wear aprons.
I didn't think I would like this vlog stuff but I'm so glad that I bit the bullet and gave it a go. This is nice. It's simple and not over hyped. It feels sincere so I will definitely follow this as well as BWB.
Would you look at these magnificent beards?!?! And the chrome domes. :-D And Dave is a sweet guy!
Man... when talent and drive and inevitable success turns into the privilege/ability of being able to share it with others.. great stuff Andrew. I just found your work and its great.
Ps you're piss funny when most wont know you're piss funny.
Next episode, that looks like the interior of Signature at MGM Grand in Vegas...
Binging with babish : food for your belly

Omg! I love this!!! 

Yaaas Babish, spread them good vibes!

Also, i wanna know who has thumbs down this!?!?!

Andrew Rea you are officially my god-damned hero.
Normies: omg Ellen you didn’t 

Intellectuals: omg Babish you didn’t
Who is cutting onions! God damn it, Babish!
I'm glad it ended on that scooter shop bit, because I was crying  most of the episode.
Andrew... dang it man.. you got me teary eyed.

Bless you for being so amazing. For this..and more.
That was a twist seeing hankvenom
Tbh I didn’t know he could survive outside of a kitchen
I live for this content. Creators giving back is/always will be my favorite content to ingest.
Thank you for this.
You should keep him on the show
I've always loved watching your videos, but this one is by far my favourite. You sir are a fucking legend!

So many youtubers get as popular as you are and lose sight of their fans, it's great to see you truly care about your fans.
You would have to be a special kinda dumb to dump an angel like babish
Queer Eye: we're gonna help people

Babish: hold my quiche
Wait a minute.....

Man I got to admit, I'm pretty into this whole God's plan era you are setting, pretty cool man.
Btw, do you help fans overseas?
"remember to keep cooking. i will if you will" 
that really pulled at my heart strings and inspired me
Andrew, you are an amazing human being. Keep doing what you're doing and spreading food, love, and compassion. The world needs more people like you. Bless!
Andrew, this is beyond sweet. I was a bit skeptical about you taking the vlogging route, but the benevolence and sincerity displayed in this video got rid of any doubts. Please keep doing what you do. You're one of the best there is.
This is the coolest thing ever! I love how your are giving back positivity to the fans that have shown you positivity. When you put good out in the universe it comes back to you. I hope it comes back 10 fold for you! Keep up the awesome work.
Andrew i have to thank you, watching your shows always makes me happy. As a fellow chef i appreciate your art, and as a viewer i appreciate your heart. You're amazing, thank you for all you do.
I find myself coming back to this episode again and again since it was posted last week. Beautiful food, beautiful company, and beautiful gestures.
Anyone who disliked this has a cold heart.
Babish, this is single handedly the most heart warming tale of 2 bald brothers I’ve ever seen.
There are too many emotional things about this episode to get into without compromising myself so instead I am going to sit here and admire David's excellent mustache.
Literally sobbing watching this. Great to see! David keep being amazing and Andrew I can't wait to see your next episode! :)
OH Babish I cried <3. This was such a beautiful and amazing first episode of this show. You are an amazing human being
"Oh I wonder what Babby cooked up for me this time?" leaves crying
even on the back of a scooter, Babish is a badass, you are absolutely incredible sir and i hope you get to keep doing this for many years to come
I’m here from the Jenna and Julien podcast.
If ever there was proof you and your community do so much for so many, this was it. Kudos to all of you.
This is an amazing story. I could only imagine how great you must’ve felt helping that great man. That’s man of the year type ish right there. Respect!!
Me: Holy crap I might not cry this is 
Babish: This is an annual pass to Disney 
Me: sobbing
Oh my gosh, this was so much more amazing than I expected! My heart is warm. Thanks for being an amazing man ♥️
Dude, His mustache is just amazing... He is a legend at keeping that thing thing clean!
I’m not crying you’re crying 😭

Also just wow Andrew I’m literally blown away by this....❤️
My cheeks hurt from smiling so much all through this video <3
Florida man sends szeshuan sauce to babish in ikea tupperware
He is such a genuine person! This is the first video I've in a while that made me genuinely happy. You're an awesome guy and content creator Andrew. You've helped a lot of people through tough times. (Including me.) Keep up the great work.
Good on you dude! I admire your heart and willingness to give back to people. Keep it up man.
I love this new series! Seeing good people get good things is so rewarding, thank you for spreading your wealth around, be that financial or otherwise. I can't wait to see more from this series!
Andrew, I've seen a few of your videos before, just dabbling but this, THIS gives me the feels! Subscribed!!
the real question is... who would break Andrew's heart ?
HEY Vsauce! Michael here! Did you know I could COOK?... But what is... Cooking? 🤨
music plays
Holy shit! There are many videos where YouTubers give things to fans but nothing I've seen is so fulfilling and pure out of heart. Andrew you are a gem and so is the community you are building. Thank you my man!
I'm not one to watch this kind of thing because it hits me in all of my anxiety places, but, I basically cried. This was so heartwarming. As someone going through life, this second-hand made everything ok. Can't wait for more!!!
Dude by far are you one of the coolest youtuber ever! Keep up the good work man!
Been subbed to Babish for around 2 1/2 years and he really does deserve way more than 3.9m subs. Easily one of the most wholesome and most creative YouTubers on the platform
Just now getting to watch this episode after a loooong trying week of Nursing School. This is amazing! You're amazing! David is amazing! You are an inspiration, and I have been watching you since the beginning. Thank you for pushing through your own hardships and making things that people love. Andrew, thank you, for making this mans life. And thank you for making my days better one video at a time! Have a wonderful day.
I don’t usually cry after watching emotional stuff, but this brought tears to my eyes. The genuine gratitude on that guy’s face was so moving. 

Also, side note, why would anyone break up with Andrew?! I would say yes to a date with him in a heartbeat.
You are amazing. 'Nuff said.
Also, great to see people helping other people, just thinking of other people, in any way. We need more of this right here!
Welcome back to Bawling with Babish
I never knew when I first stumbled upon one of these cooking videos, hungry but too lazy to actually cook, that I would end up sitting in front of my computer screen holding back tears. You are truly a beautiful human being, the world needs more people like you. Please keep being the best version of yourself, don't let anyone ever change who you are. Being with Babish is my new favorite series on YouTube.
Awwww guys look what Babish and us have created! I'm so proud of Andrew(๑>◡<๑)
First of all, this was brilliant. Everything about it was so good! Secondly... VINNY!
This made my whole day man you’re the best. Keep being awesome man!
-10pts for not giving us the quiche recipe.
+50billion pts for everything else.
Being with Babish? More like BAWLING With Babish. God damn this got me right in the feels. Bravo sir <3
That's how it's done Mr. Rea, that's how it's done. Very glad to be a fan and a subscriber since your early days. Good things! Salaams and blessings from Kenya🇰🇪😎!
As if the world couldn't love Andrew Babish more.  This was awesome.
You are such a rad dude! I always thought you were incredible but this is a new level of pure kindness. Keep being awesome, and I look forward to seeing more of this! Love ya, man!
Oh my god give this man his own show on TV right now. He's too good for the Youtube Red bullshit.  This video alone shows how much showmanship he actually has and that he does know how to host a show. Andrew you're saint and I only see big things in your future. Keep helping people and god bless brother Babish.
this is your best episode yet!!! you're amazing!
I had no idea what to expect but this was just incredible. I am now at least 5 times more in love with you than I already was. Amazing work man. 👏🏼
Im literally crying right now I am so so happy that you are making an enormous difference in this mans life you are so generous and really know how to make people laugh and feel loved not only with food but with your heart.
Thank you so much
Andrew, you are truly a one of a kind soul. This is absolutely one of the most thoughtful acts of kindness I have ever seen. I was a committed follower before watching this, and am only more committed now. Your love of food, and Frasier quotes, will keep me coming back for as long as you keep doing your thing. Thank you for sharing your life and what your passion with us.
Honestly, I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. The editing was great, you helped out a cool guy, and you made it into an entertaining video that really helps all parties involved, both the maker/giver, the recipient, and the viewer. I look forward to episode two. 

Also it’s nice how you are doing nice things, but not trying to be MR Beast.
Thank you for making this. I was having a bad day, but watching this helped remind me it can always get better - and sometimes even when you aren't expecting it
First of all, all the tears I cried and second, I'm so in love with this!! I support this whole heartedly this is such a wonderful show!
Babish has me crying at work. Dang man. Great first episode, I can't wait to see what else you are able to do for these awesome people.
Because of this video, I subscribed to you. Peace and love, friend.
Damn, he straight up changed David's life. And David seems like the kind of person who deserves it too.
A huge... HUGE!!!! RESPECT to you sir!
So amazing thank you babish for being amazing and I wish this guy the best
Get you a man like Andrew! I loooved this so much. Thank you so much for creating!
I've always loved Binging with Babish and now this new series Being with Babish is better than any Ellen/Oprah/Dr. Phil all combined! That was freaking awesome!!!

Can we get this man a lifetime pass to disney?  He clearly deserves it
I may be crying in my office at work but I really needed to see this right now. Thank you for doing this, it's wonderful and beautiful and a bit of what the world needs these days.
I straight up cried!! CRIED!! Jesus Christ these men are out to kill me with dehydration. Andrew/Babish -the reason I haven't lost faith in humanity is because of people like you 👏
Wow.!just wow.! Kudus to you "Babish"..such a great job.!.. I was just so moved man. happy for David too..
You usually make me cry by chopping onions, but this one was beautiful my friend!
Dammit I wasn’t ready to cry today. You’re an amazing person Andrew. And you’re almost at 4 mil now.
Proud to be a long-time follower. You just made my day too. Keep up the good work man. So proud!
Bro this is the best YouTube video I’ve seen in a long time. Everything made me smile. Quite refreshing. :) you’re awesome, Andrew!
I was a bit concerned when I saw you were doing a YouTube show but I'm so glad I watched this, it's so wholesome
Wow, Its been a while since I was touched like this from a youtube video.  But following you from the beginning I am not surprised.  Thank you.
Andrew and Crew you all have such big hearts❤It makes me so happy to see videos like this. Keep up the good work!

okay I'm crying.. happy tears
Babish you're an amazing person. Most people who make it like you have don't pay it forward. This is an absolute heart warming video. It reaffirms my faith in humanity which is perilous at best most days. I truly hope and believe that you will continue to have success in anything you do. God bless you man.
damn you sir. damn you. you got me with this reveal that house level tear jerking! Bravo! Bravo! Orson Welles Hand clapping gif here!
Well, that's officially the most heartwarming thing I've seen in at least a year.

Suggested potential to recreate "scooter brothers" dead meme.
Scooter shot.
I cried

this show should be

"CRYING WITH BABISH"
what a deserving humble wonderful man... i’m bawling
There's something amazing about the concept of paying it forward, and showing compassion for others in this way. You're doing great things Andrew, and David too.
This is awesome! 
Been following you for a while and i'm really enjoying how your channel has been developing! Best of luck on your way to the top!
Best wishes from Norway :)
I love how you are giving back to those who need help and support. You are my favorite youtuber and I cannot wait for your next video! Keep up the incredible work!
I never thought I'd enjoy watching two bald bros with immaculate facial hair cooking and cruising around on a vespa so much.
[Fact fiend reference]
That's it, Andrew goes straight to ultra heaven.
Andrew, you are simply an amazing person!!!!
is it just me or does he look like a bald/bearded Ryan Reynolds or Ryan Gosling.
I honestly wasn't going to watch this video. But THANK GOD I did!! This made me cry and thank you Babish for helping him!  Keep up the great work dude!!
Also, when he said that his long term relationship didn't work out, I was like "damn, he's single now. Does that mean I have a chance? " :P
"Florida is a great state" ok babish blink twice if your ok blink once if Florida man had strike again
Hands down probably my favorite video on this channel!!! You’re an inspiration to all of us Andrew. I hope you have an awesome day!
This is the most wholesome thing ive ever seen, i may have been brought to tears at my work
I was hesitant to watch this for a couple of reasons. I am happy that I did, Andrew changed someone's life that deserved it and it was an amazing heart warming story.
What a person, all the best to his adventure and Minecraft Disney building. 
Was a really a great start to your series.
Whoever broke up with you, I got a question. 




I don’t get it.
This is hands down the most wonderful YouTube video I have seen all year, and probably longer than that! What a fantastic thing for you guys to do for a fan and fellow person. Absolutely loved it! Keep it going :)
This was lovely ❤️ thank you for helping this nice man!
Great job ..
ouch, this hurt my heart...😭 this is amazing.
Ok, so first impression when I saw the trailer: oh, it's just babish and his friends doing some cool guy stuff. They're riding bikes, prob getting tattoos together, going to Vegas, cooking, and just doing cool bro stuff.
Me, watching the show: CRYING babish is using his platform in order to help spread joy to fans and make some changes to their lives and it is overall wholesome and beautiful and so so so pure. My eyes started watering when andrew said that he was gonna cover his medication for an entire year. Bless you babish.
I’m in tears over this episode... wow... completely speechless. Many blessings to you Andrew.
God damn ninjas cutting onions 

Andrew, if I didn't like you before (which I did), I sure as hell do now. Thank you for doing such an amazing thing for someone who truly deserved it.
It's SO cool that you did this!  Had a rough day but this video just made me smile with complete happiness.  Thank you!!
I have always gotten so much joy out of your cooking videos, but this one by far takes the cake. 
You rock, Babish 🤘🏻
Subbed for the food.
Liked for the show's format.
Stayed for the life-changing content.
Wow. Babish. You are absolutely amazing. Keeping being amazing.
Andrew my man you are a crazy inspiration to me. I'm glad you started doing these. Keep up the good work and I'll keep enjoying.

Thank you for being so awesome.
I wish I could help my family this way too one day

So wholesome and heartwarming! I can't wait for more episodes.
Andrew you are one of the best if not the best cooking YouTubers on this platform I love your videos and you are an amazing person keep doing what your doing man your the best
Gosh, I didn't think we'd be cutting so many onions for this recipe.
I wish David ALL the good fortune. What a guy.
So many happy tears dude. I had such a craptastic day but seriously this brought me joy. You wonderful bald saint.💜❤💜❤
This man is a blessing and it's been such a good time watching his channel blossom. I'm deadass almost crying
This is HONESTLY one of the best videos I have ever seen. I love this so much. 😭😭
You just went from me adoring your channel to loving you as a person.
After that vespa scene u guys should make a buddy cop show
I just wanted to say thanks, Andrew; you are one badass guy, and you have a heart of gold, so thank you for your time, effort, and everything you do. Keep up the good work spreading smiles and love!
The ride off to Disney was the best! 😂 You are one cool dude!
God this is so sweet. This made me feel so good inside, thank you for being such a good person and helping other good people.♡
"I had a full head of hair,  but thanks to you guys everything has changed."

Guys WE made him loose his hair!
Love your show.  Yogurt chx(whatever it's called) is a big part of my repertoire now. You're doing great things, man. Keep it up!
"Starring Andrew Rea as Babish" Hmm.... lets change that... how about, Babish staring as Andrew Rea?

Inspirational Made Me Goosebump up Much Love from Omaha, Nebraska hopefully I can meet you one day.
Wasn't expecting you to go all Oprah on his fine moustached ass, but I'm sure happy you did! 

Really impressed, good job!
Damn the intro is like some kind of reality show from national geographic.
taking already the best cooking show on the platform to the whole another level
Andrew, I want to say this earnestly: You are such a beautiful, kind, caring, and truly humble person. We are lucky to have you on this small, small planet.
I'm not crying, you're crying. Also I love quiche. nothing wrong with two grown men on a Vespa.
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!
Listen, I absolutely LOVED the Brad and Vinny combo, but this, this is just beautiful. What a wonderful concept. Seeing that THIS is what he left BA for warms my heart and makes everything ok. This is Queer eye levels of wholesomeness and we sure as hell need more shows out there like it. So thank you. Thank you.
Andrew, this is by far the most beautiful thing you have ever done.  Keep on keeping on and thank you for a daily dose of faith in humanity.
This is themost wholesome man in the world his Mustache is so cute 😂❤️
I'm not crying, you're crying. Babish is the best.
Maybe another idea for a show: Brotime with Babish


A show where you tell us about your friends, drink beers and show what they do (cook/make/create/build/whatever) :D :D
What a beautiful way to start a new series. Keep up the great work man 💕✌️

Marvel: Infinity War is the most ambitious crossover in history.


Binging with Babish: Hold my beer.
This video literally made me cry. Bless you Babish and thank you for the videos and inspiration
This hit me in the Feels Babish! You’re fantastic!!!
That was amazing. I think someone must be chopping some onions around here though.
Seeing your channel grow over time has been amazing, what a journey. And such a great personality! Babiiiiiish!
Benevolence with Babish? Andrew you're such a great human being inspiring millions.
We're all so proud of how far you've come Andrew, keep it up!

You've filled our stomachs, and now you fill our hearts.
I've been watching for a very long time but I am so happy for you and your success. Thank you for making a positive change in the community. This video had me crying immediately and I hope luck turns around for David because he clearly deserves the best. You are such a kind person for all you did for him.
>uses windows
>gives him a mac and forces him to relearn how to use a computer
hey, uhhh, did you know that... ummm... it's a scooter shop?
That’s the most badass you can make a Vespa look ever. Also I love this video, that’s the coolest thing you did man. Andrew, you the boss.
I remember playing nonstop and eventually working on David’s original server a few years back. He totally deserves everything given to him, and David, if you’re reading this, best of luck to you!
Andrew is a remarkable person! This made my day :)
Why didn't I see this before?? Oh my heart. Mah soul.
Andrew, you're a good egg. this really got me. Well done man.
"Its a Scooter shop!"
He looks like an older Babish, and just as kind and sweet as well.
Damn it Babby I'm not crying, you're crying!
I actually found you a week ago and I am glad to be here maaaan. Please continue to be like this :)
So much respect for you man so proud that you did this keep up all the great work!
This video brought tears to my eyes! You are such a great human, Andrew.
Dumping Babish is like throwing away a cream cheese bagel.

it ain’t a good idea
Been a fan for a while and this is genuinely one of the most delightful things I've seen you do. Wonderful.
I gotta say, that's...that's amazing.  I'm so glad that you're taking what you've done with this channel, and giving back to the community like this.  It's stuff like this that makes me love and recommend this channel.  Were there onions in that quiche?  Cause I'm totally not crying right now.
This channel needs more subscribers
Just awesome man it's great to see videos like this. I've been watching binging with babish for a while now and the food just looks so amazing. I have yet to try some recipes because I'm not that great with food.
wait... is vinny... THE vinny? like vincesco from Its Alive w/ Brad?
can we talk about how HOT that intro is?? you beautiful creature...
I'm literally crying. This is so heartwarming. ;__;
That's it. Settled. 

You're the best guy on YouTube
Andrew, this is amazing! I can't wait to watch this series grow!!!
Babish my guy you literally drove that Vespa on the most dangerous turn in Winter Park
Honestly can't find the words. I'm so moved. Very glad I found you!!!
WOW!!! I am totally speechless (but will still type). I'm wiping tears from my eyes trying to type after watching BEING.  Definitely my new favorite thing to watch.  Keep being real, inspiring hope, and creating some joyous tears!!!!
This is very heart warming I love your videos and this an amazing thing your doing for your fans
Ah the water works are rEAL!!! This man deserves the world. Andrew is awesome for doing this for David. I hope he is still doing great :)
>minecraft youtuber in a cooking youtuber's video
what is this, a crossover episode?
Dude your a generous mofo. Unbelievably nice video. Warmed me and my girlfriend's hearts.
I love feel good stuff like this really warms my cold jaded heart
This is amazing. What a moving episode to kick the series off. If I could, I'd subscribe twice (suppose I'll just make another account to do so). Keep on the amazing work!
Yo Babish lad, any way to donate for this series?
Yes, more of this please. Came for the cooking & stayed for the personality
This makes me so happy! I am glad you can to help someone in Orlando!
Absolutely beautiful. God bless you, Babish.
This made my cry the happiest tears ever! I just wanna hug both of you so tight, you're both such amazing people for wanting to help everyone you can. That has always been my life goal, to help anyone and everyone however I can. It blows up in my face sometimes but it usually works out amazingly in the end and makes me feel amazing with the kindness.
This really makes me think even more now that Andrew is one of the best creators on this platform. It confirms it actually.
And now I'm crying. Thanks Babbi.
Love this episode!  thank you for making my day!
Jeeeeebus.... this man is actually amazing... despite all his hardships... he is still pushing forward. Computer from junk parts.. in a cardboard box. Broke a valuable gift from a friend that passed away aaaaaaaaaaannnd has had so many problems... wtf.. this episode made me cry ;-;
No words 😶 this was so uplifting to see thank you you guys are doing great things 😀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧
I've been avoiding watching this video all day.

Not because I don't want to see it.

But because I know I'm going to cry like a little bitch  in this video.

Edit: It was at the laptop. David's reaction around there is what did me in.
Thank you for doing this series! Can't wait to see the rest! Also it's crazy seeing you driving around my neighborhood on a vespa and shopping at my Publix! Haha Kinda bummed I didn't run into while you were here! Haha Keep kicking ass sir!
Prime example of how good karma works. Don't ever doubt it folks.
What you did was beautiful man. Keep being you
This world needs more people like you! Bless you Babish!!!
The year pass to disney world brought out the water works. This is the most wholesome and amazing thing I've ever seen on youtube.
Andrew bro.....you the goat 🐐 for this!! Super dope to see you give back like this!!!
In tears this was amazing to watch and I'm so glad to see it!
Congrats man, beautiful first episode.
Amazing. I loved this. Good on you both.
Wholesome hours intensify
Dude. You rock! Great vid, great idea, great execution! Cheers!
This is really wholesome, I'm loving it buddy!!!!
This is probably the best beginning of a series that I have ever seen
For everyone who disliked:
Just...why?
Did not expect to see Antvenom, that takes me back
No onions in this quiche but I'm in tears. Such a nice thing to do. Keep it up Babish.
Now that was beautiful, from start to finish. What a wonderful thing you have done, and what wonderful things David does to bring joy to people out there. Fuck, I'm not crying! Ok, maybe I am. But this was so lovely, and I look forward to more of Being with Babish. <3
The real duckie! I’m shook
What a sweet man. He has so much love to give!
Can this guy be a regular on the show?
He's very personable and fun to watch. I'd like to see him cook.
You did amazing, Andy. Thanks to Sawyer and Vinny too. ❤
Eyes.....Watering.  I'm cutting onions I swear!!
This warmed my heart. This is what the world needs, a kind heart and a generous spirit like yours. I'm sure that you have made and will keep making a lot of people happy. Thank you!!☺️❤️
and you get a scooter!
and you get a scooter!
and you get a scooter!
and you get a scooter!
and you get a scooter!
No kosher salt involved? Thats a paid actor not babish. Cant fool me
IM NOT CRYING. YOURE CRYING!
anybody know the IP for this mans server?
Keep doing good things keep true👍🏼🙏❤️
Guess I'm crying now, thanks.
“What did babish cook up for me this time?”

“Oh, tears? Whole tears? Yep”
You, Andrew, are the best 👍🏼
So much true emotions... So damn good man! I respect you more for your good soul and humanity than your awesome culinary skills! 😍
I always knew you were a nice guy Andrew, but to do this type of work?  To help people in this capacity?  Wow.  You're amazing dude.  Glad that David is getting help from you and I hope he continues on his little road of happiness and helping other people too.  The greatest thing about helping someone is, is them being able to pass that on to someone else.
This video made my week. I cried. :') Thanks Andrew!
Bro I’m literally crying what in the babish this was beautiful man.. you’re damn inspiring brother
this is awesome! keep it up babby
Babish you beautiful bastard. This made my heart happy.
Thanks for making me cry Andrew.
I'm cryin in the club rn, this is so beautiful and inspiring and I can't wait to see more
the moment that hit me with the feels man was when he got the pass.
Babish my man you inspired me to become a chef and hopefully i can make you proud by making some dame good food and making some dame good people just that bit happier.
I love this so much. I knew I was going to cry but man. You are so kind and wonderful. Even though you stole vinny from brad, you’re one of my absolute favorite you tubers and people.
This is an amazingly wholesome video. I love it.
Amazing episode, looking forward to the next one! Is vinny from BA really with him? What happened? How do I find out?
Wow. Damm onions making me tear up. Amazing.
The szechuan sauce video was the video that introduced me to BWB. I guess without David,i wouldn't have found your channel. Thanks David!
I cant decide on if a mac is the best decision because of web design, or if its the worst because of gaming?
I think Ive decided its perfect and this man deserves it all
This made my bones feel good
Oh Babish, you beautiful man!
Great idea and episode.  Awesome.. it made my day. Great job Babby!
Giving away 15k worth of sauce is AMAZING,  something that I would have a lot of trouble to think about. This gentleman is the real deal.
This has to be the best first episode that you could have created. I really hope that David's life becomes as magical as Disney. You can tell when there is good in someone and this guy overflows with goodness.
If we could bottle the kindness you give so freely, we could solves so many of the worlds ills.
You are exactly how we are supposed to be to each other.
I know there is a lot of work going on, that the camera doesn't show but, the finished product is as good as it gets from where I sit.
Thanks for being so funny, informative, kind and loving to your fellow human beings.
This makes me really proud of everything that this channel has done and accomplished. <3
That ending montage was equal parts clumsy and sexual. 

I freaking love it.
I was enticed by the movie food, stayed for the anime cuisine and now I'm crying over these life changing snack seshes:') damn you babish for giving me more reasons to love the beauty of food!
Literally been watching your vids for half a year and just realized im not subbed for some reason
this is the wholesome content i crave thank you babish :)
this is so beautiful!
Wow i didn't know he did this. Thats awesome babish
Bro, you got the fastpass to -5000 karma, the world owes YOU.
The nuts to butts on the bike was funny as hell. Keep it up "Oliver"
this was very selfless, you can tell how much you changed his life. im excited to see the next episode, good job andrew
Man, I gotta admit, i teared up a bit. Good on ya brother. Beautiful.
VINNY? YOU HAVE A VOICE??!!

Oh Babish, your Brad fans thank you.
This is amazing! Honestly hurts my heart with joy.
This is such a beautiful episode. Thanks for spreading the positivity.
I’m cry 
So heartwarming ♥️
Man it’s been years since I’ve heard Antvenoms voice
This makes me feel happy man. thank you.. :)
IT'S A SCOOTER SHOP BABYYYYYYYYYYYY
Just found your channel. Going to binge on some videos. This one warmed my heart.
This is so inspiring blessings to everyone who need it
Binging with Babish? More like Binging with a Saint.
These series are so wholesome, love it so so much. You really are a fantastic being!
Add this to the list of places I never thought I'd see AntVenom
goddam these vids that puts tears in my eyes. I HATE CRYING. BUN YOU!!
We need more videos like this @BingingWithBabish, please keep them going!😭
I'm going to rewatch this episode before Endgame so my tear ducts are dry going in.
m y  f e e l s
Truly awesome and inspiring!!! Good on you bud
I want to be as cool as David when I'm his age. Dude has style.
Babish isn't disappointing us, he earned our trust and he immediately tries to do the right thing. I'm so glad he made it.
When you said catfished by Antvenom I was really worried that  someone who was such a big part of my childhood had done something bad. Glad to see he's still doing well.
You’re an amazing man. You helped a man in a really rough time and you used your own money to fund his happiness. You are an amazing person. Its amazing to know there are people like you out in this world
Just here to say publix rocks!
Damn Andrew, you are as beatifull on the inside as your Beard. God bless ya.
Okay. Babish is officially on my really, really short list of youtubers I'd like to meet.
Right next to Rhett and Link, and the game grumps.
What can't money get you?


Happiness.


But maybe it can buy you a scooter that you can drive on the road towards happiness. Starting with the happiest place on Earth.
If you ever want to make a new series, David and you should go around a city on a Vespa and review restaurants, or cook, or whatever, cause you two click really well!
Sawyer makes the love triangle perfect.
I'm crying in the airport. Screw you Babish.
David and Andrew make a great duo.
It's a scooter shop.
I always wished to have the resources to do this for people. Great job. Look forward to more.
This made us all teary-eyed. Both me and my wife. Thank you and thank David. He seemed awesome. Loved the mustache.
Top 5 coolest stories/videos i’ve ever watched on Youtube.
Incredible the amount of emotion welling up inside me after watching this video. Just by helping one person you made millions feel helped as well and for that I applaud you.
Can we get a Patreon up and started for David to cover his medical bills? Would be glad to help out with some bucks
Ok now. Best video lately!
Me: just seeing the intros 
Me: UWU
This guy is amazing. Much loce to you man.
This was awesome of you Andrew aka Babish! God bless you for helping that man out!!! You are an angel in disguise.
Absolutely love this bloke. Babish you should be super proud of the person you have become. Stay classy legend
Andrew, this is such a beautiful thing you did. If everyone was as generous as you the world would have infinitely fewer problems. Thank you.
Andrew. I am beyond touched by the selflessness you had in this video. You are truly a great person and I am so happy to be a subscriber and to have my bell turn on for you. Continue all the good you do. Keep making people smile and always know that the love you give your fans will be turned ten fold back to you. Keep being amazing!!
It's so great to see someone spreading their own good fortune and making an impact in all sorts of ways. Binging with Babish is already such a warm show that makes a small, positive impact in my day when I watch him, but it's so great to see the larger overtures too.
WOW, MAN. GOD BLESS AND MORE POWER!
how does someone dump someone who can cook like this?
Andrew Motherfucking Rae is an absolute hero. This guy is such an amazing person.
Been a big fan for a long time, seen damn near every video, but I gotta say I loved this, keep this series going.
Thank you for doing stuff like this!
I must be cooking too because damn onions making my tear up!
10:52
Look in the background. Andrew switched places because he didn't want David to see the Vespa outside.
A FUCKING KING!!!!! Love what you did for the man, you reminded me that after all success isn't all about making money. It's about having enough to give other people as well. Who knew cooking could mean so much more.
God bless Publix. Babish, you must try the almighty chicken tender sub.
This is great. Awesome work, guys.
Casey Neistat has left the chat
This warms my heart in so many levels. Way to spread some love, Andrew.
Andrew, you’re the man. This was so cool to see.
Phenomenal. I can't wait to see more of these.
How do I acquire a babish?
>won Szechuan sauce
>shares to friends instead of profit
>gets supported by babish
I want to say calculated but I know this ain’t it chief
This is utterly beautiful, Andrew. Thank you so much for giving back like this.
Hell yeah Babish, you're amazing
2 dudes chilling in a kitchen making some quiche together like some dudes.
I absolutely love this.. why am I crying!?
Binging with Babish isnt supposed to MAKE ME CRY THIS ISNT ALLOWED
Andrew, I full blown happy cried. Love your channel and that you do!
Wow. I love seeing youtubers making such a difference and wow what an amazing thing you did Andrew. Again wow. Truly amazing.
I'm too pregnant to watch this. Sat here bawling like a baby. Quality content! ❤️❤️❤️
Andrew I love this. This is such a great video and a great cause. I hope this is the direction creators take on this platform. In a world with so much negativity people like you make the difference
Jeezus Christ! Babish turned into Oprah!!! Everybody is getting a Vespa!
I'm gonna go buy a salmon tomorrow because of this 👍
i had never cried like this in a babish episode, you´re the greatest Andrew Rea
THE MEETING OF TWO PURE BOIS
Instantly the nicest Youtuber I've ever watched.
Thanks Babish for making my ass cry on public transportation
Congrats Andrew, this is the first episode to make me cry
Wow. I feel so good after watching that. What a guy.
Awesome thing you did there man. Much respect :)
Amazing work. Great episode
That key toss and almost catch was everything! :D
This is so freaking wonderful and heart warming I love it
Babish, I occasionally watch your videos especially when its a food item that interest me. However, i think i will for sure be a regular viewer as this is an amazing concept. Youtubers earn a good amount and have many opportunities, some choose to hold onto that personally. Its amazing to see someone selflessly useing that to give back to their audience. Especially with so many people who struggle. Im excited to see more people you help along the way.
Fuggin love Publix. Pub sub gang for life 👹
goddamn making me cry far out dude you have a good heart
This is the wholesome content I subscribed to this channel for 😊
Babish over here introducing 4D video... Somehow cutting onions in MY house.
I'm not crying. You're crying! (Actually we're all probably crying.)
That was amazing!  Thank you so much for  being such a great human!
😭🖤🖤🖤👏👏👏👏
AntVenom on this channel ? That's pretty cool
I got all sorts of chills from watching this! Loved it
Mr. Andrew is a good being.
this episode lives through Vinny's editing :)
This guy got a bit more than 15k out of his Szechuan Sauce. MUCH MORE.
Mad respect for the mustache, man. I love it.
the 422 people diss liked this vid thats cold and rude
<3 <3 <3 !!!! I LOVE THIS
this video restored my faith in humanity bless up 🙏
That was an extraordinarily heartwarming episode. Also the Scooter Montage was great, you almost managed not to laugh.
Great episode man. Respect ;-)
Yknow, at first I didn’t really want to watch this episode
“Eh it’s not cooking so why bother”
But... I’m really glad I changed my mind.
I stumbled across this series today and I very much hope you continue with it!!!
Damn bro this shit good 🥺💘
2 bald beautiful men, 2 beautiful beards and 2 beautiful souls. Bless both of y’all.
Vinny from It's Alive is working with you. Awesome!
It's 1:30 PM and all I've done today is watch your videos.
That made me want to cry. That was just wonderful.
Babby you are a legend. Thank you
Were they cutting onions? Two bald men made me cry...
lets get this man a piece prize.. 3 years in and he's straight to helping others
This is my new favorite show!
Antvenom... long drag off smoke I haven't heard that name in years...               very cool for you guys to give back, Both Antvenom and Andrew
David totally looks like he could be your Dad.
Hey Andrew....poaching Vinnie was definitely worth it. Thank you for this series. Thank you Vinnie for this beautiful story.
Nothing can describe the sheer amount of joy I felt while watching this
love this, truly inspiring
this is so wholesome i-
it's a scooter shop
it's a vespa shop
it's a scooter shop
IT'S A SCOOTER SHOP BABY
Dude... You guys are the absolut best!
Good job andrew, doing the lords work and looking badass doing it.
SCOOTER SHOP BABY
God damnit man, is someone cutting onions? Where are the onions?!
Andrew, cooking is one thing, but what you did with this episode is extra human. It goes beyond a limit of a regular cooking show. You're a hero
My heart NEEDED this, this video was food for my soul.
This was beautyful on so many levels. 👍
really wanted to hate this video bc you stole vin and just thinking about brad without him makes ME sad, but seriously you're doing so much good here-- keep it up babby!!!
This was way more wholesome than I was ready for... Damn.. I think someone is cutting onions in the other room...
HOLY CRAP!!  You knocked episode one out of the park.  Talk about setting the bar high.  You've one of the greatest things a person can, you helped someone who needed it.
ITS A SCOOTER SHOP BAAABYY
god dammit. I'm at work and you put this on me. Standing here trying to not cry, looking like I'm trying not to have diarrhea in my office.
This made me smile so much! He really deserves every bit of goodness!
Really nice to see a youtuber giving back to the community. You're a good one, Mr. Babish :)
When I feel hungry: Watch Binging with Babish.
Now, when I feel sad/lose faith in humanity: Watch Being with Babish.
It’s gonna be a good time.
You just went up to Awesome Guy Level.
Oh my goodness!! Babish  good on ya!!! So wonderful seeing this!!
I forgot I could feel like this...bless you Babish and David!
The most coolest dude ever, babish your the greatest just remember that 👍
Around 10 minutes in, the video became really blurry. Might want to look into that.
I haven't subscribed to a YouTuber in years, but this...this was so unexpectedly heartwarming.
I'm crying thank you so much
You're legit one of a kind Babish
I live in Florida and I don't even really like it. It was better as a vacation spot.
this man should have his own platform for making videos
he has transcended YouTube
Please make big smoke's order from GTA San Andreas
Really good stuff. Love the branding too its clever tying it all together. Good vibes
Great video! except for the end where they were cutting all those onions which I know they were because I defiantly wasn't bawling my eyes out.
This is the most wholesome video I've seen in a looong while 😭💞
That's by far the one best episodes babish has done. Keep up the amazing work sir.
I'm just smiling through the hole video this is SO COOL
This was fantastic. Can't wait to see more!
Beautiful! Seeing how grateful he was was so sweet
You guys are good,hi from Barbados
Is this the same vinny? My man vinchenzo? Its alive vinny?
I was crying in my damn school. People came up towards me and asked if I was okay
My heart is hurting this is..wow
This is the most wholesome thing i’ve seen all this year so far and I love it!
Man, that was great, amazing episode!
This video was wholesome af. Wasn't prepared for the feels. Also, great camera work, Vinny
But did you try a Publix sub?
That was so lovely. I got feels from watching.
Keep doing good things, Babish!
So much love. Adorable. Totally cried.
Man, I swear you cut some onions and put em in that quiche.
it took what feels like forever for me to find time to sit down and watch this....worth the wait man
Marvelous first episode! Glad to see that David  will be doing much better going forward.


Side note, I see Babby buying a motorcycle in the future.
This is the best thing I've seen on the Internet in so long.
this video is absolutely precious and I can't wait to see more. I wish I could hug you, and everyone else who helped to make this video possible.
Shout out to David for keeping the Apron on while hitting up the Haunted Mansion.... Legend hahaha

This was beautiful. Absolutely incredible what you did for that selfless man, you have a good heart dude. You truly do ❤
Get this man his own Netflix show
Andrew . .. ..one of the few men who can look BADASS on a scooter. ....while being on the back....
David seems like such a amazing person. I hope this series continues forever.
14:02 Blaring "IT'S A SCOOTER SHOP BABY" Out Loud with Babish
Man this is great and you're a good guy Mr. Babish!
You're awesome! This is so inspiring, not only do you kill it in the kitchen you're just an amazing human being!
This is so amazing. What a wonderful human being.
Babish deserves greatness and prosperity in his future
Dude I remember Antvenom from the old 2012-13 Minecraft days
OH MY GOD YOU HAD HAIR!!!!!! AND A BEARDLESS BEARD?!?!?!?!?!
I cried this was beautiful 💕
This is the most heart warming thing on Earth
aww you making me cry at werk, you sneaky bastards
AntVenom. The only MC Youtuber that I still sub too because I just see him everywhere doing God's work.
Awesome job Babbish, one more reason to love what you do !!!!
Babish and AntVenom in a video?? Thats a mashup and a change of pace.
Beards and bald heads unite ❤
You are the best, and the most kind person Andrew
Dang Babish you are a master onion chopper. 😭
Stupid Babish making me feel stuff! Great stuff man.
Wholesome is Babish. Love and respect to ya mate.
I lovs this show. Keep it up!!!
Sometimes u do something (many things) nice because u are a loving and caring person and it spreads some love and multiplies many times over and just a little bit comes back to you when you really need some of that love and just that tiny fraction is enough to fill you up.
Crying with Babish. This warmed my heart so much
OMG Babish!!! What you did was amazing. I’m so moved rn 😭💕
This video was amazing giving back to the people that made this channel so good to see
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING SHUT UP IT'S FROM THE ONIONS IN THE QUICHE
damn onion ninjas. had to pause the video a few times.
AntVenom, haven't heard that name in a long time.
I'm not crying, you crying!
I don't watch binging with Babish to cry. But I'm okay with it.
Those damn onion cutting ninjas are at it again...
love this so much! thankful that julien solomita sent me to this!
“Keep cooking, I will if you will.” Is easily one of the most powerful things I’ve heard and ideky
I'm so jealous of your life. You're awesome sir.
Yesssssss 😂🙏
This is the most WHOLESOME THING IVE EVER SEEN
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😭
Favorite episode ever... no questions asked....
Incredible stuff... watched this at work during lunch, bad timing...


Much love from Barcelona!
I HAD to like this video twice. Omg. This 💜
found this channel roughly 2 years ago and ever since then its always been one of my favorites and videos like this only support that, love the content man.
Awesome episoooode! Great man 👍🏼
Lol. Andrew driving the Vespa like it’s a Harley.
“Runs Minecraft server”

Ah, I see your a man of culture
This is really just so amazing, man. Can’t wait to see more and more. So heartwarming. Been watching you for a long time and seeing you grow from a little guy, to someone helping out the little guys, is amazing.
What a pivot episode. Knocked it outta the park man.
I’m all warm and fuzzy now.  Thanks for giving back!
Its a scooter shop
I'm not crying, you're crying. 

I'm glad I work in a kitchen instead of up front with customers. 😂
I love Supportive Cashier Man
This is one of the coolest things I’ve seen a YouTuber do. Like donating, but on a personal level, focusing on quality over quantity. I fully support this idea, and encourage other celebrities to give this a try.
Babish is the most humble kind put together person I've ever seen what a nice guy
So, apparently Andrew is even cooler IRL than he is on the show. Nice to know.
You are a good Egg Bro. That's why I support this channel 100%.
its almost 2 am and im huddled next to a laptop crying.
Best video ever man
The view outside the window - watching someone sneak in the bike -- he getting emotional about the laptop and me talking to the screen saying "Oh you haven't seen anything yet?" UGH ALL THE FEELS. So much love for him.
dang babish! always surprising me with your good vibes and new blogging ventures! great stuff! i loved it
Look at Babish flexing on all of us with his yellow gold Rolex Daytona. Anyway, great choice Andrew.
Remember Babish, if a person has a Why to live they can make it through and How.
Good job Babish you made me ugly cry
Hope you’re happy
Andrew, you are a great guy. I've been a fan of your series since you started and I have tried your recipes many times. Yours is my favorite cooking show and sometimes I just watch your videos because I enjoy them so much, even though I may not be cooking anything.


This new project makes me feel real good. I have been going through a lot lately, with a recent divorce, my friends and part of my family turning their back on me, feeling lonely and lately my girlfriend leaving me and me being medicated for depression, it feels like I have no hope. But this video made my day. See you do something nice for somebody makes me feel happy, even teary-eyed. Thank you for this.
My heartttttt ahhhh ❤❤
I didnt know I needed this series in my life
Happy. Happy. Happy. Man your amazing. ❤️Keep being you
❤️ awesome 
A lot of faith restored
Who TF broke your heart? I just wanna talk👿👿👿
i love it and i love you omg
This is beautiful 😭
IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING
a cooking channel has no business making me this emotional
WOW! That is so different from what I would have thought you would be doing for your new show. What an awesome idea and so amazing that you are going to be helping people out. :D This is exceptional content. Thank you so much for all your videos but these, these are going to be extraordinary. :)
This is all I needed today 🙌🏽💙🙏🏽
This is the mf'n wholesome content I need in my life
I love this! You and your crew have hearts of gold! Please do Disney Turkey Leg Recipe!
I dont ever see two men on one vesper look so manly.
give this man a netflix show already
If I didn't already find myself very impressed by Andrew as a person, this has shown such genuine kindness. I'm proud to be a fan of Babish.
You give us Andrew's a good name. Keep on filming, brother.
Why is your voice so soothing? Fall asleep to your vids all the time.
I’m not crying.....aww forget it yes I am. That was soooo awesome!!!!!! You’re the man Babish!
Binging, basics, bedtime, being with Babish 
What’s next?  👇🏽
un-Boxintg with Babish
nothing like two bald bearded men on a vespa
I can't stop watching this for the feel goods right in the heart
I knew you were a cool guy! But this just adds a whole new level
Absolutely the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen. Looking forward to every episode of this show to come
I’m legit crying
THe emotion in David’s voice was too much.
Love You David 
Yo too Babish
this is god damn beautiful and here  I am, crying on the toilet
Awesome! Exactly what this world needs!
you need either a youtube red series, or a Food Network Series.
God I love Publix!
Oh hair, the only valid sacrifice to the God of Cooking so you can get better at toasting the buns, while you use tiny wisk
Holy crapola  Andrew your such an amazing person your so nice I can’t-
This is actually so freaking awesome
It warms my heart to see kindness in the world.
Last year was hell both parents died, uncle, dog put to sleep and my health deteriorated however you live in hope as New year starts life will cut you a break however this year as we approached anniversary of mums death on 14th Feb my father in law died on 10th Feb and my best friend suddenly on 13th Feb just aged 51 a fun loving, vibrant never ill woman who I had known since I was 18 we were always there to catch the other during bad times and celebrate joy of life in good times and inbetween plod on with daily life. 
My heart feels broken. 
As I am mainly house and now bed confined I so miss cooking so I get my fix watching show.
This Being with Babish shows there is goodness and hope in the world you just have to take mini steps and eventually something will give u warm fuzzy feeling. Tq x
Just another reason why Babish is the bomb! Dude was in the same state I live in and just a few hours away too.
I've seen a lot of charitable acts on YouTube. None have had the geniunity that this had. Enough said.
MAH HEART!!!!!
The Disney pass? Sure. The Laptop? Yeah cool cool. The Vespa? Okay thats a hell of a thing. But the year of Heart meds... That's what put me over the damn top. What an awesome, awesome gift to give.
Jesus man I could feel the emotion on that reveal, in tears.
Who's better than us Vincenzo
It's awesome to see big YouTubers being awesome to others. Hope that others will follow suit.
ROCHESTER PLATES HAT I LOVE IT
Don’t mind me just crying at work.
Can't wait for your PornHub original series 'Banging with Babish'
I was sitting here thinking "I'm not gonna cry, I'm not that person" I AM THAT PERSON. this is so sweet and I love you so much Babish
PUBLIX!!!!
You're legendary 😎👌
Um wow! 

Crying
Wow. I didn’t know this was a corner of YouTube that I needed, but man am I thrilled to have found it. Julien Solomita mentioned that this was his favorite video of the week in the Jenna & Julien podcast. I jumped over to check it out and was not disappointed! Wow! So good! I’ll be back for sure!
I love when Youtubers give back! Makes me happy! Parents be wondering why I’m crying! 😭😭❤️❤️
I'll be honest, this made me smile. From the darkest pits of my depressed mentality, and the lot of it, I must say, this indeed made me smile. Babish, your a mate and a half lad. Keep on cookin'.
What a beautiful couple :)
yes. period.
Ugh! I walk down that street that the Vespa store is on almost every day! I can’t believe I missed you! I would’ve said “hi!” 💔
My mom didn't sign the permission slip for this feels trip, man...
actually one of my favorite episodes
I want to be Babish's friend...so cool, so crazy, so beautiful.
Commenting to show approval!!
Wow... you're awesome dude
Do I smell a being with banish/it’s alive going places collab? 😁
Andy, you made me cry.
Just came from your "the Swanson" episode, just wanna say your impressions were freaking hilarious, I was cracking up picturing you doing the voice over.  & I'm also pretty stoked that you're gonna be doing vlogs now, can't wait to see what adventures you have instore for us!
I started crying hard on this thanks Babish
This is dope, much love
Visits guy with heart problems.
Buys a ton of cheese and eggs for quiche. :D
Goddamn man... God bless
That's bad ass Babish.. good guy that's right up my alley.
0:24 You look like bald Dwight from Dead by Daylight
Babish, you made me cry at work 

What a great episode!
This is why I'm still on youtube
god bless you sir
This made me tear up. I love this new show
Much love for this !
I’m a little  mad you took Vinny away from Brad. but at least this episode was good.
Ooo ya grab him~
really great video! i also appreciate that it’s a good length and not like an hour long
Why am I crying in the club rn?
I'm not crying, I'm just cutting onions
Dude you made my week, it's been rough. Thank you.
thanks to us you lost that cool hair
God bless you
OMG the things Youtubers do ☺️
Babbish, you are a truly amazing person.
I must say i can definitely feel for David,  and what  Babish is doing is not only kind but very generous.😄👌
STOP CUTTING THE ONIONS DAMMIT
So rad!! New to the series after DeFranco being such a supporter and some friends tipping their hat to you too. Love it and can’t wait to see more!
Being With Bald Man
Publix!!!!!
If I found out I gave away $15k worth of sauce I’m pumping stomachs 😂😂😂
His reaction is priceless at 9:47, wow Andrew you really made day. Doing whatever it is that you enjoy
why am i crying in the scooter shop rn
this was awesome! <3
I'm not crying. You're crying. Stop cutting onions. What onions. I need a tissue.
This episode is just crazy. I bought Minecraft again last year (I had played since about 2012 I don’t remember the exact year) because I switched computers but one of the only reasons I rebought it was because of David’s Disney World recreation because of how many memories it gave me during my childhood (big WDW fan btw). So glad that he was able to be the first in this amazing series. Thanks Babish
Come for the food, stay for the feels.
This brought so much warmth to my heart. I am beyond excited for more videos like this.
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING.
YOU'RE AMAZING!
Oh man, Antvenom!? What a blast from my past, always a chill dude.
Why am I in freaking tears
Seeing banish with hair, has, uhhh...... I don't know, I feel like a different person, someone......send help, NOW!!

We need more wholesome content like this, for the whole internet
You are amazing, Andrew
I can say for once that these fifteen minutes have made my life better
I was already in love but now.... a strong enough word does not exist.
this was the sweetest episode ever 😭
I am absolutely flabberghasted how amazing this episode was
It’s a scooter shop!
Never would’ve expected to see anything about ant venom here, very wholesome content
woooow 😱 u r a very good human being and i hope that there will be more people inspired to do good
Just when i thought it was impossible to love babby anymore...
WHO'S HERE FOR VINCENZO ?!!! <3
This is by far the coolest thing ever
Andrew, you good person.
his hair switched positions
there’s so many bad things going on in the world that we lose sight of the kindness that most people have. thanks for reminding your viewers that good things happen :)
andrew rea is too pure for this world
You're a good dude
Keep spreading the love Babish!
You. Are. Amazing.
Wow I came here to cook and got served some sweet, sweet feels. The Lord and savior Babby
This was so wonderfully sweet
Blessed with Babish
It's a scooter shop
You're a breath of fresh of air Andrew, the world will repay you for all the kindness that you put out. Keep it up man
Who's chopping onions around here? 😭😭😭
This was amazing ❤
This was wonderful!!!
This has to be the only video made about being generous that doesn't feel like it's just for clicks and money.
Literally the most epic video ever!
Nothing is fake, all kindness!
It's nice to take a break from the unfortunates in news and see this piece of kindness being shared around. From nothing to something even more takes a lot of steps. I admire the persistence, devotion and care being put into this.
okay but where'd you get the vespa
Your the greatest man ever.
Well done Andrew, well done.
It's been a rough one lately.  This brought a big smile to my face.  Thank you.
This guy runs a Minecraft server?! Where od I sign?
Two bald men with beards bonding over food. Love it.
I am happy tonight because of this.
Great stuff! Usually I am not the type of guy that comments under videos, but today I felt like you really deserved it! I love when people are greatful for their sucess and even give back to others in need.
Keep up the fantastic work!

Greetings from Germany!
Gregor
This is so cool.  Thank you.
You're crying!!!
This is the best ✌
Does this spinach quiche recipe have onions in it? Because that's my excuse to why my face is tearing up right now.
i can... FEEL the inner turmoil as you said "florida is a great state".
I absolutely loved this beautiful wholesome video. It's great to see you giving back and always trying new creative projects. Congrats to everyone who worked hard to make this new series!!
jesus, youre such a nice guy
this was beautiful
You're an amazing person this was great to see someone helping a complete stranger like this
scooter shop
I see why Vinny left BA for this. This was fantastic!!
See this makes me proud to be a fan! You're one hell of a guy, Andrew.
Ive never really seen your face, but you look like Ryan Reynolds dude
Look out the window when he's the laptop
Babish, you’re incredible.
God damnit, I'm a grown ass man, built tough as nails and here I am crying about two wholesome humans being bros...
I don't comment on stuff often but this is awesome. Way to go
I don’t cry from stupid YouTube videos.




And this YouTube video wasn’t stupid
I genuinely think I’m a pretty tough guy. But this made me vry
I like how he sits in the "escape route" seats on the plane.  Makes enough from this to help out fans, but still doesn't flex on us with first class.
I'm concerned about your scalp in the Florida sun my friend.
LOVE THIS!
I needed this today its good to see there is still hope
This is awesome
I'm crying.  You're an inspiration, Babish.  And the fact that you have another one queued up and intend to continue this series in earnest is so goddamn powerful.  Hopefully whoever finds the charred remains of our civilization will find examples of humanity like you to represent us.
This is giving me serious queer eye vibes
I am SERIOUSLY looking forward to this new show!!! I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE WHAT’S NEXT???👍🏻👌🏻👏🙏
This is full of feel good vibes
Faith in humanity - restored.
Imagine relaxing in your Florida home, when suddenly a bald man on a Vespa whizzes past yelling "IT'S A SCOOTER SHOP, BABAAAY!!"
omg antvenom <3
This has a criminally low amount of views and likes
It's a scooter shop baby
so dusty in my study right now
You sir, legit had me crying right along side that gentleman.  Well done, you have begun a journey that few could ever say they make.  From the bottoms of both my stomach and heart, thank you for being you and sharing such wonder and good will with us.  Bless you Babbish.
It’s a scooter shop baby
Oh, and two wheels... The ONLY way to roll!
Okay now I’m not so mad at you for stealing vinny
Awesome work!!!!
That was really cool of you!
Legend!
Babish is basically apart of the Fab Five now
like a bald oprah with glasses
Damn and I thought you were cool before... You have got to be one of the most generous people I have ever seen, this was insane! Can’t wait for the next episode!
and I thought I didn't cry at shows. never mind.
Best Babish Ever <3
The onions are coming through the phone hardcore. You are an amazing person!
This was sooo dope!
WELL I HOPE YOU LIKE TEARS IN THAT QUICHE BABISH
Damn youre amazing
I love this,I’m a fan of yours and I get happy watching your videos since I love cooking
7:41 Blew me away
Andrew is hipster Santa. Christ this is heart warming.
My eyes were drying out from my contacts a little, then I watched this episode...


Problem solved.



I already liked Babish as a person, as a chef and an entertainer.  Now I love him as a human.
woah, this is wholesome.
I'm literally in tears, what
Wow😍 that’s amazing
IT’s a ScoOteR shOp
Stylish, good looking, good cook and a big heart... You Andrew, you're what I aspire to be..
If you ever need help in Denmark, contact me.
Anybody else just like hearing his voice?
But wait why you not wearing a helmet when you go to disneyland🥶 is that legal🤔
Goddamn precious
What a great heart warming episode I am choked up right now almost to tears
he's like the Oprah of cooking shows, god I love your show. keep being awesome!
This is so amazing... i have no words at how coll his is.
😭😭😭 that was the best thing I seen all year. I literally can’t right now
alot of hearts
Fucking awesome video, I didn’t think I could like babish anymore but this was amazing.
Binging with Babish: Where is Gamora
Basics with Babish: Who is Gamora
Being with Babish: WHY is Gamora
Oh no, the internet turned Andrew bald
Damn, this has got me in the feels at 5 am.
I'm so happy for you Babish
Ant Venom best youtuber
i love that vinny directed this. such an amazing dude. and YOU'RE an amazing dude. y'all the freaking best.
I cannot love this enough.
So many onions. Babby, this is awesome.
YES MORE PLEASE!
My eyes are severely sweating??
“It’s quite a Metropolen place”

My little heart can only handle so much Andrew Q - Q
Yep.  I cried.
Thank you Babish for being such a great person, helping others learn how to cook and helping people believe in themselves.
How have 34 people disliked this? YOU HAVE NO SOULS!!!
SO SO SO SO MUCH LOVE IN ONE VIDEO. 💕
We stan a good man
this needs more views.
Damn you’re a real one for this babbish. Foreal bro. Nothin but respect for you bro.
The bald man back at it again with the wholesome videos
I already loved watching your cooking and stuff when I was feeling down but this. THIS. Please don’t ever go away, Babish.
Such kindness 🥰
This was beautiful.
Apparently I needed that cry. 


Damn onion-cutting ninjas...
I,,,,, holy cow
I just wanna know who the heck disliked this vid?
It is so nice to see and feel those reactions from the people you or I help.  I can't say there is a feeling anymore rewarding than seeing someone who truly appreciates what you do or have done for them. I miss that these days.  I have always helped out people where I could when I learned there is something I can help them with. These days however I find myself in the situation of being the one in need and continuing to work harder and harder to get out of the hole I have found myself in. I learned a lot getting into the hole and got rid of the cause of the hole but now trying to climb out is a serious struggle.  I am hoping that I don't lose my home in the near future thanks to what I believe is intentional miss steps by the mortgage company in an effort to reclaim the home.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful experience with all of us. I so need to learn how to do all this youtube stuff. I can't say it would solve my problems but learning, growing and finding new ways to make an income sure wouldn't hurt.
this is so damn sweet
Sorry David, this is a christian Minecraft server, you actually shouldn't be swearing.
im so happy with this please do 100000 more
I like this feel good vid👍🏼
That was amazing
darn I want to be Andrew's girlfriend, wife and lover
Babby and Vinny! Glad to see where Vinny ended up. What a cool new series.
This is great
3:37 is babish 💃  to jennie's solo?
Damn ghosts cutting onions, they got to me.
I’m not crying, you’re crying :,)
This video makes you wish there was a super like button on youtube. Epic video !!!
THIS IS SO WHOLESOME
It's exceptionally brave to ride a vespa for the first time in Orlando. Might be one of the most dangerous places on earth to try that out.
this is the most wholesome thing ever
iissssaaaa scooter shop.
Babish is probably the coolest chef and person onYouTube!!
Wow what a glow up
To the 472 people that disliked this video? You have no heart.
Great way for babish to use his resources. Love this video and the first choice of a subject and person is a great and thoughtful choice.  And to the the around 400+ people that actually found it in themselves to thumbs down this video,  I cordially invite you to jump off a high bridge into shallow water, because if you have nothing else better to do than sh** on the hard work of a good guy and the meaningful story of a thoughtful person than the least you deserve is to realize what a empty and removed from what it means to be human person you are.
Dude!!!
This got me crying
Enjoy seeing you out on the road.  Cheers.
Humanity is still alive, I wish more people would give back.. You’re a true inspiration 🙏🙏🙏
This is helping restore my faith in humanity. You guys are awesome!!
this is so pure. this goes so much deeper than cooking and i love it. good job. ❤️
Onion cutting ninja's!!!!
I'm not crying. You're crying
That's as wholesome as it can be
A small amount of my faith in humanity has been restored.
the way you use your platform is actually heartwarming. Bless you good sir.
I love this 😭❤️
I love this and you!
And no glasses
Sir why did you have to make me cry?
I adored Andrew before but you just melted my heart like that cheese in your beautiful quiche.
so heartwarming. I hope you have great success in this new show Babish.
I subscribe for fun pop culture recipes, not to cry and have snot running out my nose but here we are.
Wait, Macs are good for Minecraft?
what both of u are doing is making this world a little more beautiful every day
"IT'S A SCOOTER SHOP BABY!" This is so wholesome!!!!! Great work man, you're amazing
he wore the apron to disneyland 😂
This is one of the most wholesome things I have watched on a long time
it's a scooter shop
the simple things
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING!  :'(

Best.  Bromance.  Ever.
Stal is bad, Ant
You are awesome man
Who the actual hell would "dislike" this video?!!?
You look better bald.
Babby my boy, I'm in tears. Such a good boy, a pure boy. Keep doing what you're doing you pure good boy.
Guys I dont think babish likes Florida
Owwww my heart 😭
THIS VIDEO IS TOO ADORABLE!
You're Ellen-ing? 
Incredible
Your doing great sis, keep going!
Babish seems like the most nicest, genuine bloke bloke ever
This is awesome.
Damn you tears. Get back in my eyes.
WOW! This is AMAZING! I can not believe people hit the dislike button on this...... Keep it Babish, giving back and changing people's life is good karma for all.
It's a scooter shop
🤗🤗👍👍👍👍👍✌️✌️
cut the camera-
videos like this gets me up in the morning.
Holy shit I almost teared up. This has gotta be the most wholesome thing I've ever seen. You're a saint Andrew. <3
I laughed so hard when they got on the scooter togther
This... this is what kindness is. The world may be scary and sometimes life hurts, but there is still beauty and love in it.
Dude! You're in Winter Park. I live there! Next time hit me up so I can take you around to some local spots!
Binging with babbish new mister beast
i cannot stress this enough but ITS A SCOOTER SHOP BAAABBBBYYY
Just wanted to let you guys know I'm hearing y'all loud and clear - very sorry I omitted the original recipe from the game! I was short on time when I shot this last week, and figured it was so full of crazy/toxic ingredients, I should just skip it. I'mma do my best to include accurate renditions in future episodes before I go into the 'Babish' version!
The true Portal cake is a Black Forest cake from the Regent bakery in Bellevue, Washington. Close to Valve's HQ and is where Valve bought the cake for reference.
Also hey, you seem kinda stressed dude. Just remember we love the show and care about not just the food but the presenter too ;) Keep up the good work, all the best ❤️
> By which we will remove the stems and divide by half.
> There's gotta be a more human way to say this; I took off the stems and then cut them in half
2 seconds later
> Sospin
You forgot the most important ingredient of all... love 🙂
Portal:Explains what cake it is
Babish: I D0nT ThInk sO BuDDY
Where's the damn fish shaped dirt!?
Make the tiny calzones from Parks and recreation (minus the food poisoning)
I don’t get why so many people are out raged by him not following the “official” recipe. I’ll have to look up everything so expect some edits, so I’ll try to list all of the toxic ingredients
polyester resin causes irritation to the respiratory system and can be deadly if not in a well ventilated area
ethylbenzene causes irritation to the eyes and is damaging to the central nervous system
Do the Italian food from jojos bizarre adventure, diamond is unbreakable
1:39

‘No chemical-‘

Me: No fish-shaped ethlbenzene?
Pls dont play with my feelings. Pls dont let the cake be a lie
I think babish should be selling babish tiny whisks...It just feels right.
Unpopular opinion: Whipped cream frosting is better than buttercream frosting
"Decorate our cake with eight whatever these things are called, little flower blossoms." 
makes nine little flower blossoms babish you liar
Can we get kitty’s anything from That 70s Show?
Binging with Babish: Cooking

Whisk: I’m about to end this man’s whole career

Edit: End
shouldnt you usually dam with frosting a cake before putting the filling in? it usually prevents that filling spillover.
my granny always makes the filling with the dark cherrys you put on top and use the other glossy ones for the topping (and i think thats the right way because i never seen it the other way around :D) - greetings from germany
You did good making it three layers because the slice of cake shown during the credits was three layers
you should've made this for april fools then proceed to destroy the cake
The cake in the game was actually based on a Black Forest cake from a nearby bakery to the Valve office!
Babish should make the death kwon do sandwiches from regular show
Don't really think I wanna cut the cake with a lit candle so make a wish even though it's not my Birthday....OW.......that's what I get for makeing a wish even though it's not my birthday

DID THIS MAKE ANYONE ELSE DIE OF LAUGHTER
I love your videos and yes, it is interesting to watch your attempts to cook food according to the original recipe but those 'fans' should take a second before complaining. I mean some ingredients where just plain garbage or even toxic! Better skipping the recipe instead of wasting resources...
9/10, needs more fish shaped...stuff
The only time babish could make the sandvich from tf2, would be on April 1st
Make the Broodwich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
“I don’t wanna cut this with lit candle, so I’m gonna make a wish even though it’s not my birthday”
proceeds to take out the candle with bare hands
“OW! that’s what I get to make a wish when it’s not my birthday”

All in that monotonous voice! LOLOLOL🤣🤣🤣
Please do Aunt Hilda’s Truth Cake from Chilling Adventures of Sabrina The Teenage Witch!
As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you. When the testing is over, you will be missed.
The other guys name is Vinny. HE TOOK VINNY FROM BRAD
Never realised that the Great British Bake-off made it over to the US...
First layer: im slitting us up
Second layer: fine!

Two minutes later...

MARRAGE!
This was a triumph. I'm making a note here huge success. Its hard to overstate my satisfaction.
Next: The Sandvich from Team Fortress 2 (Valve theme)
Im extremely disappointed. Was excited to see your use of fish shaped solid waste. Now im back to not knowing what to use my fish shaped solid waste for
Thats regular Schwarzwälder Kirsch Torte a German cake
Okay, but fake recipie from the robot aside, there is an ACTUAL cake recipe hidden in the game. I don't remember where exactly, but it's hidden somewhere.
That's the least brown/dark black forest cake I've ever seen, yet.
hey there! Fun fact, the cake in game is actually originally from a bakery nearby to Valve HQ in Bellevue, Washington. The devs at Valve loved it so much that when they needed  the cake as a plot point, they added it to the game!
lack of GLaDOS sarcasm and dry humour. π/10
mmmm.... upper-crotch-area shaved chocolate. just like mom used to make
Can you make your take on the Wavy Pringle’s 😭💀
You should try the "Gateau from the Chateau" from the BBC comedy "'Allo 'Allo."
You should make the Black ink spaghetti from JoJo's bizarre adventure
So what can be said about this episode?

/...This was a Triumph/
/I'm making a note here: Huge Success/
/It's hard to overstate my satisfaction/
Everyone British ever: Oh my God he said 'aluminium' correctly
Idk why I thought of a nether portal when I read the title.

Do Heavy's sandvich from Team Fortress 2
Didn’t the recipe call for “Solid Waste”?
This channel needs more crotch chocolate
Babish : "I started whisking."
Me : "NUUUUHHHHHHHH !!!"

Joking aside this is the equivalent of trying to woodcarve a ballerina with a chainsaw ^^"
The Kirsch you got must've been bad, because where I come from Kirschschnapps is super different depending on the brand.
Anyway, this cake is great.

It’s so delicious and moist.
IT’S NO LONGER A LIE.

And it only took us 12 years to get what we were promised
Portal!!
Make the BBQ sauce from plant terror already!!!
"Kirsch" just means "cherry". What you're using is "Kirschwasser", translating to "cherry water" and referring to Kirschschnaps.
Babish: There has to be a more human way of saying  that...

Me: good job BabishBot.exe you're finally learning...

BabishBot.exe: and them im putting them in a medium saucepin..

Me: welp, back to the drawing board.
Please please make super hot ranch-flavored nacho blasters from Johnny Test
While this is a good and tasty looking facsimile, the actual recipe for the Portal cake (which was based on a cake made at a local Seattle bakery) is listed in the game on computer monitors, and can also be found on the Portal Wikia. I'm sure you can't go wrong either way, but the option is there for those seeking the most authentic experience.
Make a collab with @JerryRigEverything
Jk you're the same person judging by the voice
Love your uploads!

Can you do either the New Year Soba or the Hot Pot + Zosui (or any of the other dishes made) from Today's Menu for the Emiya Family?
This party is great but I wish we could find the gamers
smirk
This cake is sooooo good
THE CAKE IS A LIE
Like your videos, but I liked when you would make the food from the original recipe and then put your own spin on it to make it taste good.
Kind of glad that you skipped the fish shaped volatile organic compounds and sediment-shaped sediment...
Ichiraku Ramen from Naruto! Love the episodes keep up the awesome work, never a boring watch with you man!
It's funny to hear you saying Kirsch tastes like fake cherry, although the single and only ingredient - apart from water to balance the alcohol level - are cherries.
I for one am looking forward to the upcoming love triangle between Babish, Vinny, and Brad.
Sleeves rolled 97% perfect today. Disappointing.
You should collab with one of the competitive eaters on YouTube if you make a big meal

Hey Babish! You should do the Fish and Chips from the Chronicles of Narnia! I know you can make a better version of it lol
you have come, SO far from since I first saw this channel Babish, and I just want to say I'm insanely proud of you and everything you've accomplished up to this point, and I'm absolutely going to be here until the end. KEEP GOING UP BROTHER.
Heck yeah portal coming in 2019 yes I love that game
I kind of miss when you would try the recipe given in the game/movie, prove it's terrible, and then do the actual recipe. That's where half the fun is! With this one you cut out half of the show!
Ukrainian version of this cake called “Drunk cherry”.
And is my favorite cake!!
The cake is a lie
Also remember to wash and iron your apron between making the chocolate shavings and sprinkling them on the cake.
Babish ate the cake: Perfect
Rhett, Link and Jack ate the cake: Disgusted
Trailer for the new show at the end of today's episode!  Being with Babish premieres right here, this Friday, March 22nd!
The greatest thing about this whole recipe is the omission of coconut. Bless you, my good sir, for sparing me the ingredient I revile above all others.

The other greatest thing, is that you saw there was no point crying over every mistake. You just kept on trying until you ran out of made your cake
"Kirschschnapps" or "Kirsch-..." literally means "Cherry-..."
I am SUPER excited for Friday.
"Being with Babish" is all I've ever dreamed of.
Also, nice cake. Looks tasty.
i always had black forest cakes for my bday since its my favorite cake recipe so im overjoyed of seeing someone like you make one :D


Edit: Kirsch isnt disgusting its amazing if i could down a bottle each day i would! (this is probably since i got german (from the black forest region) heritage lol)
Edit2:  you fixed your own error :D and make up your mind godamnit XD
"But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
"

I feel like that mistake was planned.
Love your vids.
The swirls on top are called rosettes.
You should do food from Team Fortress 2 in the future, since you just did a Valve recipe
Hey Andrew, ever thought of doing the food from Studio Ghibli movies. They always look so amazing.
Would you consider making Sojiro's Curry from Persona 5? Washed down with some coffee, of course!
By the way it‘s called: „Kirschwasser“ which means cherry-water. It‘s basically distilled alcohol made from cherries.
Please do sanji's cooking at navy !!! From one piece!!!!!!!

You should do the fancy feast from Courage the cowardly dogs episode “watch the birdies”!
Hey Babish could you make a sweet roll from The Elder Scrolls: V Skyrim?
Ive always wondered how does the pie from " I Robot " taste like, or what is the recipe :3
SCHARFENBURGER Yeeeesss
You know your chocolate sir
4:32
Trailer looks awesome hard honest work from you guys. Luv It!
Maybe try using Luxardo cherry liquor instead. Probably tastes a lot better! Also, “scrummy”
Damnit Babish, where’s the fish-shaped crackers, candies, solid waste, dirt, and ethylbenzene?!
But in all seriousness, ya should’ve at least put fish-shaped crackers and fish-shaped candies!
You ain't a dessert chef man... But it okay 😂
YES 
that is how you say the great british bake off!
Blackforrest Ghetto: You're in the wrong wood!
Thank you for making this! portal is one of my favorite games and it was really cool seeing you make this

The Cake is a Lie, Trust Only in Pie
"I have to stop you there.  I'm allergic to coconut.  I don't want any of the cake."
...but why didn't you make the in-game recipe first and THEN make the look accurate version?

I would love to see someone actually try to make a cake with the ingredients the cake robot gives you, like just watching someone try to peel licorice would be amazing
You are particularly clever 
In this episode. I like it.
I remember looking up "whipped cream frosting recipe" for like half an hour and thinking "is it really just whipped cream?"
What happened to making things following the original recipe before trying to make it taste good?
You should try your hand at recipes from Like Water for Chocolate. I was rewatching it the other day and thought of trying some
You should try to make the Broodwich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
No stabiliser in the cream?, ooooh man your playing with fire!
Could you do the Hibachi dinner from Beverly Hills Ninja?
Not gonna lie. I wish he would have made a "game accurate" version first, then made the delicious one. It's fun to see the comparison like in the always sunny video.

Please do Archer's Season 7 Episode 5's World's Most Expensive Mc10:35
I love that you always include your own failings and explain what went wrong. Makes it much more relatable and increases understanding of the process. Thanks!
What kind of cherries are they? They are really clear it is odd.

I would love to see you making ichirakus Ramen from Naruto
Please do a Good Burger episode. A Good Burger with Ed's Sauce
You mentioned the great british bake-off, then you say aluminium.
For a guy who made Milk Steak I'm pretty disappointed that this didn't follow the recipe in the game.
It is #16 on trending!

Make the pizza bagel from Steven universe or the French fries

You really need to do the MLT (mutton lettuce and tomato) sandwich from ‘the princess bride’

I will forever enjoy your show. Absolutely my favorite cooking show of all time.
This was a triumph
I'm making a note here, HUGE SUCCESS
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
tbh i thought the cake in game was coated with shaved almonds
2:24 "medium Sospin"
GLaDOS approves. You will not be sent to the neurotoxin chamber
You should do the Chiffon wedding cake from One Piece.
everyone: saucepan
Babish: SAUCEPN
Philistine! Banause! Don't knock our rich tradition of taking sour fruit and turning them into delicious clear alcohol. Calling Kirschwasser fake-cherry tasting, when it's made of nothing but real cherries is just slander!

You probably forgot how real cherries smell with all the synthetic aromatics that are presumably in everything cherry-flavored in the US. Or maybe don't buy bottom shelf alcohol.
Omg can you make a sandwich from wizards of waverly place 😂
Hey, i don't know exactly what you used, but real 'Kirschwasser' is not synthetic and i wouldnt call the taste 'fake'. But it is like with any single malt or anything else, you need a good one.
Do foods from Log Horizon! great show and great looking food.
I like how Babby has gradually removed all the vowels from the word “saucepan”
Should have called it " Breaking Babish "
Omg why do I have the biggest crush on you ❤️ 😆
Watching binging with babish always makes me want him to have a collaboration with Jun's Kitchen lol

*a harmony of western and asian
this was easily the most hilarious episode you've ever done.
I hope you still let Vinny and Brad have play dates
🤣😂🤣😂 LMAO... I needed that. Thx
Do foods from the game Kingdom Come or The Elder Scrolls!
“Don’t half ass many things, whole ass one thing” learned that from Ron freaking Swanson
I like how you snuck in that "aluminum" pronunciation so casually 🤝
"Into my upper crotch area" 
Mom: What the heck are you watching?
i don't know if you take suggestions, but you should make the Super Shaggy Sandwich from "Scooby-Doo where are you?"
I don't have a mixer or processor. Would I still be able to make this, albeit manually?
I love that you pronounce aluminium properly 👍🏽🖤
Should try the mayo 7 layer salad from how I met your mother! 🤣
Upper Crotch Shaved Chocolate.  Delightful.
The length of the video is perfect 👌🏻 69
Its great to see Babish making household name for himself outside youtube. I remember when he was at only 200k subs. They grow up so quick
im sorry- did you say- im sorry but- al-you-min-E-yum?  aluminum?? w h a t
I'd love to see you make the (extremely) spicy mapo tofu from Angel Beats, and/or the moon pies from Avatar The Last Airbender :D
Make Scooby snacks, the sandvich from Team Fortress, or the rations from Half-Life
Yo babish ive been watching you for a couple of week and i love you vid i wish you'd do another asmr, thought it was funny last time you tried😂👌
Do the ribs from NORBIT next (church / wedding scene)
You should do a follow-up episode where you do the recipe that the "recipe ball" said, it would be really fun to see how it turns out.
you know Babish means business when he tosses a Yeti duffel cooler into a Jeep Wranlger. Lets go!
02:48: Aluminium. Are You Even American Anymore?
Did anyone hear how he pronounced sauce pan? 😂
I've had a fever of 104 and rising for the past few hours and Binging with Babish is the only thing that's kept me sane, and able to focus on anything but how miserable I feel. Thanks, bud!
No fish-shaped ethyl-benzene = 0/10
No Ethyl benzine, 10/10
you didn’t actually make the cake from the game tho????
Ah yes, good ol' Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte with Kirschwasser. :)
UGH! DAMN IT!!!!! I thought it was gonna be a cool as cake with a portal into another dimension 😭
كيكه فاشله 😂😂😂
Make benson’s microwave wings from regular show
Wait, Vinnie?! As in Brad's Vinnie?!

That sounds wrong when said out loud, but I stand by the question.
maybe Okuyasu's meal from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure?
How about lighting nachos from Ok KO let's be heroes
The fluff was a lie. Also if you didnt learn how to bake from the great British bake off... you would be some kind of magician.
I hate Kirschwasser, but somehow my German sensibilities are still offended. 

Beautiful work, though.
Hey Babish, I know you got a lot going on but if you want to test your skills on another anime food I suggest the Curry Buns from Black Butler. Been dying to see someone do an accurate recreation using the unique curry recipe.
Calling Kirsch fake tasting (the real kind is made from cherries and nothing else...) while filling your cake with some neon pink stuff you call cherries? Really, Babish, you can do better. ;)
Maybe take a trip to the Black Forest this summer?
Can you do bensons hot wing chili from regular show
Great food, and great looking man making them💯
No fish shaped candies/crackers?
Babish, you monster
The MANWICH from futurama :)
Hey banish I think your great and I think a homemade hot pocket would be cool if you made it
I agree Kirsch is pretty disgusting, but it works in Black Forrest Gateaux and it's actually really good when you make cheese fondue, since a spirit is needed to liquidate the cheese. 😊
Babish have you seen the GBBO (great British bake off) celebrity with a comedian James Acaster ? Imagine he’s someone you’d find hilarious
"But there's no sense crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake

Congratulations on the new show! :)
I tried to make this cake, but I think I overworked the batter once I added the dry ingredients. It was really tasty but tough.
Great work on the cake! Have you ever considered making the Cinnamon Pie from the episode "Dual Spires" on Psych?
Yall mind if i throw in a old meme real quick?

The cake is real!
Pls make the sandvich from tf2
The portal cake is so iconic that I must have totally dreamed that I had already seen you make it!
this was a triumph. I'm making a note here, huge success.
You should make the sandvich from tf2
He said aluminium correctly bravo
THIS VIDEO IS A LIE
There’s a recipe in a Scott Pilgrim comic called Vegan’s Shepard Pie. It’s in Scott Pilgrim vs. the world volume 2.
i know your krabby patty episode was like a year ago but there was an episode that came out in 09 that gave more specific details like having the grill at 274 degrees and having the patty cook for 283 seconds per side. 

you probably won’t see this but i know you go for accuracy and thought i’d mention that
Your show comes out on my birthday!
March 22

Yah beard is soo bootiful  (srry I just love beards)
You don't need to know this, but I have to tell you that it makes me unreasonably happy when you say "saucep'n".

As a german:
1st: Kirschwasser is delicious, I don't know what you got there, but if it tastes like 'fake cherry' it is not real german Kirschwasser.
2nd: You switch the cherries. 'Saure Cherry' into the cake and if you have to, you put the devil's cherries as decoration on top.

That’s what I get for making a wish when it’s not my birthday
ROFL
can we call cakes with whipped cream antibabish cakes because Babish is the God of cooking
I would personally love to see your take on foods from Avatar the Last Airbender!  Some I have in mind are fire flakes, the little dough people (edible raw, of course), and cabbage cookies.  If you need an idea, I recommend going wild with some new recipes!
Make the cake from Minecraft
Make ichiraku Ramen from Naruto
Those “flower blossoms” are called dollops.

The cake is a lie!!!
There is a special place in hell for the person who invented genoise sponge.
You should make all the craft-able food from Minecraft
2:24 saucePEN
its funny that there is an english word like black forest for this cake, because the german name might be the hardest cobination of letters for an english speaking person to pronounce: Schwarzwälderkirschtorte
I thought it would be something portaly, but it was just a normal cake.
This was a triumph!
The cake is a lie, but the sarcasm this episode is real
Try making your own recipe
"Being with Babish" sounds like we're dating and I'm not mad at it.

Binging with Babish lied
See the Babish

Binge the Babish

BE THE BABISH
It's,,,,, a lie
But I thought it was a lie, the game lied about it being a lie
You should try to make the cake from the N64 Paper Mario. I think Twink reads the bulk of a recipe for a Special Strawberry Cake.
Vincenzo and Brad 😢
New show looks dope!
wait, that's illegal a lie
This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.
BEING WITH BABISH LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING I’VE EVER WANTED
FISH SHAPED
0:18 Mom said it's my turn on the xbox
This was a triumph, I'm making a note here, huge success
If Kirschwasser is from artificial cherry aroma, it s not a good Kirschwasser. It was used since the 19th century for schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, and I don t believe it was made from Aroma back then. And if you get a good one, it still isn't today. And initially, the cake was made without alcohol :D
Gamers rise up
Somthing tells me this is a trap
This was a triumph.
Oh god nostalgia.
Who else thought it was ground beef in the thumbnail?
Could we get the burger he actually wanted from falling down?
This was a triumph.
You are now banned in the UK.
Make Chocolate pie from The Help
Can you make the medic cake from TF2? (TeamFortress 2)
You should do some of the food from Izombie
No! The Cake Is A Lie!!
Hey babish i have a suggestion. In the Anime JoJos bizaare adventure in the fourth part theres an episode where 2 of the main characters visit a resturaunt where the food dramatically helps their health but its scary while the transformation goes on. Not gonna ask you to watch all of jojo cause thatll take forever but its a good show and theres one recipe with cheese and tomato that looks really friggin good
This was a triumph.
I actually love whipped cream frosted cakes the best since frosting is usually too sweet for me. this works out when people don't like it because then I get a whole cake
PLEASE DO BROWNIES
Gotta say I'm disappointed with most of your recent videos, I know you've addressed it already but you have to really go back to the bare bones of why people found your channel unique from the get go. Here's an idea, do the original gross cake with some people who eat nasty food - like Rhett and Link! 
Here's hoping your next video will be better.
This is so cool!
saucepin.
For once its not a lie😂
Alexa!...
“Saucepen”?
When you cook cakes and pastries, you should call it "Baking with Babish"
Kirsch is not a brandy
You should make the chicken Leeloo "hydrates" in The Fifth Element towards the beginning of the movie!
Don't know if you've seen it but it'd be ICONIC if you did Smithy's Indian takeaway from Gavin and Stacey...
...Idk man. You have skills AND a cult of personality but I ha...no.. am apprehensive to see you going the VLOG route that you seem to be going with the new show. I hope that the regular Binging with Babish doesn't take a back seat for this.

Is it a vlog I’m so confused
It's a lie tho...... The cake it's a... the cake is a lie
This is not a Black Forest Cake. The first layer is only cherries, no cream. The next two layers are whipped cream without any cherries or Kirsch. And the chocolate should only cover the sides, not the top. And usually the cake is a lot darker.
And what is wrong with whipped cream as frosting? Honestly tastes much better and lighter than butter with powdered sugar.

Bit of an americanised version of a Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte but I'll accept it.
... Liar
The cake is a lie
Like 😍
My mom makes this cake for my birthday every year and drives up to my place to drop it off! My recommendation for how to make it truly the best is to add some of the kirsch to the whipped cream. It's helps add a little something more complex to the whipped cream other than just the sweetness from the sugar. Highly recommend it!

It's not a black forest gateau. The cake is a lie.
Upper crotch area....
4:36 Babish screwing a chocolate bar...
“Kirsch” actually just translates to cherry. The liquor is called “Kirschwasser” (cherry water). And yeah, it’s indeed disgusting.
Not sure if you’re still checking comments on this video but I figured I’d try since this is your most recent!
I have a couple of suggestions for future videos, some that have definitely been mentioned by other commenters too

- the iconic huge sandwich scooby doo and shaggy make (and leave behind) while running from monsters
- studio ghibli food (I know this one has been asked for a lot and there may be copyright issues or something, again these are just suggestions)
- the best burger in New York from How I Met Your Mother (tbh a lot of food in HIMYM might be suitable for this)
- stardew valley recipes would be really fun to see what you improvise with since they all have minimal ingredients
- the fussy cakes and meals from the Marie Antoinette movie

Thanks, I really love these videos and you seem like such a nice person
You tried so hard to laugh when you flip the whipped cream
Vinny pls go back to brad
for april fools you should make a video in the style of howtobasic

Ah... the Cake from portal just looks delicious!
But i'm scared to even eat it because that cake core's description of it at the end of the ingredients gave me the chills
This game touched the deepest part of my memory 😂
Didnt know Rochester wasn't in the US (Aluminiuuuuuu,)
Looking forward to the new show
Shouldn't have watched this so late. Now I'm hungry.

You're also a "Wüstof-Pro bro"!?!

Though I haven't noticed you using them before; so I'm not certain I should be jumping to conclusions.
Either way, I hope you keep it up with the infotaining videos.
Great Video as always. Kirsch, however, does not have to entail a "fake cherry taste". All fruit brandies/schnappses can taste quite delicious if they are made properly. Go ahead and buy some real stuff :D
2:25 medium SOSPIN!!
Is bake off on Netflix or something how does everyone about it ? 🤔
I've never played portal, so I don't care about if it was made from the original recipe or not. That black forest cake looked delicious.
I messaged u on messenger and wanted to give u a recipe idea to do for the video and you didn't even bother to reply what a loser.
I literally only clicked into this video because i thought based on the title and the description that you were making it with the original described ingredients. While i get some things might not be obtainable or to toxic to touch, but no one said you had to eat it. I guess the Cake really is a lie.
Can we get some food from the big bang theory

If you frost your cake with anything besides whipped cream, you're wrong. 


Don't @ me.
Ayyy being with babish is coming out on my birthday... awesome.
The cake wasn't lie after all
But is it a lie..?
This video is gonna get demonetized for being a lie.
Some peak Babish humour in here !! :)
The cake is a lie.
I'll post this A. because I think it's a neat idea, and B. because this is also a video game video. You should visit some of "Tayce T.'s" Recipes from the Nintendo 64 game Paper Mario. The maximum amount of ingredients is quite literally 2, minimum one, but the name of the dishes and idea behind them is no doubt something you could have fun with. For example: a "Yoshi cookie" that uses Melon.
Yes Babish, it is a Black Forest cake. The recipe is hidden in game and also the devs have talked about this before
I wish I was good at something and had a (likable) personality.
Well done Mr. Babish, it's been great following this channel and watching it grow at an immense pace, well deserved!
you should make the krusty krab pizza from sponge bob
I love the way you say "saucepin", and the trailer for your new show was epic :)
You forgot the 20-foot thick impermeable clay layer!
How about the tier three meal from Monster Hunter World?  I would LOVE to see you make something as insane as that.
FINALLY YESSSSSS THANK GLADOS YES
@BingingWithBabish
As I've been working in the kitchen for the last 2 years, but had never had resources to buy some great ingredients ... Therefore, I LOVE YOUR SHOW... Could you try a pigeon recipe from 'Burnt' with Bradley Cooper?.. You could start the video with the scene of you opening an oyster...
Awesome video. Please can you attempt cheeseburger meatloaf from the Goldbergs
You should make the “Welcome Home” cake, the evil mom gives Coraline from Coraline
Recently a newer episode of Bob's Burgers (S9E16 Roamin' Bob-iday) featured a restaurant 'Patricia's 77 Sandwiches.' They list several throughout the episode and during the end credit song. You should try to re-create (or put your own spin on) some of Patricia's 77 Sandwiches from Bob's Burgers <3

Binging with babish . We do what we must because the memes. For the good of all of us except the ones who are fed.... But there's no sense crying over ever mistake you just keep on trying till you run out of cake and the cooking gets done and you make a neat lunch for the people who are still alive
So what you're telling me is that since this is NOT the cake from portal... The cake IS a lie.

I love portal and have played it a number of times and want this cake so much for my 21st this year and you've made a video and I'm so happy 😭
Is it me or are his voice overs have a lot of bass to it

So excited to see the new show!
I half expected this episode to be a troll and when he was meant to reveal the cake there was nothing and he would say “the cakes a lie” and the episode would end. 😂😂 kinda sad it wasn’t a big troll.
THE CAKE IS NOT A LIE

Let’s talk about how hot Babish is on that bike.
WHY DID YOU EAT THE CAKE??? EVERYONE KNOWS THE CAKE IS A LIE!!!!!
Going to ditto all the other comments saying I like seeing the painstakingly accurate recreations followed by better versions format. I feel like this was just a regular cooking video about a cake, rather than a faithful recreation of a specific fictional one.
The portal cake was never a lie. Glados clearly said, "First you get baked, then you get cake." You never went into the incinerator (Got baked) therefor by the terms of the agreement you never got cake.
Perfect timing I just beat the game again this week 😂
True Portal Fans will know that the recipe is actually a pretty ordinary recipe that you can find on the monitors throughout the game. GLADoS trolling aside, it looks pretty good.
I admire the patience and determination that Babish has if a recipe goes awry. Dusts himself off, grabs his trust tiny whisk and defeats the dragon deliciously.
Omg my favorite game, I love you Babish!!
"Medium saw-spin"
The thumbnail looked like it was canned corned beef formed into a cake.
Ay my man I want to...

Press my chocolate bar into your upper crotch area ;)

Sorry not sorry.

wait, vinny from its alive?
THAT is going to be my 2019 Birthday Cake, WOW... and the new show looks good, will have to check it out in a couple days.
You should do the Krusty Krab pizza
when the cake is a lie
The cake is a lie
Yummmmmmmm crotch chocolate
Sorry, but this is not a proper Schwarzwälder Kirsch Torte, as a German I tell you, it’s not the real deal
so... he’s not a baker
I thought he was describing a German chocolate cake. Chocolate cake + coconut pecan icing = German chocolate cake 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Make the dessert loaf from the last og
Now you have to do a pan galactic gargle blaster!
I actively winced when you mentioned Kirsch. Protip boys and girls, do not let anyone talk you into drinking that. Ever.
Was gonna do the good morning burger, but this seemed somehow...healthier?
Coconut cream pie from iCarly! The one spencer had to date the owner's daughter to get the recipe, since it was soo good
Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
Barely has to do with the video, but I love how Babish has made a running gag out of him not being able to pronounce "Worcestershire sauce" XD
I think you should make hazelnut soup from tangled
The narration is fun... that's the difference between this other recipe videos
Recipe was incorrect. A proper Ribwich is made with something smaller and with more legs.
"Hang on, I gotta take this half in the other room for..."Analysis""
Press "X" to suspicious
I made this recipe last night, the family loved it, I can tell I'm making this recipe all summer this year.
Subway currently has a McRib variant. It's super good.
I want to congrats this man for pronouncing « Worctfshersire Sauce » correctly
Please do the Double Glazed Apple Fritterz from Regular Show
I’ve always needed this in my life since I first saw it so many years ago
Hey! Your true to form version of the Ribwich isn't true!


The Ribs themself ask for the ingredient of "an animal with eight legs"
The ribwich is probably like the ones they sell at school which is just ground meat in the shape of ribs
When will you continue bubbas shrimp?
You should do the cheese jerky from Hannah Montana!!!
Yo babs. Try making the final meal from monster hunter world. Its unreal and I think you could make it work.
Babish you are great!
But the south asks you to pleas stop with the NYC liquid smoke convection oven BBQ. It's just wrong.
Sincerely The south.
Hey Babish, your videos are really bomb! I think if u listed the Ingredients below (including the preferred brand as a recommendation) it would be ever more amazing!
You didn't even slightly toast the bun you animal.
You know this guy is a professional when he doesn’t use the measuring cup for the sauce even when he tells us  all the accurate measurements of cups
Looks awesome but man that is a LOT of prep work.
Who tf can dislike this. It’s gold
"The animal whos meat we used for the burger is now extinct."
the pig???
"No, think smaller, and more legs."
Diablo sandwich and doctor pepper! And make it quick, I'm in a goddamn hurry! Smokey and the bandit.

Top 10 chefs Gordon Ramsey scared to diss
Love your show can u write ingredients in the description
0/10 no liquefied mystery meat
You should make the squid ink spaghetti from JoJo's bizarre adventure battle tendency
Didn't toast the bun? Didn't make a true bwb sandwich
The amount of extra work for real smoked ribs is a waste of time. The oven ribs are completely incredible by themselves.
I don't even cook but I watched his eggscellent challenge video(i love regular show) and just subbed
I mean this was false because the meat you used didn't come from something smaller with a lot more legs, also you didn't grind your meat into a pastey liquid and full a rib shaped mold with it!

I would like to suggest the Fire Salt Doughnuts from Steven Universe! I would love to see you make cake doughnuts from scratch frosting, then top that off with some homebrew Carolina Reaper infused Sea salt!
Do the Broodwich from Aqua Teen dude!
I see a gold Rolex Daytona, babish seems to do well

"We start with authentic, letter-graded meat...and process the hell out of it, till it's good enough for Krusty."
Krusty: "Try my new Krusty Ribwich. takes bite Mmm; I don't mind the taste!"

later

Krusty: "Look, about the Ribwich; there aren't gonna be any more. The animal we made 'em from is now extinct."
Homer: "The Pig?"
Otto: "The Cow?"
Krusty: "You're WAY off...think smaller...think MORE legs."
omg my request came through! or maybe someone else requested first for the ribwich but nice!

Edit: if you haven't already, another request from the simpsons, "Mother Nature Burger", "Good Morning Burger", and/or "Homer's childhood Chili Dog"
Babish: black strap molasses 
Also babish:*has a stroke* sauce
Can you just once, after saying "freshly grated pepper", afterwards say "pepper pepper" 

I do it in my head everytime, and it'd be so satisfying if you did it. Once. Like a tribute or whatever
This is not the greatest sandwich in the world.

This is just a tribute.
San Xian noodles from Flavors of Youth?
pudding cups from Dragon Ball Super or Spaghetti Nero De Seppia from Jojos Bizarre Adventure
I prefer Claire Saffitz's recipe from Bon Appetit for ribs - it's spectacular
0:16 seems like the opening to  Breaking Bad.
We’re cooking meth today, boys!!
So basically the McRib, also nice to see you've recoverd Babish 😄👌
You should make power sauce bars next.
You should make that Sandwich from Aqua Teen Hungerforce the Broodwhich or something like that 😂
Now, if Krustyland at Universal Studios served food this good...
This must be seasoned so well it’s oddly satisfying
Can you make Minnie's "chocolate" pie from The Help?
Ribwich sounds like Jewish Surname.
Since the animal used to make the Ribwich is now extinct (watch the episode), recreating it is impossible.
But this was a nice tribute.
Babish  
This the perfect time to bring up 
The bbq sauce from plant terror.
So dam good you can drink it

This Ribwich wasn't that unhealthy, shouldn't it have had an unholy amount of cholesterol or sugar if it made Homer's blood-sugar levels increase so colossally or the fact that it made him super fat in 3 seconds? lol jk. 


Loved the video, I  think you must've enjoyed that "analysis" in the other room, ey? - I know I would've, those look like some insane oven-cooked ribs... IN A ROLL!

I really think ribs "falling off the bone" is a common misconception. If they do this they've usually been taken too far and/or have been cooked with too much liquid. Ribs should be soft and should just hold to the bone.

If I might give some tips,  the easiest way to rip the lining isn't to start cutting at the end of the rib but instead to take a pairing knife and insert it under the lining along one of the bones (idealy in the middle) lift you knife, then grab the lining and pull it apart from the rib. As for the "de-boning", I'd suggest you push the bone instead of pulling it out. Imagine you're playing jenga with those ribs,  you need to free the bone before pulling it out. It's not fool-proof but it should prove more effective.

Easy way to get off membrane, start a butter knife under mem from the side in the middle of the rib rack til you can get your index finger under the mem and push finger thru to other side. Pull up, let rib weight do the work, will peel right off towards both ends. Takes about 10 seconds to do it all.

That mustard squirt. When are we going to invent a bottle with human-rectum technology that's able to send out what you want but hold back the thin liquids?
also I feel like it'd be neat to see homemade ground-pork rib-shaped patty which is what these usually are. For that matter, doing as Krusty said and using a meat with "more legs" (shrimp patty? I've had some lovely thai shrimp patties)

Babish, could you make Serpentors Pizza?  In the old G.I. Joe comic book,  Serpentor is seen telling the Dreadnoks about how he came up with fire roasted pizza during his stint as a roman general.  The dreadnoks were being reprimanded for serving him frozen pizza, and grape soda.  He instructed his army cooks to take some leftovers, put them together, and roast them over a fire.  It was left over goat meat, olive oil, olives,  and dry cheese,  over some type of pita bread.   Then Serpentor cooked it over an open fire, on some long tree branch.   Forget which issue number it is.  But would love to see you make a video of it.  And bring in some G.I. Joe fans to your channel in the process.   Hope you do requests.  Great video by the way. 🍕🍕🍕🍕👍😉👌🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕  Any comic shop owner could tell you which issue number it is.🍻🍺🍻🍺🍻🍺🍻🍺🍻🍺🍻

When you say "Ketchup" you should be more specific. It could mean Corn Syrup garbage. Try to show people how to get hold of real ketchup. Or how to make it themselves.
We need a 3D food printer for these kind of shows. Least for those of us with a very small kitchen.

I've cooked ribs in the oven before. Just seared them off, added sauce, covered tightly with aluminum, and threw them in the oven at 275 for apx 4 hours. Then uncovered, added more sauce, and raised to 475 for 5-8min or until it hits malliard reaction, let them cool for about 3minutes, done. Literally fall off the bone ribs.
i wish onions disappeared from the planet they are horrible crimes against sandwiches and humanity in general
Don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, "Spare Tire" Dixon.

And chef to chef I can see you know alottttttttt more then me and I've learned in the kitchen, there is ALWAYS room for improvement. You can never learn to much and that's why I love the chef life.

Anyone else watch this with no intention of cooking it at all? 😋
I dont know if you made this or not but i think you should try to do the dish from monster hunter world so have fun with it have a nice day😀
Modelo time?
I’m really needing something healthy, maybe some low carb smoothies, or healthy snacks
Blackstrap?
Think smaller, think more legs.
I wish you were my mother.

Can you make a fancy version of  the cheese jerky from Hannah Montana ?
This channel has to be renamed Food Porn.
I tried this recipe. Since I'm an uncultured swine who lives in the deep South, I couldn't get my hands on lapsang tea. What I did to substitute was soak black tea in more liquid smoke. Came out great.
drooling a river rn
Wait ist the ribwhich extinct
Am i the only one thinking babish would look like a girls wet dream with glasses im a guy but god damn this guy is our bain of existence
A better way, salt the meat not the rub.
I hate that word: "membrane."  It sends chills down my spine.
McRib
I need to get a tiny whisk for how often I see it used.
Is there a way to not put beer?

It's pronounced War-stir-sheer

I know that you're a chef, but that is a seriously unsafe way to chop that onion.

Who's here just wanting to know how to make this because its basically a mcrib
I only have one dumb question what do you do with all the food after you do the show probably eat it
Love your videos, excellent quality in every way. However, if I had one comment it would be to maybe make your depth of field a bit wider, the way it is not almost the entire shot seems to be out of focus. Slightly straining on the eyes. Or maybe I’m just going blind.
You should do an episode dedicated to the movie good burger. You could make  the mondo burger, Ed sauce, etc. I’d be very happy if you did that
Hey Babby! My McCormick black pepper can mentions using ground black pepper for chocolate cake and cookies. Is that a thing? Could you use that in a video?  Love your videos, never stop.
Do the double glazed donut from regular show

Think smaller, think more legs...
I know you recreate food from movies and occasionally TV, but would you consider this recipe from Jules Verne's 'Around the World in 80 Days'
"Mr. Foggs breakfast consisted of a side dish, a broiled fish with Reading suace, a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel of Cheshire cheese, the whole thing washed down with several cups of tea...'
Rub ur membrane
Mustard and ketchup?  Why not barbecue sauce?
Wonder if Babish will ever do a what watches he owns video?.
Wow, another Simpsons food... Do something new sheesh. This channel sucks after a year
People that are undergoing cancer treatment should watch babish's video's they make you wanna eat.... Like Really bad, they make eating SOMEHOW more enjoyable while watching, I almost always watch these videos while eating.
I would never cook for over an hour just for ketchup.
i feel like all that was needed was to put it on a hamburger bun instead of a sandwich roll

“Now without lettuce”
good video, but i had to watch an Amy Schumer add before it
As a Texan who really likes good ribs and uses dry rubs religiously. I will say to everyone that says liquid smoke is a cheap way of making BBQ, GFY!! I'm not going to wake up 5am every time I feel like making some BBQ for my 2 family members, who could care less why the meat taste so damn good.
Steam Ham
I want
WhatchyaMcCarcass Sandwich
I wanna be honest here, I never ever tasted alot of meat, my family grew up semi poorish and i never realy tasted any real meat part such as ribs or whole hogs or whatever shit happens.

we mostly ate chicken and minced meat, i myself have a good job that brings in a good ammount of money so i can acctually afford stuff like this, but the problem is, I cant cook at all. I eat really easy dishes because i cant cook, nor do i acctually want to spend time in the kitchen.

I bought a few ribs a few months ago and started fooling around with them, they looked nice and allright to eat so i did just that, the problem was tho, I did not like the texture in any way. pulling it off the bones made me even feel disgusting, the idea of me eating real things that grows on my own bones aswell made me feel really awkward and at a certain point i felt ready to threw up because of that. 

Now im not a vegetarian at all, and my "dish" looked kinda like yours (bit more meat on the bones not next to it and general stuff like that, yours look way more tender.) i did not like the meat at all, I know it wasnt done, I know i cant cook but i also know what i like. Does this mean I just generally dont like big hunks of meat next to the easy minced meat stuff? because ill be honest again, Minced meat, I love that shit! its so tasty with a bit of salt and pepper!

Im pretty new to trying out real food next to the easy "i have just 2 bucks to spare for dinner" thing and i acctually wanna try good food, but i do not have the time nor interest to learn to really really cook good.
Is it good?!
I feel like the recipe should be a lot simpler since it's technically fast food.
Don't forget to use a paper towel for gripping your membrane.
that watch is so distracting i didnt absorb anything i was just staring at ur watch the entire video
Please lose the watch u look gay
Yummmmm
Does it have to be a fancy beer
Just discovered Binging with Babish and all I have to say is Feast of Fiction is dead to me
Jalapenos would be good on that
I always consider Babish a purist trying to get as close as possible to the source material. And we all remember that the ribwich is made out of a now extinct animal that is smaller than a cow...with more legs...
You should do Gumbo and beignets from princess and the frog!
Just say you are making a rib sandwich, don’t clickbait with the simpsons then say it’s a tribute.
whats a "saucepn"?
Not like
Man, I remember back in days mcdonalds had this rib sandwich so good 😛
PLEASE MAKE KALKOLASH
broodwich
Probably could have just gotten a McRib from McDonalds. I think that’s what the show was making fun of.
I have a challenge... I think its a shrimp cake inside of an egg roll. As a Child, I ate at a place that served shrimp toast. As an adult, it was not shrimp toast and this place closed down 20 years ago. It was the best thing ever. it looked like an egg roll with the ends flattened down. the closest thing I've seen is a rolled shrimp toast. I assume it had pork in it.
You need to do some of the foods from the game Fallout, iguana on a stick, Nuka cola, I urge you to explore them because they are quite unique
Ahh, fantastic, Binging with Babish videos so I can watch videos about food as I eat microwaved hot dogs.
Amazing meat cooking skills

Eating raw onions though.. 😖
Sounds like Gordon Ramsay sticky ribs recipe 🤔🗿
"Then we're going to tiny whisk these guys together..." I NEED THAT TINY WHISK

Could you make dishes from the Sims?
You know you can make the chilli dog that sonic likes
This has literally nothing related to ribwich from the Simpsons. This is just a separate sandwich.
If no ribs are allowed why not use pork belly?
Tastes like liberty!
His baldness was the key ingredient
You got all those ingredients from a 2D cartoon?
WHERE WAS THE CROSS SECTION!!!
The only thing missing in this channel is how to make the b*tch lasagna. Pls babish, do your part!
Good burger from good burger
Do that hateful 8 Stu !!!!!!
Better make Steamed Hams
sounds like a yummy $200 sandwich
Make the eggplant burger from the scooby doo movie
Why didn’t u toast the bread
Hey Andrew, i think a series that features you making relatively hard recipes that needs special skills (like sushi and other not so familiar foods from different nations) would be very good

But can you do a kimbap or a bibimbap basics or binging with babish episode? 


Ps:im not really thinking enought to make a proper and not so “all over the place” sentence
mmmmm peng watch babish
I don’t care what people think about Jenna Marbles, Babish is THE BEST YouTuber from Rochester. Making the 585 proud, my man

You're probably not going to read this, but if by the off chance that you do I would love to see you make Tonio's Italian food from jojo's bizarre adventure.
I feel like you could channel a really good ZeFrank impression
aww, i was expected some grounded insects. since its made of an animal with 6 or more legs
All I could think of was Louie CK’s bootleg bit about buying a gold watch.

My favorite fictional food is Nami's ass from One Piece. Can you do a video on how to cook that?
..oh man, I wonder if this would be any good with vegetarian "ribs". Food allergies suck.
He made a MicRib from McDonald's.
Wasn’t the Ribwich made from multi-legged animals that are now extinct?  That makes yours not even close, and not sure why this video. Even the mcrib is made from organs held together with organic glue. You could have started there.

You should make Big Smoke’s order from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for the four million subscriber special.
Genius method for getting rid of all the leftover lapsang from the Phantom Thread episode
I'm guessing that it's also feasible to replace the lapsang tea sachets with some soaked wood chips. They would exhibit smoke and do basically the same job as the tea.
I had to change my draws three times 😜
To me that looked so delicious. I want to make it
I'm not gonna lie to ya but I made this sandwich and it was the best sandwich i ever had
I am in love
Did someome say broodwich?
Make the broodwich!
I always wanted to eat one.
Babish had unusually high amount of sexual innuendos in this episode. Not that I'm complaining...
God my mouth is watering
If you are reading this, make sure you keep on going for what ever it is you want. It will come. But if you have some extra time to watch one of me and my brothers newest video, If we don’t make you laugh you can dislike the video😇 God Bless.
I wonder if anyone sees my old comments

Dear Mr babish, it would be an honor if you could do an episode where you make homemade orange chicken due to I can't make it my self ((plz I'm broke)) also my great grandma is coming from Taiwan for the month and loves orange chicken ((I need that inheritance money)) sincerely your biggest fan.

Pepper pepper pepper
"At this point, I realized I wasn't making food from the show, but a tribute to food from the show." THIS QUOTE. This is everything that has been wrong with this show since the move to the new kitchen. Stop half-assing recipe attempts. If it makes good food, awesome, but that's not the point here. The more that this channel is just another cooking show, the less this brand means anything.
I’m so hungry:(
Tanzverbot?
Where’d you get that gold Rolex Daytona?
Thank you, sir. Love your show and I appreciate that you give credit to other shows when using techniques or recipes. Also, loved seeing you on What’s Eating Dan.

Didnt Krusty say the Ribwich has more legs.
Hey babish! You should try and re-create the 'Triple fried egg chilli and chutney sandwich' hangover cure from the comedy Red Dwarf! I've also been interested in whether it would work but im sure you could make a better version!
Do purple flurp from jimmy neutron
Remake a McDonalds burger
Looks good, even though I dont like condiments.

So you eat ribs... but with bread

Doesn't seem to be the healthiest of samiches.
Don’t think I didn’t notice that ice on your wrist Andrew
Love this show, I have faithfully recreated many of your dishes, I pray you don't die from diabetes.
Babbie cutting that onion gave me a big spook
I've fallen in love with a similar recipe, but instead of 2 hours in the oven, the ribs spend 19 minutes in a pressure cooker. It's the recipe that convinced me to buy a pressure cooker.
Can you make a chili with a Peruvian puff pepper?

 If you dont know what that is I'm sorry for your sad childhood.
Lord that sandwich looks dry as hell. Slather that baby with more sauce.
That's lot of condiments and spices man
Sometimes I don’t even watch to see you make the food but because you have a nice voice

Ever taste fish fingers and custard from doctor who?
Don’t ever say slather again, you animal
You have enough experience that you could probably be trusted to shave with that kitchen knife, but dear god did I fear for your finger tips at 2:53 . Camera perspective i'm sure.

That daytona though😍
This looks toooo good
Nice watch.... ;-)
So this is what kugo was watching
You looked like your eyebrows were burning off taking those ribs out

Say it with me now Babbi, Worcest- Worcestererer- Nope it's impossible.
You lost the opportunity to make smoked hams
Worchsjficjfhdre sauce
Horsefersure sauce
Babish is losing his charm from the beginning .. i enjoyed his show because he really follow or tries to follow exact recipes and than provide improved version. Now these days its becoming regular cooking show.  What a shame
So what's the point of the tea if barbeque sauce is going to to be added?
The ice is for the drinks, not your wrist babish...

AHHHH i was drooling just from the ribs themselves....now im hungry

Now make one using caterpillar meat.

You forgot the LSD and cocaine.
Yo babish, where'd you get that pan you used for the Barbecue sauce? I want it.
I attempted making this at home with some friends... it didnt go well
I like the video but i do have some problems still. As a texan I’m not a big fan if the idea of oven cooking bbq, and I recommend Tennessee style ribs for the recipe. I think with minor improvements this could be an amazing sandwich.
3:10 even tho you don’t hear it I still cringe
🤤🤤🤤
It’s 4:30 am and I’m starving watching this
steamed hams when?
Babbage... No, you made some killer ribs here, and I might even try this recipe someday, but if the food you make fails to even resemble the food your replicating then you didn't replicate it, what you made was the second part of the show where you make it better while honoring the spirit of the dish, it looks great probably tastes great but you could've made a more honest representation of the sandwich.
If you're going to do food from The Simpsons, you gotta do Khlau Kalash. Washed down with a delicious crab juice, of course.
I don’t even eat meat and I went “damn those look good”
Why do you always say, "add some blackstrap molasses for sweetness"? Are you joking?
SO MUCH BETTER THAN GORDON RAMSAY. HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE A TV SHOW?!?!???!!!!!??!????!!!
well the first step towards making a blender soup is to model and render the shape of the soup, then tweak some lighting and export it
Should of  called this one Blending With Babish
Why not go into the world of Korean food? You've gotten into so much asian food from Chinese, Japanese, and Indian dishes before, why not try a crack at Korean dishes? I recommend a korean movie called Extreme Job, it's got an interesting recipe for fried chicken. As a Korean myself I'm super interested in seeing you try some dishes from my home country.
Pro tip on the corn soup from an Iowan.  After you cut off the corn kernels, scrape the corn cob with the back of your knife to get most of the pulp out.  The majority of the sweet flavor and creamy consistency is in those remnants, especially if the corn is in season.  You won't have to add nearly as much cream or sugar.
After all, you are the Betty Boop of your tomato soup.
You are almost out of spices. You should make an episode showing how you buy and choose etc it will be great
You should make a Basics video on "sick foods" or "foods to eat when you're sick"
The tomato soup has me hyperventilating. I want to go to there.
Are you gonna be on Hot Ones anytime soon?
Wow, the first soup was very...

2:45 a solid cup of water is a cup of ice
HA!!!! I used the mayo on my grilled cheese trick for a while and most people think I'm weird!!
My little brother is allergic to dairy products, so I used margarine instead of butter. But when I made it for him he said "It feels wrong to eat this because how creamy it is" Definitely a good recipe to try at home
Please make your intro a bit quieter because it almost woke my entire neighborhood up, oh god I think I can hear my dad, oh no he’s gonna beat me abahdaaksnbd son lajsbsbbd dad. Nima please

The tomato soup reminds me a lot of salmorejo, which is like gazpacho except you blend tomatoes with olive oil and bread without cooking, and then eat cold topped with dices of serrano ham, olive oil and a bit of balsamic vinegar. This recipe brings so many great memories of Spain and makes me want to make comfort food right about now ^^ thank you so much for sharing it!
"Cook the bacon... to completion."

Arin and Dan giggling in the distance
Heyy, can you do the soup and sweetbreads ala Gusteau/special order from Ratatouille? Pretty please?
Babish the special thing about corn soup is the corn flavored water, try this and tell me what is better:
Boil the corn ears in hot water and save dat water, sauté the onions for 15-20 mins with butter until blonde, cut the corn out of the corn ears and put in the onions, add some of the sweet corny water (and stock if you want), add little bit of acidity to balance and add salt to enhance the flavor, blend, add more salt and vinegar if needed.
so youtube randomly unsubbed me from your channel...wtf youtube. Glad to be back though.

Also good homemade tomato soup sounds like heaven.
Gute Besserung, get well from germany. and a little tip. corn cream soup served best with some drops of pumpkin seed oil.
Thanks for the creaminess tip with the tomato soup. Great idea for all the vegans. Would love to see more vegan tips on your channel. Thanks again babish!
Simple yet effective, as always.

Nice background music, same artist as one of the signature songs in Brothers Green Eats videos. 
Has a bit of Nujabes style.

Sick babish’s voice is somehow even more amazing but hope you get better soon
THANK YOU!! I've been struggling to find my favourite foods dairy-free since I found out I was lactose intolerant - this tomato soup looks perfect. Thanks Babish!!!
Appreciating the effort in 1:50 Jalapeños.. hhhalapenos :)

First I read Bender soup, was expecting something from Futurama :D
Hope you feel better soon! Thanks for the video and your dedication! Always great content!
Great recipes, thanks!  I also like blended black bean soup with cumin & cilantro.  Yum!
You should mix soft salted butter with mayonnaise for your grill cheese
Hope you get well soon man 😁👌

Soup. Soup a-tasty, soup soup. A-spicy. Garlic and corriander. Chilly chowder! Crouton crouton! Crunchy friends in a liquid broth!
When it said blenders soup I thought he was talking about soup by Blender from "Futurama" 😂.... I'm so uncultured 😒😣
Oh my God that Tomato soup and grilled cheese looked amazing!
Soups? Good stuff, actually a soup idea I was gonna throw at you Babish was the Potage Magnifique recipe from skyrim. Makes a decently filling stew of sorts. Quite good <3
Make the chocolate whopper that Burger King did for April Fool's next😍
How many bowls would you say the amount of ingredients you listed for the elote soup would make?
The voice is extra deep in this one.
I gotta be honest Babish, I was expecting strong grilled cheese game from the guy that makes his own puff pastry.
Thanks for the non-dairy tips!
Was expecting a Blender (Futurama) Soup until I read Basics :$
2:50 Am I the only one who can't stop staring at that speck of tomato that flew out, and can't stop thinking of what happened to it afterwards...
Perfect! A soup video for flu season!

Hey Babish, quick question, can you use the bread/oil technique for the Elote soup as well? I have a dairy allergy so using cream really isn't an option for me. But I want to make sure I keep the flavors of the soup intact.

Thanks!
I've never been so excited about tomato soup before.  Love the grilled cheese croutons idea.  Thanks and feel better Andrew.
Everyone else at the end: oh my God it looks so good 
In my head:  you just ruined a perfectly good grilled cheese
Can you make Bender’s brunch from Futurama?
I thought it said bender soups from futurama




Speaking of which u should do some of benders dishes
He sounds sooo sick but normal lol but the beginning intro song sounds like laura Vitales from laura in the kitchen 😂💯
I have dyslexia. I initially read this as "Bender's Soup." Bender from Futurama of course, which made me think, "He's cooking with LSD?!"
Pro-tip: keep that top cracked on the blender or the soup will likely explode in your face. 

i'm still finding evidence of my black bean soup incident from nearly a year ago.
I need a grilled cheese sandwich.. NOW.... STAT!!!!
Italian Food from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Part 4 : Diamond is Unbreakable

As for a request, could you try making poffins and/or pokepuffs from the Pokemon series?
Apple snaps from fantastic Mr. fox ???????
"Let those flavors get to know each other."


Picture that.
Hahaha ate the hell outta that crust 🤣🤣
I have 3 requests:
*Pickled Plums: Little Witch Academia
*Ramen: Blade Runner 2049
*Sushi: Isle of Dogs
That Elote Soup sounds really good actually, definitely going to to try it at some point.
Grilled cheese croutons. Love it.
I am really grateful for these videos, i got to find so many new recipes thanks to them. And it also helped step up my cooking in terms of flavor, as some of the ways you prep your food also improved what i was cooking so far already.


And i am sure this won't be seen, but i hope you get well soon.
That tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons looks amazing!
it should've been tomato soup and car panini
Makes me want minestrone ... even though it's not a blender soup. Ooh or Tom Yum!
Nino would have made blender soup with an actual blender
grilled cheese croutons is one of the best things I have never thought of and I am definitely going to do that the next time I am sick, thank you.
my dude! please rest and take it easy when you're sick, youtube/subscribers can wait. feel better soon 🙏
Please do how to make a sandvich from Team Fortress 2.
I have no idea how many of your viewers will know this, but this instantly made me think you should try and make the foods from SuperMega, especially Ryan's soup
Simply basic. I see Babish, I click Like.
Gazpacho is the king of blender soups.
My college student self read the title as “Bender Soups”
Feel better soon! I love the grilled cheese croutons, genius move.
That grilled cheese crouton trick is so choice.
I want to suggest a third series for this channel. Babushka with Babish, where he either cooks traditional ethnic food or just food his mom used to make for him.
I love warming soups like a scotch broth nice with multi seed toast
Fun fact; this channel made me figure out how to cope with depression. My life has never been happier, and my tummy has never been more thankful.
Turns out that cooking while having a mental breakdown rlly brings family together like a charm lmao
Would you consider doing a video on uses for an immersion blender or is it essentially the same thing as a stand blender? I bought one a month ago but didn't really think that through! 🤔
Damn my dyslexia, I read this as Benders soup and got excited only to find blender soups Hahaha.
I'd love to see you do Meemaws brisket from Young Sheldon.
Cheese smoothie from zeek and Luther or stew from nacho libre

Make egg rolls from Incredibles 2
Pls do the recipe from opening scene of my best friend's wedding please!!!

I love the grilled cheese croutons. That's brilliant!
360p Club
Guinness beer cheese soup. Maybe with croutons. And would go great with a Ruben Sandwich!
You can still make it dairy free by adding dairy free heavy cream (like the Alpro one), and it will still be delicious 😋
I just yelled at my boyfriend about that tomato soup. That's the best thing I've ever seen.
better with olive oil than with butter (better for your heart)
If only there was a good Chicken Noodle soup recipe out there you could make to feel better.
Grilled cheese croutons is genius. Wish I thought of that.
I always get so excited when I’m at school to see that you uploaded so I can go buy the ingredients to make what you’re making
I misread the title as Bender's Soup, came here looking for a bowl of whiskey
Probably worth mentioning that "velvety smoothness" is best achieved with a high quality blender. The the difference between a $30 Hamilton Beach and Vitamix is night and day.
But can it blend??
Get better soon!
Now you have to do an episode on immersion blender soups.
I was watching This while I was eating tomato soup and a grilled cheese thing to myself I wish I could have that

In honor of the Fruits Basket reboot, can you do Leek soup?
I too am sick. I somehow now feel a lot better. Thanks Babi. 🙏🏻
Made the elote soup after seeing your appearance on the ad lib dinner party. A friend of mine kept exclaiming in the middle of dinner something to the effect of, "This soup is amazing!" 10/10 would recommend for your next dinner party or gathering.
Appreciate that you've tried to upload even the simplest of basics recipes whilst on the mend. Even the simplest are sublimely enjoyable on your channel.
I have seen nirvana. It is grilled cheese croutons with soup!!!
Sort of unrelated, but could you do some Fujiwara Fried Tofu from Initial D?
Definitely appreciate the efforts to make stuff dairy/meat free!!! Very cool.
Hope you make a nice recovery Babi! Love all the work you put out!
Why didn’t you do butternut squash soup!!!
Please make the katsudon piroshki from Yuri! On ice!

An upload after a long time. Patiently waiting for your uploads. <3
Finally! Something I can probably make. I hope you feel better Babby
Sick, but that voice, gosh. Makes me melt
Hey yo Babish, if you are into soups I very strongly recommend some Turkish soup recipes. We have many blended/non-blended soups for carnivores/vegetarians/vegens, winter/summer, thick/not-so-thick (i.e. crazy amount of variations). Soups are very important part of our cuisine so I would be very happy if you include at least one of them (e.g. Ezogelin, yum!)  in basics.




Afiyet olsun!
Make Jen Yu’s order from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The whole cod, bite sized meatballs, and shark fin soup.

I like how the video says ep. 36 and the caption says ep. 21
Your voice is how I imagine Archer would've sounded like if he grew up in modern foodie culture instead of drunkard super-spy culture.
Dear Babish,
You should recreat dishes from restaurants such as Big Macs from McDonald’s or chicken fries from Burger King
Uploading even while sick? What a homie!
You should do the chiffon cake Rikido Sato makes from season 3 - episode 13 of My Hero Academia.
I'd love to see you make Yeto's soup from Legend of Zelda

Hi I’ve just started university life so im living by myself for the first time! I’m very excited but as the weeks go by im getting sick bc of my diet with so much instant food which doesn’t feel filling at all. Could you do an episode for college kids or people who’ve just started living alone? I dont even know what to buy for groceries so im spending money on stuff I don’t even use. All the spices i have right now are garlic salt and pepper. 😭😭
You didn't drink honey with garlic! Take some from Brad;)

I should not have watched this at 2 A.M., I don't need to be this hungry this late but damn this looks so good
Another way to make a cream soup, if you are avoiding dairy, is to add a boiled potato cut in bite sizes to the blender. 
Thank you for the video and I hope you feel better soon!
Sometimes I like too steam zucchini or yellow squash and onions and blend them up with olive oil.

Excellent work,  ive enjoyed watching your channel grow as you continue to pump out interesting tv / movie inspired foods and 'basics'.     congrats on the 3.8M subs,    heres to another 3.8M more.
Hey I know you added butter and cream and stuff, but thanks for having a vegan recipe :) As I'm starting to get used to the thought of not eating animal products, it's boggled my mind how dependent everything is on them O.o
I never heard of using Mayo for a grilled cheese. I'm interested

Just made the Elote Soup. And holy god is it fantastic! We served it in small bread bowls and it was super good. Will be making it again!
And here I was just wondering how I could make my own tomato soup instead of using the canned stuff. It's like Babbish is reading my mind.
Imagine getting this kind of food at a hotel.
Feel better man! Love every video you've put out, got me SUPER inspired to start cooking and can now say I feel comfortable in the kitchen, and improvize/ improve some dishes just by my standards (normally "REALLY REALLY spicy"). Love ya!

Man dude you are so dang good at cooking , I can only cook on the grill , wish I could cook like you dude.
Thank you for showing how to make it creamy without dairy <3
Hope you feel better soon! Also, these soups look great :)
I was sick for a while and lost my appetite for anything. Your channel makes me feel better, atleast to the point where I'm willing to eat.
Have you tried Ina Garten's roasted tomato and basil soup? It's delicious, I think you would really enjoy it if you love tomato soup.
I'm surprised you didn't mention that if you want a blender soup REALLY smooth you might want to strain it.
That Tomato soup recipe is bitchin good. Came back to the video after making a bowl just now.
babish are you really using SPICE SUPREME $1 oregano smh

I'd really love to see a vegan or vegetarian video from you!
I heard that rice will have the same or similar effect that the bread will in the tomato soup.
I actually prefer basics over the regular show. Maybe cuz I don’t watch sponge bob or the other cartoons often referenced. 

But why do u use a lighter to light the stove?
Dude, congrats on getting on trending!
I made kronks spinach puffs with my grandmother
For a split second I thought it said Bender’s soup 😭😭 I got so excited only to be disappointed. Please do a Futurama episode 🛸🙏🏻 I beg of you.

Looks good! For a future basics episode, could you show how to properly cook, de-shell, and different ways to serve lobster? I love lobster, but I don't want to pay for it at a restaurant, and it seems pretty intimidating to prepare in the kitchen. Thank you! Your channel is the best.
Get well soon Babish- the world needs your sass and cooking skills!
I so love this video...Thanks so much for the deliciousness. I hope you feel better.🙏👍❤
Tuesday for basics.... 
The cycle is broken...

Gratuitous bacon flipping at the end made me blush.

Perfect timing for this episode, getting my wisdom teeth removed next week

I thought it said benders soup. I assumed it was something from futureama
dude you're a genius no matter the number of ingredients
I think Michael Scott's "One of Everything" cocktail from the episode "Moroccan Christmas" would pair VERY well with one of your meals.
How are we going to ignore the fact I just uploaded a banger vid?
A video over mirin wine? I'd love to know how to use it.
Dude I love your videos they've helped me find something I can do to make people happy
Did you do that food styling thing where you put a ramekin or something in the bowl of soup so the toppings don’t sink?
Hey! Babish! I'm sorry I haven't been here for a while. School's rough... But is that a sigil on your right arm? Okay That's all... Love you. <3
"Grill me a cheese"- Sterling Archer

Do sizzling shrimp from tv show Chuck!

I tried the blend bread into the sauce thing, I didn't like the results it gave a bread after taste for me, but it gave me the idea of making a roux and slowly incorporate the soup. WAY better. :)
I assumed this was a tutorial for Blender 3D
Make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
I'm always down for soup. I like my tomato soup with a lil' crushed red pepper for a touch of heat. Grilled cheese croutons are a revelation.
Aw~ get well soon~ (sorry for sayin it late tho)
I really like the end... you should add a minute of just cooking something in the dish at the end of every video like you did here with the bacon
thanks for the content dad
grilled cheese croutons why didn’t I think of that...
Is Babish immunocompromised? He's sick like every three weeks!
idk if you have the time or anything, but im going to north Carolina to meet my best friend, and i dreamed i brought him a gigantic meatball. im leaving April 13th and have no idea how to make a giant meatball 😂😂
ill probably just figure it out on my own but i think watching you attempt a giant meatball would be super fun
Lobster Thermador from Lego Batman Movie pls
Is it just me, or are Babish’s videos getting shorter and shorter and shorter?

Like there’s not even an intro monologue anymore for basics..

And there were only two soups... I know he’s sick but basics are prerecorded and back in the day there would be like, seven soups in one vid...
Please make aunt petunias pudding from Harry Potter 2

Grilled Cheese but instead of American, Mozzarella
Thought this was benders soup lol
Any plans for a vegan/vegetarian special?
Every second of any of your videos simply brings joy to my heart, and hunger to my stomach
Cashew cream replaces heavy cream. Let's go! (But, um, the grilled cheese can remain in full sandwich form, thank you.)
Nom nom nom nom😍
Hold on Babish. Tuesdays are pop culture recipe days. That's the way we've always done it. I'm highly upset by this change, I can't manage my week properly when you're making changes like this.
Would you ever try to make Phò? It's a vietnamese soup. It would be amazing if you did.
The one thing I would do differently with the corn soup is to use the cobbs to make a creamy stock. Boiling the cobbs will pull out all the "milk" I believe its called. Look up Marjorie Druker of New England Soup Factory's Ultimate Corn Chowder for a great corn stock
for april fools you should make steamed hams and just go to your local mc donalds
You should do the cheese sensation from californication
Taco hat from The Simpsons please
Please make the shrimp parm from the goldbergs
Thoughts and prayers
Hey, Babish! Could you make Marge Simpson’s Never Give Up brisket from The Simpsons?

(I also like meats in my dishes to add a bit of protein, especially for dinner, so it would be fun to make a chicken tomato soup or as I will serve it as, awesome tomato soup with some chicken on the side because I don't know what I am doing)

"Gonna make this one dairy free" he says before drizzling it with dairy and tossing in a sandwich that's literally nothing but cheese. I joke ofc, I hadn't heard of the bread trick before and I'm really happy you mentioned it because I'm lactose intolerant (can still do small amounts of stuff like butter but creamy soups have been out of my reach).
I love the music in this

When I first moved away from home I always made a carrot blender soup, which was basically just a few carrots, an onion, some garlic cloves, vegetable stock, creme fraiche and a dash of sweet chili sauce mixed together. It was great, but I ended up making it so often that I grew tired of it, haha!

You know, I have a pretty messed up mouth, a terrible under bite that ive hated all my life, and i have the choice to get surgery on it to fix it, but it would mean I need to get my mouth wired shut, so seeing this from you kinda reminded me of that and gave me some ideas for foods I could make to...actually eat with my mouth wired shut like that,
So Thanks
Make the ribs from Norbit
Babish could probably keep the kocher salt industry alive by himself.
I'm pretty sure this dude is just always sick...
You should make that one dish from that one thing.
Do you have to torch light your stove everytime?
No clue why but watching this video made me want to make Bagna Cauda... Maybe its all the butter and garlic that you used.
I think if you did another series where you take previous episode uncut, not edited in anyway just you cooking and is watching, no commentary just soothing music to watch a man do something he loves.
Get well soon Andrew!

Awesome video. I can hardly wait to try that corn soup, it looked amazing. I am curious if there is a good replacement for those canned tomatoes. I just can not tolerate the  metallic taste of acidic foods that have been canned. I know I can use fresh in season but there is easily 2 feet of snow outside right now and I would really love to make it. My husband is not feeling well either so the timing is great. I sure hope you are feeling better. Thank you so much for sharing. :)

Ayyy I’m sick too👌
I’m felling quite bad and this is helping it get better
Why does it not become popcorn
Are you using a normal blender or a high powered one? I don’t really know the difference, and if I need one to do these myself.
Hope you have a speedy recovery, buddy.

How does it feel to be more trending than the Jonas brothers
For a less than vegan variety, I like making home made tomato soup with a can of chicken broth, a quart jar of tomato juice (pulverized, unfiltered juice with tomatoes  from the garden last year - once I run out I’ll probably just use tomatoes), about a tablespoon of cream, some basil and a variety of salt, pepper and garlic to taste. I also like a thicker soup, so I usually start it with a butter and flour roux. Absolutely delicious <3
Waw !  his voice is even sexier when he's sick.
Hey Babish! Today you missed Mardi Gras! Fat Tuesday! You need to do food from HBO's Treme. King Cake. Next year!

I hope you feel better soon.

Hey here is a blender soup you didn't get to: Broccoli and Cheese soup.  You take broccoli (I use 2-3 full florets) cut it up into small pieces and boil in salted water until the broccoli is able to be sliced cleanly with little to no resistance with a fork.   Then you take the broccoli, put it into the blender with a good sharp cheddar and fill it with the broccoli water until you are half way up the broccoli.  Blend until smooth, add salt and pepper to taste.
Looks good, but I would implore everyone to use fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned. Same method, just tastes fresher.
HAGGIS!
Do the sushi scene from isle of the dogs!1
Did anyone else think his voice kinda sounded like CGP Grey in this video?
Oy... that is just so much butter in every part of both recipes. This may make people thinking cooking from scratch is healthy, but adding so much butter, plus cream, plus cheese, plus olive oil is just too much saturated fat, and fat in general.
Does he ever say what kind of knife he uses to chop up ingredients? I’m teaching myself to cook and hate using my little paring knife for everything
When I'm sickie poo (hungover) a great chicken fried steak is just the remedy i need. Any chance you could cook up a cfs video?

Seriously, thank you for the tomato soup bread idea! I started dairy-free this year and love making tomato soup but really miss the boost it gets from cream. Gonna try this instead!

I have a challenge for you : bobs burgers recently released a new episode called “Romin bob-iday” where he ends up helping Patricia completely a catering for 77 sandwiches needing to be picked up in 40 minutes! Your challenge is to grab a friend and make all 77 of the sandwiches listed on her board in 40 minutes or less! I paused the show a few times and you can clearly read the sandwich ingredients and a few are sung about in the ending credits

Is there a reason to use kosher salt in a blender?
Babbs, i love you bro but dear god don’t scrape food off the knife with the blade turned up like that. I had a spit take and yelled “DEAR GOD NO!!!” so loud everyone in the house woke up. I had a PTS moment from the few times I’ve ran a finger over the blade and my kitchen became a bloody mess. A realistic pain memory hit me when i saw that. Food looks delicious btw.
Lovely
This does not come from me just like to put that out there, my mother who is old and going to the weird al Yankovich show, wanted to ask if you could make the twinky weiny sandwich from the movie UHF

For a Basics, can we have a episode where you use things like the front and back of bread loaves (white bread and such) and other things people don't always eat?
Can I just get a loop of you flipping 3 pieces of bacon in a sizzling hot pan playing to nice flute music for an hour?
Can you please make B**ch Lasagna in order for PewDiePie to beat T-Series?
If you're not using the back of the blade to scrape the cobs, you're wasting good corn!
Any chance you’d take a shot at making Scooby Snacks? Both Shaggy and Scooby love them, maybe you can come up with a few recipes that are human and dog friendly?

Isn't it dangerous to put hot liquids into a blender?  Y'know, pressure buildup, the whole "exploding blender in my kitchen" deal not sounding like a pleasant way to eat the soup, lol.
it's a good day when babish uploads
Bon Bons from spongebob please.
Good that you're getting your rest; hope you keep comfort food in the freezer for these emergencies. Am recovering from the flu, too, and though plant based, admit that the struggle pushed me over the brink to chicken soup, cause I couldn't get it together to make the vegan hot and sour soup I craved.  Now your tomato soup and grilled cheese croutons dish is taunting me!    Feel better soon!

I love soup recipes cause they are one of the few things which I'll think "Fuck yeah, I can ACTUALLY make this".
Soups are so god damn simple.

As opposed to most other recipes on YouTube, which I watch as food porn.
This reminded me of the Matzo Ball Soup from season 2 ep. 9 of Sleepy Hollow. I have no idea what it is but it looked amazing. Would love to see it on the show.
Shouldnt you allways make a roux for cream soups ?

Great looking soups, get well soon, babs.
i'm actually planning on making grilled cheese and tomato soup tonight, and whenever i buy ingredients i ponder "has babish done anything like this yet?". when i realized no i just bought a can of soup.

Great video and get well soon
I'm disappointed. Mayo on grilled cheese gives a better color, but it doesn't taste nearly as good as butter. I believe all grilled cheese sandwiches deserve the flavor of butter, no matter how ugly they may be.
"Add a solid cup of water."

Babish that's ice.
GRILLED CHEESE CROUTONS??!! You absolute madman I love you

Never had corn soup before! (I'm from Sweden. Guess it's quite an American thing...you guys love corn).
I'll try it.
My go-to blender soups are potato+broccoli,  cauliflower, jerusalem artichoke or green pea. (Never been a fan of tomato soup, unless it's bouillabaisse)
Grilled cheese crouton, so genius, yet so simple

Good soups are good! Get well soon <3
Am I the only one that though the title was Bender soups like from futurerama.

Oh and something to give you a chuckle. I read the thumbnail wrong. I thought it said 'Bender Soups.' It's been a while since I watched Futureama, but I remember Bender trying to be a chief at some point. So I thought you were doing something from that episode. XD
i wanna marry your soups <3
Feel better buddy, rather you happy and healthy than sick and dying :) <3
That tomato soup is a reason for me to suck it up and get a blender! If only I had the money...:(

Babish, just to let you know, save the silk of the corn and you can make a tea that you can drink hot or cold, is pretty good for the stomach and digestion problems, you`re welcome.

This cooking show is way tooooooo fast. His talking is unstopable.

The only that makes it better is pop culture reference. Which Spider Man does it better.

But I guess this is Youtube... You can learn cooking from the somewhere else on the Internet, this is merely for entertainment😕

It’s impressive that you can create fantasy food but holy god that looked like a stomach ache!
So were ignoring the fact he just got on his knees two handed a bottle of mayo and squirted it in his mouth then lip

What about the Krabby Patty Pizza? :(
I thought I'm gonna throw up... that is so disgusting and unhealthy .
So.... You should double batter a hamburger and then very carefully lower it down into the preheated oil, fry it for 4 to 6 minutes until evenly golden-brown and crisp, and use that time to contemplate what life decisions might has brought you to that point. Legendary.
Some one make a meme quik

You don't season your patties with paprika, brown sugar, onion/garlic powder, or anything like that?
Everyone: *makes a meme of that*




Master chief: 
Good. Quality video
You’ve got to do a reboot of the Krabby Patty with the speculated secret ingredient of crab meat as the burger.
I am going to make sexually explicit memes of you guzzling that Mayo.
Finally a damn cool recommendation. In my area it actually is illegal to make a meme since you've clearly stated it. Dang this chef!
3:51 The face of regret
Would Ramsay say it's overcooked?

3:49 I remember when YouTube was a kid friendly place 😂😂
That last frame
Oh man that’s how I wish to look after meeting Babish
That looked amazingly mouth watering delicious
Make the monster patty! The one where spongebob breaks his spatula
I absolutely love how judgmental Babish is towards this deep fried burger while he’s making it, until he gets to the cross section and discovers that it actually looks okay. He keeps his judgy tones when taste testing it only to realize ‘Damn, this actually good...’

Conclusion: Babish is Squidward
I’m actually really disgusted by this
No ones allowed to make a meme with that







Try me
well, squidward was right...it is disgusting
but it looks good on the animation tho

Dude I thought you meant the burger that the fat guy orders to squidward which then he responds “ we serve food here sir”
That is a heart attack waiting to happen.
Do a Monster Krabby Patty...
Lol you became a meme for a week and a half
I think I'm in love.
So sad that Andrew had to resort to prostituting himself because of YouTube demonitization. 3:49 See you on YouPorn
This is before I’ve watched the video and let me say if you don’t drink the mayonnaise I’m gonna personally hunt you down and staple your teeth together




Edit: I am pleased. There will be no stapling of the teeth today.
Plankton likes this.
I though you couldn’t post porn on YouTube
Yeah you take that mayo ;)
Is Mayonnaise an instrument?
That's great except krabby paddies are made with crab meat so uh yeah............
3:49 that is how babies are made
Plankton wants to know your location.
Demn that's heart attack.
BUKKAKE WITH BABISH

That mayo shot in the mouth made me gag.

I got a heart attack just watching this
I'm gonna comment "Courage, the Cowardly Dog" in every video you make until I get a Happy Plums recipe!!! Please?
You should put the salt immediately before cooking. By putting it way before, all the juices in the burger will be "sucked" out. But nice video anyways,
🤣
*goes into cardiac arrest
Didnt the bread absorb the oil when fried??
that last part was more awkward than cotton candy randy
You started everything very usual,estetic,boring and then after some time i started to like you
Ahem ...... Two shots of vodka
That looked painful
The POV shot tho
Johnny sins is a chef now 

He can do any job really
He did the mayo
M a y o n n a i s e

He even went for the money shot. Babish the real MVP
PLEASE MAKE THE NACHO HAT FROM THE SIMPSONS/ DESPICABLE ME

Wait, thats illegal.
That burger made me do what that mayo bottle did at the end
People are happy to be arrested here LOL

Who felt his heart kick his brain 🧠 for doing that
Bukkake with Babish?
At the end this wigga knew exactly what would be cumming (hehehehahahahaha) if he didn’t say its illegal to make it a meme
Gay johnny sins
It's deep fried, everything is great deep-fried
WHY DID YOU USE BOTH HANDS THO?
3:50 the look of regret and embarrassment is the best

Nice watch
I never have food to eat... Why do I torture myself watching your channel?!

Have you thought about doing Robbie Rotten's blue cake?
Everyone in the comments: It’S iLEgaL
Me: CHRIS IS THAT A WEED... IM CALLING THE POLICE
Microwave oven: beep beepbeep
Does it fry?, Aye!
What I love but so hate about this channel is that the food looks so good but it is so far out of reach and no normal person can remake food like this
*gets up, looks in fridge for deep fried burger, curses God
i love it when seagull cooks its so cool
Which part of eating a magically-sentient food tastes best: its thoughts, feelings, hopes, fears, or ability to love?
This isn't the only Babish episode with a Steve1989MREInfo reference and I'm okay with it.
"Let's get this onto a trey...nice."


Nice. Very, very nice.
@5:30 paused, scrolled down...hey im not the only one!!!
That steve1989MREinfo reference was quite....



Nice!
PLEASE make the elven bread/ the king regent’s meal from Lord of The Rings.
(any kind of LOTR food would be amazing to see) :D
Steve1989MREinfo @ 5:30

Nice.
5:35 steve1985 reference lol I didn‘t know babish watches his videos too!
4:04 you have fermented red bean paste on hand, but ginger is too much to ask 🤣
Yoooo bao won an Oscar😉😉
is it just me or does 'lightly' and 'heavily' flowered work surface mean the same to him
For true Asian way, use no measurements.
No oiling parchment paper.. makes them too greasy, if you use the cabbage leaves as the bed instead, I feel like that works best.
5:31 caught me off gaurd and boy was it amazing
Can you do the gooby berry sundae for my pal spongebob?
No One :
Gordon Ramsay : NEVER PUT COOKED FOOD WITH RAW FOOD!!
tip for making char siew bao: try using Hong Kong flour instead of all purpose to get that super white and fluffy bun :^)
This is now my Favourite Babish video. The Steve1989MRE reference, the stuffups, and my favourite Chinese Yumcha at the end. Nice!
ANY NOTICE THE STEVIE1989Info reference!? SHOCKED ME SHOCKED!
6:09 I would definitely be that selfish weirdo, because that bowl would be empty. Sorry, no Bao today...not sorry. Lol 😩😅
The Steve impression was... 




"Nice, M kay
THAT MRE REFERENCE <3 (mm nice hiss!) XD
I caught that Steve1989MREinfo reference;)
let's get this out on to a tray






Me: surprised Pikachu
Woah a Steve1989MREInfo reference.




Nice!
Dear Babish, would the second bbq pork mix work well in a baked pork bun? Also do you have a good recipe for it? If so could you please send it to me or make a video?
The B in Bao is pronounced more similarly to P than B.
Do I hear Steve1989?
Babish:And I happily raise Either of them as my own child....

Me:Me to Me to
My MRE people will be scrolling through these comments.
I love how he used the “ lets get this onto a tray , nice “ thing from the MRE reviews💀
Steve1989MREinfo reference is the thing that made my day, thank You
‘Bao’ won the Oscar!
Steave 1989 off mre info refrece 
NICE
5:30 Someone has been watching some MRE reviews
As a Chinese,I have to say:
They look so delicious,and your so creative
My local "Chinese" buffet (americanized Asian stuff) uses cabbage leaves as their parchment paper in their steamers. The natural oils help with sticking and give it a nice tangy smell.
Hey babish!!
Just made this tonight and was super awesome to share the process with my mom. 

Question though: whats the deal with the windmill technique? My mother was a baker for years and has no clue what this does. Couldn't you just divide into smaller, more rollable sections?
I don't Trust a Man who openly admits to eating his own children.  :(
gotta love the steve reference there...
Tyr something called "loh mai kai" Asian food for steamed rice with meat and other stuff it's dark brown sweet kinda and savoury
LOL the MRE reference was so good.
So glad you made a SteveMRE reference. That guy is awesome!!
"Let's get that pork out on a tray. Nice." caught me by surprise. Nice.
I got real confused when I suddenly heard Steve1989MREInfo putting pork on a tray. 

Nice.
I love the steve1989 reference. Was just watching one of his videos.
The mre Steve reference caught me off guard. Kudos
I...I can't believe Babish just did a Steve1989MREInfo impression...I love that so much.  I kind of didn't know that anyone else knew who he was.  I love his videos and I'm so surprised to see him impersonated by a much bigger channel.
5:30 DAMN YOU REALLY NAILED THE STEVE IMPRESSION
Still waiting on my krusty crab pizza and diet dr.kelp
That Mre steve reference made my week. thank you babish. You should try to recreate some Mre meals with Steve.
That Steve1989 reference is ABSOLUTELY DECADENT
Steve1989mreinfo 
I knew it as soon as I heard your voice impression nice
Minseok is that you??? YO I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN THE ARMY
I demand a crossover. Steve1989MREinfo and Binging With Babish. Make it happen or we riot
That MRE Steve reference got me
Yo, Bao legit made my mom outright sob in the theatre
5:31 MRE guy reference aka steve
Do one on the Mississippi Quinn from regular show
LETS GET THIS OUT ON TO A TRAY, NICE!
Let’s put this comment on a post.. Nice!!!
Love that reference to Steve1989mre!!
You should do pizza gyoza form the 2012 ninja turtles cartoon!

I imagine that's something you could make 4 variants of with little effort.
I see what you did there! You have been watching Steve MRE 1989, so I got your reference!

Let's put that meat on the tray.

Nice!
Babish, you should try making jelly donuts that look like Japanese rice balls, in honor of the infamous localization in the 4Kids dub of "Pokemon."
The whole time I thought the filling was Pico de Gallo 😱

This is even better!
Was that an "MRE Guy" reference? 😃
"Chop up a small head"
-Babish
(Let's make this confusing for other people)
I DEMAND A REFUND WHERE IS MY NEW BAO SON
“Now let’s get this pork out onto a tray. Nice” HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE ANCIENT MRE REVIEWING WORDS
That Steve reference. Nice!
Just won the Oscar for best short film. Yay!
Neat trick: Instead of using parchment or wax paper, use cabbage to line your bamboo steamer. Preferably a napa cabbage. Clean, tastes good, and no having to throw anything away after.
Honestly, you should make the Strawberry shortcake from my favorite childhood game- Kirby : Squeak Squad!
You can oil parchment paper or use a leaf of cabbage,  or a leaf of lettuce instead so it won't stick
Please do a PO ( the dad) from Kung Fu panda's soup / just any food from his restraunt recipie pls
This is too much work, I'mma just go to my grandma's
2:11 The main problem is that you're trying to measure it at all

For a truly authentic taste and perfect proportions, eyeball everything
Cha siu bow is basically a pork bun. You can find it all over Hong Kong and other places
This is the second time he’s done this with the Steve1989mreinfo
was that a Steve1989MREInfo reference????????
I love the Steve 1989 reference, my brain suddenly went "wait, what?" And those buns look insanely good! Definitely going to try them out.
you pronounced it wrong but I'm not here to judge
Hey could you do a regular show special like grilled cheese deluxe,sandwich of death,double death sandwich,benson chicken wing chili,sandwich of life,super sub sandwich,and rigjuice
5:31 THAT’S THE MRE GUY! I LOVE THAT GUY!
Binging with Bao-bish? (Seriously though, these look so good, thank you so much for showing us so many awesome recipes!)
You should make rig-juice from season 2, episode 24 of regular show. I wanna know if it really does make your face feel like magic.
5:30 ...ahahahaha..well played
Although not a professional, having made dozens of baozi's with family I do wish I can teach and give you some extra tips when rolling out the dough and folding the buns. 🤣🤣 Good attempt though!
Nice Steve1989 reference there, you should remake MREs, a gourmet MRE
Love the MRE steve1989 reference "Let's get this on the tray, Ok"
It's not char sui bou 😡
Hey Babish why not Kel’s sauce from “Good Burger” or Butter Toast and Gravy From “ED, EDD, EDDY”
You earned a subscriber. This was a very relaxing yet hilarious content you put out. I love this so much 😊
When he made that Steve1989MREInfo reference i spat out my food. Best youtuber mentions the god of all MREs. Nice.
What???? We actually don't put honey
😂😂Just sugar
He should make "Maika’s Sadistic Parfait" from episode 2 of Blend-S 
(If you don't know blend s it's The S stands for meme.)
Showbiz deli from love hurts and so does art king of the hill
andrew i love you but you need to be more sustainable my guy
1:08 "After it's 2-hour rest, the dough should've 'a-bao-t' doubled in size..."


babish


pls
That steve1989 reference made my day.
You should make foods from the Loud House, like MAC & Cheese or Casa Loud Casserole.
Firstly, I love all your videos. Secondly, you should make the burnt pie from Ralph Breaks the Internet 😂
Stop referencing all my favorite YouTubers!!!!

Steve1989MREinfo has entered the chat
I was so confused to see a whole short film in the cinema tbh 
It was so weird to me 

PS: didn't actually cook a man, 7/10
Steve MRE AND Charlie Day?!? 🥰🥰🥰
How bout we get this pork out onto a tray. Nice! Loved that steve1989 reference. You should do a fancy version on the MRE foods.
Coming from a Chinese person it looks like you did pretty good! Also it’s pronounced “cha sue”
Did this man really just pay homage to Steve
Love your show. Will you being giving out a list of the recipes/ingredients/materials you will be using before the live show? I would love to participate as I watch.
OH MY GOD you should make the noodles Po’s dad makes from Kung Fu Panda I think one bowel had a ninja star in it but I’d love to see you make that (your awesome man)
I love your channel...and love your passion,  but I beg of you to include a screenshot pause recipe And method retaining around 5 seconds...just a suggestion?
5:29 JerryRigEverything Impersonation? :D
WAS THAT A Steve1989MREReveiw REFERENCE?!
More like Binging with Baobish. 

I’ll be here all week.
Hey babish/Andrew make the turducken from regular show
Thank you for this! I've been meaning to recreate these baozi at home, but I've been nervous about certain steps and kept postponing
Yes the Steven1989MREinfo reference, I love it
Are steve1989 references the new jojo references?
You should try and cook for MRESteve, I'm worried he hasn't had fresh food in years and doesn't know what he's missing.
Tiny whisk always comes through in the clutch
Hearing you do Steve's "lets get this on a tray, nice, okay." Just made my day. Love both you guys videos.
This guy is a really good chef
He should have a youtube channel
some people use lettuce instead of greased paper inside the bamboo steamer. It doesnt stick!
Could you collaborate with Maangchi or Jun’s Kitchen some time?
I'm impressed but I'm obsessed with soup dumpling
AHHH THE STEVE1989 REFERENCES!! please do some kind of crossover with him, i'd love to see that.
Whenever my great grandmother brings bao it doesn’t look like that, they don’t looked steamed. They look baked or something like that.
WOAH WOAH WOAH was not prepared for a SteveMRE shoutout
Try to make Mississippi Queen from the Regular Show
OMG that Steve impersonation from Steve1989MREInfo was perfection
"Because it's headed into our bao you selfish weirdo."


I died.


Edit: Woah, Woah, Whoa, when did this comment blow up?
Standard Lee Kum Kee soy sauce tastes better than its "premium" counterpart
Can you please make the Super Yellow Okumura Rin special from Blue Exorcist?!!!
Four times. You did this recipe 4 times D: It was amazing though
Loved the vid but Please just use the metric system. 
=D
So when is that Bao going to grow limbs and find a girlfriend?
And thus we also have Nikuman, which is basically a Japanese variant of baozi, and prevalent in many an anime series.
That SteveMRE1989 voice you did almost made me pee my pants
I had to replay twice to make sure that you were referencing stevemre lol 
Nice one I loved it lol
That mre dude reference/impression was badass
An alternative to oiling the parchment paper is replacing the paper with cabbage leaf.
I'd love to meet you Babish!! 
Don't have the best kitchen but i could find one we can use lol.
I legit did a spit take at that SteveMRE quote! Babish always catches me with that "out of left field" humor!
How about we get this charshu prok out onto a tray
nice

Think I didn't see what you did there?
I know you already did an Always Sunny special, but you should really make a “Grilled Frank.” 
It sounds so disgusting and I would love to see your improved version of it 😂😂
OMG!!! BwB is a MRE FAN!!!!! Love me some Steve1989, but gotta send some love to the OG gschultz9 too!
I really appreciate you showing the mistake you made. Learning to cook new recipes is learning from mistakes. Great vid as always
Char Sui bun is my favourite, my step mum makes it all the time 🤤🤤

Babish: Lightly floured surface

DUMPS HALF THE BAG OF FLOUR
Hi, can you please make a pork cutlet bowl pirozhki from yuri on ice? I really like that show and it would be great to have a real recipe to recreate the food. Pr just a normal pork cutlet bowl or pirozhki.
if you use napa cabbage instead of parchment paper, your bao won't stick :)
Bao Bao Bao, Rubber Biscuit. Binging With Crosbish
A good idea would be to place them on a salad or cabbage leaf instead of oiled surface. Beautiful video as usual
The pronounciation of Char Siu makes miso sad.
Thank you for using a reusable plastic wrap alternative  <3
YES REFERENCES TO MY BOY Steve1989MREInfo! You're the best Babish!
Lmao the reference really made me love this recipe even more!

The MRE guys tray line was an amazing touch
where TF IS MY KUNG FU PANDA NOODLES
Wishing I had time to learn about and buy Chinese condiments/flavourings.
Hearing him say baozi like bow-zee was really funny. It's pronounced more like bao-zuh.
5:29 loved the steve1989 reference! lol that was awesome!
Should get Steve1989mreinfo in a video and make some of the mre foods with him that would be “nice”

He Protecc

Was it just me or did the way they cut this episode make it feel like they were chopping it a second too short each frame? Either way, the buns look delicious!
I can't believe that Steve1989MREInfo reference omg
I got confused when he said, that he couldn't taste the filling, then I remembered that I'm from Germany
Should've used nappa cabbage instead of parchment paper. Do soup dumplings in another episode
Title reminded me of baozi Xiumin 😭😩💕
I love your honesty towards making mistakes; cooking is no walk in the park lol
I've been craving those baozi i ate when i was in Beijing last spring! I hope this recipe will be just as good! Can't wait to try it! thank you!
Make Allison’s sandwich from The Breakfast Club!
The Steve1989MREInfo nod @5:30 haha nice one
U should do bar essentials/cocktails pt.2 with the Vesper martini (from James Bond movie Casino Royale) included !!
You should try making Nick Miller's "the sauce" from new girl
I loved that Steve reference @bingingwithbabish
You should make Lars’ ube roll from Steven Universe. I’ve always wanted to try ube, and I love seeing you work with more interesting ingredients
Please make the "Meviled Eggs" from “Chowder” or something else from the show.

Could you maybe make one of the donuts Agnes serves from The Umbrella Academy?
I didn't even know I've been waiting for this, but I've been waiting for this.
Thank you for covering this recipe!
I don't always eat Baos, but when I do.. its in 360p
Steve reference!!!!!
Bud, I will literally pay for your KitchenAid reusable lid so you don't need to keep using disposable plastic wrap for your proofing.
i love the reference, it was spot on and perfect! haha
I feel weirdly citicised when you said " try not eating the bowl like a bowl of cereal you selfish weirdo"
 o.o
Steve1989MREInfo reference in Babish video? ...Well...Babi, you gotta make collab now, this is only logical progression.
Hears “nice, mkay”
Cries deeply
he predicted bao winning an oscar!!!!
Make a Zebra leg like the one from Lion king
Well now you have to do dumplings from kung foo panda dumplings 🥟
If you really wanna nail the recipe, don’t use measurements





Trust me
Meemaws Brisket from Young Sheldon
SteveMRE! Nice!
Babish, you know what you have to do. Remake some of Steve's MREs. I don't know how, but ya gotta do it.
5:29 
I wonder how many people are gonna get why he changed into that voice
lembas bread or samwise's rabbit stew from lord of the rings
5:30 
Is that a Steve mre reference by any chance?
Love the show, could you do heat measurements in celsius as well for your fans outside the US? :)
Aye!! Nice shoutout to Steve! 🐐
My mom's face lit up when she saw your video. Each Chinese family usually have their own way of wrapping, and she's got her own recipe of making baos, with different fillings, from Pork to Char Siew to Prawn and Salted Egg Custard. Btw, she LOLed hard when you didn't oil your parchment paper. Thanks Andrew!
Steaming dumplings is a crime. Fry those bad boys.
I saw that Sou Vide Everything did a McRib, but I’d rather see you make one!
Noice Steve1989MREInfo reference! 🤣
i just started watching Steve1989MREInfo and the little bit you did was such a great reference!!!
WAS THAT A STEVE1989MREINFO REFERENCE!?
I loved the MREInfo reference babish.
Transcript stops at 1:10.

Also, nice.
I just stumbled across some dude that eats MREs for fun (and profit) and everyone I watch is referencing him...
Eyyy and it won an Oscar!
AHG STEVE1998 MRE REFERENCES! Shit man my two favorite channels and apparently they know each other
M A K E  P O U T I N E 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Holy crap Steve reference take all of my likes
Make hazelnut soup from tangled
as a chinese person, i am entertained by his pronunciation of 'bao'
THAT SHOUT OUT TO STEVE MRE
Brunch from the Portlandia brunch episode next!!!
I'd like to see recipes from the super babes restaurant in Batman and Harley Quinn. Power girl jumbo combo, black canary leg and thigh with coleslaw and finally, Hawk girl spicy wings.
The reference to Steve. God bless
"Let's put this out on a tray, NICE".  MRE INFO STEVE1989.
He should do a randy from South Park episode there’s so many recipes
You are supposed to have a bunch of broth, garlic-Chili sauce and some msg stuff in order to make it the true Asian way.
Alright, let’s get this out onto a tray... Nice!
Please recreate the Lightning-y mushroom from Pixar’s Ratatouille. Love your videos. Subscribed!
5:30 didn't know you watched Steve1989MREinfo lol
Watching you tear the Bao from the paper hurt me. That's probably the worst feeling of "Oh god I should have oiled this nooOO" - especially with the added second attempt like "Maybe it was just that one... no ok it's all of them great"
this is your best episode, by far
5:28 this literally sounds just like my commanding officer
I love that he does the recipe from the source first then does his own take. It’s like he wants to respect the movie or show but try something new, add ideas, and tweak the recipe


Amazing
Take a bao, Andrew. Magnifico!
A Steve1989 reference?


Nice.
Also, u can put some black vinegar on the bao. Tastes good. Trust me, I'm Chinese.
Banish sounds like the culinary equivalent of Zefrank sometimes
Steve1989MREinfo?  5:30 ? Let's get this out onto a tray, ok nice
I must say, that Steve1989MREInfo reference caught me off guard and absolutely made my day. Well done, sir. I'll keep an ear out for a subtle spoon jingle.
Amazing channel and video, would you try to replicate the marble tofu from cook up a storm?
The Steve reference made me love you even more
Make food from the anime Food Wars. You have so many amazing options.
More like Binging with Bao-bish, am I right guys?
Can we get food from Steven universe (bagel pizza, ketchup inside the frys, the spicy sushi short etc)
Babish, you should make a coffee video
Show us all the variants of coffee, promote some machines or something, attempt at getting sponsored. Fun for everyone!
That Steve reference was amazing
The Steve reference was perfect!
Looking pretty good! If you're dealing with raw filling, the way to check for seasoning is to just take a spoonful and fry it up real quick on the stove. Eat that, add salt as necessary, then repeat until you have filling you're satisfied with! I'd advise making it just a tad saltier than you think it should be, since the bread is going to absorb some of that flavor as well. Another tip my mom taught me: toss your cabbage with a bit of salt a little bit before making the filling, then squeezing all the water out. This will not only add seasoning, but it will keep the filling from turning too watery when it cooks.
This will more then likely be my first recipe I try from your show
It should be pronounced “bao tsi
how does he stand so still in the intro it amazes me every time
was it just me or did andrew’s voice sound deeper than usual in the beginning?
it's kinda wild that he references steve, but I'm not mad at all about it
Babish watches SteveMRE. My life is over.
You should make big smokes order from gta San Andreas
Holy shit that Steve reference caught me way off guard
Isle of the dogs sushi scene!

Char siu literally means roasted on a fork, so yeah, char siu sauce is literally Chinese barbecue sauce
Im not complaining, but I had honestly forgotten that youre known for making food from TV and movies lmao
Shrimp Parm from the Goldbergs!
Hey Babish!! I've been a big fan of your videos for a little while now and any time you come out with a new video my boyfriend and I watch it together as soon as we're able c: You have such a wide variety of content you pull your recipes and ideas from and we both love it!! I'm sure you get tons of requests every day, but I can't help but add my own lol
I think it would be super cool if you did something World of Warcraft inspired! There is an official cookbook somewhere out there, but I think it would be cool to see your take on something like Mana Strudel or Cookie's Jumbo Gumbo :D
Regardless of whether or not you do consider this, thank you for all you do and keep up the amazing work!
5:30 great stevemreinfo cameo 😂😂
I'd probably be the weirdo that eats it like a bowl of cereal 😅
Ever been to Joe's Shanghai in Manhattan? Their soup dumplings are to die for.
“bao buns” you can just say bao the bun is redundant 😂
I love it!
Steve1989 and babish collab?? plsss
If you want a juicier, silkier texture, it’s better to hand chop your meat instead of buying ground pork. If you don’t have time for that, at least use a food processor to make your own. Bao requires ground pork with higher fat content than the typical Western ground pork has.
you should make marmalade sandwiches from Paddington!
Please make Chidi's peep chilli from The Good Place!!
only intellectuals watch steve mre 😌
THE TRAY REFERENCE IT MADE MY DAY
Make le poisson from The Little Mermaid!

Did I hear a steve MRE reference in this video lmao.
THAT MRE GUY REFERENCE !!!!!!!!!!!!!! AUTOSUBBED!!!!!
This is the second time he's done this with the Steve1989mreinfo
You have been watching those MRE videos I caught that reference in another video. Awesome.
I eat chicharron every day.
I’m impressed, and I love how your video shows the mistakes you’ve made such as not putting oil on the parchment paper. And I love your dry sense of humor. Keep posting!
Wow, that charsiu looks really good.
5:29 I see Babish has been taking inspiration from our MRE Master Steve1989MREInfo (also known as soft-spoken Steve). I would like to see Babish trying to make something from/for a MRE. See if there's anything he could figure out to make a balanced and tasty meal for on the go kinda people.
I got so excited at the Steve reference 😂 Nice!
Yesssssssssss, Steve ❤️
He did the Steve mre " let's get this on to a tray. Nice mkay" lmao
recipe hack: you can test how the filling tastes by microwaving a small piece of filling and tasting
Tbh I'd eat that with a spoon like its a bowl of cereal.
something about watching you cook is so calming 😩😩
This man throwing shade on MRE boi
but you forget the best one "xiaolongbao" , but its quite hard to do it :D
Baozi is actually pronounced more like "baotza", not "baozee"
When you think you are the only one who watches the MRE channel 🙄😂
Nice watch! What brand / model is that?:)
Can you please do Kingdom Hearts sea salt ice cream
He should do a avatar the last air bender episode
Everybody who watched incredibles 2 watched the bao clip I guarantee at first we’re going wtf
Where can we buy a BWB Branded Tiny-Whisk?
Ahhh a Steve1989MREInfo reference!
Feeling the urgent need of eating 17 baos.

Love that subtle reference. Figure out how to get this shelf stable in an MRE.
Let's get this pork onto a tray, Nice m'kay !
Bro Tiny Whisk is my fave character
Could you make the big bang burger challenge from Persona 5?
You definitely should make Bon Bons from spongebob.
Tip for the dumplings: roll or flatten them to a little over half the desired size, then roll just the edges as you rotate each circle. This gives you a thicker bottom, and thinner edges where you fold it. 
(I'm sure you can find a video with this technique)
That sreve reference 








10/10
I tried some of Poe’s baos at universal studios, it was Good!
please make dumplings from Kung Fu Panda
Make Quesadilla a la Kevin from The Office
Please make sandy (the manny) from f.r.i.e.n.d.s cookies!!
Okay time to check the kitchen.



Huh. Flour.
Doing the char siu. I love you
Bao Zi is actually pronounced with a softer B sound + “Tzeu” instead of “Zee”. Google translate will be most helpful in getting the right sound! -> 包子. Dimsum and charsiew are almost spot on tho!
“But I’d happily raise both of them as my own child” that got me dead🤣💀
True men only use “some” or “a lot” of ingredients.
Make the noodles from Kung Fu panda omg
Id love to see your take on Xiao Long Bao.
Even though you messed up, you could've put it in the right order with the magic of editing.
I'd already seen Emmy eats Japan make this recipe but I was curious to see what you would do with it. She is also a fan of Steve the guy who reviews MREs and you made me giggle and squeal so hard when you did the whole tray and nice bit. Good episode!
Do griddy’s donuts from the umbrella academy
5:59 that caramelization is insane and I now really want Asian food
We demand a SteveMRE crossover video!
Can you make the chocolate whopper from the Burger King April fools video
The way he pronounces 包子 😂
Thank you thank you for showing your mistakes!! It makes it feel a lot easier to tackle and gives good tips.
I have a suggestion why don't you try the Sandvich from TF2
There’s actually a recipes where you can use chocolate as fillings. It’s so good as desert
MAKE THE SUNDAE FROM THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE
man, ion know. I feel like you've seen all my comments WHAT WATCH IS THAT
Please make The Stinky Sandwich from Home Improvement!
Stress eating gone wrong
This is amazing
Great to see a live recipe!  In animation world, to make the dough realistic is just as complex as animating the hands; to make the texture less or more sticky is not just adding more flour.  🥟🥟🥟🥟🥟
Since these freeze so well, should the cook time be adjusted when steaming from frozen?
My dad is great at making ☘🍀 soda 🍞 🇮🇪. Could you make that for St. Patrick day?
Hey Babish, just to clarify, the BBQ pork bun is pronounced cha like Mat-cha, not char. Aside from that looks like something straight out of a traditional Dim sum restaurant.
Moses' Passover dinner from "The Ten Commandments."
Did Babish just make a Steve1989 reference? BABISH JUST MADE A STEVE1989 REFERENCE.
These are bomb when you fill them with pizza stuff ✌
So you're steaming pork, I guess you could say that you are making STEAMED HAMS
stebie1989. nice.
"Little tiny pieces." Please tell me that's a Charlie reference from 'Always Sunny.
It’s aliveee!!!!!
CHAR SIEW BAO!!! 😍😍😍 One of my all-time favourites 😀

Great job! Bao can be hard to make sometimes but it looks like you got it down!
5:30
Make the 4 cheese whopper and big orange bellywash from angry grandpa
Hi!  Ever consider doing one Of the soups from ' The Tale Of  Despereaux'?
bro is that a Steve1989 reference
Binging with Baobish
I cakled loudly enough at the Steve 1989 reference to scare my dogs
I could probably eat like 50 of the second style of bao
If you have made the dough correctly, you should not need to oil the parchment paper. I've made baozi lots of times and I have never had to oil the paper. I have also never seen anyone oil the paper.
5:30 more Steve!!!!!
I know you have already made pie on the show, but could you make the pies from "Pushing Daisies"? Particularly the apple pie with cheese baked into the crust!
Can you make the pseudo pork roll from the anime food wars
You should collab with matt stonie where you make a massive challenge meal and he eats it
Thanks for showing us your mistakes! For me, I sometimes don't take certain cooking steps too seriously until I make a mistake. Really helps illustrate why those steps are so important.
I SCREAMED AT THE MRE REFERENCE WOW
You probably shouldn't call them "Bao buns". Bao in mandarin means bag or bun. "Bun bun". Bao Zi makes a little more sense. Heck, I'll accept "meat bags" more then Bao buns.
You should do the wasabi chicken wings from season 16 episode 2 of The Simpsons.
Nice steve reference! my heart is so happy!

5:29 was that a Steve MRE reference right there babish?
Love the Steve1989 reference and I’m love that you probably watch him as well
Bao makes me so happy. Both the short and the food. Pride 🇭🇰🇨🇳🇭🇰

@steve1989MREinfo
i see you are a man of culter babish 
hint hint MREs
Make Dusty’s fried chicken from Paradise PD! Lol
Did u use coffee instant type 2 in this recipe?
Another way to prevent the bao from sticking to the bamboo steamer is you add cabbage to the bottom instead of oiling the paper. My dad uses this technique all the time and you can use the cabbage for other recipes
That mre reference totally caught me off guard lol
I really like the bao short video before I had to pay $3 just to watch something that was free.
5:30 wow that was amazing
Please do an episode with Sam the Cooking Guy
Stevemre as a guest chef por favor
I was gonna make a steve MRE reference comments but there are already so many of them so nevermind 😅
He seems to make a lot of Steve1989MREinfo references
Was that a Steve MRE reference?
Pronunciation aside, really glad you made this video. Always wondered how my family does this.
You should do Uncle Buck’s Birthday breakfast for Mile’s
Can we use chiccken
Donuts from Umbrella Academy
Love the steve1989 reference
always love the Steve1989 references
For those that want to make the soup version of the dumplings. Make a broth with the pan you cooked the pork in. Get that caramelization mixed with the broth, and remove and add to the mix along with gelatin. Let it cool, and now the mixture is a gelatinous solid! Now you can make the dumplings like he did and when it’s all properly steamed you have a soup base in each dumpling that’s full of flavor.
Was that a Steve1989MREinfo reference?
Nice mmk😂😂😂
BABISH, PLEASE MAKE THE NACHO HAT FROM THE SIMPSONS/DESPICABLE ME!!!
Yay! The red colour in char siu that was missing here is from beet powder :)
Every time you give steve1989 tray line a go I fanboy out.

You should do a thing called gaming with babish where you make meals from games that would be cool
LETS GET THAT OUT ON TO A TRAY
I can't describe that feeling of ecstasy when you put a char siew pao in your mouth
I prefer the Cantonese-style baked kind of cha siu bao
Bao was better than all of the Incredibles 2.
DID YOU JUST MAKE A STEVEMRE REFERENCE LOL 
How far is that mans line gonna travel 
I am so happy you did that
You should do the spicy habanero mango infused queso, the first element of God’s creation, from American dad
O BOI!
the charsiu pork ban are like Hawaiian Manapua
The MRE Reference was gold lol
If anyone was wondering "baozi" (or “包子”) is simply the Chinese word for "bun". nothing too complex. 



Except for the part where “包" means "wrap" and "子" means "child". 

Edit: Yes, I know it means buns. I'm talking about the literal meaning of individual characters and not the word as a whole. And I got a bit of information wrong, sorry about that, should be fixed.
Instead of using paper, you can alternatively use cabbage. It won't stick, and now you have steamed cabbage to snack on while you eat your dumplings.
at 5:25 when he was putting it out on a tray it sounded like steve 1989
Waiting for our dough to rise right now. Have to go get ginger and paper :( this is a pain lol. They better be good!
Steve mre info rocks.
Make any food that appeared in Scooby-Doo and the Gourmet Ghost movie:

Elderberry pie, Lobster(with lemon basil butter & garlic chives), Nacho's Sandwich, or Pasta Salad
Btw it spells as Baozi but actually pronounces as Baoz.

Steve1989 reference?
Pro tip: If you want the proper white fluffy bao try to find some bao flour. It can be hard to get a hold of but it's certainly worth it!
Dude. Let's get this out onto a tray... Nice
I've left this comment before, last week, but I want you to see it so here we go... I don't know if you've ever seen the Disney Channel Original Movie classic that is "Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off", but I have, more than I'd like to admit. I would absolutely LOVE to see your interpretation of the iconic "sauce".  In the movie it's described thus: "like barbecue sauce, but better!") ... so it could be a cool way to talk about barbecue sauce styles (white, vinegar-based, etc.). I just can't imagine how you'd make it purple! Ube barbecue sauce maybe? I'll leave it to you.
THERE YT!!! I watched it
Gotta use a cabbage leaf instead of parchment paper
How about the pizza gyoza from TMNT?
I lost it when he pulled the pork out of the oven. I couldn't cook this, because I'd have just eaten it right then and there.
Use a piece a cabbage as the oiled paper in steam basket.
Rather than lining the steamer with parchment paper, you can line it with pieces of cabbage! Some dimsum places do this, and we also do it at home. You wouldn't have to put any oil down to make the bao not stick, as they should pull fairly easily from the cabbage.
MAKE D12 SALSA
How about doing an episode with stevemre?  Nice hmmkay
Make spongebobs bad breath sundae

Don't normally you roll the dough around the edges so it has a raised bit in the middle to absorb the juices? that's what strictlydumpling taught, anyway
I loved that lil clip before the movie 😭

Great video as always.
Nice...mmmkay. Haha I love the mre reference
plz create a patreon
You gotta appreciate this guy’s dedication to putting a seamless and perfect presentation on the table for all his viewers. Nothing but the best for his subscribers, what a guy.
BTW it is 包子 in chinese and the pronunciation is "Bao-Zuh" not "Bao-Zee"
The trick with fillings that have raw ingredients is you take a glob and put it in a pan with oil to heat up and cook. if it tastes too bland, adjust.
Hi Thank you for your contributions into the culinary world. I am happy to follow you.
A tip. instead of adding Bao to butter paper. use a salad leaf, perfect, it is just to eat the salad leaf too! the same if you steam fish or other dish in your bamboo cooker.
5:30 😂😂😂
omg the tray part has me in tears, Nice.
Steve MRE!
Make food from Studio Ghibli films!
Can you make pad Thai as this is my favourite meal

Bao buns, thats like saying ATM machine, PIN number...😅
Are they more delicious? absolutely! Nothing beats Pork Buns
Cook a little bit of the filling in a pan before stuffing to make sure you've seasoned it correctly 👌
Who else thought they went into the wrong theatre during incredibles2
Can you please make the Apple Turnover from Once Upon a Time???
some chashu baos are placed on a sheet of paper when steaming. like you see that more often in restaurants cause oiling every sheet cost more. they typically come with the bao when you sell em too and you have to peel em off yourself when you eat em. and trust me I have forgotten about that a few times and ate steaming paper.
If you freeze the extra bao, do you let thaw before cooking or cook from frozen? If my bao get semi transparent is it overcooked?
Where can I find a reusable cling wrap like yours?
5:31 reference to mresteve1989
5:30 ONLY REAL 🐐’S UNDERSTAND THAT IMPRESSION
You are so fucking adorable! I love your videos!!
In Bao she steamed the buns on lettuce or something

STEEEEEVEEEEEEE
Think you could do a Basics with Babish episode on Meal Prep?
You should make Muriel’s happy plums from courage the cowardly dog :)
I love the fact that you show us your mistakes - as this is obviously part of the process that allows you to learn and improve. And your humour is first rate.
I have a question! Could I substitute pork for ground chicken, or ground beef? How would that effect the cooking time?
Okay, so I checked and I was totally wrong about bœuf bourguignon and the carrots.
THAT STEVEMRE REFERENCE DOE
THE REFERENCE AT 5:30 GIVES ME LIFE

That Steve1989MREInfo reference was delivered right on a tray, "nice".
Is there a substitute for the ouster sauce? I'm allergic
Chicken Paolo from Suit life
That fuckimg reference caught me off guard lmao
Why did you not use the salad leaves on the bottom of the steaming basket?
Those look really good, but I feel like you still have to stick some veggies in Char Siu Bao like Green Onions or Ginger slivers.
Watching while hungry is not a good idea
I can't believe nobody's said it but come on, BINGING WITH BAOBISH?!
Where do you get your watches?? You gotta put it in the description cuz it’s beautiful!!

MrE review guy. Nice
Do the noodles from Kung fu panda
I am chinese.... so just tellin you ; )
The caption author isn't doing their job very effectively. Other than that this is again a very good video. As I Chinese myself had to say that your cooking skill is really good to make Bao because the hell I know how hard it can be to get the dough around the filling without accidentally poke a hole in it. Good job:)
So Babish when are you and Steve going to do a colab in which you recreate some of his Favorite MREs?
5:29 Steve... Is that you? 😂

It would be awesome if you could make all of that food from Spirited Away that Chihiro's parents "pig out" on! It looks sooooo good!

On the episode of The Office where people bring in canned food, and then are forced to eat what they brought, Kevin mentions eating "brown" every week. I'd love to see how that is made.

Captions died about a third to halfway through the video.
Roll the edges of the dough thinner than the center.  That way, the area where you pleat the dough together will not be super-thick.
Steve1989MREinfo at 5:30
As a HoH fan I was disappointed to see that your subtitles for Closed Captioning seem to disappear once they make it past the initial introduction sequence. Please look into proper captioning services.
Babish just sent me into a youtube MRE video blackhole binging that lasted 4 hrs.
You should actually try MREs

My favorite mre man quotes
What temperature to steam the bao at? Some say it’s at high heat, others at medium?
Is putting cooked food with raw meat food poisoning
FYI: "Bao" = bun(s) in Chinese (we don't differentiate singular/plural for most things, it's just understood).  So, the title is literally "Buns Buns".  Wait a minute, is this a Warcraft ChunTian Spring Rolls reference?  
EDIT: If anyone's having trouble making those pretty folds on top of the buns, here's an alternative: make square-shaped wraps/outer layer.  Put the filling in the middle - NOT TOO MUCH!!!  Fold one corner up to its diagonal corner so that you now have a triangle.  Pull the other two corners together and you now have a yuan bao (gold nugget).  
EDIT: Don't bother measuring Chinese rice wine or cooking wine precisely for that reason... just a dash is fine.
EDIT: Question about the bun... When I use all-purpose flour, the buns for Cha Shao Bao don't turn out quite right like the ones at dim sum.  What flour do they actually use?  Rice flour?
use cabbage in steamer to avoid sticking
5:30 Steve1989 reference!
Here’s an idea, in Pinocchio Geppetto made this meal for Pinocchio and in this meal was this herb butter looking fish for figaro. You should make that.
Is pretty cool that movies or cartoons actually have good food recipes
GOD I would eat 1000 of these but I know I would never have the energy to make some
babish, Your bao dough, is too much, each bao should be wrapped in a thin circle of dough, about 2 or 3mm thick
Maaannnnnn, now I want xiao long bao
Do the meatloaf from Johnny test
Can you make sombitches from how I met your mother
I love this!
Best reference ever babby
You pronounced bao so wrong and the other way you pronounced it, that is plural for bao
Make a dish from the anime One peice
Actually you don't cook the pork, You just mix up the ground raw pork with the vegetable, and then mix them with vegetable.
The ending must have sounded weird for anyone who haven’t seen Bao
Scooby snacks from Scooby-doo
make some fallout food, iguana maybe?
What kind of watch is that? I really like it, plus the episode
Yay you did it!

Awesome suggestion here the sweet buns from shaulin soccer
At 5:32 babish sounded like stevemre
Omg marry me ❤️
Have you made shao long bao (Shanghai pork soup dumplings)? They are perhaps the greatest things on Earth, but take two to three days to make and tend to rip easily on the steamer if not put on napa cabbage leaves. It's worth a try. :)
6:20 oh that pronunciation of baozi is rough 😂😂
LMAO the MRE guy
Please make soup dumplings!!
The tiny whisk is basically all I care about.

can you show how to make hibachi dinner like at bennihana
I would simply eat the finished pork belly, no dough needed :)
Can you raise me as your own child so I can eat what you're cooking?
Thanks
You really have to grind the pork yourself.  Like a fatty shoulder cut.  Store packed ground pork is way too lean.  It will come out dry as paper.
Steve1989mreinfo nod
Did it come to life?
This isn't captioned all the way through.  :/
Schitts creek: Rolands usual order is Fried Chicken on Waffles, Extra Skin

I know it’s very simple, but you have to make the turf and turf from parks and reck
when you say baozi its not bowzee. its bowzoo. but like dont really say the oo part. before you get to the ooh part, trail it off. its almost like when characters in comics have zzzs above their heads. or like a bee buzzing. bao zzzz
Ok, who made captions for one minute but not the rest of the video? Once you have English captions you can't choose the auto-generated captions anymore, so... Not helpful. :(
If you're having trouble pleating and pinching the baozi, try rolling out the dough with varying thicknesses! You can press the ball with your palms into a flattened circle and then rotate the dough with one hand while rolling out the edges with the other hand. This means that you end up with a thicker center (which supports the weight of the filling) and thinner edges (which prevents the top from tasting too dough-heavy and makes the pleating step easier). Another technique you can try is to use the thumb of your non-pleating hand to push the filling back inside while you're pinching and folding.

My body is ready for this

It looks nice for a normal 包 but if you were trying to make 小龙包 the recipe would include frozen soup cubes with every filling....
Never even saw the movie but I clicked on this faster than a jackrabbit breeding on a summers night because that thumbnail was fire. When are you doing to open up a restaurant based off of fictional food.

Can anyone recommend me a alternative for pork belly
YASSSS
Re-watching this, I wanna make that! That said, my home is kosher. I'm wondering if you'd know if I could replace the pork with kosher beef (or chicken, etc.) and if there are any milk ingredients I could replace with something else.
SHE ATe hER SON
They are always called baozi brother : ) Your pronunciation made me laugh, "baozee" haha! Nonetheless the pork look pretty darn tasty :)
Go try Somtum!
I made some of these last night (before knowing about this one).  If you want a fantastic written version of this recipe, check out the Kimchi baozi from Omnivore's Cookbook!

The steve referene
You do know putting any kind of cooked meat the raw meat makes a cross contamination and can get deadly sick hope no one tries this and gets hurt just so y’all know
and now i want dim sum
Not sure why that short made me cry manly tears
theyre called baozi
I am going to try this
Babish I love you, but Baozi is not what they're sometimes called. Baozi is the proper name for them. No one in china just calls them Bao. To further this Chinese lesson, Bao in Mandarin is actually a verb, meaning to wrap up or surround. Not a noun.

Never made Bao think I’ll have to give it a try now!!
Nice steve1989 reference
I’d love to see you do the lamb shanks in rosemary and red wine from the movie Game Night!
The MRE tray reference game was on point haha
At 6:19, I love the try on pronouncing Baozi, but it's pronounced kind of like Bao-tsih, the "ts" being like saying "hats", or like a classic "badum-tsssss"
Oh man that looks soo good!
5:29
Please make a chuck e cheese pizza 😂
360p crew where you at
It’s asian cooking, you eyeball everything
Nice gusset
5:30 wtf was that
I was hoping for this one, those things looked delicious in that video!
But pork belly is more commonly used for siu yok aka the stuff with the crispy skin. A well marbled cut is preferred over the belly which has the fat in layers and will not give the same effect. The most prized cut of meat for the char siew is the 'armpit' cut of the pig., or bu jian tian 不见天. It's between the shoulder and the belly.
If you’re going to do this again I recommend a thinner roll before folding on the edges. It’s just prettier.
YES STEVEMRE

Its a miracle there's even a set recipe. Chinese cooking is at least 50% by feel/rough measurements like using a bowl and looking at the water level
Love me some xao long bao yum.
It's me again, his voice made me pregnant ohmy.
Babish, when you made the frito pie for the king of the hill episode I was wondering if Colby Jack cheese would work? As my experience with the cheese type has a history of unusual melting and uneven patterns in melting trends,
In the bao video, she used a lettuce leaf instead of parchment paper, would have made your life easier there

THE CALLED FU*KING NAPPA CABBAGE NOT CHINESE CABBAGE
I torcher myself by watching this show...  All reminding self that I'll be able make things like this if get ass in gear and get into a real house again :P
You're doing it wrong you are only uspposed to use your hands and chopsticks
Kosher salt > salt
How dare you call it Red alien pork
tip for seasoning dumplings: mix the filling then take a very small amount (like half a teaspoon maybe) and microwave it until it's fully cooked,(it won't take long, keep an eye on it to avoid killing it) then taste it. season remaining filling accordingly.
When you make steamed dumplings in a bamboo steamer, line the inside of it with blanched cabbage leaves! Thats what my Gramma does whenever she makes steamed gyoza, it keeps the dough moist and they dont stick to the bottom and tear.
Babish here a obscure show Three delivery where they are fighting general tso by making his famous name dish.
I’m Chinese and I have no idea how to make a boazi. We usually just go to a Chinese supermarket and buy the pre-made ones lol
U should do Kung fu panda dumplings

Let’s get this out onto a tray...
It's pronounced Bao Zz(uh) with the uh being a very short sound.
Why did he name his caption "BUN BUNS"
You lost me at powdered ginger.  That will NOT be fine.
So impressive!! These are so much harder than they look.
i've always used lettuce or cabbage leaves to steam instead of paper! is paper better?
I really appreciate your use of alliteration @4:15
It is not pronounced baozee it is pronounced like baozut sorta like bowser
Instead of wax paper, use shredded cabbage to line the steamers.  It makes the dough taste better and no stickiness.
Could you do the noodles from naruto please

The Steve MRE reference. So good, so good. Legit laughed out loud. I committed to that lol, Babby.
Not gonna lie, Steve kind of creeps me out sometimes. But I love more videos and hearing a "nice" was, well nice! Weird to hear it from you though.
Tip: when crushing Garlic, crush them first, the dry skin slip will peal off easily that way, or if you crush then chop off the end(root?) the skin will just fall off !
great stuff!
but i think brown sugar is more commonly used instead of honey in east asia.


PS: "bao" itself means bun, so to put bao bun is to say bun bun (nice pet name tho)
Please, please, please do spring rolls. Please. @bingingwithbabish
Can you make the Ube Cake from Steven Universe?
Babish your pronunciation is so cute, it's pronounced "Bao Zih" not "Bao Zee". The i being pronounced the same way as the i in "in" or "ignite". ;)
hey good job with both buns! the first one is more northern with the cabbage and the second one is more southern (i think don't come after me). also definitely DEFINITELY use fresh ginger it makes such a big difference.

I learned to cook largely because I hated my mother's pot roast. (to be fair, I can't beat her pies; classic, american, midwestern, fruit pies that make any god-fearing grown man cry tears of joy. I miss you, mom.)

Hi Babby, I suggest some more sweet dishes to mix it up! Ideally recreate the feast from Chocolat with Juliette Binoche and Johnny D) 😋🍫
Love the word play! To me, that fancy roast had more steps but the first one looked tastier. Thanks for the video! Have a great day!
✌❤
Happy Valentine’s Day, Babby

But Babish, shouldn't you crush the garlic first? Because when you crush the garlic, it's like a two-part apoxy or glue and that creates the allicin, which is what's good for you in garlic.

I believe.

Can you please do more binging with babish with recipes from food wars!
So two things: 

1. I am so glad to see Pot Roast on Basics, this is something that every home cook should have in the arsenal. 
2. Look at that Dutch Oven and all the love that it's gotten, it's good battle scars, is a goddamn workhorse, and I love it!
Babish can you teach me ravioli? I’ll find a show that it’s in so you can make it. Just did a heart shaped ravioli episode for Valentine’s Day and it was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!!!
Wouldn't mine a basics episode with some slow cooker tips, tricks and nice new recipes to try.
You added tomato, blasphemy! 🤢

Aha no justin Y
Can you make the 7 layer Salad from How I Met Your Mother?😂
I'm just gonna suggest adding parsnips to your post roast. Trust me.
This is NOT a roast. A roast uses dry heat to envelope the food causing caramelization. This method is boiling

The confusion that was conveyed when you stopped was hilarious. Even without seeing your face, the confusion portrayed by the simple act of you just stopping made me laugh harder than it should have
What's the second dish called? I don't know how to spell "pottafuh" lmao.
Only 2-3 hours for that size roast?

That pause when the onion went flying was just the best, I keep playing it over and laughing

Is this heaven?
Could you do the Lasagna from garfield

Binging with babish: kosher salt
Bring back the old intro where a clip is played and then it goes right into the episode. This new format is not working out.
Gotta love that Frasier reference at the beginning!
You should make the bon bon from spongebob
Dammit Babish. I literally made a roast yesterday. You should tty making Yorkshire Pudding! Its an amazing pastry.
Ooh Yankee pot roast~ Do you have an earthenware crock pot? That would be great for a lot of your basic videos ^.^

You sound like CPR grey at times :P
Is this technically like roast beef??
Shouldn't use metal utensils in a ceramic coated Dutch oven. It runs the finish

Did you watch the big mouth special, or was the oedipal/edible bit just a coincidence?
Could you make kingdom hearts sea salt ice cream
Cook the sandwich from scooby doo

The French Would be Proud.
Can you make the meatloaf from johnny test
Hey Babby, you're a cool guy, I just want you to know that.
Would you ever consider doing a diet series? Maybe one episode for all of the big diets out there
For example, maybe an episode that follows the Keto Diet?
Your basics video are one of the only things that are keeping me from eating Panda Express and Frozen food forever in College. 😂
Hey Babish, may I ask you something? Why don't you look episode 20 season 2 by how I met your mother? ;)
Next make the chocolate heroin from paradise pd it's from the first episode
Now thats a THICC 🥩😩💦
Love the show, but kind of sad that you didn't gave us the true spirit of un bon pot au feu, which is with whatever you have lying around, and is cheap a souhait !😉
If this is a TV show I'd watch it
First one good
Second one is for tories.
Great content, but I know we are all watching for those forearms
who thinks bensons microwave wings should be made on binging
Looking good Babish my man
Can you try making the Italian food from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure season 3, episode 10, "Let's Go Eat Some Italian Food"
They actually provide an ingredients list, so you can see if the recipes are accurate, or if they just put random shit on there. If it is the latter, you could try to make it your own way, while still remaining loyal to the description given in the episode.
"American as apple pie" not realizing that apple has recipes from 13th century England
I love watching ur videos because ur informative and to the point and funny
Did Babish just have a kid??? The was the MOST dad joke I've ever heard...
Pot roast is a rip off Roast Dinner
Just because the pun: you sir get a like
You should do a video on full English breakfast
i dont want to have bones in my sauce no thanks
Just wanted you to know, watching your show helped me at my weekly bar trivia session. There was a question about the name of a cooking technique used to "dilute meat sediments in a pan in order to make a gravy or sauce, typically using wine."



"Deglazing" of course. 


And the only reason I know that is because of this channel. I may not ever cook any of this stuff but I sure as hell learned a few things!
Happy Valentines from Japan 💕
Will I ever make Babish's more complex dishes? Probably not. But it looks soooo good.
A perfect way to celebrate Valentine's Day. The sure way to a woman's heart, as done by Babish. And oh, Any food from We Bare Bears too for an upcoming Binge.
Can you cook something from the video game monster hunter world
can a single guy cook this and eat it over the sink ? 
.... askin for a friend
I know what I'm making for diner Saturday wooooo!!!
what about an episode for crock pot recipes?
looks awesome, but that's not pot-au-feu
You should do an episode on cooking with wine.
'Fancy ass pot roast' had me dying lol. The pickles are definitely weird and off putting but I'd give it a try
Can I use the bone marrow of my vanquished foes?
Rig juice from regular show
Hey babish you should make a video on Mac and cheese love your videos you inspired me to start cooking
i watch your videos alllllll the time and still don’t understand why you aren’t taken yet 😅 you are so handsome AND can cook !?!? wow . happy valentine’s day 🌹
Great vid as usual ! Pot au feu is really, really not an expensive or fancy dish here in France though. It's more of a basic "whatever winter veggies you have on hand" recipe :)
You should play job sim there's a chef thing in it
3:31 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Happy Valentine’s Day Babbish 😍💜
can you make one of the foods from final fantasy XV?
You should make the burger from the beginning of Resident Evil 2.
Bubba’s shrimp part 2 plzz!! 😭🍤🍤

Did you just said pho is a French soup?
Oedipal you say? More like edible
Sea salt ice cream kingdom hearts 👌
Do the pigs heads from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
Msn I would visit NY just to meet Babish and eat his cooking. 😋
He love his Kosher Salt😂
Idea: SPICED PEACHES FROM HOLES (book/movie). I was always so frickin curious about what those "heavenly" spiced peaches tasted like, and my childhood attempts to recreate them fell kinda flat
Show us the white cake from Django Unchained - Tarantino version.
Ya cant mention your dad without making a dad joke. Well done.
why do i always watch these at 2am, now im super hungry
When you're hungry and watching babish but all you have is microwave dinners.
Happy Valentine's day Babish! Love, love, LOVE Yankee Pot Roast (my favourite pot roast to make).
The correct grammar is "based on" not "based off"
are you ok? your hands are super shaky
Bubba still needs a part 2
You should make a soufflé on this show sometime.
I don’t know how to cook but I love watching your videos
Please please I beg of you babby to do Persona 5 curry because my weeb ass is genuinely curious on how you can pair curry with coffee like they do in the game
I was so worried you wouldn’t but When you used the marrow I got a semi-chub
4:41 what in the actual FSCK?! Smacking your blade against a glass bowl is knife abuse.
you done went and used that carving fork for something other than pasta... Babbish blasphemy.
You are a genius!
Brad is gonna be mad that you didn't crush that garlic a bit.
pls make the sushi from isle of dogs!!!
This cooking show is absolutely fantastic. I love the little side comments you sneak in.
Dude, I want to try that french roast with shanks...  I'm cheap...
I don’t know what type of phò you made but it isn’t the Vietnamese one
"Like most good food it has its roots in France" LOL
I dig the new retro BGM
As someone with a lifelong disdain for celery, can someone recommend me some other vegetables as an alternative
Try mini cooking
The sheer contempt in his eyes when he said 'Let's get down to basics'
This is one of my favorite basics video ever. Besides eggs and pasta. Thanks Babish for bringing not only the basics, but the great food from film and television.
I gasped when I saw the color of those short ribs
How is this dude not married yet. With these cooking skills you would think
And a moment of silence from those who went lonely on Valentines day...
FENG SHUI MASTA 3:54
please do fried chicken basics with Babish
That Oedipus joke you made was the whitest thing I've ever heard you say 😂
After that Oedipus pun I can only assume that Babish got the pot roast recipe by killing his father then seducing it out of his mom.
4:40 oh no baby what is you doing!! Don't tap the edge of a chefs knife on a glass bowl! 😱
I have just started to use short ribs (i love them)...and this looks too good, i must try it now.
"American as apple pie" i love that term because its never used properly, Apple Pie is English 🤣
I love your videos, but this one kinda stressed me out.  There was music in the background, you were speaking much more quickly than usual, and you didn't say "unctuous" even once.  Slow down, Babish, the roast takes like four hours, you got plenty of time to tell me how to do it!
Make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show
I think I prefer the yankee roast. Mainly because i dont really pickles or mustard lol
I liked the delivery on this one,fast paste!
Nevermind, I see Vincent in the basics with babish....
I love watching this while I eat lol. Mmmm 🤤
You should try going on Chopped for fun!!!
Be my valentine, Babish! 😂😂😂
I thought you said "phở "
You have a strong classy watch game. What's the type of watch you have in this video?
Can you make the coffee jelly from The disastourus life of saiki K
Yeah I'm lazy, I'm making the first one instead, thanks man
Gonna be 80 in texas today but back to 40 on monday which seems a perfect time for a fancy ass pot roast.
Ah yes, a classic pot-au-feu, lovely. /slowly takes another bite of kid cuisine
daddy babish blessed us yet again
I'm not fond of that fond you got goin' on

Buddy, that brown wasn't near along

Geddit back the in the pot for some seasonin'

Mild Cheddar isn't the colah, not a medium

You wanna geddit crusty like selenium
Elevator music on point
All Dads approve of the Dad joke.
Am I the only one who sorta thinks Babish is like the Vsauce for cooking. Micheal and Andrew look pretty similar as well.
Why are your hands trembling in this episode?
When I first read the title, I swear I saw “Rot Roast”
do food from the hobbit
Do you have a good recipe for Meatloaf?
Big Smoke’s Order.
What's the French name for the fancy ass pot roast?

Also, I'm assuming you could also make these in a slow cooker right?  Brown in a skillet then transfer to a crock pot? Growing up my mom always made pot roast in a crock pot but the meat definitely fell apart and was kinda dry by the end
when you were describing how one might fall prey to this fancy potroast and never not be able to make it again, it really seemed like you were cumming.
I think that's an outside round roast, not eye of round. Eye of round would not have that piece of grissel.
That watch looks sick where did you get it from?
Are we gonna get these recipes on the site or are we stuck with them in the description of this video?
I would enjoy a few more sweet dishes. How about the dessert trays from Marie Antoinette?
Have you made curry with rice? That would be a good episode I think.
I always think my audio is stuffed at the start of the intro hahaha
Thanks Babish, Kickflips is now causing me to miss phone calls because I'm grooving too much to answer the phone.
Binging with Babish is my favorite way to watch America's Test Kitchen.
I didnt get the opening joke but hey, them pots wont roast themselves
I'm usually with you babs, but that first roast just wasn't it
Do Haggis from Brave
Damn, I love this channel.
being allergic to tomatoes any suggestions for a decent replacement.
YO that plating on the simple roast section!
Would you ever try the Sluzzlewurst from Amazing World of Gumball? Thanks!!!
Hey you should make jontrons turducken
4:13 "flipping the beef".  Happy valentines day everyone
That beard.... is amazing
The intro has a part in where it like rewinds. I'm not sure if you guys know this, because imo it doesnt sound right :3
I thought you said "pot of pho"
I fail to see the parallel between pot-au-feu and the second recipe. Never seen a pot-au-feu with asparagus and complex moves like that, its really a simple straight forward dish! I will steal that bone marrow kinda bearnaise thingie you did cause that looks delicious though! 🤩
Thank you for filling the void in our hearts this Valentine’s Day, Babish.
Like many great foods, not most.
Can you do the brunch foods from that Portlandia brunch episode pleaseeeee
Does the original recipe call for Parsley or Cilantro in it?
You should do some of soma's dishes from the anime
I hope Brad didn't see the uncrushed garlic.
This looks delicious, but nothing beats Mom's 😊
When are you making the good burger?
Where's the slow cooker! I want a crock pot recipe!
The second one is basically identical to Osso Buco
Haha! Loved the ending!
Pot au feu is how i pronounce PDF
Great video, just want to register one comment - very much NOT digging the agressive multiple shots and angles/frequent cuts during the prep and cooking. Really harsh and wrecks the simple beauty of Basics I typically enjoy. Still a great video and I enjoyed it, but if you were testing the waters, I would vote for keeping the editing more tame
Try making the Scottish empire biscuits from the Pixar movie Brave
Andrew, I have been a silent lurking fan for a long while. I love what you do but the change in music today was a problem. It was distracting and didn't work for me. It did not tossed salad my scrambled eggs.
Babby can you make buter brod from the life of boris
You should make the popplers from Futurama
Do a full English or roast dinner
I prefer a well trimmed piece of Chuck for a pot roast. That second one though...mmmm ...

Marry me😍
This is great... unless your GF or BF is a vegetarian.

Any pointers on how to adapt the first recipe for a slow cooker?
Hey Babish!! Would you consider featuring game meats like venison or rabbit? I'd like to see some of your twists on some backwoods style food!!
Dracula! I made pot roast!
See you  next week  Babish!!!
What kind of wok would you recomend? I would really like to make proper pad tai.
"TOSSED SALADS AND SCRAAAAAAAAAAAMBLED EGGS"
Nice Video but the pace seems a bit rushed.
Laaaame, I see no Pot in this recipe
Will make this for my Sunday diner. Thanks
I just love how despite all the weird foods-of-the-moment ridiculous health benefit nonsense, a really popular channel exists where fat is celebrated as flavour.


I like this place, I'm gonna stay a while.
What of English Sunday roast?
You've never had Lancashire Hot Pot, have you?
Beef in a pot? Nah.
Lamb in a pot with melt-in-the-mouth spuds?

Y E S.

Economical (or it was until the price of Lamb shot up, but it's down now I think) 
A local classic for me
and it's got a shoutout in Wallace and Gromit. :^)

Why do I get hard when Babish says "everyone gets nice and soft"?
im too poor to afford that kinda of meat lol but gr8 video :))
That intro though 👌
Question to people who cook: is there a decent non-salt alternative to seasoning and searing beef?  I'm a young-ish guy who's already on blood pressure medication, and every time I wash Babish slather something in salt, I can feel my arteries cringe.
Even you look disappointed with your pun at the beginning there haha
Roses are red 
Violets are blue 
Babish is making pot roast because he loves you😘👌👌
Really expected to see cognac add to that sauce for the 2nd pot roast. Just seems like something the french would do.
You should do the Banh Mi sandwhich from Halloween 2018, that would a rlly cool episode.
Hi, would you say that you cook with an average amount of salt? Or more than most people?
Cause I feel like you use a hell of a lot in all your videos, but then again I don't really have a good reference point... 

As someone who doesn't like their dishes to taste too salty, would you recommend that I use much less than you do?
You should make your favorite soup because I got my wisdom teeth out and chicken noodle soup is getting quite boring
Please sort your saturation out babish! The reds hurt my eyes 😭
Do Vietnamese pho 🍲
wouldn't it be better to cook out the alcohol before you add the beef broth? just wondering.

Finally. Someone else says it just like me (vegetables is the word.) And I've gotten teased over that.

Why do I always find myself watching your videos, when I happen to be starving. :D
I think adding the prices you spent on your ingredients would help some of us home cooks get a sense of budgeting. I know that’s not a focus of the channel, but I’d love to compare price points
You get a thumbs up just for how you said vegetables

Real Life Food War's.
I just can't get behind adding celery to anything. I have always found it powerfully unpleasant. I have heard the "It's basically just water and fiber" argument many times and I'm still wondering what about that is supposed to change my mind on it.  If you like it you can have all the celery you want just leave me out of it ^_^
Great intro!

Definitely gonna try the Fancy Ass Pot Roast. Pot roast is one of my preferred recipes. I always use a chuck roast for it, but watching this makes me want to try the Fancy one as well as some other meats in my more traditional pot roast. Thank you.
What's the name of the french recipe, in writing?
I made the Yankee potroast for a GoT watch party and it turned out pretty great. The only thing I would change is making a bit of a thicker sauce for the roast because mine turned out a little bit bland
Wait, what is he trying to build up at the bottom of the pot?

I followed the first recipe,  but it came out tough, chewy and dry after cooking for 2 hours.  I cut the fat cap off of my roast, should I have left it on?
No joke. I was going to make pot roast yesterday but decided to hold off on it because a family member's diet ends in 2 weeks. I do not know how to make pot roast and too many recipes do too many different things!

Basics with Babish- pot edibles
This is not my usual type of comment, but I've got to say that the whole combination of skills, good taste, voice, humor, organized kitchen, beard and tattoo is straight up sexy.
hey babish, do you think you can do a cultural take on foods around the world? Like Colombia! that would be neat plus many foods to learn about and to experience/experiment
You should put the temperature in celcius too. You know just for the rest of the world.
Absolutely beautiful.

I could see the pain in his eyes as he made that edible joke
Pot roast! Love making pot roast and honestly I hadn't thought to cook it for less time. I'd always figured I was messing up when I couldn't slice it and it fell apart.
I have kind of an odd question, I'm very allergic to red wine, do you have any suggestions for what I can use as a substitute? I'm trying to find a balance between delicious and death. Thanks!
What's with the elevator music?
How do you keep the beef warm for the second recipe? Will it not be cold after cooking all the vegetables?

I wasn't sure but I think i've heard you saying "Pot au feu". And to be honest, at the end, i'm pretty sure it's not a pot au feu. Seems nice thing to eat but not a pot au feu.
Ugh babbi with that Williams Sonoma cookware 😩😩😩

Can we have your dad host an episode some time? Like for fathers day perhaps?
This isn't a classic French pot au feu.  There are some elements there, but pot au feu uses the less desirable cuts of meat, it's traditionally a poor peoples dish, and you only need one pot, a fire, and a couple of hours, none of the fancy shmancy draining, cooking vegetables separately, or making a separate sauce. 
I don't know where this recipe comes from, but it isn't what a French person would think of a pot au feu. Looks great though !
Uhm either dish would be my death row LAST dish before succumbing  into darkness (if i were to be scheduled for execution)....just saying
Look delicious I will be making that tomorrow for my wife and kids.
My mom is making pot roast today for dinner
Oh.... that kind of pot.....
I literally just finished setting up a deer pot roast in my rice cooker when I check my phone to see this video.
This is great timing! I am making yankee pot roast tonight and was wondering what seasonings I needed to add. I have a chuck roast though, how would you alter your times for that cut Mr. Babby?
Hello, Humans. My time on Earth has been interesting. I've met alot of strange beings called Humans. 30 years is a long time, to stay on any planet. Perhaps, I shall move around the universe. I'm never sure what awaits me.

Please go back on GMM the Mythical Beasts miss you!
We have been looking for things to make for (hopefully) regularly occurring, family dinners since my dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and the Yankee roast fit the ticket. We doubled the recipe in order to feed 8 people with minor leftovers. It joined the clean plate club with every single one of us (some twice over). My dad is a real meat-and-potatoes, farm-boy at heart, so the look on his face as he inhaled this was perfect. The only modification we made was to turn the braising liquid into gravy. Thanks for doing this recipe. It was amazing.
Will you please do a video with all the potato dishes from black clover

Trevor Belomont liked this video
I had pot au feu pretty often growing up in Paris. My mother couldn't cook, but she could do that. The best part was always the bone marrow. You'd have it with just a bit of salt on some baguette. (It's almost impossible to find real baguette outside of France, but there are some good approximations.) The way Rea chops up the marrow into the broth is interesting, but I'd be very disappointed if I were offered something that was called a pot au feu but didn't include actual, visible marrow.

The asparagus and the strange sauce are completely his invention, but they can make sense. The lack of visible marrow makes sense too, but it without whole, in-bone marrow the whole thing is just... misleading. (It's not like when he added carrots to bœuf bourguignon. That was criminal and deserved actual reprimand. The ghost of Ms. Child will haunt for that one, Andrew Rea. Your sexiness won't save you this time.)
Am I the only one who hates cooked carrots? I'd add peppers instead, personally.
I know u can add just about any veggie and it’s good but I’ve found cabbage to be the best thing in my roast
an idea is to recreate food from the restaurants in kitchen nightmares
Im aroused.
I have absolutely no idea what you want on the bottom of the pot that rhymes with wand and pond. Probably should leave things like that out of BASICS; That being said, I could also just be an idiot :D
I'm pretty sure that was a cross rib roast, which comes  from the shoulder ,and not an eye of round, which comes from the hip.
Get him on masterchef.
Most people in my family cant make pot roast.
“And I’m very fond of it”
Please do not stir in an emailled cast iron pot with metal tools.
Sorry i for the life of me cant figure out what he was rhyming pond and fond with
Do chocobars from yokai watch.
The souses looks more like a dip
Immediate double take when you said pot-au-feu was fancy. Then I saw this was a very liberal interpretation. Seems good except for wasting the marrow to make sauce. It's a delicate flavour, just a bit of salt on a slice of bread is what you want usually (maybe some pepper). Throwing it in with the mustard is a complete waste.
What is the kind of cut off beef that makes it like barbacoa texture? More like a stew than a roast?
Dude, could you cook the food from Burnt movie?
Can you make Jennys house specialty, from Oliver and company? It’s my most favorite movie and that’s the one food that stood out to me ever since I was little!

Babish wants to go to flavortown
I've grown up with pot roast as a regular staple and... have never enjoyed. Part of me thinks it may be the cut of meat my parents always chose... chuck roast. I'm absolutely stoked to try these recipes and see if I may like a pot roast after all or at the very least the fancy French version of pot roast.
Some people roast meat, I roast myself.😏
Make krusty krab pizza or pretty patties
Why does it look like there's an eyeball staring back at me at 4:04? It looks delicious... I'd even eat the eyeball.
Babby get a new tattoo?
For those who read this, when he braises the short ribs add some guiness or other dark lager with lots of fresh rosemary.
BBSH
I find pot roast disgusting personally.
Those onions with the cloves look like age restriction to me....
Pho is French?
I swear to god Babish, your videos are the sexiest, most delicious things on this website, but I can't stand your accent when you speak French.
Aight
I wish you used a chuck roast
This is about baking. My friends mom used sparkling sugar on a heart shaped pie for Valentine’s Day. The pie tasted. But that’s besides the point. On the top the sparkling sugar stated like a salty kind of topping. Would you maybe able to explain that to me?
Lol I fucked up a nice Rost a few weeks ago using a pressure cooker recipe
ojays
I usually brown the beef a bit in the pan and add everything else to the crock pot and let it cook all day.
basics with babish is life
It would be awesome to see a crockpot episode if you haven’t done one!I don’t have an oven and I have a very small kitchen and could use some pointers.
pot-au-feu is just fancy-ass French pho.... hey waiddaminnit... Vietnam was a French colony, I'll bet there was an etymological connection there.
Oedipal? Did you kill your dad for that pot roast recipe?
That pot au feu recipe hurt my french heart lol the veggies and cut of beef chosen were wrong and also, it's not fancy, it's historically made with cheap cuts and vegetables.
I didn’t know he had a face
Happy Valentines Day Babish!

Just wanted to say, your Pot-Au-Feu isn't exactly what you would find in France. Maybe a version you'd find in a high end restaurant.
Pot-Au-Feu traditionally is a sort of left-overs dish where you would throw your leftover vegetables (potatoes, carrots, turnips, celery, which are all often found in French gardens) and tougher pieces of meat and marrow bones (which we would actually eat on their own with bread!) into some simmering water and just let cook throughout the day. It's actually more widely known as a dish that has it's roots in poverty stricken areas of France (especially farmland during the renaissance) rather than a high end meal, even though it is still served in that setting.

Nonetheless, I have to say your interpretation looks delicious! Joyeuse Saint-Valentin Monsieur Babish et Bon Appétit ;)
What’s with the elevator music?
love it
Is vinny going to be your cameraman
1:21 what was the word he was giving the hint to? i thought it was "flavor." but that doesnt rhyme with wand or pond or fond.
Oh... Ohhhhhh! This is a cooking channel. So the pot... ah yeah.
there's something about this guy that I really dislike. he's so smug
Personally I like just shoving a bunch of ingredients into a crock pot, turning it to low, coming back in 8 hours... and eating that delicious falling apart overcooked stuff with a dollop of sour cream. I'm a heathen I know...
Hey Babish, can you make a basics episode about food safety? For example avoiding cross contamination etc.
Make something Indian loll
Eat it with rice and it’s 1000% better.
Can you make the gumbo from princess and the frog
The onions look like titi's, I'm sorry I'm juvenile. Happy Valentine's day Babish and everyone else who just love getting gift and eating chocolate.💚💚💚😚😚
Would you ever considering doing basics for foods that are more family friendly? I'd love to cook more, and learn how to cook better, and I'm tired of generic recipes from mom blogs. My younger brothers are slightly picky eaters, and we don't really have the time, money, or kitchen space to make 4 hour dinners with the highest quality ingredients, so I feel like some more regular family accessible meal/cooking ideas would be super cool!
anyone who thinks pot roast should be anything like steak has not had "classic" pot roast. there should be no such thing as "lean" pot roast.
Can we see Babish at the Butcher? Who is your supplier and can we get a tour of how and what sorta questions to ask when we get there?
French guy here, “Pot-au-feu” is in origin a peasant dish from the middle-age, and as such it is not a fancy nor expensive dish.  It’s actually really easy to make and is best enjoyed the next day of course 👌The only thing complicated about it is the cooking time which takes forever, so it’s easy to mess up the texture of the veggies.
Do telatubbies
Where is the tossed salad and scrambled eggs video???
What’s the single most expensive item you’ve bought for the show food or ingredient wise??? And if it wasn’t a type of meat, what was the most expensive meat you’ve bought for the show??
If you don't watch basic's with babish just because it's not from a TV Show, you miss out on sooo much
Happy Valentine’s Day Daddy Babish
Not gonna lie Motto Motto kinda liked those chunky veggies.
Hmmm I get the Pot Au Feu was a different take on it but I must say that other than the broth it looks nothing what here in France anyone would call Pot Au Feu. Usually the meat is seared then the veggies and Bone added and everything is topped off with water and stick then slow cooked in a pressure cooker. You then serve the broth with Croutons and then all the veggies and meat with optional, Vinaigrette, Mayo and Mustard. With all the regional variations, so maybe some are more like what you made.

Looked delicious regardless and love the channel! Just wanted to give my two cents.
Is it possible to make ovenless potroast?
You should do another series, I think if your followers sent you in three ingredients you had to base a recipe on it , I think it would be a cool challenge series
Shout out the fake Sade music though
Where is Vinny?
Try a Caribbean style dish please?
In France, pot au feu is the exact opposite of "fancy" "complicated" and "expensive" it's literally supposed to be the cheapest vegetables and the cheapest pieces of meat that we forget in a pot for a while and come back to stuff our faces with 'cause it's still delicious af
Try making Hot Pot

Make weed brownies
Just made one tonight!
I'm french and I've got to say... Pot au Feu is a cheap meal for crowds, at least in France. it doesn't go in the oven and cooks for AT LEAST 4 ours. I guess you can cook you vegetables separately as you did but I don't really see the point.
Omg pls do Ed’s sauce from good burger 150 likes and you have to

What kind of pot is that?
Why does the food in your photos look so bland?

Anyone else hope hes going out of town to record something with Brad?
your are joke very funny i like it
My husband loves watching you he has made some of your dishes for our little family and all of em are delisous but this one, was by far the best dishe we've had by you tonight.
I just started following your channel about a month ago and I love all your webisodes about making dishes from tv shows but have you tried a video game? Final fantasy 15 as well as kingdom hearts 3 has a plethora of dishes on there and want to see if you can do it or if possible!
hey Andrew, may i suggest making an episode of basics about cheesemaking. you could show us how to make ricotta(maybe even include brad leone), mozzarella and maybe even how to make your own american cheese from different cheeses( Dan from america's test kitchen has a video about that)
Worst pun ever. Love it
Can I have a BONELESS pot
Great vid but not gonna lie this is the weirdest looking Pot-au-feu I've seen in a while (I thought you were saying Pho at first, very confused lol). 
Now it doesn't look bad at all, but it's needlessly complicated, Pot-au-feu is a cheap cut of beef like shank or chuck I guess (not familiar with the american cuts) that you throw in a pot with turnips, onions, carrots, leeks, potatoes and marrow bones, the only things you have to mind are skimming and vegetable cooking time. It's strange because some parts of the recipe are really accurate like sinking the clove in the onion (you can char the onion to give more colour to the broth) and others are completely off  the mark like adding asparagus and the tartar-ish sauce at the end (homemade mayo does the trick perfectly, and you usually eat the marrow on bread with salt flakes).


It's a very hearty, simple, cheap dish that should fit perfectly with your Basics series but you presented a sophisticated and non-traditional version, which looks good nonetheless. I'm not sure where you got that "pot-au-feu is super fancy and laborious" narrative lol.
Anyway, again nice vid, nice recipes cheers :)
That joke from the beginning was ripped straight from the Big Mouth valentines day special on Netflix and it DIDN'T EVEN WORK IN THE CONTEXT. Nice pot roast tho.
Apple pie is not American lol
I’m only replying cuz of the way you pronounced “vegitables “
Not ruined enough, Andrew! Now there won’t be any steamed hams.
the "beware of flying onions" was cute, because there's no way a viewer would've seen what you're referring to, it just seems like an odd thing to say but flies off, melts into the video, goes unnoticed as a thing you said. but upon further inspection YES, there is a flying onion piece in the clips shown today. It's cute because it's inadequately showcased, it's easy to miss and hard to see. It's not "professional" by some definitions, to just mention a thing but not adequately showcase it. But it adds to a certain ouvwah of this video, this channel, to not be as precise as needed. Or, in other words, it's cute. I love it.
Am I the only one who has never ate pot roast before?
Am I the only one who thinks pot roast should be cooked in a crock pot?

Can you do white bean chili, and potato soup.
Hm... this video makes me wonder what sort of kick ass stew Babish can make (other than the red dead stew).
the most time consuming roast I've ever made was a lamb shoulder roast. Which consisted of a 6 pound lamb shoulder on top of a bedding of sliced portabella mushrooms, halved tomatoes, slivers of Vidalia onions, small Yukon gold potatoes and plenty of fresh green beans with a couple cloves of garlic, two bay leaves and a conservative grating if ginger before stacking up the lamb, scored on top about a quarter inch deep, just because I felt like it and rubbed with classic Italian seasoning with some extra rosemary and celery salt.   I cranked the oven to 400 for the first 30 to 45 minutes before dialing it back to 250 for the rest of the six to seven hours, being sure to baste it every hour. this resulted in a tender, almost fall off the bone roast that wasn't crumbly with a beautiful brown crust . And it was a bit of a gamble, but the tomatoes and mushrooms didn't shrink or dissolve because the lamb excreted so much juice. so much in fact, I was able to make a gravy from it that paired excellently with cranberry bread and red wine. It was definitely inducted into the clean plate club between ten people (it was Christmas).  The sexiness in this roast is that it took eight hours to finish.
ZowiE!!!
how do you combat burnout dude. i can't even take out the garbage without falling apart for a week. up to the audience to decide if that's an exaggeration
Try making Blormed Milk from chowder the cartoon.
Babbish, can you make the Pepper Jack Turducken Slammer from Supernatural
Its funny cause Apple pie is English not American
What do your tatts mean
3:11 looks weird and i can remember some memories when i was just a baby
And they say white people dont season their food
Apple pie isn’t American, it’s English..
Babish the whole thing of bringing a steak to room temperature is bullshit. Plus a roast would at most change temp by a few degrees over the course of an hour, so completely pointless to do it outside of the fridge. Come on man, you should know this basic stuff.
Ever thought of making Julia Child's Beef Bourguignon? From Julie & Julia?
I cook this dish for myself way too often. it’s just too good to not eat every other week.

My girlfriend is a vegetarian and she asks if you would make a vegetarian meal
Can i tell a story....this kid always complained about his parents and everyone would ask about it...and he would say they were either the best or the worst....but he still loved them.....he would get mad at anyone that said they hated their parents....this man grew up to bd obama trump
I still don't understand why you Americans think apple pie is American.
Hey if you ever want a beef stew recipe that will literally make your tongue roll out like a cartoon from Looney Tunes, send me a message.
Lol POT roast
I prefer to use a chuck roast, and cook it in the crock pot till it’s falling apart when I stick my fork in the middle. It’s the way my dad makes it and I live for it! I’ve been told by many ppl it’s the best pot roast they have ever had! looks like I’m making pot roast this weekend bc I’m craving it now!! 😋
Why don’t we use ginger more.
I feel like adding in sound effects at rare fail time would funny up the videos even more. Imagine a cartoon ricochet sound when the piece of onion went airborne.
Try making steak and Guinness pie for st paddy's day

Hey vsauce, micheal here
I like to roast my pot too.
How would you make the Yankee roast in a crock pot? Would you have to just do everything in a skillet and pour it in? The only pots I have have glass lids so I don't think I can put them in the oven
Damn those peppercorns look pathetic fr

It doesn't 'have its roots in France', stewing meat is a more or less universal culinary technique. If anything, it was something brought to the Colonies by British settlers.
Please don't dilute a broth like that
Makes pewdiepies meatballs
Good ol pot
American as apple pie, so.... not at all?
My biggest problem with this kind of cooking that takes several hours is cold food. Like i don't want to stick the meat in the microwave after I've taken time to cook the vegies, but would it lessen the tenderness or consistency of the meat to stick it back in the oven to warm up? What do?
“fancy ass pot roast” lmfaoooo

Potatoes and molasses
I would always put a butt in the slow cooker for 24hours along with some onions garlic potatoes and carrots and a layer of rice on the bottom to soak up all the juices and broth but this looks good too
what do red potatoes taste like?

Be informational or be funny. Or just stop trying to be funny all together. You're not Alton Brown so stop trying to be.
You're a competent cook... why are you using that crap stock from a box?  Get rid of that stuff and teach people the right way please.
I've never quite made pot roast like this: too much work for me. I usually take a chuck roast, 'cause they're super fatty, and throw it in my slow cooker all day smothered with spices and using broth instead of water. My grandma likes her roasts like this, though.
Geoffrey Chaucer printed an apple pie recipe in 1381, long before colonies revolted and became the US, so as American as apple pie needs to be stricken from the vernacular.
When u cook the second dish are the potatoes and carrots soft
Little do you know Ireland literally lives of a undignified version of this, boiled to a swampy mush, devoid of flavour.
What do you guys say: potato or potato, tomato or tomato?
Pot roast is not American... It is French ....period. Just ask the host of Cubans with French roots where they learned the dish from (which is a staple of cuban food). Yeah ... Im pretty sure Americans didn't come over on tiny little boats to teach them ... Haha hahaha
I was raised by my grandparent's. So whenever we had a little extra money in the middle of the month or beginning of the month we'd have a pot roast on a Sunday after church. My grandma would wash some potatoes & carrots then cut slits into a couple large white onions. She had some water in the roaster & pop it all in the oven with the roast. By the time we'd get home from church the roast would be done & that would be the meal for the whole day.
I miss her cooking. She passed away 5 years ago.
There’s a Simpson’s episode where Bart tries to make his own hot chocolate,  but the marshmallow absorbs the drink so he eats it with a fork and knife. You should try to recreate that.
You should make the food in the bakery of Jojo's Bizarre Adventures:Diamond's Unbreakable episode 21 😋🍞

I have so many amazing memories eating pot roast with my family when I was younger. We used to fight over who got the most potatoes and carrots, and with our pot roast it was classic in the crock pot all day the house smelled of meat and broth and oh it was heaven. I remember eating this at my grandmas house and my families house and my other grandmas house... Oh this meal has alot of memories. I really want to try the fancy version it looks deliciousss
I made SpitRoast today with my girl and my best friend😎
Wow, even tho the meat raw, it looks good

Can you do kidney cleanse juice? I would love to watch it😃
Man, even your simple pot roast is fancier than mine! I just take about a quarter of a pork loin, salt it, and stick it in a crock pot on low over night with just enough water to cover it. Then add roughly chopped, unpeeled potatoes and baby carrots in the morning and let cook until dinner time.
Hey Babish, where did you learn to cook? Just curious.
Where I grew up classic pot roast is very different
Babish I challenge u for 4mil shave your beard off
Yeah uh I'm have to stop you right there Babby... Pot au feu is the quintessential french poor food. You're supposed to use the off cuts. like oxtails, tongue, shanks etc... The fancy schmansy version you've posted comes from people who really don't understand a thing about pot au feu. It's supposed to be rich, filling and contrasted only in texture
U should have been done this a looooong time ago instead of those crappy ones u been doing..... Ur slipping babby
I mean you're fancy ass Pot Roast looks super good but its not a ''Pot au feu'', Pot au feu is suposed to be a dish made by the poor during the middle ages, it was certainly the best dish they could make, and also once a month but it is super cheap for our standards. In france it is still made during winter but its only made with cheap cuts of beef and vegetables .
You call « pot au feu » fancy? 😂 I’m french and trust me, pot au feu was invented by poor people a long time ago. It’s definitely not fancy! We make it every winter and it’s not difficult to make, you just « decided » to make it look fancy. The recipe is just vegetables and meat, cooked for a long among of time with some herbs, that’s it. 
I love you channel and your videos for sure, recipes look amazing but trust me, real pot au feu is nothing but fancy. 😊
😂😂😂😂 what were you doing with those onions hope it doesnt get demonitized. Happy Valentine's Day Babish
Just me but I prefer the classic version of Pot Roast over the Fancy One.
For total cook time on the yankee roast you say 2-3 hours, with an additional 45 mins bringing the total time to 2-3 hours. Think you meant bringing to 3-4 hours
Oh yea first 280 comment

That's like £10 to 15 worth of beef.  Not many single people would make this let alone a family as that's one meals worth of food.
Happy Valentine's day daddy babish
I don't know if I can eat all of that alone on my valentines date tonight...
Noice
Stupid question: what was he referring to that he was trying to build up on the bottom of the pot? Rhymes with fond?
My grandma used to make pot roast! It was more like a beef stew, but this brought back so many memories! My grandma does't cook so much anymore since she got in a car accident around two years ago,  but it's my goal to one day before I move out get all of her recipes and learn to cook them from scratch like she used to. I want to spend a full day with her in the the kitchen and try and learn some of the stuff and maybe copy some of the old recipes she has from my grandma's old cookbooks before they become unusable.

Music was a bit overbearing in this episode babi, just my two cents. Distracted from what you were saying
HOHOHOHOHOHOHO
My grandma used to make a big pot roast every time we'd visit. Pretty sure it was always a little dry but she'd shave it thin on a meat slicer in the basement and some pieces where nice big thin pieces and some shredded a bit more and served with some gravy. There was nothing better. There something about pot roast, man.

I love pot roast!
Ummm...Your so sexy!
I like the jazzy porno music, it's a nice touch.
I know I’ve mentioned this recipe on some food channel but I can’t remember if it’s Bon Appetit, Sorted, or yours but the ultimate way to cook a beef roast and what every kitchen I worked in did is: 

Throw your roast on a 5-600• grill until crosshatching sears into the meat, then move to your prep table where you salt it, and generously massage it all over with either Dijon mustard or Grainy Mustard—-I recommend the latter, then roll it in Montreal Steak Spice and mirepoix, a little liquid and the roast. We did 400 for 25 mins and 325 for the other 25-ish minutes. Let it rest and you have a beef roast so happy to see you it’s blushing.
I like your watch. What is it?
Whooo
I know it might be a dumb question.  But will the alcohol burn off?

That three vegetable medley is pretty classical for French cooking not everything else every place has a variation on it New Orleans change to a pepper thing, we Chinese don’t bother unless you use soy or vinegar, Japan is miso and soy, the point is study every cuisine out and understand how food works or watch Anthony bourdain’s no reservations and bizarre foods with Andrew Zimerman trust me food ain’t what you think it is and is very different around the world.

This is a really obscure request... I don't know if you've ever seen the Disney Channel Original Movie classic that is "Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off", but I have, more than I'd like to admit. I would absolutely LOVE to see your interpretation of the iconic "sauce".  In the movie it's described thus: "like barbecue sauce, but better!") ... so it could be a cool way to talk about barbecue sauce styles (white, vinegar-based, etc.). I just can't imagine how you'd make it purple! Ube barbecue sauce maybe? I'll leave it to you.

Forever requesting the Lost Boys’ spread from Hook ;)
The way you hold a fork terrifies me.
Did you just eat half a block of butter?
Any pharmacy can easily order you a mortar and pestle.
I've made this 3 times now and I'm addicted to it. Every time I fix it the result is a little better, as I slightly tweak the recipe. Absolutely the best meal you've prepared on this channel, imo.
Babby, dawg: you overcooked that steak.
Can you make noodle soup from Kung Fu Panda? Or the king size dumpling from that too
Loved the recipe and all but what is this way of holding the fork???
Adding some butter...... *adds half a stick of butter😱

Can you do baozi from pixar's Bao?
It's so awesome to hear that one of your culinary heroes is Alton Brown! What you made today was almost certainly Good Eats.

Remy’s soup from Ratatouille!
Kosher salt with Babish.
Babish, you have never disappointed me until now. 

A meal like that should never be served with a blended scotch, single malt only. I think Archer would agree...
Hot Take..   I'm guessing the bottle/drink was Glefiddich 14.

Well done Babish!!

Would love to see a cross-over episode with you and Claire over at Bob Appetit in the future.

Dude, you should do sea salt ice cream from Kingdom Hearts, especially now that 3 is out and it's selling like crazy. 
Always wondered what that would taste like

Babish, you should try making jelly donuts that look like Japanese rice balls, in honor of the infamous localization in the 4Kids dub of "Pokemon."
The song is a bit NSFW, but the "Ultimate Sandwich" from Ninja Sex Party's "The Ultimate Sandwich" sounds pretty... well... ultimate.

I'd love to see you do it.

tiny whisking / verb / ['taɪni ˈwɪskɪŋ]
Babby for using the iconic 'tiny whisk' to incorporate instead of something appropriately sized - cause that would be silly
With all that butter I was expecting the racist Butter Gremlin that used to haunt the Food Network to appear.
Did he just say Archer might be a terrible person???!!!


There’s no way you can think Archer MIGHT be a terrible person

Because he’s definitely not.
Mr. Rea,
Would you do me a solid, and recreate the perfect candy from the American cartoon Jimmy Nuetron!!! It combines several elements of different candies, and I think you could have alot of fun doing various versions of it!!! I love watching you improve on the recipes you feature!!

My brain: Steak po-ee-vray
How much would it cost to have you as my personal chef?🤤
You should do the mince pies from Sweeney Todd!!
Pro tip: it's winter, and oranges are deliciously in season. Instead of some stale big box brand OJ, cut an orange in half and squeeze!
Could you attempt to make the ‘Winchester Surprise’ from Supernatural as appetising as possible. 

Apparently it’s a casserole, yet I cannot picture how the below ingredients are meant to a. Look or b. Taste, when combined into a meal. 

Ingredients according to Samantha Smith, who plays Mary, Sam and Dean’s mother:





 

I know you can make it not only edible but delicious - after ‘milk steak’ I have absolute faith in you!

4:10 That was not cognac! That's E&J VSOP and you know it Babish!
I'd have a beer or 12 with this guy.  First eggs Woodhouse, now this?
Your youtube videos are getting more entertaining while being less informative. Slippery slope.
Its winter here in Canada and I'm dying to fire up the bbq and cook a good prime cut steak.
Shout out to archer and A.B. love it!
Simpson’s donut or rice balls from Pokémon!!!!
Why are you grinding pepper for the sides instead of using the sifted out pepper from earlier?

Can you please make the foods in Monster Hunter?
You should guest star H.John Benjamin.

Do the heavy’s sandwich from team Fortress 2

Pls make the chilli dogs from The Simpsons
in honor of the lunar new year, you think you can make the steamed buns from shaolin soccer? using taichi ofc ;)
STEAKS EVERY WHHHHICH WHHHAY.  Stewie would be proud.
Nobody: 

Babish: BUTTER
for anyone not sure, the temp for medium rare steak is 50 Celsius (or 55)
Archer is the perfect example of a glorious bastard: a horrible person, but a delightful character.  The sort of person that's a joy to watch...from afar.

I feel like rosemary would have worked well with the carrots, and perhaps made them fit better with the scotch.  Then again, I'm not exactly an expert in scotch.
Instant respect and a comment because you said its good but not worth $200 a bottle.
Because I completely agree.
This would have worked perfectly well with whole peppercorns. You just cant eat them.

Suggestion: liver and fava beans with chianti from SotL. You could probably substitute the human liver with pork.
Flan from Kingdom Hearts 3
I’ve never watched archer but I had no idea he was voiced by Bob from Bobs Burgers. Not what I expected at all lol. That would make it hard to watch.
I'd say steak au poivre is in the top 3 staple dishes in restaurants in Belgium, together with steak aux champignons.
I'd say steak au poivre is in the top 3 staple dishes in restaurants in Belgium, together with steak aux champignons.
The Alton Brown reference small as it was made me very happy.

This channel looks like a good place, to find some ingredients.
I would pay so much for you to cater my wedding 🍴
Do the wasabi chicken wings from the Simpsons!! The episode is called “All is fair in oven and war”.
The bottle looked far more life Glenfiddich than Johnnie Blue. Just saying.

To me the bottle looked more like Glenfiddich 14
I would treat myself to the best restaraunt in the city the day gordon ramsay comes on in this show..

All of this butter reminds me of the ending of the South Park gluten episode
I think you used a whole cow worth of butter for this one.  Ye Gods, man, I can feel my arteries hardening from here!
So if I want to make this, the first thing I need is about 40 lbs of butter. Im okay with that.
I find a great alternative to regular peas are pea pods/sugar peas. Sauteed in butter and a little bit of pepper they are amazing, and have a nice crisp texture.
Gourmet Big Mac?
I feel like Babish needs to slow down by like 10%, but that may just be the whiskey talking.
Good eats is my all time favorite cooking show
Can you make the cupcakes from The Cat in The Hat
Despite the name of this recipe. With all the butter and cream, it's actually a dairy dish.

You could have used the peppercorn shavings for the vegetables instead of using the grinder.
Do Tyler the creator's waffles!!!
i’d imagine anything would taste good with that much butter lmao. love u babby

You bought that whiskey just to flex. I would too.
Sizzling shrimp fro Chuck!
This was the first time I’ve ever tried to make something from a cooking video/show. This was absolutely delicious! Just made a HUGE mess though 😂
I’ve never watched archer so seeing an “attractive” character while hearing Bob belchers is very conflicting
"Archer might be a terrible person, but the guy knows how to eat."

mood
Archer is the nicest guy I think I know.
May I have more butter with my butter?
Don't know if you take requests from comments here but... Sweet and Sour Peasant Soup from The Birdcage would be a sure hit.
This recipe is ridiculously aligned with Archer's personality.
Archer has the same voice as the Arbys guy.
Let add that butter nice! Mmkay!
You should do something from Brooklyn 99, I feel like there’s a lot of options
This is like my perfect meal. Just add bread and wine.
I'd love to see you try and make the purple sauce from 'Eddie's Million Dollar Cook Off!"
Please make The Stinky Sandwich from Home Improvement!
Always thought Glengoolie blue was supposed to be a mix of Glenfiddich (due to it have the exact same bottle design) and blue label. They just combined some very well known whiskeys together for their spoof.
"What happened, did somebody steal your Sweet Roll?" - Skyrim city guards are forever worrying about them, how about making this iconic Bethesda game treat?

🔵Please do blueberry filled chicken wings from Sanjay and Craig!🔵
Okay be honest, who watches these videos and doesn't make any of these foods.
You should do the small version of "Cuisine a la Carte" from One Piece. The chef in that show reuses ingredients that are usually thrown away and I think it'd be a little insight on the wastage of produce Americans put out each year as well.
Archer is not an awful person....he's just drawn that way.
Can you please make Eliot Spencer's sandwich from "Leverage"?
You could easily voice Archer
It's been a while since you got your  Babish tattoo, how is it doing?
Babish, love your show but I always figured that Glen Goolie was closer to Livet or Fiddich. A traditional single malted "glen" scotch. Blended scotch is anathema
Glenghoulie sounds an awful lot like Glenfidditch. That said I don't know shit about scotch and have never tried any before. I am poor.
Blue Label shade made this episode even better. Nice.
that was the most labour-intensive way to cook baby carrots
Looks delicious!  Random question:  where did you find that glass?  I've been looking for a really nice glass for special adult beverages.
It's always a good day when Babish uploads

Where's the lamb sauce

Jesus christ dude how are your arteries after all that butter lmao

Unlike Eggs Woodhouse, it made it into the clean plate club.
I LOVE Johnny Walker Blue Label, my brothers friend brought it to his bachelors party.  Never before have I had whiskey that was so smooth you could drink it like water.  Super expensive, I will most likely never have it again, but it was great.
Are you a professional chef or is this your passion that you keep as a hobby?

If you ever plan on doing more video game foods, the Meowstar chef from Monster Hunter World would like to have a word with you.
I Veganize this Dish by replacing the filet with Romanesco and the cream with cashew cream.  Butter is easy to sub with earth balance and only use about 1/3rd of what is called for.
Just add Au to any combination and make it sound french.
Try sweet bread alla gusto or whatever thst was called from rattatoui

I would actually say the whisky he is drinking there is more akin to a Glenlivet 18 year Single Malt
Omg the Alton Brown reference
weird thing to say buttt i would love to see the waffle house in the cafe scene from the 50 first dates....
That poor steak got cooked to death.

The carrots look bomb though. That looks like an amped up version of how I learned from Julia Child. Put them in a sauce pan with water up to half the level of the carrots, cook with a cracked lid til the water is gone, then top with salt, a big knob of butter, and some parsley.
I really liked the part where he added the butter
This isn't Steak au Poivre.
No joke... I don’t even watch that much Archer (although it is great) but this episode happened to come on today (Season 4 Episode 9 “The Honeymooners”) and I saw that scene and was like... “Oh shit”.
I thought it was sausage on the thumbnail
How do you get the flambé to show so well on camera?

Why do you use the torch to start the flame instead of tipping the pan?
Was that an Alton brown reference?
I just ran across this video and was so tickled! My bf made this for me for Valentines day! <3 Before then I'd never heard of it. Also, it's AMAZING for anyone who wants to try. Especially with Roquefort chive sauce.. mmmmh!
It might be expensive, but it is totally worth that price.
Love the Alton Brown reference!

Wait, only one bottle of Johnny Walker Blue?  I thought you bought three?

Hey Drew! I want to thank you. I have been an avid YouTube viewer for the last 2 years since your Szeschuan Sauce episode.
 Your videos have taught me alot during the time I've been dishwashing to move through kitchens (even a dine-in theater!)
 I'm happy to inform you, I'm looking forward to 2 Line Cook interviews this week, one of them for Dave&Buster's.
  Again, thank you for making your channel as easy to binge on as "Firefly." You have taught me skills as much as that show has taught me moral and selflessness. It would be interesting if you would be able to recreate the meal from the Pilot Episode of the show that started more "Binge Watching."

Looks like I need a refresher course for the breakfast menu. I better touch up on a few episodes, like Eggs Florentine, so I can be up to par for an elcletic morning spot called Baja Cafe in Tucson. Did you know Tucson has just been named a World City in Gastronomy?
needs more butter
damn those carrots had my mouth watering :p
You should definitely make Kevin’s feast from the office (when he made a bunch of movie food before Pam went into labor)

Ed sauce from good burger please
The Good Eats reference though
Can u make ratatouille
Your fillet was at least medium well, you let it rest too long.
I feel this is a little late, but I think you should try to make the meals from monster hunter world. I think it would be a fun challenge to give more attention to what I feel is an amazing game.
Adding this video to my favourites even though i have no plans of doing this thing in the near future.
who else thinks bensons microwave wings should be made on here
Good eats was my childhood you are a true classic man
200 $$ a goddamn bottle... Yeesh

Glengoolie Blue is obviously a nod to Glenfiddich 14, though. Bottle design, male animal logo (bull and stag respectively) and all.
mint and peas babish? you sure?
We need some tiny whisk merch
You seriously went out and bought a $200 alcohol just for that one shot at the end of the video? 
(Haha I just realized “shot” could either refer to the video clip or to the actual drink)
“And let those flavors get to know each other”. Otherwise known as the quote on The head stone of Binging with Babish
Archer is a horrible person? What're you talking about?!?!
That's too much butter

The posh version of milk steak.
Can you do an episode about salt water taffy
Wow....and we all thought Julia Childs was obsessed with butter
my cooking idol babish loves my other cooking idol alton brown??? i love life
You should do a House special. There's a few episodes in the later season where he has an obsession with cooking, and he makes dishes such as multiple types of Ragu, gnocchi and "unhatched chicken eggs... I'm sucking out some of the yolk and replacing it with ragu."
There is so much butter in this episode. Paula Dean would love it.
not enough butter
I'm wondering why you keep setting the liquors you cook with on fire even though you often mention how pointless it is. I mean, I guess it's sorta-kinda-not-really-all-that-cool, but I don't see you juggling your food as if you're in a Benihana's either.

Also, damn, that looks good. And just the right amount of butter for a French dish.
Holy butter
Enjoying the excessive verbiage of this episode
Can you subsitiute cognac with more bourbon?

So butter and liquor. I'm surprised there wasn't butter added to the drink at the end.

Can you do Undertale foods
👍 sangat menarik niii
I’m still waiting for the cereal episode
I love Alton brown too
Calm down with the butter Paula dean
May suggest making something from Steven Universe? Like the together breakfast, the dog nut, the pizza bagel, the fantastic fries, or the ube roll.
you know it's too it's a bit too healthy with all the butter that's been put into it won't you just put 58 cups of brown sugar that definitely make it a bit unhealthy but then make sure to research salad and go to the doctors
It wouldn't be French cuisine if you didn't eat the equivalent of a stick of butter.
Show us your pork
Cheesecake basics?.....
you really love butter? Don't you?
who taught you how to hold a fork?
Been a chef over 35 years , thats not how I prepare au poivre  , the steak SHOULD be encrusted with peppercorns before being panseared , then flambied and carved tableside
Paula Deen would be proud with the amount of butter used
Thats a shit load of butter. Better save this one for special occasions.
Go on masterchef
Was that three sticks of butter??
YUM...
I’m 17 can I use something other than bourbon ? 
I mean I CAN get some just not legally
Steak au poivre is absolutely amazing if you add shallots to the sauce and brown the steaks quickly in a hot pan with olive oil before finishing cooking them in the sauce. This is a good recipe but you want the steak and the sauce to really come together as one instead of having to dip it in like fries and ketchup
Ok well what happened to the peppercorn why crush them and not use them??
Try key lime on the carrots some time.
It’s not an Archer spirit without the clinking of ice. Every episode. Whether you like water in your whisky or not.
I want this for my dinner
Huh you like butter dont you ?
That was delicious chef. Now make "Eggs Wodehouse" from Archer.
Has Binging with Babish ever used a Steam Juicer?

Not gona lie, the steak didnt look good this time round
is it just me or is babish secretly archer
Why is the meat not fully cooked
Binging With Butter
Personally, I would dry the carrots off first. When I dumped them out of the bag they were dripping with condensation and all that water in the butter turned it into a watery broth, of sorts, and it kinda boiled and spattered instead of simmering pleasantly.
Alton Brown reference !
Can you make the krabby hot dogs, pizza, noodles, tacos from that spongebob episode that got fired from the krusty crab?
Do more food wars stuff
Is the guy who plays Archer the same guy who plays Bob from Bob's burger?
Make butter beer from Harry Potter
Idk if I'm right but if my YouTube education is right doesnt your body absorb the beta keratin better with butter ?
How does curing in salt prevent drying out? I was told to only salt steak just prior to cooking as due to osmosis, water will be drawn out of the meat if applied too early. Surely this would reduce the juiciness of the steak?
New sub here...and here comes the binge watching.
Nice Alton Brown Reference
babish loves his f r e s h l y  g r o u n d  b l a c k  p e p p e r
i made the steak and carrots featured here tonight. didn't cook the booze out of the carrots completely- but the steak was phenomenal and the sauce was fantastic. thank you for inspiring me to cook, Babish!
Let me just check when you crush the pepper -  I don't know if you grade it, but coarse?
Can you make Ratatouille from... Ratatouille
Alton Brown FTW!
I don’t trust people that put onions in peas.
Calm down there Paula Deen.

Your pan needs a little Barkeeps Friend on the outside there, ya Babish!
See what babs didn't know is we all saw him put that shallot in after the peas
PLEASE! FOOLS GOLD FROM WHAT IF
he sounds like archer
Liked it 5 seconds in.
Replacements for Butter?
Babish is high key a snack
Episode ideas:

Parks and Rec wedding vendor food poisoning 

Scooby doo any feast with Shaggy, must include malts with the gang

Even Stevens: Beans’ bacon addiction could make a good bacon episode with multiple recipe variations

When Harry Met Sally pastrami or brisket sandwich

Archer: bear claws for Pam, soup from Killing Utne, food from fictitious show Bastard Chef with Antony Bourdain 

Friends: Monica’s candy, jam, Rachel’s English trifle
u hold your fork weird
Yo Babby I’d love to see the cake from Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life
this does not look that professional
I made this recipe and it was almost perfect.  I had some serious questions about the carrots, though:
I've made them a couple times, I'm having trouble keeping the sauce from breaking. I tried cooking it as low and slow as I could, but eventually the milk solids separated out of the butter. Even if I cooked it low enough, the heat from burning off all the bourbon was enough to break the sauce. 
-Could you do this in a slow cooker, where you can REALLY go low-and-slow? 
-Could you par cook the carrots so they don't spend so much time in the butter?
-Would it be better to saute the carrots in a little butter, and add more when it's time to make the sweet sauce? I found that adding more butter seemed to help keep the sauce emulsified, but it's already a hell of a lot of butter. (Also, if there is more carrot surface exposed to the bourbon flames, you get a little bit of brown burny bits on the carrots. Delicious.
-If the butter DOES separate, is there any way to get it to re-emulsify, or just not be a grease slick?
-DAMN is this tasty, though.
We noticed
Whoa whoa whoa!!! We gonna talk about those shallots!!!
why didnt you season the steak with pepper
I thought the steak is crusted with the peppercorns in Stak au Poivre, or have I been eating it wrong?
The lunch scene in aviator movie so mouth watering
Can you make green eggs and ham by dr.suess next
If you add orange juice to anything... it makes the whole thing taste like orange juice. Some people like that.
hi sir why dont you try a filipino food like adobo,tinola,nilaga, ahaha by the way im a big fan of you from philippines
North Korean’s aren’t intelligent
Why is that steak so over cooked babs?
Jesus christ the butter tho...
Forgot the dijon mustard.
As someone who almost doesn't buy any processed foods anymore, I can't help but notice the huge amount of salt you added to the individual components. Does coarse kosher salt have less sodium than regular table/sea salt or am I just not used to it since I also find most restaurant food quite salty?
I don't like beans tofu is much more better try it
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuk
WOuld it be possible for you to do the massive plate of food from Monster Hunter World? It always looks so good in game. Would love to see you cook something from a video game since you have from movies and tv shows and even anime.
I don't know if this is cutting corners too much, but why not just microwave some steakums and add a can of cream of mushroom soup?
Why do I feel like I've just watched dirty-talking porn? 😶

Isn't this technically steak Diane?
Kinda disappointed you did make chinchilladas, but hey, new way to make carrots.
all these mistakes, somewhere in the universe, Alton Brown weeps.
Have you done the everything burrito from adventure time yet?
I think you should finish the filet in the oven instead of the pan. Filet looked a little dry on the edges. This will not happen if you broil/oven finish at 180/200* C. But nice video!! Also why discard the fat from the pan and add butter at the end? The bakingfat is much more flaverfull than the butter i think. For the rest really nice video!!
Hey Babish, I just subscribed last night! Think you could make some Haggis from the movie Armageddon? Good luck making a delicious version. Lol
Great recipe ✌️
Really good episode made
Does anybody else not hear how babish and archer sound almost the same!?!?
Something something danger zone?
The appearance of tiny whisk makes me forget how much I hate peas.
Archer is the guy from family guy.!

Not enough butter.

This is what I imagine corporate  ballers ate in the 70s until they died of heart attacks at 40 years old.
eating pizza rolls
Thank you Babish for being the only person on the internet who says "paper towels," instead of "paper towel" when using more then one. I get it, they're all connected together, it just sounds like a fork on a plate to hear someone say "now wipe your steaks down with some paper towel."
I didn’t notice the shallot
le butter au poivre
Are they veal steaks? They are such an odd colour?
Typical french dish my mom used to make during the week ... The good old times ; as a college student, I now nourrish myself of instant noodles. Is my frenchness is disappearing like my sleep ?
1:25  "Let's start with the carrots." puts down the carrots and takes the peas
Blue Label for anyone wondering is an awful scotch for the price. This should definitely be under $100 per bottle. Save your self some money and get a much better scotch like a Glenmorangie 18 year very rare. It's a good deal cheaper and has an incredible pallet
Man I’ve been watching you for I while and I really enjoy your stuff...I think it would be really cool for you to audition to be on chopped. Since you are always making some kind of weird food, I bet you would probably win😁
Glengoolie is Glenfiddich. Also there's a few people on Etsy that you can get the labels to stick on a bottle
Babish should make those recipes from Tai's mom in "Digimon: The Movie" - especially the "beef jerky shake".
Bingle
GOOD EATS!

Since you already did sandwich that Fitz loves from Agents of SHIELD, how about another look and you do mushroom soup that Lance Hunter describes in 3x17 while being interogated?
I'd love to cook this dish, butter don't want a heartache. It would be butter if there was a slightly healthier way to cook the meat. Butter do understand that the flavour is enhanced by the carrots.
I watched this video yesterday, and last night I had a dream that my mom made me this for dinner. For what it’s worth, I thought it tasted pretty good.
if its not well done its not done at all
Cheesy Poofs from South Park?

ok
But whatever you do, don't use the freshly ground pepper obtained and discarded at 01:01 on the carrots at 02:20 or on the peas at 03:21. Just keep that little dish of extra pepper on the counter forever.
Do the holographic meatloaf from Spongebob.

Wrong
$200 for a blend whiskey, seriously? There's single malts out there for so much less that can give so much more.
Do you want some food with that butter?
Please tell me I'm not the only one who got the Alton Brown reference
I love how you make baby carrot and green pea more of a sophisticated side dish as i often find them quite boring. Will def. Try it tonite
make swedish meatballs (pew style)
DO KHLAV KALASH
make candy apples
I’m starting to feel like I’m the only person that hates butter.
Disappointed to see the steak not encrusted by peppercorns :/
how dare you!... i mean seriously, the audacity... blue label not worth $200 a bottle? blue label is worth its weight in gold!!!
No Babby, he drinks GLENGOOLIE. By the name and logo this is GLENFIDDICH.  NOT SHITTY WALKER.
You should create “chum” from the chum bucket in spongebob!! Would be cool to see what you could  make outta it 😯
There was a bar buget... Annnnnd, its gone.
Steak au pauvre
Hi Babish, can you try making Vietnamese Bun Rieu Cua. Seen in Gordon Ramsay’s Escape and he claims it as the best dish he has ever eaten
An interesting video but coming from the UK,  I  find it uncomfortable watching an American holding a knife and fork.
If one were to use green beans instead of peas, would the seasonings you used still hold up, or would you suggest going with a different arrangement?
Hello, Humans.      “Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.” Forrest Gump, 1994
What about doing an MRE? Perhaps get Steve on and make a better vomlit. Or rather make the food weeks in advance and see how it holds up when you get it out on a tray. Nice
The thumb nail looks like samanalla alla mo
You should do the walnut pie from Brooklyn 99!!!
Do shrimp park from the goldburgs!!!! Bev’s famous shrimp parm that even Dave Kim thinks it’s good even though it’s seafood and cheese!!!
What kind of movie/tv show is this?
That’s not how you cook steak au poivre.
Babish can you please do an episode on your favourite alcohol, like your go to whiskeys and cocktails that you like
I was watching this on my bed and I accidently drooled on my bed when I saw it done
Hey bro. What's going on at BA? Saw ya there.
Yes
Are you dry curing those poor fillets or seasoning them babish? 😂
Can you do the “falafel hotdog with cinnamon and bacon on top” sandwich, the one Brick eats in anchorman?
Sounds like something good with mashed potatoes!
That's almost how I do carrots except instead of orange juice and Brown sugar I use maple syrup
Has anyone noticed his videos on YouTube have become significantly shorter? And I may be wrong, but I remember her post at least twice a week instead of just once
Diabetes
Where to find "meat mallet"?
I'm still baffled that people "let meat come up to room temperature for even cooking and juiciness." I forget who wrote a long article on it, maybe Kenji, but it's been proven that it doesn't make a difference whether the steaks are at 40 degrees (fridge-ish temp) or 65 degress (room-ish temp). Thought I'd pass it on, Babish!
Yeah im making this tonight
Mmmmm butter
I’m watching this while making pizza rolls in the microwave
What about Potatoes and molasses from Over the Garden wall?
Is there a cheaper brand of scotch that you would recommend if this is something I wanted to cook for myself or a date?  Don't mind dropping on good food, but I don't drink scotch enough to warrant $200.
You should make a restaurant call like movie eats or showtime eats
5:18, true but you can just buy Johnny Walker Red by the Liter, refill you’re $200 Blue Bottle, and no one will know the difference...

...and for those who can tell the difference, just serve a few rounds of Blue and then when the taste buds go numb and the inhibitions start to lower and impair their senses, switch to the refilled bottle 👍
Try to make the a Durr burger from fortnite
Babish, where is the You're the Worst episode that America deserves?
So is $200 Johnnie Walker actually good or do you have to pretend it is because it was $200?
My favorite dinner recipe of all time. Cooked it for my first serious girlfriend in college for Valentine's day (thanks Alton). Was a magnificent evening.
I'd like to see you do Clemenza's sauce from The Godfather.

Archer is a terrible person, but he's a terrific alcoholic, and would certainly know pairings.
Oh my god yes, I love archer it’s my favorite show ever
Based exclusively within the context of your channel, your diet is very synonymous to Shaggy.
Good Eats with Alton Brown is one of my favorite cooking shows.

Do cheese jerky from Hannah Montana
Never mind the steak, I just want those carrots.
Gasps Babish, you of all people should know to use the green peppercorns in brine, not black peppercorns, in a proper Steak au Poivre!! Unless this is specifically the Archer recipe. Xx

Babish, I love you, but it's not steak au poivre if you don't cook the steak with the peppercorns crusted on.
Babish, you forgot to not add peppercorns.
This looks like nursing home food... those carrots ewwwww.
Comrade Babby, I like to think that you are like more serious version of me when it come to cooking.
Look great as always.

Love the alton brown reference.
It makes me laugh every time you're frying something you make a noticable effort not to say "golden brown and delicious" just say it, man. AB won't mind.
Marco Pierre White’s recipe is much easier
Man you need a French language consultant. "au" is pronounced "O". Steak O pwah-vr-eh
Babi, you are a home wrecker - you gotta do more collabs with Brad to make up for it... please.
Did you channel Jennifer and Clarissa (Two Fat Ladies) for this episode? :D
Babish the type of guy that always lets the flavors to get to know each other.
I tried a chefstep Ready sauce and I hated it.
I was having a SUPER bad day but seeing you make food from one of my favorite shows made me feel alot better
Thank you Mr.Babish uvu
My favorite breakfast is butter waffles with plenty of butter and butter syrup and butter sausages covered in butter and gently sauteed in... wait for it...butter and then put some butter on it.

Never watched Archer before but this I can watch over and over again! Looks so delicious! Cheers~ 🥃 (blue label lol)
Steak "O" Poivre not Steak "Ah" Poivre my dude
I always assumed Glengoolie was Glenfiddich
Curious. what type of salt do you use? Edit: i should rephrase that, is the salt fine, coarse, I don't know the name for it, but how rough(?) is the salt?
Wym Archer's a great person
Steak looks over cooked and one side has more grey muscle than the other. Probably cooked it to medium and forgot it still cooks off hear
Wrong fork grip. Bad, bad form.
Steak au Poivre was one of the first things I learned in culinary school. That shit is so good.
something is odd about this vid :)
I totally noticed that he didn't saute the shallot before adding the peas
Get Gordon Ramsey to cook one of your recipes for you while you do the voice over

Please do the Turducken Slammer from Supernatural
Alton Brown should be everyone's culinary hero.
Best peas: sautéed in butter and a little malt or red wine vinegar. Salt and pep. No frills best mang
ah, best part about this show is pam has shagged damn near everyone
I think the Glengoolie Blue is actually Glenfiddich special edition (which has a blue label). The names and labels are much more alike.
Please. Kosher Salt merch. We need it. We require it
To be honest i stopped wanting to eat this after seeing the 1st butter stick
Looks more like butter with some side stuffs for me.
Make the cheese quesadilla and tapioca pudding cream brûlée from Kevin cooks things in the office
I wrote clean plate club accidentally when I was tryna write clean plate system 😂
That wasn’t a full lemon
Not a movie, but the food from Monster Hunter: World would be awesome. Especially because the little cutscene you get when you order food is sooooo cute! Its cats preparing food!
Theres three different dishes, tier 2 looks the best, and its a great reason to make a fish curry and a whole roast chicken.
no offense but if you wanted to be true to the show you would make it without the peppercorn
bob
why does the steak look like pork ?
So funny thing, I had watched this video before school today and I get to (culinary) school and I see that the demonstration for today is Pork Poivre, and I was really confused because it sounded familiar almost like I just heard about it, but I just couldnt pinpoint where I heard it, so the teacher is demonstrating this and I asked if you could do this Steak as well, and she said yes, and then it instantly clicked, Andrew did this and I saw it first then went to school and saw it happen again. It was really weird.
Studio ghibli food? or the food from coralline
Together breakfast from Steven Universe? :D
Cmon man! You can do better than E&J...it isn't even cognac!

4 shame Babish
Gordon Ramsey would be proud of you if he saw how much butter you used
I love that show and that steak so much you don’t even imagine
I love glazed carrots
Can you do grilled cheese ice cream from phineas and ferb?
I remember this one episode of Regular Show where they made a drink that was more like some kind of spicy food amalgamation called the Mississippi Queen. Think you can recreate it and make it better?
another certified banger
I just want to see pepperoni plates with Babish. We need a bottom topping.
Hope you get to some ofthe Food wars dishes. Would love to see you make the Tempura Egg.
I swear these should just be called, "What Babish is eating for dinner tonight"
Yes
What an absolute heart attack of a meal
We NEED everything from Burnt!
Babish, I love you man, but the way you pronounce "wh" fills me with murderous rage
ive bit my tongue for too long BABISH why you hold your fork like that ?!?
why is 'bright' a description of taste? Bright is a visual descriptor.

Do you go out and buy the ingredients for each video or its stuff you just have around?

Easy tip for steak pan sauce recipes: if any juices leak from the steaks while resting, throw those into the sauce.
Do Sea Salt Ice Cream and Tarter Aux Fruits and possibly another item from the bistro in Kingdom Hearts 3
You didn't use the reserved pepper powder in the sides! SHAAAAAAAAAAME.

Also lazy steak at poivre. Laaaaaazy. You are supposed to crust the steak with the pepper and pan sear it, finish the sauce once the steaks are done and removed with the peppercorns that fell off the steak, and return the steaks to the sauce  to coat. If you're gonna quote Alton, at least do it right, his way!


Also the recipe works great with pork chops or tenderloin.
Archer 😂🤣
You should do the food from The Office - Dwight's Christmas
Just a s*** ton? Why not a f*** ton?😂

Also Babish: use some fresh ground pepper from a grinder
Who watches for the actuall recipes? Not me
I was legit watching this episode last night! How did you know?
I demand mystery croquettes from kill la kill
No one's gonna talk about how he didn't season the steak with pepper?
Oooooh, I LOVE Steak au Poivre. It's soooooo freaking good. :-)
Your recipe looks awesome (I've read about a dozen different ones, and this one is a top-3 version), but I would have liked to see some whole pepper corns in the final sauce. That's a minor niggle, though.
I never met a person who said "those are some tender carrots"
how did no one notice the king of the hill reference 3:36
“Every wHich way”... boy love those H’s
They should just make an archer cookbook already.
I'm pretty sure the whiskey they're referencing is the glenfiddich 30 year, since the bottle looks exactly the same
"au" is pronounced "oh" not "ah"
when i make this i use canned green peppercorns aswell and it’s rly good, this is one of my favourite meals but with fries or bread to sop up the steak juice and peppercorn gravy
Can you make escargot In the peanut butter as mentioned in Mickey Mouse and the three musketeers Mickey Donald and Goofy.
That’s a lot of butter
Do you want some steak with that butter?
Been to the supermarket....... cannot find a sh*t tonne of butter..... please advise.
I don't know how you do it babish, but you made the two vegies I hate the most, look SOOOOOOO GOOD!!
Holy sweet boobies. Happy Valentine's Day and great good Karma for you.
WUH-ICH WAY.


Say Whip Cream for me please.
the sheer amount of butter in the episode confirms Archer takes place in the 60's
How to flavour and consume 2 sticks of butter in a single sitting.
Colossal props for Alton Brown reference; he's among my culinary heroes as well.
The butter use is me during this pregnancy 😂 I swear I go through a ridiculous amount of butter during the week if I don’t limit myself.
I was just listening to Louis Prima and Sam Butera You should do “Banna Spit for my Baby.” I know you get a lot of requests, but you should probably look into it. It might be impossible for you to do though.
What? No total count of butter used for this meal?
Idea that might just get passed up cause it might be dumb but it would be cool if you took Tasty recipes and tried making them yourself and then making your own version
To keep the butter from burning you can add a little bit of Olive Oil I had seen Gordon Ramsey do that before
I'm so glad that Good Eats: Reloaded is a thing
Please stop, my downstairs neighbour is sending a small army of plumbers to my home to find the source of the infiltration, not knowing it's all my drool...!

No greater lie exists in the english language than "too much butter"
Not enough butter....
Steak au Poivre Poivre Poivre
You should use Julie and Julia (the movie) as an excuse to make a ton of French cuisine! Great movie and he food looks awesome!
Isn’t Glengoolie a parody of Glenfiddich, not Johnnie Walker?
So, is kosher salt Babish’s lamb sauce?
Watching this eat cold Little Caesar’s pizza
Thanks for acknowledging Archer being an awful person. Loved the honeymoon episode
maybe do kevin’s chili from the office next !
Could also mean Glenfiddich 14, which comes in a blue box/label.  Better buy that as well for science.
Monk fish turducken from malcolm in the middle plz
When you said “Every which way”, were you channeling Woody Harrelson’s character(Carson Wells)  from No Country for Old Men?

Hmmmm....needs more butter
Best way to eat steak — and I am a vegetarian.
That was brandy Babish, not cognac.
Jonnie Walker Blue is damn good, but I feel like it should be a buck sixty at most. Damn good bottle of scotch though.
Any dish from the 100 foot journey !!!!!!
The way you hold cutlery gives me anxiety.

Meemaw’s brisket from young Sheldon
Only 200 that's a STEAL
Please do dumplings or noodle soup from kong fu panda!!
Archer = how men should be
Death Sandwich???
This is all the coolness. I thought, though, that part of steak au poivre involved coating the fillets in the cracked pepper before the sear, taking advantage of the fact that the pepper directly in contact with the pan won't burn due to lack of air flow.

And while Archer is flawed, he's not completely horrible. Certainly ranks ethically better than Rick Sanchez, that's for sure.
The sauce from good burger please
Oh baby that Johnny Walker, it comes into it's own when ur drunk off the blue alone, not so much in a single glass
Do something from the sopranos
4:28 tiny whisking
This might be a stupid question, but how do you keep the sides warm while coocking the beef? I always have problems with either my side dishes cooling down while I'm cooking the main part or the sides burning when I'm trying to keep them heated.
Aaaaaaaand yet another reason I love your channel. Any cook who doesn’t have Alton Brown as a culinary hero is no cook I ever want to follow.
Ah so it's butter with a side of beef and vegetables.
Hey Andrew, been subscribed since pretty much the beginning. Can you do like a fast food Chinese staples like General Tao Chicken, Kung Pow Chicken and Egg Rolls? Much love
This looks delicious,but this amount of butter would give me the artery disease :/
Shouldn't there be a peppercorn crust seared on to the steaks?
Archer and Alton Brown did an animated collaboration together, it's pretty awesome!
GLENGOOLIE....for the best of times 😎
You should try and tackle literally anything from Shokugeki (Food Wars)! Maybe the Karaage or something!
Heyy! Can you recreate some food from The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit?
You sound like Alton Brown’s son. Lol love the show
I can feel my arteries clogging up from all the butter which makes me wanna make this even more
I always thought Glengooly Blue was Glenmfiddich Select Cask cause it has a similar name and packaging.
You should do onion and banana juice from Avatar the Last Airbender.
Why did i never notice your voice sounds like Archer??? Are you and John H. secretly brothers?
I'm impressed babby made a healthy meal into a butter feast just for us
Could've used the pepper particulate instead of fresh pepper for the carrots but ok
You butter believe that you made a meal with mostly butter
Holy shitsnacks

Wait, you actually liked JW blue label?? Wow, that's surprising, honestly.. I'm more of a Glenfiddich or Few fan, myself.
bit of advice, Mint works better for Sugarsnap peas, not standard peas.
4:30 Ah I see you're a fan of Mario Batali as well.
Alton brown is a culunary hero to you me to good eats is my favorite Show by him
okay but why does babish sound just like archer ?

Olive oil symbolizes Gordon Ramsay while Kosher salt is for Babish.

Dear precious one, Jesus Christ is with you and for you. You face nothing alone --NOTHING! When you feel anxious, know that you are focusing on the visible world and leaving our Lord Jesus out of the picture. The remedy is simple: Fix your eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen. Verbalize your trust in Jesus, the Living One who sees you always. Make "I trust you Jesus!" your response for every single thing in your life. Your successes, your challenges and everything in between.                            

Trust in the fact that Jesus will get you safely through this day and all of your days. But you can only find Him in the present. Each day is a precious gift from God our Father and Creator, through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is rediculous to grasp for future gifts when today's is set before you! Recieve today's gift gratefully, unwrapping it tenderly and delving into its depths.         

Dear friend, receive Yeshua (Jesus Christ) as the Lord and Savior of your life this very moment! Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of a Savior. Believe in what Jesus did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. It will be the best decision you will ever make. ❤️❤️❤️   (Romans 8 : 31; 2 Corinthians 4 : 18; Genesis 16 : 13-14) (AMP)

i love the way you say sauce
Eggplant parmesan from Twins?
Don't underestimate the value of adding that pasta water. It really ties the sauce together (makes it creamier, and helps it stick to the pasta better).

Southern Italian deep fried polpette recipe:
 - Minced beef and pork, touch of garlic, flat leaf parsley, breadcrumbs, an egg, salt and pepper
 - Roll small polpette as shown in the video; do not bread
 - Deep fry to medium-done (you could do medium if you do beef only)
 - Eat the amount of a whole meal as an appetiser on Sunday lunch
 - Know that every Sunday at noon thousands of grandmas in Southern Italy will be frying meatballs because last time they saw their grandchildren they looked a tad skinny.
Babish do you run out of gas?
my mouth has fallen open and will not close for a few hours now that i know of the cheese taco shell
You should try making Bart’s Hot Chocolate Clown Party Marshmallow.
Mr. Babish, can you make a dish called Bish Lasaña from Pewdiepie vs T-Series?

Me, a gay: 😲
That's a whole new level of student life hacks!
I tried these years ago and they where amazing
On the one hand, this seems like a great recipe to make for children.

On the other hand, it's incredibly messy so children should not be anywhere near one of these.
Hell yeah boys my request is finally granted
I grew up on icarly. When i saw this. I rushed to the store

Can you make the dinner from The Road (film and novel). It’s Ham, green beans, mashed potatoes, and biscuits and gravy. Plus watered down whisky that is very old and canned peaches and cream over biscuits for dessert with a cup of coffee. Challenge: it’s all canned/non-perishable because this is a post-apocalyptic world. The film is on Netflix and has Viggo Morrison in it.
Binging with babish literally stole my friend's video and made it to trending with it... Wow. I'm shocked right now.
Please, fellow swedes... Confirm that the meatballs he's making aren't "tiny" by any means, and that they're above average in size compared to an actual meatball. I mean, the tennis ball sized disgrace of a meatball that Americans usually make is at least 7x the size of a real meatball. 

PS: As a Swedish person a do indeed have authority in this. Good night.
Hot
Wow Babish has totally skyrocketed in subs since 2017! Keep up the great content!

Heeheeee
Somebody toucha my spaghet

Somehow the world will change for me
And be so wonderful

I know somehow we're gonna get there
And feel so wonderful

I will make you change your mind
These things happen all the time
And it's all real
I'm telling you just how I feel

So wake up the members of my nation, it's your time to be
There's no chance unless you take one and the time to see
The brighter side of every situation, some things are meant to be
So give me your best and leave the rest to me

I know it's time
To raise the hand that draws the line
And be so wonderful

Golden sunshine
I know somehow it's gonna be mine
And feel so wonderful

Show me what you can become
There's a dream in everyone
And it's all real
I'm telling you just how I feel

So wake…

About god damn time
The nostalgia
As I my head lay on the softer edge of my memory foam pillow, my eyes began to shutter as Sam and Carly's voices started to fade. As my eyes almost fully shut, and my sense of hearing began to fade i drifted off to the soothing sound of Sam saying stomach acid.
Hate chunky pasta sauce
I have a request that’s likely to get buried but uh....tuna sandwich from Fast and Furious that “no one likes.”

Such clean editing, crisp audio with good music choice, gorgeous HD footage, smooth transitions and narration, delicious food with easy-to-follow recipes, concise sponsor placement and content that satisfies the geek in me.

I’m so happy I found this goldmine of a channel. Subscribed for sure.

So someone is always watching?
I'm not watching the Super Bowl for the game or the teams
Chicken wing lollipops? :o
Now I can have those and regular lollipops at the same time ❤u❤
Parties and ur house must be the best😂 (bc of the food)
Though SimpliSafe is very helpful, nothing is more terrifying than someone running at you with a créeme brûlée torch.
Try some old fairy tale things, id like to see how well the giants bread would come out. "Ill grind your bones to make my bread".
I personally go for a murder hole and hot oil for my own security system, but I see why other people would use something else.
Candied bacon gave me Epic Meal Time flashbacks. Good times.
Nice video as always ;)
Could you re-cook the mighty Meat Plate from the video game Monster Hunter World? It would be nice to see your version of it. :)
Candied Bacon

Or, as they are well known, dog treats for human beings.
Could you do a Basics with Babish for Meat Substitutes? I do okay but it’s hard sometimes to figure out how to replace stuff like Bacon Fat.
SimpliSafe: Because Tiny Whisk must be protected at all costs!
Will you make Conchas 🙏🏽 (Mexican sweet bread)

Seriously though - you do awesome work, Andrew.  Thanks for your hard work!
Kingdom hearts: Sea Salt Ice cream please
I've learned the bacon tastes better with blitzed walnuts on top. Oh yeah yeah
Better chicken wings:
toss wings in corn starch
fry for 8 min, let them cool for 15 min,  fry again for 4 min,
they will stay crisp for hours
OMG I'm 37 and have never heard of or seen let alone tasted CANDIED BACON.
I was about to go to bed but there's no way I'll be able to sleep now gaaaah!

I don't watch sports! I'm better than you because I don't watch sports! Sports are dumb, and if you watch them you're dumb too. Hahaha! 

Why don't people like me?
Thank you for not being creative and making the sauce correctly.
That intro always makes me feel nostalgic, even though I don't cook.
c'mon there must be a REAL Parks and Rec Special: Meat-Tornado, Calzone, The Swanson.. Buda Buda Budaaaaa
I think whatever monstrosity you made with those chicken wings is morally wrong.
SUPER BOWL.

Hold up Buffalo Sauce is just hot sauce and butter?
You should mix the maple syrup with BSB

Also, I'm definitely interested in that home security device.
"Candied Bacon or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the cholesterol" best line I've heard in a while
Babish, you're my favorite YouTuber and I love you, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you tell me how to cook/eat chicken wings....

I’m sure EMT will be very proud of the candy bacon technology
I work at a TV station, and we're not allowed to 'say Super Bowl,' we have to say 'Big Game' for like copyright issues (?) I see Babish has been told the same thing. 😂
That bacon looks good for a Superbowl Party
No security system will keep me from stealing those churros.  Get your back up pans ready lolll 😂
The production on this show is amazing!!
Can you do a marathon of chowder recipes
Mmm! Tastes like Sweet Victory...
please, please do something from miyazaki's films!
Shout out to Epic Meal Time for making Candied Bacon a thing everyone does now.
Just saying, but I hate buffalo sauce. I like my sauces more like sweet and sour, and not the potency of vinegar that stings your eyes.
"(...) or how I learned to stop worrying and love the cholesterol."

"If you're really worried about the calories, you can always serve this with a nice, light arugula salad with shaved fennel as a sick, sick joke"

Can you make me buffalo chicken dip?
How about something from Tim and Eric
I’m just imagining Babby waking up in the middle of night holding a kitch torch like a gun, in his pjs squinting real hard at noises. 🤣🤣🤣
Frank's has their own buffalo sauce. Are you saying to just add butter to their original for a better wing flavor instead!?
something was off about this video.. maybe it's since im not a fan of the new intro or the overly loud background music. speaking of the intro, personally i think its a bit too flashy and mainstream for a chilldown channel like BwB
Made the churros :) Absolutely fantastic! Definitely making them again
Ahhh... adding these recipes to my cookbook.





I'm pretty sure I'm going to die young
"We're going to try our hands at hot wing lolipops" how about no.
addition to the bacon: quarter the strips and wrap them in lil smokies and addition to the maple and brown sugar add cayenne pepper, so good it should be a sin
Just slightly less dirty while earing but more while cooking
Well, I’m glad I didn’t make these delicious snacks for THIS years Super Bowl...

fleshlight sponsorships, I see you're moving up in the world
That home security pack is just overpriced toys that do less than a professionally installed system
can someone explain why they like buffalo sauce? its sooooo sour i cant.
You should totally do a Scrubs special where you'd do JD's classic Appletini
Simply safe is usa only!!!
The background audio-had to stop watching because it was too obnoxious.
If your chickens aren't already easy and clean to eat, you're not cooking them to a high enough temperature for them to tenderize all the way. Treat them like pulled pork and take it to 190-195 internal temp.
If u dropped the wings in the grease w/ ur hand, why not take them out w/ur hand ?  🤷‍♂️
Loved the episode. Makes me want a carnival food episode
When I saw “big game” I thought you meant actual buffalo and not buffalo wings
I thought the superbowl was around Thanksgiving.
Could you make Aunt Lucy's Marmalade Sandwich from Paddington 2?
So whos just watching the superbowl for the Avengers Endgame trailer?
@4:38 does Binging with Babish Juul?!
Everything looks delicious, but when one eats wings, a mess is par for the course.
I thought this was going to be a video about making snacks with big game meats. Like bear and buffalo lol
360p gang
The intro snare sounds wierd, it has that wierd ecko lol :D
Epic meal time needs to collab with you.
You can't cook in here ,THIS IS THE KITCHEN!!!
Immediate like after tossing and saucesing line.
You’ve got to have chocolate sauce with churros, dude.
You should make the swedish meatballs made from the king of youtube himself. Maybe improve it?
Hey BABISH......what kind of watch is that ?!
Can you do an Episode for Pasties and Sausage Rolls from the UK? I'm sure you'd love a nice Cornish Pastie and do something creative with it.
Kingdom hearts 3 is next right???
I don't get the hype around the Super bowl
Can you make the clemenza pasta from godfather
I'm just glad that this year there won't be an emotionally crippling episode of This Is Us right after the game.
man but the messy wings are the best part
babish could you please make the Sunlight Souffle' from the uncommon taste cookbook from skyrim
Could you do a video on macaroons I’m struggling to make them :(
Making those wings tonight 🤤
Man, you really are shilling hard these days. Why can other creators get by with the youtube income alone ?
Your voice is so satisfying.
I'm not making any of these for the big game, but i'm glad i watched your video. It was entertaining as always!!
NFL fan therapy will have something to say to you about too much sauce God knows the Buffalo Bills fan is just pounding that stuff
watching this as you shit is chaotic good energy
A security system??? Dude.....😩
Hey BWB, can you make Happy Birthday himself's cake head from Regular Show episode, Happy Birthday Contest?
Babish, you should make Jacksfilms' protein shake!
You don't make friends with salad BwB
Bonus points for the Doctor Strangelove reference!
NFL will likely sue you for that reference
Hello 360p my old friend, I've come to talk with you again...
Make the sandvich from tf2
Do Mississippi Queen regular show
Grays on being 10th on trending -dr guy
I got heartburn watching this
I made an apple brown betty for the game
Those chicken wing lollipops ain't it, Babish
Solid Kubrick reference.
We are on track by the end of the quarter
Omg his wooden spoon has a beard, brilliant
My favorite part of the game~
Shouldn't you double fty the wings?
Patriots🇺🇸
Or 
Rams🐏
So when are we going to get a "Tiny Whisk" T-shirt and/or hat?
With Kingdom Hearts 3 out now, could you attempt Sea Salt Ice Cream from Kingdom Hearts?
I saw the title and thought he would be working with big game....like elk, buffalo, etc. Just a little disappointed
Probably the end of the Big Wing.
3:07 I want to try one of those Bacon's, great idea
As a buffalo native, thank you for using franks
Obligatory oh yeah yeah
I would kill for that bacon.
I can smell that candied bacon through my screen and it smells divine.
If you put cyanne with the bacon, makes it so good.
SHNACKKKKKKS
i was about to say where ur yard at u live in Brooklyn lol
I’d just...eat chips.
"You can always serve this (candied bacon) with a nice, light arugula salad with shaved fennel as a sick, sick joke".  Made me laugh out loud.  Nothing like a deadpan delivered joke!
I love your sense of humor!😄😄😄😄 all the way to the sign in your pretend yard!
Great vid as always but it looks like a fleshlight!  Allegedly of course.
You only tasted the buffalo sauce once for Rochester, you forgot to taste twice for Buffalo
WE NEED A BASICS WITH BABISH ON STROMBOLI!!!!
I thought you were going to make super bowl snacks out of big game animals lol
2:17 so we’re not gonna just ignore him saying “Hwipping” instead of “whipping” like stewie😂
Episode 34 in the video...but it says that it is episode 19 in season 2
All of the youtubers I watch have the exact same sponsors. Probably not a coincidence, but interesting nonetheless
I thought the churros in the thumbnail were cheese straws.
Just make the wings normally who cares ur with ur friends
Adding cayenne pepper to the candied bacon 🤤🤤🤤🤤
Please make Sea Salt Ice Cream from Kingdom Hearts
who else will watch football with no socks?
4:30 food aside is that TINY WHISK!!
Please do not display a sign if you have a security system. It will deter the novices but likely be giving a road map of what to do for more experienced burglars. By all means get the system; just don't put the sign up.
My churro dough came out looking like water. What did I do wrong...? 🤔
Isn't it -14 C in new York.
Sorry Babish you forgot the deflated balls I thought you would know better smh
they really are pure evil
Babby, I love u bud, but I'm from Buffalo, NY. I'm watching this during a blizzard. And I can't approve ur mutilation of those wings. Some things are meant to be messy!! Go Bills!!!!!
Me in the Kitchen:
Hmm... I got the recipe, Lets make some chicken winged lollipops..
“And speaking of..” lol lovin’ it babish
Raw chicken looks so nasty 🐔
Previous level bacon flips, just saying
Babish I have committed a sin...




I seasoned a burger before forming the patty
Do the rubber glove sandwich from the electric company
“Toss with our sauce” watched that part 5 times
Hope these snacks are useful for UEFA Champions League and Europa League’s final in May.
My grandpa made chilli for his party
NO BABISH your killing me! All that prep on the wings just to deep fry them!? Marinate and bake!
Could you please make something from the Adams family movie or even the show would be great, pretty please with cherries on top?
I saw big game snacks and thought we were cooking moose and bison.
Cool
Chili’s, T.G.I. Friday’s, and Applebee’s should serve your buffalo wing pops at their restaurants
make burger, HERETIC BURGER
The beat was too good or Im cheeched cause i missed everything he said on the first watch
That lowkey Dr strange love reference though.
What team is everyone rooting for on Sunday?
🏈 🏟
Bacon strips and bacon strips and bacon strips.....AH DEEP FRIED!
I think you shouldn’t make the wing sauce that way. It’s very easy for that sauce to separate. The best way is to bring your hot sauce to a boil and then turn it off and start to mix cold butter into the sauce. It won’t break and the consistency is exactly what you want.
I wonder who's gonna make it to the superbowl
Loved the Dr. Strangelove reference
Babish these look pretty tasty but why is this a Basics episode? Nothing was really learned here. I feel like you started strong with the first few Basics episodes in terms of actually teaching people how to make different kinds of food with various skills and some imagination, and now you're just showing really simple recipes. Like if you had made a Basics episode specifically about chicken wings, that would be one thing. "Chicken wings are really customizable, we're gonna make these three sauces to show you what flavors go good with chicken and then you can use what you've learned both about making sauces and about flavors that work with chicken to make your own chicken wings recipes." But instead this is like "Okay mix some hot sauce and butter together and then put it on chicken wings there you go." I enjoyed the show but I disagree with the direction you've taken Basics in.
My mom makes Candied Bacon but also puts on some cayenne pepper to add just a bit of spice
#4 on Trending! Congrats!
Make any of the following derby Scones, Admiral’s Pie, Ruby Tea, Beef stroganoff, Raspberry jam from the salad fingers series in honor of the 11th episode release!
Quick tip: if you can find in your local supermarket, churros are best served with Dulce de Leche (or as we call it here in Brasil, Doce de Leite!)
First
>BIG game snack

yet some of you feel this game isn't big enough for yourself right....
Shout out to tiny whisk!!!
Really good intro 👍🏼
Ooo it's so fancy now. Just a suggestion to turn the background music down a bit. May just be me but it's a little loud/hard to hear you.
First
trending congrats!!!!!
OMG that 🥓 🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🤤🤤🤤🤤
Chicken wing lollipops AKA Frenched chicken wings lol
We made that bacon and omg it’s amazing
You should do Ed's sauce from good burger
I think it's actually disrespectful that not even a single Epic Meal Time reference with that bacon
I'd like to see a Tony Paco's (from M*A*S*H) episode. It's an actual place, but you could still Babish it-up.
do the cheese sandwich from fyre festival next!!!!!!!!!
@Babish check out chicken lollipop from India
I love that Dr. Strangelove Reference
Will Andrew answer this comment?
"there is no such thing as too much sauce" careful you can get lost in the sauce
Next time try making the churros with olive oil, is how they're made here in Spain. They have so much more flavour.
Gonna need that lunch from the Aviator with the brook trout
I'm stealing that mini churro recipe 😄
candied is the ONLY way I will eat bacon!
That's a lot of sugar honey ;)
More pastries plz! Baking with Babish 😩✌️
Who else is watching on Super Bowl🏟 Sunday??
As a Louisianian I am only watching for the ads.
I love your videos but I do think that the watch and the music is very distracting in this video. Just some constructive thoughts
Extra points for the Strangelove reference!
Do chilli fries from Ben 10.pls pls pls...
CHURROS SHOULD BE EATEN WITH DOCE DE LEITE/CHOCOLATE
What should I use if I don't have any maple syrup for the candied bacon?
It's tiny whisks lesser known brother, Medium whisk.
I am in love with his voice!!😍
okay I FULLY thought babie meant big game snacks as in like bear and elk. Like I was expecting venison bites or some shit haha
Please do the sea salt ice cream from kingdom hearts!
These snacks look "BOMBA"!!!
I love food all 276 lbs of me, but maple i's the worst flavor in the world. Thinking about it made me want to vomit.
As a Spaniard, I have never ever tried a churro that included anything other than flour and water in the dough.
Yeah!!!! Wire rack!!
I don’t know how I feel about anything but bourbon in a julep cup.
Expected a video about cooking big game, instead watched a video about cooking smaller livestock.
I shouldn't of watched this right after the video about a fox news host not washing his hands
Who needs SimpliSafe when you have a gun?
OMG IT'S BINGING BABISH'S TWIN BROTHER BASICS plot twist founD

This episode made my heart hurt.
Love the intro!
Love the Dr Strangelove reference at 2:27
Bruh I'm gaining calories by just looking at it
Who do you want to win?
Comment for rams 
Like for Patriots
Am I the only one hearing the music cut off at the intro?
2:08 but one must not get lost in the sauce
Try double deep frying the wings for crispy skin even after saucing!
Dammit Babish my work cook off was today. I would have slain with these dishes
One of the countless amazing details about this channel is that Andrew always presents his sponsors with a healthy sense of self-irony.
i thought this video was about like hunted game meat snacks
everyone knows the best part of the chicken wing is the knuckle cartilage
That's'a whole meal right there. Looks soooo good
I miss Super Bowl.
With the wings why don't you just have the wings out then have sauce bowls out that people could just dip into??? Kinda like chips and dip but with wings.
Make some food from Laid Back Camp!
Why did you have to spoil the main point of the Game?
You can get lost in the sauce, brudah
How are you doing with the cold?
Commenting until Babish does Tonio Trussardi's food from Jojo #2
If it ain't broke don't fix it
Big game snacks? So like,,, bison and elk?
1:56 "Before we toss with our sauce." Love the cheap comedy.
When you live in the uk 😂😂😂
Could u make the fruit salad from the wiggles, and maybe use the trap version of the song
Please make more iasip foods 😩
i normally get why sponsors pick certain youtubers, but i...don't get how this sponsor found babby
i enjoy his level of ocdness its uncannyyy
Toss with the sauce 👌🏼
Thought you were gonna be making elephant snacks or somthing...
Two pieces of bacon per guest? I admire your optimism.
And where did this cool wooden spoon came from?
I'm a simple man. I see the tiny whisk in a Babish video, I smash that like button as much as possible. ;)
Binging with Babish: Alliteration Edition
that new intro is fire!
You made Churro's from scratch but not Dulce De Leche?? Lazy!!!!!
you and Sean Evans were in my dream last night :p
Ever heard of getting lost in the sauce
Okay I messed up 😂
for people watching sports, or for stoners midnight snack
please please make the "oreo french fry pizza" and the "peanut butter and gumball pizza" from the movie Mr. Deeds
I am making a steak with a compound butter for my parents and siblings for the Super Bowl. Thank you for inspiring to cook and pursue my passion
Who else would love to see a master chef season with youtube chefs as the contestants.
So no seasoning on the chicken made my heart stop
not gonna lie, thought babish was flexing 4 airpods in the beginning
TAUSS WITH AR SAUSS
1:56
...you didn't make a comment about having the different pieces of the security system get a chance to 'get to know each other'

Thumbs down. Shame on you
Lollipop chicken wing is chicken wing without soul...
I've never watched this show with headphones on and the shiver that passed through me when he spoke for the first time was better than any asmr video
candied bacon will always remind me of Epic Meal Time
We wanted sweet victory but all we got was cheapy mccheapskate
I couldn't eat that bacon.  Well, I could but I wouldn't really enjoy it.  Aside from, like, teriyaki chicken I do not like sweet flavored meats.  They just don't do it for me.
How have you not made meatloaf?
hey just asking, can the churro dough be left overnight for convenience sake? or will it compromise the tastiness
Why not just normal chicken wings?
i gained 5 pounds just watching this
10/10 ad Segway
1st one cringeeee
Sooo Babish idk if anyone has told you this, but Franks makes a Buffalo sauce, which happens to just be Franks Red Hot plus butter.
Not at all worried about home security, but cheers on a good video
4:36 what the duck happened to the lighting?
OMG! I honestly thought he meant 'Big Game' as in Elk, Bear, and other typical game animals!
You had me at candied bacon!  Mmmm!
SimpliSafe is awesome security. It’s really effective, it’s really easy to use, and the price is great.
4:39 i see your juul babish you aint slick
Not as smooth of a segway as Linus
Do The cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover PLEEEEASE,  i supose it could take some time but it will be worth it
Bacon in a cup is one of your favorites?
Man, you should top your churros with doce de leite.
That is some FATTY bacon, and I thought he meant like elk and bear recipes lol
this title is click bate. I thought you meant big game as in bear or deer or moose
Dude you’re from WNY. You aren’t allowed to say “Buffalo Wings”, you’re supposed to just call them “wings”
Have you ever considered participating in master chef or any other cooking competition?
Video starts at 0:23
Oh you live in my city hello neighbor
I just need one thing from Gilmore Girls
Babish bringing back that epicmealtime candy bacon vibes
I love binging with babish..till actually try to make this fail and remember why I'm bad at life
I thought you were gonna make snacks out of deer or moose
*Bingeing with Babish, not Binging. Binge(ing) - Eat or drink too excess.    Bing(ing) - Microsoft's search engine.
Come on babish you gotta add more cinnamon, churros deserve more than just sugar and a pinch of cinnamon!! Lol
Please use some ethics with your ads. the internet of things(/shit) is a gigantic source of security breaches, both digital and in real life. do not use "smart" devices to secure things, buy a better lock.
We usex to make candied bacon at Girl Scout Camp when we had cookout breakfasts.  We'd get visits from other counselors those mornings.
How about next the möbius chicken strip from Dipers guides to the unexplained
"Big Game"...I thought we were going to eating some large African game from a recent Hunting Safari...then I realised you assumed the rest of the world watched American football...
You can get lost in the sauce if you got too much sause
Have you ever used bing with someone watching and thought "they're BINGing with Babish?"
want to protect your home? Just use guns! Works everytime!
You should do some of the dishes Tonio Turssardi made for Josuke and Okuyasu from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable. Or the squid ink pasta Joseph ate in Part 2, though I'm not sure how easy squid ink for the dish is to get.
Let’s set the record! 😂👍🥜
Ayyyee a doctor strangelove reference. Nice
Now all I can picture is Andrew chasing crooks out of his apartment while dual wielding creme brulee torches!
I wonder if dipping the wings would be blasphemy or nah?
I had to do chicken lollipops in my buttering culinary class and it sucked!!!
It would be cool to see you do a kingdom heats special showing food from the new game and old ones, interesting to see some sea salt ice cream and all Haha
Be careful Babish, don’t t get lost in the sauce
2:37 CANADA WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
Only OGs remember Andrew Rea
The joints are the best part
Aw, the Dale Carnegie reference!
Do Ron Swanson food please (there's a vid on YT titled "eating with Ron Swanson")
Babs I love your channel but plz don’t mutilate chicken wings like that♥️
i love this channel so much
Everyone’s in the hot tub 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Candied bacon. It sounds vile.
For SimplySafe to make you feel safe in main streets of NY... i trust it
studio ghibli please!
What are you doing to those wings?!
Will he ever not be the most charming person ever?
I just realized why I hate advertising so much. This isn't three minutes of entertainment with an unfortunate sales pitch tacked on.
This is three minutes of entertainment designed to entice me and make me feel obliged to listen to the sales pitch.
Babish is just a salesman with an elaborate game, and now I know why a career in Hollywood has never seemed glamorous to me.

Alas, this also explains why truly great films and music are so rare these days. True artists often fail to succeed, while the successful people are really just sleazy salesman. The best case scenario for us is a truly talented artists being taken advantage of by greedy suits in order to profit from their hard work and passion and...
The world is a much sadder place than I had realized. Truly, these are dark times.
I don't watch sports, but thanks!
Do the simple rick's cookies from rick and morty
Im so hungry, havrnt tried the others but the candied bacon can legally kill me ushshjsj
Who wants the Patriots to win
Get them coins sis!
Do the full course from Tonio Trussadi from JJBA
Please do Naruto Ramen
You should do fried stuff with cheese from friends
I must have watched every video posted twice but this is the first time Ive noticed his hands being hairless? Is this a thing in the culinary world? should I be requesting my more hirsute fam fam that they should be trimming down their hand fuzz if they're big cooks, or does hand hair not fall out the way head hair does?
Heat your sauce and add cold butter in a sauce pain. It's better that way but I don't know why just trust me.
I’m not messing with my drumsticks, thank you very much.
I wouldfeel way less saafe with a robot constantly monitoring me in my home
My dad is a huge Rams fan, as well as a snack fiend. May show him the chicken lollipops
Your voice is asmr
lol something tells me you're not in the mean part of NY
TOSS WITH OUR SAUCE!!!
Well, time to go die, thanks Babbi.
That spoon omg
Anyone traveling to Atlanta for the Super Bowl:

Watch out for the prostitutes, they either have STDs or they’re actually a ma.... never mind.

We don’t pronounce the second T in Atlanta.

Never trust anyone who offers you free parking

Don’t move here, take yo ass back to whatever bum dum city you came from cuz we full 😂

Yes we know our train system sucks 

Be prepared for the most bipolar weather ever!

Coke over Pepsi. Always.
Don't do that to wings smh 😔😔😔💔💔💔
Anyone else disappointed that he isn't cooking Bear or wild buffalo? That's what I think of when I see big game.
That Strangelove reference lmao
Stop making me so hungry
Hey guys, Babish With Basics here, and today I’m going to be cooking, artery cloggers.




And the best part is, they are very good for us.
Thanks, always a pleasure to watch your content. How long until you tackle the big one? Chianti, Fava Beans and Brain?
Can you make something from Kingdom Hearts? Like the tart from Kingdom Hearts 3 or something like that?
Too muck work ! XD
You should have an episode of the show where you invite Adam Conover to your place but he just makes fun of your show while you cook him a pizza.
I always knew you were a film fan babby
I wish the police restricting food thievery. Especially during the big game.
Now, we're talking!!
I'm making taquitos al pastor with pina
I'm going to comment on every video from here onto the future until I can get one of those bearded wooden spoons
Could you do an episode on sushi?
No batter for the hotwings?
Bowser - Bowsette
Drum - Drumette
Try the impossible burger!
غتششءشبل
TWO strips of bacon per person?..... haha
You should make a juicy Lucy, pretty much a burger with cheese in the middle of the patty
You should do cornbread from the green mile
too much sauce and you can get lost in the sauce
My vegetarian ass is not welcome here
i protect my home with an angry dog and a 12 ga but nothing will protect that bacon
I was expecting snacks made from big game. I am extremely disappointed.
Basically 30 kg each snack
BIG GAME TONY
Another great episode, but I think this may be the second time I've seen you do Buffalo sauce and it's not a complete recipe. Kudos for using Frank's Red Hot, but then with the butter there needs to be some vinegar, some cayenne, some garlic powder, and a little bit of Worcestershire sauce, and then simmer it for a little bit.  I'll never go back after making it this way.
"We're calling the police if necessary." Which border are the police gonna show up to?
I'm such a dork, I assumed u meant video game snacks from big popular games right now
This was not what I had in mind when I read "big game."
Ads that can't be adblocked. Feelsbadman
That new intro though
Make meatturduckballiza from the thundermans
I thought it was gonna be like elk and bear "big game"😂
New background music, finally! No offensive, Babish, but your old music was drivin' me nuts.
Thought you were gonna make snacks from big game, like boar or deer. Disappointed.
Love this music
I’d love to see how you’d interpret the Lemon Pepper Wet wings from Atlanta
I always use peppered bacon from the butcher for candied bacon. The flavor combo of the brown sugar and black pepper is amazing.
I need that bacon 🥓
Good keto game snack - Guacamole with a teaspoon of black caviar and some blueberries...high in healthy fat, fiber and omega 3's.
You made all that in a minute
Ah yes. Famous sportsball
The product placement in Babish videos is getting ridiculous!
you wont need simplisafe in the new(ish) kitchen if you dont say your address while youre live streaming :)
Nice Dr. Strangelove reference
gimme gimme
The salad joke was gold
There is such a thing as too much sauce.
Tooosss whit the soosss.....😂😂😂
That's a lot of Cholesterol
Or the Missipi queen
HE SAID SUS!!!!
I'm my own security system
Hey Babish, KH3 came out and it includes plenty of food items made by our favorite little chef, and deserts! Think you’re up to it?
Go for master Chef
there's a quicker way  to do the wings. Hold them with a clean cloth to stop them slipping in your hand , starting with the drum in the palm of your hand   bend the joint backwards until it snaps and pops off from the cartlige. then push the clean bone through the skin using the ball of your palm (/thumb) .  next do the same to the flat/ tip joint  pushing back enough to expose both the bones of the flat, now take the smaller of the 2 bones and twist it  until it slips free. separate the 3 sections of the wing as normal. it takes a little bit to get the technique down but it's worth it if you're doin a ton of wings ( i do 3kg at work everyday)
oh I thought this was gonna be snacks made out of big game lol
Make your own version of Taco Bell’s Naked Chicken Chalupa
screw the patriots. go chieeeeffffssss
I love the bearded spoon
Wtf is " the big game." It is called the super bowl.
I think your spatula needs a shave
Welcome to the beard dude likes hearing himself talk channel, oh and food too I guess
I just noticed the spoon.
This music is so heckin groovy
Damn. #6 on trending
E x t r a t h i c c
I'm realizing that if Babish is willing to spend all day deep-frying in his kitchen and then cleaning up the resulting mess, he loves his friends more than I love mine. 😂
2 minutes of ads on a 6 minute video. Nice.
At first i thought the churro transition was a mexican - wall reference , then i realised it was a brand placement segue
Vital addition to candied bacon: grainy brown mustard. Gives a nice tang and spice, while complementing the sweetness and saltiness very nicely.
Those chicken lollipops are the type of thing I'd make once to impress people, then never make ever again since it seems like a lot of effort for a minor payoff or to look flashy.
Epic meal time
Did anyone see that his wooden spoon looked like him or some kind of merch his about to release?
Make eggplant burger from the Scooby-Doo movie

Bippity bappity babish
Love the Strangelove reference.
AMADEUS PLEASE
Lol protection with a frying pan and a knife
A little bit of cayenne on the bacon and it makes it even better...
I would love these while rewatching game of thrones
I understand why the "Lollipop" version of wings really appeals to some. Great at a party where the hour d'vours are passed around on a little plate. But this is the BIG GAME. I say buy some moist towelettes, leave more meat on the bone (and more surface area for sauce!), and save prep time.
Making these snacks for the game has mini whisks
Babish, what's with the sneaky sepia at @4:35
This is so... American 😂
Oh yeah yeah
when saucing the wings, its better to not stir the butter and hot sauce, then add the chicken straight from the oil...then toss...
Make the Hobbit feast.
The lollipop wings seem unnecessary
Does anyone have the reference number for the rolex?
uhhh, those chicken "wings" look so unappetizing. No thanks.
Now do big game snack, as in wild game snack
I made churro cakes today.
how are the chicken wings less messy if the bones are still covered in sauce?
Don’t get lost in the sauce
looks good
I pulled my meat watching this but it was a mess...
wow you r on trending
Gotta love dem big ole' churros down in San Antonio. Do y'know that victoria is a secret down there?
"half a stick of butter" isnt a measurement and please use celcius too, at least some note on the screen.
Nice video 👍👍
DIABETES INTENSIFIES
Where do I get your wooden spoon??
Got to much sauce!
I like your Kubrick ref
I would love to learn how to make gnocchi or alfredo sauce
The fact that the music uses The Lick as a major part of the melody is incredibly distracting.
The candied bacon. WHOA
My wife once made candied bacon, but she chopped them up and put them in an egg breakfast burrito.
I saw that meat pun in the captions with the wingettes 😑😑
It's been a while. Good to see the awesome content is still here
It’s not a bwb video without him dissecting a chicken cadaver, popping joints and all
These snacks were better than the game itself.
Vegetarian/vegan episode?
the churros look easy to make said me a few hours ago
been watching for a few years now, always loved your stuff. thanks for being so quality with all your videos.
Bread Part 2 please
I gained weight just looking at that Bacon
i love you
I heard "Big Gay Snacks"
You made a little mistake. You said that the drumette was a lot more easy to eat wing!
Hello, Humans.  
Laura: You had a nightmare.
Logan: Do you have nightmares?
Laura: Si. People hurt me.
Logan: Mine are different.
Laura: Por que?
Logan: I hurt people.
Laura: [holds up the adamantium bullet] Que es esto?
Logan: You know what it is. It's made out of adamantium. That's what they put inside of us. That's why it can kill us. Probably what's killing me now. That was a long time ago. I kept it as a reminder of what I am. Now I keep it to, uh... actually I, uh... I was thinking of shooting myself with it. Like Charles said.
Laura: I've hurt people too.
Logan: You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.
Laura: They were bad people.
Logan: All the same...

TERRANCE OUT
Is that a Doctor Strangelove reference at 2:26?!?

This channel has grown so much that it no longer has to free-ride off of famous names on the titles...

And even bought brand new commercial stove... wow.. 

Money to throw around. 

It must be good to be seen favourably by youtube.
I wanna see him on chopped
This channel helps sooooo muuuuch
Make bacon in a box
One of the best satisfaction in life is eating candy bacon for the first time in your life.
I have a new love for buffalo sauce
A less conventional alternative to the wingettes: chicken lollipops. They're an old favorite in Indian Chinese cuisine.
That's my dream meal right there in 5:49 : D
For some reason when the title said “big game” I thought this video was going to be about making snacks out of bears and elk.
for me, no list of big game snacks is complete without a spice meaty cheesy dip for tortilla chips (the kind they use to market velveeta)
Yo that really looks like two cups of flour for the curros
Love that watch, what is it?
I'll be honest, I miss the Ratatat
in America u fry your wings?
4:45 harRY pOtER
Your a dissapointment to buffalo
Love ya Babish, but I can't support a sponsorship like SimpliSafe, or as I call it: Install Your Own Wiretap de Jour.
Lollipoping the chicken? Is this a super bowl feast or a dinner party for snobs?
I won’t stay for the games, I stay for the churros
do you know how to boil water?
taste for tastiness
1:31 he flipped us off...
Yo, I made those churros today. I need to adjust the recipe to fit my personal tastes, but as a base they are solid. Thanks!
“lollipop chicken” is a food at many ‘indian style chinese’ restaurants and a major nostalgia note for me lmao
Babish can you teach us how to make chocolate covered fruit for Valentine's day
But... all buffalo wings can be eaten one handed.
Make chocolate oranges from the carbonara effect
This screams America
Hey I made the candied bacon but add a bit of cayenne and it it gave it a great kick
Babish would you please please please make the chocolate pie from the help (obviously without the extras)
Nah the bacon your doing it wrong you have to do it the boogie2988 style
How can anyone live in New York?
Have you considered making the Mississippi queen from regular show? Or maybe death sandwiches? it would be amazing if you would do some of the foods from that show
Jokes on point this episode
I tried making the churros so i went to your website for the recipe. nowhere did it say i had to boil the water mixture first, so i ended up with a very wet dough. might want to have clearer instructions. i had to add like twice as much flour and it just didnt turn out that great ;-/
And here i am Protecting my house with a gun don’t i feel stupid
just make boneless
Anyone else click on this think it would be different ways to cook big game. (The Animal kind)
Please do food from How I Met Your Mother!! Like Erickson’s 7-Layer Salad, the Minnesota Tidal Wave aka the Robin Scherbatsky, and Sumbitches!!!!!
You’re killing me
Dr Strangelove??
Probably the first time i actually wanted to buy something in an ad
simplisafe is over priced crap
I've never just thrown chicken wings into oil with no seasoning or even breading... I'm hurr
Make the pie that hit president merkin
Tbh, just cut off the chicken meat, so much better
When can we expect Babish to be on Hot Ones?
When i read big game snacks i was expecting a basics episode on how to break down and cook an elephant you just shot
Jesus man
Im not a big sports fan, but i love big game nights just because the food
مش ده بلح الشام
What are you doing with the blow torch  at about 3:40?
The other hand is for drinking beer.   ? Wtf is with this guy
You are in desperate need of a new theme song.
nice Dr. Strangelove reference
3:16 looks insane but I think 3 of these would give me diabetes lul
Does he season his chicken?
I honestly want to see you team up Gordan Ramsey one day.
Not being American, I was worried 'big game snacks' would be made out of elephant or something
I would suggest when cutting the churo with scissors have a glass or bowl of luke warm water handy to dip the scissors in for a clean cut
Cool w H ip...

This video is 22 on trending at the time me viewing

Cheering, jeering, or beering, Babish!
need to know how how to make artichoke dip
I’m vegan and I don’t like football but I’m still happy to show up for Babish.
You are an amazing cook. However, that’s not how you eat wings.
Omg yum! Yes!😍😊💕
Big gae snacks
Looks like Wright’s bacon

Those are regular sized churros and the giant filled monstrosities you get at the mall are just inauthentic hipster versions.

I was hoping that these were snacks made out of big game meats such as elephants, wyverns and leviathans.
sport  🏈
I'll eat the whole counter.
An addition that I love for candied bacon is crushed red pepper. Adds a nice kick. Also, Simply using Frank's seems too easy for babish but I'll let it pass.
Can you do the dish from the a-team reboot? The curry tapenade with toasty points
Black pepper on top of the maple syrup, under the brown sugar 🥓🔥🍯
4:36 why did the shot become less saturated?
Hey B, you know what makes ME feels safe? My right to bear arms, my AR15. Sadly you live in NewYork, where they dont recognize the 2nd ammendment.
Babish does it again
Guava jam is my favorite churros sauce
Broodwich
Great video
You probably had a good reason (lots of sponsor-money) displaying some very unreasonable gadgets for a channel who is to 99% into cooking, which doesn't match at all.
I am kinda disappointed, Babish.
go pats!
You never even seasoned the chicken!!!!
mgaah
Throw some red pepper flakes on that bacon. You will thank me.
Pro tip for added deliciousness: replace the brown sugar on the candied bacon with maple sugar
Churros without dulce de leche? Booooooo!

You need to add a touch of cayenne pepper to the maple syrup. The barest hint of heat goes a long way for candied bacon.

Babish, where do I get that wooden spoon?
the churros and bacon are lethal
When is the BWB merch store coming online? I'm a woodworker, but I'll still buy a spoon with your beard on it lol.
I tried to make eggs Benedict and the eggs were ehh kinda rubbery but the hollandaise sauce cooked as soon as I put it on heat and got clumpy and smelled like cat food for some reason 0/10 waste of eggs
Woo they call this chicken Tulip in Japan.
You frenched them wings Babish and you know it.
Bacon 🧡
Member when babish used to hide his face?
Good eats
I like that watch
Damn
Yo Babish, you should make some of the pizzas from Mr. Bean’s “Pizza Bean” skit, where he burns and ruins different pizzas and you gotta try to make a pizza with fish sticks and orange peels appetizing.
You'd think after so many years of American shows, American bacon would not look weird anymore... Buy it still does 😂
Ugh. It's not a copyright violation to say "Super Bowl Snacks", any more than it's a copyright violation to make a video of "Iconic food item from iconic TV show". It's a lie propagated by the NFL, which is a non profit.

Nice color grading at 4:35
1:26 Most satisfying thing I’ve seen all day.
You don’t get it’s fun to eat chicken wings because theyre so messy is
How about a video on Marinades, rubs and brines?
Hey guys
Candy for men. Or really manly women
Binging with Babish I’m sorry but please don’t tell me you use a liquid measuring cup for the flower.
GO PATS
Go pats
The one day women die the most is Superbowl Sunday, with Christmas as a close second. Ladies, please remove/protect yourselves. Gentlemen, violence over a televised sport is beyond necessary, and abuse is inexcusable.
Wings are messy because of the sauce. Lets make lollipops and then coat them in sauce so they are equally as messy to eat.
Make the beese churger
get a gun
That’s dumb.  That’s the tastiest part of the wing.   Plus good luck with that cooking method if you have more than 3 people coming over.  Bake the wings till they’re almost or just done then cool them off and you can do this the night before. Fry them before serving and the skin comes out crunchier that way.
Please sir, may I have more Bedtime With Babish? Its been nearly a year since I've slept. Please sir, just a morsel.
I’m not convinced with the “chicken wing lollipops”. Part of the appeal of the chicken wings is the it gets all over your hands. Tbh, I think you’re messing with a classic in a way that you don’t have to and that many people won’t like.
cayenne pepper added to the pig candy is sooooooo bomb
That wooden spoon have Babish etched onto it?
Where is the watch from?
Legitness
Ew that buffalo sauce sounds terrible. Please us cayenne peppers not Frank's hot sauce!
Rochester cried franks red hot tears watching you french those chicken wings, Babish.
Hey I might be a little off subject. But I stumbled upon a really good burger recipe. Soft bake pretzel for a bun sliced in two. buttered then toasted. A nice smash burger salt and pepper coarse. Asiago and baby swiss. Chili garlic oil with a little honey Dijon. I could say Caramelized onions but my mouth watered so bad i stopped being fancy..

I don’t get why people add too Much work with cooking like if you make a painting too realistic is it even considered art or a picture I think the whole “ and I added the tuned lobster too the struck pig fat with extra baby teeth” like that’s too much for stuff that keeps us from dying like we don’t add recipes too air
who said the hs word?????? high school musical!!! i’m the one who said it ooo😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟🍕
Wow the comment section is a damn wasteland
Any one else think it meant Large animal you hunted by big game
If you want a little kick for the candied bacon, grind some black pepper on each side as well. I think it adds a lot to it.
Lol
If it’s food it’s good
Why the filter change at 4:35?
Chicken wings should be eaten on the bone.
Do the fish sticks and custard from Doctor Who!!!! Also, although usually a given, I love this video! Any excuse to make churros :')
gotta add some black pepper on the candied bacon. adds a subtle kick.
How about remaking the gumbo from princess and the frog?
That candied bacon should be illegal
Can I just hire this guy?
Hey what watch is that ? Make an edc video please, or like a kitchen edc lol
Sorry but the world cup is in three years
Babish, I love your vids but why do you try so hard to sound so smart. So many of your viewers just want you to talk to them like they’re In front of you, and not as if they are in a lecture about how to properly cook food. I mean if this is how you normally talk and you aren’t putting on a facade then I get it but it’s more enjoyable if you just talk how you normally talk
that’s a toothbrush cup.

Mean streets of New York? Are those skinny as a waif Brooklyn hipsters causing you trouble?
The spoon. Everyone shut up this about the wooden spoon.
Don’t you mean the big commercial snacks?
I personally loved candied bacon. The only extra stuff I include is cayenne, black pepper, and a bit of honey as well.
WAT IS PART explain plz no hate
You tried this but was a tool and didn’t put enough sugar on my bacon. I never thought I’d be worried about that
For the bacon, real maple syrup or the American sugary stuff?
Babish's wings
Oh yeah nahui
I suddenly get why Americans are all so fat. God bless America
Was that a Juul at 4:38? lol
Let’s be honest, nobody actually cares about the Super Bowl anymore. I’m just here for the food.
About the churros, let the dough ball cool first before adding the eggs or the eggs could cook. Don’t make the mistake I did.  also, that candied bacon was great.
If you don't want to use scissors and a piping bag for the churros, try tying a piece of string tight across the middle of the pot between the handles. As you squeeze out the pastry, just drag across the tight string to cut it. It also works for certain types of gnocchi dough
But Rugby is the men's game.
I thought "Big Game" meant stuff like venison and bear ;(
What happened to the seasoning on the wings????
NYC hasn't had "mean streets" since Bubba Gump Shrimp Co 'trumped' edible panties from a peep show as late night snack options in Times Square.
Candied bacon wrapped churros. This seems like a wasted opportunity :)
Can we please have the life of churros soon
Bruuh
Make some candied jalepenos
the laziest babish yet
Thinking of a candy land X chutes and ladders combo where the chutes are candied bacon and the ladders are made out of mini churros
Should have added black pepper to that bacon *kisses finger tips
What’s the deal with that bacon?! It’s about 90% fat!
Lol I thought by “big game” you meant like larger animals
It’s 4 am.. I have school in 2 hours.. and I’m watching this and I’m craving anything babish can cook
SimplieSafe is being hacked all over the place. Just google it.
Is it wrong that only now Ik where binging wig babyish song comes from
Why are Americans so fat... oh wait nm, I get it
I am going to hack your simply safe system and steal your fridge.
Babish! I am sorry but please something that fits the hungarian kitchen.
Ew he didn’t cut off the fatty skin on those chicken wings and they seemed so bland
Babish, you ruined wings
What is the big game ?
By skipping eating all this once a year, I justify basically living off of junk food for the rest of it.
hi.  at 3:47 you are aiming what looks like a heat gun at the pot while the burner is on.  can you explain?  what am i missing.
That bacon would be too sweet     not how bacon is supposed to be made
No Velveeta Rotel Cheeseburger Dip, or Grape Jelly and BBQ Cocktail Weiners?
Whhhhhipping.....
So much sugarrr....😢😢😢
Im not a salty basement dweller but this has to be the worst Binging with Babish video. Half the video was an ad, the food could have been so much better with almost no more extra thought and its so far off of what this channel used to be. Just bummed.
Misleading title. These game snacks look small.
come on now, no one is making any of this tomorrow. be more practical. don’t have to act so high society 24/7 bab
Odd question what do you usually do with frying oil after youre done with it?
I would make the pizza balls
Do an eye reveal
Like the advertisement method in this video. Straight and to the point
So i know this is so stupid and simple but im curious about the salami and eggs from big mouth.
intro theme sucks and is annoying
GO PATD
You should make "some kind of grey food" from Eric Andre Show
make potatoes and molasses from over the garden wall
Big game snacks, but no deer, bear, antelope, moose, or bison?

ooh the OTHER big game.
I want to know did anyone actually try this during the big game? If so how did it turn out?
Why is there bacon . They got lazy eh
1:40, everybody in the pool. I don't care if you can swim, you just gotta get in!  Wrong video...  my bad.
Cool video
Kiss a baby.
real churros are made only with water, flour and salt. i don't get why americans do them like that but that ain't it chief
Churros
I feel like such an idiot, I’ve seen this video three times in my YouTube watchlist for Babish and all this time I thought that “big game” meant elk or wild boar or something, not WATCHING a big game. Sigh.
Ive made the bacon before, we call it “millionaires bacon” and its unironicly one of the best damn things on this planet
Why would you use a cup of sugar to coat 12 small churros
Hey man, Love the show, ever consider cooking something that wont give you a Heart Attack?!
Can you try to cook some of the joke recipe from the Borderlands Facebook page?
Love seeing a sponsorship that's NOT a meal kit delivery service!
Oh no! Why would you do that to the wing's wingettes? Putting your finger through the middle to get the final bit of meat is the best.

Also, Louisiana hot sauce all the way.
Also you can buy wing stop or make mexican food...
My girlfriend broke up with me two days ago, the reference to Dr. Strange love is the first thing that has made me laugh since.
+1 for Dr. strangelove reference
Perfect timing for the 6 nations. Is it intentional?
¡Those churros are only allowed with hot chocolate! And thats heaven for you. (I would also recommend to make then longer).
That Dr Strangelove reference there did not go unappreciated
2:07 Guccimane says otherwise
How did it take this long for me to notice that beautiful wooden spoon? 3:53
super bowl
The BBQ place I go to has homemade candied bacon... SOMETIMES! I asked the owner/pitmaster "why only sometimes?" he said "I don't know, that's just how we do it." The man's a meat genius so I didn't push him.
Candied Bacon!?!? Are you try to kill me Babish hahaha
Deathkwando sandwitch?
for a basics episode how about tools for beginners and some basic knife skills?
sellout
wingette?
What he said: "let's get down to basics"
What I heard: 🎶 "let's get down to business!" 🎶
The music was mixed pretty loud, it was kinda hard to hear you at parts
i really do love the intro track you use Mr Babish!
Candy bacon... It's like Epic Meal Time in 2019... That was a thing...
It's better to label those ingredients during the making process.
Make the Mississippi Queen from Regular Show please
4:30 Hi Tiny Whisk! ^.^
love this!! can you make silver linings playbook game day crabby snacks and homemades?
Hot ones with Babish confirmed?
Buffalo sauce is just a hot sauce now that's disappointing
Sweet Jesus, I think I'm having a heart burn from just watching this video
Yo I have one of those security systems. Good stuff.
The churros look good but the others look revolting
Candy bacon, the prime example of what American cuisine is about. Make of that what you will.
This was surprisingly very comedic
“If you’re worried about the calories”

Yes because me, a calorie conscious lad, decides that candied bacon is a healthy food to make.
When are you going onto masterchef?
Haven’t heard a dr Strangelove reference in 84 years
Yo, it's Frankensteinteen, time to go make them chicken lolipops, become the monster and eat'em in one bite
BOYCOTT THE SUPER BOWL
Those wings seem super hipster
As a fan of Epic Meal Time candy bacon was already in the recipe folder of my brain XD
Good Lord what heresy, what would your family in Rochester say? the mess is part of the wing-eating experience.
Buffalo sauce needs some garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne powder.
You can double fry your wings (such as two 5 minute fries with a couple minutes rest in between ) to make sure they stay crispy after the sauce!
man, now i understand why my candied bacon always go wrong
i have been using Molasses instead of mapple and brown sugar
from the winglets, you remove the  Ulna.... the small bone , we also have that bone , I´m an  archaeologist and biology is my master :) I also love cooking and you´re one of my "guides" cheers mate
hey babish I would like to hear your opinion on traditional ovens compared to induction ovens. is there a difference in flavor or any kind of process to when it comes to cooking or do things tend to tastes the same?
"There is no such thing as too much sauce" -words to live by
Ooooh big game snacks as in super bowl,  you should do a Big Game snacks like Elk bologna, and bear meat balls
Why didn’t you double fry the wings?
wingettes? Babish, you mean flats
i made that candie bacon in my cooking class but we wraped it on a mini sasuages and they were the best!!
Andrew what about the baking powder method for the chicken wing?
Could you do a scooby doo special - sccoby snacks + 5 ft tall sandwiches
Oh yeah yeah
Please do a basics on tofu
4:35 what's wrong with this shot?
I was hoping this would be about large wild animals
He’s gotta be gay nothing wrong with if anything is think it’d be cool if he came out
Chicken wing lollipops have to be the most stupidest thing ever
4:35 what's with the sudden Christopher Nolan color grading?
Quick question, should I toss the churros in the cinnamon sugar while they're still hot or wait until they've cooled?
Give me Champions League anyday.
im allergic to cinnamon, do you have any good alternatives?
I'd love to see him fend off against two burglars with a creme brulee torch.
4:39 JUUL
For the Buffalo sauce, brown the butter a little for an extra boost of awesome.
Cause it's sweeeeet sweet victory!
You're losing my interest and respect with all these ads...
My home security is done by a company called ArmaLite.
1:56 Babish's inner russian soul escaped for a second there
Just to be the "you must be fun at parties"-guy: don't put a sign in front of your house telling everyone through street view what exploits they have to bring to your home to get in. Cooking and entertainment were impeckable as always :)
what the hell is this filter 4:35
Nunca suelo ver comentarios en español por aquí, donde están los hispanohablantes?
BOYCOTT THE SUPERBOWL!!!! WHO DAT FOREVER!!!!!!!!
Mmmmmm, churros with ketchup
Please tell me you're going to start selling kitchen utensils with your logo on them like the one at 3:50
my dad makes that bacon for christmas!! he uses super thick cut bacon and adds some spice to it. i can’t even eat a whole slice of it it’s so rich hahaha
I know this is "basics" with Babish but that buffalo sauce is pathetic and you should apologize for misleading the fine folks who watch you.
What’s wrong with the framerate
“How I learned to stop worrying and love the cholesterol” this guy is just my favorite. Great use of a great movie 😂
honestly you should do the Special Order from Ratatouille
wings i will never make because thats too much effort
Wow that wooden spoon with your beard is hysterical!
I add cayenne pepper sprinkled on top of the candied bacon for an awesome kick!
Nah, I would rather keep my cookies safe than anything else xD
Can you make food from fantastic mr Fox
Could you please do a video of the foods in Alice in wonderland
Gonna pass on the super bowl, tired of seeing the patriots
Oh yeah yeah
Do be careful guys; too much bacon can cause more than heart problems.
nice Dr. Strangelove reference
How do I get a babish wooden spoon?
Churros needs dulce de leche man... what a waste
Man! I wanna make those churros tomorrow!
Sorry Babish, but the joy of eating wings is found in the messy hands u get eating them
You eat unhealthy food for the unhealtyness, peolpe whom make unhealthy food healthy doesn't get the point of unhealthy food.
Food to watch the superb owl
big game snacks but you will feel like shit afterwards unless you eat at least ten vegetables

Make Jims dog biscuit cake from Friday Night Dinner
Well, I gained 10 lbs just watching that 


I have no regrets
Forgot to like do I came back to like it. Keep up the awesome videos!!
I love your work but as a huge fan of hot sauce I am completely thumbs down with that ghastly buttered down store brand mix. I would love to see you make a good hot sauce...maybe you already have I just haven't seen it yet.
Uggggg I’m on a diet and I see this, at least I can eat the chicken. Keep up the great work man, you inspired me to put more effort into the shit that I do (and my cooking).
Does anyone else get reminded of "Ridin' Solo" whenever they hear the intro theme for this series?
I would love an episode on homemade hot sauces.  There are so many different kinds you can make!
Wait, what happened with the color  at 4:35?  Everything goes sad for two seconds.
I vote that more Citizen Kane references are made.
Hey maybe something from rick and Mortey a pickle or ricks order at the dinner
I'll let you slide your meat down my bone.
Make some polish food it would be awesome
i'm full already
Okay you’re awesome and everything, but don’t disrespect those wings like that
Epic
Did anyone else notice the music?
4:36 what’s up with the color there Babby?
He didn't  want that  their daughter did  any  work.
Candied bacon? I swear to god you Americans have no limits
Mmm
How are you dealing with the government shutdown ? Are you okay man ?
Something all cooks and Rap Artist can agree on. "There can never be too much sauce." - Babish 2019
I can confirm that this man's food is 'big game' worthy - I made ribs and wings based on Andrew's recipes last year for the World Cup Quarter Final. They were so good that my friends and family almost didn't care that England lost to the Croatians.
"Easier to eat chicken wings" what in the hell Babby?
You didnt season yer chicken
I really need to stop watching your videos on an empty stomach ....
You forgot to make baby carrots on a stick, with a side of ranch sauce.
I was hoping for the other type of big game
What in the frick frack is a wing lollipop?
Why didn't you fry yourself because you are a snack 😉
Love that spoon
This guy is the BTec Quang Tran
Who the hell finds eating wings difficult? Part of the fun is tearing them apart and biting off the delicious crunchy ends of the wings
I like to candy my bacon with honey whiskey and a lil bit of maple syrup
Can you make Candied Hot-Dogs from 'The Misadventures of Flapjack'
Babish, you messed up on the wing lollipops. Jacques Pépin has a much better method of accomplishing this in his "How to debone a chicken", it's available on YouTube!
So one year I threw a big game party (I'm into the socialization, not the game) and I made those  chicken pops but it was sweet and spicy BBQ. I also made the candy bacon, mini pigs in a blanket, cream cheese and salsa dip, queso dip, spinach artichoke dip, meatballs, parmesan crisps, with a fuck ton of potato and corn chips and soda. The first wave of guests arrived and ate EVERYTHING so the people that showed up late had nothing to eat. I felt so bad, we ended up ordering a bunch of pizzas.
This is basically how I make my bacon for every sunday's breakfast.  not flipping so often, but baked in the oven with a sprinkling of brown sugar
Any tips for baking the wings instead of frying? I’ve tried recipes where you bake as is, or coat with flour or baking powder, but there’s always a few that end up with too much powder and are disgustingly bitter.
I don't get the social pressure to think chicken wings are "amazing".  Skin, bone, and gristle smothered in hot sauce?  Why society? Why have you hitched your wagon to this garbage that "big chicken" has marketed as the end all be all snack food for sporting events?
Candied bacon?  I'm getting some major flashbacks to Epic Meal Time.
I'm in love with the background music you used! Really kept the vibe really "chill" during the whole video. Keep up the amazing work babish!
"Make 2 bacon strips per person"... so like, you tryin' to start fights?
Or buy a BULLMASTIVE
Like dog treats for human beings
juul spotted 4:37
Love the Dr. Strangelove joke
Candied bacon? Just look at any Epic Meal Time video.
You should really consider opening up a restaurant and making these foods from tv we’ve all wanted to try
Two pieces of bacon per person? What kind of sick joke is this?!
If there's no dip, I dip
Uma delicia!
expected moose nuggets tbf
But can it beat Totinos Pizza Rolls? The only ones that can keep my hungry guys satisfied for the big game.
Anyone else see the colour change at 4:34?
Babish daddy can I eat you up like a snack? 😘
Did he miss color grading at 4:35 ?
Notigang
I hate everything about the NFL, but the fact that it’s illegal to say “su***bo**” takes the cake.
This should be censored in America because of carbs
Babish.
You've got your face on a wooden spoon.
You have truly accomplished life goals I never knew existed.
everyone else- I love these Smart home security devices!
IT workers, comp sci grads- I only use mechanical systems because of the deep terror I have of these products
Kingdom hearts 3 special incoming. I can feel it.
Face your fears Babish!
You can also try Gougeres. A savory French pastry made from choux dough.
To be honest, Cast iron pan and blow torch is a pretty good combo for self defence.
The salad joke made me crack up nice and good. Because of timezone differences it's the middle of the night. You woke my family up is what I'm saying, Andrew
babish your head really shines with the light and good job on the snacks ma favourit was chicken wings yummy
That Dr Strangelove reference was hilarious
Mmmm, Those Churros with chopped Candied Bacon, :) great Video as usual!
2:29 I see you have been watching Dr. Strangelove recently... Or how I learned to stop worrying and embrace the bomb
Candy bacon? What is this epic meal time?
4:35 I think you forgot to add color grading
i would love to be your this guys neighbor, the amount of smells would either wake me up to a great day, or make me look at my depressing dinner while smelling his amazing kitchen wonders
don't get lost in the sauce
Patriots or rams
Yo babish tell me what you did with the bacon fat son
PATS PATS PATS PATS PATS PATS
what watch are you wearing babish?
Food from American Psycho
Song anyone?
i love this channel, but is there anyway you could do more vegan/vegetarian recipes? even for stuff like this?
My favorite parts of the super bowl: food, ads, puppy bowl
Well that’s a heart attack waiting to happen.


Look delicious though.
Pro Tip - if you don't use clarified butter for the buffalo sauce, better make sure you keep the buffalo sauce / wings warm. No one likes coagulated wings.
Personally, Wings always taste better when you coat them in the sauce and let them cook in the oven for about 5 minutes. It also helps dry up the sauce making them even less messy
Ok Too much sauce.....I want these wings on The Hot Ones....along with BwB
Just think, Binging with Babish making the wings for Hot Ones with very hot hot hot sauce... He can make the wings like he wants but the saucing is done by someone else (Gordan maybe or even Brad from BA)
Hey Babish, can you make Buttercream Torte from Penny Dreadful?
Big game snacks??? Really babish???? Smh. U can do better.
Make stew from nacho libre or chese smoothie from zeek and luther
Taking cheat day to a whole new level
Odd short scene of sepia toned Babish tossing churros in sugar...
Big snaq
What big game are you referring to? Hmm...
Very disappointed this wasn’t Buffalo and other large game snacks.
He didn’t say shaggy dough.
We make various flavors of wings (our most recent being Chef John's RAM wings) for dinner from time to time, but my 7-year-old is one of those weird kids who absolutely hates eating messy things. The chicken lollipop might end up being the perfect solution. I'll have to try it and see, but thanks for the idea!
No Totino's pizza rolls?
I'd love for some super-millionaire with a conscience to set up a legal defense fund for people who use the S-B words so we can stop using the stupid euphemism "Big Game"
Make that chocolate cakes or any chocolate desserts that Selena Gomez bites into from Wizards of Waverly Place when she goes crazy for chocolate!
3:00 the best way to get heart disease and diabetes
You could put it on the roof.  The yard that people in New York pretend to have.  You might die of exposure at the moment though.
I’ve been making wing sauce like that for years, I just like to add a little bit of minced garlic as well.
I prefer Hickory smoke chicken stirp's, boneless parmesan chicken and bacon with a side of fries
and that's not for football, that's for me to feel good on a bad day
Mini whisk must be protected at all cost damn it!
Haha that's super impressive but anything involving meat products and the word "lollipop" is a bit too much for me lmao
I got a black garlic Carolina reaper sauce for my wings I hate football but love game foods in moderation.
I would've like to see you get more creative with the wing sauce.
That Dr. Strangelove reference tough
Tauws with our sauwce got me
Time to get blasted on grain alcohol.
Goooo, Superbowl commercials!
The big game being the six Nations right?
yeah im just ordering a pizza again
Needs moar grease....
Go Pats!
I’m making those churros! And millionaire Bacon FTW! Use pork belly for thicker slices
I wanna see Babish on Master Chef so bad
America the land of diabetes
Banish should attempt to create some of the foods from Tolkien’s “The Lord of The Rings”. Huge fan of Tolkien’s works. Perhaps boil, mash, or stick some potatoes in a stew? Maybe try to create Lembas bread?
Does anyone else just not get the hype of the superbowl? I just am not interested at all. Like its just football and ads... no hate just wondering if anyone else  relates.
Please do JoJo's Bizarre Adventures black spaghetti⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⬅To Be Continued
I love you, thank you. How about the cheese sandwich from Fyre Festival?
Okay but when are you uploading more “Bedtime with Babish” ?
Coating wings in corn or potato starch makes them even crisper.
cant wait to see sweet victory in the super bowl
I appreciate the Dr. Strangelove reference
Hey Babby, re-create something from "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover"
LET'S GET DOWN TO BASICS, TO MAKE STANDARD FOOOOOOOD
Love the new intro. Very professional
2:08 “there’s no such thing as too much sauce”... I’m sure Future would disagree
i dont like the shakey new camera perspective
Dont do that with my wings
hey babish! new but very big fan-- quick question: at 3:59 should we wait for the dough to cool down before adding the eggs or is it cool to add them just after creating the dough ball? thanks!
I recommend adding a bit of black pepper and cayenne to the brown sugar when you're doing candied bacon. It's phenomenal. Thanks Babish!
bro aint you from america ? get a gun
Off to the kitchen to cook some bacon sticks, right after I message my doctor...
groans churros moans
enjoy your heart attack and diabetes
Wow
Chicken wings messy?  Eat them with nitrile exam gloves, problem solved.  Oh sure, the waiter will look at you funny when you’re at Buffalo Wild Wings... but after you’re done, just peel the gloves and off and you can drive home without covering the inside of your car with delicious buffalo sauce.
Tbh im goint to be disappointed if SimpliSafe isn't able to keep all the boys away from my milkshakes in the yard.
Attach a piece of butcher twine over the kettle to cut the churros.
It's way easier that way
Monk fish turducken from malcolm in the middle plz
Please do a Drop Dead Fred episode with a mud-pie (real and chocolate) and a romantic salad lol
everytime babish introduces a sponsor its always well thought out and transitions smoothly with the rest of the video...thanks for the small things like this that make this channel amazing
it’s crazy how I found you when you were so small, now look at you with millions of subs 😭
seemed like a pretty low effort video
"Tired of protecting your home with cast-iron skillets, microplanes, and creme-brulee torches..." I don't know, sounds like a pretty effective warning to me, Mr. Lecter.
2:39
That looks like a hella lot more fat than it does bacon
Just me?
I seriously doubt there's anything more american than candied bacon
The food this guy makes kills me cause it Is so good looking but j cant try any of it this man is basically torturing us with this food
Please do beer battered or tempura battered onion rings!!!!!!!!!!
is that a juul at 4:38? just asking for a friend
So who's rooting for the Pats?
5:18 or buy a gun
Damnit now i want chicken wings.
These are great ideas! Someday I would really love to see you capitalize on football fervor by making the very dubious-sounding 'crabby snacks and homemades' from Silver Linings Playbook. I've always wanted to see this weird regional snack thing actually made, and it would be great for some superbowl content for you.
The music running in the background is very annoying
I don't really care about football, but I do want to see if they play "Sweet Victory" at half time.
Can I still make these even if I don't like sports?
Lol, 3:00 is the hardest I've laughed in the years I've been subbed.  I love jokes delivered with no expectation of laughter.
Candied bacon is pretty good, but mix some bourbon with that syrup and you've got a snack for the ages.
The Dr. Strangelove reference was quality.
Hay babish could you  trying revise something  to  pelo /glutin free ?
The other hand obviously is for the beer. Amateur!
Anyone watching this for the start of season 2 of the Overwatch League?
More excited for game snacks and the ads than the actual game tbh
Tell you what I've never seen a video become better with an ad in it but the humor and the flawless transition was so nice
Andrew, next time try par-frying the wings first at low temperature.  Let em rest a bit then back in at high heat for a minute or 2.   The par frying breaks down the collagen in the skin and you end up with something nice and crispy that doesn't get soggy in the sauce
The only reason I "watch" the superbowl is for the food, I technically don't even watch the superbowl, it's just background noise to my chewing.
Yo love that Pepin tech!
Babish is so talented 🤩🤩
never been so early
I like the Dr Strangelove pun
those wings look delightful
What happened at 4:35? Did you go back in time?
Wow I caught a recent babish video without knowing
"No such thing as too much sauce", clearly you haven't met me.
Can you try learning how to make sushi? An episode with you trying it would be great!
702 I winnnn
based on the title I thought you were going to be making Rhino nuggets or pickled Moose feet
That is one Superb Owl snack plate you have there
Apparently, my man Andrew hasn't played Watch Dogs..
I don't cook but I love watching your videos.
Ahh so tasty😭💘
Only thing I'm not too thrilled about in this video is the buffalo sauce, but it was wonderfully done. ♡
That candied bacon looks E-Vil. I can't wait to try it...
Babish is my favourite snacc
Now I wanna see you actually holding a frying pan and a torch defending your home XD
I'm black, and what you just did to those wings were foul. 💀
great video, but honestly if i was a burglar i would be more scared of a dude with a torch coming after me then an alarm system.
Can I beat my meat while eating wings
Phew. I thought it was about blue apron again.
I wonder how much damage babish could do with a blowtorch and an intruder
I'm not into sports, but this is a munchie meal if I ever saw one
I paused the episode to go make candied bacon
I wonder why Americans are obese?
pretty disgusting pretty disgusting
How about some Brazilian dishes that showed up in the Ducktales ep "The Town Where Everyone Was Nice"? Deep fried cassava, moqueca baiana, pastél... :3
>has 2nd amendment
>chooses meme security system to keep himself safe

SAD! many such cases!
Boss: you can have a 5 min break 
Me: watches binging with babish 🥰
5:20 
Buy a gun? 
Your a yank. Your lucky enough to not live in Orwell's nightmare.
I’ve got this image of Andrew chasing an intruder with a Creme brûlée torch in my head and it’s amazing
Never ever considered frenched chicken wings. They look beautiful.
Super wat? Football World Championship is not this year ;)
cold lamb sandwich from joe black
When are you gonna start selling merch?! I want that wooden spoon!
toaus with our soause
when he said big game i thought he meant like hunting game.
Only i get addicted to this channel?
You should try injecting “Dulce de Leche” into the churros, it is a classic argentinean beach treat.
Video ends at 4:50
I like the doctor strange love reference!!!
Hi babish can you do the creamy cheesecake from friends
I don’t think babble watches very much football lol
I've had the SimpliSafe system for a couple of years now. Just a few months after getting it, it totally saved us from getting broke into. As soon as the alarm went off the burglar just left. We were at a loud bar and I didn't hear my phone ringing so I missed the SimpliSafe call, so they escalated to the police who showed up very quickly and found my back door standing open. I did get the call from the officer who was standing in my house when he called. We met him there and verified nothing was missing. There was $6000 in cash in a kitchen drawer, we had just sold my wife's old car the day before and hadn't made it by the bank. Among many other things they could have taken. Totally worth it and it is indeed easy to set up and use.
A wall can stop the Mexican immigrants but can it stop Babbish's churro bites? I THINK NOT.
Hey Babish i know you probably wont see this but whats a good gluten free alternative to the flour in the churro's and how much should i use
Churros without Mexican chocolate or dulce de leche? That's weird.
This is how I make "Pig Candy" (the candied bacon) but one thing you may want to try is add roughly-cracked black pepper between the maple syrup and the brown sugar. It adds a lovely level of pepperyness to the overall experience and is really memorable!
@BGfilms Isn't buffalo chicken sauce a 1:1 ratio butter to franks, not a 2:1?
“Stop worrying and love the cholesterol.” -Babish
Nice now I can impress my friends thanks babish
why is the video quality stopped at 360p
I think I might make these for the super bowl. They look amazing
i lived three hours away from new york city and visited there but i wanted to know what its like to live there
I think I got a few pounds while watching this
Ohhhh big game as in the Super Bowl I thought you were gonna kill a tiger and cook it or something.
Do foods from Jimmy Neutron and Fairly Odd Parents.
4:35 Forgot to season that shot with some colors there chief.
2:28 Love the Dr.Strangelove reference
Love the Dr.Strangelove reference.
At 4:40 for a second I thought he was making a joke about trumps wall cause churros are mexican and was the most taken aback I've ever been in my life 😂
Can you do a basics on icing, your the only way I can show someone how to cook certain things and I need to show her royal icing
Churros will be forever safe!
Now lets make some instant noodles because i can't make these .
I'm a little curious with the chicken wings, in an earlier episode (The lemon pepper, Atlanta one) you showed a method for baking with baking soda, instead of frying, resulting in crispier wings. Is there a reason you didn't repeat this for the chicken wings here? Do you find there's a downside to using the baking method?
Can you please post vegan recipes? I get questions looking at the raw animals. Much respect tho
Needs way more cinnamon. Also pre-ground cinnamon? Really? ☠️
Franks and butter like a true Rochester man
very good all together but, the wings? if it ain't broke don't fix it...that is all.
thank you
Damn, that segway was so clean it would make TierZoo proud
Could you please please please do more recipes from Hannibal?
It's my absolute favourite show, and there's some really amazing looking foods.
Nothing to do with cannibalism... I swear...
Since Kingdom Hearts 3 dropped this week, do sea salt ice cream!!!
Man, you lost 20% of the wing...
Thanks for the Dr. Strangelove reference
I brine, then smoke my wings now. They're the nicest.
>shingling >no overlap >do you know how shingles work?
My boy forgot to color correct at 4:36
Urgh, that background music annoying and way too high in the mix.
1:56 that didn't sound like babish
Or just buy a gun
Why don't I come over?
Ooh yummy!
Micheal Vsauce Swiftor and Babish are the same people. Iluminati confirmed!
But where are the Totinos pizza rolls?  Gotta feed my hungry guys
All this money and you aren't sponsored by Ridge Wallet.
why was the one shot with the churros not colored the same?
Bruh honestly I’m just looking forward to the Super Bowl in case Mr Beast puts an advertisement saying subscribe to pewdiepie
Awful intro music
No!!!!!! I love this channel but chicken wings are to be messy and you eat all of sans bone. I cannot accept these lollipops you speak of...I CANNOT faints
Also, if your guests are wimps, just do a 1:1 ratio on the Franks and unsalted butter. Still delicious
The spoon having a beard is the best thing ive seen in a while
"wing-et" Its a flat, you wierdo
Make the soup from the beginning of Ratatouille or Russian sushi from Durarara!!.
Sweet Victory comfirmed for the halftime show
So we just find the imaginary yard with the SimpliSafe sign and we know where Babish lives!  AHA!
Got a new tattoo on your right forearm?
Burglars with Babish
do you have a spoon of your face?
what game???
naaachoooss
Candied bacon??? I see youve warched some Epic Meal Time videos
I feel like I just got diabetes from watching this ... and I’m somehow ok with that 🙃
Are wings hard to eat?
What in the hell is Franks Red hot?
These snacks aren't really what you have on game day. Who is gonna sit and cut up a bunch of wings on superbowl sunday?? Bacon? Churos? Make REAL wings, nachos, pigs in a blanket, shrimp, meatballs... finger foods made in bulk. Appetizers man, pretty basic. All this stuff is useless unless you're gonna cook for 8 hours or only feed a few people.  I don't think anyone watching this even remotely thinks of doing this for their own parties, it's not worth the time and effort
Chicken isnt big game mah fren. Good video though i like all of these
The only acceptable names are drums and flats. And you ruined the wings by cutting them.
Can you make slurp juice and the durr burger from fortnite
Alright folks, next time I do a Bob's Burgers episode, it should probably have some burgers in it...any requests?
I'm gonna start calling my lactose intolerance bathroom trips, cheese blowouts
“Everything you and your big butch boyfriends will be looking for” 
😳😏😏
Please make the Cheese sandwich from FYRE Festive......... culinary excellence
The breakfast from The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring. That one scene where they're all resting up on top of a ridge, and Merry Pippin and Boromir are sparring as the fellowship watches in amusement. 

I remember watching that scene as a kid and pausing the movie in awe at the deliciousness grilling in the pan.

Edit: Sheesh. Thank you for all the likes, people!
Footage of Babish making his life hard again
May I request a Spirited Away episode please.
Thank you. <3
definitely gonna try bringing these to the superbowl party
Holy shit you are GENIUS with the 'volcano' solution! They look perfect!
5:00 
Is it me or does it sound like he said “perfect for the big gay”
Me and my BIG BUTCH boy friends enjoyed watching this
Make the taco chip hat from despicable me
"Square-shaped... squares"

I feel let down. I wanted square-shaped circles. :-/
BABISH I HAVE AN IDEA, Kingdom Hearts 3 has a lot of very sophisticated foods in the form of the Little Chef mini game, it gives you the ingredients list in-game,including some spices, so you don't really have to do a lot of guess work, I know you said you wanted to do more video game food and I thought it'd work
Puff Pastry wants to know your location
Challenge: rewatch all his videos and take a shot when he says parchment line baking sheet
But I thought Jimmy Pesto's pizza went great with Frye?
Or My oWn DaMn HaNDs"
This episode got me puffed
Can you make noodle soup from Kung Fu Panda? Or the king size dumpling from that too
I dont know what she says to you on a daily bases... But it's not the same for me xD
brush with sesame oil
hit with sesame seeds
then sesame sesame open oven in they go!
Watching your videos is how I relax.

You should do a Good Place episode:
- Chidi's Peep Chili
- Stupid Nick's jalapeno poppers
- Fro-yo
- Etc.
ok you are probably hungry right now and you are in dorm or apartment, and you are too lazy to get up and go outside and buy food so you are here, well just to remind you, GO BACK TO STUDY AFTER THIS VIDEO AND GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT!!!!!



Have a nice day :D
So glad you know pão de queijo! Best food ever.
0:35
Go to the shop and buy some puff pastry.
Pão de queijo is the best ♡
I'm gonna keep asking until you do it: Peeps Chili from The Good Place. It would be a beautiful nightmare
I just had breakfast, yet somehow, I’m hungry again.
I came for the Mozzarella Volcanoes
This binging with Babish guy looks like the Basics with Babish guy.
Please do lobster thermador from The LEGO Batman Movie!! Thanks. Huge fan btw :)
The fruit tart from kingdom hearts 3 please ❤️💙💜
I think the next episode should be Tubby Custard or Scooby Snacks
Anyone else find the background music to be very comforting?
I'd love to see the paella from Parks and Rec season 6: Ep 13

Also the food from Fantastic Mr. Fox would be cool
oh babish, i dont think you ever had pão de queijo
Something tells me you've never had a decent pão de queijo.
brazilian PAU de queijo LOL
Lord of the Rings special - Elven waybread,  A hobbit Breakfast and second breakfast, And some orcish manflesh.
No video on Sea-salt ice cream bars on the day Kingdom Hearts 3 finally comes out. How dare you, Babish

Lol, I’m kidding, of course
I could listen to his voice to sleep and than cook a perfect medium-rare filet mignon with a cauliflower purre, while sleepwalking.  I love this voice.
So the moral of the story is to just buy the damn puff pastry
Puff pastry, I love it.
To bad my oven gave up.
Only can bake on the top stove.
Did not make puff pastry yet.
nobody:
babish: smacks pastry dough
Chief Wiggum's Insanity Chili from The Simpsons.  Good luck finding the Merciless Peppers of Quetzalacatenango (or just use Ghost Peppers)
Man, watching all your vids is making me want to see you do a Paper Mario special. Now THAT was a game full of great cooking recipes.
It’s a Crumby job but I Knead the Dough
The mozza volcanoes.  The sauce is a great touch, but consider a single bocconcini (miniature mozzarella ball) placed on top, and bake it one more time until it melts.
Mozzarella Volcanoes need mozzarella lava.
You should make food from Lord of the Rings! Lembas bread, hobbit food, Coney stew!
The way he said pão de queijo tho lmao
Why not a funnel cake? FUNNEL CAKES HERE
ALL THE HEARTHSONE REFRENCES
5:27 you weren't clear enough about the shape and I ended up with 9 spheres.
You should do super bowl snacks. Love your videos btw.
Drinking game:
Every time Babish says "Puff pastry" take a shot.
Can u make the Galapagos Island pudding from Master and Commander. There is a whole recipe companion book devoted to creating the food eatin' in the Aubrey Maturin Series.
Could you make the Super Shaggy Sandwich from Scooby Doo?? 😁
This settles it. Babish is a confirmed masochist.
I just noticed that you have a book and all the recipes in you web page.
Since found your channel i loved it! It's interesting and the final results look delicious.
I wait your answer. You're great!
You should try out a couple crockpot recipes from Don’t Starve. It’d definitely raise my sanity a few points to see an actual DragonPie recipe.
Please make the Sugar Mountain Supreme from Just Friends, for the chubby bunny.

Or the glass of water, same movie
hey, would you please do Archer next? 
Thank you🍀
Me being Brazilian hearing you say pão de queijo was the best thing I've ever heard you say

Thank you
Now that you mentioned,you should really do a brazil episode with feijoada,pão de queijo and brigadeiro
Store-bought puff pastry way too often has some kind of vegetable oil instead of butter (afaik, almost always). 
It's fit for purpose, but lacks a lot in actual taste. It's just something to be aware of.
Make sure that after you’re done eating those game day pasty snacks, remember to hold it in so you can do “Jeen’s super-bowel” and flood your competitions football game restaurant’s bathroom during, halftime
Just made puff pastry last week!!looking forward to some good tips from you :)
Hey Andrew.  May I suggest a film and a food. 

Film: Blazing Saddles 
Food: The beans Mongo and the baddies are putting away, with explosive results.

Cheers!

Please please PLEASE do the pork cutlet bowl from Yuri!!! On Ice!
"Everything you and your BIG BUTCH BOYFRIENDS are going to be looking for during the big game."

I know no one gets this
Please do lobster thermal from The LEGO Batman Movie!! Thanks. Huge fan btw :)
You should do Vegan Shepherd’s Pie from Scott Pilgrim! The recipe is even in the comic
I just found your channel and I am looking forward to making this recipe.   My request is the crazy sandwhich Adam Sandler makes in Spanglish!  It is amazing and I am interested in seeing your take on it.
Should have known but I never realized puff pastries were made like croissants
This episode may have made me hungrier than any episode you've ever done.... except the sunday gravy from goodfellas, of course :)

Would like to see you tackle some of the foods from The Good Place, it would be interesting to see your take on some of the more abstract flavours.

Fans of Great British Baking Show are screaming internally.
Go buy pre-made puff pastry 
“This is for you, babish”
Well I probably wouldn't have used that as a potato masher if I knew it was for cutting butter into flour 😭 it's broken BTW.
Would you consider Bellpeppers and beef or Miso Rock lobster from Cowboy Bebop?
1:05
OMG that wooden spoon looks like his beard and bald head upside down
Apple pie with melted cheese from TAXI DRIVER
Might be a really stupid idea, but ever thought of re-creating The Sandvitch from Team Fortress 2?
Can you make the Sea Salt Icecream from Kingdom Hearts? It's supposed to be salty and sweet
Noodle recipe or dumplings from Kung fu panda? And thank you for the seven or there about minutes I get to shut off from the rest of the world every week.

I love this show- I just have to point out because you usually correct yourself and it gives me great satisfaction to catch it when you didn’t point it out-but “square shaped squares”?
Ok those volcanoes were way too perfect looking, awesome.
Great work! I love when you take imaginary ideas and make them real! ie, they don't ever show you the dish or ingredients. What you come up with usually looks to die for!
when i can't get myself to eat enough i just watch your channel and my stomach gets excited 😂
Just done with my ebening snack and tea, but after watchin this am feeling hungry again😍😍😆😆🐼🐼😸😸 # HappyPandaLife🐼🐼

Babish! Could you do Silver's Stew from Treasure Planet?
Man, I would love to see you do a video with Harley Morenstein (From Epic Meal Time). Watching your calm demeanor and his... unique personality... would be entertaining I'd think.
as a Brazilian, it took me three hearings to understand he was referencing pão de queijo at the end

but, I mean, if it tastes like pão de queijo, it must be awesome!
please make the noodle soup from kung fu panda!!!

Big butch boyfriends 😂😂😂 I love it
Aside from being significantly faster (I assume) than the puff pastry from the Mad Men room service episode, how does this compare?
Puff pastry is butter Damascus! LooL!
I love you, you are my idol, I look up to you but never say pão de queso like that again, and love you
I'd love to see an episode on the pickled pickle from Dream Corp LLC, but that's probably illegal. Maybe an episode on pickles in general?

Hello, Humans. The water is cold, but the water is also hot. What's hot is now cold, what's cold is now hot. Things seem as they are, but are not what they seem. Ice melts and the sky falls. The water continues to flow until the end of time.

Not sure if the dish appears in any movie or TV, but I would love to see how you do pão de queijo!!! I used tapioca flour for a long time but wasn't getting the desired fluffiness/airiness and have since tried cassava flour which I find to be quite dense. Any tips are welcome!!
I feel like though not as nerdy, you should totally do the shrimp parm from The Goldbergs. It would be cool.

I am glad you didn't just buy puff pastry. It's not easily available in Brazil and a lot of recipes need them. I am so glad you showed how to make it. One of my favourite things about your channel is that you demonstrate how to make things from scratch so I can follow the recipes even if I don't find the ready ingredients.
How about a Futurama special?

What if he did the deep fried Krabby Patty on a stick and mayo from spongebob
Hi, It's Physics, The Medicine Woman also known accurately as God's Legal Guardian Angel & Existential Buddy bringing you: The truth about chimpanzees <and all other legal units>:

All chimpanzees are girls whether or not they are phallused and regardless of their legal skin color.
All chimpanzees are obligated to be held legally accountable regardless of who they know or may have heard of.
All chimpanzees are required to agree on legal reality (otherwise the sharks will eat them for being ninnie-heads [in case you were wondering: all sharks are also girls <because The Singularity {a.k.a. Legal Consciousness/Legal Reality} is feminine {it's Lady Justice, not Mr. Justice}, every legal unit is feminine regardless of shape or color. If a chimpanzee says she is feeling "muy macho", she is actually saying she is feeling rather mentally ill>]).
All chimpanzees are required to be mathematically-adherent and that includes admitting that math, rather than Ewokese or Klingon or Spanish or Tagalog or English or Swahili or Arabic, etc., is the only legal language. In case you were curious, math is the legal expression of architected reasoning, rather than being propaganda.
All chimpanzees are required to be respectful of God and The Lord (God being The Lord's charge and being correctly known as The Great Motivator and The Lord being correctly known as The Owner and meaning me, Physics, The <dour> Scottish &, fyi, [non-phallused] Mathematician, correctly known also as The Antichrist, meaning The Anti-Bully).
All chimpanzees are required to be respectful, meaning conservationist rather than consumeristic, with The Lord's things or The Lord will feed the selfish chimpanzee(s) to the sharks or the woodchipper or the guillotine to conserve resources. Marie Antoinette was a prior incarnation of mine, meaning The Lord's. I liked me as Marie Antoinette. I was also Fibonacci and Sappho and Einstein and Dr. Seuss. It's my stuff, not yours, and I have to provide for God for the rest of just about forever until we are all done yelling at each other for being exactly the right sort of annoying and we both die at the same time having lived out our math statements and that could take a while so as of this moment every holiday other than Pi Day is forbidden. The Roman pedophiles weren't that great at thinking up heroes and holidays anyway. If Jesus "Give me your kids and I'll abuse them along with you/I don't want this cup gig, thank you very much" Christ were actually that awesome, Santa Claus wouldn't have been introduced as a marketing gimmick and Groundhog Day wouldn't exist.
All chimpanzees are required to be realists, rather than storytellers, and to remember that they are here living out their math statements. Chimpanzees don't get to go to Heaven or BananaLand or Valhalla, etc. when they die just like they don't get to go to Baskin-Robbins when they die because when one dies one is dead. End of math statement. And that's okay.

The mafia (a.k.a. The Matrix) hasn't wanted you to know these important chimpanzee rules because they are a bunch of immature, selfish, cruel ninnie-heads who have been hiding math from you (the binary code has been replaced with the binumerial system/code [1001: make the most responsible and mature legal choice you can make at any juncture]) because they like you thinking they are nice and Christmas is normal as they feed you Soylent green-type food in the concentration day camps and call you "Ladies" at overnight concentration camp. Religion isn't legal. Religion is a math-evading tactic. Religion is cruel. If religion weren't practiced, there wouldn't be any homelessness. All of the mayhem going on now is completely contrived and is a fascist anarchy against you and me and God and my Scottish kids and the U.S. Military members; the math is here to end homelessness and war and crime forever, but the mafia folks have been reluctant to give up directing resources because they have been wanting to retain their cult status which includes having you tell them they are awesome for providing you with concentration camp (day or overnight) and soup lines and Christmas sweaters. You humanoids are actually girl chimpanzee junior mathematicians, rather than men and women waiting for Jesus Christ to get here to stop you from acting stupidly, although the mafia and their negro and mongloid and hispanic enforcement staff (the Romans were big on controlling migration via bullying & pitting groups against each other) wanted you to think otherwise because they have been wanting to play pretend war-mongerers with civilian populations  rather than be conservationists and they haven't minded enslaving you and my people, the Scottish, to do so.

It's time to get real folks. You don't have a choice in the matter. Sharks and all. :) Paddock was a hero who brought the issue of religion and police brutality to my attention with as small an effective bang as possible because she knew my warning I'd put forth in Las Vegas at several MGM casinos (including via surveillance camera interaction) about terrorist activity I'd noticed less than 6 weeks prior to the shooting was not being looked into as seriously as it ought to have been because the mafia didn't want to admit that The Lord and God are here on Earth and be forced to say thank you and grow up and be mature.

And now you know.

Sincerely,

The Lord, a.k.a. U.S. Military Brat 044628060.
P.S. Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM, Pierce County, WA 98433) is my direct contact and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office of the Department of Homeland Security (I call them the Where's Waldo? Investigative Squad out of fondness and professional respect [one of my jobs as Physics is to produce clean nuclear fusion energy, meaning I'm Waldo in the DHS {Department of Homeland Security} book and I have been emailing with them for two years and have an excellent relationship with a DHS field agent as well. I'm here to protect God with math and my winning personality, not to be a despotic flunktard. :)]) is my DHS contact office if you have any questions, complaints, commendations and/or sympathetic comments you'd like to make to them for having to deal with an autistic professional like me. THIS IS AN AUTISTIC THROWDOWN. Religion isn't legal. Wake up, chimpanzees. ~Physics, a.k.a. The Lord (U.S. Military Brat 044628060).
Is that a picture of your beard on your wooden spoon?!?
Everybody should make proper puff pastry once, so they know that they can, and so they know that it is almost exactly the same as the shop bought stuff and not really worth the effort.
I would love to see the omelette from One Hundred Foot Journey.

My man, you’ve been doing an amazing job. Not only are your videos relaxing to watch, but they’re also very educational. I used that Big Kahuna burger video for a cook out last year. ( don’t worry, I gave you credit.)

Mr. Babish! 
I made the Carbonara from your earlier episode - twice. Once with parmesan and once with pecorino... They both tasted like shit and I have no idea what I did wrong! 
Could it be crap quality cheese?
I may have to try that quick puff with sour cream. I like the idea of puff pastry that tastes like a buttermilk biscuit.
tastes absolutely beautiful 🤣
Is that a wooden spoon with your visage on the back?
You should do the kimchi gumbo from Searching!!!

Hey Babish, I had a burger one time that had both Guac and jalapenos basically built into the burger and as a topping. Any ideas on how to make this or other different burger ideas?
Make a vegan thing plz thanks <3
Absolutely love your video ❤️❤️
You're telling me Bob didn't have puff pastry and cheese in his kitchen?
Sorry if this is a rookie question but could you do the same "folding and rolling" technique with pie crust or would it be a different texture or something that is not good for pie crust? I made pie crust recently and I didn't use a food processor and it was super super difficult to combine. Thanks if you respond! Love the vids btw.
The jalapeños points are just weird Cornish pasties

Unrelated to this video but when I made a pie using the recipe from your channel, I found it stuck rock solid on the pyrex dish and chipped away rather than coming off easy, any tips?
It still blows my mind that Steve Buscemi delivered the line, "Do you think God stays in heaven because he too, lives in fear of what he's created?" in a kid's movie.
You should make one of the foods from dining with Dickey from the DickeyDinesShow
I caught the Letterkenny reference and apparently no one else did.
You should make a app
Do the cheese sandwich from Fyre festival.
I kind of want to see Babish’s take on the Potage le Magnifique from Skyrim.
Was anyone else able to smell the sour cream when he plopped it into the mix?
I really wanna see Babish do an episode where he recreates the food that was SUPPOSED to be at Fyre Festival!!!!!!!

Why a wooden spoon specifically?
Best burgers I ever ate: my buddy in b-lo, thor, called 'em "sex burgers".  You can't make em, it was like: maybe a quarter lean gb, a quarter mineo & sapio italian,  venison I think was in there, shredded cheese of all kinds, garlic, lord knows what, spices, oxford commas: and love.  Greatest thing i ever ate.  but a burger oughta be grilled outdoors anyway, bad for the shot and cameras, good for the soul.
I´ll  wait for next year
1:02 i like the custom lookin spoon js
Off topic question but it seems relevant given what has been going on on Youtube recently. Have you ever been hit with any copyright claims because of the clips you use in the beginning of your videos? I've seen a lot of people hit with that recently.

I love you babish, but if you're describing something made with puff pastry as being like Pao de Queijo then you haven't had legit pao de queijo. It should be dense and chewy and  cheesy and delicious but not really light and flakey like puff pastry.

Just saw this episode two days ago LOL
this was my favorite bobs burgers episode
We need the flanders special babby
My method of making puff pastry is shorter. I drive to the supermarket. Takes less than twenty minutes.
You should try making one of Edgar's Breakfast meals from You're The Worst.
You make it because classic puff made with good butter is considerably tastier than store bought, which is either made with shortening and commercial dough conditioners, or expensive as hell.
Babish goes good with Frye!
Babish, I think you should be my big, butch boyfriend.
because most bought puff pastry these days contains f*****g palm oil! that's the biggest reason to make your own, or try very very hard to find proper "all butter".
NZ loves puff pastries
Wait I don't get the That's what she said joke
What about the sweet pastries?
can you make ice bear's calzone from we bare bears?
With a thumbnail like that, i thought it was a basics episode
Loved it!! 👌
But do they go great with Frye?
I'm slightly curious why you wouldn't grate frozen butter into the flour, rather than chopping it into chunks and then cutting it together.
I haven't tried it, but is there any particular eason why that wouldn't work?
Rough puff pastry is easier than both, and whilst you don’t get the layers, it’s better than anything you can buy. Also rolling out on the underside of a chilled baking sheet is a good hack for keeping the pastry cold whilst rolling.
Make a parks and recreation episode! I wanna see the meat tornado!

saugage roll bruh
I remember once when I was watching my grandma cook, I didn't really know what she was cooking (I was quite young), but I'm now certain it was a puff pastry.  I don't know the recipé (as previously stated, I was quite young), but she did the layering bit with melted butter.  Roll out the dough, apply melted butter, fold left/right edges to center, apply melted butter, fold top/bottom edges to center, roll out dough, repeat.

Again, I don't know the recipé, and at this point I can't ask, so I don't know if there was anything added to the melted butter she used, but I thought I'd mention this here as it certainly doesn't require refrigeration pauses in prep.

Hey Andrew, I’ve been watching all your episodes religiously and I just wanted to say that I’m really happy for you and all the success that you’ve achieved. You deserve it. It’s wonderful watching you do what you love and inspiring for people like me who just love cooking. Anyways, keep up the good work. I look forward to more of your episodes!
I like how little more obscure this food from bob burgers was. Made me remember the episode and get excited to see these appetisers!
That's what she said... I am sorry.😂😂😂

Go go go with your jokes and laugh. Cant wait til comes right back on you.
When hearing the names of the appetizers I had completely different ideas of what they would be (ah the creativity of cooking!). This video was massively impressive, and I'm worried the title wont garner it all the attention it deserves, specifically from those who haven't discovered you yet. AND the fact that you squeezed all of this into less than 8 minutes is a whole other feat. You killed it on this! I will definitely come back here when I need to make homemade puff pastry!

the only problem with this is that you need to know in advance that you have to freeze your butter :P

What must I do to get you to do a guest episode with Foodwishes?
you make me hungry.
I feel robbed. In the UK we call quick Puff Pastry methods "Rough Puff" and half the fun of making it is saying ruff puff over and over to yourself. We totally missed out on Babish saying ruff puff.
He mixed it with his face
Thank you for teaching me this resapy so now I'll get you a tip, before grilling a patty flatt the patty then put bbq in the middle then fold the outer patty over it then whiyle grilling the patty, squish the patty to make it juicier and have some evaporated gasses get out. And that is how you make a BBQ patty.
Loving the spoon with Babish's silhouette.
what happened to pt 2 of the bubba shrimp
That looked delicious... If I could make a request it would be for 'la bombe' from the simpsons episode 'Guess who's coming to Criticize Dinner' (the giant eclair that is used to try and kill homer), just to see whether it's actually possble to fit 25 pounds of butter in a square inch.
Please do food from How I Met Your Mother!! Like Erickson’s 7-Layer Salad, the Minnesota Tidal Wave aka the Robin Scherbatsky, and Sumbitches!!!!!

I make similar cheese twists but I also add a ridiculous amount of garlic powder too. Theyre delicious 😍
This is a really obscure request... I don't know if you've ever seen the Disney Channel Original Movie classic that is "Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off", but I have, more than I'd like to admit. I would absolutely LOVE to see your interpretation of the iconic "sauce". As someone who loves to cook myself, the question of what could possibly be in it (especially to be described as "like barbecue sauce, but better!") is one for the ages, and I trust you to figure it out.

I really enjoy watching your channel. The way you cook and your approach to food as a whole is amazing!

Having said that, I don't like that you don't provide measures for ingredients in grams/milliliters and/or that there are no subtitles in the film or full recipes in show notes.

Not only you speak way to fast for not having subtitles for ingredients, your cooking isn't that easy and obvious and not everyone makes a living out of it (as you do I assume), so watching your videos over and over and converting the measures isn't worth an effort.

It would take you or your producing partner/-s few minutes and would make your content more useful and approachable.


Think about it : )
Both recipes for puff pastry take longer than the time it takes to go to the supermarket and buy puff pasty. I'll stick to the store-bought stuff.

My theory on babish’s banana allergy:

Ok, so here’s what I gathered: there are 5 instances of babish making a dish with bananas. The hangover cure from the cocktail special, triple-decker eggo extravaganza, home made ice cream, banana pudding pizza, and Rachel’s English trifle. 
We are first introduced to the idea that babish is allergic to bananas in the cocktail episode when he made the hangover cure. He says that he went into anaphylactic shock the last time he ate bananas. He even makes it a point to ready an epi-pen in case he goes into anaphylactic shock. He doesn’t. 
Later, in the trifle and eggo episodes, he makes and samples two different banana containing dishes without so much as a mention of his allergy. However, in the home made ice cream episode, he makes it clear that he cannot try the banana ice cream due to his elusive banana “allergy”. 
There is only one theory that makes sense to me and that is the following: before he became the beautiful bald babish that we know and love, he had an incident with bananas that sent him into anaphylaxis (this is mentioned briefly in the cocktail episode). After trying the hangover cure, babish was supposed to see that nothing happened. It seemed as if his banana allergy was gone. Or was it ever there to begin with? Questioning the nature of his previous allergic reaction, he decides that he is in fact not allergic to bananas. This new found freedom leads babish to make and eat the trifle and the eggo extravaganza. This is where it gets hazy. There must be something in between the trifle episode and the ice cream episode that makes babish realize without a shadow of a doubt that he is, in fact, allergic to bananas. He must have eaten something off camera with bananas as an ingredient and had a reaction. Confused by this sudden turn of events, babish knew that the only way to know for sure is to visit the doctor and get tested for a banana allergy. After finding out from the doctor that he is in fact allergic to bananas, he then makes the ice cream episode stating explicitly that he is not allowed to eat these dishes due to his allergy. In the banana pudding pizza episode he clearly eats the pizza crust first, making sure that he does not eat any banana slices and makes his friend Sawyer try all the dishes as a stand in taste tester.

Awesome
I don't think babish has ever made dough without saying the word "cohesive"
Why not try laminating the puff pastry with a pasta maker? It's quicker then rolling by hand, so the butter has less time to melt...
Music?
Hey, Babish, I’m wondering if you can make something sweet that came from Pokémon! Is it possible for you to make the Poké Puffs from Pokémon X and Y??? It’s like cupcakes, but for Pokémon. You can see how they look by looking at vids about Pokémon Amie or watch the Pokémon X and Y anime. By the way, I love the things you recreated!! ❤️

Another great episode! I know this might be a really random request, but do you think you can do an episode on kitchen cleanup and upkeep? I am such a newbie to cooking, but the hardest part about getting into it that it looks like a lot of effort to clean up afterwards. It'd be cool to get any best tips or practices to maintain a clean and organized kitchen!
nice watch, so babish.
Banish is thanos
Language  error. It's baking  parchment  or baking paper . NOT  parchment paper, as that make no sense. Parchment  is  synonymous with paper  ( it is means the same and so is interchangeable) saying parchment paper  you are literally  saying I used paper paper! This is a common error made by a number of Americans, which often  makes us brits burst out laughing at how dumb it makes you guys sound.
Where is the chebureki
What, I do beg pardon of you Yank lot,  is “bing-ing” (which, so spelled, rhymes with flinging, and bringing, and clinging,etc.) ?  Or does one perchance intend to “binge” upon this clever chap’s offerings? Which, naturally, and also cleverly, would be spelled “bingeing...”   Please, no offence meant, because truly, it is better to be a clever cook than a clever speller, but one must trade upon one’s gifts. But I was merely fearful of being ignorant of some new form of revelry...  ta ra.

Can you make something from the Good Place? Maybe frozen yogurt! Or Chidi’s Peeps and M&Ms chili, I know you already did a big shrimp episode but maybe some of the flavors from Eleanor’s shrimp dispenser?
Show your support and make B!tch Lasagna from Pewds!

Yummy
is that your god damn melon on that spoon
“‘Thats what she said’, I’m sorry.”
Hey Babish, relatively recent viewer here but avid nonetheless. I saw a video recently of champion weightlifter Brian Shaw making his average lunch which consisted of rice and minced bison most prominently and it looked awful, lacking in spices, herbs and even the basic salt/pepper combo. Anywho, lacking any and all culinary skill myself, I wondered if you could take those ingredients (plus the others he used) to make some kind of Indian keema rice inspired dish, or possibly a Byriani of some kind. Just an idea. Thank you, love the videos, keep up the great work :)
Jalapeño points need bacon so bad!
Anyone else notice the markings on the wooden spoon at the beginning...? Is that Babish's beard on a spoon...?
Food is great
This makes me ridiculously happy.  Those were probably just goofy names that they just came up with, and you've turned them all into actual creations that absolutely deserve the names.  Although, considering Bob's Burgers, at least one of the writers had recipes for all of them.
How did you get the mark on the triangles ? It looks like a brand!
It’s hilarious considering Babish opted to make his own puff pastry for the Mad Men episode, then said he wouldn’t for the Emperor’s New Groove episode, then again made puff for this one. You never cease to surprise us, Babish.
Maybe a food wars episode?
how do you not have your own restaurant at this point




and how come you don't have another cookbook to teach us how to make this stuff
One word, YUMMMMMMMY......😀
make a statement, and stop using plastic wrap. It's terrible
Babs if I were you I woulda used pizza dough for the mozzarella volcanoes. It just makes more sense. Mozzarella and pizza dough just go so well together with pizza and calzones. Your volcanoes are basically meatless stromboli
Make Tubby Custard from Teletubbies.
pee sized
Who does all your dishes?
Fish fingers and custard from doctor who!
can i get a track id plz?
I think that the white cake from Django Unchained would be a good way for you to show some different ways of making cakes. maybe a beginner method and a pro method.
are you a certified chef?
So is no one talking about how Babish has his mug on his spoon?
is it just me or does the chedder not look like real Chedder at all?
Open a restaurant
Hey Babish, in a cookoff between Gordon Ramsay, Ainsley Harriot, and yourself, who do you think would win, and what would you make? You all try each other's dish and rate it unbiased.
DID ANYBODY SEE THE KNIFE MOVE ON ITS OWN?!?
Hey Babish, you should try to make the cotton candy burrito which is cotton candy wrapped around ice cream and rainbow sprinkles. Also known as unicorn poop.
Please tell me you have a cookbook or one in the books for future man I wanna try all these recipes on paper! 😁
I kept pausing but couldn't tell what kinda watch Babs was wearing. Does anybody recognize it?
Am I the only one or does babish sound almost a bit over motivated today?
I’d like to have seen how this would’ve turned out if he just used burger ingredients to try to make these
watches while eating microwaved poptart puff pastry....interesting....
Where’s the jelly fish jelly sandwich?
Sorry to burst your bubble babish, but a lot of supermarkets DON'T carry puff pastry, the ones in my city don't, the ones in the city an hour away from me don't. It's not as widely available as you think
Babish I have a hot chocolate recipe if you could try it. 225 ml of milk with a dash of 10% cream. 4 dashes of cinnamon. A hand full of chocolate chips. A cap full of vanilla. A tea spoon  of sugar and premixed hot chocolate powder.and a tea spoon of butter. Please try
Hey can you make Jake´s Sandwich from two and a half men, Season 6 episode 10, please?
there is NO SUCH THING as "quick" puff pastry.....  not at all quick!
Does anyone actually make these? Or just likes to watch them.
KGF
You should make Scooby Snacks that humans and dogs can eat!
i work in a bakery and when we roll out pie crust or sugar cookies, instead of adding tons of flour to the rolling pin/dough, we just put plastic wrap on top of the dough and roll out on top of that. it never sticks and its better for the dough since youre not adding extra flour to it
Woop
My big, butch ( hah ) boyfriends can get their own puff pastry.  Anyway,  there was a restaurant in New Orleans about 30 years ago called the "Fatted Calf".  They had a burger called the "Romanov" .  It was this big juicy patty, toasted brioche bun, with sour cream,  a hard boiled egg white ring with caviar in it and the yolk crumbled up over it.  OMG, it was the best !!  If nothing else,  it's a god way to camouflage cheap caviar.  See how your butch boys like that.
Honestly, a few of the replies from the fallout universe would be kinda cool. Only problem is you would have to guess what was in it... apparently deathclaw taste like pork.
Please teach us how to make that fish dish from Kiki’s delivery service
Goddammit, this is seriously making me consider quitting keto. Why do I torture myself with cooking channels?
You should do the chocolate from Charlie and the chocolate factory
You should do the weird disgusting sandwich that Zac Efron made in 17 again
זה בורקס
Hey Babish, have you ever had a juicy Lucy? It’s a burger with cheese on the inside. I’d highly recommend it
Gotta learn how to cook like this if we want some big butch boyfriends.
His spoon. Has his face on it. I’ll take 10
No offense. I dislike puff pastry. However I'm watching the full video as it is babish himself after all.
Babish, is it safe to say you burned your mouth @ 6:13 ? I could feel the steam lol
Sorry but tbh bobs burgers ain’t funny, it never got unfunny with age like family guy and the Simpsons because it never was funny
What about some of those recipes that Townsend’s always cooks? Bring the 18th Century into the 21st!

That said, it time for me to pop on Springsteen’s halftime show - the only halftime show that’s ever mattered.
Do Tony Load from The Incredibles!!!
You gotta do something from my hero academia
Make Sea Salt Ice Cream from Kingdom Hearts
I Came, I Saw the Coleslaw Burger.
So toasted jalapeno puffs are the spanish version of krunks spinach puffs
Why is no one talking about the fact that the wooden spoon he used @1:02 has his face on it?

I want one

"...everything you and your big, butch boyfriends are gonna be looking for during the big game."

I'm sorry, can you say that again? I didn't hear those words come out of your mouth, I was mistaken, right? That isn't a thing you said, I'm just crazy, right?
The food from the grand Budapest
I’m here because my school just served the most awful “puff pastry” I’ve ever had in my life.
Babbish face on a wooden spoon.. was that the same person that did the pizza peel?
Ummm Babish has a wooden spoon with his facial hair on it??
Just a little more to 4 million
Hey guys please watch the video on my channel. Dont worry it's just a few seconds. Wont take much time
A++ for the pronunciation of Pão de queijo!! Good job, bud ✌🏽
Could we get measurements in grams instead of sticks, outside of US it would be hard to get the same amount. 
The same with the cups of flower, how much grams is one cup?
This is amazing, I always laughed at his weird ass appetizer ideas. Also Sandy Frye is a snake
Those jalapeño poppers were bourekas dude, deep fry them if you want poppers
Forget the tiny whisk, Babish needs more damhands.
My school make sesame cheddar blasts in an hour starting from scratch and we make 5 dozens of them
why i dont buy anything premade because its full of artifical flavours and colors, as well as unwanted ingredients such as BHT which is a petroleum based derivitive used as a preserver.
When you remember he went through this hell once before and said the same thing back then too
That’s what she said... I’m sorry 
😂😂😂
none of these actually looked appetizing to me lol
Dude not even my patisserie instructor made her own puff pastry if she could avoid it! Anything with lamination: too serious a commitment for me
All I heard this episode is "Puff"
When are you going to start selling cookware Babish, don't act like I didn't see that amazing wooden spoon with the beard
Anybody automatically think of the "...my hungry guys" sketch from SNL when they hear "the big game."?
Best line in this video "Big Butch Boyfriends"
Rough puff! Nice
how about some recipes from FX's You're the worst? it has a lot of great (but sped up) cooking scenes and is currently on it's last season so itd be a great way to honor it.
i didn't know youtube let porn video, but this is pure porn you know
the jalapeño pastries you made are actually called bourekas. it’s a turkish pastry usually filled with cheese, potatoes, or beef
Make something from the cook the thief the wife and her lover
The way you say "pão de queijo" is adorable. Cheers from Brazil!
i lived to see Babish say “pão de queijo” and oh boy am i happy
he should try making some someday!
What about Courage's the Cowardly Dog foods?

LIKE THE MACARONI! "Less cheese".
Those sesame cheddar bombs look suspiciously like chef John's cheese straws.
Cinnamon pie from Psych or Pitt Cola from Gravity Falls!
Can't. Unhear. Archer. IT'S STERLING AGAIN.
Don't ever apologize for a "that's what she said"
I remember you posting a list of your favourite recipes from the show, do you update it sometimes? Could you host an updated list on your website and/or on Google docs or something? Thanks!
Babish is really damn good when it comes to creativity like wtf?
Cajun food from DS9
Do a Yakitate Japan! Like the Bread baked in a Rice Cooker!
Did you shave your arm hair......?
CLICKBAIT
Big Butch Boys, Better Be pleased.
babish your spoon
Was that a custom babish spatula at 1:02?
God I’m hungry
If you need pea sizr butter cant you just cut the butter really small? or is the cube butter have some ither thing that helps the dough
have you ever had a stomach ache and didnt want to eat even when you have to go out to eat with someone? i watch these videos to male me hungry. it works.
Babish,you should do Indian food
These look way better than having to watch Tom Brady play another god damn super bowl.
Do some pao de queijos and coxinhas
Please do absolutely anything from FFXV. Ignis makes it all with camp gear so I think that’d be a cool challenge for it
Worth it just to hear Andrew try to say "pão de queijo". :D
I challenge you to make Best burger In the world form Regular show Season 3 episode 21
Cheese Sandwich from Fyre Festival
It would be a great sight to see babish working with chef Ramsay
We make something similar to those jalapeno poppers/toasted jalapeno points but we call them burekas!
My mothers tried and true recipe for pie crust is extremely similar to the sour cream recipe, except that she bring all the ingredients together in a food processor. Comes out delicious and flakey every time!
the noodles from pucca or the wingerdingers from recess would be cool to see be brought to life
You should try to make Piaya from Philippines Bacolod
Doesn't use Kosher salt

House blows up
I love Bob's Burgers!
"twist them into twist"

I love Bob's Burgers! Thank you for the upload
“Big butch boyfriends” best quote of 2019
Thats what im calling food porn, cheese <3
I finally know why new episodes take forever to come out! You make puff pastry
Please attempt to make Ed's sauce from goodburger
Make sea salt ice cream from kingdom hearts
also, as a brazilian (and no offense to fellow brazilians) I bet the puffy pastry with cheese you made is way better than any pão de queijo
Howdy, kingdom hearts 3 is coming out. If you wanted to do a thing to honor that, or catch some of the hype you could make sea salt ice cream.
Do food from Skyrim.
Would you consider making Tonio Trussardi's dishes from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure? They're very Italian
I want to see a Babish collab with How to Drink
Life of Boris special?
A How I Met Your Mother special would be brilliant. There's that whole episode dedicated to burgers, the pizza roadtrips, Barney's hangover cure, grape scotch. Marshall's undying love for food (and so many monologues about it), the Erikson family Funyun salad, Shrimp in the pocket, The Turturkeykey (Which I feel like I should morally object to but great for the purposes of this).
I just barely noticed his wooden spoon has the Babish Beard emblazoned on it.  Neat.
Hey Babbish, long time fan here, I was wondering if you would consider doing a basics episode regarding the Keto diet (high fat, low carbs) I myself noticed not many indepth recipe guides, and it'd be a way for you to introduce healthy diet recipes that don't stray to far from you usual recipe
Am I the only person here that wants to know flour in cups and butter in sticks?  The fact that you add the water until the dough takes on the correct feel suggests that precision in the first two ingredients is fairly pretentious.  I don't mean to be negative, but I don't have a scale and I don't plan on ever buying one.  That said, the food looked great!!  Cheers.
Babish can you do Baklava?
Brazilian hwat now?
Question: what does gluten do? Why do people want less or more of it?
Do you not have cheese twists in America?
How do you keep doing Bob's Burgers, and not even attempt more from Shokugeki no Soma? Serious qualitative difference in creativity and entertainment....
The tomato sauce does give the mozzarella volcanoes more taste but Some hot sauce would have been more accurate.
Please do some dishes from Kingdom Hearts 3. Remmy from Ratatouille helps you make them too!
I've been wanting to experiment with puff pastry, I've never used it before. These would be some great recipes to try. Thanks a lot Babish, for everything!
Great episode. I would really like to see an episode with some of the recipes from the movie Chocolat. Thank you
I know I would love to see your interpretation of Klingon food. 😁
It's midnight and I still have my classes tomorrow but dang it. Must. Watch. New. Vid
7:27 During the big gay XD nice one
Oh my god Andrew is familiar with Brazilian food? And i thought this show couldn't get any better
Who told you about my butch boyfriends?!
6:17 6:18
The biggest surprise about this video is someone actually watching Bob's Burgers.
I would be weary of that knife of yours I think it's possessed 0:43
Big game??
“That’s what she said”
             -Babish 2019
"Big butch boyfriend"? Is there something you havent told us about Babish?
babish always makes me want to bake, but then I start baking something and I remember... I hate it
I dont think I'll be the only one who dies if he makes the sluzzlewurst from the amazing world of gumball
You should do the burritos as big as your head from bojack horseman
Gougeres.  A savory puffy pastry made from choux dough.

Made by boiling butter, milk, and water. Then throwing flour in and stirring into a massive lump of steaming hot dough. Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes. Add a lot of eggs. Then your herbs, spices, and cheese. Scoop or pipe into balls on a silpat covered sheet. Brush on some egg wash and cover with grated parmigiano reggiano. Bake and the puff up. Leaving a crispy exterior and creamy airy interior.
How dare you compare Pão-de-Queijo to puff pastry? How dare you???
You should do a despicable me episode!! 😂😂

With the cookies they sold, or that chip hat filled with guacamole
Broodwhich
Aqua Teen Hunger Force
The most beautiful parts of this video was the little crumbles of puff pastry falling from the top of the screen whenever Babish ate some of it
That BWB wooden spoon is amazing
You should make a dish with Gordon Ramsey
I challenge you to make the 96oz steak from The Great Outdoors called The ole 96er
On no made puff pastry again...the absolute mad lad
I love how everyone is suggesting burgers from bobs burgers that he’s already done
Pls do the Mississippi queen from regular show
please do the meal from the teen titans (netfix series)
Please do a House MD Special!
Peter knife hands version is the ultimate version so get your butter to smaller pieces.
"during the big gay"
Did anyone else catch the design on the spoon at the beginning?
5:29 as opposed to triangle shaped squares.
Andrew can u make hainanese chicken pls
Nice wooden spoon

Do JoJo's bizarre adventures please their are so many recipes you can do
I always get so hungry watching Babish😭💘
Can you make White Cake from Django Unchained?
Ahh laminating dough, LOL the bane of my cooking existence! 😁 What’s your take on those marble boards — do you think they’re worth the cost vs just using a regular countertop / table?
Great episode, but what's a dam hand?
that was a m a z i n g, good sir- need to hire someone as like, a permanent taste tester?
Good lord these look delicious. Nice job Babish
How about American psycho?
Sea urchin ceviche, mud soup with charcoal arugula, and pork loin with lime jello
Random question: Did you lose weight?
Try making the new York max
I thought mozzarella volcanoes where cheese sticks
I just can't wait for babish to do a video showing on Lobster Thermidor Aux Cravettes Topped with a Mornay Sauce, Garnished with a Truffle Pate, Brandy, with Two Fried Eggs On Top, and some Spam. 
or Frozen Yogurt from The Good Place, although finding the "Full Cell Phone Battery" flavor might be difficult.
I demand you use the other music in videos
Maybe make the giant wonton soup from The Kings of Summer? (Or just watch the scene with Nick Offerman and Kumail Nanjiani it's very funny.)
Look puff pastry is cool, but a cheese grater with a bottom on it you can remove for a cheese waterfall? What a time to be alive.
Really reminds me of burekas
Did that spoon have a Babish beard? I need that spoon.
You mentioned pão de queijo, so, I'm just gonna say that
Pão de Queijo should be elected as a national treasure of Brazil

Goddam that thing is good
"Thats what she said, Im sorry" 😂😂😂 youre the best
Do Sea Salt ice cream from Kingdom Hearts 2.
We can't even get Dufour here. Just Pepperidge Farm. Unfortunate since Pepperidge Parm is not all butter.

although I have done the homemade puff pastry, and the rough puff pastry (not what's made in this video) before. Both are absolutely delicious.
Cheese Blowouts at 5:40. Sounds like another recipe.
How about you do any food from Stardew Valley?
Stew from nacho libre or chese smoothie from zeek and Luther
Human Polenta-pede Burger.
NEW WATCH -- NICE
I believe a single fold (in-half) followed by “like 2” trifolds would multiply the existing layer count by 18. But I’m not judging your math. Merely observing the fact that you’ve made homemade puff pastry twice on this show and regretted it both times :) love ya babby
they shan't be jalepeno poppers until they have the bacon
I love before school babish
that moment your wife says " id let him (Babish) brush me down with egg wash".......
Digging the wooden spoon!
EVIL ORANGE CHEESE
Does that wooden spoon have a Babish beard? 1:02
I don’t cook and I’m very picky but I seriously can’t get enough of these videos
Your Spanish is horrible! Lolol! Ya big gay, gay guy!💖💖💖
What's this? A sort of Basics with Babish hidden INSIDE a Binging episode? Well isn't that efficient
any non fat non carb snacks?
How about Mallow's Alola Stew Pikachu's Thunderbolt version in Pokemon Sun and Moon episode 18?
Wooooooooooooooo he talked about our god and saviour Pão de queijo, one of the best snacks we have to offer alongside Coxinhas;
Mozzarella Volcanoes would definitely be larger than that, Andrew.
damn i am early also yes bobs burgers
Suggestion: The Turducken Slammer from Supernatural. I think it'd be hilarious to actually see it made.
I live in Australia and my ice cold water keeps turning into lava, what do I do?
"My own DAMN hands". The phrasing just called to mind your hands acting as a Dam...
Great, now my keyboard is full of drool...
The volcanoes are SO cute! 🤪
when this channel became facebook cooking videos
Omg his spoon at 1:02! That’s amazing
Where can I get that wooden spoon that looks like it had you face at 1:02
I absolutely need it!
When is Babish gonna quit screwing around and make the burrweedo’s from Workaholics???
Please make the Winchester surprise!!!
If that joined the clean plate club babish would be too diabetic to do the 'signature walk in' next episode
Now you would think these are perfect appetizers for your Superbowl party, and while they do look something guests would love, if you serve a bunch of puff pastry snacks to everybody you're going to be left with a living room absolutely COVERED in crumbs.
Now you would think these are perfect appetizers for your Superbowl party, and while they do look something guests would love, if you serve a bunch of puff pastry snacks to everybody you're going to be left with a living room absolutely COVERED in crumbs.
You should make the hobo that lives next to my dumpster’ s favorite food. He said it’s white powder in a clear bag.
Why am I watching this high?
Is no one going to bring up the mini-Babish on the wooden spoon?
Loving the custom Babish wooden spoon there Andy 😂😂
That doesn't look at all like the texture of a pão de queijo. But looks good though <3
Kingdom hearts III came out today, so why not do a kingdom hearts special?
Hi Babish. Please do the beans and bread from the opening scene of "They Call Me Trinity" (1970)! :)
I just watched a Bob's burger video from you like 10 minutes ago
Love the volcanos! Creative solution.
Square shaped squares? Why not circle shaped squares?

When are we going to see the circle shaped squares though? But seriously, another great episode Babish!
Poor Bob couldn't make these appetisers, only burgers
Did that spoon have your face on it or am I imagining it
Anyone else notice when he was mixing the dough with the wooden spoon that the back of the spoon had his mustache on it?
Seriously...buy layered dough.  I remember making it in culinary school and thinking, "I'm NEVER doing this again."  It's quite the pain in the ass...and that's when it goes well.  Let the butter get too warm and watch what happens.  lol
Gownd
Chicken and milk stew from Goblin Slayer?
You nailed those volcanoes! Good job.
Can you make the Slusseldog from  The Amazing World of Gumball?
Watching BwB is becoming a daily habit LMAO

Whoa there, they're macho man friends, bucko babby!
Is something wrong with the focus or am I going crazy ?...
Since Mardi Grad and Carnival is coming up, how about you teach how to make a classic king cake.
Is that your face on your spoon!!!
Oh my goodddddddd I miss bobs burgers
grated butter?
nice alliteration.
Me want!
What would happen if you added grated cheese instead of the butter?
"Babish and the Big Butch Boyfriends" is the name of a children's book that is not for children.
Why do all Americans use cheap nasty nuclear orange artificially coloured cheddar?
if you wanted the cold butter to be pea sized then couldnt you have cut it into smaller cubes? then mixed it
Meh
Yay pão de queijo episode coming up?
You are, after all the Andrew Rea of making my day!
Boi look at that magnificent beard on the wooden spoon, excellent touch babish
I love how you start with rough puff, make an excuse for why you're doing rough puff, then do almost as many steps as a proper puff pastry with full lamination. Babish, never change.
Can we get you on Bob's Burgers??
The SPOON THO. It has a beard!
Can you do Caramade Franks from Fairy Tail?
Moist.







thats it... why'd you click this anyway.
Babish whats the intro song??? ive been trying to find out for ages :(

Babby, Basic Instinct is my favorite movie. I think there's some food in there to make an episode (a diner scene? and some others where they eat). So dooo iiiit.
Anyone else notice the babish spoon?
5:29. Square shaped squares you say ? Mhhmm...
You should do a Kingdom Hearts episode, in celebration of the new game and the food you can cook in it such as; Tarte Aux Fruits, Mushroom Terrine, Sole Meunière and loads more, Or even try making sea salt ice cream!
Have you considered doing a kitchen tour? Would love to see one!

What's the difference between Puff Pastry and Butter Dough? Doesn't the Butter Dough also puff up? Recipes seems kinda similar.
Wow I'm hungry.
1:40 puff pastry doesn't exist in my country :'(
Um....we just have burgers and fries
I might steal this recipe to make Chinese egg tarts.  Thanks Babish.

Please make Tonio's food from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable!
Can you pls make chilli dog from sonic the hedgehog?
Never thought I would see Babish making puff pastry from scratch again after that Beef Wellington episode
Didn’t you make puff pastry from scratch once before? Great work either way.
This is great when you can't sleep. Sup from Australia 😁
I misread the title and thought it said "Fyre" so you should do an episode for Fyre Festival's infamous meal
Didn’t you make puff pastry from scratch once before? Either way, great work as always.
I did the calculations and the results are in!




This looks tasty
This is so much easier than the old-time-y way they did in on Townsend’s channel 😂
skyrim foods already?
Make the Mississippi Queens from regular show
I think The Ultimate Sandwich by Ninja Sex Party would make a perfect episode.
Hey Babish, just wondering if you could talk about the watches you wear on the show
G'day mate
This episode has so much cheese
They all look so tasty, can't wait to try and make them!
Hi babish, can you do the creamy cheesecake from friends?
Can you make Beef Stew from The Benchwarmers?
You’re killing me, man! Doing puff pastries but not Kronk’s spinach puffs??
you made burrekas (or Borek) basically 
google it
Make the M&Ms Peeps Chili from The Good Place. 😂😂😂
Puff pastry is one of the best things I kno
one recipe i wanna see from you is the spongebob Bon-Bons
Do the banana onion juice from avatar the last air bender!
1:01 : The spoon has Babish's (Andrew's) face on it... Lol
I feel like The Fantastic Mr. Fox would have tons of ideas for a video, cider, bucket of fish, etc.
I thought that wooden spoon was Vsauce Michael Here
Moral Lesson: Buy puff pastry
right when i wanted to start working lol

-Babish, 2019
My life puffed up so much while watching this.
The fact that you haven't recreated any of Skyrims many dishes you can make is a crime. Specifically, I NEED A SWEETROLL FROM YOU AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE.
Hey Babish,can you try making Sea Salt ice cream from Kingdom Hearts?
Man this guy loves kocher salt
I wonder if all other aspects of Andrew's life are as -- cohesive-- as his doughs...
babish saying Big Butch Boyfriends is something I never knew I wanted or needed until now
I survive off a mixture of Babish, Diarrhea Planet and my cat, tony.
Genuine question why is American cheddar so orange? Its really odd, looks kinda like red Leicester.
176th!
Question, why not use black sesame on the twists if you were using them for visuals? Is there a big enough difference in taste (I'm sure price yes) between regular and black sesami?
Andrew.
yeet
These all seem so unhealthy. I’ll take 20.
Is it just me, or did his voice change? His voice is a tad bit higher.
I can’t watch this show without getting hungry

Will you make food from Today's Menu for the Emiya Family? The food from that anime looks delicious, especially the Omurice one.
Make the Fyre festival Cheese sandwich!
Still waiting on that Part Two of the Forrest Gump vid...
I remember the unit on laminated doughs from Fundamentals of Baking in Culinary school. When we got to puff pastry, it amounted to "Sure, you could make your own, but why? Lets make croissants instead."
Why don’t you make the cheese sandwiches from the Frye festival
Who are you rooting for this Sunday?

That wooden spoon has ur face painted on it

I love cooking sooo yeah is my dream to be one
Banish, do you deliver?
Do mi goreng on basics
Still waiting hoping for him to make sth from Chowder
LOL about making vs. just buying puff pastry.  Yeah, it's readily available, and even out here in "fly-over" country, my wife and I generally have some in the freezer.  The store bought variety freezes quite well, but let it defrost in the fridge (or that's what we do, anyway.)  Next, on to filo!  No, that is also available everywhere and way easier to buy than make.

Thanks, man, and thumbs up as usual.
Make dragon ball food

Or Naruto Ramen
EVERY TIME HE COMPLAINS ABOUT MAKING THE PUFF PASTRIES. JUST BUY THE PASTRY, MAN. ;-;

Can you make a bad excuse to make croissants. Something like the croissants from the Phineas and Ferb rollercoaster episode. Thanks
The most incredible part of proofing bagels is that 6 turn into 8 when kept in the fridge overnight. majestic
Could you make Fantastic Mr. Fox    nutmeg ginger apple snaps 🦊 🍎
Why is nobody else noticing that this is the first ever BWB episode, that does not have the iconic voiceover, but instead this 'live' talk... 😶 Great video nevertheless of course! But just so unusual and I personally also like it much better with the voice over since it kind of is one of the main characteristics of BWB...
4:43 About 9 inches. hmm cool cool cool yes. 9 inches, I am familiar.
You really missed the opportunity to call it bagels with babish

Whoa Andrew, did I see that correctly? You have 2 IMDB pages?
Is that some Nujabes in the background?
I want to see the testing process where they determined 14.66 ounces was the right amount.

That crunch when they bite into them was satisfying
Hey Babish have a link to the music toward the end?
Lol Babish be pumping out them videos!
i don't usually complain on your videos babish.
But you should work on getting better audio, for you + any guests, during your in-kitchen scenes. Your voice over audio is great... But i can barely hear you+dan talking, without turning up the volume - while i can EASILY hear your voice over. 
Just a thought you could work on :)
Nice video though!
Can you use sourdough starter with these? And how would that change the recipe?

My grandpa once have said... If you want to make real bagels you must add Apple Juice. He was working in bakery on NY do It must be true.

Please make the Winchester surprise from supernatural!!!
Note to self: grease baking rack
I love using onion bagels as hamburger buns. For me it's just not a proper burger otherwise.

BTW, you just gave me the biggest NYC feelings 😭😭😭 I wanna go back!!!
I'm loving the new music selection Babby 👌 
Keep up the good work

Those are some sad looking bagels. Mine always get flat like that too
THEYRE MOBIUS BAGELS
What is that thing you used to measure the malt syrup?! I need one for honey and other sticky liquids
For something that looks simple, bagels look exhausting to make lol.
Missed opportunity to name it “ bagels with babish “
Alright I’ll do it, only cause no one else has yet. Shrek 2 feast where he meets Fiona’s family
nice one, just when wanted to get some bagels with philadelfia
Pure gluten is the weapon of the future
I am also frightened by bagels. I have absolutely no idea what they are or what to think about them
I want to see an episode where you prepare dishes for Gordon Ramsay. I feel like that would be interesting.

Fermentation??? Don't tell Brad! lol
Babish buddy what happened to your signature walk in? That's not okay :/
Create the el burdigato-teen titan go
Not alot of fermentation will happen at fridge temps. Yeast do not like that shiz.
Dan is okay but he's no Brad...
I watch it not make it can't be bothered
Could you do a video with gluten free foods?
"Now dunk it in your piss."
"ToGeTher, as one"
Bagels are nasty change my mind.
I really would love to see how big they would have gotten on the counter top
Dan got the staircase beard.
New York may have the best bagels until you try a freshly baked Jerusalem bagel!
montreal makes the best bagels, gtfo.
Reminds me of a series of unfortunate events, the man with a beard and no hair and his accomplice the lady with hair and no beard
So when you put it in the fridge overnight am I to expect another two bagels to appear aswell 😅
WHAT?? SPEAK UP!
Bagels should only have one thing on them, cream cheeese
woah woah woah babish looks like the guy from home alone 4????

Montreal Bagels are the best bagels in the world. Very sad that there was no representation here. XD
Hello, Humans.     Bane: We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with myths of opportunity, and we give it back to you... the people. Gotham is yours. None shall interfere. Do as you please. Start by storming Blackgate, and freeing the oppressed! Step forward those who would serve. For and army will be raised. The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests, and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure. Courts will be convened. Spoils will be enjoyed. Blood will be shed.

Ahh I love any video where we get to see your face. It’s always a treat 😊
Bbb

If you switch their hair you get the same person

T-POSE TO ASSERT DOMINANCE
Woah, we're trending!
Damn, these are some handsome men.
Bagels and cream cheeseee🚫🧢💅🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So... Babish was totally flirting with Dan, right !?!?!!
It's weird watching Babish talking rather than cooking
I thought u said dad instead of Dan 😂
Babish being a total fangirl! Lol so adorable.
What?! Babish has a head? And a face?! I'm shocked!
Please do an episode of Basics on Croissants...
Hey baby you here the blues are coming
Andrew’s beard and Dan’s hair look like they belong on the same face...
Why are those bagels so yellow lol? Think you used wayyyy to much malt syrup btw.
i mean that vital wheat gluten could seriously hurt someone with celiac
Can you do the cheesecake from friends
Oh yeah yeah 






Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Will you two just kiss already??
I read it “Bagels with Babish” because it should be true
Does anyone know could I prep these let's say Thursday night and let them sit in the fridge until Saturday morning, or would that be too long?
you should make some of the foods from willy wonka
Both of your hair completes each other
Better chemistry between them here than other guest

Anyone else get a 5 hour long ad for The Lego Movie 2?
Binging with Bagle
Thanks babish for not trying to be that guy who teaches people stuff he doesnt know.
I don't understand bagels. I can't stand the way they taste. I love eating bread though. Oh well.
I always thought bagels were stale bread eaten by monsters
The intro is at such a weird angle
Anyone else see this as Basics With Bagels?? haha
Please can you make some lobster stuff?? I have no idea where to start
dans hair situation is the opposite babish. Babish has a beard but no hair yet dan has hair but little to no beard😂
The upward angle in the intro didn't help in making your guys' height difference less extreme.
Montreal bagels next please
Again, just hear me out. The blur on the background is jarring. Can you tone it down a notch?
5:21 :^)
nice croissants
Not used to the audio not being a voiceover haha.
Anyone kind enough to provide me the song name for the track playing at the end? Thanks in advance ✨
I've been on a pretzel making kick and been thinking of making some bagels.
Woah, this is a crazy bagel recipe. I've been baking bagels for a while now and this is really different from everything I've tried so far. I bet it tastes great.
Did you use the baking soda in the place of lye?
To save you a click, water doesn't make a difference.
those look so beautiful
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Suggestion:
How about a basics with Babish on herbs & spices? Which ones need time to give off their flavour, which ones shouldn't get too hot, which herbs are more flavourful dried rather than fresh and vice versa. I think that'd be new & interessting for cooking enthusiasts. Plus, it's easy to forget / mix-up which is which (at least for me), so replay value.
Ps: love your narration, really relaxing & dry humor
Didnt call it "Bagels with Babish." Am disappointed.
Now do Montreal bagels to compare
If I learned anything from Tony Kornheiser, it's that you have to make sure the people making your bagels have at least "TOUCHED the Old Testament."
How have you not made anything from Charlie and the chocolate factory
Dan’s food is good, but not that good. It’s only half jaw-dropping
Lilbit of dat 🗿 if ya dig

I read the title out of the corner of my eye and I thought it said Soulja boy

Anyone know the name of the background music?
Also hello freddie prinze jr I’ll be checking your channel out
Outride song today was poppin

Interesting.  My recipe does not use added gluten, and the boiling water bath has honey in it.  I also do it all by hand.  

The Great Canadian Bagel Co doesn't bother to boil the bagels, and boy can you taste the difference.
Dan is T A L L  B O I

Montrealer here coming in to tell you, our bagels are better, these are just bread.
hey Babish! Can you offer some recipes specifically bagels, no-knead bread, and foccacia that use a sourdough starter?  I have been working on my sourdough starter and it is hard to find recipes that I trust.
I hope you understand how long I have been waiting for this.
Can you please do a video on how to make the Fyre fest cheese sandwich?
No lye, it is not a real bagel

Binging with daddy
I have a recipe for Irish soda bread. I used to love making it back when I had counter space. If I send it to you will you make it on the show?
Why is the sound of the food processor so satisfying
Hey look, there's no episode number on this one.
1:35 is where the recipe starts.
What’s the music used for the last half of the video?? I KNOW I’ve listened to it before but I can’t remember at all what it is. And Shazam wasn’t helpful for me.
This title made me think someone made a music video about bagels.
If it ain’t a New York bagel, fuhgeddaboudit!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is so basic lmao
The Bromance is real.
Best bagel is from Montreal
The crossover we all wanted

They kind of remind me of, the Man with a Beard but No Hair and the Woman with Hair but No Beard, when they're together.
The bagels made babies when they went in the fridge.
0:14 i want somebody to look at me the way dan looks at babish loool 💀

They have the same head. One is just flipped over.
you kinda look like Ryan Reynolds lol
Binging with Bagels
Hey Babish!  Thanks to you, my endeavors of cooking in college are going great :) Can you do a video on the different kinds of cuts, like julienne, chiffonade, etc.?  Looking forward to more videos that feed the tummy and the eyes haha 😆
Babish has some of the best collaborations.
Could you, out of sheer curiosity, try same recipe except with added butter in the dough (and probably some flour to even it out). In Finnish bagel is "vesirinkeli", but there's another one that looks quite the same, except it's usually bit firmer/harder called "voirinkeli".. which at least on short googling is just bagel, but with addded butter in the dough. And as everyone knows by now, adding butter makes everything better.. :p 
To be fair they are two different products, the bagel like is usually cut in half&eaten with fillings while the buttery one is eaten as is.. maybe as side for coffee or tea. IIRC the buttery one may even be flavored with vanilla etc. as it's expected to serve as is.
I just got a 5 hour ad for the lego movie
I make bagels and other bread at work and it can be frustrating but I like it
leggo my bagel
Please get J. Kenji Lopez-Alt on the show!!!!
I wonder what Dan and Andrew did for the day and 2 hours of downtime they had...

*Bingeing with Babish. Your channel name is spelled wrong. Just fyi.
I'm mad you didn't call this bagels with babish
This are pretty nice.
How tall is Babby?
Bagels are just BASIC donuts
Nice 5 hour add
7:02 water falls
What is happening when after you boil it instead baking you fry it in oil. Is that will make it become a Donut ?
Babish, you have a mysterious way of releasing videos about a topic I've recently become interested in. It's happened a few times now.
But for real, I've been reading up on bagels for the past week now, and here you come with a bagel video. Same thing happened with the old chicken wing video, the cinnamon rolls, the tonkotsu ramen and the okonomiyaki. It's starting to get a bit creepy.  WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
If you slap Dan's head hard enough from the top, you'd get Babish.
Trending, nice!
Thats 37 bobish
There were 6 bagels before you put em in the fridge, 8 when you put em out, did they make babies overnight ?
Does anyone know the name of the song used in the intro of the video?
I would date you so hard.
I love how even if Babish already knew some of that stuff, he didn’t try to flaunt and let dan teach
Thank you Babish very cool!
Yeah anybody that lives in any of the 5 boroughs, don’t even bother with this episode lmao
Basics with the Babish Brothers
Babish the bagel boss
Wait, people actually eat bagels? I thought they were just the hypeman for donuts
How did they stake up to your typical New York Bagel?
Can you cook meth from breaking bad please
I work in the food court at Costco, and the dough balls we use for our pizzas get made in-house every day (not necessarily on-site; I'm not sure where they get made, but they're made by Costco and delivered fresh to the warehouse each day. Maybe they make them in the bakery? I don't..I don't know) say "Made with New York water" on the boxes. So maybe they're made in New York...is as far as I got in wondering about what that meant.

Until just now.

So thanks for that. :P
This episode is so chill.
Please make all the awesome breakfast food from you’re the worst... oh and trash juice!
Ahem...Bagels with Babish
So, do all the good food yt channel guys have the same outfit?

Man now I’m hungry
The bromance is real
Boiling then baking bagels on Basics with Babish.
Mmm bagels

Oh yeah yeah
My sister and I just swooned. 💕
babish's channel is starting to honestly lack..it started off with awesome creations and now its seriously down hilling
I got a commercial for Natrel bagel spreads. Not that I'd use them with Babish's infinite knowledge but this seems like too much of a coincidence (if you choose to believe me).
Dan has the hair, Babish has the beard
who is dan?
Want to start a garden? I will show you how to convert a piece of lawn into no maintenance sustainable garden, to grow your own food to use to cook with!
I am going to start a show called Can I Eat You Dan?
I went to the Culinary Institute of America, and during my time there they never made REAL bagels. The ones they made in classes were basically rolls with a hole. Barely any chew, no softness, dry, crusty. Their bagels reminded me of the ones from Dunkin Donuts, it was honestly so embarrassing
Do you absolutely need a food processor to mix the dough? Is there an alternative method?
The sexual tension was real
Bagels with Babish binging
bagels with babby
That's a skinny bagle
Does anyone else want to see Babish make any foods from a book series? Like ambrosia squares from Percy Jackson? Or blue coke?
U look so smol
I made these today (first day prep) and the dough was soooooooo sticky, I absolutely had to use more flour to even touch the dough. Hope they turn out okay tomorrow.
Dan is the hair version of you
Basic Bagels with Babish!
King cake if you please
No homo but your voice is soothing.
I love Dan.

Do bagels
Bagels with Babish hahaha
:((( I'm sorry but those are disappointing looking bagels :((((( are there other methods or ratios you can do? maybe revisit bagels in a later ep? even flat bagels vs regular? 
I kinda want to try making them myself, but I don't think anything will beat a local bagel shop. 
Boston water is def different than NYC (it's relatively hard water).
Idk man
When are you getting a tattoo of tiny whisk
You need to be on hot ones
Great choice of music.
Please do ceviche
Cool guest and recipe, but the changes to your aesthetic format in the video were bad. The audio was difficult to hear and I really missed the voice-over format. The shot of your faces in front of the pans on the wall was poorly set up because the brighter shines on the metal caused some eyestrain, and the text overlay for the recipes amounts was distracting and didn`t look good. Your normal format is clean, elegant, and effective. Still a fan, just letting you know! ^^
I guess new york bagel are better if made at home because there not made by hand often. On the other hand good luck recreating montreal bagel at home. It's doable it's just not worth it tough.
This is SO complicated. aren't Marraqueta easier? 
I do not understand the Bagel culture in north america.
bagels with babish

Babish you should start a new series where you bring in other youtubers and challenge them to a cook off. Call it battle with babish
You should do Falafel
Dang at least make the same amount before and after the cut, 6 turned into 8
I read this as basics with bagels
Do you have a proofer?
Do hummus!
MINI PIZZAS?
When the dough comes out of the blender it looks like a face
It's kind of weird that this video doesn't have a voice-over
High heels.
Where are all the small youtubers? Let's all gain together!
Music please.
New York Bagels the best?.... Go to Montreal, fellas!!
Maybe this is how I will finally get the New York bagels I crave while living in London...
Cook actual meth
All I can think about is the fact that they look the same except their hair is switched
I’m curious now if Vegemite or Marmite could work instead of the malt syrup, although might want to omit the kosher salt as either of those tend to have a high enough salt content on their own
Hey Babish!  Thanks to you, my endeavors of cooking in college are going great :) Can you do a video on the different kinds of cuts, like julienne, chiffonade, etc.?  Or maybe what was a meal that you yourself cooked most often?  Looking forward to more videos that feed both the eyes, mouth - and tummy 😆
Yeah, "pro".
Bagels with banish
Wait how tall is babish
Is this Basics With Babish... or Basics With Dan

Curing food
From personal experience, hard water always makes better tasting bread and beer. My current location has well water and is super soft and makes bread taste like shit and beer undrinkable. The water doesn't taste bad at all and can be used for drinking, baking, cooking. Just not yeast or sour dough products.

Drown them in cream cheese
MAKE STUFF FROM FOOD WARS THE ANIME, I PROMISE ITS AMAZING
Interesting!  I've always preferred egg bagels because they are a bit less chewy (slightly more "bready" texture) but they've gotten hard to find these days where I live.  Maybe I should just try looking for punch bagels.
Julian solomita is triggered at 2 minutes
That water spill at 7:03
I don't know why but I got a five hour ad of a single chorus from a song from the Lego movie 2 before this video even started. What.
when my family says butter and salt are unhealthy and shouldn't be consumed i think of babish and how he is seemingly healthy, i tried telling them about you, but because you use kosher salt they assume you jewish and cant be trusted.
Babish is stepping all over Dan's toes, even tho he's the host he should let Dan lead. It should be like America's Test Kitchen format but with their heads left out of the shot
Salty donuts
Hey Andrew(a.k.a babish) speaking of sirens why dont you do an episode where you make cinnabar volcano burgers from pokemon gold,silver and crystal and feed your local fire Department or fire station! Show some appreciation for your local heroes. F.Y.I im a volunteer firefighter thats why i suggested it.
I have been a fan of this channel for awhile. I have considered going into the culinary career. These videos have allowed me to learn more recipes and techniques. I'm excited to check out Dan's channel because of my extreme interest into the science side of food :)
Oh no no
Why isn't this episode called "Bagels with Babish" ?
Babish can I come over to your place?
Seems a snake is eating dan
That lip bite tho, lol 0:14
He looks like you but with hair and no beard while you have a beard and no hair
Make the basics channel about true basics. The average home cook is never going to make their own bagels

If they do that dance from dragon ball Z and merge they have a beard and hair at the same time
Boston wahtah
Pretentious sob
Screw you guys and your NY or Montréal bagels. My local Jewish deli makes the best bagels.
It’s funny looking at them together cause their faces look super similar but the hair is flipped babish with dans hair is too powerful and Dan with babish’s beard is the same
Wow, insanely small world, but I had no idea that What's Eating Dan was filmed at America's Test Kitchen in the Design Building in Boston – I used to work in that exact building lmao. Filming for them would have been a dream job!
My Dan?
where is the spice
If you ever make another giant food thing or food challenge do a colaberation  with Mattstonie, AKA the guy who took down the giant burrito in less then 2 minutes
Song name?
so did y’all kiss after?
Nice video enjoyed it
was it just me or did our man Dan have a little trouble letting Babish have some tasks too lol
Awesome you did bagels on basics. When I'm so broke I have to make something from scratch I make bagels. It's great that they don't need any kind of fat. I can make these when I'm out of oil, lard and butter.
There is no reason for this video to exist
NOW KISS
There is an episode of Jimmy Neutron called MaternoTron Knows Best where Jimmy's overworked and underappreciated mother bakes some strange meals for her son and husband, which they don't even eat, one of which involves mashed potatoes shaped like Albert Einstein.
Indiana jones has abit of food u can try to make
do doughnuts

I made bagels this morning. It was mixed results. I had two issues right up front. I couldn’t find any malt syrup in town so I used molasses (internet said I could substitute). I don’t have a food processor so I used a Ninja which started to smoke/burn up during the mixing :(  Everything else went ok after that. The bagels came out darker and they were very chewy and had a good flavor. I tried a few different toppings. Salt, plain, and Everything Bagel from Trader Joe’s. I wish I just left them plain because I think that tasted best. 

Question: can I just knead the bread since I lack a food processor?
all these american measurements that are used basically no where else in the world are making this too hard to watch.
Sploosh from the movie Holes
Are they brothers? They look very similar
yeaaaaaah. no. this might be basic for you not but why would i take two days to get bagels
Babish and Babish with hair afraid of his mouth!!!
Why not in weight measurements though?
Anyone else notice how after they let the bagels sit in the fridge, it went from 6 bagels to 8...? HMM
I sense a bit of movie magic at 6:00 it went from 6 to 8 bagels
Why does he change his voice when his face is not on camera?
The man with a beard and no hair and the other man with hair and no beard.
bring back brad and babish!!!!
Do the Mississippi Queen
thats hooooot
dan looks like someone took babbish and flipped him over
First time we’ve ever heard that food processor
Did anyone else get the Gillette ad at the end?
I’ve never eaten a bagel. What’s it like?
Nice recipe, but they should’ve boiled them in piss and toilet water- that’d be a true New York bagel.
Bears. Beets. Babish and Bagels.
Went and watched Dan's video on Chocolate Chip Cookies before watching this video, and wow, instantly subscribed when it was over. How have I gone so long without knowing about his channel??? Also his audio sounded much clearer than yours (besides your voice overs, which are always good) so maybe shoot him a message asking him how he achieves such nice audio.
yum
Is nobody gonna mention how much Dan bit his lips while looking at Babish?
Bagels?
Who else goes to Dunkin’ Donuts for a bagel and you ask for the bagel to be toasted or cut and they don’t do neither. Life sucks
Babish should do chopped.
Gluten ?
Being short with Babish.
Babish, is he tall or are you just short?
Baby babish
Hello! I'm an American living in Korea, a land full of amazing food  - but unfortunately lacking on the bread end of things.  This video was my final push to finally make some bagels myself since I can't find them here. Weirdly enough, hamburger and hot dog buns are impossible to find here as well, so a future video on buns would be very helpful :)   

It would also be awesome if you delved into some Korean food!  There are some really amazing dishes here that I think a lot of viewers would enjoy being introduced to.  In the beginning of the Adventure Time episode "Apple Thief," Jake prepares a Korean meal of bibimbap, soy bean paste soup, fried shrimp (could be interpreted as seafood pancakes, which are  incredible) and a grilled fish which may be interpreted as mackerel.   While these are just a few of many great dishes, it could be a fun way to connect with audiences!
This intro makes me wanna break into a fresh loaf of ciabatta with fresh, homemade butter.
How is this trending and not Hot Ones with Gordon Ramsey?  It's got 14 million views in 4 days.  Must be the foul language.
Am i the only one who thinks this episode doesn't feel like a normal one?
oy vey
is that babish with hair-
The title looks like a song
The audio is terrible.  This makes me sad.
What about if I wanted to make an egg bagel?
Didn't like it not the normal

Yet another crossover with a FoodTube bae? Babby, you spoil us.
Dan is hot.
as one
"What's Eating Dan:" or "What's Eating, Dan:" cause I feel like I should be fearful of what Dan's got in the the kitchen... :/

Any subs for wheat gluten and malt syrup? Lol I want these now, not after an amazon delivery. They look so amazing and I just bought an everything mix from Trader Joe’s.
Can you do donuts? Please? 🍩
babish you know mat pat right from gametheory well he needs your help he just loss almost 2 million bucks and 50 other people had this happen to I am trying to help please text mat to help
Someone please tell me where I can get that syringe at 2:36.
How tall is babish?
Babbish traded his height for the beard.
Is the gluten gluten-free?
i’m pretty disappointing you didn’t call this one “bagels with babish”
Back in the 70's, when I was little, my grandma would fly to see us in North Dakota all of the way from New Jersey. She would bring a BIG BIG bag of bagels from a local Jewish deli. All the greats: egg, pumpernickel, sesame seed, and poppy seed. We did not have bagels in North Dakota back then, so having these fantastic bagels flown out within 24 hours or so of being baked out east...well, it was a rare treat. Plus, I got to see grandma!
i still dont know the difference between kosher salt and salt
Not convinced that making bagels at home will end up with something worth the effort. Obviously this is Babish and its all about doing it from scratch but things like this, puff pastry and ketchup he has explicitly said aren't worth the result is not worth the effort and his lack of a significant positive reaction to the homemade bagels doesn't lead me to believe its worth it. I come here for the recipes, but I also want his opinion on how the recipe came out. He's usually not afraid of deciding if the end result was worth the effort and sharing his opinion.
I love both of you guys, but I have a burning questison.  Why does everyone call the process of letting the flour and water rest autolyse and pronounce it "auto-lease"?  Autolyse is a verb, not a noun, and is pronounced "auto-lies".  (Look it up in any dictionary ever.)  The noun is autolysis ("awe-TALL-iss-iss", like analysis).  So, you could say, "The process of letting the flour and water rest is called autolysis."  OR:  "Leave the water and flour to autolyse."  BUT NOT:  "The process is called autolyse."  (Think of analyze and analysis.  You'd never say, "The process of looking into the facts is called analyze."  It's not.  It's called analysis.)  Clearly "autolyse" (both the word and its incorrect pronunciation) have penetrated everywhere from Cooks Illustrated to Serious Eats to King Arthur Flour's website, and I've heard it on every big name youtube food channel like Babish, Hot Thai Kitchen, Chef Steps, etc., but it's just wrong.

End rant.  Seriously though, great videos and great recipes!  I always appreciate the analyze you guys put into them!
Why am I watching this? I don’t even like bagels lol
For a food that I had thought was boring and uninspired, this video gave me a new respect for Bagels.
Altitude also plays into bagels, or so I've found. I'm originally from Bozeman, MT and thought bagels were always a dense, rigid roll. Until I visited Boston and had the most amazing bagels in my life. (Have not been to New York yet.) Apparently, like all breads, the higher you go the more dense your dough ends up due to air pressure. So not everyone will be able to make bagels of the texture in this video if you live in the mountains. But they should still taste pretty good with some cream cheese.
Does Babish have a cookbook yet?
I bet Babish eats nothing but hot pockets off camera
That’s the strangest looking bagel I’ve ever seen
Yummy basics with bagels
I see a missed opportunity when you did not sprinkle anything on the dough before you rolled it. Maybe some real parmegianno, some herbs, some pesto or whatnot. I get you were doing the original but that would be delicious.
Can you pls make the fig dessert from the "Simply Irresistible" movie?
Does your girlfriend call you babie 🤔🤔🤔
To get my bagels, i go to a little corner store that has great bagels




Tim hortons
why does it say you have 4 new videos when there's only one?   LIAR!!!
Spoilers. His video says no the water made no difference
I saw that sorry excuse of an Ad that Gillette released. Kinda left a bad taste coming in here, but none the less I’ll watch and enjoy my daily Babish
Jesus Christ a five hour Lego movie 2 ad with the word this song is gonna get stuck in your head on loop for 5 hours if this ain't genius marketing I don't know what is

Hi I’m AirWhit  I like bagels
Hey, uh, I don’t know if you take suggestions but I’ve tried making buttermilk fried chicken, and while the chicken was moist, the skin did not stick and taste nothing but flour. If you could somehow help me, even if it’s simple tips, that would be appreciated greatly! Idk if you’d dedicate an episode to it but if you do, uhm, you’re welcome? Lol
Basically babish’s bagels. bagels with babish?
Black apron, blue button up, black frames, did you guys mean to dress alike or is this the youtube chef uniform now?
I’m gluten intolerant so ima just eat some vital wheat gluten and take a nap.
A father and son make some bagels. I’ll let you guess who’s who.
Fitz: Yeah guys I’ll be right there!!! I’m binging with babish right now!!
Dope collab!! You are a good host for just letting him do his thing!👍
This makes my Jewish blood very happy
Not so basic “basics with babish” we love it
I...I don't like this only Brad is allowed to be taller than you in the kitchen...
Why do you always use kosher salt?
Why am I watching this at midnight?
So boring. I'll rather drive to McDonalds than learn this complicated recipe.
have my children babyish
👁️👄👁️
Why no closeup of the difference between the two? :(
When are you gonna make tossed salads and scramby eggs?
Nice video 👍👍👍 help my channel 🙏🙏🙏 last video help 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😍😍😗😗😗
how do i make the plain bagel's superior cousin, the egg bagel? add egg yolks?
What’s the end song ??
I'm sorry. But the New York method of bagels is just incorrect. New York bagels are small, dense, and worst of all soft like you would find in a container of Thomas' In Jersey they are fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. No soft bagels here.
KRUSTY KRAB PIZZA
Vigina
Babish is basic
Any reason why you're not using fresh yeast?
Soooo.... Fucked those bagels before the shoot?
Kirby's Superspicy Curry would be a great one to make!
just ...
"It's my kitchen, so I gotta establish dominance."
I do the same thing Babish.
That crunch from the bagel is just perfect.
anyone else think he should do a series about cleaning equipment?
Andrews got a better beard. Dan has better hair (by default)
I like the live format! I think it serves the guest better. It would be better if you had separate mics clipped to your collars so that the voices could be isolated from the kitchen sounds in the mix... The voice audio sounded very quiet.
Didn't know bagels where so time consuming.
Babish and Bagels - Your new morning show, coming soon! (Breakfast not included terms and conditions apply)
Don't ask me why but until they cut into it I thought they were making doughnuts
Love both of you guys.
I love this collaboration.  Dan is just about the only person from Cook's Illustrated or America's Test Kitchen that I can put up with and seeing him with Andrew is is pretty cool.  It's also interesting to watch Dan actually do a little bit of kitchen work which is something that's pretty rare to actually get to see on his show.
I never ate bagels
the guest is such a bore...
Why do you always use kosher salt? Is there a flavor or cooking difference or is it for preference?
make a nugget biscuit with mash potatoes and barbecue sauce
Make Montreal bagels. NY bagels are hot garbage.
Am I the only one who like his own comment when there's just one person who liked it because you don't want anyone to think that this like is yours?
Celiac disease have entered the chat
There was this funny comment a while back, about what would the name of an advanced course with babish be. It was B__ with Babish. Does anybody remember lmao.
assemble the team, BBBB, basics with bagels,
wait, no, shit . . .i meant basics with babish, and then bagels?

you get the point
I left a video essay to scope this out! Love your work Dan! Andrew- keep that voice silky as your beard.
Love all your videos, but especially when you remake foods from film and television. Might I recommend expanding into foods from video games? Lots of good content there. Cheers!
I'm so glad you & Dan did a crossover episode. America's Test Kitchen has such informative videos, & is such a great source for recipes/ general knowledge. It always make me a little sad how few subs they have....
Thanks gentlemen👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
That amount of gluten is enough to wipe out California
Love your content and your style chef! Great video!
Not first!!!!
I’ll fins a way to mess this up
Should have called it bagels with babish
YYEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
Was that butter on the bagel? Cold, unmelted butter?
If you're ever in Ottawa, there's a legendary shop called Kettelman's that does incredible Montreal-style bagels. I never want store-bought bagels again after trying those.
Toss me a bagel
I want Babish to team up with Action Bronson!
Don't trust recopies that don't come straight from the horses mouth.   Can we get a real binging with babby episode?
Why are all of Babish's guest cute ?

As someone from Bucharest, Romania, I've never had a good bagel. Can anyone tell me why they're so craved? To me, this whole process seems like way too much effort for way too little, but I'm probably wrong.
pizza mozzarella pizza mozzarella pizza mozzarella pizza mozzarella pizza mozzarella pizza mozzarella
Bagels are great

And I haven't had many
You've got to do an episode with life of boris.
You sound like you have a cold. You good?
THAT CRUNCH at the end!
i'd recommend the bagel that has a hole in the middle
I made bagels once and they were a lot of work, but they tasted really good.  They just didn't taste that much better than my local bagel shop when they had just put out fresh bagels, so I have not made them since.
My inner New Yorker is crying tears of joy.
Well I will say that I understand your choice to employ 'What's Eating Dan?' but you're better solo. I enjoy your voice-over humor and sarcasm. Other than that, great video, I love sesame bagels, since you asked. Keep up the sick content Babish!
Dan from america's test kitchen! Cool
Can you make milk bread
No lye? Or is that for pretzels?
Oh no Babish...  Don't "cheers"  food ffs
Love it Babish. can you do an episode how to make Kibbeh? its a ground meat Syrian food wrapped in buckwheat
Yep those sure are bagels
Babbish you’re too critical about yourself everyone learns at their own pace you’re doing a great job😃
Bagels
did you know that a lot of people that say they can't have gluten are actually just allergic to wheat?
As a  bageler from NJ I am very confused by this wonkey ass bagel making process did. Never have I seen a bagel that yellow outside of like an egg bagel or a cheddar bagel. This whole video had me so confused. Why in gods name did you put sugar and baking soda in the water???
Anyone know where I would go to get malt syrup and vital wheat gluten? Is there any substitute for those items? Like can I just use yeast instead of yeast and wheat gluten and can I just use sugar or honey instead of malt syrup?

Just recently tried Bagels for the first time, absolutely in love with them and now I can make them myself.




Thank you, Babish. Keep it up




Greets.
Says it was released 13 minutes ago

I look at the comments and see people with comments posted 30+ minutes ago
You alright there YouTube
Thanks for giving Dan the shoutout he deserves--I'm not a huge fan of "What's Eating Dan?" but his articles and foreword in Cook's Magazine are exceptionally well done.
Babish the UN is sending Peace Keepers for global terrorism... having the ability to kill half of NYC 
If you see men in blue berets run
You should do the Peruvian puff pepper chilli from drake and josh 😩
oh boy, bagels are a lot more complicated to do than I originally expected, shows what I know
Montreal Bagels!!!
You know how they have Drunk History? I'd love a Drunk BWB where you go through how to do everything but completely blasted
This is the collab i didn't know i needed. The man with all the info
Binging with Bagels 😁
Babish you the man 👨🏻
Looks so good
Love it! ❤
I don’t understand the point in premieres??
I'd recommend putting the baking soda in the water before it comes to a boil. I once dumped baking soda into boiling water, and that was the day I learned how to take apart my oven door to clean baking soda residue off of all of the layers of glass inside.
Tbh, those 5 seconda intro music from basic with babish got me to a feeling of good homemade cooking and family togetherness 😅😥😣, (just my opinion!!)
Dan's hair and no beard is just Babish's beard and no hair in reverse
Ive heard  that if I arrive early I get a heart

Plz I'm desperate
Nop, Montreal's Bagels are miles away from the competition.
Ah, the bagel. The bane of everyone on a diet. Too fattening to be anything but a cheat food, at which point you might as well stop messing around and get an actual doughnut.
Babish, you gotta mic yourself and guests if you're doing a voice over after.

That said, I love Dan and you, so this was great.
Please do an episode of english muffins from "Importance of Being Earnest" 💕
Please do an episode on Drop Dead Fred and make a mud pie (show accurate and edible) and "romantic" salad
Steve1989 MRE special please?
Bagels and donuts: Round food for every mood!
You could call it “baking with babish”
Binging with bagels
Please make curry from The Hundred Foot Journey.
Is this a crossover episode
U guys should make a show called 2 cucks
i love it
💥💥❤️❤️🌸⚡️🌼  🌟  ⚡️💜💜💜 🌼  🌟 ⚡️🌼  🌟🌸💙💙💥💥 Based on love alone. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die in our place. Then on the third day rose Him  from the dead.

Now, though Jesus Christ alone. God has granted us the free gift of eternal life. He will save and heal you, if you ask Him.
Montreal bagels are the true bagels 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
The best bagels are from new york?!?!?!? As someone from montreal, I spit on your bagels!!!!!
Best bagels are from New York? You've lost my respect Babbi. Everyone knows Montreal is where it's at.
That gluten could kill half of New York, Because the people of New York are insane.
Binging with Babish? more like Binging with a manlet
Babish, you should try making jelly donuts that look like Japanese rice balls, in honor of the infamous localization in the 4Kids dub of "Pokemon."
Worlds best bagels come from MONTRÉAL, not NY. Come at me.
Aren’t bagels just a messed up doughnut
You should do Eliot’s unforgettable sandwich from Leverage’s The Office Job! He goes right into how he makes it in the episode and it sounds amazing
Make a video making a cake of Danny Devito while having Danny Devito in the show and called
Basic With Babish:
Cake
WHOA! he does the cooks illustrated videos? I love that instagram page!
Ok, big request: the sushi from Isle of Dogs

Babish, do you have a cookbook out?

Bagels are donuts but healthier
Got to be honest those bagels don't look very new York . Probably just my area . It's not Boston or brooklyn who has the best . It's long island!
instructions not clear, i fell asleep when i was eating it
Im crying! I've always wanted to try creme de la creme a la Edgar
Okay but did you end up meeting Tomas O'Malley after waking up?
Won't you be a culinary badass and make us "The Worst Pies"/ Mrs. Lovett's Meat Pies from Sweeney Todd please?. Surely there's some of us Hannibal fans who want both versions of the famous/infamous dish for Johnny Depp's musical murder movie.
I remember when I was little watching this scene thinking how good this must taste
When the mouse eats better food than you
Him eating like a mouse was adorable
You should make fire flakes from Last Air Bender!
For the next video you should try making “raspberry chocolate strudel doodles” from Chowder
Are you up for making white cake from "Dejango unchained?"

Make a King size ultra Krabby supreme with the works double batter fried on a stick from Spongebob!

LOVE THAT YOU DID THIS VIDEO!!!🥰😍🥰 Always wanted cremé de la cremé a la edgar
"Pastry Chef Attempts to Make Gourmet Ritz Crackers"
I forgot about how much I love that movie lol
This made me so happy
At first they didn't look like pacifiers to me ,if you know what I mean 😂😂
Oml..someone who knows the movie! I freaking love that movie since I watched it when I was 7 years old...damn It's been a long time since that movie was released.. Time does past fast doesn't it. 😃
I'm beginning to think he didn't actually add barbituous sleeping aids.
I just had a nostalgic orgasm
I've been waiting for this since 1995.
Tiana’s beignet’s from Princess and the Frog!
I would love to see the Herring Pot Pie from Kikki’s delivery service! It’s such a beautiful scene where she uses the old brick oven, and it breaks my heart when the granddaughter doesn’t appreciate it. Also the dish looks so intricate and beautiful while still maintaining a rustic feel. I think you could do something lovely with it!
ive been cooking for 15 years now and ive yet to come across a family recipe that doesnt have sleeping pills as the secret ingredient... now excuse me i just had breakfast and i need to take a 5 hour nap
THANK YOU!!! Thank you so much. Since I was small, I had always wanted to try this for soooo long

Its time for the Pesca-pescatarian from Silicon Valley
If my family decides to be good for Christmas they will get this. Without the sleeping pills.
Instruction unclear, my cat got stolen somehow...

You should make the Mississippi Queen drink from Regular Show for your next video
Do Kiki delivery service porridge, Ramen and the Bento Boxes.
😍😍😍 Also, I think sweetening it with honey would make it taste even better. Hot milk and honey is always a delicious win! 🙌🏻
This is the quality content I’ve been searching for
I watched The Aristocats growing up, one of my favorites. Love this!
The musicality (if that's a word) is fantastic. Good job, Sir
That looked soooo good to me as a kid. I have a weird fascination with cartoon food I think because the bugs in the Lion King also looked delicious.
As a kid, crème de la crème à la Edgar looked so satisfying
You talked about the oven for 10-15 minutes until you were nice and brown?
FINALLY A RECIPE FOR CREME DE LA CREME A LA EDGAR. THANK YOU <3
Lois’s is leftover parfait from Malcolm in the Middle? 
Thank you for working the Aristocats in. It’s my favorite movie and I love this recipe.
I’m so happy you made this!! I can’t tell you how delicious this looked in the movie, as a child I was so jealous I couldn’t try it!
you should make Danish Butter Cookies, like the ones that come from Gramma’s sewing tin 😅
Out of all the recipes in films, THIS IS THE LAST ONE I WOULD EXPECT BABISH TO MAKE
Benson's Chicken Wing Chili from Regular Show!

Babish I love you, this is straight up one of those foods I remember wanting to eat as a kid...
The Aristocats is lit

Smoothie from T Bo from iCarly or spaghetti tacos

Aw, this video's recipe selection was plucked straight out of my childhood dreams. 
Creme de la creme always looked so delicious! (Sans tranquilizers...)
OH MY GOD, I audibly gasped.

I am so obsessed with this movie and this made my morning shine a little brighter. Amazing, finally got to see such an EXQUISITE, 5 star, Michelin worthy food. 😫😂
Can you make the Pork Buns from Sleeping Dogs? (I guess Pork Buns in general.)
Fun fact: my mum wanted to name my younger brother Edgar. Unfortunately for her, I was five years old and a proper Aristocats fan - I quite firmly vetoed MY baby brother being named after a CAT MURDERING VILLAIN. There are times that call for tact and diplomacy, but defending my unborn baby brother from such a heinous fate was not one of them. Needless to say, my parents saw reason and gave the child a non-villain name. Instead he got my grandfather's five-syllable [ETA: four syllables, sorry] Middle Eastern name. We live in Sweden. He usually goes by his very Western sounding nickname instead 😅

I mean, at least I didn't have to grow up with an evil butler brother, right? Totally worth it.
Yea, sure, making a giant Ritz biscuit is your job XD

Now I feel like watching the Aristocats again, never knew that scene could be a real recipe :-O
Oh wow. I used to love Aristocats
I never knew what it meant so I used to call it "Astro Cats"
omg thank you i didnt even have to ask and you have blessed me with this amazing recipe!!!
I'm so going to make this at my next tea party! This was one of my favorite movies when growing up. Thank you so much.
Yo, Babish. Could you cover Silver's stew from Treasure Planet?
Didn’t know where to message you lol but would love to see some lord of the rings stuff like elf bread or rabbit stew. Love the channel man!
Still waiting for some Studio Ghibli Food! 🤤🤤🤤
This looks so good.. thanks for making this video.
Oh yeah yeah

Hot Vanilla is Vanilla Ice's evil twin.
I love the Aristocats, it's one of my all time favorite movies.
This. This is the best one.
I'd like to see you make a drink, like the Kelp Shake from SpongeBob :)
Video suggestion! Fish fingers and custard from Doctor Who - would be great to see you do real and improved versions :)
“THIS IS MY JOB!” - Babish scrams as milk drips from him beard.

You’ve made my childhood dreams come true 😭 ♥️
Eating the body of christ

Gone sexual
This scene was in back of my mind ever since I watched it.
I usually like to watch the whole ad before a video but i swear to god i got a 300 minute ad before this one...
OMG
I LOVED THIS MOVIE!

Aristocats was classic
Can you make the addictive candy from the episode of Jimmy Neutron called Krunch Time?
Idea for you Babish:
Get your head tattooed to look like hair.
I liked the recipes and your sense of humor!! Well done!!!
This video makes me so happpyyy (only because its theme)
Mouse like nibbles
Binging with Babish saved me from hunger!

IVE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THIS WAS .. THANK YOUUUUUUUU 😍😍😍😍
Make tater tots from venom
Burgers from pulp fiction 
Tempura from smash bros
YES I always thought this looked great 😂
Hot vanilla sounds way better than hot chocolate, what is wrong with you? How is hot vanilla not already a thing?
Hey Andrew, could you make my wife love me again?
Babish you goddamn culinary genius! I knew there was a reason why I became one of your many subscribers.
I tried the hot vanilla. We should rename it Christmas milk
You should make the banana cake at the begging of donkey Kong tropical freeze
Was anyone waiting for him to pass out like they did in the movie? Just me? Ok.
I remember as a kid I always wanted to try this because it looked so satisfying.
Hey there. I have recently binged the HELL out of your channel. I am in absolute love with your work thank you for so much advice and general entertainment!
I have a question and well I saw you did Zelda Breath of the wild. I wonder if you can do one of the meals from Monster Hunter World?
I loved the Aristocats so much as a kid, I really couldn't help but grin through the whole video
Why is you voice so relaxing. I wanna to listen to your videos while I fall asleep 😴 💤
The Aristocats🤗!?! Wow you really went back in time for this one. I appreciate it and all your other videos too. Love this channel! The edit was awesome too. 😂💚
I love this channel. I saw you on a late show once and I can't recall which one but I feel like I remember you not being there specifically to promote this channel. You just happened to mention it and I subbed. Wish I could remember. If you see this, please refresh my memory.
Do a remake of Netflix’s “Fyre Festival Documentary” sandwich 😂😂
Legit only clicked on this after hearing the title in Aristocats  after all those years lmaoooooooo so awesomeeeeeeee. Still quote that movie till this day lmfaooo
Pudding Cups from Dragon Ball Super. Babish please ive been commenting for so long i just want a Dragon Ball reference
Can I just say, thank you for making real food. And I mean, real food. As much as I love Buzz-feed’s Tasty, I can’t stand how they manage to make food so confusing and unnecessarily complicated. Why are you wrapping a hollowed out block of cheese with stuffing in the middle, in bacon and puff pastry, only to put it inside a whole fucking turkey?! 
So, thank you Babish, for making, real food.
Pizza, stuffed in a turkey, the whole thing deep fried then dipped in chocolate! 
-Cloudy with a chance of meatballs
You should make the purple Ube cake from Steven Universe..... also basically anything from Studio Ghibli movies
Yo your editing is dope and I'm glad you spend energy on it. Makes your content special.
You need to do spaghetti tacos from ICarly please
“I don’t want to do this; it’s my JOB!”

You should make the Ribwich from the Simpsons
I fuvking love you, I always wanted to eat that damn thing ever since I watched the Aristocats!

You should make the Broodwich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
This makes me so happy. Such an obscure food reference!
Hey Babish. Lomg time fan, forst time caller. think it would be pretty wicked if you tackled a Monster Hunter World meal order. Any of these plates are epic.

MY DREAM CAME TRUE I CAN FINALLY MAKE CREME DE LA CREME A LA EDGAR THANK YOU!!!!
that onion-peanuts concoction SpongeBob makes in S2E2 but make it edible lmao
Not sure that Edgar served his Crème de la Crème as warm as you had yours. Cat tongues are sensitive to heat, so they would have to consumed it at room temp, or else the kitties would've hissed in disgust and the roofies would fail.
OMG YES! I always thought this looked so delicious!
Hey babish!
Can you make the sumbitches from himym season 9?
Missed opportunity to fall asleep at the end of the video from the sleeping pills. I've always wanted to eat this, looked delicious. Although disagree about processed-tasting oils, yucko. Nice work either way!
Not sure why but I always imagined it as savory instead of  sweet.
I read the title as "The Aristocrats", and thought: "I'm not sure I'd want to eat anything from THAT movie."
hello i think it would be amazing if you made some of the meals from ponyo! they always look so good
please
(we out here being polite)
Please, can you do the soup from Ratatouille?
3:50 just vanilla earlier add some sketchy pills..... ok
Everytime I watched the aristocats I wanted to taste this milk and now my dreams come true
"Just a few dunks."
Thank you for making this! Hits me right in the nostalgia, I’ll give you that. As a kid, I loved the movie, specifically this little ASMR-ish scene of preparing crème de la crème à la Edgar.
I spot four roses small batch in the background 🥃
Do victory drink from Regular Show
Please make more foods from Disney movies!!! 
Here’s some suggestions: 

Pie from Snow White 
Birthday Cake from Sleeping Beauty 
Biscuits from Pocahontas 
Slugs from Lion King 
Pea Soup from Rescuers Down Under
Pretty sure that was just a Digestive Biscuit, not a Ritz.

Thank you so much for making this one! It really put a smile on my face.
Ive watched Aristocats so many times. Finally this episode ive waited so long
You should recreate iconic foods from Disneyland!
Now do oeufs a la Jenny avec cocoa krispies from Oliver and Company.
Can you make the foods from Harry Potter or the Lord of the rings
I like how he says like "Let them get to know each other"
It reminds me of my guy Bob Ross
Had to sub after seeing this brought back so many memories!

You should do big smoke’s order from grand theft auto san andreas
Ok. You should definitely do the chocolate chip sundae supreme from Sonic Unleashed! I would love a recreation from one of my favorite games!
This was really fun!  Can you do the Cookie Cat from Steven Universe?
Why do you always bring me back my childhood memories. You're amazing
Didn’t know what creme de la creme was but knew immediately from the thumbnail that THat is how a mouse nibbles and I know that mouse lmao
Still hoping to see Spongebob's improvised Sundae, someday.
SO nostalgic! Thanks so much for this!!!
Can u make the Tom and Jerry milk that made Jerry Buffed AF
Bringing back memories! They always made that stuff look delicious!
Yo Babish! You should make Big Smoke’s order from GTA:SA even tho the meme died down a year ago.

Babish you're the best, man. Your recipes are really intelligent and easy to follow unlike so many other shows I've seen
I was so sure as a child I had discovered what this combo tasted like but I’m sure it was just whole milk and a digestive biscuit/rich tea biscuit and was absolutely nothing like this
Another great one! Would love to see you make the Valentines meal from Mrs. Doubtfire!
How about recipes from daredevil
You look similar
To kratos from god of war
Could you make the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster from Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy??

Mr. Skeltal is proud of you, Babish.
Andrew - On Thanksgiving I made a huge prime rib dinner and knew I'd have leftovers. I posted on a local reddit (r/hamilton) and asked if anyone is down and out. I got one response in particular and gave him a huge tupperware container containing 16oz cut of Thyme encrusted Prime rib, Garlic Mashed potatoes, some quick pan seared asparagus in some smoked acho chilli oil (I hate boiled asparagus) Corn, Buns, Home made gravy, etc etc etc. 

He LOVED it. Like... texted me afterwards and thanked me profusely. 

If you're looking to brighten someone's day - You should try offering up some of your FREAKING AMAZING food to the homeless - I'm sure its been YEARS since some people have had such flavours get to know eachother in their mouths. 

This guy in particular stated he was just going to have a hungryman microwave dinner for his thanksgiving dinner. This cheered up his night.
I've always wanted to eat this! 😋😋😋

Hey Babish could you make some food from my favorite anime, it’s called JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Specifically from the part 4 episode: Let’s Go Eat Italian Food.” The dishes include: Mineral water made from snow on Mt. Kilimanjaro.
Antipasto made of mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, Tonio’s special vinaigrette, Triangle toast, and lettuce.
A dish called “Harlot spaghetti” (btw the subtitles have the recipe as well).
Lamb with an apple sauce (no recipe for it sadly).
And flan for dessert.
I hope you see this long comment I made.
Thanks!

Dude do some of the foods in burnt  by bradley cooper.
I thought they were sweet biscuits :((

I have been waiting for this my entire life.
One of my favorite scenes in the movie ❤️
I love this so much!!
"Because we dont want it to puff as much a pie crust would puff if a pie crust could puff wood" riiiggghhhttt
I always thought they were sweet. Like cookies, or digestive biscuits.
It is interesting that the quirky "I forgot to shoot this" or "i messed that take up" scenes are now written into the script. Many cooking channels do stuff like that to the point of even acknowledging and joking with their crew.

After seeing your bts and setup I don't really buy the YouTube channel on man show vibe you had starting out anymore but that's not lesseningy enjoyment. Just wanted to be a smartass and write my observation.
Hey Babish please make Miss Katherine’s Spiced Peaches from Holes!! 😄😄

Since you’ve done the Strudel and Big Kahuna burger, might as well do the White cake from Django Unchained.
Rolling it out as thin as humanely possible means to roll it as thin as you can before it becomes cruel and unnecessarily harmful to the dough. You may have meant "as thin as humanly possible" which would mean as thin as a human could make it.
You need to do a duo with Gordon Ramsay

My mom would make a creamy chicken noodle soup a lot when I was younger, and I always thought of it when I saw Creme de la Creme on Aristocats. It blows my mind knowing that this whole time it was sweet instead of savory.
My 7 month old couldn’t take her eyes off this 😍
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
I have been waiting forever for someone todo this

When I was a kid, I had soup every day for lunch with some Ritz crackers. EVERY TIME, I would reenact that scene. "Just a few dunks!" My mom thought I was frickin weird.
The aristocats is me absolute favorite movie, I got so excited when I saw you made this, because this is easily the number one Disney food I've wanted to try
I'VE WANTED TO EAT THIS FOR MY WHOLE LIFE
Barth's Burgers, can't believe you haven't done that yet. But maybe that's low-hanging fruit?
I have wanted this my entire life.
I always wanted to try this
YYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
You don’t know how badly I wanted this when I was little. I even tried to major myself but it didn’t turn out that well.
"I don't WANT to do this it's my job!" no Babish, you wanted to do that, don't lie to yourself.
Krabby patty from spongebob
I always pictured it tasting like a garlic and herb thing, rather than a milky sweet taste.
Who else clicked on this because of Aristocats!
Lemme see some Krabby Patties
you double dipped the chip!
I always wanted to try this as a child! Love this one!!
Can you do good burgers ed sauce
I didn’t see the title of this until I was in the video, but clicked because the thumbnail reminded me of Aristocats and that’s one of my fave childhood movies 😍 This is so cool :)

This looks so very good.  Hope this doesn't make you sleepy. :D
Dude thank you this is my childhood
Was that a woman's laugh?! Damn you Babish for cheating on me!
The nostalgia 😻 movie food when I was kid always looked like it beyond good, even the leaf in Land Before Time.
You should make the Cress Soup from The Witches, i know that thing turned everyone into a mouse but I've always wanted to try it, specially because from the way all the witches eat it in the movie makes it look like is the best soup in the world.
I have always  wondered wtf that stuff was

My favorite old cartoon movie has a recipe recreation! Hell yeah!
"Hi everyone! It's me, Ben Creme De La Creme!"
Six-year old me is squealing right now. A. I love this movie with all my heart, I watched it in French! B. I always thought the Creme de la Creme á la Edgar would be so tasty; better than Ovaltine perhaps!
You don’t understand how exited I was when I read the title
This looked so good to me as a kid on aristocrats
My heart hurts, so cute
0:38 Let those dry ingredients get to know each other  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Tolong subscrebe balik
Bro, I wanted to eat that so bad as a kid
O MY FLIPPING YES!
Damn, ritz are a ripoff...
Hey Mr. Babish! Thx so much for making these videos. The first video I watched was the Red Dead Redemption stew video, and I just loved It! If you don't mind making another out door cooking video that would be awsome.
This may be a somewhat obscure request, but you should make the cookies from little Nemo adventures in slumberland.
I reference this all the time!! This and tree stars were both peak dream cuisine as a kid
FINALLY
Why did u go Scottish at 1:43😂
I'd like to see your take on that bread Rey ate in The Force Awakens
An episode of Gilmore Girls foods would be cool. Plenty of options to choose from!
oh yeah yeah
Awwww. That's adorable.
Your wife is lucky for having you I mean damn your like a master chef
You missed the opportunity to drink the milk and then pass out
I’m sorry if this has already been asked before,,,,, but are you not lactose intolerant? I could’ve sworn you mentioned it in an earlier episode (I think it was the cocktail special).
Am I the only one thinking that I could finish that?
Eating makes you gay. Oh yeah yeah

Creme de la creme a la Edgar, if you know what I mean 😏
The broodwitch, from aqua teen hunger force.
AHHHHHH <3
Why am i watching this omg
I-zombie special please
Omg I looove that movie!
Omg I love this! I was obsessed with Aristocats as a kid and would actually make my own creme de la creme all the time. I think that was a digestive/tea biscuit that roquefort eats though. While I have never tried it with crackers I can say it's really nice with Mcvities digestives...
That wipe transition tho 👌👌👌
“Just a few dunks”

Where did you buy your rolling pin?
You know it’s for cats right?
Lol I always wanted to try this as a kid  even though he pretty much drugged the poor kittens. I use to parented my soup was the mix and eat it with ritz crackers 😂😂
Ever since the first time I saw Aristo Cats I've always wanted to eat that
Mississippi queen from regular show would be great, idk if it counts as a drink or not but whatever
Cats can’t even taste sweet things, so the creme de la creme would have to be savory.
Any chance of sharing what watch you are wearing in this episode?
That was almost ridiculously adorable!
This was my childhood and I always wanted to eat it lol
Hold on. That is not Crème de la Crème à la Edgar, that is Crème de la Crème à la Babish
Think you could make fish fingers and custard from Doctor Who?

This recipe was my dream as a child
You must’ve slept week after that

The circle has been completed
As a French kid, I imagined the biscuits tasted like "galette bretonne".  On another note, I always thought the black powder Egar sprinkled over the milk was pepper xD I just thought that was weird
“I don’t want to do this it’s my job” lol
Pause at 4:52 for a Lady's POV of Babish.

You don't know how long I've wanted to eat this for
My favourite movie ever
I was wondering when you’d do this one!!
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeaaaaaa I hope you had a good day
This episode was brilliant! You are such an entertaining guy Babish. You should be winning all these youtube awards and getting social media fame rather than most of the insanely annoying and cliche youtubers out there. Goddamn millenials
it's not even funny how many times i've watched this movie. i can probably recite half of it!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Am thinking about buying Andrew's first book: eat what you watch, is it worth it?
Mmmmm rits are my fav
Ah! You just got a new sub. You're funny, this was my FAVORITE movie as a kid and I've always wanted to try this, aaaand this looks delicious. Thank you ♡♡♡

I would really love to see something made from naruto. Maybe ichiraku ramen or since you already made a ramen based video you could make “the curry of life” that was involved in episodes 152-157   It’s a great show and I would really enjoy seeing you bring a unique food to life
I didn't even know how badly I wanted this until I clicked on the video and saw it was from the Aristocats. I actually squealed and I'm not ashamed to admit that.
Did you fall asleep
I want 😥
I love when you do cartoon food. It really makes me happy. This has been a real shit year. Thank you for helping me get out of my own head
Omg my favorite childhood movieeeee
My mom used to make this when I was very small after I watched this movie. This was a nice lil nostalgia trip 🥰
So nostalgic for me. Used to make a hot drink of milk, sugar, vanilla and cinnamon for my sisters and they'd call it Vanilla Tea! (What's more coincidental is one time we had it with cookies while watching Aristocats)
Okay okay okay...... I thought I liked you a lot before. But now I'm in love. This was my favorite movie as a child!
what's the watch babby?
Plz do foods from portlandia plz
Can you make a monster Krabby patty?
Vanilla is toxic to cats anyway

everybody wants to be a cat
MY CHILDHOOD
I love that movie
I've been waiting for this recipe my whole life, i remember when i was a youngus i used to dip ritz crackers in milk and try to eat them like they were corn on the cob to this scene so that I could eat this vicariously, thank you thank you
2:45 b,but that's the secret ingrediant that brings out the flavor!!!(lol)
Have you ever tried making food Ghibli films? They always look so delicious!!
This why I love this guy. I was just watching aristocats and my niece wanted to try
I need Chinese subtitles. QWQ

legit I used to eat my ritz crackers by nibbling the tiniest bits off and saying (to no one in particular) "my compliments to the chef!" between bites like monsieur roquefort did in the movie bc i was a freaking nut case
I didn’t know I needed this
Please do tom and jerry special
Where's forest gump shrimp part 2 :'(
That shit always looked tasty
Okay but did you get sleepy?
This is my favorite video you've made. I LOVE Aristocats.
Why haven’t you made anything from Gilmore Girls yet Babish? Here’s a few ideas: 
From Emily Gilmore’s kitchen: sweetbreads, bread pudding, gourmet twinkies, marzipan candy
From Suki’s kitchen: suki’s famous risotto, apricot sauce, full course renaissance meal, turtle soup (as requested by Richard Gilmore)
From Mrs. Kim’s kitchen:  Tofurkey! 
From Luke’s diner: eh it’s basic stuff. Sure it’s yummy though
Notable mentions from forgettable characters: devilled eggs from Sherry’s baby shower, snails/escargots Lorelai and Chris brought back from France
Please do Marmalade from Paddington!
Ben Dela Creme
My name is edgar
Can’t wait to see what your going to do with the stories !

I love Aristocats! Thank you for making this ☺️
Oh yeah yeah






Love your vids btw.
1:54 (spongebob the movie) "bald, bald!" "MY EYES!"

Dude, 5 year old me is so happy watching this! Thank you so much! 
Also, please de Studio Ghibli style food!!
My childhood wishes have been granted.
You should make the meat pies from Sweeney Todd or I’ll never be at peace
Tiny to large whisk transition was incredible
This made my night. 😄
You know, Edgar is kind of the victim of this story. He spends his whole live serving the rich old bat, and she leaves her entire fortune to a bunch of cats.
That's a slap to the face if I'm any judge. Even her lawyer thinks she's batty.
Told you it was Edgar.
Mi hombre favorito🔥
YESSS THIS IS EVERYTHINF
Oh yeah yeah

Just watching you always cheer me up ive been trying to fight not wanting to hurt my self and its an everyday battle but enjoying vidioes like this just really makes me feel better
The most under rated disney movie
😍 I used to pretend to make this with my sister when I was a kid!
The description for this video is amazing because it's so true
Hey babish, I sent you the mail you asked me to. Can you make a cookie next vid in the shape of my youtube profile picture?
I literally gasped when I saw this haha 
I've wanted to try that ever since I first saw that movie many moons ago
Oh yeah yeah, rise brothers, 57% percent of the YouTube realm has been conquered by the MaximillionMus army, we won the battle, but the war has just begun.
Hot vanilla sounds amazing! I'm going to try to make this sometime.
Ahhh this is my favorite movie I am so happy you did this !!!
this was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and it literally never occurred to me until after i finished this video that this dish was sweet and not savory. my child self just had her mind blown.
HELL YES
That whisk edit! Brilliant! 😂
These guys trend with every video...impressive.
This is what I call content
