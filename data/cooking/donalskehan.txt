And we are LIVE! What do you think of this new series! Also will you be making this recipe?
1:33 that "ITALIAN" warning made me laugh hahaha! 😂🤣
“We need to add a little water to cook this out.” Proceeds to add 1.5 litre of water to the pot 😂😂😂
‘A little touch of passata, about half a jar’ proceeds to pour the whole jar in 😂
My dinner party is sorted with this recipe.
This looks delicious, I'm definitely gonna try it! And as an italian, I can assure you we're not all that bad
My Italian husband appreciates that I love pasta. 😊 Thanks for the recipe!
I came for the Italian comments. Haha
Im fasting and this looks beautiful! Seems like it would be the perfect quick but tasty fix to break ones fast! Yummy! Can’t wait to try! I wont be able to find nduja that is halal so i will use regular non-pork chorizo instead!
I imagine Donal as a lion tamer with a chair and whip being all "BACK AWAY ITALIANS!!!"
I like how you give reasons for all the steps which helps in understanding how the recipe comes about. Thank you Donal 💙
Why don't you try something PAKISTANI dishes or subcontinent in general
I love all ur one pan dishes thanl u love frm bangladesh.... i just wanted to commnt i wish this will be seen ... 😊😊😊 i have also made one pan pasta thank fr teaching love ur work u too ... love italy🏵🏵🏵🍁🍁🌹🌹🌷🌷
Amazing recipe! Looks delicious! ❤️
i used to watch your show on TV.. love your recipes always !!
Great! Donal, I'm loving the new series! They are wonderful and I can't wait to start cooking!!❤️❤️
Irish Men are underrated.
Even if I can't make this for dinner tonight, you're videos are so aesthetic to watch 💜
I simply love the way you use turquoise in your kitchen.
Need to convince my family to try this and hopefully they won’t complain it is too spicy lol I’m the only one who likes hot food!
Who's watching this while fasting
Foodielicious! Donal, you know how to wake me up in the morning! I love your channel and my friends are addicted to it also! You're the man!
I’m trying this one. Great sausage place near me too.
Now to work out where to buy Nduja in Newcastle! Looks great!
Can you replace the nduja with sobrassada?
Wow can't wait to try this!! It looks amazing!
I tried most of ur meal....; wow!wow! Wow all family love it - thank you! I shared ur channel with all friends xx
Wow looking so delicious! I ike spicy food! 💕💕💕💕💖💖

Probably gonna Google "Pasta facial" later
Dude, we're not all bad.
Fell in ♥️ with this receipe

It's looks Soooooo Delicious & Yummm toooooo😋😋😋😋😋ummmmm Nice one again Donal☺️
Yes! Donal is cooking on camera again! Okay, I'm re-subscribing. Huzzah! And, as I am not Italian, I will totally try making this but with vegetarian chorizo instead of the nduja.
I love spicy stuff a loooot with pasta........... OMG.......... an explosion in mind and mouth

Yum yum 😋
Pastaaaaaaaa
Amazing yummy pasty. Love this recipe.

Looks so good, any tips for dairy free alternative to mozzarella for this dish??
I am sure we are gonna have some ANGRY italians in the comments!!
Oh man they are gonna get MAD!!

Great mid week dinner thanks Donal
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him soooooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs cant wait to pat max while am in usa in September tell max he is my friend drooling over my samsung galaxy j4 love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I love the new series 👍👍
♥️♥️
You really should try The Tomato Stall Oak Roasted Tomatoes in oil. They are amazing.. Perfect for this dish.
Please please can we have one recipe without cheese.
Love your channel, but I do think you use pasta/spaghetti for a lot of your dishes.. would be great if you tried some healthy national/international dishes and made them easier/better etc. That would be fun and interesting.
aren't we all just scared of the italians lol! oh no don't call it carbonara if you're using pancetta and not guanciale! boy oh boy have we all been burned. hahah! i'm sure there are nice italians who don't mind at all but most of them are very very protective of their recipes eh. respectfully to the italians, i would like to have fun when i cook. heheh.
If I don’t have Nduja, what’s the alternative?
lovely dish I know very tasty
Is nduja readily available in regular supermarkets? Is there a more common substitute that could work?
I was only using Great Food for Less earlier! You signed it and all at the launch in Dubray on Grafton Street donkey's years ago.
Delicious looking recipe! But just wondering, is the audio alittle off? Static sometimes when you speak alittle louder maybe?
FIRST
😳💙❤️💙❤️
Oh my god, that stringiness... Just Perfect
What if we cannot find the nduja sausage? is there any alternative?
oh so yummy......
1.5 liters of cold water or boiling? or does it not matter
Nduja is Italian...?
Love your videos donal i have been watching you since you were on tv 👍
I love pasta.......!!!!!!😍😍😍
I live in the UK but can’t find Nduja anywhere, please help!
Love weeknight dinner recipes 😍
If I can’t find that sausage what can I use???
Interesting, you didn't seasion it it cos the sausage is already very well seasoned. Any recommendations on where to get nduja? Always wanted to use it in sandwiches and pasta
Any suggestions for a vegetarian substitute for the salumi? looks delicious
Its MY way of cooking...I love it ..BUT THAT SAUSAGE IS NOT ITALIAN...so please stop saying that it belongs to us...
I’m sorry..however Andouille sausage is NOT an Italian sausage..it’s a French creole sausage indigenous of Louisiana..
Who had these bars growing up? I had never seen them till we came to the US! 🍋
I love lemon desserts, this looks amazing. Thanks for sharing.
There is little better in the summer than a luscious lemon bar. Except, of course, if you top it with meringue and make lemon meringue bars! 😋
Haha, the effects of parenthood, eh? Donal’s glossy chocolate brown hair has started graying and he’s now got a shadow under his chin. That’s all good though, they’re the signs of a good father who’s so worried about their child’s wellbeing they’re stressing themselves to the extreme lol.
Thanks for this great recipe! I made it today!!! Perfect !!! 😋😋😋
Awww man..I really want those edges!!! 🥺😋😳
Im definately tryimg these today. Looks so good. 😍😍. 
Also do you have any recipe for a flourless biscuit cake?  I was looking for one but couldnt find any.
I can't wait to make these for my husband! He loves lemon bars, lemon curd - any lemony dessert. Thanks so much Donal :-D
Lemon bars were a staple at our school bake sales. Loved them growing up!
Yum looks delicious i will be in usa in September to celebrate my 21st birthday see you guys in September tell max i love him sooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs cant wait to pat max while am in usa in September tell max he is my friend drooling over my samsung galaxy j4 love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
Brilliant recipe ! I will it at home for iftar in Ramadan 💖
These Classic Lemon Bars are so adorable, incredible and super fancy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely i will be trying these lemon bars thanks Donal
Lemons are not easy to find in Brazil. So, do you think it is a good idea to use lime? Hum!!! Maybe I will do a caipirinha lime bar!
Meee toooo Sooooooo tatisyyyyyyy yummiee recipe 😋😋😋😋😋😍😍😍😍😍
Yum. Looks really good. I've made Lemon bars before, but yours are a little different. Definitely want to try them.
Who else noticed the curd was slightly burned ? When he was getting it out of the pan😄
Never had these as a Dutchie. Guess it's time to make some!:)
AH lemon bars are my fav!
I have been waiting to this.... 😉😉😉
very tempting.... will follow your recipe and be happy hahahaha.
Thank you,The recipe was very good 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
That's tempting.........will surely give it a try 😊😊😊
I have had them but never with coconut! I look forward to making these!
I’ll admit I’m not the greatest cook but might have to have a go at this looks really nice
Best dish for ramadan
Thank you for this, can I do this recipe without the cocunut? Will I have to do more flour?
This looks amazing and apparently it’s something I’ve been craving because I can taste the lemon right now. Might give this one a shot. Cheers!
First lol
Love sweet tooth already 😍🙌
Mmmmm I haven't had a lemon bar in ages! I'll have to make this soon!
Your recipe is very very good I love your recipe
Your Millionaire's shortbread is my favourite!! Can't wait to try this!!🍋
Donal tis far from lemon bars you were reared 😂
Donal do you have a good recipe for torta dela nona cake?
Looks fantastic. Need to try this. 😊
This looks really tasty indeed. Will try this one out soon, for sure. Thank you for sharing!
I wish we could stop calling every other recipe the "best", "ultimate", "perfect" and so on. Its not a very helpful descriptor anymore - its almost a meme at this point ^^;
Not a fan of lemon but I still clicked because it looked so good.
Loooove lemon bars! I grew up eating them all the time after school. (Also, love this more old-school Donal style video!) 😍♥️
Lemon bars are the dessert you see at bridal showers or that "go to" dessert to take to a family party.
My favorite💖
OMG I love lemons and tropical stuff soooooooo muchhhhhhhhh
Can you make with shop bought curd instead?
Greeting"s Chef!!  This Sous Chef is going to modify your recipe, and make it Key Lime Bar"s!!  YUMMY~ LICIOUS....
♥️👌
I will try it for iftar in Ramadan.
❤❤❤
perfect for summer! Thanks Donal!
.....off to the grocery store for lemons I go!
Subbed unconditionally ♥
Yes tamp is a word, you tamp an espresso grounds into a gasket for example.
Your videos make me really happy.  Thanks man.
Looks tasty
Made them. Super easy and quick to make. Base really nice, crunchy and chewy at same time
Mmmm😊👅👅👅Love't 🍋🍋🍋😍 Bravooo chief👌👍🏼👏👏👏
My ultimate favourite!  Thanks
can't wait to try it
If only I had an oven, I love anything with lemon curd!
These bars are so easy to make and healthy. I am waiting to try this out. It's just so yum. All the ingredients are available at home. I am definitely going to try this out. Love this amazing recipe.
YUM! Can you send me some Donal? I'm sure they'd taste like heaven with my Earl Grey tea :)
delicious recipe!
Wow ser underbara ut. Måste testa att göra dom snarast. 😃
They look sooooo delightfully delicious! I'm making these now, will update once they've come out and cooled and been tasted! :D
Hello! This looks amazeing! 😍🤤I'm not so fond of coconut, so I'm wondering if it is ok to drop it altogether, or must it be replaced with something else? 🤔
Why am I looking this in Ramadan 😭😭
Love Lemon Bars! ❤️
Ive already watched this Donal
Soo no one noticed the fail in 3:15?😂
Yum! I love lemon bars. You have a point, though. I certainly haven't seen many lemon bars since I moved to Germany.
I love lemon bars! This looks absolutely delicious! But I wonder if there's an egg free way to make this?
I love this! Amazing! But where do you stay bro? Because I want to meet you? I want to meet you because your all recpies are amazing! Please tell me. ☺☺☺
Can't we make it without the egg yolks??
Hi donal!!
Donal are you trying to make me fat....
Hi donal, I have one question. Can I substitute the corn flour with all purpose flour?
Yummy I'll try it 😋
Yumm yumm yummm.. 😋😋😋
I don't really like lemon, can this work with other Citrus?
Looks delicious! Also yes, tamp is a word and you used it correctly lol 

Do you have a zester you recommend? Whenever I try to zest stuff, it just gets macerated and sticks to the grater
Tamp is indeed a word & I love any sort of lemon dessert.
These will be perfect for Mother's Day!
Lemon bars are my favorite I always add more lemon juice than called for and hope for the best. Lol
Is corn flour corn starch
You're not giving any measurements. Are you using a boxed mix? How much sugar? How much corn starch?
How is it possible to post a recipe without giving the grammages? That's why most of ppl go wrong cuz they measure ingredients by eye. It's totally unacceptable! Shame cuz i really wanted to try.
Why is EVERYONE so obsessed with coconut?!!?!?!  It makes me sick.  What would you use in place of the coconut?
I’m watching you from Qatar.
Your recipe so amazing, just could write down the Ingredients.
Ok guys we are BACK BACK BACK! Which of the 4 series are you most looking forward to?
I am hoping that you get more subscribers out of this! This is an exciting relaunch of your channel. ☺️ I am looking forward to your videos! The best of luck, Donal! ☺️
I’m looking forward to the desserts!! Please include some vegetarian dishes if you can.
Sweet Tooth and Click Plate look fun, but the pasta might be my fav.
Lovely to see you’ll have two new shows and lots of recipes! Best of luck with the new series. I’ve been keto for a couple years now, but I can convert just about anything to low carb - even your Pavlova. Looking forward to it all.
This looks great Donal I can not wait to see your version of Brigadeiro. and I would love for you to make the traditional Brazilian Pudding with love from BRASIL 💕
Sweet Tooth sound nice! But I really can't wait to see... the bloopers... ;)
I'm italian and I love your pasta recipes :)
Congratulation for your relaunch channel. Hope it can more grow up. I love making some pasta. I will keep on my eye for sweet tooth and 5 ingredients chicken dinner 💚
I'm most excited for the pasta dishes. I cannot survive without pasta, and more recepies are always good.
Im italian and love this channel! Can’t wait for the new series 👌🏻🥳
Click Plate for the food, Italian for the comments.
this sounds awesome
can't wait for those series :)
Can't wait to see and taste your foolproof and delicious recipes, Keep up the good work.
Wow your editing is mind blowing..
Donal, I am really looking forward to the relaunch. Wishing you the best of luck and here's to many great and inspiring recipes.......Excelsior.
I'm EXCITED about all of the new series, looking forward to 1 MILLION subscribers, 🤩
Excited for your new content and series!!! 😍
Really cool relaunch! Looking forward to them tasty chickens 😋
I'm looking forward to sweet tooth and the chicken dinners. Hopefully there will be some eggless or even slightly healthier sweets recipes 😊.
Excited for baking and anything not spicy! But I love it all anyway!
Very excited for 5 ingredients or less- I like cooking just not all the hassle and cleanup!
I am looking forward to all of this! I am especially looking forward to the 5 ingredients and pasta dishes. Bring it Donal!!!
Great news Donal. Looking forward to these new videos!
Yes Donal! So excited for this and for you! Wish you all the success
My daughter loves Pasta, so the weeknight pasta dishes sounds fab. Also looking forward to the sweet tooth recipes too.
I’m looking forward to the pasta series because carbs are my jam!
I cant wait for the 5 ingredient dinner series!
Looking forward to the relaunch! This will be you at your best!!
I'm most excited about all of them!
More gluten free options please.
Looks good. The thing about Italian food is that it isn't monolithic. My heritage is Neapolitan, but someone whose family is from Florence or Venice or some other region will have a somewhat different culinary experience. Look at Lidia Bastianich. Her recipes are definitely different, but the thing is, it's all good. Just keep on trying.
Sounds awesome, love this channel💝
5 ingredients dinners, hhmm

Now where have heard that... Before...?
Nice!!!! Looking forward to all. Good luck.
I'm so excited for everything!  :)
cant wait looking forward  to all of it
I love the new format, Donal. I'm hoping it works our for you and expands as time goes.
Can’t wait, ya hey all sound awesome
Yayyyyyy, i love all of your italian and cake recipes
Exciting!  I'm looking forward to desserts, especially cakes and the chicken dishes.
Love that! Go for it! 😍
Yay!  Cant wait to see them.  So excited. 😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤ btw ive tried so many of your recipes they've all turned out great.

Can't wait yeah!

Your fan from Aden
I'm excited about all of it!!!  You're too stinking cute Donal, "like I haven't offended enough Italians already"  LMFAO and I'm Italian!!! 
😂💙💜💚
I’m so excited!!! ♥️♥️♥️
I used to be a subscriber, and I will happily be one again as long as you go back to cooking on camera instead of just narrating someone else doing it.
All of it sounds good
The video is good, it's great, thank you for sharing

Hi Donal, thanks for a brilliant channel. You're recipes are very popular with my family. Have just come back from Italy so can't wait for the pasta recipes. I promise i won't be offended. I will just enjoy the fabulous and family and budget friendly meals that we are lucky to receive from you. Thanks so much.
These all sound nice but please dont stop the og recipe videos
Sounds like we will learning  a lot thank you
❤️❤️💜❤️❤️
You should probably just name the pasta segment "ways to offend Italians"
Will the older videos be deleted as a result of the relaunch? I'm excited for the new content, but I do love an awful lot of what's already up!
I like it....
WOW..! Can't wait..! Nobody Does It Like Donal..!
So excited!!!

Congrats, Donal! This is such an exciting expansion for your channel and brand. I personally am looking forward to ALL of them - they sound great! Can't wait to see it launch! 💗💗
Chef, I have been looking for a type of Italian Christmas cookie I had as a child, (friends brought it to our fam party). They were thin, snowflake cookies, anise flavored, and lightly dusted with powdered sugar, (which I always knock off, disgusting). Their texture is like biting into a thin pastry, not firm @ all. If you know what I'm talking about, PLS LMK!!
I think it's so delicious.
It's night in Korea, but I want to try it now.
be hard to fall asleep
If Donal made popcorn I would watch it...
Let's face it. Everyone knows how to make pancakes we just watched it to see Donal and/or for the Quacker ad
These look so delicious! 😍 Can't wait to try them! 😎
Looks like u are working out more than never 💪 your shape is better lol !! Is that quantity of oil necessary! I just thought too much
i just want to know how old he is, he looks incredibly young and he is extremely talented
I know how to speak brit accent even im filipino.

I think it is very healthy dessert for me! So healthy & so delicious! It's looking so tempting! Also it can also be a good Breakfast! 😙😙😙😙💖💖💕
Donal pls do a q&a i have a question.:)
Bless you Donal! I have wanted an oat pancake recipe for AGES!!
Yum, must try.
Oooh Donal you can make anything tasty and I love you because you add a few twists to the recipe and make it deliciossss . Love you Donal😘😘😘😁😁😁😋😋😝😝

Looking healthy and yummy! Gonna try this in Hong Kong !
Looks amazing!!  Cant wait to try it. Now I know what my breakfast is going to be. 😍😍😍😍😍. Love your channel and hope Sophie,  Noah and max are doing well.
Just having Blueberry pancakes are enough for me! Thanks for sharing!
Loving this, have to try!
The only thing that would improve this video would be for him to describe the process ASMR-style. But then he wouldn't be Donal!😂
Thanks for recipe . I'll  try it :) voice is sooo niece
Anyone know the name of the song playing at 5:00 - 5:20....?? Its regular on here, but cant find it.
It is a beautiful eyes like blueberries lol! This recipe was helpful!
I love pancakes 😍😍😍 and they look absolutely delicious......!!!!!!😋😋😋
Patience is always a plus while cooking. Will be trying that Quaker Oat milk, thanks Donal. Btw, I love freezing extra pancakes and waffles, as they come in handy for a quick grab for breakfast or snacking😊
Love this recipe and gotta try it. 💖
ciao, bellissima ricetta
Great recipe!
I never saw oat beverage in a supermarket. Where do buy it?
Hiee Donal😍 I really love ur all recipez they are really sooooooo dammmm looking Tastyyyyz 😋😋😋n u look sooo Cutiiee by d way I too make some food recipez ☺️ 🌼
You are the best chef because your recipes are so easy to follow and work fist time. It makes my day when I see your posts. Wishing you and your lovely family all the best from down under in Sydney
Ur such a great chef!
I love all pancakes! And I love the intimacy of these types of videos hahaha, make more of them please >_<
Yum! I'm always on the lookout for a good dairy alternative since we discovered that my daughter is lactose intolerant. Thanks for the recipe. These look delicious.
Hey donal its me the one you messaged i have in the past hopefully i can again in the near future:) yeah love your vids go to philuppines pls
These are really good! Thanks
😋 yummy looks delicious and easy to make. I am definitely going to try this. Thanks for sharing 👍
Greetings from Singapore! These pancakes looked absolutely lovely and tasty! And blueberries - my fav; yummy! I wish we here those oat beverages sold here. We do have other Quaker products but haven’t seen this beverage,   as yet. Maybe Quaker might launch it here soon.
Yay!
I’m malking them right now 💓
Fantastic oats and blueberries pancakes Recipe.  Looked absolutely delicious
I just love pancakes. I can eat many of them. Trust me this pancake is so healthy and delicious. Blueberry gives it a nice kick. It's so tasty. I am definitely going to try this out tonight. Yum...
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him soooooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs see you on friday in Singapore love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I love blue berry it amazing 😋😋😋😋
Could you replace the baking powder with a pinch of yeast? Legit might do that since I don't have the power heh 😮😏
One polite suggestion if I may?
Soak chia seeds for between two & 24 hours as nutrients are more easily absorbed by your body.
(Google soaking seeds or nuts for benefits).
One the one hand, it is sponsored, so immediately I want to reject it, However, Kerrygold, now is the only butter we use, and we love it. The Quaker Oats might not be in the same category, and I don't know who owns it now. I doubt we will be eating anything soon with those products,.
I love it...😍🤩😋👍😊
Healthy and as well as tastey
This is my kind of breakfast
In the end it really looks picturesque.
Love a good pancake recipe 😍
Great chef and singer
❤️❤️💜❤️❤️
More variant of pancake ,,Thanks DonaL,its very delicious oat meal recipe👍💐 I made it this evening 4 snack ,I served it  with some melted palm sugar,honey, n splash lime juice. 🍯🍮..
if you can find ''clean'' oat flour that means oats prossessed and farmed very separate to insure theres no trace of gluten in it you could make it totally gluten free then theres the problem of if theres gluten in the oat drink
Donal i know its late there but wat is your job?:)
Hey Donal would it still work with egg substitute or a flax seed mixture in place of the egg. I'm starting my new life as a vegan and this looks good but I don't want anything from animals. Thanks!
Ok, I have been making a kind of pig candy for over 30 years. My kids still say they love my bacon the best lol 😂 

Ok, I just thought about and learned about this in 1979 while in high school so 40 years
Oh my gosh I love the pig bacon, but imagine if they dipped in chocolate too!
Love candied bacon! Love the addition of the spices! 😊
Prepare for the Vegans....... hahahahaha
Ooh...  This feels yum...
Hello again donal! Im just wondering if you could do Filipino foods cause ive seen you didnt go there tho
Lit..have you gained?
I thought Claire looked familiar when I started watching this video. I’ve seen her cooking show on a local channel on my television. Food looks good. Don’t really eat bacon as much cause it gives my an upset stomach.
How cute 🤗
I love bacon
What a cool collab! So fun to watch...and that bacon 😱😱😱🤤
Had never heard of that! amazing 😍 We can't wait to see your reunion with Sofie,Noah and Max♥️ And please come to India someday!
I love it. Your recipes are so delicious.
Smoked or unsmoked?
Try the same thing with good quality maple syrup ;)
yummmmy 😍😍😍😍😋 very appetizing
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him sooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
Pls donal
Please come to India.
Looks good
So many delicious brunch recipes.  All of the delicious flavors of a brunch in one go?  Yes please, like the description says; the sad news is that I have never liked bacon, the kind made from pork anyway.
Candy bacon sounds wrong in so many ways...
Who is the two girls with u donal
very healthy ;)
Lol...bite sized pieces = 🥓 ain't no on eatin' those tiny pieces of bacon candy...lol...pass me 6 slices please! Candied bacon is sooo good! Try it with Spicy Pepper Jelly (melted down for a few seconds in the microwave) mixed with a touch of Dijon mustard!
I make a sugar slurry making a simple syrup and dunk bacon. No flipping neccessary both sides covered!
Shane dawson going to love this
Don't use American English good god
Make toddler candy.
Make human candy.
2:24
**1 unit of honey contains more sugar than 1 unit of regular sugar.
If you are vegan, you can replace honey for maple syrup ;)
EDIT: and you can substitute eggs for applesauce
Yes, my treat tonight!! And no banana bread without chocolat, i agree!!
I have been waiting for a dessert recipe♥️♥️♥️... thank you for uploading😋😋😋 I love chocolate 🍫🍫🍫

Okay Donal you are NOT helping my health goals! This looks amazing.
this Bread suuuuuper cool!
This chocolate bread is so gorgeous and super cool looking !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:55 i understand the thought of "keep it simple", and most of the times i do. But i do enjoy the baking process, so sometimes i feel like to spend an afternoon baking a more complex cake or dessert.
Willl try this one for sure when i am not on that mood ;)
Honey=sugar !
♥♥♥♥♥♥
They are so cute, and your beautiful brunch platter really made me salivate <3
I hate how easy this is and am afraid of making this every weekend.
Mine is ready to eat! I just replaced for rice flour and 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum. Chocolate chips n walnuts. Love that idea of honey as well! It turned amazingly 😱
The focus in shots of you talking was distractingly soft and the hilights a little blown-out, plus a skittish camera.  Hard to watch 😕
I love bananas, I enjoy banana bread and chocolate. But to have a recipe to combine two of my favorite flavors together to make a sweet treat? Priceless! Donal, you made my day awesome sauce. I love your channel and your recipes, you're a cool dude. I love Claire Thomas, I would watch her cooking show on the Justice Network every Saturday, she can cook and I like reading her blogs too. Double surprise, I like it!
Ive had some trouble with mine not coming out like i keep seeing in other peoples vids and images, if anyone could drop some knowledge down that would be amazing :)
Honestly, those potatoes look awesome
Hey donal can you please go to asia and do a food vlog pls
I use a pastry blender to mash up my bananas.
Ugh, DON’T lie and say there’s no sugar in it when you put honey in. Honey is basically liquid sugar
love ure channel so much BUT I WISH UD GO BACK TO DOING THE VIDEOS LIKE IN THE OLD DAYSSSSS. When we were able to see you cooking all the time in action not just talking and then seeing just ure hands :( :( :( plzz change it like beforeeee
Donal your previous way of making videos was amazing. This dubbing thing doesn't add that charm to your vids as it used to be.
I wanna see you cooking. ☹️
Another super short video. Don't be Tasty/food wishes, they have there own way of preparing/showing the food. I liked how your original format was. I miss it.
0:58 If that's "finely sliced" I've just became Gordon Ramsay...
The camera spins are cool but a bit dizzying
wow! asia meat ball!!!👍👍🤤❤
from korea 🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
Ive been watching you since you were cooking with the nonas. So please cook something like that. I like the ideas of one pan recipes but I think you can do much better. Thanks tho

Apsal teruk nau namanye ooiiiiin???
The editing is fire!
Gorgeous,yum yum yum
Love from Fergus Ontario. Made this for hubby yesterday and he thought it was awesome! Smashing hit in our home. Cheers
I love it a lot😍😋 since I love Asian food with chicken ..... Hope I can make chicken meatballs.......
What exactly is "5 Spice Pouder?" Which spices are in there? How can I replace it? :V
Early
I love Donal's meatballs...
your animations are making me dizzy
Watching cooking channel at midnight hehe
Donal is definitely developing a dad air.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
For anyone who wants to make this, the bok choy was added last.  It's a leafy lettuce.  He mixed it up with the snap peas in the voice over.  You can probably find corn flour in whole foods or trader joes (gluten free alternative), and I wouldn't worry about 'dark' soy sauce.  Just get a good quality one.
What we can you instead of meat ball?
Can’t wait to make this for lunch!
👌👍
Awasome 😋😋😋😋
Where is my fridge i need my food
I thought Asian meatball supposed to be a mix with flour. So it is not actually "meatball" since it usually has more flour. It looks like your regular Western meatball to me but, it still look delicious so yeah I am still wanna eat it.
Standard. Make it big. Get Lazy. Get an agency to do your food and become a narrator. Love this guy but want to unsub now
Donal im a fan can you pls go in philippines in every region we have yummy and sweet pastries and good.foods pls😯😯😯
Love your one pan meals Donal, hope you have a wonderful week!
That’s a lot of expensive and specialized ingredients dude..
The recipe is lovely but please go back to cooking this yourself. This feels way too much like the horrible Tasty videos buzzfeed do.
Pasta la vista baby!!
but is it really a donal skehan video if he doesn't eat it frightfully hot at the end tho 😂
Is it just me or are your videos getting shorter and shorter??
Hiya Donal. Been watching your vids for years now. Love the dishes you make, but I miss seeing you do the cooking from start to finish like your old videos! Any chance you could go back to that format? It felt more personal.
I love one pan dishes.  Anything  to save washing up.
I did not know this was that simple. I love chicken potatos and carrots.
wow.donal i love your one pan dishes.love from Bangladesh.in sha Allah i will try this dish and waiting for more easy one pan dishes like this.keep it up.
Donal's been working out. 😎
Looks so good. Im definately trying this..😊
Nice dish donal it look very tasty😋😋😋
Love these videos.. great food and Donal is real fun to watch...
Enjoying the high speed video cooking and the beautiful geometry from the lemon! Great video! Cheers! 🍷

One pan dinners for the win!
Why would you spoil such a lovely dish with bitter kale
Definitely gonna try this out. And donal is getting more beautiful with age.
Looks so good..........now that my dinner for today 😋😋

Yummy recipe
I can imagine how terrific that tastes. Cooking it covered with the vegetables - the chicken must be so juicy and delicious. I love fresh Tarragon. Probably, just for me, i would have gone in with some but not to much. Thanks for this!
Thats a lovely dish,easy too. Wanna try this. tfs
Is it me or does he look like he is 22 years old? I know he is in his 30s but I can't help but marvel at his young features
Hey Donal ur Recipes are really amazing 👌😍😍to cook as well as to eat they Taste really heaven, love your all Recipezzz 🙂🙂 Do check out Mine toooo☺️
Donal's Instagram is lit with delicious  delightful food 😃🥘😋🍲
Mhmm😋, looks yummy , and  pretty healthy too , I will definitely try this one soon! Keep up the good work 👍 Donald!
Lol were you having alcohol flush?
Does the chicken skin go from crispy goodness to floppy foreskin when you cover it with a lid and steam?
That music is awful
Excellent recipe, but I am an Indian, our chicken recipe is quite different
aren't you already tired of chicken thights? >.<
Yes pls would love to see more breakfast recipes, especially veggie based! Thank you for this <3 <3 <3
Never saw you peeling those perfect eggs, clever.😜
Yes more healthy breakfast recipes! 😀
800k subs!!!!!
"It only takes about 15 minutes to make". 😅
Yes, we want more healthy recipes please 💖
I want to see you cook again! For all we know it isn't even you! Come on!!!!!
Hi, Donal!
Good recipe, thank you, please make more breakfast videos, because all I can do for breakfast it to eat my granola (which I cooked earlier)
Wow man this looks utterly delicious. Totally trying for breakfast tomorrow morning.
Perfect instructions for "jammy eggs," which is what you need for making Scotch Eggs!  Thanks for such clearcut instructions.  Love the fritters, too.  ;)
I cannot wait to try this recipe this weekend. Would baking the fritters be an ok alternative to frying? trying to reduce my oil intake!
Always great recipes Donal, thank you. I feel healthier just watching that video.
Lovely recipe! Love to see more healthy ones :)
i love your videos are the best
Congrats on 8K!!!🎉🎉🎉
Wow! Stunning lad! Can't wait to try this, in fact I'm not gonna wait! I'm doing this now lol
Yum looks delicious saw the recipe already for this got the newsletters for my emails was browsing through your recipes on my computer in the afternoon or evening am in Singapore tell max i love him soooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
Finally a healthy recipe! Thanks, Donal!
1 minute ago Gang rejoice
Donal, you should note that the boiling time for eggs will depend on your elevation from sea level. At 800 ft, I need 8 min 45 sec. If you are in Denver, it will be much longer. The basics are great for the grated "whatever is left in the fridge." Fried sole (of shoe) has over 1M subscribers. :-)
You can make my breakfast anytime.
Love ur recipies
God, how I love Olive oil and eggs together with avocado <3 Donal sensei strikes again ^^
More vegetarian recipes please
Now I am soooo hungry... ^^
What a gorgeous, yummy breakfast! More please.
Looks amazing!!
Now I know what's my breakfast for tomorrow......😊😊😊
More breakfast recipes!
Looks great, how about a Huevos Rancheros recipe?
THIS IS THE ULTIMATE YUMMY BREAKFAST.............😋😋😋🍳
Great way to start the day
For the eggs, do you leave the heat up high / on boil while the eggs are cooking, or lower it to simmer and cover them as they cook for the 7 minutes, or have the heat set to a medium heat and not cover the eggs, or...? I ask because I always tend to over-cook my eggs and then end up hard-boiled. Thanks for the help!
What brand pan did u use?
Yammy 😍
Oooooh brinner!
Donal, PLEASE go back to cooking the food yourself on camera instead of just narrating.
Yum!
Love your video 💚💚 perfect boiled egg sounds great for starting the day
Breakie looks amazing, I'm super inspired! Thank you Donal
fantastic!
The perfect breakfast Donal!
Nice...but it looks more like lunch to me🙄😊
Too many eggs to be called healthy
I hate vegetables, but I would give at try, minus the eggs, avocado, and olive oil on top.
What can i use to replace the chickpea flour?
Yes more breakfast recipes
This looks delicious!!! Keep the veggie recipes coming!
Those eggs are just perfect.....😍😍😍
Lovely. Appetising.
Those eggs look so perfect.  Soft boiled eggs is my second favorite way to eat eggs, but I can't find the means to make them at home.  The most I can do for boiled eggs is hard boiled, and the texture of the yolk is disgusting for me when that happens.
Why dont u interact with ur fans or subscribers
Are the eggs room temperature or straight from the fridge before you boil them?
I hate how you got lazy and don't cook the food by yourself anymore. It took away the fun in watching the channel :(
Finally something I can do with my sweet potatoes!!
Did he... did he refer to a zucchini as a courgette? The only reason I knew what he was talking about is because in French we watched a movie called Ma Vie de Courgette. I’ve never heard an English speaker call a zucchini a courgette before.
Wheat flour and oil are not veggie 🙄🤔
feels bad man. You dont see Donal doing the cooking now he is just doing the talking ;_; Please bring back old style videos
Nice recipe but I find the format of this video with you not cooking much less engaging and kind of dull to be honest
LOVE THE EDITING!! but, i'd like to see you cook too donal...
Donal your channel is my favorite for recipes because most of the stuff you post I can make and they are tasty, I still make the chocolate cake recipe you posted a couple years back. The chicken recipes are good too and I can't wait to make this one. Your recipes are simple but so tasty. No frills.
I like to see him actually cooking.
Hey that seems tasty! I would love to see some Greek recipes in the future!
oh yeaaaaa finally!! I always look forward a recipe from your video.

Mongolian Beef? Let's go!!
This looks so amazing. And you make it look so easy I think even I could make it! <3 Thanks for the recipe.
Another great recipe Donal. I added some five spice to it, maybe not authentic but was delish.
Hi  ,  I  like   Your   Cake  
Racepi   Can  you  make ,    Avocado  Cheesecake   ,  opera  Cake  ,   Charlotte  Cake , 
Souffle  ,   Boston  Cream   pie..........
  ....please.......TQ .
Love all your recipes ... i loved ur one pan pasta i made it also
Doesn't eat meet 
But still watches Donal's video, because it's always sooooo amazing!!!!!
Thanks for sharing 😊
what the difference between super premium soy sauce and regular soy souce ??
Love love love this recipe so much - perfect for those rainy lunchtimes in springtime. Cheers Donal 🍷🍷🍷
Was waiting for a vid since days...❤️
Omg
I was watching Mongol history and this showed up in my subscription
Is this coincidence or what?
Am stunned
That looks a beast, simple not much effort too👍
Love the recipe Donal! Super easy and delish. Im gonna make this soon. Thank you for this.
Looks like a nice energy building dinner for a night of fisting. ✊
Ur lookimg realy change... Nd haircut
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him soooooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I love noodle dishes I'm making this at the weekend!
This looks great! Recently went to Mongolia and want to try this recipe out!
I can't thank you enough for uploading this video!! I have been searching for a decent and less complex Mongolian Beef recipe for ages, going to cook this soon!! In love with your YouTube channel and all the television series!!
He doesnt react or replies
Will try it today! Wish me luck! ;)
Sounds like a winner! I may try this out tonight!
Just made this tonight and the recipe was a great success, and there is still some left for tomorrow! 😋 Thanks a lot for posting this, and keep those awesome recipes coming!
It's actually the best recipe.....!!!!!😉😉 I don't eat beef by the way,  maybe I'll try it using chicken....
Hello! I am from Brazil and love your videos! Specially when you make foreign recipes. I will definately try this one
Looks soooo good!
As always you are amazing. Your recipes always look so delicious. Thank you for your hard work. Keep up the good work!!!
How do you make the cucumber spaghetti without a cucumber spaghetti maker?
Why your videos getting so short :( we want to see more of your amazing skills
Can we make a spicy version of this?
Yeaaaayy donal
I wish I can cook! 🤤😍😍😍
Im from philippines
Spectacular
Looks beautiful I always put broccoli through it for my family but I haven't been putting any ginger in it so next time definitely trying it out xx
Please make some Indonesian food recipe, have you tried any of Indonesian food?
Very fast with instant pot
Ohh, yuuummm. This looks like a different take on Bulgogi Beef, one of my all time favorites. Would you it make a lot of difference to use low-sodium Beef Broth in place of the water?
Looks delicious
I don't have corn flour, can I use normal flour instead?
I think you should show the cooking part like you used to. Leave the overhead camera style to the buzzfeed tasty guys. You do you. Hearing you talk whilst you cook is what i came for
If I want to use my slow-cooker, do I still need to sear the beef before it goes in? Looks tasty btw
Whst time does kitchen hero starts
OMG....................IT LOOKS DELICIOUS...I HOPE I CAN REPLACE BEEF WITH CHICKEN I GUESS..........BECAUSE I AM NOT A FAN OF BEEF MEAT....😋😍🍗
The dish looks delicious.  My husband and I were just talking about how we wanted to try  Chinese food at home.  You got the basics of Chinese cooking soy, salt, and sugar.
Nice recipe! Preferred the old style of videos you did though :)
Hey Donal, maybe it's just me, but your videos of the past few months don't sound good. It's like your microphone is not set properly or something. Sounds like old mono radios. The S sounds like whistling and the P is a bit hard.
Please go back to old style videos <3
I would love to see some more ‘experimental’ vegetarian recipes!🤗
This recipe is VERY good. It fits into my macros, it's fast and tastes delicious!
Thank you, Chef Skehan .
Greetings from Mexico City!
Looks delish as usual! Will definitely try this as soon as I can!
Did you add garlic too to the wok? It looks like garlic when you said ginger..,
Looks good! Is there an alternative to Kale and Edamame?
always serving us with the simplest yet freshest recipes! thanks Donal!
Imagine adding slithers of oranges into that salad! YUM!!
You had me at Sriracha, love that stuff. It's so versatile haha I add it to almost anything.
Great video. Thanks for sharing. Looking forward to your next video
I have tried the similar version but with teriyaki kick and Korean Dakgalbi. :)
It is so colourfull I want to try this
Love all the beautiful colors and pigments in this salad. Loaded with Phytonutrients.
Wold you ever be up to do something with Halumi cheese?
Omg found you recently n fell in love ❤
It would be great to see a couple of quick lunch box recipes, I'm always eating ready meals at work 😌
That looks absolutely delicious! Trying this on the weekend 😉
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him sooooooooo much and i say hi to him  love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
always.. thank you
bro this salad was delicious good job
Tomorrow is my exam need your wishes....☺
Where's the spring soup recipe?  I hear it's pretty good
OK...I've just finished taking the time to massage my salad...WAITAMINUTE!  You're already serving the finished dish!?  It all looks fantastic, but I'm exhausted just having watched this!
Looks like a Thai Recipe, without a Thai name.
Hi Donal. Would really love to see how to make pizza???  I just can’t get the dough right.. thank you for this I am soooo going to do this
Tried it this week, good stuff but can’t help but think the chicken would taste even better if paired with plain rice. (I know, not as healthy! 😂)

The chicken was brilliant, just felt like there was too much salad. 😂
Hot sticky chicken garnished with nuts... : ]
Definitely on the to-try list!
Donal, can you add some mochi or macaroons recipe to your dessert list?
More salads for everyone i think
This looks divine! Thanks for the recipe. ❤
Could you please make trees leches cake?
Looks delicious and I like all your videos.
I like the drumstick on the header of the video. :-)
How often do u reno your kitchen 😆
omg I am loving these frequent uploads♥️♥️love from India! come over to India someday!
This will take me an hour to make.
Mouth watering😋
ohhh yummm its spicy and hottt and yummmmy....😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋👍👍👍👍👌👌✌✌🥗🥗🥗🍗🍗🍗🍗 mmmmmm....sirrachaaaa.....I LOVE IT.........
I love Sriracha ♥️♥️♥️
Love this
Even your accent
Watching here @ #RiyadhKsa
From #Philippines
Boa tarde 👋👋👋👋
Colorful and tasty, this chicken and its salad look wonderful !
For information in Thailand, we usually use sriracha sauce as dipping, but it's a great idea to mix it with the chicken while cooking  ! 👌
Hope u remember me....
Whoa, the crunch,  the colours, the different textures!!... oooooo lalalala! :3
I have a question tho... Does it taste like Dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken)??? I will try my hands on this one for sure >:3 
Love your videos, always full of energy and positive vibes <3 
Stay blessed Donal Sensei!
Beautiful dish, Im definitely doing it. 2 thumbs up
Adding to my weeknight repertoire. Great, as always, Donal. I like the new format! The audio comes across crisper.
Delish 😀
All the colors and the flavors make for an awesome presentation and yummy meal. It is definitely one to make at our home.
donal youre fit
You have very nice videos
Yummy chicken
❤️❤️❤️
Awesome 💚
Whats the mname of the bgm i kinda like it
Pro tip for home cooking; Just get a 1-blade disposable razor from a supermarket if you want to emulate a high quality peeler. Normal people only do this a few times a year, so why waste perfectly good money?
BUT...WHY DID YOU DELETE AT THE FIRST UPLOAD....I WAS SO SAD THAT I CANT SEE THE YUMMY CHICKEN RECIPE AT THE FIRST UPLOAD ITSELF CAN YOU PLSS ANSWER ME.....PLSSS😢😥😥😭😭😭😔😔
Seems like you gain weight
Donal has been looking a bit chubby recently...
Indian recipes plzzz.....!!!!!
Looks colorful and yum
How do you stop your chicken sticking to the pan? Soon as I add chicken and it sizzles it sticks, its supposedly a non stick pan. Is my pan crap? Do I have it on too high heat?
I want to try but I don't know if we have siracha in trinidad never really seen it anywhere
1 quid = $1.31
please shave... your new look is not good.....iv been following you from many  days now and the clean shaved donal used to look better
2:40 "Hello, here we are, 2019, 8 cook books, 25 television shows, and he's mashing potatoes with a whisk!!!" I died😂😂😂
Take a drink every time Donal says potato
“Delicious globs of yum” 😂😂😂 Exactly! The world needs more Boxty! 🇮🇪 
BTW, I also make them with spring onions and Kerrygold Reserve Cheddar!
Dude, love this style of off the cuff videos, makes such a nice change to the 'Nigella' over stylised type.
in our region we always add marjoram into the potato pancakes... i think that will be my version of your recipe - no green onions (i really hate them) but with the marjoram... and i fry it on pork lard - gives it perfect flavour, better than butter in this case :-) totally unhealthy, but so good...
I could go for that. Add sausage gravy with a poached or sunny side up eggs on top.
As soon as I saw the video I clicked just so i could hear Donal say PODAYDOES
Also when Noah and Max are in the video, you love it even more! ♥️
Please, someone buy this man a potato masher.


*receives 387 mashers in the mail.
Looks super easy.. gonna try making them. Tnx Donal! But you make eeeverything look super easy though :)
Yay! Boxty is my fave! ❤️
These look yummy😄  Dear Donal, how much caffiene have you had🤔
I'm going to make these for my daycare kids 😍 I'm teaching them about Ireland
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him soooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your recipes making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I try this donal it's very nice and very tasty
I definitely need to try making delicious globs of yum
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS FFFFOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!! also cute babies <3
I'm Jewish so potato pancakes (latkes or s'vivvot) are part of my repertoire.  But I'm inspired by your Irish take, next time I'll add green onions and buttermilk.  I bet that'll be an improvement.  Thanks.
Best comfort-food cook in the world!!
They look banging mate
Donal grew on me! Lol. Such a fun personality! And the boxty looks so yummy!
Ok I'm crazy for chilli so I'd probably add some fresh chilli in the batter or some chilli flakes or both 😊 great recipe Donal...so going to try this !
Even I´m from Denmark I just love Boxties just as much as I love Colcannon. Thanks Donal. Looking forward to try your recipe with cheese....
Love your channel Donal. Lovely comfort food. 
Thanking you
I'm at Amanda's wedding in a church on Thomas Street.
Just wondering I've been reading about mirepoix. Is it worth doing? Thanking you in advance.
Celtic latkes.

Far out!
The spring onions is what adds most of the flavor. Would not be very good without them. They give all the flavor!
love it......YUMMY BREAKFAST....😋😋😋
i always made this with just patato flour and egg. it is delicious recipe
Im so freaking happy I found your channel when I did.
Proper comfort food, Indeed! YEAH! xo
Good idea adding raw podaydoes to the mashed ones! I'm going to try this. My husband loves podaydoe pancakes!
Those look so good! I so need to make these! Thank you for sharing!
Yum! I think these would go down a treat at the next family breakfast! Thanks for the recipe!
Overload cuteness haha
I'm more interested on your humor  it makes sense than your recipe just joking.
Much Love from #Philippines
Tosóimid!!!
6:11 Donal.exe stopped working
Love the video! The intro was beautiful
Love this format, Donal! Reminds me of when you were back in ireland filming in your red kitchen - cheers!
Big Bear!  Just south of me...I should have stopped in for boxty!  😂
You have to use what's on hand when on holiday. These look lovely. ❤ Thank you for the recipe!
u talk toooooo much dude for a cooking show ....!!!!!
You are a very beautiful human being ❤️❤️❤️❤️
haha the max interruption
Love everything about this video. You have a beautiful family
Obnoxious Donal = Best Donal
The first time we had Boxty was in Killarney, and we LOVED it. Ours had lamb curry on top 😲 I didn’t think about making it at home, thanks for the recipe!!
ThIS IS A MUST TRY!!! I'll let ya know how it turns out!! 😀😀
Pancakes!!!!!!!!!!!! That cabin looks cool!
"Andiamo" is an italian word ahah lol
What is "Let's go!" in Irish? :0c
in germany we would leave out the spring onion and eat it with apple puree
Probably thats a different way..
I have a salt problem too 😂😂🖐🏼
Lovely! Where did you learn how to cook so well?
These look so delish. They would be good with a side of applesauce and a side of gravy and some sliced tomatoes. Ummm  ummmmm good! Thanks for the good recipe.
Such a nice video, both food and view are amazing
Different from my grandads, but looks great. But you’re also in a heated home, so that’s different too. (Need to be from Ireland)
Hysterical!!
Question: You add baking powder (red tin), but you say baking soda.   Which one should it be?
I found King Edwards potatoes the best flavour.
Yay salt!
I think you meant baking POWDER not baking soda. I have the same can. The cheese is a brilliant addition!
Oooo I dunno if I'd add anything other than the fried eggs and bacon. That's a good enough combo, as-is.
Love it! Can’t wait to try it! Although it would be lunch time by the time I would finish doing them!
Yummy. 
I love it! 😍
This will be great for St. Patrick’s Day!
You failed gaelic you mean☺
My grandad used to make these for me when I was little, gonna have to give them a go
Not only do you need a masher, baby boy, you need a bigger mixing bowl!  ;)

Are they traditionally that pancake-like, rather than globs of potato with just enough batter to hold them together???  Never had boxty, so I'm wondering about the variations.  Thanks!
That looks awesome!
This is the best potato cake recipe I have ever seen!
I love these homey style videos!!
Those potato pancakes look amazing. I would likely have either sour cream or applesauce on them... (or even plain!)
If I were to make this (and I probably will), I would have a very hard time resisting adding a few eggs.   Does anyone know a good reason why I should resist harder?
I think Donal have met Niall as he saying potato potato
Looks delicious!
absolutely nothing wrong with a potato waffle. As an american now living in the UK, i eat one every morning with no regrets!
Lovely...
Not for me , cooked and raw potatoes . just puts me off . I rather , peel n dice them , boil them for 10 mins then deep fry them lovely chunks of potatoes , pop some cheese on top with your breakfast .
But I'm glad you Irish peps like them .
Going to try this tomorrow morning!
Love your videos!
What if I don't have butter milk😢😢
Amazing
Yummy......!!!!!! Looks really good.
Go hálainn Donal!
Howdy Donal!
Why do you bend over while talking? Please stand upright!
Cheers from 🇩🇪
bodaydo
technically Donal, they're whisked potatoes, not mashed ;)
Donalnpls go to philippines its close to malaysia the one thate like broken into pieces
“Bodado”
Love your recepies....
Wonderful video & cute babies💖
Yum!  Love the idea of adding mashed potatoes to the raw.  I grew up eating potato pancakes as a Lent tradition, and we ate them with applesauce or sour cream.  Yum yum!! :)
so... basically an irish hashbrown?
Yummy
Donal, I am SO glad you made this! I once went to a restaurant (now closed) and had the most delicious Boxty. I'd never heard of it before. That version was made from sweet potatoes... and was topped with chicken in a cream red ale sauce with leeks and mushrooms. It was DIVINE and I've been trying to recreate for years, to no avail. 😢😢😢
Love seeing the Bob's Red Mill bag as that's not too far down the road.  Now if only the boxty were actually in the kitchen!... time to cook! :)
Anyone else just watching these videos for Donal?
Драники (дируны) наши украинские сделал и гордиться ахахаха
Thanks, I haven't had boxty in years. I remember the rhyme my gran used to say about boxty. It went, 'Boxty on the griddle, Boxty in the pan, if you don't eat Boxty, you'll never be a man.' the other version, for the ladies - 'Boxty on the griddle, Boxty in the pan, if you can't cook Boxty, you'll never catch a man.' Somewhat sexist, but the rhyme has been around for centuries.
ive been on the hunt for potato pancake recipe my use to make theese all the time and they were so yummy but i forgot how she made them and she didnt get a chance to write it down for me before she passed away not long ago but it was just plain potato pancakes nothing else in them could you please suggest how she could have made them id be ever so grateful thanks
Is there a substitute for buttermilk? I live in Korea. They don't sell buttermilk here. 😿

I like potato pancake and I add the sugar a little in its. I will eat the potato pancake with sauce Korea's  style ; ingredients are soy sauce, lime/ lemon, chilli (slice), onion (slice), and spring onion (slice).
Pudaytoes
Ah yes, I always have left over bok choy at the bottom of my fridge. xD
You HAVE to make them drunk!!
Hi Donal, not bad at all, for a foreigner 😜
You can also use palm sugar instead of brown sugar, it makes it even better!
Thanks for sharing Thai recipes to the world 💓
Hey Donal is that Sofie's hands making the recipe
hi hi from Thailand, For the best flavor better not to add the veggie  which rich of water just to keep the spice taste
I love it ! Looks delicious. Thanks for another excellent dish
Yum looks delicious tell max that i love him sooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I really love this video setup
Everything is so properly shown 
Proper lighting, proper zoom, Proper angles
I absolutely love it 😍😍

Also if that's your kitchen, I'm jealous 😜
Handsome man, that knows how to cook and has a wonderful accent! What a prize you are! Lucky Sophie!!! 💞
I love it 😍😘🤗😋🤩 I need moore...plsss
Hi Donal, awesome recipe 👌🏻
Love frm india🤩🤩🤩🤩💗
We made this the other day and this dish is.... A M A Z I N G!  You only need 15 Min to put this dinner together und it's so so sooo yummie. Thank you for this recipe Donal
Why is it called drunken noodles?
💜❤💜❤💜❤
would it be incorrect to add grated ginger in the initial mix of garlic and chili?
I see! [When you're] Drunken Noodles.
Bom dia 👋👋👋
What are best chili options if I can't find bird's eye chilis?
So yummy loads of love from India
Wow that was so easy :) and it’s one of my favorites ones too :) como siempre muy buen vídeo 😘
I already have all the ingredients on hand! Definitely making this tonight and seeing if my roommate from Thailand approves Hahah 😂
OMG!! I'm so early❣️❣️❣️love you!!
Love from Thailandddd 🇹🇭
For a minute there I thought he said “bran sugar”, I was like “ where the hell am I gonna get that?!”🤣🤣
Loved it, thanks @donal_skehan
On my way 💪🏼 , Thank you for your delicious recipes !! I have to say that I got most of my English language and British accent learning from you ! Thank you again 💜
Way to complicated when I am drunk I have trouble opening my front door, let alone handling "screaming high heat"
I miss the part when you eat your dish after cooking!!! :)
Looking great Donal!
oh...no a lot of bok choy that not right
not much baby sweet corn
more chili and basil and dont forgot corn pepper......
these original testy spicy and salt becoz those reboot you after you drunk
Wow!! Nice to test. I must try it for sure.
โอ้ววว I'm from Thailand
can you cook also some Filipino food 😊
Get well soon, Sir 😄😄😄
No basil is a sin my friend
Looks tempting 😋 😋
Why are these called drunken?!
Gonna try it tonight!  I actually have all the ingredients in my fridge, including leftover bok choy which are on the top shelf of my fridge (I leave them there to remind me to use it asap).
Sooo goooooddd!!! By the way, wanna try creating your own versions of famous foods around the world? That would be a good content :)
Where's the booze I was promised?
Oh wow! That is incredible! I’m binging your videos after watching yours with Rosanna and I just love your family-esk personality and your dishes all look fantastic and mouth-watering delicious! Amazing work, Donal!!!
Drunken noodles? Oh honey those are just noodles
Cooked this tonight, great flavours and chilli kick. Easy to put together too.
Lovely flavor profile on this dish
Donal Senpai ^^
Why, may I ask, do you cut the bok choi on the "diagonal"?  After it's all cooked, does it taste better?  Visually, can you tell?  Or is it just presumptuous?
❤️
Yep
Great recipe! How can this be adapted for a vegetarian version?
Very nice and easy recipie! Can we make with chicken? We can youse any tyfe of noodles? Have a nice day!👍👏🍴
😇😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
1 more thing that you need is a bunch of young peppercorn for a little kick to make a drunken sober.
I thought it would have booze.  Disappointed here
One pan is made in one pan.. It is not mixes up in a bowl, nor a pestel...

You use the consept wrongly..
2:39 and 2:43 looks wayyy different. noodles look way darker later
I don't like this new style
Can we use chicken instead of pork ?
Much prefer it when we see you actually cooking rather than a VO... 🤔
Donal, we all love your big, fat, succulent meatballs.
Recipe and taste may be great, but this reminds me of a "Tasty" video. Meh.
The purpose of the vodka is that some aromatic compounds are only alcohol soluble, so the vodka helps extract those flavours. Then they are free to contribute to the complexity of the overall taste of the dish. Almost all of the alcohol is evaporated in the cooking process--that which remains is about the same amount as in a slice of yeast-risen bread as yeast converts sugars to carbon dioxide and alcohol. 
An easy substitute for the Andouille sausage might be chorizo, or you could mix up some Andouille spice with some ground pork. Andouille is a smoked Cajun sausage made with onions, garlic, cayenne or other hot chils, black pepper and usually thyme. Add some smoked paprika for the smoky flavor.
I haven't even had breakfast yet but I'm going to watch this anyways
The echo in the background is a bit strong. But this food looks good
Comfort food at its finest! 👌😋
Love the new Personal/Vlog style of videos, just one criticism; i’m not a fan of these trendy time-lapse videos of cooking.
Så gott!!! Kan du inte göra pasta pollo? Xoxo 🇸🇪
Donal, love the recipe. However, you left out one of the best parts, you tasting the food :-).
Hey donal....ur recipes are amazing ..my friend aditi shelke have great crush on you.. Plz reply her
Yum looks delicious oops just saw this now was sleeping tell max i love him soooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
Wow I need this in my life, aka belly, stat. Gotta cure this depression after all.
I love the way this vid was made. And I swear I'm trying this, yum :))
Penne alla Vodka!  I love this dish!
Italian is my ultimate comfort but I love rice and beans with a good thick tomato sauce on top. It's yummy, super cheap, and I normally always have all the ingredients at all times. I'd love to see your take on a rice and beans with tomato sauce recipe
I just love it. I am feeling hungry. It's just awesome.
wud up Donal.. mornin'!🌞🌄❄️🌨️🌥️
Looks awesome Donal! Like your new edits too.
Superb recipe Donal, love your presentation. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Hey Guys,


 I absolutely love your videos, You were inspiration to my new YouTube channel where I feature also Sous Vide videos - I’ve managed to upload some videos already by now but only one Sous Vide recipe: Pork Tenderloin with Beer Glaze.. If you have time go and see if I’m doing alright haha!  Let me know what you think - there’s more to come! 


It would be awesome to see you making experiment with different kind of burger patties someday :)))


Keep up the good work!


Cheers from Finland,


Mikko
Looks so good! This is perfect for all of the cold weather in LA lately. Definitely enjoy these recipes.
I love you (your food)
Camera work is stunning, and so is the food. Gj Donal!
Nice recipe !
Love it...make Moore...
Very nice always good stuff ..
Very nice ..always good stuff
Pasta / Italian is ALWAYS a comfort. This looks amazing! I'm gonna give this a try. I also always really love Fried Chicken (boneless, skinless) and Mashed Potatoes. Little is more comforting than that. Yummm.
😎 cool
Time to invest in a mic. That echoing isn't very nice.
Huh, vodka is best ingredient for most food))
It looks so freaking delicious!
Well dude, you decided what the gf wants for dinner lol.
I just woke up and watched this now I’m salivating 🤤
Love this easy Volga sauce......miammmmm!
You are awesome. I see your video at first on fox life in bengali dubbed. And you are the best blogger of my. I am 18 years old boy. I live in kolkata's rural area. And today I suddenly found your youtube channel. And happy to see your live cooking. And your stile ooooo man so good. I just love you খুব ভালো লাগলো।
That looks yummy
I love your recipes Donal but can you please recommend an alcoholic free substitute? I'm a recovering alcoholic and you're recommending that vodka should be introduced. You don't indicate otherwise....
It's that recipe i just looking for
Love this new editing style! Great video as always, Donal!
My favorite comfort food is macaroni and cheese
New style of video editing! Love it! Always love ur easy but tasty recipe!  But i wonder whose hand is that? LOL
Looks so good Donall! I’m gonna try it soon! Thanks!
Love your recipes!!!
What can we replace Vodka with if we dont drink alcohol ?
Nice dish donal but I need some Indian dish donal
Hi need some advice
My partner does not eat pork...since he saw YouTube about  it...anyway. what can I substitute with...
I was the 999th like!!! 🤩👍👌
Meatballlllllllllllllls
Dude.... The Audio....
You are amazing I am Arabic but I am so love basta

Isn't andouille cajun?
So good! Yum 😋
Yum!!!!
Donal I want to that you must try our Indian best dish biryani. Please make a video. এটা খুব ভালো।
great recipe!! will definitely give it a  try
I want to taste your juicy meatballs.
Great video!
Only one thing, there is a little bit of Ecco when you speak..
Gosh this looks so good
Thank you!
I liked the aerial view / rotation thing you did while you were editing, but maybe slow it down the speed of the rotation a bit next time? 😊 I felt nauseated halfway through and ended up having to look away for the rest of the video!
Looks good!
Very Lovely Food at Diet Succulent Meatballs!
go back to the way your older videos are made!
You need to do  brachiole.
Looks delicious!
Can we replace that sausage with another type? I mean an easier to find type in a regular supermarket.
I really like the faster paced cooking instructions! Great recipe, penne vodka is by far my favourite pasta!
Or-e-gan-o come on now Donal! 😊
Excellent
Could u please make some dessert
Looks soooo yummmmmy
Looks so good. I’m off dairy while I’m nursing my daughter. Pecorino (sheep’s) is ok instead of Parmesan. Is there a non-dairy alternative to buttermilk and cream that you’ve found that works?
Meatballs are in my comfort food repetoir. Thanks to the Irish roots from grandparents so are shepherd's pie and cabbage rolls. My father was also big on seafood and pasta so we were well rounded I guess.
I'm pretty sure andoullie is french
my comfort food is what my mum (and the woman she got the recipe off of) calls love soup. lemon + chicken + stock + rice + mint, makes the whole house smell like lemon (where the love comes in i suppose?) and really comforting, keeping it overnight means that most of the stock absorbs and it turns into a fairly lazy risotto on accident -- i couldnt imagine going winter without it
Hey Donal! Big fan of your recipes! Do you have an recommendations for an N'duja substitute? I'm from Singapore and I might struggle to find it here in our meat shops... Thanks!!
not so sure about combination pasta + bread
Love this recipe. But in place of vodka what we can use?
Could almost be a Thai recipe. Actually very similar to my last recipe.
Great informations there, good video as always. Thanks for sharing 😊
Have a Rice day :)
Can you make this recipe without the eggs?
(Vegan)
I am not a fan of fast motion video recipes but the final result looks yummy! 😋
Good morning! I'm here to see you prepare spicy fried rice! I love spicy dishes! Donal, I love your channel so much. Keep it spicy!
Its too early for breakfast but im so hungry rn by watching this
I'm hungry now 🤤🤤 it looks so good.
Sean Cody get on this!
I love all your one pan dishes! As a busy Mom those work best for me. I just subscribed and purchased your cookbook on Amazon. You're wonderful!
Greetings from the US!
One pan is my favorite way of cooking! Preferably long cooked. Like for hours! :D
I want to make this! I love those soy crumbles <3 What a genius duo the two of you are, this is one of the best collabs on YouTube. I just started working out and I find it hard to keep up with the foodpart, especially as a vegetarian, so these videos help me a lot!
Thats really nice and different!!I really love ur channel Donal
why are you using coconut oil for the fried rice .... Is there any pros for it... What is the health benefits of using coconut oil in the fried rice...
I was soo distracted with your dashing good looks! 🥰 what two good looking men and who cook nonetheless making them infinitely sexier!!!
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him sooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I really enjoyed this - I've been working out and eating much more healthily recently so I would love to see more healthy recipes on your channel! Could you do some healthier desserts and snacks? I've found loads of places to get healthy mains but I find that nice healthier desserts are hard to come by!
I'm hungry now 🤤🤤🤤
feeling happy when i heard that is taiwanese recipe
Hi Johnathan what’s your opinion on Keto Diet and OMAD (one meal a day ) ?
Looks amazingly delicious.
hi from México.  ❤❤❤
oh looks so yummy :)
Donal, do you notice a difference in the quality of the meat in the USA compared to Ireland?
This One-Pan Classic Spicy fried rice is so incredible and super fancy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will you make this for week-night meal or any crazy big parties ?
He is right, coz my parents too say the same, we should eat every food, coz every food has a different health benefits.
I love chopsticks
❤
love your one pan videos!!
Looks good!
How is this one pan??
I fell like I saw you IRL hmmmmmm
Nice collaboration Donal 👌
Starts at 2:15
Watching you cooking was better Donald... This kind of taping doesnt amuse me anymore 😕
Substitute that overpriced veggie protein with a delicious chicken fillet and we've already improved the recipe.
Nice dish donal but I asked some Indian dish donal
Yum
As registered dietitians, we have a very hard time combatting nutrition information spread by people like personal trainers that is not always accurate. I don't know the laws in Sweden, but at least in America nutritionists aren't necessarily certified to provide nutrition information to clients (some are future registered dietitians who have to go on to do their internship or take their exam). Also, on his website he calls himself a "nutritionalist", which isn't even a word. :/ Always better to take nutrition advice from a Registered Dietitian.
Lovely..😘😘😘
I don't like this new style with voice over and fast forward video footage.
Vegetarian blonde fitness trainer...aaaa cognitive dissonance
Love the taste of eggs and rice
As an asian , i am offended
I have that chilli plant in our backyard, have never ever used it, this looks delicious, should use them now...
are the eggs necessary in the recipe ? hope someone answers 🌑
I’m not a vegetarian, but I don’t eat meat every day either. I prefer real vegetarian dishes over dishes with some kind of “meat substitute”. All the substitutes I tried tasted horrible.
No offense but I'm a big advocate of calorie counting, and if you consume more than you spend a day it is just like accounting you got a net surplus of calories which your body tends to store as energy (fat). If you're trying to increase muscle mass change the ratio of carbs, protein, and fat you're eating a day. That's basically all I do. Plus soy is poison, it's full of xenoestrogens which have been linked with a number of female and male issues (not to be confused with pseudo chemicals like pseudovitamins like b12, sorry vegans can't get b12 from mushrooms or whatever, if you don't want to eat meat get a physician to prescribe you some b12 vitamin replacement).

Heavens ! You look like Hiccup from How To Train Your Dragon
I would never have thought you were in a boy band. Will you be sharing your music? 😂
Where did you purchase those glasses with the gold bottom from?
"....And we were in a boy band."  Colour me stunned.
Nice and great looking protein smoothies😋😋😋😋
Ive been wanting some smoothies
soo right on time
Nice smoothies donal I will try it you should try some Indian food donal and upload some Indian dish video
Thank you for including some alternative milk and banana free ones for lactose intolerant banana haters like me, who struggle with smoothies.
I really want to try this.
I love smoothies ♥️♥️♥️ ..........I'm gonna try all of them 😋😋
When Donal Was In The Boy Band He Looks Like Oliver James From What A Girl Wants And The Most From Raise Your Voice
Your recipes are always great 😘
0:52 is Jonathan possessed😱 or have u edited the pic😂
I've been scouring the Internet for good smoothie recipes the last few days
smug & virtuous. same! so funny
Love the smoothies!  I am always looking for something new.
You're the best, donal
Nice!
You two are so entertaining. I find myself smiling the whole time.
awweeee those glasses ♥️ lots of love!
Donal looks like hiccup in his teenage
Interesting video
3:20 btw, its lassssi😂
A must try, especially the supper green smoothie
Enjoyed the video! What would you suggest I sub for the mango 🥭? That is one of the only fruits I can’t stand the taste of. Thanks 👍🏻
Smoooothiiiiieeeees ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love your videos
What blender are you using?
People like me who have been following you since the beginning of your YouTube journey are well aware that you were in a boy band.. and you used to cook some delicious pad thai and chicken noodles for all..
I wonder...would that chocolate smoothie work if I substituted a small bit of coconut oil and PB2 for peanut butter?
i love this video so much, now i have more breakfast menu on my hand, thanks!!
I have to make the chocolate and peanut butter one...yum!
I know he's Irish cause his name's donal
Looks thirsty tell max i love him soooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I love it
Great vid but 2 Questions..... would cacao powder be ok instead of cacao nibs? And I don't have whey powder or anything is there a substitute or should I go out and buy some?  Thanks!😊😁
Please make sphagetti bolognese!
Anyone know the name of the song that is playing at 8.00min onwards??
What's the latest on coconut oil?! What have I missed?
I constantly make chocolatesmoothies which are quite balanced I think.
- 1 banana
- 1 scoop chocolate protein powder
- 2 table spoons of cocoa powder
- 1/2 avocado
- 1 cup milk/water/milk substitute 

And if you like you can add espresso, peanut butter, chocolate chips, anything that goes with chocolate really ;-)
too much talking and not enough shirtless johnny!
What can i put instead of banana if i'm allergic?
Wonderful stuff, but I'm waiting for your cover of some song or other. #HarpOnAboutTheBoyBand lololol
Greetings from Ireland, Donal, These look yummy, must try, as I love smoothies, I can only have bananas in smoothie form, yummy, yummy ,yummy, best smoothies I have seen on YouTube, and from a very good looking personal trainer, accompanied by a very good looking chef could these smoothies be the secret to eternal youth ha ha. 😀
These chatty videos are awesome! I can’t wait to try the green smoothie - looks like breakfast this week :D
May i ask? I know it's a stupid question, Since i am Indonesian who consume rice everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Will a glass of that smoothie gave as much energy as much as rice filled breakfast
What should I use to sub for the bananas?
I know most smoothies use bananas. Its there are good benefit for them or is it merely a textural thing. Im allergic to them and thus I have to stay away from them.
coconut oil, go keto, it's your best friend.
that looked really unhealthy
Love the new vlog style recipe videos with Max, Noah and Sofie!
"You had me at Ragu..."
Love this new format of video it’s fun and delightful. Love to see your lovely family and Max. I’m hungryyyyy
Oh boy , i wish i can ask your food to be my Valentine 😍😅
Ahhhh, baby no bib for the ragu ??? Oh well, never mind, that nice jumper instantly stained 😭
Hi Donal, great recipe, even the baby looked amazed 😍
Happy Valentine day, I didn't make any special video about it but I guess I will still prepare something special for my boyfriend... Shhhh don't tell him ! 😝
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him soooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I love the squelching sound that pasta makes as it's getting mixed into sauce...swoon😍
I really dig this new format! Feels nice and personal
Delicious recipe I would love to try it ❤
It looks de-li-cious!!! I wish I could come to your house and sit with you at the table! (And I admire your patience with Noah totally ruining his beautiful white pullover which will probably never be white again ... )
Who's here before the Italian army start complaining
Wee subtle tri colour homage to home there Donal with your celery, onion and carrot 🤩😂🇮🇪
With this recipe work with some cut lamb?
I also put some hot red chilis and a couple anchovy filets in there for extra flavor.
off the topic: You seem to be so positive and like a really great guy. I'm sure of it. Beautiful family also🥰
Love the bloopers at the end! Noah looks just like his mom!
I love this "Beef Ragu Pasta"...
I will make this at home in Valentine....
But I'm still single....
This looks delicious! I know what I’m doing for valentines ❤️ Also, I’m loving this video format - very fun, informative, and I love seeing more of your beautiful family!
Thank you for the recipe, I'd like to try it for the valentine's dinner with my partner.
Can you make a video on how to use stainless pan? It sticks every time when i use it.
I am proud you are videographing this on your own.
I won't be trying on VDay but definitely this Sunday for dinner. My family of 5 would enjoy this!
Mmmm, delicious.  not having my V-day stuff with my (first ever) Valentine until the weekend.  We are planning on meeting up at a museum and seeing the artworks collected therein.
Ut looks so Good 
I have your cookbook so
I  certanly gonna do that dish
And by the way your son looks amaysing  and so cute best of luck to YOU and Sofie
Hey Donal, great recipe! Definitely making this on sat for our valentines dinner 💕 But can I ask why you add milk along with the tomatoes, water etc? Is it for a specific reason?
your son is sooo cute, i cant take it 
just the cuteness 
lmfao i was not expecting that blooper, nice
Beautifully Done Donal.
too good gotta be Sunday dinner to share w family and friends 😋
Another awesome recipe. Thank you for sharing. You can never have too many recipes in your arsenal. I love everyday cooking and also like to share my own gluten free recipes too.
I subscribed because I liked the recipe and because he is handsome😃
this looks like such a beautiful comforting meal :) i like this new video set up!
This is great! I'll have to try this recipe. Can you make a slow cooker version? Keep the videos coming!
Making this today. I can't wait!
Like your channel and have learned from you a lot. Thanks 🙏
This looks just absolutely delicious! Must give it a try 🤩
So...donal fired his production team huh?
I usually see recipes use red wine, but this recipe uses white wine. Is there a reason to use white wine instead of red?  I don't mind using white. I am just curious if it really makes a different. Great recipe!
I don’t even like Valentine’s Day but this looks amazing Donal 😍
I see youve titled it to be safe from Italians. Well done Donal.
That looks amazing. Thanks for sharing !
Oh, look at that sweet wee man! He is growing like crazy. Give Max a pat for me. Have a fantastic Valentine's Day!
Donal!!! Lets see how you do lamb shanks
Oh my goodness that poor baby sweater :O Hopefully you were able to get those stains out lol! That meal looks absolutely delicious.
Let's be honest here.  Who else wishes it would be socially acceptable to grab an enormous string of ragu coated pasta in your hand and shove the entire noodle into your mouth?  No fork and spoon necessary.  No need to use a napkin, and it lightens the load on your dishwasher afterwards!  Win-win!
Good job, now you can talk about Italy
i like the new video style, it's definitely more engaging! i also like that you include your family which is just the cutest fam on earth!!
I wish YouTube came with wonka vision. I would reach in and enjoy a bowl of that. Awesome Donal.
4:05 nice catch there, doggo.
I’m gonna tell you a secret. That isn’t ragù. What you made is spezzatino, but pulled apart like a brasato!(equally good but different). They kind of have a similar recipe but ragù is made with minced beef and the taste is completely different. Normally ragù goes with pasta, spezzatino is enjoyed with polenta/bread. Next time you prepare it, try and make some fresh polenta. Prepare a big wooden cutting board and put polenta in the centre and spezzatino a around. Enjoy with friends directly from the cutting board. The polenta gets all the juices from the meat and it’s delicious. Hope it helps!
"Reeley broyoun"
Heyy donal... My friend has huge crush on u....aditi
Looks delicious.  Might have to try that one.
Don’t like the new camera style.
i wish someday I could cook like that omg
almeno qui hai imparato a far bollire la pasta, bravo dai
great recipe! just wondering if the wine is safe to serve for my little toddlers.
Ohohohogoho I AM SOOOO EARLY 😂
I am cooking this sunday!!!!
donal, who did your hairstyle?? loving baby noah enjoying delicious food!
Would this work in a slow cooker?
Baby eating pasta... how adorable! 😍🤗
I’m liking the more vlog style of videos lately
i really REALLY want to eat this right now!! cant wait to make it!! thanks for the recipe
can't wait to try this.  Noah is just precious eating his pasta!
Thanks, I just ate and now I’m hungry! Gonna try this one for sure.
That is a winner and I will be enjoying it this Valentine's.
I am here just to hear his accent
Sophie is hangry! Haha
Why cook in a pan instead of the oven or slow cooker?
Could you do the 2hours in a crock pot
Looks Delicious ❤
Tiny fists full of pasta haha.
0:12 Donal, in your line of business you really should know the difference between tagliatelle and tagliatelle.
I love your sign offs with eating with your family.  They enjoy the meal, you're happy while eating it, and the little one OBVIOUSLY loves it (as he almost literally inhales that pasta strand)...
Looks amazing!
Looks amazing!
The bitly link to the recipe is broken.
Ooh looks so delicious <3 this beef ragu its amazing! N' that baby is so yummy too...
He is handsome
And why use milk ?
I don't have the ingredients for this, so I can't make it yet. BUT... I have a feeling when I do, this will be one of my favorite dishes EVER! Nothing beats a hearty red sauce and pasta! 😋😋😋😋
Me encantan tus video 😍 love  your videos
What a pleasant coincidence. Tagliatelle and beef happen to be on my shopping list.
Great video once again. So enjoy the new way of filming.
It seems delicious, but it isn't called Ragù. It's like 'Spezzatino' and in Italy we don't eat it with pasta, but it might work aswell. 
Firstly, Ragù meat is a mixture of many types of meat and it's always minced meat.
Secondly, traditional Ragù needs two or more hours of low heat cooking, but you can still make "fast Ragù" without spending hours and hours of your life.
This looks the bom..😋
Yum look delicious but would you please speak a little slower
I don't really eat meat but this does look delicious!
Hope my girlfriend loves this today for a diner. Looks SO good
You should've put a big on Noah so his jumper doesn't get ruined.
Love you cookings .....
Are you recording yourself this time? I’ve noticed you had a camera person before ?
I am from India OMG after chopping the vegetables it looked like our tri coloured Indian flag 🙂am I the only one who thought this?🤔love ragu nd the chief...from India
Hope that there isnt problem once every two weeks.
Looks delicious!
the new born ons is onfuse about .. not happy to be here

That looks ridiculously good. I can't wait to try this recipe out.

Any suggestions on how to add alittle bit of heat to it? I'm a sucker for spice.
can i use red wine instead of white???
Love it.
Looks amazing!  Didn't make it for Valentine's Day, but I'm making it for our Sunday Family Birthday Celebration.  My husband & mother-in-law have February birthdays just days apart, so we're celebrating this weekend with this meal!  Thank you for this recipe.  Perfect timing!
Nice donal
Lovely video! :D
Love the recepie,,the baby eating great food,will make this for my 2 year old grandson!(and me ) Born in Ireland living in Canada.Thanks🇨🇦🇬🇧
change jobs. or at least first read cookbooks. if you have to cook Italian, please do it well. the ragù in Italy is made in this way: put the oil EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE in the pot, fry the onion, when it is golden, add the sausage and minced meat, cook the meat well, add a glass of white wine, make evaporate the wine, add the peeled tomato, add chopped carrot celery rosemary and sage, add two leaves of laurel and it will come a fabulous ragù
You should do braciole.
Nice... Make this stew with oxtail... That could be great!
Awesome.
We have very different definitions of "generous" when it comes to black pepper.  I would have palmed it!  ;-)
Hmm dont have white whine what could replace it? This looks amazing ♡
Every time I make braised beef, the meat comes out tough... Any suggestions on how to fix this?
That is not ragu but spezzatino. And pasta with spezzatino DOESN'T exist.
Donal, at 3.20 you mention a half-filled can of tomatoes - is it water you've added or more tomatoes. It's not clear . . . . . . .
What’s the cut of meat called?
Clicked as soon as you saw
But I'm a vegetarian
So ughh
I always wonder how much alcohol actually vaporizes once it Hits the pan. I heard there is always alcohol left which make me not wanna cook this for my babies....
I tried...not best..Quang's beef ragu pasta recipe is still the best i ever tried..
No way!!! This is an absolute dream. A BLT salad?!##$? I'm totally shook right now in the best way possible. Donal, thanks for sharing all your wonderful recipes with us. YUM!
I can almost taste these beautifully roasted tomatoes and the gorgeous blue cheese sauce through the screen :D
I like the idea of roasting the tomatoes esp when they are out of season. Looks delicious.
If I may offer a bacon cooking tip, since you have the oven already at 400F/200C, put the bacon on a sheet pan and cook it in the oven for 17-22 minutes. You don't even have to turn it and no splatters on camera lenses or all over your range. Brilliant tip on the tomatoes--especially for the sad winter tomatoes the roasting brings out flavours that otherwise would not be there.
Hi Donal, i am your big fan and i was surprise (maybe bit late) after read an upfront article in a business magazine that you are the chef for virgin atlantic, develop new sets of menu for upperclass and following other classes in next year..looking forward for it :)
Hahah kinda cute how your family is in the background like “honey I have errands to do” hahaha lovely 😊
I love all ur recipes u never made them hard .... lots of love to you from bangladesh
Loving your recipes soo realistic and achievable unlike lots of others..thankypu 💓
Hi donal I'm a big big fan of you.❤❤❤❤❤😍😍 I love your channel can't wait to try this recipe. 😍😍😍😍
This salad looks amazing! Definitely going to make it this weekend.
Added avocado to make a BLAT & lightly tossed the lettuce before drizzling one desired amount per person.
Oh man. That looks mouth-wateringly fantastic. Yum yum yum!
Love this more informal style of filming :)
Thanks for another great idea! I would prefer the T raw but other than that it's excellent!
What if I don't like blue cheese dressing??? 
What can I do?
Great video! Sometimes we just need a bit of those basic food tips. And now I'm hungry. Ha ha.
I love this cooking/vlogging thing! It's brilliant!
I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, what other dressing  or sauce would you recommend for this salad? By the way, we were drooling while watching the video! Brilliant!
Tasty looking recipe.  I'll try this.
Dude when in the UK you really REALLY should check out the TomatoStall produce. Amazing fruit and a heavenly Oak Roasted Tomato Balsamic.. It's a killer. All grown on the sunny Isle of Wight. ☀️🍅.
Cheers.. Lovin your work.
I LOVE  Donal !!!

I love the sound of sizzling bacons.... yummm🥓🥓😋
Love this salad... except the blue cheese, which I'd replace with something I like. :) Yum!
It's always fun to toss the salad!
Lately I have Beef Bacon on my mind...
Love anything BLT!!

Looks delicious!
Thanx, that was cool.
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘

Yum! I have so been into blue cheese lately. I also put a touch of celery seed in the dressing too.
Washing lettuce is for girls
Washing lettuce is for girls
I still don't own an oven and would like to try this recipe, any suggestions to make the tomatoes and lettuce? :)
Delicious!!!
Hmmm looks delicious
Looks good. I like the idea of the different variety of tomatoes.
Yummy 😋
👍👍👍
yaaaay again the first comment! lots of love from India♥️ I hope Noah is doing well!
Not toasting that bread in the bacon fat is a sin. Otherwise, looks bloody amazing!
How is that bacon Donal? I moved half way across the world to get to the UK for the bacon, just wondering if the US bacon is as good.
Looks like red leaf lettuce not romaine.
Your so sexy and such a good cook 👨‍🍳
What else can I use besides the bacon?? Cause I can’t eat the bacon !😊

Love from India !! Amazing recipe 💯😍
LOVE IT...🍗🍗🍗😋😍🤩 YUM YUM YUM....
I was just wondering how long could I marinate the chicken for before I cook it?. So I could take it out the fridge after work and cook it. Such a great recipe.
Donal, May I ask what type of grill is that? Did you purchase from Amazon?
This recipe was legit amazing. Nice one Donal!
Come on Donal!! Road to one million..so close!
Hey Donald new subscriber, you should try to make karaage chicken I love to see your twist on the recipe, keep the good recipes coming, you've got a new fan mate, best wishes from Manchester :D
simply splendid sauces
I'm a big fan of yours .. I like your recipes a lot . Following you since your show in Italy with nona's
can't be churrasco off the charcoal or wood open fire. on a griddle it is NOT churrasco.
This thumbnail 🤤🤤🤤
Man i love Your recipes. So simple and delicious tried a few and they were sooo good. Thanks man
Can't wait to try it.......it looks so delicious 😋😋
Wonderful recipe! I substituted the chicken for fresh squirrel.. wonderful with that lemon zest :)
Have to laugh at your name. I have an uncle Donal been married 55 years and his wife still can’t say it. She calls him Don. That’s ok, my name (Deirdre) is also hard for Americans.
this is amazing,  greetings from Colombia
I love your shirt 👕 you are very entertaining.
Wow!!!  This looks so beyond next level delicious!!
This looks amazing! Time for dinner. 😊 I decorate cakes on my channel.
this sounds amazing
I saw you on the tv and directly google your name and found this!
Hello,Donald.I'm from Bangladesh.🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Thing of beauty ❤️
DO MORE CHICKEN RECIPES 🍗🍗🍗
What time do you want us for dinner? 😀😀
Definitely gonna try this! It gives me a feel of summer bbq 😃
Beautiful man 😍
Oh my god..while u start preparing the dish,my mouth started to water..want to taste it.!!😋
This chicken recipe is so incredible and super duper  fancy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
looking delicious!!
I always thought churrasco was Portuguese judging from all the Portuguese barbecue restaurants that sell it!
this reminds me a lot of peri peri chicken. can you use coriander instead of parsley in the chimichurri sauce or do you think it will be too strong?
You are the best
Masha Allah amazing dish 👍
Could you add soy sauce to the marinade?
droolinggg just by looking at it .. PSA: dont mix the chicken with ur hands, bad idea cos theres chilli in the marinade
Now there is a man who can handle a pestle...
It looks so yummy 🤤
Really spice thanks.
Please add more videos
I don’t want your kitchen! But I would love you to cook for me in my kitchen .
Mouth watering😋
Being from Chile I´ve never heard the term churrasco when it comes to chicken, to us is just grilled beef, but this recipe looks BADASS! I´m totally going to try it with some fries on the side. Thankssssssssss a lot!
Another chicken to do on my list looks so yummy but is there any alternative for red wine vinegar
You can look up a recipe for gumbo the best for youtube very soon thanks and also New Orleans bread pudding thanks
What's a good substitute for red wine vinegar?
' i love mine nice and spicy ' add only 3 chillies. as an avid chili eater that's mild for me :)
Looks delicious
You’re a gem Donal! I can safely say that I am by far the worst chef on the planet but I tried ur raspberry scones and oh my goodness they’re so delicious!
Yummy. Can't wait to make this!
❤️💙💜
Yummilicious :)
Why is it always sunny outside your kitchen?
Feel disappointed that you didn’t get your hands in there and properly marinade the chicken!
Great recipe
Lütfen açıklama kısmına malzemeleri yazar mısınız??
That is nothing like the chimichurri as we know it in Argentina. I’d love to try this other thing anyway!
yum
Can you make gumbo it’s so good thanks
Looks like it was taped in the summer
Yum looks delicious tell max i love him soooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
I know that was skin on, but was it boneless, the website didn’t say? Love delicious, can’t wait to give it a try.
sorry if i seem to be rude but as an indian the act that you have added only 3 very little chilies and have said that you like it specie is funny and ironic.
Hey guys! Let me know if you want more quick cooking weeknight suppers!
I'm pretty sure he used 2 pans!!!!! ;)
3 cloves of garlic is not heavy 😂😂😂 at least for me
I dont understand why you added the sauce so quick... Let the chick actually brown first for a lot more flavour
"3 cloves of garlic,you have to be heavy with a garlic"
As a Hungarian i can say we do not use less than 5 for any kind of food and the heavy starts around 15 :D But nice recepie :)
Yes pls more easy quick wkly supper meal's ty.😉
Lots more like these  please Donal. Looks epic and very easy/cheap to do after a very busy days graft on site. 👌🏻
Thank you for sharing Donal that look so delicious definitely will be trying it😎👍🏼🍗🥦
U are amazing Donal. Tried this and it was fantastic. Give us more of such recipes
Yessss honey & garlic is the best combination!
May I know where'd you get your pan from? it's so gorgeous!
I wonder if adding ginger would add another dimension to it? I have started adding ginger with garlic in stir-fries and curries, I wonder if it would work here too . . . . .
Do I have to use apple cider vinegar or could I use something else/similar?
i only watch your video's coz i like the sound of your voice lol
U could have brown the chicken skin first..then the sauce..I do that way.
Just saying..
Soggy skin hmmm ill pass
brown the skin first without the marinade then add. Yor welcome
your'e a lifesaver Donal! I have my family coming over tomorrow and this the just the recipe i needed. Thank you, I'll let you know how it goes!!
That's my favorite meal by my favorite chef ♥️😍
Made this tonight. It is now going to be one of my favourite meals to make packed full of flavour, tender pieces of chicken and full of that veggie goodness!!. Thanks Donal for this one.
I soooooo want to try this😻
Of course,  gonna use it for my next week prep,  big thnx ♥
Loved the music in the background! Looks delicious, I'll try it soon!
Wow I love this recipe I’ll surely use it in the future!
Was gonna make this tonight but I used all my soy sauce
It comes close to a Chicken Adobo recipe! I gotta try this!
This is easy to make. Ingredients easily available. Looks delicious. All checked... OK now I'm hungry 👍
would substituting coconut aminos for soy sauce work in this recipe? thanks
looks amazing would sure love to try this one
maybe you can marinate first, so the sauce will observe till inside the meat. looks good though, thank you :)
Great recipe for a weeknight with some Cooked brown rice thanks Donal
Can't wait to try it . Looks delicious 😍😍
hi donal from canada me and my 5yr old daughter love u ur awesome and have tried ur recipes and definitely going to try this one , yum!
I'll do this with way more seasoning cus I'm Puerto Rican haha

you said at the start that cooking it all in one pan gives you crispy chicken but you practically steamed the chicken
Yeeeyy for easy weekday dinner!😍
Definitely will try this recipe later!
Is there an alternative I could use for the Apple cider vinegar, would love to make this tonight but it's the only ingredient I don't have. Thankyou!
Thanks love your cooking

Looks delicious!love from India.
Made this an hour ago for dinner and it was great. Thank you, Donal. Wouldn’t be able to cook if it weren’t for you.
Hey love the recipe! Btw are you Irish?
hi this looks really good and the second pan was only used as a lid
can’t wait to try this out with tofu! seems like it would work perfectly!
Looks delicious.. Going to definately give it a try. Thanks 😊
Almost same as teriyaki,, Love that veggies got added though
Hi Donal. I'm not a huge fan of coriander. What would you recommend replacing it with?
Can't wait to try it...... looks so tempting 😋😋
That’s clearly 2 pans...
Chicken dinner winner dinner chicken

Hi, your recipes are divinely inspired from Heaven.  I will make this!  Good-bye veganism! Thanks for the great tips!
Looks as yum as the cook.
Yum!!!👌👌
You make it look so easy! This is nice :)
I made it just now and it’s great! The flavors really work well together and the vegetables are nice and crunchy. The meal was overall light yet filling. Definitely going to make again! Thank you Donal for a simple and healthy dinner recipe :)
Looks good!
I have made this two times in two weeks now!. YUM!
Donal, Can this dish can be done in a slowcooker?
Soooooo handsome ☺️
Chicken winner chicken dinner
I LOVE CHIKEN AND GARLIC SEPERATELY. BUT YOU HAVE FUSED IT INTO A BEAUTIFUL COMBO DISH ..... I LOVE IT A LOT ..😋🍗🍗
Can we use chicken breast instead?
One question, if I leave the chicken over night inside the sauce, is it better? or it doesn't change anything?
Looks good, going to make!!
Why do you not make the video the same as the written recipe?
Good mornin' Donal! I'm having fried chicken, mashed potatoes and corn on the cob for breakfast..
He let out the magic.
I love chicken recipes which  are  can be prepare before  I go to work and cook when I get home from work. I definitely would be giving this a try tomorrow. After I've been shopping.
I'm going to try this recipe with tofu instead of chicken, because it sounds delicious and all those flavours go well with tofu . Not sure if I would need the apple cider vinegar though.. ?
YUM - looks amazing ....
Donal, I love you but this chicken really needed some seasoning
This looks so so yummy! 🤩
I love cooking. Doing my research on Maldivian food. Soon hoping to bring you some traditional food of maldives through my channel.  :)
Hye there! The recipe is quite simple and I think I want to make it but  I want to replace the chicken with beef. If I do so, is the portion is still the same or I need to add the seasonings a lil bit more?
making this tonight!! Cant wait!!
Look delicious 😋
Going to make this either today or tomorrow!
😋
Donal u should try to do Master Chef. I’m sure you would win!!
Mahal kita😄
Looks SOOOOO DELICIOUS ! 😊👏
جلبانة  امالها 😳😳😳😳🙄
Love the recipe, made it and it tasted delicious!  However in the written recipe you left out the bit about adding the splash of water and covering with a lid for the final cooking time.  Please add that in because if I hadn't watched the video first I don't think it would have turned out right
Whats up with the new camera? Sorry, but I don't like it.
Yum looks delicious i am making this soon can make this to low carb and vegan started on 20 November 2018 onwards tell max i love him soooooooooooo much and i say hi to him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
Hi Donal, Firstly are those chicken thighs bone in or out? I've checked the recipe but it doesn't say and it's hard to tell in the video. And also is Apple cider vinegar the same as the cider vinegar we get here in the UK ? . Thanks x
Yummy! Just idea, adding thin slice of ginger and put half green onion earlier would works more flavor and stirred along with garlic. I do agree browning the chicken a bit sounds fantastic. Sometimes I do similar dish in chinese-style.
Love it. Since I'm vegetarian, i replaced the chicken with tofu and added a bit of mushroom. But still tasted just as delicious. Loved the sauce. Will try with soy leg pieces next time! 😁
No
Adobo
What knife are you using to chop the vegetables?
This looks amazing and what would you eat this with? I was thinking sweet potato chips 😋 I always have to have something on the side haha
First comment?
Can people with diabetics eat this? which ingredients to replace if not?
Honey, garlic and chicken, three words that are key to getting me salivating for a main dish at a meal.  And all of the vegetables you used are so delicious when prepared in Eastern style marinades.
can I use beef instead of chicken? can I use cauliflower instead of brocolli? can I use green beans instead of sugar peas
I’m making it tonight!
Im allergic to soy, do you know any replacement?
This looks so delicious! I love fast and easy food. Thank you so much for the recipe. 😊 

I'm also a YouTuber with a bilingual cake channel and would love any support.
ohhh THIS I CAN DO!! My fellow students living in small dorms, this one can be done!! enough with cup noodles!! TODAY I SHALL FEAST LIKE A KING!   thank you, donal :D  oh, I love being alive, don't you feel the same guys?
Something different about Donal...... Too much make-up :/
Hi donal~lovely recipe! But I don't like chicken thighs and I really don't like broccoli,  can I use chicken breasts and what can I use instead of broccoli? Thank you so much ^^
I wish I get a husband who can cook for me. I am too lazy for it 😂🙈
🙄 but you used two pan 🍳🍳
Too much salt
This looks sooo delicious!
And that's the cutest little family ever! 😭❤️
My favorite pasta dish. My mom makes the best! One thing we always do in my family is to saute a clove or two of sliced garlic in some olive oil and "top" the finished pasta with a bit of sizzling garlic oil...cause who doesn't want even more garlic?...lol! Yum!
I am sure we are gonna have angry italians in the comments
Omg noah is sooo cute ill die
I love the vibrant flavours in a white pasta sauce, wine chilli oil. yum. Just like my dad makes on the beach
Dopo tutti i video di cucina italiana ancora non hai imparato a cuocere la pasta?? Se li facevi a bagno Maria venivano meglio..
Beautiful pasta and beautiful family! I can’t wait to give this dish a go. I’ve never cooked clams before but this looks a lovely place to start.
Come...India...man...huge fan...hope we will meet...✌️
I really don't like clams, but just watching this video because of your great energy (and lovely family)! Keep it up
OMG...I had to watch this because you had me at "spaghetti".  YUM!!!
The cutest family I've ever witnessed .... Respect for you Donal 👍🏾
We need to see more of Noah in your episodes! Love that baby!
This makes me smile! So cute. And the food looks good too!
Allergic to seafood but I watched anyway 😆 ! Great video Donal!
I love the family time videos!!! ❤❤❤
I loved this vide, greetings from Colombia 🇨🇴
I always make your dishes but without the chilli flakes!
There's Sofie, Noah and Maxie. The Skehan family is together and going to have pasta. I want to be a part of this family squish. Thanks again for a wonderful recipe Donal. 💕💕🍜🐾🐾🐾
Such a cute person you are❤
Nice to see your lovely family.
Yes very good as well :) I guess you got a lot of bad comments from my fellow Italians because of the one-pot ... the other stuff you do looks authentic enough for me :)
You need a bigger Pasta Pot mate. But I love this recipe - delicious J
Cheers
Done this, but I like to start with pancetta and onions first. Everything else the same. Sometimes add tomatoes. Depends on the day.
You have a Beautiful family.
Great Dish ... 👍 Beautiful family ...
adorable family!!
You have such a beautiful family😊 may lord protect y’all from evil eyes.
You had the samo food every night? Unbelievabol!
Great from America 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Clams are not for me but, still fun watching Donal do his thing...
This is one of my favorite pasta dishes! I definitely want to try this version of it!
I absolutely love your videos especially the banoffee pie
My mouth is watering........ I'll try it soon 🤤🤤😋😋
You have the most beautiful family, Donal. And your cooking is sublime. 

My grandfather used to make something similar to this, but he took the clams out of the shell after they opened and served the clams in the garlic sauce over the pasta. ❤️
Oof. Looks good! 😋
Hi Donal! Love your videos! They are so easy to follow and really encouraging! Mmm. Can I use any kind of white wine for this? I don’t drink. Not sure if type of wine matters. Thanks.
so beautiful
looks delish .. sup Donal,😀👋
Bro you need to try some Indian cuisine....
Really appreciate for showing us your cute family..ur love for food and family is so pure.. god bless u n ur family
This Spaghetti Alle Vongole is so incredible and super  fancy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing, Donal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hy very nice👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹
Looks delicious. I also scared with clams because of the sand.
what a beautiful family ❤️
Nice resepey I going to try
Woody Allen, Jim Carrey, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis are beginners. You are the King.
Your wife looks like Olivia Colman.
Your wife and daughter are adorable!
Too small pot! Pasta needs to swim!
Yummmm Italians here is a better version
جميل جدا أن شاء الله اجربه وانت رائع جدا
Your family ❤️💕💕!
different kitchen?
Y'all are the cutest!! And the pasta looks great, it's a popular dish in my house 😋
Fantastic! Hahahahaha that end!!! Noah, Noah
Garlic wine vongole that’s it fantastico!!!!
Saved
I just eat this with my eyes nice
Masked singer?
Cue the angry Italians.
noah's onesie is psychedelic
Noah so adorable x
Beautiful family
As a little worried about the baby eating the pasta because there was red chili flakes in it
Bravo per il condimento ma sulla pasta non ci siamo. Gli spaghetti hanno un tempo di cottura intorno ai 4 e 5 minuti e gli devi mettere nell'acqua quando bolle e metterci un po' di sale grosso
It looks delicious😋
Very nice! Thank you!
Good job
I have never tried clams, I love mussels though,  how would u describe the difference in their taste?
Can you please cook pasta sardines with lemon and wine? Because I have been cooking for my own lunch at the office.
Uwielbiam makaron z muszlami!
Namnam
What is the substitutes of wine
Hey 😊 any substitute for white wine?
Yum looks delicious i am making this soon can make this to low carb and vegan as am low carb and vegan started on 20 November 2018 onwards tell max i love him sooooooo much and i say hi to him my focus is on him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
VONGOLE PASTA ONE DISH
So why is it that we don’t eat dead clams? I feel like clams in other processed applications (canned, etc) could probably be dead for a lot longer before ingested. 
Or is it that these clams we don’t know how long they’ve been dead? Just feel it’s a waste lol
Please!!!! Can anyone share tips on how to clean mussels & clams of all the sand!?!?  No matter how I clean them I still end up with a sandy dish & it ruins everything!!! The trick Donel gave on letting them sit in a big bowl of water never works for me.
Watching you booling "PASTA" I ask WHY ? DO YOU/ANYBODY needs to brake pasta to cook/boil it ????????????!!!!!!!!   COOKING IS an ART/PASSION @the simplest times !!! Enjoy COOKING Enjoy FOOD !!! TO YOUR HEALTH !!! 😋🍹
is there any substitute for white wine? because I don't use alcohol. thanks!
Looks yummy for the tummy! What would you suggest as a halal substitute to the white wine? Will grape juice do the trick? Thanks
If you want to try the best version of this in Italy,come to Bari!Anyway good job,you made me hungry ahahahah Ciao
Adding a bunch of garlic and ginger to the mirepoix  will help if you are feeling poorly.  Thanks, Donal!
I'm an old school kinda lady and I make my chicken soup by boiling whole chickens and all that. BUT this seems like a tasty quick soup if I ever don't feel like doing it my usual way. Also a nice tip to keep your noodles from getting too done is to cook them separately from the soup and then add them to each bowl as you eat it. That way the noodles won't continue soaking up the broth and end up mushy. I also store the noodles separate from the soup. That way you're always getting al dente noodles with each bowl.
Not a big fan of chicken, but your attitude is so refreshing...
Red Thai Curry stew is mine. It's super simple, this is how I learned it in five-star restaurants: 

In a pan add Extra Virgin Olive oil and grate in a head of garlic, once that's making noise add 1.5 tablespoons of quality Red Thai Curry Paste, right before it burns add cookable greens to cool things down (brussel sprouts, Nappa cabbage, bok or yu choy), chillies, and a tablespoon of quality peanut butter. Then add citrus of any kind, milk (preferably Coconut but Cashew, and Homogenized cows milk work too), then a little water, whatever main protein you want, and finish with basil. I serve that on a cup of rice. 

When it's cold as a mf outside or I'm feeling ill I whip this up, it cooks in half an hour.
I must admit it's good old fashioned broth. Full of barley and other pulses steaming hot and a great big bowl with crusty bread add butter. It is my childhood in a bowl. To this day I still have broth in the freezer at all times. It is for days when you're feeling ill, sofa days what it's cold outside or days or you just want some comfort. It's just a big hug in a bowl.
Donal, can you go out on a limb and recommend a chicken stock by brand name? 
The choices have become way more varied in the last few years but I can't say any ever really measure up to my homemade. I make it with the intention of freezing but it tastes so good I eat it all and it never makes it to the freezer.
What did you use for Chicken Broth/Stock...What is the difference between Broth and Stock?
"This might not win any instagram likes..." THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP I'VE SEEN IN MY LIFE. Trying it out tonight. Thank you Donal! Another excellent recipe.
A fantastic video and a great and simple recipe, have to try that now, healthy people can get on it, too.  :).  Keep up the good work man!
This is such a beautiful and rustic chicken noodle soup recipe. Easy and perfect. Now, the question is... you feeling better yet, Donal? Get well soon. ❤
This is the ultimate comfort food, great video well done! 😋
Making me hungry! My Mom is making chicken noodle soup for dinner tonight!
I like to make vegetable soup with dried porcini mushrooms and smoked paprika. Smells and tastes divine.
Just when I was thinking which soup for dinner !!!!! Big thumbs up..
All the way from Saudi Arabia 👍🏼
Seriously comfort food👍🏻 bowl full of goodness🌟😇🌸
I absolutely love the passion you have for cooking it is so prominent in every video. Also love the comforting food recipes that are quick and easy to make.
I love Chicken Noddle Soup.....I will try this in my home...
Conchigile(sea shell shaped pasta) would be a great alternative for the noodle aspect of the dish!
Perfect as we are having temperatures in the low 20’s degrees here in Delaware USA with a couple inch’s of snow. Soups on the menu 😊. Had to laugh 🤔 how many times I’ve had to change to a bigger pot in my lifetime of cooking yes it happens
Ultimate comfort food.....🍲🍲 chicken soup it's usually Sunday's lunch menu in my house....simple delicious....😋😋
Looks delicious! Will surely give this a try. ☺️
I will try this this week. thanks for all your videos
First and luv ur VIDEO
1:40 love when chicken breast takes flavor from the chicken:D
Looks delicious perfect meal for a rainy winter night
So simple and it looks SO GOOD!
Hopefully you were able to have this wonderful soup on hand when you had your ‘man flu!’ 😄
Now I’m so hungry 😭😍😍
Looks good, I don't like soup, only the meat from the soup and ramen noodle soup. 🙈
the best cooking channel.
Quick and easy soup is perfect on days when you just can't be arsed doing anything. Looks delicious.
That looks sofa king easy to make!! Amazing!
Looks tempting 😋😋 love ua videos....😊😊
This is the missing ingredient my soul needed
I have soup and salad almost everyday.  Can't wait to try it! Thanks so much for sharing!
Looks amazing. I think i will cook this tomorrow.
When it comes to comfort food & soup for those cold winter days, or when I'm not feeling well...it's mom's chicken soup avgolemono (it's a greek recipe that calls for shredded chicken & rice and then eggs, lemon& some of the broth whipped together and added to the soup...makes the soup look like it's covered in a cloud! 😊) There is truly nothing better! 💛
Donal, vet du var man får tag i såna nudlar i Sverige? Du är så duktig!
I LOVE that first pot! Must have... two, one for momma (me) and one for Kid 2 in Vermont.
WOW!! 😋

Looks so good!!
I've been wanting to cook noodles but didn't know how until now

Can I cook it without the meat?
Perfect for winter evening
OK now I'm hungry yeah. Looks yummy...
What is the contraption you are cooking on? I know it is a heating element, but what is the brand name?
Too much seasoning
Just ate but now your making me hungry again.
Looks good! 😋
My soup today, green lentils, miso, carrots,onion, brocolli, turmeric,chilli flakes and garlic, delicious
Chili next!!!
Is that store bought stock or homemade? It is so dark, I just wonder why it is so dark :/. I made chicken soup with chicken bones and the stock is so clear.
Fantastico!!!
I find all brands of stock to taste like rubbish. Make your own from chicken carcasses.
Donallll love your videos
Yum Donal.
This looks so gooood
That looks yummy ❤️😊
pls support me...
You can also just bring the stock to the boil after you add the chicken, turn off the burner and let them sit in the hot stock for 12-15 minutes.  You'll get much more tender chicken perfectly cooked through. You could even use some for chicken salad.   Cheers.
Marshmallow cake.
Not how I would do it, I would as others here, boil a whole chicken and so forth, but this is a nice and easy way.
Please post new videos
wow nice...
Hi,  I cant stand cooked celery , what can I use instead of  or can I just leave it out all together? Thank u 🙂
Donal can you please link the burner you’re using? Thanks!!!
Does he ever read comments???
Can we customise the veggies?
nice
I’m surprised you added the noodles to the stock. I like a lite stock...I don’t want all that starch in my stock.  If not eaten all at once or even within an hour those noodles will soak up all the stock and become swollen and gummy...Donal...I’m shocked LOL
In my country you can’t buy broth or stock in grocery stores.. we make soups from scratch. Every soup looks delecious you make Donal (and other fav yt chefs) and I’d really like to make them but with only water it’s so bland :(
🇹🇷 Türkiye den sevgiler 👍 🤗 🇹🇷
Oooh you speak so much
Just made the soup your way, and I just altered a slight bit by adding some vodka to season the raw chicken breast.  Absolutely delicious! Simple and good!
Looks great! You need to chew better it’s better for you 🥂
I’m surprised Potatoes cook quicker then Pasta?
I'm always afraid of the comment section when Donal cooks italian style food. Looks delicious.
I never buy pesto from the shelf, I always make my own. But I found the prices for pine nuts too high and tried walnuts, not only do they cost close to nothing, they also taste way better.
Classic...I always add a bit of fresh lemon juice or zest to my pesto.  Not classic and not enough that you can taste it, but it definitely makes it more vibrant tasting
p'daidos
I like how he says "potatoes".
'Two cloves of garlic'
Filthy casual
I love how you say potatoes. “Po-day-dos” Lol Irish accents are my favorite! Awesome recipe as well
any link to the recipe with exact amounts etc.?
I always leave out the parmesan from the mix because the culture from the cheese actually makes the pesto sauce expire faster, and my mom and I are very small eaters. If I want the cheese, I will just add them later. Also, since there's no easy way to find pine nuts where I live, almonds work great too. I also put in 4 cloves of garlic because we like it strong in this house lol
My daughter and I made it today, it is delicious!
Thank you Chef Skehan, greetings from Mexico City!
Hi Donal- thnx for sharing this amazing recipe Pesto Pasta is my all time favorite dish in the whole world... I will for sure try it. By the way I’m not very found of cooking, but you make everything look so easy that I want to try. So thnx once again ☺️
I'm from Bangladesh.I like your recipes very much😍😍😍
Well done... 👌

But am jealous of the sun shining
This looks amazing & so healthy. Definitely making. Thanks Donal!
Looks amazing 😍😍 I've tried so many of your recipes which have turned out amazing can't wait to try this one as well. Love all of your video's 😍😍😍😍
Happy New Year to you and your beautiful family, Donal 💕😊 Greetings from Myanmar 🇲🇲
I was just going to the kitchen to make pesto pasta when I saw the notification !!
Great recipe for a quick weeknight meal thanks Donal and happy new to you, Sofie, Noah and Max
Part of the 5 views and 0 comments club! :-)
Omg I always thought pesto wasn't that easy you are a lifesaver 🤓
I agree with you Donal..make your own pesto!!   This looks so delicious (as all of your recipes do)!  Thanks!
you're always making me feel hungry Donal, though I just had my super heavy meal... From the Philippines here... <3
Thanks for this! This looks like next Saturday’s fun meal 🥘
nice recipe . can i ask you for a recipe for risotto please
This looks amazing! Will definitely be cooking it his week for the fam!
Hell no.. HELL NO!!!

Potatoes don't cook quicker than that pasta! Something has gone wrong here..
Oh, Donal, what a lovely meal!
Thank you!
Just what I needed, thanks donal!
for the longest time ever, i wanted to try making my own pesto. Because the one you get in the store is very unsatisfying and I always wondered if fresh would taste better especially since i loooove wild garlic pesto.

I had no idea there were so few ingridients though! Now I really want to try however, where I'll get my hands on this huge amount of basil is beyond me and i dont have a small processor either ;o; still..that shan't stop me!

That being said: Thanks more for the great inspiration!
hi ☺ what if I do not have a pine nuts? what's a good alternative for that? There's no pine nuts here in Ph 😂 thank you
I feel so energetic while you're watching you and running to kitchen to try the recipe 😋
🇹🇷 Türkiye den sevgiler harika gözüküyor 👍😊🌼
Pesto. Pasta. Potatoes. Green beans.   Mmmmmmm !!!
Now this is going to be my dinner this weekend ! Thanks Donal !!
 I always enjoy your recipes 👍👍
Happy new year !!
Please keep doing healthier recipes like this.
you always have the most beautiful ceramics. Please tell us where you got them!
yum def gonna try, have a happy new year!!
This looks phenomenal. I've not seen a pasta pesto with green beans and potatoes before. I'm gonna have to try this.
I made this dish for dinner, right after I saw your video until the point you put the pasta into the big bowl. Wonderful idea, I do not add pesto in me pasta at least not as often as I should.
What a great recipe! Grazie!
Why am I watching this while I have to sleeeeeeepppp nowww
I am from Genova, Italy. i have to say one of the few foreigners who cooked Pesto the right way and paired it with the right pasta type
I just discovered this guy! For a girl who loves cooking and Finn Bálor, this guy is perfect lol
Great video Donal! Been a huge fan for a few years now. I still always make the berry pavlova recipe you uploaded a few years ago! Absolutely love homemade pesto and I liked the tip about roasting the pine nuts. It gives the pesto that extra depth. I love serving my pesto with some finely chopped tomatoes  because this just gives the dish that added bit of freshness which helps balance out the pesto. Also one thing I would recommend for this recipe would be to save a bit of starchy pasta water at the end. The salted pasta water does a wonderful job at helping the pesto combine really nicely with the pasta. Anyways love your video! Keen for the next one :)
already had dinner but im hungry again T_T
I love your food network shows.
Pesto pasta is so good.  Having grown up in Canada with our version of "spaghetti", it was great to discover all other ways pasta was meant to be enjoyed.  Glad to see you add the salt after the water comes to a boil.  Happy new year.
This looks great! I've yet to make pesto. I'm definitely going to try to this soon.
What a huge pot, you could take a bath in it :D
Looks absolutely delicious. Especially that green pesto.
Yoo donal skehan nice pesto its looks scruptious. I would opt for tri colored fusilli tho
Pesto is fine, but man how the hell are you cooking that pasta?
1) The water should be boiling when you put pasta inside. Rule.
2) You don't cook pasta with vegetables in the way you did. It's ok if you're making a soup or something similar, but absolutely not when cooking pasta...
Donal , please do different kinds of egg recipes......
Rip Amazon
That pesto looks delicious! Can't wait to try it, I admit that I am one of those that buys pesto in a jar xD
I'm not doing any support..
But that pasta looks like worms haha
Im definitely making this dish. Looks amazing! And the potatos! Yes
I'm the only one at home that loves pesto. Everytime I eat it they're weirded out by the smell of basil 😂
Enjoyed those tips in this video.
Hej Donal,
If you want to make it fully vegetarian but can't find good faux-parmesan, what type of cheese would you use as substitute? Or make it without any cheese at all and make it vegan?
and naturally the comment section is filled with angry know-it-all Italians fighting with all their strength to defend the one last source of pride that corrupt, xenophobic hellhole of a country has left. 


just enjoy the effort, time and passion Donal puts into his food and learn to only lecture people on food when they ask you for an opinion
Hadn't heard about pasta & potatoes IMHO they don't mix very well but I guess there's no accounting for taste....
Padadoes
ma vaffanculo
It's so tasty Donal...! Yum
I love your recipes, you are very talented.
However, anyone who has ever made pesto know is that it always takes some tweaking and never comes out perfect the first time... I know none of us can taste what you are making, but it would be great if you could show what someone would need to do if it didn’t come out to the specific taste they were looking for... I don’t believe it came out 100% perfect the first time.. i’ll bet it was good, but could have used some tweaking..
pls support me...
Vieni a Genova a mangiare le vere trofie al pesto, fagiolini e patate. Quello che hai cucinato, noi a Genova,  lo chiamiamo minestrone.
I want to eat it right now 😋😋 looks yummmmm......!!!
Oh, that looks good. Pesto is great. In the past, I have had so much basil from the garden, that I am forced to eat giant basil salads with just basil and dressing.
ahhh love me a good pesto pasta as a student. Will be trying this one out for sure to switch it up a little. Bet homemade pesto is so much nicer! Thanks Donal!
Pasta water... Never throw away ALL the pasta water
Podaydo
Puh-ray-roes....
Yummmm
do yourself a favor and make the pesto in a pestle and mortar. you really want to smash those ingedients together instead of just cutting them.
Talking too fast…
Great. 👏👏👏👏👏
Newbie
arriverà il giorno in cui il signore te la farà pagare per tutte le merdate che cucini
How do you avoid bitter basil?  My pesto is always bitter!
Delicious! Yes, in Liguria, the home of pesto, that is how they serve pasta with pesto with little potatoes and green beans. Heavenly!
PADADOS!!
Wherez the salt
Thanks Donal. I love pesto, but recently discovered that I’m sensitive to nuts. What can you substitute instead of the pine nuts?
Nice
That's an interesting way to eat green beans. Gotta try it soon
Great 👍
what is that shape of pasta called?
I don't see how the potatoes could cook through without overdoing the pasta...
Don't potatoes cook longer than pasta?
Great recipe Donal.Been making it almost like this.Will use baby potatoes instead of potato batons.You simplyfy everything
He addressed that the main ingredients of potatoes and green beans are traditional, but low key tries to present trofie as a ‘different’ option, like it’s his twist but it’s not. It’s LITERALLY the pasta of choice for this very specific dish in Liguria. Hate it when tv cooks do this “what I like to do” sh@t when it’s exactly what they learned to do from somewhere else.
This is so good. Will it be wrong if we added a couple of chillies as i am an Indian and like my food a bit spicy. Tfs
Yum looks delicious i am making this soon can make this to low carb and vegan as am low carb and vegan started on 20 November 2018 onwards no recipe at box below your video pl fix it tell max i love him soooooooo much and i say hi to him my focus is on him love dogs tell max he is my best friend love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
Next time I'm in Ireland, I'll drop by your place and give you some Italian tips....
Uses two cups of oil = 2000 calories
Was a delight to watch. The potato cake looked awesome. Good tips about tomato soup. Mushroom pasta looks so tempting and easy. I am gonna try these recipes.
They all sound so very yummy Donal!! 🤤🤤👌👌
I always love your recipes for comfort food that in many instances remind me of the British Isles.  One thing I have to point out is the use of a mandolin, an extremely dangerous kitchen tool.  You professional cooks know how to watch yourself when using one, however, most of your followers are not that used to them!  Always, always, always, always insist that when using a mandolin, one should use the provided guard.  By not insisting on this, one wonders how many followers have just cut a thumb or finger attempting to emulate your kitchen prowess.  I have lost a part of my thumb..and a fair amount of blood..by not using the guard and have become a crusader.  Signed “Thumbless” 🙄.   p.s.  Happy New Year to you and your lovely family.
Great video as always Donal.  Now I just need to actually start cooking :D
Love to the family and a happy 2019 !
All the recipes were awesome...... love your channel ❤️❤️❤️
will you make a Swedish "semla" for Easter?? Please do;)
Don't discard the garlic "shells"!  You can toss them into a broth or even tomato sauce for extra flavor then pull them out before serving.  Then you can toss them.  ;)
With all  respect Donal;you are so handsome,and I already try many of your recipes and I‘ve been never disappointed!thank you so much.Have a great Year 2019!
WINTER RECIPES! Yet the tomato soup "is ideal for summer". Lol. Nice recipes though, happy New Year Donal
Can't wait to try them..... Love them all.😍😍😄😄
Love you, Donal.
Happy New year
Wow! This is my first time watching your channel. Was recommended by Ann Rherdon. Your channel is absolutely amazing! It's so professional and well done! I can't wait to try Pomme Ana! I feel like I'm watching Food Network it's so nicely done!
you just reminded me that I have to buy stuff and try doing the mushroom pasta..btw they all look so good!!
you are a big fan of Garlic 😂 they looks yummy thanks.
Butter soy sauce and fresh sweet corn cooked together. Delicious!
Have liked the video 😉 and the first one looks great wow 😲 who agrees?🤚🤚
How do you get good Roma tomatoes, for the soup, in the winter?
All of these look so amazing - I am a huge tomato soup fan.  Thanks and Happy New Year Donal!!
Golden bottom in the kitchen eh 🤔😳
They look delicious , let me dream about cookin them 😅😅
I adore cold tomato soup :)
Dina recept är Fantastiska!
Älskar troligen alla varianter 

(Dock inte sett allt som du har på din sida)
How's the show going? Thanks for the great work.
another awesome video of my type of comfort foods
"SOY!" Stopped watching right there. Good luck, mate. I'm out.
For a little variation, I like to add olives to the chicken stew.
They're so good 😋😋😛
can you use like fettuccine or angel hair for the pasta?
I really enjoyed the tomato soup. The taste of garlic in it is very nice. It is my go to tomato soup recipe now.
I know you. If I am right you have a TV show with NAT GEO PEOPLE or FOX that also airs in India.
This Irish man loves his potatoes 🤓
You make it look easy
For the soy butter pasta, do you have any recommendations if you don’t like mushrooms?
I'm Indonesian,  i like so much pasta ( all kind of noodle) 😊
Humor !!!  New Subscriber

Hi Donal - would the Roman chicken taste good with some mashed potato or sweet potato? Also happy new year!

That mushroom pasta  is new to me and I will be making it soon. Tomorrow or Friday.

Can you make pasta naked?
Standard Truffle oil is made in a laboratory, tastes of perfume and is revolting.

Hilarious!!!! 🤣 Thanks Donal for all the great videos this year!! Me and my kids love to watch them!!! Would love if you could do a video on how you started cooking and how u got in to it professionally?
The two dislikes were Sophie and Noah because Max’s barks got a cameo but they didn’t.
Jag önskar att du sjöng mer i dina videos, och vad med din förra karriär i en popgrupp! :) har så många frågor! :)
My god this is funny. Happy New Year Donal! 😂 🎊 🎉
Bloop, bloop, bloop away!!!! These were so funny!! Happy holidays, Donal.
So excited to see this! Been waiting for it all year! Why was the singing in the bloopers? That's not a blooper, that was incredible!
Love the video so funny and happy new year donal. Best wishes for 2019.🎉🎉😄😄😍😍
I’m crying with laughter my mum is probably wondering what’s going on.  happy new year to you and everyone who sees this  more bloopers soon PLEASE
Donal, this makes me feel much better haha. I can't tell you the amount of hours of footage I have to edit out just because I can't say something as simple as 'now add a pinch of salt and pepper' without screwing it up lol.
Hahahahah I love these vids!!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣
Happy New Year to you and your beautiful family. Blessings
When you screamed though 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Most of those would have been funny as hell to see in the videos
Hey handsome
Hilarious! Now u are real.....u were too perfect before! Happy New Year!

Happy New Year 🎊 to You, Your lovely family and your staff 🎈 I cant decide on my favorite recipe blooper they all made me laugh

<3
I worry about you some times.
I love your episodes in tlc and it was so funny when they gave you a bathe in one of your europe tour
This was so funny ahah
I'm so baffled by the pooping comment! 🤔 so funny. And you just lying on the counter, must have been a long shoot. Happy New Year to all the family and crew! 🥂
1:12 XD
LOVE this Donal!  I have a folder of bloopers, much fun to see what goes on behind the scenes. Thanks for all of your terrific videos -- Looking forward to seeing what you have cooking in the New Year! Happy NY to you!

Happy New year!
Happy New Year
Happy New Year Donal
Who’s that at 3:09? He looks so familiar...
😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🏼👍🏼
so funny
Hi Donal! I loved this recipe, but I would never be able to make it :(   I'm a student, and now I live alone, in a student dorm, with a kitchen equipped with just one microwave and a cooktop. And I have just one pot XD 
Would it be too much to ask for one video with a couple of meal recipes that are balanced (offer some vitamins) and easily done with just one pot, one cooktop and a microwave? I honestly have zero knowledge about what to cook in order to keep my body alive hahahah thank you!! I love your work btw!
two of my favorite people interacting AND making one of my favorite dishes?
Christmas confirmed.
I LOVE these recipe/vlogs. They are amazing. I just adore watching you with your family. Please keep them going!!!
Lussekanelbulle?! Best not tell anyone in Sweden about this.
OMG THE INTRO 😍😍 
Your videos are heartwarming,Donal ❤ 
They make me happy :))))))) 
Noah is such a cutieeee. Cutie patootie 👀😂😙
I love cinammon rolls and rosanna is in your video best video ever
I love this format of videos! It's vloggy and educational - a perfect combination!
11:37 nice shot ...

These cinnamon rolls loke really nice, but I already made Rosanna's gingerbread cookies :D
Your videos are so good, filled with energy and warmth. I have a tip, when I do my lussebullar, I use a vanilla-butter-suger mixture inside instead of a cinnamon. The vanilla elevates the taste of the saffron. God Jul och Gott Nytt År från Sverige (merry christmas and a happy new year)!
OMG SO YUMMY! 🤤😱





also I’m Indian... so I have saffron at home! 😉🤓
As a Swedish person I am a bit sad ro say that I had never tried this kind of cinnamonbun untill earlier this year, but man are they tasty! Also I did not know that pärlsocker (pearl sugar) isn't a thing outside of Sweden 🤔 Anyway, really liked the video, keep up the good work!👍
The vlog is such a cute idea!! Merry Christmas to you Donal and your gorgeous family!
The first time I saw you, Donal, was on Roasanna's channel, so this was nice. Have a nice time in Sweden! Merry Christmas to you and yours!
ro and donal and his beautiful wife and son. perfect. merry christmas!
Merry Christmas to you and your family here's hoping some nice person at the airlines performs some Holiday magic that allows you and Sophie to sit together. I love the vlog/recipe format.
Love the new style of videos!!
Love the milk and butter tip. I use the finger temperature tip when making yogurt. If I can hold my finger in the milk for 10 seconds without swearing then I know it's ready to continue. Lol  oh I like Noah' s reaction. Save trip and Merry Christmas.
Wow those look absolutely delicious I love them. I’ve never heard of these buns before 😍 Merry Christmas to you and your family 🎄🎄🎄
St. Lucia Buns is what I've heard those saffron buns called.  Thank you Paul Hollywood for introducing me to these "warm milk, saffron, yeast, raisin" buns.  Hooray for bringing Ro's Seattle snow down to LA for a day of "wintery" fun.  I'm sure Noah will never forget it.
The recipe is too good.........I'll definitely try it soon 😊😊
Prefer these vlog type cooking videos, seems more natural and shows you and your family in a beautiful light. Please keep this style!
I'm enjoying them thanks Donal enjoy Sweden in the winter it's going to be very hot here in Adelaide on xmas day its going to be  35 degrees Celsius
Loving the new style of your videos and seeing you all together as a family. Safe travels and merry Christmas
Really really like the recipe and vlog style!!
Oh, love that intro! You guys are just the cutest 😍
i’ve been waiting for you guys to collab since so long
i'm curious now 
about who cooks at home!you or she?
Donal youre getting old. Gladfully you age well!
My mum always made lussekatter when I was a kid and cardamom is a must in any baked good I make now, now I'll have to try this combination.  Cardamom=December holidays for me! It's the best scent in the world to me
Merry Christmas Donal.........🎅🎅
Are you using Dan sukker? That’s danish! OMG
Wow great job. I will try
Happy holidays to you all
Loved the video!
Love to watch sofi and Noah with u...❤️❤️.. lovely family..😍😍
Oh wow, it's been a while since I saw H to the usky husky in a youtube video.

He looks.. a bit different than I remember :D
this looks like an indian recipe.. not swedish ! :)
I lik u ppl.. Donal sofie Ro n Mike.. But my favorite is noah..
These vlogs and recipes are great together!
Donal just two cardamom are  enough for that amount of flour otherwise it's gonna taste too strong. I loved your show FOLLOW DONAL
Saffron is the stamen of an autumn crocus - a crocus is a corm, a lily is a bulb -
 I hope you forgive me fo being so pedantic because I have watched you for years and always enjoy what you say and cook ! Noah is beyond cute and Sophie is a lovely mom. Safe trip to Sweden. Happy Christmas and a healthy and prosperous New Year.
Saffron comes from the crocus sativus flower, or saffron crocus. It’s a type of iris, not a lily.
Hi 👋 
Long time without seeing you here! Awesome recipe, but It’s too expensive saffron in Brazil
I think I am going to use turmeric instead! Sounds crazy I know, but I love try new things. How about a Swedish Apple cake next time? That one upside down. I love it. Happy Holidays
and who do you give the rest to?
love the way yoy say  lussebulle,, I´m Swedish,,,
This was such a cute video!!! I love when you add Sophie and Noah! Aww Merry Christmas 😊
Safe even.
This not only looks like such an amazing recipe - but you and Rosanna are so much fun to watch!!!
Make another video with sophies grandparents while you’re in sweden!!!
Only recipes i prefer
Noah 😘😘😘😘
Since I’m a Swede and a total fan of lussebullar I have a tip for you! It’s easier to get out all of the saffron if you add just a little bit of sugar into the pestle mortar! God jul! ❤️
Crocus of a lily? You surely meant the stamen of a crocus. There’s 3 stamens per crocus and they have to be picked by hand!
These look delicious, it´s past Christmas now but it´s never a wrong time for these so. I hardly ever eat cinnamon buns at cafés because the ones I´ve tried have always been too dry or tasted too much like butter which is a shame because I´m always on the lookout for the perfect one. My mom used to make cinnamon buns so often when I was achild but has not had them much since and am thinking of making my own. I´ve been looking at so many recipes and these really look delicious.
Can't wait to watch this! :D
Noah is the best!!! More Noah he is soooo cute!!!

Love the vlog recipe videos! Noah is just so darn cute!
I'm hungry now..aaaannnddd its morning..so I'll go make breakfast first then try to make this (I think I'm going to fail)
Awwww... Pewdiepie will be so proud 😗
First viewwwww
They look good and ro always out does herself. And Noah is getting so big. Happy holidays to you and everyone on here. 😁💖🎁🎅🌲
lily or crocus..same thing.one posionous but hey.;-) did you know there are sapphran crocus farms in the UK? Merry Christmas
Hey Donal is there a way to tell when ur yeast is good or bad batch?
Yum looks delicious i am making this soon can make this to low carb and vegan as am low carb and vegan started on 20 november onwards i liked your other videos didnt comment on it  after you come back tell max i love him sooooooo much and i say hi to him my focus is on him love dogs love your videos making me hungry Thanks Ramya
Time to unsubscribe, your videos used to be good but now the new style is boring
*Serves 8*
i bet i can finish it alone, how delicious they look !
What would we do without butter. Be sure to thank a cow <3. Another great recipe Donal.
I'm always on the lookout for another chicken pot pie recipe...thanks Donal!!
Mmmm, both of these look delicious and like something my own family would serve around the holiday table.  The sun going down, smelling thyme, rosemary, black pepper coming from the kitchen, and anticipating eating something delicious... yup, that sounds like pretty much my Christmas dinner all right.
Gotta try this one...
its straight on the list for post Christmas day meals, look delish
Amazing chef Donal! 😀😀😀 I love anything that's Irish!
More more more of this!!!
that looks totally yum!! how I miss my fig tree back in South Africa!! that chook pot pie is to die for..definitely on the menu for Christmas Eve!! thank you for sharing Chef!! :)
The pie looks gorgeous, but I was exhausted just from looking at it being made :D These days I just throw together a few ingredients and call it done.
Your video's and recipes  are really great and I'm proud to be irish 😂 and I just watched your video with rosanna pansino again 🎄🎄
I made both dishes and Wow they are such an explosion of flavour. 
Next time I will chop  the pickled onions in half as I found their flavour a bit over whelming. But for my husband who loves pickled onions, he wouldn’t change a thing. 
Lovely recipes!
the most difficult part is cutting the bread! jesus.. or maybe my bread is the wrong one
I love the chicken pot pie.I'm going to try this at my home.
that pie looks amazing, really really wanna make it. loving your recipes lately donal, theyre so quick i keep noting down the ones i wanna make and that hardly happens with me and cooking videos on youtube!
That is literally the best chicken pot pie I've ever seen.
Looks good!
I just love that stoneware dish you made the chicken pot pie in, where does it come from? Lovely recipes as always <3
Imagine the Baked Cheese board, but instead of Camembert use “Vacherin Mont D’Or”, only available from fall to spring. At best with some nice Wine, just delicious. Greetings from eastern Switzerland.
I'm going to be "that" person - *platter
Yes to both
We're the chicken pal?
cool recipe Donal! now i can seriously cook a chicken dish,as i knew there are a lots chicken dishes but this pot pie has truly made my day!
Hi Donal could you please make some food for us down here in the southern hemisphere it's going to be really hot this xmas
the amount of butter you use in your recipes is absolutely fantastic
This is in the oven as I type! The filling is delicious already. The recipe doesn't mention egg wash though so I didn't do it :( I like the look of the really golden brown top!

EDIT: This is so delicious. Only thing I would add to the recipe is to mention to 'nestle' the dumplings into the sauce, as seen in the video. They came out pretty dry, but delicious anyway!!
Looks (and I'm sure tastes) amazing! But wouldn't this be better called "chicken and dumplings"?
popeye?
Donal that thyme plant was crying after that last pull! Lol. It was saying  "NO, NO, NO More thyme!" Those looked amazing but that last one was 'thyme' consuming! Lol!  Bon jour and Gracie!
❤️❤️
Mmmmmmmmmmmm...amazing....💗
Nice pie it's looks as aflower
Yummy cheeses
I’m an American ( Irish - German) living in the Philippines.  I am addicted to cheese btw. To kick a dish up the other day I used Irish Butter and Irish Cheddar. Holy smokes what a difference. It is so worth the extra money
Love the video... You have such a beautiful family! Merry Christmas!!!!
I’m loving the family vlogs ❤️👌🏼
You have a really beautiful and cute family
Very funny vid Donal and Sofie. Merry Christmas Sofie, Donal and Noah and Max hope full of good cheer, Laughter and great presents 🎁🎄🎅🤶

Great video Skehan family! Noah is speaking my cookie language "ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya" LOL!!!
Merry christmas ....love U from Egypt 😍😍
Love this!!  Combining chocolate + peppermint = life!!  I need to try this for my cookie swap this weekend!
Wow Noah meet Santa.It is a breaking news. This video is awesome.I wish your Holliday was great.
Wow, you both are such a happy couple! Blessings!
What a cool video just think it's so lovely see all of them cooking
Love the video!!! Nice to see your real cooking setting. I miss the old videos where you showed more of the cooking and less editted scenes. Noah is super cute and so is Max. Merry Xmas guys!!!
this is so cute. I absolutely love the name Noah. Merry Christmas to you all 🎄
This was so adorable!!!! Put me in the spirit of Christmas! What a lovely video!
OMG.!!!! Donal. I tried these cookies today for my son's Christmas Party at school and it turned out super good. LOVED IT!!!!! Thank you so much
oh he's so sweet you guys 😍😍
If you haven't got that bottle open, wrap an elastic/rubber band around the lid.  Gives youore purchase to open it.
Merry Christmas, guys! Love your energy.
a dislike? A DISLIKE????
Good morning! :)
You have a lovely family and I love your cooking! Hope Max will appear again in a video. ❤️
perfect family video baking cookies with baby its so how it really goes. cute, cute, cute
Love seeing sophie in your videos,  sending you all Seasons Greetings hope its carnage as its lots more fun that way xxxx
Merry Christmas Donal......☃️☃️🎄🎄
My favourite you are . Try all your recipies
I tried to convert the measurements to American measurements, but gave up because it was too difficult. For example, you say 110 g of butter but then your website is different. It says 125 grams. Please clear up. Thank you.
Lovely video!! Have a wonderful Christmas with your beautiful family! 🥰💚🎄
Three of my crowns came loose...do I send the bill to you in the US...or?!
I know!  Like what's up with the covers on the vanilla??  I have the same problem.  I love the huge window in your kitchen, soooo nice.  An easier way to crush the candy canes is to put them in a zip loc bag & then to smash them with a rolling pin.
soo cute
Really loving these new videos! Noahs bday looked so fun and these cookies look delish
Love this new style!
We love watching your videos! Your channel is awesome! It's so fun and sweet to watch your whole family involved in the kitchen and vlogs!:) We are now your fans!:) We love your accent too:) If you would like to check our twins cooking show MnMTwinsKitchen https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-fiXpJjdJeAr25jbdPiSA
Love the new style!
Why to go Sofie they look great yum!
I am early
very nice👍
Santa visit is a cool activity! It seems like Noah was wondering "Hey why you guys took me there? who is the guy in red cloth??" Haha! Anyway, wish you and your family have a wonderful Christmas!
Cool
Love how Honest the video is and that you no longer have the camera crew. Not that they didn't do an excellent job or that you didn't like them but you need your freedom and privacy in your home. Please keep this way of filming it is so like our own kitchens.
Awww.. Noah is adorably michevious. I want to play wit him.. Chooo chweeet.. Merry christmas to u all.
First
Let me know if you guys like this new recipe vid style! :)
I prefer you and Sophie filming rather than the professional crew setting!!
loved the video. Noah is so cute wish him a happy birthday
Also, I ADORE this style of videos. Please, more like this. I just think you have the most wonderful family, and I love to watch you guys all together like this. ❤
Loved this way of filming . Fantastic seeing your new helper in the kitchen, Noah will be running the kitchen real soon.
Awww, guys. This makes me SO happy. Noah is such a beautiful little boy. I love how much of a cuddle bug he is, with his head on your shoulder. It's just so sweet. 💗💗💗

By the way, the breakfast hand pies are BRILLIANT. I'm going to have to try these out for sure.
Ayee happy birthday 🎂! :D

You argue with your oven the way I argue with my voice control tv remote control.  Always enjoy your videos Donal!
Happy Birthday
Good but it needs some cheeeeeeeeeeese inside, either in the omlet or on top of the bacon before packing the pastry. 😊
Happy birthday ..Noah..Happy family..awesome Donal..awesome..
LOVE the new style! Det är mer känsla och närvaro, kör på! Och kalasen blir likadana i 5-7 år, minst, sen mattas det av tackochlov.  Congratis!

Kindness your way
Neil { Lochness Scottish Highlands )
Noah's over there in his highchair wondering why is my daddy talking to himself....lol
Donal...this has to be my favorite video of yours. I loved that you hadn't perfected your recipe before hand; I loved seeing your beautiful wife and adorable son. The idea of the photo book is terrific, one which I intend to adopt for my daughter and her family! I think I will collect all of 2019 pics of her family (5 kids) for and do a similar book. Thank you so much for letting all of us a tiny bit into your lives and giving us good ideas for brekkie!
Happy Birthday Noah... Cute little boy..
LOVED this video, Donal, Sophie and Noah! HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the little one! It would be GREAT to  see more vlogs of your outings with Arthur and Brian because your Insta stories of all of your little outings together are the highlight of my day! You guys make me laugh so much!
happy birthday Noah... here's to many more...
Cute! Am I blind? Or where is the recipe?
Happy 1st bday!!!🎉
Wonderful!!  You are such a lovely family!
Happy birthday Noah

I love your baby
Wont the egg get really overcoked when baking the pies?
LOVE LOVE LOVE this style of filming Donal 😍😍❤️❤️
Great recipes and Happy Belated Birthday Noah! Keep up the good work!
Recipes seem yummy as always, but I'm not a fan of the format. The channel bears your name, I come here to see / hear you cooking. Silent clips with captions over some music is dangerously close to those dime-a-dozen "cooking" videos by the likes of Tasty. I'm not saying their content is bad, I'm just saying there is an oversaturation of those silent videos and you really shouldn't give up one of the things that make your videos stand out - in this case your voice and personality you bring to the videos.
It looks sooo good making me hungry...... Will definitely try it
Nice.

Couldn't read most of the text cards, though.
Love the recipes & the format, but 1 thing. Can you make the captions a bit bigger & bolder if you do videos like this in the future?
Like the recipes, but not the format... So "Tasty"-like...
Mushroom toast recipe is my favorite, but they all look delicious.
The way this video is laid out makes it so easy to follow
Oh my goodness... these look absolutely divine! Especially that last one. I love mushrooms and cream. I'm seriously regretting not having purchased mushrooms while at the grocery store this morning.
Your recipes are always on point! Thank you!
Thank you donal for these delicious recipes...and I love your new style ... keep the great work !
OoOh wow I need that Pikachu meme right now because that's how I am while watching this. 😍
Absolutely a delicious and irresistible recipe💪👌👍
Yesssss.... Expecially 2 the one with mushrooms!!!!
Dude, I was trying to eat healthy, and then you come out with this video of deliciousness?!
Tomorrow breakfast!! 👍👍 thanks ~
So loved the recipes and when you said the word serious, whilst talking about the pain perdue, Siri, got activated and started telling me about a steak house.
Best Chef in the World! Dead Honest! 🙏
Me: Trying to eat through the screen :P
Can u please make it for me😉😉
Amazing love the mushrooms
Never thought of adding ricotta with french toast! Keen to try it. I absolutely love serving french toast with a berry compote. However during those winter months, berries are not in season so fresh berries can be incredibly expensive. That's why often times, I tend to use frozen berries for my compotes because they break down anyways. When I have fresh berries around the house, I can't resist but just to eat them straight out of the box!!!
Looks so yummy ❤
Perfection !!! :O
They stopped selling this bread in the UK :( Anyone know where to buy it from?
Wow!! Finally it’s here!! 😍
They look amazing!!!
Looks fantastic!! ❤️👍❤️👍
I ❤️ mushrooms
Amazing.
Indonesia? 🇮🇩
I'm afraid we don't have sausage meat in my country, can I use minced meat instead?
kein gutes Format
Wow, those look easy and yummy!
Creamy mushroom on toast
You have skill in the kitchen in front of a camera. This was just an advert for a company.
The mushroom one looks very yummy.
What bread did you use? :)
new style! very nice!!
fantastic
💗💗💗
Yummmmmyyyyyyyyy 😋😋
Yummy.
What in the world is passata?
Thank you and yes please more vegetarian dishes 🙏🏻🙏🏻
