Dear Manjula, at the end of the video, you said ragda patty instead of puri....at least that’s what I heard 😃😃 quite a natural association of words! Delicious recipe as always. The most important idea I’ve taken from your channel is that it is possible to cook without garlic and onion! Thank you 🙏🏻
Hi namaste are those beans
Thank God for this beautiful queen
Thank you for sharing this recipe Manjula. I tried it and it’s delicious! Added a few cloves of garlic to the pesto sauce too :)

Hi Manjula, I don’t have access to fresh basil where I live. I have plenty of freeze dried basil. Will I be able to rehydrate it and use it to make the pesto?
Yummy! Can’t wait to try it out
Very nice, what could we use instead of   Baby spinach
serves 6?  Manjula Aunty I could probably eat the whole bowl all by myself with a spoon.  it looks so yummy!!!!
Amazing recipe. I love it ✨🌟💕
This salsa looks very delicious and refreshing, I will be making this Thank you, Manjula
Serves 6, but I’m not sharing any.

Looks fresh and yummy. I have to try this!
I'm making this! 😊
Thấy thèm quá chị ơi
Dear manjula, i tried your besan laddu recipe almost 8 years ago, and it turned out awesone. I was student at that time, now im married . My inlaws asked me to make laddus, it reminded me of you. And im happy to see you again, and posting yummy recipes. Feeling you like a family member who teaches good things 😊
Awesome
mouth watering
Very nice 😊😊
💢💥🙌👌👏💙💜❤😃😄😍😛😬😮😚
If you roll the lime under your hand firmly, squashing it slightly, before you slice it, you will get more juice out. I’m sure you already know this however.
Very nice....can you show tomato salsa recipe also ?
As usual, another awesome, simple recipe Manjulaji. ☺️
Thank you for this recipe 😍
Love you Manjula!  I hope you get to 1million subscribers soon!!  Your recipes are delicious and healthy and your videos are some of the best on YouTube!!

Thank you auntie, Lovely recipe!
Nice namaste you can cook the whole eggplant
Truly, I enjoyed this video
This looks yummy! I have all the ingredients, even hing (asafotida)...only need to purchase the baby eggplant, which I love! Thanks for such a simple recipe...I love your cooking style and easy explanation. Thank you for posting...have missed seeing you lately. :) Cynthia from Houston, TX
Thanks for the receipe mam
I loved this ! Im going to try this as soon as I can it looks so tastyyy
I love eggplant will be making this for sure, love your recipes keep up the good work and Thank you, Manjula
I love your recipes!!
My favourite.....
So yummy 😋.. love it
My mother made this recipe all the time. So tasty. One difference, the way she cut the eggplant. She left the stem and slit from the bottom. There is a saying in my language, the fleshy part of the stem also very tasty. Yes tamarind balanced the tartness of the eggplants. This can also be done with small capsicums, and Zucchini.
Manjula -- thank you so much for keeping this dish vegan; I've seen preparations that use yogurt or cream.  Two questions:  1) Can I use amchor instead of tamarind?  2)I've seen these baby eggplants where the spice mix is stuffed into the eggplants.  Could this be done with this preparation?  Thx.
I enjoy your gentle way of demonstrating your recipes. You don’t rush through and I can keep up. Thanks
Good Afternoon Madam,
⛅⛅⛅⛅⛅⛅⛅⛅⛅

Bagara Baingan
It is not only in Hyderabad, but also a very popular dish in our Telangana State. I am very happy to see this recipe by you..

Dear Manjula, thank you so much for your fantastic videos and delicious recipes! I enjoy Indian Cuisine so much and I am happy to be able to cook it myself, thanks to your show ! Keep up the good work! All the best from the South of Germany 💗
Hi Manjula!  I want to try this recipe but have a few questions 1)  I have mustard oil so can I omit adding black mustard seeds?  2) what other seeds would work well?  I want to try pumpkin seeds but wonder if it will alter the taste.  

Judt made you okra bhindi yesterday and it was amazing!
Yum yum love your videos

Manjula the holy grail of cooking
I made these last night and took them to my friend's house as my contribution to dinner.  Let's just say there were none left, and I am planning to make them again this evening. YUM!!
Looks delicious as always! Thank you Manjula! Hope you always make videos
Yum how amazing!
Love it!
Unique receipe
Looks delicious.
Are you a proud vegan?
www.vegangaga.co
Could they be baked instead of fried?
Yummy
Very  Nice  and  yummy.
I will be making this for a vegan who doesn't eat sugar so, for the pear sauce, if you don't want to use sugar, what is a good substitute?
Nyce ..u r in which country?
I'm sure they are pretty tasty. But they look more like cutlets than Gnocchi. Gnocchi is very different and the title is a definite misrepresentation of a traditional Italian dish.
very nice mam🌹🌹🌹
The pear sauce looks so good!
Nice recipe. But this is not gnocchi.
My friend what sauce accompaniments the balls? Thanks
Thanks for sharing your recipes 😁👨‍🍳💕💕
You are the best mam. Lots of love and blessings to you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
