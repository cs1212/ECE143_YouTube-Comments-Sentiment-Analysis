Seeing you smile and dance at the end was great! Really missed your smile chef
"Say, 'Francis is a good dog' 5 times..." LOVE IT
Yay! So excited for a new video! I hope you’re doing well. :)
Looks Delicious! Nice to see you again ! Thanks for posting this !
Been watching her since I was 20 now I’m 29 and she hasn’t aged at all. Bless your heart ❤️
YAY!! Our favourite Chef is back! 💖 💖 I can't wait to see you and Francis. Only 4 hours. What will I do to fill the time between now and then? It may be awhile between videos but Chef and Francis are worth the wait. This soup looks like comfort food for cooler Spring nights.
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁 ☺
So happy to see you again!
"Say 'Francis is a cute dog' seven times or wait about ten seconds."
This is how I'm going to tell time from now on.
Yes! I've always been waiting for your videos. I’m so glad to see Chef smiling and dancing at the end. I really like it when Francis’ voice said "Say Francis is a cute dog 7 times and wait for 10 seconds.” It was so cute, I didn’t see that coming. Btw, my 12 year old fur baby girl already passed onto the Rainbow Bridge on the 13th of May. I hope she meets Francis in dog heaven and I hope they become friends. Fur babies will forever be remembered. Thanks for sharing this healthy recipe, Chef and Francis. Will surely make this.
I've been looking for a recipe like this! So excited! I guess I'm heading to the grocery store today
IM CRYING YOUR FRANCIS STUFFED DOGGIES ARE THE CUTEST AND OMG THE TALKING APRON. I love you so much Chief Oba-Chan! I love both you and Francis so much. He is a very good dog.
So excited! Love you so much!
Like Chef does so, I always make dashi broth from kelps and dried bonito, not MSG. It tastes much better and healthier. Slicing konbu and put in the soup is great idea. Thank you Chef.
The soup looks delicious!! And I can't wait to give it a try at home so my family and I can taste it. ☺️
Can't avoid smiling along the video :) the soup looks dericious, I'll definitely try to cook it this winter.

Always good to see you, chef! Take care! :)
I’m excited !!! Thank you. 💕
Miss you chef! I hope you are doing well. 🥰🥰
Wow awesome delicious miso soup recipe
Aww I thought you got Francis Jr at opening.Anywayz welcome back !
It's so good to see you again, especially chef's lovely smile! This recipe looks so yummy and I'm really hungry for miso now
Miso soup is the best!
Exciting to see your smile again! we love you chef!
We love you chef! This looks great, and pretty easy.
I just realized Francis on the apron is the one narrating the video 😁 So cute 🐩
Since moving away from the big city I can't find the ingredients for your recipes anymore, but I still love watching your videos over and over again!
Miso has so many nutritions and benefits for health and anti-aging. That's the secret of the Japanese longevity. Look at chef's skin! 🌜
This looks fantastic! Thank you Chef, and welcome back.
Yes, new video.....so excited to see you guys again. Love this recipe! 😃👍
This looks so great! Happy dancing chef is the best thing to see ~ (:
Watching a CWD video gives me a very warm feeling. Like coming home after a long day. Love that Apron Francis is talking❤️
I love how the dashi ingredients are eaten, not thrown away. Great job!
I miss the cute poodle. But, this is the best miso soup recipe I've ever seen. Most have hardly anything in a miso soup. This one is hardy and filling. Looks delicious. I hope to try making this. Thank you.
I always see the dashi stock being made before hand and the kombu and bonito get thrown out! I never thought to do it like this before. It looks so yummy!
I really enjoyed the music in the background it was very catchy and kind of relaxing, what a good episode I wanna make that soup so bad.
Hello Chef! I'm so glad to see you again.
Francis😭
We love you, Chef! Its so good to see your smiling face! Welcome back!
Thank you Chef!😍😚👍
Chef dancing 🎶 🕺 and laughing made me feel so happy! 😊 It's a pleasure to watch. 
That soup looks so warm and comforting and would be easy to make for any meal~breakfast, lunch or dinner. 😋. Yummy!
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁 ☺
did anyone else notice the frnacis on her apron was talking?
Your apron's mouth is moving! (・_・;)
Блин как долго видео не выходили мы соскучились🤗
Francis is a GREAT dog!! 🐶🐩
Welcome back! We missed your smile!
Welcome back, Chef!
This looks so comforting. It's chilly where I am.
Yum, looks delicious!  Thank you Chef and Francis!
Love this kind of soup! Looks very nutritious!
So nice to see you again presenting another yummy recipe . Wish you all the best and just keep smiling . xoxoxo from Italy

Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe :D
Missed you Chef, more videos.  We love you in Houston Texas.
This looks delicious, thank you for sharing and glad you are back!
Finally a new movie !!! I love your channel !! :) Greetings from Poland !! :)
Looks so amazing this soup, I can have this every week.😍😍but the most important is that Francis came back more happier. Thank you🙏
Great to see you again Chef :D! I notice something intresting on the background, Did your daughter had a child? If so.. congratulation on your newest family member! Blessing to your family :3
Francis is a cute dog.

LOL Anyone notice they made the dogs mouth move on the apron @ :47 

I've been drinking some whine today...I had to rewind just to ensure I wasn't that drunk.
yay was excited to see this upload! can't wait to try make this at home especially as it gets colder in nz 🤗
Was her apron talking on some scenes or was it just me?
Looking forward!!!😍😍😍
Looks great! I might give it a try! Thank you for still making these recipes. Thanks to Chef and Francis I learned to cook 10 years ago, starting with the omu rice.
It Looks Delicious 😋😋😋
And It's Fabulous 😍😍😍
Francis is a good dog, Francis is a good dog, Francis is a good dog, Francis is a good dog, FRANCIS IS A GOOD DOG 😭😭
Oh, wow.  This is something I will definitely make.  Thank you!!
Miso and bonito flakes are so expensive in denmark :(
いつものように、このレシピーもうありがとうございます！私は米国に住んでいますと日本料理屋の従業員です。毎回お疲れと感じる、お味噌の樋口を飲みます。本当に体が活性化するよ！
Great video, thank you very much.
This is the 1st video ive watched since francis died. I just haven't been able 2 watch without getting emotional.
You are so cute! Watching you cook makes me so happy and the food always looks delicious 😍
I’ve been following this YouTube channel ten years. Before sleeping I would watch Chef and Francis and it always calms me down and feeling relax. Please keep posting... We love you chef and Francis is in our heart forever.
I've never seen miso soup made this way/ in this order! You don't need to prepare the dashi beforehand and the dashi ingredients are eaten and not wasted. Seems very convenient, will definitely try this recipe!
Would love to know what made you laugh at the end, Chef!
Thank you for sharing, Chef! <3
Thank you for uploading! I miss you guys so much
Love your cooking vids so much!! 🥰
Happy dance you are back - please make more videos - you have been missed
YUMMINESS in a bowl!

So glad to see you back and having fun again.
Класс! 👍 Это наверное очень вкусно 😋😋😋
美味しいそうです！🤤🤤🤤😋😋😋 私は 最近 同じ赤いポット買いました！😃😃😃👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
So happy! And the soup looks delicious!
It's so good to see chef smile and dance💖
My favorite channel uploads again!
Perfect stuff for a college brat like me
I am going to do it tonight!  Can't wait
This looks so good,  I'm going to try to get to the wonderful Asian market near me to get the ingredients to make this for my mum when she comes to visit.  Thank you for continuing to make these videos.
Muito bom seus videos , parabéns.........
I just realized that the apron was talking
Lovely to see you! ❤
That was worth it for Dancing Chef :)
My heart is happy watching this :)
Can’t wait for the video
Yay!!!!
Nice to see you laughing again chef!

シェフの元気な姿を見せていただいてとても嬉しいです。
具が少なくお出汁の味を楽しむ「お吸い物」の味噌汁も美味しいですが、具だくさんの食べる味噌汁もそれだけでごちそうになりますね。

THE APRON IS TRIPPING ME OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good to see you, Thanks.

お味噌の量なんて計ったことありませんでした…でもこうやってデータにしてくださると、慣れない外国の方でも挑戦しやすいですね。美味しそうな家庭料理のハードルを下げてくださって、シェフとフランシスは本当に異文化交流の架け橋的存在だと尊敬しています。いつもありがとうございます😊
Y U M M Y ! ! !
Yummy 😍
Hello
Delicious
Thanks
フランシスは死んでしまったのか
Is there a good substitute  for the bonitoflakes? I'm allergic to fish :C
I have a friend who is Vegan and I was wondering if there was a way to make miso soup with mushroom stock? I want to make this for her but I can't give her the fish (even if it is the most delicious part!!)
この瞬間をずっと待ってました〜
幸せです💕 
I’d been waiting for this moment!!!
Happy to see Chef and Francis🐩⭐︎.
Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog Francis is a cute dog
Yay!
hahahaha, for eating.. as opposed to that soup you just inject directly into your veins.
If I wanted to use mainly western ingredients, for accessibility, then all I need to hunt down is the miso paste, right? Instead of the kombu and bonito flakes, I could add chicken stock concentrate and maybe a tiny splash of fish sauce. All the other ingredients have common western counterparts, except for maybe the tofu, but there are plenty of other proteins I can substitute.

I really like these videos and want to try more of your recipes, but the nearest Asian market is kind of far, so sometimes I have to get creative.
This is so nostalgic. I'm so glad they still haven't changed the intro
Had a terrible last few weeks. Landed a new job today AND get a new CWD video. What a beautiful day
Yasss i miss this channel so much 😍😍😍 can't wait for the live hehehehe
Chef's new hairstyle!! 👍
First of all, its awesome recipe as usual. And second of all, thank you for still making video. my fave  channel didnt upload their video again recently. So its wonderful to see one of my fave yt channel make new video :)
I use this channel to explain recipes and ingredients in my classes. It's a great educational resource.
This was the show (and dog) that got my daughter cooking.  We are so happy to see it back!
You've been missed, Chef. You've honoured Francis so beautifully. My heart is bursting with joy!!!
I just realized the Francis on chef's shirt was talking too. Around 1:10
I just realized: CWD is a pioneer among YouTube cooking channels.
I can't wait!! 💖 💖 💖 XXXOOO Cooking With Dog ~ the moment I see it, I'm there. See you soon Chef!
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
it seems like almost every culture on earth has a variation of beef stew, and its always really good.
Every time I watch, I wish she was my grandmother. She seems so sweet.
Bought powdered dashi just to make this, it's amazing. Thanks Chef ❤️
Tried this recipe the other night and I love love love it! Kinda sweet little salty, delicious, but tastes even better when you make extra and have it the next day!
yay francis and chef!! chef is so skilled, i love her with all my heart. the quality of this video looks extra good, and i'm looking forward to the day i can make this dish. it looks super yummy! itterasshai <3
Im gonna try this...i miss you francis🐩
Hype as hell cause this is the closest I’ll ever get to making food this good
i really appreciate how specific you get with each instruction! it really shows how much you care, and it eases the process for the viewers that would like to try, especially if they are beginners in the kitchen (like me!). this looks like a great recipe as always. <3
Missed you chef, glad you're back and cooking.
I love this dish because it's really simple to make. The first time I tried it was when I got sick from my stomach, so had to cook something light. I made nikujaga with less meat and more vegetables. It was a really pleasant flavor and sensation I got in my mounth after not eating for 2 days straight. 


Thanks for making delicious food and sharing it with us <3
I havent been on this channel for a while. I took on a lot of these recipes, and so i am sad to know that francis is no more. But glad that this show continues on :)
I'm so glad that you're back ^_^ I started watching you guys when I lived in Manchester and now I live in Okinawa so your recipes have been a great way for me to get in to the food culture. I hope you'll continue to grace our screen with your amazing cooking <3
So happy you’re back!! Missed your videos 🤗
After all these years I’m so glad to see that this channel is still here!! ❤️❤️😭
Yay auntie is back! Ill cook this 😁
What can i use to subtited the sake?
I miss you, Chef.
Wish you okay, stay healthy and be happy.
God bless you and your family
💐😊❤️
It has been too long—thank you for continuing to make these videos!
This is so nostalgic for me. I remember subscribing to this channel over 10 years ago because I loved the Nikujaga recipe from 2008 and even used it for a class project. To see it remade is putting me through a nostalgia overload Q.Q
Thank you for making this channel. I love Cooking With Dog!
Hi, thank you for your great recipe.  I miss Frances so much. 🐶
aww how cute...her sweater's talking ;)
i've subscribed to this channel awhile back ago. this was like my childhood cooking show. im so happy that they didnt change anything , rip francis u're a very good boi ♡
キッチンペーパーを落し蓋にするんですね。我が家はスコッティのキッチンペーパーを使っていますが、動画ではどちらのメーカーの物を使用していらっしゃいますか？分厚くて私が使っているものより良さそうなので、教えていただけたら幸いです💕
I've watched your videos for years now. Thank you so much for still making them! It always brightens my day!
A personal favorite dish of mine. Thank you for a less-water version too, I can't wait to try it!
I'm so happy knowing that they're honoring his memory in the show and continuing, this show taught me to cook!
thank you for the paper towel trick! this looks so good <3
True fans will know this her first dog died couple years ago than she got a new one
Thanks chef, so good to see you, it's been a long time since we saw you around here
元気そうでよかった！
Did the dog just talk???? Anyway, I love how he says 'potato"!!!  02:06
Looks delicious as always. Your channel inspired me to start my own. I can only aspire to be even half as good as your videos ☺️
You make everything look delicious ;o;
I will be trying this out, looks very appetizing. Thanks for the recipe.
One more recipe to try. Thank you so much for sharing your experience and inspiring me! I often cook to my family with your videos. ❤️

Yassss!!!
Yum! It looks so good!

I love how the picture of Francis on her sweater is narrating the video!
凄く勉強になりました✨いつもヒタヒタで煮ていたためすごく調味料を使用していたことが分かりましたわ‼️😓ありがとうございます✨
This is the first dish I actually ever made from watching your show and it was fantastic. It was one of the first videos I ever remember you making actually. It was so, so easy and so delicious. Warms my heart to see this again! Thank you!
happy spring, chef.  this recipe looks very healthy and delicious.  it is nice to see you looking so well.  more recipes, please.  i miss you and francis.
when  saw this in my notif it put a smile on my face
Wonderful recipe 🥰👍🏻❗️
These videos are therapeutic! I love this channel
Happy to see you cook again chef!!
😄
This looks delicious!!! Not much of a meat eater but I would love to try this :) About the paper towel, will a linen or cotton cheese cloth also be as effective?
I can eat up 4 serving portions myself I think.
Ms, any thoughts of getting a new best friend (dog)?
Great video, this is a really under rated channel
Ahhh my 3rd Grade Self Is Coming Back
So happy  you're back  chef 💜
yay~~ finally a semi-dry version~~ XD
I just found out that Francis already passed away. It makes me soooo sad he passed since 2016 😞😢😢. More power to you guys of still continuing your show!! Much love and more power!
I loved the premiered!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omigosh so excited!
日本語のコメントが滅多に無いのが凄い！！！

ワンコは2代目には変わらないのですか？？？
Wonderfull Chef-Francis team!!!
I miss my mom's cooking
I'm so happy! I get a new video on my birthday! <3
I love the way you cook. I love cooking, too. Love you from Vietnam. Ah. Love your dog so much 😘😘😘
I'm not disappointed! This looks just delicious. And I love your haircut Chef! You look beautiful.
It's a rainy night. This cheered me up. Thank you Chef and Francis.
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
Elegant as always~
Paper towels have tons of chemicals
I love francis voice 💕
This is my best program ever i like frances so much
Queremos ya subtítulos en español !!!
Bea de Buenos Aires 
私たちはすでにスペイン語の字幕を欲しています！
Thanks for still making videos
man so relaxing
Missed u!
I suppose a cheese cloth could be used instead of the paper towel? I'm afraid that my extra absorbent paper towels might have, um, "mystery ingredients."
Another lovely video! Chef, your hair is adorable! Thank you!
#YummerZzzz
Yay! New video! This dish looks delicious!
I missed this! ❤️
Really miss this channel:)😊
Next make Japanese fluffy pancakes!
Oiishi~
Good to have this channel posting videos
You need to sharpen that knife.
Ah, still making friends!
Looks so yummy
long time no see Francish!
Gracias!💋
The stew looks delicious . . . love your videos.
are those glass noodles?
So glad to see you back !!!!!
Holy crap that looks delicious.
Missed these videos!
This is bringing me back😭
Where's Francis? :(
Looks so yummy🤤
So happy to see chef
I want it now, it's 11pm
So yummy can you do a recipe for boys day that's coming up
im so happy this channel is still alive :')
CHEF IS THE GOAT
cuteeeeee
Damn, cooking with dog still going strong
This recipe looks very delicious and healthy ! I don’t usually eat meat but I would love to try making this.
I like the idea of using paper towel to remove the foam. Thanks, Chef for being a great role model for us who learn to cook. Although I cannot find much of Japanese ingredients, I tried to make pork stew following your recipe and it was very tasty. You are loved and appreciated in Europe. Greetings from Serbia. :)
Something happened to the poodle... that makes me sad..
Love the videos!!
I miss Francis.....
ありがとうございます😊
I love your chanel..😄
ありがとうございます🥕
that english.. haha
Great to see you!!!
💖💖💖💖
I love you Chef and Francis!
I love this channel
Wow, I love this recipe! Cooking with Dog is the best Youtuber channel around.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hello Chef and Francis!  Long time no see.  How have you been?  Let's collab again sometime.
I made this for dinner tonight. It was delicious とても楽しかったです😘😘
YAY!!!!
Can't wait to make this dish arigato gozaymas
I found this channel a few years ago while looking for a Tsukemen recipe. The Tsukemen broth was simple and so delicious! I’ve tried many other recipes such as Kiritanpo Nabe, Chicken Curry, Lotus root meatballs, etc. Hope that chef and the creator will stay healthy and continue sharing more delicious recipes!!! Love this channel!!!!!!!
I am always so glad to still see you post, been watching since I was very young, around 14/15, 21 now and still love you and am a big fan!!!!
That’s wonderful everyone’s gonna love it
This is so different to how I make it.
こんにちは。 私はあなたの料理を逃しました
francis shirt is talking O_O
stuffed dog just makes me sad, plz remove =\
is the dog sick? has been 2 years i am not following this channel again.
💜
I miss your puppy. Though, considering his passing away, have you ever considered adopting another doggy? I mean, you are a seemingly great care-taker, and honestly....I think you miss and want a little guy next to you as you cook. Either way, thanks for the upload, and I hope you have a wonderful day!
Who is the voice the dog?
I know it’s probably hard to cook without Francis there, Chef 😔 just know that are hearts will always be with you 💕 have you considered getting another pet? Not trying to replace Francis it’s just I know that your probably lonely too. when your ready,  you will be able to provide a loving home to a new loving friend ☺️😊
❤️❤️❤️
One of my favorite Japanese dishes 💖
Wow!!!! Excited to see you cook again! :)
You're back!! So happy to see the new video!^^
RIP dog
Hello
The carrots in Japan are so big compared to the ones here in the United states!
Love it
<3
superb
Where is Francis? Someone please do tell.
I am really glad to see a new episode; thank you.  But the sound quality was very bad and I could not understand a great deal of what the narrator said--very very different from prior videos.  I am hoping it is a one-time thing, as I have enjoyed the narration sooo much!
Francis is dead.
Oh my god? What's happened with the pther dog?
What happened with the dog? Did he die?😢
Love watching your vlogs,  step by step instructions and loving the recipes, very delicious and easy to follow. I miss your dog and notice you have a toy 🐶
What happen to the dog
Hello Chef, I hope you are doing well :D It’s sad not to see Francis anymore, but I like that you have the stuffed toys and the animated francis on your apron.
My kids and I love watching your channel and have made a few of your dishes!  We are such fans and more power to you!  Love the haircut!!
Chef, is there anyway to make this without alcohol? Is there a substitute for the sake? (🤰🏼)
Did Francis pass away,.?!
So it's been a while since I watched this channel? Is Francis dead?
It makes me sad that I was expecting Francis to be there sitting beside chef... but... oh 😢 missing you Francis!!!
Yummyyyyyy <3
where is Francis?
That moment when you realize Francis's mouth on her shirt is moving and never noticed it from previous videos..
This looked delicious Chef! Will try to make it the first chance I get.
The dog is stuffed now right? 🤨 i hope the real one is doing ok
I love “Cooking with Dog” very much. ☺️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🌹❤️ 
From Bangkok Thailand ka ☺️🌹🙏🏻
Very nice 😊
What happened to the real doggie?
I noticed that the dog on the stool was a toy, what happened to the real dog???
Where is Francis 🐩
Where is the doggy?
I know we can't replace Franciss, but can we have a real dog now?
can u make korean corn dog please? I want to know the recipe. Thank you :)
where is the white poodle
That looks simple and delicious!
Please buy an new dog and keep uploading new videos every week
i though she is going to prepared dog meat
Oh no...she's getting old :(
I got a little emotional when I saw the live action Francis again... He was such a good dog...

Anyway! Thank you Chef for the great recipe again!
...the dog on her apron sometimes moves its mouth. Sometimes it doesn't, just to make you feel like you're losing your sanity even more.

How diabolical.
Legend is back
Francis was a good doggy... I miss him but all animals go to heaven so it’s ok :) It’s a bit bittersweet but I still love to watch ur videos. Chef is so adorable 💘
Great to see you again Chief, I know its hard without Francis but this year will be great for you. Love you Chief and Francis! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Long time no see.. I missed you..
Francis sure is irreplaceable... My heart breaks when I see stuffed doggy over there...
Wow, I love this recipe, it's so delicious! Cooking with Dog is the best channel!
This made me smile and cry at the same time seeing Francis! So good to see the chef back in action! <333   LOL at 3:46 I died when Francis said "otherwise Tai becomes too firm like GUMMY BEARS"
So lovely to see you! Thank you for coming back! ❤
I leave in Niigata-city,but I am not japanese. Because of you I learned how to cook for my husband and kids. Thank-you 🙏🙏
Thank you so much chef, we all miss Francis dearly <3
日本語のコメントがない(・Д・)
久しぶりのクッキングウィズドック嬉しい😆
P.S. To see you laugh is such a wonderful sight!
Just subscribed a few hours ago..  I didn't expect you'd upload today, but I'm happy you did.
I am so happy that there is a new Cooking With Dog episode.
I miss Francis...he seemed like a good dog.
鯛の昆布締め、大好物なので動画を上げてくれてありがとうございます。
The colour of that piece of fish was unreal! It must have been supremely fresh...😙
Nice to see you again, Chef ❤
Missed you guys so much miss Francis Hope you are well Chef <3
Oh! Francis!

Also - Oh! A fascinating new way to cure fish! Bream... it appears that here in Finland, there are some types of bream locally, so it means I only need to order the kombu. \o/
The talking apron! I love this and it made my week wonderful thank you so much Francis and Chef!
Thank you for coming back
Absolutely beautiful. Thank you for coming back 😊
finally.... I was waiting for the new recipe! thank you for uploading <3 can't wait the other new recipes

your continuation of this show even after francais' passing is really wonderful and inspiring, I love this show so thank you for continuing it.
Chef. Your style and perfection is so obvious watching you. It looks so effortless and that's the sign of a great cook. I'm glad Francis is still with us in voice and spirit.
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
I've missed your videos 💚
わぁ 美味しいそう！❤️（＾_＾）
love reusing the kombu in oden for sure 8)
I still love how the Francis drawing on the apron has the mouth move when the host-voice talks~ Thanks for the recipe, chef!
Francis 😳😍  thank you for the recipe!!! I'd be making this tomorrow 🤗💕
Good evening, 
Greetings from Germany, your Videos have bin giving us ideas to cook at home. Especially my Daughters like watching them.

We do liked Francis alot and miss him. We wish good Health and please Keep Cooking.
Kombu is really expensive here so a recipe like this is perfect, where you get to use it for one thing and then make dashi out of it! And I love cured fish too~
Strange question...would you be able to make a video showing how to make Suama, non glutinous rice mochi? I haven't seen a cooking video for it anywhere.
I miss so much japanese food... :(
And I really want to know the recipe from the coming soon dish xD
Could you make shumai next? Heard it is harder to make as the skin is more delicate than gyoza skin.
Nice to see you again!
I love this channel. Francis is greatly missed but never forgotten 💜 thank you chef!
I miss you two! I'm happy that Chef is doing well, and I miss sweet Francis. This looks so yummy!
Francis is in doggy heaven?!?!?
When did he pass away????
I'll miss him!!!
No wonder she have a stuffed Francis...
Happy Lunar New Year ... wish your health and happiness in 2019.. thanks for this great video 💕
Francis is such a cute doggy!!! I miss him a lot!
Hope that chef will be healthy and can share more delicious recipes with us!
Take care!
I love her! And I miss Francis!
Welcome back, Chef!  Missed your videos.  Miss Francis  as well....he was a wonderful dog.  Looking forward to your next  video!
That made me so frickin sad, I was actually brought too tears.
we missed you! glad to see a new recipe around, it is nice seeing you laugh
I’m not cry. It’s just tears of joy (｡･ ^ ･｡)
This was different, I enjoyed it thank you chef!
I love your videos! Glad to see them again.
Please make more videos. I really love your cooking show ^_^
Poor Chef! Thanks for these videos! I like the music when the dish is ready to serve. :D
Lovely! This was so much fun to watch and made me smile on a rainy day. Thank you so much for this video!
Glad to see you again, chief...
Welcome back! We missed your videos.
Oh my! 0:20 tus seaweed is so big
I love kombujime, I feel like lots of people dont really know what it is, but its definitely one of the technique that can apply widely in different cuisine
Thank you for this recipe. I love your videos❤️😊
Good to see you, chef! The little bit at the beginning with Francis had me emotional ❤
I must say, I love the tiny trays chef uses in the kitchen. They're small and cute and come in handy for someone living on their own.
whoa it freaked me out when I realized apron Francis is talking!
this is the BEST channel on YouTube!
I’m so glad you’re posting!! I love these!!!
Very delicious meal! Good work chef !
You guys should make Mochi and also make boba/ bubble tea 🍵
First, thank you
Second, im ready to another new video which mean i want more. :P

御免なさい.シェアさせてください！ 本当にありがとうございます:;(∩´﹏`∩);:
Chef is back! Thanks for the great recipe! Also, I have a request: could you do a special episode or post about the different cutting techniques used in Japanese cooking (sasagaki, rangiri, mentori, etc)? 何時もの通りにありがとうございます！
Chef 👩🏻‍🍳is so cute ☺️☺️☺️
Miss u <3
I regret not finding this channel for so many years. :( but at least i found it now eventhough francis isnt here anymore...
とっても美味しそうですね！昆布大好きなので見ているだけでよだれが出そうです🤤次回も楽しみにしています（先週娘と肉じゃが作ったところです…このレシピが出たらまたやってみます！）寒いので皆様お体お気をつけてください！

Nice to see you guys again
목소리가 너무 좋다 힐링~healing~
I love this video :)
Your English is easy to understand.
あなたの英語は聞き取りやすい。
Whatttt? Francis on her apron talks and moves! Has it always been like that?
Hi long time no see
I'm a little delirious with a cold right now, but this looks sooo good.
I really miss Francis
anyone noticed the talking dog on the apron ?
ワンコは、2代目に引き継がないのですか？？？
グッキングウイズぬいぐるみ！！！！！！
A fresh one!
😍😍❤❤👍👍🇪🇸🇪🇸
welcome back
久しぶりに拝見しました。美味しそう！
シェフも相変わらず可愛らしくてホッコリしますね。
私は刻み昆布を使って、自分で釣ったメバルやセイゴ（スズキのチビ）を昆布締めにしています。
あ、これは昆布和えですね
昆布も全部食べちゃう、横着メニューです。
This video is very intense..
❤️
Miss you
i remember when i watched her videos a couple years back with the dog and when i found out her dog died i got sad ndammxks everytime i see the dog i just- ))):
that does look very tasty!
約７年前のビデオの、最後の画面で入院とリハビリを受けられるとのお知らせがあったが今はお元気でいらっしゃること、ホッとしてます。お料理ビデオがいつも参考になってます🙏
delicious
I hope you continue to make videos! I love seeing you pop up on my subscriptions list
Cool
Looks yummy!
I miss francissssssssss..... a lot..... the host of this show.... why don't adopt other Dog... and my suggestion of name would be Theodor ... Hi my name is Theodor the new host of this show....
Japanese gravlax?
Is that grey dog a doll?
May one make the impermanent suggestion than Frances is not eternal and a replaceable is permissible?
Please don't stop making videos! For years Ive visited your channel, finding a soothing effect in how you cook , Ive made a few of your recipes and i love them, every single one turn to be perfect! Greetings from Mexico :)
This is one of the first YouTube channels I ever followed. I Will always miss Francis but I'm glad Chef keeps going & looking lively and happy. We love you!
Did anyone see the baby picture at the very back? I wonder if Chef's daughter had a baby...
Please don't ever stop. You are an international treasure.
I'd wait forever to see Chef and her Francis Talking Apron and hear Francis' voice. How I just love this channel. 💖💖💖xxxooo
I know the New Year is a bit later than ours in the west but:
HAPPY NEW YEAR🌟🎊🎉🎇🎆 FROM CANADA 🍁
JENN 💖
The Chef is really lucky to have an adorable and sweet companion like Francis. Having a dog brings fun into anyone's life. ( except for those who do not like dogs or are allergic, if either of these are you I'm so sorry for your loss)
THE,,, APRON,,,  T A L K S
a recipe AND restaurant etiquette?! goodness you're really giving us a wonderful video, chef and francis!
Thank you for continuing to share these unique Japanese recipes. I don't think there's anything else on YouTube that has Japanese home cooking so professionally presented! I've been following since 2013, but was shocked to find there are videos dating back to 2008!

While Francis will always be in our hearts, I hope you'll find another canine host not to take Francis' place, but to continue bringing joy for us fans of your channel :)

I wish you well and please keep up the great work!
We missed you! Thank you for the new video!
I especially liked the dog on the apron talking. Nice extra touch
Please chef come back with the regular videos.. this is the best channel in the world!!!!!
oof i really dont like the premiere feature, i always think there is a new video and then i forget when it actually comes out
Worth the wait....
loved your vids, chef. 

Happy New Year!
am i high or did the dog on the apron talk
I LOVE YOU CHEF! Thank you for teaching and sharing your time with us. Ganbatte!
When chef san posted vids again but without Francis, I cried a river. 
The Francis on the apron is still telling us steps to happy Japanese cooking, and ultimate Japanlish too 😂
Coloca Legenda em português tia....
This is wonderful.  Love this chef and the man speaking.  Great technique
i always loved how delicate your recipes look chef, greetings from México!
I just watched your ramen recipe and I just read that you had an accident. I know it happened years ago but I am so happy that you have recovered so well. I am going to watch all of your videos ❤️❤️❤️
I love the chef! Keep up the good work! <3
Please don’t stop !! I always waiting for your latest videos.. and i really love your recipes, always come as a single or smaller batch, simple and tasty.. 

Greetings from Indonesia!!!😍
That's so cool....I love this recipe! Great job! 😃👍
Ok I know I’m not high (yet) but at 2:05 her dog on her shirt was moving its mouth while speaking.
I'm so glad you're still making videos. I love your recipes!
Soon I'll move in a big city with several Asian restaurants, and I'm more than ready to try your more recent recipes!
you deserve so much more subscriber and view !!
your videos are what inspired me to cook healthy and  yummy meals! :) will you be selling any more of the Francis bento boxes in the future? much love from the USA ♡
Friends don’t let friends double dip 😆
The pepper things look like okra
Looks so delicious. I will definitely try this recipe this weekend 😋

Edit: Can’t wait for the next video
Thanks for sharing your recipe ☺️💕💕💕
I have never tapped the play button this fast when i saw your new video!😍😍
Someone get chef a cold beer to go with her Kushikatsu 😁
I'm still crying while looking at the Francis doll
The dog in the apron moves its mouth! At 1:23 Also at 3:56,  and through  the video☺, nice apron! 
So sorry to hear about Francis!😯. Our sharpei , Sack, our first dog,  also  left 6 months ago,  and we still miss him dearly.  
I love the way you explain and  prepare your food.   This will  be my first Japanese  dish .  
Love and regards from Guatemala
We love Chef and Francis! Thank you for sharing with us! ❤️
I love Cooking with Dog! I use to watch this channel years ago. Good to know its still going strong!
Oh wow, if it wasn't for the etiquette tip I totally would dip it twice, thanks!
looks soo good!!! thanks for the recipe and many grettings from Santiago de Chile!! we love you!! <3 <3 <3 <3
I appreciate so much. I love her who is always calm and cooks cleanly ♥️
Give that woman a beer!!! 
Amazing recipe :) fantastic as always
The kushikatsu looks awesome! B-)
Thank you so much. ,
Miss your cooking a lot.
We miss you, Chef! Happy New Year <3
Someone get Chef her beer!
<:')  Sadly my timezone doesn't match too well with live broadcast, but I'll look this up after waking up. I'm sure this will be gorgeous. 

Can't wait, but I have to ^^;
Happy New Year! May this be a happy and fruitful year.
Nice! I will try it. I miss Francis, but he will always be in my heart and all of this channel's fans. Greetings from México chef. ありがとう!
Happy new year, Francis and Chef! ❤️
Chef you are just so cute! Francis, thank you for your narrations ~! (:
We missed you so much! My family loves the dishes I learned how to make from watching your videos! It is so nice to see you making new videos!! Thank you for all that you have done and continue to do. I watch and rewatch your videos all of the time. Can't really find cooking shows on TV that are like yours. So many people appreciate what you do, I just never got the chance to tell/write you that.
Chef I love your videos so much! I remember watching The Melonpan video because I was obsessed with the stuff, (still am too), watching you cook has always brought me great joy and I hope you cook for many years to come! Love your work! Take care
So excited that I was able to watch this video. I miss you all <3
Wonderful!!!
Thank you very much for sharing.
大阪に行ったときはたくさんある串カツ屋さんの中から、パン粉が細かくて具材にしっかりついた串カツのお店を選ぶようにしています👏
そのほうが美味しいと思っているからです😄この串カツもとっても美味しそう！
Love Chef and Francis. This looks delicious!
Happy new year, Chef! Thank you for another wonderful recipe. I hope the coming year brings you lots of joy and happiness!
Love Talking Francis on Chef's apron!  :)
I just realized the shirt talks sometimes XD.
I hope you will be better ! !! I like as much as possible your lovely channel. 
I did some dish from your channel and I'll never forget the regretted Francis ! RIP Francis <3
Awe so happy you uploaded again! :)
That looks awesomely delicious! Yum! :D
This channel makes my heart happy ❤️
6:50 lol I love how they talked about double dipping.  As a kid I used to sneak and double dip my carrot in ranch when my mom wasn't looking <3  This channel is my favorite:)
A tip for an ingredient to use: Mochi. You know these hard mochis which are for cooking? Fry them as a kushikatsu skewer. I had one of these in Osaka and it tasted amazing. Maybe you will need to cook them a bit beforehand so you will get it onto the skew?
The new music is cool but I will miss the Chopin
Love this show! make me think of my good time I had travelling in japan some years ago. Now I know how to make this at home and maybe arrange some small party with this (Still have an urge to do cuisinary tour @ Osaka again lol) 

Thank you and Happy New Year!
I'm late! I love the video though! Looks so yummy :D
WELCOME BACK CHEF I MISSED YOU
When I was still a child Cooking with Dog was one of the first youtube channels that I ever found. I still make your custard frequently! I am so happy to see new videos and even without Francis I love them.
Please keep making more videos! I look forward to every one : ) cooking with dog has been something ive looked forward to when i had nothing else, i owe chef and francis a lot!! the whole CwD team are my saviors thank you for the amazing food and videos!!
Thank you for continuing to make these videos. They are the highlight of my month.
I got to try this in Dotonbori last week and it was so good! So happy this channel decided to cover the recipe :)
It's always such a joy to watch your videos! They always make me so happy :D
Chef can you make a video to explain how to sharpe a santoku with a whetstone?
It looks delicious! I love the tips about courtesy added at the end too, it’s always good to let people know about proper etiquette when sharing with others :) someone get chef a beer!!
So good to see you again Chef! <3
I'm so glad you're finally back.
I love the video but I have a question. Let's say we don't have the ingredients to make the sauce, will ponzu also work as a good substitute for the sauce?
I always seem to miss your videos because of time zones, and i see iv missed a lot, so i'm gonna go back and watch the ones I haven't seen ;-)
OMG Francis on the apron opened its mouth! and please continue to make more videos!
thank you for the recipe! now i can make it for my friends since the restaurant we go to serves beef and she can't have it.. and make as many kushikatsu with different ingredients!
Missed you Chef. Love the video.
I never noticed the apron talks
Just noticed Francis speaking from chef’s apron!
Glad to see you're well. Thanks for the videos!!
Oh, just find out Chef is back!
Wow Chef is looking as beautiful as ever!
エプロンの犬たまに口動いてて作りどうなってるか気になる
My very favorite YouTube channel !!! 💕 Thank you for uploading another delicious recipe
I can imagine how good this deep fried food is <3

#AH-mAzinGgg!!!!!
Have a beautiful awesome new year Chef and Francis! Love your videos!!
Please adopt another Francis!!! I miss Francis by your side!
久しぶりに拝見しに来ました！
薄衣でサクッと美味しそうですね♡お腹がすいてしまいましたよ(笑)

フランシスのママがお元気そうで嬉しいです。
I love this channel! I hope you're well Chef
I love the light breading, it's not thick with flour but just enough and the flavour of the fried ingredient pulls through. Good thing my family doesn't mind double dipping
Oishiii so🌸
So happy to see you, subscribed almost 10 years ago!
Oishiiso! 🤤
Thank you for continuing making videos! Looks delicious and I can’t wait to try doing it myself
I really love all of your video 💕💕💕
I LOVE YOU CHEF 💗 Will watch you amazing videos forever
Lovely video! Will definitely make this recipe soon!
This looks amazing!! Happy you are back and sharing your cooking, wish you Happy New Year Francis😍😍🍾🍾🎊🎊
My friend you cook 👩🏻‍🍳 with LOVE 💕
Give chef a beer!
Chef is so cute, holy shit.
This show makes me so happy!!
I missed you Chef! Happy New Year!!
Looks amazing! I can’t wait to one day tour japan aka eat my way through japan. Until then I’m going to make this. ❤️🥘🐕
New recep, proper way to cook, nice and skillful chef, and sooting yet gently of Francis voice over. Oh yess lawrd... I'm ready to be mesmerize.
Great work, keep it up!
FINNA SIT HERE AND WAIT TILL THIS SHIT PREMIERS! WHO'S WITH ME?!!?!?!
Looks delicious, I will try this.  Thank you for the clear and easy to follow instructions!
Another lovely video! Thanks Chef! I love watching you cook, it's so wholesome :D
I really like this channel and it's content. But this is getting weird and awkward. I get it that Francis is missing and he was an important part of the show. But that's life and it's already been 2 years. Chef is great, the videos are quality content and and "Francis' voice" is staying the same. Why bother to animate a speaking dog on an apron or doll?  I think it's time to move on. Rest in peace previous Francis.
Chef I swear you look younger every video
Thank you so much! i loved the video!
I love japan and this program food
Individual dipping saucers are sanitary too
yeheey! a new video! <3
do your best
have a beer with me Chef!
i love this channel, the best!
Happy New Year Chef!🎉😃
We love you chef!
damn francis
I love this channel!
I'm still waiting for your new videos. It's so good I like it ><
できたての串カツは絶対に美味しいですよね♪
後揚げてる時の音も美味しい！(*´-`)
今年もそろそろ終わりを迎えていますが、風邪に気をつけて動画楽しみにしています♪(*´꒳`*)
Hummm... delicious! ^-^♡♡♡
サクサクしていてすごく美味しそう！
カナダで串カツのお店へ行ったけどイマイチでした
海外で日本の味は無理なのかなーと改めて思っていたところに、嬉しいシェフのビデオ更新！ありがとうございます😊
頑張って作ってみます
コメントでお孫さんの写真のこと見ました
おめでとうございます㊗️
Thank you for another wonderful video
Watch the first 5 minutes of food wars anime   pierade dried sardine strawberry jam against peanutbutter squit

Complimenti... Folletto Magico
たいへんに可愛い、わんちゃん死んじゃったのですか？
久しぶりにテレビ見て。
What a unique accent XD
Okay but did anyone notice the dog on the apron was talking whaaat the mouth was moving tho
Anything deep fried is good
Love your videos can you make the Japanese version of the egg salad sandwiches and different assortment since some wish to enjoy and experience the infamous egg sandwich from Japanese convenience stores.
Yummy... Francis.... happy new year.
I have a cold ):! Edited I don't have a cold anymore
i miss you !
😍 love it
Good to see you again!
❤ thank you
あいしいいいい😋😋😋😋😋
3年前に日本語がぜんぜんわからずに、このチャネルを見ていた。今は日本語を勉強していて、まあ日本に留学したことも
あります。やっと今、chef のはじめの話がわかりました。キセキだなっと思っています。
それと、色々な料理のビデオを作ってくれて本当にありがとうございます😊😊😊
very nice video.  happy new year, chef!
初コメントです(^^)
いつも楽しみに、動画を拝見しております。
最初に拝見したときから思っていたのですが、英語のナレーションのイントネーションが、私の中学校時代の先生のそっくりなんです(^O^)／
懐かしい思いで見ています（聞いています）ので、今後共応援していきますね！
I love when you make new videos!!! I would sooooo love to try your food it looks so heavenly !!!!
長い間待っていたので、料理をやめるな。私はこのチャンネルが大好きです。ありがとうございます
I've been patiently waiting!!
今日はないんだなぁ笑
Thank you Chef for the recipe. It looks delicious. Akemashite omedeto gozaimasu.

🤤
How about a simple, quick instant ramen hack?  Make shoyu ramen at home in 30 minutes or less?  (Or shio, miso, ...?)
Good to see your vids again
I will miss Francis
Welcome back!
Francis is the best, I need to have a cute animal on my channel lol maybe a sloth?  🥰
いつも楽しみにしています。参考になります＾＾
シェフのお料理大好きです。もっともっとたくさん動画をアップしてください。みんな、シェフのお料理を楽しみにしていますよ！😃神戸で戴いた串カツによく似ています。丁寧な下処理が上品に仕上げるコツですね！😄
Have they tried animating a cartoon Francis?
Ooo deep fry yumm ♡♡
It’s nice to see the ‘Chef’! 🐾🦋✨💫🌟💝💐🌹🎀🦋
I like the new song
It was funny, was watching some old videos hoping Chef was holding up alright and here we are now, shes fine and well and making more videos
is this different from tempura?
HOORAAAAYYYYY!!!!!! 🐶👩🏻‍🍳♥️
It look very similar with tempura, is the same thing?, what is the difference then?
I think they should adopt a dog from a shelter to be the new host. Maybe a Shiba Inu.
I thought this was going to teach me how to cook dog.
Is Francis black???
Where’s the dog tho? Is he ok?!!
Oh my God I missed you videos, " dont try this at your local laundry" that's funny
Don't mind me just putting my Octopus in the laundry
Did anyone else notice the dog on chef's apron talking? 😍😍😍
Your wasabi face is adorable! Love your content. Keep up the good work!
'Please do not try this at your local public laundry' LOL
Chef looks so satisfied when she put the octopus on the meat hook!
I miss you so much.  You keep getting more pretty every time I see you. 
    Thank you so much for bringing us great recipes with your meticulous style.
Glad to see you back chef! <3
Octopus is such a pretty color when it's cooked.
I miss you Francis 🐩🐩
Love it! ❤️ My favorite way to eat octopus is Galician. You must dunk it before boiling then eat with potatoes, olive oil, salt and paprika on a wood platter. We call it polbo à feira or in Spanish pulpo a la gallega 🐙
Wasabi...!

I have such high levels of cute aggression right now.
Oh no chef that's too much wasabi
the octopus was such a beautiful color after boiling!
I love chef
Last time I watched one of these videos was 7 years ago, and the accent is the same.
I love that apron!
I actually hate octopus but I'm still watching
i was today years old when i noticed that the dog on the apron was  narrating  lol
0:53 - When it's Dec 1st and you 100%'d NNN.
Chef, thank you for these wonderful videos! I have been following this channel since 2009. And I keep coming back to them. Today I made Nikuman. Perfect for the cold weather. Delicious!
Thank you for this recipe!
Long time viewer since 2012.
Good job Chef and Francis (Producer)
Lol those sloshing sounds. Good vid 👍.
Thank yo very much for this cooking technique chef & Francis! I've been wanting to get some fresh octopus but no idea how to properly prepare it. I'll be sure to try this!!
HANK?! NOOOO! (Finding dory XD)
Hello, Cooking with Dog ! 
Can you please make Kare Pan ?
I would definitely love to eat some ! 
Thanks 😊
"Don't try this at your local laundry" 😂
Would have loved to see the size of that octopus! It looks like it was huge!
So good to see another video from you, chef-san! Hope you are doing well!
I LOVE octopus, but it's so hard to find fresh octopus (or any seafood) in my landlocked area. And as delicious as it is, i'd honestly rather leave that rubbing and cleaning process to the people at the restaurant!
I love Cooking With Dog so so much ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks for sharing! I will definitely use this video if I ever make Takoyaki.
'please do not try this at your local public laundry' 😂😂
Kushikatus is coming up??!?!?!?!?! I'm ready now! HAHAHA
HELLO! I AM A NEW VIEWER AND I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS.
I only wanted to say this because I see y'all just got restarted making videos again and just wanted to ensure y'all know your videos are getting traction and being recommended. Please do more!!
Can you do move videos involving bento boxes? I bought 3 bento boxes for when I travel. I would love to see more recipes for me to make and try when I am on a flight. Thank you so much and I look forward to more of your videos.
Aaaa.. Love all your recipes! :D 

I love youuuuuuu..^^
New sub here!Really interesting cooking show! 👍🙏🍽💎
It's great to see Chef eating and smiling at the end of her preparations. Oh wait, too much wasabi? Ha ha. Your videos make my day.
Thank you for the video, and i love the channel too 😍😍😍
Local public laundry, you're killing me 😂😂😂😂
This was a very funny and educational video. Thank you Chef for showing us the cleaning part, it looked very unpleasent.
As always I adore this video!
I miss youuu! So glad to see the video 😁❤️
Gracias!
Felices fiestas!!
Abrazos desde la Ciudad de México
We missed you Chef!!! Pls come back with more videos...
RIP Francis... u might be gone but not forgotten..

~Initialy i was wondering, why she didnt cook with him siting beside her like usual?. Instead they replace him with a doll..?

Then i found out that the intro of francis was re-used from their old videos as Francis had already passed on.. RIP
Chef could you please do a japanese style pickle veggie recipe or a japanese style kimchi recipe,  I would really appreciate you sharing those recipes. Thank you.
Chef, could you tell us a recipe  with the remaining bonito flakes and kombu kelp from the dashi stock?
I love octopus sashimi, but its so expensive😣
So cute how Francis (on chef’s apron) moves his mouth like he’s talking ♥️
So wonderful to see you. I love you! Keep vids coming please!
great video! you're a legend!
Love your videos, chef! <3 I've missed you!
I like how Francis was not animated. Thank you for all your beautiful work.
I used to follow the channel a long time ago but after Francis passing I thought it's over. Some other video played the little theme tune and I got reminded of the show, looked it up again and I was surprised to see that it continues on and the format with the plush dog just makes it even better! I subscribed again! I love octopus, btw! :D
Missed the primmer... but... anyways love your videos.... wasabi 😂
Chefs face when the wasabi hits her is so cute
So interesting to see you, Chef, clean & cook the giant octopus. Keep up the good work! We LOVE your videos and recipes very much. Be safe! 💕🐙💞😄
That octopus arm looked sooo delicious... I'll definitely try it sometime!
I love your videos!!! Will the cooking with dog bento boxes come back? or are they gone forever?
WOW! That octopus arm is giant!!!
Looks delicious!! 💕💕
ah, this video's relaxing as always
Please, dont try this on your local laundry! Because will soapy and poisonly to eat xD
2:18 francis's mouth moved. Freaky LOL
I love your videos, thank you and keep up the hard work!
OMG it looks so good, so fresh. I wanna try it so bad!!!
My favorite sashimi is octopus so I clicked asap when I saw the video
Please keep posting video. I want to know if you're doing well
Glad to see new video from you❤❤
Man it's been a minute since I watched this channel
The laundry called security when I washed my octopus. They have no sense of humour. 😀
That's (🤢) Great (🤮)
Madame Chef's face was so cute when taking out the octopus arm from the boiling water!
Ponzu sauce is good, too!
It's so good to see you back, chef!
Francis' doll made me sad 😭😭 i miss him so much!
So tentacle is goey and exudes white liquid when rubbed vigorously......hmmmmmm......

Btw if you overcook an ocopus, just boil it again until total cooking time become approx. 35 minutes. Then you'll get tender braised octopus.
Octopus is such an underrated and underappreciated seafood! I hate how hard it is to find even at my local korean market!
Wow the tentacle is as big as chef's arm😱😱😱
yummy~!!
Sensei kawaiii... Hisashiburi.. Aitakatta iou
I was really excited and I saw those gooey stuff and I'm like, hell no, I ain't doing it.
美味しそうですねー！
なかなか自分で茹でることはないですけど、茹でダコを買うよりも新鮮で味が違うのでしょうね！
見ていても楽しかったです。ありがとうこざいます😊
Hi Chef! It's nice so nice to see you again!
I can't go out tonight, I have to wash the octopus... It actually looked nice as a hanging decoration! Nothing quite like a good wasabi rush.
👏👏👏❤💯
As a Greek i can relate to these foods. We absolutely love octopus and squid and practically all seafood...Since my studying of Japanese culture 20years ago, ive come to love such cooking and taste...
Saludos fraternos desde Bogotá Colombia disfruto mucho su canal
4:38 So cute! Kawaii! 😍😍😍
みなさん、外国の方ばかり(^-^)英語できません、日本人でーす❤️いつもみてます！真似をして何作っても美味しくて、大好きです！
最近🥕にんじんケーキにはまっています❗イロイロレシピがあって、どれにしようかあれこれやっていますが、にんじんケーキ作っていただけたら、とても嬉しいです😄🥕
これからも楽しみにしています⭐
Rest in peace Francis. <3
Francis speaking I love it 🥰
Chef-san is the cutest!
Wh...where's the old dog which was always on the counter?
I love how it feels like Francis is still here. Well, not here, but still existing on another plane. Honestly, I wish I had been allowed to deal with my best friend's death in a similar manner. It would have made the grieving process more bearable.
Love Cooking with Dog. Hello from Norway btw.
Love your videos. Please keep them coming.
The absolute best channel on youtube!
Please do a Pablo style cheese tart recipe! It would be great!
"premieres in 21 minutes" ;-;
Octopus looks so good to me. It's just such a dense piece of white flesh. It seems like scallop or shrimp, that you can get a satisfying bite from. I can never find it raw where I live though. It comes already steamed.
Octopus & Wasabi!! 😅 Chef made the Cutest face!! 🐙💖
Dog was talking on your apron. How did you do that?
食べたいです。。
蛸大好きです。。。😁
this video JUST got uploaded and there are comments from 10 hours ago??
Although the cleaning process did not look very appealing, the end result seemed scrumptious!
My seafood alergy really loves coming to bite me. That looks amazing! ;w; I hope you're okay after the Wasabi, Ma'am.
Love you as always Francis
I honestly don't think i have the fortitude to prepare it myself, but man calamari steak is one of my favorites. I get it every year on my birthday if i can.
Chef, do a recepie of chicken curry with ingredients that can be founded outside of japan, i founded myself that you can make it with 3 to 5 tablespoons of all-purpose flour, and 3tbsp of curry powder and 2tbsp of butter, that's for replacing the curry tablets
I'll try this next time I'm doing laundry thx for the tip
She is so cute ❤❤
I love your videos Cooking with Dog!
Harumaki recipe please :)
omg... don't get me wrong I LOVE Your Videos but the rubbing in salt part almost make me puke... 
But Still a great recepie
Yummm!!!😍😋
Hitting up my local countryside coin laundry, octopus akimbo, brb
関係ないけどタコは鉄腕DASHのマコちゃん思い出す
Wow, I would love to try the octopus! Yummy! 😋😉
this is my favorite hentai.
Man, I missed this show.
🤮
Thank you! I love your videos.
after long time miss you  and where is ur dog  ——shashipuri desh nay
Premiere => instant thumbs down
I've missed you!
Wasabi😂
Francis mouth on chefs appron is moving sometimes :D <3 what a nice touch
Is there a way to make tempura battered foods without wheat flour? I'm allergic to wheat and I really miss tempura. I'd so love to eat it again.
When the wasabi hits your nasal passages. 😖
please do a vid on how to microwave octopus
Francis lives on!
なんだか見てて面白い！！
Awwww chef so kawaii 😍
I know Francis can never be replaced, I've been through losing a dog in my family. My grandma and grandpa lost her, and though it took a while, they eventually got a new one. Not as a replacement, but as a something to turn the sadness into joy again. I guess what I'm saying is, as a viewer that misses Francis on this show, I wouldn't mind seeing a bright new face sitting beside you. I believe we as your viewers would never forget Francis if you got a new puppy on the show, but would love them both dearly through each and every one of your videos in time. Anyway, I'm glad to see you making videos again, we missed you <3
i enjoy your videos a lot
We miss you Francis 💗💗💗💗💗
Chef is so かわいい ❤️❤️
aw chef at the end xD
I love you, you're like my mom 💞💞
Oh,,i think this is damnable dishes!!!! Guys did eat sushimi or octopus?? How was that taste?
Yes! Love 🐙
Just a question
if you are cooking the octopus, why does it need to be sashimi grade? Is it because it's technically not fully cooked? :o

Thanks for reading!
1:08 I completely agreed not to do this at the local coin-op laundry, not because we're worried about the laundry machines... But rather we wouldn't want the octopus to get washed in the same tub that the homeless dude just did his yearly laundry session.
あー美味しそうーーーーーーたべたい
Thank you!
Not even two minutes in and I've decided to leave this to the professionals, ha ha!
Brava! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🤤🤤🤤😋😋😋美味しいそう！
What a cute Wasabi face! ❤️
looks good!
it would be easier to put it in the washing machine
Looks so good 😛
🤢
Welcome back! 😊
https://bit.ly/2S9Tzd7?-fattt-lossss-cuttingggg
that is one giant octopus arm
I'd be really interested on Chef's take on imomochi (Hokkaido potato mochi)
Looks amazing
Been binge watching cooking with the dog, I wonder what happened to the poodle? Is he alright?
メリークリスマスおばあちゃんがいます！
それはジャパノロジのエピソードのようなものです💕👏
Cooking without dog 🐕
I hate to ruin this pure and positive comments section, but I could only think of hentai with that tentacle and gooey substance... and those sounds...
How to wash your slimey gooey dead pet lol
👍 good work as usual
Chef is so cute! Thanks!!! Looks so yummy!!!!
Please! Buy new poodle/dog...It will be really cooking WITH DOG...
Love it!! 🙌🙌
I’m so so happy to see another video from you! I missed you guys and hope your doing well!
Yummy !!!
海外のコメント多い！
ベリーナイスな動画でした！
次も楽しみです！
It's been a few years since I've watched these videos. Just wondering if anyone knows if Francis is still alive and well
😋
Merry Christmas
I love the taste of octopus 😖 but there is no way I could rub it with my bare hands like that! I would need to use some kitchen prep gloves so I don't have to touch all that goo.
Hi
Sorry, did you just tell me one salt was better than another for cleaning the gunk off of an octopus?
Will Chef ever get another dog?
Very interesting, never seen something like that! But also a little bit creepy!
2:36 fascinating and beautiful color that comes out of the octopus into the water, does anyone know if those are carotenoids contributing the color? Perhaps the carotenoids work their way up the food chain from algae, to small algae eaters, to eventually fish and then the octopus... bio-accumulating en route?
So cool
This looks good!
Where is the poodle
oooof HUNGRY
What happened to the dog?
Why video comes so late......why.......
Cool!
I think anybody that would eat something like this is either crazy or demon possessed. This includes all shell fish crab which is the sea tarantula. Squid and eel. This is sick!
Aw. Who's the new puppy? 😊
MARINA
It's ethical to eat octopuses because most species of octopus eat other members of their species.
You are back!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Love you so much!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Kisses and hugs from Brazil!
Cool!
Step 1: Put it on the back of a taxi
When I was a kid my dad bought a big batch of small squid and used our clothes washer to clean them. It worked great but our clothes smelled like squid for a month.
Wait didn't francias pass out?
いつも動画を拝見してます！
集合体恐怖症なのですがこの動画のサムネって変えられないでしょうか？
cookingwithdogさんの他の動画を探している時に目に入ってきて辛いです泣
Oh goodness I missed watching this show... Aw all the poodle items in the kitchen :3 I wish I could cook this, my area is not good for fresh sea foods. It looks tastey.
It’s wonderful everyone’s gonna love it
Is that a plastic knife?
They say that Octopi have neurons in their arms similar to those in their brains. It makes me wonder if that piece of octopus is still thinking...
So excited!!! Sounds delicious!
Did the dog die?
Hi chef, pls make more cake recipes and cup cakes.
Circles wtf
ew
Octopus is so unappreciated where I live. You'd think living right at the Gulf of Mexico it'd be a common thing on restaurant menus. They're only sold here at the Asian grocery store from somewhere not even in the same continent. I sure miss eating them.
Lovely recipe, hope the dog is ok though
Don't do it!
Why she always show, dog already dead in opening video ?
Get profit from dead and sympathy ?
Chef still keeps her alarm at 4pm. It was a time to take a walk with Francis. We still miss Francis and want to keep making recipe videos! Thank you so much for your support!🐩👩‍🍳💗
somewhere up there. francis is meeting up with stan lee in heaven T_T
I am so happy to see your videos again.  The pudding looks delicious.  Love from America.  <3
Francis lives on!
No wonder Japanese people aren't worried about eating raw eggs! Look at how fresh they are! The chickens must be extremely healthy too!
the eggs must be really fresh
Thank you for this video. More please! Also, I hope you continue your Go Francis series someday. Those were a lot of fun and very informative.
Love this show! 😀👍
Aww I missed the premiere! That’s okay, you guys know I’ll watch every single video you guys put out. I have been for 10 years, and I won’t stop now! 💕✨🐩
I'm super excited! Love all the way from Latin America!!
I LOVE YOU CHEF!!!!!
Only time I will wait for a premiere ♥
Here in Mexico, specially in Guadalajara city we have a very similar dessert called "Jericaya", The only thing that changes is that here we using sweet condensed milk and natural milk.
Mom used to bake those for us on mugs 30 yrs ago, it reminded me of my childhood.
I'm not one for pudding, but this is the exception. This looked so delicious!! Maybe Francis's charm enhances any food? Awesome video as always ❤🍮
Wish there’s a easier and more affordable way to get this kind of high quality eggs safe for raw consumption in the U.S.
<3 you, Chef and Narrator...and of course, Francis.
I miss Francis so much!🦋
I started watching Cooking with Dog when I was 14, I am almost 26 years old now. I grew up with this channel, so when she said 「よかったね、フランシス！」 I suddenly got teary-eyed. I am sure that Francis is up in heaven, happy that you continue making recipe videos. His memory lives on this way. ♡
So happy to see you doing well, Chef!
I am so happy that you are continuing to make videos. Francis will continue to live on through you! <3
I think Francis would want his mommy to get another baby Francis.
Happy you’re doing well chef 💕 good to see you again
Wow! Those yolks are amazing! The eggs in Japan are so different from the eggs in the US
Yaaaas Francis!!!
Omg I'm crying cause I miss francis but I'm happy because of this video and francis' talking face on chefs apron 😢❤
Chef - san, missed you!! Glad to see you in good health.
This cheered me up a bit, thanks for this
Mr speaker and Mrs Chef love you and love FRANCIS, thank you for don't give up!
yay so happy! cant wait to see what recipes you'll be showing us next!
Omg how have I only discovered this
はじめまして！数年前に転勤で海外に引っ越した時、知り合いも少ない環境で寂しい時にCooking with Dogの動画を観て元気をもらっていました。
お利口なフランシス、とっても可愛かったです。
フランシスが亡くなってしまってとても悲しいですが、今の動画にもフランシスが生き続けていているのを感じます。これからも素敵な動画楽しみにしています😊
This pudding is beautiful and fresh wow I'm hungry😻😻😻

Rip good boy you are still and always will be loved 💖
おいしそう！作ることを楽しみにしてま〜す！プディングが好き( ◠‿◠ )
Love Chef and Francis and Ai too! What a great crossover!
Your videos always manage to bring me so much joy and happiness.
Oh yay! I enjoy Ai's channel too!
When people think of Japanese food they instantly relate it to "raw fish", but actually it's EGGS
i was looking forward to you're video
Hhmmm ... Looks yummy ... 😋😋😋
wow so nice, im a big fan of your channel, keep up the good work : )
美味しそう！！
(๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)
T_T Francis i miss you
I’m so glad you are still making videos, it must be very-very hard losing Francis❤️ I love to rewatch your videos and I adore this new idea of the talking shirt Francis! You put so much love and effort in your videos, it really shows through :) I’d love to see some vlogs of your daily life, too!
Good to see Francis again and even better seeing you chef! Hope you’re doing well!
A new segment? This video was incredibly enjoyable.

プリン美味しそう🍮今度日本へ行った時に中目黒へ行ってみます！

The pudding looked REAAAAL good! I’m so hungry now LOL 😂😍🍮
Ohhh perdi a live....Hugs from Brazil! Miss you Francis!

I buy this type of pudding is made in Paris Baguette. I like the strawberry flavored one. 🍮
I have too many eggs from my chickens! This is perfect!! Thank you Francis!
Small world. Youtubers know each other now.
Greetings from Sri Lanka. ..☺☺ really happy to see ur videos again.... hope to see more...

Doesn't matter if I eaten or not these delicious looking videos make me hungry

PUDDI PUDDI!!!!
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone from the Philippines and just like the cooking. Mabuhay at Salamat po sa panoorin para sa pagkain ng buhay. (Live and Thanks for watching for food life.)
I do not like the way the woman speaks, it's histrionic and really irritating.
I want to buy that apron 😍💖
Hi frances i miss you sooo much and i love you see your videos soon dont be late thank you alot for all nice videos which makes us happy and relax
I'M READY FOR THIS!!!
Where I'm from we call this dish "flan" it's sooo good <3 Wish I could go there and try it D: I wonder how much it is o.o cause i surely would eat them out of stock
美味しそうなぁ〜！食べたい！
白身を使わないのですねΣ( ﾟДﾟ) 
お土産に出来るようなプラカップのプリンの作り方を教えて下さい
Looks good, and I'm glad to see you're still holding up! Take care of yourself! I want pudding now...
Great video as always 😊❤
I love this channel so much
Love this new style and so glad that the chef do more exercise!  We want to her to be healthy and be with us as long as possible!
認知症の母を看取る間見れていなかったので…山歩きが出来るほどお元気になられて、良かったですね。
03:19 Well, not only do we get to learn about pudding, but we get a pretty host as well! 
Honestly those eggs are the most amazing thing though... I can't believe they can actually put wood skewers in them, & they not bust... that's crazy.
Your Pinterest account is awesome!
arf, arf
A convection oven with steam is actually a "Combi" oven, combination of oven and steamer.
these look so good
The pudding looks so good 😍
https://bit.ly/2S9Tzd7?-fattt-lossss-caloriessss
Great Episode please make more!
My mom makes great custard pudding, but really, this looks a lot better (don't tell her I said that)
What a great video! Lots of fun
山歩きいいですねーいい季節ですね😋歩くとごはんがよりおいしいですね🍙💓
HEY IT'S AI!!!!!!!
Makes me smile every time i see the t shirt
yayy we love you Francis !
Hi Francis...i'm your fan since long time ago
I wish the woman speaking English would speak normally instead of exaggerated form of speaking.
Almost reminds me of flan 🍮
I miss Francis too!
esto es demasiado triste para mi ;(
How is that yolk soo firm?
Excellent video, I enjoyed it a lot :)
LOOKS DELICIOUS!
I have never heard such a subtle accent. like 90% of the sentence would go by and she sounds exactly like an American.
Looks so good! Yum yum YUM!!!!
❤️
Cook-ing with dog 🐶
This reminds me of My Boss, My Hero, Tomoya Nagase, and Tokio — Sorafune. Ah, the memories...
Hiii
AHH I want
Omg I really want some!!!
We miss Francis too! And so happy to see Chef looking so well👩‍🍳 much love from Seattle! 💜
🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮
give me give me give me 
🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮🍮
64 degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius?
I personally know you can never replace Francis, but do you have any plans to get another dog? Not even for the show because it is Francis' show, but just for a pet.
PLEASE TAKE CARE CHEF! HOPE YOU ARE ALWAYS 元氣 😁
I want some pudding now!!
フランシス2代目、来て下さい。
Oh my god.......why videos come so late.......why?????
So they made flan?
Looks so yummy!
過敏性腸症候群の僕は黄身の脂肪分でお腹緩くなるみたい
Mmm now I needs me some puddin'
Mmmmm pudding!
hello everyone!
Chef needs a new pet.
delicious :)
😮
Incredible video footage! Here at Y&S FOOD! we really like to check out this form of content. We create Travel & Food movies as well, across the globe, and so we are constantly looking for inspirations and vision. Thank You.
Lovely
COOL!
YAY! How do I join chat?
Ugh. The premiere feature 🤢
I love the chef. I love Francis(rip). And I am happy if she still can make money with the brand. The video is informative.
But.
This is not really "Cooking with Dog", the channel I subscribed to, anymore...it's more like watching other people slaughtering the brand for money, I especially hate the fake acting of that woman as if this is a kids tv show...
Plus the animated shirt gives me the creeps. If you need to show someone representing Francis, then better use the old doll of him.
Waiting for a great recipe!
Sorry, where is the dog?
Ai san is super cute, and I mean that in a totally creepy way.
I wonder what they do with all the left-over egg whites... o.o
Francis dies? O_O
These look do good! I hope the place does something with the egg whites, instead of wasting it
I love the videos and the pudding looks great. The talking shirt is creepy though 👻👻
Okay, so I´m really happy to see another video from cooking with dog. I miss Francis and I am glad to see Chef again... BUT I am really unhappy with the young woman (Ai) who I am pretty sure was hired as a spokesperson for the pudding company. She is so obnoxious and fake and her text is obviously skripted and blergh I just can´t with that. Very sorry but I realy did not like the video at all. I´m totaly okay with Chef making some money with addvertisement and stuff but this was horrible to watch and literaly made me cringe more than once.
Miss Chef probably has the hardest time making this videos. Every time she cooks she is reminded of her dog. I honestly think she should stop uploading, having sadness in you heart 
while your cooking can make it hard for you to have fun while cooking.
I know this is something I'll never have, and it's breaking my heart
How are u guys? Missed you
Unlike the Japanese Pudding was held the version in the Philippines are Leche Flan is a sweetness Filipino dishes and snacks on my desert only and among them to Leche Flan turns the place on Halo-Halo is the version of Kakigori on Summer Season. Lead us and Just like the cooking.
I don't know if the channel name "cooking with dog" is a very good channel name for an asian cooking channel.
Francis gets bored? I thought the dog was dead...!
...I honestly thought I'd never get a notification from you guys again. It's pathetic how emotional I am over such a sentiment.

But I don't care! Waaaaaaaaah, I miss you Francis! :c
FRANCIS is always in our hearts, thank you for don't stop this channel💖💖💖
The speaker and Mrs Chef are amazing. 👏👏👏
Chef and Francis, I have tears in my eyes. I've had a bit of a hard day and I'm pretty stressed, thought I'd go to bed early and watch some cooking videos to relax and you are here in my feed today! I have missed you. Xxx
Omg your voice is moving the dogs mouth!?!?!
It's been so long since I got a notification from your channel 😭
I've never made one of your recipes but they look so tasty. Maybe one day.. ❤️
Is it me or is Francis’s mouth moving on Chef’s Apron that was so cute! 1:45
Can we talk about the warped pan for a second XD I honestly didn’t know it was warped until they mentioned it at the end.

I was too concentrated on the food to notice 🤤😋
"The reason we are using the warped pan is because Chef dropped it on the floor before shooting.  Oops..." XD

Came here from JK news :p
Shouldn't watch this at lunch time when I haven't eaten breakfast yet. Too delicious looking for my empty stomach to handle.
Welcome back chef!
That looks so delicious!!! I'm happy to see another video from you. As long as you continue to enjoy making them, I hope you keep publishing them on YouTube :) Thanks for always making me smile ❤️
Chef, you and Francis have been a part of my life since 2008. Your smiling face and tasty food have gotten me through a lot of rough times. It makes me so happy to see that you haven't lost your joy for cooking.
so glad to see you back chef! I've missed your videos
Your video is so calming and wonderful! Thank you for everything you do Chef ~ (:
I was a bit curious about the pot earlier - apparently it was actually warped. Lol.

That aside, kudos for another video.
all my faves in one bowl... heavenly. I remember chef-san loved shrimps ^^
I have been watching your videos for years and she hasn’t aged one bit. Looking younger every time, I’m glad you’re posting again. Missed you guys! And Francis too ❤️😊
Chef thank you very much for sharing this, it will be my very first time trying this. So i hope i make it turn out well. :) All the love from California for you and the rest of the staff. ❤
So good to see you're back! I've missed your cooking channel and know you must miss Francis very much. He will always be in our hearts! Thank you for making your cooking videos again Chef!
The whole video, I was wondering why the pan was warped. So glad, and satisfied, that they explained why at the end haha.
Hello Chef-san and Narrator-san. Hope you are doing well. I missed your videos! ;)
Welcome back!🤗 this video makes me hungry!!😆
Ahh i love this channel so much~~ thank you chef!!
I love what you do so much! These videos are so inspiring and relaxing. Thanks for making them!
I was really happy to see Francis! 
Chef, your cooking is amazing as ever, you just brightened my day and I love the talking Francis apron! :)
christ I realized halfway through the video that Francis' mouth on chef's shirt was animated - 3spooky5me

I miss you Francis - never forget
i was so excited to see the notification for this video!
I love your cooking videos all of your videos has a sentimental value to me thank you for being my inspiration
Miss you Chef... happy to see your lovely face☺️ Wishing you happy & healthly always😘😘
That outro was funny, the chef is so precious. 😂
Nice to see that Chef is doing well. I love Cooking with Dog! 🐕 👩‍🍳
... Oh my gosh. Could it be...
Francis has been brought back to life! :'3 lol
Your food always seems delicious and recipes alright great and helpful Mrs. Chef (& Dog).
I made a mistake watching this beautiful video at night...now I'm super hungry & I want tempura 😅
I'm so happy to see more recipes from this channel!!
This is wonderful! I am so happy you are back. Special greetings from California!
Chef, you're looking well! Your hair is so cute! And this dish looks super yummy... Francis would be proud! Good to see you back in top form once again!
If my dog ever disobeyed my direct order to outlive me, I would crawl into his grave along with him and follow him to the other side. I keep thinking you're not coming back, but then you do, and it is such a testament to your strength. I don't think I could continue something like this if I lost my best friend -- you're amazing. You bring so much happiness, thank you.
Tendon means something else entirely in English :-)
Was brought here by JustKiddingNews. I remember watching your videos as a kid and the food always managed to make me hungry :)
This is probably one of the oldest cooking shows I’ve been following on YouTube! I can’t tell you how happy I was to see a new video was up! Can’t wait for more! 

I love you guys!!
Welcome back! We will always miss Francis, but so happy to see your channel revived! 😭🤗
always making me so hungry, have a great day Chef!! 💛
Thank you chef'! For still making the video

We miss you Francis! Hope you live well in heaven. 🙏🏻
Thank you so much for continuing your channel ❤️ We love you
Love the new music. Keep up the good work!
THE MOUTH—- ITS MOVING 


XD !!!
I love your idea to put bonito flakes into a tea bag for the donburi sauce!  I will try this for sure.
Love this; yummy!   Arigato gozaimasu !
E' bellissimo vedervi di nuovo all'opera e l'effetto di francis che parla nel grembiule è uno spasso: molto divertente. Sempre bravissimi ^_^
I couldn’t believe the notification! Thank you for the video, I hope there are more to come soon ❤️
I love this channel, they're so cute! Everytime I see their videos I get a happy warm feeling inside. すごい！
I’m so glad you are back.  Thank you for your recipe!!
Looks amazing!  Thank-you for sharing
Thank you for coming back!! 😭😍
I'm happy she is able to move on positively. Francis will forever be in our hearts ❤
i saw francis on the intro and was like :O time travel? old episode? new doggo? but francis still ded.
I love to hear from you and I love your channel, keep making such delicious recipes!
You are back !!!! Am so happy...miss you doggy 🐕
I am so happy to see a new video! We'll never forget or stop loving Francis! <3
The pan may be warped but it’s okay 
It adds character
You're baackkk! These videos are so relaxing and wonderful to watch, thank you for all that you do!
Wow :) This takes me waaay back. The original tendon recipe was one of the first oriental dishes I ever made :) I still have the photos :)
Tendon is nice, and yours look delicious. 
I personally prefer to eat tempura with salt and sansho peppers, along with  a side of rice or noodles.
I'm so happy to see a new video!!! I love this channel, and the food looks so good!
Ah, i Really miss the channel! I never know I could see it again on YouTube
I love this channel and I am so happy about this update! Thank you from the bottom of my heart <3.
Your videos are always so peaceful and relaxing. Even on stressful days I can take a few minutes to watch you cook and take enjoyment from the careful preparation of delicious food. Thank you for continuing these videos.
ALMOST ELEVEN YEARS.

I will never not love Cooking with Dog. Can't believe it's been almost a decade since I found this channel.
I'm excited for the octopus!!
Sugoi! Even soft-boiled egg turned into tempura. Nice recipe
The tempura looks so good! I want to try to make the tendon sauce at home, it looks very savory
I love every time they release a new video. And as much as I miss Francis, I love seeing how well Chef is doing. We love you!
I get so happy every time I see a new upload from you guys!
I love your channel..🤗 if you don't mind, Please accept my Request in the next video about cakes and sweets thank you ☺️

WHY IS THE APRON TALKING?!
Watching such a delicious dish being prepared by our favourite chef with francis makes me hungry!
That vein removing technique just change my cooking life.
Oh my gosh! Francis is talking on the apron!! I'm so happy to see your videos again
The opening of Francis instantly triggered my emotions.
ヨダレ出まくりです(*´▽｀)ﾉﾉ
お元気そうで何よりです♡
The narrative is the best! It's hilarious
We love you Chef! <3 <3 <3 This is a great recipe!
I JUST REALIZED THAT THE DOG ON HER APRON WAS TALKING!
I love tendon! Crispy and delicious!
Thanks for this I'm hungry now
Just realized Francis on the apron is talking ! :O
Chef you look absolutely radiant!! This looks amazing and I’m definitely making the sauce and tempura with available ingredients ^^
I think it's great that you guys are still making content! I was surprised at how far back your videos go. Looking forward to more videos.
i feel like she should be part of tasty japan
So good to see you again chef!!
I miss Francis and its other voice, I'm not a native English speaker and it was so difficult for me to understand the recipe. I love this channel.
The dog... on her apron... is talking
Legitimately moving it’s snout
I had to stop a couple of times and check just in case I was actually losing my mind and was just really itching to see her puppy companion
Omg I'm so happy u guys posted again I love these videos so much! I hope u are doing well chef
Love the channel but my heart still drops missing francis.
Thank you for making my favorite dish at Mitsuwa Market here in the U.S. I get it every time and it is just so delicious!
I’ve been a fan of this amazing YT channel for a 1 year ❤️ I still love this channel ❤️
This made my day thank you!!
Thanks everyone!!!! Great job. Now I need some nice bowls and be all set.
So happy to see you chef and to hear you narrator. We miss you Francis - forever in our hearts!
Hurray! I love your videos!
just noticed francis mouth on chef's apron is moving.. lol
Looks amazing as usual, Chef! Keep cooking delicious dishes :)
Ok how long did it take everyone else to realize that the dog on the apron is actually animated to talk. About 4.45 for me 😂
I got really confused when I first saw the title, I couldn't understand how an egg had tendons... Realised my mistake pretty quickly
最後の注釈で うはっ！ と声が出ました。足の上に落とさなかったですか？どうぞお気をつけて😊
天丼美味しそうですねー❤️
Oh my god. Francis is dead.
HER APRON IS FREAKIN ALIVE GUYS.
I definitely want to make this recipe soon!
I miss the old background music
오랫만이에요:) 늘 건강하세요 선생님

What a lovely treat to see your video in my feed today!  And what a mouthwatering recipe!  Many thanks, Chef!
Thank you for another great video!
Hi chef, how are you? I am going to make this tommor.  My cat just passed away two weeks ago.  He had been with us for over 12 years.  😔 seeing Francis's photo, just remind me of the grief that I am still going thru.  Wish you a great weekend ahead.
お元気そうで、何よりです。
料理の勉強になります！
I miss your show but I hope that you will bring a new dog like Francis back trained.
Omg such a long time :D welcome back :D
Am I the only one that cried at the Francis plushie :’( I’ve been watching your show for years and years Francis will always be with you and with us 💜
I miss the dog so much....
その可愛い犬懐かしいね 。。。
:(
This looks so yummy. Thanks for sharing, chef!

I MISSED YOU GUYS :')
Glad to see you back in action . I love your content .
I had this while I was in Akihabara, it's so good
احب هذا البرنامج 💚😀💘
Hi, Chef! May I request for a video on how to make Jelly Fry which is famous in Gyoda in Saitama Prefecture? The videos I have found are in Japanese and I am not sure what are the ingredients for the sauce.
Can you make umeboshi onigiro ?   Thank you.
it's time for a new mascot for this show <3
Chef your warped frying pan is a new design for great tempura frying since yours turned out so pretty!
I MISSED YOU GUYS 😭
We missed you! Please give chef and "francis" our love!
i really like your plants!
Why are you cooking so good??? ❤️❤️❤️
すごく美味しそう!👍👍👍
Will you be getting another dog sometime soon? :)
I laughed way harder than I probably should have when you explained the warped pan lol.
That looks delicious!  You guys are awesome!
Thank you for sharing your love .
im so happy that chef is still cooking with love
癒されます(*´꒳`*)❤︎
This looks Sooo good,but I can't get fresh okra or that kind of squash in Germany. :(   I think this could taste great with zuccini or Hokaido pumpkin though. Just a shame to leave the okra out. I grew up in Louisiana, I LOVE okra and miss it all the time. Thank you as always for a great recipe. ありがとうございます。
we love you <33333333333333333333
When I saw the doll I was confused but I just learned he died I was in the dark about it till today 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
It's so nice to see you and "Francis" again.  I miss you guys very very much!  Hugs.
The music at the end made me tear up. Love u guys...
We luv you, Chef ❤️
おなかが空いたよう、おなかが空いたよう

is the dog a real one? or just a doll?
Even if I have just eaten your videos make me hungry
That looks so good!!!
这英文真的很日式。(˶‾᷄ ⁻̫ ‾᷅˵)
oh my..is it already that long ago ?   I  thought , to miss something here. Or rather someone.Francis sure was a highlight of this cooking show.Without wanting to be disrespectful to the memoirs of Franny...have  you already been on the look out for a new companion to co-host your delicious recipes ?I pray that you will find your new match soon.
Love your videos 💓
7:38 - 7:45 I didn't even notice that the pan was warped! I was so concentrated on the Tempura veggies!
I just moved to Japan, so it's nice that I can find these ingredients easy :)
ひもじい天丼じゃのぉ〜
The dog on the apron moves his lips or mouth 💀
This looks amazing can't wait to make it
Will next be Takoyaki?
nice recipe, look so yummy
7:52 Talking apron!
Francis apron is talking 💗
シェフ、お元気ですか？
So therapeutic...
I feel like I’ve heard this music in Final Fantasy XV...dunno if im crazy for thinking that
Warped Pan 😂
hope you are doing well chef !!!!!
Francis on her apron was talking !!
did anyone notice francis on her apron's mouth is moving with the speaker?
Japanische Gerichte  - die beste Gerichte in der Welt! Danke und viel Erfolg!👍👍
i saw the dog picture moving it's mouth. i'm shocked a little
はい、元気ですはおよびあついです。😥
I miss and love your channel very much 😌❤️🌹👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️🐶
犬がヌイグルミになってる…
Thank you so much ☺️ 🙏 ❤️👍
YESSSSSS
My daughter and I I love your videos.  I am making a presentation which focuses on the science behind cooking.  I would like to us some of your material and reference it in my material.  Will you contact me to discuss permission to use some of your content in my lessons.
I don't even cook but I love your videos
What the f hahaha the dog picture on her t-shirt is talking. I never noticed the talking dog even after following her channel and watching her videos for quite sometime now, until today. That's really creative. Now I understand why this channel is called cooking with dog.
I love you and your dog! I am so happy that you continue to make videos!
初めまして。耳が不自由なので、日本語字幕付きなのは助かります。ありがとうございます。
嬉しくなったので、チェンネル登録させていただきました。料理好きなので、勉強しにまた伺いにきます。
woah! the dog on the apron speaks!
I visited your channel I'm following, I would also appreciate if you support
Missing Francis...
I haven’t watched these videos in forever but seeing the toy Francis kind of broke my heart a little.
Chef please get another Francis.  Please.
I don't cook but it has become my habit to watch people cook. I used to watch this channel 4 years ago and I am happy that you still make videos. I really miss chef and Francis! You're doing great, guys!
❤️ 🥘 W 🐕
I love you Chef!
Man not seeing Francis really hurts...
So happy. Thank you :)
i missed your videos!
Nice to see you!
Yo, I seriously thought Francis was STILL ALIVE UNTIL I saw the comments LOL Francis will always live in my heart anyway. And my husband got creeped out by the Ghost of Francis Apron HAHAHA! He usually doesn't notice these small details but he got cringed to death by it talking. RIP Francis.
:(
うまい！
Dang. I have to go to the neighbourhood Sushi King tonight.
Have you made Kakiage yet
This dish is my favourite
I have to try and get my hands on some okra some time...
awesome job chef!
Maybe everybody already noticed it but I sure did not see it in the previous video the dog in the apron is talking
Anyone noticed that francis on the apron was talking. Haha
I can't understood anything
the dog on her apron is doing the talking xD
Imagine chef getting a new dog at some point and the show will have two hosts
Delicious recipe! 😊👍
It took me until 3:25 to realize that Francis’ mouth on Chef’s apron is animated. That’s amazing. Is this new or have I been missing out?
I'm so happy the dog is dead already. He had suffered enough torture already from years of salivating on the foods cooked on this channel.
さしぶりです
She reminds me of the lady from cooking mama
i see the mouth of francis in chef's apron moves while the voice over is talking, is it for real?
フランシス
Upon eating Chef looks as if she is burning the hell out of her mouth !!!!  Such dedication and good luck with no injuries Chef !!!!  Can't wait for the next episode !!!!!!  Corie in Seattle
How yummy! Fantastic video
Yayyyy! New video!!
wonderful.
OishisOoo
Couldn’t you use cheesecloth instead of a teabag too for the sauce?
カタカナ英語聞きズラいなぁー
yuuum
If anyone has poodles or breeds poodles please consider donating
DROOOOOLING
I don't think it's necessary for the dog's mouth on the apron to try and talk anymore....
1:30 anyone else see Francis on her apron talk??
Lovely tempura
Is that a stuffed toy?
Wow I love Seafood 🦐 🦐 🦐 🦐 🦐 🦐 🦐 🍢🍢🍢🍢🍢🍢🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍙🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱
— omg I just noticed. The Francis on her apron MOVES HIS MOUTH! Omg that’s so cute xD
What happened to the dog??? That's a stuffed animal... 😢😢😢😢 and now her approan talks...  still love them though
2 months ago I lost my best friend, the person who gave me advice in life, and the person  Who has cared for me from majority of my life. I lost my Foster mom my mom to small cell lung carcinoma a very aggressive lung cancer that spreads to other organs in the body. We took her to the ER and by the time we got the diagnosis on the cancer she died less than 24 hours later in 8 days from the day she went into the ER. Every day since then has been an amazing struggle for me. But seeing this although it may seem silly to some people, seeing you go on and smile I'm keep doing something you love even though I'm sure you miss Frances dearly helps me know that I can go on too...  I'm still at the part where I don't understand why this happened, and I don't know how to get through it and how to deal with it. Most days I don't get out of bed for anything but work. I come home from work and I go to bed can I stay in bed until it's time for me to go back to work for another 8 hours. It physically and mentally drains me to be around people that long.   But you've helped me to see it little bit of hope , thank you Francis thank you chef.
hi dog. can i pet you?
I miss the dog, why it become stuff toy?
(￣▽￣)"
THE MOUTH MOVES. I REPEAT. THE MOUTH MOVES. HOW.
AM I TRIPPIN? Or is the dogs mouth on her shirt moving? Whoa
:'(
Yum🍤🍲
Great timing! Tendon Tenya in my country just closed. I miss ebi tendon so much
Shared!
What happened to dog?
Nice one
Where is the cute dog?
Definitely thought it was a unique shaped pan and not because she dropped it! Haha. Also chef, is there such a thing as tempura batter that doesn't use wheat flour?  After finding out I was allergic to wheat, I was so upset knowing I can't have tempura anymore!! Is there a way I can buy or make my own? Please help me be able to enjoy tempura again :((
Wasn
wtf is francis
偶然ですね！！！！私のワンコもフランシスって名前です！！！偶然すぎ！！！！www

ちなみに犬種はビションフリーゼです！
Where is Francis????? And talking apron is creepy... Return everything back!!!
Can she adopt me though
Hi, chef I added the subtitles of Chinese for this Tendon video several days ago and didn't get further information, just wonder what the result is, or it's YouTube to check?
So cute
Onaka tsuita
You make me hungry now hahaha
Francis died  ;(
Why dog not move ?
what´s up with Francis???
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
What happen with francis the dog?? A dog or doll???
Frances i miss you and i love japan one day i will go to japan and i will enjoy the food thier 🤗
So glad you guys are still doing videos!! This is awesome, thank you!!
please never stop making these awesome videos.. you guys are one of the first youtubers i watched and i don't want this channel to dissapear
When the footage of Francis showed up at the beginning I was so confused. I though you guys got another similar dog for the show or something for a second.
at 1:34 You can catch Francis talking on the apron.... Was happy to see a new video!
As an Italian with cooking experience I can say: well done! Normally at home we would not add butter, but it's a trick used in restaurants ;) also if you want the pasta more saucy and savoury, don't boil it for all the minutes written on the package - remove it 3 or 4 minutes earlier and let it finish cooking in the sauce you're making, even adding some spoons of the water it was boiling in to the sauce. The result is totally different since the pasta will bind with the sauce much better :D
I clicked so fast when this popped on my feed haha
So happy to see Francis again! I'm glad the new Francis in the stool has the same voice, lol. I love Francis' voice as well.
The only problem? They are always too short. But I think I could never be happy even if it were an hour long. It's my absolute favourite channel.
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
Can't express how inspiring Chef is by keeping Francis in obvious memory and continuing the channel :'D:'D
Ahh!!! I missed you 😭
Yea!!! Cooking with Dog is back 🐩
you look so well chef 😊
If I buy a Frances apron from your page. Will he commentary my cooking as well and speaking my videos? ... lol.  I notice in some of her videos. The image of Francis on her apron is speaking
I miss the dog already, but i'm SO missing out on exotic culinary meals!
chef looks so energetic and healthy!!! thank you for continuing the channel, i love trying out your recipes ❣️🍝
That octopus is huge! This looks delicious! ♥
Everybody misses Francis...😊I had a very similar dish, only squid and its tentacles were used instead, and a very good olive oil was drizzled. I miss Japan so much😢
美味しそう！たこのパスタいいですねー🍝見ていて無性に食べたくなりました！動画UPありがとうございます😊
I missed you guys so much
Hi Mom lots of love and Hugs ❤❤❤❤❤❤😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love the foods !

I love the bloopers at the end. I always look forward to your videos, thank you for making them!
Super Cute hair Chef! I love the talking dog apron! Soo good to see you!
パスタとタコは美味しそうです。メキシコからこんにちは、あなたの番組とても大好きです。
These videos are such a joy
2:41 I missed the "looks so delicious"
Thank you for coming back Chef
That looks so delicious chef! Its such a pity we can't get octopus easily where I am. I found an online vendor however! i'll have to give you pasta or takoyaki recipe a try!
1:36 APRON DOG STARTED TALKING 😨🧐
I grew up watching cooking with dog. The first video that I remembered watching from your channel was making ebi fry. I am so glad that you still keep making videos, Chef is such a lovely lady to watch and taught me a lot about cooking. Watching Cooking with Dog makes me forget about my stress and anxiety and everything, it is just good food and good people! Hopefully Chef will always be able to enjoy making these videos!!
Wow, awesome. Japanese/Sardinia fusion recipe, maybe? Looks awesome.
Looks delicious chef. Long Life and health for you!
I HAD A HEART ATTACK I THOUGHT FRANCIS WAS BACK DON'T DO THIS TO ME
You make me so happy, honestly. Please never stop cooking and making videos! You’re such a sweet woman, I can’t help but smile when I watch these videos.
I remember in 2011 i used to always watch cooking with dog. I would cook and bake recipes from their videos like every week if not everyday. My favorite was the napolitan spaghetti using pork slices. Mmm best spaghetti i ever made and ate in my entire life. I love spaghetti too btw. Its nice returning to this channel in 2018 for some new recipes and nostalgia. :3 

ありがとうchef 犬さん(*˘︶˘*).｡.:*♡
Mmm exquisito!!
Mil gracias!
Abrazos desde México, Maravilloso, Mágico!!!
Great music choice to match the dish, and thanks for the recipe, Looking forward to more :>

OMG I cant get over how hungry this video made me right now!

That francis doll <3
Thought i was losing my mind when the apron started talking
Wonderful to see you again! It’s like seeing family you haven’t seen in a long time! Love that even though Frances has gone that he is still a huge part of the channel and is included respectfully! Thank you for the video!
i love when the apron talks! thank you so much this recipe looks delicious!!
It makes me so happy seeing chef chuckle at the end ♥
YES. IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
I’ve been watching cooking with the dog forever, literally since I was in middle school and now I’m in college. I adore chef. I hope she’s doing well these days. 💓💓
New video! Yes, thank you!
I was thinkin' "Oh, this sure is an italian like dish" and then.. "Add the soy sauce and butter". Oh. Nope, I was wrong. She never said this was gonna be an italian recipe, but the prep up til then was very traditional ahah
Anyways, Chef you're always amazing <3
Looks delicious! 
(It's Time to update your bio on yt!)
I'm really happy to see you again and I'm glad to see Chef so happy. Her smile is worth all the waiting ❤
FRANCIS!!! There’s just something relaxing about watching cooking with dog even tho most ingredients are not easy to find here 😅 i still keep coming back!
That octopus!!  A gorgeous  pasta dish 😋 Bravi 😍
Good to hear from you again as always, Chef, and thank you for another fun recipe! I hope you're having a good summer!
This is wonderful! I love the talking apron!  Miss you Francis, but your memory will live on!
I saw Francis footage in the intro and for a second I was like, gasp 😱”He has risen!!! Somebody call the Vatican!Francis has risen again!!!!”
This looks amazing!!!! Love octopus. 🤤
THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS!!! (´∀｀*)
Watching this while eating nuggets. 

I'm not very good in this adulting- thing.
I just noticed that Francis on chef's apron MOVES HIS MOUTH. 

I'm shooketh
I missed you so much, you're my comfy healing place on earth!!
Somos sus fans! Muchas gracias por continuar con su increíble trabajo <3
I like your videos the atmosphere so comforting. Never aware of the dog talking in the Rob.
先生かわいい♡
I am proud of you, i love how you treated the spaghetti. Greetings from Sardinia!    <3
Good to see you again, chef! That looks so delicious! 💕
Omg Francis on the cooking apron is talking! <3
That's a great octopus tomato spaghetti recipe. Looks so good
I love your videos! The recipes are amazing!
Miss youuuuuu^^  Looks delicious! :D Thanks for the recipe!^^
I’ll just substitute with prawn, the cheaper alternative! 😜
待ってました！(≧∀≦)
This looks amazing! I would have never put soy sauce in pasta, but who knows, maybe it`s good! I`ll try it!
I love this channel and I love francis, but people missed the perfect opportunity for a Really good joke involving having finally Cooked with Dog. (I am aware of how morbid this is, it's called dark humor)
Thank you for another wonderful video!
I love this channel! It was one of the first I subscribed to ♡ so happy that you still make videos. This dish looks absolutely delicious too!
It took me so long to realize the apron Francis was talking.
I really enjoyed watching Chef smile and laugh. Wonderful! :)
The francis drawing on her apron was talking😮😰
I miss you sooo much! glad you guys still making videos. best of luck to you all :3 good luck in the kitchen
This looks delicious! Pretty easy recipe too, I really want to try it. <3
Delicious! 😋 Thanks for the video!!
So happy ...you are back. I miss you so much
とっても、おいしそうです！
I absolutely felt like crying when I watched this video... I’ve watched her Videos for 6 years. I really love this lady. She is really cute. Much much love from Iraq 🇮🇶 ❣
Thank you for your videos! They're really helpful and I've enjoyed lots of savoury Japanese dishes thanks to your recipe. Can you made a video for making Shoronpo/ 小籠包? It's one of the best dishes I've ever had in Japan but there aren't much Japanese recipe about it on youtube. Thank you!
Omg octopus i dont like the
Tomato
Troll
Aww when apron Francis talks it's so cute!
いつも美味しいレシピを教えていただいてありがとうございます。
hello very nice cooking☺🍺🍺🍺🍀🍀🍀💕💕💕
As an italian pasta lover, I must say: this dish looks extremely delicious, I can almost smell the octopus and the sauce! I love it!
I'm totally going to make this.  (I live in Hokkaido)
I think I need a better  knife for this , mine struggles to cut through tough parts chicken breast lol!
Looks delicious! Thanks for sharing (:
Just realized Francis is speaking on your garment!
:"( Francis is now replaced by a stuffed toy hhuhuhu
I love octopus, it is really appreciated here in Spain. We prepare it with olive oil, red pepper (hot or not) and salt.... soooooo good :D
If you slightly undercook the spaghetti, you can finish cooking it in the sauce. That will help absorb extra water, and also help the sauce cling to the noodles. Looks great! And healthy!
I really hate the octopus sucker looks but u make it looks so good now 😂😍
First time to try out your recipe. It was superb. I also added some additional ingredients with it. A few herbs will do especially the Basil.

Oishii~ (^3^)
Now I'm craving for pasta and it's 3am in the morning here... have to cook pasta tmr!😅
please don't stop making videos, you are the best cooking channel i've ever watched
yay new video again thanks
I've never seen such a big piece of octopus!
It looks delicious QpQ
That intro with Francis threw me off, I almost thought I was watching a video from a year or two back!
what is the dog's name. glad watching you again
Glad to see you doing well and still doing videos Chef!
Can I replace octopus with squid?
In korea squid is easy to available.

1.35 HER APRON IS TALKING
00:36 - 00:56 am I crazy or is the Francis apron character moving it’s mouth ...I used to love watching this channel ...just returned to it after seeing the fruit sandwich vid again #RIPFrancisthedog ☹️ I just found out too
So nice to see new video, I miss u guys 😀
My heart skipped a beat when I saw Francis in the beginning of the video. Then realized it was an old cut; of course, silly me! You're probably one of the very first channels that I subscribed to years and years ago. :) I learned so many of the classic Japanese dishes from you!
Please don't ever leave. 
Find Francis II
3:21 WHAT THE DOG ON HER APRON IS TALKING ::'''D
I'm eagerly waiting for a new video to come, but in vain for the last 1.5 months. Is everything alright ? 😢
HER APRON TALKS!!!
Great video, for a second i thought Francis were back, i was prepared for the toy to move.
The way she eats makes it seem like the food is always nasty, but I know it's likely not. I think she just doesn't really like eating.
I’ve always wanted to try octopus
Thank you for the video.
For a sec I thought why That doggy is not moving? Then I saw a video of Francis.☹️😩😢
FRANCIS IS STILL DEAD.... 😭
ANYBODY REALIZE THAT DOG PRINT ON THE APRON IS ACTUALLY NARRATING?? LIKE BEING ANIMATED SOMETIMES!?!? WOAAAH🤯🤯😳😳
Look at her apron
love you guys! makes me hungry as always!
oh my god it’s a plushy francis
I really want to see Francis😹😻💜
Would definitely make this
What brand of soy sauce do you use? It looks much thicker than the brands available where I live.
Can you guys please make a hoodie with Francis on the front??😭😭😭
ぬいぐるみ、フランシスかと思ったw
簡単だし美味しそう〜😍😍👍🏻
Francis, Jr...You're also such a sweet & perfect, little "still" gentleman...HaHaHa...I  want to give you a big kiss & a cookie & THEN eat...  : )
you look more enjoy cooking than start,
GLAD TO SEE YOU COOK AGAIN AAAH😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
美味そう!!! 😍
This looks absolutely mouthwatering!! I can't wait to try making this!
よくみたらエプロンの犬がしゃべっていていることに気づいた（笑）
I am happy you are back oishii ✌️😀
うわぁ😍美味しそう！
This looks great!  Now, if I can only find some octopus....  ;-)   Thanks Chef.  Always love your videos.
外国の人ってタコ食べるようになったのかな、デビルフィッシュとかいって嫌ってたような・・・。
I LOVE cooking with dog!
Este es el canal que más amo
Takoyaki pasta <3
The music😂
ナレーションのお兄さんの感情を込める部分がたまらなく良いです！んんんーーってとこ。
シェフのNGシーンも可愛い！
I don't think I can get octopus, but I might try this with some squid...mhm, looks delicious.
タコとトマトのパスタなんて初めて見ました！
とても美味しそうです〜今度やってみます！
他のレシピ楽しみにします
A long time , i haven't seen you . Wish you alway have good health and happy !
i miss you and francis too.
This channel make me want to cook.
Hey Chef! Is that a cuddle clone of Francis?!
Wow, giant octopus arm! Looks tasty chef
本当に美味しいそうね!
I miss u guys!!
Francis died and his ghost is possessing the apron.
I like how they made the  print  of Francis look like he's talking
Yeay for new videos!!! Keep it up!
I just finished the final bite and it was sooo delicious! Thank you for this amazing recipe.
wait, starting at 3:17 francis's mouth on the shirt is mouthing the words i hear O.O
I miss Francis so much.
Delicious! I will try this recipe :D
お帰りなさい！相変わらず美味しそうなレシピです！
The APRON TALKS

Ohisashiburidesu🎶

The apron!! :O
MMMMmm, that looks so delicious. Thanks for yet another great video.
Francis talks on the apron!!! xD
Oishikatta!
Chef is so sweet. ♥
https://bit.ly/2S9Tzd7?-fattt-lossss-diet-and-workoutttt
Wow the word I want to say is the tako is big
おっ！まってましたぁ！♪
Chef is so cute <3 I love her
I like button 😘💕
Chef's laughter is to good for this world!
I thought I had waaaaay to many drinks when I saw Dog talking on the apron at the beginning.  Thank god I'm not insane.
WHAT??!! This is not Dog!
Don't mix seafood and cheese. Seafood and cheese don't match together.
i love your cooks
Chef is so adorable.
Maybe it's time to get a new dog?
0:52 Francis's mouth is moving. :D
@0:53 francis is speaking on her apron O___O
Francis :(
❤️
Welcome back.
octopus are intelligent creatures, you shouldnt eat them
4.5年前程前に、見ていた者です！
当時はスマホを持っておらず、3DSで拝見させていただいておりましたが、スマホを手に入れ久しぶりに見に来たら、相変わらずお元気そうで安心しました☺️
これからも楽しみにしています！
チャンネルを見つけられて良かったです！
Is that a toy dog??😂
I would like to see how you can teach people to cook with tofu if any recipes I find it hard to work with.
Looks super nice. Can't really find fresh octopus where I stay. Maybe I will try with prawns!
美味しそうですー！私が住んでるところではなかなかタコ見つからず。海老で作ってみようかな？見た目もキレイで、最高のレシピですねー！シェフ！(^^)
RIP Francis
Can’t wait to try this out
Looks delicious!
Did anyone notice that the dog on her apron speaking? Lol
You are back
That looks soo tasty!
Yummy!!!
Francis and gang should make cooking  a video with Boogie2988
i love chef!
this looks so delicious.  I was wondering if it might be possible to substitute something like squid for the meat?  Is the taste/consistency similar enough?
I've been watching these videos for ever since the first of them came out. I unfortunately haven't had time to try new recipes out for awhile and coming back now to see Francis gone hurts me greatly, as my 13 years old dog died this year. Worst pain I've gone through in my entire life and so fresh in my mind that watching this video brought me to tears.

Still, great to see you're still making content. I will be trying this one out soon.
bonjour et merci
YOU LIKE BUTTON!!!
Looks delicious!
Took me a minute to realize the apron was talking lol.

Francis resurrection
1:35 anyone noticed the dog on the apron talking.
This looks sooooo goooood
💚💚💚
I have a poodle too but mines ugly😢😢😢😢😢💔💔💔💔💔🐩
I thought I was tripping at 1:35
Oh new dog
Thanks
私はいつも良いパスタ料理とタコを含むものを探しています！シェフ、ありがとう！
Hey, that's looks so delicious👌......I've got to make this. 😃
Were is francis?, what happen?
Interesting
talking apron dog wtf so high
Looks so yummy!! Thanks for sharing. Thumbs up!!!Great video! 🙋 👍 😀 😍 😘 🌺 🌻
I want to eat this
Hi. How can I cook Octopus to make the consistency Soft?
Y did ur dog die??? I never knew😱😱😱😱😱😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
ໝານອ້ຍໃນຜ້າກັນເປືອ້ນເວົາ ້ໄດ້
Very nice 👌👍
美味しそう！わたしはこのパスタを作って見る。でも、バターが好きじゃなかったら、使わないもいい？
This looks delicious! I’m gonna try making it. 😊 But can I omit the butter?
Sorry but I haven't watched this channel for sometime...what happened to Francis?
Chef I issued you so much!  Please never stop!  You’ve helped me learn to make Japanese food at home and my child lives it- she lives watching too!
Awesome videos ,like allways
Love love this! Made me salivate despite feeling bad for octopus (really love that animal).

Would still eat.
Why did Francis die
That was all perfect, then came the parmesan with fish... My Italian heart cries T_T.
But I still love you two <3
💙
Everything flawless untill they added parmesan... No cheese on seafood, thank you
Thank you for making videos! I appreciate the effort to keep with the theme, but the animated dog talking apron is actually really distracting and I'd rather you just left it out. That's just my two cents though. Please continue the good work!
It startled me when chef's apron started talking.
When I saw the intro, for one moment, I thought Francis was still here w us
Third (first)
It’s been 11 years and still the voice over man’s English is great
I thought that Francis came back, but I forgot about that. Still, I'm glad you guys are back.
You should get a new puppy
How is doggie
I work as a volunteer at an aquarium where I live, and I know that when people eat seafood, they either get them that're farm raised or wild caught. Which of these do you prefer to use when cooking dishes with seafood in it?
Am I going crazy or does the dog on the apron move its mouth??? 😯
I think we need to stop commenting about Francis' passing so much. We shouldn't forget Francis, but we also shouldn't make his passing the main subject of every video. Commenting about his death on every video is not helping anyone. I believe Francis is still present and alive through Chef's cooking, so we don't need to continuously remind everyone that he's no longer physically here. I think Chef would like to remember Francis through her cooking more, not through the continuous plague of comments about his death all the time. Let's just be more positive, and appreciate Chef's determination to keep working hard and making videos despite her loss of Francis.
Hey guys! We are sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.🙏 This recipe is similar to Tsukemen🍜 (ramen noodles served with hot dipping broth). We used fresh soba noodles but you can also cook dried soba. The dipping broth is exceptionally delicious so we hope you enjoy this refreshing noodle dish this summer.😋 Good luck in the kitchen❣️
I cant believe the apron is talking
i love this show
i'll miss francis </3
I like that they didn't try to replace Francis with a new dog
Wow the dog's mouth on the apron can move
Thank you Chef. Please keep making videos
Seeing chef smile brightens my whole day. Cooking with Dog is my favorite channel on YouTube and has gotten me through some very sad times. Thank you for continuing to make videos and sharing awesome food!
Chef is looking very sweet today! This is an amazing recipe, and if I hadn't already started making karaage, I would make this for tonight.  Excellent recipe!
If you look, Francis on her apron talks!  So cute!

In Japan, we also keep some of the hot water used to cook the soba noodles as "soba yuu".  You can dump some into regular soba dipping sauce to make a soup or thin out the broth with it.
Yay!! New video!
We miss you chef!
Hope you guys are well! Another great video, thank you ❤️
I love all your recipes. Missed you so much. Thank you!
I've been seeing a lot of tsukemen lately and then suddenly you posted a recipe!! I want to try it ^-^
I love how you say onion! I could watch these videos all day!
Look so good!!! Yummy! Havnt tried dipping soba before. Will try this out!
Love your kitchen set up and that talking apron!
Happy to see a new video! Hope you’re doing well!
So much passion. I watched one of your videos 8 years ago and now today you're still here cooking the best. You're amazing and an inspiration.
Excellent, I am glad you are still doing well. I love the plushies and the apron!
😍🤩💖ALL of my love all the way from the U.K.
I've had this in Tokyo and it was amazing! We added raw beaten egg to the broth as well.
I just noticed the duck chopstick holder in 6:17. So cute!
This looks so yummy~ I wanna try😍
I swear chef is the real life cooking mama and I love it 🍥
おいしそー！

エプロンの犬が喋っててかわいい…！
Love these videos because it gives me ideas for authentic Japanese cooking that I otherwise wouldn't know about here in Australia. Most places here just make Sushi and if your really lucky, dumpling stew. Would love to see more dishes like this here.
This made my evening happier! Thank you chef :)
Ahhh, I just realised that the Apron talks xP
Thank you for posting this video. I'm so sorry for your loss!
The picture of Francis in in the background<3
Awesome 👏 とっても美味しそう！動画更新すごく嬉しいです😃
Chef, each of your videos is like a treat to me! More videos please!! Love you!
Very very helpful thank you very much I appreciate it thank you
Missed you and your videos! Thank you for this recipe! ❤
I first watched this when I was 3! I’m ten now and this channel was always the same! Love the recipes and dog!
Watching you cooked made me happy. Kind of took my stress away from work. Ganbatte Chef! Please continue sharing your amazing videos. :)
So good to hear from you as always, Chef, and thank you for another wonderful recipe! I hope you're doing well! :D

It is wonderful to see Chef cooking again,  thank you for the delicious recipe idea
Thank you so much for making videos!!! im going to make this when i move in with my s/o, so we can both enjoy these delicious recipes!!!
Welcome back we missed you and Francis spirit.
I'm so glad you've continued making videos. I've been watching from the very beginning. I use your videos frequently as reference whenever I miss Japanese food.
Happy to see you back Chef!  Looks delicious!  Now I am hungry!  (^_^)
Wow this looks delicious!  Thanks for another great video!
I love it! ^_^ Your videos always makes me smile, and feel hungry =P
My favorite cooking channel! 😇
It's really a shame I can't enjoy a lot of these recipes, I'm unfortunately severely allergic to the sugars found in mushrooms, even a little bit of liquid that previously had mushroom in it causes nausea. Luckily it doesn't affect all fungus so I can still eat brie, truffles, yeast and miso.
Looks delicious chef! Thanks for the video!
yay! Love your videos so much <3
Aww Francis will live forever with these recipes
good to see new video
I love this show with all my heart!♡♡♡
I'm so happy that she looks so well😊
I was worried after she disappeared 😥 but crisis averted ☺️
Is it just me or is the Talking apron Adorable? Lololo 😘😘
Can't believe the cook looks just like 10 years ago...
What do they put in your water?
I love noodles. I think I'll try to make this next <3
Super delicious, chef! Keep making videos and thank you so much!
Is it Soba season? I see so much soba recipes, so hungry
Chef, how do you get more adorable with each new video?? 💖
I always look forward to your videos, they are so great 😁
This looks so delicious 😆
The recipe is great and the music too!!!
May I know what kind of Soba did you use here? Ichibanko, Nibanko, Sanbanko? Is it Nibanko?
I like everything! From Manila
Where can I buy metal disk that keep from boiling over?
Thumbs up from me for the talking apron! Love your videos
This dish looks heavenly, something I will definitely have to try someday. Thank you, Chef!
美味しそうです～ このチャンネル本当に最高！これからも応援してます(＾▽＾)❣
Yaye, are you back with regular videos!? This looks soooo delicious, that I want some NOW!!! <3
Duck meat is a popular meat in the winter time here in Germany. As soon as it is season and duck is available everywhere I will try it with a duck thigh - or would you recommend a different cut of duck, Chef? Thank you and greetings from Germany
動画待ってました！☆°.*・。
エプロンのフランシス、口パクパクさせてかわいい∩^ω^∩
Omg this looks so good! I'm trying it out for sure.
Those magic words at the end - "coming soon". I'm always happy to see a new video from Cooking With Dog. :)
Also where in Ohio do I find these ingredients!?!
Can I use duckbrest instead of chicken?
Lots of love from the Philippines! Keep it up!
new videos always make me so happy !! love u, chef !
This is my first CoD video after Francis went to where all good boys go and im a mess.
I missed this sooo much
Welcome back chef! ❤

美味しそう〜😍😍😍私は冷たいお蕎麦を温かいつゆにつけて食べるの大好きです❤️
Haha the apron is so cute! It’s like Francis is talking 💕
Looks amazing chef!!
Finally, welcome back 😘
I'm still upset that Francis is gone...sorry but anyways lovely video
That broth looks fantastic! I will try to make this, but I think I'll need something that can replace dashi stock. Ideas?
FINALLY food looks great!
omg. i thought i was going crazy for a little bit, but francis's mouth on the apron did move!!!! :O i'm NOT crazy....in this very specific scenario
I love Soba Noodles so much! Looks like a fun recipe!
I spot 10 francis 🐩💕
I just noticed Francis in the apron TALKS!

Thank you so much for the new video. These noodles look delicious! 👍😊😊
I'm so happy to see Chef again. Sending all the love and good vibes. Can't wait to try this out.
Oh my gosh, I just realized they animated the pup on her apron! SO CUTE
What may be substitute for sake? (No alcohol please)
Great channel!
I miss francis though :(
As always big thanks! This is what I will cook today for my japanese family :)
francis is gone but yet. get a new one maybe?
Great recipe!
Chef! We missed you so much! ;-;
It's a shame that this channel will forever be cursed by Francis's death. The videos are still just as enjoyable though.
Chef, will you adopt me?
I was thinking about this channel all this past week because I hadn’t seen a video in a while. Now I’m a little saddened about Francis. So much love for ya’ll ❤️
Thank you for uploading. Cooking with dog is really my favorite channel on YouTube. I have tried some of the recipes and very delicious. Definitely will try this one! 😍😋
Francis' best friend come to join the party now? The more, the merrier~  They look so snazzy with their mini fedoras and ties! Hehe, everybody wants some of Chef's food! I've gotta try this too) And the preview dish looks so delicious! Perfect for a veggie/cheese freak like me! Thank you for these! 😆🍷
This looks so good. I'm hungry now!
Sth I could actually cook for once. I just need to order some soba.
That apron apron had me freakin' out for a minute
i just notice francis on apron speak!
Hi Chef! You look well!
Stay healthy chef~ 🤗
Hahaha! I just noticed the dog on the shirt talking! So cute!!! LOL
Yay! 45th viewer
凄く得意です！
I am beyond happy they didn’t replace Francis although I will miss him as I’m sure we all will. I love these videos and always learn so much from them.
これから暑くなる夏はこれできまりですね。☆
It's cool that the dog on the apron is talking. Francis will forever be missed.
Dog ????
So if the Noodles are all buckwheat and tamari is substituted for soy sauce I could eat this. It sounds really good.
フランシスがいないと、なんだか映えませんね。寂しいです…お料理はもちろん上手で美味しそうだけれど、心無しかお母さんの笑顔にも寂しさがちょっぴり零れてしまっているように見えてしまいます…
<3 <3 <3
Chef knocks it out of the park again! She looks as though she really enjoyed the soba! :)
This looks amazing!
3:51 oh the dog in the apron is talking...too focused on what she’s cooking!
I missed you 🤗
Slurp and enjoy! どうもありがとうございました
We will have this dish on weekend.
Hola!
Que tal!
Gusto en saludarte!
Mmm exquisito!!
A mi hijo le fascina!!
Abrazos desde la Cdmx!!!
Hi Chef!  This looks so delicious! I just bought some soba noodles last weekend and I will try this recipe.
My God.  I just realized that this lovely woman looks EXACTLY like my mom... if she were Japanese rather than American... and if she wore plaid... and a poodle apron.
Yayyyyyy very awesome concept 👏
Good to see Chef is in good spirit =)
So wonderful to have you back!
Francis's mouth moves, how cute!
so happy to see your videos!!! <3 lots of love!!
You are the best

❤🐾
昔日本に住んでいたころ、スーパーで鴨肉が半額になっているのを見つけては買って、家で鴨せいろを作っていました。逆に鶏バージョンは食べたことがないんですが、おいしそうで今度試してみたいと思います。
Greetings from Mexico
My mouth is watering, it looks super delicious!
I miss Francis :(
Ive missed these videos! So nostalgic.
つけ蕎麦👍
no matter how long we wait, I still love these videos! it doesn't matter if I don't like it or never make it. I will never not like one of your videos.
Amazing channel!
アップロードありがとうございます✨ とても美味しそうです💝
Welcome back😋🍜
Did that Apron just bark at the camera.. e.e I'm sure I sure the mouth move..
❤️❤️❤️❤️😀
If I don't have dashi stock on my place, what is replacement to that?
Wow!! Looks so yummy!! Love youuuuuuuuuu^^
Vegetarian ramen recipe?
It would be so cool if cooking with dog and cooking with lion did an episode together
Lol I like the dog on chef apron lol his mouth is moving
I'm getting cooking with dog merch soon
Yep. Watching this late at night in bed is a bad idea. Hahhaa!
just noticed Francis on her apron is talking!
I love your channel!!!
Amazing!!! 🐶😍
Dude, she hasent aged at all...
6:41 She's so cute :D <3

Dear God this looks so delicious!
הכלב עדיין חיי.
Good to see you !!!
We love you Francis
Hello
The stuffed Francis 💜💜💜💜💜💜😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wait, she had the dog stuffed?
This looks amazing! Is there a way I can substitute the alcohol with something non-alcoholic? I would love to make this for my family :'D
She's my cooking mama irl
心配してました！
フランシスもエプロンにだけど、いて嬉しい😊
やっぱりこの2人じゃないと✨
動画いつも楽しみにしてますよ、無理しない程度に頑張ってください♪
Ehuehuehue
My childhood. I always watched your videos when i 10 and under. I love your videos.
talking apron
Delicious
I love your videos.
Yummmmyyy
I always forget how relaxing your videos are. I am curious- sake is expensive here, so would Shaoxing wine be a good substitute?
What is the pan chef uses to cook the chicken? I really like it!
Espanis. Receta.
So cute the little dogs 🐶😍😍
This recipe looks so easy and delicious! I still have Dashi stock in my fridge. Hope I have soba lol
Who is that other dog?
毎回丁寧に調理されていて、尊敬します(^-^)
今日のお蕎麦もとても美味しそう！
子供たち、お蕎麦が大好きなので作ってみますね(^-^)

リクエストなのですが、夏休みが近づいて来ましたので、子供と作れるお菓子や子供が喜ぶようなメニューを教えていただきたいです*ˊᵕˋ*
What is the song at 6:15 in the end of this vdo , i really love this
This looks delicious. I’m thawing some frozen chicken thighs right now for teriyaki tomorrow but I might need to try this.
Where is dog?🐕🤔
Nice to see the new video . シェフの元気の姿が見えることは何より。がんばってね。
Francis was such a good dog but maybe a new dog could fill in his role? Don't get me wrong, no one can be Francis but maybe it could be cooking with dog again instead of just cooking.
what can i use to substitute mirin and sake? Vodka?
It looks yummy!
I'm making cold soba in the summer for the first time, so this is  another use for my soba! Too much soba in my house!
Who is the other dog? (Gasp!) Did Francis get bitchs alot?!
oh that looks so good, wheres the Dog?
where is Francies ?????
え！お犬さんは？
美味しそうですねー。シェフのニコニコ笑顔で余計美味しく見えます。お元気そうで良かったです。暑くなってきましたのでお体にお疲れの出ませんように。また次回も楽しみにしています。
It is working on my iphone
I don’t have Dashi pack I only have bonito flakes and Kombu how can I make it
Did anyone else notice that the dog on her apron is moving it’s mouth
Super 👍🏻🍲❗️❗️💖🌸
Where is the dog🙁🙁.....sorry the last time I watch this channel I was like 9 or 8 yrs old now Im 12
can i substitute with normal spring onion if i cant find it in my country?
For the chicken, does it matter if you use white meat or dark meat?
Hi, where can I get a daishi pack? Do you have any recommendation about brands? I will be visiting Japan soon and would like to buy daishi packs. Thanks!
It has been years and i still miss francis!!!!😭😭😭
Awww, the apron is a great idea! (R.I.P. Francis.😞)
This looks so good. We got chicken out for tomorrow, so I'll suggest this!😂 Thanks for sharing, Chef!💜
where is the cute dog？？？
Someone is watching shokugeki no soma ;D
Japanese misunderstand Chinese food
I'm still crying inside 😞 but when everyones happy, I'm happy.Francis is watching us from above. 
#lovetodoggo 🙏💛
I didn't notice the poodle on her apron "talks" at the same time as the voice-over <3 <3 <3
where u.dog now
Have you ever thought about having a new dog again?
Was it just me or was the dog on her apron moving its mouth
Wtf? Is her apron narrating?
I Hope My Comment Going To Be Seen At 2035
What happened to the dog
I miss frances to much i love you please dont go along time
Where is the poodle?
I've edited videos, and I know that animating the dog's mouth on the chef's apron takes time. I would rather this channel didn't waste time animating the apron but used that time instead to make videos more often like it used to. A month between videos is just too long a wait. Can you please use your time more efficiently? I know given the option of more frequent videos versus an animated apron all your viewers would prefer videos more often.
Where the dog!?
We miss you chef
It always warms my heart to see Chef in a new video ♥️
You're such a sweet, strong woman. I love seeing that you are still smiling, and still yourself. You are so much fun to watch and I get so inspired watching your videos. Keep up the good work!! 💙💙☀️☀️
This channel got me through a very depressing pregnancy due to illness, a long time ago. I watch it with my daughter now. We love you!
welcome back chef! very elegant performance as always <3
Francis we miss you, and Chef you are the best
I miss you doing your bi-weekly videos, but I do understand your probably still sad. Anyways I always get excited Everytime you come out with your new video. I love and miss you and Francis you two will always be in my heart
I miss Francis the dog..may he continue to Rest In Doggy Heaven
I'm so glad you continued on with the channel! <3 We love you guys!! ::HUG:: :) <3
I legit cried 😭 btw I love how you animated him! Too cute!
it looks great! Compliments to the chef.
D e l i c i o s o!!!!!
Saludos desde México Maravilloso!!
me and my mom used to watch cooking with dog together and she would gush over how sweet and good francis is. We love you chef, we know Francis is cooking delicious meals with you in spirit <3 thank you for the memories and delicious food! we still make your mochi recipe :)
here is a really useful tip for you guys. That sweet bean sauce is very very similar to hoisin sauce. ( So much so, because hoisin sauce is much more well known to western audience, I've seen the sweet bean sauce being labeled as hoisin sauce in english while the chinese label clearly states differently).
Therefore, you can basically buy a hoisin sauce and it should do fine.
yum, another tasty looking recipe from chef and francis.  and chef is looking terrific this fine spring day!  thanks.
Welcome back. You always cook such tasty treats. 🤤
Every time you upload a new video it adds 5 years to my life!
Love your vids! Thank you for all your hard work. We all miss you.
Chef! I missed you so much! I’m so glad you made another video! We all miss Francis too but your wonderful cooking skills and the narrator do such a wonderful job! And OMG I only noticed that the doll on chef’s apron sometimes “talks” and opens and closes it’s little mouth! That so cute!!!
You should get a new poodle and name him Francis junior 
It’s like-hey I’m Francis Jr the host of this show cookingwithdog
I love all of your videos! Thank you for doing these! You make my day every time you post!!
This looks wonderful! I''ll certainly make a big mix of it so I have plenty of leftovers for afterward.
That drawing with Chef and Francis just gives the feels. Francis is a good doggo.
It´s great to see chef laughing again :) Keep up the good work <3
I couldn't click fast enough! Thank you Chef for continuing to do these videos, no matter how infrequently. We just love you so much. I'm actually almost crying because it's over and the wait begins again. But the good news is there are so many to watch over and over until you return.
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
Welcome back!
You are one of the best.  Your recipe and cooking are real.
Thank you Chef, simple and easy to follow.
OMG It looks so good!!! But if you do not remove pork oil it's more delicious! Anyway thank you and I'm always watching your video👍👍
I hope you're doing well Chef. It looks delicious as usual. Thank you for sharing. :)
I always love ❤️ your videos. Can't wait to try this recipe.
I'Ve waited so long for a new Video ..Thx alot and lovely greetings from germany
I love this channel so much. It helped me so much 4 years ago during pretty much the hardest year of my life. I will continue to support it for as long as it exists, thank you Chef 🌹💗

Welcome back🤗So glad that you continuing the cook channel...sending you love 💕 and support💪🏻💪🏻
I love you've posted a new video! So tasty :3 thanks a lot
This looks great!! Ever since my gastric surgery, I can only handle whole grain wheat and brown rice if I want any starches (It’s worth it though, down 60 lbs in 4 months!), so seeing how you cook and flavor vegetables really helps me to cook better!! Thank you for showing how to make such good food! Lots of love from America!! 💖💕💖💕
Thanks for a great job.
We miss you.
Started watching this channel since i'm in university. Watching you cooking really help me go through my depressive life as a student. I literally watch your videos everyday for 5 years. Now, it has been 2 years since I'm officially become a doctor, and still watch your videos. Tried a few of your recipes and like it so much. Pls continue posting up recipes, we really miss you chef.
Very good!
Many greetings! from Argentina (South America)

It's great for the Chinese and Chinese-Filipino cuisines was all the restaurants was held at Chinatown in Manila's Binondo District here in the Philippines and set to enjoy your meal with us.
この調理の仕方だと楽なので、今度試したいな。
Chef, we are so blessed that you continue Cooking with Francis! It cold make me cry with joy every time I see you upload again. <3 Thank you. It looks delicious as always. I like the educational information that Francis gives us, like about the different kinds of seasonal cabbage and Japanese versus foreign bell peppers.
Another wonderful recipe! 

Thank you for continuing to make videos for this channel.

Thank you for the new recipe chef!
Welcome back. Oishi food videos ❤️😎📸
I love finishing stuff with sesame oil. Gives it such a nice flavor, plus when the aroma hits the air it's a nonverbal cue to everyone else that dinner is almost ready!
Looking delicious! Thank you Chef! Love you!
Amazing can't wait to try this 
We miss you
Mmmm. So delicious.
Yay!!!
:-D yay you're back!
The talking Francis on the apron is hella impressive! Lovely to see a new video, will try the recipe :D
Great to know you’re back chef! :)
Thank for this recipe, chef. This channel is what got me into cooking ❤
I'm always very happy when I see Chef upload a new video :D
Hope u are doing well chef, love u! 😘
Haha....the music reminds me of Cooking Mama ^o^
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one please. I'm a long time subscriber of your vids. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲
I made this today, it was delicious! I'm definitely making it spicier next time :) Thank you so much for this recipe.
I love your videos chef 😊
I miss Francis. Every Friday I looked forward to a new video.
I understand why they never cast a new dog of exactly the same breed as Francis. Francis is Francis, a one-of-a-kind dog. Hes sorely missed ❤
Can you please do a tenshindon recipe next? It's one of my favorite lunch :)
I haven't watched since Francis passed, I am so happy he's still here in spirit!
I miss Francis :( I can't get over not seeing him standing beside the Chef
LMAO Chef's apron has Francis.. aand it talks.. I saw the mouth move
omg... the Francis on chef's apron is alive!
Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe doggy you got a subscriber!!😇💝
Thank you for the new video, it looks delicious as always ❤
Wow! That looked so delicious and Chef always makes it look so simple and clean. She always makes her dishes so elegantly :) we all love seeing new videos! I hope we get more in the future❤️
We've missed you, welcome back!
I  always wanna know what to do with those thin pork belly slices. This looks perfect.
Excellent and colorful video with the always vibrant chef! Welcome back! I hope you enjoyed your hike
Looks delicious~~ <3
Omg! Its been years since i watch your videos again, im really shocked and sad right now, i just knew that your dog was gone. 😭
I LOVE THE NEW MUSIC!!! Delicious looking as always chef ❤️

Looks so good chef ! How do you keep your pans new and in good condition ?
Ooh, looks delicious. Thank you for sharing, Chef.
Chef is so cute! I’m so glad that you guys still incorporate Francis in your videos, I’ve been subscribed to this channel since I was 11, I’m 18 now. It warms my heart to see that this channel is still going strong. ❤️❤️❤️
It's so good to see you again :)
It looks so delicious. We miss you Francis ❤️🙏🏼
Yei, glad to see you
here "spring cabbage" = regular green cabbage
Great movie! Up here at Y&S FOOD! we really like to notice this style of content. We create Travel & Food films too, around the world, and also we are habitually seeking out inspirations and creative concepts. Thank You.
On chef's apron, Francis' mouth is moving!!!
I thought you weren’t gonna upload anymore 😢

Welcome back Chef we all missed you
Made this for dinner tonight. It was soooo delicious! Thanks for another great recipe <3
glad to see the chef continuing making the videos. miss francis though.
Francis keeps making material even after dying.

He's the Tupac of dogs.
Hello Chef and Francis, I finally bought a rice cooker! Would you make a recipe for a one-pot dish using the rice cooker as a main tool? Thank you very much! Love your videos as always.
@4:50 0___0 Apron Francis talked.
This is a beautiful looking dish, by the way. I love the colors.
I always wanted to make this!
This show is getting creepy...  The Japanese woman is lovely, but she needs to retire.  We all do, sooner or later.
I just noticed that Francis on her apron talks :D
Great Job, love this dish so much for some reason.
I love how simple these recipes are to do... and easily adjusted to a keto diet too!
回鍋肉か、美味そうです！英語の説明している方はインドの人かな？
Thought I was seeing things when the apron started talking. lol
Chef, can you make a video on how to make furofuki daikon? It seems like a simple dish, but looks really delicious.
Did anyone notice that Francis on her apron is talking? O_O
Been a fan for 10 years now . I love you Chef
love your recipes please do kare pan!!!
回鍋肉なかなか決まらなかったので、ビデオ嬉しいです！手順をこの通りにやってみます。ありがとうございます😊
I noticed that the francis print on the apron speaks!!! 😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨😘😘😘😘 so cute
Looks super tasty Chef! Thank you very much for the wonderful video, it made me hungry :)
Does anyone know what type of burner the chef uses on this show?
im happy to see you again chef regards from philippines :)
フィリピン人からもう一度シェフを見て嬉しいです:) translate only
FRANCIIIS I MISS YOUUUUU X(
すごく久しぶりな気がします
お元気にされてるようで安心しました。
今回も美味しそう\❤︎/
When I realized the dog on the apron was talking I knew I had to subscribe.
I love this show 😁
thank you chef, you're a great cook and a wonderful host! can't wait to watch more videos!
okay who disliked this video?
I like to think of Francis hosting a show in heaven—Cooking with God.
Always smile face when cooking!
I found this show about 2 hours ago and fell in love, but I was NOT prepared to find out Francis passed away. Bawling my eyes out.
welcome back
thank you chef and francis!
回锅肉~
Now i'm super hungry
What a beautiful recipe!
Yummmm, great job chef
UGHHH IT MAKES ME SO SAD TO SEE A PICTURE IN PLACE OF FRANCIS
i thought francis was talking through the apron for a moment there...
We love your videos! Stay strong
待ってました！！
🇸🇬👍
😊
Can I use gochujang for the red bean paste.
FRANCIS-KUN !
Oh my goodness, Francis is animated on her apron!!! 😄😄😄
Love you guys.  I went out and got the ingredients for this today. :)
おいしそう~
アリガトウございます
OMG THEY’RE BACK!!!! 😍
エプロンのフランシス、口動いてる？？

oishi sou :o
MAXIMO
I miss you Francis!
A talking Francis Apron! <3 <3 <3
Why francis not in this video 😢
I am happy thanks to you
お帰りなさい！
What are you cooking on? Im thinking of getting a donabe pot and i cant find any portable ones like that for indoors.
@ 0:33 to 0:38 Francis was not "speaking".
I always watch cooking with dog when i was a kid
Miss the little guy. Glad he is with us in spirit
its the dog actually speaking?
Sichuan is the best food region in China in my opinion, and it's always interesting to see how Japanese chefs take these Sichuan dishes and recreate them with Japanese style, thanks for posting this recipe :D
I miss francis so much :/
the lady is immortal
No sichuan pepper?
Are you ever going to get a new Puppy, Chef?
Buen provecho!
These are tears welling up. Just onions. Only onions.
I really want to see Francis in person.
I cried....Francis i miss you...
沖縄料理作ってみてください！
シェフのエプロンにかわいいフランシスを食べることは彼の記憶を尊重する素晴らしい方法です。Having the cute Francis on chef's apron is a great way to honor his memory.  ^_^
Viet Nam
!!!
We don't have pork belly slices here
Chef is so cute!!!
回锅肉嘛
❤️🌸
im sad and hungry...
👍🏼🙂
犬が。
yum
Hello, wanted to know if i could use napa cabagge instead of the spring cabbage we don't have here ? 新しいレシピいつもありがとうございます！！
How to cook it if i change the pork to chicken?
Thought they were really going to cook dogs.
Seriously? A Japanese woman cook fake Chinese food...
I feel so bad. My hero died.
先日14年姉妹のように育った大切な愛犬が亡くなりました。毎日毎日悲しくて何も手がつけられない日々です。今回フランシスがいなくなってからも素敵に美味しそうなお料理を作る動画を見て、私もしっかり食べて一生懸命生きなきゃいけないと思いました。
ありがとうございます。
Very interesting take on the dish.
May I ask if long green onion is leek? Also, why did you use vegetable oil instead of the pork fat after stir-frying pork slices? Thanks! Love your dishes as always!
Look so yummy.
雖然我不是四川人, 但是我記得回鍋肉應該是要把整塊Pork belly先過熱水煮熟再切片的吧? 如果是直接用生肉片過油煎, 會破壞口感ㄉ!
Where is the dog, i am looking for the dog but there no
Thank God you're Japanese. If you were chinese the video would have been cooking the dog.
Looks yummy can’t wait to try :)
お久しぶりですシェフさん！　今回もよくできました！　私はイタリア人だけどちょっと日本語を喋る事ができます。君のチャネルはいつもちょう面白いです！　フランシスはなくなって私もとても寂しいです。でもチェフさん頑張ってください！君はすばらしい人だから！　:)
Where's francis ?
down_star さん👋こちらの料理番組お勧めです！自炊出来る男はモテるョ。
Where is the dog?
What a novel idea - using/making what's only needed vs an insanely unnecessary amount that ends up going to waste! 👍👍👍 
I wish Western chefs would take note.  The worst offence is usually with marinade proportions SMH 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
First
I know Francis has passed away, so perhaps you should consider a name change
So lovely to see Chef again!! Love the tributes to Francis ❤️
Chef is so cute with her smile 😊😊
It's just francis opening greetings from the old taken video and combine with new video☺ miss the old days with francis😊 rip francis....ganbatte chef!😘
Chef, I hope you are doing well. I just wanted to say thank you to you and your family for all the work you have done and all the quality videos and recipes you have given.
Is no one going to say anything about the shirt talking?
OMG!  I love Cooking with Dog!   Makes me want to learn how to cook!  Thanks so much Francis and Chef.  Love what you do.
Miss you so so much chef!
That's such a nice picture of Francis in the background. Such handsome boi :] 💓

I miss him and I'm sure we all do. I'm always glad to hear his voice 👍

I LOVE U CHEF AND FRANCIS ❤❤❤ COOKINGWITHDOGFOREVER!!!
Yay, Chef is back! We missed you! <3

Chef looks so good! <3 I love seeing her look so healthy and happy!
We missed your sweet videos! : )
I therefore dub these

FRANCIS PAWS CREAM BREAD
❤️ love you Chef! Never clicked so fast!

I love this recipe and you chef but it freaked me out when I saw (around 1:40) Francis's mouth move on your apron... am I the only one who saw it?
こんなお母さんだったらなぁ❤️
エプロンのワンちゃん話してる！笑
Let's increase the views!! For francis and for our adorable chef!
These look amazing! I want to make it but I don't have all those fancy kitchen gadgets. XD I'll probably have to do it by hand. >_<" I miss Francis. T_T
Aww... Francis, we will never forget you 😢 Thank You, Chef for the wonderful new video!

Arigato gozaimas for another great recipe, chef. Always looking forward to another amazing recipe. Blessings🌺❤️
Wow! Those cream buns are so stunning! Chef is very talented. Such beautiful buns..I must try this out😀👍😙☕
I thought you guys saying the apron was talking were crazy.

I just noticed it.
Whenever I get to visit Japan, cream pan is my favorite at any Japanese bakery :-) This recipe also makes me want to watch an episode of Anpanman too.
Thank you for the wonderful video
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one for Teishoku pleeease...I'm a long time subscriber of your vids. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲

OMG the colour and perfect shape of the bread 👌😍
I really love how detailed the explanation is. Thanks chef
Chef-San always cooks beautifully! Sugoi desu!
I did not even notice her apron was talking. 
When I did I was less angry about there not being a real dog host.
9:30 Chef is literally adorable lol ❤️

Thanks for the new recipe! Looks delicious, I'm gonna try it soon!
Chef!! Thanks you for this delicious-looking recipe. I am glad to see you are still making videos 😊
私はパンを食べたい!!!!! ❤️🤤
Can I use pastry brush instead of a spray bottle? Currently I don't have one that can be used for cooking purposes. Great recipe and the buns look absolutely delicious. <3
Wow, they're so beautiful! Chef is so cute too. I've gotta try to make these sometime.
The cream pan looks incredible! Chef looks so happy too!~

Yaaaaay!!
What a wonderful recipe! Thank you, Chef!
Yeees! New dessert recipe! ❤️
Great job I love this recipe!
Just like I remember them! Chef's hair is so lovely, too.
Yum! I loved filled bread ♥️
1:27
egg yolk + sugar is probably the delicious food on the planet
just raw as is
not sure why its so good
Finally!!! Cooking with dog is back! Overjoyed!
Even though he is no longer with us, Francis and these videos still make me feel happy.
Good to see you again chef. Also to Francis. We 💜 you!
I dont have a bread machine...
I think I might have to buy a kitchen scale now. It would be really hard to get it perfect without one since I only have cups for measuring.
Saw the opening and screamed but then saw it was just an old opening 😭😭😭
Who is the voice of Francis?
Also, who is the lady cooking?
Cream filled bread? MY FAVORITE
Those pastries look so delicious!!  So nice to see a new video of CWD come up on my feed!!  Love you, Francis & Miss you, Pup!! xox
Wahh...the shape an colour looks so perfect!!
Omg francis's mouth is moving in the apron. Wait did he die? ;-;
Chef looked so beautiful and cheery in this vid 😍 Can't wait to try out this recipe.
How good to cut the Japanese plastic wrap!!!
I miss Francis so much (;_;)
I enjoyed the voice over!
Watch over Chief for us Francis we all love and miss you little guy. Glad to see you back Chief! 😊
I am always curious at who the voice-over person is. Anyone have an idea?
Gasp, francis is talking though her apron D:
Thanks for this video. I think you just gave me a hint for how to make my milk bread come out softer in the oven. Ive been trying to get a certain texture like thin pillows but it seems to come out too dry. I'll be sure to try next time☺. I love this channel
Your recipes is always awsome!! The recipes wasn't really hard to make 👍
Mmmmm delicious!
looks so complicated! Grandma took almost 2hrs to bake, and we just use 2mins to finish these yummy staff.
YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

Chef is so utterly, utterly charming! Always such a treat to see her work her magic ^_^
SO CUTEEEE!!!!love the dog!!
Glad to see you back Chef!
Chef, you are amazing and everything looks professionally done with everything you make. What can’t you cook?
これらは私の好きなスナックの一つです
Wow that looks so yummy!!😄
So cute and brilliant bake chef!! Must try this recipe
Thank you Chef for this recipe! They look so delicious I really want to try to make them!
Your custard recipe was very easy to make, and delicious. I used the custard to bake blueberry custard buns.
I love this >< (I'm fans from Thailand)
I didn't realize that Francis was talking on her apron at some points during the video, how cute!
thanks! from México :)
Chef you are looking so well!
Ahhh~it’s so nice seeing you again :)
It's so perfect ❤
"You like button"

Wow so delicious, I absolutely love your channel
I just noticed that Francis on Chef's apron is talking! So cute!
Yes omg my grandma would make us those every time she came to visit❤️❤️

For pan I think it means Bun in English?
Chef, you’re adorable <3
this channel is so, so wholesome
they look like cat paws

Yummy, but needs lots of skills and patience 🌷
Love your food chef.
Seeing  how much  she enjoys cooking makes me want to try myself :)
Tough week ends with CwD video - week turned 90% less tough
1:40 Francis talks on chefs apron👀❤️
Everyone should enjoy cooking like chef!
Is there any good reliable bread maker?
Is it just me or does chef look younger every episode? ;)
I NEED THAT BREAD MAKER PLEASE. 😤
Thanks for sharing this. I made this today with kitchenaid worked well too. For some reason I can generate 9 buns with just 2 egg yorks for the custards.. But still full of fillings.. It's a crowd pleaser... Love it...
I just tried these tonight and they are SO good! The cream is wonderfully smooth, and the bun is light and sweet, and beautifully golden brown. Thank you Chef for sharing this recipe with us!
Those came out beautifully! Thank you chef :)
they look so beautiful 😍
焼き色綺麗…！深夜にお腹が…w
糖質制限していて最近パンとか作ってないけど

OMG these look so good! I’ve only had the red bean paste buns before. The chef is so freaking adorable!!!!
thank you for sharing with us this delicious Japanese cuisine, この美味しい日本料理を私たちと共有してくれてありがとう
How if I don't have that machine? Could i use rice cooker or maybe an oven?
We love you chef!! :3
Thought I was seeing things when I noticed Francis talking on her apron 😁😁😁
Is it just me or is this music from Yuru Camp?
She just seems so happy with this pan! It must be one of her favorites. I will have to try it.
ohh i can't wait to try this one!
That looks amazing I want to eat that soooo bad but I don't have anything to make that
Have an amazing day Chef!!! 💛
You’re back! ♥️
おいしそう♡
So happy to see you, Chef!

めぐうぃん
Japan man. They got a machine for making cake dough.
Great! I really missed them!!
<3
I try this recipe is very yummy thank you
I haven't even seen Cooking with Dog videos for a while cause I couldn't bear to watch them after Francis' death. Now seeing this again and seeing him in the beginning of the video and picture frame almost made me cry just now.
They look amazing
i didnt notice at first her apron is talking, thats so cute
Love u chef....
これはおいしいよ！素晴らしいビデオ、シェフさん！
つごいねえ! Much love from the USA chef!
Awesome, Thank-You
scrumptious!!
What happens to Francis?
I love this
Nice lady
it's like a custard filled empanada!
Francis spoke!!!
I saw Francis! 😭😭😭
We love  you chef
Nice touch with the talking dog animation on your apron.
Francis! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
im tripping out i dont see Francis
;-;

We miss you! Thanks for your videos!!
Kawaii

This reminded me of some things I needed to buy (scale, etc), so now I want to make it when I get them!

That looks super delicious!
Go down to the pound and get a replacement Francis.
Love to watch your video 😋 Yummy 👍🏻
Lovely! 😊👍
❤
1300-are-you-slapping
So pretty
I suggest you to make fried tofu donuts
Those are such beautiful eggs.
I wish chef was my mother
😍😍😍
Be my grandma please 🙏🏽
so sweet
Hi, hello from Mexico, I love your channel 💐 here I can not find an oven like yours, could you please provide me with the brand and the model please? I would appreciate it infinitely.
I cannot eat gluten, but I had a homemade gluten-free custard cream bun this April for my birthday, almost exactly one week after you uploaded this. What a good treat!
Hello! I love your recipies and following you since years!! This is one of my favourite bakings, also fairly easy to make! If I may say, the custard cream is a bit too sweet so I'd put half or maximum 2/3 of the 55g of sugar, and less salt in the dough, but anyway the rest is perfect! This is just my taste... Thank you for the ongoing effort on making new videos! Big fan here!
Will you get a puppy?
Chef is so cute 😆
それは例えばアラブなど非常に英語の強い中東訛りのように聞こえていたが、しかし普通日本の訛りよりも酷く、素晴らしいだった内容はです
私はイントネーションで改善期待をしています
We love you, Chef!
good to see you again ...
You don't mix the ingredients in the bread maker? How does it mix?
I want to taste that cream pan now
she's kitchen magician!!!
Um....Your name was greatly misunturputed.
Where do you buy most of your cooking appliances?
the narration is difficult to follow.   It's better to either type out simple instructions on screen without any narration.
Great video
When I let the breads prove in the oven at 40° with steamer function they spread out and became very flat... 
Any solutions to this problem?
Mmm looks so yummy! I love cooking with dog! Chef and Dog are so cute!
Nice and soft bun..
They forgot to mention the yeast in the video, but it does need yeast, is in the list of ingredients. be carefull fellas :)
Anyone know the name of the song at 9:45?
She's so cute <3 T.T
Balloon wheesk
変に頑張ってなくて、すごく分かりやすい英語です。 クリームパン、今から焼きます。
There is no cake flour in UK or Ireland. How to make it?
Delicious

I'm on a keto diet 😩I wish I could eat this right now !
Ahhh my favorite japanese pastry was posted on my bday💓💓
How old is your dog?
Francis 🐩🐩🐩😢😢😢😇😇😇❤❤❤
はじめまして、こちらの動画を参考にクリームパン作りました。お店みたいな焼きたてクリームパンが作れて感動しました、本当にありがとうございます！他のレシピにも挑戦してみます。
Where is the dog?? What happen to the dog?? It’s cooking with dog but there is no dog
ワンコの供養が済んだら、2代目を探して下さいね！！！！
思い出だけに、捕らわれてはいけないですからね。

Baked sauce anglaise gyoza ...
Wait, so the dog DIDN'T die? Than what was that RIP video for?
What happened to Chopin? I used to love listening to the recipes at the sound of Minute Waltz, what a pity that you changed so drastically the soundtrack.
aww i miss the doggie but her SHIRT IS MOVING LOL
When I first started watching this show, I was 14. Couldn't cook anything to save my life, and these recipes seemed so delicious, but so hard, I thought I could never do them. Now it's nearly nine years later; I finally have a kitchen of my own, and my boyfriend and I are making Chef's recipes! Thank you so much for staying with us for so long and continuing to share your love of cooking. We hope our cooking would make you and dear Francis proud!
i miss the baby. but she's clearly honoring the memory with the stand-in toy, apron, the artwork and even the mug on the shelf.
Ok either my high is out of control or Francis on the apron is talking.
You still got fans Francis! Stay beautiful baby.
I miss Francis sniffles RIP Good Boy <3 Now I need to buy a t-shirt and apron.
It's been so long since I've watched a video from this channel. I forgot how much I love how cute and amazing this channel is!
Shit, I can’t make it through these videos without shedding a tear over Francis rip :/
Yummy looking recipe.  I will definitely try this.  Did anyone notice the dog's mouth on her shirt moving while the man was narrating? :)
I loved the little fun facts about the ingredients sprinkled throughout the video!
A very heartwarming bowl of udon :) Thank you for sharing the recipe, chef!
Please bring back the talking Francis picture in the corner when the apron isn't in view. I liked that a lot... it's not a live Francis but it gets the job done!
I cried a bit I miss good boy Francis. my stomach cry too, this look so tasty!!
It's been more than a year since Francis' passing but it still hurts :(
Noooooooo! When did Francis... poor baby puppy... rest in peace, master chef.
It's upsetting to watch without seeing Francis move around in his little bed, whimper when he sees the food so close to him, and sometimes watching him lay down and yawn. I continue supporting this channel as well as everyone else who watches new uploads. Much love to the family and of course, Francis!
Cooking Without Dog :(
❤️❤️❤️so happy to have you back! :)
I didn't notice the apron at first. I thought I was buggin out 😄
I always think Chef is so cute. She makes me smile! ^^
美味しそうなのに、悲しくなる…😭みんなわんちゃんが大好きだったんだなあとしみじみしてしまいますね。
It looks amazing, chef! Thank you for continuing to give us these videos!
This is not a cooking channel it is a hypnotism channel  at its finest
Wow!! Apron talks!
エプロンのフランシスがしゃべった!!!
Thank you chef for continuing to make videos! we love you and hope you are doing well!
フランスで全部の材料見つけないよ
赤味噌結構
太いうどん現在は結構
ドライ椎茸結構（生見つけない）
それでもやってみたいっ！
Who the heck is down-thumbing this video... SRSLY!
とっても美味しそう！寒い冬にぴったりですね！いつも応援しています
Noooo why why! 😤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
 May we all pay our respects to Frances 
R.I.P Frances you will never be forgotten.
it's always great to see your videos poping up on my subscription list, always a delight to watch them.

Excelente!
Delicioso!
Abrazos desde México Maravilloso,, Mágico
Miso is one of my favorite flavors. I’m definitely going to try to make this (without the chicken)
Love love cooking with dog!! I've been watching for years! You make me really love cooking and trying new foods! Thank you! 💕
Francis will always live on forever. Love the apron, but if there's a Pop Figure of Francis, that would be nice. That udon looks great.
美味しそう！残念ながら、チキンを食べられないから、代わりにもっと豆腐を使ってみたいです :)
Whenever i see the new videos i want to cry cause frist a painting. And now a plush. ;;;m;;;
Oh man, now this I HAVE to try! I'm a sucker for udon
Looks delicious as always 💕
お元気そうで安心しました(^_^)
CHEF PLEASE TEACH US TO MAKE TONJIRU~ (≧▽≦)
I just realised Francis speaks on her apron.
;—; I miss him (´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)
What made you want to have Francis's voice in English? And chef always makes such yummy food! Keep on cooking!♡ much love
I am still a fan, subbed for years. RIP francis
i've been wanting to try make this kind of udon for a while. thank you so much for sharing this recipe ～ 😊
美味そう
When you say coming soon how long? I want that bread so much!
THIS UDON LOOKS SOOOOO GOOD!
Happy to see another video Chef🙇 and Francis. 

I can sure use a bowl of this deliciousness right now 😋 so simple, time to go shopping!
I live for Cooking with Dog.
this makes me so hungry. thank you for the delicious recipes and well produced videos every week! i love the blooper clips of chef at the end 😂
I'm salivating... Wow <3
I love this recipe! Looks delicious! Now that I'm living alone and have the kitchen to myself, I can't wait to try these recipes.
OML THE APRON IS MOVING, EDITOR YOU HAVE MY DEEPEST RESPECT

Also the dish looks really taste!
Dear Chef, we are so happy that you are back <3 Francis lives on in our hearts and in your soulful cooking.
Thank you for another wonderful recipe 😍❤️
動画。。。まってました!!!!!
Delicious, quickly a Udon beef recip ! ^_^ !
いつもありがとう
thanks for keeping the channel. it's one of my favorite and more now that I live in Japan. 頑張ってください！
OMG THAT APRON HAHAHAHA!!! This show is still amazing. Possibly the most technically skilled chef on youtube. Frances would be so proud! Man I am hungry
This recipe looks especially delicious. Thank you.
I was not expecting a video ;A; I though my eyes were plating tricks on me, but the apron is talking xD I've been wanting to try udon for a long time, I try it with this recipe! Thank you
Please never stop mesmerizing us with your amazing cooking! You're admirable, sensei!!
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one please. I'm a long time subscriber of your vids. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲
This Chanel is probably the 1st foodtube 🤙
I greatly enjoy these videos. Thank you and R.I.P. to the doggie. One question: I thought boiling the liquid is not advisable with miso since it could kill the benefits of the miso, is this not so?
This dish looks wonderful, Cooking With Dog always makes my day ^^
I love miso and this seems like a good recipe to try! Perfect because we also have some udon in the house!
Question, which one is better , dry udon or those vaccum packed wet udon?
Keep up the great recipe calls chef :)
Beautiful Francis! You live in our hearts, forever!
HEHEHEH THE CHANEL STILL LIVES OMG IM SO GLAD YOURE STILL GOING WE MISS FRANCIS ALOT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STAYING!!!
BTW this dish looks amazing
I'm so happy you keep going with the show and honoring Francis with so much love. Also amazing recipe!
All the Francis pictures and Francis items made me cry. I still miss him. We still love you, Francis! Good boy!!
looks delicious! thank you for another great video, chef! 💛
I love the fact that francis' memory still lives on!  :)
was wondering when you pointed out that you shoulnt boil miso for too long
Its been so cold here recently this is just what I need, Chef! Gonna go grab the ingredients to make this tomorrow.
Nice to see you Chef! Keep up the good work.
😭😭😭😭😭 FRANCIS!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Looks delicious!!  Thank you for honoring the memory of Francis.  We all miss him very much!!  Francis, in our hearts forever. <3
That's delicious, chef.
Thank you very much
I DIDN’T NOTICE THE APRON WOW. miss you francis 💕
It seems delicious! ♡
I wanna make this dish so badly but I'm sure here in Manaus we don't have some of these ingredients ; -;
Awww this looks so incredibly delicious, but I can't find half the ingredients at my store :'(
You're doing a great job. Please do keep on.
Wonderful to watch. I love how you describe where each ingredient originates from, and its qualities and history. ♥
The kamaboko is so aesthetically pleasing... And I want some udon now!
袋のままレンジでチン！ 簡単🎵 レシピありがとです( ˊ꒳ˋ ) ᐝ
Hi guys! I'm from Brazil and I love your channel and the recipes. I'm here to ask you if you could make a video of how to make monaka shells, please? It's been so difficult to find a tasty monaka in Brazil, nowadays, that I'm planning to make it on my own. Could you help me please? Tks in advance =D
Udon topped with a beautifully cooked egg! My favourite kind of food! ❤️ I've missed your videos. Somehow I feel the spirit of Francis is still with us with this upload. Everything about it is just classic 'Cooking with Dog'. And I adore the talking Francis on the apron.
Using the same bumper music as Orvis Fly-fishing instructor video.
This looks amazing! Thank you, chef, we love you! Thank you, Francis, we miss you!
Nagoya red miso?

I didn’t like it the first few times I had it (I lived in Nagoya), but finally one day I craved it and now that I can’t have it I miss it. I think it’s an acquired taste. It’s very strong, and a bit sour or tangy? I can’t describe it lol (I’m bad at taking about food), but it’s definitely worth 5 trys haha. 

Can you make [Nagoya] red miso tonkatsu?
I want to eat my screen!!!!
Looking really delicioussss!!! Please keep up the good work! I love your videos.
rip to the legend forever in my heart
A video from you after so long! Hope you're doing great:)
Wow! I want to make this for dinner tomorrow, I will invite my friends to try it! :)
I will proudly wear the Francis t-shirt I got from winning the last video contest when making this <3
Francis is everywhere! I miss Francis, he was such a good doggy!
I’m so glad chef is still sharing recipes with us. The spirit of Francis lives!
BEST part of my day always
I made this tonight. So delicious! Love it! Thank you Chef for sharing the recipe:)
Still missing you, Francis! Voice of Francis is always doing a good job!
Thank you for the new video! Missed you, chef and Francis so much! ❤️
大好きです(*^_^*)いつも楽しみに見てます
This looks so awesome! will definetly try this dish. I'm glad that you guys are uploading again :D
Chef welcome back!!  We miss you!
So adorable that the apron is  talking! The us in dish looks wonderful,  can't wait to try it 🤗
Oh I missed you! I know Francis is watching from dog heaven and cheering for your new videos. 
I am definitely making this in the week. Much love! :)
i miss francis :"( the doll makes me sad
DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT THE MOUTH FROM THE DOG ON CHEF'S APRON WAS MOVING. HAHAHA
I live in Nagoya ! Please eat Miso Nikomi Udon when you visit to Nagoya.
味噌煮込みだー！！(*∩ω∩)💕
Francis my poor babes...rest in peaceBut, lovely food chef, stay strong and keep it up!
I made it for dinner just now, it was delicious!!
Made it without the chicken and kamaboko. No chicken because I try to not consume a lot of meat and no kamaboko because it was sadly unavailable. Also, I added enoki mushrooms. I'm definitely going to be making it again soon!
This looks AMAZING! 😍
Great movie! Hereabouts at Y&S FOOD! we all love to find this kind of contents. We create Travel & Food videos as well, anywhere in the world, and so we are constantly searching inspirations and perhaps creative concepts. Thank You.
I want that apron more than most things in life.
Looks delicious! I live in Dallas, Texas and there is a Mitsuwa grocery nearby. I’m going to pick up the ingredients...hopefully I can find that kind of miso. It’s thundering and raining today so this looks like the perfect dish to accompany the weather. Thank you for another great tutorial, Chef! ❤️
This made my mouth water, I can't wait to make this when I got home from work! :)
We miss you and recipes! 😪
hi sweetheart! hope you are well! xx
The speaker sounds just like the guy from tabi eats
Microwave? really ? It destroys everything nutricious ...
Francis will live on forever ❤
It looks so tasty! Udon noodles are one of my favorites because they're so thick and soft ❤️
thanks for posting a new video.it's been so cold lately in san francisco. this is the perfect dish for a cold and windy day!
I am happy you are back! I miss Francis so much, but you did a great job honouring him <3
Everything you make is oishiisoo!
Chef~I really enjoyed this. I can't wait to try it. I think I can find all the ingredients either in my city or online. 
I'm not specifically speaking of the food, but also the pot this is cooked in.
Please keep doing this as long as you want to. Fans would prefer that be forever. ☺ 
Francis is able to speak from doggy heaven! YAY I hope he never tires of helping you and his fans. It warms me inside to see a new CWD.
Thank you Chef 💖💖💖
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
🤤 drooling, yummy 😋
i love miso.  recipe looks great...and so do you, chef!
This looks delicious!  I have been looking for a nice simple udon recipe, I believe I have found it.
I'M HUNGRY !!!
It's getting cold here.. I will try this recipe! looks good on cold days
Oooo looking forward to the next video!
It's so good to have you back, chef!
That looks so tasty!  Thank you, Francis.
I miss Francis.. So much
Wow I absolutely love this! You are so thorough with the instructions I feel like I could recreate this and it would turn out perfectly!
One's Was My Favorite :)!!
How dare people dislike this video. CHEF IS DOING HER BEST
One of my favourite comfort foods!  It's perfect in winter.
Francis is alive on the apron!!! ToT
As who's name the channels name was ,now he is no more ,I can't believe it.
Beautiful food as always Chef!
YUMMM
I use to come home from school and open up my laptop to watch your show. Thanks for being there in my childhood. Hopefully I can prepare some of these recipes in my friend's dorm.
When are y'all getting a new dog? Francis #2, Francis Harder
美味しそう！ 🤤
I have been following this channel for almost 3 years and it always makes my depression episodes easier. Thanks, Chef, you brought a lot of different people together and taught us a lot. I am cooking whenever I can and I find it quite therapeutic.  Some of my dishes were very edible. :)
Would this work with dry kishimen noodles too?
ever wanted to hear a japanese dog speak english with a french/italian accent? yes
this looks so yummy!!!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR COOKING WITH DOG TO DO THIS VIDEOOOOOOOOO OMFGGGGGGGG YESSSSSS
Chef is so beautiful god bless her. チェフはすごいきれいだ、だいすき！
This channel will always be wonderful <3
Wonderful recipe to make on a cold weather day. 🐩
You didn't know how many times i have to rewind and rewind because I thought I was hallucinating! You'll always be remembered Francis!
I made this today using red miso and it is soooo good <3
AM I HIGH OR WAS THAT APRON TALKING?!
Francis ... You live in my Heart forever 😍😘😥😭😭😭
I really don't they don't stop making this...I loved watching it
Maybe it would be nice if chef gave a demonstration how she cuts those spring onions so finely. I never seem to get it right.
Also, would a pan with a thick bottom also work for this dish (or any kind of hotpot? We don't have earthen pots where I live, and this is the only other solution I can think of.
I just love everything. Especially when she is tasting the food. :3
Before it was called Cooking With Dog, now it's Wooking With stuffed Toy Dog.
Always support you ♡
I saw Frances talking!!!
This amazing cooking channel never changes :)
Mmmm... can't wait to try this recipe!  :)
oh shit I didn't realized till like halfway through the video I looked down and her shirt was talking
I like to watch Japanese cooking
The 1rst cookin' channel I fell in luv with on the 'Tube, and still great n' adorable as ever!!!!!! Cook in peace, dear Francis...
finally some new video, it's been soooo long
Can I use dried shrimps for dashi too? Bonito flakes are very expensive in my country.
It looks very tasty. Could you translate your videos to Arabic?
I want to make this but them ingredients ExOtIC
Where's Francis?!?!??!?!?! I haven't watched your video in over a year.....
Apron Francis talks! :O kinda creepy
Like!!!!!!! Like like like!!!!!!!!!!!!!
美味しそう！
あらっ？
フランシスはっ？！
only seeing the photo makes me salivating!!!
I know our pets are also family members and with thats said  . . . . .
its been almost 2 years , maybe just maybe  , we can look for the next Francis  , maybe one that isnt so sleepy
RIP Francis , but life goes on
お母さん。。。。いつもお疲れ様です。。。。お元気で。。。。😊
Looks so delicious! 😍
小麦アレルギーになってしまっておうどんが食べられなくなりました
とても美味しそうです；ｗ；
小麦アレルギーでも食べられるおうどんぽいもののレシピがあると歓喜します＞＜＊
Francis is in our heart forever.

お久しぶりでした！レシピありがとうございます😊
Chef Daisukii!!
ごぼう入れると更に香りが良いですよ！
フランシス、天国でも美味しい物を食べて
どうか、安らかに
Udon cooked in the microwaves ?? wow I need to try this way next time :D
If we don't have the ceramic cooking pot can we use cast iron?
That looks amazing!
the hardest thing for me is finding the ingredients
bu, anjingnya udah meninggal ya? sedih saya
Frances 💔
I really want that apron!!! It's so cute!
We all love and miss the doggie. 😭😭😭😭 dog had a wonderful life with much love.
Awwwww ;__;
she is adorable! I really like her smile her attitude.
Love all the Francis memorabilia!
can you make this with dried udon instead? would you need to fully cook the noodles beforehand or only partially cook them?
thanks~
halfway through the video, i realized that the Francis on the apron was talking and I started freaking out.
I miss Francis  :''(
Where can I buy an apron like that?
Forever in my heart
the chicken doesn't need more cooking time?
I LOVE YOU FRANCIS!!!
Wait--- is that plushy doggie an official Francis?? Can we buy it?
Love how you only need to use one pot to make this dish!
💕💖💞💗we love you chef💖💕💞💗
かまぼこ・・・どうしたのですか？（●＾o＾●）
miss you dogie
Hey Chef!
Any suggestions on how to subsitute the Kamaboko Fish Cake? Would Naruto or Sashimi work? That's the only things somewhat close to it, that I can get where I live.
Or would it be allright to just skip? :) 

Thanks for all the great recipes. Love trying them <3
Oh shit! That dog is haunting that lady's apron!
I thought i was still drunk when i saw her apron moving
It looks sooo good, especially the egg-dipped noodles at the end X3
She's adorable ❤
<3
Good! ❤️ brava!
Rip francus
Aww i miss francis
Think that 2016 is already bad, well 2017 is more worse. Deaths like AGP which is Charles Green and others like Ed Blaylock, Bill Paxton, Rich Piana, Auntie Fee. RIP Francis
ワンコが、ぬいぐるみと写真に成ってしまいましたね。
残念！！

ゴメンね。見直したら３ヶ月前で、思い出の犬に成ってしまいましたね。失礼。
It looks delicious, Chef!
Good job, Chef! That looks delicious. I doubt most of those ingredients are available here in Colorado USA but one never knows, I guess.
why not get a new dog.
Love this show!
アップして頂き有難うございます。本当に美味しそうな一品ですね。これからもよろしくお願いします。
Oh no! It's been awhile since I watched this channel...is Frances dead?
I GET SO EXCITED WHEN THERE’S A NEW VIDEO BECAUSE OF HOW LONG ITS BEEN SINCE THE LAST VIDEO!!! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
I looks so good! Yum!! 😋
お久しぶりです, どうもありがとうございます。
can you make this without chicken and still have it taste good?
RIP Francis... :'^(
cut it in bite size pisis
Missing you and Francis. So happy to see you here again.......
The level of adorableness in these videos are over 9000!!!
New Subscriber , sir Francis cook for us sometime, we want to see you cooking too please 🙏🏼🙏🏼
I love his accent😂
OISHISOU
I too miss Francis,I mostly can't watch this channel cuz it still hurts not having him. No offense chef,I do actually enjoy you too
This looks amazing!!!! Yummy!
Looks yummy, and easy to make!   ネギ isn't often available in my area.  I usually substitute spring onions, but hesitate to do so since the recipe already calls for spring onions.  Ideas for substitution?  My family enjoys the CwD recipes.  Some of them are now family favorites that I make regularly.  Thanks for all the recipes!
What the?? Did Francis die!? Omg poor doggo 😭😭
Sugar and mirin? Is this sweet?
WHERE IS THE DOGGO!!!!!! :(
just get a new dog damn
❤❤❤❤❤
I can’t believe the poodle is gone.
I AM SO SAD
Delicious 🤤😍
1:50 エプロンのわんこの口が動いててビックリしたわｗ
Love to see Cook and Francis cooking again.
I love you!!!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DOG AND THE GRANDMAAA !!!!
でも、寂しいです！フレンシスの写真やぬいぐるみを見ると涙が出ますよ
Wait wait does anyone notice whenever Francis speaks you can see her apron or shirt of the dog's lips move?
This bubbling pot of udon looks so deliciously good in these cold months!!
Mmmmmmm😋👏👏👏👏
yeyy !! a recipe that i can make in a rice cooker as a college student hehe
お久し振りです😀
何時も楽しみにしています。
お肉料理をよく作るのですが、お肉が柔らかくならなくて😥何時も主人が残してしまいます😭柔らかくなるにはどうしたらよいですか❓
You should publish a cookbook!
Where is that sweet poodle dog?🙁
DARN IT i dont have red miso i have awase misoooooooo
항상 건강하세요 ^^ 매번 영상 잘 보고있습니다
写真だけでよくわかりませんが、次は。。。もしかしてクリームパン？！:o
Thank you for the recipe - we love you, Chef, and we miss you, Francis <3
The dog it was that died LOL
あんざ かまぼこ ふぃっしゅけーく
I love it!
U r superwoman for me 😍😍
Looks good!
Am I the only who noticed that the dog on the apron is also "talking"... Like there's a mouth moving with the narrative.. haha.
What exactly is the pot called??
Wait, where is Francis? 😭😭😭
Oishi
I take it she will not get another dog as francis cannot be replaced...the cgi on her apron is really cool!
I love this. :)
She is so adorable!
Looks absolutley delicious! Will try this soon.
私はそれ以上のことはできません！それはとてもいいね！
Francis' spirit must be here too...
I love the plush dog :)!!
Japanese microwaves look awesomely complicated :)
สุนัขไปไหนครับ
エビマヨの動画をお願いします！
RIP doge
thats a cool microwave
RIP Francis. Love Francis
I havent been watching this Channel for a while n I had a weird dream that this dog was gone n i didnt think much but now that Im here I know Why I had that dream
I don't want to be that guy but why doesn't she get a new dog I understand Francis was her best buddy but there's nothing wrong with a new best friend
I need that microwave
I wish Chef was my mum, she is wonderful... :) her little smile is so nice to see :D
year of the dog, year of the francis, rip doggo
Foodgasm Kampai🍻🍶
Now this looks good.
Whre is the dog? 
It is  deth?
How do you recommend cooking the noodles if you don’t have a microwave
Can you tell me what's wrong with dog?
I'm gonna try to make this dish, but  mirin is expensive in my place, what the substitute for replacing mirin in this case??
Me like button!
Wow look sooo delicious!
Delicious! :)
I tend to choose soba noodles over Udon because I always feel that Udon is too thick to absorb any flavor and will taste very bland. Soba on the other hand, you can dip it in the sauce and the thin noodles will be well coated with the sauce. This recipe however, emphasizes the strong miso and dashi being part of the ingredients which I think will solve the thick and bland Udon problem. I will definitely try it out, thank you chef! 😊
It's kind of sad seeing that stuffed dog.
This looked delicious
what kind of pot is that?? where can i find it??
Yay
So the guy talking is the dog?
Francis is gone but can you guess which other Francis is gone?
I just started watching this channel and now I’m caught up with their videos and Francis is gone. I’m devastated 😢
Gonna have to make this soon... I have most of the ingredients now....
Best of all, the only thing I can't find in a supermarket is the kamaboko. Those surimi crab sticks are as close as it gets, and works for me. That, and the fried tofu like this comes in a can meant for inarizushi. But easy enough to just pan fry some or leave it out.
Brasiiiillll
What's the purpose of cutting them diagonally?
That looks delicious!
I only ever had white miso what is the difference between red miso
Cooking without Dog
I heard Francis died, but watched a "recent" video (that was like 1 or 2 years ago) and he was alive so I thought that were just lies, but I saw this today and gotta say that it hurted a little bit when I just saw a plush and a photo of Francis. Rest in peace, Doggy.
Super
Where is Francis?
ooh, the dish looks tasty !
Yumy
Franciiiiissss xC
NO? where is the dog?!
must be delicious!!simple foog and an lot of god thing in it
oh the stuffed poodle is so sad. I am high and I miss Francis because I know the voice-over is no longer really the dog.
Wow
awesome
omg for second I thought the doggo died since there was a photo of 'em in the background.
My two year old loves udon!
I watched this show for many years. Beautiful and delicious Japanese food easy to cook when I’m in overseas. I just cook and having oyako don, next time try udon.
am i the only one who thinks it's beyond creepy that they still make videos with a dog that died two years ago??
ああ！美味しそう！ 八丁みそ今度探して作ってみたいです！豆全般大好き人間なのでみそも大好きです。
次回のクリームパンも楽しみ❤️いつもありがとうございます😊
NANI
八丁味噌は苦手だったんですがシェフが作っているのを見てすごく興味が湧きました。
今度作ってみます:-)
ええ、フランシスは死んだと知りません。:'(
жалко собачку
Does anyone happen to know why kamaboko is usually dyed in bright colors?
Awww the apron.
I donut like the raw  eggs on dishes so much.. . But this looks tasty
Where's her dog??
what happened to francis,  why the dog is not here ? 🙁
I'm sorry but the doll (dog) is creepy.
Hello from Kansas! I've been following your channel for aong time and occasionally make what you feature in your videos. Being from Kansas makes it hard to get some of the ingredients easily found in Japan, but I managed to make this one myself, although I DID have to make my own kamaboko and Aburaage. It turned out well and other than the egg and mushrooms my kids loved it too! They now want to go back and watch more of your videos and pick something else for me to make. Thanks, Chef!
Raw egg... 🤢
Great video.It looks soo tasty! :)
What happen with the cute dog
I see the chef using a white knife with fish, seafood and meat.  What is the knife.  And, why is this knife being used.
Did they just microwave the udon in it’s plastic wrap? 0-0 is that safe?
I need to work on my japanese accent so it sounds just like him then I’m gonna make people speak super slow English to me all the time.
Does this go well with beef or pork?
Is it true that if you bite the noodles that you will receive bad luck?
Firstttt!!!!!!
おいちい
Where is the dog?
In Nagoya, they do not use sugar. They use Saikyou miso instead.
Wait. Did the dog die or something? :(
Very nice!
what happened did she eat the real dog?
It takes a weak man to replace a friend.
wait..what happened to Francis!!!
when will you cook your dog?
Recipe looks really good , but her knife skills are questionable, surprisingly she hasn’t hacked her fingers off.....
Get a new dog
I've watched you for years and it's truly heartwarming that you came back for us!
So happy you are still making videos. It's not the same without Francis, but at the same time, it is. He's there in spirit, in every video still :)
My dog died a few days ago. His name was rex. Someone in my neighborhood poisoned him. I felt really sad and depressed but then I saw you. You were able to be strong and move on so,so will I. Great recipe BTW. thank you 😊
I miss Francis ❤️
I'm happy to see you smiling chef and that your videos are back! 😍 The apron is so kawaii and I like that you decided to immortalize Francis in your videos. I'm sure he's happy in dog heaven. 💓
I miss Francis :(
5:07 Chef's laugh is so precious 🤣
Omg! Francis on her apron is actually talking! Adorable!
Thank you for the video, Chef! We miss Francis but we are happy to see you!
i didnt think id be so goddamn upset over a dog i've never met but this dog taught me about japanese food. im a cook this is some heavy shit man this means something to me. imma keep supporting the channel but damn this is sad feeling.
Francis that name will always be important to me because of this. ALl the blessings to everyone involved in this channel
good to see chef is still smiling :D
It's kind of telling how something that is so much healthier than most average American dishes is used to fatten up japanese Sumo wrestlers...
This is the first time I've watched sine Francis went to doggy heaven, and it made me so happy to see him talking on Chef's apron!
I was having a bad day but this made it better ♡
So happy you are back again in sharing your delicious recipes that I can make it at home. Thank you Francis 😍
I love you Chef, thank you for sharing this hot recipe for cold weather lately. :)
Hello! Congratulations! I really like your recipes! I miss Francis, but I know he's pretty happy playing with friends in the stars.
Oishi oishi recipe!!!!Francis would be so happy up there :) Always love your recipe!!
Omg i never noticed that the mouth of the dog is moving as the Chef is talking
I love you, Francis & Chef!!! You guys are the reason why I went to culinary school! Best decision of my life. ❤️
OMG! Soooooo cute! Francis talking on the apron‼️ 😍☺️😍
👩🏻‍🍳Chef, you look so 👍🏻 n radiant 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 ! 
💃🎶💃🎶Happy New Year! Wishing you pink of health in 2018!
Thank You💐🐰 for continuing to cook for us!
I stopped watching this channel for a bit because I wasn't getting updates. I was so sad to hear of Francis' passing, but it makes me so happy to see that you are continuing the show. ♥
Thank you Chef!
I couldn't help but smile when I saw you're video. My day is always that much better whenever you post.
This looks delicious and just right for the cold winter days we're having right now! p.s.  I LOVE the little bloopers at the end, so cute xD
Thank you chef for coming back! best wishes from Bolivia, the heart of South America.
we love you so much chef!
I'm hoping I can try this soon!! Would you consider making Hokkaido Milk Bread for a video at some point? It looks super fluffy and tasty, and I know whatever you make is going to be top notch!
Francis on the apron talks so detailed 😭
Did anyone see fancis talk on her apron at @4:34?
I have a very problematic food inolerance but I found so many recipes that are easy to alter so even I can eat them without problems. Thank you so much!
Does anyone notice francis's mouth (on chef's apron) moving at the beginning? Or it just me...
always brings me back nostalgic memories of early youtube
The food on this channel looks amazing every single time!
This channel makes me so happy.
I feel so uncomfortably hungry watching this
What a perfect dish for our wet and cold winter! Thank you, Chef!

Talking Apron-Francis was nice suprise👍
Beautiful work chef! I love the recipe it's so fresh! :)
Where can I get a talking apron too? :D
Oishi!  Healthy and good.
I love the opening theme of this channel! I also discovered the Minute Waltz from your videos, great music choices!
Thanks for continuing to make videos for us chef, can't wait til the next one!
Beautiful recipe chef! Thank you for all your hard work!
Love and miss you Francis! My first ever subscription to youtube was this channel! xoxo

Always delighted to see another recipe video from my favorite cooking channel on YouTube!
Thanks, Chef.  This one looks especially delicious.   Now to find a source for the fried tofu....

シェフのレシピ大好きです（●＾o＾●）
What's the song that starts playing at 1:49 ? I keep hearing it in my head whenever I'm cooking :P
It is so good to see another video Chef! You make my day so bright when you post.
Interesting. How does this dish make one gain weight, though? Most of the ingredients are quite healthy and light.
This looks like the perfect hot and gently soothing meal for these cold Winter nights 💖 thank you very much for always working so hard! Very much love from California ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I want to see weekly uploads :'(
I love these videos, keep them coming :D
One of my favs channel since... years :D

I´ve had recurring nightmares ever since francis passed away , thank you for coming back.
Yay ^^ looks so good
Looks delicious!  I do not want to look like a wrestler, so maybe I skip the butter! 😀
I love the chef's face after she dropped the butter into the ramen

シメがおいしそう！！
Thanks very much for sharing your recipe.

Hello
Glad to see another video! But, now I'm hungry...
Looks so good!
CWD uploaded a video - this will be a good week.
I still support and watch your videos even tho I miss Francis so much 😩
I started watching and making some of your recipes when I was 11 now I'm 21 I still love the channel and miss Francis. 💘💔 and I love the adorable talking Francis! 🤣👌

Yum!
Sooo cute! The little Francis on Chef's apron moves his mouth

How does sumo wrestelers gain weight with such light dish,i mean it's not that fat,i can eat it everyday!
🤔.

I accidentaly click on the blog and laugh at the description of the blog; Cooking with Dog (it's not what you think...). loool.
Love this nabe, Chef! Definitely will try this out, thank you!
It is not the same without him 😭😭 R.I.P
We all miss Francis 😢 and love chef ❤️
Woowee that's was a chunk of butter xD
3:51 is the dog on that on apron talks  or i am loosing my mind
First time I'm watching since Francis' passing. Looking forward to more videos!
first time viewer of this channel..what an unbelievably delightful experience!
Looks great!
私は今、ラーメンを食べるように感じる（* 3 *）
数年ぶりに拝見しました。
お元気そうです何よりですU^ｪ^U
相変わらず美味しそうな料理ですねっ
夕飯の参考にさせて頂きますヽ(=´▽`=)ﾉ
always fantastic to see a new video. please keep them coming :)
So good to see you again Chef.  I love your videos.
美味しそう！！
美味しそう！！
I'm glad I'm eating dinner right now. I would not have been able to get through the night if I watched this later tonight.
Francis have a happy time in heaven hope you get delicious food and have a great time.  We miss you here😢
しめには、うどんかご飯しか入れたことなかった。ラーメンも美味しそう（●＾o＾●）
I miss Francis very much. Been a fan for a very long time and learned about Japanese food. I'm glad you're back chef 😊
美味しそう〜♡
Oh it looks delicious! I'll have to try this one out!
Nabe season is my favorite time of year~  Thank you Chef!
Cuestión, the noodles part, I can do it with udon noodes too?
Long time no see. Happy 2018 chef!
2in 1 dishes nice😍😍😍
I've been watching a lot of Grand Sumo Highlights from Robert Mensing's Youtube channel, and I must say, as a westerner, I always thought Sumo was just two fat men slamming their bellies into each other. But as I watched, I saw such deep strategy, skill, and athleticism(even speed!). I was hooked. I spent 8 hours watching only Sumo. I saw every Basho of 2017, and now I am watching the current January 2018 Basho highlights. So you can imagine how perfect the timing of this Chankonabe recipe is for me... I can't wait to cook this Chanko once I get the ingredients from the Japanese grocery store. Thank you so much for posting this delicious looking recipe!
It's so hard to watch without Francis in scene...
If the spirit of Francis took over that cute apron to live on for us, that's ok with me.
Francis!😭😭😭
Made this dish for dinner tonight and it was delicious!  Your recipes are always easy to follow with simple ingredients and equipment.  Thank you for sharing!
I am sure Hakuho would luv yours the best :)
Thank you for the recipe Chef ❤️❤️❤️
SOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!
Chef is back!! I missed you so much
お鍋の後は定番の雑炊でしたが、ラーメンも美味しそう🌟ぜひ試してみたいです。
Great to see you again! Chef ^__^
Thank you Chef san. This Chanko nabe and Shio Butter Ramen look so so delish!!
おかえりなさいませ！今回も美味しそうですね〜。早速試してみます。

今度、良かったらお好み焼きをお願いします！
I am always so happy to see new videos from you! We have recently lost our four-legged family member... she looked just like Francis, so watching your videos makes me feel comforted somehow. There are no words for how much we get to love them ❤️
Also, udon noodles are my sister's favourites, so I can't wait for the new recipe ^^
please, anyone, know the Japanese background music
This looks so good! I will make this soon.  Thank you for still making videos, chef! I love hearing 'Good luck in the kitchen!" 😀
Yum!
I love your cooking!
おいしそう~
Well I don't miss Francis. His time has come, but food is what we all are here for. May he rest in peace, but his food legacy live on!
I´m so glad Chef keeps making videos I really love all the food she cooks!! As a fellow cook I send you all my love from El Salvador.
I was in Japan some days ago so it's super sweet and cool to see you all come back now <3 I am happy to see that everything is going well.
yayyyy
these videos make me cry so much
OMG THE MOUTH IS MOVING AHHHHHHHHHH
Ohayo Chef-san! I learned to make mochi coated with sesame seeds from you. I was wondering if you can also teach how to make different fillings for the mochi? I only knew red bean and purple yam filling. Please Chef-san if it's okay? 🙌🙇
wb 2018 :>
so excited for the next episode too!! I really need to try these dishes <3
I thought sumo wrestler did not eat 4 legged animal (including pork) coz it brings bad luck on the ring?
Definitely gonna try the recipe though, thanks :)
Cooking is just isnt the same without you and Francis. Waiting for your next video!!!!
I thoroughly enjoy this recipe
delicious looking recipe.  sometimes i have trouble finding my mouth too!
ohhh francis we all miss you :(
Ty for posting more videos
OISHII SOU^^
寒い日はこんな鍋で温まりたいな～(*´-`)
This looks soo good. :D
This is the first vid I've seen in a long while. I was wondering also where is the doggy (Francis) and went to the comment section. Sad. :(
Chef! I missed you!!!
Watashi dai suki video🇧🇷🇯🇵

Sashiburi dane
I love you, Chef!  :*
Minna, let's get fat together!
I’m very happy to see your new videos :) and I love seeing you have Francis on your apron and on the little seat ❤️🐶😇🙏 much love from Chicago
Wait is Francis on the apron talking? That’s adorable
So much better than buying and playing cooking mama
Shouldn't the talking animation be on the plushie francis? A talking apron is a little creepy...
Looking good Chef    :)
Hmmm..... interesting
💖💖💖💖💖
I like with your cooking
hello friends; is there a sumo tournament next month?
Love to see this work !!!

Butter with ramen? Interesting!
I miss the RL Francis but i love that he is not forgotten and that theres a bit of animation to his toony self
Her apron was talking...
omg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYRcLr_xsfA&t=1m39s
It seems a taste dish!
Welcome back! 😍👍
What happened to the dog? Last time I checked this channel was I think 6 years ago.
Amazing
Muchas gracias
Hoi
Hotpot💕 tempted to make this for this year's lunar new year reunion dinner!😋
It must be hard for her to be surrounded by things that remind her of Francis when he’s gone 😭
Francis?  Francis is dead?
Chef puts food in her mouth and it falls out at the end!  I love Chef ^^
chinese version of enlgish  wowwww
Love you
En español por favor !
Used to watch the channel a lot some time ago.... came back recently, learned of Francis' passing, felt a sadness that surprised me. Going to re-familiarise myself with this wonderful channel.
Is there a brand or example of the Chinese-style chicken stock mentioned in the ingredients?  I've got an Asian market not far away that might carry it, but all I can find via google is Lee Kum Kee brand chicken bouillon, and that looks like just regular old chicken bouillon.
What is sake I can’t make a lot of recipes because of that, I don’t know where or how to find it.
I dont consume sake. any replacement?
Rest In Peace puppy dog 🐶
Did anyone else notice the dog on her shirt started moving its mouth at 1:40
Thank you so much. This is going to be a great recipe for my after workout meal ! 
Please keep on going, you got a lovely youtube channel.
What happened to the dog? 😔
En español  por favor?
おいしそう.  いつもありがとう
Cooking without dog. Q_Q
animated francis kinda creeps me a bit lmao cute but weird
Get new Francis please
you guys need to buy another puppy, and add it to the logo so it doesnt "replace" francis
COOKING WITHOUT THE DOG XDDDDDD CHANGE CHANNEL NAME PLS XDDD
:'( its not the same without Francis :'(
bah came here looking on a recipe on how to cook dogs. anyone know any? also what is the best age to eat? I am guessing a cage raised puppy would be the best meat?
Are they in the works of finding another dog?
look delicious,, what is your adress? :)
Time to get another dog!
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year💗🐩👩‍🍳 We could make new videos in 2017 because you continue supporting our channel. Can’t thank you enough. Hope all of you will enjoy a great holiday and have a great 2018!
Woah, the apron talks, took me awhile to notice.
I have been watching you and Francis for like 9 years :) Your food still always look amazing, you are so beautiful and happy. I'm sure that Francis would be so happy up there too !
I just realized Francis is still narrating when he's on chef's apron! #mindblown
I just noticed the drawings of Francis talking!! 😭😭😭 my heart!! 😭💖💕
I miss Francis, this video broke my heart reminding me that he isn't here. Chef I'm glad that you are doing well and cooking. I hope you will get another pup that could use a good home, and maybe also likes to cook.
So lovely, thank you for sharing. 

Missing dog, but happy to see you are still sharing wonderful recipes with us- Francis would be happy i think
Just like Bochia used to make!! That’s my Ukrainian grandmother!! She passed years ago at the age of 96!! She was an amazing cook!! I miss her and her cooking !!
I don't really care for cabbage, but this recipe looks GOOD.  Thanks, Chef.
In my country this recipe is usually made with pickled cabbage. The traditional food of Eastern Europe.
did anyone notice Francis talking from the chef's apron 😢
Stuffed cabbage is a traditional Christmastime Polish recipe, too. Martha Stewart makes them this time of year. RIP Francis and "Big Martha." Merry Christmas!
We all love you Chef! Love the drawing too!
that is christmas traditional food in my country Romania, and in balkans and is called sarma or  in my country is called sarmale, i don't like cabbage , i prefer the sarma covered in pickled grape leaves, is yumm, we put just 1 leaf of sauerkraut or grape leaf on a sarma and no toothpicks, romanian ladies have a method of packing that stay and not unfold, and we put on  them on plate yoghurt or  sourcream, you must try that
日本人の人いますか？　　　美味しそう
I'm soo proud!!! 0 dislikes😲
The drawing is so adorable😢
Eastern Europe's choice of food for any holiday  :D
Polish "Gołąbki" !!! <3
That is the cutest thing i ever seen the dog on her apron is talking. I just adore that awesomeeeee ! :)
How is it possible she's getting more beautiful in each episode.
Another delicious recipe, Chef. I hope to try this one day.
I wish you well, Chef 🙏🏾🙏🏾 amazing recipe as always! I'll definitely try this, it looks so good!!
О, это же голубцы! <3
なぜ17枚？って思ったら、落し蓋だったのですね(＾◇＾)
all these years I have been struggling with getting the cabbage leaves off whole...and in comes chef and shows us how to really do it! We love you chef!
Great recipe! Great timing!
Thank you, Chef!  These will be delicious.
Still missing Francis but love Chef's videos.  So happy you're still going on.
Love cabbage rolls. This recipe looks so good with the bacon pieces added in the slow cooker. Thank you Chef & Francis! Good luck in the kitchen!
I am so happy to see/watch you again. 💗
TÖLTÖTTKÁPOSZTA 😮😮 ugyanitt, alig használt bojler eladó
Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I hope you have a Merry Christmas
Happy Holidays, team Cooking With Dog! 🌲☃️❄️
Looks very tasty I should try it sometimes 💗(づ￣ ³￣)づ
I love this channel 😭💕
Thank you for continuing to show us wonderful Japanese recipes Chef!
Cabbage rolls are great with rice! All the juice is tasty, so it's good not to waste it if you can :)
Christmas Joy! So excited to get a new video from Chef and Francis.
Ooooh yummy.  This I should try! Another great recipe from chef! Thank you! 😀
Thank u for this awesome recipe. You are one of the best cook in YouTube.
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one for Teishoku pleeeease...I'm a long time subscriber of your channel. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲
I prefer my cabbage rolls with some rice and parsley in the meat mixture. ロールキャベツにはお米とパセリが入った方が味が良いと思うのですがどうでしょうか。
I've never used a slow cooker to make this but that sounds so much easier. Will have to try it.
I've neglected to drop by for a while.  Thanks for the animated Francis.  Chef-sama looks great and always does her best with that indomitable smile and determination!
Hi darling,  where is rice ? 
That's something new 🤔
Thanks for making the video, chef! It's really amazing.

Cabbage cabbage ca-bba-ge...

I‘m sorry..
Francis R.I.P.! Thanks for your inspiration in cooking!
Another great making me hungry video!
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!! Thank you for sharing your videos with us!
These look so freakin GOOD! I'm so glad you continue to bring us recipes, have a wonderful holiday and have a happy new year!
miss u so much :3
I tried this recipe this year and it was lovely! My rolls turned out rather small, but my roommates liked them being bite-sized
Can't wait to see what Chef has prepared for 2018! ^_^
Hallo, I used to watch this when I was younger. So many good recipes and I am very thankful for it. It's been at least 5 years since I was here and I am glad to found my way back for more delicious food. 
Thank you very much 💕😊
My condolences to you. I just found out about lovely Francis.
This is my favorite Polish dish! Thank you for making it! :D
aww, this reminds me of my childhood. my mother used to make this for us. thank you for the recipe! <3
I always have left over cabbage and never know what to do with it. This looks delicious!
I'll have to try this soon! Thanks, Chef and Francis! 💕
Where is the dog?? I miss him/her >3<
Happy new year chef! I miss Francis! T_T
Coincidence mum buy cabbage going try this recipe now 😉
Thank you chef for making this video
We make those in Poland too, but we use Rice instead of Panko.
They are called Gołąbki (Pigeons) here.
never seen a dog be so loved. honestly it made me want to cry to still see Francis still on the show and shown love. even gave francis more of a personality than before. goodjob! i love it!
Thank you for the video, I hope your holiday was a good one and I look forward to more content when you can upload it.
Such a beautiful smile !
ty for the videos
Love your videos. Merry Christmas and have a great 2018!

That familiar song at the end when Chef shows the finish product is so calming and nostalgic and comforting. Thank you for keeping it in the videos. Love Cooking with Dog ♥️
It looks like polish gołąbki <3
It's been a looooooong time since I've seen your videos. All are good except for the old ones, not because they are bad, the quality is sooooooooooooooo old, that's what I get for seeing old Vids, speaking of which I haven't seen you react to your old videos at all. So can you do that for the people who love you? That would be great.
this is romanian specific plate🥂sarmale
This looks delicious. She was very meticulous in her preparation!!
Cabbage rolls looks delicious (Oishīdesu ne).
Did this lady make hamburger with onion and ketchup once!!?! I loved that show!!
I can’t wait to try this recipe out in the future! Happy Holidays!
Looks delicious! Also the framed drawing was really cute!
What can i do if i don't have slowcooker?  :(
Always watching you from Hokkaido
Aaww that Picture 🐶❤👩
Happy new 2018 year ,arigato kurimas !!!
I made this today! I've been craving them since the video first popped into my subscriptions. Very tasty but separating the cabbage leaves was quite difficult, took me a while. I used white cabbage but next time I might use Savoy instead because those leaves spread easier. I imagine they might have a better colour too. And the cabbage came out so tender, the knife just fell through it. From chef to chef: lovely recipe as always, thank you so much! Definitely making again!
メルクリスマスと明けましておめでとうございます！  I cannot wait to try this recipe! ❤
Glad to hear from you again!
Thanks for the video! These are similar to Romanian Sarmale. Microwaving the cabbage is a great tip, as we'd painstakingly bleached the leaves traditionlly.
Nice concept for new season of CWD keep it up
Merry Christmas Chef and Angel Francis. Thank you for teaching us to make wonderful dishes and spread love through cooking.
Thank you Chef! It was a great christmas present to see this video!
Oh my goodness I am IN LOVE with the talking dog animation on the apron. THANK YOU! And thank you for the beautiful recipes. can't wait to try some :)
One of my husband's favorite dishes. He, however, would not be happy with the kind of skimpy amount of filling (as delicious as it looked) Thanks though for a lovely video, have been watching you for years.
Never before have I wanted so badly to stuff stuffed cabbage into my mouth. Looks so appetizing!
I've always wanted to make cabbage rolls. Maybe this time I'll definitely try it out.
Hungarian "Töltött káposzta" :)
Polish golombki :D
I love cabbage rolls, I never used a microwave to soften the cabbage before, what a great idea, I've always boiled it in a big pot. The microwave seems so much easier. I cant wait to try the recipe. Thanks.
CHEFS SHIRT IS TALKING!!! XD ; RIP FRANCIS ; we just had a furry friend die, but he will be fondly remembered ; wishing you and yours the best =]
Please make siaumay tutorial or any dimsums tutorial
We miss you, Francis! We love you!
This looks awesome. Thanks as always chef.
Oh and thank you for the recipes! I learn a lot and they relax me :)
Gołąbki :D
It's polish gołąbki! :O
It reminds me a lot to a dish my mom cooked me: she's Italian : )
CHOU FARCI!
Stuffed cabbage is a favorite of my family! If I don't have much time to cook the proper rolls, I chop the cabbage and brown the ground meat before adding everything in the recipe to the crockpot to cook slow all day. It's not as pretty as the individual rolls but very easy and tasty! Try it with a teaspoon of smoked paprika for a complex flavor!

Thank you cooking with dog! They look so yumm~
This looks so yummy!! I envy you for getting to eat it right now, haha.
Any substitute for a slow cooker?
I cried a little while watching this. It is so sweet. I'm really glad that you two are still making these videos with Francis's spirit kept alive. The The graphics are so neat! When I noticed Francis talking on Chef's apron, I got excited like a small child. Thank you! 
Also, please let Chef know that this hairdo mass her looks so young. :) Very cute and stylish.
Chef is best waifu 😎
OMG I only noticed that Francis on Chef's apron talks halfway into the video!
I love cabbage rolls and have made them many times. I've never heard of microwaving the cabbage though. I've always steamed it. The microwave looks so much easier. Can't wait to try your recipe.
Looks so good, but don't want to make so much!! Thank you!
Very nice recipe. Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
DAMN THATS A HUGE CABBAGE D: the cabbage in my store isnt even 500g 😂😂 i need 3 Austrian cabbages to get 1 Japanese  xD
We have a similar Arabic dish to the one that you made in the video 😍❤️❤️❤️I have been looking for a recipe on YouTube to try and make it myself ☺️💗💗💗and now I have found the recipe that I will try 😘 thank you for sharing the recipe ❤️❤️❤️
Yay! Chef's back.
I DO like Button:) !!
6:15 made me so happy 😄
missing to Francis <3
I’d love to make it!!! Thx & a beautiful hi to Francis, whereverhes now.😺
The dog on the apron also talks!!!!! Never realize that before!
I love the talking Francis!
Because of the cabbage and how it looks in the end, it reminds me of kimchi ^^
I just literally started watching this channel last night, saw the video I'm watching was from 2008 and wondered if Francis was still alive.... Now I know, and oddly enough I miss him so much already...
YOU'RE BACK! 😍
That haircut ☆ that kitchen ♡
This channel makes me happy. :)
I suggest hiring a new dog and cooking him. Thank you
In my country, Montenegro, there is a similar dish called Sarma!! This is very interesting to see! Thank you!
これわ、見て、ロールキャベツわ、たべたくなりました。レンジお、つかうと、いいだね。
絶対美味しい！！ 100万回再生いくべき！
I love the animated Francis.
Francis parle ! <3
This is almost identical to the recipe my mother use to make for our family all the time. We called it Pig in a Blanket though. I drooled for most of the video....
Just like Polish golumpki!
I’m making this for the new year! Thank you Francis and Chef for making it easy to follow!
Sorry ,it is my first watching you after many  many years...
what happened to  Francis? Dead? :(((
We call that in Turkey 'Etli Lahana Sarma'  to eat warm
and the cold version is 'Zeytinyağlı Lahana Sarma' no meat in it...
sarma <3
Looking for something good to watch so very happy you are back and the cabbage rolls look amazing reminds me as a young cook when I cooked at a Czech Restaurant in Seattle they made cabbage rolls usually stuffed with rice and meat mixture and tomato sauce too !  Wishing you and yours the best for 2018 !  I know dear Francis is smiling from Heaven !  You are an awesome and humble Chef !  Thanks for sharing your talent !  Corie in Seattle
Francis or no Francis, your videos are very relaxing and the food looks so delicious.
Awww I love the little tribute to Francis. We will miss him.
I like seeing Francis’ mouth moving when he’s talking.
So glad Chef looks happy and cheery in this video, it's nice to see she is doing well! The cabbage rolls look delicious mmmm =D
Looks like Polish Gołąbki.
aww this is so sweet
Sarma!!!
Merry christmas chef!!
Deliciosos!!
Felices Fiestas!
Abrazos
Im gonna make a vegan version.
It's been so long since I watched any of these videos and as such I'm out of the know big time, but to see Francis everywhere here, about halfway in I noticed the apron, I almost started crying. That's so cute and clever! It's a wonderful tribute to him.
OMG!!! Its so cool how they made Francis talk on Chef's apron and on the corner!!! :D
For some reason, I really like Chef's glove. It's so long and extends past the wrist. Where can I get these?
You have made this cabbage roll video in healty version with tofu,  please dont put it down, i like dat recipe too coz i cant eat too much meat 😯
Por favor traducirlo al español!
Cabbage rolls are one of my favorites food
Awww el perrito en su gabacha tambien habla... 😖😖 Francis!!!
Great work, I'll try.
These look so delicious! <3
That looks so delicious! I need to try this
Isn't this based off of a Polish recipe?! I've always loved these, but I think the Polish version is made with vinegar brine, or fermented.
Welcome back Chef!
wheres dog!!
i miss u so much !!!!
Hello, how are you? Merry Christmas. Thank you for all of the videos. I hope you will know a dish I ate in Japan many years ago. My home stay mama called it nasubi den gaku or Yakima nasubi but it was not the same as I have seen, it was much better. She cooked the nasu in a broth for a long time until they were soft. I think it has a different name. This was in Osaka. Maybe you know the name of this nasu dish?

Again, thank you for the videos.
Ура, Голубцы)))))))))))
I would like to make this! Can i ask what kind of tomato sauce did you use? Is there a special type or brand? Thank you!
What a great recipe! It looks so delicious as usual! I LOVE the new setting where animated Francis is sharing the recipe with us. Make him a little bigger, please ^_^ and leave him there on the corner even when filming chef. It's sort of confusing to go back and forth between the animated Francis and Chef's apron Francis xD. I love the little picture of Chef and Francis too.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to Cooking with Dog team and Chef!!
This are a very popular Romanian food "Sarmale"
This makes me remember when i made my first cabbage rolls with my cochome, it was delicious. i miss my cochome...
Cooking Mama style!
I will make this asap
<3
Looks so good!
There's a talking dog on the apron! There's a talking dog on the apron!
maybe ill find a metal drop lid some day
my mother in law use to make these. there very good
the moment you notice the dog on her apron is talking to you.....
I don't like cabbage but this looks delicious
I miss Frances.
I miss you Frances
Theo dõi kênh này bao nhiêu lâu mới thấy có sub :))))
Cảm ơn bạn làm vietsub nhé
Hello and Happy New Year!! I love your channel. :) I would like to make a request. Can you teach us how to make homemade natto??
Can you use something other than cabbage?
yuuummmmmmmmm!!!!
Yummy!!! 😋
Aww...
WHAT HAPPEND TO FRANCIS THE REAL DOG?
My favorite cabbage dish!
Huh, is the stuffed cabbage supposed to cook on high or low heat?
This is originally a Polish dish.  I'm surprised it made it to Japan.  This makes me happy as a Polish person.
Сармите не се правят с прясно зеле, а с кисело зеле, кайма и ориз.
That's one comfort dish!
I love these videos.
That was one weird looking microwave.
Aw, look at the little cute animated Francis head in the corner. Yall might as well start fully animating him in the videos. For example, Like Space Jam. Not that an animation can easily replace Francis.
Cabbagee ;) This looks so yummy!! Happy Holidays!
Looks 🤤
sdsdessrt5
I Love this!
This is so cute
sarmale <3
Looks yummy!! Merry Christmas!!
At the beginning I saw the dog on the apron winking, thought I was imagining it but it really did move :o
cooking mama anyone?
Delicious looking!!!!
Francis! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
another nice recipe from chef, who is looking very well indeed.  merry christmas!
did the dog take host of the apron
The talking apron will take some time to get use to
She looks lovely <3
We miss Francis.
I remember watching this about 7-8 years ago the first video I ever watch is how to make nikkuman I remember watching it as a kid now I am all grown up time flies
I love this !
Merci Chef ; )
we sarmale now
instead of just hot water, can i use stock since you put in the bouillon cube later
Missing Francis.. 😢😢😢
Lovely animation!
Chef, can you replace extra firm tofu for the meat in this recipe? Or do you have a tofu cabbage roll recipe?
Sarmale!!!
вау голубчики
So trying this
It's traditional meal of my country! We call them "balandėliai" which means something like "little doves" or "little pigeons" - we don't have a distinction.
love the show, but how come you guys don't call the show "cooking with francis", "cooking with dog" sounds like your cooking the dog. I'm just saying the title misinterprets things.
who mixes pork n beef?
голубцы фигачит
where is dog 😱
Hey! New cwd video ! Yey !
Enjoy the meal chef!
Oishi ♥
japan style western dish are the best
Its brand new chou farci!!
Miss you Francis!
Looks yummy!
It looks like a green brain
Thank you! Cabbage rolls ("gołąbki") are one of my country's national dishes and they're oh so delicious! I especially enjoy the version made with the crinkled cabbage variety - and with raw rice mixed in the meat filling. And what Polish cooks always do is put a few cabbage leafs on the bottom of the pot, so that the rolls don't burn. Oh, and we don't use the toothpicks, the rolls keep their shape anyway :)
I love cooking with the dog , I cook with my dog too but she does not talk , she only eats LOL....!!!
Yummy
Is it safe to microwave plastic wrap?
I cannot find a cabbage so big! I tried and all I could find was one half the size. I'm currently microwaving it and hoping to be able to roll them with smaller leaves
Im really happy Francis is still the mascot and host of the show even though he is no longer with us physically; the animation and stuffed toy version of him is really cute and it's nice he's not forgotten!
But where is francis
Delicious
Microwaving plastic wrap is really unhealthy, leaks a buttload of nasty chemicals like BPA into your food :( Don't do it!
Да это ж Голубцы!
Hi, could you tell me what oven you use for your dishes? Thank you 😄
We make this dish often in my house :D but it's called "gołąbki" here, the literal translation would be "pidgeons" it's funny but I guess it's because of their size, we don't make them with pidgeons or anything xD
This looks so tasty but why the hell am I watching this? I have stomach flu 😷
Like the new episodes and this channel so much! 

some constructive criticism:

I was not a fan of the new music, I think the old music is better. The music was a bit distracting. 

Also, can you put the Francis animation on the left side? I think it would also be less distracting that way. Great job nonetheless.
Plastic  in the microwave? Isn't that cancerous?
Translate yout videos to Arabic.
Great recipe, but isn't it unsafe to microwave plastic wrap?
The japanese dialect makes me uncomfortable
Francis surely sniffs the delicious dish from up there, playing happily in snow! Thank you Chef for this recipe and Merry Christmas to you!
Also known as "sarmale" 🎄💖
It's a Japanese twist on cannelloni
That looks very good. You know Chef, I am an old man and have had many dogs pass away, it is always a very sad time, but I have found the best cure for the pain is a new dog. We will never forget the ones who came before, but a new dog takes a lot of the pain away as you will start to love it too. Thanks for the video.
Sick.. you lost me at wrapping cabbage in plastic and then microwaving.
Who is this man speaking stupid japanese accent english?
I lost it at the talking apron. There is a lot of effort to incorporate Francis in the videos. Thank you. Appreciate it a lot.
Thank goodness you still upload.  I remember doing my English homework and watching you when I was 13.  Now I'm 22 and cooking for my girlfriend and expanding my cooking horizons.  Thanks for the amazing memories.
I was freaked for a moment I thought you were replacing Francis. Then I realize it's just an old clip 😂 
I miss Francis...
i hope that everyone is doing well, I'm really happy to see you again chef and just as i expected, this video is just as good as your usual videos and the food looks amazing. I love you and this great channel
Nice to see chef doing so good!!my dog past away this month and he was around 15 years old too,like Francis.I hope my dog will see Francis in dog heaven and they will play with each other happily.Can chef teach us some old fashioned Japanese cuisine? Thank you;)
We miss you chef!!!! You’re back ☺️
4:07 - Hearing him say "pizza cheese" is probably going to be the best part of my day.
Great dish. Sad not seeing Francis.
I still have nightmares about counting how many times Francis blinks.
Without doggo, it’s just cooking mama
Dakgalbi is my absolute favorite Korean dish ever. I've used the recipe from Martina's Midnight Munchies but this one is intriguing as well.

Bottom line is: YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS DISH; IT'S AMAZING.
You guys should do a tour of the set or a behind the scenes video!
Glad to see you back chef. Heres hoping you have another epic recipe for this coming Christmas
Thank you, this is perfect timing for me! I've been looking for a recipe to do with korean rice cakes which isn't tteokbokki! \(^__^)/ I'm so glad you keep uploading: we all miss Francis sadly, but Chef is the talent after all! When I see Chef smile, I can't help but smile along with her. Thank you for all the smiles and delicious food!
シェフ、少しお元気になられたようで、よかったです。これからもレシピ楽しみにしてます。
Korean and Japanese cuisines are my favourite, I'm excited to see this Korean fusion recipe on Cooking with dog 😊
Chef, too impatient to taste!  Don't forget to lightly blow since the cheese is very hot!  Haha!

Thank you Heaven Francis, another dish for you!
♥︎♥︎I’m glad chef is back, I’m a huge fan and I was worry the channel would be over, we miss you Francis ♥︎♥︎
Francis won't mind if you get a new pal for the show. He would be very happy for any of his buddies to be with you.
I wonder what Maangchi would think of this video :)
that intro made me cry..
I really miss Francis but I am glad that Chef is acutally doing fine and I am happy for her doing so  <3
Thank you for all your hard work and effort, Chef and Francis! These videos are a ray of sunshine in a gray world!
This is one of the nicest comment section I've seen recently
I thank you for continuing the chain despite the absence of Francis. I follow you from the beginning and watch your videos give the smile. And I always have a thought for him
I'm hungry
We missed you Chef! ❤
I Always Love That Grandpa Voice Even Sometime i Don't Understand What he Said 😂😂
Aww...I can still listen to Francis! And I can still watch Chef! Thank you!💚
ํYeah!!! Chef has comeback !!!!
待ってました〜♡
お元気そうで何よりです((´艸｀*))
I love your show.  I'm glad Francis lives on in our hearts.  Your recipies are delicious and easy to follow.  Thank you for continuing the show.
I'm not normally a person who gets upset by a celebrity death, but I cried during this video. It does look delicious.
Hi chef! I translated the video and description, have a nice day!
we love you, Chef!
コメントありがとうございます。 犬がいなくてさみしそうですか？ (Q2)
Chef is so adorable. I'm glad she's doing well
Hi chef, I am from Mexico.  I really enjoy watching your videos.  I have a request, could  you please tell us how to prepare a sesame dressing.  Thank you for sharing your recipes.
This is the most blessed channel on youtube, Francis is in heaven and will always live in our heart ❤️
맛있어보여요 ^^
that's cool how you bring Francis in more, and I was wondering where you got those metal trays they are like perfect for working and I found them, great sizes, I love watching you, it teaches me many things about cooking
I'll always love u chef and Francis :,)
I'm so happy to see you back
Missing Francis, still very happy to have seen you upload. My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during this hard time. Take your time to heal, I will still be here
Good to see you are doing well, Chef! Thank you for another great recipe!
Chef!!! I'm happy to see more videos of you again!!! I hope that you're well, and i want to send you hugs and my best wishes in this christmas days!!!
God bless you guys, thank you for the great recipe videos ☺️🙏🏼❤️
Aww, Francis will be missed ;_;
Is Dakgalbi popular in Japan? That's surprising! I thought Japanese might not prefer it because it is quite spicy... Glad Japanese to enjoy this food 😀
The talking Francis icon is actually a great idea. ^_^ His spirit shall live on!
I’m so happy to see y’all back and making videos while still honoring the memory of Francis. Can’t wait to see the next video!
レシピが観れて嬉しいです。
Who are those 6 heartless hooman T-T
Welcome back Chef, Domo Arigato for your clips!!!

Finally!! I've been waiting you.😊😊
お餅がいいね~（●＾o＾●）
I didn't notice the dog in the apron was also moving
Chef, you always look radiant and amazing! It must be your delicious-looking dishes. I hope I can find some of these ingredients, I have to try this one. c:
So happy to see make more videos! This is as awesome as the videos with Francis! In eternal memory: Francis! (*˘︶˘*).｡.:*♡
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one for Teishoku pleeeease...I'm a long time subscriber of your channel. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲
Add some curry powder to dakgalbi sauce!! That would make dakgalbi taste much more like original Chuncheon dakgalbi :)
あなたの喪失には申し訳ありません。これらの動画を作ってあなたの愛を広げていただきありがとうございます。私は日本語を書くことができないので、私はGoogle翻訳を使用していますが、あなたの努力にとても感謝しています。
あなたはすばらしいシェフであり、あなたのチャンネルは素晴らしいです。

I'm sorry for your loss and thank you for making these videos and spreading your love. I can't write Japanese so I'm using google translate but I want you to know I am very thankful for your effort. You are an amazing chef and your channel is excellent.
liked before watching. ^^
Hola!
Gusto en saludarte!
Formidable!
Saludos desde México Maravilloso, Mágico
thank you for always sharing your recipes!
I love your videos. You teach me a lot. Hope you get well soon. Relax and happy ! :D
I appreciate the talking apron, thank you for this talkin apron 🙏🏽✨
To see you guys uploading more frequently makes me really happy.
Francis became an iPhone X animoji aaaaah💞💕
Francis is narrating from heaven omg
Has anyone else noticed that the picture of Francis on chef's apron is animated? He's talking, it's so cool.
I was wondering how the show would go on (IF it even would!), without our dear Francis :( but this is perfect, chef, thank you
Tan pronto sane mi estomgo preparare esto! Se ve deliciosooo, gracias chef!! <3
まってどうしてフランシス！？と思ったら過去の映像か…😢
お元気そうで何よりです！
Omg I missed you so much !

So glad you're back !
待ってました...！
とっても美味しそうです(｀・ω・´)
Well.. It's missing chili flakes :( But I understand it's hard to find it in Japan!
This channel always make me hungry and happy with the voice over of Francis :)
I love this so much!! So glad to see that Chef is doing well:) 💞
エプロンのフランシス喋ってるのすごい！
I am happy watching your videos again. I have been watching u since I was in high school. I just recently graduated college and still never stopped watching your videos as I do my work.
Hong Kong🙋‍♂️Chief !You’re back !😍
Thank you for all the amazing recipes ❤️❤️❤️❤️will definitely try it 😍❤️❤️❤️
Wow only now I noticed that Francis moves his mouth on chef's apron as well!
What a wonderful recipe! Thank you chef 😄🙏🏼
Francis would love this even he is gone.
Made this today. I was unable to find garlic chives for the dish, but was still very tasty. The mochi and cheese really help to balance the spicy sauce. I had it with rice also and it was really good. Thank you!
Came here from thaiboy goon. 
w
Very little brings me more joy than seeing a new video from Cooking With Dog! 💖 I was sad today but now I'm happy. Thank you Chef!
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
i just noticed the logo talking 
I miss francis :(
Love the recipe.  Are you guys going to do osechi soon in preparation for New Years?
Cooking with dog, can you make Japanese onion bread please.
美味しい!
In time hopefully we'll get to see another puppy :) thank you for continuing to upload videos.
4:45 When you burn your mouth on the cheese but need to soldier through for the video :p

Also, that painting in the background is adorable.
I love you. thanks for uploading again. been a while. been ur subs since like, forever
It looks pretty good. Thanks for the recipe, CWD!
Anyone know how spicy this is, because it looks really delicious /cries at weakness/
Chef is aging beautifully :)
Wow she is like my second mom! She invented being cool!!
AAAAHHHHH FRANCIS WHEN HE WAS YOUNG! I miss him....
Thank you so much you don't replace Francis with another dog to make this show continue.. I'm happy you replace with dog's doll to remind us about how well behave Francis is!! Cheer up for cooking with dog's staff!!
Many thx for cooking Korean dish!
It is fun to see you post again, and you always have such great recipes.  We do miss Francis, too.
Well I don't have mochi here, (next time I'll order or make some), but anyway, I just made this and it was so tasty!! My belly is full and happy!! Thank you for another awesome recipe!!! 😘
Love you, Chef!  And Anime-Francis is so good!  This recipe looks delicious, I really love Korean food.
Interesting recipe!  I would like to try it.
와! 너무 맛나겠다요~!
THIS IS AWESOME. GOOD JOB!!!!
Glad to see you back, Francis is very well incorporated! I love seeing your videos!
OMG A KOREAN DISH MADE BY YOU...LOOKS DELICIOUS😍
I'll have to try this without the cheese.  I can't have dairy but I think even without it this will be fantastic.  Good to see you Chef!
美味しそう！(*´Д｀*)
画面の向こう側からいい匂いがします♪(*´꒳`*)
"チーズタッカルビ"辛そうで冬にはピッタリのレシピですね！
冬はお鍋って感じでしたが、チーズタッカルビ作ってみようと思います！レシピをありがとうございます！(*´꒳`*)
So happy to see your video!  Chef you look amazing as ever!!  Well done!
thank you chef for another great meal !!!
When I see Francis in the beginning....my heart hurts so much and I started burst into tears because I think this was the last video they filmed but no....I hope you will live a happy long life, obachan😭😭😭
i was watching your old videos and i remember how i used to dream about having my own cooking show. and now seeing this without francis made my heart sank.
chef is looking more pretty everyday!
thank you for still making videos!!!!!
shouldnt have watched this late at night😭😭😭😭😭
Happy to see you again!! :)
Quisiera saber porqué no está el perrito...
I would like to know why the puppy is not ...
DO MORE KOREAN RECIPES PLEASE! Japanese and Korean are my favourite foods. Also very happy to see more videos from this channel! welcome back <3
Love your videos. Animation takes me out of it, but I'm in the vast minority. Everything looks so addictively good though.
Yummy looks so good !!! So glad to see you back hope your weekend is going good ♡c:!
Felicitaciones Chef, que lindo detalle de colocar un recuerdo de Francis 🐩
At the intro, I thought that Francis has come back from the dead O.O" Well, I'm happy that Chef is still enjoying cooking and making recipes, also that she's still well in shape 😊
What an unexpected combination of flavors! It looks wonderful and super tasty! Thanks for the recipe.
I guess I need to grow more just shiso next year...
This is one of my favorite dishes!!
Maangchi does a really good video of this recipe as well. I would highly recommend it.
my heart... this is too cute :')
Anyone else camparing this version to Martina's version from midnight munchies! (In a good way of course! 😁)
I miss Korean food so much!
The talking Francis is so darn cute and cool! How did u guys animate it so well?! I LOVE ITTTTT♡♡♡
Glad to see you again Chef !
Thank you, Chef! We love and adore your videos.
Good to see you back on the show chef!
i love all the memorials for francis! i miss him!
Awe....I miss seeing how well behaved Francis was. May he RIP.
I prefer the original Korean version since Japanese is too sweet and almost non-spicy for my taste...
rip francis!!!
It looks so delicious 😍❤️❤️❤️
i cry watching every video
It all looks so yummy chef, thank you!
Looks delicious chef!!
Hope you're doing well Chef
i smile and cry inside with francis on the apron now
francis is so cute in the corner and in the appron too :)
I miss this :'D
I want to cook Korean at home
My son would love this less spicy version of Cheese Dakgalbi. Cheese truly adds magic to many dishes. 

I'm so happy how Francis is always part of the videos. He's in doggy heaven now but will never ever be forgotten. 😄❤
I just lost my first dog two weeks ago and I didn't think it would ever get better. Watching this now reminds me that you will never forget the special place your furry friends have in your heart, but you can still go on. Thank you for always doing your best Chef!
Nice to see you again, Chef.
Precisamente pensé en fideos para ese guiso
I miss Francis. It hurts too much that he's not there. Rest in peace.
I agree with you Francis,it looks sooooo delicious !
고춧가루랑,카레가루넣으면 더 좋을것같아요 ㅎㅎ
It's not quite the same without ol' Francis ):
Oishi sou^^
👍😊👍 súper!!
I hope chef gets a new co star and names him Franco
yummy!  I like Korea foods.
Welcome Back! We Missed You!!! (and the food).....
the apron is talking :')
Yay Francis :D
its not the same without francis
Was the Francis aprin always talking? Why did I notice this only now?
I love this channel.
I am glad you put the picture intead of the stuffed toy dog in francis's spot. putting a toy instead of francis didn't go down too well with me. it felt like you were suggesting that a toy dog can replace a real dog, something parents often try to convince their kids about.
CHEEEEESE!!!

Looks delicious!
HAHA I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm super into these videos.
can't wait to try this
韓国味噌もいいけど、日本の赤味噌で焼酎と一緒に付け焼きにして七味を振って、一杯やるのもいいですな。
I needed this.
Please create a cookbook so I can buy it.
By "pizza cheese," do you mean mozzarella?
after so many days
What's a centimeter?
wait, her dog died?!! WHAAAT
Francis will is still with us.
mmmmmm .... =^ u^=
😢I miss Francis !!! wahhhhh!!!!😭
<3
That looked so yummy!
Hi chef, I'm very happy to see a Korean recipe on your channel. Dakgalbi is one of my favorite too. hehe Thanks for introducing Korean food to people. :)
What about the picture of Francis and Chef. Where did it come from?
Francis 😭
Today I found that Francis is not longer with us...
Thank you.
Careful chef, u almost burnt yourself. :)
Dear old Francis. I thought he was in this episode at the beginning. So sad to know he won't be in the videos anymore, but with the ones you already have - Francis will live forever :(
Where is the dog? TvT
i love it!
We love you!
Baby Francis is talking!!!
Where is d DOG!????
I'm so glad the channel is still going, we all miss Francis very much
I love all your cute kitchen tools
she is the dopest.
That looks sooo good...
Can I use ketchup instead of gochujang?
Where is Francis :'( ?
nyummm
I can just smell the food through my screen, haha
한국에서 콩나물이랑 부추는 안올리는뎅
Rest in Peace Francis
She straight destroyed her mouth at 4:44  good bye flavor
chef reminds me of mom character in cooking mama the game
Mouthwatering
PAINTING SO CUTE!
I want to try that
嬉しい😳
Sugoi
😍
Oh Francis, you will be in my heart forever.
I really hope you're both staying strong and keeping yourselves happy. I know Francis would love that.
Yum!
:)
💕
It looks good but that is definitely the palest dakgalbi I have ever seen hahaha. I think this recipe it good for those who can't handle the regular spiciness of most Korean food but still want the same kind of taste.
Gochujang is so delicious! I've made fire chicken with cheese but I haven't done it like this with all the vegetables. Looks amazing! (Love the little talking Francis, too!)
mmmm.   looks so good.  good to see you chef!
Please don't ever leave youtube. I love your recipes and your demeanor so much! I low key wish you were my mom lol XD Maybe you need a 2nd dog for your show? Maybe Francoise?
I really shouldn't watch these when I'm hungry and don't have a lot in the kitchen, nowhere near enough to make something this good anyways.
日本から応援してます、豪快マスクと申します。いつも楽しく拝見しております。僕も料理好きなんで美味しさがすごく伝わるいい動画だとわかります。因みに僕も犬飼ってた時期ありました。そろそろ年越し蕎麦の時期ですね(o・ω・o)
日本で人気だなんて嘘です！聞いたこと無い
RIP Francis
where is your Francis the dog ?
Wow!!!!!
Francis! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Where is dog
pleaaaaase how make a video how to make homade kirimochi pleaaaaaaase chef
you are going to make cabbage rolls? hurrah! can't wait! traditional family dish! :-) :-D >_<
❤
Yummy! Thank you!
love
@cookingwithdog I wanted to know from where do you buy your bowls? This transparent bowl in which you marinaded the chicken where did you buy it from? Thank you!
Yummy!
Love the talking Francis cartoon!  And, this looks so yummy!
It's pitty that i can't cook it :/
닭갈비 먹고싶다 ㅜㅠ
犬はいないですか？それとも死んだですか？ (Q1)
으어 닭갈비 먹고 싶다
Where is the puppy?
Not to be nit-picky, but aren't those just red potatoes, not sweet potatoes?
It's just like a kimchee with chicken, mochi and grated cheese. Nice video
Francis is dead, yeah? Sad to hear but... he's totally dead, yes? :D
I hate korean food, but if chef makes it then i bet it's good. <3
PLEEEEEEAAAAASE just buy a new dog!
Francis talking on the apron is weird.
am i'm the only one that's feeling weird that the japanese is making a korean food?
Can you please get a new dog? ♥ Maybe it would be Francis' friend or long lost brother. lol
Shouldn't the channel be called "Cooking" now? You know, since the dog is not around anymore.
Francis will forever be a good boy
😞 I miss Francis,
I'm going to miss you Francis, even though I'm new in this channel. At least you have lived a satisfying 14 to nearly 15 years of dog years and that is pretty amazing. I wish you could've lived longer but I cannot ask for more because you already have gave us a lot of entertainment and joy. They say a dog is only a part of your life while you are in every moment of theirs.
I hope to finally meet Francis when it's my time to cross that Rainbow Bridge.  Meanwhile, my love for Francis lives in my heart.   Thank you, Chef, for sharing this joyous playtime with us.  Francis never fails to bring smiles & joy to everyone.
I cried so hard right now. I just came back from watching the green tea tiramisu video, and I barely noticed the little stuffed Francis plushie. I’ve been following this account for years. I’m heartbroken, but now Francis is in a better place. Seriously my favorite channel ever
Yes, Francis will be in out hearts forever. Thanks for this video. It was a such a beautiful moment for the chef and Francis. ❤️
Cooking with Dog isn't the same without Francis. ;-;

R.I.P Francis 
You'll be remembered!
The 47 dislikes from the video are people that disrespect  Francis are nothing but scoundrels. May Francis be rested by gods hands. And Francis cook will never be forgotten but taste. R.I.P FRANCIS
Thank you Francis. I found you during the time I lived abroad. My life was quite lonely and this channel and you gave me kinda joy. I tried many recipes from here during my dayoffs. Thank you. May your soul rest in peace.❤
God is one of Francis's biggest fan. He'd just wanted him to cook with him in heaven. ;___;
Today, Francis tries to teach chef to go around the obstacle.
フランシス君 永眠されたんですね。
ご冥福をお祈りします。虹の橋の向こうでママさんを待っててあげてね。
Francis is the goodest chef boi 🐕🐕 My Lulu will play with you in Doggie Heaven
Oh Francis... =< We miss you, little buddy.
I love u Francis
We will allways remember you Francis
ひさびさにこのチャンネルを思い出し見にきました。とても残念ですが、動画にも私たちの心の中にもずーっといると思って今後の動画と楽しみにしています☺️
Happy Times! My dog Cosmo is 11 years old and if I knew now he would live to be 14, I'd be so happy!
So much love to Francis!! Chef, you are in our hearts & minds. Thank you for sharing him with us
RIP francis 
We all miss you! Hope you can still cook in dog heaven
Ohhhhhh noooooo! I've been out of the cooking loop and haven't seen a cooking with dog new video in about ten months! I just rewatched a video to make my takoyaki like their style and I decided to watch any new videos, as I was scrolling I saw that Francis had passed and I cried, literal actual tears and it's just a reminder of how wonderful our critter companions can be and how much he will be missed, by all of us but Chef more than anyone.
May he rest well, and may she find a new constant companion to keep her cheery in the kitchen and wherever else she may find herself!
Thank you to the pair for so many wonderful videos and for sharing a fun bit of life with all of us!
🙏🏻💔🙏🏻
Francis forever...such a happy moment..im glad he was in your life and thank you for sharing him.
Sigue en nuestro corazón!!
Abrazos desde México Maravilloso, Mágico!
LOVE YOU FRANCIS! God bless you!
To reuse a lovely old meme: France's isn't dead, God just needed cooking lessons.
Francis is so missed but I love seeing a sweet moment between him and Chef. Thank you so much for putting this up <3
We will miss you Francis.

Yes Francis will live in our hearts forever Thank you for this video I missed it before.

Can't believe it's been a year since our great Francis has gone. Thank you for sharing this footage of Chef and Francis together!
awww thank you for sharing that special memory <3
I rememeber when I first found you many many years ago. I hope chef is okay. Rest in love Fran. 😢
I'm crying, but he lived a very good and happy life along with the Chef (which is a great person)
I remember watching the bento box tutorial so many years back. RIP Francis 😭💔
This is very painful and I know how it feels, R.I.P. Francis
Thank you for sharing this lovely video chef. We all love you and we all loved Francis. ❤️
R.I.P. Francis

My deepest condolences. I'm sorry for your loss.
I remember when you first announced that Francis is gone. I cried my eyes out. My oldest dog just died too. He was fifteen. It's hard because he's been part of our family ever since we were young. We literally grew up with him. The thing that I'm holding on to is the thought that he was able to receive all the love and care that he deserved and he was able to live a long (in dog years) and happy life.
Fourteen years and nine months, that dog was super strong 💪🐩
OMG.......I'm sorry to hear that
This is so sweet. Brings tears to my eyes. Thank you for sharing
RIP Francis, such a lovely wee dog. Thank you for sharing him with us for all these years, he was a very precious wee dog!
Jumping over a pole? pointless. why waste the energy?
jumping up on Chef's leg? sweet. Worth it.
😍😭 R.I.P. Francis xxx
Thank you very much for sharing this beautiful video ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So utterly precious. The love Francis has for the chef in this video is so plain to see and so pure. R.I.P. Francis and be blessed, chef and staff 💙
My poor little heart 😭 Francis was very sweet and we will be reminded of him whenever we watch a video from you
Honestly such a wonderful moment. I'm glad chef has these sweet memories and thank you for sharing them with us. Francis will always be part of our hearts.
I bet Francis is cooking great meals for everyone in heaven. 💞💞
Rip francis he is always in our hearts forever 💕
Good boy Francis

Chef: [[Jumps over pole]]
Francis: Yeeeaaahhh I don't think so [[Goes around]]

I miss this cute, well-behaved cutie... I always visit back to this video. It makes me so emotional; crying but also happy at the same time. I wish he could have lived for longer, but I really can’t ask for any more from him. He entertained us just with his presence. 
Thank you, Francis. <3
Francis...why?! =:'(
RIP Francis! Hoping you're enjoying delicious food up there with my Muffin <3
Francis will watch over all our cooking endeavors.  Rest, pal.
Oh my goodness, I'm completely ready to cry in public. What a sweet video. Thank you so much for sharing with us! I hope your family is doing well, I know you must miss Francis. He lived such a happy life with you! ❤
I haven't watched this channel in a few years. And the Christmas Cake video popped up in my feed randomly last night. That was the first video I ever saw from Cooking with Dog years ago, and now to know that Francis has passed 😢 R.I.P ...
So saaad! I really liked your videos 💔
I honestly feel like crying. I dont even follow this channel. Today was my first time discovering this channel. Poor Chef, you can tell that they loved each other.
Oh hell no I ain’t got time to cry
RIP Francis - Your Singaporean fan
This makes me sad. Rest Free beyond the final frontier little one
Nuuuuuuuuuu!!😭😭😭😭

MY HEART ...
RIP Francis 😭
Goodnight sweet prince, you will be missed.
So Sorry, WE Miss u Francis! :´(
This makes me sad 😭
My heart ♥️ 😫
I am subscribed to the channel since 2011 I think , and last time I watched a video from Francis was like 4 years ago, today I was searching for the Christmas cake recipe because I want to do it for this new year, and discovered that he is now in heaven. Just want to say thank you to all of the people involved in making all of these videos and recipes, I learned a lot, and even I used some recipes for my cooking class and helped me to pass some tests. Rest in peace little Francis <3
When I found this channel so so long ago it brought me a light heart while I was suffering through some of the darker days of life. It deeply saddens me to see that Francis is no longer with us! He will hold a place in so many of our hearts <3 Thank you for sharing his life and yours as well!
Francis & Chef are so cute
It’s the end of an era I can’t believe this rip little buddy I hope your eating everything from the show in the sky ❤️
I miss Francis. He was a great dog, felt like I met him in person and knew him. He always warmed my heart I have tears in my eyes RIP Francis!
My day was so cool until I saw that video..... Rest In Peace little doggy...
WE MISS YOU FRANCIS
this makes me sad.
Francis was too smart. But too kind. He loved making cooking videos.
Sory for your lost!!!! RIP Francis.
La verdad... mi mas sentido pesame, mi madre yo adorabamos a ese perrito, siempre nos parecia curioso lo bien educado y entrenado que estaba para estar cerca de tanta comida y no comersela.

Por otra parte, yoyambien he tenido mascotas y se lo mucho que duele cuando se van, se le parte a una el corazon.

Definitivamente vivira en nuestros corazones
): this made my hesrt break.
I hope francis is well in heaven!
I hope my dog will meet francis, Soileil just passed away on September. She was old,16 years.

Good bye Francis ( RIP )

So beautiful moment

えぇ…大好きだったから本当に悲しい…😔
I didn't realize he was gone until now, plus we shared the same birthday.. Rest in peace Francis!! Cook well for the rest of the dogs in dog heaven ❤✨❤
Rest in peace, Francis 😭😭😭
Sorry for your loss. He will be the  masterchef in heaven. Take care!
Francis we will miss your forever 😢 I have been watching cooking with dog since 2014 ... even though I m not a early fan of this channel but I’ll still miss you , RIP ~
I remember finding Cooking With Dog early 2016, and I was so sad to hear that he passed. This channel has had such an influence on my journey to moving towards being a full time cook, and has inspired me with food.
I know that if Francis were to see me mess up something during a recipe, he would tell me that there is always a way to start over or to fix it no matter what. Rest In Peace Francis! You have a very special place in my chef heart.
As for Chef herself, I look forward to all you have left to teach and show us!
ありがとうございます！
Love the three of you!
Ahhh, that's sad. I actually gravitated towards these videos because I thought the dog (Francis) was interesting. Francis was not only titular, but a crucial part of the show. I hope another dog replaces him. Perhaps a daschund??
ooops  sorry I thought you had gotten a new puppy...
Thank you fo sharing
Its so nice of you to share all the nice moments of francis's life. We will miss him.
I thought I was gonna cry but all I could do is smile
When i was little, my friends introduced me with this 'cute little pup' and i found this cute guy on youtube. Binge watching videos with Francis and he's now gone. May he live a better life up there :(
We miss you Francis ❤️❤️❤️❤️

14 years for a dog is really long age
My heart truly broke when I heard the news of Francis’ passing. Not long after my own dog passed on 11/28/2018. It hurts knowing my two favourite dogs aren’t around anymore but they’ll live on in our hearts and of course for Francis, YouTube. ❤️😞 Thank you chef, I’ve been on your channel since the first custard pudding video and fell in love with it immediately, from my early teens into adulthood.
Awwww. What a good boy 🐶 🐕🐩
Francis, oyasuminasai. <3
We will all miss Francis!!!😭

I'm sorry to hear about this. Rest in peace, Francis. My condolences to chef and all the friends, family, and fans of Cooking with Dog.
How can you dislike this video? RIP Francis, you'll forever be in our hearts. Seeing Chef and Francis together brings back memories of my mother and my cat having good times together
To be honest, Francis is a great dog, and I am sure we all will miss him. But the reason why I subscribed to the channel wasn't only him, it was the Chef that made great cooking lessons with a lot of joy in life. I am sure, wherever Francis may be, he is happy that he was able to live his life with such an amazing person.
Francis had a fantastic life.  You were the love of his life.  You gave him everything a dog could ask for. He lucked out. Thank you for the post.
Oh nooo. This is super sadddd
Such a sweet dog.
Sleep well pooch.
RIP! I will always love this show!!

Why don't you have another poodle, not to substitute Francis sure, but to show that life goes on, it's just too sad to see Francis's picture. It turns me down, cause it reminds me all the time about him =(  .
This is so sad but that how it is with dogs. Loved watching Francis!

I was confused, because i recently discovered this channel and all the dog does is just stand still, but in the channel trailer the dog moves. I checked the channel history and I found this... R.I.P Francis. I barely even knew you.
💗💗💗💗💗💗
❤️❤️❤️❤️
i wonder if chef has kids. if she does im sure they love her very much, i know i would if she was my mom
🤗🐾💖🐶
It says 2016??? Shouldn’t it be 2017..????
My Peanut, too. There will never be other dogs like them! But we can learn to love again, to give a loving home to a little one who needs us. 💔💗💚💓💛💟❣❤

R.I.P 😭
(TT_TT)
rip
R. I. P
I love you Francis
I remember watching your channel when I was in high school. Anime got me into the Japanese culture and food, and I would make some of your recipes (which are super good). I admit it’s been a while since I’ve last watched a video of you, and I’m sad to learn that Francis passed away. 

I will always remember how cute and obedient he was watching chef cook. We miss you Francis and I hope you’re enjoying running around and eating delicious foods. :)
Goodbye Francis T_T
Francis, im so sorry to know laye but i miss you!!! i remember watching when i was younger but i miss you!  😭😭😭
Miss you 💔
RIP :(

RIP Francis :(
RIP Francis :(

This was the first channel I ever watched on YouTube! Only now learning about Francis’s passing and I’m sooo sad 😢. Rest In Peace Francis
Francis Forever
Feel sad!
I'm so sad
;_ ;
Damn who the heck is cutting onions in here? sobs
I am sorry for your loss.
Just learned he passed away. Damn, this is sad.
Francis was pretty smart! Hahaha once he knew he could just walk around the obstacle, there was no way he was jumping over the pole again. 😂😂😂

Thank you Francis for bringing millions of people joy. :) I hope you all watch over us from dog heaven. :)
Sorry for your loss. Francis will be missed

Rest in peacr
I miss Francis.  Like humans, animals have souls too.  Death doesn't mean the end of existence.  It's energy that transforms itself into a different form.  Call it soul energy.  Chef and Francis will meet again in another incarnation.
We all love you
🌹
I wish Heaven were real... for ... people like you and your dog.
Omg ): no. Francis you’ll be missed. Eat all the delicious food
I feel so sorry for your loss.. :( :( :(
:') te va a estar esperando en el cielo
Francis ;(
My sincere condolences to the chef. I had to put to sleep my baby, my cat a month and a half ago, and curiosly he was also from 2002, so as old as Francis. I know the pain and still feel it...just be strong, they are for ever in our hearts..15 years is a lifetime..... love from The Netherlands.
wow Francis is old, sorry was old
:(
:(
I’ve been watching your videos since high school whenever I wanted to cook Japanese dishes. I can’t believe that this adorable little dog who was always by your side is gone and that it’s been a while. How could I miss this 😢
You will forever be remembered Francis 💙Imagine when the narrator or Chef passes away too. Nooooo 😭 This is selfish of me but I wish they’d live forever and keep spreading they’re knowledge, love and joy.
:(
Sorry 😔
:(
:(
I'm sorry for your loss
NOOOOO
😭
I can't believe I'm just finding this out now... Francis will be in our hearts forever. がんばったね、よくやったぞ 🐶💖
Oh no!  I'm so sorry!
Sadddd
🙏🏻🐶✨💔🙏🏻
Rest in heaven Francis...
What a great dog Francis was.  I hope you are coping with the loss of your friend.
Thankyou for sharing FRANCIS with us!!!!! we are so blessed to have been able to have him in our life even if it was only youtube. I remember watching cooking with dog many years ago,when I was much younger- I even remember worrying during the accident in your life--but mostly how original and genuine your channel was ; unlike any out there for the time!. I lost my dog a few years back and watching Francis was one of the few things that made me happy during that time of loss. I hope that you all are healing well,and can always laugh at the great times,and also be happy that Francis not only made your lives amazing,but spread happiness to millions of other people. thankyou<3
:c
I only just found out he died. My condolences.
❤️❤️❤️
Miss you Francis one of my childhoods best dogs
RIP Francis.

This makes me so sad!!!!
WHAT!?
I had the urge to watch cooking with dog, which was weird since I haven't watched it in two years. As soon as I searched it up this video popped up and my heart dropped. I remember watching your channel when i was 8 and growing fond over froncis, he was a part of my childhood and i will forever remember him.
Aaaaw, I am very sorry.
nooooooo :'( little puppy
;(
Our dog is 7 but hopefully many years to go, can't bear to think of it. RIP Francis.
when Francis died the real me died too
😢
:'c
Sorry for the sad news! Francis will stay in our hearts forever!!!
T.T
sadness
😢
😢
Rest in peace Francis
Sad 😢
We will feel it forever. Sorry.
I saw Cooking With Dog latest video until I just saw a picture of Francis, and I was like "Um. What happen to the dog"? Until I realize that the dog has died. We will miss you Francis, but the show must go on.
There goes my heart all over again 😢😢😞😞
Awe.  I love dogs.  Your dog was so cute.  I am so sorry. I feel you. Belated sympathy
Sorry to hear this heart breaking news, it is really sad 😰
So sad😢
Is the channel dead to?
When a minute Francis died I'm going to cry
Aw Francis ❤️ We miss you!
we miss you so much francis
How long have I been gone ? D8 I didn't know he died. </3
Francis will be forever remembered! I am impressed how well-behaved Francis in front of all delicious food! My dog is 12 years young and always next to me when I am cooking, he is hoping I drop something that he can quickly snatch away!:) I am glad you continue cooking and sharing with us delicious recipes! Many owners adopt another one to continue their great love for their pet...
:( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(
How did Francis die? 😢
Amazing video
Rest in piece Francis...
oh  no...he died on my birthday>.< but i m sure we will see Francis again in Heaven ^^/) love and miss you Inu-sama
😢 💔  🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈 ❤🐕❤
R.I.P Francis.
😔
I haven't been on this channel in a long time, but I'm absolutely heartbroken to find out that Francis has passed away. My dog passed away last year, and even though I have a new dog who I love very much, I still miss my old boy. I know how hard it must be for Francis' mommy. R.I.P. Francis.
I’ve been a silent fan for the most part but today I just wanted to take the chance to thank chef for staying strong for us fans. It’s not easy losing a pet and having to run a show which reminds you of so many bittersweet and precious memories shared. Thank you chef for sharing this lovely video with us and Francis will always have a special place in our hearts.
RIP
Had no idea he died T_T tho I have thought to myself that this dog must be really old now
Aya la comio
Oh no...Francis....
I know I'm late to finding this out, I hope chef is doing okay, and i hope francis gets delicious food and gets to cook delicious food, he will be in our hearts and so will chef, i really do hope she is okay 💕

R.I.P Francis. We will miss you, have fun wherever you are now! 💕

I remember all my dogs that I've had..it's always a sad day when they pass on or you're forced to find them a new home because you're moving to where they don't allow or can't have animals. Francis was a happy dog, well cared for and he will be missed.

I hate dogs but francis was an exception, miss francis dearly!
Our existence is so fragile and finite, we forget that everything is on the verge of death until we realize it again when someone we're close to never opens their eyes again.
I've been with you and Francis since many years ago, I can't even express how heavy my heart feels for you. I will miss Francis and thank you from the USA for sharing so many memories with us over the years. <3 <3

Run free Francis! I just learned of your passing. I only subscribed last January and was still going through old videos when I noticed just today from your new video that Francis had passed away. Not until I read comments that I was still wondering why there was the toy instead of him. I'm so sad. I will miss him sitting so diligently while Emmy cooks 😢😢😢
Francis brought us so much joy, poor chef must miss him terribly. 🐶
Having lost many beloved animal family members myself, I know that no words can really ease the pain or fill the gap left by a dear pet. Even not knowing him personally, news of Francis' death broke my heart and brought me to tears. Much love to everyone Francis loved and who loved him.
Cutie :)
RIP Francis.. 
I'm very sorry for your loss
RIP Francis. I'll never forget you ♡ Chef stay strong. Hugs and love from Italy

Francis, it's been a while. I hope you're doing well wherever you are. We still miss you.
I wanted to learn a new dish, not just chopping onions!!! >o<
We will miss you Francis ♥
May you and your family be comforted
Oh sweetest Francis! Missing u
RIP Francis :'(
I can just imagine little Francis up there with Estelle "Sophia Petrillo" Getty, baking some wonderfully fragrant cheesecake right now und having vivid conversations about their (rather similar) hair styling routines. Thanks a lot to dear Chef & Francis for their entertainment throughout the years. I believe the Omurice video from 2009 was my first ever Cooking with Dog video. Kind regards from Germany!
Nooooo 😭😭😭😭
I thought the chef was Francis.....
I'm so sorry for your loss. I miss Francis too. I'm in USA.

i cant believe its been a year already...... it seems like yesterday l
ごめんなさい、今日この動画が上がるまでフランシスくんが亡くなったことをずっと知りませんでした。
cookingwithdogさんの動画は昔からよく見ていて、シェフさんの手際の良いお料理、後ろで優しく見守るフランシスくんのコンビが大好きでした。
私事になりますが、私の愛犬たちも去年と一昨年に天国へ旅立ちました。今でも思い出しますし、後悔もあるし、抱きしめたい気持ちでいっぱいです。
cookingwithdogさんの動画を見て涙が止まりませんでした。
でも、シェフさんが言うように想い出の中にいますよね！そう思ったらくよくよせずに
想い出と心の中で今まで通り愛してあげようって思いました！
長くなってしまってごめんなさい
cookingwithdogさん、だいすき！
:( I’m sorry for your loss hope he will be happy in the afterlife
:'(
Chef Francis will be missed world wide. Thank you for sharing him with us all.  He was very loved
Whoever is putting thumbs down have no heart's! Francis was an amazing companion with chef and  just amazing in general. I hope he is doing well in Memoriam.
Thank you for sharing this sweet moment. My dog just passed away on Nov. 2.
Francis, Your life already beautiful and completed. Sleep well.
Thank you for all of the wonderful memories.
❤ RIP Francis ❤
I remember watching Cooking With Dog in highschool. Francis has been in my life for over 10 years now. Thank you for being a part of my childhood ❤❤❤

R.I.P Francis . You were awesome
We all miss Francis....best cooking dog ever!
I hate people who say it's just an animal and dont understand our pain...
There are two possibilities:
1st; They have never had an animal.
2nd; If they own one, they dont know how to live on this planet.

There is a side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge im sure Francis and the other animal you loved are waiting for you there <3
Francis will be in our hearts forever!!
So sorry for your loss. It is amazing how much LOVE those little fur balls can give. RIP Francis.
I'm sorry for your loss. I want to thank you for share so much happiness and love for cuisine. You will always be my favourite kitchen team~ 💚💛 R.I.P Francis.

Francis is the reason my doggy has her own chair in the kitchen
忙しくて見ていなかった期間にフランシスが天国へ旅立った事を最近しりました。ずっと見ていたので勝手に親近感をもっていて我が家も犬種は違いますが犬を飼っていましたが今年始めに天国へ旅立ち　家族がいなくなる寂しさがわかります。いまはきっと元気にフランシスも飛び回ってると思います。楽しいクッキングをありがとう。
😔😞
Brasil. ......

Francis ♥️♥️♥️
RIP Francis :(
Im crying
I'm 18 years old and I've been watching this channel since 2011, I think I realized when Francis died I grew up.
Oh petit Francis tu as été rejoindre tous les petits anges et tu veilles sur ta maman de cœur de la haut !
X_(
Awwwww R.i.P francis....poor baby
I don't believe Francis was die before i see it.... Aaaannndd now its already 1 year after It died... So sad
I'm a cook now, and I love every day that I'm making something new.  I  thank both the chef and Francis for fanning the flame to pursue this career.  Francis--wherever you are, I hope you know that you are loved by a thousand-thousand people, myself included!  And chef, I know for sure that Francis loved you with all his puppy-heart.
why did he die
I’m so sad, I grew watching Francis and the chef cook when I was younger and I feel like a little piece of my childhood is missing. RIP Francis
😥😥😥😞😞😞
Is this the dog Fransisco?
What a little cutie he was! My dog will be gone 3 years at the end of November.
Huhu francis
I haven't visited this channel in 3 years I come back only to find this out?! :'(
I still miss Francis. But at least he still lives on through this show. This recipe looks delicious btw, I love matcha ^×^
I'm so glad to see that you're still cooking with Francis in heart, this looks delicious as always!! ^^
Half way thru watching the video I realized cartoon Francis is talking!!! *attempts to hold tears back
Love the hair color chef! I’m so happy you and the team are keeping Francis spirit alive through cooking with love and precision.
that's really creative how francis is speaking on chef's apron and also in the bottom corner~ this recipe is great and thank you again for the amazing video! francis is always in our hearts ❤️
When Francis passed away, I couldn't imagine how Chef could go on with the show. Today, I'm so happy how they kept him very much alive throughout the show (very cute idea,too!). Thank you chef for continuing! We all miss Francis terribly, but through your cooking videos, he lives on 💕
I love these videos but its so depressing seeing the stuffed toy.... I miss Francis
Such a wonderful surprise to see Francis talking!! We all miss him Chef, but we still love you too! After all, you make the food look soooo yummy. Thank you for continuing with CWD. I'm sure you had moments where you wondered if you should. For me I say it's always a terrific way to end my day when I see a new video from you and our beloved Francis. Thank you. Sincerely 
Jenn 💖
Seeing Francis living on through everyone's comments fills my heart with happiness ❤️❤️❤️ he was and is so loved.
A couple years ago, I made the Strawberry Shortcake recipe from your video all by myself. My family loved it so much, my Mom asked me if I could make a couple more for my uncle's benefit, for the silent auction. He had lung cancer and the family threw a benefit for him. He passed away sadly, but one of my other uncles won the cakes! So thanks so much for posting the Strawberry Shortcake recipe! Hope we'll get more cake recipes!
Hi Francis!! It's been so longgggg
I am always so happy when you guys upload 😘💕

Yay~ good to see you guys are still making vids! 😍
Delicioso!
Saludos desde México Maravilloso, Mágico!!
I'm not going to lie. After Francis died, I stoped watching the channel because I was so sad about him passing on. Everytime I tried to watch a new video, it made me so sad that I couldn't bare it. Its been a year now...but as time has passed and seeing chef so positive and happy all the time reminds me that life is life and u got to let go and move on. It doesn't mean you are forgetting anyone cus no one can replace Francis. He will always be in our hearts.
Very good the pronunciation of "Mascarpone" and "Savoiardi" !! :-)
Greetings from Italy
omg has anyone noticed Francis on chef's apron is speaking? that's so adorable.
抹茶味・・・いいかも~（●＾o＾●）
I’m here early! These videos are so relaxing.
Looks too good😍
Missed watching your videos so much!
So happy you posted again!

NICE!
Another great recipe to try and it's nice to see you back! :)
I think they should make the talking Francis a bit bigger so it's more noticeable
3:46 Does the background music remind anyone else of Super Mario Sunshine?
I cried at the end of video. I love you so much. But I miss Francis so much.
Hugs.  🐾⚘🐾
I love how the title indicates "Cooking with Dog."😂
Looks so mouthwatering!!
Oishii!
Chef, you look beautiful!
Happy to see your channel is keeping Francis 'alive'.
Much love from NYC!
I'm not the type of person to tear up but when i saw the plush instead of francis it just felt like i lost my own dog
Francis lives in our hearts ❤ 
That puppy is definitely the cutest thing in the world!
Looks delicious !!! thanks for share to us ,God Bless You ;)
I missed you chief! Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe.
We are so very happy to see you again, Chef! We have missed you!
"Serves 2 people"

Nope.
I really admire you for your deep compassion of cooking :) I miss Francis as well.
Glad to see you back
This is such a cute and creative way to keep the show going! I'm very glad to see that Chef is still going to be cooking for us, and that Francis' memory is being handled so well. This channel is wonderful, and I always wish for Chef to be healthy and happy! <3
Miss you, Francis!!! </3
Happiness has a name, and it's cooking with dog <3
It is great to see you again, Chef. We have missed you!
Thank you folks for uploading! So glad to see Chef again!!
It has been a while,  but I found you guys again - I'm so sorry to hear about Francis' passing. You guys are the best <3
'serves two people' I didn't think so!
We missed you chef!!! Everyone from Hawaii loves your shows.
Thank you chef for another amazing recipe! 😆
I definitely wanna try this out after watching Chef take that bite. Looking forward to the next one! :)
抹茶ティラミス出来上がりっ！
ちょっとレシピーを変わったが美味しそう。
今は冷蔵庫に入り、デザートのために食べますにゃっ！
i dont like traditional tiramisu, but this version i would like to try :)
I'm drooling with this tiramisu again. Arigatou gozaimasu, Cooking with a Dog ( ^ _ ^ )
sees stuffed animal francis  bursts into tears at work  I will always watch this channel, thank you for continuing to teach us wonderful recipes Chef ❤
Thank you for continuing to make videos. <3
My heart ;____; Francis is still with us. His legacy lives on
I'm late and just realized Francis left us, and I'm crying .
I like your smile it's so cute and like the recipe hope one day I will make it. Good luck 🤞
this video was so sweet and calming! :-) i really enjoyed this recipe
Thank you for continuing to make these videos despite the fact that Francis is no longer physically here with us. Watching you and Francis cook always cheers me up and is usually the highlight of my week whenever they come out.
Tiramisu is my favorite dessert... This just made me crave some at 3:41 AM... Thanks, CWD!
I love that you are still cooking chef! ^.^
This looks delicious! Wonderful recipe, chef! I'll have to try this out for a party!
Glad to see new vid, also glad to see you smile chef :)
YUM!!! 💞 just in time for lunch too ☺️
Wow, I love this japanese twist on a classic tiramisu! Looks incredibly delicious, and I happen to have matcha powder in my cupboard.... I'm soooo going to make this! :D
Thanks for sharing!
Thats for 2 people? Hah, i'd eat that by myself, probably. Very nice and neat process! :) -
I miss Francis and love that the plush is being used. I love the talking icon in the corner. The talking and blinking on the apron, however, is unsettling.
I haven't watched in a long time and didn't know Francis had passed on.  I legit cried watching. He was my dog, too. 😥😥
The bowl is for 2 servings
Lel i can eat this alone
Very sad to find out Francis passed 😢
I've never been much of a green tea fan, but I have a whole bag of adzuki beans I'd like to use in various deserts, could you make a few more recipes for those? Thanks!
Great job Chef. The spirit of Francis is truly kept alive, and we as fans will keep coming back ❤️
ah my heart! this is the first video ive watched since i remember Francis passing (Rest in Peace!) the little stuff animal is soo cute!
Thank you for coming back, we love Francis and miss him !
seeing that doll replacing francis reminds me of how much I miss the real francis.
Francis is everywhere! :o -~Points to the corner and Chef's apron~
"Serves two people" - yeah, right :-)
I miss francis :-(... You are having very big heart chef :-(
The stuffed doggie is so adorable....Go Francis!
I always use a hand mixer for that and let it go on the highest setting for about 5 minutes to make the mixture more fluffy in the end, trust me, it works! :)
wow, I thought I was going insane @ 2:00. Nice editing!
This looks so yummy! I bought matcha very recently,  and I was looking for new ways to incorporate it into my recipes, I will definitely try this out!
It's so good to see Francis, one way or another, and keep enjoying the essence of this amazing show.
That's a lovely recipe.
R.I.P, Francis.  Sad to know he is not with all of us.  Keep up a great work, Chef San!
Looks delicious as always! I Really want to try and make this 💗
Hi! Francis. I'm looking your cooking show ^^.
First of all, thank you for your videos.  I just wanted to ask you a question, what brand is your yukihira nabe pan?

Hope that you’re doing well chef. It seems delicious and I love seeing you happy
Just having a tense day..and suddenly treating myself with this delicious tiramisu video..Oh,so sweet and calming!. :)
Imagine white chocolate shavings ontop! Mmm
Woohoo. Matcha.. my favorite things
I missed the dog
chef, you are a profesional! XD
Miss Francis! But I can sense his spirit lives on. 😘
Es nuevo lo del perrito que habla o es que recién me doy cuenta? ... Saludos desde Perú me encanta su canal
Looks really delicious!!! You guys are always awesome!
I didn't know Francis already passed away 😢 I miss him already
i love the little francis in the corner narrating!!
Very creative recipe. Love it.
seeing the doll replace Francis it makes me so sad 😭😭😭
Hi Chef, look delicious!
すっごく美味しそう😋💕
抹茶スィーツ大好きです!!
I'm glad to see you are still going strong in Francis' memory. We love you
I've been watching francis and chef since I was in first year of high school. Now after graduating college and having my own job I remember my high school life whenever I watch these. 💝💝💝
Francis in the Corner 😍 such a cute Detail
I miss Francis but these videos make me so happy! I would love to purchase a plushie. Do you sell them?
I still cry when I think about Francis ;(
This dessert looks gooood! Hugs and loves from Holland!
材料買いましてそろそろ作ってみますっ！
Looked like Francis came back. I felt so happy inside.
I just noticed that the Francis icon in the corner talks! @A@
Thank you for another video!
美味しそう〜♪抹茶も良いですね(´∀｀*)
母が抹茶好きなので、作ってみようかなぁ(∩ˊᵕˋ∩)･*
Looks wonderful! I will have to try and make it soon!
I love these videos so much because they're simple and easy on the senses, kinda like Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. They aren't overstimulating with bright colors and loud noises and fast graphics. Less is definitely more☺️☺️☺️

I can't wait to try this recipe!!!
I missed your videos so much and am soooo happy that you are still uploading them!! :)
omg this looks so amazing!!
So beautiful chef :)  Love you !! <3
Genial!!! ^-^♡
Francis doll we should all have one to commemorate him. 😭
I've seen that spatula on other cooking channels. How do you like it? I've been thinking of buying one.
Wow I haven't watched this channel in awhile and all of the sudden I get the feel for it. So I've been watching old ones. And poof! You release a new video. - Not a fan of matcha but this looks delicious
Im sooo making this!!!... wait wheres the doggy???
thanks chef 😄 is a great job
love from Indonesia <3
i miss francis :(
My soul 😢🐩
Have you guys done steamed buns?
Tbh I expected the recipe to basically be the classic tiramisu, simply replacing the coffee with matcha flavor. 
Instead we get an original recipe idea that uses castella and granola, which is quite typical for Japanese desserts. Cooking With Dog never fails to impress. :D
Welcome back! No greater gift to Francis than keeping him in our minds with delicious food!
I didn't know Francis passed away, I will miss to see how excited he was every time the chef ate some of the finished dish! Best regards from Mexico
It's like the chef never ages. What's her secret?
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't tiramisu use both lady fingers and a cake base?
Yuuuuuum
we miss you francis good boy
Hi Chef! Cold and flu season is beginning. I am wondering if you would be able to show us how to make oyaku. I am most interested in ingredients that would help with nausea. Thanks so much! I can't wait for the next video. ;)
I love it when you do desserts because that's my speciality :9 I love this one especially because of all of the creamy things!
Francis lives on in spirit ❤️
this actually looks easy I can make something now
Somehow Francis's absence hit me especially hard this video. He's never coming back. It's always going to be a plushie or a photograph from now on. It makes me feel lonely. And the first anniversary of his death is just a couple days away…
Hong Kong🙋🏻‍♂️😊美味しね！
カステラで手軽に作れてしかも美味しそう～(´∇｀)
I love matcha flavored desserts. Good job Chef and Francis! 😘
❤❤❤ love you
7mm is a very specific size lol
I love  what she do good luck in every thing you do
Looks yummy ❤❤❤
This looks delicious, I love matcha!
awwww i have missed this videos T.T
A 3 stars recipe by 3 stars Chef !
Glad you haven't ended.
looks good..
saudades da cinza!
Thank you, Chef!   Combining my two favorite "foreign" foods, Japanese & Italian, delights me beyond measure.   Francis lives on in our Hearts, but cartoon Francis is so cute, too.
why is francis a doll now? what happened to francis?
美味しそう
I'm so sorry for Francis :'(
Love yu and ....wait. T^T
Peace brother. But wow this looks good..
wow it made me unbelievably happy to see you guys upload a new video!!
I love this!  Gonna make this without the cake.  I just bought some yummy matcha.
🤤🤤💙
Another wonderful recipe! <3 I love it to bits. Now I had a question regarding the rum - is there any ingredient with which I can substitute it with? I am really bad with alcohol and can't digest it well, so I always need to think about using an alternative. Thank you in advance for your reply, I hope you have a wonderful week! <3
Mascarpone isn't heavy cream!?
Doesn't green tea tastes bitter as hell?
I love you chef!
That roller coaster ride...
Francis Forever! 😀
I love you guys <3
Is it safe to eat raw egg? Perhaps this recipe on works for eggs sold in Japan? :( I have to move there.
Miss you Francis
ブラウニーのレシピがしりたいです！！！ブラウニーって正解がわからないお菓子です。。シェフの腕はたしかなので、なにかありましたら、お願いしますm(_ _)m
😀 Beautiful video!!! Thumbs up !!!!! Have a nice day!!
🙋 👍 😀 😍 😘 🌺 🌻 🌹 🌷 🌼 🌸 💐
Were Is.......
I didn't.know that Francis is in heaven now.. :( I was really thinking about him. :( Dogs are just wonderful gifts from above.... We don't deserve them yet they gave their love. <3 Francis will always be in our hearts..
FRANCIS!!!!!!
Amo tus videos
シェフ様お元気ですか？フランシスちゃん見守ってくれてますね🐩応援してます📣
<3
Yeaaahh! New Recipe! Just in time to try it for a Green Halloween!
Yay! So happy!
食後に食べたいです！
Francis is my spirit animal.
The music in this episode is delightful.
Were's Francis at? sorry if i dont know i have been grounded for 5 mouths
Please continue to make videos! <3
Can you make some Yokan
That looks delicious O
<3 Looks yummy!
At least chef looks happy.
I also use hot water to dissolve cocoa powder. :) Everybody wonders how I do to make hot cocoa without lumps.
そのティラミスレシピー美味しそうにゃっす！
😋😋😋
where's the dog?
Hi Chef! I just tried making the meringue but it wouldn't thicken or form peaks, not sure what I did wrong haha. Oh well, still came out yummy!
♥
Merci CHef : )
Miss Francis!
Can I just say that I loooooooovvvveeeee this channel!
Miss him xooxxooo
Ooh baby!
Yummyyyyyyyyy I wanna try it :P
It looks really tasty... somehow also sexy
look very delicious
Yay!
what does matcha taste like?
Yummy
looks very 美味!
looks yummy~
I miss Francis
Yum Yum
hello
This looks so yummy! I want to make it at home
Oishi. Any substitute for rum?
Looks so delicious!
😊👍👍💕🌷💕👍❤🌹🌸💐
Well, mascarpone is the next level of heavy cream, so there is no benefit of not using heavy cream in this recipe ;)
It's significantly higher in fat and calories. But don't care about that too much because a good amount of fat is essential for a tasty dessert!
are you going to get another dog? I don't mean to be disrespectful, I know they are part of family and you can't just replace them but it would be nice to see another little Francis up there and maybe it'll also make the loss a little more bearable for you :) love the videos as always <3
Yummy
Where is Francis?
great video!! :)
where is dog ? :(
mmm
My husband would love this! Can I substitute whipped cream for the merangue? It's almost impossible to find eggs that can safely be eaten rae in my area.
😧
I dunno if chef has a new dog, but chef NEEDS a new dog. A dog that can bring her happiness and joy once more :3
why they dont adopt other dog friend?
Did the accent get even thicker?
Get another dog!
please tell me i'm not the only one experiencing a bit of an uncanny valley effect whenever i see apron francis talk. i appreciate what they're doing to keep francis involved, but the talking apron is a tad unnerving.
Of course, you can not make this dish in US or continental Europe because eggs there have salmonella ...
This channel is the most pure thing in the world.
"I moved to heaven last November" That's so precious ;///-///;
"I was alive two years ago"


BRO...
I moved into heaven😭😭
I cried when you said that you went to heaven. 😭 Oh Francis. You will always be in my heart. ❤
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Happy 10th anniversary 😊
For such small creatures as we, the vastness is bearable only through love. As someone who has lost a pet as well after 15 years. The dog knows not which day it is, but yet that you will walk him, he knows not the time but that you will feed him. For these reasons and more he knows only that all you do is love him and for that is why he cares not for day nor time because he never counts them when he is with you.
I also have dry eyes, so keeping my eyes peeled during this video is a struggle ಠ_ಠ
I love the shirt!  And I'm gland that Chef is doing well, the best wishes for her! .
My heart exploded after he said "I moved to Heaven last November" - I need to buy at least two Francis shirts
Rest In Peace Francis :(
Damn accidentally found this channel when I was 11 and never regretted that accident was so sad to find out Francis had passed away
I'm trying to count how many times Francis blinks, but I'm scared I will blink and miss him blinking! >n<
Wow, 10 years!! In 2007, I was 14 years old and now I'm 24. Time passed so fast and it's still like yesterday that we all got the news that Francis passed away. My heart goes to Francis in Heaven and to the amazing Lady Chef.
"Francis moved to heaven" IM CRYING SOMEONE HELP THIS IS SO SWEET
Always loved this channel and the sweet people behind it.
Francis <3 hope you are enjoying your time in heaven
Been a fan ever since ethe omurice video, and I've done multiple of your recipes. Thank you for all the wonderful years!
I remember years ago when my friend introduced me to this channel and we cooked some recipes together. Cooking with dog has always been a place of happiness and inspiration. I love the comedy in this video!! Love ❤️
To Francis and Chef-san: thank you dearly for all the wonderful cooking videos and pleasant entertainment you provided us with throughout these years! Kind regards from Germany!
Cooking with Dog is basically my youth. I started watching when I was 17. It's been 8 years. So many things have changed, however, Cooking with Dog is always my all time favorite channel.
Sweet Francis, you are missed💓😔
😥😥😥 just heartbroken
しゃべらない、Ｔシャツか~（●＾o＾●）
I think that I might have blinked a few time too and miscounted D:
Wow I cant believe its been 10 years, Ive watched your videos maybe a year after you started so 9 years OoO amazing! Lots of love to you all!
I got 27!
Oh my dog😂😂😂
Happy Tenth Anniversary, Sensei! Coming up to the one year anniversary of Francis' moving to Heaven must be difficult.. I'm so proud of how well she is doing and how many people are still giving her support! Always looking forward to your videos, Sensei :)
Yay!
Hi Francis! It's been many years since I've been watching this channel and it's always been a joy to see each video. Seeing the quality of the video improve and the recipes being made warm my heart. Even if you aren't here now, you'll always be around in spirit Francis. Thank you for the videos and I hope more can be made in the future!
I've been watching you since I was near 8 years old
Rest In Peace, buddy.
Wait, does the T-shirt talk?
Oh my dog, I love you!
i am very sorry your dog is no longer on the show... but it's probably time for a chibi francis!!!
Aww I like how Francis is talking through the shirt xD (edited)
27?kinda hard to see really. Hope I can win 🖤
Happy tenth anniversary!! I'm glad to hear chef is doing well and I hope she keeps doing well. You're always in our hearts, dear Francis, even if you can't be here in person
Francis, the goodest of good boys. Rip Lil chef. ❤️
This is very cute and charming. Also? Moved to heaven but still can narrate through apron and t-shirts? That's super brilliant ♡

Edit: I've watched your series from a few years ago! I was 11 and now I'm almost 16. It's been almost 5 years, and I still love this channel ;w;)/*.♡

Thank you for this wonderful channel! I really enjoyed watching Francis and Chef doing some kitchen magic! Rest in peace, cute Francis.
i want a tshirt
my tears falling down when I am counting the times lolll
I moved to Tokyo 2 years ago from USA. I wanted to learn Japanese food and found this channel. Now I watch Francis and his sidekick chef to learn all the best food of Japan. Thank you and my dream is to cook with Francis one day!
Love your videos. They are perfect size for me to make.  Happy 10 year anniversary and many thumbs up
I tired entering the contest but it says... error sending message try later... I tired many times now. He blinks 25 times if I win let me know on the YouTube email. Thanks
I watch this show since I was 16 years.. Now I am 22 years old.. Love this show so much.. Keep it up, Francis still can be a narrator through the heaven..
You are and always be the best chef!
I love your videos. I am too worked out studying my college math courses to count lovely Francis's blinks. Can you please let me know where I can purchase a Francis shirt?
Oh my gosh, I'm 22. I'm a grown up lady! xD
I actually SAW some 2007 and 2008 videos just two days ago, as I was looking for a recipe (and OF COURSE it has to be a Cooking With Dog recipe! 😉) I read the wikipedia page, back when Francis passed away moved into heaven, reading how long this channel and show has been running. I'm very impressed!
Good luck with the contest!
I had no idea Francis moved.... away. I'm so sorry. I loved him
The first video I watched was your Okonomiyaki recipe 9 years ago. It inspired me to try again and make Okonomiyaki for my whole family.  Thank you Francis and Chef for all your yummy recipes, always looking forward to more!
I initially counted 25 blinks but two people on here say it's 27 ( O - O ) I'm doubting myself. Which is ittttt aaaaa but happy 10th anniversary Cooking With Dog~ Thank you Chef and Francis for all the fond memories ♥
I love this channel.😌
i grew up with you francis, i felt connected to you over the cooking tutorials and it's still hard for me to know that you left..
This is such a cute video <3 and i've been following this channel since 2009! I learned a lot watching this show <3
This is so cute! I miss Francis 😢❤️
Happy anniversary! Indeed, I was about 15 when I found this channel, now I'm 23! Thank you for all the amazing recipes and fun videos. As much as I miss Francis, I hope this channel will continue for a very long time. Thank you Francis, chef and person behind the camera!
Who else is getting dry eye symptoms from looking at this video on their highest brightness and quality over and over again. 👀 I already have glasses.
Happy anniversary!!!🤗🤗🦄
Why I have to cry while watching this video T_T.
Thank you for all of your videos
Thank you for 10 years of wonderful videos! 💜
Are we just going to ignore that she has AirPods
that's cool but you can get a new dog now. I think that's what Francis would want.
Closed?? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I learned many things from this channel, I will miss both of you
We miss Francis but the channel is so great anyway. :)
💛💛💛💛
Wow 1m subs so happy for you guys!!
It's really hard to count the blinks - sometimes I can't tell if Francis is blinking or if it's just the graphic's overall movements making it seem like he is.
I got 28. I miss Francis, he is the missing ingredient in all the videos T_T
Happy 10th anniversary~

I started watching in 2009 when I was 13-14, and now I'm 23! Thank you for teaching me how to cook Japanese food ^^
チャンネル10周年おめでとうございます、末永く続くこと願っております。
this put so many smiles on my face, thank you!!
Wondering if 27 is a popular answer or is just users deliberately trying to mislead others. Curse you, evildoers!
As usual, very sweet video, looking forward to the next recipe. 
Happy 10th anniversary! love love. wang wang! (sound of a dog barking in Mandarin)
i just love this.
I'm having a lot of trouble counting the blinks, so I might try later, but I wanted to say that your channel helped me so much when I was learning to cook Japanese dishes. I have no idea how many years it has been, but it's been at least 5 years. Crazy, right?

Glad to hear Chef is doing well, and Francis's legacy continues. ♡
I want that shirt :)
i want oneeeeee ^^ <3 plz
Does one have to be 18 in order to enter the giveaway?
It won't let me enter the contest. It says "action not allowed"
oh my dog! LMAO
I start watching your video not long a go but already make many foods from your Chanel, thank you
It's, definitely raining. :(
I ARRIVED LATE 😭😭😭😭
XD This is the most adorable channel I've ever seen :)!! We miss Francis!!
フランシス！

Congratulations on 10 years of the best cooking show! Thank you for years of inspiration in the kitchen :) 🐩

''I moved into heaven''😭😭😭

Aiiiii <3
I miss you, Frances and Cook. This is such a cute video and a way to keep Grances close to our hearts.  I watched Cooking with Dog when my 4 pound white poodle was living and became endeared to Frances.  I hope Cook is doing well.
Happy 10th anniversary
RIP Francis
(since the website wont work, this was my message!)

I can't believe its been 10 years! I remember when I first discovered your channel around 4 years ago...ever since then I have learned so much and cooked so many delicious foods.
I miss you francis, I hope you are at peace in pet heaven and my regards to everyone from Cooking with Dog!
I hope there are more years to come~
I'm not crying... I just have a cold. That's right. A cold. No tears. 9_9
I want a t-short of Francis¡🐶💋😍😇

Happy 10th anniversary

ちゃんとフランシスの口が動いてて最高！
I'm subscribed to Ai's old channel and didn't realize she had made a new one
Why I cried when the t-shirt dog picture was talking?
Oh no! Every time I try to enter I get the message "There was an error trying to send your message. Please try again later." I'll try again tomorrow.
i love you all guys thank you
When does the giveaway close?
I've only been watching you for a few years, but I was 12 in 2007 and I'm 22 now! even though I haven't known about your channel for that long, I've still experienced a lot of change and growing in that time and your videos have remained a constant soothing presence in my life. I already have a Francis shirt (two actually, because I like to have one that's oversized and one that's more fitted for different outfits!) but good luck to everyone who is entering!!
Please make videos often :( i missed the old days
Yay!!
I remember the first time I watched this channel... I had watched the movie Tampopo for about the 100th time and decided I wanted to try and make omurice on my own... I followed the video, but accidentally used American portion sizes, and it all went terribly wrong, but I got it right the second time lol
28?
I was four when i found this channel, and when i became old enough, i began to make the recipes, and they were my favourite childhood dishes, and im so glad to have found this channel. Im 14 now, and i still remember waking up, getting ready for school and hearing the news about francis. He was a good dog and he'll live one forever. Thank you so much for continuing to make great videos. I hope you never stop making great food and great memories. Thank you <3
Felicidades🤗
Love it cx cute 🤗🤗😍

It's not fair that dogs have shorter lifespan than us 😢
I am now 22 and was watching you when I was 12.  I'm headed to college for music therapy and you opened me up to learn how to cook and learn about other cultures.  Thanks so much for 10 years and inspiration to learn outside of school and books and meet new people.

I would love to enter the giveaway, buy I got a headache after the first 10 blinks, it's really disappointing and hard to do when she is walking and moving the whole time, sorry but that's the truth
🐩🐾🐾🐾💝💝❤️❤️
10 years!! I always watch your recipes and always wanted to try it out! But I always put it off! And now I've realized I've been putting it off for 10 years!  How time flies by!
Kawaii
Your influence will always live on, Francis-Sensei!!
you are a ghost, right?
When are you getting a new dog? It's time!
To those who don't know. Francis, the dog, passed away. He's the cute doggy on Chef's T-shirt. 
Also please don't comment about them getting a new dog. If they wanted a new dog, it would be on the video. 

To some people, dogs are more than pets. You wouldn't tell a mother "Oh your child died? Why don't you just pop out another one?".
i was wondering how did they got a voice actor that sounded exactly like Francis. Then I realized dogs don't actually talk...
No one noticed the dog talking on Chef's shirt? That was so cute!
I love how you add Francis to the videos, its adorable.
Seeing the chef laugh and smile makes me very happy :) i hope that with more time the more you can heal <3 💕 can't wait for the next video!
Thank you very much for always uploading quality content and amazing recipes for delicious food~
Love you chef
thank you for another great recipe, chef! love from mexico xx
Thank you! I love how Francis the dog is now talking as a cartoon on the right hand corner of the screen or on the Francis The Dog t-shirt that the Chef is wearing. It's so cute. Genius to keep his spirit alive rather than find a replacement dog. By the way, the Cold Dan Dan Noodles recipe looks super easy. Thank you again for bringing new life to the show with the animation. Kudos!
What a lovely way to have Francis in the videos!  And a delicious recipe as always
SHE'S THE CUTEST OMG
Francis shall live on in our hearts and memories. This simple animation has brought me to tears. ;.; sniffs Welcome back Cooking with Dog team! We love you all! ♥♥♥!!
I love your smile, Chef ! I hope you will always have a good health. Thank you for all your great recipes.
❤

Funny that in Japan people eat spicy food when the weather is hot... I prefer spicy food when is cold :)
Love this way of keeping him as part of your videos. Hope you are all doing okay. Chef is also adorable. 
chef is looking younger than ever
Missed Francis the dog so much. Madame of late Francis, you are a sweet woman with very good cooking talents, and that background voice...you never stress my ears in all the videos you'll make. Love all of you "Cooking with Dog";))
It's never long enough! I wait impatiently for my favourite Cooking With Dog video and it seems only moments before it's over and then I wait again~*sigh*
I love CWD! Chef I'm so happy you have honoured Francis by continuing the show. 
Arigato Chef! 
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁 
Its good to see chef smile again. Francis will be in our hearts forever 💜
It's good to see chef smiling again :-D  Thanks for sharing more videos :-)
Love your channel and your recipes💙 plus I'm so sorry for Francis ☹️
Love all away from Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦💙
I LOVE cold noodles and this video is making me so hungry. Now I finally have a recipe to recreate it at home. Thank you Chef for yet another brilliant video! 😍😍😍
KAMPATEI Chef 👍 ...

This is the first video i have watched from your channel and I love it! Glad I subbed. Great recipe 👍
The  Francis plushie at rhe back is soo cute. ToT
Thank you chef for the recipe!
I've been watching your videos since I first moved out and started living on my own. Thank you for teaching me how to cook and helping me (basically) survive, Chef!
食欲をそそります~（●＾o＾●）
Oiishi thank you Chef.  Love your shirt with Francis. He is well missXxx

Rest In Peace Francis ❤️ thank you for brining joy to my life over the years!
The talking Francis animation on the shirt and at the bottom right side of the screen is so adorable and this recipe looks delicious! Thank you for sharing Cooking With Dog!
I love how you laughing chief 😀and i love how you added Francis to the video waiting for more videos plz dont be tat much late plz 😘
chef is so precious...💕
It's so good to see you Chef!!!!

Made me very emotional.  Love you!
Thank you for another delicious recipe Chef!! I always look forward to your videos. 😃
Even if I don't like the food/recipe, I always have to watch your videos. I love Chef and Francis too much!
This looks delicious. We won't forget you, Francis!
Good Morning. Thank you for many years that I watch, your subtitles are the best for my Brazilian Portuguese. Thank you very much.
Chef, your videos are wonderful. Please keep up the amazing work. 

Also, can you please show us how to make a diabetes friendly desert? We love your show, but we have a diabetic in our family.
So glad to see you so happy Chef! hope you are doing well !! ^^ thanks for this recipe, it looks so good !!
Chef you're so adorable, and I'm glad that Francis is still hosting the show 💖
when you cook with that smile, it makes me love food even more! thanks
I love seeing you smile chef. It's so infectious. Keep smiling and keep laughing. That's what Francis would want.
Chef seems happy! :) That makes me feel happy too!
Thanks for keeping up the videos guys! They make my day! <3
"what's so funny, chef?" My *heart*
I'm glad you're making videos again.  Chef I understand what its like, when my dog died I cried for days.  I also felt like I lost my best friend.
Any day with a new Cooking with Dog upload is a great day. <3
I really miss Francis but it's nice to see that he is still around. So we will never forget about him 🐶❤
It's so lovely to see Francis talking from the chef's shirt💙😍😍🙌🏻
I love Francis, and I also love this channel. ♥ Keep up the good work
The lady in the video is so cute. She remind some of my grandma :)
Hi there, great recipe! Could you explain why soy milk would be a substitute for chicken stock? Chicken stock in the US is very salty, so how does soy milk compare as a substitute? I love learning how substitutions are made, so even an explanation from another dedicated viewer would be nice!
Sensei was in a really happy mood, i love the giggle.
The video was awesome, but I still miss Francis though... X'(
I love Chef sooo much! She's such a precious human being <3
I love the way you add Francis in the shirt :D Gosh, this looks so delicious I wish I can cook though ;((( Greetings from Mexico!!~
Hi Chef. I was just wondering how you are doing?
So glad you're still making videos ❤❤❤❤
I really like the idea of putting a little icon of Francis in the corner. the talking t-shirt was a good experiment as well but over all I think you would do better with just the one in the corner, more consistent and less work for you. Keep up the good work, love to see you trying new things for the channel.
I love your show so much! I've admired how much effort you put in your videos and recipes. Chef, you're a delight and your with ethic is admirable. You're an inspiration and I hope you're well. 😊❤
I miss Francis, but this is a sweet addition and tribute! thank you!!
Hugs for Chef and Francis! Love the shirt! Talking Francis!!!!
I love the talking t-shirt. The food looks so good too. I hope you are all doing well.
miss my favorite poodle ♥
Chef's hair looks really nice like that.
Yay! Chef is back!! ❤
This recipe looks yummy! Thank you Francis :)
chef looks younger than ever
I love the francis icon. I just absolutely love this channel. Keep up the great work.
you should make a patreon account! im sure there are tons of people who would love to support this channel
So sorry for your loss. I do love how you have eternalized him into a talking cartoon. Great channel. All the best to you.🐩😇
Much love from New Mexico! Your recipes are always the best, Chef. <3
It's so much easier to follow the recipe while hearing Francis give instructions. Great job and delicious dish!
Cooking with dog, can you please make a non tofu dango?

Spicy and delicious!! I love this recipe, Chef!
I love the new format!  Thank You!
Is it ok to substitute yellow miso? I cannot find red in my area.
Will you be getting a new furry friend host? I miss Francis.

Aww chef is so cute. 
This looks delicious! I think i might try this with different noodles.
Chef! Your recipes are the best!!! I made your katsudon recipe and it was a succes!! Love from Bolivia!!
So good to see new delicious recipe videos. Francis's spirit lives on in your wonderful videos. Love from Oregon!

Voice of Francis reminds me as the Japanese version MS Sam. Talking animated shirt is adorable! :3
I love that chef looks so happy while cooking <3
Oh my I just noticed the talking Francis in the corner!! how adorable! <3
Another Cooking With Dog video!!! My day has been made so much better! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍😍😍
oooh I'm sorry to hear Francis passed away. :(
2:49 Oh my gosh I saw Chef's shirt amd almost screamed 😂😂
Can't wait for the next one, looks like Matchamisu, instead of Tiramisu :3
I'm always waiting for the new recipe. Arigatou gozaimasu, Cooking with Dog! Forever fan from the Philippines ^_^
Great recipe! Oh man, and that preview looks amazing. Looks like a matcha tiramisu... two of my weaknesses combined!
We miss you Francis
These foods all look so good and I would love to try them but I can't find many of the ingredients where I live 😢
This was a wonderful video. The tantanmen looks absolutely delicious!
What a pleasure to see you back. Great idea the anime Francis.

I wish she was my grandma
I hope chef’s next dog is going to be a shiba inu
I LOVE FRANCISSSS

Thank you as always, Chef! It looks delicious!
Did they eat the dog
Who voices Francis? It really sounds like Ken Tanaka
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one for Teishoku pleeeease...I'm a long time subscriber of your channel. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲

Not a fan of spicy food, but the next one sure does look good :-)
I really have a hard time understanding your heavy accent
Just found out fransic is gone. Im so heartbroken. I remember watching these videos since i was in middle school. :(
Hi chef ! Nice recipe thank you :)

Thank you chef!
I've had something like this before, it's pretty good.
I can't stop looking at the chef, she reminds of my grandma) love your show, take care.
you make me hungry i like your job
I miss Francis already...
I love the Francis animation <3
This looks delicious and refreshing!
Francis was sitting so still that at the beginning I spent some time to figure out if he's alive. Such a wonderful little dog. He 's pretty bad in jumping low fences but he's so good at his video making work. He had to sit still. He was great. Bye bye, Francis. Gangbadei ! Chef lady. Domo arigato.
Nooooooo  Francis, I miss you. Come back bae. I miss my favourite doge
There's a Japanese restaurant in my area with this menu, but....I think that was bland as hell
I miss Francis!!!😢😢😢
おいしそうですね！
ブラジルには冬なのに、食べたいんです。<3
I miss Francis so much.  This is the first episode I've watched since he passed away.   The cartoon Francis is a wonderful memorial, even though it made me tear up.  It was good to see Chef cooking and smiling again.  <3
I miss Francis :(
Don't LET THIS DISTRACT U THAT MAYWEATHER WON THE FIGHT
Noooooo Francis was my favorite dog ever i have a dog just like him
Oh no! I just found out about Francis' passing. I'm very sad now
Love the dog talking, nice tribute to Francis.
This is simply entertaining:-)
I'm so sad not seeing Francis beside Chef :'( I miss him TT__TT
I wish there was a cooking with dog app 😣
The best chef <3 <3
I think I think this about every recipe but this looks delicious, Chef! Would you let the meat cool completely or serve it warm with the cold noodles?
Hello  Francis, I hope to see you someday. With love
Delicius,I liked your channel,I loved  japonese food,bye
Delicioso!
Gracias!
Abrazos
I have been following this channel for years now, it is always my favoritie cooking channel
Is there a way to cook this not spicy?
Beautiful plating sure looks delicious

美味しそう〜！
The way you add Francis to the videos its just beautiful!!! Im so glad you guys came back, awesome videos... please make another bento recipe. Hugs from Puerto Rico!!!
I made this for dinner last night, it was soooo tasty! Thanks :)
途中で使っている黒いヘラは無印のかな？だとしたらお揃いだ✨
Francis is speakiiiinnng!!!

miss you Francis
i just want to get older looking as beautiful and healthy as chef...i wonder if the japanese cuisine is part of her secret
あれ、総裁どうした？ど根性になってる。お亡くなり？
I love the shirt talking
UGH IT LOOKS SO GOOD
Te quedo genial
私はこのレシピが大好き！私は特に暑い日に夏の間にこれを食べて育った、そしてそれは私がハハを楽しんだ唯一のスパイシーな料理の一つでした！ありがとうシェフ！
Thank you for continuing to share your love of food with us, Chef. May I request a salmon sobameshi recipe? I had it at a restaurant that has shut down and it was my favourite dish on their menu.
rest in doggy paradise Francis. We miss you
Uaaaaaaaaaa oishisoooooo... omedetou gozaimaasu... kyouwa sugu tsukirimasu, obaassan! 🤗 Brazil kara!!! Loveee
en español por favor
This food looks very tasty! 　早速作ってみようと思います✰
The talking Francis dog in the beginning was so cute!!
Did anyone else notice the little Francis speaking in the corner of the screen?  Too cute!
im so sorry to hear that francis passed away,but I hope you get better!!!!!
oh no... poor Francis ;( I like that they didn't try to replace him with another dog.
Chef looks good!
"What's so funny, chef?" hahaha
Gracias por la simpleza y la calidad de todo el contenido.....Arigato!!!....Desde la Antártica.
I love the effects with Francis
RIP Francis hope your having fun in dogs heaven 😢😢😢
WHY THE HELL DID I JUST GET A NOTIFICATION FOR THIS!!!!
I watched it through because of the narrator..
Francis is died...But it okay, I try not to cry those day I watch the video she make with him. #WeLoveFrancis
Haha I love Francis in the corner!
❤🐶👩
Tantanmen is my fave!
This looks absolutely delicious!
That shirt is hella cute.
Love chef
This looks delicious and looks like it can be made vegetarian very easily!!
:9 Trying this one tonight!
Thank you, Chef!
we love you, Chef. Hope you are well.
I am going to make this!!!
I'm so happy that Francis is still here in spirit to host.  :)  I love the little animations!
https://youtu.be/5oP-tv3aJxM
4:05 😊
I love tantanmen! I'll have to try this out sometime...
awwwwww miss u lots ^^
Thank you Chef, I love your videos. You make me and my baby happy with your food and smile.
Please get a new dog. you know its the right thing once that small ball of fluff is there <3
you guys are the best!!!
Hi chef, i love japanese food so much. Can you make video recipes for chukaiidako? I like it but don't know how to make it my self :'3 Thankyooou :*
yum!!!
これはおいしそう！！
I can not wait to try this one always looking for new noodle ideas.
That looks SO DELICIOUS! 😋
I miss Francis very much and I can tell you do as well. You look just a bit sad and I see moments when Francis would have showed interest, you get a sad look at these times. I know all dogs go to heaven so don't worry too much, he's like your own guardian angel now 🐩😇⛩
It's not the same really...😢
That looks scrumptious!
I miss Francis so much !! :,[
The animation is so cute <3
I just ate breakfast and I am now hungry again because of the video :D
Creepy English accent.
Hello, I just have a quick question concerning bamboo shoots: When you buy them shrink wrapped, but only use a small amount, how do you repackage and store the rest, and how long will it last?
Omg that looks so yummy! I wish I could make this!
Talking Francis on Chef's shirt is pretty cool, but it gets a bit creepy and distracting D:
Oh chef, this looks delicious! I bought a suribachi mortar recently and I love miso, so I'll be trying this recipe soon!! Thank you very much!
I know Francis is gone now but with the animated Francis hope you can go back to the days when you'd post a video once a week instead of every now and then.
フラアンシスいないけれど、なにかあったのおですか？
We love you chef!
I miss Francis so much 😢
Sashiburidana
how do you get the chili bean paste
Can middle eastern tahini replace the japanese white sesame sauce?
YES
😭😭😭😭😭😭
我听到了豆瓣酱😄
chef is so cute :3
😢😢😢😢😢😢
i like chef i dont know what or where but i just like her so much
👏🏿 Chef ☺️
Can you do the somen Récipe please
I didn't come here for a long time...  where is the dog?
Happy to see u guys again
❤
Oishii!
Did you say you can add soy milk instead of chicken stock?
Japan should be the culinary capital of the world!
💕💕💕
I would love one of those shirts
The dog picture in heaven is very cute
I haven't been watching ur fabulous videos and then I found out at the comment section that Francis died. I'm so sad right now.
Love you guys
i miss Francis.
looks lovely.
that looks sooo good
Where's the dog???? OMGGG literally I'm missing something 😣😣😣
like
What a yummy looking dish chef :) I want to try to make this :D
First!
I was avoiding watching their video for a while now after Francis died because I didn't want to not see him in the future videos. I'm so glad that they made a character out of Francis instead of getting a new dog.
What's so funny Chef? :)
Is it weird that I get misty eyed every time I see the toy dog?
Why am I watching this at 3:23am when I have to get up for work in 4 hours???
暑い夏には食べたくなる一品です、冷やしラーメンより
冷やし担々麺やラーメンサラダの方が好き。
ずっと拝見させて頂いてましたが
始めてコメントします。
いつも隣に居たワンちゃんが居なくて寂しいです🐶
This looks so good. I want to eat it right now.
I couldn't help but laugh a little at Chef rushing to get the noodles in the ice water
where is the next episod
Is there a way to make the sauce without Walnuts?
Good animation... I like how you've, uh, immortalized him. いいアニメーション...私はあなたがどうやって永遠に彼を不滅にしたのが好きです。
It looks so delicious, but unfortunately I can't eat it because I'm a vegetarian.
Mmmmhhhh looks yummy! <3
😊
わんちゃんは何もしないのね笑
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍
I wonder if one could replace the spicy paste with sriracha sauce. If so, I'd only need to find some ramen noodles and I could cook that.
where is francis ?
Uh!!where your dog??
Chef, I am allergic to walnuts, is crushed sesame seeds okay as a substitute?
Ye
dog died and got replaced with an animated character.
to all the viewers, Please, I know how much you love Francis and mean good but if you keep mentioning him, the owner will keep being reminded of him and get upset every time she reads the comments :(
She going to die
Such bright red dobanjang. The stuff I buy is usually a dark reddish-brown color.
Oh no .. what happened to the doggy?
Woah! First time noticing the dogs mouth is moving... now I understand why it's called "cooking with dog"!!
Wheres the real dog btw?
Wie immer Super.Nice...
Where's Frances?
冷やし担担麺はじめました~~~
Where is the real dog?
I have a question about the suribachi mortar and the surikogi pestle. If I can't find them in the market, what can I use to replace these two?
Still not getting a new francis look alike?
where is your dog ?
🌺yummy🌺
Where is the dog
someone please tell me what happened to francis
💛💚💚💙💚💛💜💚💚💙💚💖💖💖
where is francis ? is die ?
Wait did the dog die?
You are the best! 
Where is the dog??
Second mothsfuckassss!!!!!
thank you chef my family all love katsudon we make it from your recipe now if i could just get things like this into their diet  :-D
what happened to the dog?
Animation on shirt was creepy af. Still like the show tho.
Lemme guess. The dog died.
Maybe you should get a new dog? I miss Francis but a new dog would give a refreshing feeling, and im sure Chef misses the company of having a dog around
I think it's time to leave the dog gimmick behind.
where's the dog, the real one???
We need to let Francis go. Show DOES need a new puppy.
However, cooking side is still here, so awesome!
Oooooh I thought this was how to cook dog
Please get a new dog
We all love Francis! But maybe you should get a new dog?
Guys let's not suggest the lady to replace Francis with a puppy. You never know how much Francis meant for her and she might have already thought about it at one point, but couldn't bring herself to replace him.
no puppies could replace Francis
Yay!! the chef knows xD "this goes well with a cold beer" yup :D Greetings from México !
Yay a Mex-japanese dish! 👍😁👍🌴🦂🌵💀🐃🇯🇵🇲🇽
I am so here for talking Francis on the apron and in the screen corner <3
I'm glad to see the chef up and going. That's a very good sign.
I'm still so amused by the adorable little animation, tracked to the cooking apron. It's a really cute effect.
Also love Chef's reaction at 4:23 Haha. It was a cute mixture of being proud of the accomplishment, yet bashful at the quite extravagant result. So sweet. ⧁ᴥ⧀
Francis is probably one of the most remembered dogs in modern times. He is missed, but live on in the hearts of many! 🐩
Oh the animated Francis is the cutest thing!  What a great idea and a wonderful tribute to him!  A beautiful way to keep him going!   Love this and love the recipe Chef!!!  So glad to see you still posting recipes!  <3 <3 <3
I love Mexican/Japanese style food so amazing, thanks for the recipe, great job!!
So delicious 😋
My stomach rumbled just looking at it. xD Chef's smile is as beautiful as always, please send her my love! If it's okay, I would love to see Chef give some tips for beginner cookers (eg. how to hold a knife and use it to dice things), or even give us "cheap meal alternatives", such as how to spice up simple things like instant ramen or porridge. <3 Thank you very much!!
The animated Francis was a wonderful touch. It's really good seeing Ms.Chef in every video.
I really appreciate you all continuing to share recipes with us. I would have completely understood if you stopped. I feel like these new videos are honest tributes to Francis. Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I MISS FRANCIS!! :'(
That art gives me the feels.
This makes me so hungry! But I am only on day three of recovery from my tonsillectomy surgery and still can't have solid food. The only thing I can chew is ice. I can't wait to try this when I can eat solid food again! 
Thank you for the new recipe Chef!!
The tiny Francis in the corner is too cute!! Nice to see you chef!! 🤗
Looks delicious!!
We miss you Francis, rest in peace little angel
すごい！！フランソワーズちゃんが、よみがえった(＾◇＾)エプロンのフランソワーズちゃんも動いたー！！
ありがとうございます~（●＾o＾●）
It took me like two minutes to notice the different music! Fun change to hear something different. Also i hope they aren't animating that talking Francis by hand. That would be a lot of unnecessary work when it could potentially be automated using the narrators speech. 

And I was thinking to make tacos today too! ....But like the ghetto version with ground meat and tortilla chips. Still delicious though!
Oh Jesus people, puppies don't fix everything. Leave the poor woman be losing a fluffy friend is very hard.
Cooking with dog is one of the only recipe channels I can actually follow along with while I cook. Thanks for making it easy for a simpleton like me
Looks delicious as always! I might try this out soon. I have most of the ingredients...
Sorry about my english, this isn't my first language. It's a work in progress, but I need to tell you this...I'm from Brazil and I'm really happy with a update. Thank you for continuing to work on the channel even without Francis. It must be very painful for you and I understand ... so thank you so much for continuing! 
本当にありがとうございます。
This is my type of food! <3 Thanks chef.
the animation of Francis is so great ! アニメショはとても良いです、嬉しい！
ハロー、シェフ！いつかチャレンジしたいレシピだったので嬉しいです。彩りも素敵。音楽もいいですね^_^
いつもありがとうございます！
日本は夏本番かと思いますが、体に気をつけて。。
natsumi
I am mexican, this looks delicious!
I just love seeing the Francis on your apron talk, it's like he is here with us! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!
I sometimes watch the old videos just to see francis
Chef, absolutely love the talking Francis animation. Makes me miss our host so much! Thank you for continuing to create.
The talking Francis is the cutest thing ever!!! Thank you for another wonderful video, I'm sure Francis wants to try it as much as I do ☺️💓
I miss Francis too much!!!🐩😭❤
I am a Mexican-American. This recipe seems like a very refreshing take on tex-mex taco salad!
Thank you dear Chef (and Halo-Francis) for gifting us with another of your wonderful cooking videos. Kind regards from Germany! (^_~)/
This Looks sooo delicious! Thank you for this amazing recipe!! Please continue making great videos! Btw I love to see Francis still explaining the recipe
I love so much the talking Francis, it isn't like having the real one with us, but it's soo good ti make me cry all the time! Please keep the show going.
Okay.  The animated Francis in the corner?  Neat.  I like that quite a lot.

The animated Francis on the APRON?  That's kinda scary.
japanese food based on mexican dish.
This hurts my heart. I am watching the video and trying not to cry. I love and miss Francis so much.
What happened with Francis? I'm sad 😢😭 thank you so much for your videos, I love your recipes and also I love francis, always in my heart.🐶

Love you and your channel 😍 Hope all is well. I'm glad you are still posting videos and can't wait to see more.
So nice with a recipe that doesn't require you to buy some 'package of seasoning', but actually tells you what spices to get. xd

Chef, can you make hoikoro, please??? 😋
I feel like this is the first time I realise that at the bottom right corner, Francis' mouth is actually moving! Really adorable touches :)

As per usual, this dish looks delicious!
The channel has never been the same since Francis died hasn't it?
I miss when Francis could smell the food cooking and he would whine for some. 100/10 goodest boy

good cooking video Taco Salad (Spicy Salsa and Taco Meat Recipe) | Cooking with Dog
Looks so tasty! I think I'll try this for dinner tonight. I'm glad to see chief happy, we all miss Francis so much <3
we miss you francis!! 💖
I love this over rice - taco rice (which I had growing up in Okinawa)
I love the animated Francis in the corner. ❤
Thank you so much for doing a video every once in a while, i really enjoy watching and learning from chef.
love the animated Francis(^__^)
Hey she was missing the cheese we Mexicans in Texas love our Taco Salads with goat Cheese on top! 🤣
I know my fiancee will want to make this, and she knows I like spicy foods. Great, now I'm hungry.
the YOU LIKE BUTTON at the end always gets me. so cute.
Aw I love the picture and the little animated talking Francis. :) May he rest in peace. xo
i like to watch old vids for francis
This is the most beautiful taco salad that I have ever seen! So lovely and appetizing!
the artwork next to chef made me  e m o t i o n a l
おいしそう٩(●˙▽˙●)۶
this is the fanciest taco salad I've ever seen. usually it's just ground beef and a seasoning packet thrown on chips with cheese and hot sauce
Yum.......yum
looks super delicious =] ; #NEVERFORGETFRANCIS
iT's great to see you smile again chef! Good luck in the kitchen! <3
The talking Francis in the corner is good, but you should remove him from the apron. It's gotta be a pain to track the movements.
Chef, can you please make a croque madame?
Welcome back chef.
Can I simply say what a aid to seek out someone who truly knows what theyre speaking about on the internet. You definitely know methods to carry an issue to gentle and make it important. More people have to learn this and understand this side of the story. I cant believe youre no more well-liked since you positively have the gift.
Aloha Chef!  It's so nice to see you!
We will miss you, Francis!
The talking Francis head in the corner is a cute touch! I suggest adding sour cream and/or guacamole. That salsa looks great and the beef seems like a nice alternative to ground beef. Gonna have to try it!
These videos are so pure and sweet, I love them so much...
美味しそう！いつも素敵💕🐩
Lol at Francis in the corner talking when the voice over speaks <3 cute!
That's long to see this since maybe 1 month already
Animated talking Francis is a nice touch! Glad to see you still make videos 😊
すごい 美味しそうだ。来週試しに作ってみる、いままで側にいるお犬は？
I miss Francis. I'm glad he was not replaced with another dog but a cute little drawing
Nice to see you again. Love from Morocco.
Francis will always assist from beyond the grave. Francis forever!
Chef is soooo cute, miss francis so much💕
So glad you are still making videos, Chef! Missing Francis so much, his little personality was awesome, but I love the talking Francis animation in the corner. It really is such a nice touch and a wonderful way to honor his memory! Loving your videos as always, keep it up! (^_^)
I love you chef and I also miss francis
I don't like hot salsa, otherwise the food looks magnificient! Thank you!
Still can't tell if this is Cyrus Nozomu Sethna or David Ury aka Ken Tanaka narrating.

Anyway, I love your show. Thanks for your hard work. お疲れ様でした \(*ˊᗜˋ*)/♡
いつも、味しそうで綺麗でステキです。
夏バテだったけど食欲でました。
ありがとうございます。
Your videos are little moments of happiness.
Cooking with ghost ;-;
I LOVE your recipe!
その美味しそう!!!
I want to make this!  It looks so yummy!  I love her recipes, have fixed a few & they are awesome!
What amazing looking ingredients! So colorful!
An alternative would be flat iron steak sliced across the grain. it can be  just as marbled as the meat she used. It also cooks as fast.
Meh, stop talking about Francis... He's gone now, but most important thing is still here: food. Amazing, fantastic food.
I LOVE THIS LASY SO MUCH SHES SO SWEET
I'll miss you, Francis Y__Y
wait. you cant say cooking with dog anymore because hes not here with us
The talking Francis in the corner is perfect!!!!
Colorado approved.
おいしそう！タコサラダ暑い夏にもぴったりですね(*^^*)
Best trick for fresh salsa is to broil the chillies and bell peppers, use lime juice, cumin, no oil.
the recipe is perfect i love it
I remember watching this for tips on cooking two years ago. However, it will never be the same or the complete show without Francis. May he rest in peace.
料理人さん、いつも熱心に美しくて美味しそうなレシピを作って教えてくれてありがとうございました
love you chef & francis
Looks like zha jiang mian for the next video!
Okay... you lost me at ketchup. That's not taco seasoning. However, watching taco meat being turned with chopsticks is fantastic. I love this show and have been a fan for years. I hope it goes on for years to come. ... Also, I recommend adding a dollop of sour cream at the top! :)
Hello Chef! you are the first channel I subscribed to on YouTube, and I dearly miss Francis. I know he's having a great time being our pupper angel. 💙 Thank you for continuing to make videos! Animated Francis is the cutest thing, and I hope more videos will be posted soon! Always take care Chef, thank you for this. 💙 love from Manila, Philippines! ❤
I love watching Chef cook - it makes me smile. ^_^
so very Happy to see you back on
Animated Fancis makes me very happy, both on the apron and in the little cornee
love your smile chef
I teared up when I saw the drawing. I miss Francis so much.
Nice to see a dish with influences from my home country, looks delicious!
I've been cooking Mexican food for 50 years and never put soy sauce in it. Looks interesting though
Silly Chef, that's Pico de Gallo, not salsa.
Francis <3
そのアニマションはとてもかわいい！！！よくやった！！
I love you Chef!
Omg that picture is way too cute
Hi Chef! Do you have any favorite stir fry in a wok dishes you would like to share?
coriander = cilantro. i didnt know this until today!
RIP Francis
Super...Super...Nice  ....💙💚💛💜💓👍
Francis will be with us, always.
Whaaat!? That animated Francis is the wildest thing! xD
I miss him
คิดถึง ฟรานซิสมากนะ อยู่บนสวรรค์คิดถึงแม่ไหม
Chef this looks delicious! We love you so much!
Awwwwwww
レシービはポルトガル語で書いてくれたありがとござい便利になった
おばあちゃんのご飯思い出す🍚
talking francis on the apron is such an adorable addition!!!
chef, can you make a video on how to make a delicious ganmodoki?
I love Francis on the apron and in the corner xxx
Guys did anyone recognize or saw francis apron is talking 😅 hehehehe
Put some sour cream on top of it
un rico deep con totopos  ♡♡♡ con su bien pico de gallo ♡
That animation of Francis is life 😄
This Japanese salsa looks better than what I've seen at "authentic" Mexican restaurants!
良い肉使ってますねぇ
love animated francis
i cook while watching this video even if i do not have a cookbook
I think we should not replace Francis with another puppy.
This looks delicious chef, can't wait to give it a try! Home made salsa is always great on a hot summer day.
oh man I lost it with the heaven comment at the end... is made me remember of how much I miss my dog and It's been 10 years since his passing.
Like this recipe!
Never fails to make me smile
This might sound ignorant but I didn't think tacos was a thing in Japan.
I get so happy when you guys upload
Oh, now I'm craving for Mexican food right now!!
Mmmm tacos
me encantan todos los videos, los veo siempre q puedo más los de postres.
me encantan todos los videos, los veo siempre q puedo más los de postres.
2 viandes de bœufs, 2 piments verts, + sauces salsa
<3
Where is dog?😣🤔😍
Omg. Animated apron
You're missing the beans
I miss Francis so much.
Still good stuff
Francis has a little friend in doggy heaven!
I only just learned of Francis's passing. I am so sorry for your loss. I may have only started watching last year, but these videos are beautifully done with clear instructions and helpful information, and they inspire me to add Japanese influence to my home cooking. It's a little hard to watch right now with the news so fresh, but I hope you enjoy continuing to make recipe videos for us, Chef, they are really great! Especially with little talking Francis, so cute!
At first, I was worried the dish would come out weird. But of course Chef knows what she's doing. I've eaten a lot of tacos before but this is amazing. High quality meat, a seasoning mix that actually seems super authentic but also unique and a delicious-looking salsa fresca. There are any number of local restaurants that can't compete with this.
we will all miss frances
❤️
😢😢😢😢
:) thanks
I see him blinking! cries
Miss you Francis
Madre De Dios my culture..
Thanks Chef :)
love i chef xD
I've always wanted to learn to make salsa! :)
I miss you francis
😭🐩
México presente, y somos más que salsa ☹️ y tortilla(que quién sabe por qué la fríen)
hi francis
please tell me im not the only one who noticed francis moving on chef's apron at the end
She looked so happy when she made the crown :D
おいしです。
初めて動画を拝見させて頂きましたがとても美味しそうです！
過去の動画も今後の料理に参考にしたいです(^^)
no dogs or puppy's can't replace Franscist even if it's similar to him
i just want to eat this with my hands cuz its looks soo gud!
いつも見てますが、コメントは初めてです🤗どんな時もこの動画を見るとホッコリするしお腹がすきます🌮タコスは私ほんとうに大大大好きなので楽しみにしてます🙋
it is fit for a king.
I think this works really well, having a cartoon Francis talk. Maybe you also could put him on a stool, where the real Francis used to be? Although I like the Francis art in his place, too....
Chef, I love you
Wow that looks good I'm from Texas and taco salad is a Tex-mex food and that taco salad looks more better, fancier and you use the good meat because majority of the time we use ground hamburger beef.  Good job!!!!
Oooh, trying this tonight to kick off the weekend!
I am always amused when people say "tomato ketchup". Is there such a thing as non-tomato ketchup? I mean, maybe there is. I don't know.
I would love to see an episode of Chef with Venetia from NHK traveling together trying out traditional Japanese cuisines with Dog, for the next Go! Dog! show! :)
Cilantro not coriander
Chef is very cute <3
Now I want some of that taco salad and put it inside tortillas <3
Oh i miss francis:(
Chef is so cute
This channel is so weird.
🐩ワンちゃん亡くなっちゃったんですね😢 🙏
いつも美味しそうな料理を見て参考にしています💖😋
most delicious crown :)
Did Francis pass away? 😢
Quiero tacos! :/
why dont have spanish :(
魔！みりゆらのをるはさな
This is better than any taco salad here in u.s.
New video yay!!!! 😄
I am very happy that the speaking Francis is subtle enough that I didn't notice it at first! But now that I see it I think it's a nice touch and is not distracting at all from the cooking and keeps some of Francis with us always💓nice job 💕💕
im sorry but i cant watch this cooking show without getting so sad..i wished the chef would reconsider getting a new dog but i understand how important Francis was to her, so i wont be too disappointed about it..but still, i cant watch this show anymore without feeling this emptiness
When Chef makes a better salsa than the restaurant in San Diego where I ate last weekend.
I like the Francis icon in the corner, but the pulsing when he talks is distracting. Maybe try it without the pulsing?
That salsa looks awesome!
I was hoping chef will get a puppie soon...
Nachos?
new video!!
Russian, Italian, Slovak, Portuguese, French, Spanish (Spain), English and Japanese subtitles are available. Thank you so much for the translations! :)  日本語、英語、ロシア語、イタリア語、スロバキア語、ポルトガル語、フランス語、スペイン語の字幕に対応しています！ Caption authors: haunted85 (Italian), Ken YEW (Spanish (Spain)), Lou Fox (French)
yummy
こんな豪華なサラダは初めて見ました！こんな美味しいそうなサラダがあるなら進んでパクパク食べちゃいそうです！特にお肉がフライパンで"ジュージュー"焼かれているところは、たまりませんでした♪(*´꒳`*)次回のタコスも楽しみにしています！
Who's the dog to left of Francis in the art?
That talking Francis at the corner tho.
完成した時のおばあちゃんの笑顔まじで眩しい
This looks yummy
Miss Francis🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾💞💫😞
I haven't watched cooking with dog in a while due to life. I get back and I find out Francis is gone 😓😢😭 I miss Francis 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 even though I found out now. Not only have I lost my dog in real life but now Francis 😭😭😭😭😭😭 Sorry for being selfish. I know his owner must be feeling worse. Whatever direction the channel goes I will support it!!!
OMG i haven't watched this channel in awhile .. someone please tell me .... what happened to Frances
Ugh Koriander =(
wow !
Wyd is dog? 😲😔
where is doggy :( he/she was so nicely just waiting and looking there :) sick or gone? if sick then i hope there is better days coming and if gone i shall pay my respect by cooking something seen from show
lovely
And wow.
yeah! 新しいビデオ.
woot
So delicious chef :)
As a Mexican, there is no such a thing as "TACO SALAD" wtf???
I haven't visited this channel in ages. Where's the pupper?? :o
Dear cooking with dog. I love all your videos very much :)) I often watch you make your tasty dishes and then politely ask my wife (from Kyushu) to make the same. Have you made any English dishes recently? Maybe cottage pie or shepards pie. Much love from the UK x
Where is francis?
Where is Francis?? 😕😿😿
where is the dog?
I hope this isn't to late but sorry about Francis, even if she died a year ago, I still feel sorry, but getting a new dog makes you feel better!!
Mmm, I am Mexican, and this dish does not look like meat for tacos nor is it traditional Mexican salad, the most popular meat for tacos is called "carne al pastor", and we usually accompany it with pico de gallo and salsa verde or roja, Tabasco sauce is NOT Mexican. Even so this dish looks so good, congratulations.
Look yummy!
今日ワンちゃんは？？
Although it doesn't stick to the traditional Mexican taco recipe, the "pico de gallo" salad main ingredients are the same as we use here: tomato, coriander, onion and green chilli, with a bit of green lime juice.  That salad can also be used as a topping for molletes: a bolillo bread (round white bread) sliced in halves, with smashed beans on top and gratinated cheese
When will u eat the dog
I am the only one who  tought than these Récipe is a taquito de pastor whithout tortilla?
As a Mexican, i know evrething in to a tortilla is a taco. BUT that Is not a tortilla. Just a chip. I know, this look delicious, but isn't a taco. May be "botana" 😄 by the way, salsa Tabasco is an offence!! All ingredients in salsa are good but no Tabasco.
Who is the other dog with the halo?
Im so sad Francis is not in the videos anymore.
nice video :)
Hey all!^^* We know this is your rendition of the recipes, but this is not a salsa, but a "pico de gallo" and there should be no Tabasco sauce, traditionally. Salsa is either ground up in a "mocajete" or pestle till pasty or you can mix it in a blender for a more saucy texture.  Most taco salad uses cheese of your choice. The meat does look tasty tho, so that is good what u put into it. Happy eating!^^*
Please make sure you put tex--mex or mexican in title, so people dont confuse one with the other, as a mexican chef thats something we try to erradicate
Can someone tell me how they put a talking francis on the apron?
Oy, where's dog?
guys wheres the dog i havent watched this channel for a while D:
Did the dog die?
Where is Francis????
The lipsyncing is weird and distracting.
My great grandma rolling around in her grave
As a mexican i could said it looks delicious...

I cant believe the poodle dies

انتي وفية
Taco Salad (Spicy Salsa and Taco Meat Recipe) | Cooking with Dog Francis: Hi, I am Francis, the host of the show, Cooking with Dog.  Chef:  Konnichiwa.  I’m always thinking about making tacos when green chili peppers are in season.  Today, we are making Taco Salad and will make tacos next time.  Francis: Let’s make the salsa.  Cut the coriander leaves into small pieces.  Chop up the stems.   Cut the green bell pepper in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and pith. Press it with your hands to flatten and chop it into fine pieces. As for the small green pepper cut it into small rings with the seeds attached.  If you don’t like the texture of the seeds you can remove them before cutting.  Now combine the diced tomatoes, chopped red onion, coriander leaves, green bell pepper, chopped garlic clove and green chili pepper.  Lightly toss to coat. To the mixture add lemon juice, salt, coarsely ground black pepper, extra virgin olive oil, and Tabasco sauce.  Toss to coat and chill the mixture in the fridge.Let’s make the taco meat. These are beef slices,  cut into bite-sized pieces.  Add the soy sauce, grated garlic clove, grated onion and tomato ketchup. Gently distribute the seasoning, then add the salt, chili powder blend, cumin seed powder, coriander powder and dried oregano leaves.  Add the coarsely ground black pepper.  Thoroughly mix the seasoning into the meat with your hand.  Finally add the olive oil.  Lightly toss to coat.
Now arrange the beef slices onto a pan.  Avoid overlapping the slices.  Turn the heat to medium.  When the meat is browned, flip it over.  Mmm.  This smells so good!  I love the sizzling sound.  When the other side is cooked, place it onto a plate. Overcooking makes the meat tough, so remove it quickly.  Pour the reduced sauce over the taco meat. And now let’s make the taco salad.
Place a generous amount of shredded lettuce leaves into a container.  Arrange the taco meat in four sections in a concentric pattern.  Place the salsa in between the meat.  Finally garnish the edges of the container with the tortilla chips.  Mmm.  It resembles the shape of a crown, doesn’t it?
This dish with all the colors will stimulate your appetite so we recommend using bright red ripe tomatoes. Chef:  This spicy salad goes great with cold beer especially on hot days. 
Francis: You can substitute a new onion for the red onion 
or add diced avocado which goes great with this salad.Good luck in the kitchen!
Oh my!, so this is what japanese people eat while thinking of México?...quite an american version I think...well, I am not sure, but sure is not seen in México...making japanese version of mexican food is quite... amusing. Do not not how that taste but I am sure is done with a lot of care ^.^u
Oh man, it's really creepy!! Or may be I just too western.
The apron is scary
Sorry but that Francis apron is really creepy. I understand it's probably heartbreaking to lose him, and Francis can't ever be replaced, but this is just weird and uncomfortable.
Sorry, I have to thumb down on this one.
I suggest puppiy
Will there be a puppy?
" I'm supposed to be in heaven now " dear Francis you are watching us from there right now I hope ~
"Mmmmmmm...this tastes like heaven. As a matter of fact, I'm supposed to be in heaven now. Good luck in the kitchen!"

It looks like rain.
omg the heaven comment at the end is actually making me cry i cant 😭
I just imagine he's still there shuffling his feet in excitement.
"In fact, I'm supposed to be in heaven now." I laughed so hard and then I cried
Francis lives on forever! So happy with new video!
that last line hit me right in the heart
I'm glad that Chef is doing well. Honest truth? I haven't wanted to watch the first "Cooking with Dog" episodes that didn't have Francis at all in them. In the one episode that I had seen, it looked like Chef was just barely hanging on and trying not to burst into tears. And it's like...why should I be watching this woman try to cook when she's so sad because her dog has died? 😢 But this showed up in my recommended vids again and I decided to watch this and see how Chef is doing. And I'm glad I did--I'm glad that Chef is doing much better now.
Francis is so cool that he gets a Hall Pass from Heaven to help continue making cooking videos! The Good Lord knows the importance of 'Cooking with Dog'.
Cartoon Francis is talking! How clever and cute!
Aww, that was so cute when cartoon Francis talked! I love cooking with dog 💖 the food looks so yummy and good and the videos are so nice and calming!
"Mmmm, this taste like heaven. As a matter of fact, I'm suppose to be in heaven now." 😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
A few seconds in I was confused with the animated Francis and then I saw the picture and I couldn't hold back my tears... It's been awhile since I've watched your cooking videos  but I've been a fan for years... this actually hurts..  I didn't know oh my god.. and just reading the comments.. Francis is watching over you in heaven now making sure he still helps with perfecting all your dishes, and just staying by your side always.. We love you.. <3
Thank you for posting! We missed you!
Made my day to see this video. Much love to you and francis. I hope you get another companion in the future.
The best thing about doggie heaven is that the dogs who go there can eat everything-all kinds of bones, meats, even chocolate without feeling sick. That means Francis gets to taste all of Chef's cooking even if it has onion or garlic inside ☺
I really miss Francis T-T
i just realized that the dog on her apron is talking
Francis is in heaven alright but he comes down just for us arigatou gozaimasu Francis sama
HE WAS THE GOODEST AND RAREST C H E F B O Y E
Looks delicious Chef! Hope you´re well
I'm so happy chef is still cooking, my cat died last year and then Francis died and I felt the same about Francis as for my own pet so I know how chef feels, I'm so glad she is continuing. that's what Francis would have wanted.
The dog on the apron who talk make me cry. It's so damn cute and sad at the same time. 1000 years of good life and fortune for all the people behind this show!
Cooking with Dog, I can't not say everything without crying, Francis is the great dog. He's is my favorite dog ever seen in my life, so do you. So sad because Francis is died. The greatest dog of the greatest chef is gone after 9 years. Cooking with Dog, may I bless Francis and hope you live over 100 year old so we can see your video ! #WeMissFrancis
Yay so happy they made a new video
I was wondering why I havent seen them post in awhile..sorry to hear about your dog
So glad to see Chef is doing well. We miss you Francis.
Hello Cooking with Dog! Always looking forward to your videos! Missed you guys!
とっても美味しそう！これはお腹空いている時に見るのはダメでした！でも、お肉がカットされている所は、もう一度見ます♪(*´ω`*)そして相変わらず笑顔も素敵♡両方お腹いっぱいで満足です♪(*´∇｀*)
Oh, no, that last bit.  My heart~!  Love you lots even after your passing, Francis, and chef as well <3
All about this channel is so cute. You are so cute chef and Francis will be always in our hearts.I loved the animated Francis.
glad to hear and see Francis still lives on😊☁💕
i miss you Francis!

i love gyukatsu but it's hard to find such good quality meat in here and it's going to be very expensive, unlike in japan... the dipping sauce is kinda different from the gyukatsu restaurant i like to dine at in tokyo, they give the wasabi-soy sauce, horse radish sauce (which is my fav) and sea salt. 

thank you for the recipe as always!
始めのシーンだけかと思ったら、調理中もフランシスがエプロンでおしゃべりしてる！かわいい！

フランシス「お母さん、今日はNG少なかったね」
Wow! That was adorable and the food delicious! It's great to see chef smile :) Francis is still there no matter what too!
"I'm supposed to be in heaven now" omg this is so sweet! Love this show
I was okay until the comment about heaven! sobs LOL, I'm so glad we can joke about it a little bit at least :) Recipe looks delicious!
最後のセリフうるっときました
フランシス見てるかな😢
Well, months after this sweet little doggy's life ended, I was finally able to watch a video with his voice without crying.


...Until the very end of it. ;_;
Can i join your family? Its okay, i'll do all the dishes♡
I love how Francis's little mouth moves awww. Dish looked so yummy! Need to try this recipe ☺️
Aww Francis... we missed you so much...
It is so good to see Chef smiling and laughing again! ;u;
You guys are doing such a great job! <3
I love this show, thank you for being awesome!
También  Ezio partió el 5 de marzo!
Se acompañan en el cielo!
Saludos
Here I was just expecting a cooking video and now I'm tearing up D: 
RIP Francis, forever a good boy
Francis reincarnated to chef's apron, so he's still cooking from heaven
I was so happy to see chef laughing and smiling in this video.
Much love!
I LOVE what you did with the apron! ;w; <3 What a sweet extra gesture. I was touched by the heaven comment too. 
God bless you, dear Francis~ <3 UvU
Glad to see chef smiling :) we miss you Francis 💕💕💕💕💕
Chef! I am so happy to see a new video from you. 
I still cook many of your recipies as they have made it in my recipe collection.
I miss Frances, but this was a very nice joke.
"I'm supposed to be in heaven now."

OH OKAY.
Chef eres maravillosa! Francis, no te olvidamos :')
francis' legacy will always live on!! ❤️
Guyyyssss, did you notice through out the video the francis on chef's apron was talking the whole time and blinking <3
Aw Francis I love you 😭 💕 great video
:'( I miss him too. thank you chef for such delicious recipe and always cooking with love for all of your followers
Damn it. This video is so bittersweet. Finally you start making good, uniquely japanese food again. But Francis? Oh, the feels!
That epic framed picture
ZOMBIE FRANCIS

Also I love the animated Francis idea! So cool and cute
I'm so sorry about Francis ): That makes me so sad
fantastic recipe - I'm always hungry after watching your videos
1:37 that wagyu steak...looks good enough to eat already if you know what I mean.

(+1 Internet point for getting the reference)
did the dog die???

the dog on her apron is speaking.. aww
My girlfriend and I used to watch this show alot, we are so glad that you are still continuing! Thanks for this amazing show! 😁😁
Chef thank you for this video, my heart goes out to you. I hope you and the team mends in your own time. <3
Nice one! I love gyukatsu and I've always wondered how gyukatsu was made. This is perhaps the very first video recipe of it too :D
Chef's smile at the end of the video <3 I think Francis, my poodle Fuffi and Loki (another famous dog) are in heaven and they play together. We never forget <3

Looks delicious as always ^o^ <3 love from Canada
Glad to see Ip man isn't just a good actor, but a fantastic cook. Well done.
Hi Chef. I have been watching your videos from years ago. I followed your recipe and started to cook by myself when I was living alone. I hope Francis is in a better place now. Thank you chef for the amazing videos!
Francis!! <3
Chef & Francis is one of the sweetest love on the internet that i know of.
Another delicious recipe from my favorite cooking show!  I'm in Heaven, too!   ;-)
I didn't realize that Francis was talking on the apron until this video lol
I love this!! Ahh thank you for continuing this channel. 💕
Nice to see that you've carried on Cooking with Dog.  Thank you for the pleasure of watching.
what are tears??? they're definitely not jumping out of my eyes
Love your videos. thank your so much. your recipes are great. I make one every Saturday when I go hiking.
ah, Ms. Chef's iconic bright smile returns! i'm so proud that she and the rest of the crew are still hardworking and making videos that teach us all about homemade Japanese food. good luck with all your future endeavors!
I'd love to try Wagyu beef when I'm in Japan 😍
I actually never travel outside my country, maybe I will someday
It's so good to see Chef again! I'm glad you are still making videos, and found a way to keep Francis's spirit in the show. ^^
I miss you Francis!
Thank you for making us happy and may you rest in peace.
Run free buddy!
I love you!
最後泣けました(T_T)フランシス～～！！！
that photo of francis really made my day... keep watch this channel from up there💗
you're in our hearts as well francis. We miss u. 🐾
I didn't notice the Francis on Chef's apron was talking ;_;
Tks Chef ... I'm very glad to see you ; )
I'm supposed to be in Heaven right now.

Right in the feelings.
Wait wait, I haven't been here in a while, been busy with life....Is Francis dead? I'm very concern....someone answer me...😕

Edit: Oh, no. I just looked through the videos. I'm sad.
This video brought me a lot of happiness during finals week. Thank you, Chef and Francis! ^-^
We miss you, Francis! I hope this series goes on and on!
the power of technology is awesome :D ahh francis we all remember you and love you
I never been so depressed while watching a cooking video. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you for making this video :) I missed you!
Wait I am just relized that chef's appron can talk during the cooking process... Lol
for the love of all that is holy NEVER COOK WAGYU beef, or any beef well done. at most medium well but never well done
Omg 😱  RIP Francis, we love you!

This looks delicious! Great video as always, I can't wait to try out your recipes when I move out ^^
I love you francis!!! Thank you chef for continuing to cook!
"l'm supposed to be in heaven now." lol aww <3
I never imagined that I would cry through an entire cooking video. From the moment I saw it was just a photo frame in his bed, all the way to the very end. I miss my dog, and Francis too.
Glad you're still making videos ;) great recipe :) I miss Francis :(
I wish you would make and release a "Cooking with Dog"-cookbook. I would honestly buy it immediately. I have made so many of these recipes - I love them!  <3

Your voice never forgotten ! :(
7 months of Sadness ;(
It's been well over a year and it still breaks my heart. But Francis will live on forever! I think he's been able to try every one of Chef-san's dishes in Heaven. ❤️
It's so wonderful to see Chef smile and laugh again!! I love the animated talking Francis ❤️
Been watching your channel ever since I was in high school. I always loved watching you and francis cook Japanese food and it always warms my heart seeing francis just there being a good dog. Now Francis is in heaven this tears me up ;--; I miss Francis.
francis will always be in our hearts ❤️
Man, I teared up bro! We love you Chef and Francis!
I remember eating this at Gyukatsu Motomura last summer! So good!
I'm happy to see Chef smiling and laughing! I hope you continue to feel happier each day! 😊

Rest in peace Francis, the best dog in the world.
The legacy should continue with a puppy of the same breed of Francis, so his legacy can live on in another. Is this selfish of me to say? Do not take offence please. 
I know you've lived an amazing life, Francis. May you be smiled upon for centuries. ❤️😭
The comment about heaven really pulled at my heart. We all miss Francis, but I am very proud of Chef for continuing her great work. がんばって！
😢heaven talk Francis at the end... WHY DON'T GOOGLE FUNDING TO CLONE FRANCIS THE DOG YOUTUBER, SO HARD TO WATCH COME ON... GO MAKE IT HAPPEN...!
I had to watch this video multiple times  because of Francis' cute facial expressions while talking!🐾❤🐾
So nice to see you well and smiling chef. You're an amazing lady. Much love from Malta!
Francis you will be missed :'( <3

"Gently place the steak into the oil"

This is adorable ❤️  I'm so happy you're back.
んー美味しそうー！
火の通り具合も最高ですね！
いつも素敵なレシピを紹介して戴き
ありがとうございます ´ω` )/
Chef, I'm so glad to see you getting joy from cooking again. We all love you so much. And, thank you for the happy tears Francis! Happy that you can make trips back over the Rainbow Bridge to cook with Chef again.
C'MON PEOPLE GET A GRIP ON! He's in a better place now, and YOU KNOW, he had a better life than many of us have, had or will have. Give him a rest, he has deserved it after all these years. Embrace instead all the wonderfull things he had left for us to cherish and enjoy. The joy of cooking, the recipes, our most experienced and gentle Chef...  and, if not the most important thing, his beloved voice :')
OH MY GOD FRANCIS:"( MY HEART HURTS.
I don't receive the notifications since months ago u.u I have to come here manually. PD: Buen vídeo XD
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one for Teishoku pleeeease...I'm a long time subscriber of your channel. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲
the ending, my heeeaaarrrttttt ;□;
Thank you for still making these awesome videos! We miss him too!
I am so happy to see another episode! Much love.
RIP sweet doggy!😥😇🐾🐩
CRIES I will always miss Frances, but I do hope that some day when the pain is less, they get a rescue dog to replace him.
I love how the apron is animated!  💕Too cute!!! I want a Francis cooking apron.
Its so damn hard to watch this channel anymore. I love chef but I feel like Francis was all of our dog and its like he was part of my family. Watching a vid without out him just makes me cry
I'm so glad the chef is smiling again. This recipe looks yummy!
Omg, this is my first time watching CWD in a while, and when I saw Francis's portrait, I lost it and I don't even know why...:(
Rest in peace Francis❤ you are missed by your viewers ❤
NOOOO WHY YOU SAY YOU ARE IN HEAVEN NOW?! I WAS FINE UP UNTIL THAT POINT 😭😭😭😭
I was laughing so hard because of his voice lmao
Even though he is no longer here, I hope they wouldn't replace him
おいしそー 家で作れるなんて
Im crying so much... rest in peace Francis
oishii!! 💛
I made this tonight with wagyu. It was wonderful. The fat from the beef rendered beautifully and the cook time was just perfect-medium rare. Really excellent.
Can You Guys Make Isobe-age?? I may or may not spell it right but it's delicious
Francis, one of us forever :) !
oh my, for whoever animated francis in the apron, you are amazing.
Looks absolutely delicious! Glad to see we're still getting videos from you and that you're doing well!
I knew it was coming cause I read the comments but I still wasn't prepared for Francis's comment at the end 😭
I just notices Francis  (on chief's apron ) is talking. 😲
the heaven joke hit me harder than it should have and now I'm going to go lay down and think about dogs and cry.
damn that last line broke my heart
I have a bad feeling when i see that framed picture,.... And it turna out to be true T_T,

bye francis

Now this is "cooking with astral dog" channel
thanks for the new video. gyukatsu was the perfect choice for the come back. it looks really good.
I don't know how she's really holding up, but on the outside, Chef seems to be doing better now. This makes me happy, I was worried about her. 
I also love the new addition with the animated Francis apron, and his wit at the end of the video. It's as if he's still here, it's such a wonderful way to pay homage to him while also continuing his legacy in a new way! 

I love Cooking with Dog, and even if it may not be exactly what it used to be because of Francis's physical absence, that doesn't mean that it isn't a fantastic show and that Chef isn't incredible. I still hope she continues on, and I will be here to support her! :>
I'm so happy to see chef smile. Losing a loved one is hard. She's so strong.
Thanks Chef. Looks good. Sadly, Wagyu is very expensive, but I think I will treat myself to some soon.
Chef is looking a lot happier now. I'm glad.
The name of this show is very misleading. Although the recipes look pretty good.
OH NO!! Francis!!!!
thanks for taking a break from heaven to teach us how to cook!
Chef looks so happy! :)
Love u all! Keep up the great work.
omigod this actually made me sooo hungry
THAT WAS NOT A GREAT TRANSITION TO SAY THAT FRANCIS DIED BECAUSE I AM IN SHOCK AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE WHAT THE ACTUAL
AWWWLEEV OIIUL (no hate)
FRANCIS!!!!!! Rest in peace!! We all miss you!!!! TT^TT
I'm done. I cried when I realized Francis crossed the rainbow bridge ... my dad will be so upset about this. :-( Francis was and still is a rockstar!
As soon I watched this I was so happy chef is back
That photo of Francis in his basket made me cry.  Miss you little sweetie
Francis is forever lived in our hearts and in the kitchens of many. Looking forward to the next one.
I'm still being the teen center staff to make sushi! And thank you for helping me cook!
it looks heavenly.  it's so nice to see a new video and little francis visiting us.  great looking recipe and results.
the moment I saw the picture frame, I already know what will happen next
RIP Francis 😭😭😭😭
i just can say she's adorable ❤
We miss you Francis!!!
Oh gosh I first tried this in Taiwan at a Japanese restaurant 2 months ago and indeed I had to take a queue number because it was so long!!! I couldn't really remember what happened that night after dinner because I got drunk on beef. 😂😂😂 Thank you Chef and Francis for demonstrating how easy it is to make this at home. ❤❤❤
Seeing Chef smile makes me smile. ^_^
Omg I never would have thought a cookin show could have so much feels. I winced at the picture of Francis and my heart throbbed at his heavenly statement at the end. I can't deal with this right now but I'm glad this channel is still up and running. I love Cookingwiththedog!
My heart. I can't take it.
i just realized Francis is talking on her apron through the entire video
This looks like art ♡
I had this when I was visiting Asakusa, truly delicious
no wonder they stop making video for so long. :(
This is super bittersweet! I'm so happy she's going to continue making videos but... but.... manly tear rolls down face.
Thank god for subtitles
Omg Francis died?  😭😭 i havent been watching this channel lately and I just found out Im soo depressed about it 😭😭😭😭 rest in peace Francis ❤️
What the--WHAT??! I didn't realize Francis on the apron was animated until I saw the mouth and eyes move. Super cute! (I really thought my eyes were playing with me 🤥😄)
I started to cry my eyes out the second I saw the picture and not Francis. They taught me how to cook! Rest well Francis....
it still breaks my hearts that francis is no longer sitting there 😢
Go chef! Go! Francis live for us forever! I like a lot your smile! make me so happy! :D
Animated Francis is adorable! I'd love to see him in an anime or have his own animation on the side of the video giving you advice for the recipe of the video!
Oh Chef, you are too precious. You seem like the best Grandma ever. Your cooking always makes me think, though. In America, a steak that size is a "snack". Its no wonder we have a weight issue.
I love that they continued the series in its honor~
that last line from francis though xD
I was so happy to see your video, I missed you.
Francis' photo ;u;
I had this in Gyukatsu-Motomora in Shibuya it was heaaaaaven
Looks so tasty!! Oh Francis! Of course you're in heaven! Thank you Chef!
Francis will always been in every kitchen as he watches us all 😢
I just noticed that apron-Francis moves while talking. I love it!
Love you chef <3
I'm so happy that she is still sharing her recipes with us :D
Soon will be Francis and owner photos on this Chanel cooking. And replace with sexy young woman. Or handsome guy.
Soon will be Francis and owner photos on this Chanel cooking. And replace with sexy young woman. Or handsome guy.
This dog gets me nervous lol
I love how the dog (on the apron)'s mouth moves. 😊
Awwww 😊💕
Chef we all love you so much!
Chef, stop being so damn cute!!! ❤️
rest in peace Francis YouTube will never forget you
I havent watched in a while I cant believe Francis is gone. RIP Francis!
please don't ever stop this show, I enjoy it very much! the last line made me tear up a little bit, be a good boy in heaven, francis!
<3 <3 <3 <3
</3
I am really happy to see chef smiling at the end of the video, I know she was really sad about Francis. Thanks a lot for the new recipe, the plate looks delicious. I preffer my meat a little bit more cooked so I will take your advice. ♡♡♡
Awww Francis is in heaven? 
rest in peace ♡🐩😇
This video made me so happy! Thank you!
The animated talking apron, I thought my eyes got problem but awww cute!! Well Francis, miss you.
Does anyone else notice that francis is talking on chef's apron? Such an amazing way to keep francis around!
Haven't watched this video in years and come back to see this... rip francis ma boi
Chef you're looking like you're feeling a little bit better about everything!
im not crying, it's just been raining, on my face
Will cooking with dog ever get a new host?
とても美味しそうです！
これからも頑張ってください。
応援してます。
Ninjas cutting onions everywhere...
WHEN DID FRANCIS DIE WHAT !! I DONT WATCH FOR A WHILE AND HELL BREAKS LOOSE
Dangit, I thought I was okay to watch the new episodes, but I couldn't make it past the first 30 seconds without tearing up. I gave myself time, I didn't watch new episodes, I thought I was strong enough!!!
見たわかる美味しいヤツやん(´◉ω◉` )
haha this video is on trending #21!
the apron talks, so cute
Love the apron animation! Nice looking steak
what, francis is passed away? RIP.
That looks so yummy 😋
All dogs don't go to heaven....






Except for Francis!
only now do I realize the apron-Francis has a moving mouth !!
I miss Francis 😭😭😭😭
Glad to see you back, chef!
so glad you guys are continuing with this channel
I miss Francis😭
Its great seeing you again
I thought I was seeing things when I saw Chef's apron blink, how clever! Francis will always be with us now haha
gotta love Francis!
Why this lady is so adorable? My poor heart!
Beef is expensive in Japan, so this is definitely a treat! :-)
This is getting kind of creepy.
we love you, Chef!!!
I honestly wonder how sweet Mirin is supposed to be (If at all?). They call it a sweet rice wine, but that might just be a misnomer, or just used to describe the sugars in the starch being broken down to make the alcohol...  I'm using a version of Kikoman mirin, and I can never taste or tell if it's in my sauces...
Their name is so good 😂
Francis speaks from heaven! Fun video!
Legit haven't watched their videos in so long. So, I come back and this freaked me out a little. Atleast you guys are holding up well since his departure.
I couldn't stop staring at apron francis talking the entire video O_O
damn ninjas cutting onions 😭
OMFG dont animate  francis again ITS TIME TO STOP
Next episode is cooking Francis. JK Francis will be missed.
Awwww Francis passed away?  I'm so bummed out now.  Been with this channel since it started so many years ago...  depressing.  Hope they find another pup soon.
I like the apron!
prayers for doggo
I don't understand. She was laughing and smiling all the video, why did she do that? Yes, I'm also sad, but you shouldn't smile, if you're not happy😔
Sorry for mistakes, I learn English
I must think of you more often Chef! I wondered just this morning if we would be seeing you and our beloved Francis soon. And here you are! 💖 💖 💖 
Wonderful to see you, no matter how seldom.  
Jenn 💖
エプロンのフランシス動いてたんですね。凝ってるなあ！
Oh Francis! You came down from heaven simply for a piece of steak, right?
Oh my God the creator of this video worked so hard to make the graphic/cartoon Francis talk! I hope it wasn't too time consuming for you. If it was, please don't feel the need to add such animation in the future :)
Francis goodbye to you our friend.
Dang I'm crying
tHIS LOOKS SO GOOD
love you guy's!!!  maybe a new puppy named Francois?
I havent started the video, and I havent even watched your channel, but I lost my dog. You didnt eat him did you?
Francis.... 😭
So sorry about Francis.  You are amazing!
Can you make Tori Katsudon
I miss you Francis
omg this is getting a bit of creepy..... a picture of frances?
I found this channel because Steven universe made a reference to it
Awww, Francis we miss you!
Sometimes it looks like Apron Francis is raising one eyebrow as he speaks. Cute touch!
oh my god Francis is gone... Rest In Peace my little host
Francis! se extraña su presencia, recuerdo cuando se le antojaba lo que cocinaban! 🐶❤
It's been nearly a year, and the "I'm supposed to be in heaven" still gets to me.
So happy to see her smiling still.
excellent as always, Chef!
It looks delicious and relatively easy to make. I'll try this soon. Thank you!
OMG.... i didnt know why you hadnt uploaded the video.... I hope Francis is safe and happy at heaven.
Francis will be in mine mind forever. T-T
People eat well done wagyu?
Aww, I'm so terribly sorry to hear about Francis's passing. That is one dog that will greatly be missed, but at least his spirit is still alive and strong in the kitchen where it counts, and the memories of him will always run strong within our hearts. Despite the tragic news, I'm still glad to see new episodes of Cooking with Dog.
I still have a hard time watching the new videos ever since Francis passes away. But thank you very much for the recipe chef, it truly looked delicious. They started selling Wagyu beef at the supermaket, so I'll definitely try this out!
Were there onions in this recipe? because I'm tearing up a little...
after so long，finally
Francis is talking on the apron! <3
O no what happened to dog?
nooo francis ily :C
AS A MATTER OF FACT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE IN HEAVEN NOW UGH MY HEART
OH MY GOD FRANCIS NO
idk why im tearing
wow!!! the apron can talk!!! 😱😱😱
Glad to see you smiling again, chef. I'm certain Franscis is enjoying delicious food in the next world right now as well.
OH MY GOD nooooo I just came back to visit your channel today and found out about Francis 😢😢😢 I'm so sorry for your loss! RIP Francis! Miss you!
That is simply delicious!....Oh! i miss Francis :(
im all fired up now!
OMG THE APRON SPEAKS
That was a lot of wasabi for one bite! Either way, this looks delicious!
<3
<3
Love the talking Francis apron!  It makes me happy and it's a nice touch!
welcome back ...
awwww Francis!!! so clever
pleas make makaron
Lovely to see you Chef!
I like the talking dog it's cute, but may I suggest you try a Green apron then you could try to green screen the animation so it doesn't look so off and on, and don't having to worry about stopping it when her arm moves.
PLS FRANCIS THE FEELS
I had no idea, I took a long break from my YouTube viewing. I will always love you Francis and Chef!
Jesus I saw the end of the title and I didn't look at the channel name.
i love ypu francis!!!
Oh no that last sentence :( my heart
;n; poor Francis
I would love to try this with wasabi. It's hard to get wagyu meat here. 👨‍🍳👍😊
So now they post monthly?? 😭😭😭😭
Will we have Francis Jr?
Even now im crying
😭😭😭😭 I'm so sad. He passed away WAHHHH.
I'm so happy that you guys are still making videos.
Can u make chuka idako in your next video pls
Still miss Francis my love....

RIP Francis x

這殺小英文哈哈哈
So cute how Francis on the apron is animated to talk 😊
my vision is blurry from the tears
I watched a video from this channel a year ago, and now I come to watch it again but the dog turned into an ipad
why I'm crying?
RIP Dogey
Great recipe! 👍🏻
Cook such a steak well done is a crime! D=
Chef, I'm one of many fans who have been a fan of your channel for many, many years. Having learned as much as I have from both you & Francis, and having watched Francis's health decline over the years, I was sad to think that CWD might be over after Francis passed....yet here you are. Still at it. Still laughing. Still cooking. You're a wonderful and strong person to continue making videos for us to enjoy even without our 4-legged narrator. <3
I have not watched cooking with dog in a long time so to come back to this brought tear to my eyes. Will miss and forever love Francis ♡♡
all was well until he mentioned he's suppose to be in heaven.
I love you, Chef.
i cried so much watching this.
...why am I here?
Yaassssssssss
I used to watch this channel a long time ago and today I remembered about this channel so I came back to it and I literally just just realized that Francis past away I think I'm gonna cry
I am really hungry, it looking very yummy.
Francis 😢😢😢
ohmygod. The memorial picture is so bittersweet.

Francis 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The animation on the apron and the picture of Francis on the dog bed almost made me cry
CHEF> I LOVE YOU
SOBBING AT THE HEAVEN COMMENT!!!!!
i hope francis is eating very well in heaven right now
The look on chef's face as she's eager to try it. Well, that's a very expensive 3cm thick cut of meat.
I'm so happy a new video is out!
what is mirin and is it a type of vinegar?
oh my gosh francis died?😭
I'm soo sad to hear about Frances. But I know he's warm and happy and comfortable now. Thank you for sharing him with us for all these years. I feel like I grew up with him (started watching in my late teens and now I'm in my late 20's). Please keep making videos for as long as you can :)!
i miss francis and gabe
Francis is everything that is right about the internet.  Thank you.

I'm sorry to hear about Francis. When I saw the animation I thought it was cute, but then I saw the picture. :( Sorry for your loss.
That is just too sad omg
I haven't watch this channel in a while, what happened to the dog?

久し振りに動画を見ました。フランシスが喋ってる！
牛レアカツ、見てるだけでお腹が減ってきます。
串がどのタイミングで刺されたかわからないのですが（この状態で売っているものだったらすみません）、レアで食べるときは食中毒を防ぐために、串は刺さないほうが安全だと思います。老婆心ながら！
Hi chef, i went to visit a japanese friend the other day and she gave me a curry soup that was very delicious, can you teach us how to make it? thank you!
わんちゃんは？
why dont they get a new dog and stay with the image of francis
Francis 😢
I'm really sorry, that apron is so kawaii!! But when Francis talks, it's......really scary.
Of course Francis is in heaven. He's a great dog
Mmmmm that marbling on that steak!!
😭😭
Uh excuse me these are half-cooked and red in the middle. Not Kosher at all.
now this show has horror-vibe to it... how do we hear francis if he's dead??
What can I use instead of merin?
We love you Francis!
oh no Francis died!? 😭
とてもおいしそう！　や手みたいですよね。本当に　ケーキ・フラワーを使いますか？それもやってみたいです。
NOOOOOOOOOO, so sad
I took me almost 7 years to find out that the dog was the narrator...
can you show us how to make shrimp fried rice
take care! rip Francis!
i havent seen cooking with dog in ages and when i saw the picture of Francis and no Francis I panic like " what? What! Where is he where is he?! Maybe hes sick or grooming idk" And i saw the news. RIP Francis.
I just notice that the Francic printed on the apron is talking ☺️ So cute ❤️️❤️️❤️️
🐶
I just noticed that the Francis on her apron was animated the whole time.
Is there a possibility cookingwithdog could get a new host? A shiba inu maybe?
Is it ok to get another dog... it doesn't mean replacing him. It's ok to not get one at all though, it's fine.
dear cooking with dog, 
I have always loved watching your videos and have watched nearly every one of them. I've used your potato salad recipe from the bento box video as well as the watermelon shaved ice (which everyone loved). Francis inspired me to keep cooking and to love every minute of it. My dogs like to be what I call the clean up crew when I drop something on the floor. Thanks again for creating a channel that inspires people to cook and may Francis rest easy.
From a fellow cook and dog lover ❤❤❤
:O
Francis joined the late greats
This video is #34 on trending!
Talking Francis apron is too cute.
i need dog apron like that
seeing his picture in the bed instead of him brought me to tears instantly. rest in peace little cutie.
I miss Francis.. 😢
That talking apron....
oohhhhhh Francis....T.T
yummy!!!
Oh he passed I'm so sorry
I miss Francis 😢😢😭😭
i didnt know he died already.. :(
Omg how cute is this video!!!!
わんちゃんはどうされたのか...
I wonder how long it will take until i can see these videos without feeling heartbroken
Get a new doggu
I cried
I LIKE BUTTON! I LIKE BUTTON! YES!
It's raw though
I'm sorry but with that title I thought this video was about cooking dog
This is why i dont start with indian street food video's, i always end up here
おいしソース
anyone else notice the francis apron animation??
Remove the seaweed after half a day means remove it after 12 hours? Cos a day is 24 hours.
When did you die, Francis???!!
Anyone else notice her shirt is narrating this?
i hope.chef could get new.dog
This looks so delicious!!!
The dog on her apron is moving
The dog on her apron is moving

フランシスは居ないのですか？
確か、昔の動画では椅子に座って居たと思うんですが...
woww
Хэй,ロシア人,кто тоже сидит и ничего не делает, и наедается взглядом 😙
the cartoon Francis talking is such a nice tribute. I'm sure he is in heaven watching and shuffling his feet
Hi!

ITTSSSSSSS RAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Who else came here because of the thumbnail.
What happens to the dog???
huh. it's raining again.
Poor dog I just knew that he died
When did the dog on her apron get animated!!!
For the sauce is it cooking sake, or alcohol sake?
Is Francis dead?!
Who's been cutting up onions in here?
were is francis
How did he die?
highkey surprised that she hasnt cooked the dog yet
Talking Francis on the apron is weird.
カナダでホームステイしたところのお母様が私につくって！とライスボウルの動画をみせてもらってから楽しませてもらってます！
美味しそうですー！！
I'm sorry your dog died, It's hard losing a member of a family.
はじめて見たけど.......これって...本当に英語なの????全然わからない.....
Wait what happened with the dog?
Really impressive effect to have the cartoon lip sync the whole time, but I have to be honest, it's a bit weird and very distracting. Sorry!
DU BIST Super  ....Nice.....Bon Appetit...🐩🐩🐩💙💚💛
Francis is Dead ???? o.O
what happened to the dog?
He died?!
This is so much better than chicken fried steak.
The real reason why the dog is in heaven is because she added it to the menu.
is the dog dead?
犬死んだの？
What is this....
Rest in peace Francis. 👼🐩🐩🐩🐩
I like the cartoon of franis talking on her apron on.
Francis diedddd???!!!
まかろんつくてくだす
ガンバレ
Is Francis dead?? Seriously? What happened? When?
I just noticed the cartoon dog on her apron is talking. . .
Oh my goooood!!!!! Francis is dead!!!!! ????
WAIT WHATTTT........HE DIED. IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THIS CHANNEL AND FRANCIS DIED. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
また元気なフラリンシス君に会いたいです(;_;)
私も、10才になるチワワと2日以上離れた事がない位20代の一人暮らしから今の実家にいるまでずっとずっーと一緒でした。
今もフラリンシス君は虹の橋からお母さんや視聴者さんを見守ってくれてますね。
フラリンシス君、長い間ありがとう❤その可愛らしい仕草に笑顔は動画を観ればいつでも会えますね。

quien habla español aqui
wait,,, did the dog die!!!?!?!? OMG whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
what happen with the dogs
let it sit to cuu 😂😂😂😂
who else was dying thru the video
This channel is slowly dying without frequent uploads... :'(
But did you cook a dog?
I recommend changing your Channel Name... There's two meaning to "Cooking with dog". And the Asian part of me takes offense...
Francis will keep on milking the forced emotions off some viewers & material profits even after the Japanese woman dies...
They loved francis so much that they didn't excluded him from the show, this is so beautiful, respect to them! Rip francis, i'll miss you. 😢💖
Chef talked to the picture of Francis at the end...MY HEART.
"Francis, the delicious dessert is ready!" 
I cried
THAT LITTLE ANIMATION ON THE APRON IN THE BEGINNING WAS SO CUTE
I'm so happy to see you back Chef!! Please take care of your health and share your amazing recipes whenever you can :)
It feels so bittersweet. I feel sad about Francis as I watch this 🙁, but at the same time, I'm overjoyed that the show is back and chef is showing us these great recipes. I've been waiting for this 🙂
I swear I'm not crying....Awww chef! welcome back!
im dumb, i thought the picture was actually francis 😥
I hope chef reads all the good comments so she will know how much so many people care about her and miss Francis. Can't wait for the next video!
The Francis on Chef's apron talked almost the whole time! So coool!!!
I get so excited when I see you've uploaded again! remember that we love you, chef
We love you chef!!!!! It's so nice to see you smiling again, and I bet Francis is wagging away seeing you are still going for him! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ he's probably happily following along now with every recipe, because in puppo heaven, there's nothing a sweet puppo can't eat!
I love how the Francis on Chef's apron was animated the whole time.
My Heart!
Who knew Green Tea Mochi Desserts had chopped onions in them

Chef, it is so good to see you back! I have missed your videos.

I also miss Francis back when he was sitting quietly on the bench. At the same time, the animation on your apron is a good reminder that he is still here with us. What a way to carry him in our hearts (apron) ^_______^
Rip francis, I'll miss you
Chef ! please Take care your health too
I broke down so much at the end when she talked to Francis, I'm literally falling apart so so sad I hope he didn't suffer and I'm sure he had a wonderful life with such great companions! RIP Francis <3333

Is mochiko the same as glutinous rice flour?
When she talked to the picture of Francis at the end....my heart....
My wife and I love your show and Francis very much. Love from Florida, USA ♡♡♡
I'm very happy to see your video! I'm going to eat some dagashi but very far from Japan. I will look forward to trying this recipe! Thank you
Francis may be gone, but his voice still caries on....
Yummy! ^-* I'm so gonna make those, thank you so much for sharing! Please continue to make your lovely videos. :) All the best wishes
Seeing Chef smile makes me smile too inside and out.  I'm guilty when it comes to sweets!
I'm so happy to see you're continuing the show! I'll be trying to make these soon.
Just in case you want it in cups:

50 g Sweet Rice Flour mochiko = 0.31 cups
1 tbsp Granulated Sugar
80 ml Water = 0.33 cups

1 tsp Matcha Green Tea Powder
Water

100 g Red Bean Paste anko 
100 ml Heavy Cream = 0.43 cups
1/2 tbsp Granulated Sugar
the next recipe looks amazing too, can't wait! ＼（○＾ω＾○）／
Looks great chef, and you make it look so easy :-)
I havent watched in probably about a year, and seeing Francis' picture in their dog bed.............. I'm crying
SOMEONE PLS GIVE THIS LADY A POODLE PUPPY PLS I WANT HER TO BE HAPPY AND THE FRAMED PICTURE OF FRANCIS IN THE DOG BED IA MAKING ME CRY
Hello, Chef :) Thank you for the recipie. I'm wondering if there is a way to make this without a microwave for those of us who don't have one. Thank you! :D
it's nice he wasn't just replaced with some other dog. Nice way to keep the show going
I will remember Francis fondly, as I have watched this show since its beginning so many years ago. It's kind of hard to believe.
Rip Francis you sweet little doggy <3
we grieved for Francis long enough. it's time for a new dog!
francis :( you were well loved by all of us watchers over the years
フランシスお亡くなりになったんですね(´･ｪ･`)
The animated apron is such an adorable idea! I was so surprised by it and think it's a great way to integrate the narration to something visual again. It's the spirit of Francis! <3 It's so good to see you making videos, the daifuku looks so delicious!
I just subscribed and suddenly francis is dead :( broke my heart :(
welcome back chef!!!💕💕💕
Chef your smile is beautiful it warms my heart,  I admire your strength ❤️
i'll miss francis SOOOOO MUCH... we've (me and my mom) been a fan since 2011 rest in peace francis!!
im crying rn cuz shes talking to the picture just like she would he talking to the real Francis ;-;
"Francis, the delicious dessert is ready!" isn't it also traditional to put mochi down at a shrine to honour a dead person? Was the mochi for Francis? My heart ;_;
Big Mum probably loves Daifuku.
didnt even realize that francis was a picture
love you chef,thank you for continue sharing recipes with us.
Awwwww this is sad, so Francis is dead but I am glad they didn't replaced him. R.I.P Francis
初めて見させてもらいました！抹茶クリーム大福、とても丁寧に作られていて美味しそう！私も真似して久しぶりにお菓子作りしてみようかな(*´꒳`*)
i believe in after life and I know you will see Francis again. I also had a cat, and sometimes, but rarely I see her in my dreams telling me she is fine and to not be scared :> this planet is more complicated than we know, has secrets that we still haven't discovered yet. for example, lately scientists discovered that plants can read people's minds and have feelings. every thing is possible, so continue to believe in that and be positive. when you are happy, good things happen.
so I believe you shouldn't be sad, enjoy your life, do what you like, continue to cook :> people love you for what you created with this channel, you are not alone even if you don't know us, you and Francis created something beautiful, that will continue to be like that even after. in my tradition the souls of the ones we love sometimes visit us.  and the first 40 days stay in that home and travel around the places he/she liked.
we thank you, you are an amazing team and we will continue to watch your videos like always :3 take care
The animated apron Francis is very cool! Oh! Just noticed It's animated in most  of the video! Nice touch! (view in full screen to apreciate the effect) 
Having the picture of Dog is sad, time for a poodle puppy.
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE
oh my gosh Francis I miss you! So cute he is still included in the show...even though it made me cry a bit :(
This is wonderful and makes me sad at the same time. Hope you guys are okay!
rip doggo 2k17
I really enjoy your videos! Thank you for making them! ^_^
The accent is intimidating and funny. But since the food looks delicious, I guess it's fine.
When she talked to francis I just-----wipes tears
thank you for uploading! i've missed this channel :)
I was thinking about this series today, I'm so glad it's still being done!
Chef! We missed you! ❤❤❤
Chefさんは元気そうです！(; v ;)
AHHHH THANKS CHEf and the people or other persons involved in this for lovely recipes videos, and keeping francis ❤️
Awwww this video just made my day. My fave YouTube channel. So good to see you back, chef. You look well and happy 😊 Please let us see you more often. And this is one of my favourite desserts which I never imagined I could make it at home! 😮 Definitely will try when I get a chance. Love this so so much! Thank you so much!
My condolences to you for your lost loved one. How old was Francis? I know we will miss our feline when he passes on, turned 18 this past June and is starting to show it. :(
I never clicked so fast on a cooking video till now. But I'm so glad your back chef~❤
THEY MADE THE FRANCIS ON THE APRON LIPSYNC I'M CRYIGN
FRANCIIIIIIIISSSSSSSS  (´；д；`)
This channel suddenly became very sad to watch...I miss Francis, when Chef spoke to the photo I couldn't hold in my tears, thank you for continuing to upload recipes and have Francis appear as a cute little animation. 
I will always support Cooking with Dog.
とても美味しそうです(^^)
次の動画も楽しみにしています。
これからも頑張ってください。
Mam, that's not a real dog next to you
I go nuts for daifuku although I never tried to make them. This looks so delicious. I might try to make some soon.  Thanks, Chef!
I was fine through the whole video, but as soon as she looked at the picture of Francis and spoke to him, I was in tears. Wow, my heart.
I am always so excited to see you upload, but then I get so sad because I remember Francis passed away.
welcom back ! I miss you and Francis
Looks delicious can't wait to make it at home 💕💕💕
とても美味しそうです💞

Poor Francis I loved him so much he was what made my day
FrancisT^T
Thanks for uploading again! Support!
Please do a video on crepe cake please! ❤️
i think she should get a new dog so she wont feel so lonely ._. it must pain her to make these videos or i would think it would
and here I am thinking of jimin
oishi ^^
Im not crying youre crying 
what a great way to honor francis 😭
OMG I CRIED the picture of francis got me ;_;
i know he did but..... sometimes its like francis never died.... sometimes i feel like i can hear in voice in every new video i watch................😔
The animation on the apron is cute!! It's a really nice idea! :D
美味しそう💛抹茶大好きです！
So glad you're back!!! <3
Thank you, Chef! I love japanese delicacies and matcha very much, and it makes me very happy to see you post this video. Love you! 💕
I really liked the apron animation but it´s really hard to see. You could use a green apron as a green screen and animate Francis on it. Or maybe have a 3D modelled Francis sitting on the cushion.
cries in a intense way cuz he doesn't see Francis for 2 years WHYYYYYYYYYY ;A;
Thank you for posting chef! I'm looking forward to trying this recipe!
yay!! another video. 😍 love the apron! are you selling it? would love to have an apron with Francis!
I'm so sorry but Francis is dead...you need to get a new puppy or stop cooking with a dead Francis....I loved him
I like it but I also feel this is a little bit creepy as an obsession... don't think me wrong, I love what you did there but it's a too much for me.
I cried ; ;
The peak of this woman's exposure in the culinary world is in second place to a dog.
暑い日は葛切りや蜜たっぷりのフルーツ寒天が美味しそうですね。
I'M CRYING... OH, FRANCIS!
The end where chef told Francis that the dessert was ready was so sweet yet sad. Francis will always be missed. 😢
Almost can't finish the whole video....The animation is really a brilliant idea. RIP Francis, we miss you.
😭😭😭 when she talks to Francis at the end
hell yes I need the subtitles, lol.
thank you very much!
YAY!!!
NOOO WHEN SHE SPOKE TO FRANCIS I CRIED
who came from Steven universe short?
cooking with lion?
they put in the effort to animate Francis on her apron and how the chef still talks to his picture. I'm not crying
本当に笑顔に癒される…可愛い…
I miss this show! Much love from Canada!
They should get a similar dog to Francis and call him Francis II
멍멍이 어디갔어요....ㅠㅠㅠ
such a sweet lady, it's good to see that you're still making videos.

The guy talking reminds some sooooo mutch of "run for the cube" here on YouTube
hi 
I made the mochi but the dough was tearing apart despite the good texture of it.
what is the reason?
thanks
Chef ❤❤❤❤❤
Welcome back chef! We missed you!
I don't think we will ever get over the death of Francis :(
I wish we wouldn't bring it up so much but it's hard when we miss him.
my heart😢😢
I don't like daifuku, but I think I will enjoy this.
まだまだシェフの表情がたまに辛そうな時が垣間見れるので、こちらも胸が痛くなります😢
同じ高齢犬を飼っているので、なかなかすぐには立ち直れないですよね。
でも天国で心配しない様にと気丈に振る舞うシェフを応援します。
お盆さんでフランシスも帰って来てるのかな？
フランシス……(￣^￣゜)
Awww :')
I just found out about Francis passing. :( I've been crying for 30 minutes now. :'(
YAY!!!!
フランシス〜〜〜😭
we love you Francis  ❤ 🐶
I try so much to like red bean paste. I love the taste, but the texture of the bean skins is always just too much for me to tolerate.
That photo frame of Francis :(
OMG THE TALKING APRON IS SO ADORABLE! I LOVE THAT!
im so sad rn , francis is gone , after seeing the woman looking at francis and saying that the dessert is ready , i broke down ;-;
It's so good to see you Chef !
I don't even like daifuku, but I liked Francis and I like this video.
もうフランシスが動いてる姿が見れないの悲しすぎ
Francis' spirit lives on. ❤
Rip dog tho
I was just wondering how to make these the other day! Thank you!

私はすでにフランシスを見逃していた。
わぁぁ、おいしそう！絶対に今週作る。

This makes me so sad because they still have a picture of him :(
The cream, the anko, the finished daifuku looked yummy. Everything was fine until chef talked to francis (the photo) then... T.T
Miss you lovely Francis, the recipe is amazing! Thank you cheff!
I was worried this channel wouldn't make videos anymore! Seeing this made my day! Hope your well Chef! Francis will never be forgotten.
RIP Lovely Francis :'(
Chef, can I use regular rice flour ( not sweet )? And is there a way to cook it without using microwave?
I love matcha. I love daifuku. I love red bean. I CANNOT WAIT TO MAKE THIS 😍🤤
i love your dog want to eat your dog happy days
Thank you Chef for teaching us. :)
I cried for her when she spoke to Francis at the end. She must miss him so much
I used to watch this show when I was little 😢 I miss lil Francis

EARLY!
One Piece.
ok no one said a cooking video could make ppl cry ;-;
I ate it and it is so good!!!
I've eaten a lot of mochi lately, so I'll definitely try this. Only I'll try it with a different flavor; I can't get myself to like matcha. It tastes like burnt tea and coffee.

I hope she will continue to give us amazing recipes. We will miss Francis.
Love cooking with dog

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I JUST CAME BACK TO THIS CHANNEL AFTER A FEW YEARS HOW CAN THIS BE
This looks so scrumptious!
Does anyone know if they'll be getting another poodle to, not replace Francis, but pick up the mantle? :) I'd be nice to have a little protege in his stead.

😭
francis spirit is now lay on an apron

The music reminds me of sweet Martha's cookie jar
where is francis nakamura ?
im very sad francis is gone...
FRANCIS
The photo brings me such happiness
A beautiful dessert! Though I must ask, what's the difference in using potato starch instead of cornstarch or more mochiko to prevent the mochi from sticking?
i am so mesmerized by the apron 😂 so cute♡♡♡
miss Francis! but I still love your videos!!
I just want to hug Chef, she seems so kind ❤❤
I love Francis!
😢 ill enjoy this matcha in memory of Francis
:') glad to see another video.
When she talked to the picture, I got really sad DDD:
how do you make this without a microwave... I don't own one by choice.
5:22 come on chef,don't make me cry please T︵T. my eyes are already watering
This channel is so depressing now :(
OMG. FRANCIS DIED??? D:
yaaaay a new video :D
I cannot believe Francis is gone..... RIP sweet Francis..
I want to make mochi!
Goodbye Francis
this is my first time at this channel and I thought the dog was real, things quickly turned sour when I realized it was just a picture, but I'm sad because I was thinking I was about to watch a dog prepare ice cream
わんちゃんどうしたの！？
What a lovely way to remember Francis!!
I'm going to make this for my mom. She will love it! Francis apron is really cool!
TT_TT
Another delicious recipe made with such care! Thank you, Chef!
Did the apron just talk?!
what happened to Francis?
THE ANIMATION ON THE APRON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
need to work fast to do this. very hot where I am.
わぁーフランシス動いてびっくり(＠_＠;)
ど根性ガエルみたいですね。

We love and miss you dearly Francis <3
❤️ ❤️
Which mochi brand do you use?
would it be possible to make them in advance and toss them in the freezer (or fridge for a day) to eat them later? if so, should i wait with applying the last coat of tea powder?
Oh my gosh 😭😭😭😭😭😭
awwwww! how I miss Francis

AH! Francis is talking to me! I've even taken my psychiatric medication today, so I know it's not my craziness making him talk. Well played, Chef and Ghost Of Francis.
Rest in peace Francis.
頑張ってください。 ^_^
おかえりなさい、シェフ！(^_^)
今日も素晴らしいレシピをありがとうございます！どうか身体に気をつけて、無理なさらない程度に動画のアップをお願いします。

RIP Francis - we all miss you!

Aww, animated Francis is so cute!  :D
I want a talking Francis apron too! 😭
AWW francis passed away T.T
やはり年齢的にフランシスの出演は完全に無理になったようですが、2代目を出す予定はないのでしょうか？
Wait, what? :C I started watching this show in a small local restaurant. I only saw the episodes with dog! I just looked this show up here and found out that something happened to Dog? :C Oh my poor heart... Right in the feels.... I'll keep watching all the episodes anyway, maybe start from the beginning at this point! <3
Francis ! I miss you.
Francis 😭
シェフさん👩‍🍳お元気でしょうか？久しぶりにお料理拝見できて嬉しいです！
this is so sad without Francis 😣😦😢
: ( animating the cartoon francis to talk kind of creeps me out....
I can't wait to make these!
I just realized how wired this show is
Omg did the dog DIE?! Wha- when? ;-; my sister and I loved him <3
Francis still rocking the kitchen even in the after life. :D
I love everything matcha. Matcha Kit-Kat, matcha ice cream... nom nommmatcha.
Verrrry nice I have never seen this type daifuku very nice
Beautiful and delicious.
シェフ、新しいビデオが出てうれしいです！ 私はいつもあなたのビデオを見て楽しんでいます！
I'm sorry, but when she turned to look at Francis at the end I teared up a bit. It's so wonderful to have you all back, and every episode carries on in the memory of Francis. You're all wonderful people.
God... that ending.... :'(
no Francis is dead!
Looks good i must see...
Animated Francis was a wonderful surprise!
I just understood that the dog is a fake 😅
I loved the animation on the apron! So happy to see you keep making videos chef. Will have to give this a try, probably without the red beans.
I subscribed to your last week and I had no idea that Francis is gone! T-T I keep reading about Francis's passing in the comments section. I'm sorry for your loss, Chef. He's in s bettrr place, now.
omg I didn't knew he die so sad he is in heaven with my dogs
im crying
I would love to try this !
wait  where is Francis?? did he die? is that why they put that picture?😐
Thank you for the video! Love Daifuku!

If I may ask - is there a trick to cleaning up mochi? It sticks to everything, and doing the dishes after is a nightmare!
Francis, we miss you. I still sad for you
#WeMissFrancis
生クリームやあんこを冷やすとは 初めてです  これからの季節にぴったりですね！フランシスも食べたそうですね！
When I discovered this cooking channel like today the first video was how to make gyudon with the dog at first it was weird  but it was  very cute and old. The chef and the dog was young but then when I saw this video I was surprised that the dog was now replaced with a picture frame I was sad and looked to the comments but then I just subscribed and happy because I got to discover this channel gonna miss Francis tho :(
what a sweet video!  and to see little francis talking...that was a surprise and i had to watch the video two times because the first time i was watching francis.  mmmm....looks yummy.
So lonely without Francis. Loved the animation on the apron though. 5:23 the smile she made after she talked to the phot was so adorable I can't even. 
has francis been taxidermied?
YAAAAAAAY new video! <3😄
do you have preferred matcha brands?
this looks so delicious

写真はキツいものがあるな…
so chefs apron became a medium of Francis spirit...   its like shaman king...?!?  O.O
Want to taste it so much...even once :/
Not a big fan of matcha, would kinako work just as well?
RIP Francis. You will be missed.
Where is he?
what kind of heartless bastard hit the dislike button
Hey Chef just wanted to tell you losing a pet or a family member in general is never easy. I had a dog  (he was basically my first pet) I wanted to take him to prom and take senior pictures with him 😂 he was my buddy and unfortunately dogs weren't allowed at prom so I went with my human friends lol but he passed away almost 3 years ago (november) and it never gets easy for me. I know he was sick and the best thing to do so he didn't suffer was put him to sleep. 

it was a rough week of crying and a month of still thinking I would see him when I went outside, it was tough for me even after a year but time passes and life goes on. I know there will never be another dog like him because hey no one can replace your first pet. 

I'm sorry for the loss of Francis, I have to say it was pretty unique to see a dog as a chef! haha he was super cute! I hope you are doing well and wish you all the best!
Que le paso al perrito?

nice video, it looks yummy 😊
How to save it for the next day? Will the refrigerator ruin it?
РОССИЯ...☺👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌👌👌СПАСИБО....
I hope they move francis to sitting in the bed (but not really) like an opening that ends with him jumping out of the apron and then sparkles and bam! francis the animated dog sitting in his bed just like it is a blue clues tv show XDDD
The best thing to do after a dog dies is to find a replacement. It's not good to dwell in sorrow.
They look like cute little berries, I wish they really were so you could plant a tree and just pick them off and eat ^_^
what happened to Francis??
Get a puppy, this is depressing
What accent is this?
what happened to the dog????
I'm gonna try to make this next weekend!

dog died?!???
chef, can I use corn starch instead?
I miss you guys so much!!!! Francis still lives on with us, really heartwarming. I'm going to try this recipe for dessert tomorrow! 
Why the dislikes?
Where is the dog
whats the use of plastic wrap when heating the food in the microwave?
what happened to the real dog?
Felt quite a tinge of sadness when Chef talked to the picture of Francis D:
my dog pass away last month
did the dog die >
What happaned to the dog? have not watch this show for some time...
Is there any way to do this without a microwave?
wait what happened to the doggo
is dog died?
Can I use melted kiritanpo mochi instead? The block mochi ones?
Could this recipe be frozen after being prepared?
WAIT THE PUPPY IS GONE??? .-.
Kinda creepy having a picture of a dead dog there
OYYY, WHEN DID FRANCIS DIE? That sucks so bad. :C
Please get a new dog!
Yiiiick! 餡子は大嫌いよ！嫌なだ！
the accent bugs me
please get a new puppy...Francis 2...
Please get a new dog... the picture of Francis is too sad to look at! :'(
Why don't you adopt another dog?
This is getting creepy...  Let's face it.  The show is never the same once Francis is dead.  :（
This is so sad. Please get another dog. You need help to process this an a new dog might just do that. It won't replace Francis but it would be much healthier. The picture is not Francis.
stop milking francis
I am so relieved to  see chef smile again.
Seeing the picture of Francis still breaks my heart. 😢 But I am happy to see more videos, he would be happy to see them. Thanks for your strength. '^^
My heart stopped for a sec for I saw Francis in the intro...
Hi Chef! Please keep publishing videos, we love your channel!
Seeing the picture of Francis almost made me cry. Francis would be so proud of you all. Thank you for sharing this recipe and many more with the world!
This is really hard to watch. Sitting over here crying over a scramble video. This sweet, strong woman; if my dog passed away I'd just crawl in a hole and die. On a slightly more relevant note, this looks delicious.
i have never been so early before and this looks delicious! wait... sees Francis' picture
gross sobbing
Thanks for coming back. We miss you.

Another delicious recipe from Chef.  Many of us Fans will always miss Francis, but we are glad to see Chef on video again.   Thank you!
When I saw this in my youtube I was like, Francis? Francis is still here? Or is it Francis' child?

Thank you for another great video and recipe. We will never forget the dog.

I love this show and I miss Francis. Thank you for continuing the series even if it makes us all ugly cry.
Keeping a picture of Francis nearby seems like a great tribute. I think you dealt with the passing of Francis in a great way.
Thank you chef for carrying on making these wonderful videos. Francis is in our hearts too, next to you.
This looks awesome! I'm totally going to make this!
You are the best, chef! Thank you so much for your recipes :) I'm sending you a lot of love from Fukuoka <3
Qué feliz estoy porque chef volvió a subir recetas!💐 
Pero siempre echaré de menos a Francis😢.
 Saludos desde Bélgica!
It's so wonderful to see you once again, Chef! Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!
We all love and miss you Francis !
Chef-sensei, domo arigato gozaimasu!!
Chef should get a loud ass parrot to juxtapose Francis. Also no risk of her outliving it.

Alternatively, a tortise.
Francis, rest in peace forever in doggy heaven. We miss you!! Sending lots of love to his sweet family. <3
Francis will always live on in our hearts. The viewers who don't even cook but watch these videos anyway because they always bring us such joy.
Perfect Dofu! Francis would be very proud....Mapo Doufu is my personal favorite but the chicken isnt bad either.
OH HOW I'VE MISSED YOU <3 Much love from Los Angeles, CA!
Welcome back! I love your recipes so much and I look forward for more upcoming videos.
Now I am sad, bacause Ididn´t know, that Francis died T_T
I so shocked in the intro. I just like Francis is back !?!?
But he's rested in peace and paradise with new owner and happiness. We miss you !!
#WeMissFrancis
I like seeing chef smile :) R.I.P.  Francis
Seeing the picture of Francis while Chef was cooking reminds me of my Grandma. Her husband loved her cooking and he passed away when she was only 45. So she keeps a portrait of him next to her stove as a reminder to keep doing what she loves to do. Francis is probably so happy that you keep making such wonderful food chef :)
For a second I thought it Francis. My heart is breaking. Thank you Chef for continuing! We all miss him as well.
Thank you for continuing to cook chef, we love you. <3
I'm so happy you're continuing!! Love your recipe choices :)
Thank you for continuing posting videos, your channel always gives a smile in my heart. Francis will always continue to watch over your family.
Missed the delicious food videos, hope Chef is okay! =)

I'm sorry, but having that picture next to chef made me sad. ;-; Glad to see another video from this channel again though.
The dish looks so yummy! I'm definitely gonna try out this recipe♡
Gracias por la traducción al español, siempre veo sus videos pero no entendía mucho, ahora si 😊
OMGoodness.  I just saw the picture of Francis :(  aww I'm so sorry for your loss.     Excuse me while I cry.  I know he was a delight to you.
Delicioso!
Muchas gracias!
saludos
I have never been this early to a cooking with dog video. Great video as always?
Thank you for continuing to post videos! This looks delicious!
many thanks and blessings for the cooking with dog cast. I hope Francis is doing well in a new place. tons of love.
I am glad to see chef laugh and smile. Thank you very much for these videos.
I'm Very happy to see you again chef!Keep up the great Chanel, you make the world a happier place.
My heart hurts every time I see Francis' framed picture.
I never put my re-hydrated shiitake mushrooms in the fridge overnight before, I didn't know! I will try this. And I'm so happy to have our hosts do a new video. <3
Omg, thick strips!! Love you all who work on this channel.
i love this cooking channel because i can follow the recipes and how to cook it easily thank you.
gosh this woman is am absolutely amazing chef!!!
Cooking without dog

I'm going to hell I'm so sorry I thought of that and chuckled
we miss you francis, you will always be in our hearts. (∩_∩) stay fluffy in heaven fellow poodle♥
hello chef! thank  you for carrying on!
I am new to the channel...I was watching video back in 2014 when I saw this video....
I LOVE YOU FRANCIS!!!
Chef - my wife is allergic to mushrooms.  Is there something I can substitute them with to get the same effect?
"Hi, I'm Francis, the gHost of the show Cooking with Dog." <3 >w<
anyone else rewind the video to see Francis again? got that lump in my throat and cried but it makes me happy to see him. love your videos Chef! thank you for continuing to share with us.
guys I have an idea on how we can have our own Francis......shiny hunt for a Furfruw (hope I got the name right) and name it Francis
Que genial después de tiempo que hacen un video 😊😊😊😊
We miss you so much chef! Please keep filming your delicious recipes ❤️
for a sec I thought you bought another dog....
I'm sincerely sorry for the loss of Francis , I miss him and I feel warm in my heart keep hearing his given voice, and seeing his photographs in his little bed and plushee... makes me cry with joy as Francis is still with us... while Chef keeps cooking and sharing her recipes... you are great humans I want to be like you. Thank you for making this channel!
Love that you are making videos again. :)
Maybe you should use a Francis plush instead if the picture. The picture is kind of sad.
I'm really curious but does anyone know substitutes for tofu?
This looks absolutely delicious!
Since Francis passed on I just feel like crying every time I watch this show :(
we love you chef! keep making vidoes
OMG I DIDNT KNOW FRANCIS DIED! I am so sad right now!!!!!
Chef, I'm happy to see you continue doing what you love for us. I miss Francis but I love to watch you cook. It always looks so delicious! One day I would love to see some videos you might have of Francis outside of the kitchen. I think it would be a great honor to him. Welcome back Chef! ❤
this is a nice comment section :), love your food, wish i could taste it but i can't afford the ingredients to make it myself.
thanks for your videos and your dog is really cute. miss em.
i love this channel so much! you bring so much joy to my kitchen :)
plzzz 4 god sake get a new dog...... T.T puppy shiba inu will be nice >.O
Chef, you're smiling again! :3 <3
Still the best cooking channel on YouTube. :)

Great to see new videos. I've learned so much from Chef and Francis over the years, and I've yet to see a single dish presented that I didn't want to eat right then and there!

As I suspect with most people, Francis brought me to this channel, but the wonderful recipes, easy to follow directions and Chef's skill kept me subscribed and enjoying it. Of course, adorable Francis helped it stand out though!

I hope this channel continues to thrive, as a tribute to Francis and what he helped create here, but also because it really is IMO one of the best cooking shows around (YouTube or otherwise).

But even if it becomes too much to keep updating, we understand too... and so long as the previous videos are online, Francis will never be forgotten, nor all the hearts he touched.
I'm so happy you're back, Chef! I love your videos and I'm glad Francis is still with us in some way :.)
I'm literally going to cry omg
Gonna miss that doggo. Take care of yourself, Chef. It's tough, but we're all rooting for you!
i dont think i can go through the episode without crying thats okay though its still a good episode thank you chef! thank you Francis!
Sounds amazing got to try it. Have to do a new 1800 calorie diet tofu should be able to reduce a lot of it.
I'm going to lose it when chef passes. I will cry forever.
we love you Chef!
Francis is so proud of you chef from over the rainbow bridge! he must be cooking up a storm up there!
its 3 in the morning and I'm crying for a dog that I don't even know.
Thank you for coming back. Thank you, really.
This is sad. Can't watch this. Maybe they should have gotten a new dog. Having the pic of Frances is heartbreaking for me 😞😞
if only my super market around the corner had firm tofu...
Man, Chef never ceases to put a smile on my face every time a new video pops up.
You are such an inspiration chef and other crew members of this channel! Your videos bring my family so many smiles and we love trying out your recipes! They are easy to follow but still teaches us new skills and tricks! We miss Francis and our prayers and hearts are with you always! Thank you for all that you do!
still makes me sad that francis passed away
Oh man that next one looks so good! I can't wait for next week!
rest in peace fransis...you'll be miss
I can't watch this now without crying now that Frances is gone.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Chef looks much happier in this video!
I miss Francis, but I still love your videos!
Welcome back Chef! 

Rip Francis. <3
miss u so much. hope you could keep updating. Your food are amazing.
What's happen to your hands, chef? May I ask, please?
คิดถึงฟรานซิสมาก
My sweet Francis I didnt knew my sweetest dog passed away. 😭
OMG! Francis already passed away :((((((
Before I love to watch the videos on this channel so much , but I started to watch other videos and never came back to watch videos on this channel nearly 1 year and now I'm so sad :((((
Chef!! I'm so happy you're back!! シェフ！あなたが戻ってきてとても嬉しいです！
I am torturing myself by watching this
Oh, it looks very comforting. It will taste great with some rice, although I'll add some bell peppers as well for extra flavor (and extra veggies). Thanks!
This looks so good and simple I love it!
Thank you for coming back, chef! We miss you. Deepest condolences on the passing of Francis. I love your cooking videos. Please continue and share with us. Big hugs!
I miss Francis, but i miss chef and these videos even more..
This looks so delicious!  I can't wait to try making it!  I love tofu.  I eat it every day.  I am so happy to have a new recipe to try.  Thank you so much, Chef.  I look forward to the next video.  The mochi looks delicious, too.  Please take care of yourself, and be well!  :-)
Frances will always be in our hearts.
I've been looking for more tofu recipes! I hope you are well. We all love you so much.
Good to see you Chef.
Thank you for the recipe!!❤️
It looked delicious. I'd missed your cooking videos.
This looks so delicious, thanks for sharing!
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one for Teishoku pleeeease...I'm a long time subscriber of your channel. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲
I'm so proud of this comment section. Best wishes, chef <3
Dear Chef and Cooking with Dog team,

Thank you for cooking on.
Thank you for your consideration.
Thank you for your kindness.
Thank you for not replacing Francis with a gimmick.
Thank you for teaching us so many things.

Thank you.
omg I am so sorry, I love this show and he was awesome
It looks so good. :< I wish it wasn't 3AM and I'm not drooling at something I can't even attempt to make for a good 10 hours.
I miss Frances
本日の炒り豆腐が本当に美味しそうです。
Love it that you still make videos! Francis will live on as long as he is remembered :) Nice to see you smiling Chef!
So good to see that you're still producing videos.
FRANCIS ❤
Heartbroken. The cute dog has passed away.
I made this recipe last night.... delicious! My husband and daughter were very happy :)

Francis is forever with us.
Thank you for sharing this recipe ^_^
おいしそうですね。
ワンちゃんは元気にしてますか。

ありがとうチェッフ！
Welcome back chef!!!
<3 <3 yuummy
I miss Francis. So hard to watch with his photo just sitting there.
やっぱりフランシスいないとなんか物足りなく感じますね😢
シェフさん、旦那さん、お久しぶりです。
フランシスちゃんがいなくなられた時からしばらくチャンネルを見ないでお気の毒ですが、今見ると感激すぎて泣きました。

シェフさんのご努力を見ると嬉しくも感じます。
これからも応援してあげます。
I am still getting used to watch Cooking with Dog videos through this shroud of tears.
フランシス(；ω；)
Oishi! <3 Thanks for a new Recipe chef! :)
I miss Francis.  He was a cute and well behaved dog.  But I wish in the near future you guys will get another dog :)
お疲れ様です！＾＾
Welcome back Chef! :)
Welcome back chef!
Thank you, Chef ❤️ Arigato forever
I haven't watch this show in about a year. I'm kinda emotional. I love the pic of Frances in the bed.
I'M CRYING
シリーズを続いていただいて本当にありがとうございます！
I am happy to see you making new videos!!
Nice to see you return. We will always remember you Francis.
Hi chef! Is it possible to replace the shiitake liquid with something else? Not a big fan of shiitake mushrooms, but everything else looks delicious! :)
Missing Francis a lot. I hope you'll recover and decide to adopt a new friend, take care chef.
I clicked on the video because cooking with a dog sounds spectacular, but then I read the comments and now I'm depressed. I just now discovered this channel and I'm on the brink of tears. :'(
we miss you!!!
シェフさん！ずっと観てます！動画上げ続けてくださってありがとうございます。
オススメのフライパンとかいつも使っているキッチン用品を教えて欲しいです！
Have a great day Chef!!!!! 💛💛💛
明日の晩御飯はこれにしよう！フランシスくんの写真すごいかわいい＼(^o^)／
Hello, chef. I am new to the channel & had the unfortunate timing of never getting to really know about Francis & yourself till now. Luckily I have the massive archive of videos to remember Francis by. I hope one day, once you've healed from the loss of a true companion, you can also reminisce by watching the videos you guys made together :-) Whether you continue this channel or not, thank you for sharing Francis & yourself to us.
The mochi in the coming soon section looks so good ✨✨ 期待しています \(^o^)/
I love chef. She is so sweet. She prepares everything in a very organised and systematic manner, which makes it  very easy to follow. 
どうもありがとうございました
Oh no, I wasn't aware that Francis passed away. So sorry for your loss ; (
すごい　美味し
Looks so delicious, thank you for sharing!
美味しそう～(´ω｀*)
具沢山で食べごたえもありそうですね！
我が家のはねぎと木耳しか入ってなかったですｗ
Welcome back chef
I love this recipe!
so glad your back
ご飯にのせて丼にしても美味しそうですね！椎茸の戻し汁が深みを出してくれそうです(^ω^)作ってみます♫
Thank you for the recipe Chef.
good job,I liked your work
so cute seeing chef laughing at the end of the video. 💜
Stay strong, Chef! We love you!
I just keep looking at Francis' picture. Love shiitake mushrooms! 👍😊👨‍🍳
I'm usually not the biggest tofu fan but this dish looks delicious. I especially love the idea of using the broth from the shiitake mushrooms--will definitely try it, thanks chef!
I love Francis and you Chef-san your recipes are the Best, still made woderful and delicious Récipes with us! :) I love see the photo of Francis because he still in the show in our hearts #LoveChef-san we support you  #WillalwaysloveyouFrancis #CookingWithDog
FRANCIS!!!!!!!
<3
My husband is extremely allergic to mushrooms, so I can't use the shiitake mushrooms. What would you recommend as a replacement for the shiitake broth?
love this show
chef you have taught me so many things!
❤🐩💔
Can one skip the chicken if they vegan? just asking cause I want to share this with my aunt.
Man.... why do I cry so much more when a dog passes away rather than a human?! Francis and Gabe will be missed immensely 😞
So happy to see you here with another video!  Thanks!
新たなメニューをアップしていただいて、本当にうれしく思っています。
さまざまに察し申し上げるばかりですが、どうかお元気で。そしてシェフが料理を楽しまれ、その美味しさが伝わるビデオをこれからもゆったりとしたペースでアップして下さいね。楽しみにしております☆
Awwwh I saw the picture in the frame.... I miss Francis!!!
Thank you so much chef!

Francis, the heavenly host. <3

i really love this recipe, altho we dont use snow peas because it's quite expensive here

so tofu, egg, mushroom, and carrot then for the meat we use any leftover we had like chicken or pork or even some fish and we put chili slices because we love spicy food
Omg I miss Francis ; - ;
Oh god. I didn't know... ;~:

かなりおいしい、あなたのレシピのおかげで
やっぱりちょっと寂しいですね。cooking with photo に今後なるんですね。
This makes me so nostalgic and sad seeing the portrait of Francis. I started watching back in high school so I can't believe how long its been.
体に気をつけて頑張ってください！！🌟
rip the dog
may be you should take another puppy Francis? do you think about it?
Miss you Francis!
:'( sniff sniff
RIP Francis!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
its too sad to watch
yummy!
Hiii
Rest easy Francis
👍
I will just pour it over my hot steamed rice and NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM!
That actually looks pretty good, I might try to make that.
I honestly don't know how to get about this with a new dog. Part of me just doesn't feel right about it, but I'm also happy to have the show back.
I thought it was a puppy lol I didn't realize it was a picture
So wonderful to see a new video from this channel!
Chef looks much happier!
snow peas and tofu!! yay!
We love you Chef!
Hopefully this channel will go on while Francis is in heaven..
great to see you back xx
I miss Francis
This looks so good!  My husband can't eat shiitake mushrooms.  Is there something I could substitute for the shiitake mushrooms and liquid?
Oh Francis... you'll be missed so much.
Awesome to see you keep posting videos :)
ughhhhh, this has become too hard to watch chef cook by herself. someone get francis back for her!
I'm so going to make this but I am skipping the chicken.
Happy to see Chef again
I love your channel so, so much!
Chef, I am so happy to see you again.Your videos always make me happy. 頑張ってください
I'm so happy to see you smile chef!
Francis will be missed
:)
Mama's dish  ><
miss you
I miss you Francis
Good to see the chef again :)
I started to cry i saw francis
Awe they put a portrait ;-;
Come on, get a new dog. There is nothing wrong about it i think. All dogs are very cute and cool! ^_^
Delicious :) Nice to see you Chef!
ํYummy. Thank you for sharing.
I have a request - can you teach us how to make those yummy Japanese pickle?  I went to the Nishiki Market, and i loved all the pickles. I can't even name the taste.... The cucumber one was my favorite, i also like the purple one :)
💔
Hi i have a new cooking channel and wanted to know if you would like to collaborate on a video?
love love love 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
What happened to Francis? Is he dead?
おいしそうっす
big hugs chef
Buy new dog
that's pretty good
Chef has lost some weight and the twinkle in her eyes is gone. Probably, because she misses Francis.
😨
ワンちゃんに何かあったの？
Looks delicious.
Can i avoid adding chicken 🐓, i m vegetarian
this looks easy and cheap to make! I will try it some time _
面白い動画を作って頂いて、誠に有難うございます。頑張って下さい。
im confused...
where your dog
I miss francis T-T
I love how Francis says pieces
I know how to transfer a dog's consciousness to a new body if that helps.
i have so much respect for the chef for not just replacing francis or trying to move on with out him.
THE WORLD CAN BE SO CRUEL
I thought they were going to stop publishing?
My mom makes us eat the mushroom stems
こんにちは！今日のランチはこれでした！減塩醤油大さじ1と砂糖小さじ2で作ると、とてもおいしかったです～ 
ありがとうございます！ヾ(´∇｀)ノﾞ
私はあなたを欠場、フランシス
I am very happy you guys are still making videos but it is also very sad to not have Francis.
I'm so, so sad Francis has passed. Yet somehow the voice over is strangely comforting because we've always associated that as being his "voice" if he COULD talk, I guess? So in a way it's like he's still there with chef, haha. RIP, Francis. 😔
Chef 頑張ってください！Chef の髪は美しいです！
母親が自分の子供たちを教えると同じように私たちを教えていただきありがとうございます。
私はブラジル、日経サンセイですが、現在オランダに住んでいます。
いろいろな料理を教えて、非常に感謝しています。
（しつれいな日本語で申し訳ありません）
フランスでドライ椎茸がしか見つけない。
もしかしたら、結局チャネル閉めないの？
その場合はうれしいですね。
フランシスくんは確かに見てるわん。
What?? What happened to Francis?
Delicious!
So sad :(
We love you, Chef. 💜💜💜💜
It looks delicious!  I want to make it
Dear chef, as a dog owner, I ask you please get a puppy to continue your happiness <3 little frances will always be with us but I am pretty sure he will like you have a new companion
who is fransic?
Here is an idea, how about getting a rescue dog to continue the show to also let people know to spay/neuter their pets as well as the overpopulation of pets on the plant. That would very much be remembering Francis and not replacing him.
good to see you, chef :)
I will always be this channel's fan!
what is the brand of the wok? Really wanna know! Thank you
我识睇简体字
what is dufo?
it's just not the same 😢😭😭😭😭
Omfg i thought that francis was a taxidermy for a sec.. rip francis :(
wtf what happened to the dog
Is this ok for bento?
my lovely chef , take care ...love you always ...
Do you sell the Francis plush toys?
It's look taste!!!wanna try this one!!
is that new baby francis?
犬しんだの？
is it just me, who saw chef's face is sad? like she can't stand to this anymore. if that so, i totally can understand about that. I'm sad too about Francis and i miss him so much :')
Hi, where is Francis ?? Is he alright ??
What happen for the dog?
Good too see your still making videos
Just cooked it :) Very delicious!
ありがとうございます
Today I miss you'r channel and search for it, now Im on full on tears juts wanting more. Chef, you are the reason I eat vegetables.
A very healthy dish
chef, please make Abura Soba recipe, i really like it but don't know how to make it. I search all the recipe in youtube and they're always turn too brown. I ate the best Abura Soba in Indonesia and it's so delish (you can google it Abura Soba in Grand Indonesia, Jakarta). I don't know that's the authentic one like in Japan or not, but in here before we eat it, we must pour the vinegar and chili oil. It's quit expensive if i eat it for everyday =((
I have a hard time seeing minor details, so when I saw the dog in the dog bed I thought "omg that's a really realistic toy dog.." and then while reading the comments it hit me. It was a picture.
will there be a francis 2.0? I know Francis cannot be replaced, but perhaps another animal would be awesome too
Do you cook the dog?
👍🇸🇬
I gotta say, I am so very glad to see this channel going. It made me interested in cooking and actually - taught me to watch my diet more. First thing I made, that I could call a dish were stuffed peppers from past video. Now I changed from sandwich-and-canned soup eating teenager into healthy eating adult. Thanks, chef! I really appreciate all the effort you put in the videos!
🐶

クッキング本を作ってください。是非買いたいですね。
She looks happy :)
Is this a new little poodle baby? How old is he/she?
I just learned about Francis!  I am so sorry. I know how you feel. we lost our pet due to cancer. Still watch your episodes. Any news on a new Francis?
Is the chef going to adopt another poodle anytime? It's just not the same without a little Francis:(
PLESEA READ TIS PLS PLS.whats this  japanese food called its a fish fried with scrambled eggs and served on noodles? also cold green tea.pls whats this and if you know whats his can you make a video about it?
I hate grow up, I hate when people and pet around me pass away, I hate this life :(
Wait when did Francis die?!
Franciss me and my mom misses u 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐩🐩🐩🐩🤧😭😭😭😭
犬はどこ?
its nice to see shes doing well
Chef i see your smile and isn´t the same than before. You look tired and sad. Please take away this photography. Hurts a lot. Hugs from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Why did they add the carat after the onion if the carat will take longer to cook?
Can i ask you a quest? Where's Francis......
If i were you, i'd drop the dog thing, is a little creepy. 
Let's keep him a fond memory.
Cooking with a dead dog.
Life has to go on.  Get another dog...
Oh Chef, It's so good to see you. 💕 And Francis, we miss you, but it's just wonderful to hear your voice. 💕
Does anyone have a feeling that chef's still very sad? She smile, but sad.
We know it's hard for you chef, but we want you to know that we appreciate you making new videos. Thank you for keeping it up
it took me 16 seconds to start crying
please take care of yourself chef! if it's still too much to handle making these videos all your fans will understand if you still need time.  my yorkie died over 2 years ago and I'm still not over it and I miss him dearly. I wish you well. good luck in the kitchen
I cried the day that he died I learned how to cook off this chanel when I was twelve and I was twelve 7 years ago the Web series gave me inspiration to become a chef I am currently in College to become a professional chef. Thank you Chef and Francis you have completely changed my life. 🐩🍙🍚🍜🍛🍡🍤🍥🍣🍱🎂🍫🍰
Thank you Chef for this video.  I believe I speak for lots in that we miss you and Francis is missed.  Please take care of yourself too!
Thank you, Chef for making this video. We all loved Francis and miss him. Thank you for honouring his life with photos, his mini likeness and his apron. Sending you much love and healing. I too cried and made sure my fur babies get extra cuddles all the time.
Thank your for another dericious video! Please don't let the channel be a burden, and I hope keeping Francis memory makes the days lighter and happier! Love from Brazil!
I am glad that you are back on the show. Francis will be greatly missed but it is good to see you are doing well.
なんだかフランシスがいつものようにそこに居て、鼻をクンクンさせてるような気がしました。シェフさん、お辛いでしょうけど、あまり気を落とさずに...フランシスは私達の心の中にずっと居ます😌
Thank you for making more videos. Even though Francis was not there  phisically Chef an awesome  job, as always. I'm sure Francis is proud.
Thank you for continuing to make these videos, chef! I'm sure Francis is happy watching this on the other side! Keep up the awesome work! Greetings from Brazil!
My condolences to you. And thank you for your strength and for teaching us so much!!!

I really care about you and Francis! 

I started cooking because of your channel and now I follow that path as a career. 

You inspire me so much!
Welcome back, Chef!!! Thank you so much for not leaving YouTube! We all love you! Take care! <3
brb crying into a pillow because Chef and Francis first inspired my love for cooking and I'm both grateful and sad
視聴者さんのコメントが皆温かく、改めてシェフとフランシスとプロデューサーさんの魅力を感じました。
寂しい気持ちもありますが、笑顔でまた動画を上げてくださって感謝の気持ちでいっぱいです！
これからも世界中の皆様から愛される料理をお届けしていってくださいね！
Hi Chef!  mahalo for doing what you do. I believe you are keeping his wonderful memory alive by creating dishes.  Love from Hawaii.
Great video!
You can also substitute salt with your tears.
Hi chef. It's so good to see you again!!!! これからも頑張ってください。^_^
not gonna lie, I cried so hard in the beginning. WE LOVE YOU CHEF!!!
Francis might not be sitting in the kitchen now, but he's sitting in our hearts.
This is the best morning present I ever received-- a new video from Chef after Francis' passing. Thank you for keeping on and being so cheerful even though Francis has gone on to be a dog angel. 

Now you've made me go and crave for fried rice. 😅
I never really expected them to make new videos. I stayed subscribed because I have been a follower for years and also I enjoy making the recipes... but this made me tear up. Stay strong, Chef. 💕
Thank you so much for continuing. Francis' looks so precious in this picture. I will definitely try this recipe!
I think I speak for everyone when I say this. We love and support you chef , I send good vibes your way. <3
A new video! My heart is so happy! Thank you, Chef, we know it is difficult without your beloved Francis, but we are all so happy you will continue to make videos! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I will miss Francis, but it is nice to see Chef again, and to hear the voice of Francis. All of the love to everyone behind this channel.
i miss Francis, but i am glad you are still making videos!
I'm not cutting onions...Y-YOU'RE CUTTING ONIONS! THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS! Begins sobbing 

Thank you for still cooking for us, Chef! I'm sure Francis is happily watching you, still wanting any scraps you can give him!
I'm glad you all are still making videos! I really like seeing these Japanese/Asian recipes since I don't get to see them much. I hope Francis is still enjoying watching you cook from doggy heaven❤️

Warmest greetings from the Netherlands
We love you chef. And we understand that you're still grieving. Francis is watching you from heaven, and he's be very happy to know that you've continued to pursue your love of cooking :)
I'm so sorry to hear about that. Thanks you guys still keep making videos🙏 we say everything has a new life circle, maybe Francis become a chef ! We he knew how to cook taste food already! God bless you guys!
２０１１年ごろから観てたクッキングウィスドッグ僕はフランシスがこの世を去ったと言うことが非常に悲しく思います。和食の作り方がわからない僕にはとてもためになったチャンネルでございます。仕事のため、母国から離れて母の手料理もいただくことができず、なにより家庭料理がとても恋しく思いながら丁寧に教えていただいておかげさまでなんとか美味しくできあがりました。チェッフこれからも美味しい和食を作ってね。応援しております。フランシスありがとうございました！
Looks delicious as always ❤
I'm so happy you are still making new recipe videos! I missed this channel so much!
It's so wonderful to see our lovely Chef again. We will always miss Francis, and we very much missed you as well, Chef. <3
Thank you for making new videos. I really appreciate it.
OMG... Thought I wouldn't see a new video after almost 2 months :(
It makes me sad that Chef is sad, but she has great strength to keep going even without Francis. I wish Chef only health and happiness!
Awww... great recipe! Rest In Paradise, Francis <3
I understand the pain of loosing a beloved pet. And both Francis and Chef have become apart of our families. It is good to have you back in our lives Chef. We have missed you so very much.
Stay strong chef, we appreciate your diligence! Arigatougozaimasu. So happy to see you again ^-^
Thank you for come back. We love your recipes 💕
I hope to see the series continue with a Francis Plushy.
Chef, I think of you often and I'm so glad to see your face. Watching your channel is an inspiration and it's my happy place. Thank you~ I know Francis is proud of you. <3
Thank you for continuing on without Francis, Chef! We all miss him dearly.
Thank You for coming Back💖 this made my day!💖😘😁
I noticed people are sad. I'm honestly happy to see a new video. this means the chef is getting better and leaving the mourning period. sure, losing Francis is a tough hit, but as humans we adapt and move on. seeing her cook again and smile is absolutely great.
can't help with the tears when i saw Francis' photo on his usual spot. 😢😢
I almost cried when chef gave her introduction. Thank you for being strong!!
i kinda lost it when i saw francis' framed photo perched on his stool... Q_Q
Thank you for deciding to continue making the videos! I really love this channel and the recipes are always so wonderfully broken down for viewers and at the same time serve as a connection to the Japanese culture and cusine. 🌸 本当によっかたです！シェフのレシピをいつも楽しんで、期待しています😀フランシスもきっと天国で見ています。
Thank you Chef for continuing to make these videos. I know it must be difficult. Sending much love to you! <3
Thank you for continuing the cooking show, Chef. When I saw his picture in Francis' usual spot, I burst into tears. We love you and Francis!
Thank you for making more videos, Chef. I am crying happy tears ("A tear for every happy thought").
Thank you for continuing to share your recipe, we miss you Francis! He will continue to watch over chef from heaven!
I am happy to see that you are going to continue making videos :D
Stay strong chef! Sending love and prayers! thank you for posting!
It makes my heart so glad to see you with a new video, Chef. Chuka Okowa looks delicious! It's good to see you are up to making new videos for the channel again, I've always looked forward to them. You are strong to keep going after such sad times. <3

Chef, thank you so much for presenting us with such culinary beauty. If it any point you feel that it's too much to continue, I and many others will understand. Francis wasn't just a pet, but a part of your family. I hope you're doing well, Chef.

Thank you for making another video!  We loved Francis, but we live Chef too.  We are so happy to see you make videos still.
I am so happy to see you all back.  I, like many viewers, took Francis' passing pretty hard.  I'm glad that you all took the break that you needed before returning.  

I have been following this channel for quite some time and have weathered the ups and downs with you.

Bless you for continuing to work and make videos after Francis's passing 😭❤ he would be so proud and happy that Chef is being so strong
I was teary eyed all through this video. I'm so glad this channel will continue even without Francis physically there. He is definitely watching over you, Chef.
Thank you for continuing with the videos, Chef! I really hope you're doing well and I'm sure Francis would be happy to see you keeping the series going. I have tons of respect for you, and I wish you the best.

Thank you, chef, for continuing on. Francis, I am sure, is very proud.
I honestly love watching because of Chef! Shes my favorite ♡ I am so happy to see her back and hope she cheers up soon.
i laughed and cried at the same time when I saw that they used a picture of Francis. It's both funny and extremely sad.
Looks tasty chef! Thank you for continuing to share your knowledge and recipes with us. :-)
I'm glad that you have continued to share recipes and videos for us, chef! Francis is in a good place now and will be greatly missed. Please take care! :)
Seeing Francis picture on the screen instead of him in real life made me cry 😢 rip little prince I miss you so much.
I am glad you are back :)
Hope to see more of you!!!
I still remember the time years ago when I first saw the name of this channel and thought something else...Thankyou chef!
It's so good to see another video from you. I miss Francis, but Chef always does a great job. Thank you for sharing with us, as always!
I'm sorry for your loss, Chef. That is a hard thing to go through, my heart goes out to you.Francis will be greatly missed, but I hope to keep supporting your channel as much as I can.
Every upload the crew makes - though rare - is a real treat to have. Thank you for this! I think Francis's picture and the apron is very sweet.
Thank you so much for this vid. Hope you are doing well.
Thank you Chef for continuing the cooking show!
We missed you Chef. ❤ I'm so sorry for your loss of your sweet friend. Thank you for making a new video. Francis is proud of you, I know it!

Chef, it was very brave of you to make this video. Thank you for your effort, Francis would be very proud for sure, he is definitely smiling.
This...this ruined my day. I haven't seen a video in a long time as I have been busy. I knew Francis was getting old so out of panic I clicked this video. As soon as I saw the picture I lost it. Chef I love you, please stay strong. Francis is enjoying great meals in heaven.😢😔❤❤
Ah I missed you guys. i hope Chef will recover from the loss soon. We all miss Francis! love from Austria
ps: looks delicious!
My toy poodle passed away, suddenly, around the same time as Francis. I know how heartbreaking it is. I appreciate everything that you do, Chef! 💕
I didn't know about Francis, that makes me so sad :( rip <3 and be strong, chef!
chef we love you! thank you for everything, we will support you all the way. even if francis isn't here, we still love him and he'll always be a part of the community
This is finally happening!! Keep going chef I love your vids!!
"Hi, I'm Francis, the gHost of this show—Cooking with Dog." You are missed, pooch. <3
Chef, thank you for being so hard-working for both Francis and your viewers. The beginning of the video made me cry hearing and seeing Francis and because I can see how much you miss him, and my heart truly aches for you. Please don't overwork yourself!
Thank you for working hard to make these videos even in mourning. We are missing Francis with you.
Chef is just one of the best souls on Earth why did she have to lose Francis
I'm so glad you came back! I love your videos!  <3
Thank you chef for coming back, we hope too see more of you in time to come. We will miss our little chef, but nice to see you whenever you can. Sending big hugs 🤗 to you 👩‍🍳 from San Diego California
I'm glad you made a new video for us to enjoy. I hope you're doing well, Chef. Thank you.
Oh my God,  rest in peace dear doggy!  😇 You will be missed 💗
最近 動画がなかったので心配しておりました
フランシスさんが写真で登場されたのでビックリしました
いつもお料理をおとなしくみている姿が忘れられません
説明する声は、ほんとうにフランシスさんの声だと思ってしまってました    家族がなくなるのは悲しいですが 少しづつ時が 優しく包んでくれると思います     これからも 美味しいお料理楽しみにしています
 フランシスさんのご冥福心より申し上げます
I can't wait to make this recipe! It looks delicious. I might use crawfish instead of shrimp since I have some on hand. I'm so happy to see Chef back in the kitchen
Thank you, chef, for keeping a smile on your face and your chin up! We all appreciate what you do and I send many hugs your way
It's hard chef, we all miss Francis. Thank you for doing these videos, I have missed them very much.
i've seen your videos for a while now, yet this is the first time i leave   a comment. Just had to let you know how much i appreciate to see you are still making new videos for us. Thank you!!!
So happy you posted. Seeing Francis's picture there made me start balling instantly. He's watching down from puppy heaven. Love you guys.
chef, I understand that it must be extremely hard to lose Francis but I'm really happy to see you back making delicious recipes. Francis would have loved to sit next to you and continue to watch you cook
I am so sory to hear about Francis passing. Please accept my sincere condolences for your loss. Thank you for your continued efforts in sharing your recipes with us.
Wonderful to see you again, Chef, we miss you Francis, you remind me so much of my poodle, DuPont.  Great to hear your voice, and you live forever in our hearts, Francis.
We love you, chef! My family lost our dog of 14 years this past June and it was absolutely heartbreaking. We understand if you ever want to take a break! Your videos are amazing as always!
Francis is forever with us, our perfect little chef
This is such a sweet way to remember Francis. I'll miss him napping or sniffing the ingredients tho. Thank you for staying with us, Chef!
Francis would be very happy and proud, I'm sure!!
Francis will always be with us in spirit. All dogs go to heaven, and I know that he is watching us. Thank you for sharing such a big part of your life with all of us.
Cooking with dog has had an absolute positive influence on me. After the passing of my dad in early 2015 my life downspiraled so much that all my hobbies died. My boyfriend began taking care of me. I watched cooking with dog a lot in that time, and now, cooking became my new hobby. I added a lot of other cooking channels to my list, but CwD will always make me happy when I see it pop up on my subscribed channels. Keep it up, we love it!
Chef, we thank you, for francis and for ourselves you continuing this channel! I'm so glad that you will continue, and appreciate so much the videos. Thank you, so much, Love from Brazil!
Thank you Chef! Francis is watching you from over the Rainbow Bridge, so happy that you're cooking and making videos again. We love you Chef! <3
So glad videos are still being made!
So great to see a new video from you wonderful people. Thank you for what you do. I appreciate your hard work and the strength it takes to continue in something that must be so hard to do after your loss. In a way "speaking for many I'm sure" its our loss as well. I look forward to your next video and again thank you. You brighten my day, and are an inspiration to me.
Thank you for sharing another recipe with us Chef.  Please take care of yourself.
I lost a dear friend last year as well. It is hard but important to honour their memory by continuing to live life to the fullest. Great to see you back in the kitchen.
Thanks to all the wonderful Cooking with the dog team!! Francis will always be here, we'll never forget him.. Thank you chef for keep teaching us! Love and a big hug from Ecuador to all of you!
We'll continue to support you, Chef! Keep your head up high!
シェフ、ありがとうございます。心が痛みます。このクリを使ったおこわ　ぜひ作ってみます
Stay strong, Chef, we love you ♡

Lots of love from America ♡♡
Burst into tears when you said you would be happy for Francis. Thank you for all of your beautiful videos and staying strong for your fans.
Im so sorry chef, thank you for another dish even tho it must be hard still to do this with out Francis. But he is still with you in spirit and will be missed. Thank you for making cooking with dog.
Chef, you are a beautiful woman.
<3
Lost my dog around the same time, love you Chef. <3
Chef, you're absolutely wonderful.  Thank you for all your hard work and dedication.
May the aromas be lifted to dear Francis' nose in Heaven
I've been watching this channel for about 8 years now, so now I'm crying at the intro :'(
Thank you for continuing with the show.
My tears came out when I saw her again and Francis only in the picture.  Anyway, I'm very glad to see you again, Chef.
Dear Chef, thank you for igniting a passion for cooking. I owe it to you and Francis for having fun while cooking. I'm sure Francis is in Heaven and is eating as much as he can while playing.
Couldn't help but tear up while watching the beginning of the video. This is the first channel I subscribed to back in 2008 and it's still my favorite since.  Chef, thank you for your courage to continue making videos. I cannot imagine how difficult it must be. I am grateful for your hard work! As long as there will be videos coming out, I will be watching them! Sending lots of love from Canada!
I love you. thanks for this dish. love you francis
It is very nice to see you back chef. Thank you for the video. It looks delicious.
omg i miss the litle dog TT 
I watch this since i was in high school and now i'm about to finish college and that makes it worse :C
Chef, you are very brave. Thank you for the wonderful video. We love you chef! You made Francis proud.
Chef! Please hang in there, and thank you for continuing to make videos and share your wonderful smile with us. We've missed you and Francis very much! We'll understand if you need more time to heal - we want only the best for you. <3
My cat recently passed away and I just start crying :'(
Well, I guess I'm gonna go sob in the fetal position for a few hours now.
We will always love you Chef and Francis 💟
-Love from Philippines (I sobbed while watching this)
I'm so glad you uploaded a new video, Chef! Regardless of whether you get a new dog or stay with the Francis plushy, I will support your channel always :D
Seeing Chef in a video made my day. This was a pleasant surprise!
Wow they did what I recommended! I'm so happy chef is keeping Francis by her side, watching over her in the kitchen like always ❤️ R.I.P Francis we all miss you soooo much! 😭❤️🙏🏻 sweet doggo I would pet your lil' head if i could, instead I'll pet my doggo in your honor❤️
Thank you, Chef, for this wonderful video! We all miss Francis too...
Dear Francis, Miss you!  You and your Mom were my first subscription to Youtube.  Love you lots, Ally
I was wondering how many pre-recorded videos were left until I saw the picture... 😢
We love you chef. R.I.P Francis.
So happy you are back Chef. Our sincere condolences from Canada. 🍁 It's wonderful to see you again. You make a LOT of people smile Chef and we felt your loss deeply as well. Please know we did love Francis too. Now we come for you and the delicious food and I am especially happy to see you are back. Welcome!
we love you chef. please keep being strong<3
Now is one of those times I really wish I could hug a person through a computer screen.
WE MISS YOU, FRANCIS!!  AND WE MISSED YOU, CHEF!!!  I had to pause, take a few breaths, and fight back some tears when I saw a photo of Francis sitting in his place.  Even if it's a bit more emotional, now, it's still a pleasure to see another video from you, Chef ^__^
10 seconds in and I'm sobbing like a baby. I think its admirable that chef has the strength to smile and make this video even though you can tell there is sadness. Thank you Chef. I hope you are taking care of yourself! We love you!
thank you chef for your strength an courage it is because of you i started cooking far better than i had ever done arigato
My dog passed away last year, too so I understand the feeling of losing a family member (in the end that's what she was) and having to be strong in front of the others because not everybody is able to understand how it feels like. I felt like doing nothing, I've been sad for months and thinking about it now still makes me feel sad. So I really admire Chef for trying to go on and cook. I will always love and support this channel :)
Thank you Chef! Francis is still his fans beloved little guy! Take care!
I MISS FRANCIS SO MUCH
Okay... i am so outdated. I love you francis, specially you chef! Stay strong. Thank you for being my mentor since age 11 😭❤️
It makes me super happy to see you still making videos. Francis would never want your amazing and inspiring cooking to end.
Stay strong, Chef! Francis may have finished his time on earth, but the love he felt for you and that you felt for him will send forever. We're also here to support you and give you strength in all your future endeavors, no matter what you decide. Those who love us are never truly gone. Much love from Brazil.
So happy to see a new video from you guys!! <3
I'm so glad your channel is continuing
Thank you for continuing to make videos!
Here come the tears...T___T We love you, Francis!
Thank you Chef for continuing to make  videos. Francis would be proud! This is really wonderful!! Stay strong! 🙋💕
Still my favorite cooking channel :) R.I.P. Francis <3
Stay strong Chef and thank you for making this video too
Chef, hope you are doing well.  Even thought Francis is being missed so dearly, we hope you continue his legacy.  <3
I can still see the sadness in Chef's eyes throughout the video ;_;
OMG Francis </3 Stay strong Chef.

Also, i know it's been a year but does anyone know if francis appeared in vids after his death? like pre-filmed vids
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Chef, you honor and allow us to honor Francis by continuing to make videos of delicious recipes. Thank you so much!
Oooh it's so sad not to have Francis here, but I'm glad you decided to keep uploading recipes. Thank you very much.
I loved that you used Chopin, as in the old times.
chef: thank you so much for the great video.
francis: we miss you buddy. thanks for watching over.
I miss your videos a lot, greetings from argentina
I have been watching you for many years now, chef! Thank you so much for all of the recipes and for this episode, for sure. <3
Everytime I see Francis' photo I feel so incredibly sad. Like there's something heavy inside my heart. 
But it's great to see you again chef! I hope you smile more as time passes. Everything will be okay and Francis is having fun up in heaven. :)
RIP Francis I hope you still chilling in dog's heaven .
Francis will be forever in the heart of us, cooking lovers around the world! Thanks for everything Francis!
Keep up the good work, Chef! <3
I've been watching this channel for over 7 years, It's horrible to hear that Francis has passed away. It's not the same without Francis, Chef you do what you do best! Although Francis' presence isn't physically there, he will watch from the heaven's above. I will still watch no matter what! Chef, many of us will support you no matter what!
ganbatte ne, chef ! thank you for continuing the video 💕
You are doing so well, considering!

We all love you Chef and wish you happiness and well being. Thank you for bringing us such joy.
My heart is comforted to know that you still continue the videos,so keep going Chef and never give up 😌
The picture breaks my heart...
Thank you so much chef, for continuing with making videos. May you be healthy and receive the love you deserve <3
This made me tear up! Im so happy you are still cooking chef for us chef!
B-but dog was... the spark of the program... poor chef she was so happy cooking with her dog :'( we will miss you Francis, rest in peace.
Thought I'd chime in with all the other good words. Thank you for keeping up the channel. Lost two cats last year to cancer and diabetes each, so I understand the pain and the need to move on while remembering the good. You honour us and Francis' memory. Be well!
Thank you for being strong Chef. I will keep supporting you and your videos regardless of weather you get a dog sometime or never do. I Iove your videos and your passion for cooking. :)
Thank you Chef for the video. I think Francis would be very proud of you. Thank you for continuing the videos, they are the light of my day when they come out. <3

Somehow, Chef looked like she's in pain the entire video. :(
Welcome back Chef ♥️ We missed you! Ty for this great video. It looks amazing and I can not wait to try it!
thank you for continuing to make videos ❤ Im sure it must be hard, but all of us are thankful and love your recipes!
So beautiful! I'm enjoying each video. Thank you, chief!
30 SECONDS IN AND I'M ALREADY CRYING
Looks so yummy!!! Thank you chef for making more videos!!!!

Thank you so much for everything you do <3
Really glad Chef is back making new videos. it's a nice way to remember Francis, I'm sure he's watching from above :)
Welcome back Sensei, I missed your videos so much <3
I feel soooo saaaad but so hungryyy that's a bad combination. 
 FRACIIIIIS x'd x'd x'd omg .... I'm always gonna remember you.
Oishi des! <3 Continue making wonderful Videos chef! (:
Please take care of yourself chef! As much as we love your videos, we are also worried about you so if you need some time we'll understand and continue to support you!
This looks delicious! Glad to see you back, Chef. I know it must be difficult <3
I'm happy to see you again, Chef : )
Thank you Chef for continuing to make videos, I understand the sadness, please don't strain yourself if you need a break from time to time.
I deeply respect your choice of keeping Francis as the host of the show, even as a sort of spiritual guide! I lost my dog several months ago and people keeps on telling me how I should take another one with me, but it just doesn't feel right as I am still grieving and picking another dog as a "replacement" would be disrespectuful for my late pal and the new one. I'll know when I'm ready and maybe you'll know too, for now thanks for keeping on posting delicious recipes! Love from Italy ❤
why is a cooking video making me cry
Welcome back chef! I missed this show so much! I really hope you'll continue making this incredible show even though your lovely dog passed away. You are incredible, thank you so much for working hard on the show!
You did amazing Chef and team!! Francis sure is proud of how strong you are and thank you so much for continuing to teach us noobs some great dishes to make for ourselves and beloved ones! <3 <3
Substituting spring onions with the many onions the ninjas are cutting around me

I'm going to try this one maybe tomorrow! I have everything but the chestnut and mushrooms! This one looks so good. I miss Francis but I also very much missed the chef. It's always good to see you and the pictures of Francis all over is both sad but very heartwarming.
We've missed you so much, thank you for coming back, Chef! This is the greatest tribute to Francis. Love this channel through and through.
Bravo Chef.....so glad to see you are going to carry on posting videos.  I very much enjoy watching you.
this was like one of the youtube channels that I started watching videos yt. is it weird to feel kinda sad while watching a cooking video??? but I'm glad chef has come back. it felt kinda nostalgic watching this I hope chef keeps doing awesome recipes :)
following your channel, I changed completely my eating and I have more control of my weight far from fast foods 
Please don't stop, you are great

Omg no I've been watching these videos forever... I didn't know he passed :( so sorry for your loss chef. Thank you for continuing these videos. The picture of him made me sad but also happy at the same time. Rip francis 🐶💕
omgoodness.. i had to replay the beginning a couple of times to make sure i really hear what chef said about Francis.  😢
Had to try very hard not to cry at the beginning of the video. I know how it feels to lose a beloved companion. We had to say goodbye to our dog aged 14 on the 22nd Dec due to a brain tumour and stroke. 3 months on and I still expect to see him when I come home from work :(
thank you chef for doing more videos. take care of yourself ❤❤
Thank you Chef for continuing with the videos and teaching us how to make wonderful recipes! Greetings from El Salvador :)
I'm not crying, I'm just cutting so many onions!!! 

Thank you Chef for continuing to make videos for us in Francis' honor!

Thank you, chef.  You are appreciated by so many of us.
I have not been keeping up with this channel for a while (life got in the way). I am very sorry to hear about Francis, he will be missed.

The recipe looks delicious, and I will be sure to try it!
Thanks chef for continuing cooking even without the dog! it must be hard to cook without Francis! But i know francis is very happy to see u are still enjoying food from above. please keep posting more videos! looking forward to more yummy goodness!
My cat, Marth, passed away a couple of months ago. He was 12. My best little buddy. There's a video of him eating popcorn on my channel, and I'm glad that I recorded it. He liked to watch videos of animals, and he enjoyed watching Francis whenever I'd play an episode of Cooking with Dog. :)

Francis was very lucky to be so loved. I'm sure he enjoyed every minute of his life. Much love to you! <3
Thanks for come back. I always support you, chef
I admire you all, Chef and family, for staying strong and continuing the channel. You will always have your fans' support! Francis was a very good boy, he'll forever be in our hearts❤ Much love and prayers for you all!
I cannot believe my eyes when I saw this video, so happy to see Chef again. My son and I were just talking about the channel because we are planning to cook some salmon recipe from your recipe. I hope Chef will continue cooking in memory of Francis, thank you for making this video!

It's been such a long time since if watched cwd and I had no idea Francis had passed away! I'm so sorry Chef. I know what it's like to lose a pet. My thoughts go out to you ❤
The stuff chef said at the beginning just broke my heart
i'm so happy you are back chef ;;-;;  thanks so much and welcome back.
Thank you Chef for the video. So good to see you and Francis' picture and to hear his "voice."
how come I never knew Francis passed away?!!?
This recipe was so good and delicious, I've made it twice already! Thank you very much for sharing!
お久しぶりです。フランシス君がいなくてさみしいです。私も同じ頃に19歳の猫をなくしました。フランシス君がそばにいなくて、頑張ってるシェフさんお姿。涙が出てきました。フランシス君、お空からいつも見守ってくれてますよ。💖
I hope you're doing well Chef!! ❤❤ We all love your recipes.
Thank you for this video chef, I send you my condolences. I wish you happiness.

Thank you for returning to us chef. Your show is gentle and comforts me. I think Francis would be happy you are still cooking.
Francis may not be here with us but I know he's happy up in doggie heaven. I was kinda worried about chef after Francis passed away.  I'm glad that she uploaded a new video. Really appreciate it!
so sad :( but thank you for keep making new videos
I've lost my poodle Fuffi 4 months ago after 16 years together and i know the pain, chef <3 I cried also for Francis, i loved this cute dog! 
I hope Francis and Fuffi play together in heaven <3 
Thanks so much, chef, for your videos. Love from Italy
Great job on the video. I'm so glad that you made another video. That recipe looks so good.
Thanks for this new video, chef! Francis would be proud of you.
I hope this channel lives on, like our dear Francis.
It is so hard to lose a beloved family member, particularly one as wonderful as Francis. As a long time viewer, I mourn his passing, and have really missed your videos. You have always inspired me to cook better, and given me such great tips and ideas. Thank you so much for continuing! ♥ I admire you for your strong spirit now, too!
Thank you so much for continuing the videos!
Chef you are so strong! Thank you for this new video, we all love you very much and appreciate that you'll make more videos for us

To Chef-san and Narrator-san: I understand your pain, and feel it too, since I lost my best friend, my cat, in January. Her name was Misaki. But you're right in saying that Francis is looking upon you from Heaven. I really wish you can feel better very soon. I'm sending you a big hug from Colombia.
So glad to see you back making great cooking videos!
When Francis popped up in the beginning I just broke down. Thank you Chef ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you Francis ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you Chef! We love your videos and greatly appreciate you continuing these lovely videos.
He sure is watching from heaven, thank you for continuing your show, Chef and Angel Francis ♥
I wasn't looking at the screen when I heard the little tune from the Zojurishi rice cooker, and had to check to see if my wife was making rice.
Gambatte Chef. Francis is smiling from up above. :)
Chef, you're so brave! Keep smiling! がんばって！
Chef, you're so brave! Keep smiling! がんばって！
Dearest Francis doesn't want his beloved Chef to be sad. Brave face well done Chef!
Sending lots of love to Chef! Stay strong <3 I cannot eat shrimp, but my boyfriend loves shrimp, so he will love this recipe! ^^

its OK ! I'm not crying I'm just sweating from my eyes 😭💔
So glad to see you back in the kitchen Chef. And yes Francis is still with us all who enjoyed his presence in your videos. I hope as more time goes by it will be easier for you to cook. Todays recipe was inspiring if I had had chestnuts in the pantry I would be preparing to cook it now . Looking forward to more videos.
I'm very very very happy to see you again! Let's continue while always thinking about our favorite chef!
thank you chef for keep making videos 😊💚
THIS IS THE MOST UPSETTING THING. But im so happy chef is back...

me: ah, another one before Francis passed on. 
sees picture where Francis sits 
Me: NOPE.
Never thought I'd cry over a cooking show. Must be the onions
フランシス天国行ってしまったんですか。残念です。フランシスのことは忘れません。今までありがとうございました。これからも料理楽しみにしてます。
It was so hard to get through this video without bawling my eyes out, Francis will always be in our hearts and memories for years to come, we've got your back chef!
Best wishes to you and the team, Chef. We all love you! Thank you so much for bringing us joy through those recipes <3 <3 <3
.... thank you for doing this.

OMG! I cried a lot with this introduction. I`ll miss him!
Thank you so much for keeping this channel going. I didn't find out until I left the hospital in June that Francis had passed... and I thought that you would end the channel. I'm so glad you decided to keep going with this. This is my favorite youtube channel. :) Thank you for going. I'm going to keep watching.
I cried. Sending chef all the love and strength. Ganbatte!
From 0:12 to 0:29:
IMPORTANT MESSAGE
RIP Francis. Hope Francis knows we all miss him!
Chef, you are so strong. I miss Francis too... 💔
Francis would be very proud of chef for carrying on. Surely he is in heaven watching over her. Perhaps he is with Idella (see avatar), and they are eating and playing  -pain free and free of old age, waiting for their humans to join them someday.
thank you for all your hard work~~ francis will always be in our hearts.
Keep it going Chef~~ Francis' spirit will always be with us and in your lovely kitchen <3
Thank you Chef for continuing to make videos. I found your channel about five months ago and was saddened to hear about Francis but even more heartbroken that the channel considered ending videos. I love learning about Japanese cuisine!
Thank you for posting this vid despite Francis passing.... Arigatou gozaimasu.
Thank you for your hard work Chef-san I will smile for my Luna as well who crossed the rainbow bridge two years ago. I still miss her.
It really is good to see another video from you, Chef. Thank you so much for doing what you do.
You are such a wonderful family and I am so thankful that you were on my computer screen for almost 10 years. Thank you for continuing to make videos for your viewers and we will do our best to be happy too! :)
This made me sad. I feel like Chef's heart just isn't in it anymore, like she's trying not to cry--and I completely understand. I feel like it's almost cruel to put this video out anyway. :(
I'm happy to see you back. Ganbattekudasai!
実は四年前から見てた
悲しいなぁ…
Thank you chef! You are the best. I really appreciate that you continue to make videos even afterwards Francis has passed away. This is for hin
I've been a faithful watcher for 8 years, I think it's time for you to take a much needed break especially during this hard time. Take care of yourself chef!
初めてまして^ ^
こちらの動画かなり前から視聴させて頂いてます
フランシスは帰ってくるもんだと思ってました…最後のクーンって声聞けないんですね

And thanks for such an amazing recipe as always. This is my favourite Japanese dish! ❤ Love Cooking with the dog. From London

So glad to see these videos come up. I'd love it if chef released a recipe book. There aren't many cookbooks of authentic Japanese home style cooking in English.
Please take care of yourself too chef. Gambare!
Thank you, chef, I hope you know how much we all love your cooking videos. I've actually been watching this show since I was about 11, it's been six years since then and I'm still madly in love with your videos. Thank you for staying here with us after everything
Thank you Chef for cooking for us again. We miss Francis and he will always be in our hearts!
It doesn't feel right just having a picture of Francis there, but I'm so glad you're still making videos. :)
Lots of prayers & love for Chef & family! <3 I will make this dish, remember Francis, & smile.
So happy to see you back. I teared up on what you said about Francis. He's loved by so many here! Take care, big hugs!

Aw Chef, I'm so sorry for the loss. Take as much time as you need off if you decide. Much love ❤️
Il miglior canale di cucina di tutto youtube 😄 felicissima che siete tornati  🎊 ❤️️❤️️❤️️
Thank you for continuing your wonderful videos.  Francis was a wonderful companion and will always be missed, but I enjoy learning Japanese cooking just as much from you.  I wish you well.
Well, this was sure a pleasant surprise!
Chef! That looks delicious, thank you for continuing to make videos
Much love for the videos <3 Stay positive and take care of yourself!
That part where she says she'll try to stay in good spirits to keep Francis from being sad absolutely devastated me..
Chef please continue to make videos for us. Francis will be very happy watching you cook. Take care Chef!
that intro made me tear up 😭
thank you your the best 😊
Thank you very much for your strength and your presence, chef. We appreciate you continuing to make videos. We miss you very much Francis. <3 <3 <3
OMG I didn't know about Francis! I'm so sorry for the loss of your special loved one. 😢
I held my breath at the end hoping to see a "coming soon", I'll understand if someday you aren't able to make any more videos, but I'm so happy that you continue to share your recipes with us. every video is a gift 💜
Welcome to come back !  We know how painful you were. Thanks for sharing the cooking video again.
I'll miss Francis, but I'm glad that you're making new videos! Keep up the good work, I appreciate it ♥
Thank you for continuing to cook for us despite your loss. We will all miss Francis!
we ❤ you chef!!   be happy again.. francis is happy in heaven..
The end made me sad. No more Francis antics. :(
Whaaaaaaa? How did I not know Francis passed away??? My heart hurts so much rn. Stay strong chef.
Gotta love that Zojirushi sound!
oh my gosh, Chef-san's back! while we all miss Francis, i'm glad this channel will continue on, as i bet he would've wanted this too! thanks so much!
I am so happy to see your new cooking video. Thank you
looks so delish! Francis photo was a heartful detail, it is always good to see a new vídeo of yours.
Thank you for continuing to make videos!
Chef, thank you so much for keeping up the good work despite your loss. The world would have suffered a much greater loss had you stopped sharing your culinary guidance with us.
Wow...I haven't heard the Chopin music background in awhile for this channel. It really reminds me of some of the older Cooking With Dog videos when Francis was still very young :'(
awww chef, if it makes you sad then maybe it be a good idea to take a long break from this or maybe even stop making videos. We will miss your videos but its heartbreaking if making videos will only give you pain. <3 ♡ ❤
we'll support you chef!
Chef :( im tearing up already
It's a telltale sign how far advanced Japan is in electronics when he mentiones the rice cooker's settings. Mine has two settings: 'on' and 'warm'. 


RIP Francis! What terrible news :c I had a feeling he was on his way, he was looking more discheveled as the years went on.
Welcome back, Chef! We are all looking forward to new delicious recipes. Francis will not be forgotten.
Chef,
Thank you... My family and I send our love. Please take your time and don't rush. Your fans will still be here. Again, thank you.
This must be hard having Francis gone. But whatever happens we will always support you and Francis even if you two are apart from each other. We shall always remember Francis.
Thank you, Chef!
I am beyond happy to see you again. I missed you so much.
Thank you, Chef. I'm certain that Francis is happy to see you cooking and bringing his fans another video to enjoy.
I'm crying in the club
YAY! I am absolutely delighted to see your return. I certainly miss Francis' sweet demeanor as he watched you (or napped,) but with time you will continue to bring knowledge and enjoyment to many such as myself. Please do continue, my girlfriend bought me a Francis apron and I promise to wear it proudly!
Başınız sağ olsun
I'm really glad you all are doing more of these.
Lo siento mucho!
En casa también perdimos un peludin de los 8 !ya se encontrarán  en el cielo!
saludos
Just asking... where do we get the Francis plush?
Francis had been there with us for this cooking show and growing up together with me. Thank you Francis and chef please take care and Francis will continue to stay with us in even he is in heaven
美味しそうです。小さいスパチュラがかわいい！
thank you chef, keep cooking!
the picture, I'm just crying so much.
#sleeptightpupper :( still awesome vid
I had no idea he died until just now. that's so sad. rip buddy
Everyone here supports you, chef!!
thank you chef for your sweet soul
It took me thirty eight seconds for me to start crying. Especially since I just woke up.
this is cool that Francis is helping on the other side of the rainbow bridge just like a spirit guide PS I am not making fun of Francis nor his mom I to know the pain of losing a fur baby was my cat of all days it happened on feb 14th.
i've been subscribed to this channel for many years so this video made me really sad
genuinely made me cry lol
I love you guys. I have been watching for so many years and enjoyed following your recipes. My dog passed away early this year and I can only imagine how painful it must have been to make this video.

Thank you for this recipe!

I really appreciate it and you guys for taking the time to do it. I love you so much and wish you a good moving on from this very sad event. I know how hard it is to keep going on without your best friend.

I will always support you guys.
What??Francis passed away? I'm so sad right now ç_ç
I cried so hard the first time I've watched this video, still crying today.
I was so happy to see a new video from you chef! We all miss Francis so much, but we still have you, and we are so grateful for that!
I'm sorry for your loss. :( Francis will definitely be missed. Keep on going with the show, chef! <3
Francis how I miss him so much :'( hope he is making amazing meals in heven
❤🐾
😔😔😔
I hadn't heard about Frances. So sorry for your loss, Chef! Frances seemed like he had fun cooking with you.
Oh I didn't know Francis passed.. But he would be so happy that you are making more videos.
i love chestnuts in rice but i hate cracking them open to get the chestnut meat out :<
I know losing Francis was very hard, but it is good to see you continuing with this charming series.
I always watching your show :D Im so sorry for Francis :(
I'm shocked to see Francis is gone :(
I'm so sorry about Francis' passing. He will forever hold a place in all of our hearts, thank you so much for sharing him with us.
フランシス亡くなったんですか！？
わからなかった😭
天国で見守ってくれてますね。
Keep up the good work!
(ノಥ﹏ಥ)ノ❤❤❤
francis! we missed you so much ! may you rest in peace.
You've made me happy. :D
待ってました。料理の勉強になります。
thank you for still making videos, chef. and keeping the good memories alive
Thank you for the new video. Francis will be so proud of you for putting a brave front. Please take care of yourself.
Sending love from my household. We love you guys.
Sweet Francis we love U 💝
No dog can replace Francis. He was such a wonderful dog and he'll be missed by many. We're here for you Chef. Maybe not physically, but spiritually. I wish you the best. :D
I never thought I would weep over a cooking show, but here I am. Chef, I hope you and yours are doing well, and perhaps are able to take some solace in the fact that both you and Francis have brought so much joy and knowledge to many.
Nice to see you again chef - from the States
You have no idea how much we appreciate you continuing to make videos, despite the fact that Francis is no longer with us on earth.
I will make this in honor of Francis.  He will be missed.  :(
Aww.. I'm so sorry you lost your dog. You will see him again. <3 from CO, USA
The beginning of the video made me cry. This isn't an overreaction. I've been a fan for a long time and my Nona is going through something similar were her dog is dying. I've known that dog for a long time and it hurts to see Chef trying so hard.
thank you for the new video chef
Thank you, Chef and Francis
We love you chef! =)  Hope you feel better soon
食べたいー(・¬・)ｼﾞｭﾙ
Thank you for all of your wonderful videos Chef .  We care about you very much :)))
</3 Oh, my heart
OMG I had no idea, I'm so sorry for your loss
Oh no, I miss you Francis :'(
I want to cry😭
My condolences I see this show every week is not going to be the same without Francis but thanks chef for the effort  <3
love you chef. keep you head up. Francis would want us to smile and eat delicious food
So great to have you back! <3
Lots of love to you chef ♡ I bet Francis is very happy that you still cook and share your passion!
It's so good to see you. I'm so sorry for your loss.
I'm deeply sorry for your loss, Chef. Thank you for making all the videos you have over the years and teaching us all how to cook such lovely dishes, I hope you can continue to make videos even in Francis' absence. And, of course, if you need more time to grieve, that is perfectly fine. Take care of yourself first, always. Thank you once again, and much love for you and everyone else behind the channel as well 💕
my deepest condolences to you chef. I miss Francis deeply.
Happy you're still making videos for us, thank you.
Ooooooh!! I am going to miss that walking rain cloud. I cried abit...I love animals too much. He was a good little chef and mascot. I felt that if he was there, I would feel at ease. That I can cook at my best. We will miss you Francis. We will miss you Chef Francis. (´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
(´；ω；｀)ﾌﾞﾜｯ(´・ω・`)
(´・ω・｀)(TдT)(TOT)
your channel has always been heartwarming
Its nice to see you again. I cant help but cry at little at Francis's picture. But at least hes not suffering anymore. All the love and support you have from all of us is amazing. I hope that it helps in feeling better. Much love. Thank you for being brave and coming back it makes us happy too.
Omg...I miss the dog
Thank you for still making videos, hope Francis will be happy to see you cooking as before in heaven :(
We love you dear Chef and we appreciate your effort!
sad she's gone my condolence.. thank you for all these videos.
never stop crying Chef love you guys
it must have been so hard for you, chef :(
Chef we love you!! Take care!!
心中お察し申し上げます・・・

以前のような、シェフのチャーミングで素敵な笑顔の動画を楽しみにしています
Like many others I had to take a moment from the video is process my feelings about Francis. Seeing the opening picture and hearing Chef officially address Francis' passing...was heartbreaking. I have lost pets before and it is still a mark on my heart when I think of them. I still tear up thinking both about how much I love them and how much I miss them. I cannot imagine how difficult it is to keep going but I am touched that Chef has come back. Thank you
I'm so sorry for the loss of your fur baby Francis. He was such a sweet dog.
Happy to see you again. Even Fransice is now in heaven, he would be in our hearts forever.
We love you, Chef!
this was such a sad introduction to this channel
NOOOOOOO FRANCIS 😭😭😭😭😭
I share Chef's heartbreak.   My beloved Rascal Dogg unexpectedly died about the same time as Francis last year.  I will miss him always, as she will Francis.  This channel is STILL my favorite cooking show, & I hope Chef will continue to share her tasty recipes with us.
i'm so glad cooking with dog is (hopefully) continuing! i miss francis but i would miss this show too!
Looks delicious! Can't wait to try it. (Sorry for your pain - We, too, lost one of our beloved Pugs Aja in December - she was 15. Our hearts were broken, but we are happy to have had such an amazing friend and companion. We'll light incense for Francis - such a gem.) We love your show. 🍲🍚🍛💯
Thank you Chef, for doing your best to make Francis smile in Heaven and also to continue bringing us wonderful recipes and instruction. I loved to see all the images of Francis, it made me smile with a small tear in my eye. Soon my mouth was watering over your cooking again! Very well done 😊
Love your cooking no matter what
IM SOBBING
頑張ってください。
私もものすごく応援します!!
新しいレシピや料理を待っています!
Ahh this recipe reminds me of home. Delicious! We will miss Francis
ありがとうチェッフ！
I'm still in tears, but this looks so delicious T_T)
they can buy/adopt other dog :(
oh i just know francis is died :( keep strong  chef and keep making a new videos ok
hello from Indonesia. new to this channel. excellent!
This is so sweet. We love you <3
im actually tiring up and this is the first vid i have seen from cooking with my dog
Cooking with Dog should someday get another dog, and name him Francis the second:D
thank you chef ♡♡
*hugs*
Thank you chef for making new videos. We all loved watching Francis and you in the kitchen. And wish you the best of wishes.
Ganbatte, Chef!!!
I made this but subbed the pork with shrimp, delicious!
Chef, I know you said that you wouldn't want to bring in a different dog but I think Francis would want you to rescue a dog from a high kill shelter, a dog who's time is running out.
NOOOOO FRANCIS!!!😭😭😭
You bring great honor to Francis and your family. So nice to see you back.
Welcome back, Chef!!!
I cried a little in the beginning, but I will do the same as chef. Everyone smile for Francis!
Thank you for uploading a new video, Chef. Francis was loved and I'm happy to know you and your team are keeping up the good work. I'm sure he's happy too. お疲れ様フランシス.
I can't imagine what it must feel like to lose a companion as loved and held as dearly as Francis. I think I speak for the wide majority of your fans when I say: We love and apperciate everything you do, Chef. You are a marvolus woman. Francis was the star we had all comed to love so dear, but you are a beautiful star just the same. 
Keep doing what you're doing. Take it one day at a time and remember that you are loved. So very much.
That BROKE my heart. がんばって、シェッフさん！信じている～
hayyyyyyyyy quâsáááá
miss you.. welcome back.
No, no, no etc (Tracy Morgan voice from Cop Out)
i'm cryi ng
She is trying so, SO hard.  Even though she said she'd do her best to do it as cheerfully as possible, you can just see it in Chef's eyes.  That sadness over losing Francis.

God, it hurts, it hurts, IT HURTS.  I want to hug her so bad and cook HER a meal for once. ; A;
oh i was late knowing what happened to francis :(
Aww I really miss the squeal Francis makes when the chef tries the food at the end of every video <3 Please keep making videos! We will always support you no matter what!:D
This news make me watch all your videos again. We miss you Francis...
ありがとうございます, Chef. I couldn't stop myself from crying. I imagine how sad you are, and I appreciate your effort to make more videos. Thank you very, very much. I love you!
welcome back chef!
Thank you for helping us cook from heaven Francis. You and chef taught me how to cook when my mom could no longer teach me.
So happy to see Chef again!!!
Its still so hard to accept that Francis is gone, but he will never be gone in our hearts
So good to see you are back!
待ってました。また見れて、凄く嬉しいです。
I'm so happy that you are interested. We are all thinking of Francis and remembering him as we watch
Hope you feel better now!TT
I hope she finds a new pup to love and make new happy memories with. Im sure Francis doesn't want her to stay sad
love you so much chef!
😢 i missed francis🐩
Oh, so sad to hear Francis passed away 😢
ありがとうございます！We miss him dearly, but thank you so much for teaching us, Francis. thank you for going forth, Chef..!
We lost our best friend Dou Dou last year as well. I understand how hard it is to have your best buddy past away. But we know that our memories of our friends are been cherished everyday even though they are no longer with us. I hope the you will feel better. I am a big fan of your show and loves watching you cook with Francis. And we will always remember him! Ganbatte!
Thank you chef ❤️
Me and my girlfriend appreciate your efforts, please keep teaching us your delicious recipes! We miss Francis, too.
Hello, chef. I am new to the channel & had the unfortunate timing of never getting to really know about Francis & yourself till now. Luckily I have the massive archive of videos to remember Francis by. I hope one day, once you've healed from the loss of a true companion, you can also reminisce by watching the videos you guys made together :-) Whether you continue this channel or not, thank you for sharing Francis & yourself to us.
TT_TT <3
R.I.P francis but im so glad you still makes videos. thank you chef.  ありがとうございました
Pobre Francis Yo Lo Quería :'
Chef still doesn't look cheerful :( Very understandable... Don't overwork yourself if you're still feeling down! Take a longer break if you have to! Losing Francis is like losing a precious family member.
お帰り。いつもヴィデオの事有難う御座います。お元気でね。
This looks DELICIOUS!!
rest in peace, Frances, you will be missed.
Thank you for staying with us, chef. We miss Francis but we would miss you too if you stopped making videos. Stay strong. Everyone is here loves you.
Francis is missed and he made good memories. ❤️ Glad to see you again, Chef!
So she finally cooked the dog. I'm sure it was worth it ♥
Francis is narrarating from heaven ❤
poor Francis🐩 😭
Yummy and easy.Thank you for sharing.

It's good to see you again, Chef! We care about you just as much as we miss Francis! 😢 Please take care of yourself and continue to do your best! My doggy was my best friend, he went to rest a couple years ago and I miss him so much. So I'm sure all of us will never stop missing Francis either, but we'll still be here to support you and the channel!
That rice cooker is part of the 1%
Francis!!!😢
Francis 💖
I'm crying..
I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW OLD HE WAS TODAY AND I GOT A BIT ANXIOUS AND I COME BACK AND HE'S DEAD I WANNA CRY

ฟรานซิสสบายไปแล้วยุบนฟ้าแล้ว
❤❤❤❤❤
Sorry for your loss ❤
Francis will be missed.
cry baby cry
I'm so happy to see new videos. The picture of Francis was a nice touch.
I began to tear up when Chef began to speak.  She sounded down.  Wish I could give her a hug!
If it's too hard, you don't have to make videos anymore Chef. I was so happy with everything you and Francis gave us....after 8+ years watching your videos, it's okay if you don't continue. You will always be in my heart and I'll never be mad. I love you! You are so strong.
I recently lost my cute little white poodle Astro. It sucks but I had to put him down. We will all miss Francis and thanks so much Chef for making videos again!
I cry everytime :'(
Glad you are back. Francis is with my two dogs playing in heaven.
cutting onions :("""

I watched this channel when I was in college (2008-2012) and am so sad finding out that Francis passed away... RIP Francis!
You're back😍😍😍❤️
and here I was wondering why I didn't see their videos for a while in my feed 😭😭😭 fck that's not even my dog and I feel like sht rn
I think it is time to bring a little bit of happiness back in chefs life.
I suggest going for a puppy
Sorry to hear Francis passed away.  Miss him.    Again, great dish.
we love you, chef
I've been way too busy to keep up with this channel in awhile and I just now found out what happened! I'm distraught. I'm so sorry you have to go through this, chef. . . .
Gambateh !
Oh my god
😢
遅くなってしまいましたが、フランシス君今まで本当にありがとうございました。
シェフの丁寧なお料理と、いい子で見ているフランシス君の動画が大好きでした。フランシス君は天国で、元気に見守っていてくれていると思います。これからも動画を出されるのは大変だと思いますが、無理をなさらず頑張って下さい。
私もこれまで同様、動画を参考に、シェフの様に丁寧な美味しいお料理を作ります！
ちょっとうっとうしい
ワンちゃん、亡くなったの？ショックです。
That is so sad! Francis passed away! 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😤
im your big fans
.....Im' fucking cry....
me: stop crying stop crying stop crying stop crying
Thank you, Chef.
I took a long break because hearing of Francis' passing hurt too much, but as I came to try and finally watch some videos again my heart just broke all over again. I'm happy he got to live a long, healthy life and even reach so many people and help introduce people to delicious food from another county. It won't be the same without him but I'm glad that the show will continue on.
Yep, crying.
Great new video! Looks really tasty and easy. Thank you chef :D
I mss Francis
Sorry to hear that Francis passed away. At least he's forever immortalised within these videos. Chef and Francis have been amazing, and it's so awesome seeing how big your channel has grown over the past nine years. Please stay with us :).
Is this the voice of Francis II?
kukin with da dogu
wow this was painful to watch.
Chef looks so tired, and her smile isn't as bright. Please take as much time as you need to mourn, knowing we're all here to support you.
ご冥福をお祈りします
:'(
RIP Francis
R.I.P francis
Francis memorial!
If we dont have access to Dehydrated  shrimp, frozen on would do?
これからは写真なんですか!?
😭😭😭😭😭😭
No matter how savoury the dish it will still be bittersweet
I've been watching this show since I was in high school; I'd always been into Japanese culture, but this really got me into the cuisine aspect of it. That eventually pushed me to start learning even more and now I've recently made the next step into learning the language. Take care of yourself Chef-san, give yourself time to recover. We really appreciate the effort put into the videos, and even if Francis is gone I'm sure it would make him happy to see you keep going :)
i had no idea Francis had passed away :(, sorry for your lost and good luck in the kitchen.
If Francis was dead in the last year but why I still saw Francis in the steak and garlic recipe
I'm so hungry right now.
😥
crying
Thanks for every new videos!!!
anybody know what pan she's using? it looks so good
no one will ever replace Francis, that is a definite fact. but we hope and we wish that you will overcome your grief and will be able to feel a little happier down the road. I know Francis will want that
がんばってね!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Are those prawns or crayfish?
Sad to hear this news... rip Francis.
いつも楽しみに拝見しています。フランシス亡くなってたの知りませんでしたTT
残念ですが今後もWITH　DOGって事で続けて頂きたいです。

ご活躍をお祈りいたします。
it makes me very happy to see you guys at it again. And at the same time i felt so sad :(
FRANCIS PASSED AWAY!!!! NOOOOO
I'm SO deeply sorry for your loss.  I haven't watched your channel in a while and I'm so shocked to hear this heartbreaking news!  We all loved Francis very much!!  I just lost my beloved Sheltie of 14.5 years this past December, and I miss her terribly.  I actually used to watch Cooking with Dog, with my Sheltie laying beside me, and she loved listening to the nararrator and the music.  My heart and prayers go out to you!  Rest in peace, Francis.  You were loved beyond words!! xox
It's good to see you Chef! We know it's hard but everyone really appreciates you making videos.　有り難うございます！！
i am so very sorry for your loss though i never meet Francis in real life i loved him.
Thank you so much, not only for the video, but also for continuing. It means so much to see you return. Much love and support to you, Chef.
Francis i will miss you :'(
RIP Francis :(
Sending love from Utah, USA. あなたのかなしみはわたしのかなしみ。<3
😭
Yay!! Make more videos!!~~
sounds very good
RIP
ご愁傷様です。
So is this channel done?
She look so sad :(
I just found out. I'm so sorry. Hope you feel better.
I'm not crying, I'm not crying, I'm not crying.
We miss you Francis
シェフは強い。一年より過ごしても恵美ちゃんの事忘れなくてニャミダが時々降るにゃん。
恵美ちゃんはフランシス君と一緒に遊ぶかもにゃん。
その辛さ分かるから一杯応援しますにゃん。
シェフさん！頑張ってください！
フランシスもきっと天国でビデオを見てくれてると思います！正直にフランシスが旅立ったビデオを見て私みたいなあんまり関係なさそうな人もすごく一日ずっと落ち込んでました☹️
I started ugly sobbing when I see the Francis photo. Stay Strong!
I hope you get another puppy. Francis would want you to be happy and share your love
do you really cook with dog?
So nice to have you back, chef. And again with a delicious dish. I'm always happy when you publish a new video and can't wait to watch.
I want to give Chef a big hug
Please get a new Frankie!
We love you, Chef! がんばってね。
Chef - if I could I would give you a HUGE hug. You, Francis and your team always made me happy with your videos and even thought Francis went to run somewhere else now, you still make me, and I am sure a lot more people, happy!! Cheer up, we all love you!! いろいろとありがとうございました
Is it possible that Chef got Francis from a Poodle breeder?
If so, why not just get a new Poodle from the same local breeder? I know it's hard to move on without the original Francis but, to stay happy you must continue to keep yourself happy. In the end I'm a proud Francis fan even if Chef decides to buy a new Francis pup. ;)
OMG Soon she Will die too
I think Francis in heaven is very proud of you Chef. The recipe looks delicious! But we can see you still look sad 無理しないでください
longtime at I see  you channel and  something doing and i click in your channel.since I'm a teen you and francis is make me attentive to japanesefood and I practice from you. now I'm 30 year old l like to cooking japannese and doing always. I want to say  you and francis is my first  teacher  and i will remember a francis Forever.
Chef 😭😭😭😭 she looks like she has lost a lot of weight too~
がんばって!最高の仕事を続けてください
how did Francis pass away😭
A broken heart due to pet loss will be only replenished fully by getting another pet. I know Frances will feel the same way, that is the reason why pets lives are so short. I said this to many people and many had done so to be happy again. We love you Chef.
🌈🌈
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY where i have been for a very long time :(((
かわいいフランシスが隣でニコニコしてお料理を見ているような気がしました。また動画が見られて幸せです。シェフさん、どうかお体大切になさってください。また動画楽しみにしています。フランシス大好きです。
Oh no! Francis!! T__T
am i the only one who crying like a baby while watching this video?
i like your rice cooker
Oh my god what!??? Francis passed away!? Oh no!!! How did I miss this! Oh the poor darling....but he had a long and happy life, and he was an internet star. All my condolences go out to you, Chef. Francis will be missed <3
Im never unsubscribed to you!
I miss Francis :(
2003-2016?
2016 IS THE WORST YEAR EVER THAN 2012
Is anyone else crying? :(
先生 度もありがとございます。

awesome video!
very nice!
Greetings Ela
What, Francis died?? :( I didn't even know.
Chef, I don't know how to put this without sounding rude, but I'm told it's best to get a new puppy as soon as possible after a dog passes away. I know he'll never be Francis, but he'll cheer you up I'm sure :) I can't say for sure if it works as I wasn't able to get a new pup ever since my dog passed away over a year ago, but either way I wish you all the best, you are wonderful people :)
This rice dish looks very delicious :-)
The dog ia dead?
シェフさん色々おせわになりました！フランシスさんがいなくてさびしいです。だけどあなたのレシピはいつもおいしそう！ビデオを作り続けるのためにありがとう！私は大ファン！
Wtf Franics died?  Noooooo
Thank You chef. !!
does someone know the name of the classical music in the background!?
Crying
Even though it wasn't my dog or I never met him I shed many tears watching this video. I'm terribly sorry for your loss Chef. I know how hard it is because during my life I said good bye to two of my beloved dogs and I know how hard it is and how ripped apart your heart is right after your beloved friend dies. When the sorrow goes away think about his legacy. I know that he was one of a kind but maybe you should adopt a Francis JR. so you won't feel alone on the set of CWTD ;) Cheers from Warsaw, Poland.
頑張てください！！！
Welcome back, Chef. Is there anything we can do to help you? Some subscribers may be able to help provide different language subtitles, or browse through your archive and catalog what you've done so it's easier to come up with new ideas (I'm willing to do part of it). I'm refreshing my Japanese language skills but I'm rusty - 20 years since learning. Anything else? Please ask
Sorry for your loss.
Im sorry but i came here only for the engrish
Francis died!?
I'm not sure if your ready yet but, you should get a new puppy! After my dog passed away we were really sad and depressed without a dog so we get a new one 3 months later!
U are in my thought
Aw the dog died
Francis passed away? T__________T im soooooooo sorry. Spain (all the country) is crying. Hope you will get better :*
C
What a sad video. I'm not hungry anymore. Chef still looks sad and looks aged. 
I am really sorry for you! You look older and sad. Hopefully, you will feel better soon. You will see Francis again in heaven
Omg 😭😭😵😧😭😭😭😭Francis died💙💙💙💙💙OMG🐩
Did they delete videos previous to this one? it seems a couple are missing.
How did Francis die?
Glad to see you back again, Chef!
Chef, can you start bringing another dog? I don't mean to be insensitive, and if you're not ready for it I understand. I just need to know that you aren't alone.
i still feel bad for francis, i feel ya, my dog died about a week a go
Chef looks so sad while cooking. My condolences. Please keep up the good work, and I'm sure Francis is proud!
私はフランシスが亡くなったことはとても残念です。私の家族は、コロラド州にここで彼を欠場します。Google を使用しています翻訳;下手な翻訳をお許しください。
Poor Chef.  She looks really strained.  You can tell she wants to be happy for us, but this just reminds her that he's not here anymore.  I hope that you get another dog, even if you never have him/her on this show.  You need a baby to love.
stupid Japanese
You might not see Francis but Francis is always beside u. Francis doesn't like to see u cry so please smile and be happy! ^_^
I think this is the best way you guys could have dealt with it. Looking forward to more videos.
Should you get Francis II? IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A HOLOGRAM OF FRANCIS?
Yay! It must be difficult to do these without the sweet presence of Francis, but, these videos are so delightful & life affirming that they are a wonderful tribute to a loving companion!
wait, is sweet rice distinct from regular sticky rice?

yeah Francis is like a kitsune, he doesn't have to stop narrating just because he's dead
are you thinking of getting another dog??
I kind of want you to get a new dog because it will make us happy to see another dog 😢😢😢
i like everything about these videos except guy's accent.
They should have gotten a different voice for the voice overs bc it's too hard hearing Francis voice. I just want to cry every time I hear Francis's "voice".
Why can't they still make videos with the picture on his place? I don't think my heart could resist missing Francis AND Chef :(
Feeling sad for a Dog while preparing meals with slices of another feeling and living being. Oh Humanity....
I cried in the beginning. I'm happy you continued. I've turned vegan because of my love for animals. Could you feature some Japanese vegan food sometime? Love you!
I think chef should start different show, so she can stop being reminded of Francis all the times. Instead only doing this cooking once a year on his anniversary. 😊
I cried a bit when I saw the picture, god I miss his cute face in the beginning of each video. Without dog this is not cooking with a dog, hope you find a dog close to Francis.
im confused as the voice over is still the same!! wtf!!? shouldnt the voiceover for Francis be changed ?
bring back the plush francis! also i want to buy one
It's not too late to cook with the dog.
Get a cat. They live for 20 years.
Cooking without Dog
so you don't remove the shells of the chestnut during cooking? interesting- I was expecting the chestnut to do something with the flavor
She looks dead inside, i give 6 months give or take left for the show
I expected them to get another dog
omg.  this is creepy...  i just want to watch some kind of cooking, not a dead dog watching back.
welp! this channel sucks now without the dog. time to unsubscribe!
please dont stop making videos, we all love your recipes
a lot of star animals passed away in 2016.
Buster Beans the Vine Star.
Gabe the Dog the Bork.
Francis the Dog Cook.
I don't mind if it becomes "Cooking with Chef". If cooking and sharing recipes is what you love, don't feel pressured to stop just because Francis has passed. If you want to take a break for personal and emotional reasons, by all means please go ahead and don't worry about us. Your fans will not be upset if you do not get another dog. Share your recipes when you feel excited to. The happiness of Chef and Narrator are most important.
don't feel pressured to keep the show going if you don't want to, chef. I know it's tough losing a loved one, so please, do what makes you comfortable.
So sorry. you will always be the best Japanese cooking show. Arigatou gozaimashita!
We all miss him :'(
this is tearing my heart apart </3
the last message made me cry. :( I understand though. Please live a healthy and long like Chef!!! We love you.
poor franchise I'm sorry for hearing that 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 but we still believe in Francis he's the best dog
I always enjoyed your videos.  Whatever you decide to do, I'm rooting for you!
I miss him. I hope you're both doing well. Thank you for the happiness and the great video.
I'm sorry to hear of Francis passing. Please continue the show. I'm a big fan.
sniff

Chef sure is cutting a lot of onions in this recipe.
RIP sweet Francis <333
No please don't stop making videos. IF you don't feel right using another dog you can use the Francis plushie. I don't want to see you leave.
While the real Francis will always stay in our hearts, I certainly don't mind having the plush Francis to be the host! I really want to see more recipes from Chef!
Will still be supporting your channel regardless on schedule👍 Stay strong Chef
im sure francis and gabe the dog are together in dog heaven either cooking or making sick bork remixes, good night sweet princes
So sorry to hear about Francis. He will be missed dearly!
virtual hug for chef
Now when i cook these recipes, i pour a shot of mirin or sake out for Francis. Hope you continue the show Chef, but i understand completely if not. Much love and good feels to you all. Hope everything works out well, however it has to.
Looks delicious! Always glad to see a new video in my subscription box.
Thank you for the many recipe videos! They were really enjoyable. 
１０年　ありがとうございました！　新しいビデオを作れなかったら。。。悲しくなるけれど、分かります。
Rest in peace Francis <3
can you just keep near you the yarn mascotte and continue to keep this channel? I'm a fan for many years and I will be sooo sad if I can enjoy your recepies anymore :(
RIP Francis. We will never forget you xxx
I'm currently cooking and re-watching old videos from this channel. The recipes changed my life and help me cope with clinical depression. Thank you for being with us for so long Francis. Stay strong Chef! You both inspire me so much.

Francis is irreplaceable but so is the show! Please continue for the sake of Francis and all of the people who loves the show (maybe with the Francis doll? 💖💖)

Love from Indonesia.
Im crying and Im watching a cooking show. 😭😭😭
I hope Chef and all who loved Francis are doing well. Please continue to make videos. We will greatly miss Francis and understand not replacing him. We still love the videos. I hope you continue.
He will forever live on in our hearts! We love you Francis!
Thank you for all the years of wonderful meals. You have shown me many Japanese dishes I never knew existed.
I still love you Chef! ❤️
I really hope you keep cooking Chief, for your sake and Francis R.I.P
I cannot believe she told the Francis plush and the Francis in heaven (hence why she spoke to the other side of the plush). This is so sad I can't take it!
I am sorry for your loss. His spirit will always be with you.
If you don't feel right continuing the show with another pooch, we support you. Whatever you decide in the future here on out: thank you to the entire crew of the show for everything you've given us. For me at least, it's given me so many useful recipes which I use on a regular basis. This show's been wonderful, and added many recipes to my repertoire.
Oh nooooo, don't stop making the videos... The plush Francis is a great idea, everyone knows him already, and he will forever stay as the symbol of this channel :-)
So sorry you had to say goodbye to your little companion. Francis was an exceptional dog and has made me smile so many times. Your videos are to me more than a cooking show, they are like a piece of home. I have grown up watching your recipes and they resonate with me oh so much. It is the musical composition, the colors of your surrounding and the dishes themselves that mean "love" to me. Know that you always have my support. I will keep you and Francis in my thoughts. Sending you much love. Xx
Looks delicious, I hope that one day you find an other cooking companion like Francis (he was a fantastic doggy).
Please upload more videos if possible, this is my favorite cooking channel!! I love your recipes!!
We finally caught up to the videos before he passed. Man.
RIP Francis.... 😭 you and chef have made me smile so many times!
We all love you and send our love from all around the world Chef!
I've never been so early! I miss Francis :( I'm so glad you're still making videos chef! 💙
Francis will be missed😢. He was my favorite part of the show besides the food😘.
please don't stop making the shows.
rest in peace, francis! we'll miss your fluffy goodness... ;~;
Chef, I just want to tell you that you and Francis have been an inspiration to me for so many years. I've been watching your videos since the beginning and fell in love with each and every recipe, and with Francis! Seeing a plushie Francis both hurts and brings me joy. Joy because his memory will live on always! Hurt because I know he is gone and it must not be easy for you to continue making these videos without him, but still you continue to do so. You are truly an amazing person, Chef! Thank you for all the recipes, inspiration and everything else you do! <3
In my opinion you have the BEST cooking channel on YouTube!
I would appreciate frequent updates on the chef. how is she doing? what has she done since the end of the show? did she have grandchildren who watched? etc...
I'm glad she's always in high spirits
Francis RIP so sorry...
I'm so sorry Followed from the first. 
Thank you for making a small smile. 
It is encouraging to you.
Keep healthy fightingggg
Even though we won't have regular videos from Chef, I hope that we can have the joy of watching her cook again soon. I've been following the channel for many years and would love to see more videos in the future. But it's not my channel so I will respect the decision of Chef to not continue if it's too painful. :( we love you chef!
Thank you so much for the videos, the enjoyment i get from them is incredible. Everybody loved Francis, you can be so proud on the show and Francis!
I'm happy to hear you'll still be posting even if Francis is gone, please don't stop. we love Francis but we also love your recipes, and it would be such a shame for it to peeter out.
Hi Chef and Mr. Voice Over, I've been watching your videos for years and it has been a joy! Please continue to make these videos, I think Francis would be proud that you can continue to share these recipes with us!
awwwww I am sooo sorry!!! we miss him already! hope you are OK though.
Oh my gosh! Chef! Please don't stop teaching us amazing and delicious recipes from Japan!
I hope you guys can come up with another video format that you feel comfortable with.  Through that, Francis' memory can live on.  ^-^  Thanks for all the recipes Chief!  I know I appreciated them a ton!  :D
I am actually crying to hear that Francis has passed. The bow at the beginning made me explode with tears. 
Your fans love you and Francis. 
Thank you for the videos.
o~o bye bye Francis >~< I would have been sad to see another dog in his place, so I think I would have done the same thing... i am sad to see them go though, because this show was very heart warming and homey to me... I made some of her recipes and people really loved them >~< Thank you so much Cooking with Dog ありがとうございます >~< Good Luck in the Kitchen!!! o~o
I understand your choice and I support it. Francis was an invaluable figure in this show indeed and I can see why you wouldn't feel right to upload as you did for so long. I will still enjoy this channel and watch the previous videos (and any you may sometimes upload in the future) in order to remember the good times that were had here.

Much love and condolences from way over here in the U.S. (Texas to be specific)
I'm happy to hear that you will be bringing more recipes to us. Thank you for deciding to continue to introduce new Japanese dishes.
I think we're all going to miss Francis so much and I can not imagine how painful it must be for all of you, but I still hope the show stays active. I believe that continuing with the show is even a form of homage to him ...
Oh my, I just can't watch these videos without crying. 😢
I really miss Francis but please don't stop making videos, we all love your recipes and look forward for more!
Please don't stop making videos I love making this food for my family and seeing there reaction to how good it is
So sorry for francis❤❤ we'll miss him. Pls keep making yt videos with the plushie🙏🏼🙏🏼 i love the way this is shown and narrated
oh Francis TT^TT RIP we will always miss youuuuuuuuuu
Miss Francis too!
Dear chef! Today morning i saw your video and i was very sad becouse Francis passed away :-(
Please accept my heartfelt condolences!
All the best from a big Fan from AUSTRIA!!
i love chicken and your recipe it's amazing, congrats, come and watch my recipe, i'm sure you like!
I miss Francis such a sweet dog. RIP buddy 😚
Chef and Francis have been an irreplacable part of my youth. I've grown up attempting many of your recipes and creating fond memories because of them. Thats why I will support any decisions you, the creators, have. Francis was a great companion for chef and i believe most of the viewers felt positive connections to him as well. Good things must come to an end eventually. But they don't necessarily need to be sad when they do end. Thank you for providing such great content while Francis was here. I look forward to any future plans you have. Thank you!
I am so sorry for your loss! I always enjoyed watching Francis in the background and hosting the show. I will miss you recipes for sure, but completely understand. I send my best wishes to you and the team! <3
This video made my day. So happy to see the chef and Francis again. But pls pls don't stop making videos. Your videos and recipes are so great and we love to continue watching! It was more than just cooking video. Your videos always brought such joy and love. Have a good break and please come back. You will be so much missed. Sending lots lots of loves xxx
NOOOOO!!! Don't stop making videos!!! ; A ;
Like the video to pay respects to Francis the Dog
:( rest in peace Francis 
you were my favorite show host :(
This so sad :(
But Francis had a happy life and he died for old age,i hope Cheff is better and make more videos in the future with another dog or Francis plush.
I think I'm going to cry on every video with out Francis. Deepest condolences. Things will never be the same but I do hope you continue making videos. Sending you love from the US.
The message at the end broke my heart, but it's completely understandable. I will always love your content!
Im sad to hear that you will be doing less videos but I;m glad you aren't stopping altogether. Sending love and well wishes from Canada!
Can I also mention how both Francis and the Host haven't aged since they started? Their recipes and love and warmth will always stay in my heart.
I am crying! it's so hard to lose a part of your family :( and if i was bawling when i found out francis died, i cant imagine what chef might be going through. stay strong, chef! we loved Francis, and we love you ❤
We love you Chef, do what feels best. Thank you for all of the lovely videos you and Francis shared with us over the years.
I wasn't expecting to see a video of Francis at the start of the video :) that made my day!
I'll think of Francis every time I cook ;-;
I like your videos very much, but I found the opening to be almost comically blunt.

Music plays "Daaaadadadadadada theeee doooog is dead"
Thank you for sharing Francis and your wonderful cooking with us. Rest in peace, sweet Francis.
Francis was one of best host in my life ;-)
Rest in peace Francis <3 I will still watch the show. I love your recipes! Take care!
Continuing the show only keeps beautiful memories of Francis...
ペットも人間も同じで代わりなんて居ないです。フランシスの事は忘れません。次のレシピも楽しみにしています。
i'm happy to see you making more recipes! we'll always remember francis. he was a good boy.
No!!!! He was such a sweet and patient dog. 😢
I miss Francis but I love your videos! So please never stop!!
We love you ❤
If you decide to end the show it's ok, very respected decision
it breaks my heart... thank you for all the wonderful recipes and entertaiment all these years , Francis and Chef
Oh noes! Francis.... <3 forever in heart!
We loved you Francis & we love your show...please keep us entertained with more of your lovely cooking videos! Rest in peace Francis <3
Dear Chef,
Whatever you decide, please know that we'll always watch your videos. Obviously, it saddens us that you wouldn't be posting videos as regularly as you did but we understand that it's because of Francis's passing. It wouldn't be the same without Francis but please know that we also came here because of you. You're just as close to our hearts as he is. More power to you and your team.
thank you for the hard work, chef and sorry for your lost.
The show must go on!!
2016 strikes again. I'm sorry for your loss 😢
It's so nice to hear sweet Francis's "voice." He is missed by all his subscribers.
i love the recipes a lot more than the other content and im sure many would agree with me that you dont need to get a new dog or have any kin of replacement but just continue as you have with the stuffed animal
though of course its all up to you and i will continue supporting your channel and recipes
Condolences for the loss of Francis from a long time viewer.
Cooking with dog is my Favorite japanese cooking channel ... please continue making more delicious cooking demonstration
Oh no Francis is gone 😭 I'm so sad......
oh my goodness.. I am so sorry for your loss. Francis was an amazing dog, and although he is gone he will always live in our hearts.
shes such a trooper i dont want these videos to stop 😭
We all loved Francis more than anyone could know. I know I did anyway. We completely understand how long it will take to be at peace with her passing. Feel free to take a break from YouTube. We all love Francis and I am crying. RIP Francis- chef's dog and all of our dog in our hearts🌹We love and miss you so much and will forever be known as an inspiration, and host of Cooking With Dog. You will never be replaced ever.
thank you for all the recipes, Francis! rest in peace, you were very loved! i hope the channel keeps on, even without Francis. maybe we could have a tribute video, with the story of the channel... I've been watching for so many years, but know so little about you guys!
legends will never die..
I cried when I saw the Francis plushy he was such a  cutie and now he's in doggie paradise 💕💕
I find it nice that the very first video was sukiyaki and now the last ever video with Francis is also a take on sukiyaki
Its ok we understand. Hope that chef can post recipes on her own. We still love chef. But can understand if its not comfortable to do. Thank you for all the amazing foods you and Francis made. We will always have them to remember.
So sad. Francis was such a lovely dog.
I enjoy these videos a lot as someone who loves Japanese food and cooking. I've learned a lot about regional dishes, and thanks to this channel, I have finally made passable 豚の角煮. 

That being said, I respect Chef-san's feelings in this and want her to do whatever is best for her. Cooking should be an act of joy; love is the best seasoning, after all. 

Chef-さんありがとうございます!
So very sorry for your loss. R.I.P. Francis :(
Chef, you always look so gracious and cute! I miss Francis dearly, so I can imagine how much you should be missing him too! Please continue cooking delicious Japanese recipes for us to honor Francis' memory! Hugs and love.
My heart breaks for you </3 Francis will be truly missed. I really look forward to your next video! Thank you for sharing with us and making the world a more beautiful place 😭
I have been following your channel since my college days. I remember the first dish I made from your channel was Oyakodon, it was absolutely delicious. I am sure you have changed many people's lives in some ways, big or small, and hope you find solace in knowing that your videos have been a source of inspiration and joy for many.
Thank you!

P.S: I do hope you will continue making these videos when the time is right :)
so sorry for your loss of doggy. :( I will miss him. Love your video's.
I love the music, it made me feel really excited about her putting that chicken into the pan.
in a way i feel a bit better that francis won't simply be replaced. i still am looking forward to whatever cooking episodes you release going forward without francis because chef is a great cook and i hope she keeps cooking!
WE'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
I'm so sorry to learn about Francis. He was obviously loved. Whether or not you decide to continue the show, good luck in the future.
first it was Francis and now gabe
Please keep posting often! Even if it's just the toy version of Francis, I still want Chef to spread food to the world!!!
Dear Chef, 

I discovered Cooking With Dog quite a few years ago now and instantly fell in love with the concept and easy to make delicious recipes. I am grateful to you and Francis for your hard work and fun videos. Even though Francis is gone now, I will continue to support you and look forward to more tasty dishes in the future. Best wishes!
Very sad to hear Chef will not continue, I agree Francis was irreplacable but will miss you and look out for your recipes xxxx
I've been watching your channel since the very first day it aired. Thank you so much for these wonderful recipes and sharing Francis with all of us. I hope you know how much you've changed the world for the better simply by existing. Wherever you next in your projects, I will happily follow.
RIP Francis 😢💔
Please do not stop making videos! My children and I love you guys! I am so sorry for your loss. He was such a good boy! Our hearts go out to you!
I nearly leapt out of my seat when I saw that you uploaded a video
Thank you for continuing to share your delicious recipes with us 
Francis is dearly missed
Francis will live in our hearts, that's for sure =} <3
I will miss you and your nice videos, Chef.  Sorry to see you go, but I certainly understand that it can't be the same without dear Francis.  Thank you, and best wishes!

I hope chef will continue to cook with Francis watching from above 😢
Please continue making more videos 😭 I've been watching your channel since I was in my 1st year of high school. I'm now on my 2nd yr of college and still watch your videos 😭❤️
now that's love and value for your companion.
Respect.
Chef I am so very sorry that you have had to experience this. I wish you all of the happiness in the world. Francis was an amazing dog and we will all miss him greatly.
Instant tears. Didn't realize he passed.
Just when I was finally decided to catch up :(
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 im crying so much everytime you upload...
You were part of my childhood but now francis is gone.. RIP francis ;-;
I was about to relax and tried to watch this cooking show as always, but it made me so sad! we love you Francis 💕 still the best dog cook!! 💕💗💝
We'll miss you! 

Can anyone tell me what the background music is starting at about the 2.00 mark? It's really cool!
The intro makes my heart stop, then seeing Francis's plushy makes me want to cry 😔 
But I like to think he's still there watching & doing his own thing, being happy 😄
I understand your time to move on.  Francis would not never be replace.  a brand new start actually when u ready with other dog.  look forward to see your fresh cooking soon.
I want to make hot pot often, but I don't have a flame grill or electric hot pot anymore T_T
This looks so delicious and simple.
Chef and Narrator, please don't stop uploading
I love your recipes :)
I remember how tore up the fanbase got when chef was in her accident, please know that we will support you in any capacity we can to help you continue this project if you desire to.  Take care of yourselves and if you choose to continue with the videos, we will be here waiting!
Love the upgrade in production quality and I cook your recipes all the time! Love them!

I'm still so heartbroken after hearing Francis's passing. I'm glad you will still be able to post videos despite losing a legend. I hope chef is okay as well!
Wow, so sorry to hear bout Francis the dog passing. Cooking with a dog needs a mascot and hope you consider Francis !!. Your video series are very important to 1.3 cooks worldwide. Keep up the good work.
Thank you for all your quality videos. They were wonderfully entertaining and relaxing to watch. Francis and Chef are real stars, making the world a happier and tastier place. Best of luck !

When chef said "Francis, let's get started", I could hear my heart crumbled :'(
when Francis showed up I literally felt tears come to my eyes 😭😭😭 thank you Francis and Chef! I really love your videos and I have been watching them for so long and recreated so many recipes to share with my friends and family 💓💓💓💓💓

I'm so sorry about your loss, chef. Thank you for your video of great Japanese recipes. We respect your decision. RIP Francis, we all miss him.
I respect your decision to not continue regular videos. It must be very hard for you to do so without thinking of Francis and feeling sad. I look forward to the videos you do bring out and I'm sure Francis will remain in everyones hearts <3
Francis will definitely be missed, but I am glad you are keeping the cooking videos going in Francis' memory. The Francis doll is cute!!

the show: cooking with DOG must continue. we love your recipes. :*

yoroshiku onegaisulimasu. arigatou.

Long time no see you Cooking with dog
Love your show so much
I love mushrooms so this video is making me hungry. I'm very sorry for the loss of your beloved Francis. Keep us updated as you decide what you may do in the future.
Please do keep making videos. I loved Francis so much, but, I love the chef!  Your recipes and videos have taught me so much about delicious Japanese cuisine. Please I humbly ask you to continue.
I am so sorry for your loss.
condolenses from Israel :-(  im sure Francis had good and fullfilling life with you, please dont be sad for too long <3
This is the end of such a wonderful era.  I watched this show throughout my pregnancy, and while I was nursing and holding my first child.  It has become such a comfort for me, and I'm so glad these episodes are kept in YouTube for future generations, like my son, to enjoy.
 You almost felt like a Mother /Grandmother figure to us all, thank you so much for your contribution.
I'm shocked to know Francis has passed away, the show is never going to be the same without him. I'm very sorry for the loss. l love these videos, great recipes but sometimes difficult to find ingredients. Please do not discontinue the show, it must go on.
Please continue. I know it is very sad after losing a beloved pet but I'm sure Francis would want you to keep cooking. Your talents are at or exceeding Harumi Kurihara. Much love from Canada.
The cutest thing is ...she has all these cute momentos of Francis that keeps her smiling while cooking :)  Keep it up, we love you and we loved Francis very much <3
Rest in Peace Francis, we'll miss your sweet little face ✨💜
I hope you keep posting videos, I love your recipes. Plush Francis will be a great way to honour Francis.
What happened to Frances? My deepest condolences!
I'm deeply sorry for your loss😞 honestly, when my classmate drop the news about Francis, I was so devastated I couldn't continue working on my assignment for awhile. He will be missed </3
Omg, I'm so distraught with your loss! Please be strong in this difficult time! ❤️
Yeah, please dont stop and continue after some time. It was super good content of youtube. Greetings from Germany and all the best.
I only started watching your channel today. This is probably the 5th video I've seen and I felt so sad that Francis was no longer there. Please continue to make great videos!
I have an idea! Maybe you could use old footage of Francis and keep the narrator and have it be like Francis is narrating from dog heaven idk I just miss Francis 😭😭😭
i studied all my cooking skill from your videos i am so sad that  Francis was gone please don't stop we all love you
thank you for all your wonderful recipes over the years. you will be missed!
RIP FRANCIS!!! We will miss seeing you. Condolences to your family!! 😘
everything always looks so amazing!
I wonder if the reason for wanting to remove an 'unwanted' flavor and smell from chicken is something asians are more sensitive to, or if it's because their poultry is raised more naturally and thus probably has more of that gamey taste that we've mostly eliminated from our meat by feeding them a more bland grain-based diet (which I'm totally in favor of)
Thank you for coming back!  We missed you!
Francis, Chef and all of the staff have created so many recipes that were shared with us. Thank you for all of your hard work!!
Francis-kun will always be here, in Cooking With The Dog :') Rest in Peace, and keep cooking !!!
Love the show because of francis amazing dog and the delicius food♡♡♡
R.P.I we will miss you francis
why Francis had to go and not Trump instead :(
RIP Francis 💛
FRANCIIIIS D': May your cooking be delicious in doggy Heaven ):
thanks you for another wonderful video. I love your videos and try them out as much as I can. you are my favorite cooking channel and your videos always make me smile. we will all miss Francis but he will always be with us in your amazing cooking.
Feeling so sad about Francis' passing. Your memories will continue to live on.
when they brought out the raw egg 
me: "oh wtf"
Welcome back, Chef! Nice to see you.
Nooo, please don't disappear!  You don't have to replace Francis with another dog; you can use the stuffed Francis like in the last few videos.  Please don't leave meeee ;~;  You've been one of my favorite channels for nearly half my life!  *clings*
Francis passed? OH NO! im sorry :'(
My heart goes out to the cooking with dog family. Francis will be very much missed.  I wish the best for you all.  
I'm hoping you will pop in every once in a while as I see you as a dear friend chef!  Love and light. Aloha.
Get a cat?
wtf almost crying
WTH WTFFF
 WHAT THE ACTUAL FUUUCK
I am sorry to hear that you will not be able to carry on with the show. I understand, however, the gravity of losing a dear pet. My heart goes out to Chef and Francis' family. He was an amazing, well trained dog and a perfect accompaniment to your videos. I've learned so much watching you cook, Chef. Thank you for everything!
I'm missing Francis and I thought it means the end of cooking with the dog when Francis passed away. But I'm happy that chef is cooking more . Francis will be in good memory and I will try out your meals in myself. 
Love and Peace!
I am sad to hear francis passed away. I've been a fan of cooking with dog but hasn't been able to watch your vids lately. Rest well francis, i will continue to watch chef and the yummy food she cooks.
Chef I'm so sorry for your loss. He was a wonderful friend and family member to you. Please don't stop making videos. I love all your recipes.
We are happy that shouldn't replacing Francis. Please continue to make videos
I'm crying. I just found out today. RIP Francis you beautiful dog. Chef thank you for everything, you'll always have support
y'all this is so sad as soon as I saw that francis passed I away I screamed so loud and cried through the whole video omg I hope they don't stop videos because of this 😭😭
Even Francis is not here with us anymore, her would be in our hearts as always.
❤️
I hope you still make recipes even if Francis is gone. I can accept a new dog too
Francis may rest in piece!!! we loved that dog dearly :)
I'm so sorry to hear about Francis! I will miss him very much. I hope you feel better!! <3
francis we miss you :(
OMG I'm crying. :(
NOOOO Please don't stop!! I've been watching you guys from the beginning and yes he was important but we would love to still have you around!
Sorry to hear about Francis :( I will forward to your recipes.
thank you for the many years of recipes chef. rip Francis
I've been watching your videos for almost 8 or more years. I will continue to support you no matter what.
please make more recipes, arigato~
Is it just me or is the narrators accent getting thicker?
Losing our fur babies is so hard!!  Love you, Francis!!  I lost my Sheltie, "Kyla"  in December and I miss her so much!!  Francis will always be in our hearts!! xoxo
I'm so happy that you'll still use a plushie Francis as the host I love your videos Chef!
I felt emotional when I saw the note in at the begging, I cried when cheff said "Francis, let's get started"
Chef my condolences. Love all your recipes and videos. RIP Francis you will be missed! All dogs go to Heaven. <3 Take care!
RIP Francis. We'll all miss you. :(
Thank you Francis and RIP 😭😭 We will miss you
I love this channel, I'm glad you'll still make occasional videos.
Your show really made me so happy every time i watched it.  I hope that you continue to make a show in Francis' honor.  I think he would want you to do that.  I love you and I love Francis.  Please!!!
if you ever wanted to keep going with recipes, I'd love to see more with Chef they're really inspiring
;_; Miss you, Francis. Good boy.
Love your videos, chef! I hope you continue making videos when you can. Francis was such a sweetie and I hope you know how many love and miss him! So sorry for your loss.
It's hard not to respect someone's wishes when they no longer feel comfortable doing something, but surely it'd be more of an honor to Francis' memory to keep making videos then just stop and go sporadically.
Sorry for your loss.  RIP dear Francis 😢.  Thanks for all your wonderful recipes 💗.  I've made some and they were all tasty.
I love you Francis, I will never forget watching your show in Japanese class
My poor heart :'( I loved the video thou!!
Chef, thank you very much for this episode.  May Francis never be forgotten!
フランシス今までありがとう💕💕
love cookingwithdog forever
I miss Francis in your videos. I've been watching this Chanel since around 2011 and have seen Francis grow up and get new hairstyles. It's not the same without them
My husband and I have been watching for 5+ years now and have learned so much from you both. Thank you Chef and Francis!!
i really feel like thanking francis, chef, francis' voice, and all the team, for all their hard work. i really hope you guys can continue to bring us some form of quality content, if possible. thank you again for all these years, all the soothing moments, all the great recipes. <3
i miss francis! 🐶😭
My condolences to Chef and Narrator for their loss. Francis, we love you :-*
Thank you Chef and Mr Producer/Narrator for all your hard work and continuing good humour.  RIP Francis-sensei, thank you for the good times and careful instruction.

I would love to see you guys continue cooking as a YouTube feature in some form or another, as this show has always been an absolute delight to watch.   I wish you continued good fortune and all the very best in 2017!
It breaks my heart that Francis passed.  What a loss. But I also feel so saddened that you will not be continuing to cook. I have watched this show for many years, and I will miss you, and Francis.
I hope you are doing ok Chef ! I always have enjoyed your videos and whatever it is that you choose to do I support ya !
Francis is in my heart. RIP buddy.
Awww!!!! Rip Francis... you will be missed
i'm sorry for the lost. I hope you continue making videos. I love your videos!
Please keep making more videos ;n;
I hope you kept Francis' seed, so we may clone him.
omaigod, i just know that Francis is passed awayy
I've been watching you guys. I grew up watching you guys. I feel like you guys are part of my life. 😭😭 Life is unfair
Love your videos and recipes, please dont stop making videos!
my heart.... I love you and Francis I hope you're doing well! 😢 (Happy Lunar New Year!) this looks super good 😍 I might try making this! 😄
I had no idea Francis passed away. :( RIP Francis!
Rip Francis. You will be missed! 😢😢😢
😭 I start watching Cooking With Dog again after a few months..  and,  Francis died?  May he rest in peace..  ❤
If you haven't seen the Cooking With Dog Bonus videos you should, too freaking cute!
Thank you thank you so much for your dedication and effort all this time. Rest in peace Francis you're always in our hearts.
It's always heartbreaking when an animal companion dies. 
Pretty sure the chef needs to take a break and rest from time to time.
Francis was--hate to use past tense--a sweet dog that warmed our hearts and made us smile. Sleep peacefully, dear!
I'm so sorry for your loss and I wouldn't like to see another dog in the show.
I think I'd be fine if you would just cook, without anybody else.
Please continue your work on YouTube, because I'll always love your videos. I cooked so much of the recipes at home in Germany and I'm happy that you helped me with cooking my favorite japanese dishes over here :)
We extend our deepest condolences to Francis' family
I'm so sad to hear if Francis's passing. I love your videos and he was always so sweet. please keep making more videos!
Hi Chef, I'd like to know if you already have any Teishoku recipe vid? If not I'd like to request  that you consider making one for Teishoku pleeeease...I'm a long time subscriber of your channel. Many thanks! 🙂 ✌🍲
I'm so sorry about Francis 😔❤️
Fransic R.I.P. 😢😭
Deepest condolences to chef. Losing a friend like Francis is never easy. I'll keep watching as long as Chef feels like cooking and you feel like filming.
r.i.p Francis. thanks for the videos and memories.
dog???😢
I learned how to cook quite a few things from watching your show. Even if Francis is gone, we will remember him fondly. I hope we can still cook along with Chef from time to time, though.
I am deeply saddened to hear the sad news. Your video has been an inspiration to me. I am also a dog lover (though I have none at the moment but I used to have one when I was young), and I can understand the feeling of losing one before. I hope you are coping up well. Just want to let you know that, you have made a difference in many people life, I am always looking forward to watch your next videos.
Many warm wishes to you. Francis was a happy host and will be missed. <3
Thank you for everything you have made and posted in the last years! it was amazing and delicious :)
I am incredibly sorry for your loss and want to let you know that Francis will be sorely missed <3
Oh I didn't know poor Francis ; - ; he was soooooooo cute I loved how fluffy he was I'm soo sorry  ):
Well guys, it does say "coming soon" at the very end, so the show will still be continued. RIP sweet Francis! You will be missed
Thank you Chef and Francis for the many years of introducing me to Japanese cooking! I will always be a fan
The best thing for winter!!!
#HugAYouTuber, my deepest condolences on the loss of Francis. hugs
the shows not the same without francis
:(
the doggie passed away...nooooooooooo I really liked francis 😭😢😦
Miss you Francis. you forever live on in our hearts.
I'm heartbroken there won't be more videos, or as many, but I definitely understand. Cooking with Dog without Francis is just Cooking. I hope Chef and the Narrator can be happy again and love another puppy some time in the future when their hearts have healed, even if we won't get videos ❤
UMUMUMU. Francis is one of my favourite dog :(  He's not physically with me but when I'm watching him makes me happy 😭😭😭
I'm sad for Francis. Courage.
Thank you for all your wonderful videos, Chef! I'm sure filming this without Francis was very hard. I wish you all the best of luck!
I am so late, I've been watching channel for so long, I can't believe that Francis is gone ❤🐩❤
im sat crying i love francis :((
i cried for francis, i love francis and chef so much. :(
心からお悔やみ申し上げます。Dearest Chef, and sweet Francis, thank you.
the youtube community will miss francis dearly, but please still keep sharing your recipes!
I will remember you Francis and stay strong for the chef. I'm a forever fan of your Japanese cooking show. Faito dayou
I'm really sad that you won't be producing as much content anymore, but I respect your decision nonetheless. Your recipes have inspired me to actually start cooking proper food rather than just ordering takeaway constantly. Thank you for the years of great videos, I will happily watch any videos that might be released on the channel in the future <3
Dear Chef and Narrator, we will miss you, but understand that your hearts are hurting 💔 Have so much fun playing at the Rainbow Bridge Francis 🌈
It's sad that he's gone, I've been watching this channel since 2008, I've seen this channel grow and it's videos have greatly improved so much. I adored Francis since it was such a joy to see him besides chef. I will miss him a lot, but I like to think the Francis' soul went into the plush toy of him so it's kinda like he'll always be here with us ^.^
I am sorry for your loss & will miss watching Francis. I hope you keep making videos & I have learned a lot watching your videos. Love V
Thank you very much for your show! We are all very sad about Francis' passing. I hope you'll be well in some time, even though it hurts we will always remember the cute host of the channel! Ganbare!
Rest in peace Francis! May the bonito flakes be tasty, the dried fish good, and the takoyaki tasty! We miss you!
RIP Francis. We will miss you sooo much. And I'm so sorry for mama.
R.i.p. Francis. See you again at the rainbow bridge.😢
I'll always hold Francis close to my heart, i miss you Francis
I dont usually comment on videos but my heart goes out to Chef. I'm so sorry for your loss and hope that you are doing okay. Please know that we all love you and Francis and will continue to support you in all your ventures. Francis will live on in all our hearts
que triste que francis ya no esté entre nosotros,me gustan mucho sus vídeos,ya no será lo mismo sin el😢😢😢😢!!! mis más sinceras condolencias desde México
I didn't realize Francis had passed.  As someone who lost a pet a few months ago, I can only begin to understand your loss.  My girlfriend and I have been watching your recipes for a while now will enjoy your recipes even more as you put them out.  Thank you so much for what you do, and Francis will always be loved.
We'll miss Francis! Sending hugs and many thanks for such wonderful cooking videos!
it is wonderful to see you chef.  please, more recipes.
IM SOBBING
This is heart breaking, I'm going to cook this.
i love you chef! please stay strong... i ll always wait for ur new videos 😭😭😭
oh no oh noo. 😭 I was wondering why he stopped apearing in the videos. 😭😭😭😭😭
this is really sad... it breaks my heart that francis is gone
I hope chef is doing okay and recovering well, whatever she decides to do!!
Pls continue with cooking videoss!!!
I will always miss seeing Francis accompany Chef as she makes delicious food.  Please keep posting videos--I enjoy them so much!
I cried immediately when the chef said "francis-kun onegaishimasu" while bowed to francis doll and door :'( cause in my hometown we believe that the spirit of our loved one still among us to keep us save :'(
When she said "Francis-kun, let's get started!", I immediately started cutting onions in my eyes.
Awww😢I ❤️watching Francis. ❤️ all your videos.
Then don't replace Francis with another dog - just continue show with plushie Francis you had in this video. (Of course if you want and feel like doing it - if it's still to hard, then that's ok)
Thank god you recorded Francis' voice without it the show wouldn't be the same.
I've watched your videos since 2009. I remember watching and making a bunch of your dishes since starting college to graduating college and beginning my career. Thank you for being there for us (the cooking with dog fans) and for sharing joy and delicious recipes. We will all miss Francis but he will live on in our memories.
😢I don't know what to say, this video makes me feel sad. Francis will be happy in the haven, we all believe that
love your recipes! 💞 sorry about youre precious friend francis!
Our long time border collie passed away in November also.  Loosing a dog you love is hard :'(
I'm thinking of you guys today, I hope you're doing well. Your videos always make me happy :)
this probably sounds selfish, but please continue to cook :( I really enjoy your meals even without Francis narrating :(  rest in peace little doggo
My deepest condolences. Rip Francis.
Sorry for Francis, but we love your recipes. Chef do not stop. Use Francis puppet and good luck. Thanks for all recipes.
So sorry about Francis, praying for you.  Really sad about no new videos but I understand 😥 still have hopes for future videos.  Love from USA (South Carolina)
Oh no Francis... He will be missed :(
francis😢🐩🐶❤
I am devastated. First, for knowing this was the last video shot while he was alive. And second, for knowing we won't have more videos. Your show has been a part of my life. I have cooked lots of your recipes and waited for a new video every Friday. This heartbreaking. Thank you so much for everything. And I really hope you reconsider. Losing Francis was saddening... we can't lose you guys as well...
R.I.P. Francis. Hope u and my BiBi are in a better place right now.
Maybe you can introduce a new friend, or maybe a relative of francis XD
Francis will be remembered. 
❤️ -from your fellow viewers
Thank you for running this channel for so long. You inspired me to try cooking, and while not every recipe turned out perfect, with practice I began to make dishes I was truly proud of. This channel has opened up my eyes to the many different ways simple ingredients can be enjoyed together, and I'm grateful for all the work you put into it. I'm sorry about the passing of Francis. He was a great narrator and an even greater dog and will be dearly missed. All the best on your future culinary journeys. <3
We will miss you so much Francis. Thank you for educating and entertaining us on cooking these delicious dishes. Thank you to Francis's owner and family. Please do continue to do this show, I still love it.
This sounds really weird but with the narration and no Francis it feels like he's narrating it from beyond the grave
man... Francis.... it's hard to wrap my mind around his leaving...
This is so sad. I saw Francis' death on my Tumblr. I'm so sorry for you and your family. I grew up and learned how to cook for myself based on this show since I was 11 (and I'm 16 now). This is really sad ~ take as much time off as you want and need.
I understand Francis is in a better place😢😭😭.
I'm sorry for your loss. :( You were a great companion for him! I do however love love love your recipe videos!
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY #1 CHEF!!
FRANCISSSS!!!!
The show will never be the same without Francis, and I have no doubt your lives will feel empty too :( He seemed like such a happy dog though, and I'm sure he's still being an excellent host and food-tester in dog-heaven! Very happy to see you will still be uploading recipes, I look forward to every video <3
Thank you chef, I hope you are doing well :-)
Although I miss Francis, I was sort of hoping they'd continue using the nuigurumi. T_T
I understand your reasoning and I loved Francis on the show, but the show must go on, I hope you return with some more recipes :)
I miss Frances, it must be really depressing for you.....😞
im literally crying :( ill miss seeing that cute doggy
Francis we love you ❤️
AWWWW FRANCIS NOOOOOOOOO
I will miss you, Francis! Thank you for suck wonderful recipes. It is always a joy watching Cooking With Dog!
I just cried when I read the final message from chef and her team. I miss Francis so much.
I really enjoy the show chef, plz continue it. Francis is awesome but so are you chef
We all loved Francis and he'll always have a special place in my heart, but I also don't mind seeing plush Francis as the host too. I really hope that you'll continue to make videos, even if infrequently, they've always been enjoyable and helpful to watch.
It's so heartwarming to see Chef's smile again! I did start to cry watching this video, but I love it so much, even with the toy Francis <3 I hope that you will continue to make videos, we all love and support you, Francis became part of our lives, and he will live on in all our hearts, thank you so much for everything that you do <3
Rest in peace Francis. I've been a fan of the channel for years! Have fun in doggy heaven!
First I would say I never thought of cooking with my dog.  I think it's a good idea I am just now sure...
please continue cooking with Dog!  in francis' memory
I felt sad when the Chef looked around the room and said "Francis, let's get started!"
Sorry for your loss. I have really enjoyed your videos and delicious recipes. Thank you for sharing.
Even if there's no plushie Francis in the kitchen, I will still continue watching for the recipes.
Please continue making videos... We miss u Chef
no offence love your videos but it's not the same without the real dog Francis
francis 😭😭😭😭
I have been following this channel since 2013. I thought it was a fun ride seeing you guys grow within three years. Thanks for entertaining me til the end! Arigatou Gozaimashita to sayonara Francis!
Great and courageous decision not to continue the show in this format, but I would love to see the show to continue in a slightly changed format. You guys are doing a great job!
T_T I'm drowning in my own tears
Aw but Francis's legacy kind of lives on in this show! Definitely don't replace him, but have a token that represents him or something! Of course we will all remember him <3
美味しいそうです‼︎ 😋😋😋😋😋
i'm SO sad! my condulences to you guys! hw was adorable!
Francis was such a cool dog! 
My dog, a teckel, his name is Ronaldo, named after the brasilin football player, is now 14 years old. Tomorrow is his 15th birthday!
We'll celebrate this day, but I'm quite sure that this will be his last birthday. Our beloved pets leave us, and that is... so sad.
Please keep on you-tubin' - for Francis!
I am so sorry about the passing of Francis...she was a nice touch to this channel...we will miss her!! Please keep doing the cooking videos because I really enjoy watching them....
It's there any particular reason why the chicken is supposed to be cut at an angle?
The little stuffed Francis broke my heart ):
Please keep cooking! Francis will watch over us in spirit :) and as his plushies!
Francis will be into our hearts! Please do not stop doing recipes!
please continue this show ☺
Aw! so sorry to hear this!
So sorry for your loss. Francis had a great presence on the videos .
Francis you are in our memory T T
so sorry for Francis... thank you for share your world and recipies with us
We all miss Francis too and we're happy you have your old videos. They will be great memories for such a wonderful dog☺️
I hope you continue to make videos but if not I just wanted to say my hubby and I have been watching since the beginning. We love your videos and are grateful for everything. Francis was such a sweet boy and we miss him. I hope Chef and the family are doing well. <3
I feel like you should still make and record videos even though Francis is gone. A lot of people here come for your recipes.
please make more video i know francis will love it if  you guys continue with out him i know it hurts to lost someone u care so much i also lost a dog too and i very miss him so..
R.I.P Franics :C
I really was wondering if  this show will stop making videos.
 It doesn't ' t make sense if Francis isn't there, since they announced it then it is done.
Aww rest in peace Francis, you will be missed :(
So sorry to hear about the loss of Francis.  <3  All our love, chef!
I'm so sorry for your lose. Its awful losing a pupper <3
I hope that we can make you motivated to still put up videos. We all really love your recipes and we wouldn't know what to do if new ones stopped being taught to us. But with any decisions you make, we will be there for you!
Rest in Peace, run free at the rainbow bridge Francis....you will be missed....
Awwh I hope you are doing well Chef, We will all miss Francis :'(<3
Francis is missed.  I do hope you continue to make videos, maybe change the format a little and always have the plush Francis in the background somewhere as a memorial.   I will miss your videos if you discontinue uploading.
NOOOO :(
I hope Chef can still entertain us even after Francis loss. I totally agree that he is irreplaceable. My best wishes for all Cooking with Dog staff!
Thank you for your hard work!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I've been away for so long, and now I learned that Francis died. :'(
This looks so delicious, Chef!!! We all miss Francis. I hope you'll continue the videos. We don't need a new dog! Just Chef is enough <3
oh noooo Francis passed away 😭
havent watched this channel in so long and omg francis :'(( tq for still making lovely videos, chef!
Omg! I waited so long for this video!! Why did it take so long??? Plz don't stop uploading.
I completely understand that you dont want to continue cooking with dog, but I hope we can still have cooking with chef 😊. Pets are not replaceable. We may welcome new friends into our lives but they don't take the place of old ones.

今年も頑張ってください！
We will miss you Francis! So glad you are still making videos! This looks delicious!
RIP Francis 💕
TTWTT Francis-kun te extraño
We miss him too. :( may you rest in peace, Francis.
I started thinking about Francis' eventual death this year. It's been already so long since the show started... I knew it was coming, but it made me cry nonetheless. I hope you're not too depressed and I'm sure he was surrounded by love until the end. We'll miss you all a lot.
This Is so heart touching 
i miss francis 
you still smile even your dog died but i know your hurt😳
The spirit of francis lives on, I don't mind if we use plush francis as the host.
NOOOO PLEASE DON'T STOP! IT WASN'T ONLY FRANCIS WE ENJOY! HE WOULD WANT YOU TO CONTINUE!!!
Thank you so much for all the wonderful videos you've made. This channel is the most helpful and entertaining resource for Japanese cooking and I'm sad to see it end. I hope you will keep these videos available. You and Francis will be missed. Good luck in your future endeavors!
im crying.
I love your videos, you're the first channel I ever subscribed to, no one will ever replace Francis, but we love chef, and mr narrator, even tho Francis isn't here physically anymore, hearing that voice that I've grown to hear as the sweet little poodle, brings him back, as if he were still here. I would still love your videos with chef, plushy Francis and Francis voice. There is no need for a replacement. He lives on through his voice and in our hearts. If you do decide to stop making the recipe videos though, I do understand. Just know that we all love everyone that made this channel and we will support you in whatever path you choose.
Does chef plan on never having another pet again? I think it would be ok to have another lovely pet. Maybe one day.
finally I realized he's speaking English, not Japanese
フランスさん無しでも、涙目でビデオ見て応援しています！
I love to see your VDO clip , please dont stop na ka.
How do I keep from overcooking Enoki mushrooms?
I lost my dog today.. feeling very sad
y francis 2 videos ya :(
rip francis😞
gosh, I love this show
oh my god OH MY GOD I'm so not stable right now and I come here to calm myself and FRANCIS IS GONE? I cannot believe it...
So sad to see you and Francis go. :-(
I'm so sorry to hear Francis has passed away. He brought so much joy to so many. <3
Francis was a good dog <3
My condolences. Rest in peace Francis. :(
damn internet. this is shocked me. rip Francis 😢😢😢😢
Francis we miss you loads :(
你們會每禮拜六煮料理新影片嗎？
i wonder if this will taste good with chicken breast, i don't really like the flavor of thighs
I'll always have a special place in my heart for Francis.
noooo whyyyy. please don't stop the show
maybe fill in francis' with a cat or other fun animal?
Is the channel going to meet the 10th year anniversary??
Francis doll should stay in his memory and continue the show, while the real francis can never be replaced in our hearts being reminded of his legacy would allow the shop to continue with him in mind!  I'm sorry for Chef and the team's loss, thank you all and francis for your dedicated working bringing Japanese cooking to the attention of foreigners and I hope for your continued hard work and happiness RIP Francis
So good to see you back!
FRANCIS NOOOOOOO
FRANCIS NOOOOOOO
Oh goodness, I haven't been able to watch your videos regularly for a while now and so I've just found out Francis is gone. It's been so many years I have been following you and  as my own dog passed away something over a year ago I still remember how painfull it was! I understand why you don't want to make videos on a regular basis now, it's a good way to honour his memories, I wish you all the best in life and thank you for all the great recipes over the last decade!
<3
omg im so sorry for your loss, mu condolences.
I'm sorry to hear about Francis. It's never easy to say goodbye to one of our fur babies.
ヘルシーそうなので週末に作ろうかな。
take your time and heal, hopefully you will feel differently in time!
Chef san, so sorry about Francis' passing. We all miss him very much but I'm sure he had the most wonderful life.
my heart is broken
We miss you Francis! :(
I totally understand how you feel Chef. I love my dog so much, he's part of my family and irreplaceable. Many people are saying to replace Francis with another dog or a cat, I know it's not as easy as that. I am sure Francis would have loved to continue sitting by you in the kitchen and smelling your delicious recipes. My deepest condolences chef, may time heal your heart.
First Francis passed, and now Gabe too... why are famous dogs we have become attached to passing so quickly?
Omg I'm gonna cry :( this is so sad. Francis doll is there :((((
🐶🐶❤❤ 😭
I have tried chef's recipes in the past and now everytime i cook chef's recipes i'll miss francis. Stay strong chef, you have our support.
Yes, please don't stop making your videos.  Francis will always have a special place in our hearts.  But Chef, we love you too!  Besides.....isn't that what Francis would have wanted you to do?!
omg thats sad 😦😭😿
poor Francis I hope chef is doing OK
Rest in peace,Francis! Please don't stop creating content. Your channel taught me a lot about cooking Japanese cuisine and fusion cuisine . Francis will definitely be missed and remembered but not forgotten.
My sincerest condolences for the passing of Francis.  I know how difficult it is when a beloved pet passes, and while you will have bad days, they will eventually get easier.  RIP Francis, we love you.
😭😭😭😭😭
シェフの笑顔を見れて安心しました。
嬉しいです❤️またたくさんお料理作ってね。
❤❤❤
I love your show and am saddened by your loss of your dear dog Francis.  I love dogs as well.  I look forward to your new addition as your hearts mend.
フランシスくんの、ご冥福をお祈りいたします。
U poor poor woman, Francis was adorable and must have been well trained to sit while u make recipes. We will all miss this amazing dog, and I hope u know that we r all here 4 u 🐕😘🐶😍😍😢😭😢😪😥
I love your videos. For some reasons I stopped watching the show some time... now I am finding out that Francis passed away... how sad. He was a nice and well behaved dog and I think we all are gonna miss him. Goodbye Francis!
Very sad that the passing of Francis will have you stop sharing recipes. I do agree you should not replace him but your videos and recipes are so good, please don't stop.
How about Cooking with Cat?
I'm so sorry about Francis!
久しぶりに見たらフランシスが縫いぐるみになってびっくりした⁉️
那新影片週六會來嗎？
francis will be sorely missed 😢
Great recipe!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
IM SO SAD OH  MY GOD ))p:
You're so cute, Chef!
its 2 in the morning and im crying over a dog
miss francis so much 💜
It's time for cooking with parrot!
this is a bad year for good doggies so far :( rip Francis
I was hit with so many emotions in just a cooking video! There's really something special about these videos and the chef makes everything seem so nice and fun, as well as the narrator. Very nice working crew. I wish you luck in the future! Love the videos. -
I will watch your videos until the end of the century saviour arrives
Thank you Francis, and Chef. I am always glad for the videos you made for us. Whatever you choose to do now... good luck in the kitchen.
the spirit of francis will live on!
Awwww Francis! R.I.P
<\3
Rest easy Francis ♥️:'(
Thank you so much for the years of recipes! This has been the home of my Japanese culinary learning, and I wish you the best in whatever path you decide to go with. May Francis rest in peace <3
I should make this for me and my friend! she loves it when I cook!
なんかまた泣きそう…
:'( devastated
Goodbye my sweet chef. You taught me alot. You live on within us and the internet.
Lovely! <3
Francis... We will miss you
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
oh no! that's an era coming to end :-( good luck in the kitchen still for you and all the best wishes! thank you for your kind videos, they were most welcome in my sad dorm room times! hugs and kisses!
Chef and Francis, thank you for all the help you have given me with my cooking, as well as entertainment and simple joy. <3 <3 <3 I am not sure I completely and properly understand the message you prepared for us fans at the end of this video: Did it mean that you plan to occasionally have new videos with seasonal recipes for us, or will the "occasional seasonal recipes" be presented in a non-video format? Love to you all! Thanks for all your hard work! (P.S. Thanks for sharing the Ice Cream at the track with Chef and Francis; He is SO cuuute in it! Great to see you enjoying family time!)
We will miss you :((
the stuffed francis is making me sad...
Rest well Francis.
My sincere condolences, Francis will be missed.
RIP Frances. Please keep making videos for Frances.
Rip francis :(
🐷
Francis  :(
I'm very sorry to hear that Francis has passed. It's great that you have so many videos to remember your faithful friend.
Francis will be missed.  Chef-san, 心からお悔やみ申し上げます (kokorokara okuyamimōshiagemasu).
I am so sorry to hear the bad news about Francis :(
We will miss you Francis...
Could you use any alternative to saki in the sauce (its kinda hard to buy where I live :P) thanks :)
you could just change the title to cooking with ghost dog.
I can understand you don't want to replace Francis by an other dog, but you can use the Francis's plush. So please continue to make videos !!!! I love your recipes !!
RIP doggo :'(
Francis will always stay in ours heart.
R.I.P Francis
Only those who deeply loves his dog can understand your choice. I respect you a lot and I will continue to follow you with love.
Hope Francis is in Japanese dog heaven. And the other dog is just as good < :
Please don't stop making videos, we all gonna miss Francis a lot :(
Aww Francis died? That's so sad.... I haven't watched the videos in awhile so I didn't know... Francis was a good boy :( He will be missed...
I would like to express my condolence, feeling so sad to know Francis has gone, I really love this show especially Francis, I believe there is a meaningful bond between Francis and chef team, thank you for sharing us the warmness of this show, no matter what will be in the future about this show, Francis will always remain in our heart.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😓
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We fans will support you guys in whatever you decide to do in the future.
フランシス亡くなったんですか。。知らなかった...(ŏ﹏ŏ。)
i am so sorry to hear about Francis. my condolences
I'm sorry for your loss. Francis has shared so much with all of us. Thank you for all you do.
Might be too soon but...... Maybe ya should get another poodle?
I don't know why Francis lost!!! So miss you
Sorry about Francis, but you need to keep producing more videos. I have learned a lot from you. Greetings from Chile.
😢
RIP Francis
RIP Francis
So nice to see another video in this channel. Ganbatte!
RIP Francis
RIP Francis
Rest in delicious spaghetti, never forgetti.
Goodbye Francis.  You taught me how to make curry udon, which has become one of my absolute favorite udon dishes.

And, to our human friends, I'm sorry he passed.  I hope the show will continue when ever you are ready in whatever way is appropriate because I love your channel.  Either way, I'm thankful for your informational recipes.  I promise to try this one in the near future because it looks delicious.
Dont stop chefffffffff
Chef is always so cute

I just cried 😢
I'm still hopeful chef will make more videos..
We love you chef!
francis need a successor :(
I  miss Francis and so sorry for your loss. Please don't stop making videos, your recipes are delicious.
Thank you Francis and Chef for providing us so many wonderful years of great videos and delicious recipes! I wish you success in whatever you wish to do next. We will miss you, and hope you come back soon!
We love you Chef! we're here to support you!
I wouldn't want to see the videos stop. I understand not getting a new dog but videos with the Francis plush I feel are a perfect way to continue, but to also not replace him so it's always his show.
Very sad day :( I'll miss the show!
I understand you aren't ready to have another dog yet. Personal I'd love it if you kept making videos in memory of Francis. RIP Francis.
I think this channel needs a new host
I miss Francis 😔 he is very loved
😢😢😢😢😢😢
I miss Francis 😭😭😭😭
Chef, please cheer up. I heard if you keep thinking about your loved one who or which passed away, then the one is still around you. Francis would be the same. I, as a big fan of this show, express my condolences deeply.
hi chef.  hope you are doing well.
rip francis
i am so sorry for your loss :(
Thank you for the years of fun and good luck in the kitchen. XXOO
Francis was such a wonderful dog and will always wills be. Francis shall always be in our hearts. Rest In Peace Francis.
RIP Francis. Show will never be the same
sad to see the show go.. but I'll still enjoy the old videos as long as there here 😘😊
Please continue to make videos! Just keep the cute plush Francis there!
DOG to the GOD🐩😇
I miss Francis, it hurts
tht is so sad ;c
get a cat, a toy, introduce the narrator... but please don't stop making the videos :(
Really sad to learn that you will no longer make regular videos.  I just wanted to say thank you for maintaining such a wonderful channel all these years.  It was a joy to learn a little bit more about japanese dishes and cooking methods from your channel.  Best of luck to Chef and Narrator!
Francis will be missed. Very sad to hear that he's passed away.
Am I here to learn how to cook or to cry😭 Please don't stop making videos we all love your channel
francis was a good dog 😢, oh
WTH ?!?!?! FRANCIS???
I'm super sad that Francis is gone, I cried when I found he passed away. My condolences. But nothing would make my heart sing louder than seeing a little puppy over there while you cook. Obviously he wouldn't replace Francis, but he would be the next legacy. Francis would be proud. :)
I started watching this channel when I was 12 years old, and I always thought, "I like that dog, he looks really nice" and now I'm with 16 years old, and I will always remember Francis, the best dog in a kitchen, and will miss too much, my condolences, love your videos and recipes
I don't know whether you all notice? .... but chef is getting old.. I used to watch the old video when she was young.. and now she is getting older.. I hope chef is healthy as always and don't stop the passion on cooking. I really love Japanese food and of course your's recipes <3
Sorry to hear about Francis 😭
フランシス死んじゃったんだ(><)

Do you think about new Francis? New puppy?
Francis will be missed :(
umasou !
Francis :(
Francis you have a fan i mexico
I look: I am following you since 6 years and i have seen all your videos at least once, and tried more than 40 recipes, and there is at least 10 that i am making often! I wanted to taste real japan food! Thank to you, I was able to before coming to Japan. I came last Summer at Nagoya for the  World Cosplay Summit 2016, I visit after Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo. I find relief of "tasting" dishes I already made. I was happy it almost tastes the same! You made a realy amazing channel. 

I feel like you could keep Francis Spirit alive by keeping the cute plushy ^^ this way, he'll be always there! He could be a host and invite other dogs as assistant, but he'll always be the main dog of the show! ^^ i Realy love the adventure of plushy françis in japan showing stores ^^  

Thank you for all this work !
owh so sad... poor francis.. we going to miss him
nooooo don't stop making videos
I am so sad now
senbei rice snack please
I know Im late on this but... RIP Francis, I'm going to miss seeing him in the videos. He was such a great and beautiful dog and he will be missed 😟
Dear Francis, I just heard of your leaving. But no matter where you were going, you are always the star in the show, you are always there that I can feel!  Love you so very much!
Play forever in doggy heaven Francis!  And you guys should definitely not stop making new videos.  I'm sure Francis be happy if you continued!
I am so sorry. Rest in peace, Francis!
Francis :'(
I  miss Francis :'(
Oh my God I didn't know that Francis passed away!!! I am extremely sad I want to cry!!! TOT
Francis...
Please don't stop making video. Honestly first came in Japan (as wife) I couldnt cook anything. But I started searching on youtube many cooking videos, but only your videos are easy for me to understand how to cook japanese foods. All of my family member like my Japanese food cooking because I always try your recipes. Please continue making videos🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️🙇🏻‍♀️
Rest in peace Francis!
フランシスくん天国に行ってしまったんですね…
とても寂しいです。
料理いつも参考にしています
がんばってください。
Rest in peace pupper
Thank you Chef, for your wonderful videos. No one could or should replace Francis. He was a one in a million dog. We will all look forward to your future videos, no matter how long we have to wait. Please, take all the time you need, we love you very much!
😢
Francis will be dearly missed, but cherished in life. I have been subscribed for many years, I basically grew up with Francis from a distance, so it is very saddening to hear he passed in recent months. May he rest in peace. I will continue to watch and I hope Chef lives a long and healthy life herself! Lots of hugs and support to you. It won't be the same without Chef and Francis together like old times, but all good things must come to an end. But with the closing of one chapter, a new one begins! May this new chapter be long and fulfilling for Miss Chef!
👍
omg he died i am gonna cry now ;(
Since Francis died the channel is still called Cooking with Dog. Suspicious to say the least... What is that meat we just saw?
R. I. P. Francis.
Loooovveee your videeooss
I fee so bad...
I was actually think about Francis earlier and this channel and now I know that Francis died makes me really sad I'm sorry for your loss.
Rip
😭😭😭😭😭😭
We love you, Chef!
i can only feel a deep, clawing sadness
RIP  Francis Q口Q
Francis... ;(
I miss you...
I'm so sorry to hear about Francis passing away. I know you all loved him very much, he was such a cute sweet little dog :( I hope you all keep making videos. I know how hard it is to lose a pet you love :(
I like your cooking.  Will you become a foster parent for a dog that is likely to be killed?

さっしょぶん されそうないぬ たち、さとおやに なってくれませんか？
Oh no, I'm sorry for your loss :( I hope after you have taken some time this wont let stop you from making videos. I love watching them so much!
Oh crap, I haven't been on this channel for some long and didn't know Francis passed away, my condolences
Awww RIP Francis :( my dog looks just like him, but a much bigger version.
I'm so sad to find this youtube channel right now... especially finding out Francis just passed :(
I'm wondering about the guy who always tells the process of cooking meals in cooking with dog. Anyone know him?
gosh Francis died on my birthday....
さびしい
My love and sympathy to the passing of Francis
Are you going to get another dog??
RIP Francis:'(
I want to try real Japanese food
Francis ...  :c
お気の毒に、Chef-さん！
フランシスがいなくてとても寂しいですがいつも私たちの心にすんでいます。きっと。

いろいろ教えてくれてありがとう！本当にありがとうございました！

お疲れさまでした！
Francis is here in our hearts, the show, and when our pups or kitties come into the kitchen while we are cooking he is there too. Just cause his body is gone dosnt mean his spirit is. Chef he loves you and narrator he loves you as well.
それはおいしそうに見える
WHY THE HEY ARE SO MANY DOGS DYING
:( oh no i miss the dog....
I totally love sukiyaki  have since a small child
Let Chef runs the show, and tell us her name!
Time to give another dog a wonderful home with wonderful people, when your ready.
yum
I feel like I just want to chant your names to root for you guys, like a cheerleader, but like through the screen. Go Chef! Go Francis! *sobs
So sorry for your loss of Francis....
フランシスどうしたの？
where the dog????😢
I understand,it took quite a time to cope with the death of beloved Francis..but please don't stop the show!.I really don't care to wait for how long for the new videos as long as I can still viewed the previous one from subscribed channels!.It is okay for me to see only the cute Francis plushie,it is still Francis,right?.
That's so sad!
Please don't stop making videos :(( supporting your videos until the end :)
ㄲㄴ곡니기케걱ㄷㄴ
Nope, still not over it.
I'm sorry for Francis, I hope you are fine, I would like to continue to enjoy new videos in the future.
Oh my god.. I know that Francis getting old and will die soon..I cant stand watching Francis just sitting there and barely move, i cry so much... i've been avoiding your channel since last year because of him. today hear this story make me realise time moving so fast. good job francis..u know u doing good.
So sad
what happened to francis D:
RIP
At least ,you're back ! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
He's passed?? When did this happen???? 😭😭
どうもありがとうございました。 おいしい
I'm glad to see Cooking With Dog continue. I'm happy to see Chef's smile again and new recipes to try! Please keep doing your best!

Cooking With Dogを続けるよかったね！もうChefさんの笑顔をみる嬉しくなって、新しい作り方食べ物が料理するも嬉しくなる。ChefさんもFrancisくんも頑張ってください！
Please follow what you believe you must do. I've been a fan since the beginning, and seeing Francis not there is heartbreaking. If you don't feel right continuing with the CWD title, it's fine. I thank you all for your work in introducing me, alongside many others, to another country's cuisine in as warm an environment as possible on the internet.
We like your recipes chef and narrator voice and we miss Francis too. Please continue to make videos with the little Francis toy dog, it makes me feel like he is still with us.
I'm sorry about Francis  😢
Awwwwwwwwwwwwww sorry for your loss :(
So the next vid will have the title cooking without the dog?
the dog passed away?
:'(
Yummy yummy
except new videos next time
great video! will miss Francis

I'm so sorry for your loss of Francis.
@Cooking with Dog: All dogs go to heaven. Francis was a good dog. Maybe adopt a parrot (a smart one like an African Grey?) Take care! :D
😢😢😢 I didn't know 🙏🙏🙏🐩🐩🐩
When you've had enough time to mourn and you are ready, Im sure even the viewers would accept a new dog as part of this channel. With or without a dog, we still enjoy the channel.
i will miss Francis so much, Chef's relationship with her dog reminded me of my mom and her dog Rufus. He passed away last year as well and she is still sad about it. Someone once told me that when a pet dies, they take a piece of your heart that you can never get back - which sounds bad, but it means you will never really forget them. I know I will love watching older videos with Francis and hope that Chef and the Cooking With Dog team keeps making videos!
Dont stop! x0
wow when she turned to the cuddly Francis and then to the window and said "Francis-kun, onegaishimasu~" as if he was there... That's partly why I dont have any pets.  I would cry my eyes out when they pass away.
I am so sad Francis died!!! :( Thank you for all the amazing cooking lessons. おつかれさまでした。 おせわになりました。
chef needs to get a new puppy
rip francis please don't stop making videos just get a cat and make a new channel cooking with cat that way Francis memories will never be forgotten!
Dear Chef, it's okay if you wanna quit after Francis left. I know how it felt too. I'm so grateful I grew up knowing your channel. Thank you, Chef. Have a great life ahead, stay healthy and be happy. I'll be always  cheering up for you. And as always, 🐩 Good luck in the kitchen! 😊
I know I'm late on the subject, but sorry for your loss, its always tough to lose a close friend, a family member or anyone else close, i'm sorry i don't know anything else i can say... except thank you to cooking with dog for posting such great recipe videos
I am so sorry to read that Francis has passed away. Such a sweet doggie she was...
Francis te queremos. Gracias por estos últimos 10 años. Te echaremos de menos :'(
Do you guys consider adopt/find new dogs? maybe not the same as francis :)
Francis NNNNNNNOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
in 30 years every celebrity that you know will be dead replaced by new celebrities.
!!!
So sorry for your loss. I do hope you continue to make videos - watching Chef cook makes me happy and the food always looks delicious!
u can hear in her voice that she's holding back the tears.
Can I skip Sake?
So sad :((((
im new to this chanel and knowing the dog is dead, depress me a little
As a long time viewer...and a fan of Francis, I am going to suggest that Francis would want the show to go on. There is no need for another dog, unless you want one. Your recipes and videos can stand on their own. I think Francis would be honored to know that you continued on after his passing. I just lost my 21-year old cat and know the pain that the passing of our pets bring us...but, I think that they would want us to continue our lives and be as happy as they remember us. No matter what you decide, your fans will support your decision.
こんにちは良い午後
 多分私達は、私たちが行うことができない人にはわからないが、これは、あなたもペットやの損失が私たちに子供のようになってきていることであり、彼らは私たちを愛しためのメッセージです。それは、別れは非常に困難であり、あなたが何も同じではないことを感じることですが、私はあなたを求めるあなたは、私が今アメリカで調理勉強しています、これは私の人生のためにescoji方法であり、私が発見してもみなかったすべてのこれらの年をやった終了しませんしてくださいそれは私がユーチューブで見た最初のビデオのためではなかった場合、私はちょうど継続再考をお願いして調理し、この方法を学び保つためにあなたがされているビデオケーキcristmas食品多くのインスピレーションを愛をして調理するのが大好きプログラムと私はあなたが読ん場合でも、日本の希望を話すことができないが、これは奇妙な何か私はあなたを与えるしたいメッセージを理解して音

Oh my god I just felt like I got hit by a bus...I've been a follower since like 100,000 followers...I feel so bad..I lost my two dogs this year as well...please keep making videos in honor of Francis..but I'm so sorry for your lost...😢😢💔

I'm very sorry for your loss., but don't stop  making new videos, please.
my day just got ruined. francis died.
awww sorry for loosing Francis .. :-( deepest sympathy im going to miss Francis
I'm not sure if it would be safe to eat raw American eggs.
Francis died?!?! D:
So Francis was a girl or boy? Name is boyish, but he looked like a girl.
这是什么都不   能给她    4一年来试试??。。一??:)
I made this and it was so delicious and easy!!!
When did Francis die? :/
When did Francis die!?
Tại sao tập này là tập cuối!!!Cầu xin chương trình đừng dừng lại chúng tôi rất yêu quý chương trình và Francis!!Công thức của các bạn chúng toi rất ngưỡng mộ.Bất cứ khi nào các bạn ra Video mới tôi rất rất rất là VUI MỪNG!!!!!!Đây là lời cầu xin không chỉ riêng tôi mà của toàn thể các Fan ở đây!!!Mong chương trình hiểu!!!
u_u
😭😭😭😭😤😤😤😓😓😓FRANCIS!!!
Which was the dog's last video?
I'm sorry.
what the hell did it happen to the dog? Did he die?
What can I substitute it with? Would it make a difference if I didn't use sake?
My dog of 15 years died recently, it was a painful time and I share in your loss. Take care and big hugs. I love your cooking program, and of course your dear Francis.
😢😢😢🙇✨✨✨🌹🌹🐩🐩🌹🌹✨✨✨
Francis died?!?!?! NOOOOOOOO
I just feel so sad that they are going to stop making videos and for their loss. I know it sounds mean but maybe it would be good to get another dog. It might help the healing process. When my dog passed, I waited a little while, went to a shelter and got a new cutie. I really don't want to sound insensitive and sound like I think dogs are objects, because I don't, but it really did help me. I will never forget my past dog Jenny, but I really love my current dog Daisy. Stay strong Chef, we're all supporting you. ♥️
How did Francis die??????
This channel always uses ingredients ive never heard of or seen. Its extremely annoying
I still love your videos chef <3, but what about Francis II? I miss real dog. :'(
Please don't stop making these videos. I have been watching them since I was in highschool (over eight years!) and while I am sad about Francis' passing I don't think Chef Francis would want us to stop learning about Japanese recipes or cooking. 

チャネルが好きです。お疲れ様です。
where is francis
what D: when did francis died? :(
where is Francis? > :
I deeply miss the real Francis, but plush Francis isn't that bad in the sense of the cooking shows. I really enjoy them so please don't cancel them!
I say you rename the show and keep making recipes. We love watching you cook and if you feel uncomfortable replacing Francis, then don't even think about it. We loved Francis, but we love watching you cook just as much!
Please don't stop making videos! You are an inspiration and I started cooking Japanese dishes at home because of you and Francis. Thank you :)
It is never bad getting another dog, and it is never meant to replace a family member. Dogs have short lives and the best thing to do after a dog dies is to get another one because it is worse than not getting one ,it makes you very sad -missing the fun and joyful moments of having a dog in your life. Grandfather dies and the daughter wants to have children -is having children means you are replacing a family member? No! You can never run out of space for family. 

RIP Francis 
kinda sad talking to a stuffed animal and calling it francis.....why not get another dog?i mean its cooking with dog so any dog can do.I meant no offense and i love this show and francis
oh lawd this raw egg combo at the end is terrifying to me, the food looks great though, love your videos
So sad to see that you won't be publishing regular videos, but I understand. Take care.
then continue the show as ur doing it now.. this episode was perfect that clip that was shown at the beginning and that familiar voice and the cute stuff animal would be just fine....I actually have tried 10 of ur recipes all with great results and response from my family..... plz don't stop and plz don't think you have to replace Francis.... that would be impossible to do.. I hope one of u reads this. please continue
:'( please no just get a puppy
44 Trump voters disliked this video. wow. RIP Francis 🍝🐩
please dont stop making videos, i know you cannot replace francis, i would love to see a continuation in his memory using  either the stuffed francis in his place  to represent his spirit or something like that... i love your videos!
;-; that's mondo depressing about Francis' passing...but stopping the show is just as sad to hear... ;-; everyone loves the show, and hopefully one day there might be a Francis Jr. for the show...
I do hope it's going to be more than a recipe once in a while. Much as appreciated and fancied Francis, I visit this channel to learn Japanese cooking.  Please continue.
Where is that lovely dog?
Continue making ur videos u have a bunch of stuffed dogs that you could use anyways
@Cooking with Dog I watch the videos from time to time. Sad to hear that Francis passed. I know its hard and I agree with everyone else keep going on I'd hate for this wonderful channel to stop...and maybe in due time there may come a time for a Francis the II
Cooking with dog and there is no dog...this is a scam or what?
Hi Chef, think about using an animated dog like the cartoon francis you already use. Although Francis was key to the show what we really enjoy is your cooking and it would be a big loss if you stop making videos.
She finally cook the dog
Where is the real Frances. I want the real Frances.
Francis is gone?! Oh my...I didn't expect this. 2016 is taking away so many wonderful people, and now one of the best dogs. I'm so sorry for your loss. Rest in peace.
This is the saddest I've ever been watching a video about pastries.
Very sad about Francis :( Pass on my best to Chef
2016 wants to kill everything we love and embrace everything we hate.
The tart is beautiful, and it looks so delicious.  Thank you so much for the video, Chef.  Sending best wishes to you and your family at the New Year!
I honestly want to cry when I see the plush Francis. It is so sad this kind creature passed away :( I have followed this channel for 7 or 8 years now. Even when turning vegan I kept watching the video's. I just loved Chef and Francis. I hope all is well with you Chef. Francis will be missed
I miss Francis. Be strong and keep sharing cooking lessons.
Francis was so sweet, we will really miss him.  I hope Chef is doing okay.  <3
:( i can't believe it... Francis... :((( I will miss you so much :(
Francis, David Bowie, Prince, and Carrie Fisher?!?! What the hell 2016!
Sorry to hear of the loss of Francis,  who was a wonderful host and I'm sure a beloved family member.
So will the show continue without Francis?? I miss Francis tho, but I don't want this to end :(
Is there a possibility you might make a 'favorite moments with Francis' type video? A compilation of times Francis has done silly things or reacted to something in the kitchen?
My heart hurts. But the recipe looks good. :)
Looks delicious. And I'm so sorry for your loss.
Will you guys keep making tutorials? I miss Francis, but I love your videos!
I miss him. I hope you all stay strong.
R.I.P Francis :(
Hope Francis is living in paradise and be happy forever！
Francis's Mama, take care and keep it up! Happy new year!
I've used almond flour to make marzipan. This is another nice way to use it. I was very bummed out to hear that Francis had died.
Cooking with Dog crew, you should continue to use the Francis plushies, and at the beginning of the episode, say, "Hi, I'm Francis, the gHost of this show, Cooking with Dog," in playful homage to Francis. <3
It never ceases to amaze me how beautiful all this culinary creations are…
This looks delicious! Best wishes to you Chef and you family for the New Year. I'm sure Francis is watching from above and wants you to be happy and continue to share your beautiful gift of food with everyone.
ooo...the Tart looks SO yummy! Thank you so much for the video, Chef! ^O^  and happy new years to you and your Family
seeing the stuff francis dog is breaking my heart. I miss francis :( rest in peace.

Just when I was calculating how long Cooking With Dog has been airing and how old Francis would have been out of curiosity, I see this.. My heart hurts. 😭
I just found out about Francis from the Udon noodle video... Rest in peace Francis, I hope you are doing okay Chef.
You are my favourite cooking channel (and the only one I actually enjoy watching.)💙💜💙💜💙💜💙💜
Chef! I'm sending lots of love your way! Your recipes are amazing and easy to follow. I hope we'll all see you again soon.
Rip Francis was a great inspiration for everyone <3

Thank you for your great recipe. I made the apple tart this morning and it was delicious. 👍🏻
Rest in peace, Francis. My gratitude to the chef, the narrator and all the people working for this show.
Good video. I hope in 2017 the channel renovates videos, with another dog (sad, but true), new recipes and ... keep going. The show must go on. (Francis would love it :)  )
I'm crying at the stuffed Francis 😭😭 !!!
Francis will be dearly missed. Bet he is now playing happily around that rainbow bridge. Thank you for sharing Francis and your great cooking recipes. My thoughts are with you, Chef.

Thank you Chef and Francis for teaching us many recipes over the years. Francis will be missed, RIP ❤
Looks fantastic...I don't bake much but I definitely want to try this one.
Thanks chef!
Red or green apples? I'm guessing it all depends on what you like.. "sour" or sweet
I'd like to made this, but was curious if I can substitute the metal tart pan with a glass pie pan?

My deepest condolences to chef and director about Francis. Losing a friend is never an easy thing.
🍎タルト・・・フランシスも見てるかな('ω')

I guess I  am just an over-emotional American, but I have to say that I admire you for carrying on your work. Francis is always proud of his Mama! 😉 I lost my wonderful Cocker Spaniel,  Peanut, earlier this year, so I feel that we share an understanding.  Also, the recipe looks delicious!

Francis will always be in our hearts keep cooking and be strong 💜❤💜
Oh nooo Francis ;_;
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Even though Francis is gone, I am indeed glad chef is still making these videos. RIP Francis 🐕
Francis the dog, we will miss you!! thank you for all the good cooking memories, you will always be in our hearts!
Chef, please upload more cooking video although Francis already passed away. I know Francis made the videos really amazing. But, actually I liked almost all videos because the menu is beautiful, the way Chef talks, and the way narrator talks.
Francis was such a good pup, such a sweet face so calm. I sometimes watch these videos when I'm sad and they bring a smile to my face without fail.
I'm so sorry for Francis, you guys introduced me to Japanese cuisine. I really like your work. I hope Chef are well and hope that she come back stronger than ever to keep alive the memory of Francis. Chef you have all my support and my love <3
Every video I watch, the more impressed I am with your level of skill, Chef.
love you and Francis forever♡

I know Francis is gone and I will miss him but I hope you continue to make videos.  I really love this channel!
NO !!!!  Francis :'( que triste... si por él llegué a este canal. Me entristece :'(
FRANCIS PASSED AWAY?! OMG NO.
I don't like dogs but he was so sweet just sitting there always! D:
I'm sure Francis was happy being next to the chef at every video. I hope you keep cooking.

I have a request, any way you can create the foods that was made off the anime Food Wars? like Gotcha Pork Roast and Chaliapin Steak Don? 

thank you, and may Francis rest in peace with full of happiness
you should replace Francis with a Norwegian blue
Best wishes for the new year, chef. I hope you continue to bring us new recipes.
nooooooooooo :( :(
Thank you for your wonderful recipes. I'm so very sorry to hear about Francis. :*( My thoughts are with you.
gnammy!!!
I am so glad to see that you are going on even after losing Francis! Keep up the good work, Chef! 私はあなたがFrancisを失った後でさえも続いているのを見てとてもうれしいです！ シェフ、良い仕事を続けてください！
damn you 2016 took Francis too :(
フランシスゥゥゥ!(´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)(´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
I've been following this channel for around three years now, all of which were pretty hectic with a bunch of change and stuff going on. Every once in a while I'd pop back in on this channel and check out the newer vids, which really helped me to de-stress and eventually to discover that I like the arts a lot. I feel like this channel has become a part of me in a small way, to hear that he passed hurts. Sorry for your loss, I could tell you really loved Francis.
Waaahh.. Francis is gone? RIP Francis!  :'(
I can't believe Francis passed away, he was always so cute and well-behaved, even when the host was cooking meat :( RIP
Francis was loved by so many of us. And loved by his family so much. Rest in peace, Francis. From the bottom of my heart, my condolences to chef and their family.
Francis always brighten up my days when I was feeling a little down. always looked forward to seeing him and the chef cook. Rip Francis
Chef, thank you.
for all your videos and special days with Francis.
I will always Watch Cooking with Dog ♡♡♡
Glad to see you back hun! We do miss Francis so.
I'll support this channel forever (and get great recipes while doing so!)
I'm so glad you're continuing these videos. I miss Francis, but these videos keep his spirit with us. Will there be any more "Go! Francis" videos?
What would a good substitute for the almond powder be? I'm allergic to most nuts, but this recipe looks really good and it'd be a shame to make something I couldn't eat.

I can't remember if I've said this before, so... Thank you for all the recipes you've shared.
First Harambe now Francis R.I.P Francis we will miss you💔
I screamed when I saw that Francis died. I feel so sorry for you. May he Rest In Peace. <3
Sending you all my love Chef! ♡♡Also the Apple Tart looks soo good!♡♡
is francis dead for real?
◔◔
☼ ..thank you
waaaaaah I don't even like apples but that looks sooooo delicioussssss!!!! omg that texture looks just perfect **
Francis would have wanted it this way, he would have wanted you to move on. Bless up.
Seriously cried when I heard about Francis ....
Francis is an angel now (*ﾟ∀ﾟ)
Thanks for another amazing recipe, chef. I guess you must have been spending difficult times after Francis's gone. Please look after yourself well and come back soon with more videos. Missing you so much.
Rest in Peace Francis, you and Chef made a lot of good recipes and I'm eternally thankful to both of you for really giving me the love of cooking.
This breaks my heart.

I'm so grateful that Chief continues to make videos <3
Awww how sad.... I hope you Rest In Peace Francis.... 😔💐
hope chef is doing alright! All the best
Francis was such a good dog, and an even better host, we will miss him so much. <3
So many people saying "Francis passed away what?!" when they mentioned it in the last couple of videos already. He passed away Nov 6th, where have y'all been?
Please don't cloud the comment section with sadness, Chef has it hard enough already 😖
Looks so good, can't wait to try it!
oishiiii soooo 😋
I am so sorry for your loss, please keep with us we love you!
My heart was broken to hear that Francis was sick and then died. Losing such a lovely and even-tempered companion must be so difficult. I hope eventually you continue doing these videos - they really make my Fridays when they released and  watching Chef cook & expertly prepare delicious food makes me so happy!
This channel has becoming a depressing one with Francis passed away.
I wonder how are they gonna continue when the pre recorded videos are done.
Good-bye Francis, as a host you will be greatly miss. Condolences to your friends and Chef.

Ooooh, noooo! Francis has left us? I am so sorry to hear that. RIP Francis. Hope you are well.

My mom and I used to watch Cooking with Dog together, and her favorite part of the video was always watching Chef laugh and smile. My mom would say that chef's laugh was contagious.
Oh.so sad to know that. RIP Francis

Hello Chef, my boyfriend and I are a big of yours. We've watched a lot of videos and tried some of your recipes. We are truly sad about Francis's passing and my boyfriend felt bad about it. He was diagnosed recently with depression but he is slowly getting by. I wish you well Chef and your team. All the love from the Philippines.
I'm very sorry for Francis, i hope you haven't suffered too much, he looked sweet besides being cute.A big hug. <3
;-;
Everytime I see Francis I feel overwhelmed by the tears, I miss him terribly

I used this method on a filo dough bake, switching almond flour for minced walnuts (and reduced apple cider for compote). It came out as a lovely and light delicious dessert. My family was quite happy with the results!
Wait... what! Francis passed away? Then what happens to all the other recipes without Francis!? I only just knew this now :( I hope everything will be alright though
😭😭😭 we miss Francis 💔🐶❤️
Rip :(
動画のアップロードありがとうございます。美味しそうです！良いお年をお迎えください。来年も応援しています。

Thank you for uploading a new video. Looks awesome! 

Wish you all the best and happy new year - will keep watching your video :)
I'm so sorry for your lost. Rest In Peace Francis.
Looks delicious thank you !
I just made it ! My whole family loves it, even though my apples sank to the bottom because I put too much almond cream haha. Thank you for this delicious recipe!
Aww Francis 😢
Is it possible to skip the cream part and add more of the compote? I'm not fond of the cream/custard part personally.
This is just sad. Gabe is dead, now Francis is gone. 😢 RIP, Francis will always be the best companion the woman has ever had. RIP, Gabe, I will always keep listening to your music, you were and will always be my favorite singer. 🙏(they should add a girl praying) everyone, let's pray for these amazing dogs that God has sent to us and their owners.🙏
Francis te extrañamos😢😢😢
We'll miss you, Francis. You won't ever know how many people you made smile in your lifetime. We love you.

thank you Chef & Francis for teaching me how to make very delicious food for my family!! I recently tried making chiffon cake & souffle cheesecake and they turned out great and my mom loved them. sending you best wishes as well and happy holidays and new year (soon). may Francis rest in peace.
Beautiful and delicious looking tart! If Francis were here he'd be whimpering for a piece, I'm sure :)

WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR FAVORITE DOG?!?!?!
No :'( I cant
condolences.
I feel like Chinese five spice, Anise, Allspice and cloves would also go good with the cinnamon.
If only they invented smellovision for computers already. I bet that smells heavenly.
I miss Francis ): I remember watching Cooking with Dog for the first time six years ago and thinking about how cute he was! Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipes and personality with us, Chef. Francis was a good friend and will be missed. I wish you a healthy and happy New Year.

we will miss francis a lot <3 i hope that our support reaches chef and wish her a happy new year =)
I was watching the video but pausing 11 times and ended the whole thing for 47 minutes.....I cried watching the Chef doing things as usual with little smile on her face....(I died )
I can relate my self to her because I also lost my loving pet 2 years ago and still struggling to overcome the sadness. My husband told me to move on and give my self a chance to get another lovable pet to love and care. Recently I'm starting to accept things more in possitive way and I hope we can get our new family pet very soon.      We will miss you Francis.     今はさすかに辛い時期だと思いますけど...私も含めて暖かいみなさんから愛と応援を届きます！頑張って下さい！
Miss Francis so much, his presence along with Chef cooking really created beautiful, heart-warming videos for the viewers. On a happy note, this tart looks really good! =)
😭. 😔 😭
Poor Francis. I'm so sorry :(
My condolences for the loss of Frances.  The dog in my picture passed away two years ago.  It was a big loss.  I have since adopted two dogs that are my best friends.  When the time is right, you should get another poodle and call him the souix chef :)
Wait! what!? Francis is gone, i just left for a months on this channel and now francis gone, I'm so sorry for your loss, R.I.P Francis, i love you, you are my favourite dog of all time, i just left for a months because i go to my grandpa and grandma's house, i stay there like 2 months and then when i came back, i was so shock that francis passed away :( we love you francis, you'll be always in our heart
RIP Francis
Francis 😞
I'm sorry to hear that Francis passed away...RIP little guy.

RIP Francis..... :(
.. I come back to see my favorite cooking dog and come to find out he's dead?!Francis will live on in my heart I hope he had a great life
Your Apple Tart looks absolutely delicious! Thank you for all your work on your cooking videos thru the years.  Sorry for your loss. Francis always brought a smile to my face. And I won't forget the first time I found your channel on Youtube. 2016 has brought change to many of us. But I hope you continue to pursue your passions for cooking on Youtube.  You taught me a lot and introduced me to a lot of new flavors and culinary ideas. And for that I thank you. – Lathan
RIP Francis , je me suis vraiment attaché à lui et à cette madame ! Je suis en deuil ! Merci pour tout !
This is so sad....
thank you for this video. I will continue too support you in the future regardless if you find a new dog or if you continue without a dog. I love you guys' videos and their quality. I tried so many Japanese dishes for the first time following your recipes. thank you
my condolences to you chef!
How many episodes are in the backlog exactly just before Francis passed on? I'm quite curious...
So sorry to learn that Francis passed away. 😞
im so sorry
Please don't stop making videos!!!

The colors in this tart are too pretty. Though it sounds better with pears.
looks delicious!
I'm ready to try this tart on my own
I really miss Francis.... he was well behaved when she was cooking... You were with Francis for 9 years! So amazing! But sadly, this is the last year... R.I.P Francis

Hope you buy another dog soon!
Nobody... Told me that Francis died.   😤  Now I'm crying inside like the female dog I am.  🤧

Just want to make sure that the tart crust is prebaked? I could not find the instruction in the video but the tart crust used in the video looked prebaked. I want to double check on this because 40-50 minutes of baking time seems quite long and I am afraid the crust edges might get burned if prebaking is not required and I mistakenly prebake the crust. Thank you.
R.I.P.Francis
Oh Francis
Francis where are you?
今回のフランシス君は何か違うね
rest in peace francis
WHAT NOOOOOOOOOOO FRANCISSSSSSSSDSD NOO
please get a Francis part 2
i miss francis so much
miss francis!
Aunque ya no está Francis pero cada vez te veo estoy muy feliz, me pone la sonrisa y siento como si Francis estuviera siempre con nosotros.
RIP doggo. What is going to happen to the channel now? Cooking without Dog? Cooking with Different Dog? Cooking with Cat?
Goodbye Francis...
sorry about Francis
I miss Francis too.
Francis was so cute to pass away😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Maybe you can get a new host?
my condolences for your loss
Yummy!
u should change ur channel name to cooking with grandma because ur dog is dead
Hi Chef! I just wanted to know, what other kinds of tarts could I make with this method? I'm allergic to apples and quite a few other fruits, so I was wondering how you would caramelize other fruits and maybe some berries and what would go good with what.
Omg!! So sad!! RIP Francis. Will Francis be replace?
2代目のフランシスとは？
sorry for your loss
フランシスがいなくて。。動画を見てるだけの私でもさみしくなります。きっとシェフさんの悲しみは想像以上かと思います。。(何かいい言葉を…。と思ったけれど思い浮かばず。。) 私はシェフさんの穏やかな笑顔に何度も癒されました。ありがとう。また新しい動画を楽しみにしています。。＾＾
wow yummy
What you call an "almond cream" appears to be what we'd call a "frangipane". Never heard of the term "almond cream" before. I mean, it hasn't any cream in it, after all!
I'm sorry....  :(
what a wonderful video
can we please not make this any harder we alll know were going to miss francis forever 😕 but can we not bring this up again and again for chefs sake 😕lets all be positive francis is n the good place ...anwy our love for this channel and community will be eternal ! :***
ご愁傷様です. 祈っております。フランシスは大事な命。これからも心の中に生き続きますように。
need spanish sub plis :(
I have a question: why am i only seeing the low hanging fruit joke (I thought she was gonna cook the dog) now that Francis is gone? I'm sure those people don't know, but it's still very strange timing, especially since I never saw those comments when he was alive. is that just me?
I have watched your videos before I came to America, so it's possible five years ago...I really love your videos, you are the first youtuber I suscribed and I have learned so many recepies from you... I don't know how to describe my feelings after I heared this, but I really hope you can be happy again, しっかりしってください
I want to eat
Very sad.
im so sad
FUCK 2016
Get another dog that looks like Francis.
Is cute a Dog
"The same fate awaits man and animal alike". ( Genesis) Lives are taken from this world with seemingly no reason. It's all part of the mysteries of a box we wish we can see inside but cannot. Bad things sometimes happen to good people. There's no reason why things happen. They just do. No one escapes death, but just remember that whoever believes in God, and his only son that died for us, and keeps his covenant shall live eternally. God bless you all.
What was the point of the paper towel?
nuuuuu francis!!!!! first gabe now francis :<<<<
WHAT?  Francis died?  Oh, no!  How can it be called Cooking With Dog without our dear Francis?  Now I'm really upset....
Why and when did he pass?
Very sorry for your loss.
I didn't know he died I hate when dogs die this reminds me of when gabe the dog died was so sad when that happened
360度  悪霊はあなたの隣に  霊は一体、、誰 という不快な動画は、本当にクッキングウィズ ドックさんの動画ですか？ それとも乗っ取りでしょうか？((((；ﾟДﾟ)))))))  お気をつけて下さい❣️  全然フランシスも、ナレーターさんも、フランシスママも出てこない。嫌だ。料理も。
I know Francis is gone. And it is just terrible. But... I hope they continue to make videos, but more than that, I hope they adopt another dog, because people who have such love for animal, should always have one to give the love to.  I had my cat Turbo from when I was 8 years old, and he passed when I was 28.  I never knew a grief like it, but I knew I needed another animal to give my love to, because to mourn him and not honour him would be a waste  So I went to the shelter and adopted a boy and a girl puss. They helped heal my heart.  I still miss my boy, and I always will, but being able to give my love to these two makes it easier to bear.  I hope they get another pet to give their love to.
For those of you commenting about Francis, he passed away in November and there was a video about it as well. So please stop talking about it. I'm sure the chef and others don't want to see much about it and want to move on.
Please tell me that you're going to get another gray toy poodle.
francis might look happy, but secretly he's dying inside.
I'm a ghost!? No wonder my mother is always ignoring me.
Man A is the ghost. When the man placed the dog by the women with her back turned, when she saw the dog she was surprised. So that kinda gave it away. Plus she was talking to man B only and asking him if he put it there, she didn't ask anyone else.
Aww little Francis, sweet little dog.
i miss francis so much :(
It's a bit too obvious who the ghost was, honestly. The Woman and Man B were looking at each other throughout the entire convo and when it does seem like the Woman is responding to Man A, she's just talking to you. Either way, it was cool to watch Man A go around the camera/room xD
Hey, I was told that Japanese people eat KFC at Christmas... Don't tell me the Colonel died and now he is haunting Japanese people at Christmas, forever trying to bring them chicken but it's no use.
Francis will protect them from the evil.
the ghost of the DOG FRANCIS!!!!
I can move the camera!!!!!!!
I've discovered who the ghost is!! 😂😂 This was fun!
I'm very happy you guys are doing something different, best of luck
フランシスのご冥福をお祈りします。。
これからも料理チャンネルにするのでしたら、料理のみの動画を配信してください。こんなの見たくないです。
Omg this video’s ability to go 360 is freaking me out!  I keep moving my iPad around to see the rest of the room!
The guy in the pink shirt? I couldn't really tell, but it almost seemed as if he couldn't be seen by the other two people in the room.
I LOVE it. =D Was not expecting this, but it was so awesome and unique-- thank you.
Francis, we miss you. You always my protector !
#WeMissFrancis
I enjoyed this, kind of gave me a bit of paranoia lol

boi
I'm watching this late, but I thinm its man A, because none of the things the others say are in response to what he says, and both the woman and man B actually have a conversation responding to each other. Its actually fairly obvious, after a while.
It's so cool
Why does my view keep shifting to the right even though I'm not moving my phone? :/
Man a
Man A thats easy
Man A
What how is this Video made???
Wow, I’m so dumb, I didn’t even know there was a ghost LMAO - for some reason I didn’t get the black intro so I just thought this was a Christmas hangout LOL
LoL just notice i could move the camera around.
Fishing thief   乗っ取りですか？  乗っ取られましたか？  本人様に許可とっていますか？
Very very cool video! It's easy to tell it's man A if you're paying attention but that doesn't ruin the video at all. Still very entertaining.
Nice vid but I prefer to see recipes cooked 😶
대다나군
they need to unlist the other videos and have links to them so you don't get confused which video is the main video and which one is the choices. I saw a  bunch of new videos and had no idea what it was and watched the different ones and this one last lol.
お料理のチャンネルだったのに・・・こんなのになっちゃって、チャンネル解除しよ
Awww the Woman threw the Francis plush! D:
🤯 ... didn’t even care who the ghost was/is... this is DOPE!!
Why do you think it's appropriate to tell horror stories at Christmas time? This was stupid. What happened to the cooking show?
We'll miss you, Francis...
I lost it when she said "get well soon francis" :(
Francis was a big part of my life for at least three years, so I am really sad that he's gone. I hope that you are coping well.
stay strong, chef. francis will live on in all our hearts
With Chef's terrible accident and remarkable recovery, and Francis the dog's passing, you guys have been through so much, yet you keep going. Over the years, your channel has helped save and enrich my life. You guys are an inspiration, and Francis will be sorely missed.
I'm crying, I'm actually crying... My heart sank... Rest in peace, Francis ):
I hope she's coping well..
I cried when Chef told toy Francis to get well soon. This show was one of the reasons that I pursued Culinary Arts. Thank you Francis! Thank you Chef!
I felt my heart physically break at 6:18
I feared this day would come. is there a francis jr around?
Chef: get well soon, Francis! Me: 😫😭😢😥
I took a deep breath before clicking on this video.
If they get a new dog, it would be nice to always keep a picture of Francis in the background.
Just hearing her say "get well soon, Francis" and knowing that he doesn't just breaks my heart😔
"Get well soon, Francis." 

Well, that was heart-breaking :(
this episode was so sad omg
The "Get well soon, Francis" broke me. I hope Chef is alright, Francis will be dearly missed.
"Get well soon, Francis" - Feelings hit me like a truck, filled with bricks...
Hope you're doing well chef dispite these hard times. We will be here to support you!
omg the 'get well soon francis' :'(
"This recipe was shot before Francis passed away." 
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
we lost many good things in 2016. Chef Francis was one of them 😞
Francis, thank you for sharing your life with us. You brought so much joy to millions. We will miss you dearly, cute, little dog. Chef, I am so sorry for your loss, but I hope that you can take some comfort in your fond memories of Francis. Bye, Francis. 😓💔
Im sad when she says "get well soon francis" made my heart sink down. I hope that ms.chef is doing okay. She seems like such a sweet and kind person. It would hurt me alot to see her sad.
RIP Francis. Stay strong, Chef and all those who loved Francis. My thoughts are with you all. 🐶
I'm so happy that this Chanel is on but no one or anything can replace Francis😢rest in peace Francis we all love you 🐩
I'm so sorry for your loss. Francis was a lovely dog. rip sweetheart :( I hope chef continues to make videos
RIP Francis, I said this already on the other video, but, we miss you so much.  You were the best dog host.  I hope you are taking it very well Chef, Francis and you brought me and many others great joy.  We miss you Francis!!!!!♥♥♥

This actually makes me cry though. ; (
I LOVE YOU CHEF, PLEASE KEEP MAKING GREAT VIDEOS!
My heart is broken into thousands of pieces😔 I'm so so so sad that Francis is not here anymore. But chef, thanks for keeping the show🙏🏻 this is my favorite cooking show ever
well, here's hoping the show goes on. i bet that's what francis would want
I miss Francis but I'm pretty sure Chef misses him more. I hope that someday she will find another friend as loving and loyal and wonderful as he was but for now, I hope she is finding peace. And I hope she will continue to do videos because her explanations (via "Francis") have always been more clear to me than those of any show on TV!
Whoa, Chef didn't bow at the beginning. What is this madness?! Was she so worried about Francis she forgot…? :'(  Bless her for putting on a big smile for the fans even though Francis was unwell…

6:17 - Oh God. I made it through the whole video up until that point… Now there are tears in my eyes…
MY HEART HAS BEEN RIPPED OUT OF MY CHEST
Poor Chef...I'm sure she's hurting right now.  I lost it at "Get well soon Francis"
I struggled watching this episode. Have a sharp pain in my heart. RIP Francis, I love you.
When Chef told stuffed toy Francis "Get well soon", my heart dropped.
 I miss you, Francis! 💜
You can't stop these Tears!
I'll make an amazing tart in your memory.
Francis Forever!!!!!!!!!
I'm so sorry for your loss, Chef. I can understand if you want to take a hiatus after Francis died...But I would still like to see you make more videos.

If it makes you feel any better I know how it feels to lose a muse. I lost my cat Serena and struggled with my writing. It took some time but I finally got the will to go on. And you can too.

Maybe some day you'll find a new little poodle to be your host. He or she won't be the same as Francis but if he is anything like Serena was then I know he won't want you to languish about his death. He would want you to give your love to a new friend.

So if you need a hiatus take your time. But never give up.
I have been watching this channel for years. We will all miss you Francis. I hope you're happy in doggy heaven
Ohh...Francis is now cooking with God. Rest in peace  and stay strong chef.
i can't  watch this without  tearing  up TTnTT We'll  miss you!!! My chirche was delicious  TTnTT
It's so hard to believe that Francis passed away... I used to watch this show ever since I was about 13 yrs old, and watching it would always make me so happy... Rest in Peace, Francis <3 and I hope chef is doing well
Chef must be so heartbroken, the last bit of the video  hit me hard... I wonder I they will get another pup, as much as we all love Francis, a fresh face would be nice to see, new adventures await! Thank you so much for your hard  work Chef <3
rest well in heaven, Francis.. you'll be dearly missed.. luv u always.. p/s Chef, do take care of yourself!
My deepest condolence.. Thank you for sharing your life with us Francis. Wa love you and you'll be missed.
Stay strong chef and all the people who love Francis!!
Great thanks, Francis. You were an extraordinary host  in a fabulous show. I'll miss you, definitely. Let your spirit pass on , please.

We care about you and still love all your recipes; many of us will gladly continue to support any content you share with us. Cooking with Chef could be your next great success :)

Will you still post on this channel without Francis ? 
RIP Francis ☹️
We're with you, Chef. R.I.P Francis. ;~; <3
Seeing that doll sitting in Francis' perch made me cry.
"Get well soon, Francis" 6:18
that felt messed up :(
RIP over the rainbow bridge & into the great beyond, Francis ❤
Thank you so much Francis for the years!! We all love you, you're a legacy now.
I started crying once I read the note at the beginning. My heart hurts for you, Francis will truly be missed. Thank you for making such wonderful content and sharing Francis with the world. <3
MY HEART IS BROKEN For You 😢 I am so very sorry for your LOSS!! FRANCIS WAS AN AMAZING and BEAUTIFUL DOG !!

Chef, you and Francis have been such a great team. I'm sorry for your loss. Francis will be missed by so many people all across the world.
At least Francis lived a good, long life as Chef's helper. I've been watching this channel since its beginning, it's going to be really different without Francis around. :(
Chef stay strong!! Keep making video! Francis would be proud !
Chef, I am so sorry to hear about Francis!  He was so cute and well behaved.  :-(
I was doing really well with being able to watch this until she said "get well francis" and my heart just broke. RIP. You will never be forgotten

Dear Chef,

I've never been so sad while also thinking about tarts....
"Get well soon, Francis"

Those onion-cutting ninjas need to back off. :(
I know Francis is looking down on us from doggy Heaven
What a great dog Francis was! He was always so well-behaved and knew just how to be adorable at all times. No two dogs are the same, and no one could have asked for a better co-host, so let us celebrate and not forget the wonderful moments he and the rest of the Cooking With Dog crew gave us!
Your not alone Chef, were with you💗
We will miss you with all our hearts Francis😢💗
2016 has taken too many good people from us and there goes one more :'(
Rest In Peace Francis, I'll miss you forever <3

Thank you for the fun and for the food, Francis. And thank you too, Chef! <3
So sad to hear that Francis passed away :,(
I am so sorry for your loss, Chef. I don't think any of us would blame you if you put the channel on hiatus or whatever you need to do during this time of grieving. I have greatly enjoyed your videos over the years and my heart goes out to you and yours.

Francis was such a good boy and I know it'll be okay in time. All the best from way over here in Texas. Bless you.
Oh Chef, I am so sorry. Hugs and love to you. <3
I tried to hold it together the whole video and not cry, but then lost it at the end. I've watched this show for a few years now and feel as though Francis was part of my family too. I'll miss him lots and lots.
rather than being sad I'm glad Francis lived a long happy life.
Rest in peace, Francis! We will all miss you very much!
Sorry for your loss....I'm an animal lover and I'm going to miss seeing Francis on the show.
I've only just found out. Rest in peace, Francis.
This video is so very sad. Petting the stuffed Francis pup broke my heart. Rest in peace, Francis. You're a good boy. 💙 I'm so sorry, Chef.
I knew I was avoiding watching this for a reason. My heart. We miss you Francis.
'Get well soon Francis' oh my heart can't handle this 😭😭❤️❤️
So sorry to hear about Francis.  He will be missed by all.  😢
WE LOVE YOU FRANCIS! ALWAYS
I'm gonna miss Francis ): I hope that you stay strong Chef! <3 ):
FRANCIS WE MISS U ALREADY!!! </3
aun siento mucho lo de Francis 😢😢😢 I miss you Francis
How is Chef doing? I hope she's ok...
I have been watching this channel since I was in middle school. I am 20 now and almost done with university. Chef's recipes were always a hit with friends and family when I made them. Thank you so much for your videos these past 9 years, Francis and Chef are the best! Much love ❤️️
My heart sank when I realized what had happened with Francis.  We will all miss Francis sitting by your side.

Your cooking presentations are beyond excellent;  please press on.
I saw the video after this before seeing this one. I'm sorry for your loss. Francis is in the hearts of everyone who has watched your videos and enjoyed the sweet interactions between him and Chef as they make delicious recipes. Thank you so much for making yummy recipes with a cute dog!
I'm sorry about Francis - he was a good dog! You were a good owner!
Thank you Chef n Francis for giving us many many good recipes. RIP Francis and cross the rainbow bridge.Chef - if you are tired, you should take a rest, but i  hope you will continue the channel with even more recipes in memories of Francis.
I can't deal with this oh my god
Thanks you very much for the video. Francis will be missed terribly :(
I will make this in honour of Francis.
So so so sorry to hear about Francis.  Stay strong chef.  RIP Francis.
It's been a long 8 years since I've followed.. it brings me to tears hearing the news. It was so sudden. So sorry for your loss Chef! Hope your doing well!
Thank you for this video! Francis will never be forgotten!
So so sad about Francis passing away :( I hope you'll still continue the show. will definitely miss chef and your cooking.
It would be so great to have an animated version of Francis next!
Rest in peace Francis. We will never forget you. I hope chef stays strong and wish all the best to her.
I want to know as much as everyone else, but, you know -- I don't care about the answer. I love my dog more than I love anything else on the entire planet -- I can't imagine a life without him, just the thought rips me to shreds. I pray Chef continues to cook because she's wonderful, but, if this is it (if the channel won't go on because Francis is in a better place), just... thank you so much for everything. Life has been just that much better, even a little itty-bitty bit, because of Cooking With Dog. And oh my god, please, give my best to Chef. I'm so, so, so sorry for her loss.
RIP Francis. You will be missed, little darling ='(
Holy f*ck
I was surprised that Francis passed away
This is very sad...
My heart broke when I saw the teddy :(
I am sorry to hear about Francis. I will miss him. Seeing that doll there instead of him was sad.
I'm REALLY sorry about Francis :c I hope you are doing well Chef. Francis will definitely be missed! :(
You can see how sad Chef is :(
Rest in peace Francis we love you so much ❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😥😥😥
Hang in there, Chef ): I know it must be so hard on you to have lost Francis this year. We're all so sorry for your loss and we're here for you during this difficult time!
Love you, Chef! Wishing you comfort during this time.
aaaaw poor francis RIP Francis
Oh my! I'm so sorry that he passed away! :(
Rest In Peace Francis and love always
I hope you are doing okay. We all miss Francis as well :)
七年ごろ前、私の日本語クラスの文化口頭発表にはフランシスとシェフさんが私にたこ焼きを作り方のを教えてくれました。その時みんなさんは作ったたこ焼きのが大好きでした。それから「Cooking with Dog」で多くの料理を作り方のを習ってしまいました。フランシス、いろいろお世話になりました。
i first started watching this show when i was 9 years old with my mom, i completely forgot about it for the past few years and i suddenly remembered it and searched it up and it was 4 days after Francis passed away. we all love and miss you very much you will always be my childhood spirit animal💕
フランシス...
今までお疲れ様でした...
May Francis rest in peace. Stay strong! ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for being such a great host Francis! You were the best doggie host!
Francis helped me prepare so many meals and treats over the years; all my boyfriends and roommates owe my food to him TTnTT
I was still in High school, struggling to learn how to cook for my lunches when I first heard of this channel. It's already been 8 years since then and I never imagined this day would come...
I guess I just wanted to say thank you for being that channel where I learned a lot about cooking. I really loved your videos since a talking dog was a nice touch and I looked forward to seeing him all cute and funny on cam. Hearing about Francis really shook me hard, but I can't imagine how Chef must feel. Condolences, CWD.
😞😭
Francis, we'll miss you
While it's sad that Francis is gone, this channel is called "CookingWithDog". When they are ready, they can bring in a new dog to start cooking with. I really don't want to see this channel end.
I still can't believe Francis is not with us anymore... :(
Oh my gosh, I'm crying! My heart hurts.
I've been watching your videos for so long and I'm so sorry about him. As a chief his yummy recipes should live on! I know it's hard but it gets better I promise please continue to make more lovely cooking videos I'm sure Francis want to.
I miss Francis, but I hope you keep doing videos.  This has been my favorite YouTube channel for about 7 years.
R.I.P francis... he is in a better place now 🙏
WHAT!? I didn't know... Francis. NOOO WHY.. :(
I truly miss you Francis. Thank you for the love you gave us and rest in peace in dog Heaven. 悲しいけど凄く可愛がってもらって幸せだったね! いつまでも忘れないよ!
oh noooo francisssss i will miss him rip....
Rest In Peace, Francis!  My condolences to you and your family, chef.  Please take care.
That upcoming recipe looks so good! Rest in peace Francis.
I'm so sorry for your loss Chef :(. Francis will be missed very much 😢.
"this was shot before francis passed away." my heart shattered
The dough is so pretty! Mine always looks lumpy and kind of blotchy colored. :D I'm glad you're still recording videos.
<3 Francis. :(
I love you so much Francis. Im 15 and have been watching for 3 years. Thank you so much for bringing me joy.
R.I.P Francis. we will not forget francis 😢

Francis has passed away? Oh my god! All my support to you guys.

Sweet Francis will be missed.

Francis will always have a special place in my heart but I will still watch this channel if Chef gets a new dog.

Rest in peace, dear Francis. You were a good dog. We all miss you, but you'll never really be gone, because you're always in our hearts, in our cravings for yummy food and on youtube in past videos.
It killed me when she said "get well soon Francis " at the end :(( stay strong!!
Omg I can't believe Francis is gone... You will be missed... May you rest in peace
thank you for forward another fantastic video, I miss so much Francis and I know that for you is more difficult, but I think that Francis could want ( the show must go on). I love you so much everyone. Ciao. your italian friend.
It was shocking that our cool and little chef passed away.
But no life can escape from death.
My condolences. I always watch your video's.. rest in peace. :')
Thank you for all the yummy recipes and the sweet, family atmosphere in these videos =]
I remember watching Cooking with Dog for years. I forgot about this channel for a few months because I havent been on YouTube as much as I used to now that I have a job. When I saw this as recently uploaded I was like oh god its been a while so I clicked on this video and when I saw the caption in the beginning about Francis passing away I was shocked .-. </3 RIP little one
I love these videos so much and I've been following for 5 years...but I still kind of am not looking forward to the day a new video recorded without him comes out. I support completely! But it'll be hard...keep moving forward, Chef. And thank you
My heart is broken, but I'm happy that you can still make videos. ♡
Que tristeza como eu vou sentir falta tanta falta do Francis 😔😖😢💔🐾 não acabem com o canal, por favor🙏

it' so sad watching this vid, but i am glad that francis lived a good life QAQ
Please don't stop cooking, making videos and what not. I love your cooking Chef. Though Francis would be missed greatly I think it would be more of a shame to close this YT channel or stop making videos. :( You can dedicate every new video to Francis's memory.
Is this it then. Is this the last episode? :(
Sorry to hear about Francis. I hope chef will continue to make videos though.
Francis I miss you so much
oh no 😢 we will miss you ❤
This was the beginning 😭..
Francis already passed away on November 6, 2016 i guess as it was posted on their facebook page.
I just found out...my most heartfelt apologies. I've lost a doggie before and it was the toughest times I've ever had to go through. RIP Francis. ;_;
I love you so much Francis :(
I cried.
Chef, your face reveals this taping isn't the same without your Francis. Our sympathies to you and your family. We love you, Chef and Francis!
Thank you, chef! I hope that you continue to make videos, but I understand if you don't want to. This channel has brought many smiles to my life over the years, so thank you for everything, regardless of the decision you make.
Can't watch this any longer, sorry
Feels are getting to me
But stay strong Chef. We love you and Francis
Francis will for ever be missed...he was the best host  ever :(
どのコメもフランシスの心配の声なのかな。。。
英語読めんからFrancisに反応してるだけだけど。。。

It still doesnt feel like Francis has really left us. You and him have been absolutely amazing and I'm sure we all appreciate that you're still bringing out videos, though I wouldn't blame you if you decided to stop. I hope you're doing well Chef, all my love <3
Please never stop posting. I can't not have Francis and Cooking with Dog. If there is ever a new dog, it'll take time to adjust but I much rather have that than no more episodes.
We'll really miss you, Francis! All the love!
NOOO FRANCIS😭
rest in peace, good dog!
I'm so sorry about Francis. D: My 21-year-old cat just passed away very recently too. Big hugs and best wishes from Canada. <3

Oh, I'm so sad to hear about Francis. I will miss him😥
I'm very sorry to hear the news about Francis. RIP Francis, you will be missed.
I wish they would do a tribute video to Francis... we all love him and miss him! Sorry for your loss, Chef 😭
im actually crying my heart is hurting
Damn, when i see  the Francis' plush , my eyes were watering...
it had been a while since I've watched videos from you guys and I only remembered now :c I hope you are coping well and I'm positive that we all miss Francis very much.
rip :(
it may have been the entire bottle of wine i've had tonight but this made me straight up sob
You and Francis got me into baking for my career... I am not sure if it was because of being pregnant or not, but I cried the whole time for this video. But it wasn't just sad tears, because Francis was an old man who led a good life. I think I will watch some of my favorite Francis and Chef videos
Stay strong chef ❤️
</3 Francis
Sending lots of love to Chef. I will miss Francis,  he always made me smile.
chef's face.. looks so sad while cooking. no bright smile as usual :(
Goodbye Francis you're a very good boy, you are greatly missed.
RIP Francis bby...
can't focus on video, missing Francis too much.
RIP Francis.
what a hurting news!!! Iam so sad. Francis used to draw a smile on my face whenever I watch the videos. I will miss you Francis.
rest in peace Fanccis
That was really painful to watch. :(
Yeah, I cried when Chef wished Francis a get well soon.
We miss you Fracnis! <3
2016 was a wild year. #RIPFrancis
That's so sad.  Condolences, we'll miss him too.
Me rompio el corazon el final...😢
RIP FRANCIS
I feel terrible now for only keeping up with the channel and not other social media platforms as well. Kia Kaha Chef.
RIP Francis, I sure enjoyed watching you cook with Chef. I hope that Chef is doing okay, I can feel her sadness from all the way here in the US...Big hugs...
So sorry for your loss. May he rest in piece in doggy heaven!
I remember being in culinary school years back and interested in Japanese desserts. I loved Francis.
2016 just takes and takes and takes
:(
Very sorry for the loss of francis...it's like losing a child almost...i hope everything is well in your grieving journey. Take all of the time you need. We'll miss him very dearly...
Rest in peace, Francis... you will truly be missed.
Francis >~<
Rest in peace, Francis. You touched many more lives than you will ever know. Thank you for everything.
Francis has been in my life for 6 years 😭😭 I hope chef is doing well and coping healthily
I'm so sorry for your loss. I looked forward to him in every video. He will be missed.
Wish I had a wooden roller & platform like Chef used.   It would be perfect if those metal bands were interchangeable for different thicknesses, & moveable for different diameters!   Sad about Francis.  He was the reason I watched my first Cooking With Dog video & subscribed immediately.  Hope Chef is OK.
Sweet Francis. 8'-(
oh noo! i am so sorry! hope your place in heaven is as awesome as it was on earth. keep helping the chef up there. have a save journey....
Am I the only one who can bear watchin the video until the end? I'm sad watchin how Chef tryin to hold her emotion. 
I barely notice this video, and curious how can it be this show goes without Francis. 
Chef, be strong. I know we all miss and love Francis, even as not as much like you do. 
I'm sure Francis happy to have a great life with you 
😭😭😭
I'm so thank god to life witness the story of you and Francis.
OMG IM CRYING NOOOOO
Wait what Francis Died? No this was my favorite show😭 I am going to miss him rip Francis we love you!
I feel bad that Francis is gone I sense sadness from Chef & the Narrator. 
I wonder if they are going to clone Francis cause Japan has a cloning lab for people who can pay for cloning their beloved pets.
Please make some japanese traditional cake or wagashi :)
:(..........……
Repose en paix, Francis.
This is the most heart breaking news :( rest easy Francis
WHAT! FRANCIS IS NO MORE? I M DYIN.. OMG NOOO... :( this is so so sad :'(... this channel wont be the same anymore
what about a channel called cooking with cat.

RIP Francis. Such a good dog.
You can see how sad chef is for Francis not being around her. RIP Francis we will live in our hearts forever.😥😥😥
I'm so sorry to hear about Francis.  How lucky he was to be so loved.
whats the point of living anymore
My condolences.  I'm sad to hear the passing of Francis but I know he has crossed the rainbow bridge and now at a happier place!

:'(
Oh my.. Francis passed away.. Sorry for your loss.. ;__;
We will always miss Francis <3

I miss Francis very much-I hope the chef will still give us wonderful recipes and I hope she can gradually adjust to the life without Francis. He is still with us in our hearts chef, and I know he loves you very much.

はじめまして
韓国人のファンです。一度、上手じゃない私の日本語ですがよかったら嬉しいです！
いつもビデオで日本語とお料理をたくさんならいました。そして犬がスキな私にはフランシスちゃんを見たら、気持ちがよかったでした。今フランシスちゃんは天国で元気にいるとchefさんも多分私と同じに思うで安心してほしいね。今度の映像を見るとchefさんがもうちょっと寂しい気がすると思いますけど100万人が越える視聴者たちが応援してる事を覚えてこれからももっと頑張ってください！よろしくお願いします♡韓国から応援します()♡
RIP Francis
I know I should be positive and shit. And he was loved and bla bla. But watching this video makes me feel like "Grave for the fireflies" is not such a sad movie after all. Oh Lord I'm crying so hard.
Rest In Peace, Francis san. Chef- please stay strong. You have a large online family that are grieving with you.
R.I.P Francis😢

Franciss nooo 😭😭😭😭
1. Is there a reason why that we should put in the tart pan in the freezer/fridge?
2. Does the tart case shrink during baking? It seems that the tart case was moving away from the edges.....
Francis noooooooo! I'm devastated! It may be silly to cry but I can't help it! He was so cute! We're going to miss you Francis!
Poor Francis 😢😢😢😢 RIP
R.I.P. Francis :(

いつも見ていました。
ずっとフランシスを画面越しに見て
可愛いな〜シェフが動く度に
反応してて可愛いな〜と動画を見る度に思っていました。大人しくシェフの横に座り賢い子でしたね。すごく悲しいです。動画を開けばいつでもフランシスに会えるので過去動画漁ってきます。
今日はいい天気なので上からシェフを見守り遊んで駆け走ってると思いますよ😺💗また会いたいですね。
I started bawling like a baby at the last part. ;o;

ガンバて！！
awww I feel sad now :(
Rip 😢
So I thought I got over the news about Francis and was thinking they're going to use that felt plushie that was made a while ago, it'll have Francis' voice and everything's going to be okay. Dude chef only said "Get well soon Francis" and I bawled my eyes out.
フランシス旅立ったんですね。寂しいです。安らかに。
My condolences, and internet hugs.
FRANCIS :'((
wait what nooo
rest in peace Francis :(
I really hope you get another dog <3

So many things happened in 2016...Francis passing hit me the hardest.
NOOOOOO!!!! Francis :´(
My condolences to the chef and the family ;( May Francis rest in peace. 14 years and a couple of months is a long life for a dog. I pay my respects to the fulfilling and happy life Francis has lived. He was really loved by everyone. Stay strong!
I'm crying, I'
NOOOOO, NOT FRANCIIIIIIS!
Rip Francis :(
bring francis narator to the screen :3
0:40キンキンに冷えてやがる
This channel has shown us all the positive things social media can do in our lives. Even though most of us are a very long distance from Chef & Francis, they have become a part of our lives & we rejoice as well as mourn with them. I don't think it's too much to say that they are almost like a part of the family to many of us.
I was so hoping that Francis was still here and the article i read was a catch :( rip francis
R.I.P. Francis
😭😭😭
the 2 people who disliked this video are terrible!

I've been watching this channel for about six years now. It's very sad to hear that Francis passed away. I've never seen him personally, but I still feel very close to him. He was a good chef, and he will be missed.
Je suis désolée d'apprendre le décès de Francis 😢 J'ai toujours eu des chiens et je sais à quel point c'est horrible. Courage à son/ses maître(s) et j'espère que la chaîne continuera quand même. 😢

チェフさん達の事はみんな考えているから、元気出して下さいね。みんなおえんしていますからね。
こういう時に何をすればいいか分かりませんけど、せめて気持ちを伝えたかったです。
I miss you Francis
I've been following this channel since 2008. The iconic "Hi, I'm Francis, the host of this show, Cooking with Dog" will forever play in my head whenever I cook any dish, Japanese or otherwise. I'm so sorry to hear about his passing and hope everyone who has worked to make this channel great is doing okay. Hopefully we will continue to get great recipes from our favorite obaa-san
悲しいすぎますよ。
I feel like crying.
Chef, I am so sorry for your loss. I want you to know that we all care about you, and that if you need to take a break from making videos that it's okay. You're an amazing woman, and you and Francis have taught me so much. Thank you so much for everything.
💟🐶😭
😪
I thought no more videos

When will we expect Francis II?
rest in peace Francis.

The crust was delicious, but how can a stuffed animal replace Francis?!
Poor Francis 😢
Poor francis
The dog has the culinary degree the woman is just an assistant
Knnn
T-T RIP Francis....
i hope the dog is okay ^_^
I broke down and cried for a good portion of the video. Francis, he was a good host. I will miss him so, even after a year has passed.
I am sorry for your loss. I lost my dog not to long ago so I understand how you are feeling.
Omg
RIP Francis.
Francis no !
I still can’t believe Francis has passed away. It just feels unreal because he has always been here for us Cooking with Dog subscribers and for Chef. He was just the most wonderful and most playful dog. =(
:'(
I'm really gonna miss Francis
🙁😖😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I was thinking about making pies and tarts - thanks Chef and thanks Francis
Poor Francis
When I saw this video upload I was like no way are they making a new video.. then I clicked it and it I couldn't stop crying for a few minutes as someone who's watched your videos for years and a dog lover with 4 dogs its so hard it's like one of my own dogs died. But all dogs go to heaven and I know for sure Francis is happy up there. Stay strong.
miss Francis
My condolences for Francis passing away. I know how much it hurts when you lost your dog that you love so much u.u
where is fancis ? i don't see fancis along time ?
天国にいきましたね。いつもむりありにお隣に座らせて可哀想でした。
dog death
X'(
omg i havent watch this in many years where is francis?????
What happened to the dog? Why is there a plush doll? I'm so confused
I honestly want this channel to go on. I hope they can figure something out.
Nooooooooooo!!!!! What!!!! When ?!!!  How?! Why is there so much death!!!??? 😭😭😞
So what happens now?
Where dog?
What happened to Francis? :(
I'm sorry for your loss 😭😫😕
I'm sorry for your loss, Chef. We lost our poodle last year and my mom lost her Chihuahua shortly after Francis's passing. Hopefully they are enjoying their afterlife.
;______________;
So sorry.
so... get another dog. idk why they wouldn't. it's not called "cooking with francis", just "dog". get another dog
i am so sad, animals don't deserve to die :-(
where is your dog?
Are you still going to make videos??
we miss you Francies! 😢😢 I hope everyone will never forget you.
狗主人是不是死了
😭we will muss you francis❤
I can make a picture of Francis because I'm an artist
i have no food proseser can i do this with hand mixer?
annnd...there's the ugly cry
🍤🍜🍥🍣🍱🍛🍙🐩
I wonder if they will adopt a dog from a shelter to inherit his legacy. I wonder if it will be a Shiba? #AdoptDontShop
I'm sorry about Francis..but maybe they will get a new dog and have a new host eventually after grieving for a little.... maybe a francis jr.?
💗🐾Francis🐾💗
When my sister tell me about this channel i was only watch chocolate cake,...
Sou o unico BR aqui?
i am so very sorry that Francis is not with us anymore...
Francis dead!?
hora cartoon?
Very sorry for your loss.
where is the dog ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
hey, please don´t interrupt the channel! keep them coming!
Francis is in better place now... 😭
I might be about to weep and I'm only at the 00:24 mark...
Get a new dog and continue filming, we all love your show!! Fighting!!
why does the whole thing have to be so cold from the beginning until right before baking? at every stage everything has to be fridge cold.
My heart is broke so bad now... RIP Francis...
Can 2016 get any worse
Honestly crying so much. This hit me so hard. Been subscribed to this channel since 8th grade and now I'm in my second year of college. Francis will be missed and my condolences to Cooking With Dog.
i think for about 1.2 million, a little part of them died after reading the start of this video
RIP Francis :(
This hit me in my feels so bad. I grew up watching this. 
RIP Francis.
;-;
You will be missed.
We will miss him :( thank you for all the videos Francis
Sorry for your loss.  Thank you for letting us know.  We all have to go sometime.  I'm sure you gave him a good life
First time I'm crying while watching a recipe video. 

We'll miss you lovely Francis.
This channel has been such an experience.  I remember years and years ago enjoying it with my old friends and always bringing it up whenever we had the chance.  I loved introducing it to my girlfriend and she has gotten so  much joy out of it for many years. Francis will always be special to us, however, please don't stop cooking for us, Chef.  Good luck in the kitchen.
I came here to watch a cute cooking video with a cute cooking dog but I all got were tears :'(( rip Francis
So sorry to hear about francis' passing. My condolences to everyone at Cooking with Dog.
So sad! But Francis lived to a very old age for a dog, and for that, we must be grateful. ^-^
I'm so sorry for your loss. Even though 14 years is a great age for a dog, it still feels far too soon. Cherish the memories.
sleep tight pupper
i am so sad to hear about francis, but he lived a long and happy life. i'll miss his little hungry face. <3
A "Coming Soon".... I wonder if the next video still has Francis in it. Or maybe a new dog to continue Francis' legacy?
The dog speaks better english than I do...
I'm so sorry for your loss :( Please don't stop making videos--we love you Chef (and Chef's son)
I have already read about it in the comments of the last video. I was very sad. I started watching this channel years ago, it might even have been the first channel, that I ever subscribed to.
Francis was so cute and it was obvious, that chef loved him, I am very sorry for your loss.
The news didn't seem real until your channel finally said it. Condolences to Chef & the production, Francis will be missed. It won't be the same without him.

Please don't stop making video.
thankyou so much for all the years of cooking with dog. I actually got quite emotional to hear of his passing and am incredibly honoured to have learned from you since the beginning. I wish her the best and hope she isn't too sad from Francis' passing! ARIGATO GOZAIMASU!
Francis will be missed, may he rest in peace.
14 years and 9 months was a very good age for a poodle...
My grandparents poodle, my guard dog as baby and toddler, was about the same age as Francis, when he passed away.
Francis was a happy dog for sure and that's all you can want.
You will never be forgotten!
you don't understand how much Francis has influenced my life. I will miss him so much.
I have never before cried after watching a cooking video. 

RIP - Francis...and condolences to Chef.
We love you Francis! You will be missed
Thank you for keeping us in mind with Francis. He was an amazing host! In his memory, I hope you continue to make videos, because both he and the show have always brightened my days. We will forever miss him.
I'm glad Francis had such a wonderful, loving mom in Chef. I hope you and the producer are doing whatever you need to do for the grieving process.
Rest well Francis.
We know you ate more of those meals than the rest of us.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for giving me those light and soothing moments of watching you stare at the cook while chopping away with the ingredients.
We love you.
:)
I've been a fan of this show for years and I will continue to be a fan no matter what happens. Francis will be very missed, but I wish him the best in the afterlife. Thank you for all of your wonderful videos!
For all the high-profile deaths of 2016, Francis's was the one that hit me the hardest (no, really). I wasn't surprised when the time came because over the past year he looked visibly older, but it was still sad. It was three days before our elections... perhaps the world was telling me something. It's only appropriate that two of his last recipes were collaborations- he had many friends and all of us will miss him dearly.

There is no substitute for Francis much like there is no substitute for a deceased pet, but I do hope this channel goes on, somehow.
My heart is broken. I have been watching Francis and his lovely chef make amazing food for the last 6 years. I wait for each and every new video and I love them all. Rest in peace, sweet Francis, Cooking with Dog will never be the  same without you.
Arigato gozaimasu, Francis-san.
Francis I recently came across your videos and loved your cooking techniques and was always worried your bangs would catch fire but they never did! I never met u but I miss u already! Luv u Francis!!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍
Please make a memorial video...
Your channel has given me great self confidence in cooking. I have enjoyed all of your videos with him. I will miss him so much. Cooking with dog will always be one of my favorite channels. Thank you so much for everything you both have given me. Love everyone in this show.
Ohh.. I am so saaadd! May you be comforted by the outpouring of love surrounding you

I'm so sorry for your loss, RIP Francis definitely the heart of this channel x
This video is is sad tbh
That's so sad :( We will miss you, Francis!
I'm so sad for your loss but i'm also happy because Francis no doubt lived a long, happy life and no one could have asked for better. 
RIP Francis, you'll be in our hearts always.
Aw Francis I have been watching your videos since 2007!  You will be missed <3
It's so sad to know that our Francis is no longer here ;(
Even I as a viewer who have subscribed this channel almost 2 years are sad to know Francis had passed away ;(( I can't imagine how sad our Chef and other viewers who have followed this channel earlier than me ;((
I'm sure Francis now in a better place in heaven, and also find strength to Chef. I mean it. Really.
I don't know how things turn next with this channel... but as a viewer, I would be very sad if this channel stop their recipe videos. But in other situation, I can't imagine if I see Chef's sad face without Francis in the next video...
However it is, I will always support this channel and their decision.
I love both of Chef and Francis, and also other parties who have been helped to make this lovely recipe videos.
Thank you for always giving us an inspirative menu ;;;;;;;
I'm terribly sorry to hear the news. Treasured friends like your furry companion are missed by all when they pass on, and their fond memories live on forever in our hearts. Wishing you comfort and peace in your time of need. Francis will be dearly missed.

Also, please continue making your videos. 
Your fans will still be here to support you, Chef. ❤

I do wonder how cooking with dog will continue without Francis v.v I'm gonna miss that little guy...
I've been watching this channel for years, back when I was in high school. Your videos with Francis got me into trying new foods and cooking more advanced meals. I will never forget these videos and Francis, with his cooking wisdom. Thank you so much for many years of fun, informative videos.
So sorry for your loss :(((( its so sad that this happened. But please continue making videos i love this channel. 14 years is good. Francis lived a full life looking at delicious foods :3
I read about it on Twitter, the day after it happened. Sad :( I do hope the hostess is doing alright. Francis was definitely her furry ball of love. We will definitely miss you, Francis.
We Love you Francis ❤ R.I.P. 😢
Francis will be remembered because people will keep watching this channel.
NO! 😭😭😭😭😭 WHY ITS GUNNA BE FRANCIS ?!😣😣😣 TAKE MY NEIGHBORS INSTEAD 😤😤😤😤😢😢😢 rip francis 🐾🐩😭😭😢
Thank you for all the amazing videos you have been and always will be a huge part in, dear Francis. Cooking with dog was one of the first youtube channels I subscribed to, and I made so many of your tasty meals. 
You will be kept in the best and most loving memories.

All the best and lots of love for the Chef of our hearts. You went through such hard times, I hope you find much comfort and solace.
Francis had a wonderful life! In time you may open your heart to another animal that needs you. Thanks for everything you do.
rest in piece Francis, we will love you forever :(
Oh jesus, that broke my heart. Explained to everyone in the office around me about Francis and how he would sit/curl up which Chef cooked awesome things. Now everyone here is sad. :(
RIP Francis. Hopefully the plan is to have the narrator wear a dog costume and stand next to chef in future episodes
We will miss Francis so much. Hope chef's doing well after his passing. 😭
We're going to miss you Francis, I'm going to have to cook up some pork kakuni or chicken karaage in his honor now.
We will miss you Francis. Thank you for all the deliciousness
RIP Francis. You helped introduce me to great cooking at home.
Francis... :'( I know its a little late, but I'm so sorry for your loss. It won't be the same without him, but I know he's in a better place!
What will happen to this channel? Will you continue? I'll still watch the lady she's sweet. I love her! There should be a rip Francis video
I found out about Francis's passing the other day, not long after I started watching this show again. I wanted to cry watching this video. But it's a relief to know the show's not over, at least not yet.
I have been watching this program for quite a long time.  I have enjoyed all of the recipes that Chef prepared with Francis by her side.  Francis, may you rest in peace  & be happy in Heaven. Chef, may your loss of this beloved dog be eased and may you be comforted.  Hopefully you will consider continuing the program.
No! I knew this day was coming but it's still so saaaad
What's gonna happen to this channel with Francis gone???
I've been following you since 2009. This channel was my first introduction into Japanese cuisine. I teared up watching this last video. I loved Francis a lot. He was a good dog. These videos taught me how to make udon, curry, tamago, tempura, croquettes, omurice and more. This channel inspired me to cook these Japanese recipes and even visit Japan. Thank you Francis, I'll miss you. And Chef, please don't stop cooking. This channel is wonderful and i'll follow you guys till the end.
What a great happy life Francis!! You will be missed.
My heart hurts so much. Francis brought so much happiness to all of us: Thank you for sharing him and all of your wonderful recipes with the world.
OMG chef I'm so sorry! It's not easy to lose a family member as sweet and as cute as Francis! I hope time heals and that you are able to find another puppy who will warm your heart when  you are ready.
rip francis :( i lost both my pets this year (an old cat and a young dog) so i know how devistating it is. i hope everyone feels better soon u_u
I remember making your famous and delicious Omurice! TT__TT It was the first recipe I tried from a yt channel. You will be missed Francis!
RIP, Francis....you will be missed dearly.
been watching since 2009 :(((((( francis rip
Run free over the Rainbow Bridge, Francis.
I remember when I was in 7th grade I found this channel. I'm now about to graduate from highschool and am still watching. I have great memories of watching your videos and trying my hand at making my own delicious food. Thank you Chef and Francis, for the memories and for the fun.
Oh no... this made me and my daughter really sad, we're glad he lived the happy life he did though.
Thank you for sharing the love for Francis with us, Chef! You are dearly missed, Francis.

All the best to the channel from here on!
Omg this is so sad R.I.P. Francis 😢😭
RIP Francis. We'll miss you. <3
I've been dreading this day for so long as I lay here crying in bed, thinking about all the times Francis (and the Cooking With Dog Team) has been there for me when no one else was. Bringing my spirits and my passion for life back up when I was younger. For 8 years I've loved Francis' quiet and loving background presence in every video. It's so saddening to see this, but I do know his spirit will be in every video that is to come in the future. Thank you for bringing me all those years of happiness. My heart is with Chef and the Team in this time of sadness. Rest In Peace My Sweet Francis. ❤️🎈
Wahhhh Francis last video😭😭😭you’ll always be in our hearts ♥️ god bless you all and Francis ❤️♥️
😔 I'm so sorry for y'all loss. He seemed like a very sweet dog.
Such a good doggo... Love you Francis..!
The lady who cook is absolutely amazing
Francis's passing confirms it. 2016 is just the worst.
I was afraid that this will happen, didn't expect it to happen this early. Francis will be missed 😢
2016 is not a good year...
Rest In Peace Francis...... don't stop making videos keep making them for Francis sake we love Francis and the channel so much please don't stop
It was thanks to y'all 2 that I got confident enough to make Japanese food and food in general and I love it!
Don't stop! おねがいします!
I hope the chef stay strong. Goodbye Francis, you will stay in our hearts. 
Sorry for the loss, thanks for all the years of recipes. Really, thanks.
rest in puppy peace, francis. he will be missed.
The show will not be the same without him, but I hope the crew is doing alright after the loss. This is quite the surprise, and it makes me very sad that I won't be able to watch anymore future videos with this cute little pup in them. Best wishes to the crew.
Oh, no! RIP Francis! You'll always be missed :'(
rest in peace...❤️😢
Thank you so much! Have been following your video since 2009. Love your receipts! I'm so sorry to hear the news. Thank you Francis and please don't stop making the video! We all love you! ❤️
I'm so sorry for both of you. When I heard about Francis I was so sad, and I couldn't help but worry about Mrs. Chef and her husband. I lost my dog almost a year ago too, and I miss her dearly - Francis reminded me a lot of her, and watching your videos helped me grieve. Maybe the two of them are playing together is heaven.
He is a very loved pooch.
I'll always remember him fondly, knowing he moves on to a good life. None of it possible without the love from Chef.

Love you Francis <3
You taught me so much Francis. I am deeply in debt to you and Chef for all that I've learned and all the hours of happiness you've given me. 
Rest in peace pooch. You were a very very good dog and you will be greatly missed.
Goodbye, Francis! RIP
But Francis loved Chef's and our cooking ;-;
RIP my beautiful Francis...
You were amazing dog.... 
we love you <3
much respect
RIP Francis🐶🙏. I've been subscribed for almost 8 years and this is devastating 💔 Thank you for all the work you have done and I'm glad he had a good life.
鯖の押し寿司美味しそうですね。

I'm so sorry to hear about your loss....he will be missed. thanks for all the great videos you and Francis gave us!! he seemed like a very happy and loved Lil boy💞
Omg Chef I'm sooo sorry for your loss... I can especially sympathize with you as my Toy Poodle Shadow just passed away last night. He was over 12 years old. I've had him since I was 13.. Watching him pass was the hardest thing I've gone through in a while. Both your Francis & my Shadow are at peace now & will be forever missed & loved <3
Sorry for your loss Chef. Bless Francis in doggie heaven. Thank you for all the videos. Xx Australia
RIP Francis. I'm so sorry for your loss. I've loved your channel since it's early days. Francis will be so missed.
are you going to continue the show!!?? please continue making video I've been a big fan for 5 years !!!
I am very sorry to hear about Francis. I truly wish that Fracis is now in a better place and further, will have a wonderful afterlife awaits ahead. Also, I hope you can get over the situation and keep on doing the show in the name of Francis as a memory to remember. Goodluck to you. With love, from Vietnam.
I'm certain Francis will wait for his family patiently after he has crossed the bridge of Sanzu River like the true trustworthy k9 he is. Until reunited, he will truly be missed
Oh my god. I'm so sorry about that.. I remember Francis whenever I cook. So sad. And thank you Fransic, I believe u must go peaceful place. 😥❤️
March of 2017 and I'm still bothered by Francis' death. He really did make the show just a bit more special.
:( so sad. Francis was the best.
Bless Francis, and his heart in doggy heaven =(
Sleep tight, pupper  ;  ^  ;
What a beautiful dish!
RIP Francis <3
I actually started weeping NO FRANCIS
r.i.p. Francis! 
best Japanese cooking show ever..
i hope it will go on..qq
rip Francis - it was a fine life full of good smells
its been a while but im hoping youre okay. it must be hard losing a pet after living with him for so long
Francis🐶 you'll be missed dearly 😥 love you Francis💜
My heart just broke😭 I'm so sorry! He was such a loyal dog and just the best cooking companion. I'm just lost of words. I've been watching this since this account started..💔
I was so sad to learn of Francis' passing. What a great little host he was. I hope you can take some small comfort in knowing how much he was loved all around the world!
are you guys going to keep making videos without francis? I have been watching your show since I was 12, I am ow 22 and I would be so sad to lose my favourite cooking show :( 

Francis was an amazing host and beautiful dog <3
Poor Francis. I'll miss him. I'm glad Chef is still teaching us lovely recipes
why i never knew this channel & that adorable dog exist?  now he's gone :(
we wont forget you francis :'). 

Rest in piece 🙏🏻
RIP Francis 
you were the best
Looking and noticing the old age of Francis becoming more apparent with each video, I sadly expected it was coming over the next couple of months. I'm not surprised, yet I am saddened by his passing. 14 years is an impressive age for a small/medium-sized dog and it is testament to him living a good and healthy life with his loving owners. Thank you for taking such good care of him and for allowing us to indirectly take part in his life through your cooking channel! 💗🐩
Oh Francis... I'm so glad to have been able to watch all these videos over the years, you happy wee sweetheart <3
I just heard about the news today, and honestly, I feel like crying...
i feel a deep sadness for his death.
But what will happen to the show now? It was such a lovely time
I'm not saying replacing Francis or anything
I'm just curious.

He will be missed forever :<
We all love you Francis!
You are such a good dog <3
Rest in Peace
i'm actually crying I've been watching this show for so long... Francis will be missed  <3 :(
I always dreaded this day but I knew it would come...

I remember reading a comment about this a couple of years ago, someone said that they dreaded the day that Francis would pass, or something along those lines.

And now it's truly here.

R.I.P. Francis ❤
Cooking with dog is the first youtube cooking channel whose recipe i followed. francis and chef inspired me to cook. ❤ he will be dearly missed ❤
No!~ Francis-sama!~ I'm gonna miss Francis so much! This show won't be the same without him. T^T
So sorry to hear that. Our deep condolences, RIP Francis. 
We will miss him...
Rest in piece, Francis. May you find a lovely kitchen in heaven to chill in.
Be one with those things, that having lived and blossomed, return to the quiet where they came from. 
R.I.P Francis. We will miss you.
I think for future videos I'd love to see just the Francis plush assistant sitting in the bed next to chef. That way it's still always in memory of Francis.
Oh my god... im just tearing up just to hear about Francis... ill be miss him. Rip sweetheart🙏🏻🐶

My Poodle was the same age when he died. He was there from my angry teens when I hated him, and he hated me back, and was there in my early thirties, when he was going blind, and cuddled in my arms a peaceful loving dog. He now lays in my back yard, forever loved, never forgot. RIP Otie, and RIP Frances, my condolences to all friends, family and fans. Thank you so much for making these videos. Poodles are best dog.
Awe no! :(
Sweet Dreams, Francis.... What a sad morning.

This is actually the most depressed I've ever been watching a cooking video...
I heard about Francis on twitter. I love shimesaba so thank you for this!!!! All the best.
I was happy to see a new video but  destroyed when I read that Francis passed. Thoughts and prayers to the crew, all who knew Francis and especially chef. 😭
Farewell Francis and RIP.

:C 
Francis!! <3 best host ever. u.u
awww 😭 you will be missed francis. :(
RIP Francis 💔💙 forever in our hearts
I've been watching your channel since I was in middle school. I was fascinated by the different dishes, ingredients, and culture of Japanese food. The small dog who hosted this cooking show made me love it that much more, with his precious and heavy accent and his expertly styled hair. I loved Cooking with Dog then and I love Cooking with Dog now. 
I am now a senior in high school and reality has hit hard. Francis is loved and missed by so many people, he was such a sweet dog. I hope you and him are able to cook again across the rainbow road. Much love to you and your crew, Chef. Your fans will respect your privacy and send their love and support. 
From the east coast of the USA, sending love. I'll miss you, Francis.
Oh my heart aches for you, Ch
I am very sorry cooking with dog, Francis will have a very good life in heaven and I will pray for him. It definitely will be hard without him, but don't worry. I hope you have a great day and Francis will always be with you.
I was sorry to hear about Francis.   (Thank you Francis!)

I hope you will still keep making these videos.
I love you francis <3 you will be missed, my heart is with you Chef. I will enjoy this video and remember all the times Chef and Francis made me laugh!
My heart is breaking....  i will miss you Francis.   Both you and Chef gave me so much joy over the years.  My condolences to Chef and her family.
RIP Francis. <3
I extend to you my most heartfelt sorrow and condolences. May you find comfort in loving memories.
I started watching these videos back in 2010. I am so sad to hear the news, he will be very missed! I will continue to watch these wonderful videos! Thank you for them and sharing Francis!
I have watched this show since 2011, don't think there's any recipe from this channel I've not seen. Breaks my heart knowing Francis has passed. He may be gone now but he's really never gone! I'll still watch this show every week and look forward to many more years of cooking with dog videos to come. Stay positive chef!
Thank you for teaching us how to cook, Francis. We will always be grateful.
I would usually come back to this channel one or twice every few months, let the recipies build upso I can mini binge.  I was so excited to see two videos.  I watched the first one, perfectly fine.  Then this one.   There isn't ever going to be another dog as great as Francis, all of your viewers, me included, loved him as much as you did.   I'm glad he was able to live out his life, and bring joy to many people.    Francis was two months younger than me, and thats a long life for a dog.   I'm really upset about him being gone, but I'm glad he lived so nicely.
I'm literally crying while watching this recipe video. 😭😭 good bye Francis.
We're so SAD, we didn't expect that... Rest in peace Francis... We'll love you forever from Paris, and never forget you.
I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm drinking one for you tonight Francis, heres to you.
I learned a lot about cooking from this channel, and I have been subscribed for practically the whole time. I felt devastated when I heard about Francis' passing, I stayed home and cried. this wonderful channel has calmed me and taught me so much I will always cherish every memory I have with this fantastic  community.
heartbreaking :( I can't continue watching the episode because I'm crying so hard. We'll miss you Francis.
Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear this! He was such a sweet looking dog ): I'm happy to know he had such a caring and kind owner that gave him a happy life tho.

This is terrible, I hope Francis rests in peace. I hope he wasn't in any pain and that it was just his time.
I'm very sad that Francis has passed away. I'd always looked forward to see Francis and the voice to go with it. Always brightens my day when I get to see him. You will be missed.

Francis will be remembered and missed.

Dear Chef and family, please accept my condolences. I am so sorry for your loss. I have been watching since your first year. Thank you for all your hard work, and for sharing both Francis and wonderful meals with us.
Oh Chef, I'm so heartbroken. Francis was such a good dog, waiting so patiently behind you while you prepared all of those delicious meals.  I know all too well the pain of having a family member pass away, even if they aren't exactly human.  My family and I will be thinking about you tonight, you have all of our condolences.  We will be sad, but understanding, if you decide to no longer shoot these videos; after all, we have so many great videos to look back on from the past 9 years.
My sincere condolences to you guys :(....Francis was the reason I clicked on the subscribe button ( 4 years ago) when I first one of your videos, I thought it was the cutest thing to have him as the host of the show and how you could tell something smells good if he started crying or got anxious when chef was serving up the food. Francis will be missed but never forgotten <3
RIP Francis... You have made my day over the past few years and you will be fondly remembered as the cuddliest host in the world 🐩
RIP Francis dono. Your wise advices will live forever. 🙏
The next host will not be of flesh and bone; but rather felt and wool. Wish you luck.

To be fair, 14 years is quite a long life for a dog that size. May you rest well, Francis.
Also, I was totally expecting some young american to come to the comment section and be like "hey that's not sushi, where's the mango and the cream cheese?"
RIP FRANCIS!!!!
the news at the start of the video honestly made me so sad... we will miss watching you Francis... :'(
no what will happen to the show. Francis was so awesome I'm so sorry. it's hard to lose a pet they're the best life partners

I have no words. Im sorry for your loss.
Rest in peace, Francis. We'll miss you.
Chef, I hope you find comfort with your loved ones. I'm sure this is much more difficult for you than any of us.
So sorry to hear that Francis passed away!!   Sending good thought towards all the Cooking with dog team!!!

Poor Francis!!! We miss you already :'(
Sleep well, pup.
I came here for some happy cooking, left in tears. We will miss you Francis.
my deepest condolences for the chef and family =( Francis will be missed
Two years ago, almost to the day.
I'm crying right now. I loved Francis so much. Chef and the crew from Cooking with Dog please, don't lose hope. We'll be okay. Francis was a happy dog. He was loved and he loved. 頑張ってください。
Francis seems like he was such a sweet, calm, and very well-loved dog. I am sure you both are quite saddened.

My dog is 12 years old and has had cancer for a year. This video really resonated with me as I will likely have to go through this sooner than I would like.

I wish you both the best, and although Francis won't be there, I hope you both will still wish to do cooking videos as I would still love to watch them.
Resquiescat in pace, francis inu-kun
omg, so sad!! I hope he rests in peace.
Francis will be dearly missed :( I'm happy he was so well-loved around the world, and I am sure no matter what direction the channel will go in the future, you have our support!
aaawwwweeeee Francis! I sure will miss you. I will miss seeing you nod off, and get excited when the smells of the kitchen start to tantalize your nostrils.  May you journey well, dear friend.
Good night, sweet Francis, and may angels sing thee to thy rest :(

Had the pleasure of trying oshizushi not long ago in Osaka... Though I am happy to see a recipe for it here, I'm also very sad that this might be the last episode with Francis, if the show decides to continue. Sincere condolences for your loss and may Francis rest in peace.

Francis tried his hardest to be the best host and friend to Chef up until the very end. You can see him trying so hard to be a good dog for Chef! He was a very good boy. The best dog.
I want to praise the team behind Cooking with Dog, they've taught us to become one through food and continuously share with us their love and knowledge. Chef, the editors, Francis (may he rest in peace), and everyone behind the scenes. We love you!
I just remember when my dog passed away. I feel very bad from francis and i hope chef would find peace remember the love they gave each other.
this reminds me of that one megwin video where he used a PSP case to make sushi

２年前に18歳の愛犬が、去年にも同じく18歳のワンコが天国へ旅立ちました。
CWDでフランシスに会えることが、私のささやかな癒しでした。

フランシスとのサヨナラはとても悲しいですが、うちの食いしん坊ワンコ達と、美味しいお料理で楽しく、元気に、天国パーティをしていて欲しいです。
シェフや関係者の皆さまには、どうぞお力落としのございませんように。
I'm sorry for your loss, I can't stop crying
Tears falling at learning of the loss of Francis.  It was always nice watching him in the background as Chef created her fabulous delicacies.  This Oshizushi looks so delicious, I wanted to crawl through my screen to eat it!
Rest in peace,Fransis.We love you,and miss you.noone can be you.
I will miss him, it has been eight years.
I found this channel in high school. I watched for years but when I went to college I became too busy to watch. Wanted to check in again and now I hear Francis has passed a little over a year ago. I am crying, your pain must have been much worse. He lived a long life, hope he's having lots of fun being a chef in doggy heaven <3
I literally cried.
I lost my cat in 2016 as well. I'm really sorry for your loss, I know how it feels. :,(

時間が解決してくれるのを待つのみなのです。頑張ってね
残念。新しい犬を買うつもりですか。
My sister and I were very grieved to hear of Francis' passing.  The idea of an adorable toy poodle hosting a cooking show is what first attracted us to the channel. Over the years we have come to love Francis, Chef, and all their yummy recipes. I'm glad to know that Francis had a long happy life surrounded by all his friends at Cooking with Dog. My sister and I will miss him so much!
I will miss Francis very much. He was such a sweetheart and left a great mark in all of us. I have accompanied you since the very beggining and only today i learned that he had passed away. It makes my heart ache to know that he will not accompany Chef in the backround any more. I feel like this channel has been with me since my adolescence and has watched me grow. From the moment i first started to become acquainted with japanese culture in my youth i have been a fan of this show, and always will be. Remembering the first videos i ever watched and the first recipes i tried to copy I see how much i have changed and how these memories take me back to very clear moments in my life. Thank you for your incredible work inspiring a little bit more of fun and deliciousness into the lives of everyone who had the pleasure of seeing this project grow. Thank you for the deligent work and dedication. Even if i never met Francis (or anyone who makes this show what it is) i feel like we were connected somehow and it pains me to see that he is no longer with us. It leaves a bitter taste of not being able to say goodbye. At least now i take a bit of my time to thank everyone who made this channel possible. Francis will be remembered with much affection and love. Hope you all are doing well and i am very sorry for your loss. Thank you once again. Kisses and love from Brazil.
Nooooooo Francis was the reason for this show to happen!
NOOOOO
I was so shocked knowing this fact... francis.... I am still shock now...

Chef, thank you for leading Francis into our lives, and i thank Francis for being our beloved and adorable host. フランシスが見逃される (i used google translate, its meant to say "Francis will be missed."
NO!!!!! why must 2016 take everything I love ?!?!why?!?!
Francis will forever be in our hearts. Thank you for showing us great dishes and even greater hosting. I understand this may be a hard time for chef and cameraman, so as much as I'd love for your show to continue, I'd completely understand if you need some time off to mourn. I also suggest that you sell t-shirts with Francis on them from your website to celebrate Francis' life and for his fans to show their love and support during this time of mourning. I'd love to wear a Francis t-shirt while I'm trying your recipes so that Francis will be with me and all his fans as we cook. Much love and God bless. We love Francis!!!!

Just yesterday my puppy passed away so I understand completely. I'm so sorry for your loss.
I don't even know what to say but let me extend deepest sympathy to you and your family. The grief process can seem like a roller coaster without light at the end of the tunnel while you get in touch with intense emotions. Francis has touched so many people's hearts across the world and that's a huge accomplishment, let alone for a tiny dog like him. Please know that he now is in a better place and  his legacy will continue in our lives.
😣😣😣😣😣😣😣😢😢😢😢😢 rip Francis

Sorry to hear about Francis. I will miss seeing him.
My heart literally just dropped to my stomach when i seen that holy crap I can't stop crying. 😭😩😩😩
Man cooking with dog has been huge to me. I have issues sleeping and this along with one other YouTube are what help me sleep at night so I can wake up in the morning and keep my job because I have enough rest. Thank you Francis! 😩

Unexpected... Rest in Peace, Francis.

Thank you for letting us know and for the video.
RIP Francis we'll miss you! 😞
Its sad. But that is the curse of being a human. We will always outlive our little fur covered family members. Think of the time together as a journey. Never forgotten. Always loved. Forever missed. The most amazing thing about humans is the ability to grieve. Think of your feelings as a positive thing. It shows how much francis was loved.
RIP francis, you will be missed dearly.
I will miss you Francis. :(
I'm glad that Francis lived a good life, and that you had fun with him.  Keep his silliness in your mind and he will never truly die.
I'm sorry for your loss, Chef.  Sayonara, Francis.
my family dog that my brother and I grew up with passed away a few years ago. she was the best dog we could have asked for and we understand your loss. You have come through so much, may you continue to do so.

I can't help but cry
I've watched your channel ever since you guys started, I was still on my 2nd last year of elementary before entering high school. My older sister introduced me cooking with dog as I was obsessing over Japanese everything. I knew it was coming after watching back a few videos, I just didn't realize how much it made me feel and how much Francis & Chef played a huge part of my life, you helped me grow to be cultured :) Francis was definitely a wonderful dog and will always be there to help cook. RIP Francis
will there be a new host?
NOOOOOOOOO, MY WORST NIGHTMARE HAS COME TRUE.  WHHHHYYY FRANCIS?!
😭
rest in peace francis. D:

I am incredibly sad to hear of Francis' passing and really hope you continue to make videos as I really cherish this channel :(((
I had to take a moment to compose myself to watch the rest of this, I am really sorry for your loss.
I lost both of my chihuahuas this year ( Doofus and Daisy ) and they absolutely loved watching your cooking show with me! They lived for 20 years! I have made many of your recipes and I really really hope you get another " mascot " / " dog " to represent your show! I am not a religious fella by any means but Francis will be happy to see you again someday. So will my little " poopies " because I miss them so much. Thanks for the great recipes Chef and keep doing what you do! :)
oh, francis...
Francis you will be missed😭😭

The happy/contented expression on Chef's face whenever she cooks never fails to make my day. I truly love her and francis. I've been watching this channel for two years and graduated high school- and you have no idea how happy I am to see this channel continuing strong.
I'm so sad to hear about Francis. RIP!!! 😢😢

FRANCIS@!111!!!!!!!!!!
We will miss you Francis.
Now in California we can garnish the sushi with marijuana leaves.
RIP Francise 3
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry for your loss.. But It is important to remember that as long as Francis was happy and had a good life then anything else doesn't matter. Please take care of yourself and its okay if you need some time to mourn over Fracis. We are all here with you!
Now I'm hungry =P
Your show trended on facebook for 3 days, that is the impact of this show and Francis's passing. It is no small feat to trend that long on the worlds largest social media outlet. He will be missed.
You will be missed Francis! Thank you!
such a nice recipe~ i love that bento, i'll have to get myself one. it's a good way to remember francis. i send my condolences to chef a the production team. he left behind a wonderful legacy.
R.I.P. Francis. Cooking shows on YouTube will never be the same again. :(
dear francis, I loved so much and  I'll missing you. rest in peace. kisses from italian friend
IM ALREADY CRYING WHY OMG I CAN'T.
WE'LL MISS YOU FRANCIS :((((
Lots of prayer and love, sent your way!!
Sad to hear about Francis. He was a good companion. I hope you continue to make your videos. I really enjoy them. 🐩🐩🐩🐩🐩🐩 Hugs!
Rest in peace, Francis! I've enjoyed watching you over the years. You were a great companion to Chef, and you will be greatly missed. Take care :(
my condolences, we will miss francis. my family came to love watching francis teach us about cooking too ;) hugs. thank you.. we will continue to support this show forever! arigatou!
I've been watching Cooking With Dog since the Bento Box video and loved every one since. Seeing Francis sit patiently beside Chef as she cooked never failed to put a smile on my face no matter how bad a day I'd had. He was a special little pup and will forever be in a precious part of all of our hearts. I'm sure I'm not the first to say this, and won't be the last, but Francis will be greatly missed and fondly remembered for years to come. 

And, to Chef, I send my condolences. I know how hard it is to lose a pet so dear to your heart. It's like losing a close member of your family. Like your sibling or a child. No words can explain the feeling, and they can't make the pain go away. But I hope all the love that Francis' fans have shared over the years will help ease the heartache over time. You two were the highlights of many peoples' bad days and we only hope that you know how much you both have meant to us. Our thoughts, prayers, and memories are with you and Francis as he watches over you, as I know he is.
I feel like there is no Cooking with Dog without Francis. condolences to chef and the rest of the production
I love you France!!!!!! I will miss you soooooo much!!!!😔😭
R.I.P Francis
Rest in peace Francis :(

Rest in peace Francis 😔😔😢😢

I discovered your channel back in 2009 when I was at University, I was living away from my family as well as my own poodle, so your show was everything I needed to get me through some tough times
Cooking with Dog filled a hole in my heart and I can't thank you all enough.

Really sry for ur lost but cheer up! Cooking with 'the dog' says everything!
Francis, our whole family will miss you! You were such a gracious host, thank you so much for the years of happiness.
Rest in peace Francis :( <3
RIP Francis, you'll be missed! Thank you for all these years.
Francis was such a good dog. Always keeping chef company... You will be missed. Chef I hope you are doing well. Francis will live on in all your videos and our memories :)
I'm crying!! I'll miss him so much, RIP dear Francis. Btw I hope the cooking recipes can continue, I love this channel
Thank you to the whole crew for everything. I really hope you get to keep making videos. Francis is certainly going to be missed - the channel has taught me a lot. Ever since I found their bento box video, I've been making a bento box for work almost every day since. I hope you keep teaching us! We'll miss you, Francis.
Thank you Francis for hosting us for so many years. You will be missed very much. My sympathies to chef and her team.
Rest in peace, Francis! You were loved! To everybody working on this channel, thank you for making these videos. I love watching them with friends, or when I'm feeling particularly depressed or anxious. I hope you find another pup to love and I hope you keep making videos. Thank you so much for all the wonderful content over the years.
I cried... I actually cried. I don't know why it hit me so hard. I've been watching these videos since high school, and now I'm a senior in college. Francis has been here to greet me almost every week with a new cooking video. I saw him aging, but somewhere in my foolish heart, I wished/believed we would have our beloved host forever. Goodbye Francis- may delicious treats from Chef guide you home~ ♥ TT-TT
Oh no!!! I'm so sorry to hear about his passing..he will be missed
Will there be videos after the ones pre-recorded with Francis?
I cried throughout the video rip Francis. At least your in a better place now.
I'm very sorry for your loss. Francis will be missed. My daughter and I love your videos.

RIP Francis.. 😥
Rest in peace Francis

I just heard of Francis' passing from my friend in class a few minutes ago. My deepest condolences go to Chef and the whole crew. Francis was such a lovely dog and he will be greatly missed. Heck, I miss him already and I was almost on the verge of tears earlier! I honestly don't know whether the crew will get another dog to continue Francis' legacy, but if they decide to do so we, the fans, will be cheering you on.
4:09 Delicious! [OMINOUS THUNDER]
This is the Last Video Francis will be in ;-; rip We love you 😭😭🐕❣️
I hope you have all the steak in Doggyland from now on.  RIP Francis - I still make your katsu curry recipe on a monthly basis.  You'll be missed.  My condolences to everyone at Cooking with Dog, it's always hard to loose those close to you, no matter the species - family is family.
Dear Chef, Francis was beloved by all of us.  We could feel your love for Francis, my heart is with you and with Francis forever.  We will miss you Francis!

Oh, my Gooooooood! This looks so savoury and incredible! Anyone tried making it whose cooking skills are equivalent to mine: not completely lost, quite dedicated, but lacking a bit of the natural talent and "instinct"?
This looks extremely delicious, and I can't wait to try this out. Chef is so adorable, gosh. ; v ; Thank you!!
Rest In Peace, Francis. I was so sad to hear the news. What will become of Cooking with dog now?

Rest in Peace Francis. Just found out the news on twitter. :((( He lived a good life

Although I had stopped watching the episodes as much, I found out about this channel several years ago, and it became  my favorite cooking shows on Youtube. Such a fun show. I can understand if Chef does not want to continue it, it wouldn't be the same without Francis.
Vietnamese, Chinese, French, Indonesian, Russian, English and Japanese subtitles are available now. Thank you for the translations. http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?v=SyK0cGIzG7c&ref=share 日本語、英語に加えベトナム語、中国語、フランス語、インドネシア語、ロシア語の字幕に対応しています。 Caption authors: Lưu Thượng Giang (Vietnamese), housi SC (Chinese (Taiwan)), Mayfly (French), Faradella Meilindasari (Indonesian), ダークライト (Russian)

Tears in my eyes by watching Francis still looks well staying next to the chef cooking and wearing the apron that has got his face on in this video... God bless both of you...
big fan love all yours recepits
Garlic fried in olive oil? How Italian. :p I'm going to try and make this recipe tomorrow, I've got some beef ready!
It's really unfortunate that Francis passed away, I just found out and I had only recently found this channel. I loved the concept of the show, it's really cute and I will definitely continue to watch some old episodes. I hope the channel lives on and continues strong. I always get hungry watching the delicious food
Oh Chef, I'm so so sorry for your loss. 
Francis was a great host and a good dog.
I've been following you since I was a teenager, and I'm almost 30 now. 

He will be missed so greatly around the entire world. Please take care of yourself. 
Please know that the world is here for you.
I just tried this recipe, but instead of using beef, i used chicken! It came out lovely! ^-^
RIP Francis<3

Will you change your youtube channel to "Cooking Without Dog" ?
RIP Francis, may you always find good luck in the kitchen.
thats some high quality beef. lots of marbling.
Looks yummy! I'd have to cook mine longer though, I hate undercooked beef (unpopular opinion, I know, but it's how everyone in my family eats meat).
Last video with Francis. R.I.P. :'(

お肉の色がきれい（●＾o＾●）

Judging by that thunder, the gods were pleased with your offering.
So sorry for your loss. Francis was a sweet little friend. Its always hard. But unfortunately it is the curse of being human. We will always outlive our best animal friends... Lots of love from canada.

Dear Chef, I've been with you guys for years... sorry for your loss and may Francis rest in peace.
Still shocked to hear Francis has died... Will this channel continue without him? :(
Oh Francis you want a piece of steak????
Goodbye Francis & rest easy
Rip
RIP Francis :-((((
If Francis was the host of this show, wouldn't the show be called cooking with hooman?
So that was thunder!  Cool!
7年ほど前からのファンです。フランシス君、お疲れ様。いつも、食べ物を前にしても全く欲しがらず大人しくて、本当にお利口さんでしたね。本人（犬）は、こんなに世界中で人気者だとは知らなかったでしょうけれど、あなたはいつも可愛い表情と仕草で、シェフさんのお料理に花を添えてくれました。かけがえのない存在でした。本当に今までありがとう。シェフさんを始め、スタッフの皆様、さぞお辛いとお察しいたします。何も気の利いたことは言えませんが、とにかく、今は動画のことは忘れてゆっくりしてくださいね。（個人的には、このチャンネルは続けて頂ければ嬉しいですが、シェフさんのお気持ち次第だということも理解しています。）フランシス君、今まで本当にありがとう！
Im so sorry about Francis
We love this. We are eating again soon.
This looks winderful chef! I love making steak (and my boyfriend loves when I make it) but in the Netherlands it is not possible to get Japanese style steak with fat marbling, my parents told me that when they were young (1960's) we used to have steak with fat marbling in the Netherlands too but then people started disliking fatty meat because people thought it was unhealthy and now all of our steaks are very lean meat. It is a shame that we cannot try both styles here!

PS: At first I thought the thunder was Francis growling hahaha! Had to replay it to find out it was just the weather :P
Rest in peace Francis T.T
so when are you going to cook the dog?
What mirin should I use? Such a common ingredient. I can find the kikkoman aji mirin stuff in even the worst of stores (Hicksville, Texas).
We love you Francis!!!!🐩🐩 RIP 😢😢
are you gonna eat the dog on the last episode???
Rest in peace, Francis...
IS IT TRUE FRANCIS DIED!?
What kind of steak is that?
皆さん(3人)の動画をいつも見ているのですごく嬉しいです！
Rest in peace, Francis
what happen to Francis?
Solo lo veo por la presentacion y para morirme de hambre , ademas me parece demasiado curioso y genial su pronunciacion del ingles jaja :$
1:28 When I see a spider.
Curious, if there's no mirin in our stores, is there anything we can use to act as a substitute?
The meat needs more cooking👎🏻
Dog died
This made me cry watching him knowing he's in heaven now but he's probably having fun RIP ilysm 🐩
Uh delicious! 🐩🐩🐩 thank you
rest in peace Francis
Good way to use tough round steak.
I like how the channel is "cooking WITH dog" not "cooking with dog for views and having him sleep on the side while I have people focus on my dish"
I thought she was gonna cook the dog!
