Beginning of video: potato???
A few seconds later: oh!!!
I can't make it. I don't have this red glasses...
Hey Ryoya, have you thought about veganizing some region/prefecture-specific and traditional japanese dishes? I would really love to see some!
Peaceful music, beautiful colors... and suddenly 3:49 😂
Me: *doesn't have any of the ingredients
Me: What the heck is lilikoi???


Me: *enjoys watching the entire video nonetheless :)
id like to remake all your recipe, but your ingredients are too expensive for me, so im just gonna eat rice with salt
Oh my God it looks freaking yummy 🤤
その眼鏡懐かしい！また見れて嬉しいです！✧٩(ˊωˋ*)و✧
I have been having a bad day lately, but your video helped me to take time, refocus on my emotions and past actions, and realize what I should do now. You are so inspiring. One day, I hope to become invested in food and cooking the way you are. ありがとうございました　❤️
I love your videos, it is so relaxing to watch you make food with minimal music, also love your glasses haha
I always love your video and see how you cook beautifully. Please keep on making more videos. Cant wait 💕
Your videos are pure ART ❤️
Cooking and film making!
In Spain this is this is called Passion fruit or Maracuya.
Whatever, it look fantastic, it look like a cheesecake but it's absolutely different, I would like to make it
I love the cooking/ingredients pouring and mixing sounds in this video. So good and cinematic food ASMR ❤️👌🏼
真剣な顔でおふざけカマしますよね笑
Please do a video with Avantgarde Vegan 😍, you both can be amazing 💫
I made this today! Well its in the freezer now haha waiting! My first cake :P
I'm so glad to see a new recipe of yours! On the past few years they've become my go-to both for relaxing and learning new vegan possibilities 😊
THE PEEFECT BOYFRIEEND,, KITCHENLY TALKING, HE KNOWS LOTS OF RECIPES AND ALSO DOES WITH LOVE
I HAVD TO TRY IT! It will only never look so beautiful as yours😍
前回はユッカを映して頂いてありがとうございます
元気そうですね
実は少し前からユッカを育て始めましたが、天井に当たる心配をするぐらいになるまでまだまだかかりそうです
Can you maybe mute the blender? Everything is so asmr and nice and peaceful then ERRRRRRRRR! 😅

I really love your videos though and this looks delicious
Those passion fruit are cute <3
This is a beautiful recipe, thank you!
旋律の美しさと映像が映画みたいで素敵です。
Watching your videos really calms me down, thank you for uploading such beautiful videos :) hopefully I can get to try and make even one of your recipes 😌
I think people see how beautiful his videos are and then don’t realise how funny he is. The red goggles? Dying 😂😂
インスタ見てレシピ動画待ち構えてました！やった～観れて嬉しい！
when you're watching peacefully then suddenly that funny glass came off 🤣
Me: what the heck Is a lilikoi? 
Also me after he cuts the fruit: oh
Perfect... Beautiful ...  wowww.   #dgtudo 

SUCCESS, Always!
なぜか沖縄に行きたくなりました。
 ココナッツオイル黄色いですね。白いものしかないとばかり思っていました。
Ommg looks a-mazing!! Thank you for sharing this beautiful Lilikoi cake.♥️♥️♥️
Yay! A new video! Your videos are so peaceful and calming! I love your videos
I have never seen that kind of coconut oil.. I curious if it has a convincing butter taste... 
the video is beautiful as always :)
Piece of art
Thank you for the amazing recipe! I am allergic to cheese and now with your recipe I can finally taste the “cheesecake”! And thank you for filming all these vegan ideas! 

Can I ask what sweetener you are using? Is that honey?
Just put mine in the fridge. So excited 😋
🌀🌀🤣 and a beautiful looking cheesecake.
チーズを使わないチーズケーキってどんな味なんだろう、、食べてみたい‼︎
It would be so great to eventually watch this with your very own cello playing. 🎻
It so elegant and I bet it tastes great. Good job!
This channel is my indulgence.
So beautiful.
3:49 Love that! :-)  And the recipe is awesome, as all of yours! You rock
Is lilikoi known as passion fruit? If so should they not be wrinkly so they're ripe?
I do want a guy like you ><
音楽ありと無し両方観ちゃうんですよね
てかメガネ！！懐かしい(笑)
my parents went on a trip to Hawaii and brought me back TONS of lillikoi....hi chews. still can't make this recipe 😭
regardless of me hating to eat nutty foods, it was still so satisfying to watch these videos. thank you peaceful cuisine for relieving my stress 😊
Me, watching the beginning of the video: what is lilikoi? hmm.... keeps watching Oh, it looks like a very tiny maracuyá. Lilikoi, let me google that real quick. Oh, so it IS passion fruit, I knew it.
Great video and lovely, delicious looking vegan cheese cake. Thank you for sharing your recipe. I will be making this. Your presentation is beautiful.  Domo arigato gozaimasu :-)
Wow..this cake looks beautiful
聞いたことない食材などを使ってくれるので新しい発見ができて面白いです！
Damn your knife looks really cool
like ASMR..
I love your videos. From the cutting of fruits to the blade of your knife through the packaging of your products, everything is aesthetically PERFECT. You are a wizard and I would like to live in your cooking world...
りょうやさん！ビデリシャスのようなノリノリな感じの動画もまた見たいです！
眼鏡のシーンで大爆笑してしまいました。綾也さんのそういうところ好きです。😍
Fridge or freezer? Looks yummy. Thanks 🙏
I like your video, when you cook look easy 👍🏻✨ perfectly
Funny glasses 😂😂😂
Man, I don't even like cheese cake and that looks good
Can we please request a Terrine video? The cashew cheesecake could possibly be a good base for terrine. Love your videos as always. I'm inspired by how organised your kitchen ans storage is! I can't wait to be able to renovate mine one day.
I’ll never make this, but I love watching and pretending I will 💀
i'm still waiting for CHEESE
This is art at its finest 🏅❤
Looks amazing, and the final touch with corn flowers... 😍
For my videos I'm using different kind of music, but I really love the peaceful feeling your choice of music gives as well... maybe I should try to find a nice and calm piano track once, to see how that would work for me ^__^
Oh and btw, I watched all your kitchen building videos, and now I said to my bf that I want something similar, but not sure he is that good with that kind of stuff! 😅
From 6:23 - 6:31 so satisfying...beautiful cake, the corn flowers really add an unique colour to it... nice glasses by the way haha
That ending was fuckin awesome :) Will try this recipe asap, it looks so yummy.
Finally most easiest way to make a cake without an egg and bread! Am enchanted...😍
Can we use any other oil except coconut oil?  And did you play the piano yourself?  That piano music piece was wonderful! 
Thank you for the video🙏
奇抜なメガネかけてもカッコいい…
So artful w/ the blue cornflowers, Ryoya!  awesome vid as usual.  And u didn’t even crack the faintest of smirks at wearing those krazy glasses..!  😆🙏✌️
It looks soo beautiful. Thanky you for making this Cake
ウンパルンパの眼鏡懐かしい😂
久しぶりに見れて嬉しい😂😂🙏🏻
3:49 I was like wait,what???🤣
これは 突っ込んだ方がいいか 迷いますな(-∀-)
見た目も凄く綺麗で美味しそうですね＾＾このピアノいつも落ち着きます♪いつか陵也さんの作った音で癒されたいです♪♫♪
OMG Ryoya, you still have the GLASSES!!😎😎😆😆 Awesome video by the way, looks so delicious.😁💚 Honestly though, I never thought I'd see those glasses again, that you'd lose them when moving to the studio!! 😆
今日のココナッツオイルは黄色ですね
I wonder if it's okay to use the juice from a can
Since i can easily get a lot of passion fruit in my country, can't wait to try this recipe.But i will use butterfly pea flower.Thank you so much for this inspiration recipe.
Who would hv thought to use corn flowers, the colour matches the cake so beautifully
今回も素敵な動画をありがとうございます😊
どのような味がするのでしょう。。⁇
ツヴィリングの包丁もかっこいいですねー✨
ふと思ったのですが、包丁はどのくらいの頻度で研いでいますか⁇
以前包丁を研ぐ動画を投稿されていましたが、手入れだけであれば中砥石、仕上げ砥石だけ使っていますか？？
As I don't own a high-speed blender, would you recommend soaking the cashew nuts as well? :)
I'm here for the satisfying prep sounds. 😚
great video! can you do cashew cheese? tried the other day and i loved. thank you
I have just a question about the recipe : how much maple syrup you add in the  cashew cream ? Thanks
In Poland, you can get corn flower basically for free on any farm. You just go out there and pick up some, because it's thrown away anyway. It's nice to use in tea.
Nice use for that flair plastic tamper ;)
Everybody watching this video now knows sweetener = maple syrup
またようわからん食い物やな果物ね
サプリ動画は出さないの？なんで飲んでるか知りたい！
パッションフルーツ大好きです♡美味しそう(  i꒳i )
サラッとグルグルめがねかわいいでした♡
i love your videos so much💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕ps your very handsome 😊
Looks good, but that Three-k (3 pronged fork) always throws me for a loop
You are amazing. Your video is amazing. Your glasses is amazing. Hi from Russia.
beautiful as always ❤️ thank you
"I want to be a lilikoi, Boy Lilikoi
You grind your claws, you howl, you growl unafraid of Hoi Polloi
You run, you're free, you climb endless trees, you reignite
You growl, you howl, you show your teeth
You bite, it's alright

Just say no more, use your eyes, the world goes and flutters by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are
Use your eyes, the world goes and flutters by
Use your eyes, you'll know you are

Wild beam, wild boy, you burn so bright
'Till you illuminate
One day you're out, you give up the fight
You slow down heart-rate

We all grow old, use your life, the world goes and flutters by..." - Jónsi ❤️
Just wow - really peaceful watching this video  - lights up ones soul
Amazing content as always!
Looks delicious.
I'm just wondering why calling it cheese cake. I don't want to start the vegan vs non vegan debate, but I find that naming convention is one of the main reasons why non vegan sometimes are not even willing to explore other options. Couldn't it just be a "Lilikoi Cake"?
Again, looks delicious :)
Oh man. That light falling on cacao and shining them pure gold like 😍 epic!!

And aah! When the cake liquid is poured over the Almond mix in the pan 🍯
I wonder what can be the Butter flavoured coconut oil replacement if I can’t find one from the stores??
A happy wedding of Lilikoi and Cacao. I also like to combine sour with bitter taste such as strawberry with chocolate.
眼鏡どうした？って思ったらめっちゃふざけてて草
どの国に住まわれてるのか気になります🤔🤔
なにそのめがね？？？
Oooh! Cornflowers! Perfetto! Yet easy, at ease! 💫
Wow this is such a beautiful cake omg
Beautiful video, as usual! I love that you're also not taking yourself too seriously :D
この人の雰囲気凄い好き
In Spain, the most famous cook we have on TV have been doing “the glasses thing” forever.  Look for “gafas Arguiñano” in google. He is a master!! 🤓😎👀
Probably the most healthy and unique cheesecake I've ever seen!
いつか、おじいちゃんになったらカフェを開いてほしい…✨✨✨
おばあちゃんになって、常連客になります☺
Perfect !! ✨
◎⃝⃘ _◎⃝⃘
I miss his Glasses~ It has been a long while~
リリコイってなんぞｗｗｗ果物？？ｗコーンフラワー・・・？トウモロコシの花？(　ﾟдﾟ)ﾎﾟｶｰﾝ
Hello. It's a very comforting video. Thank you. I wonder if nuts are necessary to the flavor - I'm allergic and want to change your beautiful receipt but don't know how lol. Thank you anyway. It's a sight for sore eyes.
lilikoi/passion fruit is delicious!
スタジオツアー希望！
Real title should be:  Passion Fruit Nut Puddin''.
... magnifique 🇫🇷
The glasses had me rolling!
3:48 (( ` ･д･´))！？

不意打ち(笑)
パッションフルーツ★
Don't know what I want more - those red glasses or lilikoi 😂
Watching this high was such an experience
Incredible filming as always epic!
Lilikoi is passion fruit.
綺麗なケーキですね✨
メガネが素敵(*^-^*)
That looks seriously yummy.
Hallo! I think, Lilikoi is Markisa in Indonesia
This is like cooking asmr. I'm into it
He uses the best and coolest equipment - that knife - so solid & sharp - the sound it makes when it cuts anything - art
Imagine having a family and trying to make that 🚫
god i wish that were me
Oh, just make a cheesecake Philadelphia Cream Cheese and be done with it.
I want bread  loaf recipe please
Thumbs up if you thought lilikoi was the flower and not passion fruit
So all this time, Jonsi is actually singing about passion fruit....
Lilikoi teh markisa nya kang, mhun atuh
Ryoya do you think we can replace lilikoi with Mango? :D
Can I ask what kind of coconut oil is this? Mine is pur white.
Perfect!
Therapeutic and at the same time saliva drip inducing
I didn’t know I needed this. 😴
what is sweetener ? thx
ケーキもBGMも繊細で
感動致しました！
🍰ヽ(´▽｀)/💓💞
Waaaa so prettyyy... looks delicious too!
Where do you get your knives from??
へぇ～面白そうなメガネ！
Secret ingredient 👉 red glass 😋
好きですねぇ、そのサングラス🤗
センスが半端ない😊
Did u know coconut oil is high in saturated fat! It will increase ur cholesterol
いつも素敵な動画で癒されてます。。。メガネ！！笑
美味しそう！食べてみたい!
「チーズケーキって随分シンプルなの作るんだなぁ…」って思ったんですけど、りょうやさんveganだったの忘れたました。リリコイってチーズっぽい風味が出るのかな〜。。
初期の頃にかけていらっしゃったメガネ姿がまた見れて、うれしいです！　I'm very glad to see you wearing red glasses like the early days!
どうしてこんなに固まっているのですか？
普段表情があまりないので、怖い印象を持ってましたが、ユニークな方なんですね😌
beautiful.
見た目も素敵で美味しそう❣️
ちょいと  お茶目な所出すあたり👍
笑えましたよ
いつ見ても  料理もさることながら
出来栄えに脱帽です
センスって持ってるものですよね
私には無いなー🤣
Algún hispanohablante?

Soy el único que le llama a esa fruta granada de moco?
メガネ可愛い〜(◎v◎)

後ろに写ってる冷蔵庫のタイマーも２つ並んでお目目みたいですね(◎v◎)

いや…綾也さんならワザとやってそうやな…笑
3:49 - Nice glasses
トケイソウだ！
This is a no-bake? What thickens it?  Just the cashew 'cream'?  Nothing like agar-agar or something needed?  Thx.
Those GOGGLES!
はい、お口あ～ん♪
サングラス素敵ですね( * ॑˘ ॑*  ) ⁾⁾
Nice knife ;D
Beautiful! <3
is like a tiny passion fruit!! how cute?? does it taste acid and full of vit c too?
Hahaha. Those glasses 🌀🌀
Wow 👍💞💕💞
He is soooo weird and creative in the same time.
見たことないフルーツ。どんな味なんだろう😋
ホントだ(笑)
コメント読んでたけど、メガネ姿登場で笑ってしまいました😂
何事もないように作ってるのがまた面白い（˶′◡‵˶）
あれは前見えてるんですか？笑
Aawww the weird eyewear is back!
#veganasmr
カカオとメンマの味噌汁呑みたいな
Where did you get the red glasses? So cool!!😆
Perfect... :)
こんにちは
素敵な動画ですね。
使用しているナイフのメーカーを教えてくれませんか？
Uploaded last then a hour ago and already three dislikes. Now thats what you call dedication.
these videos are bliss ☺️
What kind of sweetener is that:?
veganじゃなくても食べたいと思いました。これからも動画投稿を頑張ってください！
Bisa di coba nih menu buka puasa...
Masterpiece!
amazing💜
It looks so pretty!
😭😭😭😭😭it looks delicious
それでは聞いてください
「いやリリコイなんか地域的に売ってねえよバカ(切実)」
I love your Channel !
Thank you. Just thank you.
そのメガネ、りょうやさんしか似合わないwww
Heyyyy.... that looks delicious
this guy's dessert is my salary
Those glasses were not peaceful..........
what happened to ur eye?
i like your glasses haha
なんだ天才か
この人ってとんでもない金持ちかなにかですか？
LOVE IT
🙏👍
Do I have toput it in the fridge or freezer? Have it in the fridge now for 4h but it‘s still liquid. ;(
I mean... How can a cheesecake feel so healthy?
Good video
Do you use bonsai scissors?
I love your videos! I am definitely making this! Lilikoi are hard to come by this time of year though. I wonder if I could replace it with a different juice? Maybe a rasberry juice, to keep the tartness. Fingers crossed!
ぐるぐるめがねの残像が消え無い。
お〜〜、とっても美味しそう！
インスタで見て
紫の花は、何かな？と思っていました
コーンフラワーと言うことは
まさか、トウモロコシの花ですか？
グルグル眼鏡、お久しゅうございます！
楽しく見させていただきました〜
In indonesia called markisa
Beautiful
WOOOOOW - Cheesecake is my favourite :)  need to film one on my channel sooooon!
This is a poem!
🖤
🤩
Markisah? 😯🤔
🍥-🍥
How big is your tart pan? How many inches?
It.looks.beautiful.
Never see those fruit before
Don't marry her have me...
りょうやさんへ
是非とも同じ材料で作りたいんですが、私、ココナッツが食べられないんです。ココナッツオイルやココナッツフレークに代わる材料ってありますか？
まじ天才やな
where is the cheese xD
💖
Send it to me🍴
Markisa
I've only ever been able to realistically make a handful of your recipes, but I'll always come back to watch and dream... lol
Could you upload this video without background music please? Everything is perfect but I think the music is kinda distracted!
Is that markisa?
Are you Willy Wonka?
Wow, this is going to be a favourite! The simplicity of the colours is just stunning 🤩  What kind of coconut oil did you use? The oil has a very yellowish colour...
🌱
Must try
I love the color on the cake
Peace
Yehehehe boi
V:)
The other language in the heading is Japanese or Chinese ??
Que bonito cake!
what size is the cake tin you used?
Wow 😲 Wow 😮 Wow 😯
久々のお菓子動画！観てて惚れ惚れします😊❤️

コーンフラワーって、とうもろこしの花てことですか⁇
私が知ってるコーンフラワーは黄色粉でした🌽🌽🌽

どんな味するのかしら⁇😆
Will it tastes the same if I replace especha by ground weed? Asking for my friends.
Those decorative things on the cake look like paper cranes
Are you wearing eye strength glasses in the video
Your table/lens seems to be tilted to right in this one.
Can I use passion fruit instead
I literally thought omg cheesecake with mosquitos?
Could you calm down with the filters a little?
oh, lilikoi is passionfruit. i was wondering what the heck that was. looks good.
I don't even cook
But your videos are too aesthetically pleasing to resist
omg your glasses caught me off-guard! hahaha xD
Those blue flowers add so much aesthetic value to that piece, damn.
He protec
He attacc
He's bacc to make you a snacc
I always watch your no music cooking with my mother because it's really soothing and relaxing.
THIS VIDEO MADE ME CLEAN MY ROOM AND NOT TALK BACK TO MY MOM . 

Bootiful !
when he sprinkled those corn flowers, i went "this guy gonna keep his live as aesthetics as he can" X'D
Ryoya ought to be a Canadian with all the maple syrup he's using 😂😂😂
I've never seen a butter flavoured coconut oil where I live. Sounds perfect for baking!
I think the point of this channel is that you can be a vegan while still enjoy good food and life. And I think Ryoya san has done a perfect job!
i swear that i clicked on the video thinking those were mosquitoes lmao
Very relaxing to watch 😌 looks delicious in the thumbnail 😋
You forgot to write two ingredients, I think it might have been lemon juice and maple syrup. Confirm?
He's back at it again with the glasses lol.
3:46 the man, the myth, the legend!
if you put ASMR in the title instead of NO MUSIC you would get a looot more views i think
I would love to see a collab with Junskitchen. You’re both very talented.
Love your glasses, man. Also, great vid as always.👏
That looks delicious!  Another great recipe and video!  Had to laugh when I saw the Rezz glasses but that was a cool touch!
He protecc 
He like to bacc 
But most importantly
His goggles are wacc
I could just feel my allergic reaction to almonds when they popped up
Não conhecia esse tipo de maracujá, essa receita é perfeita tentarei fazer o mais rápido possível 😀
There's nothing more relaxing than a Peaceful Cuisine video! With the right dose of sense of humor! 

You've been such an inspiration for starting my own channel! 
👏👏👏👏👏😍
Just wondering two things:

1st: It is the coconut oil/butter what makes the consistency of the cream cheese, rigth?

2nd: Those knifes, are they Damasco's steel??
I won't ever make this,but i had to stop was i was doing and watch your video.
Just can't resist to your way of video making!
coconut oil BUTTER flavor!?? what kind of atrocity is this??
yum! i would have included the passionfruit seeds in for some crunch tho!
Very classy 👌
But what makes the filling stick together ? I appreciate your help
I don't know why when I first looked at the thumbnail I thought those things on top were mosquitoes 😂
Love cheesecake. Love lilikoi even more. Put them together? Flavor explosion.
The corn flowers looked like mosquitoes in the thumbnail, istg
Your cooking videos are the most beautiful in all of YouTube. Thank you!
One thing I am wondering every time I watch one of your videos: how do you measure ingredients? In the video it seems as if you poured them directly from the package into the blender without some sort of measuring. Is there a trick behind the scenes? :)
did you steal Elton John's glasses?? 


amazing video
Is it just me but I always find that cooking videos from Japan are always no music and aesthetically pleasing?
I swear your videos feel like an actual movie cut into little pieces. Outstanding quality.
OMG that crust!!! I'd literally eat it with a spoon straight from the food processor! I can taste the crunchy-choco almond and coconut 🤤
I'm going to make this crust combination, just for eating it as it is! Brilliant!
seeing those glasses were so shocking in the most peaceful way
For me this channel is a masterpiece of ASMR, without even calling it ASMR :D I especially enjoy no musics, but in general. Thank you, great job!
Why your videos are you soo peaceful?
always makes me sleepy whenever watch stuffs like this
Omg love passion fruit (it's passion fruit right? Unless it's really another type of fruit that looks too similar) and I love cheesecake and I'm vegan so this is absolutely perfect. I'm definitely making this!!!
Ah! it is corn flower from the cover it looks like mosquito or some sort of dead insects
Anything I can use to replace the cashews? Almonds are ok, I can't eat nuts with aflatoxins like cashews, brazil nuts, etc
Why did you muted the color on the thumbnail... i makes your delicious cake look like one of this sticky moth trap ....
4:43 How did you know that the cocoa powder was 30g?
4:43 How did you know that the cocoa powder was 30g?
リリコイとはなんぞやー？
パッションフルーツか
食べたことないので味の想像ができないけど
絶対うまそう！！
Are passionfruits all that small? I’ve never seen a passionfruit in relation to other objects before
Glad you're back, take your time and enjoy cooking! Love these videos so much.
when i saw that corn flower at preview picture, i think "is that a mosquito?" :D
I thought the cake had ants on it in the thumbnail I’m sorry I-
I missed your videos!!! 😭
And damn are you a man with fine taste and aesthetics. Haha
The cashew nuts are raw? Do I have to soak them in water before? Im new to vegan cooking. Thank you
真剣にみてたんですよ！みてたんですけど、、、め、眼鏡に気を取られてしまって、ついつい笑ってしまいました✨👍😂💓
in the thumbnail i thought the cake has some dead flies and mosquitoes
Those glasses 😂😂 I love this! Definitely wanna try it out now
aint gonna lie this is ASMR good shit
watching you put corn flowers on the top of the cake was a stressful experience... =))
Who else think the thumbnails looks like a cheese with dead mosquitos? 🤔
I thought it was dead bugs on the thumbnail lol
Cornflower (Centaurea cyanus) is the national flower of Germany. It never occurred to me that it was edible. Last week I tried to make some home-made, cold-pressed virgin coconut oil and it turned out good. Flavouring it might be a next venture.

Thank you for this lovely recipe!
I had a genuine wtf moment when he popped the cake out of the pan
A new fresh video again, thanks Peaceful Cuisine! ❤️ Every one of your vids are fascinating! You deserve a love. cool shades btw
Look's so yum, love the Peaceful Cuisine vids, their the best !!
Mede us smiled also! hahaha! ( ◠‿◠ )
whats crazy is that this man just made a vegan CHEESE cake
I really enjoyed this video!! It was very peaceful, thank you for these kind of videos.
8:45 reminded me of the movie "Brave "  spell cake scene. 
Merida , what was in the cake?!
All your videos are so beautiful! Sending you love from Russia💜💜💜
asmr to the highest level (earphone) and that unusual bold red glasses tho XD
白黒のサムネ、、、びっくりした、、、
羽虫に見えたよ、、、
Carai lilikoi é maracujá em qual língua??
手際が良くて見てて飽きない！！！
Oh it's here :)) nevermind me! San-kyu
I thought the toppings is mosquitoes
Tasty producers at Buzzfeed are quaking. This is so satisfying 😌
woah! didn't expect those shades!
Lovely and relaxing 💛
The glasses gave me a big smile 😁 Thank you for what you do !
Took me a minute. Was wondering why this guy made a mosquito pie.
I burst out laughing when I saw those glasses omg
When I looked at the thumbnail I thought it was mosquitos
I THOUGHT THEY WERE MOSQUITOES.
Oh. I love you sun glass. HaHa :D
i felt like i'm watching movie though
I thought that was a dead mosquito 😐
I wish this guy glasses would glow like from Anime
I’ve never supported anyone through Patreon...but I would support YOU if it meant we could get more of these beautiful videos. 😊❤️
I literally thought those were bugs on the cheesecake lmao
Who else here thought they got mosquitos on the cake in the thumbnail?
Looks phenomenally delicious ❤️👨🏾‍🍳😍
Perfect thing to relax me before bed! ❤️
The cornflower actually looks like bugs ._.
About how many lilikoi did you use to get to 120g juice?
at first i think a flower is a mosquito lol
何だかロマンチックな色のケーキですね｡
綺麗(*´∀`*)
Cheesecake without real cheese 👍
In thumbnail flowers looks like dead mosquitos :p
i thought those flowers were called lilikoi lmao now i see it's actually the passionfruit
Hahaha oh my the glasses were a nice addition 😁😍😎💓
I freak out when I saw your Damascus blade knife. Would love to see your whole equipment!
I like your glasses 
I like passion fruit maybe I will try it
Thanks ❤️
Your use of maple syrup gives me comfort at this point :)
Yo it feels like meditating while watching this video 😂😂
Why does it looks like flys on your cake?
最初、上に乗ってるコーンフラワーが虫に見えてびっくりした
the crust looks like a cork💀💀
what a beautiful dessert. Lilikois are so delicious and I love eating them in the morning!
Lilikoi sure as hell look a lot like a passionf.. oh
One of the best youtube channel ever!
Tiap aku mau masak kyk abang mamak aku selalu ngomel. “Masak aer aja gosong, macam2 mau buat kue macam gitu”. 
Nanti deh Bang aku praktekin kl udh punya dapur sendiri. 
Makasi videonya ya Bang. Sukses terus. Salam dari daratan +62
I MISSED YOU :-(
I have tried some of your recipes!   So simple, vegan and turns out delicious always.  Thank you Ryoya. 😊
That's so damn healthy I wanna try it
What did you do with the passion fruit seeds? I love passion fruits and I remember they are incredibly expensive in Japan.
Are the shades a mandatory ingredient?
I couldn't click fast enough ♥️♥️♥️
If you look up 'perfection' in the dictionary, there's a link to this video.
I knew corn flour never heard about corn flower...lolz
Your videos are so peaceful!
サムネ　コーンフラワーが羽虫に見えたのは俺だけじゃないはずww
AMSR so good I heard your tummy rumble.
Everything you make looks so delicious, but I can't eat any of it because you use so many ingredients that I'm DEATHLY allergic to.  In this one: Coconut and almonds.  Even smelling coconut oil can start me wheezing.
上に乗ってるの、蚊に見えたのわたしだけ？
passionfruit is so underrated
コーンフラワーか…最近海外で虫食流行ってるから…びっくりした…！
In Spain, the most famous cook we have on TV have been doing “the glasses thing” forever.  Look for “gafas Arguiñano” in google. He is a master!! 🤓😎👀
I love your videos. From the cutting of fruits to the blade of your knife without forgetting the packaging of your products, everything is aesthetically PERFECT. You are a wizard, would like to live in your cooking world ...
This is the most beautiful Cheese Cake I've seen in my life.
You can't go wrong with a cake.. Never tried this one, can't wait to make one.. Great  video and editing by the way....
Many want to see a review video for that pair of red eyewear 👓
this looks aamazing thank you, my suggestion would be to blanche the almonds and peel them. everything else I ll follow when I get the chance
Random pour in = 30 gram lol
I always love how the sounds in your videos are so crisp/dry. On some of the other channels I watch, they keep showcasing that weird sticky sound that happens when stirring viscous wet ingredients and it makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit every time, so I really appreciate your audio
That's a nice glasses you got there👍
I don't know why , but your videos always make me tear up,  they have a certain sensitivity to them . Never have I thought I would be crying at silent cooking videos tho😥
sorry but no bake cheesecake are not real cheesecake. they taste disgusting.
no music is even better -
I love one (1) man
ふわぁ〜っと♡パッションフルーツの🥭いい香りがした気がしました＾＾
So yummy))) I love your youtube channel!!!! 💜💜💜💜
I love that you've separated the yummy juice from those terrible tasting seeds. Passionfruit is so very delicious without the obstruction of the seeds. I think we need to see you enjoying unctuous bites of your creations at the end. It would be so much more satisfying. 🤗🌈☀️
avoiding youtube drama, sup
omg I can't stop laughing at the fact that he looks so much like my high school biology teacher after all this time lmao
The glasses are back! 🤗 & the giant bottle of maple syrup! So many good things in this video! 🙌 I was surprised that the crust didn’t have dates, but still seemed to hold up well! 👍👍
your passion fruits are very tiny and cuteeeee
those classy glasses!
チーズ…？
I just realized I don't enjoy the sound of scraping. Had to mute the beginning of the video. In other news though this came out looking delicious!
this cheese cake, dont have cheese?
Amazing as usual 👏👏❤
Scraping a spoon on a sive is  on the boderline of satisfying to hear and nails scraping a chalkboard
Am i the only one who taught the topings on the thumbnail is mosquito?😁😁
How long does it takes you to complete the recording Sir? You are my true inspiration. I’m just speechless by the style of how you record the recipe . Each ingredient are the character of the recipe and I love how you create a whole drama out of those character ... classic . Hats off Sir
Looks beautiful and delicious!! 😍
Where's the hell cheese dude?...I not even see a cheese
Your work is so esthetic, your culinary arts very fine! A little bit magic remaind in last kitchen? Whats wrong?
Love the recipe but I can’t eat coconut products (yes my life sucks) any tips on a substitute?
Damn he just made a cheesecake without the cheese 😂
こんばんは。
リリコイって何だろうと思って動画を見始めたら、パッションフルーツの事だったんですね！
パッションフルーツはさっぱりしているので濃厚なチーズ風フィリングと相性が良さそうですね。
Your knife is so beautiful!!
The glasses really brought the whole thing together
I can't get over the glasses. XD
Odd choice topping a cheesecake with dead flies.
めっちゃ美味しそう( o̴̶̷᷄ ·̫ o̴̶̷̥᷅ )
What a lovely cheesecake and your red eyeglasses is so weird 😂✌
Where did you get that Damascus steel knife? It was beautiful and looked easy to handle.
relaxing as usual
I want a slice. Lol
LOVE IT DO MUCH!
ナッツやパッションフルーツ使ってチーズっぽさの演出かぁ！
味見したい✨
Those goggles at 3:51 made my day😂😂
Those 'dizzy glasses' though :D Love it! Absolutely beautiful cake and so unique without being tacky <3
So peaceful...i am going to try to make them this weekend.
I love your vídeos :)♥
これでチーズケーキっぽくなるのが想像つかない！！
食べてみたい😆❤
どんな味なのかな〜
Can I just take this man n keep safe in my pocket ... He is awesome
SO SATISFYING
That's just lovely!!!
Can you make a vegan chocolate cake? :D
Great video.
As always.
I'm so hungry now.
途中の眼鏡に意識が持ってかれた
wwwwwwwwww
サムネが良くない
Very Very beautiful. Passion fruit works so great in custards and chocolate. Really nice. Can't wait to make my own. Thanks for the inspiration!!
Looks delicious and beautiful 😍
I didnt know corn flower has such beautiful color!
3:53 it can’t be a Japanese video without something random happening
Your thumbnail like some insect
Am I the only who never saw fruit looking like that? What even is this ?
How come you have always a new jar of coconut oil to use ?? 😛 Do u use so much of coconut oil ?
I thought the corn flower was dead mosquitos
I thought it was some mosquitoes 😂😂
外人にも日本人にも親切！！
No one gona mention those glasses? haha
3:50 ジェラードンの西本かい！
I missed seeing you in the videos :D
Very relaxing thank you
really interesting recipe! I'd love to taste this

it seems to me that soaking almonds for 8 hours and then using dessicated coconut kind of cancel each other out in terms of water content though, especially since they're being blended anyway.  I bet you could simply use regular almonds and fresh coconut (or almonds, dessicated coconut, and like a tablespoon of water)
Yay you're back!!!!!
i wanted to follow some of your recipes but some ingredients are so hard to find in my country 😩
나만 썸네일 데코 벌레들 죽은걸로 보였나.
looks soooo good  .... The glasses are a hit :)
This is amazing! I also love how most (if not all?) your recipes are vegan 🌞
The glasses are back!!!
途中、べんぞうさん出てきた😂
コーンフラワーは切り分けた後にちょんとのせるのがよさげ(　ﾟдﾟ)/
i bet butter-flavored coconut oil is gross
this is my stress reliever lol
But ... where’s the cheese?
Lilikoi - Passion fruit
Can you use half the sweetener?
For a second on the thumbnail I actually thought those were squashed mosquitoes on the cake
Always the best.
Let's face it, those glasses are awesome.
I thought those mosquitoes on top of the cheese cake😂
This is pure ASMR!
*makes the crust and eats it with a spoon*
I thought that the cake use insect as topping
썸넬... 나만 케이크 위에 모기잔뜩으로 보이나..... ㅠㅠㅠ
your glasses made me laugh so hard
I wasn't prepared that this would not go to the oven. I think I'll have to try this.
Love this
虫かと思ったわ
Is the flower edible?
That eyeglass tho 🤣
i love the glasses tho
i thought the topping is mosquitoes
lilikoi

Love the glasses!
Me 3:51 😎
what was that you were wearing, those glasses
In Indonesia known as Marquisa
This is so relaxing
Passionfruit, the smell is so nice, the taste .. well when its in my mouth , it taste like sulfur and i have that for at least two days.:/ Any other idea of fruit juice?.
I thought that was a potato.
So it's cheesecake without cheese?
❤️
Why that coconut oil is pale yellow in color?
I wonder what it tastes like.
The Sound  1:221:221:221:221:22
the goggles are great
no cheese, cheese cake?
👍👍👍🌷
💙💙💙
THE GLASSES!
Hello!why your coconut oil is yellow?
3:44 😄
aaa i want a bite of it
💞💞💕
I love you.
who else thought there were dead flys on top of the cake in the thumbnail?
music to my ears
You make it look so easy...
So beautiful. I wish I had a high speed blender so I could try it.
Your glasses made me smile 😄
i thought the toppings were dead mosquitoes
I love your shades 3:51 ❤❤❤
I like his glasses
🇾🇪🌷🙋🏼
🖤
Mosquitoes cheesecake
I'm so used to liquid coconut oil, I always get surprised when I see it in solid form!
Why no music ? 
Sounds a bit strange watched with volume  down .
I'm in love with this
yo i thought those were mosquitoes in the thumbnail
ぐるぐるめがね
Best asmar ever
Hmm yummy... 👍😋
Does anybody else see mosquitos on the cheesecake in the thumbnail??
What is lilikoi ?
BEAUTIFUL
This seems like it would take awful, but it’s pretty!
No music for me
Look a like mosquito
gotta say, you cant really call it cheese cake. maybe passion fruit and almond cake, but not cheesecake.
驚くばかり
🌴🍉
Valiryan steel
Awesome 🍀🙏🏼👍🏼
りょうやさん！
ハートくださーい！
Really bad cover
First time seeing those fruits
HE BACC!!
good knife but needs to be sharpen a bit
What is that tiny passion fruit?! I've never seen it before 😕😕
🍽Delicious
cheeeeeesecaaaaaaake
Nice
nice shades
毎回料理の意識が高過ぎてがぶ飲みメロンソーダレベルの意識の低い自分じゃ味のイメージがつかねえ
why you didn't remove the bottom of the cake mold? won't it ruin your knife and mold by cutting into it?
Organic Maple syrup is a trap dude beware
Cheaper than Valium!
Lilikoi = passion fruit
I thought those were potatoes at first.
I am allergic to cashew nuts, could I use almonds in the filling instead? Would the consistancy still be the same?
Lilikoi/passionfruit is like the same thing as maracujá??
Is lilikoi and passion fruit is the same kind?
Clickbait  😂🤣
Ear porn
I thought it was a passionfruit...
What’s Lilikoi and why do I want to eat the cheesecake?
I thought it said "Lililoki"....i just woke up okay XD
first one!
Yesssss!!!!!
Where is the cheese? Nice video btw 😊
This had 4,200 views and 420 likes at the time of my viewing.
Ayy welcome back !~
Cheesecake w/o cheese??
3:47 me making fake barf to make my mom call in sick in third grade
beautiful <3
passionfruit is a much more common name than lilikoi. you'd probably get more views with passionfruit in the video title.
How is it cheese cake when it doesn't have cheese?
I'm a simple vegan, I see amazing food and novelty glasses? I hit the like and comment buttons. =^D
cannot locate the cheese
2:07 - 2:11 EEK STOP WATCHING ME PEE
Can you make a video explaining why you choose to be a vegan/ why you only make vegan food?
What got me was the pic in thumbnail looks like dead mosquiotes tart.
The discipline this man has is amazing.
He wakes up early, works out in the morning, eats this healthily and keeps his home clean and organized
Please make video where you explain why you take suplements!!
My man here gonna live a hundred years...👊👊👏👏
2 kitchens ? Home Tour maybe? :o
Who else gets fascinated by every random thing this man does? 😳😍 He does everything so perfectly! 🤣
"It smells like... Asia" 😂
When I saw the bananas I thought he'd say he eats 40 bananas a day
He probably makes his own toothpaste, too.
How much money do you spend on food, in a month?
PS: I am really interested in the suplements, I already use a few of them as well.
I completely know the feeling when you make gluten-free or whole grain pasta, add a load of veggies and try to skip the cheese. It tastes amazing while adding no guilt, but if it goes cold before you finish it, 'Pasta Hell' doesn't quite cover it. 😅😂

Really nice video, Ryoya-san! I'm an Indian vegetarian, but your videos have inspired me to try my hand at vegan living as well.😄
Your whole life is aesthetically pleasing. I love your videos they're so calm and bring me peace. Thank you
Ryo-san: I go to the gym at 7 am after breakfast. 

Me: hates myself
Is it just me or a lesser known fact that almond milk's just almonds and water? That's as clean as clean can be❤️
Love this!!! Also if you speak English like me turn on captions (they are in English)😘
You always make such calming videos, no matter what, and I love it. 😍
This is the kind of life I want to lead some day. You are so inspiring. Thanks for these videos.
Almost 2M subscribers! Go Ryoya Go!
Your home is beautiful, tidy and neat. Such a comfort place! Really interest in supplement video and pls film more vegan recipe as it such a joy to watch your videos😊 and also an inspiration of simply life style👍🏻

Thank you for the video, please make a video describing why you take those supplements. I think ti would be fascinating to learn why.  Any snacks during the day? How many calories in total do you think you had today? You're great by the way!
lol the way he says and it tastes awful when it (pasta) cools down
New Kitchenツアーが早く見たいです～～
I actually having this every day until I realize that cooking oatmeal in the rice cooker makes it even more creamier without milk or cream (don’t add milk cause the rice cooker will explode unless you have a stable temperature rice cooker) less time consuming and very delicious. you can let it cook till you home; here is my recipe:

1 cup rolled oats 
2 cup water 
A pinch of salt 
1 tbs chia seed
3 tbs brown sugar 
The rice cooker will cook each oats so that the texture will become very smooth and creamy
りょうやさんお久しぶりです😊😊
りょうやさんちって普段用と撮影用とキッチンや冷蔵庫が2つあるのですか？👀

i wanted to try and actually eat healthy for once but im a broke university kid and street food , canned goods, and fast food is the only option for me. 

watching this gives me inspiration for when i get a job and live alone though
I'd be interested in why you take the supplements! Great video as always :)

Hello from California USA  i LOVE your videos bro ! You need to post more and your home 🏠 so beautiful and simple
サプリ動画楽しみにしています！
洗剤とかもiherbで購入されていますか？

動画とは関係なくて申し訳ございませが、ryoyaさんがされている腕時計はどこのメーカーのものでしょうか？
Ryoyaさんの影響で朝食をオートミールにして1年以上経ちます。豆乳とフルーツとナッツが定番です。
見ててひとつ気になったのは、既製のアーモンドミルクがあるのにブレンダーでアーモンドミルクを作ってるところ。そのほうが食感がおいしいからでしょうか。それともアーモンドが残っててたまたま、かな。
サプリメント動画も楽しみにしてます。
my goodness that kitchen is GOALS
That almond milks looks LUXURIOUS! Wow!
油揚げと菜の花のパスタ、いいですね。お昼ごはんに真似します。
キッチンの全体像が見られて、楽しかったです。カウンターに並ぶ調理器具とエスプレッソマシンが、以前のキッチン以上に映えてて、素敵です。
サプリメント動画も見たいです。よろしくお願いします！
MSM... Sound like the one for bones and joint. Usually comes with condroitin.
サプリメントも興味ありますがルームツアーもして欲しいです！
your consistency to eat healthy is amazing. Do make a video on how taking these supplement helps you?
Was about to ask if you stop taking MSM because i watched an old video of you and you took MSM pills almost every meals (?)

サプリの言及が動画近日公開の予告みたいになっちゃってて、みんな期待値が大ですね！
私は是非キッチンやリビングツアーをやっていただいたいです(^｡^)
[English Translation Below]

あんまり動画見なかったけど、なんか日本語のアクセントがちょっと違うって感じ?外国人がうまそうに日本語を喋ってると聞こえる。
でも、いつものように、動画おつかれ!楽しかった。

I haven't seen a lot of your videos, but somehow your Japanese accent sounds a little off. It almost sounds like a foreigner speaking Japanese really well. But still, as always, great video!
Why don't you add flax/chia/hemp seeds to your porridge?
It smells like...... Asia
-Peaceful san 2019
This video is such a treat- thanks for making it! It's so cool to see how you make your own meals as well as your space! Thanks! 😍🤗🤩

Yes please, make the video.💙
Please ryoya-senpai tell us all about those supplements 💊
Please explain your choice of supplements....
Heyy, just saw your video and wanted to share this side note with you; bentonite has the character of binding like a sponge on himself ~ that's good for toxins in the body get rid of them. But if you're taking that together with the other vits, minerals etc then you lose most of the good Effekt of both sides. 
If you knew already, the info is for others :))
Thx for this sharing. Greetings
I really love the aesthetic of this video. I hope one day can I live how I want.
hey i think you should do something about that rocking cutting board
サプリメントの動画、めちゃくちゃみたいです！！！
I just realized THATS why there's a hole on the lids for pots and pans 😮😮😮 to drain water!!!!
Also that tofu looked amazing
It's awesome that you like peruvian coffee,    the one in chanchamayo region is very good too.
前の減量？中の動画より、ちゃんとお腹にたまる様な食事してるんですね👏笑

ビーガンでは無いけれど、綾也さんのレシピで手打ちでラーメン作りました🤤❤️
美味しかったですー！(テンペは手に入りませんでしたが…)

実際作ると、日頃どれだけ野菜不足か痛感しますね。

そう言えば、ピーナッツ柄のお皿良くでませんか？お家での食事だとちょうど良いサイズで使いやすいのかな😁笑

With so much curiosity going on down below, Ryo-san will HAVE to make a video on his supplement intake now hehe! Btw did I mention I am in love with your state-of-the-art kitchen?

Wow Ryoya-san, have you studied flower arrangement? The flowers in your kitchen are very well done. You have great taste!
Thank you for that tip with the lentil pasta!!! I could never bring myself to eat it no matter how healthy, because i couldn’t stand the texture. This helps a lot! :-)
Why do u have 2 separate sources of water? The water used for the paster boiling was different from tap?
Please make a video why you take those supplements.
sensei, are you vegan?
Someone is a cutie 😍🔥
Everything you cook looks delicious!! & i love it bcuz is vegan...  Yumm

Please make a supplements video! I enjoy videos like this very much, so thank you for the time you put into them!
Do you take any B12 supplements? If not, you should consider taking them! It's very important on a plant based diet.
All the best!

why did I just realize he’s vegan
why did I just realize he’s vegan
Yessss video on your supplements plssssss
Seriously... all it takes is blending almonds and water to make almond milk?

I thought it was a bigger process lol.
Yess, please make a video about supplements!
I'd be interested in your choice of suppliments and how you came to choose that particular protein powder. Thanks!
Thanks for sharing. What do you eat when you go out? I also use the same protein, do you just mix it with water or do you also add almond milk and fruits to your drink (ie. smoothie)?
So jealous, healthy stuff is expensive when you live with 5 people in a family :^( 


Nonetheless, wonderful video!
I would love to see a supplement video and the benefits!
No B12  supplement??

Please make the supplements video!!

OMG finally !!!!!
Plz make a video on the supplements👍💚
I love these videos where you talk us through your routine and show us what your daily life is like! I love your recipe videos so much, but there's just something really personal and fun about you casually making conversation and talking while you cook. Hopefully someday I'll be able to wake up at 5 AM, make a gorgeous breakfast, and hit the gym lmao
サプリメントの動画みたいです！
兄がなぜビーガンになったかのビデオを撮る？ そしてどのようにビーガニズムをたどるのですか？ お願いします。

It's funny) 
I sit and eat perfect Carbonara with Serbian ham and bacon, milky cream and eggs and watch a vegan table!) But I really love your videos!
Yes! Please make a video on your supplements
サプリ動画是非ともお願い致します。気になります❗️
Could you make the video please?
Please do make a video on your supplements, I am curious as to why u choose to take bentonite and activated charcoal together with other supplements. Both bentonite and activated charcoal are adsorbents (which is why they are marketed as 'detox supplements'), but the thing is they don't target specifically for the bad stuff like 'toxins' but they adsorb anything that is within your gastrointestinal system at that time, and prevents them from being absorbed into the body by excreting through the feces. This is the reason why it is advised to take these products 2 hours apart from any other medications and supplements, and honestly taking them long-term is also a concern if u were to take them close to your meals as they may also reduce the absorption of important nutrients from your meals. I hope that u will make this clear to your audience as it is very important that they do not mix these 'supplements' with other important medications. :)
You don’t soak the almonds in water, overnight, before blending?
6:34 Screams of the underworld
What cookware brand are you using?

Please make the supplement video!!!
Taking gut chelators are a good move as your body burden of fukushima radionuclides is actually quite considerable. Of course, these do not mitigate the ubiquitous airborne fallout
わぁ！
第二弾だ！
シリーズ化してほしい笑
あとは、今日の１日とか笑  

なんでそのサプリなのか聞いてみたい
オシャレですね〜
いつも見てます！
I miss the wooden wall kitchen but this is not bad too :)
Yay! Love these!
Even the way he holds that pack of noodles is perfect 😁
I enjoy your videos. A gentle hint, you know your coffee and keeping roasted beans in an air proof container is correct but you should also keep the beans in a light proof container as well.
lol you're kind of on the noisy side :p
Please make a video to explain the supplements
he should show workout video just in his undies :D
These videos are so calming to watch
Great video! How many grams of pasta did you use for one serving? Thanks :)

You look like Jeremmy Renner😁
We want MOARRRRR!!!!!!

Btw, thank you for being you! Watching your videos calms me and motivates me to be more productive :) I’m really inspired by your videos! 

I would love to see those supplements you take! I have been wondering what are those since your last what I eat in a day videos! And I would also like to know some tips to start being vegan and have a healthy lifestyle like yours!

Once again, thank you!
I probably want to be like you until I am 40+. I mean a single organized discipline man.
Fresh made almond milk daily omg 😮
ganteng bat Ya Allahhhh
I love the concrete walls
Looove youu 😚❤️❤️
I have waited a long time to see this. The lighting in the last part of your video looks interesting and even cozy. I hope you are feeling better. Thanks for sharing your life.  :)
I need to learn japanese man...when are we getting married
太りました？
6:35 scared the hell out of me lol!
Please do a house tour Ryoya! 家見学してください!
Where did you get your cookware from?
Do vegan impose their children to be vegan as well?
I can watch him slide banana all day
oh noooo! banana oats without cinnamon! 😋
this house is luxurious tho...i live in tokyo and the moment i see his knife and coffee machine and the FREAKING size of his room, i just got misty eyes...but that said, thumbs up for a disciplined and healthy lifestyle. The way he treats himself definitely deserves respect!
I like you. From Thailand
Oh, so you're Japanese?
the purest Japan man
I would be interested in to why you take those supplements if you're willing to share.
Pfft, who needs wife anyway?
Are you vegan?
Keep it up
Its so good to see you talk in videos...
Do you have a weekly/monthly meal plan?
興味あります~🙋🏻‍♀️
I like, a want that you talk about your suplements
イタリアのピスタチオソースをもらったのですが、スイーツで何かいい使い道ありますか？
Lovely video, thank you for sharing! I wanted to ask, do you eat any snacks between your meals? Any fruit, or chocolate, or anything?
What a calm voice 😉
1:36 oddly satisfying....
料理めちゃ上手いですね!!w最近ヴィーガンになったので真似できるところから真似させて貰いますφ(･ω･*)
where did you get your sink organiser? that thing that holds your sponges? thanks :)
I love your videos ! 😁❤
What about B12?
I need a husband like him...
Make a workout video
Supplementsのこと聞きたいです！お楽しみています！
I'm interested in the supplements! Looking forward to it
I feel like he’s too organized.....
サプリメントの動画見たいです！
& is no one gonna even mention what a beautiful human that Takeshima is??? Such calm and peaceful vibes, and so clean and organized. Mannnn... 😍💛✨
Yes, please make video on why do you take all those supplements
What type of pan are you using?
This would be nooot enough food for me. But all looks very good 👀✨
What about seasoning??
サプリの動画めっちゃ期待してます！！！！！
wow o.o im amazed
Love this video! <3
Wait, are you back in your old home? Didn't you move? I am so confused.
Charcoal combined with other suplements? Okey those suplements are useless
I always wondered why you take that many pills, I just take B12 and every vegan I know does the same. There are a few that takes protein because they workout but apart from that they don't take anything else
Doesn't the clay and charcoal plug you up?
I haven't watched your channel in a while. You have a new house! Your life inspires me.
Definitely make that supplement video!
do you know if olive oil is not good if u heat it..?
I wanna be his wife.  😍😍😍😍😍
If you take the charcoal at the same time as the other supplements the charcoal will prevent the absorption of the other supplements and make them basically moot.
wow im fasta than sanic
めっちゃおしゃん
ご飯が割と日本人だった
That vitamix seems quieter then the other ones. I should’ve gotten that one instead when I was contemplating which one to use. Now I hardly use mine cause it’s so loud since I live in apartment. lol
Why are you following this diet when your country's normal diet is already one of the healthiest on the planet?
Finally! A new video.
530am 😑😑😑 then I realize he is a single man . I need my beauty sleep as a mom of four kids 😬
Such a bland flavourless meal that pasta was lol. All dem hipster ingredients probably cost u 5,000 yen a day to eat
merda
merda
m**
Yes, please explain supplements!
I don’t even cook so wondering why this was in my recommendations 😆 well anything to take my mind off of my assignment 👌
Im in love😍
サプリ興味あります！
Thank you for making this video. Would be interesting to know the reason why you take supplements. Some take it to benefit their gym routine, some take it to fill the missing nutrients from their diet, some take it just to stay healthy for long time and some take it for strengthening their bones. So basically everyone has their own reason and would love to know yours.
Love your videos man
do you live in an apartment?
今回も相変わらずカッコいいですね
ryoya back at it again with the protein
パスタの量は決めてるの？
I've never seen someone make oatmeal that texture. Looks weird. But kinda good.

He sounds very sleepy 😂
旬の野菜使ってて良いですね！
Ya Make the video about the supps!
And please make the supplements video also
I'm new on your channel so was the first time seeing your face and definitely do a supplements video and a house tour
Plz make a video about the supplements. I'm trying be vegan someday but if I eat just like you, i will be hungry all the time. So how can you do that? Any advice for me? Many thanks.
why you chose to be a vegan?
ヴィーガンではないですが、とても少食な上にお米やお肉を食べると具合が悪くなっちゃうので、サプリメントの動画を見たいです。
体重は減るわ力は出ないわで結構困ってます…。
“It smells like... Asia “ 😂♥️
This is the only “What I Eat in a Day” I actually believe
I want to marry either a Japanese, Chinese or a Korean man. I'm an Indian and wish to have hybrid babies.... I'm sure East Asian Men are dope....💕💕💕💕
I bet that veggie soup must be so good for upset stomach.
He seems lonely
I love your lifestyle. Its extremely aesthetic to me!
Did you had a nose job?
I wish you could cook for me 😂
his hands and arms are so nice
please explain your supplements! :)
Watching him eat healthy after I just downed a burrito makes me sad
Your pans and bowls are beautiful. Where are they from? What's their brand?
hiyokomame miso no recipe please!!!!!!

The bracelet you wear on your right hand we wear it (we Greeks) every year in March!! It’s a tradition that says that if you wear this you avoid sunburn during the summer. Do you have the same tradition???
What about russian borsch???
Is he vegan?
You should put a cloth under the cutting board. So when you cut or chop it won't make any knocking sound.
Wow!!!
the Big Bang theory dvd on the desk!
Is it weird to say you have hot hands? Probably... But you do.
Why the hell that almond milk looks like actual MILK THE ONE I DRINK IS FROCKIN GRAY—-

早起き、運動、食事…生き方の基本がきちんとしてるとこが、かっこいいな。

あと、あの植物が元気そうで嬉しいです。

Takashima san , I've been held it quite a long time , but now i want u to know , i freakin love veins in your hand . Am I weird ?
thank you so much
those are a beautiful pair of scissors
this is like the saddest looking food i've seen on youtube; healthy or not i bet he is very depressed. he even sounds like all life has left him long time ago
Thank you 🙏🏼🙂
I think you are consuming too much protein for your body weight
husband material
Oh yes please!
What can I say, he's living a life while we don't
Welcome back :)
I am from Peru ! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What kind of blender that you using to blend the almond milk?
3rd
i aspire to be this organized
Edamame pasta is very nice. It's also very very high in protein but it's not dry or crumbly. Rather, it has a nice springy texture. BTW: Your new apartment turned out to be quite nice! Congratulations on your new well appointed home.
Is he single? 😅
Pls make a video to explain the supplements u take everyday! Thanks!
Don't take MSM!! It destroy your body!! It's proved that it will do!! My uncle died because of MSM!!

How do you make your miso? Please make a video about it.

Yes make video of why you eat the supplements you have please!!!
yess pleaseee
For your information,
American measuring cup = 236ml
Japanese measuring cup = 200ml
Japanese measuring cup for rice = 180ml
This is why I used gram instead of cup in English instruction.
Why did I think u was gonna make rice out of the bamboo
"Bamboo Shoot Rice" i instantly thought of Harvest Moon. ♥️♥️♥️
Watching your video before going to sleep is kinda therapeutic for me. Thanks for making more video and I hope you'll have steady release from now on with the kitchen already completed
Press like if you want Ryoya to open a cafe where he served his coffee and vegan foods and listen to his own music Σd=(･ω-｀○)ｸﾞｯ♪
I’ve learnt so much about vegan cooking from your videos. They’re amazing 😊
I often open your video while I was working. I don’t watch it, I hear it. This is really peaceful sound, like my mother’s in cuisine. I miss my family so much.
Wow the production quality is just amazing, I love it! Wish I could achieve the same for my videos, but I am not there yet
what is the machine you use for your rice ?
I'm not a fan of bamboo, but I just love your video (s). I'm waiting for the moment when I will watch your videos on Netflix. So cinematic! You're such an inspiration! 🙌
サムネイルの筍が寄り添ってるみたいで可愛い
折角ならそのまま米ぬかアク抜きに使えばよかったんに
朝市で竹の子売っていた生産者さんに、白子竹の子の下処理と調理法について詳しく聞いてきたから間違っていないとは思うんだけど、扱い方がどっか間違ってたらごめんね。笑

I really wonder sometime, how do you get those such amazing machine from ??  I really need those machines to help me hehe 😂😂😂😂
One of my favourite food is Bamboo shoot kari, but i actually love it thick...
I try this. Thanks for sharing!
can i ask you why do you use a beautiful Chef knife but cutting like Santoku way'?
The way you line these bamboo shoots just so cute
Lovely. Nice recipe too.👌🏻🌸
I love your videos from Toronto Canada!
in my hometown we usually cook this with coconut  milk, it's one of my favorite food
It's really good to see your video again! Waiting for the next one:))
Watched both versions 👨‍🍳😊🙌🎥 I’ll have to make a spicy version of this 🌶
<3 simple , lovely !
私はお醤油は大さじ2が美味しいと思います(*^^*)
I really enjoy your video, i even play peaceful cuisine to accompany me study
Hi Ryoya, curious on what font you use for your titles/words?
Hm. Rune Factory 4 brought me here. 😂
はああああ、ごちそうさまでした←
When i saw bamboo pic
I thought it was a head of chicken
Tus videos me relajan demasiado 💚
5:40 I love your Damascus steel knife! So beautiful!
Edit: Also, can you follow this same recipe with lotus root instead of bamboo shoot? I noticed a comment below that someone doesn't like bamboo shoot. Could you also try this recipe with something like a jicama?
Dang theres barely anything edible left on bamboo shoots...
美しい包丁で、生の筍を切る音がとても耳に気持ちいいですし、新鮮ですね。芸術品を見たような気持ちになりました。白子筍ならではの、逸品ですね。素晴らしい動画をありがとう！
What do you call that rice processing thing?
I usually cook the bamboo shot to make a clear sour spicy soup and call it sayur asem :)
this was my fave recipe in harvest moon omg
Bamboo shoot rice! This reminds me of harvest moon:)
I feel violated by that ;) at the end. Do it again ;)
I am gonna try to make some Bamboo Shoot Rice now
熱々の炊きたてご飯に、息をふーっとかけて、少し表面を冷まして、食感を一口ごとに変えて食べるのが好きです。
マニアックですかね？伝わって欲しいなぁ
I really enjoy watching your video!
もうタケノコの時期ですかぁ・・・柔らかい部分が好きなんだw
旬の食材は美味しいですよね🤤
炊き上がりも美しい
筍ご飯食べたい
大好物です😄
Better method is u should chop the bamboo shoots first and then keep it in water overnight...
The sound of bamboo being cut is like music to my ears!
Too peaceful, it's lolling me to sleep and it's not yet time!!!
FINALLY! 😭
タケノコを水に一晩つけるだけってのが、初めてです❗でも、そのほうが香りがよくておいしそうですね❗
Japanese rice is really delicious. In my experience, soaking bamboo shoots in rice water with a little salt will help whiter, less bitter.
Bamboo shoot lodeh is the best. With mushroom. Rebung lodeh
I feel like if i look at that knife too hard it'll cut me. Yikes! Awesome Recipe!
Sir, you don't peel the skin one by one...you make a cut on the outside curve of the bamboo shoot through the layers and then you can pull the skin off
Rice ignorant Irishman here, that's more used to potatoes. Please, what did the machine do to the rice?
サムネの筍さんが首かしげてるみたいでかわいいですね
たけのこご飯食べたいな～～
I only know bamboo shoot from harvest moon..
Thx 4 video i know the real now.. :)
Whoooo, I have never been faster in my life
お、御神酒??
待ってました！
素敵な動画ありがとうございます😊
どんなお味でしたか？？

また春の京野菜を使った料理動画みてみたいです(*´∇｀*)
観てるだけで空腹と眠気が(^^)
I enjoyed your soba video several years ago and wished that I would some day be able to enjoy soba in Japan. So finally I’m here and going to eat soba in Sobanomi Yoshimura in Kyoto, tonight. i can’t wait!!!
Can you make strawberry shortcake next? Pls?
I like the wok, been looking for something like that for some time. May I know where did you get it?
手仕事が外国人にも伝わるんですねえ。
野菜を入れないところが粋
That Damascus knife if beautiful
白子の筍で作る筍ご飯ですか、、、
筑前煮がとても柔らかくて美味しかったから、筍ご飯でも、歯応えがあって、なおかつ柔らかさもあるものになるのかな？
今回もありがとうございます(￣￢￣)
Your knife is an art piece.
You deserve a sub!
動画を見ながら寝落ちしてました…マイナスイオンが溢れてます😊🌱✨
美味しそう(✿︎´ ꒳ ` )
why do u soak it overnighti
グローバル対応！！！
Hi from Bahrain 🇧🇭
This got to be the most amazing knife I have ever seen. Haha
Great ASMR
Idk why i sense a great loneliness in this one... I hope... You're okay, and everyone is okay. Have a great day😊
I'll try this. I love bamboo shoot.
this is the real art of making a cooking video. those sounds.
Firs.....oh never mind!
I loved the sounds :)
Good to sleep!
Liweut Rebung
In Indonesia it call liwet👍
I always see fresh bamboo shoots at the local asian supermarket, you've inspired me to get some and try this recipe! I looks so delicious :)
計量スプーンってどこのメーカーのですか？？
What do i serve the rice with?
The Damascus knife !
I know this menu from a game name’s Harvest moon.
The type of bamboo used here is not what we have, so I don't know how it would taste. But the recipe itself looks good. So,  I'll have to try it when bamboo shoot season comes
Hello Ryoya!!!
Your vids are fantastic! The only thing I'm missing is the "tasting part"... I think that would give a new dimension to your awesome vids...
🇯🇵❤️🇩🇪❤️🇯🇵❤️🇩🇪❤️🇯🇵❤️🇩🇪❤️
bikin yang lebih banyak dong:"(
具がシンプルで、とても旨そうです。
looks delicious. in Assamese we call this 'baah gaaz' and rice (বাঁহ গাজ আৰু ভাত).
Peaceful San the kind of guy who owns a greater variety of kitchenware than my local Bestbuy.
This is the best birthday present ever. Peace be with you.
Wish he made another entree to eat with that bamboo rice.😯
You perhaps read my comment, could u make a asmr but still have a cinematic look like this?😁
What kind of stove do you use?
It's just rice. . . Its just rice . . . right? But why does it feel like it's on a whole new level. I felt like I was watching rice being cooked for the gods.
I love your videos! 💕
桜で染めたTシャツ着てましたか？🌸全身が見たかったです＾＾美味しそう😋💕🍚
Request for how you edit your video. I like your mood and tone.
Are you going to show your new kitchen?
Why throwing around spoons?
I love these videos! Feel so good!!
What did you do to rice in that machine before washing it? Great vids!
サムネかわいい
サムネかわいい
インドネシアで"rebung"というものです。面白いビデオと思います。
いつも楽しく拝見しています！♡
Nasinya gak mateng 😅
筍を切る音がたまりません。
This reminds me of something from a comix wave movie. The dish is simple, but it looks so good.
I thought it was a chicken head on the thumbnail lmao 🤦
このタイマーほしい！！！！
新鮮なタケノコだからこそできる、下茹でせずに香りも楽しめる素敵な竹の子ご飯ですね(*´ω`*)
This reminds me of a  Japanese story of a woman who came out of the bamboo tree.
包丁がまな板に当たる音が凄く響くような感じがしました。以前のお部屋より天上が高いから？か物がないから？もっと柔らかい音になるといいなぁ✨でも筍の引き裂かれるような音は凄く好きです❤️
In my country, it called "rebung"
Was much better without the music (dnt get me wrong the music is good, but the video is much better off alone)
見ていたら竹の子ご飯が作りたくなりました。ほんと春って感じですね。
また動画内で桜染のTシャツを着られていましたね！良い色合い♡
米食べるんだ。
りょうやさんの料理は相変わらず美味しいそう。。
Can u love my comment too 😊
Jangan bong
The background music should be turn off. Imo
Ryoyaさんの動画は落ち着きます◡̈⃝♩いつもありがとう
Wow long time no see 😃🍚🎋🎍
I already try it. It isnt worth the effort guys. Believe
わ―... 美味しいですね！ 😊😄
Some tense, melancholy music here; it's like someone preparing a meal for their own funeral lol
Hi Takashima san！Did u ever try the bitter bamboo shoot from southern China？
In indonesia we cook that bamboo as a soup. Slice them smaller add tumeric n spices. Spicy Yummy
using different water for different ingredients? I am shocked by how detailed your cooking is! Great work!
人参で彩り欲しいっすね
最初は小気味良いと思っていた演出や道具も毎回時間を掛けられると面倒臭いてなっちゃうなぁ。
これは改善してくれとかのクレームじゃなくて、一個人の意見だからね、悪しからず。

Asmr
💖💖💖💖💖💖
タケノコってそんなに剥かないといけなかっただなんて…！
Sincerelly, Im from Puerto Rico and don’t like so much this food, but i see all your videos, because are a perfect combination of photography, method and SOUNDS. Exquisite! I like your DIY videos so much.
筍のアク抜きは一晩浸水だけなのですか？ 
せっかく精米して出来立てのぬかがあるのにもったいないなぁと思いました
What is that appliance @ 2:00?
もち米？
There's so much of the bamboo shoot that you can't eat. Do you compost the parts you cut off?
お皿に盛らないパターンは珍しいですね！
I suppose it's rare not to serve on dish!
oy, it's really slow...
OMG the music, so dramatic! I started to feel bad for the bamboo shot.
エンジョーイ！！！
料理動画だ～✨
🖤
Beautiful video!
Damascus knife
ビーガンの方でも酒は飲まれるんですか？
this bamboo shoot likely was bitter...because that's what happens when bamboo shoots start growing into bamboo stalks with the chambers....
red dot on bamboo make me scared :(
Ca me donne le bambou
cool!!!!!!!
It looks like artichoke
I love bamboo shoot but this cuisine is new to me. Hopefully,I will try someday and looks yummy btw.
Hello. I found a YouTube page that awfully looks like yours....りょうやさんは別アカでレシピを出していますか。

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvsC0R9lQ3ibbci3_y4fiwQ
今日たけのこご飯にしようかな〜
やっぱり京都だと良いたけのこが手に入るんでしょうか。
Mesmerizing!
Eating the rice with bran is healthier option, isn't it?
わけぎとかごちゃごちゃ入れたくなるんですが、やっぱり、シンプルな味好みになりますよね。これは晩酌にも持って来い。焼いても良いですね～いやー京都良いわ～
ぜんぜんお米研がないのですね。びっくりしました。
It is satisfying to see him cutting bamboo shoot
いまいちどこに住んでんのかわからへんねんけど。日本に住んでるんそれとも外国？
こちらの精米機は、とても小型で使いやすそうです。よろしかったら、メーカーと品番教えて頂けたらとおもいます。
This guy know how to make video
Does anyone else think besides me that once the bamboo shoot is fully pealed and put in the glass of water, that it actually looks a botfly!? 🤔
This video makes me romanticise cooking healthy meal and that's the kind of energy I want in my kitchen.
Could you do a croissant recipe ? Btw, i love your videos ♥ Thxx
Ich bewundere deine Videos.
what filter is he use? please
I love bamboo shoots, love from India.
灰汁抜きはしないんですか？
Fail
贅沢にたけのこが入ってて美味しそう。
まだちびっこたけのこしか出回ってないから、大きいのが出たらやってみよう。
Indonesian people also eat bamboo
Really peaceful.  No lousy BGM, no bullshits.
I have eaten this so many times and I never get tired of it. It is very delicious and I'd say great for cold weather.
i only focus the knife...
so simple and beautiful
Is that a damascus knife?
そのシャツ染めてたやつですか？
This is bland.
I love bamboo shoots
no taste
ミサンガ取ってくれ
アク抜きとかはしないんですか？
Well if I ever happen to stumble across a bamboo shoot and that funky machine you used on the rice, I would love to give this recipe a try.
Any reason why we need to soak it overnight?
are you wearing tridatu bracelet ?
💚💚💚
Does soaking the common seaweed packets sold in stores also result in good/okay Dashi?
Masak rebung 😋
맛 있는 영상 잘봤습니다.!!!  엄지척은 기본!!! 👍👍👍👍😁😁😁💘
Memma
very slow video -_-"
That’s an awesome knife
拍摄速度太做作了。要快进。
いつも拝見してます！京都は新鮮で美味しいタケノコが気軽に手に入りそうで良いですねえ^_^
タケノコ手に入れたら作ってみたいと思います！
That looks super interesting! What does bamboo shoot taste like?
Excellent My Friend!
Perfect Video!!  Wowwwww!
Super Like 2434!  Success! 
Hugs from Brazil!!  DG Tudo
What did the machine actually do ? How did it turn the rice white?
Is that "Satake" machine a mill or what does it do?
Idk but, i think the bamboo need to be cooked two times, i mean he should boil the bamboo first then he can cook it as he want.
@Peaceful Cuisine great video as always! If you do not mind me asking, what was that machine for rice for? A husking machine?
Why do you start putting music.
I cant stand the smell of bamboo shoot haha
Most probably i will add some coconut milk to it instead of sake. Seems like a fun recipe
15 minutes the bamboo shoot wouldn't get cook at all
What kind of your knife?
It is nice but it seems like it would have taken days to just make some bamboo shoot rice.
I have never seen a fresh bamboo Shoot!  I don't think you can get them in Ireland, only cut up ones in cans...I'll have to have a look around.
Poor baby bamboo 😔
Is y'all bamboo smells stink there? Our bamboo here smells like pee tho. So stink. soaking it won't help, it requires hours of boiling it. Even it still leaves the bad odor
In the first part of the video- is that one of the items you dyed with cherry blossom tree?
Hey. Please write the name of your manual timer or a link where I can buy it. Thank a lot
Where can I find a timer like that?
Does soaking the bamboo shoot overnight give the same result as boiling it?  It's because here in my town,  we boil them before cooking them and it's my first time seeing it  prepared that way. And thanks for the idea:)
2:08 What does this device do?
I'm from North East India and people here love bamboo shoots. In our culture we preserve it in big  glass jars so that we can have it through out the year. So after few months it becomes more sour and releases water (we also love the fresh ones). We usually have it with pork, chicken, fish and with fermented fish condiment.
I'm sorry to say this, but i kind a miss your old kitchen, it make me feel peaceful, warm and classic, but i still love about your cooking
if i may ask, please make you version of banoffee :(
One of the indonesia cuisine, we usually cook bamboo shoot for kind of a stew with coconut milk and spices. Almost same like indonesian curry style. Maybe you can try to make it :)
May I know what’s the brand of your portable stove?
Looks incredibly delicious..we could never get fresh bamboo in the uk I wonder if a tinned would work?
りょうやさんなら土鍋でご飯炊き始めそうだけど、おなじみのフライパンで炊いてますねｗ
このたけのこご飯と漬物とみそ汁で食いたい！！
what did you do immediately after measuring the rice? not sure what that machine was.
What's different of rice and sticky rice?
Why did you soak the bamboo shoot overnight?
もう少し明るい曲にすればいいのに
You should work at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant
Hey there, Takashima-san. It's quite a some time since your last video. How is it going? :) Still making recipe videos? Heck yeah you did 🙌♥️
This video is making me hungry. Is this what bamboo shoot from early spring is like? It sounds crunchy as you cut it. What texture is it like?
First comment！
中華鍋で炊くとはっ
生のたけのこは今だけですもんね。食べたい。
メンマも作りたいけど、ヴーガン だと、塩と醤油とごま油？かなぁ
もし、レシピあったら教えてください。
what is kombu?
Can I use regular grass here in Texas? Since bamboo is just grass?
3rd
I really like your videos but I feel so bad when I see how much plastic you use in each on them !
I really love all of your recipes 
There are sooo delicious !!
Can you do one of crumble please ?
植物がかわいそう
I hope you could change using bottle water to tap water. The tap water may not be great to taste or to consume wherever you are, but still you could use a filter so you reduce your plastic impact. Correct me if I'm wrong.
am i the only one who thinks the thumbnail looks like some janky ass toes or
R u a boy or girl’?
Shud be 3-4 min video. Wasting many seconds like opening bottle, unwrapping salt cover, stove arrangement, slicing bamboo in different angles, unnecessary shots..
ryoya... aren't you an asian why do you use spoons to measure the rice????
amazing video, but the recipe looks like it'd be as boring as unsalted boiled rice
I felt like watching an art cinema, a guy living alone, his daily chores and finally committing suicide. 😁
I wish there wasn't any music...
Is it me or have you lost your touch a bit? Your old videos used to be a piece of art. This was quite boring if i had to say honestly.
The most pretentious rice making video on youtube

The directions for this dish could have been a 2 sentence text post.
You roast and grind your own coffee beans. I should have expected that you would mill your own rice.
You have hands down the best cinematography out of all the food channels on youtube.
Hi! I just want to tell you that your videos make me feel so relaxed even after a stressful day 😊

Thank you for the wonderful content that you make
Thank you for releasing videos with music and without music! I appreciate it :)
my goat in the college died today so i was so stressed when i got home. RIP pepito.

i open my phone, see the notif and this is exactly what i needed. thanks, ryoya. 👊🏻
legit thought u was gonna make rice out of the bambo lol but this is cool too
Hai...wow u have  your own rice skin peel off machine...this is amazing...
You're such a blessing, like really. I've been having such a hard time going to sleep and your no music videos are really helping. Thank you, Ryoya.
Why do i smell it? Omg i know it must smeelll soooo good, with that rice and bamboo shoot ugh
If you are not used to bamboo shoot aroma it might smell weird and herbish but i damnly know the taste, I am drooling
Looks like comfort food. I feel like eating this now!
A new peaceful video this morning! 😌 Thanks, Peaceful Cuisine.
More satisfying without music
Abang masak rebung aja bisa sekeren ini. ❤️
Aah I remember making this... in Harvest Moon game~
Seriously Takashima-san, you should open a cafe. I’m not joking, just DO IT. Σd=(･ω-｀○)ｸﾞｯ♪
朝市で竹の子売っていた生産者さんに、白子竹の子の下処理と調理法について詳しく聞いてきたから間違っていないとは思うんだけど、扱い方がどっか間違ってたらごめんね。笑
I love that you put your videos out without music. I always prefer these 💕
わー。。生の竹の子をザクザク切る音、初めて聞きました！
毎年苦労して竹の子の灰汁取りで長時間煮ている私としては、ぜひともこの白子竹の子、手に入れてみたいなぁ✨
ボブクレイマーの美しい包丁、やっぱり好きです。
心が癒される動画、ありがとう。
I enjoy your videos very very much. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
Yummmm looks so delicious 😋 fresh bamboo is so 💰 in Canada 🇨🇦
Once again, you deliver a perfectly tranquil video. Arigato Ryoya-san 👍🏼😀❤
Ya videos are too classy😊
タケノコ親子みたいに並んでて可愛い！笑
カッコいい包丁久しぶりに見れた気がして嬉しいです😆🔪
タケノコ切る音気持ちいい〜☺️
Very Very Good. . .
Perfect!!  Big Like 1881! 
Success, always!  Hugs from Brazil!
筍が切れる音いいですね。ずっと聴いていられそうです。
ちょっとエグそう
Curious to see how you do the dishes... Maybe a "peaceful dishwashing" video? lol
Beautiful! Beautiful! 
Very Very Good! 
Congratulations! #dgtudo
Well, that's a dish that I never knew existed. 
Seems it would benefit from some more seasoning.
Your videos are the best therapy <3  Food for the heart, eyes and soul. :)  Can you do a vegan candied ginger ice cream one day?  I miss it so much... I wish I could taste it again.  Thank you for brightening my day. ♫♪♫♪
Who else is here just to watch this, and not make the recipe...
its oddly satisfying :o...
These videos are getting better and better every time, Keep up the good work Mr. Ryoya Takashima.
Fascinating and very hypnotic. Excellent video. Thanks.
¿Cómo rayos se encienden esas estufas? (Sin gas)
There’s such a relaxed vibe on your videos. 

Thanks.
Oh No music, merci!!! Merci 😘 j'adore
Reminds me of Bamboo Rice at Harvest Moon Back To Nature game...
I thought the bamboo shoots in the thumbnail were fish heads 😂💀
Thanks for sharing...that knife and stop watch was bomb..I am loving it so much 😍😍😍
I will be looking for kombu sheets..never heard of them but looked them up and they sound delicious 😋
I read the title so fast and thought you were making baboon rice 😅😂 I need coffee. Anyway loved this and I would like to try to make this.
I'm so glad you cook bamboo shoot. my favorite.
I love David a kind, Tobi loved a lot and you are so sweet - Thank You, for you r Videos
It makes me so hungry 🤤😍
I just stumbled on this and I LOVE the no-music concept. It's pure and organic. No background noise, as it is unnecessary when watching a food prep/mixing. It's like I'm in someone's kitchen watching and hearing the sounds of utensils, water, and those of stirring, pouring, crushing, etc.. Thanks!
You are back, I am Glad you came again.
Wish you would make "Satai Padang Vegan" somedaaaay💁
i thought he was gonna cook the rice inside a bamboo lmao
I wish I could make rice that with such care.

Rice and coffee bring me to this channel. Also the vegan alternatives have always intrigued me, to enhance my diet.
I definitely prefer this to the music version.
you have a gorgeous knife 😍
It's that season already.
My youtube is full with bamboo shoot hunting, cooking and eating reccomendation 😎
My homelands' (or at least, my family home) recipe with bamboo shoot will be to cook them with coconut milk, spices and herbs alongside long bean (or any other veggies you like) served as a side dish for our rice 😋
Whenever I feel like reading a food manga or looking at food articles and illustrations I think: "Peaceful Cuisine." You really inspire me.
I miss this taste from my childhood.  I didn't know how to make it or that it has sake and shoyu in it.  I have no one to ask anymore.  Now I know.  I'm going to make it tonight!  Arigato for another simple vegan recipe and another beautifully done video.
You have a beautiful chef's knife - what brand is it?
Ok so,..

That is one beautiful knife.
A lot of love from France <3
Which software you used for video editing?
Love that chef knife.  Bet you could shave your face with it!  :)
The filter you add on your videos changes the mood 😌 I love it.
with that fancy damascus steel knife
色が茶色っぽいから雑穀米なのかなと思いながら観てたけどまさか精米から始めるとは......
I have been eating this for my whole life and never realized they are bamboo...
Much better,no music versions
3:30 who's the king ? 😅 👑🤴😎
Where are your beautiful knives from? The world must know!
筍ご飯か😋💕良いですね💕お腹空いてきちゃいました＾＾
Bamboo shoots are very tasty.  It is very interesting to see it prepared from scratch.
Hola saludos cordiales y espero que estés muy bien
外国人の方のコメント多いw
おいしそう😌食べたい
No music 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌✊✊
This can be made in curry or coconut milk soup in java and you can add tofu and tempeh
in my country it's called "rebung"
I Love How you do your videos especially with measurements and Such. Stellar Videos! Keem Em Coming! ♥
First 😂 😂
Thank you for uploading both with and without music!
Perfect 👌
Try lumpia.

いつ見ても惚れ惚れする映像と素晴らしい料理、最高の癒しになってます😆
シャキシャキ...もぐもぐ....
So awesome you do a no music version as well!
Qué le hizo al arroz en la máquina?
Please, pretty please, do Green Tea
You're the best! Although, I must say it'd be nice to see you take a bite of the food after putting forth so much effort to prepare
Looks like from the start they look like penguin look at the top
Love that knife!
Hey nice bracelet, is it Balinese?
What does bamboo taste like?
What does bamboo taste like?
I like the taste and the texture of bamboo, but is there any way to get rid of the smell?
Itu daun pandan?
Can you make mochi?
first ✨
今日はこれを聴きながら寝ます♡
This made my morning ☀︎☁︎
良い音だなぁ〜ってぼーっと見ている内に終わってた…
That knife is gorgeous!!  What is it and where can I get one?
Harvest moon?
So satisfying as always
You should consider don’t use plastic water bottles
Prefer no music haha
Welcome back!
How far do you set up your camera from the food?
You have lovely hands.
🖤
Wow that knife 🔪 👍🏻
May I know what is the use of that machine at 2:06?  What did you do with those rice??
Wo hast du das alles gelernt?  Sorgfältig, achtsam und wunderschön! Vielen Dank für deine kostenlosen Kochvergnügen.
CRONCH
Love it so much
Or not lmao
The most asian dish ever.
First
💖
Am i the one who feel this video is different as usual? Sound and the last serving is a bit different
So relaxing to watch 😌😋
京都幻の竹の子、凄いです。
❤️
Isn't the cloudy rice water meant to be healthy and the outer shells/fiber meant to have more nutrition in them that you seem to remove completely?
Your hands need to be casted and preserved.
たけのこのたべれる部分、そんなちょっとだったんか、、、
In countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, we  make a kind of savory curry with some coconut milk using the bamboo shoot and eat with rice...
this makes asmr seem like a joke
What an aesthetic knife
Rebung di Semarang jadi lumpia kang,
I’m here early!
real art. can you sometimes give us a smile?
i thought he put the rice inside the bamboo shoot
Nice ryoya san.. 😁
Looks yummy. Love bamboo.
Proč mě baví zrovna tohle 😄
今日上品やな
что же делалось?)))))
what do u eat this with? and what does bamboo taste like?
cool
ofcourse its me again, why not put in the kelp?..
I'm gonna lose my mind WHAT IS THE SORCERY BEHIND NO-MUSIC COOKING VIDEOS??????? WHY ARE THEY SO SOOTHING?! Someone who knows science: EXPLAIN THIS!!! Why am I so entranced by these things??? Why are they so soothing??? I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!!
Wow! What kind of microphone do you use?
What is the machine for the rice? & What does it do?
Dear husband ty babe 💕😍💞😘🇬🇧💖
wanna see peaceful mango cutting? Then check out this sloth :)
Wow 😮! I wonder what he does for a living, the knife he’s using cost thousands of dollars 😱 plus all the machines and equipment 😱😱
Can you substitute sake with something else?
Being your average American, I've only ever had canned bamboo shoots but I'm now wanting to try fresh. Those in the know, how does the taste and texture differ between fresh and canned and also the difference between what I can likely find at my local Asian grocery versus these Shiako ones?
久し振りに動画にお米が登場したので、疑問に思っていたことを質問させてください。
ヴィーガンのRyoyaさん的には「合鴨農法で作られたお米」は食べられますか？
精米機はどこのメーカーを使ってますか？
今夏日本に帰った時に買って帰ろうかとあれこれ探しているので、お教えいただけるとありがたいです。
Well what was the purpose of sake?
京都の朝市とかで買うんですか？
私、ベニシアに憧れていて
いいなって
て、りょうやさんテレビ観ます？
I'm just a simple guy..
I saw bamboo shoot,I clicked.
姫皮のところは使わないのですね。
動画内で触れてないだけで実際はお吸い物とかに使ったのかも知れないけど、これ見て作る外国の人は食べられない部位なのかと思って棄ててしまいそうですね。
mottainai…
not to ruin this for anyone, but the peeled bamboo shoot reminds me of a bloated botfly maggot
Beautiful video. Your place must be filled with that wonderful aroma of coffee...Hmmm.
if you open a coffee or cafe shop, i will pack my stuff up and spend a whole month at your shop to enjoy your coffee and your cooking (´ ꒳ ` ✿)
It must smell heavenly in your kitchen after a roast
i dont even like coffee but im watching the entire video because its so beautiful
It's currently 1AM , I've got exams tomorrow.
I should be sleeping , but instead I've decided to stay up and watch peaceful cuisine.

no regrets
This made me cry. A beautiful video. It reminded me of my childhood. My grandmother had a manual coffee grinder and used to roast her coffee beans, too. I miss her.
Love the non-electric gadgets. Simplistic, silent, satisfying.
Need to also commend you on your choice of background music, it is definitely peaceful :)
I drink tea but I definitely love your videos on how you prepare your coffee :D
Perfect way to start my Sunday. Thank you.
As a coffee junkie, I really admire how you prepared everything. Thank you so much for retelling this art in the most exquisite way. I'm only 23 but I really want to start a café someday, where it feels home, not fast, and every coffee served will bring a lot of good moments. I will really take inspiration from you and your contents, can't express how lucky I am to have stumbled upon your channel. If I ever get to visit Japan, I would really love to meet you. Xo
This is a tipical iced coffee drank in province of Lecce, in southern Italy, i LOVE this coffee! ❤️❤️❤️
watches peaceful cuisine peacefully

_remembers I need to study for exams and sort my life out
_
watches peaceful cuisine stressfully
heyo, just a suggestion, it’d be nice if you used relaxing cello music (since u do play) and bc it’s just a lovely instrument. Lots and lots of love for all ur videos
He's hitting almost everything he's touching. This Peaceful Cuisine sure is violent lol
Where can I purchase that coffee roaster in the USA? I was actually in Japan for the last week but didn't have a single luck finding it. :[
Gave this a try.
Thanks a lot, now i'm late for work every morning.
Beautiful video for sure. Pricey stuff though.
i really think you should be glad i'm not a neighbour because i would stare at you cooking (in person)  every.single.time.
I thought I was a coffee snob. No. It will be a long, long time before I roast my own beans, then manual grind, then manual press espresso, then manual mix my latte. You made that syrup too, didn't you? Admit it. But you didn't make the almond milk, Takashima san! Shame on you! (I'm joking of course).
Luckily he did not make the almond milk from scratch 😀
This makes me really curious about cold brew espresso now, letting the brew head steep for a few hours before pulling the shot.
this is so beautiful!!! i can smell it somehow.
Could you please make another house and kitchen tour ???
Looks amazing. I like iced latte. Thank you for video.
自分で焙煎した豆ってどんな味なんだろう(*´ｪ`*)
兄もコーヒー焙煎機持っているのですが、今度借りてチャレンジしてみようかな
このエスプレッソマシンやっぱりカッコイイ
whats the bg music called?
Great, all manually done now, even grinding :)
So calming! A day in the life of Ryoya would be a blessing.
Argh ! Never touch ice with your fingers, that's take all taste in 1 second 😵
But beautiful job like always 😍
I can almost smell the coffee. perfect video to start my sunday🙏🏻
By the time I do all that I’ll be fully awake and don’t need coffee. Lol
I love the video so much. I can really see the dedication and passion in whatever you do. And I learned how cold pressed coffee is made. Thank you very much. :)
I like your videos. From Mongolia
You have the most beautiful equipment!
These camera angles hit too close to home.
Woah, your video is amazing. This is what I need in my life. Hit me up if you need a roommate. Lol
So relaxing, love your vids, pls make more!
Excellent ... Beautiful ... 
Good Morning!!
Great Week!!     #dgtudo
I love your videos❤️ They are so calm and relaxing.
Beautiful. I myself have coffee hangover (don't know why, I used to be fine drinking coffee 🤔) so I rarely drink coffee but I love the coffee smell. 
I notice that you have Vietnamese coffee. Do you by any chance want to try coffee in Vietnamese style? It'll be so lovely if you do.
 Seem like you bought all those coffee bags in one store. It's so nice of them to tag the national flags in so the buyer can know the source of the coffee, where they come from
Just watching the video makes you crave an iced latte! Watching the entire process from scratch is something I really enjoy about your videos. Thank you!!
I wish I could purchase that roasting instrument. I also wish your english cookbook is on its way. Set up a kickstarter or something, I am willing to contribute to it!
This is so peaceful~ sad that I can't brew my own coffee but it's really nice to watch also. //sip my 3in1 coffee
please, How can I get the music .... I like it 😍
You always do everything neatly and precisely, it's very satisfying. Loving your videos!
É lindo de ver!! Mas se eu tivesse que ter esse trabalho todo pra tomar um cafezim com leite, desistiria na hora.
it is definitely peaceful, i'm your subscriber now :)
This is one of the most beautiful things I've seen on YouTube.
how long did you roasted the coffe bean? i get interested in making after watching your video
Omg what a beautiful video, I enjoyed watching that :) thank you
This video is so simple so natural yet relaxing, peaceful, heavenly, delightful, how many words can I describe this video?
Aw😌 waking up to this in the morning with some soft background song.. would be like a natural healthy therapy💖
I just brewed my evening coffee. This is a great video to drink coffee to.
You have like every device for making/processing foods and drinks xD. I love it!!
Incoming graduating exams are making me so stressed. This video told me that everything is okay and no need to stress. Life is good
Greetings from Russia
ahh...spring has started..are we going to get a vid on those cherry blossoms soon? 
and it's my birthday soon! thanks for the beautiful vid :)
Very peaceful video It refreshed me from my studies thank you ^^ 😊
me watching peaceful cuisine [no music]: hmmm yes ASMR
me watching peaceful cuisine with music: starts tearing up its so beautiful
Great video ryoya ! Thank you... Poor me watching this with instant coffee 😅
every time I see a video at peaceful cuisine, I can always make a passion, why?
I wish the videos were scented.  I used to toast coffee beans for my mom, the aroma is something extraordinary! 
ありがとうございました☕️
nice.. really want to try this my self..

and thank you for choosing Indonesian coffee.. (if i'm not wrong)
Indonesian coffee beans and flair. What a way to enjoy your own coffee! Love it!
Watching this early in the morning is perfect 👌
It is a very beautiful process but I ain't got time for that in the morning!
I love these videos!! Keep up the spectacular work ❤️
I noticed that you are using coffee bean from Indonesia in your Video. 
Is it from Sumatra or some place else?
Good camerawork, sets a good atmosphere and ambience with the BG music
where can I buy the handheld coffee roaster in the US please!    Thanks, Lily from California
Tools, camera quality, music, coffee skills are astonishing 👏
Wait, what, Vietnamese's coffee beans. Hmm, feelin' so proud
coffee beans from CHINA??? 
no thanks
Your hands, and what they create, are beautiful. Thank you.
Omg cannot describe how satisfying your videos are in one word 🙏❤️
beautiful video my compliments I relaxed a lot looking at it, I advise you after roasting it would be better to rest the coffee beans for 10-12 days before grinding it for brewing a perfect cup of coffee. Thanks for sharing your video!
Whoooaaa thats good crema there!!!
watching this is so satisfying, keep up the good work! and i love how you make all these types of drinks too! ♥️
Вот так надо делать правильный кофе. Лайк за хорошо снятый ролик.
Wonderful video and great coffee, learn...
I love this 💗. Thank you.
This is exactly what I love about coffee. The quiet ritual of brewing a cup is so therapeutic.

I'm glad to see you're posting again, I love your videos

I love your new home too, it's beautiful. Where you live can have huge impacts on health.
Thanks for starting my day peacefully ~__~
May i ask, what are u sort before or after the roasting process? Is there any criteria for a good bean? 
Thankyou :)
あぁ美味しそう…
今すぐ飲みたい！
思わず喉ごっくんなります…
you’re such an artist (love from Madrid xx)
This video is so satisfying that I can watch it everyday in the morning without even drinking coffee.
Ryoya! you should try to get coffee beans from El Salvador <3 I would like to see you review it
Ryoya-san! This is amazing!
8 1/2 mins video, 1/2 hours cleaning...
If you want real coffee, like the one in this video, stay away from Starbucks.
Beautiful as always. :D
If you had a coffee shop, i would go every weekend
I’m totally in love with u ❤️ greetings from Mexico 🇲🇽
where do you live? i wanna come and give you a hug! your videos are just so beautiful to watch!
Loved the music, loved the video. I really want some now!
You can be one of the coffee masters/roaster at the Starbucks Tokyo Reserve Roastery
The flair likes a little coarser grind, think that would help you get an even better shot!. =D Love the setup! Great video!
I absolutely love all the vegan recipes! So relaxing and peaceful!
Enrapturing as always, thank you so much for making these videos~ They're like little oases of calm during my week.
6.30am in Sydney, Australia. It's still dark and has started to rain gently. This vid is perfect to watch right now, makes me feel warm ^^ love your vids!
Entah kenapa pengen nangis 😭 , mau buat kopi susu aja seribet ini wkwkwkwkwk 😂😂 semangat bang teruskan hahaha 😃😃
You always work so hard to make these videos 🤩
オシャレなグラスですね(^^)こな飛びは凄そうですが、焙煎のパチパチ音は 癒されます
Seems that I can never acheive 9 bar when making a cold press.  Max 5-6 bars along the way.
high class master!👏
Where have you been? Long time no updates from you.

1. Am I seeing my country flag? Is one of those coffee from Indonesia? Because I'm excited hehe..
2. I am a typical person who cant get along with coffee. I love the aroma but I cant drink coffee. My body will never tolerate it, even if its just in small amount. But I always love to watch the process of making coffee. And your video is one of the best, one of my favorite. It gives me such a healing effect.

Thanks Ryoya-san!
Sometimes seeing these videos makes me cry dude! the respect, the music all in it! you are able to transmit paceful vibes! God bless you!!
That was incredibly relaxing, thank you. ^_^
Oh man! That was the most relaxing and enjoyable video I have ever seen. Loved it!!!
This almost made me cry 😭 beautiful my friend all manually done and cold press .. sending you aloha from Hawaii ❤️
Yay! You have so much new equipment! Happy for you, glad you're back!! :)
Why are japanese so perfect at what they do??? This is already an art form smh
who on earth would dislike this? like what? this is one of the best videos I have watched in years. The filmaking and coffee making skills are out of this earth.
I can literally smell his video
I love your cup! And I'm excited you're uploading again :D
It's really a Zen Presentation!
OMEDETOU
:)
beautiful video.. appreciate the making of a latte. soo good!
I love your videos, they are so incredibly calming <3 Also love how you did the coffee from scratch here!
Indonesia always have d best coffee😍😋
What a masterpiece, I really enjoyed watching all the process. Thank you.
wooohh the dripping sound is so satisfying :3 and the coffee color is just nice
This is beautiful. Love a peaceful ritual x
Genio !!!!! Saludos desde San Luis Argentina
Fantastic !!!Hello from GREECE🇬🇷 🇬🇷 🇬🇷
is that Kopi Luwak from Indonesia?  (*^◇^)_旦
Your videos are so calming♡ im watching from London
Longtime to see you make coffee. Everything still smooth.
Thank you for this. Calming and indeed peaceful. Watching this when I feel anxious or when I get home after a long day at work is very therapeutic.
I love your videos! Greetings frontera México.
i don't drink coffee but it's fascinating to watch
That's how you make the best coffee in the world.... I bet whatever you make taste amazing!!
美味しいアイスラテが飲みたくなりました♡綾也さんが入れてくれたラテなら最高ですね＾＾♡♡
so beautiful! but sadly i cannot consume coffee too much because my stomach always aching when i drink coffe :(
Hey, so...I'm comming to your house in the morning ok?
-sorry, I'll be busy all morning
With?
- coffee
Only bad thing. Your hand roaster. The company WILL NOT ship outside of Japan. They won't even take International orders.
I can't explain you how talented you're!👏👏👏
I bet it smelled amazing in there after he was done roasting.❤
Please make kohakutou (crystal candy made from agar powder) in your next video 🙏
woah you just took coffee to a whole other level.
Super relaxing video !! This is ART of coffee !
Everything must take ages in this house.. I would feel guilty asking for a coffee 😅
Your videos never fail to soothe my soul. Love from the Philippines. 😁
Making my coffee while watching this is everything ☕
I love how you always try out new gadgets, that is such a new way for me to make coffee, and now I want one. ;-;
So satasfying 
I know I spelt it wrong
Glad to see your upload! It feels like its been forever!
That's just coffee with extra steps.
I feel like I tasted it ✨
You could also try the Greek Freddo Espresso procedure. It makes sure the ice blends with the coffee and gives probably lots of aeration which helps with flavour.
watching this while sipping on my instant coffee
i spotted Indonesian coffee <3
I really loved the easiness and simplicity of the art. Loved it.
So simple! And most importantly - you don’t need any fancy equipment to do it.
Make Coffee and build Muscle, this video deserves an award. this should be the coffee alternative for Japanese tea ceremony.
このチャンネルは外国の方にとても人気なのか！魅力のある動画❤️
This video would be much better without background music.  Still excellent
Oh, Coffee bean of Vietnam? I really happy to see you use goods of Vietnam ^^ I’m Vietnamese
氷まで手作りなんだ、、、
すごい、、、。
Excellent!!!! 
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
My face dropped when you poured almond milk in your cup...
The glass you used, I believe makes the whole drink absolutely, beautiful.
hi dude how can i buy the cooking machine?
i am in love with your video, nice job bro
Man you just brought coffee making videos to a whole new level. I just can feel the aroma from your video.
Drinking ordinary coffee while watching yours 🤤
Your food is very delicious and It's very simple to cook them
nd I wish to watch more videos cooking for u
Amo tus videos! Gracias por compartir tus recetas de una manera tan linda! Saludos desde Argentina.
Nothing like coming home from work, watching this channel & slowly drifting to sleep.
ASMR 😍😍
some one should tag EVE CORNWELL
Going to the kitchen to make me some iced latte too 😍 Your videos have a calming effect on me... Thank you!
りょーやさん、こんばんは(^^)
抽出される瞬間、ただただ、純粋に美味しそうで仕方なかったです。
動画で度々拝見してるカトラリーも、安定の存在感でした。
as I was making instant coffee :( one day!
Wow please please do more of these! Beautiful
I Remember His Videos From Back 4-5 Years Ago. No Background Music At All. Was Much Peaceful.
You are something man...hats off👍💓
Your videos are so well filmed and they inspire me to live more peacefully like you too :) Always a pleasure to watch and I eagerly await your next video:)
Such a beautiful video. Also I couldn't help but notice, is that a march bracelet you're wearing?
Fredo Espresso ρε γατάκια
Peaceful video. I'm kinda disappointed that he used regular ice. He should've made ice out of coffee, or milk or both so it wont water down the latte.
How can THIS video get 46 dislikes??!
يعجبني فيك روقانك 😂👌🏼
If you come to Vietnam please let me know. I'll show you some coffee shop here. Thank you for enjoying our beans.
YOOOOOOOO, this is so cool, I don't know anybody who has all this equipment lol but this is awesome to watch! I wanna latte now so bad.
Dont drink coffee but love the smell.... and i swear i smelled it while watching this vid... as if it was coming right through the screen... :)
I loved this video. The ironic part is that it put me to sleep.
So satisfying and a relaxing loved it we love you.
Don’t play the background music.
LOVE THE VIDEO.Indonesia here.
Thank you for the beautiful video.  I hope you enjoyed your iced latte!  Sending you best wishes from California.
You roasting your coffee beans by yourself?? WOW!!!! I am coming from indonesia and i am a coffee addict. Can you share detail tools that you use?
Your videos are so meditative ❤️
UGH YOURE AMAZING JDCJCJDJDJDJDD
hiiiç uğraşmam altıntopuma girer kahvemi alır pişiririm
Not a coffee lover here but still enjoy ur video,calm and peaceful 😊 did u think of making a video of how u clean up after u used them?😉
0:10 oh that is Vietnam's coffee 😮😮😮
ooooohhhh i have been waiting .. i always wanted to try cold pressed coffe, especially latte!
Dear Ryoya-san,

Thank your for sharing your passion. I appreciate your hard work.

In this video I saw you wear a red and white threads on your wrist.
Is it a “martenitsa” from Bulgaria?
Have you ever been in Bulgaria?

Regards from Sofia,
Iván
This guy and Jun makes some of the best kitchen vids
I dont know why but i find your videos satisfying
I watched this during a study break. Really calming thanks!
Amazing smell, thank you
This music reminds me of "I can go the distance" from Disney's Hercules TBH








I love it!! <3
You should definitely open up a cafe I mean god I wanna taste that coffee
I'm in love.
Great. I make videos like this also :)
Love this. It would be great if u can do another video of tokyo/japan vegan restaurant recommendations. I would love to know where i can get such kick ass quality vegan coffee there
I came for the coffee and i stay for the cinematography
My dream is to open a refined coffe shop that makes coffe like you do we don t have one like that in my country
This inspires me to make a cup of coffee myself. 🥤
Too cool kit! I love this video alots, thanks so much for this!
とても美味しそうですね！😋見ているだけで癒されます。
Love your video from indonesia., btw did you use indonesia bean in this video? 0:19
So relaxing and comforting!
Where can i find all your equipment in japan? Im planning to go there again. Your coffee roaster, grinder and ur espresso press.
Coffee too fresh. No good you!
Who else came from that bubble tea video ?😆🥰
and now i regret not having coffee a while ago... love the video ❤
The fact that I really wanted to make a coffee like yours kills me, I don't have utensils so I'm sad
That was ridiculously relaxing. Thank you.
So genuine 🤩🤩
I love watching your way of making things, I learn a lot from you. Tq for sharing 🙏
king of ASMR
One of the most beautiful videos i have ever watched. Thank you
Lovely.. is the grind flour like?
The re usable straw 😩👏🏼 you are just goals
Beautiful lens and dof....and the coffee looks sooooo good!!!!!
Beautifully composed video. What do you think of the flair ? Is it worth it?
My Problem: I dont' habe 2 hours time to make me one coffee
I feel so calm. I wanna drink coffee right now
エスプレッソを水で出すのは目から鱗でした笑
焙煎のあとドライヤーの冷風使うとすぐ冷めて楽ちんです。
あと、排水溝ネット使って生豆をお湯で洗ってから焙煎するとチャフが若干減りますー。
ご存知かもしれませんが笑
You forgot to throw and fire a porcelain cup before making your coffee. 👎
I’m I the only one who watches both versions to experience the difference between music and non music versions. 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Does anyone know what kind of coffee cup he is using?
you pressed the coffee ground with cold water instead of hot?
Great coffee up until he added almond milk
Wow there's coffee/kopi luwak from my country, Indonesia!🇮🇩
Vietnam's coffee really strong
aesthetically pleasing. Somewhat meditative
And a good slice of ham and bread with cow butter for that.
M not even a coffee drinker, but its so satisfying to watch your videos
You need another video for homemaid almond milk 😂
I just love coffee and the smell of it! ❤️
i love these videos!!!! they are always so peaceful and calming to watch
I love the coffee bean crackles when they’re roasted 😌
amazing video, amazing shots, amazing way to make coffee.
Dude you are my aesthetic
10 mins for a cup of coffee
i need a cup of coffee right now~
Peaceful way to brew coffee indeed ❤️❤️👌
I see Indonesian coffee beans there, cheers from Indonesia!
I spot beans from Indonesia! I hope you like the flavour peaceful-san!!
this is my definition of mental therapy
After watching so many unworthy videos , finally i am able to get some peaceful sleep........😴
All this struggle for a latte. Don't you like straight espresso?
Eline sağlık tertibim
Who just casually has all of this in their kitchen😂😂
you have luwak coffee?
Wow. This video brings me the fresh spring air 💚
The sweetener is not mixed in...
Its very nice, all your videos make me feel calm and I feel interested in this coffee because usually I only make hot coffee. greetings from Indonesian
Visual relaxation therapy for the eyes
Wow vietnamese coffee! How does it taste like?
Wow! No words! Just beautiful..
How can I  go to work after watching a video like this......
Only after I watched this video, YouTube suggested me to watch your No music version.
I'm disappointed :(
Everything was perfect till 7:24 fckkk
A meditation in coffee.  Thank you
appalled at myself for watching a guy roast coffee beans so many times
عمل مرتب ونظيف
What roasting machine do you use?? Please let me know 🙂
オレグラッセ作ってみてほしいです^_^
Cheers from Lima-Peru.
Coffee beans from Peru, give it a try.
Kudos to all your work.
Iced matcha green tea latte for the next video??
Thank you sharing your Love 💚
173 dislikes? MONSTERS!
This video is awesome! Iced coffee is my favorite way to drink coffee
I don’t watch cooking videos at all... 
why is this in my recommendation?
So vintage! 💗
The sounds in this video are triggering me :-)
この工程を全部省いたのがネスプレッソだとわかる動画。
Thank you for beautiful video. How much water did you pour?
An updated tour of this new place please!!! Watched the whole series when you were moving into this place!
Didn’t you burn the coffee a little bit?? 😅😅
Gosh I remember when u had just gotten that coffee roaster!
Dudee can u upload more often ? jhahahahahwhawh
Very nice video. Surprised that we got a same grinder :) Thought it's only popular among la Pavonian
Just Perfect. Period.
I Just watched a guy/girl make coffee for 8 minutes. I need to rethink my life choices
It's look so nice!  <3
I love everything about this! I wonder how it compares to traditionally pressed coffee i.e., with hot water. Because this looks very delicious to me!!
Is there a no music version?
I'm still in love with your video's aesthetic. It makes me discover machines I never knew they existed °_°"
Like that coffee press. I don't know how it works but it looks so cool! Oh and the manual roster bean. I love it.
This is extremism ! ;)
" how to stay a virgin for life"
So relaxing! Great! Thanks.
link for those espresso cups would be great if you have it
i see you realy like coffe keep up!
ASMR ❤️❤️
This is another level of "Crazy Russian Hacker kitchen gadgets put to the test series"
Can you help me, i have the signature pro too. And when i try your method with cold water, water overflows above piston and no coffee gets out. Am i doing something wrong ? i use the same grind as when i use regular espresso
Why do i feel like crying while watching this? 😭
his house probably smells amazing
Thanks for the video :) I love it
perfectly mesmerizing
Damn I can smell it. So great video.
Hi, how many hours / days did you wait between roasting and grinding? 
Also, what happened to the La Pavoni! :-O
another amazing background music
Feeling of pure coffee love <3
Where have you been all of my life? <3
Gas flavoured coffee again...
BGMのセンスも最高！癒される✧︎*。
I warm my coffee in the microwave
This gives me peace.❤
Perfect without music👌👍
You taking care of your coffee😊
This was so damn relaxing
WAS IT WORTH IT
Best video to end my Sunday
Thanks from Israel 👍
Oh, my God.. you're so glamorous...!
+1 love from indonesia 🇮🇩
IM SO GLAD UR BACK
God damn ... you make me look like a noob. All I have that's matchable is a HG-1 grinder, and an Acaia Lunar. The rest, you've got me beaten.
What handheld coffee grinder do you use?
I enjoy the crispiness of the sound in his video. So much love for his visual work. And I am a coffee lover, so double thumbs up!
This makes me want to like coffee
Where can I find a lovely coffee roaster like that?
These are 1000x more pleasing than asmr videos
Thank you for soothing my soul
Omg, its so artistic. But, sadly that i only drink coffee sachet.. 😥😥😥
Wait, is the water cold when you pour?
it was more peaceful without 🎶 music
The original asmr.
Aesthetically very pleasing, but there is one thing I strongly dislike: I can't sip that delicious looking coffee creation you made.
Vietnam ❤️❤️❤️
Sublime ^^
I’ve seen so much hustle for coffee before pop
I find that coffee taste the best around the 3rd day of resting after roast.
I can smell ur kitchen from Chicago
i have been thoroughly roasted
This man makes his coffee in the most extra ways possible and I love it.
Soo satisfying to watch!
i miss your videos so much! They always bring peace to me
it was so good until you added the almond milk :<
It's really nice to use the traditional tools instead of the modern machines!
I'm not coffee addict but man your coffee making rituals are relaxing lol.
4k resolution, thats how things should be.
Great start to my morning! Thanks!
Great video taking techniques combined with great processing techniques from green beans become a glass of pleasure.
The most delicious ASMR ever seen
MORE TEA VIDEOS PLS YES THANKYOU
The choice of almond milk👍👍👍
4:00 the most satisfying sound of the video.
美味しそう(´˘`＊)
you broke my heart
Beautiful ur video.. relax tq
I don't really like the aspect ratio
Would love to know where I could grab a little roaster like the one you use
يا غرامك 😋😍
I hope that coffee taste as good as this video was ;)
You used cold water for  brewing??? Gotta try this now
It made me miss my favourite vegan cafe in Jogjakarta that I love to visit and work back in the day :(
who ever disliked this video, clearly does not understand the meaning of life. In these desperate times of brexit, this is what I need.
Love how you make these videos ❤️
Hi... Your sound effect on your video very good. Can you tutor me ? :D
I'd loved watching your videos for a long time now, but sometimes videos like this make me wonder about the impact about single-use plastics in our everyday lives. I noticed that your beans are all in plastic bags, is this something that's common in Japan? Just curious if you've tried to reduce your carbon footprint.


Keep making amazing videos - it's just something to consider
おぉ！？

最初にアップルのCM出なかった…
That coffee is so burnt :(
Like aeropress but high pressure
If I only could make this in less than 5 minutes I would drink only this all day
Can you do a Turkish or Egyptian coffee episode? Please?
A bag from  Tanzania 🇹🇿, Yay!
going to sleeppp   zZZ
Vietnamese flag on the bags :) By the way, you did a nice and delicious drink
This video has some nice asmr effects.
Friend:So what do you do for a living.
Peaceful Cuisine: I cook foods?
Friend:...and?
Peaceful Cuisine:A million people wanna break into my home and marry me?
Just start to open the damn coffee shop
this makes starbucks look like amateur hour.
If my coffee took 8:29, and if it costs below $8. Id be going to your shop everyday of the week as long as it looked like that
So relaxing... 👌😌😊😁
This made me feel anxious, for some reason.
I'm so in love with this channel
Whats the backround song called?😍 My shazam wont recognize it :(
Why go through all that trouble of preparing such wonderful coffee and ruining it with almond milk?
I am never taking coffee for granted ever again.
oh nah, this too much work to make a latte. 😂
Your videos are so beautiful
What kind of sweetener you are using?
I could do this but have to leave my job and become youtuber... Meh.
Where is the Brazilian coffee?
Te veo desde Perú 🇵🇪
Lol. I'm not a coffee lover. I love the taste but the side effect of caffeine hurt me so bad. That's why I just realised that coffee beans was green before gettinf roast. I thought it original color was black 😂😂😂
The best ritual for the morning's.
I love the way you shoot your videos , I love your concept of without music and with music concept , love your color grade , love your camera angels , love the texture of your tables , You are a pro cinematographer and editor, you are a awesome photographer . but I miss your old kitchen :(   I always enjoy your videos , to be very honest I have subscribed you with all my gmail ids 😀😀
love all your videos they give me peace especially coffee videos, as I am a great coffee lover I love how much you put work into making your videos that is pleasurable for the viewers' eyes  😊
honestly i would fall asleep in the morning if i have to go through all this process, i get up, put my water to boil go to the bathroom, return and just pour the water on my coffee, simple as that..
We can extract crema layer even with cold water?
i like watching these videos cause this is the shit i don't have time for might as well get some sort of satisfaction from it lol
You are amazing
Wow I would really like to taste coffee made from scratch. Looks awesome.
Or skip all the hassle, go to your nearest cafe
i see Vietnam :)))))
And here I am... drinking canned coffee from a vending machine...
MAGNIFIQUE
I don't know why but the music made me cry
Coffee của Việt Nam kìa, tự hào quá. Việt Nam đứng thứ 2 thế giới về xuất khẩu càfê đấy
Ps video của bạn thật tuyệt.
i would love this without the music as asmr
Would love to visit your cafe / restaurant / whatever place someday in life. Where is it please have some.
Did you let beans rest after it’s been roasted? And for how long before it can be used?
Love your videos. Thank you!
amazing video, as always 🥰
aint nobody got time for that
And I thought I was extra cause I use a french press... 👀👀
Was that pressed with boiled water or room temp water?
Way to ruin a good cup of coffee.
then imma drink it for 30 secs
费了死劲儿喝一杯
Looking for another Vietnamese 🙌🙌
Ok YouTube , I watched it.
Imagine doning this every morning
The music made my heart feel filled with void  a weird empty  yet filling feeling the power of music
How does it taste? What's the temperature of the water?
Beautiful 👏☺️💗
I feel a little silly that I didn't know that coffee beans weren't already brown, but at least I had this video to teach me!
your videos make me so happy
i have that same straw <3
Wonderful video as always 🙌
I love how you used a metal straw ❤🐢
this video is so peaceful.
Abang Ryoya membuat ribet itu jd indah. ❤️

I dont drink coffee but i'd make an exeception for this one.

I just want to play Stardew Valley now
Peruvian coffee 😎
It's so soothing
How long do you need to grind the bean manually to the espresso ground size?
Omg, what I’d do to try this right now 😂
LOL all that trouble but then you add sugar and almond milk. Weak...
Yes, thats my country indonesia,
dream kitchen . I love it
I couldn't help but take a deep breath when he laid the cooked coffee. Totally forgot i was only watching..
like... can you not do this outside?
Great Video! Can you please tell me what kind of coffee are you using? I thought that it was a Kinu M47 but it’s not. Thanks in advance.
このアーモンドミルクはアーモンドの他にpH調整剤、増粘剤(ジェラン)が添加されていますが気にならないですか？
Hi!Beautiful video as usual , did you use cold water for the shot?
Wow.. ❤️
The coffee will taste much better after the beans have time to de-gas.
良い動画だなー。
それにしても水でエスプレッソ作るんですね。そのまま飲むとどんな感じなんだろ、美味しいのかな？？
Where can I buy that all instruments, I like the way it is prepared
Dang ur ice cube thingos are cool
You should let your freshly roasted coffee beans dry for 2/3 days so all the co2 escapes after roasting cause it will be fizzy when consuming it otherwise.
How do I get this roaster in the US?
Really peaceful indeed. loved it.
The people who disliked clearly haven't had enough coffee yet today...
I wish I could only have a sip. awesome video!
perfection
心が落ち着く動画をいつもありがとうございます😊目も耳も癒されてます😊🍀

Calming and tempting. Watching from Trinidad and Tobago  (the Caribbean)
How can you tell which ones to remove from the pile?
Never knew the difference between what's been taken out and what's been left in...
This is why I love Japanese you tuber, compare to Americans, they feel that they have to talk as much to prove they are worthy of watching.
You should make a behind the scenes video with your equipment tripods  tricks etc. I’d love to learn from you how to achieve these beautiful videos!
wow, coffee from indonesia?
Exellent ❤️

That is a peaceful recipe or something?
is the last plastic bag in the video, coffee beans from Indonesia?
That was interesting. I've never seen anyone roast their own coffee beans before.
Peaceful Cuisineさん！この作り方のヴィデオは最高です．いつも次のヴィデオは楽しみにします．お疲れ様でした！
How do you spot a bad coffee bean?
更新頻度！
Gigihnya demi nikmati rasa yg enak! 👍👍
He should of let the beans sit approximately 7 to 10 days based on the roast and containment. This is where flavor further develops as well as some other chemical processes. His espresso most likely had a very generic or unfulfilled flavor profile. But I was pleased with the aesthetics.
Hello come to indonesia.  You can make your coffe right at coffe plantation here.  Salam from kintamani Bali, indonesia
You forgot to show how you went up the fuji to get the spring water.
When you say "cold pressed" do you mean that this espresso was pulled with cold water?  I didn't know that would even work...
This just made me smile
enjoy your life
I think this guy likes coffee
あなたのビデオが好きです

This is just so peaceful. Used to drink 7-8 cups of black coffee for the last two years. Now, I drink once a week roughly
All that to turn it in a coffee with a lot of milk and sugar?
wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much work...I'll take my Kcup!

I swear I could smell the coffee when he plunged it !

Reminds me so much of Tokyo ghoul, so beautiful 💖
Use headphone, asmr'ish
I don't need fancy tools to make a cup of good latte. Just saying.
wow  isee vietnamese coffee
Mendamaikan seperti selalu.
Is the KeepKup worth it? I was thinking about buying one.
りょーやさんハートくださいー！
And here I thought my coffee game was good ...
Mucho kilombo para hacer un café,yo agarro una taza, media cucharada de café  una y media de azúcar un chorrito de agua caliente lo bato para que tenga espuma y ya esta ,queda re piola
a little disappointed you didn't harvest the  beans first
I'm peaceful now hehehe
That was cold water?
Man, you really have very low morals to work with iherb. They are just scammers and i should have known better.
Two hours later 7:59
That is Bean from indonesia ?
The aroma 😍

you forgot to clean all the elements in use .....
I love you
Can this be anymore relaxing than this?
香りがしてきそうな(*´-`)

He finally bought a funnel!
What's the size of the Keep Cup you're using?
I want that metal straw!
楽しそう〜
This guy is a different breed
Sheesh let that coffee rest. Better flavor comes if it matures for a week or two after roasting.
does all that extra effort really make it taste better tho
Nice to see the peruvian flag on your videos. Like si eres peruano y viste este video.
Mesmerising 💚
This is sooo wonderful to watch.
I feel happy now!
今日も優雅な時間をありがとうございました🙌
That's what a call MANUAL
How does cold pressed espresso taste compared to regular espresso?
コーヒーを1日、どれくらい飲んでるんです？
wouldnt it be funny if at the very end you hear him unzip his pants and he just pisses into it
Where do I buy that coffee? Is there a coffee shop that does that coffee? It looks so yummy with all the almond milk!!!
I just wandering is that hot or cold water when u make espresso? And one more.. Please make more about coffee
Njay, cuma buang bijinya aja udh durasi 😂
how does he make everyone so calm just making coffee
Its too erotic.
nice you guys also use stainless steel drinking straws ^_^
dah gitu tumpah ae anying HAHAHA
Burnt =(
that was therapeutic
AFAIK the beans should rest for atleast 1w after getting roasted, they release gases after getting roasted that gives them a kinda papery / cardboard taste if you don't let them rest
so good
This is so cute
So soothing like OMG
全手動濃縮咖啡哈哈哈
7:22 Is that olive oil ? (from Morocco)
Eh? Since when this channel use music?

Love the video, can't wait to try this out! ♡

@evecornnwell
This reminds me of the princess bride for some reason

一つ一つの音がすき
I have no Idea, why i am here and still watched the hole thing
That is a black gold  Wow . Thank you
The taste is more stable and delicious if placed for 3 days than freshly brewed coffee beans.
where is the cup from!??! its so cute!
expected more, but not bad, would have at least foamed the milk a bit like in the greek frappes
Good old GRINDER.
What's the instruments name ??? Plzs someone tell
Most aesthetically pleasing channel.
So coffee beans are not black since the beginning?
te amo
I don't even use the internet but I am watching the entire video.

Wow 😍
what do you look for when picking out the bad beans?
♥️
look nice
im still sucking that iron straw from my screen, but cant even taste it
great video 👍🏻💙
get a real roaster
All that work is put into the beans and espresso...but it takes so long to rearrange your camera the shot is dead by the time you start mixing it.
:)
Where did you get that manual roaster from?
does anyone know where can i find that glass?
I want that cup
Lindo
대박입니다~^^
スタバのcold pressed espressoはただの水出しコーヒーだったが、これは文字通りの水出しエスプレッソ。ただ水なので濃い味がでないのではないかと思ってしまうのですが、ラテにしてどんな味になってるんでしょうか？動画のフレアエスプレッソに圧力計がついてますが圧はどれぐらいかけたら落ちるのですか？よろしけれは教えていただけませんでしょうか。
That roasting tools are interesting. Anyone know what is it call?
Great video. However, freshly roasted coffee should rest for a few days before use. It tastes better.
I’m in love

I like your tools
Indonesian coffee beans?
美味しそうですね！いいですね！エスプレッソ器具欲しくなっちゃた!それと、筑波さんのアーモンドミルクですが、注ぎ口から液ハネしませんか？僕は、キッコウマンの豆乳に付いているプラスチックの注ぎ口を利用してます。お試しあれ！
Selling Vietnam coffee here. Hit me up if anyone want some artisan coffee. We have bean, ground and drip bag. :D
Way too complicate
U r great

Does Flair Espresso ship internationally? This espressomaker seems awesome!
Indonesia anyone?
I bet it smells divine in there
What beans are you using?
How are the shots?

HAH MILK? HAH sweetener?? - overproud people that drink coffe for style
見える！たくさんのお金！
those beans are burnt
What's with the almond milk? Use cow milk like a normal human being goddamit.
Coffee is linked to cancer.
Awsome
wow, so much work and mess to make a coffee 👌🏼👍🏻 .... i am even too lazy to clean my nespresso machine 🤣  and i would for sure miss the right time to stop during the roasting process 😬😱
Im the only one that feels that the milk ruined the coffee?


If you are going to make an iced latte, its better to add cold milk first and then the ice so that you dont melt the ice.
Délicieuse vidéo. Merci
V;)
What cup is that? Looks nice
すごく美味しそうです。今回はどこの豆のブレンドですか？それとアーモンドミルク は香ばしローストかほんのり黒糖入りか気になります。
does cold pressed mean you use cold water
Try to put the hot roasted coffee beans in large closed glass container bear heat to keep the volatile oils until it cold
Precioso video de postureo, porque es inutil hasta decir basta. A la maquina de presión esa le doy 10 usos como mucho, antes de que se le joda algo.
Hello Ryoya! You are a real barista! How long does it take to roast the green beans? 🇩🇪❤️🇯🇵
I love sound of the video.
I need help for a Design Graphic's Project. Does somebody talk Japanese ? I need to translate English or French word into correct Japanese mean.
すごく、美味しそうですね！
やっぱりコールドプレスでの製法は、コーヒー豆でも旨みとか、深みが違うのでしょうか。。
果物と、野菜のプレス機械はりょうやさんの動画を見てすごく感動しました！
余すところなく、果物や野菜の栄養素を壊すことなく頂けるし、身体に与える影響も違うんでしょうね。私は低速ジューサーで満足していましたが、あの機械を見たら、欲しくなっちゃいました(^^)
いつも、素晴らしい料理や用品を紹介してくれるりょうやさんの動画は、私にとって宝物になりました！
ありがとう！！
这么做咖啡吧。就是一个纯玩。折腾这么半天，再不好喝的咖啡自己也会觉得好喝。毕竟这么费工夫呢！
噱头！还不就这么回事儿！
FANTASTIC! Next video is where glass is melted first to produce a glass, then forging an iron pipe with a blacksmith. OH MY!
vibes.
I feel like i could smell it through this video
Is that Indonesian beans?
Nice short movie
This is what’s possible when you don’t have kids.
Does anyone else feel like they should be crying
Wow
Yummm first
Why do you place a wood slab over the stove when you roast your beans
Hi.. Thank you for it.. What device did yoy use to make cold press, if i may ask.
do you milk your almonds?
It's price over $300. Too much expensive.
How do you tell which bean is not good enough, and have to taken out from the batch?
I have a bizarre question to the person who participates in the video: do you know any Bulgarian ? Because the bracelet ( red and white) is a Bulgarian bracelet we wear in spring :)
コーヒーロースター機どこか？私知らせてくださいここ韓国では李スペックであるアリがまた
Very nice 👌
did you use room temperature water to brew the coffee?? how does it taste compared to normal espresso?
I have seen some posts asking about the coffee roaster used in this beautiful video. Here’s the link to the manufacturer. If you scroll down the page you will see in English that unfortunately the manufacturer says they will not ship this item outside Japan. They will also not sell to third party shippers in Japan who ship outside Japan. I do not understand their reason and it was not explained. But that’s what I’ve found and thought I would share. I would certainly be interested in purchasing one of these if someone can find a reliable method. 
Btw, how do u know when the roaster part is done?
I want your whole set of equipment =/
おぉ！美味しそう♪
お水で出して薄いとかはないのですか？
これからはアイスが美味しい季節ですね！りょうやさんの作るダッチコーヒーとかも観てみたいです^_^
where do you get so many different kind of coffee beans ?
氷は透明なやつの方がいいですよ
How long usually does it take to roast coffee beans? Anyone?
you should open a cafe. right now. this instAnT. PleAsE. i will fly to JAPAN FOR IT.
how does this roast taste cold pressed vs normal espresso ? I tried to google this and got lots of comments on cold brewed but not so much on this cold pressed method.
Looks like a huge pain
Where do you buy those green beans?
The music isn’t necessarily
He used almond milk. Has anyone tried it before? Like, which one tastes better: with cow's milk or almond milk?
So basically the difference between this video and the other one is that here... You added milk...
Can some of you guys tell me what the taste difference between cold-pressed and "normal" coffe is? Is there even any? This looks freaking delicious and my grandmother still has a similiar press and I am really considering asking her to borrow it to me.
その冷たい水ですか?
Is that using cold / room temp water?
Very nice video looks awesome
I found my religion
This video annoys me..
what’s the exact point of cold „brewed“ ice coffee? (since the beans were roasted anyways) 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️

I do the same with my nespresso machine. And it takes much much less coffee. About 4-5 grams. I press it into a reusable stainless steel capsule, make some hot coffee, add huge ice cubes and oat milk. Done . Ur way seems to require more than 10g of ground coffee? for a single small serving. ?
以前料理動画の撮影方法の説明の際にはカメラ1台で撮影されていましたが、今も一台なのでしょうか？
Whats the difference between this flair espresso press and the other bigger press? 

And whats the difference between the machine grinder and hand grinder?
hii
I wonder what camera he or she uses?
What glass is that at the end? Anyone know?
Is it healthier this way?
Very good video!!!
I heard that it is good for the taste to let the beans rest after the roasting in between 7 to 14 days....What do you think?
こんばんは！
コーヒー動画待っておりました✨
今回も素敵ですねー(*´∇｀*)
そして実は私も今日8coffee roastから豆が届いたんですが、ンゴロンゴロをいつも買っているので、りょうやさんも買ってて驚きでした！！✨
最近のコーヒー豆のお気に入りはなんですか⁇
うちではやはりマチュピチュ天空が1番で(*´-`)
Did you wait a few days for the beans to degas after roasting? For espresso beans it takes a few days to degas for optimal aromatics. Just thought it’s good information for viewers ;)
notice the new wrist band on your right hand, are you religious? specifically buddhist or taoist?
Really enjoy this video, I wanna make my coffee after watch it
Isn't butane going to leave a taste or smell on the beans?
200$
Damn.
How much dishes did you have to do for that small cup of coffee?
Almond milk???
Just use normal milk dude!
水？？？
いつも？使ってらっしゃる機器
と今回の機器は コーヒーの風味
違いはありますか？
Not really relaxing asmr
I saw you are using Indonesian coffee. How its taste my friend?
I don't drink tea or coffee, I do cocaine. However this video was very relaxing 👍🏼
Is anybody skip to the press part?🤔
What's the point of making coldpressed espresso if you gonna dilute it with ice cubes anyway, smh. It will taste watery unless you drink it right away, all at once
ただ作ってるだけじゃん
Please don't use music the next time. It's really quality ASMR content without it.
Coffee 😍😍😍 please don't use music is taking away the whole experience of your videos 🙏
So much work and equipment just for coffee....
this is the most hipster thing I've seen in my life :O
Imagine going through this whole video just to see they poured Almond Milk in the end
手間と音に 気持ちが豊かになります。
ストローが気になりました。
使いごごちなどを教えていただけませんか？☺
All that work for two-maybe three sips of coffee? No thanks haha
Boring 😔😔😔😔
is he gay?
this is actually the normal way of making yourself a cup of coffee .... sadly most of us (me included) do not have few hours in the morning for this and would just grab an instant pack mix hot water, the Lazier one would fork out extra cash for a store or chain bought one.
Starbucks is a big NO, an over priced junk drink.
Too much work!!
Cool video but that is way too much time spent on a single cup of coffee
Roasting beans with gas isn't dangerous for health ? I think beans absorbe gas am i wrong ?
Tip: Watch on 2.0x speed and then write to YouTube asking for a 3.0x speed just for this video
Ruined from the moment he added the sweetener up until the end...
19k Hipsters and vegans like this video :B
Too too much complicated process, I still like my IKAWA pro with my Lamarzocco GS3 and Ditting Peak Grinder , so easy to extract
I thought it was legit a new brewing method, but this ain’t cold pressed.
I always prefer [No Music] hit like if you do the same
For a split second, I could smell the coffee beans 😂 

Is it just me?...
Thank god for these videos when I can’t sleep at odd hours
I would pay so much to drink one of your drinks or eat one of your foods. I think it would be totally worth the love and effort that goes into it.
Imagine living next door to this guy ... the aromas!!
i have BEAN blessed
everyone talking about the camera angles
and yes
but
the audio tho
theSE CAMERA ANGLES ARE TOO GOOD
you could have told me that contraption was a fancy microscope and i would have believed you, i love all the equipment he uses for his videos honestly.
Y’all click on his video fast don’t you 😉
No music videos are better❤️❤️❤️
I worked as a barista for almost 6 years, and I had no idea you could press espresso with cold water.
The tools and techniques you use are simply beautiful!
Aweee...can u imagine how good tht would smell?!
perfect timing, couldn’t sleep and this is exactly what i need ❤️
very satisfying to watch! i can imagine the smell of roasted coffee beans
Hey, just watched your bubble tea video from 2015 and then saw this one, love that you're using metal straws now! i love your vids, keep going!
The only thing I hav for this recipe is water😂😂😂😂😂😂
My favourite guy 💞 love from UK 🇬🇧💖😘
I wonder how many cameras were set to get all that perfect angles! 
Your video is aesthetic as always 👍👍
Thank you so mach for all of your video:) especially for the dumpling video,I tried it and totally in love with them^^
I watched this 2 mins and I just woke up from an involuntary 3 hour nap
I just saw Vietnamese coffee right?
This is so peaceful, you chose the absolute perfect name and content. ♥️
also, was that a reusable straw at the end of the video?! wow
Do you know what colour's coffee bean?
Black
No! They're green!!!!!! Surprise!
wow it actually creates the three layers of espresso :o i want one now.
You're videos could bring world peace if everyone  just watches them. 😭😭😭 Simply delightful Ryoya-san!
Honestly, just want to let you know that you are amazing, and your content is great, and you are very appreciated. Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
The passion that goes into his craft is absolutely astounding.💕
I can’t wait to watch this video~~~😍
love from India. I was curious how much one cup of latte would cost?
I’m thinking that your home must smell amazing after roasting coffee :)
Always love your videos 😎
Thank you 🙏
いつか、おじいちゃんになったら、カフェ☕️を開いて欲しいな😌🌸🍀✨✨✨
i like how you use metal straws ^_^
りょうやさんのお部屋紹介とかキッチンツアーまた見たいな🥰
最近また動画多くなって嬉しいです😆🧡
Damn, for a second I thought the title was How to make cold depressed ice latte.

Looks like I’ll be visiting my therapist again.
Normaly you should wait 1..2 weeks after roasting...
Thank you for making the no music versions of your videos. I think that more people should do the same.
Thank you
☼ oooooh, your videos are delicious. It's a sweet, peaceful pleasure to watch them. And, all your vegan cuisine ! The heaven for me ! ♥ ♥ <3 Thank you so much ! I'm so happy to see someone interested in so many activities ! Video making, photos, cuisine, coffee, baking, manual activities ! Thank you so much !
This is so satisfying! Lots of love from Malaysia 🇲🇾
@PeacefulCuisine
The coffee roaster is only available in Japan. Would you be willing to ship the roaster to the US?
Oh yes, yes this is definitely the YouTube I signed up for
Yesterday I found this guy and I was too Tired to comment on the video cause I didn't want to be blasted with the white from the YouTube app, but now that I'm awake, thank you for making my sleeping better. Now I actually want to sleep 💝
I never imagined coffee could be so complicated.
Beautiful and satisfying videos as always, have been subscribing to your channel for almost 2 years.

A little advice for your Flair, the main chassis is not securely sit on the base, I saw some 2-3 mm gap, you might need to loosen up the bolt a bit then fix the chassis sitting on the base chassis.
I'm afraid you could found some trouble when pressing a very fine grind coffee, it might snapped if not securely sit on the base.
How much time do you give the beans from roasting to de-gas? I heard you're supposed to give them a while.. like at least a full day. But it seems like you use them as soon as they're cooled down
We know it's maple syrup! 😂💕💕
This have BEAN an amazing experience <3 Thank you!
thanks MR because after  buy coffe form indonesia...😁....sorry if my speak english  bad
I love your coffee setup so much😍
Omg I'm so glad you're posting again!  Please post hundreds of these no music videos they're incredible xxx
A precious shot of coffee like that.. I'D DRINK IT BLACK omg
コーヒーの香りがしてきそうです(*´ω｀*)コップもストローも素敵です✨
Peruvian coffee beans! 😊 Great video as always
豆の種類がハンパないですね☆1番どれがお好みですか？＾＾
I always watch these before I go to bed and it’s just so calming and nice, and I can actually get good sleep. Spring break is tomorrow at least.

I clicked all the [No Music] uploads.
Im craving coffee at 2:30am in the morning... thanks 😂.
Enjoy your overpriced tasteless Starbucks comment section :D
So THIS is how freshly hand-made coffee was made.. beautiful...
Indonesia have the best coffee in the world. The most expensive one in Starbucks. Luwak Coffee
はぁー好き
Omg are those coffee beans from Vietnam :))))) love your videos!!!!
they are so calming, and help me sleep every night!
Thanks for uploading one without music! I love it
He's using reusable straws, YES
Another masterpiece 🌸☕️ Thank you!
One of the top I've ever seen. You are awesome.
So not the same as instant coffee in my thermos to be gulped down on my way to work...
Love the video
Such venerable craftsmanship🙌🏻 I'd probably archive this satisfying coffee preparation for posterity instead of consuming it 🙏🏻❤️
I feel like I'm watching a very relaxing mad scientist! 🤣
Thank you so much for making these no music versions I love them a lot!!!
I feel like I can smell the coffee beans.
Your videos are so relaxing!
lmao imagine not having spherical ice cubes
Love how detailed your recipes are, I actually make them at home and it inspires me a lot!
Thank you so much for this beautiful work of art
The quality of this video, damn !!
OMG!!! I literally sat here wanting everything you used! That was so cool to see.
Well, THIS is real coffee ritual! #coffeeloversunited
Everything sounds perfect in your videos
Thus so satisfying  so relaxing  . I'm gonna subscribe
And your espresso machine 😍
I feel like such a slob using instant coffee now.... 😂
Damn relaxing, I really love your videos♡
It must be delicious ice latte. 😍😋😋😋
Sorry for my poor language. :D
Any way to get that coffee roaster shipped to Canada?
That's okay, but from where do I get these pieces of equipment from 😅
Life would be complete if i have coffee like this everyday ❤️❤️
Thanks for uploading both music and no music versions. You are a god.
Hello, Ryoya, I would recommend pulling the shot of espresso directly over ice. It will preserve the shot and the flavor will be more pronounced.
I didn't know coffee beans popped like popcorn when you roasted them 😆
Roses are Red 
Grasses are Green
A new video has come from Peaceful Cuisine!
It's 4:06 A.M, I hear birds...oh no...
P E A K A E S T H E T I C S
yeah boi metal straws!!! Save the turtles!
最近また動画沢山出してもらえて嬉しいです！
I'm surprised you don't GROW the coffee first - otherwise, great videos.
Quiero tener la paciencia de este chabon para hacer café
I don't drink coffee but this is beautiful!!
These videos totally remind me of those PES cooking animations, but, you know... with real food. They both have that wonderful audio and really entrancing visuals.
その冷たい水ですか？
Is that using cold water?
You can turn anything into a dying last meal or drink I swear. I need some 😭❤️
Wow that was suprising very relaxing ☺
ur cinematography deserves an oscar
Glad you are back. You been away.
amazingly awesome vid...less is more right there!
who came from the Bubble Tea video?
I love coffee ☕️ and this channel ⭐️
Emma Chamberlain could never
That is the creamiest looking almond milk I've ever seen! Where can I buy it?!
You should seriously direct the cinematography for films because your cuts and angles are absolutely phenomenal
When you like the video before it even starts. You know it's going to be excellent as always.
Coffee without sugar = caffeinated phenyl
Vietnamese coffee ... It seems you like arabica more than robusta.  How is your mixing ratio?
suddenly i feel like craving for it right now
Yay Peruvian coffee!!!!!
This channel is all about “how to’s”, but secretly, it’s an ASMR channel, not just because of the sounds, but the camera angle’s too.
these videos are my absolute favorites. the peace that they radiate reminds me of cooking with my grandma or those small coffee shops you go to in a foreign place that make you feel at home
The best kind of Asmr 💜
Love this. Wonder how it would be with coffee ice.
four minutes in
shows first ingredient
It was weirdly exciting that I got recommendations in English and Japanese versions. I watched the English first....
Anybody know how I can get the coffee roaster from this videos I clicked on the link and the site said they don’t ship to the US.
The smell in that kitchen is probably amazing
So relaxing to watch 😌
My birds loves the sound of the beans against the containers, they started singing along in a way
Every one of your food videos is a treat. I wish you could make them more often! Love and respect from the US
I think i'm in love with you.
I feel poor whenever I watch peaceful cuisine 😂😂
I love you videos. Thank you so much for making these. Do you think you would ever make a guide to eating vegan in different parts of Japan? It would be nice to get a local’s advice.
(◡‿◡✿) beautiful
Love that you are using metal straw
emma chamberlain is shaking
Love watching your coffee drink videos
The manual roasting machine is so cute. Where did you get it?
Coffee ice cubes take cold coffee drinks over the top!!!
Thank you for making this kind of video, no any kind of music background but just a pure sound of the products and the things in the kitchen and especially the video is direct to the point! No more shitty long intro’s and whatsoever. Thank you! ❤️ You agree with me? 😂
Love the passion behind your work 👌🏻 you should let the beans de-gas and let off some carbon dioxide after roasting before using them to make coffee and you will taste a huge difference. Dark roasts like these de-gas much faster than light ones and should be amazing after about five days as a generalisation
I've just realized that this is an ASMR channel before it was cool
I feel like you’re the only person that’s about to go through that many steps for an iced latte but that makes me respect you so much
looks delicious! I wish I lived near-by you so that I could taste all the things you make
This was so so so satisfying to watch. God I love fresh espresso  and coffee !!!
i could swear i smelt the roasted coffee beans
I can't believe how satisfying that was to watch.
Best thing ever to wake up to
0:19  
I didn't know Poland exported koffee.
honestly just what i needed right now, this makes me relax hella
I think I saw Vietnamese flags 😱😱😱
These videos always look like very long cooking scenes from a movie. Loving it!
I recently started a new youtube cooking channel and would like to be this good of video maker/editor and have that great attention to detail. your videos are nothing short of perfection.
Hello greetings from Egypt you're providing amazing content If you don't mind me asking what kind of microphone are using 👍👍
He roasted his own coffee... god teir
This is one of the best videos I see ever on Internet. Your work is really amazing. This is the best way to make me do my coffee in my Chemex. Now I want your cold press machine, I need to try. Thanks for content like this. 👌🏻
amazing <3 looks so good
This looks like the best cup of coffee.
Imagine being that one person disliking such a beautiful video.
May I ask why you brew right after you roast the coffee bean? Should you wait for the "degas" phase is over?
Hehe, very nice but I think i would skip roasting my own beans :)
That's a lot of work to go to to drown a coffee in almond milk
This video explains coffee is ART
just add vodka and you'll have "white russian" instead
Oh my God! Been watching you for years and this is the first time seeing a Vietnamese trait on your channel. I was really surprise
I would sell a kidney to just meet you and eat and drink those delicious foods I mean come on.. The love and effort you put in this is amazing bravo 👏
You are the Latte of my life ;)
Where did you buy the coffee roaster?
What a cup of happiness looks like! I miss watching my grandma roasting coffee beans in our back yard as a kid. I could only imagine what amazing scent must have enveloped your home! Thank you for sharing. :)
his hands. I'm in love with them
What coffee beans did you use?
Nothing can beat the boba video though.
I swear I can smell this video
Lowkey ASMR
Hi.I am from Greece.Why you dessapear?
Looks like i'm late,haha
I love this channel
0:12 That coffee from Vietnam.
Indonesian coffee FTW ☕
More coffee videos! Thanks
Emma chamberlain is quaking
I always liked the looks on Flair Espresso Maker. I really wish i can get my hands on one of them soon.
Is it me or was this music to the ears
The best ASMR
my ears have BEAN blessed 😌
after the video on the main channel, I always check your personal channel hoping to see more of your kitchen
Oof I'm inspired
You are brilliant
8mins of goodness
I hate coffee, why am I even here? And watched the whole thing too
these videos help me fall asleep at night. thank you
Ahh if only I could afford all that equipment and ingredients to make such an exquisite iced latte
Watching a peaceful video at 1am is so relaxing
Are you mixed balinese?
NO MUSIC！THANK YOU ♥
As a fellow coffee lover, I'm so glad to be born in Indonesia. The coffee here is great!
Love from me and my little brother from Thailand 💞
calms my soul
It looks like all the syrup is still sitting in the bottom of the cup at the end? Maybe it it supposed to? Anyways, an awesome video nonetheless! Thanks for making it!
this is.....Art
THANK YOU.
That's  a new coffee press machine.. What happened to the old one?
Thanks for video. Love from Turkey.
probably the best coffee ever
Vids that u can smell 😍
I challenge u to make my country’s tradisional food!!! — Nasi Lemak from Malaysia 🇲🇾🤪
THIS IS VEGAN PROPOGANDA!!!!!! D:<<
Great video! Did you use cold water to make the espresso?
So interesting! I love your channel!
I’ve been waiting
Watching the coffee drip slowly out into the cup is oddly satisfying...
Better than any ASMR
I like the sounds without music it makes me feel sleepy
旨みが詰まった、ちょびっと...なのですね
(リキッドタイプのコーヒー思い出す...）
Did u use coffee beans from indonesia?
Its crazy how much coffee powder needed to make that amount of coffee drink.
Coffee from Perú c:
Ryoya, could you please comment on the taste/flavor compared to the same drink with hot espresso?
Where can I buy that cup 😭
I love coffee
Love this video 😍😍😍
that's indonesian coffee bean that you chose?
the best asmr video
How are you enjoying the espresso press so far? Very tempted to get one myself...
Peaceful ❤️
i am sitting here drinking my coffee made from powder, wishing i could afford to go to a real cafe and drink some good coffee. #studentlife
Do you also have the tradition with this red-white bracelet every March..?
Has anyone been able to find that coffee roaster for sale to the US? I can’t find a retailer for it. :(
Wow, this is art!
Look at the crema on that espresso!  amazing
i don’t even have enough forks while this guy over here could open a semi antique store dedicated to only kitchen utensils
Starbucks is shook
I'm not an expert with coffee, but do the bad beans change the flavor by a lot?
Great video to start the day to.
What I love about this channel is that he does everything from scratch like it’s supposed to be
What’s the temperature of the water in this cold brew?
I am hungry for coffee now :(
Patience level 1000
Vietnam coffee is the best ! =))
All I need now is $500 worth of equipment.
I like Indonesian foods 😍😘👍
With almond milk? brrrr
morning routine
MEH FIRST
Just perfect!
Hiya Baby 💞💕💋😘
It so satisfying.
When you are about to leave in a hurry, but you desperately need your coffee shot...
Indonesian coffee
I wish Ryoya was my neighbor so I could smell fresh roasted coffee while I drank my crap from Keurig.
いち！
I wish i had this much time making coffee
C R A F T S M A N S H I P
Why I'm  not surprised when he uses a metal straw ?
morning after taco bell 6:07
First view 😩👌
Isn't it a little odd to drink your coffee right after grinding it? It should off-gas for a couple days usually. I wonder how it tastes? Cool video though.
The crema!! Sooo perfeeect
kopi indonesiaa
This is pure asmr.
Are you wearing a Marti ?
Might look good with those perfectly done filmography, but that kind of coffee will never work.
🖤
starbucks has left the chat
Indonesia 🙌🙌
Dat late probably cost like 2k to make. Dang
ひとつひとつが丁寧......テスト前にノート借りたらめちゃくちゃ重宝しそう
This was sooo cool.
お店出して欲しい
i think i recognize that balinese bracelet
3:48 where can I buy that is similar to that machine?
Woah!
😍❤️
did you move to new house?
siiip
I wish I could smell this video 👃🏽
That’s a bit too much milk lmao
Eargasm
Mantap.
Where i could buy one of those coffee roasters, the link is only available to japan area. All of local stores here only has big drum coffee roasters.
What kind of sweetener is that?
😍😍😍
Is this asmr?
Is this ASMR?
what was he doing at the beginning when he took some of the beans out?
ストローとグラスはどこのものですか？(o^^o)
This filter❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍☕️💛💛
I wish I was this thorough with my life
This is it. This is what I want to do with my life.
How long would it take to completely roast the beans?
NICE
Coffe Viet nam 🇻🇳
Without music is better
Why did he pull out some beans?
really cool!
いつの間にか、海外の方が増えているなあ…
What sort of a kettle is that?
アーオイシソ
👍👍
I haven't slept in two days and this is soothing my exam anxiety.
私はあなたがコーヒー豆を少し軽く焙煎して最初にアイスミルクを入れることができると思いますそしてそれからエスプレッソショットは大理石のようなアイスラテをする
Indonesia :)
Almond milk..... Gay.
❤️❤️
Heaaarteu
Looks yummy!
jeez. I thought i might have  a way to save money by making my iced americanos by myself. Alas, you've invested over $400 in materials. suddenly, $2.75 seems even more reasonable for my daily drink. Thanks for sharing ryoka <3
It's amazing how dedicated you are. I checked out your website, you've inspired me to try out going vegan. I don't know how happy my dog will be to hear that news though...
音楽なしver.で音を聞きながら作業を眺めていると癒されます。しかしコーヒー飲むのってこんな大変だったのですね！
Very nice 👌
Oat milk is a trend now in the US. Have you tired it?
Hello! Do you eat yoghurt?
why is this on my history? did i just fell asleep while watching this? lmao
Which video filter do you use?
Great great great gre— ALMOND MILK?
Cool video but unless you’re allergic don’t ruin such beautiful beans.
did anyone else become upset seeing the kitchen getting dirty????
I know this is a stupid question but is the water hot or normal temperature? just in case I get it wrong
Great video......
Do you own a cafe ?
#Jaw_Drop

That was look sooo tasty... my mouth is watering, hehee
Im so happy you consume one of the coffee from Indonesia 😊😊😊
Boirha lagsi
man this guy is a bit too health conscious
Everything about this video was a yes for me lol
Coffee is going extinct because of climate change :'(
Love this video cuz Peruvian coffee is here
1.Sees video about making milk tea in recommends-nah I know how to make it
2. Accidentally clicks it-OMG THIS IS SO SATISFYING
3. Subscribes and watches all his videos even though I'm not gonna make any of them(except for milk tea, I know how to make that, just not as aesthetically😝)
りょーやさん、こんばんは(^^)
わたくし、先週より人生初めての蕁麻疹になりました。
過度なストレスが身体と心に掛かってたのは自覚はしてたのですが、まさか蕁麻疹になるとは。
介護や仕事や子育てに追われて、身体がサインを出したのだと思い、反省してます。強く見えて実は弱い自分を正直に素直に出せる自分なって、もう少しやわらかく生きられたらと思います。
Jesus, the amount of plastic just for those beans. I'm surprised the ice didn't come wrapped in individual cubes.
Any indian over here? God I wish some one here Indian
what can't you do honestly

Are you just going to leave one of them another colour to the others 😭
Yayyy, I’ve been waiting for another one of these
i wouldn't put a knob on them I like how they look
Tip: Find a man who can cook and build furnitures.
You don't have to fast forward the video because honesly, you can just put  a 24 hours long video and I am sure gonna watch it no matter what :))
you are really skilled! I think the shelves look good how they are now, clean and minimalistic.
あと数年で子供が独立します。体が弱く食事も不自由で息も絶え絶えに生きておりますが、りょうやさんの動画に出会って、食事が楽しみになり、海外やDIYの動画から、第二の人生の目標ができました。
子供が独立したら、住まいをカスタマイズして、自分の好きなものを揃えて、料理をして、海外旅行もしようと思います。

これからも、続けて下さいね。楽しみにしています。

ありがとうございます。
This makes me want to build my own counter for my bookbinding ... with a large top and drawers for supplies underneath. All I need is the space!
I can’t even make a proper paper plane.
Thats a cool refrigerator or am I the only one who thinks that? lol fridge tour??
I love these! I get to learn how to build things because you explain it so well!
りょーやさん！ハート付けて〜
とても素敵な仕上がりになりましたね
お終いの方の疲れと言った時の表情がとても嬉しそうに見えました
これからの動画も楽しみにしています

最後若干投げやりな感じなのも好きです(笑)

If you want to...
Just a suggestion.
Blue Tarp = Confirmed Japanese.

この時を待っておりました。気分が上がって就活頑張れそうです。
私なら、これで完成ってことにしちゃうかも😅 でもこれで終わらないのがリョーヤクオリティですね 完成動画楽しみです！
thank u for another satisfying video!
May I say that i found your videos through an unfortunate event in my life (while I was sick) but you definitely turned that around!  I have been binge watching your videos for two days while bed ridden!   I am a fellow vegan and your videos is calming for the soul!  I cannot wait to try out some of the recipes.  Can you do more traditional japanese vegan recipes please?   More power to your channel!
Finally! Waited for this video for months! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
So what exactly is your profession? You're very talented in everything.
DIY動画楽しみにしてました＾＾手際の良さ素晴らしい！スライドレール気持ち良いですね。

使い勝手の良さそうですね
With the amount of space these drawers provide, I am just imagining how much everything can be neat/organized and it makes me drool.
うーん！超クール😃
For a moment there I thought your voice was a part of the track
I like e way the drawers look now. With the exposed wood box. And the empty gaps for handles
Nice video cuz I'm gonna make my dinning table next week too! Beautiful kitchen! ;)
Thanks for the video! Love the progress.
I hope to watch these videos without subtitles one day. Thanks, りょや さん for this great upload once again!
Wow! Thanks! I was waiting for this :)
Ah! It looks perfect without knobs!
Coming from NJ I just wanted to let it be known They came out AMAZINGLY!!!

大容量で色々入っていいですね(*´ω｀*)最近動画多くてうれしみ♡レシピも多く出してくれるとハイパーうれしみですｗｗ
It’s incredible the amount of things you can do, and there’s this beautiful vibe coming from your fans under every videos of yours.
I like the even profile of the drawers as they are, and they don't need knobs to operate, but I'm looking forward to seeing what you end up doing with them.  Well done on this project; you have many talents!
YYAAAAYYYY!!! i missed your videos
オーストラリアからよろしく〜！凄いビデオだなー
こりゃ大変な作業量だ。お疲れ様です。
I'm glad that you're back
Oo yas! You are so productive. Makes me wanna go seize the day! You should do a Day in my life or a Vlog week. WOULD love to see that.
Ryoya: builds a whole shelf with drawers, everything is neat
Me: makes an origami swan, creates a big mess
DIYまってました！！
You inspire me and wish I was a part of your life!!!
Your videos early in the morning. 😍
Damn why is he so talented.😩 Is there something he cant do?! Whoever gets to be with him needs to realize this dude is a catch
man... you are an inspiration to us all... this kitchen is getting very beautiful
That's some hard labour..
男なら誰でも憧れるであろう木材と鉄脚のキッチンかっこいい！ハンドメイドってのがまたワイルド
待ってました！
DIY久々に見ます❗やっぱり、りょうやさんの動画は気持ち良いですね！上手だし❗
たいへんすごいね!!
Please do a matcha ice cream tutorial without music....
Super !!! 👏👏
んもう！お部屋全体見たいです！
Do a slot/cut-out, not a handle/knob. Anything sticking out could spoil their appearance.
Those are beautiful.
WE MISSED YOU I HOPE YOURE HAPPPYYYYYYYYYYY <3
大容量でかっこいいですね！
京都は夏暑く冬寒いと聞きますが東京と比べていかがですか？
最高の極み
まってましたぁ
Very impressive!
I think You don't need knobs, cause you have enough space between drawers to open them freely, knobs will ruin the current look, which is really good :)
I would love to have a kitchen like this in the future ^^ What about this drawer's lighter front? Are you going to paint it later or just leave as it is? It actually looks interesting ;)
Yyyyaaaaiiiissss betapa gabut nya ane liat ini sampe selesai 😶😶
Where did you buy the iron frames?
かっこいい
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Feeling so summer from your outfit!
that's perfect
Nice work Ryoyan San.
耐荷重ってどれくらいですか？
まってましたーーー！
yay another video !! 😃
The drawer space is impressive.
can you eat those
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Beautiful!
木箱を組み立てる際、底板をつける時に使ったクランプのメーカー教えて頂けますか?
need more of your cooking videos soon or ill die
まってたー
You should get a piece of the exact same wood as the newest drawers and replace the face of the two you had made previously. That probably the only thing I would recommend. Without a face it looks beautiful but the colour difference between the stained woods makes it look disjointed.
they look really good love it
待望のDIY動画ありがとうございます！レール取り付けた引き出し作ってみたくなりました。
完成形はまだ先があるんですね！？
他の動画同様に続きを楽しみに待ってます！
Really amazing your DIY skills. What kind of wood do you use in the majority of you DIY projects, Sugi wood?
あの可愛いい pen!! 前のお家の、DIY動画でも使ってましたよね♪
キッチンツアーをお願いします！
いや〜おしゃれですね！一番左上は塗らないんですか？
Ever wonder where Norm from the Old Yankee Workshop went?
Dude, your house is to die for
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
前からなんで作業台をキッチンから少し離したんやろうと疑問に思ってたんやけど上から撮影するためやったんやね

Is there a specific name for this type of place? Is it an apartment?

Kitchen tour please !!
この木の色好きです。
広い引き出しでいいですね✨
Amazing!
Love it, got a nice sleek look to it.
Your videos inspire me.
ついに来たー
I like your DIY video.
I love them.They look really cool.
WANT WANT WANT
It's been a while
丁寧さが半端ないですね。見ていてとても気持ちがいいです。１発で全部入って垂直で、あぁ〜　たまらないです。これからも頑張ってください!
Why do I have a feeling that I have seen this video before ? 🤔🤔🤔
do you do this every time you move? #kitchengoals
🌶🌵🍉  Greetings!
おしゃれ！私もＤＩＹ大好きなのでこんな家具自作したいなぁって思います。
真似したい～！
won't rats or bugs be able to go in the drawers
Tシャツ短パン。夏日ありました？笑
作業すると暑いからですね。
You could just leave the drawers as they are without knobs, cos they have a clean minimalistic look. Or you can attach rail handles the width of the drawers, to keep the sleek look, and have a bonus place to hang damp tea towels
So cool!
V;)
あの〜、、半袖半ズボンて寒くないのですか？まだ、この時期の京都めちゃくちゃ寒いはず。。
ooooo
またオシャレかよ
Japanese using German tool ... interesting ...
You will have complicated love relationship for sure ... because of your perfection
I want a pink drill like that! Is it available in USA? How many volts? Brand name? Love your videos!
very gd
clicking like before watching the video because of course <3 ^w^
IKEA  TIME :'(
So neat fully done ... is that because you are having Japanese genes ?
Does anyone know what type of wax that Is?
Seriously who dislikes a soft little video about making chai??
As an Indian, especially Bengali, I'm weeping at it's perfection.
These videos help me alleviate my anxiety.
Indians like me are addicted to masala chai.  😍😍😍
That must smell soooooo gooood 😊😊😊
Seriously one of the best channels! Wish you would post more ❤
I'm from India and I literally have it daily ...we add little black pepper tooo and two leaves of Holy Basil.
Only one thing went wrong at last you cannot just let it sit alone u gotta give her company. Perfect for a cold winter morning.
And here I am, doing my best to smell the tea through my phone. :( ♡
Thats ASMR before ASMR 
it makes me so calm. Thank you
I’m from Pakistan and Masala Chai is something that’s consumed daily in most houses. I’m just glad that this recipe’s accurate unlike most others! ❤️🇵🇰
As usual a really well crafted video :) oh and thank you for not calling it “Masala Chai Tea Latte”
Your video can cure my depression
That's perfect masala chai. 👍 The proportions of the ingredients can vary as per your taste.some of us also add crushed whole black peppers. Especially in the monsoons and winters..Yum.. Such a wholesome drink. Fills your soul.. Goes well with samosas, veg pakoras or simple rusks...
I've never been this early yay
Masala Chai! 😍 i love Chai i have 7-8 cups in sitting 😂...
I am Indian and I love masala chai Soo much..... thank you for improving its recipe for vegans.....I am vegan since January and it's awesome to be vegan...
I’ve waited so long for these and I’ve never been this early!! I’m glad you seem back on your routine and the new place is really nice!
I love your videos! Can you do Filipino food next?
This, along with a nice book to keep you company, and you’re headed towards perfection 
It was peaceful to watch indeed🍃
Finally, another recipe... Waiting for this, like it's been forever... 😌😆
I can actually make this! Thank you for simplifying your recipes a bit. I was a bit intimidated before but this one I can make :)
The built drawers!! 👏🏼👏🏼 your are so talented!
I'm an Indian and I'm a huge chai lover.
Your video is so so beautiful. 
I'm literally addicted
Thanks for this❤️
Woaw!!! Never thought I would see a masala chai video from you!!!
Always a pleasure to have the no music version ^^

Perfect!! Very Very Good My Friend!! 
Success, Always.   Hugs,   #dgtudo
Congratulations!!
please keep making these! they are so relaxing 😌😌
Simple yet complex flavours great job man 😁
Feeling proud as an Assamese for you choice of tea 😄
If only you had Brooke Bond red label natural care tea  . It would be super convenient . Lots of love 😍
I am an Indian, and I approve. This video makes me want to make myself a cup.
なんかめっちゃオシャレに見える...✨
綺麗...！！😍
I was watching another video, then I was notified of this, never clicked so fast before 😂
Ryoya you can also add 3 bay leaves and 1 tsp fennel seeds for more fruity flavour. Cheers :)
Absolutely amazing videos you’ve got !!
I love your videos.
And for loving Chai Tea in India I'm 100% sure that yours must taste incredible!
Just discovered your channel and everything is just so amazing ಥ_ಥ the angles, sounds, lighting, content, EVERYTHING even those hands look good
Maaaan I've never tried Chai with almond milk!! It's always been normal cows milk, that would taste so good 😍😍
Perfect 🇮🇳 but in India we only mix ginger & cardamon 👌
Love from india 
This is similiar to how make i make tea
Well, that's a LOT of spices for some tea.

Good thing it'll taste even better with the flavours.
I bet that’s one strong cup of chai. In a good way. Love your videos! Keep up the great content!
Absolutely yummy, it's been a while and I enjoy every bit of this. Thank you for sharing your journey and tasty recipe. I hope you the the best and good continuation.
Try Darjeeling tea if you ever get chance! Also filter coffee, famous from South India! Love from India :)
Like 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧uk 
Wow this is so good 😊 definitely will try from scratch

Love your channel inspired me to make my first asmr cooking video
Wow, never thought Assam tea would find its way to Japan.

Enjoyed watching the video, now you enjoy that cup of tea.. ☕
It's almost 11 pm and I feel like drinking tea now 😅
Amazing video as always, thank you for all,
I follow your channels since few years now and i love it, congrats for all you do ! But something beginning to make me sad, do you ever though about Zero Waste ? You helped me to get into vegan cooking, I will be very proud if I can sensitize you to zero waste life ! 
Thank you again for your work :)
This tea was healing me after every long day trekking in Himalayas. A daily perfect brew in cold mountain.
He's alive🙌 We don't see him much anymore 😥

Your videos are too perfect for my eyeballs 😂 thank you once again! ❤
He has Bob Kramer knifes
RESPECT
Looks good! A little too much clove in my opinion. However, the great thing about cooking is I can adjust to taste!
I am a fan of yours! Love the simplicity of your videos. You are very humble in the way you approach recipes from around the world. Stress and anxiety-free zone. Thank you!
yum I made this and it was amazing! Thankyou for sharing ❤️
I love masala chai 😍
And the sounds of making it instead of some annoying music with repeated melody 😍😍
Also I love they way all the spices and everything is packed
Love the no music editions. It helps so much with anxiety
Hi! I love your videos but when will you post more on building your new kitchen?  I get so much inspiration and building ideas from you.
He’s flexing with his drawer organization
I look forward to your videos!  Your channel is definitely one to aspire to :) arigato sir!
Hi sir.. your recipes are good.. you should try one more Indian recipe  named SOYA CHAAP
Omg u made it deliciously healthy masala chai. Definitely will try. Love from India 😘
Watching this while sipping my chai😍😍
Going to make that for my lovely Mum...! 👌🏼☕♥️
That must smell so good, I want to try making this myself now (but it won't be nearly as peaceful!)
OMG MY FAVOURITE YOUTUBER MAKING MY FAVOURITE BEVERAGE BRB HYPERVENTILATING RN

I missed your videos so much! My friend is Pakistani and she loves chai, I would love to try to make chai for the both of us, thank you, I'm so glad you're back (:
Sometimes I just rly need to turn of my brain, these are the vids just for that.
Incredibly relaxing and mind clearing to watch your videos. Big thanks xox
Love 🇮🇳 appreciate your video!
You’re channel is so relaxing! Not to mention everything you make looks so appetizing- It makes me want to bake/cook/etc more!
I as an Indian commend you on this chai masterpiece
Just another Indian passing by here🤗 Absolutely stoked to see the perfect version of the Masala Chai.😄
Absolutely fantastic video! I so enjoy watching your videos! Your recipes are tasty, the cinematography superb and it's so relaxing with no unnecessary music. I especially love watching your videos in the evening - they calm me down!
I just found your channel.  What a pleasant experience this is.
I'm Indian and I love this masala chai. Your videos are so calming especially without music. Like chocolate for my ears
This is exactly what I needed today ❤️❤️
Thanks for this Zen :)
Love the camera work, not to mention how organised those shelves are.
I have missed your videos :'( hehe yay to the new video! Thank YOU!
I'm literally drinking masala chai while watching this. Love the video! ❤❤
I think it finally dawned on me what makes this channel so great. He never spills anything. Not a drop. Nothing is ever off.  It also seems like it's all done on the first take. So damn impressive.
I’m so happy you’re back. I love these videos. ❤️
I love to drink chai when it rains
If you want to save the extra, I assume you strain it and refrigerate it? Do you know how long it will last? Thank you! And I love your videos!
大好きです！ いつも楽しみにしています
Ahh! Just like how I do it for my family every morning 💚

Never did it with almond milk before though.

(P.s glad you took our comments from Insta into consideration)
YOU'RE BACK!! 😍
Another beautiful and relaxing video. Bravo!
Video is great but you’re audio is on point.
My new asmr, only delicious.
Aah the aroma!! You know, we used to add dried bay leaf too in the mix. Just experimenting with tea. 😋😋
I work 8-10 hours a day, 5-6 days a week in the medical world. Your recipes are often used on my meal breaks or to prep/perk myself for the day ahead. Thank you for all you do.
I'm from Assam(India)...using Assam tea for making your chai makes me extra happy. Our love for chai is on a next level.
wait a second. Who are those 4 Maniacs, disliked this? God help them.
As soon as I saw the name,,I came to comment section to see how my fellow Indians are reacting to the video...
Please keep always making the videos like this, with no music. Well done ✨
手間暇かけて作られたchai…絶対美味しい😋
This is my everyday tea except I don't add clove 
It tastes weird to me with the clove
Wow that was perfect masala chai! (Except cinnamon xD I never put cinnamon in my masala chai)
Eres todo paz ✌️ 💕’Me encantan tus vídeos 💕
Hey! Was wondering if you know how to make macaroons? !!!
delighted to see you back missed your videos xxx
Love the quality of your videos 💛
I’m so glad you’re back! Always look forward to your videos 😊
It is LITERALLY a peaceful cuisine! This is so aesthetic.
RYOYA IS BACK
THIS IS NOT A DRILL
スパイスから作るチャイ 美味しそうですね〜。動画を見ながら作ってみようと思います😊💛
Oh my god... What a tasty n healthy tea... Wao... Want to drink it from the core of the heart..😀
💜💛 Love the videos w no music
I love this and the taste really new for me..
Long time no see-!! 😆
Perfect! Just like how my Mum makes it! She's from Punjab India and she enjoyed this video! Thanks :))
Damn that's one good masala chai. Reminded me of home
fantastic video!!! love your content :)
Addiction 
for most Indians 😂
Chai is love. ❤️
I don't even know what is masala chai, is it food or beverage, but i'm smiling the whole time watching your video. It feels like a long awaited reunion with your childhood bestfriend. Thank you so much for keep uploading, Ryoya. We love you 😁
I would like to cook something like that
This is my daily routine to make masala chai at home.
woah asmr creator
first second like!
because no music
What you is spectacular! You are spectacular
This is so relaxing! Makes me really want some tea
Thank you.Beautiful and informative video.
お水は何処かの湧水かな？

チャイは大好き♪
香りが届いてきそうです！
Now this is what Indian drinks....
I was just drinking a tea while watching this... And I regret drinking😐.. it's nothing compared to this..
わたしチャイが大好きで、チャイのお店とかよく行くのでこの動画めっちゃテンションあがりました、、、
i had olfactory hallucinations while watching this, omg
300 ML water is too much of you're cooking one or two person. 100 ml is ok.
Wow.... In Bengali we say it "moshola Cha" 😍
I missed you Ryoya!!
this tea makes me sweat, like, a lot
Not really accurate on the method and ingredients but good to watch and listen to nonetheless.
Being an Indian, chai is a must element in my life. You've taken masala chai to another level altogether.
So carefully crafted that the end product caused a smile.  Thank you.
This is my all time fave drink and love making them from scratch too!
When will you prepare vegan Laksa without music??
Satisfying 🤤
is it just me or is this so super asmr
Looks delicious, I love chai 😋
My goodness this is sooo awesome😍
Your videos are so pure ❤️
Hi Ryoya, I have a question: is there any reason why you don't use tap water? I thought tap water in Japan was really good. Love your videos.
Ye hui na baat😄
love it ! thank you and have a beautiful day !
New subscriber here!!!
Hello Mr. Ryoya . The first time am watch channel, i love it
Very interesting! I will do it! Thanks to sharing with us!
生姜強めかな？美味しそう！
So... much... saliva🤤
Perfect. Except that did you make it for a party? That's a lot of chai even for an addict like me 😁
Beautiful video ❤️
I'm a Pakistani and I approve✊
何あのウォーターサーバー。カッコいい…
That looks amazing
Could you also try to make Turkish Salep? It's very similar to Chai Tea Latte
I imagine that the clove is all you can tastes. That much clove for only a glass of liquid. Gzzz. I always like peaceful cuisine, but now i a little bit dissapointed
This is such perfect timing cause I've been thinking of making masala chai recently instead of buying it
YOU’RE BACK !!!
Hi Ryoya, I'm from India and live in Canada. Masala chai is one of my favourites! I make it exactly as you've shown, but my favourite flavouring - besides ginger and cardamom - is a bunch of lemongrass and mint. Love it! The tea becomes so fragrant and delicious! Love all your videos. I've been subscriber since a couple of years now. If you're ever in Vancouver and want a taste of authentic Indian curry, I'll be glad to host :-)
Thanks for making
Looks delicious!!
This is a short movie. Not a recipe.
I'm gonna be making this one. Love these videos. No music and everyone shuts up.
Wonderful! I’m looking forward to trying this type of tea. I wonder if a flavored almond milk could be used?
Second. Being first is overrated.
Whenever I search for Assam CTC, I don't get exact results for it to buy..?
crying because its so beautiful...
Masala Chai is one of the best tea or the best tea in the world.
I made Masala chai. Same chai but different video. I want to cry: Thanks you for your beautiful video. I'm Korean living in Singapore. Hi to you.
So aesthetically pleasing! 💗😌 Continue making amazing work!!
And how organised that drawer was....
クイジンさんは自然の照明が好みなんでしょうか。
That looks delicious!
I’ve never actually seen tea be made from scratch, so this was really interesting!! It looks delicious and I’d love to try this recipe someday 💕
Similar. But I drink masala coffee. It tastes great!
literaly first!
I’m so obsessed with this channel. Awesome recipes and awesome videography and camera work. What could be better??
Mmmmm.....That aroma of masala ☕️😋
Im a non vegetarian and i like watching your videos regardless
Simplicity perfected. <3
Recipe has right ingredients but modified according to your taste I think 
I usually make my chai by grinding these 4 masalas but in lesser quantity by hand, cane sugar, cow milk, Assam tea (preferably Wagh bakri)
1度でいいから飲んでみたい！
あれ、水入れる機械みたいなの、有ります！
収納も完成度上がってる
けど、コンロは見慣れたやつで
安心しました〜
何でかな？
this made me want to sleep thamkyou
Welcome to India!!!
I think ginger is too much, it'll hit the throat.
字が小さすぎて、見えないです、、、、泣、、、
Do a video of Steamed Bun
Your videos are literally art
Omggg you back 😍
masala chai😍😍😋
So calming☺
As an Assamese Indian, this is perfection.
Drinking Masala Chai while watching this
It's awesome without music 🙂🙂
i just been thinking about this! Delicious!!
Drink it!!!
Good to see you back :) Hello from England.
Looks like a scene in a movie💖
I can imagine the smell of it..
holy you're alive?
いい香りなんだろうな～
0:31~のとこ、脳内にかまじいがフラッシュバックした
4:25 damn that sounds good uwu
(for non-indians) try regular milk instead of almond milk
Arigatou gozaimasu
どんな味がするのか全く想像が出来ない
Too much work for the amount.
Watching this at 1am
I want some NOW!
久しぶりに見た気がします
chai+boba=heaven
Aahh i miss you ❤
Watching this as I drink my chai ! 🤗
First of all welcome back
カルダモンでしばゆー思い出した
Talk about food asmr
I wish this thumbs up were heart. In my country that is considered a luxury although it comes processed in a bottle  and you only have to add milk...still love your unique way.
お久しぶりです。
久しぶり～
1:10 evak
I live in Pakistan but never had this Masala Chai 
LOL.
These vids are so soothing
Looks wonderful <3
Plz make biryani 😀
you finally got the ginger
I wish I could smell that!
AMSR 🔥🔥
素敵なビデオブラザー
Lovely recipe!
Ем пельмени с чесночным соусом и смотрю это великолепное видео.
That looks sooooo good
Put some basil leaves & lemongrass.... buffalo milk.... it will be authentic Indian chai
Bestestttttttt bestest😎😍
no star anise? no nutmeg?
Yay a new video
Is almond milk used in india as well?
How fancy!
It's soothing
First
First
Please make any summer drinks.
Itu jamu ya om?
Awesome please heart. Watching from New York. America
Finally early
Is this medicinal?
Every household in India has their own way of making a masala chai (Tea). I,mix the milk+water ( boil),add in the tea powder ,along with ginger+cardamom. Since I am not a big fan of white sugar,I either add a sugar substitute or drink it sugarless . Some people do add a small stick of cinnamon too and lastly some fresh mint leaves 🙂
I'm an Indian and I love masala chai soooo much.
I would like some
❤️
❤️❤️❤️
do you own a cafe?
👍🏻
Interestingly, even though we drink it daily, we only put ginger and not other stuff like - cloves and cinnamon
May i suggest using less water to milk ( 1/2 cup water  to 1 cup milk  )and let it boil to the top of the pan 3 times ( turning heat down each time ) . This will intensify the tea flavour😊😊
Why almond milkk
I want one.Looks so good
最近、サブチャンネルを含めて更新頻度が高くてちょっと嬉しい笑
So serene
I’ll try it for mom!
I don’t even know what this is but I still watched :)
Yummy!!
That’s warm my body and heart......
Delicious!
So relaxing. Love it. I wonder why sometimes people pan fry spices first but u went right to boiling. Would pan frying release more flavor first or no?
魔法使いみたいだ
👌👌
Great way to start my Sunday.
After going to India for 2 weeks in the winter, seeing this makes me miss the chai over there so much. I drank chai every day while in India and I really hope to go back again sometime. For the meantime, I'm going to attempt making chai in the States.
Where my Indian fam at?!
Lovely. Would it still be masala chai if I added some chopped rind of clementine orange? The rind is so aromatic I cannot resist. i would also sub the almond milk with coconut cream milk.
ひよこ豆が生クリームに？！
菜食したくても全くレシピが分からない、スウィーツも好きなので本当に尊敬！憧れます。
Webサイトもお邪魔しました！レシピ本購入します(^ ^)
What if I wanted to make a larger batch? Say, for 600ml of milk and 600 ml of water, do I have to double all the other ingredients?
I feel like this guy has been watching me make chai. I use honey instead of sugar and put a little saffron.  The honey makes a huge difference.
Masala tea is NOT made with almond milk.  
Shame, it’s a good video otherwise.
I’m a tea person with no sugar x)) I have it with one clove and two cardamom everyday. However, we also make tea almost same way... but I don’t know if it has an official name (some people call it Adani tea “from Aden city in Yemen”. I will share the recipe with you, though. I hope you try it. 
Boil milk and water first with cardamom and nutmeg (adding cloves and sugar are optional at this point) then add ceylon tea. Make it simmer for few minutes then... Done :3 Enjoy🌷
If you hadn’t added sugar, you can add one tsp (or more) to your cup.
Peaceful Masala Chai
Looks great! :)
Potentially dumb question, but does prepared masala chai keep well in the refrigerator/reheat well? I live alone, and this recipe looks like more than I would drink in a sitting.
Almond milk and palm sugar 😅😯😓😕😵
wow first samosa and then masala chai. Where did you learn it? Have you visited India?
Did you visit India recently?noticed the red thread on your hand...
I have liked the Clove in my tea so I have and won’t add in my Chai but My Fav of all time is Ginger and Cardamom. .. Grew up with that flavour 😋😋😋 
GINGER AND CARDAMOM Boiled in water and then Hot milk is added and kept on sim for Two Minutes and then Sugar and Tea Powder 😋😋 And strained over a Jug (we use A Cotton or Nylon Strainer as It filters every bit of Tea leaves/powder and then poured in the Cups or glass cuz We make Tea for the family .. I’m a South Indian where Coffee is Famous but I grew up in a Chai Drinking Family and hence I can make amazing Chai .. Cannot Make The Filter Coffee although I LOVE IT 😋😋
You forgot lemon grass. But anyway, great tea.
if i had no school, if i lived on my own, i'd do this every morning <3
I don't know what it is but it definitely looks yummy
As I am from Assam am happy to see that you are using ASSAM CTC for making masala tea. 🙆🙆
Please, what díd he put before the sugar? If it might be in spanish.... thanks 🙂
Substitution with cane sugar wouldn't have too adverse of a change in the flavor, would it?
今、風邪気味なので凄く効きそうですね＾＾でもアッサムCTCって何だろう…？
Very nice.. Can you please make a similar video of how you prepare coffee? Not the instant one..
Can I get a kitchen tour it's just so neat I want to be a part of it
Indian BTS army anyone?
Original recipe includes black pepper.
No, not almond milk. you have to use full-fat buffalo milk if you really wanna drink authentic Indian masala chai.
ボブクレーマーのナイフ、新しく購入しましたか？
牛刀を持ってたイメージはありましたが……
I would suggest the substitution of Irish Breakfast or any Black tea for the Extremely bitter assam CTC tea.
How the heck you know to make this and so perfectly. You Would make my mom's masala chai lose in front of yours.
How does he know that that's 300ml?  03:10
thanks for sharing...juste une question..quelqu un peut il me dire ce qu est le assam CTC? un thé noir? merci pour la réponse.
Very Indian
But why almond milk, usually we put milk high in milk fat which gives that creamy texture.
Thank god you don’t start with “ HI WELCOME   BACK TO MY CHANNEL” and show the face 98% of the video. 👍🏻 great video
Pewdiepie: i'm here to spill the real tea
Is it bad that I imagine him licking the spatula at 3:54?
Hyderabadi masala chai................luv from india 😚😂😂😂😂😎😍😍😍😍
It's a Pakistani drink..He added way too much cardamom and cloves..
Edited:I make this daily..
A worthy attempt for sure, but room for improvement. Reduce the clove, add whole black peppercorns. Toast all your spices in a dry pan.  The milk to water ratio will impact the overall strength of your tea. Bring your chai to a boil and then let it simmer away... and reduce by at least 30%. The brick red color and rich viscosity are signs you have done well. Now enjoy and report back.
Awesome video, but... In the future, could you upload your videos in widescreen resolution? I have an ultrawide monitor, and the black bars in the video don't let me take advantage of that. I get black bars on the sides AND the top and bottom now.


Keep up the good work btw, I've been following you for a few years now, and I love your videos. Greetings from The Netherlands!
HOW MUCH MONEY DO U EVEN HAVE
too much clove...unless you really like clove, but not really "Indian chai"
Tea and cigarette, a perfect blend.
Which buckwheat did u used for making soba ?
Aaaamd you just ruined it with almond milk 😖
All that stuff is toxic. We need to be eating only raw meat for a true healthy life.
りょうやさん、もっと動画出してくださいよー！サボらないでください〜
You got most of the ingredients bang on, Takashima-san !! In Mumbai, India, we like our masala chai in petite glasses, which we call "cutting chai".... It basically means half a regular cup. My family loves masala chai with a few mint leaves, fresh or dried. They pair really well with the ginger. Do try it sometime! I am a big fan of your cooking and videos!!:)
We usually add black pepper n bring the tea to a boil a couple of times. Love ur videos. You inspired me to learn to cook after my mom died 2 years ago. My first dish were the Pumpkin Buns! Very very difficult! But you are a great teacher like my mom was! Thank you! 🙏
Love from India. Watching your videos is therapeutic and soothing. Keep up the good work. Brilliant
待ってました！
今回も素敵な作品をありがとうございます✨
このBGM好きで、なんだか懐かしくなりました(*´-`)
それに日光の入り方もいい雰囲気出てると感じました✨
スタジオのレイアウトは完成されましたか？？
もしよければスタジオツアーしていただけると嬉しいです(*´∇｀*)
Hello. I'm a Vegan and from India. Masala Chai and Saffron Chai are my #favourite👍 I must say your Chai will be really delicious as you added Palm sugar instead of regular sugar. Good thinking!! Would love to taste your Chai made this way! Honest Appreciation from India 👍👍 Hope to go to Japan soon and meet up with you if luck be. Till then Keep up with the good work
始まりから終わりまで、まるで映画のよう✨香りが届くんじゃないかって。届かないけど…
This is a familiar sight! In small clay pots and raw cane sugar. We use locally grown tea, with vanilla in it. Loose tea and add a dash of black pepper. Brings back childhood memories of winter- massala chai and bhajia (savoury snacks) with tomato chutney, crushed on stone. Thank you for the trip down memory lane, fellow '83.
I love it so much, i watch both this and the [No Music] video, I just love the color of the video. Σd(≧ω≦*) ｸﾞｯ
りょうやさんの動画大好きです。YouTubeを見始めて最初にチャンネル登録したのはPeaceful Cuisineでした。
最近は他の方のビーガン動画を見たりしますが、やっぱりりょうやさんの動画が最高です。自分の知らない世界をYouTubeを通してりょうやさんに教えてもらってる感じです。料理だけではなく、旅行の動画などなど✈️🌍
ここに来ると落ち着くので、過去動画も何度も見てます☺︎
動画の内容と関係のないコメント失礼しました🏄‍♀️
I can’t wait to make this. I enjoy using my mortar and pestle. I use black pepper in my chai I will try your recipe with and with out. Thank you for deciding to post this. Blessings
So peacful!  11:39 pm 😔😔, I imagined that i was drinking it....made me sleepy.  Thank you for the drink ☕. ☺☺ 👍 👍
Wonderful, beautiful, peaceful, I love this video! 😍
And I love that kind of tea as well, I've made a recipe about same kind of tea on my channel, but Thai version 🙂
This is so relaxing to watch!!!😌...kind of a therapy!
やかましいインド人がいそうな気がしたw
This looks SOOOO good! Even my cat was interested.
God damn it!! Instantly reminded me of home. Late evenings, watching Toonami with my brother.
Finally someone used the correct phrase 'masala chai'.
Usually there r some people who says 'masala chai-tea' 🙄🙄.
Thanks for a great recipe.😍👏
Stunning as always, very inspiring video, thank you ☺️
I fell in love with this channel only after 5 seconds. Thank you for your work !!!!
we use the same brand for cloves! basically best friends
Relaxing, beautiful, and delicious!
Dont do this with soy milk; it seperates. 

Also, a bit of star anise is very tasty in there!
I want a mortar and pestle but dont know how to choose...
i still hesitate on what kind i should buy since i would use it for many different things...
Ah the time you used Assam tea 😊 I grew up in beautiful Assam drinking amazing tea ❤️ Amazing video as always!
As weird as it might sound, I love cayenne in my chai.  


I loved the music selection. ^_^ It's calming and thoughtful.
Beautiful video PC! Wish you uploaded more often... I enjoy them so much!
My grandma used to make masala tea every morning for me.. Dude this video gave me  some sweet memories ...love from India 💗...

YouTube needs more people like him
Wow it looks amazing thank you for the video xoxoxo
Love from Indonesia... I will try your Recipe , Ryoya San . Thank you for your beautiful video as always.
Make sure it's Ceylon cinnamon people. Other one is cassaia and can be toxic.
i just want to live with you. </3
Being Assamese I feel so proud at your choice of tea 😄...
Hi from France ! I really like your channel and I was wondering where you were finding your musics backgrounds because it always make me peaceful when I heard them.
器はりょうやさん作でしょうか、、
すごく好みです。
It's kinda the same we do but we call it kark in middle east it look like we changed the recipe around the world ❤ love your videos
wow, thanks for posting Indian sub continent recipe. love From India.
You should make a video for onigiri!
インスタで見て動画楽しみにしていました！ちょうどチャイ作りたかったんでマネしてみます！😆あと湧き水入れてるタンクがどこのメーカーですか？
It appears to me that there is really large volume of liquid in total...do you boil off any water?
Just last night I was thinking about how I should find a good chai recipe. Can't wait to try this!
Yaaay... you're back..and I love this video because I'm a teapot!! I love tea..☕️😊 love from Shillong, India💖
It's so soothing... 😇✨✨
So happy to see you again, missed you:)
You missed black pepper and Holy-basil
チャイを淹れていたカップってどこのか分かりますか？
いい香りしてきたなぁ～、あ、動画だ…(´・ω・`)…
The lighting in the old kitchen will be missed
But the lighting in this new kitchen is ❤ as well
Your videos are so peaceful and calming 😌
I love that you make things I’ve never heard of
Finally. Loved it!! 😍
Absolutely my cup of tea 🍵
It looks delicious, love ginger teas.  thanks for the video!
please, tell which is your camara model. its wonderful how you film. thanks a lot
Yayy you're back!!!!! I'm so happy
wow, but IMO too much cinnamon and you can brake the cinamon to much effect
I always make this at home every weekend on my cheatmeal...😋
FYI, Assam is a state in India which produces the most fragrant, black tea in the world. Assam tea is named after it.
I can smell it all the way here (Georgia), my mom makes chai at least once a week. Gracias
Ahh masala chai one of the best tea in the world just behind cha yen.
Ok tomorrow go to get myself 1 cup for breakfast at local shop
One more ingredient that goes well in masala for chai is fennel seeds crushed.
For that much tea  , I put half quantity of spice and a few holy basil leaves and sometimes lemongrass leave . With my Sunday morning peaceful time. Love your videos.
Looks delicious makes me wish I could smell the video while the tea was simmering
you need labels on those mason jars ! ;-)
Never seen before food cinematography .
Watching your videos makes me feel calm and peaceful :D
スパイスも揃ってるし作ってみよ😆
りょうやさんの動画見てると何だか元気が出てきます。こーゆー生き方もいいなぁ。って思えて励まされます。有難うございます。
¡Gracias a tí!
So inspired, and perfect for this Sunday afternoon.
Happy to see you’re back making videos again ❤️
يسوي كرك 😊
Superb 💕 love from India 🇮🇳
This looks so good
Ah chai! 😍 we Indians are crazy about chai 😁
I usually boil tea leaves and sugar first and them add milk and boil it again, it enhances the taste. Btw, love your videos they're very pleasing to watch.
Amazing! I like your video as always:)
I was just thinking when the next video would be uploaded - wow! I got my wish :3
材料解らないものだらけですが、見慣れてるルピシアが出て来て驚きました(^^)
いつも応援しています！
Yes yes yes - u tried making dosa ?
Awesome episode as always ❤️❤️❤️ arigato 🙏
We also use Iherb, love it!
ルピシアの茶葉だ٩(*´︶`*)۶
久しぶりの動画うれしいです🤤
Maybe we will some day witness how the situation with the glasses in the drawer will be solved, since so far you cannot tell what's in them without picking one up or ruining the aesthetics with a self-written sticker...
Sri Lankan cinnamon! Woo!
in Malaysia, we commonly drink tea from the leaf one. we have the trees planted here in Sabah n Cameron Highland. Yes, we boiled it with sugar only. just it! like Chinese tea. n this masala chai however keep me thinking, is there really 'chai' like this? I'm gonna make it in my mom's kitchen, gonna try soon. ^^
So peaceful cuisine, relaxing, happiness, really I did enjoy of watching, even I will not make that tea
Ah ithu kollam. Inganem chaya undakkamennu manasilayi
What is the brand of the portable stove you're using?
Wonderful!  Will be making this weekend
毎度思うチタン鍋の素敵さ
ほすぃ〜
Im so happy to see another food video from you
Will your app be available in the iOS store too at some point?
Always follow your video 💓💓
Wow the freakishly small spatula #foodwishes chef John needs to see this
美味しそうなので今度レシピ参考にして作ってみます。
チャイ、みてたら飲みたくなりました、ちょうど材料も揃っているのでいまから作ります～(*´∀｀)
すごい自然的な感じがして、落ち着きます😊いつも素敵な動画をありがとうございます(*´︶`*)❤︎
美味しそう💛チャイティ大好き💫なかなかお店のやつと同じ味のが家で飲めないからお店でベンティサイズを買って片手に持って家に着くまで飲んで帰ってます🌝🤭
人生充実してるとしか思えない
2:25 am, what a nice video
Labels on the tops of those jars, Baby!  Cool video, thanks. 😃
So nice to see you again.. ♡
This looks amazing!!!
２つ動画をアップしてたのですね…まさかの見逃しでした😭💦アッサムCTC注文しました👌😊💕マサラチャイ私も子供も大好きです♡
I love it .. I am an Arab and I love what you offer in your channel 👌🏻🍂
.. It is always okay. Also the coffee that you made .. I made a lot like it ..🌸
try adding some star anise too! it goes great with the other spices you've used
From where did you get Assam CTC
An anime film called "koe no katachi" sent me here
In the film,one of the characters was drinking shiso juice
So i searched it up and found this wonderful channel :)
4:05 イテ〜
I need this is in my life !
なんと言うか、無印感。
オシャレすぎ！ハマりそう☺️
ちゃいめっちゃ好き
May I suggest adding the milk earlier on and bringing it to a boil with the water and masala. Fresh mint leaves are also a good addition! :)
Well its great to see that you did your research unlike other YouTubers who calls Chai, Chai-tea. Where the meaning of Chai in English is tea. So it's like saying tea tea 😂. You also got the recipe right which is great because no one other then Indian YouTubers seems to know how Chai is made. But they still makes idiotic Chai making tutorials.
I love your videos🙏🏻🌱🌎🐷🐮
That's how it made.
To this mix I add 1 star anise pod.
とても贅沢なミルクティーですね！
引き出しの中オシャレすぎ！！
なんてこった　　、水入れるだけで画になるよ〜〜〜ｗｗ
That's a beatiful color of tea
公開を楽しみにしていたので嬉しいです。ありがとうございます。
映像中に差し込む日の光がとても美しいですね！
水をそそぐシーンもなぜだか無性に惹かれます。😊
Also make masala coffee!
First lol. Finally uploaded 💖💖💖 So peaceful as always. Love your videos 💖✨✨

I looovve masala chai by the way💞thanks for the heart
スパイス揃えたくなりました。自分で作ってみます!
Finally!!!
もしYouTubeに4D機能できても、この香りは表現できないだろうな笑笑
That's a proper cup of tea
そういえば前に水は湧き水を汲んでるって言ったはったけど京都に湧き水ってどっかあったっけ？？🤔🤔
🔥🔥🔥
Finally :D
A delicious tee,  i'll try today :-)
the best hot drink in winter
finally a new video😀
素敵なビデオブラザー👌
飲みちゃい！
So stoked to see your new video!
😋🤩😋🤩
finally there is the update! have been waiting for so long
Perfect.
FIRST BITCHES
This video is therapeutic lol
For me almond milk is ok for muesli but not for chai.
🖤
やかましいインド人ちゃうんかい
..come to India Rhoya...love from Mumbai.
How much is a one cup serving in ml?
Is masala chai that famous?😯
yummy
りょうやさんもinlivingさんのこと知ってるのかな…？たまたまか😌
Feel relax when i watching your vdo.

Can i use anything instead of assam ?

Thanks
Masala chai Kreygasm
Tnx
I love yours videos. From Brazil.:)
Looks delicious.
I think there's too much masala. A little bit of all them ingredients would be okay. I mean a pinch. I like mine solely made from milk.
スパイスとハーブはどこで買っていますか？
Nice :)
yeah comeback is real
What song is that? Is so calming I really want to listen to it when sleeping
映画みたい
I can send you the original and best Assam tea leaves if you ever run out of it. Love from Northeast India. ❤
I'd choose to turn off the stove for a while if ground tea is used. Last time I made masala chai with it, I overheated it, letting loose all the evil caffeine, taste superb..until I lost all my oxygen and my heart trying to hammer its way out of my chest. 😆
Any Indians here? 🙋
Jippyyy , a new video <3
♡♡♡
I was just drinking chai right now whilst scrolling down YouTube and this popped up. I immediately clicked on it bc I thought to myself what if I’m making this chai wrong 😂😭
No orange peel? No black pepper? Don't worry, this is a very good video. It's therapeutic.
It's peaceful cuisine's SPECIAL MASALA CHAI and not yours regular masala chai.Its your version of chai by adding Almond milk and Palm sugar. In india 1 cup of good chai cost around 10 to 15 rupees(15- 23 yens) in local stall but you added ALMOND MILK,PALM SUGAR & ASSAM TEA its goes beyond luxuries cost.I think it will cost you 300-500 rupees(470-790 yens)per cup or beyond in 4-5 star hotel,if it made  by your recipe.
Peaceful Masala Chai
Yay my Japanese hubby 💓😘 Love always from your UK wifey 😉🇬🇧
1:33 this clip irritates the heck out of me i have no idea why but it's truly annoying
☕ 🌱😊😊 
🌏🗾😊😊
🇮🇳🇯🇵😊😊
Very nice. I suggest an appliance to you. It's a Mason jar sealer. I bought mine at Walmart it is inexpensive. I keep it plugged in on my counter. All those jars of spices  will have a much longer shelf life. You fit the circle part on top of the jar with the lid on. No ring. Put sealer on top. Hit the button. It vacuum seals the jar, sucking out the air. You can pop the lid off to use contents and easily reseal jar. Also can use it in fridge for condiments, leftover food, anything. It highly extends shelf life of foods. Love your style!
I want to drink this nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
We Indians use buffalo or cow milk and add it before the tea leaves
We Indians love to drink masala chai especially during winter. 
It really helps when you suffer from flu.
Your videos are so well made that if I saw one of your videos at a place like the Sundance Film Festival, I would not question it for a second.
I don't even have enough money for so those spices haha!
Very nice.  👍👍♨️🍄🍄
Are the colors straight out of camera or do you colorgrade your footage ?
お久しぶりです- :)
I'm so excited to try this!  I love masala chai, but find most package teas (bags & loose leaf) are not strong enough.  This looks like it'll have some kick to it!  For those that add black pepper, how much do you add to a recipe like the one featured in this video?
Awesome video!
Which one is delicious: almond milk, soy milk or cows milk?
Nice recipe for masala chai but do make sure to keep the gas stove clean while cooking
You made it better then we do in india . And hello from india i subbed to pewdiepie btw
？？？「またスパイス取るの忘れたネ。クシシシシシシww」
Where did you buy those mortar & pestle? Couldn't find white ones of that size in Japan.
最後でやっと気づいた、マサラチャイって飲み物だったんだ
Hi~honestly it’s perfect but I’m wondering if I could use brown sugar instead of palm sugar since I don’t have that?
マサラチャイ？サトシのことか？
J ai pas trop compris c'était quoi mais sa donne grave envie
Have a lovely new year !! ;)
These are actually black soy beans - nothing to do with the western ones
I always associate cooking with love and kindness, and even tho i love ur no music ones, these videos with music soothe me differently. Thank you, Ryoya-san for always providing us with quality content, have a happy new year to you too 💜
Iron egg? Gold leaf? Where is the Silver water?
Your videos without music soothe me in an asmr sense but your videos with music remind me of watching a character in a studio ghibli movie make a meal 🥰 so peaceful, as always
Would someone care to explain what the iron egg does?
Only you can make cooking beans worth watching !
Black bean is one of the tradition New Year Osechi meal and represent the heathy and  hard working for next year. Some of Japanese said that it's mean to work hard under the sun until the skin turn black like the bean. of course that's a joke.
Very good video's! The shots are very clean and the dishes look/are delicious. Can you show us how to make vegan Onigiri?
The ‘iron egg’ is used to add the iron supplement and the black color. I use this sometimes also.

いつも素敵な動画感謝感謝 (*´ω`*)
リョーヤさん、共にみている皆さん、よいお年をお迎えください ^^
I've missed you so much.
The plate you served them on looks so nice.
Gold leaf!? Indulgent!
I wish you would end your videos by taking a bite of your foods. That would be so satisfying after all your work! 😀
アク取るの好きだなー分かる人いるかな？
Happy Lunar New Year everyone! Every time I feel stressed or something I always watch your video to come down! Thank you for sharing!

amo os seus vídeos, são muito bem feitos♡❢
I have not had these beans in about 15 years! I'm so glad I found this recipe. I'm a Vegan and just found your channel. I love how you promote the message. And your videos give me ASMR. Thanks so much for these beautiful cooking videos. The music is a fine touch.
Quero mais vídeos. ❤️
As always, beautiful music and a great recipe 😊
Now you're cooking with metals ? Iron, gold ?? Very strange...

Whoa I have so many questions. What is the iron egg for and what was that rack when simmering for 4 hours?? Gold leaf? Fancy aren't we. 😁
We have exactly same dish in Korea called Kongjaban! ✨ it is just so nostalgic and heartwarming to watch your videos.
You should make chocolate covered strawberries for Valentine’s Day!!! ♥️
@Peaceful Cuisine
Hello! Big fan! I was looking for a video I thought you had made, for Ratatouille? Was that you or am I mistaken? It appears to no longer be on your channel, and I am no longer sure if I have left my native dimension. Please help.
黒豆がまるで宝石のように見えますね。器も素敵です。
今年は動画を通じて料理の楽しさを覚えました。
来年もぜひ楽しみにしています。どうぞ良いお年を！
Happy New Year!  Your work...enhancing simplicity through the visuals in your video, audio, and food is artfully amazing.

とても優雅な気分に浸れます…☆今年も、ありがとうございました＾＾
Hi hello yes I have subscribed
A drop lid! When I cook beans they seem like a vulcano (I take out the foam, too), never thought of that solution. Happy new year!
That was completely enchanting. You work magic.
美味しそう。。
器かわいい
someone start a gofundme for this man's supply of maple syrup

I really love the music! How can i find it?
Why is update so slow now?
Happy new year Ryoya San. Always a delight to watch all your videos.
タイムリーな動画に感謝です。よいお年をお迎えください😊
新しい映像も見たいです。
とてもいい感じです :)
Thanks so much Ryoyaa... 😊
cant believe i fell in love with a video about beans this is marvelous
Hope to see more of your recipes in 2019.
That was great, I like the instrument. 👍
Even the ad that i got was asmr
I always watch your channel, even I can't cook. Watching your video is like a therapy, very calm and peaceful. Hehe... Please upload more and more and more videos. I wish you always healthy and happy.
Iron egg? Is that like cooking in a cast iron pan to get the iron benefits?
i hope you are doing well
すごい！！

美しすぎる…✨
黒豆美味しいよね
Wonderful!  Have a wonderful New Year 🎉
we Indians usually add iron thing while soaking the pulses and grains, but i have never seen adding an iron thing while cooking.....good practice though.....good for health.
京都らしくて、ほっこり。タイトルを「黒豆の煮方」にした方がいいのでは。Lovely~. Very “Kyoto style” that makes me smile. The title in Japanese sounds better in “Kuromame no nikata” not “——tsukurikata” . It’s just my suggestion.
Oh man, Jesus Christ need to bless this channel
撮影編集全てにおいてセンスがありますね^ ^思わずチャンネル登録しました^_^
だいぶ前から動画を見ていて、手の込んでいる料理で素敵だなーって思っていたのですが、ヴィーガンだと知ってさらに好き度が上がりました…！

In Mexico blackbeans are cooked with onion, garlic & salt and eaten with tortillas. Love your art videos👌❤
Chef can u cook some indonesian cuisine?
Ahhh yessss kuromame in time for the new year!
Can you please make a cuisine involving Chia?
What does the iron egg do?
Can I use pressure cooker instead of simmering it for 4 hours.
Bi biftek yapta yiyek 9hifuudsyaaivi
I think you should throw away the soaking water of the beans before consumption
Does it matter what kind of blackbeans you use? Mine are more kidney shaped and have a white dot.
Wonderful content!
Hi from the Maritimes, Canada. An old saying here was “well, that changes the water over the beans,!” We never cooked beans in their soaking water for digestive reasons. I never questioned, just always did the same. I am not vegan but have been a vegetarian for over 40 years now and truly enjoy your channels.
Where did you go

You made a sort of pressure cooker by dropping the inner lid directly onto the black beans. Very interesting.
I love to eat this and the serving in restaurants are never enough! Now I know that it’s actually quite easy to make I’ll try!!😊
항상좋은 영상 감사드립니다~~ 2018년 수고 하셨습니다~남은 시간 좋은 일들만 가득 하길 바라겠습니다 2019년도에도 좋은 영상~기분좋은 영상~많이 올려주세요~~감기조심하세요 ^^

I've never seen black beans so large! Mmmmm beans
京都にあるLADERってキッチン洋品店のお店ご存知ですか？
私も数回行ったことがあるのですが、多分気に入っていただけそうなお店なのでよかったらぜひ。ネットショップもあるみたいです。
さすが。
how do i keep this? with the water or do i drain first before keeping in the fridge? i really enjoy this!
you can put some amylum in the black been soup，it‘s like ようかんmaybe
はじめまして。綺麗な料理と思いながら拝見しています。体によいものを使った料理は参考になります。黒豆も、こんな風においしい作り方があるのですね。金箔をふると華やかですね。華のある食文化に憧れます。
No way gold is good for you.
love the gold leaf in the end
鉄卵入れると変わるんですか？
His channel isnt dead right...?
What about the iron egg?
鉄の卵の目的は何ですか？
what on earth is an iron egg
観てると、黒豆の甘い香りがすっと思い出せました。お鍋やお皿がいつも可愛くてかっこよくて、私もとりあえずの物じゃなくて少しずつ良いものを買っていこうと思わせてくれます。アクを取る時、小さいボールに方にお水を入れて、そこで掬いを濯ぐようにすると簡単にアクが掬いから離れていきますよ。もしやったことなければ今度試してみてください☺️

What's the iron egg for?
i’m watching this...and suddenly there is an iron egg??
far better than those creepy asmr videos no hate just my opinion
鉄の卵は何のために入れるのですか？
I wonder if we can drink or cook something with that liquid? Feels kinda wasteful to just throw them away.
What’s the song?
Why the iron egg
新年あけましておめでとうございます(≧◇≦)去年はお引越しお疲れさまでした(*´▽｀*)新居での新年はどうでしょうか？今年もまた色々な動画をお願いします！所で鉄卵って何のために入れたんですか？
I was all in until the gold leaf.  I honestly cannot think of something more pointless and pretentious to add to a dish.
Why you use an iron egg?
If I don't have iron egg. What can I use instead it?. And I want to know, Why do you drop iron egg in a pot? I really don't know & sorry for asking. Love your food 💜💜💜
What does an iron egg do? I would love to know more about that.
手抜きやろ絶対笑
“Add iron egg”..... naturally, of course, let me just get mine
I think 80% of people never try these recipes but are here just for the asmr/aesthetic satisfaction these videos are
For anyone who is confused:

-The dish is a traditional one for New year
-It is black soybean to be exact, not the normal black bean
-Iron egg, or anything iron (gg lucky iron fish if you want to know more) is to make the bean the darkest as possible cause usually when cooked they turn brown/reddish
-Not changing water is also to keep the color black
-Gold leaf is edible, the amount of gold is very thin and gold is basically biologically inert so yeah :v
It’s like watching poetry.
Iron egg and gold leaf? Something you don't see every day :D
That’s weird. He said no music.......but yet that’s all I hear
This channel is like meditation
I am amazed that this video that only cooks beans makes me interested
"i heard you liked lids, so we're putting a lid on top of your lid"








ik it'd a dead meme but i couldn't help it xD
This channel needs more recognition.
Can someone explain to me the Iron Egg thing? Thanks.
Only you can make cooking beans worth watching !
Yo with each thing he added to the pot I was like 
GASP! what!?
What is the iron egg for?
This is like a full on chefs table here. That angle, that quality, that skill! Wow.
手作りだと甘さ調節出来るからいいですよね
作ってみようかな
Your videos are so relaxing...

This channel should be called "ASMR Cuisine"
お正月ですね…🎍💕🎍
Gold leaf everyone! *sobbingly looking in to my wallet
Thank you Ryoya 😘 Best wishes for New year 2019 💓 Look forward to seeing more of your wonderful videos 👌
Love from UK 🇬🇧
I apreciate the effort you put into your videos.
You should be putting the word ASMR into every title it would give you more views
Ryoya, I am so grateful for you and this channel ❤️
So many of the ingredients you use are foreign to me, but the way you cook, the way you handle your utensils and of course the way you shoot your videos is pure magic. They calm me down like nothing else on YouTube! 
Today I had a moment of real anger, and instead of coming here and listening to music like I usually, I watched one of your 'No Music' videos and instantly felt better. Thank you 🙏🏼
When i was hard to sleep, this video make me easy this video was my enjoyable, this video was my medicine of my daily stress, thank you so much, with this kind of video i can sleep now, its my relaxation. Keep going!!
Can you make vegan tapioca milk tea
There's an actual dish in Taiwan called "iron egg" so I got really confused for a moment. I thought this is a vegan channel. 😅😅😅
Iron egg? Gold leaf?
Lowkey should upload these to spotify.They make me relax n fall asleep.
There are two✌️ mystical ingredients I've never heard of before Iron egg 🥚 and gold leaves🍂
Lmao all these people thinking a chef doesn't know what he's doing. Cool
I love these beans! Thank you for another stunning video :D
this is the only asmr I can tolerate lol
Damn and I thought I'd be first
Gold makes everything taste better ;)
Delicious... Perfect!
Very Very Beautiful.
Hugs from Brazil!
Thank you so much for sharing! :)
Omg finally an new video I love watching these
I always love your videos , specially your camera angels , Post production  and sound , loved It  😊

Amazing! More please!
Is he just eyeballing the amount of ingredients bc I never see him use measuring utensils
This is Amazing.
鉄玉子かわいい〜❤
Asmr pretty much?
I LIVE FOR YOUR VIDEOS! Thanks for the upload ❤❤❤
Hi there! I love your videos ❤️
I just would like to suggest that u shouldn’t use the water in which u soak the beans. In fact, while soaking, the beans release indigestable elements that you don’t want to eat. I suggest you to drain and rinse the beans properly and discard the soaking water the next time. Use some fresh and new water to cook them 😊
Thank you for your videos ❤️ your channel is one on my fav on youtube
Simply elegant.
このビデオ1本がもはや芸術作品。ほっこりさせていただきました。
What would you use these for or would you just eat them alone? I wonder bc of the sugar I assume they are sweet .
鉄玉子なんて初めて見た
Intrigued.
So rich :(:
I love your videos🤤🤤🤤❤️
Thank you for this! It's Mardi Gras season, so all things beans and rice are in season. That gold is a nice touch as it matches the colors.
This is so beautiful.
An Iron Egg?! I didn't know that even exist xD
They are not black enough. I make them with Doi Masaru recipe and cook 8 hours. They are beautiful and delicious. I serve them with gold leaves, too.
黒豆美味しいですよね！
止まらなくなるのが難点です｡
ちなみに鉄玉子の存在を初めて知って､詳細欄を見に行ったら作り方の最後の｢６、えんジョーイ！｣に初めて気づいてジワジワきました(笑)
真面目な文章の後にえんジョーイ！って……
えんジョーイ！って……！笑笑笑
When Chuck Norris has an egg
Aren't you supposed to throw away the soaking water? 🤔
My goose only lays golden eggs. That should work too right?
I'm pretty sure my mom made this a week ago!
3:22 oh......
aint nobody got time 4dat
I never get to comment this early! Anyway...I've never seen black beans cooked with sugar before. Is Kuromame meant to be a sweet dish/dessert?
You should collaborate with How to Basic
First like👍
👌
Can we sprinkle it with spices, or just the garnishing is sufficient?
an....iron egg?
Caraotas con Escarchitas
Those are the most majestic black beans I have ever seen
What helps adding iron egg?
he didnt change the water ☹
i'm broke, i can't afford those gold leaf :(
This Video has inspired me to "Skim The Scum" from MY LIFE. Best quote of 2019 YET.
これが、自然な色の黒豆なんですね。キレイ。

ところで、余った金粉は何に使うのかな…
完全菜食主義でクリームチーズ風の物体は作れますか？
soaking beans before cooking them is to remove indigestible complex sugars that cause gas. change the water after soaking. sieve them, remove the water they have been soaking in and pour in fresh water for boiling them.
京都っぽい...和風を感じられるような料理ですね😄❤️
CARAOTAS
iron egg? gold leaves? is this real life or what?? and wont your gas get over if you simmer it for 4 hours?? LOL. Anyway great video!
Your videos remind me of the ancient time when people lived a peaceful life!
it reminds me of natto
黒豆、そんなに好きではないけどなんか美味しそうって思いました❕d(`･∀･)b
今年のお正月、再チャレンジしてみます☀️
ところで、鉄玉子とは？動画見ててびっくりしました😲
おバカですいません🙏教えて貰えると嬉しいです🎵
これからも動画楽しみに待ってます(* ´ ▽ ` *)
ASMR
Yay 😍
Here’s a tip: Upload the videos beforehand so the quality isn’t hindered for early people. Just set it to  unlisted & then to Public.
かなりこだわりがある自分。
どの動画をみても妥協がなく、どのユーチューバーさんよりも画像が美しい。色合い最高。
ビーガンではありませんが、なんでもできちゃうりょうやさん、センスもよく、好きなものに囲まれ、贅沢に時間をかけ、自分に従い…こんな風に暮らしたいです。
can you plz upload your videos without the top & bottom black bar?

Amo tus videos
The art of boiling beans
Perfect as always ^^ why do you skim the skum please ?
Dang , I’m not the first!
I will absolutely watch a video of you simmering beans. I hate beans but I'd happily watch you simmering stones, too.
iron egg? what's that?
So beautiful
Gold Leaf? 😯
If I had gold, wouldn't put it on food😁✌️
i have no idea what happened in this video
I’m early for once!
Is it gold leaf crushed, coz here we get it covered between papers, in piece.
skim the skum
wow

を弄ってこの色味を出してるんだろうか
thanks for posting;)
Why iron egg
I was under the assumption that you weren't supposed to use the soaking water for cooking the beans, because it contains all of the harmful stuff that you try to remove from the beans by soaking them. Is this a misconception or just something you overlooked?
mmm
what is the point of the egg?
In the comments below, it was said that the iron egg is used to preserve the color of the beans, how else is this iron egg used?
I don't get it,  what's the iron egg for, and is it healthy to put it in a boiling water? And it the golden leaf 😅
Nice auto tune
where in the name of fucc do I get a gold leaf and an iron egg
What if I don't have an iron egg ?
still don’t understand the logic of eating gold. I mean, it’s not wrong but why?
Why the gold leaf?
Oooo before this video I got an Earrape Lego Movie trailer lucky me
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year Ryoya~~
Friend, why do you cook the beans with the iron egg? Can you explain me, please? Thank you!
The gold leaf leaves me a little disappointed...
That's it?.. you don't post for a long time then you upload a recipe for cooked black beans ?!
That nice feeling when you hold ur glass and ur hands becomes warm 😊
I know this is random but I’m going through a lot of bad stuff at the moment and this is the only stuff that helps my anxiety
Perhaps you could show us a tour of the finished kitchen? Loved watching you create your space~how about sharing the finished product~ ~PLEASE?
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
Thanks for the new video. Glad to see you back again❤
Thank you to be here🙏 I love everything about your channel. Your videos are much more than recipes. It’s really amazing how much peace it brings to me watching it. It is Art for the HeArt💛🙏 It is like a meditation. 
It is created with grace and humility by a beautiful human being you are who shares with his heart. In the most beautiful simple way. 
It is a ceremony. It is healing watching it. Thank you for the warmth, the simplicity, the peace..you bring to my heart🙏
I was just doing a marathon of your videos and now you've uploaded a new vid! Thanks Ryoya-san! ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful food! Beautiful cinematography! Beautiful editing! Beautiful hands!

明日大事なピアノの最後の試験で、もう不安で何も手につかない状態なのですが、この動画を見ると落ち着きます。
試験が終わったらこんなBGMの曲に挑戦してみたいです:D
You're back! ♡ Wonderful Video as always.
待ってましたー！途中のスライダーは手動ですよね？すごい滑らかに動きますね！
新キッチンの全貌も楽しみにしてます☆
京の暮らしはいかがですか。
いつも飲むほうじ茶が出てきて嬉しいです。香り高いほうじ茶をぜひ皆さんにも知ってほしいですね。
Glad to see that your back. Love your videos.
水仕事してる人の手ですね。
手の表情が好きです。
Great to see another one of your videos! It really brightens up my day.
There's warm & fuzzy feeling indirectly attached to this video
ホーローの鍋がかわいい
全体的に素敵な上に、最後の手を温めるシーンがとても良い…
AHHHHHH I love tea and I love your videos thank you so much for existing
Please know, that as an Australian...I truly and genuinely, appreciate, and love, the beauty in Japanese life. I adore your videos, and watching you make this, in itself, was peaceful :-D
What exactly IS "Hojicha"? Is it a tea? A green tea?
beautifully filmed as always!  I have a Hojicha Latte episode coming out too!!! :D
The piano music was a perfect accompaniment.
流行りのほうじ茶オレも自分で作れば濃さも甘さも調節できて良い✨
Omg how nice this is! 最近ほうじ茶にハマってて、家にちょうどほうじ茶の茶葉があるから早速ミルク買いに行って作ってみる！
Welcome back!!! The lightening in your new flat is really nice)) it makes new twist in your series))
Thank you for making such an amazing job)))
同じ茶園のほうじ茶を頂いてます
美味しいですね
動画エンディング、まさにGod handでした！
Your videos are amazing ❤️ 
You create magic 🔮

Thank you 🙏🏻
yummy!! my mother used to put eggs in it, so the eggs could cook in the boiling milk. But I think it's called Omelette here in France. Relaxing are the videos of yours, you must call your channel something like Relaxing Cuisine. thanks for watching now subscribe to this wonderful guy, you look italian by the way!!!
Me encanto!! Pero hubiera sido aún mejor sin música de fondo.
こんなに早く見れたの初めて！！！相変わらずおいしそう😋
最後に出てくるタンブラーのリンクがあれば教えて欲しいですm(_ _)m
Great video! The way you opened the almond milk blew my mind 🤯🤯🤯
寒い毎日、ほうじ茶ラテで温まります、動画ありがとうございます😊
エンジョーイ！😄
私もあやかって作ろうー
そして   エンジョーイしますぅ👍

watching you koock in this cold wether makes my heart worm thanks for such an art cuisine
Omg, I didn't realise you have now 1.6M followers! You deserve it so much. Thanks for your delicious recipes and your beautiful videos!
A few years ago I used to watch your videos all the time, and now I am catching up and I forgot how amazing they were! Keep up the good work. Just by watching them they bring up the feelings that I had back then.
Came over as soon as I saw it post lol. Great video btw and excited to see more from you😋😋😋😋😋
Thank you for doing this.
Merry Christmas and very best wishes for the new year!
This is visual therapy, thank you for sharing and happy new years⭐

Happy birthday 🎂
Blessed to see you again ^^
I fell in love with beautiful videos and am happy to find them . . . 😍
Beautiful ❤️❤️ I like how you filming
Watching peaceful cusine videos just make me smile
Isn't this kukicha instead of hojicha?

Hojicha is roasted and looks brown, and kukicha is the leftover leaves and stems of gyokuro green tea, which is what this looks like.
Beautiful but not really a recipe... 😅🤣
you finally uploaded a new video!  I have been waiting for a long time !
Just great - as always!!👍👌😋✨
Really thank you for new video !!
Thank you 😊  so good to see a beautiful  video from you.
Nowadays, some Korean cafes sell hojicha latte and I really love its taste. I also drink almond milk a lot at home so I should try this recipe! Thanks for good video!
Every time I tried to make myself some Hojicha it was so gross... after seeing this well I know that's because I did everything wrong x)
nice videos as always, thanks for sharing this. Have a good day
Yesss! Thank you! I love hojicha. Now the struggle to find a decent one on Amazon CA. LOL!
We just waiting for the new video so long time. Very nice~ #爆旋陀螺
Your clip really makes me feel peaceful and warm in winter
Always a joyful experience watching your videos.  I'll share this with all my friends at the tea bar I go to. Couple of questions: could I add tapioca pearls?  What other kinds of sweeteners do you think would work?
We missed you and your beautifully crafted vids.
Bro you are doing good job..... looking nice, video making style beautifull............... thank uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Love it, I have to try : )
you're back!!🙌🏻💛
I totally love how you made hojicha late☕️💛I love the background music

your videos are so healing <3
ほうじ茶もアーモンドミルクと煮られるなんて思ってもなかったでしょうね…







美味しそうです🤤
I love Japanese people.  Their attention to detail is exceptional.
ほうじ茶オレ最近流行ってますね☺✨
温まりそう～とっても美味しそうです👏💕
綺麗な動画だなぁ
Well you certainly made that look very yummy and comforting. Missed you. Great way to start my morning is with your peaceful music and videos
ほうじ茶ラテ、癒されますね～。
いつも美しい動画をありがとうございます。
Greetings from Germany!
Can you tell me how are the wonderfull pots and pans that you use called? And where can i purchase them?
And the portable gas cooker?
You make amazing estethic videos with delightfull recipes.
Thank you so much...
I don’t even know what hojicha is but I love your videos so much! Please upload more often. They are a cure for depression
thank you for that moment !
久々に 動画観れた♪
旅動画 タイムラプス待ってます～♪
Beautiful video and beautiful music, thank you very much
I subscribed this channel only because of those sounds & undisturbing calm music & simple,lone yet pretty background. Otherwise I'd never coz I don't think that the ingredients from their recipes are so easy to get. Impressed by your channel tho ♥
Where have you been ?
💙🕊💙
Perfect . . . .  Beautiful!
Merry Christmas~~💕 🎄😘
やっぱりRyoyaさんの動画がいちばん好き…
作った！美味しかったですー！
オリゴ糖いれました！
Bellissimo! Grazie💕
動画の雰囲気がもうおしゃれ…
エンジョーイ(ﾉ*°▽°)ﾉ
アーモンドミルクでほうじオレ美味しそうですね👏 是非参考にさせていただきます(๑>؂•̀๑)ﾃﾍﾍﾟﾛ

Woah Ive never thought to add milk to Hojicha. Mind blown.
Omg i have been buying  hojicha latte recently in Starbucks!  Thanks for sharing !
美味しそう！
テーブルの色、素敵ですね。
Love this channel 💜
THIS IS SO PEACEFUL ❤
Long time no see! :">
I'm more of your "No Music" videos, but after watching this I think I'll watch your videos with music more often. The music you used is just perfect. It's not a distraction, in fact, it helped make your video more relaxing... almost like a warm hug 😊
Can't wait to get notified about your next video 💕💕💕💕
すべての音がいい🎵
Wow! Didn't know you can do that with hojicha! It's my favourite green tea, I have to try it with milk :) thanks for the relaxing video and inspiration!
りょーやさん、こんにちは❄️
お元気ですか？りょーやさんのその手に包まれてるカップになりたーい😂
Спасибо за интересный рецепт
手が綺麗ですね🧤指も長いー
Beautifully filmed...luv the music!
MISSED YOU ❤️
富士ホーローのミルクパン‼️
買った頃がもはや、懐かしいくらい。
This is so nice 💕☺️ I prefer the taste of soya milk over almond milk though, would that still work well together?
Can I do it with other kinds of tea? If yes, which? 😍😋
Beautiful music...beautiful video....best night ever thank you for a wonderful video hugs and kisses
首を長くして待っておりました。いつも拝見させていただいています。りょうやさんの動画はいつも心が落ち着きます。
I missed you :"""""")
何気に調理ハサミがオールステンのものに変わってますね。
that last part is so cute ;;;;
oh my god, looks so good...<3
Ahh Ryoya-san, this is so amazing💞💞
I love these videos so much, thank you
久しぶりですね！待ってました！インスタのラテ写真ですね美味しそうです（＊＾＾＊）

👏👏👏😉
Long time no see that!
ほうじ茶飲めないのについつい見ちゃう
Hi! I was wondering if a hojicha tea can be in brown color as well? Because the japanase store that I always go to have the ones with brown color. it looks really warm and nice though! thanks for making such great quality videos both recipe and editing wise.
Welcome back senpai
お茶の中でほうじ茶が1番好き。
Hey i was wondering why you Are using a a7ii and gh5 when you have the A7sii? 🤔
I love Houjicha but my stash from my last visit to Japan just ran out :'(
Happy Birthday Ryoya-san!
This looks delicious. Also, I just watched this with my daughter and it put her to sleep! 😴 👶
緑の鍋☺素敵ですね🙆
毎回カップがオシャレなんじゃ〜
久々の動画で飛んで来たんだけどちょい手抜き…？
Clicks Like before watching, wants to click Like again after watching does not work sad panda face....watches again ! Happy Face.
音楽あると同じ動画でも雰囲気変わりますね
一つひとつの道具がおしゃれですね。お茶のオレは初めて知りました！とても興味あります。
差し支えなければ、道具の紹介もしてほしいです。
手を温めるところがほっこりしました☺️🙏🏻🌱✨
ほうじ茶オレ私も好きでよく市販のを飲んでます
２月に京都に行くので店で買ってきます🎵
久しぶりりょうやさん見れました✨京都はどうですか～😄
I added cinnamon and brown sugar syrup and it’s very comforting for winter ^^
Thanks Ryoyaa.... 👍😊
ほうじ茶、俺の作り方かと思ってやけに今回ワイルドだなと思いました
I miss you ;)
これ、牛乳でも作れるかな？☺️✨
where have you been? 😁
Yayyy it's been a long timeee
Thanks for making ;)
Ordered tea from amazon.  Can’t wait to try!
抹茶ラテも観たいなー
エンジョーイ!!
delicieux ! merci
I very much liked your video. Is there any other tea in which you would use this same method?
出てくる調理器具や食器がタイプです^ ^
この動画を見ていたら、子供の頃母が飲む都度ほうろくで焙じていた事を香りと一緒に思い出しました。
お久しぶりです！！！待ってました！！！！！更新ありがとうございます！！
甘味料ってなんですか…
art!
ほうじ茶の色がこんなに緑色だったっけ？
癒される😶🧡
beautiful like everytime.
I love the cup! Where is it from?
死ぬほど癒された
So calming 💛
I MISS YOU
houjicha with almond milk sounds like a really good idea because houjicha tastes quite nutty and roasty :D
Such peaceful cuisine.
love your videos😍😍😍😍
진짜 영상 보니까 맘이 진정해진다..
Soooo glad to see your video!!!
You have nice hands. :)
love it.
温まりそうですね☕︎💕作ってみます＾＾
Glad to see you back.. !!
<3
寒い時期にいいですね。ほっと心が和む動画でした。
いつも素敵な動画をありがとうございます。私も今度作ってみようかしら♪
I thought you would roast tea...
he's baaaaccckkkk
ちょうどほうじ茶買ってあるので今から作ってみます！エンジョーイ⸜(* ॑꒳ ॑*  )⸝⋆*
まったく、りょうやはお茶作るにしてもオシャレなんだよな〜
That looks delicious!
항상 한국에서도 잘 보고 있답니다. ^______^ 너무 영상이 아름답고 좋아요....나의 벤치마킹 NO.1 채널
Te quiero. 💜🌻
Thank you ❤️

What butane stove is that?
🍵❤️🙏🏻
Thanks Ryoya
I prefer your videos without music
完全菜食主義でクリームチーズ風の物体は作れますか？
Welcome back!
What a beautiful little pot 😊
手が…………きれい……
❤️❤️❤️
wait so is this milk tea?
Seems a bit wasteful of the tea. If you make the houjicha traditionally with a teapot you can reuse the leaves another few times!
Love your hand :)
動画楽しみにしてました。今回も真似して作ってみます^ ^ リョーヤさんのダウンベストと温かいラテで気持ちも温かくなりました。
What kind of scissors are those?
yayyyy finally
観ながらおいしそうで...ゴクリ...としてしました～　温まりそうですね( ´ω｀)

今年は大移動と新しいキッチンでの再出発ですね！
はじめて京都でむかえる冬でしょうか？

今年も素敵な作品をありがとうございました。
お体に気をつけて　よいお年を～♪
Amazing video
looks very tasty😋
Pls what hojicha leaves!?
I love your video)
新しいスタジオとお家のツアーはやりませんか？凄く楽しみにしてまーす
抹茶ラテは聞くけど,緑茶ラテは聞いたことないからこのレシピのほうじ茶を緑茶に置き換えても作ってみようかな
中国粉丝前来报道~
So lovelyyy
Would love to try it,never had it what does it taste like ?
Why did he put music in the vid????
nice video 👏. Could you please tell me the bgm？ It sounds great.
Does anyone else’s latte actually turned out to be more like milk infused with hojicha? Mine taste something like that. 🙃
Are you vegan?
im from Bali and always watched ur video...  i see ur bracelet .... that is from my country.  don't cut it, and let it broke by itself.  with that god will always protect you.  :) bdw love ur beautiful video
nice! I just watched both versions. I am wondering for the music version if you could try turning the actual sound (not music) much lower or make it mute? so that it is not competing with the music. I think that would be a good option :)
Can I just ask for more than 2videos a month? It is a pain to wait
Dear western dudes, in what kind of store can I find hojicha leaves?
Love hojicha
美味しそう♥甘味料は何入れたんですか？

Who else prefers these videos without music? Much more relaxing for me at least
The video is yellowish. Is it intentional or is it the color of the new house lighting?
Very nice ☺️
いつものように美しい動画。食い入るように拝見しました。
甘味料はなんだろう？　と考えました。
メープルシロップではほうじ茶の味と喧嘩しちゃうかな？　やっぱりきび砂糖のシロップかな？　と、あれこれ想像するのも楽しいです！
Hojicha tea is just green tea. Don’t get something else here.
エンジョーイ！
こんな風に中途半端に海外風のものとか食材使ったりするよりJunsKitchen さんみたいに清潔感あってかつ日本にはない海外風な感じがある方がよっぽどおしゃれな気がする。
今回も素敵な雰囲気の動画ですね。
そしてほうじ茶のオレもとても美味しそうです。
ちなみにオレンジガトーショコラの動画や今回の動画でも使用されている、計量スプーンはどちらで購入されましたか？とても可愛いものなので、もしよろしければ教えてください。
you used a dry measuring cup for a fluid? there’s a difference I believe
Good idea
04:25 Why hold the teacup like this?
It's not that we don't like the music versions, its that your shots are so well done and the audio is recorded so beautifully that having music detracts from the enjoyment. You're videos are wonderful.
You have the prettiest containers and utensils I've ever seen.
Unofficial ASMR king
I come to these videos whenever I am stressed or sad because they instantly make me happy again and calm
If you don’t know what Hoji-cha is, it’s roasted green tea. It tastes completely different that what you’d expect.
If there was a way to give a video a standing ovation, I would do so right now.
I strive to be as organized, ethical, and elegant in all my endeavors as you are in yours. You truly are a great inspiration for me.
I'm so grateful for your channel.  These videos inspired me to start cooking my own vegan and vegetarian food.  Now after a year I'm at a healthy weight with much better blood pressure!  Thank you!
I have a final exam tomorrow and when I saw this I stopped everything to watch your video.  You have no idea how much I appreciate the calmness of the videos you make.  It's perfection! 😍
I'm stopping everything else I'm doing atm. I had to watch this first, it's a must. Thank you Ryoya ;D
Thank you for this it made my day! I was having a particularly stressful day and these always help
My ears came for the first time
Ryoya is the only dude that got me whipped for a cooking video. I've never clicked a notification so fast. Always so well made and calming. Thank you ❤
I didn't know there was such a perfect way to pour water
Where does he buy his kitchen material? I want to get that pot for my Christmas present
Your attention to detail in these videos really eases a lot of stress and is so pleasing to watch. Great job! I love these sm💛
You have no clue how much I stan this Chanel omg
Still the best channel in the world.
Was studying for my last final that's tomorrow but this is the perfect break. So happy you uploaded!
I like your videos because it had no music. I like the natural sounds of pans clanking together, the scooping from a plastic bag, the water boiling, and what not
TIME FOR AN EAR ORGASM
待ってました🙈❤
ミルクパンかわいいですね🍳🍳
ほうじ茶ラテ私も好きです！アーモンドミルクで作ったのはどんな味になるんだろう！
After long time waiting. Finally! New video came out 😁
Much love from the Philippines 🇵🇭
Were your hands cold? I hope you are feeling better since you moved.......
So happy ❤️❤️
Perfect, always... 
Very Good Video.
Congratulations from Brazil! #dgtudo
Notification Squad! 
woohoo! I'm so glad you've uploaded ( thank you so much! )
This video stuck in my mind. I've watched it many times for the sake of the video. It was not only a recipe video, it was some sort of a story.  It was beautiful, tranquil, at the same time, lonely.  Everything was off centre, an imbalance feeling in the soul. Was the video made on your birthday? I wish your hands had been warmed by somebody's on your birthday.

I happened to find your channel.  I''ve started eating vegan food, and getting my life organised so that I can live beautifully as you do.
❣Hi, Ryoya, thank you for sharing! The right medicine at the right time to heal a cold. I hope I'll find this tea. A little Christmas present for myself. Love from Germany, Monika❣
I could listen to these all night.
And everything looks so good 😊
These videos truly peaceful
yes! ive been waiting for your videos!!!
Your videos always make me so excited. Thanks so much.  Hope to see the next one  sooner (long time for this video @@ ) 
If only I can taste your dishes...
Thx for sharing, love so much your videos, kitchen, utensils, subtlety, delicacy... ♡
Greetings from Barcelona, Spain 🌹.
その計量スプーン久々に見ました^_^
Your videos are so relaxing... Thank you for your amazing work ! Love from France
Your videos bring me so much peace and the food and drinks always look so delicious. Thankyou!! I'm glad you're back.
Welcome back, we missed you!.
Yes! Another video!! I watch these before bed and they always are SSOOO relaxing! Thanks for putting so much hard work and effort into making these :)
久しぶりの動画嬉しいです！待ってました💖
京都の寒さに負けず健やかにお過ごしください😊
i swear to god this dude loves Maple syrup more than anything lmao, im always waiting for him to pull out the Maple syrup to sweeten stuff 🤣
Thank you so much for doing these videos. They always calm me down and bring a smile to my face!
Your videos are always perfect. I'm absolutely in love since I found your channel💗
Would love to be your guest ... heheheheh
I'VE MISSED YOU! Also the end part <3.
2:13 b-b-but it's 200ml ;;;
anyway i still love it, thank you!
I just love watching your videos! There's something so calm and relaxing about them. Add to that fantastic recipes - just perfect! Thank you for sharing!
i always feel calm and cozy after watching your videos, thank you for that<3
يمي يمي 🤤
You indicated TABLEspoons.... sure you mean TEASPOONS of sweetener, right?
Your channel got me through exams freshman year. Thank you.
I was about to go to sleep, but then I saw the notification...guess I'm going to have to tell my bed to wait.
Such a nice video, perfect for the season. Cute Keep Cup!
these videos are always so cozy ❤ i always watch the music vs non music version because i need more of these videos :D
congratulations from Italy !!! come my guest ... here in Italy we are super for the kitchen and also the vegetarian / vegan one has many dishes ... excellent choice also for the coffee machine
🇮🇹👍🏻
I watched the video with the music and I love the peaceful sounds of the music along with the sounds of everything you do. Yours  truly are  peaceful cuisine videos.
You should collab with JunsKitchen!!!
Perfect Man...
I'm glad to see more videos from you. This was lovely, as always. I love learning about different types of teas, and this looks very satisfying!
beautiful video as always! thank you!
That ending = 🔥 10/10
Says 250ml Almond milk, only pours 200ml. :p
ほうじ茶ラテ気になってたんですけど、
牛乳が苦手なので作れてませんでした。
アーモンドミルクで作れるんですね！
作ってみようと思います🥰
The notifcation made me so happy! I missed the calming and attention grabbing vibe of your videos and i hope you keep making more for a long time. Thank you for the video and I hope you have a wonderful day!
Next video: How to make a fresh glass of tap water. I'm joking, love your style and phylosphy.
i missed your cooking videos! so soothing to watch :)
Are you Vegan? I too preferred the no soundtrack version.
Please make more videos...they relax me and I absolutely love them/you😍
your channel is my peaceful spot! i watch your videos whenever i'm stressed or sad and even though i'm not vegan, i love them!
I always appreciate the No Music videos. ASMR ! :D nice video
That sound quality!!! Eargasmic!!!
Aah seriously thank you for these videos. I’ve been very stressed about my art as of late, and about life occasionally, and I always get so happy when I see these in my sub box.
I’m going to try drawing today watching these. They always relax me, thank you for these!!
Thanks for uploading ;)
I see Peaceful Cuisine, I immediately click and like without even reading the full title. Love your videos always :D
It's SO nice to have you back :) Your videos are my happy place!!!
I just love your videos. They relax and inspire me so much. 😊
I always use my cup that filled with hot drinks to warm my hands as you do at the end of this video…and I have a exactly same keepcup 😆
I thought Hojicha was usually roasted/brown in color, not green?
No way. Guess whos back, he is back <3
Been a while Ryoya-san. This just made my day :)
I'm going to do that with kernels of roasted dates !
Nevere had this type of tea before, i just drink the generic green tea. Love to try this.
Your channel is the perfect thing to wind down with on a Sunday~ thx 
おつかれね(´･ω･)っ旦♥
Is that pot ceramic? Does anyone know where I could find something similar not on Amazon?(I don't like how much packaging Amazon products come in)
this was so comforting to watch, thank you :)
Beautifully shot. Thank you for this
After following you for years, each time I enter the kitchen (even for a cup of tea) I slowly make everything and even make such sounds as those and it all becomes such a peaceful exprience. As always thank you for the efforts.
Orgasm wowww 
                                          #dgtudo
'2 to 4 tbsp sweetener' pours in 1/2 a tsp
this is the best way to spend your day off.. relax and watch thid vid...
That was not 2-4 Tablespoons of sweetener. Guessing you meant Teaspoon
Okay so I honestly do not know half the dishes but I'm here for the video.. The cinematography. Just beautiful.
Your videos feel so calm, they're always nice to watch! But I guess that's where your name comes from cx
Yay! Finally I have been waiting for this!
I'm a simple man. I see Peaceful Cuisine , I hit 'LIKE'.
Ultra wide aspect, very nice Ryoya san
..and thanks for making this video 💚
I'm not vegan, but in every single video I see, the food you make looks very tasty! In many times I wish I can make some of your recipes, thank you for your work. For me, is not only food, it’s art <3
Such an aesthetic pleasure to watch your videos
Not really liking the super wide, movie like aspect ratio. I think a regular 16:9 is better for this type of video.
Oooh I love Hojicha this looks really good
ahh finally!! been waiting a bit too long for a new video
The ending was good – the sound of you sipping the 🍵
Beautiful video thanx for sharing 😍👍
Just beautiful. Thank you.
Add 250ml almond milk adds 200ml Man wtf
Do you know the feeling when someone not so often loads up videos, but those ones are really well prepared
never disappointing ;)❤
You cooking again! I miss you videos cooking haha
This is very addictive more please, great for calming anxiety.
Honestly this is my favorite cooking channel and cinematography channel all in one.  Bravo!!! 👏👏👏👏👏
Thanks I genuinely needed a destress today!
I feel so calm and Happy after watching your videos
And yes your kitchen is my dream kitchen ❤️
U made many people's day :) Thx!
The only ASMR i like ❤️
can you make green tea latte? please?
落ち着いたらまた部屋のツアーして下さい！
前のも好きでした！
What you do is great work! i permission to download your video and use some of sounds mate ! Thanks
I love these videos 😍
Me a person who will never be able to make these recipes watches the videos every week.
It's cold here. I can feel warmth on my fingertips on the last scene. Cinema magic. goes off to find hojicha tea
I've been waiting for so long!
Can someone please describe wha this taste like I can only imagine it!😂😞
1:24 ACK!  You cannot just throw tea into boiling water!  I adore your videos and I know I will get hate for correcting you, but this is a no no.  Tea should go into water 180F or less for some.  It does affect the flavor and health benefits.
I think that camera positioning and everything takes a lot more time than actual cooking. Lol!
Ryoya if visit UK You are welcome to stay with my family 💞
Love the ASMR
I wish you know what you are doing in our lives... You are such an inspiration😍
i wish this was longer... its so peaceful
I love the way you do things.
Another great video! How is your skin condition since the move?
This is the best ASMR video lol
I am outside of Washington dc. Where can i find this tea?
Your videos are my cure to insomnia. :)
Prettiest hands on YouTube
this is like free therapy thank you <3
nothing better than some milk tea.
So calming, I love your content.
do you think this would taste okay with other kinds of tea?
this recipe is easy enough and i have all equipment needed in my dorm, except the hojicha leaves.... i plan to buy it and give this recipe a try!
no music squad, where are you at?
茶漉しを斜めにして切るとこがプロっぽい
It's a beautiful San Francisco Christmas morning only made better by this calming video...
This is the real ASMR for me, and not those cringy people eating things
I’m so glad you have started to make more of these no music videos. Please continue to do so! I always watch them before bed to relax myself.
For a second I thought you put rum instead of sweetener into the tea. Wonder if that would be tasty with almond milk
is this the first cooking video in your new apartment? i wondered why i didn't recognise the table!
No music gang 😎✊🏻
良いほうじ茶ですね。うちにあるほうじ茶なんて色の濃い藁みたいですよ…。
I have never heard of Hojicha before but I will definitely check it out and try to find it where I live! thanks <3
I love these videos for so many reasons. Whenever I'm stressed, or upset, or anxious, these videos are so helpful. I normally don't go for ASMR videos, but these videos are perfect and so calming. Not to mention, I am currently studying Japanese, and your videos help me to learn new verbs and even kanji. Now I can read "tablespoon" and "teaspoon", as well as "water". Thank you so much for making this channel and these videos. どうもありがとうございます。
I watched a guy making a cup of tea at 3am. Not that i regret it. It warms my heart.
Happy Holidays to you Ryoya!
Thanks for encouraging me to google hojicha!
このカップ、蓋があったのですね🤭以前はアイスクリームの器で使用されてたかな？便利そうですね(^^)
りょーやさんのシュトーレン動画に移動しよーっと♫
ahah I missed this channel
I dropped everything when i saw the notification
Yum.. ASMR
I AM HERE FOR HIS ROLLED SLEEVES AND HANDS ALDOXORG
Our simple and magical friend cook is back! : )
Do you enjoy maing these kind of videos?
sometimes i wonder, do you be in this peace too when you cook?
This video is a spiritual experience
綾也さんと一緒に飲んでみたいですね＾＾そしたら…きっと心も温まるんでしょうね…💕
Does this recipe work the same with genmaicha?
Thank you for your dedication to make beautifully produced videos and gorgeous healthy food for our watching enjoyment. You are deeply appreciated.
作業音が心地いいです。手大きいですね^ ^
Love the ending!

最後のほうじ茶ラテで手をあたためながら飲むシーン、なんかすごく良いです☕映画見てるような気分🎦
awesome. will use this for tons of tea lattes :))) i learn so much from you, thanks
So peaceful to watch 👌
Muy relajante...
That hojicha has a really nice packaging.
おうち、どれくらい完成したのか気になる
Thanks Ryoya 🤗
Yayyy!!!!! Finally!!!!
me encantan tus videos!
Dear Ryoya, thank you for the quality and elegance of your videos. If I may make a suggestion, I would like to point out that it would be a great example for all the viewers if you could use tap water instead of bottled water and point the way in helping to reduce single use plastic containers. Thank you once more for your work! All the best!
音楽無しの方が好き。
I’m more aware of the choices I make when I eat, I’m consciously trying to eat vegan food. Thanks for making these inspiring videos!
your videos have the vibe of a real life ghibli movie
yessss
I want my whole life to be this peaceful 😌😌😌
At 1:40 it’s sooo aesthetically pleasing (love all your no music videos, they’re so calming!!)
Exquisite!
Does it matter if its a different type of leaves?

I know where that three colored bracelet from...
I want to make this.
It looks very expensive.
I don't know why but I want to hold your hands at the end and make sure your hands are warm.
今度作ってみます！
Hello !
Glad to see you again. I would like to make hojicha tea. I can find hojicha roasted tea and yours is so green. BTW i'm in french, perhaps very hard to find these tea here ?
牛乳苦手なんでアーモンドミルクなら飲めるから作ってみます

Nice!
😂😂
Has anyone tried this? Does it taste well? I have no idea how kojicha leaves taste 🤔
Does anyone know where i can buy one of those mugs he had at the end of the video?
마지막에 손으로 감싸는게 너무 좋다... 내 손이 따뜻해지는 느낌...
New vid. Yaaaayyyyyyyy

Second!
Miss ur videos

Is it possible to have ASMR videos with the color grade of the ones with music?
So Beautiful
What does it taste like?
I don’t know what it is when I read the tittle, but I have to watch the video 😊
Maple Syrup at 3:47 !!!
dont call the music version the 'original version'. this is the original!
Hi Ryoya from London UK ❣
is it possible for you to post a link for where to buy your gas burner? i love the way the flame is dispersed over the outer ring instead of being 5 or 6 little flames. Seems like a much more efficient way to heat the food evenly and to give you more control...
What kind of cup is that and/or where can I get it?
カットが非常に良い
アーモンドミルク以外だと、どんなミルクがほうじ茶との相性いいですかね？
Third
こんにちは、いつも素敵な映像をありがとうございます。私もいつもアーモンドミルクを使いますが、コーヒーやお茶に混ぜたり、ホットチョコレートを水とアーモンドミルク半々で作ろうとすると分離します。
焙じラテでは分離しませんでしたか？ちなみにわたしはUKに住んでいていろいろ試しましたが、普通のPlants basedミルクはよく分離するのでいい方法がないかなぁと思っています。もしいいTipsがあれば教えてくださいね。
Your videos are a treat to watch.
Wow looks like im watching a classic movie... Lol amazing video
Good.

Why do you boil the TEA? Tea cannot be boiled. Great videos. Thanks.
ah, ryoya, how did you know i love hojicha? perfect for the cold weather here ☺️ i'll have to find some good quality hojicha soon and make this!! always thankful for and inspired by your videos!!
As a mexican I generally hate "taco" videos, but this was truly delightful, with all the propper details cared for, like toasting the ingredients for the salsa, and the chopped onion and coriander on top, with lime juice. The tortillas were beautifully done too.
I'm so so happy you're back, missed your videos a lot.
😱 His tortillas were inflated!!!! According to the ancient tradition, once you can do that, you're ready to get married. 😁
I'm mexican, and let me tell you that I almost cried when you were making the tortillas. Those tacos are incredibles, and I was so surprised at the fact that you used onion, cilantro and lime, that's how you eat a real taco, and OMG the salsa, man that's how we do the salsa on our home, just... I'm amazed, I'll definetly gonna make this, thank you. ♡
I trust his hands more than I trust my own kitchen utensils.
As soon as i saw how you made the salsa, i was like "yes, mexican approved"
Lol this song along with the video makes me feel like I’m watching something incredibly dramatic and idk I somehow feel like he’s making love in the kitchen with his ingredients but he’ll never feel that same joy he felt making them with his wife whom died several years ago but taught him what it means to love and be happy and now that she’s gone there’s a hole in his heart that can never be filled by anything but cooking, of which he and his wife used to enjoy doing together religiously. And so now his vegan taco recipe helps him feel closer to her but he can’t do it without having an emotional break-down because he misses her so much yet he pushes through and now I wanna sob 😭😭
It's pretty surreal when a man from so far away in the world uses salt from so close to my hometown. It might not mean much to most people, but it's pretty amazing for me to know that connection!
This is better than meditation
You are amazing! Your videos are anxiety medicine and the recipes look so yummy!
I started tearing up when he started making the tortillas. I’m not sure why lol but anyway I loved the video the camera work was beautiful as always
Amigo! you executed making those corn tortillas from scratch like a boss.......well done these "vegan Tacos" look amazing.
Will you release your book in English already ?
Very authentic salsa and tortillas. And garnishment  And appreciate the vegan twist! Well done
As a vegan and Mexican this is 100% correct! I can belived a japaness can get a taco receipt more perfect than Americans who live right next to us. 👏 If you are vegan and want tacos you should totally give this receipt a try, this is the correct way.
That's the most amazing salsa I have ever seen in a non mexican channel, you did it in the traditional way 
And with hand made tortillas ! 😲😋
Love your video !
I just realized that all his videos are of vegan food. I found this channel and have been watching a bunch of vegan channels that were recommended and have really gotten into it. I guess your the reason I went vegan!
Tempeh is a traditional soy product originating from Indonesia. It is made by a natural culturing and controlled fermentation process that binds soybeans into a cake form. delicious :)
YESSS i never clicked so fast!
Woww you totally mastered the hand made tortillas 👏🤗 👏every single detail in correspondence to the way we prepare tacos 👏👏👏 delighted with the Mexican salsa 👏👏👏 Greetings from Mexico 🍉🌵🌶
The music was well chosen. Good job As always, glad to see you settled in into your new home.
I never know how easy is that to make tortillas. 

No instant ingredients, all home made, except for tempeh, taught me the beauty of process of something.
いつも新しい食材に出会う
It feels like I just watched a symphony. "Peacefull Quisine" guy is the Mozart of food....
It is really strange as an Indonesian to see tempeh packaged in a box 😅
Sigh... this is beautiful! I was getting nervous when I didn’t see lime anywhere, but it was okay when you used it at the end lol. I am a plant based Mexican and I approve this message 😍👍.
Just like real tacos!!
Woow! The salsa, the cebolla and cilantro, the tortillas, everything just like I do in home. Thanks for sharing a little bit of  my México with the world. You're amazing!!
Toutes tes vidéos sont très stimulantes. Merci 🙏
Perfeito! Um espetáculo!  
Maravilhosos seus vídeos! 
Impossível não amar!  Obrigado! 
Sucesso. Abraços do Brasil!
What a great way to chill on this rainy Saturday 😌
It's not everyday that I actually know what you're doing and not just that but also have plenty of experience making what you made (salsa and tortillas). It made me very happy to see someone make tortillas exactly like I have been making them my entire life. I do however add a tiny bit of vinegar to my salsa and I use jalapeños instead but that's just my personal preference. This looked so tasty.
Ooo I missed your videos so much! 💕
I like this kind of clean way of cooking, and the music is really great match!
I love your videos ❤️ I'm Mexican and I approve this btw 😍
Since this is only my second ever YT comment and I am posting it so late, I am not sure if you will actually see it. But I love your videos. You truly have a gift for capturing the simple beauty and joy that is present all around us. Thank you for continuing to create content.
I approve this tacos, if you ever want to make the salsa spicier you can roll the chillis against a surface with a little presure on and roast them, btw I'm mexican
Sashiburi Ryoya-san 👋👋🤓🤓👌👌👍👍
the music with this video reminds me of Hannibal cooking scene XD
This is food poetry
ヴィーガンでも何でもないけど雰囲気が好きで見てますw
I missed these.
the chili paste called in Algeria 🇩🇿 Hemis... Withe oliv oil the flavor will take you to the heaven 😋
Hi dear, I like your clip and I will follow you forever please keep doing this I am your fan from Thailand thank you very much for such good techniqe 😍😍xxxx
the mexicans approve, congrats, they are just like we cook them
When i saw how you made the tortillas you got a point ;-; then you actually let them get inflated thats another point, you made salsa and served them with onion and cilantro thats one point... but the lemon... the right kind of lemon... those were like +100000 points for me 👏🏼😪🤤 thankyou for making this recipe so nostalgic and amazing🇲🇽❤️
I love the camerawork better than last video.
Great videos ryoya-san !
Good choices of music too
I like the tacos with grill mushrooms!! 🙋🏼‍♀️😋😋, you only need  to marinade in olive oil and balsamic vinager, onion powder and garic
Please use a wooden tool because it's awful to hear the sound in 10:00 - 10:20.
That Cool!! Very good video !!!   Beautiful!! 
Congratulations!!! Like
Good afternoon!
Success always!
I came across your videos today, absolutely love your concept. My two boys (3&2yrs) and I watching over breakfast and they're so excited to recreate your dishes. Our new fave cooking channel. New Subs here!
wow! you own multiple kramer knives! the best knives in the world! how expensive were those!? I know you can only get them through auction.
I tried this last year, and it's been my family's favourite since! Even my dad, a meat lover, loves this. Thank you for sharing this recipe to the world.
That's a weird looking tempe 😁
.
Greetings from Indonesia👋 new subscriber here. I'm not a vegan but I find your videos so relaxing. Love them 👍
I enjoyed so much watching you make everything from scratch <3 lovely chanel
Un saludo desde México 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
一つ一つの調理器具に拘りがあって、凄いお金掛かってそうだね(°_°)
Does anyone else get Studio Ghibli vibes from the music he uses in his videos? SO peaceful <3 Thank you so much.
Your knife looks like Alice's vorpal blade lol. From Alice Madness returns and I love it ❣
Black Tempeh! <3 never seen it before!
I definitely admire the grace and beauty of his cooking and knife skills, but look at that knife? It’s beautiful, and the cutting board, aw - I would love a link to purchase them, thank you. Stunning Kitchen artistry!
I am so glad tht I hav found your channel...😍😍
Hello Friend!!  Perfect...
Delicious, always!!
Success! Hugs from Brazil... #dgtudo
That looks delicious! Exceptionally so.. Waited so long for your videos...please post more about your trips and if you learnt to cook something new there..
I lost it when Ryoya pulled out the tortillera as he was making homemade tortillas! How amazing is that?!!!! 😭😱 
This video was beautifully done! He definitely put so much time && research to create this video. Thank you for all your hard work!
I'm so happy!! You made this perfectly!! When I saw the tortillas being done correctly I screamed! I'm super proud!!
If Studio Ghibli produced a cooking show... they would make this.
Yes sir! You really kept the essence of a REAL mexican taco. Thank you for that.
Hi....would you make video how to make
Japanese tempeh......sir.....
Arigato gojaimasu..
Looks delicious~
Greetings from Mexico 😀
Thank and for the Beautiful 🌷 Music!
Asmr + cooking + relaxation music =  Happiness
The world is behind me when I watch you work.  The healing energy is simply amazing.  Thank you : )
May i know what Spatula brand you using?? Im looking for one that can use to cook and also mix things. Looking forward to your reply.
After having remained
Hang this to the rice; and of Okinawa why don't image it?
Because it is the high seeing and hearing number of times, this animation shares it.
RADIOAYA🐮SNS
When you're cook but at the same time wants to make a movie
I never know that making tacos can be this emotional... T.T

Idk if it was called Salsa, Sauce or Sambal, but i'll put more to it 👍👍
I love your videos! Not to get just some cool recipe ideas, but to calm down and get in a peaceful mood. Your channel name fits perfectly.
Amazing video like always !May I ask What Knife brand do you use ? Specifically the Damascus steel one :)
Incredible. This channel is so amazing. -🥑#veganstrong

Muito amor por essa faca <3
This is a taco!! Gracias, muchas gracias. Made my heart warm. Man this video is gold. Reminded me of Sunday mornings with my mom. When you were making the tortillas, I felt a little emotional
I love the imperfections of organizing things in this video! It reminds me of the old day when you were trying different recipes and techniques. Thank you so much for making videos!
taking a break from studying and absolutely loved how this video bought me some peace, loved it!
I like the sound... chopping,crushing, baking, peeling
in love with that knife..
I am Mexican born and raised just one word RESPECT!!!
¿Alguien sabe que fue lo que puso de relleno? Parecían frijoles.
Jejeje saludos desde Mexico
Who can choose such an elegant music for TACOS LOL
Thanks for watching?

You're amazing. I have been watching you for a long time, but never commented and now I want to thank you for doing what you do because it helps a lot of people in stress. Your videos are art. Thanks!!
Such a joy to watch this new video. 
Peaceful for sure.🍃
The sound of the toasted garlic is so satisfying.
Been awhile Ryoya-san!  Your videos always calm my anxiety. Greetings from PH 🙌

The most cinematic and aesthetically pleasing video on earth . this is basically asmr
Quel bonheur... tellement relaxant 🙏

An indonesian Food, Tempe(tempeh)
Oishii
I just found your channel and wow... I don't know why I have tears in my eyes. This was incredibly beautiful and as a Mexican, I agree with the other comments amazed at the details and care you put into these tacos. I'm going to attempt to make these this weekend. Thank you for this channel...new subscriber here.
as a mexican it made me extremely happy that u made the tortillas w lots of love instead of just using the pre-made kind, thank u for ur videos
..PERFECTION!..
👏🇲🇽👏🇲🇽👏
elaboración perfecta , pero , que es el ingrediente principal que fríes ?
if you can put some avocado puree on the bottom first ,
Your videos are so gentle and calming :)
I knew he was vegan. I noticed when he used that metal straw on his coffee video
bro i'm a new subscriber and i love your channel. its beyond what other channels do and its versatile. love from ladakh .....
I'm not vegan but those tacos look amazing.
Lovely! Orchestrated  like a true  meistro! You got us salivating!
When I tell people about your channel I always say you make me hear things I’ve never noticed when I’m cooking, I think that’s why it is so relaxing. Wonderful job as always ♥️ it’s just a bonus that you make vegan recipes!
Why am I getting emotional over vegan tacos
Quite relaxing and the colour combination is perfect! I hope you enjoy making them as much we enjoy watching them. Quite amazing.
Oh man got everything but the Masa and Tempe. Gonna try this! :D
I liked the video but I didn’t just like it I LOVED IT .i just respect you, those actually look like some good tacos from a non Mexican channel ,buen trabajo 👍👍👍😻
everything you do is made with love, and it shows.
love your videos <3
Tempe goreng is the best! 😍✨
It's so yummy Rhoya .. 👍😊..but sorry to say ..😬 I feel sad to hear that sounds..
Missing your videos, happy to see your conquer one of the mexico famous dishes!
Beautifully done as always. Didn't know they had black tempeh. Delish!
BGMで凄い癒されます。
So I'm off from work for the day and  just got up from a quick nap. I must say, getting up to this was more relaxing than the sleep. The meal looked simply tasteful and delightful
Wonderful and delicious looking tacos. Thank you.
I love your videos so much, its like therapy :) Also your knife was so cool!
As always, amazing recipe! Try making Indian food sometime?
ASMR Cooking :)
I LOVE TEMPEH
also I thought he was just going to use some premade tortillas like the pita bread in the hummus video and then he brought out the masa and i was like OH NICE
great video loved it
Fresh tortillas,?? Yep we approve 👌👌👌👌👌♥️♥️
Wish you had a show on Netflix!! That would be so awesome!!!!
For the tortillas making... use your hands 👌🏼
this channel is genius. literally asmr with cooking
Bring diagonals back, man!
Very relaxing-- thank you!
what a peaceful life! I miss your old kitchen <3
Very accurate and lovely video! this is how we make tacos here <3
Beautifull, as always. I do admire how you took every single frame in this video. It must be amazing skill then, yet it looks so yummy for me. :)
Thanks for this new beautiful video 😊😊
this is art. thank you!
Those tortillas were inflated, WELL DONE! 👏🏼👏🏼
the moment i saw him using tempeh, istg i screamed so loud cuz that's my childhood comfort food lmao
I'm so glad you're back!! :D

Yaaaay cooking in the new studio! How are you liking the new space?
omg I just found this awesome channel 👍
I've been wanting for your videos so much
love your acc so much ><❤❤❤
初めまして！

素晴らし動画で最後まで見入ってしまいました。

料理もさておきながら､何かのPVを見ているかの様な気分になりました。

しかし料理美味しそ～😊
Se ven bien , pero seria interesante probar el sabor (y)
Love your videos, so relaxing and it’s vegan!!!!
Beautiful job. Thank you so much. ❤️
All of sudden Gordon Ramsey swears..
ahhh long time no seeeeeeee, waiting for your video so long, misssed ur video so muchhhh
Nice to see you back from your adventures. 😊
Genius recipe! I didn't know there where black bean tempeh. Awesome! :)
a big Hug from Mexico, love ur videos.
it's been amazing to watch someone who's not Mexican doing such a great job, don't misunderstand me, but most of foreigners think that taco bell tacos are real tacos. But when I saw you using the prensa and making the sauce from scratch was kinda warm to my heart. I wouldn't hesitate to taste your tacos at all. Thanks for sharing! 😊
You can try next time adding a bit of cilantro to the salsa, it's very tasty!
Watching the video is not what I rely on anymore, the calm sound! :3
You are full of elegance and grace. Thanks for sharing your qualities 🍁
Is that tempe who made by edamame ? So big
Hola - Amazingly good. You nailed it so well and I appreciate it so much. Thanks for your hard work :) I could see you actually knew what you were doing and those tortillas ended up looking better than the ones I do — me being from Mexico I still have lots to improve regarding masa. Thanks! Congrats!
I swear, EVERY. SINGLE. VIDEO of yours  I find myself with my mouth hanging open on the verge of drooling at the end. Every time! And I tell myself I'm not going to do it next time... I'm stronger than this! Goodness it just all looks so delicious! 🤤🤤😋
I love tacos . Thank U ❤️🌱🇲🇽
This time your music makes me cry! So sad and nostalgic! But your sauce is totally Mexican, and your tortillas are perfect, The same way! I think you visited México😘Amazing recipe! Love from México! ♥👌
When I saw the headline I assumed it wouldn't be done with corn tortillas (they're vegan, but most use a substitute) but was pleasantly surprised by you making them yourself and the salsa and everything else. I love your videos anyway, but this one was top notch,  maybe bc it hit close to home.😁😊
im meant to be studying for my physics test tommorow, but i gotta watch some peaceful cuisine
Your channel is peaceful, just like its name. 😊 I’m originally from Honduras and those tortillas were wonderfully made.
This channel is well titled...I do feel peace watching you cook.  :0 )
Im Mexican and i can say one thing. I'M VERY PROUD OF YOUR WAY TO USE THE "PRENSA" FOR MAKING TORTILLAS! ✨
For anybody that actually knows how to make tortilla, knows that making the air between the tortilla itself it's really hard!, I'm impressed, you have made justice to Mexican culture
Glad you're back! Missed your videos
your videos always makes me so clam and happy ♥ thank you
Beautiful ❤️🌮❤️
Damn you inspire me so much brother. You are artist
You enjoy tacos bredren my goodness 😂
He has the most beautiful spoons & cookware... so relaxing it can almost put you to sleep. I love how clean and neat he is.
What a fancy tempeh u got there. In my place people sell tempe wrapped in coconut leaves.
truly peaceful to watch Ryoya... you are a inspiration.. the salsa u made in the beginning is called as spicy tomato chutney in India.. Its a amazing and most favourite combo for our steamed idlis made out of rice..
I am totally obsessed with this channel!
HERMOSO! Le falto aguacatito jejejee
1000 years of Mexican culinary tradition are proud of this magnificent and delightful video. 😥👍
This is the first time I see tempeh that beautiful
Ninassan konitchiwa 🌮🌮🌮🌮what  a beautiful  japan  knife !!!!!🔪🔪🔪
Beside your food always looking delish. Your videos are just beautiful!
Those are some fancy tempeh. I love them here in Indonesia, taste so much like meat if you know how to cook them
Wow that's... That's an unusual-looking Tempe...
Tus vídeos son asombrosos, gracias por la receta.
As a Mexican I love how you respect Mexican Cousine and you didn't make the "tacos"  American Version that everybody think are the real tacos , well done. Thank you.
This video is just what I needed for the very stressful day I had. Thank you for sharing it with us.
9:54 Mijo, you can married.
love every second of your videos ... and  have so much pleasure just watching your wonderful videos ... and if I  taste your culinary art in real life art I would definitely have an orgasm ...  Ryoya thanks for bringing pleasure and joy....
エンジョーイ！が可愛い(*^^*)
To everyone who hasn’t tried tempeh, please give them a try even if you’re not vegan! They are a wonderful protein alternative for curries, stir fries etc. I personally love them more than tofu.
These are some authentic and legit tacos. Greetings from Mexico!
Hi!! Where can i buy your cutter board? Please😊
先週の金曜日ぐらいに中之島の辺りでで見かけました笑(声かけていいかわからなくて結局声かけてないですけど...)

いつも動画みてて生き方に憧れてます笑

次の動画も楽しみにしてます！
I love tacos i love totillas .
you're back!!! this makes me so happy
Your videos are magnificent!
Please upload more cooking videos! Love from Malaysia!
なんか初めて見た道具がいっぱい！！
今回も美味しそう
Love your videos! Keep uploading
Oh my gosh, your videos are LIFE.
Its nice to see your vlog again, your videos inspire many for making a good dish 🤗
Wow 13 minutes went by so fast! I was so entranced by the cooking and relaxing music.
My love for this channel has surpassed anything else
Edit: this is how you make tortillas! First video that I've seen that illustrates it very well
I need one of those flat cast iron skillets.
Here I come Whole Foods to get Tempeth. Looks like fried "chicharrones" oh God I want to try it bad. Thanks.
i miss you Ryoya, come back!!
this video is sad to watch, especially using the tempeh to substitute for meat. I'm happy im not vegetarian or vegan.
Your salsa is perfect. Definitely making this version next time!
How is your experience living as a vegan in Japan? I'm a vegetarian living in Tokyo and it's quite hard, as not many restaurants list all the ingredients etc.
I only just noticed the damascus steel knife, awesome! Alec Steele forges some great blades.
Great work!✨✨Looks very delicious:) 
Good food →Good vibes→ Good day🌞
Thank you very much 🙏✨✨
💜 Desde Argentina. Me encantan tus videos!
Hi, I follow your videos from the start of your channels; I'm Mexican and it's the first time I've seen tacos in such an aesthetic way. They look delicious!!! I recommend that when you come back to prepare it
Ughh.. been sick for a couple days and haven't eaten anything. Looks good 👍
i missed your cooking videos!!
美味しそううううううううう！
カッティングボードの作家さん観てるかなぁ😊
シラントロなんてシラントロ
I became vegan after watching this channel
癒しでしかないです👏 so therapeutic✨
I remember that beautiful chopping board from an unboxing video.
I don´t want to imagine all the thing you have to clean after you record the video. Otherwise, amazing like always 😊
My eyes shone as soon as I saw this video on my feed
Literally started crying from how beautiful this is
Tempeeee...yess..
مين نام معايا 😪
روقان للاخر ..
綾也さんの動画が久しぶりでめちゃくちゃ嬉しいです☆しかもとても美味しそう♡♡
We miss youu!!
昔のフィルム映画って感じがしてすごく素敵
Loving the new workspace!! And of course the ever-so-therapeutic videos!
You need cumin, amigo.
エンジョーイ！
概要欄観てたら(笑)
My god knows i won’t turn vegan but...
All his videos and recipes are so well made?
(I have tried my hand at making some of the dishes before too! And as a horrid cook I can assure you they taste really good!)
I don’t know. 
It is like— come into this channel. Cleanse your soul with the aesthetic 
And your body with the delicious food. 😂
I accidentally found your channel today...チャイティーの時はインド人から絶賛のコメントが殺到して、タコスの時はメキシコ人から絶賛のコメントが殺到してて凄い方だなぁと感動しちゃいました😳サルサソース参考にさせて頂きます🌮Liked it👍
seems to be missing some cumin powder, don't think I ever had a taco where the meat did not have a little bit on it. But that just might be a regional thing
Any chance of doing a fermented or stinky tofu recipe??? 😁
Will you ever release your book in English?
Good to have you back sir.
ドイツの方に頂いたボードがいいですね！お料理がより映えますね✨
The tempeh is beautiful!
可愛いフライパン✨
そのまま盛り付けてテーブルに出しても良さそうな！
Those Organic Tomatoes in the beginning <3
パクチー苦手なんですが大葉か三つ葉でも大丈夫ですか？
I love how the tempeh looks. Its beans are more big than normally i saw
Great video, wonderful music and even more amazing chef
Thanks for peaceful video :)
You should definitely consider joining Master Chef since you know a lot of making things in scratch. Those tacos look amazingg
Finally a new recipe video!
Tempe i love you ❤️😂
Tempenya lucu haha
It was so great seeing you maked that tortillas from scratch and not using some stupid taco bell shell version for your tacos, they look so appetitazing!!
Tempe 😍
I would need 3 times more salsa🤣
にんにく使う時
にんにくの皮が上手く向けなくて
(･д･)ﾁｯってなっちゃう...w
Hermoso! Bravo! 👏
We don't deserve this quality content
can u make omurice :D?
使用している曲はyoutubeで普通に調べたりすれば出てきますか？💭 
どのような曲なのか知りたいです。
淡々と作る姿がかっこいいです。
Taco-Friday was yesterday 😅🌮
SO THATS HOW TEMPE LOOKS LIKE IN FOREIGN COUNTRY.
maybe bcs im too used to indonesia’s tempe, the tempe that is used in this video is really weird looking lol. the beans are so big and round, also we rarely have black tempes. 
it is so interesting to see the difference!!
Fanciest tempeh I have ever seen.
Is anyone uncomfortable because of the tempeh
なんか映画のワンシーンを見ているような気分
おしゃれ…
I have never seen tacos done this way.  it was very interesting to watch and I bet it tastes delicious.
I’ve just ate dinner....why am I so hungry right now....
It took me a while to watch this video bc "taco" videos normally make me cringe a little, but this was so perfect. Thanks for being respectful and making dignified tacos :D
I missed you. :)
Im from ind , and thats tempeh looks different
How do you eat taco? Wrap it first?? I never eat taco
As soon as the tortilla started bubbling, you gained my respect and admiration.
First video I ever watched of yours and I have to say. I am feeling very relaxed now :) Great video
The time has come and so have I.
Weon creí que habría más comentarios en español... ¿Qué chucha? (?
japanese tacos, no tacos. but thanks is very interesting your version of tacos!
Me eché un taco de ojo (;
Music is on point, cozy vibe of the kitchen, and some delicious vegan tacos! What else can you ask for? ❤
My questions are, where did you buy the tempeh, and how could those be vacuum-packed? The beans used to make tempeh are bound with Rhizopus "mold", which isn't the "obligate anaerob" type of microorganism. Therefore, the "mold" needs a little amount of air in order to turn beans into tempeh
Tasty ......And the new kitchens looking good .
Yess!!! Another great video, been waiting for so long 😝👌
i love tacos
I’m Mexican, and you nailed it! Wow!!
Im hungry and sleepy at the same time.
I'm surprised no one has said anything about that incredible DAMASCUS KNIFE. How I wish I had one.
Do you follow the 180 degree shutter speed rule on your videos?
Why do i feel so loved watching this om 😭
What a wonderful and delightful meal and the music 😋😍😍
I'm Mexican and this became my favorite food video ever, seriously.
zeeeeeeen
wwwwwwwwoooooooooow first time I whatch such a perfect taco recipe made by a foreigner: tortillas, salsa, cilantro and onion. Really beautiful execution, thank you very much. PS: I'm mexican :p
テンペ前にも出たことありますよね！

本当りょーやさん素敵過ぎです🌼
マサ って食材はじめて知った。シラントロのかわりにパクチー使ってみようかな。(^-^)/
Is being vegan in Japan difficult?
The comment section is full of love. Thank you and you all
Nice recipe,  but that tempeh reaaaally doesn't look like tempe.
I love your taco style🌱
Is he okay? He is usually quite calm in his videos, but now he seems to be somewhat accelerated and anxious
Awesome! <3
I missed you! don't stay away so long!
The music turned this into a cooking drama lol
The simple fact that you made handmade tortillas and used an old fashion tortilla press makes me so happy. I give you the utmost respect for creating your own version of Mexican food with a traditional touch <3 Thank you!
大豆テンペって………？(困惑)
as a mexican i aprove this video, is so aesthetic!
You are so talented.
This made me tear up. I’m new to this channel and WOW. Everything from his knife skills to the quality of the ingredients to the authenticity of the dish is absolute perfection. I love watching him prepare his ingredients and put in the time and devotion into his creations. Most channels just have people tossing ingredients from little bowls into bigger bowls, but this guy shows the process, and it means the world to me.
This helps me fall asleep 💚
この人すごい宗教的な感じがする。普通に信者の女引き連れてそうだし貢がせてそう。

Cut more onions, please. [10:45 - 10:55]
I see tempeh, I click
久々の動画、癒されました✨
Can masa be substituted with all purpose flour or wheat flour?
😍😍😍yess
ムギューって潰すやつ、やってみたいψ(｀∇´)ψ
Such a lovely moment in time.
Ehi! welcome back!)
Tempeh? I thought it's a caramel choco. Tempeh? You mean Tempe? Indonesian's Tempe? We love to eat tempe, 😅
Excellent, Beautiful!
What a beautiful cooking recipe. Has anyone tried this recipe? What do you think of its taste?
What are those magic fried beans?
ok, this is optional to answer, but is it okay to replace the onion with sweet onion as topping? and how did you know how to make all of these recipes?
黒いテンぺと白いテンぺ

I never thought to grill the ingredients in the oven for a salsa, since I don't have a "comal" I grill them in a pan
Please upload more videos! 😭

Why is one tempeh black
I love how I got an ad for a meat thermometer and then a sushi chef on this vegan cooking video
いつ見ても 美味しそうですね。
who knew you can 'veganize' tacos, good job!
Perfecto
Good recipe!! TANKS...but you do not have videos on your kitchen...you've finished building
Top!
how long did u grill them?
Yes my dosage
I am a french fan and I am delighted about your new posts. I'd like to know the brand of your toaster oven. All the best in your new home !!  I imagined that you couldn't get better and I was wrong, I suppose it is the japonese cultural miracle !
you’re so majestic
They seem so tasty😍

Te quedaron bien bonitas tus tortillas carnal  ; v , hasta te compraste tú maquinita para hacerlas :'v  ✨ 🌮
I am in love with everything here ....
I 🧡 tempeh
i missed u!
I love BGM and the color of this video.
When he took out the package with the flour and it had the corn I was like IS HE MAKING TORTILLAS!? And aww even he made salsa with actual chiles oooooh also, I heard somewhere that tortillas (like the ones he made) actually have a pretty strong smell but we've grown so accustomed to the smell of it that we don't perceive it anymore, is this true???
You have the approval of this Mexican. Very close to authentic tacos.
how does tempeh taste

Mirin that knife! :)
i hate the music
0:55 that was cool how he rolls the half onion to the side.
It looks like tempe from indonesia
How many cooking tools he had to wash....
Me: *feels bad for opening a box of fantastic foods taco filling and throwing it on a taco bell taco when i should be eating tempeh and homemade salsa*
Please, what is masa?
Looks delicious!
🌷
all thats missing is the michelada
とても面倒…
Nice!
I miss you
結局、ガスコンロでは撮影してないんですね。やっぱり難しいのかな

I’m a mexican and I can 100% confirm you got it right! Congratulations on those tortillas man 😔👌 looks delicious.
I just realized there’s no cheese in sight!
あの雷おこしみたいなのはなんだ....

Finally new video!
what's that stuff he put in there?
今回とは関係がありませんが、以前に種から撒いたハーブ達は使ったりはしないのでしょうか？
The secret of tacos is in the tortilla and sauce, and you sir did a perfect job making them, also adding onion, cilantro and lime juice make it even more autentic.  To be honest I was expecting a big failure but this Feels very Mexican and I can tell, just by looking, that the taste will be great...But is the firs time that I see a tempeh taco, looks delisious.
What brand is your knife?
what is the counter top gas burner that you use?
テンペ、さま、は 何味ですか、豆類ですか？

Ryoya sann, please cook mochiese agaiiinnn
Wonderful
delicious food too
:)
THAT TEMPE PART......... Indonesian fooooooooooooooooood
色鮮やかで美しい料理ですね。
食材を包丁で切る音がたまりません。
how would you eat that? fold it?...
You welcome
Might I suggest you substitute canned jackfruit (shredded and marinated) for the temph?
I love it
新しい動画来てたのわかんなかったあああああ(´；ω；`)ちょっと長めのレシピウレシイなぁ(*´ω｀)テンペってなんか煮凝りっぽいような・・・・？ｗマサとかいう新しい粉ｗ新居での生活はいかがですか？寒くなってきたので体調に気を付けてください(*´ω｀*)
4:49 My favorite food, tempeh. Always love it when cooked it with tumeric and fry it 😘💕 The black one, what is it?
Something seems off..
I am truly on the right side of Youtube.
Bad tacos 🤢
This vegan wants to eat that so bad.
i've a feeling we're not in Taco Bell anymore.
Great video! Thank you
plz upload more videos
Beautiful! What kind of oil do you use for deep frying?
155 mexicans didn´t like your tortillas
I’m watching this with one view 💜
Yum!
why is asian food always so spicy... my baby mouth can't handle this
まな板はどこでかいました？
Wow made your own tortillas. Impressive. They are quite simple to make but most people tend to use store bought.
I’m also Mexican and I really enjoyed watching your video, I loved when you made the tortillas on your prensa. Let me tell you that you made a good job. But don’t hesitate to eat someday real tacos on México 🇲🇽 👌🏻👍🏻
お部屋の動画また楽しみにしてまーす！
Who’s masa? Corn flour?
とても美味しそうですね。
Ryoyaさんの手にかかれば、どんな国の料理もヴィーガン対応に生まれ変わらせることができる気がします。
いつも驚きと尊敬の眼差しで楽しく拝見しています。
Haute tasty
陽の光の入り具合が格段に良くなった気がします！
ニューハウスの進捗状況が気になります！！
Jeans belt shirt. Sexy!
Awesome job as usual. I recently made Encheladas with homade flour tortillas and salsa verde from my garden. I used black beans and sweet potatoe as my filling. A good trick when making any tortilla is to use a bit of vegtable shortening in the dough. Cheers :)
how do you eat it tho....
Love your chopping board.
Where is the meet?
thanks! great to have you back!
りょうやさんの大麻に対しての意見を聞かせてください
What is a masa
Good video
But you seemed to be very frustrated as you were very fast or in hurry
What is masa?

Making some tortillas with a pinch of salt... A pinche sal...
Weird looking tempe haha
Where did you buy the tempeh? I live in Tokyo and haven't found anywhere other than National Azabu that may have vegan stuff.
wow
そのミニオーブンはどこのを使ってますか?
Why music? What happened here
Us Mexicans approve of this because you make nothing other than a taco. You don’t put your own twists or anything special, you just make a simple taco. LOVED the video
Good gods, a Damascened knife?
Yummy. Nice video!
Wait, is it coriander or is it cilantro..?

wtf you bought a press for the tortilla! o.o
包丁はなにを使っていますか？？
wow i'm surprised at how different tempe is in japan and in indonesia. Tempe in japan clearly use gigantic beans. we use smaller soy beans and use banana leave so the shape is smooth and not bulky. now i'm interested to taste tempe in japan, will it be different, i wonder :d
I really want to make this for my family but I’m a teenager and I don’t know where to get half of these items
i hope he find the wife to eat that tortilla with him
タコスをブランチくらいに食べるとすると、朝から仕込んで、粉こねて焼いてくれる人がいて、みたいな光源をつかったのか〜。そこまでのメッセージはないにしても、Peaceful cuisineを表現する動画だとおもいます。
Hi I’m in love with you
Hey peaceful cuisine! I love your videos! I was just wondering if you have a good knife brand recommendation. I’m currently living in japan and I want to take advantage of the great quality of knives here! ありがとうございます！
Where to buy the taco dough presser?
What is tempeh, anyone?
una pregunta, la ceba que utlitzes és  Ceba de Figueres???
Can someone please tell me what’s masa?
D IYはどうなったのですかね？
im Mexican
Te faltó que su pepino y su rábano. Los frijolitos de la olla y que su guacamolazo.
What is masa? I thought it was just plain flour
Yum. You’ve inspired me.
Where do u buy ur knife?
Very good!!!!! 😙😙😙
La Verdad Yo Prefiero Unos Tacos Al Pastor :p  🇲🇽
Ryoya, I realize you will probably never answer this but, how many shells will your masa recipe make? Is it just 5?
These tacos are better than a lot i've seen here on youtube, a vegan turn, but besides that pretty authentic tacos, i didn't expect you to make the tortillas by hand, as a mexican i really appreiate this video
Everything wr ONGs with that tacos. Hi from Mexico.
質問です。動画「What I Eat in a Day // Jan 2018 」で使ってる緑の蓋のガラス容器のメーカーを教えてください。洗いやすそうで、洗うのが苦手な母親に使わせたいのです。だいぶ探したのですが分からなかったので質問しました。よろしければ教えてください。

旧宅時代の青いハサミ、なくなった？
案外よかったですよ
あの、青いハサミ✂️
I can make a better dish, right doctor ras.
for sure needs bacon.
Except for the frying and use of endothelial inflammation causing oil it was interesting.
All homeboy has to do now is learn to flip the tortillas by hand and he could pass as a latino
A japanese vegan make better tacos than U.S tacos
This is a near perfect representation of how to make authentic Mexican tacos, I say near because there is usually meat but I understand this is vegan. Amazing job!
So good to see you back and cooking again! It's been too long since the last cooking video 😆 We missed you!
I'm Mexican and I love that this is made with like a normal tortilla not a "taco shell".
That looks so delicious! You have no idea how I appreciate the tortilla you made, almost every other person would have used a burrito-like tortilla and while it's ok it's still not the same, the flavour is very different. And yours inflated while being cooked, THAT is the sign of a good tortilla. As my grandma would say: "your tortillas inflate? Good! NOW you can marry."

Also, a suggestion. You can try cooking the salsa in a small pot until it changes its colour, that gives it a different flavour so you can give it a small twist if you want. 

Thanks for the video! Much love from Mexico.
The salsa, the tortilla bubbling on the comal, the green lemon, the tortilladora ...

As a Mexican fan, Im really proud of your research! This was fantastic! 👏🏻🔥
As a Mexican I aprove that taco, good job 💪🏽😊🤤
I really love the filter you put on all of your videos, really gives me the peaceful vibe!  Thank you so much for this yummy recipe!! 😊
Very accurate!!! I was pleased to see him make the tortilla from scratch PERFECTLY. He made the salsa exactly how it is made here just wow thank you💚
You made a video, how I have missed your work peacefull cuisine.
the salt he uses comes from my tiny hometown in france
OMG, If the tortilla had been inflated more, as we say in Mexico, you already can get married ♡... Just saying 😄
As a Mexican I can tell this is pretty authentic.
Mexican here, not gonna lie I got super happy seeing him make the tortillas by hand and having an actual tortilla press. Super dope
Todos los mexicanos aprobando su taco 😍
who would dislike this?! It's just a guy making tacos
Just finished the same video with music and switched here. His hands are so beautiful.
Finally some good content on YouTube
Edit: i wanted to mention the existence of this bean-cube.
Such a peaceful asmr♥
It will be nice to see what's coming next..like how you serve them and eat them:-)
Now my mind has calmed down and i can go to sleep............
I’m so proud of yours tortillas haha looks amazing!! 
Greetings from México 🇲🇽👌🏼
You are back yaaay, i miss you so much <3
Now, I'm hungry.  I loved your interpretation of the taco.  I live near Santa Fe, so I'm used to the way they are cooked here.  Thank you for posting a vegan option.  I would love to see a video on why you eat vegan and a normal day of vegan food.  I am trying to eat vegan and am having a hard time being satisfied.  Nice to see you back.  👍
Thanks for this!
As a sub from Mexico this taco is approved. DUDE, the salsa.. the tortillas..even the onion with the cilantro. 

I'm very happy 😊

P.s. Sighed softly when you used the machine for the tortillas. I've watched people using it incorrectly and it made me cringe but you used very well.. haha. Good!
at 10:16 i just hear myself say, out loud, "oh my god that knife is a work of art
FINALLY SOME GOOD QUALITY CONTENT I HAVE MISSED YOU!! DAMN I NEEDED THIS , I AM HAVING AN EXAM .
My finger hurts from clicking on the video so aggressively
I really really love your beautiful No Music Videos it's really peaceful and I'd love to try your recipes, thank you for doing this. Greetings from the other side of the world 😂 from Colombia 🇨🇴🇨🇴💜
Nomamen me dio hambre.
As you were making the maza, I could smell it with my imagination hah. My mom and I love making fresh tortillas and the smell is pure nostalgia for me. We tap and flip the tortilla with our hands while it’s on the hot comal so it was cute to see you use a tool but it’s all good 😉This recipe is Mexican approved. I love that you didn’t use “taco” shells hahaha
I usually sleep through these videos soo relaxing .
You need to make a new video on making chai tea from scratch!!!!!
Being Mexican myself, I am amazed that you actually did some homemade tortillas with an actual tortilla press!Ashamed to say I am too lazy to make them myself, instead I purchase store made tortillas😫

— Great video!
Thank you so much for your videos!! I Love all of them! I’m a huge fan🤓
0:00 
walks in 
Me: who's ready for some tacos?!

Tomatos: 
FINALLYYYYY
I was waiting for your videos
I absolutely love the peaceful videos 💜💜💜
Es correcto, desde mi punto de vista ganaste muchos puntos con tu tortilla hecha a mano en el comal.
Muy buen trabajo con el cilantro y la cebolla.
De México con amor.
I love the practical spin you gave to making tacos. You even got a tortilladora! As a mexican I salute your good work sir.
久々に見られる嬉しさです
Hi, what is the difference between the light and dark tempeh? Is it just a different texture or also taste?
We indonesian hate lOVE tempe
Oishii! I will try this recipe. I love both with music and without music 💛
FINALLY! THE REAL TACOS ARE HERE! 
As a Mexican, I'm truly happy seeing this. Thank you so much for your effort.
dang. I've missed your cooking videos! Welcome back!
Peaceful Cuisine: How to make tacos 

Taco Bell:








what is this disgrace
I'll try tempeh tacos... You must try vegan baja tacos (with cauliflower or champignon mushrooms) i think you gonna love them ;)
I'm very ...impressed! lol your handmade tortillas look better than mine. I appreciate how authentic you made your tacos.
As mexican i aprove your taco wey! ;D 
And that salsa 10/10
Moments like this are why im glad notifications for you are on but also sad i needed sleep and missed it!
Oh finally you post a new video. I am so excited. Miss you so much
I was literally thinking about your channel yesterday and you uploaded 😂 I missed your videos ❤️
I appreciate the way you use tempe as the protein substitute, and love the way you fry that tempe, absolute perfection 👌👌
6 min in and im half asleep... I love your channel, I find it relaxing and the food looks amazing.
I don’t really know what tempeh is but watching him cut it is oddly satisfying
Not only are these videos absolutely incredible, but they’re also some of the best ASMR
Looks delicious and so relaxing to watch! Found your channel from watching Michael the vegan activist 🌱

Tempeh aka Tempe from my Country, Indonesia. awww ❤❤❤❤😍😍😍
So nice to see you again. I missed your wonderful hands making great meals. 
Your vegan version of Mexican 🌮 is perfect for people like me, who cannot eat meat.
Thanks to be here again. 
Greetings from Mexico !
I was seriously craving tacos the other day and I was too far from my favorite vegan spot that sells amazing Vegan "fish" tacos, but seeing how simple it is to make vegan tacos, I'm going to try my hand at this one. Thank you!
Old kitchen was more smooth and lively
I discovered I need garlic peeling asmr 😂
amazing sounds
literally peaceful
Kinda make me proud of how you make your own version of my favorite meal, in Mexico there's a lot of vegan too
Thank you so much for uploading !!!!!
Wishing you all the happiness in the world !!!💟
no cierra eso flaco, pone el video comiendo, vas a ver que no podes ! saludois desde guatemala
congrats on  MANAGING TO MAKE A PERFEEECCCTTT TORTILLA!!!! muy bien.
Tacos.... I love tacos😍. I make mine with king oyster mushrooms. Never tried making them with tempeh. I'll try it next time. Nice seeing you cook again.😁
I am Mexican. And seeing you make this dish was so awesome!! Great job... you gave it your own style and that is so cool!
You and your cooking have been missed! Thank you for sharing.
yummy
Could you make some autumn/christmas themed videos? I need inspiration for christmas dinner
lots of love
Beautiful interpretation of this mexican food. Congrats.
Hello Peaceful Cuisine I am a new Subscriber
greetings from Indonesia
For vegan tacos, you should try Hibiscus flower tacos with pickled red onions and guacamole!
Mexican aproved.
And here I am, born and raised in the country where tempe comes from...never saw a black tempe ever in my life 🤣 
Nice knowing that tempe could go to another level 👍🏼
And nice video editing as always 😊
Your videos are so calming! Loved it!
You are amazing!!! 
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰 ❤️
Ive missed you! 🤧
🇲🇽 tacos 👌👌🍴
I don't have ASMR . I just find your videos oddly satisfying without the music component.
You are so dedicated,.humble,.conscientious and passionate about what you do.
It is a joy to behold.
Thank you for sharing yourself here, with all of us! 💜💜💜💜
Better to watch with headphones. 🎧😌
Hmmm..so yummy.. Ryoya.. simple cooking but looks delicious, 👍😊, thanks for sharing...
Great to see you making another splendid video.
so peaceful, I am getting sleepy now 💞
I'm a simple mexican. I see  tacos I click.
Love the videos you make so so much! Everything you make looks so delicious and the videos are always so well thought of. Amazing work every time!
Can someone explain to me what is masa? I suppose it's corn flower but I'm not sure 
And also i looove your videos
Just what I needed after a stressful week!
Shoutout to tempeh. ... And Ryo who used it on this recipe, LOL.
try marinating the tempeh in turmeric and a bit of salt before frying it! it’s heavenly
Please make your cookbook in English too, I'm a big fan of your videos and love the recipes 😊
I'm literally sitting here with hot chocolate and chocolate chip cookies as I watch all his healthy food videos
That tempeh you used truly is a good quality thoug
Tempeh is food from my country guys! Indonesiaa ♡♡
missed these kind of videos from you. so peaceful, I feel extra relaxed now :)
and a bit hungry, too.
Flour + Salt (a pinch) + Water = Sand





👍🏻
I've never felt so happy to see such an amazing representation of Mexican food!
As a Mexican- IM SO HAPPY YOU MADE THIS OMG!! ILL DEFINITELY TRY THE SAME~! <3
im an indonesian and im surprised that you used Tempeh🤗
lol, it´s like a new type of taco, very good technique making those tacos tbh
Just subscribed
Is that the balinese wristband?
#cmiiw
Amazing! No idea what some of the ingredients are, and that's so intriguing. Glad to see new videos coming out.
This looks amazing! Your food and videos are works of art
the sound is really comforting........
As Indonesian, I proud of tempeh although yours are really different with local tempeh in Indonesia!
Those tacos look gooodddd! 😋😋
So relaxing to watch! Looks tasty as well!
that's tempeh from my country 😁
Low key asmr
Wi ireng² tempe opo jal?😌😂😂
10:15 that's one funky knife, sir, I love it
I enjoy the ones with no music best. Hearing the sounds of the kitchen is so relaxing.
Welcome back, Takashima-san!
Missed your videos, my friend! 👌🏼✨
I'm mexican and I'M SO PROUD that you made your own tortillas 💖
so peaceful.
best bed time video i've ever seen
I really love this no music one. ASMR to my ear.
I’m not even vegan but this looks really good
Thanks for this! Beautiful looking tempeh. Have to search for one like that in the States. Best to u ~
New kitchen, old tacos delicious! Thanks for back!👏👏👏👏
Wow Ryoya every video you make impresses me and this one even more. I appreciate the fact that you made  tortilla from scratch you even have the "tortilladora" .  Amazing effort put into this dish 👏👏
Thank you!!! We miss you and we miss so much your recipes! Yo are so talented! Please come back soon 😸
I thought I would only see fried tempe in my home! Awesome video as always!
finally new cooking vid
I think his a vegan?.
Omg it's so nice to see a real taco and not taco bell , muy  bueno 😋
would love to be your neighbor <3<3<3<3<3
The tempeh is little bit different than the original tempeh
I love it how his appliances are all compact 😂😂
This is fantastic as always, but the echo still bothers me. It makes a lot of the louder sounds amplified :/
10:16 Can we take a moment to marvel at that fabulous creation
OMG THat looks SOOOO good! But how do you get the tempeh to not taste chalky?
Huh. I never tried ginger on tempe before. Probably would've grilled it, though, and add LOTS of shallot. :9
I love how the tomatoes squirted when you grabbed them.
Como mexicana me gusta ver estos vídeos, me hacen sentir especial... Más que nada porque es difícil replicar nuestra comida fuera de nuestro país 😁 <3
Welcome back! Missed your lovely videos!
Looks great👍even I am not vegan. To get more juice from the lime, you have to cut in wedges and then squeeze 😊
Wow nice Damascus knife. I just got one from Tokyo last week when I was there on holiday! Great video as always!
Sensational video. Missed you
Tacos pake tempe? Baru tau kalo itu makanan mahal 😅
Once you cook the tortillas you need to lightly fry them in oil 1-2 seconds to make them pliable
Using tampe.. it's creative
I love this channel because it's relaxing
A tus tacos les falta conociste cía, un treh
ASMR
Viva PEACEFUL CUISINE Cabrones!
What are the types of knives you use they look amazing ~
Not bad, i'm mexican and those tacos look great.
Yay your back I really love your recipes
This guy uses many tools that I've never even considered...
Thanks for making videos without music. I understand you like it with music but most viewers don't.
That has to taste dynamite🤯🤩😋😤
テンペって何だろうって思って調べた大豆の発酵食品なのね
おいしそう
Where's the carnitas dude, or the dog trying to eat the food while you prepare it. You must eat it on the go and be able to do it with one hand and under 3 minutes.
Also, ¿dónde fregados está doña pelos?
Grettings from Mexico!
You could be a really good taquero here in México!
As I was watching you touching the tortilla with a spatula and I just kept thinking "JUST FLIP IT OVER WITH YOUR HAND!!" 😂
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR U
okay but how are you going to fold them
Looove these videos. But what I think is missing is a shot where ryoya  tastes the final product! That would be so satisfying after all his hard work!
0:54 I HAVE TO MAKE SURE NO ONE MISSES THAT SMOOTH TRANSITION
Yessssss!! I have missed you
wow tempe??? Everyday i eat it, it is so delicious😂
This man made his own damn tortillas.... I love him
Tempe! Btw nice vids
its like asmr cooking .
I missed ut new video🎥 maybe other urans also isn't it? thank u come back bro 👍
Id rather listen to you make the food than listen to music
I think the music is uneccessary
I'VE MISSED YOU
J'adore ! Très sophistiqué et joli à la fois  ...
It is the coolest asmr I have ever heard😍😍😍
thank you for offering this video with and without music. It's so relaxing to watch you create in silence again. creativity has it's own beautiful music. AND now i want tacos. though i am making cannellini bean soup with dandelion greens mmmmmmm
Welcome back! again you prepare food with care without skimping on time or ingredients, the quality really shows. Somehow I have never been attracted to Mexican cuisine but these tortillas looks so good, it makes me want to try them out. Here in the UK I can't find 100% corn tortillas in supermarkets.
baru tau ada tempe item :O
In my state it's said that if the tortilla puffs up while cooking, you're gonna get proposed to soon. Please invite us all to the wedding.
Im hungry now, they look delicious,  regards from Mexico  🇲🇽 ✌️
I never considered tempeh tacos, interesting choice
What kind of tempe is that? It looks like not fermented well, or it just another variety in Japan? Still, enjoyed your video 👍
やったー！！！待ってました♡♡♡
Tempe from Indonesia ❤❤❤
Its been to long, old friend.
I'm a proud Mexican. Seriously, if the taste is right you could live off tacos
Soy sauce in a taco
YOU USED TEMPE 😍😍🇮🇩
Scrolling through the comments, I'm surprised how many people are surprised he knows how to make authentic tacos. My husband and I do from-scratch tacos, rice, and beans a couple times every month. I took for granted that people at least knew how or had a press. 

As far as your recipe, looks delicious. I would only say saute the garnishing onions for a minute to kick down their raw flavor. It doesn't dilute their flavor, just makes them less acute.

Also, if you want thicker, more complex salsa, put it on the pot with some chicken stock for about an hour or 2 👍🏻
lmao i was tearing up when he was cutting the onion
Me making a taco: goes to taco bell 
gets 10000 tacos
Taco-desu!!!  Thank you for this amazing video, Senpai!  You have found yourself a new subscriber. Will definitely support this channel. Keep up the amazing work! #BetterThanASMR
I was so happy to wake up to this!  ❤️❤️❤️
5:14 にんにくじゃない？笑笑
you gotta put a little flour into the masa mix as well, it’s a small difference in taste but a better one
All looks good except for the stuffing... maybe a greasy chicharrón. 9.5/10
Finally! Also that's the first time I've ever seen a black tempeh
So inspired by the care you put into everything.
It is wonderful to see the art of your cooking, especially using non meat ingredients. Come to Indonesia and you'll taste the real tempeh and other traditional vegetarian foods here :)
Way more authentic than the Tacos I make! Btw, what's masa? Is it just cornflour?
Why did u cut the onion lik tht😭
Sugoi! Man i wanna eat that! You really are a good cook! And it even makes me hungry
I love your taco style!
Whole bean Tempe? Really??? O.x hmm.
OMG ITS BEEN FOREVERRRR
You learn quite well the art of making tortillas!!
those tempes look somewhat different from what I have daily
As a mexican this makes me really happy! The fact that you prepared the tortillas and they inflated is a MUST for a good taco. Love your videos
すごい美味しいそう！
I’m Mexican and I would like prepare this recipe, looks really interesting this way to make tacos :0
I’ve never seen black tempeh before. This video made me crave tacos.
Olive oil. this is the secret
There's not enough salsa on those tacos!
i missed your videos! <3
You are so talented ! I need to go to Kyoto once you open up a restaurant .
YAAAAASSS YOU ARE BACK
I still feel like ginger and soy sauce in a taco is blasphemy, but I would still be willing to try making this recipe. It looks very tasty
How many of Jun's cats are here cheating on him?
dude- i put a raw garlic in my mouth and chewed it
my new asmr 👌👌👌
make a marshmallow recipe, i dare you
In Mexican culture (I'm Mexican BTW) if your tortilla inflates that means that you're ready to get married, which is like good luck 9:50
Secretly an ASMR channel
I think this is the first recipe that I actually will try!!
This is what I call food porn, no music just natural sounds. Just love it
Yeeeeyyyy tempe !!!
My favorite
Tacos🌮 tacos🌮 tacos -^- 💕💖🌮
Miss you 😘
Just flip it w ur hand
The best tempeh, is indonesian tempeh
le faltó la carne asada xdxd
These asmr videos bring me life
I’ve never seen black tempeh before! How interesting.
Tempe!❤
3.18 see the tridatu bracelet
I was just watching this Channel on making samosas with mint sauce and this is such a relief with no music and chatter.  It is very refreshing and very nice camera and sound technique.  Extremely refreshing genre of artistic demonstration.  Keep up the great work!
He’s BACK😍
That’s the coolest tortilla press I’ve seen in my life.
Omg even those tempe looks so cute! 😍
wasn't aware that they also sell tempeh in japan lol
That knife is beautiful!
Oh snap! Tacos?!?! How did I miss this?!?
Nice try xD
Me encantó esta receta, viva México señores
とってもヘルシーなタコスですね🌮
パクチーが入っているのでちょっとタイ風な感じですか？？
Those tacos were lovely, if you want use de tortilla press again you can prepare “quesadillas” is like a taco but it incluid grated cheese inside, you can add sauce, beans and “pico de gallo” (normally with tomato, coriander, onion (and nopal, avocado or pepper like an personal extra))
HE'S BACK YASSS
tempe goreng sama sambel tomat
Do u take b12
Splendide !!!
Are you really vegan?
But you didn't remove the seeds? that must have been so hot
tempe from Indonesia yiyy
💛💛💛
Ugh i miss your videos so much!
Tortilla 9/10
Salsa 9/10
Cebolla y cilantro 10/10
Frijoles 3/10 :,b
I've never been this early on his video
oh!!! yay, you're back :-) :-)
The real asmr
Pakee tempeee
needs crema or a cheese. otherwise, wonderful! glad that you made homemade tortillas and didn’t stick to store bought.
Ryoya is GOD
yesssss
Beautiful plates....and beautiful knife ...where you buy ???
Love the homemade tortillas and sauce! Looks delicious!
Is it okay to blend something is hot with the electrical blender?? Cause I heard that this could be really dangerous.. 🧐

However, this looks so delicious 🤤    (Comment from Kor🇰🇷
You're an artist <3
I absolutely loved the video! I love how is that the tortillas are actually how we eat them in Mexico and well latinoamerica, loved the video! And do you mind if I ask you what kind of knives you use? I have being looking for a new set of knives since I’m a chef and yours seem quite intriguing to me.
NOW YOU CAN MARRY MIJOOO
Yaasssss, I missed your videos!! 😫👏🏻👏🏻
Beautiful and authentic
¡Tortillitas echas a mano! That salsa looks very authentic. I like to stuff tacos with jackfruit carnitas. ¡Right on, great video! 👍
I want to see you in the next video too! like you used to do :D
シシトウトマト玉ねぎ
…夏に撮影したんですか？
この時期にアップされてもどれもスーパーじゃ高めの物ばかりなので…夏にアップして欲しかったです。
Adding water, peeling the skin from the tomato and chili, as well as adding a tad of salt to the salsa before blending it can give you an authentic Mexican salsa.
Super relaxing
I missed this guy!
dude I think there’s an enderman in your house 6:20
A vegan taco? No thanks.
Tempeh?
sedapnya tempe goreng.......
What are  masa ans tempeh?
As a Mexican, I approve of your taco-making skills! I just wonder if your salsa turned out a bit too spicy, my american sister can usually handle half a jalapeño only (sad, but she is a gringa after all). I've tried many vegan tacos in here before, usually they make soy-based meat or gluten/wheat-meat. The later are my favorite! I've also seen roasted jamaica-flower tacos, you'd usually use the jamaica after having boiled it to make jamaica water. Excellent recipes, as always! :D
Mexican Food ! I love it.
Mmmmm thats look good, i love this Chanel
How to say i love u with no music
Excellent!  Even without music your videos are mesmerizing... talented and humble.. You're absolutely fascinating! #respect
Nice!!
wow, this is the weirdest taco i ever seen, nice tortilla btw
I really like this!
tempe hahahah actually in my country we usually eat fried tempe with rice and sambal! yummy
海外旅行でも行かれてたんですか？
No avocados?!?!?! WHAT IS THIS????
I like that you made your own tortillas!
I love you.
I love the filter, makes me think of childhood summers
As a mexican I cant tell that you dide a great job and the tortillas looked awesome as well as the salsa! Those tacos are bomba ajua
Okairi 😁😁😁
Tempe & oncom 😁
I'm Indian can someone tell me what tempeh is?
I can smell this video
Anyone kind enough to give me an explanation on what is tempeh.. Im still wondering what it is 😭
I am surprised Japan have Tempeh, its indonesian ingredients o.o
What oil do you use to deep-fry? Thank you for the awesome videos!
1st
Love what u doing
Really love those beautiful knifes of yours. And the video as a whole!
I think that he’s vegan :3
I love your videos and as a Mexican, I totally approve and love your beautiful and perfect tacos!!! Excellent salsa, perfect tortillas! Love it all x
As a mexican I find funny and cute how you’re so delicate haha we actually turn the tortilla with our bare hands and roast the tomatoes in a comal 
Your tacos still look tasty tho
😍
10:25  😍 cool knife
what type of oil would you fry in?
What can we put instead of tempeh?
Wow I love tempeh
Is that Indonesian tempe?
🖤
🤗💗
this is epic quality, what knives are you using??
yo those look good
Thank god no taco shells were used.
Looooveee your videos.
What is tempeh?
really i like all your videos so much
GREAT JOB, GUY!!!!
Limpiaste las weas?
Beautiful.
0:54 how did he do that
what. is. tempeh.
Good video
Glad to see your cooking since last video😍😍

By the way, what kind tempeh is that? It's first time i've seen it
Tacos chingones
包丁が美しいですね
Is that tri datu bracelet?
11:00 that was one sexy knife!
As a mexican I think that tortilla is beautiful, and also the taco, but the tortilla was like art
yay food videos are back!
no
I love everything about this channel. But please export the video at its true aspect ratio instead of adding black bars! It doesn't take up my whole screen! Otherwise, perfect video 😊
as a mexican i was soooo incredibly giddy when you started making the tortillas <3
Proper corn tortilla press.
Looks great! HISPANIC WARMTH with a touch of JAPANESE GRACE!  Awesome!
with all respect but, now I know how does it feel for japanese when another culture tries to make sushi...I mean, he has the idea...but those are not tacos...
Mexikan kitchen is really delicious, and you do too. Today let's try Taco !
いつもきれいで美味しそうな動画ありがとうございます。
同じようなフラットブレッドでチャパティ作ってみていただけないですか？
インドの人がやるようにプーっとうまく膨らまなくて悩んでいます…
some things I noticed here are:
1. as an Indonesian, the tempeh(s) look weird to me. I mean that's not what tempeh usually looks like here
2. you're wearing the three-colored braided thread bracelet that is commonly wore by Balinese, never knew that it's also common in Japan

but it's great video, hope you upload videos more often 👌🏼
🤩🤩
Meat ??
I must have that press
How do you close it???
You are not just a cook but an artist too!!  Hypnotizing video as always. But i missed the special color filter you used to use in your no music videos, hope you will use it next time.
the tempe tho... here in indonesia tempe is more.... hmm idk how to say it, dense?
So the onion and coriander are raw when placing on the taco? I would have maybe put the final product in the oven for a few minutes just get warm and let the flavours melt through a bit!
did anyone else die when the oven went off
Wtfk
Tanto pedo por unos tacos de frijoles jajaja
THAT KNIFE>>>>>>>>
This is your first cooking video in your new apartement right?, you're video is getting better. Love it ryoya
My grandmother says that if your tortilla is inflated it means that soon you will get married hahaha
I’m Latina and you just taught me how to make real tacos, I’m forever grateful
The bracelet, I believe you got that from Bali!!
This guy has been living in 2025 and youtube didn't tell.
i can die in peace now
Cool
Asmr
I'm pleasently surprised that his vegan water doesn't come in yet another small plastic bag.
What is masa? It's an specific type of flour? Is there I way I can make a home made ?
Now THOSE are some tacos I’d die for! 30 bucks easy.
I thought I was going to laugh at you, just trying to make those tortillas.. I really expected you to fail ....... but you didn't!  Tu no eres pendejo, casate conmigo guey! Quiero tacos 4 evr.
Yay!!! A new video!!
That tempeh fascinated me! It looks so natural, and I want to get my hands on some
Please try making Pani puris indian style
Now do a bandeja paisa
As a Mexican I approve it but I miss the meat
MAKING TACO WITH TEMPEH LOLOLOL, mexican mixed with indonesian.
Now I’m officially starving...
As a Mexican I approve the hand made tortillas.
when they handled the chilies with bare hands i cringed lol
is this mexican or indonesian food? 😅
I AM really proud of you, you totally nailed it! I'm mexican, by the way. Muchas 3 year old boy love watching your videos.
So... how much is the tempeh in japan?
Look tasty !❤️🎈
久しぶりにちゃんとお料理がしたくなりました＾＾（マサ…テンペ…何処に売ってるのかな…)
no meat?? yeah no thanks.
いつもステキな動画をありがとうございます😊
パクチーでもシャンツァイでもコリアンダーでもないシラントロという呼び方、初めて知りました😃
Where's the beef?
the ugliest tempe i ever seen
Why is the tortilla inflating thing important?
Hey those aren't New Mexican chilis...  they look more like Asian chilis.
tempeh ?
What kind of knife is that, does anyone know? The one used at 10:16.
Still feel like it’s not as peaceful as it was ...
😅👌🏻💖🇲🇽💖😘💕
前から思ってたけど、使われてるボウルとか鍋？が好き。底に模様があるやつ。
なんのメーカーなんだろう？何かの動画で紹介とかしてるのかな？料理動画しか見ないからわからん（> <）
You’re becoming lazy bro
It's not a taco – but I don't care. You've done so well!!!! Good job!!
What kind of taco is this? Please specify in title before posting.
3:55 sorry but that looked and sounded like diarrhoea.
Oh honey, i dont think thats even close to texmex
Deep fried tempe/tofu is hardly healthy
ew why is the filter so brown remove the video filter please
This channel was doing ASMR years before it was a thing
you can film yourself pouring a bowl of cereal and I'd watch.
NO MUSIC VERSION IS BETTER FIGHT ME
Good God, i thought you’re never going to upload anything during your kitchen set up, but man, what a treat!
after super long you are back! this is beautiful as always..
this man is using black rice while wearing a white shirt
he isn't afraid
Am I the only one that found this video specifically to be very aggressive lol
This dude seems like he’s not having a good day
THE KING IS BACK!... It felt a little rushed, though. You can slow down, Ryoya! We love your work at whatever pace you like best.
idk why but this vid felt more rushed than usual
Yes !
I missed those videos <3
You seem particularly aggravated; I could tell immediately, and others can, too.  It's the ones demanding content, isn't it?  Please just ignore them; if you don't feel your environment is ready, the reasonable of us are willing to wait.

I did not say it's a bad video; it absolutely isn't.  It's just that, after seeing so many of your other videos, I can see anger in the movements, and it concerns me.
In malaysia it called as "bubur pulut hitam".  Its yummy😻 i will call my mom to cook it for me....thank you for sharing.
久しぶりにお菓子（？）見れて嬉しいです！日本の方のコメント見つけられないくらい海外の方ばっかで驚いちゃいましたw
Hay. Try drying the room up a little to take the edge off of the sound by putting up some panels that absorb sound along the walls and anywhere two flat surfaces meet. (A.k.a, along the edges and in the corners of the room not covered by appliances and furniture.) You can get creative with it and print murals or other artwork on them if you want. As it is, the sound is echoing and being amplified by the room. It's coming through in the recording.

Regardless, I'm glad you are back.
That's some good twisted arroz con leche, loved it!
I will somehow download all of these ASMR videos
fight me
Finally!! Waited for so long  🙏😝💞
We name this dish Bubur Ketan Hitam in Indonesia and it's usually served in special occasion :D
Anyway I always love your vids ❤️❤️❤️

No music videos are the best ones.
Gasp he switched from using metric to imperial 😱
All jokes aside, really missed watching your videos! Welcome back ^^
You're back!!! I missed you and your brilliant videos yay
Always love the no music one
Just by watching it makes me feel internal peace
thanks for watching

Seriously, I can't get enough of these videos.

Finally! Missed you 😊
I've been waiting. Thank you! Btw this is my favourite, but I've never tried it with fruits. Will probably try it later on
This is what I liked about this channel:
1. It's vegan since I'm a vegan.
2. Its ASMR is not cringy than any kind of other ASMR channel, in fact it's sound lot more peaceful and cooler than others.
3. Look delicious :)
Thanks so much for the upload! I LOVE your no music cooking videos 💕
Everyone's therapy is back! Thanks for the upload Mr. Ryoya! With all love, your viewers! 💕😍🤗
This is aesthetically pleasing to watch lol. Its calming too, all the sounds and what not. I love this channel lol
Wow first time I'm early to one of your videos. Glad to see a new one. Can't wait to see the new kitchen in completion! Thanks for this upload.
In Indonesia, we call it "Bubur Ketan Hitam". Such a great content!
美味しそう(*´-`)

オシャレでいい浄水器でも付けられるといいですねぇ～(*´-`)
Ah, the beauty of real sounds.
1:40 Wow that was an oldddddd school can opener. I love it. Another great, relaxing video and I agree with others' sentiments that you were doing ASMR before it was the trendy thing. Can't wait to see what comes next!
I've seen some comments saying they felt this was rushed, but I disagree. I loved the video and the recipe. Will try it for sure. Thank you for a peaceful few minutes ;)
I've missed your videos!! They are always so calming to watch😊😊
Yay you uploaded one without music! The quiet cooking sounds are so soothing, thank you! 😁
Why did that sound like Mac and cheese? I’m confused 😂
Very random request but I prefer your recipes in grams rather than cups 😂 I find grams to be more precise
ASMR Cooking tutorials. Welcome to the internet.
yessaas finally!!
This is the only channel from which I really crave for more content... Brilliant video, as always <3
yay!!! so happy you're posting cooking videos again!!
bracelet from Bali, Indonesia 👏👏
So Happy you are back. I've heard of sweet black rice but I have never tried it. Now I have a good reason. Thanks
Love this rice. Higher antioxidants than wild blueberries. Will try this tommorrow. Often make a similar thing but with stevia and goji berries. Best comfort food!!!
Whatever you do is just peaceful and organized. Glad your cooking for us again!
Tasty 🤗 Thanks for being back!
🍉🌵🌶
takashima-saaaaan, i missed your videos! so good to see you back 😭💖
Welcome back!!! You have been missed :)
Oh my god it's literally pulut hitam HAHAHA
i just realized. that's called bubur ketan hitam in my country😂
This is absolutely gorgeous Thai dessert!!
Congratulations on your new kitchen! And as always great video although I think you need set the camera a little further to get a wider a angle. Love the white dress shirt with the background and the white measuring cup combination. Keep it up 💪.
can we use brown/cane sugar instead of palm sugar?
パッと見おしるこに見えた
黒米をデザートにって発想なかったから食べてみたいな
I miss you, im so sorry i havent watched any of your videos lately. 😭
おかえりなさい❣❣
Greetings; just received your book.  So excited to use for your future cooking.  Looks beautiful!  Thank you very much!
amazing! keep up the good work :)
Finallyy youre backkk!!!! Thank God
前の家に比べてコンクリ打ちっぱなしだからなのか音が響きますね！
soooo goooood to have your ASMR cooking video back.
This is the best way to calm me; I’m a hypochondriac and I love you. <3.
Thanks for the no-music video :)
I just literally said "I miss Peaceful Cuisine TT-TT" a few minutes ago~
Where art thou? 
Upload to satiate my soul please💖
I’m not a vegan but I’d love to try making all of yours recipe.
Still guessing what advantage is in measuring by volume. I guess I'll never guess.
This guy vs Jun’s kitchen — WHO WILL WIN?
It's called "bubur ketan hitam" in Indonesia, we have made it for a loooong time ago, empirically traditional recipe
so good, glad to see you back 🙏🏻💗
Saw your video notification ... and my eyes said to my mind ... today we are going to watching something beautiful and satisfactory.
Saw Ryoya's reflection at 2:56 (grumpy look) made me laugh for a while xD Happy for a new video in your new house!
Bring it to a low boil or high boil?
These are the best kind of ASMR videos! I prefer these videos over people whispering into mics and taping on random things
Have never heard of black rice.
looks great.
Still wearing Tridatu from Bali...
Perfect ❤❤❤
カップ使って計ってるの珍しい！
お部屋が変わって響く音が倉庫っぽいですね
また新鮮で良い感じです
Beuatiful... Perfect... Excellent...
Very Very Good! 
Success, Always! Hugs, from Brazil ...   #dgtudo
At 3:38 all millennials know the vine
The last two small pieces of mango you left behind bothered me more than reasonably
I believe that he is kiwami japan... Or secretly working with or for him.
そのタイマー初めて見ました！新鮮でいいですね😌
最近はりょうやさんの料理動画で寝落ちしてます笑
Your videos always sexy! Asmr for lyfeeee
Learn how to make rice drink?
Beautiful!   Missed these videos, I love them.
In indonesia the name is bubur ketan item but without fruit,  black rice with coconut milk..
Finally you’re back with a new video so glad
In indonesia, we called it,. Bubur ketan itam wkwkkw
What is the taste of black rice and how does it differ from normal white rice ??
待ってましたっ！
he is back!! I suppose you are all settled in your new place now :) new videos from Ryoya always make my day
most beautiful mango I've ever seen!!
Ryoya, you’re back!!♥️♥️ so glad!! x
3:40 "That's what good pu**y sounds like." 😂
おいしそう....食べてみたい...

あ、新しいキッチン　あまりに自然で違和感なくて感想忘れた！
Is there an advantage to adding the sugar after cooking? Curious :-O
Here, in Indonesia, we sually use jackfruit not manggo
Amazing! The camera knows what you are about to do. Haha! Composition is top notch!
Looks delicious! Do you think I can use brown sugar instead of palm sugar? Or maybe cane sugar? Thanks for the video!
Yay!!!!!! I'm so happy your videos are back!!
Thank GOD you’re back!!! I love watching these videos before I go to sleep. They’re so calming and peaceful. Reminds me of my childhood when my mom used to wake up early in the morning to make food and I could hear her from my bedroom. Thankyou ♥️
In Indonesia we, call it bubur ketan
黒米？
私はインドネシアでそれを見つけることができません
主に白米と玄米のみ 😊😂
Yay! Your back! More videos pls. :-)
Missed youuuu  so so much 💞 Wb 😘
Acoustics are a bit too echoey but great video!
The only one ASMR I love <3
So happy to see you back! 💕
YOU'RE BACK OMG SKSMD
Yes!! You're back!!!
Tnks for the no music. Love them <3
I’m your Thai fan and we have this kind of dessert too. It’s my favorite one. You made it looks so delicious 😋 and I’m so happy for your comeback.
Welcome back! We love you <3
Arroz doce...
I don't know why but I was kinda excited to see the new setup lol.
Keep making these kind of vids
The visuals in this are so artistic. does he have marshmallow recipes?
This looks so good, great job!
This looks delicious - i think i will make it as a dessert this weekend for my family thank you!!
Yall... his photography is crazy!!! You can see it at ryoyatakashima.com. Why have I not seen it earlier jeez.
You should try using celtic sea salt if you can acquire it in your country. It really adds some great flavor to food.
In love with your content💜💜💜
I think this setup would be really improved with something to control the echo. In your old kitchen the sound was very crisp.
Asmr but making food
Finally you're back!!
Lol that's my night snack today. I love when it's not to sticky, combined with a soft bread and coconut milk 😋
Black Rice.. Pudding???
since when do you start measuring your ingredients lol
How I missed these videos. Thank you
I've missed these so much!!
ayyyy he's back! I'm so happy!
It is bubur ketan hitam in Indonesia we eat it at burjoan ✨
Omg I miss u sooooo much!
the comment sec became wild.. lol.. welcome back takashima-san
Looks delicious ... I'm definitely going to be making this one.   It's nice to catch glimpses of your lovely new kitchen and it's interesting to observe the difference in acoustics compared with your former kitchen.  You've worked hard, and fast, at getting everything in order.  I appreciate that it's not easy, or straightforward, to plan a new kitchen which will beautifully accommodate -- in your unique style -- every item to your high and exacting standards; AND build most items of furniture yourself; AND do it all in the short time-span we have allotted to you!  Much love, and many thanks for the inspiration.
Looks amazing thx
i missed you!!
An upload! Yes! I love you!
今晩わ😃✌️
Nice video!  I have a similiar recipe with semolina and chia seeds ^_^
bubur ketan hitam, bosqu..
Glad to see you are back!! :)
結婚して美味しいもの作って欲しい、、
I just made this, without fruit but still yum. Anyway we (indonesian) named it "bubur ketan hitam"
Ryoya-san, in Indonesia, we call this Bubur Ketan Hitam 😉
No Music, whats that? By the way 🤤
Soooo happy to have you back. Good god I've missed your amazing videos!
Finally another video uploaded!
Leí muchísimos comentarios, pero no encontré nada que diga que es el Pol o que echa en la cocción, imagino algún tipo de espesante, pero no lo conozco, alguien sabe que es?
I'm so happy to see you posted! Thank you!
Lovely video! Thank you so much for uploading!! I've never seen black rice before (only on YouTube) but this is the first time I learnt that when you wash black rice the water turns purple! It's brilliant :D how is the rice black anyway?
Ahhhhhhh. I've missed this!

Bubur ketan item ini mah

Gordon ramsay? What r u doing in korea?
Magical. Relaxing and appetizing.
Wow, cooking black rice with a white shirt... that's bold XD
Has any one tried making this using the exact ingredients? How did it turn out ? Very curious to know x
In India, we call it as paravannam !!
Can you speak English? @Peaceful Cuisine
in India this is called KHEER with a dash of saffron and almonds.. made with white rice.. try once
The sound feels quite aggressive....I
miss you!!
Finally!  Its been a long long timeee
ずっと待ってました！
ありがとうございます！

Hello 👋
👍
In my country we called it black rice porridge
Looks delicious!
Looks like someone got inspired
immune to demonitization
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
2:56 se le ve la cara :\/
If you come to my country you probably find this at any wedding ceremony
anyone no idea what filter he uses on his videos?
Did you use the glutinous black rice or just the normal one? That looks like the gloutinous one in my local market because the colour is tad purple😁😁
NEVER LEAVE ME AGAIN
Is it just me or do all Asian cooking channels have the prettiest looking ingredients?
After it got mixed whit the sugar , the black rice looked like chocolate chips.
Something is different about this video. Can’t put my finger on it
Yummy.. 👍😊
I’m missing the cats
KING
🧡🧡🧡
First
日本のコンビニで唯一食べれる物とかあったらおしえてください
I NEVER understand why humans ear RICE .... ewwwwww
Go to nearest burjo, order one, tell the guy dont put anything except the black rice, bring it home, open it. Then put the rest recipe just like in the video.
Here in Indonesia, we usually soak the black rice for like +3 hours before we cook it, because it will take some time to cook the black rice and make it tender. And then add freshly squeezed coconut milk when you are ready to prepare the pudding ; you can also add some cooked mung bean, and eat with some bread. Heaven.
✳️👍✳️👍✳️👍
Ini kan jenang ketan item???
Why the palm sugar, if I may ask?
Wow im sitting here in a real fur lined coat eating a bacon cheeseburger and watching your video! so peaceful :D
Someone needed Youtube money
Is that black glutinous rice?
Hey, does anyone know what is the last one? A fla?
Does it work with white rice ?
Are you a moslem?
Se que tiene que prosperar y de más, pero en la antigüa cocina me gustaba más en decoración y mejores tomas. y se nota mucho que ahora le pagan las marcar (la leche de coco a cambiado A si de repente) pero sigue siendo un buen video a ver si mejora el entorno
Rice and sugar!!
 no thanks 🙅‍♀️
What type of black rice did he used?
ini mah bubur ketan
Very nice and useful cooking videos!
You back!!! I did so miss you !!
Looks delicious. I have some red rice wonder if it will taste the same as black.
You should start adding end screen too ... How many of you agree with me ?
ya need to get rid of the winky face on the bo music videos
I actually forgot about your channel because I haven't been seeing it. Then while watching Kiwami Japan, I remembered you. Must have something to do with knives. Lol. So I went and checked your latest video.
Oh. Is your kitchen done?
I watch these with my guinea pig on my lap and she loves the noises. She stops munching on her apple when she hears a sound she likes and pokes her little nose out of her blanket
Wowie, I'm here 12 minutes after it went live! Big, big fan of your work!
Meh, the sound effects need improving.  Included far too much noise that isn't pleasant.  Also, this recipe looks very average.
finally after 10000 years waiting for your video =D
has 30209 machines for roasting, grinding, brewing coffee
uses a handheld can opener
Congrats 🎉 on the 1st vid in the new kitchen

I see that you worked hard on the shooting angles
So happy to see that you are back! You make the best cooking videos on youtube
黒米の水切りで白シャツの無事を思わず祈ってしまった笑
In Indonesia we called it 'Bubur Ketan Hitam', but I never saw people eating it with fruit here, it may be taste good though. Anyway, such a good video as always! Now I'm craving this bubur ketan hitam........
is that.. mango? that is the cutest and most innocent mango i have seen.
That's so funny; I watched one of your older videos yesterday and said to myself, "wow, it's been a little while, I hope everything is okay and he comes out with another video soon." You're so unique and provide awesome content, thank you!
omg ive never clicked so fast
料理動画待ってました！綾也さんの料理動画に水道が出てくるのが新鮮でした😁 所作の音が前のキッチンより響きますね。

it's like a better version of mango sticky rice. thank you for sharinggggg!
Watching your videos are so soothing. With or without music, it makes me feel relaxed. I also love the way you record and edit 😌 So glad I found you on YouTube.
相変わらずお洒落な動画ですね✨カッコいいっす👍カセットコンロも一緒に引っ越して来ててちょっと嬉しくなりました。

ARROZ DOCE. DE UM OUTRO JEITO!!!!  MAS E. ARROZ DOCE,,,,, AMEI!!!!
I subscribe immediately after watching 2 of your videos... thank you for all of ur effort :)
Congratulations on posting the first video in your new kitchen! I'm sure this is such a big step for you. Thanks for making these videos.
Congrats to your project of your new kitchen, so well done and beautiful done And thank you for sharing this dessert , that we had been waiting for your recipes 🙏🙏🙏😍😍
なんだかよくわかんないけど、美味しそう
待ってました！
タイマーかっこよい！
Beras ketan hitam, we call it..in Indonesia
And i love it so much, thank you for sharing :))
So good to see you again! How about a tour of the kitchen? We watched you build it. It would be nice to see the finished project.
Love, love, love your videos
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
待ってましたぁ〜☆
はぁー見てて癒されるっ！
I missed your videos so much! Thanks for coming back! I know how hard must be finding a good idea (yours are the best), filming and editing in such artistically way (it's like a movie!). Just let you know how much peaceful I feel after watching your videos. I can't stop thinking ''I truly wanna be myself and enjoy small moments in life''. 
Once again, thanks a lot for your efforts and pieces of art! 
Hope see you soon :)
Instead of coconut milk can I use soy milk instead?
Your videos are so calming and lovely 💕 thank you
So glad you're back to making these videos :)
Looking forward to the progression of your new kitchen!
Yeah so nice of you, was waiting soooooo long for a new recipe🤗
Watching your videos makes me wonder what a generous, kind, warm and compassionate human being you must be.  So much goodness in all your videos. Love them <3 Thanks for making these beautiful cooking videos :)
Oh, great idea to add some fruits! I like the taste of black rice pudding but thought it was always a bit too 'heavy'.  Wonder what other fruits might work... Pineapple maybe?
なんかもう、神聖。。
Love your channel, what is the brand of your  Pot with the drawing in ? Love this simplicity and it look like very high quality cuisine equipement :)
I see that tan >.> you've been wearing gloves...
Thank you for not giving the amounts on grams! Cups and spoons are easier to follow
Thanks for sharing a super soothing vid, i love coconut milk just like you 😊
aww i remember you wondering if you could use your actual stove for the vids in this kitchen since the natural light was good but nope, back at it again with the smol cute old stove 😂💕 loved the vid.
OOoh cooking videos are back! <3
A souvenir from Nusa Penida 

Nice video Ryoma !!

Hope U enjoyed the trip........
Finally! I've been waiting months for this.
Love watching your videos. Thank you for the hard work you put into them!
Thanks so much for the recipe. Will try it!
I strongly suggest you to add mung bean (緑豆) to the pudding mix, and add just some more coconut milk liquid. In Indonesia we call it "Bubur Kacang Ijo" and its so delicious, it's lethal. 😁
I keep focused on those tridatu bracelet 😍. Thanks for visiting Bali!
Yum! I just happen to have black rice and coconut milk in my pantry. Treats on me!       Thanks for posting.
In Vietnam, we name "Nep cam". It is usually eaten with yogurt and fruit. Mango is the best choice. Nice to see you again.
久しぶりのキッチン動画待っていました！
いつも通り美味しいそうでね。
また、手作りレシピ動画アップお願いします。
待ってました！嬉しくて泣きそう！
I always have to switch the sound off in these videos, the noises make me anxious 🤣
1.Black rice or black glutinous rice / sticky rice? 
2. IDK but either the song dont match or back sound too loud but it's seems like in a hurry vibe.
3. But then again it's a great content 😁😁😁
新しいおしゃれ道具がー😂タイマーレトロでかわいいですね！
前から思っていましたが、シリコン スパチュラでなにか混ぜるシーンが
いつもやたら”優しい”感じで落ち着きます。（笑）
This is amazingly beautiful <3
in indonesia, we call it "ketan" and thats my fav dessert 💕😆
No way! Finally you're back ❤️
Incrible! Perfect Video...
Success, always.
Hugs from Brazil...  #dgtudo
Thank youuuu
I would definitely try it 🙆🙆
う…美味そう…
you must be inspired with 'bubur ketan hitam' when you visited Bali, right? ^^
it's one of my favorite dessert <3 Thank you for the video!
OMG THANK YOU!  I have a test tomorrow and watching your videos helps destress me 😭😭😭
Straight up ASMR after so many DIYs!
I want to know the inspiration source for this recipe because we have the same kind of recipe in India 🇮🇳 but with white rice!
Love the vid ♥
おおおおお1000年ぶりの料理動画ですね ずっと待っていました 笑笑
In thai it's call "มะม่วงข้าวเหนียวมูน" kaa~
Aww.. you got me first :p
I was just about to send you the Indonesian version recipe of this, almost similar, but with black sticky rice and addition of mung beans and coconut milk cream.
Your videos ARE so peaceful and visually beautiful!
Ryoya san, great job on the new video! I'd say, if one's not paying attention, he'd rather mistake it as something shot in the former kitchen. What is it called? Quality Control! LOL Please do keep up the good work, can't wait to see the next one.
i missed your videos so much! thank u for uploading!
Never clicked on a video so fast. It’s great to see you cooking in your new kitchen!!!!
Welcome back !! I was waiting for you for a long time now... Please keep posting ! 😊👍
Nice reminds me with indonesia traditional snack : black glutinous rice with coconut cream 😍
新しいキッチンもいい雰囲気ですね〜😳💖
I really enjoy your work, it transmit lots of peace and love.
ありがとうございます。わたしの癒しです。
YEYYYYY FINALLY NEW VIDEO! I'm so happy to see you again!
Also, Thanks for the recipe. It's vegetarian festival in Thailand now, so I'll give it a try :)
はやこめ！！！
久しぶりのビーガン料理だー！！！

ココナッツフレークって、かるでぃのアレでも代用できるね？うん、できるわ(笑)
...and Mr. Takashima is back.  Missed you.  Good Job on your video. Love it.
Ohh new style with white shirt, please show all over you :3
New bracelet from your newest trip to Malaysia right?
So beautiful, my prince 😘
I love your recipes and your videos. They are really peaceful ♥ . Thank you!
Oh, is it the first recipe in your new kitchen ? I was so sad to see you leaving your previous one... I don’t really like your new flat in Kyoto but you did something great in your new kitchen 💖 I follow you from France, near Paris.
Welcome back. I like your style. Keep up the good work.
missed your videos! you made me really happy now (:
Portable stove is back, everyone! :)
Omg. After travelling long way around, you do come back to your kitchen. 😂
FINALLY YOU POST A RECIPE VIDEO IN YOUR NEW KITCHEN!!!!!
First video in your new place!!! It looks very good, nice lighting. Looking forward to many more...Wait! you didn't use maple syrup, you got me hooked to that stuff ;)
Thanks I've been wanting to make this recipe.
わ〜！！！もう終わっちゃったのかと思ってました！待ってました！嬉しいです😄😄
I wosh it didnt have to be coconut milk bcuz im allergic 🙁🙁
Iam from Egypt we don't have black rice and i have never seen it bofore😂😂😂😂💔
Yes, am myself from Indonesia 🇮🇩 and we don’t put fruits on top. But why not add fruits right? We usually just cook it with Pandan leaves to have that extra aroma from the pandan leaves. Thanks for sharing this video
I'VE MISSED THIS SO MUCH!!
😍😍😍
that coconut milk can opening? Hot. 🔥
We usually eat black rice with yogurt in Viet Nam,sometimes we do add fruits but yogurt is just the best choice :)))
Great video; thank you! Good luck in your new home. Looking forward to more great videos!
Delish 😍🤗      Finally you're back!
🍉🌵🌶
I think i just fell in love with you all over again! That was beautiful done. Congratulations sweetheart
I love your cooking videos. Thanks so much!
As an information, you can make green beans (mung bean) porridge and eat it with black rice with a lot of coconut milk (add water to make it watery, easily to eat)
And congratulations peaceful cuisine is back!
The vibe is indeed different from before, and to be honest i like the old one better.
Probably bcause some shoot was too close and it feels narrower.
I'm sure you'll find better angle next time.
I'll be waiting for your next recipe :)
このビデオのおかげで、私が癒された…
This is one of my fav desserts! Its a popular dish in South East Asia.
But best not to make too often, fattening :D
やったー! Finally these kind of videos!! Please do more <3
Some ecstatic is gone. The editing method is not as usual. Something is off in this video. The speed or the sound? This is a bit hectic rather than the smooth like previous video.
It's the first time I know black rice pudding. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Can't wait the next new video!
I've been waiting so long , thanks for coming back ♥
Welcome back and great wishes for this new adventure! Thanks so much :)
新しい料理動画凄い待ち遠しかった…
You’re back. I love watching your videos, they’re so healing
Mango fingers in the coconut bag... ahhhhh!
I'm very, VERY glad you're back
I feel like i just meditated 😮
I really like that equipment that you use! What pot is that? Is it aluminum, steel, etc?
OMG you made pulut hitam! I miss this dish so badly.. 🙁
Also you can try with fresh young coconut meat while half boiling rice.
Bubur ketan item 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bubur ketan hitam 😋
it was waiting for a new video about the kitchen ... but it s good that you made new videos ... thanks for sharing always enjoy your videos
"Good Artists Copy; Great Artists Steal" 😂 we want to steal ur lifestyle though it's not easy
missed so much! thank you.
we call it 'bubur ketan hitam' in Indonesia. the taste will be perfect if you combine it with jackfruit. but i will definitely try this (with mango)
結局カセットコンロ？笑
It looks really delicious, the color of the mango is beautiful
Love your videos.. Hugs from Denmark
Missed you !!
Jesus! At one point I felt like I could almost smell the cooked rice!! It also took me back to my childhood but I've never tried black rice or tasted coconout milk so what the hell man? I guess you have a gift. 
Powerfull video...
04:15 damn that knife skill is so neat
Is this the equivalent to Arroz Con Leche?
引きでも見たいですね部屋全体のやつ！
新しいキッチンでの動画楽しみにしてます( ᐛ )و
this looks delicous! thank you!
So satisfying... 😊👍
Haaa, finally...
In thai sticky rice + sugar we call ข้าวเหนียวมูล if have mango we call ข้างเหนียวมะม่วง

ข้าวเหนียวมูล - KAW NEAW MOOL
ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง - KAW NEAW MA MUANG

and coconut milk we call กะทิ KA TI
I almost prefer this without the music. The sounds of making the food are so satisfying :)
Amazing video as always 😋. Will you be filming an apartment tour soon? 🙈
It is called bubur pulut hitam (black rice porridge) in malaysia. We add coconut milk and pandan leaves for more fragrance! Oh and we have it as ice cream too. One of my favorite dessert. Thank u for ur cooking video!
What language is that? I recognize most languages but not this one.
まってた！！
In Malaysia we called it Bubur pulut hitam ( black rice porridge ) , I am so inspired , we are in London for a short break hence the cravings and some is now boiling in a pot for tea time treats
新しいキッチン良いですね〜
Yesssss! My mom is making the Filipino version of this right now (: she likes putting jackfruit on top
Finally😩 I've been waiting years
That is a beautiful mango. Wow.
You can almost just taste the flavours in the foods you make! No need to eat or taste..because the visuals and sounds are SO good sensations! :) Thank you for all you do.
Glad to have your beautiful food back!
So relaxing content, it's been a while since your last video 👍
Used to work at a Thai restaurant this was on the menu it's super kick ass everyone here should try it lol
Missed you, love the background music, the sounds from all you do, and let's not forget the awsome recipes. I love rice pudding,  I'll have to look for black rice. Maybe even save the pretty rice water to use for coloring some craft.
I’m so happy to see a new video from you again! Congrats on your new house!
That looks delicious! I must try it! also topped with whipped cream and fruit of choice would it been amazing too.
If you get a water filter for your sink you don't have to use plastic bottles! Great video, I'd love to try this recipe :)
Are you really back? Finallyyy!😍😍😭
黒米のおかゆなんですね｡
食べたらすごく癒されそう🍀
優しい感じがします｡
You should try "bubur ketan hitam kacang ijo" it's almost similar but green beans makes nore sweetness
時計🕰が物凄くオシャレで、良いですね。少しアンティークな感じが好きです。
Aye he is back
Was this inspired by your trip to Bali?
wow.. new
AAAAAAAAHHHHH YOURE FINALLY BACK AND ITS IN YOUR NEW KITCHEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I MISSED THIS (AND YOU) SO MUCH ♥♥♥♥
どんな味なんだろう？食べてみたい🙂
関係ないけど白シャツいいですね🙌お姿が見たかった･･･💦
That was a beautiful dessert , love how dark the rice color is ❣️ thank you love all your videos you post ❣️😀
I've been wondering, do you miss Norway and Lofoten? Would you ever go back to Norway?
白い腕時計になってる笑

マンゴー美味そう
This is the only channel when I actually watch the whole videos mostly I will just skip to the finished product
Happy to see his handsome delicate hands again....here.
Acá en Argentina a eso se lo conoce como arroz con leche  <3
fianlly,  A RECIPE/
That's is sth like "sữa chua nếp cẩm nhưng không có sữa chua" :))
These videos are so happy and nostalgic, like a memory of childhood. :)
....thank you for making 😋
身体に良さそうですね☆綾也さんの白いシャツ姿が素敵すぎ♡♡
I misread the title as Black Pudding, made me wonder which vegan on earth eats a black pudding. Silly me.
i clicked like before the vid even starts lol
Heyyy Glad to ser you!!
In Philippines this treat is called Biko!
It so nice that he uses "peaceful" music than UPBEAT music...
Welcome back you been missed 🍜🍧🍨🍮🍵
Japanese writing, especially the simplified version, looks so clean
I made it today and it's delicious! Thank you so much!
Not so peaceful anymore. He used to be so gentle and relaxing, now it's just rough and not relaxing anymore.
Finally you are back 🤗
Omg finally youre back T_T
タイマーもおしゃれ。使い方の謎が解けた💡
Why do you use cups as a measurement? They don't use grams in Japan? Most of the world use metric, not cups. Anyway, I'm glad to see a new recipe on here.
I love it but I feel like your actions are so aggressive at times 😂😅 I love the bgm tho
That looks delicious! I’m definitely trying this one. ❤️🍨
FINALLY!!! MISS YOU RYO!
It looks similiar like bubur ketan hitam from Indonesia.😊
Pulut hitam in Malaysia but now I will go make myself some. Yummy 😋 and thank you
i am so interested to do this
temennya bubur kacang ijo gengs 🙃
Looks like açai to me, even the mango and coconut is there
You forgot to mention sugar in the instructions in description.
Welcome back, youtube was missing your videos :)
Looks very similar to Turkish dessert “sutlaç” .In Extra we add mastic or lemon zest .My favorite is mastic.
yeaaay! a shoot from the new kitchen :)
I want to thank you for uploading a cooking video. It's worth the wait. Gochisousama deshita XD. Could it be that you got this from your last trip to Bali? In Indonesia, we call this black sticky rice. Sometimes I replace the coconut milk with condensed milk.
Simmer it with pandan leaves, tied into knot (one leaf is already more than enough) will give it a nice scent, a bit of South East Asian desert feel to it :)
In indonesia we called it puding ketan hitam
落ち着く音だ　しかもｳﾞｨｰｶﾞﾝ料理なので抵抗なく観れる
looks yummy, will try this for this weekend but last time I try to cook black rice it took for over to cook 😂😅😅
きた、美味しいそう♥️♥️✨
Nice! Thank you :)
Damn I missed this. ^^
such quality content
Arigato Senpai
no sugar?
In Indonesia, it's called ketan hitam :)
finallyyyyy
welcome back ;-)
In indonesia we called it bubur ketan hitam 😊
you should open  your own café or restaurant, it will be sooooo succesfull.
餡子みたいなのかな？味の想像がつかない🤤けど美味しそうです
Your cooking is magical
Bubur ketan hitam kalo di Indo mah😂
赤い研ぎ汁にも栄養が有りそうな感じがします。
Yay!  Cooking in the new home!
うわっ。待ってました！！
美味しそう。
He's like if howtobasic was legit
when you are stirring at 3:32 it reminds me of oatmeal for some reason 😂
have with some yogurt is the best!!
So nice and simple. Gonna make it this weekend and share it with friends!
that little wooden spoon at the end <3
1st cooking video at new house and kitchen! nice!
ブラックライスプディング！！
初めて海外で食べた時はお米が甘い？って変に思ったけど美味しい。
癖になる味だし無性に食べたくなる！
黒米って初めて知ったなぁ。
味が想像つかないけど美味しそう(’-’*)
I was going through some of the old videos last night seeing it was over 6 months since your last upload and now you upload one... This isn't just luck or is it? :) Amazing video anyway, I love to watch these.
The fact he didnt rinse the rice on the flow water really bothered me
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I’m from Vietnam and in our country we eat this pudding together with plain yogurt. It’s really delicious. For a vegan version, I think that the combination of black rice pudding and soy yogurt (your recipe) maybe a good idea
Champoradoというフィリピンの伝統的なチョコレートデザートみたい!!
I always eat this for breakfast, in Indonesian it is called "Bubur ketan hitam". I also like to mix it with ice :D
Try adding pandan leaves in the black rice, it will smell sooo good
新しいキッチンでの料理動画待ってました☆
黒米とマンゴーの対比が綺麗ですね♩
DIYの動画も待ってます(^^)
Yasssssss. Been waiting for your return
Hello Ryoya, could you make a video on how to make a tofumisozuke ? (if you know how to ;)) Thank you !

俺もこんなふうに料理ができるようになりたい…
Eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
bubur ketan hitam dong haha
I’ve missed you!
Somehow I really liked setting up timer scene, and the sound ticking which looked just like a movie. Oh yes. That is "Peaceful Cuisine."
Combine with yogurt will be tasty too. It's a popular dessert in Vietnam.
Such a pleasure to watch your videos!
今日もオシャレ✨
久々の料理動画嬉しいです！
りょうやさんの白シャツがなんか新鮮
Oh! that Thai coconut milk.
Get inspired while doing vacation at Bali, right? ^^

This looks great! I love rice pudding and usually make mine with vanilla and cinnamon. The black rice is a really good idea.
Love your videos with all the sounds.  Thanks for inspire me to cook😊
Could you please change your video format from 16:9 to the actual format of your videos? Because when I view them on my 19:9 phone I always have large black bars on all sides. And when I zoom in the notch covers a part of the video. It would be so great If you could change it. I love enjoying your videos so much! 💓
Ahhhh!!! New video in the new kitchen!! So exciting

how can you cook black rice in 45 minutes? I use to soak black rice here for like 2 days, and it still takes more than 1 hour for it to be soft. I always eat it "al dente" cause I can't wait for more than 1h hour.
YUHHH HES BACK
loveeeeee
新しいキッチンでのお料理も素敵☺️
Finallyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!
OMG IV BEEN WAITING ON YOU AND ILL WAIT YEARS FOR YOUR IGNORE THE HATERS

I missed you
I enjoy this more compared to the no music one..
く、黒米だからとぎ汁も黒い！！
Is he married? 😂
did you just come bak from bali? why are you using tridatu bracelet?
It is  ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง (sticky rice and mango)  It very delicious.
I feel like I've seen a million things with black rice in them just today. Ads, videos, photos. Weird. Maybe I'm supposed to try it.
Like 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧uk

ダルトンのキッチンタイマーよりも精度が高そうな、かっこいいタイマー
I feel this new Kitchen made me a bit sad ... maybe because of the background ?!! Anyone here feel like me
this is basically therapy
Gonna cook this tonight and serve it to my girlfriend tomorrow for her birthday. Perfect timing and awesome video! :D
Good man!
Nice to have you back
3:43 NAJMAR!
タイマーおしゃんすぎ
Thank you.
what are those can openers called
Wow I've never seen a can opener like that before
久しぶりのりょうやさんのお料理動画🌸
今回も素敵な動画ありがとうございます☺︎
a nice color contrast with black rice and white coconuts milk...
Beautiful as always
Simple and nice!
いさしぶち！
Really beautiful video, but I just don't get the appeal of black rice... doesn't seem to be at ALL appetizing.  Seems like just a fad.
お久しぶりでーす。
全部ビーガン、ビーガン・プディング。白米とバナナもいかが？
sticking to the sink bottom insulation or vibration isolation and the sink will not be so noisy
Love it!
Do you simmer with low heat ?
Ah, he ended up still using the portable stove after all ^^. But I like it though, it adds to the familiarity and nostalgia from your older kitchen
Song ?
oooh pulot hitam yum
Like!
I have to wonder what Ryoya would think of Auntie Fee
動画UP待ってました。ありがとう。
What is the song called?
心を込めて作りました。インドネシアからのあいさつ
In Vietnam we called it " chè nếp cẩm " , black rice called " nếp cẩm .
This reminds me of champorado, but without the chocolate :) looks yummy!
its like indian kheer
ohhhhh welcome back!!!!
HEAVEN side of youtube
amazing!!!!!!!
what you put in for last step？ milk，coconut milk or something else？
ブラックライスもプディングも一体何なのかわからない…
お料理動画待ってました！
新しいお家で初めてのお料理動画かな？
いつもと同じようですが、音が響いたり水道が出てきたりちょっといつもと違う感じがワクワクしますね、、、！
今回も楽しませて頂きました😆
why am i so sad when this video ended
Watching this video  made me cry,took me back to my childhood in Mexico when my mom  used to make Rice pudding once a week for dessert  ,and the music is so soothing
vegan is bad.
waiting for room tour video!!!'
If you made this with white rice (because you don't have black rice) would the water ratio still be 2:1?
yummy
Finally a new video
OMG!!! 😲😲😲🤤🤤🤤🤤
What's the brand of your cool timer and where did you get it?
Dapurnya udh beres?
Looks great, can't wait to make it!
Add to plain yogurt

か〜〜っ何もかもセクシー
In Vietnam, we eat this with yogurt on top (sometimes shaved ice) and call it “sữa chua nếp than” !
These utensils are straight from Ghibli movies.
Deutsche hier ?
I’m using this to wake up right now
do you know that this is called BUBUR KETAN HITAM in Indonesia. one of my favoriteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee fooooooooooooooooooooood
that makes my tummy growl, that loooks sooooo goooooooooooooooooooooooooood
久々のお料理動画、ありがとうございます。お疲れ様です。
黒米…どんなお味なんでしょう？
私にはわかりませんが、黒いのと甘味と、となったら善哉みたいなかんじなのですかね🤔
That’s ok :)
こんにちは！ヴィーガンや糖質制限でも食べれるシュトーレン作り方見てみたいです
お久しぶりです❗新しいお部屋どうですか？また動画見させて頂きます🍀
You make a big batch. Do you share the food with others or do you eat it for a couple days?
I always wondered if all the juice from the rice is healthy for us, its always rich in color/cloudiness and usual indication of color/cloudiness in nature is richer in nutrients? Nice video, missed your simple amazing videos! TIP in some tradition they soak rice like beans overnight they say its better for digestion/cooking.
😃👍
Probably nice, but looks aesthetically ugly.
It's black sticky rice, right? Sticky or not will have different results
We have similar dish like this in Malaysia called 'bubur pulut hitam' or 'black glutinous-rice porridge'. I don't really know how to make it but I think the ingredients are basically similar.
You are not washing your rice after soaking it... are you implementing this method only for desserts to preserve some of that starch for thickness, (as black rice is naturally gluten free), or is it for colour?
黒米食べるけど、デザートにしよっていう発想はまったくなかったなぁ。どこから思いつくのかなぁ。作ってみます。
りょーやさんの料理動画ってどうしてこんなに気持ちが安らぐのだろう。
料理の作り方を見にきてるのではなく安眠のためにいつもお世話になってます笑
ずっと気になってたんですけど、使ってる計量カップってどこの物ですか？
おしゃれなタイマーはどこのやつですか？
やっと動画出たー！！！！(>_<)
最後にのせていたフルーツは何ですか？
Can i replace black rice with white rice ?
What’s the name of the song? It’s super pretty
So long times <3
nice and yummy
イメージとしてはあんこみたいな感じですかね、、、？
I’m gonna make this, but would like to know if that’s glutinous rice or black rice?
新居でのレシピ動画ｷﾀ━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━!!黒いお米とな・・・・・？どこで買ったんですか？なんだか小豆っぽいような・・・・？ｗ
You're back!
I just love how he does almost everything by himself. Most people would just buy a table you just need to put together, but he does the damn thing all from the start. I really hope your kitchen gets more awesome than the last one. And i am a bit confused... Where did you put all the stuff you had in the other kitchen? :O
"But I didn't sub for THIIIIS!  ;n;  Make food videos already!  GAH!"  Um...  How about sit down and zip it?  Do you not see he has to get his kitchen in order before he can even consider making a food video?  Ungrateful pests; go watch his other videos, in the mean time!  The rest of us are just fine.  I, for one, quite enjoy seeing the progress he's making!  ^^
I like how this has started to become a DIY channel for the time being. And I don't mind even though I originally came here for your cooking and food videos :D I can't wait to see your finished kitchen.
I can't believe you actually made it entertaining to watch you make kitchen shelves. Like what?
i really like that there were letters on the edges and the nails were painted with the same color!
I only worry about him smashing his pinky toe at night
I love how the wood Ryoya buys comes in a box. This is several paychecks invested in this project. Well done, sir!
I'm so impressed by the fact that you're so independent. Marry me!...😂
R u an engineer??? U know exactly what to do.
Wow. Japan companies are great! Whatever you request for they do their best to adjust their product just for you. And the effort they put in to making things is what makes Japan products so good!!
Just woke up. This is great...
❣Hi, Ryoka, still thinking about the 'wooden puzzle' you created? Must be dry now🤔... Hope you are well. Greetings from Germany, Monika❣
DIY動画楽し〜！あと動作全て、編集、音楽と、ノンストレスで見れるのがサイコー！
Ryoya 'Peaceful' describes you perfectly 💓
Hi from Turkey! (*⌒∇⌒*) You're the master of cooking! And  i have a favor from you that can you share with us healthy tea recipes please? Winter is coming, so we all need that i think. 🍵
I love watching you work :)
台風大丈夫だったのですね…安心しました＾＾…素敵ですね☆
When are coming the new videos of the kitchen build??? I love this series! I am really curious how this will end up. The new apartment looks amazing! I can't stop looking at those concrete walls.
I miss your masculine hands cooking gently.
Hi, I just watched your Channel this morning and I just noticed that you have many follower so I understood because your vdo is so awesome . I was watched since 11:00 am until 23:00 pm. Lol . Love it . Like your fixed and decorated and your cooked too. Keep it . Super great!
I was supposed to do my school work but you're my perfect distraction at the moment
Looking forward to your next update of your kitchen shelves.
Hola man!!! Has long Time with dont news about you! I follow you, are you ok? Send you   light fron Chile!
I can already hear the many people going "omg don't hold that knife like that. Omg don't use it like that" LoL. Can I just say that this is so therapeutic to me.
That metal structure looks very dirty/worn; is that the way its supposed to be?
This is so incredibly relaxing to watch. Beautiful!
I really love this series ! Thank you for the video :-)
Loved your series on your kitchen setup. I got some great ideas for my own kitchen. I'll love seeing you create in your new studio.
りょうやさんが使用されている時計のモデル名が知りたいです！！！！！
重ね塗りで変化を出すのではなく、各々の発色違いの色を買いそろえるとは……贅沢～✨
よかですね！
LOL when you said different colors I thought you were saying chromatic colors... I was going to say “wuut??” 😂
Ryoyaさんのdiy動画いつもほんと素敵ですね。真似します！！
Are the iron pieces expensive? I'm thinking about building something similar to my PC desk. 🤔
Bruh, I just realized his old kitchen had no sink.
Congratulations, Friend!! Beautiful... 
Success, Always!   #dgtudo
Where's the new kitchen tour? We'd love to see how it all turned out??  :)
VERY coool. I love it. I'm refinishing a piece of furniture...this is keeping me inspired. ♡
Loving the DIY videos and seeing your face more ! :3
third time's the charm🤗🤗
You are good at everything👍💗
How much more do they charge for special order like yours?
really nice work! thank you!
憧れます✨
One day, I wish to have superhuman DIY powers, so I can make the kitchen of my dreams too. 😆
love your videos!  But they are too short for me. I need longer ones :D

All videos are great but will you be able.to make a video of a vegan sausage?
This guy would make an incredible husband!
Wow. Anyways, typhoon Jebi just hit Japan, hope you're safe there in   Kyoto.
I love your DIY videos !
still no original Victorinox pocketknife? xD
Missing your vlogs. Hope to see something new soon 😊
I hope the work gets completed soon, and we can see you cook. The Tudor looks nice by the way.

I equally love your diy and your food making videos. All of them made me feels nice and calm. Can't wait for more videos 😄
このシリーズめっちゃ楽しいです。ぜひぜひ今後もDIY系続けてください！
Where’s the finished kitchen we want to see it!❤️
ナットにワッシャーないと緩んできませんかね？
Aw man, I was hoping to see the finished product! Those colors look really pretty together.
Awesome company.

なんか、お金かけて物買って作るYouTuberになっちゃったよね。あんまり、こんな言い方したくないけど、前はもう少し工夫をされながらDIYしててそれを見てるのが楽しかった。今は、なんかあまりそれを感じない。りょうやさんがこのコメントを見てくれるとは思ってないし、とは思うけど思わずコメントしてしまった。最近、りょうやさんの動画から遠ざかっています。単純に、好みの問題と言われればそれまでですが。私は好きではないのでもうりょうやさんのチャンネル見ないと思います。
Un poco de todo 👌🏻
こんにちは
隅にみつけて気になったので。
iPadをよく使われるのですか？（Macbookなどよりも）
いいねーー！
あなたが話す方法を大好き
木材は通販なんですね。木材屋さんちょっと探してみよー
Beautiful love ❤️ the colored wax 👍🏼
待ってました！！台風大丈夫でしたか？？
ラ・パボーニの横に置いてあるコーヒーミルが気になってしまった^^;
When the kitchen's done, a before and after picture at the end of the last video would be cool :)
完成が楽しみです
Man the amount of tools and equipments you have to build just a few tables! Mindblowing! Anyway how do you find the motivation to build your own shelves and tables? I mean you could simply buy right
Wha did you apply? Wax?

私は停電2日目突入です🤪
：）））））
Woods 🤤
What does he do for living??
You are hot af
I like how Ryoya puts effort, dedication and patience in everything he does. Must be something related to Japanese culture, something profoundly Zen.
We, in the west,  run all the day trying to accomplish more and more things done but where we run? For what?
I knew a 90 years old man able to make a perfect tailored   suit from scratch with an old Singer moved by a pedal, able to make shoes modelled around your foot.  Now is all lost, but I can see in Japan they still maintain their traditional crafts.
:D
nice industrial aesthetic.
マイク変えましたか
Ryoya is the only person who can make crocs look cool
お料理動画も待ってます（＾Ｏ＾）
Where you buy products?
I really, really love these shelves you're building - I'd love to do something similar in my kitchen!! I love the clean looking end result - I thought it might look to industrial for my taste with all the metal, but it's absolutely gorgeous ♥️
💖🇲🇽
Beeswax...
ビデオがアップされたのは、台風20号を無事に過ごしたということですね。良かったですね。台風が関西地方に直接影響を与えるって聞いたらすごく心配になりました。
I love these vlog videos!!! More　お願いします！！！
台風21号大丈夫でしたか？
is turning out really lovely!
Nice it’s coming together
I like his place. I would like to live in a place like that when I grow up. Is there a specific word for that type of house or apartment?
I wish I was one of those shelves. He can paint me all day.
引き出しの動画は出さないんですか？
Your home tour please..
Seconddddd
que entretenido ver esto!!!
I like all the different colors.
Why did you move from old house ?
どうも。ラーメンおじさんです🍜これは完成が楽しみですね〜🤗使っている木は足場板ですか？何の木材ですか？
I never clicked a video so fast 😱
Second?

But I also haven’t watched the video yet lol
I thought you were vegan, so WHY DO YOU USE BEESWAX !!!!!!
is he ever gonna upload a cooking video again
COOK PLEASE
Bro now please start with food vids I'm bored with this content
I've never been so obsessed with someone building a shelf 😂
It’s coming out so beautiful! I do , however, wish you would wear protective eyewear because you’re kinda worrying us a bit lol.
can’t wait for your first cooking video in the new kitchen 😆
Very cool can’t wait to see the finished product! Love how you’re customizing it to your needs!
There’s something so satisfying about making something by your own hands 😊
Magic hand... can handle everything .
You know what's more impressive than a self closing system? You are
tell me what you can't do?  :D  this is soooo coool!!
Oh the satisfaction of seeing that shelf roll into place!!  Loving every part of these videos!
Soft closing drawers are a must :-)
I like the way you accommodate your carpentry to accommodate available materials. Beautiful. ❤️
もう，このシーリズが楽しみでしょうがない
I'm looking forward to watching this series!!

I was getting ready to go to bed, now I'm binge watching your videos...there goes my beastly sleep.
いつも楽しく拝見しております。素敵なテーブルが出きていくのにワクワクしております。
さいきんの動画は私だけかもしれないのですが、少し音声が聞き取りづらい感じがします。かなり大きくするとBGMも大きいので大音量になってしまいます。
余計な事かも知れませんが気になりました。今後も素敵な動画楽しみにしております。
if there's anyone searching the song's name, it's Sunny, by Dj Quads. A toast for you from Spain!
またお菓子作り動画が見たいです！
時間が経つのを忘れるくらい魅入ってしまいます。是非お願いします
リョーヤさんは器用だから大丈夫だとはわかっているのですが、素手、半ズボン、素足で電気ノコギリ作業されているのが怖いです。室内で防護靴をはけとは言いませんが、何らかのケガ防止対策はしてほしいです。素足が一番怖いです。
AN YOU TELL ME THE NAME OF THE TRACK PLEASE. THANKS,,, NICE PAD BY THE WAY...
ス〜〜〜…ストン。

クセになる！！笑
設計通り…気持ちよすぎ！
Excited to the new kitchen.. slowly but surely
どうも。ラーメンおじさんです🍜めちゃくちゃかっこいいです👍お部屋完成動画楽しみにしてますね🤗
I was so amazed with all the machines as well as your kitchen tools. 
How can you so versatile? I am just so curious.
So my aesthetic. Nicely done! Self closing is music to my ears.
Here first because I live in youtube land
well done, once again! good luck with the other shelves ^_^! always a pleasure!
He can cook, is artistic and super handy around the house. Perfect husband material.
sometimes I think Ryoya-san is a person with a lot of personas :D each has their own skills and expertise
すごいっすね～、、板固定するのいいっすね～、、、、笑

いい勉強になります。
ありがと
This video series really makes me want to build my own furniture - but I already have everything I need! Oh no! 😂
セルフ締まり式すごいですねw
I´m impressed of all the things you know how to do - you are a genius!! Love your videos!!
すごいねー
This is my top 3 channels on YouTube ! Peaceful cuisine, Casey neistat and ZacDelight ! 

Ryoya you are amaizing ! 👍🏻😉
Freakin' awesome. I wish I can build custom selves in my kitchen!  LOL.
なんでもそうだけど…

好きじゃないと出来ない！w
Is there more channels like his on youtube, this is amazing!!!
The surface finish you achieved looks amazing :)
I always love the color you choose! Good luck on the 6 other shelves :)
you make it so well!!
I have the same vakuum cleaner, now I feel very proud :'D
I get so excited when I see a new video!  So relaxing, and I enjoy watching the transformation of your kitchen.
looking awesome =] great job, luv this series =] ; this is encouraging me to actually learn to weld so i can make some shelves like this =]
He is so skilled! Watching him create kinda everything he use, is an inspiration. So fascinating. Congrats! Xoxo
引き出し、お見事〜＼(^o^)／
直角に固定できるクランプがあるのか、便利だな。
初コメです！
今度使ってる道具(ドライバや台など)の紹介動画をあげてください！
どんなものを使ってるのか気になりなす！
This is fascinating to watch! And you cook too! 💖
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁

Love from Canada <3 thanks for the amazing content
When will you make food vids again? It’s been over 5 months since your last food vid. I hope you’ll find time making them again, more ideas to come mate!💪
Ryoya is just good at life.
めちゃ器用ですね…
にしても金の再生ボタンを地面に立て掛けるという…笑笑
登録者数にこだわってなくていいですね！
I love your videos 😍
Time for Q&A I think.
Love your hard work!! And thx I got some new ideas for my kitchen.. 😊😊👍👍
Greetings from Sweden! I love your videos, its great to see you build your kitchen. Keep it up!
カッコよくまとまって来てますね！
流石！
白いキッチンも何か考えていますか⁇
Please make Mochi in your new kitchen :)
Darn.  It's like he made every single thing in his house.  What else, Ryoya?  💕
作業が丁寧だから見ていて気持ち良いし、綺麗に仕上がっていく様子がとても楽しいです✨

続きの動画も楽しみにしてます♬
Con un hombre asi si me caso, se me figura que es super limpio ordenado y metodico como yo!  🙏🏻💗🙈
That's a lot of hard work. A lot..
粉塵は大丈夫か（笑）❔❔❔❔❔❔😂
素晴らしい!!!~ 😭😭
Out of curiosity, may I know what's the brand  and model for wireless vacuum cleaner is he using?
I’m really enjoying these wood work videos, it’s super cool watching how you assemble things from scratch!
You are one of a kind indeed🤩👏
Man, you need a wife asap.. life is short, build family, have children.. #whatAmITalking
すごい本当！👌🏽頑張れ😁💪🏽
Your an amazing young man.
Again... Love to see your work.😊
I like it when you say Youuush 😂
You made a miracle happen 😊
Wowww this is so much fun to watch!!!! Youre so skilled and smart!!

Do you just have all these power tools or do you rent them? It seems like a great collection!
DIYするときはダイソンのハンディタイプ良いですね

一発で入れやがった！！奇跡を起こしやがった！！毎回楽しみにしてます！！
you´re so skilled!
最近動画たくさん出してくれて嬉しい！
Good carpentry !! Wow
全部が整ったあとが楽しみ♪
どんなインテリアになるのかなと！
スリムネジ使うと板が割れなくて、頭も綺麗に収まっていいですよ！
すごい！
Yeeeeeah!!!!
Ryo, you’re the best! XD
初コメです！
何もんなんですか？
本職は何なんですか？
めっちゃ気になります！
Good work man and good luck for the rest
素晴らしい☆
Love your use of space. And your attention to detail. Can't wait to see the finished kitchen!
Still drilling metal without safety glasses....
工具が揃っていますね。
you're the best
Can you make a strudel in your next video
Bạn khỏe ko?hy vọng nhìn thấy nhiều video của bạn.chúc bạn sức khỏe và may mắn
りょうや頑張りすぎないでね(*_*)
電動ノコギリが迫って来たようで恐怖を感じた。🙀少しづつ出来上がって行くのが楽しいです。次回を待っています。
Dont do this if you have a 9 to 5 job lol. This takes like 3 full days maybe 4
It looks good but I do think you can go lighter on the shelf materials, use thiner plywood at least for the bottom of the drawer.
ほんと面白い
Great! now I can cook and be a carpenter as well 😂
That's cool, soft close
Very impressive👏💗
一寸の狂いもなく一発で引き出しが入るとは！！プロもびっくりだww恐れ入りましたww完璧主義がなせる業やああああｗ
The new kitchen is going to be amazing.
Woohoo! New DIY!
4:11 when you drill in the screws looks like they broke the side panel some bit. I don't think the weight of the drawer will transfer to that part, but I'm worried if it gets worse in the future. Maybe you can review it later or apply some patches to it.
Man all those tools are amazing. i didnt know all those things even existed. i want them all. lmao :D
is there no balconies or sidewalks in japan? curious all the mess thats made in the kitchen, id cut all my stuff outside but thats just me
He has the right tools for all the jobs.
根性あるなー。面白く拝見しました！
You are amazing!!!!
Great content as usual
is there anything you cant do?
このアイアンは特注ですか？
peaceful shelf-making
それは素晴らしいよ！どのような素晴らしい仕事！私はそれが完了したらそれを見るのを待つことができない！
動画を見ながらモンスターを飲むのが、最近の楽しみです！
It was interesting ;)
it's cool but the colour of the pine cabinet doesn't match the rest of the wood :(
Like it 👌🤗
あれ？建具屋さんですか⁉️

さすがりょうやさん！上手にするわ！見ていていいてすね
😄👍👍👍
Love you so much.
たいへんだぁ〜がんばりぇ〜
引き出し完ぺきですね（≧∇≦）
こういうのは意外といろんなとこに干渉するので凄い一発完成
Suck my toe UwU
Start Vlogging?
こだわりの極み！
Looks great!
Good job
くいじんさーんみてますよーー
ほんとさすがですわ。DIY慣れしてるとは言え一発でハマるとは。これからまた引き出し作るのを考えたら、WOODPROに引き出しの箱だけ作るの頼みたくなるw
4:04 Anyone knows what is the name of those orange-coloured device?
I like your tools.....
金属への位置決めをするのに「オートポンチ」を使用してみてはいかがでしょうか。結構便利です。それにしても一発で正確に取り付けできて凄いですね！
ottimo
こんな所ですみません。 以前, パン作りの件で, あまり酸味のあるパンが好きじゃないのであのスターターで作ってると おっしゃてたと覚えてるんですが, レーズンの酵母だと 酸味が出ないのでしょうか？ 私今パン焼きやりはじめて, 普通のサワードゥと, 酸っぱくないようには 市販のイーストを使ってやいてますが, 自家製の酵母で酸味の無いパンが焼ければとおもってます。。( うだうだいわずに,やってみればいいのにね。)
Why did i get so excited when i saw the notifications for this video of him building a kitchen shelf? What’s going on...
いつも思うんですけど、DIYやった後の掃除が大変だろうなって。細かい埃が舞ってブラインドの羽根一枚一枚に積もったりして。（笑）その意味ではおそらくあるバルコニーとか、アウトサイドでやったほうがいいのでは？（大きなお世話でしたw）
Lovely
I would let you do Surgery on me, not kidding.
What he cant do?? Is here something, i dont think...
動画内容とは関係ないですが、壁にかけてあるグレゴリーのバックはなんていうバックでしょうか？かっこよくて気になりました！
nice
COOL!
初めてコメントさせていただきます🎵      いつも動画を楽しみに観させて頂いてます☺️とても気になったのですが、引き出しの枠を作るときに止めているオレンジの工具はどこで購入されたものですか？一人で作業するときに便利で作業がはかどりそうですね🎵
Very talented. Can’t wait to see how the new kitchen turn out.
The music is too loud 😣
I’m the first 😇
I'm really finding your kitchen build boring. Your cooking videos were so good and so calming. I wish you would put that content back up more please and thank you.
りょうやさんこんにちは。今回のＤＩＹにおいて新しく登場する数々の工具の品番など教えて頂けないでしょうか？電動ノコギリや木材の側面に穴をあける工具や引き出しを作る時に使用しているオレンジ色の工具など・・よろしくお願いします。
What is this song? I am liking it a lot. Can someone tell me the title of this song by dj quads.
i subscribed to watch you cook and bake, not build furniture.
A man with a pink drill. Now that's a different level of sexy.
I could watch this guy swab a toilet and it would be interesting
Should be wearing safety glasses when drilling metal
@0:27 - I almost held my breath for good 30 seconds, praying for you. You were leaning on those tiny iron pieces shooting out of the driller. You should have worn safety glasses. Please.
Is there a tool that you DON'T have? You've got everything!
i love the way you work - intelligent and efficient with no wasted movement. but bare feet in the workshop with all those metal shavings? aiiieee.!!!!
Next time you work with metal you should wear shoes and safety glasses. I know this might sound overkill but believe me that any grinding/drilling/forging is somewhat dangerous- coming from a guy who´s had metal removed from his eyes 4 times btw. Still great to see that you make projects like that too :)
Ryoya, you are amazing!
Is there anything you can't do? 😉
A guy that plays the cello, does pottery, cooks wonderfully well, has extraordinary video making and editing skills, is a VEGAN, and on top of that, can build stuff. I am your fan ❤
Every girls dream boyfriend.
Hi, I am from Brasil. I just want to say that your channel it's amazing.
Just because of you and your channel I started to think of become a vegan and now I think that being a vegan is a really awesome option of life and starting now I will try my best.
I don't really know if I can completely change my way of life to become a total vegan, but for now I will start with my food. ♥️
Olá!
Estou no Brasil e gosto muito do conteúdo do seu canal! Por favor comece a cozinhar logo! Kkkkk
Felicidades!
Hello!
I'm in Brazil and I really like the content of your channel! Please start cooking soon! LoL
Cheers!
You should wear an eye mask/goggle when you drill the bigger holes. It’s quite dangerous. Some of the metal pieces might fly into the eyes.
ハンドメイドと名の着くものは何でも出来そうw
逆に出来ない事、やらない事を聞きたいです。
全部一人でやっちゃうって凄いな
Very Very Beautiful
Success 
Good Weekend ...  #dgtudo
早く新居でのレシピ動画見たいなぁ（催促ｗｗｗ
your neighbors should loves you with all the noise.. LMAO
Workshop tools, kitchen gadgets/equipment, awesome!!!  Talented young man!  👍👍👍
リョウヤさん程1日密着してみたいと思った人おらん。
Well done Ryoya! . Perfect tools, perfect skills,.. that's awesome .. thumbs up 😊
You have soo many tools, thats impressive :O
Have you bought them by your own?
This is just amazing! I've been following your cooking channel but man, you're a guy with many talents XD! Keep up the good work and keep us updated! I'm looking forward to seeing the fully finished kitchen :D
HGTv should hire you. ;-)
The walnut counters look even better. But I like the fact that you’re using another lumber for contrast.
You're never going to be able to get all that sawdust and metal shavings cleaned up; it's like glitter! 😂
Just go outside next time
Masterpiece. You tailor made your own kitchen 👍🏻👏🏻
Nice to watch your videos. From Singapore
It's slowly all coming together!! Lovin it my man, never been excited about drawers so much in my life UNTIL NOW! aha
You should wear glasses/ mask or sth to protect your eyes.
リョウヤさん地震は大丈夫でしたか？
これからもお気をつけ下さい。
Beautiful wood, and love the stain colour.😃👍💗
Perfection, detail, beauty.....❤️
Are you carpenter?

Your equipments look professionally
NOGUCHI AND NAKASHIMA WOULD APPROVE.
You had full set of equipments at home like a workshop, it's so cool and great work 👌👍👏👏👏👏
You should take interior design jobs in addition to cooking! I wish i could hire you! Youre SO TALENTED!!!!
すべっての装備は全部持っているものなんですか？ 🤭🤭 すごいですね！
When you are so confident in your masculinity that you aren't afraid to own a pink drill
Your crafts and workmanship is amazing
Loved watching you make your last kitchen, this one is shaping up to be even more beautiful! Awaiting the return of some food videos soon 😀
お腹空いてたせいか、もう少し切り直してるところがパンの耳に見えた。
うん、サンドイッチにしよう。
The edit and video is really good, one small improvement I would do is to reduce the sound of the tools because I was a bit unpleasant to have the tool as loud as they are sometimes in the video :)
This might be intentional since you keep sound hight during your past cooking video, but for me the tools were a bit too agressive to have them that loud 
Otherwise really enjoying your content, awesome videos!
Please wear protective eyewear and footwear!!
Man I love ur videos. Great job!
Wow it's amazing how it's coming out. Keep up the awesome work!!!
Ryoya-san! Please be careful! Please wear shoes and safety goggles :(
I love Japan😍🇯🇵

Ahh - the biscuit joiner.  Wish I'd kept mine now!!  Very nice job Ryoya.
A man who can cook  Vegan food AND use tools! Marry me! 😍
I love your DIY videos (and cooking too). its so satisfying. good work =)
I miss your hands cooking humble meals.
Dude you insist on barefooting whole metalworking. Be careful !
いつも完璧、スムースに作業されるので今日の「どうしようかなぁ」は久々に( *´艸｀)ｸｽｸｽってなりました。でも流石！15cmを４枚取るなんて、私ならもう終わってますね(笑)次の引き出しも楽しみです❗そして最近りょうやさんがお料理されてるとこを見てないのでちょっと恋しいかなぁ～😊
be carefull with your eye, the small pieces of steel when you make a bigger hole 😉
Landlord! My neighbor is sawing wood in the apartment again!😫
I don't know if it was by coincidence or if he's a educated carpenter but this men even glued the boards correctly together always against the annual rings of the each board. Take my Sub
i miss cooking videos,but i guess this will do as well cause it's quality content
Did DIY shelf inside my apartment before. Once finish, cleaning the dust was something and few days with the smells from varnish is another thing..
This is so relaxing. They turned out beautifully.
That's why you measure twice and cut once, lil bro.
You are amazing Ryoya....Is there anything you can't do..? 😁😁👍
I've seen this equipment so many times in your videos now that I'm convinced I really need to know what kind they are from the table to drill bits 😆
Wow man what the heck! Marry me 🙊🙈
丁寧な作り(*´-`)
我が家のカウンターも作ってもらいたい✨
Obviously this video isn't sponsored because of the multiple power tool brands
yeah I need that Makita tool even I never do woodwork
雑誌見ましたよー
掲載おめでとうございます！
this is a real man. can cook, can work, can fly, can fight and can crow!
Love your channel! Don't want to sound naggy but please be careful and wear goggles while drilling, especially metal. A friend of mine hurt his eye because a speck of metal got into his eye. I don't want that to happen to others.
Your videos are kind of relaxing to watch :) and it's awesome that you know how to build things yourself, just the way you need them. Good work!
you inspire me to live a more fulfilling life by being simple <3
Did you took classes, as I've seen you in the pottery ones?
wish I could find me a Handsome and talented Ryoya.
見てるだけで木くずの香りがしてくる〜♡才能だらけで素敵。
I always love this guys videos :3
お疲れ様です＾＾どんどんキッチンが出来上がって来て楽しみですね☆
Hi Ryoya...
Can you make a table with wood and epoxy i bet i would be amazing
Hi Peace Cuisine,

Just curious how do you disinfect and prep the wood before using it as countertop?  Is there any eco-friendly stuff to prevent any antzs, or water resistant to humid weather inside kitchen?  Thanks.
i usualy watch western woodworking DIY video but seeing a japanese making a woodworking DIY video and also making cooking and coffee making video is another thing that picque my interest
Cuisine さんの
いいね！とおっしゃる声がとてもさっぱりしてて私の気持ちまで良くなります！
Love from the PH!!! 🇵🇭
can't wait for the drawer :)
I like that top board. I need more of that stain in my home.
いい色ですね！素敵！
Such a talented man!
チャンネル登録者数150万人おめでとうございます！
工具も色々増えましたね(^^)
りょうやさんのDIYは見ていて本当に楽しい！
Omg, you have all sort of appliances,devices and tools
Ahhh I get so excited to watch his videos!!! <3
家具職人されてたかの如く手際がいいですね。いつも見ていて楽しいです :)
器用すぎてその内平然とマイホーム作り始めそう
Can't wait to see your cooking videos in your new kitchen! :D
やっぱり、りょうやさんのDIY は見ていて良いですねぇ
this is so cool lol i love this channel
Love the background music
I'm curious about what happen to the fine dust from the wood... I hope it doesn't have any...
Genius!!
Bby please wear goggles !!!!
When applying glue to wood you should always cover as much area with the glue as possible. That tabletop is going to break easier now.
I really enjoy watching these, it's rar so see someone really doing this by himself :-)
This was really fascinating
Yay more videos!
りょうやさんの手際の良さに毎回感動‼︎
面倒な作業に変わりはないのに、自分も作りたい！って思わせてくれます。（不器用だから作れないけど！😂）
完成楽しみ！
Dude your videos are always awesome. 👍👍👍👍
どうすればたくさんのことができますか？
あなたは料理以外にも物事を直す！
عمل رائع
Oh god, this Briwax is not food safe man..
りょうやの動画が急上昇に入ってるぞ！w w w
そこら辺の大工さんより道具持ってるんじゃないですか？凄いｗ
Perfect man

自分がやって見たいと思ってたことをりょうやさんが全部実現していくー
羨ましいです
お腹すきました〜料理動画待ってます😌
急上昇10位じゃないですか！！！！！
なにか設計して作るとき、忙しかったりめんどくてたまに木材のカット注文するけどバカ高いから「あれ、サイズ違う」なんてなったら相当頭に来るわ。カメラの前とは言え冷静で凄いｗｗ
what a perfect man
amazing :3
Beautiful ♡
あなたがすごい
First to like my own comment
Charmed to death as always
Get yourself a man who can cook and build stuff at the same time
どこの町工場だよって感じで工具やべぇよマジで🛠
hot handy man!
I come searching for a ramen recipe, now i'm bolting iron fittings...
Iron sole chef.
Looking good.
I miss your food Vids. However, I still love your channel.
00:09 a drill to drill to the heavens
掃除が大変ですね(^◇^;)
ついに手ノコから充電丸ノコになりましたね！大変ですもんね。
Even his voice is so soothing..
日本人て何しても丁寧にしはるなあ。。。
Love your videos
so chillax bro
Can’t wait to see your new kitchen. Good luck and subscribe!
I aspire to be this handy as him... this is really goals
I’m going to widen the hole 🌝
Everything you put hands on is a work of art.
please wear safety glasses please！
Do you own the tools or do you borrow/rent it? :)
loved it !
So master woooooo what should we doooo
wow he got new mechanised saw, an upgrade from the hand saw from his previous diy videos
蕁麻疹的なやつはほとんど治ったんですか？
Awesome to see you work!
You guys have to put up with a LOT of English labelling.  Does it bother you ?
Pdrさんから
To be honest, i prefer your old kitchen, but btw the new one is really clean and nice
袋から出た木がスナックに見えておやつタイムかと思いましたｗ棚の色が綺麗です！
いつもながらオサレ♪♪ DIY 
キッチンが白いから、ブコツナ
木と鉄がはえますね。
カッコエエ(*´∀｀*)
Hey-o!
Briwaxはいい味出ますよね〜ちょっと最初臭いけど。ビスケット使うとか本格的！どんどん進化するのを楽しみにしてます^ ^
Gets my Vote as the most talented person on YouTube!
When does the new video come for a new recipe
Hello 👋
doing this in such cramped space is nice...
Im hungry
cool
ご自身で作れるの、素敵だな〜。
板と板ってこうやってくっつけるんですね。
DIY動画サイコー。何回見ても飽きません。
Hi.
こうゆう方が芸能人のヒロミさんの
技とか見たら
どう思うのかなぁ( ＞Д＜；)
Safety glasses!
Safety glasses!
Cool
この方の動画を長い間視聴している人に質問です。この方は何者ですか？
終わった後の掃除はどうされてるのですか？
いつも楽しみにしてまーす
道具はレンタルですか？
You gotta butter your biscuits.
Good morning/afternoon/evening Ryoya san, I was wondering that maybe you could do a recipe for the tofu-misozuke once the kitchen is set up? Everyone who's tried it loved it... I've never tried and there is no chance I could find it (in Europe)... Have a nice day!!!
♥In love!♥
You are perfect!
Kisses from Brasil!
Do you have a Dairy-free dessert recipe? im dairy intolerant so i would like to try ur vegan recipes but...i can eat egg so if possible, can you make a dairy-free recipe?
Yay!!!
平和な木工？ 👍❤️
Making the holes bigger without safety glasses, brave brave soul
second
You could be painting a white wall with white paint and I’d still watch the video
The more I watch his videos, the more i find him really attractive
Seeing this man work satisfies my inner aesthete.
Ryoya please, stop making us guys look bad 😂
I want my sons to be like this young man: self reliant, hard working & kind natured. Thanks for your videos!
Seriously is there something you are not good at??? Amazing work! Looking forward to seeing you back in your cooking videos 😊
音楽うるさいかな？
Is music a little bit too loud?
Hello Ryoya! You seem a Jack-of-all-trades guy! Cheers to 🇯🇵 from 🇩🇪❗❗
How is there not sawdust everywhere in that kitchen?
So handy! I wouldn't even know where to start with a project like this 😂 Looking like it's all coming together! 👍
Seriously how do you know what to do? Do you take classes? I can't even hang a frame photo properly without leaving too many holes in my walls.
Could you do a "what I eat in a day" video when you're kitchen is complete?
In Japan, you can rent tools for hours or a day to take with you home or use them in the shop. Which is a great system every country should have. There are also DIV corners, where you can use the tool in the shop with help of assistant as well as classes on how to use tools for projects.
When I look at all you do, I think of an American by the name of William Coperthwaite.  He wrote a book entitled, "A Handmade Life".   He was peaceful too.  Both of you are inspiring.  Thank you for sharing your life and work.
Muito Show!!!!   Os vídeo ficarão cada vez melhores! 
Saudades dos seus vídeos! 
Abraços. . . Bom Final de Semana!  #dgtudo
You look a lot more muscular!
その作業家の中でやるのやめてくれよ(´･×･`)
I hate when the diy videos end lol
Ryoya is like Casey Neistat of Kitchen.
Discovered you only a few days ago but your videos on this channel (and your 2nd channel) is officially my way to relax and chill.
it's coming together nicely ....i'm inspired I love that you're doing it yourself! You continue to inspire my channel! Can't wait for it to be up in actions. Thanks for the video!
Kobanwa Ryoya  San 🙂 (hope this is correct way to say Good evening to Mr Ryoya :) )
Your glazing video was the first video that I watched which led to all the other cooking videos and this one.  
You are always working on your own which is very inspiring ! 
Hope there are people to help you in the making. 
Cheers to that charming smile you hold :) 
To more peaceful cuisine 😊
Watashi wa Sandhya desu. 
Mata aimashou.
初めまして。デンマーク在住です。いつも楽しく観させていただいてます。
ナット締め、とても勉強になりました！
黒テープで巻くと何度も確認したり、誤って奥深くまでにならないですよね。
日本ではDIYやったことが一切無いのに、
居住地は高税金で人件費も高額なので、DIYも自分でやるのが普通で、
不器用な私はいつも四苦八苦しています（笑）

毎回一発でキレイな仕上がりになり素晴らしいですね！
seriously how do you manage all these and still so good at cooking .. and like is there anything you are not good at 😂
穴を開けるときは太い方で何ミリか開けた後に細い経で深く削った方が綺麗に仕上がりますよ
Yeeeees!!待ってました😆😆DIYのビデオいつも楽しく見ています！You’re seriously talented! Is there anything you can’t do?!?! Lol!!次のビデオ(明日かな？)楽しみにしています😊😊
外でやる訳にもいかないでしょうけど、綺麗なキッチンでやすり掛け、後が大変ではなかったですか？笑
Please show us wild, wild Kyoto with its kaiseki cuisine that The Wall Street Journal wrote about. Thanks 💖
Αλβανικό μαύρισμα ο ψηλός !
(Greek joke about tanning lines on arms ) 
Nice job
Perfec! Perfect my friend! 
Success, always! 
Good Weekend... Hugs.  #dgtudo
珍しく更新が早い‼︎
Ryoya, I've got to say that you're one of my favorite youtubers.

However, I'm surprised that you're not using some Japanese hand planes.
They are very meditative to use, and result in excellent results...particularly the chamfer plane.

I'm also seriously tempted to send you an Opinel pocketknife.
It seems like the thing that you'd really like (but it's French, not American)
I have a visual.
Give me a chance.
Please post more ASMR cooking vids! Been waiting for it for ages now 😁 

Much love from PH 🇵🇭
Side note. The light reflecting off the hex key as you screwed in the anchors to your walnut table top was really perfect. That bodes well for your future videos.
Such a hard working man wow great job !!!
自分でやったら愛着もわいて生活が楽しくなりますね。こんなハイセンスなものなかなか売っていないし笑笑
サイズも自由ですしね！
こういう作業系大好き。手さばきというのでしょうか？身のこなしもそつなくて、素敵です。。
真似してやったら大失敗する自信がある
ペンのヘッドが好きだなぁ😁
I love your DIY video... really interesting
I loved everything about this. You're really cute. But also seem like the perfect husband.
I would intentionally break everything in my house just so i could watch him fix it.
お疲れ様です😊
りょーやさんの動画は料理もDIYもいつも丁寧な作業だから、
ずーっと見てられます👍
根気のいる作業なのに淡々と続けられてて凄い！性格かなぁ？( *´艸｀)
ウォールナット、とっても良い感じ！実際の質感はまた良いんでしょうね！続き頑張って下さい😊
It's just mind blowing ... how one person can be excellent in so many completely different projects... Ryoya  you are a source of constant inspiration and surprise...
Looking great, love the progression. Nice tan also  :D
I just realized you've uploaded new videos and remember watching them before coming to japan. I'm loving this series and catching up on the vids I've missed. Keep it up and honestly, the space looks amazing. Nice job.
最近のりょうやさんの動画、活き活きしてて、素敵！
京都への引越し、大正解でしたねー。
DIY待ってましたーーー👏
毎回真剣に見てしまう
2:54 ロボットのシャーペン可愛い…🤖
Never knew someone like this does exist 😂
Freaking productive ma shaa Allah 😻
The chancla tanline on his feet made me laugh that’s such a summer #mood

I’m so happy for him and I’m always so mesmerized by the work he does. I hope he never stops being so creative ❤️❤️
Your kitchen is coming along beautifully❤️
Beautiful! Thanks for the videos! So inspiring! 👍🏼💕
早送りの所ヤカンの音みたい(笑)
Seriously Ryoya you are the “Jack of all trades!” Your videos have motivated me beyond measure. I started riding my bike to work and I began working on small projects. Thanks for the continued inspiration!!! Greetings from NYC..✌🏼💜🙌🏼🌱🎶🥗
You're so methodical about everything you do, the cooking, the diy, the videos - I think there is a lot of peace in you, which is something I totally envy you. All the best with all your endeavours, I'll keep watching :) greetings from Poland :)
腕、日焼け凄いですね
外で何か作業したんですか？
綾也さん本当に憧れます... 弟子入りしたい！笑
What type of sanding paper was it? Fine or coarse? I want to do a similar project. Thank you! Also great video and may I suggest a no music video? Just like your cooking ones?
楽しそう🎵
掃除機隊でいいのでお手伝いしたいです(笑)
Just realized your crazy tan, haha! Table tops look amazing, looking forward to more :D
I wouldn't mind watching this whole thing in normal speed. I love your diys and I aspire to do them myself one day.
Your place looks beautiful TT^TT I wish I could find a place like that in TX.  Breathtaking
ryoya is teaching us about wood ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Great work. Was wondering about the progress on your kitchen. Coming along really nice
腕いい感じに焼けてますね〜！
半袖焼けがくっきり😁
I really love how you being precise with every single thing you do... you really inspire me a lot
Tan lines... Hahaha... 
Anyway, I just wanna say you really have an eye for precision and lots of patience. Keep it up.
Always inspiring me to get up and create. Now if only I could be as organized as this man I'd be getting somewhere. Can't wait for the kitchen to be ready for new cooking vids. :)
けっこう根気がいる作業だと思います。
室内でのサンダがけの時には念のためコンセント穴塞いでおいた方が良いですよ！
キッチンが近い所でのサンダがけ大丈夫でしたか？お掃除大変だったんじゃ…
次も楽しみです！
週末の癒しです
0:50 RIP headphone user
Beeswax isn't vegan though 💔
Man your quality craftmanship with everything you do.
how do sand furniture indoors and manage to keep your surfaces clean??
OMGoodness - the tops look amazing!  Love this videos and seeing the kitchen build from OK to Fantastic!!
High key hope my future husband can do it all like you...because GEEZ.
肩のボリュームが増したような。
whenever im stressed, i'll binge watch ryoya videos.
It’s coming along very nicely. Good work!
Gosh.  You're making my standards way up high 👆
You are an inspiration. DIY master. Bravo!
Beautiful ... like always honeys from Chile Ryoya
植物油ベースの自然塗料オスモカラーのウォルナットもおすすめです。
Ryoya, would you use Hinoki wood as well for the tops? This really looks great by the way.
You have sunburn on your arm :) that show you traveled a lot
ALSO PLS WEAR GOGGLES TOO
So you are not vegan, after all.
Really like your recent videos, it's cool to see your new place coming together and the places you're visiting around Kyoto ^_^
They look great and I love the concrete walls. You are a man of many talents.
I have a door that needs to be hinged properly and my garden gate needs fixing, lol...just saying ;) Your kitchen is going to look amazing when it's finished! Very sleek! I use Briwax for my wood...it's a mixture of Beeswax and Carnauba.
Invest in hex bits for your drill. Makes life so easy.
屋内、しかもこんな綺麗な部屋、キッチンでサンダーかけるのに全く養生してないなんて。。。笑
Could I ask what are the nails on the first 2 boards for (include the one he broke, love it tho!), please anyone with the answer out there?!
I don't know why, but your videos are always oddly satisfying to watch
i need a small table to work on in my room, seeing you makes me wanna build my own!
Hello from Israel
Love your videos!
We need another Q & A RYOYA
日焼けのあと…!!!!!!
色白さん…!!!!!!(見るところが違う)
3:00 even drawing some markings can make him look sexy 😂and his tan lines
変わらず仕事が丁寧で、自分のDIYの雑さを痛感するわ～💦
削るのが厄介そうな板をどんな風に仕上げるのか楽しみ♪
Looking good!! Can't wait to see your new cooking vids!!!
His arms & hands are beautiful
古材の荒々しい天板もかっちょいいですが
アイアンフレーム+ワックス仕立てのウォルナット天板に萌えない男子は居ないですね(笑
集成材の界面のラインも自分は好きだったりします😁
いやー最高にカッコ良いです
2 table tops look great
he's literally perfect 😭
Tシャツ焼けがすごい
Charming
The kind of guy I need, can cook and very handy 😛
The walnut countertops turned out very nice :)
You're AMAZING! ❤❤❤😁
I just want to say I love your freaking videos and never stop making them!
最後の笑顔がウキウキしてる笑
ところでパボーニ ちゃんはどこへ行ったのでしょうか？
Hi Ryoya, could I know the name of beeswax you used ? Is it organic and safe for cut board ?
日焼けあとがすごい😂
いい色に仕上がりましたね
ワクワクする😊
今後が楽しみ♬

京野菜紹介して下さい
美味しい食べ方とか
お願いします
Next time use glove, safety first 😀
この手際の良さよ。。。
so friggin efficient...
YES YOURE BACK
Man, I love this.
待ってました！！DIY動画！最高です！！
ウォルナット最高！うちもウォルナット派。
次の動画ワクワクします。楽しみ〜
個人的に、料理動画よりDIY動画が好きw
Like that pink power drill
日焼けてるw
why you are so long not making cooking video! im waitin for that!!!
出来上がりが凄くいいですね☆自分で何でも作ってしまうなんてさすがです＾＾
Im always inspired to do more creative things by just watching Ryoya 😊 cant wait to see on how the kitchen's gonna look like!
Notice me, senpai!
💪👏💪👏💪🤗
🍉🌵🌶
楽しい^_^
8:50 the weird sun marks are real and a struggle
俯瞰撮影が好きです
0:50 RIP earphone users
Looks amazing! Great work!
おうちの中で、やすり。
沢山、粉っぽくなりそう～と思いながら見ていました。
完成品が素晴らしいですね。
ただただ、感動です✨
鬼目ナットに木工用ボンドって初めて見ました。メーカーサイトで調べてみたら推奨されていました。
Be it for a man or a woman, being a handy person like Ryoya is goals! :D
Yaaaasssss new video! And it's DIY!
パート 3おたのしみにしてます！
I miss your no talking asmr 😔
i hope you have earplugs in that I can't see. Using a sander indoors without hearing protection is a surefire way to get tinnitus D:
What is the song specifically???
Love this video. I’d like to see a video like this without the music though. I watch your cooking videos without music when I can’t sleep. Maybe next time?
I aspire to become an adult like you ~
COOKINGGANGSTER!!!!!!!!!
すごい、マメですね！！！お料理もすごいな〜と拝見してましたが、、、
why does the wall have holes? anyways it's a beautiful place!
Rip headset users 😂😂😂
Nice farmer’s tan... but honestly, not only are you an amazing chef, but an excellent craftsman as well. Is there anything you can’t do??
サンダル焼けしてますね(笑)
ビーサン焼けしてますね！夏を満喫してそう〜🌞
Yay he's back☺
That's a serious farmers tan 😄
He doesn’t need ad revenue! Lol. Another great video!
Looking good!
This video is perfection
Like your videos start cooking pls
0:50 歯医者でしかなかった。
Little robot pen close up haha
やっぱりりょーやさんは鬼目にした！(^^) このワックスは水拭きできるんすかね？ウォールナットは間違いないですね〜。私は予算が厳しかったのでオーク材にしました。私もマルトクさんで買いましたよ。あとは根性でハンドやすいがけ。
James Bond also remodels kitchens.
0:49 That scared the shit out of me LOL
Can’t wait to see your finished kitchen. You are doing good.
Ryoyaさん、”私の記憶が正しければ～～”、そのナットの次がワッシャーで、次が例のアイアンシェフの穴で、そこにボルトをねじ込んで接続するのじゃなっかったでしたっけ？そうすると、その面は天板の裏側ですよね？その面にも丁寧に保護剤ぬって、、、丁寧ですね。
りょうやさん、いつも音楽どうやって探してますか？😊

People in Asia know how to do everything, man.

My cousins in the Philippines are impressive.  I've seen them weld things, do carpentry, tile a floor, upholstery, I have a cousin who can sew an entire room-set of curtains in a day with matching bed linens, and her dad used to sew his own 3-piece suit.

And they do it non-chalantly.  Like if I could do the shit they do - just one- I would have a press release or something m lol.

I did however learn a. few things from our grandmother: she showed me how to love cooking and gardening and she taught me some home economics stuff like canning and making jams from fruits grown backyard instead of letting them rot.  So thanks lola!
私も色はウォルナットが好きです！
落ち着きますよね！
地道な作業もコツコツとするし、男性なのにとても丁寧な暮らしをされてるのが大好き！
9:35 those tan lines
Beautiful!
Beautiful!
Love from India 🇮🇳. Please Don’t ignore my question , Why you focused on ‘VEGAN’ foods ?
Hi Ryoya, u r man of my dreams. Don't get offended but had to say... u look hot in that maroon tee...lol. Take care.
トレンド入り㊗️
Good information but disappointing about the promotion of beeswax. Honey and beeswax isn't considered vegan, and look how many people in the comments are now looking to buy after watching it... :(
can u make mashed potato and use many mushroom pls
うるさくなーい
リョーヤさん返信して！
関西でオフ会して！
👍👍👍👍
I can not wait to see your video in this new it on kitchen....post soon please
この曲名はなんでしょう？What's this music？
1st
やはりビーワックスに引っかかる人はいるんだなぁ。動物製品は生産過程で苦しみや痛みがあり、植物は苦しみがなく犠牲も少ないとの考えだと思うけど、本来のveganの理念って動物保護や愛護ではなく、生物の共存を目指していくものだと私は思います。
 動物や虫にしか創造できない「物」を借りて生活することは逆に真のveganなのではないかと。。
Ryoya Where did you buy the cutting board with tree bark?
外で作業すればいいのに
love seeing your kitchen DIY you're so creative from food to pottery to woodworking to photography and videography and then cooking on top of that OH and Music too  Can I import you ? I really need myself a Ryoya in my life !
WHERE ARE YOUR GOGGLES SAFETY FIRST
Beeswax isn't vegan, right?
Excellent!
Note to self: girl get you a man who can do it all.
So no ones going to make a hitachi magic wand joke? ok, cool...
I love your videos and recipes but watching you sand against the grain of that wood makes me sad, you will get a much better finish if your strokes go along the grain instead of against T.T though using a sander like that will give you little swirl marks no matter what direction you sand so perhaps you knew that. Also please protect your feet when working! I would hate to hear that you got hurt because a countertop fell on your feet.
部屋の中で電動サンダかけると掃除大変じゃなかったですか？
自分はこの前やってすごく後悔しましたw
Awesome work
I really want his patient to be able to do all of that by himself
2こめ
Look forward for tomorrow! Get some rest!
i like ....legal
I don't understand how the nuts helped fix the boards to the iron frames
僕は自宅にガレージがあるので、アイアンのテーブル等を作るときも溶接からやっちゃいます。
足場板の表面は切りっぱなしの荒材と同じなので、削るとなると自動カンナか電動の手カンナがないのかなり苦労しますし室内がものすごく散らかります。知り合いに工務店があればお願いして表面を削って貰うという方法もありますね。
Hi..first of all, I looooove watching your video! i was trying to make the blueberry cake.. I got all the ingredients, but when I try to blend the base with my ninja blender. I guess it has no enough liquid or too hard, it won’t blend well.. this is a bit upsetting. I see you use Vitamix, which is over my budget. Is there any blender around $100 budget you would recommend using for a beginner? Does it have to have purée function? Thanks a lot!!
Ryoya君にしてはサンダー掛けするのに養生テープしなくて大丈夫だったの？ダストパック付きとは言え粉塵は？
そういえば引っ越してからコンポストはどうなったんでしょうか？
Guys I love this channel too but some of you are WAY too impressed by a guy adding some threaded inserts to a benchtop.
Awesome video.
ワックス塗ったらめっちゃイイ感じになった(*´▽｀*)機械の音近所迷惑にならないんですか？ｗってめっちゃ腕日焼けしてるじゃないですかｗ
Great Ryoya.! ,😀
What the hell can't you do?
Maybe it's not savoury to ask, but how are you earning a living while renovating? Or for that matter, are you at all?
Am i the only one that doesn’t understand the screws? How does it attach to the metal frame?
この感じで、評価してるやつの気が知れんwww

Hi Ryoya, can you please let me know what model is your Hitachi drill? Thank you

りょーやさんはじめまして
チャンネル登録７年目にして初コメです。
最近の猛暑、地震、豪雨と続き、投稿がしばらくなかったので心配していました。
しかし今回の動画で、相変わらずアクティブな姿にホットしました。引き続きお体に気をつけてください。これからもワクワクする動画、楽しみにしています。
Hello Ryoya: I like your YT-channel very much... but I am missing your wonderful cooking videos! When will you post your next recipe? Cheers from 🇩🇪 to 🇯🇵
You seem so calm and laid back. I like videos like this.
初コメという幸せを初めて噛みしめてます、祝ってください

りょーやさんこんばんは！
京都の生活には慣れてきましたか？
キッチンのレイアウト、着々とできていきますねー😊
私としては早く料理動画が見たいんだけどな( *´艸｀)
自分で使い勝手の良い空間にしていくのって楽しいですよね！
毎日暑いですが(京都は特に！)ご自愛下さいませ😊
キッチンの完成が楽しみです❣️

The music you use is so cool. Love that it samples Artie Shaw's Frenesi!
I was thinking about your new apartment recently. Nice layout and the wood tops are beautiful against the industrial walls. Looking forward to many videos filmed in this kitchen. Good luck!
Love your updates. What a stylish life you lead!
Insert nut ( ͡° ͜･･ ͡° )


I'm sorry
Yay! When does the next season start? :)
I love your videos ! And the ending music , could anyone tell me the name of the music ? Thanks a lot
いつ見てもカッコイイ！
リョーヤさんのDIY見るの凄く
大好きです！
待ってた！！  やっぱりりょうやの動画はオモシレー！
自分で考えて形に出来るって本当に凄いです、センスも問われるしかっこいいなーていつも拝見してます！
少し疑問だったのですが冷蔵庫の横にピッタリと配置してるように見えるのですが隙間を空けなくて大丈夫なんですか？
久しぶりの動画、、、待ってましたぁああああああ😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Curious to know what fridge is that.
見たかったやつです！！
I miss your old kitchen. but ... i crave to see this new kitchen ☘
I really like your channel! Please do not stay too long without posting new videos! 👏🤓
楽しみが、始まる！

The kitchens coming along great, Ryoya!
引き出し部分をどのように作るのか気になる〜
watching this video as the summer breeze hits me :)
LOVE the editing of this video!
Ryoya is back! Cant wait to see next eps :)
Welcome back!!!!
You have an entire floor for a kitchen, nicee :D
Missed you bro 😢
どんどん完成していくのが楽しみです。頑張ってください！
縦長の部屋は狭く見えますけど、実際は結構広いんですよ。
このキッチンの完成が楽しみです✨
Hi Ryo, no need to screw the table top, let it be.
I think the weight of the wooden table top itself is sufficient to maintain it in place.
おしゃれでカッコいい！！
でもおいらには手が出ないお値段( ；∀；)
Glad your back!
りょーやさん！
相変わらずかっこいいですね！
掘れた(笑)
Your videos are always a surprise - love how we are invited to watch the transformations in your home!  Now I can't wait to see the first meal cooked in there!!
Ambitious! You the man!
I love that you share with us. Its like we are building it with you.
Noooo I need more content!!!
Will be waiting for your next video!
カメラワークがくるくる回るので酔った…(>_<)
Beeswax? 😢
Lovely to see you -- it's been a while!
Looking forward to your next video..:-)
很開心看到你的新影片(ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ
一直以來都非常期待你的新廚房(｡◕∀◕｡)
(`･∀･)nice to see your new video~
Love you space so much!!!
Everyone saying welcome back, he didn't go anywhere, check his second channel he has uploaded more videos there!
いつも使われてるカッターナイフを教えてください。
かっこいいですよね。
待ってましたーーー！！！
あなたのキッチン全体をアクセスしやすいようにするのはいいことです。木を愛し、冷蔵庫は冷静です。😍👍
we missed u!!
相変わらずお洒落でセンスが良いですね＾＾私も綾也さんみたいなお部屋にしたいです♡
貴方の料理動画が心地よくて寝る前に見てます。
もう1つ真ん中にテーブル来たら……結構狭くなったゃわないですか、キッチン…。

にしてもオシャレなお家ですね、憧れます！
3:54 HE'S SO FANCY, he buys evian AND Pellegrino???
I'd missed you 😢😢
Happy to see your video :D
So glad to see that this is "ep.1". Cant wait for more.
色は塗ってあるのかな？塗らないと錆びて赤くなってきますよ
Notife squad!! Please do no music videos
ryoyaさんのほうの動画(vlog?)みてたので、久しぶりに感じなかったですよ〜！

相変わらずのdiy系動画、楽しんでます。
待ってました…
No storage space...yet still very good looking👍
鬼目ナットしない方に3000点ｗ
you are so inspiring!!
もうもう😉待ってましたよ😍落ち込んでたから
とても嬉しい動画でした
Watching you put your kitchen together is so aesthetically pleasing.
実用的且つお洒落！
I'm excited to see how the kitchen turns out!
久々の動画アップ嬉しい✨
Are you leaving the bins out?  I normally like them hidden/put away, not that it's any of my business lol
I miss the cooking videos T.T
動画短いよー
もっと長くしてよぅー
Can’t wait to see the finished product!
Long time no see!
Hi Ryoya 🙂
I love your voice
うーむ、冷蔵庫の前が窮屈ですな。
前から感じておりましたが、正直な感想としてちょっと狭くないですか・・？
We missed you
冷蔵庫は何処のブランドですか？
Peaceful furniture
いいなぁなんだか楽しそう👍👍👍
I mean... it’s not really DIY if you just ordered both parts.
わーーー！
ついにキッチン来た
もっとビデオ📹 つくってください〜！！
THOSE MANGOS
白い床良いなぁ〜
本当そのセンスほしいわ
finally u are back wiii wiiiii!! :)
You're back! Yay!
His life is so fresh & clean
After a long time
手作りっていいよね。。
Ur voice is so cutee
Welcome back.
Hi, Ryoya :)   What kind of watch are you wearing in this video?   And is it possible to see how  your whole house looks like from outside? Thank you )
So happy to see you back on youtube!
9th comment
Can I ask what are those red, yellow, blue trash bins designated for?
Finally!
おしゃれやー
マンゴーうまそー
その後、お肌の調子はいかが？やはり自然環境の影響は大きいのでしょうね。
はじめして。時計は何を使われていますか？
Nice 🤗
😊
Thumbs up
冷蔵庫の調子どうですかー？
Awesome! ^_^
I feel like the kitchen will not have any walking space with an island D: but it does look amazing!
更新がいつかいつかと楽しみにしてました！
しかし、新居もどんどんお洒落になっていきますね😳
Hello Ryoya!
Where did you buy your cutting board with tree bark? I see her in many of your videos and it's beautiful! Congratulations for your new home!
りょうやさんこんにちは。いつもりょうやさんの後追いをして同じ物を買っています（＾-＾）ワークテーブルも同じ物を買ったんですけど、若干ですが天板の節にえぐれがあったり、となりの木材と段差があったりして妥協できるレベルではあるんですけど、以前りょうやさんがセイロを購入された時におっしゃられていたように、もう少しなんとかならないのかなって思ってしまいました。愚痴ってすいません（＾＾；古材なので仕方ないですよね（＾-＾）スツールは結局オーク材の物を買いました(*- -)(*_ _)ペコリ　動画の更新楽しみにしています（＾-＾）
本当にりょーやさんはご自分の理想を追求して実現できていらっしゃるので凄いです☺️
ご自分のペースで無理なく京都を満喫しつつ頑張ってください😌
天板はどこで購入されましたか？
Just out of curiosity, why do you mostly buy DIY furnitures? Do you enjoy making them? Thanks!
Even peaceful moving, this guy is so collected
Lovely place and look forward to watching you make it home and to the new food videos!
Is there anything you can't DO? Videographer, chef, DIY, apron designer, kitchen designer....
Wow, Ryoya your new place looks so beautiful.
I'll miss the old place. It was so comforting and cool. Hope this one will be too. Congratulations.
wow such a beautiful spot you moved into!! so much natural light, it is a artist's heaven haha.
Looks like an amazing space! Can't wait to see how it changes along the way
Hello and thanks for uploading your move and share it to us!!! It looks very nice and spacious place. I can not wait to know how everything will be furnished.  Good luck and until then.
I'm so happy you're uploading again!
Glad everything is going smoothly so far and you arrived at your new place safely. Excited to see what you're going to do with the new space and all the new things you'll be working on. Bet it's going to be awesome! 😊Remember to take care of yourself. lol you're always working so hard. 💜
京都へ引っ越してこられたんですね！歓迎します！
京都はお寺が多くて、精進料理に使う食材も、京野菜もあるのでビーガンの料理をするには結構恵まれた土地ですよ。
外食系なら「びお亭」さんや「Apprivoiser」さんや「ファラフェルガーデン」さんが、私のお勧めです。
あと、観光や在住の外国の方も多いので、外国の方との交流とかもしやすいです。
隣の滋賀県で琵琶湖1周サイクリングとかもできますしね(^-^)
11月の「ビーガングルメ祭り京都」とかで会えたら良いな。
人の家なのに、この先どうなるかワクワクします！楽しみにしてまーす！
階段折れそう(　ﾟдﾟ)
りょうやさんが京都に！
関西へようこそ！！！
おしゃれにDIYせずとも、モダンなインテリアの場所へ引っ越したのね～！
しかも防音が効いてるような(*´-`)
ここから生み出されるレシピをまた楽しみにしてます。
あ、チェロのお披露目も(笑)
:O I love the new place. I've been planning to build/buy my own home too and its something similar to that :D I LOVE high ceilings. The floor space looks around 25-30sqm? (1st floor and 2nd floor each) land is very expensive here so I'm planning to build a tall house <3
明るくて、DIYをやり易そうな感じの新居ですね。
京都を選んだのはどうしてですか？
鳥のように自由ですね
まさかの京都ですか笑
ふらっと自由でほんとりょうやさんらしいです
これからも動画楽しみにしてます!!
京野菜を使った料理が見たいな
家具DIY好きからしたら、色々リセットで寂しかったけどこれからまた何か作ってくれそうでワクワクすぎる。
なんだか寂しいけど、執着していないりょうやさんを見ると安心します
Fabulous new place ! Can’t wait to see how you decorate it ! Wow , three floors ! You have worked very hard and certainly deserve it ! Well done my friend 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💐
Magnifique plan de travail !
New space looks heavenly peaceful
So nice... 😍
京都へいらっしゃるとは
ماشاءالله مبدع👌👌،، مبروك البيت الجديد 💛💛
your new house looks absolutely amazing! Lovely natural light! best wishes! I cannot wait to see the new recipes coming <3
京都へようこそ！会えるかな～
オシャレですよね〜

お家賃聞きたいですが無理ですよね(*´ 艸｀)
京都民大歓喜です😆京大の近くはヴィーガンのご飯屋さんも何軒かあって外食も充実ですよ
前のキッチン作る過程動画で見たたので、もったいないって思っちゃうけど、器用なりょうやさんならすぐまた新しく作れちゃうんでしょうね。＾＾京都でつくる動画楽しみにしてます。
Que seja feliz em New York.
Sucesso!
Congratulations! It's always a joy to see my favorite youtubers succeed.
The place look so artistic however in my own opinion i like the old one but then again every person needs a new change of pace. Looking forward for the new setup!
You have a roof! Can't wait to see what you make of the place. Take care! =D
Me: moves to a new house. Takes all the things from the previous one.
Ryoya: moves to a new house. FREAKING BUYS EVERYTHING NEW.
おしゃれ！ 空調大変そう！
引越しも運転もお疲れさまでした！
今回もオシャレなお宅になりそう…
関西へいらっしゃーい❤京都は冬がとても寒いのでコンクリートのお家は寒そうですー😱😧
引っ越し先が京都とは思いませんでした。新しくなったキッチンでの動画楽しみにしてます😊
Lindo ! muito sucesso sempre, parabéns!
コンクリートの壁、お洒落な貴方様にお似合い☺️
でも多分お家に換気扇が沢山ないと、家中の物がカビだらけになります。
靴も洋服、バックまで、カビがすごかったです。😓
食品の粉類も目になかなか見えませんが、カビが発生しやすいので注意してくださーい😊
素敵な手作りキッチン期待しております。🤗
すごい体力だあ〜😅ハワイから帰ってすぐでしたよね。京都はとても素晴らしい所なので選ばれたのでしょうか？新しい暮らしの動画楽しみにしております👍
I love your peaceful, humble, and creative personality. Well reflected in your space, cooking, and videos. You are an inspiration.
おっしゃれー！！
これからDIYで家具が増えていくの楽しみ＾＾
beautiful place wishing you good vibes in new place💯😊
Woooow I really like the new place 😍😍 it's bigger and it feels more modern in the middle of Kyoto 😎
I liked the old place, but this new studio looks very promising too. :D

とてもオシャレな物件ですね
コンクリート打ちっぱなしの物件は夏蓄熱して暑くて、冬コンクリートが冷えて寒いんですよね。
吹き抜けも開放的で良いんですが、思いのほか冷暖房効率が悪く暑くて寒いんですよね。
これから先DIYで、お部屋がまた素敵に変化していくのがとても楽しみです。(^_^)
I wish you luck and happiness in your new home. I know how stressful and tiring it can be to move.
Wow ! Nice place ! I'm gonna take your old place 😂😂. "I live where Peaceful cuisine LIVED !!" 😂
Bon courage ! 😊

So excited to see the new place! Patiently waiting for more updates!

You will should visit Li zi qi and her garden☺ love from Turkey ❤
looking forward to seeing it when it incompletely finisher.
"Insert nuts to assemble legs" lmao 😂💀
Wow what a beautiful space! Kind of looks like something Tadao Ando would design with all that exposed concrete. So cool!
Not sure how to feel about the concrete walls, but I'm sure Ryoya will make them look good!!
I'm excited for your new kitchen! 🙂
屋上をちゃんとみてみたい！
Please do a video on how you exercise. Thankful😄

Un saludo desde Colombia. Si es hermosa la casa,  sólo Colca algunas plantas🌱 para darle un toque acogedor.
Ooohhh new fancy place! In japan this is like a mansion size almost
So exciting to watch you go from one space to another. ❤️
I love Kyoto! My Japanese friends live in Otsu by lake Biwa, so I always go through Kyoto. I love how it is a big city, yet can still feel like a village. Good luck moving I am moving this upcoming weekend. :o)
いらっしゃいませ京都へ！！
Subarashii desu ne :D  I haven't really used Japanese since my student exchange 15 years ago... but I kind of understand what you are saying. Addicted to your videos now!
Just saw this! So happy for you, it's a nice place. Well designed!
i'm binge watching your videos yet again :')
It's awesome, very modern.♥️
優しい声がだいすきです
Looks good! Congrats on a new place :)
Sugoii. Love your new studio!!
Amazing place. Good ideas for when I move.
It looks smaller than your old place just spread out over three floors? I can see the potential, concrete walls are a bit odd. :)
Wow, you make looks so easy this big project. Congratulations in your new studio.
Great place! I love your blogs! 💕
Stairs are noisy but in a comforting and inviting way! The bathroom would make me feel crazy if I lived there because of the little tiles lol
お金持ちだなあ。。
I will miss your old setup of kitchen :(
Update us on your new living space!
Yeahhh Thanks for update in this morningg 😁
The stairs triggers me. Looks so thin. :(
キッチンツアーが楽しみ！
Many blessings to your new home Ryoya 🙏
I just binged watching his videos for hours, for real tho these pictures are so beautiful. The colors, angles, noises and editing are well blended together. I bet he can make a cutting 🍅 video million views😂.
holy shit. for a moment i read the video title as "new studio & new york table" thought u had moved to NY and i was very excited for a brief second.
Congratulation! Can't wait for your new video. 😀
1ヶ月ほど前 三条通を歩いてらっしゃるのを見かけました。まさか京都にお引越とは。
Hello. I hope you are doing well. I like your esthetic and the way how simple you see things! I am looking forward until your fridge arrives ! Take care, lots of love

beautiful place! can't wait for more videos of you furnishing it and unpacking. i didn't quite get where you'll have your bedroom though. good luck!
洗練されてるなぁ、いろいろと。
✌👍❤エジプトから見ています👍
素晴らしい👍❤💛💚💙💙💖
What's going on with the walls,  do you have to paint them,  look strange
Well done Ryoya it looks amazing and you are amazing hard-working  person!
Watching you do ANYTHING is interesting
Congratulations!!!! Gorgeous Modern Space!
京都！！みんなが理由を知りたい！
リョーヤくん、久々に質問コーナーを！！！
Hope to see you make DIY furniture. Congarts for your new house, Ryoya san. Lovely ! ^^
I am eager to see what you'll cook for us next in this nice place. 😊
Welcome to Kyoto! I’m jealous of your awesome new place.
執着のない様が清々しい
こんにちは
Gorgeous table, congratulations on the new studio. Love and hugs.
i think u should buy your own new house , so u can make your kitchen  there forever.
You truly are an amazing human being 😊 your energy is calming indeed. I'm so happy to have found your channel. Far too many cooks make ridiculous noise either through shouting or banging pots n pans. If only they took a leaf out of your book 😌 I discovered you when searching for samosas recipe, I've subscribed since that day. Wishing you greatness ❣
Ryoya, it's a beautiful kitchen n home. Looking forward to see more cooking videos from your new workspace soon.
Lovely place but you live alone bro?
朝から りょうやさん見て目の保養になりました(*´∇｀*)ありがとうございます⭐️笑

京都に住まわれるのですね！
おうちもスタイリッシュでオシャレな感じですね！
素敵でーす！
Look at the concrete walls in your new space! I wonder how your cello will sound. Some soundproofing to dampen the echo may be good. I think it will sound beautiful. I'm looking forward to hearing your music in this new room.
Ayyy new peaceful kitchen 😁😁 looks nice
I’m so glad to see you doing so well, I’ve been subscribed since 2012 when I became a vegan. Not a vegan anymore but I still use your recipes!
こんばんは！
なんと京都に引っ越しですか( ´∀｀)！
なんともおしゃれなお部屋ですねー(*´ω｀*)
これからどのように生まれ変わるのかとても楽しみです(*´∇｀*)
屋上があるならまた家庭菜園もやるのですか？？
もしやる機会があるのならぜひ見せていただきたいです！
あとユッカはどうなったんですか？？
りょうやさん自身で荷物運び入れるんですねw
I'm looking forward to see your new kitchen.
おっしゃれー✨
Some people can do anything! I feel useless all of the sudden!😖😧
You can buy a small fridge, one that fits beneath the table? That way it wont obstruct the view. You could even cover its front with planks so that it matches the table :)     I'm looking forward to see what you create in your new kitchen!
Congrats on the new place! Enjoy it and thanks for sharing with us!
Ryo you literally made videos about your new transition and shared them with your audience. I literally feel like we're moving with you. So glad that things are going so well, I hope you love your new place! Can't wait to see how you go from here.
This channel is a treasure.. ❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations for a new apartment, it's a cool space))
お引越しお疲れ様です。いつも楽しく見てます。京都にお引越しされたのですか？
What a beautiful new space for you. You have such a calm presence about you. Much love from New Zealand 😊
Waaa! Welcome to your new apartement! Looking forward to new videos!!!
lol i came just to see his face
Your new studio looks really nice
good luck with your new house!!! I can't wait to see the forniture :) also, we got a samsung family hub fridge and I think you could like it (it's quite big tho...)
your new place looks lovely I hope for more vids to come 😄
Honestly so excited to see the completed kitchen and all the new diy furnitures hahaha 💛
Hello Ryoya!
Could you please answer our questions? We are curious to know more about you ^^
Are you living alone? And do you have someone to date and how old are you? Tell us more about your life. Make a draw my life video to introduce yourself.

Everyone hit the like button to let him read my comment please!!! 💪💪💪
コンロの油とか階段下まで落ちそう
Hi Ryoya! What a lovely place! I can’t wait to see how you’re going to transform the place!
Would love too see your new kitchen design ❤️
I too miss the old place. And I am sure you will make this also a lovely place with your DIY skills. wish you all the good luck.
Congratulations on moving. The new place looks nice !
関西進出ですか！？
私も関西いた時は京都に住んでふらっと三条通り散歩するの
憧れてました！
京野菜使ったお料理動画が見られそうですね。楽しみにしてます！
I'm loving this! So exciting!
Looking forward to seeing your kitchen!
Thanks for sharing your journey, can’t wait to see it all come together!!
congrats on moving! can't wait to see the new kitchen when it's done!
It seems that this place is smaller than the old one.
It looks so beautiful place and wishing you smoothly moving into a brand new lovely home :)
Interesting new layout.  Looking forward to your creative transformation.  Now that you have a rooftop, will you be planting your home garden up there?
Congratulations Ryoya!! It's very beautyful this change you deserved it
I love all your videos. This new space is lovely. I look forward to seeing how you arrange and decorate. Wishing you happiness in your new space.
Why did you move?
Are those concrete tables usual in Japan ?
I love how rustic and clean that new table looks! How pretty!
I wonder what will be your new setting 🤗👏👏👏
わぁ〜、どうなっていくか楽しみぃ〜♪でも京都⁉️キッチンのシンクがちっさwここはあくまでもスタジオとしての場所なんですかね？
What a beautiful house! Good luck with creating your new kitchen!
i honestly dunno how you make everything look thoroughly planned. 
like when you assemble the table, i would've clear the cardboard box first before I assemble the table, thus my floor would have scratches.  
anyway, congratulation on moving to new place! i heard kyoto is such a nice place. 🙂
I love your videos, nice apartment~
Such a beautiful new place ^^
Can't wait to see it all set up!
I hope you make a tour around your studio, it looks soo beautiful💖💖
Wow it is beautiful, it is so spacious for one person. Anw I am excited to see your new videos.
Wow.. that's pretty cool... industrial style..I like it. This place more spacious also the colour ambients it's just cool! Thumb's up Ryoya!
Can't wait for a new design n set up. 
Good luck! 
頑張って！
前の家の方が良かった
Hi, please post new videos .Thank you :-) Love your work
it's been a week and i miss him already 😩
So nice o.o like whoaaaa. I'm so happy for you Q.Q, you are goals ~~
Beautiful home. Congratulations!!
長距離引越しだったら家具類持って行かないかー
前の動画での読みが外れた〜！？

いや、まだチャンスは…
Absolutely stunning space!
Haa its gonna take a while to get used to but it looks good!
I have missed a lot. Why did you move to Kyoto ?
His house is so futuristic and ‘still’. Looks very clean and I love it❤️
京都とは意外ですね。しかし、ちょっと微妙だと感じました・・ｗ
I think there the food will be MORE delicious!!!
Tokyoから京都まで引っ越しましたか？
Thanks for sharing your moving journey with us. It's very relaxing and interesting.
How much is your new place cost per month?  Kyoto is expensive.
京都！！ thanks for sharing with us your new chapter. I subscribed your channel years back when the subscriber volume is less than 10K.  Have witnessed your creativity and transformation :)   You were a thin young man, those were the days. 
Love you:)
❣Happy living, Ryoya, in your new home. It's very white in my eyes, surely soon you'll give it your special 'flavour'. I'm curious what will be the first meal you prepare there... Love, Monika❣
コンクリート打ちっぱなしですか!?
冬寒そうですね!!!!
The new building you at it’s like Ando’s style🤔
This is a really nice place! I luv it
素敵すぎます〜〜🤭💗💗💗
your place looks amazing! can't wait for you to furnish it.
Love your new space, restroom too far. You'll stay in great shape
I like your new apartment very industrial looking.
Even when he is moving in large boxes he is peaceful!
So big for one guy xD
京都！いいですね〜
前にお住まいになっていたところと違ってクールな感じで素敵です😍
新居での動画楽しみにしています！
I'm in love with this guy 💕😍
関西にようこそ＼(^o^)／
Love it! Can’t wait to see how you design the interior. By the way, I’ve always wondered your main job. Is it possible to tell us?
Congratulations for your new acquisition! Looking foward for your new setup and recipes
Cool architecture - congrats Ryoya!
楽しみすぎる！！
めちゃ特殊な間取り？ですし
ワクワクすっぞです！
りょうやさんがコンクリ打ちっぱなしとタイル床の物件とは意外でした〜😊
京都への移住素敵✨
外国の視聴者さんが多いから京都VLOGとかも盛り上がりそうで楽しみ！✨
รอชมห้องใหม่ ครัวใหม่ๆอยู่นะคะ

Too clean and warm place. I look forward to see your new kitchen✅❤️
Your voice is really really relaxing 😎

Congratulations, have loved your videos for some time now!!
Loved it ! good luck ^^.
Minimalism at its finest! I love the new place cant wait for more videos to come
一人でテーブル起こす苦労・わかるわ〜ｗｗｗ
すごいお洒落なお家……これからのDIYが楽しみです(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)
Thank-you for your work and dedication.
古材のテーブルいいですね😊
今回は塩系な空間ですね！
Your video always inspired
ユニットバスかー
自分は耐えられないです。。。笑
The new place looks awesome! :D
Do you mind telling me the price of the table? Looks really well made and nice :)
お家綺麗すぎる…コンクリート張りの家羨ましい。これからも応援してます〜
りょうたさんも引っ越しなんだね〜。私も先月引っ越してまだ3週間ぐらいです。引っ越しって大変だよね〜、ほんと。お疲れさま。
毎回思うのですが、本当にセンスがいいですよねぇ〜(^o^)　これからも楽しみにしてます。
Cannot wait for the new food recipe video at the new kitchen
how is literally anything you do so therapeutic? is it a superpower of some sort? i don't understand but i love it! you're the hero for my wrecked nerves! :D
Please be my husband for my sake. lol 😂
すごーく素敵な空間❗動画楽しみです❗
If there is a God, he took form in the shape of this guy
Thanks for sharing this journey with us!!!
Oh my you move to Kyoto, I love Kyoto so much. Hope you have a great one in Kyoto
Hey, Can you make a Video of Vienna Coffee?
Your new place looks so different compared to your old place, from traditional to new age modern. Hopefully you get some sound absorbing boards to reduce the echoes.
miss your videos.
So happy to see your new place ~
Can't wait to see the completed space! I am dying to see the rooftop though, those mysterious stairs...
WOW, awesome space! Looks like a Tadao Ando building, really amazing! Looking forward for new videos in your new space :-)
You play the cello??!!! 😱 I play the cello too!!!! (1:26)
京都！？
ようこそお越しくださいました！
Seguro que hagas un bonito y creativo espacio 😘
Your new apartment is gorgeous, congratulations on your move! Looking forward to new videos in this new space!
階段を下りの怖くないですか！？
Thanks for the video. Looks really nice. Are you gonna live there or ist it just for work?
I think you should live in a wooden place, since you like that style!
Congrats on the new place man.
I love it if the kitchen looks old, rustic, slightly vintage japanese decor. It suits your channel.
This place look amazing 😭
コンクリ打ちっぱなしィ〜
wahhh congrats for your new place 😍😍😊🌌
Very nice and inspiring place! I wished could follow you everywhere you go. So peaceful.☺️

I love the new place! Can't wait to see what you do with the kitchen! ^^
Patiently waits for a new video*
Congratulations on your new place!
Congrats on the new place! Looks very nice!
Congratulations on your new place!
お引っ越しお疲れ様です！
前の前のお家から見ていて、
キッチンの壁や収納ができていく様子も見てきたので引っ越しは淋しい！
でもまた今回のオシャレなお家でどんな風に展開されていくのかもとっても楽しみです！
関西の野菜も美味しいものが沢山あるので引き続き期待しています！
I’d love to see you do a collaboration with Simon and Martina! I think you guys could create an amazing video! Much love.
Happy for you New Living Space Very Nice
新スタジオ、すごくすてき！
これからの展開が楽しみになります
The new home looks so nice! Looking forward to your new videos!
Beautiful new home and work space! Can't wait for all the new memories and videos to come! 💕💕
Good luck in the new place!
Loving the new place so far! Can't wait to see what is next ☺
Happy for your move looks awesome! ❤ love you Ryoya!
Can you make building and exterior tour...?
I didnt know that there are crazy places like that which a person can rent. Amazing!
Looks fantastic... can’t wait for the amazing cooking to begin!
Great new place, and am sure you’ll love it there - as much as we’ll continue loving your videos.
Yaay the new place looks so lovelyyyy <3
He is my new man-crush
京都に実家あるので、何だか嬉しいです！！会えるかも…です！（笑）
The old place looks cozier:
You moved to Kyoto, nice apartment. Hope to see your next Video.
Welcome to Kansai area 👋🏻 I hope you like it here 😊
塩系のお部屋（＾ω＾）
welcome to Kyoto!!
Waouh, you have a lot of space. Must be expensive.
That's one beautiful new space for you :)
相模原だからいつか会えるんじゃないかなんて期待をしてたが………

新天地京都でも素晴らしい動画を楽しみにしています✨
looking forward to you build all again!
屋上もあって広くて素敵なお部屋ですね
これからの動画楽しみです(^^)
やっぱり京都。
相模原から居ないのが寂しいです
相変わらず素敵です。
素敵なおうち＼(^^)／❤
I love the design of the new place
Your cello case is really pretty!!
your new place looks really nice!
what happend to your old kitchen? Miss the old place too^^ but im happy  for you!
京都ですか！
私は関西です
和歌山の魚とフルーツ美味しいですよ〜〜
completely unrelated but the way he cut the boxes is so neat and pretty? I've never seen anyone so delicate opening boxes before. also I'm excited for the videos of you building the new kitchen! really anticipating what it's gonna look like ^^
How big is your room in m2?
Love the grey concrete wall :)
Love your new table! It looks like one made by a woodworker in Italy
家が綺麗で落ち着いた感じもあるんですね。新しいのキッチンを楽しみしています！
素敵なお部屋ですね(^○^)どんなキッチンになるのか楽しみにしてます(^ ^)
BGM……kind of weird
机の色とコンクリート？の壁の色が合ってていい感じですね！
The stairs to the laundry room is kind of steep but if you're careful you'll be fine. Have a great time in your new studio :)
So modern and industrial I love ❤️ it.  I can’t wait for your new videos.  😘
Please makes food with asmr real soon! Im waiting for it 😊😊😊
ごろっと雰囲気変わりましたね〜！投稿楽しみです！
That’s my dream place! It’s so flippin awesome! ^+^
綺麗サッパリな部屋を見ると改めてDIYのすごさが分かる
What is your profession when you aren't doing YouTube videos. If you are uncomfortable you dont have to answer
is your main income youtube? because that looks like a suppper expensive studio
コンクリート壁で寒くないの？笑　でもとてもきれいです！
Love the new place! ☺
I recommend highly using undercounter refrigeration. Subzero is tops, but personally I use also Summit and Uline successfully. Get multiple units if you need more storage, including all freezer units if needed. It is a more expensive solution, but totally worth the clean lines and unbroken countertop horizon. Best wishes from an architecr.
cant wait to see the final result! ❤️
めっちゃ広い…！！！！
I always have a thing for soft spoken guy. Where can i get your duplicate or clone???
いらっしゃ～い。京都へ

走りに行きましょう。花背いいところですよ～。

めっさおされ。
オシャレすぎて私は住めない笑笑
Awesome!! Love the new place. Can't wait to see your first cooking video at the new home!!!
Your new place looks really nice and has lots of space. Can't wait to see what you do with the kitchen. 😊
If you don't mind me asking, What job or business do have??   <3    I look up to having a lifestyle similar to yours...
Congrats on your New Studio! In New York a Studio is a very small apartment, your place is an entire apartment with rooftop, Nice! Change is good, do take the time to design in your style...Great minds and beauty are not created in a day. Best Wishes in your new place!
i love how everything is neat ♥
gorgeous Kyoto and congratulations on the new home .
In America we always use dry wall on our walls (pasted, taped, and painted).

What are the gray studded walls all about I always see in Japan? 

What are they made of?

I like the clean, symmetrical look, albeit somewhat different from the smooth drywall look elsewhere.
I'll move in with you ;)
Great looking place :)
めちゃくちゃカッコイイ！
家賃高そう
創造性のために非常に良い良い場所！市によって書かれた ---
引っ越しお疲れ様でした。
京都なんですね。
素敵なハウスです✨✨
I think your new home look great. It a tiny living.
オシャレなおうちだなぁ。階段がキツそうだけどｗ　DIY楽しみにしてます(^^)
It is incredible how you manage to transmit so many emotions through your videos, you really want to cook after seeing them.
One ends with a lot of peace of mind, not to mention that the aesthetics of your videos is impeccable, you have something very special here, you can be proud.
It gives me great pleasure that you are progressing and now you have the workplace you want.
Thank you very much for giving us this type of content.
Congratulations on your new home!
peaceful cuisine? more like peaceful construction
なんかコンクリと鉄階段って冬寒そうですねw
Nice*^^*
I love your channel❤️😭
Looking forward your new videos coming :)) hope you will upload them soon haha :))
Loved seeing this ❤️
Cant wait to see how you transform your new space. You set the bar really high from the last place.
新しい場所、新しいキッチン…これからも投稿楽しみにしてます！
yay~ im so excited
Congrats on your New Studio! In New York, a Studio is a small apartment, but your place is an entire apartment with rooftop! Change is good, do take time to build in the furniture that will fit your style...great minds are not created in a day. Best Wishes in your new place!
Tokyoかと思ったらKyoto！
これからryoyaさんの動画が徐々に京都弁になってゆくのですね笑
どんな家になっていくのか楽しみです。
This man is the pinnacle of living
素敵なお部屋ですね＾＾屋上もあるなんて羨ましいです。実は私も最近引越しました。京都か〜☆いぃな♡何で京都なんですか？
Looks like an awesome place! :D
The flat already looks nice, but it's going to look even nicer :D
リョーヤくんはそれでもカセットコンロ使うと思う(笑)
更なる進化ですね！これからも楽しみにしてます！
I love how minimalistic your new place is 😍
Stairs. Yikes. Concrete/tile walls. Yikes. I hope you have peace and happiness there. Congratulations.
Can't wait to see how your new studio looks like!
お引越しお疲れ様です
体を壊しやすい季節となったので
無理なくお過ごし下さい
投稿楽しみにしてます(о´∀`о)
頑張って下さい
Wow! It looks wonderful. However, those stairs... They look super scary. ;-;
今度はまた全然雰囲気の違う部屋ですね！DIY楽しみにしてます
なんか、いつも見てて思うけど、りょうやさん、財力がやばい気がする。
この新居とかもだけど、前の家とかも凄く高そうですよね…
I MISS YOUR COOKING VIDEO :( COMEON PLEASE
I agree with most here, the new place looks great, but it also looks really small compared to your old apartment.
新しいスタジオDIYが楽しみです！
Awesome!! I’d love to see the decoration progress! Keep these videos coming pls~
It looks so clean and peaceful, can't wait for a new video!
Love your new workspace! I hope to see many more wonderful new videos of your new kitchen!!
New place looks like a 7DTD POI.
すごくセンスのいい新居ですねー裏山しい！
やっぱ一番好きなチャンネル…人生のご褒美タイム…
かっこいい家ですねぇ〜、憧れます！新しい家での動画楽しみにしてます！
これからも頑張ってください！
Really nice space. It feels more.. mature?
Ohhh my god 😱😱 my favorite white color 😍😍😍  waiting for using those all items 😘😘🤤🤤🤤
My favorite thing about your videos is that no matter what the topic is (cooking, moving furniture, etc...), your videos always give out a very peaceful energy, staying true to the name of your channel, and making me love all your videos. I’m no cook nor am I obsessed with food, but I love your videos for the peace it makes me feel and I thank you for that. Nowadays, everyone in social media is loud and desperate to get other people’s attention, which turns me off. You managed to get attention without much noise and I think it’s an art, the art of beautiful peace. Domo Arigato! 🙏🏼
またDIY動画が見れそうで楽しみです！
これから楽しみ😊
縦長の家ですか
IM SOOOO EXCITED TO SEE YOU SHOOTING NEW COOKING VIDEOS IN THIS PLACEEEE OMGGGGG
japanese home s are really compact and pretty  :))
まさかの京都、いいセレクトです！
あ、京都の人です
The new place looks really nice !!
Wowww so amazing and exciting to start it again😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
welcome to Kansai!!! XD
This is awesomely modern and spacious
I lived in Kyoto I miss it so much!!
これからの動画もとっても楽しみです！☺
Your old place and new place both look so cool! Should I move to Japan? Lol
Good luck with the new studio!
Congrats for the new place, I love the concrete walls! Maybe an idea for your fridge: in order to keep my space feeling minimalist, bright and open, I bought two small fridges and a chest freezer (don't know if that exist in Japan) and installed them under my giant kitchen island/bar/worktable. I just have to roll the freezer out when I need to open it.
かっこいいー
うらやましー
道中お疲れ様でした🚘
ステキなお部屋ですね
どんなお部屋にするのでしょう
自分の部屋じゃないのに
今から楽しみでワクワクする💗
can't wait for the new cooking video there
I don't know😟 it looks a little like a cold cell... I will miss the old place, was so warm. But I wish you all the best for your new starting! 🙂
AM  I THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS LIKE A PROUD MOM WHILE WATCHING THIS VIDEO
京都住みです。
こんなにステキなお家があるのですね！
Where were you originally from? Nice studio!
omedetou~!!!
仕事って何されてるんでしょうか？？
C'est super beau
おっしゃれ～な空間に頭真っ白...になりそうですが、
以前のキッチンを思い出す温かみを感じられる
木目のテーブルにほっとします～　（ﾜｸﾜｸ）
Your beautiful videos are what made me try harder to make delicious vegan food. Somehow, and I don't know why either, it feels like in between the sound of a blender and the cracking of coffee beans beeing toasted should be a bit of shy laughter or moaning for trying a new dessert. Not from you, but from a partner. Perhaps is my mind that tries to find companions even for my inanimated kitchen cutlery - I've everything in pairs haha, or perhaps is the feeling of intimacy and wonder that your videos give. Anyway, I wish you joy in your new home.
PS.: Have you tried a variety of Brazilian coffee beans? If there's a post code to where I could send a bag of my favourite to you, as a house warming gift, it would be lovely. 
Keep on the fantastic work and best of luck in your new place.
It looks pretty but a bit smallaer than the other one ^^ I will wait to see the new kitchen and diy
こうゆう動画も好き！
こういう家めっちゃ憧れます
YouTube御殿ですな！分かります。
お引越しお疲れ様です！
どんなキッチンになるか楽しみです(* ˊ ω ˋ *)
新しいおうち楽しみ♫私も近々引越すので 色々参考になります〜
打ち付けカッコいいな(^^オサレｗ
I love the new place layout, I want to see the rooftop :D
I hope you'll be happy in Kyoto. Nice place, I can't wait to see how will you set up this new kitchen :)
J'adore ce nouvel appartement 😍
Can’t wait to watch more videos from this beautiful place !!!
夢が広がりますなぁ
Very cool place... I hope it inspires you and us as well :)
Your new studio is gorgeous.
Your new space looks great! Happy for you!
コンクリ打ちっ放しって結露とか心配だけど、そこはきっちり対策してそう
おめでとう! Will you tell us why Kyoto at some point? Very interesting to have so many levels!
Ooou that table! Love the look of the new place! Good luck! がんばってね👍🤗
I like it very much. I hope you are happy with the new space! <3
Looking forward to your new videos in the new house!
Woah i like this type of studio!
You play the cello? omg
can't wait to see your complete kitchen!!!
引っ越しお疲れ様です  私も京都に住んでます いつか遭遇出来たら嬉しいです(^-^)なかなか難しい確率ですが…。新居でのvlogも楽しみです
how about a full course meal for the new studio(and stove;))
うおおー！予想が当たった！
と言うか、りょうやさんがおらの大好きな京都に住むだなんて、オラァ〜ワクワクすっぞ！鳥肌たってきた。
京都は寺社仏閣から自然、歴史と文化、京野菜、カフェやコーヒー豆、雑貨、アンティークショップ等超オシャレスポットを営む猛者どもの巣窟ですからね。
これはヤバい事になったぞ！(o^^o)
心機一転頑張りましょう！
WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE UPDATES ABOUT THE NEW HOUSE!!!!!
京都と滋賀は近いですね。お会いが出来たら、良いですね。
How can this be aesthetically pleasing ohmylawdd
相変わらずオシャレっす
The minimalism God!
Wonderful! Greetings
この部屋がどんなオシャレ部屋になるか楽しみすぎる
Peaceful Cuisine, Hi, I was wondering what will you call the colour of your profile picture? It is not eactly a green colour. I really like it. Thank you.
引っ越しですかー、衣替えの時期ですかね😁
僕は珈琲が好きなんで動画待ってますw
新しい家でもエンジョイして下さいね！
can't wait to see your new kitchen

楽しみにしてます。完成。
京都に引っ越しされたのでしょうか？
いつもアップ楽しみにしております。
Ryoya, we miss you!!!!!

I really love your peaceful cooking, peaceful DIYs... But more than that ; your peaceful Japanese language. It is the first time I can understand a lot of what is said in Japanese.😀
he's so excited to be moving! it's so sweet to see him so pleased!
what a beautiful space!!
Me encantan tus vídeos! Mucho mucho muchooo
I had dreamed of you yesterday.
That's it! I'm becoming vegan, just haunt me no more in my dreams please 😂😂😂 or you know what? I don't mind a hunk in my dreams anyway lol
You're old place looked better, the new one seems cold with all the grey walls, but I'm sure it'll look better once you get new furniture.
Nice apartment. Looks almost like a Tadao Ando design.
Love your vids keep them up ty 🎻
diy go go
Looking fwd to part 2 😊
What an exciting new chapter in your life. I wish you happy and creative times in this new space 🌱
ようこそお越しやす！
It’s aesthetically beautiful!
nice place! good luck unpacking :)
how much a month ryo? 5000usd?
京都とは！！コンクリート打ちっぱなしの素敵なお部屋！新しいお部屋のツアーも期待していますが，素敵な史跡・名勝も多いと思うので，そういった場所の撮影も期待したいです！
京都にお引っ越ししたんですか！？大移動ですね
京都ですか？！何かゆかりのある土地なのでしょうか？
Congratulations on your new home and studio.  It looks nice already.  I can't wait to see your creations.
Beautyfull place, but the sound must resonate a lot here
素敵なスタジオになりそうですね。今回はスタジオと自宅を分けるんですか？
easier than ikea dude
すっごい良い家。家賃高いんだろうなぁりょうやさんの収入がめちゃ良いことが分かりました(笑)
Your new studio is so cool
how do you fit a bed up those stairs??
前の家、収納 たくさんあって住みやすそう。
yay! can't wait to see your new video in your new place!
Your smile is contagious ☺️
コンクリ打ちっぱは冬寒そう…
I hope you settle down here well!
憧れる。by 受験生
新しいのキッチンのレイアウト楽しみです。 I can't wait to see the new layout!! :3

I love your videos 💕
こういう家いいな〜
引っ越しお疲れ様です！新しいおうちでどんな動画が出来上がるのか楽しみにしています！これからも応援しております。
If it's a small fridge why not put in below the small table as it would obstruct or be in the way of the stairs!
I ll definitely miss old kitchen.  :(
Finallyyyyy 💖
insert nuts to assemble the legs
次の動画も楽しみにしてます。
素敵な家ですね！！！引っ越す前も引越し後も！
Waaw awsome new home, congratss👍👍👍
引っ越しお疲れ様でした！

新居に引越し おめでとう🎉
Your place looks lovely :)
京都いいにゃー。家賃20万はいきそう。
I love the new place.
why did you move to Kyoto? is the new place rent or did you buy it?
Such a cool new place!
かっくいい
Lovely place congrats!
これだけコンクリートがむき出しだと音の跳ね返りが凄そう。吸音材とか貼るのかな。
すごーいの一言です。益々のご繁栄を。
love those exposed walls!
素敵なおうちですね！
Looking forward to see what you're going to do with your kitchen. So exciting.
京都！地元に帰った時にもしかして、りょうやさんとすれ違えるかも！？
I miss cooking video from Peaceful Cuisine XD. I suppose Ryoya-san has his schedule full with projects but just if there is time, I want to watch new vegan cooking video for summer. Possibly any meals that have beets as the ingredients. Doumo arigatou :)
首都圏離れると色々と不都合も出て来ると思いますが、買い物はネットでなんとかなるのかな？
出来れば地産のレシピとかあるとうれしいです。
Nice new office and more professional look.
Yeeeeeayyyy......
The new place looks so nice!
明るくて素敵なところですね。料理もさらに映えて見えるでしょう。
🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
キッチンツアー 楽しみにしてます!!
Otsukare san👍
新しいお家、海外のホテルみたいで素敵ですね！
無機質なデザイナーズルームに、温もりのある木のテーブルを置くのがなんだか綾也さんらしいなと思いました。
また前のようにキッチンを作っていく過程も拝見出来たら嬉しいです♪
Cant wait to see your new kitchen!
I think the company name for dichotomic would be said as ダイコトミク! Lovely place, thanks for the videos!
おしゃれです💕😌
That stairs look so scary
Ryoya, don't you feel a little lonely ?.  I do understand Japan preferable as bachelor, still hard to accept tought
遠距離移動お疲れ様です(^-^)
今夜なんてとても涼しいので体調崩されないようにゆっくり休んで下さい☆
なんか1人で、まさか関西に引っ越されたりしないよねー(о´∀`о)なんて思っていたら、京都と見てビックリしました！
どこかでお会いできる機会を楽しみにしています。
あと新しいキッチンでお料理動画、とても楽しみにしています(o^^o)
りょうやさんの考えや行動がとても刺激になります。ありがとうございます。
I am not a big fan of the new house, but I hope you like it and have a comfortable live there :)
i want to move into a. space like this someday too! love how it looks like. I hope you will show us your progress!
I love the wood in that concrete and white space!!!
That kitchen won't be look like that anymore after he touch it
DIYでどれだけ雰囲気が変わるかわかる
the new table looks very good!
Look like a Tadao Ando style design apartment?
いやー。オシャレ笑
Good Luck!
Nice place!❤️
wishing you luck Ryoya
Beautiful place!
ああ、あなたはチェロをやっているよ！
the new studio looks like it was built by Tadao Ando :)
とてもステキなお家ですね！京都に引っ越された理由はなんでしょう？
前の家、1人で住むにはでかいよね
なんぼほど金あるん、
Waiting for new videos in a new place
and where do you sleep there?
なんか電話したくなる声ですよね〜
Looks very modern! i like it
Wow, nice to know that I'm not the only one that's moving too
おしゃれ～✨りょうやさんは別のところに住むのですか？？( 'ω')?
Whoever got your old kitchen furniture is lucky
おつかれさまです。
京都にお引越しされたんですね。
素敵なお部屋♬*°
新しいDIYや、お料理の動画、楽しみにしています！
これから、暑さが増して来ると思うので、お身体にも気をつけて…
京野菜が沢山出てくるかな？
plz show us the roof n bedroom next episode
言ってくれれば手伝いにいったのに
Can't wait to see the finished look
that space is so cool!
ワープしたみたい！！
こんな家、
憧れますね。
すんごいオシャレ😳
I misread New Work, I thought you moved to New York lol 😅
わくわくするー
おめでとうございます🎉！そのアパートは随分きれいなぁー。そういうで住みたいねー。(⌒▽⌒)
京都に住まれるんですね！
どこかでお会いできるかしら？
OMG THE DESIGN OF THE OLD KITCHEN HOUSE LOOK SO SAME AS MY ROOM WHEN I GO TO JAPAN
京都へおいでやす！
Congratulations
Congratz!
Congrats! Looks very nice ^^
Congratulation
Awsome work space
جميل جداً 🌟☁
horay.... yuhuu new view
新居は京都ですか、ようこそようこそ！錦市場あたりでバッタリ会ったら握手してください笑
So is the entire studio soundproof?
引越しお疲れ様でした！また動画お待ちしてまーす！
Congrats!
(ﾉ･ˇ∀ˇ･)ﾉおぉ♪
お引越し作業乙です！！
お洒落なおうち
Fresh start, I like it.
i love his videos
WHOO!!!! GOOD JOB!!
Wow! The place is so nice!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
きたああああああああああああああああああああああああ
Wooahh such a cool studio
Oh man, I hope if you ever do a meet & greet in Kyoto (or kansai area in general) it'll be the time I'm back, haha. 京都の写真など楽しみにしてます！今はロスに住んでいて日本が恋しいです
Nice place 🤗
Like
Noooooo!!!! More video))))) Congrats with your new home, new kitchen!)))) Lovly place!))))♥♥♥
damn he's hot af!
おめでとう!
そしてオレの貧しい日本語を許してください~
そのアトリエはなんか、寒そうでしょう？
前の家みたいにアトリエを居心地いいにしてつもりですか？そんなスタイルすっごく好きだった！
またどんどんヴィデオをアプロードしていて嬉しい！
3:34 turn on captions
えーーー！！京都？！
もし見かけたら声かけさせて下さい！
嬉しいーー(#^.^#)
Cant wait to see the final outcome of your kitchen!!!! Will you build something like your previous kitchen?
お引越しおめでとうございます！今後のＤＩＹ動画楽しみにしています。１年後にコンクリ壁と階段のある部屋に住んでみてのレビューなどされたら嬉しいです！デザイナーズ賃貸を借りる参考にしたいです♡
Where did he live before?😊
こんな広い家住んでみたいなぁ…
suuugoi! <3
Beautiful!
Are the Walls concrete?
全てがかっこいい
相当稼いでるんだろうなぁ
I kept reading this as new york table, and wondered what it was.
can’t wait 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻
So happy !!!!!!!! new kitchen!!!!!!  哇哇哇好开心啊！
さあーこれからこの
新居が彼のセンスでどう変わっていくのかが
凄く楽しみです。予算はどれ位で済んだのかも知りたいですよね。
ah legal boas ideias ....:-)
Where will u sleep?
Looks good :D
コンクリ打ちっぱなしにバーチカルブラインド、おしゃれですね。
I read it as New York studio and actually wondered why the interior looks like a Japanese house..
Very stylish !!
It’s huge! ❤️
The new place looks very good!! :)
金持ちやなー(´;ω;｀)
Nice Space !!!!
京都ですかぁ(^_^)
関西人として、歓迎致します。
ようこそおいでやす。
お菓子を真似するようで申し訳ないのですが、出来ればお店に出せたらいいなと思います。
一応りょうやさんに許可頂きたいなと思い、メッセージを送ります🙏
I just subbed ur videos r awesome
friendship ended with cooking videos, now DIY videos are my best friend
This is sick bro
5-hour drive??!! Wow, I wonder why his new place is so far from the old one. The new place still looks so dull and I can't wait for his vids about designing the place. But I bet it's gonna look smaller after all the designing that he's gonna do. Best of luck, Takashima-san!!!
fu*k that apartment look so good!!!!! I'd love to live in an apartment like this in Toronto
今度はどんなお部屋になるのかとっっっても楽しみです！
Congrats!!! 😃 😃
頑張ってください！
huge place and he’s got a car. he must be in a really good financial place.
That looks like a Tadao Ando house. I hope you will live very happily in your new place.
I do think that the old interior wouldn't even fit in here as this space is quite modern
Wow awesome new spot, congrats!
beautiful place
you shouldnt talk-u
ns background song
But how was the dentist?
Can't wait to see how it looks!
I am excited to see new videos in your new home.  Looks great!
Your apartment is so beautiful and spacious! Congratulations :) あなたのアパートはとてもきれいで広々としています！おめでとう！
LetMという映画のL役の沢尻エリカさんのお部屋にすごく似てる気がします(^^)素敵なお部屋ですね(^^)どんな風にレイアウトしていくのか楽しみです。
Ii kanji... industrial style deshô ... atarashi de kata desuka? Rental?Atarashi na uti ni shiawase !!! Gambate né...
Very beautiful place, but the old that more place na?
Wow looks nice! 👍
you're right it's Dikotomik the pronunciation of the brand. Omedeto for your new home. I am sure you are gonna do a nice kitchen. Gambatte !
オシャレなマンションですね✨
京都に引っ越しですか？
looks like a prison
where you gonna sleep? doesn't look like much room for a whole bed unless there's a room off to the side you didn't show
nice place! do u have a girlfriend or partner?
お引越しご苦労様です😊
京都へ行かれてしまったんですね。
でも、歴史あふれる素敵な街での新たな料理やDIY楽しみにしてます✨
You play cello?
The tone is quite gray and I like a brighter one. And I also think it's a little depressing from this space compared to the previous large sunny house. Is that because house price of Tokyo is much higher?
お引っ越しオメデトウございます❣
what does this guy do for work?
Can’t wait to see your new kitchen!
The fridge location seems unnatural to me. I mean it’s sort of blocking the staircase a bit. So every time you go down, it’s going to get in a way. Perhaps underneath the stair to the third floor?
!!!!!
Next video after this
地震大丈夫ですか？
Wow u made so much money out of this channel to bought that, good for u buddy
Nice lovely place
I think you must DIY your kitchen furniture.
まさかのお引っ越し😄それも京都やなんてねぇ😄なんだかワクワクしてきました。お引っ越しは大変やからお疲れが出ませんように❤
cool place!
Where did you lived before?
引越しお疲れ様でした(*^^*)
DIY楽しみにしてます！
What a lovely place!
So clean your new home is!!
Do you live alone?
音がすごく反響しそうなお部屋なのが、ちょっと気がかりです。
動画楽しみしてます。
はよー
It's cool looking but so many stairs...
京都に来はったんですね！
おいでやす😊
もし何処かでお会いできたらお声をかけさして下さいね！
Let us move in too
前々から思ってたけど、さては金持ちだな？
Didnt know homes like that exist in Kyoto. Gotta check those homes out one day in the future.
It looks nice!!!
that is such a cool apartment!!!!
Real zaddyish
I think  you need to make this apartament more warm...
My question is, how was the dentist ?
シャレオツ！実際生活してみるとメゾネットって暮らしにくいかなあ！でも完成が楽しみ！カーサブルータスに掲載されそうな部屋になるんだ､きっと！いかにもじゃなくて味のあるお部屋になるんだろうな！！
お引越し お疲れ様です。
玄米ご飯が好きで ヴィーガンの食事にも興味が有ります。機会があれば是非『圧力鍋』を使ったものを教えてください。ryoya さんが どんな『圧力鍋』を選択されるのか楽しみ。
I liked the other house better.
たぶん。。 Di-ko-to-mi-ku かな。。
You seem happy; such a pleasant space.
Wow! Awesome place!
The place looks awesome!
Gooooood luck!!! And the new house is nice,can't wait to see what you'll do!! We loveee you
こんにちは！私はアニメとyoutubeの多くを見ますが、私はあなたが私が見ているのは日本人です。その涼しいので、私は日本語を話せませんが、あなたが言ういくつかの言葉を理解しています！私はあなたがすぐにもっと多くのビデオを作ることを望む！
is this studio your house, or is it a separate space?
Nice smile at the end of the video!
UPGRADE
Omg this house is so nice
I love your videos!
I hope you enjoy the new City and the new apartment. 😁
Congratulations ! Kyoto is a wonderful city , I do hope that this change will be an inspiration for new adventures ! Will be waiting for your updates ! PS the company that you bought the table has a Greek 🇬🇷 name which basically means « divided »!
I love your new studio!
Word of advice, instead of saying [No Music] in front of every video title, say ASMR cause that’s what it is. Plus ASMR is popular and will grab people’s attention kinda lost me at “no music”
I like this guy. His videos are very soothing.
お引っ越しお疲れ様です(⌒‐⌒)🎶
屋上や明るいキッチン、これからの動画が楽しみなお家ですね🎵
お風呂の動画も(o≧▽゜)oﾃﾍｯ💕
What a beautiful home!
Are you allowed to color the walls or cover them with wood? Or do you like the concrete? I would feel like in a prison^^'
nice!
ほんとりょうやさんはエネルギーがパワフルで、見てる側も元気になります！
執着せず、目の前のことに向き合えるポジティブさを体現してくれてありがとう。
why you moved?
Looks very cool excited to see it
Am I the only one that feels like his new place looks like a prison?
階段の隙間が開いていて登るのが怖そうです😱。
京都に住むのですか？私は大阪なのでちょっとだけ親近感が湧きますね🎵

ちなみに私は関東から関西に来ました！！
Why did u move?
how nice!!!
Bizarre.....looks like a prison cell.
おき!
Can’t wait to see your finished kitchen.
またりょうやさんのDIYの動画を見られるのを楽しみにしてます！
pay attention, the metal can colour and scratch the tile and good luck!
Maybe you read it, ダイコトミック？
The word Dichotomic comes from the Greek word dichotomy which means ‘’split’’
I love it..
Happy moving day!
I'm starting gay
I am a fan Modernism but your new place is a Brutalist nightmare
What do you do when you can’t sleep?
最近眠れない日々が3日ほど続いてて辛いです。寝られないときはどうしてますか？
一人暮らしですか？
りょうやさん、京都に住まれるんですか？？京都に住んでいるのですがいいところですよ♪♪
前向きな引っ越しのようで何よりです。打ちっぱなしはやっぱりおしゃれですね。ただ、夏に暑く冬に寒い京都の気候をもろに食らってしまいそうでちょっと心配です。建ってすぐの一番湿気がこもる頃の物件というわけではなさそうですが、一応カビにも注意してください。…なんて、言われなくとも対策考えてそうですよね。失礼しました m(__)m
Wow
Noooooo!! >< I have so many memories of your previous apartment :(( a peace of soul left behind in the lit up wooden rooms and your hard efforts in making everything look homely. I guess people move on...>< still cant believe you moved! The next person who lived in your previous apartment will feel very happy cos you left it a happy spirit full of good laughter and very warm homely. I wish you all the best in your new home though:) looking forward to more up coming videos.
京都だったらいくらでも近所の街並みを撮せそう。
相模原じゃムリだからね全く絵にならないから。
I saw you have your cookbook on sale at Amazon but not in an English language version. Is that in the works? Estimated date for sale? Loving your productions and would like to see if I can replicate at home in my kitchen...Thanks!
スタジオ兼住みですよね？ユニットバスは…　１人暮らしならともかく　ねえ　…お洒落だけど、階段上がったり下がったりで実用的ではないなあ　
足腰が丈夫な若い時しか住めないよね～屋上があるのはうらやましい、縄跳びとか日焼け出きる
nha dep
😥😥
どうやったらこんなおしゃれな物件見つけられるのか。。。
正直料理よりもDIY的な動画のが好きな自分がいる
So where’s the bedroom?
Very nice new home. Now that you have access to a bright roof, maybe you can grow herbs and veggies to use in your videos. Can't wait to see your arrangements.
I like this bathroom.
京都ですか〜。なんだかちょっと意外です。もっと山に近いところへ引っ越すのかと勝手に予想してました。あ、でも京都も街中外れたら山が近いですね。夏暑く、冬寒い、盆地気候ですが新天地でまた楽しい動画いっぱい作ってください♪ 楽しみにしてまーす😃
お～～～！京都ですか。このタイミングは祇園祭近いじゃないですか！京都はいいですよ～。いい感じのカフェも多いし。和も重きに置きながら世界の食も見れる部分がある、そんな感じがします。
自分に子供ができない限り、お稚児さんは世界一かわいいです。
宇治で抹茶、嵯峨で豆腐と筍！
JET DAISUKEさんと家少し近くなりましたね
自分は畑を見にいつか京丹波や南丹市を訪れてみたいと思ってます。
自分も今年の春に引越ししました。大阪から兵庫へ。京都が少し遠くなって少しさみしいかな。簡単に行けますが…。
何故ゆえ京都に？
え！？！？京都にいらっしゃったのですか！？！？京都の街中で奇跡的に出会えることを切望いたします😭😭😭
ここは別宅ですか？
Im still worried about the amount of protein u take cyteic acid will build up in your body thus will cause gout in long term. This wont show up mb up yo five years of your habit. Balance is very necessary in everything.
りょうやさん　選択されたテーブルのサイズを教えて頂けないでしょうか？出来ればＰＣ用のテーブルと両方教えて頂けたらうれしいです。どうかよろしくお願いします。
今まで町田の方に住んでたのにいきなり京都？！なんでですか？てかなんですかｗあのオサレな打ちっぱなし空間はｗ
そもそもなぜ京都なんですか？？
金持ちやなあ
前より部屋が狭くなりました？
私も京都出身で宇治市からです。りょうやさんは京都のどこですか？
Very much a peaceful move. Your new place looks good; I’m mentally imagining what your kitchen will look like and from what angles we’ll be viewing your upcoming cuisine videos 🙈
Are you rich ?
Hi, Ryoya~ how are you? i m from HK. i like see your videos!! very good!! thsnks!
うへえ！前の棚類を惜し気もなく捨ててきたのかｗ今日ここの動画をいくつか見てるんだけど、ニーチャン何者Ｗ？スマートさに惚れそうやんけ！
我有一些疑問！你去過烹飪學校嗎？如果是的話，在哪裡？並且是你的全職工作youtube？如果不是，你在做什麼工作？ @peacefulcuisine
You wear crocs ? Unsubscribed....
How much does that cost. That looks like it would cost hella money in America G
😌😉👌
Um is there anything this guy can’t do ???
What is this gray material on the Walls?
You’re in Kyoto? What a gorgeous apartment. I miss Japan. You need s decent size fridge don’t buy too small.
Why dont you marry?
冬寒そう
Is it on iTunes?
こんにちは。
やっぱり以前の部屋が動画視聴者の私としては馴染みがあり寂しさもありますが、新しい部屋では、また以前とは違った雰囲気の動画が生まれそうで楽しみでもあります。
家具が私好みで見ていて楽しいです。リョウヤさんの家具の好みだともしかしたら既にご存知かも知れませんが大阪にあるTRUCK FURNITUREという店の家具が似合いそうだなと感じました。

新生活での部屋がどんな雰囲気になるかを楽しみにしています。
はじめまして！1983年生まれで板前やっております☺️
 綾也さんの動画は混ぜる音 切る音 砕く音 全てが見ていて 聞いていて心地いいですね！これからも応援しております。
お引越しおつかれさまです！！！！！！
why does he sound like a robot or like a ai  
like : "i would drive to kyoto, it will take 5 hours"(with no emotion & expression). Dude smile.. be happy.. stretch those cheeks!
ヘーゼルナッツバター作りにパナソニックのフードプロセッサーでチャレンジしたけどできませんでした。バイタミックスで作ったことはありますか？　もしあったら出来たかどうか教えてほしいです
Is Japan big house because land is cheap?
Oh~~ There's a nice place. Can't wait to watch D.I.Y. kitchen furniture. This studio has rooftop Woww~ 😱😎
較べモノには為らないケレド、何となくEmmaの最初のアパートを思い出したは（爆笑）❕ 幾ら数フロワーに別れてるとは謂へ、チョット狭くないか？ 天井が低いのと階段が狭いのも気に為るし、何よりオレの大嫌いなコンクリート打ちっぱなしッテのが最悪 - 死ね、安藤忠雄（大爆笑）❗❗❗❗❗❗🤧👇
Your videos are boring
My stomach dropped when I saw the title! But I'm so happy things are moving along!!
Whew I never clicked so fast. Glad you are just moving.---peace and love lsj
How you attached those planks to the wall was awesome! Didn't do any damage to the original wall. Very considerate for the next owners!
I aspire to be as organized as you
That is one lucky friend. Took him hours to put those tables and boards together.
How exciting to start a new chapter in a new space. Looking forward to seeing your new spot ☺
That empty feeling of moving house. I feel so sad (I won't lie, I teared up a bit) because of all the memories we have watched as an audience, but also exciting for the new house.
Peaceful cuisine has become 'pieceful' cuisine now 😂
aww, you’re moving out! but its okay, right? we can watch you build another kitchen, right? :)
Why is it so peaceful watching you work so hard?
I hope your new place is just as wonderful.
Jenn 💖 in Canada 🍁
This man is so sexy.  Plant based, can cook, handy with tools...
HE HAS A SOUND PROOF ROOM FOR MUSIC OMYHOSH
日本人の視聴者集合ー！
Removable wallpaper! Somehow I thought you went to mine & cut your own stones.
RIP kitchen. your kitchen was so amazing. Loved the design and layout. And how organized it was 😂😂
すごく凄くさみしい...
Peaceful cuisine の空間大好きでした！
あげてしまうなんて勿体ない...
でも物に執着しないスタイルもまたりょうやさんらしいですね。
次の生活はどんなものになるのか楽しみです。
So you mean to tell me that THE BRICK WAS WALLPAPER ALL THIS TIME??  O.O  Mind blown.  :D
もし私がこのマンションのオーナーだったら、『買い取るからそのままにしておいて』ってなるな〜😃
このキッチン大好きだったなぁ
行ったこともないのに、DIY動画などを見ていたので凄く愛着があります。
また新たなおうちでのキッチン動画、楽しみにしています！
ガツガツ感とかテキパキ感がなくて、緩やかな動作なのに、要領よく仕事が片付いていく様が いつも不思議な感覚になりますー。
つい１時間前に３年前の棚を作ってる動画を見たと思ったら次に見た動画で何もかもなくなっていた
Going to the dentist...what a cliffhanger!
きっとすごくめんどくさいことを黙々と1人でこなしているのを見て、彼が撮影も料理も、日曜大工も、陶芸も、英会話も、こうして器用にこなせるようになったのだと感じた。
周りはオシャレ過ぎて人生楽しそうとか簡単に言うけれど、それは日々の積み重ねが生んだんですよね。

テーブルはびっくりしました。
今後どんな場所に行こうと、彼は彼の家にしてしまうと思う。
これからの動画も楽しみにしています。
Somehow, watching your kitchen being dismantled makes me sad.
I'm sad and happy at the same time. I can't wait to see your new life adventure but so glad I can always go back and re-watch pictures of this familiar, cozy place. Have a safe, easy move. 🤗🏡❤️
Clicked so fast lol this got me worryin
え？！
木材剥がしたらすっごい普通の部屋
どんだけDIY能力高いんや
すごっ！
素敵なキッチンだったので、ちょっと寂しいですね。
それにしてもこれだけの撤去作業を一人で1日でやっちゃうの、
ホント手際がいいですね。尊敬します！
Good luck in the new place! Can’t wait to see new recipes in the new kitchen!
wow thats so amazing and interesting how you actually created your wooden set without damaging the house walls! You're so smart! Do you think you'd be able to make a tutorial on what type of equipment specifically is used when you made those removable walls?
こちらに引っ越された時凄く気に入っている様子だったのでしばらくはこのおうちにいらっしゃるのかと思っていました。
次はどちらに行かれるのでしょう？
I'm going to miss this kitchen but I am looking forward to seeing your new place.🎉
今度ここに住む人は、こんなにDIY凄い人が住んでたとは思わないだろうな〜〜
wow! im so excited to see your new kitchen! congrats on the move and i hope everything works out smoothly
このキッチン、料理系男性YouTuber達にどれだけ影響を与えてきたんだろう(笑)
Unexpected ending 😂😂😂
Remember when i watch your DIY about ur whole kitchen, it makes me sad tbh. I'l l'll be waiting for new videos about your new house senpai! 💪
I absolutely love this channel and I'm so glad that this channel will continue!!
歯医者行っちゃうんかい!w
基本アパートやマンションは現状復帰が当たり前だけど、りょうやさんの部屋だったらそのままの方が気に入ってくれそう。
更新嬉しいです！
もう引越し先で落ち着いていらっしゃるのでしょうか？
僕はこのキッチンを作る動画が大好きだったので少し寂しい気もします。
また新しいキッチンの動画も楽しみにしています♪
I was so shocked when I saw your post on IG and now me watching you put everything away is sad but also happy since you're upgrading.  Hope to see the recreation of your kitchen soon..  Goodluck!
YOU GOT ME THERE!!! i missed the cooking videos and then saw the title i thought OH NOO DONT STOP then... oh thank the lord you are just moving 💜

and btw, props to you doing all these by yourselves. fighting for the upcoming new chapter 💜
I’ll miss this place..
So sad, so many videos made in that kitchen... but glad you are moving on to better things in life!
こういう旦那さんが欲しい（笑）
キッチン制作のDIY動画から見ていたので，寂しく感じますね．4:14に出てくる棚を見て，先の長いドライバーを急遽買って取り付けていたシーンを思い出してしまいました…

引っ越しをされるということは，また新たなDIY動画がみれるのかな？という期待をしつつ続報を期待しています．
My favorite kitshen .. It's all gone now TT_TT 
Thankx for your hard works.
という事で…って、突然過ぎ！なぜにー？
今後も動画アップはあるのでしょうか？
楽しみに待っていてもいいのでしょうか？
まさかのキッチン消滅･････
新しいおうちが楽しみです( ´﹀` )

包丁のダマスカス模様がかっこいいですね！
I still remember the video of you moving in to this place, and now it's time to go. Great things ahead =)
この部屋から引越しちゃうのは残念やけど、また新しい部屋のDIYが見れると思うと楽しみ(´˘`＊)
I can't believe you DIY'd your entire cooking area. It looks so nice! I was shocked to see it came entirely from scratch. It looked 100% professional!
Ryoyaさんと知り合いだっら、色々と買取交渉できたのに…。
重労働お疲れ様です。
Please make a video of how you decorate your new kitchen if you have time. That would be awesome.
New kitchen, new recipes 💞
¡Amazing things will happen to you!
You are the best vegan chef in this world.
9:06 so that's how you remove those!
You scared me for a bit! Glad to see that you are just moving! Can't wait to see what your new place will look like! And your new kitchen! Take care!!! You are awesome 😁
勝手に愛着持ってたけど、そのキッチンが無くなっていく様は寂しいもんですね。
もっと料理動画とかDIYの動画とか出して欲しいです
ステキなキッチンだったので なんだか勿体ないですね…
でも次の家でもDIY楽しみにしてま〜す★
He bamboozled me with that stone wallpaper 🤪
The knife he bought looks similar to the one Jun has
マジックの種明かしを見ているみたい（笑）
You are so productive... I wish i have that productivity in me :(
うわーー、この空間好きだったからなんだか寂しいです、、(；▽；)
Everyone is worried about the title or excited/sad about you moving. 
Me: The drill is pink 😱🙈😂. 
I am so sorry 🙈
すごい!
おめでとう! 👏👏👏
Be Happy 😊 !
またね! 👍
The ending is definitely a plot twist lmao xD
You're a genius
I was like i wish i could do this in my apartment but i can't drill any holes in the walls, and then i see how you used the bars with the ceiling omg. My new project. Thank you!
思い出深いキッチン２回目のお別れかぁ。寂しいね。

チェロももうやらないのかな？
どんな演奏するのか動画を楽しみにしていたけど、残念。
急上昇おめでとうございます🎊🎉
keren....
despite of it is a conceptual documenter about dismantling the equipment down which have a lot of editing and re-take, but one for sure is everything was done in a neat, tidy and well organized.


mantap !!
No, you're moving. I will miss all the recipes you made in your kitchen Ryoya.
手際がいいなぁー( ^ω^ )✨✨
I watched you from installing to removing all these. So sad.
The damn packing is even satisfying like how 😭
WOAAAAH saw the title..
First thought: NOOOO
Second thought:Can I have it?
😂
Will be excited to see your new kitchen.
Why I love (and, hate) moving all in one video. I'll be doing the same in a few months, and I'm not really looking forward to it.


You never know how much stuff you actually have, until it's time to move.
Good Luck, Ryoya! But my biggest question is: How Did You Make That Little Jack For The Wood?!?!
Does anyone know?!
I'm sad 😥 I ❤️ your workshop and how you have everything organized
I got scared of the title, but I’m happy for you! 😊😊
お引っ越しされるんですね！！diy されたものを貰えるお知り合いが心底羨ましいです。。次のお家でのdiy も楽しみにしています🎵お引っ越し頑張ってください❗
キッチン作りの動画、通しで20回は見たからなんかさみしいなー😥
また新しいDIY動画待ってます👍
When I saw you breaking down the table, it reminds me the video that you made that table at the same position long times ago. That was the first time I saw your videos... Time goes so fast!
愛着あっても全部持っていくと費用が大変ですもんね。
また新居でのDIY動画楽しみにしてます！
I love how I’m procrastinating packing my stuff up since I’m moving in 2 days by watching someone else pack up to move... great video as always though ❤️
とても素敵なキッチンでした……！
なんだろ何回か見てしまうな。他人の人生なのになんか感慨深いのは何故だろうｗ　最初に見た動画は棚作る動画で同じインパクトレンチ使ってるなぁなんて思いながら見てたな。マットレスを既に買っているということは海外ではなさそうかな？　にしてもスパチュラの数多いわぁ。
Welp.. Time to get used to a new setting.. Good luck moving, dude! (≧∇≦)/
Loved seeing how you put together your own unique kitchen space with lots of timber and clever thinking. Thank you for sharing ^^
何をされても見習うことばかりですね
キッチンの壁も、カウンターも、Ryouyaさんが、頑張って作った時の動画を観ていたし、「すごいなぁ～」と思いつつそうゆうキッチン空間に顎がれていたので、なんとなく残念な気もして…
でも、引越ししてからの動画も楽しみにしています☺️
You look more handsome these current days :)
こんにちは！( ´∀｀)
エプロンの動画の時におっしゃってたかなりのサプライズ動画はこのことだったんですか！！
新居でもまた素敵なキッチンが出来るのでしょうけど、なんだかすごく寂しいですね。。笑
懐かしくて壁や棚を作った頃の動画を繰り返し見てます(*´Д｀*)笑
引っ越しが落ち着いたら、新居の紹介動画楽しみにしてますねー(*´-`)
I watched you put things together from day 1 but now a bit sad when you take them apart again. 
Looking forward to your new home
今の時代、引越しもお洒落。
久しぶりにコメントします
何事もちゃっちゃとこなしますね😆
最後歯医者行ってきますで
笑えました
今度はどんな素敵なお部屋になるのか  今から楽しみです
I hope your new place is even cooler than this one 😢
RIP HIS BEAUTIFUL KITCHEN
no im sad. :( but, glad things are going well. :)
Can't wait to see the new kitchen! Loving your work, man!
It's a difficult process but I love moving times. It is the proof of new beginnings. I hope it also means that well have a "move in" video😏. Thank you for letting us in in busy moments like these 😊
6:34 i thought that was real brick wall until you peeled it out
I don't understand how even a video like this has such beautiful and relaxing shots
Wow. You're the only man who's working that I don't tire watching. Your videos are so calming... What kind of sorcery??? Hahaha
That is actually SO cool how you've used the space in your old apartment, that's so creative! Best of luck in your new apartment! :)
I love how asthetically pleasing your videos are!! Also, your voice is beautiful 💖✨
First!!!!
Hello Ryoya! 
Excited about your new place and how you’ll change it too!
May you please try to make meals with 0 waste? I think you’ll enjoy the challenge :)
Good luck with the move!
My dream kitchen!  Noooo!  

Congrats on the move :)
次のステージも楽しみにしております！
It's so cool to see everything being taken apart like this.
動画待ってましたぁー！




動画出るまで過去の動画見まくってました(笑)高校の友達にオススメしときました！(*´ｖ`)みんな動画の雰囲気とか好きって言ってましたよ！
動画内に出てきた女性は奥様ですか？？
For some reason, when I watch you I get the urge to grow up and have my own, clean home.
So sad. I loved all of your episodes where built this wonderful kitchen. Looking forward to your next project.
you know what, I just followed your channel and just for a while I watched your video that you setting up your kitchen.... and now watching you dismantling everything in this video. 

///screaming internally
JFJRJFJTH I THOUGHT someone robbed your kitchen
すごい！
あなたは良い夫のように見える 😍
Watching this be deconstructed really goes to show how much movie magic goes into the show. I'd only seen a few episodes and thought you were in a shop; rather than an apartment.

I felt so betrayed when I saw the removal of the "brick". I saw everything else being removed and thought "well he couldn't have added THAT bit. It must just be a really fancy appartm- OoO"
最後の女性は彼女さんか奥様ですか？🤗
今のキッチンが見れなくなるのは寂しいけど、また新しいご自宅のキッチン楽しみに待ってます☺️
To new beginnings! I like how you did your walls. I was looking for a way to update mine without painting them due to our cat. Your method is perfect!
it's amazing how he put wooden dowels without nailing them into the wall and made his whole kitchen without scratch a wall of the original apartment, I was baffled
You’re amazing 👍🏼 best wishes from Saudi Arabia
I still find it so impressive that you can DIY so many counters/hooks/racks without drilling into the wall a single time.
どうなっちゃうんだろう？楽しみでもあるけど
You're just so god damn ORGANIZED. When I moved dorms in college I absolutely dreaded packing all my stuff up. And that was just a tiny room of stuff! I admire your work ethic, sir.
New kitchen, new recipe...
Hopefully :)
So worried when the title stated that your kitchen was gone. I thought someone came and robbed your stuff! So excited you are moving !!! 🎊
Peaceful Cuisine は次どうするか楽しみです！Happy Moving！Blessings...
Más adelante espero ver qué sigue.  Solo hablo español,pero me gusta mucho ver tu canal, y trato de entender solo con lo que veo.   Que salga muy muy bien el plan que tengas.   😃😀. SHALOM
nooo :( i'll miss this kitchen background
So sad. Your kitchen was so amazing
Feels so nostalgic, I remember watching videos of him building this kitchen :') Looking forward to more amazing things!
あのテーブルって天板乗せただけだったんだw
Clicked so fast when I got the notification 😩
My son is six years old and loves watching you. Good luck in your new place.
It’s amazing!! You made such a good job whithout making any hole in the wall!!!! Welldone !! So where do you move ?
Nooo! I’m going to miss this kitchen. So many good tingles were experienced here. RIP.
So proactive.
Hope to see new kitchen soon! I love your design and creativity
Ur place is so lovely! Sad to know ur leaving 🙄
I am moving this week too! So much boxes and tape! 😁 Best of luck and I cannot wait to see your new place!
I am so impressed that you built that kitchen area!
Your aparment was so nice and airy. It always seemed nice and new. Hope the new place is just as good! I definately am missing your foodie videos. Look forward to seeing them soon☺
I will forever be amazed at how you can do everything and anything and on top of that make it seem easy * . * #goals #perfection
お久しぶりです！待ってましたー😊
ってえええ！引っ越ししちゃうんですか⁉︎ でも、りょうやさんならまた素敵なキッチンを立ち上げてくれると信じてます。色々お忙しい中動画をあげてくれてありがとうございます！
i never knew that watching dowels being removed could be so satisfying ♥
I really like your kitchen !!!  so many recipe in here! it is really good to protect the wall and the wood can recycling, can't wait to see your new kitchen. lol
I hope u have more luck in your new house💪.... i don't know why but my busy mind it's became in peace when i watch u 🌷🌷🌷
I'm going to miss this kitchen! But also excited to see the new place. Also I think the way you make the counter table using three separate drawers and a wooden top is genius!
Can't wait to see you organize the new kitchen!!
I loved your kitchen 😣
But your next one will be great too. Good luck with the move!
Reads title: so where'd it go?
Reads who uploaded said title:
WHERED IT GO!?
ダボにネジを刺してくぎ抜きで引っこ抜く方法もあるよ
Wish you have great time as always.. :) ganbatte.! Ryo
It's amazing how you were able to decorate the walls and everything without altering or damaging the original ones! It's inspiring!
But the beautiful lighting? 😢 it made it so peaceful.
those adjustable pillars are amazing, no nails on the wall, totally clean , i love that!!
This made me feel incredibly sad. It felt like the end of an Era.
なんか寂しい
次のお家もまた楽しみにしてます
Your videos are so lovely!♥️  good luck with the move!
Coming up next, Peaceful_Cuisine Version 3.0 😉
Even when you're moving out you do everything so carefully and skillfully . Glad that you're just moving out man
疲労感とかないのかな、て思うw技術もだけど体力がえぐい
賃貸でもそうすれば壁にアナ開けずに済みますね！
素晴らしい✨
もうヴィーガン料理しないのですか？
Hopefully the cooking videoes will continue :)
Loved your kitchen but I’m sure your new one will be more amazing.
I clicked at the speed of light thinking you got robbed or something! I am so glad it was just that you were moving! 😥 Best of luck!
I won't marry a guy unless he is as efficient and handy like Ryoya.
And of course he'd better be a good cook too ;)
Looking forward to the new home and kitchen~ take us with you in ur new journey! 💞
i wish you all the very, very best in your new home. peace, love and sunshine!!
Your kitchen you built was brilliant, you are such a creative person. Look forward to seeing the next chapter
The illusion of space and atmosphere, the visual tricks to sell your self and your work. Incredible! All of it worth it.
Moving is always sad and exciting at the same time1
Saw the title and I was like "WHAT ?? NUUUU!!" ,then I red the description :v
いつも楽しく拝見しています。
今回の動画でこのステキッチンともお別れなんですね…。
次の部屋でもDIYされるのを楽しみにしています。
歯医者行ってらっしゃい！笑
引っ越しは順調でしょうか？後ろの壁や手作り棚の時に一拍言葉が止まったので、過去動画見てきました。
大切に使ってくれる人にお譲りしたと思いますが、私的にちょっと寂しいですね(すみません)
引っ越し先の動画を楽しみにしています。
偶然、私も歯医者行ってきました。歯医者嫌い...w
I was so scared :(
always love your kitchen design.. looking forward for new set up
Wow I love how modulable this kitchen was and I'm excited to discover your new space !
この部屋が見れなくなるのは 残念です！
次の部屋も期待してます。
待ってたよぉ〜
Interesting wooden wall construction. Gives me ideas! Thanks
I doubt that glass jar gonna survive during the moveout with that much of bubblewrap
I literally just came to this video after watching you build the kitchen shelf, and to see you take it apart just hurts because it looked like it took time and hard work putting it together 😭
He put a lot of effort into decorating this place now onto bigger things, I wanna see how he decorates the new house
The music sounds like the ones I hear when playing Nintendo.
Good luck on your move. Looking forward to more videos in the new place.
Bloody hell, what a genius way of putting up temporary walls in a rental!
新しいキッチンが楽しみです！ワクワク！
واوووو👌بالبداية متوقعت انك شيف حسبت شغلتك نجارة بس ممتع نظر لك انت  تبذل كل جهد بشيء تحبه 😊👏
え？あげちゃうんですか？
次のお部屋ではまたDIYがみれますか？(*^▽^*)ワクワク
すごく寂しい感じがするけど、新しい住まいでもDIYしてくださいね😀
Coming up next, Peaceful_Cuisine Version 3.0 ;)
引っ越し先でもDIYやるんですか？
とても楽しみです。
お引越し、無理し過ぎずに頑張って下さい！新居も楽しみにしています
laughed so hard at the ending. That was so randome :D
The title scared me 😣 glad you're just moving! Can't wait to see what the new place looks like!
I'm so happy for you but I loved this kitchen...
Aww I really loved everything in that beautiful kitchen. Goodluck with the move!💕💕
Have a save move and I can't wait to see what your new kitchen will look like! Much love from Ohio!
you should make more videos like that :)
yall should've seen my face when he revealed that the brick wall accent was just wallpaper
even the moving boxes in japan are cute!
I’m so excited to see your new kitchen 🤩😂😍😍😍
Super excited about your move! Good luck :D
Why everything you do seems so sexy >///< can't wait to see your new one
noooo when you disambled everything :'(
I was wondering how you will remove these dowels just from the moment I saw their installation.
You're just so....adorable!!! 💖
❣Hi, Ryoka, well, THAT I call a mobile kitchen...So it can move, too. Maybe to your new or another place. Happy moving, I'm looking forward to more videos. Never seen somebody working so thoughtful, in the kitchen or during construction. Or deconstruction;-). Love from Germany, Monika❣
High quality ASMR
You look so relaxed, i would be crying.. :’( not good at goodbyes!
i love this channel so much and i'm excited to see where the move takes you! good luck!
the way he ends the video is so funny asdfhkl he literally ended it without giving any sh*t (feels bad for cursing on your channel)
Make a video about next kitchen setup xD
You taking that kitchen apart made me so sad. Your kitchen had become a familiar place to all of us. Hoping to see you create a new kitchen and uploading more videos soon. Love.
WHAT'S THAT SOUNDPROOF ROOM SO COOL I WANT ONE😭😭😭
急上昇おめ
Sad to leave a place that you have put so much effort and with so much memories. All the best to your exciting new page of life.
Will you build a new kitchen in the new place? I'd love to see that!
妊婦さん？
OMG I love how you do the kitchen without any nails on the wall. I'm not sure how many are as amazed by this like me but yeah....it does give me awesome ideas on doing the kitchen.

And the island made of three cabinets.....awesome.
I will miss the old kitchen. It was lovely. Excited to see your new one! More videos please!
WOAH I NEVER KNEW THAT WAS REMOVABLE WALLPAPER, Also I feel like the space is smaller when you move everything.
Looking forward to see the new place. That screwdriver is pretty impressive too. Especially when taking the huge table apart. Wondered which brand is that.
It's just recall back when the time you move out from the cosy and warm house to this house.
Times fry, and is a great time to move again. 
'Jia you' from Malaysia.
what is that metal foot thing for the 2x4 that's used at 5:20 to prop it up against the wall???
Would love to hear your cello playing....i adore the sound of the cello.....no wonder you are a peaceful soul
かわいい腕時計ですね(^p^)！！
The way you built your kitchen, gave me ideas for mine.  Very good luck in your new home!♥♥♥
Sooo, we still good for dinner? :3
I'm gonna pin this - This really gave me a lot of ideas how to get a nice, but cheap, kitchen, you can easily DIY, and it doesn't even have to ruin the walls with screwing. Thank you! :)
holy crap. i thought you were closing the channel down. huff
勿体ない…大好きなキッチン❣️出来上がりの動画も良かったけど、消滅動画も観てて楽しいです(*´꒳`*)
I was shocked when I saw him rip off the wallpaper. I really thought that was real
You're amazing!!
What an exciting moment for you. Hope your new place is just as great or greater.  Hope you do a video on your new place...
Oh goodness I didn’t know the wonderful ness of bubble wrap being cut up
Might I ask what are the hardwares you use to put under the 2x4 used to build your false walls? I think that's a great idea!
I'm not crying, you are! ( ･ั﹏･ั)
Look forward to see the new kitchen and lovely place but miss this one too 😥♡♡♡
sending some love from russia)) you're a wonderful human!!
Amazing how you dismantled your kitchen/house and there was no damage done to the apartment. Bet your landlord aporeciates that! Would love to see a video of you playing the cello. Good luck with your new house.
It is so heartbreaking😟
top 10 saddest anime parting
everything in this channel is so peaceful and satisfying
The kitchen you built, its kinda ☹️ but change is good 😊
When he took off the top board and moved the counters, I started laughing.
Apart from making these videos, what exactly do you do for a living?
Aku akan kangen dengan dapur ini....
Good luck moving to your new home! I hope everything goes well!
待ってました！！！！！！！、！！！！！！！！
歯医者行ってらっしゃい！
I'm just amaze with the way you put those wooden platform on your wall without even drilling holes on the real wall...
so many life hacks 😭i felt bamboozled when he peeled that wall paper off
Even Japan has a cute panda mascot in their moving boxes (:
I'm Gonna mis that place xD
Omg i loved your kitchen, but i bet your new one will be just as good! I love your videos!💕
As long as you promise to continue making videos 🙃
壁板を止めるネダは突っ張ってるだけなのですね、すごい！
if i had ordered a soundproof room i will definitely had a visit from the SWAT or FBI
well.. he do lot "giveaway" tho..
寂しい…（ ; ; ）でも次があるってことだから楽しみ(o^^o)
解体した木材はまた新しい新居で使いますかー？
寂しいけどお引越し楽しみ！
you had me at the panda moving box
Maan, I'm moving this month too. Wish I had the bubble wrap (or where to buy it here).
後ろの壁の感じが大好きでした❗だから、動画見ながら真似して作ろうと思ってます❗
Whoa, this is a sad moment. But I wish you good fortune on your next home!
Wow..... it’s amazing to see how you removed everything without making a single hole in the walls and how the soundproof room being taken away without a trace. I think all these happens only in Japan. I am always awed by how Japanese execute everything with meticulous attention to detail. Thanks for uploading this video, it sure opens up my eyes!
Oh my...you're s genius! I know this is so simple but if you consider that designer kitchens are so expensive and you just took three of those with a wooden top. That's definitely going into my apartment planing. I love your Ideas.
あららら
大好きなキッチンが、、
初めて見たときこのキッチンに感動した覚えがあります。

（涙）
素敵なキッチンだったのに!!!なんか寂しい(＞＜。)
県外に引越しなさるんですか？
Big congrats on the move! I'll miss seeing this kitchen in your videos but I also can't wait to see how you would set up your next one ^^
You work so hard, nice job
Please share with us for your new place. Sad to see your kitchen gone but looking forward to see your new place !
Congratulations on your new home! Sad to see all this beautiful furniture go but I’m glad it’s being reused or given to other people. Can’t wait to see what you do in the future ٩( 'ω' )و
My heart sunk.. I thought you were quitting. If you are just moving, I will be OK.
Please give us a tour of your new place. 🤓
Being a kitchen person, it took me 1 week just to clear my kitchen. I want to keep everything and bring to my house. But it's just too much.
your  so awesome.. i hope that i can see u real life...
終わり方😂😂
歯医者行ってきます。（笑）
うちのキッチンはここの模倣なので、少し寂しいです。
いざ自分で作ってみると、このキッチンにいかにお金がかかっていたか分かりました。杉古材を買えなかったので、実家の雪囲い用杉板を使ったことを思い出します。
そんな高価なものをポンと人にあげてしまう太っ腹ぶりに感心です d=(^o^)=b
新しいキッチンのDIY動画も楽しみにしてます！
Every time I see this channel,I think that he lives so mindfulness.I wanna live like him.
The soundproof room is awesome! Where did you get it?
On to bigger and better places and things. I hope all goes well!
I remember when you moved in there and you started your kitchen and built everything... yeah ive been following you for a lonnngggg time. I always loved the DIY videos as much as recipes. Cant wait to see what you build in your new place! お疲れ様です！！ 👍
IM SAAAD. BUT HAPPY. BUT SAD TOO. I’M GOING TO MISS THIS PLACE.
Good luck moving out and settling in!! But are you still gonna do cooking videos?
以前部屋が暗いと仰っていましたが白い壁が出てきた途端明るくなりましたね！
もしかしてDIYのせいだったり・・・笑
新しい部屋楽しみです！
You are so sweet, and energetic man.
舞台裏がこうなっていたとは
面白い
❣Hi, Ryoka, THAT I call a mobile kitchen. So it can move, too. Maybe to your new or another place. Happy moving, looking forward to more videos. Never seen somebody working so thoughtful, in the kitchen or during construction. Or deconstruction;-). Love from Germany, Monika❣
NOOOOOOO 😢😢😢😢!!!!!!   oh, you're just moving!!!  okay, Looking forward to seeing your new kitchen!  👍👍👍👍
どちらに引っ越しされるんですか？遠方ですか？
I feel like I'm moving too! Wish I could help 🤔
I just subscribed this channel, things are going to be familiar already, and then I found this video :(
when you set up again in new place please make video! i loved this one :) sad for you to be moving, but glad because it means new opportunities!
寂しいですね...

新居でもキッチンのDIY動画出るの楽しみにしています^ ^
引っ越す動画でもこんなにオシャレになるってすげえ…
なぜ、今の地域に住んでらっしゃるのか不思議でした。
もう少し空港アクセスの良いところに住むのでしょうか？？
Missing in anticipation your fantastic kitchen. But already ready to be amazed by your new kitchen.
A great model of organization ... Congratulations and good luck in your new home :)
センスいいですね～～
マンションの一室とは、思いませんでした
Truly Heartbreaking vdo.
自分の世界は自分で作るものなんだなって感動しました
This was my favourite kitchen....
このキッチンが見れないのは少し寂しいですね…
また新たなスタートを楽しみにしています！
I panicked! But then i saw the bubble wrap and i felt so relieved! Glad to see you’re moving to a new place that’s going to make more memories and videos 💛
Will you make a new house tour video ? Congratulations on the new house by the way :)
次のハウスメイクも楽しみにしています！
W....Why?? Will you let go of such wonderful furniture?
I'm going to miss that kitchen so much, please take care when moving and don't hurt yourself. Please take care!! 💚💚💚💚💚
You scared me! But now I am excited to see what you have planned next! :)
So where is your next destination :-)?
また引越しですか？
最近レシピ動画が上がらず少し寂しいです。
気長にレシピ動画待っています。
I'm looking forward to seeing the new atmosphere! ^ ^ good luck moving out! がんばて！
(@5:20) Does anyone know what the name of the metal clamp thingy used to hold the wood panel upright? It would be much appreciated
I don't know I just feed sad~~ hope that in your new place u will keep playing cello and doing DIY stuff
お久しぶりですー！💕
これだけの物持ちなのに、自力で片付けるのはすごい...
That's an amazing amount of work for one day. I bet he slept so well that night
I always thought his table was a solid piece of wood not cabinets put together with wood on top, it’s a great idea tho!
懐かしぁ〜(*´ω｀*)
so neat. I am in love
The cute boxes with the little pandas on them 😍😍 I want one! Also as much as this kitchen will be missed can't wait to see you make videos in your new kitchen (and maybe a home tour video will happen?) ❤
It seemed like just yesterday I was watching you build this kitchen, sad to see it go. Looking forward to seeing your new kitchen!!
سوف أشتاق لهذا المكان
Omygosh I was afraid it got destroyed by fire or something!!
Safe moving, hope to see your vid soon.
great stuff, Love from Bristol, England
the most peaceful house moving ever.
what do you call that fixture at 5:20 ? Also wishing you all the best in your new place!
I have a question. How did you build that accent wall without damaging your wall without the studs being drilled into the  original wall? I was kind of curious as i watched this video. I wanted to do this in my apartment. I hope you can help. Love your videos and thanks!
寂しい(´･ω･｀)
ベットは作んないですけど のとこ面白い笑笑
Japanese are so great
Wow... I didn't know you can install walls like that! That wall paper was so easy to take off too!
期待再次看見你的影片
[Looking forward to seeing your video again]
Weeeew cello. I love cello.
A lots of memory of this kitchen .Thanks for your video .We will miss that
このキッチン好きだったから淋しいし、もったいないなと思うけど、新しいお家もオシャレで素敵でしたね。いつでも素敵です。
最後突然の「歯医者行ってきます」www
I'm a little sad to see this lovely kitchen go, but excited to see you put together your new one. Hope the move goes smoothly!
when he took the brickwork above the wood, i thought it was actual brick, he tore it out like a sticker !!
Ill miss your kitchen.😔
I love how the box has a cute little panda
Will miss this kitchen. But I'm excited to see the new one 😀 Happy moving!
It is sad to see the studio be removed, yet I'm fascinated see how you created the decorative paneling without damaging the walls in the apartment. Even while disassembling the set, you still provide a practical information.
タイトルww
キッチン消滅www
Thats a lot of work holy crap lol thats a really cool and creative space you created though
ハワイに住んだりして。好きな事好きなだけやって欲しいです。
Why do i'm feeling sad :(
Aaaa ok found the answer (^.*) Must watch more of your videos. Very very new to your channel 😊
I cant wait for new place set up 😍
💚💚💚 Love from Belgium💚💚💚

ご結婚に伴う引越しかな？
キッチン、作るところから見てたので、少しさみしいですねー
omg i didn’t realise the kitchen island was just three drawers with a wooden plank on top
🖤❤️🖤
工エｴェｪ(´д｀)ｪェｴエ工もう引っ越すのぉ？あのキッチンよかったのにぃ(´；ω；`)新居動画はよ頼みますｗ
りょうやさんの知り合いになりたい(笑)
動画でたくさん作られたスイーツ等いくらでも食べます(笑)

相模原から京都ですかね？同じ相模原市民としては悲しい。
なんか引っ越しって感傷的になるね！
I would like to be your friend... ;-) hope for next stories from your new kitchen :-D
6:39 MY LIFE IS A LIE
Don’t stop making peaceful cuisine!
新しい家でまたdiyするのかな？
楽しみです！！
ってか防音室いいですねw
いいえ！私の心が痛いです！(╥_╥)
I'll miss your old kitchen :( It gave me a lot of beautiful memories :(
I never clicked so fast...
あげちゃうなんてもったいないですね！
引っ越したら部屋の紹介して欲しい❗
i love how there was no damage left on the walls and everything else omg
i hope it all goes smoothly 👌
I love your channel keep it up
Wish you all the best in your new city and new house (and kitchen!). You worked so hard and deserve going on to better things. And I, as most of us, will be grateful for sharing the making of your new kitchen and all the future recipes you will teach us from it.
Who's that woman who helped you out at the end of the video? Is she your girlfriend/wife? Are you moving in together? 😍
:O it feels like just yesterday I saw your vids of putting this kitchen + tables together. Good luck moving!
He giving all his stuff away to his friends, but hes doing all this work by himself ☹️☹️☹️☹️
Good luck with moving
もしももしも調理器具など手放そうと思っているのあれば譲ってほしいです。
Growth is good, congratulations our dear one
You should use a classic drill ans not an impulse one. Impulse drill is only meant to screwdrive
Good luck with the move!
So sad...but good luck! 🍀🐞
I came across your vids few decades ago. I was having so much stress from work (I was a college teacher who handled culinary arts) and my stress-reliever was watching cooking vids, and I saw yours. It was relaxing as heck!!! I didn't know it was ASMR. I LOVED THAT KITCHEN. 😢 Welp. Wherever you're going, please take me with you. Marry me. Lemme just slide that down shamelessly. Haha! I mean, if you're down for that really.😋 😅 This is embarassing. Okaybye 😂😂😂❤
この時の家が一番いい。
歯医者行ってきますwww
Can't wait to see your new kitchen!
なんか寂しいな、、
Good luck god man 🤗
おおー！ すっきりしちゃいましたね！！？
Are you getting married?? :D
but why Ryoya, why are you moving? 🤔
please show us how you built your new kitchen!!!
I read the title and I had a mini panic attack
Wow, your friend is lucky for all that stuff
You even dismantle things so neatly 😢
Oh my, I don't think I've seen someone move out - even dismantling a whole kitchen! - without leaving a mess in the process. So much respect for your skills. :O
Omg but you worked so hard into building this!!!!! Nooooo!!!! 😭😭😭
Sad and interesting watching you take it all down.
Its bittersweet I've always loved your kitchen it was beautiful but i cant wait to see the new place
Aww Ryoya-san... We will all miss this space and how you gave us a tour of the kitchen, how everything was so organised. But very happy for you because you're growing as an entrepreneur and your franchisee is growing. Our Ryoya-sama needs a big place now! We hope you will have a biiiiig kitchen garden this time. Always supporting Peaceful Cuisine!! Love, from India.
The removable wall paper shocked me at first. Thought he was gonna take his tool and pull the bricks apart bit by bit. So when he yanked the wallpaper, I couldn't understand what was going on. 😝 Nonetheless I am gonna miss this familiar quaint kitchen.
Health and a wealth of happiness! Miles of smiles...
Wishing you all the best in your new home. It made me feel a bit melancholy seeing you dismantle your kitchen, but I'm in complete awe of your DIY skills. It's so satisfying to see you doing these projects with so much grace. I hope that your move goes smoothly. Cheers!
im always want to say this "PLEASE MARRY ME"😆😆😆
I never expect those things are able to be disassembled again. Wow just wow.
You never upload these days
おつかれさまです。
いっぱいの思い出を作ってくれた場所が少しずつ消えていくのを見て少し寂しい気分になりました
これまでお世話になりました。ありがとう😊
Ryoya! A little sad about the old kitchen, but I’m stoke to see the new place and the new kitchen you have in store for us. Much love ❤️
THE MEMORIES:"(
The end of an era...
You Japanese are used to not show emotions... too bad sometimes!
Soo...where are you movin too?
Wow never thought about that metod to not drill holes in the wall, very clever!!
家をたてたんですか？
マイフォーム
自分で建てたっぽいきがします
When he peeled off that removable wall paper, I was fooled lol
Goodluck on you new place. Will you have another concept/theme for your new kitchen?
wow I'm gonna miss the old kitchen but I am so excited to see the new one!!!
Hope you find a new place to make more food!
Going to dentist?! 😂 😂 😂
Even when dismantling things he’s still so organized 😭 what am i doing with my life
OMG SO ORGANIZED!!!
I feel you are living Japan
We miss you so much!
I wish there was someone to help you ;w; Damn, this isn't even my house but i really wished you let the wood planks stay. They add so much character for just normal slacks of wood, seeing you take them down to a bare wall made me die a little on the inside... And, i didn't know you played cello, that's so cool to me) Good luck on your journeys 🌸🍀 おめでとうございます！🎉 🌺
Such a shame! :(( I'll totally miss the kithen.
歯医者行く時間あるんですか笑
So... that sadness your kitchen was very very beautyfull... the changes are god... they say
I hope your moving goes well! :3
rest in peace...ful cuisine! haha... ha 
i regret nothing
I need to deal with my memories. I adored this kitchen. I hope everything's well with your moving. Can't wait to see what's next!
When he ripped off the wallpaper I just gasp actually gasped. I thought it was actual like rock thingies
WHY MOVE...
Pleaso do new kitchen and house tour 😄 oh yeah and new recipe too 😉
so relaxing ahhh thank you
I'd forgotten how clever your setup was! Will you be doing a diy video for your new home? It sounds like you don't have to worry about neighbors, at all.
Such a huge work 👏
I wanna move into your new kitchen :-)
cant wait to see the new place :-)
手慣れてるなぁ！！
前の家からみてたので、引っ越し時期なのかって感じですね
I'm going to miss your kitchen or your house.. It's such a nice house.. Good luck on moving!
Wow! Thank you for sharing so much of your life.  I have learned so much about many things watching your videos.  Would you tell what those tension supports placed underneath the wood framing on the walls are called?  Thank you for showing how you did it. Now I know how to make my place the way I want it without damaging the walls.
I hope you will have a bigger apartment!
I love everything about this video! Not really sure why
clean wall q.q
I hope you had a good move and are in good shape after so much work!
この見慣れたキッチンともさよならですか…なんか寂しいですね…(；＿；)
何の仕事やられてるんですか？お金持ちがすごい
The end was perfect.
Sei fantastico ti ammiro un sacco
Im going to miss your kitchen, 😨 watching you removing all the parts makes me sad but i know you will gonna be alright with your new home kitchen.. a new homey place to start another life.. all the best for you!
oh the bubble tea
This guy has too much patience.
お久しぶりです！
The end HAHAH
寂しいけど、また新しい所で、キッチンとか作っていくんだとしたら凄い楽しみ。
this tittle is so click bait :)))
感觉学到了好多
it's beautiful how you set up your kitchen, there were no damages done to the apt itself. the break down video is visually pleasing.
明日からモコｽﾞキッチンどーすんだ
I always did wonder if the kitchen was in your home or your cafe! So cool and creative 😍
i was honestly confused to find out this was his kitchen, i thought it was a cafe he worked at or something. truly an end to an era. Best wishes to your future
Your kitchen setup is so elaborate. I like how you made your own little island with the counters. Honestly, Peaceful Cuisine? You've inspired me to do some of my own cooking, haha. I wish you all the best with your move and hope that packing went well :) I look forward to your future videos.
最近、いかにすごしてるのー？
わ～。。
この素敵な壁、いつかまねしたいな～と思ってたんですが、
もうお引越ししてしまったんですね。
サクサクスピーディで要領も抜群ですね。
Good luck in the new kitchen ...... 👍I’m waiting for your new video 😻
Love..... 😊
You should take your friend to help you mister.
5:01 made me really nervous...
歯医者のオチにちょっと笑ってしまった。
two years, two years i've been following you and your kitchen. making all those walls, tables and racks, and even bicycle rack, if i remember? two years have gone so fast. now you're moving on to new place, walking up new goals and even will meet new people. i'm so proud of you. you probably already moving to your new place when you uploaded this video, but have you said "good bye properly to this apartment? i hope you did :)
I love the cliff hanger
次のキッチンがどんなものになるのか楽しみ。
全部もらえる友達が羨ましい！！！
今度はどんな感じになるのか楽しみ:)
Nice renovation
Make sure your new kitchen is even better!!!!
I just watched your videos on making the shelves and table for this kitchen a while ago, and now i'm watching you tear it down. I don't know what to do with these emotions.....
寂しいですねぇ。
ちょうどりょうやさんの動画に出会った頃にこのキッチンのdiy動画も上がっていて、どんどん色んなものが追加されていくのを楽しみに観ていたのを思い出します。
新しいスタジオからの動画も楽しみにしています！
Who's screaming when Ryoya-san turn around to camera (us) in the beginning video ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ
Wait you play the cello? I’ve always wanted to but I play violin.
WAIT I DIDNT KNOW YOU PLAYED A BASS
This helps me learn Japanese
Moving is never fun, but it is a good opportunity to purge.
Yo i thought that was real stone the whole time
This video made me cry
that mini soundproof room is so cool :o
くいじんさーん
見てますよ。
まぁ、次のおうちは今のおうちとは違う間取りだろうし
いやぁしかし、あげちゃうのかぁ…
なんかとてもさみしい気持ちです😭次のお家も楽しみにしています！ぜひルームツアーして下さい！
Aw we will miss seeing the kitchen. Good luck with the new place
Your training in construction comes in handy!!!
i'll miss this place :')
So I guess you're not a minimalist?
hello attractive man
最後に出てきた女性は奥さん？彼女さん？
引越し大変だなー
Good luck.
引っ越すんですね
ビックリしました
新居でもハワイで買ってきたナイフで動画あげてくださいね💕
Удачи!😘😘😘
I felt sad watching this video
ベッドは作らないですけど、に笑ってしまった。
寂しいですねー💦
Are you moving to a smaller house to embrace minimalism?
これをもらえる知り合い...羨ましい...w
I just moved to recently from a small apartment to a bigger one and its fricking mendokusai.and seeing you move that big room all by yourself it must be pretty hard..cheers mate 頑張って😁
I'm happy for you!
I'm moving as well!
i dont remember subbing
えーなくなるん！？
Sooo loved the kitchen and all of the DIYs that went into making it.  Onward and upward for new a new journey in a new space!
We look forward to more eye-catching new kitchens and better cooking! 頑張って！ずっと応援します！
I watched you build this and it's still as entertaining watching you dismantle everything.
この空間で作業される姿を見るのがとても好きだったので寂しさもありますが、次のお部屋がとっっっても楽しみです(^^)
ぜひまた動画で見たいですっ❤︎❤︎
Please marry me?
The title gave me a heart attack!!!
anyone have the urge to pop the bubble wrap like me lol
btw you will still practice cello right?? you don't need the sound proof room cuz you're moving to a place where you don't need it, not cuz you're ganna stop playing?
Wow! I love how you disassembled your kitchen. You didn’t do any destructive connections to the wall. It’s all clean :o
Sad to see that amazing kitchen go! But I’m sure your new place will be just as beautiful!
Wow it's amazing how many things u put together to make up this kitchen 😶❤️
It was nice knowing you, kitchen. But at least some parts of it is going to a nice, new homes. Wonder how your new kitchen will look like.
うん、ですよねー
中央のテーブル、どう考えても運び込めないサイズですからね〜やっぱりバラバラでしたか〜
Omggggggg I hope you have a successful move!
WHAT THE ROCKS WERENT REAL
解体してもせまい。
Whyyyyy 😭
まじか！   次の動画が楽しみだよ！
終わりに歯医者行きますって言った？w廃棄します？
such a jack of all trade guy
I was sad when I saw the kitchen counter in pieces the videos of making that counter top was the first video I saw on the channel
Are you showing us your new place? I wished to see a  Japanese house nowadays.
Good luck!
Wow, that was a lot of hard work and then you had a dentist appointment? I would've just crashed on the mattress and napped for 2 hours.
I want to live there! Such a nice apartment.
PUT SOME SHOES, YOU MIGHT HURT YOURSELF
あぁやっぱり寂しい！ このキッチンのDIY動画大好きなので、何もない状態に戻っていく様は寂しいですね。でも、新しいお住いでもきっとDIYされるんだろうなーしてほしいなーきっとするに違いない！そしてまたキッチンツアーしてくださるに違いない！と勝手にワクワクもしています(笑) お引越し先からの動画楽しみにしております♪
Omg it's been a while
How 😭😭
all the effort omg
Kitchen : "Mr. Ryo, I dont feel so good.."
That title almost killed me
引っ越しセンターの段ボール(笑)
ここのキッチンの設置動画をオンタイムでみてたのでなんだか感慨深いです…！これからも動画たのしみにしています！
Why people have to dislike this video for what valid reason ?
Me encanta tu cocina realmente se consigue  paz ahi
What a great idea for an island!
Why are you moving Ryoya?
Ooops!!! my bad.
Congratulation!
りょうやさんのことなので
次のおうちも素敵なんだろーなー

キッチンの作り方動画は見ましたが
本当に床や天井に跡は残らなかったん
でしょうか？気になります…(´･ω･`)
引っ越しするんですね！勝手に名残惜しい笑
ハワイ島の噴火は大丈夫でしたか？
This was sad for some reason. This is not the end right?
I thought the channel was closing for a second. Whew. Can’t wait until you settle in and start doing some more things!!!
Do yo do all this work  by yourself ?
賃貸？でこんなにDIYできるとは！壁に穴をあけずにここまで楽しめるんだね😃
もったいない…
Where are you move to?
6:40 Was not expecting that
ここに来られたのは約3年前ですかね〜
日当たりが良くて、Ryoyaさんが作る料理の色が凄く綺麗に出るので
私も大好きな部屋でした😁

新天地で、レシピ動画でなくとも
今のRyoyaさんの食に対する考えが聞けたら良いなって勝手に思っています。
Have a great move~!
Going to dentist😂
Peaceful Moving get it?
くいじんさーん
見てますか？
Welcome back.
Please make Indonesian food 😀
Did you do all that wood work and styling on the wall yourself? It's impressive
すごいお金かかるんですね〜
Why???
the “bricks”-
まあ．．．ちょっと悲しいなぁ・・・
I really love your way building your home. Feel so cozy and peaceful. Hope you set up new kitchen soon and record it.
Good job ! 😘
That’s crazy. I am impressed by how you completely transformed the kitchen to look like that. Cool!
ハワイにしかない包丁なんでしょうか?😬✨すごい斑模様！
love your videos! A good idea and more sustainable, when moving, is to use old newspapers to put your china, glasses, jars, etc, that way you dont need to buy or use plastic for it.
Wish you peace and luck in your new chapter my friend. I will miss your beautiful self made kitchen.
awwww goodbye old kitchen were gonna miss youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ToT ToT!!
goddammmnnn he's the typa guy i like :')
前のお部屋から継続？らしきカウンターテーブルやスパイスラックも手放される、ということはいよいよお家丸ごとセルフリノベですかね？w
りょーやさんのDIY動画も料理と同じくテキパキしてて見ていて気持ちいいので大好きです。
引っ越し先での作業動画もお待ちしてます！
寂しい…😭
凄く素敵なキッチンだっただけに勿体ないし寂しいですね…
でもりょうやさんなら次はもっと素敵なキッチンを作るだろうから､そのキッチンでも動画ＵＰしてもらえたら嬉しいです！
あと話変わるけど､そのBGM曲すっごい好き！
ひよこ豆の味噌の動画で流れてたのを視てからずっとお気に入りの曲になってます｡
WHAT
This was so nice to watch. Looking forward to seeing your new kitchen when you move into the new place!
Man, you took all of that down very quickly and efficiently! Meanwhile, I'm dreading having to put my clothes away from the dryer -_-
Non attachment is peace
Going to the dentist? ! LOL
You're moving in with me, right?! <:
2
Who are YOU???
Aw i love this kitchen, i will miss the vibes huhu
Can't wait for new videos in new kitchen
ちょっくいじんさーんってばよ
補強の金具は内側にしたほうが危なくないですね☀手すって怪我するひとも多いので。
its so weird to see him break it down because I remember when I saw him first put it up
❤️
Amo ❤️
なんだか寂しい。心がザワザワする動画
寂しいですね
急上昇おめでとうございます
I’m sure I speak for a lot of people that was a really nice kitchen
Where are u going
Panicked for a sec there
次は英語でコメントできるよう語学力を上げたいけれど……
「あらか！」「むしゃこいしゃ」「難しかと」……佐賀弁のスキルが↑↑(笑)

お引っ越しなのですね！

お料理の動画、続けてくださいね、楽しみにしています！
Make me panic why dont cha
淋しい
Title almost gave me a heartattack
これは今日中には終われない
i wonder what his new kitchen will look like?
It's amazing how there's not a speck of dust, even under the kitchen's counters. I'll never be as clean as this.
I remember you stating in an old video it was your goal to eventually move out. I know how stressful it is to move, and I wish you all the luck and happiness in the world. We will miss you, here, but we all want you happy. Thank you for everything you gave us in this place. It's meant so much. I hope you keep posting your delicious recipes.
ボンド固定したダボ、どうするのか気になってたのですごくためになりました。
☺️
Oh wow
😢
👌
ちょっとさみしい
Cant wait to see what you do to the new place.
I physically gasped when I saw this
👌👍😜
Wow it is really sad to see this that all of your item with this fimiliar thing just move away but i am glad to see all the thing u do have done and moving to a new space,all the best to you and hopefully im looking forward for your new vlog with the new space
😢
I love your videos.
I watched you put all that together, so sad to see it go, all so beautiful. But on to the next chapter....... can’t wait too see what’s next for you.
お引越しするんですね！
新しい家はもっと広いのかな..?
おすすめにキッチン作るときの動画出てきて懐かしいな〜もう一回見ようかな〜って思ってチャンネル来たら解体されてた…すごくさみしい……
Korea No.1
3:32 My life has been a lie.
🎉🎆 Love and hugs.
Why is this so saaad hahaha
I wish I could Adult as well as this dude adults
Where?
Wow I didn’t realise you have a HUGE kitchen!
ハワイ島へ行っていたんですね。
噴火が止まらず、家や、自然を飲み込んでいますね。
動画がなかなかアップされないので、気になっていました。 
手際よく引っ越しできて、新居もいろんな事を発想していると思うので、楽しみにしています。
Ahhhh.... I'm gonna miss this kitchen a lot...
コーヒー豆とか入れてる栓がコルク状の入れ物はどこに売ってますか？？
Wow, did you build the kitchen yourself? What can't you do? 😀
😯
I’m surprised the kitchen dissembles pretty easily
Wonderful channel
ひっこしさきではDDIYしますか
What are the things called you used at the end of the wooden bars for your wooden wall? The things you use to tighten the bars with between the ceiling and floor?
Hello. Can you please explain how you built that timber wall without damaging the apartment ? It would be very useful for other people who rent and can’t drill directly into the wall.
Thank you for your beautiful videos!
すごいDIY!でキッチンが作られていたのですね。その逆の解体を見せて頂き感動です。公開された時間が僕が今まで観た動画の中で一番最近の物ですね。高橋さんに近づけた感覚です。不思議です。です。今後の展開も期待しています。
Where are you moving to?
Where you go
Cool knives. Who are they by?
Will there be a tour of the new place?
自分もディアウォールで板を貼ろうと思っているのですが、取り外しにかかった時間はどれくらいでしょうか？
なるほど、また引っ越しシーズンに入るって事ですか~お身体に気をつけながら頑張ってください^_^いつも面白く拝見させて頂いてます！
why?
マットレスは引っ越し先に届けてもらえばらくだったかも。今までお布団だったんですね。引っ越し大変そうですが、前回のお引越しの時のように、壁に穴とかついてないので、いいですね！　あ、関西人が大好きな「勉強しまっせ引っ越しの～さかい、ほんま～かいなそうかいな～」作るのは楽しいけれど、解体するのはさびしいですね。
Wow!
Wait, your apartment has a kitchen, but you built your own second kitchen right next to it? That's like grade-A baller status.
Oh wow I can’t believe how it was before. Can’t wait to see your new creative kitchen!
マチサガの伝説のキッチン消滅かよ…
いやミッパラとりょうやさんのギャップ有り過ぎたし、ハワイとかサンフランシスコとかシアトルとかがふさわしい。
モーリンデッキとかその他もろもろのマチサガの思い出が終わりを遂げるのか…グランベリーパークに店出して欲しかったわ…
dude, did you plan the kitchen yourself or did someone do it for you
That’s a nice house tho
退屈にならない解体動画
さみしいなぁ
包丁メーカーってなんてゆーメーカーですか？
Wow that was a really cool kitchen. Did you build it yourself?
Hi Ryoya. Impressed with the design of not drilling into the walls. What do you call those side plank you remove with bolt(5:19)? Thanks.
Cool jeans!
who is that girl??
Sudden dentist appointment
😕
Who is that woman over there?
また引っ越すの？
These are all such great ideas to make a rental place feel like home! Where did you get the ideas? Or did you come up with them yourself?
キッチン解体動画、、、！
いつか来ると思ってたけど、思ってたより早くてビックリ。
寂しい気持ちもあるけど、次のキッチンが楽しみでワクワクしている気持ちの方が強いかな。
このキッチンから生まれた料理の数々、楽しませてもらった動画の数々、いつも参考にさせてもらってます。
これからもたくさんの美味しい料理と素敵な動画を楽しみにしています。
歯医者から帰ってきた後の動画も楽しみにしています。
あと、顔が少し痩せました？
1:32 Why are you not going to need that room any more?
The end of an era. I got quite upset seeing the kitchen being dismantled as this is where all that magic happened. But, can’t wait to see the next chapter. Peace x
What are the silver things at 5:20 ? o:
I thought it was over! I’m so happy it’s not.
But you are going to make videos in the future? :)
While I am enjoying this video..my mind is full of questions!! Why are you moving out? Where to next? Did I miss an episode in between? :) Please share, if possible.
お引っ越し、おつかれ様です！　わたしも来年引っ越し予定なので、キッチン（部屋）作り＆解体、とても参考になりました。手間ひまかけて自分らしい部屋を作っていこうと思います！　新しいお城をどうしつらえるか楽しみです :)　ぜひ動画にしてくださいね！
今日DIY動画を探してこのカウンターをつくられた映像を見て
そこからレシピ動画も色々見て、
そしたら解体してて…

ダボ打ちでマメができてたのに
それを削って…

寂しい…
Can’t wait to see what you create next! Like this a lot!
So that’s how Ayano got the peaceful cuisine kitchen. I see. Was this awhile ago? :/
I thought something bad happened!!!!!! Lol but best wishes on your moving process. No one likes it lol
T T
Awee~~ i'll miss this setting. Pls show us your new kitchen soon and if possible do a house/apt tour 😄😄😄 as always, you did an amazing job clearing out the kitchen 👏👏👏👏
This made me a little sad . . . I recall how much care you put into making the kitchen your own style.  I wish you an easy moving time and good fortune in the next steps you take!
なるほど。壁に穴を開けず壁面をアレンジしていたのですね！
Whoooaaaaaa!!!! First comment. Good luck in your new place! Cannot wait to see more!
Looks like quite capable of engineering staff, brilliant guy!
I was so scared !! But CONGRATS ! :)
ネジ隠すのにダボを打つとその後分解するのにとても手間がかかるので、僕は隠せる場所にネジを打つようにしてます。
それか、敢えてネジの頭を見せることでそれをアクセントにして無骨さをだすようにしてます(・∀・)
ベッド、売ってないとこに越すの？
I dont get this guy... isn't a vegan lifestyle to be anti-materialistic, healthy and environmental-friendly?? Why do you need a new kitchen, why drink coffee that beans are getting shipped across the globe?   Why roast your own beans when a factory is more economical doing it in big scale? .....

I don't get people. They think this lifestyle is "good" because it is healthy and has this fresh image with a little tip of Japanese fake zen cultur, but the amount of products he uses and needs is far from honorable. 

彼は自分のことを考えった方がいいな。。。
It hurts, just to mutch plastic waste...
Oh it's been so long. Welcome back.
Ryoya-san!!! Where have you been???? What are you doing these days? We miss your cooking videos! 😭😭
Congratulations on your merchandise! I hope it goes very well for you ^o^
glad to see you back.  the apron looks really nice.  but you forgot to put it on and model it for us.  I would love to see how it wears. 😃
凄いね〜 I bought it before watching the video. Lol. I love the idea of a towel apron, especially since I live with a feisty puppy (秋田子犬) who runs off with the hand towels I normally use. I live in Japan and like to support domestic products whenever I can. 😄 宜しくお願いします！
We've missed you! :)
ほんと高すぎ！！！
I've ordered one! 
Can't wait to use it.
- A fan from Australia :)
WE ALL MISS YOUR VIDEOSSS 😭
エプロン、とってもよさそうなのですが、つけているところを見られたらイメージが湧くと思いました。あと使ってみた具体的な感想とか。
Long time no see!!!　　エプロン　素敵なんですが、、女性が着けると、ポッケの位置が心配です。RYOYAさん　細身といえども　男性だし　女性はウエストで絞めるでしょ・・
三色買いましたー！地元今治タオルの良さを知っているし、しかも、りょーやさんのファンなので、到着楽しみです！
I was just watching you last day in Norway and thinking it has been a while since you put a video up... yay. Ohayou from Ireland +peacefulcuisine
今治出身なので本当に嬉しいです
女性の試着写真も欲しかったです。
紐がタオル生地なのでバスローブっぽく見えてしまいました。

タオル生地のエプロンはとても良いと思うので、再販は無いとの事ですが、改善されれば購入したいなと思いました。
赤が可愛い
タオル地いいですよね
洗えるし手も拭ける
Just seeing you smile make me want to smile too :">
（まず、風呂上りｽｯﾊﾟで巻き...たい!)小声
I'm learning Japanese but they're speaking wayyyyy too fast, so arigato for the subtitles!
ここは商売の場か？
りょうやさんはエプロンしないもんね。
0:28
 I didn't see that the video was 12 minutes long so when he said bye 30 seconds into the video I was like "wait what that's it? 😧" 

Touche Ryoya, touche.
Wow! You're such a productive guy. All the best 👍
I love the products!! And grey is my favourite!!!! Congratulations!!
thumbs up for the "just kidding." 😅 you got me
欲しいけどちょっとお高い・・・
I missed your videos. Thank Thank you so much for uploading and i will definitely check out your website. Looking forward to watching more of your great videos, keep up the great work
りょうやさん、初めてコメント致します<(_ _)>
りょーやさんの動画が大好きでプレイリストを作っていつも見ています。
このエプロンの赤が欲しくて注文したかったのですが...
今日、6月1日に注文しようとしたら...5月31日までだったのですね？
とても残念です😭😢😢

それから、ずっと質問したかった事。
＊お水はどんなお水を使われていますか？
＊木製スプーン等のメーカーを教えて下さい🙏

動画を見ていていつも思うのですが、動画の最後にりょーやさんが食しているところを見せて下さったら、味や食感を想像しやすくなると思います。

あ～...(＞＜)
エプロン残念でした。
是非、再販を...お願いします🙏
You're doing such great things! Sad I can't get one to support but you have my love ♡ Miss your recipe videos but I'm glad you're doing other good stuff and enjoying life ^^
オシャレ！！！！♡
3000円ぐらいの物なのかな〜と思ったら倍以上のお値段…
ryoyaさんは良質のものにこだわっておられますもんね…
miss your vids :( can you make what i eat in a day videos? and your usual amazing other videos? :) <3 
congrats on the aprin <3
タオル地、いいですね✨
色々な方面へ発展することで、本来の軸にも進化が見られたりしますから、頑張ってください。
賛否申す方もいますが、あまり意識をせずにやりたいように！
in the beginning there was heaven and earth
欲しいです！！！！
タオルっていうのが本当に良いですね！
買います！
Okairi ryoya-kun, it's been a while 😄 congrats!! Those aprons look so nice 👍🏻 Truthfully speaking I would honestly buy this if it had the upper part (a full apron...?) lol I don't know what it's called but the one that covers your chest as well. 

It was nice to see a new video. Thank you 👍🏻
ロゴは、りょうやさんのバックの壁の字体がよかったなー(><)
love your work! please make more of these daily life videos.
I didn't see your "Peaceful Cuisine Apron" in the site :(( Thank you !!!
Missed the sale, but I absolutely love the fact that the apron is fairly wide and that the ties are generously long.
Congrats! I’d love to get one, greeting from Germany 😊💕
I just have seen today this video. I really wanted to buy 2. I love your videos! Thanks for all the recipes and ideas! Alessandra Chiele, from Brazil, but moving to Portugal
Love his passion for his work. A very focused hardworking man.
A full sized one to cover the upper body too would be amazing
Welcome back! I miss your cooking. Lol
Too feminine, eh? Girls want a substantial apron that covers and the longer length is better. I love that it is toweling and you can wipe your hands on it properly.
0:30 I was about to say...thought it had finished😅 had to double check the length😂
ほしいけど、、、
急上昇乗ってますね！
おめでとうございます！

エプロン欲しい！
Welcome back! Looking forward to more of you :)
Why you're soooo cute!! 💖😊 p.s. also LOVE all your cooking videos here! 💥👏💥
何色にしようかな🤤
この生地なら、逆に値段を、おさえてる感じですね。日本で作るんだから、かなりお得ですね。
Sugoi! Congratulations, Ryoya! 👏
Finally you update something.. WE MISS YOU 😂😂😭😭😭
:3 it's so pretty, congratulations ^_^ ...
I put this in the background when I do hw. It’s very relaxing
I like the sound of the Japanese language :-)
お久しぶりです。
I love watching these videos, even if I don't understand a word. But I love the sound of Japanese and I love the calmness in your videos. I missed you. Congrats on your merch!
More ASMR recipe videos please 👋👋👋👋👋👋✋✋✋
It's been a longgg time ❤❤❤ miss you and your videos so much!
Beautiful!!!  I truly admire the care that you put into all that you do

Well It's been A While
Welcome Back Mate
Uwaaaa welcome backk. What should i say?? Ohisashiburi??? Okay, honestly i miss your video. Thx for come when im going to be crazy because exam period. You save me :')
全身のやつも欲しい！
Yay! Woke up this morning with a fresh new video :) I’m terrible in the kitchen but I would buy an apron only because it was by the master, Ryoya;D
Nice ~~~ ah I want to buy it even though I don't really cook much, just to support you ^^ ~~ It costs a bit much though  .-. Sigh
今治！愛媛出身なので嬉しいコラボです❣️❣️
なんかいい感じのエプロン探してたところなのでとても嬉しいです！！
タオル生地も触り心地良さそうだし、デザインが派手じゃないのがすごく良いです！
間空いたんで心配でした笑
憧れです(^ ^)！
Yaaaay! You're finally back ^^
missed you plz upload more videos
更新きたー！
I wish you uploaded more on your second channel
大好きでス
You are amazing bruh! As well as your videos, they really are good!
海外配送できるなんて！ありがとうございます😆うれしい😍
He sounds as gentle as you'd imagine. wow
オシャレなエプロンですね( ^ω^ )
とてもカッコいいです^ ^
I just found your channel tonight and was upset to find out the sale had ended only a few days ago. Will there be any possibility of it going on sale again in the future?
If I'm not vegan, can I wear these aprons?  ;p
購入させていただきました。到着を楽しみにしています。
I wish your cookbook was translated already! Or that my Japanese was good enough to read it, haha. :)
久しぶりの更新
待ってました
わーー！！
すごく素敵ですね！
母の日にプレゼントしたかった～(´°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥ω°̥̥̥̥̥̥̥̥｀)
エプロンは長いほうが良いと思います。
今みたからもう買えないって辛い(´；ω；｀)
お久しぶりです♪
タオル地いいですね♪(^-^)/
いろんな方面での活躍に期待!!
Yeah... Gooood to see you again.. Love from Denmark
Even this conversation is somehow calming
I thought for a minute you quit and I was going through withdrawal syndrome already😅 Welcome back and those aprons look good.

りょうやさんがつけてみたイメージ映像が見たかった～。コメントにもありましたが、りょうやさんのウェブセレクトショップをやったら良いと思います。海外のセレクト商品も含めて。りょうやさんのセレクトセンスは本当に素晴らしいので。
おー(・о・)！  可愛いですね！
お疲れ様です＾＾綾也さんがエプロンをしているところを見てみたいです☆
we missed you ryoya-san
打ち合わせが楽しそうｗいいのが出来ましたね！欲を言えばりょうやさんが着けてるところを見たかった＞＜
注文しました♪料理関係の事業をしているので届いて使うのが楽しみです(^_^)/
なかなか男っぽいエプロンですね(*´-`)
いいデザインです
PLEASE COOK MORE...I LOVE IT!
タオル地のエプロンって便利ですね！
りょうやさんのセンスは間違いないですね〜！めっちゃかわいい！
Yaaaay new video ♥️🤤
Really missed your videos, great to see you back! :)
タオル地エプロンは、手を拭く前提だからやっぱり質より量かなぁ。神経質だと１回使ったら洗う人もいるしね。
でもこういった素材だったり生産者だったり、構想を練って形にして広めて知ってもらうことにも意義があるんだろーね。楽しそう。
Ryoya welcome back we all missed you
素敵なエプロンですね！
作り手の皆さんのこだわりと生き生きした心意気を感じてすぐに注文しました。楽しみに待ってます！
I don't understand, but i love you♡
使い古しのタオルでエプロン自作してますけど、
このエプロンいいですね(*´꒳`*)
Well done, Ryoyo! Great success with it
im watching this at 2 am what's good
エプロンつけて見せてくれたらいいのになぁ。
高いって聞いたけど安くて吹いたw
高くはないよこれ
The notification alone made me smile
1st comment. Maybe
I think two pockets was a good idea. How about adding a pocket on the left side too? Left-handed people will thank you :)
Peaceful Cuisine オリジナルグッズ！待ってました！ぜひ買わせていただきます！！
どうしよう…色迷う！！
私のお兄ちゃんに似てるw
この独特の雰囲気は誰にも真似できませんw
これいいな！
最近周りの友人が出産ラッシュで…
子供用品はたくさんもらうだろうけどママ用の贈り物探してたんです！
これはほんまに良い！
Ryoya San, its nice to have you back !
欲しいけどエプロンにこの値段は出せない(΄◉◞౪◟◉｀)
欲しいけど
すごくすごく欲しいけど(΄◉◞౪◟◉｀)
タオル生地いいですね。注文させてもらいます。届くの楽しみにしています！
we missed you
japanese are always so humble and calm
i feel like my boyfriend and i would really enjoy these aprons! love the grey and kinari - they're all so cute and seem to have good utility.
栗原はるみさん的な感じになっていくのかな。レシピ本出して、グッズ販売して…。儲かりそう。
以前に写真を販売するって言った時も思ったことだけれど、彼自身が商魂たくましいのか？
それとも、お金儲けをしたい人たちが彼の周りに集まってきているのか？
穏やかに、商売っ気を出さないように出さないようにオシャレにやってるけど、
やっぱりすごく金儲けのニオイがプンプンして購買意欲が削がれちゃうw
私もやはり料理の動画がすごく好きだった一人だったから。
見るのが遅かったぁ〜泣
They look great but works out around £70 in the UK, would be very surprised if someone paid that to be honest. I would think they should sell better locally.
エプロン見つけられなかった
My best wishes to you all in this proyect
Japan really has a law about wearing 'a towel' outside the house?  Very odd.  It's basically a lot like wearing a bathrobe, so can't imagine why.  And is 'toweling' basically just terrycloth?
お久しぶりです！
I wait so long for the apron
I love this channel so much.
뭔가이분은 현실세계에 없는 사람같아⭐️
エプロンでタオル生地なのは店頭で探してもなかなか見つからないので、すごく嬉しいです。
これでより一層、料理をするのが楽しくなります。

早速ベージュを注文させて頂きました。
届くの楽しみにしています。
You deserve more views I swear!You’re one of the rare people on YouTube that put so much effort into making quality content while still keeping it real and genuine.Besides,you’re also a great role model for any person,regardless of age and gender.The qualities of a hardworking and organized person radiate in every one of your videos.I truly enjoy watching your content and I know I’m not the only one.I just hope that you’ll get the appreciation and support you deserve in the future.
You look so Artis and cute
Halo, i always like your videos
So relaxing
りょーやさん最近こういうのばっかりになってきましたね。純粋な料理とお菓子の動画をあげてくれていた頃が好きでした。
Long time no see
🌷
YOURE BACK
りょーやさんだぁ！！✨
久々の動画嬉しいです😆
タオル地エプロンめちゃくちゃ良いですね‼︎👍🌟
さっそく購入方法チェックだぁ❕(о´∀`о)
Aprons are nice, but too expensive :( Unfortunatelly, I can not afford any :(
以前から大ファンで、色々参考にさせていただいてます！りょうやさんの動画みてから、こだわれるとこはこだわろうと思いながらいました。
今回エプロンが発売されたとのことで
大好きな赤を注文させていただきました！

届くのが楽しみです( *´艸`)
色迷います…(^-^)
A towel apron is actually a genius idea. I agree with the wife - I often get water on my shirt from washing dishes or sauce from cooking. It’d be nice to have a top part to it. Maybe a Velcro on top so you can choose whether or not to wear it?
タオル地なんですね！！とても使い勝手が良さようです！デザインも可愛いです！
欲しい...
Finally u r back :)
If you live in the US, with shipping it's US$92 for one apron... That's really pricey for one apron. Wow.
🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦
お久しぶりです
買いまーす☺️
何色にしようか迷う
高い高い言ってるから1万超えか？と思ってみたら安くは無いけどこれくらいの価格だと思う
いつも楽しく夫婦で動画拝見させて頂いてます！エプロンとっても素敵です！速攻で2枚購入させて頂きました。
高嶋ファンとしてこれからも応援しています！！
こんばんは！
エプロン今日届きました(o^^o)
大切に使わせていただきます(^O^)
良いものをありがとうございました(^-^)
身に付けるの楽しみです(o^^o)
I don’t wear aprons, but the fomo is real!
I like that it's made out of towel fabric...
それ相応の値段ってあるからね、高いとは思わないけどね。このエプロンに価値を感じる人にとっては妥当な価格。「高い」と思う人はここに価値を感じてないんでしょ。良い悪いではなくね。
I have a quiet challenge/request. I am allergic to tree nuts, as well as fruit that grows on trees. Could you try to make some recipies without those ingredients? (I'm struggling with it)
おめでとうございます !
お久しぶりです！
この作業のためにあまり動画の更新がなかったのですね。。
寂しかったのですが、一気にテンション上がりました！( *｀ω´)
迷わず購入させていただきます！
色はネイビーにしようかな。。

徐々に夏へと移っていきますが、また夏にぴったりの料理動画心待ちにしています(*´ω｀*)
うわぁ！欲しい！！
紐までタオルは洗濯の時助かるし
丈も長めで使いやすそうだし物持ちも良さそうでデメリットがないのがすごい…。
値段以上の価値がありますね( *˙ω˙*)و
Sorry but 1216 is loo long in my opinion though^^;
写真販売は流れだったんだろうけど、これも含めなんかブランディングとかチャンネルプロデュースの方向性誤ってると思うんだが。まぁケチつける気はないけども。
Finally :)
It looks good. But unfortunately I didn't open website for oversea.:-(
Hellooooo where have you been????
Your so cute and I love your videos.
こういう事は他でやれば良いのに、自分はあなたの料理やスイーツを作っている動画が見たいだけです。
I really wanna buy one and almost ask a friend in Japan for help. But I stoped my hand after seen the price. It's too expensive for a apron.
the apron look really nice
Hah I really thought you were done
Love the quality but not the price tag, I could make that myself for $15 tops
ご飯作る時より 食べこぼしで腰周りがベチャベチャになる。
色悩む〜…
すぐに買っちゃった。。。
❤️
エプロン如きに¥6900…………たまげた<(_ _)>
りょーやさん、こんにちは(^^)
お元気そうですね✨今治の会社さんとコラボなんて凄いですね！どのカラーが一番しっくりくるとかありますか？どの色味も発色がとても綺麗で迷います(^^)このスタジオいつ見納めですか？
❤️
You are back!😁😁😁
Haaaaaa..cuando estaran en español
so many lady and girl comment here but not barista
りょうやさん、エプロンの発売おめでとうございます。
女性が着用されている姿を写真か動画でぜひ見たいです！
🙀🙀🙀😻😻😻😻
New hair cut
A man in an apron? Here cums the ladies!
久々のUP嬉しいです。色迷います(*´ω`*)
I’m going to have to get me one of these!!!
Wow I'm in Matsuyama right now (Ehime) and Imabari towels are very famous here :D I have some comments and questions about your apron now... 

I think it would have been good to mention that this product is made of 100% organic cotton (so no plastic is involved) 

Will there also be an apron that protects the upper body? Usually my legs are better protected because I stand behind a counter, but when I fry things (tenpura etc.) oil might splash on my shirts. I am more interested in protecting my shirts/and arms. 

I think the price is quite high for something that just covers a part of my legs. It would be cheaper for me to just buy a towel and tie it around my waist in that case... :/
これは欲しい！
初めまして 質の高い 動画をありがとうございます。聴きたいのですが 水にこだわっていまづか。お教え願います。  Youko Okazaki
Gray + Navy 😍😍😍😍😍
Went on your website but it’s telling me the product is no longer for sale? While you be selling the aprons again?
おひさしぶりです！！！！
Show! Very Good. 
Sucesso, always! 
Hugs . . .  #dgtudo
今治タオルがどうやってここまでの製品になるのかを、ご縁あったらいつか取材してください。沖縄で栽培された日本産の非常に貴重な珈琲豆のような感動が見られるんだろうな～。夫の分と、私のと2枚を即購入させていただきました！いつもありがとう。
Omggg missed u bae ❤
Where is your cafe ? I’d love to visit and eat your delicious food!
Man I’ve missed you !
Arigato🌹 😄
#notif✨
👁 💓 🖕🏾
欲しいなー I would love one but I can’t have nice things cuz I have cats lol
I missed you ❤
Your videos haven't been showing up in my feed for months ! :'( I missed you, and I'm glad you're taking your next big leap on YouTube <3
私はベジタリアンです。最近、貴方の動画を見つけました。素晴らしい動画の数々です。ベジタリアンじゃない方達もこんなかっこいい動画を見たらベジタリアンになりそうですね。私のブログはベジタリアンとは関係ないのですが、ブログで紹介してもいいですか？ブログは最近始めたばかりなので、まだ、だれも見ていませんが……（笑）。
You want $63 for an apron?? Are you insane?! They will never sell well in the united states
Congratulations! Wish u great success! 🎉💪🏻
Hooray ~~~~~!!! Got it
welcome back
ah i wish i could have bought one, but im too late :( ill await your next item then? ❤️
I need your cooking video 😭😭😭😭
Love you from morocco 🇲🇦
7000円でお釣りが来る。
全然高くないと思います。
Just last night I was wondering about you! Welcome back!!!
Too expensive.  Would like better if it was a full apron and not terry cloth.  Looks like wrap to use after 
getting out of the shower.  Guess you’re trying to make more easy money.  Definite turn off.
We still want your book in english please!
It's nice to see you again after a few months
That kitchen!! ❤ love watching it..
Everyone being so polite. He's sexy and hot as hell! Mama mia!
Have you cut your hair? I saw a little difference :")
Hello Ryoya-san :)
0:31 LOL.. you got me
Hello! Welcome back, we’ve missed you! Please update us on how your life has been, we do miss you a lot. You have a very calming vibe to you.
Is this for men only?
I'm like Oreos
I like it
I am not sure how to take that remark about the length being too feminine as if being feminine were a bad thing. Well, I do know how to take it: I won't be buying this or watching any more of your videos.
7000円ねぇ・・・まぁ安くはないけど出せない値段ではないかもｗ欲しいけどお金ないよｗプレゼントとかありません？ｗ
I wanna be your geisha
Seriously are you just going to ignore your subscriber, posting no cooking videos when your channel is about cooking, and then coming out of no where with some merchandise stuff? Do you even care ?
(Produces perfectly symmetrical fluffy latte art)
“Hehe. Terrible.”
"Terrible."

Does the latte art beautifully
dude... how can you cook, bake, build some wooden stuffs, take awesome photos, film even more awesome video (esp your no music videos, I sleep to those videos) and still be able to make "terrible" latte art (that was so far from terrible)... How can a person be so awesome?
well you know it's gonna taste great when it's his favourite
I came here to learn a how to make a latte... 
Instead I learned how to replace parts on an espresso machine
Blend coffee beans for optimum flavor
Roast coffee beans
THEN make and a latte
With latte art of course 

😅
I'm honestly surprised you didn's make your own almond milk.
Starbucks is quaking
Man, your channel its the perfect example of not needing any fancy transitions, loud attention grabbers or click bait. Simplicity at its finest yet with such a uniquely adequate touch and pace! Props man, awesome video!😉👌
Ps: that thing was perfect!
My Friends on a Saturday at 3pm: Jo lets check out the clubs tonight and start drinking 
Me: Oh boi Peaceful Cuisine uploaded a Video
Your equipment is amazing! This a a beautiful process and I don't even drink coffee!
Terrible? That was great latte art!
Lovely! I really like the videos when you talk because your voice is so calming too
Maintaining things that are in decline is an art I feel we have lost in the West. We are more likely to wait until it breaks and buy new. I appreciate your keen eye. Great video
I felt like I was watching a documentary about coffee.
i dont know why, but your videos always seems satisfying. every sound feels like asmr in my head
Came for the latte, stayed throughout and enjoyed watching the machine being fixed xD
how do you know if a bean is bad?
For whoever do the Subtitle, you're amazing 😁
どんなにおしゃれに動画を撮ったとしても、この人のおしゃれ動画に勝ってる人をみたことがない。
特にコーヒーとかラテとか大好きなわけじゃないしビーガンでもないですが、なぜかりょうやさんの動画は夢中になって見てしまう。もっと投稿頻度が上がればなぁなんて思ってます(笑)
勝手ながらいろんな動画、私の生活の参考にしてます。いつもありがとうございます。
I always find your videos so enjoyable and relaxing to watch. Oh and terrible latte art? Ha! 😏 Is there anything you can’t do? 😊
actually he didnt say "terrible" when he made the latte art, he said こうなんですよ which means "its like this"
苛々することなく穏やかな時間を過ごせているようで、本当に羨ましい。
このクオリティーを維持するのも大変なのにと感心しきり(*´-`)
still want your recipe book, i hope an english one will come out soon!
いいなーこういうオシャレな生活
I only have one question... are you single? hahahahah
You didn't get mad at all when you were putting that thing together. It was so calming to watch. You should film yourself building Ikea furniture.
りょうやさんの動画を見てると時間の流れが私と全く違ってて、とても新鮮で癒されます。
いつもありがとうございます。
Your channel is amazing Ryoya.
Men's hands are so beautiful when they are working. I love to watch his hands. Gorgeous! The latte looks very nice.
everything he has looks so professional i feel slightly intimidated by his videos lmao
He said his latte art looked terrible but i cant even make coffee
こういう動画見るのおもしろい
なんか全てにおいてカッコイイです。
動画とは関係ないのですが、仕事は何をしていらっしゃるのですか？
I found that Almond Milk (original) in Singapore during a Japanese fair! I bought it right away, went home to try... And it was the best almond milk i ever had! Regret not having bought more.
Ryoyaさん、
結婚してください😍
Make sure to add grease to the piston and plunger. I don't know if they included that in the parts. High temperature grease that is safe for food contact is what you need
専門的すぎてたまに何言ってるのか変わらないww
I love how good you are at fixing stuff. I also really like the videos you post that have slightly unrelated information to cooking even though this is mostly a cooking channel. I am never disappointed with the content on this channel in general, keep up the good work.
Hey man I have a delongi coffe macjine, but if I try to steam milk there isn’t a lot of ‘sponge’ has anyone have tips pls
Me: i wanna make tea
Also me: boils milk this is too hard
Meanwhile, this man:
おはようございます！☀︎
以前『アーモンドミルクラテの作り方をみたい』とコメントしたものです！
私のコメントを見ていただけたかはわかりませんが、久々のコーヒー動画非常に嬉しいです( *｀ω´)！ありがとうございます！
りょうやさんはやはりダークなコーヒーがお好きですか？？
今私はコロンビアのスプレモが大好きんです。生豆も肉厚で欠点豆が少なく、甘い香りがしてすごく美味しいんです(*´-`)
機会があればりょうやさんもぜひお試しください(´∀｀*)
服アウトドア系でいいですね！
私服の趣味とても合いそうです
I love how he gave us a insight on his journey of making the drink.
オシャレで好き
あと外国人の方々が多いですね。

なんだか気持ちいい
Cómo llegue a este vídeo? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Where did you purchase the coffee roaster you use? I like the square shape and manual hand crank. Great vids..
こんな生活憧れます……！
I'm just sitting here happily sipping my Maxwell House watching some guy on the other side of the world making fancy coffee.

その気はないのは分かってるけど、カフェやってくれたら飲みに行きたい・・オーガニック・スペシャルブレンドの無添加アーモンドラテ・・（；￢；）
I want ☝🏼 one, :( I can’t foam any almond milk I have here... buaaa
if you just pouring water to a glass is still goin to be an amazing video tho.
As I have always said: no matter how good you are at something, there's always an Asian person doing it better.
Wow...talking about perfectionism...he’s amazing...
いつ見てもryouyaさんの動画は癒される。しかも4k最高。

A lot of work, I guess I will just buy it. 😸
La pavoni is so gorgeous and makes great coffee. I've been wanting one for years, but they're so expensive
I love your videos... So relaxing.. And I'm so jealous of your kitchen😂❤️
Can you do a video on your daily routine? Or what a day looks like for you? :D
I'm not a coffee person but the manual process is so satisfying. thanks for sharing. 🙏
Ive been seen your vid this last week, and i think you re very genius picking a perfect color grading, combine with title 👏🏻
キレイな手

Amazing video. Loved the recipe! 
Peaceful cuisine may I please know where did you buy the double wall glass from? I just loved it!
アーモンドミルクラテ、とても美味しいそうです✨ラテと関係ないのですが、荷物の開封動画でもよく使われてる黒いマルチツールナイフが、いつもカッコよくて気になります😳✨
i have nothing but full of amazement and respect towards u  sir. true definition of a "being a Japanese"
We miss your video uploads! Hope you are doing well and got cool projects going on 👍 Cheers from Norway🍷
Always love your coffee-making videos
Great video, Peaceful-san!


*buying espresso machine
I follow your channel since day one and loving you're recipes. Definitely will make this coffee soon. Anyone actually try this yet? Please review!!! :)
You make me want to purchase this beautiful machine 🤔 and I love latte and wish I am your neighbor and knock..knock one latte for me please 🙃👌🏼
It's 2 am. Thank you youtube algorithms
If you haven’t already, try to find some Ethiopian natural or Peru natural and roast them light. They’re super fruity and delicious. Love your videos!

you are amazing
You should try Indonesian coffee 🤗
Everything about your videos is just perfect?! HOW!!
Your videos are amazing. I admire them. 😊
Emma chamberlain would be proud😌

What brand of stove top coffee roaster do you use?
Thanks for adding melayu subs to this video, Mr.Ryoya! i really enjoy your videos and looking forward for more videos✌🏻
Sir hope is all well at your end , for quite sometime no videos coming
Hello! 

I would to ask you what’s the reference the bearing that you used to replace and can i buy at amazon?

Thanks
Do you run a coffee shop? Or is the menu just decoration
🇮🇹 ottima scelta per un buon caffè complimenti dall’Italia e saluti... vieni a trovarci italia 🇮🇹
Using my country's coffee beans... thank you!
I could watch this a hundred times. I also really feel like coffee now
Hey, does anyone know, if Ryoya-san actually open a cafe or something? His equipment is really amazing and i would love to see the process in real life😭💕💕

Tbh i think everything he do turns to art😣👌👌
機械があれば作ってみてみたい心。
You could try foaming the milk after pouring the espresso as this allows the milk less time to separate into foam and hit milk, and spend more time mixing the milk into and emulsion paint like consistency in order to do better latte art. More foamy milk is better suited for a cappuccino. At least I found that to be the way :)

Love the videos!
"Milk foam from the plain one is so fluffy that it's really difficult to do latte art" ..... "terrible"....

Then makes latte art perfectly. I can't even make latte art with regular milk!
Great job!
Thanks for the korean subtitles!
your videos are more peaceful  without speaking or music
Thank you for the sharing! ^.^
Ahh..,love it when he roasts the beans first.
.. 😍😍😍.. that must've taste really gooodd!! 
**imagining it right now
Me: follows for the peaceful cuisine and recipe ideas
Me 2 seconds later: じゃ待って! 日本人ですか？？
Me now: watches and cooks avidly to improve fluency peacefully/ tastily :)
why am i smelling the coffee from the screen?
いつもりょうやさんの動画をみながら眠りに落ちてます^ ^

You grind that coffe bean to medium or fine?
さらっとラテアート施しててすげえって思った
I love watching your videos, the taste of life, peace and fulfillment.
Legit, Japanese Scales measure by how much you add weight to it? So even if there's some weight on what measuring, you can just hit restart and it'll measure on what you add to it.
I need these trivial thing desperately into my life please.
Marry me with ur coffee skills ♥️
This is the most beautiful almond latte I've ever seen since being vegan!!!! Never served a perfect almond latte :((( its usually doesnt have this art just foam !!
Hello Ryoya! May I ask, in your opinion, what is the best tasting coffee brand? I was looking for some recommendation :)
Never seen coffee being roasted before! Amazing :)
if THAT latte art is "terrible" then imagine what the opposite must be. love this channel.
Barista's everywhere are quaking. Let me tell you something, I CANT work with almond milk. How much I like it myself, I only put it in my coffee when I'm drinking it cold. The consistency changes so fast because its already quite thick AND I CANT HEAT IT UP TO SAVE MY LIFE. Ah, he's so amazing.
your video was so amazing. the effect of the video with subs so we understand it . your perfect n completed tools and fancy wow im just amaze with all of your stuffs. great job. good luck. keep it up. regards from Indonesia
i really enjoy ur vdos. 😊but isn't it too much of work for 1 cup of coffee?🙀
Man. I wish I had those almond milks... And those equipments. And that skill. Lol
which coffee roaster do you have? a link would be awesome
I just found your channel and I love it . Beautiful, peaceful work. Thank you.
I love coffee - but going to this extent is just too time-expensive for me.  I'll settle for a small batch from a local roasting house once a week, and just grinding it immediately  before use.  It's fascinating to see the process, though.
Love your extensive knowledge on coffee making, materials needed etc. It was a pleasure to watch :)
Can u do a recipe with rose jam 🌹🙏🏼 Next time?
Your equipment are so unique??🤔funny??🤣🤣
That normally we’ll never seen in daily life xdd
if this channel and juns kitchen ever did a collab, i think i might die from the sheer godly aura emanating from both guys
I wish I was this serious about coffee
Your are a chef, a craftsman AND a barrista? Come on. 😍
How do you have specialized equipment for everything
Small man you have great attention to details but you don’t know what you’re doing, you should not need so many pumps of the machine, that amount of coffee from the beans you measured is tiny your grind is too fine.
Glad you like peruvian coffee! Greetings from Perú :)
す☆て☆き~
Perú (^•^)/
You must try oat milk for coffee lattes, so much better than almond milk. 👍🏻
Perfectly sure this guy is indeed Wealthy
11:05 is the sound of my stomach everytime I watch your videos
Nice dude
Cool, Ryoya. なんでもできるりょうやさんが格好いい。ラテアートまで！Thanks for another awesome video.
I watch your videos whenever I am anxious and I get instant peace. I love the concept of your No Music videos, it's so well done.
Can you please do a video to explain a little bit about your espresso machine. Like how much it costs, etc.
海外の方ばっかりだね...
アーモンドラテ好きだから来たけどこんな本格的とは思わなくてびっくりしたw
I Think Starbucks is Hiring him :p
Great video as always, thanks for sharing!
What is the name of the part you had replace?
I make lattes on a breville
This is such higher level it’s amazing
Someday i will do this, it looks so interesting
I came across this completely unexpectedly as I was viewing Food Wishes.

I. Am. Calm.


This video's music, production value, and his voice have made me feel so strangely calm.

And the small glass of Elektra Moscato... 
Have you tried Oatly's Oatmilk "IKaffe" from Sweden. I can really recommend it, is made especially for coffee and is thick, creamy, organic, very tasty and foams great. IKaffe means "in coffee" in Swedish :)
I'm curious what he does for a living this has to be expensive.
epic! I miss the English translations but still love your videos. Sorting and roasting your coffee beans is next level😍😍😍!
Is this considered ASMR?
How to make?

More like where to buy
I only just found your channel 15 minutes ago, but I think you're probably the coolest YouTuber I've ever come across!
Thanks, Ryoya. I love your coffee videos the most but personal touch and information easily made this my favorite.
Do you still uploaded on your other channel?

Also, that looks really good.
とってる人が素敵だと動画も素敵なんですね👍😭
I just drank coffee and now I want coffee again ;-;
Where did you buy that manual coffee roaster sir ? :) really enjoy your video ! 😃
ahhhh, i wish i could work this hard! the music, the kitchen, just everything! you are so awesome!
i loved the almond milk review
Amazing. What's your favorite milk? I switched to macadamia nut milk.
even though i dont like coffee i ove this video, well i like all your videos <3
This is like "ASMR" for me 😄 great video 👍
peaceful af
i dont know how you managed to make a 13min video about coffee so calming
11:04 Did a demon escaped ? '-'
that latte looks so delicious! btw, can you do more matcha recipes? :D
Why am I watching someone make a latte... Idk but it’s great
Love this style where you talk and teach us the recipe. Your voice is so soothing
You’re jack of all trades my kind of man...you’re uploads are also my asmr vibes thank you ❤️
— Oh! Your voice is soooo relaxing!
12:21 that's not bad at all 
What's terrible is the butt I ended up making after I was inspired to make some latte art
Your voice is really soothing to listen to! Not to sound weird, but it makes me feel relaxed.
That was extremely relaxing.
Amazing..Ryoya! How lucky you are..👌.^^~
Скучала по вашим видео. Они такие уютные, сразу чувствую себя как дома.
Everything is 100× better in Japan.💕
even his voice is relaxing dang
Can I borrow your 10mm socket😂😂#mechanic-memes
You are amazing. I love how educated you are about all the equipment in your kitchen and how you really make things from scratch. I love watching your videos they are so calming and enjoyable to me. It really is peaceful cuisine! Thanks for sharing with us!!
Could u make a vegan or vegetarian okonomiyaki/takoyaki
So amazingly done☕ would love to try💕
I want to spend every weekend just like that, spending a lot of time for a cup of latte.
La préparation est plus importante que la dégustation qui n'est qu'un trop petit moment à passer .Alain (Lille) FRANCE
Pour La Pavoni c'est 2x 6g =12g maxi 14g sinon résultat au top
I love all your videos. I am not a fan of almond milk and coffee together.
Love your videos thank you! Just wondering why you roast so dark?
damn really glad i found this channel, keep uploading guys it's great
I actually make my own almond milk, and it's pretty easy!  It also tastes a lot better than most store-bought versions.  This coffee sounds amazing though!
He didnt say "terrible," at the end. He instead said "just like that."
Is there a reason you prefer your lever over other espresso machines out there?

Also, have you tried roasting your beans in a hot air popcorn popper?
I laugh so much in this vid.....when coffee is ready we will be in another civilization.....joke....or ill wake up 12 to drink it!!!!Hola at u from me
is this japanese Rodrigo Hilbert?
i am so addictive to your chanel
Man, you have more gadgets than Batman...
Certainly, everything he makes will taste great to the same degree when replicated at home following his recipe and method. However, in practice no really can due to lack of those super fine ingredients and equipment... thus, it was quite relaxing and comforting when watching his videos at first and gradually becoming a bit irritating...
Your videos really gave me calm vibes, i always watch it in the morning when i make some breakfast or enjoying the breakfast. Love your videos so much!
caption at 10:57 is my favorite
Lol anyone thinking about Emma chamberlain 😂😂 anyone?.?
roasting your own beans and making fluffy art with nut milks (which is a challenge all on its own) . . . you are next level my man
I'm weeping over your equipment, it's so awesome!!!
For God's sake. I don't drink coffee (I don't like the taste, but I love the smell), but now I'm dying for this latte. I wish I could have it.
OH! I'm subscribed to your vlogging channel, i had no idea you owned this one as well, what a pleasent surprise!
I like your videos! 
Good job man.
I just want you to know, that you saved my live with your personality and the best videos on youtube, thank you Ryoya <3
he is a genius !
Wonderfull video as always
Get yourself someone who loves you as much as this man loves coffee
I've been a barista for a little over a year now, and this is definitely one of my favorite things to see. Someone making a drink just to enjoy it, not knowing if itll turn out perfect or not.
Faz tempo que não posta vídeo amor
Damn. You have such beautiful hands
Unbelievable sophistication....... love ur style simply
Emma Chamberlain is QUAKING
When that coffee machine lets out steam, it kinda scares me.
Hope doesn't burn him😉
Long time no see ! Hope u r ok 🤗💕
Thanks for another amazing video! I was waiting for you to wear those shades again😎 lol. I love almond milk in coffee but I’m going to try latte art 🤔🤣😂
I've read that coming home in Italy a few decades ago ment smelling all the people roasting their own coffee :-)) 
The 80 and 100 on the packages - do they refer to the number of almonds??
what a beautiful man
I loved this. I'm inspired to roast my own coffee beans now haha
Hello from Spain Rioya San, my name is Ignacio, your videos are awesome... a piece of art, I love when you make coffees with la Pavoni, this is going to be my next purchase to improve my espresso at home. 
I have one question, how often you descale the machine and also I would like to know if you have an organic way to do this without chemical products. 
Best regards from Spain.
I have just been hitting replay on this video while clearing out the things I've been neglecting on my to-do list. This video inspired me to be an adult. Thank you, Peaceful Cuisine!
動画待ってました〜☆はぁ〜癒された(๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)♡
I am italian and i am really confused why u call this “latte” latte means literally milk in italian. That is caffè latte that means coffee with milk mixed togheter.
I brewed a pot of coffee once.
Oh Ryoya san! I check your channel and instagram everyday to wait something new. The way you roasting beans and making a cup of coffee includes many passion, I really love that. Hope you have a nice weekend :"> Love you from Vietnam.
Me: messing up latte art with Delonghi dedica each and everyday.
1000 Euros for the coffee machine... okay then!
Dont even know single word what is he saying but I like it a lot! <3
Hey, i just wondering can you make vegan chips video especially from sweet potato 😆
the whole video itself is art 😂
you stay true to the name; peaceful. <3
Always a pleasure to see your videos ! So relaxing...
I have tried lavazza been, is there a better type of coffee, creamer types?
Why is liquid measured in grams and not mililitres?
The coffee maker sounds like it's screaming.

Iced almond milk latte! Emma chamberlain vibes anyone?
You missed a washer, that's why it is scratching the side.

I wouldn't be surprised if he's a cafe owner and certified latte maker. Bet the cafe plays ASMR music too. #travelgoals
Hey, nice stovetop roaster. Where did you get it?
Can you make mochi please? Sorry if I misspelled
Emma chamberlain would be proud
Each and everyone one of your videos is ASMR. So soothing
You are making me want to learn Japanese... 🙈
What is that roasting equipment name?
Miss the frequency of your amazing videos!  Time to start rewatching from long ago! 😆
なんか新しい道具が見えとるぅ
He roasts his own coffee bean!??! Sugoi! Oishisou :)
Emma Chamberlain Entered The Chat
omg coffee from peru, yum!! and inever saw you could roast your beans like that at home wow
You should make mochi also I love your videos
Where can I get a toaster like that? Anyone have a link?
Emma Chamberlain needs to watch this
😲ازاي.
وللهي معلم
dam his coffee machine cost 1k euro!!
いや、きれいやんっ！！！ってなってしまったw 
いいなこういうの憧れる
ちょっとしたアドバイスすいません。
シロップはミルクに入れるよりもエスプレッソに落とすコップに入れてた方がよく混ざりますし、ミルクもスチームしやすいと思います。
長文ですいません‼︎
my goodness you're crazy talented!
りょうやさん！！
動画見たいですヽ(；▽；)ノ
待ってますううう
Beautiful drink, but I would have made La Pavoni replace the defective machine that cost a fortune with an entirely new one. It should not have what looks like quality control issues.
emma chamberlain is shaking
Very good my Friend...  
Excellent Coffee . . . 
       Hugs . . .    #dgtudo
why cant my life be as put together as his work space
I love you
I didn't even know Brown Sugar Almond milk EXSISTED
Amazing video as always
You don't play around when it comes to coffee ! Did you try mixing both types of milk to see how it tastes ? Also , did you try coconut milk with coffee ? I personally like it 😋
メキシコで飲まれてるオルチャータが気になってます！
オルチャータの作り方とかアップしてほしいです！！🙏🙏🙏
fantastico!!!! sono di Napoli e quel cappuccino alla mandorla mmmm che buoonoooo
your kitchen setup and appliances are beautiful.
Those hands 🙌
I wish I had your skills and equipment!
Spent 13 minutes of my life watching some random dude on the internet making coffee. totally worth it tho
um, subscribed.
Very relaxing
Does he have a cafe? I can see the menu board in the back.
Asdfghjkl Emma chamberlain is the queen of iced almond milk lattes
I was so confused when he started measuring the whole beans into the portafilter. That's not how it works at all haha (at least with a conventional setup).
super bellissimo
Will you discuss about coconut milk or soy milk as well plss??
この人なにやってる人なの？
I am curious what your astrological sign is? Sun, Moon, and Ascendant.  Great videos! Wishing you prosperity.
包丁とか調理器具の紹介いつかやってほしいです🙌
I've been to Rwanda! Drove past their tea fields, but didn't know they made coffee as well. Beautiful country
Omg i love his hands.
右端のやつ、超気になる笑
It's from Perú so I guess it taste like heaven
Anyone knows how to get these almond milks in Australia? Or if they ship internationally?
Google Chiapas México for great organic coffee!!
Japan and their invention was lit🔥🔥🔥
Looks good😍
Hi, your video is so good! Make me satisfied.
King of opening things with one hand
飲めませーんｗｗｗ所でこの間夢でりょうやさんが「今までありがとうございました！！」みたいなタイトルで動画出してました・・・・見たら側に知らない女性と子供が出て来たんですけど・・・これ現実にならないよね？！りょうやさん動画辞めないよね？！ｗｗ
Man, I wish all coffee makers were as passionate as you
I absolutely love your channel. Everything is so calming about it.
don't spin your almond milk... tap out the bubbles and pour straight without spinning it. ALmond milk is easy to aerate
So pleasant to watch. How does he make fixing coffee equipment into asmr?
Great video! :) Do you have any tips for taking care of your coffee machine? I recently bought a nice one and want to get the best out of it.
Indonesian subtitle? Wow.
個人的にフルシティローストよりも深く焙煎をするのってかなり渋いと思いますね。
I was thinking about getting the Elektra S1C 
Microcasa Lever in a few weeks but when the gentlemen showed the lever causing damage to the piston shaft I'm kinda worried. Because machine itself cost around $1,645 AUD so i'm wondering has anyone else experienced this issue or is this a one off?
How did I end up here?
Am I enjoying this?
100%
Here in Italy this is just a long Cappuccino...
I love your understanding of the kitchen and its wonders! Please expose your cafe more, as it is my favourite place and you do an amazing job. Cheers!
Bro u are a coffee technician 😁👍
The quantity of milk also made me vomit
Terrible" !!!
Your videos make my mind calm
Beautiful Ryoya... honeys from Chile ... thank you very much for the translation
Am wondering what can't you do  😍
Him :Terrible. 
Me: dafuq
Why not roast beans separately for a greater contrast of flavour?
アーモンドミルクラテ美味しそう！機械を丸ごと送ってきてくれるとかwすごいw
I like his videos, but all the proposals in the comments are a little annoying
u sound so bored but with full passion, your voice kinda  me of saitama from one punch! this is really great!
That’s what craft + passion looks like.
Good guy.
Good idea.
Awesome.
Why am I watching this in the morning while enjoying my absolutely unspecial plain cappuccino? I want a La Pavoni now! T.T
Emma chamberlain approves this video
Starbucks has left the chat
You are a handsome man.
el secreto del café latte es tu habilidad para espumear leche
I want to be a coffee engineer just like him😊
好きを極めてて好きです！w
thanks to whoever did the english subtitles, great job
Okay , I'm in love ! 😍
Matsu pitsu
そのアーモンドミルク私も飲んでます！！
アーモンドの風味がしっかり出てて美味しいですよね！
I bet this guy also makes beer from scratch
SO much ASMR in your videos <3
Seriously though, oat milk (Oatly Barista) is the best milk for coffee, froth it up, you'll never go back.
Thanks for the great idea!  I'll try the almond milk instead.
Emma Chamberlain would be proud
うまそう…
this is not coffee... 
this is art!
ラテアート上手すぎです(´>∀<｀)ゝ
一瞬でラテアートしたのがすごくてビックリしました🙄🙄
Viva Perú
Fresh homemade almond milk tastes really good in coffee too!!!
Emma Chamberlain will be all over this
new subs
카페. 군요. 좋네요
Hello :) glad to wake up with a new video. Peaceful Cuisine is the channel where notification bell is turned on, seriously.
I'm waiting for your next video :DDD
I want to be your best friend so that I can spend my weekends at your place!!!
fantastic channel, bro!
well it's on Starbucks menu now.
ラテアート難しいって言いながら、そのクオリティはなんなんだ（＾ω＾）
Me encanta
Did he just say TERRIBLE ???
Cause I tried to do latte art and it was like shit...😅 And I shall never try again... I quit😑
I swear guys use some ear/headphones  to feel the real ASMR
Not a Latte. A latte is a shot of espresso ontop of already poured milk.
焙煎の良い香りが伝わってきそう♪
ただのお洒落な人じゃない！
ガチだ！！
Shojin Ryori, master..
와 한국어자막이 있다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I love seeing the whole process!! Thank you
you speaking japanese puts me to sleep. your voice is so satisfying
i dont drink coffee, but the smell of roasted coffee beans ... delicious!
the mexican coffee from veracruz its so good
his concept of "terrible" is my concept of "unreachable"
Weirdly i can smell the roasted coffee beans 😂
Man I’m so jealous of his kitchen and all of his equipment. I can’t wait to buy a LaPavoni :D
i wish i can take good care of my life like he's taking care of his machine.  😂
do you really have a coffee shop or is the background a set?
Dude I don't live in Japan man,but I really want that coppee... I want it it has invaded my dreams...
How did you get those coffee beans? It is a site?
You must try Puntang Coffee from Bandung, Indonesia... Java Preanger variant coffee
うちもオシャレな部屋にすみたい(´･ ･`)
emma is shaking
Oh wow, i love love love the way you make coffee
I have no patience or skill to do any of this, but I bet that tastes amazing.
lovvve ur videos 💜💜 so peaceful and relaxing 💆💆
いいね～美味しそう。
作ってみます！
I missed your videos. You are the best
It was a perfect latte art!😍
実験でよく使うトルクレンチが出て来て親近感
The text emojis in the closed captions are so wholesome
よく見てるけど、初めて声聞いた
Me encantas esta padre lo del café Ami me gusta mucho el cafe😘
How long did this entire process take without edits
My parents and friends do not understand my quest to perfection on food. And then I subscribed to your channel. I feel no more alone. Thanks.
It's very rare to see your videos to go to bed because they are very relaxing?
Suddenly I crave this
もっとエスプレッソマシン使う動画出して欲しいです
流石自動車整備士を志されていただけにミラーツールなんですね。
Your video is my food. Thank you for sharing.
生豆の時点で粒が大きいですね。
educate me, why are those beans so light?
このビデオを見て凄く楽しかった。
lol. and here I thought it would be 60€ are they all that expensive, the coffee machine?
lol, butane roasting.
everything about it was perfect ????? wondering how is that possible
I didn't understand a word you said, but I couldn't stop watching :)
美味しそう
This channel sparks joy
どうも。ラーメンおじさんです🍜毎度かっこよすぎて惚れてまう😍

Its scraping together like that because the screw was too tight.

見てて幸せや
Good Morning or I should say good evening.  Your equipment is just amazing.  I’d love to start roasting my own coffee beans and I was wondering where I could get a manual roaster just like yours, I just find it so simple and straight forward to use.  Thanks
the almond milk looks so creamy and delicious! but i don't really like using almond milk for my coffee....the nutty taste isn't really my style. (i like to drink it as is...for store bought one i prefer sanitarium's unsweetened almond milk <that's prolly the best almond milk i can buy in my country, i like to make it sometimes but it spoils so quickly)...i'd love to buy all of the equipments and make delicious cup of coffee at home...maybe one day! as always thank you for your vid...very calming to watch at the evening ^^
海外なのに発送してくれるなんて
素晴らしい会社
自慢の商品なんでしょう
why is all japanese product looks amazing
Even the way he says “terrible” is so positive and pure... how
まずグラインダー の時点でハードルが高かったｗ
This is so inspirational!!!!!!!

Thank you.
Give me some coffee!👏
画質、音質共に最高ですね！

いつもエスプレッソを抽出するときに力を入れすぎてるように見えて、折れてしまうんじゃないかと、ひやひやしてましたが干渉が原因だったんですね！

後ろの右端に置いてある機械って前からありました^_^？
Dat guy seems so cool
Hmmmm, is this the latest video? 2 months ago
Emma Chamberlain needs to watch this and try it out
I wish I can drink any drinks that you made 😍
Do u know Emma chamberlain? She makes the best almond milk latte
Where can I buy that coffee roaster?
Demi Kopiii ..... Itu mata ada lup nya kali yak 😂 teliti amat

すごいな！
日本人で良かったと凄く思った

Admirable when you have nice micro foam with almond milk n sweetener while in the theory milk for latte is unsweetened
was not expecting such a long tutorial! thanks for all the insight!
First time seeing that drink the coffee just after roast the coffee beans.....
마음이 편해지는 영상이예요:) 한국에서도 잘 보고 있습니당ㅎㅎ Love your video❤❤
you are soo peaceful, ı like your video, I wish you put a Turkish subtitle 🙈
Your latte art turned out amazing...
Would you  marry me  ♥♥
Dude, you call the art terrible? Most of us would consider it awesome 😁😁😁
す、すご…オシャレ度がやばい
Wow, talk about aesthetics!
Чё пацаны, аниме ? ))0
Oh, gorgeus :)
Do you own a café or a restaurant, cuz if you have i will surely visit it and order everything on the menu!!
I'm so in love with this guy
Do you use organic or ground beans?
Try to have roasting the coffee on the woods it will give you a very special taste but every kind of woods give different effect on coffee
ビーガンクリームシチューを作って下さい！お願いします！
He can cook, bake, make coffee drinks that are apparently delicious (that's important though), play cello and make plates. He does it delicately and... I think I have a crush on him btw
Does this guy have a cafe or something cuz this is amazing!!!
7:09 wish I could smell that!
I’m in love with you. 😍
Sometimes I wonder if there's a gadget that he doesn't have haha
this was oddly satisfying to watch, even tho i had no idea what he was saying
Please come to American and make us your delicious coffee 🙏
I enjoy your videos. 👍🏼👍🏼
動画見ているだけで、なんだか良い香りを感じてしまう？そんな気持ちになるのはなぜだろう。勉強なります。
Perfectoooo 😍👍🏼☕️
your sound are cute😩😩😩
@emmachamberlain
Masterpiece !
I never use my Pavoni cause it takes too much work hehe
アレクシス・サンチェスに似てる
The only people who care about latte art are the people who don't care about the taste of the coffee or the texture of the milk. If you get nice simple latte art as well as those first two things, it's a bonus. Not a requirement. 

As for the three-dimensional latte art with panda bears and so on, how does your coffee still taste good after all that wasted time?
Wow! Found this video in recommended and voila - I enjoyed every second of this video!
Looks so good
THIS NI🅱️🅱️A EATING BEANS
just watching video feels so chill and cozy.
So peaceful

さっとラテアートしたの見てびっくりした
wow, makes me really wanna have coffee
面倒くさい！けど素晴らしい！
한국어 자막 감사합니다^^
what is he blowing off the beans at 7:00?
Hey, I just started watching your videos.... I am hooked to your cooking.... Wanted to ask you something and please don't mind if I offend you in anyway but Japanese people are more into raw food ... Raw meat so how come you are vegan ??????
Wonderful video. Btw isn't espresso gonna expired in 10 sec if you don't add hot water or milk?
What I always wanted to ask you: Do you own a bar or café? You're always so professional!
凄い！気長に待ってたら本当にメンテの動画が上がってる！このエスプレッソマシンのメンテが見たかったので嬉しいです。そのマシン、メカメカしくて欲しいなあと思ってましたが、自分でメンテは出来なさそうです…笑  動画で我慢します。

Ooou noice
A bomb pancake video would be pretty cool
Where can one get a roaster like that? I want to try to roast my own coffee at home and that roaster is perfect for roasting small batches that will be used within a few days!
I'm so jealous of your Pavoni
Emma should watch this video lmao
Please update soon
I THOUGHT THAT WAS CHOCOLATE IN THE BEGINNING AND NOT A BOX
Your voice is so calming

Emma Chamberlain would die for this
your voice and language is so soothing
This is so satisfying to watch. I want to make myself lattes now and I don't even drink coffee regularly.
なんだこのお洒落すぎる動画は！
Didnt know you can make milk out of almonds
Great video, I love your kitchen gadgets!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Emma Chamberlain whoooo???
I wish I could smell it.. 😍 It looks so delicious! :D
12:18 when I knew I fall in love with him
This channel is basically Bob Ross if he had a cooking show.
Why are all his videos so relaxing?
where did you go?
Satisfying
You sure know how to make a good latte. Hopefully I'll get equipment like you have and make a perfect latte. Or I might just have to kidnap you and handcuff you to my oven haha :)
u seen to have life figured out, i wonna meet u
this is amazing 😊
こんなの家でしてるとかかっこよすぎ
声が落ち着いてて聞きやすいっていうか聞きたくなるっていうか

Where do you buy your coffee from??

That little spinning roaster reminds me of how they roast chilies in New Mexico using a much larger version.
Pure asmr
高尚すぎて全く参考にならん笑

I think you should make ur own restaurant.
여기다!
Peru <3
なんだかセクシー....
Can you tell me where I can find the coffee roaster you use?
Oioioioi, that's cappuccino
Hello man.
Nice vid. A kinda suggestion: If u merge a lot of milk with an espresso in a tall clear glass in Italy is called "latte macchiato" as u did, while on the contrary if u put just a little bit of milk inside of an espresso it is called "caffè macchiato". If u put an espresso inside a medium size cup and then fill the cup with milk it is called "cappuccino". If u use the word Latte alone it refers to the milk itself, served with no other ingredients. Peace.
엇 오랜만에 영상 보러 왔는데 한국어 자막이 생겼네요!! 제가 정말 좋아하는 채널이라 너무 기뻐요 :) 💖 앞으로도 따듯한 영상 기대할게요 😋😆💓

What camera do you use???

質問です！習い事って今なにやってますかー？チェロは動画内でいろいろとやってましたけど・・・。
Hello from Spain! Could you teach us how to do a traditional and real dorayaki please? Thank you!
This video is excellent!  I'm surrounded by coffee all day at my work, so seeing this video invigorates me to be a better barista because someone out there really puts time and care into their drink just like I do every day for hundreds of people, whether they appreciate it or not ;) Also, since you're home roasting (which is so cool; I love that little stovetop roaster!) you can use the chaffe in compost or for plants, it helps the soil stay moist and keeps the bugs away!
coffee in indonesia is Good
yeah but with less talking
I think the latte art looks lovely!
I couldn’t find almond milk anywhere in Kagoshima...except the very tiny little carton at the conbini. At which super market do you buy this almond milk?
焙煎の動画に感動しました。
모지.. 왜한국어자막이있지 으ㅓㄴ래 있는 채널이였나
Your “terrible” latte art still looks amazing😒
ラテアート凄い
Hi, I am interested in your coffee roaster, could you please give me link or name the fabricator of it?
How is that latte art bad??? Omg 😂
Does he have his own cafe in japan?
こんな大人になりたい
duuude, i can smell the perfume ...
This is so decadent
飲みたい😩
Did he use a leatherman tool?
Wooooow..i never find this type of almond milk in my country..can i made my own almond milk and became wonderful like yours??
SOMEONE CALL EMMA CHAMBERLAIN
Hi, im looking for a keyboard for my ipad that’s also a cover. And i was wondering what your keyboard is called, i hope you see this message
The amount of patience in this guy was insane
Ryoya ...Greetings from Texas!  I enjoy watching your videos :).  I remember you asked a long time ago if anyone knew of a way to make vegan Whipped Cream (non-coconut).  Have you seen this version on Youtube? Perhaps it is just what you were looking for.  Hope it helps and keep up the wonderful videos!!    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fNzjUGbVT8
そのいつも使ってるカウンターテーブルもDIYで作られたのでしょうか？
Rって呼ばせて下さい
@emmachamberlain
was that a leatherman?
This video is funny because of your cuteness ;)
おしゃれだけどちゃんと温かみがあってつい見入ってしまうだけでなく、りょうやさんのお声が良いので聞き入ってもしまいます！
Very talented 😊
Come to Sydney, I'll show you the real way on how we drink coffee here.
I want to smell that roasted coffee bean
💖💖💖
インスタントコーヒーばっかりの面倒臭がりだけど、こんな美味そうならやりたくなった
приятно смотреть,хоть ничего и не поняла 😃
The almond milk looks interesting! Is it fully vegan?
You should sell the almond milk and ship it from japan on your website.
Oishii~
NERDESİN LAN AMIN SIPASI
Emma wya

i really want to know what your most amazing latte art looks like now considering your 'terrible' version was amazing to me..... or maybe i'm just uncultured in the latte art world.
mnaam
i wish you'd be featured in nhk
なんでこんなにオシャレなんですか？
Lets have a moment of silence for those shots

What type of espresso machine do you use kind sir?
きれいなコーヒー！！☕️ you roast your own beans too that is so cool
Where can i get the equipment??
Add a bit cacao/cocoa powder 😆
結婚してください、、💒👰💍
@Peaceful_Cuisine the coffee beans aren't available anymore in the link. Is there another way of buying them?
相当な暇人だな笑
Have you ever tried making your own almond milk from scratch? It's the BEST!
😋 👌. Deli    .  SHALOM
Most difficult almond milk latte I’ve ever seen
11:05 that demon sound tho xd
Great video. Where do you get the roaster btw?
Is the almond milk in your video widely available in supermarket?
Maybe you can do a trip to Italy lmao I low key want to see you drinking varities of coffee and introducing those to us
What's the weird tube on the side for, the one that screams at you?
I wish I had that sort of equipment D: Time to save money
why don't you add chicory?
Hijo de su madre tiene de todo!! Y yo ni a licuadora llego!! 😂😂😂

Ive never seen anyone who is this meticulous before! So precise!
私はあなたのビデオのファンです、あなたのチャンネルは完璧ですが、私はあなたが同性愛者であることをほぼ確実にしています。
“Terrible “....have you practiced before or is this your first? Hah also the glass is very cute! Where did you get it? (Locally?)
Hi Ryoya! Beautiful video as usual. Just a quick question, are those 2 almond milks available in regular supermarkets in Tokyo? Or do I have to specially order them on amazon?
So which brand of almond milk can make latte art as well as taste good in other countries? Any recommendations people?
If I were Japanese I would be proud of him representing my country
4:14 the adventure has begun
Emma Chamberlain ? Where are you?
11:04 The scream of a thousand demons
Why I am watching this? I'm poor!!!
おしゃれすぎてやばい

りょりや様、
質問をきってもいただけませんか？日本でビーガンはメチャめずらしいと聞きました。ですから、どうビーガンに聞いたかなと思いました。そして、日本でビーガンはむずかしいでしょうか？
Peaceful Cuisine のビデオが大好きで、かなし時作り方のビデオを見ます。見てからいつもかんじが良くなるでしょう。私は日本語を習っていますからもし間違えて、分かりにくくなったら、ごめなさい。
りょりや様のビデオが私にうれしくならせるから本当にありがとうございます！
Is that his own workplace? 
I saw this video first today.😲
Please open a restaurant or cafe!!!!

Sugoi
12:22 EXCUSE YOU ITS PRETTY GOOD
😍
I want to marry you!
where's emma chamberlain
cool handyman
I can only imagine the delicate smell it must have when he is roasting the beans.
Have you ever considered making your own almond milk?
Soytoy
Do you roast then use the beans straight away? You should wait a few days for the beans to de-gas,- give off its co2 for a better taste.
im... in awe
You are better than Starbucks
コーヒー大好きな様ですが歯の黄ばみとかはどうしてますか？飲んだ後でうがいとかしないか…^_^;
Actually what he says about the latte art: “terrible” according to english translation, is actually こんなんですよ in hiragana, which roughly translates to “It looks like this” or “This is the result” and not anything about how bad the latte art looked like (even though it was in fact, very good).
I’m getting Emma chamberlain vibes
wih... in 'Bahasa'
I like
Husband goals
your videos help me improve my japanese 😊 あり波濤ございます
its remind me BTS 💜💜💜💜
WHAT DO YOU MEAN “Terrible”
I made your earl grey cookies yesterday and it was deeelicious!!! Though I used 2 tablespoons of tea leaves. I have a question, I live on a plant based lifestyle. It's been 4 and half months now. I work out every day for the past 6 years, so do I need to take any protein supplements? Because now  I have a feeling my muscles are shrinking. Though I'm feeling way healthier than ever before. I'm never going back to an animal products based lifestyle. But I just wanted to know if I should take protein supplements like you do. And if so how many times a day? My workout consists of power yoga, calisthenics, core, cardio.
Bellissimo
Me watching this like I'm gonna make it

Your "vegan" right!!! So why you drink coffe from Chile that they use horses on the harvesting and why are your use "honey" coffe ??????
Saying "milk latte" it' s like saying "milk" 2 times. D:
terrible
Sorry random question: are you single? =P
What a cutie
パタゴニアのカモかっこいいですね似合ってます。
thats some expenisive equipment thooo shizz
I wonder what he's saying
Lovely
I’m visiting Tokyo this month! Definitely will try out the almond milk (I’m vegan). Do you have any other recommendations such as food or restaurant for vegans??? IT WILL HELP SO SO MUCH!!
ホント、久しぶりの珈琲動画に感激❣️Ryoyaさんのとこ来ると時間の流れが変わる 特別で独特な空間。こちらで知った焙煎機やポーレックスの珈琲ミルや豆たちを購入して少しでも同じ空間味あわせていただいてます❣️確かに 美味しい。あなたの器用さに見てて釘付けになります🤗
This is art.
The leaf looked amazing and he’s just like... “terrible”. Hahaha
Japan can buy everthing....gato

Great video! You've inspired me to learn (way too much) about coffee and this week I applied for a job role as a Green Coffee Technician! I have a question... Ryoya, have you ever tried your latte art with Oatly Barista? Everyone goes crazy about it over here in the UK!
Japanese
ご飯系のレシピ、このごろないですね。焙煎中、近所の人はコーヒーの香りで「お！」とおもいそう。
Draws latte art... says it’s terrible??? I can’t even draw it terribly.... yours looked great....
I love his shiny kitchen toys!
11:04 What the hell is that
He said "It’s like this" not "terrible"
Adorable, very adorable
I'm from Peru. Come to visit us !
the coffee roaster from auvelcraft is only delivered in japan. they don't send it out of japan. how can i get it?
久しぶりのコーヒー関連動画！！！😃
オーブンやフードプロセッサーなどの、使用している家電や道具を教えて欲しいです
Beautiful :)
Beautiful :)
I thought u could roast them on the oven
11:04 When my i stub my toe
I'm hungry
why dont all the videos come with a no music version :(
11:04 that was pretty scary xD
アーモンドミルク高いですね😅
僕はいつもキッコーマンの無調整豆乳でラテアート頑張ってるんですが、温め過ぎちゃってよく凝固してしまいます笑
りょうやさんは豆乳で作る際、凝固させないコツとかありますか？
So grateful for your videos!!! 😍😍😊☺️💚💚💚💚
Im not the only person who thinks its not terrible at all right? Cause its cute!
Look at this! We don't even know where the food is from anymore, we just accept the stuff it's in the market, and he is roasting and grinding the beans at home. Could've made the almond milk as well, I bet homemade better. Awesome video though!
Terrible is the new Pretty
A title with an opinion?! What is this?!
As a latte art judge, his latte art is terrible
豆乳ならマルサンアイの有機豆乳無調整にお世話になりまくってるんですけどね。有機ＪＡＳ認証ですし。
業務スーパーで買ってます。業務スーパーはちゃっかりオーガニックのライスミルクとか売ってます。
なんか日本語コメ、淹れ方やマシン、材料についてよりもオシャレばっか言っててつまらないな。
別にそれを言うなとは言わないけど、アンバランスすぎる。
料理動画なのに、参考になりましたとかアドバイスが少ないってどゆこと…
How much does it cost for milk?
sorry but emma chambie’s is better
いつも動画を拝見しています。カッコいいです。宝塚のコーヒー豆と筑波のアーモンドミルクにたどり着いたようですね！アーモンドミルクは、良くシェークしてください。凝固が激しいので(笑)コーヒー豆は、エチオピアを試してみては？花の香りがして美味しいですよ！
Coba biji coffee indonesia
Awesome!!
モバイル用のノートですか？
For some reason his face reminds me of Jen from buzz feed
Cool! ❤️
In italian milk is write latte. So milk latte means milk milk? In Italy we call it Latte Macchiato.
ラテアートもできるって何者なんですか！
斯国一

It looks sooo creamy
Prego amico mio
What does coagulate mean?
Looks terrible but it was worth it
そのうちコーヒー豆も栽培しそうやねー。
動作全てがいちいち腹立つな
Nobody can make better almond milk latte than emma chamberlain!! .. facts..
“Ahehehe..terrible.”

You call that terrible...lol
You roast your own beans but you don't make your own almond milk? It's so easy and froths very nicely without additives, and you can control the creaminess and sweetness
Have you tried making your own almond milk at home?
Very Nice.  Where you Buy green Bean ?

terrible? TERRIBLE??!
Hello from uk. I love  your videos is very nice  and i wonder how you buy your coffee for roasted. I try buy some here but is not good with web site you use to buy coffee beans.
いつも楽しく拝見させていただいています。
私のラパボーニも購入した頃から同じ症状で困っていました。同じベアリングに交換したいので、型番など教えていただけないでしょうか？
❤💚💜💙💛
Very Nice !
good video!!　動画アップしていただいて感謝です。
今回もすごく素敵です！！　あんまりラテのこと分からないけど。
久しぶりに焙煎してるところを視ました。
一度焙煎したコーヒーは何日くらいで飲んでしまいますか？
Do you have any other jobs then youtube?

Please let us know where to get that coffee roaster? I like to be able to manually roast my own beans.
What is the device called to roast the beans? I seriously want one to get into roasting my own beans, but no idea how to google it! Any help would be greatly appreciated
Say no to speaking and back ground music pleasee
You are a person who appreciates beauty.
りょうやさんのお陰で、私はベジタリアンになりました。そして友人にもりょうやさんのことを話したら、その人も影響を受けてベジタリアンになりました。どんどん連鎖していきそうです。どうもありがとう！
I can smell  and taste  the  coffee... Thank you for your  videos.😘😘😘
Wutttttt the latte art isn't terrible at all. It's even kinda pretty :)
liked it....
YES
初めてコメントします！コーヒーが最近飲めるようになった者です。エスプレッソが好きなんですが、そちらの機械、すごく綺麗に抽出出来ていますね！私は中古のデロンギのコンビコーヒーメーカーを買ったのですがやり方が悪いのかクレマがうまく出来なくて作らなくなってしまいました。もし宜しければどちらの物でおいくらくらいか教えて欲しいです。T_T
This makes me Happy 💛
finallyyy you updated a video .. love it! always wonderful!
Why did I feel so proud  when he talked about Italy? Ah right, I'm italian.
Ryoyaさんこんにちは、いつも動画感動して見させて頂いております。ひとつ教えて頂きたいのですが、Ryoyaさんが使われているアイランドキッチンテーブルはどこで買えますか？作業が広々で沢山収納が有り素晴らしいですね。自分も色々と検索してみましたが、なかなか大きいのが見つかりませんでした。どこかでコメントされてたらすみません。宜しければ教えて下さい。（＾＾；
Кто от Друже Обломова!?
Too much work for a cup of coffee 😂
how u do dat
Food should be a part of life, simple, not a complex art. The blogger's video, like putting food on the operating table, passes through a cold instrument. It is difficult to swallow.
Video without music is the best
my mother keeps sending me your videos to shame me for my bad cooking skills
A person who can dry grains like that, without dropping anything, just can't be human
For some reason 1:57 was satisfying for me 😂 i don't even know why
Interesting... I didn't know dried lychees existed in this world!
Better than those “world most satisfying asmr videos” a hundred times lol this guys seriously deserves MORE SUBS
I'm stressed because of my exams and classes so this video was just what I needed to take a step back and relax
I hit the "like" button before the video even started, this is how good I knew it will be
Night time ASMR 😍
Perchè il titolo è italiano ?
Wow! Finalmente un video con titolo ed istruzioni in italiano 😍
very weird question but... does anyone know where i can get the cute fork and spoon at the end with the thinnest handle ever THANKS
So I recently started listening to a lot of ASMR videos. I just hide the tab and keep studying. It makes me feel like someone's in the room also doing their own thing which is so peaceful and calming. Am I the only one who finds this therapeutic?
I have a feeling this might taste bland
どんな味がするのか見当もつかない...
I love how his asmr cooking videos are not overly made. like some asmr videos really emphasizes on the asmr and doing it slowly. but his is just him normally cooking. feels like I'm in his kitchen just watching him cook.
You have beautiful hands... (o_o)
異国から輸入してきました感満載のこの材料達
ドライマンゴー以外味知りません。
食べてみたいです
May ask you how can I find the small Vitamix?
材料さえ揃えばすごい意外とやってることは単純に見える…。
材料さえ揃えば。そしてこんなにかっこよくはできない。
キヌアポリッジがなにかはわからないけどおいしそう、、、、
知らない食材とかあるから見てて楽しいし、聴いてても楽しい😆
Never knew lychees are dried too. Or even slices of mango, for that matter.
So neat, relaxing, recipes, and chill🌹 Dang!
食材どこで買ってるんだろう？
watching these is always relaxing. thank you for the good start to my day! this looks tasty.
I just watched the version with music and the no-music version is maybe even better as you can focus more on the image. Very well done!
おしゃれすぎて絶対に作らないけど、音が好きすぎて何度も見に来てしまう、、
Can you please make  mochi recipe with out music  >< by the way I really love your video!
最後めっちゃおしゃれ🙂

これどんな味するんだろう？
気になるけど作ろうとは思わない😅
You give me creative courage to explore cooking more. Wonderful!
THIS REAL SOUND IS GOOD THAN ASMR
キヌアが、キアヌ・リーブスに見えたアタシは疲れてるのか？(　 Д )　⊙ ⊙
お粥良いッスねー⸜(* ॑꒳ ॑* )⸝
Love ur videos...now let's just have one of ur hands...U have the sexiest hands I've ever seen😍😘😉😁
Love how you make everything from scratch.
Subtitle is Vietnamese!!! Ryoya san, love youuuuuu <3
Your no music videos are so relaxing and make great asmr :) I love these vegan recipes as well!
You are so talented.🙏🏽
全く味の想像は付かないけど、あんまり美味しくなさそう(笑)。
I love it! Please keep doing these! This helps me sleep at night, while also having ideas what to eat the next day! Lol
this is the channel of my dreams
I made this and I prefer this with fresh fruits over dried fruits. However, good recipe, porridge itself taste amazing.
I love your no music videos, sound great and make me easier to follow.
Is he has a recipe that is not vegan???🤔
Hello Ryoya! I love your channels and your no music vids are amazing. I noticed the description of this video is in Italian. How come? I'm from Italy and I found it very curious. x
This is extremely healthy for my trashy body lol I just had chips
Another great video💞💞
May I ask what kind of pots and pans you use.  Are they from a Japanese company and what kind of material are they made of?  They seem to be of very good quality  and design.
Your kitchen is so organized. I love it 💯💕
I think Peaceful Cuisine is the best ytc I’ve ever watched so far! Thank you so much for all your videos, sangat bermanfaat 👍🏼 
(it’s Indonesian, sorry, I don’t know the right word in English 😅)
Can’t wait to see your next cooking vid and your new kitchen :)
i am already satisfied by watching this
Hope you can do well in recycle action. No a nice word but is the care about environment.Cause environment gives you many sources and you can do at least something. Comment with no offense🌱🌱Bty I really love you 😘
These videos have more quality than my eyes.
That dried mango looks delicious 😋
Great recipe! looks so yummy.
I hope you see this, you’re amazing! I love your videos, been here for a year now, and I never get tired of them💕😊
Are you single? Do you need a wife? I volunteer as tribute.
音が良すぎるし、かっこ良すぎ！！
can u make an complitation of dough stiring? i love that sounds
The no-sound ones are the best
These videos are so relaxing and peaceful, I feel so much calmer after watching it!
🇾🇪🌷🙋🏼
I would like to try this. Where might I purchase the ingredients?
めっちゃお久しぶりじゃないですか！！
I love watching your videos with or without music...:):)
is it tasty.....??? when you put dried fruits on the porridge....??? it seems bit wierd to me....
رائع ..مدهل 👍👍
Is it just me or is the title of this video in Vietnamese? Does he speak Vietnamese as well?
ドライマンゴーが出て来て初めてデザートということを知りました
#valentinegoals
Fan from Taiwan :)
I missed u so much :'(
ryoya san, you should probably sleep now hahahaha
Will you do more elaborate recipes like you did in the past? The kind of things that make us go "WOW WHAT A MASTER" with your talking oven and stuff  :-D
yumm beautiful simple recipe
Why do you flim in 21:9 but upload in 16:9?
This guy is like the Bob Ross of cooking.
each one of these is a short film
Takashima-san, you know Vietnamese and even know how to write it at recipe and title? It’s shook me at how good you are in Viet. I even saw another video from you writing the recipe in Viet too. It’s really cool tho!
2:00 =)
i always wondered about the differences in this and the vegan version...their the same! i hopped in a non vegan version but anyway nice video
本当にシズル感出すのが上手い、、、
you're welcome ;)
💟😃
NIce but this on looks like it'd be a bit bland... needs some cinnamon, brown sugar, or something
why does this sound so satisfying?
Watching these kinds of videos is very therapeutic to me.
Why is Ryoya the most perfect person on this earth?
makes for a great light meal
he sure is good at presentation
Love this channel
You are my inspiration
Please can i get a heart
くいじんさーん
みてますかー
ちょうどキヌアを消費したかったところです。助かりやす。😁
Oh benda ni la najib makan tu.
Wow, best cooking show on YouTube. Nice
Hello Ryoya san ;) I always eat dried mango and lychees as snacks to far. Thanks to you I knew a wonderful recipe to try with these dried fruits. But if I just cook quinoa for 15 mins, it will have  a little hard to chew quinoa. So, could you tell me the time to cook quinoa completely? To make quinoa softer and easy to chew. Anyway, love you from Vietnam <3 :">
Yumm...
Looks delicious
cinematic
Yessss
okay i have to try that
Sao lại có cả tiếng việt thế =)))
I didn’t even know dried lychees were a thing
This is like 'Lugaw' which is Rice Porridge in the Philippines
thank  you  for the relaxing video
Omg, u know vietnamese?
Brilliant Chef
when did you use the water blended with almonds, that was shown in the beginning?
もちきび+キヌア→赤い汁！？
Sooooo oatmeal?
Thật bất ngờ khi thấy tên video bằng tiếng Việt, cảm ơn anh! <3
Omg Ryoya! You have foreseen the past: last week I've made too much black quinoa and had to mix it with millet to make a side dish... And it was tasty!
ooooooft
The quinoa I buy has a yellow-ish color not brown..Help?
Ohhhh so that's what almond milk is
Yum! 😋😋😋
When is your book out in English?
またなんかよく分からない食材…w
キヌアともちきびってなんじゃ( ˙ ꒳ ˙ )
❤️
最近こちらの動画を発見しました⭐️
あまりに癒されるので、ずーーーっと見てます。
旅行シリーズも好きです⭐️
お鍋の回で、足立育朗さんの本が出てきて、
私も読んだので、嬉しくなりました。
私は、ヴィーガンではないですが、
こんな料理を作って、
ベジな食生活送ってみたくなりました⭐️
夫と子供が食べるかが問題です。。。
とりあえず、パン辺りから挑戦してみたいです。
anh là người việt ư ><
I wonder, is it your chopping board at 3:55 ? Really nice..
Nồi bạn dùng là nồi gì vậy ạ
Excuse me Sir,, You can told how to make cheese cake? Please ^^ sorry for my bad English 😅
omg i cant believe that the video's title is in Vietnamese 😮 such a great effort
was that dried coconut at the end?
😋
これはどういう料理なんですか？
おやつ？
Lovely as always :)
Hi
Vì sao cái title lại là tiếng Việt
Ơ có tiếng Việt !!!!! Sao hay quá
😍
Is regular porridge unhealthy?
ohhhhhhhh
Thanku
Are all those Pekoe bags made from plastic?
I made this but I  didn't  have  millet or mango so I  added chia, apples, walnut and cinnamon.  I never ate quinoa  before  but I  enjoyed  it thank you.
Where do you buy your spoon and folk??????
Wonderful!
When I thought it couldn't be weirder, it does
That’s ok :)
A là người vn hả a, tại e thấy tiếng việt
Hello!
This looks super healthy 😲
What does dried lychee taste like ?
Wait.. are you Vietnamese or the title was automatically translated??
I love no music videos
センスと物事を追求する姿勢にいつも驚かされます。料理のレパートリーはどう増やしていらっしゃるんでしょう？ビーガンですと日本では海外ほどまだ浸透しておらず、食材を手に入れることもハードルが高い気がします。Ryoyaさんは英語も堪能ですので、海外に移住しようと思ったりはしないのでしょうか？

兎にも角にもステキな動画をいつもありがとうございます！料理以外の趣味の動画も、見応えがあってとても好きです。これからもご自分のペースで是非素敵な動画をシェアしてくださいね！
Well, I have no idea how to make this porridge without quinoa. Might it be okay to have this only with millet with equivalent amount of quinoa? /or Can I find any substitution for unaffordable quinoa?
Is the title in vietnamese or a new feature of Youtube????
Why is this in Italian?
you use soy milk in almost everything, isn’t soy milk bad for overall health? correct me if i’m wrong
Like si viniste por un poco de todo
Perfect timing! 10:04pm!

Little bit creepy with no one explaining what was going on. Totally agree that no music is a big improvement but need something more than the cold dead sound of food
Mmmm... No thanks!👎🏽....  vomit would probably have more flavor.😒
Watching your videos always give me this feeling that I want to be kinder to the world. Thank you!
somehow you've made making porridge a beautiful process! That's some real skill and talent!
Idk the water you drained from the quinoa looked so beautiful 😁😁
Youtube logic; I see youre watching a vegan recipe? Here have an ad for KFC?
That looks delicious - the dried lychee was an unexpected surprise!
凄えぜりょうや
最初から最後まで何やってるのか俺には理解出来なかったぜ
After a long time, I eventually understand why I love watching your videos, because it makes me feel that it's so good to be alive. Thanks!
どーしましょー（●＾o＾●）味が、想像できない
i need those dried lychees in my life
wow...background music is very peaceful....
きっと作れないであろう料理なのになぜか全部見てしまう。。^^;

もはや映像作品としての魅力に取り憑かれてるのかもしれない笑
0:50からトトロ入る
りょうやさんの動画を見ると
自分までお洒落な生活をしている気分になります笑
I didn't know that dried litchi existed ^^!!
映像がすっごいステキ‼キレイ❗
調理の音にも癒されます✨
リョーヤさんの手もキレイです( 〃▽〃)
普段の生活で絶対作ることはないと思いますけど、りょうやさんの動画はもはや映像作品です。
そういえば、ユッカは最近どうなったのですかー？？冬の間プランター達はどうなっているのでしょうか。。
Ryoyaさんの料理、動画が大好きです。。
Perfect!
Woww!!           #dgtudo
Where do you get your pots and pans from?
I live on a tropical island! I haveenever seen dried lychee before! This quinoa porridge is a work of art!
Studio ghibli feels... 💓😍
Lovely video nicely edited!! Very relaxing as well. 
Could you please name the title of the background music please?!!!
Lovely video nicely edited!! Very relaxing as well.

Thanks for sharing Ryoya... ^^ it looks so yummy..
Ryoya-san, the porridge look so beautiful and looks delicious 😄. Thank you for always uploading ❤❤
Thank you so much Ryoya!!! Your videos always inspired me
ドライライチなんて初めて見ました🤭⭐️
You have the best tools ever !! Could you make a video of the basic equipment required for vegan cuisine ? Thanks 🙏 ❤️
インスタで出たドライライチはここでこういう料理に使われたのか～(*´-`)
it could be awesome if you don´t use too much plastic to do your recipes
身体に優しそうですね＾＾
You're so soothing, relaxing, and my favorite to watch at the end of a long day
Wonderful recipe and video <3  I Have a question though, of all of your blenders, which would you most recommend as a good all purpose blender?
That looks amazing. Ive never had dried lychee before.
Your videos are so relaxing and inviting. Thanks for creating such a great channel. I’m so happy to have found your channel!!
Truly a peaceful experience watching your darling videos. I was drifting off to sleep....yeah because....ASMR
Beautifully clean and delish 🙏😍🤘💙
ポリッジってお粥のことかー！りょうやさんの動画見てると新しいこと知れるから面白い！
I thought you're not supposed to wash quinoa and millet?
I usually didn't write a comment, want you know this, I really like your video. It makes me more peacefull.
何味かわからんけどオシャレな食べ物
美味しいのかな？
ちょうど今日のお昼に普通のポリッジ作った！
明日あるものフル活用してこれチャレンジしてみる
This channel doubles as a food channel and an asmr channel 😂
Very classy video making!
Got Addicted to this channel
You are my inspiration
Can i get a heart
I have to comment that besides the whole cooking stuff, I am very glad you are making these videos. They have helped me so much, they inspired me and made me feel at ease. :)
I love all ur cooking video. So clean yet refreshing. And without music only the sound of ingrediants mix is so peacefully. Please make a lot of cooking asmr. I will look for it. *Excuse my english its not so good hehe
What a beautiful video ;-)
This is so smooth it gives me so much chill❤️❤️😊
丁寧な生活。
あこがれる
Huh, lychees grow native where I live and I've never seen them dried before! Interesting <3 great video
最後に上から散らしているもの(白いもの)は何ですか？
全部が全部、オーガニックだからお金もかかりそう…でもだからこそ、体にはとってもいいんだろうな…
もしかして今回の材料全部沖縄で買ってきたやつ？
Beautiful videos, but so much plastic packaging!
Dried lychee?! You are a trend setter my friend 😉👍
It's so good to watch your video after I got my big test in school today, thank you~ 😀
In all your video you are a marvelous chef of cooking. I am a vegeterian since 30 years. I never saw some cooking so delicately and inspiring as you.

If i made some mistakes in english   i am sorry this not my mother tougue.
Your videos are super inspiring! Thank you! Just made mine.. not comparable though :(
thanks for sharing this recipe😍
look at that beautiful 2 coloured table~ amazing video btw
why did that almost bring me to tears
this microphone is wonderful!
I'm quite new to this channel, but is he vegan?
As always, perfect recipe and video
Much goodness! What pan/pot do you use?
Those were dried longan, instead of lychee though. Beautiful video as always~
お米食べないんですか？
いったいどこでレシピや材料を手に入れてるんや……
Amazing video! My mother-in-law usually make this with oatmeal milk and dried apple + dried apricots and then serve with some hazelnut milk. It's so sooooo good.
ライチとココナッツはありませんでしたが作ってみました！
Because the music was so relaxing I’ll almost fell asleep while watching the video.
this soothes my soul
Quinoa bread recipe! Thanks ;)
This looks great - as always ;-)
I just wonder, you're using the almonds as they are. I've always thought you should let them soak for about 8 hours before using/eating them?
the sounds :O just perfect
Never seen dried lychee before !
That was perfect. 😍😍😍😍😍
Everytime so relaxing 😍
omg yesssss
キネティックサンド！
Does anyone know the brand of millet and quinoa in the video? 😊
in Russia there is only millet :(
#valentinegoals
Can I use fresh mango and lychee ?
It makes me hungry man :)
If you're doing a Q&A soon, I would love to know: where are the best places in Japan for vegans? I'm travelling there in August and want to know which regions are best :)
its very very peaceful ;-) LIKE it
What an art! Lovely!! Thank you 🙏
why your quinoa left a pink color in the water???
ポリッジってやっぱりヴィジュアル的にも味的にもナッツやフルーツトッピングするのがベターなんだろうけど、日常的に食べるとなるとコストやカロリーを気にして結局味付け皆無の地味～～な食事になっちゃいます
is this a sweet or savoury dish?
Looks so yummy.....
This was so nice to watch, thank you
I am doing this today!!! thank you!
That was so beautiful
Zen Cuisine
Ugh it's a rainy day here and I could just see myself eating this and enjoying the weather XD
またまた美味しそう…
So happy I found your channel!
looks delicious!
あなた自身の音楽を作っていますか？
This man’s life seems so simple yet intriguing. I’d watch a 3 hour long documentary about your life. But of course no one could film it better than you do. I love your videos so much, it makes me genuinely happy. <3
getting so hungry watching this...
so beautiful that I wished you took a handful and stuffed your face
New recipe video please
今回の美味しくなさそう… 
何味なんだろこれ
beautiful. and it looks yummy
1:57 - kinetic sand.
It looks so delicious!!😊😊
Your videos are so relaxing and your food seems so delicious becouse is clear your passion to cooking
正直、ゲロにしか見えない、、、
I am so in love with Vitamix
10 bin aboneli zamanlarını bilirim bee, ne ara 1 milyon oldun reyiz?
This so awesome! :-)
What brand of pot do you use? And is it stainless steel?
Okay but.. WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE??!?!
Can I just use 160g of quinoa instead of 80g quinoa and 80g millet?
I didn't know I could make almond milk?! I'm going to try it. Thank you :)
That purple liquid looked like it had a lot of life force in it :(
ココナッツミルクやアーモンドミルクで作るヨーグルトの動画が見たいです
Is that a desert?
You have the best utensils and pots I have ever seen.  Where did you get your utensils from in this video?
This looks so delicious!
To be honest you give me a lot of hope that I can live my vegan and healthy lifestyle even in Japan. I plan to move there in the future and I‘m a little bit worried about the food, since a lot is made with meat, eggs or especially with fish. But these pancakes are quite similar to the ones I cook at home and that gives me a feeling of calm and that I can continue with my eating and cooking habits.
You‘re a great inspiration, thank you for your videos!
アーモンドミルクまで作るとこからスゲエ...
どんな味なんだろう食べてみたい(๑•﹏•)
ダイエット食にお薦めはありますか、味は濃くない方で、なるべくある程度の満腹感があれば最高ですが
👏😁
Looks really good😊
Just fantastic!
Looks good
gonna try this! I wonder if I can use Quinoa and Buckwheat.  どうもありがとうございました
量は朝の一人部ですか。500ｍｌのミルクは多いかな。残るのは冷蔵庫でどのぐらい持つのかば
maybe focus on your shit food, than gay visuals
I'm actually blown away...
I accidentally unsubscribed you after not watching you for almost 2 years and then completely regretted it. Search my WHOLE HISTORY, even search baking, cooking and anything that can relate to your video content and found NONE of your videos. Whilst searching for you, I found cooking/baking videos I find likeable and ended up loving cooking and baking. Then I searched relaxing baking videos and found you after weeks YAYY. Idk why I didnt search  whatever the heck I typed down with relaxing. Honestly thags the key word
I come here for therapy.😁
Almonds cost a lot here in my country 😔
What do you do with all of the delicious food you make? Do you share it?
Art
What is the title of the music and name of the artist? Its nice to give them credit too. Thanks!
Amazing !
If I opt out that millet how much of liquid/milk I should add instead ? Since I don't have millet here.
What vitamix did you use? :)
God Bless :)

Does anyone know where to buy his spoon and fork? Please help me
Please can i know where to buy the burner?
Let me guess everything has to be vegan

If I do this with regular brown sugar, it will work too?

Can you do a vegan roll cake in future videos of yours. 
Didn't see any on yt and this is one of the best vegan channel so will you?
I can't even imagine what that tastes like. Lemon and bitter chocolate together?!
チョコメチャおいし😍🌱🌰🍫
Wow! Great job! As always
These are beautiful ❤️ thanks for sharing
Best thing I saw today, thanks for sharing
Is everything you make purposely Vegan or does it just end up that way?
Dont think I have had Kokombu before O.o
this made my evening so much calmer.. thank you!
also, adding that lemon juice seems like such a good idea.. to refresh and balance the dense taste of chocolate
AHHH IM EVEN EARLIER THEN LAST TIME 💗💗😂😂👀👀
i love your videos i am from yemen
You should add ASMR to your titles, so many people would love this, i fall asleep to them
OMG! That reminds me of a ferrero Roche <3 I love it.
The “flat lemon” is not well known outside of Japan and Taiwan. It is also called: Citrus depressa, in English sometimes called shiikuwasha, shequasar, Taiwan tangerine, flat lemon, hirami lemon, or thin-skinned flat lemon, is a small, green citrus fruit rich in flavonoids and native to Taiwan and Okinawa, Japan.  It is very acidic. The Okinawan brown sugar has a strong flavor of molasses!
We need more contents ! We love your videos so much, are you planning new stuff coming for 2018 ? What about your other channel ? 
Thank you :)

Looks good. So is it sweet?
シークワーサーの実、初めて見た…！
大きめの柚子みたいなのかと思ってたらみかんっぽかった🍊🍋
I winder what’s the substitute for the okinawan...
カカオがすごく苦そうなんだけど、黒糖といっしょに食べるから大丈夫なのかな。
How do you feel about Byron Talbot straight up stealing your style for his new videos?

Asmr 😍😍😍

WHY IS THERE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND
미쳤어여ㅠㅠ 진짜 개좋아여ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 완전 취저!!!!👍👍👍👍👍👍
it is important to use fair trade chocolate to be sure the cocoa has not been cultivated by exploited slave children.
I am french so i am sorry if my english is bad.
love the chinese subtitles!!

こんばんは！
また今日も癒されました(´∀｀*)
中の黒糖は意外と甘くないんですか？？
それともカカオペースト、カカオニブがうまく中和してくれるのでしょうか？
ぜひ沖縄に行って確かめたい。。(*´Д｀*)
シークワーサーは不思議ですよね。辛めの柑橘類なんですが、甘いものとの組み合わせがおいしいという
Hi Ryoya! Is cacao paste same as cacao mass?
This has to be the most bitter chocolate truffles I have ever seen!
Chocolate heaven i would say.
Yummy!!! 💖◡💖
OMG
Lovely video as always!
黒糖は何処産のやつなんですか？
初めてみるお鍋な気がします…！
カカオペーストも初めて聞いたなぁ
How bout some vegan red bean ice cream 🍨 🌱

初めてコメントさせていただきます！

peaceful cuisineさんの動画、いつもオシャレで楽しく拝聴しております♪
そうしていくうちに、こんな動画が作りたい！と思うようになり、私も料理の動画を撮り始めました！
真似ごとの上に拙い技術ですが、やってみようという気になったのもpeaceful cuisineさんのおかげだと感謝しております！
これからもステキな動画を作ってください！長文失礼しました。。
ngon quá
Hi Ryoya! You make great videos! I hope you'll make a "Behind the scene" video, to show us exactly how are you recording all your scenes and the sound. It looks perfect. So satisfying...
Greetings from Germany,
Anca
りょうやさんいつも拝見させていただいてます
最近の落ち着いた雰囲気の動画も非常に好きなのですが
今後 昔のような明るい雰囲気の動画を作る可能性はありますか？
a big old rib eye steak and this recipe would be a lot better
この時期の女性の必死さがうかがえますね…
おいしそうだ！
