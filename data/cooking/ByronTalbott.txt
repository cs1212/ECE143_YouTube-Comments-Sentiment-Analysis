It been very long time since I saw your videos. I feel happy to watch you again.
Mmmmm. I can smell that sweet breakfast from my screen. (I wish)
Great dish, super tasty looking, but why in seven hells would you eat it on a plate like that?
Hi Byron,could you please make a video on your ustentils that u use for cooking
Mr Talbott,
A very knowledgable recipe full of good food. Thank you!
I am although pairing it with a homemade  Ris a'la Mande Ice Cream
The way you cook is so sophisticated! I love how everything you do is so simplified but with technique. This recipe looks delicious can’t wait to try it!
Fun tip, Kellogg sells crushed corn flakes!  Makes breading so simple.  I always have them in my kitchen. Nice job on, this sir!
Yes!!  I would sprinkle crumbled bacon on top.  😍😋
Great video! Can you turn your music down? Your voice is great but the music is so loud in comparison to it in between sentences.
And I was going to cook French Toast for breakfast.
By far, the best cooking channel I’ve seen in youtube. !!
That plate choice has regret written all over it.
never clicked on a video so fast. Awesome video. Wish Byron would stick to traditional classic American style cooking, but with his twists on it.
OMG the last time I watched your video was 5 years ago maybe and now I saw your video randomly ,that’s give me sweets feeling I miss for this days 
Now I work to be a baker 👩🏻‍🍳 I should back to your channel ^^
Nice recipe, but not my cup of tea being diabetic, unfortunately
OMG, I’m drooling😋
Hey, @BryanTalbott, what is your opinion on so yummy
Gorgeous brunch plate! Gotta treat the boyfriend this weekend. Thanks for sharing!!
Rustic simple accessible recipe! Better to skin the apples though?
I’m going to make this for my Mother on Sunday for Mother’s Day! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
This recipe looks amazing. I can't wait to try this one out for the boyfriend. Plus, the background music is so soothing- what's it called?
What’s the soundtrack in the background, please?
This looks fantastic. This is another recipe I want to try along with your burrito.
I am currently Fasting right now...sooooooooo😭😭😭
Ever do like a collaboration with other youtubers?
i love this recipe! It looks so good, need to try this next time i make brunch
Oh yes give me one please hahaha 😂😂😂
I have NEVER missed a single cooking idea you upload. But with this one I realized how poor I am that I have never heard of that type of french toast.
Omg 😕😕 plz don't do d taste tests🤤🤤🤤
When I win the lottery, I'm hiring you to come live in my house and cook for me!
Looks delicious! I can imagine the smell is divine 🤤
Wow awesome delicious crunchy French toast with caramel and ice-cream topping recipe
beautiful my dude!
Looks amazing!! Can't wait to try it!!
I'm so making this for my mom
I'm sad to see your view count :(
Youtube hasn't been kind to you
That looks amazing!! I want!!!
dang this looks so good :D
This looks so good 🤩
u should make a cook book.
this looks awesome but i’m not really a sweet stuff for breakfast person. love the cereal crust idea though!
First!
Great Video! Good instructions! Looks yummy. Plated like a piece of art
This is amazing, absolutely over the top, most of my friends wouldn't even touch it, too sweet for them, all for me!

Btw, we Catalans usually soak stale bread on cinnamon infused milk, then slightly squeeze them and cover with egg, then fry.  Since the bread is already soaked, there's no worry it will get too oily :) traditional recipe
POT ROAST!! PLEASE
Both you and Rachel have a really beautiful way of filming. Your videos are so calming to watch. I imagine your house to be an amazingly zen place. I’m sure it’s not always with two little boys! 😊 (mama of two kiddos two and under here.) This looks yum. Might send it to my hubby to make on Mother’s Day, hint hint! 😉
This looks absolutely incredible and delicious . Thx for sharing!
How do u n ur wife maintain ur weight after eating all this i can gain weight just watching this video lol
I can smell it from here it looks delicious
Omgoodness!!!
It's so much fun being the older gal who can still eat calorie luxuries like these and not gain weight. Looks delish!! :)
Blue Moon Cafe in Baltimore does this but instead of using corn flake they used crushed Captain Crunch😋

I cant help but to think some candied bacon crumbled on top would have been delicious!  Great recipe though!
First
I'm recently retired, fairly new to internet, i'm missing something, is the word first an acronym for something ?, i cook quite a bit, but i have never heard that term in cooking unless it was a step in a recipe.
sweet heaven almighty
looks delicious but I don't think the bread was soaked long enough in the milk/egg mixture
Wonder how easy it is to adapt this for coeliacs
Insulin peeks from the corner
First :D
french vanilla icecream? what?!
Omg looks amazing.  What other fruit could you substitute?  Peaches?
That intro gave me diabetes
Great to see you back
Yuuuuummmmy ima try to make these 😋
It looks so good
rip
Why are posts saying first ?
Beautiful.
That’s a great dessert. I can't imagine having that much sugar for breakfast (and I have a huge sweet tooth).
If I was rich I would adopt you
It looks so good
so yummy😋
Love this going to try
Blaytiful
Looks so delicious.
I came over to check you out because I watched a video from How to cook that channel  by Ann Reardon where she speaks against video farmers like So Yummy and hope's to spearhead support for real content creators like yourself and others. #keepyoutubereal
Delicious
Have you eaten at La Casa Sena in Santa Fe?
Looks nice but I can't do sweet French toast. For me it has to be savoury
The new Pitmaster books are out on amazon. THE BARBEQUE BIBLE, THE KETO GRILL BIBLE, and Southern Style Cooking. I hope you guys like this set, I did. Ohh, i think they are free for a week with kindle unlimited or amazon prime.
I'll tell you one thing, this channel does not care about practicality what so ever lol
I really wish you would provide attribution for the music you use in your videos. Unless you made it yourself, specifically for these videos, but I don't know if you did.
A video on how to cook brussel sprouts in various and delicious ways...? Or vegetables in general.
OMG! Byron, would you do a video with a fan? (maybe me). I would love to cook along with you.
Looks scrumptious but I would have used some apples from home canned apple pie filling instead of fresh apples.  Nothing is worse than half cooked, hard apples in a desert! And get rid of the skins while you're at it.   ; D
Uh oh.  No wedding band....
I don't know why YouTube stopped showing me your vids, but I'm glad this one showed up. I gave up being a chef some years ago (because of low pay) but still like to spoil my family.
My man, Byron, and his crispy potatoes. 😌😌
Ahh finally a new video! I've missed your video Bryon!
ahhh missed your videos byron!! would love to see more of the restaurant style videos, like the risotto one, or more “farm to table” videos! thanks
Two of my favorite things Salmon and potato!aside from your expertise🌈✨your the best of the best Chef❣️🙏
So substantial!!! Would be happy just with the lentils!!
you're awesome! i love the way you present your cooking! so stylish!!! thanks for sharing!
Wow, way to put out a super elegant yet super accessible recipe!
Yay looks great luv the intro😊
how many servings is your ingredient list for? i assume two?
Hi Byron, I'd really like to see more recipes using farro!
맛 있는 영사 잘 봤습니다.  ^______________^ 👍👍👍👍👍+1
Looks great. Could you do a video on Bermuda Fish Chowder or Chicken Tagine?
Missed you and your videos Byron! MILANESE CHICKEN PLEASE!!! After your insta post months ago I've been just patiently waiting!!! Pleaseeee🙏🏾!
This looks so good! Keep up the great work. :D
Wow, Byron! 🤤
That looks good enough to eat!! 😏
great looking beard and dish! I'd love to see you do a full roast dinner
Finally some good quality videos again, love this
I imagine a properly prepared, marinated frozen tofu would taste as lovely; challenge accepted!
This looks amazing!!! Love all the ingredients. What a fresh recipe! Thanks!
Byron, I am really fascinated with your videos, You always present ordinary things in a very unordinary way and that is the beauty of your cooking. You are truly a master in making things happen your way and make any recipe your own recipe. I am really impressed with the way you have managed to make your videos short and interesting so that people never get bored and their interest in intact in any of your videos.
Thanks for being such an Inspiration for so many budding Youtubers.
That looks so colorful and beautiful! Wowowow!
Wow! I'm obsessed with cooking videos and I catch myself thinking something like "oh yeah I knew that" but in this video everything was so refreshing new and definitely what I didn't expect. Thank you for your work!
Missed these videos!!!  It’s very satisfying to watch.
It looks so beautiful and delicious of course
Also
Your take on butter roasted salmon?
After I watched this I went out and got myself a Big Mac
Looks delicious, can't wait to try! Thanks for sharing.
Yasssss more Mexican please 💕
This looks amazing! Would love to see more with lentils!
I officially name thee the Gourmet Chef of YouTube !!
Hi Byron🥰how about a BBQ for upcoming Mother’s Day and Fathers Day
Thank you Bryon always😆😆
That looks really tasty, for sure. Cheers!
What kind of salmon are you using in this video? Is it Alaskan King Salmon?
Look's Amaizing👍👍👍
"It's like a French fry on top of the salmon"..damn... I want to try!!!! healthy and delicious!
You really should use some guard or one of those metallic gloves to use the mandolin. Even if you think you're in perfect control you should never be too confident. You never know when it'll take away a chunk of your hand. Be careful!
I absolutely LOOOOVE salmon and lentils!!!! Seems like an odd pairing to some but the flavors combined are out of this world!! And what a relaxing video!!!! Hooked from start to finish! Beautifully done! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Top 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That looks scrumptious!
I would love to see different recipes to cook squash, I mainly cube them and sautee them or thinly sliced them and grill them on the stove. I would like to see other ways to cook them and make them savory. 
I will definitely have to try this salmon recipe, I love everything you used, plus it definitely looks delicious.
I can always count on Byron saying, "what's up guys, ok, so..." when he talks to the camera before he eats the food lol.
Were the lentils cooked when he poured them in?
Oh wow 😲 all of it looks so delicious
Hazelnuts aren't expected by most people in a dish like this, make sure to tell everyone in case they have an allergy :) looks nice!
Looks sooo good!
Mouth. Watering.
Wow amazing
Yeet, tasty thot juice got my lady bits going.  I'd like to sit on this man meat's beard and have him taste my sauce. He'd really go to flavor town. I once got a taste of the sea but that was one time back in collage. Don't do that now cuz I go a man, but ya'lls got gude taste, don't know what lentils is but I'm sure it'll taste fine fried and dipped in a gallon of tartar sauce.
That was easy! I was actually thinking about making a similar dish with mongo beans cooked in a traditional Filipino style and a pnfried salmon. Good job on this dish! It looks amazing.
Why do you have to leave the salmon in the pan for two minutes with the heat off?
first
first
My ears ascended watching this
Re upload hehe
And now I'm hungry. I want to make this, how do you cut the potato without a mandaline?
great as always
Jesus
delicious! but 45 minutes cooking the salmon!?
how about a pot roast video?
For the people watching this (and conceivably making this) at home... don't buy or make clarified butter. put regular butter in a pan set to medium-low and once the foaming has stopped, but before the butter browns. Congratulations, you have a la minute, soigne, clarified butter. Transfer to a new pan, turn the heat up and cook according to the rest of the recipe.
That's called "Ghee"!!!!
Have you eaten raw potatoes before? Havent found anyone besides my family. Only the pnes we pull from the ground.
Does anyone know what camera he uses? Plz help
I never knew that was a way to cook fish. I'm going to try it out next time. Time to get myself a mandolin. 

What's the difference between butter and clarified butter? Hows it change the taste and cooking process ?
I love the potatoes crust wrap and the lentil sound like a party in the mouth .
Wow awesome delicious potato crusted salmon
Nice
nice
Seems overly complicated and pretentious
Potatoe not crispy, lentils overcooked, tomatoes completely unnecessary in that dish, spring onions too large and mushy.. again just a bad choice of techniques, food pairing and just very overcomplicated.. why wrap the salmon in the potatoe? It will get soggy anyway..
Thumbs up for the overall video; but thumbs down: too fussy and unrealistic for the average cook. Thanks for sharing.
How can you call this "potato crusted"?  The potato is a "barely there" ingredient in your dish.  Too much going on here...  The images make my eyes hurt.
These recipes are getting worse and worse
1:26 adorable little guy spotted!
Yay you finally brought Rachel back for the taste test!
I definitely will have to try this recipe sometime!
It's been along time .. i really missed your calming videos :) ..
My friends and I love these. I never had the idea to make them till now. Thanks :)
Btw they are amazing with Nutella or hot caramel
Looking beautiful and tasty!

FYI, original Spanish churros are made with just flour, oil and water. no dairy! Perfect for vegans
I just wanna talk to whoever disliked this video.
Churritos
I think if you would have added one more egg the batter wouldn’t be So tacky.
Plus it would have made them more rich and Light and Fluffy.
The fact that it says “every week” in the channel description and he doesn’t upload every week breaks my heart. It’s so sad that the payoff of actually cooking videos and not that instagram bs isn’t great
I'm still stuck at how huuuuuge his vanilla bottle is. Send me some Talbott please
This is surprise for me from your last moment ...n yes i like your recipe too.Thanks
In Turkey there is a similar thing called Tulumba. It's pretty much the same as these, except instead of being rolled in cinnamon sugar, they're doused with sugar syrup.
could you make mexican Glorias?
Mr Talbott,
can you make an austrian Sachertorte?
You look so happy it makes me happy
Please don’t stop uploading! :)
Aztec soup next, pls
What’s up man, I’m going to make this for my family now
Omg these would be friggin epic with chocolate sauce
byron have you thought about getting a camelot page? i would love requesting some cool recipes from you :D
Can you use vanilla extract instead of vanilla paste? Can't wait to make these!!
Thank you,been looking for this :D
this is a great idea, I never think of making them in bite size, I HAVE TO TRY THEM! thank you Byron!
nobody:
bryan talbott: RUSSET POTATOES
could you use vanilla extract instead of paste? Would you use an equal amount or less?
Please upload another video soon ❤
Hey Byron, thanks for the recipe! I was wondering if you could tell us the code# and brand( I would assume Ateco)? of the tip you’re using as I know there are alot of different sizes.
Thanks!
Byron, can you try your take on a Sangria as spring and summer time is right around the corner? Thanks!
Wow, your wife is almost as beautiful as those churros.
And I like that you include your family in the video
Those churros look really good. Awesome. Cheers, Byron!
Could you please make a taco salad
Hey Byron can we use vanilla extract instead of vanilla paste?? Thank you
Oh yum - these look amazing!
whats the song in the background? :)
Your videos are so relaxing
That looks smth i could do. Tnx a lot. Going to try
in brazil we stuff it with chocolate and a sweet made of cooked condensed milk, try this last one its amazing
That looks yummy nice job
Yummy..ty for sharing😊
Rachel looks amazing
Can you make a vegan choffle? Churro waffle?!
This was a cool video and your family is just lovely
You're like the @Matt D'Avella of cooking LOL! I feel like you guys have the same positive and minimalist vibe that I love. Both talented people and inspire me to make more videos similar to yours!
Gonna make some right now!! Thank you!!! Was looking for a new dessert to make!!
You should feature your babies as special guests lol
Never seen such a huge bottle of vanilla.
Yummi!
alright at 3:35 killed me
this was the CUTEST video I have ever seen
Ooh churros 😋 delicious treats 😋😋😋😋
Rachel and the boys need to be the taste testers on your videos!
Yummy,  I wonder if these can eat with icecream.  My mind is creating this one.
Just tasted like fried pan cakes. Nothing great
So neat!
I like churros, they are so crispy !
Dip them in sugar syrup and that’s balah al sham "tulumba” !
FIRST 😍
Made these today and they were awesome. So so moreish and surprisingly simple to make
Nice!!!
They look awesome! 💕
Yum!
they look so good omg
You should dip them into some thick, European-style hot chocolate like they do in Spain!
Hopefully you make butter pecan ice cream in the future
Can I make this without eggs?
Tulumba tatlısı bu
Rachel :)
With vanilla ice creammmmm
mouth watering and awwww Oliver is so cute
You didn't mention the amount of butter used 💔
Them are some dark churros ..
Nice ✔
1:26 happy little head!! Haha!!
Wait a minute... Isn't he broke up with his wife?🤔
Gosong
Delicioso
Dear Byron, I used to subscribe to you and I want to talk about why I stopped watching your videos, and why I think is it not popular.. I am able to appreciate that you put in lots of hard work filming and creating these videos, you make beautiful shots and you've got a great set up. I think that the eye candy is a huge selling point in your videos. However, compared to the other existing video creators, your content is slow paced, it is not very funny or entertaining, and not very informative. 

For instructional videos, I tend to go for fast-paced cooking videos that gives a little insight on the science behind the food, and the other alternative ways to make the same food for people who eat gluten free, who are vegan, or just people who want to be healthier.. Or ways to make the food item more moist, or more crispy. That kind of thing. Or the kinds of side dish that can go along with it.. And videos with little memos and notes on the side, on what has gone into the food helps. It doesn't have to look good, but if it was well shot and well edited, its a huge plus. 

Other types of cooking videos are more often rather funny, and entertaining more than just a how-to video, which is great to watch while eating or taking a break. They usually look really good, and the host is talented at entertaining people/has a nice voice(asmr)/ and the content is usually light hearted, and not really informative. We might just watch the cook fail at making something, or watch him set his kitchen on fire.. Though they are not traditional how-to videos, it is the kind of content that sells these days. 

I think you need to think a whole lot more about the kind of audience you want for your channel if you want more viewers... Well thats my reasons for unsubscribing, it may not be the same for everyone else. Thought you might like like to read my thoughts.
What kind of oil?
Any substitute for egg?
DO YOU KNOW RACHEL TALBOT OMG
I am trying it now . Lets see how it goes. Earlier i tried some other chef receipe but they just blew up huge n disgusting
Yummy.
Those look AMAZING!!! 😍 What’s the difference between vanilla paste and the extract? And how do you decide to use one over the other?
If churros are "Mexican donuts", are these Mexican donut-holes?
Hi Byron... I love your videos. If I don't eat egg what can I use as a subsitute ?
I want to go straight to the kitchen and make these😍😍
how mach butter
Pretty nice recipe man! love your videos btw. Only thing i can bitch about is the egg, original recipe does not use eggs, only flour water and a little bit of salt (at least for spanish churros). Actually gonna try and make them with the egg, might turn out more fluffy. Also you guys look like a lovely family, Keep it up! cheers.
Next time you MUST fill them with dulce de leche before frying. They will be simply amazing!
can you bake them and use splenda instead of regular sugar
I'd nibble on your churro, Byron. Promise I won't bite.
I’m so glad you loved my beautiful island of Puerto Rico. ❤️ One tip for making tostones: dip them in water with minced garlic before frying them. Leave it for a couple of minutes in the water mixture and it gives it another layer of flavor. However, very careful when frying them after dipping them in the water. After frying them a second time make a mixture of garlic with olive oil and add a small costing of the mixture on top of the tostones. That’s how my mom makes them and I love it! (If you’re a garlic lover you will love it too). Love your videos!! ❤️❤️❤️ and that ceviche looks amazing!!!
Seriously BEST chef on YouTube!  <3
I’m so glad you enjoyed the island. The next time you make tostones use a green plantain. If it’s yellow that means it’s sweet and that’s not how it’s suppose to taste. It will make a world of difference. Hope you come back soon 😁
And yet again another amazing recipe ! You always ask us to write in the comments to post any video ideas so here goes,,  I would be interested in a video featuring different salts and when, where, why and how  to use them such as grey salt, pink salt, red salt, Himalayan salt finishing salt, kosher salt, sea salt etc
Peruvian ceviche is #1💕
Dang! Glad my homeland of Puerto Rico was great enough to be a part in the inspiration of this video.
Puerto Rico!! I’m so happy that you enjoyed our beautiful island and our delicious food. 🇵🇷
I’m from Puerto Rico. Glad your video was inspired by our food.
It's 2 am, I'm hungry and this video is not making it better. Sure looks good tho
This one is going directly into my saved recipe videos.  Definitely giving it a go on my next weekend off.  Looks TASTE 😎
So glad you guys passed by our beautiful island, Puerto Rico! Trust me when I say you are both very loved here!

Please come back with more time, 

Much love! 🇵🇷 ❤️
Patacones/tostones are the best! They tend to be more thicker!! When they are really flat they are called “ chifles”
Puerto Rico looks beautiful. Looks like you guys had a wonderful time there. The ceviche looks so good.
Great video... awesome cooking like always... gotta try the Peruvian ceviche though...
Cheers!!
I like him 1000x better for this.. I'm Puertorican and it just makes me super proud ❤
Just found your channel and no doubt your are amazing! great chef.
Your still the best to me even watching you for so many years keep up all the amazing work love your recipes.!
I'm from Jamaica 😉🇯🇲, where yall from?
In love with this video... Puerto Rico is my Island I loved ❤❤
Do you edit your own videos because they are beautiful!!
delicious as always!! I also really love and appreciate how you shoot your videos, really great production value. Can't wait to see your next video!
PR 🥰 so glad you enjoyed my beautiful Island 🌴
Happy you went to Puerto Rico! 🇵🇷 I love my island!!
Beautiful video! I’ve been watching your videos for a few years now and this has to be my favorite. You should try more Caribbean dishes. The Dominican Republic is beautiful as well. Thank you for highlighting Caribbean food and culture
Wepa those tostones look delicious! Loved seeing my island, thanks!!!
Yes Puerto Rico 🇵🇷, Byron, I am very happy that you visited my beautiful island and that you liked it. The tostones are great and we in Puerto Rico love it👍🇵🇷well done with the ceviche con tostones 😊
Oh wow this looks so amazing as always! We get ours at Solita Tacos in Valencia but I’d definitely try to make this at home for a party!
Definitely having Mr Talbot zip lining to my resort and cooking dinner for me and lady would be surreal.
Wow that looks incredible! My mouth watered the whole time you were making it. I liked that you chopped everything together versus separately. I’ve also always wanted to make tostones. Thank you for sharing!
Home sweet home 😍 thank you for sharing !
Mouth watering over here!! I’m definitely stealing this one!! Thanks for the great recipe!
Mr Talbott,
could you show how to make gorditas de nata?
Bruh banaan peze anyone?😂😂(from Haiti)
Thanks for sharing your inspiration! I'd love to try it with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc 😍🍷🐟
I love the fact that you pronounce Puerto Rico properly, it makes you definitely more sexier in my book, and I love love love your food
OMG amazing video and amazing food thank you for sharing
Puerto Rico have soo much great food, I been living here for the last 8 years and I love it.
Ceviche is so good.
Looks like you had a fun trip.That ceviche looks really good. Cheers, Byron.
Omg how you liked Puerto Rico? Im from there
Stunningly beautiful video!!
Love some good Tostones, it's just in my blood ❤my PR
WOW, thank you so much for this byron!  of all irony, i was going to make ceviche sometime this week.  my recipe isn't this one, but i'm gonna try this one now  👍
Dip the smash plantain in salt water before refrying them is better than adding salt at the end 😉
My island am happy do you and your wife liked. Good food = Puerto Rico 🏝
Marnalade restaurant it has some Puerto Rican food but ceviche it is not a common recipe. Anyways any food puertoricans touch they add an amazing sazon ( flavor) that just caribbeans have.
Yours looks amazing!!
Looking forward to a different ceviche to my rep. Glad y’all had a great time! Oh, and glad y’all were able to visit Puerto Rico and love on those people and their culture. :)
Really loved this video man! had a bit of adventure to it and that Ceviche looks fantastic!
Patacones!!!  Greetings from Colombia
Looks tasty brother! Try the tortilla press for them, it works great! They’re also really good when you slice them thin on the mandolin and fry them. Nice job
Did you try the morcilla??  Think about making that 😋
I have eaten ceviche before. It is really good. I need to try this recipe out
absolutely mouthwatering.
Peruvian ceviche is the best!
Hi Thanks for sharing, it looks delicious
This looks bomb! Yum please share some those plantains give me life 💯😍❤️👨🏾‍🍳
Can you cook the fish? I'm not into raw fish of any kind.
I am a huge fan of Cheviche
Damnnn rachle is so sexy😍😍😍😍
Savage
Awesome!! Thanks for visiting my beautiful island PR🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Loving the music...I want to dance.
Byron,What white fish did you use ?
I want some!! 😭
Looks sooo good!!!
Yum 🍌🥣😋
Can it be any kind of fish?
Everybody says it's so good, I'm just not sure about eating raw fish
How popular is elephant apple in North American and European cuisines ?
Could you use a tortilla press on the plantains?
Cooking starts at 3:20
What kind of oil did you fry the plantains in?
I don't eat seafood, but this was really interesting.  I didn't know people could just eat fish raw, with just a little citrus curing.  The more applicable take-away for me, the plantain chips :)  I'll have to try that!
I❤🇵🇷
Looks  i n c r e d i b l e  🤤
We went there 3 years ago! We had such a great time. Didn’t come across the sea food though. We were in San Juan as well. Look delicious.
Any tips on how to find good fresh fish ? What are some things to look for as far as sight and sent ?
Love your videos!!
Plan-tin Byron 😊
Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 the island of so much  history but the food always bring you back to the Island on the palettes. Need to make this ceviche do know how to make tostones. Can I use any other fish in replacement?
Watching you eat is pure torture
Byron is seriously the luckiest man in the planet. Look at the job he has, the life he lived. HIS HOT WIFE. Beautiful sons. Gosh.
Most interesting dish.
so hungry now!
What’s the best oil to fry plantains in?
Glad you had a great time at home. If you fried those tostones in a garlic infused oil, mmmmmm. Another simple sauce that goes with tostones is Mayo-Ketchup. As the name implies well, mix Mayonnaise and Ketchup with minced garlic and VUOLA.
If you would fry a regular banana, will it work like with plantain?
Great video 👍
Really nice
Never thought of serving fried plantain with ceviche! We make ceviche differently here in Belize, and we normally use fried tortilla chips. I love using lobster, but you can use any seafood here. My family loves doing a medley of conch, lobster and octopus! Oh, and I love mine extra limey. Haha 🇧🇿
Hey Byron, just letting you know I have not seen any of your videos in 2 months. Your uploads are not appearing in my sub box, only to go onto your channel and finding all these new videos.
geeday Bryan, another great video, fish looked really fresh... have a question, in video, behind you... the 'french style country sink', wats its sitting on... looks like a slab on some form...? wats size is the sink...
How’s your wife so beautiful after having a baby?
The plantain you used was very ripe (yellow) you were supposed to use the green plantain for frying. But it’s ok I see it’s your first time using plantain but consider this for the future.  Or just do research, there are soo many ways you can cook green and yellow plantains :).
Genuine question: Why not kip the first step of frying and just cut the plantain thinner and at an angle?
Besides getting a bigger plantain chip, what's the reason for not slicing them into thinner slices and fry them once?
Omg! Not to be mean but you just ruined the ceviche, it’s sad to see people not doing culture food the traditional way ! But I do agree with one of the comments dipping tostones into garlic water gives it a better taste.
I want to snatch those plantains from that pot! You have to make the unbelievable Puerto Rican Dish Plantainos. True Fact: The tattoos in his arm translate to Food Whore in Latin and will Twerk for Chicken and Dumplings but only between 10 - 2 am on Fridays and Saturdays and Labor Day Weekends!
Mmmmm que Rico¡
I enjoyyyy this video. The one who didt like it. Is because they life in the cold land.... come visit my island Curacaooooo
PR!!!! 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Aw this makes me miss my family back home in Puerto Rico. Ceviche is so good. I would've definitely thrown in some red onions, though! And when I make tostones I actually make like a vinegarette to dip it in or ill soak 'em so they're still crunchy but infused with the flavors of the dip/sauce I made. Glad you guys enjoyed PR. If you love ceviche you should try making bacalaitos. So good!
9th
I’m the 2 viewer
I would love to see a Peruvian ceviche being made from you! Where it originally came from 🤗
First
Glad you enjoy a little bit of the island. If you get to come a next time, you have to stop at Piñones.
Dude, hate to break it you, but you didn’t do “local” in that Restaurant in Puerto Rico.. it’s a shame
Vomitivo
Your videos are always so relaxing to watch.
“These do not have to be perfect cuts” 

cuts them perfectly
Please do a garden tour!!
Well done!  Fresh is the best!  My garden always "tells me" what's on the menu.
It’s come a long way. All the hard work on a plate man. Can’t wait to see it sometime.
I'm always so excited to see you guys in your garden! Please make some more harvest-videos, and a tour (I know Rachel just gave us a tour but I mean a tour from the cooking-point-of-view :)
Keep going back to your videos since those lobster corndogs❤️
Your food always looks so yummy 😋 and so good! Well done
Would be so grateful to see a video on your garden setup, your soil, box building materials, irrigation, how and why you use what you use. ^_^
I shoulda married a chef 🙀
Amazing! We love harvesting from our garden and you just can’t beat the flavors! We had amazing carrots we grew and have plenty of garlic varieties which I’m excited about!
Salad (S)elebration! You seem to be getting increasingly eccentric. :) My compliments and gratitude to you as always.
I love these videos of you using the vegetables from your garden!
Your garden is so beautiful wow
Well done! Amazing garden! Beauty of green! Thanks!
So relaxing I agree. You gracefully work in your kitchen and make it flow so easily.
I would love to see a garden tour ! Love the feel and vibe of your videos. so calming, makes me feel like I'm sitting in your kitchen watching the process. Looks delicious !
new subscriber  here I love the presentation ..
i love how simple and thoughtful this video was. the colors at 7:50 looked amazing!
So beautiful! My only dream in life is to grow my own garden. Love love love this video! ❤️
It's my dream to own such a garden.. grow my own veggies 😍😍 hope it turns out like yours...it's beautiful... Do a tour .
I don't let my GF watch this.
You have an awesome garden. It's nice to see what you create with your produce. That salad looks great. I can't have a winter garden. It will get down to a bone chilling -37 degrees Celsius, tonight, where I live.   I don't know what that is in Fahrenheit. Alberta, Canada, has got so cold. Cheers, Byron!
Ah a video to remind us to eat our greens 😩😭😭😭
Mmm looks so delicious !!!
No way to explain how good this looks!!!
You should definitely make more of these garden videos. It hits a lot of key elements of a top video . "Harvest" straight into "cooking" and then "EATING" it.
A bit to many jump edits. Especially when you were tasting. It made it un-relaxing for me. The salad looked great however.
i love radishes in my posole topping for that nice crunch
Loved it 💖beautiful 😌
can you do some grain bowls?
One of the most rewarding things you can ever do is growing your own vegetables imo. You got to take up fishing and bring home your own catch and cook it next. The garden looks amazing.
I need this but I just got my wisdom teeth removed ugh
Yum 💕
it feels weird without the voiceover
Delish refreshing dish
Can we please have a kitchen tour ? :)
Absolutely love radishes! We always have them with tacos or we shred them on a cheese grater with some Serrano chilies and a squeeze of lime 👌🏻 they go great with a lot of foods so we have that on standby a lot of the time
Going to try this
The radish leaves make a nice pesto or substitiute for salad greens or even spinach (warm and cold)
Yummy!!😀

Nice radishes
Looks great! :)
Delicious
Radish leaves are so tasty
I'd harvest your 🌰 and toss your 🥗, Byron.
Nice
I have always loved radishes, soooo delicious. Need to make this salad soon. What can I use if I really dont like fennel?
So when is your food network show coming? This is better than most of the stuff on there these days.
That looks like it’d go so well with salmon
Dude I am going to hook my kitchen up like yours. I like the wall oven set up you got but kitchen aid appliances are muy expensivo...
You are sooooo handsome i like u alass i can see u live in my life.....
That is the most inconvenient dipping "bowl" ever. 😂😂😂
watching you barely fit the shrimp in that tiny jar is really frustrating
You sound a little upset, or disinterested in this video. I hope everything’s okay!
he seems to have very low energy nowadays
I never thought that it was that simple to make sweet chili sauce. It's my favorite sauce. 

P.S. I love this shooting style
Was just freakin looking for something to do with shrimp!! Read my mind, this looks amazing!!!!
where's the " hey guys, welcome back to my channel" ?
you seem sad, are you ok?
If it's shrimp, count me in!
That kitchen is magnificent!!! Shrimp is one of my husband’s favorite things! He will love this!!
Its actually freaking genius to coat the shrimp with Kadayif. I am drooling thank to u Byron keep it up.
Love the filo technique, I've never seen something like that before! What inspired it?
The thumbnail looks like a trump wig. Did a double take.
Some shredded coconut would go great as part of the shrimp coating.
Video request: single mama of 6yo and 12 week old so I'm always needing QUICK and easy meals. I know your dishes are about being from scratch but even with that, could you do a video on quick and easy meals?
Looks like the sweet chili sauce from Thailand!
I'm first for the shrimp😁😁😁
This is not philo dough, this is kunafa
I’m allergic to shrimp, but I feel like trying it with lobster! I think it would be great too!
Awesome video and super easy how to, Bryon!  Nice!  It would be great to do a collaboration with you!
There's something so satisfying about getting just the right vessel for whatever you're filling it with. Cuz we've all had that moment of thinking one size would work but then having to get another container/bowl. Extra dishes suck!
That shot of the chili sauce bubbling was so beautiful. I love your filming style!
You always make great food. This is another great looking recipe. Cheers, Byron.
HOLY MOLY this looks amazing i thought it was going to be way more complicated. glad to see it looks doable!
in the middle east, we call this type of dough kunafa 😂😂
Could maybe use cooked rice vermicelli for a similar effect?
amazing !  thank you so much to share this recipe    keep going !
Awesome creation Byron so genius!! CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE YOUR CHICKEN MILANESE RECIPE PRETTY PLEASE😊
Heyy is there a replacement for the dough? Cuz its kinda hard to get in Central Europe.
Omg I freaking love shrimp and these look amazing
I discovered your channel not too long ago, and it’s the best thing I’ve subscribed to in a while! Such wholesome content and super thoughtful editing. Keep it up!👍
Where can I find that phyllo dough? I buy phyllo dough but it's never in a shredded form like spaghetti or rice noodles. 🤔I bet I can use rice noodles to make this recipe got..😌mmm
Yum 🦐🦐 love all ur recipes. 😋😋
As always.... fantastic recipe....💕💕
Just noticed your left forearm tattoo saying Fish, nice!
never in a million years would I have thought to wrap shrimp in....you're a genius.
I thought that they were wrapped in rice noodles lol
You need to call these woolly chili shrimp.
Looks delish and crispy ...golden brown goodness yum 👨🏾‍🍳 that sauce is everything I’m definitely using that sauce on my channel thx love the recipe
Looks so GOOD! Legit!
Why do I have to be allergic to shellfish???? I love shrimp...it doesn’t love me back.
At first, I thought the thumbnail was some strange animal.   :D
I love how they look wrapped in filo dough, crispy & delicious!
quality content as always
Damn i remember you from the cookie cup recipe
I wish you used a nice wild-caught shrimp for this recipe. The differences in flavor between farm-raised and wild-caught shrimp are insane.
Hey Byron, the pastry is called “tel kadayif” in Turkish. You can try using it for a twist on schnitzel as well ;)
It s similar to Thai food :)
pls monetize your channel
Damn this looks amazing!
OMG THAT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DISH
Please bring Rachel in again and have her taste your food. I enjoy seeing both of you together in videos. :)
I need a good recipe for pork chops.
Dude..that orange flame would blacken your good pots and although negligible, it wastes gas..it needs fixing 😢
I can't even stress how good this looks rn
Byron thats looks good! You know how to bake cake? What about chocolate chips cookies?! John here from Macau
Nice dude. Have you tried them butterflied and wrapped ?
Well done man.
Beautiful! You can do it with spiralized potato as well! Delicious and gluten free!
Wow....looks amazing
i added 2 TABLE SPOONS of cornstarch yo my chili sauce and its just a terrible weird looking paste, also i wasted rest of my rice wine vinegarso please upload recipe, i watched video but when i was cooking ni checked only recipe from description, i see in video that you use only a little fork of cornstach so thx
I love the simple elegance of your food. This looks so delicious 😋
Wookie shrimp.
Do you have to use the shredded Filo Dough? Our would regular Filo Dough work? Looks Delicious
OMG This looks so good !
This dough looks like Kunafa dough 😁
Should've cut it like a tempura so it's easier to wrap and stay straight after frying.
Now that I know where I can buy the dough, I am SO looking forward to making this dish. Always good times on this channel. Thanks!
We usually use it to make sweets
It Looks delicious  😊
The 21 people who disliked can’t cook
Filo pastry is thin sheets of dough that's usually used to make Baklava. Kunafa (Kenafeh in the levant, kadayif in Turkey tho kadayif is something else in the middle east) is the hair-like wheat vermicelli dough that you worked with. Two totally different things.
Are you burnt out on these videos? You don’t seem like you’re feeling it.
It’s called ‘shrimp konafa’ as the thing you putted over the shrimp called ‘konafa’
Me making this- I need 5 pots and 10 bowls, I need to break 3 eggs because the shells went into the other ones I also forgot to buy the felo dough at the market.  #SuperSimple
Please show the name of ingredients in written while u r using those .
Love the natural light in the kitchen
Wow gorgeous
Awesome dish Byron, I will attempt that although, I have not witnessed this type of pastry in my neck of the woods here in western Queensland.
for the 3% reading this, I hope you become successful in life with everything you dreamed of, and accomplish more than you had imagined. I am a youtuber myself and I'm not asking you to do anything. but I would love to hit  20k by the end of February! THANK YOU, ALL OF YOUTUBE
すげえな中華料理みたい、エビにかた焼きそば巻いた感じだな～。発想が面白い、サクサクしててうまそうや！長崎ちゃんぽんにこれ入っとったら絶対テンション上がるな。
Any meat recipes . I use grass fed beef or or cage free poultry
Superbe recette . Merci
😋
Oh normally I don’t like katifa as the traditional dessert, but deep fried id probably love
I’m excited to try this
Where can we get that FILO?   What is the name of it?
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us. It reminds me of an appetizer we had at the restaurant I worked at, except they used long thin strands of potato instead of the phyllo dough. I have never seen phyllo like this.
In the Arabian countries we call this dough kunafah
Just YUM!
Might want to re-create an Indian dish.
First
Amazing!!! Yummy 😋
Mmmm very easy thanks!
I’ve never seen phyllo dough like that before!
yummy
Looks like cooked hair
out of 2358 views one shrimp disliked the video :/
This looks like a delicious snack
Wow delicious
I am going on my 4th time making this for friends and I have become the shrimp appetizer queen in my neck of the woods.  Strangers are knocking at my door for it (I exaggerate of course).  This is a no fail recipe.  I am making it again tonight for a bunch of us.  Thanks so much Byron!
yummmmm
That’s not filo pastry, its Greek kataifi pastry.    You might want to check your audio levels, both yours and Rachel’s recent videos are very hard to hear even with volume turned all the way up.  It sounds like you’re mumbling in this one.  That dipping jar was ridiculous.
Kunafe
Where do you buy that phyllo??
Do it very softly shrimp lovers.like it
Please stop looking so depressed 😭
How do you keep your cutting board clean? I notice you have vegetables and raw meats on there in different videos (or a specific example of salting meat raw then cutting the cooked one afterwards on it). Do you just use soap and water on it or do you even need to clean it in between?
The worst part of your videos is watching you eat - pure torture...
The breading is different ! Looks awesome! Haven’t watched you in a while, didn’t realize how much I missed watching! How’s Rachel and the kids?
But what is the music? Did you write it? Is it licensed? Where can I look it up?
Very nice chef
Tell me why the thumbnail looked like one of those long hair doggies on a plate. :/
zjebie spierdolony
Why eating alone.? Rachel is not allowed... 😬
I love a little heat in my dish; however, the sweet chili sauce is incredibly spicy.  I added 1 tbsp of flakes... I would suggest 1 tsp and build up to preference.
Can you substitute the dried flakes with chopped fresh chilli?
I want to make some super hot sweet chilli sauce and have some rather hot chillies I can use.
It looks tempting but the sauce made me realize how unhealthy it is. Interesting though
Byron is always neat and tidy. A little bothered by his pan it looks really gross.
Can I dip it with buffalo sauce instead?
you're not a chef, aren't you?
I thought you suddenly transformed into a hipster.
My dude!! Glad to see you’re uploading again!!!
these things together sound like the most delicious dinner 😍
Those dishes look great. As apples do not agree with me, I'd substitute pears for the apples. Cheers, Byron.
Everything looked so delicious.  Totally things I love.  Some of the ingredients in the dressing for the Brussel Sprouts I’ve never heard of but I love brussel sprouts.  
Great job.  Will be making these dishes.
No ingredients or measurements in description?? 😢
KALE HACK | I noticed the way he cut his kale from the stem so I tried it... Total game changer! Thanks for sharing your friend Byron!
These are such good recipes. I was drooling while watching y’all eat them lol
I HAVE to make that salad! i can't taste the flavors through the screen!
I love the garlic oil purée I can think of a thousand uses for that!
Such a unique way of cooking, looks so good and not over complicated😽😽
Such a great trio! I've been wanting to make something new and try new ingredients, thank you for this! 

Awesome Collab btw(:
You mentioned that you'd put the ingredients below, but the ingredients section is blank.  Would love the kale/cabbage dressing measurements.
Loved them...!! Drooling right now but it's 630 am here.... Though, Making the potatoes and a slightly modified cheese vinegerate (replacing agave with honey, apple cider with ginger or pineapple cider, both home made, and mustard oil instead of olive) from the salad. We don't have kale and Brussel sprouts in my country 🤷‍♂️
Obsessed 👌🏾😋🍽. Im eating wherever he cooks🙏🏽
the ingredients don't appear to actually be listed, if you could find the time to edit that would be swell. Looking forward to that brussel sprout recipe especially.
The presentation of these dishes are absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to try and make the winter salad this weekend; what a great idea!
Looks so yummy and easy. Dinner this weekend. 
Love all these ingredients.
Love your recipes, thanks for sharing them.
I skipped into the video and had a brain fart when I saw a different person cooking under Byron’s voice
Wow! The dishes look AMAZING! Each recipe is super interesting even though rather simple.
Btw, It was super nice to "get to know" your friend. His precision and skills are really nice to watch :)
500F?!  How long, 2 minutes? Geezus poor brussel sprouts.
WHO IS THIS IMPOSTOR! ...i said, before i read the caption. O_o   Great job, Chris. :)
Dude, where you been?
Hi Byron. I'm coming from Rachel's channel. I am a new subscriber.
How’s the garden coming along? We need a vid update !!!
really looked delicious thank you
Omg Compliments to the Chefs looks delicious. Can I use Olives oil in place of Grape Seed oil for the Garlic. Thanks
Your description box is missing the ingredients! Could you add that? I'd love to make the spouts
You put in the description box “ingredients:” but forgot to put them in
6:14 wait, did you just eat that slice of apple? Haha 🍎
So excited to try these recipes out for this weeks meal prep!
As an adventurous vegan home cook, I love seeing this kind of creative exploration - and you used nutritional yeast, definitely a staple with us, along with miso. Terrific!
When are you posting the exact measurements in the description box?
Hey Byron! Can you make recommendations on dinnerware sets?
Wow, that looks so good it made me create a cooking playlist!
Yooooo those look fire 🔥🤤
My favorite foods!!veggies,veggies,veggies!!!YUMMO!miss your Ig posts but I'm always gonna watch you on Y.T..your my favorite Chef...Your editing is always 🔥👍
I totally love vinegar, too!!  Please consider sharing some of your favorite recipes that contain vinegar in a way that does more than just lifts the flavors of the dish.  Thank you! ~Chellie~
Production is amazing! Could olive oil be used instead of grape seed oil for the garlic cloves?
The little pan used is too cute.
Are you planning on uploading the recipe to your website?
Every single one of these I will be making myself YUM 😋
Please please add ingredients and amounts in the description. I've been waiting all week to make these.
I LOVE THIS! OH MY GOODNESS!
Love it! I plan on making those brussel sprouts this weekend.
Chef Chris! That’s my boss
Everything looks delicious!!!
Oh man, they all look so good but I’m most interested in the Brussels sprouts. Can’t wait to try these out!
Hey, people say grapeseed oil should not be brought to high temperatures, what do you think?
First, nice video 💕
The salad looks amazing
<33 amazing
i am your new subscriber
Omg everything looks sooooooo delicious 😃
They all look so delicious!! The salad 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 I’m totally going to try that!!
looks really delicious. Can't wait to try making them and tasting them!!
Wow this was such a treat! These dishes are my jam
these are some sick sidedishes, will use
Absolutely beautiful
Looks delish! Could I cook the garlic in olive oil instead of rapeseed oil?
I'm having issues finding potatoes that hold together that well
Yum looks tasty and healthy
pure art
How big is your mini sauce pan?
What about measurements
you look different...lol and haha
I'd just settle for McDonalods. Lol.
Lol Got to admit was stumped at first when I heard your voice, but someone else cooking in your kitchen. All the dishes look delicious and flavorful.
yummy chefs yummy food
how do you clean your pots?
Garlic potatoes and brussel sprouts are right up my alley 😍 I don't like kale but I'm sure arugula or spinach would work instead.
Yummmm! I love that your using vegetables as the main dish ☺️💕. Who is that adorable being!? That’s not you 😂
This is exciting!
Great video! Everything looked so good especially the roasted potatoes. I'd love to see more like this.
Looks yammmm
Aaaaah. So good
PALATES not PALLETS, my friend. A pallet is a forklift wooden stand. A palate is the roof of your mouth, or your sense of taste. A palette is a painter's tool for holding different colours.
👍
That looks good,  I would make those and i like those tiny potatoes just start cooking with them and i will continue buying them, Because tiny is taste!
Yuuuuuuum 🤤🤤🤤
Great video!!
Delicious
I’m cool with this, just no blacks please
I’m making those potatoes!!! 🤤
Yummy
I'm all about the potatoes
Byron looks so much like Ben Barnes. The guy who plays Billy Russo in The Punisher.
すごいニンニクの量やな、性欲が刺激されまくるような・・・でもシンプルやけどこのミニジャガイモはうまそうやわ、横にスープとソーセージあったら完璧やな。このカリカリしたミニキャベツそのまま食ってもうまそうや、ソースに味噌と柚子を入れるってなかなかセンスあるんちゃう、味噌汁にミニキャベツと柚子を入れてもうまそうやし。出ましたヨーロピアンサラダ！もう皿にソースを落としている時点でヨーロッパ、これは食後に食べたいなー。それにしてもホンマにオリーブオイル好きよな～、なんやろこの子、オリーブフェチ？俺はオリーブオイル苦手やな、よう分からんかった・・・それよりもゴマ油とかラー油の方がうまかったなー、今回作った料理にも合いそうや。てかオリーブオイルってそんなに大量にかけて気持ち悪くならんのかいな？
dude, your yard is what dreams are made of. I'm dying of jealousy...one day
Looks great Byron . 1.5 mil subs ! Congrats on all your success. You truly deserve it! I also hit a milestone. 250 subs lol 😂. But hey at least I’m having a blast cooking with my wife. Life is good friend. Take care man and can’t wait for more videos!
Such a great video! I love how you showed that composting pays of and there are plenty of delicious thing you can make using "homegrown" vegies. Beautiful, interesting and surely delicious recipes!
This looks soo good! What a beautiful garden, it makes the food taste extra special. I’ve been watching this channel for so long it’s so great to see how far you and your family have come. I hope you all have a wonderful year.
I only managed to grow some tomatoes,carrots and lettuce in my garden...but the feeling when you prepare food you "created" is priceless... My favourite chef ever,keep up with good work💕👍
You butternut stop posting these ;)
Such an Inspiration Man. God Bless Ya and your family.
Byron is slowly turning into Mose. Now I really want some butternut squash and a tractor...
Need to try both recipe especially butternut squash my favorite autumn veggie never cook with skin on. Thanks
Love the pacing of these videos -  The seed catalogues just arrived so we are planning what to plant in our garden next Spring... Right now everything is buried under too much snow.
Nice!!  Fresh from the backyard....awesome.
Love these simple recipes! I’ve found in the past that some of the more elaborate/complicated videos have been hard to replicate at home, but I really love videos that are easy and simple like this!!
I love butternut squash. Have you done a ravioli recipe with it yet? Cause butternut squash ravioli is my favorite.
Your whole cooking process is a work of art
I enjoy watching your videos, man.. So refreshing! Thank you..
New subby! You're beautiful and amazing! I love to see a man cook 😁
It’s awesome seeing you garden as well! More videos of gardening  😁👍🏻
Ohh CHEF, after long time!!!!!!!!!!!colorful side dish.Thanks for share
I love butternut squash. This looks so good!
Love your recipes! It would be awesome if you could make a video of vegetarian lasagna! 😁
I love your videos very much. It is awesome how you show your garden and what you do with it. Great recipe. I hope you have a Happy New Year. Cheers, Byron!
I love your live explanations! It might be me but you seem to enjoy this format better as well.
would love to have that yard.
I LOVE the simplicity of these recipes!!
Simple. And delicious perfect for a garden to table recipe. Would love a video of a garden tour
Love the pickled stalk idea, what a great use for that natural color!
Love ❤️ ❤️👏👏👏👏👏everything fresh yummmy 🍾❤️
Great Beard! Fantastic food!
Slomo and quick camera swaps can make anything epic, to include starting a tractor and taking a right.
That squash was beautiful!
I love a smart man.
Looks so great especially in the colder months ...nothing like some health comfort food...the flavor looks epic
Tried the butternut, didnt come out too tasty :/
Beautiful, I love the new layout.
Side dish? I would double each and that would be my meal hehehee
I love this - and I now have serious tractor envy!! - but I would love it even more if you could please reduce the splicing cuts by 50%. Be your natural self in 2019!!
I'd taste your butternut, Byron.
Neat!!
I'm a little late watching this video, but I would have never missed it :P
What was the butter for?
Fifth comment
Wow Byron, great video! Out of curiosity, what knives do you use?
What framerate was the intro filmed at?
That squash looks as rustic as you and looks better with age LOL. Sorry Rachael. But also love you as well - you make me relax like no other, my eucalyptus lavender princess!!
#saveyoutubebaking
Yum!!
how do even come up with this recipe ??
u and your food look so yummy
I like this format way better
Looks good
Looks soo yummy 😋👌
This look great...! I like it...!
roast the butternut with the thyme, surely? :(
Can you use honey in the pickling liquid instead? Or will it change the consistency of it?
I only tried butternut squash last year and saved the seeds and grew it over the summer (in my very first garden). I love it. I usually peel it and cube it and sprinkle with pumpkin pie spice and a light sprinkling of lower carb brown sugar and roast it. I've never used salt and pepper on it. To me it seems like it would be like putting salt on a sweet potato. But I will have to try it char broiled with honey.
How would your pickling liquid  “homogenise” given it’s got no fat in it?  I think perhaps you meant to use another word...?
I’m so happy about the vegan dishes lately
7:30. Dats a bowl
Please please go clean shaven again!
Most people throw the stems away?  Uhm, no they don't!
Everyone I know uses the stem, every chef I've watched uses the stem!
You do separate the stem, but you start cooking them 1-2 minutes before putting the leaves in. Or you can slice the stems thinly so they cook the same time as the leaves.
Please don't say something that might cause people to waste food.

EDIT:
After typing the above, I thought I'd google swiss chard recipes to see how many people used only the leaves, I found barely any...
Bean burritos are life.
Before I read the title, I thought the thumbnail was a fish fillet with like a light golden brown top.  Haha, way off!  But this looks delish.
Instead of using plastic foil every time you wanna cover something, just put a plate on top.
Thank you for coming up with vegetarian/vegan friendly recipes lately! I love it :)
You are  my absolute favorite chef on YouTube!  Your food is totally me style!  Thank you!
Throw an egg in there and maybe some fried chorizo or dice that bacon you rendered the fat from... breakfast winner
One of the simplest foods to make, I don't need to learn to make, but byron just changes that.
Looks delicious my man. Never made homemade tortillas but I’m itching to do so.
That has to be the BEST bean & cheese burrito 😍 omgggggggggg
Well this is definitely not "green chile"...  more of a salsa verde... it does look really yummy! You should try a smothered burrito next or a week of burritos.
Can you tell me where you purchased your cast iron griddle? I’ve been looking for a flat one and this one you’re using looks like what I have been looking for. Love watching your recipe videos.
You explained all the steps very nicely. I will definitely make this one.😄
You had me at burrito 😍
I love how beautifully shot all of your videos are, great cinematography.
you’re my favorite youtube chef. food looks delicious as always!
OMG, Thank You! At last, now I can make my own...so thrilled!
I absolutely LOVE your channel! You are always so knowledgeable and no matter how easy or difficult the recipe is you keep things so relatable.  Keep up the fantastic work!
Just made them and enjoyed both the process and the flavors. Thx for sharing
Hi I like you videos good job, can you make a enchilada's recipe video someday thank you and good job again
Hi Byron, Wishing you too a very Happy New Year. As always love your recipes and the way you present it. Thank you for sharing the love :)
That’s a lot of work for ONE burrito
Awesome recipe man definitely making this soon! The simplicity is really enjoyable.
Hi Byron,
Looks great, keen to try, tfs!
How many burritos does this recipe make??
Looks great! Definitely trying this tonight. I really enjoy your videos. Thanks.
Great job Byron!  Awesome video as always bro!
Hi!!  I just discovered you earlier today and have watched you all day  (too many videos to admit watching) .  Sunday's are my cooking day and I enjoy watching cooking shows as I cook.  You have been wonderful.  I can't wait to try the crispy lasagna, broccoli cheese soup, peaches with tequila, on and on.....   I love that your demos are for about 2-4 people.  My husband and I are recent empty nesters and it is refreshing to see someone create food for a smaller group rather than a 'tribe' LOL.  Anyway...keep doing what you are doing because it is great and I am now a new subscriber and my husband will reap the benefits :)
Looks so good
I'm so glad that I found this channel...Thanks brother
Fantastic Mr Talbott. Indeed that is a real master class on making great food!
Totally thought the salsa verde was tomatillo but dang full jalapeno...right on. Nice medical terminology use. "Lipid"
CAN YOU PLEASE DO A BASIC CHICKEN BURRITO ? THIS LOOKED AMAZING AS WELL!
It is the best sauce made by an American. Yes, in Mexico we use  chiles more spicy (since the jalapeño is a chilli at all spicy). The recipe is good.
The beans to have more flavor you can fry with lard and onions, oil and epazote, or add chorizo. But your burrito is good enough. It would be perfect with an avocado or a pico de gallo!
Your recipes are some of the best out there
I love everything you make!! 😋
If you use a pressure cooker for the beans it will be done faster. Nice recipe 🙂
How to u not cry when cutting onions
You forgot one key ingredient for the salsa which is tomatillos! It adds a great depth of flavor 😊👏👏
omg you sinner you ate a burrito with a fork and knife! 😤 anyways awesome video!
I love your channel, Byron ❤️
would it be fine to replace the cilantro in this recipy with something like parsley for example, as i can't stand the taste of cilantro
Burrito with knife and fork??
I absolutely love that you did a classic
I need you to post more! I love your videos 😭❤️
doesn't it still lack texture? Like adding some chopped marinated chillies/ red onions or maybe tomato cubes without skin in salsa? I will still try it i think :)
That is a great looking burrito recipe. I like you you presented options for it. Nicely done, Byron. Hope you have a Happy New Year. Cheers!
My favorite. I love spice. Maybe I should include the membrane and seeds of the Jalapeno if I want it spicier? Let me know. Thank you.
Made this recipe today for the family, and it was a huge hit!! Even my daughter who never eats seconds went back for more!! Keeper for sure!
Good shit as usual Byron
Damn, that looks awesomely good. Im defenitely doing it. Those jalapeños looks good too.
Hi Byron! Can I request a Banh Mi sandwich video? :)
delicious, yum!
This made my stomach growl lol
Shouldn't it be chilli since you're referring to the jalapeno chilli.
You should make a Caribbean dish
hey Byron, it looks like you love making mexican food. can you make mole?
omg this looks AMAZING! I love a good bean and cheese burrito. I'll prob do it sans salsa because I hate cilantro lol.
Mexican mom's everywhere are P-OD
💙
Your videos are so relaaaxing
I'll just point out that in Spanish the re- prefix does not always mean twice. For instance when you say "frijoles refritos" refried beans it means very well fried. In this specific scenario re- would have the meaning of very.
Where's the green chili???? It's just jalapenos !
Guess you don't wear contacts, then
Where did you buy your cookie sheet? I have never seen an shiny oval one.
That look awesome Byron
Love all your videos but maybe you could start giving tips on how to store/reheat certain components? I don't have 14 hours a day to make dinner lol, for example how could I store the beans if I did them ahead of time? Do I refry before storing, or cook them and then fry again just before serving?
Looks good!  What kind of cheese did you use?
Looks so good
Mmmmmmm. That looks phenomenal!!
I might use Poblano Peppers rather than those Jalapeño Peppers.  Can be milder, but sometimes NOT !
Beans are one of my favorites! Thanks for sharing such a yummy easy recipe. Can’t wait to make them!!
Are the beans already cooked?
where's the meat m8?
Wow! I’ve never seen a bean and cheese burrito look so fancy haha. But it looks amazing, definitely something I would give a try.
Yuuuuum 😋
You don’t blend the beans! You mash them!
Looks delicious 😋
THATS NOT GREEN CHILI! Everything else was good but that. I’m from NM I know green chili
Where did you learn to cook from?
Why would you blender the beans?  Why not keep them whole?
If you do a small extra fold on the corners of your last tortilla flap (like a present), you’ll make a more structured burrito, provided the tortilla is flexible enough to take the extra fold without splitting.  Recipe looks good!
Yum😋
We all need to start using meat alternatives more frequently. The cost of meat is ridiculous and beans are really healthy for you. As a historian, we're not ALL like King Henry VIII who had meat EVERY day; no one else did and neither should we today! :) Looks yummy!
i just happened to be eating a bean and cheese burrito when i saw this video! it was meant to be
Can these be frozen I’m assuming?
Pizza in a wrap
After spending WAY too much $$$ during the holidays, I have no doubt this is going to be the tastiest way to feed the family on the cheap.  Thanks for sharing you magnificent bastard 😎
Looks tasty!
Can these be made ahead of time and put in the frig, and cooked when needed, or will the tortillas get too soggy?
Yummy that looks very good.
I am making the same for dinner tonight.. looks delicious! I recently created the perfect Caribbean jerk seasoning. I would love to see some sort of recipe using a jerk seasoning from you! Xx
Am I literally the only one catching this ??? Bryon green Chili's are different than jalapenos -_-
Do you own a restaurant?
halepeeno
Reminds me of living in Arizona.  Here is Texas, burritos are not eaten a lot.  We ate taco country.
What’s the difference between beans before and after frying
Pinche paisa
3:27 i can see your armpit hair
When I watch your vids at 2x speed you sound prepubescent lol
first
Bro make restaurant quality meal preps.
burritos are meant to be eaten with god's utensils (ur hands)
Was expecting a New Mexican green Chile burrito.....
Was gonna say “this isn’t green Chile” but realized there’s more than just my NM Hatch Chile 😂
Thank you so much for this video ! Been searching for a yummy pinto bean burrito!
Mijo, ponga los chiles directo en la lumbre, el castairon no les deja el mismo sabor :v
That's an enchilada...
First time watching your videos.. This is not green chili.. I'm from New Mexico. A jalapeño is NOT a green chili. Huge difference..
"How to make a taquito de frijoles: The complicated way" 😂😂
I wouldn't called those refried beans..
Looks horrible
"Refried" doesn't actually mean 're-fried', it's somewhat of a misnomer; it's a direct calque of 'frijoles refritos', Spanish for cooked/heated/fried 'well'.
His tattoos are heinous, and a slap in the face to God!
I wish your channel got more recognition. The production, content, and quality you provide is really refreshing and entertaining.
I love the format of this video! Definitely makes your audience feel more connected.
Loving seeing the new style and the garden!
Why did I not know broccoli grows like that  😲
a very rustic meal I made it yesterday,  I like it creamy.... Especially the New York weather is crazy here... it warms the soul
You have such a beautiful energy,and you are a beautiful man. For last 5 years i have tried so many of your recipes and i will definitely try this one,too. Greetings 😊
Having your own garden is a wonderful thing to have. I love gardening, as I'm originally from a very large farm. That broccoli soup looks great. Cheers Byron. I hope you have a Merry Christmas.
Perfect for this cold weather. Merry Christmas 🎄!!
Loving this! I own a veg garden myself, and have grown both regular and purple tender stem broccoli. It’s such a nice plant to grow. I also use the stalks and leaves of the plant. They are just like kale but a bit more tough. I’ve got loads of ways to cook with it, as I can’t stand letting it go to waste 🙈
Wow Byron! I’ve said it before but I’ve been following you and Rachel since your apartment days! It’s seriously AMAZING to see what you two have accomplished! Your garden is amazing! Your kitchen is amazing! This recipe looks bomb!! I’m so happy for you guys!!! 😭 Love from Carlsbad 🌊!!
Ann from How to Cook That sent me here, and I'm so happy about it!
The soup and cheesy bread look so delicious, and the way you do your videos are very relaxing. :)
It has been 4 years since I first saw your videos (Rainbow Sherbet to be exact)! It feels good to see how much you have been accomplished! Keep up the good work👌
Not a big fan of broccoli but i think this one is worth to try.
There is something about your and Rachel's video I find so calming. Definitely like the style and the content you guys are giving us. Keep up the work!
Hi byron, amazing garden you have there. Would love it if you could make a video regarding backyard gardening. Cheers!
this looks killer 😍my goodness.
You're just as great as your sweet wife!  Love me some Talbotts!
I love stir-fried broccoli leaves with garlic, it's as close as I can get to making garlic gai lan.
You deserve more subscribers..😍😍 love from india..❤
In Minnesota, we soak our garden-fresh broccoli over-night to get those green worms to crawl out.  Do you not have those hidden worms in your area?
You're so chill. Love this format!❤😊
Glad that I came across a cooking video from you three years ago. In which ever since then you have never disappointed me in learning a good new recipe!
MA sha allah that nice
Broccoli soup, my favorite!
This video was so interesting! Could you make a video where you use your chickens' eggs? I'm really curious to see how those eggs look :P
I am here because of your wife. :)
Looks so good! Had to rewind to see the cheese added, sneaky. Yum! Loved everything besides the sound of the metal spoon scraping the metal pot eeek lol! Nice to see Byron back
Love this filming style! Amazing recipe as always! Def gotta try this! 🙌🏼👏🏻
Love the videos, man.  Nice yard, too.  Kinda' jealous over here :)
I am so glad I found you today! Love everything about your videos! You got a New subscriber! Keep it up!
Looks amazing can't wait to try the recipe. Keep those videos going :-)
, greetings from the Netherlands
You're honestly one of my very favourite chefs! I tried many of your recipes, loved them!  Thanks for sharing your knowledge!
I stumbled upon your channel after being subscribed to Rachel for about 2 months and all I must say is.....I’m waiting on a Byron cooking show on Cooking Channel as well as a cook book!
Awesome recipe total comfort food! Also loved the live commentary fits a recipe like that perfectly. Keep it going!🤙🏻
Great recipes, lovely work...keep it up👌🏻...merry Christmas
Wow 😍!!! I cannot wait to make this. It looks incredible
My four year old, after watching you video and making this start-to-finish with me: "Dad! Do you know how to make broccoli cheddar soup? First you watch the MAN, and then you just make it!"
Love seeing you out in your garden and the soup looks amazing!!!
I’m really enjoying ur channel it’s so relaxing love your recipes too👍
I grow my own garden and was so excited to see your and the recipe you made with your harvest. Thank you for sharing
you can also use a rolling pin to crush the cardamom
Byron living the dream rn✨🌈
Do a video about your garden and chickens this year!!
I never realized that you and Rachel are connected. Then I saw the garden and the chickens and I had a deja vu, like I saw them before 😂
Wow, cardamom! Who would’ve thought. I will definitely try this. Thanks, Byron.
It has been 2 years since YouTube has displayed you on my feed and it's disappointing that occurred but glad to finally see your videos once more
Can you and Rachel do snacks for our loved ones 🐶💕?! Xoox
I love broccoli an cheddar soup. Thank you for sharing this video. Great garden.
I have always found your videos so relaxing to watch. Your cooking technique has always been a notch above. Absolutely loved the addition of getting to see where your ingredients come from for this particular recipe. Keep up the awesome content!
I just love the way you do your videos.
this looks amazing but the metal on metal was driving me nuts
I love the format ! My only recommendation would be making the audio a little louder. Great video as always! 😄
This looks so amazing, I need to try in right now
No fancysmanshie tools is the thing I like the most oops’s and all good content 🤘🏼
You put an extra l in film in the description mate. Just thought I’d tell you xxx
What is the brand of your stainless steel pot and how many quarts
Perfect for this cold weather 😍
I had no idea your yard was so extensive that is really cool.  I looked outside my back yard today.  Yup ready to harvest snow and ice haha.
dig this new format. well done!
I didn't get the notification for this video despite the bell icon being clicked. I only checked back because How to Cook That reminded me I haven't seen your last few videos. What's going on YouTube?
Is sharp cheddar the same as what we would call mature cheddar in the UK? That looked almost like a red leicester to me. Great recipe though the cardamom is a nice twist!
I love that you are growing your own produce ♥️🌿 can’t wait to try this! One day I want to have my own garden too just like that! I like that you are growing your produce in those pots since our actual ground (depending where you live) can be polluted with chemicals. I’ve tried some of your recipes and they all taste amazing. You should make a recipe book too or e-book with videos.
Just made this with prob the last of the broc out of our greenhouse - fabulous!
first video of yours that I’ve seen in awhile. I like the new format :) and omg this looks so amazing and simple
Beautiful garden!!!
This looks absolutely good. Gonna try it some time.
Ty for the recipe Byron!  You are a very talented chef and shall go far! ...and yes I am going to try it with store bought fresh Broccoli and maybe throw some fried up thick Crumbled Bacon Bits in.  Thanks again... your the BEST! :)
I'm surprised you don't put carrots in the soup! I like putting smoked paprika in my broccoli cheddar soup too.
AWESOME BYRON!!!!!  Send me some.  I don't feel like cookin!
Ur seriously my fave youtube channel! All this vibes, the amount of work you put into every videos. And dont even mention your voice:( so calming, so easy to understand. Ive been following you for years, and the quality just keep going up!
Love this content 💪🏽💪🏽👏🏽
Love your garden so much, great dad too I’m start follow you on Instagram too , great video and the soup 🥣 looks so delicious 😋
i love how every cooking video i watch that includes a rue i hear "just trying to cook the flour so you don't taste it. Just trying to thicken." lol great vids by this man though
His wife has to be one happy woman ❤️
You have a very beautiful house!
This is such an amazing change in video style! The soup looks amazing. Had some homemade broccoli soup a few weeks ago and was surprised I actually liked it because I don't think I've ever tried it until then...
I haven’t watched the entire video yet but wow. You have grown show much in the last few years. I started watching you before you had your first child, and you have all blossomed into something outrageously beautiful. Keep up the good work Byron 😊
Thank you the camera seems too far to see what you are doing sadly
iloveyou since i was 15 😭😭😭
So delicious! I love a good broccoli cheese soup recipe. Specially around this time of the year. I loved how you started off this video, was very interesting to see how you harvested your veggies. So cool!👌🏼🥦🧀🍵
Ever toss a green chile or two in there?
I dont know why but when I am hungry, I watch your videos. I dunno why! It just makes me more hungry! Why do I torture myself!!! Lol
that must be so good😭
Hi! Love your channel. Can you tell me where you got your butcher block cutting board?
I would have used the pepper grinder to grind all those spices together...
"I think its pretty good for them" they die the next day
Hullo! Been watching your channel for years and it’s the bees knees. Could you possibly make kunefe pretty please? Thanks for everything!
Not the best camera work from your videos.. so far from you and didn't even show the inside of the saucepan the whole time.
Looks amazing!!! Thank You perfect for this weather! I made some Gumbo the other day and last night, in the middle of the night, I had woken up and said BAY LEAF! I FORGOT THE BAY LEAF! 😂😂😂 all in all tho it was really good. So next soup/stew is going to be this!
I cannnot wait to have a garden, I love that garden you guys have
I cannnot wait to have a garden, I love that garden you guys have
This video is just so cute.☺️
Looks so yummi. Need to make this weekend! :)
Where do you get your knives and what do you use to sharpen them? Thank you!!
When your garden is finished for the year let your chickens into the beds. They will clean it up. In the spring they can turn the soil for you
Okay, this? Is the tastiest thing I've seen on YouTube in a long time. The soup looks really good, too.
Love the new format!
His wife is so lucky 😭
You are so inspirational, and so is Rachel.  Thank you.
Hey I came from the How to Cook That channel and I wonder why you’re never in my subscription feed anymore. You’re an amazing chef and I love your videos but why does YouTube make your videos so inaccessible? #SaveYouTubeBaking
Now I’m starving by looking at that soup......😋
VERY GOOD VIDEO, I LOVE COOK TOO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEXT RECIPE
Eating anything you grow always taste better. (sometimes, still can't grow cucumbers right). I like watching videos like this. Thanks.
love you're channel
mix parmesan with cheddar make it tastier
Love the format of this video! I always love your videos, but especially when you make my favorites dishes. Yum!
i find this relaxing
1.4 Million subscribers and only 20K views in your videos? This channel‘s dead 💀
Love the format!!
Serious goals ❤️
wow love your channel !
doesn't this burn the milk?
I'm here for the garden shots. My broccoli in the garden is still weeks out, but if some are about to go to flower I'm totally making this recipe! Enjoy growing from seed! It's the best to see little sprouts emerge.
This looks incredible !
stopped watching when he added cardamon...
So great one of my favorite soups
Cheeeeseeee yayyyyyy 🤤🤤🤤
one of the most beautiful things i’ve ever seen
Great video Bryon😍
Not nearly as good with store bought as I imagine fresh from the garden to be. The broccoli flavor was a bit lost in the creamy base and I was drowning in rich, so I added the juice and zest from a Meyer lemon (what I had on hand) and it really kicked the broccoli up and cut through the cream.  I can't wait to try when my farmers market comes back!
Would you recommend a vitamix blender over a Ninja?
Did anyone notice he opened the gate but like 10 feet away it was opened lol
I love your broccoli soup
I wish I liked broccoli
I like this format, I love your videos
A piece of bread is a vehicle for deliciousness. That's poetic, what a wonderful way of thinking.
Great video. Loved the garden
It looks super appetising. Will make a Keto version of it. Yum!
Yum 🤤
Some great home cooking
I would have to load that up with cheddar cheese. Of course I would overpower the soup with the flavor of the cheddar.
I made it and absolutely loved it. One question though, would using almond milk or coconut milk be okay flavour wise? A friend wants to try it but she doesn't drink or eat dairy products
My goodness, can you be my internet husband? I love you cooking style!! Keep it going.
Such great content
Wow you pretty much set up a farm. That’s awesome.
Yummmm!!!!!
Mumble mumble mumble when you get in the kitchen lost me.
Yummmmy
Watching this at 12 midnight 😭😭
what are u a farmer bod?
Very nice.
Hermoso video de verdad
That's a cool little set up.
♥ ♥
this looks awesome. I definetely want to try it out, but where I'm from it's really hard to find different cheeses. For cheddar I can only find pre sliced processed "american cheese". What cheese would you guys suggest as a substitute? Never had sharp cheddar so don't know what it tastes like to compare to something else.
Great thx
1234!!!!
Who just wants a bite of that right now?
Damn, baby.
Dilf for sure
freshly picked for extra enzymes :)
Nice
More like besciamella broccoli
what a wholesome video!
Im hungry now
Did you not use cheddar? Is that why it’s called broccoli cheese soup?
Very nice video!
Why didn’t you harvest the cheese too 😠

Poor cheese, always stands alone.
Put down that cup, dude.
great recipe, but I personally like the old style videos more then this one, don't know why but I was drawn to your channel by the old style and really liked the voice over for the cooking steps and letting the pictures speak with nice shots, it also made you a bit more unique to other chefs on youtube that mostly do this video kind of style. so hope that you will still keep your old style mostly and this new style only from time to time.
Did anyone else find this video almost... a little awkward?
Byron again with another great video!!! tapioca pudding is amazingggg!! (:
I never had something like this. Looks good, gotta try it!
We here in India also do something similar but with cow/buffalo milk, sugar , soaked tapioca in water ; all cooked together into a porridge like consistency and had as a desert. And for flavouring we add cardamom or nutmeg and some dry fruit slivers for garnishing.
Excellent and unusual! Love when you analyze and dissect what you make in your tasting process.
I never knew I needed this dish in my life until now! 😍😍 Its like an extra fancy rice pudding. Peaches instead of citrus would be heavenly too. So many possibilities.
I love tapioca I have never heard of using coconut milk that is a great idea I'm going to have to try that used to be my favorite dessert while I was pregnant thank you
I'm Assuming you used Cow Milk in this Recipe?
Also, if these recipes are yours (sry I don’t know but I assume that they are yours), go to MasterChef right now







 
No joke actually
im going to try this as coconut rice pudding instead cus I don't have tapioca rn. looks delicious!
Where do I find the canister that you used to make whipped cream so fast n eady? 🤔😊
Ooo looks really mouthwatering 🤤




Except for peaches 🤢I don’t like them


Sorry😭







It is okay because without the peaches (edit: citrus I mean)I would want that RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!
Every time I see a recipe for tapioca pudding, I think of Sheldon’s insistence that tapioca is lethal if prepared incorrectly. 😂 lol. This looks delicious though!!
Hi, next time try soaking the tapioca pearls for 2 hours before cooking - by doing that, the pearls cook fast and even; and they also become so fluffy... it is so common in southern India to make tapioca pearls kheer (sweet porridge) 
! love your videos :)
Merci beaucoup pour cette vidéo......TOP 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
Woohoo, I was the 1st official like!  Love Tapioca pudding!  Love your videos!
Hi Byron 
Please try some Indian Cuisine for your videos
Why so much work? Are these bids for pros?
Just for the curiosity aspect of the thing: 
the pronunciation in the word tapioca is with an different sound in the "O". It's not like in "oval" it's more like "owl". (There is a symbol for this phonetically but I don't have it in my cellphone keyboard lol)

If you put the word in Google translator you could hear the Brazilian portuguese original pronunciation.

 It's a word that comes from our native Brazilians, from their Tupi-Guarani language. They are one of the various different people that lived here before European people came. Some tribes still live in our forests nowadays, eating tapioca and other mandioca (maniva) products. 
Here in Brazil tapioca is very common and we eat mandioca in it's many forms in a regular basis. Is a really good an nutritious food. Glad to see other people trying and enjoying it too 🙂
I absolutely love tapioca pudding this looks so amazing! A lot of people I meet hate tapioca but Its always a favourite in all its forms 😍
That pudding looks really good. Hope you have a Merry Christmas, Byron.
That looks very refreshing.  I love the presentation and the little bowl you served it in.  Where might I find those bowls?
Um... tapioca-coconut milk proportions in printed recipe are waaaay off! I just wasted a whole can of coconut milk on this.
OMG Can't wait to try this one. Thanks for all your vids. Hope you have a nice one.
Looks delicious but some of the recipes are too intricate
I just had this yesterday. I made it just water and sugar. It's great for Digestion.
My mouth is watering 😍
Beautiful video as always.  Love that garnish.
OMMMG, it’s gonna be so good for the summer season now, can’t wait to try it!!!!
Looks really nice I’ll try it out
Omg I bet this is so amazing
this looks so gooood!!!
always love your videos
How do you like you Miyabi's? I love mine!
This is a common dessert my mum used to make (without the fruit etc.) for us! yum.
This looks so good. What is tapioca?
Aww it looks so delicious! I'd love to try this. btw I wanna know what knife sharpener you use, please?
Gorgeous video as usual! The knife you use to cut the citrus is just beautiful! What is it? It almost looks like a vintage Japanese knife, beautiful lines!
Did you use CO2 for the whiipped cream? Sure it is not N2O?
0:48 I wish chefs wouldn't do that
te la comes
Nice and fresh! Love it! 😉
Yum!
❤👌
Drool..
No, you look good.
I bought everything to make this but the instructions for the tapioca pearls say to soak them overnight. Is this necessary? Also, my coconut milk is already sweetened so do I need to further sweeten it with sugar while it’s boiling? Thank you!! Can’t wait to try this!
looks so yummy
I would eat it, i love Tapioca Pudding!
It looks in the video like it is 1/4 cup of small pearl tapioca, and not 1 cup as listed in the ingredients list. Looking at other similar recipes online give the same ratio
#notificationgang♥️♥️
جميل  😊
Could I use almond milk?
first like!
Beautifull!
I just made this today. I felt it was bland. It needs something.
1st
❤❤❤❤
Question. Is it ok to use saran wrap on hot dishes especially when it’s touching the food? Will some of the chemical leak into the dish or no?
Ooo... I want to try to make an AIP version of this since tapioca is AIP compliant! I will make a coconut whipped cream instead and I’m assuming I can use honey instead of agave?  😋
Wow yummy 😋
Come visit, I have very tasty and healthy. YOU WILL NOT REGRET)
What brand/type coconut milk....and orange blossom cream. Do you have a link for the whipped cream canister you use? Thanks
I made this. so easy, yet so delicious. I topped mine with mango. Yum
I only got to 1 min, 36 second of your vid. The cinemetography and editing is superb! I liked on that basis alone. Keep making vids, you trump the other popular chef vids on  YTube.  If you are DIY or have a personal editor... keep doing what youre doing. It's solid! HMU if youre dumb enough to see this 😎😉
I'd play with your coconuts and let you tapioca this, Byron.
More of these Line Cook inspired videos. I'm a line cook
Thanks for showing us how to prep risotto like you do in a restaurant. If you can do more dishes like this (make ahead and finished a la minute) that would be awesome!
Hope you guys enjoyed my take on butternut squash risotto! Anyone have any special risotto secrets out there let me know in the comments!!
3:49 gluten? In rice?
Beautiful dish chef
Your knife cuts are so satisfying 😍😩
From a French Canadian cooking student, so nice to see you cooking with WINE (one of my favorite food groups, WINE!) :) . This one's going in my favorites and I'm so going to try this and add to my repertoire. We're into the white sky dandruff days so this recipe shall do well for us. Cheers!
Nothing is more satisfying than cutting cubed food lol
I love risotto. Fabulous, fall flavours in the risotto you made. Cheers, Byron.
The cubes of squash make me really happy...
I make my risotto in my instant pot and I really like it! Def not "legit" but tastes great to me! I'll have to try it the old fashioned way again soon, though because this looks so tasty!!
I'd let you squash and butternut on me, Byron.
this looks hearty and comforting. perfect meal for the kind of weather we're having in nyc right now!
Those squares of squash are satisfying to look at
i would make a squash puree and mix in with the rice. Now this is just plain risotto with cubes of squash, not that squashy in my opinion
Looks amazing and super simple! I can't wait to try it!
STOP SAYING 'RISODE-OH'!
'Clean your plate edge you dirty..... '  Ramsay would say
You should do more Dinner recipes. Going through all your videos, there's not that many, and there's no Dinner playlist
I still love this channel. The quality and love that goes into it is amazing.
Thank you for this recipe 🤗🌹 
Greetings 
Chef khawla from Bahrain (GCC  Middle east)
Lighting was really fantastic it added a "time" affect to the video. I really liked it. In general this video had a lot of very useful information. Thank you Mr. Talbott.
Thank you for this because in my production class we actually made risotto but when I made it, it turned out crunchy so I guess I didn’t add enough chicken stock.
more of these line cook recipes, please!!
I love how neat and organized you are with your cooking.
Good! Looks delicious ∴∵ゞ(´ω`*)♪
Practically the same way I do it but I appreciate the line cook, par cook method. I’m going to try that next time.
I roast my butternut cubes and I I use the squash guts (minus the seeds) to heat in my chicken broth for extra flavor. 
Once I had butternut squash ravioli and they garnished the top with raw sage leaves! So not good! I always sauté mine.
I prefer the natural lighting with its subtle lighting changes in videos, it adds to the in home cooking idea
Omg, that looks awesome 👍👍
My favorite!!!! Unfortunately is way to hard .. 😫🥴
Metal spoon in non stick again. It kills me.
Excellent dice on that squash!
3:47 Risotto or rice in general doesn’t contain any gluten 🙄
Wow didn't even need to watch vid to give big thumbs up! Course i will watch tho. 😁 

Keep them vege/plant-based recipes rollin.
With longer hair you'd look like the Jesus in most biblical movies.  Great lookin Risotto!
This was very interesting! Really enjoyed this video. Would love to see more like it. It's very helpful for at home meal prep
When i make pumpkin risotto i always put some pumpkin in the stock and blitz with a hand held blender. The colour makes presentation more festive
Did you fall off a bike or something? looks like you hit your head
totally in love with this style of video
Ahhhh you Butternut Squash me!!! 🦶👀
That risotto looks beautiful and delicious!! 😊🙂
looks a lot like avantgardevegan/Gaz Oakleys butternut squash risotto though...
I like to purée some of the squash for a more even flavor and color.
"rizoe-dough" lol :D
Hey, Byron, you inspired me to become a pastry chef. I'm in Texas and am in currently in a community college.  You always do such a great job at presentation and have such a skilled hand.
Love this! This looks like a risotto worth making and eating!
Great dish! and content!  Question!  Have you ever thought about pureeing a small amount of butternut squash with some of the chicken stock and adding a little to the finished Risotto in the pan?  Just to get some more of the butternut squash taste in there?
Please do more of those.
Hey, Byron! Hope you're well!
Classy and elegant
Why did you put the risotto in the fridge?
😋 Yummy, I try 👍🏻😉👌🏻Thanks
Very nice recipe chef
So that’s how they do it on Hell’s Kitchen... thanks Byron!
that looks so delicious what a fantastic job. why don't you do a leftover Thanksgiving specialty sandwich next:)
really liked the restaurant behind the scenes perspective on things. Would love more videos like these to gain more insight on how popular dishes are actually prepped in a restaurant setting!!
In a restaurant would the prepared food be kept in the fridge or room temp?
What happened around your right eye?
very good chef!!!
Yum 😋
Wow I make mine the homemade way and definitely will not order this at a restaurant.  I always thought they made it fresh but of course not that would take lots of time....good to know! Definitely appreciate these videos.
New hair!
Ugh why don’t you have a book yet!? - my husband has been making your pancakes for Pancake Sunday for the past couple years and anytime we have pancakes anywhere else, we think they kind suck! 😂 love your recipes. We need a book!! ❤️
Second 💕❤💙
Made this last night! Super creamy and delicious! I would love to know how long a risotto should typically take to make. Mine took over an hour because I was afraid of adding too much liquid too quickly.
I'm happy to see back.
Can you do some line cook talks. Kinda like this guy Justin Khanna on youtube. Im an up and coming cook and i wanna get better on the line
Delicious 😋
Lovely!
Hi first pinnnn plz
Very good video
Yes, a vegan recipe! More please ♥️
Thank u for doing a vegan recipe 😍😍
Awesome to see a vegan recipe!
I'm not a vegan but I enjoy a meatless meal like this on occasion. Looks delish! :)
Thank you for doing a vegan dish.  Would love to see more options like this!
Lasagna was always just spaghetti flavored cake to me but this is on a whole nother level!!!
Thank you for another great vegan recipe! Will definitely make this for Thanksgiving.
Had no idea such a thing existed and when first reading the title thought you where making lasagna with squash and acorns :D hahaha
Please create more vegan recipes! The apple whiskey doughnuts you uploaded were fanned over and people begged me for the recipe!
Yesss.. definitely making this. more vegan recipes please!
I searched your channel and the pasta you make uses eggs so that means this wouldn't be vegan if you use the same recipe.
Oh my gosh I am totally going to make this!! Thank you for making a vegan recipe!!
Thank you for the vegan recipe #moreplease not to sound greedy 😉
Yussss, a vegan recipe. Looks delicious!
🙌🏼 🌱
Yesss i love this!!! More vegan recipes please!!!
Hi from Quebec, Canada! This looks delicious! 😊
This looks so good!  Great crunch and I always loved how much you can do with all the different Squashes out there.  Very nice job on this sir!  Chris
Yum more vegan savory recipes 😊
Yay another vegan recipe
I love lasagna. You made a great looking lasagna. Cheers Byron.
I noticed you are using chix towel. My work told me that it has sanitizer in it. Thought you would like to know. 🤗😮
Been following the channel for years ( even when your wife was on ). Most complicated thus far
Byron, your recipes are in the next level of smart cooking! Love it 😁
Oh my gosh, this looks like perfection! I love acorn squash
YES! more vegan recipes. Beautiful flavors
love love love that you've been doing some vegan recipes <3 hope to see more!
وصفه صحيه وممتازة 👍
May I ask where you bought this incredible butcher block/the wood cutting board? Looking for a good quality one, with great color and wear. Yours looks great..
This looks amazing! Thank you Byron!
What a fantastic recipe! This channel is one of the best. Especially enjoy the review of your own recipes at the end.
Can't find Acorn squash anywhere ... Whole Foods and Trader Joe's both let me down... 😞
That looks delicious..please make more vegan recipes...
Oh man, this really looks fantastic!!
Have you been watching Dr Berg videos. That is the only way I found out about nutritional yeast.
I love all you’re recipes ❤️
🤤🤗🤤this looks unbelievable 💛
Please make ravioli recipes!!
Plz do more veg vids! I love u and miss watching u 💘💘
Superb 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Good Packers
Hey Byron!  Great recipe.  I just wanted to add that I always add some light miso when making cashew cream as it really helps boost the umami factor.  My typical cashew cream uses cashews, nutritional yeast, miso and vegetarian chicken stock (+ seasoning as needed).  Definitely check it out, miso has definitely upped my vegan/vegetarian game.
Look so yummy and great recipe 🙆🙆
I love the little cooking tray you used for it
definitely going to make this next week!
Looks amazing Byron, will have to try this one out.
I love your all recipe...
Damn you get some of the most elite sponsors...
Perfect fall food
yes yes and more yes
Really nice video. Creative
goals
Looks really delicious
Please link the video that shows how to make Vegan pasta?
Please post a strawberry short cake recipe
Great idea!
The ingredients call for flour but I don’t see flour in the video. Did I miss it?
Canola oil is one of the most toxic things you can consume. Just use all olive oil!
good effort boss
Is this keto?
😍😍😍
Hi!!! Yummy!THX Q: Sherlock buy the iron metal dish?
Man, this looks terrible.  But im not a vegan so my opinion is pretty irrelevant here.
oh my oh my oh my oh my sexy vegan lasagna
Un vegan qui a des morpions peut il se gratter les couilles ???
Love your videos. Although not traditional with dinner service, I felt this was crying out to be eaten with a spoon with those little individual deep containers. Knife and fork felt like trying to shovel snow with a pitchfork. Also, I’d peel the acorn squash. Not that hard to do and I don’t like to waste one bit of it.
Yummy😊
What can I do to substitute the cashew “ricotta”? I can’t eat any nuts at all!
I appreciate the vegan recipe, though I wouldn't consider this "easily made".  Also, IMO nutritional yeast has a tangy and nutty, not cheesy, flavor, just so people don't get disappointed.  But it does create a pleasant, savory taste in it's own right.
It looks delicious and keep up with the videos because I watched your videos back in 2012-2013 and it will make me sad if you can’t keep up with the videos ❤️❤️❤️
My nonna makes REAL lasagna...... I don't know what this is
Byron! After the straining process, the solid cashew becomes cashew ricotta? Did you add anything else to make it “ricotta”? I just want to make sure cause you said in the video: “after the ricotta is done, season with...” I didn’t see you do anything else after separation between milk and solid part. Am I missing something? Definitely going to make this this weekend since I have on Acorn Squash laying around!
Love your channel and your family! 💞
Vegan!!! Vegan??? Where is this world heading to... Where?!?
Fresh ricotta is so easy and tastes so different than store bought.  What is the texture/flavor profile of a squash blossom?  I’m imagining chewing on a dandelion and it doesn’t sound appetizing 😂😂
This looks deliciously amazing!!
Would love to see a vegetarian lasagna recipe!
I tried deep fried squash blossom before. I would love to try it again but my grandparents would hate to pick blossoms just before they become squash.
Where tf do you get squash blossoms?
this looks very delicious :)
I watch you because your beautiful, I just wanna let u know.

No homo tho
Hi from Chile! I was wondering which camera do you use for your videos? by the way i love you videos. You explain everything just perfect!
You are the king of cooking❤
besides the pasta loved the background music a lot...
Bro your recipes look bangan asfu always 😋🔥💯👌
That looks delicious. Do you ever do vegan or non-dairy dishes? I'd love to see some of your tasty recipes for those of us who are lactose intolerant :P
Thank you! My grocery store in the middle of nowhere just had a sale on squash blossoms!
Amazing seasonal recipe
Thanks for the recipe, looks delish
A beautiful and colourful vegetarian disn! Thanks
I need idea to serve for appetizer on Thanksgiving
Stuff and fry the blossoms! Teach us!
more pasta dishes that arent traditional italian, more experimentation/ad lib like this. <3
I love the serenity and techniques you use to create a dish. I like the simplicity of this dish, delicious. Thank you!
Fantalicious! This sounds absolutely delightful and, a bonus, something I can actually recreate. Thanks
I am so going to try this next summer when my squash plants are blooming!!! Also what about adding a few fresh mushrooms??
Too bad squash blossom season is done where I live in Northwest PA...however, I’ll try the pasta!
This is one of my favorite dishes! As an Italian I must say you are one of the few non italian chefs that put up recipes that really are true to our Italian cuisine. The only difference I notice is that you love a stronger garlic flavor, by adding chopped garlic, we do that with very few pasta dishes in Italy. What we usually do is put the whole garlic, just smashed, in restaurants they even remove the core of the garlic (don't know what you would call that in English) so that there is just a hint of it. But anyways thank you for your videos, love both yours and your wife's channel, huge fan. Ciao from Italy!
looks amazing. Something Williams-Sonoma would probably feature in their website.
Another vid so soon! I'll take it.
Could you use Butternut squash instead?
Thank god a new recipe
That looks so friggen delicious.
Can you show us how to make ricotta fresh????
한국인 소리질뤄~~
Well Byron if you want it close to sea water, then use Sea salt!
Such a sophisticated dish Byron ✌🏻😊
Although it's nothing similar, growing up my mom would make flor de izote (izote flower) with chorizo and veggies and it was delicious! This recipe inspired me to give this a try a well(:  Also, your videos are soooo aesthetically pleasing.
Wish I have a handsome husband like you
Ayy this dude still exists.
I would be scared af if my food caught fire like that
What is a squash blossom?
Should have added more of the starchy pasta water when finishing it up with the herbs and blossoms. It looks too dry
Is that fresh hand dipped ricotta?
looks dry af
Look beautiful to serve delicious to eat
That looks really delicious.
Looking yummy 😆.
I’d love to see a chicken mushroom fettuccine dish
2:06 editing mistake x
Nice recipe great idea.
Super duper🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗❤❤❤❤❤
Pasta!
Is it just me or did I just find my new husband
What does a squash blossom taste like?
Which ingredient add the flavour? I mean, most of the ingredients are bland or with mild flavour?  Is the dish more about the texture than flavour?
I want a lamb video
he seems to be taking his divorce pretty well
Awesome
bich🍜
Looks bland AF
Omg nice simple yum yum😊
Oh wow very seasonal, we're in October honey blossoms are long gone.
i wish i wouldn't hear you chewing you animal
Anyone that actually puts seasoning in their pasta or cooking knows this is the most basic white food you could ever eat.
Do a collaboration with binging with babish
It’s like art come to life when Byron cooks!  Love his cooking  and channel ❤️
There's something really satisfying about watching you take a bite! 😂 
(In a totally non-creepy way)
Im going to try it with coconut almond milk
i'd eat it, but the classic shrimp po boy has ice burg lettuce and tomato
I absolutely love everything you make, I’ve tried a couple they turned out great
Thank you fo sharing your amazing recipes... God bless
Wet hand / dry hand
As usual ... Love you, dude.... But! Did you count the bowls? Way too many! Not practical!
I don’t like shrimp or any seafood, but I like you so I’ll give this video a like 😁👍🏻
So you left the tails on and ate them? 🤔
My mom uses coconut oil to fry foods—unrefined, unprocessed coconut oil. And everything has a nutty flavor that’s to die 😍 I will use your recipe but switch out the oil!
Love it! Those were some amazing looking shrimp.
you didnt say "MM" after the first bite like you usually do...3:20
Your food is making me so hungry. Fantastic is an understatement. Cheers, Byron.
I just can't describe how much I loved the simplicity in the recepie and it'd have been better if the video was a little longer... IMO.
this isn't a po'boy.......
Looks delicious! I love that your recipes are always so quick, easy and right to the point.
He always done everything classy and elegant
Thanks for making this delicious recipe. A good follow up to the million dollar truffle pizza 😋
I made lots of modifications because not all the ingredients are available where i live. The coconut addition is just 😍! I had two sandwiches with no guilt!
Could you do a Prawn (Shrimp) based pasta dinner dish please?
Very simple to make, I can't wait to try this. Thanks
Nice RHCP tee, Byron!
What if you replace canola with coconut oil
Looks like some decent breaded shrimp, but don't call it a Po boy.
Shrimp Po Boy: 
1. Saute shrimp with butter, garlic, Cajun seasoning.
2. French roll with a slather of mayo
3. Top with shrimp, shredded lettuce, dill pickle chips, and a splash of Crystal hot sauce 
4. Done
Looks easy and delish, as we can see. Gone! We put out our 100th cooking vid yesterday Byron.  We made your french onion soup!
Great! I was looking for a recipe for coconut shrimp yesterday!
Clean plate club ;-)
Not a Po'boy, but looks like a nice sandwich.
It's really very easy and tasty .thank you
Do collaboration with chefstep.the shrimps want the sous vide!
I am definitely trying this recipe next! I know some people in the comment section are complaining about the amount of coconut in the recipe, but I personally think it’s the perfect amount. Coconut definitely has a strong taste as is, and think this is the perfect balance to get all the flavors to flow together. Thank you for this recipe! 
By the way, I love yours and Rachel’s channels! Some of my favorite by far.
Psa u got a typo in the description
I like me some shrimp, these look good!!
Then you left the shell on the tails on........ WOW. Then proceeded to eat it WOW.
Glad i have air fryer 😁
I just saw tje tatoo on ypur hand and i eould like to ask if you have any relation tp greece bec i am frpm greece
Love how easy this recipe is!
Basically I don't cook.. In my place we can't find the ingredients which u mention or prescribe.. But I love ur way of cooking, i mostly love ur order management while processing ur cooking. And I love ur kitchen the most.. Tx tybot following yu more than a year but dis is my first comment
Man, this dude has great production and finesse but his recipes are abysmal. These might as well be fried shrimp, because no one is gonna be able to taste that tiny amount of coconut blitzed into the breadcrumbs. Much less combined with an adobo pepper spread.
Nice! My son has an egg allergy so what else can I use to substitute??
The right crunch delicious enjoy now I’m hungry need to eat my boring sandwich 🥪
Thank you 🙏🏻 I am going to try😋😋😋💚💋Thanks you are awesome 👏
Uploading my first video today go check it out !!!
Those look good!! I would have eaten both also 😋
Yum, will give it a try!
First love you 😍
These are some yummy looking breaded shrimps, i wish i had some to make this recipe
What's with the random frame at 2:37? Just sitting there smiling lool
Brian, there was an awesome beats dish that you re-created from a french chef (Daniel Boulud) a while back. What is that video called, i really want to re-create it too.
This seems easy and affordable to make
Is it true you can eat the tail if it's been fried? Anybody?
Woww look so delicious😘
Rockstar!  :)
Looks so delicious!
This isn't a pop boy, Its a Banh Mi. Still looks good though.
Awesome job
I didn’t know your wife did YouTube until I noticed the same kitchen and I was like oh
Yum!
Does processing the breadcrumbs and coconut keep the coconut from burning! I made some the other day, and the tips were a little too charred.
Look delicious.
😍😍
Do U have a spicy mayo recipe?
Looks delish and I would totally eat this but it isn’t a classic Louisiana Po’Boy. Us Louisianians are simple. Must be French bread. We use fish fry on shrimp and lettuce, tomato and remoulade sauce or plain mayo.
anyone else notice him at 2:35
Can you eat tails?
So tasty
Yummy!!
I’m gonna give it a try 👌👌
Are you trying to pull off the clean plate club from Babish? I don’t know you’d have to collaborate with him and ask him first
Dear chef why does it name po boy?
Yummy 😋 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Creamy potato scallops please
Nah blood
Wow yummy  ❤😊
Nice hot dog presentation))
this aint a poboy :|
Can you translate it in Spanish so my cousin's can now ! Please 🙏 And before you ask I can't speak Spanish lol !
perfect timing, I was wondering what to do with all the spare truffle I had lying around
I remember when I was 10 and  was staying at my grandparents farm and my cousin picked up something that she claimed was a black truffle and took a bite and it was a horse poop chunk, they do look very similar, that was 15 years ago, she never had truffle again
Watching this video while chewing on my amazing banana
so your saying this pizza is gonna be stupid expensive to make then?
When you want a $100 pizza.
Can we just appreciate the art of cooking Byron shows?!?! Amazing!!!
thank you for the wide variety in videos you put out for us. i love the techniques and flavor combinations and different ingredients you use that i wouldn’t know/ think about using. all these people complaining is hilarious, don’t let them get to you. i now have a new dough recipe and new sauce recipe to try. i’ve been watching you for years now and have no complaints thank you Byron 😊 also i love your wife’s channel as well you guys are both so creative and the boys are adorable. 😊
Byron, I love your site. I visit it often and have made a number of your dishes. Problem here is, I can't afford truffles!
Oh man, look at all this truffle I don't have :(
Black truffles!? If you CAN'T affort this dish. Like this comment...
Thankyou for putting a lot of effort & passion in to it. I really enjoyed watching.  Loved the final result. Much love ❤
I have Italian supermarkets in my city, in Canada. I tried truffle cheese. It was really good. I love truffles. That pizza looks great. Cheers Byron.
Loving it Byron another great peace of art 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
Mr Talbott,
please please bake a TOURTEAU FROMAGER.
You are my BEST and favorite chef , the one I  Know in YOUTUBE, your way of cooking, teaching and describing the processes is very special. Gob bless you. Thank you
Soooo good! Congrats.
Truffle oil really taste good? Worth it?
Yo dawg! Your videos should get way more views.
Thanks for showing me this recipe.....HOW MANY OF US CAN AFFORD TO BUY A TRUFFLE 💰💰
Clicked on the video, looked at the recipe: "Oh, it's for the 1% who can afford that much truffle." Bounced.
I don't have truffles, but it sure looks amazing
Oh my goodness! Truffle pizza???!!!
It looks amazing to serve to guest with a classy taste for truffle,  me personally love truffles. It’s an ingredient you must enjoy is costly great job.
Pizza loaded with truffle, spicy
Black truffles are $95 an ounce...
You must have had the best trip lol great stuff brother
Expensive, no doubt, but not the least bit appetizing.
Let’s be friends? I’ll do the dishes?!
Okay...hands down, this is the best food porn channel on YouTube. Thank you!!!
Yum! That Pizza looks really good! 👍
Price of truffles included in pizza?
REALLY craving this now.
Hi from indonesia.
Let me now how to make pizza dough without mechine???
When you only have pepperoni 😭
Love the videos! We want to see your kid again so cute!
I cAnT aFfOrD tHe TrUfFlE, how about making the pizza and not adding truffle? People just don't have common sense.
Just curious how much was the truffles you bought?
Looks delicious!!  What brand of cookware and knife ware do you use?
يم يمي 😍😋
Your the best chef ever🤗
One of my favorite pizzas
Nice... now I'm hungry for something with truffles in it..
I never thought of using bechamel on a pizza dough... definitely will try it!
Hi Byron, I am a viewer from Taiwan and really enjoy the way you cook/present the food!! 

Understand some people gave you comments on the new elements/ideas you put out in the previous videos. Although suggests drive us to be better but I would say...you are perfect in God’s eyes. So, keep doing what brings you joy the most!!  

God bless you and your family!🙏💪
Most delicious and most expensive pizza 😁👌🏻
Actually had some spare truffle in oil and truffle honey from italy i got cheap there so i will hopefully be  making a yummy version of this
Byron, what happened to the shack?
First
LOVE LOVE your videos and Rachel’s also! You all need a show on HGTV or FoodNetwork!
The first time I ate truffle was on a pizza. I didn't like how the truffle tasted, but many people love it on pizza :)
Damn, that looks sooo good!
بيترا. 🍕🍕
Looks delicious Bryon. $$$$$$$$$ I don't think I'm dressed right for this Recipe.
Came to watch more out of curiosity, came away with a cool pizza dough recipe I want to try out for my next pizza.
This tastes better than it looks 😅 lol
I bet it doesn’t even taste good lmao
Omg ur a awesome  cook
Remember when he did like 5 inane versions of Steak and Potatoes? Yes, that's when the slow decline began.
Is it true that truffles smell like feet?
What containers do you use to store spices
That looks amazing! We've been making a pile of pizzas over on our channel... but nothing as extravagant as this; can't wait to give it a try!
2:04 😋
triple truffle
What camera do you use
God this looks delicious!
Can everybody who is complaining about the fact that he's using truffle just shut up?? He is an artist! Let him be and express his amazing ideas and creations, please!!  
Hi Byron, I'm your long time fan from Bali, Indonesia. I alwayssss enjoy each of your videos. You have genius ideas and I love watching your videos. Keep up the good work!!!
Oh I want to try that soooo badly!
If I were rich
Where do you buy truffles???  I've never even seen them for sale.
Really dude who watching this is gonna make this pizza no one
What camera do you use?
Don't mind the hate people are leaving on here! I certainly have appreciated all of the videos you have posted, affordable or pricey! I enjoy the quality of your videos and the attention to detail in editing. Your videos I feel caters to everyone's curiosity, most especially to rare food like this truffle. So please don't stop creating awesome videos like this because of self pitying morons who can't understand unique creativities!
Omg drool 😋
Where do you even get truffle? I'm too poor to even afford to know. Lol another great video byron. hope you enjoyed this for all of us followers
i'm from naples,and this is horrible
Yumm☹️♥️
😍😍😍😍😍😍
It's sad how his channel is slowly dying.  I liked it best years ago. No idea what went wrong though honestly. Although, if i had to really try hard, I would say it was the type of recipes he chose? In the past, most of them were popular dishes well known. Now it's more about creating beautiful interpretations of dishes that aren't really often shown on youtube. And i get that. But, people aren't going to search for those. Like a Carbonara video is surely going to rake in so much more views than this. I'm certainly not going to key in "Johnny cakes' or "tuna tartare bagels" like his last two videos. Which is a shame. I still support this channel, but i've realised that i click much less now.
Looks great!
yum
i would love to try and eat one but too much $$$ :(
Some people just hate mushrooms but why?
It’s my Sensei!!! Amazing as always man!
Hey mate! Nice vid. Quick question. I’ve worked out that all the Jarred truffle products taste amazing due to an aroma added called “2,4-dithiapentane ” or something that they add in. And when I’ve tried fresh truffles, there is no taste. Are truffles a scam?
Why u didn’t write the olive oil and the truffle oil in the ingredients? And how many gram we should use.
chinese black truffle no good
Needs some meat. Vegetarian food sucks. I put a pork chop in my coffee every morning and you want me to eat a 6 billion dollar vegetarian pizza. You must be smoking truffles
wow
yeahhh .... this is a dish you'd only make for your closest of friends
$90 from DiGiorno, $145 from Pizza Hut. 4 or 5 years ago when you did video w your wife, you were more frugal and practical
WOW i've never seen onions used for a bechamel base.. maybe im basic and it's definitely a thing.. but thats so cool... i always use flour and olive oil cooked together then add almond milk... then i melt in the vegan cheese... i make a vegan bechamel :) its bomb... what is the difference when you use onions instead of an oil/butter?
People complaining about the cost of truffles are so stupid. I thought this episode was gonna be sponsored by Boboli pre made crusts though.
One expensive, delicious pizza 🍕👍 WORTH IT!
YOU DONT COOK TRUFFELS!  ONLY TRUFFLE OIL!
Im always too cheap to eat king crab any way but plain but this looks SO delicious 🤤🤤🤤
That sandwich looks really impressive. Great job Byron.
 
There was a fisherman who accidentally dropped a candy bar he was eating into the sea. Two clams raced for the candy bar, and one of them got to it first and quickly ate it up. The other clam said, "Aren't you being a bit too shellfish?"
King crab is truly the king of seafood. Love your show man. Always look forward to what you got cooking up.
i liked and commented...and i 've not even see the clip!!!!
I'm eating right now and still got hungry after this video, how?
byron you recently became my favorite youtuber. GREAT videos my man!!!
I'm so hungry now,need to go for dinner.what a delicious sandwiches.thank you
That 'crabby patty' comment/joke was the best! I actually LOL'ed!! Great looking sandwich by the way!!!🦀🍔🤭😆👨‍🍳
Awesome sandwich man, love some king crab.
Now this makes me hungry!🤤
Looks so good!😯
Can't wait to try it out!! 😍❤️
I love how you cook! You make everything look so tasteful!  Congrats!
That looks delicious!!
You make everything look so easy always delicious
COOK me a crab sandwich, and make it SNAPPY.
Man, I’m not even a fan of seafood/crustacean, and you have my mouth watering
Hi Bryon. Looking forward to try this one OMG!!!! Thanks for the recipe.
That is one sexy samich!
That looks DELICIOUS! Future video request: Shrimp Paté. 😉😘
Beautiful sandwich.
Oh hell yeah! Curse this land locked state and small town I live in! 🦀 I need you!
Byron, come over I'll make you a delicious "Imitation Crab" Sandwich!! Haha.. Loved all the cracking sounds during the vid, perfect for Halloween.... Nice vid sir looks amazing.
That bread alone looks good. Now add the crab to it. 🤤🤤 Ugh, I can’t lol
I just love to watch all of your video:-)
Im dying! GOD i need something to eat fast! this made me so hungry 😂❤
Well... time to build a boat so I can float down my stream of drool 🤤😍
Yum yum yum!!! Our seafood is EXPENSIVE here and I don’t even know if we can get King Crab here but 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
This looks so delicious!! I’m going to definitely make this! Thanks
Thanks for the great work. What?? There's scammers out there in the fish world. I had no idea...lol
sandwich looks super yummy! I would dominate it for sure :D
Orale! This looks delicious 🤤
Looks so delicious! Will have to try on brioche. 👍💛
Would LOVE to see a buffalo mac & cheese
I almost thought you weren’t going to put olive oil until you got to assembling the sandwich 😂😱
Perfect again! And, duuude, those close-up camera angles...I actually caught myself trying to smell your cooking while watching the video.

"Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men."
(Prov. , ESV)
What a beautiful sandwich I gotta try. Yummy 😛🤤
Looks delicious! I have to try this 😩
Packers Good 31
my budget only allows fake crab is it okay too?
No king crab tho, I just use filament crab stick
Another amazing Video, my mouth is watering just watching I will definitely try this recipe
Thanks for sharing!!!🦀
"The crabbiest patty ever" ... nice, well done sir.
Thank you for this amazing recipe! I actually have never had king crab. I saw it at my local market and didn't know what I'd do with them. Def trying. As a New England girl, I love my seafood. ♥
😋. I'd love to know your fave restaurants in the LA area. Hope to see a vlog on that someday.
He's back
Love you so much ♥️
I love king crab!! This looks delish!
Wonder if this could work with lobster...
Digging ur channel!👍😎
Who would give this a thumbs down? Lol. Looks awesome
4:00 that pause at "bad" made me think you were dissatisfied with your sandwich, but then I heard the "bad to the bone" and laughed
Beautiful food, wow!
I live so far from the sea I have no access to seafood at all. I think I'm gonna do this... with crabsticks. I'm sure it will still be a delicious burger!
i think its better with spaghettini
First, looks tasty!
awesome recipe will do
Treating myself to this on my birthday!
its probably $30 for one sandwich lmao
love when you give Rachel the food to try :)
Can I be your wife lmao
I’ll have six please
Hi handsome I'm new in ur chanal
Goddamn that looks delicious
Luv your vids
Hi Byron, I started posting regularly on my youtube channel 2 months ago. I'm practicing how to be a vlogger and im still thinking about the content of every video. Still new at this. Thanks for inspiring me. I sub to your channel btw.
It must be delicious!!!
you are such an inspiration B
Looks so good 😊
I will eat that Sandwich like it was the last one left in the world!
first?
I don't even like crab but this. Looks. So. Good.
Krabby Patty?
This look soo delicious!
How did you toast the bun?
Wow so yu2
Looks fantastic!
Mr Talbott, please can you stop making me ridiculously hungry, at totally inappropriate times of the day or night??
Yummy, i want it in my tummy !
First
First
Can you do a take on a philly cheese steak sandwich?
Looks delicious!
am i the only one who wonders if that sandwich was the same one he took a bite out of in the intro or no...........
How much is that sandwich, $40 bucks?
Yummmmm
mmmmm looks so yummy! i never knew how huge the whole legs were!
Yum
Nice
I only tried crab once, but this looks so good. The only thing I don't really like is the "butter everywhere" thingy... I see that as the equivalent of filling food with salt/sodium to make them taste "good". :/
Omg this looks amazing! Why don’t Americans pronounce the H in herbs?
Yummy
Yummy 😋🍷🙏
I think that a Chromebook would have been useful in planning out this dish.

lol
Butter and herbs? Did you really make this video. At least add some more flavor, c’mon
Dude I make this kinda shit out to the blue sometimes... nothing special about this lol
Can you do a cooking class series? Like teach us to cook from scratch? Example: basic utensils we should have for people trying to get familiar with cooking; knife skills to practice, etc. Pleaseee!
your presentation and ambiance in these videos makes me so damn relaxed. Wish I could disappear into food heaven
Have you ever thought about going on Master Chef?
Binging with babish anyone??
Should of called this "Basics with Byron"
do more of these please

more in particular, if you can, do a video for explaining how to use ingredients, like what kind of things go together or how to come up with your own recipes by understanding ingredients
Luv both yours and rachel's videos.very relaxing and calming😊
Needed a brush up on these. Thanks man!!
God, I love your videos so much. They're so relaxing, well presented, edited, and has great knowledge. THe time you put into these videos are amazing and just is overall amazing, ugh. The little end of the video where you share your thoughts, and experiences and such are great as well. Just keep it up, love the content
Nice technique 😊
Serious knife skills. Thought u were gonna try the food at the end..😊
This video is simply beautiful.
Thank you!
WONDERFUL video Chef,  I've noticed my knife skills are WOEFULLY rusty, thanks for this, I think you've reignited my learning gene lol.  I do have a question, when u Brunoise a carrot do u use the entire Carrot? I've noticed in other vids they only use the thick half and save the rest for soups, stocks etc, your thoughts?
could you possibly do a carrot soup recipe, or a recipe using the pureed carrots?
Thanks for showing that simple can taste great
your videos are so aesthetically satisfying, it makes me cry.
More basics!!! We will wait for it!
this is just relaxing and useful. Amazing video ❤️
You and Rachel's videos r so relaxing to watch
Thanks for another great video, Byron.
Byron, please make PASSION FOR CARAMEL TART by Deniz Karaca.
How do you deal with cutting onions and tearing up???
So glad I found your channel been a fan now for a month
Thanks for the video. I’m always looking to take a new spin on basic ingredients. 👍🏽❤️😄
You're better off without a beard. )) 
But you're still my favorite chef.  😊
This is amazing, thank you for this
Your videos are so good. Easy to watch, easy to follow, & you're not one of those people just showing off in videos that are impossible to follow.
Thanks.
It's always good to revisit the basics, especially since everyone ends up with a different cooking style! I appreciate your thorough explanations and visual examples of how to perform each task.
I've been watching your videos  like ages ago !... you make cooking easy thank you👍🌹
It would be fabulous if you could  make some gourme pickle quail eggs recepi.
funny how you guys call those purple colored onions “red onions”. i wonder why, haha
here in Brazil we just call them purple onions.
Love the video and the color is beautiful ❤️
Thanks for showing how to cut onions. Just a quick question, how do you prevent the onions from burning your eyes?
My dream to be is to be a chef. I went to the art institute, was accepted, then I sadly had to turn away because the culinary program was $93,000
Always fun to go back to basics!! Cuttings videos are always great to watch and make.  Perfect audio selection to may i add!
Such a beautiful video with all those vegetable really enjoyed it! #veganstyle
Carrots in my country is very thick but yours are very thin and long kk
Could you do another one of these but where you show to improve presentation? I think there's so many great ways to garnish sauces/other things with a spoon for example that could be really helpful.
Pleasee byron do a steak tartare!!
I would Definitely love a video on temperature cooking. I burn or overcook a lot of food. Trying to get better. More basics too please
Looks very helpful!
remaiNING not remainDING. Learn english damnit

When I’m about to cut red onions for creamy cilantro chicken 💪🏻 #score
Just curious, is this a vegetarian cooking show. Interesting, oohrah!
Love these. Do more
osm❤
Love you ♥️
a true virgo
This makes me wet, also good food.
Nice beard. :)
three words....Ruffled Milk Pie
Be my husband
He look like he aged 10 years out of nowhere
Saludable receta,se ve buenisima.
Why does everybody insist on doing horizontal slicing on the onion? It's already layered, so you only need to do vertical slices and you're set..
❤️❤️❤️
amazing.
Hey! For your cobbler recipe could I take a fork to the extra blackberry mix and freeze it then use it for jam?
You are Amazing 🥇💯
What is the size for that small saucepan used to hold the purée? Does anyone know?
Love it.  More of these!
Just the basics
love that
What a copy of basics with babish! Be creative dude
What are you supposed to use the onions for?
mooore 😍😍😍😍😍
Id love a video on how to properly cook prime rib roast
Hi! Could you please share what music you used as the background for this video? Thanks!
I wanna eat all of the carrots 🥕
When will you have HowtoBasic on?
was ist mit deinem neuen Format geworden
bad
Is it safe to sharpen a knife over a food prep area? When I sharpen my knives, tiny bits of metal come off.
What herbs did you use for the carrots?
Wait did he really have a black screen playing for more than 2 minutes just to make his video reach the 10 minute mark
Looks delicious
What types of knives are those. They look like the cut very well especially on the onions
Omg that beard 😍😍
New fan here, Love the Back to basics! Thanks for sharing.  👍 💛
Copycat 😂
Nnot sure if i like the beard but great video as always <3
This was great! The Art Institute is the perfect partner for you.
Just what I needed. Thank you so much!!
Someone's trying to rip off Binging with Babish...
I’m digging the mountain man beard ;)
the videography is super on point
Nice 2 minute black screen 

Desperate to reach past that 10 min mark
Hey Byron! Tip for when doing the horizontal cuts on the onion: If you face the end of the onion towards you, you can use a quick slicing motion to make the cuts instead of a sawing motion. Speeds things up there, but also means you don't have to turn the onion twice, only once, as it's setup already after the horizontal cuts for the vertical cuts. The slicing motion only needs a tiny bit of pressure on the top, usually a finger or thumb and finger, keeping  your other fingers out of the way, also makes it safer. Cheers!
Why is there a 2 minute black screen at the end of the video tho???
The guy left black screen for 2 minutes to get monetized
add dried chervil to the pureè please it makes it soooooooo much better chef to chef it pained me to see it without the dired pure but still love your content bro
gourmet hot pockets
My favourite part is when you set and eat what you cook ... i can feel the taste. .. now I'm hungry 😅
Byron used store bought raviolis! Love it!!!! Lol finally some shortcuts. I won't lie I thought you were gonna make them from scratch.   (Glad you didn't) Nice video sir ~Chris
“Ravioli ravioli give me the formioli”
These look divine! I miss Rachel as the taste tester;)
This looks absolutely amazing! Yum love that cutting board it is so big!
But how did you use a Chromebook for this recipe?
pizza rolls?
The St. Louis, MO secret is spreading out to other places! Although we use a seasoned beef filling for them. I'm glad to see you're giving them some love on your channel!
OH LAAAWWWWDDD LOOKS SO GOOD!!!! I gotta try this one out for sure, thanks for sharing us Byron!!!
Totally loved your recepie Byron!
I adore the kitchen you've got and the herb garden as well...
HAIL CORPORATE!!! At least it was subtle this time, and it actually fit
What’s the best way to get rid of or repurpose used cooking oil?
ravioli. ravioli. love this recipeoli 😭😭
I am green with envy with how large your cutting board is. I always run out of room on mine when I'm cooking :(
Tomato sauce/jam looks delicious. Nicely done!
Hi Byron! What's your preferred way to clean/sanitize your wooden cutting boards? I've heard of salt marinating them overnight, etc., but am curious what you prefer!
Hi Byron....
Very crispy these little things, so good. The tomato jam looks also gorgeous. 
I love ravioli from Buitoni, because the filling inside is always different.
☺
Oh damn it was a commercial
Glad I found a channel like yours....its inspiring, full of great ideas, flavor, color and everything else. Love it. Keep it up buddy.
Is this a meal or a snack? lol
I used to work at Olive Garden in college and was craving their version just yesterday - definitely will be using your version instead of going there. The tomato jam sounds awesome!
OO MM GG!!!this looks beyond amazing!!!nothing you can't come up with Chef ,always is a delicacy 😋
I love that crunch! Not only do they look perfect, they also sound great!
I can't eat tomatoes, they trigger my atopic dermatitis. So I made this jam with roasted red bell peppers and OH MY SWEET LORD.. Perfection 🤗🤗🙏❤️❤️❤️
This video opened so much doors for where to go to with  pasta!! 
I did not even think about the wedding of pasta and panko.....this must be absolute heaven!!!
Thank you for this very inspiring video!
Simple but awesome dish
Your collabs with others are flawless. The #beautycommunity could learn a thing or two from you ☕️
I always enjoy the simplicity of your recipe even though they might seem complex but It's not. 
Please include eastern recipes on your channel.
Nunca se me hubiese ocurrido freir los ravioli; que buena idea!
My cousins was watching this guy then I remembered the voice then I checked his old episodes then I remembered me watching is bacon pancakes video
Looks outstanding! Always love your video’s.
That crunch!
Oh my god, I want this so bad!
Tomatoe jam sounds very similar to "toe jam". Coincidence? I think not.
Man we have a completely different video style however we are super inspired by your level of cooking!! Amazing stuff man keep these up!!!!
Beautiful recipe! I had it for dinner and i have to say that tomato jam is really divine. Just like you said I guess :3
ravioli ravioli what's in the pocketoli
Has this dude ever worked in a real kitchen or is he just a Youtube "Chef"
Kind of the equivalent to  "I wasn't good enough to become a police man so I'll become a Security Guard instead!"
so hungry i will make anything fast to eat NOW!!!!
I liked how you choped up the shallots. I hope you can make a course on Skillshare to share your experince. Thanks!
It would be awesome to see one or two dinner date(as in fancy) pasta plates from you. Top job!
My favourite part was where he said "Buitoni".
Anyone else find it satisfying watching him chop onions and garlics perfectly?
Mmmmmmm... I have my own ideas but I would definitely use the recipe for the roasted 🍅 tomato jam.
This looks DELICIOUS 😭❤️❤️
Happy Birthday Byron.
I love Buitoni Tortellini😂
You’re the best chefs in the world ❤️😍
This looks so delicious! Gonna try to make it this weekend
do you ever look at the mirror and think damn im perfect? bc um like...you are
How about making another St. Louis original: St. Paul sandwiches?
Could you use daikon instead of the shallots because my boyfriend isn't like onions
love it ,it's looks delicious👍💖
really love your recipes
This never showed up in my subscribed videos 😡
Yay! you used prepared food as an ingredient. Def going to try this!
i can taste it through the screen!
Might want to switch brands since buitoni belongs to Nestle
WHAT BRAND OF RAVIOLI DID YOU USE?
Life hack: move to st Louis theres t-ravs everywhere
I would love to see you do a Beef Wellington!
I'm wondering the culinary def of jam/salsa/marinara? I see different explanations on different channels. Channels just as popular as yours. What's the correct answer?
Made these tonight. The tomato jam is to die for. Totally better than dipping in marinara. Thank you for the recipe!
Are those raviolis from freezer?
What is the chill background music?
Byron Talbott Вы мой кумир! )))
A trick I learned from a chef, rather than de-seeding the tomatoes before cooking, you can also cook the tomatoes, even with the skin if you want, and when it's cooked press it through a fine mesh strainer to get it super smooth and get any big bit outside of the sauce. You'll probably get a bit more sauce and flavor this way
I'm Italian. I'll probably lose my citizenship, and all of my family members will repudiate me, but I would 100% taste this. It looks soooo legit, we usually boil them, never seen fried ravioli before!
Bro Totino's Pizza Rolls lmmfffaaaoooo
Why do you add milk to your egg? Does it thin out your mixture for better breading? Looks fantastic as usual.
Byron is a food god.
this looks SO delicious!!!! holy crap i can't wait to have this on my channel. for sure gonna give it a go.
Am I the only one wondering how these qualify as toasted?
Can you please explain why did you put the basil in the tomato sauce that early ? Doesn't everybody says that fresh herbs should be put at last ?
That’s some fancy ketchup
Ravioli ravioli give me the formuoli
Bruh, please don’t tell me you sold out to Nestle for a quick buck. You are WAY to good for that. That brand is bland at best, fresh made ravioli set in the fridge for awhile will hold up just fine. You belong in a Michelin star restaurant not doing a commercial for processed food.
Delicious!!
I made them!   Delicious!!   I added thyme and rosemary.   Yum.
Looks delicious!
Looks like you are eating epic pizza rolls.
I stopped watching the video when I saw those premade ravioli!!! That is PURE advertising!!! Who wants to eat those NON homemade ravioli. I have seen you cook extraordinarily fine. I had not expected this from such a good Chef, or should I from now on write it in lower case?
Love Love the tomato Jam
If I wanted to bake these instead of frying them would that be possible ? Or would they not crisp up as much ?
Where do you get your music? I love it!
These look and sound so good!
I'm disappointed in you using store-bought ravioli. I was hoping you'd show us how to make our own.
Next time I want to be there 😍
Looks good, but that's frying, not toasting. That shouldn't be called "toasted ravioli".
That looks soo delicious
I saw this on my Insta and had to come straight over. I bet my kid would love these. Thanks again Byron
Doing this for the kids, thanks !!
That crunch
Beautiful.
amazing!
I will make this since you mentioned this is good for large parties which I think this will be a great dish than a boring pasta with sauces.
I definitely have to try to create this recipe.😋😁Random question.........What happened to The Shack?
It looks delicious
I hate it when you scrape your knife like at 1:27. It's a good way to roll your blade.
"Video requests"? "Things you wanna see on my channel"? Well, since you bring it up... I'd like sources for the background music you use, 'cause it's pleasant, and I'd like to listen to it more...
My mouth is watering so bad.
That looks quite delicious; like a fun thing to eat.
Rich mans Totinos
Love it
looks yummmmmmmy
great recipe!! one of your best, but so simple...... I would love to see you take a crack at SUSHI!!! i bet you would do well... i, with just a few lessons, was able to get started and did pretty decent and I already had years of chef experience... as long as you have a bamboo rolling mat, a great knife, some Nori, a good sticky rice recipe, and some good fish, and sushi veggies, maybe some sauce.. i would love to see you do a classic sushi set and then another video of you putting your own Byron twist on sushi!.. maki rolls and Nigiri.. :)
You are so amazing in the kitchen!! Your recipes ALL look so good!! If you wanted to make these ahead...could you fry them and hold them on the sheet pan, then put the sheet pan in the oven just prior to serving? Not sure if they would get greasy or lose their crispness in the holding process? Thanks for SO much inspiration!!! 😊
I love all the people hating on the store bought raviolis. Everyone takes short cuts now and then. Plus, the video helps those who would never make them from scratch, to still enjoy them fried. Damn people.
Those look so good. Can I use red wine vinegar in the tomato jam? Apples do not agree with me.
What's actually in Ravioli?
Other than help you peel the tomatoes, what does grilling them do?
Wow, i've never thought about running the panko through a food processor. Such a simple step, but so smart!!!
Looks delicious
I just subbed and I am so happy to see a guy cooking delicious food, it may sound weird but most cooking channels are female so seeing a good male cooking channel on youtube makes me so happy you guys are so rare!, I am so eager to learn as much as I can from this channel, great content:)!
That’s not an all clad pan. The rivets are missing. Is that a Demeyere? Or a special pan from All Clad?
Why aren’t you on the Food Channel? Great video👏🏼💕👏🏼💕👏🏼
“Panic breadcrumbs” 😳 gulps
why do you talk like a pretentious art major
Panko not Panic  bread crumbs
cant wait to see this on Buzzfeed's Tasty lol
I love that you and your wife create videos that not only contain creative content but the videos themselves (camerawork, editing) are so visually appealing! Beautiful. #5yeargoal ? 😁
ITS A WATERMELOAN INSIDE A WATERMELOAN
I love how youre so calm and careful when you cook or bake, it is just very peaceful to watch you.
in the UK the warm summer days are gone 😭 but then again I’m the kinda person to eat ice cream on a snowy or rainy day lol
This isn't going to work for me
I'm going to eat them the second I cut them, who can resist the urge :(
bruuhhh just when I thought this channel cannot get any better
You could also call this "Watermelon ice cream sandwich" :)
Omg how do you pick such a perfect watermelon 😍
Been ready and excited for this video since you posted about it on Instagram! Thanks for the video Byron, incredible quality as always!
Refreshing, this looks so delicious
This dessert is served at Dominique Ansel Kitchen in NYC...!
this is so cool! i feel like usually you would see a watermelon sorbet or sherbet so seeing ice cream is awesome
Yes!!! 🤗 been seeing this everywhere!
They have a famous French desserts shop in Japan that serves exactly this!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!! I tried this recipe out and everybody loved it :))!!!
This is SUCH a beautiful video! And I want to eat everything you create on your channel!!! ❤
Byron also did a video awhile back about making sorbet.  Watermelon sorbet would probably be really good.
Omg I forgot about your channel! 3 years ago I would sit in my computer class and just watch your videos. Those were fun times. Glad I found your channel again. <3
Thank you for posting this when summer is about to be over 😂😂
This is brilliant!!! You are amazing 🤗🤗🤗
This looks so delicious for a summer day. I wish someone would make it for me! 😋
How would you store these if you wanted to save them for later? Nevermind...description box! 💡
would reducing sugar by half or at all effect the recipe?
Did you use the chromebook for this one? Amazingg!
Hi. Can I skip the churning process and directly stick it in the freezer?
This was beautiful... I gotta try this😊❤️
Do you think Orange Blossum water would work instead of Rose Water?  Always love your ice cream recipes, cheers
Love your channel 🍉❤️
I’ve been wanting to learn how to make this ever since I learned about it!
Okay, I need this now!!!! 💞
Absolutely brilliant idea, LIKED
My two favorite things, thank you!
Looks so good!! Thanks for sharing 😋
You look like a 6ft stay at home dad who works as a Uber driver but I see them chef in you
Can you do his with pineapple?
Oh good your back I haven't seen you in videos lately . Thanks
Have you ever tried to make kiwi ice cream? Love to have a good receipt for that!! Love your vids!
日本～いますか～？
I think this is inspired by that Japanese bakery place that starts with Dominican?
Too healthy 🙅🏽‍♀️
Wow this is such a lovely recipe idea!
THAT LOOKS INCREDIBLE.
It is probably very delicious, but I can't imagine watermelon pairing well with anything creamy, it just sounds unnatural to me :D
of course he uploads this at the end of summer... thanks dude... so fucking helpful...
the best thing ive ever seen 😍😍
perfect for my black friends
Just beautiful
So refreshing!!natural sweetness!!so much respect,appreciate all you do,never thought to put it into fresh Mellon...can't wait to make this
cant i just blend it in a vitamix before adding it to the sauce pan?
this looks so good 😍😩
Thanks for sharing looks delicious can't wait to try it just gotta get an ice cream maker!!!
I have that exact rose water, really want to try this now!
Very easy thank you for the recipe
Watermelon icecream inside a watermelon... mind blown 🤯
Byron i know you use your kitchen aid but have you ever used an icecream maker? Like the ones they sell?
Great recipe Byron!
The watermelon was perfectly sweet! It’s soooo bright red! It’s best when that color!
Say Wow!
Since Ive seen the video of that restaurant who serves this Ive wanted it sooo badly!
I swear he got this from qtang asmr.....
Kinda reminds me of a gelato
0:44...he knows 😎😎
this is so clever! a fruity ice cream sandwich...yummmm
you are amazing
Where do you find rose water?!
😱😱😱😱 your teeth..... you just bit into the ice cream!!! How??? 🤤🤤🤤
ur water melon slive looks dry on the edge, that's because u cut it too early and didn't cover it properly
Looks amazing !
What is a mixing device?
genius
It would be nice if you provide an option instead of the ice cream machine. Thank u
I like😍
Quang Tran did this also, but with lime ice cream! So yummy!
wow i've never seen a watermelon which such little rind ! looks so juicy
Very cool. I'm making these soon.
2nd to last
I must try this 🙂
oh damn he cute
How long can you store these in the freezer? :)
Greetings from Kenya👍🍉🍉
Looks delicious. But isn’t it a little late to be posting such a summery treat
yo I'm skoooooooook i didnt even know watermelon could be a flavor of ice cream
Yum!
So yummy!)
Great video! Thanks so much!
I love your videos!
Was this inspired by Dominique Ansel?
oh my god those things look out of this world! I bet they are sooo good during the summer. And watermelon is always so freshing too :)
Add chocolate shaped seeds and it's like Dominique Ansel's
3:25 Rose Water...
Has anyone here actually tried this stuff and can mention what the flavor profile is like? I've only seen these is stores carrying Indian/SE Asian food products.
So beautiful
🤤
Do you watch simon and martina?
Did you give credit?
can u cook a chocolate sphere ball with mousse inside??
not even 30 second in and my mouth is watering... it doesnt help that tacos are cooking in the kitchen
What type of sorcerey bruh
That's one hella good watermelon
Very Creative Love it
please Byron make recipes from the depression era:
WAR CAKE,  TOMATO CAKE,  SOTHERN HOE CAKE,   CRAZY CHOCOLATE CAKE without butter, milk, or eggs,  NAVY BEAN PIE,   POUNDING CHOMEUR,  SUGAR CREAM PIE,  POTATO CANDY,  GRANDMA PRUIT'S VINEGAR PIE.
I don't have ice cream maker machine, can i use handmixer to churn the ice cream?
I must try.
Too creative love it byron
Awesome! 😍
Just curious, can you make this without the rose water? Does it add anything to the ice cream other than flavoring? Thank you!
Bruh who tf cuts watermelon from the ends rather than the middle
Is no one gonna comment on how perfect his watermelon is? There is hardly any green shell and the inside is really red and ripe😮
What should I do if I don't have ice cream machine?
👍👍👍👍👍
I want it so bad
can I make this without the ice cream machine?😔
You bit the ice cream... how could you do that to yourself
You are so hot!! <3
I sure do need this ice cream in my life.. :)
This looks DELISH! But could you PLEASE PLEASE upload a video of the dish you made that you posted on Instagram? poached eggs, avocado, and what I think is a balsamic glaze?
Now who in the world put this delicious looking video in my news feed. 😡
OK how is this watermelon not dripping juice everywhere?! I've never been able to cut a watermelon without making the kitchen look like a flood rolled over it!!
I love it in my mouth hole
Couldn't do this because I ended up eating too much of the watermelon when I cut it open.
What's that syrup called and How much time should I put the Mixture in freezer??
Reducing the watermelon to a syrup is GENIUS I can't believe no one has thought of this before! Watermelon is like one of the hardest fruits to tun into other things... and I'm not sure why but as for florals I'm thinking a peppery nasturtium or marigold might also pair well with this?
Can you purée the watermelon in a blender and then cook it with the sugar
ITS WATERMELONE INSIDE A WATERMELONE!!!!!
can i juice the watermelon with a juicer instead?
I couldn't bite into ice cream. If my teeth were to touch something cold I'd probably die.
This looks soooo good 😋🍉🍦
🍉 🍦
It's a blatant rip off of a recipe by Dominique Ansel. This channel is derivative, dull and unoriginal. It's basically a couple with too much money and time on their hands pandering to dullards who don't know much about food or cooking but for some reason seem to think they do.
Those who dislike are white, we homies gotta stick together
That's a different one❤❤love all ur videos😍from Kerala
First
You looks like someone that work at the groceries store in  a fruit section whose gonna get eyed by housewife and middle age women
GMO watermelon without seeds? no thank you
You kinda STOLE the idea from Emma's Goodies didn't you? She came up with pipeable soft serve ice cream first. You should credit her!
All these comments about the chrome book bother me. He has to make money some how y’all. Don’t blame the man for getting a sponsor. Wonderful video. Love watching your videos 💕
Has The Food Network seen you? Beautiful presentation! 😋 yum
I really appreciate how good your videos are
Wow!! Looks delish! 
Gotta request for ya...how’s about some Byron Talbot take on guac?? Would love some different ideas!! Thanks for all your hard work! Lots of love from New York...
good video;  glad you have a sponsor, but it takes away from your creative self; strange;  thanks Bryon; jeff
I would like mine without the raw eggyolk :]
I just watched Rachel’s video, you guys must make an amazing home! I’m currently eating instant oatmeal and wondering if I’ll ever be able to make this, haha
Do you think that a Chrombook might have been useful in preparing these dishes?
Just found your channel TODAY just in time for these two beautiful dishes, BRAVO! new subscriber now.
Awesome video Byron!  Thanks for sharing your process with us.  I never knew it too so much planning!  Watchin that Tuna Tartare come to life was amazing!
love the simplicity of the Tuna Tartare just fresh flavors coming through
U made me hungry and i dont really like raw fish that much.
Byron  Tuna Tartare  perfect recipes Thanks for sharing :)
Your presentation is always so beautiful! You seem like an awesome chef who pays great attention to detail! :)
Good job keep it up
so is this like raw ominivore vs a raw vegan lol
How come you dont have over 10 million subs? 
you are great!
oh man i love sea food! both of these things look delish. Awesome work man. Keep it up!
DESIGNED AND EDITED FOOD ON CHROMEBOOK
THEN, MAKE IT TASTY
YUM!!
Hi Byron, oh I love tuna and lox. Yours look so gorgeous. ..mmmhh.☺
Excellent content. this is why I'm subscribed.
Looks good though it's not a bagel, it's just in the shape of a torus.
Both look and sound amazing! Can you do a ceviche recipe?
I am glad you are using the ottogi sesame oil :3! Its da best (Y)
I am a long time follower and a huge fan. I try your recipes all the time. Love the salmon. I would really like to see a recipe with white fish or shrimp ceviche. You put a great spin on everything
Hi great job man. What you use the app for drawing? i think  start the time 0:20 - 1:08
Looks delish byron!! Such a great breakfast. I feel alot of people don't try it or afraid for some reason.
I think this has got to be one my favorite video so far and I've been watching for at least a few years! (5 maybe?) I love watching finer food be prepared and especially liked how you showed your creative process, because that's really where the talent of cooking begins.
you rock I really enjoy watching your cooking
Wow only 50k has watched this video people are missing out on this
Nice video! I don't even cook, but I love watching this video 😂
Спасибо за Самсунг, у меня уже 20 лет всё Самсунг)))
Great job on this brother.
You don't need chromeshit to make a good tartar. Looks great though
Goddamn that is some beautiful food. I’m vegan and don’t really have a use for your recipes but I stick around for your beautiful videography and kickass quality videos!
I may try the cure myself. Good stuff.
Why did you put vodka on the salmon?
Have you been in Sweden?
this sounds so delicious :D
This looks so perfect but am I the only one who wouldn't eat the tuna tartare because its 100% raw?
That looks so pretty and something I’d actually eat, minus the raw yolk. I usually make steak tartare for my dad every now and then, it’s simple to make, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, olive oil, black pepper, minced onions and maybe some fresh parsley. But I wouldn’t eat it personally, maybe in a hamburger.
You should go participate in Masterchef!
sudden urge to buy a macbook air
I would love to see your take on ceviche!
Myaw~ love tuna~☆ love fish
Nice recipe and I really like that Chromebook too.
You make me so hungry 😋!
That Chromebook actually looks pretty cool
These look so good omg
This looks so good
How do you forget what you're growing?
Hai byron, can you make video how to make chilli fries
I am a huge fan of that tartare.
Wowwww chromebook
Wooooow,amazing👌😍
I want to try it but I can't have any alcohol in my food !!!!😔
Is the egg yolk raw ?
❤️
first of all my cooking channel is awesome and youd love it! secondly.. the dudes gotta eat. cant hate on his pointless use of the chromebook
your video quality has been going down as you keep taking on unrelated ad money.  Nobody cares about the touchscreen.
Great video😘
Can you cook some gumbo?
♡♡
I couldn’t eat this. Too raw
The most professional food presentation till now. It's just so beautiful to watch. Do you own a restaurant chain ? I would love to visit someday.
Why the splash of vodka?? What does that do to the curing process??
Does anybody know how long the cured salmon lasts after the curing process? Also any advice on storage, thank you!
Looks like catfood ..
Chef here. Chromebook does not help but my recipe book helps. Byron is a sell out. What a shame. Used to like watching his videos..
cuda af
I’ll probably make the bagels.
Is the vodka necessary for the curing process of the salmon or is it more so for flavoring or something else?
What is mirin and where else would you use it??
I have a question. was it just capers on top or they were with some oil/lemon juice?
Gosh this looks good
Can u eat the yolk raw?
HAIL CORPORATE!
Awesome video! Have never tried cured salmon!
What’s a tartar
Which app are using
It is so calming to see this one video. Like it.
😩
Sorry but I would NEVER eat any kind of tartare
Wow
Im sorry but Where do you buy those plates?
My son loves lox, I'll have to try it!
im confused on the egg... is it cooked? if so how???
This is so Samsung advertising!!
How much does that tuna loin weigh?
Love this video! Tuna tartare is a favorite of mine. Do you have advice on how to prepare it safely? I'm uncertain of how to purchase/store/prepare raw fish and fear making my guests sick if I attempt this with just any old raw tuna steak that I find at the supermarket!
IM EARLY!!! 1ST!!!
Raw egg yolk served with raw fish?
Hi Bryan. Beatiful recepies, weel done. I have 2 questions for you ahah. 
1) how did you do thr creme of lime that you have used on the first recepie with tuna ?
2) where have you bought the first plate ??? It's beautiful
Can u eat raw eggs? I think your better off just microwaving the fancy fish.😄
Whatwith the ads.. that's too much
Followed this recipe to a tee. Tasted great but, smelled like a sell out. Next time I make it I’ll use I little less salt and I won’t use my computer to plan it out first.
Our Johnny cakes are different in the Caribbean but this one looks testy.
We have Johnny cakes and breads in my country (Bahamas). Ours isn't corn based though. Its simply all purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, butter and milk.  I have to give yours a try cause it looks good! Great video
Hi Byron, can you pls do a video on your knives? Thanks
When the cutting of the peppers perfectly aligns to the beat 😍
Anyone else here having flashbacks to The Sopranos? 😀
Looks good like always ! 👍🏿
You should try out for master chef
Oh, it looks so good and yummy. 
Is it a kind of Cornbread? I love it.
Bye☺
Breakfast style Johnny Cakes would be great. Or Chili to go with this recipe would be great as well! ✨
Woah, for a second I thought you were gonna make the Caribbean version!
Never heard of it done this way O_o looks delicious.
Wow this is different, Johnny Cakes (yaniqueques) in my country are completely different, they are similar to empanadas but pretty crispy and deep fried,  we also dont use cornmeal and we make a dough not a batter, but this was interesting!!
This looks amazing thanks for sharing. The recipe!
More Food Vlogs Please :)
Couldn't wait to watch!
Really exciting combination of flavours and I LOVE butter! Thanks Byron. Always nice to watch your videos.
Oh, and then there's the great close-ups, smooth music, invitingly calm lighting, and perfect voice-over too. Technically refined!
Shout out from New Mexico! Chilè roasting season has started here so I’ve got another dish to make with them. Thank you!
I love your videos, your process, and when you taste your masterpieces. Please post more often if possible.
Definitely an edge person here. Savory Sweet is my jam!
I've never heard of these before, are they supposed to be savory or sweet?
This looks so good...Already torching the chilies
I just have to point out that your videos are pretty awesome to watch even without the volume. They are sooo relaxing!!
i tried it and a BIG THUMBS UP  to you, my friend 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Did you use the New Mexico Chili or Anaheim Chili?
looks so delish, i wish i could have seen a close-up of the texture
Heeeeeres Johnny Cakes!
looks amazing with the Green Chilies
Shout out New Mexico! That’s so awesome!!
I literally thought about The Outsiders when I read the title
Awwwwwww I need a bite now !!!!!
For those that don’t have time to cook go to Bandera in Corona Del Mar ( Newport Beach Ca) and order their cornbread and thank me later 💕
What's with the hat?, no hate you look great. Just a question I too also have some insecurities about my hairline. As such my hat collection has grown quite a bit in the last year or so.
How does your smoke alarm not go off when using your torch? Mine always does! 😭 😂
I'm slightly bothered by you not spreading that sour cream.
Can you please do a churros recipe
Love your comment about serving it with chili.  I make a mean bison chili and incorporate Guinness and Mexican chocolate.  This would be a perfect compliment to that rich spiciness.  Thank you for the suggestion!
I was browsing through the cooking channels looking for a cooking channel to watch. Looks like I found a good one here. I always wondered what a Johnny Cake was. I heard of them, but never seen one. You got yourself a new subscriber.
I am hungry please sent one for me ❤❤❤
Hello, My Byron I am from Iran. I make wonderful foods. I love you and I can decorate you. I could eat your own hand ❤ ❤ 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌 👌
Make more videos with green chile!
I'm late to the party as usual...  Those small cast iron skillets are so nice, i have one and use it for all kinds of neat ideas!  What a great dish sir! ~Chris
I never thought to put savory stuff on a dish like this :o these look really amazing though!
What part of New Mexico are you from?
This looks amazeballs,,,,,,The possibilities are endless,  My creative side is going crazy right now.
Looks delicious as always
I love your cutting board what is the numbers on it side 30x30 ?
I love your videos and how it’s only for 1/2 people can you please teach us how to make seafood and andouille jambalaya!!!
100% will do this, this week
Very temptation.... with superb marking
Hi Byron, do you use any lighting outside of natural lighting in your videos?
👍❤
Amazing
Yummy 😋😙
Hi, Byron. I am a subscriber and I love your channel, but please dump the hat. You're a good looking guy. Let it show. My other thing is where can I get that little fry pan?!! I love it!
Wont be long until the streets smell like roasted chile here. BTW if you're using NM green chile, you spell it chile, not chili.
This sounds so delicious!! I’ll eat anything with corn in it 🤤🤤😋 would love to make this for my channel!
where i'm this is not a johnny cake, Johnny cakes is the are pancake like
Very nice. I m going to make this cake. At 3:42 you are saying 83 to 75 degree. What scale do you use, Kelvin or Celcius?
What is the size of that cast iron skillet? It looks like a perfect serving dish, and I’d like to pick it up for this recipe.
I didn't know that Byron has mexican roots 😊
Make a cookbook!!!
Perfect. I make mine a little thinner and fry them in a skillet like you would a pancake, and then top it with fresh homemade salsa with black beans.
Класс!!!
Whoa wait New Mexican roots ? I knew there was a reason I liked your channel! What part of New Mexico. I’m from Chama but I live in Santa Fe
Anybody get a strange torch flavour?
Using this from the barbeque in L.A? But nice video
My dad makes the best Dominican Johnny cakes. I eat them with beans on top or dipped in sugar, depending on my cravings. It’s made out of a flour based dough though. Still this looks good
Where can I get that honey gadget? Lol I want one.
I’m not American but am fascinated with some of the foods I see done for Thanksgiving.  A lot of it appears to be out of tins eg bean dishes, or just very specific to the American palate such as the one with pumpkin or sweet potato with marshmallow on top.  I’d love to see your take on Thanksgiving foods as I can imagine you would do something to make it clearer to international followers.  Cheers
What's up with the hat?
حلوووووه 👌👌👌احسنت ياشيف 😎
what is the point of him eating and "critiquing" his dish?
He gushes and praises literally everything he cooks.
First :)
This is very interesting. Looks so good. 맛있게 보이네요.^^
Can I use corn oil or margarine? I don't like butter. No allergies I just don't like the taste..
I have been watching your channel since I was 13! I love your videos they’re so relaxing and I’ve learned a lot throughout the years!
Better than KFC😋😍
Got a smaller bowl for that mayo, dawg?
love the background music! if only you had named it
Spectacular
Wish I had some right now! Great job, they look delicious
Dude, you are sexy as hell!
16 people clicked the wrong button by accident..
they look so good... btw make another video with oliver pleasee ❤️❤️
Bryon,  the best part of your video, is watching the  eating, joy of the labor of love.....Colonel Saunders is smiling from the heavens....I especially like your going the extra mile with making the sauce...Making mayonnaise  was fun to watch.....Jeff  I wonder if you ever have tried making a vege mayo?  cheers  and Thanks.
Chicken is pretty good.
Looks so good
Oh my, I just tried your recipe and it was delicious! 🤤🤤🤤😋😋😋👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾😘😘😘
Wow! I’ve honestly NEVER seen someone make fried chicken look so elegant and delicious haha. Amazing job as always sir! Been a big foodie fan for a few years now!👌🏼✨❤️
My least favorite part but you're gonna make me a believer. Thank you for the video
Wow! That chicken 🍗 looks delicious! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😋😋🤤🤤
Omg ! 
I seriously think that you should go to master chef or something cause you make the most delicious , good looking food and you seem to know what you’re doing! 
One of my favorite Chanels for sure ! 
Love your food , ur way of cooking and all your recipes !! 
Keep going 🌹
Thank you for the Yummi Recipe will try it this Weekend🍗🤤
So happy to see a video from you again. I absolutely LOVE fried drumsticks! Tfs. Also do you think you could show some kind of cold seafood pasta salad? I love those during the summer time.
Made this recipe tonight for dinner. Absolutely delicious!
You should probably consider joining like a cooking conpetition or something because you are really good at cooking
I would love to see you beat Bobby Flat
I find that adding a few drops of water helps the mayo to emulsify better since without it mine usually starts to split and become oily
Now I want chicken Lol thanks for the recipe 👍🏻
IDK what looks better the drumsticks or Byrons perfect jawline 🙌
Basic chicken and waffles or an upgraded version(hopefully with no music in the video)
You should totally do a cooking and eating mukbang. I feel like it could be a really fun video to watch
"Im'glad and thank for your great tutorial.I regularly see your tutorials.
It doesn’t sound crispy🤣
Love that you always patiently prepare the herbs. And I have NEVER seen anyone make it rain corn flakes😂. Looks good!
You should cut the leg meat where the ankle is so the inside cooks more evenly. Otherwise you get those tough tendons that aren't nice to eat.
tim tales lol! jk! ok I want some
chicken now! 😩
That some good looking fried chicken, and the recipe is pretty easy to do
LOVE your videos & recipes so much. Could you make stroopwafels next?
You did a great job and thank you for putting the ingredients and measurements in English in the description box
Looks good <3 ..but why did he mix the sauce in such a small bowl? 😂 Could have mixed it in a larger bowl and spooned it into the small one after.
y u no give ur wife first? lol
Byron Talbott great video:) ! That chicken looks delicious:)
He even made his own mayo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 while me? I even burn the pan when trying to   fried something 🤣
Could I use wings for recipe, and if yes, how long when frying, since smaller?
Recipe request: Bread Pudding!! :)
Yum!! Thank you for inspiring goodness!!
yum!! defs wanna try this❤😍
Love it love u 😘😍😗😍😘😙😘😙🤗🤗😘😗😍😙💓💛💓💛💘💘💜🖤💚💖💚💙💕😎💖💚💓💜❤💜
Man this is delicious AF! Byron you're going to ruin my diet, mate.
Can you do a chicken pad Thai recipe! Thx!
That just looks amazing!
looks sooo good... i def. try this out! Thanks Byron
Your videos are so relaxing!
Would you ever do an upscaled, fancy grilled cheese recipe?
Can you do a homemade recipe for polenta .
How much corn flakes do u use, it's not listed :0)
I’ll give it a shot. I’m always worried about undercooked chicken. Thx for the oven trick. 👍
mom always told me that you have to fry things twice so that they stay crispy XD
I actually hate the drumstick part. Everyone I know thinks I’m crazy lol
Why does he always use bowls and things too small to easily mix in :O
My certified southern grandma would be pissed to high heavens at those cornflakes but i'll stand it 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
this is one of the best fried chicken recipes I have seen so far! The fried herbs is an AMAZING idea
Any tips for making sure chicken cooks properly frm inside
Loved your vids. Always
نبي ترجمه ✋
I just started following you and omg!! Your video quality, music choice, and at the end of the video, you eating just makes me love watching you cook and eat. Thanks for the recipe I’m going to try it out
I don't know how to cook but this channel motivates me to start learning 😛
At 4:00 is that salt you sprinkling onto the chicken?
Rachel and Oliver might ate them, m so jealous.
Best thing about making your own fried chicken is how moist (ha that word) and juicy the first bite is haha
Jesus christ someone get this man some bigger bowls
Yep still waiting to see you make biscuit and sausage gravy, chicken look really good and so does that sauce
That looks wonderful! I wanna try that sauce out also.
can't wait to try this😍
Awesome channel Rachel got me here...you both rock as a couple.
You’re so aesthetic !
Delicious!
I love fried chicken but I always over cook mine and it’s hard and dry. I’ve also never seen it deep fried,  just always in a skillet. Looks fantastic!!!
after deep fry how cn i store the oil?
Buttermilk is a gamble
Yum. Easy salmon recipe?
Delicious!
Does this method work for other parts of the chicken as well?
It's RAW. I see blood.
Oh dear that looks delicious!!
Have you ever tried churros??? 🤤🤤
great recipe! .thank you 😋
It gave me anxiety how the dip bowl was too small to mix it lol
Yummy..will try it.ty for sharing😊
Not satisfied one bit
LOVE YOUR COOKING♥️♥️👍🏻💖
Can we get a version of your chicken parmesan? That'd be something I'd want to try.
Gentrified fried chicken 😍
Where's the unedited version so we can see you yell and throw stuff in frustraton like the rest of us lol :)
I made this for dinner tonight! my partner and i thoroughly enjoyed, ty 👍👍👍
I really wish you would credit the background music you use, because it's beautiful and I'm pretty confident you didn't make it, and attribution standards, even in licensed music, stipulate supplying the name of the song and composer, so that it can at least be confirmed it is in fact a licensed song and not stolen.
Do wings!!
Could I do this in airfryer?
Those look amazing!! Can you use any kind of milk? Doesn’t specify in the description.
I would love to see some shrimp cooking videos🙏
That bowl was much to small for that dip :/
Love the Fender shirt
Damn those look sooo good! my mouth is going crazy and needs food in it now lol.
U should be on chopped
Why am I  on Keto? ☹️
Since you added fresh herbs to the flour mixture, does the herbs taste burnt after frying it?
Brother i saw your cooking from Bangladesh, i can't understood your all language. 
If you write down the ingredients name in this video, it was very helpful for us.
Looks amazing!
Looks delicious! 😍
Why do I always have to watch your videos at lunch time when I have nothing to eat??!! This looks amazing!!!!!!!!! I recently ordered an air fryer... will definitely give this a try!
good~😍😚😗
For coeliac suffers which alt flour would you suggest for this recipe ?
For the next video request, I would like to see a South American dish. Consider doing Brazilian dessert or Argentinean dish.
You couldn’t get a bigger bowl to mix the dip?
Byron your chicken look so delicious
Pizza recipes pls
Best fried chicken must be spicy one!!!
You don't have to do all that. Flour, season salt, garlic powder and pepper. Chicken backs and necks are the best.
How long does the Mayo last?
My mouth is watering!
it's overcook
my favorite channel
#7
Well I know what’s on the menu for this weekend!
Looks amazing
I’ve been vegetarian for over 4 years now and I don’t miss anything... except fried chicken 😩
I'm hungryyyy 😭😭😭
How much corn flakes did you use’
This video put me to sleep
Gorgeous
Look at that beautiful color on the drumsticks 🍗  I’m sure it’s delicious 🤤
Mouth watering😋
this looks so gooood
Waw 😍😍
Haaaa, what's up with the rubber gloves, I fiddle my diddle then play with my food too....and no gloves needed. Quit being so germaphobeee. Just have fun and dig in with out the gloves....sheesh ...why you do that?
i doubt anyone cares, but my mum uses roughly blended raw rice as the batter and it's the greatest chicken. (this still looks good too) and i like to drizzle a few drops of balsamic vinegar just because i love balsamic vinegar.
I dont get what the point of him reviewing his own food is. But the cooking part is really entertaining
Delicious 😋
GOOD GOD !!!!🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗😍😍
Nice! :)
love fried chicken :)
Looks delicious👍👍
I want fried chicken so badly
These look really good
Tasty looking drumsticks
Its been a while.
What size are those anchor hawking bowls??
I come here to watch Byron do his kitchen stuff and then eat it 🍗🍗🍗
First
Why season the flour and not the chicken?
Love it!
You're welcome to stop in at my place and I'll fry you up some slap ya momma good chicken. no fresh herbs, no sprinkling of salt from 10 cm above and no cracked black pepper. having said that, looks lovely! <3
Looks delicious!!!
Rico rico
What’s the electric whisk you used to make the mayo? I didn’t see it in your list of equipment.
It ain’t my mama’s, but it ain’t bad.
Yummm! 😛😛
There are two ways that are potentially better, depending on the available equipment. One is to first poach the chicken in aromatic chicken stock and then dredge and fry in higher temperature ie 200C. This also works well with sous vide. The other is to dredge and fry the chicken first in 200C for 2 mins and then transfer to 180C oven to finish. I find that both methods produce lighter, crispier and less greasy chicken that straight up fry as you did. Your dip and flour seasoning though look great, I will give them a try using the methods above. Would be interested to hear if you try them.
Is it just me who is missing what you are rollin gthe drumsticks in? Corn Flakes, Chips? or what?
The drumsticks look great. 🍗♥️. Can you please give a shot for Indian recipes( south Indian maybe)? I would love to see you cook  south Indian food. Please do think about it :)
Gonna do this to some tofu and see what I get.
Yummmmmmmm 😋
🤤💔💔
Thats hot!
I’d love to see your take on Nashville hot fried chicken sandwiches
👍😍😍
Love your vids!! Delicious presentation/videography/creamy background blur!!!....Please get an overhead boom mic or a lapel mic for better audio quality 😬....sorry dude! Looove everything else about your channel! (Promise I’m not trolling or hating) ok...✌🏼👍🏼🙏🏼...peace!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg I’m drooling. Looks sooo good
Yummy! I just made this. Question though. I used a used oil. It turned out oily even after 5 minutes on a strainer and paper towels. Is there a big difference if I used a new oil instead?
Knafe recipe
And they say white people don't season.
I love that mini wisk!!!! Where did you get that? It’s so cute and handy
If you’ve been making fried chicken for a while, you know the easiest way to dredge the chicken is by using a big brown bag and shaking it- it’s so much faster and just as efficient
How not to make fried chicken
can this be done with chicken breast?
For really super-crispy chicken you should add around 1/4 cup corn starch to your seasoned flour. I make big batches of sticks with thighs attached because the wife and I tear through and we like left-overs for work lunch or beach picnics (we live on the Pacific shore). I also do crushed cornflakes for extra crunch and sweetness but I didn't catch you mentioning that in the earlier portion of the video.
Hi
This guy is like if Babish microwaved fish in the breakroom microwave
Awesome
Got a small enough bowl and big enough spoon to mix that sauce? Not exactly making it easy for yourself
Very nice
My kids watched this with me and now we are discussing an afternoon of fried chicken cooking on Sunday. Can’t wait!
Hey Byron, i know you love fried food and recipes with layers of flavor and texture. i would like you to try 'Bread Pakora' - its an indian snack usually had in the rainy season with chai. vegetarian and comes in three ways 1. potato [aloo] stuffed 2. potato stuffed but ketchup and chutney spread on either side and 3. paneer stuffed - paneer is - what is tofu from soy milk, paneer is from milk, i think you get frozen too - its pretty easy to make at home. Bread pakora is served with chutney or ketchup. Hope you give it a try and have your own spin on it .
Jollibee chickenjoy?
Why is it important to season again after frying? I know it’s highly recommended to do so, but isn’t all the prior seasonings supposed to ensure the dish is already properly seasoned?
Fried chicken should stand on it's own without the need for sauce.
Presentation on point!
...although final looks burned and doubt the chicken was cooked
Fried Herbs not Erbs
Okay Brian, so the time when it is actually appropriate, and desireable, to use exxxtra virgin olive oil (mayonnaise)...... You DON'T?!?!?!
i'm diiiiiiiiiiiiiiieng here!
The music on this one is terrible btw.
I’m totallini in love with these!!! Nice job!!!
I don’t know how to cook... I just watch your videos to get hungry
At first I saw the tittle I thought you was gonna make fresh pasta!
I'm Italian and I regularly use Buitoni. Never seen only cheese as a filling for tortellini. And Also, too much olive oil in my opinion. However, very original ideas
despite having just ate, this is making me hungry again lol
Very nice preparation Byron big thumbs Up 👍🏼 👍🏼
Squidward...Tortellini?!
You have the BEST cooking videos! <3
I love Buitoni so much. Thanks for showing the different ways to top it!
I was just going to meal prep pasta for this week and was trying to create a sauce. This is perfect
Stunning visuals Byron!
I've always loved those tortellini glad you were able to partner with them
Hi Byron,
woww these different Tortellini are so gorgeous and yummy. I'm Italian and love Tortellini. Saluti dall' Italia.☺
do you know that ur magic chocolate ball inspired buzzfeed to make one ? i mean that's awesome
Loved this!!!
Yaass, I Love some Pasta.. Looks good Byron.. I have to try these!
Tfs🤗
I thought you were going to make the pasta by hand and not just boil
Thank you for this! Great idea for sauces. 🌺💗
bryon,  I have followed you from the beginning....Your love of food, comes out perfectly with the videos...I love Italy and this tutorial brings me joy....thanks Jeff
You make everything look so beautiful! and very tasty!
Yeah right. HUGE THANKS to Buitoni and Nestle for destroying our world. 
Last video im going to watch from you, since you are supporting nestle.
It look amazing I would to try the spinach one
I like the one with tomato sauce. I think I can replicate that at home. Thanks for sharing this, Byron!
Totally going to try all of these, great video man! :)
This particular brand of packaged tortellini is as bad as it gets for store bought products.  Otherwise you're following your standards for great videos.
Thank you for this! Great video 👌
One of the things that i like about your channel is that i can tell that you know what you're doing. Great work. Keep it up.
My mom regularly buys buitoni pasta and their pesto sauce, and it tastes pretty good!! I like their prosciutto tortellini :)
Great option for a meal prep...Thanks for this mate.
That looks amazing. Do you own a restaurant? I'd totally go there if you do.
Everything looked so good. I like how you made three different choices with the same pasta. I do like this brand as well.
Looks amazing as always great job!!!!
Byron you could add a Little Brown sugar to calm down the acid in the Tomatoes, Thank you for the food idea !
absolutely love your sauces but not Buitoni. does not taste good to me.
Looks so yummy! Thank you for sharing  all these yummy recipes with us.
They all look so good! What cheese did you use in the antipasti salad?
Beautiful! Thank you!
What kind of kooktop do you use? Is it ceramic or induction?:) What would you recommend?
damnit i'm hungry and it's 3am in the morning lol
Love you recipes thanks 😊❤️
Love ur this pasta video. I will try for my guests.
I love this collaboration.
Great recipes! Thanks for sharing. Do you have a cookbook and if not do you plan on having one in the future? :)
I already ate dinner and an evening snack but my mouth is still watering
Yummy more pasta recipes my friend Bon appétit🍷👍Texas
The world changed... Never thought i would see buitoni sponsor a youtube channel
SQUIDWARD TORTELLINI
I support you so much, I’ve been spending hundreds of thousands on talbott teas at my local mall 😍
I want to see you cooking Thai food. 😍
Hello Bryon,
I am huge fan of you and your wife. 
I have a small request, can you do a series or week of Indian  healthy food or your favourite Indian foods.
It will be a pleasure to watch that.
Thanks
Darn it! Now I have to have tortellini for dinner tonight.
Seems a bit forced
So so good!!!you always give💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯✅
Ok — I think I can do some of this!
Come on Byron - you know that tortellini is gross no matter what you add to it :(
I can't wait to make the Pesto tortallini
yum yum yum
All 3 dishes are winner!
That's way too much oil for that pesto.
You're making m so hungry omg
:0 lovin it
All of these looks soo good
Alright.. You got my attention...  Very interesting dish Byron. When are you going back to the barn!?
I don't have sherry vinegar.  Is it okay to leave it out?
Am I the only one that thinks he looks like Kevin Love so much
So simple ! I love it
What blender did you use to make the spinach pesto? I need something just like that.
Guess what I’m making for dinner
Where did you buy your plates?
Ma sha allah
Nice video man!
Not to bash your commercial partner, but I was misled by the title, was hoping to learn how to fold and make the tortellini.
Magic bullet ftw
how do you clean those wooden chopping boards?
I would devour the antipasto one in 3 seconds 😋
Please put in the thumbnail or title if it's an ad...
Love these!
i just got hungry
Delicious 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The three dishes look so yummy!
meh, underwhelming compared to so many of ur other videos :/
Three firsts
😋
This guy is every kid from culinary school when they first hit a kitchen, but as a youtube channel
Could you please show us how to make homemade Aloe Vera juice and make it taste good? Thanks a bunch.
How do American's get the word "UUrbs" out of the English word "HErbs" although we write it the same way ??? It is not something like "sidewalk" and our "footpath" ... this is the same word with the same spelling?
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Wait, there is buitoni stuff in america too? I tought they weren’t so bid to go overseas
Some fresh 'erbs'
lol on censoring magic bullet
For the pesto recipe, what's a good substitute for the cashews?
Yummy!!
What a cook...
They look soooooo delicious!
So cute
Yummy delicious
Yummy 😋
Nice
What sort of cheese did you use for the antipasto?
Didn't those old Magic Bullet commercials advertise it would blend everything in like 4 seconds? lol
⭐️✌🏿️🌟👍🏾✌🏾️👍🏽👏🏽😎👏🏻🙏🏻
Very very nice
I love your channel.  I have made a number of your dishes:  steak and potato stack, chocolate mousse and crispy peanut butter, baumkuchen, macarons (thin mint, salted caramel, pistachio), duck confit, vanilla marshmallows, sugar decorations and the perfect French omelette.  I was watching one of you early Q&A.  Love bed it.  Here are some suggestions/ideas for variety (but I’m not saying you need them).  What about that kitchen tour, showing us how you organize your kitchen?  Are there tips the professional chef could share with the home cook?  What about more “how to”  videos?  I loved the earlier tips, like knife skills, cutting veggies, etc.  I would appreciate mini culinary lessons that help me not only with what to do but why.  I loved your food vlogs.  Did the go to another channel? If you are writing a cookbook, not only will I buy it, but I will gift it to all my foodie friends!  If you are ever in Atlanta for a. Meet and greet, please let me know.  You, sir, are a rock star!!
So basically in this three cheese tortellini video you taught us how to make pretty much everything except the tortellini?
First comment!
Early SQuAD whEre u At/?/?/?//?
Sorry but you can have tortellini with anything other than brooth, the flavor is too frail. Also those arent tortellini
Sellout
I thought you were going to make the tortellini yourself from scratch :(
2 out of 3.. salame and with pasta it's a disgrace.. my gosh!
The “antipasto” tortellini got me to thinking, “Is there any Italian course that wouldn’t benefit from the addition of tortellini–esque (I believe that purists only recognize tortellini as genuine if it’s filled with mortadella) pasta?”

Perhaps a tiramisu tortellini, covered in mascarpone and lady fingers soaked in espresso and vin santo? Or a tortellini spritz, floating in Prosecco and Aperol?
Only complaint i have is that i wish you had shown some of the differences while raw because its when people see the meat initially
After watching this I got really hungry it looks tasty
You and your audio guy need to have a heart to heart.
The steaks have never been higher!! ;) Awesome stuff man!!
Damn it, I was trying to cut back on my beef consumption and now I am craving a steak and tomorrow is my day off. Those where some beautiful steaks nonetheless. :)
IF ONLY we can taste what you’re tasting 🤤 
& of course, we loved this video!
Please do a lamb dish!! Huge fan.. keep up the good work!
Wow long time no see
WWWOOOOOWWWW!! You made those steaks look so amazing!! I’m literally craving a nice steak now!!❤️✨
i saw the thumbnail before seeing the title and thought you were cooking turtles.
I am vegan but I love all your content and my hubby would love this..I would wanna 
sauté mushrooms🤷‍♀️thank you chef your awesome...I love Salmon,fish,shrimp would like to see some of your variations
The much-anticipated sequel to Kramer vs Kramer.
Been thinking of steak and this video pops up 😍. Looks incredible! I remember watching an old video of yours where you made steak with carmelized onions and herb butter & ive made that a ton of times! Hubby and the entire family loves it! Also i have been watching you for yearsss ever since i found your tomato and grilled cheese sandwhich that you made! You have created amazing videos and recipes and the best thing about your channel is at the end of the videos how you tatse and describe the flavours and textures of whatever lovely dish or drink or whatever it is youve made!
But over the years as your channel has grown and you create all these amazing dishes... the haters also increased 😔😔.. and ive noticed youve started uploading alot less.
I know it can be off putting when you put all your love and passion and time into a video to create for us to watch and people say horrid things. Yes people have different tastes and different ways of cooking baking etc but theres no need to word things rudely. Constructive critisim is not always a bad thing its just how you word it and people can get rude and mouthy. Ugh.
But enough about those haters 💁‍♀️.
I love your videos and appreciate the time and passion you put into everything! Thank you for all your videos and helpful tips and recipes!
A steak not on the grill? Atrocious! (Joking) Great video as always my man.
Thanks for the recipes is it possible if u could show how to reverse sear thanks
9 people gave thumbs down because they are eating bologna while he eats steak lol
Just close your eyes and you can actually smell that beautiful ribeye 🥩🤤🤤
When you have loved Rachel Talbott for a long time and never realized hubby had a channel with a millions subs!!! 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ omg!!!
My reaction everytime I see a rare steak: 
 



MOOOOOOOOO!
Please write ingredients under video or on screen
Thanks for egypt
i seriously just got heart burn by watching this video
where are the ingredients bro? they're not in the description box
this looks amazing! could you possibly do a video in the future on reverse searing? thanks!
Choice>prime cheeper and and taste better prime usually taste watery
Kinda wanna eat steak now...
This is a miSTEAK watching when you don't have any food...
omg you made me super hungry after watching this lol Good job!
Your videos are amazing
can barely hear your voice when you are finished cooking, during testing
Great video!!  Always stayed away from pan frying steak, but you make it look easy!!
The steaks look delicious! I love butter and garlic with steak. Mouthwatering👍🏻
More matcha recipes please!
I think steak won
do you have a preferred steak cooking method (pan, pan and finished off in the
 oven, reverse sear)?
Pls do a steak sauce recipe to pair with that steak!!
The audio is a bit low when we got to the taste comparison at the end. Just a heads up.
Volume is a bit low when you sit down to talk, otherwise delicious video.
I made a beef loin medium rare and idk why it's hard to chewwww
Weird..but i love your nails...so clean!!!! Haha
Volume is super low.
Roquefort sauce with either cut would be great!
the audio halfway became softer...
When setting the meat to rest for 5-10 minutes. How do you keep it from going cold? Is foil enough? Yesterday I let it rest for 5-10 minutes without foil and it got cold fast.
Look really nice great video keep it up xx
Daniel, The Cooler Daniel
Steak solo
please do a tutorial on steaks for beginner cooks, like how to achieve rare, medium rare etc
Next Video do them both without the Bone, the Bone adds complex flavors that won't be in the Boneless one.
This dude really cooked a steak using a spoon
Even though you got a nice color on the steak, you started this kind of amaturish... 
Try not to move the steaks when they are searing. Think of Gordon Ramsay yelling "LEAVE IT! LEAVE IT!"
Steel pan to cook 2 steaks, rough. Try using cast iron pan for that.
Honestly, that pan looked kinda crowded but a perfect technique.....is that butter salted or unsalted - does it even matter?
Yay! 😊
ΣΕ ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΟΥΜΕ  ΦΙΛΕ....
Looks good . I really want your sink !
If your steak is 1/2 to 3/4 thick how long to leave it in the pan?
Who edits your videos? The production value is very good.
Owh tq bryon! Now i want a steak n am eating rice while watching lol.thanks i will def use ur recipe to cook steak once am done w moving my hse.thankssss that looooks yummmmmY!
I think they would have come out better via reverse sear. The last shots of the steak definitely showed a bit of a bullseye effect.
Sous vide that Steak! RUINED ;)
awwww man, those look delicious!
My family and friends are eating good tonight !!!
you had me at steak.
Battle of the steaks
Now I want some steak 🥩😂
I'm practicing mind over matter.  Right now I'm on a meal a day diet, and watch your video to make sure I can control myself not to deviate from my diet ... it mentally HURT !
Should have done a blind taste test
Was it for video purpose that's why you're cooking 2 such big steaks on 1 pan?
man I’ve only read a few comments down and already see haters :( keep doing what you do, byron. your cooking is like art and it inspires to many of us!
Great video as always!
So it worth paying more for the prime?
The pepper grinder fell 1:03
Maybe cook them in separate pans so the different flavors (if any) wont get mixed up. Also compare eye vs eye and cap vs cap.
Not sure if you've already done this but mac n cheese would be cool! :p
U need a bigger pan
my favorite part of ur vids is u eating ur dish! :D
Been subbing for years... where's your wife? She used to be in a lot of the video.
I can't hear you
Hey would love too see your take on Surf&turf !
Heyyy Love you sooo much
If you were going to compare them you should have talked more about the differences before cooking, and then not used any rosemary or garlic - just compared the actual taste and texture
I usually cook my steak
the sit down review needs to be three times as loud
may i ask what peppermill you use in this video and what size because its not included on the links you provided. thanks
Love a nice thick juicy steak. Is yours cut or uncut, Byron?
No seasoning for the sides of the steak?
"Add vegetable oil to the pan"..... VEGETABLE OIL???????
Why not CLARIFIED BUTTER!?!?!?
i don't understand the fascination with olive oil or vegetable oils.
He dropped the pepper at 1:01 what a eye lol
Pean peanut butter beer shake
I think steak has won.
i'm hungry now
But aren’t you supposed to not move the steaks until a crust forms? and the intro, why would you put salt after they’re done.. and the color. That’s just horrible. No constant gradient. rare in the middle, medium on the outside, and well done on the edges. Just horrible.
I need a good steak...
Those steaks must have had a hard time if they were claustrophobic :p
Soooooo, which was better?
i came from ysac and critkl and thought this would be funny... didn't think i'd be snap electioning a date night
Do you ever worry about contamination on the cutting board? I've heard of people going so far as using separate cutting boards for meat and veggies.
Where'd u get the steaks? Looks yum as always
you need to get a close shot of when you slice them open!
Are you gonna finish the steaks? If not i will have it!
In my country we cant eat it uncooked from inside it should be cooked well , but thank you for your great recipes
Please vegan chocolate soufflé !!
Cook for one self no issue. Cook for other try not to touch your face or edit it out a health issue for cooks in general
Idk I think I prefer steak
Your Pan is too small.
Cast iron is the way to go
Please write the ingredients please !
why put meat on wooden board??? why waste the juices, why???
Why you crowded the pan and kept moving steaks around when the rule of thumb is to the contrary? Like to hear your thoughts, if you think this rule is wrong. Thx
Looks Good
Looks great but in my opinion steak should not be moved around in the pan while cooking, should sit there and allow the crust to develop. If there is a big bone preventing it from laying flat in a pan a grill is a better option
What do you all think tastes better, a grilled steak or a pan fried steak?
Why do people usually just season one side of the steak? I kinda don't get it. Am I the only one? 😂
Overcrowded pan.
🤤
Thank you!! Pls show your pet!!!!!!! :)
Whoa whoa who is this 🤔🤔🤔 the gay and facial hair make you look way different or idk..
Still handsome as ever though no homo
Do not use trash vegetable oil use avocado or olive oil or nice high quality butter
First
😋
Byron! When it comes to cooking sites your my "Choice"! Great vid, reminds me of your steak and potatoes vid. Loved that one.  Question, i though when you cook steak you don't want to move it much? ~Chris.
Toy should leave the steaks still. The only movement is flipping them.
I went to a restaurant and ordered a medium rare steak, first i got a Well Done and then i got a medium rare. Already that made me think how stressed the chefs are. When i got the steak and ate it, it was all chewy and bland and totally worthless. It was a rump steak. Can someone explain to me how a steak should taste and if i got a bad steak? Because now i dont have the appertizer to eat all the ”yummy” stekas shown on videos.
I bet vegans are the "All lives matter" people too.
"too fatty!?!??!" wtf
I am hungry
Wish you wrote the ingredients down 😬
What kind of pan did you use to cook the steaks?
Great job i really like it
So what did he do with the rest?
Bit tight on space in that pan. Better to use two pans or a larger one otherwise the steaks might braise instead of fry.
⭐️👍🏾✌🏿️✌🏿😎👍🏽🌟👏🏻👏🏽👀🌹🙏🏻
Cooking steaks in all of that oil is gross...no flavor.  Why not use a cast iron?
Yet to "meat" (ha) a butcher that would let you grope his meat to see how much give it has.
You forgot to show how to cook and render down the fat. This is a critical step that most people don't cover in steak videos.
http://adsclicksprofits.com/rotator/132
I will never cook steak again without my sous vide.
why does he keep poking them and moving them? Isn't one supposed to leave them and turn them (it) after some 3 or 4 minutes?
Sorta triggered he used a spoon to handle the steaks and also not a cast iron pan to cook the steaks on
Wow
Pan is a little too crowded, and if you're doing a comparison, cooking them separately is a better control. Anything of lesser quality will gain a unfair advantage, from being in close proximity to a better quality product. In other words, your choice cut will be different from someone who is just cooking a single choice ribeye in a pan.
Delicious
Класс!!!!
im so hungry
Dude u are same  voice  erwan check blog.
he is going to eat both of them. who is he kidding ?
Hey Byron, what are you thoughts on your pan-only method here versus a reverse-sear method?

I've been cooking steaks using the reverse sear method in order to achieve an even medium-rare via oven and then caramelization + butter basting flavor from the pan. It works well, but it's time consuming. Could I accomplish the same quality through high heat pan to sear one side and then using low heat like you did here? I'm always afraid pan-searing won't cook well enough to the center of a thick steak and that by the time the middle cooks, the outside might burn.

Your feedback would be very much appreciated :)
Does this work if you use the same pan? I mean the fat in the fattier cut will rend and flavour the leaner cut giving the leaner cut a flavour boost it would not have got it it has been cooked alone or with a similar steak.
I know a lot of people love a rare or medium steak. But I really don’t like to have that much pink in mines. Maybe the smallest little line of pink. How do I achieve this without burning the steak? Mine seem to always burn before my steak is cooked the way I like it in the middle. Any tips? I tried turning the heat down and just cooking a little longer. But it always turns out darker than I like on the outsides.
I hate people who eat there steak medium
Oh my ... Yummy
Could you explain how to make well done and medium well steaks?
Disgusting
1:11
Poking your steaks around like that won't "caramalize all aspects of the steak," it will just interfere with the caramalization proscess and keep you from getting a full sear
o oh - wedding ring is MIA
Awsome!Great video!👌
Would love to see this same preparation but with chcken breast!
Vegetable Oil ?  NO Way
You Crowded The Pan 
You Moved the steaks while they were searing on each side. 
Uneven cooking damn things are raw in the middle.
With steaks this thick you really ought to do a reverse sear. Pan cooking can cause uneven cooking in the middle vs the outside of the steak.
Wearing hat inside... how rude and useless
Hello i have seen people put the meat in the oven for a few minutes why is this done?
dead channel
dead channel
Watching this at 2am as a college student is just painful, but i still do it
Can you do a video on how you clean and maintain your large cutting board
You need to open up your own restaurant 💕 xOOx
Your cooking videos are so unique because not only are the recipes great but the videography combined with the music is relaxing to watch :)
It would be cool to see a behind the scenes of how you shoot your videos, it seems you have at least 3 different camera angles at once! Do you shoot and edit all by yourself?
The quality of your cinematography is excellent, the food looks delicious, and you have an extremely peaceful way of communicating. You are one of the best food YTs out there Byron :)
A brilliant looking breakfast recipe. Awesome Byron!
raw Zucchini, bleh
Been watching you since early 2015! Love to see how far you’ve come. Love from Florida!! xoxoxo 💗💗💗
Really liked that blackberry thingi, nice way of hiding your booze addiction at breakfast! Just kidding, great video as always!
Your videos really  make me cook my food .
I'm obviously forgetting something but what is the difference between making ricotta and buttermilk? I didn't know ricotta was so simple to make.
#notificationgang love this channel ♥️♥️ but agh Byron during Ramadan really your killing me lol might try these for soohoor though
Ooh I love the twist on the avocado toast! I honestly also didn’t know that it was that simple to make ricotta lol
Nice avacado toast but how are you gonna buy a house now?
Weird. 8 minutes is hard-boiled on my stove. Even overcooked. Get that green surface on the yolk.
Hy byron im form Pakistan im v big fan of u sr .n ur recipes is ammazing love form Pakistan🇵🇰😊
But raw zucchini, why tho...
Sooo tasty, especially the homemade ricotta cheese with blackberry compote!
Those all look amazing😂I wouldn’t be able to chose one if I had to
I'd eat these for breakfast lunch and dinner!
All three look amazing 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
can you do anything with the excess whey from making the ricotta? just wondering. That blackberry ricotta toast looks incredible!!!!!!!
Byron, nice job... New Vid!!! i think the salmon would be my fav.  You need a pellet cleanser inbetween those. Lol ~Chris.
Those oxo container on the back tho 😘
Keep glowing chef 😊✨ love from Sudan 🙋.
Tried the avocado one - great recipe, thank you!!!
Love u!❤ your wife is soo lucky!
💚 Deffinetly trying these on the weekend 👌
"wow"
i say as i double-fist a hot pocket into my food hole
I always love the simplicty in your videos, thanks for introducing great recipes.
Kevin Love, LEBRON NEEDS U
I appreciate your skill and creativity.  Although if I took this much time to make breakfast in the morning I would never make it on time for work.
Love your style! Thank you for another great vid!!
thanks Byron...love your toast combo.  You are natural with bringing home great recipes...My avocado toast needs  a makeover....cheers;  Jeff.....have you made a veggie burger video yet?  just asking... cheers again
Please do a kitchen tour!!! 

Love your videos<3
These are perfect for suhur 😚
Amazing!! Much love from Kuwait ❤️❤️🇰🇼
Awesome, I also like mixing up my breakfast toast options. Don't know which one I want to try first. They all look amazing.
Such great footage and these recipes look divine!!  ❤️
Boozy Blackberry Compote! They all looked delish!
Somehow, even though I’m subscribed to your channel, I didn’t get your videos in my feed for a long time and I didn’t realize until now. So, naturally, I binge watch while my baby was napping! 🤷🏻‍♀️
I am SHOOK! You really just showed us how easy it is to make Ricotta
Thank you for sharing your knowledge and deliciously unique recipes.
ΙΧΘΥΣ? OMG That's Greek!
I really like how you made something so simple into something so gourmet and fancy. Really cool :)
Hi Byron! I always love your recipes. I'm planning on making these breakfast toasts for a brunch party. About how many servings do you estimate these recipes make? Thanks!
Hi Byron! Amazing recipes as always. Can't wait to try out the one with eggs and salmon. One thing: this cheese is not real ricotta, I would say it's more like paneer. But I'm sure it tastes great anyway :)
What a nice Twist on breakfast toast. These look so good. ❤️☺️
Amazing. Just amazing. No excessive talking? Very straightforward and so informative. Shout out to the camera person. The vid was shot beautifully. Give the cameraperson a raise! <3
Starts cooking at 7am, finishes around 11am, then begins cooking lunch.
Great stuff, can't wait to try this! What would you say to adding sugar to the ricotta instead of salt. Would it make the toast with blackberry too sweet?
I’m not really a fan of avocado toast but that looks amazing 😍
Oh Yummo!!!!these looks amazing..thank you for sharing...I haven't made home made ricotta in so long!!it's sooooo good!
recipes are delicious and all that, but daaamn, it is soooo slow
u can easily make these in half the time
OMG, looks amazing!!!
I'm hungry now
An alternative veggie topping for the avocado toast is thinly cut radishes! It would work great with that sauce! Also, togarashi is a nice twist on the red pepper flakes.
WOW! Those all look amazing. I can't wait to try and make all of them!
Still got it, Byron! Awesome sauce!
LOOKS/SOUNDS SOOOOO GOOOOOOD! Can’t wait to try these out 😋
Awesome recipes!! Looks delicious ! I definitely will try it ! Avocado and salmon are my favorite for toast 😋😋thank you for sharing with us
I love raw zucchini 😍😍 I think it goes very well with avocado 🥑 and not to mention healthy , amazing recipes  bro 👍🏼👍🏼
How the heck did I misread "breakfast toast" as "breakfast taco?" /)_- Oh well, toast is still delicious too.
Hi Byron, thank you for this. What can I use instead of brandy in the compote? I don’t drink alcohol
Thats actually cottage chesse. Ricotta would be curdling the whey that is separated from that.
Wow! Just wow! That looks amazing!
WoW! It makes my mouth water just looking at those beautiful toast  🤤
Loved this Byron! Looks sooo yummy. Nuff love from Jamaica! :)
the ricotta one looks so good! I forget how easy it is to make your own...thanks for some new inspired recipes Byron!
My mouth was watering all along :D
This was heaven for me to watch <3
They all three look so delicious Byron😎👍🏼
Looks amazing!!! Congrats! I'm your fan!
i NEED to know what's in every container in the background for some unknown reason
The Trio toast turned out to be a 3 coarse meal! So I think it does work from left to right from our perspective. Right on!

Side note, I think his chopping board is getting larger and larger 😅
I'm not sure how I ever came across you here in Nashville, TN, but I love your videos. They are so calm and relaxing compared to all of those loud crazy, super quick clips. Those give me anxiety. Keep up the good work!
amazing... just simple and elegant
Amazing and so inspiring
Thanks from egypt
Love these ideas. Especially the homemade ricotta! I never knew it could be done so quickly. Going to try it tonight. Thank you :)
Thanks for the ricotta recipe !
"Maximum curdilage"
Lmao that was too funny, but damn i will definately try out that salmon egg toast, all of these look amazing
Perfection 💕💕💕
Your videos are hands down the best.
These look so amazing! I never knew ricotta was that simple to make
God dam I still love your kitchen! ❤️ #goalkitchen
I love your voice and presentation 👏😊
Missed u! These look nice
my heart broke when you smashed those beautifully cooked eggs...
Both you and Rachel always have such well put together videos, not just subject/ content wise but the colors you choose, the lighting and the way things are displayed is always so appealing.. very thoughtful videos!
I am by no means a knowledged kitchen person, but what if we added sugar to the ricotta instead of salt? Would that be any good?
The background of your kitchen gives me so much peace & happiness
that looks oh so good! Where's the coffee?  ;)
Can you make fried lasagna, like Olive Garden 🤔🤔🤔🤗
2:03 that was a mouthful
Hi May  i know what storage brand did u use at the back? Thank you
Nice!  However, by the time I get through all of that, it would be lunch.
Started at breakfast time finished at lunch time, call it lunch toast
The westerners will be quaking for this one
YUM the salmon/egg and ricotta/blackberry!!!!
Put the speed on 0.25x
BYRON high as a kite, cooking to put these munchies away... Lmao
Wow. These toasts are perfect! :)
Ya'll haven't even watched the video before commenting lol
ive never seen raw zuccini just being eaten like that interesting
clean and sharp, Byron
Awesome! I needed this idea for tomorrow’s breakfast! I have some avocado left lol
soft boil is actually 5-7 minutes. that was medium boiled and of couse hard boiled is about 12-15
Is there a non alcoholic alternative to the brandy
Yessss, Lawwwd!!! I have died and ended up in foodie heaven.
Wooooow!! New subscriber :)
i have my next weekend breakfast ideas!!
This is art!
Enjoyable but far too long. You lose your audience.
That blackberry cottage cheese one looks soooo good😩
The toast with eggs is great.... instead of olive oil I added mayo, lemon zest, dill and fresh parsley,little lemon juice , please make more videos about breakfast toast
Thank you! 🌹
All 3 of those look absolutely DELICIOUS!!
I see a bit of Smørrebrød  influence here...xx
can i sub with goat's milk for the ricotta and use the same technique?
These bring me so much idea on breaky! Yum!
All that deliciousness 🤤 I absolutely love cooking and eating lol
Ahh that Avacado and blackberry toast 😋😋😋😋not a big fan of salmon
You can also buy ricotta cheese.
I guess on some level I was AWARE that zucchini could be eaten raw, but I've never seen it done in a recipe before. Neat.
My stomach just snarled at you. I don't know how much longer I can control the beast. Run. Don't look back. You must survive to make more delicious things. My... My sacrifice is worth it.
Looks amaizing,,,!!! I’ll pass on the sweet one. But take the other two in a heartbeat
omg how did you toast the bread like that.. did you use the oven? with olive oil?
Cutting on that stone board is like fingers nails on a chalk board! Holy crap goosebumps!!! Gah the sound!
Wouldn't that Ricotta cheese actually be cottage cheese.
really beautiful!  subbed!
He has the most beautiful kitchen. Goals for sure
You make everything look so easy!! I love ricotta cheese that is why when you were cooking it i was like "that was it?!"
A true masterpiece
Absolutely beautiful. Will definitely be trying out the Avocado-Zucchini one when I get back home! :)
Great vid!  I'll be attempting to make the same or some variation of these dishes.
These look delicious! I love a good toast for a mid morning snack. Lately I do a homemade lime hummus topped wth sliced hard boiled eggs. Sprinkled with cracked pepper and coarse sea salt. Yum!
I'm going to try your ricotta one!!
It's great to prepare if you want to make an impression. First morning with a budding relationship perhaps? Will definitely try this.
Looks sooo good. Really inspires me to cook!
As delicious as this looks, sometimes all I crave is buttered toast haha
I have been watching this one for many times. I will have to make it tomorrow. They look sooo good
Best one yet !!
In Russia we call it cottage cheese, grandmothers cook it with adding Kefir to milk instead of lemon :)
Best COOKING SHOW EVER!!
What an amazing job of art in toast preparation...  I never thought I'd place those two words together.  They all look lovely and delicious.  I'm inspired to up my toast game....my husband would love this, and what a great idea for a brunch with friends.  Thanks Byron...love your content!
Definitely would eat all these for Breakfast, Lunch or Brunch🤤
Awesome love them all thanks learned so much
not sure if you already have a video on this topic, but what kind of equipment do you use? - pans,knives etc?
Who would've thought making ricotta from scratch was so easy!!
They all look amazing!!
I'm glad you start to frown less in your 2018 videos when explaining and tasting the food. Previously you were always frowning at that part of the video as if annoyed and i did not appreciate that one bit. Amazing recipe btw
Brilliant, but I prefer your old classic recipes like the artichoke dip, taco ice cream, mozzarella sticks and cookie cup. ETC! Thanks for the great vid tho :)
how long can you keep the ricotta for?
Herbaceous? 😅
They all look amazing, can’t wait to try them out 😊👌
looveeee ❤❤❤
fffuuuuuuuuccccccckkkkkkkkk y didnt i find u sooner 😢
Byron. SEXY! Please pat yourself on the back. One of your best videos.
Gorgeous kitchen and beautiful toasts! I agree avocado dominates the toast world but it's just so darn good! (I made an avo toast video LOL). Can't wait to make your ricotta toast - was it inspired by Sqirl in LA?
Fantastic choices! I had no idea it was so easy to make ricotta. This looks doable. Thanks Byron!
Now i am really hungry.
inspired by the buzzfeed worth it video on toast?
Awesome😍おいしそう😍
Wowww love the recipes!! Looks yummy all full of flavor! Which temperature did you warm the milk to prepare the ricotta cheese?
Hi, Byron how do you find your recipes? Do you make them all up or do you use cookbooks?
M A X I M U M   C U R D A L A G E
I never knew you can eat raw zucchini
I loved the video, but I thought of something funny! I was thinking all throughout the video, by the time I was done making one of these toasts I would have been decaying and starving hahaha
Very nice.  Love the different techniques featured....since we have plenty of avocado in Santa Barbara, Ca that does get used here a lot.
what! those look so yummy! who knew you can make ricotta that easy! i'm doing those for breakfast in the weekend! <3
wow I need me a man that can cook
I never new that’s how you make ricotta cheese !! Amazing Byron
Only cow milk for ricotta?
If I am to put as much time and effort into breakfast it must be more than a toast with pomp, but these certainly looked great and  something I'd consider at a casual breakfast dinner.
Yummy yummy thank you for the video I love this video ❤️❤️❤️
great combo! Love it
Yum! I want all 3!
If that's ricotta cheese, then what is cottage cheese :|
They all look so good
very beautiful 😍
Not really Ricotta, it's a Paneer. To make Ricotta you need to use the whey, heat it up, and make cheese from that. This is usually done with whey that was created with rennet.
I hate fish but I'd love to try that salmon/egg toast!
respect.
Yum!!
so pretty
This is an awesome twist. Trying the one with berries. Thanks.
This was amazing!!! I've tried all of them and they are delicious! He really seems like a great cook, Husband and Father. I enjoy both watching him and Rachel!!! Such a beautiful calming family. I'm glad. They found eachother they compliment eachother! Awesome toast again
Looks so Delicious I can’t wait to try 😊
Looks good! I would love to see bbq side dishes.
I’m not really a big cashew fan, can we use almonds instead?
I was crying inside when he ate them with a fork and a knife...
1
These all look so amazing! Can’t wait to try them!!
Very fancy bro! 😎👌
Omg marry me
Please in your next video let rachel taste your finish dish. I want her again to be in your channel. Thank you! My eyes also on the ricotta with blackberries toast 😍
Where'd you  get that pot for ants from?
by the time u finish it will be time for dinner
Yum!  🤤
❤
boy if you don't stop eating that toast with a fork I'm gonna loose it
killing me softly...
Do you ever use Pissman's Mustard?
But how do you take egg shells off so perfectly? ):
Cook at my house please
then marry my mom.
There will be Boozey bread in my future 😛😋
Yummy! These look so good!
Iz dat you Kevin Love?
Love ittttt! Ty for the ideas and tips!
Fantastic! Reminds me of tartines that I  am obsessed with. I cannot wait to try making my own ricotta :)
Byron. I’ve made a number of your recipes and it was hands down the BEST. Your chicken salad is out of this world with the anise and asian pears. Can’t wait to try these. Thanks for your great work.
I was thinking about making the blackberry toast but never been a big fan of ricotta. Do you think cream cheese is a viable replacement?
Can you show us some of your favorite cooking tools? Like your favorite cutting knives etc?
Nice board..
Tasty: healthy foods
Great recipe, but are you sure that's ricotta? Because we make cottage cheese using the exact same process...
These look too pretty to eat!!!
Wow realy good!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
who tf makes cheese from scratch for breakfast?
Will try this
You are soooo HOT!! <3
Yum!
I love pop bread
Unless you used that whole milk to make another cheese, and the leftover whey to make the ricotta, it’s not ricotta.
love it!
🤤🤤🤤
What non alcoholic beverage can we substitute for the brandy?
Love it!
Not sure if you'll see this, but can you share the link for those spice storage containers you have in the back?
he looks like archie’s dad in riverdale
Damn. That is one guaranteed to get lucky breakfast.
Salmon! Yes!
Im eating that egg and salmon all day
Ive never seen anyone boil eggs then scramble them lol weird. But interesting
For the cheese the milk must be fresh milk or its okay to buy pasteurized milk from the store ?
That's not ricotta. Ricotta is made from the biproduct of mozzarella production. What you have is basic farmers cheese.
those zoukini cutes are too thick i think you could'v cut them fillet  cuz zoukini raw taste is strong
Please make chocolate torte!!!
Looks good
Wtf is wrong with people and black berries. Hello, they have seeds
Omg looks amazing! I thought these were going to be way more difficult. I have got to get myself to try these.
Love it
😄
I hope my future husband knows how to cook like this... good food is so attractive
How nice it would be to marry a chef.
Can you specify the type of milk you used for the ricotta?
If it weren't for its price, I would eat cured salmon every day... I love it so much
ده دلع
Make some chicken recipies like appetites and side snake
You know what they say... the blacker the berry, the sweeter the compote. I'd spread my eggs all over your baguette and play with your cashews, Byron.
wheres the ricotta ?
Looks delicious! Yummy
Mouth is watering...
This vid inspired me to creat my own avocado toast! lighty butterd toast with a seasoned avocado mix, topped with seared seasoned roma tomato, scrambled egg whites with sauteed asparagus, finished with a pinch of salt and pepper with fresh grated parmesan cheese...  was amazing thanks Byron!
herbacious
Your videos is good, the recipe is awesome, but you don’t seem happy while cooking! You’ve gotta smile more...
Tasty !
Delightful
Wow so delicious
These look so delicious! Sometimes you forget how nice breakfast can be when you get so busy that you literally just grab a few cerereal bars or make a quick egg. Thanks for some cooking inspiration <3
How can cooking an egg be so sexy ?! Enjoyed the video, thanks
what is the trick to cutting an inion gracefully and without shedding a single tear lol
8–11 minutes for eggs will yield hard boiled eggs, not soft/medium boiled. You're looking at chalky yolks with that kind of timing.
wow
Yum
YUM
If i have lactaid can i make lactose free ricotta with it? Would it curdle the same?
Looks yumm
Delicious!
I can't believe you have so many followers when you don't even know how to use a knife get out of the kitchen you clown
I appreicate that you taste the food you make. I don’t like when I watch cooking vids and they don’t taste it.. how am I supposed to know if it’s good?!
Nice
What's the difference between ricotta and Indian paneer? From your video, the process to making ricotta appears to be the same but having tasted both, they're quite different!
Looks delicious.but not the typical breakfast for asian.
Where’d you get this type of toast and what’s it called?
Don't you get cottage cheese when you curdle milk? Or am I grossly mistaken? I did not know Ricotta cheese was so easy to make.
Boil eggg ewww nasty
What can I replace the alcohol with?
Can’t wait to try these! My husband and I are talking about doing brunch at home once a week instead of going out. ALL of your breakfast dishes look amazing! I’m set for a year on off-day brunches! Lol thank you so much! Love you and Rachel’s channels! :)
Um hi....marry me
Is there a substitute for eggs? Don’t eat eggs
Dude why are you cutting your toast, it's pissing me off lol ... Pick it up and bite that mothafucking deliciousness. Especially the ricotta/boozy blackberry
Is there a video where you talk about what brands of kitchen utensils, products, pots/pans, etc. you buy? That would be awesome. :)
Very nice
This video is a complete copy of Sam the Cooking Guy's video of breakfast toast
Video is so long I can't watch it all
I don't get how avocados dominate the toast world. I find avocados to be a flavorless mush.
people do not have time for this during the week
I have never eaten avocado, I have never been to Starbucks and I have never eaten at KFC...am I an outcast now? LOL I don't care...I'd rather make my own meals/drinks and mister Byron Talbott often helps me get inspired for new foods to make!
So original! Can’t wait to to try it all! Is there anything I can use instead of the avocado?
Omg I’m vegan and this makes me absolutely sick to my stomach
Is there a substitute for the brandy? And is the jam still alcoholic after it’s finished cooking?
What disease did the salmon have before it got cured? Also could u make a video on how to toast raccoon??
How you going to make a boba video and not have boba straws tho?
Not to mention turmeric is good for reducing inflammation among other things. 

Side note: boba milk tea must use BOBA STRAW! jk do u.
Kinda odd hearing everyone go crazy over the term "oriental". I did look into it and yea, it does seem to be regarded as an offensive/racist term. However, in Australia it is slapped on packets on shelves, there are Asian stores with "oriental" in the title and I honestly know regular Australian (both Asian and other ethnicities that say it. From how it's used here, the word kinda has the meaning of "elegant/beautiful Asian food".

I'm not arguing and if majority of your viewers are American than for-sure, maybe don't say it anymore but just a random Australian popping by; this is all new and interesting to me
Black teas are fine to boil. Green, white, oolongs, and other teas require temp changes.
Hi Byron, you came off less passionate than usual. Hope all is well. Loved the video. TC
Did you say 5-6 minutes?!? It takes me like 40 minutes to cook and prepare my boba.
Lavender 🙌🏽😍 there should be a lavender week teach ppl how to cook with it more plus love finding new lavender infused recipes
My FAVOURITE Bubble Tea/Boba is Vanilla Milk Tea with Lychee Tapioca Pearls!! I want to be able to make it or something similar at home. Could you please do a tutorial for that?
All kinds of health benefits from the tumeric as well.
I don't usually comment on videos but a lot of these comments are so ridiculous I had to comment. How on earth is "oriental" racist? If he had said Asian supermarket it could have been Indian, Pakistani etc. And for those saying he should refer to Taiwan well pretty much most ORIENTAL markets would have carry out the tapioca balls. P.S. I'm Chinese.
Hi!! How are you doing sooo far?? Mmmmmm.... Matcha flavour taste great!! Its one of my favourites!! That taste sweet and refreshing drink!! Loooks good!! Great drink!! See you anytime!!
I did the matcha tea! It was so good, I swear 😋 Thanks for the recipe Byron 👍🏼
omg .. the fastest I have ever clicked on a video
yay!! (1st comment 2nd like)
Everything in your kitchen is Goals.
Yum I want one if each, please! 😊
Byron,  super video;  I will buy some boba. Your tea presentation was amazing;  I love the 3 distinct different teas....very colorful.....you rocked it; Jeff
Oh yeah! It's summer in my country, so this chilly drinks are deff what I need. Thanks Byron!
I also recommend Jasmine or Earl Grey milk tea. :D
Could you make cruffins next please. Thanks
THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO. Been waiting for a good chef to make a good video on boba tea :D
Will you do a kitchen tour, please please??? I saw a little bit of all the jars lined up along the wall of you counter and I got super curious.
Any Canadians here that call it bubble tea?
Love this, thank you for making these kind of videos I have been supporting you guys for a very long time and it’s very refreshing to see that you stay on trend❤️
This is awesome, thanks for sharing :)
great let me taste this. 
*sips w a spoon, then
*scoops w/o a straw
We have those same glass bowls you put the Tapioca in!
Thank u for this fantastic video, I really enjoyed it because I love tapioca !!
OMG, video that I've been waiting for so longggg
I'm drooling over the matcha one ✨🍵
How long can you store the pearls in the fridge?
I use the same boba you did and I cooked it from a range of 5 to 10 minutes(separate days) and it always floats to the top of my drinks:/
The lavender bubble tea looks lovely! Your recipes and videos are never less than perfect!
You made me crave for some bubble tea now! And, maybe for future videos, you can challenge yourself to do black pearl from scratch! It will be fun! Great content as always!
Loved it ❤ please deliever products to Australia
Hi Byron, you came off less passionate than usual. Hope all is well. Loved the video. TC
That looks awesome, Byron! Will give to a try!
So refreshing 👌🏻
@BryanTalbott

One of the tricks I learned working in a boba shop is to shock the tapioca by washing it with cold water, before letting it soak in a brown sugar syrup. Keeps the pearls nice a chewy.
upload more frequently plssss
Hey Asian American here.. idc if you use the word oriental.. people get too sensitive about anything.
I'd love to see an iced coffee Boba recipe!
there's a brand called nature's charm that makes a sweetened condensed coconut milk that works really well for bubble tea. that is, if you're a fan of coconut anyway. :P
Matcha and lavender look amazing!!
My mom always said bubble tea is good, but I never tried it
Hi hello, I’ve been thinking about this video all day since I’ve seen it yesterday and I am making it this morning for my mama and I 😂 Thankyou!
I love the layering of the tea
I think this is probably the best youtube cooking blogger I've ever seen
i can see that your doing this out of your passion not for fame 
I hope you do continue this thing you love I appreciate all of your videos
i'm trying these for sure :D
Ive Been Watching Your Channel For Years Now.. Since I Was 18ish And Im Currently 24 And A Mama Of 2 Under 3! Yikes! 🤣
You Are One Of The Very First Cooking Channels I Started Watching And Ive Been Hooked Since Then! Ive Tried Quiet A Few Of Your Recipes & Still Use Your Cinnamon Rolls Recipe. 
I Love How Your Channel Has Grown And Changed Over The Years Yet You Still Make The Most Difficult Dishes Look Super Easy! Thank You For Being So Amazing And Creating All This Lovely Content!
Lots Of Love & Admiration For Your Work 💖💖💖
nice flavor combo as well!
Boba? Never heard before. Interesting! I like your video. :)
you’re amazing love u bye
Wait is this basically a advertisement for his wife’s tea company?
Awesome video, im really getting into boba and tea mixes nowadays, thanks for the unique idea with the turmeric!!!!
I see matcha, I click
Not a boba tea without a boba straw, but still great recipe 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Presentation is beautiful!
I think we'd make a great matcha and I'd definitely let you play with my bobas, Byron.
Interesting. I've never heard of it but I like tea
my favorite boba flavor is taro!
Looks very tasty..god bless
you done did it again!!!
Notification squad !!! The lavender sounds divine  !
I love this thank you so much can’t wait to make it especially with Rachel’s teas!!!! I love her latte mixes SO MUCH!!!!
I want to try the lavender one so bad! I love the idea of a mix of floral flavours.
looks great
who else makes they're own tapioca pearls?
Wow. Stop bashing on the guy for saying “oriental” !! I’m SURE he meant no harm. A lot of people are saying it’s outdated and RACIST, that’s crazy cos Asian markets in my area (norcal) actually have Asian markets called “oriental market” but I mean, whatever floats your boat. I’m Asian, took zero offense to Byron saying “oriental”. Seems literally every single thing is an issue now. Is it because he’s not Asian and said it? Idk but people need to chilllll.
Where haavvee you beeeenn? You were missed!
Can you make butterfly pea boba tea
I'll name my dog Boba just so I can say "Boba, fetch!".
Sooo yummy! I'm definitely checking out your wife's shop!
You know, I find it interesting that so many people are ranting about a single word Byron stumbled upon at a single second in his video instead of maybe enjoying him providing us with his recipes for free. And I especially don't understand how people get offended by everything these days.
Yes, he said "oriental", no he wasn't offending anyone, it is a term to refer to things that come from East-Asia. Why do YOU feel the need to accuse random people on the internet of trying to hurt you for no apparent reason? And btw, if something were to have any racist after-taste whatsoever, it would be the term "Asian". People see a Japanese or Chinese person and they're like "yeah dude, Asian". How about the fact that Russia, India and the Middle-East cover the majority of Asia, and I bet you a billion dollars, you'd never call any of those people "Asian" now, would you?
I wouldn't get offended by that either though, my point is, can't we just enjoy ourselves and be cool around each other instead of nitpicking random sh*t and getting TRIGGERED by every f*cking thing that the wind blows by? Nobody was trying to make you feel bad, there's no need to take everything personally. Just grow a pair, for crying out loud.
Looks so Tasty! I'm going to make this!
Perfect for the summer!!
So good 😊 great video 😜
I’m Asian and not bothered that you said oriental at all. I know you meant it as a geological term because it does mean East.
That's too much pearls
Looovvvvveeeee this!!!!
Looks so pretty
Yummy!  Your videos are always the BEST!  Thanks!
Hi, Asian-American here and also a huge fan of your content for years now. Please do not use "oriental" to describe Asian things. It is much more respectful to refer to the store as "Asian", and even better to refer to boba as its origin; Taiwanese. "Oriental" is derogatory and carries a very heavy negative connotation as it was used during WWII. It is just a very old and outdated word. I hope in the future you refrain from using that word. No disrespect here and I'm sure you meant no harm, just a lil heads up for next time. :)
Byron, is it just me or did you change up your YouTube Banner again?  I like it, but can't tell what it is?
My favourite kind of bubble tea is passion fruit green tea and I would love to see your take on that or your take on tropical/exotic fruit-based bubble tea. Also, I love red bean desserts! I would love to see you make any kind of red bean desserts or an artistic take on a traditional red bean dessert :)
As a man who born and live in east asia for 20 yrs, i am now officially announce that you are allowed to use the word : oriental
do fortnite
Lol wait... 'Oriental' is a racist term?? I've always used it and no one has ever corrected me... Or is it because I'm Asian so it's okay for me to use the word???
FINALLY.
Very interesting twist in using turmeric! I have not seen that flavour around here since it’s of Taiwanese origin and we usually just use normal tea blends with maybe fruit twists. 

We have a bubble tea shop here in Ontario, Canada called the Alley, owned locally and they freshly make their tapioca. It literally is the best. So soft and chewy and flavourful. It’s the only time I’d order tapioca in my drinks!
Please call them Asian Market's,Korean Market ect depending on which Asian Market  is.
Oriental market? Are we back in the early 1900s?
Looks really interesting! I will have to try it!
Actual boba making would be cooking boba in black sugar syrup
Looks pretty & tasted good ❤️
I normally just start eating the boba straight after eating honey XD it taste so good like that
lmao this guy said “orential” 0:25 💀💀
Beautiful!
yass RACHEL
Strain boba with ice cold water right after taking out from the heat to retain its bounciness ^^
so good
Hey man, 'oriental' is a dated and pretty racist term. It's much more respectful to use terms like Asian or a more specific term like Taiwanese. Looking forward to more videos
An extra gift would be to see Isaac try foods like these that toddlers would enjoy too.. and to see Rachel pop in and grab a glass ☺️
looks delicious!!!
more boba
I don’t get why people are so triggered on the word “oriental”, I’m a chinese and yet i don’t feel insulted by it. Its just people who have too much free time getting triggered by small things like this
I'm highly interested in purchasing queen greens. How soon will it be back in stock?
We still use oriental here in our country.. davao oriental, negros oriental..
Does the Boba have to be thawed out already or can it be frozen when boiling?
Nice!
Apparently you can find boba at a rug store 😒😒😒
Hold up , why did you drink boba without straws?
Yummm
😋
When I used to drink tea I would actually use the hot water from the Keurig machine that way its already nice and warm without scorching the tea
Say oriental and I’m, asian, okay with it.
Now I want to make my own boba!
What is the calorie count like in something like this?
Byron, just because people are getting upset because you used the word "Oriental" doesn't mean you have to be cautious with your content. You had zero indication of any sort of negative connotation and since you said "Oriental Market" that's even more so. There are plenty of Oriental Markets in America that say "Oriental Market."

Unless you actually use it to hurt others, no one in here should be opening their mouths at all. Don't censor your content just because people lack common sense. 

And to everyone here that's complaining about it. Grow tf up. It's blatantly clear your playing the "that offends me" crap without any credible backing to it.
❤️😍😍😍
bildahomeIt's Hitler who started during WOII putting tatoo-numbers on arm's so he knew who to kill. Everybody in Europe know's this... Where are you from?????
Is boba ok w/o the honey and brown sugar?
Looks so delicious!!! Just a short questions: what is boba? What does it taste like? The texture sounds quite interesting
Delicious
Very good for summer. I’ll add a little bit of apple cider vinegar on turmeric though
I wouldn’t really use brown sugar to sweeten the pearls. Most places (for americans “boba” and chinese “pearls”) have it only with honey. Side note, my mom uses powdered coffee creamer as the “milk” portion in pearl milk tea.
Are u serious??? Love this video thank you so much
Yummy
What's boba?
👍🏼👍🏼
That lavender tea sounds awesome! Yes for more boba recipes!!! Maybe one with the jellies at the bottom or lychee flavored :)
Why is matcha so popular? I feel like it would taste like grass
I wasn't aware that Oriental is derogatory... I certainly don't take offense to it. I'm pretty sure in the UK that use to be or still is the "correct term" for Asians. In Asia a lot of people learn English from the UK and a lot of the older generation say Oriental when referring to themselves. I really don't think it's an issue to say it but I suppose because of the history here in the US it's not okay to a lot of people.
Your title is misleading to me. Boba is the black tapioca pearls. The tea drink with boba is called bubble tea/boba tea, ect...
Ugh ... It isn't an "oriental" market, it is called an "ASIAN" market.
🎶Byron buddy where you’ve been? The term is Asian American🎶 (who gets my reference?)
Where does the name boba come from?  We call this bubble tea, first time I've heard it called boba, yet everyone in the comments gets it!
Looks yummy. I love that you involved Oliver in the kitchen with you
This makes me want to have kids ❤️
I wish my dad taught me how to cook 😔
Edit: forget it, if my dad ever taught me how to cook, I'd be diabetic now 😑
he is so big already 😮 i remember when rachel announced the pregnancy like it was yesterday🙈
Its fun having your lil boy helping to make the granita😄Oliver did a gr8 job👍
Can you do more videos with Oliver? Love watching the two of you!
Aww, the young chef did a wonderful job helping you!

This was the cutest thing! ❤️ I love when parents involve their kids in the kitchen.
Hahaha "do you keep tooting?"😂

I LOVED this video. My 3 year old even intently watched and asked questions the whole time. He was so excited and even said "bye guys see you soon!" I hope to see more kid friendly videos in the future!
Oliver looks just like Rachel. It's incredible
How did you avoid spilling those trays? And how did you have enough room for all of them in your freezer?
I enjoy your channel. Your son adds a nice twist on something I already enjoy.  Thank you for sharing with us.
Unproblematic fathers bonding and having fun with their sons are the best 💚your boy did an awesome job!

5:39 That's basically me, eating the ingredients instead of the final dish

Wow, I had never heard of granita before. But now, after seeing how easy they are to make, I'll have to give them a try. They look really refreshing. Thanks, Byron!!
Please make another meaty recipe soon!
Favorite video Ever!!!

Your son is so cute and patient. I loved this recipe and the way you included your son, totally trying this with my little cousins.
“Do you keep tooting” 😂😂
Oiver is so adorable 😘
Oliver is adorable!
I love this!!
aww oliver looks like rachel
Pomelo is a hybrid of a grapefruit
This is so cute omg
Would most of the fruit not have enough natural sugar for a granita to still be sweet?
So Herzig!
Aww, he's so cute .. .love the recipe. .
Kid is sooo cute. God bless your family 😇😇😇
Hello Oliver ...super cute child.  gd to learn from you...

Proper instruction from a parent to their child imo. More like this plz.
Seeing that lime granita makes me want to drink beer and lime
Love Oliver!

I would love to eat those in the summer! Great Video!
If I asked my nephews to help me they would be bored in few minutes. Your Son looks very keen to learn new things unlike boys his age. He is smart and Adorable!
Great adult level cooking accessible for kids!!
Isnt this 6 ways?
“Do you keep tooting????” - sounds like me to my kids
Hi what brand hand whisk do you use
Please do a lamb dish!! Thanks :)
So cute with you're son :)
Such a cute video ❤️
Loved this video Byron! Easy, classic recipe yet exciting to see it with a child's perspective. He's so incredibly sweet too! Happy summer to you guys. Pomelo and honey granita will be an addition to a dessert I'll make for an upcoming dinner party. Thanks for the inspiration, as always.
Your kid is so cute!
What a fun video! My daughter would love this. I cant wait to try it with her. Thanks!
If you put ice cream on the top it gonna be great
I'd absolutely LOVE to see more with lil man in the kitchen. How old is he? Looks about my little ones age. If you can do it, so can I!! Thanks, Byron, love the vids, even the ones without the lil cutie helpin you!!
So cute! Daddy and son)))
Wholesome :,)
baby and husband fever
This video is soo sweet. I also can't wait to try this out. Once the little one strarted singing I just could go stop smiling. Too cute.
Can’t wait for you to be on the food network. Your like giada- so relaxing to watch and listen to! You both make great food!
Ovo has child safe knives so that the kids can independently cut and help in the kitchen without having to worry! :)
This is way too cute
Pomleo
Looks superb
Can I still make this if I have the heart of a kid?
I would love to do this with my son
Your kid’s adorable!!! It’s good you get them interested into cooking early. I’m getting to the age where I would normally start to lose interest in things like this, but because of videos like these I’m getting more adventurous with my cooking.
So cute!
Very sweet video! Looks yummy
why you smashed the blueberries and then blended them? why can’t we just blend them?
dilf
So is this kinda like a grainy sorbet or a flavoured shaved ice dessert?
Woooow!!! It's cool ;)
Cuteness overload!!!!!!!!!!!
🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉I want the watermelon. It looks so yummy. Watermelon is my fav fruit. 🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
Does anyone on any cooking channel on tv or YouTube ever say “eh, not what I expected” or “I’ve definitely made it better”. Is every single time always just perfect in taste?? Honestly, I’d like to know
so much sugar....so healthy  =)
I'd let you grind on me 5 ways, Byron.
I disliked the video and it dosent stay on the video so im disliking it here be professional  dont bring kids on rip - unsub
subway workers wear hats inside? Lmao why so triggered when byron does it?
wtf I had no idea people get triggered when people wear hats inside. Maybe we don't do our hair everyday??
Do a "hat" series!!! Trigger them allllllllll! 😂😂
Oh and this looks delicious. If only my baby would let me cook. One day... one day....
And then I'll turn this into an ice cream cake.
I would use the waffle chips to dip into the ice cream and eat that ENTIRE bowl.    😍😋
I'd love to see your take on a deep-fried icecream.
It's so relaxing to watch this at night...but it does have the side effect of making me unbelievably hungry T^T
Neapolitan ice cream in my house growing up always was eaten up with the strawberry part left . So our parents had to eat the strawberry ice cream🤣🤣🤣
Coat the crispy waffles with chocolate.
wish I could go 😭 but I'll send all my support to you! Congratulations 😊
I dont like chocolate ice cream but strawberry and vanilla is a winning combination. These look so good! 😍
You should make a collab with Alex French Guy Cooking and make caneles
I'm also named BrYoN but It is acualy Bryan 😊😆😄
Love you Byron 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
You’re a good chef 👨‍🍳
byron!!! pls come to NY <3
I'm definitely going to try to make these during the summer time or when it stops snowing in spring 😂
The ice cream needs to be frozen longer so that it doesn't spill out everywhere. Or the waffle needs to be cooked softer.
Looks delicious😋 😋 😋..keep up the good work and god bless you
His tattoo on his left hand is a Greek word.😉
13th also Byron ur pretty lit
It is natural and delicious! well done 😊
If I lived in the States, I'd so come and indulge into your food! Sadly, your video's will have to do ;). Great job, keep it up!
This is delish yum just too good my family and I luv your family so so much nice .😚🙌👍💕
Strawberry ice cream isn't as good as strawberries themself, so I was wondering what Neapolitan ice cream would taste like with the strawberry ice cream replaced by strawberry sorbet because tbh fruit sorbet is so much better than fruit flavored ice cream
byron can u please make a video of love portion Baskin Robbins ice creme
What a wonderful idea!  Hey since your trying to change things up I would like to see maybe a weekly series of family dinner night where you Rachael and maybe the kids and show dinners that the whole family can help with.  I liked it when Chrysler sponsored you guys for that reason.
Ooh, Demeyere. It's a nice change since we're so used to seeing you cook with All-Clad.
That looks really good!!! My sister would love this!!!💖✨
Another top notch creation Byron!
These look amazing!
Im such a big fan, i literally got into culinary art because i got inspired by your amazing and innovative dishes! thank you so much Byron
Hi Byron can we use a griddle instead of a waffle iron?
That looks delicious 🤤
Neat video .  Thanks
Omg this looks so yummy! LOVE this idea!
Omg I loved it ... and I loved your videos
It's like you're just phoning it in at this point. What's next? Toast?
Hi Byron, Ι see you have a Greek tattoo. Are you from Greece?
more shack vids please
a hot guy making food. What could be better
I want this and I'm like yesss
Gosh that looks amazing
Thanks for being my inspiration, thanks to this YouTube channel, and the kitchen, and the amazing recipes you make.

I'd love your cream in my waffle, Byron.
Delicious .. ♥♥♥ thank you Chef.. ♥
Great recipe!
I always love the vibe of your videos! I really wish I could go to your pop-up, but sadly I don't live in the US ~ I hope you can come by Canada, your neighboring country, in the future!
Wao...its just amazing...
Why are you wearing a hat indoors?
Waffle is my favorite dessert
I need you
Reminds me of the Tillamook Cookie Ice Cream Sandwiches (I think that's what it's called lol)
No lie I made that last night but just waffles and ice cream
Americans need to stop wearing caps indoors lol
I'd love to order those and get them delivered to my address in the USA? is it possible?
Sneaky finger lick at 4.24… don’t blame ya though
PLEASE MAKE BEIGNETS!!!!
Can you try making different types of herb and floral ice creams?
Looks delicious! the base too 😊
Omg this looks so delicious, I'd kill for one of those right now lol
Can I use orange instead of strawberries?
Whats with the hat ?
❤️❤️
De todos los vídeos estos son los mas satisfactorio y rico q e visto en toda mi vida y q creativo eres
Byron that is awesome, the Pop up looks like so much fun.  If you ever come to the east coast i would love to go!  This video reminds me of your homemade ice cream sandwiches.  That vid is one of my fav's of yours.  Very nice job sir. ~Chef Chris Not sure about the hat, honestly think you look better without.  Just my thought...
yum
Looks soooo yummmmy. 😍😍😍
can u stop eating ur fingernails. Grow up!
Yummy
WHITE in the Middle plz 😅
Whats with the hat? Bad hair day?
Looks amazing, but this did not need to be a 10 minute video
Laughed so hard when I saw not 1, but 5 separate pans for crepes
The videography in your videos are always so aesthetically pleasing!
Why is he slicing on the pan?
now I'm hungry(*´﹃`*)





日本人いない😭
How do you cook shrimp/crab/lobster. My husband loves seafood and I can’t stand it so I don’t cook it. But I’d like to surprise him one day. 

That and duck/lamb dish would be nice.
One thing I learned from chef Jacques Pepin when it came to avoiding lumps in crepe batter was to only pour in half of the milk into the dry ingredients and mix it until it looks like regular pancake batter, then add in the rest of the milk. What do you think of this method?
aww you went back to the old filming style! love matcha so much!
😍 looking forward to the ingredients.. I'm ready to try it out today.
Byron why do you have so many identical tiny pans ?!!!
Your recipes always turn out looking stunning in the end!
Omg. I’m drooling... 🤤 this looks amazing! Great video❤️
Thank you Byron!!! So glad you decided to make the Matcha Crepe Cake. This is one of my favorite desserts! Can't wait to try your recipe.
Definitely will give this a try!
Would flambe-ing this with some Grand Marnier be a good idea perhaps?
Looks a bit too sweet for me but loved the video anyway! Might make my own variation on this.
Wow...wish I had a kitchen like that 😍
I have always loved how you construct your cooking videos! I believe you deserve more recognition!
I really love matcha, and I would like to try this soon. Thank you for your hard work! ♥ Keep it going ! :D
Finally a recipe with MATCHA in it!!! Great video!!
Awwww........I love Matcha. This is basically torture😭😭😭😭

And omg.....How many pans do u have?😂😂
Woow!! I really like your Matcha crepe cake recipe so much!! My favourite Matcha flavour!! That taste so fluffy and delicious cake!!! So good to try that!! That looks amazing!! Why don't add red beans on the cream?? Great recipe!! See u anytime!!
Byron, I know somebody said it before, but your cooktop LP is def not right with the air mix. That orange flame means somewhere too much air is getting into your system, either at your tank or at the cooktop, but you need an adjustment cause it wastes LP and you aren't getting the heat you should from that orange flame. Crepes look amazing anyway though!
WHAT!! crepe cake?!?!?!oh my oh my!!love everything about this all all content,background,editing,everything Chef does is just perfection..he should write a cookbook!!looks amazing..I'm sure tastes even better
Beautiful!! Looks amazing. Loove matcha!
I saw another one of these but it looked pretty unsettling but this one looks really nice!!
Thank you so much Byron Talbott! I love matcha, crepes, and cake!
It's alive! Give me Matcha More
What did the leprechaun say to his brother during dinner? 

If you pay half, I'll MATCHA.. 😂
so beautiful👌
I need to make this! Looks so delicious and I love crepes!
Took me 2~3 hours to make with ONE pan, and took me less than 5 minutes to eat it
Holy Damn that looks awesome!!!
Where can I find the recipe? 😕
Haha, I love how you say 'Matcha... it almost tastes green', because it's so true :D No other way to describe the taste of matcha. Love the recipe, I'm a bit intimidated by making custard, but maybe I'll give it a shot sometime.
I've made crepe cakes before but not quite like this, will giver a shot bud, thx.
yum thank you Byron
I love matcha <3
This looks incredible .
Why does a person need like 6 minuscule staub skillets lol
AS INDIANS WOULD say sweet green dosa!!!!! 😂😂😂🤮👌🏽dang they look good
Very interested in trying it. Would the flavor be strong or delicate?
make an Arborio Pudding!
Now I'm hungry
I like how its sliding lol
Your gas burners are starved of oxygen - your generating soot and getting a lower temperature flame.
Mm yes, I love matcha!!
Love the desserts, they're always beautiful and just a joy to watch. :3 Thanks for the video~
Super as ever 💃🏻
"tasting green" is not a good thing in my opinion my dude😂💔

Wowwwwww😍
Oh, for St Patrick's day? Lol
Hmmm...... Japanese Method ?

Matcha tastes like old dried tea to me but you make it look delicious!
Seems difficult to eat out of that mini pan
PLEASE MAKE MORE MACAROONS!?!!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽I’m like your biggest teen fan
You can tell by his face and the way he explains it right away he didn’t like that matcha flavor
this looks so gooooood!! i wish i knew how to cook lol
I subscribed just to see your bitchin kitchen lol
Recipe please!!!
I'd let you crepe me and pour your batcha in between my cakes, Byron.
Looks like Ethan from Sean Cody
Could you make a pizza
What kind of lighting setup do you have for your videos, Bryan?
Have you ever made anything that you end up not liking lol? Guessing you have and just didn't post the video? Just thought about that and thought your reaction at the end would be hilarious.
whats the point of a recipe when there is no RECIPE
What a beautiful man jesus
Is anyone gonna talk about how he has the exact same of 5 pans lol i dont even have 2 pans
Is this for st. Patrick's day?
Yumm ur awesome it looks delicious😍
I love watching your videos.. then I get hungry 😋
Ooh this looks so yummy! i bet it taste as good as it looks! 😍🎆😌
Bomb😍
Anyone know what pan he cooked the crêpes in?
the fire was on the whole time
it looks pretty heavy
where do u buy your matcha?!
I don’t even like Matcha yet I am watching this video . I just love your videos!!!!
Out of all of the cooking channels on YouTube, your comment section seems to be the most critical. Let the man cook dammit
Looks delicious Bryan 😁👍
lots of green going on here
Looks Deeeeeeeelicious!
You can save up in money by using the matcha that's actually used for cooking (lowest quality one) you dont have to use the expensive stuff
You should get Rachel to taste test :)
Hi Byron, have you tried tiramisu matcha pancakes in Socal? I have tried it at a restaurant called Cafe Nouveau? in Ventura, CA, and it's so awesome, can you please post a video on how to make it?!?
G
I love it
Wow delicious
Hey Byron, very interesting!  Do you think you will ever do vlogs again? Like restaurant reviews. Ect??
Sorry wrong spelling of your name
How is he still so thin?
Hi, i'm from Brazil, and would be really nice to see you try to make a dessert call "Bolo de Rolo".
Hi, what is the brand of the matcha powder that you use? And where can I get it?
Yummyyy
where do you buy your matcha? it's difficult to find the balance between quality and quantity and price
Anyone else crying about the fact that he's using a knife on his cast iron? Just me? Okay.
WTF is a "healthy" amount of butter? HOW MUCH BUTTER KEVIN?
It’s been over two months and i barely got the chance to buy matcha powder so I’m excited to try this out!
IM HUNGRY 😭
Soo with all the eggs and milk in the batter, gluten free flour will also hold, riiiight?
did your whisk brake at 1:10 ??
Why stack the crepe on top of each other after cooking them, shouldn't you lay them out separately to let them cool first?
That is one ugly cake. Congrats!
Where do you get your matcha powder? Thank you.
Can i replace milk with almond milk or coconut milk? And for the flour, can I use almond flour? And what's a good substitute for the butter ? Thanks
Delicious
yum
You revisit your recipes like 5 times lol very repetitive
Yuck
wow no thanks -but thanks for the video
