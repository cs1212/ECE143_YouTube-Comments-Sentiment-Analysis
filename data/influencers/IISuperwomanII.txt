How many people in our small village?
10 million..
😂😂
That bargaining thing was the most realistic part.
The moment when ask your self.. There is something missing? 

Then they dance 
😂😂
*As an Indian i can say that the bargain thing is totally legit*, lmao
Almost everything was somewhat relatable. XD
"How many people in our small village?"
"Ten million."
Me: ...
This video is better than Season 8😂😂😂😂😂
'I come here all the time I'm loyal customer'

my last attempt to close the deal. xD
And the best intro ever is,
Danerpreet Tarbachan 👑
Queen of New Delhi 🇮🇳
Master of Dandia 🥁
Protector of cows 🐃
Head of the rail Gaddi 🚊
And
Mother of Peacocks 🦚
🤣🤣🤣
3:41 WAIT where'd you get the third slipper?? Back-up? 😂😂🤣

All I can think about now is that pairless slipper lol
How many people in our small village?
10 million

That's what I call smart writing.
Give him 40 bars of gold. 

Ma'am please.
Hm?
ROFL. The way to bargain in India well, no the whole of South Asia LOL
I haven't watch a single episode of GOT but I laughed so hard...😂
"How many people in our small village?"
" 10 million "
Dead. 😂😂😂🤣
So you missed the perfect opportunity to drink chai instead of wine?😭
"Protector of Cows,"
"Mother of Peacocks,"
"Head of Rail Gudi."

Lol when you took a Cricket bat 😂😂😂😂😂
*" I come here all the time I am loyal customer “

 "How many people in our small village?"
"10 million"
tea sip
That KILLED me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The scene from the Battle of the Bastards. GODDAMN YOU I AM SO CONFLICTED it was hilarious but it still hurts 😂😭😂😭😂
Daenery three therbachan, the protector of cows...

The bargaining part was so real and the slippers one

Malhari was funny at the end (Malhari is a bollywood song from Bajiroa Mastani)
Cersei would have got those elephants she wanted
Hey love you and you should do a types of pet owners video?😍
This is so hilarious! Couldn't stop laughing😂😂
In an Indian GoT, the Night King and his walkers will definitely have a sing and dance session with the collapsed wall as their background
"I come here all the time. I'm a regular customer"😂😂😂 the only dialogue which made Indian markets famous 😂😂😂😂 Love from Bangalore ❤️ Amazing work!!
Also...
JITENDER SNOW😂😂😂😂😂

Someone let the Iron throne watching 

this..
I am so accustomed to Indian movies that the battle scene looked real to me!
that cricket bat killed me😂😂😂
Really good job, you are only missing the dub that is so bad that their mouths and the dubbed voice aren't even move at the same speed.
The ungodly long stares between the characters that happens every time something happens, NO MATTER WHAT!
And the commercial, tha make a 24 minutes mini episode occupying all the space between  10:30-12:00.
😂😂😂 
.
yeah, i learned english to understand you, and i can!
I died when you said anti ji
😂😂😂😂
India loves Cricket 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Hot (dragon) queen : oh Jitender Snow
J Snow : ...Aunty ji
I swear in an indian movie a girl and a boy can literally have orgasms just by huging or touching each other... 😂✌️
OMG BAJIRAO MASTANI DANCE AT THE END WAS GOLD
Lmfao. Seriously lmfao😂🤣😂🤣👏👏👍👍❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️
"Oh gentlemen Snow"

Dude we need a second part
The best part:
"I give you best price! Special Price! 50 gold bars, oen dragon, and five Dothraki."
"Ok. Give him 40 gold."


Literally my dad every where we go.
Lilly no matter how old you get you will forever be 26 in my mind
Better Snow than the original.
Lilly you should do a types of Store Clerks. Huh. It might be worth a try
From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for making this video, it was amazing XD
Just watched F the Prom again. Hilarious movie. It would be cool if you did a collab video with Madelaine Petsch
The bargaining scene is actually spot on. My mom does the same every time😅😅😅. LoL
I died when the chancla came out 🤣🤣🤣 of all the GoT I’ve watched and all the Indian media I’ve seen this is so accurate.
The wine should of been tea😂😂
I love this...anyway like this post and I will subcribe to anyone who does

Bargaining scene was awesome.. reminded me of my mother in local market 😂😂😂
OMG the bargaining scene is right on. 😂

"How many people in our small village?"
"10 million"
AHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
She : Oh Jatinder Snow 
Him: AUNTY Ji 
Holy I'm dead hahaha .. 2:30
Bravo,c'est très très drôle!
I was really looking forward to an hour of dancing.
I lost it when Ramsay picks up slipper
"Oh Jithendar Snow... "
"Auntijeee...."
"The lanisters have one million army.."

"How many people we have in our small village ??"
"Ten million ..."

"Sluurrrpppp...uhhh"☕☕
Bargaining was fireeee🤣🤣🤣
0:09

Superwoman Superwoman where are you 
Being missed being missed by my fans 😞☹️😔😩😩😩😭😭😭
Omg the bargaining part is soooo true and I’m not Indian (I’m middle eastern) but i have enough desi friends to witness it lmao
I found you a man!Anwar jibawi
3:44
Throwing with slipper
😂😂
I honestly loved this and shared it with all my friends 🙌🏼🙌🏼😭♥️♥️😭😂😂
4:50 caught me off-guard so bad 🤣🤣🤣this entire video is beautiful 😂
Ok I watch Indian movies all the time so this was 100% true! The ending KILLED ME!!!😂😂😂😂
That sword bending part tho 😂😂🤣
Do a my parents react to ZAYN and Zhavia’s a whole new world 😏
you had me busting a lung at the slipper one 🤣🤣🤣
lilly pls do your parents reacting to lankybox!!!!!!
THE BARGAINING!?!??!!? I CANNOT ....

AND AUNTIEJI ... LOOOL DON'T KILL ME
Lily/Lilly Singh if your father's name is Karandeep I played a Snapchat game with him just now if you want to know more information my snap is @brenwick61
Only if Dany hd such 3 powerful chappals like Ramsay instead of dragons 😂😂
That was fun. John Snow looks a bit like Prince. :D
'Jetinder snow', 'auntie Gee' 😂
Danaerys: "Jitendar Snow... "

Jitendar Snow: "Auntyji...." 😂😂😂
The intense  zooms are my favorite part 😂
I'm a simple girl who never watched a single episode of GOT☺😃😃
Please make more lgbt videos
I swear that's exactly how the Indians in Jamaica bargain! I'm dying!
Did you know that ACCUALLY HAPPEND liked this video
Hillarious 🤣🤣

The fighting scenes were hella accurate 😂
Protectors of cows 🐮 
Mother of peacocks 🦚 
❤️❤️
OMGosh I love this so much
Why lily why 😂😂😂😂I'm having cramps from laughing
As Indians, we confirm this is 100% accurate
Tyrion.  It's got to be Tyrion.  He doesn't want it, he's not power mad, he cares about people, and so what if his fighting style is "Hit Them Hard With Whatever's Handy and Hope For The Best- Fu."  He understands the GAME better than anyone.  Reeeeally hoping for this one.
Lmao when she threw the flip flop😂😂 3:33
😂😂😂 I don't even catch game of thrones but now I want to 🤣🤣🤣
T-series be making notes for the next film 😂
Lilly is so hot in that white wig!!!
Halfway through I forgot it was related to Game of thrones

LMFAO!!! Thank you for making me laugh! Really enjoyed this! Can't wait for more..

Jitendra snow 🤣🤣🤣
Daenerys was bargaining like my mother 😂😂
Great vid cant wait to see you on Nickelodeon😂😂😂😂
It would be 90% dancing and music and 10% storyline and action
Well, there always have been GOT in real in India.😂
Music will be composed by Anu Malik. With uncanny resemblance to some Korean music. But they are 100% original, because-'reasons'.
Lollll
U r amazing
Это восхитительно! Но что я здесь делаю, я же на знаю английский...
Cool.... 
real and original got come from India....
R. R Martin copy cat the idea and storyline shame hbo....
that ship bargaining scene though🤣😂
Indian ramsay:run to your brother....

Indian Rickon : starts running

Ramsay: 

Me: *dead as drogo*😁
The fighting and bargaining part is so accurate
You nailed it! The staring battle 😂😂😂 and the song at the end! Dang, wasn't that from RamLeela or BajiraoMastani? 😂😂😂. I love it. The idea was great. It's so iconic 😂😂😂
The romance bw snow & khaleesi was lit😝
Was that a cricket bat in the beginning? Wow good detail 😂
The intense fight followed by passionate dancing scene- ROFL 😭🤣😭🤣
I think something is missing
Ha.... Dhumtanana Dhumtanana Dhumtanana Dhumtanana..... Tanana Tanana........... 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Omg! This is over 100% welldone Lily! You are so talented! It cracked me up so badly 😂🤣😂🤣❤️
"how many people in our small village?" I"M DYIN'!!!! XD
The song part was Mind blowing....
Love from Indian...
Roses are red

I am not first
And neither are you :)
I differently wanna see a Indian version of Game of thrones now that was funny. My favourite bit was the haggling for the ships lol.
I luv your story booth! ;D
Please also represent South India
Fun fact: game of thrones costumes to story is actually belongs to India story inspired by Chanukya Neeti
And Valerian steel belongs to India as well

Lilly please
Particularly Telugu
You forgot the dramatic flashes. Lol
Oh my goodness 
The accuracy just killed me 
I'm deceased 😂😂😂
Real Artistry
Mother of Peacocks !  ROTFL !  Honestly I adore peacocks, they are my favorite bird !  This made me laugh too hard, it was too perfect !
The dance😂😂😂💯
Omg the music, the cricket bat, that nod aaaaa!
I lost it at 
"Oh Jitendar Snow" 
.. 
"Aunty" 😂
U are problematic.
4:50 is the song from Mastani Bajouro or whatever, lol the director is a friend of my second cousin.
LMFAO LMFAO ..... LMFAO ...This is worth being made into a GAME ...
hey wait a minute ...was this a PILOT for the actual game.
(only glitch and totally weirded me out was when you were making out with yourself  (yeah yeah I know they represent different kar-rack-turs)
:D the end is super
Hahah she remixes the theme song and made it sound more indian
“Head of the railgadee” *plays song*😂

She pulled out a cricket bat😂😂😂
Bargaining wala scene...mast hai...🤣🤣🤣
This is not realistic at all. Where is the dance battle confrontation, huh? The part where Ramsay and Jon sing to some catchy music and-
Sees the end
Ah, OK then!
Again, LILLY PLEASE DO A SAVAGE SERIES REACTION TO THE DELHI AUNTY CLIP
This is a petition to get Lilly to come back like to sign!!!

It's a really good content....deep observation.... very insightful....just that so clichéd that I can't laugh anymore
So accurate, it hurts.

The fighting scene was 200% accurate. Also I died at that "auntie ji"
😆this was amazingly done! Love it
I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO PERFECT IN MY LIFE 🤣🤣🤣🤣
T-series?
The head nods 🤣 oh my god. And when she says more wine, that head nod was epic 🤣🤣

still better than season 8
100 percent Kalyrian Steel
The way she pronounced iRon 😂
I just wanted to say you were so great at WE Day today! I had such an amazing time and your speech was very influential! (:
OMG you should make episodes. 😂😂
Saviour of cow😂🐄

When Indians try to sell anything in Markets describing the value more than its worth
The singing and dancing part though 🤣🤣🤣🙌🏾
Oh she's the best💖💖.Sometimes I forget that she is playing all the roles...she's  good in every role she does..she gets in skin of character

These songs are my new favourite songs.☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
I will definitely call this better than other indian rappers
Edit: wow so many likes!!!!
Wow how do u make so reasonable raps? Awesome
You. Are. The. New. Queen!
“ Just make Respect common sense “
Daaaamn girl ❤❤❤this is my new confidence booster song❤
THIS IS AMAIZNG!!!! The first song is absolute GOALS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can we have full versions of all three?
nicki minajs son 🤣🤣😂
All three sound awesome, and have great messages. (I'm partial to the last one, but I really love them all).
Anxiety sleeps next to me in my bed
Relatable.
Like a female version of gully boy. Niceeee
This touched my little bisexualiana
Yoh this was a really nice one . I feel you , my power song !!!!
Lilly: i dip my samosas in the kectup
Me:  i thought i was the only one😥
"What position I like, huh?
The head of the table." 
 Dammmnnnnnnnn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You are truly amazing lilly love you so so much istg ❤️🙈😻
addicted to you🥰😍
Literally no comments about the mental health one
oh my GOD i love this...i love you Lilly
Being an Indian, I can feel the lyrics of the songs and relate to them on a whole new level!😂😄 Lilly, you're sooooo creative! Much love😃♥️♥️
BI GIRLS UNITEEEE!!! <3 love you lilly
Love that homage to 3 idiots!
Fave Bollywood movie of all time

Wow ..you go girl <3
Does anyone else love and appreciate when she said “light or dark skin it’s a win” ❤️❤️❤️ I love her positivity
“Make Respect Common Sense”
Damn🔥
U r soooo beautifull
BRO WHEN SHE INTRODUCED THE FEMALE CRUSH I ACC SCREAMED IM SO PROUD OF HER
That was..... awesome ! <3 I think I just fell in love with your work all over again
One important lesson to learn for this:

Combining good with bad does not produce good. 
In fact, we should already know that a positive and a negative make a negative, not a positive--we learnt that in school, did we not?
Oml I love All Is Well from the Three Idiots!!!
Work this out
Easy
👁️❤️👉
Middle
👁️🐳ly ❤️👉
👍 if 👉 🔎 this out
"don't need fair and lovely because i love me" ICONIC


WHY ARE YOU SO WOKE UGH WE LOVE
The first one 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
🤤
U nailed it 😗❤
Giving me some Raja Kumari vibes (personally like Raja Kumari better)
There's is nothing to not love in this video and you. You're such a dope, such an inspiration. Keep this incredible work up❤️🙌💯
“What position I like?
Huh? The head of the table.”
Yay! All of this was AMAZING but the last one resonated... I kept my bisexuality hidden from various people for so long, plus all I ever saw of bi characters on tv etc were hyper sexualised, almost fetishised, characters or villains. It's so great to see more positive representation! Makes me feel less like a weirdo : ) Thank you Lilly!!
Who came here after watching Jordindian
The Rap is my Ringtone. It's on Repeat mode whole day & still I'm not bored. ❤❤❤❤❤
Did we just loose her to a girl?😂 Dude she was tripping at ya. You could have said hi. But you didn't now she is in love with a girl, it's all your fault dude!!😢😢
This was so amazing Lilly Singh! Killin it. Especially choli me peeche kya hai. I feel like it has to be played everywhere in India 🙄 sooo many messages in that short rap.

Yasssss a rap that gives us bi girls some light 💕💕💕
That girl with purple hair is Eva Marie from wwe
00:25 Absolutely flawless OMG!!!!

Man, the music was so good during the robbery. I mean, everyone played an important part but...the music... ON POINT! haha! Shout out to my sisters Amanda, Inanna, Andrea and Sofie who KILLED in this. Be sure to check out their channels and subscribe! P.S. if you were part of a heist, which role would you play?
This was SOOOO fun!!!! These awesome girls are the best to rob a bank with...especially Lilly!!! 😂😂
Inanna collabs with Amanda
Lele: am I a joke to you?
I keep imagining some robbers actually getting inspired by this and hiring a DJ lol
I was about to scroll past the video, but then I saw that there was no Lele
The “if Bollywood songs were rap” video is restricted from copyright and the comments are disabled... 😭😭😭
I wanted to smack Lily the whole time. I felt their struggle lol.
Wait a minute... Inana wasn’t with the Lelepon squad. What happened?
This be all my friends when I go out with them

Oh wait....
They don’t invite me
UGH lily I love you but i would have honestly freed the hostages and shot you Instead 😂🤣
SOFIE DOSSI AND LILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if this is a dream never wake me up also sofie and NO contortion in this video how? it doesnt make sense
When you realize that YOU'RE the Dj of the friend group😂😂
Oh my God
That really went wrong
😂😂😂😂 
The dj exposed her address, name and face...
The moment you realize Andrea the muscle isn’t shaking a paint can she’s shaking a water bottle
So the problem is not with Lilly...it's with iPhone...
Lele Pons’s “comedy” videos could nEvEr
Why is nobody talking about the production quality in the vid???????
Damn!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lilly's latest video blocked in India on copyright grounds..... WTF???  I wanna see it 😤
This is why we never saw Innana in Lele's videos anymore. She is on Amanda's side now.
Wait the bollywood rap got copyright strike , gosh
Who’s here after the Bollywood video got copyrighted
police conference in a month «We have observed a new trend in robberies, where the robbers will hire a DJ»
Girl I would have gotten so pissed that I would have shot you😒
just saying😐

But I loved it🙄
Omg They blocked her latest video!
It's Tips music they blocked it!
Amanda and Inanna together?? WHERE'S MY TEA?😏
Can this be a Netflix Series like Good Girls?! 💯
Iphone 6 charger and iphone x charger is same
Pls can you react to Bts persona .....I purple you 💜
Lilly, why is your bollywood video blocked? There's nothing much copyright about it! I love that vid!!
"I didn't wanna yell out your password in front of all these people.. 

2 minutes later 

"WHATS YOUR CHILDHOOD ADRESS IS IT THE 132 WARREN LAYNEWOOD OR THE 56 LINCOLN AVENUE?"

XD
Lele Pons getting left out by her “best friends” 😂😂
Awh I’m so proud that she says one love lily instead of superwoman
When you think you made a funny video
Whos here Cause they love Inana For AFTER??❤👀
I wish inanna was still with her group lele and Hannah
inanna was friends with lele 
now for a long time they were not seen together.
now she is doing a collab with Amanda Cerny( who also split up with lele)


hmmmm.... tea: 


edit: okay there is piping hot tea in the comments...🍵🍵🍵
Sofie Dossi could be the best spy cause she can hide easily jn small spaces!!
”everyone turn off your bluetooth” too good! 

The cop was funny as well! Lmao
The stress I felt while watching Lilly struggle was unreal 😂
“Who brought her” 😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Seems like inanna is on amanda cerny's side
I'm going to see you and Amanda at the YouTube fanfest Mumbai 

Love you Lily!
I don’t know why but I laugh every time someone says dongle🤣😂🤣😂❤️
A few month back I was like... Why isn't inanna in lele pons vids anymore... Tbh... I'm not shocked that she's in this video with Amanda
People really think this is an amazing thought out comedy video. Crazy how times are changing
this video stressed me out 😂 like damn, Lilly, shut upppppp girl 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
I WANNA BE SOFI DOSSI LIKE A CONTORTIONIST
I saw you on Wikipedia 😲🤣 March 2019
Now I'm your huge fan #LiLLy
This is the best Kalab ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️🤣🤣🤣
Question for Inanna
Are you still friends with Lele Pons and Hannah Stocking?

Plz reply
The amount of people who didn't look at the thumbnail and just liked
👇
I can't watch the new video after this one.. dang.😭 I was so hype for it.
Only superwoman would assign a DJ in bank robbary
I was like OMG IS THAT SOFFIEEE DOSSII IN THE THUMBNAIL
When she pulled up her mask for Face ID 😂😂
I’m dying, “does anyone have an iPhone charger” “the dongle” 🙈😂😂😂
Ok honestly I wanted to slap her lmao 😂
Why did she have to say she’s the DJ 🤦🏽‍♀️😂 she could’ve Assistant Wheels and stayed in the car. 😏😂🤷🏽‍♀️

This needs to be a Netflix series!
Are you telling me...


That SOFIE AIN'T THE MUSCLE??
ok so lele dosent hangout with inanna anymore. than innana makes a video with amanda cerny who is lele’s ex friend..? i smell drama 🤔🤨
God Lilly you made everything so awkward lol
She said dongle so many times that it started to sound weird😂
If I was one of the members I would shoot her and continue to rob the people's cash😂😂
0:35 Lilly is me in a group project
They all showing their faces, of course it failed!
Lilly: do you guys have a dongle?

Amanda:
i--i don't know what that is
That cinematic effect on a comedic skit tho 🔥🔥🔥 I do the same thing on my videos; it adds flavor!
3:46 GIMME UR PHONE
Lawl ;)
What's wrong with Lilly's channel just 700k Views?😥
Why is everybody talking about inanna and Amanda like can we just talk about how funny this video was😂🙏...keep on going Lily you’re doing great
MY SOFFI DOSSI

"It locked again! Inanna I need your face.
Calling 911
Guys we need to leave. 
Should I play bye bye bye?'
🤣

Girl Love should team up with Shethority. That would be so cool!
My favorite part about Lilly Singh's videos is the captions. They're hilarious!

(DISCLAIMER: I don’t actually mean this to anyone, I just heard it) Yo mama is a kind, honest, caring, wonderful person. 
ALL the girls together ... ... now that was a HEIST!

It's springbreak 2.
Hey so I was wondering if you were going to address your coming out as bi. As someone struggling with coming out maybe you could talk about how you decided to come out. I would love that thanks! If your not ready no pressure tho lol.
actually what makes you and me so devastated
Omg innana and Amanda 
This means inanna and lele doesn't talk anymore

One of my favourite vids by her😀
SOFIE IS A ROBBER!!!!!!!!
Amanda cerny and Inanna in the same video? What's up with lele pones
This was so creative
This is Good Girls, I love you but this feels plagiarized. Even the lines seem the same from when they rob that grocery shop. The 5 minutes... everything adds up. I love that show so I really hope you give them credit💗
OMG that Sofie dossi cuz I love her

YOU SHOULD DO A COLLAB WITH LAUREN JAUREGUI FOR GOD'S SAKE. I SAW YOUR POST AND I WAS LIKE....PLEASE DO A VIDEO FOR GOD'S SAKE.
As if women would try and pull this off😂😂 they would have gotten arrested in a blink of an eye
I loved everyone except for Inanna
Funnier than Lele's videos
This shud be made a movie...
Lilly fighting!

This video must have been expensive. But Ure the best utuber.
Sofie was the driver cuz her brother newer let's her to drive
The production on this incredible, literally feels like im watching a movie

This was a good video, but waiting for your normal solo/parents' videos ❤
This is one of the best songs I have ever seen!! Kudos to you @||Superwoman||, and wish you all the best in the future! You are an inspirations for the millions of people that watch you. Love you from one of your admirers.

I never felt so mad damn
Yo Lilly love your videos. BON I'm 13. Guess what last Halloween I and my friends did the Halloween heist from Brooklin 99 and every character that you've portrayed in this video was us. Except for the Demolitionist we had a Sniper which was me. I'm pretty buff but in the team there was a guy who was way more buff than me and he gotta be the Muscle. Thank you for the joy you've given me.

P S - This is my phone and I'm a guy. This phone used to belong to my grandmother. She's alive please don't freak out.
Sofie Dossi was in this?! OMG she’s meh idol 😏😊💜
I loved this
“Create, Sleep, Repeat” is a weird slogan for a bank.
How is this a video without Lele and Hannah

I feel if you wanted a good robbery, dude just make Sofie the brains then shell just slide her way into the vaults
Lol!!! Charger!
Dear superwoman’s can u do types of people who roast other people xd
0:58 Seatbelt instinct: When someone tells me to repark the car 20 feet away.
So innana and Amanda
What's lele's opinion about this
Awwwwwwwwww Lilly could have been the look out mm 😔 awesome video though 👌🏼👍🏼😊
Lele probably would have made the video wierd but some parts would have been funny maybe lele should have been in the video if her and watchmicall it can scarsh it and be friends
So what happened to inanna and lele relationship? Just curious.
I clicked THE SECOND I got the notification😂😂
this made me so angsty
This gave me so much anxiety
And remember kids, wear your seatbelts.
Yep. I would be the DJ in a heist
Inanna and Amanda never thought that would happen maybe that’s why her and lele  pons  have not made a video together in ages
oammggggg all of my favorite people all together in one video!!!😀😀😀😍😍🤗🤗 well except sophie i dont know who she is sorry
The frick is a dongle?!
The frick is a dongle?!
Me texting my friends asking them if I'm the DJ of the group
Oh hey Zach Dossi I MEAN SOFIE DOSSI
LMAO  SO FUNNY 😂 !
This is the exact reason why you use an android phone because you can always connect to the aux cord without any difficulties
'Radio. It's like TV, without the colours.'   LOOOLLLLLLL
Guys I don't know if I am not updated or something but was anyone else thinking about the fact that inanna is in the same video as Amanda and lele had some beef and inanna is best friends with lele okay I have noticed inanna not really being in photos or hanging out with hannah or lele in a long time but they were still all besties

I am so sorry guys if I missed something no hate at all just curiosity 
Love them all so please only bring good vibes
You was on Jimmy Fallon
just awful, arrest them all
lol 😂😂😂😂😂😋😂😂😋😂 you are yonic
Do this again but secret Agents
150 views and 500 comments, youtube is high again 😂
that was painful to watch
Sooooo are lele pons and inanna sarkis beefing????
Andrea is Carli bybel's DOPPELGANGER
howd she type with her gloves on????
please collaborate with Joanna Ceddia!
Should have made everyone keep their arms up and then dance 😂😂😂
This was great😂
After that I drink tea
Lilly I'm watching kids choice awards now I looooooove u girl power
Why am I lily
M just here to say m sooooo mad at the copyright on the latest video ,lets fight for it team super
I feel like I will be lily
At least Lele isn't in this one thank god
Pleas can I get Sophie 's number
I really like this video it was really good
Amazing 😂😂
lol soffie doesn't even know how to drive
Thank God I'm seeing Amanda after so looooooonng
I honestly think sofie dossi shows off a lot
Every squad needs a DJ
I hope she does more high quality skits. This was awesome.
Finally another vid
How are all of them so pretty?
Not like I would ever be involved in a robbery but I would def be Lilly!Yea I don’t have nice friends-_-
😱😱😱yes I love these 😁😁😁
Lilly is literally me every time I hang out with my friends
who wants another types of people video
MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
Oof you just got copyrighted
There's a living doll on your video
Is this channel PG?
I needed a video like this.  Felt refreshing somehow.  Barely any scenes in whatever that feature a heist crew are all-gals.  I generally like that stuff but this has an energy that I am not familiar with and am happy for it even being a thing.
Isnt Inna in after?
Why did lily actually make me so mad in this
as long as lele pons isn’t here, we’re good
Lele and Hannah could never
O my GOOHHOOODD
bahaha! love you, dear!
I held back my upload to check you out first👍 
                         💪Super💪
😱.........I AM THE DJ 😝😭😭😭
Who else is waiting for a movie written and directed by Superwoman.
Does Sofie even have a drivers license???
really like drama situations like this, so Fun.. waiting for another..
Oceans 8 reboot
So cringy🙄

Lol may not agree with you on politics but this was funny
shouldn’t she have been the eyes instead of the hacker?
this made me so mad.
Me when I saw soffi 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂yasss queen
The quality of this video is beyond amazing! Lilly you put so much effort Into your work. 👏🏽 I applaud you. The DJ totally blew this operation up and her choice of music was WACK!! Also, that phone charger Issa a must 😂 and I’ve never heard of a dongle before this lol.
Am I the only one getting “good girls” vibes from this lol
OMG Annoying DJ robber!!😂😂
They should make part2 who else agree

I love that Lilly has long videos that actually are good videos.
I think I enjoyed this video more than one should enjoy a video
This was soooo funny I acc prefer when she takes longer cos Lilly’s videos are bomb and feel that they have a lot more  prepared and feels like she hasn’t had to rush it ❤️love u lily
F**k this was awesome 😂
lele left the chat

This is why you should never rob banks kids
Hilarious!
this video reminds me kf the movie ocean's 8
this should be in a movie it should be called the robbed  girls
Just waiting for the days when she starts to make vedios that are relatable.. like a girl next door.😔 she used to be one.
Is this real?
Congratulations on trending!
I think this is based off good girls
one love..lilly.
You should have your parents react to money by cardi b or thotiana by cardi b and bluface
Ocean's 5
This is the type of videos i love!!
😭 not cool
I just saw an ad on YouTube for Olay, and Lilly was in it
Wait where did your rap video go?
I would always be the DJ. That’s an insight on my friends
Lol Lilly! That was frustrating and funny at the same time🤦😂
The girl with the frizzy hair is so beautiful
Ocean’s Six
If lele and amanda were in the same video....
Hot squad
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
Is that a hate comment to lele coz everybody says that i clicked coz there's no lele
So hard to watch
dear lord the sheer amount of eyeroll for this video.
Now we know why robbers have a DJ 😂
Omg sofie !! Love you
No masks,lol
reminds me of choices
911 was funnier than that
I genuinely do not find you even remotely funny. Yes, you can be wholesome, and you are such a kind person, but you are not funny.
Lit!!
Thankfully I could download the "If Bollywood Songs were Rap" after it got removed!! It's soooooo good!!
DUDEDUDE WHY DIDN'T YOU COME OUT ON YOUTUBE I LGIT HAD TO DO REASEARCH I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BI UNTIL I HEARD ON YOUTUBE
INANNA AND AMANDA= NEW DUO
Where did her last Bollywood video go?
🤣
I feel bad because I got really mad at lilly 😂
Oh look - it’s all women, it’s all women in your videos. Because you’re not really interested in women being on an equal footing with men.  I kind of expected that.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I’m GONE
I would be the Brain of the robbery, lol ❤️😂
👇
Omg this has my favorite YouTubers. Dreams really do come true
Love watching you !!!😍😍😂😂
Who else was expecting they're gonna promote some kinda speakers?
This means Lele and Inanna are not friends anymore?
Crime alert! This video stole my interest and liking 😄👏🏾. Keep the good work guys  ⭐️!
Dang innana betraying lele😔😂
who else saw her Insta and got excited?
since she does a bank robbery go right

PS I liked my own comment BC I alone and single
Just realised after not being her for a year this Chanel is for 9-12 year olds.
I'm 15
This wasn't funny
If I was ever in a heist, it'd go like this
Hi shofie I  now you
Lilly is me in my friend group
What did I just bare witness to and why is it on trending???
But why did you dye your hair and I don't see you with lele pones anymore
It's funny how lilly makes herself look goofy all the time  but she is so intelligent
please. stop
When you're binge watching Lily's
vids and then you get a notification for a new video
Yo she start saying their names addresses and showing their faces I’m done with Lilly 😂😂😂
This is why music lovers shouldn't rob banks.
Sofie dossi and superwoman are a deadly duo
Lilly omg I’m deadd
There’s a perfect ratio of most to least attractive in that thumbnail
Sofie dossi can’t even drive😂😂😂😂(sorry if I spelled you name wrong Sofie)
This is what I am 0:51
I’m glad that Lele pons wasn’t in this video
too messed up
One like = 1 💵
How much did lilly steal
Yay no lele
sofie dossi!!!😍😍😍💖💖
Wow all the cringy people in one vid! You've outdone yourself Lily.
love u sofie
why does everyone suddenly hate lele pons?
LOVE IT
I know you got this idea from the heist movie 'Widows'.
No problem, I won't tell anyone.
I'm only here for Amanda
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
i love watching you sooo much your so funny and kind!
Lele s old bestie and her new one shagshshdfjfgj
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LOL
I thought in sofies vid she said or her brother said that she doesn't know how to drive
Lily Singh aka the backstabbing robber
this reminds me of oceans 8
Terrible 😂
The if Bollywood songs were rap video is restricted in Canada!
doesn’t the iphone six use the same charger as all the new phones?
I’m glad she got Sofie to be in the video ❤️
I’m glad she got Sofie to be in the video ❤️
I’m glad she got Sofie to be in the video ❤️
Inanna😍😩
This should have been a short movie. Make more!
Ocean's five?
HAHAHAHAHHAHASHHSUISJWW
Yo, it's been a while.......
So Inanna hates Lele now too...
MOLLYYYYYY
Please include laugh tracks, due to my low IQ I am not able to understand your super amazing "comedy".
Lilly what happened to Lana Steele ????????????????????????????
The "demolitionist"  looks like a french female tennis player called Alize Cornet! Check her out!
Hahaha oof
Wait does this mean lele and inanna aren't friends anymore? I mean Amanda and lele aren't really on speaking terms ya know?
Inanna with Amanda now?????? wow!
inanna is molly samuels in after movie!! where are the #afternators at??
Really lilly
This was sooooo funnyy yayayayaya
😂😂😂😂
Sofie doesn't deserve to be in that vid
Maryam
I used to be obsessed with watching your videos a few years ago but then I just lost interest in them idk why but now this is the first time I'm watching one of your videos in years and I kinda regret not watching your videos...hehehe
Hey y did ur Bollywood vid get taken down ? I cant watch it
I just wanna hit Lily ‘cause she ruined it lol
sofie dossi u would not do this
HILARIOUS
Gosh I miss her old videos
Well I have
This was hardly funny! You're getting closer to Lele Pons.
Love your skits
I feel Lilly’s pain when I’m with my FREINDS I have to go what about me
Out of everyone Amanda had to be in this video.
Where’s your music video gone?
This video irritated me ! Really annoying gosh ,overkill
And this is why people say women aren't funny.
I don't know why, but this didn't make me laugh. Lily always makes me laugh but this didn't.
Love you
Where is Lele Pons "THE MASTER MIND* 😂😂😂😂😂😂
her skits are not really good tbh..
I love you guys’d
First
Did I just see you on the kids choice awards
Thank god lele pons is not there
Lmao!!! I'd be Lily!

It's funny how Sofie is the diver and she doesn't even have a driver's license 😂

I would just shoot lily, sorry.
Hi Lily, you are coming for YouTube fan fest in Mumbai just in front of my office.. I didn't knew.. OMG. I wanted to meet you.. is there a chance I can catch up with you in Mumbai. Anyplace...
😂😂
I swear rob a bank with a 16 year old and this would happen

SOFIE 💜
I can’t believe this is my life. Thanks for being here. Comment below with segment ideas for my new show!! We’re in this together fam!!!
everyone watching this can say we all knew you before you became a tv show celebrity
When you’ve been a fan since the green wall
Just a suggestion; I think you should make a channel and post every episode on it for those who literally can't watch. (If possible)
I am not telling you to, I'm just making the suggestion because some people really can't watch, including me, and I really do want to see it so bad!
Remember watching you in front of the wall of awkward picture jokes 😂😂 OMG I can’t believe it I’M SO PROUD OF YOU!!! <33
I love it when she says all jokes aside but she’s holding a shoe😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Use me as a “I’m so proud of you Lily” button.
"Taking a break for mental health. Not trying to get on the trending page... I got my own the show guys! Muh depression is cured!".

Congratulations 😻😻😻 I can't watch the show here from Indonesia, but I'll keep supporting you in any way I can😻😻
I seriously hope you do well.  Just a piece of advise, be somebody that promotes a positive message and own up to shortcomings in character.
Welp, there goes her channel (more than it has been lately) lol you've barely been uploading, this used to be your passion. I'm happy for you! But it seems as if money does cure depression.
 "I will still be here for you guys." LOLOL yeah right!!!!

It's first time I see someone who pray with slippers
That's measurement of excitement😂😂








Btw congrats I'm really happ for you
Lilly you are amazing ❤️❤️❤️
i know u hardly do all this anymore but pls do a video about bparding schools
0:47 lmao is the slipper a symbol of your indian culture getting smacked to encourage you to be successful? Don't take it to heart, I'm indian. I know the drill. All jokes aside your happiness is so contagious, I'm glad. Really needed that. Congrats Lilly can't tell you how long I've been here and continue to be cuz you're so humble. Maybe if I gain recognition someday, it would be an honour to be on your talk show omfg❤
You should discuss the topic of dowry in India. Why it still exists? Why India oppresses women, where is the equality?? And even compare it to East Asian countries where it's the men who pay the dowry.
Good idea Lilly, the night shows invaded YouTube so you invade the night shows, intelligent
Had to share how happy I am for you in this awesome  new journey ❣️
So very well deserved ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️  Wishing you the very best.
So excited for you 😃
Dude i wouldnt be surprised if you suddently posted a video telling us you were gonna be the US president 😂👏❤️

YYYAAAAYYYY!!!!! SO EXCITED FOR YOU!!! You so deserve this!!! Cannot wait to see what greatness you achieve!!!!
SO proud! 😭❤️
Damn Lilly i see you
Yes you do what you want to proceed with your dreams I want that talk show to come in September because that's my birthday
So proud of you 😭
awwwwwwwww that means a lot to me and thanks for all the great videos
Anyone get scared when she picked up the chancla
This is such amazing news! Can't wait to see what you create on NBC :) Thanks for putting so much brilliant, hilarious, and original content. This is going to be a heck of a ride :)
Yasssss!!!!! You deserve it girl!!! 💰
Haha you should have your guests each ride in on a motorized unicorn 🦄 the kind the kids scoot around on in malls
liked for the SLIPPER!!!
Omg!!!!! I'm gonna try my best to watch all of it!
Oye Hiro girl 😢I am confused
So happy for you ♥️
Watching your interview on NDTV! I am an older female youtuber. Thanks for your videos and advice. My subs are small but I keep it fun!
Omg Lily I'm so happy for you!!!
So you're excited about coming from a 14 million subscriber base to going on mainstream TV which nobody watches lol
NOT JUST INTERVIEWING CELEBRITIES LIKE EVERYONE DOES WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA TOO I BELIEVE.. OTHER PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOCIETY IN POSITIVE WAYS (like yourself) AND REMAIN UNRECOGNISED WOULD BE REFRESHING!!
Congratulations!! I am so happy for you and I am soooo excited. I can't wait to see how you will change the late night show industry.
Congrats bro 😎😎😎
Susan is coming
You are like the dopest person I've ever met I thought of booking tickets for YouTube FanFest Mumbai 2019 but to my shock they got sold out in only 5 hours
But still we'll catch up in some other parts of our lives 
Edit:  I liked my own comment cuz I know no-one else  will
Edit: I think a little late with Lilly Singh is premiering September because of her birthday
Edit:Like about a month or two ago James Charles and Lilly Singh were almost having equal subscribers but now jams charls has 15 million subscribierres and I'm like hooooowwwwww
I just literally just watched your Olay add lol I love it!
Congratulation girl i am so happy for you
WAIT SEPTEMBER IS THE MONTH IWAS BORN IN


JESUS LOVES ME YES I KNOW-

OUR QWEEN IS FINALLY GETTING WHAT SHE DESERVES - a fellow asian
Hey Lilly, I know you probably won’t read this, but I don’t know if you’ve heard or not, but here in New Zealand, there has been a shooting at a mosque in Christchurch, and it’s the first one that’s happened in decades. Anyway, I was just wondering if you could send out a prayer or post something to support all the poor people affected by the incident. Thank you 😊
-Aleisha
I love you so f*ckiiiiiiiiin' much
Congratulations! We all are supporting you throughout this journey! Sending much love from Canada!❤️❤️
You're awesome. You deserve it! All best and i hope it's a smashing success!
You inspire us so why not have your dream come true... Mwuhhaaa love you superwoman
I've been watching any and all videos related to your announcement over and over again. Lilly, I'm genuinely, so happy for you. I actually started crying watching your vlog. You're just AAAH amazing (understatement), and I love you so so so much. Thank you for being my Superwoman, always. 


Whatever you went through which caused you to change your intro and outro from Superwoman to Lilly, I understand and acknowledge that, but know that regardless of what the people say, sometimes your own 'fans' say, anyone says...you have been, are, and always WILL be a bawse SUPERWOMAN. You give the title its true meaning, and no one and/or thing can ever take that away. 


I...love you. 
You are a genuine, kind, humble, loving, confident, intellectual human being and it SHOWS.
I’m. So excited I can’t wait to watch your t.v  show

You look an indian
Ok, ok...segment Ideas let's see.. 

Before i do that: CONGRATULATIONS Lilly!! It's been a long time cominggg! Cannot wait to see what you make!

There should be a tea segment that does not gossip, but highlights common opinions about  everyday behaviour. Defo have questions for the public (talk on the street) and then an expert or guest come in to talk about the topic handy.

Animation is good (I want you to be the creator of the next "Simpsons" type cartoon girlie

Great sketches of course

Musical performances and dance

etcetera. You got this giiiirlll
Yaaay congrats !!
Congrats Sups!
I sometimes forget when I'm watching paramjeet and manjeet that it's actually   Lilly
Wow well done ,🤩🤩🤩
WE LOVE YOU LILLY <3 <3
Moi? watch a talk show? I would watch Lilly's! Not like my parents would let me. LOL

CONGRATS LILLY <3 I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU !!!! You deserve it so much !
You are behaving like that you have gotten your first oscar.
Proud of you
Well deserved, good luck.
Ok guys, I just wanna say that something good can happen to you and you can be excited and still be depressed. For some people, depression isn't the foremost thing, 24/7, so for her it might be lingering in the back of her head and this has made it better. Also, some of the people I thought were the happiest were some of the most depressed out of my friends/acquaintances so people can also be really good at hiding it. Just saying
Omg brown people gonna have a late night host. All the white hosts have left the muthaeffin chat...... 🔥🔥🔥🔥
what happened with the snapbacks...used to wear them all the time
Amazing!!!
lmfao 1:39
Aw, Lilly..you truly are an inspiration. You’re one of the hardest working individuals, period. You deserve this and it’s going to be GREAT. Can’t wait 🤗

The saddest state of our world. How pathetic
I've always wanted to be in a show! I'm young and I always pictured myself as being older Judith in The Walking Dead but it's to late...... I've only had one hope and that's in my dreams..... I don't even know where to go for an audition for anything, it's like they keep them top secret. You inspire me to try my best... Thank you and I wish you all the luck with your show! 
                                                                                                               -XoXo, Paige

*240p* 😭😂I'm dead
5:54 Lilly proving that she’s bi.
I like your skits but I really liked this video.
MAKE THIS A SERIES. unedited, uncut footage of whatever you want to rant about.
CONTINUE THIS RANT VIDEOS. MAKE A FREAKKING SERIES OF THIS. BECAUSE THIS IS GOLD😍🔥
Omg I loved her😂how can somebody talk continuously on camera, not lose their chain of thought and still be so hilarious?! 😂😂❤️
Lily: I’ve never used a dating app

Also Lilly: hold my beer

When she was talking about her safe bubble and that people in her real life shouldn’t be in her safe little bubble y’all I FELT that
How did I miss her coming out as bi!? Been waiting for this for ages! Superwoman and Anna Akana in a matter of months, 2019 is killing it!! ♥️
"I threw my iPhone 10 it turned into 2 iPhone 5 !!"😂😂😂😂
This video is so refreshing without all the editing and production
Lilly we want more unedited rants, this was sooo good
At 5:58 when she said “deeper human connection” my WiFi effed up and YouTube show me the “no connection” notification... gurlllll lmaoooooooooo
Lilly: this not even a picture of you!
Also lilly: tried to upload picture of her dog
OMG I just woke up and saw the news!!!  OUR BAWSE IS GONNA HAVE A TV SHOW!!! I almost woke up my child and fell out of bed. 

I'm so happy for you. You deserve this and so much more. I CANT WAIT!!!!!
Aligning chakra's + deeper human connection + om tattoo = LA lies. Got it🤣🤣🤣 

This was absolutely brilliant!!! THIS content is what I wanna see on YouTube every single day. You're amazing Lilly ❤️

“i threw my iPhone 10 and it turned into 2 iPhone 5s”

Lol lilly
Congratulations on the new late night spot!
"If I had a dollar for every time I saw someone with an Om tattoo, I would be richer than I am right now." 

#humbleBrag 😂
Hahaha..Lol "your trying to use at horizontal picture on a vertical  platform and your trying to get a date. 240 p relationship... You need a Life coach..."
This is the lilly I've been waiting forrrrr 😂😂😂😂😂 I freaking love you. Do more like this!!!!
Yes girl! This should be a series! I loved the laidback vibe from this and it suits your style of humor well. I feel like you'd be good at storytimes too and probably have some crazy stories from your travels.
Getting the old Lilly vibes 🤣
Amazing, as always! ❤

Peace out,
Zara
Honestly one of my favourite videos from you😂💖💜💕 speaking straight FACTS!!
"You trying to use a horizontal picture on a VERTICAL platform !!!?"

I imagine all the people That watch this and immediately search through all the dating apps in the world to find and match with Lilly
I laughed so hard that my neighbors peeped outta their windows!!!😂😂😂😂
*Immediately downloads Bumble and goes to LA 😂😅
This reminds me of the old Lily YEAAAAAAAHHHHHH

im glad this was raw and unedited. your fans still love you even if there’s no editing or effects added
OMG.... CONGRATS ON THE NBC SHOW!!!! Much Love Unicorns😉✌💚
"My iPhone 10 turned into two iPhone 5's" 🤣🤣🤣
Girl THANK YOU! Low resolution photos on dating apps are unacceptable ! I feel you, I tried using dating apps in many occasions in my life and I just...yeah no...not for me, I'd rather meet new people in person.
Also I've missed these rant style videos, lily please do a podcast or something of just rants.
Man this is too relevant for me right now. I need to go old fashioned and speed date irl or SOMETHING
I love how smoothly she admitted that she also swipe on girls. We stan a bi and out queen ❤️
SHE WAS ON JIMMY FALLON TONIGHT SHOW 3/14


I HEARD THE NEWS 🤣👍
Your rants are why I originally subscribed 😊 Love hearing your unedited thoughts! Do more rant videos again!!!!Please!!!!
Omg you have the Trinidad 🇹🇹 flag on your nailsss💖

"stop making adventurous a thing. It's not a thing" I'm like here is the Regina George of YouTube 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Btw I’m a small youtuber
Congratulations on your late night show! Just saw the news on the internet and had to come on YouTube to post congrats. You are going to do great things. You are an inspiration! #TeamSuper
Is that Trinidad's flag on your nails
4 sips of beer and my girl's already high up there
lmao, i'm you every single time someone messes up. xD
The best part of this video was when Lilly was openly talking about girls’ dating profiles, because it means she’s comfortable enough to talk about it and I’m just so proud of her for coming out and telling us about this part of her life.
Missing that intro
We need more unedited rants like this!!!!😂😂😂😭😭😭
lILY I LOVE UR VIDS BUT IN THIS VIDEO YOU ARE DRUNK AF
This video is so funny to me I just love how exited she is💕
Lily might've discovered the next evolution of her content.
Humble might be your soul mate...ya never know. Just throwing it out there ;-)
Your genuine laughter melts my heart! 💕
Lilly!! We need more unedited rant videos of whatever you wanna rant about! Loved this so much! I relate to you love 😍💖😂💖
Wow... watching this video reminded me of her old rant videos which is why i subscribed to her channel. She's such a great storyteller and I almost forgot about it. I feel like if she goes back to more of these storytime/rant videos she'll be able to reconnect with her old subs and gain new ones too!
 I like these authentic rants over her edited skits, but those are good too.
Highkey about to fly back to Cali to find Lilly in person and give her my number
I need to get mynpopcorn for this one. Lady!!!! The stories I could tell you!!! 🙄 Soooo many flakes in the dating app pool.
first time viewer of lily but i like her too much so funny 😂 I imagine all people searching dating apps to find and match for lily.. 

You make my day lily..tnx for the horizontal and vertical photos..😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 lawd I’m crying Lilly y’all is too much 😂😂😂😂 a whole lotta foolishness 😂😂😂😂 from the snapchat photos to the namest-slay 😂😂😂 wiv a 240p relationship 😂😂😂

I have a feeling that that wasn't the first "hard cider" of Lilly's day😉😂❤️

Great video though, we need more of these awesome unedited rants
I love you Lilly and this video is a whole mood, especially the last part 😂😂❤️❤️
I love the fact that this is unedited, it’s so real and like behind the scenes kinda feel - love it
Lilly you were IN BAD MOMS 😝😀😄
REALLLY MISSED THESE KINDA VIDS
When you're watching this video and drinking at the same time.. Let's just say I got a lot of cleaning to do now... 😂😂
The 1.4k people that disliked this video are the people who are on these dating apps that she’s talking about 😂
Can we talk about the fact that Lily is swiping on dudes AND girls? 🙌🏼
I really want you to make more unedited rants because a lot of us would be able to relate! I also luv ur videos!!
This video, Oh my go Lilly! 😂😂😂 
These uncut rant type videos make me roll on the floor laughing 😂❤
Yo girl, i could hear you ranting all day. You're like a mantra video. Love you Lily!
lilly,YOU HAVE YOUR OWN NBC SHOW AND I AM SOOOOOOO SOOO SOO VERY HAPPY😭😭 I've ben crying since 30 mins now..*actually,yes.30* I watched jimmy's video and my heart literally skipped not one., But probably 7 beats..I INSTANTLY CALLED MY BEST FRIEND who is also a GREAAT GREAAAT GREEAAAT FAN of yours and also texted..almost everyone!!
To
A Little Late with Lilly Singh, 
All of my support,love and hardest fangirling. Keep doing such phenomenal things and keep making TEAM SUPER proud. I really hope that I could fly to LA and talk to you..but thats not really possible right now.. well its not about me..its about YOU.
ALL THE LOVE. KEEP RAISING THE BAR❤️👍
Lilly: “stop trying to make adventurous happen”
Regina george:”stop trying to make fetch happen!”
😂
Loved this! PSA: turn down volume at 7:28.
Damn! I really am famous in LA 😂
Lol,this was funny,I love u lilly,u r such an inspiration, u deserve way more than u have,and aren't like other youtubers..😁❤
OMG, I am shook that you actually tried dating apps. Truthfully, though this video was hilarious! I died laughing! I know that you were worried that we wouldn't think its funny, but it truly was! Loved it. Favorite part was your reaction to seeing a friend on the dating app. "how dare you real person enter my fake world!" Comedy gold!
"im on this dating app because im a sad embarassed person and i wanna be in this safe bubble of not real life" WE STAN A RELATABLE QUEEN
hahahaha I absolutely loved this, everything was accurate 😂
Wow jus watched d Jimmy show n d  announcement omg woww.... U go girl...getting ur own show.. proud of u.. Lots luv ❤😘😍💞frm me n my grl gang frm 🇮🇳
Can I just say, all I did through the entire video was stare at lilly's nails...
Also, the nails totally match the cap of the beer bottle 0:28
How many times is she gonna say “ I swear to god “ 😂😂
Oh Lilly... I do t think that’s what they meant by ‘adventurous’..... 😂






Coming from someone who made the same mistake of living under a rock and finally trying to download a dating app, then promptly regretting it.






Ps, more unedited rants please? This is the balance of relatable content we out here for 😍
You are funny Lilly!!! You got a natural sense of humor and you laugh with people not at people and that is great!!! :)
Aite lilly, help me get some matches on my bumble and tinder acct please... 😂
Hilarious😂😂😂❤❤❤
WoW nice to see you Lilly
Good luck with dating 
Soo funny nice to see the funny Lilly again
I love these rants, still my favorite YouTube
6:55 I’m dead 😂 😂 + bonus 7:30 lol 😂
BAHAHAHAHAHA omggggg you make my dayyy 
i also feel a little guilty :')))
wooooow i missed ur rants SO MUCH !!! and YOU !!! still happy to see ur doing amazing !!
4:51 me when I'm about to make a very important point

I’d swipe right for Lilly. 100%! Who else would??
Hey you, scrolling down the feed. Turn your volume up for this message. 7:29 🖤

Have a nice day! :)
Expected nothing from this video. Ended up liking it way too much. Sending love your way in abundance.
Also girl, did you do your nails? Lave it! 😘 Heart heart
Terrifying experience, just like me! :-p
this is pure gold. I was legit just smiling the entire time.. reminds me of your old videos. Love you just being yourself, Lilly!
I love how innocent she is that she thinks “adventurous” on a dating app means liking the outdoors.
NO LILLY THAT IS NOT WHAT IT MEANS 😂
I expected her to show the profile and the chats😅😂
7:56       9:30     Kinda contradicted herself oooooof
Omggggg are those nails painted like the Trini flag ayeeeeeeee
"our relationship is gonna be the same quality as this picture" I CANT
IISuperwomanII drinking beer the whole time  while talking is literally me
U can use Raggachat
Lovvveeeeee your Trinidadian nails😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love Lilly’s content but damn I forgot how much I missed her rants
THESE KINDS OF VIDEOS ARE AMAZINGG
This is the type of unscripted Lilly I signed up for 🔥
When’s the next meet and greet? Everyone gonna give their number to her😂
That feeling when you see your ex-teacher on tinder
I am so proud right now! Lilly CONGRATS ON UR NBC SHOW I CANNOT WAIT. I AM SCREAMING. ALL THE LOVE XXX
LOL you look like you’re drunk 🤣🤣🤣
HOW DARE YOU REAL PERSON ENTER MY BEAUTIFUL FAKE WORLD! lol! 🤣
WHOA!! please make more of these kind of videos!
Now m thinking how many people hv try to track u in dating apps and how many fake Lilly pop up🤣
Didn't stop smiling! Good job Lilly!
This video is so organic and pure that I feel so healthy watching this 100% real Lily with no editing and my girl is still funny
Bro I missed this side of you. I don't need those high production, videos. You and your great personality was enough for me. I'm not telling you what to do or anything, I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed this video because it reminded me of the old times. ❤️
I like videos like these...you should make more..and story times
Our relationship is going to be like this photo. 240p!
😂😂😂
Pleeeeasee do more of these random uncut rants! Loved this!
”EVERY WHITE GIRL WITH AN OM TATTOO”

Every Hindu: 😑

This felt like the OG vibes!😍😍
Yess girll post more of these kind of vids!😁🙌🙌❤❤
I need 100 more of these unedited rants
"Your pasta is a 10. It's a 10. What are you!?"
😆😆😆😆😆
Lilly: I tried dating apps!
Me: ooh, this seems interesting 
Lilly: (Unedited Rant) 
Me: Oh, here we go
i had the same experience 😂 when i saw my friend on tinder .. i uninstalled it the very first day i installed
So relatable 
So funny 
Sank you
VERY REFRESHING! I prefer these unscripted vids.
Low quality photos = your date being pleasantly surprised when you look so much better in real life! Am I right?
OMG LILY U WERE IN GIRLS LIKE YOU BY MAROON 5  YOU WERE DOING DANCE MOVES BEHIND HIM
Lilly: "You tryna get a horizontal picture on a vertical platform? You need to do better"
Me: You should tell that to Ariana Grande's Instagram photos 😅
I really enjoyed this style of video Lilly! 🖤🖤 just you talking to us made me abundantly happy 😊💟💟
okay, so~ I LOVE LILLY! She really made my day XD
I want NUUUUUMBER ONE back ❤️
I love the realness and Honesty in this Video it's Everything ❤
“Am I on tinder or am I on post-mates” 😂😂😂😂😂😂 ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS
I love how sometimes you do a slight twang of an Indian accent! It’s just sooooo friggen CUTE😁
The worst thing about his video is that it ends! lol
 If I was living at LA I would approach you and ask fro your number for sure girl! You are amazing!
You are the bomb.com by the way! 
MORE RANTS FROM YOU PLEEEEASE 🙏
“i would be richer than i already am” at least she knows it

CANT RELATE
You're late! We've been knowing the foolery on OLD 🤣🤣
I love this style of video for you. I think this is a really good fitting form of content. I'd love to see more ily
This is so funny love you Lilly ❤️ you inspire me and make me have a good day everyday I watch your videos my 1st favorite YouTuber I swear I love you so much 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️

Girl, then Ima go meet you in real life. SHE'S A QUEEN 😍😍😍
I have been on these dating apps and i seriously thought that its just me who think funny about horizontal pics and the f with snapchat filter pics 🤣🤣 lilly be like , been there done that.

Bumble seriously asks for your LIVE SELFIE to make sure it matches with your other pics
Yasss to that nail polish tho!!! You're an honorary Trini for sure!! 🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹 @IIsuperwomanII
Lily ft rants are LIFE RELATES
Me and my friends download tinder for a laugh once 😂 

We’re too young for it 😂😂 

Of corse us being us we decided to do it in a club full of lil kids 😂 we got in trouble by the group ‘leaders’ 😅😂😂
Lilly: One Love Lilly, that is. Wrap and.....

Me: Lilly should find another gesture to represent Lilly instead of the S symbol.

Also me, WTH, she is still super.😊
BUT MEETING YOU IN REAL IS SCARY BECAUSE YOURE YOU AND IM A POTATO, LILLY
NAMASLAY!! ;) ;) This video is great!!!
QUALITY CONTENT SISTER!!!!!

I wish you would make more videos like this!! I loved this so much it warmed my heart to see raw unedited unscripted Lily just...ranting. I just aaaahh💙
I feel like you should rant more often lol. Feels so much like the old videos I love. :D <3
I've heard the jokes and the memes, but for real, my sister found a really great guy on Tinder, and we all love him, they're been together for one or two years now. Sometimes it works I guess. It's so easy to lie on these things, but it's surprising to hear that some people straight up don't care lol. Never tried these apps myself, and I'm not sure I ever will to be honest.
🤦🏾‍♀️ oh Lilly calm down😂😂😂  you’re overreacting over this... I guess it’s just being clueless about dating app that make you react like that😂😂😂 I’ll lol along with you
It feels like sitting and talking with you 💓
girl you sound like you snorted a line of coke with that beer
Seeeeee my friends need to see this video ,pushing me to go on tinder , girrrlllll i believe in fate ,and after your experience i think im good without tinder nd bumble 🤣🤣🤣 hilarious as always love you Lilly ❤❤ hope to meet you one day ❤ been here since 2013 watching you grow and inspire people ❤ much love ❤❤
dude this was how i felt. SO ACCURATE
I hate you lilly😑
i wanna see a new episodes of  parmjeet N manjeet.







EDIT: Actually i love you muaah
I couldn't stop smiling the entire video
I missed this 💜
#LoveYourself
Awesomeness! Just found your channel.
But like.....did you swipe right on anybody? 😂 I totally agree with all this tho 😂
Video is funny but why do I feel like she is sad underneath..her eyes look sad. I hope you are doing okay lily.. I love your videos 😘
Types of people on dating apps

2.liar


3.adventurous


4. Bad pictures 
i love u some much lilly
I loved this video!! I’m so glad you’re making content that you’re proud of, it really shows 👍🏽

Anyone else never used dating apps?
So I haven't watched your videos in a while but I love this style of no over editing just you with your camera being yourself, more of this ❤️
Imma take care of my mental health

Late night show host? 🤔

Unfunny?
Is you saw your friend on the dating app why did you hook them up someone that you know with help them out
“U using a horizontal picture on a vertical format AND U TRYNA GET A DATE??!?!?” Love that 😂🤣😂👌🏽 Love u lily ❤️❤️
People always say ‘don’t judge a book by its cover,’ but that’s literally all dating apps are 🤔
Omg this should this be a freaking series. Unedited rants from Lilly? About things we all think but never say? YES PLEASE!
Try dating apps in Washington DC another level of crazy. Lol
Where my Indian homies with the 'sapiosexual' tag at?!
I tried being on dating app, it didn't even last for a week! Don't know why? #foreveralone
Lilly you must have forgotten what is in the Combo 😂😂 😂 😉
Thanks for confirming i love your truth ... I sound exactly like how you when my friend tell me to do the same haha
This was some "2013 Lilly" 😂😂😂old school ranty👍🏼👌🏽🤩
I found my fiance at a dating app 😂🤷🏼‍♀️ until now I‘m not sure how. But it happend and I couldnt be happier about it ❤️
OLD LILYYYY!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE <3

“If I had a dollar for every... I would be richer than I currently am“
I’m gonna be able to say that one day
Dating apps .....you wanna live without them but.....these days it's hard to meet people. Uh....dating is hard
Lmao yasssdd Queen! We love an honest Queen 🤷🏻‍♀️
This would look awesome as an animated video 😂
Living for this more open Lilly. Just saying.
"So I can go home and text you from the safety of my couch."  🤣🤣🤣 can totally relate
I agree, no dating app for me. I prefer to communicate with someone face to face. Thank you for sharing your unedited video. I felt like I was talking with you while watching this video. Thanks again! :)
okay i absolutely LOVE how Lilly is JUST AS entertaining, without editing!!! she's definitely one of those genuine's that don't need editing to be funny i'm obsessed 💓
Love these vids
I've never used any dating apps, but I still don't trust them. I'd rather just stay single. 😄
Guess what........






Lilly is getting her own late night show! No joke, go watch Jimmy Fallon’s video!
😂I laughed all the way through
I don't think it's just me I  love the real talk. Way funnier and more relatable then anything anyone could possibly write.
Yesss <3 This is what I've been missing.. old school Lilly vibes. Love it. MORE PLEASE
🤦🏾‍♀️ You did the wrong apps girl. Lol try E harmony and Match.
Damn
That storytime actually gives me "Gabbie Show" vibes

She'll never make it on TV. I'll just bet. In fact, I'll prognosticate ....

I give her 3 months, which is generous.
"How to lie on dating aps" hahah sooo trueee 😂
Horizontal pic on a vertical platform and still expect to get a date.🤣
240p relationship 😂
I actually like this format for Lilly a lot!

Just go on rants ma! I’ve never tried a dating app tho’ 😅
VALIDATION haha!! Everything I feel about dating apps.
That is so accurate! Especially the part about seeing someone you know in real life on the apps! 😂 omg! So effing funny!
More of these rants PLEASE!!
I 💗 the change in which you now say "One love Lilly" rather than "One love Superwoman"
On the way to finding yourself....
PS: Love the video.
4:28 That seems like a good description of a man named Park Jimin
This was some real talk awesome sauce. Keep up all the hard work. Been here since the beginning and you have never let me down. Funny af always can count on you to make me smile. #yousavelives
You may have a little too much uncommon sense about the matter. 😂. I enjoyed the video and your hair looks luxurious.
Please do more of these less edited content this is what I subscribed to you for way back
super random but, is it just me missing her t-shirt references?
This channel is wow...
This is so accurate!! I thought I was the only one 😂😂😂
Omg you seem so drunk
Already I'm peeing  BAHAHAHA
"Say now I don't usually make videos like this..."
Oooooooo this is gonna be good!
(grabs a bowl of popcorn)
This might be my favourite video you’ve made ever. Please bring on more unedited rants that contain everything we are thinking but don’t want to say out loud LOLOL. I loved it so much.
8:46 : my teachers
😂😂😂😂😂 tooo true
That was wonderful. Please, please do more of this videos. They are exactly why so many people fell in love with you in the first place
Certified platinum!!!😵😁😁👌👍👌
I'm straight up gonna ask you posted a video back in November called my friends trying to get me laid and when you talked about never having used a dating app,you were wearing the same top.
Was this done on purpose or a happy accident?
AND THE AWARD FOR MOST HONEST PERSON GOES TOOOOOOOOO......
SUPERWOMAN!!!!!!!!!
Damn girl you said it all😂😂😂😂
I LOVE THIS VIDEO. tbh i stopped watching you cuz the recent scripted content wasnt funny to me. but LOL this is amazing !!! much love from toronto <3
Using a horizontal photo on a vertical platform! DO BETTER!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Im here pondering where is D-Trix, haven't even started to watch the video but the title got me slightly mad XD
240 P nobody has time for that 🤣🤣🤣
Lilly, I am sooo alone.....!!
LOVE this!!!! Go Superwoman 💕💕💕
Wow she really loves Trinidad and Tobago she even got her nails done in the flag that’s amazing
You need to rant more it was great
Congratulations on your NBC late night show!!!! I'm so happy for you!!!
Low res pics!!! Hahahah in 2019??...lazy!
Thanks for the dating advice Lily. I'll be sure to note this in my petty pad.
this is more about her coming out than it is about tinder. Don't be nervous, u still my top bae!
"it was a girl" 
Yes Lilly.YES!
I met my man on a dating app 🥰
wow, deeper human connection ...
Thanks for coming
Um, are you cheating? I need to take this up with the rock


Edit: OMG TYSM FOR ALL THE LIKES!!! ILYSM!!!

I agree with everyone loving this layout! I been here from the start and wow I loved that it was just you and the camera like old times xx
This is the first video I’ve watched in a while, and I loved it
OMG so true about the quality of the pictures. 😂
U want to use a horizontal picture on a vertical platform 😂😂😂😂
If you want to go on a dating app, try "spotted "
It works without photos 😊
I love this style of video!!! Keep doin' what you're doin' Lilly!
Okay this is my favorite type of content. WOW. I love you lol. We need more of this!! And congrats on the new show!!! We love you and can't wait to see you killing it on TV!!! <3
I love her but honestly this is kinda judgy
I would be richer than I currently am🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

NEVER BUT SERIOUSLY LILLY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
@0:50 
Takes ‘swig’ from bottle
doesn’t swallow
immediately opens mouth
Who else agrees that dating apps don’t work as well as meeting someone in person!!



Amazing vid Lilly!! You inspire me to work hard on my channel!! :)
i love this video! i know nothing about dating apps but this was such a genuine rant and i couldn't help but laugh when you laughed <3
We love a bi QUEEN
Girl we need more rants
I missed this sooo much
I love when Lilly makes unscripted videos and just talks freely as her authentic self. She has such a beautiful personality I hope she understands that she doesn't need to put on an act to produce good content.
Well, that's people's perspective how they want their profile to be or picture to be clicked, or what tattoos they want in their body! You're kind of being judgmental here. Well, when people points at you, you get upset! 
So, don't make people upset by letting them down by such rants.
I totally agree with you Lilly!!
Not gonna lie, I'm here for this organic content
this was fuckin hilarious,, thank you for this
The way you narrated it made it 10 times funnier 😂😂
So #relatable :D
No, seriously: I really liked that kind of video and I feel the same on dating apps :D
GURL!!! I keep tryin to tell my married friends how real the struggle is out here. Maybe they'll believe me after seeing this 😂😂
Coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool

Bumble=priyanka ad?😂
Jk
I'm so here for more of these unedited rants
Loved this omg😂😂😂😂
I really loved this authentic unedited rant video.
See 7:30 
It is true my friends came in my insta and one of my friends mom scolded me
Haha thaaaanks for the snapchat filter topic, damn :D
you neeeeed to try okCupid. hippie, adventurous, namaste overload. but the idea behind it is pretty cool.
I LOVE how casually you’re mentioning how you swipe left on WOMEN (because swiping right on these girls are tragic 😂) anyway, if this is you coming out. Welcome! We’ve been waiting. 🌈💕
“am I on postmate or tinder?”🤣🤣🤣
This is gold 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1 like = 1 heart for Superwoman
This unedited version, I love the most
I'm just here for the Trini flag nails! Yasss!!!
This is amazing 😂😻
Congrats on your new TV show 👏👏👏
The thing that made me really happy about this video is you openly telling about dating girls! GIRLLL LIVE YOUR TRUTH BC TEAM SUPER ALWAYS HERE 💕
Omg...I love this soo much!😂😂😂
Oh I feel you, used one app for a month-couldn’t take the nonsense so I deleted it. 😂😂
This gave me flashbacks to when my cousin came up on tinder! Threw my phone away also!
Oh my god this unedited video is sooo good it's feels so fresh aaah
LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! SO HILARIOUS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is probably my favourite video of yours
Lilly is drunk😂😂😂
Nama stay in bed..😂😂
REALLY LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! Feels so personal when you just sit down and have a chat with us ❤️
Great video 😂 I really liked it it was so nice to see you in this more natural way of filming 😘
THE OLD LILY IS BAAAAAAAACK!!!!!!!🎊🎉🔥🦄🎉💖
I love this style from Lilly 😩😩
Love this video! Reminds me of your rant video with t-shirt reference 😍 one of the reason I subscribed 😍 Bring back rant videos please 😁
"I'm  a sad embarrassed person and I want to be in this safe bubble of not real world "
I felt that
i missed this lily ❤️
Swipe me !!! I love you !!! Lol
She is for sure drunk !!
honestly i loved how you talked about the person being a girl, might not seem like a lot but it warmed my little also bi heart. also saying one love LILLY instead of superwoman, what a moment
This is so relatable 😅
I don’t think I’ve laughed harder from Lilly’s videos ever 😂 this was absolutely the best! A few of these mixed in with your normal skits would be amazing in the future 😂💓💖😍
I Tried Dating Apps for the First Time… (UNEDITED BUT SCRIPTED RANT)
😚😚😚😚😚😂😂😂😂😂😂gosh lilly. Love you so much u always make me crack up
Can you do a collab with jusreign? :) you’re so funny!!
OMG, Lilly, this is your best video ever!
No comment cause I'm 9 love u Lily ❤
Girl I would so date you if we were in the same state . Muahz
I love this video Lilly! Please do more like it pleaaaaaase. Love you 😍
The pasta is a 10 🤣🤣🤣
This was a great video that made me laugh like crazy 😂😂!! It felt more real & more authentic than anything in a long time
this is the kind of content i stan. tbh if you love your production videos, great. youtube has become such a personalized organic and interactive experience that this style of video-making is preferred.
Hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Enter: 500 thirsty people in the comments telling Lilly to just date them.



Including me. HA! Can't hate the dreamers.
Girlllll are you ok
I missed this 😂
I think that you should do a hair care routine video
Lilly you NEED to have a podcast this is perfect
Make this an actual unedited series
YOU NEED TO DO MORE OF THESE VIDEOS WE LOVE EM
LOLOL, 😂😂😂😂.  Way TOO true.
It wasss sooo funny and f* relevant omgg, I needed this today thanksss, love u from ketchup chips country :)
Hey lilly, theres probably no doubt in the world that you will see this but im doing a speech in class about how people care too much about what they look on the outside rather than actually being themselves and I'm going to mention you in it and your bool how to be a bawse and i was wondering did you ever struggle in school as i would love to include your struggle in life and how you became you. Xxx

   ~Emi xx
This took me back to the earlier Superwoman videos! Love it
Please repeat such videos 
They are so entertaining to watch !!!
Who else loves her positivity!!

She inspired me every day to work harder as a youtuber :)
Literally your personality is everything. You would think an unedited video would be really awkward but I enjoyed this just as much if not more than your regular videos 😊❤
i loved this damn video bro it reminds me of your old videos
Oh wow I had no idea that Lilly was open to dating women too! 
There’s a chance for me!
Imagine seeing Lilly on an app,being shook and swiping left on accident :').
Living in LA is a special type of nonsense on dating app 😂😂😂
Interests: aligning my chakras and deeper human connections
I love this style of vid
Ahh I love her! I love her so much! More power to you Lily!
Time of my LIFE with this ish lol. I tried it. Had the same thoughts- never downloaded again.
Lol"fineeeee I'll put my trial picture.. finneeeee"
🤣 Lily is probably one of the best youtubers. She has such a great personality
This is a really nice change of pace  to the sketches! I'd love to see these from time to time, if you felt like doing more of these again!
Picture taken on an Atari!!!😂
I honestly think lily would be such a great friend
Loving the nails tho🇹🇹🇹🇹
I found my husband on Tinder. Never would have met him otherwise. Don’t give up hope! :)
“DO BETTER!!” Lmao
😂😂😂Atari pictures
Did Lilly just come out? 😭💓
7:30 rip headphone users
Unedited rants are the best!!!! You gotta do more of these girl! ♥️
SAME. I cannot. WHEN I SAW MY FRIEND ON TINDER I SCREAMED AND DELETED MY ACCOUNT. I AM NOT HAVING THAT SHYET STEPPING UP TO MY FANTASY LIFE. NAH
Prolly they dont want colleagues/bosses/ partners find them ;)
The stories I could tell u... spill the tea gurl!😁🍸
Loved this video😍😂
This made me feel so nostalgic. All this video needed was the poster wall backdrop and it would been just like the older vids. Love it! Watching her rant was what got me watching her in the first place. OG Lilly!
The ending is crazy good 😂😂😂
Lilly's new tag #DoBetter
I feel the same way about dating apps!
I love this kind of format
i tried to use a dating app once and uninstalled it after 45 minutes
Your nail polish 🙌🙌🇹🇹🇹🇹
The last thing she said is so me😂
Honestly I was just looking at the popcorn machine at the back......😂....srry
More unedited rants !!!!
Loved this raw talking video of yours☺️
You’re awesome! ❤️
Brah I need more videos like this I love them
This video was hilarious😂😂😂
I say come thru with the T&T nails🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹😝😝😝😝😝😝😝
This made me miss shady moments
Loved it! So genuine
All I'm thinking about is that lucky guy that was in the right place at the right time to swipe right on Lily and get matched🙆🙆
Loved ittttt. Laughed watching you laugh omg
I love this video from you. You should do more like this
Girl, you're supposed to swipe right on your friends. Maybe it's just the people I know on Tinder.
I love this so much PLEASE DO MORE
Always AMAZING 😍🤗
Definitely go back to this style.  😍😘
MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS
MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS
FYI I dated a girl who aligned her chakras. That was back in high school! Also, in NY.
Girrrrl I feel you. Also I would LOVE to date you, but I happen to live in the tundra that is Michigan <3
TrinBago Massive🇹🇹
i love lilly just freely talking
Lily: Meet me in person
Stalkers: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Yeeeeaaah! The world needs this LGBT  representation, welcome to the valley. 😙😙😙😙
1. DID SHE SAY ONE LOVE LILLY AND NOT SUPERWOMAN!

2. Lilly calling out dating apps is actually hilarious!!!! 
OMGGGGGG!!! 😆❤️
Please do more videos like this. Felt like old times I smiled the entire video ❤️
Aw it's been a while since you've been unscripted and more 'real'❤
I never want to see another edited rant. Lilly. Lilly. Lilly. No more editing, thanks
Please make more unedited rants cause this was HILARIOUS!!!!
Hi Lilly!!! Ilysfm you are so inspiring and kind and loving 💓💓💓💓💓
oom tattoo .... not very Saskatchewan lol
Omg this was the bessst! So real.
Is it just me or did we all know that Lily never used a dating app 😂
I enjoyed this video! I don’t use dating apps (they scare me), so it was fun listening to someone use one for the first time. Also, I love hard ciders. They taste great! :)
You should make more unedited type videos; it's hilarious
I miss you Lilly 😗😘
Lilly, this is the first time in a while that I’ve laughed at one of your vids. I missed this you. 😂😂💕 unedited, unfiltered
“Low resolution pictures”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
An unedited rant series would be fantastic. I enjoyed this waaaaay too much!!
You're drunk lily
also, is this Lilly's secret coming out video
I totally can relate😂😂😂
IPhone10 into IPhone5....
You are so good....
This made me feel so much better about being single #foreveralone
Love the trini flag nails... lol
Sooo you think just because a person is adventurous and it means that he or she doesn't allowed to scroll on their phone and try some dating apps or have a dating life? I'm curious. Do you expect people who are ADVENTUROUS to be on top of the moutains 24/7 or go out kayaking 100 times per day and be like "Nope sorry what's a Tinder? I'm too busy being adventurous" 💁
Okay I'm loving this type of video Lilly
Just appreciating Lily for swiping for both teams. 🌈
At least now I know my crush on you isn't so irrational 😄🌈🌈🌈
LILLYYYY WHY CAN I RELATE😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
"You can do better" 😂
i loved this so much. You should make more like this.
This is the video that we all needed
I watched this with sheet mask on! And it's all over my feet now xD
Well, i'm not on Tinder or any of those apps, but you can sure hit me up anytime, I quite love your personality... and your judgement on the dating apps, so spot on. That's why I never used them myself.
This video is fire. You should do more unedited videos!
I am NEVER doing that again

Lololololololololol when you break down and do, we all would love to see more of this XD
Lily on tinder: sees someone she knows ignores it
Me on tinder: sees someone I know print it and send it to the person so we laugh together
I'd date you but I'm too shy. Rip
We stan a queen! 💛
This was amazing!
LMAO THIS WAS HILARIOUS
Best video of yours in centuries ♥ Please moar~
Please make this a series!
Dating apps are the bane of my existence. 😈
Oh ! Seems like she was swiping for girls. 🤔
I loved it😂😂
I don’t care that you lied but I still love youuuuuuuuuuu ;^;
If I wasn't in Brazil I would totally approach you rs I mean respectfully 😅
Never clicked so fast, missed your videos but keep up what you’ve been doing

HELLO, I am on this dating app because I'M SAD AND A EMBARRASS PERSON. 
Genuinely mood for life.
22 years of sadness and embarrassment !
I love how this is unedited but still very entertaining and not even a bit awkward
I do enjoy some Lilly Rant !! hehehe ... good luck on your dating path! it is a jungle out there!
Do more unedited rants
Where’s the next meet and greet so I can give you my number in person? Thank you for blessing the internet with this rant. Honestly could listen all day
The rant I never knew I needed 😂🤣. I can't do dating apps either for all these reasons. Don't worry babe, we'll meet soon 😗.
Damn I’m almost offended by the ohm thing bc I truly study that stuff and love the ancient meanings not just the trend of hipster new age bs lol
On point 👌🏻😂🤣
I LOVE THIS OMG
please stop trying so hard, its like the same fake show every time in all your videos making all these fake jokes trying so hard. JUST BE YOURSELF LIKE HOW OYU USE TO BE, that was the best
Could help but noticing the pop corn maker in the background with "pipoca" written on it. Like, why is that in portuguese? XD
🤣🤣 yeah!!! approach and give me your number,then we see how it’s go..hehehe..l am 40,but still not trust the dating app also. Damm,i very the OG 😉

One of my ex’s good friends liked me on tinder and I literally laughed out loud and yelled NOPE
Congratulations on the huge gig!!!  Reppin' Scarborough on late night tv
Lilly is 4K she ain’t got time for 240p
That was great!!!!
R.I.P. earphone users
Wow she finnaly does a rant after 2 years
“Imma have this hard cider coz I like that hard” 😂😂
Loved it!! love you!!
I love this video. The unedited lily. It’s funny and real ❤️
lilly literally just described every teenage girl i meet on a daily basis. i love it.
"I took one sip of a beer and your girl acting up..."
I thought you said that was a hard cider?
Lilly looks so much happier now that she can upload whenever she wants💕
Girl I love this side of you ... Please make more video like these ♥️♥️♥️♥️ and girl SOOOO relatable
Lilly pretty much nailed every reason why I AVOID dating apps!
horizontal picture on a vertical platform? lmfaooooo I-

AHAHAHAHHA THIS MADE MY DAY!!!
Yeah I feel the same about the low resolution photos. Like what the heck is 2019, did you take that photo with a Siemens 😂
Lilly doing non scripted rant is my new favorite thing 😂❤️
7:29 RIP earphone users
Your channel is dying
You took one sip and sound drunk
OMG. Good for you Lilly.  So happy u decided to make a video like this

eHarmony was my lucky bet. Met a great lady. ☺️

Bish, this def should be a series! You were so "loose" and not worried about time, I liked
So hold on hold on you were checking out girls on tinder and bumble
Trinidad flag on your nails - represent :) This makes me like you more. Thanks for loving my country
I wonder how many pills this girl is on
This was raw and bomb!
Unedited and still funny and awesome. 😀

Super cringey.
RIP headphone users at 7:35! 😂😱😣
One line haha second line double haha and so it goes on

When they say 'adventurous'... I think they mean 'in the bedroom'...
my phone number: +48 504 113 110 ;)
Make a reaction video by your parents on b*tch lasagna
Living for adventurous
I think it’s just me but I never heard of Bumble
She is so much out of touch from reality :(
Was this a coming out vid boo :'D
Wait... Lilly's bi?
Is Lily bi because you have to set up interest in women to see other girl's profiles to get matched
I these types of vids
Love your nails 😁
Lilly can I have your number if that's fine with you
That 'adventurous' point crack me so hard. xD
Yes we tired on the dating site
I thought this said I tried dating apples
Try DilMil! ❤
u are SO DRUNK
I hear you... and let's meet👀
Yo at 0:50 u start laughing out of no where and look drunk
I like this content🇿🇦💓

I actually found my soulmate on tinder😂❤❤❤
Lily, expose them
This is hilarious! <3
She sounds so drunk 😄 I'm so happy she's back to these amazing old videos
She looks as beautiful as ever, and I swear that everyday she's getting better..💕🍁


 
This rant would have also worked 10 years ago.
LOL, just tried it for the first time 2 months ago & it's seriously is funny. There was a guy from prison on the dating app. One guy unmatched me b/c he found out I used to live near him & knew his residential radius. Like was he hiding something, afraid I might know his wife or gf and snitch him out?   lol   :)
You gotta do more of it. This reminds me of the superwoman of the past!
Felt like i was watching asksuperwomanlive😂...rip
Congratulations!!!! I can't wait to watch A Little Late!!!!!!!!
Congrats on your new TV gig.  We finally have a female late night talk show host.  Can't wait till September.
I am those kinda person who cannot concentrate on anything unless Lily pick up the beer bottle cap that she dropped.
666k veiws
"Their is"
What a coincidence, i tried dating apps at the same as hers
Where’s all my  single galls ? 💖 who needs men anyways
GURL SAME
Calous and seriously unfunny. 
Too little basic compassion. 😔
Disappointed.
I feel personally attacked 😂😭
This type of videos are so cool, really love it!
the opening card
Good luck on A Little Late
absolutely loved this sit down video,  really chill vibes
Honestly I love this version of you. Just you ranting about life things. Completely relatable
Watching after Lilly’s talk show announcement? I’m so proud of our superwomannnnn 😆
This is throwback to the old Lilly videos and I LOOOVEEEE IT. please do these kinds of videos more!!!!
So are you checking girls out on Tinder?
Lol now I wish I was in LA so I could meet Lilly!
I can tell she’s way more open now, i love it!
2 minutes into this video and I’m DYING already 😂😂😂😂
You sould'nt drink alcool on front of your young audience ... I loved the video anyway
I laughed so hard watching this😂
I love your Trinidad nails!!!!
More rants please!!!!!!! :D
More videos like this!! I loved it
Love this! I met my girlfriend on tinder and had to weed through ALOT of basic white girls and snap chat filters! 
Be proud girl! Proud of who you find attractive and how you meet them!!

Good luck! 😂
Love this!!!!
Do more like this
now that you tried dating apps, do a video about types of people on dating apps
Missed you !

I need more vds like this in my life.
Did she say “1 ♥️ Lilly that is a wrap” 
Is that the thing now. I’m a late.
i loved this vid lol
missed these kinds of videos
Ok not gonna lie was feeling a lot of distance as a fan bc I haven't been into your recent vids lately but this brought me back <3
This was the best video I watched all week to be honest
So lilly was on tinder swiping on girls !!!
Did you shift the pipoca machine for the aesthetics of it? I love you!!💓💓💓
Man, I miss her old introduction "hey, what's up? Its superwoman"
You're getting desperate like the rest of us 😂 lol jk
Lilly Singh speaking of the low quality don’t u mean android I mean yeah 😂😂
I saw this coming from the title; the photos, the guys(well, I know girls do it too), the creepiness, the stupidity.
this was adorable! do morrreee
This video is spot on
This was hilarious. I'd like to see more unedited rants.
Love this!
Hahaha “aligning my chakras”
We stan angry orchards.
This is just so entertaining my god I love it

lol, enjoyed this video :)
Could you pls make your parents react to bury a friend
This was lovely...felt so personal and intimate! 😊😊😊

I had a good laugh. Thank you, Lilly! This was different but in the best way :)
Love this!
This was honestly so entertaining to watch😂😂
Does she have the trini flag for nails <3
I felt i was in her vlog segment ,tho.
i totally agree
I love this video! It reminds me of your "Shady Moments" videos from eons ago. Dating apps are the worst! I tried to use them my first semester of college and ended up talking to some weirdos. Real life is the way to go, because hello, pizza is in real life. Forget meeting people in bars, go hangout at a pizza place or a buffet to meet someone 👌🏻
I love the uncut stuff
More videos like these pleaseeeeeee!!
Lolololol I can feel how awkward dating apps were for you and I can soooo relate
All I saw were the nails.... Trini posse stand up!🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹
GUYSS LILLY IS HAVING HER OWN SHOW ON NBC AWWW I'M SO HAPPY FOR HER 😭
This was great I could feel all the places that needed to be cut but honestly I loved this so much
UNCUT LILLY >
Okay this is a work of art

“The pasta is a ten but what is you” 😂😂😂
*sip*
I’m gonna be honest and tell you that if you give up your current content and start uploading videos like this WE ALL GONNA LIKE IT SO MUCH MORE
Honestly you need to do more unedited rants! It’s so funny!
I really like your honesty and humor during your rants. If you made these unedited videos a series I would totally watch them.
You were really drunk
I love this!
Do parents react to please me by cardi b and bruno mars
OK its not that funny
This was mad funny you should do more uncut rants like this
I got a tinder ad on this video lol
alraight imma meet u and give u my number☺️❤️😏

Pls make more videos like this please!
I literally just came back from school!!!!

Can you collab with tpindell?

Drunk? Hight on pot?
One of my favs so far !!
Yeah, Lily. I never actually use a dating app. I don't trust men very much, especially online. But your videos always make me laugh! Like a friend I don't have.

Loveeeeeeee you... <3
I wanna see her yell at hr cute lil dog more

I’ve been waiting to watch your video today and that’s definitely worth it a try, you’re just amazing with no edits 
And I like how you yelled your dog’s name in the end it’s so funny 😂😂😂😂
Love your videos sooooooooooooooooooo much
I relate so hard to this foray into dating apps ahahaha my first time was in December. Lasted only a week on tinder. Tried hinge but got tired of that tooo lol
No music and no stopping. I thought this was gonna be a vlog at first.
The fake laugh is so cringy. Well, I got to see the fake lifeline accent atleast.
Yard sales are adventurous 😂😂😂
So its good to know ur finally gonna start dating
What's wrong with being adventurous... It's just one of characteristics ... If they love it so be it... If they mention it... It's their choice u cannot make fun of others who may not be having same characteristics as you possess
I swear to
Yay bisexuals!
Oh my gosh I laughed so hard
Looove the Trini nails Lilly
Omg i didnt even realise this was her main
that scream burst my ears
dude this format is sick
LILLLLL LATEEEE
Lol facts!!
OMG! I can totally relate. It's a whole new another world on tinder! Very creepy place.
So good Lily
And I acc laughed
I honestly love how changed a little bit its kinda interesting
She finally seems to come out of the closet.
Love this
If you see this your awesome and life will treat you with the best. I want to make it on YouTube and I would really appreciate any support 🙏God Bless🙏❤️
This is sooooooooooooooooooooo relatable 😂😂😂
This is the most entertaining video of yours I've watching in a while, and I've been around for a while, butchea. Lily I just loved it. Please make more rant video's xxx
This was refreshing. It was fun to see your honest first impression of such a popular social tool/thing
I mean, I never would want to use someone for money. Or take advantange of their kindness. I always trusted women more.
STOP SWEARING, GIRL...!!!!
At least we know Lilly's still single😂
this is so fun lmao
OMG, you are too funny.
Can't stop thinking about that you were also swiping on girls 😏
FAKE ::::.... That 'Bacardi' bottle is NOT beer. FAIL. Please respect stage props.
Gurrl, I've laughed so much throughout this video I am now crying😂 please please PLEASE do more laid back videos like this! literally so hilarious! I love you so much!
Has she come out on youtube yet? 
Also, this gives a lot of old video vibes. A rant lmao
Would've dropped my number so you text me from the comfort of your bubble and get to know me but I have a gf.
I think she’s drunk
Why do I like this kinda format more than everything else she's ever done?
Your nails are da bomb
She has two channels or what❓
Looool you are just funny in general do whatever video you like
I think I'm spontaneously just liking her videos at this point, idk how it happens
I love your vids
love this
Have you painted the Norwegian flag on your nails? Cause if so, awesome!
Hey Lily! Can your next vid be types of kids at recess!
Who here is a Canadian?
Please make more rant videos
First Lilly Singh video I have liked in years. Good job!
LOVED this
At least the ending was funny, ...wait? How did I lasted to the end?
I love these unedited rants
I'd be super cool if u made a series of of this!
9:17 “ * what is you? * “
I LOVED THIS
Soo funny love it😂😂
Why she salty bout dating apps lololol
Is she okayy?lol
I missed you
Drunk rant series !! Please
8:35 😂
Hey Lilly, can i have your number?
Never been on a dating app. Videos on YouTube like True Crime Daily keeps me away from it tbh...
I absolutely love the unedited video!!!! Like it makes me so happy to just listen to you rant
Kween said unfiltered and she delivered okaaaaaaayyyyy
Amen!!
Is no one gonna talk about how she doesn’t even hole the bottle right when she’s drinking it? Idk why but it irks me so god damn much lmao
Nama slayyyy 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Congrats on coming out as bi, btw💗💜💙 I’m a fellow bi, and when I realised my bisexuality it felt just right. At first I found it difficult to talk about girls in the way that I talk about boys, but after a few months, I’m becoming more and more comfortable with my identity! I hope you’re comfortable with your identity ((:
I like this format!! It’s fun to see you have fun
No a microwave
Oh lolly Songh !!! You make me laugh this is so funny!! X
You should do parents react to please me ft cardi b
U know when u just finishing eating a freshly picked  fruit or vegetable that's how I felt after watching this video 😊
Cheers 🍻
Uh brb ima just go download these dating apps so I can date Lilly...oh never mind let me just find out her address so I can say hi in real life and give her my number cause i'm a #BAWSE like that😌 lol 😂 (that ish only be happening in my dreams lets be real)
This video X 10= Dating apps in India. 😂😂
I’m not kidding.
Um... I feel worried watching this...
I miss these videos!!!! I mean, your current content is awesome, but this feels so close... I love it :)
😂😂😂😂💀
Does girls get drunk
I wish I could date you Lilly Singh you are very special.
I actually really like this format of rants fr fr. I couldn’t stop laughing and this is probably my favorite rant of yours honestly. You’re a very funny person naturally and editing that kinda ruins the vibe (if you even get what I mean lmao). I’m just saying that unedited rants really brings out the best of your comedic genius 😌👏🏻
Hey lilly ...will you date me?
5:55 did she just come out?
seeing you laugh is the best haha "we are out here" haha such a good clip!
This is so goooood
kinda feeel like you could‘ve went on forever that’s what it makes so so hilariously true
7:31 jungshook?
I likes this so much.... didn t watch your content for a while.. but this I like a lot😁😁😁 thank you
Wow did you really do that? Thanks for sharing.
Can’t wait to meet you in person ;) jokes aside still think you the best!
YO iiSuperwomanii !! Oka LILLY SINGH!!! YOU HAVE TO COLLAB WITH TPINDELL I THINK YALL COUKD MAKE SOME DOPE AND HILARIOUS VIDOES!
Cringing about the number of times I said adventure in my app bios. Ugh.
LOOOL this is why I rather find someone in person
I'm so done😂😂😂😂
started laughing as soon as i saw the title to this video
i haven’t got any of ur notifications wtf
We need more unedited stream of thought type videos!
Me and my friend found one of our teachers on a dating app.
I miss Lilly like this. First video I've watched in a while. Much prefer her this way than the over produced stuff she puts out. It just feels like we've lost connection with her. More of this please
Superwoman acting crazy for 10 mins straight...
Y you lookin at gals?
LILLY wth!! I literally downloaded tinder last night lol
Hey, anyone any the wiser on what an "om" "ohm" I have no idea how it's spelled, tattoo?
I was dying to see your new video 😁😁😁
OMG I have never done this been with my partner for 19 years now so we met the old school way. But it has become very popular. So hilarious, but yeah its pretty much superficial. So interesting the way dating has evolved.  I am with you if you its only based on pictures take the time and upload a nice/normal one at least.
Immediately Googles: How to I meet Lilly Singh in person?
Please make more videos like this, this was so fun
I am the first comment, can't say anything about the views. The videos she puts up are sooo fun and awesome. I wish she was my friend, we would rock
That was awesome. Thanks.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
DAAAAAMMMMNN there goes my chances! LMAO Waited all this time for you to come out and only looking in LA
Wow you’re so funny 😆
This was so fresh! I've been avoiding Lilys videos for like a year already, cause they stopped being relatable to me... but THIS, oh girl this was just so "i need more of this" sort of content.
Its 3.00 am and I have school tomorrow wtf am I doing?
I had tinder for 2 weeks but deleted it cuz I got cancelled on 3 times in like 5 days so...yeah😂
My name is om 😂😂😂
Lol yeah Tinder isn't the app for me either!!
You are so cute
7:35 They didn’t enter your fake world.... you entered theirs because they were there first...
999 people disliked wow that's a lot of salty people
God I loved raw unedited Lilly drinking cider and talking to you like a buddy.
I WAS LAUGHINF SO FUCKIMF HARD IN MY HOTEL ROOM AND MY PARENTS LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS CRAZY
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😂😂 I CLICKED SO FAST AND IM SO HAPPY I DID WHO ELSE DID?
This gal doesn't need dating apps. She gets enough action the 'ole fashioned way. ;)
Best way to describe this video is "Famous rich person tries being poor for the first time."    Also somebody gotta explain what adventurous means in dating apps to her.
I feel like the first minutes she was like "I gotta make a video in case anyone saw me in these apps. I need to explain my self"
scrolls through tinder to find Lilly
Can't everything be from the safety of ones couch...
I think if I were to title a book about my life it would be using a “horizontal picture on a vertical platform.” Lol. I don’t know why that resonated the way it did, but I loved that sentence. Congrats on the new show!
So much like the old times! I’m living for it!❤️
This video reminded me of me when I first started using dating apps two months ago. I thought some of the stuff people wrote were hilarious! Try using match and hopefully you will have better luck finding your partner in life!
Bro KSI LOVES u
wow that is the kind of content i used do love when i subed back in 2013 phew i need more of that again
Why is no one in the comments talking about how this is the best coming out video ever?
S&K....
If you love superwoman give this comment a thumbs up ❤❤❤
It's hard for a ghost out here... what horror characters would you wanna see if I made a pt. 2? xo
This is the quality content I signed up for
Imagine if the ghosts actually had girl talk like at 3:00
"Google map says he's 10 minutes away. What takes you 45 minutes to get home?  You got someone else scaring you? " - Lmao 😂
“What is with the assumption that I’m Christian?” Me asf
I just realized she meant GHOUgling, not googling, and GHOUgle maps... or maybe not.


I'll walk myself out.
I tried nose bleeding every time I wanted to get out of having a presentation, but I’ve never tried mouth full of bees!
“Im waiting in the tub”
“Prune fingers”
“Under the bed”
“So dusty”
😂😂😂
They always ask, who are you?
But they never ask, how are you.
That jump scare tho 😂 it got me laughing so hard
"Banshee Sharma" 😂 died already at 0:20
When ghost is drunk and hanging out with friends 😂😂omg I can't stop laughing 😂😂
4:37 I hate the fact that actually sacred the heck out of me
The blood in the alcohol glasses was hilarious lol
I felt really sad for ghosts😞😞...next time I'll try to be their friend😃
such an adorable ghost. I would be honored if I was killed by her.
now I am going to pretend to walk away

JK HERE I AM
3:47 "take this holy water"😂!.
YES! Just like old times! Those effects though, :D <3
Way better than the past few videos. Quality over quantity is the way to go for YouTube videos in my opinion. :D:D
Wow I paused right at 0:29 and was not disappointed lol u got my like 👍😂
Can u make a video about if cavemen had social media
"Can you maybe do it again but PG 13" then hes like "lets just say that the ghost is drunk"
lmao ahah love you lily

Now I realize why this is the best channel ever!
I love the new content, go girl :)
Make manjeet and paramjeet dress up as you, Lilly. It would be hilarious.
You can definitely see that she's putting way more effort in videos, especially the editing. Gotta appreciate that

* proceeds to like own comment *
This is why I pay for my Internet.
Okay, I admit, I'm one of the people who didn't really get Lilly's videos anymore, but still continued to support her as a person, and still loved her vlog channel. But this video just reminded me of her older videos that I used to love and watch over and over again. 💕💕
You always make me snort and laugh.
Thank you for cheering me up and making me feel better.
i stopped watching youtubers that i used to watch for about 5 months and then your video popped up on my recommends and i regret not watching 😂 but also, i’m happy cause i get to binge
"what is with the assumption that i am Christian"😂😂😂
FINALLY!! Lilly, it’s been so long since you’ve posted a video. Thank you. This made me smile. Great vid. I look forward to your next videos.

Then I saw this and damn, you've really substituted quantity for quality

To be honest I’m such a scaredy cat that the last “jump scare” ACTUALLY SCARED ME 😂 😂😂😂😂
I ain’t afraid of no ghosts. Who ya gonna call? Ghostbusters
Oh, so you're NOT gonna marry me?
I started laughing so hard when she went "I turned my head 360 decreases" 🤣🤣🤣

#mandelaeffect #conspiracy

The hangout with friends abd that jumpscare had me lying on the floor laughing 😂😂
Lily I know this has NOTHING to do with this video but can your parents react to BTS DNA or Idol? 

Thanks 💕
1:42 to 2:27
Why is this so true?
This is literally the best I love u
Break is over?
3:49 lol that reminded me of Supernatural when Lucifer goes down to see an exorcism and the two priests started shouting "THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELLES YOU!" While splashing holy water on him and Luci's like, "relax!" While wiping off the holy water from the side of his nose with his thumb 😂
yo?  u all are ghost welcome in my house... get it?😂😂

Do any other small YouTubers always get inspired to film after watching Lilly? Because ME!
i never understand...if theres a ghost in your house, theres someone to call

GHOST BUSTERS
"Oh so you're not gonna marry me?" I love her 😂😂❤️❤️
I guess Lilly was bloody mary
That was brilliant. This and your arranged marriage video are my favs.
This is really funny, especially because I had an audition yesterday and I am finding out the part tomorrow!! I freaked out and you are asking for more to do!!😂😂 Love from England ♥♥
Edit: I got into the show but only the chorus but I am still happy

Amazing vid!! You guys ignore my content and channel :)
This is why I subscribed.
Lilly, your makeup is INSANE! The only monster/ghost I didn't recognize was the "Bride-to-be" girl, was she from something specific?
Also could part 2 involve werewolves? I love werewolves
To me this is the best video of Lilly  😊😊
How do you come up with all these wierd but intersting topics for the vidio
Hey Lily, great to hear there is another Bi youtuber. Welcome to the club. XD

i got Lilly's Pantene advertisement before the start if the video!! never skipping that
I'm fine reminds me of BTS ..!!
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO I'VE EVER SEEN! By Lilly!!!
My old Lilly is back ..
Shes Legit not Caring.
Her personality is out of this world! In a good way haha. She’s inspired me to make my own videos too!
This was hilarious af! 🤣 #vlogfam #Teamsupertoronto 🇨🇦
This video is a blessing🤣🤣🤣
The post-edit is strong with this one. ❤️
This is by far one of my most favourite creative videos from you!! KEEP UP WITH THE ORIGINALITY YAAAAS
Loved it when she was pointing out all of the horror cliches! ❤👍
The actress she shook hands with, at the end of the video... all I'm gunna say.
I literally was laughing a lot, same thing I say when i watch horror movies  how the bad guys catch up so quickly. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please I beg make pt 2 !!!!!!

I’m not going to lie, I am obsessed with this video and I’m SOOO proud of it. Thank you so much for watching and allowing my brain baby to be part of your day. Hope you enjoyed it!!  What was your favourite part? Comment below fam x
Press read more




Your 2019 is going to be good for you



Like to clarify
This chick wearing a ferrari jacket while having a lambo in the video 😂
Smh. 🤦‍♂️ I hate that her real formula actually is accurate....
Even madder at the fact that I like this song...
She is throwing paper towels as money 🤣 💵
And also extremely disheartening that this is really hip-hop now.....😭😭😭
Girl you just wore a ferrari shirt in front of a lambo
I got a feeling this is how mumble rappers actually record songs
I was laughing at her throughout the video. Then when she finished the rap I was like WOW it was surprisingly good. You Nailed It Girl. Am a SUPER FAN all the way from Ghana
My favorite is the “a,e,i,o,u are vowels” line. The was awesome!
Not gonna lie, I spent like 10 minutes on Spotify looking for this song.
If migos watches this...






DROP SPLASH BANANA
Drop splash banana sounds hard than most of these rappers 😂🤦‍♂️🏿
Duuuuude!!! Showing love all the way from South Africa "AK47 KA-BLAMA"
No offense but I ain't gon' lie tho, I don't mean you're not talented or any kind of that, but what I'm saying is these days it doesn't need much talent to make Rap songs and that's sad. Our Hip Hop Days were Gone, those realist MCs were gone but only few are here with us, uhh,, miss those good ol days.
Me and my cousins were very inspired by your video. We decided to create our own migos songs and videos lol This was so fun and cracks me up every time. We followed ur instructions and we made sons called Cool Crop Top Box, Kicks dude with the hairspray,and Cat Beach Squad thanks for the idea and we love u lilly❤️❤️❤️
Lol this could actually become a legit bop XD
I think you have a future as a ghost writer. As good or better than 70% of the songs that are currently getting airplay.
Wig: snatched

U need to be a rapper 😂
The FIRE rap starts at 4:06...

Drop drop drop drop
Drop all the tops
Won’t stop ’til I’m caught
Hop on a mop
Make it drip like some snot
I brought what they taught me SKRT
Bought a top from a shop SKRT SKRT
Drop like the temperature
Drop like a ride
Drop is a word that’s opposite to rise
She calling me pops, I say stop just drop
Booty go clack like some wet flip flops
Clack clack clack
Her booty don’t stop
Call booty siri, she a robot

Dolphins man they go splash you know
Shark week make you go splash you know
Pill pill pill now we passing out
Lash on a bash gave me rash now we cashing out
My car go splash give you whiplash
Got a new tat on my back, it’s a cat
Meow meow meow kitty go meow
Spill a drink, use paper towel
Drip too hard, use a paper towel
A E I O U are vowels
Fast with the splash like dash
Punctuation
All back in a hat you pass
Graduation
First we drop
Then we go splash
Lock like a knot
Mass on some bass

Gimme that potassium damn
Gimme that potassium man
Dance with my dogs in the night time
With 12 bananas in my hand
Looking ripe dawg
Looking just right
You understanda
My banana is a can a WHOOP WHOOP
Ain’t no one minute man ah
Deal with twins like Danny Tanner
Banana bandana AK 47 ka-blama
Peel it ’til the tip tip
Mario Kart slip slip
Ain’t no apple, ain’t no pear
Hair with a fair teddy bear did a dare

Drop splash banana (x6)
LS as Migos 
I put it down like a hammer

(This took me so long lol)
What is up with these parody joke Songs being actually kinda good? First nigahiga’s honey disstrack and now this... move away radiohead, my iTunes library has been taken over by YouTube comedians. 
Great work👏👏
This is fire, actually sounds like something the Migos would do, plus, I love the visuals, the editor is awesome
Nailed it!
Migoa has left the chat......

I can't watch to the end... Damn
We watched this in school...
Drop,splash,banana sounds like 3 different migo songs
Wow i got a skincare commercial just before the video
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t try washing my face like in the commercials.
Olay is the only moisturizer I will ever use because my grandmother has used it for decades and she looks AMAZING
"I think I can parallel park, but I can't and people are honking." 
....Me.
When she said she was thirty years old, I was like girl you tripping but home girl is ACTUALLY 30 YEARS OLD 😩
It feels like only yesterday that I watched the first superwoman video
Keep thriving sis
Did I just watch a 3:22 minute ad and enjoy it?
OMGOMGOGMOGMOGMGOMGOMGOGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG PPL GEUSS WHAT  FOUND OUT TODAY!!!
Heyy lily, so my English teacher today was telling us about one of her friends who she went to elementary school and university with. and she said that she got so famous and rich, but spent her money for good things like helping ppl around the world. and then someone asked her who this person was and she said it was YOU!!!! LIKE OMGOGMOGMGOMG she said u went to York University with her in Toronto. do u remember her? Nasreen Khan is her name.  and i still cant believe that my FAVORITE teacher was friends with one of my FAVORITE youtubers!!!!!! like im freaking out rn!!!!!
We WILLINGLY wasted our time to watch an ad..
But it’s lily sO WE dOnT cARe
I grew out of your videos because they didn’t seem funny anymore. But this video is hilarious 😂 I subscribed again.
I just watched a 3:01 ad and enjoyed it😮
Lily’s 30??? My brain still associates her as younger and thinks that she’s like 22 lmao 😅😅
Hi Lily, you probably get thousands of these comments a day and you don't want to hear it again but I'm going to say it, I have been going through major depression lately with internet trolls and I just wanted to give a major thank you for helping me through everything from body issues to people calling me a thot. you always make me smile every time I watch your videos. so





thank you.
"Side salad hold the lettuce" 💀💀
You're 30 years old!!?? Im sorry but I thought you were like 18 or something.. or about maybe 20... just that I figured you were ar least ten years younger than you actually are
I LOVE THIS!
Now that's a skin care commercial
Who else thinks that Lilly looks FIRE in the thumbnail 🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥
I actually thought u were like 23 or something.
this is my second favorite ad ever!








the first is the old Tostitos ads with the crazy Mexican family that lives in the soap opera, like with the shirtless guy, the to rich4u mom, the dad, the hot chic that's probably named Sofia or Alehandra and extras.
"Bad Life Choices"
I Feel You.
This is probably the best #ad I've seen on YouTube! You put the rest of us to shame! 😂
Um... Her skin is perfect. Why did she make this video?
The only people I see who have perfect skin are k-pop idols
Did I just willingly watch an ad
You are the most talented girl I’ve ever seen!!! Go girl...I love you.
Only Lily can make an ad actually useful , relatable as well as funny at the same time. ❤
That's how you do a commercial
"When my ex got married...to my best friend" 
I couldn't stop laughing!
Damn, that hair flip
She...she said "one love, LILLY, that is a wrap and zoop!" I'm so proud of her ♥️
If all ads were like this, I’d never skip them. 🤷‍♀️
ME after drinking one bottle of water😂🙋🏼‍♂️
Ok this needs to be on my TV right NOW!! Forget about all those other ones! Love you Lilly!!🔥💋
The end is the best “sorry I thought I could do it”.
The microbeads part just killed me 😂😂
I can see an improvement in content already! This is really good “ at least you’ll have nice skin “😂
Olay 
At least you’ll
Have nice skin
Her hair is so long, I wish my hair was that long, it's so pretty.....
This was so real and relatable. And  I'm a 27 y-o guy.
“One love supe- HUH? Oh yeah Lilllllyyy” replays it just so I can get it right
"I'm sorry, I thought I could do it!"
HA! Me.
Ikr like who tf splashes water on their face like that??😂😂😭
How about I tell u over dinner.
Brunch.
Coffee.
Face time.
I'm easy.
Ok. 
-Me 🤣
Yo, this is so different form all the other vids and I gotta say I love it! It's so cool!
Legit there was a skincare commercial right before the vid and idk I just thought it was ironic
"Side salad hold the lettuce" 😂😂😂
Can you find a period product partner next? I'd love to see that as a realistic commercial!
Parallel parking! 😂
Ders vater oll over de floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I LOVE the indian mum so much!!!!
Thank you for a real commercial!
Love this! Those skin care commercials have always confused me! 🤩🤪
I actually agree I used Olay facials before this vid and my skin is on POINT👍😘😍
Why is this the most accurate thing I’ve ever seen in my life hahaha
"I'm in Ohio..."
Me: is actually in Ohio Okay then XD
“When my ex got married , to my best friend “
I saw one just before and in the middle of the id       






LOL

Best add ever!! Side salad hold the lettuce.. I'm done 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
I love this vid it is so true and funny 😄
Compared to most of her videos, I genuinely enjoy the simplicity of this. I love her parodies, but this will always be an all-time favorite!
Lily’s crew: Hilarious! They are gonna love this!!!
Lily leaves the room
Lily’s crew: Run away while you can 😰
She's 30!! Girl you look like you 20👍 Long live superwoman
When im upset you are the one youtuber i want to watch, i am so happy that i discoverd your channel at 500k! I love you so much!❤️
I’m getting a sense Lily wants to show how much she loves Olay! She is also flexing on how many products she has
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You just got clickbaited
But for a good reason too
I was ACTUALLY sold by this add lol GREAT job
This video is hilarious, its amazing. I love it!!!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Now this is a Commercial ........
😂✌
This is the best ad that was ever created.  1:38 makes me laugh so hard every time 😂
{\_/}
( -.-)
/ >🍿

Very entertaining ❤️
Any chance of a  My Parents React to Sickick - Roll Thru video?^^
This AMAZING!Love you Lilly😙
THIS WAS GREAT HAHA i actually loved how this was really well put together and it flowed very smoothly! no awkwardness at all 😂😂

Olay is my favourite ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lmao I got a commercial before watching this vid😂
I literally got an ad for curology featuring the world record egg 😂💀
A skin care commercial played right before this video lol
Pimples have left the chat

Edit:WOW thanks for all the likes!
"What happens in Ohio stays in Ohio" 😂😂😂
I love you gurl❤️❤️
YAASS!!! 1 point OHIO!!!❤️❤️❤️💃💃
LMAO!!!!! Right before watching the video i got a skincare ad!!!!
Thank you Lily you’re da realist!!!
Did Lilly just say she is 30. She looks 20-25 with no joke.
Ahhaaaa! I love when the mother came in during the water splashing scene ^ ^
This is the most realistic ad ive ever watched
the way she just shoved aside that scientist😂
Ironically I got a skincare commercial right when I clicked on this 😂
Is this video sponsored? Just curious Btw just realised that she said it was sponsored. Maybe i should start seeing the hole video before commenting
I got a skin care commercail before watching this 😂😂
I got "Neutragena" ad right before this.
Lilly deserves more views 😓😓❤
Best ad😍I have ever seen on YouTube
I would love to watch this before every single YouTube video I watch instead of all the other ones😝 right guys?!
stop talking about your amazing product...here's olays awesome product 
lol
What the frig? Ur 30? Geezus you don’t look a day over 22!!! 
U go gurl! 

Ur beautiful, Lily! ❤️
I literally  just saw a skin care commercial before this vid.

Why can’t adds be this cool 😂😂
Watch f the prom on Netflix Lilly is the teacher in it!




Skweeeeee! Love you lily!
Lilly is literally my mood... 😂😂😂
I got a skin care commercial before this video
I like how you made a realistic commercial when doing a sponsored video. In many sponsored videos, despite the creator's good intentions, advertising a product ends up awkward and you've turned awkwardness into humor - you rock! Also, I love the new outro, "one love Lilly" sounds awesome!
Absolutely wonderful ..
I love Olay and I love them more for their choices like you & Ali Raizman. Love it!!!! You are inspiration 💓💗💖
I got a Ponds cleansing balm as in the begging of this commercial I-😂💀
Oooh! Your hair looks so pretty

Edit: Thanks for all the likes!
There  was a skincare ad before the video 😂😂😂
the best part of this is 0:21 when Lilly fall down...
This is beautiful 😂💕💕💕
She wasn't kidding when she said she's gonna upload when she has a bomb idea.. damn👏
"That way the only dirt in my life is my girls group chat"
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Skincare product companies should choose you to do their commercials because you’re so good at doing it without making it sound rehearsed
Lol😂😂 I got a skincare ad
If OLAY didn't sponsor this video. Its not OKAY, OLAY
Imagine having clear skin??? A concept ✨✨
Hey lilly good work ,love from India .....
* the thumbnail *
Wow, Lily i've been waiting for a real commercial like this, thank you.
"I'm sorry..I thought I could do it" 🤣
The best #ad I’ve seen in a long time thanks so much for keeping it so real always you’re an inspiration!
I Love You!!!*and *Your vids
Can U do Collab with *Niki and Gabi Demar*? Pleaseeeeee?👼
Superwoman: Let's show a realistic skin care commercial
ALSO Superwoman: Let's show Ponds Cleansing Balm before every single video
Girl you frickin Beautiful!!
i love lilly but the beginning where she was like "it's in my eye" like isn't it supposed to be? it's water.
Admit it you’ve tried to splash water on your face like that when u we’re younger  




I’m a small youtuber and would love if I got ur support!!! :) ❤️
LMAO I love this 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️ so relatable
Is this just an actual commercial?
Lilly , this is literally so funny ! Lmao ! 😂
skin care tips: 
eat plant based
drink lots of water
sleep enough
Guys first things first...☺



Admit her beautiful face.😏😍😘
I understand those struggles😭 R.I.P Lily + me
Me: Slaps water on face KAY WE IS GOOD.
Lilly plz bring back my parents react to those are so funny 😁😎🤣
Is it ironic that I got a skincare commercial just before the video???
I absolutely love this video! 😂
Your ex married your bestfriend?!?!
"People give me anxiety"
I relate to that on a personal level.
Who else wants her to go back to the ‘types of’ videos
"I'm sorry, I thought I could do it". 😂😂 U still Canadian!!!!
LILY SINGH ONE DAY YOU WILL RULE THE WORLD 
like if u agree ❤️
Is this an actual ad?!! 😂😂😂
Real talk, how freaking cool is this video. Only Lilly can make a sponsored video so authentic
when i first found out about this channel, it only had ten million subscribers.
I´m glad she took a break, this feels more like her.. lovin´ it
That's it 
Lilly has to be the Head Of Department In Advertisement
Are you one of those people who does slow-mo in real life to try and copy commercials....
I live in OHIO
You are a legend! 🥰♥️
#Ad


Edit: thx for the like
1:41 ”People give me anxiety”
If that ain’t the truth 👏
That parallel parking is so me
my skin go through a lot....

me:girl...mine tooo
She is posting better content now keep up the good work ❤️love you lilllyyy!!!
This needs to be an actual Olay commercial😂
If some of the product worked like the actual Commercial Boy I would have gotten clear skin a long time ago
I literally  had an add that did the exact same thing that Lily did in the beggining
Lilly: I don't have time for myths and fads like.....
Other lady: Oh my god.........etc etc.
Me: Am i the only one who noticed that the lady was reading from  a BAWSE magazine with Lilly's face on it when she talked about the myth?
Ur so pretty! 🤗
I'm heading to 30. Got any tips for living my best life at this time, sis?
Edit: Girl that Olay! It was my first skin brand. So many mems.
You are f##king brilliant
I got a skincare ad before this vid




THE IRONYYYY
"my skin goes through alot"
Yeah same, so do i
Makes this video with flawless skin oh yah yah
OHMYGOD YASSS LILLY!!! 😍😍
You said one love lilly???
U should do a vid on realistic music videos
Such a good and fresh new video. The effort shows. I feel like Lilly is back. ❤
0:20 How did you slip on a carpet?
“People give me anxiety” 
Literally breathing gives me anxiety 💀💀💀
I didn't expect an actual commercial but I liked it
Legit just got a skin commercial 


It had that water a flower it up to their face 😂
This is the only ad I’m actually going to listen to 😂😂 lemme go get that face mask lmaooo
Pls make a video on...
Types of people at McDonald’s.
The parallel parking part :)lol
If this was an actual AD about skin care, then I would Actually buy the product lol

(Loved the video Lily! Keep it up!)
I wanted this to  be longer !!
Now this is how you do sponsorship 😂
“I use facial mist so my face isn’t thirty but my love life is” Lolol me
loving the new videos!! this is so clever :) so happy for u Lilly <3
I got olay ad before this. 😂💔
Higher quality equipment ≠ better content.
Don't think of this as hate - just trying to guide you to making better content
"One Love Lilly"
End of an Era
0:58 i died 😂😂😂
This needs to be a real ad
YOO HOW HER BUN UNWIND IN 0.5S @00:26
This is too related able. That it makes me feel uncomfortable but I love it lol literally as long as I have great skin I feel great LOL and my life really physically, literally and figuratively a mess.
Wow this was really creative Lilly I love this video 😍😁🤪💯
0:29 director: loly sonch? 😂
Looking gorgeous in thumbnail🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why is this not trending and why is it so relatable
bro the hair flip taking out the bun was so cool lol
When your mother really hates messy😂
"I'm a hot mess."
ME!
Using olay since 10yrs
¨what happens in Ohio stays in Ohio gurll!!¨
Hiiii your videos make my day and your so amazing
You are amazing Lilly ❤️ got me convinced to get some Olay in my life
Washing face with full sleeve is annoying af 🙄
I just watch an ad about skincare and i thought it's  already the video😂
The splashing is so unrealistic, show me the clip of a girl with her face shoved in the sink with her eyes closed tight with water going up her nose and slightly in her ears because she shoved her face too far under the pipe😂😂
0:20 My first thought... who slips on the wet carpet
Lilly's videos are so high production value though! #impressed
Switch to boost and get 100$ a month
Guys, she said “one love Lilly that is a wrap” instead of Superwoman...
Who agrees with me. Superwoman coming back strong 💪🏼
I literally got an Olay add before this-
THIS SHOULD BE REAL
When I think of Olay I always think it's for older women, you know to fight wrinkles. I was never into Lilly's humor
“1 love Lilly”  i hope ur doing better💗
Lilly you are so talented!!!!! Master of your craft!
I got a skincare commercial right before this, and the lady was literally splashing water on her face in the same exact way. Nailed it, Lilly. 👍
OMG Lilly you did so good in the olay skincare commercial
I am loving this new Lilly. ❤️❤️
"People give me anxiety" 
I relate to that on a spiritual level.
Hahha “our special microbeads...” 

Lili: “stop”
This is the best ad ever
This is the best..😁
Can olay make this an actual youtube ad tho...?
I didn't know Lilly was 30! Girl you look fine! Keep up the good vibes and you won't age ;P
Lol who else noticed on the clamp thingamajig it said
Actress: Loly Sonch
Director: Scarbro
2:25 "look, I'm easy" me
I got a neutrogena skin care ad before this lol
I'm yet to get used to "one love Lilly that's a wrap and zoop"
"what happens in ohio stays in ohio gurllll!!!"
i l-l-l-love you please s-s-s-see this your my i-i-i-dol ❤️
Who else got a video related ad?
The queen is back!
Please do a collab with NATOO from France!
I love this!!!!!!!! Ur so underrated!!!!!!! I love u soo much and I hope u stop getting hate for being u!❤️❤️
I was tired of the BS drama people had started around you it was draining reading the comments but today I just missed my Virgo sis and had to come through. Your channel is such a haven for a lot of people who are tired of the toxic stuff. Thanks for staying you and never changing. :) Btw cheeseburger? I thought you were a vegetarian or you stopped ?  😲
Who else had a skincare commercial 




Is it just me Ik it can’t be

Ok then
I have the same mug, it has always been my favourite mug before this video too.
Gosh. Trust Lilly to make a sponsored video seem honest AND funny at the same time! 😂😍🙌🏻

Dude. Not going to lie, I’ve fallen out of your videos for a while, because I felt the humor of was tired, but this was really funny and enjoyable ! Keep it up, 2019 Lilly!!!
I got a skincare commercial before I watched this with the water splash in the face.
😂😂😂 I love this !
I mean.. can we talk about that hair flip at 0:27 💯
I got a skincare ad before this...it was very unrealistic
As usual, she is hilarious. :)
i remember the time when lilly was funny she changed alot 🤦‍♀️
"Side salad, hold the lettuce!" .... I felt that..
I love the way she mentioned that it's an ad lol
I relate so hard. Honestly.
I love how the add before this video was legit a skincare add
I thought that said, "At least you have skin..."
OLAY
: insert bull fighting here :
0:05 I can relate so much I get soap in my eye literally all the time. I love you videos their so relatable and funny
0:20
I’ve never related to anything more.
What is the song title 🤷🏾‍♀️🤔🤔🤓🤓🧐🧐
MAN!!! I KNEW THIS WAS SPONSORED
Are you married? Lili sis
I GOT A NEUTROGENA AD RIGHT BEFORE THE VID
I loved this 😂😂😂♥️
When My ex got married TO MY BEST FRIEND

I use Olay and I love Lilly! #perfect!!!
My Cousin got married to an ex. 
We were best friends
She didn't even tell me.
Best Olay/Skincare commercial. Candidness works. I'm going buy the masks and one of the face cream.
"one love lily" huh, never heard her say that
"I'm sorry!  I thought I could do it. "
Lmao 😂😆😁😂😆😁
"fragrance free" yeah no that's never true
I think I adore this.
Please react to your very first
I watched a skincare commercial before this
I'm assuming its sponsored......... BUT THERE'S NO LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION I WANNA BUY THIS
This is one of my favorite videos ever
Olay really works
I agree with lilly
𝗢𝗛 𝗬𝗘𝗔𝗛 𝗬𝗘𝗔𝗛 𝗢𝗛 𝗬𝗘𝗔𝗛 𝗬𝗘𝗔𝗛 𝗢𝗛 𝗬𝗘𝗔𝗛 𝗬𝗘𝗔𝗛
when my ex got married to my bff im ded
I want this skin care line so bad know I have known about it but not all the products! My skin does not need a lot of attention but at times it does this stuff is perfect!
curology is q u a k i n g
I can’t believe that I watched an Olay ad.
@2:33 that’s Kenny her “ex”
WHAT HAPPENS IN OHIO STAYS IN OHIO GURLLL!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
Even if u dont write it as superwoman , you will always remain one , you are worthy of it !
“Side salad hold the lettuce” 😂
That's dope.....🤣
Wait. So the potato thing doesnt work? Cosmo LIED!
WHO WATCHED A SKIN CARE COMMERCIAL BEFORE THIS VID
Lmao I love you lilly
damn skin care gone dark
I was skeptical when I saw the title and thumbnail thinking this wasn't going to be a new style of videos at all, or that the new style wasn't something I was going to like. But after watching this, I can honestly say this was really good. It was really well scripted and planned, quick-paced and surprising, didn't bore me at all and I found myself laughing out loud more than once! This is the first superwoman video that I genuinely loved and watched till the end since a long time. Keep it up Lily :D
My mom : I bought this new product I'm sure it's gonna work
Me : The industry just wants to make money

The funny thing is that I watched a skincare ad before this video. And guess what? Everything you mention in this video happened inside that ad.😂
She's not even parallel parking at the end
Great ad. Tho, I'm already an olay user. My whole family is. Really works. Can't live without it.
If a ad like that came up before videos nobody will press the skip button
yes get that coin sis <3
We need more of these 🤣
‘At least you have nice skin’ 😂😂😂😂
Please make a video with mark
So perfect! 👌🏼
Side note though: I’ve been watching your videos for a few years and have been through really tough times (over the last two especially) and I cannot thank you enough for making me smile even just for a minute every time I watch your content. No matter what you do on your channels I will always be inspired by your work! Thanks Lilly for being phenomenal
lily tbh yr vdo's r nt as funny as they were bfore.
you're genius ❤
Oml a skin care commical came up right before this
You had me until 0:26
That hair flip tho
I was going to try to pick a relatable quote to type here with the caption "that's a mood" but there's too many to choose from
So to this entire video: that's a mood
"2:54 Sponsored by Olay. Get your day and night cream today!"
"salad, hold the lettuce"
The ending 😂😂
Is no one gonna talk about that thumbnail
She looks like a frikkin goddess
This is amazing!!!!!!!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Perfect!! 💛

This is how you do an ad.
This should be an ACTUAL add

“one loves lilly”😱
Ugh So realistic. So relatable. So quirky.

I live in Ohio, and I can confirm that that part is true. 😂

Love you so much lilly !💕
0:11 #Relatable
I saw you in a movie playing as a teacher

I love your videos♥️
that hair flip tho at 0:27
I love that's she said one love lilly! I am HERE for this self love
good afternoon, hopefully more successful
Oh... I didn't realize i watched a 3 minute ad until near the end.. Dammit
Companies looking to make ads, take notes. ^
This is such a good way to do a sponsored video
Is it me or does lilly look like bruno mars??..🤨
At least I’ll have nice skin
Oh yeah yeah
I never knew I would watch a 3 minute long commercial willingly and enjoy it 😂
I once went to audition for a skincare commercial.  They wanted a thin model with beautiful skin... I lost that part because neither I've perfect figure nor my skin looks flawless. :( My Life Story ...still I love myself ;)
Well that was depressing.
I’m from Ohio........😂
i need these products asap
That was awesome 😂😂😍😍😍♥️♥️😍🦄
Lol great job
i got a curology ad on this....
You called?
ok but that olay pore detox looks nice
You should do a video where your mom watches Marie kondo and then starts cleaning EVEN more than she usually does
that was wired
When your commercial is better than kendall Jenner's
What happens in vegas stays in vegas gurl😂😂😂
Please make video with Ellen 😍 please please
So creative!
1:00 
 Me I don’t drink water and my skin is dry like the California desert in August
I think i can parallel park, but now people are falling off bridges.

 Hustle to ALIGNED ❤️❤️❤️
Realistic Haircare commercial too please!! <3
you should do a video on "embarrassment insurance" and how the agents save you from embarrassing situations
This is good haha
This is so good 😂😂😂😂😂
Superwoman is back.....
It’s really weird that for the past few weeks, I have been struggling with the most horrible break out in my entire teenage years and now I’m seeing all these amazing videos about positivity and just the whole idea of not letting acne bring you down. I don’t even know if I should call it a coincidence but these videos are definitely a blessing for me. Thank you ❤️
The only channel where I can watch a whole commercial with a smile on my face and no urge to skip
I thought you were 19
Je suis sorry for the hate. I just was naive. But its ok we cool?
Lilly’s face (in the thumbnail that photo). Perfection 😭❤️ she’s so beautiful
Who's here after she came out?❤🏳️‍🌈
My mom works for Olay so every time i see it I get excited lol
How tf was the mom and her in the same frame
Olay is actually the real deal. Been using it for 25 years, people always think I have some magic secret to good skin, but it’s just Olay moisturizers and Dove soap.
Wow, your content has gone wayyy better. It was good before, but now it’s starting to exceed!
when i saw the thumbnail i actually didn’t realize it was her and thought it was a commercial
Look I'm easy!!
You now what she is right people need to stop with the water splashing because now lily said something I think it is weird like what do you need to do that and I feel bad for the people who clean the mess up 😂
You know you're early when the only comments you see are first...I was about to go to sleep but saw this notif and clicked instantly.
lol so true
Why  do  you  hold  your  cup like that? 2:33
Does amazing hair flip from what was a bun. Yeah... Realistic...
This is so good
One love Li-





My heart stopped
One love superwoman was the thing. It's changed to one love Lilly now😭😭😭
“People give me anxiety”

MOOD
did i actually enjoy a 3 minute ad? yes.
true😹😹😹
0:3 0:8 0:17 bass sounds good in cheap headphones also...
If ever the irony 😂😂
Lilly Singh ft Mike Tyson plz

This type of commercial would make me but products its relatable , realistic, comforting, and trustable
OMG I LOVE THIS!!! So happy Lilly is back ❤️❤️❤️

This is so real and funny! 😇
Most entertaining ad ever?
Honestly I have dry and oily skin and skincare routine that my dermatologist gave me makes my skin super dry and red all day and I don’t know what to do
YOUR GORGEOUS EYES 😷DONT HAVE YOUR DADDY GET THE DOUBLE PUMP SHOT GUN😰
Lilly DOES NOT LOOK 30 SHE LOOKS SOO MUCH YOUNGER!!
oh my gosh I love that
BEST Commercial ever!!
Thats so funny.this is the best ad i have ever seen 👍
Did anyone get a Neutrogena ad before the video ? 😂😂
I love you!!!
Anyone get a skin care ad before this?
i love it lol might actually check out the product
I love you, like really hard. (?
My real skincare ad would be 'everything new I put on my face makes me break out' 😕
Ok team super, OUR MOM IS BACK!! Thank you Lilly for giving yourself a self love rest period💛 to come back making amazing content you’re passionate about and it’s an AD...giiiiirrrrl you slammed dunked this one into amazement for Olay #bestyoutubead. Always and forever love you Unicorn Mom💛💜💛
WHO TF WASHES THEIR FACE LIKE THAT
I have the same cup 2:37
Who else had a skin ad before the video
Wait wait wait!!! Lily isn’t actually 30 right? She looks 24 at the most 😱
The one advertisement I wouldn’t skip
So damn creative. Love this 😍😍 (also gives me low key Ryan higa vibes. I don’t even know why 😂)
Admit it you’ve tried to splash water on your face like that when u we’re younger  




I’m a small youtuber and would love if I got ur support!!! :) ❤️
MY skin IS WHy IM StIll SInGle
This is how ever add should be. :) Haha
Please do not buy Olay - they are not cruelty-free, this means that this brand tests on animals or finances animal testing
This is so true I have olay face wash and it’s so good, it cleared my skin I’m less than three days! Now my skin glows and it’s smooth
OMG SHE IS BACK
Please lilllyyyyyyy maam ...please do parents reacting to twerk by cardi b ...please please please
...but her skin is already perfect....
I’m lovin’ that one love lily
This is the best commercial ever!!!!!
You know what is funny that these video is about skincare ad and when the video start a add came up and it was of skincare
From now on I’ll only accept to watch ads like those
Every single time l watch your videos you always use the word "genuinely".
“At least you’ll have nice skin”
ONE LOVE LILLY??
Side salad hold the lettuces 😂😂😂
Love this
Lilly and nigahiga YouTube's last sketch comedians left.....
I got an ad for a skin care product before this video and the girl did the water splash thingy and I just started laughing so much
WHAT YOUR THIRTS YOU LOOK LIKE 21
olay is a #ad
It’s actually impressive that Lilly puts on Sharpie and markers for yt videos but her skin is still glowing!
that's one long commercial Lily
This is definitely getting me to buy Olay omg they know what they’re doing
First 3 minute ad that I actually finished watching and that I actually paid attention to
Who is this well i came for my job oh yeah yeah
1:48 was the side salad the bad life choice lol
"look, im easy" LMAO
I really need to try this as i've tried other skincare products but I usually end up with my skin breaking out because of them.... I've even tried hypoallergenic ones like Aveeno! Nothing seems to be gentle enough for my sensitive skin, but maybe this will! Besides, I already use Olay bodywash anyways :)
Selenators :)
Lilly is 30
I got a neutergeina makeup remover ad
I’m not trying to hate but how Lilly slip by water on carpet?🤔🤔🤔
How ironic there was a skincare commercial right before the video
I got an acne ad before this
I couldn't stop watching this ad.
Love this
The very last scene, relatable af
Clear skin??? What’s that never heard of it
Oh your 30 thought you were in your 20s because you look beautiful. Not trying to hit on you btw.
I confess!
When I go to the bathroom or take a shower I act like I'm doing a video
Me:so hey guys today I'm gonna show you what I use in the the show .so here we have-
Can you do a whole video in Hindi on Punjabi
Why is there an ad that’s 3:22 minuets long
I'm watching this while using a face mask from a different company lol
BEST AD WANNA SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR ON TV
The only problem with Olay is that they test on animals :/// No amount of vanity is worth the life of an innocent animal
So cool, Lilly :)
the parallel parking bit was too real lmfao
You weren't made more money what does promo add sponsor it was on TV
if i gotta see an ad this is the kind of ad i wanna see
Im SoRrY i ThOuGhT I CoUlD dO iT
You are my HERO
Well written..still an add
I feel like the content is getting back to its previous level
omg i have the same cup as you
Things that happen in Ohio do stay in Ohio. I’m and Ohioan!
this is so cute
Hahahahahahah I love it!!
Best olay commercial
so are u subscribed to T-series?!
Hahaha love that
I had an olay commercial before this vid....
Why did a skincare ad just pop up before I watched this video 😂
LOV3 YoU❤
You’re amazing. I totally love your content and people who are into creativity often encounter feelings of sadness and loneliness from time to time because they’re putting all their energy into creating something new. Your energy does not look forced. You might be going through something or might have gone through something before because of which you lost a little bit of “you” but that’s totally fine. Be yourself! Love you loads. x ♥️
i love your humor, i swear your videos always shine a bright light on my days, however im a bit concerned to know you're promoting a brand that tests on animals
Lilly should do all commercials 😆😆😆
Hilarious!
Finally she’s funny again
Shade on the haters in the comments
😂😂😂😂 I love her!!!
This was posted on my moms bday
Why do not you speak Arabic?
The only way I'd buy Olay was if they changed their name to Olilly
The only ads I won't skip
I can't believe it I a so proud of you guys you guys didn't make a single hate comment
Here I thought we were going to be told that drinking water would be the best for our skin (after the "three grapes" discussion).
Lilly is the only YouTuber who uploads in the morning as per Indian Standard Time... 😆😆
THANKS A LOT,  LILLY! That's really convenient!!
WOW THIS WAS REALLY RELATABLE

I love her hair

Actually  bad skins comes up when you wash your face too much. You should only be washing your face one time a month at most. I read this in a Facebook post. He's pretty smart so it's legit
1:51 that’s how you know there’s nothing in the cup. It’s bothering me so much, 😫.
I like this one because I DON’T WASH MY FACE BY SPLASHING WATER ON IT
Dang I have acne...
Wait she’s 30???

The only ad that matters
im in ohio
was i just baited to watch an olay commercial
I love your videos they make  me laugh
Step 1: Have good genetics
Are they slipping on wet carpet?
@iisuperwomanii if you’re still doing this can you get your parents to react to 7 Rings - Ariana Grande please?
Olay is kinda good right ...??
Your bi at least accept it don’t go on about 50 boys
Lilly YOUR 30 YEARS OLD???????
Lol people give me anxiety too, Lilly
I'm new to this channel.
One quick question, Is she an Indian? 
Please,can anyone tell for me...
I love you!!
Oh yeah yeah
These are the types of ads you'll never skip and you'll love even if they start at the middle of your favourite part in a movie.

Edit: typo
I like it all, but.. why does she say 'One love Lilly' now? I miss the superwoman outro!! Want it back.  Ples.
Lilly's old she like 30
Think about it if someone messes up a skincare ad they have to dry their hair over and over again
loly songh
This need to be on tv ferreal!!
I swear I thought you were Michelle Obama in the thumb nail
you did a really good job of showing off the product but at the end of the video i was like wow she didn’t make that 3 minute ad boring, she made it relatable and funny so good job lilly!
😍😍😍🇹🇹🇹🇹
Thus is so much better than the actual show.
Hello Lily and Community! Anyone have any tips for healing facial skin burns?
Poo in the loo
Love how there was a skin commercial before this video😂
like if Lilly  is the best
Nothing like skiping ads to watch an ad.
There was a curology commercial right before this video 😂
How about I tell you over dinner? 🙄 Brunch? 🙄Coffee? 🙄FaceTime? 🙄I am easy😌😌😌!!?? 
WASTED 😂
37 views , 377 likes and 47 comments ... YouTube is broken again
Tbh lilly is creative a f i love her queen of everything.
Best ad ever. I have never cared about skincare until now. I legit want that pore stick.
This is the best commercial ever
ONE LOVE LILLYYYYYY AHHHH MY HEART
2:10 she looks like renegade raider from fortnite
is dis bish an add
Crazy B😹
You should do types of school days.
Well it was a OLAY commercial 😂
Trying to get use to... "One Love *LILLY* that is a wrap and ZOOP"
I didn't even know she was 30
30?!
HELLO SUPERWOMAN I LOVE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS EVERYDAY AND I ALSO LIKE IT TOO AND I ALSO THINK YOUR SO PRETTY AND BEAUTIFUL AND AWESOME AND AMAZING AND COOL AND FUNNY TOO OKAY LILLY 💚💙😍😎💋
no hate but these self deprecating jokes are getting kinda old and unfunny. especially since lilly always tries to spread love and positivity
If I wash my face like they do in ads I'd go to school with soap all over my face !!
Ur 30 years old and still single like go get married
LOL
Lilly Ji can we please get shady moments back?
That awkward moment when you get a Tresemmé ad before the video . . .
hang it this way
Killing it!!
Who slips on carpet?
Wow and I did upload a similar video on my channel its lit
I'm not kidding I just got and ad for  skin care
Haha 😂💖
Only lilly and what's up mom's can make ads watchable
Olay
Olayyy Olay olayyy
She's 30???????
I think this is the only honest commercial in the WORLD!
Gurl, love the gritty reality of this one.. but then I am 62 and here to tell you still FEEL  like 27.. when I am sitting down but that is because of Inclusion Body Myositis. (May is Myositis awareness month) Hate the commercials where everyone has BMI of 3 and is ready for Olympics, no stress, no canes or ungraceful getting 6'1 frame with legs up to there which no longer want to work out of a car. Just wait, I got bored because friends were mostly work related and now disabled and soooo damn lonely...found out 3 of old boyfriends died. My zits disappeared when I hit full on menopause at 56...hormonal storms like .... Peace and lots of water in body as nothing ON it works as well.
THIS
Lily u look like Zelina Vega, please meet your doppleganger, shes a wrestler, you love wrestling
Believe me when I was a young I thought splashing my face with water that way was possible and necessary and boy did I get into trouble about the whole bathroom - floor AND wall - getting wet when my mother found out! 👀
Ha this was soo funny
R U 30 Yrs old?

Like really?
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Best commercial ever
Ironically, I did almost get hit by a car on my birthday once.  It was a beautiful, sunny morning, so I went for a run down by the waterfront........which is across a very busy intersection.  A car coming around the corner didn't stop, and almost hit me.......but fortunately, didn't hit me.  I don't think I even remember what else I did that day, but I'll always remember that.
Olay has the best commercials
Is this were a real commercial....I would buy it
i use OLAY ... thats all
Preach
Should've been the ad...
“What happens in Ohio stays in Ohio” just like the accident of Logan Paul
Lili doesn’t look like a 30 year old, who agrees?
😂💕💕💕💕💕
#Ad
Get that money giiirll hahahahaha
GG
Lmao
If this is how the commercials were I'd actually buy the products
I got Sephora commercial.........How relevant
This works better then their actual commercials
So nobody notice her deliberately not saying superwoman??
Lilly:" what up everyone it's your girl LILLY"
ME:*takes q-tips and cleans ears*repeats the video
Lilly:*says the same thing*
ME:*runs to the doctor*
She is me when im acting like im happy but im dying inside
Yesterday: Superwoman
Today: Lilly
Tomorrow: Unicorn?

Always: Bawse

We love you ... Lilly!
Low key annoyed reading all these comments about her “fake enthusiasm”. It’s 2019, let people be excited about what makes them happy. Stop criticizing others and go find what makes you happy. ✌🏼
When she said what up it’s lily.... 😯😱
Like if u were SHOOKKKKK 😱
mental health is not something you can just fix by ‘calming down’ or whatever. to people saying she’s faking her happiness, just be proud that she actually got out of bed to make this and other content. depression is something lilly has dealt with before and even cracking a smile and being positive is a wonderful achievement or breakthrough in improving your mental health. give her time to get better and to decide how to destress. if you aren’t excited for the change just don’t watch, don’t hate. please.
“It’s your girl Lily!”

...Hold my beer
Lilly don't you dare worry about these negative comments. You are a talented person and inspiration to many. This change was much needed and it will surely lead to optimistic results. I believe in you. Stay happy :)
Funny how people bash lily of being energetic and happy when 
1. It's her personality and if you don't like it then don't watch her videos
2.  Do u expect her to sit and talk in the camera acting all depressed? yet when people are sad you bash them to be happy! y'all haters are impossible
Lilly: "WHat up everyone"
Me: "Its your girl" 
Lilly: "Lilly"
 Me : shook
Okay so this is just my opinion. I have the right to comment on this video cause this is youtube. 

As a young Indian girl, I used to LOVE her back in the days where she filmed her videos in Canada. She was one among the very few Indian youtubers back then and her content was just so funny and creative. (Eg: Girls on period, Girls Group chat, etc.,) Before the entire "UNICORN" stuff happened, that was when her content was excellent. Just like many celebrities fame got to her and turned her (or her content) into a fake cringey and unfunny. Maybe this change could bring her old self back. But she should remember that she has her fame now, because she was real back then. 

Oof I have been wanting to say all of this for years now haha No offence to her Unicorns (fans) or whatever lol
i think the reason stopped watching lily was that when she got a production company, her videos became a bit too high end lol
I can’t even express my relief after hearing that you won’t be uploading twice a week anymore. We can all agree that was a LOTTT of work, and you need to, and deserve to, take it easy. And also have more fun by uploading whenever tf you feel inspired.
It's like you've shared your feelings... but you haven't. Yes we are your team, that's why it's okay to be real with us. No biggy, we're all human. Take your time sure, and come back to us when you're ready. But you be avoiding saying 'superwoman' and calling yourself 'Lilly' to imply your real humanity but still be acting like superwoman. 

Honestly I don't know what I just watched. What change?
liliy: “what up everyone...”
me:😌
lily: “its your girl LILY ”
me:🤭oh mah gad
“WHAT UP EVERYONE ITS YOUR GIIRL LILY”
me: messing up while I say it with her wait what
If only Gloria Borger saw this...
Next Shane's series. "SuperWoman's true face" I see that happening this year. Yay for 2019. 
I know she will be able to come up with amazing content... but she's going thru a looot. And it's obvious.  I miss that happy inspiring unicorn that she used to be.. and I truly hope she will get over this moment of her life and come back one day even stronger than before.
i've watched her for about 3 years now and i can tell this is forced.  and i agree with some of the below comments.  it seems fake.  i've seen fakeness and faking happiness because i've been there. i think lilly should continue her break.  this video is too hyped up, she should try being a little bit... average, almost.  it's okay to be average and not always smile or make a sarcastic comment.  as someone said below, try being more relatable, because in reality, no one, no one person is happy 24/7
When she said “what up everyone it’s your girl Lilly” in stead of “what up everyone is your girl Superwoman” 😦😧😟🧐🤔😢
I really liked her in 2014 i watched every video but honey as much as i love you since 2016 i stoped watching i felt the videos changed and lily changed and all the celebrities cameos UGH. i really wish she comes back to her roots .
PS. This video had tooo much fake excitement
Maybe she wasn’t that excited n happy because the world didn’t know that she is bi here I feel like she kept her secrets in and didn’t really feel like herself now everyone knows and she’s happier ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I just think we don't need to repeatedly voice all the negative things she probably already has jumbling around in her head. Yes she does seem a little forced hyper and all that, still, all the comments about her channel dying and her being irrelevant are unnecessarily harsh and I hope she doesnt magnify those thoughts in her head and chooses instead to be grateful for how far she's come and the views she's pulling now. She is transitioning, she is getting older, and we are growing with her. She could get in touch with older youtubers like Ryan Higa and talk with them about how they have managed that. And I'd like her to talk as she wants too and not necessarily hyper all the time if she doesnt feel like.  You can be Lilly now, we will still always appreciate "Superwoman". I just want you to be okay, Lilly❤
“ITS YOUR GIRL... LILY”
Stop with the negativity!! Lilly teaches nothing but positivity and love to her viewers, and suddenly everyone seems to be turning their backs on her. Of course she is exaggerating, all youtubers do. Lilly is branching out and I think that there is nothing but greatness coming for her. Keep hustling girl, we love you and are so proud. :) ❤
geez what's up with all the hate? she's human you know! obviously she needs some time to take care of herself, but do we really need to hate on her? lily, the only advice i can give you is to do what makes you happy, not what you think will make others happy. we appreciate how hard you've been working, but i hope that you will take some time to work that hard on yourself rather than your videos. im tired of people saying you are trying to be "relevant," and if that is what you are doing, i hope you know that you don't have to. we just want you to be  so many of us love you, but in order to spread love you have to have it for yourself first. please don't force yourself to be someone youre not just to make the internet happy. it isnt worth the self-loath that comes along with it.
”Hey everyone it's your girl LILLY”

me: what happened here now?
You cant force positivity.
People think positively to feel better. Being positive is being optimistic. All those comments saying she’s turned cringey or she’s forcing her positivity, please stop. Because telling her she’s forcing it will just make her think negatively. Let her go, if she’s doing something, then let her do it. 
She wants to change her channel? Then let her be. 
You think this channels has already changed? Then we don’t wanna hear about it.
You think her videos are cringey now?
Then stop watching them.

She doesn’t need to read more of your comments that could ruin the positivity.
Lilly looking like that medical student my parents all want me to be but isn’t ever gonna happen lol
I love you, but you need a longer break. Anywho, we'll see how the changes improve the channel.
She started this schedule to prepare for her new talk show🙃🥳
Everyone says that she looks too enthusiast, she is doing videos to spread positive vibes so showing enthusiasm is actually the point... She does what she likes and she is happy about it so why are you so annoyed by it. If you want to see videos of people showing you their vulnerable side than you can look them up on youtube and find them. She also has some videos in which she shows that she also have burn-outs so you can go watch these.
Y’all keep saying that this is “ forced positivity “ from Lily , well guess what, if you all are being so negative about it. Then I think Forced positivity is what you need. And to be honest . I don’t recall her asking for your opinions about it. Let her change, we as followers cannot comment on that. If anyone is a true supporter. You would support her regardless. Besides it’s not like you’ve lived in her shoes to understand why she’s doing what she is doing.
Just like a lot of people I've been watching you for 5 years now and pretty sure you're one of the first YouTubers. I was one of thos kids that was never really involved in technology, so when i got my first phone (not apple lol) i was exploring a guess you could say and i found YouTube, there was so many videos of everything and people. I'm not sure how i found you but I'm glad i did everyday after school i would watch one of your video and you would make me laugh so loud that my mom would ask if i was okay XD you made me forget about all the bad thing that was going on and made me happy. Your channel has changed a lot and has gone through many "phases" but one thing that hasn't changed was you. I'm sorry this was very long but i hope you how much you mean to the world.  Love, a weird sappy fan
Lilly- “take a breather”
Me- “Mom, I’m taking a break for the winter semester of college”
Mom- *laughing* “You’re gonna take a break when you bring home your PhD”
I am disgusted by all these "forcing positivity" comments, she's trying her best. I bet she's trying not to break down. I have been a fan ever since her "Things girls do" videos and of course, her channel has changed. Constructive criticism is great but some of these comments are just rude. You can't fix mental health by just "Calming down" or stuff like that. She's just positive and energetic, so what? get over it. She's happy and she deserves to be. She works hard and she gets the credit she deserves. All I'm saying is, you need to remember that she needs to be healthy as well. Please just give her time. Her channel is doing fine. Mkay, I love you Lilly. Bye.
why you look like someone who presenting new product? hhaha..suddenly you look so serious...
all the best for 2019...
my mind: 
lilly: it’s your girl Lilly
my mind: chaos
When she faked that  she was leavening for a bit but then 2 days later there were videos with other people...
i seriously want to date Lily Singh!! she's flupping beautiful!!
I know u probably won't see this, but I thought I'd at least try 😂
I've just started watching ur videos and u r actually so inspiring. Just your content in general makes me smile. I think it's great that you are doing what makes you happy. So happy I discovered ur channel.
I got scared when she said whatsupp it’s lily 😥
Me:
Lilly: wat up its your girl
Me: superwoman
Lily: lilly
Me: oh no she aint... no... oh heck naw....
Me: llumanati comfirmed
Sees rest of video
Me: tank de lord
Phew
Gave me a heart attack lmao
I honestly don’t watch your videos, I’ve seen like 2 in your whole YouTube career. Why? I have a cousin who looks exactly like you and have the same personality, and I enjoy my time with her but I can’t seem to enjoy your videos just because it seems forced.

I hope one day you find your true self and be happy with it,  I hope those fears of judgement that we all can see in your eyes don’t hold you back anymore. I hope you find your happiness.
PLEASE DONT PULL A LIZA!!!I NEED YOU ON YOU TUBE!!!
Her~ what up everybody it's yo gurl LILY 
me~ SHOOK, what did she say! Where's superwoman?😮😮😮
Welcome to the squad!!! LGBTQ+ 🏳️‍🌈
Love your positive vibes. Much love ❤️❤️❤️
Am I weird for thinking that this is how YT creators should actually post? And by that I mean, to post something when they actually have a good idea and not according to a schedule when it's forced most of the time?
I honestly think you just need to be more real and honest with people. Lately, I’ve realised the only channels I’ve really stuck with for longer than a couple of years are the ones where I can see a noticeable difference in the creator. Seeing their content change with them, rather than feeling they have to pretend to be something they’re not. It feels like this platform is so over saturated with the fake, it feels great when you’re watching someone that doesn’t feel forced or scripted, ya know? I’m not saying for every video but I think every now and again, if you let yourself be more natural instead of your usual over positive “superwoman” character, it might really help. 
But idk, just take it as food for thought.
You are doing great😘😘 
A person filled with  enthusiasm 😍😍
You make me so happy .
😘😘love you

Repeat it 6 times after “have to” and the 6th time let it play after
Amazing news Lilly congrats yo! #TeamSuper forever! 👊🏽
I wish I could take a breather......from school.
I have been here sense the beginning and I will still be here I was here sense I was 6 and now I am 13 I love your videos and that will never change your the best I love you and I love how your honest and you see us like we are your family superwomen power
Who's here after she came out as bi????
Love you loads of love and support 💕💕💕💕💕😁😁😁👏👏👏
interesting. i feel like people just get bored of her “positivity” and now they’re saying stop faking whatever. Nonsense 🤦‍♀️
@ all the people who clicked this video, haven’t finished watching the video, read some negative comments and decided to press the comment button to type one of their own: a lot of you may not have watched her content for too long and to jump on the bandwagon based on what is “trendy” is wrong. I think people don’t realize that what they say is actually read by real people who have real feelings. And not just Lilly; just because the creator does not respond to you does not mean that he/she has not seen the comment. Human beings don’t get better by hate and negative opinions; they get discouraged. Next time you decide to restate what’s already been said in the comment section over and over, think twice and realize what a great difference a nice comment or no comment at all would make xx
Something feels .....off about Lilly
lets make mental health a trend in 2019 too. Take care Lily, looking forward to your new vids ☺️
I don’t like the change but I understand that you have a life too and have things to take care of😁
I am so in love with you💖
I'm glad Ur feeling better after Ur brake. Hope U will have amazing and exciting journeys ahead of U in 2019. All the best Lilly 👍
I love you no matter what Lilly😁😁😁😁😁😁❤❤❤❤❤im your biggest fan!!!!🎠🎠🎠
Anyone else miss Lily’s video with her parents💙I always go back and rewatch em✌🏼
Can I take a break...







From school...






Permanently??
WE GOT U LIlLY WE LOVE YOUUUUUU. Also my resolutions already went downhill but then theres Lilly sticking to these things. Im dead-
YouTube must be broken



Why are there 9.6k dislikes and 88k likes?!?
Could you PLEASE make a video about your "parents" reacting to Ariana Grandae- "Thank U, Next," Camila Cabello- "Havana," or Dua Lipa "New Rules?" Your "parents" have the FUNNIEST REACTIONS AND ARE SO CLUELESS!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Love you, Lilly!💕
I’m not the first,


*hello darkness my old friend.*

IM GONNA LIKE MY OWN COMMENT. 😂

Edit: Oop I GOT 88 LIKES? Or idk 😐 BUT THANKS IF THIS IS A GLITCH BY YOUTUBE THEN UHM FCUJKCKGOGOOG.
I’m into this! 
Just resubscribed cause I think you lost your way for a bit but I’m back now to support ya
This channel literally my made life so much easier! I first starting your video when I was in university and stressed tf out lol but that was years ago..I feel like I grew up with you and just don’t get the same vibe as before with your content..still love u thou♥️
H I love you so much you make me work harder and like feel like girls are all reunited together to make girl power I lobe you so much 💜💜
Aaaarrghhh yessss but why lilly and not superwoman?!?!?!?!?!?!!?? 💞💝
No views... I think I can say that I’m early😂😂 






PS Lilly I Love You
I am so tired of people saying, for lots of youtubers not just Lilly, that their content changed and now it isn’t as good.  LET PEOPLE CHANGE!
"i don't have to tell you [...] but i want to" = i need to build hype and click bate this videos.
You just posted in my birthday OMG ^_^
Honestly, I think you need to just be more real on camera. It kind of seems like you're overdoing the enthusiastic persona and it makes it hard for people to truly connect with you. Be vulnerable. You don't have to put on an act.
Heyyy Lilly girlfriend 😘💗❤️
Love your videos girls 💗❤️💗❤️💗❤️
But momma, please please please, keep the old intro, and the outro, you are my superwoman, our superwoman ❤️
I missed the countdown to 2019 because I was biusy watching drunk people on my road
Still love ya Lilly. Focus on you and your health. Do you boo. ❤😊
Growth and change is what turns seeds into gigantic trees. We stand behind you, we knew this was a long time comming, and we still support you. Team Singh loves you.
Honestly I waited and hoped for this video for a long time now. I've been following you since I was 13 and I'm 18 now and you are my favorite creator since then. You are glowing and I'm so happy you made a decision to take care of yourself because you truly deserve it. I love your content and the amount of work you put into it inspires me in many ways. I support what you do and can't wait to see what's coming. Sending all the love from Bulgaria. ♥
So are you changing your channel I would like to see another channel name from my girl Lily!

Edit; Maybe Lily’s Laughs because your videos always make me laugh 😂
Do you Lilly!❤️. I’m soo happy about this change🤗
You have so much charisma and I seriously love your honesty I do agree that happiness is very important, ps you go, keep working hard!
You haven't done a "My Parents React" in soooo long
Me: Sees the title
Also me: FINALLY!
Loly Sonch 🤣🤣I’m on the floor!!!
We support you Lilly always!! ❤❤
Inspiring Like Always! :)
Lilly Singh is changing and Ryan Higa is changing WOOW
All these comments about “forced positivity” and I’m a bit like,  bruh, this is how she’s always been. 😂😂 Love ya, Lilly!
I just wanted to say that I love ure book How to be a bawse!!! Its so awesome. Ure my inspiration Lilly Singh
Dear Lord! So much hate in the comments. People damn! The girl is going through some negative times. Everyone's way of dealing with that is different. This is hers. If you can't spread positivity. Don't say anything.
Stay strong Lily!! Glad you are prioritizing your happiness 😊
Can't wait for everyone's video about this
Ssssoooo prouddd of ya girlll😭😭❤❤❤you'll be killin' it no doubt! And we support u as always💪💪
So when people put their emotions online ppl yell at them to keep it to themselves and go see a therapist but when people don’t do it they get mad and yell st them to put their emotions out online... make up ur damn mind

Aweee..... ❤
Nowadays, I don’t have the time to watch YouTube like I used to, and Lilly is one of the reasons why. She is such an inspiration, and when I do have the time, I often opt for her videos. She’s definitely one of my favourite YouTubers, and I don’t say this about many of them.
i still dont get why she's not saying superwoman...? im sloww please explainnn sksksksksks
I am happy u made this decision. 
What happens when Lilly takes a break?
Good decisions, merch lines and 12 collabs. 


LOL You go girl!
Fake enthusiasm and forcing positivity 😂
lilly , we love you. you have been inspiring me from long and i want you to know we love you and we are proud of you. your journey has been incredible and we are excited with you through your ups and downs, thank you for being the beautiful human being you've been and are, never change. keep going,keep doing

GIRL- I'm only happy if you're happy! Xx
This video is definition of forced positivity on YouTube.
Congratulations lily ❤️💛💚💙
This is late but yay for you!!
Lilly doesn’t seem happy from inside. Feel like she is faking being funny and happy in front of the camera. Who else feeling the same ?
Excited for the new changes she's making to this channel! Not sure how I feel about the new intro/outro though. . .
I loved her more as Superwoman. Don't get me wrong, I adore Lilly ❤❤. But I miss my Superwoman
That's great! More power to you ❤
Also, I have started reading you 'How to be a Bawse' book this year, and I am happy to say that it's amazing. You really are an amazing person!
Epic epic video xx🌈🔥💜
I feel like I need to say this. I used to watch Superwoman every day. Lilly was such a funny, sweet and inspirational person. And she still is. I will always support her and wish her the best, but I stopped watching her videos over the past year. The thing is her videos changed a lot. And change isn't necessarily bad. But her videos don't feel genuine like they used to. It feels like she's not sincere anymore and she really needs to take a longer break. I just want her to take care of herself, go on a vacation maybe or spend some time with her family. We can wait as long as we have to. The most important thing is that she's happy and healthy. We don't need a lot of content and collabs. We just need Lilly to be happy. That's all. ❤
This video felt forced. Like she hasn't separated herself from the character superwoman. Not trying to spill hate, she is obviously more successful than anyone in the comments myself included, but this doesn't change the feeling that her videos feel forced.
Haha all my love to superwoman, 
Luv that the video hasnt even been up for 30 mins and got this many comments 💖💖💖
Hi lilly
Great changes 
Great things to come 
Love ya 
I’m glad your adapting to make ur life better and manageable
I'm younger than you, but! I FEEL LIKE A PROUD MOM!
Lilly even if you have a hard time with the haters and you are literally dying inside, remember that supporters like me are out there supporting you❣️
beautiful, positive, motivational as ever, I LOVE YOU
Lilly:What up everyone it’s your girl.......

Me: Superwoman 

Lilly:  

Me:Oh No...... 😰 wait this can be a good thing........or not......
I'm reading 'how to be a bawse'

You should write a sequel with your life update <3
The first change is that she uploaded this on wednesday 0.0
thank you lilly!!.. on days that i feel the worse, your videos make me funny so hard! I thank God for you! 
do whatever you need to do! .. i will be waiting for that notification 
one LOVE
I love you Lilly, but you need to address the fact that this channel is dying. Low views and irrelevancy is plaguing your content and it honestly makes me so sad to see you fall so far. You were on top of the world and now...well.. you’re just not.
Midlife crisis?
Burnt out?
Or
Not Motivated?

This was not an Honest video. Didn't felt from the heart.
You deserve more subscribers.
Hello random person scrolling down the comments hope you have a good day!😊
I'm so excited for the new changes!!! Because you're doing what best for you, you inspire me to do what is best for me and take charge of my life. Thank you for always being such an amazing, positive example Lilly, love you!!!<3
Lilly-0:02
Me-shook
Now that is what I call growth♥️ .....I LOVE YOU
Man It must’ve been awhile since I watched one of her videos. She doesn’t even call herself superwoman anymore? Where has she been. Guess the better question is where have I been? 🤔
So so so proud of you ❤️
I respect this so much Lilly love ya since 2 million ❤️🌍 🤘🏾
If only she will shed a bit of character and show her real self,  then maybe somehow this channel will be relevant again.
I missed Lily and when she made those hilarious skits
Ohhhh FINALLY. CHANGE. 
it's a good thing. I promise.
How about a video about a shampoo commercial or how to make a salad (obviously plus something like the diy sandwich) or types of people in public or dog food commercial with ur doggo
Having trouble finding 'add subtitles' is that just on PC?
I’ve been a fan of you since I was in 6th grade and now I’m in 11th grade and I have never met you in person😪😪. You were my first idol that was a YouTuber.
Yesterday, superwoman, today, lily, always bawse
I can't take a break from school... (  ._.)
Awesome! Thanksfor spreading positivity and reminding people to focus on themselves <3 You're amazing
Forced positivity and sexism channel
Do what you gotta do, Lily! _
why did you say lily..
NOOOO
This is an extraordinary experience. Observe. This is what someone trying to claw their way to relevancy looks like
She said Lilly 😁😁😁that's my girl
Hmmm i see some sort of sadness in your eyes😐
I hope you find your balance and positivity again. It's hard to keep pushing, you end up exhausted and you aren't yourself anymore. Do what you need for your own mental health, that's more important than anything else. We're all human and we all need a break, we all have dark periods in our lives. What matters is how well we take care of ourselves during those times. I wish you strength and peace <3
Will we still have Manjeeth and Paramjeeth
I am soooo sad about the less uploads Lilly was one of the YouTubers that was consistent but now I guess that all changed.
Im so sorry that ur sad, ive been watching u since i was 13(im 20 now) and i have love for u but ur obvsly not happy and it show, i hope u get better
HAVE A BLESSED 2019 ❤❤For those who sees this comment 😘😘You Cute
Love you I MISSED YOU SO MUCH😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
missed you, and excited for these changes, Lily. :) You have full support.
"This Channel is Changing!"
changes pfp
I LOVED YOUR STORYBOOTH VIDEO! I honestly watched it 50 times!
At risk of sounding like an awful person, hopefully this change gives smaller YouTubers some time to grow their channels.  I'm so excited for you Lilly! Do what you feel you need to do to keep up the good vibes! We'll be here when you start up again. :)
Lilly.. We know you. Continue with your break, sweetie
Wow 😮 love you 😍 Lilly and thank you so much for sharing your story and fellings
Lily's makeup looks so good here.ohhh do a makeup tutorial 😭

You always inspired me...❤❤❤ love you Lilly😊❤
I am so happy now.cos Just watching you doing this many things in past just chokes me.I am happy about your decision
but the top 10 highest paid youtubers were still male
Good job Lilly! These are great changes to make. Thank you for your positive vibes and inspiration!
Everyone talking about how she said Lilly instead of Superwoman - she does that when she wants to get real with us and be serious.
Me? Excited about these changes!
Lilly? Beautiful 
Hotel? Trivago
Lilly you have no idea how amazing it feels when you say you love youre fans

Greets from the Netherlands😁
you are such an inspiration. whenever i feel sad or without motivation to continue i either watch some of your vlogs or rewatch some of your videos or i just open your book and read a chapter. i'm so glad that you found new energy and i support your changes <3 love ya
Geeeez ILY too much
I just had a surgery and honestly, superwoman, Kyutie, Wengie and BTS are my hope ❤️❤️
Love you Lilly 💞💕💖
JUST BE HAPPY LILY WE LOVE YOU!
Feels like she's going trough a tough time... She looks tired/exhausted (maybe depression) and it feels like she's trying really hard to be happy... Something about her feels off
I love your content, especially the ones involving Indian parents. I've always believed YouTubers are fake but yours is so authentic and genuinely hilarious. Keep up your good work, chakde phatte lol.
Plz make my parents reacting to money - cardi b 
Those who agree plz hit like button 👍 👍 👍 it will be a great fun guys
It's fine, Lilly! We're just excited you're back!! 😁😁😁
Yaaayyy you're back, seeing you happy makes me happy too I was feeling relived the entire video because how comfortable and happy you looked. Very excited for whats coming on 🌋😝🙌
the music gave me old superwoman vibes cuz im an og fan (lol) and now i feel warm inside, idk why is it just me?
Dont be so mean in the comments guys. Show some kindness. You dont have to understand everything in order to be nice to someone.

Lilly, you do you :)
):)

You decide

Your energy is great
Even though I’m really sad we’re not gonna get
To see Lilly as much I am so happy for her! What
She said about breathing and taking a break makes
Total sense and I think every YouTuber should do that too!
U know I was was a little shook when she said lily instead of superwoman and when she said uploads on the main channel once a week, but I’m happy that ur happy with ur decision! And also wanting to take ur time and give us better content. (Don’t know how’s that’s possible cuz it’s already bawse, but🤷‍♀️) happy for u lily and best of luck! Also plz recycle♻️👌🏻😀

Quality over quantity 💪🏼
So happy to see you being genuinely happy and excited about youtube again❤️❤️you’re the reason i started making youtube videos and I’m so glad that you still have that passion. You inspire millions,Lilly🦄

MISSED YOU so much
Deisel Patchel will make another video about this👀
No wait! What happened to superwoman! 😭😭
It's our girl, Lilly! 💗💗💗
I'm just glad your back!!
IN A NUTSHELL..




basically saying she will upload less
Before I say anything I am a huge fan I am team super here like #TeamSuper but anyway I love Lilly but I kinda miss the old hat wearing, unicorn loving, simple Lilly who was relatable and a little but vulnerable
She just makes you want to get up and try again for yourself  ❤️  Thank you, Lilly ❤️🌻
We 100% support you and your channel changes.💯 😃😁 
Being a youtuber (I’m a small youtuber😃) is tough so take your time.
Excited about the change I love you 😘
I love you and I want to say that you can be intelligent and not get new ideas that often.
bro, you are doing amazing no matter what so you do you, I love it either way.
Is your P.O box still the same bc I wanna send you something that I painted
did she change her intro imaged
This person is truly the less genuine person of this plataform
So happy to see you happy 😁
Hey guys I know everyone's criticizing Lilly but honestly, guys chill. We don't need to get so personal about this Lilly is a good person, okay? 
To Lilly: Stay strong girl!! Love u! <33
Lilly I love you and I get what you're talking about... You're killing it, queen ❤
Lilly taking the Higa path.
Hopefully more creators make videos like them.

Exactly how we feel about our channel we need a rework with content as well. It’s nice seeing others go through it also. Good luck with it all
She’s so obnoxious omg😂😂
Good to see a YouTuber who wants to give their 100% best and not spew unoriginal content for ad revenue 
Props to ya xx
Time:  0.11. You have a palatal tori .
I love you Lilly😘 I'm feeling so happy lately 🙂😊
You look much happier, Lilly 😊! It’s evident from your excitement, I’m very happy for you! All the best for this New Year!!! 💞💝💓 👐🏾
in her past video she said she might call her self Lilly it is really happening
Hi !

sham idrees says ur my family
and lily is saying team|ppl
I miss the old content
"Imma say Lilly"...
So because it looks serious I try to understand English (hardly) And Ithink I should just mute it......
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, My dear ate Lilly~
We love youuu no matter what
“What’s up its your girl lily” 

Me:😮
The way she has changed is so disappointing. Now she’s going even further down this high end road. Sad.
Your courage inspires me!!!
Love you Lilly keep doing what you love and everyone will keep watching
37 ON TRENDING!!!!!
You've got my full support
When she said it’s ur gurl Lilly I was like waaaaaaaaaaaaaa


Edit: I meant the mistakes
Cool it’s so nice to know that you are always gonna like your videos COME GET ME 2019
Honestly,I'm happy to see that Lily's going to start uploading less to focus on the quality of her content.I've never really been her number one fan,but I'd enjoy a video of her's from time to time,which I can't say about her recent uploads.I know she has potential to improve and I definitely don't think she deserves all the hate she's getting
Just...



STAY THE SAME
She said “Whatup everyone it’s your girl Lilly” and I’m tearing up 😭 ef PMS
Oh my gosh I freaking love u you are my model you are amazing 🥰😍
you go girllll❤️❤️
Change is always good! Keep Doing what you're doing!
Her eyes look so sad.
I love one thing that I can download every  video and watch it whenever I want
thank you for doing this video.
I’m so proud of you we’re in this together and i’m forever your fan ily
Why you changing your channel
💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
You go girl🔥👍
Lily honey don't get angry or sad by any negativity..just relax your mind and believe in the power of positivity 😍😍
Her energy feels recycled
i'm excited for this. it's been 7 years since i found out about you. here's to another 7 more 💘
When you said "it's your girl Lilly" I HAVE NEVER CLICKED THE MINIMIZE BUTTON SO FAST !!!!
I don’t get why people are freaking g out because she said Lily. When she said Lily I felt rly happy inside.
I remember the old "types of..." Videos... Havest seen a vid on this channel since.
I love you Lilly ❤❤
Don't care
I was 9 when I saw lily's channel first and by the changes I am shook
Hi your the best youruber
LOLY SONGH!!!😂😂
so excited for more creative videos from you , lilly! 💜
Take your time, don't burn out..
We are here for you Lilly. Watching in our studios in Nairobi, KENYA
Lily Singh is the perfect example of turd being valued as gold
Even though I've always appreciated her content, I also thought she posted too much, like she bombarded us with too much that she kind of bored me. So I understand her now posting whenever she has bomb videos. I see she doesm't want to do that "superwoman" greeting anymore so she probably still doesn't feel up to that word "Super". Anyways wishing her the best  hoped she like or replied to youtube comments here and there.
You were on bizardvark oh and I love you, you are so cool
lol i met you in Burnaby at chapters. i was the one in the blue jays hat
colab with brent rivara
Hey Lilly, I know you have been superwoman for a long time and maybe you feel a responsibility to be always happy and hyper and "super". But for me it seems like a persona that you're playing because that's what's been working for the success of your channel.

I wouldn't mind videos where you aren't acting out this persona and yelling and making weird noises and being fake in front of the camera for your viewers because it feels off. 

If I am mistaken and this energetic personality in the videos is not an act, I don't mean to offend you, it just feels acted to me. Best wishes for your future success regardless.
Forget the haters, I love you and that's all that matters. You're such an incredible person and an amazing role model. I look up to you in so many ways and I can't WAIT for you to absolutely KILL it in 2019
1:05 So basically, it's communism.
Where is the love button? I would've slammed it so hard.
I’m so happy for you Lilly and it’s important to us for you to being happy and sending happiness and good vibes to us ❤️ ONE LOVE LILLY ❤️❤️
Can't wait!!! 😍 EXCITED!
This channel changed 2 years ago...
wait, hold up! what did I miss?! why no more "superwoman"?
So what I’m hearing is....she won’t be posting for another...Month.
With you all the way.
❤❤❤❤❤
She needs a break.
love yourself. keep creating
bursts thru wall IM SORRY IM LATE I-oh wait im not late for once :/. Well whatever changes you make ill still love you and your channel!

Lily:It's your girl LILY
Me:*backs against wall* pulls out weapon WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE DONE WITH LILY'S INTRO
I’ve been following you since 2013 and I ABSOLUTELY loved your channel, it was my FAVOURITE channel and you are my favourite person. I watched every single one of your vlogs. However, the last year or two, I sort of watched you on and off and just wasn’t as excited anymore. Now, I’m back and I’m READY to fall in love with your videos all over again.
Anyone else here from trending but you don't even watch this channel & you were just here for the tea
Yaaaay! Goodbye 2018 Hello 2019
New Year,New Beginning,New Lilly
i don’t think all these 8 year old lilly stans understand that she is:
1. faking happiness 
2. making unfunny content
Lilly I can’t believe your changing superwoman but you do you boo. 

Also you should consider like cutting your hair shoulder length it looks amazing on you. Plus you could send your hair off to be made into a wig. Or just buy a shoulder length wig
Wow this is really nice to see. I’ve been here since the types of ...  videos and it’s beautiful to see you blossom and grow like this. This channel is not dying, but like a phoenix from the ashes it will rise anew, better, healthier.
Wow we can obviously tell that you’re more energetic. I can literally see your inner unicorn
This was so amazing and I think it's good she's not putting to much pressure on her she deserves a break every once in a while ily 💕💜💙💕💜💙💕💜💙💕💜💙
Honestly lilly, you videos really help me. I really love watching your videos, and the calm me down when I'm freaking out. Whatever changes you make, I know everyone will support you. I think we all of happy however this channel changes. I honestly love you, and will support you no matter how this changes.
Mass produced fake enthusiasm.
Delete your YouTube account please
I really love you I have been following you since the age of seven and i am now 13. Best of luck
Oiii lilly good work
Lilly I've been watching you since last 2 years.. I love your videos...
I make youtube videos too. Check out here #vppubg
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY YES
This sounds awesome!! Just want u to enjoy making your videos as much as we love watching 'em ❤️
(Quick! Think of something clever!)


Pineapples
Shane is inspiring everyone to make stuff they are passionate about!! :')
Who’s here before 1 million views?
Intro is 101% cringy
so are you gonna do like what swoozie does? upload a video once a month but the video will still be fire. if so, I'm okay with that
What ever you do we are always there with you 
Just waiting for your next video what all changes are there

The vlogs channels design is great and that way I am very excited for the next video 

😊😊😊😊
We’re so proud of you Lilly! You are doing what’s best for you and we will love everything you post whenever you post them. 😊 Happy New Year!
I like the intro .
This video is amazing #teamsuper
I HAD TO RECHECK HER CHANNEL NAME JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT HER NAME WAS STILL ‘IISUPERWOMANII’
Love your videos!!!! ❤️❤️
And we love you. God bless.
Patch notes 2.01:
Lilly I am sad that you are only posting once a week but it’s your health that matters so u support you ❤️❤️and also love you
I missed you Lilly !!!
For anyone commenting that there's something off with Lilly or that she's not the one that you used to know: ⬇
People grow, people change and that's something that is very normal. She's growing up and figuring out what she wants to do with her life and she has a right to choose whatever thinks is the best for her and most importantly what makes her happy. I think people in general should be less judgemental and more supportive once they notice a positive change  in someone's behavior. Let's all relax and leave Lilly live the best of her life. All she needs from us is to be there for her and support her throughout her journey.
Much love to Lilly and to all of you there unicorns. 💙
I was soo triggered when she said lilly
Lily I’ve seen a lot of hate in the comments, but I wanna say your awesome and I appreciate your videos so muchhhhhhh.
congralutations
You inspire me so much!
Love you lily also are u Punjabi or indan
Best decision.I am so proud of you. But why not "one love superwoman" ?!
Never sell 23andme ever again there trying to sell my spit sample for 10000 $
To all the mean people who are commenting on her medical student attire: Why are you making her poor by calling her a medical doctor? She is already a millionaire who can easily hire doctors and pay them a decent salary.
#teamsuper one love lily that is a rap and zoop
Wish you the best :)
I miss Lilly’s old apartment
you go girl!!
Lilly.... I love you... please take care... you're the inspiration and you're really out there trying to help people...but be Happy too... love you so much..
Wait that means no more superwoman🤔
I'm like I want to have a conversation with this so talkative Superwoman
Love U Lilly😚
congrats on coming Out
I have Only been watching you for 2 years, but you are like my second Mother. I am growing up to believe that women are Bawses,  Happiness is the most important thing for anybody and that no one should ever stop that, and Unicorns (like You Lily) are absolutely real.💕💕
he is cannon this background!! 🤩
even Cheers and MASH and Friends had to come to an end. Me think this is her "Jump the Shark" moment
"Practoce what you preach" humph
We love u ♥️♥️
I used to love her... but she is not the same superwoman i used to look up to. She is trying too hard to be relevant which is not her.
It’s hard to laugh at this channel..
Why anti superwoman now? Like I want an explanation as to why she keeps putting Lilly everywhere
Live footage of me practicing my fake smiles and laughs when school starts tomorrow.
She looks so genuinely happy, this is amazing
Agree that you have worked really really hard and 2 videos a week not to mention daily vlogs is too much lily. Happy to know that now you have more time for yourself. I appreciate all the energy you bring to us, it is so inspiring but I cant be 100% happy watching you kind of exhausted inside. Take a break and I will always support you. Superwoman (you deserve the title)
So happy to have you back. Proud of you putting yourself first and taking that time for self-care. Such a good message 🙏🏻
LOTS OF LOVE FROM Taiwan... LILY..my English not good but I have loved u very long time..n Always waiting for ur notification...Its ohk Take a break n come back with a BANG 🤗
I'm so happy for you, Lilly, and I cant wait to see what you create this year.
Can you do another types of people videos I miss those ❤️
lilly will always have a special place in my heart, been watching since 2014, but maybe a year after the move to la, her content just started to disappoint me, so i began looking forward to the vlogs bc i really just love her as a person, but now the vlog channel is like... idk. hopefully we’ll get back to our roots. the older videos are still my favs, and im looking forward to lilly creating projects she is passionate about. it will show, i know it, because i remember those days. like do any og team supers remember the 300 video? like that was before her huge team and everything lol
What happened to superwoman?
Im getting like a weird fouseytube Vibe right now...
I may be a little late but CONGRATS ON 14M!!!!
Wow she really had me shook when she said “it’s your girl, Lilly”
Idc how you call yourself on here, you'll always be my superwoman!! ❤
Awesome! Did you finally decide to come out?

Lilly Singh is about love, acceptance, and inclusion. Except if you're a straight, white person.
What a change to start the year, I am a bit freaked out, but I know in the end it will benefit you, and we all what nothing more then for you to be happy and feel good what you are doing. Love you so much and have a great 2019  🦄💜
My mom won’t let me take a breather from school
I read This Channel is Charging 😎because that’s what this channel does ... You spread a lot a lot of positive charging out there in the universe 🌍
Lilly you are one of my favorite youtubers to watch i love you and i believe you should be happy so please do whatever it is that makes you happy, healthy, and just your normal self.
I'm happy that she's happier but superwoman I felt empowered her and people around her, it has that authenticity and Lilly doesn't have the same effect,,
Hey guys whats up its your girl lilly
Me:Da heck!?!?!?!?
about time sis
I need a break and i only have a few followers. 🤪 it’s good to see you back! ❤️
I’m so proud of you Lily!
The last supper
Who came from diesel patches???
I just love you Lilly
Hi.....just a little reminder my librarian told me to.....

Read more
You are Lily.  You are Superwoman.  You are not fronting.  You are not stunting.  You have this amazing energy and vibe about you that only gets better as you express yourself.  Burnouts can happen as a content creator or any kind of creator.   This is your family, but even with the positive/negative comments and suggestions, at the end of the day, you gotta do you and I truly believe you show every spectrum of you.  Stay my hero.  Stay UNDEFINED!!!!!!
Love u lilly❤️❤️❤️
Looking foreword to your new start Lily💖💝 your awesome 😎 ❤️💖
Lilly, just remember that you are always going to be amazing. It doesn't matter how anyone feels about you. What matters is how you feel about yourself. I hope that you will keep smiling no matter what happens. We all love you very much. 💙
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I loooooove you I started watching u years and years ago I forgot how awesome ur channel is
MISSED YOU!
Ahhhhh you got on the trending page congrats girl
I don't see Justin Y. here.
Hmmm,  Why?
She is my SUPERWOMEN!!!👍
I really don’t mind that she uploads videos whenever she wants cause she is still a great, funny person!
I feel like Lilly and Letitia Wright would get along so well
(Me getting ready to say What up its your girl superwomen!).                                                                          "What up its your girl Lilly!" -Lilly
Me😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶
Still love you!
(And yes I know everyone has already said that but I couldn't)
Hmmm. Not too happy about the changes, but I'm your people, so we'll see how it goes.
Yep... It's all changed
......hmmm.......there's just something fake about this. Like she is trying to hard to remain positive

I hope she truly is getting better
All the best Lily!!!! We love you 😘
Hopefully it’s getting deleted
She gives me jojo siwa vibes
I’m so glad this isn’t a 20 min video, literally a lot of YouTubers make their videos so long when they have an announcement and it’s so annoying, that I for saving time😄👍
Now this kinda boosts me up! Thanks Lilly!
I love that Lilly is taking the time to feed her soul.  It's hard as a creator to be on a fixed schedule when things feel uninspired. I love that she's taking it a little easier! 👍
I'm honestly really happy that your doing this Lily. The entire time that I have watched you I always wondered how you can do all this without crashing. I'm really happy for you and support you 100%.
#TEAMSUPER
Woah this intro threw me off
I love you 🦄
So inspiring so great
Lilly is this going to be marina joyce part 2?
haha am watching this on march 27th
14 Million strong, we aint going nowhere! Love you girl! Cant wait to see whats in store
"Your girl Lily"???!
Luv it 💖💖
You should do a “types of people who swear” like

The pain swearer- people who only swear in pain 

Overcuser- the one that cusses on almost every sentence 

The toddler- even tho this kid is basically a toddler they cus SO MUCH

The private- when this guys parents are around they are an ANGLE But when they look away this kid becomes the star of an R Rated movie

No cus- this kid flat outs doesn’t like to cus others make fun of it but whatever 

The hot head- When you make this guy mad... Just don’t  god please don’t There a literal F Bomb so don’t light the fuse

You can change the names or not use them there just examples not sure if you can tell but I put a lot of effort into this even for a 12 year old
new year, new you! Love it!
Thank god you are recognising what you need to do to feel better 👌🏽👑

Now to make sure you actually drink water thru the day 😂❤️🙌🏽
Somebody Is thirsty for views
I'm so used to saying "superwoman" with you when you say what up it's your girl, but I'm glad you're making changes to make yourself happier. I support you always girl <3
Anyone else missing Types of People?? (if you are and have a #DOPE idea for a types of people video, reply because honestly I've got nothing)
As a YouTuber grows, they upload less. Literally every channel follows this path. More brand deals, new companies, and more responsibilities outside of their channel. It's not a bad thing, it just means they're evolving past JUST uploading videos.
Who’s seeing this after Lily’s post on Instagram about her bisexuality
I get a dutch vibe from her
I watched you since I was 13, now I'm 17 almost 18,I watched how this channel grow and proud of you and your accomplishments.Glad to be in Team super!
You go Lilly!!!

3. spice news every other week!!
no matter what changes we love you lilly <3
29 Jan anyone
Happy for you, Lilly!!
I'm a relatively new follower of yours and I'm in the middle of a transition period in my own life.  Watching you overcome your own adversity has really been a source of comfort to me.  Keep going.  I'm with you.
I wanted to write some really inspirational comment but I'm tired and can't think straight so hi.
You look so sad from the inside we know your trying to be cheerful but you can tell us when ever you need to talk about something
Edit: when she said it’s Lilly I thought she was quitting YouTube
I miss the “What up everyone! It’s your gurrrrrrrrrrrl IISUPERWOMANII” I miss that, but I think I can eventually enjoy and get used to the “What up everyone! It’s yo gurlllllllllllll LILLY
im gong tell my mommy and do not go to skool for a breether thanks lily :)
Okay Lilly TBH I did stop watching you because I did feel like the videos was being rushed and they lacked the Superwoman aspect so I can not wate to see this new chance!!
“Ya girl lily” the channel has changed 🤧
We all support you don't worry if you are happy then I'm happy 😊
I’m so proud of this community....
I didn't even watch the video yet and ive already liked...
Translation: I CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH CRITICISM IN A WEEK
the last time i saw this channel changing was in 2018
Even if you are Lilly you will always be our IISuperwomanII
Me aapke channel ki dibani hi
Please mam mere channel ko grow krne me mera support kre
Make a types of students video
LOVE YOU SO MUCH!
Story times please 😘😘😘😘🤓😎😎
Why is she not calling herself 'SUPERWOMAN' anymore?! She definitely is Super! She is an inspiration to women & men all over the world. Being Super doesn't mean being Perfect.
@Lilly Singh, you defeat your demons and rise above your flaws. Own it. For your us. If you don't call yourself Super, how can we be Team Super? You are SUPERWOMAN!

P. S. Love from India.. aspiring to come to Canada!
#teamsuper
What could be more fun in 2019 tht lilly spreads positive vibes and good vibes...n for me i'd still watch previous videos and laugh crazy till your new uploads....one love lilly.
I didnt realize people could dictate how many times a week they are inspiring.  Wow, that's nice to know....
Felt like a... bad video. Hoped more the person behind her over-enthusiastic and positive character. *STAY POSITIVE, BE HAPPY!!!*
Hmph...sellout.
Lily was soaring at one point and for whatever reason, is not doing so well right now. Let's say that even if it is completely her fault, it takes a tremendous amount of courage and positivity to keep trying. To just wake up everyday, and keep trying harder, and keep pushing, though your efforts used to give you better results. For those who think this video had fake positivity, I appeal to you to just appreciate her TRYING to keep being afloat, take care of herself and her mental health and encouraging others to do the same. Many could turn sour and bitter at their audience or fans for not supporting them anymore, instead, she remains grateful and positive and that takes a lot of effort and maturity.

Take care of yourself Lily, I hope in 2019. you find happiness, peace and creativity.
We got your back girl.
hey I really your channel please my answer my commet
:( tbh pls take care of yourself.
I feel like it's still 2018.
Why so many negative comments on this video, I genuinely don’t get it? 🥺
i thought this video was sarcastic and was a joke because i've been watching nigahiga too much recently. oh well.
I cant take a breather school wont let me parents wont let me life wont let me 😵😬😩😫😪😭
Can you please say in your intro ,,Superwomen "
Lillyyyyyyyyyy you the bestttttttttttt girlllllllllllll ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This was really hard to watch. Such unfunny and fake expressions. It's 2019, grow with your audience or you'll continuously lose them daily
More racism I hope!!! Laughing at your logic usually warms my heart :)))
Lilly GO TO IBIGHIT!!! IBIGHIT HAS A SECOND BOYBAND AND THEY ARE CALLED TXT AND THEY POSTED 2 MEMBERS😄
The only clarity I want is to know if my dad is coming back or not
You go gurl 🦄🌈💜💜
Every time I look at you I remember Cardi B because you are looking just like her😍😍😍😍
Prolly cause you got so much hate.
Why didn’t she say superwoman
Live long..and be happy
Dad: you should be a teacher
Me: No
Dad: why not
Me: because I hate school right now you think I'm going back after college
Dad: well than what else could you do
Me: I have skills I could be a author a YouTuber a artist
Dad: you need a backup you have almost no chance of being successful
Me: ouch that hurts
Sssniperwolf: "we need doctor Phill"
The video looks a bit forced. If you need more break. Just take it. Do what needs to be done to be loved by yourself again so we can love you back. Because this forcing positivity is not sending any good vibes to us. YouTube helped you when you were in a depression. Maybe it will again, but not like this.
we understand everyone needs a break u need to focus on  yourself ok so no hard feeling 
we will miss u a lot but how long can u keep making videos so take care , we all will always 
be with u
Please keep superwoman for team super !!!
I'm glad you're making this change Lilly because everybody needs a change in life! And change always has its downs to begin with but in a long term perspective it is so worth it.
Hey, why'd you changed "superwoman" to Lily?
Hey I’m 19 and I was actually 13 when I first found you. “Why I Can’t Sleep At Night” was the first video I saw of you and it still makes me laugh every time I watch it. I’ve been subscribed  to you ever since (I wasn’t allowed to get a gmail account till high school but I was subscribed in spirit) and I have loved seeing you grow and develop into someone huge and motivated to hustle to bring success and spread love. I’m so proud of you in every way. Also you really helped me through some really lonely and dark nights as well as just develop as a person. I love you so much and I just want you to be as happy as possible. Do what’s best for you.
Who else remembers the Lilly sing storybooth?
Every one has ups and downs . You will get through it . Your channel will do good again . All the best
More like your channel is dying
She's cautiously yet intentionally avoiding the tag #Superwoman, albeit just praying for more positive vibes for a serene person like LILLY and more happiness showered onto her !
I'm excited to see what's going to be in store for 2019! I think that these changes will be good for the channel, and allow you to express your creativity.
Can you do another video with the rock
OUR GIRL IS BAAAACCCCKKKKK
I don't understand why most people are accusing Lilly of being over enthusiastic...... she's just being her true self.She's just the same as in her old videos....love u Lilly!!!! Keep going.
I love Lilly's hair! Like the comment if you agree!
It’s just that Lilly used to be so relatable and suddenly everything is a schedule and a hustle. 
To me when I watch YouTube I don’t expect people to show me their projects  and hard work I want to laugh feel inspire and forget about my problems for a little bit...I don’t care as much about quality or SOMETIMES not even about the content of a video ( I watch Jeffree star reviewing stuff that I will never buy all day 😂)  it’s that when someone is genuine you feel connected and it flows without trying so hard.
Oh yeah yeah
Types of people at McDonald's
Just bye good luck 10 seconds in
IDK why everyone is being so mean to her.  Lilly, i just wanna give you a really tight hug. You don't have to force things, do what you like and makes you genuinely happy, not what you ought to do.  We're always here for you. Take care of yourself and come back when you're feeling good GENUINELY.
Waiting for CommunityChannel to make a video.
that's why i love you sooo much
Hey lily can do vid about high school because I am going to high school in a couple of months and I asked you because you help my confidence so pls
“Quitting YouTube”. on trending
Lilly's channel is dying... Its making me sad 😢
#GoodVibesOnly!! ❤️💛💚👍🏽
*hits thumbs up before any of lily’s videos start*
I miss paramjeet and manjeet
nah, you're not lilly. you're iisuperwomanii :(
Lilly, just be yourself. We like YOU.
Love you Lilly
you go gurrrrrl
Tbh for the past two years I’ve been having a hard time watching her videos because they don’t seem real anymore and I feel bad because I love her so much they just don’t feel as genuine and funny anymore  it just feels so scripted and forced these days I know that she always has had a script for her videos (ik this from her older vlogs) but you really couldn’t tell. Tbh I liked her videos  when she was in front of her video wall and her camera  cuz it felt real i understand that she has said that filming her own videos was not enjoyable to her.  I then just resulted to watching her vlog channel but then that was not feeling right either then I watched her older vlogs like 2014 vlogs and that’s where it felt genuine in my opinion becauseI don’t know what was going on behind the scenes and I felt like she was being herself and I saw how hard she worked to become the superwoman she is now thats why I have mixed feelings even writing this comment. 
She is so pretty.
Been following you since I was 11, I’m 16 now. Growing with you has been the most exciting thing ever. I can’t wait to see what 2019 will bring you ❤️
she is me being clinically depressed but i needa put on an act
Is it just me...or does lilly look exhausted...
Hi!Where did u buy a top from maroon 5 video?I love it!:*
I really appreciate these changes and I'm in full support but... don't just say "LILLY" at the intro and outro! 
YOU REALLY ARE SUPERWOMAN!!! Acknowledge that fact!
We love you a lot! 💕
If you aren't SUPER, then how will we be #TeamSuper ??
I hate that we are so quick to judge :(. Be kind to her guys, she is only a human, after all. 🙏🏽
Like this if superwoman is a KWEEN
Hey Lily! It's alright. You'll do great. Everything's gonna be okay. We'll all be okay. I don't think anyone needs to tell what depression is all about but take your time. I'm sure that one day you'll find peace with yourself.
Happy new year, Lily! I love the positive vibes here & celebrate your creativity!
Hey Lily or should I say Superwomen!!!! Thx for loving us!!!
We're so proud of you! So excited to see your new content! ❤😍
To me it's fine if you ship as long as you don't try to affect the artists in any way like celebrating Jenkai's breakup is just plain RUDE.
I don't really think anyone should be uncomfortable about the photoshop pics because you can easily avoid them.
i'm so happy that you're happy again! so glad you finally understand that you need time to yourself. can't wait for what 2019 Lilly has in store.
Are you sure it was a BREAK?
do you girl show your true self
Happy National Women Day!
ThIs ChAnNeL iS cHaNgInG!!!1!!1
You go girl!
I love this message, such good moto for yound kids watching
I see like 9 ppl saying first.... y'all know something is wrong here 😂 (ILY LILLY)

I was born on sept27
But more late
I mean the intro. It could be better if u use superwoman. Just say..
Yooi your video
We love u lily
Hey lillgh could you do one more video of your parents reacting to music videos.
If so could they react to CNCO Prince Royce or maybe you could react to them.(they are a spanish group)
The official end of IISuperwomanII :(
Like Higa
Damn people need to chill
I will always support Lilly
Love your  videos
before watching i was thinking the change would be manjeet and paramjeet taking a permanent vaccation
I love you so much!!!!
oh honey, forget all the rude comments. You know better. Do whatever makes you happy. WE LOVE YOU.
*hi*   hi   hi  (this is a test)
Wow, what a breather.
When her fame fades out, which will happen eventually, I want to see how she ends up.
The shirt looks like a restaurant uniform
Lily. U r awesome.. But u should never need to fight for your happiness. Just do what makes u happy.. With love from South Africa
Im proud to be a subscriber and Im Excited for a new beginning
My girl superwoman is back ❤️ gurrrlllll we missed you
walking into 2019 like 0:01
GO LILLY!!!
ok so basically
at the very start of the vid when lilly walks in side ways u can see her hair and i thought that that was one change she made THAT SHE CUT HER HAIR like it looked like she did and i started freiking out. did no one else SEE IT? ik she didnt but man that heart attack i had
Gurl please
Last time I was this early I was in 2018
You should do a video with the boy bad PrettyMuch
Another self conflating upload where you regurgitate the 'i wanna be challenged' mantra. Yeah, step away from the low hanging fruit with zero substance & delete your channel, thank you.
You gotta accept the fact that people exude energy across a spectrum. Just because your energy is in the middle of the spectrum doesn't mean someone that exudes higher energy than you is faking. This is how she is. Energetic.
Supporting you through all of it!
If your a small youtuber keep grinding on youtube even if you get small views. They gonna see you shine one day🙏🙏🙏
2:12 "loly songh"
I love your parents 😂
HELLO SUPERWOMAN I LOVE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS EVERYDAY AND I ALSO LIKE IT TOO AND I ALSO THINK YOUR SO PRETTY AND BEAUTIFUL AND AWESOME AND AMAZING AND  FUNNY AND COOL TOO OKAY LILLY 💚💙😎
Who else is tired of this channel?
I love that you're changing and doind what makes you happy but superwoman? Why can't you still be superwoman? 😢
Wasn't her "break" to take care of her mental health just to record the 12 christmas videos.
Subscribe to the AMAZING 'King Rexx'! Thanks guys 😉
I had a mini heart atttack when she didnt say superwoman
You know its changing when she says its lilly!.....
If it includes you taking a break and taking that “mental break” you said you would then go ahead
we will always support you. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE VIDEOS💕
You do you Lilly! Happiness is key ☺️👍🏾
This channel is changing into a corpse. That Alicia Keys collab video could not even manage to hit a million views yet after three weeks. Social blade bleeding out in the red too, yikes!
That smile, I've missed it. Welcome back Lilly
SO EXCITED
My mom watched one of your videos about how to annoy people and literally she was laughing so bad 🤣and if you made my mom laugh then you are the funny legend love u so much by the way
i clicked in a heartbeat
I don’t think YouTube is for her anymore..
I thought she said It's your girl superwoman not Lilly
Hi Lilly, I know you probably won't see this but as a long time fan of yours, I wanted to express my concern. It seems (this is from my point of view only and as an audience member's point of view, keep in mind) like you are forcing yourself to be enthusiastic and happy in your most recent videos. Whether that is actually what you are doing or not, I don't know because obviously, we don't get to see all that is happening when the camera isn't on. If that's not the case, then I think you should be aware that's how some of your audience has been perceiving you lately. I'm not trying to be hateful in any sort of way, but I do think you should keep that in mind.  
I've noticed a huge change not only in you, but your content as well over the years. Though, I think your editing and filming skills are amazing and definitely shows in your work, the script and the personality just isn't there anymore. When I watch your old videos (Abt 2015 and older), I love and appreciate how raw, funny, and genuine those were. I remember seeing a video in the recent past, talking about how you were frustrated with when the videos you like to make don't get a lot of views, but ones that are crazy, have a catchy title and thumbnail get tons of views. Unfortunately, that's just how it works on YouTube but instead of getting caught up in that, I would love to see you go back to what YOU like creating. When you created videos that you actually enjoyed making, we could see that joy on camera. Now it seems like you create just to get views (Which may not be the case but remember, this is just from my point of view). 
Yes, maybe the videos you like to create don't get as many views as ones that are clickbaity, but in the end if you think about it, the numbers don't matter. It's better to have viewers that enjoy watching your true personality and what you enjoy making, than people who clicked on your video just because it's popular, clickbaity, extreme, etc. A.K.A.The people who support you for being yourself rather than a persona.
Basically what I'm trying to say is that, we want you to be yourself and we want you to create what you love to create. Whether it's posting two times a week or two times a month, does not matter to me. As long as we see a happy, healthy, and truly enthusiastic Lilly, that's all that really matters :) xoxo & zoop
We like you here in South Africa...well atleast i know I DO. ;)
I'm so happy that you're happy Lilly! You deserve it! Thank you for all of your hard work and good time, best of luck for the future!!!
The first half of the video: you can only take time to relax to be happier if u rich cough YouTube money so she could take a break
There are so much verified people here lol
Dear lily remember HATERS ARE MOTIVATERS so read all dem hate comments it might help you in some way :)
We are all totally behind you on this Lilly, we are all here to stay.
This was in the making...
Ur not funny 😂
As long as you’re happy, I’m happy x
Ohhhh FINALLY. CHANGE. 
It's a good thing. I promise.
You are my fav Youtuber /  Creator / Writer / Superwoman <3
Omg I am so happy I'm part of team super 😄😘 I love you Lilly you're  so awesome you're awesome no matter what you do
Never clicked so fast in my life!!!
I love you Lilly
I like the changes, you're gonna surprise us with new vids and you won't get crazy from hustling too hard
Take your time sis, be the best version of you and do everything necessary for your happiness. Love you ❤️
This was in the making...

Hhmmmmmmmm🤔
love her & she inspires me so much with my channel 💛✨
That's great! Hope these changes work out for you. SCARBRO AND THE FANS SUPPORT YOU.
She has definitely changed... sigh I guess that’s how youtube works
In her last video I was thinking she should say "what up guys it's a girl Lilly Singh" in her intro was literally so close to that!!!
Read a little too fast and thought it said “dying” and I was like “yeah, we know.”
I like your YouTube channel
Grow with your audience make videos about you like conquering your fears baking your favorite dish 
Try to do comedy that is more situational than Instagramy
I’m not here to hat I love you ❤️ but you need a change in style and character
7 views and 1.6k comments? YOUTUBE YOU LOST?
I just think your having trouble realizing that your audience grew up, if you ask them, what appeals to them now, I think you will do great!
i just wanted to say that even tho im 11 yrs old i also have a lot of stress not only that but my life is also a huge MESS because im suffering from heartbreak, anxiety and depression and i will take what u said and i am gonna take a breather thx u lilly i luv u so much <33333
I miss her old content
Honestly sometimes I just to this channel, scroll back a few years and watch the videos that truly inspired me.
You go gurll!!!
✨✨✨✨lilly
She had 16m subscribers and now she has 14m
I get this is all supposed to be new but I think the mood was a little wierd😳😞but I still love u❤❤💙💙
랩하시나
Lily I agree with you  strongly and I support you all the way through but please just please don't change your intro in your outro I'm begging you
I think the reason I subbed the first time a couple of years ago was cause of ur eyes and how raw u were. Had no clue you were 30. After u bashed Christians in that homophobia video, that's when I unsubbed. I hope to god uv grown since then cuz I really used to like ur content. But that video was no not okay 🤧🤧
I'm dying and sinking and I'm trying too hard to stay relevant
It’s sad to see so much hate in the comment section tbh. Yes, she does seem a bit fake but that’s understandable. But how tf is she “cringey” and “boring” now? Her videos have gone downhill because she was probably stressed and uncreative at the time. Give her some time to think and now that she doesn’t have such a forced schedule, she will do better. Plus, what do you want her to do except be happy? Mope in front of the camera and be depressed?
Lily has also helped so many girls gain access to education, and has done so many more things with her fame. 
Having said that, I do want to say that I know something’s off. I feel like Lily’s break was too short, and I kinda hoped she would’ve taken more time. :/
I love u lilly
who cares about being cool it's about talent 😇
Why is she getting so much hate I don't understand I think it's great she's taking a different approach to her channel
you go girl
You’re such an inspiration. Thanks for sharing lovely! We love your channel.
So basically nothing is changing... wow so surprised.
Look at the upside down cross on her shirt she a sale out or a clone
Omg who care?
Why is this on trending?
Lol this is like me when I went from working myself so hard I caught pneumonia twice to working so hard I only caught pneumonia once😂😂
Who else got the song Girls Like You  as a ad on Magic Tiles 3 Piano
I ask some people in my house what are changes they making in 2019
I’m so happy you’re happy. It’s a new day, a new Lilly. There’s a new vibe coming from you and I am FOR IT. Thank you
She forced the positivity. And it reminded me of fuseytube. And look where he is now.
will u react to leja re..plllllllllease?
What's up it lily 😲
So it’s 2019 now?!?! I hope everyone has set goals this year and gonna make everyone happen! One of my goals is to hit 4K, so any support is appreciated!!💙❤️ if not a like on the comment would go a long way!👊
I love this!
Cool, but can you just focus on humor and not what you have to say about something that causes drama, I think your really funny and a lot of your videos get taken different ways so you be you and keep it positive
Wow these comments are so harsh. Even if someone is depressed y'all just make it worse
I cant believe that one of the youtubers I wacth is one trending, pretty cool.
This channel is slowly losing views idk why
love Superwoman's channel yaaaassss Lilly she's super pretty
Good for you beautiful, I'd rather quality over quantity and I feel like this for my whole life. Like I'd rather have a few real people than many, I'd rather have a few hobbies that really do it for me than many that sorta do so glad you're doing this for yourself, your content life etc too. Much love.
This video has quadrupled my respect for you. It was anyways pretty high to begin with :) but so wonderful to see this brilliant happiness self check of yours for 2019. Our world needs more Lilys! This video is so inspiring, clear and filled with white light-I don't know why but it is! Love it and can't wait for your dope ideas whenever they come to you..love your style of presentation, love that you took time off to introspect and make a list of  what makes you happy .. I think it's the most enriching  video I've seen on your channel. You go girl ❤️
I can see the fake enthusiasm and happiness..
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy can i have a shoutout on my sc ayshali.15
(Does 12 days of collabs) this vid: "I took a little bit of a breather" bish where 😩😱
Love it!!
I think she needs a break from YouTube right now
1 view and 500 comments 😂
even though you wont be posting every week Im really happy that you are happy.
Oh you don't love me so you are a liar
I look forward to watching this video
As long as you are happy :)
Hi lilly been watching you for years and your videos always cracked me up SO much especialaly as a brown gitl myself. Loved how you speak and sing in tamil as well. 
I'm sure you've read the comments on how lately it hasn't been like that and if it helps,all the vommenrs come from a good place. People loved you and your content but it's drifted off course recently. It's become unrelateable and more like white people or spoilt brat problems. What made you unique (your cultural identity) is no longer there. And maybe since you dont live with your parents anymore the content with manjeet and paramjeet has also gotten less funnier. The characters have become caricatures of themselves and are over exaggerated. 

Maybe REALLY takr a break,go on holidays and sre the world and do (less enthusiastic or loud yelling) videos on your experiences. One of my favs of your channel was the why i am not getting married and the video on gun violence. You did such a range of vieos back then. And they were a riot. It's still in you. Maybe too many cooks spoil the broth? In any case hoep you are truly truly happy and at peace inside.
Yall are so harsh. She is aware something needs to change and this is just how she is processing everyone grows and takes things differently.
hello, anyone new youtubers? let’s support all each other!!🥰
good for you good for you you are the best love you
I like to see everyone fall off once in a while and then come talk to me when your more relatable
Thats what happens after 5 years of Mondays and Thursdays. Ay thats ok i agree with you lilly go ahead makes changes. and change your life... Little bit ours too 😄😘
The way she walked into the camera shot 😂😂😂
You seem so happy which makes us all happy ❤️
Wait lily your hair is shorter
New sub
i don't know... that would be great if for one video ... 
she can maybe leave the "superduperhappy" persona in the closet. 
Just for one video. Have a talk, a serious talk, a deep one, 
that make you feel things. 

I think they way she acted looked way to forced and fake.
The beginning is def my brain when I’m high asf
Everything started to change since she started collaborating videos with famous celebs rather than making single videos as before
Hi Lilly, have you ever been in Miami?
But.... you still haven’t posted on this channel for a month
🤘🏻🤘🏻
Happy new year :)
At least Smoshes video was worst
Now I know why!  I’m so excited!
Its your girl lilly?
I'm here from I'mallex
so... 2019 is the year of less work, because you're exhausted and you need some break. Well then ADMIT IT and do what you feel like doing. It's ok, I just want you to be honest with yourself. It could be a burnout..
Ahhhh just seeing her videos make me smile ear to ear!!! I’m so happy for you and I can’t wait for your new content!!!!! ;)
*dying
As long as you’re happy I’m happy
I've been watching your videos since I was nine years old. I was extremely happy at that time and I would walk around school, talking to my two friends, saying things like "whattup it's your guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurl SUPERWOMAN!!" and I would hold up the symbol with my fingers and I remember being so happy when I could do it perfectly without hesitation. I have been watching you for years, and I am so excited. Well, I say years, but around 2015-2019 (today) I've stopped watching your videos. I don't know how this came to be. I remember watching one of your videos and you were talking about Beyonce's lemonade album or something, and how poppy and happy you were on screen and that didn't seem real to me. Now when I look back, I realize I needed that poppy happiness. For the past four years, I have had no idea who I was, what I wanted, if I really enjoyed the things I believed I did, etc. I began to think darkly. This darkness took over my thoughts and my actions. I started listening to music that was dark and depressing. I still listen to them because their music inspires me and I realize that the music I listened to wasn't to keep me on the ground. It was supposed to say, "Look at me, look at what I have become. Look at what I have accomplished despite all of this. You can do it too, just...look for it." So yes, you being excited all the time felt like you were mocking my sadness, and I stopped watching it altogether and eventually I forgot. What I realize now is that I need your happiness. I need your excitement. I need that kind of support and love that I have in real life, but need on a much deeper and much personal level. You get me. You understand me. I don't think I could be this happy at this moment right now for another several years without you. Thank you and keep being excited and happy and even if you're not, I hope that you can see this and it can help you to keep doing amazing things. I know you probably will never read this or know that it exists, but hopefully, you will keep doing the absolute amazing things you've been doing and that you keep being amazing in general.
Fake it till ya make it
we love you lilly
TRENDINGGG
Wait so does she not want to be known as superwoman anymore??
Damm....... I thought it was going to be “this channel is dying”
Everyone, if u dont have something nice to say, say it at a wall. like we get the message that shes "faking enthusiasm" you dont have to keep saying it.
*dying
Fr this time?
will you stop lying, being a professional victim and obsessing over your relevancy this fine 2019? that’d be great 😉
한국인의 긍지 이 곳에선 있을까...
dont change the ONE LOVE SUPERWOMAN THAT IS A WRAP AND ZOOOOP pls dont....
It will be awesome.
I have been waiting for this video for a while. I litterely unsubcribed  until you made the vdeo becauce your vedios got repetitive and even you didn't look like you were enjoying making them. I asumed it was becuce you were trying to come out with 2 videos a week (you run out "of types of...." :D). But since your break I have loved your 2 new video and am happy that you are makking really cool content.
oh lord i thought this was going to be a video where there was no screaming... you proved me wrong thanks for making me deaf now i wont have to listen to this again
Why did I feel so emotional when you introduced yourself as Lilly? In all the best ways! I see you, girl! Reclaim your time, energy, and creativity on YOUR terms. You started this as an outlet for your creativity and the YouTube machine has put sooo many people under this pressure to perform when really, it’s about you making magic for you and those that you love. I am so happy and excited for you and sending you love!!!!
There is no me without you!! Positive Vibes, Good Energy, Inspiration, Inclusion,  Acceptance and Love are all things I am gonna try harder in! Thanks, Lilly!! Love ya so much!!❤❤
I love you
Have you noticed Lilly that you move your hands alot.....
Love you
×2   Eminim 😂😂
Lilly literally said to spread positivity and good energy and so many of these comments do the exact opposite. You cannot tell if someone is being fake in a video, especially if you don't know them personally. If Lilly says she's happy, then she is! I'm happy that she took a break and found out what she needed to in order to be a happier, healthier person. I'm so excited to see the content that she creates this year!
Bòooooooooooő
Why r people saying “ this feels forced.” She’s literally doing the same exact thing she did last year. I think ur just noticing it now. 

But I don’t mind it. Maybe that’s how she copes with whatever’s going on in her life rn.
“I will be uploading videos on this main channel whenever I have a dope idea”

Translation- I’m scrapping the barrel for content the now
If the highest aim of a captain were to preserve his ship, he would keep it in port forever. :)
Will their still have super 60
Oh yeah yeah
what?
Lilly don’t read the comments they toxic af
Hypocrisy is her definition
What happened.........ur not being the lilly we used to love where’s superwoman gone where’s the lilly that inspired us the one we look up to I miss that Lilly soo much I hope we can have our superwomen back.....😭😭😭😢😢😢😔😣😫😩🥺
Just sayin love you no matter what 💛💗
That first decision was the decision that i was waiting for i always thought that she did needed do that😘
It's funny how people disliked and commented without watching the video.
ONE LOVE LILLYYYYY!!! I love it, Self care and mental health are incredibly important and honestly - not that my little voice matter much - but so you know, As some one who has advocated for self love and care for the past 5 years - Lilly I am super duper proud and I can see the difference in your energy albeit small changes. You look like you love life again. Welcome back Queen!

IISuperwomanII 
IILilly SinghII
it isn't about what we want if she wants to focus on herself who are we to stop her
I’m crying right now because I just love you so much and I’m happy for you and I feel bad that I went so long without knowing you came out as bi. I feel soo bad but I’m so proud of you and I love you and I can’t wait to see your show. I have been watching since you were still living with your parents and you’ve grown so much and learned so much about your self and I feel like even tho I know a million thing that you will never know about me. I just want to say I feel we have grown together. 😢😭🥺😘🥰😍I LOVE YOU LILLY AND I HAVE NEVER EVER SPELT YOUR NAME WITH TWO L’s
I'm ready
Librarian are almost all same
The difference is she is independent and some are stuck inside cage.
At the start she usually says "what up its your gurl superwoman!!" 

This one started differently. When i really like a youtuber, i say their intro with them. So i wanted to say "what up its your gurl superwoman!!" But while i was  saying that i heard in the background: "what up its your gurl lilly"

That ruined my day, thanks.😧😦😱😱😩😰😔😞😑😣
Pls do make videos with your parents Manjeet and Paramjeet.
Everyone saying she faking her positivity... uh don’t tell me ya”ll are more perfect then her ? 😱🤦🏻‍♀️ honestly maybe she is actually a positive person. maybe she not 🤷🏻‍♀️ but there’s nothing bad about it , cuz perhaps she wants to force herself on being positive bcuz she wants to get comfortable w herself, & help herself gain that “positivity she don’t have”
Take care of yourself! Enjoy the journey!
Im watching this on mute because im in class yet i can feel how forced it is
Congrats on 14 million subs Lilly I'm so proud keep doing you. Thanks for the video.
WHAT UP EARLY SQUAD
🤦‍♀️
wAit-
Woah. Just caught up on your last couple dozen vids. You are everything they say you are. I wish I could block a channel permanently.
wow None positive comments at all!!!!
yay!!!!!!!!
There have been a lot of videos criticizing her for comments made about the Forbes list (and are still being made). Has there been a video Lilly for her fans address this issue? I would really like to see it and see what she has to say about it. 

It seems like she's been ignoring the issue (could be wrong), which has been bothering me. So, I would really like to see Lilly get outside her "persona" and talk about it honestly. I understand that maybe she feels that people are making too much of this and wants to get past it, but that's not going to happen if she just ignores it like it's not happening.
are you going to wrestlemania????
507 people didn’t like the video because they don’t have ears and they are sad that they can’t here Lilly’s great video about inspiration!
Hey, any of the rest of you put yourself out there like this chic has????  Uh, I'm gonna say no.  So, maybe lay off a bit, eh?  We all gotta come down some time or we crash.  I appreciate her honesty!  And, how often do you "fake enthusiasm" ??  I bet I do at least a dozen times a day, and I work for an accounting firm. You go Lilly, the rest of them can shudafugup :) !!
Lilly at 0:41 looks like she is gonna fight someone
How is this on trending
We support u till the end
😄💖I'm an aspiring YouTuber and everything u do is so funny and entertaining....I just love how you addressed this I mean commercials should be more realistic😂
A ton of luck
🙌🙌❤
Are you coming to trinidad for carnival
And to all those here to dissect and find faults and then make videos on that, this video was not made for you, this was for us, her online family, who genuinely cares about her and want her to keep us posted.
It's going to be good?
MMhmmmmmmm so there will be changes as I continue to rewatch the types of sneezes, laughs, parents, and students videos. SOO funnyyyyy
So you guys disliked the video because you thought she was faking the happiness?
Hey, I know, lilly has been stressed lately but that doesn’t mean we can stop her from keep moving forward in her life. Stop saying she’s faking it even if it seems like it. The only thing that matters is that she’s happy. So let her be happy. Doesn’t matter if she’s faking it or not. This is her choice to be happy, SO LET HER be HAPPY. 🙃
People are finally waking up to how creatively bankrupt you are.
I really cant relate anymore... Maybe you just so cheesy
What a funny way to start your video
Aaaaand advertising for whatever product. Cool idea lol
lilly  I am so glad to see that you have changed I don't think it's forced and I think everyone is saying that because they want that happiness Themselves I don't think you're fake  I don't think you're unhappy I think people think that because you are really happy and honestly I don't think they want you to be happy if They have commented things like that  so stop  calling yourself Lilly   And start calling yourself superwoman because you really are one to me
Something is so off about her. When she normally speaks, she smiles. She is exaggerating her happiness. I can tell she's not. Lilly I hope ur ok
I miss the old types of video....one love superwoman zoop dialogue.... WUDDUP TSHIRT REFERENCE... Shemrrrrr.... Everything.... Even I miss the wall she had in her house at Toronto....lilly please... We want old superwoman 😭
Honestly Lilly your the most funniest and entertaining you tuber I’ve ever met all the changes you made are fantastic and it’s fine if you take your time to make your videos I hope your channel grows even and even more  and remember that team super is always gonna stay with you no matter what changes you make! :DDD have a good day!
WATCHES VIDEO: gets cancer
CLICKS OFF: slowly dies
If she was struggling with mental health then her enthusiasm is probably a little exaggerated because that's helpful when you're coming out of depression. Personally if I tell myself that I'm going to be happy and I do things along with that mindset whenever depression hits it helps me work out of the spiral. That might be what she's doing here, I don't know.  I'm assuming this is kind of an anxiety-inducing video, considering it's about new changes to her style, so maybe she's going into it with a super cheerful attitude because she's doubting herself a bit. Just my thoughts from someone with similar mental health issues.
Lily, Stop being so cringy I used to enjoy watching you...idk man do whatever but you still have my sub
Race baitting for clicks.
why did u film dis with ur phone???
much love
Idk but she just kinda seems off and like she's forcing the happiness
your on inside edition
She reminds me of Kasey from BB
Hello there
It sure is! Less views more clout chasing.  Soon you will be that cool old mom character
for real you never change
Lily video seems boring now idk just being honest...
I’m finally early for once 🤩🤣
I feel like her channel changed when she became "bawse" it felt like she was the pretty face of a company, not a person. This forced positivity and the lying for views was happening a while ago. I feel like she's not lilly anymore, but an empty shell of what lilly used to be being run by a corporation
I hope she goes back to the good old lilly I was watching a few years ago... her vids are so forced now and scripted :/ it feels not authentic
We stand by you, Lilly! Happy you're happy! Keep up the awesome videos!
Is this scripted? She keeps looking down
LOVE YOU
gorgeous
You won't read this but here we go; Damn, Lily Singh, I followed you when you were in Canada still. You made hilarious videos, I felt you really represented Indian comedians well and I loved the incorporation of india that you used to do. I can't say for sure where you are headed, but please know that the people who give hate to you are the ones that only see who you are as a person at this time and moment, they weren't there for those past videos where you were more personal. They took a comment of yours way out of proportion and it seems like you've become the biggest thing to hate. Which means you should take those comments and you can reflect on yourself more. You can stop forcing yourself, which you have begun to do, you can change the direction of your channel. Point is, this hate towards you isn't coming out of no where. But that doesn't mean that it should be this intense. I love that you are changing, it's what needs to be done. Please be in a better state of mind and I wish you the best of luck. I'll lurk here and there, your new content didn't really suit me when you moved to LA but that's okay. Because I will still remember the videos you posted in Toronto and how they made me laugh and reminisce about our culture. Make jokes, have fun. Love that you're in a better state of mind, but show us that you are.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This video is very.. forced. I can tell by the comments many feel the same about how Lilly isn't herself anymore. She isn't the same Lilly I subscribed to two years ago. I feel like I started to feel this way ever since that music video with all the personas in it. She has changed so much and it feels like she is now forcing herself to be out there and with this she feels.. fake. Forced. Over exaggerated and not the one many came for.

I don't even watch the videos anymore since honestly it has all lost my interest after all this change. I stay subscribed to support, but I don't watch.
I am so happy that you're back with those positive vibes! You're literally the only source of inspiration in my life! I'll never stop watching your channel no matter what. You're an amazing person! Lots of love 💕💕 #teamsuper
This channel is dead!
I can see through the fake enthusiasm and fake excitement for more of this YouTube drama.. which makes me believe that this "break for creativity" is nothing more than a long term break from all the social hate she is getting.. Guys please try to spread some love because she's going through a lot rn
Do u booboo
I get that you want the best for us and you want us to focus on ourselves but not all of us can afford to take time off of work and school
It's still the same only the names have changed
So glad to see you back.  You look great, rested, and glad you found the clarity you needed.  I have following you for at least 5 years and watching you grow personally and as an artist.  I am glad you are taking the pressure off yourself by not sticking to a regular upload schedule.  Do it as you have things ready and when you want to.  Your true fans will watch no matter what day it is.  I am a little sad you are retiring the “Superwoman” title.  I know you have your reasons, and I respect that.  I think you are a Superwoman with the messages you send out  and how you are a role model for young girls.  Be well, be true to yourself, and the universe will be good to you.
Hi
Lilly 2.0 is here! ❤️
I love you Superw- I mean Lily...I said Lily. 



WAIT!!! New name instead of Superwoman.......SuperLily!🌸🌸



Also 5 views 3.5k likes 55 dislikes...umm... I think YouTube had a bit to much to drink this New Year and is still recovering from their hangover... oh well. Love you SuperLilly!❤💛💚💙💜
1 view, 72 likes?? YouTube is drunk again lol. Love you superwoman!! ❤️
I don’t care if your content changes and I won’t hate you for it. You’re awesome Lilly! ❤️❤️
She doesn't say "superwomen" and that's been there from the beginning, things can change but not everything especially the OG things!
Yasss Lilly!🙏🏼🔥 Whats everyone aiming for this year?
this women is literally the worst
Delete your channel lol
#teamsuper will love you beside all of the new changes cause your still here!!!! 😘😘😘👍😂
I am sorry I unsubscribed  I liked the other way you did it
Wait no more superwoman!? You are superwoman!! Why are you not calling your self superwoman 😞.."what up its your girl.. Lily" like what?! And the end "one love .. Lily."? If it's for the better I get it.. and being recognized as you yourself then I understand. I'm just sad about you not actually saying superwoman because thats who you are to us.
I started watching you three years ago and I just wanna say you’re inspiring. Whatever happens I know I’m still gonna be a committed fan
Was I the only one thinking she was gonna change the channels name to Lilly Singh ?
Yess! We stan a queen. You already look so happy! We will always support you Lilly :)
I used to be as @EmpLemon would say an empty subscriber. After this I can say, you're not relevant anymore, too corporate, way too fake and disconnected. I used to like your videos, now Imma unsubscribe to make your sub count reflect your standing. 
Ciao
Why are y'all over here complaining about her "persona"? She has a separate vlog channel for Lily and this channel for skits and stuff.
not to be rude or anything  but i feel you were traying to hard in this vid and talking too fast. try to slow down and be a bit more real. im saying this becuse i care   i really hope 2019 is a good year for ya
What’s with the blonde chick in he background?
could've atleast given us the last collab of Christmas😭😭 don't get me wrong, i'm happy if you're happy but i was reaallllyy waiting for the last collab :( ! still, love ya!
Lolly songh????
Good luck
I am so happy for you don't let anyone one tell you no don't listen to all the hate I wish you the best. I am 11 and you help me to be more stronger I start to stand up to my all the hate had I had at school
go play in traffic that would be inspiring.
Do you have any sisters if you do what are their names
Sellout.
b  e  g  o  n  e   f  r  o  m   y  o  u  t  u  b
Why did you say “what’s up everyone it’s your girl Lilly” and not superwoman?
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Lily if you love me send me the money
🤢🤮
GREAT VID
I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU SAY THIS GIRL IS THE BEST PERSON ON PLANET EARTH
I used to love Lilly but now she’s just trying too hard to please other people. Her old videos were what makes her happy but now it’s just what she thinks is going to do well but it’s just so forces now 😞 I hope she gets some of her old, real enthusiasm back
Good decisions.
Hun, u already know this but just incase you need to hear it again do what makes you happy! That's all that matters! Its your life! Don't live for others! We love you and want you to be happy even if that means seeing u less! Just be yourself to the max with all happiness!
Why is there so much negative comments. She is going through tough times.
SUPERWOMAN WHERE ARE U
Talk to people like human beings, you’re doing the most
I don’t know what made you stop saying ‘SUPERWOMAN’, but all I want to say is that you are a ‘SUPERWOMAN’ ! You must ignore all the negative stuff on YouTube about you and stay a ‘SUPERWOMAN’ no matter what ! I love you ❤️
She looks like Mia Khalfia...
I'm in a really bad state but I'm only like 12 so what break can I take
So isn't there gonna be anymore superwoman?
You’re forcing this positive attitude to the point where it’s hard to watch
Everyone commenting on forced positiveness.. but I'm still wondering where's the 12th collab of christmas.. whether the previous videos reached the 1M views or not.. i was really very eagerly waiting for the 12th one
No need to change your account...but put some more interesting videos if you're really alright!😇
Y r u weird
TEAM SUPER ROCKS!!!!
When you’ve lost relevance
Can someone make the dishwasher shut up
Content died 2 years ago.
BYE.
She is just trying to make a soft transition to a more personal / vulnerable life. And it starts with the name. Lilly. Once we as viewers get used to her real name and kinda forget the SUPER, she can start to be more real. And maybe this is the strategy. it's well thought. Obviously, most of youtubers, after gaining an audiance thanks to regular uploads and a niche market start opening up. it's the normal evolution of any youtuber. You don't have to force yourself to impress people after 14M. Don't judge her. she's transitioning slowly and diversifying .
Been Busy. Im a little late...(turns a whole 380.) Ok I'm late to the channel. I swore I would have time for the new year crumbs. But hey. I'm here to stay and support you this year. You 're a Canadian. You are smart. You make others happy and you are killin the game doing it. So lets get to it. Oh do you have any snacks?...I'm starved.
This video feels off and forced.
This channel changed a while ago, right when she started making unfunny content, started lying to her fanbase, and mainly started caring about her "trending" status more than anything. LUL
Girl...just be yourself! You're not doing a favor to anyone!! You have your channel firstly for yourself!! If you want to change it, it's nice! That means that you've grown as a person! I'm here watching you all these years because I loved your energy and positivity, your thoughts and your humor! I don't know your bad side because it's not what you want to share! AND THAT'S OK!!! We are your audience because we like you! But you need to like yourself first before anyone else does it.!  So I will wait for something new from you because I believe you're interesting as a person.
She’s trying to be happy but u can see the pain inside
This is the female fouseytube.. remember i called it
I really thought I was first but then I clicked and saw over 600likes,  lol 😂.
To all y'all haters. Back off. You should know all youtubers try hard. If they were basic and monotonous, like your comment, no one would watch their videos. Also, you have a choice of channels to choose from and if you don't like this one, you can just not watch it. You don't have to voice an opinion just because you can. xo
This came out on my b day
welp guys my act isn't working and people don't care anymore, gotta change it up asap
💜
I honestly hoped she was gonna say that she was no longer an sjw but you can only hope ig
U r my inspiration!




Thank u💗
Hey
🎵Secure the bag, secure the bag...🎵 😂😂
Wow 14 Million Subscribes , i am speechless , just happen to come across your channel , pretty good video .
Even thought this is drinking up my data , is still clicked straight away
Does not matter what is happening. 

WE STILL LOVE YOU😘😘
So many people here are just looking for drama and typing out stuff they have heard from other youtubers while not understanding her content. Some critisisms have truth to them but most are just dramatic. People are mad when she is going through stuff, people are mad when shes happy, even if she isn’t the happiest shes ever been people can still try to be happy for themselves. I’ve watched her for a long time and I think she’s a little confused right now and there is alot riding on her as a ceo, but hopefully these changes will help her in general
Lily your awsome especialy when u act as your parents i looove that lots of  love ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
What you mean
😂😂
Lol the fake enthusiasm and clichés in this video are unbearable
At this point these serious videos are kinda click baity
Here for the comments, not the content. K bye 👋
Is she Hindi bindi Indian
if she rebrands herself as lilly singh i will be as shook as i was when dan rebranded himself as daniel howell
No changes. No changes. No changes.
Listen I love her and all but like is she good? Can someone check on her? Ik she said she took a break but tbh she still seems like she’s trying too hard to make us believe she’s okay. If you’re not chilling that’s cool no need to scream positivity down my throat to make me feel otherwise. Still sending love ❤️❤️
Are you going to be saying "what up every body it's your girl lilly" instead of "what up every body it's your girl superwoman"now
Lilly, your channel is dying. I feel like this was all forced happiness and excitement. Trust me, I know what that looks like from personal experience. If you need to continue your break from your channel, none of us would be mad or upset in the slightest. We all know that when someone needs a break, they truly need the break to stay mentally stable. Take more time for yourself, be safe, and always know that we as your team will respect your decisions no matter what they are.
Wait did she cut her hair
i have loved every single video you have ever put out, now i'm even more excited to see all the amazing content 2019 lilly will bring to us!!!
Psychosoprano - Coleen Ballinger
IISuperwomanII - Lilly Singh
Everything is changing and I’m not really enjoying 2019. It’s kinda sad to see Lilly’s fake positivity and enthusiasm. You can clearly see that she’s going through some stuff. I really hope she gets through it well. This is just my opinion. Please don’t start shooting me for this💔
👍🏻👏🏻
the hate in this comment section is higher than my grades
Keep evolving girl and it's always great when you can regroup your thoughts  and do things  differently ..it's important that we stretch as individuals and reach the highest expectation of ourselves. Please ignore those unhappy souls with this negative comments because this can only make you stronger . Those losers are not risk takers and all there gifts and talents will be taken to the grave side unlike you Lilly who step out in the world and make a positive impact for millions to see ...one love from Jamaica and those losers need to start living while being alive..one love girl
Good bye.
Oh. 
Was hoping she was leaving..
Rip in the chat kids
Preach girl! I love your videos and they really inspire me to just be myself, so I’m so glad that you are being more yourself now! I love your content, and watching your videos just makes me so happy, even when I have had a bad day. Sometimes YouTubers seem really distant from their fans, but you make me feel like I know and can relate to you. You’re such an inspiration, and a great person role model. I’m so glad you feel better and all my love from London! ❤️❤️❤️
Tell me why this is the girl version of fousytube
Are these hate comments really necessary
wamen arent video games nor humor
Is it only to me  that she talks like the rock?
Omg can u just stop talking
Who is this Lilly and what have you done to Superwoman?
That’s our girl lilly😁😁SOO PROUD OF YOU GIRL❤️❤️YAAAS!!
I love that you are making these changes for you. No one should have to do certain things because it’s expected. If taking a little more time in between videos is what YOU want and what YOU think is best I will support you. Can’t wait for what this new year will bring!
I don't understand all the comments regarding, tea?
Whaadup everyone it’s your girl LilLy 
Me : who are you and what did you do to superwoman? 😧
I really don't want anything to change but its what u want but no lies I have been watching your videos for a long time and im used to everything so I will watch all your new videos ONLY twice a week because im used to it but again its what u want but I will still always watch your videos cause your my hero.   (that sounded so weird and cheesy but I typed what first came to mind
So pretty much she’s lazy and has a lot of money
Why did she stop saying one love superwoman I mean I'm not judging I just am so you to all the superwoman frazes this is kind of new
Superwoman content is about as entertaining as any Bollywood movie with double roles.
Does she?
She seems like a person that has been figuring her self out and sort of came out of her shell. She is very confident and appears very happy so can't wait to see her content from here on.... Can not Wait !!
Why is she not saying super women
🔇🎵
Please make a video on Indian parents in amusement parks!
Thanks for the heads-up even though you really didn't have to. What's most important is that you're happy with your content and as always you have my support 💜💙💜💙
Cause you have really a huge fan base including me...... Hoping to get a societal videos like helping out homeless ones which would encourage people to help....... By the way Punjabi fan from India
Richest Punjabi kudi in the world
U r indian
#NOTIFICATION_SQUAD
Yikes
Nice WHITE teeth
She looked like a chef🤣🤣
Hey Lilly, You are my #1 Role model and my favourite YouTube! Not sure if you will see this but I honestly love you and your videos! I have a suggestion for you: Could you maybe make more Manjeet and paramjeet (I may or may not have spelled that wrong) Hope you reply or even just reading this comment is a lot! -Random Canadian who loves you!
No matter what “changes” you make. You’ll still be unfunny.
Whatever you do, you go girl.💋👊
I can’t wait either!!!!
dont come back
Glad you’re taking care of yourself!! Loved you since 2011 💕
We support our queennn, love u Lillyy
Go back to India
I can’t wait for it all!
Sad she is turning the same as tana and fousey......
I think we have to see a failed up lily con this year........ I used to love her videos when she did I it for fun..... But right now what she is doing is clearly for keeping her channel alive and for views
I wish that we could all take a breather in other jobs that aren’t being a YouTuber.
New Year, New Lily, New Content and New Smile on our faces.....
1 view and 964 comments. nice job google
Different? I.e. less Buzzfeedesque? Less Voxish?
I’ve been watching superwoman since her first first videos not gonna cap, SHE CHANGEDDDDD ALOTTT.. and it’s like if you watch her from them and then watch it now you lowkey get disappointed because I still love her and everything but.. her videos were way more funnier and had more character. Now it’s just like.. youtube is more of a serious job to her than it is something to be way funny
Also I LOVE your new intro first thing you say thing so ya 👍
Copying shane dawson much
shoock
Can. We. See. Your. Parents. One. Day?!?!?!?
lilly,,, i have been a subscriber since 2015 ,,,,its way too clear u are faking the happiness,,, pleasestop doing this if u dont want to ,,evryone would understand
Lily drink water right now if you read my comment...
Omg why is there so much hate?! Give her a break, guys. Grow up
for some reason, when i first looked at this, i thought the title said "This Channel is Dying"
Just no!
I’m taking another breaks guys.
no hate🙂i absolutely LOVE Lilly(we have the same bday) but i feel like her old videos were WAY more relatable and funnier NOW I feel she is only doing stuff to get views. I held off on watching this video for a while because we all know how Lilly gets when she pretends not to be a funny, crazy, hot mess (like the rest of us) I feel she is more relatable when she acts like how she always did back in the middle of her career . 😃
If superwoman say some thing about Britain I will look for her I will find I will kill her
Kushti lad k dekha
I am REALLY happy for Lilly, but is she not gonna call herself Superwoman anymore? I don't wanna sound selfish but hearing that kinda hurt =(
She was more relevant when she was on a "break"
Guys, don't worry she'll be okay please stop complaining she's is just trying to tell you to speard positivity nothing bad is going on 😔
I want to feel excited for "the change" but I feel like it's going to turn into a disappointment just like everything else she's done in the last couple of years. not to mention that half the changes are copied from Shane Dawson's journey!
I’m just one person in this sea of comments but it saddens me that people are throwing accusations left and right. Being a creator is hard and I respect Lilly for being able to put out so much content for so long. She deserves a break and she deserves to do what she loves and she deserves to embrace change if that is what she wants. I don’t care about how many people think it’s forced or fake, I believe that Lilly will find her direction and that people should support her.
Wow! What’s happening to ppl writing all the negative stuff...BREATH! Its not that deep guys! Y’all analysing this like its some movie...its like a 3min video....calm down....IT’S NOT THAT DEEP
3 views and 1.3K comments?! Come on YouTube!!
this is the first time I watched a video from this channel because it was trending and umm I think this is the last time also because she is too noisy
So much struggle
This title gives off the vibe like this channel has not been doing  well and not they need to make a drastic change to gain or even stop losing subscribers.This is what happens when a channel has plateau.Hopefully that not the case for this channel.Whoever wants to find out check her social blade and compare the traffic and number from now to the last couple of years around this same time.
The moment you reveal a weakness, you will receive hate, just like we are now seeing in the comments. It's so sad how people have to do this. Lilly hasn't taken the length of break she needs to, she needs more space, but I respect her for making these changes that will help. You all need to back the eff off and leave her be. Sort your own miserable lives out before you bring your drama here.
She's becoming a female version of FouseyTube.
I know change is inevitable but I still miss the old Superwoman set up with the awesome background that had posters and stuff on it. 

Honestly haven’t watched a video since then. She should’ve taken that whole wall with her.
I was watching this reaction/commentary channel a few weeks ago and the guy described what's wrong with Lilly (or her channel) very accurately : "she's making 2014 content in a 2018 world." Her comedy was relatable to like teenagers from 2010 till 2015 I would say, but don't forget that your audience grows up, and you should evolve with them. I was actually 18 when I started watching Lilly, I'm almost 22 now, and I just don't find her as funny anymore. I want to though. Still support her in everything she does, i hope great things happen to her from now on, i hope Unicorn Island productions really works out for her, but the whole Youtube thing is kinda going down hill.
Fun Fact: You can’t breath while you smile






Ha, I just made you smile
She did so much in 2018 while I just slept and slept then I slept and then in the last few months slept again.
This year must be hard for her. She got a lot of bashing and criticism from toxic YouTubers. Even some of her own fans turned on her by saying they do not find her funny any more. 
To me, she genuinely looks like a nice human being who sometimes make mistakes. 
I really wish she gets a lot of success and happiness in this year as well.
Is it just me or does she seem much happier than before she took that break. She looking happy just makes me smile. uwu
Hello Person scrolling through the comments!

Yes, I'm talking to you!

I hope you are having an  day!

Your  !
Who else clicked sooo fast BEFORE NOTIS?!😂 BUT IM ACTUALLY Šüblłïng to anyone who łïkeš this čommeñt and šübś to me Rëpłÿ when û doñe🥺
Why are y'all obsessed with the views amount?  She's livin her best life. 😂😂😂 literally she toured, she's a millionaire, she doesn't really need YT anymore but still does it because she loves team super. Those who haven't been here before she was HUUUUUUGE don't understand her humor. I think a lot of people are jealous especially other Youtubers.. She has 14 M followers has been on TV, been in music videos and more.
I ain't gonna be turning u back. Those down days u always made me lmao. I luv u. It's okay to be mistaken. At the end noone is perfect!! Lilly hope 2019 be a blessed year for u. Where in the world is superwoman today eh!!💞💖
Dear Lilly,
Discovering your channel and your vlogs truly cured my depression. I don’t know where I would be now if you hadn’t been here. Tysm for existing
THE BEST PERSON ON THIS PLANET. Lilly you have inspired me so much I cannot put it in words. You inspire me to work hard for what I love, to be honest with myself, to love myself, to be kind, to do everything I can to make THIS life, MY life THE best I can. You're advises really help me when I am going down, your light enlightens all of us. Thank you for being you Lilly and the whole TEAM SUPER wants nothing but for you to be happy, so do whatever makes you so. BTW happiie birthday scarbro! I love you both.
Did you know you can't breathe while smiling?

Thank you for putting that feeling into words. Keep going Lilly. You are going after what you want and you are amazing and brave to be who you were made to be in this world. It's hard work but it's so good and I'm so proud of you.

Lilly you saying that our comments are crucial to you warms my heart because you're the reason we keep coming back.  There are times when I'm in a really dark place and all of a sudden I see your video and all that unhappiness and stress fades away. You have a very special gift/talent. You make people smile and you deserve all the rewards and praise that you're getting because you inspire others to do the impossible. We love you Lilly. We always have 💪😍🦄
Pls do a video about "My parents reacting to cardi b's money"
I love you..ur my motivation 😗❤
I have to agree, Lilly is the biggest inspiration.
Amaaaazing year! I'm also glad you seem in a better place considering you mentioned you had some tough times in 2018. I look forward to seeing you kill it again this year!

You have to pay DC to use “superwoman”?!?!😱
I got Google ads by liliy singh #pantene that too for her video itself 🤣🤣
2018 was phenomenal 💙💙💙
Anyone else feel like Lilly is going to let go of the ‘iisuperwomanii’ name as one of her announcements? 😭🤔
This really inspires me to do all the same things 😁😍
Change is good! Looking forward to hear all these new changes. Hope to see you on tour again :D
4:49
YAA YOUR SO LUCKYYY LILLYY
Thank u Lily ,2018 was tough but ur videos rlly helped me trough it.. U are the besttttt
All I heard when you were speaking French was “les poisson” which means “the fish” 😂😂😂
Is any one else going to miss "One Love Superwoman" if she stops doing that. I am not saying that she has to keep it though, it is her channel and she is allowed to make any changes that she wants. As long as it makes her happy, then I'm happy. I am also soooo excited for 2019 Lilly!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SCARBRO!!! :)
You are so beautiful and strong, on the inside and on the outside <3
the best version of myself would stop watching this video and start her 2 major projects 😂😂😂








Best Version Me can wait 😐

You have helped me learn to love myself, you have helped me learn to find positivity in everything, you have helped me learn how to be happy & content with myself. It's because of what you taught me, l've become a more confident & better version of myself. Thank you Lilly for being you & doing what you do. You'll always have a special place in my heart that will forever be yours. I love you❤️
Always love you ♥️

There’s one thing this video needs... K-pop! (NK-pop that is)
I love you and I’m grateful for you and your positivity💙
Lilly I hope u have a good year this year and Have fun girl Yeah!!!!!
Omg was legit waiting for this viddd😂😂😂👌👌👌❤️💯
Lilly hates people of color! And LGBTQA!
on the end I felt like we sat together and she gives me pep talk and it kinda made me feel dope. thanks lili
NO JOKE, I was tearing up as the video progressed.
HEY LILLY YOU'RE THE DOPEST!! YOU ARE LIKE THE BEST BAWSE EVER!!
Make a video of you getting out of the shower please Ms Singh
Your so dope and humble
I SAW BANGLADESHI, I'M A BANGLADESHI
I can't even fathom how one can hate on this lovely lady just for doing her job!! Selling merch, collabs and everything.. that's what she loves doing and that's how she makes money! What issues do people really have? That she took only a 3 week break? Seriously?
Scarbro's birthday is one day after mine!! 😀😀😀💜💜
Don't forget the enemy of your enemy is your friend
True role model. Plz do a meet and greet when you come to Tdad for Carnival.. oxoxoxo
Happy Birthday Scarbro!

I cannot believe how much you've achieved being a Youtuber. It is just way and beyond what I thought this platform could provide. You're truly a Superwoman.
She looks so fresh. I truly feel that her break from YouTube is justified.
I love you sooo much Lily!! Hope you have the best year ever !!!
thank you for being a light in my dark days! You are so humble and I am LIVING for EVERYTHING you are doing to make a change and showing me that women can make a difference in this world I love you and will always support you! <3
lily I'm literally crying because you are such a good person you have done so much good so thank you.
Lilly you are such an inspiration! You inspired me to get into YouTube and make my own channel about my intercultural relationship with my Indian Boyfriend. Keep up the great work GURL! Wish you loads of success in 2019! Lots of love from Italy! <3

I almost didn’t record because I thought there was no way. That goes to show, it’s never wrong to take a chance.
If this is a sign of how 2019 will go, I’m up for the challenge!!! Thanks Lilly & Thanks #TeamSuper. Let’s crush this year! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I love you so much Lilly ❤️
What about meeting the rock!!! 🤩😃
A Very Happy New Year to U Lilly
Congratulations on all these awesome achievements! You're a hard-working girl. I love that. Stay awesome.
Love you Lilly!! So glad that you've gotten so far and will go over the charts in less in an hour!!!
Can you imagine doing all of this in 2018 and still crying about an inaccurate list about $....the disconnect is Real.
The stain on my shirt...aka look at the obvious!

This video is more genuine than the recent one you posted
Is it just me that feels Lilly needed a longer break? I just miss those vibes and that energy from her vlogs and the videos.. the Collab were awesome.. but everything was so quiet after that.. m I the only one? Please correct me if I'm wrong? I'm just worried..
Happy birthday scarbro!
YASSSSS LILLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
First one here!
Lily, you may have had your struggles over last year, but you are so positive and loving. You work so hard on your videos and I can tell that you love to create. I can see the excitement you feel when you are making videos in your volgs. You are such an amazing person and I hope you have a great year.
Hey just a fan who decided to take a break from the internet over a year ago because I wasn't using it well, came back recently and wanted to say I'm loving the energy of the Lilly I've found coming back (not that I haven't always). Sending heart vibes for this year and hit me up if you ever need a guide in Spain :)
Congratulations Lily, hope you'll have a great year ahead. Stay happy. :)♥
Girl you left out hanging out with Will Smith !!
“I do fashion”😂
I am 45 seconds in and I already liked it! 👍
I cant believe you did all this in one year!!! Congrats!!

Lily you are amazing
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SCARBRO!!!!!!
For the first 2 minutes of the video I was looking for the stain on her shirt
I can't say how much I LOOVVEEE when Lilly does inspirational talks. Like stare into her eyes and you can totally believe everything she is saying; also like totally get lost in those deep brown, sparkling eyes of hers. But I can feel her passion and truth and belief about what she is saying. Let have more of this in 2019 <3
Please reply!!
Happy birthday Scarborough 😉🤗😍😘❤
Thanks for this message of gratitude for the past, and evolution for the coming year!
met BTS!!!! 😍😍😍😍

Hey Lilly, you may mever see this but I hope you will.  When you say we keep you happy and help you to continue your videos really you are helping us, there is no reason for you to ever feel or be sad. You are truly Blessed, you are gorgeous, have a Blessed and Happy life, Beautiful family (including scarbro lol) and so much more. Don't let anyone or anything bring you down or make you sad you have so much to be thankful for. We love you Lilly, in 2019 I pray that anything that may make you seem sad or depressed I pray it leaves now and that you are 100% happy. We love you and God Loves you okay. :) I genuinely mean that okay. Xoxo Have a Blessed Year.
When I saw BTS I was so happy. Love you Lilly
You are the best
You go girl😘

Thank you for your Girl Love. You are an inspiration for my daughter and everyone else.
Love u
It is my brthday too😊!
This girl is my inspiration, I love her so much like she’s the kind of person you can’t even feel jealous of, you just want to hustle harder and succeed. She’s so inspirational
Needs more... K Pop! lol

My parents react to money by cardi b
glad your back from your well deserved break
0:14
Honestly same😂
Lilly, I have watched your videos for a little less then a year now, and even though im not a long time fan, I still love you and your channel. You are an inspiration and a huge idol of mine and you will always will be!!!!!!! I fully supported break and everything you said when you were announcing it and why ! I think you are one of the most happy, energetic and BAWSE person, who works to the max and when you have the amount of BAWSE that you have, you need a break once in a while, to recharge and become more awesome, like you did! Im sure 2019 is going to be an awesome, amazing year for you and your channel and I think that Superwoman is awesome, but I also think its time for Lilly to have a turn on the throne! P.S Happy Birthday Scarbro!!🎉🎁🥳!!!
Lilly, I am interested in doing a project with you. I have for a long time but don't know how to approach this with you. I hope you read this and can message me to arrange a call please?

I love you Lilly
I LOVE YOU
So proud! This is a kind of person a lot of people should look up to :)))
I want you to see in Sri Lanka
Lilly has been flipping us all of for years. Just look at the hand signal.
People call me lili 😂
“Bonjour, je suis une personne” 
Lol me speaking French 😂
YOU ROCK!!!!!!!! LILLY😍😄
Omg I love Lilly so much she is my inspiration! I’ve seriously been here since day one ! She is such a funny comedian and deserves an award! Lily literally helps people and how does she not have a boyfriend !? And can we just mention that she got the highest paid actor to be in her video?! So....Thank You Lilly ! 🙂
Your awesome lily!
You inspire me so much
out of all these gorgeous things that she has done, for others, people are really only going to focus on her "lack of humor" that i honestly don't see because she is just funny and gorgeous by being herself... <3 it's sad how people just look for their own desires and don't see the amazing things half of us aren't even doing, she has funny and  great videos but she does not always have to be a clown for the crowd she can be herself and that is more than enough, for youtube, for us and for the world! Your the best lilly, i hope you notice my comment i've been watching you for years and i love you more by every video you put up, i hope i can give you a big hug one day, you have made such a positive impact in others life and my life LOVE YOU  <3 We are ready for you Lilly <3
i love sooo much
keep up with the good work




Edit: OMG THANK YOU FOR THE 3 LIKES😊😊😊😊😊
Hope your having a great day xoxo
Yoo I’m so jealous of lily she invited a SLOTH INTO her HOUSE. I absolutely love sloths
#TheRajahFamily 💛
I want to meet you
happy New year have a great 2019
Love thisss
I stared reading your book and it's like I'm on heaven it's the best thing i've ever read I'm on ch.15
Hahahahaha 🤣

https://youtu.be/1QILSWR7oY4
Hahahahaha 🤣

https://youtu.be/1QILSWR7oY4
“What would Lilly do?” Omg literally had this thought (about myself duh 😂 ) the other day. Godspeed sista! Great minds think alike. 😉
have a good day (especially Lilly)
Wow lilly.just love you😘
Cheer up Lilly because I have some reallocate bad experiences with 2018 too but I hope that 2019 will be really good
I love lily omg
She really is an amazing human
hello hope you have been doing great these past couple of months ...and as trend goes..I've got to say our relationship subscription is over.. but I still love it when you give back to the people..so I'll stay subscribed to your blog...even though I'm not subscribed right now...but it's over because I'm subscribed to you not all those guys you have around you..but ya ...I'm ghosting you
Yo   you are dam good

Yay!!!! I wake up to another video!!!!
Happy new year

I love you as a sister
Make a video on girls showing sings of having crush on you 🤗🤗🤗 plz..
Welcome back lily
Hey I think you're doing amazing. You've achieved so much and you are my inspiration. Your content is going to make a comeback don't you worry Lily Singh. Have a great year ahead
I'm also trying to do more this year !
When she said Assalamualaikum in 5:21 ....  Lol so CUTE 😘. I'm proud to be a Muslim Alhumdulillah
hope you are coming back to Trinidad for carnival!!!
2:55 I thought that was lily?!!
I need this. It's funny cause I always think to myself "you need to step out of your comfort zone" or "you need to control your thoughts (so you can accomplish more things with a clear head)" and yet whenever I watch one of your vids & the same thoughts are expressed, it feels like a sister reminding me to act out on those things I wamt to do...so in short Thank you always Lilly and I hope 2019 is another year for change, learning more about oneself, and girl love 🙏🏾🙌🏾💜
Omggg like if u agree scarbro is the cutest!
WE LOVE YOU LILLY!!!!!!! I can't wait to see more of your AWESOME videos!!!!!!!!
2018 WAS YOUR YEAR LILLY
I love you lilly
You are hope and light to millions of people . You gave us inspiration in our darkest times we will help you in yours be happy this new year
this girl changes people's lives , lov ya

Can your parents react to Money by Cardi B
ok so lets do it all again
I feel so bad for Lilly cuz her views are dropping a lot , she deserves more😥
She has so much positive energy since her YouTube break. I love that she took this time for herself!
Wouldyou be attending trini carnival this year?
❤️❤️💞Luv your videos lily they make me laugh 😂
MASSIVE SUPPORT💕💖💙
I had a dream that I met you but I put my feet up on the table so you left!
Like this it's my bday. I'm 15 today.
Lilly never fails to make me smile ☺... & I know will continue to make us laugh more in 2019 ❤
I love you Lilly
I and Team Super did all that?    (Trembling lip, sniff, snorgle.)
2018 was just weird, not good or bad, just weird.
Scarbro has the same bday as me...
Happy birthday Scarbro!! (I'm sorry if I spelled it wrong I am very bad with names)
Lilly i got ur merch its sooo goood
The thing about 2018 which made it really really depressing was that the hate on social media in general was horrible. From Zoe Laverne to jojo siwa. Especially TikTok, I have that app, and it’s horrible😭 but it’s over now, and it’s 2019, a brand you start❤️
Superwoman is awsome .. I will always love her. Team super forever ❤❤❤❤
#TeamSuperLovesYouLil
Hey lilly 

Please visit Zimbabwe and Botswana😊😊😊
How can i be a part of the year review
I GOT UR MERCH FOR XMAS!!!!!
Been here since 2011 😘😘😘
Your awesome
Okk.. You néed to know that I've been having goosebumps all of the duration of the video... Wawoooooooo! Applause
5:40 that girl slaysss
1k subs with no vids?
Lilly Singh. I hope you have a much better 2019. You have helped me get through a lot of dark times. I see you have a lot of unnecessary hate coming in - kind of like what Anne Hathaway faced. People really don't like successful women though they will never admit it. I'm not young and I've seen this happen often. 

I really wish you the world and more. Seeing your hustle makes me believe again. Here's to staying strong and having the courage to be happy. 

Happy New Year, Superwoman. Take care.
I miss so much of youtubers accomplishments
Did anyone notice Lilly not wearing her superwoman ring?

My 2018 was the worst year i have ever had..😑
Hy Lilly. I am a seventeen year old girl from Swaziland and I wanted to say that you are a great inspiration to me especially when you opened up about your mental health and how you feel about feminism. You are awesome and keep spreading the positive vibes and being open to this generation. ♥♥♥

I was so excited to see your book in a South African bookstore I just want to say thank you for all youve done for me you've inspired me to be more creative and if it wasn't for all your videos on homosexuality I wouldn't have come out to my parents and when I have a really bad day I know I can come home a watch you and all my promblems disappear so once again THANK YOU
Ily Lilly ❤💛💚💙💜
👌👍👌👌👍👌😍
Let's hope 2019 is dope and Trump gets fired from being president
Its good that youve done all of these things but it feels like im just watching a very narcissistic youtuber
Ya know, superwoman is one of the most hardworking youtubers in this industry. I feel that maybe she needs to take more of a break because dis girl uploading vids like a fanatic.

The best think about you that you are indian

You are just amazing !
Luv u lily
I just wanna say this:


When I first knew about u was when I was having a bad day and crying so hard, then suddenly I found you on my recommendation and I clicked on ur video and let me just tell u how happy u made me.

I went to bed smiling that night and since then you never failed to make me smile despite how awful my day is. Thank you so much. 💙🌈
Make a video on your personal life please.
Lilly can you give me an internet hug I need a hug
I'm so surprised and ecstatic about all the things you did in 2018. It's not being just a Youtuber. You used the platform to do amazing things and you continue to inspire people and showing them you can do a lot of things. Thanks
Great 2019 for ya Lilly :)
I want to throw up because of how cringey and fake this is
First
Idk how but my country is not in this video! Lmao
First here
Reacting to twitter about your complain on men having more youtube income does not make you seem to be relevant
what happened in 2018: channel died

that’s the tea😘
Hey Lilly! I feel like this is going to be a long shot but here we go. I've been watching your videos since I was in 8th grade and I have been graduated now for 2 years this coming May. I've been a superfan for a really effing long time. On December 11th 2017 I met this guy, his name is Brian. We hung out for a bit and I went over to his house a few times but little did I know I would fall madly in love with this guy. I moved in with him shortly after. One night we were sitting on the couch watching Bad Moms and when you came on I scred him because I screamed, "OMG ITS LILLY SINGH!" and he was like "Who?" Well, I stopped fanguying, slowly turned my head, and said "Pause the movie cause I'm about to change your life." We stayed up until 3am watching your videos. I got him hooked! Brian and I are getting married May 25th, 2019 and would love it if you could be the one to do the ceremony. If not, at least be there. I will make you an invitation and everything. Thanks!❤❤❤
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SCARBRO!!!!!!
omggg i love ur videos lilly ur the bestt😍🥰
Missed you! Can’t wait to see what you bring us in 2019 🥰🎆 You’re really the best
you're amazing love u
Thanks a lot Lilly for the encouragements and for already motivating us to be how we wanna be and so much more, so yea, we're gonna rock this year too...thanks again and hope you have a great year 😁♡
You are amazing! 🤩
We love you Lilly 
Happy Birthday Scarbro and Happy New Year Lilly and Team Super
You inspire me so much and u inspire me to hustle harder
How do we get to feature inn these videos?
2018 was "rufffff"
Love this❣️❣️💃
I love her nose ring 💛
u are an inspiration
I can't believe this flopped
Not going to lie - VERY disappointed with the content and the lack of comedic integrity that is lacking in your videos - your sarcastic early '90s type of comic interaction with the camera is horrible - I wanted to be impress or intrigued but i wasn't and I think @stevencrowder was spot on - your only "popular" because your in a niche area - being Canadian your not a good Representative of the ability's that come out of Canada.

I wish you well  but you should invest some time into production skill improvements and maybe then maybe get some acting classes into you - and loose the sarcastic down-talking to people - and the fake accents are absolutely horrid as well -

Hope 2019 brings you extreme happiness and successes.

Cheers
Your channel is on decline....Now ppl got the sense that your content is mediocre. Even after getting celebrities in your video you are not getting much views :D
im gonna be straight forward, i like you but you’re flopping and I think you need to invest more time in your production and editing, backlash from your recent actions was obviously a factor but it’s also your new way of comedy, it’s just not liked
I really hope youvdont get married so you dont reproduce
Bts😍 lillyyyyy
I just found your channel. Apparently I am newer than new to YouTube, not just a few months new here.  Happy New Year.
ok girl you got me. i’m resubscribing. you were my childhood and no matter what they say, you’ve been living your best life for years and that hasn’t changed a bit. You are a kind ray of sunshine and i think that’s been missing from my life since i unsubscribed.
Legit smiled the hugest smile seeing a new upload from Lilly!! ❤️
Scarbro’s bday is on 3rd Jan?? 
My dog’s (Leo’s) bday is today!!
Fourth Jan 

Happy birthday Scarbro!! 🎉🎉🎊🎊🎁🎁🎊🎊🎉🎉
You should be a motivational speaker! (Jk but like, seriously, you're so inspiring)
okay but like lilly you look so bloody gorgeous in this 😍😍
I’m so proud of you!!!
Happy new...Thursday!
I'm too late
I feel like you're really good in "living the life you have in the best possible way" and I love that😍

Why is Lilly Singh getting so much hate nowadays? Everyone got so mad at her for taking a break then dropping merchandise. But what about the fact that she could have taken a break because she found it stressful to make good videos and design quality merch at the same time? Also, why is everyone mad at her for not taking a "long enough" break? And if she did take a longer break, people would get mad at her for quitting youtube. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. And she said she would start making videos again when she was ready, not when people wanted her to. I know that probably no one will read this comment, but I just wanted this to be a PSA.
I thought she was being serious at the beginning 🤦‍♂️😂
Hey random person scrolling down the comments.. 

Happy New Year, and all the best in 2019  :)
I swear they look like sisters in the thumbnail
ALICIA KEYS? OMG WHO’S NEXT??? BARACK OBAMA?

“These noodles are on fire”
“These noodles are what dreams are made of”
“There’s nothing these noodles can’t do”
Damn, where can I get some of those noodles? 😂

2019 anyone?

the 12th collab somehow didn't happen, I guess
I went straight to the comments to see if it was legit😂😂
OMG Alicia Keys is my favorite singer!!!
FOR SOME REASON I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND ALICIA WAS YOUNG EEZE WITH MAKEUP? 🤯
imma take a wild guess and say that her last collab was with storybooth
on demons and kids with rad ninja fork skills
How do you get connected with all these famous people? I just need to know for....research purposes
before the vid I want Top Ramen. after the vid from exactly a week I'm over it, literally. 🤣👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Alicia:These noodles are fire
These noodles are what dreams are made of
There's nothing they can't do 

Me:Where can I get them

When you see Alicia Key's it's wassup from xCDx, tell her, really, I'm fishing for a reply. Oh and she doesn't know me yet by the way. Serious I'm trying to make it my claim to fame. Same deal if Lilly responds to me. D

Near the end of Lilly's book she talked about listening to an Alicia Keys song a long time ago, and then finally meeting, and now they're doing a video together. Homegirl giving hope to people that you can achieve beyond what you dream of with hard work
Not noodles😆😆,but because it's Alicia slurping noodles you just may have made a hit.

Omg took so long😂
Your face reminded me of my bikini line 😂😂
Lilly is like me at school when i try to hang out with my friend's friends😔😔😔😔
"She doesn't have any other friends" 
That's probably my friend when I go everywhere with her
Collab of my dreams. #Lasey
1:06 kills me 😂😂😂😂 “she doesn’t have any other friends” 😂😂😂😂
Hahahahaha I died at the bikini line comparison to his beard 😂😂😂 lmaooo and the period thing 🤣
Who else is SCROLLING down the commen't SECTION while Watching the video?♥
“Manly Activity’s and discussions” MMMM SURE SOOOOO MANLY!!!!
2:31 C'mon, who doesn't like Kirby?! >:(
i don't find this as funny as i was hoping i would have
That ending tho😂😂😂 loved the change, great job Lilly!! ❤️
HARD NIPS LMAO RIP EMBARRASSMENT, I am deAtH
“Call Of Duty right?”
“COD”
KIRBY IS MY MAIN!
They all seemed a bit off. Their energy were at different levels. Good effort though. But seems like a random idea and not well cooked.
Genuinely speaking, this year's collaborations weren't that great. Seemed like she collabed just to complete the annual ritual. I miss the old Lilly. Merry Christmas anyways
I kept on watching Casey's glasses to see like the behind the scenes😂
We all know that Lilly can totally chill with the guys just wait until they bring up WWE
OK THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH PICKING KIRBY FOR SMASH I mean theres a reason why hes the only one that survives galeem
xD "yeah I know i'm saying your face silence reminds me of my bikini line" FUNNY AF
Ya but Casey's glasses show that those guys aren't actually there... still enjoyed it though haha Casey's one of my biggest inspirations!
You should do one with James cordon and Ross butler.... Yeah...
Omg her videos are addictive I can't stop and it's 2am I keep saying "this is my last one" then on my way to the comments section I see a video and I want to see it... I have a problem
Has anyone else noticed that all these collabs have to do with couples???
“She doesn’t have any other friends”

Relatable lmao
Omg!!!!!
My 2 childhood heroes ❤
My dream came true!!!!!
I was searching about her finally I got you .🙋
You know what this video needs?
.
.
.
KPOP!!!
Lmaooo the period rant I'm finished 😂😂😂
I cringed so hard during this whole video






tbh I am lilly
I thought she wanted to focus on quality over quantity 🤷🏽‍♀️
The reflection on his glasses... I can't focus 😂😂😂 sorry

This is awkward and I love it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
2:31 #kirbyfam4life Kirby is a good character. They don’t know what they’re talking about. 🌸
How did I not know about this lmaoooo
My guy friends reaction: 🤣 
vs.
Mine: 🤣
I'm so so proud of Lilly for these collabs. Honestly can we all just appreciate the effort she puts on despite it being the time of the year we're all supposed to be chilling and being lazy. Love u Lillyyyxxx
I mean she is always cringy whether it's in guys party or anywhere else..I get the joke..
I play smash and my favorite character is actually Kirby but I spam the side special
The part about the doctor was hilarious 😂😂😂.
Lilly i am called Lily with one L ! So we have a similar name.
it took me twice as long to watch this video because of the secondhand embarrassment that I felt 😂
The way she says your face is like kinda my bikini line
My name is also kacey so it was really weird/cool to hear Lilly say my name lol❤❤❤❤
Love you Superwoman❤🔥!
4:47
Tbh I was expecting my little pony 😂
that was painful to watch
I love it!😍😍
I love you so much Lilly!
I didn't stop cringing 🤣🤣🤣
For all you ladies out there, guys night isn't like that. It's suuuuper fun. You just goof off and be yourself. Especially if they're your friends, they'll love having you to add your two cents. Like this comment if you agree!
Im literaly crying 😂😂😂😂 ily so much lilly 💕
Who else clicked so fast!?!?!? Notification squad where ya at!?!?





Btw I’m a small youtuber
My favorite smash character is Isabelle
What if the blood got on him lol
Cases is pretty intolerant, not very open minded is he, more traditional, can tell.
749K views in 2 weeks?? Thats it? Thats definitely a new low for lilly
I love you so much Lily!!!!!! This is such an amazing video idea... very relatable.... hehe
PLEASE DO RYAN HIGA!!!!!!!!!
WHEN YOU SAID NEW YORK THIS IS LITERALLY THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MY MIND!!! (the collab) GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR BRILLANT MIND
the wall approaches as lily struggles to maintain relevance
the collabs are FIRE this year
"Your face is kinda like my bikini line" omgggg 😂😂
Tbh I blended rightttt in. Am I right?! Haha! Only two collabs left aka I only have one shot and tbh it might be 11 collabs. We'll see hahaha I'm not stressed you are!!!! But real talk. Hope you're enjoying them. x
Do we need more collabs:
Collabs.
This is hilarious❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why Your Subscribers Not Grow ? It only 14M Since  4 month ?
HAHAH I'm sure everyone wants Lilly to crash your guys night, i really liked this!
omggg the collab we needed!!
Idk why but it’s like an habit like before I even watch the vid I just like it 😂😂❤️❤️
Who's next? David?

This was funnier than I expected. You got a new subscriber.

Lilly's motto for this vid 

Improvise Adapt Overcome
I cannot comprehend why this has so little views because it's one of the most relatable videos ever. I love both of them! Keep going lilly, we are so glad to have you back ♥️
Love this

EDIT:*WoW can’t believe I got only 0 likes jk I always have 0 likes*
Why are her collabs mainly with men?!? Wasn’t she the one with an issue of not many women.... Idk 🤷🏻‍♂️

Imma start a thing... I’m sorry Lilly buuuuuuuut 
I ship it! 
Teehee jk
Christmas has definitely come early! 🙌 my favourite two YouTubers in one place!

Lilly’s honestly just so hilarious 😂 she never fails to make me laugh 😆
Tea Tree Oil and Baking Soda
Leave for an hour or two
Sweep it off
Boom, clean bed
This is painful in the best way 😂
That beard dude reminded me of Zac from CollegeHumor
This is legit THE best thing everrrrr!!
i am still subscribed with the notification bell on!! ive been subscribed to you since 2016 and now it's 2018
lmao!😂😂😂 "you're face reminds me of my bikini line."
U are my life idol and inspire me to hustle😘💗🌍❤
The reactions of the guys had me laughing so hard lol one of your better videos Lilly!
"Happens to my bikini line all the time" OMG you're blending right in sweety
Its cod😂😂🤣
Been loving the collabs but this one felt... Off.
I don't think it was entirely Lilly/the writing though, I think Casey struggles with doing skits
8000th like! And I absolutely loved this collab!! 💓
Early flight in, just in time for day 10😁
You're all a bunch of hot messes at this guys night 😂
Love u lilly!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘
You should do a collab with yourself. This is a pure compliment. ❤️
I Was More Disappointed When I Found Out Casey Neistat Didn't Have Nice Tats
-Idubbbz
Lol lilly you are totally nailing this 😂
the part where lily said she mains kirby

i feel called out
OK I DID NOT EXPECT THE ENDING IM SO SHOOK
her videos are horrible... not at all funny... it ducks considering her videos from at least 5 years ago were hilarious
You’re so pretty and funny


EDIT
Thank you all for liking my comment you don’t know how much it means to me
I really enjoyed this one, she is so funny.
Can I just say that every time o watch your videos I laugh out loud 👏👏❤️💙❤️
Lilly, you got this! Merry Christmas Lilly and Team!
Cleaning the mattress is painful. It always happens to meee😭😭😭😭
At the end Casey was wondering when Lilly was gonna do the outro so he was mentally preparing himself for it and... still messed up LOL SAME CASEY SAME
You know I'm waiting for the one collab that actually does Lilly's outro correctly
MEEEE LITERALLY MEEEEEE but i actually fit in... 😁
who else loves Lilly Singh??? ✨✨✨




✨also i’m a small youtuber x✨
I’m trying to hit 2.2k by the New Year💗
What sort of guys talk like this ?

Girly guys
"she spams down b"
What about when Lilly left and they wanted to watch The Notebook? And that guy was like "I think I wanna settle down" and all that? That got me laughing so hard
There's one thing this video is missing: 


K-POP!
Hi I'm the person that NEEDS to see Harry Styles here
"Your face reminds me of my bikini line"
i just loved this one...🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂
How on earth did you manage to pin Casey down to give you time for a collab?
Great one Lilly.
"She doesn't have any friends" same 😂😂
lol tmi xD 1:32 nvm I continued watching ITS EVEN MORE TMI LOL.
Omd Casey is so chill...love it! 
I'm seeing this whole line up of people and I'm low key hoping for a Michelle Obama collab
1:48 Oh noooo honey 😯

I'm surprised he didnt take that as an insult 🤣🤣🤣
"iM TaLKInG aBAUt mY faCe"
I can actually fit into a convo like this. I can be one of the dudes. You cannot...*sighs*
Lilly, I love your content, but this is not how guys act or talk
Can you please do a vid with Ronda from wwe she’s the rocks bff
Loved this. I couldn't stop laughing.
The two cringiest people to ever exist together. This isn't gonna be fun
When she is trying to be funny but fails miserably.
I love playing as Kirby!
this was genuinely so funny, made my day!
OMG A CAVEMAN!!
Yor face reminds me of what?!!!!!   Lol! 😅😂😎😜
The next collab better be

Okay, I've been scrolling down the comments for a while and it seems like I am the only one to notice the camera/script/crew reflections in Casey's glasses throughout the video? 
Lilly, I love you and your videos, but that's kinda a mistake you shouldn't do after creating videos for so long...

My favourite character is Kirby too lol 😂
This was such a smart script! Wow!
Another great collab
Why did I start my dinner? 🤮
EARLY!!


This is literally perfect
Lilly being relatable for 5 minuets straight 😂
she became a instagram "comedian"...
this gave me anxiety
I was laughing throughout the video. Loved it. Also, I love Casey. Such a super chill dude.
Lol you can see Lilly holding the script though his glasses!😂 funny skit tho
Two of my favorite creators! Great to see you collab! Exactly as cringey as intended!

I was feelin uncomfortable throughout the convo...lol!
1:08 "she doesn't have any friends"
lol casey
Only one more. Noooooooooo.  I'm gonna miss these awesome collabs so much! 
You know if they acted like how they really wanted to act around her then it probably wouldn't have been so awkward.
The collab you never knew you need
What's wrong, Kevin? Are you dead in a ditch  somewhere?
2.8 reading the script. 👍 if u missed that
Omg I’m actually Kirby too haha 😂
I thought she will dress up as manjeet and go for the "boys night" to blend in 😂
the amount of times i screamed “noo” during this video
never do guy’s night ever again
Don't hate on kirby😂
I love Kirby and the rock move is my fave for real tho
Guys don’t actually have conversations like this ... right? 😂😂

I have one word C R I N G Y
I made it at the 59 min😌
me whenever my teacher tells my friends and I that we can work together on the group project 0:49
girl, you are too awkward for my liking
More people in the glasses...and cameras 💁
Hey can you do collab with bollywood celebs.. please we all love to watch that #lilly
Lilly your skin is looking so clear and great!
Your AWSOME I love your channel
Why did casey agree to this
2 collabs left. I am guessing Higaman is not going to be one of them. :( Damnit.
I couldn't help watching the reflection on his sunglasses all the time smh
The ending though!

why hasnt lilly been posting
2:19 HOW DOES HE DO THAT IT WAS SO COOL
AMAZING!!
This is one of my favorite !!!
Really liked the ending on this one :)
This is so beyond cringy!Honestly not one of her best works.I liked it alot when it was only lily and her dressed up as various characters.
🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ is all I can say.
Me with my guy friends
A video with BOTH Casey AND you is EPIC!!!! 🙏❤👍👍
This is lazy bad writing
I do not believe in the word manly and girly
He’s a great actor love his channel
1:36 pauses video & slams laptop shut IM DONEEEEE BRAHHHHHHH !!!!
The fact that these guys didn't get bothered with casey's eyewear reflection that shows the whole production crew  (+one more girl) with scripts during editing is troubling me
OMG this is so funny and awkward, I love Lilly!!!
loved that you could see what's happening on set in Casey's glasses
You know what this video needs?

KPOP!!
collab with Nicki Minaj!!! 🥰✨
Love you Lilly 😘😘😘😘😘

Ohhhh the secondhand embarrassment was absolutely crippling.....
She really needs to reunite with JusReign!

As soon as I saw the title for this I knew it was about to be cringey af and I was right

I don’t really like it that much
"Your face is...like...my bikini line"...))))
Love this more than anything! You’re writing is hilarious LILLY!
Lilly can you make my parents reacted to Danielle Cohn
These guys get nurtured when going to the doctor🤣
Thought for sure they were going to talk k-pop

I keep on looking at Casey's glasses to see whats really happening :VV
Why Casey WHY
Agggg
When will you do a video with Nicki Minaj?
Ayy! It's the king!! :D
This is freaking hilarious. How did they not burst into laughter
This video needs kpop
I have never had this problem... My girlfriend is actually cool
Those others guys should have been fainting, what with a hot girl like Lilly waltzing in a confidently taking over the night!💪
LMFAO 😂😅😅😅😅
1:00 = The reaction of my and my old college roommates whenever a random girl gets invited over lol
Really frustrating video
Alissa Violet next please !
Just collab with your “parents” or do like a long talking video where you explain the meaning of life to us. Literally whatever you do is gold!
You are totally nailing it!  One after the other!!  😍😘😇
Guys night is sacred why you gotta ruin it
She told us that her next collar is with jim Carrey
Omg last night I had I dream that u were a senior at my school and I woke up this morning and thought it was real. Lol😂
On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me ten lords a leaping ......
"I was more disappointed than when I found out that Casey Neistat didn't have nice tats"
NOT KIRBY
best one
RELATABLEEEE.
When she said bikini line they all said what I was so dead
Casey Should be editing or directing you Vlog . That would be cool
I wish you could collab with jake paul or logan paul
Please do a colab with ace family !!!!
Skittle Boys is in the comments!  Shave bro! "Vagisil" Great video! LOL
This is why I'm never invited to social functions...
Kirby for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
why are they disrespecting Kirby he's great!
1:59 that was the most awkward thing ever-
Kirby too
this is so awkward ouch 😂
Isnt it too obvious that lily took a break right before she posted these videos with high budget celebs....just saying .....something is fishy🤔🤔🤔
First
Neistat is arguably the biggest falloff from 2017
"Yeah, he's scared of me" - POOR CASEY, LOL
I don't think I can watch this video too much
Good job Lilly.
9 views, 624 likes, 232 comments. Good job YouTube.

I feel like you do collabs with famous people to save your downhill views..
OMG LILLY PLS CALAB WITH EMMA CHAMBERLAIN!!!
Who remembers when lilly used to say shmurr and make tshirt references. Happy days. HAPPY HOLIDAYS 🎄🎅♥️
This video is defination of akward

This video really needed some K-Pop

SMASH!
Lilly and Casey!!!!! Ahhhhhh
His face at 3:41 😂
um... I have to comment something funny!








something funny? ;-;
EqUaLiTy
totally distracted by the reflection in Casey's glasses
This was so awkward for me even though it’s fake I hate it so much
Don’t get me wrong though I still love Lily soooo much as well as Casey ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🦄
This is so cringey
Suprised nobody made a K-pop joke in the comments👍we are over it.Except the Will smith one is still floating around
You face reminds me of my bikini area....worst burn EVER xDDDDDDDDDD
KPOP!!!!!!!
This times your Collabs are bad Lilly... It is worse than the last time... I least expected this from you, dear.. I Alwayz had a thought that ur videos ll always be the best... Try to make your videos better.. Donot take this as a insult... It's a feedback from one of ur greatest admirers
Its safe to say we have all invited the WRONG person once in our life lmao. You can feel Caseys reputation melt throughout the vid xD
I’m feeling very called out by this whole Kirby down b thing
Who else concentrated on tge shades
Omg Lilly this video is so awkward
Straight face gang
99% of people won't read this, but




1% could u support my life dream to be the biggest relaxing music and sounds channel?
I WISH U A HAPPY NEW YEAR FULL OF JOY, SUCCESS AND GOOD LUCK  ❤
Okay great vid but 








Kirby is a great character
Girl power

Title should be, Pathetic btch can’t get viewers so she asks others to help.
2:21 SHE FITS RIGHT IN!!!
Awkwardness Alert..... I can't even...
What's wrong with Kirby?
When YouTuber pushes your videos in hopes of getting those India views
Omg I’m actually early for once
This is painful to watch
lmfaoooo
Superwoman+Casey Niestat=Best youtube video ever
I LOVE 12 COLLABS OF CHRISTMAS
ILYSM
Casey looks like he’s 50 ;-;
What is the point of this collab again?? Poor Casey :)
casey was a bad actor. wkwkwk
This guys face looks like a twisted squash

It’s mah bday today!
Casey should do more acting, he's surprisingly great at it!! 😄
That's a Awesome video 👋👋👋👋
❤❤
So that was cringy.... :)
Anyone else get super confused about the beginning
I wonder if Gabby’s next
She's back! My girl Superwoman!!
I don't think guys talk about things like that
“She has no other friends...”

I’m in this video and I don’t like it
Lol kirby, I literally pick him just 4 th same reason
Wage gap
who's the asian guy 😍
I feel like this would have been funny in 1994
Used to like your videos but this was soo cringey i cudnt bring myself to finish watching it
Would have been better if it were a 90’s sitcom episode. (I feel like it already was)
That was painfull
I love awkwardness. I loved loved this. I loved the script. I loved th acting!
K-POP!!!
iT's CoD!!!
when she said "New York" my first thought was Casey omg I was rightttt
BoomDia cod fans
We've all spammed the Kirby smash down thing, admit it
LOL
She fell off already
this was pretty awkward
I was today years old when I saw Casey Neistat’s eyes💀
there's one thing this video needs
Cod...the fish is okay in taste.
This was hard to watch
Ly lilly
We can see her holding a script, in Casey's glasses reflection
This is the definition of AWKWARD
https://youtu.be/UfA2A760SV4

100% true. Can't discuss the Notebook and "feelings" at guy's night with the girls around....they just won't get it :P  :p :P :P
Disappointing
Lol in Casey's glasses i can see Lilly's script and all the equipment
Casey The Best
My new fav thing is Casey Neistat saying “not nipples”!
Oh....................... MY GOD
I was dying
as much as I don't like Casey this video is really funny. Great work guys.
At 1:34 gets super cringey.

<3<3
Why is everyone male in the collabs?
Oh lily
LOVE 💕
Does anyone know who the guy with the long hair is?
Hey, EVERYONE! I wanted to share with you a platform I created on youtube called YourPOP (Your Pursuit of Purpose) which is a podcast for underprivileged individuals to speak on their excellence and overcoming adversity. I would love feedback from you all! Thanks a lot! Lilly, I would LOVE to have you both on for an episode! <3
Hiiiiiiiiii
These poor guys
I thought Casey was that boyfriend of Phoebe who taught the third grade
Omfg!!!  The awkwardness on this was so hilarious! Lilly you are killin it this year with the collabs. PLEASE take at least a mini break after the collabs before you hit 2019. You freakin deserve it. These have all be soo damn funny!!!
So many mixed feeling through this video. Confusion, anger (since they judged the one and only KIRBY), Awkwardness, And happiness. Since this was a nice video.
Oh. . Cringy!!
<3 ahahahhahahahahahahha
BORING ASF😑
K-POP
I'm here for super sixty what is this nonsense lol love ya Lilly

HAHAGGAGAGAGAG
Am I the only one that was trying to see the behind the scenes from Casey's sunglasses! 😂 😂
I thought she said she wont be making any youtube videos and was going on a break.... OH WELL !!!!!
She should’ve done a collab with Trisha paytas

I can see a Dead Channel.
TMI lol
😂😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽
😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Every time they said Casey I looked up because that’s my name except spelled Kaysie
both pople are cool on there own but that was not funny.
When you can’t relate to Superwoman anymore.
Where’s the content going? 😔
Hmmm this should be funny? At which part of the video should I start laughing?
👏😂
Lily Di when u will come to India again
Not to be rude or anything, but he kinda looks like an older version of that backpack kid
Hi

No chemistry between you two. Oof it’s so cringyy
“Your face is kinda like my bikini line” OMG LOL
K-POP
CCCCCRRRRRIIIIINNNNNGGGGGEEEEEYYYYY AAAFFF

This got me cringing so hard!!!!! LIke hunnny!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg omg I’m gonna explode from extreme laughter
🌹
There's one thing this video needs.
if you keep pressing on 2:25 it funny
Wow!!!!
I got invited to a friend's birthday party and it was all guys except for me- lol. Trashed them at go carts. I'd say I totally fit right in.
lol
Hahhahahah he holds himself back to watch notebook 😂😂😂😂 sometimes i really hate this movie 😂😂😂😂
I think I just died a little watching this
I have no friends in real life
Lily and Casey were cool, but the other guys were horrible.
😂😂
CASEYYYYY
I died when he said, “I bet she slams down B” lilly “I ove the love with the rock thing” or something like that. If you don’t play smash you wouldn’t understand, also, I’m trying out different characters, who do u think is best. Rn my favorite is palutena
What does it mean ootb
LUCINA
OOOOOOFFFFFF
This is like Shane Dawson with the whole LaurDIY thing and talking about crashing girls night 😂
0:34 you can see the camera man in his glasses
😍😍😍
NO GOSH
Why this guy is so weird looking?
😂😂
MAKE UR PARENTS REACT TO BARBIE DREAMS
This is totally not for kids😂😂😂
Woah
....
💖✨🌎
I guess I was the odd girl in my younger years because the guys would invite me to guys night. I was one of the guys most my friends were guys..
Why you did this to yourself Casey
What’s COD? I didn’t get the joke
I know Casey I watch his videos very awesome
Hey
Wow!Lilly that is weird girl
💘
*guys: ITS COD LILLY GET IT RIGHT* honestly, why do I understand guys much more than I understand girls (even though I'm a girl)
Yo am I the only who that thinks that asian looking guy is freaking hot ?
So funny Lily! Why is he wearing sunglasses tho?
Hello
How much did you pay Casey to hear all that
What is otb?
i hate to admit it, i laughed
Haha Casey's face 🤣
You can see the script in lily's hand in Casey's sunglasses
😂oml
Did anybody else notice the cameraman's reflection in Casey's sunglasses?
😂
😂
Guy looks like a off brand Shane Dawson lol
AWKWARD
What is cod?
I love you Lilly but this got me cringing.  I'm a fan but I'm not gonna lie.
its COD
CASEY♥️
cRiNgInG
You can see in Casey's glasses that Lilly has her script haha ps: Sorry if I exposed you lysm
LOLLLLL!
K-pop!
Hahahahaha
this is so bad these collabs are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad
Backwass
Omg hiiii
Why did you get awkward talking about periods? I don’t really get it? Or maybe my family has no filter when talking about all this stuff.
Why does every comment on YouTube not have any dislikes?
Kpop
Awkwaarddddd.....
Can someone please explain to me wtf is goin on with his hair? Thanks xxx
I hate this more than anything...
Lol
You can see Brogan in Casey's sunglasses :P
Corrin.
"HI" Casey.............
Are you talking your YouTube break?
Hey Lilly! How are you? #SuperSixty ?
It's funny how she was trying to be  more relatable to them when really it was the other way around
These “guys” look like a Gillette commercial.
:)
This was unfunny and kind of offensive. There were so many opportunity to make 1. a collab with Casey and 2. to make this topic more fun. The acting was bad (from all of them but the sunglasses took so much from Casey's expression abilities away like come on take the fricking thing of). Uagh, second hand embarrasment
Where did she get the bravery from
Haha yikes
Oh no
lily looks much similar to an  indian actress deepika kakkar
this one was terrible.
Casey you can do so much better than this. Yet again another unfunny stale skit Lilly. Please change your content x
I only watch him sometimes but still love Casey.
What does Casey do? He acts right?
I hate his square head
No
Ok
1:33 I RELATE TOO I say something that reminds me of some thing and they all like “uhhhh I’m talking about ‘insert whatever here’ AND IM LIKE “I SAID IT REMINDED ME”
2:42 lilly reading script in casey's sunglasses (maybe)
Uhhhhhhhh... this uh umm
Lololol
Five minutes and thirteen seconds of being super uncomfortable.😂
probably my favorite collab yet!
Here at 34k viewz💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻

You know what this video needs?
Hello


read more
If y’all haven’t watch her IG stories, she revealed that there’s going to be 11 collabs this year because she didn’t want to rush to find another person to collab with her and she wouldn’t be proud of the 12th collab, so she’s going to release 1 more collab and that’s it.
Who else thought they skipped to the end of the video skipping the add too?
Her content is cringey af.
Lmao.
this is me with my guy friends lol so relatable 😂
I'm expecting Lauren and Gabbie bcoz of James Charles collab
Omg I have been waiting for this collar FOREVER!
This video was so funny great job Lilly

hi there
Do a video of when your guy crashes your girl night
I love u lily #llSuperwomanll
Uhfdssdgb!!! YAY QUEEN
Guys..I can see them holding a script on the reflect of Casey's glasses
The last xmas colab lilly did with casey was actually pretty good and funny. I think Lilly’s break wasn’t long enough, feels like she is pumping out content again for the sake of it. Has Lilly ever done stand up? I find Lilly way more funny in real life when she’s vlogging then in her sketches. She has alot of substance just needs to find the most fitting medium.
OMG! This is all we needed! Thank you! I'm early!!!!.....ish
omgosh never been this early!! Love you lily! Merry Christmas🎄🎅
Brilliant 💯 Now I'll binge a few more 😂😂

Get it? Get it? >=)
Lilly:" Am I pulling off a dude bro or what?!" 
Me and other people: " NOOOOOOOOOOO"

hi
Casey,come on man. You're better than this.
What did I just Watch
Just your favourite brown cousins/uncles serving you with wisdom and truth! Haha! Hasan is the best! Make sure you check out his new show Patriot Act on Netflix. Thanks for watching!! Any guesses for collab 10?!
”put it on silent”
”how?”
”download the app”
HAAHAHAH
are my parents and lily's parents the only parents who says clean up before the maid comes??
“ I want those Balenciaga’s, the ones that look like socks 🧦.”
Manjeet looks like he birthed Hasan himself fr
Grand kids only when you're married or you will be disowned
Hasan it's nice to see you!
Hurry and clean up before maid gets here it doesn’t look nice I’m literally done lol 😂
"Put it on silent" "How?" "You have to download Apple" 😂😂😂😂dead
1:11 that get lost is the most accurate way an Indian parent dodges compliments.
I really thought my grandma was the only one that made me clean before the maids came!!!
I gotta stick with Lilly on this one....

I love those cookies
I love how she collaborated with a brown male and still chose to dress up as Manjeet for the majority of the video. 😂
“Clean before the maid comes!” Fking dead 😂😂😂💀💀💀
Hasan is so funny. And you both look like kind of brother and sister ))
2:54 this actually is so true I didn't not understand what the point of hiring a maid is if I'm gonna have to vacuum my room so it doesn't look bad.
I’m an immigrant parent and you nailed it with the good grades 🤣🤣🤣 BUT you forgot!! The most important thing!! 😑 A well off and educated girlfriend/boyfriend. My daughter is top of her class in Math and I’m trying to get her to join the math club at her school but she likes sports better 😒 🤣🤣🤣. On a serious note, the proud thing was deep. I have to make a conscious effort to tell that to my daughter every time. I know my mom loves me and is proud of me or is she? 🤣 but she has never said that to me and at first it was so incredibly hard to tell my daughter that. I don’t know why!!! I do it because for once it would be so good to hear that from my own mom and two I know my daughter appreciates it. I’m proud of her too 🙃. It’s a culture thing, I guess and it’s hard to say something that you have never been accustomed to yourself. 😘😘😘❤️
Why are they looking so good together?🤔🤨
This is so me but with Mexicans and chanclas who else can relate ???😂
2:44 oh my god...i've never seen someone open the box of cookies and find the actual cookies..i always opened it and found sewing supplies 😭😭
@ 0:53-1:53 wait does this mean in the lilly-paramjeet-manjeet world lilly has a brother aka hasan now?
This is hilarious!! “Don’t get them the thing, get them the coupon for the thing” - SO ACCURATE 😂😂😂
AHHHHH! I JIST REALISED HASAN IS THE GUY OF NETFLIX!!
Would this work for a long-dead, Manx relative?
Anyone got one of those?
Any tips?
Pointers?
No?
Ok, I’ll be on way out.
"don't give them the thing, give them the COUPON for the thing" HAHAHAHA I-
I see Superwoman, i click; I see Hasan and i break the keyboard
HAHAHAHAHA UR SO FUNNY LOL. ANOTHER BROWN PERSON THAT USES THEIR HANDS TO TALK. HAHA LOL ROFL.
The straight A one is so true for my Indian strict parents.. But I got a B for science :(
The only YouTuber who’s own ads play before their videos 🤪💕💕
OH MY GOD LILLY AND HASAN TOGETHER IN A VIDEO, DREAMS REALLY DO COME TRUE
I love Hasan.. and I love Lilly.. NOW THEY ARE ON THE SAME VIDEO!! Oh and I'm brown and live in the US.. So I can relate to everything :D
Love this so much helped me a ton! 😍🤣😍 
Thank you Lily for being an awesome utuber and comedian
Wow! Lily's beard looks more realistic than hasan's
I love those cookies they r so good I was legit eating sum like yesterday (the swirly ones r the best, they r the softest, but the squares have the most sugar on top)😂💀🍪
My mom: OH MY GOD ITS A COUPON
me: oh 😒 its a coupon
So the "cleanup before the maid comes" thing is not just a matter of my house. Phew! Feeling better now.
They look like twins 😂😂
Why are Arabs the only race that don't look like each other😂 Because there are 22 Arab countries.
I can really Relate
"This tin filled with buttons!"  * opens it *  "and it comes with cookies; they're awful!"  * Lilly can't even comprehend what she just heard *  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is literally the truest thing I've ever seen. 




....I can say from experience.
“Oye, hurry up and clean up before the maid come, OKAY, doesn’t look nice!!” 😂😂😂
I should teach my parents to take their phones off silent so that they don't ignore all my calls
I actually mistook Hassan Minaj for Abhishek Bachchan. They kinda look similar.
My first name is Md... legally... 😭
It stands for Mohammed 😂
Tiger bomber jacket squad 💯
Ok is anyone else bummed about the wedding ring on Hasan's finger 😥 Was all prepared to ship him and Lilly together ❤😍😘
Cardi B refrence
I loved the part at 4:00! LOL! You are my favorite!
I didn’t know they did a collab. Whoever said they look like siblings is spot on haha.
Two brown desi folks with amazing talent at educating folks while making them laugh!
who else expected there to be way more hate in the comments?
Lilly quit playing your dad. Hasan looks better at it 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Sorry Manjeet 😂❤
Also, why do you both have the same eyes? Lilly's eyes are my most favourite part of her, didn't know Hassan was her twin😂❤️
"get them the coupon for the thing"
"empty yogurt containers"
i've been doing christmas wrong all these years lol
LOL my parents would kill me if I gave them grandchildren this Christmas!
I'm not married!
Thanks for making me stop crying on Christmas ❤️
When I saw this i jumped for joy ahshahdjdjd I love you BOTHH AUHAHAH.
My favorite collab of the decade 🔥
Omg I ship them so much!!!!
0:45 reminds me of when my uncle (as a kid) told my grandparents he was the third best person in his class







There were only three people in his class
I asked my dad what he wanted for Christmas, he said he wanted a day off from my family :,)
This is basically an atomic bomb. If you unite powerful forces ( it doesn’t matter((usually)) in what genre), they will summon their most powerful weapons and practically slaughter the people who like the genres, so this is awesome.
I will add "usefull things".
Exemple : Flowers = useless- for goat 🤣
3:03 hello fellow russians.
hasan looks like manjit sector 17 chandigarian 😂
Imagine a collaboration with BTS
2:55 Omg my mom does this all the time😂

Me:Its a maid for a reason
At the end I literally just died "I like those Balenciagas the one that look like socks" llloooollll. This was awesome
“Im proud of you” 

When I saw that I immediately thought of V 😂 
he said the same thing. ARMYS ?!💜
Hey random person scrolling down the comments.. 

Happy Holidays :)
Manjeet looks more like Hasan's father than Hasan's actual father :'D
1:56 CAN RELATE SO MUCH
Lmao I'm guessing 2:46 wasn't scripted
IM SOOOOOOOPOP LATE 
IM ONE DAY LATE 
IM TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LATE
Omg i need more videos with them
"Oy, hurry up and clean before maid come ok". Haha that is so true.
The Danish cookies tin is so true 😂😂😂😂😂
I want does balenciaga the one that looks like socks XD
Its epic how paramjeet and manjeet still wear the same clothes
OMG MY TWO FAVORITE PEOPLE♥️
Why does Hassan look like Abishek??
Strange. These tips literally work for ALL types of immigrants.
OML, My neighbor just brought my family those EXACT cookies :D
"Don't get them the thing. Get them the coupon for the thing" 😂😂😂😂
Most of it is actually true. As funny as it may be.
My two favourite brown people in one video my prayers have been answered
I LOVE BOTH SO MUCHHH
Ahh, im living for this! I love the patriot act and when i saw that lily was collabing with Hasan, my life was complete 😊
only here for my boy Hasan!
Hasan shouldve flashed his 1310
I want that balenciaga too ☹️😂
Hahaha one of the best collabs so far!!!! Like if you agree :)
I'm actually going to use this😂😂😂
I don't watch Superwoman at all but it's somewhat scary how accurate this is.
Lily's mum: "OH MY GUUD, LOOKA VATA LILY GAVE ME!"

XD XD
Thank you so much Lilly for giving me this awesome lesson
Hasan is ligit the most beautiful person I’ve ever thing
I need you to collab with Demi lovato!!!
ALL MY INDIANS ARE QUAKING
All immigrant parents of colour are the same thank you.
I'm sorry Lilly and Hassan but Manjit is funnier than either of you combined. Team Manjit. 🤣
I have straight A's and I'm a pre med student  but I'm not straight 😂 😂
Brown parents are so reluctant to appreciate you
Hasan looks like the male version of Lily ❤️😂
OMG THIS IS ACTUALLY SO RELATABLE
this is my favourite collab
I LOVE HASAN!!! HE'S AMAZING!!!
Empty yogurts container just ... I RELATE. we have more of those than we have actual plates.
Oh lord this finally happened...
HASAN MINHAJ AND SUPERWOMAN

Hearing Paramjeet quote Cardi B is KILLING ME
Oooooh Hasan Bhai is doing these collabs
Lily + Hasan??? I liked before even watching
aye #24 TRENDING in US
omg the card with "I'm proud of you" is genius.
Please, Danish butter cookies are great. I used to have one of them-the tins! I meant the tins, damnit!-filled with old jewelry. Imagine if you could fill the cookies with things though. 

Relatable? I think so. :D

Also, cool guy. The look on his face during the whole "Phone on silent" bit is priceless.

Me: *has to look up Balenciagas.
fortunately we don't celebrate christmas, which has turned out to be the best thing ever
I RELATED TO THE HOTEL PART S O M U C H

I honestly thought that was superwoman’s dad in the thumbnail.
Idk why this is so relatable 😂 and why she needed the beard when she had Hasan?! Lmao

I relate since I’m a first gen immigrant lol But my parents both always have their phone on silent and then get mad at me for not calling back 🙃
the phone part is literally my mum
It would almost entirely apply to my absolutely-not-immigrant parents too.
I suppose one has to be an immigrant to be entertained by this.
Lmao xD
I've watched this video 3 times already
You guys make a dope team ... 👍👍
Utterly hilarious!

Can we take a moment to appreciate how good Brown looks on a good quality Youtube video?! #sigh
The face at 3:14 XD
Camera got weird at3:19
Hahahaha. All of these are super accurate!!
Lol when she blew on the tea
He looks like paramjeet in thumbnail
Empty yogurt containers. Arabs do the same. Lol.
Good word, Lily is lovely.
Hasan my Muslim dude
Watcha doin’ in a merry Christmas video and nodding your head along the “give your mother a mug to drink alcohol”?? 😂😂
Love these funny short collab vids. More please x
Favorite part is 3:36
I knew everyone she collabed with until now ...
"i want those balenciga's, the ones that looke like socks." love the cardi B reference.

WHY ARE THERE COOKIES IN THE SEWING BOX
the tea part was funny
Wish I could of laughed
That's scary how accurate this is
Brown people 😂
Hasan and manjeet are beard twins
The Cardi B reference at the end AYYYYEEE
I thought that was Ray William Johnson
Hasannn!!!
These are the best lol. Neither of my parents are immigrants but I totally relate to the one about the straight A's with your friend's bad grades to make you look better.
Except in this case it's my sister.
And she's the one with the A's....
Why is this so true
he looks like paramjeet
Why did he say his name like that
I like your mama's lipstick...lovely colour...the glasses too...and luv your dad's nails (?!)...good collaboration...liked Hasan...there was also a kind of a calmness(for lack of a better word) in this video, which I liked : ) ...and that you're very good looking is always a bonus...Happy Christmas to you!
The “ I failed but my friend was way worse “ really makes one happy lol
OMGGGG HAHAHAHAHA I VANT THOSE BALENCIAGAS THE ONE DAT LOOK LYK SOCKS
2:46 YALL! THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE SCRIP! LOOK AT LILY'S FACE! I'M DED
2:47 I hate them too 🙂
I see, so that’s why my parents never say they’re proud of me 😭 makes sense
😍😂😂😂 relatable
Why is the tin box of buttons so relatable?
I like those balenciagas the ones that look like socks 😂😂😂CARDI B
How to ruin your image even further
So accurate even in india
I like going to the jewelers they put rocks all in my watch
Hasan and Manjeet= Twins!

This was hilarious! Also, seeing Hasan made me geek out - I'm loving Patriot Act so far. I'm a different kind of immigrant, so I don't have the exact same experiences, but I definitely related to some of these. Especially the report card one
I love it when they both start talking fast
Merry Christmas everyone🎁🎁🎁🎄🎄🎄🎄

IM SO GODDAMN HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE I HAVE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES, (SRI LANKAN) BUT I COULDN'T RELATE TO 99% OF THIS, ONLY THE COOKIES PART (THOSE ARE THE BEST HASAN, OKAAAAY) AND HOW MY MOM PUTS HER NEEDLES ANS STITCHING ISH. ASIDE FROM THAT, MY PARENTS, DAD ESPECIALLY, WOULD BE HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IF I LOOK AT "DEALS" AND "OFFERS" WHICH I COULD CARE LESS OF, MAYBE I SHOULD'VE, PRIOR TO MY MANIA, I WOULDN'T HAVE LIKE LESS THAN $550 IN MY BANK ACCOUNT RN, BAHAHA (INTERNALLY SCREAMING WHILE ATTEMPTING DARK HUMOR). REGARDLESS, YOU TWO ARE DAMN FIONEEEEEEEEE, SEND BOTH YOUR NUMBERS, ILL WAIT, TILL MY GRAVE EVEN AND MAYBE EVEN AFTER (YES, IM THAT LIFELESS, ACTUALLY) BUT GODDAMN, HASAN, THOSE CHOCOLATE BROWN EYES ARE UTTERLY ALLURING AND LILLY, THE SAME GOES FOR YOU, YOU TWO TWINNING OR WINNING, OR SIMULTANEOUSLY TWINNING AND WINNING, LIKE HOW MATTER EXISTS AS BOTH A PARTICLE AND WAVE...CHEERS FOR QUANTUM PHYSICS????? ANYONE????? DO SUCH PEOPLE EXIST???? SCREAMS FOR RELATIVITY...I MEAN RELATE-ABILITY!!! NO ONEEEE? ITS A-OKAY, IM USED TO BEING A LONELY LOSAH. BYE NOWWWW <3 MUCH LOVE THO

On my mom's birthday, I had written "Thank you for everything and  I will make you proud one day" in a gift card, and my mom had cried 😭 like 0:59

Hassan Minhaj looks a lot like Lily's father.

You now a dude is confident in his masculinity that he doesn't feel uncomfortable in a wig
“But also give me all your money😐” 😂😂😭
TERRY CREWS IS THE SOFTEST BUFF BOY I KNOW
 :))
Ive never seen Terry dressed as a womon, especially him looking and acting so macho in most movies I've seen him in; comedy or action etc
TERRY CREWS IS THE PRIME EXAMPLE OF NONTOXIC MASCULINITY
At 3:00 I was thinking "She is giving him so much time in the  video...where is she"  😂😂😂😂😂
he needs to break out singing “MAKING MY WAY DOWN TOWN WALKING FAST FACES PASS AND I MISS YOUUUU”
When Terry Crews sings along the ringtone omg can't even 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love terry crews he is awesome I love his character in Brooklyn nine nine I love how his character’s in Brooklyn nine nine is his real name terry
I’m surprised terry Crews wasn’t singing “ a thousand miles” lol 😂
"I'M KIDDING!!



Am I?"  I DIED OKAY 😂😂
If only such emergency buttons existed in real life
Terry Crews. I love this man so much.
terry be out there kicking the toxic masculinity with grace and humor
Terry Crews just keeps getting better I'm laughing so hard I'm crying
All i could think about when i saw his face was white chicks
I thought Terry was going to sing thousand miles
Sergeant Terry be saving u from horrible dates
Idk y but terry looks hot as a female...
These collabs are on another level this year
I thought the ringtone was gonna play “A Thousand Miles” .
Imagine if Terry n Lilly's mom got together...








A YOGURT PARADISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My tampoon keeps slipping,whoop whoop 😂😂😂😂 Lillys Videos make my day.
When your so lonely and you flirt with your slef
Terry loves a good wig! 😂😂
I like the video but if you could ad some Brooklyn 99 references.... 😆😆🤔
Why does this remind me of white chicks 
I can’t handle my life 🤣🤣😂😂😂😭👌🏾
Clicked cause of Terry tbh
OMG....why wasn't this button available when I was dating. MUCH NEEDED!!!!
Quite disappointed that the ringtone wasnt "Making my way downtown" one lol GREAT VIDEO LILLY!
I watched this video long back and then long later I started watching Brooklyn nine-nine. Today I finished the series and I be like now Lilly's promoting my favourite show! Go TERRY!
CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT LATRELL!!!

His ringtone should have been “a thousand mile”
Nine nine!!!!

Hi -_- 
NYPD who watches Brooklyn nine nine will understand
You know Terry didn't actually do anything wrong, just a touch quick maybe 😂
"...axe body spray"

WAIT WHAT HAHAHAHAGAA
Terry Crews is the best male to ever exist and this video just wrapped up what we already knew
i love terry crews. have been watching him since everybody hates chris 🤪😂♥️
Terry Crews' ring tone should've been "A thousand mile" 😁
The Boyboy Westcoast Dates Sam L. Jackson not Clickbait
if she combined all the collabs in one video and added a story line, i feel like it’ll be a great movie
This video killed me 😂🤣🤣🤣
Ha Ha Ha! The fact Terry takes Lilly's place in the date makes me laugh so much my sides hurt.😂
I think Terry's ringtone should have been a million miles
This would have gone viral if Terry Crew was singing "A Thousand Miles".
SO F*CKIN ME BEFORE AND AFTER THE PSYCH WARD ADMITTANCE
Everyone in the comments is saying they love Terry only from White Chicks. Nahhhhh. Brooklyn Nine Nine squad where you at?!
But also...give me all your money. JK! or am i.     

Mood. Nothing else to say.
Terry Crews must be protected at all costs!
TERRY LOVES YoUguRt

Omg it's Joanna Ceddia!!
Cena is invisible but yall still have his audio 🥰
And his name is Jhon Cena
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH, REALLY FUNNY. This is the lilly I know and love. You are really good at dark humour, I don't know why don't you do more of it. You have proven that you still have got it. I have to say, honestly, I was a bit worried that you had lost your funny bones because to be honest again... the last 6 of the 12 collabs weren't funny, they were kinda sad. And I was not going to say anything because why spread negativity but in this video shows your skills really well, and what you can do if you stopped worrying about YouTube, and whether or not you will be relevant without it. Yes, your videos don't do as well as they used to but that does not matter. You want to create real content, quality content and unfortunately YouTube is not a place for that anymore.  I would leave YouTube if i were you because it is holding you back, we your fans will still be there, even you have out  grown your audience and clearly want to be more risque with your content. Work on your writing, acting and getting your own tv show because you deserve it. Change is scary but you will never know unless you try. Love you.
This reminds me of that one Kristen Wiig character
ITS JOHN CENA!!!!!!!!!!!
John looks like the most WHITE DUDE EVER like srsly

I love Misako’s hair in this video 😍😍😍

Were not married!!!!






Were cousins
Who is with Superwoman? She's just alone!
Okay emoji
Finger emoji😂😂😂
FIRST THE ROCK NOW JOHN CENA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????/ WHAT NOT FAIR
Why does it look like john cena was dressed by his mom
Why would you make out with your cousin??

"If you're not moving your dying"
What?
Someone explain the video?
Where’s john? I cant see him
If you not moving your dieing
John’s hair though... damn😯😯😯
ROLL TIDE
IF YOU’RE NOT MOVING, YOU’RE DYING
I watched the movie it was super good
Why is the thumbnail Superwoman with a floating suit?
And it was John Cena
Who is Donald Glover?!?! Will we ever know?!?!
lmao
who is lilly fighting with?
PRIYANKA TATTOO 😂
I love JOHN Cena
If you are not moving you’re dying 😂😂😂😂
Y is she talking to herslef its kinda wierd
Lol I got an ad for a movie for the rock
I watched bumblebee
"his boobs are bigger than mine"  haha can't relate haha ..hehe 




* cries in the corner *
it's funny because you said in your title "feat. john cena" even if he's not in the video. lol
If you are not moving you are dying
Anyone else saw that lilly wore a different hat in the video to the thumbnail
You said you collated with John Cena....but....I can't see him?
AYYYY AMRYY
I watched this girl's video once or twice or thrice but she keeps popping up in my recommendation it's so annoying ....
HHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAAH
John loohs a bit like Mark whelberg

LOL😂
when you have become irrelevant, so you need a A-list celebrity to be a bit relevant again
The twist at the end was awesome.
Jokes on her I cant even see who's sitting next to her
John and Lily could've at least tried to look like a couple.
They look sleepy
These collabs get bigger and bigger every year I’m- 




I’m a small youtuber and would love if I got ur support!!! :) ❤️
Why is lily talking to herself?
Were not married... Were cousins... I died
My name is becky also
AAAAND HIS NAME IS
It really makes you an actual "superwoman" if you have dated both Cena and The Rock
lol when I saw John Cena in the title, I was expecting Joanna Ceddia tbh
Poor John...
John Cena in WWE was better!
Is that John  cena from wwe
why would she be sexting her cousin 🤔🤔😂😂
Lol wow

Wait why Lilly was there alone...........
I'm just wondering why would someone sext their cousin..
I thought she was priyanka
MISAKO?
...and im waiting for 'the rock' to burst into the room and have an 'eye-to-eye' with john, while lily is gushing over the rock....
John cena Aka Grandpa was there but you can't see him...
That's messed up their cousins
When it’s a blackpink’s ad and u dont skip 😍😊✨
Man John Cena is huge
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow!! Omg, John Cena next to Lilly! Imagine in 20 years! Will she be in movies?
Why was Lily talking to herself?
"if you're not moving, you're dying."
j-hope has joined the chat
Yay you finally collabed with Joana Ceddia!
THE ROCK IS FURIOUS😂😂😂
I would love to see Lilly collab with ed sheeran that would be the best thing ever!!!!!!

All the comments about not seeing John Cena in the video are rather annoying....
Get Over It!!!
Somehow I’m now disappointed that Hasan didn’t do the pec thing...
Why is Lily alone in this video... I cannot see her partner...
Relationship Goals, am I right?

Lilly actually did a really good job acting in this
“How we doin’ over here?”

FINE
”WHAT IS WITH YOU AND FLOWERS?!” 🤣
Loved the “behind” cryptic message 😂
Who else thought cris was the other guy...and not the waiter,just me?...hm:p
It isn't my birthday
My eyes are not grey
I am healthy and fine;

We wish you a merry Lilly,
We wish you a merry Lilly,
We wish you a merry Lilly
And a happy Marandaaaaaaaaaaa!
I read the title as ‘can’t take a hit’ and thought damn

Lilly has really gone off the rails
my favourt sceen is:
waiter: this is heated
lily: same
waiter: your toast
lily: yes he is
waiter: that's cold
boy: you can say that again
Lol that waiter is trying to save their relationship! Talk about the food!!
Acorns we brought in from our local forest 😂😂
-You're nuts 
Waiter- oh did I hear someone has a nut allergie ?
Lilly-NO
Waiter-fantastic 
Me-lol
The boy with the glasses looks like Harry Potter if you agree like this comment
Did anyone else think the collab was with the date?
“me LILLY I AM ALSO A FLOWER!!” omG dude walked right into that one 😂😂😂


edit: i’m a small youtuber! just posted a skit too!! not close to being as funny as lilly but she inspires me ❤️
She and her production team put honestly so much effort in videos! I love you LILLY!
Haha “what is with you and flowers 🌺 🌹 🌸”
OMG 2:32 "I'm poppy" anyone remember that??
Lol at the start when they said Rose I jumped cuz that's my name! 😂
"Honesty, whatever you want!" Litterally mood though....
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Liking my own comment 
Since nobody is gonna do it,will you?
0:33 who noticed that Lilly actually said "yes" and the guy said "no" 😂😂
Working in the customer service industry some companys require you to ask all of these questions eventhough you might not want to
"I am also a flower!?"
THE VIEWS DROPPED DOWN LESSER THAN MY GRADES
James Charles can relate to the title of this video
Lilly please do a video with Bhuvan Bham BB ki vines and bring back the Bollywood reference videos , and see your channel boom to 20 M subscribers in no time. I'm your well wisher, u create this amazing content but not gaining what u deserve!!
Love the “ flower joke “
But the flower in the  beginning was a rose 🌹😂
Also he a cheaterrr 😂😂😒
The waiter mentions a Rosé and the guy takes the drinks menu 😂 the method with flowers
You could do one of these with Smosh . NOW THAT WOULD BE THE BEST COLLAB 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕
OMG that "behind" comment was the best most relatable thing ever for a server :')
Did anybody else catch the Titanic reference? 😂
I thought she took a break
ME! LILLY! I AM ALSO A FLOWER!







Yes, you are a whole garden. We love you.
“Me LILLY I AM ALSO A FLOWER” 🤣😆😂
Omg!!!

YAAASSS!!!
Jack & Rose 🌹 
Whaddup Titanic - Refrence?!?
😂😂😂

Oh boy, this waiter is very passionate about his job...
I'm sick in bed but this made my day...💖💖😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
When I heard
“I’m Poppy.”
I started screaming one of Poppy’s songs😂😂😂
I’m gonna need this waiter to go on!!  He is KILLING ME 😭🤣❤️
Waiter: "This is heated"
Lilly: "so am I "
I'm dying 😂😂

jack: "you just said you like trying new things!"
lilly: "we're talking about having a civil dinner not--"

I think the waiter is an accurate representation of how I try and break up my friends from fighting
0:24
"ME, LILLY I AM ALSO A FLOWER"
I AM DEAD
Great waiter, I would have been laughing if I had him as a waiter. And Lily, you found a boyfriend, right here in the comments. Me!

The title was called "when your waiter takes his job to serious" I think

"I am also a flower" sjsksjskajs
"This is heated" - "Yea me too" lol

Lilly I didn't get a notification for the other collabs that you have done. I am a subscriber, havent used the bell icon, but still your videos doesn't pop in my subscribed videos list..
Lily u r quite the actress. Bravo!
@||Superwoman|| Can you tell me who's the guy playing the character of the date? Can anyone tell me his name!
This guy has a flowerfetish 😂
It would have been so funny if she had the girl Poppy do that scene😂
“Can you find me a boyfriend?”
“Yes”

Umm yo Chris can you get me a boyfriend too? I keep picking guys that aren’t emotionally stable enough for a relationship.
Lil!

CLOSED CAPTIONS SAY LILY NOT LILLY IM DYING
The waiter most be trying to get promoted

This is Super weird. When I go to the inbox the Video titel says: When the waiter takes his job too  seriously. But when I clicked on the video it says: When the waiter can't catch a hint.

Reminds of “The Cellar”
I honestly thought the guy who was with her was Christopher but then I saw the outdo! 😂😂😂 I don’t watch The Bachelor!
But the way he described the honey glazed salmon..no way I'm leaving the food: I'll be moving to table 3 plz, thank you.

This is hilarious 😂
Is she not going to address her mental health? IM SO CURIOUS AREN’T YOU?
Weren’t you taking a break? It lasted like a week lol
I don't generally hate you, but today I do. Your videos are literally going down the drain. Look at this only 42 K views uou used to get like millions
“Can u find me a boyfriend” 😂😂 lol same
19th?
SO MUCH FOR TAKING A BREAK FOR MENTAL HEALTH
*likes the video*
Then actually watches 💕
My name is Rose lmao
It must been busy with your "mental health break"
I’m not gonna stop commenting until I get a Ryan Higa collab. 😤😂
This is so funny XD XD <3  <3
perhaps... the rosé?
When u want to try new things, but not try NEW things 😂😂
This waiter is like my mum😂
I would have been like JAST SHAT AP AND GAVE MAH FOOD!
Can we talk about how that title changed
Can we talk about how quick was the wait? Cuz I would fake argue with the boyfriend I don't have for that service.
Hard facts: He loves flowers 😂😂😂
i was so invested in the story lmao
Ok, this was pretty funny
More creative content
Hahah Its like talking to siri
and the honey  OoOAh the honey
What did the waitress say when lilly  was whispering?
That waiter is the most naive waiter ever
"BEHIND!"
this one was goooood
Lilly looks sooo pretty in this
" What is it with you and flowers?"
Lavender 😜
Now we want bloopers😂❤️
Well....This video was funny
I liked this one
This was good lol

#12collabsofchristmas
Comedy at its core!
Poppy Harlow has changed
Lilly who do you believe in?
“Fantastic!”
Lily looks fly in this vid😍
Hey guys won't it be awesome if Lilly became the next bachelorette
Also couples who go to restaurants to fight. Like why go to a public place? Why go disrupt someone’s job and then leave before even ordering 3 hours later
I searched for the food the entire video
is that actually poppy tho???
He looks like Harry Potter
Relatable!!!!!!
Ever heard of elf in a shelf........




Finish it...
I’m dying 😂
Loved it!!!!!
Love from HARYANA....G...
Lavender bit was funny
I wish all waiters were like this cuz most of them say “hello”  looking like dey bout to kill
I'll be your boyfriend... 😏
Omg Chris Harrison
I swear this happened to me once, I almost kicked his face
But why does the waiter seem like he would actually be a good waiter in real life? Lol. The way he describes the food is great!
Relatable afffff 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
love you lilly!!!
And she’s back
1:30, oh trust me, we're REQUIRED to say that or our job, and we don't like it any better than you.
ok is it just me but i am so done with the same ad for contact lenses every video i watch?!
Lavender, also a flower, no wonder he was interested 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No! I'm Poppy
My name is Poppy lol
He is just being a waiter
This was soooo funny! I love it! <3
How do you get all these people to collab with!??!?

    Suppose you were rich and famous enough to "date" anyone;
    like John Mayer, dating Taylor Swift. 

    Now suppose you were naive enough to have kids.
    You've got a custody battle coming, and lots of child support due.
    "Love" is a euphemism for "money".

    The wealth and wisdom of a nation is reflected in its birth rate,
    from Singapore (best) to poorest Africa.

Love your videos
who’s chris harrison?
The bts wasn't there
I can't relate...
This was the most dramatic video yet
Plot twist! What is poppy doing there??
Everybody wants to be Poppy. 😂💖
Oh my god your videos are getting more and more creative and let’s don’t forget relatable. I guess that the mental break move was successful and didn’t go in vain. Continue in the good work Lilly
For a second I thought that was kj apa In the clickbait
Good one!😂😂😂
Lol he truly got on my nerves 😂😂😂
Loved it!
I want some acorns grilled with honey
6 days till Christmas!!!! Who's excited!!!!!!!!
When you have like 12 steps of service (things you have to say or you get fired), the couple you're serving is not only rude but fighting with eachother, and you're literally just trying to pay your rent.
Hey lilly i really like this video! But just some constructive criticism cause i know you love that🙃 but yeah i was really focused more in the “relationship” then the waiter. If it wasnt for the title I wouldn’t have understood this video ☹️ but i really like the concept tho just focus a little bit more on the waiter that it ❤️ you💖💖💖
Hi Lilly
Bruh. She got Chris Harrison to be a waiter?! Lilly is the king.
Plzzzzz do a Collab with jacksepticeye!!!!😃
Why does she keep clubbing with people we don't know
The waiter seems to be helping Chris 😂
Lavender chocolate cake? Oml, Lilly you are good! Who noticed that 😁
WE'RE FINE
hey this skit was actually better than the last few videos! keep it up!
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND FLOWERS?!?!?!
Lavender ???? ..i'll take that
Lilllllyyyyyyy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
#TheMoment @2:43
I love U so much ########
Omg he has a flower fetish that is weird
Just so you know, the subtitles spelled Lilly "Lily" (eye roll)
Hey Lily, I’m loving the 12 collabs and have been watching for years. This years videos are great but I really miss seeing you collab with fellow youtubers. And it’s not just you, it’s all of YouTube it feels like y’all only collab with friends and people you know, whereas back in the day you used make friends during collabs.

Anyways its super exciting that you’re getting the opportunity to collab with these traditional media stars, you’ve personally done a lot to help that gap between traditional media and social media merging. 
But I’d still love to see you collab with other youtubers you’ve never collabed with (kian and Jc)
2:09 how come u said no but ur moth wasn’t moving?
🤣🤣🤣🤣I’m deaddd
Since they were talking about flowers who knows what their zodiac flower is mine is a water Lilly what is yours ???🤔🤔🤔
less pretty more swager   toxic nature
you are so cool i love your vieods!!!!!!!! so funny and interesting love u!!!!!!!!
CHRIS EFFING HARRISON. WOW.

Merry Christmas lilly ..🎄🎄🎄ily

You're not welcome here, Rose.
LoL! I got so excited When I Saw Chris Harrison tagged in your InstaStories! & It didn’t let me down!!! Awesome Script , Awesome Collab.  They seriously just keep getting better! killing it !!
Wait staff are just trying to do their job, there isn't a need to be rude, if you need space, just ask nicely.
She said I’m poppy and i got exited lmao

It was an ex-ident.
He looks like anthony on the thumbnail
5 hours late but no one cares LOLLL and Christmas is so close I’m so excited!!!!
Where i can find flower now
SU fans do you think it's a reference?
Anyone see the parallel? “Jack” and “Rose”
🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣
Lol I was kinda of annoyed at Chris I wanted to finish listening to the argument
Still waiting on a collab with the Dolan twins...
The most polite waiter ever
I feel like this is the year for random collaborations. Is it just me?
Love you superwoman 😀😀😀😀😀😀
Your server is trying to do their job.... no need to be rude
Wait what's poppy doing at a restaurant.
I'm poppy😂😂😂
Hilarious🤣
I am poppy
The waiter took plenty of hints he was just trying to keep the knives out of the boyfriend!
Ilysm♥
he didn't want dessert until he realised it also had a flower in it! I loved the script and acting in this video! :) thanks Lilly!
I love you
Watching the bachelor right now!
LILLY IS THE MOST ORIGINAL, CREATIVE, AND REALEST YOUTUBER OUT THEREEE
Omg, the drama that is too real. Awesome.
On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave me six geese a laying .....
It must feel really annoying when this happens.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is funny
My name is Rose too 😂
When you try too hard to get a tip.
I just realized how many flower names there are for people.
Your hair is POIIINNNTTTTTT
I loved it 😂
BUT THE FOOD
im poppy
I know Chris Harrison is the waiter...who's the other guy???
I unsubscribed then remembered how dope she was when I saw her on hot 🔥 ones and I am back!!!! 🖤 🌸 🐼
Dwl😂😂😂😂😂😂so funny
BEST COLLABORATION YET!!! Oh no I said that last time! I love themmm alll!!!!!! Love u so much this is actually hilarious and inspirational xoxoxoxoxoxoxox xoxoxoxoxoxoxox ur bae!!! Get it gurlllll #GIRLOVE!!!!!!
His name is Jack.... and his ex’s name is Rose.... titanic?
I would've FLIPPED OUT tbhhhhhhh
Jack and rose...
Amazing video ♥️♥️♥️♥️
None of this was funny...
Who else wants Tarizonrey
The guy makes me uncomfortable in a weird way. I think it's the weird glasses that make him so "bleh" to look at 🤔 or his bland vibe
I wish Rose....oh I mean Lily was my wife😍 she looks so hot
Who's that Jack guy?
I had a very weird ad that relates to this video! It's annoying texts guys send and how to deal with them 😂😂😂
iM PopPy
No poppy Harlow doesn't look like that
I lkve you your so funny
1:13 did she say BDSM? 50 Shades of Grey much?
Poppy was on Alexa and Katie she was in the second season and like  sixth episode
thats heated
Same 
your toast
Yes he is 

You can say that again 
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lily dye her hair !!!
She's literally super creative
1:12 subtle lmao
Who elso noticed at 0:25 the subtitle says 'Lily'?
Why are there two different names for the video
Chris Harrison clearly has a gift for comedy! He should do more of it!! :D
Can you find the odd one out?

💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖maybe you can't because it's the one looking at this screen!
JENNYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Poppy I do not want to hear that name agian the girl is very creepy
Who's the guy with the glasses?
that's actually really funny
Yesss
I really liked this. It was a great concept and really well done. Chris did really well in his part too. 

Only constructive criticism: watch for consistency in your shots. It appears that your hair is behind your right shoulder on full shots and in front on the tight shots. I'm sure it started in front and then you were told to tuck it cause it would block your face in the full shots. I know it may seem a bit nitpicky, but, for some reason I noticed it.
i am so angry right now
I'm Poppy.
OMG!!!!!!
'BEHIND'
😬😋😂😂😂
What is with you and flowers? 💐🌷🌹🥀🌺🌸🌼🌻
And thus the titanic sunk.....
At 0:25 in the subtitles it spells Lilly as lily. They might have meant the flower and not the name but I just saw it and got angry.
I love that she's uploading again, but I feel like she's just doing it because youtubers make more money on xmas and when it's January she won't be 'feeling well enough to upload'...
This is epic. OMG Chris Harrison is awesome!
as a waitress I laugh but yeah it is our job to take orders properly and ask about every small detail don't be angry pls
Chris Harrison!!! Bachelor
LILY Is so inspirational and I’ve taken her advice/tips. After watching her videos I have decided to start my own youtube channel with some vlogs but mostly beauty and fashion. My next video is due to drop soon, It would be amazing to get some support or feedback♡
Lol 😂 lily was angry 😠
Lilly🌼
Came to see what the fuss was about this chick and go figure, this is not funny. That's why you're not in the top 10 lol.
Lily your hair is on fleek
Amazing
That waiter guy reminded of the one from friends where Joey and Rachel is on a date
Did the title change from, " when your waiter takes its job and to seriously ",to now, "when the waiter can't take a hint "
BEHIND OMGGG
hi lilly
This is funny
And yet you’re probably the same person who gets annoyed when the server doesn’t pay enough attention to you.
That's cold 😀
😂😂🤣
🌹 IISUPERWOMANII  🌹
U look like so pretty here oh my gosh it's like when u wear ur superman shirt aahh ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡

I'm Poppy
Hello! Waiter here. Customer concern is a part of my job and even if you're yelling at each other my manager will still get pissy if I ignore you.
Im Poppy
Did anyone else get stuck on anger at the guy for trying to pressurise Lily's character into something in the bedroom (implied) that she's not comfortable with, to the point where it was hard to focus on the rest of the sketch, even though you know this is fictional!? #whatiswrongwithme #tooreal
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO FROM YOUR 12 COLLABS OF CHRISTMAS SO FAR OMG!!!!!
I hate when the waiter's just stand there and just talk for ever. But when u need a refill no where to be found
😂😂😂
That man knows what he's doing, I love it. Just like "Oooh, he's messed up and he just got here, please don't argue, please don't argue, please don't arg- ah shet. welp... Time to distract."
Her acting has gotten so much better
❤️
ayyy
Ohmygod 😍😋
Hi
Hi
I wanted to hit him from how irritating he was
Is the waiter or the bad date Chris Harrison?
2:32 "me? I'm Poppy" i was waiting for her to continue the saying with "I am poppy. Im poppy. Im poppy. I am poppy" for a few seconds but got disappointed lol.
Oml yes
Lilly looks like she stubbed her pinkie toe before a bad interview

👏😘😍😂
Ur collabs are getting more and more annoying.
I’m poppy 😂
Wow great video Rose!
My name is daisy
When a comedy video gets too real LOL. Real talk though I think we're all guilty of getting a little too offended at everything this year. Let's leave that in 2018 and move into 2019 understanding that everything ain't that serious and also that people make mistakes and rather than "cancel" them we should encourage them and help them grow. We're all trying our best. Shout outs to Jay Shetty who can't relate to anything I just said because he's legit a perfect human. PERFECT. FOLLOW HIM NOW! And thanks for watching!
Dude... you can't say woke in the title. It's offensive to people who would rather sleep...
Isn’t it ironic that this video is about not getting offended, and everyone is getting offended in the comments
but Japanese and Chinese aren’t the same thing...
Me: okay, I rewrote my essay 12 times, there can’t be anything wrong with it, I’m sure it’s perfect
My teacher: 1:59
lmao, so many offended people in the comment sea
This is so true though! You are all getting offended over everything!!! In fact some of you are probably going to get offended by this comment!😅
Lilly has been in the public eye for years. She decided to take a break from Youtube, and then still did 12 Collabs of Christmas. If you don't find this video funny, that's fine. But, don't hate on her or say she should go back to the content she was making years ago. The content then was hers then, and what she makes now is hers now. New content shows growth as a person, and personal growth is what we need in this world more than ever. So if you don't like the content, support Lilly's growth as a person. Because she's an inspiring person, a powerful female, and at the end of the day, its her channel and her content to do with as she pleases. Love you, Lilly <3
THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG WITH EVERYTHING
So...I think this video missed the mark a little, but I think that the intention was to highlight how we treat "wokeness" like a competition, and if someone slips up, we like to "cancel" them rather than educate them. Like...these are issues in real people's lives, not points we can collect to show everyone how enlightened we are.

You'll notice that the people getting offended are mostly talking about other people, not themselves. Like, the one person is telling his dad what his friends' pronouns are, as if the dad would automatically know what that meant, because apparently just explaining that his friend is trans would not be woke enough. They also sometimes use language just because it's PC even though the communities in question don't use that language (like, most disabled people find "differently abled" to be super-condescending, and also dismissive of the fact that there are abilities that we actually don't have).
THAT ENDING TURNING CRITICISM INTO COMEDY THOOO we stan.... on whatever legs limbs devices or paws we identify with. 🐾
Odd because I swear SHE is the one who gets offended over everything...






...such as YouTuber Pay :)
who would have thought Lilly would use Forbes controversy as a joke 
the ending killed me
Making a video about how people are overly sensitive , just few days after going on a Twitter rant. Hmmmmmm...
The irony is so overwhelming I think I'm gonna drown in it.
That Forbes reference at the end had me dead 😂
Imagine thinking its okay to think that all southeast asians are chinese
Hey no women on the list...

If that's what u have really said nobody would've gotten offended.
“There’s something wrong with everything!”
I m a  new subscriber and I am continuously watching Lilly 's videos today from 9:00 pm and it's 2:00 midnight now . Its just like videos after videos and wait I am watchin' same videos again . idk she got a magnetic property or something.
Thanks for ur existence in this world Lilly.
It was so awesome collaborating with you on this! Thank you for being absolutely awesome and such a joy to work with. Loved the energy! Can’t wait to do more!
I thought Lilly's fans would be more woke, or at least not treat YT comments like FB comments.
ayyy that forbes reference at the end was so cleverrrr
Yasss! That last reference was EVERYTHING! 😆🤣😂
It's so funny because people are literally getting offended over a video that's supposed to be that way,  pathetic
The shade in this video about those people that are saying that superwoman is just mad because she's not on the forbes list 😂 I really love you superwoman 💕
"wait there's no women on this list"  I SCREAMED sksksksksksk
Can Ellen Degeneres appear in one   of your collabs this year
Who's Jay Shetty? And what makes him famous?
Ok this was the best one yet. The rest pale in comparison.
WHOA THAT FORBES REFERENCE AT THE END THO
we love sister scandals
I get offended when my dad calls BTS Chinese
Guilty as charged
How offensive in the title it says get woke with a ! basically forcing me to wake up
What I don’t get is why some people get offended when you say “Merry Christmas” like are we not allowed to celebrate if some people don’t?
Make a collab with Millie Bobby Brown
2:55 Damn Lilly that forbes joke tho *sips tea*
2:55 That FORBES reference though...
Wasn't she on a break?
You can’t say “woke”. It’s offensive to people who are in comas. 




It’s also offensive to Sleeping Beauty
Lilly can u please make a 12 days of Christmas with Brendon Urie ❤️❤️ ily
It's true that everyone gets offended over everything! You all need to get over yourselves LOL!
Did anyone else notice the reference that Lilly made at the end of the video saying that 'there are no women on this list' and Jay said that 'you're just mad you're not on the list'? I think Lilly is referring to the backlash she received about being too PC when she complained that there were no women on the top 10 highest paid Youtuber list. ahaha
this is me LILLY- If you don't know him what are you doing. Me- I'M WATCHING YOU'RE VIDEO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN BYEE.  

JK I love ya Lilly.
Be woke. Stay woke.
Why I hate 2019:

This Video explains it perfectly
Lilly you do realise the Forbes thing you got offended by is coming back at you in this video
XD happy whatever doesn't offend you day to you too!
It's so important that we educate people rather than shut them down. Especially when there is a generational gap and it's just how they were raised. We really need to be more tolerant of mistakes when it wasn't meant to be offensive. It's when they refuse to listen to you and continue is when you should be annoyed. For example; this one time a teacher of mine said something really ableist but she didn't mean anything offensive by it so I informed her that her words hurt me and... she completely dismissed me and that was what actually got me upset. Meanwhile on the same day, in the class before (coincidences am I right?) some kid said the r-word, but when I asked him not to do that, he apologized and that's what matters, not the initial mistake. 

Sorry for the long comment. I tend to infodump.
That shade at the end about the list killed me
I agree that people get offended too easily, but what's wrong with telling people about pronouns? What's wrong with saying lgbtqa+? What's wrong with verbal consent? Why do you not like those?
My favorite one is with James Charles
I'm such a huge fan of Jay Shetty and to see him in this avatar was amazing...!! Honestly, I'm still not sure what was happening in many parts of the video, but overall I liked it..! ☺️
Woke..? More like being a SJW
You should react to yourself on react or FBE
I clicked just for jay❤
"Getting offended is the biggest trend of the year" the only truth you'll see online, and it probably offended someone😐😒
Me: Snoring 
Annoying sister: GET WOKE GURL 
Me: throws pillow GET OUT OF MY ROOM
😂 Idk anymore 😂😂
Hahah l lived for "you are just mad that you are not on the list"
That was so accurate...! ....XD
Thank you and Love you sm Lilly <333
"It's December." Bwahaha! I'm crying.
Lmao Lilly eating was wrapping paper in the background is MOOD 😂
9 Sleeps till Christmas😁😁💖




Who’s excited???
Issue with lily doing this video is most of her audience are exactly the sort of people she's mocking lmao
Early squad squad where ya at
SEMI EARLY gang lets go👌😅
HOLD UP, ALMONDS PRODUCE  MILK!?!??😱😱😱😱
SO U CAN LITERALLY MILK AN ALMOND
Mind blown💥💥🔥🔥😂😂
Wait... do you think she’s subscribed to T series?!?!
Others: Happy Holidays

Me: Merry ChristmaHanuKwanzaa
Never saw this side of jay... it's hilarious!
The shade at the end.......Can't we move past that please?
Lmao didn't expect this kind of video from Lilly but pleasantly suprised. 👏👏
And i have an accent🤣🤣🤣thank you for that man mad my day
I love you Lily! 🥰
Lilly in a Q&A:
Q: What’s your favourite food?
A: Wrapping paper
"Happy whatever doesn't offend you"

n0t EvERy 1 iS neUr0tYpiCaL!!!11!!!
Ending though ❤️😆
"Getting offended is the biggest trend of the day"...got that right...☕
lmaoooo the forbes joke & LOLLY CASUALLY CHILLING AT THE END HAD ME DEAD 😂😂😂
Collab with Jay Shetty , amazing.
Never seen this lighter side of #JayShetty in any of his videos before.  His is an inspiration and you are awesome #lillysingh , great job
That ending is why I love Lilly so much. Xx
OMFG YES GURL THAT LAST SCENE GURL I AM SHOOKED I AM LITERALLY TYPING THIS UPSIDE DOWN GURL SLAYING THE GAME WITH THAT CLASSY CASUAL SAVAGENESS LOVE YOU BOO
Lilly : If u dont know who this is what are u doing??
Me: Binge watching all your vids.....
"you're just mad you're not on the list"
Lilly: ..
GURL SAME
😂 love the Forbes tweet reference omg

I also have to say I envy how you handle the hate way to clap back
So Lilly u always said u wanted real feedback on your videos...
Moving into scenes, different shots can be more fluid...
Motto: (in unison) Theres something wrong with everything🤗
Leave a like if you are not wearing socks!👍
Why am I here 🤦🏿‍♂️ damn you crowder!
2:43 you see Lilly in the background being Lilly
"she's just mad coz she's not in the list" lolzz
I always believe that instead of saying that we all are same and secretly believing that we are not....let's acknowledge the fact that we are different in many respect since being different is not a crime....nor a matter of shame.
relatable af ♥️
Loving 12 Colman’s of Christmas 🎄
The Forbes reference at 3:00 haha! Good one Lily :)
I think behind the scenes you guys talk in Hindi ;-)
LMAO! I love coming to your channel. I’m impressed everytime! And I loveeee Jay ! Ugh 😍😍
....
I think I’m leaving this channel lmao bye
Hahaha Lilly eating wrapping paper in the background!😂😂😂
OMG jay is is adorable !!!!!! we don't deserve him 😜 and lily is exceptional as alway 😍
This is GOLD! SO funny. 
Much love your way!!
I feel like your a troll🤔
are you a troll 🧐
obama collab wya?!?!?!,,,,,,,,so excited
Jay Shetty- Has an accent
Nevermind that his 'accent' is English, the correct intonation for the English language.
(Not offended, just correcting)
Totally random but.....

👧🏻: As soon as I can...
👦🏼: Will you ever leave me?
👧🏻: No are you crazy?
👦🏼: Do you love me?
👧🏻: Of course!
👦🏼: Have you ever cheated on me?
👧🏻: No never!
👦🏼: Will you ever kiss me?
👧🏻: Every chance I get!
👦🏼: Will you ever hit me?
👧🏻: Definitely not!
👦🏼: Can I trust you?
👧🏻: Yes!
👦🏼: Babe?

Now read this backwards........




Have a good day 😂😂😂
I thought it was LGBTQ2+
OMG THIS IS THE BEST COLLABS I EVER SEEN!!! WITH JAY SHETTY NEVER SEEN HIM THIS HYPE SMILING HERE N THERE LOL :D
2:19 

Lily walks in with verbal consent

I am so glad that you are back on Youtube!
I am DEAD. SO TRUE literally me with my family😂💀
Jay was so free and superb never seen his this part 💙
That is literally me teaching my parents, especially about the lgbt+ community 😂
You make sooo much lemonade out of lemons its hilarious!!😂🤣
The collab we never knew we needed, also I’m so sad I didn’t predict this
His eyes look like Aishwarya Rai's 😍
I really want you to be the most subscribed YouTuber. 😭💗
On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me five golden rings....
You'd have beautiful babies 😭👶❤❤❤❤ 
Best duo ever 
Ps: we're all obsessed with that human being.
Who else is loving these collabs!! (I want her to collaborate with Cardi B or Nicki Minaj Lol)
Lgbtq(i)+

Lilly Singh Shetty.
I love that Lilly just kept eating the wrapping paper in the background. 👍

It's so good to see Jay with you. I love his videos. Thanks Lily ❤️
So ur trying to make jokes about pc and people being offended while u got offended by an inaccurate Forbes list, and made a salty reference to it at the end. ironic

I love you Lilly ❤️ ALL THE TEA, ALL THE SHADE
Wow ! I am a huge fan of both of you! The video is amazing ! You should make more collabs with him!
I am dying🤣🤣
It's OK to be "woke" as long as your not too offended by everything
I love you so much you are my inspiration and you help me cope with my anxiety
Pls do a video collaboration with @matthew hussey
I ship them..
2:45 Lily's  eating wrapping paper in the back😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely amazing!!!!!!
Omg this is the BEST!!!!!😂😂😂
Omg after James Charles, Rita Ora, dr.Phil, Try Guys and now JAY SHETTY? Who's next!!? Lilly is killing the game!
I am so happy our queen is back! 😍
Thank you Lilly for showing this side of Jay to us.
How to offend someone.

Step 1. Say Literally Anything.

Step 2. Wait.
Your vlogmas are the best
Jay is good in this one
the end is a reference to her not being on the forbes list
I knew this collab was coming
Oh my Gosh!! This is SO true!!
Can we ship these two, too? 😍
Woah!! You know EVERYONE dont you?! HAHA! Amazing, as always ^_^
ahhh !so great to see u jay in a different avatar.....😊
This was awesome 😂😂 and so true everything is offensive now
dieselpatches: Lilly Singh is an SJW Femenist Propaganda machine

Lilly Singh: makes a video making fun of all of the pointless things third wave femenists complain about
This is so true omg
I knew Lilly had something up her sleeve, a lot of "Lilly Singh scandal" videos have been poppin up lately and I've been getting annoyed BUT THAT LAST REFERENCE GIRL OOOOOOHH 🔥
0:39 in this shot the mother is wearing a Rosanna Pansino glove
0:40 and in this shot she’s not
the shadeeeee forbes has entered the chat
That last line tho 😂😂😂😂😂
Collab with Camila Cabello and Hayley Kiyoko Please
Loving this :DD hahah so on point
omygod this is sooo accurate 👏👏
THE FORBES REFERENCE I CANNOT ohmygod
Omg living for this
Ummmmmm...its not almond milk, its almonds juice. Using milk is offensive to the dairy community.

LOL I AM KIDDING I loved this video so much!
She needs to do a collab with Hasan minhaj 😁😁😁😁😁
Love you Lilly but that Forbes thing, wow..
The Forbes reference is EVERYTHING
Do a video with the Dolan twins and emma!!!!!!

Like if you agree!
OMG! I love Jay! I always watch his vids! 💖💜💞💕🍀
parents react to thank u next plzplzplzozkzokz
Jay Shetty's eye colour is just PERFECT
You Just Said it!!🤣🤣🤣
People are gonna get mad for me saying this but this video was hilariously and sadly true. Great job Lilly!
That joke /shade list at the end had me in tears ! 😂😭. If u didn’t catch go watch the end she’s referencing the forbes list mess .  I EFFING LOVE HER ❤️
everyone is getting so triggered in the comments🙄
Lily Singh telling people not to be offended is... Quite Ironic
the irony of this video
I never knew this face of Jay😂😍
I LOVE THAT ENDING. I LOVE YOU.
Who ELSE KNOWS DA WAY OF THIS LIFE
Lilly, would you really eat wrapping paper for a video? Would you reeeeaaaallly?? Cuz, I mean...
Clever and funny! Well done!  I don't know this Jay dude, but you two look great together...
Well, don't take things too personally.
To those who wanna add Jay to Lilly's ship, 





ᎻᎬ'Ꮪ ᎷᎪᎡᎡᏆᎬᎠ.
That ending though
I love it!!
Exactly... "Being offended is the latest trend!!!"
This video offends me.
This is beautiful!
this was frickin amazing 😂
3:02 OH SNAP Clapping back to them haters! Love you Lilly
If my parents were photographers
The most relatable video on the internet lol 😂 I luv u lily ❤️❤️❤️❤️
LILY SINGH IS GRINDING!!🍩
Jay is soo handsome 😍
Is this supposed to be ironic or something? U know.. cause... 




It’s coming from Lilly Singh?
Lol look at lily in the background at 2:42 just eating wrapping paper
This is such a great idea! 😂
So glad u both got to know each other
WHO IS THAT ADORABLE ADORABLE MAN
You just triggered me! How dare you! Lol. just kidding. Awesome video! 👍
This is actually so funny 😂 And it is so accurate of people now!!! But I feel like people are going to get mad triggered
No we're not all guilty of getting offended only you Lilly only you😂😂😂
This video is amazing xD
That's random but jay shetty looks like parker from liv & maddie...
Best collab and concept  love u both... jay's eyes uffff tote ud gae mere
Lol 2:45 her in the background IM DYING
"she's Japanese not Chinese"
"What's the difference?"
😂😂😂
Omg that last one was a total shot at imalex 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 brava
Loving that new intro
“Women aren’t that nice...”
“ you’re just mad you’re not on the list.”

Lilly looking into the camera like she’s on the office. 

I felt that look deep in my soul
This is the coolest Christmas collaboration of this year so far! Great job!
Im a day late on the video Oh nu D:
Anyone else notice a similar camera angle compared to Ariana Grande's thank u, next video
Yikes the ending 😂😂
lol soy milk... NO WAY
THAT WAS THE BEST REPLY!
Hi someone scrolling down the comments
What's up
COLLAB WITH ELLEN
No jokes i fell on the ground from laughter lilly should take more breaks like her last one if that is what it takes and that "list" comment in the  end OMG🤣🤣
Why is this so relatable😂
Omg, did anyone get that reference at the end??
Yes, wow love this collaboration, nice lovely video 💓💯
Hasn't CollegeHumor done about 500 skits like this already?
I love you both❤
I don't necessarily agree with Lilly about the Forbes list, but I gotta give it to her. That ending was genius😂
Ah Xmas, another meaningless day where I accomplish nothing.
Watched the making of and was stoked to watch the real deal. Then that last line! I can't handle it, snatched! Thank you for being you, Lilly.
I can't believe people hate on Lilly 
She's amazing and so funny 💜💜
Queeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!  The last scene ❤❤❤❤🔥 🔥 🔥
This is literally one of the funniest video I have seen of any creator in a while 😂😂😂, my God.
I am OFFENDED
* inhales * REEEEEEEE
Someone's out of ideas.
This is brilliant!
I literally love this
Yay!!! What a wonderful collab. Two wonderfully woke people put together. Epic video 😍😭😂
Loved that ending with the Forbes reference. That was clever! And love your HAIR!!!  😍😍
I'm not going to lie, the more PC everything gets the more genuinely scared I get. I have social anxiety, which makes interacting with people that I don't know hard, and PC culture makes it SO much worse. It's gotten to the point where I HAVE to work at night so I can "function" at a basic social level. I fear, as a conservative straight white male, that everything that I have (on my own) worked for will be blown away because I use the "wrong" pronoun, voice my opinion, or even make a joke.


Even worse is the fact that just by saying this I'm: not being PC, I'm being "insensitive", something-phobic, and a Neonazi. Which is ridiculous. But who cares about what I think or feel, I'm just a straight, white, male living on his own off of a minimum wage job that could go up in smoke at any moment should any one person get offended by my existence.
Okay. I'm gonna be that guy. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised to see this video coming from Lilly. Now, I recognize that it's impossible to avoid offending at least one person and sometimes (especially with people from older generations) we have to ease up on our criticisms. However, this video essentially suggests that all of the efforts made to be "woke" presented are excessive and "boring", and yet most of the examples were things that are actually kinda important? Like, knowing people's correct pronouns is definitely going to improve your holiday season because it will make those in your company feel comfortable and not dysphoric and unwelcome. Using more environmentally friendly goods is an important habit because our consumption habits affect the standard of living across the world (my friend lectures me about this all the time and it's hard to hear, but they're right). My point is that I'm sick of people treating caring about other human beings as some laborious task, and I really wasn't expecting to hear it from Lilly. It can be hard to change our habits, and nobody likes to be told they're wrong, but if people could at least be aware of how their habits affect their loved ones during the holidays, I think it would be a much more enjoyable time for all.
This was the best one 😍😍😍
Love the last part about the list cos of the Forbes thing
I unironically appreciate this video.
Okay but a lot of these are valid. You can't call Japanese people Chinese and people do prefer certain pronouns. Love this though <333
the ending KILLED me. I looove a savage queen!! (hope that didn't offend anyone)
Oh please it wasn't just about you being woke over the fact that you weren't on the list, watch goddamn videos  and don't make it into something that would do justice only for you
I love Jay. People should ask him how to live and look at life. You should do a collab with Rupi Kaur if you can!!! I know she’s really busy rn doing performances but maybe soon in like 2019!!
THESE R FACTS PPL GETTING TOO OFFENDED NOWADAYS. PLZ CHILL
I've never seen Jay like this before..what have u done to him Lilly?! Looks like he was forced to do this
2:38 lilly is just snacking on some biodegradable wrapping paper. 😂
best one of the 12 sooo funny <33
I DID NOT EXPECT JAY ON HERE YAY YES
I have a habit of eating paper...🖐️
This video is incredible.

Chidi Anagonye does not approve of your unethical use of almond milk
the internet these days is just like this
OMG, girl this is hilarious and awesome and hilarious 😂. You pick the best people to collaborate with!! I never new this guys and now I'm 100% checking him out. Love you, your amazing 😉!
people deadass being too sensitive
Im glad you took a break from youtube to focus on your mental health by uploading videos. Because this is the only way you can relax and it is very helpful and it was definitely not for views or attention because your channel is not dying, its still doing very well. I hope your break helps you get over this and possibly (hopefully) makes you funny,
the ending was so funny!! that look lilly gave 😂😂
This was a shetty video. lol
Santa's woke too 😂😂😂
Did you notice the reference to the Forbes list situation 




Got to give it to lily on being shady 😎
jeez what a long break you've come back from
Girl this video...yikes
what's up Twitter reference!
"you're just mad you're not on the list... " this is why i love lilly so much... such a savage... :D
Improper use if the word "WOKE".
Ahaha she called out the Twitter drama at 2:54 love her
glad you’ve got your creativity back Lillyyyyy
This deserves more views, but what the heck.. this collaboration is right on.. 😎
Soy milk is better than almond milk bc almond milk has almost no protein
I guess I'm trendy
who else loves LILLY SINGH ??? ✨✨✨



✨also i’m a small youtuber x✨
His eyes are pretty
Ohhh my two favorites!!!! Pls do many many many more video together ♥️♥️♥️MADE MY DAAYYYY
never thought these two will collab
This is the funniest thing ive ever watchdd
I love how lily is just eating the wrapping paper like its totally normal😁😁
This made me smile.

The collabs of Christmas are the best
Can't use almond milk cuz Santa might have a nut allergy. :P
Get Woke needs to be real 😅
Haha the end! “Ur just mad ur not on the list” 😂😂
2:16 "With verbal consent" omg lol
"Everything you tweet now is cringy" lol bye
Ok but consent and helping the environment is important? Not sure why we're making fun of these things but anyway...
I am here for the LAST PUNCH. And the whole video too.
WHO CLICKED ON THIS IMMEDIATELY???
This was so good hahahaa
Ha I missed your videos
I'm offended...😂😂😂🙄😂
I was so annoyed when I saw silly videos claiming everyone hates Lilly Singh and dissing her on Twitter comment about Forbes and how she just wants attention etc.
Funny _ they used her name on their title to get attention
Anyways - awesome way to get back at them Lilly ❤️❤️❤️ You are and will always will be the BAWSE. I became a better person because of you ❤️❤️ Love you to the moon and back
If you really want to get woke this holiday season, don't talk about it. Remember not everybody celebrates Christmas. 😜

Apparently, 1.9k have been offended so far :P
I love how she called out the twitter drama lol!!!!

Thank you Superwoman introducing him, I knew him but didn't knew about his YouTube channel name since I watched Facebook video from a friend... His video is so motivational 🤗 which really awsome thank so.. much 😘
Merry Christmas!!!
So true!! Hilarious!!
Omg 2:37 Lilly eating paper in the background
Yayy another video
Honestly my family needs this
I just realized that so many people get offended by things that sometimes don't even involve them.
‘Who are all these people?!’ 😂😂😂
The list!! Lol good one!
Hmmm I agree with some of it, but I do not agree with some as well
Oh my goodness... What a super huge success of counts subscribers 🎊 congrats 🎉..new friend here hope we meet up hugs too

Definition of IRONY
Lilly what software is used for your animation designs
Checking the comments!?! Replying the video... It's on point 👊
Love you Lilly
Lilly use to be woke but now she woke up! glad to have you aboard!
NO WAYYYYY U GOT JAYSHETTYYYAGHHJFJ IM LOVING THIS COLLAB
Ok but seriously. I say hello and someone somewhere is offended
Every 0.1 second someone gets offended on the internet.

Looks at the comments...
Oh those are nice but no
Forbes list ≠ Santa's list. Get Woke people!
oh my gosh!!!! you look so pretty!! Like if you think lily glowed up
I just noticed u have thr same last name as my classmate
this is 2018 in a nutshell...
Won’t lie this was funny
God... You both are amazing
Oh what we have become. #relate
That moment when u realize how dead this channel is
Remember when Shane did it, good times
I thought that was Jake Paul
Anyone who reads this, have a great future and a lovely day 😄
My favorite video yet good job
broooo im dead😂😂
that shade at the end lmaooo
I just don't think people should be demeaned for suggesting that there is a way to be inclusive. There is something we can all work on. Likewise if someone makes a mistake they shouldn't be degraded either. This whole "offended" narrative is taking away from possible change and advocating silence all for the sake of "being a good sport" or "having a sense of humor" I love Lilly and I'll always watch all her content but this video 😬😬
WHERE'S THE BROKEN LAMPSHADEEEEE
I’m so confused, am I supposed to think being politically correct is annoying or....yeah I’m confused not something I expected from lily I thought she was PC
Lilly is playing with fire here
Claudia is shaking
We live in a different age. There are certain shows that I used to watch that have jokes that don’t age well at all. Not just political incorrectness but, things that are hurtful to large groups of people. I DO think that sometimes political correctness becomes a little too much. I just honestly think it boils down to common sense at the end of the day.
All your videos are so creative I love them they always make me smile !!!
omg the ending, at least u can laugh at yourself
I love your 12 collabs of Xmas❤️❤️❤️❤️
THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH EVERYTHING
I like that santa part especially!!!
That ending though 😂 ..... you wasn’t on the list 😰
Really loved this! well done for pushing the limits...its really refreshing and funny content. Happy holidays! (if you have holidays, if you dont i apologise if i offended :P) Xxx
All these people in the comments being salty and I have no clue what they're on about.... I'm just laughing  at you all equally 😋
I love the reference to her not being on the Forbes list
WHY THE HECC DOES THAT BLOND GUY LOOK LIKE JAKE PAUL
1st comment Love u Lily Love this vid can u plzzzz like my comment
Those people who get offended by everything needs to grow up.
okay great the funny lilly is back
Forbes magazine is quaking, wait was that offensive?
When your religion follows the lunar calendar...
Honestly the only video you've made that i actually found funny. The sarcasm is great here. This is what i call content.
THAT REFERENCE AT THE END THO
Lilly did you bleach parts of your hair??
This is actually pretty relatable. Why the frick do people get so offended so easily? :/
Jay😍
Lmao this is the best thing ever
Best Colab so far
Loved to watch Jay having fun. His videos are of the nature where he can’t appear to be funny, so this was a refreshing watch.
1:40 keep Mohammad out of this please, extremely offended as a Mislim. 
Unsub.
the perfect mental break
Something that needed to be SAID.
WHERE IS SUPER MONDAY??
Jay Shetty is so adorable!!! 😍😍
Lilly eating the wrapping paper in the background is honestly me at this point in the semester.  Send help
Lol there's 'still' people triggered by her old Forbes List tweet?
This is so true
This is so true
hahaha love u Jay Shetty...Nd Superwoman
Lol this was hilarious
This video ended too early 😖
I lived for this video also exactly why i dont like the majority of followers on the internet
She had to deal with mental issues instead make 12 collabs! Jesus
This was a huge turnaround for you. And I like it!
Hahahahaha love ✨
People who are not woke are actually the wokest of them all.
Fight me.
Oof
😂😂😂 this was too funny
Marry Christmas 🎄 🎁
This is soooo goooood!!!!😂
First☺️☺️☺️
Get woke 😂😂😂
Love it! But, Soy isn't high in estrogen nor harmful for health.
This video seems to mock both sides so you don't know how to feel
0:34 Me trying to tell my parents BTS are Korean
Me: They're Korean not Chinese
Dem: What's the difference?
Yo this was cringey
0:33 THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OK IS IT JUST ME
Hahaa the new face of jay shetty
DEAD!!! That last bit got me sooo hard! Brilliant 😂😂😂😂😂#thelist
Background music name please
Lilly is right. It's good to know what's right and it's good to be inclusive, but you do NOT NEED to be politically correct and inclusive ALL the time. It's more like a burden on people's lives now, rather than even being something that people understand. It puts people in this anxiety box that if they go wrong with one fact, they're doomed.
love this, it`s important to be aware, but sometimes things go toxic, cancel culture needs to go
Omg Lilly I love you so much! You are so inspiring and amazing!!!❤️
Can you say outrage tactics?
I ship
OH HI IM EARLY
This has been the cringiest video I've ever watched. 
I never expected myself to say that, but Superwoman is no longer funny.
DO A COLLB WITH GABBIE HANNA!!
The best part of that video was the ending hahaha
if I can trick you, you have to like

Jay Shetty..oh man .. the smile and hyperactive attitude you carried through out this act ,with that expressions..Especially your expression when you said butterflies instead of snow angel.. 😍you stole the show.. couldn't see anyone other than you..(my first lengthy comment )
Ahhhh I love jay. Shetty
Lily Singh is T-Series's daughter
I never seen Jay Shetty so funny😂😂😂
Lol true
Ish
People who say “woke” should be tortured mercilessly
I thought I was woke, so much I don't know, found out I was just coming out of REM sleep.
Good stuff!
Lilly i love you, but i haven't enjoyed the collabs so far this year as much as I have loved all your previous content- BUT DON'T STOP, KEEP GOING COZ MORE SUPERWOMAN VIDEOS ARE BETTER THAN NONE! :) AND you are so talented
Why why why Lilly!?? I am a huge fan n will forever be but the content of this video was bleh frankly... I hope n pray things get better soon!!
Whew, chilaaayyy.... Lilly, I get your intent- I do. I does seem like people are easily offended these days. A lot of times, people read too deep into things. I get the message of the video but, the beginning examples aren’t examples of people being overly offended. There was actually nothing wrong with the corrections that the kids were making. That instantly put a bad taste in my mouth. Your intent was clear but, I think the beginning soured the rest of the video. Just my humble opinion🤷🏽‍♀️
May b it's that I'm seeing jay coz Jay shetty is kind of an inspiring person.. I find it less funny than Lily's other videos.
I AM THE 3
They look like siblings lol
Everyone that said hateful thing to her is actually the offended one. lol
this video is a power move
Forbes reference
That was great!!!
i love this too much
IM OFFENDED
Lilly, this was poorly scripted.
Sadly so true what is the world coming to!
This is so cringy...
This is hilarious!! And it's not like Lilly has made these jokes before.
I love this so much!!!!
Basically feminazis (not feminists) in 2018
Woke level 10
This was quite funny but I didn’t like the other hired actors ( no offense😭😂) just prefer your old team x
I'm reading all of the comments, and I really think some people don't understand what satire is.
Love it hahah. I wish it was a bit longer
Ive never seen anyone so happy to eat wrapping paper
ew, coming from Lilly this is just not..... no
the joke of the video isn’t making fun of inclusivity, it’s satirizing the way some people on both sides of the issue communicate with each other: the people who hate “pc culture” so much they won’t acknowledge anything they say to be offensive, even confusing two totally different countries, because they can’t be bothered with even the most simple corrections; but she’s also critiquing those “SJW”s who can be so unrealistically impatient with people who are trying to learn/grow/adapt to be considerate and inclusive of others, only to jump down their throat at the first sign of error, ignoring any well-intentioned progress along the way, shouting “you can’t say that!” rather than explaining  what they said could be hurtful to someone. 
so for those who don’t “get it”, the point is that both sides can be wrong- some people need to be more open to the idea that, yes, sometimes they’re wrong and being open to criticism isn’t a persecution, BUT those doing the criticizing can be more kind and tolerant of the learning curve people have, especially with those (like our older relatives) who are making an effort to take in lots of new information, but clearly aren’t hateful. 

moral of the story: Lilly just wants us to laugh, so laugh and admire her effort to tackle something polarizing, or keep it moving and don’t put more negativity into the world- she doesn’t need that, no one does.
Perfect
And Lilly can you please so ariana grande
Can someone tell what is so wrong about being P.C cause i dont see it , if there a way we can talk and not hurt i'm all for it
P.s. I'm not refiring to the vid but the comments section .
Ok ngl I don’t stan this
Omg collab with Adam Saleh
1:08 do we suppose to laugh
Look people u got nothing nice to say don't say it at all even if u have "intentions"
♪ everythings offensive, everything is triggered to being so mean. everythings offensive. ♪
Hahahahaha... Cannot stop laughing
two of my most favorite youtubers
this is cool
Merry Christmas everyone!
I have no idea who Jay Shetty is. Never heard of him.
This says gen z all over  it
" your just mad your not on the list"
This is good
Thank you Lilly 😱..I'm obsessed tooo
Patriarchy can unite us!
Show me a man who takes by force what he wants from women and I'll show you 10 women who vote to take by force what they want from men. Show me a grave created by patriarchy and Ill show you an entire graveyard created by feminism/communism.

Wait so Lil did u get that light fixed?
I’d rather be dead than be “woke”
“It’s December!” 😂
nailed it
😂😂😂 #GetWoke!
THE LAST CLIP WITH THE LIST!!!!!!! OH MY GOD YASSS QUEEENNNN!!!!! TELL THEMMMM 😭😭😭😭😭
I don't really understand what's going on.
I have no idea what's I just watched...
Skittle Boys is in the comments!  Why does this feel like Work aka. A Job lol get consent!
Lilly's face at the end when she he said "Your just mad your not on the list" 😂😂.
Hopefully I can reach 2K by Christmas! If you could just like this post, it could get attention and get exposure! Happy Holidays and God Bless You All!
The fact that some people don't go along with certain ideologies doesn't necessarily mean that they don't know about them or understand them. People have the right to decide.
That tea at the end tho
Lollll the Forbes list 😂
Merry Christmas! This video is NOT Funny!
There is no one on the list
1:55 i thought that was the normal wrapping paper
Loved the video but kind of sick of people abusing the fact that we are less offensive than ever now. Yes, somtimes it goes overboard, but a 10 is better than a zero. Things arent "too pc". Anyways...
Happy holidays guys! 🌲❄⛄🎅🏂🎿🍪
Everyone in the comment section getting offended lol you just proved her point
This is one of her best videos in in a long time
Liberals eh?
Haha love it!
I feel sorry for you.. 😪
3:01 reference😏
So funny. So true. Especially the lgbt+ I thought was funny because that was basically my family’s reaction lol
Do you make any money on these videos if they’re not 10 minutes long?
It's funny how people are offended by this too, lol.
That was so funny!!! 😂😂😂
The Forbes reference though
This should be the last one. lmao Ending the year with some truths.
This was disturbing
It's time we archive religions. Press F and pay respects. 

It has served it's  purpose. These days it's doing more harm than good. Honestly people are just using it to provoke others and they clearly know it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yaaay! Jay Shetty!!! 🙌🏼❤️
lmao she was just casually eating wrapping paper in the background im ded
I Loved this video man!  I was waiting for a video about people who get offended easily.THANK THE LORDS!!!superwoman to the rescue.
Says the person getting offended by not being in a list cuz they dont make good content
Jay Shetty on Lilly's xmas collabs. Could this get any better?! _
I saw what you did there  2:55
I like the part where she eats wrapping paper.
Comedy gold.  Her comedy is only for people with a very high IQ
the ending thooo
Facts man people need to chill out way to sensitive these days you can hardly say hello to people without them getting offended
THIS IS AWESOME ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
I looove youuuu superwomaaaan
Didnt you just leave youtube ?
JAY💟🎈
That chin omg those eye. He is one fortunate looking person
this one is quite funny
I loveeeeerr thisssss😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I don't understand, lily took a break to become unfunny? Ok.
i love you
I'm not saying i would punch a younger relative for saying mind the pronouns  am however saying I would disown them....Oh the line of comments I hope I get is gonna be a warzone
Loved this video ..... 😁😁
Idk what everyone is on about cause I genuinely found the video quite funny! And side note: SHES KILLING 12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS.
No....just no
She forgot that Santa could be a lactose intolerant!!!! Ugh no milk
Seen a new funny side of Jay Shetty......
Hahahahhahahahahaha the shade
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNqsT1iOo-_KryIF7UCX40A
I don't understand why aren't her videos getting as many views it used to get. I love to watch her and this breaks my heart.
It's strange she isn't seeing the irony here especially with the recent forbes list  about youtuber earnings
I'm loving the collabs
This isn't even accurate lol. She spends so much time throwing shade at today's youth smh
When I saw this I was like Heck Yes!!!
You should let your parents react to the thank you next music video by ariana grande
LMAOOOO THE ENDING. IM DED. THE ENDING.
Loved it
Wow I’m so early love ❤️ you Lilly
🤣😂😂🤣 that's the best video on YouTube today
Omg I hope those cookies were also gluten free
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣☠️
I love the 12 days of Christmas series
His eyes 😳🙈😍
lgbti??? intersex arent lgbt, as they aren't trans. its offensive to intersex people tha-







this is a joke oof
It’s not Happy December it’s Whatever you’re feeling December 😂
Love you superwoman love your content😋😋
Only here because lily's hot
oof the Chinese/Japanese thing actually hurt
Get Woke, Go Broke.
I love u lilly u make me feel so happy I've have changed my life for the better since I started watching you I love you so much I wish I could buy your merch or u could come to Idaho it is my dream to meet you I love you so much
The reference at the end tho 😂😂😂😂
You act so woke it’s actually annoying stop acting like you aren’t like this
I LOVE THIS VIDEO, ESPECIALLY THE SHADE AT HERSELF AT THE END AYYAYAYYAYAYA
I maybe died in the end. Anyone get the reference??
Cursed ..
Actually kids these days are more sleepy than woke.
Girl thank you for coming back❤️
I'm confused. The script is weak. Is this supposed to be mocking the kids who are correct? Because the initially examples with the kids are actually not getting offended at 'nothing'. The kids are justified. And then you go on to create a guide where you mock being correct?
#2018bitchduh
All facts lol
I dont get the message of this one, it seems to be making fun of people who are offended by “everything” but half of the examples you use are actually bigoted and should stop being said. I kinda thought you shared this view, but I guess not?
I'm just callous and jealous  to watching it..
Uh oh I don't think the majority of your audience is going to take this well... :"D  But I enjoyed it, finally some good comedy from you! (Y)
So true
Get woke, go broke!
💛💛💛💛💛
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Dope
Wow there is so much negativity in the comment section in Lily's videos now. I also see that many people are not understanding what the meaning of the video actually is, and are just criticizing it. Kinda sad to be honest.
fantastic
"Differently abled"? Are they really calling people like this? Well, I´m not American of course...been crippled since birth and now it seems that someone is pointing out that I can not play piano while some other person can....:P I think that we are all differently abled :D Not a good expression, but certainly it does not ruin a good comedy....so thank you for the video!
1:36 that look though😏
Get woke go broke
https://youtu.be/e1UbyGNg-A0
Get woke go broke.
Only here cuz of skullfxck sips tea
Lilly singh is horrible
All the top comments are people being offended 😂
I wonder how many times she had to eat paper
What is if soy milk is just regular milk introducing itself in Spanish....???
This offended my snow globe
i don't get it?
I wish this was a joke, but then I looked that Lily made this video.
This is sad
Omg !!! Asjdbdhdbhdjsnabxhkcnd  I just found out abput Jay's channel 2 days before this video was up and the first thing that came to my was that there is nothing better than Jay and Lilly in one video..... And omfg it's here 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Nice one  guyz...
THE SHADE SHE THROWS AT 3:00 AT ALL THE HATERS IS AWESOME.
showing this to my mom lol
I agree I’m 11 and basically everyone in my school gets a fended soo easily
ok, ik that this is meant 2 b a joke but she took it 2 a extreme level. merry december? ik its in this video but it sin other 1s 2. im getting sick of this now and im 1 of her biggest fans.
i loved the ending. LMAO!!!
Very cheeky at the end :D
https://youtu.be/MMDUDXjG4aI
This video offends me..........
OH MY THAT ENDING! 🙌🏿🙌🏻🙌🏼🙌🏽🙌🏾 XD
LOVEEE THESSSE OML
Most of her audience are the types that DO get offended.
You need to do you and Colleen Ballinger
I’m just gonna,,, I can’t,,,, Alright lilly.
At this point of time, I would be more surprised if nobody gets offended 😏
sensitive people/ impatient people are the worst.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Lily this wansnt good it actually came across as pretty offensive
Seriously, I'm waiting for the day when ppl will get offended for the way I breathe....it can't be too far smh. It's good to be woke but there's also something called overdoing it.
I ABSOLUTLY LOVED THIS....so true
This is ... Messy.
Woke
Nah nope can’t see that happiness in your eyes superwomen I love you cheer up come on..
Get woke go broke
It's nice to be woke
😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
I'm offended by people getting offended by non-offensive things. Which leads to me offending myself. I've come full offence circle.
what happened to lily after her "break"? She talked about mental health, and I was happy she was taking some time off; she seemed real stressed and overworked. Being a subscriber for four years now, i'm being honest w/ you girl: your videos are completely swallowed in clickbait, unoriginal content. Don't take the constructive criticism for hate, just worried 'bout you. Please talk about why you didn't really go on a break. We all love you and wanna support you, but you need to be honest w/ your supporters. Still love you:)
first like ayeaye
0:32 but Chinese and Japanese ARE different
I love this video
3:02 That's the face I make the majority of the time
Ohh Ahh Yay
So much attention for Christmas tell us what attention do you give on GURPURB!!
124 comment
Lily. I. Frikin. Love. This. Serries... 
I. Am. So. Happy. Your. Back
This was such funny collaboration. I watch Jay Shetty videos, he’s a good human being. Lily and Jay are so cute together, they make such a cute couple.
claps
Right now its just the commenting section.. WHY IS THAT? Like there is no recommended section??
How did that paper taste
Whoa, I wanna be woke!
so needed
LOVE!!!!!
i guess this redeemed you. Sorry for ever doubting you
😂😂😂😂
when you use mental illness as an excuse to plan collabs
Wow, didn't really expect this collab !!!
ILY OMF WORD
I find oversensitivity to comedy very offensive. You better get woke and start living your life the way I want you to.....*massive eye roll*
Press this button it will turn blue!!!
👇
JAYYY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just disown them.
An inclusive christmas!!!LMAO!!!
One thing you forgot: almond milk allergies. You can't leave those poor allergic children out 😱
awwwwww slick,lilly, reeeal slick. ilysm
Angles are boys and girls
😂😂😂
Happy whatever ya celebrate!
Did anyone else spot those Rosanna Pansino oven mits? 💖💖
So it’s a parody of herself?
THUMBS UP if you think this queen should rap with this king!!
Finally
I think people are missing the point. I think she's making fun of people who talk about PC culture indirectly saying how they think .
This means ur break is over ?
THE END HAD ME DEAAD 😂😂😂😂. LMAOOO
Um... a little offended, not gonna lie
I'm offended
So funny lol. My kid's don't go to that extreme
wow lilly is soooooooo beautiful in this video!!!!
Tbh, I love how we as collective have this ''Cancel'' power over pretty much anything, I know it can be also used for bad but, it's like, Microsoft/Apple/Coca-Cola/Netflix/Uber/Any Major Company did something bad and want to get away with that bc they have more power than individual people?...well,  ''Hold our beer''.
You're the reason we have school shooters.
Superwoman to the rescue... get woke
😂😂😂😂😂
great video lilly x
There is nothing wrong with being white :)
Love this!
love love love
SAVAGE!!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍
good job
reeee
I know that this is a comedy skit, but please stop perpetuating the myth that soy is "high in estrogen" 😒
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Didn’t lily make a video exactly like this concept last year with Shane?
❤❤❤
You are the only one I can relate  to  because this is basically do all day. Talk to my self while doing a skit. Thx Lilly Singh
Merry December!
Haha I can’t see colour
What?????
Is this an ad
The fact that my best friends’ great uncle is in this video is kinda wild. It’s also funny because my friend knows nothing about YouTube, meanwhile her old relative is literally IN a YouTube video
I know getting angry at everything someone says isn't okay, but some things need to be recognized as not okay. I thought this account was different but I guess not
This is the kind of humor the internet needs today. This is one of the many Things I don't get about people.
Look I believe I am aware/woke and all, but people do take things a little too far. Sometimes it good to be aware of people's intention and give people the benefit of the doubt.
😂😂😂

I get how it’s abt how people get too “offended” but verbal consent, helping the environment and the lgbtq+ community is valid. This could’ve been a good video if it was more intelligent. lmao I know I sound like one of those too offended ppl but I just want Lilly to make better content
end  was epiccccc.
Get woke, go broke.
I’m offended by everything and nothing at the same time
Jay Shetty is 💖💖💖💖
TTEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I remember when comedy used to make me laugh
Honestly I think we’re all tired of eVeRyThInG iS tOo pC jokes... just respect people and don’t whine when people ask for it... pretty simple y’all
It’s December!!!
Jay shetty is hot lol
preach!
This is perfect!! I love both you and Jay because you're geniuses! And Lilly I can see your old creativity coming back love!!💚💚
this is so great. my parents died
Yea, this video just makes me sad that this is the reality of things. Honestly i just want to stay positive and be happy, if you’re not happy that’s by choice not circumstance. There are people in this world with every reason to be happy, but they aren’t. So be happy, please for your sake and everyone else’s sanity
A word straight from Maysoon Zayid - Say disabled. It is not an insult but an identity.
I LOVE YOU LILLY I WAS WATCHING YOU SINCE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!
This video is so offending... Lol jk
Girl I love you!!! people getting extra sensitive lately, or I guess it is the new trend
Wasn’t funny;)
I'm sending this to my mom
The only one that confused me was the Japanese/Chinese thing. Cuz there’s definitely a difference...
I'm offended
She kinda overdid it
Honesty in your vlogs you sound so much happier and really just confident!
😘😘😘😘😘😘
ha get woked
Shade........
Am I the only one who didn’t get any of that??!! lol like if you agree
I guess left wing puritanism isn't as lucrative on the internets these days so now we're appropriating right wing comedy. I think I'm a little triggered.
cough Forbes cough
Woke?... ugh...
IT'S NOT DISABLED  🍌 ♿
 IT'S DIFFERENTLY-ABLED 😵
  😬
I HATE woke people 
They take everything so seriously!
Like race, ethnicity, hair colour and so on. Like calm down!
Love it
I think it is intriguing how abnormally hate the Christian religion I thought you were going to be just a tiny bit nice towards something you don’t agree with

But who am I to talk?
“It’s December!”
The irony 
You're the most offended one lol
Jay shetty ❤❤❤❤❤
what madness getting offended over nothing tis america not Hitlers idea of Germany or the world
That ending got me LOL LOL And I love lil mama's accent!.....Who's mom is that? I bet it's in the vlogs...Hold on lemme check...
I want them to marry
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No it’s depression
Nonce
Jay shetty is soooo cute! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I kept a straight face the whole video, So is this supposed to be funny?
I enjoyed this video. Most of these issues you should be offended by, for example the environment (biodegradable is good, right?) and the ethnicities (Japanese and Chinese are different just like American and British), but even though I belong to a minority race, I don't take much offense as people are people. Love you Lilly and Jay!!!
Lilly is pretty smart imo, bringing everyone here to comment on her being offended by everything has gotten her so many move views than if she had said nothing
LGBTQ is 🤢🤮🤮🤮
First
Wow so many view in 1 minute 😑😑
Jay Shetty
👑😝💖
This video was downright Shetty. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
these comments are exactly why this video is a thing.
tf is this
Nonsense
Don’t get too political. There’s no humour in it.
I wish you could go back to making videos like when you did years ago. Those were the funniest... when it was just by yourself and not with a team.
I think I get the point of the video, in my opinion it’s that some people just aren’t educated in certain things. No one is perfect.
Sorry babe, but becoming self-aware doesn't excuse your actual "wokeness". Now go make me a sammich!
Real
i have been following lilly for years but tbh I don't know what happened but she lost her humor?? maybe it's just me. I haven't really enjoy her content at all for months now....
Can plzzz anyone tell me what she is really trying to do in video cause its so boring that I dont want to pay attention at all ... ¿¿¿
Are you making fun of yourself for how you reacted to the Forbes list? Genuine question. No hate.
💜💜💜
damn u 52 ppl who disliked the video
I bet u don't even know how hard it is to put sooo much effort in this one video
Do you even know your audience?
Seriously, Lilly?

Haha, funny.😐

I normally love your videos, but I didn't appreciate this one.
1:55 How the heck did they not laugh while recording that? Huh must be the woke.
Get woke! This is America we say MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! You can practice your faith but don't complain about it.
I liked the actual video and examples cause that kinda made sense but the initial opening examples didnt make much sense these things should be respected bc if this person is ur friend u want them to feel welcomed and included the rest was fine thou
It hurts me that Lilly's views have gone down. Like, she's so talented.
Jay shetty purrrrty eyes
Ahem. It is disabled and definitely, for crying out loud, like really able bodied people need to stop doing it now, not differently abled. Read up on it. The community hates that term. Also specially abled. Just stop using those terms. Disabled is a term the community identifies with and consciously uses. Not using it is exactly the ableism the community is fighting to stop! Not listening to the community is a way of saying 'no you are differently abled, so you don't know what you are saying, listen to me now!'
ha, ha. so funny..
Weren’t you taking a break from YouTubing?
Not funny not relevant....Lilly why are you spool distant
0:38 why is tht me when my mom asks if im listening to those "Chinese boys" when bts is on
"You're just mad that you aren't on the list." Omg. That is a secret reference to the tweet that she made about not having any women on the "richest youtubers" list. Remember? When everybody got mad at her?
Who’s jay shetty
Hey Lilly youre so hot! could you make a video of you smoking cigarettes in a bakini with red lipstick? I would ash that like butgon so many times for a video of you smoking
U deserve more views...
me: breathes
person:I'm vegan.
yo ya need to chill in the comments wtf.
||Supertranny||
So sexist like omg doesn't include men enough can't believe there aren't any men on the list blah blah blah blah blah
she’s lost so much humor. i’m actually sad
Lily singh alt-right? I thought you were better than that
It's called a joke and humor. Stop being soft
It’s not difficult to understand what  identities/ sexualities/ romanticities (or lack there of) within lgbtqa+ .. I didn’t really get what was so funny about ppl using the correct pronouns either tbh.
I legitimately don't understand. This video makes me think she's making fun of the "get woke" and politically correct mentality. But she's for that right? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
Why is lilly getting so much criticism lately?
For one there is a difference between Japanese and Chinese. Also you are mocking people for offending people that literally are called 5,000 different pronouns. Maybe try to take a look at where other's views are coming from before posting a video
бэ бэ бэ бэ фак инглиш дебилы.
Being hypersensitive is a first world problem  and is associated with mental sleep and group think, the opposite of being "woke".
Hey Lilly, love your channel and your message of loving all kinds of people...Don't know why this video seems to be defending people who claim Chinese and Japanese people are the same? Doesn't seem to be a good example of overly sensitive people being offended by nothing; that's a genuinely ridiculous thing to say, not something that's "suddenly wrong" for politically correct "snowflakes." Don't think you meant anything by it, but maybe think your jokes through a bit more.
You know what’s less funnier than women? Liberal women
I don't agree with you about the environmental thing. It's not about being 'politically correct': it's about not needlessly harming the planet and the animals and people on it. That's just basic ethics.
Pls. Everyone saying "OK 2018 is over, 2019 will be the year we will change". No its not true. Nothing will change. People Will never change. It hurts my ears when people tell me this is a new year for u bla bla bla bla.. Open your eyes.
I'm confused? Some of these things are actually important like helping the environment, because that is a serious issue (ya know, pollution and stuff?). So is calling people by the right pronouns because that can really affect the mental health of others. And the Chinese Japanese thing didn't really make sense either, because they aren't the same thing. I just don't get how this was meant to be funny? Guess its not my type of humor. Not offended, I just don't get how this is comedy.
Edit - I love Jay Shetty and Lily btw
The majority of the examples you used are things that are serious.  I agree that we shouldn’t as you said cancel people.  As long as people are emotionally correct I’m fine and just gently correct them as many people in this video did.  I understand the message and appreciate the humor thanks.
Jay Shetty  omg omg ong😭😭😭😭
I find this extremely ironic
Maybe you should just grow some thick skin 🤔







Oh I’m sorry, are you offended?
Hahah get it shes mad she not on the list that women is not on ahaha like to top payed yters
Hasn’t she made a video out of her own offense ... like all the time????
I can’t with my great grandmother 😂 she is like “what is that community? The LGTB? The LGB32? The LGBBQ?” They might as well add the whole alphabet 😭😭
I used to like her videos, I just think she doesn't really know how to play with irony. I know she's in favour of all these changes and on the side of those who get offended but I think the irony points to criticizing the awaken group rather than the asleep one, it comes out all wrong
It’s December
Just came back at the vlog and can’t stop laughing at 0:48 when he throws the cup!!
Vogue.
😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌
It’s weak because she does this herself trying to be woke
Lilly, that's like ordering a pizza on Christmas Eve and not telling the delivery person that the house numbers are obscured by no numbered cultsacs it will make a delivery driver grow more just guessing where the house is? Give Pizza delivery people a tip! They are people too.
Haha that last diss at yourself
I have not watched any of your videos in like a year or so now. Soooooo...... unsubscribed for good. Bye :)
Some of these were funny and over exaggerated but there were also some that are actually offensive and ppl need to stop saying them :( I love all of superwoman's videos but I think this was my least favourite
what's wrong with telling ppl to use the right pronouns, lgbtq+ community and saying not all Asian countries are the same? oh and also using green-friendly products
Hello white lady, Japanese and Chinese are not the same... it's like I'm telling u British and Americans are the same
i dont get the last part can someone explain it to me
When you have 14M subscribers 
And your video got only 500k views 
You know that ur channel is dead 💀
Jesus loves you, read John 3:16  and Romans 10:9
So this is what you were actually doing when you “took a break” from YouTube for your “mental illness”.
I feel bad that this offended me.....
When you try to make content about mocking 'woke' people while trying to push your own political agendas, and get offended by things less severe than those presented in your content. Legendary.
superb
Its the same thing that happened with the movie elf. Everyone got offended and so now say bye to the best Christmas movie ever
I LOOOOOOOOOVVVEEEEEEEE THIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSS SLAY QUEEEEN 😂😂😂😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️🎄🎄🎄
this kind of video coming from the girl who said that the youtube algorithm was sexist
Lillllly crakes a joke , dum dums can’t get it. I see heaps of dum dum spreading negativity.
Damage control attempt. Lol
Lol
At least she can make fun of herself
Can y'all just shut up? Clearly this video was made as a joke.
The NWO wants us to live in a pink World I always  prefer to say what I want no mater Who get ofended.  I dont like chinese  people  atitude for example but I will never do bad to them.  I am free to think this way
Right I am in middle school and I feel like anything I say to those emotional freaks they get so dame sad, mad, and even scared 😓😓😓😒
I do it sometimes too.
But I am like one of the kindest kid in the school that is what people I don't know that much think (not what my friends think though)🤣🤣🤣
It's funny because Superwoman tried to say there is a wage gap on youtube based upon list posted by Forbes which was purely estimation. I used to like her content a lot but it seems that she's trying to include herself in movements in an attempt to increase her popularity.
Americans get offended so easily I don’t know why
Jay Shetty looks like  Mrwhosetheboss and Grant from TKOR
If yall didnt get it..  lillys videos arent always for comedy, she always gives a message too. Appreciate her work(:   respectful and understanding as always. if you dont like her, why did you even come?. Seems like u need a disclaimer for everything these days.
Judy Magirin left this comment two days ago: Isn’t it ironic that this video is about not getting offended, and everyone is getting offended in the comments? 

I just thought it needed to be said more than once.
Change your title to “Everything you do is sExiSt”
This video largely applies to you, Lily
Ironic
was this suppose to be funny because i didn't laugh once.
What do you mean this didn’t even reach a million views?! THIS IS PERF
Dead channel
i luvvvv lilly's face in the last!!! shes sooo daaaammmmmiiit doooppppee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So what’s wrong with White Christmas??
The dumbest thing is when the left is making fun of itself, and is still left. How self aware do you have to get to realize you're in the wrong?
Let's criticize how our generation has become more aware
It’s true. Chinese, korean, Japanese are different
lol, I know this is supposed to be funny, not offended. But, Christmas is the celebration of the Birth of Jesus Christ. Just Sayin. lol
908 butthurts disliked the video 😂
What a wonderful family I hope you become and you support my channel is very small😢😢😢😢😢
😬
So, 2 things: 
-differently abled is the offensive one, disabled being considered a "bad word" is what's the problem. 
-I didn't laugh this entire video. This is what you took a month long break for?
Apparently 800k views video is considered a dead channel now... Kids these days.
Girl, this is freaking hilarious 😂 never stop making your happy, hilarious content 😌 because every time it makes my DAY! 😍
Lol Jay is great actor too😝 So cool!!! Someone looking so handsome
"And I have a accent" 🤣
Recently discovered Jay Shetty. He's a very inspiring person. Def worth the follow on social media
lol the shade at the end
Jay ❤❤
I love this
I know that ending is Taylor Swift approved.
“There’s something wrong with everything!” I cackled waaay too hard!
That dad actually sang hella good???? Damn
It's not a bad thing to get offended. That just means you care about something. How you choose to act upon those feelings however, can be.
Damn,she even got Jay Shetty here Stan
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH the list
So many people already being offended by the video thinking shes pointing out the things shes saying are wrong, look at her own comment, she obv believes in doing the things being said here the problem is you people who literally get offended by it and some of your comments just prove the point
Lol
Wait I don’t get what’s wrong with what the kids are saying in the first three clips? Like I know some ppl are rly touchy and sensitive about the left but neither of those first two clips weren’t kids getting offended they were just saying things and the third one was an accurate statement? I’m confused
Uh. No. This video is offensive to me and my 34 non-existent parrots. I'm disappointed in you, Lily.
Watch the vlog. It is hilarious. Poor Taylor.
Personally, I am not offended nor annoyed by this. But please try to keep this a comedy channel, and not turn it into politics. I notice that much of your newer content has commented on politics. I love you and want to keep watching. I do not think the point of this video was well made, nor do I think many of your more recent videos have been well made. There are some serious issues that don't need to be turned into satires or sarcastic remarks. It is okay for people to be offended without people jumping on them and telling to toughen up, and that it was "just a  joke". I agree that some things are just jokes and that people do get offended too easily though. But that is not always. I am having trouble finding the humor that is buried in political shades and shames. If you need to take a break to find yourself again, I fully support you in that. I know you have the talent that it takes to be a YouTuber, and I want the most success for you.
I hope someone realises how smart this video is. She makes fun of our generation by showing how it is obviously good that people are more "awake" but how sometimes it is just a bit too much. And, she makes fun of herself at the end. She knows this video applies to her as well so she makes a joke about her being "offended" buuut at the same time showing that what she got "offended" about is actually an issue. LAYERS. she smart. y'all just don't get it.
These two are the most inspiring people in my life... and seeing them collab is like😍😍😍😍😍
2:55 FUJJ YAH THAT EXPRESSION
He is actually the most woke dude on the internet. (PS I use dude for all genders.)
This is the best collaboration ...I have seen ever....my two most inspiring person togather....love u Jay ad superwoman
Dude I ship them
nice  video 
#Dasalbum
Amazing video. And that end tho 😂😂😂
Omg Jay Shetty!!!!!!
Omg I love this!!! I love jay sherry and U!!!!!! U two are my fav youtuber!!!!!
Isn't it stay woke though XD?
Are you going to post after Christmas
Plz plz Cardi B
Lilly did u really eat wrapping paper??
Woo the shade though
😂
It’s December!😂
Was that supposed to be funny?
This is the most unfunny and cringy anti-Christmas video I’ve seen in a long while. Three minutes I’ll never get back
Is it just me or are Lilly’s videos getting worse after she took that break
This was supposed to be funny?
Okay now this is real! 😂😂😂😂😂
I committed Seppuku after watching for a 1min
Best Birthday Collab!
Omg the satire in the video is tooo real XDD that's talent
" Happy whatever doesn't offend you. "
😂😂the ending did it for me... I can already see the superwoman haters throwing pile after pile of hate
Omg he motivation guy I just discovered a few days ago!
Omg!! I love jay!! Never knew he can be so funny!!
“ I look at people and don’t see colour” 
😂😂😂who else thought of Michael Scott then
I got that reference.
I mean I imagined that one day this was going to happen. ....but then I thought it might not be possible. ....but see. .......thus is one of my favs ☺
Am i the only one who was confused till the end...
I can smell the triggers
Ooh the shade 😂😂
Ok i got triggered by tat asian thing
Girl you get offended by everything....and this vedio was kinda cringy.....
||Superfeminist||
So inclusivity is a bad thing..??
I do not understand anything from this video
She’s so childish, at the end making a joke about the people who called her out for something clearly wrong. Check your privilege
Amazing too see you both collab. Make more videos together 😘
First time I seeing jay in a comical role, must say he is looking super cute! Also has anyone else noticed lilly eating wrapping paper in the background and the Forbes reference though 🤣😂
I'm sorry but I laughed before watching this video and it's literally happening right now lol 

I wonder what's next for 2019 😂😂
Holy moly Lily...that last part..........
This is why I like you so much...! You don't put out fire with more fire or oil, but you did the most freaggin' right thing and it's both savage and polite imo lolol
Oh my god Jay is such a real mood. I'm so used to one camera angle Jay, all these winks and cheeky grins are stuff of my dreams 😍😍😍😍😍
also his message is always on point but you already knew that right?
his eyes are SO PRETTY
i dont think people have realized that the queen has returned
My favorite couple I love them boooooooooth
This video was too woke for my life XD
This is so great!
LoVED loVEd lovED this VideoOOOOO 💃💃💃 😘😘😘
This sounds familiar...
😘🌹❤
yeah I hate everyone getting offended over everything, as if their brain stops working and they dont realize when ppl make honest mistakes or are just joking around. Getting more offended just creates a more hostile world.
I just realized internet has brainwashed all of us to being this woke. We need to chill sometimes lol
Lmao
That diss doeee
If you press this button it will turn blue don't hate
👇
its really sad you see you dying slowly. you are becoming irrelevant and desperate..
But trying to save the environment and make society more inclusive are no bad things, right..? This video doesn't really make sense to me. It's like a remake of the collab with Shane, but you're not so much making fun of people being too offended by harmless stuff. More like you're making fun of people that care about being inclusive and respectful and try to make our lives more diverse.
That one person: this video is way to offensive.
😂😂
The end tho.... we stannnnnn😂
The ending 😭
Lijay or Jayly
Luv this so much
Love u 💛
Lmao the list joke 😂
** Almond milk is worse for the environment than real milk. Use oat milk - there you go!
Omg, I love it!
Did anyone else notice the forbes reference at the end? That shade tho 😂 lysm Lilly
Skip to 2:55 
Issh just got real!!! Total redemption
Love you Lilly!
differently-abled👌
That was awesome xxxx
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the last part😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jay shetty ❤
LOOOL this sounds like twitter in a nutshell
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
um so i just unsubscribed
Irrelevant..
Remember when her videos were funny? Good old days..
THE FORBES REFERENCE AT THE END HAD ME SHOOK DIDNT EXPECT THAT COMING
EARLY SQUAD WHERE U AT
Ohhhh that Forbes list reference tho!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol... "You just mad you ain't on the list" 🤣🤣🤣 uh Forbes....
That Forbes reference OMG
Damage Control EveryBody.
THAT ENDING REFERENCE OMG HAHAHAAH I STAN
Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the quality of your videos have increased. I hope you come back well rested and ready for more :) Happy December.
Love what you did lily!! You included the Forbes drama!! That’s shadey
This video is to true
Loved it 🥰
THAT END WAS EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love it!!!
This reminds me of Shane Dawson's one last year
Jay Shetty! ❤❤❤
...whu-
Everything you do is the definition of hypocrisy.
Unsubbed
Did she just offend her own kind
I'm loving these videos, I don't know why they're not popular, maybe cause YouTube isn't promoting them??
correction: my mum is more woke than me
2:52 The Forbes list!!!
Love the end, you tell 'em girl!!!!!
I just loved the expression and smile of Jay shetty
Hahah so funny, the last bit was hilarious! <3
LEGENDARY!
“the LGBTQI+ community” ....yikes sjkdjsks
Jay's smile though😍
WHOA THAT FORBES REFERENCE AT THE END THO HAHAHHAH
i'm 100% woke but this video's hilarious
DAMN SHE SHADED SO BADDDDDD AT THE ENDDDDD
Hows your mental health break going?
The shade in the end tho...
Wooooow Superwoman and Jay Shetty's collaboration .This was cool
This is one of those videos where I have to click like before actually watching it because Lily and Jay Shetty!! Omg ahhjjeoendjwkwkshdjns xD
It's December.
OMG this is a genius video, "you just saying coz you're NOT ON THE LIST" that's a genius move lilly but ya when you evolve audience don't get it! artistry is appreciated by few, cheap hits reach larger numbers!
#JAY SHETTY
All of these are correct except the japanese/chinese one. People really need to learn the difference between things like that. I had to explain to my (older) brother that people from mexico are mexican, and people who are not from mexico and don't have mexican ancestry are not mexican.
And I thought llduncell couldn't be more annoying
Honestly... This reminds me of my colleague
Idk what’s happening but...ok
HAHA LAUGHED SO HARD!! THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER GUYS!!!!
yawns, i'm woke
Somewhere Matt Hardy is smiling looking at this video!
" getting offended is the biggeest trednd"
facts.
I was just talking about how people get offended over everything this year issa trendy😅
This was awesome....but I didn't understand it all because it was probably my first video from this channel and new Content ...
The last one 😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍👍
What an entry Jay😅
Imagine if they were a thing jay and lilly <3.<3 jilly
thats u
The dislikes proof that you can’t help this society anymore...
Lily Singh = spoiled npc
Hey guys, who here got the "You're just mad you're not on the list!" joke?
“She’s Chinese not Japanese”
“What’s the difference”
To me that’s like saying Americans and Canadians are the same.
I literally love this message where she told to use soya milk and stuff. If people stop using cow milk or animal tested products or global warming thing, animal abuse and environment will change a lot. I’m disappointed how people didn’t get it and bushing her.
Nice
I'm 19 and i ain't woke
This is the dumbest video ever , I just wasted 3 minutes 24 seconds of my life okay add another 30 seconds typing this .
okay honestly, I am obsessed with this collab. I LOVE IT SO MUCH! It's so cheesy and ridiculous and I couldn't even contain my laughter. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did! Shout outs to Rita Ora for being such a queen! Any guesses for Collab #5? Also... any suggestions for Collab #6? Not because I'm behind or anything. Asking for a friend... hehe.
“don’t want commitment baby i know your talk is cheap” mood this christmas 😂
”im punjabi, I’m albanian this isn’t our holiday“ im dead 💀
Lilly- i'm punjabi 
Rita- i'm Albanian 
Both- this ain't our holiday, 
But we like getting presents. So sure a king was born today. 

😂🤣🤣
I can't wrap is a bopppppp 😂😂😂👏👏👏👏
* 2:04


Thanks for the likes ❤❤❤
That rap is straight fire though... Here are the lyrics lol

Got a gift for my mama
No gift bag coz I wanna
Wrap it nice with some tape
But this ish a weird shape
Fold it once fold it twice
But this thing ain't looking right
Coz I can rap but I can't wrap
(Why's this gotta be so hard)
I can rap but I can't wrap
(Shoulda got a gift card)
I can rap but I can't wrap
(Now I'm heartbroken on Christmas)
I can rap but I can't wrap
(Maybe a bow can fix this)
Where can i get this Album? 😄
Aright who thinks they need a whole version of I can’t wrap
Ok here is the time stamp 2:05

Got a gift for my mama
No gift bag cause I wanna 
Wrap it nice with some tape
But this ish a weird shape
Fold it once fold it twice 
But this thing ain’t lookin right cause
I can rap but I can’t wrap
(Why this gotta be so hard)
I can rap but I can wrap
(Should a gotta gift card)
I can rap but I can wrap
(Now I am heartbroken on christmas)
I can rap but I can wrap
(Maybe a bow can fix this)

This collab and the James Charles one are my favorites so far
I love the intentionally bad editing 😂😂😂
MAN, Lilly's view rate is dropping so much. This makes me so sad. We gotta help her guys. She's not in her break anymore. Inform your friends thats she backkkk!
Okay so, I'm freaking out.

So my dads close cousin is a close cousin of Ritas. And Rita has touched Lilly, and her cousin obviously. And my dad has touched his cousin. AND I HAVE TOUCHED MY DAD. THIS MEANS I HAVE TOUCHED LILLY CALL ME CRAZY ALL YOU WANT BUT THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE

You should do a collab with Cardi B
I'm glad she took a break her videos are a lot more fun now.
Favourite parts 😂
"I'm Punjabi, I'm Albanian, this ain't our holiday."
"All I want for Christmas is a one-night stand."
"I can rap but I can't wrap."
who else actually called the number just for fun and some company picked up giving a survey and a chance to win a Caribbean cruise? Nobody, just me? Well this is awkward!😂, love your vids Lily!!
a collab I never knew I needed
OMG IMAGINE A SHAWN MENDES X LILLY COLLAB! Canadians unite! Maybe with camilla as well...;)
you should collab with nicki and gabi.

You should do a collab with Camila Cabello,  bcoz I think you guys are the same.  She is goofy you're goofy she is hilarious so are you.  You guys will vibe so good
This is by far my fave 😂😂😂 love the editing too
I actually tried calling..
RITA ORA!! I swear Lilly you outdo yourself everytime!
Can't believe people can hate on this lovely lady just because she took a short break and not a long one. I mean... 🙄
When Rita said "I'm Albanian" I felt so proud
The collab we all needed 😂
..After watching lilly for first time, it seems that she has got punjabi genes💕
I need this album 😂😂😂
So girl got rita ora now?
All I want for Christmas is a one night stay 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣

2:37 Kropotkin is that you?
THIS IS GREAT 
I NEED MORE
2:56 lmao the best thing ever
Where on EARTH Do I get this album?!!!!!
Lilly doesn't know how to play guitar!
okay but the beat for the “I Can’t Wrap” song needs to be used for an actual song bc it was fire🔥🔥
I love I can't wrap
Lily played like 50 instruments in this vid XD
i needed this collab XD lol
Did anyone else notice that it's Tina speaking in the beginning?
I can rap, but i can't wrap😂🎁
The rap part ugh😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
I watched this ELEVEN TIMES and I'm still OBSESSED loved it!
Ok ngl I Cant Wrap really slaps 👏🏾👏🏾
James Charles
Dr Phil
Try guys
And Rita Ora?! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS YEAR’S CHRISTMAS COLLABS ARE SOO DOPE!!!
i saw you on netflix lily in f the prom.
eggnog unclog has to be my favorite😂😂😂
Favorite one so far! 😂😂
Rita ora's vocals were so good but the rap part was absolutely dopeeeee😍
Why isn't 'I Can't Rap' a real song? It's soooo good. BTW here are the lyrics
Got a gift for my mama
No gift bag coz I wanna
Wrap it nice with some tape
But this ish a weird shape
Fold it once fold it twice
But this thing ain't looking right
COZ I CAN RAP BUT I CAN'T WRAP *4
Rita: WHY this gotta be so hard?
Should've got a gift card
Now I'm heart broken on Christmas
Maybe a bow can fix this
Wait..... can we buy the album??
Rita's voice tho😍
I need I can't Wrap on iTunes .❤❤❤❤
ok but like where can i buy this?? 😂😍
broke cookie party XD .... best AD
Do a collab with Jus Reign. A Punjabi Christmas album is just what I need 😂
Actually would listen to these songs if they were real lol
For the 1% of people who see this I hope you a bright and good future, I am a youtuber myself and  I’m not asking you to do anything but I would love to hit 20k by the end of the year!
THANK YOU, All OF YOUTUBE☃️❄️
Am I the only One who's Obsess with these Collabs
What a collab ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Rita Oras voice is bomb😍
Theere are fireworks coming out of my bum bum bum bummmm
Okay YouTube didn't notify me for this?? Anyway, I laughed so much XD I like the whole old/rusty theme with that seeminly-low quality <3
I love how they’re intentionally being unfunny 😂
This should actually be available 😂 love Rita 🙏🏻
Lilly laughing at the end made me crack and Rita Ora is awesome
I need a full version of I can't wrap
not here for the music but yo 2.48, thats kropotkin in one of the paintings
Im glad people are beginning to call her out on stuff. I wanna say more but she might make a roast video about me so. Yeah
#spreadonelove
I absolutely loved this! Thank you Lily and Rita!!
This is one of the weirdest things I’ve ever watched. I loved it
Omg the I cant wrap was amazingggg
The "I Can't Wrap" was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
But but you were taking a break??
this is amazing!! love it
2:33 “How do you spell Hanokah” 🤣
"I am albanian" BEST MOMENT OF THE ENTIRE VIDEO
Love the vintage editing style
Is it bad I want the album!😂
Loved "I can rap, but I can't wrap"
I can’t wrap was 🔥🔥
hilarious and...pretty honest, yes.
I can’t wrap is my favorite
all I have to say is this is AMAZING just made my day!!!
Ok... When you make fun of yourself then it's ok. But when you make fun of other then it's not. When she is being sarcastic about the things she her parents do as ' brown people' then it's ok. And when she says the same thing about you then it is not. I know the quality of her contents is not as  good as it use to be. But we are her YouTube family and I guess we should be supportive as we were when she was the star YouTuber.  What the shemurr!!!
ALL OF THESE VIDEOS ARE SO AMAZING
Ritas voice is so unique and amazingggg
I called the number. Best soundtrack ever <3
My all time favourite collab!!!!! 😂😍👏👏👏👏👏❤
5 star editing
I love I can't wrap
I love "I can't wrap"😂
Never listened to Rita Ora, going to listen to her all evening because of the All I Want For Christmas performance !
All i want for Christmas 2018 was my favorite hit😂
Lilly + rita 😍😍😍does it get any better !!!!!!!
YAY BEST COLLAB EVER I LOVE U AND RITA
I actually want to buy this
WHERE CAN I BUY THIS
i need a full album of this seriously
When Rita Ora sad that she is ALBANIAN l was so happy bc l am albanian too 😙😙😙😙😙😙😙😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
These iMovie edits tho😂
Rita 👐🏻 well done shqipe. U rock superwoman
Rita Ora 😍😍
Rita's voice is beautiful
This video was everything! My favourite song was the first one
Rita Ora:Fireworks came out of my 
Lilly:Bum bum bum bum
😂😂😂
No lie wish she made "I Can't Wrap" a full song and video lol
It makes me so happy to see lilly laughing! I love it!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Where can i buy the track? 🔥🔥🔥
Lilly + Rita Ora = Amazing
I ABSOLUTELY  LOVED THISSS MANNNN
i mean... i'm a christian and this is also not my holiday... jesus was actually born in may. hi capitalist holiday so good to have some vacation time, thanks 😂

"Maybe a bow can fix this" lol

Lilly, are you a ambassador of UNESCO?
Smh you had me sold until I saw the $4.99 shipping and handling

I called the number at 3:14 and it was a survey 😂 Lmao
You just had to make me look why 👌🏾
Me....and my thought process.
Rita Ora....Fifty Shades Trilogy.....For You....Liam Payne....LIAM PAYNE
This is literally me when in music class I'm partnered up with that one kid with the angelic voice and I have the shrill voice of cookie monster

😂😂😂 I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
BRO I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH
On "I can't wrap" I feel like Lilly sounds way better than rita
LILLY AMD THE KEYBOARD IM DEAD HAHAHA
I feel like noone is talking about egg nog song because it's too true and uncomfortably relatable and confronts our denial about drinking it knowing full well what it does to us.
Awesome collab with Camilla
This was priceless!
I CAN RAP BUT I CANT WRAP
the best Christmas song ever!
Your "mental health break" seems to be going great.

I usually don't comment under YouTube videos but this was amazing.
Great album, so  the one night is that for Christmas Eve  or Christmas Day.
All I want for Christmas is for people to stop laughing when I tell them "all I want for Christmas is you"
When you live under a rock and don’t know any of the people she’s collabing with.... 😂
This was really great. It felt different but I liked it.
I absolutely ADORE this video =)))))))))
No lie I wanted that album

Who else thinks the collab with James Charles is the best so far?
OMG Lilly this are so good. Your recent content before your brake did feel a bit to forced and I've stopped watching you for a while. Now obviously that you're posting video's they poped on my page so I've revised. They feel soo fresh, clever, funny and so well produced. I'm glad you're enjoying your work now and I can see that thru this videos.  GREAT WORK ♥️
I loved I can’t wrap.
Omggggggg I'm in love
This is great 😂

I got braces today and it really hurts.  Could anyone help in the comments?
For the 1% of people who see this I hope you a bright and good future, I am a youtuber myself and  I’m not asking you to do anything but I would love to hit 20k by the end of the year!
THANK YOU, All OF YOUTUBE
Honestly Rita Ora looks like a grandma😂😂😂
Where can I download????!!!!!
I cannot express how wonderful it was to collaborate with The Try Guys. They are absolutely LOVELY! I hope to do it 1000 more times tbh. Make sure you check out their channel because they're literally KILLING it on YouTube! And life. And in general. And check out the BTS video to see how we made the final product. Hope you have a great day and thanks for watching my #12CollabsOfChristmas! I appreciate you being here x Any guesses for Collab #4? xo
I love that Eugene was the ONLY guy that wasn’t roasted while they were singing.
Everyone's complaining about hate and it took me ages to find hate comments.
I keep finding comments complaining on hate and no actual hate comments


Edit no.1Thnx for all the likes.....but two more? ;)




Edit no.2 yaaaaay thnx I love you all!

Yes you!


Edit no.3 750?!?!?!?!!!!??!?!?!!?!!?! What how do people see this
What on earth is going on with the comments here. 

Lilly took some time for herself to improve her mental health. And some of yall are not satisfied because the break was not long enough? Is there some kind of competition among you people to see who is more broken?
OH MY GOD A COLLAB I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED
I DIED WHEN ZAC MADE OUT WITH THE PILLOW HAHA 😂😂
Just wanted to put my opinion out there...

1. If Lilly didn't take that long of a break then ok, whatever. She likes hustling.

2. Has anybody considered the fact that she might have recorded these videos after she said she was taking a break only so that she could take a real break during the holidays? (its called prerecording videos)
I'm scrolling down the comments and am disappointed to see hate when lily has obviously spent a lot time and effort making this for our entertainment personally I liked it and appreciate the effort put into this 👌👌💯
Why is she getting so much hate? I feel like after YouTubers take breaks everyone just hates them.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO STIP BEING SO MEAN
What is up with the comments on here? Half of you are saying it wasn't funny, a couple of you are saying she's gotten worse, a lot are saying she can't sing and so many of you are pointing out her mental health break and saying something was wrong with it!! Where is the positivity? Lilly works so hard- and I'm sure she appreciates constructive criticism, but so many of these are just hate comments! I for one thought this was funny! Not her best, but not bad enough to hate on. Leave the video if you don't like the singing.
There are comments complaining about hate comment when I can’t actually see any hate comments(nvm found them)
My bae sent me the link of this video🤣🤣
This is the collab to end all collabs.
Bloopers, we need bloopers!
Eugene is a actual queen when he's taking the photos 😂
"I love my wife so much" had me dying 😂😂😂
Don’t listen to them it was amazing
how does she do high quality videos EVERYDAY
The only thing more iconic than Lilly Singh is Lilly Singh with the Try Guys
End should’ve been: on the 12th day my true bae sent to me... a damn hot wedding ring. 
cue Keith and Ned’s wife
came to this video again because it was so hilarious, only to see you guys bashing Lilly that her break was "so short" or she didn't sound as good as the Try Guys.
 Seriously? Tbh guys that's a really petty thing to do, you might be the one needing some self reflection time instead.
Guys. Why would you pull her down after coming back from a break for a more positive outlook?
I hope you're doing okay with your mental health Lilly. I can tell that you had a lot of fun making this and that makes me happy. <3
There's an upsetting amount of negativity about a Christmas video so I want to post a positive comment and shine a torch in the tunnel of darkness.One love ❤️
I like the video !, I think its pretty funny and cool. Um also, please don't go hate me for my opinion, i know some of you hate the video, but please respect my opinion, thank you !.
I look at this different cause of the fact that Zach has A GF!!!!
I never thought that this collaboration would happen
lick my nose ring
Omg this is amazing....but now I can’t get that song out of my head, which is a good thing. I hope 😂😂😂
I love you LILY. This video was amazingly funny. So creative. Like all the other videos you make, so much thought went into it. Please ignore the haters that cloud the comment section. Don't allow their hate-filled sentences to cloud the love given to you by those of us who actually see your hard work shown in these videos. Keep up the good work, and be happy! Much love.
Right swipe on tinder?! Why? Arent you already dating?
THE WAY ZACK OPENED THAT BAG LMAO 2:05
Eugene is killing it with that hat
l love you llSuperwomanll
LILY YOUVE DONE IT AGAIN THIS IS GREAT
Woww
Ned on ASMR- I love my wife
Me- wtf another video with Ned talking about his wife...GREAT!!!!!!!
Everyone has their own opinions. Some may like the video, and some may not. So we should just be more respectful of each others opnions.  

I personally did not really find this very entertaining but that does not necessarily mean that i want to hate on lilly, i just wanted to comment on it so that she would be able to improve on her content in the future.
Order: 
Keith, Zach, Ned, Eugene, Lilly (first), Ned, Zach, Eugene Memoji (first), Eugene, Keith, Ned, everyone. 







That was intense.
Omg Superwoman and Try Guys. Epic colllab! Loving this video so much!!!!
I’m finding more complaints about the hate comments than the actual hate commets. Btw great collab
When Eugene showed up for the ASMR I thought he was going to whisper "Detective Pikachu" 🤣
Keith what are you doing you're married?!

lol.
OH MY GOD I CANT BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED!!! This is the greatest thing ever and OMG she is so lucky 
2:35 Eugene dies inside!!!
It sounds like Lilly can sing lower than all of them combined lol?
Maybe it's just autotune....
The perfect collab doesn’t exi-
Lilly uploads
For the first time in a long time... Lilly cracked me up!! 😂😂😂😂😂
You can tell this is millennials and not gen z cause it’s too optimistic
🙌 Yes! Yes! The collab we never knew we needed! Love you, Lilly!
OMG THANK U SO MUCH FOR THIS LILY I FOUND THE TRY GUYS FROM THIS VIDEO AND NOW IM BASICALLY IN LOVE!!
OMG THE BIGGEST COLLAB OF THE CENTURY IM SCREAMING
"sext whilst I'm working" 😭😭😭😭
I want you to lick my nose ring - Lilly 2018
0:41, you know it’s good when Ned makes that face... 😂😂😂
You made me enjoy Christmas carols again 😭😂👌
your favorite youtubers doing a collab is amazing
It's the end of 2018 and people can't take a break from saying that hate speech and criticism is the same thing. Also, also, comment freely but remember that these YouTubers, are as human as you are. They are trying to be better and when they fail, doesn't mean you have to drag it as far as you can around the globe. Sometimes what we are lacking is just the capability to remember that these people are human, h u m a n. Just like us, just like your siblings, parents, family, friends or even your enemies. 

Cheer up, smile or something, we're close to the end of the year and to a brand new start. We're getting nowhere if we think that this is the right thing to do to basically anyone. 

P.s When someone has a huge aspiration, doesn't mean they want to stop being treated like a human.
I see try guys and Lily, I click
My two favourite youtube channels and Youtubers were together. This was the best thing in the entire 2018.....
ROMANTIC ASMR
KEITH MESSED UP LIKE 50 TIMES BAHAHAHA
This was so funny
But the password to their phone LOL
Keith and Lilly are so cute cuddling
Hey random person scrolling down the comments.. 

Have an excellent day :)
Yessss! 
This is AMAZING! 😂💕
I’m dying 😭
I love you Lils and the Try Guys 💕😊
Gorgeous amazing 10/10 would listen to again
Collab with Tom Holland :))
LMAO!!! LOVEEE this!!!
My dream come true. Loved it Lilly ❤️❤️
Who the eff needs this many Netflix passwords?
You nailed it!😂❤
NED'S FACE EVERYTIME THE SEXT ONE COMES OUT GETS ME EVERY TIME 😂😂
Funny Lilly + Funny Try Guys = best Christmas-themed video ever in 2018!
Try guy game time (like if u get it)
Yassssss God has blessed me with this wonderful video
The best collab ever!!!!
Lilly, I love you sm, this was such a funny video. I saw most of the hate comments, PLEASE ignore them.
All the love❤❤
Ned dabbing is one of the most sinister things I've seen all year
Yo i didnt know people could be this mean damn, keep doing what you're doing Lilly.... you need that time off that you promised yourself and come back being the best you with the best content you've ever created. 12 collabs of Christmas isn't what you need right now but since you've already started, you might as well finish and come back better in the new year. I don't know what else to say other than just re-evaluate why you chose Youtube instead of Psychology and come back in touch with all that potential/hope/creativity that you had at the beginning. A lot of people get blinded by the numbers and drive themselves far away from the purpose and reason they started their channel in the first place.
Please collab with safiya nygrad & Christine (simply nailogical) ! Please
Best collab! And i was so reluctant to watch it but it's... like... THE BOMB!
An epic collab I never knew I needed 😂
THIS MUST BE THE BEST HOLIDAY SONG THERE IS!
Im officially DEAD thanks to a Christmas Carol (and of course Eugene)
Me: SEXT WHILE IM WORKING 
mom walks in 
🙏🏽pray for me🙏🏽
Can we just take a moment to notice how Eugene never broke character!!?!
The edits of the try guys when their singing gets me so hard every time 😂
Is it just me who loved Eugene's jump at 3:25?!! Whoever came up with the idea of this collab is pure genius! 
One love superwoman!!!! 😘😘😘
give me your toenails

Me:best pickup line honestly.
I want you to sniff my hair - Lilly 2018
deep breath
Keith: I love your shirt
Also Keith: give me your shirt
LOVE THIS VID 
What was your favorite day?
There's honestly so much negativity in the comment section. FYI, there's a difference between constructive criticism and just being flat out rude and/or mean. So you don't like the video, fine. But don't go on a rant about how awful her content is or how she's not working hard enough. You obviously don't know how much work goes into making a YouTube video. She worked really hard on this and for you to say otherwise. Also, not all of her videos are meant to be funny per se. I didn't laugh, but this video made me smile. I thought it was a fun video idea for the holidays. Lily, if you see this, I'm sorry so much hate is being thrown your way. I wish you the best on the rest of the year, and may 2019 bring you much more happiness :)
I’ve been waiting for this collab forever SOOOOO HAPPY
The collab I secretly needed but never knew 🤗 this is amazing
I just love how they make fun of ASMR 😅
I remember when you were still a small youtuber, and youre videos were always my safe space when i was upset.  Now youre on huge television shows, movies, and youre about to reach 15 million subs. i feel so proud of you, but i'd be lying if i said i dont miss when you were that secret place that id go to in seek of comfort. i love you sooo much <3
I can only imagine how much effort and time went into this. Thank you Lilly, Keith, Ned, Zach, and Eugene! I really enjoyed this.
THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOO AMAAAZZINNNGGGGG!!!! 😂😂😂😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️🎄🎄🎄
I saw all the comments complaining about the hate before I saw the comments with the hate
Did anybody else notice the “lmao”s and the “lolololol”s 😂
Wait a minute. . . 







Zack’s sweater has a dog on it
Probably the best video I’ve seen from you......mainly because of the Try Guys.
Ned looks like such a Dad, I love it.
I'm sure she already had these videos ready to go before she took a break since they are collabs.  I'm sure she is still taking time off and having a break, but why not put out content already made for the holidays.  This was a great video.  Just being silly and a bit off script.  
No wonder she took a break, though!  These comments are so mean, and just rude.  Its supposed to be the happiest time of the year and some of you are just miserable human beings.  

Lily, You do you girl.   I love you and support you :)
Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than it already is, THE TRY GUYS ARE HERE !!!!!
the bestttt!! both of my fav..Lilly with Try guys ❤😂 #HappyHolidays and #MerryChirstmas
best 




collab




ever
I cannot STOP WATCHING
I was scrolling through the playlist nd almost choked..
Keith was so goddamn animated during this lmao
..."And A Netflix password for my t.v.!"😂😂
So this is how my brain feels 24/7

This was perfect!!! I didn’t know I needed this until today.
OMG A COLLAB I NEVER KNEW I NEEEEEDDDDDEEEEDDDDDDDD❕❕❕

I love the try guys being solo, being able to be with more youtubers doing awesome things.
Omg yass I've been begging for this collab
Yes my fav youtubers of all time in one video thank you❤❤❤❤❤
I have been waiting for this for my whole flipping live ahhhhhhhhhhh🥰❤️💋🤣🤣🤣😱
Isn't it iconic that her bae sent her the password to his phone which  was 6969?
Honestly one of the funniest videos I’ve seen in a long long time I had to backtrack so many times to watch again 😭😭😭
This was funny Lilly and I’m sorry you’ve been getting so much hate. 





Ps. You doin great boo, you do you (and yes I did incorrect grammar on purpose)
Wait! Lilly finally did a collab with the try guys
 This video made me so happy
Superwoman AND The Try Guys! YASSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
You should be concerned if your bae still has tinder 😂
GOOD JOB LILLY IGNORE THE HATERS KEEP IT UP!!!
😂😂😂😂😂 I LOVE THISS
Eugene is always so perfect😂💕
OMG A COLLABORATION OF MY TWO FAVORITE YOUTUBE CHANNELS,🤣🤩😍
AHHH BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO SINCE FOREVER FINALLLYYY!!
Lilly, honey don't even think about the negative comments.
#TeamSuper loves you for who you are and not if you magically came back from a break for your mental health issue.
What I'm saying is, Be positive and look at all positive comments.
I loved the video a lot.😊😊😊😚😚😚😍😍😙😙❤❤❤
Ahh! I love this! 💖
Absolutely hilarious😂😂😂
iisuperwomanii + try guys = UNSTOPPABLE

sTOP
*tHE *
HATE

When Eugene jumped and swung his arm back when he was taking pictures of Lilly... A MOOD
"I love your shirt"😂😂😂😂
I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE SO BAD
Been watching you for about 4 years now. You still surprise me all the time . Thank you Soo much for working so hard just to bring a smile on our faces . You are a God.
I just realized that you met the try guys...FFFFFFFUUUUUCCCCCC
This was awesome!




Except the dab... Smh 🤦‍♂️
THIS WAS THE BEST COLLAB
My 2 favourite YouTube channels!!!!!
Thank you Lilly for such a phenomenal video with the Try Guys, though I’m not subscribed to them nor a fan of their content, nonetheless, they are outstanding comedians and collaborated with you in an exceptional manner, for that much respeckkk
Best collaboration ever!
I've watched this so much. Loved this collab. Sweetest
@ this people complaining about how she wasn’t away for long.

This is not how you treat people with mental health issues. Why does it matter if she was gone a week or two?

Is it not better if she’s back sooner as apposed to isolating herself.

Get a grip people.
Lilly u can make unicorn pull the Santa cart in the intro that would be so intelligent and dope
Fricken normies bro. What the heck.
I love this! 😂❤️
Ned: whispers I love my wife so much


I’m deceased
I've been waiting for this forever
THIS COLLAB IS DA BEST OKMGGGMMGMGMGM
Zach has so many favorite foods delivery!!!!😂🤣🤣
Ok this is perfect! My two favorite YouTube channels come together! Eeeeeeee!
The romantic asmr is giving me life. 😂
Ned dabbing at the end!!! Love all of you guys!!
‘‘Tis the season 🎄✨
YES MY TWO FAVOURITE YOUTUBERS THIS NEEDED TO HAPPEN
This was the best thing ever! Best collab ever!
13k people got lost on their way to the like button
This ended up so amazing! :D
Omg the iconicness jumped out
so much hard work was put into this
Lol yes only a true Bae would do these things
Create a parent's reaction for a blackpink video 😭😭
This has me wheezing 😂😂😂😂 great video !!
YES THIS IS THE BEST COLLAB EVER
AND A NETFLIX PASSWORD FOR MY TV
Luv u sooooo girl !!
This was SO good!!!!
YAS I NEEDED THIS!!  AMAZING
Sounds about right for the millennial edition
I didn't skip the ad. Hope Lilly makes it next year on Forbes List ❤️❤️
I wonder what my bae sent me.... oh wait I don’t have one.

*so very single*
This is extremely unfunny

Also I thought lily was taking a break from YouTube?
I can’t report all of the negative comments



Don’t listen to all the haters lilly❤️ you are funny, beautiful and amazing💙
OMG I AM PERFECTLY HAPPY
Am I the only one questioning where 2. Is???
like this comment if you’re questioning too .
Btw I don’t watch Lilly’s videos that much so if there is 2. Please comment where I can find it
Eugene’s so 🔥❤️
Love this ❤️😂💞🤣
this is my new favourite video
Best video ever. Love them and you so much.
Great video acc so creative glad ur back Lilly x
This was really nice Lily. The lyrics are stuck in my head now 4 some reason😂😂😂 .(Also, my mom's name is Lily)
OMG I love the try guys and I love you Lilly your book change my life
This was very creative. I wouldn't have come up with those words but #onlysuperwomancan. I love you ❤





Oh and the people who have negative comments, please "Sit down and Be humble"
All the haters are from drama alert. Team Super knows the truth.
I think lilly is trying to return to where she started on youtube in the past by posting music videos. This is a new begining. 
The only problem this video has is about mixing the voices otherwise it’s perfect.
😂😂 this is awesome ❤
honestly this made my day
Someone dm ME a Netflix pass fur real 😫
I MY GODDDDDDDD
THIS IS ALL I'VE WANTED MY ENTIRE LIFEEEEEE
0:22 
when ur best friend comes over

2:57 when you're at your friend's house.
This was uploaded on my birthday (10th December). I’m honoured, but it’s also now
April.
Favorite food delivery!! 🤣
Ned's ASMR (obviously): I love my wife so much
lovely concept BUT THE SINGING HUST HURTS
Doctor: You have 3 mins and 52 seconds to live. 
Me:
I want you to sniff my hair

sorry i just found that so funny 😂
Those asmr whispers got me😂😂
Omg I loved this👻
OMG! OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG! 😍😍😲😲😲😍😍😍

MY SKIN IS CLEAR, MY GRADES ARE UP, MY DEPRESSION IS CURED, AND MY CROPS ARE WATERED.😲😲😍😍SISTER SHOOK!!!!!!
Ahhh the try guys and Lily this is everything 🙌
COLLAB WITH CONNOR FRANTA!!!
This was honestly my favorite thing
Im here for my guys especially  Eugnen 💓
Lili, i love you, but next time maybe try to blend your voice with the rest of the guys
I’m really looking forward to your post-break videos cuz hopefully it’ll be more of Lilly Singh OG & not whatever this is 😭😭😭. Love you but this - nope.
She let her Canadian roots show by spelling favorite as favourite
omg that's brilliant
WHATS THIS? BOTH OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS??!??!? IN ONE VIDEO????????? HUF UFRNHNFIRFNIJRFNIJRFNFRJNFNJFRNFFIRHNRFFJIFRF

Bro I can’t I love thisss 🤣
Eugene didn't made a single mistake 
He's perfect!!
Imagine being this out of touch
Who needs 12 netflix passwords?
THAT WAS SO GOOD😂😂😂😂
Loved this collab the try guys are amazing. Bit bummed that you couldn't really hear their voices but still a really great video idea
I heard if you write a youtuber's real name 5 times and their first name once in emojis they'll pin your comment.

Let's try!!!

1. IISuperwomanII

Lol the third day... That's exactly how I look when I'm chatting with the RFA.
Theory: The time that Lilly took off was to become an even badder bawse with bigger collabs than ever...All I want for Christmas is Superwoman to make me laugh, and I know she will for sure. 😘❤️
Best collab
I need more of this
This is a dream come true all my most favorite people in one video TOGETHER im gonna go scream into a piklow now bye
Sat Sri Akal Lilly!  Im a mom of 3 college age kids and your videos have been both stress relieving and extremely mind-expanding.  I am myself penning the pearls of my experience to help kids and their parents joyfully meander the minefields of growing up.  I have come to care for your well-being deeply and have prayed for your inner dissonance to resolve.  I do advise one point as I have always told my own kids.....your happiness finds you only if you embrace the natural proclivities of your inner desires.  Many times, we try to convert the fuel of what we really want into something else...thinking that we mark our independence and growth through this conversion.  But we end up creating a denial inside ourselves that grows the void which would have been filled simply by following our heart.  You can still accomplish all that you want and Waheguru jee will 100 percent give you all that your soul needs because of the pure and beautiful soul that you are....but don't continue to deny what you need...even if it doesn't fit some self-image you feel you must uphold...lots of love and warmth
It was cute the first 10 times 😂 (no hate tho 💕)
40 on trending
Best collab yet!
I couldn’t finish watching the video it was that bad I thought is had to at least good because the try guys are in it but I was so wrong🤦‍♀️
It’s good that she’s enjoying her break from YouTube ❤️
This is being removed from my watch history
This ain't it Chief
Omg I love the try guys
I died of awesome
cannot wait for the next 11 days xD
Goddammit that must've been exhausting lmao
MY.



DREAM



COLAB HAS HAPPENED !!!!!!
give me your shirt
THE COLLAB I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
so happy your back boo take all the time you need
The collab we didn’t know we needed untill today
Password to the phone, now i have seen the purest form of love
Ned be looking like Mitchell Pritchett from Modern Family 😂
My favorite food delivery.... that prefect
I hit like immediately because iam a huge try guys fan and I appreciate the idea...but they really could've worked on their singing a lot more - including Lilly- ..it felt so wrong the moment I heard it DX
Iam not sure what was exactly wrong though since iam not an expert 
Too bad 😐
Instantly smashed the like button for the Try Guys 👌
I believe it’s “the twelve days of litmas”
WTF WHY IM THIS LATE????
🤣😂🤣 I hate this song so much, but I suffered through it because I knew it would be worth it.
OMG ROMANTIC ASMR IS LITERALLY SOOOO FUNNY!!!!
Quite good singing, but it was super low for her, that´s why it didn´t sound right in the lowest parts.  Btw, love you, Try guys!!
Loved the video idea, the ASMR-part was super funny and The Try Guys are amazing, but I reeally didn't loved how Lilly's voice was so prominent, even though it sounded kind of hoarse ☹️. I hope this doesn't come off as hate, just feedback-wise I thought maybe there could have been more focus on the vocals.
Oh my God I was so surprised when I saw this I mean I never expected this . Just pure awesomeness 😃👍
This is ICONIC
“I’ll see you soon” but was only gone for a month 🤦🏾‍♂️
Netflix password for my tv
Wow what a iconic video
Wow this is soooooo funny and relateable this is the epitome of comedy
I enjoyed this vid, dont listen to the haters
I thought she was taking a break...?
Of course Ned has to mention his wife 😂💕
Omg u should a 'parents react to arian grande's new video 'thank u,next' 
That would be so amazing!
That was so good!!!
2:38 uhh i dont know what to say
Don’t know if it was funny but it sure is creative ... great job lily singh
It should be Tru not true
1:48 thank you😭😂
3:20 mmmm k
I want to know if there’s a playlist for the 12 collabs of Christmas videos
this was so wholesome x
im procrastinating from doing my homework, worth it





imma play it again now... trigonometry is worthless anyways...
Also a collab that I thought that would never excise
i dont even know the lyrics of the original HAHAHAAHA
Who made the lyrics? An NPC???
An absolute work of art
"i love my wife so much"
That gasp!!! He's out o breath Lily!!!!
2:41
Oh
1:58 Keith’s Face, LOL
AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I LOVE THIS!!!! :-D
I LOVE LILY'S VOICE SO MUCH 💖
Gen z but close enough
Omg I love this!!!!
😂 love the texts I wonder if they noticed
Ned is crying after this because he feels guilty for his wife
Nah I would rather have the old one. Like I would have 40 gold rings than romantic asmr
2:40 OOOO IM TELLING BECK LMAO😂😂😂
You look like you are having so much fun in these videos.  Keep them coming.  :)
s u c k   m y   t o e n a i l s
2 weeks late but no one cares LOLLL
N I P P L E     P L A Y
Can we talk about how cute Zach’s Memoji is?
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE??
ATTENTION EVERYBODY
I have found.... THE MEANING OF LIFE!!
How do yall go onto day 2 and 3 have only 1 of that thing buyt day 4 you got 4 photos, and then go back to a single thing after day 5

Its like you either know the song or you dont wtf
3:05 so you only have to hear it once
I finally know it!!
OMG had to share this hahahahahahaaa
that was the best thing i saw today
I LOVED THIS <3
I appreciate the try, but this ain’t it chief
Why don’t they teach this carol in school instead.
Zach’s Memoji looks like Harry Potter lol.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHHA I NEVER EVER THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD COLLAB WITH THEM
I clicked so fast
Wait I’m not the only one that thought this was honestly AMAZING
This video is so entertaining I keep coming back
Thinks I am late but am early 
drops phone
Love this 💖🙈😂
Is Eugene single?😄
The colander i didn’t know I needed in my life
And you wonder why you weren't on forbes list this year... smh
I love this so much 😂😂
Ned's fawning over the sext was the best part, it just got better and better xD love when my favs collab
I WANT YOU TO SNIFF MA HAIR LMAO
this is the cutest thing <3
People, she stopped vlogging, all of these videos have been worked on weeks maybe even months before being uploaded
Omgg omg omg omg omg omg. More collabss with TTG plss
AHHAAHAH love those boyss <3
LADYLIKE NEXT PLEASE
2:47 wait that’s my password
Love how Eugene’s just sexily starting directly at the camera the whole time during the outro 😂
I can't relate to any of this. Does that mean I'm not a millennial or that I'm not a YouTuber from California?
Honestly the only reason I didn't like this is cause it didn't have the countdown of items. It just felt wrong especially since you did include it at some parts like four pics of my outfit. It just felt like there were times were it could've easily be worked in like day 2 being a double tap on insta, or 3 sexts at work. I did like how original it was with modern twists like bae instead of true love and replacing the classic gifts of love with there modern equivalent.
S u c k m y t o e n a i l s
Omg so hilarious I loved it !!!
i love how every time they go back it just gets more intense lol
Dude look up what Bae means in danish
This collab is too much 😂😂😂
She seems so.much happier and I am so happy for her
OH. MY GOD.
Things I want from my true bae on the 12 days of Christmas
My brother walked in said “WTF?!?!” Than closed the door and walked out! 😂😂
Needless to say but we all know that sext was from Ariel 😂😂
Love this lol
best version of this song ever
Omg 3:23 😂
this is DOPE !!! :D :D
The password for Ned’s phone was 6969...
Doesn't really roll off the tongue the same way
It’s amazing
Lol love this. Keith blocking his exes made me literally lol. I wish it was #2 so I could see it more often
This was hilarious lmao
Just utter unbearable music I'm gonna go watch some Mr brightside
I’m lowkey waiting for Shane Dawson to appear-
Nice. Haters must back off.
clicks for try guys and only for try guys

never hears try guys throughout entire video
Does not apply to this single dude😏
On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me three French hens....
Ned’s face during sext while i’m working😂
now this, is pure perfection.
this was a good concept that was just executed poorly.
THIS IS THE BEST DAMN VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!!!💥💥❤❤❤
2:56 when my mom asks me to give me my shirt to wash while I’m wearing it
Y'all need Jesus
Wow, this just cured all my mental illnesses. I can definitely see how this helped you.
Who else noticed the phone password?😂
my dear lilly you have got your self a new subscriber :]
...no avocado toast?! No complaints  about working hard?! No lack of common sense?! Not my millennials! 🍞🥑
You want to be in the Top 10 YouTubers, work harder. Also, Maybe don't go so full SJW. There's a reason why Conservatives dominate YouTube. Just saying.
Well ... About as useful as the traditional gifts.  So well played Millenials!
killing it with these collabs Lilly !
People can't decide if they like her video or not without watching it first. So saying "if you don't like her don't watch it" is invalid argument. 

The video was okay even with the Try Guys and did not exceed my expectations. Totally Unfunny.
That was so random 😂
this song literally grew on me. i was like not feelin it and by the end i couldn't stop smiling. excellent job playing with the repetition
I love Lily Singh so much she is a real cutie
This IS GOLD
Hi lilly :)
MY COLLAB DREAM CAME TRUE!!!!
Love you 😘
I need this on Apple Music
Your ring cost 80 bucks
2:40 andpassword is 6969
Lmao Lilly's voice stands out so much when they're singing
2:23 HOW ICONIC
If this won't become the new Christmas anthem, I don't know what will. Goodbye "All I want Christmas", hello "12 days of Christmas - millennial edition"
This is like a dream come true! ❤️
that is comedy.....politically correct version
Omg QUEEEEEEEN ignore he hate comments you’re amazing! This collab was literally all I could ask for 😁
omg ned mentioned his wife!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I"MMMMMMM DYINGGGGGGGGGGGGG
I'M DEAD LOLL
yes yes yes
Is it really cringy and annoying or do I just not get it?
How many Netflix password do you need?
This time you should really take a break
Just watch it starting at 3:06, you're welcome.
I love Lilly n I've watched every single video of her's......but I didnt quite find this one funny    at all
YES THE TRY GUYS
I never knew i needed this until i was it. WHERE HAS THIS COLABB BEEN ALL MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!
Love it!!!! Wonderful!!!!! Merry Christmas
But I'm not laughing....
My ears are bleeding
That made no sense but was sooooooo cooooool 😂😂😂😂
Great video! 5 of my favourite youtubers together! <3
can't stop watching it because of Ned!! <3 <3 <3 <3

This was awesome 💓
I bet no one watched the whole thing and clicked out the video a minute in
I personally don't understand the Hate.
OKUUURRR THAT WAS THE BEST CHRISTMAS SONG EVERRR
THE TRY GUYS!!!!!
Relatable
Ingredients:
1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 1/2 cups granulated sugar, divided
4 extra-large eggs, at room temperature
1/3 cup grated lemon zest (6 to 8 large lemons)
3 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, divided
3/4 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
For the glaze:
2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
3 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Instructions:
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour 2 (8 1/2 by 4 1/4 by 2 1/2-inch) loaf pans. You may also line the bottom with parchment paper, if desired.
Step 2: Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and the lemon zest.
Step 3: Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.
Step 4: Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves. When the cakes are done, allow to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and set them on a rack set over a tray or sheet pan; spoon the lemon syrup over them. Allow the cakes to cool completely.
Step 5:For the glaze, combine the confectioners' sugar and the lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth. Pour over the tops of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides

. The people on the internet are no longer fun. 




Lilly, I love you
Is it just me or is anybody hungry for avocado toast after watching this video?
Man, that break for your mental health was very long
Some of my favourite youtubers working together💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 I’m so happy you worked with the try guys!
Why are you making a video about Christmas after bashing Christians?
How did I get here? No, seriously, wtf even is this?
Hello random person going through the comments.

I honestly really like your voice, it's like really unique and pretty
I just love you guysss
IS KEITH CHEATING ON BECKY

For as many people reacting with thumbs, there sure are a lot more negative comments than positive. You're very misleading sometimes, people.
I think I might have permanently broken my finger while clicking on this notification so hard

I remembered the memory games I used to lose in school days....😂
💖💖💖💖💖💖
Happy Christmas Superwoman....in advance...🎄
4 weeks ago she announced she was taking a break. Releasing all these videos this week, doesn’t add up. How long was her break? A couple of days? O.o
End should've been: on the 12th day my true bae sent to me... a damn hot wedding ring.
cue Keith and Ned's wife
AMAZING
To all the hate comments, no one asked you tho
Gosh I was so confused in the end when she said BTS of the video...
Four queens in the same video
Who is here before a million views?
Smosh did it better about 10 years ago... and a copy of my favorite movie!
This made my day....LILLY IS A QUEENNNN
Ned was the funniest in this! In the uber hahaha

This was so cute and funny!!! :D
This ain’t it
Oh God, please stop!
Becarefull Try Guys, she'll get jealous when you are more famous than her. And complained why she didnt make money as much as you guys.
I'm guessing you're going to collab on The Try Guys channel after this too?
the try guys 😍😍😍
🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE THIS IVE BEEN BINGING TRY GUYS SINCE WATCHING THIS
At the beginning, I didn't have any idea, what I got into. At the end, I still don't know.

If you focus on each try guy, you can hear their voice louder than the others. Especially Zach.
Googles "How to sound hip" before writing this script
I know them
Daniel T Gaming sent me here
For those saying she was taking a break she probably filmed some videos before the break
Becky be coming for you....

Both of my favorite youtubers??? 


Lilly Singh



The Try Guys??



Wow, this is really gonna be a merry Christmas to me!!❤❤
6969 I see what you did there 😂
I'm a millennial... except I'm not.
am i the only one who only hears lilly’s singing the most & just distant bg voices from the guys :’
Anyone knew that the password to the phone is 6969
Awesome!! I did a collaboration with myself and made my own Christmas song video! 🎄 🎅 🎤
Should have practiced more since the flaws we're easy to spot. Also pointing them out made the video just weird
The only good thing about Christmas is the slew of superwoman collabs.
Here for the try guys
YASSS
2:38 ???????
I don’t understand the humor 
This is just as annoying as millenials are
😱 how in the world can i miss this 😑
I sang this in the classroom with my teacher discussing and when I shouted "A sext while I'm working" They looked at me weird and disgusted. Lol 😂
YAASSSS
U can only hear lily
I don’t understand why people hate this so much?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Try guys with superwoman!! Christmas came early :)
Hah😂😂😂😂 lolololol
Amazing
Uh...
Your dead
CAN I JUST SAY THAT DR. PHIL IS ONE OF THE COOLEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER COLLABED WITH?! like real talk. So nice. So down to earth. An icon. Hope you enjoyed it! Who do you think collab #3 is with?! #12CollabsOfChristmas
“You know what the problem is Mr. Phil?”
“Dr. Phil”
“Are you a medical doctor?”
“psychologist”
“Okay, you know what the problem is Mr. Phil?”
LOVE THIS
it hurts to see manjeet with lilys voice
Hmmm let me see 
1. Messed up child
2. Horrible parents 
3. Parents arguing a lot 
4. Kid becomes famous 
5. Some 3rd degree burns given by non other than dr. Phil himself 
Yep! Sounds like a normal dr. Phil episode to me!!!
I loved this video! I actually thought it was hilarious that Dr. Phil looked past the characters and started talking straight to her😂 it was a good twist
Okay but can we just talk about how perfect the overlapping is in the beginning?
You honestly would think those are 3 people sitting there, instead of Lilly playing 2 diff people at diff times!
Always amazed by Lilly! <3
do a collab with Ellen next
Wow. The comment section has become very negative. Whats going on? Why are people being so rude?
Love the 4th-dimensional breaking moment & the camera on the camera crew lolol!!!
It’s true this isn’t as funny as her usual videos but it dropped a plot twist bomb that made it quite intriguing, I just wish it was longer.
Omg so far this is the BEST 12 days of collabs ever!!! Omg first sister James now dr phill this is great! 😁😁 🎄
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT

I THOUGHT THIS WAS A JOKE
Nice one Dr. Phil!
Yo! I'm Really Feeling these new videos for this year! She really came back harder than ever! I see you Lilly! Keep doing you boo!
How does one get Dr. Phil to do a collab
What's with all the hate? I freakin loved this video!
Manjeet: you know what the problem is mr.phil
Dr.phil: its Dr.Phil
Manjeet: you a doctor
Dr.Phil: psychologist
Manjeet: hmm.. you know what the problem is mr.phil

Manjeet is the best😂😂
Dr.Phill's attempt at Lilly 's sign out thing was priceless
Never cringed so much in my life
"Break from YouTube..."
Collabs getting bigger and bigger every year
1. James Charles
2. Dr. Phil
3. Who's Next???
wow this is almost Lele Pons "funny"
I can not look at Manjeet and Paramjeet as Lilly, ever!

Edit: Can't wait for my YouTube videos to be as good as Lilly's 😌
Pls collab with Ellen 💜
Yo wtf this comment section it has so much negative energy why do y'all consist on leaving negative comments if you don't like the video like just leave instead of bringing down someone y'all mf really got issues
“u know what the problem is Mr. Phil”
“Dr. Phil”
“r u a medical doctor?”
“Pshycologist”
“ok u know what the problem is Dr. Phil?” 
LOVEEEE THISSSS
WHY WAS IT TOUGH HUH I GAVE U BLOODY EVERYTHING! 😂😂😂
Lilly's voice coming out of Manjeet is so unsettling....
Thank you for this subtle confession
It is very strange hearing Lily’s voice from Mangeet.
"Why you agreed to arrange marriage if you are not going to except stranger for who they are."
hahahh
1:06
I loved it!!!!! Especially the end! 😂😂💕💕💕💕🙌 Don't pay attention to the hate Lilly! Haters gonna hate.
Players gonna play.
Live a life man.😂
HAHA XD SAVAGE OMG SO FUNNY LOLZ R4WR!!!
"You know what problem is Mr. Phil?"
"Dr. Phil."
"Are you medical doctor?"
"Psychologist"
"Ya Okay. You know what problem is Mr. Phil cuz you always bloody putting me down!" 

Btw I am a British Indian and I find this too funny!!
1:17 no...no no no no no no! THIS CAN'T BE TRUE. 








THE ULTIMATE TRUTH HAS BEEN REVEALED 😭

Hats off to Lilly
Bow down to the bawse queen

Lilly = I just want my parents to listen 
Her mom = uh what did she said

1/2 the comments: Lilly is irrelevant, blah blah forbes

Other half: this isn't funny blah blah

Me: you think she can collab with Steve Harvey next?
WHERE DID THE FOURTH WALL GO!
Amazing Lilly 👏🏻👍🏻
Omg I swear I saw these 2 characters in a video about 6 years ago , they haven’t aged well still doing the same exact thing except Phillis proscribing pillis was in this one
This is as funny as lele pons videos tbh
1:17 Dr Phil asking the real questions
This. Is. Exactly. What. It. Would. Be. Like. 😂 😂
Manjeeth : "Dance like prabu dava"

Me: chokes on water
OMG you’re actually doing  YouTube I’m so excited
Make a part 2!!!!! I wish this was longerrrrrrrrrrrr
Cash me outside has entered the chat.
This. Is. Spectacular. 

The most unexpected collab, the best though.

Me is confusion, someone please correct me or explain😂
I think that it is soo funny how people can comment  that watching this video was a waste, when they are the ones wasting their time making hateful comments to put someone down.

Lily keep doing what you do, because you make me laugh. And from here you can only grow and get better
*NO.. WAY... I MEAN... WWOOOOOOWWW
SLAY DR. PHIL! SLAY!
Dr Phil out hear looking lik a snack
she’s deleting comments

All the brown people up in here (including me)  are praising Lilly for that Prabhu Deva  reference like YASSSSSSSSSSS!!!
" Why do you agree to an arranged marriage if you're not going to accept strangers for who they are " xD

Viewers..  Ohh lily is cringy.. Ohh its not working..how come she did all the collabs wen she took a break..Blah blah... 
May these collabs made her exhausted in the first place
This was so good.. love the borderline dark humour.. so bold!

OMG THANKS FOR ALL THE LIKES I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS MUCH 😝😂🤣

Prabu deva fans?
Who else likes the video before watching because they it's going to be amazing ♥️
I really didn't find this funny but I'm glad Dr. Phil called her out
I DIDNT THINK YOU COULD TOP COLLABBING WITH KARLIE KLOSS
Lol Dr.Phil smiling at the end kinda creeped me out bc he never usually smiles😂😂
SEND HER TO THE RANCH
Promote what you love don't bash what you hate

Omg I haven't seen dr.phil like this lol.
Let's go 2 one trending in a row
Now everyone is questioning why Lilly dresses up as the parents
Omg doctor Phil??? How on earth did that happen?? Two legends in one video
Dr. Phil gets triggered in the end
You should stop this multipersonality BS
Indian talk call center people speak better then this lady🤣
Where does Dr. Phil hide all these make up wipes?
You are so undeserving of the spotlight
Brooooo wtf I can relate to this so much
Omg I live THISS💛❤

Loved this!💜💜😂
HAHAHA LILLY YOU ARE THE BEST OMG
This was so hilarious! Cant wait to whom you will collab with next!
Here she is at last! The Lily I love so much😍😍!
"Why you going to agree to arranged marriage if you're not going to accept stranger for who they are?"
Gold.
Mr Phil took me out 😂😂😂
who gave u permission to make the perfect video on youtube excuse me
I can't believe she did a collab with  Dr Phil
Dr Phil is not a doctor or even a phycologists he has no degrees he is just an actor in the 80s he would come on TV shows and low budget movies
Yo this was mad funny cause I think Lily really does this in almost all her political/controversial skits 😂😂😂 earned a like from me.
Wow What a collaboration. 🤩
You wanna talk Lilly? 😂

#34 on trending
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 love this!!!!
Literally dead 😂😂😂
this is probably one of the best Lily Singh video I watched
Infinity war is the most ambitious crossover in history 
Me:
A wise man called her out on her BS (Not Dr.Phil) 
I love her but if she really wants to take care of her mental health she should put that first not YT
Hiiii Doctor Phil!
Ha
Dr. Phil’s face
This is literally 1980s comedy
thank you for putting the laugh track in, so i knew where it was supposed to be funny
ATTENTION TO ALL 9 YEAR OLDS




WE NEED DR PHIL ON MEME REVIEW
How can I take Dr. Phil seriously after this video 😹😹
MANGEET:I DANCE LIKE BLOODY PRABHU DEVA 
OH WHERE IS  #TEAMSUPERCHENNAI
wait
how did u
wait
how?
I'm dying😂
i sang mukkabilla song out loud
Im just here for Dr. Phil Swift
where the tamil squad at with prabhu deva
this is just awesome
All jokes aside, Lilly literally described my Indian life
xc
the impossible has just happened...
DR. PHIL HAS JUST BEEN ROASTED!
well actually i might be in correct considering this was a skit and also i myself have never seen dr. phil being roasted. i just killed my own comment and now i have nothing to comment on. i have a sad life
Tbh I only came for daddy Dr. Phil
Only watching because Dr. Phil is here
Our queeeeenn... and Lilly Singh
Idk why, but I found it cool when Lilly started to talk normal when dressed up as her dad :D
Thisssss is ICONIC
Dr. Phil is that u !?!?!?!
I think that mental break was great for u all of your content was and is amazing but I can really see the effort and ideas you put into your newest content
Collab with Russel Peters!
By far my fave of Lilly's videos
"hiatus"
Lilly is trending on SA trending page
WHY You agree to ARRAGNGED MARIIAGE if you not gonna accept stranger for who they are

i AM DYING
Lol lol lol lol 😂😂🤣🤣🤣
What did dr Phil do to deserve this
Meta, still doodoo
She is back with a bang!!!
#thebestchristmasgift
Lilly Singh with short hair 2:47 
Hhhhhmmmmm 🤔
This was sad, not funny. I think you need a longer vacation.
Yaaaaassssss Dr Phil
TO THE RANCH WITH YOU!!!
Taking a break btw
0: 47 lol @IISuperwomanII  you are amazing, Lilly 😘
Disclaimer: she left for 3 weeks. Calm down
I only watched this for Dr. Phil cause he’s a god
This was hilarious, made me laugh so hard
This should've been longer, awesome video lilly <3
It's more like your wasting Dr. Phil's time then making a "comedy" skit
Dr Phil... This is so true about Lily...
3 minutes of my life I'll never get back
Dr. Phil host lwiay
Prabu deva 
Mukala mukala 
Lol
Lilly is trending in SA!!!!!!!
This was pretty funny, good job!
2:32 No one is talking about how serious he was at that part?
Do a collab with the doctors
I actually didn’t expect the twist lol. Pretty dope
this is so cool!!
Okay but I have a feeling Beyoncé or Kim K is gonna be next wth
This is hilarious😂 so funny to see Dr Phil being in a comedy video when you're used to it being (somewhat) serious on his show 😂
Oh my god love the mukala reference!
This was a good video, am I the only one
That was just too good and too short. Enjoyed it very much👍 well done , Lilly ❤
4th wall demolished
Lilly on my top 10 hated list
This is just sad.
DR PHIL YESSSSS
Ju no wut problem is mr Phil?!?!!
PRABU DEVAA😉
😂this is good
That was hilarious🤪🤩😋😛😝😜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇯🇲🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇯🇲🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇯🇲
The only good thing about this video is Dr. Phil
well, I'm blind so I can't see... lol
1:47 well damn
Only liking because of Dr. Phil
Oh cool it's Supersandwichmaker
I could smell their BO through my monitor.
Lilly is becoming more irrelevant by the day.
Her switching accent is osm
pls get off youtube
As funny as lele pons
Is this the skit where Dr. Fulls first wife walks in while he gives marriage  advice.
mEnTal HelTh iZ SeRiUs gUyZ
Phew! I almost clicked on this with AdBlock disabled! I activated it on time.
It's so weird seeing Lily's "dad" talk with lily's voice
Since Dr. Phil is collabing with YouTubers,he should host meme review
This was too good
i appreciate the canned laughter to let me know when i am supposed to laugh.
If you are reading this it means that you are a awesome and cool person
Lilly crossing  all limits. Wow
Lily slayed Dr Phil.
*Danielle breggoli has entered the chat
HAAAAAHHHAAASHHHHHHSAAAAAASAAAAHHAAAAAAAAAAHSSAAAAAHHHHHHAAA I LOVE RACSTIC "COMADIE "
dayuuummm! on the trending page!
LOVED THIS. KILLING IT WITH THE CONTENT. ONE LOVE!!
Lily: Picks on her flaws. 
Some guy: Makes whole video about how Doctor Phil pointed out her flaws and makes fun of her. 

The hate is getting old. You don't like how she handles politics? That's fine you can respectfully disagree. Don't think she's funny? Don't watch her videos. You have no reason to be hateful towards anyone.
Daddy Dr Phil called you out
Is it werid I actually want to see her on Dr.Phil
Omg Dr.phill
Hahaha love the twist !
My mind still cannot mentally process that this collaboration actually took place.
This is awesome
lmaooooooooooooooooooooo this is what i needed
...these people are still more sane than some people on the show...
send her to the ranch.send her to the ranch.
send her to the ranch.
Prabhu deva😂😂
This is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
This was so good
When i saw the tittle I was mently preparing myself.
Tell him to host LWAY
This video is on SA's trending page!!!!!
Oh Yea, the views have gone up!
We know now what Pewdiepie has to react to nxt episode of dr. Phil
This is me
This is prefect
Anyone else wanna see Lilly and Izzy do a video
what dr phil is so random
2:40 was perfect , so does this mean Lilly is self-aware of her faults but just doesn't care?
Dr. Phil no honey noo..
This is so funny
next year put Dr phil in YouTube rewind
12 Collabs of Christmas is one of the best things of the holiday season!!
i needed this video to laugh.
Hahahha that was so meta and amazing!!!
me: “i’m gonna be productive today and stay off youtube”

Lilly: “comedy skit with Dr Phil gone wrong”

i’m never gonna get my work done😫
Dr.Phil deserves better
Please make Manjeet dance on TAKI TAKI (dj snake ..selena gomez....)
I loved your dad's jeans 😂
1:14 I didn't see that coming!
Who thinks every line they said was scripted 😁😂
Lol “I know what the script says, but I wanna talk to Lilly” 🤣 love this it’s great 😂
Could your parents react to Nicki Minaj good form video please!,,
I just realised I need to talk to Dr Phil
I LOVED THIS!
Omg this was so funny😂😂
1:32 Crew thinking WTF??
Was it Lele Singh or Lilly Pons? Eh, what's the difference.
I don't understand all the hate here.
I loved the video so much.It was funny and so deep.
Hilarious I'm sorry I'm new but I'm definitely subscribing
this was hilarious! Oh my gosh I can't believe you partnered with doctor Phil! Maybe Dr oz is next, who knows?!
okay dr.phill all we want you to do is HOST MEME R3VIEW
This was funny 😂
ITS JUST FUNNY DR PHIL NOW PLEASE SHUSH
This is pretty good
Did Lilly say eggs at the end? lol
Since when is Dr Phil a psychologist?
That dance brooo😭😭😭
To all the people that disliked this video,
   “Did u hit ur head on a pole?”
That was so,cute when dr Phil tried to recreate the hand signals just gah old peeps are adorbs
Idk why he look like he’s animated😂😂😂
Cus Lilly is Superwoman 😊
Lol Looks like she has 2 Spilt personality 😂
I would love to be on dr.phill 


But will probably pass out lol
Wasn't expecting one of the collabs to be Dr.Phil
TOO ICONIC
This is not funny 







Lol

Evrything on Dr.Phill gose wrong
Dr.Phil...Didn't see that coming ,did ya?
Yaaasssss prabu deva a kiiiiinnng of dance

So..what was the punch line?
I know lots of people are saying they don’t like this but I LOVE IT! I love that you got Dr Phil instead of another YouTuber
2:02 saammeee
#15 on trending in Pakistan ❤❤
Why do you always perpetuate Indian stereotypes?
Favorite video everrrr
OMG 😮 every scene is 😂 funny
I felt the second hand embarrassment 😂😂😂😂😂
Rose's are red,
Violets are blue,
I liked my own comment,
Because no-one else will do to.


Happy holiday xx🤗🤗
Things you lie about:not laughing at this video
What’s with Dr. Phil’s hands at the end lmao
It's time she grew out from this silly business.
How'd Lilly get dr. Phill to collab?
I like that prabhu deva part 😂😂😂😂
I like that prabhu deva part 😂😂😂😂
this is why she wont be in forbes top 10 next year either.
LILLY HAS BEEN KILLING THE VLOGMAS GAME! IM LIVING FOR THESE COLLABS QUEEN
When an actual doctor said you have a problem, isn't that concerning??? So are people still a fan of her stuff?
That was cool. I love Dad. Lol
I love Dr.Phil  yayyyy
😂😂😂😂💀💀💀
DR PHILL!!!!!!!!!!
You are a good actor
Love this
I’m the one that’s got to die when it’s time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to!
LOL !!!! Pareemjeet and manjeet is so funny

Happy Christmas Dr phil
it was weird seeing manjeet talk as lily OoF
Omg what?!?!
Oooooof I love this video
why did I not laugh through the whole of this it wasn’t even funny at all
Doctor Phil!!!!!!!!! I never thought you would do a colab with him. He is so nice :)
Daaannnng you’re firing it up this holiday season with so many vids! I LOVE IT!
Prabudeva...
Hahaha love it
🗿gang
So if Apu was voiced with a fake Indian accent, but by someone who at least had some Indian ancestry even if they were born/raised in Canada or the U.S., it would of been ok...🤔
People are so miserable, if you dont like Lily then unsubscribe or just dont watch. She's one of the few youtubers who is not problematic or clickbaity. Positivity goes a long way.
1:32 for a sec i thought it was real that she wanted to show us what the reality is and then ok its normal only
only here for "prabhu deva" !!! yeah!!!!!!!
Youtube Rewind 2018 was terrible!
How'd you do that effect where  "superwoman" was two people in one frame. I mean yeah photo shop but there's no visible mistakes
Dr Phil needs to send her to the ranch.
Do not be mad that men make better content then you thus making more money 💰
How was your "mental health" break from YouTube
About the laugh tracks..... I don’t think you all understand, but she put them in because... Dr. Phil.... obviously
I'm taking a break
Lily is everything wrong with youtube. It’s like MAD TV but 100 times worst.
AHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAH FUNNY INDIANS. O MY BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL O MY GEE
I love you Lilly  #tony
👌🏼
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! MY ONLY FAVOURITE YOUTUBER IS BACKKKKK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (of course after Miranda Sings)
😂 cant people take a joke dang
Lilly but what is happening with you
Jesus... and you wonder why you're not on the Forbe's list. Gotta be entertaining for that..
This got deep
I refuse to accept those are not her parents! Has my childhood been all a lie!? I refuse!
wonderful loved it
Wow this is worse for Dr Phil than that scandal about supplying an alcoholic backstage with booze.
Ok so this is funny
I thought you were taking a break
Go watch ImAlexx recent video
Even doctor Phil doesn’t find this funny
Poor phill he looks like hes so uncomfortable
Its like watching a hyper active 12 year old doing charecters after hearing a simpsons joke for the first time, god she really reveals how low people will humiliate themselves for internet love

Im depressed now
😂😂😂😂
Omg dr phil
Why would dr Phil do this.
Yasss 🤣🤣🤣
When the comments are funnier  than the actual video
😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
omgggg.....this shud be on trending....
only good thing about this was dr phil
dr phil knows the real problem
Literally just die please
You need to collab with Obamas, Shawn Mendes, James Corden
MIRANDA SINGS! :)
Make me a sandwich women
HELLO iiSUPERWOMANIi I LOVE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS EVERYDAY AND I ALSO LIKE IT TOO AND I ALSO THINK YOUR SO PRETTY AND BEAUTIFUL AND AWESOME AND AMAZING AND COOL TOO OKAY LILLY 💚💙💜😍🖤
This was deep. Dr. Phill actually pointed out the truth. The awakened ones see the truth, this was no joke.
https://youtu.be/wz5iZz-X0_g
People like me who were your fans are discovering other YouTubers like @naiomijon who are effortlessly funny the way you were back then.
These unexpected collabs are EVERYTHING🤩🤩
Omggg so creativ!!!!!!
A ad about TV doctors and real doctors came on before this video. 😂
It's sad that Dr Phil agreed to this
Loved it!
Lilly is killing the game with her #12CollabsOfChristmas
She always does the same characters
Even though i am not christian i love 12 collabs of christmas
Oh yes this is very funny haha i enjoyed this LOL 😂😂😂
Literally no one likes you anymore lol. Get off this platform if you cry about not being on the Forbes list 😂🤮
How much did u pay Dr Phil to do this nice laugh track
That last 3 seconds was the best part
Culture appropriation
Whoever has any issues or questions about this skit’s comedy, and/or Lilly’s mental health, or her reasoning behind her collabs/jokes, please refer to her behind the scenes videos... or just don’t watch ☺️ whatever makes you happiest of the choices provided 💗
GO AWAY HATERS!!! LILY IS AMAZING AND DOES NOT NEED HATERS TO CRITICIZE HER. IF YOU DONT LIKE HER VIDEO THEN FINE BUT DONT YOU EVER CRITICIZE SOMEONE BECAUSE YOU ARE INSECURE!!!



MY BESTIE WOULD SAY: you're irrelevant
Doesnt lisa do this?
Oh God, hearing lilly's voice out of manjeet's face is so weird. I know it's just her with 'a beard', but still! 😂
IM SCREECHING!!!! DR PHIL?! AN ACTUAL LIVING ICON 👏👏👏
These video are amazing 🔥 So good the inspired me to make my own channel👍 right now I'm hard working to success wish me luck💪 anyway keep up the good work👌😉
Philly is right.
Love you Lilly!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lol look at dr Phil trying not to laugh through the entire video
I wasn't expecting to see Dr Phill on your video 😮. We are having a documentary on physical things and he saw right through her manly beard disguise .
1:46-1:47 OHMYGODDDDDD I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH HER VOICEEEEEE
its sad when you need to put a laugh track in a video to try to make it funny
You Medical Doctor? 😂😂😂
Some times I think it’s ok for the earth to end
It's great to have her back
I can not look at Manjeet and Paramjeet as Lilly, ever!
He need some mILk
I guess Dr Phil threw an F bomb at her, literally smh
This is so funny! love u Lilly
WTH why is there so much hate? I think this is okay, not the funniest, but doesn’t deserve the hate!
LOVE THIS COLLAB. ICONIC. LIKE IF YOU AGREE
It is relateable.
Drama Alert Anyone?
Love!!!!!!!!!!
Sexist, Trans-phobic and most importantly unfunny.
Now we know what u did during your "break"
This is a completely unexpected collab !!! Lilly never fails suprising her fans...the long wait was worth it...
I can spend an hour just by reading this video's comments.
Dr. Phil is bad though, terrible for fake stories and exploiting real ones
THAT. WAS. REALLY. GOOD
I would pay million 4 doctor Phil to do a calb with pewdiepie
0:43 MADE ME FALL
Thought u left
I find this ultra cringey. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Sad...
2:05 😂❤️
Your content is tired
you know you’ve peaked on YouTube when you collab with dr phil
#12collabsofchristmas
What or when did this supposedly go wrong?
Yasss omg ilysm
Three minutes of my life I will never have back
You look like a man
How did your dad wipe away his beard?
Is that the real dr Phil ?
I mean, Dr. Phil seems right about some things...
Title checks out, definitely awkward.
3:14 did she just say bts?!?! 😶😶😶
This is dry
enjoying that mental health break?
What is this? Someone come get dr. Phil
If you look close you can see that dr phil is so confused
I LOVE this video
I loved this omg
  Next one Dolan twins ?😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mukkaala mukkabula😍
0:56 
My History teacher has a Ph.D and he gets so angry whenever I call him by Mr. Smith and not Dr. Smith. I still call him Mr. Smith. 😅😅
.
.
I know doctors work hard to get that ‘title’ and want to be addressed by that but hey you just gotta have fun sometimes with them
I thought she was on a break, contemplating her mental health issues, and TAKING A BREAK FROM MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS......." was it just a rank bro?"
4 views,1.9k likes....looks like YouTube has been drinking again.
Merry xmas
I thought Lele Pons wasn't funny I got proved wrong after watching this.
LMAO WHEN MANJEET TURNS INTO LILLY SHOOOKKKK 😂😂😂😂😂
Skittle Boys is in the comments!  Is what she said on Dr. Phil going to go viral Too!? Lol great video!
Great one Lilly
🤣🤣🤣
You should do a kpop parody
When do we get to meet your a real mom
That indian accent tho
T Series
This lol
Wasted 3:22 minutes of my life
I love dr phill
Just as I expected, she "went on a break" just to get views...
Where am I? Can someone please reply with a link for YouTube?
What’s happened to dr Phil’s face? Something looks really wrong with it.
Okay but dr.phils skin is so clear? Why does no one talk about this
this was hilarious looll
Prabhu Deva FTW!! 😁 😁
NO ONE EXPECTED FOR YOU TO COLLAB WITH THE DR PHIL!!
after you do your 12 collabs or xmas please go back into your break sis, you really need it. this video was iconic though
ur trending!!!
I  Y E E T  O N  Y O U R  F A T H E R 🍆💦🦍
Dr. Phil the god himself
Okay so I was just watching your old video “acting out my childhood stories part 2” and it was LITERALLY FORESHADOWING at 7:23 TO THIS VIDEO I AM SHAKING
Dr phil is the only thing in this bloody video that makes it parable to watch :,)
Can’t believe you now Prahbu Deva
this skit could have been so much more comedier but u decided to make it  go wrong wowowo no man whyyy???????????//
This vid is Supa meta

I doubt that anybody will care..but I started Youtube not long ago and my goal is to reach 2K before Christmas , just liking this comment to bring more attention would help...God bless🙏🙏🙏
What do these two even do anymore
I’m guessing the break is done?
Who’s here before this video gets to one million
First and l love your video so much so funny and your mom is funny and your dad to love your video your dad always  is funny
This is cringeworthy
I thought she was taking a break to take care of her mental health? 🤔🤔🤔
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻‼️😆
Mental health am I right
Phil in the blanks hahaaa
I feel bad for Dr. Phil.

Wowowow😍
Lilly we really appreciate your effort and new ideas x ignore everyone tryna put you down.
Prabhu Deva 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Mental health she says. Exhausted physically, mentally, emotionally, spirituality she says. Continues making videos she does.
That manjeet mumbling muqabla tho shshs
TRENDING!!!!
I was so sad when she said she was gonna leave yt bc there wouldn't have been 12 days of christmas
I love what you did here!! And did you know that Eric Jerome Dickey mentioned you in one of his books? The Blackbirds. It made me smile to read you get recognition from a famous author, I've been reading his books for years.. 💜❣
Oh wow. This sucked
😂😂😂😂
That twist though
Wow this was Awesomeness...
Why am I getting suggestions for someone I'm not even subscribed to!?! Stop that!

YAAASS GREAT VIDEO LUV U LILY AND THAT PRABHU DEVA REFERENCE THO YAASSS!👌👌👌😘💕❤️
Haha this hella GEY
Why is the comment section so negative, both of these people are amazing.
Dr phill collabs with superwoman but not pewdiepie?
That was pretty lame
LOLLLLLLLL
It is 00:20 here and i legit jumped with excitement because of this!!!
Love you superwoman! 
Where is my #TeamSuper?
p.s : Lily coming back with quality content!
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
I chuckled  ._.
1:15 LILLY BEEN EXPOSED
i thought this was fake
Dr phil cant handle the indian pressure bestowed on him so he ignores the script
Im not understanding all the hate and the complaining over her break. She is the one that decides what is an appropriate time for her to rest. Its her health not ours. If you feel that she has not evolved or such, it is ok to give constructive criticism but there is no need to bring a person down especially if you wouldn't want the same for herself. I loved the 12 days of collabs. Keep up the good work
we want a collab with Ellen
I like it. it was nice
793 likes and 3 views. Man, this is the best! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cool but cringe
YAS
I like this one. F the other people
Wait I’m confused I thought you were taking a break. Cool vid though
Hey lily lysm my inspiration I can’t relate to u bcos I’m a India girl😂your the best💖
Comment section time!! 
Bunch of negative comments telling Lily her video sucks and how it's disappointing
OK NO THANKS



Btw, y'all, some people might think that lilly changed, but she changed for us. I respect your opinion, but you also got to know that being a YouTuber is hard. She's trying her best for her audience, and we should all be grateful for that. Respect how she's changed instead of dissing it, because she's doing it for us.
Why is there so much hate?? I loved the video
Forced jokes
LOVED IT
I must need a little couch time....
I can remember when the word comedy was used to describe something as being funny, humorous, laughable, or otherwise entertaining.
Felix is gonna be so mad
Amazing
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
the comment section is toxic. Having an opinion or constructive criticism is one thing and putting people down is another.
This is so jnfunny
guys, you're being so mean! Like chill! i thought it was funny and she's still recovery mentally it's not like she's gonna pop out after like 2 weeks as good as knew. Everything you're commenting is just making it worse just be more positive! i thought the acting was spot on and the script was super clever
One like = 1 chocolate bar 🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫
Nice mental health break

👏👏👏👏👏👏
This was so funny
Those dislikes though.
Prabu Deva fans?
Us think.Do you really think
“Comedy”
If you hate lily, don't watch her.  it gives her some sweet coins.
Lily your next collab should be learning how to dance with Maddie and kenzie.
only Lilly would collab with DR PHIL LMAO
This reminds me a video where someone interwiew a lady with multiple personality disorder that I watch last night because youtube recommended it
https://youtu.be/8zcxNF7YtM4
Please,when you said goodbye we was hoping it would be permanent and not just for attention seeking. Get out.
Who else got the Just Destiny reference at 1:20 ? what if he and lilly collabed?
4 views and 1400 likes? YouTube needs Dr phil
😂😂😂😂😉

comedy has left the chat
Hi Lilly I loved this it was so funny also I just want to say about your tweet about the Forbes list is don't listen to the haters and that I know that you are just concerned about lack of female representation
Haters ➳ Motivators , for all of yall saying her videos arent funny anymore .
Damn you guys take it easy!!

I'm so happy she's back and happy💜💜💜
Guys you need to chill she works hard and you guys don’t see it so just leave her alone jeez
Why so much hatred?
😂😂😂😂😂😂
looooooool
I thought she quit
I am from india and I am in Canada woah and prabhu deva is a dancer..
That was funny
Dr. Phil gets paid more than you, does that mean he’s sexist.
😂😂😂
OMG YESSSS
This was unexpected and hilarious!!! Paramjeet always makes me laugh. "how dare you say this in front of Dr. Phil?" 😂
💛
This video !!!!!!
Muqabla amazing
😂
I dont understand why i dont like her anymore ... She is pretty and  kind of funny... But.. I dont know
This was awkward. Haha
Why do my eyes hurt
Please collab with Shane Dawson 💓💓💓💓
Fuckin liar
So all I learned from reading the comments is that something happened so people just dicided to judge her the whole time instead of enjoying a video and moving on to another one wow good job.
LAMAFO!
this is "comedy" "gold"
How did she get dr Phil!?!?!
Blooooooooooooooooooooooooooody
😂😂😂😂😂😂

I thought you took a brek.
God, your humour is so smart 🔥. Love you superwoman
Ohhh philly
Collab with Rosanna Pansino please!!  😊😀😀😁😁😃
Omg. Every time Lilly wiped that makeup wipe on her face is every tear raining down my face as my childhood burns on fire realizing that my childhood idol Manjeet is a fake.
Yow when he called out Lilly I DIEDDD😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mental health???
But this was funny tho but i bet it was awkward to film.
Is this supposed to be funny?
Wait so the mom is actually a different person???
this is the colab i never knew i wanted
I'm sorry you had to be a part of this terrible skit Dr. Phil.
STOOOPID
Remember when the bum fights dude when on Dr Phil and he dressed up just like him?  That guy was a huge @$$** but still I have to give it to him that was hilarious.
Prabhudeva😍
I can’t understand them except for dr phil
I thought she was on a break?
Prabhu Deva!
Check out celebrities with weird hidden talents.....Dr.Phil can do a wheelie on a dirt bike
I thought you were going to take a break?
ok
Hi
This is going to break Pewdiepies heart.
LILLY Cringe
where are the jokes
Sssniperwolf should react to this video
You can get Dr. Phil to be on Superwoman's channel but he won't host YIAY?
I had high hopes
I LOVED this!!! it was so funny and eye opening at the same time lol!
I’m just confused as to how they managed to get both parents in the shot at the start since Lilly is acting as both parents???
You are my idol. I love your vids so much. My whole family loves you. And especially the ones with your parents
this is the peak of comedy
It's so wired hearing Lilly's voice in her father's character😂😂
Fantastic
This is such a unexpected collab but I love this it's great !!! 💕
I already know I'm going to love it 😂 haven't watched it yet
☹️☹️☹️☹️
First!!!
This just shows how fake the show is...
a ‘dumbhead’....
Prabhu Deva was soo good😀😀
Lmao
Wow I just realized how much makeup Dr. Phil wears😂Also please stop with the hate you guys. Seriously.
Are you still depressed?
I guess this is her version of a mental health break... doing a video with dr phil 😂😂
This ain’t funny
I cant even think of anything to comment because im literally laughing so hard I'm crying 😭😂
Ay! SUPAWOMAN PewdiemuddafukkinPie called you an Idiotas! OOOOOOUUUUUU~!
Nonce
lily is speaking the truth parents always think about what other people think and dont really think about their children or what their children want like if you agree
Next collaboration is with Thanos.
1:55
Lyer
3 is Donald Trump
Lilly check Snapchat. You are sort of featured on the discovery page called Face Forward and it's so good.
😂
Qué  lástima por ti hija  qué  no  te  valoras
taking a break from yooutube cause mental health by collabing with a tv shrink thats a new one
Stop trying to create a problem out of nothing with the Forbes stuff 😴😴
HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHHAHAHHAHAHHAAH!
Tbh,I find the plot twist is creative lilly,entertaining story too and has good funny lines but just not good enough to make me laugh,I can sure theres others that find it hillarious though
I think this girl is copying Lisa Kishogi (spelling?...) But Lisa is not copyable. Lisa is better and original.
COLLAB WITH ADAM SALEH PLZZZZZZ
Lilly only exists to make advertisers happy
Oops
#19ontraining
You know if you’ve gotten somewhere if your friends with dr.phil
Maybe a collaboration will get you the views you need to get on Forbes top 10 YouTubers. Then you can really defeat the sexism of men doing better than you
This is like Asian parents except you would get beat if you tried to get them to listen
“All I want my parents to do is U N D E R S T A N D” 😓
Wow
Dr. Phil, please host Meme review.
❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So you "taking a break" was to get more viewers interested in your 12 collabs of Christmas? Wow.
These stereotypes make us Indians look bad. Lilly’s life is her biggest oopsie
You are the female version of fouseytube.
How iconic is this ??????
How is this even funny
Any Indian is here ?
Damn
Why isn't there a place to report this content creator for lying to her audience for views 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Name a hotter guy than Dr Phil

I'll wait...
I must say i dont like most of your content but this was great. If you want to appeal to a wider audience produce content like this instead of the dead SWJ content.
whatttt!!!!!!!!! lovveee..
Hey Lilly, as much as  I'm glad to watch your videos (I've been watching for more than 5 years) I'm a little concerned about your mental health. I hope your break is going well and you're trying to RELAX as much as you can. you're honestly one of the most CARING and DEDICATED people on this platform, maybe even on the internet. Remember numbers don't define success. I have to go to school now so I'll cut it short. I love you for being you. Have a nice day <3
???????
YESSS BEEN WAITING FOR THE SECOND COLLAB ALL DAY AHAHAHAHA
Wtf did i just watched
I really think Lilly needs to take a break. I love her a lot but this was not funny.
😂😂😭😂😂 😂
isnt lily acting as both of them? how duz that work?
Damnnnn we got Dr.Phil 😂😂
Love u Lilly ❤️💖💞💗💘💕
