Hank Green: Billy Nye 2.0 and Ms.Frizel 3.0

Jack when's your comedy mixtape dropping
the fact that i share a birthday with sonic the hedgehog scares me
Burger King is going to FLAME you. LOL #feelyourway
If you think Ariana Grande follows a lot you should fix Lil B's bio
This reminds me of this one dream I had where Avengers: Endgame overtakes Avatar (2009) as the highest grossing film of all time
The Mark Ruffalo bio should have been "I HATE STAIRS"
Thank little baby jesus ! Your hiatus has been killing me üò≠üòÇ
that flashback roomie at 5:24 hit me in the feels jack.. i miss the old days
6:10 Me after I finish my AP world history exam tomorrow
Everyone's bio should be "Watch Endgame, beat Avatar"
he actually changed his bio....
don't be nervous, you'll barely feel it.
I got ptsd when I heard that song 5:24
Dubstep fixes everything
Oh yeah twitter I forgot about that see I got locked out of my account because my parents attached my account to my house phone rather than my cell phone.  So so much for having Twitter

Edit: God I wish this was a joke
Do James Charles or else he will make you gay
I litterally went and checked ninja's bio Because idfk.
should‚Äôve done the Avengers bio
4:05 "DAB"
Yo anyone know what pissed burger is getting called in the UK?
i love how he actually changed his twitter bio
Hi jack I‚Äôve never watched your videos but what peanut butter
YouTube should make a award for best at transitions on YouTube and give the award to Jack honestly
6:06
Is that a reference from somewhere?
those tom holland ones were the best
Do a describe endgame in 4 word
0:48  Baldi? Is that you?
Gotta love jack for making never done before content without long ads!
You should change your channel name to jacksads
Doesnt even acknowledge hes been gone longer than my dad
I like how he actually changed his bio
Wait his video is longer than 5 mins?
Why does the official Sonic the hedgehog Twitter have more followers than Ninja
he actually changed his bio on twitter üòÇ
That was such a trap card... I was forced to watch the ad that time jack
Jack is the lord of the rings
im waiting for someone to request Sarah J. Maas 
unless its been done
Trumps bio: If I block you, considering it being "walled"
Don't ask......

"don't do mine" ok has gotta be really good.

I lost it after he read Mark Ruffalos great bio and changed it to "Let's SMASH that avatar record. ..I have a problem"
Dammit John, now I need to go watch "Dubstep solves everything 3" again.
In the next episode can you fix my marriage?

Instantly liked the video when I heard ‚ÄúLOOK ME IN THE EYE AND YOU‚ÄôLL SEE WHAT I BEEN TRYIN TO TELL YOU‚Äù
‚ÄúTerrible, horrible, no good, very bad.‚Äù
I understood that reference
3:56 No he doesn‚Äôt actually. You see God has stopped giving him the script.
I was literally going to unsub if you hadn't changed your Twitter bio for real. Ya didn't disappoint.
When is his big project gonna come out
ah yes, the (Swimming In That) Green brothers
Your twitter bio is the best ad.
Damn this was honestly his best video in a while
i cried when i found out that‚Äôs NOT ninjas bio
I can't wait to go to Burger King and get a yass meal.
Toby Masters gotta be so mad
5:19 Damn that one sound bite brought me to tears üò¢ the good ol days
dubstep solves everything 3 in a jacksfilms video?

dubstep solves everything 4 confirmed
i got avatar as a recomendation
This is giving me deja vu
He did change his bio! Hell yeah committment
Change your bio too: Watch Endgame. Beat Avatar
Ooooh thats an new sponsor 



For once
3:08 I really think you mean 1st jack
You know who I am
He actually made his twitter that lol XD
is it de ja vu or I already saw some of this footage in older video....
Grandayy is Seth evermann confirmed
Do @jacksfilms bio
I can't believe actual sponsers now
I have a problem laughs in endgame
ring helped my dad get a camera
That oo rap sounds familiar
Was that a teaser for the new "dubstep solves everything"?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FACE
Literally why do we need more avatar.
#YIAYGOT Arron rogers come out of the grave and kill's Mike McCarthy for Losing to Arizona on week 13
Man. I have legitimately missed Won‚Äôt Back Down.
You actually changed your bio. You absolute madman.
I feel like you ran out of ideas for this episode.
Omg lol I actually thought that jacksepticeye filmed this
HANK SWIMMING IN THAT GREEN GOT ME LAUGHING
that dubstep solves everything 3 clip takes me back
your bio should say Bio for Twitter
Wow! Ninja actually has a really good b-
U sneaky bastard
Can we get some F's for the changes animators are gonna have to make?
They should change sonic's bio to: "Uhhhh... Meow?"
Psh I heard Jacks and flipped...lmao hi I'm Jax
Had no idea james Cameron did T2...Learning something new everyday...Jack's like a damn Snapple
Maybe he can fix amino bios too that would be great
@James Charles fix it please
I'm not ashamed to admit I actually thought that was Ninja's bio, but I guess I did give him too much credit
5:23 I laughed SO HARD when the music started...
I actually like the new sonic
WHY WOULD THEY MAKE 4 ALL AT ONCE
Did u have to use the lords name in vain
I heard that Dubstep song that you made, Jack.
Hank ‚Äúswimming in that‚Äù Green. Brooooooo
@ninja i feel u bro
You should fix stan lee's bio
WAIT THERE RELEASING 4 MORE AVATARS....*REST IN PEACE MARVLE IT WAS GOOD WHILE IT LASTED*
Jack can we go to all of the new avatars together
After over a year of them being married it still sounds weird when he says "My wife"
I havent watched u in a long time, jack. Hi how r u
I don't think you've even seen Ring, Jack :/
Funny af, thanks Jack I needed this
You really made me check Ninja‚Äôs twitter
God damn, Fix your Bio is always very funny.
Petition to release all of jack's raps as a compilation
Grandayy got used as a spon segway
If you remember the song from 5:24 you r entitled to a veterans discount
I love ip-cameras. If you know how, they are pretty easy to hack into. YaY we're all gonna be controlled by the government
I love how people have the power to get a face changed in a movie. That's amazing
Serious comment: thank you sooooo much for bringing this back, especially since it's my favorite series on your channel!
Serious comment: thank you sooooo much for bringing this back, especially since it's my favorite series on your channel!
5:02
I fell so bad for Toby
Listen, Jack, I get that Ring‚Äôs a great product but buddy...how many of us do you think own our own homes
Nest is bankrupt. Ring's next
I liked the video only because of 5:22.
ok but the person who asked to fix James Cameron's bio has Chaeyoung from Twice as their picture and I can only focus on the fact that there are other jacksfilms fans who are also Once xD
5:25 You know what I call that? Dubstep Solves Everything 4 foreshadowing
fix lil b the based gods bio
How about a fix your Grindr bios?
Didn't Endgame smash the Avatar record already?!?
avatar 5 releases on my birthday
Video ends at 7:00 üòéüòé thank me later!
OH GOD 666 DISLIKES!!!
Sonic only has 70 followers in the thumbnail?



I‚Äôm not surprised now that I think about it.
Now I gotta go watch "Dubstep fixes everything 3"
0:01 I already have one
he actually changed his bio!
TOM HOLLAND KNOWS EXACTLY HOW AND WHEN YOU DIE.
You are a genius, Jack!
I just checked jack's twitter bio, he actually made his bio that....i'm impressed
dubstep solves everything 4 confirmed?
Ring is basically monetizing security
YGS every Friday?
Fix @lightgullyyt 's bio its Garbaggio
Tom Holland seems older than me, but he's actually younger than me...
Holy shewt his rapping at 5:45 is sick!!
1:00 knowing the Sonic twitter blog, it would not even surprise me if they did something like that.
okay what was Ninja's actual bio
Have to summarize your entire personality
8:02 , thank goodness he repeated, I almost can not write it down.
Ring the 2019 version
Can i get my ring to say PRANKED every time some one rings my doorbellllllll?
I can't homie.....   Facebook only
When Fix your Twiter Bios is more recurrent than JACKASK
So is this your big project Jack??
OK BUT JACKSEPTICEYE FOLLOWS YOU
.

He really did change his twitter bio üòÇ
I had to stop the video and rewatch the dubstep solves everything trilogy. Nailed it.
I lost my ring
Me: ‚ÄúTom Holland‚Äôs first fixed bio is cute!‚Äù
John on the 2nd fixed bio for Tom: ‚ÄúSpider-Man can climb walls...Tom Holland knows when and how you‚Äôll die.‚Äù
Me: ‚Äúwell, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised‚Äù
That extra fanservice for Captain Beardy

In general, Jack has reminded me yet again of how irritating it is that we‚Äôre not allowed to make a new paragraph for our Twitter bios after clicking ‚ÄòEnter‚Äô
If someone says "thank u, next" I'm not talking to them, it's just bitchy
The microphone is gone
I DIDNT SEE YOU TWEETED THIS! h
My dentist place have a ring doorbell- I think ring is spreading like the plague
This is the best birthday gift I cloud have asked for
What happened to the landscaping guy?! Dont leave us hanging!!
R....

No
G....
Can't you just put out a rap album and make my life complete???
1:40 yes they did jack, they made mini spongebob memes squishy toys
HOW DID HE GET THE DAB EMOJI
Amazing segue
For Tom Holland I would put I don't feel so good
the amount of sponsers you get is unprecidented
maybe u shouldnt make ur bio an add its just meeeeeeeeeeh
shoulda ended ariana's bio with a "yuh"
We need another YIAY!
I heard that dubstep solves everything 3 reference. I wonder if that means number 4 is around the corner finally.
Please fix James Charles and ProJared
I am kinda proud of my bio, but please fix it :)  #fixbio      (its brunerhalee)
You should take a look at my Instagram bio. I‚Äôm pretty proud of it. @infamousdaves
what happens if the thief just covered your ring camera
What‚Äôs the question for the next yiay?



Wait a minute
Shoulda fixed James Charles'.
Madman actually fixed his own bio
Oh that good good dubstep haha
Might need to fix your sponsor link
Have you seen endgame yet
A better bio for Nickelodeon:
We're responsible for Dan Schneider. We're not sorry.
5:23 HE USED THE SONG
THE SONG
Lol identity reference
Pppffftt who uses Twitter?
5:17 I just remembered why I love you, Jack
A good idea for YIAY is doing the kidz bop guessing the lines! That was funny and enjoyable!
The way your wife holds the phone horizontally makes me so unreasonably angry
He played us like a damn fiddle!
Jack has better bars than Logic these days.
holy crap the mad man actually changed his bio to "can we talk about ring"
fun fact: vilissa thompson blocked me on twitter because i replied to her the definiton of racism on a racist tweet
Ring .com / Jack'sass
I stayed for the ad read, because your segway made me laugh.
I thought you were gonna change Mark Ruffalo‚Äôs to ‚Äúgreat value leonardo dicaprio‚Äù
Haha! "Louder Markiplier"! That's great. I'm gonna be using that from now on.
Has his forehead gotten bigger?
Do another fake facts please!!!
I think I'm going insane, there are 2 parts in this video that I'm absolutely sure you recycled,  the burger king one, which I'm only 90% sure about, and the Captain Beardy one, which I'm 99.999...% sure about. There may be more, Jack is a lazy shmuck.
TOMS THOUGH MG IM DEAD
wow that dubstep solves everything 3 throwback
No I really wanted him to fix mine
My friend uses ring to watch her drunk aunt sneak into the house at 3AM
Your sponsor link doesn't work yo
Yes, but you pay the landscaper? I don‚Äôt like unfinished endings.
Who went to twitter to find if he really change his bio?
one ring to rule them all
5:26 That was a nice throwback song
Is jacksepticeyes twitter pic a pic for tinder or is it me?
Make tom hollands "mr stark, i dont feel so good"
Did Jack just dodge fixing his bio by doing the advertisment??



10 questions science still cant awnser
Hahahaha that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do mine‚Äù one killed me hahaha

My new favorite video
The mad lad actually changed his bio
Why is Avatar in my recommended?
Fix Jamaica‚Äôs flag. plz. even tho its not yiay.
Ring looks like something out of Black Mirror.


Btw, season 5 comes out in June and it's only half as depressing as seasons 3 and 4.
A reverse uno card
People that are like 14 and below watch your videos. That sponsorship is useless. But I still love you
Top ten boyz return when
Damnit I was really hoping that was actually ninjas bio grr
Tom Holland doesn't think he's too cool to have a bio, he's just an 80-year-old man who doesn't know how technology works.
For those wondering John did change his bio
dude where is joe goes???
I actually liked the old Sonic movie design.
Ba-RING-a
Dude you can't just sneak in the chorus of dubstep solves everything 3 like that
The misconceptions about fixing Sonic's design are getting out of hand. They already have the animation done, they can just swap the model and tweak the movements a little.
omg you're still relevant
Twitter bio tier list?
Have you ever fixed people's Instagram??
Jack. YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE YAAAS MEAL.
I haven't watched you for like two months and you seem depressed for some odd reason I am amazed you're not getting burnt out
‚ÄúYaaaas Meal‚Äù
The ring link doesn't work.
Dubstep Solves Everything 3 intensifies
How tf does the sonic twitter have 2 million subs more than Nickelodeon
5:24 why is that so damn funny
big project joke
Ring soinc ring
dr grandayy ?

Hey
I always knew Tom Holland was superior to all of us peasants.
Holy shit, "wont back down" throw back.
Jokes on you I already have ring!
Dubstep Solves Everything 4 now please
What do you think of mine? Maybe I should change it. ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
Can your Twitter bio not be a sponsor?
ring app, a product you will rarely use because no visits you.
You should do Todd Howard
Jack:Twitter is a hellish nightmare world, where angry people scream at each other for clower.


It's funny because it's true, I mean all social media does this, but this is to funny lol! üòÇüòÇüòÇüëç
5:24 that song rly brought me back
3:24 jacksepticeye fixing his own bio.
Movie sonic looks like the kind of sonic you'd get at party city
I feel sad for Toby üòÇ 5:00
Tom Holland‚Äôs is actually probably to inept to have a bio lol. By that I mean he‚Äôs not good at twitter
This video was actually funny for a bit, gj!
I came and I camed, I concurred.
For Klout!
He‚Äôs already done Mark Ruffalo
Glad to see you look a lot more happier in this video!
Hey did you see End Game yet?
I would have called Nickelodeon ‚Äúhiring minor foot loving directors‚Äù
"I have no life"
these are getting increasingly less funny
Fix @SonicMovie
I like watching shows like this so much that I've seen it eight times.
Do mine please it Isaac Davis
Now he only does videos that are sponsored  #capitalism
Tom Holland is more powerful than God
fUCKKKK YESSSS FKFKFK
Nickelodeon bio but I fix it:

Welcome to Nickelodeon! We‚Äôre only popular because of 90s kids and one of our money makers is that one girl from dance moms who wears ponytails with bows all the time. We ruin memes that were based on our shows. Have fun!
He managed to make his horrifying bio even worse. And now I'm extremely mad
5:23 Wow 6 years now and your still using that song, John?
He pulled that soundbyte right out of 2008 didn't he?
For anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to look it up on their own, Ninja‚Äôs actual bio is: Business: business@teamninja.com
8!? I missed like all of them.
5:03 you really did me dirty
‚ÄúYou see, Spider-Man can climb walls and stuff, but Tom Holland knows exactly how and when you die‚Äù
Tom Holland is actually Dr Strange, not Spider-Man
‚ÄúFor clout‚Äù
       -Jack
I'll open twitter just for you
Tire vs tyre
So you're just not even reading YouTube comments anymore huh?
God damnit Jack, I've been waiting for SO GODDAMN LONG
You do realize that my bio is almost literally just waiting for you change it?
PLEASE DUDE.
"You see, Spider-Man can climb walls and stuff but Tom Holland knows exactly how and when you die."






I don't know why that made me laugh so loudly but-
your echo scares me
i forgot u existed and i just found u again and im so happy vv nice
Too bad Ninja's actual bio is as bland as he is
Daddy back
5:24 
Can someone please tell me what that song is?
Welp, time to keep trying.
5:23 dubstep solves everything 4, confirmed
i read bios like, computer BIOS  lmao

A i R ee Ahna Grande
That was fire
Finnaly..
Some are so lame. I love Sonic and they destroyed his!
wait this ain't yaiy?
The next Avatar movies will not gross as high as the first.
"climate change advocate" implies he wants the climate change to happen.
While we're on the topic of Hank Green, he looks just like Gregor Mendel...
2:13 Chaeyoung!!!!!!
That‚Äôs not really ninja‚Äôs bio for anyone who didn‚Äôt know
BUT MY BROTHER HAS RING
20 on trending
LOOK ME IN THE EYE
mmm that transition was smoother then your forehead
Still got that dubstep solves everything sound byte I see
0:43 Blueface Jack
Jack acts like I have a house
AVATAR 3 IS ON MY BIRTHDAY. NOOOOOOOOO
I only ever see ring doorbells in rich neighborhoods. So what‚Äôs the point.
Know one who actually needs a safer neighborhood can afford it
In 6:35 he wanted you to fix your bio but then he made a huge mistake by putting a uno reverse card so now you have to fix his!
Bruh the Thanos dubstep...
isn‚Äôt it tyre not tire mr ygs?
Only thing better than the rap was that segway into the sponsor
I stopped watching Abraham when he didn't feature me in YoAY. Shane on you
When this was trending oh he is
the dubstep in real life song made me feel nostaliga, i didn¬¥t realise jack could make me feel
Jesus this is the 8th?
FIX YOUR BIOS üòÇ
Oh cool, an acknowledgement Dubstep Solves Everything exists
i thought the burger king meals were made up
Yo im like early ... 7/8 hours early get rekt nerd
I hope Captain Beardy changes it to that
i miss jack
Dubstep solves everything 3 music for the true fans
Who else checked ninjas bio if that‚Äôs actually was it
Eeewwww!!! Oh My God. Sonic is ugly!!!
5:23 it's been YEARS since I last heard this one
You look kinda like the Agent from the Matrix.
The introduction to today's sponsor was literally worst than last week game of thrones episode... So disappointing
7:27 Is it me?Or does Erin look different.
It‚Äôs spelt ‚ÄúBayou‚Äù not ‚ÄúBio‚Äù
Only old fans will remember LOOK ME IN THE EYE.
I miss you jack
Next time, fix '@jack'!
U sound like ur in a bathroom
5:21 inb4 this is foreshadowing Dubstep solves Everything 4
The director said they were gonna reanimate something
Make a "fix my twitter bio" where everyone gives you a new bio and you actually use your favorite one
beak londike
You are a very killable guy
The most sponsored channel on YouTube anyone knows why
JESUS IS GOD
If only bio's could be that long
I'm really happy you stopped holding the mic and put in on a stand like a real man.
AIRiana grande
They are making more avatar movies? Why?
If he says beat avatar one more time, im gonna jump off the golden gate bridge and join Bruce Lee in the afterlife

Yiay 469 when?
#YIAY69420mlg uwu
What's the song at 5:23?
Why do you need Ring Jack? Don‚Äôt you sit at home all day?
5:24 what a throwback
God damnit Toby
This is the second time you‚Äôve used grandayy‚Äôs comment to a segway into a sponsor he gonna be pissed
Tom Holland knows exactly how and when you'll die
The real reason Tom Holland doesn't have a bio is cause he doesn't know how to use social media.
5:25 I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever not felt so good in my life
Robert Downing jr. Bio:    you know who i am
Im pretty sure people would watch and make the new avatar movie the highest grossing film just for the memes
oh it's that song you always use
5:24 and that's destiny fullflilled
Thanks for putting that song randomly in the video. Now I have to watch Dubstep solves everything and a bunch of Mike Diva videos
jack theres a yaaas meal
5:23 nostalgia attack
Why does Ninja have more followers than Tom Holland
2:00 I hate to tell you this but gossip girl was burned by a dragon fir betraying the queen
5:23
Classic
Did anyone else go back and watch all 3 dubstep vids? Good times. I miss the old jacks films and ygs
You already did Mark Ruffalo's!
Ring our motto is if someone tries to break into your house we send a little creepy dead again girl to attack them!
You could‚Äôve used Tom Holland‚Äôs first fixed bio for Mark Ruffalo. He‚Äôs a spoiler boy too!
tom holland doesn't know when I'm gonna die because I didn't let him read the script
2:48 yaaaas meal
The Tom Holland one üòÇ 3:29
Game of thrones will end of a rat eating cheese the thanos snap everyone #YIAY
I was going to a party and accidentally went to the wrong house and they had a ring doorbell, I tried to open the door and it started talking and the lady in it said she was calling the police :(
Where the dab emoji
i need you to make some weeb vids with @Commentiquette
wasn't the bio at 5:42 in a previous video?
Beak Londike.
Ok but what about a video where we try to fix  y o u r  bio
While we were out for the day at Disneyland
5:20 ur welcome
What was that song?
Tom Holland's hair is so big because of all the leaks he's ready to drop.
An incredibly remarkable thing???
5:26 lolll is that from Dubstep Solves Everything 3?
So basically, "I'm gonna fix your life".
You think you can play the DSE 3 song and not make a DSE 4? You toy with my emotions, John Patrick Douglass.
whats the song at 5:23?
Does anyone even use Twitter anymore???
Does that count as DSE 4?
Where is the next question :(
i thought this video is about fixing BIOS

This is my favorite jacksfilm video.
Thanos fortnite dancing to dubstep solves everything 3 really hit me like a truck
i think jacksfilms photoshops his forehead.  its starting to look not as big.
you live an hour away from disneyland
Twitter is hate!
I love that he actually changed his twitter bio. When I was going to Twitter, I thought he isn't cool enough to actually change it but he did.
You should make a fixing Instagram bios
Am I the only one here thinking the endgame beat avatar meme is lazy
7:13 For some reason I'm picturing Jack screaming down the phone while he's on a ride at Disneyland
To bad spongebob is disbanding soon... R.I.P
how about you fix ur yt pfp
finally he is not lazy now  after months
What if your ring package got stolen because you didn‚Äôt have the ring. :/
Can you do a YGS Trump Edition, please? There are so many mistakes he has made on Twitter alone that it deserves its own episode!
With the Nickelodeon one, I thought you were gonna do a meme about Dan "show me your feet and I'll beat my meat" Schneider, so slightly disappointed...
i was kindo hoping louder markiplier would comment on this vid
I loved the little "wee" at 2:23
E C H O
LOOK ME IN THE EYES
I‚Äôm glad he changed it for real. Was about to get upset.
Fix your flags 2.
Who else thought that was Ninja's real bio?
My dad loves avatar

Should fix your sponsor's bio sometime
Everyone on Twitter is trying to be edgy
Some how this espisoda didnt have that emotion :/ sucks2suck

#beatavatar
What u don‚Äôt tell abt ring is u get a million notifications from ur family walking inside and outside

I personally think Camerons bio should read "They made me make more avatar or they wouldn't let me make the Battle Angel Alita movie I've been wanting to make for decades"
You did us dirty jack

How much would it suck to FINALLY make it on YIAY, just to be skipped because you were trying to be funny?
What makes #gottafixfast even worse is that most animation studios don't get paid for reshoots
Do I hear "Won't Back Down" by Roomie featuring Jacksfilms, Element Animation, Tomska and others at 5:23?
You should fix the try guys‚Äô bio

Great video jack üëç
i tought he was gonna put ‚Äòbacon eggs‚Äô in ariana grandes bio
Here's a fun Ring story for you;
One time I was cruising through my city with some friends. We decided to pickup another friend. I rang the fancy Ring bell and stood waiting there for a good 2 minutes. Just when I was about to head back for the car, I heard a scratchy sound coming from the corner of their front garden. It was a hedgehog (I believe his name was Sonic). I went over to my friends and ask them to bring a flashlight. We petted the poor animal a bit and drove off. We went to the high way and drove about 120 miles an hour when we saw a flash. My friend who was driving was really scared for the enormous fine. After that we got a call from the friend we wanted to pickup earlier. What had happened? Apparently his parents watched the Ring footage and thought we were burglars because we were suspiciously 'inspecting the house' with a flashlight. His parents went to our friend who was at work with the footage of the Ring system and asked if he recognized us. He did, but didn't admit that. Consequently, the parents had sent the footage to the police and headed home waiting for when we would return with a baseball bat. Now, naturally we hadn't broken into the house, but imagine the image the police must've gotten frim us: first they receive the images of 4 guys with a black Range Rover inspecting a house with a flashlight and 15 minutes later they receive the report of a black Range Rover leaving town with 120 miles an hour.

Well if that doesn't look suspicious, I don't knoe what does.
Thanks Ring.
So dubstep solves everything 4???
‚ÄúAIRiana grande‚Äù
Yeah ring is very useful
Those poor animators. They are so fu
Honestly, jack is sponsored so much we should get a warning when it ISNT SPONSORED INstead or when it is
Jack took rap lessons from lil pump. ‚ÄúOo‚Äù
Dubstep fixes your bios.
Lil B follows 1.5 million people
The rap was the biggest fire.
YGS 300 CONFIRMED?!?

My mom likes calling jacksepticeye the Irish Dora The Explorer
All right guys know we know he's at least an hour away from Disneyland
When will you do a YIAY?
Heyyy
why no call me carson
That Roomie song took me by surprise for a moment, then I remembered that you had an appearance in the music video.
Look at this dude sponsored by a door bell üôÉ not sorry
So... did you get some trim?
First
4:23 me
What‚Äôs the question
What, you‚Äôre alive?
Jack,  instead of going to disneyland you should have gone to Animal Kingdom at Disney World so you could burn Avatar Land to the ground.
The mad lad, he only went and did it!
ths vid baad lol
Louder Markiplier definitely makes more sense than Irish/2nd Pewdiepie. LoL
Am I the only one who thinks Jack is actually a great lyric writer?
Mark ruffalo wants us to go green
what song at 5:24
It‚Äôs cute that Jack thinks I, a millenial and a Jacksfilms-subscriber, have a house where to add this neat Ring-doorbell. :)
ü§£
Sorry but, I already have ring üòé
He‚Äôs one of those celebs that‚Äôs too cool for twitter bios girl I wanna spoil you
DUBSTEP SOLVES EVERYTHING. WITH A DANCING THANOS GIF. THE BEST THING YOU'VE RELEASED IN YEARS.
Jack put himself in the peasant section
5:20
2:30 *remembers mortal engines...
You need to skip 9 and go directly to X
Loved that "DUBSTEP SOLVES EVERYTHING 3" callback. Very nice.
How much power does Tom Holland have
That Twice picture hahaha‚ô°
Nice callback
dubstep
1:28 Terrible, awful, no good, very bad day.
yeah jack is not second pewdiepie... hes third
he‚Äôs back
0:05
Yum
GOOD EPISODE YOU FINALLY LEARNED HOW TO FUNNY
I love this video
5:25
am i the only one who actually goes on twitter to see if any of the accounts changed their bios
Tom Holland doesn‚Äôt know when you die, they stopped giving him the details so he couldn‚Äôt spoil it.
Ring is a gay
5:23 what's this song called?
When are you getting yiay ?
the dubstep solves everything 3 music,,, we're still waiting for the fourth one u promised us jack,,,
Yee
‚ÄùAiryana Grande, ‚Äù I think that's Ariana Grande‚Äôs twin sister.
Was that last one an apology to Dolan Dark?
Finally
Dubstep solves everything 4 when?
Thanos dancing to DSE 3 was beautiful. Can we get like an hour long loop of that?
LOL
Poor toby
If there is going to be more Avatar movies, then they may do better than the first one and Endgame. :|
What song is this at 5:23
Am I the only one who's going to mention how great that rap was?
Louder Markiplier üòÇ
3:50
When u watch the ad because ur nice
hey @ everyone worrying abt the animators!!! yes its gonna be a lot of work but the majority of the movie is done for them, theyre just making a new model of sonic and loading it with the same motion data (the him moving part) to it. theyll have to tweak bits here and there since the original data was most likely made for the old model, but it wont be like restarting from scratch. still a looooot of work but not as bad as some people may think!!! :)
‚ÄúLouder markiplier‚Äù threw meüòÇ
Cheese
I want Jack to make a rap album so bad
You can't fix my bios because a bios is a basic input/output system and you would have to access my computer to fix it! You fool!
3:32 not spider man its spoiler man
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeing!!!!
#loudermarkiplier
Click here to see the previous episode
3:41
It actually isn't that hard to fix Sonic. They just gotta fix what they put over the frame for thw CGI. We shouldn't let misinformation like that stop us from correcting corporate mistakes
Yes, John, you do have a problem. This Avatar Endgame joke is not funny... they're going to win. They made $2,500,000,000 in like 19 days. Stop worrying, they've already won.
You know that most of your fans are 16 yo why do they need a smart doorbell
as a movie theater employee, please don‚Äôt see endgame anymore. the theater is taking away my social life
Keep in mind one of the boxes is a "yaaaaasssss" box.... Not even joking
5:23 is that og dubstep from you jack

Dubstep solves everything 4 confirmed
5:23
whats this song aaAA
I actually watched the ad at the end because I forgot this wasn't a YIAY for once and i couldn't be fucked to skip ahead.
I just wanna say that because of the way they animated, they don't need to completely reanimate sonic. All they need to do is remake the model, the way that style of animation works is it's like a doll on a rig, all they have to do is replace the doll. They don't have to redo everything; so, saying they would redo the God awful design of Sonic is completely reasonable.
It's not JackSepticEye it's JackSpedicy...  2
They probably won't let Tom Holland have a twitter bio so he doesn't spoil anything in it
The best part of this video is when he skips the person who asks to be skipped. It‚Äôs like 2 seconds and never revisited
!!! FINALLY !!!
Clearly you don‚Äôt follow Nickelodeon‚Äôs Twitter account if you think that all they tweet is Spongebob memes. They tweet WAY more than just that. They tweet about upcoming shows, upcoming seasons of their shows, stuff about their past shows, things for their films both old AND new and a lot of other shit that has to do with their content.
Nice vid! Nice vid! Nice vid! Nice vid!
1:16 Idk... I feel like the animators are fine. How much you wanna bet that Sonic's design was purposefully designed to be ugly for the previews and publicity, but the real, better design is already made...
What did you use for your teeth? They look great
He probably doesn‚Äôt have a bio so he doesn‚Äôt accidentally spoil anything
Lol
No one can be louder than mark
ü§†
my bios is outdated haha top funny 2013
it's baaaaaaack
i check their bios to see if they changed it
Not trying to brag or anything but I think I just had a vision that this video would be sponsored by ring and I‚Äôm just now realizing it.
...8?
My bios crashed, send help
Weeeee!
5:20 A New ‚ÄúDubstep Solves Everything‚Äù confirmed?

-Jacksfilms, 2015
Yo not gonna lie I bought a video door bell for the first time and it's cool as fuck. I went with the Nest stuff cuz I'm deep in the Google ecosystem, but Ring works great too.
Who the hell is airiana grande?
Why did know one say james Charles jack think of the views
Who‚Äôs here commenting before hank green does
I like to think that Jack is on the couch watching TV and Aaron while working her regular nine-to-five still has to talk to the people that come to the front door and be the adult.
so uh... 5:21... are we getting DUBSTEP SOLVES EVERYTHING 4 next?
U should have put .‚Äùi dont feel so good‚Äù as spidermans bio

Louder 2nd pewdiepie
Ring's mission is to make neighbourhoods safer. Too bad it can be easily hacked. Anyone who knows anything about cyber security will tell you: stay clear of the smart home crap.
Has he fixed Jenna's yet?
louder markiplier lmao
LOUDER MARKIPLIER x'D
When did this turn from fixing your bios to fixing random celebrities bios
5:50
He can acutally become a rapper with that voice
Please remember to take action against the climate crisis and the environmental breakdown today fellow humans. That way we won't see sonics face because we are going to be doing other things.
God please shut up about the record that shall not be named!
That‚Äôs why a lady crawled through my TV! It was your sponsor!
Oof
You want to be pewdiepie so much lol freak
Spider-man can climb walls and stuff, but Tom Holland knows exactly how and when you die

Goddamn you fooled me. I actually had to go and check if that was Ninja's bio. For a split second I thought he was cool in any way.


But nope.
1:32 video intros. let's a go!
Bro, we don't care about the bios, fix the pix!
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre still alive when avatar 5 comes out‚Äù sorry to flex but in 2027 I‚Äôm going to be 21 and thriving

‚ÄúAir-ee-ahna‚Äù
I feel like no one cares enough that he actually changed his bio to that
uh... meow?
HANK YOU HAVE TO LEGALLY CHANGE YOUR BIO NOW
Why was that rap kinda sick
Why is Ring getting John to sponsor them? All Jack fans are criminals
where is yiay?
Jacksepticeye can't be second PewDiePie, he doesn't constantly promote the alt-right
And who said Eminem is the only white guy that can rap?
I don‚Äôt really think this is funny. Not trying to start beef. Just don‚Äôt see the appeal
Fish is Thursday and tmorrow aka Friday meh bro and momma gonna see our big sisters doggone btw is is boy 6 weeks large for its age lazy sleepy and a husky

I watched the 1st 30 seconds on .25 speed..... i forgot i had that on amd i thought that was something jack would do.
Grandayy: you used me
He actually changed it. üòÇ that‚Äôs dedication, man.
For anyone wondering, Ninja's actual bio is just his business email and a link to his Twitch Channel
I went to his Twitter he did change it to that love the commitment
Fix James Charles's bio
Well this dude is clearly running out of ideas
Hey Jack, how about fixing you mic echo?
I already have Ring, Jack. Step up your game!
Ring is like the iPhone of doorbells
Jacksfilms is my only reason to live. Guess I‚Äôll die now
He loves his wife so much he calls Ariana ‚ÄúERiana‚Äù
Sup jack maybe you can do like an instagram page review
You can review your followers instagram of from celebrities

Oof
James Cameron's bio should read "I did the highest grossing movie of all time in 1997... and since twelve years later no one had been able to beat my record, I had to came back and do it myself. #LIKEABOSS #GoFuckYourselfJacksfilms #YoullNeverBeatMe #ThanosWho"
What you said about JSE is accurate af. Pewdiepie is trash, Mark and Jack are daddy.
Is YouTube auto subbing you guys? I got subbed to Ancient Reality, Game Theory, and Someone else I didn't ask for so far
5:24 What is this song?
AIRiana Grande lmfao
Jack: Ring, youve probably heard of them.

Us who have heard him have the same 3 sponsors for the past 10 years:
I can't believe they're redesigning Sonic, his old design was so epic
Do fix you flags 2
Like if he should do it
well dude idk about you in California but in my city but ninjas dont come through the door
Sonic, eh..
Here we go again

James charles
What are you gonna do for FIX YOUR TWITTER BIOS 100?
Tom Holland's made me scream
5:23 "dubstep solves everything" flashbacks
Jack is that you? It's been so long I thought passed in the Freeze of 2050.
im sad bc I just found out thats not actually ninjas bio
y'all i didn't even know mark ruffalo was hulk, i only thought of him as the dude from  13 going on 30
5:13 YEET MORE NEW ZEALAND PEPS IN HERE
Grandayyy gonna be mad he was used for a sponsor Segway
DO ANOTHER YIAY
5:23 Remember Dubstep Solves Everything
you would know burnout, jack
Haven't heard Look Me in the Eye in a while lol
3:37 well actually he doesn't know how to use Twitter so that's probably why.
Fix Jacksfilms bio
"Tom Holland knows exactly how and when you die"

terrifying, I love it
I THOUGHT THIS WAS FORTNITE FUNNIES......
i can't believe you ignored the bk yaaaas meal
I love how he actually changed his
Bio
I'm only on season 5 episode 15 of 2019!
big echo intensifies
Oh God, did Jack just make an EFAP meme with spiders seeing the future? Rhino milk to everyone if that's the case ü•õü¶è
Yes I also like the ring. You were talking about the movie right?
I forgot about won't back down, thanks for reminding me!
Jack is actually pretty good with rapping
Be a klondike i thought of beat a klondike
Who checked jacks bio after
if you check, he actually changed his bio to that
You can fix the bios, but you can't fix twitter.
Stfu they announced a new Rick and Morty season
sometimes I think the ads are too long... but I know the funnyman needs to sell me things to live
Change you dang Twitter banner
1:47 song??
I came 1 hour after posted
You should fix your audio next time!
Jack actually changed his bio lol
Jack's bio says nothing about Endgame.  You committed or not, chief?
The Sonic the Hedgehog twitter has more followers than Tom Holland. I enjoy that.
Finally a video
i love this series!
You forgot to say "yesterday I asked you"
re upload?
5:24 oh shit this brings back memories
The guy also does Aliens and Avatar, so he probably doesn't know what he's doing
I was really hoping you changed Ariana grandes to thank you ness
Watching your vids now are just like watching teleshopping
Put #WatchEndgame #BeatAvatar in your bio
Oh, Jack. Your bio is not the worst. #Starbucks

You didn't fix Carson's bio!!!!!!!!!!
It's been a long time since I've heard Won't Back Down. That was nice.
dubstep solves everything
Excellent usage of your own song again bro
"Loyal"

What was that song that plays when he changed the bio to " I have no life"?
Avatar is better
All this video did was make me want a DUBSTEP SOLVES EVERYTHING 4.
Jack stop calling Erin "your wife" like tf man its 2012
I do hope Avengers passes Avatar soon but you cant deny the fact that Avatar is the best grossing movie considering it didnt have like 20 movies before it. It just came out of no where and became number one
Raping vs Rapping one is a form of music another‚Äôs a freaking crime
Oh damn... He is Louder Markiplier
He's so boring
Considering that Martin has four followers, I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs asking
üñïüèø

You should have done Ariana's last and made some kinda pun with the Ring.

Hehe chaeyoung 2:14
Ah, this video seemed a bit too normal for a second
He actually left the ACTUAL script in the description
For a second I thought we'd actually have a normal video for once. Really dodged a bullet there.
Every subsequent version of Jack was getting more sweaty than the last.
Damn the MCU is getting good with their ads
jack i will watch endgame for the 13th time, just please give me back my family
I feel like the second half of the video is missing. How will I know which VPN I totally need now?
This went from 0 to 100000000000 real quick
Has anyone realized that his armpits are really sweaty lol
Thanos doing Fortnite dances definitely convinced me to see Endgame for the 172nd time, thanks John.
jack i will watch endgame for the 13th time, just please give me back my family
Respect to Jack for actually explaining his problems with Season 8, instead of "D&D hahaha"
I never thought you could laugh and cry at the same time
2018: Pewdiepie vs T series 
2019: Endgame vs Avatar
Endgame: exists
Titanic: "Avatar, I don't feel so good...
Don‚Äôt even watch GoT and still clicked lol
Endgame was really good but the part where Thanos started to eat lasagna in front of Tony is kinda weird right?
Everyone including me: what the hell is this?

An intellectual: obviosuly this is spoiling the end of got where the thronegers have to go back in time and stop the mad queen from collecting all six infinity dragons and reducing kings landing to ashes.
When you block out in class, and the teacher is on a completely different subject.
Every new Jack that entered was slightly more sweaty, nice
I like that each Jack clone got progressively more sweaty
Sweet! Jack has hit the success level where you do a bunch of crack and have a melt down. Looking forward to it! üòÄ
Before this I really didn‚Äôt understand game of thrones... thanks for the explanation
"Stay tuned for more game of thrones updates, only on Disney" I LAUGHED SO HARD
Was wondering why this appeared in my recommended considering I‚Äôve never watched GOT. Now I know why. Once again thank you recommendations.
jack i will watch endgame for the 13th time, just please give me back my family
How to get in trending; 

1. Game of Thrones in the title
2. thats it fam
I was actually expecting to hear why... turns out I had to read the description while being yelled at to watch endgame.
Loving this better quality content he's been working on. the Q U A L I T Y
Could we get a serious breakdown on game of thrones for the people who used to love the show, or are YOU GONNA TALK OVER YOURSELF THE WHOLE TIME. . .THANK YOU
I‚Äôm changing what the comment says so the replies don‚Äôt make any sense lol




üëågottem
The song in the background is Can't Hold Us by Macklemore
Good job on tricking the system, Jack, you evil genius. #WatchEndgame #BeatAvatar
thats how you use the description box! for real the problem isnt that dany went mad queen its that she went mad queen on a bunch of innocent bystanding people who she has been a champion for her entire story. rip dany we love you (seasons 1 - season 8 episode 5)
shouldn't have expected anything from this video tbh

my bad
My last 4 braincells during exam.
Hey dude. Wheres your frame by frame analysis for shrek 5's trailer. You promised. Its been out for like 5 months now. Get on it. 






Nah jk do what you wanna with your life
People don't like GOT story because people have a hard time confronting their own nature and their own inevitable death.
Oh rip nobody's seen G.O.T.? 








Me too.
You make a very compelling point but I gotta disagree with you at
2:15
Thank you Jack. I‚Äôve never seen got but you fully explained to me all the intricate lore in a very easy to digest manner. Very Coool
Why haven't you talked about Sonic.
Blink twice if sanic is holding you hostage. Do you need help?
I'd like to make a petition for Alexander Hamilton 4! Please Jack!
Why? Because we expected a rivalry epic to Endgame.

Instead we got Green Lantern: Dumb & Dumber Edition.
They had us in the first half... not gonna lie :3
I almost missed it but from 0:30 to the end of the video he subtly tries to get people to watch Endgame
This is Anti-ASMR.
I wonder what movie I should watch... Oh i know... Detective Pikachu
I‚Äôm not mad at all.
Never watched it once.
If I do end up going to see Endgame, this video will be the ONLY reason I do so
As someone who‚Äôs never watched game of thrones I‚Äôd say this is accurate
This is the best GoT breakdown I have ever witnessed.
0:00

the final season of Game of Thrones and

00:02

in particular the last three episodes



have really angered and divided fans but



why well there are a couple of reasons



for this so let's break down the biggest



and most recent problem Daenerys in last



night's episode Daenerys and drogon



rained fire upon King's Landing killing



thousands of innocents and remember this



is after Circe's armies already



surrendered to her now the writers of



the show



then you gotta decide against James



Cameron Cameron



[Music]



to summarize everything we really only



have one episode left and frankly I'm



excited to see how it all plays out



thanks for watching and stay tuned for



more Game of Thrones updates only on



Disney hey just
The show has been getting worse since season 5. Season 4 was arguably the last great season.
Can you make a real video?
My favorite Jack is the one dancing throughout the whole video
Ive never watched Game Of Throne and Im not gonna start doing , but this is interesting
Macklemore in the background üòç
I've seen it twice, so chill, dude.

...but yeah, classic Jacksfilms. :)
psssstt....
Hey....



DID YOU SEE ENDGAME YET?
Today's fact: In Japan, you are equally likely to die from being struck by lightning as you are from being shot by a gun.
Don't care about GOT. Don't plan to see Endgame more than the one time I have. I'm excited about GODZILLA: KING OF THE MUTHAFUCKIN' MONSTERS.
The real question is, Jack, how many times have YOU seen Endgame?
Wait YouTube is putting good content on YouTube trending?
How did he rip the paper in half soo perfectly
The obvious problem is the exact same as The Last Jedi... Time vested for no payoff...

Crappola is always crappola
we're about to make your end game wish come true, my whole school is gonna see it this week
jerk ü§¨ i thought it was a normal video
Ok, but Jack, did YOU see Endgame yet?
1:24 I especially liked that subtle but good point
Thanos breakdancing?!! AWESOME SAUCE!
I haven't even seen Infitity War let me breathe Jack
Having recently gone back and watched every season leading up to season 8 in preparation I must say that there are a lot of hints in the show alone. I kind of always had a feeling she would eventually do this period she's always fought against her worst impulses and even wanting to do the same thing after she returned from the dothraki capital.  In the books there's a lot more lead up to it. I do agree that there should have been a little more time given to show her descent but as I stated having watched the previous seasons There are a lot of clues that this was going to happen. I think even with Brans Vision that he had of a dragon flying over king's landing, I had a feeling at that moment that's what she was there to do. I've enjoyed the season for the most part but I do agree that if the season should have at least been 8 episodes if not 10 to finish everything up
I can't watch Endgame...... 







I'm waiting till marriage.
My favorite is the random dancing Jack on the right in the back
first video i see of this guy. Im not subbing
Who else saw the pit stains xD
Clearest shot- 1:04
hey can you turn my ad blocker back on I can‚Äôt hear the video.............
I was really wondering about all of the hate about that episode, thanks jack.
Too much symbolism.. as a person who hasn‚Äôt seen any marvel movie I just don‚Äôt understand ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hey, dyo see endgame yet?
Are people mad at GOT?? I didnt know.
FInally... I GOT the quality content I subscribed for.
How it feels when you're watching YouTube and ads pop up
It took me 3 times of watching this to get to the the punchline because I was so disinterested
Endgame has a major disadvantage because I am pretty sure illegal stream is now way more popular and easier available than to the times of Avatar.
Also I didn't watch it.
Adjusted for inflation Endgame actually needs $3,273,000,000 to beat Avatar.
And then it would still be behind Gone with the Wind.
Hm... I suddenly feel like watching Endgame for some reason... ü§îü§îü§îü§î
This is what I see after I wake up from sleep paralysis
Never raps any more
Alexander Hamil-4
I'm gonna start every conversation with "Hey, did you see Endgame yet?" until it passes Avatar.
I can't watch endgame. It has too many spoilers for Endgame.
He.. he looks so tired. I would ask if he is okay.... but I don't want to assume he is not....
I‚Äôve already got 4 kidney stones from watching Endgame 17 times.

At first I though this was an actual video 





Man was I wrong
I had manage to decode what was Jack was saying about game of thrones
The sweat stains really show how hard he went recording this. Good job Jackaboy
Endgame>Avatar I love you 3000‚ô•Ô∏èüò≠
Jokes on you, I love Can't Hold Us and Endgame!
Good Criticism ! Now i understand why there is so much backlash. Good video Jack
You should rally everyone around the world to watch the movie ONE LAST TIME, if the whole world is involved...Bam! Avatar's gone! (Dab)
Imagine this at your school talent show
Night King would be a better king!!
This reminds of being in a toxic discord channel
The real script is in the description, just in case you thought you were click baited.
He had us in the first half , not gonna lie
I am mad because it took them 7 seasons to ruin this masterpiece.
I only stopped by to say this:

So I was watching one punch man and that face on the thumbnail would be the perfect depiction of real life sour face.
I already saw this but with the green screen on jackisanerd üò§üò§üò§üò§
endgame was meh




Someone needed to say it
Can't wait for the Watch Endgame Beat Avatar merch I SEE YOU
oh yes, the quality content i subscribed for üëåüèª
When you're also subbed to jackisanerd so you're just bamboozled with this.
We're in the real endgame now

lol that thanos dancing cracked me up
I laughed my ass out seeing the thumbnail of the vid.
Jack's editing is always incredible. Honestly, the editing alone is some of the funniest shit he makes. Also, D'JYA SEE ENGAME YET???
Think how weird it must be to watch this video out of context
Soon, Avengers:Endgame will be the most paid movie in the world

Good job jack you broke my sanity
This really upset me

This is the quality content I subscribed for.
After watching this...






My ears rung.
he literally had a negative subscriber growth on social blade
Wow, this is actually a serious video 
0:28 nevermind
I agree with what you said in the description. Instead of blind anger and rushed insults you actually took the time to explain the problems and I agree with you. Thank you for being slightly positive
I saw endgame twice 
let me enjoy my GOT I did my part.
where's YIAY ? Did you add protein to it?
I agree with everything you said in the description.
No. I have not seen Endgame yet. I might watch it on Netflix but I already know what happens and the genre does not particularly interest me.
Honestly the tiny dancing Thanos really made ...the episode of GOT... perfect
My brain cells after seeing endgame and bragging to my friends coz I watched it super early.
This video (+ description) is amazing because it displays Jack's nerdiness as well as the fact that he loves to turn ANYTHING into a joke
And they say Witcher 3 is the Game of Thrones of video games? F#Ck that! That game was a masterpiece! Screw GOT!
he gets progressively sweaty and it creeps me out lmao
Honestly a new perspective for Game of Thrones. I‚Äôll keep your point of view in mind as I watch next weeks episode. Really got me thinking
I agree with you on the part about the dragons.
This is the perfect clusterfuck.

Thank you
You should live stream endgame beating avatar
Thank you mackelmore
Game Of Thrones has neither Fortnite or Dabbing, it‚Äôs obvious that it never stood a chance against Endgame. #WatchEndgame

Mr. Jack I don't feel so good.
For some reason I really want to go watch Detective Pikachu...
i can never figure out if Jack is being sarcastic or not
I agree with the description

I agree, Daenerys had every right.

Some youtubers try to ride drama, politics, or tragedy to success. But Jack? he's all about Shrek, The Emoji Movie, and Avatar.
Never change Jack, never change.
Who else still heard jack on GoT
damn john why are you sweating so much.
But make sure to watch Captain Marvel beforehand. It's very important for Endgame
No, I haven't seen Endgame yet. Thanks for the reminder
Good video, but for some reason, I have a sudden urge to see Endgame again
This is without a doubt the most chaotic 1:49 mins I‚Äôve ever experienced
Hey, you seen endgame yet?!?!
I think he perfectly described season 8 chaotic n all trash noise n nonsense.
I already met my cry in public once a year quota the first time I saw Endgame, think I'll be catching in sweet 4k stoned from the comfort of home for my next teary eyed run through üò≠
Ah yes. I completely agree with your opinion on GoT
Imaging if endgame bits avatar only to be instantly bitten by Detective Pikachu.
To put it simply, because it doesnt make any sense
I‚Äôm on my way to watch endgame for the 4th time
Lol I literally just bought endgame IMAX tickets less than an hour ago, and then I clicked on this vid 


Thx Jack. (most of us won't admit this, but we love you m8)

HEY DID YA SEE ENDGAME YET??!
Endgame > game of thrones
I am actually happy by an clickbait
This man's a genius .
Alright. Alright. I'll go Avatar. Where do you keep your time machine again?
i get jumpscared every time he says ‚Äúdid you see endgame yet‚Äù like wtf
I will... never go see endgame.
i was enjoying the serious explanation until all the pop ups, bad joke imo
For anyone interested in the game of thrones part‚Äîthe full speech is in the description
I actually haven‚Äôt seen avatar 
Is it good?
dammit, jack. i actually wanted to know
I've read the descritpion and my answer to that is yes





Ive seen Endgame
Hope you guys had your notebooks, cause I wrote everything he just said. 
He said:
Somebody destroyed a kingdom

The people surrender

Have you watch endgame

"Can't hold us" Playing

Shows how much money Endgame made and how much Avatar made

I've just watched 13 times

Endgame, Avatar, Endgame, Avatar, Endgame, Avatar, Endgame, Avatar



Thanos starts dancing

Let's talk about James Carey
Here is a good reason why you should watch Endgame

Detective Pikachu is out in theaters but you can see it later

And there is one more episode left.

Watch GOT on Disney Chan-
i can't place that song
It's been a long time since you did a Endgame video. Please do one. Thanks.
Why yes, I have seen Endgame already. Thanks for asking.
Jacks big project everybody^
Endgame, game of thrones, avatar,  Macklemore, and detective pikachu




THIS is the most ambitious crossover
I don't even watch game of thrones but I clicked out of curiosity. I'm not mad that I did. Lol yes I saw Endgame.
I don't wanna see endgame, but i might buy a ticket, just so it can beat Avatar
you see endgame yet?
The secret project that took you all this time to do. I think the quick question was better though
I get a feeling he wants us to watch Avatar
"Why are people so mad at Game of Thrones" maybe people finally realized that it munches butt
This was a work of art, now go see endgame
always a pleasure :)
The outrageous love for this I can‚Äôt understand
This video gave me 10 migraines and possibly 5 tumours at the same time 


11/10 would love to get again!
Wait how tf did he tear that paper perfectly
Just think about how much time he took to make this video. He got so sweaty at the end lmao
So, will we get to find out why people are mad at game of thrones after Endgame beats avatar
I dont even watch GoT wth am I doing here
So I just watched the newest Game of Thrones episode and the sheer perfection, the unmitigated brilliance of it blew me away. Not since 2007's Beowulf has a team of writers taken a complete masterpiece in its own right and then proceeded to produce such a brilliant coup de grace. To be so consistent with and yet top the material: the logical consistency, the relationship nuances, the tactical minutia. Truly I don't even have sufficient words at my disposal to describe such a feat. I am completely spellbound by the transcendent experience of those 90 minutes.

MY THEORY: The writers set out to produce something so unilaterally hated by all that it unifies everyone in the world, no matter their differences. Either that or they gave a pack of feral 6 year olds a toy castle and action figures and wrote an episode based on the wildlings play.
I think I just had a seizure
I-I-I wanted to hear what you had to say about GoT ;-_-;
HEY HAVE YOU SEEN ENDGAME YET
Did anyone see the Starbucks coffee cup in endgame. So unprofessional
Hey.. has anyone seen.. Bruno  great movie
Because they destroyed a show I grew up with with traumatically bad writing :(
I just love the thumbnail..
Thanos should snap out 50%of Jacks in this video
The Avengers would have saved King's Landing.
You should have to try Niel Cicierega's style of sorting this messy audio by putting things on the left ear or on the right.

That was just hell.
Detective Pikachu deserves number 1 tho
Is that the guy who cough several time in row and became viral?
This is the big project he was working on guys
hey did you see endgame yet?
Instructions unclear, watched Avatar.
This made my head go nuts but in a good way
Exactly. Endgame needs 300 million more boys
Wow Jack I can‚Äôt believe you finally released the big project! Amazing video and amazing job üëçüèº
Why attacking Emilia Clarke's natural smile with that thumbnail though
I always knew it would end like this ever since season 5 aired. It already sucked then.
Ig I'm watching endgame again
Okay yall I live in NYC if anyone wants to make a pact with me to go see endgame as many times as possible I'm down. We gotta start funds tho cause I'm broke
Oh geez the second Jack popping up really startled me
Honestly, I appreciate this
I wanted to dislike this on principle but the description rant made me forgive you.
First of all avatar deserves to make more than endgame because endgame was actually really bad
i‚Äôve been B A M B O O Z L E E D
If you guys curious what he was actually saying, its in the description üòÇ
Jack is youtube's Tucker Carlson
It all feels way to rushed and so Anti-Climatic and cliche to say the least!!!!!! Why Oh WHY!!!!!
This is the best thumbnail in existence
Oh wow I'm so convinced. I've got to see Endgame now!


Funny thing is I'm actually going to see it in 3 hours.
Damn he was serious for a whole minute I was so worried
I still haven't watched it.
if you have to ask you havnt been watching or read the novels
Thank you for the schizophrenia.
They just don't like dragons...
Personally I like my dragons in maid outfits
b-but, I like Avatar
Just a 1:49 ad about endgame perfect content
this is just an EndGame‚Ñ¢ advert sponsored by EndGame‚Ñ¢
Lmao yeah it has to end somehow, they're doing a good job finishing it out I think
Please don't cut your beard, let them grow
I love how the first Jack's are ok, but then they all become sweaty and wet
Endgame escalated quickly
LMAO HE IS SWEATING!
1:01 let‚Äôs just appreciate that perfect rip.
But Disney owns endgame and avatar
The new rickroll ladies and germs.
Endgame spolier





Avatar dies
Very informative. Thank you Jack.
This was an excellent review, Jack, sir. But as someone who hasn‚Äôt watched a single episode of GOT, I only wished to know your thoughts on Detective Pikachu
I guess you could call this season the show's... Endgame
Whose hyped for the sad XXX film and Gekyume origin story set for the MCU?
Jaime didn't get a story arc, he got a story circle.

But: I agree that this season feels rushed. But Dany's madness has been there all along. And now she's lost everyone she cared about. It's no wonder she snapped. Alright, now back to endgame.
Big 4head boy attacks GoT 2019
When you see the second Jacksfilms in the back and wonder how akward he must of looked. I'm dying laughing Edit my grammar is perfect and thanks for the likes its the most I've ever gotten
I‚Äôve seen it twice and also this is accurate
no one:
schizophrenia:
10/10 for this wonderful video.
There's a 99% chance this was copyright claimed by, if I'm guessing, I'd say Sony.
Oh wow I'm so glad the Harlem Shake has made a comeback
This is why I subscribed
hey this music is really nice!! great job putting in macklemore‚Äôs music!
this is legit how my nightmares feel like
Same reason I want crack your cheeks.  Wasn't hugged enough
John can you please remake this with a green screen so we can endgame-roll people
Jack with the hat looks like the gmod character who's getting diddled by shrek
Frick you you fricking frick I wanted to hear about game of fricking thrones you fricking frick
Frick you you fricking frick I wanted to hear about game of fricking thrones you fricking frick
Why is that Macklemore song in the background
"I'm taking time to focus on making higher quality content."
Thanks for your analysis on why people are angry at game of thrones
Jack did you see endgame yet?
I love you jacksfilms.
You‚Äôre right! I do need to watch Avatar again.
I love how you actually broke it down in the description. Dedication right there.
Yo, can I get the pop up "did you see Endgame yet" as a green screen meme?
I don't even watch game of thrones... so glad i clicked on this video
Quality content.
i actually agree with the description VERY strongly
Congratulations! You found the most recent comment in the ocean of 5.4k comments!
HEY DID YOU SEEN ENDGAME YET
this is what crazy people hear before they go to sleep
I have been thinking of seeing Endgame again, I saw it 3 times so far.
Thanks For Watching Jacksfilms
Only On Disney
#endgame
Same reason people were mad about the last jedi - their fanfics didnt play out the way they imagined it. I wouldn't worry about them
This is my alarm and my ringtone.
Because it keeps popping up on the HBO Channle on my TV
This is how my constant internal monologue sounds
I think he might want us to watch endgame but I‚Äôm not sure. He‚Äôs really subtle about it.
because it keeps begging me to play the game even tho i don't like that kind of genre
HEY HAVE YOU SEEN ENDGAME YET?!
1 min wasted
yea make sure to cover your forehead with that hat.
Nobody: 
Not a single soul:






Jack: 
I was really scared till 0:29
Jakesfilms is still relevant?

Sorry just haven‚Äôt seen your videos in like 2 years
My mind when someone ask me a question.
tell me the redemption arc failed after describing the shape of an arc.
And then thanos snapped the jacks out of existence.
This energy, but in telling people to go vote
My heart is racing
No spoiler warning lol I love this
Cuz no one give a fluck about tv shows.
Oh hell yeah! I had a feeling that this video wouldn't disappoint me.
I like how there's an actual answer in the description
Anyone notice the little robot guy dancing to BTS? ü§£ü§£
I have literally never watched Game Of Thrones
I've never watched a single episode of Game of Thrones.
Me watching Got on 123 movies and all the random ad‚Äôs start popping up
I've just got an ad for Game of Thrones :)
im getting a subtle feeling to go see endgame, weird.
Actually gonna watch endgame again just because of this
Someone give me the lyrics
best. clickbait. ever






hands down
I wonder if I should watch end gameüí≠
Avatar 2 Will Come Out Eventually
Jack,







I haven't watched Endgame
Clickbait im not mad about
9/10 episode break down. Lost a point for not mentioning Endgame
I have seen endgame 6 times
Thank you for explaining!
Thanks, just thanks man. I needed this
This is me on broccoli.
is no one gonna talk about Jack in that thumbnail?
I actually clicked off the video because of my attention span of 0:26 seconds
I really enjoy your sweaty hair
If you really want to know what he thinks about GoT season 8. Just read the description.
0:29 if you don‚Äôt care about GOT.
Hey is this jackskepticeye?
didnt realize i clicked on a jacksepticeye vid
Lads, I just found out that I'm 5% Irish!

No, I have not seen endgame yet
ENDGAME!!!!! GET OUTTA HERE GoT AND AVATAR!!!!!
End Game of Thrones.
Jack, why do you think you can start a movement?
You just couldn't resist saying "Only on Disney", could you?
Am I the only one that noticed thanos was doing Bts choreography
Did I just get Rick Rolled in 2019
I already did Jack....
i put it on i detective pikachu video- GO WATCH ENDGAME
I'm watching endgame today...
You should make a video about Endgame.
Never seen endgame
Only watched the first episode of GoT
Still watched this video to the end
Absolute quality content
Game of thrones is really stupid in my eyes, change my mind
That was very accurate lol
Props to Jack for dancing that long in the back right
LOL. This is what im talking about
I wish this went on for 10 minutes
Is this an endgame ad? I'm confused
Rose are red
Violets are blue
Not mad, just disappointed... 

...in people for validating the existence of the box office. Let it rot with its vapid blue people movie on top. End the timed exclusivity of movies...

...so yeah, once they exhausted actual well-written material sourced from the novels, the characters all became cardboard and events started happening to elicit a reaction from the audience instead of developing organically.
Quality shitposting.
I think I might buy avatar on dvd
If you're filming and editing videos, you're not watching Endgame (I'm in theater rn, watchin' Endgame)
I was disappointed because I don‚Äôt watch game of thrones, but was pleasantly surprised by the plot twist. 
In conclusion:
A surprise for sure but a welcome one
I lost it at his very last joke.
Im so glad I watched this
Phewh, I thought you were actually gonna talk about GOT
When it comes to technical terms: Shrek 4 is objectively a better movie than Avengers: Endgame.

 The reason is, is that Shrek 4 and Avengers: Endgame both do a deep dive into the realms of time travel.
Avengers Endgame states that "Changing the past does not change the present/future, but it instead creates a new timeline...this is incorrect due to the fact that wouldn't these timelines eventually collide? Endgame also brings up the question, all of these other timelines are screwed, with one timeline not forming the Guardians of the Galaxy, which by default will destroy all life in that universe, due to Ego (Starlord's planet space dad) making the virus that he wanted to "spread his seed" killing all life in that timeline's universe. So that brings up my argument, the Endgame timeline Avengers are kinda dicks to the other timelines, I thought they were supposed to be the good guys, I guess not, bad movie get out of here.


Shrek 4 on the other hand sends Shrek to the past, as a punishment, Shrek makes it his best effort not to mess with the past at all because just like Hottub time-machine and back to the future have stated, "messing with the past will result in your present/future changing forever" this is the correct way on how time travel works because back to the future said so. Rumpletilskinz the antagonist of Shrek 4 sends Shrek to the past but fills it with people Shrek has known throughout his life, such as his wife, Fiona. At the end of Shrek 2, Shrek is announced as a hero of far far away and is no longer harrassed on the streets because of him being an ogre, this is extremely important to Shrek 4's ot because Rumplestiltskin   sending Shrek to the past has put Shrek into his own personal hell, a world that doesn't need or like Shrek. Shrek takes quick action to realize that to get out of this world he doesn't need to build a time machine, he needs to do one of his hardest struggles all over again, fall in love with Fiona. Shrek finally gets Fiona to love him and breaks the curse, sending him back into the present, and Rumplestiltskin stays in the past to rot, all is well, and Shrek and Fiona can live, happily forever after.
I‚Äôm glad I took my chances and watched this video even though I don‚Äôt watch GOT
I will pay the guy who writes down everything what Jack said $10
Jack, change shirts. You look super sweaty.
I'm sorry April Fools was last month you're kinda late
endgame was only worth seeing once.
best part is how many video tracks jack had to have while editing this
Winter is coming!
Winter is coming!
Winter is coming!
Winter is coming!

Nevermind!
is this the best video on youtube? n... yes
Huge project jack, huge
hey juicy endgame yeah?

I have not seen Endgame yet
I haven't watched endgame, never will and you can't make me

This thoughtful expose needs more Michael Keaton.
What‚Äôs sad is probably that avatar 2 will beat endgame üò≠
Jack I swear to god if this was your secret project, I'm going to riot.
Hey! Did'ja see endgame yet?
This is live footage of all my moods kicking in at 3am
no one: 
geeks/nerds:
10 out of 10 thumbnail.
I choke-laughed.
Idk why this guy triggers me but his voice and face is a yikes.
Ended up having to split seeing it between two sittings so there's two tickets I guess
congrats on 18th on trending!
Gotta love those sweat stains
Good to see you exercising John
Endgame watch it
He actually put the whole reason in the description lool
This made me go into sensory shut down so like. Good video.
Don't stand up for James....
Amazing perspective I never thought of it like that!
I hated every second of end game lol
endgame vs avatar is the new pewdiepie vs t-series
this is what I think my dreams are like
If everybody who viewed this watched it one more time in theaters we can pass Avatar üòÇ
HEY DID YOU SEE ENDGAME YET!?
Whoa, is this why everyone got extra pissed off about that Projared guy and that "Hey, sisters!" guy? Like the Games of Thrones ending being a failure causes people to want to see heads to roll and that causes all the gossip videos about youtubers to succeed.


I'm glad I never cared about GoT enough to be that salty over it and I could be on the outside to form this theory about how YouTube video popularity works.
If you feel sorry for the people of King's Landing, just remember they all rooted for the execution of Ned Stark
New meme good
I thought this was a real GOT video, what a fool i was....üòÇ
And that's how you know that the book is better than the movie. Because they didn't have the book to base their ending of while most of the saga it is pretty fair to the books and makes changes only when it's needed. The original author will sure give it a proper and more exciting ending
We don't wanna see another GoT video, do one about endgame
No noobmaster69 no chance against endgame
ps. this is an ad for endgame
I rarely ever dislike a video
Ohh so thats why people hate Game of Thrones
The writing for this season is complete TRASH.
should i go see endgame?
People who have never watched GoT be like, üòé???

Damn it, Jack. I was legitimately interested...
thanks for spoilers jack
Why are people so mad at jacksfilms?
This video
Coming soon: the annoying responses to "no i haven't seen endgame." and "i don't want to see endgame. "
I loved this review, it really hit all the points in the new season that have bothered me. So strange though, I feel like I should go watch Endgame now...
Thanks bringing it back to what truly matters. Idk if you're being sarcastic and you don't like avengers but I'm hoping the message behind the joke is sincere. #beatavatar
Watch Endgame.

I read this as Game of Thanos. Since a lot of people died it in, I agreed with myself.
I read the title as ‚ÄúWhy are pedophiles so mad at Game of Thrones‚Äù
he left the game of thrones script in the bio so if you are looking for a real game of thrones video just read.
Thanks for clearing things up

Hey did you see endgame yet?

This is what your greeted with at the gates of hell
Havent watched the latest episode and he just spoiled it instantly lol
I read the description first and almost thought it was gonna be a serious video for the first 20 seconds or so.......
Endgame was not that good, sorry.
why because game of thrones is gay
I‚Äôve loved it.
I'm happy I read the description for once
QUALITY CONTENT
i love the thumbnailllll
The caption generator gave up on life when he popped up in the blue shirt.
This made me so anxious
Rip for the people who actually thought this was about GOT
Fine I‚Äôll watch endgame only if fortnite is not in it
I haven‚Äôt watched a Jacksfilms vid in a while and I regret ever stopping.

I imagine this is what hell is like.
Weird flex but ok....
Go read the description
Watch DC's Doom Patrol
8 years,  winter is coming. White walkers are the death of.... oh... they died in 1 battle because arya learned to fly without wings. 
 Ok Cersei is a bad ass and the battle in king's landing is going to be epi..... oh, killed by a falling brick. 
Jaime has been redeeming himself for 5 years, busts brienne, then runs back to die from a falling brick, undoing his entire character arc. 
 Dany is the champion of the people, until out of nowhere, she kills everyone. 
 Jon does nothing all season.
   It's just bs. The writers are awful. 
 Dany should have been building up to mad queen status since middle of last season. 
 D&D don't give a fuck. They've made their money, they are writing new movies (star wars lmfao) and thrones is just in the way.
As a Game of Thrones fan, I can confirm this is very accurate.
I genuinely hate how your green screen looks better than the one on the show.
READ THE DESCRIPTION!
I actually really appreciate that you put ... the actual video in the description
0:08 i was expecting a "that's why, yesterday i asked you"
Didn't expect a Dude Perfect video from Jack
why , just why
bamboozled again

I sensed some subliminal messages

HEY DID YOU SEE ENDGAME YET???!!!
Yo Endgame was boooooring
Hey endgame is the movie with the purple guy from fortnite right?
I feel like im watching 1k jack's films intro's played at the same time.
I understand that this is not serious video, but
Arguments presented in the desccription are total garbage. There are no black and white characters in GoT, most of their actions are based on long character development process. We could see how Dany has been changing due to all tragic events in the past episodes, and how the anger for Cersei and other rulers of Seven Kingdoms  builds up. Shemany times reminded that her main goal is to destroy the ones who took the throne from her, and what she did in the last episode was the climax of her rage and this craving.
Same goes for other characters, GoT was not meant to be just another regular Hollywood show, where the good guys always beat the bad ones and everything is done to please the audience. It takes more realisctic approach at showing characters and their personalities. That always was and still is the biggest advantage of the show.
If someone preffers regular action/fantasy shows, GoT is simply not for them.
(but ok, battle of winterfell from ep.3 was just very bad both in script and execution)
This is it, this is the quality content I subscribed for
dude calm down
Did you actually see end game yet ?
See, I‚Äôm probably like the 1% of smart people who don‚Äôt watch game of thrones
Watch Detective Pikachu
geek culture unhinged
Man, game of thrones kind of makes me want to see endgame again, have you seen that yet?
This is basically how memes from Grandayy appear on your screen and how some memes overlap one another to make an even bigger meme!,Lol!
I never wanted this video to end
What drug(s) is this dude on
1:24 ‚Äúmay I remind you that endgame has been in theatres for three whole weekends and guess what it has grossed more money on its third weekend than detective pikachu grossed on its first weekend‚Äù
nightmare fuel
Watching this and I can only think about managing all the audio levels in editing. Well done, sir.
Its good. But wish it was a little longer.
Put this over all ur videos for the next month pls
If you haven‚Äôt seen Endgame yet... are you even human?
Jack you have a problem
You said some verry oppiniative stuff about game of thrones
Who else hates Marvel Movies & Game of Thrones? üòÄ
I liked how Dany burnt it all. Her beheaded friend told her too. I saw Endgame in IMAX. Which isn't true IMAX.
Never seen it, don't want to!
John is such a shitposter.
This is the content I subbed for
They had to reduce the budget for the first episodes by making it super dark to hide imperfections/cheap CGI then use the good CGI for the battle.  The dark hard to see episodes make it worse then the actual Daenerys change of plans/plot.  If you look at history and them repeating the mad king phrase over and over, her turning that way was to be expected.
This sunday im contributing for Endgame overpassing Avatar. Going for 2nd time in so called "theater" to give my measly i think it would be 2,5$ when converted, but hey. every penny counts.


First time i wathed free on the internet lol get rekt disney

All these people in the comments salty because it wasn‚Äôt a real analysis
am i the only one who has no idea or watched game of thrones.
lol I clicked this expecting a joke. then you were actually talking about game of thrones so I was kind of disappointed. let's just say I'm not disappointed any more
I learned a lot about Game Of Thrones from this video
Because they finally realised how bad this series is compred tobthe books. End of debate.
last game of thrones episode should be pretty good but ive been watching this show and different movies and no one even cared to ask if ive seen end game.
Pure gold.
I think he wants us to watch Avatar.
They made it 3D and it ruined it
There was a Game of Thrones ad before this video
This was a hot mess and u love it
I took a walk the night i saw the ice king die like a flower be stepped on by child. I wonder why such things must come to this?...... I realise then that, the writers for "wolverine origins" are the same writers for this last season, why be in sorrow? 
When the real villains of Game of Thrones were always the writers!üò±
not sure what it is, but something tells me he's a big endgame fan
This is such a good video because nobody cares about game of thrones
wow i got a game of thrones game's ad
What..? I-
0:27 no spoilers to get the best part
pretty sure i heard a "hail Satan." in there
This sums up a lot of my problems with GoT, thanks John.
When I watched the video the first time I stopped watching right before he starts talking about Endgame but no that I've watched the whole video I realized that I missed out on a lot
This is art itself.
New Rick roll
Your a JERK..
Notice me jack or everyone will call you Jonathan and James Charles will hit on you
i love evrything about your channel
What did I just download,,,,so many pop up ads
Finally someone has the same opinion about GOT as me
What a clusterfuck
Millions are at risk of starvation in Yemen, there are open air slave markets in Libya, Venezuela is under modern siege warfare, the US is in an economic war with China that could easily get hot, the Cold War has been restarted with Russia, Bolton sabotaged negotiations with North Korea and wants to start a war with Iran, nobody's actually doing anything about destruction of critical ecosystems, wealth inequality is at its highest level in known history (even beyond ancient Egypt), Western Europe is collapsing socially, economically, culturally and morally. Meanwhile, GoT final season does suck though.
What's the soundtrack for this piece of art ?
This one goes right into the traaaaaash
I legit got the Game of Thrones ad after this, no joke
This is how many times you have seen endgame


üëá
I love GoT season 8 wasn‚Äôt even shit ppl just need to calm down
Bc gpe
Great! Now my head hurts.
damn this games of thrones video is really informative and detailed. I think the points jack brings up should be implamented into the last episode
I subscribed to this channel for quality content.

I still have yet to see it.
who else her has never seen GOT bevore?
my brain when i need to sleep
Hell yeah
The final season of Game of Thrones, and especially the last 3 episodes, have divided and angered many fans of the show. But why? Well, there are a number of reasons for this, so let‚Äôs break down the biggest and most recent problem first - Daenerys.

In last night‚Äôs episode, Daenerys and Drogon rain fire down upon King‚Äôs Landing, killing thousands of innocents. This is all after Cersei‚Äôs armies have surrendered. Now the show‚Äôs writers justify this by claiming it‚Äôs the Mad King storyline coming full circle with his daughter. And, if the show had more episodes and time to develop this extreme choice, it could have made more sense. But we‚Äôre only given 6 episodes this season, as opposed to the usual 10, and the decision to make Daenerys the ‚ÄúMad Queen‚Äù seems rushed and hasty.

Throughout the seasons, we‚Äôve seen Daenerys promise she‚Äôs nothing like her father, as she‚Äôs freed slaves and ruled mostly benevolently. So last night‚Äôs episode largely felt like a betrayal to both fans and her very character. An entire city going up in flames makes for a great visual, sure, but narratively it‚Äôs questionable. Now it appears Daenerys is the show‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Bad,‚Äù and not Cersei.

And that‚Äôs another big problem - Cersei and her fate. Fans were out for blood and wanted a gruesome end for the cold-hearted tyrant. But instead of getting a knife in the heart (like many predicted), she fell victim to rubble. Now one could argue that Daenerys ultimately killed Cersei...but her end still seems somewhat anticlimactic. And that doesn't even begin to address Jaime's problem.

Jaime's redemption arc - where'd it go?! The Lannister most changed from a character standpoint after years of questioning his actions and his loyalty to his lover went back to his old ways all too quickly. In the previous episode, after leaving Brienne, fans had hoped he was on his way to King's Landing just to finish Cersei off himself. But this latest episode proved - NOPE! - he just wanted one last cuddle with his sister-lover. Hm.

In conclusion, we only have 1 episode left, and frankly I‚Äôm excited to see where this all goes.
video was posted two minutes ago and there‚Äôs already got 505 comments
wow this is a pain to render
Bird up
I ain't even mad

I'm very unhappy about the fact that I recognized the pitbull almost instantly.

Solid video
The fact that Thanos is doing KPop choreography in this scares me.

Didn‚Äôt know it was 2013
I‚Äôm going to see avatar again.
love endgame, but you are annoying
i‚Äôve never watched a single episode of GOT
Why did I see this coming
Honestly, didn't know why I thought this would be a serious video. I've been watching you for like 9 years, I should've known better.
My fav video
I loved this
Jack you little stinker
This is what art looks like.
just for this i‚Äôm never gonna watch it
I actually haven't yet...
i agree
I think i just found love
I waiting for this video to get less serious....
This made my year
Saw this video pop out. And knowing Jack, I know this is going to be doing something. So I play this vid just loud enough for my GoT obsessed gf to hear. She demands me to turn it up, so I did, and next thing you know, she gets floored by that shit. 10/10.
Bruhüòë
When comes a new YIAY episode???
Ya know, maybe I should go see Endgame for a third time...
That was something...
You look like Jack from supernatural
I love this season. I‚Äôm totally enjoying it. Screw the haters. Don‚Äôt let other people‚Äôs negativity decrease your ability to enjoy something.

Um.... what the hell was that? While I'm not one to leave awful comments or whatever, I really wish there had just been what you put in the description box. I have tried... and tried.... and tried to watch your videos at different points over the years... still can't do it. Ah well, others seem to enjoy it.
Sorry but this is straight up clickbait
I support this 3000%
the thing about jaime is there is always relapse in redemption arcs. He just made his at the very worst time. I think he would have come to his senses if he were able to be with her for a couple of days
instant like
I still love GOTs
The moment I saw this was a short video I knew something was not right
I agree
Do you think Jack was still explaining Game lf Thrones the whole time?
Thanos looks like he‚Äôs doing Spiderman‚Äôs dance.  You guys know what I‚Äôm talking about.
why is this trending John
How much sweat
I‚Äôd watch Endgame again, but it‚Äôs still fresh in my mind, and I don‚Äôt feel like spending money.
Dear lord...
As someone who still hasn't seen Endgame or the newest season of Game of Thrones yet, I really truly appreciate how few spoilers are in here. Glad I clicked for the chaos. Was not disappointed.
I love this 3000
I knew that the last season will suck send a meteorite and destroy Westeros so we can all be happy
wondering why someone would'nt want to watch a 11 year movie show and watch the finally first
my question is that: are u really promoting end game or you are just being funny?
I thought this would be a normal video
Best got video
My brain hurts
Plz do more
Heads up detective pikachu is trash fr
1:18 Jack is hopping with dead eyes üò∂ I genuinely hope you don't get copystriked. 
Music Industry tries to milk every penny from oldie songs üòå
I CANT WITH ALL THE PROPAGANDA!!
The only reason that I saw end game
Can i please get GOT version
Oh loord
But like..have you?
And why none of those ships could hit that dragon? It seemed so easy to land SEVERAL shots last episode. Maybe it had plot scales.
Just realized it's a Tuesday. And I'm not caught up. And was really confused by those first thing you said about Dany. And before I clicked away to avoid spoilers the endgame propaganda started. Yes I've seen it twice. Trying to work in a time to see it a 3rd time. It's hard when it takes like half of your day to go see it
Only some of the jacks had a stain on the collar.
If thats not subliminal im not sure what is
Thanks, i hate it..
I don‚Äôt watch Game of Thrones so none of this applies to me
I wont watch endgame..whatchu gonna do??
Love it
People are really angry because they used a crybaby like Rodgers to be in it. Crybabies don't need to be in any war.
Mom, can you please come get me? I'm scared
Why did i hear pikachu
#Avatar4ever
I hope the guy that likes to read books shows up out of nowhere swinging his family's sword and kills all of them and gets the iron throne.
She has gone mad
Guys I think this video might be trying to tell us something....
I‚Äôve never wanted to die so badly.
How many attempts did it take to record where you rip the #WatchEndgame and the #BeatAvater paper apart?
H  E  Y      J  U  S  T      S  E  E      E  N   D  G  A  M  E
What did I just stumble across?
0:53 thats Disney dancing who owns both Avatar and Avengers
I wish Jack was in this video.
I approve
Macklemore - Can‚Äôt hold us
so true
What?
Ha Ha! What a nerd.
woah.
Why does he look like trevor in this
my brain at 3
If anyone wanted him to be serious, read the description
Preach.
Wow Jack. Its been a whole month since we have seen YIAY and now you post actual skits and content o.o
#WatchEndgame#BeatAvatar
Not enough nudity
so sweaty
Yes jack I have
Good luck
What a troll lmao
I love you Jack
What's the music ?
lmao
#WatchEndgame
Well this was a mess...
#Watchavatar
How is this on trending
Thank you
ENDGAME = PEWDIEPIE AVATAR = T - SERIES
Let this go viral pleaaase!
What is this endgame?
I am in pain
The best part of this season has been when Ant-Man crawled inside Cersei's asshole and killed her baby, this really put the cherry on top of her arc
sweat
Oh God someone save him
I never watch this guy cause I've always thought "that guy is annoying" until I watched this video I found on trending
I HAVE A MIGRAINE
Why is thanos doing bts moves
MOVIES>TV SHOWS
i think this brainwashed me
So true endgame faggitys everywhere
The 1.3k dislikes are just the people who actually wanted jack talk about game of thrones
Okay and a woah
Haahahahah!!!!!!!
Game Of Thrones sucks. Thank you.
YIAY ???
Ooh yer twending
Bwwwwwwaaaaaaahahahahaha
I hate that I watched this
Is this a video
I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs making fun of marvel fans...really wants it to beat Avatar for a meme....or if he‚Äôs a actual fan.... can someone explain to me what the joke means??
so basically GoT came to first episode where Jon is struggling with his identity,  Jaime still dumb for Cersei, Dany is called Mad King, Sansa the Gossip Girl, Bran the not so warrior like, Arya with Animal, Tyrion being useless.
Can i please just watch the video jack
Honestly the only thing I could pay attention to was Thanos dancing to BTS moves
Another thing I dont know if anyone's had someone kidnapped and murdered in front of you I bet u can't expect a reasonable reaction from someone who's family has a history of incestuous insanity
Can someone make a version without the annoying guy in the background?
This.
I have not
Because they have no life. How pathetic that dumbasses let a tv show dictate their life.
Losers in life.

Can't wait for game of thrones to end, my mom and thias just won't shut up about it. So what, all that happens is sex and fighting.
Am i the only one that noticed the fact that klondike has little marks near her eyes ( that's how I tell them apart in his videos)
hmm, i have the sudden urge to watch endgame again for the 15th time. i dont know why this happens, i mean this is a game of thrones video. oh well. time to see endgame again
5 years from now when the fortnite scene pops up everyone is gonna laugh and say "ohh yeah i forgot about that part haha this movie kinda sucked".  I say stick with the winners like Harry Potter and Maze Runner.
I don‚Äôt see why everyone mad...
Advertisment at it's peak
ion liek ths
I genuinely like avatar tho
Dont watch this high hahaha fuuuuuckk
Beautiful
Jumpscare at 1:48
Get over it ü§¨
I "seen" Endgame.  But I don't give Disney my money.  They get enough of it from monopoly of movie media.
What's terrible is this actually sums it up fairly well
What happened to him is he High on cocaine or something
What?
Umm... Dr.Strange is that you??
This episode was great. People just get way too wrapped up in their stupid theories and predictions that they refuse to accept something is good if it doesn't match it. Exactly like Last Jedi.
0:30
That moment when you're trying to listen to the serious video audio past the obnoxious loud avengers fanboi who nobody really cares about
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fukin nerd
This is what I said to my sister when she I caught her watching avatar.
Pitbull.
yess
I haven't seen any of the infinity wars movies yet. What order and should I view them in? Long fighting scenes makes me dizzy, so I will probably watch the movies half speed to keep score of who punches who and where. Do I have time to watch all the movies half speed before Thongus pull the plug on the universe?
GOT started out good, then it just got stupid. Some things don't even make sense. We stopped watching it.
That feeling when you genuinely wanna hear Jack talk about game of thrones but you get side swiped by Endgame
That subtle reference to endgame lmao
I actually thought he was gonna talk about Game Of Thrones but then this happened
I don't know why but I feel like I should go see endgame
Best thumbnail ever.
HEY DIDJA SEE ENDGAME YET
I want to see subtitles for this.
this man is married
#SEEENDGAMEBEATAVATAR
This is the best propaganda video I've ever seen. Wow, so beautiful
Have you actually kept on talking about GoT the whole time, back there?
I have never seen one episode yet
i haven't seen endgame and have no interest in it
lmao i still haven't seen it
So creative.
Hah that was a funny bit, You said you were gonna talk about one thing, then you didn't ... Hilarious!   Hope your children don't starve with the amount of bank this amazing shit brings in.
Should I go and see end game?
What the hell did i just watched
Thanks now i want to die.
I genuinely want to know what Jack's opinion on got is tho
I literally saw endgame 5 times just because of Jack!
This is truely inspirering. I'll buy avatar on DVD
EndGame and Avatar are brilliant films, adore and love both. Game of Thrones however? IT CAN GO IN THE TTTRRRAAASSHHHH
my favourite jack was on the far right

(not to get political)
watched endgame like 10 times
Guess 11 is a good number
What an A** analysis of Game of Thrones. You really broke everything in detail
When my brain has a new obsession to focus on
I love the background music!
Jack is still the #1 "thanks, I hate it" YouTube shitposter.
i counted down the seconds til the end of the video while watching
just watched for the second time today
i havent watched infinity war yet
This video crashed my phone
I love this.
my quality dropped to 144 in the middle of the video and i thought it was apart of the joke, until it wasn‚Äôt
I don‚Äôt know why but that beat is great with the constant talking
I love this
M8 i aint gonna spend three hours on one movie
Can we call yiay iay because i don‚Äôt even remember when he asked us
I‚Äôve seen it twice, go see it again? Ok I am, because I‚Äôm gonna watch Endgame. Beat Avatar.
Glad I took time to look at the description, that‚Äôs actually really informative, thanks Jack!
"Hail hydra "

Why is no-one talking about the perfect tear at 0:59?
I love how he gets progressively more sweaty
the pitbull in the barely audible background is really a plus
hey you seen endgame yet?
Can I get a 10 hour loop of just the middle part of the video?
I should have known better
For a sec I thought it's Simon cowell in the thumbnail
it keeps going
Ok I gonna watch endgame agian
Yo dude, why the spoilers?
I‚Äôm white and this video has made me lit
Agreed.
Very gud video thanks jack
Yes
Mommy my ears are bleeding...
So this is the big video....
Was Jack sweating or did he drool on his Capt. America shirt?
Different type of Jacks:
Normal
Hashtag
Dancing
DID YOU SEE ENDGAME
Tell others to vote
please upload raw footage of dancing jack.
Please
Jesus Jack i have seen endgame stop asking me XD
I imagine this is how it is in Jack's head every day. Just yelling and anxiety!
Yeah Jack I completely agree with you. 

There is a standard of plot that game of thrones sets in the world of TV. However, the last few episodes have been satisfactory.  I mean don't get me wrong, the unfolding of the plot is better than most of TV shows out there. But I expected more. I loved the way how they unfolded the last episode of Season 7.

I hope last episode can get me excited for how everything turns out.
Just Jack, getting progressively sweatier.
You look like Ant Man in the thumbnail
M A Y B E C U Z I T S U C K S
And unsurprisingly, I got a Game of Thrones game ad before this video.
This should be an ad on YouTube
wew bro you didn't give me a spoiler alert, im not on the latest season yet.





p.s endgame sucks and avatar was better
what a beautiful way to start my morning
".. They had us in the first half..."
you had us at the first half, not gonna lie
Anybody else have problems hearing the audio?
Endgame of thanoses
I'm sure your computer must have loved to edit this video.
He really is on the edge of his seat with the money totals.
y does his hair always look wet
Is thanos dancing Fire by BTS? lol
Yo Jack, thanks for the nightmares
I dont watch game of thrones
I dont care lol
Hey... D'you see Endgame yet?
i think Jack wants us to watch Endgame.
I was actually intrested in what you had to say about GoT Jack...
I live for the thousand people who dislike this sort of video
BIG PROJECT
See the description if you want to know what he said
This gig is like shrek - has LOOOOTS OF LAYERS!!
Just watch anime instead
You had me there in that first half
This is a migraine on a video
My favourite Jack is the far back right one. He seems to like dancing and Endgame
Lol End Game yasss
Yo for some reason I have a sudden urge to watch Endgame. Anyone else get that as well?
Nice Clickbait
gendry wins the throne
is that Macklemore I cannot even
I met this madlab
I‚Äôve seen endgame three times for the cause just walk out at the start #watchendgame
SKIP TO 2:48 to avoid that really epic audio echo
Avatar made so much money because no one could remember if they saw it so they kept going back.
"She has terrible taste in films guys..."

Is that why she married Jacksfilms then?
This should be renamed to "Jack justifying his hate for avatar for 53 minutes"
my mom didn‚Äôt like that you put titanic in b tier

she started her anger with ‚Äúok hey buddy‚Äù
Kinda Endgame Spoiler





That‚Äôs America‚Äôs S
I thought that echo thing was on purpose
Jacksfilm: ‚ÄúAny movie with kids in it is brought down to c tier‚Äù
Morgan stark: ‚ÄúAm I joke to you?‚Äù
everyone: go watch endgame so it beats avatar!
Disney who owns both: >:)
Imagine if Endgame was one dollar away from topping Avatar.
Dear jacksfilms.

Please never cheat on your wife or send nudes to minors. I wouldn't want the career of another youtuber who I used to watch growing up to end.

Thank you
Avatar? Oh the one with the sexy blue people?
No wait that‚Äôs the live action Sonic movie.
Jack when Endgame is out: watch Endgame beat Avatar 
Jack when Shrek 5 comes out: watch Shrek 5 beat Endgame
Endgame: "I'm gonna break 3 billion! look who's #1 now!"


Gone With the Wind: "My beer was held in 1939"
MAJOR SPOILERS IN MY COMMENT, YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN WARNED. 

My favourite part of the Titanic is when the ship hit into the iceberg.
people sending money to jack instead of buying more endgame tickets with it smh
Endgame: *Is catching up*
Avatar: We are in the Endgame now.
Knowing Jacksfilms I could totally see him doing the echo thing as a joke
It honestly baffles me that some people don‚Äôt know that 7 Rings was based on that song from Sound of Music
What's with the sudden surge of unironic and non-satirical videos by Jack?
I thought I was the only one who cared about how much endgame grossed






I checked the Wikipedia page every 5 minutes
I'm so confused I thought Shark Boy and Lava Girl revolutionized 3D.
Jack: "Go see Endgame, let's make it beat Avatar!"
Also Jack: "I've seen it once"
I'll attempt to name 3 characters
1. Blue Gamora
2. Wimpy Legs Guy
3. Smurf¬ø
I thought the echo was just like an epic super meta joke the who time, like I thought that was gonna be the joke of the whole video and was totally ready to accept it.
he said let us begin during titanic ranking

let us sounds like lettuce

iceberg lettuce


iceberg



titanic
Name 3 characters from avatar:
1- Blue Gamora
2- Blue dude
3- That Human
The final list for the "adjusted for inflation" category looks like the Nepal Flag!!!!!!
Literally Fast and Furious 7 wouldn't have made over $1 billion if Paul Walker didn't die! 


Damn you Paul
‚ÄúAny movie with kids in it is at least a C‚Äù... I love you 3000
Jack's got a bookmark called "where'd my dad go"
Avengers Endgame becoming the highest grossing film of all time:

"I'm inevitable"
1. The highest grossing film of all time (if you adjust for inflation) is Gone With the Wind (somehow). 
No, Owen does not have a last name.
Chris Pratt‚Äôs name doesn‚Äôt change his characters forgettable name is different tho.
How did you get a top grossing counter for Endgame?
cap: take away the armour what have you got?

Tony: genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist
12:57 "People wanted to kill each other and I like that"
Marvel Fans /
Then : Avengers
Now : Avengers

DC Fans/
Then : Dark Knight
Now : Avatar
‚ÄúPeople wanted to killer each other and I liked it.‚Äù - Jacksfilms [2019]
Jack:‚Äúany movie with kids in it it‚Äôs already a C movie‚Äù18:19
Me: So I take it you haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄúIT‚Äù
Too bad Harry Potter isn‚Äôt in here
Should replace avatar
Jack: puts Furious 7 smack in the middle by default Bc he hasn‚Äôt seen it.

Jack: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
‚ÄúAvatar isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs just... forgettable‚Äù




The truth has never been more clear
The endgame sales are at 2.5 billion.
We're in the Endgame now.
Later in 2019: Shrek 5 releases
Jack: makes 20 videos on it
You know you've become jaded to Jack's sense of humor when you hear the audio echo at the beginning and go  "Oh .... That's the bit?.... alright let's do this...."
Avengers endgame went up $100,000,000 for the duration of the video
Avatar went up $0
I like how Jacksepticeye has the counter down there
Age of Ultron is grossly underrated imo 

If you watch it again after seeing Endgame you really grow to appreciate how much Whedon set up the latter half of the Infinity Saga
You should create a live stream of Avengers vs Avatar. Have the two box office numbers next to each other with a difference like the PewDiePie vs Tseries stream
If only Stan Lee could see this...he would be proud
Jack: ranks star wars TFA above a new hope

Me: so uncivilized
Endgame is in the top ten, even adjusted for inflation. Wikipedia must have not updated yet when you made this.
That's the best thumbnail ever give that a S
Everyone ripping off TierZoo but giving no credit smh :(
can we all acknowledge that through the whole video, endgame gained more than 100,000,000 dollars
Doctor zhivago was probably an S tier, directed by the man who did Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai.
who else sees the Jim Carrey Grinch-recovered.jpg
"Any movie with a kid in it is already brought down to a c"

Remember I love you 3000? 
name one character from Avatar: Jesus Christ
Jack is exactly like me I‚Äôm not to crazy over Star Wars movie have never watched a fast and furious movie and I love the avengers
Man Star Wars: The Last Airbender is my favourite avatar
Redneck Thanos: "All dat fo' ra droppa bluud" spits out loogie
jacksfilms: "People wanted to kill each other, and I like that"
personal rankings(top 10 without inflation)
S - endgame, infinity war
A - titanic, avengers
B - force awakens
C- furious 7
D - jurassic world, Black panther
E - age of ultron
F - avatar
Avengers endgame: "you could not live with your own failure"
17:07 oh! We're half way through which means this video shouldn't take lon- 
33 minutes left
Your Grammar Sucks #100 for S+ tier.
My list:
S: Infinity War
A: Endgame
B: Titanic, Avengers
C: Jurassic World, Avatar, Black Panther
D: Age of Ultron
E:
F: Force Awakens

Never seen Furious so idk where that goes
I like how avatar never goes up
i thought the echo was on purpose and it was gonna be like a weird performance art thingy
Fun fact, Infinity War would have made more money than Force Awakens if Deadpool 2 and the Han Solo movie (not that it mattered), were released way later after Infinity War
I do think that JW should be C tier minimum. JW goes deep into the in-canon stories involving hybrids. The spinosaurs was said to be a Hybrid and people expected to see more. Then you have the deleted scene of the Stegoceratops but didn‚Äôt add it but later be seen on a computer screen. This then allowed to opportunity to create the I-Rex with over 10 creatures fused with it. Not the mention the storyline base of it where Owen turns out to be good with kids after not wanting them and that links to the old franchise of Alan Grant not wanting kids but ending up to be good with kids. This movie has impeccable CGI too and has subtle hints. There‚Äôs a scene where the T-Rex destroyed the Spinosaurus skeleton which was a hit back from JP3 where the Spino killed the T-Rex. There‚Äôs so many moments like that in the movie and I think you just didn‚Äôt look into it and hated it without a fair explanation. 
Oh by the way, his name is Owen Grady. Not like it‚Äôs mentioned 15 times during the movie ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Endgame Started The Stream With 2.227 And Ended With 2.379...
Does anyone know where Jack found that live gross counter for avatar?
did he actually put age of ultron and furious 7 in the same category?
If Avatar is tier F, we must pay respects.
This guy said billion instead of million, he has no right to put AVATER in the F tier


#avatarIsAtier 




Also a joke if ur offended
Roses are red 
Spider-Man is sad
He wants iron man to be his dad
the beginning was true art 
watch at 0:00 and repeat back to zero when you get to 2:48
I really loved the scene In endgame where [REDACTED] picked up [DATA EXPUNGED]
Never heard this many voice cracks in one video :D
Avatar vs Endgame feels like the next PewDiePie vs T-Series.
but you know which villain is better than thanos? 
noobmaster69
D for Jurassic World? 
I'd put it on a B
I thought the echo was intentional:(
7 Rings... Sounds familiar... 7 Rings...




SEVEN RINGS IN HAND!!
SPEED THROUGH NIGHT WITH FEET IN SAND!!
January 1, 2020 anyone ???
This channel is taking a great turn. More shitposting thanks
give endgame 80 years and adjusted for inflation it will beat gone with the wind
you should use the echo in a video like someone that wants to be a epic streamer but cant figure out OBS
The Bee Movie should've been the highest grossing film honestly
When a certain character picks up a certain thing


I love it
If you have 3 and half hours to kill,








WATCH ENDGAME
24:03 They never t ick led my...
nice voicecrack lol
Jack: *Does not spoil Endgame

Thanos: You have my respect Stark
I'd take Gone With the Wind over Avatar, fight me
Even though I haven't seen it, Doctor Zhivago was still more rememberable than Avatar
‚ÄúAll movies with kids are brought down to a C‚Äù

Avengers endgame: ...
Is it bad my first thought for Chris Pratt‚Äôs character was Owen...Wilson?
Think wizard of oz must‚Äôve came first but yeah both gone with the end and that are the first filmed in color;)
I thought the audio echo was gonna be the whole video and was prepared to sit through it all
You forgot the greatest movie




Shrek ‚àû
I cant believe i just watched a grown man rank movies for a whole hour
Is Jack being serious and legitimately critiquing films?? Like, it was still a funny video, but he wasn‚Äôt just meming and being purposefully dumb like usual. I quite enjoyed this

Edit: at least for the first part haha
Three characters from Avatar
1-blue Man group
2-smurfette
3-will Smith's genie
AGE OF ULTRON LITERALLY SET UP CIVIL WAR ESAUFSWUIOEDRFV9IWRESG9IW
That echo in the back makes this video the all so better, almost seems like something Jack would just do as a joke lol.
How do you feel about your ranking in Dunkeys tierlist, Jacksepticeye?
I can‚Äôt wait for a random nobody YouTuber to go viral with a tier video on youtubers.
This is the true jacks films. üòÇüòÇ
i agreed with every decision on this list.  subbed
I think jack might be a marvel fan
32:05 so does endgame you fanboy!!!!!


IDC I love endgame no matter what watched it 4 times
I remember when Titanic came out on VHS... you had to watch it on 2 separate VHS tapes.
"It's just.. a forgettable movie!"



Just like shrek 3-
Gone With The Wind < Black Panther
i glanced at the chat and saw
"can you make a video when shrek 5 passes endgame?"
‚ÄúA certain character picks up a certain thing‚Äù all I can think of is Loki picking up the tesseract. Love that greasy boy!
Guys we have until September to do this!  WE CAN DO IT!
Wow teir list are more popular than I thought now
Jack: ‚ÄúGo watch endgame twice!‚Äù
Me: laughs because I‚Äôve seen it four times
F because I wasn‚Äôt watching while it was live
my favorite avenger is alexander hamilton üòé
Low key disappointed that the avatar ticker wasn‚Äôt just slowly decreasing throughout the stream
If I had 3 and a half Hours, I‚Äôd watch Endgame
For a fourth time
I was so sure the echo was part of the meme factor until he turned it off.
Anyone else notice that endgame has gained 150 million during that hour and that hour alone
Why get four more Avatar movies when you can just watch Endgame four more times?
Were you drunk while recording this? because i love it!
Is nobody gonna mention that endgame made 100million in one hour?
yeah fuckface, review fortnite the musical next time.
Avatar : Still way too much , eat it up
Btw no one has bought Avatar since this was streamed
I agree with this so much. Even down to me not seeing a single Furious movie,
i only know chris pratt‚Äôs name because it‚Äôs my actual name
Is this the big project you‚Äôve been working on?
Jack:
"The Titanic is a bit long"


Also Jack:
12:37 never heard anyone talk about Star Wars like that
28:18 Jacksfilms is furry confirmed?
I agree with the thumbnail
Tier list on Avatar characters????






 
Seeing Jack talk about movies like he's a dumb toddler makes me smile.
GO ENDGAME. HULKDAB YEAH BOIIII.
Endgame was 3 hours but it felt like 20 minutes (I watched it in Imax and it was amazing)
End Game on top
Shrek 5 aka Bibile 5: W8 for me
Look at the tabs that he's been on before
Avatar: We are the better movie because we have blue people
Nebula: Am I a joke to you?
Nice echo, and of course the video itself is quite long aswell 2/10
I stopped watching because of the echo
Every avengers movie is in the top 10 of the highest grossing films of all time...





...avengers is the best franchise confirmed?



P.S. Lets beat Avatar
Fails at every sport he plays 
Alexander cannot win
well then, this was a thing, and the double playback at the start is incredible
Chris Pratt's character is called Owen Wilson
Avatar was good. Not memorable, but it was good. Stop bullying Avatar
Only person from avatar that I remember is Jake because my name is Jake
''People wanted to kill each other and I liked that'' - John Patrick Douglass, May 7 2019
If EndGame doesn‚Äôt beat avatar (that is HIGHLY unlikely) then we still have Spider-Man: Far From Home to count on
Oh gawd! I am NOT going to watch Jack rate less than 20 movies movies for nearly an hour.
does exactly that
Name an avenger:
That thumbnail is facts
Even Endgame beats Avatar Zoe Saldana still wins regardless.üòÑüëå
There are literally 24/7 cinemas in the phil. JUST for endgame
i watched avatar again 2 years ago because i forgot what the movie was about but i fell asleep and never finished it
I bought 10 IMAX tickets to Endgame. I only showed up for 3 of them, and I convinced my friends to do the same(one of them saw it all 10 times).
Groot is a kid so is endgame automatically c?
I really hoped this was gonna be 53 minutes of more and more echo layers coming in until it's a jarbled mess.
Jack: "There would be no this without this"
Jack: puts two Avengers sequels above The Avengers
John: So to recap...

Me: Aw shit here we go again
Atleast we got to hear a voice crack a thousand times
Is the this project was talking jack about big
‚ÄúPeople wanted to kill each other and I like that.‚Äù 

Didn‚Äôt know jack was a psychopath
All Avengers movies are in top 10, rofl, lol, ha, lmfao, I‚Äôm dying
Bee movie - SSS+ Tier
Jack> Any movie with kids in it is automatically brought down to a C
Also Jack> Places Endgame in S Tier

Bruh
The prequels were better.


You sir, are wanted by r/prequelmemes police.
When he says a certain character picks up a certain thing, he means  when thor picks Thanos up and starts sucking his balls
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a B movie‚Äù

*screams in Seinfeld*
Is the box office meter really Live?

I doubt.
how do you do a tier list
Jack was so proud when he made that bee movie joke you can tell
This was an oddly serious video from Jack, nice.
I loved it when Thor picked up Captain America's shield. What a spicy meatball
i've been waiting 3 long years for the sequel to the Kidzbop Quiz
I thought the echo was a bit. Like jacksfilms for Android.
sab
cdef
I thought the echo was part of the joke
Titanic: I am gonna B generous
Endgame, moving towards the #1 spot: I am inevitable
i mean avatar is only rank 15, if you adjust the price for inflation.
YIAY ? heh...
more like LMIAY. (last month i asked you)
BECAUSE THE LAST YIAY WAS A GODDAMN MONTH AGO GET ON IT JOHN.
Going to see Endgame for the THIRD TIME today! :D
I don't think jack liked the blue kitty cats
WATCH ENDGAME SO IT BEATS GONE WITH THE WIND!!!
53 minutes and 10 seconds of unedited, pure shitposting. Beautiful.
"jim carrey grinch-Recovered.jpg" LOL!
Avatar is good tho
5 of the top 10 are MCU films, and all 4 avengers movies are there
Burger King now has "YAAAS Meals"
If i had 3 hours to kill the film i should watch endgame, thank you veryyyyy much
literally all but one film in the top 10 are dogshit
Imagine dedicating 53 minutes to hating on a film that Endgame wont beat
I think these are his genuine opinions but he still sounds scathingly ironic.
jacksfilms fangirling over marvel is what i live for
4:47 what's a pandora (yes I watched the movie and I just realised pandora is what their land is called)
love that lossy compression for those thumbnails
I'm Italian and I find it kinda funny how Jack said "Mamma mia" more times in an hour than I did in the last few days
Is watching the movie in theaters twice the equivalent of making multiple accounts to subscribe
no Fast and Furious?





sorry I'm a car enthusiast
You need to start saying whatever it takes more it'll turn into a meme pretty quick
Also I seems like you're serious in the video is that on purpose
Arnt these the same graphics as tierzoo
Someone should do a tier list of jack‚Äôs body parts 
That forehead is definitely S tier
What if avatat two (2) come out? 

What would it be like?

What would be to stories or lines they say?
I am sad 
My favorite movie is not here




(It‚Äôs Star Wars: infinitygame)
That adjusted for inflation list is only up to 2017 tho
i thought the echo was intentional and it added so much
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bee movie‚Äù
Remove the Dad because I don't have one, but Mr. Jacksfilms had the exact same experience with Avatar that I did
Tay Zonday flashbacks
name one character from avatar:
me: zoe saldana
That America‚Äôs ass‚Äî Robert Downey jr/ tony stark/Iron man
damn, this boy 
R E A L L Y hates avatar
furious 7's rank  is balanced like all things should be
Furious 7 is E tier, change my mind.
Wikipedia was not updated averages endgame was higher than the force awakens
Why does he have a photoshop tab that says "jim carrey grinch"
this is just a glamorized top ten list with a cooler design
Avatar is basically the 1-2 Switch of movies
‚ÄúPeople wanted to kill each other, and I like that‚Äù

-jack 2k19
first was t-series vs pewdiepie
now its endgame vs avatar the not air bender
Chris Pratt‚Äôs name in Jurassic World is Owen Grady
PewDiePie vs. tseries

More like avatar vs end game 

Hahaha
‚ÄúAny movie with kids is instantly moved down to a C tier.‚Äù Um, Morgan... from endgame
Jack, explain
I like how you started this drama with literally no one else involved.
Me:Do homework

Jack:üë¶üèª
You should do the same thing but for example, ranking every Star Wars movie, or ranking every marvel movie.
Oh that little surprise with the second list made my day, that's why we love you :)
I'd flip black panther and age of Ultron and I'd 100% agree with this
Wait hold on this is nearly an hour long!?
Wow he really doesn't like Avatar. I freaking live for that movie. It's so beautiful. And I can name 1 characterüòÇ Neytiri
Put Furious 7 in E Tier
avengers endgame increased by about 151,982,211 dollars in this video alone
"My wife Erin really loves Gone with the Wind, but she also loves The Animal starting Rob Schneider, so I can't really trust my wife's opinion"
its the twitter for android of audio
Cue the Avatar 4D theatrical re-release to keep it at #1
"People wanted to kill eachother, and I like that."
Jack...Endgame was 3 hours as well...
My new Bio: I‚Äôm the person who gets invited to house parties out of pity üò¢
shrek 5 be like: nah bruv
i really thought the echo was on purpose and i was so excited to hear the painful audio that would be the end of the stream
Finnaly a tier list I agree with
I subbed just because the first ranking
Cap and Iron Man never collect all the dragon balls in Endgame. Everyone quits and goes home. So sad.
Jacksfilms talking about filmsüòØ
The second list looks vaguely like the shape of the Nepal flag
i didnt know that people loved last airbender so much
I wood like another Quezshon Boiiz pls
#WatchEndGameToBeatTheBluePeople
If you have 3.5 hours to kill, don't waste your time with Titanic, watch Endgame.
I have seen Avengers at least 10 times :))
Seen endgame 4 times
This truly is the endgame
jack complians about titanic‚Äôs length

Endgame is like 3 hours
John should be getting a 0.00001% cut of the endgame profits for promo
What in the living hell is Doctor Zhivago
There's about 5 Avengers movies in that top 10
this video confirms that any movie over 3 hours is a top grossing film
The original star wars being in anybodies' C tier list is insane. Without it there is no blockbuster, as we know it today. Lol RIP
the smile he cracks upon saying "it's a B(ee) movie"
My mom loves avatar. I bet she watched it so many times that she probably knows all the characters. 





help me
The 1st list I was on board......the 2nd one hurt me
Cool video, until you realize one of his bookmarks in chrome is called ANALytics..
i like that the Verge is bookmarked "...dad?"
What do you mean hope that the endgame will become first.
I've seen Endgame 3 times......
Dude that‚Äôs what I did saw it regular first and imax second
Avatar scared me when I first watched it... the blue dudes are pretty much my sleep paralysis demons
WHAT'S WRONG WITH AVATAR
Amazing video bro
haha I got that ‚Äútitenic‚Äù joke! good times!
I‚Äôm so glad you put infinity war at least equal to endgame
I honestly thought the Audio echo was on purpose
Can do do a livestream of you watching avatar
Lmao the echo made it funnier! Thanks Jack. You ruined a great opportunity for an amazing meme.
Moment you put infinity war and the endgame in the S tier, you have proven yourself to be a marvel fanboy. Honestly none of those top 10 deserves S tier.
18:30 His name is Owen Grady...
This meme format is so simple yet so good
in this video Endgame went up by about $150 million
I haven‚Äôt even heard of Gone with the Wind, The Sound of Music, The Ten Commandments or Doctor Zhivago
‚ÄúFamily Guy has riffed on Sound of Music a couple of times, which I think counts for something.‚Äù

Uhh... Family Guy made three specials each remaking a film from the original Star Wars trilogy soooooo...
This takes him omost a hour to do (I cant spell omost)
I was the first one to comment Owen on the livestream. This is now my greatest accomplishment.
YES SHOUTOUT TO MY BOY VGDUNKEY
Furious 7 Should Be At Least B
His name was Owen Grant. I think. Who knows.
I'm sickened that you would insult The Sound of Music by putting a glorified remake of 7 Samurai next to it
Avatar 2 isn‚Äôt gonna even come in the top 10 when it‚Äôs released
The only thing everyone  remember about avatar is HAIR SEX üòèüòèüòè
Where would the emoji movie rank?
I think Infinity War had more action but I think Endgame had more character
u really did that to E.T damn dude what happened to ur soul
I thought the echo thing was definitely on purpose cuz that seems like him lol
Thanks to you, I'll watch it a fifth time
Damn talking about memes, wouldn't the emoji be literally the best movie
Jake, mo-an, and uh... jo-an?
I really appreciate how avatar is a reoccurring thing on this channel
This isn‚Äôt a 50 minute joke?
Pewdiepie v t series may be over but.....




Now we have endgame v avatar
10:30
B-longs
Sounds like Cuck Complex‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Shrek 5: hold my beer
Minecraft movie: not so fast
Star Wars force awakens on B? I was thinking like D or E
Avatar characters 
1.Weird X-men avatar girl
2.smurf man thingit 
3.that one dude who was lazy as ass and stayed in a pod the entire movie
24:03 thank me later
7:07 i think he was talming about when thor takes korgs headset
... It nearly made me cry when you put Doctor Zhivago in F :O
Oh yeah The dude from Endgame was Iron Man and that thing from endgame was the Infinity Gauntlet
Titanic is so much more memorable, quotable, and overall iconic than Black Panther. Should be A Tier.
Adjusted for inflation then Avatar and Titanic are still quite comfortable. $3 billion plus in 2019.
I seriously bet that Stan Lee came down and whispered into Jack's ear to get everyone to watch Endgame
I liked Avatar. Cant wait until they make more (they are planning on making 4 more I believe.. yes after all this time).
E for E.T? You are an empty soulless thing!
UPDATE: 2ND HIGHEST GROSSING FILM OF ALL TIME 
IT'S HAPPENING
#WATCHENDGAME #BEATAVATAR
Does Avatar have America's Ass?


Yeah that's what I thought. Hulk dab let's go!!
Ask mr beast for help, he might just buy out a whole cinema's tickets for endgame to beat avatar
If Endgame doesn't beat avatar, I don't know what will. 
Some people think avatar is better... But not us.


Not us.
Whatever it takes.
We love endgame 3000.


 : ENDGAME JUST BEAT AVATAR!  
Boys, we already let pewdiepie lose to tseries, we can't let Endgame lose to Avatar. We won't be defeated, not again.
Watch Endgame.
Avengers Endgame should be scared of The Emoji Movie 2.
Endgame deserves to be #1. It is the most satisfying conclusion to a series of movies I've ever seen. Plus the scale. Sure we have the conclusion of movie trilogys (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, etc), but Endgame is the conclusion to a 22 movie mega franchise. And what is Avatar? IDK it looked pretty I guess.
i've seen endgame.
yeah your boi got his free taco
Roses are red
Spider-Man‚Äôs not dead
Thor finally went for the head!
avatar is just a puppet controlled by the true enemy: gone with the wind adjusted for inflation
Does Avatar have Noobmaster69?


I think not.
Endgame is at 2.5 billion as of now!!
Does Avatar have a cringy Fortnite scene?
I THINK NOT!
"is Avengers: Endgame the greatest film of all time?"
-nods negatively 
YES
lmao Zoe Saldana receiving her pays for Avatar and Endgame
you know he's serious when he doesn't include any forehead jokes.
‚ÄúEndgame will beat Avatar‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, we will. Because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do if it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù
Do note that Zoe Saldana acted in both movies lmao...
I loved Endgame and it deserves to beat Avatar, although to be fair many films deserve to beat it as well.
To those of you who have no interest in watching it, I didn't either until I heard about 2 weeks ago, so I decided to watch all the other movies and then endgame, and I've decided that it's the best movie franchise of all time. So seriously. GO WATCH ENDGAME.
If Endgame doesn't beat Avatar...


Shrek 5 will.
Meanwhile, Zoe Saldana is laughing in the background because she wins either wayü§£
I've watched endgame 3 times and  it's all i can do...
Shrek 2 is (unironically) the perfect sequal
2019 Jacksfilms: Is Avengers Endgame the greatest movie ever? Yes.
2017 Jacksfilms: Is The Emoji Movie the best movie ever? Yeeeess.
1:37 Is Avengers: Endgame the best film of all time? Yes.

Emoji movie: Am I a joke to you?
He isn't joking this time and I agree with him a lot!! We need to make ENDGAME #1. #LoveYou3000
I don‚Äôt have any money,

jack throws $200 dollars

WATCH ENDGAME!
People:- Watch Endgame multiple times so that it can beat Avatar.
Disney who owns both:- ah yeah, here we go again (evil laugh emoji)
My fav character in endgame was infinity man. #thanosGotReverseCarded
Jack's Films for once is actually about films
I hope Endgame beats Avatar but it definitely isn't the best movie of all time.
We need MrBeast to buy enough tickets to help Endgame beat Avatar
Hey, if it failed we could just snap Avatar out of existence.
Jack: Is Avengers: Endgame the greatest film of all time?
Head: no
Every other body part: YES




 btw
Flagged for racism. The way Jack talks about Blue People is disgusting
ENDGAME is the best movie of all time. Spoiler:





Korg was just amazing, hats off to Taika Watiti for being the funniest person alive üòÇ
Just watched endgame two times.
I'mma watch it again.
Promise me you will watch endgame as many time as you could just to make endgame beat avatar.




Whatever It Takes.
A dead body
Jackfilm's whispers-watch endgame
End Game has Thor swearing at a kid who plays fortnite, Avatar does not
I watched endgame and I still haven‚Äôt seen infinity war #watchendgame
Watching Endgame sure feels like you play GTA 5 but for me, Avatar is like playing a dead game such as fifa
Soon you'll have to make a livestream as endgame beats avatar called "watch endgame beat avatar"
I like Avatar but do prefer Endgame...
"do you really want the blue people movie to stay number 1?"
Nebula: Am I a joke to you
I found the secret of this films they both have zoe Saldana in it in Endgame as Gamora and in Avatar as Neytiri
This is officially my favourite video of all time.
Is endgame the best movie of all time ? ... YES
It's now #2. WE'RE SO CLOSE! AVENGERS (FANS) ASSEMBLE!
We like Avatar but we love endgame 3000
This is the first time I have ever watched this guy and I love this dude already
Me: 
Spiderman - iron man -  infinity war- endgame . Makes so much sense.
ENDGAME IS AT 2.617 BILLION RIGHT NOW
What am I tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to.
Does Avatar have a scene where Jake Sully plays Fortnite and Sigourney Weaver dabs?


I THINK NOT
bruh Endgame is soooo close
We are so close to beating it.... We‚Äôre in the endgame now...
zoe saldana: meh, i dont really care.
You should do an ‚ÄúAvengers Endgame In 4 words‚Äù YIAY
We don't want the blue people, we want the purple man
Avatar: You can't defeat me!
Infinity War: I know I can't, but he can!
Avengers: Endgame bursts open the door
At least I can remember the names of the blue alien in Endgame amiright
loved Avatar but he ain't lying
Avengers has Spider-Man riding a Pegasus, Avatar does not. 

It‚Äôs a no contest really




Edit: Apologies if Spidey living was a spoiler to you. Marvel marketing kinda spoiled it a while ago cause dudes got a movie coming out in 2 months.
Lol I haven't even seen avatar
ngl I watched avatar because I thought it was related to Avatar: the last Airbender.
i havent watched Avatar.....

BUT I HAVE WATCHED ENDGAME  2 TIMES ALREADY
Jack, obviously when Shrek 5 comes out, it‚Äôll top both Endgame and Avatar
"do you really want the blue people movie to stay number 1?"
Nebula: Am I a joke to you?
Oh I‚Äôm sorry did you watch avatar?

WATCH ENDGAME
1:38 
nope star wars is the greatest film of all time
We need another one of these videos
#WatchEndgame
#BeatAvatar
Tbh when I saw Avatar, I wasn't impressed with it in my opinion. I didn't like it all that much, just was there to experience it in 3D. I agree that Endgame should beat Avatar, I really loved this film.
Avengers has dabbing hulk, Avatar does not.

Checkmate.
Good news everyone Avengers endgame has officially beaten avatar
Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm gonna see it 2 more times.
Sadly, I have heard someone say "I can't wait for the Avatar sequels." I'm planning to ignore them until Endgame is on top.
300M to go, mhmm maybe it can
avatar has replayability because you forget the plot minutes after it ends
Everyone let's go for endgame
I don‚Äôt think this vid is gonna age wellüò≠
Either way Gamora wins???
endgame was bad tho
Endgame has Fortnite and Hulk dabbing 
Avatar has hair sex
Endgame has beaten avatar domestically today
I wasted 9+ hours of my life watching Endgame 3 times.

Watching it for the 4th time ~

Jack is wasting his time. 
Even if Endgame gets the number one spot, everyone knows Sonic The Hedgehog will take it right after
Titanic to Avatar: Avenge me!
EndGame should be scared of 
John Wick 3, Sonic
It's dropping fast :( Still have hope! #whateverittakes
and today's sponsor is marvel movies.
watch endgame, beat avatar.
This was an un-ironic, 100% serious video, about a real-life topic.


Should I be scared?
star wars rules 'the rise of Sky Walker' will wreck you
If you think for a minute.... this is kinda rasict Purple People over Blue People........ Oh Sorry......Oops.....Watch Endgame
About to go watch it for the 3rd time #didmypart
I don't even know what Avatar looks like. That's the guy with the arrow on his head right?
Aquaman drowns in endgame sorry for the the spoilers
WE LOVE ENDGAME 3000.
AVATAR IS IN THE 6 TO 900 RANGE.
it's ok if endgame doesn't win because we got shrek 5 as are trump card
Both served their place according to the innovation they had. 
Avatar: Beautiful and immersive CGI, innovation at it's full potential who change the movie industry forever. 

Endgame: The culmination of 10 years of incredible and entertaining movies, with one of the best character arcs in the movie history.
I can't choose which one is better.
Avatar or End Game

I know



Pirates of  Caribbean sea
Pewdiepie VS TSeries ends




End Game VS Avatar starts up


I love our community
Endgame: 9.5/10
Avatar: 6/10
The only reason Avatar is no. 1 is because in 2009 there were no other movies to watch..
Damn, he just being racist towards blue people. I'm gonna report this vid


Jk, i agree with this guy
I care so little about beating Avatar that not only have I not seen Endgame yet, I'm waiting till the next $6 Sunday at my movie theater to see it.

I literally refuse to pay more than $6 for a ticket.
There's no way Endgame will beat avatar. Not when they have such iconic characters like
I want Endgame to beat Avatar worlwide. But I'd rather it beats The Force Awakens domestic, which isn't looking good at the moment.
Hold up gone with the wind is over 3 billion tho
Call me crazy, but I think Jacksfilms likes Endgame
Earned $1.2 Billion Dollars in One week 

Never Done Before
Look, it isn't a competition or something but we love Endgame 3000 and I believe that avatar was more in the 6 to 900 range
Watch Endgame become the subject of the next yiay
Shrek 5 comes.
Jack: Watch Shrek 5  Beat Endgame
THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO
FeEl AcOmPLiShEd PewDiePie drew the most amazing chariactor in movoe history... SHREK üò±üòà
I love the part of Endgame where Thanos was eating lasagne for 10 hours
I watched it 3 times i cried to 3000
Jacksfilms kind sir, I DARE you to fix the all star music video.
I didn‚Äôt even watch infinity war and I still watched endgame
jacksfilms made a video about films
Don't watch endgame there are spoilers!üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Pepper Potts is Avatar (love you 600) and Tony Stark is Endgame (Love you 3000)
you do not like avatar, you are not a human but endgame is the best
This isn‚Äôt Jackfilms. He said Endgame is the best movie of all time. He forgot about the Emoji Movie. WHO ARE YOU?!?!?!
The thing to keep in mind about Avater is that it‚Äôs #1 because it was HUGE internationally. Domestically speaking, more americans already watched The Force Awakens and Endgame and Infinity War and Jurassic World than they did Avatar.
Thank you this was what the world needed
Ummm.... I had an Avatar shirt. Does that disqualify me? Cuz I already saw endgame
Ya'll better watch endgame until you remember every scene!!#WatchEndgame
Sonic will make 8 billion in the first screening alone...
det pikachu gonna be the dark horse whos gonna end up beating it, just watch out XD
Avatar: We are The ultimate MOVIE! 



Endgame Thor: Hold my beer




Endgame Thor: Actually on second thoughts I‚Äôll take the beer with me...


Sorry for spoilers



BTW Garfield shoots batman with an M14
My mom said she wanted to see the next avatars today üò≠üòÇ 

I wanted to crawl in a ball and die.
After you adjust for inflation, gone with the wind is the highest grossing movie of all time
Avatar Disgusts Me. I'm Sorry.

The Avengers Weren't The Only Ones With An Endgame, But Now Their Movie Is Fighting One.

.
Lol just found this vid and I have been watching Endgame climb up the ranks of the top grossing movies ever since it came out. I literally have a tab open to the webpage for it on every device. 
Also, have already see Endgame twice in theatres and am dying to see it again even tho I know my heart can't handle it.
2:08 I was like "hold on somethin's up" and then i thought "oh he has eye makeup on" and then I realized his entire face was blue
The only thing Avatar will be remembered for is all the Na'vi porn and cosplay that has been made since it was released. That's literally it.
HEY NO ENDGA- oh I forgot they lifted the ban
jack, youre missing something, Avatar was FILMED IN 3D but endgame was only POORLY CONVERTED AFTERWARDS
it's at 2.5 billion now so we're not far off
What can you say when Avatar 2 will be released.
Just saw endgame for the 5th time.. and i Don't plan on stopping...
AWW YEAH AGREED!!!
HEers THe MuTHEr FuCckin TEA
Avatar was riding off James Cameron‚Äôs rep and the fact that 3D was blowing up back then.
Its just another good action flick, nothing special.
Endgame won!!!
Jack please fix sonic trailer
Avengers : Endgame should be scared of Godzilla vs King Kong.
brb imma buy 200 million endgame ticketsüòù
YES SHARE THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!
I own an Avatar shirt, it glow in the dark.
It looks like the cover of the Great Gatsby.
The last hour is a literal movie masterpiece. Enough said
Avatar has been with us for almost 10 years, I haven't seen it once and don't ever plan to.
Jack...... with all those giveaway bot accounts posing to be you, why don't you do an actual giveaway competition of Klondike merch for fans who support #WatchEndgame #BeatAvatar ? 


It's an idea.
I swear, I got an avengers endgame ad as soon as this vid ended...legit!!!
Already beat avatar
Blue Zoe Saldana vs. Green Zoe Saldana
"Is endgame the best movie of all time? Yes." I'm sorry John, but weren't you the number 1 emoji movie fan?
If you watch Endgame only once, we'll only love you 6-900.
UPDATE: Endgame is now the 6th highest grossing film of all time. #WatchEndgame #BeatAvatar
Purple is way better than blue, cause its blue and red together, that's twice as many colours as blue. #beatavatar
Guys don't watch Endgame it has alot of Endgame spoilers.
BEEP BEEP ENDGAME IS NOW THE 5TH HIGHEST GROSSING FILM OF ALL TIME #WatchEndgame #BeatAvatar
What even happened in avatar i don‚Äôt remember the plot at all
I don‚Äôt know whether this is satire or not... I‚Äôll watch some Endgame well I figure it out.
This.....was deep
Jack I‚Äôve seen endgame 4 times
Instructions unclear, bought tickets to see Avatar 2 in December 2020
Yes, Jack‚Äôs films yess.
I honestly really like avatar
I dun care about the blue people. I just want endgame on the top
1:32 - 1:40 ----> THIS.
We all know that Shrek 5 will beat both of them.
Tobias Funk√´ has left the chat
Just got back from the theatres, watched Avatar. Thanks for the recommendation John! I really enjoyed it!
Someone's gonna write a transcript of this video and post it on r/copypasta.








And it's gonna be me!
2.50000000 COME ON WE CAN DO IT.
Jack:
"Is Endgame the best movie ever? Shakes head like he's saying no Yes. It is."
Only 500m to go I think!
Endgame beats Avatar
Avatar 2 beats Endgame
my parents forced me to watch avatar on thanks giving
I think everyone knows the Doki Doki song. Well, me and my obsession, instead of saying Doki Doki, we say Loki Loki. Does Avatar make you do that? No
I literally forgot about that movie, I actually thought people were talking about the last air bender.
I read the title wrong, Watch Avatar, Beat Endgame.
YES wow automatically subscribed
Seen it 3 times üòéüî•
Avatar: I'm the highest grossing film

Endgame: hold my beer
2.3 billion 
12th May 2019
Shrek 4.5 vs Avatar vs Endgame
WHAT DO U MEAN SHREK IS THE BEAT
It‚Äôll beat Avetar by the end of its run. I‚Äôm doing all I can to make sure it beats Avetar. I went 9 times already and plan on going more
#WhateverItTakes
Jack: *says endgame is the best movie*
Sonic the Hedgehog: YOU DARE TO OPPOSE ME MORTAL
Endgame is now first
But for real who‚Äôs hyped for the avatar sequel‚Äôs.
Death to blue niüÖ±üÖ±as
Watched Endgame 3 times infinity war 6 Times loving it
Avatar really didn't deserve to be the top. Avatar wasn't a bad movie necessarily, it just didn't have anything special to be the best.
My school is taking us to endgame after PARCC testing. My school is accidentally helping endgame beat avatar
Oh wait...but both are from Disney
Shrek 5 will crush both
YIAY question :other meanings of YIAY.
This feels so weird because I can't tell if Jack is being serious or not..
Guys guess what Tony stark is actually iron man * MINDBLOWN *
I will guess your age

Take your age
Add 1 to it
Then subtract 1
I really liked Avatar, but it's way down the list compared to the MCU and Endgame in particular.
I love you endgame 3000
Jack: says that Endgame is the best movie


Shrek: Hold up there buckeroo
Already no. 2 üî•üî•
Gone with the Wind is actually the highest grossing film of all time when you add in inflation.
i agree, i was so confused during the movie but it was still so fucking amazing
I‚Äôm literally wearing the same/a similar captain america shirt.
I wore it to school today and someone said ‚Äúthe first avenger!!!!‚Äù 
So yeet, that was a little bonding moment
I've never seen avatar and I have no reason to.


I'll #WatchEndgame.
Even Titanic is higher then Endgame but that will end soon
You can never tell when Jack‚Äôs being for real or sarcastic üòÇ
Already did. I'm not gonna spoil myself a second time
Remember when Jack uploaded daily:(
Thor:BRING ME THANOS


Black Panther: get this man a thanos
Yeah Endgame is pretty gross i can confirm
I did my part
You proud?
I'm blue. I'm offend!
So... you want Endgame to beat Smurfs?
0:46 Yo why you gotta make it a blue thing...
I want to see it like 18 more times this week
Endgame is so close and it has been only one month more or less LET'S GOOOOOO
i've seen it 5 times and im going to watch it 5 more just fore you jack #ygseveryfriday
We getting close were off 400 mil right now from the goal!
Avatar, this is your end gameüòé
I have seen endgame 5 times üòÜ
My mom thinks avatar is better then endgame
what should I do
I agree wholeheartedly but they are making avatar 2 which is set to release 2020
Thor played Fortnite and wore crocs
Hulk dabbed
Beautiful film
Sonic will be Jack's new Emoji Movie. You heard it here first.
Frick you jugsflams, I'm gonna get hired at a movie theatre and close all Endgame theatres.
"Is Avengers Endgame the greatest movie of all time? Yes" üòÑ    perfect
Lmao,what is uploading?
Fix Chris Evans bio (Captain America) #Fixbio
I'm gonna see it for the secon time today.  I can't wait <3
Finnaly someone speaking the truth on my wave lenght
endgame is at second place now #cool
But like people say,"Legends never get defeated" sooooo
watches endgame
buys another ticket
Employee: back again?!
Me: I could do this all day
Not to be mean but AVATAR IS AMAZING
But John, I've already seen it twice, and I'm going to Ireland on the 18th so I have to save my money. I don't know what to do!!
Endgame vs Avatar is basically Pewdiepie vs T-Series with older people
I SAW ENDGAME!! üòäüòÄ ON FRIDAY!!
I really rethinking my subscription after finding John makes more tiktoks frequently than YouTube videos
I saw Avatar and I liked it it was a good movie but I will most likely never watch it again until Avatar 2 comes out so I don't get lost on the story
Use to watch the old school jack




Alexander good content!
If u still fix flags




Can u fix Montenegro's flag? U could add Milo djukanovic
I realized that 
Stan Lee never saw the ending of the avengers

:(  RIP 3 legends
And I'm still waiting for the endgame in four words YAIY
Cmon guys lets go watch it 2 more time!!!
I think the reason Avatar made so much is that the tickets were way more than regular price. At least it was at my theater.
ok yeah you convinced me i‚Äôll see it a third time
if he makes a video without a sponsor, u know he‚Äôs passionate about endgame
I second this
Endgame has no replayability. It's the kind of movie you watch once every 5 years. I'd rather rewatch Avatar
Roses are red
The earth is not flat
During endgame,
thor turned fat.
endgame is pewdiepie and t series is avatar
Purple man will overtake blue man
Now second highest grossing of all time... #itshappening
THis is straight up just a promotion for endgame lol! was expecting some trolling to come
THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO
Wow...you make a good point

Instead of watching dumb blue people we should be watching scary purple people with God complexes!!!!


Love you 3000!!!
My favorite part in endgame is when rocket racoon eats thanos ass. Very suprising but it was worth it
are we gonna talk about the fact that Jack's missing a tooth??
I know this is satire but it's so cringeworthily accurate
Endgame is now the 2nd üëèüëèüëè #watchendgame #beatavatar
The Dark Knight is best
Jack's only serious video . It worries me how serious this is.
I will waych endgame today:DDDD
i support this full heartedly
rewatching endgame coz of this video.
Man I watched Avatar when I was 9 and I liked it. I tried to watch it this year for a second time and I was bored out of my mind, gave up after 20 minutes.
I don‚Äôt know what to say Jack. You are definitely my favorite tiktoker, pls do a Sanic review dad
So I want Endgame to surpass Avatar too but... you don't know what you're talking about at all. 


First of all I want to comment about the "name any character from Avatar" video. I don't think it needs to be said, but if you think about that for even a second you'll see the concept of that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. A few points:
- Endgame is about the characters, whereas Avatar is about worldbuilding. Naturally Endgame's characters are easier to remember. 
- A lot of the "character names" in Endgame are literally their own mnemonic devices. Iron man is the man made of Iron. Captain America is the guy who is the captain of the team and wears American colors. 
- Endgame's characters have existed in various media forms for many decades. Avatar is an original story whose characters never existed before. Most people in the world were able to name "Peter Parker" before Endgame was even conceptualized. 


So yeah, that comparison is dumb. I'm just shocked you decided to make an entire video about it.


Next, I want to dispel this stupid notion that Avatar's only success is its tech. Its tech was huge and important for its success, for sure, but a huge reason why is that it complemented a revolutionary and unprecedented level of worldbuilding in film. Yes, the characters are simple and only really move the plot, which is also simple and basically yet another version of Pocahontas. That's not why the film was 3 hours. Most of that time was spent establishing Pandora. Showing its species interact. Showing the Na'vi culture - the mating rituals, the values, the language (which by the way was a real language created by a linguistics PhD, if you need a clear idea about just how much detail was put into the world). Showing the vegetation in detail. Giving us a good idea of what the terrain and geology was like, and what it felt like moving around on it. It was unbelievably fleshed out and felt very real, which, for such an alien landscape and world, is nothing short of a feat of filmmaking. 


Unfortunately worldbuilding isn't really a surface level concept, and isn't talked about much, so people like you who just want "fist-pumping moments" and can't look deeper don't get it. It's not a category in the Oscars and definitely doesn't stand out as much as a story or characters. It's really just a niche hobby. 


If you need proof that Avatar's worldbuilding was an astounding success and that your claim that people only cared for the 3D tech is completely wrong, Google "post Avatar depression". That's a thing that really happened, and even Endgame didn't affect people that much. 


Overall I think Endgame is the better movie and what it achieves in culminating a 22 film franchise is amazing, but I'm not gonna lie - I'm kinda happy that people like you won't get the satisfaction of Endgame surpassing Avatar's earnings adjusted for inflation, or even come close for that matter (inflation is something you failed to talk about in this video by the way, but at this point that's not surprising).
I watched Endgame for 6 times already
JUST WATCHED ENDGAME COOL THANKS
My grandma has only watched like 3 marvel movies, not including infinity war, and she absolutely loved it!
WOAH WOAH WOAH!
slow down there buckaroo!

Endgame has Fortnite so automatic win
I‚Äôve done my part, Iv seen it 4 times
Endgame will beat Avatar and we will be happy
better reason: watch endgame so that zoe saldana will be in both the 1st and 2nd highest grossing movies of all time.






i'm not even a huge zoe saldana fan i just think it'd be funny
We need to make EndGame the highest grossing film for Stan Lee. This is the legacy he deserves
This is the greatest video of all time

I have never seen avatar, and I have seen endgame 3 (almost 4) times.

Didn‚Äôt you say The Emoji Movie was the best film ever made?
Avatar is only blue people, while Endgame has got: Blue people, purple people, green people, and even  raccoon people.

This is the kind of diversity we should expect in cinema. #WatchEndgame
1:35 July 28th 2017, you said you'd never forget
Zoe Saldana is box office gold! Just paint her and she delivers.
I‚Äôve only seen 3 MCU films(including Endgame and it‚Äôs pretty good.
The dislikes came from the blue people
1:20 oh come on endgame isnt that great
Endgame was alright

Going to see it again Sunday with my fiancee. Already saw it once solo on opening day
Are we gonna forget that, adjusted for inflation, Gone with the Wind is still by far Highest-grossing films of all time?
Endgame can never beat avatar not when avatar has such iconic characters like blue gamoras and big tree
When marvel sponsors you
I can't I hate MCEU... I  am DC.... So I wish Avatar
I‚Äôve seen very many Marvel movies recently I am eight and I‚Äôm going to see you today!
And this didn‚Äôt even inspire me #no offence
Edit. I think this might spoil it a bit again no offence
1,854,769,700 dollars.

That‚Äôs how much Gone With The Wind made, adjusted for inflation. 

Will ‚ÄúAvengers: New Game Who Dis‚Äù beat it?

My boyfriend and I already watched Endgame twice in IMAX and I'll watch it again next week with a friend, not because I want to contribute to the box office and make it number 1 but because it made me feel the love and care that Marvel Studios put on to all the characters I grew up on reading in the comics, especially the OG6. It's just a wonderful experience to feel like you are a part of their journey. xx

Just to be clear, watching this video made me want to watch Avatar for the fifth time... but I have also see Endgame twice.
I don‚Äôt think the smurfs is the highest grossing film of all time
Longest 3 minutes of my life!

Wait.. are you forgetting emoji movie ?
I had watched it 5 times hope it passes avatar
Why should we care about Endgame beating Avatar when Shrek 5 will beat 2 of them combined.
I enjoyed Avatar more than Endgame though :3
James Cameron: chuckles im in danger.
I love your serious demeanour. I hope to see more serious videos like this one. I totally dig it!!!
Your reason seems petty ... I love it 
Time to see it for the 4th time.
I love how out of the top ten highest grossing films ever, 5 are marvel films
(And I thought he was joking about Avatar be the highest- HE'S NOT. I don't know how to feel about this)
Why isn't there a FlareTV like livestream for this
I agree
I just realized that if Endgame becomes the #1 highest grossing film of all time, Zoe Saldana will have been in two highest grossing films.
Either way, Zoe Saldana wins.
I never seen avatar ::)
Lets all do a challenge to watch Endgame 3000 times each in cinemas
#WATCHENDGAME  #BEATAVATAR
Avatar has replay value.  And some of the scenes in that movie still gives me goosebumps. Endgame has the same effect. Why hate on avatar. And secondly avatar 2 will beat the record anyway.
if any movie should beat Avatar in the box office it should be Endgame
I watched endgame before watching this because I feared it has spoilers, but now I will watch it again upon request
agree
Totally agreed.
Don't worry,  I will. :D
This is the realest video jack has ever done, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier about it.
Omg end game is the best movie ever that means its better than forrest gump. shashank redamption, braveheart , titanic, the dark knight etc please open your eyes.

Someone forgot about the Emoji movie when he said that Endgame was the best film of all time.
I mean it‚Äôs possible for Endgame for it to beat Avatar but it‚Äôs also a possibility that Infinity War can beat Avatar üôÉ
Watched endgame 2 times
I never enjoyed avatar because they never played im blue when introducing the blue people
Whatever it takes

Well i watched endgame the day it came out so if people annoy me I‚Äôll threaten to spoil it for them üòàüòà
You should rewatch Avatar.
I don't know what Avatar was about though. Blue People Aliens and military invasion right?

"Is Endgame the greatest movie of all time? Yes it is."


What about the Emoji Movie and Shrek? Care to explain that, John?
Sponsored by marvel
Just saying U BETTER INCLUDE ME IN #fixbio ALSO IF U SEE THIS IT'S @RiggedRaspy or Search RaspyRigged
Um its at 2.5 billion now btw
Hell yeah!
How much does Marvel pay you for this?  If they don't, they should.
I actually want Endgame to win, even though I think it‚Äòs at best an almost decent movie - but it‚Äòs representative for the long and mostly consistent run of these Marvel movies.
Avatar slander? LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO
I played that Batman vr game for 15 minutes a while back..haven‚Äôt touched it since
Why does it always sound like Jack is joking? Even if he's not?
We all know Shrek 5 is going to beat Avatar and Endgame.
already watched it 3 times
Bro that's do deep...
This video right here.

We all know the superior blue people aren‚Äôt the Avatar. 







It‚Äôs the smurfs, but only if ur not counting Aang
1:35 
Shrek 5: am I a joke to you
I‚Äôve never seen avatar
John wick 3 is going to be top 1
The difference between the 2 movies is that Avatar had no well known lead actors, Endgame is full of big celebrity actors (and superheroes that we all enjoy watching). Also, people went to see Avatar for the 3D movie experience, but we watch Endgame for its action and to see our favourite superhero. 
Action movies will always be more fun to watch imo and with the amount of lead actors in that movie, I‚Äôm sure it will top Avatar. 
However, Avatar was the movie that used new mocap technology, Endgame is just another cool action-superhero movie.
I WATCHED IT BOIII
we did it
I love this 3000
It's already 2nddddd
It actually bothers me that Avatar is still the number 1 highest grossing film of all time. Endgame deserves that spot. 

Avenge the fallen!
I love you 3000 üåß
Avatar is as dead as Iron Man in Endgame.
3000 agree
I watched end game and I didn't seen parts before, but I don't regret it it was the best film
Wow that's so racist for blue people, how dare you
Have mercy for Nebula
Im not supposed to give my opinion, BUT
Korg playing fortnite already has more cultural significance than avatar incredible
Wtf Jack...  just watch avatar again, and then you will see how good a movie it is üòÇüòÇ
thank you my dude
Yes, but can you kidzbopifiy the whole endgame script?
this is gonna sound crazy but never have I ever watched a marvel movie, nor dc.
Watch Endgame beat Avatar
Avatar was so mediocre I never understood why it made so much money
You also said ‚ÄúGreatest Movie Ever‚Äù about The Emoji Movie. Remember The Emoji Movie, Me neither.
My favorite part of avatar was 






Woah there buddy. 
This could have been an endgame spoiler. You need to be more careful next time.
The game really makes you feel like batman
2nd place!
its 2nd now btw
I‚Äôm going on a date to watch Endgame with my girlfriend in a few hours!
Did you know that Aquaman drowns in Endgame?
"Ending to..." Yes, ending. Definitely. Next Spider-man was a hoax. Phase 4 is a lie. Honestly though, hope Avatar gets destroyed.
I donated my blood in exchange for a ticket and walked twenty minutes to the theater (and back at 2am). I smuggled in my own concessions. We all have to give our best effort, even starving college students who wished their parents still payed for them to watch superheroes.
Staircase door dies in Endgame.

Ok. I‚Äôll go watch it again.

OK Jack how much did Marvel pay you
Either way, zoe saldana wins
IT'S #2, JACK
Avatar doesn‚Äôt have Fortnite or dabbing so it automatically loses
Hot take: I enjoyed watching Avatar more than Endgame. Not saying it's a better movie. They're so different that they're hard to even compare. I love them both but for very different reasons.
I've seen it 3 times and I'm gonna go see it 2 more times tomorrow
I have not seen avatar
Why does Jack sound like Christopher Walken
Did you know Shrek got pregnant by Donkey at the end of endgame?
The only thing I remember about Avatar is that Sigourney Weaver's character died, and that I didn't like that. Oh, shoot, did I spoil Avatar for you? I guess you'll have to watch Endgame instead.
I did my part.
how did avatar gross that big? wut da hell! #BEATAVATAR
0:07 You mean 9 years. 





I have to be pedantic
snap endgame is now exactly 2x more box office revenue than avatar
I‚Äôm gonna watch endgame again. Is it worth another 12? Yeah.

Tell me, was there a single drunk fat god in avatar? Didn't think so
I have a confession to make. I was 13 when Avatar: The Blue People was released in Theaters. I loved it, it was a window into an alien world of epic proportions that sort of played into my Call of Duty obsession. I wore an Avatar shirt around for a good year afterwards and own the special edition DVD case. All this being said, the movie has absolutely no rewatchability or much charm. But what it did do is push CG to a point that wasn't awful. I'd argue some of the breakthroughs the movie made, play into how the Super Hero movies (Marvel specifically) were able to pull off so much epicness that eventually led to End Game. This rabbit hole pretty much leads to me agreeing that we've been ready to move on from the Blue People movie.  
1:35 HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THE EMOJI MOVIE LIKE THIS
"Do you want the blue people movie to stay number one?"
That sounded quite racist, John.
"Have you ever seen someone wear an avatar shirt?"
No joke, I am wearing one right now. RIGHT NOW!



I still agree, watch endgame.
Would you rather have a movie with characters you dont know the name of on top or purple nutsack chin with a shiny glove
Sorry JOHN you made a mistake in your video you said that endgame was the greatest movie of all time, you should know this is incorrect the greatest movie every created came out on July 28th
I rate avengers endgame: certified fresh
"The character development is astonishing as seen in the movie when hulk dabs, and Thor unleashes his fearsome menacing and brave personality by confronting players in fortnite, those were the highlights for me, everything else was ok idk 10/10."
SPOILER WARNING!!!!






Thanos brought Black Panther so he can obtain the n-word pass aka the Black Stone. Black Panther took this opportunity to say the n-word right in this Thanos' face and thus, erasing Thanos from existence (and yes, the time stone couldn't save him because the n-word is beyond the time stone's power
You traitor. How can you ditch The emoji movie?
I watched Endgame 4 times... I love endgame 3000(^„ÄÇ^)

Dont mind me, just waiting for Jack to dive into the Sonic trailer..
Watching Jack talk about something sincerely really makes me love him 3000. #nohomo
Yes please. 
Sorry, but Avatar was NOT that good. 

Just please... please change which #1 movie is going to be shoved in my face for the next decade.
I love that Jack took the time to make a video about something that affects all of us. Do we really want blue, 9-foot-tall, space cats to be more popular (financially speaking) than The Avengers? Of course not. #WatchEndgame #BeatAvatar
Let's be honest, the only thing that can beat Endgame and the MCU as a whole is a 3 hour crossover between the Emoji Movie and Shrek

Thor needs to be completely rewritten for this movie
Hulk x Banner needs to stop
Thanos turned into your typical bad guy villain.
A rat saves the universe
Ur forgetting about the new sonic movie, endgame will rule for a month at best
It's so strange tho that, personal views aside, Avatar was a standalone film with no enormous franchise backing it up (unless you count Cameron's name as a brand by itself) and wasn't a sequel, yet it skyrocketed to the top of the box office and has stayed there for a decade. Endgame is the grand finale of such a huge series of 22 films and THEN it might emerge out on top, that too not taking inflation into consideration...
Going to see it again this weekend

I REALLTY did not like endgame.It was a huge mess.
We did it boiz
Btw given that it's been out for 18 days and has 2.24 billion so far, as Thanos would say, (I)t is inevitable. Given the regular life time of movies staying in theaters, roughly 2-2.5 months, it will easily break 3 billion.
Let's wait for shrek 5

Oh and Zoe Saldana is in them both. Don‚Äôt forget that
Wait is this a green screen? That's trippy!
The only issue is there are so many movies that need to be watched before you watch Endgame. Opposed to Avatar which is the first of it's series
this is a cause I can get behind

Believe it or not, I think Jack may not like Avatar.

Morgan loves Avatar like she loves her mother, but she loves End Game like she loves her father. Let us all be like Morgan. 

Love you daddy 3000.

You are correct!

I‚Äôve seen it twice
lol watch for mcu fanboys thinking Jack is being serious here
jack, this is such a good video! you should make more videos where you share your opinions about subjects that interest you or about what's trending! it would be so cool to watch you share your opinions in the fashion you create your videos! it would be relatable to many viewers and enjoyable to watch!
Zoe Saldana is in both
You have switched over to the dark side. We were supposed to help The Emoji Movie beat Avatar!
Planning to watching again in the next three days
Will #WatchEndgame on my bithday
I wang to see this movie many times
#buyavatar
I bought my entire high school graduation class tickets for Tuesday. We're gonna watch it three times, hahaha
The best movies never make it to the box office
I loved Endgame. I am planning to see it again this coming up week! #BeatAvatar
#watchendgame

the next pewdiepie vs T series war
Endgame Part 2: Thanos Farms the World - will be number one. Duh
1:33 ‚ÄúIs Avengers: Endgame the greatest film of all time?‚Äù * shakes his head like he is going to say no * ‚ÄúyEs‚Äù
Ultron comes back and kills thanos
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE EMOJI MOVIE
You know what this means? When Endgame passes Avatar, it will be superior to Avatar. Disney already has an Avatar area in Disney World. WE NEED AN MCU AREA
Superman dies in Endgame and then Batman loses his powers.
Sorry to spoil
zoe saldana wins either way
Whereas Disney owns both.
curiouse where is ad...
brb gonna go watch avatar
Emoji Movie, Man I am the worst movie ever.

Sonic The Movie, Hold my Golden Rings.
Avengers Endgame is a perfect masterpiece and a really amazing conclusion to the MCU's infinity saga. I rate it 10/10. It's the best Comic Book Movie and Marvel flick in my opinion and a really great film. This deserves to beat Avatar as the biggest selling movie at the box office. Nobody can change my mind about that. Even if it has a few flaws and isn't the best comic book/marvel movie, it's still on par with The Dark Knight, Logan, Captain America the winter soldier, Avengers Infinity War, Captain America Civil War, Spider-Man 2, Guardians of the galaxy, Spider-Man Homecoming(my personal favorite don't get mad lol), and Iron Man. Endgame is nearly perfect and exceeds all expectations. A few words describe this film: Epic, Shocking, Emotional, Funny, Heartbreaking, Badass, Inspiring, dark and serious, and Tragic/sad.
I‚Äôve never even seen Avatar
getting close!
the new pewdiepie vs t-series
This video made me want to watch endgame for the 3rd time just for it to beat avatar :)
Hey Jacksfilms I was wondering if you could do me a favor because my good friend Stanley Watson is leaving and I would really appreciate it if you could dedicate a video to him. Btw he was the one who introduced your channel to me and many others.
People went to see Avatar in the Cinema that time, because the 3D was new,only to realise that the story itself was just a sci-fi version of Pocahontas
#watchendgane #beatavatar
Should I watch avatar?
Whatever it takes, Jack. Endgame has absolutely earned my money
Endgame is better 3000 than Avatar .
#WatchSonic #Beatyourselfafterwards
I kinda like avatar
Just me or does Jack have a twin in the new Hi-Chew commercial?
Seen it twice. I'm disappointed.




Should had watched it more times
10/10
I never seen avatar
Did my part
#WatchShrek #BeatAvatar
I do look forward to those four Avatar sequels E X C U S E Y O U
My mum has that exact same t-shirt
I really want endgame to beat avatar. Its really too close too win or its too close to lose. 

I predicted after it stop at the theatres it will be 2.8billion plus or it will reach 3billion dollars.
#Content stealer
Yeah because they need more money!
Forgot Endgame.. ‚ÄúSonic the hedgehog movie 2019‚Äù is where it‚Äôs at


That‚Äôs what‚Äôs suppose to get the number one spot baby
Honestly I'm going to spend my hard earned money on film that lacks a certain mode of transportation.
it's 4th now
Im un s using it you no make more yiay
You look like an Avatar
plus green zoe is better than blue zoe
YEEEEEEEEES
We did it!
Wtf is avatar?
How is Avatar the top grossing movie? Not once have I heard someone say it was their favorite film. Sure, I've heard people say it was a "Great movie" or a "classic" but never once a "favorite movie." #confuzzled
0:05 I‚Äôd rather have Titanic at the top (it‚Äôs one of my favourite movies)
I just asked my mom to name 3 avatar characters and she said.  ‚Äú.... avatar, young avatar and old avatar‚Äù then I said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not the only person in the movie‚Äù and my mom said ‚Äúoh, I thought avatar was a girl‚Äù
You would look good with fake lashes
4 million away. It's gonna win.
I've seen it 3 times already... I still want to see it again
If end game surpasses immma end my game
I never saw Avatar. Nobody ever gave me a convincing reason to watch it. I think I'll watch Endgame a few more times though.
RIP live
I don‚Äôt like avatar
"We did the math. We did the math and the math said this wasn't possible. How is this possible?!" 
....Never question the power of a fandom my friends.
This is one of those videos where im not sure how much is Jack serious... Oh boy
Just bingewatched a bunch of old videos. You should do a sideburns crew reunion thingy. Miss those days man. But that's not a criticism, it's just nostalgia. Love your new content and still watch regularly.
More then emojy
Wait till Avatar 2
Lighting McQueen kills Thanos at full speed
I love you

ENDGAME WAS THE WORST MARVEL MOVIE
Unpopular opinion but Infinity war was better
Avatar: The Last Airbender > Avatar
IRON MAN DIES
You're mom the gay.
Let's be honest the only reason Avatar is so high because of the 3D gimmick. Give the number one spot to a film that deserves it
Whatever happens Zoe still wins big time
#sponseredbyMARVEL
Is this such an advanced level of sarcasm that he's actually serious?
You want Zoe Saldana to beat Zoe Saladanana movie
I can confirm that i have never seen someone wearing an Avatar shirt.
Who else is here after 9 11?
yea #WatchEndgame and i did
I WATCHED IT TWICE!!
r/hailcorporate
Jack doesn't fully realize Avatar's replay value because he's clearly never seen it high on psychedelics
Yes dad
Avatar tries to be inevitable, but can't be.
As of 5/12/19, Endgame is only $300 million behind Avatar. And only been out... 2 weeks? Half a freaking month and it‚Äôs already #2 in terms of highest grossing film. I think Avatar needed its entire run in theaters to get to #1. üòÇ
I‚Äôve seen it twice and still want to watch it again
I saw endgame 7 times already and I'm planning to see it at least 3 more
yes YEEEEEESSSSSS
Inspiring message
Avatar sucked
I‚Äôm going to go with my friends this week
Endgame: Beats The Avatar
Shrek 5: hold my beer
Unpopular opinion, I like Avatar, it‚Äôs actually my favorite movie
I CHECKED WE'RE ALMOST THERE HULK DAB GO SEE IT
Its 5th now
I guess I'm the only one who's been waiting eagerly for Avatar 2 ;-;
I‚Äôm gonna #WatchEndgame again so we can #BeatAvatar.
I really want this to happen.
Avatar sucks
Yake sooolleee
I thought that the Emoji movie was the best?
I can‚Äôt watch endgame cause my city doesn‚Äôt have a theatre #RIP
300 million left...
Hey Jack!!
Where's the Sonic the hedgehog trailer review?!?!?!?
#WatchEndgame soldiers
Why does everyone care about grammar in the comments lol
But the avatar attraction in animal kingdom is very good.
My dad loves avatar and then we watched endgame and he never watched avatar ever again lol
Watch Infinity War before Endgame, really made me understood that 3-hour long movie.
I can support this message.
Marvel make up 5 of the top 10. Not bad hey
But if a combat system was added to the Batman VR.........
Yeah boi
MrBeast: I bought 100,000 tickets to Avengers: Endgame to beat Avatar
Whatever it takes
Avatar is the T-series of movies
yaaaaaaAAAAAAS
I wish.
Seen it three times. I‚Äôll do it again.
DO IT JACKSFILMS RAISE AWARENESS WITH YOUR FOREHEAD
end game lets go
Hail jack
They're both ehh
Boy oh boy I just can't wait for those next 4 avatar sequils
Hi Jack
This Is so embarrasing......
Well it beat Titanic, almost there, I've seen it twice, I'll probably see it at least 3 more times and pre-ordered on stream.
this angryjoe movie reviews channel now?
Alright, I'll go watch Endgame a 7th time. You've convinced me.
#WatchEndgame #BeatAvatar
#WatchAvatar !
in the end of the day the winner is zoe saldana
Avatar has nothing so memorable..while endgame gives us so much of good memories..black widow sacrifices herself,iron man too,captain lifts Mjolnir,Hulk dabs and many more.
Jacksfilms: I'm sick of a movie with blue people being at the top
Nebula: Reality is often disappointing
Captain America looks like a bird just stole his hotdog
#watchendgame I love it
guys only 10 million left
I think you‚Äôre forgetting that Shrek 5 is in the making, for sure it will be the highest film.
Today's fact: Gravity changes how much the person weighs on a planet. Mars' gravity is lower than earth's, which means if you weigh 200 pounds on earth, you'll weigh just 78 pounds on the red planet.
Are those values in real or nominal values? If theyre real, what is the base year?
I wanna just say that Jack I hope I made you proud because I had to do a report on an country in Asia and I chose Nepal
The new Pewdiepie vs T series
So he‚Äôs saying Endgame is better than Shrek? üòí
We will. Whatever it takes.

The Russos: Whatever it takes.

Chris Evans: Whatever it takes

Robert Downey Jr.: Whatever it takes
h3 parody please?
Avatar was a huge dissapointment for me and i‚Äôm a huuuge Marvel fan so #watchendgame #beatavatar
Avatar has joined the chat 

Endgame has joined the chat

Avatar has deleted the app, forever
I‚Äôm probably gonna watch it like 4-5 times in the cinema
Endgame: We beating Avatar today bois


Detective Pikachu and Godzilla: ‚ÄúWe about to end this whole films career‚Äù
1:36 the emoji movie has left the chat
I kind of agree but I think there should be a better movie to beat avatar then endgame. I don't hate endgame, I just think its mediocre
PREACH
Avatar: We are the highest grossing movie of all time!
Endgame: I'm inevitable
Is Avengers: Endgame the greatest film of all time?
#MOOD I mean I grew up on Marvel. Avengers is the first movie I saw twice in a theatre. I try to keep all my ticket stubs to every movie. But I never even saw Avatar. I remember my uncle saying the effects looked great and hearing a bunch of people saying it was weird and New-Agey. That's it. It has no right to be #1. Endgame is not without flaws (ahem, Thor's mischaracterization, lack of apocalyptic fallout per kids taking selfies in a cafe or playing fortnite on X-box, Ronin being crammed in, etc.), but Endgame has earned the right to be #1 for so many other reasons. The  massive casts, the huge scenes, the quiet beats. The fact that some characters are seeing each other for the first time in 9 years, canonically, 4 years from our perspective--and they still remember their past. Yeah. The massive fandom exists for a reason. I saw Endgame 2 weeks ago, and I still randomly burst into tears thinking about the complete arcs of Tony and Steve, I still marvel at Natasha's sacrifice. For a reason.
no
Thanos‚Äôs chin is like you with your forehead
Basically what we‚Äôve learned is that Zoe Saldana is the best.
Omg you hate smurfs. You're a smurfist.
Avatar was traaaaash
I‚Äôve watched endgame twice
So it takes 21 movies to beat 1 movie and people are boasting about the same...
What has this world become. Avatar was an amazing movie
Jack: I want Endgame to beat Blue People so Badly!!
The Smurfs: Are we a joke to you?
It's already grossed 1.7 billion
I don't like marvel
I honestly thought I was the only person to care about this I would literally check Box Office Mojo just watching the movies shift
Avatar has no replay value? Hell no. I watch it regularly. Boy oh boy I cant wait for those Avatar sequels.
I think the new Sonic movie needs the same Jacksfilms treatment that the emoji movie got. MEME IT UP PLS
i don't like marble though
Same.
Why do I hesitate reading spoilers when I have already watched the movie...
I also want space back to the future! to beat space Pocahontas!
Is this the ‚Äúproject‚Äù Jack has been working on?
Went to the previews last Thursday and just went again today. Theatre was full at the previews and about 3/4 full today so it's still going strong. Considering seeing it for a third time.
This is like the new Pewdiepie vs T-Series
Avatar has 10 year highest grossing and everybody ILL it's been for to long . Eeeyyy titanic was 13 years
I want endgame to beat avatar as hard as Chris Brown beats his wife
did I just watch a 3 minute ad for endgame?
And either way, Disney wins
When the trailer for avatar 2 comes out, it will get people hooked and people will buy the 1st movie and watch it (maybe again or 1st time if their new and just got hooked from trailer). And if it takes over 10 years to develope a sequel from James Cameron, it better be good as the 1st or even better. But then again....who know...
Thank you

Lol but can you name one

Jhon:Endgame PERFECT FILM OF ALL TIME
Entire fanbase: shrek is the best film ever

Somebody forgot about The Emoji Movie



You've dissapointed us Jack. You really let us down.

Endgame was the first marvel movie she saw
Jack: "is endgame the best film ever? yes."

The Dark Knight and The Godfather: "am I a joke to you?"

Endgame: Hold my hammer

When End Game is in cinema's for a week and

0:45 nah you don‚Äôt gotta worry about that. Endgame has Blue people too
Jack is this the really big project you were talking about?
Jack: I‚Äôm taking time off of Youtube to work on bigger, better projects.

Also Jack:
You interrupted her before she said ‚Äúfrom the ground‚Äù
Alexa! what is the average male forehead
NOOOOOOOOO
My alexa got set off at whole volume while my family was home.
Your dogs made you feel self-conscious again?
Roses are red
Blue is the sky

Stop doing this, Jacksfilms
Let Erin host YIAY
Well this is the big project
But he has a smaller one in his pants
Jack is slowly turning more and more into one of those 10-30 second comedy channels
Jack!
Where is the Sonic The Hedgehog trailer reveiw??!?!?!!!!
By Jack's reaction, I'm assuming he's 3.6 inches too short
Bruh I was watching this top volume with my dad in the room

he heard everything and is looking at me with a face of pure confusion
My Alexa went off and my parents could heard it üòîüëä
THIS SET OFF MY ALEXA THAT WAS NEXT TO ME AND IM PROBABLY GONNA GET BEATEN NOW THANKS JOHN
Little did we know the big project was in his pants
"Im gonna work harder on the bigger projects and improve the videos"
"Alexa, how much is that in a human unit of measurement?"
it will be a cold day in hell before i stop laughing at this
Why did he stop making videos regularly. I miss my Jack content. I sometimes lay in my bed screaming "ME ME BIG BOY" ... TURNING off my lightswitch  and on again hoping to see shrek 5 in cinemas June 28 2029. But I cri everytim thinking about me not getting any Jack videos
ALEXA! Have you seen endgame?
I just found it interesting that he had to specify "male"...
god damn it you set off my alexa in front of my little brother
Chill guys he said he is gonna make some sketches not just big projects
I bet Jack made this video so people's Alexas would go off
Jack why, my Alexa heard you and answered...
My Alexa heard and replied at the same time his did I-
this is going into my totally real "good videos" playlist
Quick question.
Where is my dad?
Jack, help!
People keep saying I have a big forehead, what do I do Jacky Nacky?
Finally. I‚Äôve been waiting for this ‚Äòbig project‚Äô you‚Äôve been working on and I‚Äôll say....
well this project isnt very big
Once I was talking to my friends about YIAY and they were like
"... don't you mean LWIAY?"
And I'm not friends with them anymore.
Great big project......must have taken a looong time to makeüòÇ
guys, I think Jack lied about the size of his "project"

"The average male ..." as opposed to the average female ...


Makes perfect sense. Perfect.
Damnit Jack, my Alexa answered right along with yours xD
Insert unoriginal big project joke here
Well boys, I guess we all found out what the big project was all about!

This is the big project he‚Äôs been talking about guys.
Man that project was small not big ;)
Omg read the description I looked up the user on tik tok it's legit help
Hey Jack. Really liked the video. Stoked about the project you're working on ^^
Bless Jack for capitalising his tags
Me an European: How long is 3.6 inches in centimeters? *Checks on Google*
Me: NOOOOOOO!
This is the quality content that takes weeks to make I subed for
The description makes this gold
Ah I can see this was the "big project" Jack was talking about on Twitter.

Edit: Damn it I'm too late to the party
Apparently, this "big project" is smaller than 3.6 inches
The quality I subbed for...
Just played that in my room, and my Alexa heard the question and responded, making my dad walk in mad ü§£ü§£
It used to say 2.2 square miles
Big project with small things
Sounds like your "project" isn't so big.
They played the audio of this clip on the Elvis Duran Morning show this morning. I was mad that they didn't give Jacksfilms any credit. I texted in the show and told them who it was and to give him credit but they didn't. :(
Jack almost beating 

TikTok you will always cone back to me
wait seriously?
wait SERIOUSLY??!
This is what i expect from a dude like jaksfmls
When you said you were going to work harder and improve your videos I wasn't expecting you to go to this extent, you have excelled beyond my expectations.
Guys, you should tell Alexa, "Alexa, execute Order 66."
I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
Oh ok




Nice to know
Hey Alexa, can i ask you a personal question?
When your forehead is longer than your pp
The thumbnail just screams ""iT'S HIGH NOON""
Every Boy saw the flag video and now every BOIII is here# poker face
Oh this must be your big project. This is way better than that YGS 100 garbage.
You guys remember when Jack would upload videos every week? Those were the good ol' days
I was hoping alexa would say: 
‚ÄúJust a little bigger than yours‚Äù
Umm i think you made the title wrong...






It should be ,,BIG PROJECT''
...
Me: listen to this mom
Mom: listens
Mom: DAFUQ +!!
I was watching this with full volume and my Alexa responded..
Bro, you look like THIS MAN in creepypasta btw
Hell yeah!!!! Above average!!! Checks google to make sure - "3.6 when flaccid"
Me- NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Who else had it max volume next to their mom?
just me?
:(
i watched this with my alexa in the room
My Alexa heard this video and blasted it at full volume for my family to hear
Happy Days
1 inch equals 12cm...
Finally the big project released but by the looks of the video it isnt that big ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Thanks for likes bois !!

Thank you for this episode of Fortnite funnies! Really enjoyed it.
This is the small big project you were talking about all along?
WHAT THE HECK HE JUST PLUGGED HIS TIKTOK IN THE DESCRIPTION
You posted this on tIkToK already Jack
My life right now üòÇ
Ohhhh so this is the "big" protect he was talking about
I seen this on ur twitter
I cannot fathom how talented you are as a creator. Thank you for making my day.
The big project is probably related to YIAY Live. Also, you have Tik Tok?


I have left the chat in complete and utter shame
When you find out you're 0.001cm above average.
This big project isn‚Äôt very big if ya know what I mean..üòè
original content is what i found
MINE WENT OFF TOO, ITS MY MUMS

WHEN WILL YOU STOP COPYING LWIAY?!
The quality of his content is getting better every video.  I'm excited for the next masterpiece! :)
Your videos have improved so much. I'm proud
No guys, It's a SMALL project!

Not big enough

This video turned on my Alexa speaker and she also answered the question
Well the project was not as big as Jack thought
You were on the Elvis Duran Show. The radio show they played your video lol
Thank you for making my Alexa go off and confusing my family
Damn. I was really excited about the "big" project and this is all you have.
When Alexa confirms there's no 'Big Project'
This made my Alexa turn on and it said that in unison
I can confirm this isn't fake
wtf
nice
Ohhh I thought it was 5".

When I checked Google it said that it's 3.6" when shrunk.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO MY ALEXA AND I PLAYED IT FULL VOLUME
legend has it he is still no-ing
Personally I think this is a smart video. About 24% of his sub count has watched this and even if he doesn't get paid by YouTube (he still might) this is easy exposure which leads to more viewers watching his stuff anyway.

Dear Jack
I'm 12 and going to try to perform at Carnegie Hall for Piano. (By doing an audition)

WELL THIS IS THE big PROJECT HUH
Welp, I guess this was his "big" project
Your "small" project

Surprised half this video wasn't a sponsor. Rare!
this is like when people upload a video from tik tok thats just random and dont fit in




oh wait thats we as a video
The description is equally funny
This is the content I expected from you, johnsmovies
Watch JackAsk episode 17, 2 minutes, and 28 seconds! we're only 500k away
Jacks Forehead: exist

Me (quoting Shrek): I think he‚Äôs compensating for something.
I can easily agree with that
He- he- hello? Jack we miss you
This is the content we've been waiting for
why did I only just get the notification for this video now
My volume was all the way up and my parents were in the next room. I have no regrets.
But they probably do.
Working hard there jack
well there's the good start of my morning. thanks.
Jack being a cancer for 13 second.







Before you start hating me, cancer is his zodiac sign. Pretty fitting right?

Nice
I expect a normal video, and then this happens.






I'm so proud of this community
This was the big project?
I didn‚Äôt realize my Alexa was on full blast and it heard that and it replied lol
My echo dot was right next to me and it said the same response right as the video did
This is it. This is Jack's magnum opus.
should‚Äôve said ‚Äúbigger than yours‚Äù
I FORGOT I OWNED AN ALEXA AND CLICKED ON THIS VIDEO ANYWAY
nO MY ALEXA WENT OFF
My AlExA AnSwerEd ToO
I think mine is bigger in Fortnite than REAL LIFE!
Srry jack i stopped watching u for a while because i was too busy watching  JENNA MARBLES'  DOGS
Is it me or is YIAY becoming weekly?
jack is copying lwiay
poor dude.
big project comment
They said the perfect video isn‚Äôt possible...
I was promised fortnite funnies
Alexa Just Gave You "The Talk"
I love that ‚ÄúNOOO‚Äî‚Äú at the end.
Did anybody else‚Äôs Alexa answer the question too....?
Looks like the big project is going to be below 3.6 inches long.
Me: Alexa how long is the average forehead?

Alexa: the avrage length of a forehead is 2.5 inches

Jacksfilms: 
wait, you have a tiktok?
When Jacksflims is featured on Z100 and you just scream
Heh it's my lucky day of
I was right next to my mom thank you
This is not a big project it is a very small project
He is way too underrated
But what about the female one?
Nice... alexa memes in 2019.
MY ALEXA HEARD THIS AND RESPONDED IM DEAD
She is wrong.
It is 2.3 miles
this turned on my alexa. at NIGHT.
0:12 sorry this is just for me
Lmao ok ok ‚úåüèæ
big project isn't that big I guess
Yesterday, I asked you: Why would you make this, John?
When your forehead is bigger than your project
THATS QUITE BIG
üí∏üçÜü•§ That was a get paid get laid Gatorade joke get it
Wait, no way it's only 3.6 inch (9.14 cm). I always thought it was around 5-5.5 inch (13-14cm)
our alexas were synced, jack.
When it's 0.1 inches shorter.
Can't stop watching also I am dead by government
this video is brought to you by crunchy roll
But the real question is 








‚ÄúHOW LONG IS THE AVERAGE MALE RULER‚Äù
It‚Äôs actually 3.3^2 miles
I was sitting beside my Alexa when he said this, and my Alexa heard and gave me an answer. Good thing no one was around me
this big project isnt lookin to be very big
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ WHAT????
I almost dropped my baby niece because I got this notification
Great content by Jacksfilms
MY ALEXA WENT OFF WHEN YOU SAID THAT AND THEY BOTH SPOKE IN SYNC
good work john, making the same quality as usual, my only wish is that it was a bit   l o n g e r .
best video I've seen in a long time
Quality content, as expected from forehead man. Good show.
and this,
is why im subscribed
Big project......




More like little project
Well, now i feel good about myself.
This triggered my Alexa.
alexa did jacksfilms upload a video
Alexa: Yes
Me: OMG CLICK CLICK
Me me big project
who else‚Äôs Alexa went off during this video i know im not the only one
you should have made it 10 minutes
my alexa listened and also answered this question
Sadly I saw this on TikTok
Top 10 Descriptions
Damn it, my Alexa was also activated.
Stick it to the man!
Best video on this channel.




Never mind this vid is only second best (can‚Äôt forget types of farts)
Just received a notification thanks YouTube
Yay! Mine‚Äôs above average!




Wait a second aren‚Äôt I a girl-
My echo answered his question in perfect sync with his echo
You know how in infinity war, thanos are spaghetti for 20 minutes. Well in end game, thanos ate spaghetti for 34 minutes.
So close, yet so far. Maybe next time, champ!
This should be the trailer for alexa
My Alexa responded to jack and synced with his alexa
why did you have to specify what gender??
He literally set off my Alexa and my mom heard thanks Jack
You could've asked anything.
Virtually any question, and this is what you chose.
Goddammit, John.
that's a really quick question
Damn guess I'm closer to being average than I thought.
the big project is his tiktok-ALSO make the "i dont really get tik tok do you'' thin--- wait no dont it's going to become a trend
i watched this and my alexa responded to it
Alexa can you play Despacito

Alexa: Sorry I don't play dead memes
Just checked, this is actually what Alexa says.
When he finally messasures Erin
Jack: Ah shit, here we go again..
Did you have to specify 'male'?
Best video of 2019, no competition.
Beautiful! Absolutely stunning. Don‚Äôt you all see? This is a metaphor for life. Also probably no sponsors this week.
I have this on loop
Omg I played this in the same room as my Alexa and both mine and jacks went off at the same time
YouTube removed my notifications from you so I missed amazing content like this.
Today's fact: Baked beans are actually not baked, but stewed.
They always did call me the One Inch Wonder back in high school
This man does not have a magnum dong
mine is divided by 2
I see this project going really well
More "Can you shrek it" type of videos pls its fun
Why wasn't Jack snapped when Infinity War came out?
#Relateable







So sad it‚Äôs true üò¢
Jack:there is a really big project I am working on.
Also Jack:*makes 13 seconds long video*
game theory told me it was five
I thought you were big smoke for a second
Alexa: Hmm I don‚Äôt know that
im gone for a few months and now he has tiktok
Oh man, only 3 inches short of avarage!
not the content we need, but the content we deserve x
Ffs Jack this is such a small project, MISLEADING >:(
Jack you would need a microscope to see yours
need one of those in your bathroom jack.
Cool fact but also slightly unrelated: the average amount of arms that a human has is less than 2
I was here before the title changed
Alexa how old is jacksfilms
0-0 -> p-p
I love the scene in this video where








Edit: I actually spoiled the whole plot of endgame here but I felt so bad so I decided to edit it. Go see the movie it was fucking amazing
I bet his is like 7 inches long that's why he's freaking out
Why jack this made my Alexa go off
HAHAHAHAHAHAH THANKS I HATE IT
This big project is incredible and better than expected, good jobüëè
This is all I ever wanted :'D
Ive never laughed like this for a long time i-
My Alexa synced to this
ME ME SMALL BOI
Do a video more often!
Only the early squad will remember when it was called "quick question Alexa"
I'm so glad he specified 'male'...
You activated my alexa
My Alexa answered at the same time
See you all in the Instant Regret Playlist
Laughs in centimeters
OMGüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ0:13
Jack set off my alexa
God bless you
Jack you know i cant follow you on ticktok because It's banned in india, check your privilege
You bloody set my Alexa off too
Weird I literally just had this conversation with a friend the other night. LOL.
So, your big project is to extend your... actually I‚Äôm gonna stop right here
My Alexa and my mom were in the other room when you said that. I can no longer open my phone in public lol.
It‚Äôs about 64 Iron ingots
Perfectly cut screams
Wow, I wonder why nobody sponsored this video
JACK!!! JENNA HAS ANOTHER GARBAGE DOG !!!
this made my Alexa go off
I like how he felt the need to specify "male" pen*s.
I was happy, for a split second  god dammit and then I saw this in my recommended and remembered your channel exists. Keep it up bro you make me constantly loose my motivation! (It means you‚Äôre entertaining)
So THIS is what you‚Äôve been working on.
I‚Äôve seen this on twitter I believe
G-guys. It's me Jack.


Taking a long break to make quality videos


B-b-big project haha yeah
Legends says that if you‚Äôre first 
This is so sad, Alexa play Crab Rave
Me:   4 inches
Me: ready to be mildly pleased
Legit thought he'd ask the length of Endgame considering it drops this weekend haha.
Jack what have you done? My Alexa went off and my parents heard it
"I'm gonna work on bigger projects guys"
im so glad we get to see the hard work and effort you put into ur videos with this
So i'm early for once and this is the content i totally subscribed for.
‚ÄúAlexa, where‚Äôd my dad go?‚Äù
Heck yea, im above average at at least something! My parents will finally be proud of me!
This is the content I subscribed for, thank you
Ok, hear me out on this one. I think Jack is trying to say that he's having a child. Thats what this video seems to be about. A "big project" is coming, and we haven't seen Erin lately. Baby confirmed
Fans: *wait entire week for a video
Jack: Here's a 13 second video!
why did i click on this
I skipped Avengers Endgame to watch this over and over again. Worth it.
Having expensive cosmetics in videogames kinda compensates it.
loved the idea of your big project!
Was Erins too short for your standards? 
Time for the divorce i guess.

Edit: This was a gay AND erin has a pee pee joke in one.
Alexa, tell Google to tell Siri to search for memes
At least I don‚Äôt have to look it up now
I found your Tik Tok account
Keep it at 69k likes that‚Äôs perfect
I thought this was going to be a yiay question and I was confused why it wouldn't just be in the community tab
Sort by new for cringe
sonic trailer came out and I checked to see if you made a video already
Plz fix the angling
Quality content

Got to specify that it‚Äôs male
This was on your tiktok, John. Don‚Äôt trick us

real men saw it on tik tok first
I haven‚Äôt gotten a notification for your videos in way over a month
3.6 √¨nches? That's a bit short

So Luigi is a god huh
INTERNAL SCREAMING
Did anyone else‚Äôs Alexa answer the question when he said it?
#UnderAverageSquad where you at?!?!?
"male"
Should have named the video "short question"
Wait, hold up
So this was what you were working on the whole time. Worth it.
who else saw this on tiktok
Alexa,  can I say the n word? I have all the stones..
I just realized how big your head is
this is funnier than i care to admit
Great, Jack joined TikTok now.

It‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre still in the 99th percentile when it comes to forehead length üëç
I had my own Alexa on at the same time and she picked up on jacks question too and I have to say hearing them both say the average length of a males penis at the exact same time was rather disconcerting.
I'm not alone
Mine is 2 cm.
Do You know James?
I-... uhh... Are you alright there bud?

Today, on essential informationüòÇ Love ya jack! Hi to erin and the pupposüíñ

0:11 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hmm, I guess that big project of yours isn't that big.
only 90's kids remember when this was named "quick question alexa"
Go watch jackask #36 0:59
My Alexa went off rn thanks
#Jackask is this the teaser for "We're having a baby" video
Jack is now cringey
I thought it was gonna be the CIA one
huge loss today
Yeah but its 2.6 for people that ask
‚ÄúThis Is America‚Äù
5.5' is the average, tf is Alexa smoking?
What Jeff bezos had in mind when he created Alexa
Honestly Jack if the rest if your career is just making these 15 second quips I would be 110% content with it. They're hilarious and super easy to share with friends. The format of them also seems like your style
666K views
He was going "Nooooo!" because he was too far above average.
Guys this was on his TikTok
Okay fr tho mine is like extremely tiny and really concerns me
Great project
This is comedy gold
This is vine worthy
Why are short videos so goddamn funny? xD
Its 5.4 I'm pretty sure but k
69K likes how ironic
Holy crap haha
Wait, why does he have to say male?
do you measure it when it's erect or flaccid? asking for a friend
Tiktok acc in his description cracks me up wtf üòÇ
Jack I was trying to respond to a text and went to tap the notification and yours popped up in the way so I am here to leave a comment.
Oh this is now my fav video!!!
You know what they say about guys with big foreheads....  Where do you think all that extra skin came from?
this resulted in darren breaking up with jack
Hey,Its not so bad..Mabie you exceed people in some other form.

Actually,no. Look at this pathetic mess of a man
I thought she was finna say ‚Äú2.2 square miles‚ÄùüòÇ
this is what i‚Äôm subscribed for.
Wooooooow jacksfilms has a tictok now, @jacksfilms1, I saw it in the description and literally downloaded the app to follow him wtf is my life
The fact that he had to specify ‚Äúmale‚Äù
quick question




why is this on your main channel üòÇ
like don't get me wrong, it deserves to be here, but why?
3.6 inches? Ok I only have 3.5 inches to go and ill be average
The amount of seconds tells me he is 1.3 inches.
Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs him yelling no or it‚Äôs a cut off ‚ÄúNIIIIICE‚Äù but saying the ‚ÄúI‚Äù‚Äôs weirdly

Inches ? 
What kind of witchcraft that is !?
When your Alexa is right next to your tv and starts answering this question at volume 10 to your whole family 0-0
This guy could be the new Gus Johnson...
Mine is longer
Mission failed
my friend asked for a ruler , then he asked my brother why it has a mark at 7.5 inch , i had a lot of fun with him since then 




jk
*COUGH*
Am I not average?
This is random
Male wasn't needed if we lived in 2000
Oh hell yeah above average.
beautiful
Check description
We waited a week for this...
What do you to the sonic trailer?
Uhhh Jack... do you need... help?
Well I‚Äôm actually above average (I know the measure is for flaccid) and I‚Äôm happy about this
Lmao why did you add the word male
h a h a f u n n y d I c k j o k e
Damn...
*Takes 1 week to make a 12sec video
I don't speak inches, I speak metric system
I feel bad for Jack's kid when he or she uncovers this video in the future. I can already feel the shame washing over him or her
Thought it was 6, either way
My alexa went off and now that question is gonna be in my history.
‚ÄúNOO-‚Äú
I was expecting a 1:30 of sponsor advertising.
Alexa, self destruct
Whats the point of it all
3.6 inches. Just 15 years ago it was 5.5 inches. China needs to calm down.
I‚Äôve rewatched this way too many times....
Yo why you gotta do it a male thing?
lmao i love this so terribly much
Why XD
to god man ::::::)))))
STAHP
what would it be for female
I JUST SPIT EVERYWHEREFUCK YOU
you saw your sister?

ROFLMAO
iron man dies in endgame
Did anyone else's Alexas go off then???
At first I thought this was a parody but it‚Äôs just him reacting to the trailer
Tbh I was kinda hoping for a parody not a real reaction
Why are you uploading footage of the trailer? Don't you know you will get demontitized?

I can‚Äôt believe Disney whitewashed all of the characters. I‚Äôm disappointed in them.
Not sure if him posing as Rey is a low key Forehead Joke... I choose to believe it is.

‚Äúperfect title‚Äù
~ME ME BIG BOY
Its been a week and I havent seen anyone comment about Jacks Fantastic butt scratching.
I thought this was a parody, not him ACTUALLY reacting to the real trailer!
from the makers of the emoji movie:
star wars: the sky
starring: Jacksfilms, Jacksfilms, Jacksfilms, and Jacksfilms.
We just gonna ignore the fact that he used comic sans?
0:49 "Oh, Kylo. I don't like him." same, jack, SAME!
"Rey": scratches butt
Jack: is that a death star?
Me: no that's 2 death stars
Bro this will be the best star rrrr movie ever
real fans watch the jacksfilms parody before the actual trailer
Please tell us about your skincare routine.
I loved seeing Rey run away from the Tesla.
#yaiyhero 
Name: late man
Superpower: slower time perception
Why did I go into this thinking it was an actual reaction?
"I have so many Goose Pimples!" 
~Jack Douglas 2019
That f**king laugh at the endüòÇüòÇ
yeaAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSA
And did anyone notice that when the star rrrr title came up, it played the Harry Potter theme?
I am a STAR WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
John Douglas
Jacksfilms got into episode 9?! Eyyyy, moving up in the world I see!
This is so beautiful, I'm crying. The graphics are so astounding...
You claim this is a ‚Äúreaction‚Äù, but all you did was sit there and scream consistently the whole time
Can't wait for Starrrrr: The Sky.
The Harry Potter theme at the end lol
1:30 Jack: I have so many goose-pimples

SPEECH 100
Wow it‚Äôs been so long Jack.. why did you take this long of a break Jack?!
I have to say a guy was buying your wedding sheets and you think he spent 600$
but he saved 300$ with honey
im sorry ad guy.
0:35 IS no one gonna talk about this perfect line?
Jacksfilms I‚Äôm gonna take a break 
The next day
reacting to the new Star Wars trailer
I thought this was a joke but i watched the trailer and this is spot on
Jacksfilms: YGS every Friday 
Me: today is Friday
Also Jacksfilms:
I reacted the exact same way when Palpatine started goofy laughing.
Omg, no one told me about that laughing jumpscare
Today's fact: The human nose can remember 50,000 different scents.
1:18
Jackflims : thats Palpatine !
No, thats Goofy
I like how he had to make his own trailer for this. A+ for effort.
yep, that‚Äôs right! as you can see at 0:17, i made this movie. this movie is mine. i hope you enjoy this movie. if you didn‚Äôt already notice, this is my movie. i made it. it is mine.
Star-rawrs EpisOwOde TUwU: Return of Me Me Big Boi

My physics professor was talking about angular momentum, and the gif of you with a fidget spinner coming out of your mouth covered in spit kept looping on the projector
You did it. You mad man you did it in under a day
Glad to see this is what youre putting your time into 






I really do love it tho
The dislikes are from star wars fans that thought is a real teaser or the people who couldn't buy tickets
I've never seen a star wars movie, but if it's like this, god has finally taken me into his arms.
How tf did you make this so quick?
I appreciate the dubstep Harry Potter theme in the background at 1:25



JK Rowling confirms Star Wars is gay?
Now that‚Äôs my man with a original creative content can we give him a huge round of applause .üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

Starwars Episode IX:  The Forehead Chronicles
Why did you have to spoil this trailer for me Jacksfilms? 
Me me sad boy
You gnomed me for the last time jack
They really top the budget this time
And yes fellas.. THEY FINALLY MAKING OUT!!
Not even ‚ÄúOfficial Trailer Reaction‚Äù but ‚ÄúTrailer Official Reaction‚Äù
My favorite thing in this entire video is that at the very end of the trailer the Harry Potter music plays
You know when a film makes too many sequels it just doesn't matter anymore
Star wars: ePisode nin exists
jacksf lims: its free real estate
1:02 kinda hot no homo also best trailer ever
So hyped for Star RRRR The sky
When rey was running away from the tesla killed me
Will you release an audio clip of the laugh without you saying "Thats Palpatine" so I can use it as my ringtone?
I'd much rather see 120 minutes of this
Jacksfilms: ygs every Friday 
Me: the last ygs was 2 months ago 
Jacksfilms:
Can you upload just the trailer? I really need a screen cap of the STARRRRR THE SKY end screenüòÇ
Wtf THAT WAS INSANE 10/10 on the me me big boy scale 194682pp
Why did you quit Twitter for Android? You changed it btw I know I‚Äôm hella late
I wish I could be as excited as you for a new Star Wars movie.



At least Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and season 7 of The Clone Wars will be good...

This brings a tear to my eye. Just one eye. I love Jacks' Septic Eye!!
My favorite line ever is ‚Äúoh shit it‚Äôs a Tesla‚Äù
wow, i can't belive you drove a tesla out into the desert and went to planet to find the death star for a parody! And how did you get a light sabre?
Better editing than any of is other videos not gonna lie
We talk about Jack's forehead, but what about his ears. Tbh they hella round
and the Harry Potter motif in the end title card, beautiful
‚ÄúOh Luke, Oh Leia‚Äù
lmaoooooooo I opened 2 tabs and watched the real trailer at the same time as this video, and it was fckng hilarious
Nobody:
John: I AM A STAAR WAAARRRRSSS
I love the casting choices. They are always spot-on.

That ass scratch is the funniest thing I‚Äôve seen today
#fakeFacks school was actually inspired by a prison

(Took from: The Random J)
Star Wars Episode IX but its only Jack.
My man, how much longer for the YIAY?
Is it just me who wants it to end by all of the characters putting their lightsabers in their belts the wrong way and when they pull them out they lightsaber themselves?
I Forgot I Was Updating YouTube And When It Bagan To Install The Video Got Cut At This Perfect Moment 0:36
This cwissmiss gonna be lit AF fam-dawg!
YES! This is some good old fashioned Jacksfilms right there!!
Jack: makes fun of loud YouTubers
Also Jack: * screams loudly*
lmao I love the Harry Potter theme on the trumpet at the end
I clicked in randomly and expected a legitimate reaction video, but this was 100x better. üíØ
Oh my god cant wait to see the tesla
That Me Me Big Boi part was so good
I love whenever I get goose pimples
I watch this everyday.
Why can't I buy the YIAY book??

The sad thing is that LWIAY is more popular then YIAY
I got a pure flux ad
Roses are red 
I has a smol list 
Of the youtubers I hate 
It used to be one
Just smol little T-series 
But now one more like has been taken 
Jacksfilms  has made its way up there
And they‚Äôre only two ways to get on my hated list
One you try to beat PewDiePie
And to you steal his content and take it as your own I start calling him out on what you stole from him
There‚Äôs plenty more intros there‚Äôs plenty more unused ideas 
And god this turned into me hating very fast
But stop this madness
Admit you were wrong
And allow PewDiePie his original content back
And if you don‚Äôt believe me just go check the dates from the first LWIAY to the first YIAY
Oh come on you can‚Äôt tell me completely thought of that intro off your head
You had to of found it from PewDiePie‚Äôs ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Wait I was about to say bed...
And even if so there‚Äôs no way in hell
Anyone should believe this idiot
Come on you‚Äôre plenty of ideas what else is that huge head for
That‚Äôs what PewDiePie does and he works very hard
He has so many more fans because it‚Äôs original
 And not just someone pretending it theirs

Not sure what those spliced frames are doing throughout the vid - that's not an intended gag or anything. The exported vid doesn't have them, so I'm chalking it up to YouTube bein' a goof. What a fun prank!
Spoiler Ahead:








No Post Credits. ;(

Edit: The hammer clanking and Tony creating the MK1 suit doesn‚Äôt count as a ‚Äúpostcredit scene‚Äù rather, an Easter Egg or Tribute as it doesnt have anything to do with the story/future story.
Wow. Thanos 2. You dont know how right that is.
I loved endgame but I kinda found it weird when thanos ate lasagna for like 1 hour of the movie. eh... whatever.
ENDGAME SPOILER.

  technically he's not wrong
 Also, true. There is no after credits scene but a sound
[Spoiler Alert] Wow... Turns out it really was the last one...
Thanos 2 technically did appear.
Endgame is said to be 3 hours but I'm pretty sure 2 of those hours are just the credits.

Spoiler (like legit a spoiler don't look if you haven't seen End Game):

Hey Jack,

I've been watching your content for several years now, back when YGS really was every Friday. I love your stuff, don't change a thing, literally top 5 youtubers of all time üëåüèΩ

I'm in a bit of a pickle and would love if you could help me spread the word. I don't want to type it all out here, but if you want to know more, it's all in my gofundme below



I'm not asking for money from you. I just want to get this out to as many people as possible so I can try to get out of this situation that I didn't put myself in, and hopefully prevent others from being put in the same situation.

Much appreciation if you help me out, much love even if you don't. Keep up the good work man, you're doing the world a service ‚úäüèΩ
Funny thing is one of them is kind of correct

This questions 6th time in use,
And its kinda wack
I have a theory that instead of plot revolving around characters, the way it should, in Marvel it's characters revolving around plot, the stupid way, because it only means a character does something not because it's in their nature, but becacuse the plot demands it. Look at all of the movies Widow was in and who she liked and who's side she was on in each for proof.
There‚Äôs no post credit scene

#YIAYrose A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

The name rose comes from French, itself from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek œÅœåŒ¥ŒøŒΩ rh√≥don (Aeolic Œ≤œÅœåŒ¥ŒøŒΩ wr√≥don), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan var…ôŒ¥a, Sogdian ward, Parthian w√¢r.

Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa √ó damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa √ó centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.

The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. Œ≤-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Rose hips are occasionally made into jam, jelly, marmalade, and soup or are brewed for tea, primarily for their high vitamin C content. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used heavily in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine‚Äîespecially in sweets such as barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, gumdrops, kanafeh, nougat, and Turkish delight.

Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas.

In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.

Rose flowers are used as food, also usually as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.

Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.

Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are on the Generally Recognized as Safe lists.

The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr Œ¥ŒπŒ¨œÅœÅŒøŒ¥ŒøŒΩ, "compound of roses", from ·ø•œåŒ¥œâŒΩ, "of roses") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

2:18 I‚Äôm so happy he mentioned that because it just seemed that everyone forgot that they had this chemistry between each other which was hinted throughout the movies even a tiny bit in infinity war. But it just disappeared by endgame completely and there was no explanation or conclusion. Like boi what

The best one was Homecoming. Just after Guardians 2, which had 6 post-credits scenes (I counted them) the credits for Homecoming were extremely long, and there was only one after the credits. It was Captain America giving a lecture about patience.

#YIAYrose
Flower colors of red, pink, blue and purple come mainly from the pigments called anthocyanins, which are in the class of chemicals called flavanoids (what gives plants their color). ... Because of fashions and marketing most people now image red when they hear 'roses'.

"It's not actually Jacksfilms."
"It is. Now if I press this..."

His best comedic moment and you can't convince me otherwise.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear Kirby‚Äôs signature catch phrase‚Äù
‚Äú eaaaaiieahh ‚Äù
*Censored Image*
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs baby Kirby‚Äù
New Location Discovered: Prison
stranger: literally anything
jack: I love that
It took me 3 minutes to realise he actually was on Omegle and not just an over-recording
The complete lack of context for the people and their initial confusion is beautiful
"let me see if I can get Kirby's signature catch phrase"
"...hello??"
"Love it"
All he uses is  ‚¨áüÖ±

Alexander Spammin 'em
Casually roasting Omegle fappers by calling them Baby Bowser and Baby Kirby
‚ÄúSo you see, Bowser Jr. is back in Smash Brothers Ultimate... and uh, yes, he‚Äôs a little smaller than daddy... much smaller as you can see...‚Äù
That lady at like 4:40 was definitely seconds away from whippon them tiddies out till she recognised Jack.
I love when they're like "this isn't real!" And he just calmly tries to keep going like "yeah it is, so anyway..." lmao!
5:56 I can't believe Mr. Worldwide is in Smash Bros. Ultimate, I just. Wow. Holy Wow!
Ness with his signature catch phrase: ‚Äúwhat the f**k‚ÄùüòÇ
Everyone: It‚Äôs literally a dark screen



Jack : Dark Pit







Edit: Thanks for all the likesüëèüëè
Busted about 100x laughing out loud, i love how you didn't break character and how everyone reacted, keep up the good work my man!
5:53 Pitbull AKA Mr. Worldwide confirmed for Smash DLC
I genuinely should not have laughed as hard as I did when he said ‚ÄúMario has a hookah now, that‚Äôs kinda cool, that‚Äôs rather edgy.‚Äù
3:20
‚Äúit is, now if i press this button-‚Äú

CHEEKY BASTARD
I love how that one girl just knew him as that ‚Äúguy from youtubers react‚Äù
This is the content that I subscribed to Jacksfilms for back in 1945.

‚ÄúSo as you can see, Bowser Jr. is back...‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not actually jacksfilms!‚Äù

I like how all the people with their dongs out are just made fun of by using smaller characters. Classy.
Well the graphics are a bit of a disappointment but otherwise amazing game so far!
Nes looks like Pitbull.
Mr. Worldwide joins the battle
The "what's good" kid just jumped right into it.
Jack this is gold, please do more like this!
Nobody:



The comment section:

"It's not actually jacksfilms"
"It is."
5:54 Missed the perfect chance for a "Mr. Worldwide" joke...
I think Nintendo got a little high when they added my favorite character: ‚Äúbed frame‚Äù
2:35 "It's baby Kirby..."


Uh, yeah, 911? I just witnessed a murder...
Why do you pronounce Greninja like green ninja? I was confused for a solid 15 seconds
The best parts are when he actually starts laughing xD
This must of been the weirdest thing to see lmao. Randomly in a smash brothers review using omegle.
We can tell this is actually November 2018 because Jack doesn't use the microphone held up to his face
Realisation "Ah! I'm just pressing the vape button"
Jack's just trying to do his bit but everyone's just in shock that "it's Jack'sfilms!"
bowsers jr was my favourite character in smash. He is very powerful against pikachu
bring back 3 DICKS ON A BENCH
Might just be the best Jacksfilms video since YGS 100
when the girl screamed as kirby i lost it
CENSORED

"So as you can see, Bowser Jr. is back in Smash Brothers Ultimate"
Ah man this brought a big ol smile to my face.
2:38 why does he look like an older version of Mark Zuckerberg?
Jack, it's my birthday and this is one of my favorite videos you've ever made. Thank you for making my birthday special <3
its ridiculously cute when people recognize him and jack just cant stop smiling
Hahaha why did you wait so long to show this!? I almost cried for laughing so much!! Super quick thinking on those jokes! Well done!
THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD VIDEO IDEA DAMN i loved this lol please do it again sometime!!!
Mario take a fat juul rip in the school bathroom 
Coming in 2020
"That's baby Kirby"
I actually laughed out loud
‚ÄúMUCH smaller as you can see‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
‚ÄúBower jr is back in smash and he‚Äôs much smaller much smaller than daddy‚Äù
this is such an original concept. jacksfilms is highly underrated tbh lol
Bruh he said we haven't seen the ice climbers since melee he really forgetting brawl
Wow they put in Kirby like 5 different times that's really innovative
Aw it's so sweet and wholesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
My favorite was the guy in the glasses, he had such a big smile! It was cute!
How dare you try to deprive us of this fantastic content. November? You tried, but failed to kill it, thanks.
Okay but people recognising Jack made me really happy for some reason
BRO MY COUSIN WAS ON THIS
may i please request a part two? this was actually hilarious once everybody figured out wtf you were doing. great idea, man.
6:56 wasted the perfect opurtunity to say Jigglypuff...
Is no one gonna say anything about how Nintendo updated the game to make doctor Mario look like Mark Zuckerburg?
pretty surprised most of the characters have the same catchphrase, "you're not actually jacksfilms" but oh well still an upgrade from the wii u version
I'm not a big Pokee-mon fan, but I love Greeninja.

That killed me.

Also jacksfilms: why is the fbi on my roof
When you a weeb and nobody talkin about how jack referred to inkling the girl as an anime character twice
I laughed SO HARD at the "it's not actually jacksfilms!" "It is." Part. Props to ice climbers, they made my day.
That one dude looks like pitbull
Why did you not release this sooner? It's amazing.
This is brilliant you sir are a absolute genius
I actually put off watching this for a few days because I thought you were literally playing the game - THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER.
What I love most about Jack is that in no freaking situation will he be serious <3 thanks for existing man
My fav video far, 
Fav character? Besides Ice climbers def. bowser jr
The video became 100x better when I realized what it was and that he wasn't just doing voice over on prerecorded video
this was so cute (despite the dicks)
i loved it, john cracking up is the best
When you said playing with strangers, I didn‚Äôt think you meant playing the strangers.
Sad that Nintendo cut King Dedede... My king will be missed
5:23 "So this is bed frame...Dammit."
i cant breathe holy crap
Literally one of the best things you have ever done
2:39 Dr Mario was in Smash 4. He missed Brawl, but he was still in Smash 4.
3:13 we saw the Ice Climbers in Brawl btw

3:02 they added Jordan Peterson to the roster!?
"it is"
:D :O
I was genuinely confused whether the commentary was added later or everything was recorded at the same time.
Me at the beginning of the video: "oh so he's gonna go to smash booths at conventions or something"
me when the video begins: omg guys this is so sad we need to stop piracy in the video game industry üò¢

remember yall dont copy that floppy
I haven't gotten any of your videos recommended since I turned on adblock

7:23 That guy was lit af!! I'm so happy for him.
I love you Jack, never stop
6:22 He looks like Justin Roiland and Mark Zucc at the same time
Imagine going to random strangers and saying "Wanna Smash?"
This is legit my favourite video you have ever made - please keep doing this hahahahah
‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not actually jacksfilms.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is. So the ice climbers...‚Äù
Freakin Squid girl is just an Echo fighter of Dr. Mario. I wish they had put their efforts into a new interesting character like Roly Poly Oly or Jack Black from Peter Jackson's King Kong
The people who recognized him were the best reactions üòÜ
5:53 I can't believe Jack didn't notice that was Pitbull! Nintendo added Mr. Worldwide as an easter egg, his catchphrase is "Dale"!
God please do more of these. So wholesome.
Love the new video, GamerGod88. I love how you‚Äôre letting all the 4.5 million characters in smash know that you actually like they and enjoy interacting with them. Love it. Play Minecraft.
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE IM SCREAMING
no one: 
jack: aw thats sick
"What the f*ck"
 
"There we go, that's what Ness always says."
I don't know you, that's my purse
Omg  this was amazing! üòÇüòÇ "When you play as Ness, he says his signature catchphrase 'what the "*=$^)*"lol
this is honestly my new favorite Jacksfilms video! great job, John!
"So, as you can see, Bowser Jr. is back in Smash Bros. Ultimate, and yes, he's a little smaller than Daddy. Much smaller, as you can see."
How to shame an Omegle/Chat Roulette flasher. ^^^
Shoutout to the girl doing Kirby's yell or whatever that was
bowser with his iconic catchphrase "BAZINGA!"
Wow, this was actually so good! And original, too!
I watched this video and now I'm late to church

Worth it tho
This became so much funnier when I realized what it was.
Bowser jr is back much smaller than daddy
roasted
6:32 lmao I love that this guy has like no idea what is going on but is just having fun with it
Someone should‚Äôve said Miamoto‚Äôs favourite phrase ‚Äúbazinga‚Äù

Where Is YIAY Question: Describe Android In 4 Words,
#YAIY300 I would spend it all on MINECOIN
Remember that




Wait.....
did know megamind is in smash bros 5:54
Kirby‚Äôs signature catchphrase HAHAHAHHAHA LMAO
It seems like a lot of characters in gaming have "Are you actually Jacksfilms" as their catchphrase these days.
The paid promo section got me wanting more videos of Jack's moving mouth over still pictures- like his good ol' Youtuber impressions
best video on youtubeüòÇüòÇ
This is genuinely hilarious
4:42 ok but why is there actually a hot girl on omegle
Does this mean that Jack is officially confirmed as DLC Character in Smash?
Kirby‚Äôs signature catchphrase 
AAAAAAHHHHH
Wouldn't it be crazy if Youtube demonizes or copy-strike this video for some random thing
this is the best video ohmygosh
3:40 are those ethan and hila like 20 years ago?
This is the best thing you've ever done.
5:56 bruh that's megamind
Where are my fortnite funnies jack?
The 2:50 guy is just an edgier version of mark zuckerberg
Why do all these character's taunts reference Jacksfilms? Is this some sort of DLC i can get?
I love that some of the people pick up on it almost immediately and run with it and others have no idea what the hell is going on
2:39
6:22
Mark Zuckerberg you aint slick
Anytime I stop watching his videos, he comes up with an amazing concept and totally nails it. Jack might be one of the most consistent creators on Youtube
When he brought out the console I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling 7:23
That was hilarious, thank you for posting üòÇ
5:56 Mr. Worldwide!!!!!!
It warms my heart seeing how ecstatic his fans are playing along with him
Unboxing

Girl: Oh it's not actually Jacksfilms
Jack: It is... Now, if I just press this button
Girl: üò±üò±
The Singing Fighter is the wholesome champion we need
Not only did they make the Inkling just a clone of Dr. Mario, they didn't even bother altering his character model...
4:51 is the moment the girl realized jacksfilms (the coolest youtuber) saw her chest out showing her bazongas
This video format, I like it.

* Throws this video on the floor *
I'm sure the Bowser Junior joke was the entire inspiration for this video.
4:42 Oh I know that one, its the Hoe!
5:53 And thats Mr Worldwide, Pitbull!
Should‚Äôve named this: Smashing with strangers
UM ACKTHUALLY Ice Climbers were in Brawl too
And now you‚Äôll hear Dr. Mario‚Äôs signature catchphrase!

Michigan doesn‚Äôt exist
I thought this was gonna be cheesy but I literally could not stop laughing the whole time
Thanks JacksFilms
Umm actually @6:00 that's Mr. Worldwide DLC.
‚ÄúKirbys signature catchphrase‚Äù

ah
kirby  looking hella cute out here, new skin?
Wow this lineup looks better than the roster for fortnite 2!
This is probably one of the best video that jack has made this far
PLS MAKE ANOTHER ONE
#YIAYpost A scene of Ant-Man taking a shower to wash off the purple Thanos poop.

The second post-post credit scene all the way at the end is him getting his suit dry cleaned because Thanos poop stains clothes.
5:57 Mr Worldwide makes an appearance
Every time they asked "is this real?" 
I expected him to say no
This was fucking great Jake! Great moves!
Let's hear kirbys signature catchphrase,

Girl: SQYAAAAAAAAAA

It‚Äôs so amusing watching people freak out over Jack
6:54 i love this dude üòÇ
"So Mario, uh... has a hookah now!"
PLEASE DO MORE STUFF LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!
The second guy was definitely high
This video made me really happy for some reason
How you say Greninja makes me wanna choke myself
okay but dr mario showed up twice in the video
2:39
6:22
Love the new content! I wish I could meet Jack irl :(
Jacksfilms is officially my new favorite youtuber
5:54 Literally Megamind
"Now we have not seen the ice climbers since smash brothers melee" Umm actually adjusts glasses we have not seen the Ice Climbers since Brawl Uhh check your privilege.






 That was painful to write
Those graphics are insane i might pick it up for the 3ds.
Looooooved this vid, Jack üíóüíó
What if they didn‚Äôt have a switch?
5:56 look its the real megamind!
"Is this real?"
" yes its real because Kirby-"
dark screen

Jack: Oh it‚Äôs dark pit!

Me, an intellectual: That‚Äôs mr game and watch
6:39 Damn squid girl looks really similar to Dr. Mario in the new game
You would not believe your eyes
Alexander Firefly
when will he get his sponsors at the end of his vids again?
WHEN I SAY TWO YOU SAY BROKE KIDS!

TWO!
tHiS ViDIoS SpOnCERd By MoveMENt WaTCHes
This is the kind of stuff I love about jacksfilms, this kind of content is crazy unique, and absolutely hilarious! How the hell does he come up with this stuff???
THIS WAS GREAT!
No Jack, Dark Pit didn‚Äôt make it to Smash Ultimate.
"I'm not a Pok√©mon fan."
That was pretty obvious, mostly because you said "Greninja" as "Green-ninja."
So happy you decided to release this one, even if I'm sure there were way more Koopalings than Nintendo intended.
7:32 ÀùMuch smaller than daddy.Àù Lmao
Ness... i think you mean Pitbull.
LEAVE YOU ENTSWERS IN SUBMENT BELOW AND ILL WATCH SABMISIONS IN THE NEXT EPISODE OF LWIYAYAYAYY
Jack why didn't you show us this earlier this is gold
2:42 Mark Zuckerberg??
This made me uncomfortable.






I love it.
More like playing strangers with smash bros ultimate or SBU edition
Haven‚Äôt seen Jack genuinely laugh in forever. It‚Äôs weird to see him happy
there is no smash in november 2018 lmao
6:00 someone with a bigger forehead that jacksfilns tf
This is so pure haha I love everyone's reactions
that lady just chirped @ 5:20
Everybody get ready for Mario Vape! Coming this fall to the Nintendo Switch, only on Disney
3:20 he just says it so calmly
man I can't believe Jack acknowledged the existence of dark pit
Lol you just don‚Äôt feel like making a video XP
That's one way to do Omegle fan meetups.
THIS IS THE BEST THING IVE EVER SEEN
This is perhaps one of his greatest videos to date.
This is actually a genius idea tho
You truly leveled up on your content, congrats
How to destroy someone's selfconfidance on their 
masculinity If there was really someone at the end when he introduced bowser Jr
2:38 I thought he was Andrew Siwicki...
5:53 why is mr worldwide in this video
GOD THIS MADE ME LAUGH SO LOUD
Actually...the Ice Climbers were in Brawl
It took me half the video to realize that these weren't just random videos with cleverly synced with commentary
This is my favourite video dad
Jacksfilms should collab with Gamergod88
Next episode... playing smash bros with my traumatised wife!
This was not what I expected
5:53 that's not Ness, that's Pitbull. He's the new DLC character
off brand jacksfilms
Smash ultimate?? More like, smash like!
Part 2?




WE NEED IIIIIIIIT
Jack actually mistakenly identified the mr. world wide fighter as ness from earthbound
They look so happy :3
i love that both times there was a schlong jack included jr. lmfaO
Kirby looks a little different LMAO
2:37 Bearded Mark Zuckerberg
Did he just say that we haven't seen the Ice Climbers since melee?
* brawl intensifies *
This video could probably have had a baby version of every character.
Jesus this was a great one 11/10
In America you play with strangers
In Soviet Russia you play the strangers
Please, this has to go viral, i'm laughing so hard.
Jack losing his shit at the adorable made my day 5:20
thE TWITTER FOR ANDROID IS GONNA BE A NEW SONG
Dude I think you found Mark Zuckerberg with a beard at 2:45
Why is this so weirdly wholesome?
I approve of this video, as John kept a beautiful distance from the mic
5:54 That¬¥s not Ness...






That¬¥s 
5:58 ITS MR WORLDWIDE
This new stuff you your doing is funny, your videos were starting to drag for a while
BABY KIRBY!!!!!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
@6:57

Thought Jack was gonna say "Mr. Game and Watch" 
(inb4 DK)
Ahahah this is such a genious idea, good job Jack!
6:42 Mark Zuckerberg is my favourite smash brothers character
Wait, what? It didn‚Äôt come out until December 2018
This is definitely one of your best videos
Jack's actually out here insulting a guy's "bowser".
I choked on my pringles
me me big boy
Is that The Zucc?? 2:37
seeing the people get hyped up over seeing jack was so pure and made me so happy
Are Baby Kirby and Bowser Jr only available when restricted mode is off?
lol there has to be a blooper reel of this
mr worldwide at 5:53
The Video I always wanted :]
The collective of digitally imprisoned souls that is Omegle.
This is one of the funniest videos I've seen in a long time.

It's nice to see the beta of Smash Ultimate before it came out on Switch. Thanks for the exclusive, Jack
something seems a little different about jack during the sponsor bit...
This isn't jacksfilms 

Sees. Fourhead nvm i take back what i said...
5:20 idk why but this SENT ME
i lost my mind at "oh Mario.... has a hookah now"
Excuse me, I don‚Äôt see a GameCube controller, unsubbed
This was genuine gold why was it never released
Jacksfilms, the God of improv.
"Yes, it's real" keeps getting to me
This was brilliant, Jack!
Rumor has it that Gamergod88 has an exclusive promo code for Waluigi as a playable character
5:53 Mr. Worldwide reporting live
Is that Mark Zuckerberg at 2:37 ??!!
damn the graphics are good.
Please do more of these jack! This is one of the best videos i‚Äôve watched
Jack is the only person that can make any character S Tier while Jack himself is automatically SS Tier
John kept a great distance from the mic, as he should have
Phenomenal video Jack, good job.
The guy with the keyboard LMAO
I didn't know Donald Trump is a fan of smash ultimate.
Local news:
white adult man plays nitendo switch with other adults

Effect:
Heey... Could you do "cameras vs camera's"?
The only Jacksfilms video I've laughed at??
Kinda cute, lil Mac is my new hero
It took me too long to realize that the end was a still frame that he replaced his mouth with. 
Idk if that says something about how perceptible I am, or about how big Jack's mouth is.
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen the Ice Climbers since Melee.‚Äù ‚ÄúGreeninja.‚Äù

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
YIAY: comes out
last YIAY: 2 weeks ago
why wouldn't you release this immediately it's beautiful
Jack! I need music. Do a YIAY for a song so i can do it.
Do it! Don't make me drop the meth
Do they only sell analogue?
Psssshh
Screw that i dont wanna guesstimate my time
Get back to me when they sell modern watches
Thank you for shaming the flashers!
ice climbers were in super smash brothers brawl but go off
You should've uploaded this before! Loved it
Omegle is still a thing omg this video had me in tears
This is exactly the content I came for originally
HELL YEAH MVNT WATCHES IS BACK
BEST VIDEO IDEA EVER JOHN
Today's fact: When the University of Nebraska plays football at home, the stadium becomes the state's third largest city.
Take a shot everytime he says "signiture"
Ness is Mr Worldwide now?!
HandyPen jack is back.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ I can't breathe
Jack is an earthbound fan
this is not stranger
Yo, I loooooove singing fighter, he is my main!
‚ÄúName one character from Avatar‚Äù








‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Äù
Great video, I was just bothered that you said we haven't seen Ice Climbers since Melee, but they were in Brawl
Kirby: helooo?
this is actually fantastic üòÇ
GREEN-NINJA IM DEAD
why didnt you post this in November?? ITS AMAZING
So THIS is the 3.0 update.
You sure made Dr. Mario laugh üòÇ
Best video in years. Thanks, Jack!
first video in a while that has me dying of laughter. thank you john.
4:44 Oh look, a hotie
"cosmetic remix" eh Jack, you slick dog
6:05 I didn't know numbah 1 was confirmed for smash.
6:54 Jack trying to not say "Donkey Kong"
This video feels fresh and like good old Jacksfilms
My face hurts







From smiling so damn much
He did kirby 3 times
probably my new favorite video
Title should‚Äôve been:
Asking strangers to play smash with me (GONE WRONG!) *NOT CLICKBAIT* (IN THE HOOD)
4:42
I love when he makes them happy
3:19 Aw I love this moment
This is wholesome for some reason.
It's a shame how well Jack tried to convey to each person the bit he was doing whilst staying in character within the bit itself, yet with so many of them it just flew over their heads.

Kudos, Jack. Sorry most of the human population is a dingus.
5:15 boy she scream like a god damn car alarm
The Ice Climbers were in Brawl
2:38 ZUCKERBERG???
2:37 Mark Zuckerberg?
More videos like this!
Absolutely genius
ahhhhhhhhhh this was great! XD what a great idea!!!
Best vid in a while lv u jack I'm drunk
I can‚Äôt wait until that guy from youtuber reacts reacts to this üòÇ
3:17 It's not actually Jacksfilms!
M U C H S M A L L E R
Hey does Jack use Sony Vegas Pro or Premiere Pro?
3:18 the casual "it is" killed me lmao
For a second I thought it was a serious video, thank god I was mistaken
This is amazing <3
This is by far one of the funniest Jacksfilms videos I‚Äôve seen
I‚Äôm crying üòÇüòÇ
6:40 why is mark zucc on omegle?
Me me big boy in an alternate universe: You you small girl
One of the best videos I‚Äôve seen from u in a long time
Excuse me! Ice Climbers were also in Brawl!
4:14 is that ricardo milos?
the sponsor really lets you say "I can't wait to get my big floppy greasy hands on thier watches" huh
Who we maining bois
WE NEED MORE OF JACK ON OMEGLE
5:56 
Yo why does Ness look like an npc from a ps4 game?
I want more hentai on this channel!!!
Zero suit guy laugh is hilarious hahaha
JACK THIS IS YOUR BEST VIDEO SO FAR
This is god-tier youtube content.
2:39 zuckerberg???
Oh man I'm so excited. Jack is my favourite gamer. :)
Did you just make original content? I want my money back.
WITH STRANGERS
Best video ever jack
the guy and interaction at 7:00 was beyond cute and awesome. the whole day one dance was great
IT WAS A PLEASURE GETTING SMASHED BY YOU
It took me too long to figure out the joke
5:59 pit bull was literally in the video and jack said nothing... what?
Anyone else notice he put his mouth upside-down on the sponsor?
5:27 wow shrek looks great in the new smash game
Pls do something like this again because this was hilarious üòÇ
2:42 are you sure that's not a bearded Mark Zuckerberg
This is one of the best videos on youtube
Downright genius.
‚ÄúInk girl‚Äù 





You have just shamed 10000 woomys
I read it as "smashing random strangers." Either way I will probably nut to this
This was amazing
4:40 this girl only knows him from some YouTubers react video lmao
This video is an instant classic, hands-down!
At 1:20 I realized what was happening
5:57 oh my god.... did we finally find a worthy opponent for jack ? did we seriously find a person with a bigger forehead ????????
I loved the reactions
Todays sponsor makes you look like the Grinch
you should do this more
2:35 ‚Äúbaby Kirby‚Äù
in sakurai we trust
but in jacksfilms we must



DIE
6:24 I'm your sweet baby brother griffin mcelroy
This concept is so about to get stolen and made into a challenge lmao
5:53 Missed opportunity to introduce Mr. Worldwide to Smash
And boom goes the sponsorship
I don't know about you, but I am loving these new things John is doing.
did you play smash with the singing fighter. the people want to know.
This is so good
This might be the best Jacksfilms video ever.
ok dark pit was my main and he didn‚Äôt actually make it in :(((
this is A W E S O M E
5:56 Mr Worldwide joins the battle
That YIAY live was fun
THIS IS AMAZING
This makes me so happy and idk why lmao
Smashing ultimate strangers with bros

WOOOOW Johnsfilm you seem to have a hard time telling the DARK characters apart
omg this is hilarious üòÇüòÇ
I enjoyed this like the old pms, thank you
THIS WAS ADORABLE
Kirby: ‚ÄúHi‚Äù
Me, an intellectual: ‚ÄúHELLLLLOOOOO!‚Äù
A hipster mosquito walks up to you and tips his fedora: "M'laria"

Gamergod88 is back
This is 100% good content
this is gold! why didn't you release it sooner!?
2:38 New face filters on Instagram today! This one's my favorite so far
Me: Oh, he is gonna play with other people
Jack: Plays not with other people, but other people
Me: Well, guess that's fine
This was so great ü§£
Girl at 4:42 is a national treasure
This is LEGENDARY
The fact he didn't flinch when he saw those censored images was very gay, and thats brave of you.
I love when jack just can't hold the laugh
such a good meme
Jack, why in the world didn't you post this immediately after doing it? This is great
It might be my new fav
Enjoy your Guinness
5:20 When you Smash they make that noice? I guess we'll have to play it to find out.
THE GREEN-NINJA IS PISSING ME OFF A BIT üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Looks like a 5/7 game. Will buy.
so we all gonna ignore the sponsor segment? okay...
2:40 Wow, those lawsuits have really took their toll on Mark Zuckerberg
Don‚Äôt you play with strangers everytime you play multiplayer?
Jack is a genius
Best video ever. Man you are so funny.
Do more of these, omegle is hilarious
this and the avatar video had me in stitches, really great content as usual
Aaaaand this is why Jack is the best youtuber
1:08 the graphics look more realistic than brawl
thanks for the movement deal jack, my sister will love her birthday gift!
Wait, who are those people
I lost it at the ice climbers
Dr Mario and Inkgirl are the same person
5:21 caught him offguardü§£
Best video in a while, great job bucko.
DOA FIX FLAGS VIDEO AND DO GUATEMALA
Smash with strangers!




Wait....
It took me way too long to figure out what was going on
Great Samsung Operator YAY!!!
Brawl has left chat
I was waiting for "MMM, Im Ness and I love lasagne!"
I would like to see more gameplay
Seth Rogen at 3:58
Gannondorf is the best
This is a great video, John
This is one of the best videos I've ever seen of Jack's. This was just hilarious. Great vid.
#YIAYUltimate

Gary
As a dark pit main, I can agree.
I dont think ive laughed harder in a long time
You are slowly becoming too cool for me.
I upvoted this idea knowing that you can't pull it off but god damn I laughed so much. That's the content i'm here for!
I didn‚Äôt know that Doctor Mario and Squid Girl were the same person.. ü§î
best vid ever
That's honestly the funniest shit I've seen in a while
No april fools?
6:00 It's Mr. Worldwide
So are you? Actually Jackfilms?
My favorite smash character is bed frame
THIS WAS SO CUTE
The last one really got me
Omg I love this so much
this is hilarious good job boy
when Jack's true nature shows up when people recognize him
This was such a good ideeea, hilarious concept
You‚Äôre getting closer and closer to that 10 minute mark. I believe in you
4:45 sauce pls
Ink girl üíÄüíÄ
Why didn‚Äôt you release this in november?
It‚Äôs terrific

Jack whats your main in smash bros?
I loved this Jack!!!! How do you come up with these ideas?
Best video ever
3:38 YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN GNOMED
4:41 caught red handed
2:46 Mark Zuck confirmed for smash
What he does to like buttons







Alexander Smashin‚Äô it
This may be the dumbest idea you've ever had. But, fuckin' A, it's the best. Genius!
Hearing you try to say "Greninja" is awful
I somehow guessed he was gonna say meta knight
Ice climbers were in brawl
I really wished they kept dr. Mario's signature catchphrase " Its-A me, Dr. Mario and I love lasagna"
This is so cute!
Just make the yiay vid already
6:10 is that mega mind or maybe its a conehead idk
wow smash the like button
Jack created a fan game out of nowhere
The Ultimate Legend
I love how much fun hes having, its so great when they play along
THIS WAS SO FUNNY
Mr. Worldwide 5:53
You should do this again but with something else.
Lmaoo the ice breakers are so funny
Is Jack getting is groove back? I think he is
Ness looks like pitbull
This is one of the best and most creative videos I've ever seen. Wow its realy epic
This is the content i subscribed for
Ness is all grown up
Jack you met pit bull at 6:00
6:04 actually looks like a character from a halfass game from Ubisoft with mediocre graphics
Title: Playing Smash Bros ultimate with Strangers
Me: So you‚Äôre playing online?
This is genius
All those poor people who thought they made a video with jack and never saw it until 2019...
GREEN-inja...
xd 2:58 "oh my god is that mega man?"
I love how noone has a decent camera but jack has a really nice one
This is so cringey to watch yet so funny at the same time
G R E E N   N I N J A
this rocked
2:37 There is off-brand Mark Zuckerberg
This...THIS is why he is one of the best youtubers! :D  
Seriously, I love your content.
this is quite funny!
YGS every...*COUGH*
kirby is definitely jack‚Äôs main
i love that
Great idea and execution! 5 stars
I always thought Omegle was just guys showing their junk. I guess I was wrong.
Gimme that friend code.
Um excuse me, but the last time we saw Ice Climbers was Brawl
Man, Zero Suit Samus is my favourite smash character too!
Jacks using joy cons oh no
What‚Äôs the brown girl/kirby‚Äôs @???
I love this so much oh my gosh
Green ninja epic smash character pokeymon ultimate green ninja
I laughted so much. Thank you, honestly.
Welcome back, Jaaaaaaacksfiiiiiiiiilms. (ooh)
thank u ness very cool
5:15 This is the peak of Jack's youtube career
Smooth Segway
Subtle flex
I love that he just kept talking.
That kirby girl was damn hot
‚ÄúAre you the guy from youtubers react?‚Äù
GREENinja lol
7:39 Here you can see an accurate representation of my sleep paralysis demons
the last guy was cute w jack :<
the second guy hahahhaha much love to that guy!
Disappointed no one said hi sisters
Jack uses detached JoyCons. Thats the comment
this video absolutely made my day! please more of this! if you can handle all the nude creeps that is..
but seeing so many fans or just random people playing along was so much fun!
thanks jack!
Me: Nothing can achieve perfecti-


Jacksfilms:
is this the new yiay live
M A R I O  V A P E S
No pikachu is just Ryan Reynolds
I recently found out that MVMT just bulk buy a lot of cheap Chinese watched and rebrand them and Jack up the price, so just do a bit of research if your planning on buying a watch.üëç Love Jacksfilms tho
This is his best video.
Somehow, you had a higher chance to get into this video than any YIAY
I cringed so bad at some of these, but I love it.
Mhmm... Yea i supose some people are insecure playing with strangers you dont care for, But No worries The pedophile chain being strung through privet trafficing filtering to some dagree, But to be perfectly frank i never really cared for Smash bros after melee, Controllers went to hell and made it almost impossible to Catch items being thrown at you with any other controller.

That the entry of beyonetta and the overall stale gameplay does it out.

Really liked the music box in ultimate though pawned the game like right after i completed the solo story
try asking strangers if they wanna smash, and then pull out your switch after a few seconds. now thats what i call a big epic
All jokes aside it was cool seeing all of the fans reactions
i miss omegle, Indonesia blocked it cause of Baby Kirbys
That guy at 6:54 made my day
Didn‚Äôt know ness was mr world wide
To really emphasize the junior you should only partially censor the screen
are u the guy from youtubers react??
We need to see a blooper reel
Yeesh this is creative!
How did Jack not realize that it was actually Mark Zuckerberg at 2:37?
I never wanted to main bowser Jr. but i had no choice.
i am in tears
all the dix he must've skipped
remember to take a shower
November no no no no I need that fresh good juicy content what is this Jack
‚ÄúThis is the new singing fighter‚Äù
Sis that‚Äôs jigglypuff
I have no words ü§£
Probably my favourite video
I remember when mvmt was just a couple broke college kids but that wasn't mentioned this time cuz they ain't broke anymore
Fix russian flag
Please make it a series.
7:29 omg I diedüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Yo does anyone now what sponsor jack had with mattress? Like the name of the company
How many people did you have to cut out due to someone master bating?
I need more plz
How does he keep a straight face?
I would have been really sad if this never got released. This is the best.
I've never laughed so hard
What a noob. Using joycons instead of a Gamecube controller, come on!
the biggest joke in this is jack saying mac is great and that he loves him
Make this MOREEE Pls
I know that my profile pic is bad aswell but atleast its not as bad as yours
Wait you make more content than YIAY???
And here on the nature channel, we see John Douglass in his natural habitat.
4:18 thought he was going to say Olimar
5:20 LOL XD
The long awaited return of GamerGuide88
2:47 "Its A me The SUCC"
I was really hoping someone would say "Gotta go fast!"
This was super wholesome and adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Lmao this is great
Lmao Squid Girl's taunt lol
This is one of Jack‚Äôs funniest videos in a while. My throat is actually sore from laughing.
The shock is so genuine from everyone because you go on Omegle expecting to see nudes and they just got a nerdy dude
Not gonna lie, Dr. Mario looks a lot like Squid Girl
Where‚Äôs the ‚ÄúFortnite Funnies‚Äù
You missed the opportunity when the dude was singing to say jigglypuff
Why'd it take so long for this to be released this was too funny
I was grinning for 9 minutes straight. Thanks John, very cool.
That Bowser Jr. roast, tho
JACK Y U NO DO MORE YIAY
I am very surprised that there is a sponsor.
i t
i s
Was the guy who did the mvmt ad the voice of the Grinch?
The 3 types of people that I hate: -

1. The onen's that can't spel

3. The one's who get their counting wrong 

2. The people who edit their comment.
I'd like to see Jack on omegle more
5:53 megamind has joined the server
imagine how many nerds/geeks ( including myself ) john* triggered calling greninja greeninja
Fix your profile pic
Let's Not Play's older hotter brother
John can win EVO with only low tiers
Still waiting for this year‚Äôs White History Month... you missed last year‚Äôs... now again?

Only a few hours left too.
This is my favorite video of yours now. Thank god you released. Really shows your improv skills
6:40 fool I think its Dr. Mario
I love this
THE SINGING FIGHTER IS MY FAVORITE AWWW
at least half of these people were high
Can we have strangers be the new characters in Smash Bros
Why play smash bros when you can play : Klondike adventures. Yes, that is a real app
#YAIYname2
This is like my favorite jacksfilms video
My fav is wii fit trainer. She is op because she flies







By quirkily moving her hips
When there's nothing to eat, but then your mom swoops in with a beak full of juicy earthworms: 5:20
Sure the latest smash has a lot a Kirbys
Dude stop looking at the roster and actually play my guy
$1 watches sold for $100, order yours today
‚ÄúBaby Kirby‚Äù THAT KILLED ME
i laughed during this entire video ohmygod
5:52 Megamind
I live in 3rd world country so I don't get any of these jokes
You're so dumb, I love you.
What? Is that GamerGod88?!
Kinda wish his twitch name WAS GamerGod88 tbh
I love this, it's so wholesome
Wow you must be scarred by the "juniors" you saw there
I'm disappointed that no one said 'hey I boobie' as a catch phrase. It would have been your moment of triumph.
2:46 is that Mark Zuckerberg
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS VIDEO TO MAKE ME LAUGH SO HARD THAT MY SIDES HURT
this made me weep,,, peak comedy right there
I love those creative videos of yours !
Wait these watches people sound familiar cant put my finger on it...
OH MY GOD why did this video actually have me smiling the whole way through
I clicked on this video just to see the includes paid promotion
Doctor Mario becomes inkling
more fix your flags
Bowser jr looks awesome they really nailed him in this game
5:53 MEGAMIND. There is 2 now!?
Is that Mega Man?
New smash looks great
The odd1sout sent me
It's been so long since the last time Jack made a funny video.
Wow why have you been keeping this from us

This is my new favorite video
I wasn't sure what to expect but this did not dissapoint.
this is great
I love these new interactive videos
bruh the girl at 4:42 tho
3:13 The Ice Climbers LMAO IM DYING üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2:48 ‚Äúnew face filters on instagram today, this is my favorite one so far! Nice job team!‚Äù
whoa. why didn't anyone tell  me sooner, that gamergod88 uploaded a new video?
Good God the old jack is back
This is hilarious I love this video
This was actually wholesome
Hey, I'm pretty sure MVMT is a scam, so maybe no sponsorships from them?
5:57 mister worldwide baby
Okay, well. This turned out terrible. It got old after a minute.
4:41 "I Slam that down B move all the time"
when jack finds someone hotter than his wife on omega
i almost forgot how creative jack is
It hurt me to watch jack press the button
Greenninja*
When u trying to thot but jackfilms is there trying to control you
Hey! Bowser Jr is clearly a grower not a shower!
on April 1st hes going to release fortnite funnys but keep on doing them
This is the good shit and the real jack content
This is so awkward lol
The world needed this :)
Jacksfilms: Epic Gamer üòé üëçüèª
Jacksfilms should expand into a full channel of Omegle pranks
Censored parts are literally smash brothers
Tf even is content
Release the uncensored version, John.
If ur asking why they look different now, its cause they patched everyone's looks in the new update
We haven‚Äôt seen the ice climbers since melee.
This is the cutest video you ever made
GREENinja
2:45 that guy has such a warm smile
I love the exchange with the greninja dude, he was really think that it was a prerecorded thing and i always laugh at the "gotcha" face he does when doesnt do the catchprase but Jacks says "pretty cool huh", only to be show he was wrong about that assumption less than a second later xD
This is brilliant hahahhaha
5:53 that's not ness that's mr worldwide
This gives smashing on Omegle a whole new meaning. HELL YEAH
Dude, you really showed off Kirby a lot in this video. Got a crush or something?
5:54 megamind
I LOVE THIS
I liked this Nintendo/G-Shock collab commercial. Quite creative!
Today‚Äôs other fact: there are only 2 escalators in Wyoming.
Where‚Äôs the fortnite funnies? Today is April fools day
This is rather cringy
7:21 wholesome
6:27 you call her ink girl and then later refer to her as squid girl
just subscribed to JennaMarbles
Alexander Awful Sin
Pika looks better than Ryan Reynolds in this game

Wait
Oh nevermind then
WAIT A SECOND THEYRE REAL PEPPLE AND HE'S-
Wait you‚Äôre not actually Jacksfilms are you?
Damn I'm surprised they introduced a new singing character instead of bring back jigglypuff
I‚Äôve never been so entertained THANKS
THIS. SHOULD. BE. WEEKLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey John, 2013 called, it wants its video format back!
This is incredibly cringey but still hilarious
2:42 Mark Zuckberg!
Omegle was invented for Jackfilms.
I thought this was just gameplay lol

(Anyone want to roast my channel feel free, I‚Äôm trying to make better content)
4:43 I think she's ready for a different type of smash
great content
4:41 Holy Crap, that girl is gorgeous!!!
Minus the few rando censored dickcams, this was such a wholesome video ‚ù§üòÇ
MORE!  MORE!  MORE!  MORE!  MORE!
This...THIS is why he is one of the best youtubers! :D  
Seriously, I love your content.
This is what Omegle was meant for
I lose my shit when people actually manage to make him laugh
This is funny af! Please make more soon.
5:55 that‚Äôs megamind
I think Doctor Mario and Ink Girl are related. And one REALLY cute man.
5:53 Jack has no idea that he just met the world famous pop singer, Mr. WorldWide.
Mark Zuckerburg at 2:43
I love that one girl who recognised him
2:38 It‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg
Everyone: plays with a pro con/ gamecube controller
Jack: plays with joy cons
TWO BROKE COLLEGE STUDENTS
This makes me mad
We! Want! More! We! Want! More!
Remember that time when you dressed up as a kitty üê± it was cute
Seeing their surprised faces made my day
5:55 it's actually pitbull
I thought Kirby‚Äôs catchphrase was ‚ÄúZoinks Scoob.‚Äù
this made me cry
I played super smash Bros ultimate too it's so fun
This was so fkin funny i cant believe you have kept this from us so looooong
Where's gamergod88
5:53  mr.worldwide
"it is"
When you knew this was coming because you saw the live stream where he introduced it.


Point is... follow him on Twitch
Filthy Acts At A Reasonable Price
I really wanted someones catchfrase "Bazinga"
‚ÄúIs that the guy from ‚ÄúYoutubers React‚Äù?
You know, it amazes me how you come up with some of your video concepts. This...was genius!!!
2:44 Mark Zuckerberg grown up
The second last one was so wholesome
I adore it when the people catch on and just go with it
intro music?
That imrpov at 2:34, not losing a step. At 7:29 also.

4. Edited comments
5. People asking for likes
Like if you agree
3 kirbys
I love this.
@4:42 A thot is a familiar with JacksFilms.
I‚Äôm loving the cues you‚Äôre giving them
Baby kirby :)
Going through a pretty difficult time right now and your videos never fail to make me feel better. Thanks so much Jack, and know that what you‚Äôre doing makes an impact on people that is so great.
Good for you John :)
7:52 #YIAY300 I would buy the bourbon rose watch from movement watches
Was to lazy to change the name
Alexander Hamilton

Wow. It's been a long time since i've seen a jacksfilm video this long? Could have extended it for just another minute though and it's a 10-minute
6:58 nah that‚Äôs Dark Pit
This is my favorite jacksfilms video in a while
Jack you clearly don't know what you are talking about that first guy was obviously ike not marth just look at the bandanna
Jack is g√¶
I have proof
I can see why you never released this video.
Now Jack really would have media controversy on his hands if he accidentally said the black kid was donkey Kong...
reminds me of the onetime I caught an adult youtuber jacksfilming on snapchat
This is his funniest video in a long time and it has half the views he normally gets.
5:21 ·µÉ·¥¨·µÉ·¥¨
When YIAY????
5:56 pitbull lol
good stuff, cool format. thumb in the butt.
I get an asthma attack from laughing every time i watch your videos
Love me senpai
Bowser Jr üòÇ
Did Smash confirm the 2 broke college boys who wanted to wear cool watches but were too poor to buy them so they opened their own watch company?
A funny video on Jackfilms, what is this LWIAY?
Lmao nice
Morrreeee üòÜ
It‚Äôs funny how he almost didn‚Äôt upload this video but he never doubted uploading the Me You, You Me video.
Yogurt
Okay but like, how did he not notice that the guy at 6:32 is the same guy from 2:37
"He's a little smaller than daddy. Much smaller, as you can see."
Pickle juice
2:47 is that zuc
5:52 lol are you sure it's not Pitbull
why didnt YT showed me this video?
A mixture of adorable and horrible
So awkward lol
Best episode of YIAY ever!
I T  I S
Why none of my omegles look like that 4:42
Joycon boys
The guy who sings is jigglypuff
Wow I‚Äôm so excited for this games release!
5:20 ???
Omegle is still around?
Why is no one talking about how jack pronounced greninja as green ninja? 5:25
His face in the thumbnail though
April 6th is still national pillow fight day
Honestly best content you‚Äôve made in years
Greeninja
5:20
Greeninja

Fun fact the first song that kidz bop was all star.
Inspiron

PART 2
my mom just made me the perfect grilled cheese
The YOOO yo yo yo dance was cute asf can‚Äôt lie
1:08 - that's a PewDiePie chair!
Why are there so many Kirby echo fighters in omegle smash?
THAT BOWSER JUNIOR JOKE WAS JUST PRICELESS!!!
Just for you means all the millions who watch this
6:33 that's Doctor Mario you uncultured swine
5:53 Ness looks like Pitbull
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THE NEPAL JOKES, THE EMOJI MOVIE JOKES AND THE FURRY JOKES
This is one of the best videos I have ever scene, love the reaction please do more random chatting type videos
Baby Kirby lmao
Ness looks like pitbull
Why does ness look like pit bull
XXDDDD
that wasn't ness that was pitbull
So wholesome! ‚ù§







i hate it.
DAY 1!
8:35
I loved this video, very cool
Mvmt just gets cheap chinese watches and sells them at a premium
I wonder how many penises john had to endure seeing to be able to make this video
When u want to reach the 10 min mark but can't get past 9
This is your best video from recently, I couldn't stop laughing
We want the non censored version
5:53 oh cool pitbull is in smash
i lold
This was bad
Why would I get a watch for 200 when I can genuinely buy an HTC or a Huawei which has a "built in clock".
Squidgirl?
Father
4:55 I know that chick from Tinychat lol
I'm surprised the internet hasn't found the girl at 4:47 yet
Make another episode of the Top Ten Boyz
The guy who did Dr. Mario and Squid Girl is friggin w h o l e s o m e
Back when jack didn‚Äôt sound like he was dying and taking it out on us with the rode mic.
Mm big boy gamer
2:44 Zuck
his fans wont write his jokes for him anymore so now hes branched out to complete strangers
Why is every video sponsored?
Yayyyyy! New gameplay! I love this gamer! 
Who is waiting for new Ep.132 Minecraft gameplay?

its not actually jacksfilms??!!! is it? ... noo
This is by far one of the best things you‚Äôve done I know you probably don‚Äôt wanna do smash again but you should do something else with Omegle
Big boi, gamer boi
Holy
I know this has absolutely nothing to do with Smash, but I'm about to do earth hour.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
was the girl at 5:00 animated?
6:01 looks like pitbull
I bet he was about to call that black dude Donkey Kong
GamerGod88 amirite
7:28 "Yes hes a little smaller than daddy"
Lego my cartoon remake
Lwiay > yiay
lol me
Good vid.
GAMERGOD88
Ewww dark pit I main him man fuhhh
aren‚Äôt we all playing smash with strangers because when you play online you don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre playing with
Haha cool I tried doing this and all I saw was a bunch of veiny forearms being tugged really hard by other arms. Did I do something wrong?
He's a little smaller than daddy
7:42 why he looks like the new joker?
Looks like Nintendo is taking the Bethesda route
People still use Omegle?
4:44 she was clearly trying to like have computer sex but then Jack just shows up
Don't know why you didn't upload this video earlier but awesome idea Jack! 
You are truly one of the most creative youtube channels down there and you keep making quality content after that many years.
Cheers :)
Gamergod88 is back
You should make more of these ü§£
Did you really do this on omegle?
üëç
Woods
Oh it‚Äôs baby Kirby
The ice climber's signature taunt being "are you Jacksfilms", as an insult, implies that Jack is really bad at Smash.
üòÇ
If I was connected while Jack was doing this, and he asked for a catchphrase, I would have said:

HEY, VSAUCE MICHAEL HERE
Great video
Noice
Not click bait 3 am challenge almost died do not try at home
Cough
This is the epitome of an epic gamer moment.
:)
The guy at 6:02 looks like pitbull
no
Theory: Jack is in hospital or something and that's why he's only showing an old video and his mouth






Idk I'll go now
ink girl
Jack wouldn't it be funny if you got the camgirls to show their boobies hahahaha like each time they recognize you you can just get them to take their top off wouldn't that be hilarious hahahaha
‚Äúbaby kirby‚Äù
calling all units, shots fired.
4:43 - Hot damn, since when is Jack watched by Models?! She's amazingly gorgeous!
Jack.. Thank you for this
6:00 megamind in smash???
and people say he doesn't have creative content üòÇüòÇüòÇ
6:27 That's clearly Dr. Mario, you fool!
Great video jack proud of you
This is probably the funniest video I've seen all week, if not all month
I love greeninja too
make this a series plz
I love this
this was so funny actually
oh my god is that mega man?
I remember watching this on Jack‚Äôs stream xD it‚Äôs super funny.
Greeninja
wow, just wioow-.
Jack is turning into Mr. BEAST
Yo was that pitbull there at 5:55?

Edit: Pitbull/Mr. Worldwide, sorry Jack
Title does not match the video 

Alexander clickbaitin
That girl from 3:13 to 3:52 is really attractive
I just love how confused most of them them are
The green ninja was always my favorite
@2:38
You're not hiding from us Zuckerberg üòë
Y O M A N W H A T A R E Y O U T A L K I N G A B O U T
This is the best video in a long time
This is my favourite video ever
That Bowser Jr. Joke was a perfect retort to that pervert ;)
You should do this kids,but only in my van
Zero suit is a lot better looking in this game
Dr Mario looks like mark Zuckerberg
I‚Äôm kinda disappointed they made squid girl dc edgy smh ..... üòÇüò≠
3:13 he never missed a beat üòÇ
That ness character really looks like Pitbull
5:21 wtf
Dr. Mario and Squidgirl look a little similar in this game.
Why isn‚Äôt this on trending
Do your research on MVMT watches before buying them, there are way better options for watches at that price range that still are very minimalist. Just do your research
You wanna hear something funny






The next YGS
Why does pikachu look like a redneck
i can‚Äôt help but smile like an idiot when people play along or especially when he comes across the fans
Eeh, I already saw this video a while ago live üòé
How does this even like... you know what won‚Äôt question this video just keep watching.
Ice Climbers were in Brawl.
That‚Äôs not actually Jacksfilms!

It is
This is good video.
Wait...is this clickbait?
Strangers Bros Ultimate
Why the hell didn't you upload this? It's actually funny
This sounds like a very fun game! Is it available on Xbox?
This was great.
Anyone else watched it on twitch
And yet they didn't change the title
6:35 looks kinda like zucc
This is the stupidest and most genius idea you've had so far
When you speaking to a  girl and  video chat  her for first  time and find out its not a girl 3:12
did you play smash with that last guy

if you didn't you're a horrible shithead i stg

also kirby is the best nintendo character js
gay
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big gamer.‚Äù Uses joycons
Jack: hey kid u want some sweets play some smash with me
Why do people use Omegle?????
Such a good idea for a video! would love to see another version of this
this man plays with joycon lmao
I like Doctor Mario's catchphrase best.
this is awesome... more gameplays like this please. XD
we need more of this
THIS WAS AWESOME XD
This made me feel uncomfortable and laugh too.
THIS IS SUCH A GENIUS IDEA LMAAAOOOO
This was hilarious, very clever
This is one of my favourite videos you have made in a while!
These taunts are weirdly similar
Play me Jack
This was great!
5:00 she fine af
These poor people just had their minds assaulted
5:53 Mr. Worldwide?
At first I thought he explained himself when he was connected and then cut it out, but then the girl who was freaking out came up and omg I love this video so much
If i had run into him like this, my taunt would be "John, please get a job"
...wait... are 2:37 and 6:22 the same guy?!
I like how jack met a Omegle ‚Äúnice waman‚Äù and he acted like nothing was wrong
I had low expectations.
I have been proven wrong. Very wrong.
The graphics are insane. Definitely gonna play
I'm disappointed in myself, it took me way too long to understand what going on
6:23 Why is he talking to Mark Zuckerburg
This was fucking awesome, I could watch the hell out of this as a series.
The funniest video I‚Äôve seen in several years
Jack is smashed talkin bout smash.
I did not know Ness was pit bull in ultimate
who else watch the twitch stream
Dr.Mario returns as ink girl
Mario has a hookah now
omg that guy is austin in the begining
5:20 oh i'd play her
2:38 Dr Mario kinda looks like the Zucc but with facial hair
Only 5 months late
Only you.
I really want this to be a trend and I really don't want this to be a trend.
another one plz?
4:43 damn, Kirby never looked better
Make Petscop 2

Oh

Wrong channel
great content haha one of the best vids i've watched recently in this channel :D
Man, I'm so fucking happy you changed lanes. Love this video.
This is your best video hands down.
you better add the second last guy
Not enough fire emblem characters
One of them Kirbys was pretty fine
I love how jack is so dead inside
2:41 i love his smile
10/10
My brother help someone set up their Wii u on omeagle
Why does Ness looks like Pitbull
You can only like this comment...




If you have fingers
Now that Jack is a gamer, does that mean he's ready to RISE UP against society???
You now Strangers are in your house...
If the toilet seat ist warm at a day you thougt you are alone at home!
You are the best 
And If You Are Seeing This, hope you have an amazing Beautiful Day/Night and yearüíï



I also really want to hit 45k and I would appreciate any supportüôè‚ù§Ô∏è
Who wears a watch anymore?!  Everyone has a smartphone and every smartphone has a clock.
Next you should do smashing kids with strangers
for the 3% reading this, I hope you become successful in life with everything you dreamed of, and accomplish more than you had imagined. I am a youtuber myself and I'm not asking you to do anything. but I would love to hit  30k 
with bell üõé turned on by the end of April ! THANK YOU, ALL OF YOUTUBE
The last number of the like is your best player in smash!

1-2 Marth 
3-4 zero suit samus 
5-6 meta knight ( my favorite )
7-8 mario 
9-0 kirby!
Don‚Äôt laugh at me but my husband got me this game for Christmas and I can‚Äôt figure out how to play it. I‚Äôm willing to trade it for a box of brown sugar poptarts tbh
Absolutely no clue why you didn't post this when you made it, this is amazing!
This is probably the best video of 2019
5:53. Wow! I didn‚Äôt know they put Mr. Worldwide in Smash!
4:02 looks like young Seth Rogan
3:20 was hilarious üòÇ
Not gonna lie, that black Kirby skin is hella cute
I loved this so much.  Big ass goofy grin the whole time
This video is so wholesome
7:36 enought internet for today
Cringe level over 9000
Forgot to make it a gamergod88 video
Your stuff just keeps getting better
Alright I just have one problem with this vid, maybe it was a joke or maybe it was an honest mistake, but tou said at about 3:45, "We haven't seen the ice climbers since smash brothers melee". That's wrong. They were in Brawl as well, but they were left out of Smash 4 Wii U/ 3DS
1:14 Yo! It‚Äôs Mr. Game & Watch
ahHhHhH!
üëçüëç
Hahahahaha oh Jack.
Oh
More
OMG
But Jack we need more of this. Ask people on omegle to name a character from avatar
I love how you try to make people realise what you are doing xD
The ending is a 10 outta 10
Hey Jack, what is 100 60 countries? #YGS
Omg it's the guy from Youtuber's react
BRA BOWSER JUNIOR LOOKS SICK! Its like he always says! "ME STATURE IS SMALL BUT ME MOVES IS BIG KATCHAU" Love him 10/10
i can't even begin to imagine how many guys wanking you had to go through to make this video
3:14 üòÇüòÇ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Lets-a-vape!
5:53 boi thats not ness thats megamind
LMAOO WHY DID THAT ONE GIRL SCREAM LIKE THAT FOR HER TAUNT
Why are all of the smash characters fans of jacksfilms
What was going behind the censored bar?
This is the hardest I've ever laughed from your videos
Gamergod88 is back
GamerGod88 in da haus!
Where is ygs
imma big gamer
Imagine one of these weird people fappin on Omegle and they actually recognise Jack
Ha ha funny
Damn, they got a lotta Kirbys in this game.
My favorite fighter is no doubt the Singing Fighter. Very charismatic and even has the Nintendo Switch for a dlc cosmetic!
Why wasn't this uploaded before? It's awesome!
I LOST IT AT THE MARIO ONE
ness‚Äôs catchphrase is a classic
All the people who recognised him made me SO HAPPY
I HAVENT LAUGHED THIS HARD IN A WHILE OH MY
why is the zucc on omegle?  2:38
Are we all just going to ignore the fact that Mario now blow fat clouds during his taunt?
You know the youtuber is good when you're entertained by the ads
Wot
God
Waa
I like to S M A S H.
Me me big boi
yo is that ness pitbull?
AT 5:53 IS THAT PITBULL
It's a little smaller, than daddy. Oof
love your videos but please stop promoting mvmt watches, they are cheaply chinese made pieces of crap that can be bought without the branding for just 5$. Guys if you want a real watch in that price range get a seiko
Hey Jack how do you feel about a billion views?
Much smaller than daddy Bowser, much, MUCH smaller!... I died at this üòÇüòÇ
This was incredibly creative and great improv üòÄ
2:48 6:38
its the same guy
Movement Watches? More like...POOMAN POOTCHES
This was gold!!! I‚Äôm sure you made the day of those who recognized you!!!
I thought this was gamergod88



I am disappointed
5:54 is that forhead bigger than jack's
Jack loves me too much man
This is the best
I don't understand why I loved this but I loved it
Heyeveryoneit'sme, Gamergod88. Long time no chit chat.
Hmmm Kirby‚Äôs catchphrase seems a little too high for me, but it‚Äôs cool I guess.
6:56 Jigglypuff
5:16 hahahaha
greeninja
5:20 ......
I want yaiy
Roses are red poems
I would‚Äôve destroyed you with Wario‚Äôs taunt sucker, good thing you didn‚Äôt fight me.
Jack you are a absolute mad lad
i freaking loved the video, even laughed through the whole thing dammit. great job jack !
High quality content! Keep it up
This is probably one of my favorite videos of yours!!
8:57 Jesus Christ is my favourite character from Avatar!
I... Wow.

Wow. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
this is amazing...
Who plays smash bros with two joy cons and no grip?
Damn those are good graphics. I'm really glad Nintendo went with a more realistic style
@girl at 5minutes, pls hmu
This is genius
GREEninja?!?
I hope that they don't take down the vid
This is so clever
Watching this early is perks of twitch
#greeninja
At 5:53 I thought it was Pitbull for a good 2 seconds
Why is his mouth upside down
Greeeeeeninja
Hey jack, did you see "Congratulations " from Pewdiepie, look how in 1:40, he tries to beat your lowest, deepest dab, so naive, he will never beat you
PUTA ANO TO
Holy shit I'm CRYING
Ok everyone add me so we can play smash SW-0737-1917-0493
"Oh I'm just pressing the vape button again"
2:37 MARK ZUCKERBERG CONFIRMED FOR SMASH!!!
"Greeninja"
I loved seeing this on twitch
Took me till half way through to realise its actually live
God this was dumb. I loved it.
do more of these
6:55 when u rlly try not to be racist
Hilarious
2:34 - 7:30 Why is it censored?
Joycons?
Wearing a movement watch is like being subscribed to t-series.
Lol
omg. lol.
Why
You should have found a black guy and said he‚Äôs Mr. Game and Watch
Stop copy PewDiePie!!! Arrtgghhhh!!! üò°üò°üò°üò°
Yo wus goooood
are you the guy from youtubers react?
6:09 Mr. Worldwide is in Smash?
I love how often people just play along
6:00 Boyboy westcoast?
omg wow it's the guy from youtubers react
One of your most funny original videos yet, Jack. Great job on this one.
My favorite lets play channel
this is a good video john
Second guy is hot
11/10 you mf
4:41 uhhh what was she doing there
It makes me really happy to see jack smiling when people recognized him.. :‚Äô)
You didn't friend the singing fighter did you-
Gotta do another video like this so you can meet and talk to your fans.
Movement is a terrible watch brand. It's cheap watched with a logo slapped on. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
Why on earth would you sit on this gold for 5 months?
Movement watches are stamped Chinese garbage, do not buy them.
yo cringe
MVMT are overpriced garbage. John can make his money but don't fall for their bs their watches cost 20 times more than their actual worth.
Jack just so you know mvmt buys garbage watches from Chinese companies and sells them for more.
Theory: 
The reason JackAsks take so long is cuz he has to think of an acronym for ‚ÄúAudible‚Äù each time
3:57 I like that jacksfilms isn't scared to answer political questions.
A - Ayy
U - U
D - Deserve
I - Interesting
B - Books
L - Lemme 
E - 'Elp!
"Captain Marvel was able to unlock her true powers by believing herself."

That was literally a plot point in two of the three Thor movies and nobody seemed to mind there.
2:57
Jack: what's my religion
Klondike: oof, i gotta hear this.
Wow a ripped jean? And I thought you were a family friendly channel smh
Today's thumbs up is brought to you, Jack, by completely ignoring the painful brexit question yet still putting it on screen for comedic effect.
"My religion is believing in myself until my space powers unlock."
So.... Scientology?
Okay but tbf Thor also unlocked his thunder powers by believing in himself so it's not captain marvel it's just dumb storytelling imo
3:57 well who is interested in Brexit!? We all wanna know about the cutest avenger
I feel like your slogan should be "Includes paid promotion"
"The Sorting Hat is Anti-Vaxx" - Jack Raowling 2099
I think that Audible acronym is the best one you've ever done.
in the first guardians of the galaxy they won with the power of friendship, so I don't see your point üòÇüòÇ
i watched the whole ad. now get some new pantsüí∏
"My religion is believing in myself until the space powers unlock."


Oh so you're a scientologist Jack. Cool.
Are we just gonna forget that the light switch meme was a thing that happened for way too long?
I love how Jack's videos are 60% content and 40% sponsor. (Don't do the math).
Hey Jack - 
What would happen if Shrek believed in himself?
if captain marvel was able to use her powers by believing in herself then we can apply that to thor in ragnarok as well! so she'll be fine
8 more JackAsk's until Jack has a midlife crisis!

You always brighten my day with your videos.

Jack: They give me a lot of Shrek jokes

That's incredible, not appearing on YIAY, not make a question on JackAsk, Not Ame...

Jack: oooh this one is from granday 
Boyinaband: am I a joke to you
Remember when we used to tease Jack mercilessly that he'll never have a million subscribers? 
Now the man is pushing 5 million!

Jack: These are getting harder to do.

Erin: You are getting harder to do.

i‚Äôm sorry
i love watching your videos jack but, don‚Äôt EVER disrespect g-force EVER AGAIN
I think its name should be changed to jask.
can you say ‚Äúcoxswain‚Äù (cox-in) and ‚Äúcoxbox‚Äù without thinking too much?
Noone:

Jacksfilm: Has a new sponsor in every video
"My religion is believing in my self" 

Sundae stares at jack
That‚Äôs some serious man spreading, John.
Can you make a Endgame trailer review please?
G force is a cinematic masterpiece you buffoon
I guess you could say:
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days.

Jack, we're not asking Goofy the questions. We're asking YOU the questions.
I definitely had a hard time getting through this one. Not sure if it was the energy of the video? 
You okay, Jack?
1:20 john carter is actually really good
Pfffttt, all the Avengers have to do to beat Thanos is cough on his shoulder. His mom, Karen Thanos, never Vaccinated him.
I am tripping and only watching this because Jack‚Äôs forehead looks funny on acid
Jackask is just reverse yiay

    change my mind
#jackask Can you and Erin both sing the first song that comes to mind after reading this?


Also, please bring back the Alexander Hamilton videos!!!
"I think it's cool that [J.K. Rowling] came out and said that the Sorting Hat is anti-vax."
I know you're joking.
But I can't be sure.

And that's the point.
If you really like those types of documentaries then you should watch "My Scientology Movie"
"the sorting hat is anti-vax"

I appreciate you, Jack
What do you prefer
Shrek or MARVEL
Do you get those Bible fans trying to force you into their fandom? @jacksfilms


THIS IS FOR #JackAsk

i think the best part of watching JackAsk is making eye contact with his slight moose knuckle
You need to wear a bra, Jack, I'm seein' some booby
So...



Belive in ourself to unlock our space Powers, right?
That's the best type of La-Croix. For real.
OKAY BUT G FORCE WAS A GOOD FILM-
Jack has a hole in his left jean leg, get that fixed ASAP
Jackask is getting harder because audible aren't sponsoring him often
There's so much sexual tension between Jack and that mic üò£
Every.single.time. you say' jack ask' i think of jack a** ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Aren't you gonna make a FIX FLAGS part 2
"What is something your audience frequently says that they find funny, but you don't?"

Jack: physically struggling not to say 'Literally anything'
"My religion is believing in myself until the space powers come out"

So scientology?

jack no offence but captain marvel's overarching moral for being confident in one's abilities and embracing your emotions is a really powerful and valuable lesson for kids and for everyone really - especially for women who get told they are "too emotional" and that our emotions make us weak (like yon-rogg does to carol). but i guess you wouldn't understand xx obvs it doesn't mean the same to you as it does to someone like me, but i think they did captain marvel pretty good. even if the movie doesn't end with epic explosions or idk some sorta revenge plot, doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. i think that fact makes it better and more u nique, especially for a superhero movie. but thats just a theory
Look, we only have 7 more JackAsk's until episode 99. Then we'll wait a year for an hour long 100th episode. We better start looking for another youtuber to watch for the next year or so.
2:41
Ummm, that‚Äôs horse crap and you, joji, ian, and max all know it Mr. 1 Liter of Smirnoff!!!

Jackask Live I call  royalty,s
"The pitbull song was awful" proceeds to like the video
Go to 4:30 and then pause.


The face you make when Jack doesn't do the Antman Thanos Butthole meme. (Also the Try Guys used Jacks intro for them in their latest vid 'Boink Marry Kill'.
Yo Jack how do you feel about article 13?
Do jack ask ASMR version
Not having seen captain Marvel makes the space powers joke way funnier
Nobody:

People on jackask: A v e n g e r s    E n d G a m e

No one:
Jk rowling: voldemort was actually harry's evil twin brother harold
tbh I'd love if Jack did a pitbull parody, even if it's not avengers-related. more high-effort shitposts, please
Hey Jack, why are you drinking La Croix, milk and tea or coffee?

Answer the darn question about brexit, jack.
im currently an astronomy major and i want to kill myself yah dodged a bullet john
I got an ad for a game called klondike adventures.
Jack's a Scientologist confirmed
I have seen this man in my dreams 







anyone else!?!?!?!
3:16 "You know how international star Pitbull had a song for Aquaman and it was just terrible"

likes the song on the screenshot
Technically the miles morales unlocked his power by ‚Äútaking a leap of faith‚Äù
2:59 The dog wants to hear about Jack's religion lol
Jack your thigh seem thicc from this angle.
The manspreading is strong with this one
Since the next episode will come out in a couple of months: if you could play a game for 1 whole year, what would it be
When was the first time you got "pleasantly buzzed"?
#jackask
The Sorting Hat is anti-vax. Bruh, I'm dead fam

If the Pitbull song for Aquaman was terrible, why is the like button blue?
It sounds like he is saying Jacka*s
Today is my bday 
Thx for the vid

g-force is underrated
snow dogs was an instant classic and possibly one of the greatest cinematic moments in history.
That man sit ..... nooo
You look like Adam Goldberg's character from "Dazed and Confused" in the thumbnail.
But all the avengers have won by believing in themselves again
sooooooo, are we going to talk about it or not?
Jack ask 100.  What you gunna dew?
Sick background drinks. As in actually sickening, yuck.
I wonder if it's a joke or if you actually were in the mood for milk and some fizz at the same time.
The pit bull song is a brilliant idea. Make it. Or else I will continuously post foreheads jokes, light switch jokes, emoji movie jokes and shrek jokes. Do it, you won‚Äôt.
Yeah. But Jack! Are you hyped for Star Wars: Ep 9 - Finn Awoke?
I got a 4 hour ad on this video

Thank god for jacks taste in avengers. i TOTALLY agree Thor pre-ragnarok is best
damnit, he's learned he can get us to stay for the sponsor if he uses footage of his dogs.
don't let this distract you from the fact that Mr. Krabs sold Spongebobs soul for 62 cents
*bookworms,

let‚Äôs eat*
Everyone asks how Jack is, but no one asks....


....how Jack‚Äôs forehead is
JK rowling is pronounced like rolling, the thing that round objects do.

She gets this question a lot and needs to correct people a lot

People (read assthats) tell HER that SHE is saying HER NAME wrong.

Don't be an asshat. rolling.
Lol I thought u said: welcome to JACKASSüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
hope he skips jackask 100 like completly and utterly skips to 101
3:20 Says Pitbull's song for Aquaman was terrible yet shows a screenshot where he hit that muthafuckin like button
theyre also getting harder to watch, like youve made the same "Wow this video is goofy" followed up by "Wow dark ask" for nearly all of them, we get it, youre quirky, i love you
Is NF Christian rock
Okay but forreal that was the best audible acronym so far...

Why are you sitting so weirdly
I thought this was a yiay.
I realised that it wasnt.
Why must you trick me.



Please exuse me while i go and kill myself,thankyou.
Guys YIAY 500 and JackAsk 100 are going to be a combined ultra-video (and it also includes the finale of Jack's tweet bit with his repeating tweets)
my name is Jack and WELCOME TO JACKASKS
Imagine he got sponsored by a company that sells something and his discount code was jackoff
I love how when someone asked about religion, one of the dogs (I don't know witch one) just looked at you for a while, and in the next question both of them just got out of the frame.




LOL
Are you looking forward to the new, most popular, superhero movie that‚Äôs coming out in the next month

Shazam?
hi can you do a face reveil
The acronyms were really good in this one, I'm impressed.
"then id have to write the hook"

Hey, Jack! What‚Äôs an acronym for the word audible? Just curious
1:12 G-Force is the stuff man
What are your nicknames for Jenna Marble‚Äôs lil devils
Do you have perfect pitch?
Are you excited for kung fury 2?
I will use Audible when they stock up on Well of Eternity trilogy.
1:20 aight you can talk trash about all those movies but LEAVE MY MAN G-FORCE ALONE
I have a question: Why does your mic look like a Dildo
that audible acronym was actually clever for once
jacksfilms is slowly becoming an asmr channel. Slowly
Yes John, I see you using those poor dogs to make us stay for the sponsor
Jack is getting slightly less ironic, and that's cute
Is it just me, or does the microphone make jokes less funny
Can you react to avengers end game and name all the characters like incinity war
Jack sounded like Jason from the good place at 2:41 üòÇ
Don't let this video distract you from the fact that Mr. Krabs sold Spongebob's soul for 62 cents.
I love math and space and I am scared for my future
the audible acronyms are the best <3
3:00 Doggo was like: "You Heathen!"
Can you give EXO a new meaning?
JACK DOESN'T SKIP LEG DAY!
Rumor has it that he can turn coal into diamonds with the raw power of his thighs
No one:

Jack: *Tortures himself*
he sounds like the bee from the bee movie
Another documentary for you then: ICARUS. About the doping scandal at the olympics in russia.
I wonder how long it took him to think of the Audible acronym.
I honestly stopped watching when you started using that mic
2:52 - Good lord, I thought he was gonna say "baby".
would you please stop manspreading?
#jackask
Article thirteen will make us have to type out all of our memes... so many text posts.
Welcome back to JackAsk, the show where that weird host makes thumbnails that'll make you lose sleep for days.

G force was the best movie back in the day
Oh man i am so excited for the hourlong yiay 500 and now i am more excited for jackask 100 which will also be an hour long! How do i know? I believe in myself
"Wellcome back to JackAss"
His microphone is amazing.
Isn't it kinda funny how jackask and jackass sound alike, what a coincidence
3:57 has nothing to do with the question lol.
4:12 possible cheeky Borderlands 3 reference?
1:11 gforce was good
"These are getting harder to do." --- Then stop doing these. Do something else. This is getting old.
Does anyone else feel like drinking some tasty La Croix after watching this video?
Don't worry Jack, I believe in you!








Wait... Where the hell are my space powers?!! Nevermind Jack, no powers, no believing.

Hey Jack, is Mario suicidal?
I think (this is just my speculation) that he didn't like Captain Marvel
leave mars needs moms alone it's good >:[
Can you ask pyrocinical to make petscop 2?

goddamn jack. clean those nose pores D:
I'm so glad the out of all of  Jack's in-jokes that come and go over time the acronym one stays there and doesn't get old and overused. Those always crack me up
G-FORCE IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER
Anybody else distracted by the man spreading?
I was just thinking about Mars Needs Moms the other day.
Fking spoilers mah boi
Now that's some fine man spreading
3:01 even Sundae is like "What is this dufus talking about?"
The lip smacking makes me so uncomfortable, please use a different mic set up üôÑüôÑ

4:34 same, but I‚Äôm not even watching the trailer before watching the movie

I beat you

Submit to my excellence

I am superior
I read the sorting hat is anti-vax tweet too! it was really funny glad you used it!
G force  was incredible
Captain marvel removed an inhibitor chip you nonce
the wild is lowkey an epic movie
all I know is the cat from captain marvel
I feel like Jack is getting progressively depressed and lethargic the more he looks at Jaskask questions
i love u jack (no homo, maybe)
the lip smacks and saliva noises make me uncomfortable
Have you ever watched Winx?
Anyone know wth Jack is talking about with Captain Marvel and friendship? Did- did he actually see the movie?
This might have been your best Audible acronym so far.
4:11 what were you alluding to
In all seriousness, I think Captain Marvel unlocked her powers because she decided not to let people get in her way, hence the montage of her getting back up over the years.

That, and she destroyed the thing on her neck that regulated her powers.
John Carter was good
please get a hedgehog

please
Thor POST-Ragnarok.
#jackask
Man I sure hope today's sponsor is crunchyroll
It should a like he says ‚Äúwelcome back to jackass‚Äù this stuff is hilarious and one day I want to be this funny as ayoutuber
I just signed up with Audible. I did not use your code. Byeeee
I love getting fortnite ads in front of your videos. Perfect audience I‚Äôd say.

NARRATOR:

(Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)

According to all known laws

of aviation,

there is no way a bee

should be able to fly.

Its wings are too small to get

its fat little body off the ground.

The bee, of course, flies anyway

because bees don't care

what humans think is impossible.

BARRY BENSON:

(Barry is picking out a shirt)

Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

Ooh, black and yellow!

Let's shake it up a little.

JANET BENSON:

Barry! Breakfast is ready!

BARRY:

Coming!

Hang on a second.

(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)

Hello?

ADAM FLAYMAN:

(Through phone)

- Barry?

BARRY:

- Adam?

ADAM:

- Can you believe this is happening?

BARRY:

- I can't. I'll pick you up.

(Barry flies down the stairs)

MARTIN BENSON:

Looking sharp.

JANET:

Use the stairs. Your father

paid good money for those.

BARRY:

Sorry. I'm excited.

MARTIN:

Here's the graduate.

We're very proud of you, son.

A perfect report card, all B's.

JANET:

Very proud.

(Rubs Barry's hair)

BARRY=

JANET:

- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.

- Bye!

(Barry flies out the door)

JANET:

Barry, I told you,

stop flying in the house!

(Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a newspaper)

BARRY==

- Hey, Adam.

ADAM:

- Hey, Barry.

(Adam gets in Barry's car)

- Is that fuzz gel?

BARRY:

- A little. Special day, graduation.

ADAM:

Never thought I'd make it.

(Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving)

BARRY:

Three days grade school,

three days high school...

ADAM:

Those were awkward.

BARRY:

Three days college. I'm glad I took

a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

ADAM==

You did come back different.

(Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging)

ARTIE:

- Hi, Barry!

BARRY:

- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

ADAM:

- Hear about Frankie?

BARRY:

- Yeah.

ADAM==

- You going to the funeral?

BARRY:

- No, I'm not going to his funeral.

Everybody knows,

sting someone, you die.

Don't waste it on a squirrel.

Such a hothead.

ADAM:

I guess he could have

just gotten out of the way.

(The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)

I love this incorporating

an amusement park into our regular day.

BARRY:

I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.

(Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating students)

{‚ô¨ Playing "Pomp and Circumstance" ‚ô¨}

Boy, quite a bit of pomp...

under the circumstances.

(Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)

- Well, Adam, today we are men.

ADAM:

- We are!

BARRY=

- Bee-men.

=ADAM=

- Amen!

BARRY AND ADAM:

Hallelujah!

3:34 You dont need a baldcap jack, your already going bald.
g force is one of the greatest screenplays of modern history
2:57.  So, Scientology?
Jack‚Äôs face inching into the screen next to Bad Blood was oddly disturbing
Video starts at 5:13

Dinosaur and g-force are great movies

Why do you sit on your chair so threatening like. I can feel my own spine crying.. RISE UP FELLOW GAMER
00:43 Dave from boyinaband!
I remember going to the premiere of G-Force and for like three years afterwards I still had the G-Force hamster plushys with spy gee

Jack, you‚Äòre getting older. Older. Older
Jack, you‚Äòre getting older. Older. Older
FYI, John Carter is awesome
Hey this is gonna sound like an r/thathappened post but that documentary called Bad Blood that you showed on screen? My biology teacher‚Äôs son is in the documentary because he played a major part in exposing Elizabeth Holmes. He stopped class to tell us all this. So uh. There‚Äôs that.
damn John you look like a mess
love your channel xoxo
Ok but G-Force was one of my favorite movies ever as a kid
I liked this video because of the ‚ÄúBookworms? Let‚Äôs Eat‚Äù.
John is manspreading
Jack you don‚Äôt remember the cat from Captain Marvel?
Hey Jack, explain this: if God is not real, how come my girlfriend is pragnent although we never had sex?



Oh
Did no one else hear the lip smacking at the start
honestly I like the pitbull idea, you can just do it in a really low budget  and it'd be funnier
You brought the Shrek jokes on yourself. We all did. There is no escape.
Y'all already know Jack waiting for borderlands 3 to drop to answer the video game question.
If audible doesnt have jojo, its gotta go-go
Do you need more questions? Or ideas for content?
I thought you said Jackass
Does Erin fart from time to time?
Hey Jack! I never get to see your boyfriend, where is he?
You guys aren‚Äôt ready for Carlos Ponce reading the Harry Potter books in Spanish on Audible
Another question:
On a scale from 1-10 what's your favorite color in the alphabet
You just joined a very exclusive list of peeps who can remind me to hit upvote with a clever sponsor transition.
Listen MARS NEEDS MOMS was good Jack
Jack: I want someone to ask how I'm doing

Jack: woah back off CREEP!
Captain marvel dies
But she wins later in the movie
5:21 is the best part
John carter was good you goofball! It did suffer from bad marketing but the movie was enjoyable
man-spreading
At first glance I saw "This is getting harder" and dirty thoughts began to plague my mind.
I actually really wanna hear your views on brexit
Hey Jack, is the Avatar character Jesus Christ, actually canon?
Are you happy that the Try Guys finally used your beautiful intro?
THIS IS SO GOOD
3:58 How sad, Theresa May asking advice from a like begger.
What psuedonym do you use to publish your original Audible books???
Oh btw the try guys used your intro
Why does your dog sit like that?!? it made me twitch uncomfortably. And laugh louder than I wanted to.
The sorting hat is anti vax made me thumbs up the video lol

GFORCE IS THE SECOND GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME

Yeap this song is definitely going to be made lol
ngl audible is the only paid promo i dont close the video for, just because its the classic

i love how whenever he doesn't have enough interesting footage he just splices in videos of his dogs
4:10 what happens in a few months I don't get it
grandayy is a normie not even joking
that was a good acronym
I see Jack answered that Brexit question as full as the UK politicians are capable of...
This time's acronym was pretty neat!
I must not believe in myself enough. Still no space powers.
When's da next YIAY?
#jackask what jackask question that really pushes your buttons something that makes you angies

I Loved "Dinosaure"! How could you betray me so, Jack? :'(

dayyym jack lookin extra thicc this episode
5:26 You just made me not wanna buy it lol poor Audible tried to count on you
Ripped jeans? Wow jack, I thought you were a family friendly channel. I‚Äôm unsubscribing.
But, I like how you‚Äôre still delivering good content that you‚Äôre excited about.
And smiling. Making us laugh.
Ripped jeans, smile was showin‚Äô.



Edit: But all jokes aside, you, Jack, are the best channel on YouTube by far. You, while making hilarious‚Äîand actually good‚Äîenjoyable content we can all admire collectively, always have seemed to have maintained the excitement about YouTube you showed in your early days. It might not feel like that to you currently, but we are delivered the same energy as always almost every day. You bring smiles to my face, and likely others as well, on rough days, and heck‚Äîevery day actually! Jack, honestly, I think we can all strive to be as enjoyable, creative, talented, and energetic as you have been the past nearly 13 years. I love you, bich. Everyone else probably does too.
If you are reading this

Wtf is Mars need mom's, the alien looks like Whoopy Goldberg's
4:11 oh you mean the next episode?
Its still only episode 92?
#jackask are you doing anything special for jackask 100
When do you think you're going to stop making YIAYs?

Edit: Not trying to sound rude
Who else noticed at 1:29 the tweet said Twitter for android
0:38 literally anything
Forehead Lightswitch
I didn‚Äôt know if I was more mad about how Jack just pissed off (and on) 48.11% of his Western European audience by ignoring the question or the fact that he DID - and therefore missed the opportunity of totally taking the piss out of UK. 

Then I remembered that USA has a reality star for president.
I'm sitting here, watching this video....with my pet hedgehog lol
Is it sad that the hedgehog joke got me the most? A married 30 year old, yep.
Is this LWIAY
iM hErE FoR iT

Shrek is love Shrek is love

life goes by fast

r/im14andthatisdeep
Hey Jack, I feel incredibly worthless. I feel like at this point there is nothing good I can do to fix my life. I'm jobless, have no close friends, have stopped going to college, and stopped creating art that I used to love. I feel talentless, and I feel hopeless. One highlight of my life was when you liked a tweet I posted for fix my art. Knowing that you acknowledged my art, and liked it, that was the most valuable I've ever felt. I guess why I'm writing this is to ask you, can you fix me? Can you make me better? Can you fix me? Can anyone fix me? I go to youtube to escape these feelings and thoughts, and since I know this won't get seen, this is the only place I feel comfortable saying any of this. What the fuck is wrong with me?
your testicles look huge, wow good for you
Its not that captain marvel believed in herself, its that she realised the chip on her neck restricted her power
I thought it was called jackASS LMFAO
THE TRY GUYS USED YOUR INTRO! It was so beautiful!
4:13 I hope you're talking about mario maker
His forehead honestly isn't big

Does he ever realize that we never watch the ads unless its actually cool?
‚ÄòWelcome back to jackass‚Äô did anyone else her that??
0:40 omg boyinaband!
Your audible ads are the only ones I watch.
Ogres are like onions. They have layers
Thanos gets defeted by Captain marvel saying: is this a personal attack or something? This will make thanos huddle in a corner and cry.
So SHREK?
How tf does he still get sponsored by audible?
2:57 the dog looked up at him out of curiosity

I hate when people edit their own comment, like it and reply a dead jacksfilms refence on it.

I also hate meta comments
man-spread
Hey Jacksvideos, what are your thoughts on the new DMC
#JackAsk
Would you get another dog?
Remember just because another movie did believe in yourself unlocks your powers, doesn't mean one that also does it is good or vice versa. Besides no one mentions Thor 1 or 2. That hair on Hemsworth, bleh no thanks.
Ok ‚ÄúThe Wild‚Äù was a good as hell movie ok you can fight me on that one Jack
jack you look mad thique in those jeans
Dear Sean, I love your react videos! 
Can you do a JacksFilms reacts to Happy Feet 2? Thank you!^^
Yeah, but can I use Audible on my Nintendo 2DS?

Oh yeah its my moms account im a boy
Did you just come out as a Scientologist?
HOLY CRAP JOHN DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT GROUPING JOHN CARTER IN WITH MARS NEEDS MOMS. THAT MOVIE IS AMAZING.  YOU NEED TO WATCH IT. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND.
did you gain weight :D ?
Hedgehogs are illegal in California - mostly because someone forgot to put it on the list of animals that could be kept as pets.
When in doubt, believe in your self.
When not in doubt, still believe in your self.
0:39 -  I did not know Boyinaband had twitter
I actually thought Captain Marvel was pretty good... Until Jack said that it was basically her believing in herself to unlock her space powers üòí
Wait...... DAVID
Jeeez is YouTube paying so bad that you can't even buy yourself new jeans? I don't know if you noticed but your current once have holes in them

Jacksfilms kinda looks like trevor in gta 5
His mic. always makes me uncomfortable
Cz i looks like it will fell away
How do I get more dislikes on a video?
Nooooooooooo, the mics back
The acronym.
How do you always find acronyms #jackask
do you think after avengers end game the directors will pull a JK Rowling and reveal that thano's was secretly...
2:31 What if they believe at themselves?
you can't compare G-Force to the likes of Dinosaure or Snow Dogs, it's a master piece
What's your favorite sports team?
Legends says that if you‚Äôre first 




LITERALLY NO ONE CARES
Jack axe #jackask
This episode was actually funny, wtf?
"can you ask this question again in a few months" i think we all know how this channels gonna end
Is that a furry costume in your plant in your background?
Do people actually enjoy him holding the mic???? am I crazy for hating it so much?! PLZ respond I need to know
5:11 oh god no.
Wasn't Super Size Me the biggest documentary in that genre?
5:43 Sundae looks weird sitting like that

Finally, a good acronym for Audible!
10/5 because It's really really good

Is the outline of a manboob on your chest part of the shirt design?
Jack your twitter for android shirt has elongated too far
"what's your religion?" "Believing in myself until the space powers kick in".  So scientology?
Roses are red violets are blue faces like yours belong in the zoo but dont worry your not in a cage but were laughing at you!
But are you going to strike the try guys for stealing your intro
Write a song about Thanos working at Theranos
Captain Marvel had to break through the mindfuck of bullshit gaslighting and then remove the device they were using to contain her before she realized her full power. 
Guardians of the Galaxy held hands and realized the power of friendship.
3:02 TELEPORTING DOGS üôÄ
Why that iam getting sleepy while im watching you?
5:12 üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It's a long story

Jackassk
I wonder what's Jack's opinion on parappa after this
Haven't watched any of jacksfilms' videos in a long time, and wow they've gotten boring
‚ÄúCaptain Marvel unlocked her powers by believing in herself‚Äù
Yeah, it‚Äôs not like she had some inhibitor chip on her neck or anything. If only they told you that in the scene where they tell you that.
How to make people listen to an ad they‚Äôve heard many times: show cute puppies
Hedgehogs aren't suited for home life, they die really easily :( they're cute to look at but not to own
3:31 voice break
shrek joke
When you make a YouTube video keep the ending brief, cause no one wants a video that makes you want to leave. We know that you have have plugs to share, but keep them short or we wont care. When you make a video, keep the endings brief.
#jackask Is immortality a superpower or a curse?
Bookworms lets eat
3:58 was that a joke or bad editing?
Hey Jack, how many shrimps do you have to eat before you make your skin turn pink?
3:58 why is there a different question on the screen
If Audible's service is so good, why do they make you tell them to cancel your free trial before they bill you, instead of counting on you being willing to pay them not to end your subscription?
2 dogs of the same breed and a hedgehog

hmmmm.... sounds kinda familiar
How dare you rip on Dinosaur!
Needs new ending song
Who do you main in smash
Please fix the jacksfilms profile
Are you an atheist?
If so, why do you eat babies?

DINOSAURE WAS A GOOD MOVIE GOD DAMN IT, UNSUBBED
He acted like there was someone behind the camera with a gun. Is Erin holding you hostage, Jack?
My religion is being a strong independent gamer
I haven't watched a single shrek movie.
Wait. The tweet at 3:58 is not about Avengers!
When are we getting some more sick Haikus?????? #jackask

Hedgehogs make for terrible pets
Dinosaure was fire
Hey jack why is there a Klondike store but not a Sundae store?
Hey Jack! You probably won‚Äôt find this, but a documentary I would recommend is ‚ÄúScientology and the Aftermath‚Äù. It‚Äôs a very good dossier on the Church of Scientology.
even if u cancel
Yiay please
Sundae is better than Klondike
Jack you complain that a song takes a moth to make when to you a 5 minute yiay with 2 minutes of ad  takes you a moth to make
"My religion is believing in myself until my space powers unlock". Sounds like scientology to me.
Is it bad i have seen all those lesser known disney classics?
John what the freak
My forehead is bigger than yours
If you got a hedgehog not only will the dogs kill the hedgehog but they would die from eating the needles
5:13
Jackask it better to take out the k and put an s but then you will put it back when he uploads lwiay and trise to make it yaiy
get a different mic freak
I got a pewdiepie ad......um.. Don't @ me
I don‚Äôt know what it was but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever laughed so hard at a jackask
2:34 yikes
Chris Evans if he was straight.
You are world's  worst grandma
Shrek.
Good moning
What song is playing right now?







Wait this isn't google.
Those aren't pets, they're food.

How do gay people decide who the mom and who da dad
whats 9+10
Ur upper body looks so short in this pose...
How to get new friends
#jackask Have you ever heard of manspreading?
What‚Äôs your smash bros ultimate character? Please give us a serious answer.
To answer the question at 3:58 ; for me, the hard border isn't an option. Not only would it undermine the rules set out in the Belfast agreement, but it could possibly insight a return of action similar to that of the IRA in the 90s. Simply put the delays at the border would cause problems for shipping between to countries whom already find it hard to co-exist. As a UK citizen, under no circumstance do I believe that Wales, Scotland or Ireland should leave the UK. We are in all ways stronger together. Seeing as all proposed amendments have been rejected by parliament, there are only 2 possible options for me. The first being a bill with a blue and white paper being created by parliament holistically, initially constructed by Theresa May, which contains the deal proposed to the EU; in the case of this been rejected by the EU we would negotiate with a set of boundaries being in place in order to revoke article 50 when not satisfied. The second is a second referendum, where if passed a deadly no-deal would take place. For real tho who tf actually wants a no-deal.
She didn‚Äôt believe in herself, she took of a chip. Yeah
Stfu jack planes is my favorite movie and I will fight you
Jackads
GOD
GOD
GOD
I wanna kiss the luscious lips of the man in the thumbnail
4:20 JACK IS A NERRRRRRRRD
Believe in your self should be some sort of  self aware merch
Wow, back from hubby to chubby, I see. P90X must not be working out for you.
Wait is he... is he wearing the same clothes as the last jackask...?
New idea for a movie, believing in myself till my mental illness goes away
I feel scammed, I was proud of my question
Hunny........ the dogs will eat it
Does anyone else feel uncomfortable about the ripped jeans that Jake is wearing? CRINGE!!!!
no. no no please don't make out with the mic again
Eminem venom is pretty neat
But hedgehogs and dogs can coexist.
I think everyone forgets that most marvel films are meant to be family movies.
What game is coming out in a few months? Mario maker 2?
Did you gain weight?
Will I be featured on #JackAsk ?
WHATS UNDER YOUR FOREHEAD
I found an ad that is trying to look like u
How long ago were you adopted...             sorry your parents only told me
Snow dogs was good
Aye
2:58 when he starts talking about religion the dog looks up at him hahah
OH MY GOD STOP HOLDING THE MIC SO CLOSE TO YOUR MOUTH! I HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU STARTED DOING THIS IT SOUNDS WORSE AND IS EXTREMELY ANNOYING!
üòÇ
Hey guys next YIAY let‚Äôs not answer.(don‚Äôt tell johnüò´)
‚Äúhow many shrimps do you have to eat before you make your skin turn pink? eat too much and you‚Äôll get sick, shrimps are pretty rich‚Äù 
U uneducated swine, that comment was a reference to a song about a particularly flamboyant and rose-colored bird
This video should just be called ‚ÄòManspreading 101‚Äô
MTK (MT672)
yea exposing documentaries have always been a thing to an extent with different mediums, like with the crap with child labor and carnegie and stuff way back when, so ya it‚Äôs my kink too jack
Hey, the movie Dinosaur was awesome :/
Does Klondike smell like lotion?
Operation dumbo deop is an actualy good movie, dont knock it till you try it
hola amigo
WORTH IT
Hey, dinosaure was a great movie
Is believing in yourself for spacepowers not the point of Scientology?
I love that the try guys used it
#jackask Mmm?
The worst part of this video is when he showed the pit bull song he actually liked it...
The thing that‚Äôs hard is watching these knowing it won‚Äôt be as good as before.
I like this video
You JackAsk, you ignored my question.
Jack, are you okay? I know you probably won't see this, but lately it seems like the enthusiasm behind your videos is gone, and you seem less than happy. Are you alright? We would all understand if you needed to take a break, or post less often or something. I can't speak for the rest of your viewers, but my sister and I are worried about you.
Every wednesday....
üñï
Mediocre episode at best
Actual question, do you wish or plan to make future video projects that‚Äôs its own unique thing and isn‚Äôt a YIAY, YGS, Jackask, etc?
2:59 Dog wants to know your religion
Dinosaur was great you giant foreheaded mutant man
No
nerd
ksakcaj
Woah, woah, woah, did you just lump Dinosaur and John Carter in with Planes and Mars Needs Moms? 
And I thought we were friends, Jack smh

ALSO , serious recommendation here: look up Ancient Aliens Debunked. It's a free, three hour documentary on YouTube (Search ‚ÄòAncient Aliens Debunked - Full Movie‚Äô) that's very well made and it's hilarious watching the Ancient Aliens T.V. show get torn apart. Watch it right now.
So many youtubers could learn from you on how to make your sponsorship bits not awful.
3:00 the dog gives him a look because of his religion
Lol
2:56 omg the dog looks at him when he asks: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your religion?‚Äù
Me me big boi
Y did I do it?!
Why did I drink to much wait. Can u even drink to much
Your shirt comments lead me to your croch
gayyyyyy
I‚Äôm turning 21 in July and I can‚Äôt wait to get pleasantly buzzed
When will you stop spreading your legs? üóø
So that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt have space powers yet
#jackask what‚Äôs going to happen in JACKASK 100
Don't you EVER insult G-Force again, I will come to your lovely looking home and trap you In a human size hamster ball and slowly fill it with water. But you can get rid of the water by running... But you WILL tire.
Is jack ask 100 gonna be 1 hour
Believing in your self until you space powers unlock. Is that related to scientology?
Why is "snow dogs" so funny when jack says it
6:10 We know you like Taylor Swift, Jack..
2:09 realtible
Um, excuse me... Dinosaur is a GREAT movie.
No
Would you like PewDiePie to host YIAY and shrek and you to host LWIAY?
He seems... Off.
How many feet is your forehead?
0:16  Now the joke here is that he contradicted himself. Can I have Groscar now?
Why did sundae look up right when you revealed your religion?
Who?
1:18 Hey! Back off Jack! Dinosaure was a good movie
Jack I‚Äôm sorry but you look ridiculous holding the Rode mic...
At 0:41 that is boyinaband

Ew YouTube light mode
What about Michael Moore‚Äôs documentaries haha?
Jack, I would take you to the movies, but they don‚Äôt allow snacks.
Believing in yourself until your space powers unlock? so Scientology?
if men are allowed to hate captain marvel can women get a pass to hate films only men like ... like the social network
As of Dinosaur wasn‚Äôt a good movie...
Believing in yourself until the space powers unlock... so scientology?
Why do we try anymore, Jack? Why?
I don't wanna talk down infinity war but James Cameron could've made it in 2005. The only difference is that people will never forget Marvel's Infinity War, and people have already forgotten the names of the characters in the highest grossing movie of all time: Avatar
Why do I hear voices saying that I‚Äôm worthless Waste of space. :(
Are you wearing fashionably ripped leggings under ripped jeans or are those jeggings?
Believing in yourself til the space powers unlock? So Scientology?
you didn't pick me you meanie
#jackask What's your real religion
Jack, why do you have erin when youre gay?
Erin:wants a pet hedgehog
Pewds and marzia:*heavy breathing*
1:19 Why did you put up the french cover of Dinosaur?
Sorry to hear about the divorce.
Why does it look like Jack is wearing leggings with a jean print on them?
I‚Äôm new to this channel and I wanted to king it‚Äôs supposed to sound like jack a** to be funny or am I just weird
Me Me Big Mic.

But seriously, get a clip on or something, this giant mic in your face while reading off your phone the whole time makes your presentation look really freakin' awkward and doesn't allow you to emote as freely or naturally as you used to.
Shrek is ready to land on the sexy tilted towers are you ready for the landing ?
Is it just me or did jack‚Äôs torso get smaller
all of the disney+ movies he named were bad except g-force was a legendary good movie
Stfu dinosaur was a great movie lmao
javck i funy fhnfbeca use he is gyes bplees
#JackAsk how did I get here?
I like your fiddle leaf fig jack
As a kid that was obsessed with dinosaurs you back tf away from Disney's Dinosaur right good damn now, that film was great
J.K "Roling" is the correct pronounciation. * flies away*
3:00... not even gonna say, just look for it.
Why does his ripped jean look like a burger?
Those Disney movies really hit hard ngl
2:59 sundae knows what‚Äôs up
4:01 that's a weird way of saying spiderman
How do babies get made?
spider man pushed the building up by believing in himself
#jackask What is your favourite video that you have made in your almost 13 years on YouTube?
sbeve
4:18 HA neeeeeeerddddd
‚ÄúHoney, the dogs will eat it ‚Äú

please close your legs and get a clip on mic
do you like pewdiepies copy of your show?
Being religious means you believe in a higher power of some sort. Does that mean God is a atheist?
johnask
So your religion is basically scientology
Hey don't hate on dinosaurs
Hey 5 year old me remembers dinosaur being very good
How do you come up with the best sponsor transition
Ugh that mic is back ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Rank the marvel movies
subtitles thought you said "welcome back to jackass"
How many times will audible try to close me. Never works
Jack. I dont care about audible
I spy with my little eye... someone‚Äôs moose knuckle
p l e a s e make the pit bull song
Do you suffer from lack of ideas sometimes?
I remember a Disney employee, sorry "cast member" asking me about a pin I had from Disney's the Wild. I told them, and they said they never heard of it. AREN'T DISNEY CAST MEMBERS SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE ENTIRE FILMOGRAPHY OF DISNEY???????
I didn‚Äôt expect an actually good acronym
Is someone going to make a compilation video of all the audible acrostics or what?
Ok not to say Captain Marvel was a masterpiece but doesn‚Äôt every Marvel movie have a ‚Äúbelieve in yourself‚Äù message? Thor 1, Thor had to prove he was worthy yadda yadda, Thor Ragnarok he unlocked his super lightning bolts bc of the little convo with his dad and he ‚Äúbelieves in himself‚Äù. Age of Ultron is essentially ‚Äúthe power of friendship‚Äù like, Captain Marvel wasn‚Äôt amazing but her unlocking her powers bc she believed in herself isn‚Äôt that far fetched
So, my mom is an atheist but my dad is a devoted Catholic. Got any advice for me to break the ice between them. Cause they been arguing over religion for a while.
#jackask When you have kids, how will you force them into Kidzbop?
why is your mic so crisp for gross
antantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantantant
Dear Jack

I really don't know what has happened lately... You used to be so entertaining with the great variety of your content... But something has to be going wrong in your life. It seems like you're not having fun anymore as you force yourself to keep doing what you are doing... 
Your sense of humor used to be so authentic and hilarious... now it has all turned into bad acting! What's going on, Jack? I am very sorry about whatever you are going through!
Please take some time off if necessary and bring back the energy and the fire as soon as it feels right for you again! Much love
Can i listen on my Nintendo?
Hey Jack get rid of that mic, I don't want to hear you inside my head nor do I wanna hear every little drop of saliva in your mouth
2:59 Klondike TRIGGERED
I feel like you're the type of person to spray paint your new hedgehog blue for the upcoming Sonic movie.
when 1/4 of the video is an ad
On the next #jackask: Will Jack ever stop manspreading?
This made me straight up chortle
G-Force is best movie ever it‚Äôs factz
Hey, all those Disney pictures are solid films!
Jack, where did the audio go??
Hey I kinda liked John Carter.
i feel like avatar 2 would probably kill it overseas
So basically Jack is a Scientologist
Please make pew diepie diss song
is it just me or does jack look dummy thicc at this angle in this sitting position?
Ay Jack don't talk shit about Dinosaur please. Please.
Believing in yourself till the spacepowers unlock sounds a tad too close to Scientology.
Where is YIAY?
Where is YIAY?
Jack Are You  GAYYYYY???      C   : sorry.
Y U COPY PEWDIEPIE?! YIAY!? LWIAY IS BETTER
They dont eat hedge hogs they eat children
me: think i'm getting 7 mins of content
jacksfilms: THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY AUDIBLE
People posting about the manspreading... It's not that bad, really.
But the real question is... is Jack getting that dad bod?
Honestly that's probably how they're gonna win
Hey John, you're killing it. Keep it up.
i hate u for ripping on captain marvel like that
When will we get featured...
Oh I KNOW
NEVER
He liked the pit bull song. Get your pitchforks out bois, time to purge.
im here for you saying "im here for it"
6:08 This legitimately terrified me.
4:27 was??
You loved outer space because that‚Äôs where your forehead was but now it in outside of outer space
Dad?
Jack doesn‚Äôt need kids to be a dad
Woah jack are them ripped Jean's, when did you become a thot?
So where's the link for the gofundme for the Pitbull parody
Haha you have a big forehead
#jackasks will to mention this and sub to me
Again copying pewdiepie and now erin is copying marzia !
Jack, your mic is great and your crotch is great. Keep it up!
Erin trying to copy Marzia
Yo is no one talking about the way the Klondike sits under that table
Who‚Äôs excited for borderlands 3!!!
You got featured on the try guys

wowie
Was it just me or when jack said goofy answers it was really cute sounding?
YES Get her a hedgehog !!! I have one and I 10/10 recommend !!!
CAMELT... Oh. Y'all noticed.
imagine being excited that your tweet made it into the video only for it to be used as a transition into an ad
Will you make a big montage when you hit 5 million subscribers?
Hey Jack, you should check out the Netflix series Dirty Money.
Think you might like it, okay, have a nice day
Ever since you‚Äôve halted your frequency of posting to push out more quality content, I have been enjoying and clicking ‚Äúlike‚Äù on everything that‚Äôs been showing up. Love this method, Jack.
5:40 your welcome.
lmao big chungus amiright
Ayy! What a surprise, my question didn‚Äôt get in.
3:00 Klondike is just like what about klondikism
ripped jeans? i like the new style
I can‚Äôt tell if his legs are real or not ?
FOR YOUUUUUUUUUU
You should have put your dogs listening to Audible in the sponsor section. Klondike would be listening to a good book, and Sundae would be listening to crappy book.
That‚Äôs funny
uwu
John Carter was good!
Damn jack has been workin' out ü§ôü§ô
This audible plug is so clutch Supermarket just dropped
Jack is serving some thighs for dinner
That rip on your knee highly offends me
Fyre doc. Really good
3:00 the dog be like
"Dude, thats the fourth time you are making that joke! How much more boring can you be?"
How do you like your tea?
Ummm where is Erin, it‚Äôs a jackask ending in a 2.
I liked Planes
I loved Dinosaur, you sonofabitch!
dont put snowdogs next to that trash
All those Disney + movies I‚Äôve seen :|
do you belive in yourself?   #jackask
Die
Ok please take out the "k's" JackAsk
See? ??
#JACKASK why are you misleading millions of fans by calling it "parodies, music and sketches," when, in reality, it's satire? This is wrong, misleading, and satirizes the fact that most people don't understand satire.
To the lady about her boyfriend. Have you considered one of you might be autistic? It's a lot easier for people like that to text then talk irl. Or you just need to put the phones away and lock yourselves in a room.... or on a island.
He‚Äôs making fun of the plot because it‚Äôs about ‚Äúbelieving in yourself‚Äù it‚Äôs not but even if it was that‚Äôs what a lot of movies are about? It‚Äôs clear he doesn‚Äôt take her or her movie seriously. Jack has been good about social issues before so I‚Äôm not trying to accuse him of being a sexist person. I just think that this is something worth calling him out on.
Nobody: 

Jacksofilms: uses dogs as filler

Also nobody:
So now that you are done bulking. How about some p90x?
Can we get a Top 10 Audible definitions?
wait a minute I LOVE SNOW DOGS
Finally a remotely funny sponsorship intro.
Oi, Dinosaure was focking amazing... Don't even joke like that.
The thumbnail looks like a Dawko thumbnail
I guess he remembers nothing of Captain Marvel. Because that‚Äôs 100% not how anything happened.
‚Äúit‚Äôs my k I N K‚Äù
He's wearing the same jeans with the hole on the knee in every Jackask.
wow 7 is lot
Thank you Jack, very cool!
the rip in your jeans looks photoshopped
If Pitbull was a superhero, what would his power/s be? #jackask
"My religion is believing in myself until the space powers unlock." Soooo... scientology?
Dinosaur is a great movie
How much is gay you have?
Oi dickcunt dinosaure is a masterpiece of modern cinema
Second time you've used "Let's Eat" in an Audible acronym, Jack. Piss poor effort, 6/10.
Whenever Jack says Jack ask I think he is saying jack ass
jack your bulge very nice today
G-FORCE IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE!!!
Jackask 92? That makes 92 in a row I haven't gotten into.
don‚Äôt EVER disrespect g force like that again
Pin me harder daddy
No joke, we‚Äôre talking about Bad Blood in my graduate seminar class. It‚Äôs a class-assigned reading but most people have already read it because it‚Äôs so good.
G-FORCE IS BETTER MOVEE
jack, as someone with 2 pet hedgehogs, i promise they're not bad! they act a bit like hamsters (liking wheels as well, their natural territory is about 5 miles- which they actually run the perimeter of every night), so they're great pets if you know what you're doing and DO THE RESEARCH. they also live for 3-5 years, so be prepared to care for them well in that time!

non serious answer: she'll get spiked once and never want to hold it again, so be glad they're 200-500 dollars depending on the breeder and you can get your money back easy
#JackAsk 
                   If you had methemoglobiemia, or the symptom that is known for making your skin blue, and someone laughed at your skin color for being blue, is it technically racist?
anyone else notice John's left nipple? I saw it at the beginning of the video and cant stop staring
Jack, why are you sitting like that???
Guys I don't think those pants were ripped on purpose
Jack do you know that there‚Äôs more colors in the world than blue, white, and green?
Hey Jack why dont you get a new opening joke fuckwad?
Jack, why dont you have any other clothes?
ew
Ant?
Oh my god i Actually remember planes and Mars needs mom's too
This video‚Äôs acronyms in my opinion, were the best!
2:30 he missed the perfect opportunity to just say ANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTSANTS
5:00 Totally agree. "The Inventor" (Netflix's documentary on Elizabeth Holmes) gave me chills.
John gotta mad cameltoe me me biiiig boi
G force is an underrated movie with an amazing soundtrack
4;18 LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A NERD ALERT!!!!!
Better then the ant-man meme thanks jack
You got something against G Force. That movie was bomb
are 2 or more cute dogs included in the audible subscription?
How dare you imply Dinosaurs isn't a cinematic masterpiece
looking chunky john
lol I have a hedgehog
this is turning into an asmr channel
Too real :(
What is your favorite fortnite skin
4:20 where‚Äôs our sassy answer jack?
I bet all the dislikes on the video are of those people whose questions didn't get featured.
oh im sorry how did thor unlock his powers?
Dinosaur is a good movie, shut up.

Captain Marvel is flat af
JackAsk? More like JackAss.
Yo 
Pump your breaks jOHHn! Dinosaur was a great film.
If Canada was real, would you do a tour of some sort doing live jack ask shows or something along those lines? #jackask
i like how whenever there isn't a question on screen you can see jack's cameltoe nuts
"...Nah" ahhahahha Very fine
2:58 I'm converting
How about do one YIAY where you answer the questions seriously
Snow Dogs is a goddamn treasure
Did anyone else get the handsome squidward ad
What'a your religion?  Doggo stares at Jack
Do it! We need to hear pitbull sing about the avengers
Dinosaurs and john carter are good
1:21 um excuse me Snow Dogs was a great movie...... unsubscribed
Snow Dogs is an amazing movie.
JOHN DOGS CANT EAT HEDGEHOGS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SPIKEY (my German shepherd is scared of my hedgehog) they are super easy to take care of, let Erin get her hedgehog.
My birthdayis april 26 and sence i was 5 wehave never celebrated my birthday, but we celebrate my brothers birthdays every year. :( why does my family hate me?
2:51 But Jack.....the hedgehog would be to faaasssstt!
anyone else gonna talk about boyinaband that was before grandayyyy
Jack, I will continually ask the same question until you answer it.
Ur gettin kinda predictable. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like shrek jokes‚Äù
laughs at shrek joke
‚ÄúWe have fun here‚Äù


Saw em all coming. Spice up ur humor, john
Captain Marvel was very good and her full space powers were unlocked when she ripped off the device on the back of her head that was dampening her powers.
My kink is Jack ragging on Captain Marvel for five minutes straight
5:43 is it just me, or did Sundae give the camera an adorable freaking cheeky smile for a split second?
Jack ask 100!
Okay but john carter was good
to be fair g-force and mars needs moms are FANTASTIC movies
5:41 throwing in his dog to get more people to use the discount
Someone ask him on twitter what game he is talking about that comes out in 3 months? On the next #jackask
idk why everyone‚Äôs complaining abt the mic, i hardly notice it
I mean, I understand why guys manspread but really? In THOSE pants?
What about a pet child?
Why do you have so many sponsors plz shout me out if you don't pick me your gay #jackask
Only important part of captain marvel. CAT VOMIT JEWL.
God look at that manspread.
Weed Smokers! Peep Out The DANK Content! :D
JACK, ARE YOU GETTING CHUBBY AGAIN ?
It actually bothered me that that‚Äôs how you interpreted that movie and then kept repeating that false interpretation so good job
Jk R√¶woling
Haha fuhny avengurs mem
HOW MANY FOOT IS YOU'RE FOURHED
The Avengers won‚Äôt believe in themselves.


They will believe at themselves.
i thought it was a hulu ad
I hate that he was funny enough to make me watch all the way through his audible promotion
Hedgehogs are illegal in California. Sorry Jack.
1:15 he just listed all of the movies I used to watch when I was 2, and brain dead... (Especially g-force bc apparently 2 year old me loved out to the black eyed pees, according to my mom...) -1000000 respecc to my mom for letting me watch that shite
frick you dinosaure was a wonderful movie
I had a pet hedgehog it died of cancer sadly, so I'd suggest to not get one. They're cute, but a pain to deal with. They are like rats in how good they are at growing tumors. Not to mention you have to go to an "exotic" vet clinic that costs twice as much. Mine and a lot of others have to get one eye removed because of them scratching themselves which leads to infection. But y'all probably have more money than a 14-year-old so you can get checkups more frequently, causing fewer problems. They are nocturnal so you will always hear them in the night no matter what room you put them in, my sister always complained about it even though she slept on the opposite side of the hall. The smell of the cage is very bad just like a cat litter box. They are not social animals they like living in complete solitude. They will need a bath every two weeks and a checkup every year. They are adorable for the first few months. The life span is from 3 to 7 years. Hopefully, you read this comment in the vast ocean of other comments. Good luck.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 R.I.P Jefferson 2015-2019

Excuse u! G-force is one of the greatest movies of all time :(
I honestly forgot about g-force. that was something tucked away in the dark corners of my brain.
Why are Jack‚Äôs acronyms actually getting good?

You reminded me to cancel my audible subscription, for now, thanks. After I get my free book credit though.
Jack looks so done with making video honestly
4:32 they did.  They revealed that iron man and nebula got to earth
I like to go blind to movies as well do avoid trailers like the plague!
The shirt looks like a weird way to get people to look at your crotch, where can I purchase one mr.films?
Ask to borrow Ian's pitpull costume! Duh! Or just ask him to be pitbull! Or ask pitbull
2:15 That's...pretty accurate.

You didn't answer my question john.
I didn't think this video was going to make me laugh. It did. Thank you Jac <3
I'm gonna start saying "my new kink is ___"
Yo this ‚Äúaudible‚Äù thing sounds lit. Might check it out ;)
dude cmon I loved the wild and snow dogs ;-;
Nice audible thing!
LMAO I HAVE TWO HEDGEHOGS AND THEY LAZY AF! THEY ALWAYS TRY TO HOG UP EVERYTHING
0:39 omg is that the real boyinaband ?
i'm sorry but G Force is a world-renowned classic, John
Please hold your mic further away from your mouth, it sounds really weird hearing every move that your mouth makes.
Hey snow dogs was a classic. I remember when my family and I would go on family road-trips and didn't have internet so I would watch DVD's from the dollar bin from walmart when we stopped for stuff. When going to wyoming I had to watch nothing else but, snowdogs for hours on end.
JK. Rowling ruined the story years after she made it to get revenge for everyone saying her name wrong. She has stated multiple times that is pronounced rolling.
i love how one of the dogs look at jack as soon as he talks about religion
Nonono u got this all wrong the avengers will beat thanks because of that cat from Captain marvel. It‚Äôs just gonna eat thanos and the movies gonna be like 5 minutes long
I started to write an angry correction on your Captain Marvel joke, but then I remembered this is JackAsk and you probably meant for that to be funny and not taken seriously.
in all seriousness, you‚Äôre the only youtuber that makes me laugh
How dare you insult Dinosaur and Snow Dogs!
Boyinaband: makes a comment
Jack: yeah whatever
Dr. Grandayy: makes a comment
Jack: oh woah haha grandayy
Boyinaband: Am i a joke to you
Why did you steal your own intro from another Jackask for this video?
You should start referring to Erin as wamin
Jack my school had Shrek the musical and I was one of the actors and all my friends laughed at me when I was in duloc :(

I've been watching since you didn't even make YIAY and only today did I found out Jackasks comes from Jack Asks because of how you said it in the audible promo
That guy didn‚Äôt know he had klonddike and that other one  smh
I‚Äôd rather read a book then listen to a book
3:40 just where a nice wig and a tight red red dress and you are good to go
pls die
Believing in herself....... Like that's literally all the shonen animes are about? The boy gets powerful by believing in himself but it's a girl and suddenly it's a joke. 
Okay lmao, I see.
The guy who said "Binks, Jar-Jar Binks" like he's James Bond is my idol.
I feel like not even James Cameron could get it right.
Aang, Toph, Katara, Sokka, Zuko, Azula, Iroh, Ozai, the Boulder, Jet, and Bumi.

Dude in wheelchair who later becomes blue man
Sigourney Weaver

Where's my money?
I do remember Jake Sully, but only because the alien lady said something along the lines of "You know nothing, Jake *Soolee*", and that really stuck with me.
"can you name any character from avatar?"

J E S U S     C H R I S T
After hard thinking, I remembered "Navi", but it turns out that wasn't a character, but the smurfs as a whole, lol

No one remembers because their names are like ‚ÄúNeytiri‚Äù or ‚ÄúTsu‚Äôtey‚Äù

Jake sully is the only one I remember cause that blue girl screaming ‚ÄúJAKKYEEEEE‚Äù. Shit made me laugh

I was actually obsessed with avatar for a while, bought the art book and everything. But I can only remember a few names.
Jake Sully
Neytiri 
Mo‚Äôat
Tsu-t√©
Man each person really saying "DARK Vader "
Jesus christ is my favourite avatar character
2:30 
That woman only named green characters. But once she was asked the Avatar question she got shocked for not knowing blue characters LMAO!
‚ÄúJake suuuuuuullllllyy!‚Äù That‚Äôs the only name, just cause how they say it.
Kinda sucks you don't link or even name Erik or Brock's channels in the description.
I immediately said Jake Sully.
Not because of the movie though, but because of Elyse in FunHaus.
Can you name one character from Avatar 
Random lady: ‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Äù
Jack: cut
Me: Correct
Well... there was Blue furry Pocahontas.


And...


Uh...


That's all I remember from it.
Thanks for posting this jack, the Question Boys have gotten me through some hard times
i hate so much that i know like literally almost all the character names because my family loves avatar for some reason like we have the extra extended edition we've watched it a dozen times we're just LIKE THIS
No Memes about it?

You Know What to do Bois
Honestly this is probably my favorite video of yours ever. Not just because it‚Äôs hilarious but because you look like you‚Äôve had so much fun making it, and it comes across.
Jack: Name one character from the movie avatar
Me: Suit 2
(Look at the cast list)
4:11 WRONG
"Dark Vader"
Jesus Christ
nobody:
me: memorizes every character from avatar just incase some random guy in the beach asks me to name a character from a crappy movie for 5 dollars.
"Avatar is the top grossing film of all time"
Avengers endgame:

Jake "The Paraplegic" Sully
I suppose Christ is always with us. $5 to the lady at 6:31 pls.
‚ÄúCan you name an avatar?‚Äù 

‚ÄúJesus Christ.‚Äù
It was actually James Cameron's mom spending $500,000 on tickets
This feels a bit like the "old" Jacksfilms, but it's still new and I really enjoyed it.


Wait, did I just give constructive criticism?


Ur forehead big
"Can you name someone from Avatar"

Jack‚Äôs hateboner for Avatar is the best thing.

i need more question boys in my life, please. thank you.
Jake Sully, never seen the movie but I watch Funhaus, people who knows, knows.
I remember some of the characters from Avatar. Were they called Papa and Mama Smurfs?
Ask them again after avatar gets 10 movies 2 series+
Jacksfilms: Can you name a character from "Avatar"?
Me: Avatar
WIJWIW I LOVED THIS.. We need more question boys.. And the way their interactions with the people was soo adorable.. Jack's reaction to the fanboy.. And his laugh at the end..and the "oh I fuked it up" iwhwwihwjwhwh
Today I learned that the main character from Avatar is named Jake Sully.
Easy 
Papa smurf
Smurfette 
Wheel chair boi
And generic army bad dude
Uhh, Gamora... Does that count?
One of the characters is Blue Gamora.

GAMORA WAS IN AVATAR WHAT THE HECK
Roses are red,

I miss my fellow Q Boyz already.
I think I recognize one of these actors from the trailer for Jack's CYOA
The ones I remember are Jake (couldn't remember the last name), Neytiri and the tree Eywa
Jake Sully. God I need to get out more
lmao he's just holding a condenser mic
John Patrick Douglass continues his crusade to destroy the Avatar, 2019 (Colorized)

Thanks to Funhaus, I remember Avatar's very own Jake Sully!
Jesus Christ is the best character in avatar  

Change my mind
hi yes ang the only important persoan in the mvivie and show
If the question was could you name a character from Avatar: The Last Airbender a lot more people would be able to answer lol
I‚Äôve been thinking real hard throughout this video and all I can remember is ‚ÄúJake.‚Äù Yes, just his first name.
nope. i couldn't to save my life.
The question boys >> the try guys
I'll name 3 right now
1. Marine 1
2. General
3. Furry Bait
I remembered Jake. I didn't remember his last name, but I know his name was Jake.
I can‚Äôt not remember JaKe SoOlLy
The main dude was called like Jake I think and the blue chick was neytiri? 
Or maybe that's from Warcraft or League or something.
Edit: holy shit it actually was. He had like a "native" name too right? 
I rewatch it maybe once every 3-4 years whenever I think of the pretty pretty bio-luminescent plants and the HttyD bird pterodactyl part.
Who in the hell refers to Jar Jar Binks by his last name, like he's a politician lol
i remember the main character's name because that Funhaus video
6:30
Name one character from Avatar
Woman: Jesus Christ
tbh i would've gotten this cause i remembered the name of the big flying thing was Toruk
Nobody:


Lady: "Jesus Christ"
jacksfilms goes outside
YouTube trending: ooh I like this
I can name two.





Aang and Korra.
Jesus Christ is my favorite Avatar character
Bro I loved avatar as a kid I was hyper fixated on it. I named all my accounts after Neytiri
Name one character from avatar..
Name one character from Avatar.


J E S U S  C H R I S T
I like how YouTube glitches out on me again so that the title now says WE ACT OUT SMOSH FAN FICTION
i paused this, googled the cast for avatar, and chose a super easy name i can remember. I am now prepared.
Look at that last guy's shirt. He's clearly a Na'vi in disguise.
*WATCHES AVATAR AGGRESSIVELY* 

please give me money
the guy who said "the airbender one?" is my hero
Jacksfilms: Can you name a character from "Avatar"?
Me: Pocahontas
When i saw the title i immediately thought 'Nemo'
I remember Netyri..
Jack: says the f word
Video: censors
A question boi: says the f word
Video: K
So satisfying!!
Immediately got Jake Sully. 
In the movie, the Na'vi call him something like Jacka Sully, but in a way that distinctly sounds like Shaka Zulu. Remembered that, and got the name back.
im mad cuz i knew the main characters name in avatar i would of got the 5 bucks.. its jake btw
I literally watched Avatar three times and I can't remember a single character name.
That guy who said Jar Jar Binks is my hero
Jake? Or jack?
Edit: hii i almost saw avatar full movie.
avatar is alien pocohantas. change my mind
Nobody: 
Lady: J E S U S C H R I S T
I only remember Jake Sulley or specifically Jake Sooleeeee from Funhaus
Can you name one of the characters in avatar? the blue people.

I was convinced Tobias F√ºnke was in Avatar somewhere
‚ÄòName a character from Avatar‚Äô
‚ÄòJesus Christ‚Äô
hell yeah!  do more stuff with Comment Etiquette.  
he makes some of the greatest videos of all time.
I've seen Avatar more than any other movie, and the only name I can remember is "Jake". Lmao.
EDIT: After further thought, I remembered that his last name was Sully. Still can't name a SINGLE other character though.
Ah yes, Jesus Christ . My favorite character in Avatar.
the last airbender
Jake sulley. I know that just from funhaus
This was the best video you've made in a while mate. Good job!
What if someone just watched Avatar before that
This is the type of Jacksflims I love. Great vid üëç
Imagine when you guys asked them to name a single avenger and they said batman and when you asked them to name a star wars character they said spock then you ask them name to an avatar character they name all the main characters
What‚Äôs 1 character from avatar? JesusChristüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Now jacksfilms has to make a video titled "No." so that one guy will be correct.
The guy who just said Jake got screwed, he shoulda won it. No one knew Yoda's last name.
Answers Yoda 
next question answers: "I don't know their names, they're like aliens".
If someone said ‚ÄúJake Sooly‚Äù would you take it?
Was ‚ÄúNeytiri‚Äù a name?
the blue one
GAMORA
Question: name any single character on avatar 
Violet jacket girl: Jesus Christ
I actually know 2 of the characters but only because of Funhause thanks Elyse.
here from mrsunday
The all i remember about this movie is pandora, mech suit, and hypotermia people
in case you're wondering, their names were 'Jake' and 'Neytiri'

pretty lame, I know.
guys remember the part where the girl said jesus christ


just want to say that again cuz not enough people in the comments mentioned it tbh, still funny after 100 comments amirite
I‚Äôve seen it multiple times and can‚Äôt name anyone
JESUS CHRIST I'M DYING
Tony Stark. (Iron Man)
Luke Skywalker.
Jake Sully.
Ez
Thanks to Funhaus, the only character I know is Jake Sully. I tried watching it on a plane ride but got super bored of it and fell asleep form how boring it was.
6:29
One character, from Avatar?

JeSuS ChRIsT
I love how Jack can blend the sponsor in with the video so well.
jesus christ is in avatar?
if no one can name a single character from Avatar then can we be really sure Jesus Christ wasn't one of them? i say let's give the purple hoodie lady the benefit of the doubt
This video made me realize how little I know and remember of the highest grossing film in history üëç
I don‚Äôt remember a thing from the movie Avatar and I saw it twice
oh i know papa smurf
This frustrates me haha because I was a huge fan and I would've won  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I can only off the top of my head remember 2 characters names but that would've been enough üò≠
Bruh the bible is my favorite character nvm jesus
This is actually the smartest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Sadly I can name at least three characters cause apparently my dad and I are the only people that loved that movie üòû. I think he made me love it.
I only remember one name which is Navi, and only cause it means bellybutton in my language
JAKE SULLLEH!!
Now I'll be ready when someone comes up to me offering $5 if I can name a character from Avatar! Thanks jacksfilms!
Erik: name one character from Avatar

Random Woman: jEsuS cHrisT
Haha the skip button at the start got me
Main protagonist in Avatar is Jake I think
6:29 is what you‚Äôre here for... you‚Äôre welcome
2:30
me when anyone asks me anything about Avatar
I really am hoping for some more Question Bois videos
I only know Jake Sully because of Funhaus
Well they are military boyz so I would of just said SGT. Jackson and probably have won.

Edit: Nvm They need a full name. gg lads
"Anyone like money? More specifically five of them" üòÇüòÇ
I love the absolute certainty with which that one woman answered "Jesus Christ". It legit made me ask myself "wait, what happens in Avatar again? Is Jesus in that one?"
I spent this whole video just internally shouting JAKE SULLY
JAKE SULLY
I think the dude who said Jake should have own
YOO i remember one of the blue people!!
Tsu'tey?? I dunno who it was, i think it might've been a guy? And the one reason i know is because he was part of the pairing for a Avatar/Harry Potter crossover fanfiction 


I have paypal feel free to send me my 5 whenever-
IS THAT THE BLUE PEOPLE
My favorite avatar character is basketball avatar #2
I just want Erik to do more stuff like this or whatever else aside from the regular comment etiquette lessons. He is just hilarious in any friggin thing he does.
Jake Sully is literally all I remember lmao. I feel like the female Navi protagonist had a name starting with an a?


Edit: Not even close.
Please make Question Boys into an actual series pls
Yeah I can name some
Fergus, Farkle, and Felicia.
"Jesus christ" she should of won a hundred dollars
Does Papa Dragon count?
Jack's film




Zuh
Somewhere in space, Jake Sully is sad.

Edit: na I finished the video and Jake is probably happy, but I bet Miles Quatrich is furious...
"Can you name one Jacksfilms video"
Dude: yeah yeah I got this
grabs mic
"No."
jake scully, more like jacksfilms scully







booooooooo
7:05 Jack genuinely surprised and happy
Jake Sully from the Jarhead clan is literally the only character I can name.
His name is Robert Paulson- ehg, i mean Jake Sully
Oh man, I love Avatar! I can name all the characters!


Generic McSoldierboy
Ladypilot
Sergeant Gruff Angryman
Space Jeff Bezos
Blue Pocahontas
Blue Pocahontas' Jealous Ex-Boyfriend
Sigourney Weaver
Science Boy


That's the major characters, anyway.  I hope this helps!
As i clicked the thumbnail i thought jake sully. to be fair though its the ONLY one i know cause the blue peeps kept saying it
bro I literally only remember that chick named Grace and that the blue people were called the Navi'
Iron what? Sounds like a dead man
this video is so infuriating bc i actually can name one and i really need $5
IMDb synopsis for Avatar 2009:
"There is a large yellow machine and there is an old man driving it. And some blue people"
OH MY GOD HALF WAY THROUGH THE VIDEO I REMEMBERED THE NAME OF A CHARACTER



Ranger Rick
Jake Sully and Nateri are the only ones I know
I was second guessing myself the whole video if Jake Sully was the character. Glad I knew that.
It's probably just cause the trailer looked good for it's time
0:30 You see, Avatar is the top grossing film of all time


Shrek fans:
Geezusss, use an ND filter John, you sadist.
Hey where the asking lads
Jake Sully
Nateyrie?
Trudy
Norman
yea i legit cant think of any names either rip
6:29
‚ÄúName one character from the movie Avatar.‚Äù
‚ÄúJesus Christ.‚Äù
I‚ÄôM WHEEZING
This is so funny to me. It‚Äôs probably because of people like me because it‚Äôs so high grossing. When it first came out I was much younger and it was my favourite movie of all time. I would watch it nearly every day. I haven‚Äôt watched it for years but I still know all the characters names üòÇüòÇ
I only saw it once, and I only remember the name Jake Sully because I was annoyed how blue chick kept calling him "Sooly"
this was honestly a really enjoyable video and it was good content. good job jack and question boys
3:56 - Hey isn't that the Leigh guy, who made Saw and Dead Silence etc?
Water. Earth. Fire. Air.

Long ago, the four Nations lived in harmony until the 2009 film Avatar came out.

Only Jesus Christ, master of all James Cameron movies, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished.
Ummmm they all neglected to remember my fave character from avatar, grace, played by sigourney weaver...üòÇ
5:56 Stop spoiling endgame bro!!
Wow, that dude said Jar Jar Binks way to quickly.
4:13 ‚Äúuhh, dark Vader‚Äù Me: DARK VADER HMMMMMM
Can you name one person from avatar?

bLuE PeOpLe
More people know about Avatar: The Last Airbender. This makes me very happy.
I remembered Jake Sully, but honestly I wouldn't have been confident enough that it was the correct name to answer it.
I KNEW the main character's name was Jake. Forgot his last name tho.
How does NOBODY remember that woman screaming JAKE SULLY!!!!
Mr beast: Gets sponsored by honey
Mr beast: Gives $100,000 to small streamers

JacksFilms: Gives 5 dollars away for a naming a character in Avatar
This whole video is over exposed üòÇüòÇ



Love it
Nope I can‚Äôt.
No lie XD
YEE, BOY! Those question boys sure are asking Questions! 

YOOT.
Jake Sully 
N‚Äôteri
Me: reads title
Me: "Aang."
Wait what that's not just Erik twice
Yo I love Dark Vader
Hi! We're the overexposed boiz!
Jake I think is one but I only remember because it‚Äôs said a lot
My favorite characters from Avatar are Will Smith‚Äôs Genie and the blue aliens from the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Blue‚Äù music video.
i only remember Jake Sully and Grimace from McDonalds
Jack sound like a seagull or something at the end üòÇ
All I remember was the main guy was called Jake
Uhh we got papa Smurf, smurfets, big  boi smurf, and brainy Smurf that's all the blue avatars I know
4:12 DARK vader. 
OOF
The underrated moment is this is when Jack gets excited that he meets one of his fans. It's such genuine excitement from both of them.
Jake Sully.



I haven't seen the video yet, I just want to show off.
jack: who‚Äôs one person from avatar
me: s M u r F E t T E
this will be the easiest five bucks you won‚Äôt make
Okay why is John the only one logically dressed for the hot sun? Got BO just watching. Great vid can't wait for the next üëç
Alexander Hamilton - the most popular avatar character
Next time on the question bucks:
Can I hold your baby?
8:11 that laugh tho jacküòÇ
The ending of Avatar where Jesus himself rises to harold  the apocalypse remains then most subversive third act in film history.
I remember the plot but not the characters
I watched this yesterday and forgot everyones names
I always thought that the main character was called James Cameron because the movie was called ‚ÄúJames Cameron‚Äôs Avatar‚Äù
The guy in the second round said "Dark Vader" he should have been out before he even got to the Avatar question...
4:24 - 4:38 When you're trying to rack up those half points on an exam
This reminds me of YIAY#417

"uhhhhhhh... dark vader"
The question boys üòé
Theres Papa Smurf, cripple, sexual tension doctor, dead brother, bad fake tan guy, smurfette, and




Oh and all the people who go blue mode are furries change my mind
me with my unfortunately detailed homestuck knowledge: jake and netyri üòî
Jake Sulley, Uh....Sigourney Weaver...that other guy.
5:15 wave check 






its his hair boy
I watch funhaus so I know Jason sully
Question Boy: "Can you name any jacksfilms video?"

Dude: *walks confidently to the mic* "NO"
"Dark Vader"? 4:12
Answering 'no' to a 'can you...' question is a correct answer if you 'can't...'.
7:06 is that his bellybutton?
Her are some names from avatar: Neytiri, Jake Sully, Tsu'tey, Grace, Mo'at that's all I know
Papa Smurf

Dark Avatar
Blue Mans Group
Blues Clues
I've never taught about it, but you're goddamn right, I can't
Yuh, I was the blonde kid in the red swimsuit who didn't know the last name.
2:04 Darth Vader IS Aniken Skywalker
HOW COULD YOU FORGET JAKESULLYY
Will smith
Papa smurf
Megamind
Sonic the hotdog

I named 4 avatar characters
just Jake on my mind.
This is how i have always felt about avatar
Avatar? As in the airbender? 
Love thatüòÇ
I remember Neytiri, but that's simply because my search engine won't forget....
This really is a good video. It is very noticeable that his quality and creativity has improved a lot since the burnout video
Jake Sully, how could you forget that?
Somehow I remembered the name "Neytiri" but not "Jake"
Blue gamora
it's so weird seeing erik outside of his natural habitat.
Avatar uses sub bots confirmed.
TV Q?   








Quear?
jack saying "get the hell out" made me choke my drink
needs sponsor for $10
I cant believe I only know Jake's name from watching funhaus
I can‚Äôt wait for the next question boys next year.
8:12 This looks like some sort of gradient


Erik to Eack to Jack
omg this was so easy

the blue man group obviously
It's my favorite movie. I've watched it 7,5 times already. I can list two, Jake Sully and Naytiri (no idea how to write it tho)

EDIT unless Eywa counts but I don't think we count it as a character. Oh and it's Neytiri I was close...
Ignoring spelling mistakes I can name 3 off the top of my head: Jake Sully, General Quarich, Naytari
‚ÄúName one character from Avatar.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù
Jesus Christ was my fave character in avatar
Great video John but please for the love of god can you tone down on the exposure I think I'm going blind
Please, pick up some ND filters
I firmly believe Avatar 2 will bomb.
Avatar never happened here, the only people who can name the main character are from a parallel universe where it did happen
The main guy was Jake, that's all I remember.
John. Gimme 5 bucks.
Eric was digging Clair üòè
Can you name a single character from avatar?



JESUS CHRIST


I honestly don‚Äôt understand how he was able to keep a straight face
The video makes a good point but to be fair...
1. The Navi had unusual/hard to remember names
2. It has a lot to do with advertising and commercialism, as well as the length of time these characters have been in the spotlight due to the franchise factor (some of the people in the vid hadn't even watched the Star Wars or Avengers movies but still were aware of the names)
3. Social media and the internet has become much more widespread, movies have become more engrained in pop culture and our memories via meme culture
I watching this video trying to think of one of the characters names and then it hits me, Jake
I unironically love Avatar, I wish I lived near Santa Monica.
More Question Boyz please?
Can you name 1 jacksfilms video?
No.
6:31 i
Lol so hard.
only knew Jake SoOlLy'S name cuz of Elyse from Funhaus hahahah
Now we now...




...Avatar used bots at the movies

Grass is green
Green as an alligator
His makes no sense 
Refrigerator
Natiri was Jake's Girlfriend
I literally only know one character is named Jake Sully because of the funhaus avatar game episodes!
For some reason I know all about Jake Sully and the way everyone said his name in that movie with different accents and shit but I can't remember any other character.
4:24 Come on you couldn't even remember the name of the old man driving the large, yellow machine in Avatar? Sheesh
why the question bois hold the mic like that!?
Haven‚Äôt seen avatar ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I can only name one because I played Ocarina of Time and thought "Oh, same name!"
" jake " that's all I can come up with
6:28 Name one Character from Avatar
I feel like the people where called the navi but idk dose that count
I only remember natiri (the blue lady) idk why
Main characters name is Jake, but I don't know his last name.
JAKE SULLY
I ONLY KNOW RHIS BECAUSE THEY ARE HATE BUILDING A WHOLE PARK FOR IT üôÉ
All the dislikes are from James Cameron under different account names.
This is such GREAT content!!!
Please do more question boiiz
This is amazing!
WHEN WILL HE GET A HAND HELD MICROPHONE???
one guy actually got it damn
Comparatively, few characters in Avatar had names.
ITS MY BOY ERIK
lmfao I definitely can't but I love that movie
6:28 can we meme this
There is no way they went outside


The background is a paid actor
Jake Sully. The main character.
The Try Guys used your intro!! üòÇ
Elise Willems should have been in this.
Jake Sooly speaks the true true
CAN QUESTION BOYS BE A FULL SERIES I ACTUALLY LOVED THIS
Wheelchair guy is Jake is he not
Of course:





1- MC on the wheelchair
2- Tall blue alien female lead
3- Doctor Number 5 on the military facility
4- Evil Sargent that controls a mecha
5- Blue tall guy that hates the MC and loves female lead
The names binks
Jar jar binks
I mean: Technicaly Aang wasn't wrong
4:11 "Dark Vader"
I did a whole project on Zoe Saldana and mentioned her characters name a few times but I still can't remember it.

Prolly cuz avatar is famous in other countries not just us
lonzo jersey
"This is gonna be the easiest 5 bucks you don't make" 
Best part
i think one guy's name was Jason or something right or Jacob and that was the main white guy....right?



UPDATE: I just googled it. His name was JAke SOOOOO close
I can't believe I actually remembered a character. I told myself "I don't know any names, but I bet there's really weird alien names with an apostrophe somewhere in between" and I thought of Tal'Set who is the main character of the videogame Turok: Dinosaur Hunter (which is currently available on the Nintendo eShop for $19.99) 

This led to a memory being activated in my brain that hadn't been activated in a long time. The first time I bought Turok was about a month before watching Avatar in theaters. I remembered that during the movie they refer to a dragon as "Toruk" and I had told myself back then "oh cool, that's sounds awfully close to Turok"

THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO REMEMBER A DAMN CHARACTER FROM THE MOVIE AVATAR!!!!
Thanks to you I won our school'school's trivia day
I resonate with the guy who said "Aang"
I have the advantage in likes so i wanna say..
Sub to pewdiepie 
And that everybody be gangster till the squid walks in the room
The fact that I actually remember one is bad.
Papa Dragon is the old dude that tries killing all the avatars to get the dumb metal.
#BeatAvatar #WhateverItTakes
That one girl really into the green people 
"the hulk"
"yoda"
Me: "I wanna watch this 9 minute video but I only have 8 minutes"
Jack: "today's video is sponsored by honey"
Me: " say no more"
awww eric has a crush on claire #claireric
I for some reason remember the name Toruk Makto, its not a specific character's name but it counts right? I think my mum made fun of it and it stuck with me
Let Endgame beat Avatar
AANG KATARA ZUKO TOPH , did i win
Can you name ANYONE from the movie: avatar.
Ask if anyone knows a main character from rogue one lol
4:02 spider-man isn't an avenger
I would‚Äôve mentioned the one and only toruk makto ‚ù§Ô∏è
Aang.
‚ÄúThis is gonna be the easiest 5 bucks you don‚Äôt make‚Äù had me dying
During the whole video I kept repeating "Jake Sully" like I thought someone on the screen would hear me.
[insert glib analysis and already stated cliche comment here in an attempt to be funny]
Edit: OMG I got X number of likes you guys wow thanks.
J A K E  S U L L Y
I literally own the movie but don‚Äôt remember shot about it lmao
todays fact: the first comment guy is just a bot
Funhaus engrained the name Jake Sully in my brain. They really preparing me for the real world.
... ehhmm... I can describe them all to you. I remember the story. But I do not remember a single name xD edit: i feel like the main character was named Jack. Edit2: after research, the main character is called Jake. I was close

I can name you almost all characters from avatar the last airbender though xD
The nerd inside me is sitting back laughing at all those poor souls saying ‚ÄúDark Vader‚Äù
Yo it‚Äôs my favourite film and can name one person lol
Avengers). Hawkeye
Star Wars). R2-D2
Avatar). the one guy from the blue man group
I yelped when he said ‚ÄúAang.‚Äù
im blue dabedebededa
Avatar was a technological marvel for it's new 3D tech but had no cultural relevance. That's why for a while after that the many 3D TVs were sold.
2:54 i respect that kid
4:53 and that man too
Question boy: Can you name a person from the movie ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù

Pedestrian: ARE THOSE THE BLUE PEOPLE?
Please do this more often
Avatar is probably viewed more internationally
Yes I can name a character and his name is Aang
Would Eywa be a character? 







If so... I win five bucks, also I did not look anything up.
5:34 "It's a cruel game you're playing Jacksfilm....s."




That's my new yearbook quote.
My favorite Avatar character is papa smurf
We da top ten boyz
Jake sully GOAT forever, doesn‚Äôt deserve this disrespectüò•üò¨
4:12 dark Vader?
The thing is, Anakin and Darth Vader are the same person
1:14


middle boy
I know the guy with the blue arrow on his head
Did that dude say "Dark Vadar"?
"luke skywalker"
"Anikin skywalker" 
"darth vader" 

So the same person twice and his son, great minds boys.
ha i know the name of them the navi
Omg you look like Elton john
These mofuckers never seen funhaus videos of avatar
After watching many Mr. Beast videos i was expecting Jack to offer ten thousand dollars to anyone who guessed and giving it to them anyway
"Large yellow machine and an old man driving it"

I mean... He's not wrong but...
Hilariously enough I would win this because I can actually remember the main character's name after all these years, and I don't know why it stuck with me.
If I remember correctly, it's "Jake Sully" and I only remember that because his blue gf says his name weird throughout the movie.
Can't name a single other character though.
Jake sully 
Jake sully 
Jake sully
I thought you meant avatar not avatar
ooo Jake Soolee I know Jake Soooleee.
"This is gonna be the easiest 5 bucks you don't make"
This is a personal attack.
6:29 nailed it
‚ÄòUhhhh spider man‚Äô LOVE THAT GUY
I don't remember the characters names in Titanic either, and the whole 3 and half hours is basically carried by only 2 people. I remember them, but not their names. Maybe I'm just shit with names or maybe it's a James Cameron thing. Some directors focus on characters more whereas he seems to focus on cutting edge technology and breaking new ground for cinema.
Mr. Beast: Take Free Money
Jack: No! Absolutely Not!
aaaaaaand jacksfilms is ballin
I was thinking peter sully the whole time for some reason
clearly not a great movie
I could name 2 off the top of my head. Jake Sully and Nateri, or whatever her name is.
me: sees title 

jake sooley
The first chick was hot
That was clever!
‚ÄúJesus Christ.‚Äù

(Anyone want to roast my channel feel free, I‚Äôm trying to make better content)
My favorite character from Avatar is Jub Jub
oh god I can't
Damn I got 3 character names just like that , Jake sully , Neytiri , Eywah the tree god
5:04 made the video for me
Papa Smurf
up next on Question Boys: we ask James Cameron why he wants to make 4 Avatar sequels that no one wants to see
jack, please more of this. im kinda sick of the YIAY's.
answer to last question, mo'at
ü§£ü§£ü§£
I know I know!!!!
To be fair most of the Avenger characters have their own movies which are titled after their name ("Captain America", "The Hulk", "Thor",  ...) and there are more than 20 movies in the MCU.
Same thing applies to Star Wars : there are 9 star wars movies, all of them featuring at least one member of the Skywalker family...that would be hard not to remember any name.
Alternate title:

Avatar Social Experiment(GONE SEXUAL)(GONE WRONG) (PAINFUL)
My first thought was the avatar the last air bender movie... That's just sad
I knew Jake Sully and Ney'tiri (Or however you spell it) Oh and Toruc Macto
Only jacksfilm video I've seen
I remember Jake Sully because he has the same initials as John Smith.
No one:

JK Rowling: Harry Potter takes place in the same universe as Avatar
Jake, Natieri and Grace was all I could remember
papa smurf. that was the cat lady
Jake Sooly... i only know that from funhaus
THIS is ART!
I know all the characters 
Smurf
Probably John 
Blue man group
Avatar
Aaang
Jesus Christ
That guy from guardians of the galaxy


When will I get my five moneys
JakeSully, grace,
Jake Sully is one. Right?
Easy. "Jake Sully will go first" is my go to phrase when I'm about to do something dumb but my friend walks in front of me to initiate.
I actually tried thinking hard on the blue girl‚Äôs name, and sure enough I guessed two of the letters right
Psh. No one watched Avatar for the characters. 
We all watched it for the creepy hair sex
(Which also worked on animals!)
THUS IS THE BEST THING EVER
No memes of it?  We need to change that, who wants hair intercourse?
THIS IS HELLA TRUE
NEYTIRI! JAKE? RIPLEY?
damn erik's looking a little rough
Funhaus is all about Avatar.
Didnt look it up, not sure how to spell his name, but jake soolee? pay me


Edit: Didnt finish the video before writing the comment but i guess it is just sully, i got the answer from the funhaus video
Just say John
There is always a John
"I see you, Jake Sulley" <-- This was a meme back in 2009 for like 2 weeks. That's why i know.
I just watched it a month ago for the first time and already forgot
If u can‚Äôt name Jake Sully. GTFO
Jake Sully, Thats all i know
Now I have to go learn the names of Avatar characters, in case I too, come across a wild Jack.
jacksfilms: YIAY
pewds: LWIAY
jacksfilms: QUESTION BOYZ
pewds: (currently waiting for a response)...
is one name Jake?
yes jesus christ is the best character in avatar and the world
4:39 i am in love
QUESTION BOYZ
Jake? 
That's the only name I can conjure up. And it has a question mark attached to it, so that's not a good sign.
Holy crap... 8:18, like, I glanced at the screen really quick and I definitely didn't read the word in the blue box as 'click' at first, and I was like, "what the heck is he trying to sell me!?"... I clearly see now that it does indeed say 'click'... 
I only remember Jake Sully
i can only because my name is Jake
theres no shrek questions smh
Please make Question Boyz a continuous thing. 11/10 would recommend.
Aaagh I would have totally been able to do it. Ive never seen Avatar but I do know the main character is Jake Sully. Idk WHY I know that but I DO.
I remember jake sully.
i only know the main haracyer i think its jake...sully? or something ik its jake
I know the wheelchair guy is jake
Is avatar the movie with the blue arrow and the flying chewbacca?
After hard thinking I remembered Banshee but it turns out those are the weird blue/green alien dragon pterodactyl bird monsters the blue people ride
This one is just crazy. I ONLY KNEW jack sully.
Can you name one character from avatar: Jesus Christ
it's weird I remember lines from that movie, I remember the plot and could describe any character, I own it and I've seen it three times but I could not name a character to save my life.
I fucking loved Jesus in Avatar!!!! The Best character in cinema history!!!!!
The only name I remember was the name of the red bird dragon thing, and its name was the Leonopterix
Wow, the challenge is actually rigged from the start lmao.
I could name only one, Sully
Yeah, you're right - I couldn't name anyone either and I've seen it 3 times
Jake sully
thoroughly enjoyed this
ayyy can we get more question boys???
Grace.

B o o m.
1. Blue Man
2. Blue Woman
3. Lt. Surge
4. Blue Man 2
5. 8 legged deer
I liked the movie for what it was, /shrug


I remember Jake Sully and Dr Grace off the top of my head. The girl I forgot, It's Ney-something.
Jake Sooleeeey
That whole time I was like, just say jake sully and then, when the last guy said it a was satisfied.
Is that Brock Baker?
"Can you name one Jacksfilms video"


"Your Grammar Sucks 102"

Jack is such a dad
7:07 top 10 farts
Now that I have the knowledge of a character from avatar I will be waiting for jack to ask me to say a avatar character
easy.

Aang
did that boy really say jar jar binks
Thumbs down, vid didn‚Äôt let me skip to the video, how rude!
she said jesus christ im dead
Aang, Katara... Oh wait.
I remember the TRAITOR Jake Soooly
‚ÄúHey um, remember that one blue guy?‚Äù
I guessed Jake Sullivan, I was close it was Jake Sully.  Would that have counted? Could I have won $5?
AVTARDS DETECTED.
Sadly I can üòñ
REEEEEEEEE, REEEEEEEEE, ITS THE SAME CHARACTER
I'm just gonna quickly watch Avatar in case this happens to me
5 money is a lot
Uh Aang,Katara and Toph? No? Bad joke i'll leave
JAKE SOOLY
If "Jake" counts I would have won.. If they were looking for Jake Sully I would've been outta luck entirely.
uhhh what's Avatar?




oh the one with the blue people
2:58 uHHHH THE BLUE ONE
I swear I knew Jake Sully before googling
I think I saw avatar 6 times in theaters so I‚Äôd win myself $5
a light switch
My favorite character from Avatar is Filthy Frank.
So I know Eric but who tf is the other eric? Eric's brother??? they look so similar
Jesus Christ = Jake Sully... close enough
Time to watch avatar again and make some memes
Jake, I think.  I'm pretty sure that's a guy in the movie.  Don't know anybody else.
(James Cameron has left the chat.)
Edit: I love the fact everybody is saying Aang from Avatar the Last Airbender, just shows how memorable & loved that show actually is.
My favorite character is avatar
Only character from avatar i know is jake sully
I only remember the main characters name which is jake sully
jake and (naytiri ?) that's all I remember from a movie I must have seen a thousand times
Jack makes a 9 minute video instead of stretching it to 10 minutes, careful his a hero
I thought he meant Avatar: The Last Airbender
They're called nd filters you always inside nerds.
JAKE SULLY GOD DAMN IT
Why does this guy still have 4.5 million subs?????
Me when i read the title:
The blue people movie or the good one






(I‚Äôm very much joking about a good avatar movie)
More question boyz please
Mad lad ended the video at 9:33
All i remembered was the wheelchair dude was john. turns out it was jake. oh
Damn! Nobody remembers Blue Pocahontas!
Well there's aang, sokka, kata- wait wrong avatar


wait someone already made that joke
Jack the try guy used your theme in there video it‚Äôs a beautiful day
I remember the game but I can't mam3 any of the characters
Papa Dragon
6:30 whatüòÇüòÇ
They could've just replied fast with a made up random name and it would've worked
Hey! I was there and I clearly noticed Jack because of his giant shiny forehead
I would have said Papa Dragon.
Titanic: Am I some sort of joke to you?
"Name one character from Avatar."
"Jesus Christ."
Oh, real nice, now if I don't give you the money I'll be smote with lightning from heaven, THANKS
I know Ripley from Alien was there
Honey probably gave you at least 15k for that giant ad and you didn't give away more than $10-15 in this video. Mr beast #2 over here.
‚ÄúuhhhhH DARK VADER‚Äù





WhAT
My favorite member of the Questions Bois is the thicker one
Was that worth all the hype?






HELL YEAH
this is craazzy! WOOOW
Erik Salvia is way better than you
The first guy to get Jake deserved money
8:01
I thought "Na'vi", but that's the species not any character.. :/
Had them ask me I would definitely say Cookie Monster. Why?

Because Avatar has a bunch of blue people. Cookie Monster is blue. There's gotta be Cookie Monster somewhere in the film.
Norm Spellman
Mike Sullivan?
To your question- yes, I can. 

..I just don‚Äôt want to.
I would like 5 moneys.
I woulda rocked this man. Avatar is my favorite movie uuuugh
Laurence of Arabia would have also been an acceptable answer.
Jake right?
Anyone actually know the plot to avatar
Only true Funhaus fans will know Jake Sully
Do i suck for remembering Jake Sully
Just here for daddy salvia
Jack: "Can you name one character from the movie Avatar?"

Me: "Uhhh... starts to sweat nervously ... uhhhh."
More question boys plz
JAKE SULLLYYYYYYYYY : )
Jake Sully and Neytiri are the only ones I remember.
jake sully, normand
John
There's a high chance there's someone named John in that movie.
Jake Sooooollllllllleeeee
This is what i subscribed for
Jake sully
Lol they all kept saying "Dark Vader" instead of Darth
I cannot express my elation
I actually knew Jake's name
Jake Sully and Nitiri.
My granddad Died today soooo






Dont smoke
Jake sully
Jake sully
Once I was talking to my cousin and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never met a single person who knows the names of a single character in Avatar.‚Äù My cousin named every single character in that film and its haunts me to this day.
Jesus Christ ‚õ™
JAYKE SOOLEE
"Dark Vader"
That other guy got the first name... that's very impressive! that's easily close enough. Or at least give him $2.50
Erik straight up giving us existential crisis
From memory, the main char is Jake someone and the girl's name starts with an N, think?
without watching the video or doing any research, Jake Sulley? i think
No way I could - first time my brain heard 'unobtanium' it noped right out of that movie!
So my mum loves it so much that I've seen it enough to remember ever word and can name probably all the named characters
Can‚Äôt wait for Question Boyz 2,3,4,5 and so on
What is thr point of this though ? I don't remember the name of characters in alot of movies I watched. I didn't watch avatar though.
Avatar is my favorite movie :(
I need more question boys
Trick question there are no characters
THE MAIN CHARACTER IS JAKE SULLY 




I actually remembered this cause the blue chick says his name with a funny accent
Yall don‚Äôt remember ma boi Jake?
Easy, Aang
Turuk Makto or smthn, was that one?
Jake Skully
6:30 "Can you name one charter from avatar"

Does anyone not remember Neytiri
I managed to name a few before the video started. How correct I am is a different matter.
silently thanks Dad for making me watch Avatar 3 times when we first bought it
silently stewing because I was not at Santa Monica bay to say Jake Sully or Neytiri üò°
Literally no one on Earth can name one of them. I bet even James Cameron can‚Äôt. 
It‚Äôs simple - no one cares about Avatar.
I'm 100% sure james Cameron just bought all the tickets himself
i dont get why noone even tried some common names theres probably a mike or jack or john in there somewhere
JAKE SOOLEE
Big money salvia. Generous with the 10 money
Sooo.... I'm waiting for the frame by frame analysis of the trailer now

#YIAYmad When Jack uploads a video and doesn‚Äôt include my comment in it
Hey Jack
I‚Äôm not gonna make a ‚ÄúYIAY 500 is an hour long her her YGS 100 see you in 2065‚Äù joke but instead I wanna offer some suggestions as to what you could do. 
The YIAYs I, as a viewer, enjoy most are the ones that take more time. FixPix, FixBio, Anime theme, etc. 
For YIAY 500 I think you could do 12 5-minute segments of those types of YIAYs. 


Example Schedule:
1. Roses are Red
2. Haikus
3. FixPix
4. FixBio
5. Write a song one word at a time
6. Speed Round. 3 questions. Top 10 taken from one, top 5 from the other, best of for the third. Alternatively, multiple Qs, top 10 for each shared rapid-fire
7. 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon but not with Shrek-with Emoji Movie
8. Outros?
9. YIAY Jeopardy (previous answers are clues. Play with Erin and Brock and that other YouTuber with the garbage dogs
10. 50 Amazing (Fake) Facts to Blow Your Mind
11. Best of YIAY LIVE. All previous winners go head-to-head in a one question match for the championship title. 
12. Write a script for Dicks on a Bench 3, one line at a time. 

Hope this helps! Maybe one segment could be an intermission with News in Haikus if you can‚Äôt think of anything (though I‚Äôm sure you could) 
#YIAYmad the thing that makes me mad the most is probably ‚Ä¶ the people who draw 100 dots but then dose 101  sigh.

HELP!
There's this video I watched a few years back. It's a short video, and it's quite abstract. I don't remember the title, but the video haunts me to this day.

There is a black background. In the video there are four men. One Caucasian man, one African American man, one Hispanic man, and one Asian man. Their faces are pretty blank throughout the whole video. The editing is stark and leaves a weird impression. If I recall, one of the men has a moustache. I remember them messing around with cardboard boxes, with words written in black Sharpie on the sides. 

There's a part where the men all pass around a basketball (there might have been more than one?) and there are other parts where they tap and put their hands on each other, making strange sounds. At one point, one of the men is eating chicken wings, and at another part one of them, I think?, is eating fried rice maybe? Then a black screen with the message "RACISM" appears. There are other instances in the video where this happens as well, maybe saying things along the lines of "CAPITALISM" and "GREED".

Unfortunately I can't remember the title of the video or the name of the channel that posted this.

If anyone has seen this video and knows its title, or the channel that posted it, please tell me.

Jack: has pewdipie background and attempts at an impression


still wears klondike merch
Why this is not Felix
1- His weird accent
2- He never wears hat except Pew News cap
3- The quality is too high

The accent cycles between German, southern English, and Indian, but never Swedish. Beautiful.
I'm swedish and I can confirm that this is how everyone from Sweden talks in English.
This is the worst and best impression of pewdiepie I've ever heard
This guy looks like Jacksfilms
Maybe worse. He could be Jacksfilms

Is this a green screen or did you break into his house
It was close but you missed one step, LOWERING THE QUALITY XD
I just watched a German PewDiePie advertise himself from a green screen of his own room

this is beyond science
its amazing what pewds looks like with a high camera quality, I now understand why he keeps it at low
My internet isn't the best, so the quality is really bad. And I thought that he was in PewDiePie's actual filming room.
Yes even he was helping...




But now its useless
The "don't we all" Rlly sounds like pewds in 0:39
Man must be painful to do that accent for a video
LWIAYIAYIAY should be the real acronym
(Edit) sorry my grammar sucks
Hey guys! Just put the quality down to 240p and it will be just like a pewds video!
Jack is German?!? (Gone emotional üò≠)
I feel offended by the accent and I‚Äôm American
This is an accurate impression
lmao this impression is so cringy and accurate at the same time idk how to feel
You sound like the midget from game of thrones wtf
Piller men: Awake from slumber
Jacksfilms: Lwiayiay
Nice try jack, video quality too high.
dude, this did not age well
this is such a bad impression, i love it!
Your accent bothers me but at the same time I find the impersonation fairly accurate.
It truly does look like he had broken into Pewds‚Äô room despite the green screen cut in the middle of the video.
But look at the underside of the lip of his hat.
It fizzles a bit, and you can see a faint outline is the background behind him.
He truly is using green screen.

Compared to his past videos where it was obvious he was using green screen, this is very impressive. I was ALMOST convinced he was actually in Pewds‚Äô room.
You can tell it is not pewdiepie because of the high quality of the video.
For a second i thought he was actually at his house

IS HIS SWEDISH ACCENT
I hate those people who are like.
"Pfft I don't even car and never did", pewdiepie isn't even funny"
This isn't just about liking pewdiepie or being #1. This is way more than that.
Why is his accent more like a german Rastafarian?!
So nobody is gonna point out that he is wearing two headphones
Nothin like some S M E X Y accent
Oh boy this is not going to age well at all
Make it pitch lasagna and make it about Math and angels and slope.
As a swede I can 100% confirm that all swedes have that accent.

Anytime he says "Of course!"

So now I'm subscribed to T-Series.

Last Week I Asked Yesterday I Asked You....To unsubscribe Pewdiepie cause he copied me!!
2018: They hated each other because of their fans thinks They were just copying each other

2019: JackFilms supported and subscribed to pewds to lose T SERIES
There are so any accents happening here and none of them are Swedish. Pretty sure I heard Jamaican in there somewhere. 10/10
umm quality to high
Can‚Äôt bamboozle me!
If this isnt featured in felix's next lwiay imma flip some tables
What even was that accent
Let's convince T-Series to buy Elon Musk and delete YouTube! Wait....
Why do you sound like you just invaded Poland
I was legit confused for the whole video before I released what happened
My favorite comment was at 1:21
B lasagna kidz bop version already exists, and grandayy made it

Why pewdipie have German accent?
Nazi confirmed.
Best jacksfilms video ever
Infinity war:I‚Äôm the greatest crossover

Lwaiyiayaiy: cracks knuckles
He sounds more Asian than Swedish.
That was a really terrible Goldmember impression
it sounds kinda indian
Loving the content, Pewds. Keep it up!
"Infinity war is the most ambitious crossover of all time."


Jack and Pewds:
i haven't watched any of you'r vids in a while and im hoping this is a one off
This hurt to watch
Thanks Jack!
nice headphones
I‚Äôve always wondered what it would sound like if a US, Jamaican, German and posh English accent would sound like if mashed together. Today that question has been answered
Wait what you're swedish
pewdiepie impression 10/10
Kinda sounds like Big Man Tyrone
My favourite yiay.. i mean lwiay
THANK YOU
That was an experience
acent wait that kidz bop john
Biggest cross over in history
Genius.
I have the perfect idea. He should become a fortnite streamer and amass a 9 year old army for real üòÇ
WARNING EU ARTICLE 13
What just happend?
Jack, I‚Äôve been a long time fan of yours, and I‚Äôve always supported you through thick and thin. But I have to say this video really crossed the line. Felix has worked so hard to deliver FRESH and ORIGINAL content  for his subscribers and for you to so blatantly rip off his idea of LWIAY for views is OFFENSIVE and OUTRAGEOUS. I am unsubscribing to you and  (since I am already subscribed to pewdiepie) making a second YouTube account and subbing to pewdiepie again. Also I am subscribing to Jenna Marbles and her dogs as punishment for your actions. I will return when you decide to deliver ORIGINAL content, like pewdiepie has done for years. 

Sincerely,

A disappointed nine year old.
this is felix had an accent
He sounds like the guy who played Freddie Mercury in bohemian rhapsody
He sounds Indian or something
T series has beaten our god
Cold Lasagna 
Cold Lasagna
T-Series ain't nothin but cold lasagna.
That impression tho
took me 1 minute and 46 seconds to realize he was impersonating pewdiepie
The accent hurt
Is he trying to sound like pewdiepieüòÇ
Felix looks different in this video tho... must be the Headsets
The accent is spot on my dude üò´üëÖ
He just became Irish.
Your terrible impersonation is üëåüëåüëå
Ok but has anyone tried sending thoughts and prayers?
Kids bop version : bop lasagna
No sponsor?
the impression was good at first then just got bad
Lol nice accent
The great opposite of Jacksepticeye's Pewdiepie impersonation..
I have watched this video about 100 times
Respecting pewds by placing vid quality to 240p
This is üëåüëåüëå
You sound like a German trying to speak English as a Jamaican
You grew the subgap by 25k in 4 hour wtf
You sound like hitler haha
what even is a t-series?
Why does John sound so Jamaican
Witch Savanna is the KIDZ BOP version.
You started at Pewdiepie and immediately fell into a weak Jacksepticeye impression.
do you need me to call someone
This accent made me cringe and die instantly
I could listen to this voice for hours
My ears have never hurt so bad
It took half the video to realise he was doing an impression of Felix
How much did he have to bribe you you for this one?
Does YiayLive still happen?
LWAIY sounds good Yaiy does oo
i knew it was a greenscreen when you hit the camera
pls dont do that accent again
Incredible move
You sound like Goooooooldmember.
What is this accent?
I didnt know felix had an accent until now
To be fair this studio looked beter and felt more real than Pewdiepies
Kidz Bop is a Bro officially
He sounds like flula
I like T-Seiries more
Insanety
Though you did steal the idea of LWIAY we 9 year olds sincerely thank you for doing your part.




Thank you Jacksepticeye, very cool!
It‚Äôs not 10 minutes
Start the K.K.K against t-series
U sound like that guy from frozen, who really wants u in his suana.
0:00 LWIAYIAY
Why does he sound like he should be narrating the lives of wild animals in Australia
Spectacular pewdiepie impression
I thought for a second he was at felix's house but then I saw it was at 1080p so it couldn't be his setup
lol i just noticed the background in 0:59
What is that accent?üòÇ
I was legitimately confused as to which channel I was watching for about 5 seconds. Great content. Keep it up
ok, real question: why does PewDieJack sound like Tommy Wiseau?
He sounds Indian
This camera quality is too good to be a LWIAY video
Who else came from the odd1sout
I get it Pewds is a Nazi

That‚Äôs why you have a German accent right?
Right
Is this YMS or YIAY?
Well this video did not age well oops
oh my god
This video was painful to watch.
That accent though
JACKFILMS a rich kid with too much time on his hands
Am I the only one here who is uhhh..... subscribed to T Series
That was dumb, and I loved it
the accent... Oof.
I think my ears need some antsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsantsants
Epic video but dont know about that swedish accent though
South African accent
This gave me PTSD
not gonna lie jack that was kinda cute no homo
anyone else think he sounds like Flula Borg?
I'm a simple man, I see a nice youtuber trying to help Pewdiepie and I sub.
I‚Äôm not mad
The levels of meta humor are high
I couldn't figure out it was a green screen until he showed it
Isnt that a lovely old German professor
I thought he was really on PewDiePie's setup but its green screen wow your an amazing editor
Why r so many people subbed to t series? How many of them are bots? I'm so confused??
oh my god
He‚Äôs trying to do a PewDiePie accent but he just sounds like flula borg üòÇüòÇ
Oh no jack is T-series spy
I thought I detected a twinge of Irish
1:13 I‚Äôm holding you to that Jack don‚Äôt disappoint me
Where i can get that headphone btw?
That definitely is and isn‚Äôt his accent.
I have no words to describe how much I hate that
Look at that hairline
DEMONITIZED
Jack is like a copy cat he cant think of original content XD so he steal videos Xd
i love your Swedish impression
because its absolutely rubbish
i didnt know felix had an accent
I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt accept you as a bro, you‚Äôve completely stolen his show and have copied him for years
Nice description.
It took me a solid 50 seconds to realize that he was in front of a green screen
Is it sad that I didn't realize that was a green screen until it cut to Jack on the plain green screen?
legend.
OF COURSE
jacksfilms + Pewdiepie accent = Trevor Noah...?
whats with the flula accent
Jacksfilms attempts to do Pewds impression but sounds like Flula, or even Jamaican instead.
you sound way too german
Fun fact : the sponsor was pewdiepie
Good job doing ur part!
accurate
Is that an Irish-German accent?
bro just shut up that intos cringey
I‚Äôm.... what?
Jack just broke inside pewds house to make this video.
You sound like a german scientist
was that a pewdiepie impression? honestly can't tell
not 30 fps
Leave your entries in the subreddit bros
This is just honestly terrible. What's going on with his new content üôÉ
that means Last Week I Ask You In A YIAY
9/10, not enough microphone involved.
We lost already
Stop. Just stop.
He sounds like Crainer lol
There is already a kids bop version. It's called witch savanna for all you uncultured out there. Like to become enlightened.
On how much gfuel were you while making this ?
What is voice
slow clap
OF COURSE
What is that accent tho
"infinity war is the most ambitious crossover in history"
nice accent john
Jack sounds more German than Swedish here.
Tf is this accent
Lend him your forehead for good luck
Jack did you forget to take your medicine?
his good guys, his doing his part
Nice accent
He sounds like an German lol
"because if you don't, I will" is a strong quote to live by.
Its over now
I'm still wondering how there's not any sponsor, yet it's got a tiny little bit of ... Actually no.
what is this accent
that was so good =)
How come we didn't just jump into it? ü§î
It's kind of ironic that no-one sponsored this yiay. Maybe it's because of lwiay
I‚Äôm proud of you John, no sponsor this time
He sounds like Flula
why can't i stop watching this help
You sound like you are being torn apart by Lisa, who you did not hit. 


Oh hi Mark
When did Jack become German
good try jack..... ur camera to good
Please do your pewdiepie voice more often
This channel is completely trash
You sound like a german who tries to do a British accent whilst really having to take a dump. Also thanks for supporting the 9 year old army.
Why is Brad 3 hosting LWIAY?
Spell that title  fast  out loud
When jack switching PewDiePie place
Tseries is nothing but a batch of lasagna
At least you tried to hide your forehead.
Lamo t-series already passed pewdiepie
Ohshit when'd Tobuscus take over Jack's channel?
That indian accent tho
i was 10 seconds in the only pewdiepie voice
He sounds like flula on crack lol
Well that was certainly one way of getting a million views
give up
you sound like seinfeld
walter
JACKSFILMS needs to Host MEME REWIEW
what's with the German accent?
Why does he sound Irish
I love that he tried to be swedish but ended up Nigerian
we lost...
Thanks, my dude. We needed that.
This is called breaking and entering
How did he ever get married?
Dang pewdiepie grew up
„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å® Jack
Couldn‚Äôt believe he broke in his own house! Epic!
It sounded vaguely like Felix at the beginning then it just went downhill from there
Was passed 5 times this week
1:41 i thought that's what you were going for
I mean I would sub but I ain't a fan of his content dude. Don't want that in my feed.
Now, the best Kidzbop version you'll ever hear 
 Peace Lasagna

Did anyone else notice he COPIED PEWDIEPIE‚Äôs SETUP
LWAIYIAY, SAY DO YOU REMEMBER. LWAIYIAY, DANCING IN SEPTEMBER
GREAT ATTITUDE KATE REALLY NICE.
If the last Y stands for YIAY, that means the full acronym is actually LWIAYIAYIAY.
Oh dear God, is that supposed to be Felix's accent?
Sounds like the german dude from Das Negro
Kidz bop makes Bean Lasagna
You sound kind of Jamaican and German at the start. I don't know if you tried to sound like PewDiePie but I just couldn't stop laughing throughout the video
Edit: Just realised his background is PewDiePie' s studio
T series ain't nothing nothing but Garfield's lasagna
speaks like a german. ww3 is apon us...
Since when is Sweden located next to Nepal ?
Reality can be whatever I want ,so I can delete T series
Eat lasagna eat lasagna my mom told me to eat lasagna
In 1080p, not the real pewdiepie.
What is that racist accent? I feel micro-agressed.
You sound like your high
He sounds like a white guy doin' an african accent... WAI A U RANNING
i spent the whole video trying to figure out what that accent is... also got excited bc background, then remembered greenscreens exist
Wow I actually thought it was pewd‚Äôs roomüòÖ
weiver emeM
We lost :(
Jack = üí©
Jack broke into Pewd's home, use this as evidence
How pew get suck a good camera?
dammit
Burnt Lasagna, Burnt Lasagna! T-s√©ries is nothing but a Burt Lasagna!
Time to sub to T-series, it seems.
I didn‚Äôt even notice that it was a green screen until 0:55
hmmm there is something wrong with that chair!
You better watch jawaban kalian and kepab
You sound German... Spot on
I would absolutely love Bitch Lasagna Kidz Bop version. You best believe it would be my next ring tone.
Game Theory: Jacksfilms is an Old German Professor??? (not clickbait)
ofcourse
That is a german accent
Sounds like someone from game of thrones
Is he doing an accent xD
His accent is SO badüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Aww I thought it was last week I asked YIAY
I want more LWIAYIAY
#yes
ASPITPIAY
It‚Äôs ironic that he sounds like he‚Äôs talking in an Indian accent
Last week I asked you in a yiay!!!
Very nice. But.. your camera quality is too good.
Wow he really traveled all the way to Felix‚Äôs house, wow
Looks like Jack ran out of ideas again
Jacksfilms does impression of jacksepticeye doing an impression of Pewdiepie
What is that atrocity of an accent....
You sounds like if jackscepticeye and gordan ramsay had a baby
That‚Äôs not Swedish lol. I dont know what it is, but it‚Äôs not Swedish
In this episode of LWIAYIAY, Richtofen teaches us how to save Pewdiepie while in a wind tunnel.
wtf is that accent supposed to be?
What is t series? Never mind, I don't care about either one,
what accent is that?
are you claus from american dad
I like how he slowly loses his accent as the video goes on.
Isn‚Äôt Lwiay just a more realistic YIAY?
The 9 year olds that don‚Äôt know they are friends be disliking lol
Bad accent
i hate the accent
JACK YOU FORGOT YOUR MEDS AGAIN!
SASUKE
The accent is so bad
You sound more like youre in holland
why the indian accent?
1:20 seconds in until I realized he was wearing double headphones

how u in pewdiepie room-yes i dont know
Me love it
What actually happened to yiay live?
Did jack finally break and cover up his forehead
KIDZ LASAGNA
As a Swede, this accent is TERRIBLE. good try tho, jack.
I like the acsent
But wouldn't it be LWIAYIAYIAY?
Stealing the top Youtuber's Original content again? Shame on you Jack.

And they said Infity War was the best crossover in history.
I will be waiting for that Kidz Bop B*tch Lasagna version
this crossover is better than infinity wars
You realize thats not a swedish accent right
I have an old German professor. Can confirm jack sounds like him
the accent went from Swedish, Indian, and then Irish and then went to an accent I don‚Äôt even know how to define
Omg that German??? accent. Far from Swedish anyway
any video with an awkward cutoff ending is a good video
Jacksepticeye please stop copying Markiplier!
why are u suddenly german
Thanks Jack, I hate it.
It's nice that you let PewDiePie host this episode, Jack!
where is this german accent coming from
LWIAY is better
Epic
Wait! pewdiepie have a second channel 





Very cool
Thanks I hate it.
We need bit*h lasagna kids bop john and you're the only one who can provide

This is jacksfilms trying to help pewds by totally ripping him off...........AMAZING!!!!!!!
That "FINALLY" was too real!
Hi
Green screen right?
Waiting for PewDiePie to react to this..
cant tell if it's Swedish or Indian accent.
Finally! The world's greatest YouTober did his part!
pulls out meat scepter

Lol too late
GIVE THIS OSCAR A MAN

You sound really german
People that disliked this love t-series




It hurt to even say 
Wait, just WAIT.... I'm loving the Flula impression.
What‚Äôs with the German accent
Nice.
He is not German you know..
great video! just by doing a trainwreck
Thank you PewDieFilms
if we all donate one dollar then pewdiepie can  buy youtube
we lost, ugh, well boys lets get back to the top
German Officers in 1945: "Soviet artillery is shelling Berlin and the Allies have crossed the Rhine, we have to negotioate peace!"
Hitler: "0:30 - 0:35"
Nice tv
Other people: Avengers Infinity Wars was the best crossover!

Me: Hold my beer...
Irish
I thought jackflims was in pewdiepie room
A pewdiepie video with 1080p WTH
You sound Indian
Wtf. PewDiePie, Mr.Beast, Grandayy, AND Jacksflilms all uploaded in within 30 min?
Uh yeah I have question. Is it ‚ÄúLast week I asked you I asked you‚Äù or ‚ÄúLast week I asked yesterday I asked you‚Äù?
1:20 jack wants to host content stolen from him
Kidz Bop Bitch Lasanga
Instead of Bitch Lasanga its
Frick Lasanga
Boi Lasanga
And Darn Lasanga
"and finally, by shooting up a mosque in new zealand! no! 0 IQ MOVE"
Hey, Jack. Have you ever heard a Swedish accent before?... Cause this ain't it
0:47
I know your dogs weren't in the video but I need an answer, what breed is your dog
Still waiting for Kids Bop " Bish Lasagna "
Is this supposed to be Jackspidecy impression?
Even though it‚Äôs Native American still don‚Äôt like having Indian in me üêä
What did I just watch? :O
that accent makes me want to kill myself john. why would you do this to me
I think pewdiepie dose the best jacksfilms voice at 0:45 and 0:57 and here 1:08 and 1:24
Plot twist: This is the real pewdiepi. The other one is Poppy Gloria impersonating him
Thanks I hate it
I had to check if it was Pewdiepie or jacksfilms (thank heck it was the latter)
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyüëè
is he still mad pewdiepie milk his original idea? XD
Ironic how he made Pewdiepie sound Indian
"I sound like an old German professor" thx jack now we can confirm that pewds is a Nazi
I... feel... pain.........
Why dose jack sound Indian
You sounds like an artist who fail at art school and decided gonna do a genocide
This was a "try not to click off challenge"
Who even cares about subscriber numbers these days?
pewdiepie got beaten
F in chat for Pewdiepie
Truly wish that jack had better taste in friends. Absolutely wish that he did not promote racists but here we are
LETS GOOO BOOOISSS SAVE PEWDIEPIE!
LETSAAA GOOO MY MEATBALLSSS
Oo you also have The same background -.- Like Pewdiepie
Huh, Felix is looking off today. Hmmmmm...
....im subbed to tseries pls don't hurt me....
You sound Indian, are you T-Series ?
:(
if pewds goes don so will jacksfilms (and maybe a smaller channel called YuB who basically jokes around being like pewds)
Why tf is he wearing 2 sets of headphomes?????
the camera looks better in than pewd's one
Jack: Makes Pewds sound like a bad english impersonation

Me: Why does it kinda work?
Wot
1:30 he legit almost sounded like pewds there
I legit thought this was PewDiePie
:))))))
Jacksfilms joins the battle!
What accent is this?
Why are we still here....... Just to suffer.........üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
nuke India
Your voice is gay
We, 9 year olds finally forgive you for stealing the concept of LWIAY after this video....!
I dare you to fix the flag of uae in a video
nice vid jake
no
jack where are you being held blink once if you need help oh god
Kids lasagna
Kids lasagna
T series ain‚Äôt eating his Tasty Lasagna
lel
Now we lost
no
This is the worst Pewdiepie impression I've ever seen in my life and I love it with all of my heart.
Thank you Jack for doing your part.
Or maybe we could pretend to work for t-series. Hack their youtube account then delete their channel.
Dat accent is a bichy one haaaha
well you copied fidget spinner glasses, and LWIAY (you call it YIAY), and now the frikin' copier stands up for the one he copied, how dumb can you be? that is the reason i hate you, cuz yo dumbbbbbb
this sounds like a weird african accent
I LOVE THIS



Is it bad that I thought this wasn‚Äôt green screened ( is that good English?) eH I don‚Äôt know
How did lwiayiay come
Honestly thought pewdiepie just had a weird voice until this morning when I realized it's an accent
Who else thought that Jack actually was in Pewds room at first
earlier today i actually started making a version called bad lasanga. it's bitch lasagna but wholesome and on the ukulele.
John you need to host a meme review but say meme big boy when clapping
Though this was pewds video then i realized that the video was 1080p
Who's here when PewDiePie ended the memes
Not only did you copy LWIAY of my favorite youtuber, you also copied YIAY of my other favorite youtuber, give it up you old German Professor, get your own content! Like summoning dead Hitler for example.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre dangerously close to losing the number one spot‚Äù
Again
He sounds like what I expect that one image of Indian pewdiepie would sound like if he was German
PewDiePie vs T-Series in a Nutshell
Pretty good green screen.  I thought you were actually in pewd‚Äôs office
i love how jack tried to sound like swedish viking...
MUCH APPRECIATED!
Why is pewds German?

Wait...
This isn‚Äôt funny anymore jack....we‚Äôve lost.
Why do you talk like that?
After watching twice, just noticed the bavkground is pewds setup
Sounds like a mix between Pewdiepie and the Dutch guy from Austin Powers.
He's doing his part. Now do yours!
His pewds impression just had me laughing the whole time
Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if Pewds hosted YIAY and Jack hosted LWIAY?
why does is he sound like hitler
I hate this voice
Jack has gone insane after YIAY was stolen, he has transcended into a clone body of Felix
Why is he German
At first I was wondering why Jack sounded weird, and then I realized that really sounded like pewdiepie wtf
His actual Pewdiepie voice sucks but he's got his mannerisms down and its really impressive.
Such a copy cat
He sounds like my Turkish art teacher
I‚Äôm wearing the same head phones
Im 15 and this is deep
LIWAY
this is a total rip off of lwiay, can't you come up with something original Jack?
Someone please help Jack, he had either lost it or gained awareness, please be that he's lost it
Can‚Äôt believe jacksfilms copied lwiay.
It took till the end of the video to realize that he was in Pewds room üòÇ
i‚Äôm swedish and this accent is the literal worst i have ever seen
966,370th view
It took until the green screen stopped working for me to realise that your background is pewdiepies room
i can not still believe that people dont know that LWIAY is a Replacement of Fridays With PewDiePie. its a true fact after Pewdiepie made LWIAY videos he instantly stopped Fridays With PewDiePie and it is sad. so yeah.
Acent wait that very racist
Hur Hur
I'm sorry. But I don't suport Pewds. I guess I'm a fake-fan now...
We don't like you T-series. 
Nothing personnel, kid.
But we must go all out, just this once.
Kidz bop or Kidz bop whichever will it be?
Please just sit down T-series we're here to spill the real tea
Trying to dethrone pewds his spot on number 1?
You're India, you lose, so best think you haven't won
When we're through with you we're gonna determine it is done
'Cause we only just begun
We review you  Bye nerd gone!

Jack, you are super funny and cool. I love your content but please do not support wish. The products on wish are cheap because they are made poorly and often fall apart/dont work. Especially the cosmetics. They come from places that have no health regulations. There's actual rat poop and heavy metals in that make up. Im slightly disappointed in you. I guess a paycheck is a paycheck

Wish as a sponsor turned me off a little tbh
YIKES, not sure how to feel about jack promoting wish.... everyone knows how low-quality and garbage their products are. And I won‚Äôt even begin on how they exploit child workers in China.. maybe reconsider promoting them in the future.
you can't fool us jack we watch safiya's videos
Wow this is the first time comments have overtaken future yiay answers and most are saying how bad wish is... That's a sponsor to drop
Looks like ol' John got himself into trouble beacause of a sponsor again
i honestly thought he was joking when he's sponsored by wish.
Considering the price points of Wish's products, I genuinely doubt they are sourced by ethical companies. I fear that some of the products on wish are the consequence of child labor or other cruel employment methods. Wish is also notorious for scamming people, and products are often different than what was expected. I genuinely believe this Wish sponsorship is a mistake and I hope Jack takes ownership for it. Additionally, please do not consider buying from Wish! I adore Jack's videos regardless, but felt it was important to provide insight into this sponsorship in order for growth to be achieved from this error. I hope you have a nice day!
I liked the video but I can‚Äôt support the fact that you were sponsored by wish. Please look into your sponsors more next time.
jack, wish is literally a scam. and most of this stuff is made in sweatshops
Liked you more when you only let trustworthy companies that don‚Äôt scam people sponsor you honestly I‚Äôm disappointed
No! Do not buy makeup from Wish! They're all fakes and are not safe to use!
Bet they approached back in june of last year cause their shit take forever to get anywhere lol
nah man just use Chewy.com, usually cheaper than most pet stores but quality stuff.
Jack wish is a scam, love you tho.
Worst sponsorship ever.... don't use it just go on Amazon
wish is uhhh not great lol. i wouldn‚Äôt buy anything too expensive. i use wish a lot but never anything too flashy or expensive. i got a pair of shoes once and they were very flimsy and broke very quickly. if you do use wish i wouldn‚Äôt buy anything electronic or for beauty
Wish literally sells crackpipes and the users typically scam people
Wish is horrible! I thought you were better than that!
I love how nobody likes the sponsor.

No one is going to comment about so I will
#YIAYtube why those unskippable ads‚ÅâÔ∏è
As people have already said, Wish is an extremely harmful company. No regulation on ingredients, quality is cheap, customer service is non-existent, and above all else, the prices indicate it's almost definitely made by exploitation of the poor in other countries. I would not recommend supporting them.

Jack, wish is notoriously terrible...
Why would you take that sponsor money...
4:04 uh ah ah ah ah
With Wish, you can buy 10x as many things... and they break 100x faster! what a deal!
wish is paying a lot for sponsorships, even GMM did one. And yes, they did get criticized for that.
Unique things you never would have thought of.

Kinda disappointed to see a Wish sponsorship. A LOT of the stuff on Wish is cheap low-quality knockoffs presenting itself as the real deal. It's super dodgy and to be honest I think the fact that you'd do a sponsorship with them kinda discredits your other sponsors.

Hey Jack, just so you know in future, I wouldn't promote the makeup on wish. I know they probably told you to mention the makeup but it's very very very often fake versions of makeup which frequently contain really harmful ingredients and can cause damage to your skin, eyes and lips. Some lip products have contained poison and a lot of fake eyeshadows have been found to contain animal faeces. Pls don't promote wish makeup. Ok that all thanks for listening to my tedtalk

It's really awkward that so many people are jumping on the Wish train. It's a really dodgy app lol sometimes you don't get the thing you bought, or it's such shitty quality it's clearly a knock-off. The app is full of the "free just pay for shipping" scams that have been going around especially with the beauty community, Tana and Gabby were hauled over it last month.. yeah it's dodge as hell.

You best be careful with buying from wish. Dog toys and costumes, sure, but some of the makeup and clothing is just a straight rip off with hidden fees. Some of the makeup often contains toxic chemicals, and even actual feces.

#YIAYtube  entertainment at its finest.
$2,000 could get you over a million Dogecoin. If it hits a penny you'd have $10,000. That's an $8,000 profit.

Even $300 would be a great investment. When there's a bull run and the price goes way up, you can sell a piece, hold the rest, and buy even more with your profit when there's a price dip.

That's the beauty of Dogecoin, you can get a lot for a little bit of money, and your return on investment potential is through the roof. More people just need to get on-board and more businesses and services need to adopt Dogecoin as a method of payment. 

So get Robinhood or get on Yahoo Finance, use whatever money you can to buy as much Dogecoin as you can and hold it. Don't let yourself get discouraged by price drops or slow markets. Patience is the key!
#YIAYtube Yaa it's rewind time

#YIAYtube Oops, your monetization‚Äôs gone
#YIAYtube aND tODaY's sPOnSoR iS...!!

Not Adsense...even as just a viewer you can see that the YouTube algorithm is killing small creators and screwing over people who are already quit their jobs in order to make an established career on this platform. It's almost a coin toss whether or not you'll make it. People exploiting the system can make more money in a day than some people can over months of hard work. And it just goes unnoticed by the bigwigs in charge. This has become a place of communities and it was made possible for people to make a living in here as creators with passions and use it as an outlet for their hobbies and pay their bills with it at the same time! But it's coming to be less and less accessible and while there are upsides there are so many hardships the people working here have to go through, and things that aren't often their fault. Demonetization can kill even channels that strive to be family friendly, and are more appropriate that some advertisers on the site. I feel awfully pretentious and like I don't know what I'm talking about lol but even I know these are real and pretty crappy issues creators on this site have gotta deal with which sucks since it could be an amazing place to thrive as a creator but some people rlly just get the short end of the stick. Good on all the people that keep trying though.
Were is the Yiaytube bro
Posts toe, gets demonetized.

#YIAYtube Bad sponsors of Jacksfilms
youtubers begging for monetization (i know its like 17 days since the vid but i did it anyway.)
that wish sponsorship had sme so put off i almost didn't watch out of not wanting to support anything to do with that. wish is super sketchy. i hope he researches it a bit after this and finds that out for himself
I love you jack but getting paid to promote wish isn‚Äôt cool bruh. Not only do they take advantage of child labor and other unethical practices to make their products so cheap but half the time if you order stuff you don‚Äôt ever get it. Don‚Äôt encourage your fans to get scammed just for a paycheck from wish my man

You have way too many laptops from sponsorship deals to possibly use them all
That video you edited of Buddy (the dog) made tears come out of my eyes. I hope he is doing good for himself.

6:19 Goddammit I‚Äôm crying. My lil boi Riley is gettin‚Äô on in age and idk how much longer he‚Äôll be around for (he‚Äôs 10).

I only put my first dog, Abby, down like...5 years ago? I decided to go along so I could comfort her with my mom (because my parents are divorced and my mom remarried so obviously my dad didn‚Äôt come), and my sister was going to college like an hour and a half away and she couldn‚Äôt come. And honestly I think it kinda traumatized me? Idfk. 

Anyway I‚Äôm in college now so I‚Äôm not home much anymore and I‚Äôm really afraid I‚Äôm just gonna get a call someday that he‚Äôs gone or something and I won‚Äôt even get to say goodbye.
Awesome thumbnail XD
I don't think I've laughed at anything as hard as I just laughed at that "scary honeymoon" trailer. Thank you Jack :')

Tfw you're so woke you re-invent the flip phone
Please tell me you removed the battery before making this video. If not, you were risking getting seriously injured the whole time.
Watching this with headphones is torture.
Close enough to the real thing
I dont know...

The screens dont continue down the sides...
Bro imagine how cool it would be to play Minecraft Pocket Edition on that!
So in my opinion... do I think is worth it??? YEEEET
Were is the galaxy fold?
ASMR people should use this new model as a tingle trigger :O
Wasn't sure about buying or not, but that final "Ye" helped out greatly. Thank you Mr. BigforeheadFilms. üòò
This is not a Galaxy F but a Tab A 2017!!!
And now how im going to have a screen protector 


Wait i have tape i can tape the screen and now its protected wow
The galaxy fold has 2 batteries, so double the explosion!
The hilarious thing is this is exactly what happened to all the reviewers
Can we get Jack to host LWIAY and Pewdiepie to host YIAY?




Attempt #6
@1:22 Do I think it's worth it? yea
Listen to feel good .inc kidz bop version






For 10 hours

Ahhh. Just the ASMR I was looking for.
Today's fact: Robert Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's son, was in close proximity to three out of four presidential assassinations.

JACK THE HANDYMAN CAN WE FIX IT

I think you folded it the wrong way
Thanks jack! This is a really great review, and I will get it whenever I can. Your very trustable!

But I don‚Äôt understand the hammer?.. does that come with the phone..?
"The world we live in... Its so wondrous, mysterious even magical. No no no not that world." - The Emoji movie opening scene
Yes indeed it does 2k even tho the Mate X cost like way much more
lol this video was a prophesy!
Samsung, sponsor him now!!
Jack casually flexing
It's definitely worth it.
9 times out of 10 the construction work you hear in the morning is actually someone folding their Galaxy Fold.
absurd boast but i‚Äôll oblige
Okay but does it have animoji?
Lmfao he bent the ipad and called it a galaxy fold haha
Do I think it's worth it?


Ye
The galaxy with an apple logo on the back. Yup sounds legit.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hey Jack!

Jack:This is a Samsung phone 
Phones back:Apple logo
DAMN BOI
It looks amazing how much is it?
I just died when he hit it with the hammer üòÇ
Sees bitten apple on the back
Hm, weird idea to stick apple's logo on samsung. Weird flex but OK.
My 3ds does everything this phone does plus it‚Äôs in 3D and its a fraction of the price. 

Eat that Nokia
Ain't April 1st chief

I almost disliked this video and then I realized it was Jack
I love that cracked wallpaper! Looks so real!
I like the background on it that looks like shattered glass
You forgot that Galaxy Fold Has Twitter for Android
$2000?? No... I say...





$2000000 10/10!!!
Very well done review. Clear and quick keep it up!
,
You sound like The Verge when you talk
The ihammer comes seperate at a price of 150$ and it has wireless charging.
Nokia was first
Thanks for the review looks really slick, I like the aesthetic of the Android Gloves you're using also
You can't yield a hammer.








Thor is disappointed.
Woah! I like Samsung's new apple logo!
Does the phone come with the gloves and hammer
I didn't get the notification ;`(
You're Jack the son Lucifer
I got a samsung ad before this.

He did his research
Flip phone: exists
Galaxy: INTRODUCING THE VERY FIRST EVER FOLDABLE PHONE!
Flip phone: am I a joke to you?
Didn‚Äôt know it had the apple logo.
Neat.
That‚Äôs so neat how phones now fold!
I wish my flip phone did that!
Shoulda posted it on @pril 1st
Best Click Bait I ever seen!
My Nintendo DS already folds, beat that üòé
Jack: Folding the device is very simple
backround hammering
Great Video, Jaquel!
You look like my gay librarian at the end üòÇ
The kind of content I subscribed for.
I'm not even kidding I got an ad for the Galaxy S10+ before this video.



That's hot lol
3.8k triggered apple fans
Wow what a nice phone!
im planning to buy it but is it from apple or samsung
This never appeared in my sub box or notification

0:27-0:29 New Samsung logo leaked

I live having broken glass in my pocket 
It always comes in handy
Y is there an apple on the back?
0:29
WTF AN NINTENDO SWITCH AD!???!!?!?!?
My wallet hurts just watching this video.
With the sarcasm aside, this is actually good asmr
you know that samsung released a new patch for all samsung devices that alows them to bend right
i personally think it's gay
And one selfie cam on the outside üòÇ
1:20 don't pull off the screen protector man
‚ÄúPerfomance is very snappy.‚Äù
Weird flex but okay.
love that i got a galaxy ad on this
3 words, BEST PHONE EVER!
I really like your background!
12gb is complete overkill üòÇ
Tap this to get galaxy fold
üëá
"Do I think it‚Äôs worth it?"
"yi"
That was a solid burp at the end
The only reviewer I trust...
Anyone notice the apple logo

My god üòÇüòÇüòÇ whenever I need cheered up you never fail to make me crack up
2 Jacksfilms videos in one day?! This is the prophecy!
Hey I didn‚Äôt know Apple made galaxy phones ü§î
Satisfying-

Yee
pfft, it's obvious apple pioneered this idea over 5 years ago
[Includes paid promotion]
I feel so flexed on..üò¢
Samsung phone
Has apple logo on the back
The price of the acctual one will keep my wallet folded
Apple has left the chat
i'll take your entire stock!
techrRax can copy strike this video
The screen looks about as broken as the fold screens are now tbh
I tried to fold my phone before.. I broke my back
This isn't Marques Brownlee
Best vid in the world
It kinda look a lil broken
Positive review mate
Best use of an apple product I have seen to date.
Me: folds phone 

Phone: baby don't hurt me
BUt Do I ThInk iTs WorTh It





Ye
I like how the ending was reminiscent of those primitive DIY videos. So... foldedly fresh.
YOU BROKE THE PHONE YA WEETARD
Wow........ So beautiful
I didn't know samsung & apple did a collab together
Thas a noice üì± u got deir
I love the style of the stylus on the side, really nice feature
Is this a really early April Fool's joke?
Is it worth it? 

Jack: yeh
At least it didn‚Äôt explode.
Rare footage of Jack going outside before another year of editing.
Wow Click Bait That I enjoyed
This is a Apple iPod
üëèphone üëèreview
Audible money well spent
Holy flip that was some great wallpaper for that phone tho
Weird flex but ok.
12 GB ram lmao
Jacksfilms is How to Basic. Confirmed.
Marques Brownlee has left the chat
"hands-on"
wears gloves
Thanks for helping me out what to buy üòä
I know the phone is fake but, as a mobile app developer, seeing you treat it that way makes me uncomfortable.
In a year, I will edit this comment.
Yea, but you can‚Äôt beat folding a paper.
The fact that jack was hitting the iPad as if he had never picked up a hammer in his life adds so much to this video
Literally every phone review ever on youtube
...
Did Jacksfilm make a sketch in 2019???
Wierd flex but okay
I liked the part where he folded it
You‚Äôre flexing on us, Jack.
Need asmr folding pls
That looks beautiful



if only i could afford it
Legit just found out that was an ipad lol
Ahhh just the husband material Erin was looking for
Just got the notification for this
simply amazing
Thanks, this is the most I've ever cringed. Ever!
seems legit :)
You broke a perfectly good porn machine just for this video
a true mechanic hacker
i think this is fake
it's really thin
Hey this in not an samsung foldable phone
Thats a hammer
Subtle TechRex parody, he reviews a phone whilst broken
you are bending it the wrong way Jack, such a rookie mistake
jack should really do more technology reviews
I miss the phones with the slide out keyboard.
i thought he just stole the hammering clips, but he actually made them himself






what a madlad
Most awkward mic hold ever
It this Tech Rax?
I see you're into recycling.
Weird flex but ok?
Are the gloves necessary, or can you use it without them?
Erin should be proud
can you giveaway this Galaxy Fold?
What are you tech rax
Hands-off review required too
The Galaxy Fold has nothing on the Nintendo 3DS
greatest man alive
I got a galaxy fold ad
This might have been one of those things where he needed proof the iPad was broken for the company to send him a new one.
Oh man I love techrax
I always wondered when jacksfilms would become a tech destruction channel.
Can we stop this asmr mic thing? I really dont watch anymore becouse of it.
I feel like just watching this video, I have residue glass in my eyes
i wonder who broke first Galaxy FOLD üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•
Waw what a cheap but quality review
Wow. Technology is advancing so fast. Today truly is the future
Lmao.... Your hilarious. I‚Äôve watched this video three times and laughed out loud every time.
I can't wait for PMS 300

Gotta admit, that‚Äôs a great wallpaper!
U broke an ipad for this
here's my well deserved like
you know you can use a mic stand
Interesting microphone shape there.
Sounds WAY more satisfying than peeling the plastic seal of of it.
Your gloves in pov look like the guy from apex
does it support air pods?
Yeah... good luck shoving that in your pocket... üòÇ
Weird flex but ok
I like the bit where he shows the internal components, you know.. when he carefully removed the screen revealing the lcd and how it‚Äôs very flexible. I‚Äôm actually convinced to buy one!

: I‚Äôm guessing Fortnite and Screen protectors will work well too, not to mention.
Beautiful Device
Imagine having the money to waste like this  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
htts://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tPqdlDba99Q 

My idea shared with Samsung  back in the early noughties & published on YouTube in 2017, Original blueprints sent to the CEO of Samsung via email, with a reply stating they had no plans to ever release such a device, my design was based Originally on a S3/4 with a later design based on the then S6, & my idea/ design was called the Samsung Fold.. I a long time user of Samsung, but the completely ripped off my idea..
Any smartphone is foldable with enough force, what makes Samsung special
Jack Flexing on us for a minute and thirty seven seconds
When that phone has more ram than your pcüíÄ
It‚Äôs an iPad Mini guys take the joke! My godüòÇ
Notice the Apple logo
sees Apple logo on the back
tfw you put the case on your hands instead of the phone
and one (1) selfie cam on the outside
twitter for android
OH "SNAP"
The devil works hard but jackfilms works harder
Do I have to pay for a burping forehead to fold my phone just like on the commercial as well?
Haters say it's fake
The dislikes are from the people who cant get used to new Phones
Jack thinks he is funny
I like how the Galaxy fold has an apple logo
Samsung Sponsorship has left the chat
Subtle flex
Wow this is definitely a must have!
Jack's version of primitive building.
I don‚Äôt have arms so can you do a hands off review?
I hope in the future the price tag would be the only joke
SKETCHES ARE BACK BABY WOOOOO
What a strong message.. üòÇüòÇ
Y‚Äôall are late... I be flexing my blackberry

The apple is on the back because we need equality
the screen is almost as big as jack's forehead
This monster must have 4k
Even the wallpaper looks so realistic .. thanks iCrap
I actually got a Samsung ad after the video. I thought it was a joke like the ‚ÄúGrinch ads‚Äù were so I rewatched it. Nope. An actual Samsung ad

this video is a flex
Good to know now I can buy and put one in my small ass pockets the make for females
In my experience, it's been great. The only issue i have is that when i fold it the device cracks and turns off. If anyone knows a possible fix, that would be really helpful, tnx.
Im sorry jack but this video caused me pain




Prepare to get me me big boyed
looks good, might buy later
I'm gonna faint
I like the aesthetic of the cracked screen. Gives the phone it‚Äôs own look, and also helps with multitasking by giving you multiple pieces of the shattered screen to work on XD!
Hey I just watched the burn out video and dude yiay is amazing and thank you for not destroying yiay and your videos are amazing you are amazing
0:27 hey they got a new logo!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Did no one teach jack lithium is explosive?
Ahh, the wonders of technology.

Now you can never walk again in your backyard barefoot.

0:28 Apple Galaxy Fold
I got a Mountain Dew ad before the video
I have an I pad mini AND I WATCHED THIS ON IT
Already bought it
Why are you married to Erin.
gotta love how it's an ipad he's breaking
Good job spoiling the joke in the thumbnail and forcing me to waste 1 minute and 37 seconds of my life, unsubstantiated
VERY helpful! My grandson wants to know how long the battery is!?
and its very snappy
THIS LOOKS EPIC 


REALLY WORTH THE 2000$
weird flex, but ok
Nice to see the preview of the foldable phone
Thank you jacksfilms very cool
and one more thing
You r so handsome and cute:)
I cant wait for the upcoming ipad mini twist
YIAY
YIY
Why
Can you review a small mic that you can clip to your shirt, so you can stop using that dumb rode mic?
The shape of your microphone and the way you hold it.. is disturbing..
I accidentally liked the video when I was trying to open the description so I just want you to know that I didn‚Äôt like it on purpose but I‚Äôm gonna leave it there for charity purposes
It's an apple tablet lol
Hopefully Tech Rex watches this.
Alright quit flexing your ‚ÄúYouTube money‚Äù on us
PMS every monday
looks like a jerryrigeverything review
That‚Äôs the iFold, Jack. You lied to us. Next time, buy the actual Galaxy Fold.
A killin' part 1:06
MKBHD has left the chat
That's probably what apple users are doing after watching the fold ad
Did you try rice
Would you mind checking out my thumbnail's and saying how they are

This is stupid...






This is the content I subscribed for

No. Go home
Dummy tHICC
Is this supposed to be a hidden ASMR video? 



I see what you did there...

This video makes me want to buy one because of the display
No ipads were harmed in making that video
I'm wheezing
Hey! Give me my tablet back!
Damn that crease
Imagine being rich enough to break an iPad like that just for a minute and a half skit lmao 
No hate, I love Jack. Just very much strange to see lol
PHONE REVIEW üëèüëè
And apparently has a Apple Logo.
This video made me feel very uncomfortable...
Despite the joke scenes, it's an actually good review
Oh Yeah Yeah.
Two videos in one day? Jack must be dying and trying to get the rest of his vids out.
I thought it was Samsung but it has apple logo in the back üòî
Can't wait for mine to arrive! :D
Love that he destroyed a plebian Apple product for this video üòäüòä
he had to use special gloves on the phone.
Airpod users: I dont speak b-
Galaxy Fold users: sorry, what?
I don't understand the purpose of this video but i like to watch apple getting smashed
Who else got a Samsung add before this video
You can twitter it in android
He just destroyed an ipad
But jack, how are you gonna "Twitter for andriod" without your old phone? >:^(
Why di I see an ad on this vid of a guy saying wee wee
It's not a Galaxy Fold. It's iFold mini.
cries in korean
Says it is a galaxy. Apple logo on the back
as soon as I realised it was apple I was so happy.
Unintentional asmr?
Performance is very snappy
Bruh I ordered one of these and it came broken smh
it‚Äôs an apple fold!
Android for Twitter
Actually, I'm pretty sure that's a Nokia
I think the sound made when he folds and unfolds the phone could go to good use in ASMR videos lol üòÇ
Damn drugs .hahah
Luigi Is Reviewing The Galaxy Fold Phone. Now I Have Seen Everything

Nintendo's new DS looks pretty good
the crunching sound of the glass is very soothing
No! I remember you using that old iPad- er- Galaxy Fold since 2016! :(
Why so many dislikes. Guess no likes honest reviews.
Notice it‚Äôs a iPad 1:09
I'm watching the video while scrolling down the comment section and for a second there I thought this was a real review.
Theres a bitten apple on the back of that samsung ü§î
jacks neighbors have friends over wtf is he doing?? oh don‚Äôt worry it happens all the time
They need to bring back the flip phones
I don‚Äôt support tech destructions channels
Neither funny nor Techrax level destruction...pointless video.
I think you should get a case for it see a little crack on that 4 inch screen
Can I order this on Amazon?
Is the forehead fold coming soon?

Beautiful review. I‚Äôll be sure to buy it because of you.
Well, there goes your Samsung sponsorships

Lol that was funny bro
That‚Äôs cool that it folds but can it

ITS AN IPADD
The display is soo good even the shattered glass wallpaper looks soo real
Its a ipad bro
Microphone lookin like a deeck
I don't know if I can keep up with all these innovations, the phone looks absolutely gorgeous as well!
i love Samsung's new logo!!! üòçüòçüòç
Apple need to up their game and bring in iphone orange
1:12 its a apple i pad mini
The video itself didn't make me laugh, but the Samsung End-Roll did.
I'll love to play geometry dash and flappy Bird at the same time!! I can't wait!!
It comes broken so you dont have to worry when you drop it
Yes i got a samsung ad on this video
12GB of ram is necessary when you need to keep all 200 porn tabs running in the background.
Jack, who hurt you?
GaLAxY fOlD (at 3:am!) gone wrong!
This is clickbait its an ipad
watching this gives me so much stress
When you have so much money that you destroy an ipad for minute long sketch.
What are the odds that I get Samsung ads in the beginning and the end of the video?




Actually it‚Äôs pretty high because Samsung just released their new phones
yay i see space jam as a movie
....and iphones are still more expensive.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

I saw an Apple logo!
This guy still makes videos?
Is that an ipad pro 3? Cuz it beat SAMSUNG to being the 1st foldable tablet
And the scratch test?
Dude that mic üò¨
Jack pulled a Scarce with that double upload for today
Go sub to xvpython he does cool fortnite compilations of him playing
Did anyone hear Klondike in the background
Apple Gold xD
Tried rice?
Galaxy fold: $1980
iPhone XS + iPad Pro: $1800
Ad from Samsung S10 before the video? SAMSUNG must've loved the modifications you did with that tablet.

Laptops : Am I a joke to you

This happen when you can't get your hands on 2k phone
Screen looks a little dirty, but I think I will still buy
Im getting so educated right now
I'm so glad to see the screen quality is still better than android
Flip phone am I a joke to you
Brilliant
New iPhone fold
Cool Mystery Video
Apple is going to do the same design and put a higher price tag. Mark my words everyone...
Are you shure that's not a apple tablett, that your'e breaking? Sorrry for the spelling...im Lithuanian.
Would you just admit that you are how to basic already
This man clearly doesn't know how to use a hammer......
Wait... that was an Apple product!!
pretty early, hey jack, the phone is breathtaking.
Where can I pre order
Good dog owners always leave broken glass and plastic in their yard. Its nutritious and helps build immunity and tolerance
lots of people got mad while watching this.
I think I'll pass. I'm gonna buy the vastly superior Soulja Phone instead.
Folding is very simple. All that is required is a simple Hammer, purchasable at the local Home Depot.
not enougfh fornight
0:28  hmm  apple???
I like 1:12 when it shows an apple logo
Dang me i cant even afford an apple

You copied this is Tech today
Ok ok, I just want to know, can it run Roblox
This is not a galaxy fold
This is a broken iPad mini
I would rather get the iPhone 6 it is cheaper and it is foldable alsoüòÇ
can it run angry birds?
I was laughing as soon as I saw this thumbnail.
Looks just like a regular iphone
Beautiful
scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7
#ad
he missed the opportunity of saying ‚Äú are there any cracks ????‚Äù when he dropped it
HA android. Broke
Really cool wallpaper, where can I download it?
Perfect
I think it's weird that he actually just sold me on a device that doesn't exist and is just a broken I pad mini. Like I genuinely want this to exist
When you said 12 Gigs of RAM, I was expecting a clip of you going: "RAM, RAM, RAM, RAM, RAM"
The price in my opinion is the only problem with it
0:28 Also a new feature: a Apple logo =D
Flip phone.
who else thought this was jerryrigeverything
Why do you need gloves if its a hands-on review?
Does it have a headphone jack?
nice hammer, where'd ya get it??
i'd bought it before, id give it 5 stars, great performance, great look, and AMAZING display, also the 12 gigs of ram is KILLER
How did he get it early
This is fake because it has an apple logo
So i had an SAMSUNG GALAXY ad before the video.
Could you put the mic somewhere and not hold it? Good god.
New Galaxy Foldable Phone

I didn't find anything wrong in this beautiful foldable phone, until I noticed the fruit symbol on the back, which clearly means this isn't a Samsung phone, but a Nokia. I am TIRED of you lying to the audience, Jack. I want my 4k dollars refund back, you thief
MY EARS
God, I love satire. And Jacksfilms.
Rip ipad

Jack holding that mic all the time is starting annoy the shit out of me for reasons I can't even explain.

This video was sponsored by Apple

A child in Africa could have eaten that ipad smh...
I love Samsungs but for 2000$ u can buy like 3 or 4 S9s and 4 iPhone XRS who would spend 2k on a Washing machine price for a phone?
This was a waste of time
great Phone I want one
Should have used a 3ds to make this
People might not wanna pay the price because its a samsung device. But if it were an apple product people would sell their kids no questions asked.
Lol

Reported for iPad SAMSUNG phone abuse
How ever many likes this gets is how many times you can fold the phone.
I like the way its not even a samsung that is gettin molested by that hammer
recently i had fallen into a depression and saw no real way out of it and was VERY unhappy with myself and felt no one really cared about me or whether i just kinda disappeared. luckily, when I hit a low point recently I found ‚ÄúWill Smith Grunt‚Äù in my suggested videos, which is possibly the stupidest and most hilarious videos on the internet, and i just started through and watching a few parody videos (you‚Äôre welcome for the ad revenue) and it put a smile on my face and filled me with a happiness I hadn‚Äôt felt in a while and I can‚Äôt thank you enough. You help people John, you cute people. Keep doing what you love. üòé

Noooo!!! You ruined an iPad Mini!
Why would you do this? 2k just absolutely wasted
I just realised it‚Äôs an Apple
I love how he's showing an iPhone rather than a Samsung in the fold "preview"
Nice clickbait but you aren't fooling anybody, that's just a bent iPad you can see the apple logo on the back, you didn't even try did you?
Nice try, but folding an iPad doesn‚Äôt make it iPhone, only Samsung can do it
Waw üòÆ
Well that was the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life..
You are paying for a phone AND a tablet
Omg, what a sleek design, can‚Äôt wait to get one!
Apple trying to copy samsung...

Hey I‚Äôm not sure he realizes this, but that‚Äôs not actually a folding phone.
Clickbait, but it's ok üòè

Shut up and just take all of my money.

Dont know if he was making fun of Apple or Samsung
Have you heard of the child exploitation ring that was discovered in the depths of Youtube?
Advertisers are rapidly pulling out of Youtube, and Youtube is beginning to crack down on videos that could have anything to do with these recent discoveries.
A Youtuber named Chadtronic has been caught in the crossfire.
His videos are family-friendly, funny, and are as far away from these disgusting videos as possible.
But Youtube still assumes the worst.
They've blocked all comments and started to monitor his videos. Just out of the blue. 
Take a look at his videos. Do they look like child pornography? Are they related to child pornography?
No.
But Youtube is punishing him anyway.
I wish there was an easier way to spread the news. But this has to get the job done.
Please support Chadtronic, and let Youtube know that he isn't related to any of this.

very eggsüòäüòä
It‚Äôs so 3D, it looks like the screen is shattered and is coming off. Apple could never.
Look at that high class technology, you can now can decorate it with crystal cracks. 10/10
This must of been one of jacks proudest moments
I feel like I should buy this
Omg so beautiful
when he was folding the tablet it sounded like some asmr mmmm
Yup seems like I don‚Äôt need a screen protector
Waiting for the discount code for the gloves
I love that the add before this was for the galaxy phones
jack use that phone for 24 HOURS
The best phone ever.
Aren‚Äôt laptops just phones you can fold tho?
Did you really get an Apple phone to promote Android

This is a real thing?
So proud of Samsung for reconsidering flip phones. What a novel idea.

Does it come with the Jack folding the phone for you?
Silly goose üòÑ
the new Handy Manny reboot looks great !
john with gloves scares me
Why am I getting the sudden urge to watch the Content Cop on tech destruction channels?
Im disapointed that i would have to buy extra gloves that dont come with the tablet/phone
Now sell it to a eco atm
I thought I was watching markass brownley for a second.
Oh no. We‚Äôve lost him. He‚Äôs gone insane.
I just realized that an iPad lol

Safety first!
Have you tried rice??
Is it out yet? If so, how much?
Whether it's a Samsung phone or iPhone, I still would keep it safe, because you never know what could happen.

Umm I think you broke it, you folded it the wrong way
Thats a tablet,not fold.
cringe
What a waste of space you are man
Why is Samsung using the Apple logo?
What did I just watch
So you got a large phone and beat it to scrap so you could make a joke.
Does it explode?
Weird flex but okay
Techrax is gone


Insert crab rave here

Where is the unboxing video?

hmmm seems good to me
#techrex
This hurts my poor person eyes.
Calm down there texrex
I have this one friend that basically worships Samsung and everything they do, so I already heard about this stupid thing. Thanks for nothing, JasonsVolgs
I don't think it can run even a single app...forget about multitasking. I have to say that Samsung really messed up this year....was not expecting this by Samsung.
I hate this
Why tho
So jack really is Howtobasic huh?
This is so fake. If you look closely, you can tell by the details in the phone that it‚Äôs a cheap knock off.
Ow
a child in africa could‚Äôve eaten that
My friend has a dog the same breed as yours called Bella. Bella is better than your dogs, and so are jenna's dogs.
Ok then...
Now all I need is 2000 bucks

Jack and Brendon Urie would be the biggest forehead collab in history
Wait a second... he called his ears his "peepers"
Brendon has a big forehead.
Jack has a big forehead. 
Brendon plays fortnite. 
Jack plays fortnite. 
It's just meant to be.

You know what you should do on tour? Bring back YIAY Live
Good lord I saw the deepfakes video...impressive, yet highly disturbing and ever so slightly arousing.
Never make a Panic! At The Disco pun again. Thank you
The second mic sounded better
2 videos in 1 day? Lol not the Jacksfilms I subscribed for!
Thought the title said ‚ÄúThey Deep Fried My Wife‚Äù
4:47  finally he tried to eat the mic
I like the echo sound better because it sound like a cave. So there, I chose what I liked and gave a reason.
You should do a live yiay on tour 


Oh wait, it didn‚Äôt work very well when you did it live on twitch. Never mind.
Can you actually make The Thong Song by Kidz Bop
I like the one without the Rode mic i can hear the echo everywhere so i can memorize your house using echolocation
Why did I read it as-
They Deepfucked my wife.
So sorry for Erin.
The first question is literally Jack's channel

Fun fact: I don't like the movie avatar.

Maybe jacks PowerPoint could of changed my mind. Doubt it though.
Jack: So ask me a questions and I will ignore them...
Also Jack: YOUR GRAMMAR SUCKS
Woah... I watched this live
‚ÄùI‚Äôm an OwO in the streets, and an UwU in the sheets.‚Äù
Yeah, makes sense.
You need to see where you‚Äôre going when walking outside.
And you need to close your eyes to go to sleep.
why don't you hide the mic behind a flowerpot or something, like in the movies
It‚Äôs 2019

You know what that means

Shrek 5 is coming
gets married
Jack: mY wIfE
I honestly prefer it with the mic far away, it honestly sounds better no insults meant here.

Thanks for the advice man, feel good to have had my question answered.
Money motivates you to upload? 
But you don't have enough to buy a new pair of pants?
Is that why you barely upload?

Why do people use "I forget" like this? It should be "I forgot". This always bothers.
I counted the first 10 questions and was hoping he would actually do the ad
Jack: I can't really do anything 
Erin: * mad handsprings *
I'm not buying the Twitter for Android shirts yet because I'm waiting for it to finish and THEN buy the shirt so it's the full thing

Just wondering but why do you live?
Without the mike
ROFLCOPTER!!! LOL this video was so awesomesauce!
Karen deepfaked the kids.
I had high hopes of seeing my question answered.








I'll see myself out.
The ¬¥High Hopes¬¥pun was so flawless now I¬¥m legit waiting on that collab.

The video when he said BREDon urie!!!
Ouch our feelings
USSR THEME starts playing
You could do a live version of YIAY, where you ask a question and people answer it. Or you could do JackAsk also and people can ask you questions. You could do a show of just live versions of all your videos.
If Brendon Urie and jack collabed their foreheads would become too powerful.
Genuinely preferred the microphone further away. Can't stand the sound up close
Freebooting has made it too jackask, so proud üò≠

8:10 Wow, thanks for finally answering my question at last, Jack!
What are you doing for JackAsk 100
Love it. This is some nostalgia pure John Douglass
Thanks for the Rode mic experiment. Really cleared everything up. It sounds better off.
just do some european travelling and meet fans on the side. bring merch lul $$$
You could also preform skits and do live jackask. And we live in Hawaii so hello first stop of your tour.
Just because you've never done standup doesn't mean you couldn't.
90's DOOM name drop!
Fortnite with Brendon Urie?

Ads? I haven't seen a single YT ad since 2015

Hey jack, Can you make some type of excel and determine which one of your ‚ÄúTwitter for Android‚Äù tweets gets the most likes? 





It‚Äôll be interesting to see which day(s) people thought the tweet was more like-able than others
Thank you so much for answering all 30 of my submitted questions Jack. They were answered relatively fast, but I appreciate you taking the time to address all of them.
I always knew jack was a special guy but I never would have thought he'd show his friends PowerPoint presentations for fun.
Seeing Jack rant about the wedding dress black market was enough for today
The tweet needs to be a video star wars intro style going back to day 1
Ouch

JACK IS A COMMUNIST
0:38 That actually made me laugh.








Well I guess Jack's jokes are funny at some point.
Is audible going to sponsor your tour?

BUT WAIT THERES MORE!

So he's going to use the damn mic for jackask as well sigh
Bring back 2008 Youtube
For some reason the term "deep fake" sounds incredibly terrible.
Kinda looks like ur holding a mic d up to ur face am I the only one who sees this
Not holding the mic is much better
6:15
You sure?

Hey, yeah! I wanna shoop baby!
I remember at University I was studying history and we had to recreate a late medieval castle and the teacher said we could draw it or make it in Minecraft 


(No one did Minecraft)
Do PowerPoint presentations on tour! I‚Äôve watched the Shrek 3 analysis more times than I care to admit
A full 8:28 of content. Congrats
What are you doing for jackask 100#
hey it was /u/GuusDeKroon not the name you said
You should tour yiay live as a game show
Can someone please deepfake me one too
6:55 The real reason Jack is a weeb is because of all those livestreams he did with Domics for Crunchyroll
He sounds like Lola from Big Mouth at 1:41
‚ÄúShut up Maggie‚Äù THE WAT THAT HE SAID IT KSKSKS
7:32 But Brendon Urie is and you can play piano John üëÄüëÄ
Preform Hamilton as a one man show live for your tour, I would buy tickets.

Wait a minute do the ten minute ads on YouTube have mid rolls ?

I bet jack really knows how to spell audible
Sing All Of The Royalty Free Christmas Songs On Tour
The less we hear you the better it is
I was waiting for Jack to mispronounce deepfake with deepthroat
Either one, I never really notice echo in videos
Is it just me or do these just keep getting better? Wow, John, great moves, keep it up, proud of you!
gota move speed
Airpods or Galaxy buds, and why?
I can see you doing Bo Burnham style shows onstage very successfully.
WOW THERE SURE ARE A LOT OF BRENDON URIE REFERENCES IN THIS VIDEO
as a media student i would actually pay money to see you edit a video
You joke about the ads being longer but i've gotten 15 seconds ads with a 15 second skip buttons...

#YIAYtour

i doubt jack will see this but if you really cared about the MCU you'd be more excited than ever
Hey jack use a Xbox mic. It's affordable... that's it.
Imagine jack using something that isn't sponsoring him

Could you bring fix your flags back?

Can u make a piece of lo-fi music but with really agressive lyrics
#JackAsk Are you subbed to pewdiepie?
I suddenly remembered this, but my friend said you had a weird accent. She thought you were foreign (Swedish), but she couldn't place exactly place it.
Even when every one gets featured, i still don't get featured.
Do you um gloop? DjsmsfjH
>audiobook
>read the book with my own two peepers
Will Smith is a god-tier YouTuber it‚Äôs okay to feel inferior.
"This" definitely sounds better.
You do Live Skits, improve, and JackAsk. Like no real answers. all jackask answers
Brendon has been noticed....finally
Yiaylive live (do that on tour)
I still want to know the precise measurements of your forehead, John. Internally doesn‚Äôt count.
you should get a better hand held mic my guy
I subbed to will smith just to annoy you
Oh yeah yeah is back
How would you react if someone asked you "I don't know how to brush my teeth, what's a toothbrush?"
At least you earned your 4.5 million+ subs. Will Smith just did a couple movies and is now on YouTube lol
oh yes, please do collab with brendon urie
jacksfilms! at the disco
What do I do if I want to see the "Twitter for Android" monstrosity unfold, but I've been suspended on Twitter?
this sounds better
7:04 Jacksfilms is finally doing his part?!
"this" sounded better
Legit once had a 45 min add lmao
I think this sounds better
jack they do ask a question when you exchange your audiobook
The not holding the mic sounded better
I wouldn't mind that jackask went from sarcasm packed episodes to this.
Jack should tour YIAYLive, Live.
He has no idea who Brendon urie is, right? üòÇ
Pewdiepie vs T-Series?

I ONLY care about Jack vs Will
Do you only do JackAsk when Audible sponsors you to?
i like the echo tbh. 
#stopholdingthemic
You could be like dan and Phil and just do random stuff on your tour
Deepfaked Erin looks kinda like Gabbie, ya know, the "what if I'm the monsterRR" lady... ü§îü§îü§î
Any sort of mic setup where I dont have to hear Jack talk as much is a good one in my book
What to do on tour:
2 hour presentation on Avatar
4.00 "HEY WAS THAT A PANIC REFERENCE!"
Wait. Audible has monthly payments AND you pay for each book?
3:58. Well then maybe tonight you‚Äôll be victorious. OwO
Ouch
Our
Feeling
tbh i actually like the sound of jack holding the mic better
i'm pretty sure you didn't go through all questions, i didn't see my question, also what about the twitter questions?
this sounds the best 1:27
Seriously why is Jack talking slower and slower in videos?
Jack, just watch Brendon's streams. He sucks too
8:56 it‚Äôs an audiobook Jack. The whole point is NOT using your eyes
If Jack and Brendon Urie did a collab all we would see is forehead.
I love audible! Lmao
At 2:54 Jacks glass looks to be filled with water. Jack is pregnant confirmed
Make a Prezi next time for your Avatar rant; then we‚Äôll talk
I'm starting a petition to rename Jackask to 7 you asked me
You kinda look a dude
Holding the mic up close if fine, just move it a little further away. It sounds like a podcast when it's that close.
Obviously... PowerPoint tour.
Maggay haha
HE SHOUTED OUT BRENDON OMG
That mic looks like a di**
it's offical that I have a dirty mind
HE PREDICTED THAT SONIC WOULD BE WORSE!
I honestly prefer the mic away from him, lol
do powerpoint presentations on tour
i really hope that nobody deepfaked erin how i assumed they deepfaked erin for the first .2 seconds
These bitch's in my class told me my question was in but I can't find it!!! Ack
im an OwO in the streets
Okay, seriously though, I would love to watch Jack just edit for five hours straight live on tour.
5:40 welp, now there‚Äôs a part 2 coming
Lachlan at 2:40
7:06 i could beat him with onely using 3% of my power.
I'd wish for forknite battle royale
This isn‚Äôt Jacksepticeye?

Jack black will pass you ü•∂

8:53 i lije the meme big boy thing in the backround
Do jackask live on tour.
hell yeah i finally made it into a video

Now I‚Äôm just waiting for Brendon Urie to respond
tip: if you put brendon urie in your thumbnail your video will become more popular than all of your other videos
It's honestly difficult to focus when you're man spreading on me like that jack
don't worry jack brendon sucks at fortnite too
4:01 I deeply appreciate that
4:47 is the proof that he is indeed gay.
8:31 THE FIRST QUESTION üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How do I mansplain to my wife that I need to go to #jackask tour?
Hey Jack, Do u kno ded memes lik da wei
On April 1 do the tweeter form android on an iPhone
Sub2Jacksfilms
All jokes aside jack not holding the microphone sounds objectively better.
I think "this" sounds better
"Or This" is better
A Fortnite dances tour obviously jack, duhh
I edited a porno that became an audiobook, and you don't even need audible to listen to it.
4:17 Jack watches Hello Internet?
Actually if Jack did stand-up, that would be woke
pp
they have a lUDAcris amount of audiobooks that cAnnOt be beat
inb4 Jack gets Grammarly to do the next YGS
i see it
i want it
check the price
cant buy it
OMG OMG HE MENTIONED BRENDON
do YIAY live but everyone answers on their phones like a game of kahoot
On tour you could do an interactive yiay
The second, actually.
1:19  Leave your answers in the comets below.  I'll pick my favorites in the next episode of YIAY.
I thought you would actually read my question and got excited. Now I understand all you bring is pain and disappointment
666k views. Nice.
Jack, ever heard of Audacity
I think Jack has just been drunk for all of (his videos in) 2019. I like üëçüèº
8:39 ThAy HaVe A lUdaCriS
#JackAsk if the distance between my house and the grocery store is x, and my dad took 15 minutes to walk x





why isn‚Äôt he back? It‚Äôs been 2 years
Make an easy YAIY #YIAYtour
I clicked cuz I accidentally read it as " they deepf*cked my wife", sorry jacküòÖ
GO ON A TOUR AND DO LIVE YIAYS
holding the mic sounds crisp.
T W I T T E R  F O R  A N D R O I D
I think "this" sounded better
Brendon Yuri
I see Justin.y everywhere on YouTube
I love brendon urie omggg
If you ever go on tour you should do a live action jack ask
i love jacksfilms but his vids are 20% "THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY"
This video should be called "10 minutes of a white man laughing at his own jokes"
Heh. He was right about Sonic being worse.
4 41
Oof 

Our 
Overlord 
Farquad
 
They have the forehead
OwO is for up front and aggressive moves as well as confronting
UwU is for content but shy meaning your sheepish in bed but just very aggressive out of bed
Wait, they're actually doing Dune again?
This is wonderful i love this
gotta hit that 10 minutes amirite
You should let yours and ksi's forehead have a boxing match
JACK DO YIAY LIVE ON TOUR
0:10 * sees ad at the end of the video *
Y does Megamind have a bigger forehead
I like it better when he hold the mic y'all please don't take this away from me
There's only
1 thing
2 do
5 words
4 you

your forehead is too big
Doubles üòÇ
I liked the second option
Ouch, our feelings
oof - expressing discomfort, as from sudden exertion or a blow to one's body.
what do you say to your lady if she tells you she doesn‚Äôt love you?
write a musical or an orchestral suite or something and then surpass hamilton
How do you edit five hours a day when you upload one video every two weeks?
7:34 
VALENTINES DAY HAS REERED ITS UGLY HEAD
7:05 MUSIC STARTS PLAYING
Lol geddit Jack and Beebo both have big foreheads
Definitely no microphone sounds better
You should just do weird power point presentations on your tour
As soon as I heard "Brendon Urie" I knew what was coming.
I'm getting a Twitter for Android shirt for my birthday on the 26th.... also it sounds better without the microphone
Avatar is just Vietnam War in an alien ecosystem
Get a proper microphone setup
At 3:50 I was laughing so hard XD!
I think you would sound better without the microphone.
Do the Fortnite!!! üëÖü§§
Clear the notifications on your phone please thanks
Low key kinda sick of your ad reads at the end, you could at least try to make them funnier like gus Johnson or drew gooden
4:46 Now you're using it right
You could actually play piano live
If you stare too long into Twitter for Android it stares right back
"Jack, I know you don't have confidence in your own singing ability, but you can set up mics with autotune and your piano skillz are definitely probably epic enough for live performances"- my fiance Kris as we watch your video together
I already get ads longer than the videos
That speed run wasn't all of them, I watched it in 0.25 speed and didn't see mine, liesssss!
I like this better
7:08 did he make a pewdiepie reference or
I swear to god I will never buy Audible or its components even if it's the best thing.. They have freaking ads on every channel I subbed it's so irritating
If you use Safari YouTube on your IPhone there‚Äôs no ads in between videos, only occasionally before.
Not sure whether I hate you or love you for that quicc segue into a sponsorship
Please do it for real
I think ‚Äúthis‚Äù sounds better.
preesentation
1:20 I choose THIS
You did us a bamboozle
The 2nd. All the way.
Communism is Just advanced sharing is caring
Jack not sure you'll read this, but get a lavalier my dude, it's those tiny mics that you just clip on to your shirt
I love the dune book series
Do you think you will ever make it to YIAY #1000?
You sound like an ASMR channel
TBH, Minecraft will be relevant to memers by 2020, and, there's a small chance it will come in 2019
The way your sitting makes me uncomfortable
1:22 that sounds better honestly
still waiting for jackask 100
Thank you for using the word ‚Äúfreeboot‚Äù
#JackAsk if you hypnotize someone to murder someone else is the death on you or the person you hypnotized? ü§îü§îü§î
Of course, a man with Chelsea FC profile would ask the meaning of 'Oof' 4:36
I like the echo, your voice up close is extremely irritating and it makes me uncomfortable smh.
Am I blind or was one of his "friends" Nathan from Drawfee
Big up my man Brady Haran with the freebooting it has become an integral part of the youtube lexicon
The union of the big forehead men ;-;
Seriously, you would be amazing at standup. or sitdown
To be fair, the angry birds movie wasn't that bad
Dune is really good book
A live YIAY with the audience
Jack I know you're an Apple guy but you gotta do something on that new foldable phone from Samsung
@jackask this guy botherin you babe?
Can you please do a better version of Sicko Mode or Mo Bamba?
every wednesday
Yo, is he holding an android?


The boy broke.
1:35
 Did he just say Ariana Grandad or am I crazy?
this sounds better
Loud sonds better
I like that you're planning on reading an audio book with your eyes.
Surely YIAY Live as a tour would work? Do what you do best - Make your audience do the work for you... LIVE!
There was an angry bird movie??
Jack‚Äôs turned into NakeyJakey
@5:32 jokes on you hater, Angry Birds 2 coming to theaters August 16.
You should wear a lavalier mic.
This kinda made me sad
ads on YouTube are not longer, but more frequent. I let an ad play because I was busy, and then a SECOND ad played
I sometimes wonder why I have your twitter notifications on.
7:00 ur welcome
Yiay live LIVE!!!
Wow. Even when Jack answers all questions, he still doesn't answer mine
How could they not make the mic into a dildo though?
Don‚Äôt Rode make those mics you can clip to your collar?
You can't make a better 7rings, it's Arinana Grande, she's already the best!
But of a dodgy title but ok
Every time he says "deepfake" I keep thinking he's gonna say "deepthroat".
I bet you wouldn‚Äôt pin this
Ads should be 10+ minutes so the ad can get money
Stealing the books from pdp
I asked "Why are you gay" to Jack and he answered, "because I'm bored"
This sounds better than This to be honest.
MY FAVORITE PAIR OF BOXERS IS LOGAN AND JAKE PAUL I‚ÄôM-
wow no skip 2 Hour long adds yay.
Wow he actually did 10,000 qs in 10 minutes!
NO CLICKBAIT
Second one is better
Do more of these
The second mic is definitely better jack.
you want some guacamole?
Someone deepfake John's face onto the Aladin genie
2:04 why are my eyes glitched?
Noah Fence, but I'm pretty sure I don't need a code for that 30-day trial, as I got mine a couple days ago just like that... Audible should probably come up with some better perks for sponsorship than "2 free originals - whoohoo!" (the trial also means you can download 1 audiobook for free and that's about it)
I read that deepfucked
Oh Lord
You sound better without the microphone.
guess what guys

I MADE IT IN JACKASK üòéüòé
He kept his promise guys
I feel like oof actually could stand for that
I thought I'd try to A N T S
Hey I think your pants are ripped
I was just about to ask why he holds the mic so close then the video explained it

But in his old YIAYs he doesn‚Äôt hold his mic he just stands closer to the camera
The third one is the best
you could do something like yiay live
This sounds better
DRINK on tour
I'm happy that you're actually sticking to that Twitter challenge
Why do you look 7 years younger in the January video
This sounds better
This sounds better
This sounds better
It sounds much better when you're not holding the mic
This sounds better
This sounds better
Hey.. YGS every friday? Hmmmmüòë
1:18 I prefer this
Last time I was this early Pam and Roy were still together
Erin is still kind of pretty with Jack's face
Just buy an iPhone lol
Or... We could shell out for a studio mic/mic arm?
6:32 You guessed it
Jacksfilms vs Will Smith new fight
*deepthroat you mean
What the heck?






Thats it, thats my comment.
I need a Jacksfilms x Brendon Urie fortnite stream event called "Forthead"
Voice Crack? 8:39
I counted only 33 questions!!
Listen closely at 5:14
Ding Dong Your opinion is Wrong
Hold the mic
I think This>This.






But hey just my opinion.
oh my god get rid of the microphone
Use your old mic then
Oh yeah yeah
the twitter notification i get every morning at 4:00 am signalising your ‚Äútwitter for android‚Äù tweet grounds me. if helps me remember my place in this world. thankyou jacksepticeye.

1:48
Oh hey, I‚Äôm in that video!
I think this sounds better.
We choosed your title
Star Wars IX: War of the Stars
#JackAsk Do you eat walnuts with or without the shell?
Why is La Croix tweeting about wine?
You forgot my question ;(
Did you  ever stop to take time to think about how this is just yiay reversed
You say ‚Äúdeep faked my wife‚Äù as if someone had an affair with her.
Why is yo‚Äô forehead so frickin‚Äô big?
i like to magically absorb my books through my ocular spheres, not my ring shaped tinnitus limbs.
RODE sounds better
#JackAsk Do you remember James/TheOddOnesOut in vidcon? When his hand was bleeding in the elevator with Jaiden animations?
There is actually an angry birds two coming out now
The blue of his shirt and his jeans match so well...he looks like he is wearing a jumpsuit. 
Reminds me of my time in prison
This was by far the funniest jack ask you‚Äôve ever made
REaD with Ur PEEpErs
Or this sounds better
DONT HOLD THE MIC
How do I find the PowerPoint presentation video ?????
I like how I watch the ads but I never buy them
Dune is great.
JSKSKSKS I DIED
Leve your question in the comments below I‚Äôll pick my favourite in the next episode of YIAY
Where can I find this PowerPoint presentation video?
Please share your PowerPoint on Avatar üôè
Fifty days in and it looks like a ladder of tweets
Nothing personal kid
That deepfake looks like D-Trix.
You didn‚Äôt do mine, so you lied
Oh I was in the video
I think this sounds better
I got a question for you. Is that new software editing laptop actually made to make good quality videos? Cause I need an upgrade...
At 3:40 we both have the same profile pic and my heart dropped when I saw it and I got sad when it wasn't me
I think this sounds better
The 2nd this
Steal Bo burnhams thing.
You should do a yiay live tour
You hold the mic like that so we can hear your uvula.
2nd one sounds better
2nd one sounds better
Best ad segment to date
The 2nd one
The second one
This sounds better
What sounds better, this, OOor TthIiSs
3:57 I love you
Bobs or vegana
me me big boy
damn that was a long add
You like
   My hair?
Gee thanks
   I'm Balding.
#JackAsk Where are the two broke college students?
I want you to make an outrageous claim like, "New Jackask in one hour," and then actually do it.
I‚Äôm so happy that my question could be answered internally .
Spoiler the alert






Harry Potter dies in AvengersEndgame
is that mic bigger than your forehead?
Oh god, the Pokemon lol card sealed the cringe.
But i was not featured lier
I like the second audio better
that 90's FPS hallway really got me good
on tour you should just say "twitter for android" for an hour
hey I didnt see mine
What do you think about the new kids bop album
I'm an uwu thank u next
Is it sad that some of our comments were on his community post which he just IGNORED smh
yeah brendon do it
hey search up jacksfilms (and yes i know that is you're name) they called you an internet celebrity
How many comments do you get of people guessing the sponsor?
His laugh is contagious
Jacksfilms doesn‚Äôt have a forehead. He has a ten head
twitter for iphone will be the twitter for android of 2020
now waiting for merch that says "OwO in the streets, UwU in the sheets"
Jack where can I watch that PowerPoint
"What should I do on tour?" This should be a YIAY question.
The second one clearly sounds better
your pants are broken
plz never hold the mic again oml
nice T SHIRT
The microphone is WAY better
My teacher: Do your English work.
Me: I'll do it when i come home. 
Me inside: ha, i'll just use grammarly and YGS that comes evrry friday.
Far away as it is harder to hear you
i dont wanna hear your warm melting voice
On tour floss
I once had a ad that was half an hour long. Imagine trying not to commit not alive if there was no way to skip that
5:44 - Thank you Jack, very cool!
The subs are a no go Jack, a genie can't make people love you...
Twitter for DOOM
"What would I do on tour?" How about bring Back YIAY Live Jack, I want my god damn Klondike store coupon
0:44  Missed opportunity, should've deep throated the mic like Riley Reid did
Love that t-shirt you got there
You‚Äôre truly a meme king, Jack
You could do yiay live live
When he took out his sword I‚Äôm like this isnt we- *separates into two swords*
Nice T-Shirt
Can you read this?
I laughed so hard at 5:14 üòÇü§£üòÇ #itsrewindtime
Yay for once in my life! I‚Äôve finally got featured!
If I were RODE, I would not sponsor him.
Go up on stage and sneeze #yiaytour
You can always do a DDR dance tour with your evil doppleganger.
Just get a different mic
So what's up jack?
Now I see why you hold it
Youtube for Android
Question: Do you like Avatar: The Last Airbender? If so, what are your thoughts?
I try to make it a challenge to skip to the next video whenever I feel a transition to today's sponsor incoming
The PATD fans are screaming
better fix, get a lavalier microphone they clip on your tshirt, theyre snoll and leaves your hands free for... other stuff
Uh, excuse me. You didn't do them all. I didn't see you answer my question. Not even when you sped read them all. Trust me. I slowed it down to x0.25 speed, and watched it frame by frame almost. And I didn't see it...
It sounds better if ur not holding the mic. :P
All of these questions would be better YIAY questions than there were in the past 200 episodes.
Yo me and the first dude have the same profile picture, I thought I was original
#JackAsk Hey Jack, are you doing anything special for #JackAsk100? If you haven't thought of anything yet, may I suggest a full-length film as you did for #YGS100? I really enjoyed that, and I‚Äôd like to see a sequel. It‚Äôs just a thought but I‚Äôm curious to know what other things you may have planned and if any other jacksfilms viewer has any ideas too.
Jack stop pointing at your crotch, it makes me so uncomfortable, and so, unusual aroused.
What does smh stand for?
OwO on the streets 
UwU in the sheets
Not holding the microphone sounds better
4:16 hold up is this ru paul
So does this mean that you answered my question on twitter about if erin escaped the basement?
Where can I buy tickets to jack editing a video tour sponsored by audible?
Ripped jeans? So quirky john
You should do live haikus on tour
The not holding the mic sounded better
, imho.
Mic position doesn't matter, it only sounds better when you stop talking.
9 views, 310 comments, 813 likes. Cool
You would be more worried if Morgz Mum overtook you
yeah mike dumb headset required you know wireless cool points nil
im gonna follow u on twitter so i can witness the twitter for android for myself
i want that merch.
Would like to change my question since it wasn‚Äôt featured. My new question for #JACKASK is...

‚ÄúHow could you?‚Äù
Twitter for android sounds better
This was a really good video!
close your legs john
Both the mic positions sounded like shit. Surely there's a happy middle ground where it's just out of the camera's view.
I'm still waiting for you to deep throat  that mic
GET A LAV MIC
How hyped are you for the Flamin - Hot Cheetos Movies.
when will you do dubstep solves everything 4
"OwO on the streets, uWu in the sheers."
I disliked the video, AD was too short and skipable.
I think THIS sound better than this
There's a pretty big hole in your pants, right on your left knee.
If an ad is 10 minutes or longer, will it have an ad inside of the ad
Why does everyone judge you furries
Jack, change your clothes.
Ooooooooh how I miss you Jack! John! What's your name again?
You‚Äôre the new Andy Dick. It‚Äôs a compliment.




It‚Äôs a compliment
You could do yiay live but it's actually live, Like a bunch of people would line up and ask questions
I like when jack holds his rode mic
Just sit closer to the mic then
I like the 7 hour add I got on other videos,  Is that long enough?
This was one of your funniest videos jhon.
So, is it bad if I think he sounds better without the mic shoved into his face?
We got a mission ma dolphin bois
We need to cut his forehead
At least we all end up happy
Whats with that Jimmy Fallon laugh?
I completely forgot that their was an angry birds film
where can i watch the powerpoint presentation thing?
Ouch HeRe‚ÄôS yOuR oFfEr GaMeRs
#JackAsk why did you stop calling us biches
Oml that panic at the disco joke
1:22 is definitely better. I don't want to hear your sad breaths and aggressive voice cracks.
Twitter for android
In this video, John proves that despite going to college for music theory, he failed to learn a damn thing about audio engineering
I used add block whilst watching this video
...I honestly still think the echoey audio is still better
Is that Daniel Radcliffe?
Oh zootalo
When you have a WHOLE SERIES on grammar, but your username is ‚Äújacksfilms‚Äù instead of ‚Äújack‚Äôsfilms‚Äù or ‚Äújack‚Äôs films‚Äù
You didn‚Äôt use the other two wishes?
I lost a little respect for you when I realised that the hole in your jeans wasn't intentional. SMH
Who was that missed call Jack?
2:54 JACK ARE YOU PREGNANT?!?!?
Jackass #91 :) ?
Jack where's the next jackask it's 1hr already üò§
Hi Jack, can you tell me if there`s a way to get a book (let's say lotr or got) in your head but not actually reading it?
shameful display
Do you love my pfp
I don‚Äôt like you T-Series 7:04 But I must 7:08
I don't know what to comment
Jack you already answered half of the questions. Those questions were "can you even answer 1k+ comments?"
You got a sexy laugh
heeey, it's been a year since you won that youtuber award! time flies when you're making powerpoint presentations
Who's here from the twitch stream üôå
Flipy boi for life
What is a prisentation jack?
Why is Audiobook keep on sponsoring you? Don't they get tired of you?
oh zuutoolol?
When are you gonna get a real job
I made it into the speed answer part 


Yes I slowed it down to see if I was in it 




Yes I‚Äôm happy 






Shut up
I thought the title was they deefried my wife
Pay to watch you edit live? I'd prefer how you currently do it. On twitch.tv/jacksfilms
watching ads all the way will give the creator more money.
Do cover videos
Reading Dune? Praise the Maker! Hope you enjoy, big boy
do you think we need a better CEO with a bigger brain with the capacity of your forehead for Youtube?
How do you spell Audible?
Mature please
The second one
You should do Stand Up on tour. At the end of the part where you listed all the things you can't do on tour, I was dying of laughter!
The second one
I can‚Äôt stand the mic. I haven‚Äôt watched any of your videos all the way through since you‚Äôve started using it like this.
Doing PowerPoint presentations at a party is the whitest thing I've ever heard.
What would you do if you were told some of your subscribers were furries?
I see Erin, and I cli....oh, Jesus!
The mic against your mouth sounds better
she looks more like gabbie hanna lmao
Maybe do a jackask or yiay on tour?
DId pay for a solid hour and a half of you saying MeMe Big Boy
OH YEAH YEAH
Twitter for Android world tour
Jake holds pp to his mouth
You should really stop holding the mic. The latter clearly sounds better than the distortion that is holding the mic up to your face.
Twitter for android?
That third into question spooked me because I wasnt looking at the screen and then he said "shut up maggie," whic happens to be my name
Jack, the old mic sounds better and is less distracting, stahpit
Please keep holding the mic sir
Sound quality of the mic propped up out of frames is absolutely worth how ridiculous you look trying to deepthroat it all the time
I thought they meant avatar the band, not the movie lmao

Microphone on camera>>>. plus u don‚Äôt look stupid <3
Or just clip on a mic that's ten times smaller to your shirt.
Tour should just be you asking a yiay questions and people answer them
We were all featured on Jackask! WE DID IT REDDIT!!!
I feel proud for voting for this on Twitter
They deepfucked my wife.
I'm convinced that the mic choice was supposed to be a temporary thing till he got a new one but we were all so annoyed by it that Jack's now using it to spite us.
Where the hell do i get a Twitter for android shirt?
I have high hopes you never make that joke again
4:37 thank you for keeping the oof ours, comrade.
0:31 I hate this
The Ariana Grande joke made me LOL. Great video today
Brendon Urie  has a bigger forehead than you. That‚Äôs impressive.
This sound better
#JackAsk Will you stop JackAsk right when you hit #99?
I didn't see my question at all. So that was a lie
They‚Äôre making a 2nd angry birds jack
They deepfucked my wife.
You call you ears peepers?
brendon urie
Let the mic on the floor, it may not sound good, but it feels good.
Theres 1hour adds
Both, I‚Äôm deaf
I think this sounds better.
Roses are red 
The like button is blue
I didn‚Äôt get it JACKASK and you didn‚Äôt to
I think this sounds better.
I liked #2 better
why the shotgun mic man? go back to the lav!
1:21 the second one sounds better because it has your voice, but quieter
Go on tour where at every location you let the masses sing all of your best songs with you!
As a Dane i hate how you pronounce "R√∏de"
Not having to get a job. 4:41




Timber.
Kind of upset with the Shrek answer
Don't hold the mic so close
4:34 I was under the impression there already was
LOL you don't have to say condescending and patronizing at the same time, just pick one.
Oh Yeah Yeah!
I hate that new microphone. I actually was the videos less because of it. It hits my ears in a weird way
Hey John, if you want to get better at fortnite how about you stop streaming. One reason why you keep dying is because of stream snipers, they're every streamers worst nightmare when it comes to fortnite. 

Edit: unsubscribe to Will Smith.
I like the seccond one better
I hate how real that faceswap looks
oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah?
The world isn't ready for the amount of forehead that the combined powers of Brendon and Jack would create.
I came for Erin.
I absolutely hate the sound of you holding the mic, it makes me want to stop watching your videos.
i hate when im watching one youtube channels videos, and an unskippable ad from another channel with similar genres appears every single video.
Can you play Moe! Ninja Girls
do you know waht yold sond good if you ATE the mic
The sound is better when youre not holding the mic üò¨
Gotta be honest, I thought deepfaking meant something else. Like "Sike, I'm not gonna go deep" and then pulling out.
I finally got in his video
Jack asks, can you sing mo bamba
who is brendon urie
I'd pay to see John do standup
The second one is better
hey Jack
Jack listen
hey 
hey Jack
hey
Jack

bazinga
Cool cool but i still don't know if Shrek is better or gene
If you like original Dune book you'll like House Harkonnen. It explains a lot of things. Like how the Baron Harkonnen became so nasty looking.
Can you tour with your power point presentations. I'd honestly pay to see one of those. You have a unique sense of humor that makes just about anything you do entertaining.
Do you call your ears your "peepers" or can you read sound with your eyes because either way, I'm impressed.
When is YGS 200
3:19 Is that Nathan from Drawfee?
Dammit, it does sound better held. Closer to his forehead so less echo or whatever.
Ngl I actually shed a tear laughing at the Little Mermaid joke
i wanna have a powerpoint party >:-(
please never stop holding the mic
1:25 you do sound better
Why are you doing this to us?
serious awnser: the one at 1:30
You should totally go on tour doing all the things you said you couldn't do in the video
7:03 lyric's from the t series diss
Who do you main in smash
7:03 ~ 7:11 proof that YIAY copied LWAIY
I think this is better
I like the asmr mic
Please keep holding the mic
Wait... Netflix is cancelling Jessica Jones and the Punisher?
The second one boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I like this better
There's a hole in your jeans
Honestly the mic is horrible, John.
I‚Äôm more of a Uwo kinda guy
How many used code jackasks in audible?
Woooowwww man... A tour to see you edit. Best idea ever. I would love to see that happen. Wouldn't go, but I bet I'd chuckle if you did a video about it.
I finally made it on jackask wow 8:11 to 8:16
It says 9 views and 192 comments...
Cant tell of the mic bc ur voice is equaly awful
Your stomach is short
The sad Part is the second is better
Anyone else think that the guy in the pic 2:42 looks like Lachlan
you look like jack from supernatural how am i just know realizing that
Shut up Maggie.
They made my wife Shane Dawson famous
Hey, you skipped me. But I still like you
Oh yeah yeah
When is the next Alexander Hamilton coming Jack?
"having an audience that deepf***s my wife" - jack Douglass, 2019
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh no I thought it said deepthroated
Oh yeah yeah
What do now?
Remember how The Lego Movie 2 had the entirety of The Lego Movie as one of its YouTube ads? I think that should be the standard length.
Everytime Jack talks about the comments below... I always look at his crotch. So there's that!
Use a lavalier mic jack smh 
No wonder you use android
It would be difficult but you could potentially do something like a YIAY Live where you get people out of the audience to participate. Half baked idea but im sure someone could form it into something workable.
Or this
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why Grammarly won‚Äôt sponsor me.... this episode is sponsored by AuDiBlE
i use storytel because they have books in swedish






nothin' personal, kid
Not holding the mic sounds better
I like the camera mic more
Why do you say ‚Äòpatronising‚Äô badly
Damn mine wasn‚Äôt even shown on here
Oh yeah yeah
normal ppl: Ariana Grande     
And then there‚Äôs Jack...:ARIANA GRANDDAD
I prefer when you don‚Äôt speak at all
I thought the tour was just going to be one big plug for sponsors. You mean there will be actual content?!
Scooby Got Waves
I actually like the mic away from jack more
The 2
Demonitised
Welp he got the name wrong for the new Star Wars. I‚Äôm actually surprised cause I was really hoping he was right
Did anyone else notice he had a missed call.
I have a nook. Am I a sinner?
On the ground mic
why does his upper body look so short
Also just so you know OwO is the sexual one
Will smurf.
Catch me at 2:43
If I did not know what deep faked means the phrase "someone deep faked my wife" gets me thrinkon
7:15 got some bad news for you
why was I waiting for my question to be answered jack?
tfw jack realizes he has no actual talent beside abusing memes as a substitute for comedy
I think you sound better when you don‚Äôt talk at all
I wish jacks would wear more tank tops
Jack should make a version of that Deepfake video where he dubs his voice over JackfaceErin. If she's got his face, she may as well have his voice too.
Don't think it's cute to hint at new merch and not talk about it and you're probably gonna do that for two more videos
0:13 ~'it's gonna be a 8 minute long add' is what he forgot to add.
Why is there a rip in your pants, John?
Can you just put a mic on your shirt? Please?
Boy howdy
Incredible little mermaid reference
Whats Happening in YIAY 500
Jack close your damn legs, be a polite lady. god üòí
The Twitter for Android tweets are the only reason I open Twitter
Oh yeah yeah
Okay Detective Pikachu might actually be really good. I'm excited for it and I'm not really that big of a Pokemon fan anymore.
AskDeepfake: Can you face swap Erin's face on Jack? :D
Which dog do you like better?
It sounds better with you holding the mic, but it looks so much better with the mic out of the shot.

Are those giant carrot peelers?
Jack forehead big XD
Go to Vegas, we want you here
Shut up maggie
I read deepfaked as something else. Lets just say that I was disappointed when I learned the truth.
Why are your jeans ripped
Not the fortnite... the forEHEAD...
It's called a mic stand lol
5:54  It looks like the text is moving
Jokes on you they're releasing another angry birds movie
Jack why are you so hot
Deep fake me daddy
4:09
Ariana Grandad üòÇ
i didnt watch his videos for 4 month, yet  he still does the audible ad
Today's video is sponsored by R√∏de
#Jackask What do you think of the trailer for Spider-Man: Far From Home?
keep the mic not up to your face like you're eating it
I admit I liked the old format better when the mic was off camera, it's sounded weird to have it so close like this after years of it being farther away. Or could get one of those clip-on mics that you wouldn't have to hold if the audio is an issue. That's just my feeling on it anyway.
so when you gonna host Lwaiy?
I heard about deepfakes from Shane
I‚Äôm excited to see my two favorite foreheads play fortnite
Get a lavalier mic you philistine
6:13 mine died after civil war.
I couldn‚Äôt get my eyes off Jacks moose knuckle...
Jack. As a fan and a production sound person..... it hurts to see you with that rode. There are so many inexpensive options you can explore for improved audio. If you REALLY want to spend the bare minimum cash and effort, you could even get a lav that plugs into your phone. If you prefer holding a mic in your hand like this, there are many dynamic microphones like a shure sm57 that you could get. If you really want to up your game, I suggest getting a little mixer/recorder like a zoom h4n pro or mix pre 3 and look for mics with an xlr input (including the sm57)
The great American debate pt2
I prefer when you had the microphone on the floor it sounded better and not as potato quality as it currently it hurts my ears your voice that close to the microphone is like nails down chalkboard
First
Is anyone going to complain that Jack called Ariana Grande ‚ÄúAriana Grandad‚Äù?
He didn't answer my questionnn??
5 hour lego movie 2 ad is real
I think this
hey remember when yiay was daily? when jackask was weekly? when pms was weekly? when ygs existed?



yeah me neither
So jack what are you gonna do for jack ask 100?
#AskJack
Can i deepfaked my own comment?
That deep fake is to good
Didnt he go on tour with one dude a couple years ago? They had like fake beef and were pretending to be debating politicians. I forget. It was pretty funny though. Wish I would've been able to go to one of the showings
You really seemed like your old self in this vid, John, i don't know if your acting has just gotten better but you seemed to be genuinely enjoying yourself. It was nice üëå
HRRRRNNNNNHHHHHHHHGGG
what's the bigger battle?
pewdiepie and t-series
jacksfilms and will smith
Didn't you say you were excited for Will Smith to surpass you in subscribers?
this*****
1:47 Wow, looks like someone didn't watch their cough video
2nd
"How are you gonna read 2.3k questions?"
"Uh, Gotta go fast"

Wow, I just quoted a line in this video. That means I'm lazy But if I really were lazy this comment wouldn't exist
I like when its off
7:10 it‚Äôs all...
#jackask how do you feel that the 50th episode of jackask was over 3 years ago
You should just read youtube comments and make jokes about them live
What do you think of the Pewdiepie vs t series
That Shrek acronym caught me so off guard I shot snot out of both nostrils... So thanks for that
my mum listening: is that sheldon from big bang??
On a tour you look at sites duhh!
Bumbum is a funny word
why is your shirt the same colour as your pants you look like the forgotten member of the blue man group
There isn't an episode nine yet? I stopped paying attention.
8:40
R√∏d in Danish means red, and r√∏de is it in plural. Yet the text it's written in, is in blue.
I think you mean deepfoke
When are you going to do your part?
Here's an idea. Put the mic IN your mouth I bet it'll sound better
Jesus it looks like I‚Äôm going down a scary hallway of jacksfilms‚Äôs tweets. 2:23

I just cane my pants
This at 1:23 time stamp
angry birds 2....
Who else read deepfake as deepfuck?
I once got a 93 hour add. True story.
New YouTube race, Jacksfilms vs Will Smith
The "holding a video that's not supposed to be held, or attaching it to yourself in an amusing DIY manner" is a weird trend. Gus Johnson, iDubbz, you...
wait... Minecraft movie??
Not holding the mic
I don‚Äôt care that Will Smith surpasses you in subscriber count. I still love you Jack.
This is soo sad that is what it is going to be like when t series overtakes Pewdiepie
The sonic movie is filming in my town. They shut down a bunch of highways for it.
Are those the same swords from hipster Jesus?
you looked like you were taking a really hard shit when you were going through all those comments
#jacksask Do you feel good about that you shown the hole in your trousers to thousands of people
Why have a wife when you have the internet
Put it down
1:35 ariana grandad
#jackasklive coming to a city near you
I came here because your wife is more funnier to be honest.
#JackAsk Do you believe in God? (Filthy Frank)
Reeeee
I'd rather have no mic , it looks better (you don't have a giant mic to your mouth ) but still sounds ok
deepfake erin looks like cars delevigne
I think that jack could actually do a bo burnham type tour. Performing his MUsic and then Doing some stand up
Jack I"m not following you on Twitter until you stop this
Its so weird that people use √∏ instead of o because √∏ is a letter in my country
Wow he actually half did it
Id rather have the mic away from your mouth because im not watching an asmr video
#jackask death is imminent
Imagine someone deepfaking Jack's forehead.
why did you show the deepfake maker‚Äôs name as Rauf_C137 when the post you link is made by GuusDeKroon?
This
This one time I had a WHOLE movie as an ad I wish I could remember which movie it was I watched like 20 min of it and was like shit what was i originally watching
nice chef louis
ME ME BIG CHUNGUS
üòè
8:10 If anyone can pause on there comment please screen shot it.
I actually like the echo-y sound better.  It sounds a little more natural, and less like I'm being choked by your stubble.
I think this sounds better
How do we know you're not deepfaked?
I love that bigh lasagna joke 7:00
WTF 8:11
Thither
When will Erin get a Youtube Channel? I'm so tired of being subed to you for your funny girlfriend, who only appears in every 10'th yiay video.
But who needs wives when you have anime girls lmao /s
Hey I'm new here and I just want to  ask: What do you eat first: The white or the orange part of the cigarette?

HE MENTIONED BRENDON my forehead daddy‚Äôs
1:42 sounds like Big Mouth
3:40 Brandon Urie... oh that reminds me in one of these songs Ballad of Mona Lisa there was a pilot in it where he look like jacksfilms
7:30 that tour question should be a YIAY
4:34 even Jack wouldn‚Äôt marry Jack without getting payed
Yiay live.. Live.. On stage
is that Danielle Radcliffe
Hey Jack what do you think about the new and upcoming byte app basically the new vine.
The foreheads would be too much dude
I like the echo
They need to deepfake Klondike's face onto your face.
What if Jacksfilms featured 87 comments at once?
Press this if you're over 8

üëá
Anybody else find it weird he holds his camera mic yet has 4 million subs?...






Btw I am on the road to 7k!! Any help would be great!
This
I know nobody will read this hut for the 1 % that does, I hope you have a great day and great life. I know fame doesn‚Äôt occur overnight but I am trying my hardest to become successful. Wish me good luck !!!
this
He made it to ten minutes....üò¢üôåso proud
You should do a fan mail
This sounds better
Thanks Jack, I will no longer be able to sleep.
Wouldn't one of those clip on mics work for you? You need both hands free for full sass!
I'll buy the shirt at the end of the year when it's at it's maximum ridiculousness
definitely stop holding the mic
Is it me or does deepfake Erin look like Marlene McFly from BttF2?
That deepfake video made Erin look like she could be your twin sister.... oh my
Wish jack could host jkfilms. That would be hilarious.
Don't look at the video I now have nightmares and can't go to sleep.

I sense a disturbance in the force.
At 8:14 Robert asked




So if a furry could dance in your forehead would you allow it
Jack,what's better shrek or the emoji movie
episode 9 is Balance of the Force
they are called lapel mics john, buy yourself one or two
Yay I was featured
Jack has really never heard of a boom mic, huh?
Mature,please
You're totally fun!  Shout out to Jussie. Just something to think of while in jail for foolish games.
#BoycottErpicGames #BoycottFortnite That is all

What does deepfake mean?
why
Why do I find it annoying that he's holding a microphone
Can you please make a 12 hour video where you answer every question for a jack ask
Hey jack, have you ever gotten ad of the LEGO movie 2, then after that, the whole LEGO movie?
I‚Äôm really liking his content nowadays. There was a point where he was uploading daily where I had no interest, but I feel like his content has really improved.
I think thINk sounds best
YOU'RE FINALLY READING DUNE.

DUNE = TIMELESS
8:39 is as good as wine!
JOhn please the microphone thing is creepy, it's like asmr for people who hate to feel good
this sounded better
lmao i got a samsung ad on this vid
#JackAsk ANTS?
The Second One
Technically they deep faked you onto your wife. Sounds better. Probably
The new fold has such a big screen that we can see the first tweet
Twitter on android
Did you just reference the murderous chef from The Little Mermaid?
3:17 I miss Steve Greene videos so much :(
Not holding the mic is fine
1:23 This one
Tour suggestion. You stand on stage doing nothing. Just staring into the crowd while guy fieris face is slowly deforming into yours. Easy money
#jackask I'm starting to wonder how hard it is to NOT get picked when you post an ironic jackask comment being as desperate as I am.

Souch....
Oops!

one time my brother got the entire Lego movie as an ad
I just subscribed to r/forgivememaster yesterday. Huh. Weird coincidence
This
Jack afterward you should do a Star Wars opening video but it‚Äôs just going through first to last of the tweets like the scrolling text but it‚Äôs zooming out if that makes sense
New t series vs pewdiepie: jacksfilms vs will smith
No mic
this thoise
Oh yeah yeah
Everyone:
Jack: What am I listening to?
Everyone: No-
Jack: Thank you for asking
You should do an entire JackAsk where you answer every question internally
Wait... this isn't yiay
Jack "ask". That's totally what I hear when you say that.
Jacksfilms is a one man soulless corporate enterprise.
Buy audible and listen to it with your own two peepers
My name jeff
Is it bad that I really want to see Brendon and Jack collab
Thanks jack,
The second version of the mic was better
ants?
#jackask I need a fursona
i hate this man
hey jack, maybe will smith wouldnt have more subscribers than you if you actually uploaded (or your content formats weren't 3 years old) sry for the hot take buddy
I prefer the mic being farther away cause woth it up close to his mouth its bearing asmr territory and sounds creepy
That little mermaid reference
oh no, search "yass" and see what comes up, I WANT TO DIE
#jackask what's your favourite Eurovision song this year?
Ouch Our Feelings
I see that little mermaid reference.
If you do a collaboration with Brendon Urie I will watch it everyday
Ygs but for the audience‚Äôs social media
That nightmare fuel helps at 11pm
Dune is a really good book.

Brendan Urie and Jack should compete for who has the biggest forehead

#jackask When are you gonna change your channel avatar?
Wishes from Will Smith
1.fortnite

3. Nothing else
Interesting thing about Star Wars Ep8 is that while the casino planet feels like half the movie, it's actually only less than 15 minutes long! That's how bad it was.
im so proud he kept the twitter thing going.





 its abt the only consistent thing he has going on
Holding the mic sounds better
Nope. I looked at the video by each frame. You didnt feature me. I spent a bit time breaking down the speeded version


Also you sound funny in slow motion
A live tour where you just watch Jack edit videos... why does that sound like something he would do?
what does ouch our feelings mean
CLOSE MIC
Your a session
u didtn even answer all the questions?
I think it might be bad I knew what he meant by deepfake
Look at Boyd crowder from justified and then look at jack
Jack looks like his mom....
Why do you have those swords? I never would‚Äôve pegged you as a sword guy. You should wear a trilby to make it more obvious for the rest of us. You know, just so we know what we‚Äôre getting into.
We should do jacksfilms vs will Smith now that pewdiepie vs t series is over
Why I read it like "deepfucked"?
Have you subscribed to PewDiePie?
#jackask What are you listening to?
Ever realised how ads directed at 18+ audiences on youtube barely get seen due to the fact videos directed at the same audiences are demonitized?
You‚Äôre funny
Jackask
#jackask I‚Äôm asking what‚Äôs your fursona beacuse I will draw it and make a fursuit out of it
#JackAsk Bowl or pan?
JackEditsFilms Tour 2020 10/10 Will be a show
"I should read it first, with my own two peepers." ...proceeds to listen to it, no peepers necessary
Thanks for answering my question, Jack
Jack what if you did yiay live, but like actually live
No mic sounds a lot better
The far away mic sounds better.
Well thanks for the answer I guess. ‚ÄúUghhhhhhhhhhhhh‚Äù <- 10/10 answer ign
The second one definitely sounds better
Don't listen to dune actually read it.
Don't just be a lazy shill. 
You are going to look great bald nothing but a forehead then.
Your voice is properly balanced when the mic is far away. I prefer the voice to have proper balance even with the echo. Get a proper lapel mic man.
Somehow Russ just took an L..
Gee holding the mic like that makes me rlly uncomfortable
STOP WITH THE MIC THING I PERFER FAR AWAY
KNNNEEEE

Did anyone else pause a bunch of times to see if their question got answered internally?... mine didn't
You could do a live yiay on stage with random fans would see
This video was actually one of my favorite Jackfilms videos in a while. I genuinely can't remember I when I had laughed that hard at a Jackfilms video. I really appreciate this reboot for quality over quantity.
His foreheads so big it should be called a fivehead.
Y‚Äôall will make awesome kids together.
Both mic setups are awful. Go back to what you were doing before. Unsubscribbled.
omegalul
he already has the new samsung phone, wtf?
They deepfaked your wife. Too bad they couldn‚Äôt deepfake you a life.
Hey jack.... can you help meh with my life issues?? #jackasks
Wouldn't the live tour just be YIAY Live, the Game Show?
This sounds better.
This sounds better
will you play fortnite with me
"doubles"
OWO in the streets and UWU in the sheets is my new catchphrase fight me
Thank you so much for mentioning the PowerPoint idea, 6 of my friends and I are all going in and taking 2 months to prepare.
You should do YIAY live with your audience where they can watch you in person as they answer if you ever go on tour
YIAY Live the Tour
Still not on jackasks, I checked
Also, if you want to go on your, you could just ask YIAY questions and answer other ones and such
fix your microphone please.
why do you look like jimmy falon
He‚Äôs doing more jackask because they‚Äôre easy to make and he can monetize them more
6:03 they will all undie except for the ones who are too old and can‚Äôt pay anymore like rdj
#jackask What do you think of the trailer for Spider-Man: Far From Home?
Why is your channel called jacksfilms if you don't make films?....
You didn‚Äôt answer ‚Äúhow many dogs fit in a watermelon‚Äù
Y‚Äôknow I don‚Äôt usually get likes and I‚Äôm going through a tough time and a like would really mean a lot to me. If you could be kind enough to like this comment I will be very happy.
I hate your new microphone; please go back to the old one.
Im a Sinner and apart of the fam squad, so when the person put Brendon Urie I was QUAKING
I know people are gonna shit on you for making the vid 10 minutes, but honestly I need more long form Jack content.
Ya longer ads I already got a 5 hour one let's go 10
Jack. Love u. But do u have to sit like that?
I like the way you hold the mic
If fantano can go on tour so can you
Can jack not afford a lav mic?
7:08 "bob's or vegana....."
this is the bluest video
OI, oi, oi, Minecraft is still incredibly relevant with more active monthly players than Fortnite.

He who controls the Klondike controls the universe
your face looks so different without such a giant forehead above it
Oh yeah yeah
My comment wasn‚Äôt answered
Jacksflims vs Will Smith is the new Pewdiepie vs T-Series
I have the same problem with both Audible and Steam. I see a sale, I buy more than I have money for and then stress about never having the time to get through it all.

I've never used Tinder, but a lot of these are really sad (and wack), especially the guy who didn't include his picture (not even one relating to him), I mean if you're ugly you're ugly, but no one's gonna swipe if they see a picture which isn't of you.

Also saying your not good looking or something like that, basically begging for compliments/reaffirmation is ass.
