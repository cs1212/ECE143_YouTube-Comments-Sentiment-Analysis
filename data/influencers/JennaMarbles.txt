Mykie from glam and gore is quaking 😂💕
“Julien got food poisoning at one point.”
“It was sick.”
Welcome home Queen.

@glamandgore takes a break from YouTube, and Jenna Marbles fills the gap! 🤣🙌🏼

You and Julian should tie dye something. Beach towels, shirts, shoes? Maybe everything?
The beauty community in hot water.

Jenna: I want a new face. 💁

When writers try to give the grinch a "female" love interest.
You look like you would be the cat in the hat's girlfriend
We can never EXPECT anything from Jenna. She just does the most random things and we love it
This look reminds me of “the sexy vegan” from dr Phil. 7:30
Wow that gave me flashbacks of the nightmares I had about The Cat in the Hat when I was a kid
Queen Jenna arrived back just in time to save YouTube from completely burning down
Can someone PLEASE make an edit of Peach and Bunny doing "that horse thing" I beg of you

P.S. thank you for your videos! After a crappy day and feeling depressed this video was what I needed to make me laugh. Love you guys 💕
Jenna: uploads this video

Horror editors have entered the chat
Alexa, play "New Face" by PSY

If the Grinch had a wife, this is what she would look like lol

You left for one week and everything went to hell.

You are the glue holding this community together.

Oh god.
SHE LOOK LIKE JEFFREY STARS FINAL FORM 💖🙌💃
😂😂😂 aaahhhh Jenna I love you. You’re hilarious
I'm a simple SFX MUA: I see Jenna, I see prosthetics: I click.
Bunny is fully embracing her new life 😂
I would absolutely piss my pants if Jenna ran towards me like she did in the garden scene
Lmao I can't ...... You like you were one of the girls in white chicks who ran through a burning building!
Why does she look like one of the guys from white chicks 😂😂
Why is RabWitch NOT a meme?!?!?!
for some reason she looks like freddy krueger to me but okay-
someone PLEASE make this a horror movie trailer 😂
7:00 her face being all pink looks like a chewed up bubblegum
Imagine being their neighbor and watching that thing Jenna turned herself into just running around the house 😭
Freeze at 8:09 and you'll be looking at Jeffrey Star
This whole video had me on the floor 😂😂😂
First thing to make me laugh out loud in awhile.
She is hilarious 👏👏
YouTube: drama, cancelled, tea

Jenna marbles: I’m a rabwitch
Why does Jenna kinda look like off brand Jeffree Star with the wig on? 😂😭
RabWitch is smelling bs, I'm smelling some new horror edits

Jenna: Uses barbaric prosthetics to create new face

Omg so many likes guys, thank you :3
You should make yourself an 80s horror film character.
Okay, why do I actually like it? It looks.....good?
How do I delete a clip while I'm filming it 😂😂😂
All hell breaks loose in beauty community
Jenna, carrying a fire extinguisher: I LEFT FOR ONE WEEK.
iconic
Ok you seemed to be struggling when putting the pink paint thing on XD So maybe use a paint brush incase you do this again. UwU Looks kewl tho
This reminded me of the pink panther. Anyone else?
This is the funniest thing I ever watched
I'm so glad I was finally able to get "how to trick people into thinking you are really good looking 2"
*the Russo brothers want to know your location*
lowkey it kind of looks like a pink version of the grinch
who tf disliked this and why elaborate 😂😂😂😂😂😂
My therapist: The wear-rab-witch isn't real it can't hurt you
The wear-rab-witch:
That would actually be pretty good special effects for a movie about a burn victim.
rabwitch aka bootleg "the mask"
Do a collab with Mykie! 😆
]LOL would have been nice if she used her foundation, added lashed and contouring. So make it look like a human. More of this, please.
Sees the thumbnail
Me: ...Aww shit, here we go again
I need all the gifs of jenna running towards the camera lol
I think this is the first time I have been legitimately frightened by a Jenna marbles video
She ended up looking like a drag queen gargoyle 😂😂😂
I can just see the horror films being made
I think Jenna’s just tryna get the most horror edits at this point lmao 😂
You’re so damn funny! I’ve been watching your channel for years. Don’t ever stop.💜
Imagine if someone robbed a bank like this 😂
Live action Sonic never looked so good
You look like a pharaoh with that chin 😂😂😂
Oh PLEASE give Julien a new face, he is such a good friend he deserves it.
Why does she look like Jeffree Star for some odd reason.
Is it just me or does she look like a who from The Grinch?
Petition for Jenna to do a collab with glam and gore once she's back from her break
The new season of Grim is looking weird
This is what i imagine The Grinch's love interest would look like
Thanos: “Sorry it’s bring my weird cousin to work day”
Oh my good goo... you are hysterical!
Господи, у неё женский голос😲🤪😂
do a video recreating one of glam&gore’s looks!
If the Grinch was a drag queen, 

This would be it


Edit: hey 369 likes, nice-
Edit 2: 666 likes, nice-
Why does she look like a knock off live action cat in the hat though.... 😂
damn the grinch rlly snapped
😂😂😂 had me ugly laughing! Love you jenna😊
Jeffree had some work done since I saw him last
The one and only beautuber left for one week and the rest of the beauty community just spontaneously combusted
The grinches long lost love, or sister you decide 😂
These horror movie clips are going to fire on J&J memes
Please carve Kermit out of Irish spring
9:27 - 9:31 is what you see when you have sleep paralysis
Imagine going out on your balcony, looking over your neighbor’s backyards and you see this
Ok. This look is freaking me out
from the thumbnail i thought she was doin a face mask and was gonna just talk about vaca and chill- i was so wrong
When Jenna first came out with everything on she looked like the grinch  😂😂
Why does post prosthetic Jenna look like Emma chamberlain
This looks like if Jim Carrey’s Grinch became a drag queen
Okay why does this remind me of Jared Leto
Who else thought of thanos while watching this?😂
damn this is EXACTLY how they'd gender-type the Grinch's gf in the animation movie. upsetting
I though she was going to transform herself into Thanos, but this is much better!!
Lmao 
 YouTube: burns in the background
Jenna with a fire extinguisher: "I LEFT FOR ONE WEEK!"
Do you enjoy providing material for the Jenna horror edit community?
Glam and Gore is QuAkInG
JULIENS BEAUTY SHOTS ARE INCREDIBLE
Don't get me wrong, you look fabulous and the eyebrows are... interesting, but the end look kind of reminded me of Shawn Wayans in White Chicks.  Also, are the foam pieces reusable?  Can you mix and match with the alien cheeks and rabbit nose?
Therapist: rabbwitch isn't real, it can't hurt you.


 rabbwitch:
Why she look like the live action cat in the hat? Just me?
Why does she look like Jeffree and the cat from cat in the hat had a kid
she looks like the Grinch's ex-wife who is still obsessed with him
I was watching Family Guy the other day and no kidding Stewie mentioned you by name in the show!
Rab witch looks like Caitlyn Jenner.
i've been in a dark place for quite awhile, i know its cheesy but i wanna say thank you, for uploading entertaining videos. without drama, etc. i feel better, just watching your videos over and over. thank you, so much. (p.s :  visit jakarta or bali, indonesia. i'd love to meet you in person)

Can't wait for the horror movie edits of this
She looks like if Voldemort & someone from Whoville had a kid.
jenna leaves for one week
Beauty Community: Doesn't know how tf to act
oh my god im terrified im calling the police
That is the scariest face I have seen in a very long time.Rodents are a huge fear of mine and no amount of glam makeup can fix that.I might have nightmares for the next 10 years.
The female version of the grinch 😂
I wish I could watch this for the first time again
beauty community: falling apart 
Jenna: I WANT A NEW FACE

You should try making clothing out of fabric with your dogs faces on it.
I really can’t stop laughing

Sensitive to blood too and hate almond butter for the same reason you do. Tastes like blood! Nobody else has said this but Jenna. Anyone else?
I'm going to go KERMIT suicide.
This is the pink version of the grinch 😂
You look like the Cat in the Hat if he did crack
How to trick people into thinking you’re good looking part two

I need help Jenna can you please do me a favour my fiance and the love of my life left me Monday morning while I was still asleep she left her ring, her picture of me, her house keys to our home, her clothes, and a note saying she was leaving and never coming back. Our relationship was going great honestly I don't know why she'd do this to me or our home. I want her back but, can't get a hold of her. I'm trying to get her favourite YouTubers too all rally around and help me get the love of my life to come back home😔
looks like a pink version of the live action grinch
Girl you picked the BEST week to be gone. YouTube has been nothing but drama👏🏽
cant wait for these horror edits
Jenna is a gift from the gods 😂😂😂😍
I’m dying! This is amazing
She looks like a character Zoe Saldaña would play
So much drama in the YouTube community atm and Jenna’s like yeah....I want a new face 😂
Jenna marbles having a mental breakdown for 12:54 minutes straight
WHEN SHE STARTED RUNNING—
You and Julien should both use a bunch of human prosthetic and relax in public places without being recognized. Like a regular human.
No one:
Jeffree Star in 2050 after the nuclear war:
ooh sH I T🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like the Grinch’s wife
Jenna looks like the alien hybrid version of Iggy
its like she is asking for more horror movie edits
Literally everyone else: James Charles vs Tati

Jenna: making a new face
wait why does she look like a purple grinch
Oh god the horror film people are going to make with this...
Kind of looks like Jeffrey star 👀
thanos needed a makeover
Literally no body: 
The beauty community:👀 
Jenna: I want a new face
you look like you’re someone off of the sleepwalkers😳
I think Jenna has finally lost her marbles 😂😂😬
Jeepers kreepers 4??
The purest YouTuber 😭😭
This is the number one beauty channel on YouTube
6:50 If Scary Terry and Thanos had a child
This is the funniest video I’ve ever seen. I love you.
What eyeshadow colour is this!!!
Please turn yourself to Dr. Phil
Bunny: breathes


Julien & Jenna:  good girl, yesssss!!!!
Use this as the “I signed up for this content button”
I cannot stress this enough: I can't wait for this woman to hit 20M subs. Stayed out of drama, kind, gorgeous, fulfilled privately and living her best life while providing genuinely epic and relevant content. Been a fan since 2010. Love you Jenna
jenna leaves for ONE WEEK on vacation and the beauty community perishes
Jenna: goes on vacation
Internet: blows up from so much drama with Tati and James
Jenna: comes back "I left y'all alone for ONE WEEK"
Bunny: exists
us and J&J: YEESS BUNNY
To Bunny: “That’s wonderful progress!”
To Kermit: “Youuuu’ve made backwards progress.” 😂😂😂
Is someone going to let Jenna and Julian know they accidentally rescued a baby deer and not a greyhound? Lol So cute
Jenna please come back, YouTube is a mess right now and we need you
When it comes to greyhounds and other hounds it is best to avoid toys that squeak as it elicits the predatory response and can cause resource guarding. I was a vet tech and trainer and removing squeaking toys goes a very long way :)
Jenna: I’m sorry if some you don’t really like this content. 
Me: I watched the 30min plant video twice
Had a real tear roll down my cheek when Jenna got kisses! Super adorable!! 
Also, when she's ready, I'm gonna need a compilation of her and Cermit crying together...
Marble heard everyone calling him dead so he decided to pick little fights with Bunny to let us know he's still in charge 🗣🗣🗣
Surely you already know, but zoomies are THE BEST SIGN that your dog is totally down with acclimating with your family/pack! Congrats!!
Bunny: breaths
Julian and Jenna: “YES BUNNY GOOD GIRL”
I've never known two youtubers more worthy of a one week vacation have an incredible time (can't wait for bunny's one month update when you return)
When she’s finally comfortable and understands how this community works, 3 words, Quadruple. Dog. sweater.
yall cheering her on when she was walking down the stairs is exactly like my parents cheering me on when i finally come out of my room after 8 days. incredible
Anyone remember when Kermit wanted all those big treats at the pet store? He knew Bunny was coming and wanted to get Bunny-sized treats!
Oh please, even if you turned this channel into Rescue Dog 101, we'd still love you. And everyone loves Bunny.
Marble= error 404 location unknown
cement= bicycle seat 1.0
Peach= bicycle seat 2.0
Bunny= bicycle seat 3.0
I just realized I watched 36 minutes of dog training and was thoroughly invested in the whole process.
Honestly. I need the same kind of encouragement bunny has at this point in the semester
Who else is here for good, wholesome content to take a break of #Sistergate? Thank goodness for Jenna ❤️
Bunny is the most beautiful horse ever! You guys are doing an amazing job, its so fun and inspirational to watch
"Some of you are not really interested in this content..."

Are you kidding? We live for these vids. We love Bunny!
Y'all bunny kissed both julen and jenna when they picked her up after vacation😭😭😭 bunny loves her mom and dad now we know😭😭😭😭😭
I love how Bunny taught Julien how to not be a tornado in the kitchen because he can't with her.  I also love her zoomies!
100% down for just weekly vlogs of Bunny and the gang
Jenna: its hard to get Bunny to hydrate sometimes
Bunny: pool?
“Hope I can show you guys tremendous improvement in a later video”

shows tremendous improvement in same video
It’s cute how Jenna whispers in her front garden. My neighbours are happy to scream and shout walking down the road 😂
Cermit: cries 
Jenna: (in cermit voice) "rêzçüé" 
I love jenna so much bless
Watching Bunny bloom into a regular dog is so heartwarming.  Thank you for sharing this.  Your love for all your fur babies is palpable.
who else is waiting for bunny to learn to swim👀 hahaha❤️
Marbles is literally the size of Bunnys head but he's fearless
This cearmét grew so much!!!
She big cermet
Good lady sirmette
Bisexual life: being desperately in love with both Jenna and Julien at once
Jenna: Goes on Vacation

YouTube: All the tea
I feel like Bunny might be Kermit's support dog 😂🐶
Bunny: breathes
Jenna and Julian: yes bunny yay good girl yesss good job yay
Me: :’)
Patch, cement, and mouthwash are the cutest dogs ever, now we have baseball to join the cute doggo squad
Bunny is so lucky to have 2 caring parents. I wish I could be bunny
"I bought a new pet video" - I do not watch that sh*t
"I adopted a new pet" - take all my views
can you make a clay version of ur dogs!!!!!!!! please and thank you :)
Julien: Turns his channel into a cooking channel
Jenna: Turns her channel into "Yesssss Bunny!"
Jenna the beauty community is in shambles again wya
honestly I think anyone wanting to adopt a rescue dog from anywhere should watch these videos and understand how much work it takes to provide a happy and safe home for rescue dogs ! I think it's absolutely worth it but people completely underestimate how much emotional+ physical energy it takes ! you guys are doing amazing !!
Me last night: I'm going to get up early and be productive! 

Me this morning at 11am: watches a 40 minutes video of bunny and starts happy crying
Your recognition of ALL of the BEST training methods is just....giving my heart wings. I've worked with dogs professionally for 15+ years and am sittin' here like a proud mother giving you high value treats and yessing you every time you do the same for Bunny <3
Please record her reaction to seeing you guys again after vacation 😭😭😭
The amount of care and dedication you are putting in to ensure your dogs are happy and healthy is admirable ❤️
I like your sensitivity to Bunny. Slow going seems to build a strong bond.  You're great parents!
THIS IS SO WHOLESOME. THE ZOOMIES MADE ME TEAR UP.
I am gud gorl
My name is Bun
I am grey houn
I lik to run 
I sumtime growl
But am not bad
Am workkn on
Not be so sadd
"Bunny come"
Kermit: yes, am bunny. am come. yes. is good girl.
PLEASE WATCH A VIDEO CALLED “The Nasty Files” it’s about kermit being nasty
She attac
She protec
But she also scared as hec
there were a couple times you guys said there wasnt tooo much improvement but she already seems like a whole new dog and there have been a lot of times where i dont really know how to train my dog with certain things and i think what yall have done is sooooo amazing and the filming is actually very helpful but more than anything im so proud of how far bunny has come

you guys are the perfect family for her! TuT
She will realize how lucky she really is soon. 🥰 Such a beautiful girl!!
Bunny’s gonna learn how to sit before Marbles
Bunny is just,,, the biggest mood. I love her. I wanna cuddle her she is such a good smart doggo
Jenna: goes on first vacation ever for one week




YouTube:  crumbles apart 🍵
her name is YESSS BUNNY GOOD GIRRLLLLLL
The iggys are outside right now. pans
Marble:👁👄👁
Never thought I would fall in love with a dog like I have with bunny wow
seriously though, is no one gonna talk about how cute the rescue game with Kermit was?? literally sent my heart into another dimension
Dog whisperer level is 110% better than Caesar Milan! 
We love these very real videos!
@33:07 a true dad moment. 💀🗣💯‼️
Jenna and Julien: Bunny come!
Bunny: slowly walks forward
Jenna and Julien: YES BUNNY!!
Bunny: sprints
I noticed bunny loves to be in water and drink lol. So cute! What about getting her her own little kiddie pool to sit and drink out of lol. Maybe not such a great idea lol 😂 but I love these videos. I literally look forward to every one of your videos, they just give you that warm, fuzzy and welcome feeling. ❤️
I came for Bunny and Jenna’s blabbing face is in the way

Can you do your commentary in the background pls
This is inspiring work! I am a vet assistant at an adoption center in San diego and I love how you are spreading the "rescue dog" story and experience! I am learning new things from you and you have great ideas (water with food, training techniques, etc.) If you have any questions or need any support, please reach out. I've been a subscriber of yours for years and this is the best informational content I've seen you create. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK JENNA! ❤❤❤
This is my dog's favorite video. He watches intently when bunny is on screen.
i love that marbles had the confidence to growl at bunny when he's literally half the size of ONE of her legs
Julien ought to make a cosplay of king Julien from Madagascar
I just realized how freaking huge bunny is compared to Kermit and Peach.
Watching this legitimately makes me tear up. Bunny and the way Jenna and Julien are so sweet and patient and encouraging with her is just so amazing.


My heart is so warm and fuzzy rn
Rescues take time....a lot of people return rescues because they think there is something wrong with them if they dont snuggle or play or just make themselves at home immediately and that is bs. It takes time, some take longer than others to adjust. ...you two are doing a phenomenal job
When will Jenna stop starting her videos with an apology:’(
The beginning made this feel like metaphor for helping someone getting over trauma,,, which is relatable?
Best rescue content ever made. in the process of rescuing a dog right now. I'm crying I love it so much
You leave for 1 week and YouTube loses its damn mind. No more vacation for u and julien
Watching the love and hard work your putting in for her is making my heart so happy
DO NOT DARE APOLOGIZE FOR THIS CONTENT. THIS IS WHAT WE ALL SIGNED UP FOR. WHOLESOME 32 YEAR OLD LADY ME TIME AND DOGS. WE LOVE YOU.
OKAY I KNOW IM WATCHING THIS LATE BUT I JUST WATCHED THE PART WHERE JENNA PLAYED RESCUE WITH KERMIT AND MY HEART HAS NEVER BEEN MELTED SO FAST😍😍😍😍😍😖😖😖😖😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Here to rewatch this video because there is vacation this week! I hope you guys are having fun and relaxing on your vacation
i love jenna so much! she's like the least problematic youtuber <3
Julians voice literally is the funniest when he’s talking to Bunny.

Also Bunny reminds so much of my dog (she’s a stray from Romania)
Bunny: walks down stairs
J&J: gives Bunny an Oscar
I love these videos!!!! I've always wanted to adopt a rescue greyhound, and I currently have my own Italian greyhound! I'd love to see more updates of her progress ❤
Bunny is my favourite child
Ngl I also kinda wanna know how Marbles' sitting training is going too. I LOVE BUNNY THO!
Ready for the Post Vacay Bunny vlog 🤞🏼
Bunny: is afraid of everything
Also Bunny: jumps headfirst into a pool
I love that there was an almost 20 minute video of you teaching the pups to swim and now you have bunny that can probably touch the bottom in the deep end
I never liked greyhounds before but now after watching bunny’s zoomys I have changed my mind
wow. amazing dog parents right here!! actually learned from this video. Thank you ♡
Bunny drinking pool water: FoRbIdDeN bEvErAgE
Jenna: Bunny come!
Bunny: me? I’ll walk just to be sure
Jenna: YES!
Bunny: ME
I always see Bunny to be more of a Mango. PEACH AND MANGO
Bro you left for one week and yt absolutely FELL APAAAARRT
If this is the only content we get for the rest of time.... I'm here for it!  Y'all have done a great job with Bunny and I legit cried when she kissed Jenna too <3
Come back!!!! The beauty community is crumbling! We need a beautuber to claim the throne
Bunny has made more positive life improvements in two weeks than I have done in 22 years.
My boyfriend and I always do a late night zoomies outside with the pups, its so nice, and then we all go inside and pass out lol
She is scared to exist in this house 
AGSGDHFH PEACHY'S LITTLE TINY "brorf" AFTER YOU SAID NOT TO BARK SHFHFJFJGJJFJGJF I love
Legit just subbed to her channel an hour ago and I already cried twice watching her videos, both times related to her dogs. I'm at the zoomies part and I am so happy omg
Bunny: being perfect and adorable
Kermit: Middle child syndrome intensifies
Thanks for sharing!!! What a blessing You are.
It’s so crazy how knowledgeable they are ❤️😭 they’re so good at this!
SUCH AN EXCITING VIDEO. OMGGGG. SLAY QUENN U R THE BEST. LOVE U. THE MOST INTERESTING VIDEO EVER. Y JTCOY
The moment you see them play is some of the most rewarding parts of training. She is such a doll!
bunny has not tried to use the jean chair as a toy because she has too much respect for the craftsmanship
Bunny making it down that second flight of stairs made me instantly cry
THIS IS THE GOOD WHOLESOME CONTENT I NEED IN MY LIFE
This was the wholesome content I needed today. Bless you Jenna ♥️
Bunny: goes straight for the pool
Jenna: no bunny leave it
Bunny: drinks 
Jenna: leave it
Bunny: but is happy place
You are like THE perfect person to adopt a rescue dog. So understanding and patient.
She looks amazing!! Perfect body condition for a grey
Awww that sweet moment when a doggo is happy enough to go nyoooooom
So weird that I never noticed before that you’re a guy- just another lying deceiver- sad
wait no i love this content!!!! love u and ur whole pack
I,m super thrilled you got a fourth dog.
No tears I just want your life to get better and better.
Because you deserve it!
30s in “this may not be the content you’re into” girl this is what I have been WAITING for!!!
And yet it took 2 years for marbles to learn to sit
You leave for vacation and for that whole week YouTube fell apart, PLEASE SAVE US JENNA
It'll take a while for her to get comfortable. Don't stress so much about it and just take each day as it comes. Good luck with the good girl!
I'm perfectly okay with this channel having more plant and dog videos and becoming YouTube's Animal Planet
Am an cheetah horse nammed bunny, favorite foods is hamborgars and pool watair.
I really respect you for the care you put in to give your dogs the best lives possible. 

I adopted my doggo like a year and a half ago and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done. Dogs, even through they are hard work, find a way of making an unbreakable bond with their family. My dog had food aggression for a while when we first got him, and it took a really long time to get him out of it, but he came through. Training dogs is the most rewarding experience ever.
who is complaining about this kind of content? Please don't apologize to people who feel the need to complain about this kind of content because it is epic priceless beautiful and relevant to being a good decent human being.
So glad to see Bunny is doing good! 
This video was very encouraging to me, as one also with a rescue dog that has some problems. He also struggles with resource guarding and is fearful to a lot of things. 
It’s crazy how much they can actually improve in only a week! So glad she is doing better and you guys are doing such a good job❤️
Girl who is telling you they're not into this content?!!
Wish I could fave this more than once it was so beautiful
Loving the bunny updates, she’s doing so well 💜
Awwwww you can just tell she’s a sweet girl! Y’all are doing an awesome job.
we rescued a dog last october and it was rough for a while. but she just went down our hallway for the first time after 6 months and into our basement shortly after. it is so hard but, you’re right, the payoff is amazing. she is the sweetest and most loving girl ever and every challenge has been worth it. you are such a great dog mama and you got this ❤️🥰🥺
She might think her name is “gOOod giiirl YAASSSSSS”
never thought id be hype to watch a 30 min video about someones dog
I love these videos where you show how you train your dogs. I have been working on dog training, as well as cat training (I’ve taught my cat a few simple commands). Your videos on this are wonderful and have taught me a lot more. They have given me ideas that I can include in what I do. 
I admire your patience with Bunny, truly. Even when she got in the pool and started drinking the water, you were so calm and gentle with her. You didn’t scold her or anything, just got in and brought her back out of the pool.
I’m literally crying from happens literally tears of joy ♥️♥️🙏😰
Bunny: breathes
Julian and Jenna: YESSS BUNNYYY GOOD GIRLLL
That dog NEEDS to run. Like full speed run. I used to ride my bike w/ the leash on my hand and let the 2 I had just run as fast as I could bike. Maybe a good 1/4 mile "sprint" at a time. Also they get hot in the summer. I made a cool jacket out of a dog life preserver and some gel ice packs. Also Grey hounds don't float well and "splash paddle" in water. They will claw you when swimming to you.
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for you bunny
I have wanted a greyhound for a while now and watching these videos makes me realize how much I love them and I can't wait for when I'm old enough and stable enough to adopt one.
My dog, now 16 years old (a rescue mutt from Romania), used to resource-guard. We trained him just like you - especially with food since he loves to eat. The funny thing is.. when he is playing he growls, mind you that his guarding/protection growl is deeper compared to his playing-growl which is lighter along with a smile and relaxed/playful body-language.
Everytime you say "I know that's not the content some of you are here for" it is 100% the content I am here for

we LOVE your dogs!!!!!
Is this ceasarment, Bunny, fully grown?!
It took a while for our rescue lurcher to come out of her shell but once she did she was the loveliest most affectionate dog ever! Greyhounds are the best! X
YouTube is falling apart without you
As an ex-racer Greyhound foster parent, I just want you to know that you are doing EVERYTHING right. Keep up the good work! Bunny will come around, just keep doing what you're doing. Congratulations!
"Bunny come!"
Kermit: I AM HERE : O
Marbles is a gangster dog, he tells you to get the heck outta his face, you better do it!
Water your cermit so it can grow!
I love watching 16:45 over and over bc J&J are such good puppy parents
Jenna... we need a new video from you now more than ever. We need our favorite DRAMA FREE YouTuber right now in the midst of all the crazy in the YouTube community 😂💕

I can’t wait to see your beautiful face! But enjoy your vacation! See you soon!
"this may not be the content you're into..." girl you're #8 on trending, this is what we want!
11:03 whenever they say "Bunny come!" Whoever is closer to her she looks up at them then slowly walks away before running. It's like she's saying "Ok I go there now bye bye" SO cute
Genuinely smiled about the zoomies!!!!
girl girl, Its not one step forward one step back! Good days and bad days! Something bad happening doesn't negate progress!!! I know it feels like it does, but it truly doesn't. BTW I am full on bawling my eyes out from the wholesomeness of these videos. Ya'll are the best most patient dog owners and I am so happy for you.
This is AMAZING info for all of us!!!!
Marble: buffers
Peach: hungry
Kermit: cries
Bunny: polite
I think you fed that cermet too many chickens. That cermet is much too large. 

;) I love her.
The zoomies part cured my depression. These videos cured my depression. Thanks Jenna & Julien for being the best doggo parents ever and for loving your babies and for just existing and making the world a better place. This is exactly what I needed to see. My life has been so sad lately and I needed this. ❤️
this video made me genuinely happy , thank you jenna
She's already an amazing dog, and you're an amazing person for helping her be the best her she can be and helping her live her best life
Bunny finally understands that her name is Bunny. : D

Unfortunately, now Kermit also thinks his name is Bunny.  D :
This makes me sooo happy, y’all are doing beyond wonderful 🦋💝💙👏💕🤗
if your view count on the bunny videos keeps climbing, that's all me. i just can't help but keep rewatching both of them. it's just so pure and emotional and she's so sweet and you're such kind, giving people. such a safe, hilarious, loving haven on youtube. thank you from all of us! <3
I need another update on Bunny!! I am emotionally invested now.
I was smiling ear to ear when bunny was doing zoomies, hers so cute!
Nobody:
Absolutely nobody:
Not a single soul:
Marbles: 👁     👁
                       👅
this is so interesting. also she is so incredibly good with dog parenting
i started crying when you were playing with her outside at night - she seemed so much more relaxed and like she is trusting you a whole lot more 
i think it's wonderful how you treat her <3 amazing content
I rescued a dog right around the same time you got Bunny. Ours is also a 3-year-old girl and is white with brown spots :)


Your journey with Bunny is echoing ours a bit, and thank you for bringing to attention the difference between getting a puppy and rescuing an adult dog who has a history and already-established personality. Taking things slow is important, especially when the dog you adopt has health issues like ours does or has never lived with humans likes yours.


There are challenges and joys in bringing home a new dog and I can't wait to see who Bunny becomes as a part of your family!!
2:27 exact representation of what people with glasses see (look at the coffee maker then look at it through her glasses)
All the treats Kermit picked in the “I buy everything my dogs touch” video came in handy for Bunny’s training
Now that the crying dimension has been opened, we need a video where it’s just bunny and Kermit crying at each other
I'd watch you do dog training videos! :D
I actually started tearing up when she walked down the stairs, as someone who has a service dog this is so relatable. I'm glad that bunny is doing to well and I hope you all have a good year 💕
This was such a great video. As an animal rescuer I totally understand the ups and downs so to speak. The way you guys are so committed and care so much about following her timeline is absolutely amazing and i will admit i teared up at your progresses small and large. You guys rock. Much love 💗
I love the wholesome genuineness of Jenna and Julien. its so different than everything else on the internet. thank you guys <3
Jenna's psychological degree is really paying off atm
How about another video update?!  I love seeing the progress with this beautiful baby!
This video just truly warms my heart. I've had Mr.Edwin my rescue Chow Chow mix for around a year now, I knew I loved him from the first meeting even though he'd been returned to the pound multiple times for being 'loud and aggressive'. When I brought him home for the very first time he was both very sweet and extremely anxious in a "bark at everything" kind of way but after around a month we where inseparable. I still show everyone I know pictures of him religiously because he'll forever be my baby. Bunny is my home girl and I know she'll come around soon especially with fantastic parents like you two
Jenna inspires me so much... I've been dealing with a lot of things so far this year and just watching Jenna's videos makes me feel so much more at ease. I love anything about her plants and pups ❤ (and I love Julien of course, I actually enjoy his cooking videos a lot)
Hi Jenna!!!! Happy to see everything you post:)
bunny, being content. being tucked into bed
kermit, hacking up his lungs in the background
jenna: good lord
No apology is necessary for your vacation, you deserve it!
I love these updates. You guys are amazing human beings.
Aw you guys are awesome, I was in tears when she had her zumies time. So happy to see you guys grow as a family.
Cermet: nasty boi
Marbles: angry boi
Paesch: slem thicc gorl
Rabbit: very good gorl/ sweet gorl
It’s so heart warming to see her zoom !! I couldn’t contain my happiness :’)
I don't know her and I love her 😍

I adopted 2 cats in January who came from a situation of neglect. I've had them for 4.5 months now and I'm still seeing improvements with them every week. The key is patience!
Jenna is so refreshing-always unpretentious and genuine. Such good doggie parents-Bunny is really growing in confidence  🐶
Okay, this game with Kermit is THE MOST precious thing I have ever seen
jenna: it’s progress, I know it doesn’t seem like much
me, sobbing: it’s so much progress i’m so proud
I’m so emotionally invested in Bunny’s progress. I just want to see her succeed and be happy!
I just wanna say. I had two greyhounds and lost them in the past 2 years. Zoomies are my absolute favorite and it made me smile so big when I saw her zooming around. You are doing a great job with her!
You went away for a week and all of YouTube was plunged into chaos 😂
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES MOONBALL SOUND LIKE ELMO WHEN HE BORKS OR IS IT JUST MEH
bunny’s improvement is so so noticeable. wonderful job parents :)
I feel like Bunny is one day gonna just jump straight into the pool.
are y’all gonna teach bunny to swim?
When she's running back and forth between them as they practice the "Come!" command, the way she's so excited with tail wagging just makes my heart so happy. <3
My whippet mix gets the zoomies after taking a poo as well 😂
"some of you guys arent interested in this content" 😡 

more dogs
This has been very informative, thanks for the info.
Yes! I adopted a VERY timid boy who had a very traumatic background a few years ago and it took a WHILE but he’s a completely different dog now than when I first got him, there are some things you have to accept that he’ll never do, but that’s just the way it is! So glad you got a rescue as the next addition to your furry family, can’t wait to see more updates as she grows more confident!
Universe and good bless you 🙏🙏🙏
I am so glad Bunny has you guys as her parents. You’re so patient and understanding, I don’t think a lot of people have that in them and you guys DEFINITELY do. It makes me so happy! 😭♥️
Bunny: Still trying to feel comfortable where she is.
Marble: Still trying to figure out where he is.
even though bunny is scared she has more emotion than marbles ever had in his life.
This video makes me so happy, watching how much progress she is making !❤️ she really has the best parents out there!
I remember when my aunt adopted her rescue whippet. She had cigarette burns and was the most timid dog id ever seen and it was so heartbreaking. and now its about 8 years later. And you would never have known, she has so much love and excitement and curiosity for everything, she's one of the most normal loving and open minded dogs I know. Bunny is on her way. What your doing is so amazing <3
I can relate to your happiness with her improvement, my puppy started having aggression after I moved back in with my parents, I made my mom feed her for a bit, and she stopped growling or fake attacking her, but she still won't stop "attacking" my father's foot, since he won't feed her, ever. Still I'm very proud of your bunny, she's beautiful!
The 15 pounds of snacks the dogs picked out weeks ago is coming in handy
RESCUE KERMIT OH GOD I AM CRYING AGAIN
I’ve been there. You have a very long road ahead of you❤️ good luck!
Cermet doesn't even know that he got the last shot of the video all to himself.
“you have made backwards progress” 

kermit: 🙂
Your new videos always pop up in my home screen, just realized I wasn't subscribed :( smh
It’s madness without the queen. We are waiting on the return!! 👀
Bunny is gonna be AMAZING ❤️
Hey jenna you should make soap like royalty soaps
You should get a bunny and call it dog
I love how you promote "safety"... some people judge why people shop vs adopt. I have 2 Siberian Huskies. One is a year and a half, the other is now 5 months. I BOUGHT them as 8 week old puppies, and they are half-sisters. I had to buy my dogs as pups because Huskies have high prey drive, and since I have 4 cats I couldn't adopt a dog that might eat/kill my cats. EVEN though I got my Huskies as puppies, I still have supervision/safety measures like they sleep in crates and have a "dog area" of the house etc So yeah safety always has to be first
From Minecraft to raising a paranoid dog, you run possibly the most wholesome channel on youtube.
You two are doing SO GOOD! We're proud of all your hard work and Bunny's amazing progress. She is absolutely precious <333
Weeping at this video she’s such a sweet girl!
“Bunny don’t drink the pool water”
Bunny: mm woter
So happy for you taking time off, you deserve it. Have a great vacation ❤
Y'alls teamwork is everything❤️
This made my day. She’s beautiful and I can’t wait for more updates
lol jennas going to come back from her vacation and the youtube community will be in shambles
Stop apologizing for vacations and posting what you want, we always support, do what you need to to be happy ❤️
Great job!❤ Don't want to brag but my rescue dog experience was exactly the opposite. She just knew everything from day one. Learned my commands really fast and bonded immediately. She hated showers (she needed those to get all the extra fur out nice and fast) but was super patient still. She has this amazing trust in her new family. Still can't believe that we got this amazing angel dog. But this makes me appreciate people like you who are willing to put in all the hard work to make the dog feel safe and welcome. Getting a rescue dog is an amazing experience. I recommend to all! But you need to prepared for the worst. But know that you will come out of it smiling and grateful.
how early is it in the morning? lol I its dark outside...
if you’re still looking for some quick tips some other “high value treats” my greyhound mutt loves are hot dogs and rotisserie chicken!! so so rewarding to see those zoomies and that play bow!! she seems so happy it’s so good to see how much care you are taking with her!!!
I think the first time I ever saw marble walk was in the first bunny video

No wonder people think he’s dead
You were gone for 1 week lol
Kermet: falls in pool, * gets traumatized *

Bunny: walks into pool, * this is da life *
She's come such a long way, you're doing a great job with her! Keep up the good work!
Omg you guys are amazing!! I bawled my eyes out when she did her first zoomies!!!! <3 <3 <3
We actually call them the poop zoomies with our dog 😂
Jenna, you're such a breath of fresh air on Youtube, intelligent, reasonable...oh wait, you've always been on Youtube and you paved the path. Thank you!!!
Bunny: pool water haz nutrients
Jenna: Leaveitleaveitleaveitleaveitleaveit. Bunny no, leave it.
Bunny: ...HAZ NUTRIENTS
I love this so much 😭❤️
All I want is bunny content 🥰
THANK YOU for educating yourself on rescue dogs and educations us too! ❤️
If you lined the dogs up ordered Marble, Kerm, Peach, Bunny and took a picture of them it would look like an animorphs cover... Or a pokemon evolution
Even when it's all about bunny, it's still always about kermit lol
Nobody:

Bunny: large confused fear
You deserve a vacay jenna. I hope you enjoy your time off :)))))
can you contact an animal communicator to speak with your dogs?
is it just me or does marbles barking at bunny for being on the couch seem like an old man yelling at a kid for being in his yard.
Can't wait for the next video! 😅
I am just wondering how close and unrelaxed your neighbors got to be for you guys to whisper outside at night xD you guys are so freaking respectful and wonderful
youve gotta be kidding me if you think i dont like this content, girl i live for doggo content
UGH I feel like this was way longer than a week ago. I can't wait another week!!!
‪Hi Jenna! You said bunny was scared of drinking water. My rescue was scared of drinking water out of mirrored bowls because of the reflection so we got her solid color bowls and it fixed it. Hope this helps love your videos and you so much! ‬
Bunny is probably going to be the most trained and well behaved beautiful girl ♥️🐰
When you’re better at training your dog than I am at training my child
I hope you have an amazing time on your vacation! We'll survive without a video, you should make sure you relax ^v^
Bunny video
Kermit: I think not
in all seriousness, THIS is how you properly train a shy, nervous pup, this is amazing. great job seriously keep it up
Oh my god the going down the stairs killed me
Convert the wine room into a doggy living room for peach, Kermit, bunny and marbles!
Just thought you would want to know. I just heard your name mentioned on the Young and the Restless -. Congratulations. 
May 9
aw what a sweet girl, i love her
Jenna's videos has turned so wholesome and most of her fan base is so positive. I live for this
Best content, I love how much time and effort you're both putting in to make her comfortable and work within your pack :)  this I feel like will help other people with rescued dogs and to not give up when its a little hard at first.
She's doing really well with the stairs but if you want to make it a little easier for her you could add carpet just to the tops of the steps if you didn't wanna carpet the whole staircase. Love y'all! 💜😊☮
Wow I really didn't expect this video to make me so emotional. Thank you for sharing this experience.
My favorite thing about this video isn't just the dogs (God do I love them 😍), it's hearing Jenna's thoughts and feelings. She always has some incredible things to say!!
bunny * breathes *

Jenna & Julian: YES!!!!👁👅👁
I would love another update video of bunny
Thank you for being so patient with her 💗❤️
I just want to say that I’m so grateful for your updates because I’m learning things about dogs and pets that I didn’t know about before.
Enjoy your vacay!  Looking forward to your next update 🙂
Kermit: addicted to crying 
Peach: addicted to treats
Marble: addicted to Jenna 
Bunny: addicted to drinking pool water
Seeing her be excited and playing is so lovely omg😭❤️❤️  you two are really good doggo mammas
God Bunny's life was so sad before Jenna & Jullian came along. I hope all those treats help her gain some weight though!
You guys are doing such a good job with Bunny and I'm so damn invested in this dog now holy hell.. seeing her progress is amazing. Her zoomies just made me smile like a big idiot and I MIGHT have gotten tears in my eyes from the fact that she gave you a lil kiss. Am I too emotional? I may be too emotional.
Hope you enjoyed/you’re enjoying your vacation 💛
Bunny is the example that if you water your cermet it will An gRoW
i’ve been conditioned to smile everytime she does a good “watch me”
Will both make the best parents!
11:25
I think u will need to say “YES” Instead of “come” 😂😂
I love the cheering when Bunny came down the stairs💖💖 and the zoomies! Omg😍😍 too cute
“the iggies are outside”
shows marbles standing aimlessly
i’ve been conditioned to smile everytime she does a good “watch me”
i need 50 of these videos please. this is phenomenal work from you two and i have teared up during both of these.
You guys are doing so amazing with her. My ex husband and I rescued an abandoned, 4-month-old boxer mix a few years  ago. The food and toy aggression against us and our Chihuahua literally took less than a week to train out of him because he was so young and so willing to learn.  He was like "All this food and these toys are mine? AND I get a little/older sister to kiss, protect, and annoy? 😁😁😁" lol. You are so brave for rescuing an older dog with 3 of your own to worry about. Keep up the good work. She is so incredibly lucky to have you. 

BTW, we did not fight over the dogs in the divorce. Petey (boxer mix) was always his and Honey (Chihuahua) was always mine. The funny thing is we have "shared custody" of the babies. 😂

Also, it's so funny because you guys play "Bunny come" with her and I play "Honey come" with my Chihuahua. My ex (now my mom) will stand at the far end of the park and we'll get her to sprint back and forth until she's exhausted (she has a lot of energy for a 10-year-old Chihuahua). 

Anyways, I'm rambling now. Keep it up and don't get discouraged! You're doing everything perfectly!
Ok, so like I know you're on a WELL deserved vacation right now, but when you come back could you do a Meme👏 Review 👏 Bunny Edition, because there are some very wholesome edits of Bunny
boy i was like where is the newest video but then i realized you guys are on holiday.
excuse my hostility earlier, but enjoy the trip you two :)
Bun-Bun is in the best of hands <3 This made me SO heart happy <3
This makes me so happy.  I cannot explain.

Bunny is one lucky lady.
THE FACT THAT SHE JUST WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE POOL IS SO FUNNY TO ME
You are doing a great job with her.  Is she having a hard time on the stairs due to the hardwood?  Perhaps a carpet runner?
I've used many of your tactics and the positive reinforcement. ...I trained  "trade " with my dog, and it works.
You guys are such good dog parents, I can't even imagine if you had your own human babies! <3
So sweet that you and Julien love her so much and are giving her a new life of love
Jenna marbles come back from vacation already youtube is falling apart without you
Jenna's psychological degree is really paying off atm
I just rescued a shibu retriever mix...this content is 10000% helpful.
I love this video.  Great job with Bunny :)
So there's a thing we do with our dog that's a holdover from when we got him (shelter dog but from a good family, so mild food agression but not much else) where we hold the food bowl for him. My dad claims it made him bond with us better? Idk, you might find it helpful. Also taking his food away to add something tasty and give it back, although that was for food agression so idk if it applies here.
You guys are such beautiful people your love for these Angel's makes my heart smile I'm praying she develops well . I just found your channel and I'm hooked thank you so much for what you do!!
Bless your soul 

She gon be a NASTY girl in no time 

Keep your head up
Everything you're doing with Bunny is fantastic!  You're so good with her!
I’ve literally just been watching your Bunny videos for like nearly the last hour. So adorable ❤️❤️❤️❤️. You guys have he most beautiful hearts. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I forgot about there being no video today... not gonna lie I was super excited 😭
love seeing bunny improve. you guys are great dog parents and it warms my heart to see her becoming more comfortable with you guys <3
Jenna: she's afraid of everything

Jenna, im in the process of adopting a rescue and your videos help so much!! I care so much about doggies & it makes me so happy watching your vids
Bunny: 
Cerematic: am uncomfortable when we are not about me
Jenna to Bunny: Good girl! 
Jenna to nasty boy Kermit: Good...Lord.
When I first got my rescue dog, she had never had toys. She would gather all of them and lay on them. It took three months to build trust. She’s Amazing now! And I love your dog videos. You guys are wonderful pet parents ♥️
Your eyebrows are the olive branches of peace
Bunny has such a cute big dog bark ❤️🐰
i'm A-OK will this channel being dedicated to the puppers. pls more bunny content!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bunny: exists

Jenna: encouragement

Bunny: 
omg please bring back your mom. she's adorable and funny as hell😂😂
I'm curious to know how Julien is channeling his Aries chaos while trying to keep a environment for Bunny.
Honestly im down for a 3.5 week update
I happy cried through so much of this video! I love and appreciate all the work you are doing for Bunny; and also love you indulging in Cermits ‘needs’ to be ‘rescued’.
They're not just training her, they're fully rehabilitating her. What a lucky girl to have found them.
Almost cried when she had the zoomies! Great work with her you guys 💜
peach and kermit look like such tiny puppies next to her
Come back from vacation already 😭 we need

Bunny: Did you mean: drink pool water
*POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT INTENSIFIES *
I’m so excited you guys get to take an actual vacation! You deserve it so much! Also Bunny is doing so much better now and I love seeing her progress 💕
When they did the my dogs draw my life and “Peach” said my name is no and bad. I’d Bunny did hers would be my name is yes and good girl
Omg all I keep thinking is did the previous owner feed her enough ;-;
We need an update on Kermit & Bunny's cry dimension.

i cant wait for bunnys first halloween costume
can you make bunny into a little russian lady?
I wouldn’t be mad about weekly updates indefinitely
Where is you get Bunny’s standing bowls from. I’ve been trying g to find something like that for my baby. Thank you!
Wow you guys are so good at this, I'm crying😭😍 been watching you for like 8 years now, so happy for you💜
is bunny an fully grow? why cermit and paech not growing?
Greetings from Russia!!!!😎
The fact that Marbles is the alpha of your pack never fails to be hilarious.
this whole thing is honestly helping me train my new puppy♥️ thank you for the wonderful resource!
This is ABA and that's what I do with kids are a career. Reinforcing everything positive. SO  much improvement can happen and so happy for her and for your growing family!! ❤️
We protect bunny at all cost😭😭😭😭
Our greyhound has the exact same muzzle color and everything 😂 
Also my dog was quite upset that she could not play with the squeaky toy in the video. She just stared at me lol
Bunny thinks her name is Yes omg
I was like wow this video is 36 minutes I'll start it but won't watch it all. So I finished it and I'm v proud of Bunny and can't wait to see her in the future!
24:30 the little jump that bunny did made my heart melt 😊❤
I'm so happy that people like Jenna exist on youtube. Such a beautiful person with a great heart. Such an inspiration to me and so many others. LOVE YOU JENNA !!!
You should make another cermit growing video with bunny ..
It’s so wholesome watching Jenna get older and more mature
I love when she is talking about bunny in the end of the vision Kermit just staring into nothing
She's so adorable I'm crying
idk why this made me tear up but it did, i love your content so much.
I have never seen someone care so much about anything and everything. Bless Jenna
Can you please do another jennas ratchet salon video PLEASE.

Edit:
\/ this is how many people want another one
Maybe do monthly updates or 6 week updates x
"I know this is the content that some of you don't want"


Jenna, this is all I've ever wanted
So sad what humans do to dogs to make them this scared. They hold the dogs like prisoners in blood banks. Thanks for rescuing and having the patience to nurture her into being a dog instead of an exploited prisoner. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i can’t imagine a better mommy and daddy for this doggy. love you both
I see those crocs and I'm judging you for them lmao XD
Hey, just saw a really dumb challenge...croc shoes full of shaving cream...why not?  I say you go for it! lol
Ah, Jenna and Julien's dogs:
Mubbles
Nasty Boi
Peachygurl
Yes
This has nothing todo with this video but can you do a couch update and info. I'm looking for a good sectional myself and love the look of yours. Was it worth it.
I honesty LOVE this content. Loving dogs and having a psych background made this sooo interesting for me ❤️❤️
Dead ass missing yall. I'm glad yall vacating and stuff but yall need to come back already
can I just say, I LOVE this content.  I've been following your videos since i was a freshly hatched middle school bean and your videos are always great, especially the pet ones. Im genuinely excited for you guys and I hope miss bunny feels at home soon <3
No one again:

Jenna: I apologize some of you aren’t super into this content

We’re ok with this!! >:D
I had to re-home a rescue because of some of these same issues and I have kids. I so hope he finds a home like yours with people that can and will put in this effort. ♥️♥️♥️
Truly that doggo has no idea how lucky she really is. She got adopted into the best family.
I know you went on vacation and you guys deserve it and I hope you've had a blast, but I miss your videos!  They're such a normal part of my life after so many years.
That’s so heartwarming :D
Im honestly so happy to see Bunny with such a loving and helpful family. It sincerely warms my heart.
You guys are doing amazing with Bunny! I'm happy for you! I can't wait to see her progress, she is a wonderful addition to the pack 💚🐕🐕🐕🐕
I really admire how much love you put into your babies. It makes my heart warm knowing these puppies are in such a caring home.
JENNA PLS REACT TO THE NASTY files ITS VERY WRONG ITS KERMIT AND PEACH
YOU SHOULD DO A COLLABORATION WITH @Dane !!!! Plzzzzzzz
8 years ago Jenna: he's crying so much it's making me sad!!!
Jenna now: Kermit your tears are not helpful
my dog was tilting her head to the squeek LOL
You guys have been watching @allthingspups haven’t you?! She’s the best. Love her training videos. Good luck
Ugh she is so, so lucky to have y'all as parents. This warms my heart so much. I've volunteered at animal shelters and now work full time in a vet clinic where sometimes pets aren't as lucky. We need more people like y'all in the world!
Dog zoomeez are the best thing on earth !!!
Never apologize for your content Jenna. Real Stan's watch everything you put out. We love our 32 year old lady!🎶
im so happy for you guys! iu love that you guys got to save her and give her a loving, wonderful home where she'll be able to live the rest of her life in peace. im so looking forward to you guys getting to see even more results of having her in your home and he rewards that will be bestowed on you guys for taking a chance on her <3 thank you for the update, you guys are doing amazing!
Love that she is so determined to help Bunny feel safe around her
You should do another teaching my dogs how to swim with bunny once she gets more confident with water, I loved that video
Omg she is soooo freaking precious!!! 😭❤️ so happy to see her doing well. She is in the perfect home ❤️
ppl not into bunny content aren't people we care about as far as im concerned
i love any content you put out because its you! also don't feel bad about taking the time to go on vacation!!!! we will live! you deserve time off!!
The way she plays and is running around is warming my heart.
I just noticed that you haven't uploaded to jenna marbles vlogs channel in two years, why ?
Congrats on the Y&R mention! ❤
Not to be dramatic, but I would literally take a bullet for bunny
My Siberian Husky sometimes barks too when she begs 😂❤️ She never grew out of it so we just let it happen. We tell her to “ask for it” when we give her a bite
I rescued a fearful lurcher (mostly greyhound) 4 years ago btw, and she spent her first 6 weeks peeing on herself under my bed. These days she sleeps on my face 😂 She was introduced into a pack at the time too, though there's only her and my retriever now. 

So I've been through a lot of the same things with my Mouse as you are doing with Bunny (Just realised they're both cute little animal names too) and I used to train dogs, too. So if you ever need any advice or just to talk to someone who gets it, you are very welcome to pop up in my PMs here and have at it. I understand the wonderful days and the days you just sit and cry too <3 Just know you guys are doing AMAZINGLY with her and I'm so proud of you.
Happy mothers day to you, Jenna, who became a mom for the 4th time after getting bunny. Hope vacation made this experience a lot better
Bunny's zoomies almost made me cry that was soooo sweet! These videos are best don't stop making them!
Bunny’s overall body language is SO CHANGED from her first video, so much happier/comfortable!
I could watch Bunny run back and forth between the two of you for hours.
You two should be so proud of what you're doing ♡♡♡
You are doing so well with her and it so amazing to see someone with millions of views talk about positive dog training, understanding dog behavior, and riding the ups and downs of adopting a new dog. Keep it up 🙌
“your tears aren’t helping.”
my friends and family to me every time there’s a problem and i just break down instead of solving it.
As an ex dog trainer, you guys are doing a fantastic job! Respecting her boundaries on her fears yet training her that they aren’t entirely necessary is a hard balance, so keep up the great work!
I wanna see bunny and marbles cuddling one day
bunny’s gonna think her name is Yes
It’s so heartwarming to see the time and care y’all are putting in to giving Bunny a proper home and making sure everyone is as happy as they can be. Love your videos and enjoy your vacation!! 💜
Watching this is so helpful in learning how to treat and train a rescue! I love this and I don't know if everyone will agree but I would love to see tons of Bunny improvement and training videos! 😄
This is so wonderful. I'm not sure if you realise how much of an influential figure you are, but in a world where a lot of youtubers use their dogs as photo props and clickbait, it's very beautiful for you to not only put the time, care and energy into making this dog feel loved and comfortable, but to also showcase that process for the rest of us to see and learn something. 

You're doing an amazing job with her and it's already paying off. Bunny is lucky to have been adopted into such a loving family ❤️❤️ thank you for setting such a wonderful example!
Kermit is me lol always needing some love
Having a new born is hard, don't apologize for neglecting your self care
remember you and julian told me that the next dog you want is cement
Ok like you could upload only dog updates and I would watch it all with a huge smile and genuine happiness
Oh my lord. I never wanted this video to end and I absolutely love Bunny. She's so sweet and nervous... but what got me is Jenna playing rescue with Kermit. That shit made my heart explode
@24:40 ASMR👂👂 TINGLES TINGLES TINGLES
Wow, zoomies already!
U R SO BEAUTIFUL PARENTS ❤️🔥
ADOPT  ME 
PLEASE
I genuinely believe that Jenna's animals are some of the most loved and well cared for animals in the world
haha bunny come, good come
This makes my heart happy. Dog training is hard work and it looks like you are doing an incredible job!
I laughed so hard when she started sniffing at the Jeans Chair Ruins. She's judging it.
Marble is so well trained, it's like he actually understands you
bunny 100% thinks her name is YESSSSS at this point 😂😂
Hi Jenna! You said bunny was scared of drinking water. My rescue was scared of drinking water out of mirrored bowls because of the reflection so we got her solid color bowls and it fixed it. Hope this helps love your videos and you so much! ‬
Please keep up with the updates I love this content !!!
Getting a greyhound can be really tough sometimes, everything is SO new to them. It took almost a year for my grey's personality to really shine through. Keep up the awesome work, it'll pay off!!
You guys are absolutely fantastic dog parents. You understand your babies so well and always do right by them. I have a rescue greyhound too and she was quiet like Bunny at first. I can promise this will be one of the most rewarding things ever, she's so lucky to have you guys, you're doing amazingly 💕
“BUNNY COME” 
cermet: yes, that’s it... that is indeed...my que...will run ... must run
She already looks so much happier and is doing dog so well ❤️❤️
Another successful week. Keep going!
Was surprised to hear your name, honorably mentioned, on The Young & The Restless.
Jenna you are doing such a good job. I love you both so much and these videos have made me so happy
i feel such kinship with another Large Queen
I APPLAUD YOUR TRAINING TECHNIQUES YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY THIS MAKES ME THAT YOU GUYS ARE SHOWING THIS. You're genuinely educated in dog training and in turn I think it makes more people aware of animal behavior and how you can easily and safely integrate a new dog into your home!!! So happy❤❤❤
This literally warms my heart so much, :’)
At first when I saw the thumbnail and saw the title I thought you were “blind” because I saw a dog and not a bunny so I thought you were “blind” XDDD I literally can’t stop laughing right now


And I’m sorry if you are offended or whatever that I thought that XD
Such a sweet girl with such loving parents. I’m tearing up- she’s so lucky to have you, and you’re so lucky to have her. Best luck with future progress; I can’t wait to see more Bunny!
loveeeeee these videos they really make my day!
She protec
She attac
But most importantly 


She whine to Kermit bacc
i love this content. seeing you guys so calm & patient with such a sweet dog. you guys are amazing ❤️ i’ve seriously learned sm from you guys
now all that's missing is a KITTY!
I could watch you play rescue with Kermit all day
You’re doing a great job! We have a rescue whippet catahoula leopard mix, he was just as nervous as she is but after a few months he’s fit right in with his chihuahua mix brothers (and a cat). We struggled with separation anxiety and he would self harm but now he loves his crate and has no trouble being left alone. Keep up the good work! The love you get from them is so worth it.
Marbles really out here being the smallest boy in the whole pack & willing to fist fight everyone at anytime
I love your heart <3
Was Bunny abused before?  Is that why she's a rescue?  Or just abandoned?  I've never seen a doggo so scared of everything :(
she has a full-size-bicycle-seat head 
i love her
I cried watching this 😩😍
please start calling them the Iggy's and the Biggy!
your kermit rescue performance was captivating
Love your new content!!!! Thank you for being such an amazing person!!! We love you guys!!!! Have a fantastic vacation!
Are we going to see you on Young and the Restless. They said your name twice today on the show
Whenever you’re lost in Bunny’s sweetness Kermit is always there to give you some nasty
this is so informational and i absolutely love these videos
ooowwww my heart!! i love you guys, such genuine caring people <3
I’ve learned more about dog training through these videos than the classes I paid for with a trainer 🤣
You and Kermit playing rescue me is the cutest thing in the world
You should rescue Kermit From his depression next
OMG the first ZOOMIES! A great moment in any dog parent life
good luck with her sitting on you eventually
This is so beautiful to watch. You guys are so dedicated and I can feel the love
I'm not one to leave comments on anything really, but I just have to say it's awesome that you both are taking so much time with bunny making her feel safe. Warms my heart. As another 30 something year old lady you are only YouTuber I actually follow, and watch each video. 

Also am I the only one that is hoping to hear you & Julian are engaged after vacation? I just love you both together.
YOU 👏 NEED 👏 TO 👏 STOP 👏 APOLOGIZING







ur amazing and we all love you. ❤️
I cried at this shit! I’ve always had a dream of rescuing a greyhound!!😪😂
Please react to Jenna marbles ruining Harry Potter
sobbed through this whole video!! love is really something else, best thing in the whole world!!!
Grayhounds are feline canines...they curl up in a little ball❤️
"The iggys are outside"
Pans to marbles standing outside like the creature from It Follows
Can you do a 18th century hair tutorial??
I can't wait for the next bunny update she's such a beautiful girl
Bunny just warms my heart!
My family and I had rescued a dog from an abusive home about nine years ago. For the first two weeks, she didn't make a single sound and we weren't even sure she knew how to bark. Once she made her presence known, however, she was warm and loving and sweet.
Watching Jenna having to chase Bunny out of the pool is probably my favorite part.
Jenna's psychological degree is really paying off atm
She has my birthday! ♊️ Season
What a wonderful update! I can truly see a small difference in her and she seems to look more at ease and happy. The zoomies part was amazing! But my favorite part was Jenna’s reaction to her giving her a kiss. You are such loving, wonderful and patient people. 

Enjoy your vacation and I look forward to more future Bunny updates! ❤️
Im so happy Bunny is part of the family ❤️
Jenna never has tea/drama, she's a sign of peace, which I live for.🖤🌬
Vlog-style dog-only Jenna content is my JAM.
I love how the “ceremet” needs to be “rescued.” 🤣🤣
the rescue game with kermit is probably one of the most charming and sweetest things i've ever watched :) jenna is SUCH a good dog parent. or parent in general, really.
Аааааааа, не могу привыкнуть к этому голосу, камеди стор, спасибо тебе....
Marbles is the old man that always yells "GET OFF MY LAWN YOU HOODLUMS"
Jenna! I saw you mentioned on Y&R! Congratulations! That's so awesome! I hope you make a guest appearance! You are really making it big. I'm so happy for you. And you're still so humble and down-to-earth and kind and just all around a wonderful person. I have been watching you for 8 years and I hope you never leave the platform. Thank you for making great entertainment just by being honest and letting us into your life as if your subscribers are friends to you. You are the most genuine person on YouTube.
Crying at Bunny’s first zoomies😭😭😭
I would recommend not using toys that make a sound, for them is like a little animal screaming and makes them more aggressive because they feel like that’s a prey!!!
the noise kermit made at 27:19 has me weak
Jenna, I train rescue dogs and often deal with shy dogs. I just want to say you are doing an incredible job. It feels weird, but I've watched you forever and I'm weirdly proud of how well you're doing. Thank you so much for being an awesome dog person.
I have so much respect for how you guys are handling this. You are so patient, caring and loving. It's wonderful to see.
at 2:10 you can see the blurry background perfectly in her glasses reflection
THANK YOU FOR THIS!   I rescued a pitt lab mix 2 years ago when she was 4.  The only training she had was not to bite or bark at the kids in her previous home but the punishments were severe (electric flyswatter, bb guns, etc.)  It took months of training and counter conditioning to get her to where she is now.  Too many people take on a rescue without considering that they WILL have to train them this way.  It takes weeks and months of work, and love and serious effort on our part as the humans, to help these dogs feel safe and understand what the boundaries are.  
 
Now here we are at a point where if I had to I (or anyone in the house) could literally stick my whole arm in her food bowl while she's eating and she just goes around me like "oh okay, you need something here... sure"  no growl, no distress for her.   She's still afraid of Nerf guns and electric fly swatters but she doesn't go nuts like she used to, she just makes a noise to let us know she's uncomfortable and then goes to another part of the house.   She's become very protective of the kids and cats, if we yell or get loud with a child she will put herself in the middle and sit very still, if it escalates to more yelling she will bark to let us know "my protec. you cannot yells now" and we let it go for another time or lower our voices.   She's the doggo mediator now.  LOL
Jenna: she just gave me a kiss, I’m gonna cry
Me: I’m also going to cry
Maybe she will drink better out of a plastic bowl, some dog's just like that more. Not sure why but I know a few dog's who do.
I love seeing the frightened horse become less frightened
i miss the paraffin bath bring it back for another vid
You guys are so awesome! As someone who has an ex racer greyhound I see so many familiar things that we experienced with her. You'll learn her quirks and personality and then itll get easier I promise 💕
I loooove videos like this! Enjoy your vacation x
My mom had rescue Grayhounds...Electra and Pearl-magical creatures. They got the 5,000.00 Ralph Lauren couch to curl up on, I got the floor. Grayhounds love marshmallow! Brush teeth after❤️🐶
Bunny: breathes air
Jenna and julien: GOOD GIRL!!!!
Kermit: sits
Jenna and julien:ya nasty boy
She has almost 20 mil subs from messed up beauty and dog videos.... and I’m not mad!
Эх жалко что ты на русском не говоришь 😂 только можно смотреть тебя на комедии стор 😭
When bunny goes into the pool u can say “ah” because it’s sharp and loud
I am awe-inspired by your training - I trained as a vet and I'm still learning things from your tehniques, it's awesome!
i am SO INTO this content you could do this forever and i’d love it
Awh I love her so much
Lmfao watching this with all the “Bunny come” my dog which is also a rescue and we got her and her brothers last yr on April 4 at 4 weeks old. Our bunny was losing her mind trying to figure out why you kept calling her to come!! Lol
She is quickly falling in love with yall
Peach reacts to Bunny, and Bunny reacts to Yes xD
edit: hi jennajulien and wolfpack
we like watching your momvlogs
stop thinking we don't :)
love ya goofs 


i'm still trying to understand who this demographic is that jenna refers to as "doesn't like this type of content"

i enjoy anything from this channel, and if jenna feels comfortable about uploading her life as content, why is it less valid from any other content being made?

i personally think this is cool to have a new member of the jennajulien wolfpack squad, and enjoy having this new family dynamic unfolding before my eyes on a weekly basis

you do you gurl
Greyhound are really different dogs and most cannot or don't like sitting because their bone structure doesn't allow it. My grey will NEVER sit out of his own accord and sometimes won't eat breakfast or dinner because he's not hungry. Give them time, space and they love you in time. My grey didn't start loving me until 6 months after adoption. If there is resource guarding, give a stern NO and take the toy away. Don't reward it.
Thanks for this type of videos! I have two dogs, and I simply dont know how to train them, mine are rescue too! so thanks!
Jenna I am so proud that you are so knowledgeable and responsible! You are amazing and awesome!
Okay for real... You guys are great parents... And the kiss made me cry
Oh hell she will get over the loud noise. It’s not a step back.
This is such a wonderful video. You guys are doing so great with her and I for one LOVE the Bunny updates. She's so beautiful.
You guys should get ceramic bowls for her and stairs could be easier with a carpet runner bc hardwood is hard on their legs
Resource guarding is absolutely normal! I’ve had 4 rescue dogs in 5 years. All four have had their different struggles. You are doing exactly what you should be when it comes to behavior around a rescue animal. It takes time for them to be completely comfortable around people and animals. Just hang in there and keep up the treat training!
Bunny could not have found better dog parents. Shes so sweet.
i saw my future
I looovveee this you guys are great! You do you! support always!! 🥰🥰🥰
Kermit playing Rescue just proved to me that he is a literal human child
ok i'm sorry but everytime julien used his "dog voice" i had to laugh
okay but julien's voice when he's talking to the dogs
More videos like this pleeeease.
i was on the brink of tears so many times ??? Haha lovee
It never ceases to amaze me how much effort and research and time you and Julien put into making these beautiful creatures feel happy and safe and healthy. What a wonderful pair of humans you two are. ❤️
I thought you had a pet rabbit I was so confused for a minute when you started talking about it growling
Peach: chaotic good
Marble: neutral evil
Bunny: neutral good
Kermit: chaotic nasty
I love how she immediately drinks pool water. I have a boxer who refuses to drink water unless it is in a cup or from a pool
Also Julien rocking them crocs LMAO
How did you come up with bunny? Love the name! You’re doing awesome! Enjoy your trip! Us mature adult people get it. You’re doing what you can & we love you! Don’t listen to complainers/trolls/advice givers. 😝 btw I train dogs and you do a great job doing your training! 👌👏👏👏
Why are you whispering?
Jenna: LOoK MaRBleS We GOt a BIgGEr DOg
Marbles: am i a joke to u?
Julien has reached his dog dad final form with the Crocs and the fanny pack.
Jenna: we’re getting a dog
brings home horse
names it bunny
Cement: finally someone who understands my language (cries in dog)
Peach: 👁 👅 👁 
Marble: who brought a horse into the house
Bunny: Big girl.

Peach: Small Girl.

Kermit: Whiny Child.

Marbles: Small Potato.
“So maybe they’ll both cry at each other and create another dimension and then both go into it”😂😂😂
She protec
She attac
But most importantly 
She don’t eat iggys as a snacc
Marbles: personal space exists
Peach: it’s free real estate
Jenna: "We're going on a long long life journey together, are you excited?"
Me: cries for the next 20 minutes
The 1.8k that disliked, message me your address. We’re fighting.
Jenna: “were gonna start with our most socially confident— Kermit”

Kermit: cries in socially confident
6:26 why i love jenna. shes so respectful. remember when she made a 40 minute long apology video about a fish? 🥰
It is so sad that an animal that was being used to save other animals wasn't shown love and appreciated for its sacrifice. Thank you so much for finally giving this girl what she deserves, love and respect. God bless you.
Boy energy? If marbles has energy at all it's tired, old, gay, diva energy
Jenna’s dogs as my moods:

marble: tired
Kermit: depression 
peach: anxiety 
bunny: shyness
"Apologies for becoming a dog YouTube channel" 
As if that's a bad thing
Your intro is a squeeky toy. You've been a dog channel this whole time.
"Peach, you're gonna be a big sister!"
Peach: * is smol *
This is like, textbook demonstration of how to introduce a dog to an existing pack, how to desensitize a shy dog without overwhelming or pressuring... like the level of understanding I see and the level of compassion is unmatched. I worked as an adoption counselor for almost three years, and you guys are gold star level adopters. People like you came along every so often and would go above and beyond for their rescues, and it is honestly inspiring. I wish you guys and Bunny a long and happy lifetime together!
i cried when they helped her up the stairs why is this so precious
“She is the dog that she is, and we are here for whatever that requires”

We need a j+j life quotes book. This goes under dog ownership chapter.
Best dog parents ever. The effort you put in and respect you have for your babies is amazing. Also, 100% for this being a dog channel.

Also, every time you said "park," my dog got excited.
Jenna is the most wholesome person on YouTube and I love her and her puppers. 

Protect her at all costs.
3 girls and 3 boys?,  you mean 3 girls,2 boys,and 1 rock
this dog is gonna be raised better than i was, i can already tell
"she cries every time she smells kermit. she can smell his sadness" bunny is an empath and I'm here for that
So now we got
One half dead Oreo
A piece of cement
Moldy peach
And one l o n g boi
I love how conscientious you are of your filming. New you tubers aren’t like that. You’re so polite.
no one: 

julien: dad breathing
The marble pep talk it literally the cutest thing ever
Other Youtubers: "We'll film as much as we can "


Jenna: "We'll film as much as appropriate "
Honestly when they said call her another fruit name I was like.. Mango!
Can y'all be my parents? I'm almost 23... But. Maybe just hug me?
It would’ve been cute if they named her daisy. (Like peach and daisy from Mario cart)
Oh no someone watered  that ceremit  alot
marbles was really listening to jenna when she was telling him about boundaries
Foster dog parents:*do you want to ado-*

Jenna:*yes.*
bunny in the corner while julien picks up the toys is a MOOD
Y'all are the best dog parents wow. Bunny's lucky to have such caring owners like you.
"were going on a long long life journey together. are you excited?" im CRYING
"Maybe they'll cry at each other and create a dimension and go into it" 2019 wasnt ready for that relatable content
I love how marble is just listening as you’re explaining boundaries 😂❤️
How could 1.9 people dislike this. You teaching people how to be more humane. Bunny is so beautiful and you are loving dog parents.
She’s so big 😭 and she looks like a little ant eater too
"Well, we'll check back with you on friday"
1 second later
"Its friday my doooods"
God i wish time flew by that fast 😂
The iggies look incredibly smaller now compared to Bunny but Marble literally is an ant now.
The full family!
Meatball
Parsec
Centimeter
and Bunp
My rescue dog died about 2 months ago and I love this so much. I’m sitting here sobbing because I love it when dogs get homes. And because I miss my Ida girl. 💕
You did so great handling the dogs! You used the perfect amount of positive reinforcement and boundaries without spoiling them! Congratulations and good luck with the expanded herd!
💝💙💕
Y’all are so educated in acclimating her, and she’s beautiful!!
Shout out to knowing when it is and isn't appropriate to film. That shit classy.
I feel like they would be great parents if they ever have children 😍😍
Virgo: we don't know yet
Aries: We know
This is such awesome timing! My husband and I are getting a retired racing greyhound soon, and it's super helpful to see a real adoption and the process of a dog who is "new" to the "real world"
14:00 SIPPIN’ ON STRAIGHT CHLORINE 💃🏽
u got duped.... accidentally brought home a baby deer....
not to be dramatic, but i would die for marbles
So she was kept in a lab for blood donations? I didn't know that was a thing. 😕
little meeble is getting so old it makes me so sad, hes the og, when he actually does die i'm gonna cry forever oh my god
everyone talking bout how the dog’s a horse, peeps no
I love how the auto focus struggles to pick up the distance between her nose and face. Long gurl.
You made this so informative Im not a dog person but so impressed by your family (pack) amazing
I adopted a 3 legged golden retriever puppy 😍 
Im so happy for you and your new doggy.
Such a rewarding experience ❤
It makes me so sad to see that the there are dogs like this who have never had any experiences or love or a name even. This is what made her so timid and scared and my heart breaks hearing she's been going through that for 3 years. So glad y'all adopted her!❤️❤️
imagine if your parents just brought home a big-ass version of yourself and were like, “this is your sibling now”
She’s honestly so cute and the perfect mix of peachy and Kermit in the best way.♥️😂
can you explain the name 'bunny', why'd you pick it?
thank you for sharing and allowing some of us who can't own a dog to live vicariously! you guys are awesome <3
Literally love Jenna giving marbles a talk on respecting boundaries 😂
The melon
The crying one
The smol grump
The Easter bunny
Bunny will be ready for your basketball game tomorrow... not today.. but tomorrow.
Bunny reminds me of a big and gentle alpha. She protect, she Attack, but most importantly, she empathise with the pack 🥰.
Congratulations on getting the only low energy greyhound that has ever lived
It took my rescue greyhound a good six months come out of his shell. He's a different dog now and he's wonderful. Bunny is a lucky girl!
I love how she talks to her dogs like they can understand full sentences 😂
Ah yes that new cermet was watered and given chiken correctly she is full grown
Another thing I wanted to say is how happy I am for the foster dad, because he can always come to your page and see how loved and we’ll taken care if she is. ♥️
congrats on your new horse, she's beautiful ♡
(clap)(clap)(clap) wish more of the new owners understood that the pack has to make adjustments and she will find her place in the pack as she gets more comfortable in her new home
Now cement, papaya and the dead one has a friend, burrito
Jenna & Julien: goofy all the time
Also Jenna & Julien: the most responsible people I've ever seen
Day 1825 of Jenna asking Julian for another dog.
She finally gets another dog.
When she said when she cries when Kermit cries I literally start laughing cry 😭 lmao 😂  The another dimension had me rolling.
Omg I love you guys so much right now. I work with a rescue and every day I am trying to talk to people who have no clue, and often no interest, in how to respect the needs of a new pet. The way you guys care... It's beautiful. (btw it took about 4 years for my rescue cat to trust me completely but now we are best buds)
"it's been 9 years and 11 years" woah woah Jenna stop reminding me how long I've been watching your videos you're making me feel old lol
Jenna went from party girl with crazy hair and makeup tutorials to wholesome dog mom
DONT. Apologize for becoming a dog channel
this video is so peaceful
i can't stop smiling
She seems so anxious...poor thing...adjusting is gonna be a bit tough mentally...😔 wish you all the best🖤
When they first brought Bunny home, I was scared she might sit in Marbles at some point
Things that make Kermit feel safe:
1. Nothing
2. Wearing a diaper
3. Having a lomg sister who cries with him
I’m actually crying this is such a wholesome experience that you shared, and informative and I’m just so filled w joy for you all
Watching this on my bed with my big rescue greyhound and when Cermet and Bunny cried he got up and looked for his kin 😂
Also greyhounds are known for being protective of our space. If other animals go too close to our guy when he’s sleeping on his bed he does a little growl but has never snapped.
You guys are seriously the best dog parents ever! Bunny is so lucky ❤
You guys are both  amazing human beings.  Just so real with such big hearts!
“She’s the dog that she is and we’re here for whatever that requires” 

BYE IM CRYING
I have a skittish Pomeranian and she has really come out of her shell. What I have done with mine is encourage but I also don't react to her concern or her anxiety. I don't feed her anxiety, I feel confident and that in turn gives her confidence. Also, let her smell things, it will help quell any concern. Most dog are ruled by their noses and so when they can smell things along. I got down on the ground and played with my dogs and it helps too.
Its amazing watching how well you both understand dogs and how to take care of them. Its really lovely seeing the love and care you are putting into this, made my day <3
I remember the day you cried getting Marbles, it's crazy to see him go from a baby the oldest brother, I can't believe it's been so long
I have so much respect for the way they respect their animals. It is one thing to say you love your pets but they show is through their compassion and willingness to go along with whatever timeline and space Bunny, and their other 3, need. This entire video made my heart so happy
Bunny @ Kermit: bro, please don’t cry, if you cry, i’ll cry
Julien and the Giant Peach
Please make a teaching bunny to swim like you did with peach marble
I’m so so so happy you guys adopted her and are giving her such an awesome home❤️ there’s not enough people like you in the world! And I’m also so glad you took the proper steps and time to introduce them together, and also so glad she is muzzle trained! I think muzzle training is so important for every dog. 10/10 so happy with this video and I’m an avid animal lover and trainer! Not enough people have the patience and responsibility to do proper training. 
Rescue dogs are a lot of work and I’m glad you’re one of the people who can handle it! Just got myself a new rescue baby in February and my oh my has I been a journey, but such a worthwhile one! 
He also had some resource guarding issues, as many rescues do. It just takes a lot of time and patience. 
So sorry for the long comment I’m just so glad someone else in this world is being responsible and is knowledgeable about this and has a passion for what I do, too!
Welcome to the marbles fam! We have: 
The dead one
The whiny baby
The food driven one
And the one that think screens are gonna kill her
She protecc 
She attacc
but most importantly
she whines bacc
When you guys helped her up the stairs 😭❤ oh my god, seriously 😍😍😍 this video was amazing ❤ please keep updating us as she settles in, you're doing such a great job ❤❤
Even though Bunny is cute and all Kermit is still my favourite because he cries every day xd
I remember watching the video of Jenna getting Marbles. This is a beautiful progression
You guys are the most incredible people for doing this. The amount of dedication and time you put into your dogs is just amazing. She’s in a great home with great people. love you both so much
"very timid and very shy" I can't wait for her to turn into a little monster like all of siblings
Peach is so precious I love her so much
"Apologies for becoming a dog YouTube channel. "

APOLOGIES?????
8:28 and the Julien's face...bruh, my heart
You guys are wonderful people, I wish there were more like you. Also, never apologise for becoming whatever channel you feel like at the moment, we're just happy to tag along <3
Peach and Kermit: who are you
Bunny: I'm you but stronger
Did she come from the blood bank in Cherokee, TX?
I love everything about this video. Thank you for rescuing an adult dog who needed a home and love. Y’all did such a good job at introducing and understanding boundaries and learning. I love adopting dogs and you also showed how difficult dogs can be and it’s not easy and you shouldn’t just get them without knowing it’s a full time job. We need more bunny!!!
this video made me extremely happy, i love how they take care of their family
You guys are such amazing and responsible dog owners I’m crying this is too much 😭😭
Kermit - not a puppet
Peach - not a fruit
Marbles - not a children's toy
Bunny - not a small animal

All of them - Very good dogs
me and julian had the same birthday ❤️
im looking forward to my 30
Jenna obviously not being able to control herself from just hugging the dog is a BIG MOOD
Omg April 17 was also my birthday 😂
Can you please do a video that will help with training older dogs? First dog and I really have no clue on where and how to start 😭
The Cermet is full grown. You watered it well.
You both have such sweet voices when you talk to her and support her. It’s melting my hearrrtttt 💛
The only time where you get an actual dog, you name it bunny 😂
They are such good dog parents, I cried <3
She protec 
She attac
but most importantly 
she whines bac



Oml I've never gotten so many likes lol
I love you all the more for really taking the time and showing what an involved process it is to get a new dog, and that you're teaching your viewers how much effort goes into this. 

It's clear to me (as a 44 year old mom with a 22 year old kid) that if you two ever decide to have children, you'll do a really amazing job. The two of you are fantastic team. I'm really proud of you.
This is the most heartwarming thing I have ever seen and makes me excited to get a dog someday <3
'When we do go into her foster home, I'm not going to be filming, I don't wanna ask, I think it's inappropriate.' Such respect!
i am so happy and impressed and you're doing this in such in a amazing way and this vid is so emotional and lovely bye
"She cries every time she smells Kermit, she can smell his sadness"
she will end up being Kermit's very own emotional support dog.
You guys should have Jeffree Star’s diva wolf pack over for a doggy play-day!! 💖🐺
I wonder if becoming blood donors is what will happen to many of the former racing dogs now that Florida banned Greyhound racing
Literally crying I'm so happy for you all! 🐶❤
She looks like a Bambi to me! XD


Regardless, what a cutie Bunny is!
Can't wait for the 'Bunny and Kermit crying at each other for no reason for 3 minutes straight' videos
It can take months for a rescue to feel at home. And I think you're doing great with her. Keep up the good work and have a lot of fun with the whole pack. ❤
Thank you so much for taking care of your dog's teeth! I work in an animal hospital, and I think it's so important that dogs have good dental care! Just imagine if you didn't brush your teeth for 3 years!
I look forward to seeing her gain a little weight. I know greyhounds are streamlined but she needs just a little filling out. Bless you guys for everything you're doing. 💖💋
Bunny is such a sweet girl omy I love her and she isnt even my dog.
1. Bunny is GORGEOUS. 
2. Marbles DEFINITELY understood that lecture you gave him.
Wow. A very well thought out meet-and-great strategy for the pups.
Thank you henna and Julien for being such wonderful people 💕
next video MEET GREYHOUND OUR RESCUE BUNNY
So incredibly beautiful... Tears falling all over. Best family a dog could ever want! Sending love to you all❤️ congratulations!
The iggies’ snoots look short now compared to Bunny’s magnificent snoot
I absolutely loved the ending of this video, it's so important that peoplw understand dog's body language. You two are incredible, best of luck with your new baby. 💛
You are great greyhound parents <3 I have been the happy owner of a fearful retired racer for about a year and a half now, and it's definitely a unique process. There will absolutely be challenges (as you alluded to), but you're doing a great job helping your girl adapt to her new life. Ours took probably 6 months before he stopped being scared of basically everything (and we're still working on some things), and it's been such a joy to watch him grow and overcome his fears. I look forward to seeing you all watch Bunny grow too :)
I'm gonna cry? This is some of the most heartwarming content I've seen in the 21 years I've been alive
That’s actually a whippet and not a greyhound. Very cute though. Love the video.
what if Kermit is teaching her how to speak in cry? 

Cermet:  repeat after me *cries in hello*

Bunny: 
Julian has the same birthday as me! ♈ Aries rules
You guys are the only valid YouTube couple
Thank you for choosing to adopt! You guys are great pet parents x
Omg! This got me emotional 🥺❤️
“Apologies for becoming a dog youtube channel”

”Becoming”
The recipe also calls for 1/4 a cup of cats
OMG WHY AM I BAWLING?😭💗So many emotions in one video.
When dogs put their chins on you; they are giving you a hug :,)
I love Marbles. He is my absolute favorite ❤️
Jenna wanted to be tall, but she realized that’s impossible, so instead...

she got a tall dog
One day I want to be like you guys. 🌟🌟
yall are awesome doggie parents <3 bunny will get there, and you are definitely doing a great job dont let anybody tell you differently. <3
WHY WAS I BAWLING THIS WHOLE VIDEO 😭💜😭😭😭
I had a dream and in that dream I had an army of cermets, and their weapons were bars of Irish Spring soap
Jenna: Marbles this is your final step in life honey. It's the final step of your journey to befriend a big large dog.
Me: I'M NOT CRYING
You're good people. God bless you! Greetings from Texas 🇺🇸🇨🇱🙋🏼‍♀️
As someone who works in animal rescue, the way you guys handled her transition was just incredible. Like I wish more people where as invested as you guys where
thank you for giving her a forever loving home 💗
This is the type of family I want
She’s an exact mix of all the iggys 😭 she’s got peaches appearance, she’s a cry baby like cermit and she’s a solitaire like marbles
You are my favorite person of all time💛
You’re very insightful. I’m impressed with your new bigger family unit. ❤️
Wait, so where has this dog been kept prior to a foster home?  Was just stored somewhere for blood?  WHy is she so unfamiliar with everything?
Cant wait for the next up-date of Bunny 😍
Kermit:*cries in dog*
Bunny:*cries in dog*
Kermit: finally, a worthy adversary
18:03 OMFG Peach just chilling on the table XD XD
I AM CRYING AT THE STAIRS PART. THAT WAS SO CUTE AND DOMESTIC I’M 😭
You both are so kind,patient and loving to your dogs. I appreciate your dedication. We need more animal lovers.
COULD YOU GUYS IMAGINE IF JENNA AND JULIEN HAD AN ACTUAL HUMAN BABY OMG THEY WOULD BE THE BEST PARENTS EVER
Julian: Are you ready for this bud?
Marble: 👁👅👁
How ironic is it to name a Greyhound Bunny?
Also bunny reminds me of the fourth powerpuff girl
She is a full grown cermet
You treat your dogs with more respect than some adults do to their children. Major props to how much you care about your pets. I also learned a ton about like psychology!
*"Bounderies are okay
Being mean is not okay"*

Jenna you are such a great mom i cant im crying
So so cute when you helped her up the stairs!!!! Awwwww
Beautiful, thanks for sharing
I found this video so informative and wish I would have watched something like this before bringing our rescue into our home with our tiny tyrant of a min pin. Lol I think y’all are doing an awesome job! I’d love to keep seeing ways that you introduce her to “firsts” going in public places, dealing with guests for the first time, etc ❤️
“Maybe they’ll cry at each other and then create a dimension and go into it” 😂
Marbel:the first child whos now done with life ppl n everything... Desperately wants parents to family plan😂
Kermit:the wild child😂
Peachy:the surprise child🤐😅
Bunny:the golden child also will be done by sibling soon like marbels😂😂
Jenna and Julien just work so amazing together as a couple
This video is a terrific learning tool. you guys are doing fantastic.
okay i just started watching jenna's videos recently by recommendation from several friends and this video is just... absolutely amazing. i have been learning about dog behavior for the past few years and how jenna and julien treat their dogs is just.. so kind and so caring and i'm just amazed. so thankful they use their platform to spread all this wonderful dog positivity. <3
She don’t protecc

She don’t attacc 

But she does...think toy is snacc
I think she's beautiful and you guys are the perfect parents. You show so much love and affection, and you can just tell that she's in the best hands! Congratulations on your new pup!! 💗
Julien is such a dad.
This video made me cry a bit. It’s so sweet and so good. 💖
cry at each other and go into a dimension together LMAOOOO
She protecc
She attacc 
but most importantly
she whines bacc
Just wait till it’s Halloween and Christmas for Bunny
Holy shit I just finished watching that and realized it was 40 minutes long
Jenna: We are going to the long journey 
Me: Crying 😭
when marbles went to visit her in bed 😭 so sweet! i am in tears. Marbles is just so sweet & I love him!
Like i said in the past, and i will say again,
👏🏻This👏🏻is👏🏻the👏🏻conten👏🏻i👏🏻signed👏🏻up👏🏻for👏🏻
Sis said 🦘
I already loved Jenna and Julien so much, and I’ve gained even more respect for them(which I didn’t think was possible) after watching this video. The responsibility and kindness they had in going about this journey is amazing to see. Love them for everything that they do <3
Now you have to do a new roast my dogs!
Another dis is dis vid? I still watch and laugh at that vid
2 half grown cermets, 1 full grown cermet, and 1 Oreo with eyes
i love how jenna knows what to do and knows about proper dog care!
Why am I choking up when you said you were beside yourself 😩😭
Great dog adoption video. You showed so many  wonderful dog training techniques. Shared  a lot of good dog owner knowledge, so impressive! 
Hope we get a one year update. To enjoy the full picture. Love ❤️
You guys are amazing parents!
Bunny: timid
Kermit: nervous
Kermit: cries
Bunny: cries back

I think they are creating their own cry language.
So, I'm more of a cat person than a dog person but this video is so sweet it nearly made me cry. Also, I want a dog now!
Why have I only ever gotten chips ahoy adds from ur channel lollololol
From 6:37 how much does Jenna look like young Eminem ♥️
Aww, she’s so cute. I’m so glad you guys made the decision, Bunny’s precious 😊.
"Apologies for becoming a dog YouTube channel"

Please, I've been waiting for this.
Y tf did I keep reading this title as meet bunny or rescue greyhound 🤦🏻‍♀️😂 am I that stupid
Marbullz
Cement
Paesh
and BABIES
Helpful knowledge: I love her
They're not called 50Kmh couch potatoes for nothing. Bestest laziest good long boys and girls in the world
Sees pool:
BIG WATER BOWL HERE I COME
I'm actually crying. I love you guys so so much. She has such a wonderful home and such sweet parents and siblings. I know she'll grow into a happy, healthy dog because y'all are dedicated to her. I love Bunny with all my heart.
I really appreciate how real and honest you two are about the joys and challenges of this process.  I'm always way impressed with what awesome, responsible, knowledgeable dogs owners you guys are!  Congrats on your new pack member!!
18:38 cermets face scared me I am cry now
As a behaviourist, well done you’ve nailed it. I’m so happy she’s happy and I’m so happy you gave her the time she needed. You guys are perfect.
“Are you ready marble” marble:👁👅👁
Me this entire video: holding back tears
Jenna that's a deer, not a dog
(But fr she's so adorable and I love her and I cried way too much ;;)
Omg her snout is so long 😍
They probably brushed her teeth at the blood farm, because rotten teeth will make it non viable for animals with compromised immune systems
The stair process legit made me cry with how patient and loving they both are 😭 


AND THEN THE FARTING
This is amazing, what you're doing ! I read an article about greyhounds farmed for their blood in terrible, terrible conditions, it makes me sick and angry, I had no idea that kind of thing happened in a "rich" country. If this is what Bunny experienced, i understand why she is like that, poor thing. I love you guys, you are exceptionnaly brave people with big, big hearts
I literally dont have any dogs (i have cats) and i literally never plan to get one but watching your 40 minute dog videos are one of my favorite things
You guys are such good owners and care so much about them
Its inspiring! 
Love ya! ❤❤❤❤💕
I got my precious kitty Ivy the day before we went to New York and she was so small!!! When we came back her personality just sparked and she had grown so fast!!


(If you get in her face she will shower you in kisses)
I loved this! please update us soon :)
nobody:
absolutely nobody because we love everything jenna does:

jenna: apologizes
Jenna and juliens commitment to helping dogs is adorable 💛
Thanks for being Inspirational ! 
Happy Mother's Day Jenna !
What kind of dog is that? 13:01
long long life journey! ALL THE FEEEEEEELS!!
maybe kermit will stop crying now that he has a bigger kermit to feel the feelings with him
18:50 Kermit’s little tongue!! 😭❤️
Yay Bunny !!! 

I've got 3 dogs , Sooo....Never Apologize for becoming a dog YouTube channel,  lol. 

 Congratulations!
Thanks now I'm crying. Hope you have the best life journey with this beautiful soul.
3:05 marble is me waking up for school
NEVER apologize for becoming a dog channel. NEVER.
Literally the two most amazing dog parents I've ever seen. Bunny is gonna be so happy with you guys. She's so precious and sweet. So glad you guys are sharing your journey with her. Not only is it super fun for us to watch but it's also very helpful and informative for anyone else who wants to adopt a rescue dog. You guys are incredible! Welcome to the family Bunny!😊💖
You guys are seriously amazing! I just love how educated you are about everything, right down to the dogs meeting in a neutral space. It’s so good for others to see the correct way to adopt any dog! I am so happy for you guys because you truly care for your pets and treat them like family members. That’s exactly the way they should be treated. This dog is so lucky to have found you guys, so she can live a happy long life there. This reminds me of when I adopted my dog. She was in the pound and terrified in the back of the cage. She had gone through some horrible stuff, and she wasn’t even a year old yet! We knew it was going to be hard work, but I was willing to put that time in to give her happiness for the rest of her life. Now she’s running around, playful, and FULL of personality! Anyways, I’m excited for you guys! Congratulations!!
I’m so excited for y’all 💕💕💕
Jenna: talking to marbles about boundaries
Marbles: 👁👄👁
Also.. I think you guys are doing and did everything right by your new edition to your family. You waited, researched, bought things, addressed the appropriate issues. Like making your home ready, yourselves ready and your babies ready for a new family member. You guys are doing “Right” by her and Marbles, Kermit, & Peach. Wishing You Both All The Best!!!!
These videos always warm my heart. I love you two so much <3
You guys are just the best! I love this and am here for it!
I want to cry you guys are such good parents I love your family so much thank you for sharing with us!! Welcome to the family honey!!♡♡
when bunny cries “Awww honey it’s ok”
when Kermit cries “kErMiT sHuT uP”
That’s  soo cool my birthday  is on April 17
It’s amazing how much her behaviour changed just over the course of a week 💕
This is amazing - I can barely watch a 10 minute video without skipping through it but I watched this whole thing in one sitting. You and your dogs are amazing
I'm so happy I found your channel❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for loving these precious furry babies😘
“Maybe they’ll cry together, and create a dimension and like...go into it” 😂
Jenna, you are so sweet! It’s been great to watch this journey with you guys for years. Thank you for rescuing pups and letting them live their best lives!
Smooches! 
Tara
You are an amazing dog owner. If everyone approached dog ownership with as much compassion but also knowledge and understanding of the need for training etc, there would be far fewer dogs in need of rescue the world over.
This is the sweetest video... It crazy what a animal that dont speak, can't clean up after itself, and you pay everything for can have such a huge positive impact and great meaning to a person. Its one of the greatest qualities of humans.
I feel so bad I can see Bunny’s ribs I really hope you guys can get her properly fed and at a good weight soon 😊
it so cute when she sniffs the camera. she has a long boop.
on March 26, I lost everything to a house fire. watching this video made my next 3 months
You two are really great people! Bunny is going to have a wondeful, loving home.
Also dont't apologise for turning into a dog channel, dogs are great :D
Omg! I'm the 17th of april!!!!! Same birthday xx
She´s lovely!! I also think you´re handling her very well!
I NOW DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR CERMET IS FULL GROWN HAVE YOU BEEN WATERING HIM
My Heart♡ Both our dogs are rescues and I'm so proud of you for taking that journey. It's clear in all your precautions how much you love your pack and she is so lucky to join it
you should get a cat
This video is so beautiful, you both are so patient and great with your dogs, Bunny couldn’t have found better dog parents! Congrats on your new baby, I hope you all go on a wonderful life journey together! 💕
I think shes beautiful and you are doing great! I remember when it was just meebles!
Marbles; Small
Cermet: Medium
Paesh: Large
Bun: a b s o l u t e  u n i t
they're such good dog parents this is why i love them both 😂❤❤
Watching you two help her up the stairs nearly broke my heart.. you are wonderful dog parents <3
Kermit in the background 😂 (18:47)
Do a draw my life
“apologies for becoming a dog youtube channel”
you should NEVER apologize for that
I have a rescue iggy who was a street dog from Puerto Rico, she was the sweetest thing at the shelter before we brought her home we got her home and she was so different having to learn about food aggression and things like that in our already established pack, she is now the sweetest girl in our pack she thinks she’s head hancho but she’s not but 3 years later she’s a whole different dog you wouldn’t even know she’s a rescue! Awesome video love you guys shout out from Rochester NY!!! Can’t believe I have been watching you for over 9 years I remember when you got Kermit!!! Enjoy her guys!
I LOVE HER SO MUCH I CAANN'T
Also, my dog growing up LOVED her crate her whole life. She would just go in it on her own to chill haha, nothing wrong with crates :)
Bunny is like peach and Kermit mixed up but scared she’s soooo cute and calm❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love my saluki, more high maintenance than whippets, greys etc but I love the breed ❤️
"she cries everytime she smells kermit... she can smell his sadness" i bork laughed
No one:

Literally. Fr.  Like NO ONE:


Kermit: 
"So maybe...  They'll cry together and create a dimension and maybe go into it..  Idk" 😂
I love you two! Such great parents! Muah!
I think that this video is very educational
Edit - for someone getting or adopting a dog. I have 2 rescues myself
Kermit: Cries
Bunny: Cries back
Kermit: surprised pikachu meme
I'm dead at this. You guys are too incredible. And she is too freaking sweet.
Y'ALL HAVE HOME CROCS I'M DEAD. MY HUSBAND AND I THOUGHT WE WERE ALONE. CROCS ROCS
may be  a  RADIO  music   in the background  will help  ...to  relax.
I love the new direction of your channel. You were definitely led to this path. You both have a beautiful heart. 💕
Imagine how fast she’ll fly up & down those stairs when she’s comfortable
congrats on the new addition to the family! shes lucky she has a home with human parents as caring and patient as you guys.

p.s. Bunny is so cute and precious, aw. c:
Omg you 2❤️ my husband and I have rescue dogs and people that don’t just don’t get it..you’ve done a great job so far...well done, I’m proud of you both x
I come from a family of greyhound trainers, we absolutely adore the breed, they are the most loving, precious, sensitive and caring dogs that just need a companion! You have done so well bringing her into your family, nothing melts my heart more then seeing a grey get adopted into their forever homes. 

I hope she brings you all the love you desire!
The way I cried for 30 mins
Peesh: who r u 
Bunny: I am you but bigger
They look like ants compared to Bunny.
18:47 Kermit in the background😂
You’re so patient with her it’s heart warming 😭❤️❤️ such a beautiful lil baby
You should dress peach as iggy azalea ❤️😂
bunny: biggy
cermet and peach: iggy
marbles: sniggy
she's precious <3 you guys are the best dog parents. Congrats on your new baybeh!!
Great video Jenna!! You did an amazing job showing what it's actually like to adopt and adjust.
I swear that's XPLR march and im loving that she's wearing a hoodie and sweat pants of it
this is so incredibly amazing I'm sobbing. you guys rule.
“Boundaries are okay , but being mean is not okay” 

- Jenna Marbles 2019, 😀
Great words of wisdom
She takes care of this dog better than my parents ever took care of me. I'm already 18 but please Jenna, be my mom.
I just want everyone to know that i narrated this so much in the cearmet voice to my family 😂😂
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about you two taking in ANOTHER dog, but after watching the video it looks like I was worried for nothing. I think Bunny is going to be perfectly happy and comfortable with the other three, and I'm more than happy to give you the benefit of the doubt. Best of luck! <3
Bunny: Does absolutely nothing
Jenna: aaaawww good job honneyyyy.
You are doing a great job. Love from Texas
im so happy for you guys!!🙃❤️
I'm crying ya'll are so amazing
Can I just saw that Jenna has Marble's growling noise down perfectly. lol
"Apologies for becoming a dog youtube channel"


me: DONT APOLOGIZE MORE DOGS PLEASE
olive would sound so good
I'm more of a cat person honestly but i enjoyed this and the other Bunny video sooooo much nonetheless, it's heartwarming to see how caring and good you are and how she's slowly getting used to you :)
Everything you’re doing is so perfect and I love how you had them meet at the park! She has a really good home. I love that she is now a part of your happy family. So cute ❤️
The two of you are incredible dog parents.  Thank you for taking on a rescue dog.  From one rescue dog parent to another😃
Wow! Getting a dog together is such friendship goals
this made me cry it’s so cute i want a greyhound now
i love the patience you guys have
I love this video! My boyfriend and I will be adopting a retired greyhound after my rats pass (do NOT want those two species under the same roof) 
One thing I've noticed while shopping for items for the greyhound is finding a bed that's big enough, got a wall and will be comfy for lanky dogs, without costing me like £300 and/or bought from a dog racing business :( 
Where did you get the big blue bed? I'm in the UK so hopefully I can ship it because it looks perfect!
You are such amazing parents! Congratulations for your new addition to the pack !
Bunny looks like a giraffe compared to Peach and Kermit. A beautiful giraffe. Congrats on your new baby.
Eeeep how exciting!!! <3 
Also I know this is late but Happy Birthday Julian :D
I think you guys are doing Wonderful!
this is literally the cutest video on the internet
THIS CERMET HAD TOO MUCH WATER!
Bunny cries when Kermit cries?
He now has an emotional therapy dog
hi gorgeous girly💓 bunny boo
Why do you remind me of Megan McCarthy but a different voice
Ahh I love you guys. You guys, are doing everything perfectly. I know how hard it can be adoption a rescue dog. You guys are the best, keep up the good work. 😊👍
OH MY GOD I have the same birthday as Julien!!!
other youtubers: hey y’all coachella 2k19
jenna and julian: we got a new dog. we love her
you guys are amazing wow
I've super happy that you adopted a rescue doggy! I strongly suppory adopt-don't shop and seeing such a large channel doing it will influence other's, it is wonderful ♥
these are the best videos you've ever made
You guys are doing amazing by her. Nice to see people doing things properly and working so hard to save a life. <3 All this work will be 1000% worth it.
“I’m not gonna be filming, I’m not going to ask, I think it’s inappropriate”
This is one of the reasons I love Jenna
i just cried for like 15 minutes thanks
Your pack is pretty awesome
I think you’re doing a great job!!
This is just the best video ever I rly cried when y'all helped her get up stairs
"maybe, they'll both cry at each other, create a dimension, and both go into it" LMAOOO
I love you guys and I’ve been watching for years but this episode is the one that finally got me to subscribe! All the love is a beautiful relief. Congrats on the new pack addition!
The amount of care you took throughout the entire process to make sure she was as comfortable as possible, that the iggys were as comfortable as possible was so wonderful to watch. You both have hearts of gold and she's lucky to have y'all as parents.
I have whippets.
Two of them and
Their names are Zoe and Zac.
Peach and Kermit look like her babies 💗
apologies for becoming a dog YouTube channel

7:56 should've been the thumbnail
Wow you guys are amazing. This was so beautiful. I appreciate you guys for being such great doggy parents. You guys look beautiful.
Marble knows boundaries of other life forms but doesn’t know how to sit on the hardwood floor.
This video makes me feel so good...just everything is good 😊
u r such a genuine person... love ur channel!
Your puppies are so adorable❤️
Omg my sis got the same birthday
Aww bunny so cute
Every mom/dad on YouTube: LOoK aT mY NeW BaAAbY! 

Jenna Marbles: This is my new dog, please understand that she is a living, breathing creature and has her own set boundaries.
Why does she have to wear a muzzle
I love y'all. It's a beautiful thing. It is a lot but it's worth it. Beautiful pup 💛 as a pup owner myself/ adoptive dog parent it can be difficult I also am doing it myself, just me. I'm a dog Mom and I love it.
You guys are the epitome of calm assertive energy no anger nothing just calmness and Bunnys lovely energy is a result of that. Your doing such a great dog and in only the first couple of weeks amazing.
I paused this after the comment of her not being aware of ball noises (that's what she said...um) getting distracted, anyway.... please use extreme caution using the drone to film around her. I had a bad feeling, premonition, whatever you call it. Ps lots of love to the new family🖤🖤🖤
Marble is literally the size of her head I'm crying
This is honestly one of the most wholesome videos. Why am I crying in the club rn
How sweet it would be to call her - Easter.)
ok sooo i love this video and also love Bunny! she's great :) i also enjoyed the length of the video! now when can we expect a "comedy" style video this length :D pretty pretty please and thank you!  Welcome Bunny!
Omfg so precious💜💜
“Apologies for becoming a dog youtube channel” this exactly the kind of content I signed up for
This was so wholesome. My heart is full of joy
I never noticed how small the iggys were until the new dog looked like a GIANT next to them. Lmao!
This was an awesome vudeo to watch.  I had a rescue spaniel/pampillon that my parents had for a year but other dogs wouldnt let him eat so they asked if he could stay with me.  He was so skittish that I had to have a leash on him for the first 2 weeks to even get close enough to him to let him outside.  When he got comfy enough he showed me a trick of doing a little dance.  He only did it for me.  Seeing how you can improve a life like that. . . it's phenomenal.  Thank you for sharing.
There's honestly not a better dog mother on this planet.  Bunny won the dog lottery on this one
Lucky lucky dog, you guys are amazing 💗
ur so good with ur dogs and always are doing what's best for them I love it<3
MY BIRTHDAY IS THE 18TH OF APRIL!!!! #ARIESCLAN OMG JULIAN?!!!
Yay you guys! Awesome dog parents 💕 love that you are taking it slow and at her pace!
old man
nasty boi
mango
nervous horse

love them all, what a great addition to the pack 💛
27:42 julien gets a discord notification lol
OMG my bday is 17 of april
My reaction to first view of Bunny in car: My god that's an actual Greyhound, and not an Italian Greyhound. B I G D O G
the first month is the hardest.  it takes time, but soon she’ll be one of the pack
Bunny truly won the jackpot for owners!  You guys are doing amazing!
34:29 keep the vid paused, Julian your face lol 😂
julien cut her off😂😂 "i mean we could go on and on she's a great dog"
3:35 ME😂 when I got my puppy I cried
You guys are so loving. She is lucky to have you. I know she will thrive soon
I love how bunny is just an enlarged spotted version of peach
i cannot belive they got peach 5 years ago, dang ive been watching youtube for too long the years are flying by
this is so pure and i wanna cry. you guys are such good parents to all of them!
congratulations on the new precious addition to your family♥
Personally I wouldn't have any dogs on the bed or couch
Best doggie parents ever! Auhhww! I felt so much compassion from them, it was beautiful to hear how connected and attuned they are to their doggies' needs. Safety, boundaries, love and respect ❤
Maybe Bunny can help teach Jenna how to be tall
The moments of healing and rest comment 😭😭 shes seems so grateful and feels safe to sleep by you!
finaly cermet isnt the midel chield anymore but is he going to grow?
You're such great doggy parents! You're doing an amazing job!
this reminds me so much of rescuing my youngest dog who was very timid at first, potentially suffered past abuse, and having to get him used to our household with a much more confident dog!! it's the most rewarding process <3
"When we do go in her foster home, i'm not going to film I don't want to ask i think its inappropriate" mad respect
I love you guys! Literally made me cry too! You both are awesome doggie parents!! 💓🐾 We have 11 dogs and oh boy is it a lot of work but I love all my fur-babies. Rescues are amazing! You guys a doing a great job! 🐾
I cant wait to watch videos of you guys finally with children
Bunny is now in the most capable and loving hands she could ever be.
The dogs chilling in the car before the park was the most adorable thing!!!!
“Im not gonna ask to film it’s inappropriate” highest rank queen!!! love you for that
That poor baby :( she is so precious. She will see she's in a great home now.
I’ve had 5 greyhounds in the past, it is very very common for them to become attached to their crate, they are such sweet lazy beings 💕
You guys always make the most wholesome videos and are great examples on family <3 Welcome to your beautiful girl and I wish you all the happiness and love. You are an amazing dog mom, and ofc Julien is a great dog dad!
I am so glad they are getting adopted. I live in a state where they did have racing I am so happy they shut it down.  Greyhounds are so so sweet. You made a good decision.
Jenna’s channel has become a dog YouTube channel

Julien’s has become a cooking channel

My life is complete
You guys are doing great! Congratulations on the new addition to your family. I look forward to the one video in the future where they’re all piled up together lol
I still can't get over how Julien looks at Jenna when she's talking. 😩
18:10 i dont watch him, but that shroud?
THIS IS SO PURE OH MY GOD I ACTUALLY CRIED
I wonder which thing would Score better on an Intelligence test …. Marbles or a Cockroach ?
I can't wait to know what her favourite soap is
You guys are furbaby goals
Greyhound mom here!🙋🏼 i stopped myself from crying when you were so sweet w her on the stairs. 💕 greys are kinda worry warts!! She's a beauty - looks like my Justice!!
oh m y god her nose is so long it's actually funny
A video from the Cermit P.O.V...
"Apologise for becoming a dog youtube channel" 
You have absolutely nothing to apologise for
you're such great dog parents!!!
Good job y’all! ❤️❤️ this makes me so happy
I look up to you both as pet parents. You are doing such a wonderful job. I'm so happy for you guys! I have been watching you since you got Marbles, and you have always put their growth and needs on par with your own. ♡♡♡♡♡
You  look like you are gently burgling Bunny on the stairs.
Jenna: "No don't drink thatt!"
Bunny: But am thorsty
J: "that's pool water"
B: wamt drink am drink pool
22:38 how adorable🤗
That Miniso bear though 😊😂
Future video: the smol squad plays with a beach ball, while Bunny naps and watches from her pool chair,  and this little family takes all the time it needs.
She has such kind, loving eyes. I recognized them immediately. My dog has the same. ❤
No one: 
Not a soul:
Jenna: gOod GiIiiRL
This is so sweet. Greyhounds are the best most gentle giants in the world. 
But my grey still can't be unsupervised with stuffy toys - he eats them too!
That stair scene brought back a lot of memories! Haha!
I cried I love her so much omg
This made me tear up, i love how engaged you are in this and it's really really beautiful to see you give so much love to bunny <3
I'm so glad you guys rescued!! Its definitely not easy but so very rewarding!
Peachy aged Marbles the way the presidency aged Obama
I love all of this. Really a great example of safely introducing a new dog. As a dog mom I thought this was beautifully and responsibly done.
Never apologise for becoming a dog channel - WE LOVE IT! :D
One of my dogs started crying after hearing Bunny, my other one barked 😂
she protecc
she attacc
but most importantly
she now part of a pacc
3:36 kermit watcha doing back there
congrats on ur highly protected new addition wonderful animals.
marble looks like he's decomposing in the intro
You two are so patient and so gentle and loving, and the little dogs were so friendly and welcoming, I just wanna cry. <3
Cermet: sad nasty boy
Peach: jump and fast
Marbles: old and tongue
Bunny: timid and pool
Hi - I just discovered you this evening quite by accident and so glad I did.  I have fostered rescue dogs for over 18 years and the shy/scared/timid dogs do very well with me and my routine.  I adopted a retired racer four years ago and he adjusted well but it took time.  He had never seen stairs, doors, or lived in a house so everything was new to him. He still will get freaked out over small things but for the most part, and easy dog to have around (he sleeps most of the time). I am no expert but I will say I think you are doing everything the right way - going slowly and reading when she gets upset.  Thank you so much for understanding dog behavior.  She's a lucky girl to be with you.  Ignore all the comments and do what you know is right and take advice from the group / former foster dad.  Can't wait to watch how she adapts...and she will.  Poor thing....I hate the way they are exploited.
Wait, you got Peach five years ago? FIVE?? Where does the time go! I thought she was two at most!
14:57 I don’t know why i find him walking in so funny😂😂😂
Im in tears this was the perfect video
Paesh: sees Bunny
Paesh: I want to be tall
Can I kindly ask what muzzle you use?
Teach bunny how to swim!!!
wait are you actually gonna keep her?
Marble is even tinier now in comparison like I can't even see him anymore???
STOP BEING SUCH A GOOD ROLE MODEL
Jack's dogs are still better tho..
I cried lol omg so sweet
7:56 sorry that was just the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
everyone else's goal: buy a house
Jenna & Julien's goal: buy a house TO ADOPT A GREYHOUND
i love them.
Towards the end Julien is like take a breath Jenna 😂 too many words 😂 I love the whole family❤️
I personally bloody love this. I have a rescued retired greyhound who I've had for a while now, my boy Sherman,  so seeing this video makes my heart so happy. greyhounds are the best, changed my life completely 💗 so crazy to see you guys grow to have a large dog! I've always had bugger dogs,  German Shepherd, golden retriever, Kelpie and a greyhound, but to see you guys have a big girl too makes me so happy, congrats guys ❤
Literally the best dog parents ever
Dude that cermet followed all the steps!
Two words: 
B     I     G
P     E   A    C    H
These are prime examples of dog people.
(Also this is a wholesome video)
I feel that you and Julien should start a series about dog training. Y’all seem to be so damn good at it.
as someone experienced in greyhounds im SO HAPPY to see you doing this and bringing these beautiful dogs to the public eye!!! im also glad you're helping to speak about crate training and muzzling your greyhound, it can make them so much more comfortable and keep them from feeling anxious.
Damn I cried I miss my dogs so much Finals are getting to me
Prediction: Bunny will become Kermit's own emotional support dog.
sometimes I forget Jenna has a psychology degree
Thank you for making this, not just for us to see but for people to understand what it takes into adopting a dog, especially a greyhound and especially into a home with dogs already there. I feel like the world doesn’t understand how much goes into caring for them sometimes.
And congrats c: 
It’s on my bucket list to rescue one.
You guys are literally the most loving dog parents ever. I am so happy for you and bunny. What a perfect match.
Marbles tongue sticking out at 3:10 😂😂
I have to take a moment to say....THANK YOU FOR ADOPTING THAT BEAUTIFUL BABY! The love you have for all your furry kiddo's is amazing! The 2 of you should advocate for those who have no voice. Its so obvious how much love you have to give :) So again, thank you for taking the time to make me laugh and even cry (in a good way)
I think it’s funny how much tinier marble looks now
you both are amazing humans and I love you so much
What a beautiful dog! She‘s so lucky to be adopted by Jenna and Julien. She’s going to have an amazing life full of love from now on 🥰
She’s so beautiful!
How good you are with her (and all your dogs), the amount of effort and research you put into this made me emotional.  You are being so kind and responsible. It makes me so happy to know that Bunny's life is forever changed and will be forever loved.  I don't know why I'm crying. Something's wrong with me 😂
“It was our goal in 2019 to adopt a greyhound”
Ok but how much taller are you tho
I'm gonna be honest. Looking at the thumbnail, I honestly thought it was a picture of a doe.
The first frame Weavch is going crazy
Good for yall❤️ I adopted a golden retriever mix that was stuffed in the mail slot of the pound we got her from. She was underweight, scared. She had been abused and everything scared her. It took years for her to understand the world but,a few days ago was her 11th birthday and she’s the best decision we have ever made. Congratulations on your new addition 🐶❤️💕
When the time comes, I know she will become a great mother
Jenna: marble you ready to meant your new sister!
Marble:  ^           ^
             👁 👅👁
HOW COULD ANYTHING ABOUT HOW YOU'RE BRINGING HER INTO THE FAMILY BE DISAGREED WITH?? Me - a non dog owner, who plans on having dogs, would have slammed them all together. Thank you for this beautiful teaching moment!
She has the most perfect home/ owners!
You have a platypus bear pillow too! I sleep with mine every night. 😍
Hey Jenna ive been watching your channel since 2012  (7 years!!!) and this made me cry, i was so happy with how you  did this, bunny is at the best place she could ever be!! best wishes to you and your expanding fur baby family
The internet: you getting married?! You having a baby?!
Jenna: Im getting another dog!!!
My hero❤
My best friends birthday is apr.19
Literally looks like a skinny cow
I legit started crying at the stairs part cause you guys are so caring!!! AWWW!!! You're amazing dog parents
I feel like we need weekly updates included in videos now 👀
Small boi 
Nasty boi
Smart girl 
New addition: 
Long girl
Your yard looks so nice 😍😍
Just wanted to say that's its awesome that you guys adopted!
I've had an adult Italian-greyhound mix rescue, who has similar tendencies - nervous and timid - for about a year and a half. He is still scared of my air conditioner! So although he is doing much better, he requires adjustments that not every dog would need. Best of luck and looking forward to seeing more of your new baby! :)
why does bunny have a muzzle? btw shes so cute <3
“Peach 2 - The Streets” 😂
I can feel Julien holding back all that Aries energy
I cried through the whole video.  You guys are awesome.
loved this video <3
Bunny is beautiful. Not gonna lie Ik a lot of people have said it but I did for real think bunny was a dear lol 🐶🦌
Absolutely do NOT apologize for the dog content, this video was so beautiful and special😭💗
Please adopt me🐕
What a beautiful doggie...not that the other ones aren't. And J&J are great dog parents. 💞💖💕
You're so good and patient with your dogs - it warms my heart that they have such a good home :)
Aaaayyyyy I have the same birthday as Jillian 🎉🎉🎂🎂
Idk about anyone else but I’m excited for a Bunny/Kerm crying compilation 😂😂
The field of view is higher than my hairline
Honestly I love this video. I can tell just how much you love and adore all of your dogs, and how important they are to you, and how much you really do care about their well-being. You guys have a great family.
Awww cute dog your doing great my pup does that with the couches she will scratch at it until she feels comfy.

Peach THE SMARTEST
Marbles THE LAZIEST
Bunny THE BIGGEST
I just adopted a retired racer a week ago. The BEST decision I have ever made! She brings so much love and joy! Enjoy your new baby <3
I had seen this video like 100000 times already
You guys are doing amazing I’m so proud of you guys
Y’all lucky that you have no more school
Other Youtubers: “Just bought another Ferrari and a Gucci bag.”

Jenna and Julien: “We got another dog.”
Greyhounds are the best! I adopted a large timid greyhound and it has been a magical journey.
Congrats on your new baby! I rescued my greyhound, Mac, over a year ago. Mine still won't do stairs. He's a retired racer. It might help if you find a greyhound play group to help socialize her. I attend a greyhound group playdate once a month just to keep him socialized with his own breed. She will probably be much more comfortable around dogs she's used to. You're both doing an excellent job! Keep reaching out to your adoption agency, they're a great resource! Good luck guys!
Just me who loved this type of video from Jenna ?
How sweet, congrats!! You guys should order from Chewy.com, SO much cheaper then the pet stores. And it shows up at your door!! :)
"apologies for becoming a dog channel" are you kidding these are my favourite videos
Woah! She makes peach look like a chihuahua
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen.
OMG I have 2 ex racing greyhounds
Best pet parents everrrr 💜 so considerate and caring!
“peachy youre not the baby anymore!” 
peach: is grawn waman
I totally get it. I have 2 rescue dogs. One of them I adopted fairly recently from an abusive home and because of that he has a lot of fear when it comes to meeting  strangers and gets overwhelmed easily when out in public. I'm so happy for you and bunny and know shes gonna have the absolute best life you can give her. ❤
Jenna, you are by far the best dog owner I know of <3 don't listen to the haters
I just got a greyhound! They're so cute!
I work with horses, and she seems like the horse version of a dog lol, just in how she's timid and how she reacts to things. (Not bad things btw) So much different from my crazy dog haha
I’m glad she’s getting use to the sounds of basketball maybe she can go to your basketball game tomorrow! 🏀
I rescue a lot of dogs and I just wanna say you are an amazing human!! You understand the process and I love you for that!
It's Wednesday my dudes
I was thinking that if she was gonna be another fruit thing maybe it would be mango or peaches and cream? Or pumpkin cause she’s so sweet!
As a person who rescues animals this warms my heart so much. Greyhounds are used in terrible experiments and like you said for their blood. I've trained many animals and you are doing such a good job by being patient with her. <3 You are such good people. <3
"so maybe they'll cry together and create a dimension and both go into it" 

I felt that 😂
I absolutely love her!!!
Have fun on your vacation baby❤️
After hearing about janelle’s incident (teen mom) edit: her husband shot and killed their family dog a Boston terrier, because he “constantly” would bite their daughter. Mind you they never corrected that behavior 
I wish everyone had your mindset about having to learn a dog’s behavior and understanding it..
I love you both ❤️
Another vine reference I LOVE IT
Day one of having a dog: you’re doing great sweetie 

Year five of having a dog: 18:24 “peach honestly what the hell”
So I have your exact new dog except add some beagle. It's taken her about a year to learn how to dog properly. 😂
She doesn't have a name at this point in the video, and I know that greyhounds are "supposed" to be super super skinny, but I just want to get her all chunky!! Oh God she is so cute!! 😍😍
I’m bawling 😭 ❤️
the discord notification noise got me
never apologize for becoming a dog YouTube channel
I can't wait for them to have a fun vacation 😂
She's so cute!!!! Also love marble so much lol 🖤
She reminds me of my old dog queen. Queen was really timid too
You two are FANTASTIC pet parents. It honestly bugs me when people try to police your methods.
iggys: what are you
bunny: am you but longer
marbles: :P
I had 2 Greyhounds. Both has minor skin issues (basically acne on the hairless spots) just keep an eye out. And as for commands....Sit, potty, walk, ride, and food. That's it.....come, stop,....no matter how much we trained...nope! All they wanted to do was run. And hunt furry things....including small dogs. So off leash times where "solo", and fenced in, with them. On leash they where fine.
Okay I have had a greyhound for the last 9 years (he is now 13) and here are a few semi-pro tips for you. She needs a bigger bed because they do not know how to lay correctly. She will want to sprawl. I would recommend a large rectangular memory foam bed with multiple washable covers. They will try to scratch/tunnel their way through anything so we ended up spending about $500 for ours with two slip covers and two water proof pads. Its worth it. After like 5 slumber balls beforehand, it is completely worth the amount we had to spend to make this bed last the last 5 years. Also, greyhounds are so bad at stairs. Ours never learned it and actually it was a positive thing because the cats have their own little sanctuary to get away from him without us having to put up gates. Lastly, which I'm sure you know by now, you will be able to hear her do everything. They are LOUD criers and will make sure they are heard no matter what.

Enjoy your long life journey <3
You’re the sweetest human oml
Your videos of Bunny really takes me back to when I adopted my Angie (retired racer). I remember (and had almost forgotten) that she used to resource guard bones.  It scared me the first time she growled at me. I didn't have small dogs but I had 2 cats who walked all over the place.  And worried if they got too close that she may snap at them.  I trained her the exact same way you did, with trading up and muzzling her.  In retrospect, it really didn't take long for her to get it. I've had her now 8 years and barely remember those days. She was nervous too. And I remember the first time she wagged her tail.  Your videos reminded of these things.  I can report now 8 years later, that she has been a near perfect dog.  She's extremely affectionate, sweet and gentle. She is always so happy loves life and everyone she meets. Because Angie was/is so perfect, I adopted another rescue 3 years ago. My second is Laila and she's a galgo which is a Spanish greyhound. They are incredibly sweet together.   I'm excited to follow Poppy's story as watching her is really reminding of how far Angie has come.
she protecc
she cry bacc
but most importantly
she one of the pacc
Bunny is a giant version of Peach
Best thing we ever did was adopt a retired racer ❤️
20:51 me starting to cry
Kermit: high tenor crying
Bunny: deep alto crying


Beautiful.
You guys are the best you guys are so patient and loving and your doing so well and anyone who wants to about how they think that you should be doing they can really back up
Oh my goodness, this is the sweetest thing ever!
Bunny is an grown cermet.
I JUST REALIZED THEY NAMED HER BUNNY BC THEY GOT HER AROUND EASTER OMG 😭
Adopting a greyhound is a lot of work...they have PTSD and no knowledge of things outside of the track and a cage. Stairs, glass doors, and even barking need to be taught. But adopting them gives them the life they deserve. So happy yall chose to adopt a greyhound!
3:05 tf?
Make sure you water ur cermit so he will graow as big as bunnay.
U should name her kiwi 😭
It took a solid 2 years for my Boy Dean to accept and trust me, He had a really bad start at life as a bait dog. He is now a happy healthy slobbery boy. it takes time but It's so so worth it to see how much he has changed
YOU CANT INTRODUMCE MARBLES HES DEAD
You INSENSITIVE Oof
the new one is giant (4 cermits) and has an awful pattern + colour. I'm shocked! Looks like an American staffordshire meets a cow. Why do not rescue a chihuahua ... then it becomes 2:2. Seems completely imbalanced now
Jenna cries about getting Bunny 

A few years later

Jenna: 
DOGGY   L O N G
we just got a puppy, our older dog is 10(and is the puppy’s bio father). taking it slow is key. you two did amazing and were so patient in this video. my puppy is very timid, but after a half an hour begins to show normal puppy behavior. just give it time. the growling is perfectly normal. my older dog has snapped on the puppy several times and has been on top of the puppy barking. eventually they will get used to each other. keep working with them:) love you two💓
PLEASE DO A VIDEO WHERE YOU MAKE PEOPLE OUT OF FOOD
I rescue sharp peis and I adopted one lil girl that was severely abused and it took us a year to get her adjusted with us and adjusted to our other dogs and she is doing so well but we still have to be cautious mainly around small children but that is what you do when your a dog parent you just have to set up boundaries and know your dogs limitations 😊💕💜
2 small horses orbit a much larger horse while marble watches from afar
She reminds me so much of my rescue dog Nala, my husband found her in a field in an area where a lot of dog fighting happens and dogs are dumped, we took her to the vet to find she was perfectly healthy, and we brought her home to our 3 other dogs and it was tough, she sat in my lap the first 3 days basically, and finally
It was my dogs that helped her open up to be the amazing dog that she is, so I wouldn’t be surprised that, your dogs will be so helpful and part of the key in the process of her finding out she’s in a good place.
Good luck on your new journey, she is beautiful and you guys are the perfect people to have a rescue dog, so I’m incredibly excited to see this!! Sending so much love and good vibes!

What a beautiful family of small deer you have
19:14 when Kermit glitches out of existence
we had to put my sweet boy rusty down a few days ago, he was an old man on his last days. watching ur dog videos gives me so much comfort so don’t apologize for being a dog channel !!
She protec 
She attac

But most importantly 
YoU cAnT DrInk tHaT
she’s gorgeous, just needs some more muscle
i wonder if she hates tv because of the monitors from where she got her blood drawn, maybe she associates it with that??
couples who wear crocs together, stay together
i love the way marble listens. My chihuahua taya is about the same age and acts just like him lol
I've never realized just how tiny all of your dogs are
The fact y'all used a basket muzzle filled me with joy. 
YES they look scary, YES they have a blocky appearance but they are a million times better than the muzzles that are form fitting to the dogs muzzle. 
Muzzles like that prevent the dog from eating, drinking and panting. Which is a VITAL thing for dogs that are being exercised because it is the only way they can cool off. 
Dogs don't sweat so they rely on panting to cool down their internal temperature and when they cannot do that they are at an extreme risk for a heat stroke. Basket muzzles provide a safe barrier but also allow the dog to do pretty much everything a restrictive one cant. pant, drink and even eat treats (that are handed to them) etc! Overall if your dog is prone to nervousness or aggression i'd HIGHLY recommend a  basket muzzle.
I know you said she was a blood donor dog, but I'm still curious if you know what her life was like before you met her.  I've never heard of a blood donor dog.  Was she like, a lab rat just kept in a cage?  Truly though, that sweet doggy is very lucky to have a loving family like yours.  Hooray!
I truly admire how much time and effort you guys are putting into bringing this dog into your home. It’s so nice to see such caring people take rescues in and in such an open and understanding way. You guys are awesome
You guys are doing an amazing thing xx
She protecc
She attacc 
but most importantly
she whines bacc
its aries season *stix out tung*
ME AND JULIAN HAVE THE SAME BDAY
Me and my family adopted a greyhound called Eddie but we changed it to Edward and his racing name was Jimmytheweed
TV screen probably looks like the monitor at the blood draw place
They called her Peach 2 but missed this opportunity....


JULIEN AND THE GIANT PEACH
poor thing i bet she hasn’t been able to sleep whenever she wants her whole life. you guys are so awesome, the perfect rescue parents!!
I waited to watch this b/c I knew it would make me emotional, the moment I saw her I cried. shes beautiful and yall are amazing dog parents. now she has sisters and a family and its so sweet
That nose though!!!! Oh my goodness!!!! She's adorable.  I don't typically think greyhounds are cute, but she's absolutely adorable.  She's almost kind of dorky looking like Mr. Cermet. Lol.
jenna good info thank you for educating all of us.
I love seeing videos about dogs! I am so excited to see her grow and get comfortable I love dogs!
April 17th is my sister’s birthday
She protecc

Kermit and Bunny are the middle children club.
PEACH II: THE FRUITENING

She seems so sweet omg and she adjusted so well
yayyy thank you rescuing!!!!
but the real question is, will she be interested in Irish Spring?
Best pet parents 😭
8:35 is love if it could be shown in a video
I felt like i shouldn't be watching this video because it's like a therapy log, but the client's a dog.
You two are awesome pet owners. I’m dealing with my boy I’ve had for 3 years. He’s terrified of everything including the visual on TV. So I’d love to know how you guys are going to manage and work on that
Why do I feel so sad when Jenna told marble "this is the final step of your journey" 😥 it's like... it hits me how old marble is.
THANK YOU for showing how difficult but rewarding, rescuing a dog into an already established pack is. Soo many people think it'll be easy, and then when it doesn't work right away, they return them or take them to a shelter. It is difficult and it does take work. But it's one of the most rewarding things in life.
OH HELL YEAH!!!! Kermit finally has a nervous friend to cry with!




Thanks for a billion trillion likes!!!!!!!
you're so wise...and even though i don't have dogs of my own i'm learning so much through you :)
Take as long as you (and Bunny) need to be comfortable with videos. As someone who grew up with a rescue (dad's friend brought him from a very abusive home), it takes time for them to be okay with things. Sometimes they're NEVER okay with things (our boy panicked on our hardwood floors bc inside time was abuse time), but that's okay too. What really matters is that you and Bunny are happy. Videos aren't even in the running here.
I am so soft
22:38 melts my heart
Omg . "Marbles you wanna meet her?"
THE LITTLE TAIL WAG AND FACE
Our dog loves to play with Kong toys.
this brings me back to when i adopted my cats ooof
I♥️♥️dogs vere much
You guys are awesome💕
Bunny is Kermit's crying partner, Peach's girl time partner, and Marble's body guard lol.
This video had no business making me cry this much
Didn’t realize mr marbles’ tongue was this long 😳 6:09
We got our rescue dog 2 weeks before we were going on holiday for 2 weeks... She stayed with my grandparents and loved every second of her holiday 😂
Welcome to real dog hours
No more of these dead or potatoes dogs
im so happy julien finally let you get your cat
Банни очень милая собака. Удачи в ваших начинаниях💖💜💙
i didnt watch jenna in a long time and marbles is still alive yay
I remember when you got Marbles & Kermit. I can’t believe it’s already been 5 years you’ve had Peach! Bunny is very lucky to have you ❤️
why does bunny wear so many collars?
Peach - has a hard time opening eggs
Kermit- has a hard time finding eggs 
Marble- has a hard time
“if you had a big dog....” and now they have Bunny 🤧😭😭🥰
Jenna: look marbles an egg
Marbles:👁👄👁
Jenna: GOOD JOB YOU DID IT ALL ON YOUR OWN
Nobody:
Jenna: tHE EASTER BILBY GETS A KNIFE
I wonder if their neighbors anxiously await the release of each new video for some explanation of that week's fuckery.
I love how the video before they  got Bunny they dressed up as bunnies 😂 such foreshadowing
Me: Depressed and sad...

Jenna: I dress up and throw my dogs a Easter egg hunt. 

Me: 
"His will to survive is being stifled by blades of grass" 




okay true
"i go to place where food was before, maybe food spawn again" --me going to the kitchen and looking in the cabinets forlornly, knowing full well i already ate all the snacks i'm looking for
I love how she had to tell Julien to hide the eggs at dog height bc he literally would’ve thrown them over the fence and put them in trees
Alright it's final: 

I'd die for marble. He's too pure.

*also, Peach is a genius
realizes the Easter Bunny from Rise of the Guardians is Australian

h u h
Marble- you find them, open them, and I eat the treats
Kermit- You find, I open, and eat the treats
Peach- I find them, open them, and eat the treats





Marble+Kermit= Peach
Who else is rewatching this video in preparation for tomorrow's bunny video???? So excited!!!!!!
Marbles: cant move
Cermet: whines
Peachy: jumps onto very high table
4:14 me waiting for Jenna's new video called "introducing my new giant dog to my midget children"
“Sometimes I read Wikipedia and I don’t know what’s going on” 
Me in a nutshell
Jenna:If YoU hAd A bIg DoG tHiS iS fUn!


Next day:”gets big dog” WOW
kermit being mad watching peach is the funniest thing ever
Julien: "she does everything so precious"
Peach: falls ass first into camera
omg imagine if peach was bunny sized LMAO she would be sooo naughty!
Peach jumps on the island 
Julian: she’s so polite 
😂🤦🏼‍♀️
This was w/o a doubt the sweetest most wonderful video I've ever seen,  Now I know why you have nearly 20 million loyal viewers.....subbed.  Thank you both for the cozi feelings.
Jenna-OMG ARE YOU serious
Still Jenna -IM TELLING YOUR DAD IM TELLING YOUR DAD
jenna’s channel has turned into domestic bliss and i’m here for it
"oh God he's eating leaves!" 😂😂😂 I don't know why that was so funny but I'm crying 🤣
I'm not a 32 year old lady setting up an Easter egg hunt for her dogs, but I am a 24 year old woman completely redesigning her guest room to be a paradise for her cats, so...
1:35 my sleep paralysis demon waking me up on Easter morning
You guys have to redo this whole video again now that Bunny is here🐰🥰
ok so peach is definitely the one you guys send to college
I sometimes hide my rabbit’s food around the room so sometimes when he really wants to eat he goes around checking all the places I hid the food last time, it’s so cute
Maybe next year they can do this with Bunny, too!!! I hope she's getting more comfortable 🐰💗
so excited to see this next year with your xtra large cermet
This is literally marbles mood 25/8: 

      👁👄👁
Marble: shows any sign of life.
Jenna: Good boy marbles, you did it.
Peach: jumps on table
Jenna: “HEEYOOOMYGOD—!”
Peach:jumps on counter 
Jenna:I TELLN YA DAD
I wish Bunny was around in time to participate with the family as well
WHO IS HERE WAITING FOR JENNA TO POST ABOUT BUNNY! 


MEEEEEEEEE
kermit: good opening skills
peach: good instincts
marble: good morning!
Were those long distance shots of Julien in the backyard directed by David Fincher? Truly the unsettling thing I've ever seen 🤣
13:38 HAHAH Julien laughing at Kermit's misery is me with my bro
I am norwegian and I can confirm your skiing theory.
The way Jenna says "Waow" to Marbel finding the egg's, is the way I say "Wow" to my exams. 😂
🐶 Strategies:

🍑 use brainz 
🐸 use nasty
👁👅👁 am cute, help.
at 0:46 it looks like peach is on fire in the background 😂
wait a minute!!! the chalk on the ground says ARIES SZN
"if you had a big dog..."


foreshadowing intensifies
“cAn NoT See pINk 
Do nOt KnoW wHaT Is”
Peachy is that girl who is smart, athletic, social, pretty and basically good at everything so you get jealous but can't hate her because she is actually a really good person too
Just here because I have 0 patience for waiting to see Jenna and Julien’s new Bunny so I’m just going to trick myself with this Easter video with them dressed as bunnies 😂 will it work? 
Probably not but whatever!
9:20 “If you had a big dog, this would be so much fun”

Foreshadowing?? 😂 I’m so excited to have Bunny be an official member of the family
jenna: what do you think?
julian: i think marble is gonna SUCK

he was right, hahah 😂
Peach- The Brains
Kermit- The Muscle
Marbles- The ???, well, he's a cute old man.
Jenna:  * Directly gives the egg to Marbles *

Also Jenna: good job! You're so smart! 💖

That's the kinda encouragement I need in my life 🙏
“Sea biscuit is INCHES away » had me crying 😂
Marbles: Borderline
Kermit: Average
Peach: Gifted
Congratulations on the new.pack member! Bunny is so much bigger than the iggys, and I honestly can't believe Peachy's going to get a new sister
i love that they made an Easter themed video and then they got BUNNY <3 <3
nobody:
marble:👁👅👁
jenna: awwww mabbbbleew
I'm cry laughing at the:
Jenna: "It's like taking candy from a baby!"
Julian: "She made him look like a fooool."
😂😂😂
"Its a good thing your head is shaped like a bicycle seat." 

I've never heard a more accurate description of a sighthounds head. Sheer perfection.
I'm from Australia and I have honestly never heard of the easter bilby instead of the easter bunny😂
peach: wow i’m too smart for this ...
kermit: 👁    👁
             💧👄💧

marble: 👁👄👁
i love how they both wear crocs and they match their outfit.
julien- dark easter bilby that murders children
jenna- nice happy cute easter bunny
2:36 Julian in the background in that outfit looks like a horror movie
That was actually pretty dang fun. Peach is beast.
I love that this is low key a psych experiment with Italian greyhounds
No one:

Jenna: ThE eAsTeR BiLlbY gEtS a KnIfE aNd MuRdErS cHiLdReN
Marble actually looked like he was having such a good time, it made me really happy. Very wholesome.
No Australians still call him the Easter bunny from my experience
To answer your question on the Easter Bunny, the Rabbit is a symbol of Fertility.  The modern Christian holiday of Easter is an evolution of the Celtic fertility festival, of which a Rabbit was one of that festival's main symbols.  

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Church in Rome effectively made pagan holidays Christian as a way to ease tension between Christians and Celtic Pagans.

The end result is that a lot of Christian holidays have seemingly arbitrary components that have nothing to do with the Christian faith.

Another good example is Krampus being a pre-Christian mythological monster that was then converted into a symbol of Satan that trails St. Nicolas.
Idk why but Kermit finally noticing peach found the treat @15:19 is the best part of the video 😂
just knowing julien is dressed like THAT behind the camera is unsettling
4:14 “he’s buffering” lmao julien kills me
1:00 Peach sitting directly in the middle of the fireplace and staring into my soul has so much energy
hey I'm from Australia THAT IS NOT TRUE we only see wild bunnies as pests and we still have an easter bunny
Everyone says marbles is 👁👄👁 but I think marbles is more 👁👅👁
peach: the smartest
marbles: the cutest
kermit: THE NASTIEST
Please make a video where you read weird Wikipedia pages and comment on it
this is kinda latr but

you can say Peach has mastered the egg challenge by carrying the eggs and not breaking them yet
The Easter bilby gets a KNOIFE and MURDERS ChILDREN
I’m very excited to be a 🎶 32 year old lady 🎶 with 4 dogs, can’t freaking WAIT
"the Easter bilby gets a kNOIFE....and mURders chILDRE" omg IM SCREAMING😂
there were...an overwhelming number of “good boy!!!!!”s and “good girl!!!!”s in this video
but I am fully here for it
I need a husband that an Aries, but at the same time I don’t want to become a widow either 🤷🏽‍♀️
Easter Bilby 😂😂😂
I'm from Oz, 36 and I still believe in the Easter bunny 👯‍♀️
Who else is excited for today/tomorrows video where we finally get to meet Bunny!!❤❤
Jenna: This has food in it!
Marbles: 👁👄👁💦
I love the organ music in the background. Sooo cute. Y’all are the cutest parents.
They look so funny when they're on the hunt, Italian greyhounds are a living meme
the Easter bilby XD. Hmm I don't recall an Easter Bilby coming to my house
This was so cute and creative! God Bless Your Creativity and love to your pets 😃😇
I love their low ass standards for marble. ‘He put his paw out!!’
6:44 Actually, yeah, he can’t see it. Dogs can only see the blue green spectrum, so colors like red only come out as grey. That combined with the egg’s general shape probably made it so that then he couldn’t tell it wasn’t just another rock.

🌈The more you know🌈
'your head is shaped like a bicycle seat' ...am crying now
As an Australian I can confirm that we have an Easter Bilby and an Easter Bunny
Can you please do a video where you attempt cookie art?! I find it extremely satisfying to watch and would love to see you attempt it 😂 you’d make me forever happy
cermet could open the eggs 
peach could find the eggs 
marbles...existed
I love Marbles. He is so damn cute. Lil og.
We got tilapia as a pest over there, many are consider pest in Australia...
Marble: find it for me and open it for me
Kermit: find it for me so I can eat it while being nasty
Peach: I AM AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN
Rewatching this waiting for this weeks video bc I know it'll be introducing bunny to the family and I'm so excited.
Jenna: “If ya in ya 30s with no kids this is what you get to look forward to”
Me: "Perfect, can't wait"
I'm really curious here does marble have a smooth brain
0:47 Peach watching you from the burning pits of hell
About the Australia thing, yea it’s true 😂( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡~)
In Australia we don’t really say Easter billby... most parts in Australia we don’t really have rats so we really don’t find them as pests..
The Easter Bilby gets a knoife and murders da children
This shows that Peachy is superior and classy at the same time
Omg..Kermit in the window crying had me laughing SO hard!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Came here after all the drama needed something to calm me down 😂
"I think Marbles is gonna suck." 
No faith 😂
Nobody:

Jenna: three out of ten Norwegians like to go skiing for Easter
Can we just talk about Julien for a Sec..... I DIED WHEN HE DID THE WHIP
peach in the background at  :46  lmaoooo
This video honestly has me in tears🤣🤣
the BEST thing to do when you're sick is to watch this
"Here he comes!" 
cuts to marble hobbling over with his tongue hanging out his face. 
"Seabiscuit himself!"
No in Australia there is no Easter bilby 😂
No, us australians still have bunnies 😂😂
Marbles is so so so so so cute I wanna love on him I love him so much I need me an elderly Chihuahua
Owww i can't wait for Bunny to play this next year 🐰🥚
There’s nothing that screams ‘Easter’ like Julien aggressively whipping in a bunny costume
yes the easter bilby is a thing here. but i like bunnies so, australia has to get their game on.
I find a lot of thinks funny... But i rarely laugh out load. I laughed out load several timessz. I'm home alone but i donnnt CARE.
0:58 PEACH: I IS ONE WITH THE FIRE
Other youtubers: Coachella vlog !1!
Jenna: Doing an easter egg hunt for my dogs
3/10 norwegians?? literally all norwegians go skiing in easter! and we eat oranges and kvikk lunsj :D !!
Uhh, and another Human "Flying over the CooCoo's nest....Good Grief...DOGS ARE ANIMALS, NOT CHILDREN
Came here for some unproblematic Youtube... was not dissapointed #WeStan
I cant wait to see this with Bunny next year <3
"Happy Easter Marblesss"

INTENSE TAIL WAGGING

Made my day
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever watched
Who's making the creepypasta horror cut with the shaky handheld shots of distant blurry Julien-bunny in the yard?
LOL! Did you notice who was staring at you behind your back 0:46 - 1:08 I love how Peaches is centered in front of the fireplace and then you just watch her staring at you with a halo of flames behind her.
Nice PIKACHU COSTUME but it's not  HALLOWEEN......☺
every other youtuber: at Coachella without any clothes on 
jenna: being a 32 year old lady
-Why are you saying wow? 
+'Cause he found it all by himself!!!!!! 
4:37


omg jajajajajajajja had me laughing so much
marble, who has no teeth, still drools less than kermit
Peach killed this lol and also the death glares from Kermit when it was her turn has me dying 😂😂😂
LIVING for Jenna's Australian accent
Cermet: I am very good at opening. 
Peach: I am very good at finding. 
Marbles: I am very good.
Hello I am Australian
Yes we do have a Easter Billy
but all the people I know and myself use the easter bunny
Hope this helped
♡Oh,my God,how cute marble is♡
Bunny was around at this time huh?! HUH?!
On,y some parts of Australia think bunnies are pest, I wang one but they are illegal :(
you should take Kermit to a dog psychic so they can talk to him and figure out why he’s so nervous and stressed all the time 😂😂
Next year you should do this again but with bunny too!
When peaches jumped on the table😭
Granite is very adorable.
Easter Bilby 100% !!
peach= 4.0 student athlete 
kermit= still smart, weird band kid
marble= super senior
This never popped up in my sub box :(
2:31 Peach is like "okay mommy go ahead and murder"
13:42... when the teacher moves you to the back of the class and you just watch all your friends have fun
I feel like peach’s intelligence is evidence of natural selection 😂 compared to Marbles and Kermit 😂
Nobody:
Jenna: uploads the cutest video of her dogs Easter egg hunting on a WEDNESDAY
0:49 Peach in the background BOW DOWN TO ME IM SATAN
Anyone else notice how with each dog their intelligence level grows lol
I CANT WAIT TO MEET BUNNY!!!
This is exactly how Easter went with me and my nearly 1.5yo baby.  Just so you know. 
Both equally as scared of grass.
Marbles: doesn't know what an egg is, hardly knows what's happening ever
Kermit: nasty. nasty gross. Hand me treats cermet needs treats EGG HASS TREAT? SLOBBER
Peach: Egg hunting? Mere child's play. I am smart child. I dine in comfort
Can't wait to see a video with Bunny!
When Peach is smarter and more athletic than I am...
literally my mom would always yell the same thing at me when we would go to church 😂






ARE THERE DRRRRUGS IN HEREEE
I'm Australian,
Personally I believe in the Easter Chicken.
But yes, rabbits are pests here because they eat our farmers crops.
Some people do believe in the Easter Bilby.
But lots of us just say Easter Bunny.
Peach: Gracefully jumps onto table

Also peach: Trips over nothing
How and why did 2.3k people dislike this video, I always just imagined that Jenna was a Queen and everyone loves her ❤️
peach and marbles are like worlds apart you cant even tell they are from the same species
An easter bilby?






Was I lied to?
14:31 SEA BISCUIT IS INCHES,,, AWAY,, LMAO WHY DID THIS MAKE ME LAUGH SO MUCH
Marbles really is on some kinda planet that isn't ours sometimes huh
Peaches immediately solves the puzzle, Kermit needs some help to solve the puzzle and then a bonus reward because he's upset he didn't do it as good as Peaches, and Marbles already forgot that there was a puzzle
Kermit is me in high school. Peach is me in middle school
Peach be doing a booty camera smack
Can confirm, Australians do have an Easter bilby lol.
i was NOT ready when julien turned the camera around, the bunny suit caught me SO OFF GAURD
We do have an Easter bilby and rabbits are pests.. but the bilby doesn’t get the same love as the rabbit
It was changed to try and teach kids that rabbits are pests and bilbys are native ✌🏼
Marble is somehow both a toddler and a senile old man.
12:28 ASDFKOJASFASOFASKJL look at kermit omg
Cant wait to see bunny do this next year!
jenna: offers a fun, engaging activity that is also rewarding
marbles: 👁👄👁
Yes. We do like to go skiing. I can confirm that as the Norwegian I am. 😂
This is actually reaaaally good enrichment for animals, all animals can problem solve, even fish can do tricks it's soo good for the mind, I love that jennas channel has kinda turned into showing people how smart dogs are and fun things you can do with them
👍❤️
I have parrots and a big part of owning them is keeping them engaged and foraging is a big part so seeing dogs and any animal forage makes me happy lol😂
Peach is so smart 😮
Girl, you are high!!!! Period!
Paesh: good at finding
Cermat: good at opening 
Marbull: good at eating 

Perfekt team. 10/10
Jenna: Look Marble! What's this?
Marbles, an intellectual: is colorless rock.
Totally worth the 16 minutes and 54 seconds 😍😍😍
😍  please do this every year! 💜
"unfortunately his will to survive is getting stifled by blades of grass" the fact that the phrase perfectly describes marbles' existence says a lot
13:42 letting ur cermats Crai will not halp dem graw
Already cant wait to see it next year with Bunny!!!
Rabbits are pests but we still say Easter Bunny 

By the way I live in Australia 🇦🇺
Easter Billy rules
Im ded laughing 😭😂😅😂🤣😂🤣
hahahah this was great.. next year we'll bring Matty over for round 2!!!
I love the doggie content 😍

And Peach JUMPED 😱
Julians last day being a loud ARIES before Bunny <3
My whole family lives in Australia and we grew up with the Easter bunny 😂
lol I can never subtly watch your videos in class it just never works but I do it anyways
Jenna’s dogs comes in different skill levels. 

Marbles: Tutorial/Noob
Kermit: Starter
Ok but why was your Australian accent so good?? 🤣 🤣 🤣
When Peach jumped, your reaction made me almost choke and die I laughed so hard 😂
I hAve alwaYs lived iN Australia and I have never herd of the Easter bilby  we have Easter bunnies
Did anyone else notice how at 0:48 Peach is sitting in front of the fireplace death staring the camera??😂
Marble- Beginner
Kermit- Intermediate
Peach- Expert
Eggs and bunnies are from Wiccan/Pagan traditions to represent new life and renewal for Spring. They have nothing to do with Christianity
Cute video :)
Y'all someone's part of the fam now 
Let's welcome Bunny
0:47  Peach just casually channeling the God of Hellfire in the background.
Its true! Im Norwegian. I went skiing this easter😂 So did four out of the eight other people I travelled with.
Marbles: too old and tired to find eggs

Kermit: too nasty to find eggs 

Peach: smart
Maybe you should do a " My dogs pick out my Outfits/Outfit " In my opinion I think it would be a good idea for a video.


P.S I love you,Julian (sorry don't know how to spell his name) the dogs, and your content❤️

(◕‿◕✿)
Kermit jealous asf through the window 😂
I dont even have dogs and this is the best video
The Eayster bilby get a knayfe and maydaurs childran
Peach is what we get if we use 100% of our brain
CONGRATS ON ADOPTING BUNNYYY !!!
I loooooooooooooove the music they put in the background 

I also genuinely loooooooooooooooveeeee these two they are my favourite YouTube couple hands down.
He protec
He attac 
But most importantly 
He back away from snacc
Julien at marble: “hes buffering”
😂😂😂
Jenna: marble look over here points at Easter egg

Marble: 👁👅👁 looks in different direction
Your channel is the best thing on youtube. I love you guys so much!!!
why does marbles always look like hes having a full body stroke?
Omg this video was amazing 1st time watcher,,, new subscriber. Loved this video.
This video Easter so very,very funny Julien 🐰 Easter Bunny and you.O MY GOD!!! I very love ❤️ this video.Wow Marble see on 🥚 💛💛💛
Peach very clever dog girl I love you Peach
marble twitches his leg
Julien: he’s buffering
How could anyone dislike vid? Iz hilariouz.
When are y’all gonna give that adorable new greyhound their own video? 🤗
15:15 
Cermet: Was my egg, Mom my egg she stole my egg 
Peach:*eats treat* no mine
Marble: am happ
0:46 Paesh...you are soooo centered and cute!
🤣😂😅 He's Buffering 🤣😂😅
I’m Aussie and I’ve never even heard of an Easter bilby 😂😂 we just have the bunny as everyone else does 🌼
Btw this was hella funny. Also I used to watch your early videos a ton a few years ago but then thought you went inactive and was so sad. My friend recently starting saying "Hell yeah!" Like you do and  so I looked you up and was so happy to see you're still around. Thank you for your content every Wednesday slash Thursday lol it really helps cheer me up when college is stressing me out❤
"He's buffering" POOR MARBLES LOL
In another instalment of "Jenna tries to use up her 1 million dog treats"
Is it me or seeing the Iggy's actually being good at this is satisfying
I'm from Australia and I've never heard of an Easter bilby 🤣🤣 I don't even know what a bilby is haha
aight to clarify what the easter bilby is, we dont usually se bunnies/rabbits as pests, we just have a species called the Bilby which is like a Bunny, but has a longer snout, eats insects like spiders, crickets and berries if they can manage to find them, they are EXTREMELY endangered (there are less than 400 left..) in Australia, some families tell their children of the ordinary, "Easter bunny" and buy their children a chocolate bunny every year but in order to spread awarness of the endangered bilby, they brought out a chocolate bilby that if you but the chocolate bilby a part of the money is given to the "save the bilby fund" which helps the fund breed these precious little animals so that hopefully they can bring the numbers back up. personally i prefer the Easter bilbies because i know the money goes to saving an animal, but now because cadbury decided to not sell them anymore, the other companies decided to bump up the price because they're more rare now. so now theyre sold for 12 freaking $ EACH and only 60 cents of that goes to the bilby fund (which is pretty sad tbh) anyway thats the explanation of the easter bilby
Honestly the Marbles run is accurate for young kids in their first few hunts. Kermit is about the 5-7 range. Peach is the 8-10 range.
Marble had a handicap 😂how is he supposed to know where the eggs are if he doesn’t even know where he is😂
I'm from Australia and that's the first time I've heard about an Easter bilby, we have the Easter bunny 😂
No it’s not true I live in nsw in Australia and we have an Easter bunny
Maybe Juliet will get a horror movie edit this time
Omg Peach is so good at the hunting part. So cute!
peach: finds the egg, opens the egg, gets up on the island
kirmit: opens the egg
marbles: travels to another dimension leaving his dead sea biscuit body behind
The most engaged I have ever seen Marbles! And oh my lord I am soooooo excited for the next video I'm crossing my fingers that it's a getting Bunny vlog!!!
Marble. Exe stopped working
Oh I just grinned ear to ear each time they'd crack one open! Clever, clever Iggies ❤️
Omg marble is the cutest dog ever
"What'd you do to kick off Easter weekend?"

Other Youtubers: COACHELLA! 
Jenna & Julien: We did an Easter egg hunt with the dogs and wore bunny costumes.

Lol, LOVE IT. ❤️❤️
"Marbles is gonna S U C K" -Julien 2019
Marbles buffering is the cutest thing but also the funniest
Easter Bilby is not a thing okay?
“ The Easter bunny is here to listen to you” I lost it🤣
this would have been perfect for ms. bunny
This channel radiates pure millennial mid-life crisis energy and I'm all for it.
I like how she mentioned how fun this would be with a big dog... then she gets biggie 👍
Wait so are you straight up just gonna post a video and not welcome me back to Being A 32 Year Old Ladyyy™
Peach is the honour roll student 
Kermit is the kid who’s so stressed he’s almost given up 
Marble is that kid who’s always asleep in class
@JennaMarbles 
Video Idea: Give your dogs a massage
You should make a bycicle seat cover with kermits head on it for merch
1:07 I´m Norwegian and it actually surprised me that its only 3 out of 10...
Other YouTubers: Coachella
Jenna: Easter egg hunt for my dogs. 😂❤️❤️
no we have an Easter Bunny. 
from your Aussie friend Abbie
I feel like Jenna should react to dandruff removing videos😌
"I am so mad" while petting Peach, way to go dog training XD
I lost it when they zoomed in on Kermit after he realized peach got both eggs. Actually sprayed spit all over my phone from that laugh 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
juliens dog: rocket scientist

jenna’s dogs: comparative to a leaf and a twig
"Unfortunately his will to survive is being stifled by blades of grass". That killed me
CANT WAIT FOR A BUNNIE VID 😍
1:50-1:56 why did that entire situation just crack me up?!
00:46 "It's when Jesus rises from the tomb"... *Peach in the background standing exactly centerd with the flames in the background*.. XD It just seemed so perfect.
Julien all blurry in the background hiding eggs as the Easter bunny is the funniest fkng thing I’ve seen all year
I started cracking up when they talked about if Kermit sniffed out drugs in an airport.

Officer: 

Kermit: 😢 There’s drugs in here
"3/10 Norwegians like skiing for easter" I thought it were more that 3/10 honestly, we like us a good ski trip
Post a video of your new dog!!!!
Marbles detective skills are un matched😂

Nobody:


Jenna: Dresses up as Easter bunny and makes Easter egg hunt for unappreciative dogs.
Jenna: Marble LOOK!!


Marbles: yall hear sum?-
There is nothing I enjoy more in my life than watching videos of Jenna's dogs, they are all so precious.
She protecc

But most importantly 
  She make her dogs a colorful Easter snacc

These dog videos literally save my life everyday, love that Jenna gets that we are all stressed and just need a little peaceful escape sometimes
12:30 oh my gawd the look of kerm and peach 😂😂😍
you should try agility with peach!! shell prolly love itt
Your Australian accent sounded better then mine what the hell
Marble: Oh look, food in an Easter egg.
Grass: (Exists)
Marble: Oh no, there’s grass in the way. Guess I’ll starve.
1:56 i DIED i can SO relate
we do not have an easter Bilbi. hahaha you can never trust Wikipedia


your videos make me smile
The fact that peach jumped up on the island made me scream.
Will we get a video about bunny soon?
I'm Australian and there is no such thing as an Easter Bilby 😂
Jenna:Uploads on a Wednesday 

Everyone:Wait thats illegal
"if you don't have kids in your 30s you have this to look toward to" are you implying that's a bad thing? I'm looking forward to this.
I’m Australian and we still have a Easter bunny 
Also bunny’s are pests in most parts of Australia but people still keep them as pets sometimes including me
Unfortunately my will to survive is being stifled by blades of grass
I can't concentrate in the video because peach I suppose just went to the perfect place to be in the video, right behind jenna in front of the fireplace. Lololol 😂😂
PEACH IS SO FREAKIN' SMART!! You guys should teach her how to use an doggy obstacle course!!
Wow imagine cement looking for drugs and then accadently just eats them😂😂😂
Was this video an easter egg of her getting a new dog named bunny!?!?!?!?!?!??! MEGA CONSPIRACY THEORY.
OMG I LOVE JENNA! Shes literally me haha. Definitely my inspiration for my videos <3
yes this is true australia
can you and julian make friendship bracelets together for a video <3
Australia: That's not true. But okay.
Marbles: breathes Jenna: Good job!!!! ❤️
This was awesome so cute and satisfying to watch! Peach is a beast! She’s got the womenly dog instinct
Should’ve put Irish Spring soap in some of Kermit’s eggs lol
Easter is the Christian celebration of Jesus rising from the grave three days after being crucified. I'm a Christian and this, to me, is the most important part.

But i'm like 99% sure dying eggs and having hunts and stuff has literally NOTHING to do with the actual holiday hahahaha, its just for fun I think :)
"sometimes i read wikipedia and i dont know whats going on"


m   e
🐰🐰You dressed as bunnies for your pups? That's too cute!
I will have to try an Easter egg hunt next Easter with my iggy sans the bunny suit!
MARBLES TONGUE IS SO WEIRD ITS FRICKIN ADORABLE
Peachy is the smartest in the family and it makes my heart so full. 
She's a blonde that get's straight As and has lots of friend's in the hallway and plays track and field but loves her weird brother Cermet that breathes too loud next to the lockers and her dumb brother Marble that his trying his best in school.
dogs are colourblind. i just realised how much this changes finding brightly coloured eggs
as an australian i can confirm the easter bilby is a real thing 



(the easter bunny is still a thing though)
Tbh this is one of the best videos on yt
0:47
LIKE FIRE
HELLFIRE
Marbles: mother h a l p
Kermit: NASTY

AND M U R D A S CHILREN
Lol no 😂 we still have the Easter bunny in Australia
Will you please turn yourself into one of your plants?
The dogs in a summary
Marble:❓
Peach: 👑 
Cermit: 😰
0:47 i think your KeRmEt is on fire🔥
Next video: stroke painting. Kthnx 😘
I think Peachy’s becoming a cat
Love you I watch one of your videos and then I subscribe it toke one video to love you
Plastic eggs: $2
Dog treats: $10
Watching jenna use peaches jaws like a stapler to bite open Easter eggs: priceless
Now put a bunch of empty ones around 😂
I imagine doing this with a scenthound with be really fun because they would probably do a really good job tracking down the treats!
Rabbits are pests but I have never heard of the Easter bilby and I've lived in australia my whole life
0:46
paesh would rather burn than hunt for eggs
They’re like selecting game modes. 
Marble- tutorial
Nasty boi- easy
Peach- expert
"Unfortunately his will to survive is getting stifled by blades of grass" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀
Please meet branditv, you guys are twins lmao
“Can I also have that ladies sandwich” Nah Kermit will be like “Cani have your soap”
Marbles is the cutest no doubt😍 I just smile every time I see him😊
julien: she’s so polite 
peach 30 seconds earlier: jumps on counter
Why did I love this so much? I couldn't stop watching
the easter bilby
yes, it is true. 


-australia
like an eighth of Australia uses the Easter bilby most use the bunny boy 
im from perth
“Hey kids, ready to hunt for some candy?”

Aggressively whips
Im Norwegian and i allways go downhillskiing in easter (i go downhillskiing alot when its not easter too tho 😂) but its tru that Norwegians go skiing in the easter (and when its not easter)❤
12:30 "He knows EXACTLY what's in there." I literally cried with laughter
Nobody:

Jenna: “THE EASTAR BILBY GETS A KNOIFE AND MURDARS CHILDREN!”
At 5:59 I found myself clapping for Kermit. #youknowyouraparentwhen 😂
10:14 jenna's first instinct is just "i'm telling your dad" lmaooo
Marbles is so adorable I love him 😭
1:56
creepy guy in a bunny costume- hes my son 
marbles- help me im being taken
But then again Kermit😩😍 I love your fur babies!😍😩😩
OH GOD THIS IS SO INCONSISTENT ahahahahaha
"AN EASTAH BILBY GETS A KNOIFE, AND MURDAHS CHEELDREN!" ~ Jenna, 2019.
Marbles in a my emotional support dog HES SOOOOO CUTE
As an Australian I can say we love bunnies and the Easter bunny lol
Seeing Marbles move kills me
Anyone else catch a glimpse of Bunny’s feet walking by after Peach jumped on the island lmao
I love kermit, but every time I look at him he reminds me of a salted snail
The Easter bilby gets a knoife and mudas children
Lol the Easter Bilbie is probably a thing but I’ve never heard of it😂 Rabbits are pets here but there are so many. They breed so quick so I guess they are a pest...

Edit: I just searched it up and the reason why we have an Easter bilbie is because the rabbits are taking over the bilbies and they are in the vulnerable category.
I hope I speak for most other aussies when I say IVE NEVER HEARD OF AN EASTER BILLBY good god
I did this for my dog because of your video and she absolutely loved it! It was such a fun and enriching activity! Thanks for sharing!<3
“Peach can get things, bring them down, Kermit will rip them open and then they’ll share them together, like RAPTORS.”
im crying
I am one of the seven norwegians that DONT go skiing in easter 😂😂 its been crazy hot here lately, so the snow disappared anyway🙈😂
In Australia, we do see rabbits as pests (wild ones), we do have an Easter bilby, but we still have the Easter bunny 😬
12:06 peach moving easter egg on gravel ASMR
LOVED this!! And because of your video I did the Easter Egg Hunt for my tiny dogs and it was a HIT! thank you!!
Peach is what we get if we use 100% of our brain
Ahh peach is on fire! 🐕🔥 🔥 at 1:05
This was so much fun to watch. Thank you for going through so much effort with your dogs and sharing it with the world
Can somebody make a horror trailer of Julien being the easter bunny 🐰🐇🐰🐇🐰
Yes it is true we have a easter bible but we also have the great rabbit fence thing that goes halfway across Australia 🇦🇺ps what breed of marbles
“Did it come out?”
“Oh god he’s eating leaves”
You can do this with their dinner or breakfast :) great enrichment game
I love this idea.👏👏👏👏💕
OMFG when the camera turned to julien in a FULL BLOWN Easter Bunny outfit I SPAT
Ok but the noise of kerms and peach biting the plastic egg was ASMR and a half for me, thankyou
lol peach's just sitting there in the background looking like she's planning to kill someone haha
Peach is sooo talented (sorry for my speling im from another country)
Kermit waiting for the respawn. 😂
This video has reminded me of two things.
1. Damn, Marbles is OLD. 
2. Peachy is possibly the smartest being in that entire video.
YES the BILBY is correct in Australia.. they are endangered species so we must save them...
Not true!!! Easter bunnies here in Australia
Rabbits are seen as absolute pests in Australia as they very damaging to native habitats and are endangering native wildlife HOWEVER Easter bunnies are still pretty much the norm, although the Easter bilby is also common
This is the content no asked but needed in the end🤧😂
Julien calling marbles "Seabiscuit" really did me in
0:47 it looks like peachy sat inside the fire😂 like if u saw——————>
please do this every year for easter!
Okay, I can help bring light to the questions asked. First, Rabbits and Eggs symbolize fertility. Easter, the name, was created to overshadow the pegan holiday that celebrated Ezter (Queen of Fertility). Catholic Church created certain holidays, so they can pull attention from old pegan holidays. Have you ever heard of St. Patrick's Day? St. Patrick was responisble for introducing Christianity to Ireland.
FACT: every woman over the age of 29 owns a pair of Crocs.
Make an agility course for the dogs in your yard!!!
That beginning made me laugh 😂
That easter billy part had me in tears. I was like “that’s not how we say that” but then I said the words out loud and yeah, that is exactly how we Australians would say that’s sentence
2:55 Actually made me look forward to my 30's
This is the wholesome content I needed
Titles for Jenna’s dogs at egg hunting:
Marble: The Oblivious
Kermit: The Strong but Nasty
Peach: The BEAST
Edit: my god look at these likes 🥳
You should make snuffle mats for them. They are a ton of fun for doggos. Its a similar concept to an easter egg hunt.
This video just made my day
Murbles is hilarious
hellllllllll noooooooooo we have a bunny lmao
.

btw don't use Wikipedia because u can get an account and type anything so yea its manly lies
Girl, it's still Wednesday... and the sun is up. Your video is so early! It's an easter miracle
13:42 I CANT 😂😂🤣
I’m Australian and I grew up with the Easter bunny ( my friend has actually seen him not kidding) but we do also have Other Easter animals as stated, I’ve seen chocolates of then when you buy it I think you donate to an awareness or something


Idk why I went to all that explaining bc probably nobody will se it but if you did your welcome I guess idk bye 🙂

Also from - I was dying silent laughing (bc my parents are asleep)and almost squealed trying to hold it in especially at  when cermit was staring at peach also sorry if I spelt cermits name wrong idk how to spell it how you do but now I’m done.
I CANT WAIT TO SEE BUNNY OH MY GOF
Im Australian. We have the Easter bunny
Marble: does anything

Julien: you helped him

Jenna and the internet: YEAH MARBLE YOU DID SO WELL! AND YOU DID IT BY YOURSELF!
I love how every video involving all her dogs is Marbles not knowing wtf to do and failing miserably at it, Kermit doing an okay, basic job at it, and Peach dominating and getting a 10/10 on everything she does!
Hello from Australia - yes it's true! We once built a massive fence to keep rabbits and other pests out. There is an easter Bilby, but it's becoming less common now, easter bunny is defs still a thing also.
I’m an Aussie THAT ISNT TRUE!!
NOOOOO australia has an easter bunny BUT we do see them as pests
JULIEN FYCKIGN FLIPPED THE CAMERA WITH THAT SUIT ON AND MY FIGHT OR FLIGHT RESPONSE KICKED IN SO HARD
kermit sauntered on over to peach at the end like swiper
Okay I was crying laughing for the first minute at blurry peach sitting perfectly surrounded by fire...
3:29 I LOVE HIS TOUNGE
i love that there being 100%  genuine in their bunny  onsies and crocs
Collectively Marbles, Peach, and Kermit share 3 brain cells, and Peach has 2.5 of them. 😂 <3
I did an easter egg hunt for my cat 2 years ago, he slayed & got catnip hiiiigh
Peach could compete at like base lvl (I have no idea what the translated proper terms into English would be)
“Oh god he’s eating leaves!”
I need a video about the pack's zodiac signs.  Idk if you know their actual birthdays, but if not then just determine what you think they are.
Somehow those pink crocs just work with the Easter rabbit onesie lol 

Never though I’d use that sentence
Omg I love I Justine too you guys were like my first fav you tubers!!!!!
Dbdixhrbhchkatgj95husjNdor8rifgsiyoatvj&? $&j
“I’m 32 and this is how I choose to spend my time” omfg😂
why the heck is peach in the fire at the beginning
Jenna: happy Easter marbles!!
Marbles: buffers
Me: THE MOST ALIVE IVE SEEN HIM IN A LONG TIME
This is the purest video on the internet. 

And also OMG PEACH!!!!!
Peach is your smartest dog.
My dog actually takes the seed out of sunflower seeds without eating the shell and he also takes any food (candy/granola bars) out of people's purses.
no. 
from australia
The Easter Bilby is exists in a few regions in Australia
Peach: The Princess

Kermit: The Nasty Boi 

Marbles: 
Julien bout to star in his own CREEPY TRAILER WITH THAT COSTUME BOIIII
Legit thought peach was a sqirrel for a sec
I love how much  J&J love their doggos
Marbles has like 3 moods:
1. Where am i?
2. Love jenna
3. Attaccc
the easter bilby is 100% a thing but we still have the easter bunny too
You should make an obstacle course for the iggys!!! It's surprisingly fun watching them figure things out and be smart 😂
its trippy watching this back knowing theres a new dog.
Yes, In Australia we have the Easter Bilby but still most children use the Easter bunny
Marble-10% effort 
Kermit-50% effort
Peach-100% effort
4:22 is the most sarcastic “wow, congratulations” i have ever heard
I love that you just adopted a dog! I just fostered my first puppy and it was amazing! I posted a video about it :)
Omg Jenna you look so cute in the bunny onesie. Like total girl crush lol
You can just hear how repeatedly in love Julien is with Jenna at 2:20 when she steps out and his aries is suddenly super soft and no longer as chaotic as just seconds before (1:35). I LOVE THEM 😭❤
LIKE TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY 
cuts to marble
“If YoU hAd A bIg DoG tHiS wOuLd Be So FuN” had a bunny in the works

(I’m jk I know bunny has to adjust and acclimate before they can attempt something like this with her)
NO WE STILL HAVE A EASTER BUNNYI live in AUSTRALIA and yes rabbits are pests
julien stalking around the yard is honestly scary
Paech is ‘smart’

Cermit is ‘NaStY’

Marbles is ‘Xp’ (dead)

Bunny is ‘rescued’



UwU
Aw i love how paesh took the eggs she found to the tiny couch because it looked like she knew that was the only soft place where the egg wouldnt slip while she was trying get it open
When youtubers run out of content
Kermit is such a meme lmao and this is so freaking cute!
13:39 when your friends make plans without you
At 12:00 when peach just sits on us.....
no one: 
jenna: posts video on wednesday 
me: YES BEEEEECH!! WHO YOU FIgHtIn’?
Rabbits are pests in aus, but also pets! I’ve never heard of the Easter bilby, we definitely have the Easter bunny
I had tears I was laughing so hard
i just love marble :D
13:42 JULIEN LAUGHING AT KERMIT CRYING IN THE WINDOW IM DEAD
I want a horror edit of julien in the bunny outfit
When Julian first came on camera I started crying.
"He still has some dog instincts" 
Opening eggs.
This is me with my cats.
Kermit cries while watching from inside
“...I don’t think he likes that... I don’t think he likes that” 

“HES MY SON”
please do more where all three dogs are searching at the same time 😂
someone is going to make a horror edit of this i just know it
The egg and rabbit come the pagan Easter holiday which are both symbol of fertility
Australia has Easter bunnies too, seeing an Easter Bilby is as rare as seeing a real Bilby :P
Jenna: I’ve been watching ijustine everyday for 12 years
Me: I’ve been watching you everyday for 12 years Jenna
Peachy could get a job at narcotics if she wanted
can't wait to see this with bunny next year :')) they're gonna have a real easter bunny :'D
this is the cutest shit i've ever seen
jenna: look an egg!
marble: 👁👅👁
Literally No One :

Jenna : ThE eAsTeR BiLbY gEtS a KnIfE aNd MuRdErS cHiLdReN
have i,... never known... that julien was jewish,,,? my god, brooooo same
I am from the land down under....... yes rabbits are a pest.

But we still have the Easter bunny! No Easter billby or whatever you call it so Wikipedia is a lie.
WHERE'S BUNNYYYYYYYY
Easter was originally a pagan holiday meant for spring /fertility and bunnies and baby chicks kind of symbolize fertility and new life.
I'm reporting you as a demonic satanic witch.
It IS AGAINST THE LAW in the United States, and you CAN be arrested for it.
this was before bunny...
Who misses the land shark video from 7 years ago
Ok....when Julian called Marbles Seabiscuit... I literally choked on my chips😂!!
Marble: mlep
Kermit: nasty
Peach: bear grills of the dog kingdom
This is what i live for
Me: Kermit is my idol 
Friend:who the hell is kermit
Easter is a Pagan holiday. I don't want to play favorites but, Peach is so pretty and smart and I love herrrr!!!! Love Marbles and Kermit too 💜
I'm Australian I've never heard of the Easter biliby! I wish I had though because Easter Bilby would be way better than Easter bunny. (No offense to bunnies) your Australian accent was on point though 😂
At 0:47 peach goes and sits down perfectly between the fire and I was just staring at her for like a good 20 seconds
not true, sincerely an australian
16:50 what was that? 💀😂 was he gagging!?
0:50 peachy is pondering about the death of her owners in front of the flame that will one day perish them
Julien is so bad, he’s laughing at Kermit crying inside 😭
This is pretty much peak 32 Year Old Lady and I love it.
They are like miniature deerbruhs! So cute 💕
0:47 peachy is on fire in the back lol
Jenna: Marble look
Marble: slow turn away plz respect my space
Jenna: marble what’s this??
Marble:  👁👅👁
Make sure u use 100% chocolate dogs love it
Kermits face is like. How the hell did peach 🍑 get that egg 🥚!!! 💭💭💭
Yall are the reason I want a greyhound so badly lol
We need more cermit voice full videos
1000% confirms that peach is the smartest and the only one who could survive in the wild
NO I AM AUSTRALIAN AND THERE IS NO BILBY THING
aw so cute! melts my heart!😍
peaches is adorable that she leaves with her food, Kermit is so smart. <3 LOVE this
0:45 PEACH SITS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE FIRE, SHE LOOKS SO OMINOUS
mango: “there is egg”

cement: “what is egg”

murble: “am I egg”
Jenna you’re hair looks so pretty!!
1:59-2:06 is basically Catholicism in a nutshell.
0:47 Peach is Hades from Hercules
I lost my shot when Julien turned the camera around and he's sitting there in full Easter Bunny garb 😂
I wonder if after this peach will be going outside to try to find more even though Easter is over???
also y are u wearing  CROCS
Can’t wait for our new fave bunny to do Easter next year!
Julian: “I’m getting in the spirit of things”
*face mask falls
Julian: “oh”
I laughed to hard at that
LMAO, "Julien, you're Jewish, still wanna participate?"
(Cuts to Julien, full bunny gear)
😂😂I appreciate the unfiltered enthusiasm
For my dogs on Easter we hard boil eggs and that’s how they Easter hunt 😂
The Easta Billby Gets a Noiff, and murders children!
Kermit crying cause there’s drugs in the airport 😂😂😂
Am crying with laughter watching Cermet in the background sitting watching you from the fireplace
Can I just be your dog please..what a life 😂
I was so distracted by Peach in 0:46 and I didn't listen to what Jenna said about Easter. 😂 It was a funny spot though.
Peach is officially smartest dog yayy
as a Bilby, I just want to let you know that,  that is completely true lol
i was the fox lost boy in a peter pan play and my fellow lost boy (hop) wore the same onesie as Jenna
i AM expecting several horror edits of rabbit costume clad julien
We have both it depends on where you live
for marbles third egg I am fully convinced he ate the entire egg
Fricken hilarious
I was born in Australia and grew up in Australia and I’ve never heard of an Easter billby😂😂
Aww Peachy is so smart 😊
I lost it when Julien turned the camera around and he was wearing a full-blown bunny costume!!
Us Aussies have BOTH the Easter bunny and the Easter Bilby, i got no damn clue where the Easter bilby came from but he's around
Omg we absolutely love this video. I have been a fan of your since the beginning. My dog and I love love love your videos with your dogs. This is such a great idea. We watched it and tried it ourselves. Our dog loved it. It is so fun. Thank you guys for this video. ❤❤❤
For some reason Kermit reminds me of a lizard crossed with the velveteen rabbit
Can we talk abt how right when she starts talking about Jesus peach starts standing in front of fire ominously
Conclusion:
Marbles is the cutest
Peach is the smartest 
And Cermit is still....crying.
this is some good enrichment for the pups
imma auzzie - from victoria i still go with the bunny - maybe in different parts they do the bilbie? i donno tbh
As an Australian I can answer your question, though we still have the Easter Bunny, you can purchase chocolate bilbies which normally helps raise money for them, I get one every Easter, though unfortunately, it's not as popular as a chocolate bunny.
Just sitting here...waiting for a video of your new dog Bunny
do an easter egg hunt with ur other kids, the plants
We have the Easter Bilby in Aus, but he kind of just sleeps in the sand while the Easter Bunny does all the work. But the Bilby is adorable, so everyone forgives him and he's the favourite.
Omg I have the same birthday as you bc my birthday is September 15 !!!!!!!!! Omg I love you send me a comment if you get this 😘😘
this channel became a, for my dogs channel.
The Easter Bilby is no lie. Although I think all Australians are confused because we've half been told that it's a bilby and the rest of the world has a bunny so I dont really know what to believe ;-;
“The Easter Bilby gets a knife and murders children!” 🔪
this may be my second comment here but like... just imagine if they had gotten bunny before this and had her be apart of this video or just them trying this with her.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIEN
So The Easter Bunny is actually Jesus after he was risen... He resurrected as The Easter Bunny.
Help JENNA there is a kangaroo (peach)in her house. 😱😂
no one: 
litterly not a soul: 
jenna: the eASTER BILBY... GETS A KNIFE... And murders the children
THE EASTER BILBYYYYYYYYYYY
I think Australia brought rabbits from other countries to have to hunt for if the food they planted didn’t work out, or something like that
15:16 I'm glad Easter is Resurrection  Day I died of laughter
Marbles is that one simple minded friend we all have
Weaches IQ: 4578
Cement IQ: 23
Sea Biscuit IQ: 2
Please make a how to care for your cermet holiday edition
Hey Jenna! Not sure if you'll ever see this, but I just wanted so badly to comment on your new video with Bunny but I know comments were disabled (understandably so, I know you want this process to go smooth and uninterrupted for your family). But, I did want to just reach out to tell you how much I admire you and how much you have shaped me over these years for my love for animals. You are a beautiful soul that gave Bunny such a loving home. You are so slow and patient with all animals you meet and truly are so in-tuned to the ways animals operate, knowing they are fearful but to be understood. I started watching you when I was in 7th grade and haven't stopped since. I'm now about to start my third year of vet school and still look to you for motivation of who I aspire to be and especially who I aspire to be for the animals that come into my life. It has been a privilege to watch you over the years and to see not only Marble's grow, but Peach, Kermit and now Bunny enter your family. I hope this transition goes smoothly for your family and that you continue to make videos that make me CRY WHAT THE FUCK. I'M TRYING TO STUDY OVER HERE hahah, love you lots. Dink dink *
1:00 Peach in the background
"Peach is our only dog"


even from a different video this line still holds true.
Jenna in the onesie is me existing 
And Julian going, "You look so cute!" Is my boyfriend while I exist
It is and isnt true we do still have an Easter Bunny but we also have an Easter Bilby
dRuGs In HeRe
I only went to church for the free donuts and juice after mass ahahhaa
No one:

Julien: aggressively whips and screams

The dogs: 
Australian here. Most supermarkets have mostly easter bunnies, but environmentalists have been pushing for 20+ years to change to the easter billy (which is harder to find- only a few places make them).
i would watch peach find easter eggs for 10 mins straight
I am so happy I watched this video
It really depends on what part of Australia your talking about... I know in Queensland rabbits are banned as pets because they are pests.. but I don't think that applies to every state. I've never really thought of an easter bilby. And never do an Australian accent again! haha
Jenna about marbles: he’s not gonna like that

Julien: He’s MY SON 😂
best birthday present ever, thanks Jenna <3
nobody:
Marble: :P
But, Australian super markets still sell chocolate easter bunnies. And I’ve never heard of the Easter friggin bilby in all my life.
When Jenna came out in her bunny costume dude my heart melted :(( 💛
A MID-DAY WEDNESDAY UPLOAD?!?!? YES. Thank you Jenna.
Why are there so many dislikes on this video?? Like who’s got the time to put a thumbs down this wholesome content?
01:09 
It’s true, we Norwegians like to go skiing in Easter, and winter...anytime there’s snow actually
Cant wait to see the horror movie edits of this lmao
They tried to make The Easter Bilby a thing here in Australia but it didn't really take, I've only ever heard it being called the Easter bunny in Australia in my 19 years of existence.
"Unfortunately his will to survive is getting stifled by blades of grass."
PEACH LEARNS SO FAST
Tiny hands challenge!!
Peach is such a smart girl! She learns so fast.
The Easter Bilby is a chocolate egg shaped like a bilby 😂😂
Marbles? Confused. 
Cermet? Nasty. 
Peach? Athletic. 
Jenna? Virgo. 
Julen? Bilby.
Someone needs to make Kermit egg opening asmr for meme review
Peach sitting in from of the fireplace in 0:49 is giving me demonic vibes lol
omg most excited ive seen marbles. jenna looks so damn cute!!!
No one:

Not a single soul:

Kermit: 
marbles i would die for u
Easter Billy is a thing. Money raised from sales of chocolate Bilbies and other products helps conservation efforts as they’re endangered.
I can confirm that is not correct about australia 😂
Yes the Easter Bilby is a thing in Australia lol
Sometimes I read Wikipedia and I don’t really know what’s going on - Jenna, 2019
Peach looked like she was on fire 0:53
Omg that dog could start word war 4
i am crying laughing! I love J&J and all the doggos.
Konuşmaları anlamasamda video çok keyifliydi.Bu köpekler harika ❤
Julien sneaking around outside in that horrifying rabbit costume looks like that one blurry picture of big foot. 
So naturally now Julien is big foot. 
#confirmed
the costume Julian is wearing is the same costume that rdj wore in that one video a few years ago😂😫
I'm Australian and it is true, we have an Easter bilby lmao. But we can have a bunny too sometimes.
Teaches dog to jump up is surprised when dog can leap onto counter 😂😂
I can’t wait to see you do this with bunny next year!!!!! 😍
"Easter is new favorite holiday. I like Easter. Thank you, Jesus."
Can we pls get a meme edit of marbles’ face on sea biscuit
Marble is always so lost 😂 and Kermit is always crying.
Honestly this has to be my most favorite video I have ever watched! They were so cute and it was just so funny to watch!
Marbles tail wagging 😍😍😭
Jennas voice for kermit Is the best thing I need a. whole video of it
paesh jumps on table
jenna: "i'm telling your dad" 
😂😂😂😂😂
Marbles is like Dora
charles franklin marbles is an old old man
I love that Jenna had to emphasize “at dog level” on where to hid the dog treats LMAO
Peach is an acrobat now
jenna in a thick australian accent: the easter billby gets a knoife and muirders children
that made me HYSTERICAL
I went skiing for Easter
Omfg Julien X'D
Marbles was so happy!! 💖
peach is my new feminist icon tbh
Julen: whips too hard
dogs: WHAT THA FRIIICCCKKKK BORK BORK
marbles listens to limp bizkit; kermit, panic! at the disco; peach, an ecletic combination of mozart, bb king and modern indie.
I stopped celebrating Easter when I was like 5. 😐😐😑😐😐 this was so funny😂
SHOW BUNNY PLEASE
“Sometimes I read Wikipedia and I don’t know what going on” 
I’ve never felt something more
omg i love this!!!
I shoot you not I swiped on my screen to try to get rid of the grease from my fingers (don’t judge me lmao) and at that exact same moment in the exact same part of my screen, Julien’s rabbit nose fell off and for a split second I thought I caused it 😂
Putting all those treats from the “buying my dogs everything they touch video” to use.
How tf could someone unlike this kinda video I can never understand
What the cat ladies are now turning into dog ladies. Lmao. Feminism is great to laugh at lol.
Not true jenna we have Easter bunnies in Australia they aren’t pests
Джена! Мы любим тебя! И Джулиана! Поздравляю с пасхой! Воскресением Христа!
Because "🐰" lay eggs🤔
i LOVE the shots of kermit inside watching peach get treats and julien laughing maniacally at him. 10/10
D O G G I E
11:06 😂😂😂🤣
kermit is such a gremlin!
Julien that whip made my phone cut off.
jenna: “what do u think?”

julien: “i think marbles is gonna suck”

marbles: 👁👄👁
I need to hear more of Jenna’s Australian accent please. For science
Bruh.... I’m DEAD at 8:02 Kermit head is like a bicycle seat lmao😂😂😂
Somebody please make a horror movie edit with Julien’s bunny outfit.
no we have the easter bunny in Australia haha but yes they are pests
Rumor has it if you bite a carrot and say Easter Julien 3 times, a crying cermet will appear in you room uninvited and ask you for eggs
Does anybody else love how Jenna gives Kermit his own voice 💀💀💀🤣
kermit remind me of snoop dog
Haha yea we have an easter bilby
cement watching from the window is a goddamn meme
No one:
Jenna: helps Marble
Jenna: GOOD JOB MARBLE!! YOU DID IT ALL BY YOURSELF!!
10/10 content
The Easter Bilby is true. It started in the 90’s as a fundraiser campaign to raise money for Bilby habitat as they are an endangered animal.
AMAZING!!!!
Peach was just sitting directly infront and center of the fire place in the beginning of the vid
but the real question is...can marbles sit on a hard surface now?
XD peach in the back 0:46
Peach dramatically sitting in front of the flames while Jenna was describing the death of Christ was the perfect amount of drama I needed
The whole Australian Easter bunny thing. The answer is yes and no. We still have a Easter bunny but yes bunnies and hares are a pest. Yes we do have a Easter Bilby although we usually just use the Easter bunny
16:15 Kermit sounds like a party horn
Marbles: breathes
JJ: Good boy!!!!!!!!
Peach: finds egg
JJ: Good girl!!!! So athletic, so clever
Cermet: An Cermet
JJ: Nastyyyyyyyyyy
Kermit the phioenix
The memes are going to be epic
AUSTRALIA EXPLAIN
Australia does not have an Easter bilby
Any Jenna Marbles video with "my dogs" in the title is a heck yes from me
Guess I know what I'm doing with my dog now..
Build your dogs a luxurious dog house and decorate it fancy😎
I LIKE IT YOU'R DOING SOMTHING NICE

"oh shit, my boyfriend's birthday is also April 17th! ...does...does that mean he's an aries?"

...oh no
oh  
Today is ACTUALLY Julian's birthday so happy birthday!
“Julien, what’s that paper towel doing?”

“DHUUDE, just livin’ it’s life, dude! Happy birthday, paper towel! ☝🏼”

Jenna: this is so relaxing!


Julien: Hold my beer
I wonder who dislikes her videoes, Jenna is so pure

IM SO STRESSED BC YALL DIDNT PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE SO IT WOULD SET & STOP SLIDING
"ok, you're already stressing me out." "im standing completely still" 

I can already tell I'm gonna love this video
"Leaning tower of Julen " 🤣😄😂
as a baker, i was laughing when they just attached the piping tips to the already filled piping bags when it's supposed to go in before the frosting.
jenna’s channel has transformed into domestic bliss and i’m here for it
1:30 😭😭😭 julien just sneaking slowly into the frame lmaoo
It was the leaning tower of JULIENAHH
I would literally watch Jenna make a bowl of cereal or do anything I wouldn’t care as long as I get to watch her amazing personality ..
Ro: *wasn't featured in the video *
Jenna: *proceed to mention Ro 17 times *
27 YEAR OLD MAN WITH VERY FASTLY DETERIORATING VISION
0:59 its vanilla, with vanilla frosting, which I know you like (I do like that)
why are they the sweetest grandma and grandpa couple talkin about how their partner likes literally  vanilla ommmg
i just turned 32 earlier this month (ARIES SEASON) and i am saying "i'm a 32 year old lady" as often as possible
absolutely no one:


me in my friend group: 16:59 - 17:05
Okay, but is there a more chaotic atmosphere than Julien dancing and shouting "I love you so much" over the ignored scream of a kettle
Jenna: ''you put the baking soda in, right?''
Julien: instant panic
Pinterest: If you can't find it on there, it's not possible.
No one:
Me: *thinks life is going great*
God:nope.
Me: 9:17
"Sometimes you don't have to do it to 'em" - JennaMarbles 2019
The moment you said his birthday was April 17th I was like oh cool I checked the day and it said it was April 17th then I was like "well happy birthday Julien" xDD
Julien: stands still 

Jenna: you’re stressing me out already
Jul: this’ll be for me
CaN I snacc on this
Je: AbSouLutELy nOt!

”It looks like you’re not paying attention to me”

“You would be right” 🤣
TFW when you find out Julien is 27. He seems much older

Also julien: that’s disgusting 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY/ARIES SEASON

 (Don't worry, I'm single, so I can say that without worrying...)
im confused. i like missed this video and have never seen it before wtf??

WHERE HAVE I BEEN??
(Safiyas famous edible lipstick funfetti cake popped into my head)
i love when julien glopped frosting on the counter and said "don't look"
Julien: stands






Jenna: YoUr STreSsInG mE OuTT
Drinking game: 
Take a shot every time time Jenna says “Rosanna Pansino”
15:20 why isn't noone acknowledging that Julien forgot "i" in his name and wrote Julen
Here we're gonna summon:


 Rosanna Pansinoooooooooo
It must be an Aries thing but I’m also a catcher😂
“People just do this on a Tuesday” as I go in on a Tuesday afternoon to my job as a Pastry Chef 😂😂
15:55 I thought Julien ate the cupcake paper for a second, and my mind went, “oh boy, here we go again” XD
Oof she really hit him with the “we’re just friends” 🤧
Nobody:

Julien: “this my new knife”
Julien: WIFE 😏

Jenna:No julien were just freinds!😑

Me:(waiting for their marriage) NOOOOOO!😭
"julien's a catcher and I'm a pitcher"


we been knew
14:26 = "oh it's video?"
I'm literally crying 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I was totally expecting him to say JULIEN YELLOW!
"I can tell we're not married by the amount you don't bake."

laughs in aries
Woah I just realized I'm about a month older than Julien. Happy (belated) birthday to my fellow Aries!
“That’s really nice julien”
Julien: is dead inside oh this is a video
These people are my inspiration in life. Every time a video comes out, my life gets better. I love u j&j
Did noone notice... Julien MISSPELLED his own name?????? 😆😭
pastor: you may now kiss the bride :)
jenna and julien: WOOOOAH???? we’re JUST FRIENDS! this is my BRAH, my HOME SKILLET BISCUIT, my VRO
I'm new at jenna marbles. Is julian her boyfriend or her friend?
Friendship goals (Happy BiRTHDAY Julien)
No one:
Me: Why does comments in this format have so many likes?
I need a wholesome break from the Tati/James Charles drama, thank you Jenna😍
Julien: I can tell we’re not married by the amount you don’t BAKE
That killed me 😂
lmao Julien in the corner 0:34

"and floss as one" had me cackling
If they don’t have kids in like the next five minutes can I be their kid
That mixing bowl was the biggest bowl I've ever seen and I lowkey need it 😂
The amount of times I screamed PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE
Julien is rocking that substitute teacher look at chef school.
Are we going to talk about the fact that Julien spelled his own name wrong?
Holy crap that bowl is the size of my sink and the tins are like hubcaps xD
I just literally cried laughing for the last two minutes of this video 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 help me
Who else is a 32 YEAR OLD LADYYY? 👈🏼 one here
Whenever Jenna starts with an apology and/or saying 32 year old lady I know I am in for a special treat.
gives extra specific measurement of a tablespoon and a half 
Julien- it's okay if I do more though, right?

NO!!! 😂😂😂😂
You should really try erin mcckennnas bakery
😳
👉👈
Gluten free and vegan
julen: “jenna and i are just friends”
me: 16:59
"It's the leaning tower of julen" 😭😂😂💀
Ask me for the sugar...
Kissy face 

We all need a Julien
why do they always have such low expectations, it’s always amazing what they can do🙌
Store bought wegmans cake? Yes
That is the LARGEST mixing bowl I have ever seen. Where did you get it?!
Happy late birthday Julian and the cake looks great Jenna great job
I honestly can’t wait to be a 32 year old laaaadyyyy and live my best life. 

Sincerely, a 23 year old dude.
Tip: to harden the frosting and solidify the cake, place it in the fridge. 

Also, I prefer cold cakes lmao.
Lol Julian is a catcher and I'm a pitcher ...T...M...I.... 😘
for the love of GOD PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE SO IT WONT SLIP
i used to watch her back in 2008. I started watching her again last year.  I love them together, glad she found her soulmate💓 always makes me happy. I haven't seen my fiance in 3 months.hes coming home soon & our vibes just like theirs. Im Julien tho😂
icing glops onto the counter

“Don’t look..”
Wow I just love watching friends being friends #bestiegoals
You know on a Wednesday/ Thursday and you wait for a new Jenna upload, does anyone else just go watch the other videos to get a fix because you're in the Jenna mood And get impatient like Where is my Virgo! I WANT TO WATCH AND I HAVE TO SLEEP BECAUSE I HAVE A BASKET BALL GAME TOMORROW SO HURRY QUEEN JENNA!!!! 
I am not a Cermet but without my weekly fix I cannot an groa
I like jennas boyfriend. Hes funny 😂😂😂😂😂
Julian is so lucky to have you.. AGH
I didn't hear Kermit cry even once. Is everything okay?
Julien: Ask me for the sugar
Jenna: Can I have the sugar?
Julien: 😘😘😘
did anyone notice he spelled his name like "Julen" on the cake ????
I thought he was so much older. Like early-mid 30s lol
THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS PERFECT AND I AM SO HAPPY WHEN THEY DO COUPLE STUFF TOGETHER.   IT TURNS MY HEART INTO A HOT FUDGE SUNDAY.
Bless Jenna. She did an outstanding job putting up with Señor Tornado.
9:10 can you turn a cr4ck rock into a mountain? Lol 'A Milli' reference
Should’ve let it chilled in the fridge after putting the icing on, then take it out and decorate .
At 0:33 Julien is literally me trying to listen to all the gossip on Twitter 🤣
julien: “look at you go!”
jenna: “...look at me go 🥰”

IM SAD
the size of your mixing bowl gave me anxiety 


or was it Julien 


idk
“It’s Birthday flavored!”
16:36 Coachella hosted by Julen and a 32 year old lady
13:23 julien said “don’t look” when he made a mess 😂😂 lmao I just laughed so hard
No one:
Kermit: cries

No one:
Julien: 
4:54 jenna not rolling up her sleeves for stirring makes me so uneasy
that story about them playing catch is just so wholesome and sweet
Next time you make it - put more powdered sugar in your icing! I wasn't stiff enough, which is why it slid. It looked amazing though!
My dads birthday is also on the 17th of April 

No wonder why they act the same🤔🤔🤔
‘Ask for the sugar’
‘Give me the sugar’
julien kisses
I love these two.
Angel hair cake? 

IM TRIGGERRRRRRRRRRRRED
This makes my heart so warm. I love you guys <3
Jenna - "Can I have the sugar?"
 Julien - 💋💋💋

The cake says “Julen”
Aww y’all such good friends 🥰

😭you can tell how much he loves her . They are legit one of the cutest YouTube couples , if not the cutest . Their relationship is a beautiful type of bond . 
I swear ... if they split 😑.. I mean nah it’s their life and whatever but they just seem so happy w/ each other .
And it’s finally his birthday . HELL YEAH
That is an Aries-sized mixing bowl, my guy
Ask me for the sugar.
No.
ASK ME FOR THE SUGAR. 
Fine. May I have the sugar?
Nobody thinks you're old! 😆
The fuckery in this relationship is everything I want in life
G E T  M A R R I E D  A L R E A D Y
17:39 you know Julien said "I'm going to punish you for my birthday gift" and it was cut out that's why he's smiling
Best part:

When Julien called her wife and she just like “we’re not married. We’re just friends.”

My birthday - April 17th
1 of 6 children
Never had funfetti cake 
Stress people out when I’m just stood next to them because they expect me to do something annoying or stressful 
I’m Julien?🤔🧐
HE’S YOUNGER THAN MY BROTHER WTF
Jenna so Beautiful😍💓💃 I love❤😘 your channel Girl🙆 keep doing your thing and keep us 😄😂😊
:-) its ok if things are not perfect ,because that's what makes it homemade
If they're just friends why is the video called "making my boyfriend a cake" ?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIEN, my bday is April 25
7:16 Julien: “Bake more wife” 
Jenna: “we’re not married, we’re just friends” 
I love them 💕
Sometimes I take long breaks and then I come back and check out what I've missed. Every time I do I'm reminded how you've managed to last as long as you have, and remained consistently entertaining throughout. You guys are the best. You really crack me up.
“So cupcakes today, prank later”
😂😂😂
GOOD JOB ON SURVIVING ANOTHER YEAR JILL-LAWN!!!!
Also, y’all remind me of Roseanne and Dan from the show “Roseanne”.

Why do i always get sleepy watching your videos
Claire from the ba test kitchen is SHAKING

When Julien broke the scissors, then told the kettle to shut up, I lost it.
I loved this!! more baking/cooking videos haha
Happy birthday !
From Russia
Jenna: Why am I friends with this crazy😂😂😂
“Would you like to be my Susan chef”

That’s how I wanna ask someone to marry me
Hi Jenna! To keep your frosting easier to spread, apply a thin layer first- called a crumb coat, and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Then apply more frosting and refrigerate. Keep doing that and you'll find it frosts much easier👌🏻
I loved this!! more baking/cooking videos
OMG my birthday is also on APRIL 17th ! . i cant believe this O MY GOOOOOD
Birthday cakes for the dogs! Birthday months comin up!! 😍🎂
Julien at 0:36 is me when I threw up at 2 am and debate whether or not I should tell my mom.
I can feel Jenna's anxiety through the screen.
Today is April 17th Happy Birthday Juilen 🎉🧁♈️
Jenna is the most unproblematic youtuber ever and I love it
julien holding the camera : HEAVY BREATHING

Loved this video! Sooo much love between you two! You guys did great making your first cake together! Made with love!! If your icing is ever too thin, you can add 1-2 teaspoons of cornstarch, or add some more confectioners sugar little by little! Or if you want to be lazy, you can heat it just a little and do a glaze! Happy Birthday Mr.J!!
Julien and i have the same birthday! I’m so honored! Happy Aries season 😘
that wide angle lens looks amazing !
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH! 😭💖

To make a cake flat instead of cutting off the top just flip it over
Friendship goals
The open draw in the background
"I can tell we're not married by the amount you dont bake"

I Died
Honestly who can relate to the amount of siblings julien has...,cuz can          ( ・◇・)？
I just realized that Julien is younger than Alex Wassabi... WHAT?!
the "hair" was actually an air bubble from the glass molding under and wrong consistancy
so is julien's name spelled as julen and we've been spelling it wrong all this time? lmao
“You Need To Measure It!”

Spills 4 TBS Of Vanilla Into Mix

That couples-floss was just beautiful. I'm crying
Happy Birthday Julien! Unorganized something good today!!!
Hahaha julien in the corner at 0:32 😂
My first thought: "wow, Julien's birthday is in Aries season!? What an amazing coincidence!"
Also you live in LA right? How is a vegan gf cake not a thing you can order there?
0:32   8 yr. old standing in the corner waiting for my mom to get off the phone so i can tell her i threw up:
there's a typo in the title, it should be "baking my boy friend a birthday cake"
WAIT THEY ARE NOT A COUPLE

I had to do a cake decorating competition yesterday where I only had 65 minutes to decorate a cake top to bottom. Thank you Jenna, this vid makes me feel like a pro. It looks Amazing btw.
Happy Birthday Julien! 

From a fellow Aries
Julien: "ask me for the sugar"
Jenna: "no"
Julien: "aSk mE fOr tHe sUgAr"
Jenna: "Okay, can I have the sugar?"
Julien: 
Easter is the day after Aries season ends. Jesus is rising to save us from them. Palms to wave em away and smoke the bitches out. Happy Easter/Taurus season. It ISNT a coincidence that Jesus is rising to rid the Aries
Julien: after writing his name on the cake 😶😁😲”oh, it’s a video!?” That made me laugh so hard I had to keep replaying it 😂
Happy Birthday!!! I can't believe I watched this on your bday 😀😀
"Cut and delete that off the internet forever! " *leaves it in lol
JULIEN SLOWLY APPEARING IN A CHEF OUTFIT FROM THE CORNER OF MY SCREEN MADE ME SPIT MY MILK
Why did I think the title was *"baking my boyfriend into a cake"*?
Wonder why they aren't married...
Jenna that was SOOOO much vanilla holy shit 😂
Jenna if something is too runny you just add more dry ingredients and if something is too dry you just add some wet ingredients ❤ 
Normally that would be flour, powdered sugar, butter or water, but ofc it depends on what you already put in ;) 

I'm not a chef or anything, but I learned from my mom that there are some things you don't double or add too much of, and the rest you can just mix togheter however you'd like it. Like more sugar if you want it sweet etc. and then you just gotta balance it out if it gets too dry or wet. 
Cooking is just a big mess and personal preference and a lot comes with expirience🍰 
I love watching your cooking videos, and I really loved the video with all your plants 🌱 

Also Happy Birthday to Julian 🎂

Much love from Norway 🇳🇴
Boyfriend?? More like boy friend. The space is important, because that’s where Jesus hangs out
Ppl: Happy birthday Julian you are a big boy now how old are you?
Julian: hmmmm... I forget
Jenna: he is 5
Ppl: I thought he was an alien!
Julien licks butter out of measuring cup
"I do what I do. And you do what you can do about it." 
laughs at own joke

I've never related to anyone more in my life
As a full time baker this makes my heart happy! You guys did great!
Happy Birthday Julien❤️
Is it just me or is that metal mixing bowl MASSIVE

Happy Birthday, I am also a 4-17 baby!
Julien and my boyfriend have the same birthday and me and jenna are 5 days apart so we're basically the same.
me: watched 2.5 seasons of the great british baking show
also me: JENNA REFRIGERATE THE CAKE SO IT DOESNT FALL
How to make cake and frosting that is vegan and/or glutton free:

But why are you using a cheesecake pan?!?!?!

Her face when she basically pours a whole bottle of vanilla🤣🤣🤣
Oh my actual god. My mind is blown, Jenna hasn't used the squeaky toy intro since last year
The last 2-3 minutes were golden!
The end of this video basically turned into pure Aries magic
DJ Stovetop comin at you with a sick tea kettle bass drop. Bring your friends only.
My birthday was yesterday 4/16 :) 
I've been running around screaming "ITS ARIES SEASON!!!!!!!" My boyfriend HATES it. It pleases me :)

Also, Happy Birthday, Julien
You know what, I don't think it really matters how the cake turns out. The man eats sprinkles out of the bottle and sugar out of the bag.
HAPPY actual BIRTHDAY JUUULEEENNNNNN :D
jenna im about to be 32 in june, and after watching your videos i really can't wait to be able to say "i'm a 32 year old laddyyyyyy" thanks for making the 30s way more fun than the 20s <3
julien is like a lost child who doesn’t really care about finding his parents
Well congrats i guess. I didn't know his birthday was today lol.
MY BIRTHDAY IS APRIL 17TH!!!! Julian was born on the same exact day I was. 4/17/92 Happy birthday to us bud!!!
Julien yelling at the kettle to shut up still makes me laugh
Do an entire video w Julian but don’t mic him omg
FINALLY, Julien is mic'd! We need all the background commentary
Where's the sqeaky-toy intro?
You guys need to get married
Love this video! So relaxing 😌
ITS ARIES MO- not anymore but I was born April  14 boof
Julien: [speaks in Aries]
Jenna: "This was the energy this video WASN'T meant to be JuLiEn..."
Oh just realize it's April 17th in Indonesia happy birthday Julien! Keep making Jenna laugh so hard 'kay haha and love you both! ❤🎂🎉
"we floss as one" I've never laughed out loud so hard
“Cause Julis a catcher and I’m a pitcher”

Y’all heard it here first, Jenna pegs
Happy birthday JUULEEEEEEEENNN!!!!!❤️♈️
Jenna: "Welcome back to another very boring and domestic 32 year old ladyyyy video"

Jenna you are the most entertaining woman out there Don't ever say that again
Today is Julien’s birthday! Happy birthday 🎉
My screen just straight up went inverted* colors like 2 minutes into the video and I just straight up didn't question it for 5 minutes before I realized there was something wrong with my laptop because this is Jenna's channel, who knows wtf is going on today.


*Not really inverted, but it turned like purples and greens? Idk how to explain it, but it was wack.
My boyfriends birthday is April 17th too :)
Julian gives me anxiety when foods involved
i just know that they are like this off and on camera

it’s adorable 

rosanna and her love with baking 
16:30 from all that julien was doing from this point to the end of the video it had me laughing so hard i pissed myself
Happy birthday to Julien! :)
Love vegan baked goods! It would have been better to just double the recipe and then put the extra cupcakes in the freezer.
Happy actual birthday GLUUUEEEEELIEN

OMG Julien on sugar is priceless :) LOLLL
Oh wow friendship goals
bro juliens chaotic aries energy w jenna’s big virgo energy is a MOOD
I came from russian version of your video just to tell you what your boyfriend's birthday in the same day with that boy who translates your videos. AnD oFCoUrSe hApPY BIRTHDAY JULIEN!!!
Me: *hears “32 year old ladddddyyyyyy”* 
Me: instantly likes video.
I just realized you and Julien are the same age as me and my husband are. :))
32 year old ladies unite!
i always forget how much older jenna is than julien oml
I love how Julien is a 27yo man who misspelled his own name
14:27 I'm the only one that saw those love eyes???? 
Imagine your loved one looking at you like that💘
Me realizing none of the sprinkles stuck to the side has me CRYING
Finding out Julian is younger is sad. lol I am 28 :P
Jenna:why don’t we
Me: why don’t we just 
Like if you got that / if your a limelight
Don't worry, Julie, as you get even older your distance vision gets BETTER ... because your near vision is about to deteriorate. ASK ME HOW I KNOW. I'm a 38-year-old laaaadyyy. 🎵
Happy birthday Julien! 💕
“Put these back in the pantry for your birthday, happy birthday” a Virgo
Love u Jenna, u will always be the best in my book!!!!!
0:50
Ju:I have had angel-
                         Angle hair-
                         Angle food-
if i don't have abs after this i'm suing
"You guys like yo watch our cooking videos because they're fund and relaxing."

And not at all because we enjoy watching Jenna desperately try to control her Aries in the kitchen
No one:

Julien: “birthdays be like...”

*deeply inhales vinegar container”

“that’s disgusting”
lmaoooo he said “i’ve had an angel hair” 🤣🤣🤣
i wish i could have such a good best friend like this
i always like your videos before i even watch them they make me so happy
The no kissing made me think of girl defined they would be proud
title: making my boyfriend a birthday cake 
in the video:
 "we're just friends"
"our first FRIEND kiss" 
"friendship gOAls"
HAH I'M EARLY! Happy birthday, Jullie! I wish you a wonderful birthday! May Kermit bless your soul. ❤
Happy actual birthday, Julien! :D
it just clicked with me that i have friends at uni who are 32 now... theres no generational difference anymore between me and that number. oh boy
Homemade cakes always look messy, yours looks amazing!
A Domesticated Aries, Stressing Out A 32 Year Old Virgo
I know I'm late to the party, literally and figuratively! My chronic pain from my spondylolisthesis and partially titanium spine has been really bad with storm after storm, here. I just got my spinal injections and a new refill of my Oxycodone. Otherwise I've been vegging out trying not to move!

The cake looks cute! You did a great job!

Refrigerate the frosting for it to be stiffer. Also refrigerate the cake so it doesn't slide.

Wilson food coloring gives you the best colors. Very vivid. I used to bake cakes from scratch and decorate them. My three favorites were my niece's Lisa Frank Unicorn, my older sister's "Jaws" cake, (was strawberry cake, then the cake itself was in the shape of the shark from the first "Jaws" movie poster as it's coming out of the water), my son's "A Bug's Life". I did the ant and the caterpillar as cakes. I've also done Taz, the Tasmanian devil for my then husband's birthday and Marvin the Martian.
16:59 when Jenna just stands there and let's Julien's Aries-ness just happen 😂😂😍😍 I love you guys! Hope you had a good birthday, fellow April baby!
You can refrigerate your frosting and if you struggle with layer cakes you can freeze the cake layers to make the job so much easier!
"We're not married. We're just friends"

This cracked me up 😂😂😂
JENNA DO A ASMR COOKING OR THE WHISPER CHALLENGE AGAIN
Ask me for the sugar aww that was soo adorable! 💜💜💜
video suggestion: make a cute montage video of different clips to music/ then show us the stupid stuff in the unedited clips 😂😂😂
Everything is so oversized I'm crying
my preferred pronoun is thirty two year old lady
The reason it wasn’t piping well was because it was vegan. The thing that makes frosting stay in place is merengue powder which is made with eggs.
8:25-8:29 PREACH 😂😂
I'm so glad ya'll have a pasta arm
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIEN 🐒
Julien: “Guys this is my new knife” 

waves in Jenna’s face 

Jenna: 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO JULIEN!
Woah Julien is my birthday twin 🥳
me at 06:44: this literally looks like vomit.. 
jenna 2 sec later: it looks really nice tho
rip, will never understand vegans
Your cake looks good but it's sliding because u didn't flatten the top of the bottom one ❤️
can I snack on this?
absolutely not
is already pouring bag of sugar into his mouth
I would pay actual money to see Jenna guest on Nerdy Nummies.

It could be a trilogy...

Video one:Jenna and Ro, baking together.  While Jenna tries to not swear.
Video two: Jenna, Ro, Cermit, Paesh, Meeples, Cookie and Muffin playing together.  While Ro tries TOO swear.
Video three: Julen and Husky watching from the side, while Julen Aries’ all over Husky.
Wait, so me and Julien are the same age and our bdays are 2 days apart! My bday is April 15th! That's crazy to me. Lol. Happy bday Aires!
6:33 that's so me and my mom
Why do I feel like Julien is slowly becoming Andy from parks and rec😂
Flossing at  the end LMAO
Quick jenna is gone, start knocking stuff off the counter and making messed
when are you guys getting married??
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIE!!!!! Thank you for loving our Jenna and always being so awesome and pure!!!!!
"We're just friends Julian!!" Relationship goals maaaaan 😂❤
Is anyone commenting on his real birthday? Lol 😂😂🤔🤔
...so are we just collectively going to ignore the fact that he misspelled his own name on the cake tho?
I love that you guys are vegan 😭💕 people like you encouraged me to start a channel :,)
Julian and I have the same birthday yay! Happy birthday 🙂🎉🤮
Ok... I have a great idea.
Cristine does your nails...
You do her hair!
its april 17 now! happy Bday julien!
Im sry but im crying at ur relationship i wish i was 32 i cant do anything right now
julien screaming "I LOVE U SO MUCH" to jenna as they dance like nerds in their empty kitchen is my new aesthetic
Julien has the same birthday as me on the 17th April!
currently waiting on these friends to get married.
JENNA THOSE SLEEVES MAKE ME ANXIOUS I--
I want to see more of cement 😔🤠
I want there relationship 😂😭
Can jenna please cover a bald cap and her face with rhinestones (or googly eyes) 
💎👀
"julen." i laughed so f***ing hard
If they ever break up ima DIE OF SADNESS
I’m sure someone has already said this but in regards to sliding cakes, you can use toothpicks! Just put two into the second layer and push down so it goes into the first layer.

There’s a “tradition” of kissing the cook if you get the toothpick in your slice which is cute and suits the both of you perfectly.
Bro you should follow a Binging with Babish video
I miss moq, can he do a jnj kitchen, Bring Back Moq!* please:)
When did 30 year lady turn into 32 year old lady!!! I feel like I missed 2 years of intros
happy bday julien!! i’m an aries too! ♈️
Can't you bake a cake once in a while to improve your skills? And make a video out of it😁
Did julien misspell his own name?
DO AN I WANT TO BE A PLANT VIDEO!!! Also on the podcast can you have julian try to describe one of your plants and you try to guess it????
can't wait to see what Julien is like when he grows up.
This video was rife with manic aries energy. When Julien aggressively sniffed the vinegar and then said 'that's disgusting' in the most defeated voice, I almost peed. Poor Jena just wants chill cake time and that boi is outta control!
i thought julien was like 40 lol
Hey my birthday was on the 16th
I came from the Russian voice acting channel, God, why did I think that Jenna has a male voice?


Ребят, я же не одна такая?)
That was one massive mixing bowl for a standard kitchen lol
Happy birthday Julien🎂🎂🎂🎉🎉🎉
If you mix julian and jenna into one human they would be the perfect mix of crazy and perfect
I've been waching her for more than a month and I just realized i have not been subscribed yet...
My mum's birthday is the 19th of April so on a technicality involving timezones, Julian is the day before my mum
I love when friends bake together.
MY BDAY IS ON APRIL 17TH
Soooo cuteeeee 😩😍
i cant focus on the baking i kept looking at her lip gloss
that is totally an aries cake
bright colors, leaning slightly, incorrectly spelled name, blessed.
Since y'all are 1. vegan 2. GF and 3. know you love some asian flavors thought I would share this cause it was AMAZING and pretty easy. We made it vegan with the Beyond Meat Sausage taken out of the casing and GF with Pasta Joy spaghetti and then Earth Balance for butter....https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spicy-sweet-sambal-pork-noodles. So good! hope you love it as much as we did.And Happy Birfday Julian!!
Why no one moisten the cakessssssssssss in these YouTube videosssss? goes crazy
the last two minutes brought me such joy
I’m turning 27 tomorrow so I thought I would watch this again. Happy belated birthday Julien!
If I could double like I would 🎉🌈😂
"You have three step brothers and sisters". How.
17:54 i see u peachy.. tryna get in the vid
a wild capricorn approaches to like the aries kitchen video
Tip if your icing is too soft just add more powdered sugar 🧠 = 💥
this was uploaded on my birthday aye
Why Are you older than my mom. She is 29
jvlen. ← the only way I want to see Julien's I MEAN jvlen.'s name written
I forget that juliens younger lol
Jenna: "babe that's not helpful."

Julien: "I do what I do and you do what you can about it."
My new life motto ^
haha I'm a university student but I work part-time as a cake decorator and this was immensely entertaining
*peach jumps on the island
Who else can’t wait for them procreate or marry 🙋🏻‍♀️ they’re so perfect for each other
#FriendshipGoals
You should do your makeup not moving the brush, just your face. X
Julien being a whole mood for 18 minutes and 28 seconds
Damn Jenna Marbles sounds like one of those New York/Brooklyn type housewives HAHA
Welcome to Taurus season.
Emmm, excuse me miss, but you misspelt 'friend' in the title. It's spelt f-r-i-e-n-d and not b-o-y-f-r-i-e-n-d. Thanks.
Food Network: Our chefs can bake the best cakes!
Jenna: hold my cermet
I know exactly what u sayin
I know exactly what u sayin
Who wants her to do a video where she just shows off her piano skills??
Aw... it broke my heart when jenna said that we're only friends
"how yellow do you want this?"


I seriously was expecting him to just say "Julien"
This is probably my new favourite video of yours! 

You and Julien have such a great energy together. I loved every second of this video. So nice! Relationship goals! Or friendship goals?! <3 

P.S. I am also a 32 year old ladyyyyyyyyyy :D
Julien is exactly 13 days older than me. Lol
Take a shot every time she mentions Rosanna Pansino 😅
It's April 17th today so happy birthday
no one: happy b-
julien: eats a whole bag of sugar
I couldnt stop smiling throughout the whole video
Happy late birthday 🎂👏
Watching jenna and Julien bakeing is like asmr for my heart
Jenna: "We're not married"
Me: "Why the hell not Jenna?"
I can't wait for the edits 

"Jenna baking a cake with a child for 20 minutes"
11:26 "Look at me go..."  Im peeling PAPERRRR 😃
TODAY IS JULIENS BDAY!! HAPPY BDAY U ARIES BUM
Im hungry...
I remember me and my mom made a lot of dough to make doughnuts...
We ended up making over 50..... I'm fat
If you ever come to Toronto, stop at Bunner's Bakery. It is a 100% vegan/gluten free bake shop that has the best baked goods including birthday cakes and red velevet stuff that i've ever had. I don't understand how they make their stuff taste so good you would never know its gluten free or vegan honestly. Bought a cake for my sisters birthday one year and my whole family said it was one of the best cakes they've ever had.
0:32 Julien looks like those bystanders trying to be caught on tv behind a reporter 😂😂😂 lmaooo
Who else just realized they’re 5 years apart like she looks so much younger than 32
Coming the day for your birthday bro happy birthday 🙏🙏
I have seen a lot of JennaMarbles videos, though I think this one is one of my favorites
Whaaaat Julien and I have the same birthday??? I knew I liked him for some reason.
Holy shit that “oh is this a video” part was hilarious
I read the title as just Baking My Boyfriend and-
3:26 it looked like she fell in love all over again😭😍
Am I the only one that thought they were the same age?




Just me?




Okay
Julie is the same age as my boyfriend
Patiently waiting for a Rosanna collab...
But Happy birthday 27 year old man. Your friend the 32 year old ladyyy seems nice.
That intro reminded me of Fridays with PewDiePie
i strive to have a friendship this good.
Happy birthday Julian cause it's today!!!!!
HAPPY B' DAY JULIEN
I love friends who can say "i love you" to each other 😍❤❤❤
Honestly I never measure for American buttercream because it’s so simple and it just depends on the consistency and flavor that you want. But like if you are making an Italian buttercream you gotta measure. Thanks for coming to my ted talk
Low key forgot that they're not married
happy birthday to Julien
Does that bowl she’s mixing in look UNCOMFORTABLY large to anyone else???
My birthday was on Monday! Happy birthday Julien!!!!
The Wall remains undefeated
Dying 🤣
I’m a self taught cake decorator. I became an assistant manager at a bakery when I was 19 and girl I feel you it can get tough. It’s also tough when it comes to the temperature in your house or work area. It’s really wild how much goes into decorating a cake. You did great! My first cake didn’t come out that good!!
"Julian's a catcher and I'm a pitcher."
- Jenna Marbles 2019
“Julie’s a catcher and I’m a pitcher”
(  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
I'm proud of y'all!
this video had no intro!
7:20 we’re just friends JuLiEn
0:58 I wish my Totally Platonic friends would kiss my hands like that. They're such friendship goals.
Did bon appétit start the « Baking school » after seeing this video 😭
Oh nooooo HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY!!!!
My birthday was the 15th
ok this might just be me but did julien forget the i in his name when he wrote it on the cake in cursive?
edit: nvm lol i just found someone else pointing that out sorry guys
“i don’t wanna make the top flat, this is a homemade cake”

4 min later

“IT’S FALLING”
Happy birthday Julian my birthday is April 16
omggggg julian has the same birthday asss meeee!!!
happy birthday julien!!
Wait! 😳 What does the vinegar do!?! I've never in my 31 years of life seen vinegar go in cake batter!
Yes beech! Mic'ing up Julen was an excellent choice.

IT'S ARIES SEASON BBY 😈
I didn’t know he was only 27
I LOVE YOU JENNA
You gotta use Crisco if you want really stiff frosting. It's vegan
Julian double dipping his finger in the batter made me unconsciously yell out "JuLiAnN-uH!"
Can u guys make the same recipe and film each other separately so we can see how a Virgo and Aries would make it? 😂
i have a sifter like that and i just shake it side to side while pressing the handle every now and then. it's a lot faster and doesn't hurt your arm too much
I love how she didnt want to cut cake after she baked it to make it flat but then complained about it falling over LMAOO
Happy B-day julien
You guys are so cute together!
Love that the intro to her videos has become like 

“32 YEAR OLD LADYYYYYYY”
Julien: ask me for the sugar ...!
           : AAASK me for the sugar ...!!
Jenna: Alright, can I have the sugar?
Julien: :  😗😗😗😗😗😗😙
well, I loved this part because as a child I used to name kisses.. sugar "but in my own language and it's actually cuter" and some times still does cause I think that this is the most accurate and sweet definition for kisses ...
so yeah, that was enough to save the video in my favourites list.
Julien gives me so much anxiety lol
MY BIRTHDAY APRIL 17th beeeccchhhh!!!!
R u dating i am so confused
“Thank you lord and savior Rosanna Pansino.” -Jenna Marbles 2019

😂😂😂
You are literally the best couple on the internet.
idk much about vegan cakes etc but before you apply icing decor it may help to chill the frosted cake first not totally just enough for the frosting to be cool.  With some embellishment icings and frostings you can also do that and it makes them a thicker consistency without altering the ingredient proportions
It looks like it says julen in stead of julien or is that just me
OMG IM ALWAYS SAYING MY MOM IS LIKE JULIEN DURING ARIES SEASON AND I JUST FOUND OUT THEY HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY WTF
jenna and julien: breathes
youtube video: number 5 on trending
happy birthday julen!!!! :)
Please do a tour of your kitchen 😫
aries season is alllll yearrr BISHHHHH
Happy b-day Julian!!
I love how I got an add for gluten free flour before this video 😂
Jenna, I've grown up watching your content. I've been watching your content since I was 12,  I'm almost 20 now.. in that time I've watched your content change and I've enjoyed it the whole way through. I can honestly look back and say there has not been a single Jenna marbles video I haven't seen or haven't enjoyed. Now that I'm growing up and I've got a home of my own, I love that I can still learn from the videos you post. Thank you for existing, you will always be my favorite💟
Oh wait she just answered my question
All of my birthdays 4:02
You made me a birthday cake for my birthday party on my birthday with birthday candles, happy birthday.
Last 2 minutes were amazing omfg
no one:
julien: guys this is my new knife
It was very satisfying that you were perfectly centered at the beginning of this video.
Who else came from Michelle's video?
these two dweebs were made for each other
No joke, my birthday is also on April, 17th. I gasped so hard when I heard his birth date.
~~*~*27 Year Old Man With Very Fastly Deteriorating Vision*~*~~
THIS IS A VERY ARIES BIRHTDAY CAKE LJFSLDKf
Happy belated birthday Julian
I laughed so hard! This was great!
If your buttercream frosting is too thin just throw in more powdered sugar
“I feel like the older you get, the more you don’t know shit” TRUEST THING IVE EVER HEARD.
Friendship Goals
Julien's love language is gifts and acts of service based on this video <3
Watch “Baking my boyfriend a birthday cake” and “Baking with Miley Cyrus” back to back. things took such a cute turn they was just friends n stuff but look at em now😂🥰
Julien: being good boy, standing still

Jenna: "This not Aries kitchen, okay? I know it's Aries Season, but I'm baking you a birthday cake. I want to do it nicely. I want to make you something nice. you're already stressing me out. " 😂
He's my birthday twin!  ♈♈♈
aries are stressful
My b-day is April 10 :3
I've never had a birthday cake lmao. Are they nice?
Your kitchen is marvelous
Love this 😂❤️😂❤️
17:55 was that peachy I see
Couple goals!
"I can tell we're not married by the amount you don't BAAAAKE!"
I have twice as much vinegar and I single humidifier or anything to do with it
orrr i have the same birthday as julian
Julian has the same birthday as my teacher 😂😂
Omg Julien has the same bday as me ☺
Jenna can do literally whatever video she wants to do, even if it’s watching paint dry, and she’ll get on high trending


Like wth she’s so cool and great and I love her
The frosting didnt work because your supposed to put the tip inside the bag and then put the frosting 😂😂
Jules makes me so happy that my man is a cancer. He’s still a man child, but like a much more manageable man child
Baking my *best friend* a birthday cake
Julien is 26, Jenna is 32 THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH
you two flossing together is the cutest thing ever
Wait so are they dating or not I’m confused
This was a day after my birthday :D
their relationship is so cute omg
Take a shot everytime Jenna says "Lord and Saviour Rosanna Pansino".
HOW did I not know they were vegan? ?!
i want to watch you all bake and ice cakes more 😂😂
this video wont play for me so im just gunna comment .---.
Wait....Julien is less than two years older than me. I think I'm having some sort of crisis. AH. Send help.
I thought Julien had a drink with him but hE WAS JUST EATING SPRINKLES
i made it just in time for his birthday even though i just now saw this video! that's pretty cool. happy birthday julien!
Chill the cake in the refrigerator before decorating it.
오와우
I read the title as baking my boyfriend for a birthday cake
This “just friends” thing is SCARING ME
Serve me 666, I crush your skull. #Promise drug #addict
What flour did you use??
Мой день рождения тоже 17 апреля
I love off camera mic julien
i love how jenna is actually genuinely distressed when her friend julen starts being an aries

hbd julien! i just realized we have the same birthday lol
Ahh my birthday is the 18th
They love each other so much.
I love you mom and dad!!
No one: 

Julien: pastel pastel pastel pastel pastel
Jenna for next time, if your icing is too thin add more icing sugar to thicken it, and when you put the icing in the bags put the icing tip in first so that you don’t have to hold it, and make sure you don’t cut the hole to big, I personally put the tip in and then cut the bag. 
Just helpful tips for your next wife baking attempt. 😋
0:32 me when I wake my mom up in the middle of the night bc I want a cup of water
The recipe says all purpose flour but I thought it was gluten-free, what flour did you guys use for Julien?
They need to get married wtf
No one:
Julian: coughs in Aries
Time isn't linear or cyclical its Jeremy Bearimy
JESUS that bowl is HUGE
Friends who bake together... stay friends
I need an update! Did the cake slide off did it survive. I NEEED ANSWERS LOL
Completely unplanned to watch this today, April 17th, buuuuuutt... HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIEN!!!!
Baking my boyfriend
This one is especially good
I wish I had a best friend like Julian 😫😫😫 But maybe not the Aries part because my zodiac is Caprisun 😌
I love this warm lighting. Its so warm and comforting. Very 32 year old lady approved
Happy birthday Julien Cause banana bread at work today? Hell yeah!
Why is julien always breathing so heavily
I love that Julien spells his name Jvlen on the cake🦄
#AriesSeason ♈️
Julien: pours pure sugar into mouth

"These sprinkles have no calories right?"
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIAN

“ this is my knife “
cool friend bonding!! happy birthday julien!! you and jenna are such funny friends!!
Happy birthday 🎉🥳
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIEN
I am so happy I live in Europe and we are on the metric system because measuring a cup of butter well that looks like torture and a hot mess
Jenna: is a super professional baker 
Also Jenna: uses a whisk to mix a thicc cake
85% of their relationship is jenna panicking and trying to keep Julien alive
Is it just me or does the cake say julen lol
happy birthday julien!
Watch how to cake it and you'll know how to make a cake because she literally puts it in your head how to bake and decorate a cake lol. Like one thing here, y'all really needed to put it in the fridge ahahahah but that's okay. I actually like the aesthetic in the end. It's so adorable.
🤠

this is Julien, his birthday is on april 17th. 
One like is one Happy Birthday. 🦆🦇🖤
HAPPY FREAKIN BIRTHDAY JULIENNNN
Yay another vegan recipe!
Do another prank calling video!!!
omg we have the same birthday!!
Can we just recognize the fact that this was uploaded at 3 in the morning?
Just storming into the comments like a proper Taurus.
Do people decide to go vegan because of how animals products are obtained and made for consumers? Or for health benefits?
My birthday is April 10 what is Julian's
The J&J B&B
“I can tell we’re not married by the amount you don’t bake” I WHEEZED
I need to find me a girl like Jenna she seems so laid back and cool.  Like if the stars aligned like I would love to try to collab with Julien or Jenna just for something fun
Happy Birthday 🎉
Julien and I share a birthday! I'm learning new things everyday!
the little knuckle kiss near the beginning!
every time she's upload a video im like ´´Thank God, I needed this´´
Jenna: "Would you like to be my Susan chef" 
Serisiously susan🤣
Happy birthday 🎂 Julien !!!!!♈ Aries season!!! Yeahhhhh!!!! Birthday month!!!!
I have never been more happy to also be a “32 year old lady” than I was after watching this!
I thought the icing fell off the cake but it was Peach jumping in the background
I'm gonna steal this moment and see it as you baking me a cake a week late
С прошедшим днём рождения, Джулиан)
MY BIRTHDAY IS THE 17th OF FRLIPPIN APRIL






REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
kinda mad that Jenna managed to make a beautiful cake on her first try but also proud
I'm sad Jenna didn't tell julien to "pipe down" when he said "pipe it up"
Juilen: 27 year old man with very fastly deteriorating vision
Jenna: (• _ •)

You guys are da best
Happy😁Birthday🎂🎉🎁
Jenna sacrificing monetization to make a meme review video for us is something gold
Ok so Peachy howling in auto tune was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard & I will buy that CD
I laughed so hard at the distorted meme I stopped breathing for like a minute am I ok
How is Julien getting secret links so quickly? Before they are even posted? The memes are coming from inside the house, J e n n a a a a   😱
Honestly I love the dynamic between you guys and Bush its like y'all are bros who admire each other from afar it's beautiful
I'm so happy you liked my Ghibli drawings! I really appreciate you included them in your video, thank you! ♥
I ate an edible an hour before watching this & it honestly made my whole day. I’ve been really upsetti spaghetti all week & this, this is just everything I wanted
12:27 "Everybody pop your p**y like this everybody don't poop don't piss""
Was I the only one who thought that was funny😂😂
I love how much Jenna is just... enjoying herself....
Can Bush come on the podcast?😂❤️
Jenna : "Hold your cermet close for this one"

Julien : * Causally hands over a cermet *
Ok but I need a mini compilation of julien’s banging on stuff song
Jenna can you do a video reacting to when you first got marbles, kermit and peach?
Do a video where you put on makeup but without moving the brush/lipstick/other tools just move your face

That ultimately lead to his death. I found out about it Monday. He passed May 8th. #TeamBrodie. Jenna, your videos are really lifting my spirits in these sad times <3
By far my favorite meme review😂😂😭

That’s a thicc braid!! Good job!
I've watched this video at least ten times and only now did I notice in Kermit Rides Into Town that Marbles is flying through the air by balloons when they first show the saloon
amazing.
Drugs are a powerful thing
Please watch god is a cermet by JnJ memes 😂
Why was a cermet rides into town so emotional? i fr wanted to cry XD
When Jenna started screaming with the music in the "A Beard is Born" I literally started cry laughing.

MAKE A SONG OUT OF PEACH SPEAKING INTO AUTOTUNE
I feel like peachy crying in auto tune could be a really good old videogame kinda song but alas I have No Skills™
Love these meme reviews beech!
Did she never react to "God is a Cermet"? I've been waiting for it for so long but I don't think she saw it yet.
My husband took our dog on a car ride and just got home. I yelled out the window very loud, “HEY! BRING ME MY AN CAERMET!” Little did I know, he was talking to our neighbor who is about 75 years old. I was embarrassed, but also idgaf either since I also repeated it twice after my husband said to yell it louder so our neighbor could hear. 💅
Woah! When did they teach Peach to sing like T-Pain!?
I just know jnjmemes is gonna make something out of peach singing
The song gave me goosebumps 🥰
Why did that Aries and Virgo song sound like a church song?
And why was a high key a bop?
I adore all of the animated ones. Omg talented ppl please make more lol
Bush is the purest boi and I love him sm

So glad I watched this till the end and heard Peach speak in auto tune.
I sampled Peach and she became part of my lead in a new track I just put out. amazing singing voice 👍❤️😂
Them dancing and hugging to a song about them being a virgo and an aries and getting on each others nerves but still loving each other and being together forever makes me cry
Do a google translate recipe pretty please. Translate a recipe  between different languages and back to English.
Is that originPC?!
Jenna, ive got a video idea for you after watching both your art videos and james charles makeup videos.

You should try either to paint with makeup brushes or do your makeup with art brushes. :)
Holy crap get that cartoonist out of the house and into the sunlight!

All of these were great, but I have to say my favorite was the acid trip clip when both of their faces and bodies kept morphing. Come to think of it everything was morphing.
autotuned Peach will now be the music that plays in my head when I dissociate for hours
and for that I am grateful
papa bless
Best meme review eveeeweeororor
I got this mixed up with the first meme review and I was more confused than necessary
that KAPPAS HAD 5 FEET?
Who else cannot watch the new video? :/
What is sleep when Jenna uploads right? Night owls WYA?
Peachy talks in auto tune: “let the memes begin, PEACHY VERSION.”
Yo she really just called Jacques from JonTron Jacksfilm's
Yeeesssss peach 👏👏👏
Or a /me/ review
We want to hear more of Peach's vocals tho! Such big talent.
Face melted after 13 minutes😋
Jenna, you are AMAZING!!! <3
I thought that was Dan Howell in the thumbnail but it was the drawing lady from the third video... Oops
Kermit looks like a bowling pin when you’re holding him up at the end lmfao

God, I love my parents so much 🤠✌️
JENNA!!! YOU PERFECTED YOUR BRAID! So proud of you girl, you look BITCHIN!

JENNA BEECH. I JUST NEED A VIDEO OF YOU ATTEMPTING TO PLAY THE CLARINET AGAIN. THANK YOU. THAT IS ALL.
BEECH THAT BRAID IS FANTASTIC
Kermit as an actual greyhound bus
Conspiracy Theory: Bush (JnJ memes) is Jenna and Julien's time traveling child.
Whoever made the animated ratchet salon is so talented. I feel like that's exactly how Jenna would look as a cartoon. Everyone really killed these memes. And those singers.. amazing 👏👏👏
WOW that pop legend at the end
I will pay good money to see a Jenna Marbles musical!
Peach in auto tune made my day. 😍
Jenna: "Julien went out somewhere and caught some sickness"

Julien: gets into pool fully clothed with an umbrella in the rain
21:55 wow that I call talent.
P.S. A Beard is Grown made me CRY
i tried to like this video like 7 different times throughout only to find that i'd already liked it basically instantly
You should prank call some place say like pizza hut and act like your the representative and say hi this is pizza hut how can I help you
their relationship with jnj memes is just, the best thing, ever. to happen. ever.
They stood so freaking still when that Broadway song mentioned marriage xD
Jenna! When it gets warmer outside you should try the 5 Minute Craft where you use bottles as a life jacket in your pool 🤣🤣♥️♥️
Omg lmfao put on captions 😂😂😂😂
6:50 play that on your wedding ceremony
I love how whoever made the western video knew that Jenna and Julien have both dressed up as cowboys at some point and utilized it xD
If  I end up making it through all of this..after all of this, and the "make a wish foundation " calls you.. Will you answer...?
you should pay the first person to make you a banner and stuff with their TALENTED ARTISTIC SKILLS WOO
Can jenna please cover a bald cap and her face with rhinestones (or googly eyes) 
💎👀
hey Jenna, is that a bad dragon sticker on your microphone stand?
A Beard is Grown and Peach "singing" in the end just made my whole day. I laughed so damn hard.
“Meme review” *clap clap*. Also I think peach likes auto tune
2:39 Beech. Thats Cermet, not Mr. Meeble.
Jenna make more cooking videooossss. I really love the things you guys cook

cermet👏review👏 2
I feel like it's high time we have another thoughts from a bathtub and unravel this mysterious mind
19:15 i literally jumped like marbles when julien touched him
If y'all don't have Daniel perform Aries and Virgo at your wedding...YA MISSIN OUT ON SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY. 
THANK YOU FOR THE MEME 👏🏻 REVIEW 👏🏻

I just seen someone make a wedding cake on YouTube and thought that was a great idea. Jenna’s vegan wedding cake w/ decorations lol
I cannot wait for peach's album to drop.
THE STAR IS BORN ONE WAS A MASTERPIECE
Please tell me that Daniel Ruffing and friends will be invited to perform "Aries and Virgo" at your wedding!!!

@2:39 
*Is Kermit*
Jenna: "AWWW! MARBLE!"
It's clear who the favorite is... LOL.
Animators are so underrated and talented
Please make an auto tune song of the dogs speaking 😂😂
jenna should do another 'best mascara to cry in video'. she missed out on my favorite black streaky mascara to cry in: Maybelline Great Lash mascara. the best if you're looking for black tears streaming down your face lol
Do the Harry Potter one!!!!!
I love how jenna is giving so much exposure to original artists. she appreciates it so much & it gives the artist a bigger platform ❤❤
Omg peach speaking in autotune made my f**** day. These peach and kermit are why i want an iggy🤣 theyre so funny!

reacting to virgo memes
Peachy speaking in auto tune is the best thing I’ve ever heard
Her braid looks good because she got a degree in side braiding 🤗
"Aw marble" she says when its clearly an animated Cermeht lmao
OMG THAT GIRL FROM THE ARIES VIRGO MUSICAL WAS SO FREAKING GOOD WHATTT
My ONLY question (even tho it’s beautiful) but why does Kermit have 5 feet at 4:38?
I Love that Cartoon Meme!!! Please get them to do all your shows like that we can watch them as re-runs!
I love how Jenna and Julien regard Busch as his own creator and not just a fan doing fan things. It is wonderful
The star is born edit had me DYING 😂😂
Wow, those singing people put tears to my eyes! So amazing :)))
Your first "meme review" claps, synced so perfectly with the time my lamp turns on in the morning that for a second I though you clapped it on but then I quickly realized that it's not a clap on lamp. Sorry about the interruption, I must go back to watching the video.
Peachy is a good singer
As A Friend I’m gonna say Excellent video today Jenna. I hope you have a fantastic day, night, & evening. Stay cool, stay awesome, stay swag, stay unstoppable, stay incredible, stay popular, stay great, keep having fun, keep being the best YouTuber, & stay strong Jenna. Keep up the good work. Enjoy your Monday.👑☺️👍🙏🏆

Did I drop everything to watch this? Yes.
Was it totally worth it and did it make my day? Yes.
Is Peach talking in auto tune the best thing ever? HELL YES.
youtube: the musical
Peachy speak in auto tune. Died
The effort the animator in the second clip went to with the hair colors is crazy, like that’s easily a few extra hours of work at the LEAST
this video makes me want to buy a house and live in a motel
Peach dropping a Cher remix next Wednesday slash Thursday.
13:45 - 14:02
"I'm nervous... AHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
I could watch Jenna cry laughing everyday for the rest of my life
they forget the most important vine: hi my name is tre and ive got a basketball game tomorrow...

Best video on the internet
Hey Jenna🙋. Can you do a remake of your drunken make up tutorial video????? Pretty  pretty please. A lot of other you tubers have made some but  you have the best and funniest one by farrrr... 🙌🙌🙌🙌
I kept trying to go back and like the video but I kept forgetting that I already liked it.
“Was that Donald Trump as a vacuum cleaner” BEEAACCCHH THIS HAD ME DYING
Ms. Weach sounded so gorgeous  while in autotune
J&J Memes is a legend!!!!

Content aware makes me so uncomfortable
Someone please make a song from the wailing peach did at the end. Someone good at editing get in that ASAP!
9:20 was g o d tier editing
Lol aw. The ending is like proud parents watching their son do stupid shit and love him that much more for it. So sweet<3
Pls turn yourself into a life sized roomba
We are singing shallow for my choir class HMU if you wanna come

M
  

           @
Aries and Virgo got me emotional
Peach in auto tune is literally the best part
So y’all should play the Virgo and Aries song for ur together forever ceremony if y’all have one
There are really talented people in our fandom and there's me... I just enjoy the memes. I just want to thank the people that put work into these.
I want that Jenna Marbles musical damn
THIS IS EPICC
]
7:00 gave me CHILLS
Finish that vine
Autotune Peach? I was very surprised when all three of my dogs were swivelling their heads like demented radar dishes at her "singing".
They loved her !!!
She is their superstar!
WHO ELSE WANTS JENNA MARBLES THE MUSICAL TO EXIST
You NEED to have him write your first dance song at your wedding. And play one of his originals walking down the aisle lmaoooo
TRASH 👏 DOGS👏
Jenna Marbles is the ONLY YouTuber. I refuse to hear any arguments to the contrary. 🧐
The Dead one is the best
That woman reminded me of Dan.
I really miss Ad man
I almost died laughing with his reaction
So when is Miss Weach gonna release her album because that song she sang was sick!!
the first video I watched of yours was my bf makes me cupcakes and I thought wtf... now I'm addicted
You know what I would pay to see? Like an animation or something of Jenna and Julien being the dogs and the dogs are the humans but they still act the exact same way they would if they were still dogs. 🤣🤣👌🏾👌🏾
Julien: “Jenna you mother everything”
Jenna: *julien don’t put that in ur mouth! julien stop!” 
😂😂
Wow! Just amazing, you made a day more colorful. And you've got a huge amount of subscribers. Oh, guys, please considering supporting my humble channel too. I would be quite happy if I will have 1k supporters too. Thank you.
The aries and virgos song needs to be performed by those people at your wedding. 😍👏👏👏👏
Can Jenna do an Art 👏🏻 Review 👏🏻
My dog ran away today. I miss my puppy so bad. I am saying this so that I can relate to someone if they are hurting. I love my dog so much and it hurts for him to go.
Kermit = needy child that cries for no reason while life goes by 😂
Um in the meme about the dog western im pretty sure those pugs were inspired after pewdiepies pugs
I want her doing an entire video talking in her « just for men » voice.
U gotta watch a Star is born
Can you glue several googly eyes on your face?
I laughed so hard at the content aware scale video I thought I was gonna fuckin throw up beetch
Jenna, I see purple polish on one hand and green on the other... 💅
literally gotta see jenna & julien perform one of the songs Daniel wrote
It is known that if you say “MEME REVIEW” you got to clap twice 👏👏😂
I really really want a ringtone of peachy speaking lol
happy Aries season
It doesn’t matter what video it is, but the distorted filter always gets me 😂
who else came after meme review 1
Out of curiousity. I searched Daniel Ruffing on Spotify and I wanna be tall is on there. I cant even.
The meme compilation of julien's nasty moments was ten times funnier only because of the odd voice changer. I couldn't stop laughing! It sounded like you were both talking under water and made the content of the video just pure hilarious-ness.
Pleeeeeeease recreate some troom troom hacks?
I had that nail color on a few weeks ago :)
Do a whole video with the voice distortion
Busch's reaction is literally so great 
Hes so excited and happy XD
There are not enough comments talking about Busch at the end. At least I can't find any, and that moment was magnificent
jenna pleaseee do a calling in sick to jobs i dont work at video
WE LOVE YOU MOM
in the aries and virgo song i was waiting for the end to say "...but for now we're JUST FRIENDS"
The content aware video had me in tears hgnhnfjhj
Lol my bff is a Aries and I am a Capricorn but  my mom is a Virgo and my mom and my bff are my favourite people to be with
omg please do a pet psychic video
U should review Grand illusions
We must protecc Jenna at all costs. The purest gem on youtube
Okay but did nobody notice Edgar and Maya in Kermit rides into town?
Never heard of you and you have 19milions of subscribers ? lul
Please do another prank calling people but we cant hear them
12:17 - 12:32 
Can someone make a song out of this 😂😂😂👌👌👌
The devil works hard,
But J&J Meme creators work harder
You should try resin demolishing art! I think it would be fun to watch and you and J would have fun have fun doing it.
i love that kermit looks high asf at 21:04
I LOVE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH BUSH
8:03 if that ever play on broadway i will do anything to see it
JENNA
YOUR BRAIDING SKILLS HAVE IMPROVED YES BB
2:37 Jenna saying "Oh Marble!" when it shows Kermit really shows his middlechild struggle
The aries and virgo song is amazing. But could you imagine if they ended it with "But weeee are juuuust Frieeeeeeeeeeeeeends"
19:40 I can’t stop watching this over and over again
This is completely unrelated to the video but i want jenna to try spray paint art 😂
10/10 would buy peaches' debut album
Why does peach crying in autotune sound like my house phone 😂
Only the holy one can do the clap
Green screen ME TIME #2 PWEEEESSSS
Beyoncé? 
I only know Peach.
The 'turtle feet' comment wasn't about Jenna's feet specifically, it was the Ghibli style art.
Aww I miss Jenna’s long messages in the click down thingy
i know they make your day better but they make mine better too lol
More like art review
It's your opinion. That's subjective. Then Jenna goes into her version of Khia My neck, my back 😂😂😂
Who else is here to see if Jenna still uses the squeaky toy intro? 😂
YES BU HEADBAND!!
So that one video based off of totoro ive seen that but the as i was scrolling through i found this a few videos away
I LOVE AUTOTUNED DOGE SO MUCH~!~!~!~!

I FINALLY realized... Jenna reminds me of Phoebe from Friends.
The vine one KILLED ME.
How have I not known about Jenna Marbles until a few weeks ago??????? I’m so binge watching these videos and laughing 😂 my butt off!  Also, the first five times she said she had a basketball game tomorrow I thought she played on a pickup league or something. Also, I watched her plant video and found out why my plant died. Also, her high school makeup pallet is my everyday makeup. Also, I’m so happy my little dog isn’t the only one that bites randomly!!! Also, that trash plate looked incredible!!!!
Waiting for someone to make “your opinion” a song
Omg I cry at the Aries and Virgo song is that bad?
Kermit: I NEED FLIP ING SUPPORT MOTHER
Jenna: GAWD    I AM NOT SUPPORT
i made a jenna and julien sticker pack on redbubble! if ud like pls check it out, i worked hard on editing (and even hand making) them. it'd mean a lot.
yo the auto ccs on this vid are crazy accurate?
The bar of Irish Spring stuck to Bushs' wall is priceless
Why is jnjmemes cute though...
Kermit have 5 paws in that video? just me?
Honestly Jenna has big mom energy
I tried to watch this in public as I ate lunch but as soon as 13:11 started I had to skip it bc I can’t cry laugh in public by myself

Lol  Jenna makes me laugh all the time❤️
I was in art class and we had to draw things that were around us. But the teacher brought some things for us to draw and she pulled out Irish Spring. I laughed so hard and no one knew why. 😂😂
I was not ready for Peach’s autotune lolololol
Jenna, do a becoming my zodiac sign videoooooo
Honestly some of your videos are so good and funny but most of them are boring af. I still liked you enough to subscribe. Jennnnnnnnaaaa (I sung that and it sounded good).
Make a tent for marbles
I straight up thought the lovely woman in the thumbnail was Daniel Howell’s body with Jenna’s face photoshopped in - 10/10 genuinely good look tho
MAKE MOREREEEEEEE MEME REVIEW
PEACH SINGING IN AUTO TUNE OMG
7:57 but they be only friends
Why so many comments about her braid I'm confused
Can we get a full video of the dogs in autotune? Cause I'm about that life lmaooo
Try pole dancing with Julien. That would be so funny
Dash nailed it
I just about shat my pants laughing at Peachy speaking through auto tune 🤣 Woke up both my boys who were snoozing, living their best lives, when mummy inhales tea, snorts it down her own chest & proceeds to literally roll about laughing AND crying! New convert enjoying the content 😘
That fluffy braid
the star is born edit and the aries content aware video had me CACKLING
I couldn't stop laughing at 13:07
Jenna: “he’s getting aggressive” 
Marbles: 👁👅👁
Jenna: sit
A completely cracked out Marble: i will now stagger backwards
Jenna: G O O D   B O E E E Y Y
Marbles is smart. He's trained his owners to give him treats without having to do tricks.
I love how happy and bouncy Marbles is now that all of his teefers are gone😍
I gasp loudly 
Husband: Are you watching a thriller?
Me: No, this dog almost learned how to sit. It's amazing.
Please do a ‘trying to get marble to eat off of different surfaces’!!
He (Need) Protecc
He (Try) Attacc
But Most Importantly,
He Don't Know Where He's At
Marbles reminds me of a really old man who posts the same pic on insta 17 times which is also his profile pic lol
Jenna: Marble sit
Marble: NO NO NO NO, NO SIT
Jenna: Marble all you gotta do is sit-
Marble: Tap dances NO NO NO NO DIS EASIER NO SIT
julien in true dad with camcorder fashion barely catching marbles first successful sit.
Jenna: Marbles sit.








Marbles: 
Jenna: sit! Sit! Sit!
Marble: coughes up hairball
Hey Jenna! I'm a professional positive dog trainer, and though I'm sure you've done everything already, I thought I'd offer you some praise and advice.


Your tone-- Fantastic! A nervous dog like Marble needs all that encouragement and all those GOODBOYS!
The consistency-- Good!  You're asking him for the same action with the same queue and being consistent with rewards!


There are a  notes I'd like to offer you, not only for working with Marble, but also for working with Bunny!
1. Pushing his butt down is actually counterproductive.  Like you said, he'll make the association of being physically manipulated and then getting the treat, not offering you the behavior and getting a treat.  This isn't harmful persay, but you will slow down your training process!
2. Put him against a wall when you ask him to sit.  You can see him backing up and up and up.  Adding a wall takes away his option to backbackback up!
3. We use a specific method to teach puppies (mostly) called lure and reward.  Take that stinky treat and put it on his nose and bring it up and back, without actually touching him, until that butt hits the ground.


Sometimes dogs just take a little longer to learn but it was SO lovely to watch you work with your puppies.


Good luck, Jenna! Love you babe!! ♥
I’ve come to the conclusion that you have the cutest zombie
Marbles: literally screams out of frustration
Jenna: That’s really cute!
“I don’t who this video is for.”

Me on my 6th time watching it
jenna: sit :)

marble: wild eyed, break dancing, tongue out ʳʳʳʰʰʰʳʳʳ
The zoom in on Marbles’ face around 7:40 was absolutely necessary
Jenna: brings food in a bowl
Marbles: ''wait, that's illegal''
Jenna: who's my smart boy?
Marbles: 👁️👅👁️
 Marbles is a national treasure and must be protected at all costs.
Marbles is so precious in every way and he brings me so much joy during stressful times. Thank you for wonderful dog content.
Jenna: marble sit🧸
Marble: *raises butt high in the air as possible*
Me: this is gold, and adorable💜💜
The patience Jenna has for literally everything is so fuckin wholesome
“Who’s my smart boy?”
“He doesn’t know the answer”
Jenna: “Sit”

Marbles: [does backflip]

Jenna: “...sit...”

Marbles: [discovers time-travel]

Jenna: “...🙄...sit”
Other youtubers:  throws shade apart of controversy 

Jenna Marbles: *trying to get my dog 
to sit for 20 min*
''here. peachy, up!''

paesh: YEET

she just appeared from no where im crying
This should be called “jenna slowly losing hope in marbles but not really because she loves him” 😂 I love both of them so much
These dog-centric videos give me wholesome happy vibes that I need on a regular basis. So please never stop!
Jenna: sit
Marble: 👁👅👁

I like to think that the entire universe was created just so Marbles could come into existence and live his life.
To all the people saying Marble is dead


Clearly he’s not and is very happy
Jenna: Marble, sit 
Marble: 🤸🏻‍♀️🤾🏻‍♀️🤺🤪
Honestly.... i hate small dogs.... but Marble...i give the pass. He is actually kinda cute

He protecc

But most importantly, 




He cant sit on his bacc
I totally want a compilation video of Meeble sounds, please
“Where do you find that kind of patience???”
“... I love him. I’d do anything for him.”

he knows how to reverse sit
head down butt up
i've been on a mr marbles appreciation kick lately and i nEED MORE CONTENT WITH THE SWEET BOY!!!! not at all trying to tell you how to train your dogs jenna, but something that has helped me train dogs that don't take to commands very quickly is to repeat the name of the command while you're praising them EVERY time, so instead of saying "good boy" i usually say something like "good boy, good sit" every single time they do it right. i think it helps build a stronger association with the command and their action because its associating the praise with the word. if you somehow see this, i hope it helps!! my dog isn't the sharpest tool in the shed but this helped a lot when i was training her!
Watching Marbles try to sit is like when you’re downloading a game and it restarts like:

0.5mB / 403mB
0.10mB / 403mB
402mB / 403mB
0.1mB / 403mB

like omfg nooo
I love when marble does the tappy tappy with his front feet when he's excited
marbles 3 brain cells
One is moving body
Second is putting tongue out
And third is trying to think
Jenna: sit, marble
Marble: but i must dance!
Every time I'm sad or upset or having a depressive episode, I come back to this video to watch Marbles stomp around and snort and yap and it makes me feel so much better.
Im like having major anxiety and this video is calming my breathing so thank u
Dear god I’d been staring for 10 minutes straight I took a sip of my tea and MISSED HIS BLOODY GOD DAMN SIT
She said “sit” 138 times. In case anyone was wondering...
I've never seen a dog like Marbles, he's like a cartoon character
marbles sits just with his front end rather than his back end
but it’s okay we love him nonetheless;)
Now that Marbles has his teeth out it’s like he’s a puppy again and honestly it’s the cutest , purest thing
I've watched this like 6 times because I absolutely love Marbles and this is by far the cutest thing ever.
Jenna: Marbles your the smartest boy! So smart! So smart!

Marbles:👁👅👁
So proud of this old man! I have never gone through such a roller coaster of emotions or have been so invested in whether or not a dog learned to sit.
You literally taught him to stagger backwards.
I’ve never seen Marbles legitimately get frustrated to the point where he’s making a big fuss
Things that make me happy to be alive: Marble barking, Marble’s wonky, aggressive stomp, and Marble glaring at Kermit for being too loud.
Jenna:sit 
Marble: 👁👅👁 tap dance
Is it weird that the fact you care about marble so much is kinda making me want to cry
Jenna: “I’m a GENIUS!” Puts hands up

Cermit and Peach: Puts up tiny little paws




Me: 
8:11 "He forgets me everyday" 10/10 cuteness but 0/10 intelligence
I was genuinely was so happy whenever he got close! It was like watching an intense sport! I'm so proud of Marble!!!
he attacc
he snacc 

but most importantly 

he forgets everything the moment you turn bacc
jenna: sit
marbles: backs up then stares at camera like he's on the office
jenna: gOoD bOy 💗💜💕❤️💘💛❤️💝💘💜💕💛💝❤️💘💕❤️💗💛💘💞💛💝💘💚💕💝💘💗❣️💖💘💛💗💝❤️
Julien: “Where do you find the patience to do this?”
Jenna: “I do this because I love him. “

So adorable.. 😍
Jenna: think about relaxing, Marble
Marbles: mother, I have relaxed exactly once in my life, it's not happening again anytime soon
I think we need an update in 3 months. See the progress.
This is the most alive I've ever seen Marble
Watching Marbles getting so excited makes my heart burst! ♥️♥️♥️
This is both the most cute and frustrating video in the universe
Jenna: sit

Marbles: ....*buffering*.....

Jenna: marbles sit.

Marbles: 

Jenna: good boy!!
Marble is probably the most active he's ever been in this video :3
22 minutes of Jenna asking a sweet potato to sit and scaring it by offering food.
16:30 oh geez I just screamed "GOOD BOY" too 😂
Dammit Marbles is too cute
Played this whilst I bathed my dog. Surround sound "good boi" makes helluva difference 😆
5:59 When you’re an 1 hour into the Netflix part of Netflix & Chill and she gives you this look.
Fyi if you partner praise with the command after a successful attempt it will help reinforce the behavior. So try saying “Good sit” when giving the treat. It really helps a lot!! ❤️🐶
Jenna: sit
Marbles: 👁👅👁
You are the perfect person for Marbles. im crying.
Marbles moonwalking to victory with his tongue out is modern art
Can I quit college and reincarnate into J&J's next pet please?
Jenna: sit 
Marble: bop it! Spin it! Twist it!
I think this is Cermets nightmare, a whole video NOT about him
Came back to this video to watch your stupid dog again lol
alternate title: how to train your zombie part 31
Julian should train him. Marbles legit just stopped what he was doing when he called him. Unless he didn't know who tf julian was 😂
I never thought I would watch a video of someone telling their dog to sit for 20 minutes, and enjoy it. Good job Marble
We saw another side of Mr. Marbles today and I love it 

No one: 
Marbles: 💃👁👅👁🕺
Honestly cermit and peach are very cute but marble is my fav hes such a good boy
Peach letting Marbles use 1/2 of a brain cell for 22 minutes
Has Marbles ever met Beanz Hart? Because idk about anyone else, but I for one think that would be quite the video
At 7:36 ... I couldn’t breathe and I had tears streaming down my face😂😂
Alternate title; Mr. Marbles being cute while Jenna says sit for 22 minutes.
i watch this video multiple times when i am studying and pretend that jenna is my lecturer and she is so patient with me. it is surprisingly very calming
Omg I've watched this so many times that my blind dog reacts to Jenna saying 'Good boy!!!' 😂
This is the most energy out of mr. marbles I’ve ever seen in like 7 years of watching these videos 😂
Maybe Bunny and Marbles can have sitting training together......
jenna: sit
marbles: TWO HOPS THIS TIME. SLIDE TO THE LEFT. SLIDE TO THE RIGHT bark
how can i get the thumbnail tattooed inside my eyes
see a goode boy everytime i blink
“Have you thought about maybe sitting?”
I don’t think Marble thinks at all
Marbles seems so much happier with his teeth out, it's so wonderful to see him acting like a lil pupper with energy. It makes me tear up a little seeing just how happy this lil guy is. I'm glad that the pain is gone
I cried laughing at this video skbeleneej
Jenna : Sit sit sit sit sit sit sit sit .. GoOD BoI    

Marble : 👁👅👁 GrUnT, CrY,
This is a wonderful video I can come and watch when I'm feeling down. Its already saved the day twice. :)
Marbles is the only chihuahua I will ever trust. His head is so full of empty I wanna cry
I didn't think I'd find a nice chihuahua until I discovered Marble for the first time.
What a little bean!
Steals my heart every time. UwU
My dog is the exact same!!
She’s smol
She is flippin adorbs
She will only sit on carpet/ soft surface
Jenna and Marble walk on stage
“Marble, sit”
he sits
crowd erupts
I taught my cat to sit on command






It took me two weeks.
Alternative title: "Jenna saying good boy and mabul for 20 minutes straight
"Telling a goldfish to sit for 20 minutes"
jenna: marble, sit.
marble: ... ok but what if i tap dance and cough for twenty minutes
My 65 lb pitbull also won't sit on hard surfaces. It's cold and hard on there butt 🤷‍♂️🤨
17:17 😂😂
Jenna: Can you sit? Sit. 
Marbles: Julian help...
Fun game: take a shot every time anyone says "sit"
I need an update on whether or not marbles still believes the hard wood floor is lava
Mr. marbles trying his best for 22 minutes
I've watched this beautiful video like 20 times, and 4:47-4:50 still makes me cry laugh
marble is so effing cute 🐶 💕
Bro with the crazy drama in the beauty community I will sit here and watch Mr. Marbles not sitting for 20 minutes. Jenna is such a breath of fresh air.
Bro with the crazy drama in the beauty community I will sit here and watch Mr. Marbles not sitting for 20 minutes. Jenna is such a breath of fresh air.
Julian : he’s useless
Jenna : he’s not useless, he’s a companion dog 
Marble 👁👅👁
This is the most lively I’ve ever seen marble in the two and a half years I’ve been watching this channel
Idkw, when i see Marbles on a video i start crying bc of how cute he is. :,)
Biggest win in 2019 by far
Is it just me or is Marbles just getting more adorable each year?
jenna: marble sit
marble: 👁👄👁
jenna: good boy!!!!!
marble: 👁👅👁
Nobody:




Marbles:is dog,struggles to bark.


No but I love marbles
Marble sit

marble sits

GOOD BOY!
AREN'T YOU PROUD OF HIM!


Yeah
I watch this video everyday because Mr Marbles reminds me of my dog who was 17 years old and never knew what we were saying and was an old man too😂 ❤️
SLAMS FISTS ON TABLE
YES, THIS IS QUALITY CONTENT
I absolutely refuse to watch a 3 minute ad before a video, but I decided to watch 20 minutes of a dog trying to sit.

Priorities.
jenna: marbles u can sit 
marbles: actually jenna i can’t sit anywhere i have hemorrhoids
I have a dog








Her name is Pebbles
Next up: Jenna’s Ratchet (but somewhat effective) Dog Training Service
At first I honestly thought he had to sit for twenty minutes
*marbles’ 3 brain cells working together for 22 minutes straight*
The video: 20 minutes worth of an adorable elderly dog called Marble being told to sit, staggering backwards, but cute as heCC, and sounding like a dying, yet cute, seal

My finger: Taps so hard that I break my bone 

Also me: I saw Marble. I clicked. I regret nothing.
Jenna- “Marble sit!” 
Marble-❓👁👄👁❓
its like 50 first dates 
          but its all Marbles 
with sitting
20 minutes of Marble is always a treat. Gosh, I love that dog. <3
Jenna: Sit
Marbles: ... 👁👅👁 ... sticks butt as high in the air as possible
He's juts very enthusiastic! He doesn't know why or what's happening but he's got the spirit!
I cannot express how adorable Marbles is. Whenever I see him my heart melts!!
I have never seen marbles so not dead before.. 

Ps you should do a teaching kermit how to exist without being a drama queen (even tho we Stan a drama queen)
i watched the entire video smiling from ear to ear
Jenna: Makes a video all about Marbles
Kermit: is about me, is me.
"have you thought about sitting" bold of jenna to assume marble is capable of thinking lol
but in all honesty i respect this dog and his accomplishment of not dying due to stupidity so much.
jenna and julien are the best dog parents a dog could ever have and i respect that
Marbles: 👁👄👁

Jenna: Just sit!

Marbles: nine
Marble's tongue has a complete mind of its own 😂
Jenna: Marble sit 
Marble : 👁️🕳️👁️
Marble sitting with the wrong side of his body for 20 minutes straight.
Googled it lol>>>
Some Chihuahuas are not big on sitting on cold, hard floors. They don't have as much fur on their hocks as some breeds, and it might be uncomfortable for them. -Practice “sit” on something up high such as a bench, your bed, couch, etc. – anything that's higher up than the floor.
1 like on this vid = 1 praise for marble




PRAISE THIS CUTE AF DOG
I would die for Marbles.
Jenna: Can you sit?
Marble: *shakes head*
Me: *sits in awe of cuteness*
This is like watching the screensaver for the DVD player logo bounce around but it never goes into the corner
He protec
He attac 
But most unfortunately 
He dont sit on that
Marbles is a big mood, just doesnt know what's happening, confused, and frustrated
Jenna: sit
Marbles:
👁     👁
     👅
Marbles made an ancient pact that he would never willingly touch his butt to anything other than a pillow
"Marbles it's not that hard just sit"
zoom in on Marbles: COMPLETE PANIC
Marble : mew 
Me: chokes on muffin
Jenna: marble do you sit

Marble: only on Wednesdays
Jenna:Can you sit?

Marble:Backs away. No
Marble is like if ren and stimpy were a single real life dog
the next trick you should teach marbles is to sit
Your patience is amazing! 😍
I’ll be honest. This was frustrating as hell. Absolutely adorable but really frustrating. 
I have a service dog and I guess I’m used to quickly giving a command anywhere and having my dog comply easily. This kinda brought me back to a year ago when I started my training journey with my prospect. It took a week and a half to solidify sit and a prolonged sit stay on any surface, with any distraction, in any environment, with any environmental change. From there it was heel, a recall from anywhere, down and down stays, stay, stand, center, watch me, paws up, place, and side. Then task training to mitigate my disabilities, a whole other story. 

Your persistence was amazing to watch and I wish you and your dogs many happy days. 😊
We have two Chihuahuas, we joke that one is the premium specimen as she's intelligent, poised and so well behaved.  The other is nicknamed Simples as she's the polar opposite.  Marbles has taught us that Simples is actually the prime Chihuahua specimen and our other dog is the oddity lol
But how come he doesn’t have good memory?
The elevator music in the background is what is going on in Marbles head 24/7
I literally just discovered jenna with this video
She my new fav youtuber💞
So proud of him i was legit happy when he sat down the times he did alone 😭
Is it me or does she vaguely resemble blake lively in this video?
jenna: think about relaxing marble

marble: *immediately panics*
Jenna: "Marble sit down." 
Marbles: (visible confusion)
I'm so vicariously proud right now he he

When I taught my cat to sit, I held the treat just over his head so he had to sit down in order to angle his neck to see it, maybe try this?
2years?! I have 3 chihuahuas and it didn't take even maybe half an hour for each of them...😂😂
This video is gonna fuel SO MANY J&J MEMES
Can u make a video where u make outdoor lounge furniture for the dogs so they can leisure by the pool

(Edit) thanks for the likes lads
Marbles looks so different with, what looks like, a haircut, he still CUTE THO!
Ok so what have we learned 
Marble is to Expensive for the wood floor
would've watched 20 more minutes of this absolute gold
Jenna: Sit Marble ♥️😍
Marble: Reverse sit
I’m afraid that If she teaches him to sit he’ll never get back up
He may not sit, But Marbles = Big Ball of Wholesome Fluff
You should just see how smart peachy is. Like see how far she can go ya know. Like set up obstacle courses and such and try to teach her hard tricks in small amounts of time lol. Also pls do more videos on marbles cuz even if they are just him failing we all love him
He protecc, he attacc 

But most importantly...






He out of whacc
As a fellow old chihuahua owner I relate to this on a spiritual level
He protect 
He attack
But most importantly 
He sit for snack
It’s crazy how invested we can get in something like this 😂

When Marble did the first definitive sit, I  just got so excited and said “YEAHHH YOU DID IT!!” and started clapping

This was wonderful and cute and big success 

Who is this video for you ask?

Me Jenna 

This video is for me
What we hear: Marble sit, siiit.

What Marble hears: Sing!
THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO <3 I wasn't frustrated at all, it made me feel very calm and I laughed. thank you jenna.
1:46 marbles keeps backing up I’m deddd
No one:
Literally no one:
Like not a single soul:



Marbles: 👁👅👁
Jenna: delivers a soliloquy
Marbles: blep
This is the most energy I have seen out of this dog since I started following you back in the angry blonde days
I love them, but I felt like I was in a tame "Blair Witch Project" because the camera kept shaking.  They needed a stabilizer for this one.
Someone needs to do one of those hilarious edits where they zoom in and write text
I lost it at the close ups of marbles face with his tongue dangling out lol
Marble being adorable for 20 minutes
Honestly, to me this is the cutest video on the internet <3
I watched all of this. All 20 minutes. I love Jenna and the dogs too much 😂
We protec 

We attec 

But most importantly we watch when marble listens
Marbles doing a little tap dance for 20 minutes
no one:
marble: is an olympic swimmer but can’t sit on a hard surface
he's constantly lowering the wrong end of his body i'm like just!! reverse it my boy!!
I’d say 10/10 success just because Jenna held his attention that long
anytime jenna says "good boy" my bunnies look up 'cause it's the same tone i use when they get praised
This is the most energetic I’ve seen Marbles in like 4 years
My poor dog hearing this video sat and stayed sitting then got annoyed half way through for not getting treats and bit my foot 😅
This is the most animated I've seen marbles and I love it
This isn’t frustrating for me. I love your dogs! :D
different hand commads, such as pointing straight above his head or motion...
next video- "Carpeting my entire house"
This is beautiful. I've watched this for five hours now.
marble sits
OH MY GOD ITS JASON BOURNE
I am genuinely entertained thank you :)
Omg, he is so cute and I love how patient you are with him! I have to admit this cracked me up:
“Who’s my smart boy?!”
(“He doesn’t know the answer...”)
Marbles: Backs up

Jenna: GOOD BOY DID YOU SEE THAT

Marbles: 👁 👅 👁
Marble sounds like a pelican/flamingo 😆😂
OwO
The battery is on 80% I don't think we have enough before he'll sit.
I think I can help, try putting the treat near his nose and then bring it towards the back of his head, so in order for him to keep his nose near the treat he will have to pull his head back and will have to sit down to keep following it, I hope that made sense. 🙂
Jenna: Marble, sit! Marble: ERROR 205 MARBLE NOT FOUND
Marbles' butt: jiggle 
Jenna: tHat was sO CLOSE
0:09 "You know what? This is my life" *cermit crying somewhere*

😂😂😂
It’s probably his tail trying to fly off his body
Marbles is so freaking cute
Marble has been siting,






He's been doing it backwards.
This is the most active I've ever seen Mr.Marbles. Adorable! And his little tongue hanging out, I can't
This is the quality content i subscribed for
This is the only 20+ minute video on youtube worth watching with no skipping 
thank u for this jenna
I think he's confused. I think that he believes his head is his butt. Every time she says 'sit' he puts his head to the ground. 
It's like a reverse sit. So technically he is doing it, you just don't understand him.
Marbles loves treats the way my pond goldfish love food


Me: "Dinner time!"
The next video is “talking to my plants and seeing if they speak back”
this video is for me beech! thank you so much ❤ marbles charms me like no other
Mr.Marbles is my spirit animal
Marble: exists
Jenna: GOOD BOYEEEEEEEEE!!!!
jenna: marble can you sit?

marble: sticks tongue out and stares at the camera like it's The Office
Yall need to show him a video of him sitting next time
There's just like elevator music playing in that dogs head and nothing else
Would like to know if he's made much progress over 7 weeks - also eyelashes 😍
Marbles may act like a goldfish but he is one adorable goldfish
Jenna: marble can you sit?
Marbles: 🤸🏻‍♂️
I distinctly remember your video titled “Marbles loves his treats” on your first channel and he did sit for you!!😂😂😂 he just forgot. He sat but you asked him to lay down and he wouldn’t 😂😂😂 he may be been on a soft surface though...
YOUR SO PRETTY!


oh sorry guys, that was meant for the dog
1:46 the dog in the back 😂
I love how he keeps putting his butt towards her so he can do the “push my butt down” trick.
This video low-key feels like "22 minutes of proof that Marbles is alive" I'm happy to see he's thriving
I legit can’t watch this video all the way through cause Marbles’ squeaks are so adorable and I can’t not cry
"You can't teach an old dog new tricks"
Jenna:
14:06 
I’ve watched it over many times. 
What is my life?
Marbles reminds me of an old person with Alzheimer's. Like he understands you want him to do SOMETHING, but he's not quite clear on what he needs to do
marble doesn’t forget how to sit he just forgets he’s actually standing up
Even if marblss cant sit, I still love him. What a GOOD BOY 10/10
rename this video "Me saying sit for 20 minutes"
He's very skilled at the reverse sit (front down, tail up).
Mr. marbles is literally the only chihuahua I've ever wanted to meet
Jenna: * tells Marble to do anything *
Marble: * furiously tap dances *
QUALITY CONTENT
“Peachy up” Peach jumps into frame. Paesh is such a smart little Cermet. Jenna your patience and your love for your doggies that you never give up, one of the many things I LOVE about you. I got just as excited when he actually sat too.😂💜
Jenna telling Marbles "I believe in you" constantly just warms my heart so much. We believe in you Marbles! You can do the sit
Jenna: “who’s a smart boy?”
Marbles: 👁➖👁  💭
I hope I could just once know how marble thinks 😂
Aww Jenna he thinks you're saying "speak" 😂
Marbles is unleashing his inner Kermit
1:04 i ThOughT iT WuZ tO bE tAlL?

I also just noticed how ThIcC marbles is😂💛💛
Jenna- “Sit Marble!”
Marbles- dirty gremlin noises
Hilarious vid 😂
Marbles is too f*cking cute!
I has news

Mr.Marbles is not dead

And in other news..

Marble.brain.exe has stopped working
Jenna: holds treat 
Marbles: 8P
Marbles: ⚫👅⚫
Jenna: GOOD BOY OMG GOOD JOB HONNEY!!!!!!
I need an update on this omggg I love that cute little boy
what no squeaky toy intro?😯
The floor is sitting 
Marbles : coughs hair balls and gruffs
19:23 with the pan to Kermit was just 😚👌 🤣
Marbles: 👁👅👁
Jenna: I love him & would do anything for him
I think every time he’s “sitting”, he’s just losing his balance and getting treats for it. What a life to live
I'm pretty sure half the times marbles sat in this video were because he moved backwards too quickly and fell on his butt and you know what? I think that's beautiful
2:54 I think marbels sits with the wrong side of his body
19:44 idk why but i keep on rewatching it
J: "Sit"
M: lays down
J: "I'll take that! Good boy!"
M: "Take what? Where am I."
marble, look at me son. i'm so proud of you!
I love how Jenna at one point says 'he's going to think the trick is for me to push his butt down' and later he starts turning hi butt toward her... at 16 mins in... I don't remember how to link that- I'm a 34-year-old gentleman rainbow

I ABSOLUTELY love how she's spending super-quality time with Mr Marbles without the iggies around. He's an old man... he needs lovins...
Oh my god playful Marbles is way too adorable!😍
I've never seen him so alive before
Jenna: Marble can you sit again??
Marble: Windows shutting down noise
You should try telling him "sit" in Spanish which is "Sientate" bc he's a chihuahua and I think he understand Spanish 
idk just my thought :)
I wonder if Jenna gave Marbles memory supplemental doggy treats, he'd remember better
Whenever people say Marbles is dead just show this video. Haha he is so lively and adorable.
0:38 Kermit's tongue reminded me of a CD ROM drive getting stuck while closing.
“Did you see him sit?”

Julien: 👁 👄 📷👌🏻
jenna: sit
marble: :P
this is the first time that ive ever heard marble make noise💀

julien being unimpressed in the background is hilarious
Marbles probably doesnt like how the hard floor feels on his booty.
Marbles refusing to sit on a hard floor when he does so with no issues on the carpet is like when a mom is trying to convince their child to eat tomato by saying "but its on pizza!"
Next video: Teaching kermit not to cry for 20 hours straight
Honestly, I’m only subbing for the dogs 🐕:))))
Awww his noises are more precious than a baby's laughter
He looks so confused awww 😭❤️
PLOT TWIST:
Marbles knows how to sit, he just gets confused by which end goes down
The title should be "Proof Marbles isn't dead"
Marble: * Does anything*
Jenna : Very cute!
For the first time in forever marble does not look dead in a video 😂😂💕
that´s the quality content i came for
I honestly just want to believe marbles thinks he’s sitting but he keeps mistaking his chest for his butt
Oh no, I just realized...

Where will Jenna find the time to teach Marbles to sit on the floor when she has Bunny?
Dog breed: Standing Companion Dog.
Your hair looks so good like that
So dense, but so adorable. Marbles is all heart ❤
jenna: marble sit 

marble:  👁👅👁 
snorts and chokes on food 

jenna: GOOD BOY MARBLE
My heart melted for every second of this video! I love marble so much!!😍😍😍
Jenna: sit

Marble: tries to speak english 

Jenna: Marble..sit😩

Marble: Coughs out his insides from frustration 

Jenna: Marble..🙄..please S I T!
Jenna: Good boy you can do it Marble sit sit...
Marble: 👁👄👁
Your very pretty :)   Marbles an adorable little doggy....Go Marbles!!
Jenna: Sit

Marbles: Moon walks 

Jenna: Good boy!!!
Things marble can’t do: 
Sit
Exact out of a fish 
Keep his tongue in his mouth 😂❤️
For his age, it honestly wouldn't be odd if he also has a hard time hearing.
"I can't believe my eyes" I can't believe I watched 22 minutes of this. I have no regrets.
Awww maybe his back legs hurt or something & he’s thinking if I sit I can’t get back up ! Lol so cute
In like the 6 years of watching i dont think ive heard marble make a single noise like that till now.
I would not be surprised if marble ended up saying "Golem" xd
Marble learned :* here push my butt again*
Ever since Marble got his teeth removed... that tongue is just everywhere
Did you know that you can tell a dogs IQ by how fast they can pick up a new trick?
Well this man here has been working on sit for his whole life.
Jenna: MARBLES SIT

Marbles: 👁️👅👁️

Edit: OMFG THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE LIKES
“brand new trick called sit” is SENDING ME
I rewatch this video regularly
Whenever I'm having a panic attack I always watch this video and it helps SO much.  Thank u for being the wholesome queen Jenna

At 14:15 I out loud said "Oh good job!!!"
7:44 
you’re welcome.
I got so excited when he sat even though I’ve seen dogs learn this in less than half an hour Marble just makes you feel his success is your success😂
The way you just scream GOOD BOOOOOIIYYYYY makes me very happy
Marble's cuteness increased by 1000% when he had all his teeth removed.
This video just made my day! So cuteeee ♥
"I'm here there's food," my thoughts when my bf's family invites me to dinner.

Julian: "he doesn't know the answer"
Jenna: who's my smart boy
Marble: 👁️👄👁️ cermet
Her dogs just have the biggest personalities 😂😂😂
You should classically condition your pups to drool at the sound of the bell just like Pavlov.
Omg imMa be 11 in June

i have narcolepsy so laughing makes my hands (muscles) weak and i honestly had to put this phone flat on my bed because i couldn’t pick up my phone anymore lmfao
The definition of insanity, trying the same thing over and over but expecting a different result
Omg I love this video marbles is so adorable
What if marbles just only speaks Spanish and that’s why he never reacts to anything you say
jenna: marble sit
marble: tap dances
those little barks just stole my heart
I'm so impress he's lived for ten years lol (it's not meant to be dark)
Go Marbles!!!!!
Also...Does anyone know what the background song is? I want to make my own jenna doggie video, but I need thay song to make it how I want it 😭
Jenna: Marble sit

Marble: 👁     👁
                    👅
Jenna: GoOd BoY
I'm sure others have commented but:


By repeating the command "sit" over and over again, Marbles has learned not to sit on the first command. I doubt he counts commands or anything, but it's seen as initially an option, as he waits for you to continue as you always do. It can SUCK. But if you get them something they really like (he's certainly motivated!) and say it, and then WAIT, he will eventually sit. The thing is, you need to have more patience than him, and you can't look away or start getting frustrated. He knows what it means, he just doesn't know it has to happen after #1. This may take many minutes, I wouldn't be surprised if it's 5-10, after 10 years of hearing "sisisitsitsit sit". And this would have to be repeated many times, but it wouldn't take forever.


Of course, this doesn't help with his floor issue...any chance he has long nails? they might make traction harder. Or he's just broken ;D
Jenna: Sit

Marbles: 👁👄👁
😘...go smoke a doobie JennA😎😉😆🤣😀
The quality content I’m here for
That's the most enthusiastic potato I have ever seen :')
I literally never got bored and clicked on this specifically because marble is my fav and I miss seeing him more 😂
marble this whole video : 👁👅👁
you know what I'd appreciate? Victoria Stilwell dealing with Cermet, Melon and the dead one that can't sit
Marble really is a sweetie huh. Just an old gentleman
When Marbles sat for that split second on the floor I was so proud
Seeing Marbles being so animated lately makes me so happy.
can u believe Marbles is gonna be 60 this year
i think you may have bought a slightly handicapped doggo.
HES SO EXCITED I LOVE HIM AND HES SO CUTE OMFG I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
Jenna: marble sit

Marble: DANCE DANCE TIL YOUR DEAD
I was laughing so hard i was actually choking on air and had to pause the video to take a deep breath😂
See?! He not dead
honestly, i'd die for marbles
I LOVE THAT DOG SO MUCH OMG HES SO CUTE I WANT ONE
you should lay out a bunch of different fabrics or paper towels etc, to see which materials he will sit on.
7:15 it sounds like marble says ‘I don’t know’
carpet: -
marbles: +
hardwood floor: -
marbles: -
Peach was like I am ringing the bell give me my treat now
Marble such a little grandpa I love him
Marbles when he had teeth: 
👁👅👁

Marbles now:
👁👁👅
I love that everytime paesh or cermit hit the bell marple would get terrified and back away 😭🥰
Jenna: Marble sit

Marble: 👁👅👁
This is making me cry 😭 he’s so cute
im so proud of him
I honestly think Jenna just posted this to prove that Marbles is, somewhat, alive.
Marbles is so cute, oh my god.
I watched your video from when you got marbles and then this one and I'm a crying mess
okay , i think that marble just doesn't have refined doggo motor skills because he keeps like downward dog posing so maybe hes just real confused.
I loved this!!
jenna’s nails are the colour of irish spring soap.
If they were at this for 22 minutes and 3 seconds and this is EDITED how long did it really take them😂😂
I've never seen marble this excited in the 10 years I've watched you!! He's always lazy and just lays there lmao, he loves him some treats!!
That's the most alive I've seen marbles be😂😂😂
I think marbles is choking on his own tongue.
i haven’t seen marbles this alive since 2012
You look gorge in this vid Jenna! Hair colour and style is lovely
Peach flew faster than my weave
i can’t believe i actually watched this whole video. and enjoyed it lol
Jenna: sit
Marbles: stumbles backwards
Marbles: falls
Jenna: good boy Marbles
Marbles has the competence of a baked potato with legs and a dopey tail but I would highkey die for him
no one:
marbles:
i've watched this video like 8 times. why? well idk
I watch this video when I need a lesson in patience for life.
this is the most amazing video on youtube. this is amazing
I swear Marbles is like 1,000% more alive since he's had his teeth pulled.
Please make a video just showing us all the tricks your dogs know plz
19:25 I died 😂😂😂
16:24 💘
He protecc
He attacc
But most importantly,
A memory is what he lacc
An update on my birthday)))
When Jenna says sit
Marble hears wag tail and put your ribs on the hard flor
marbles is a dog








with no teeth
this is the most alive i have seen marbles in YEARS what a good boy
Just watched 20 minutes of a toothless dog with dementia try to sit. This is trending, a I loved every minute of it 😂😍
Can we get an update on marbles and his relationship with hard floors?
Marble being adorable for 20 minutes straight
Hard surfaces are cold. Carpets and blankets aren’t.
This is the most energetic Marbles I’ve ever seen.
He may not sit for treats, but he will do a little footwork routine. Tappa tappa tappa.
Marble is just one whole extra chromosome
i wish my professors had this much patients
Someone needs to put marbles behind her so when she says sit he back up and eventually sits in front of her 😂
jenna : sit
marble on soft surface : sits

jenna : sit
marbles on hard surface : 
I think it's funny and cute that your greyhounds can ring a bell to get some treats! Kermit is a fancy gentleman!
I’m not a dog trainer, but-

peach yeets into Jenna’s arms
he's so frikin cute even though this is extremely frustrating it's also adorable cuz we don't often see marbles videos anymore kermit be stealin the spotlight cuz he's funny
I’ve never seen marbles look so....... not dead
Hey Jenna. We taught our dogs by putting the treat by or on the top of their nose to get them to tilt their head up when you push their bum down. 🤗 This was cute though. 😄💕 PS. I think try YouTube's videos on dog training because I know you rely on tutorials to get through life (same). 😂
Can we get a marble sit update after you guys get back? I love this little lad!!!
me before watching: idk this is probably gonna be boring
me halfway through: COME ON MARBLE!! YOU CAN DO IT!!! YOU BRAVE BOY!!!
lol, this doggo has his human very well trained to give treats XD
5:42 me watching my friends slowly leave me
Marble:no,I no sit

Jenna:sit,sit,sit,come on marble,come on 

Marble:*sticks butt in air*

Me:why he so cute 

Marble:👁👅👁


Me:*dies* 


Marble:👁👅👁

Marble:👀
             👅





Sorry if I made a mistake(this is cringeeeeeee) 🐕🐕
Those kind of dogs are actually really stupid. A friend had some and they tried to teach them tricks it took like 4 years to tech it just a few tricks.
I've never seen Marble move so much in one video... or ever.
Mr Marbles is the cutest little pupper ever!
Marble: Jokes on you. I'm faking dumb. I got treats every day for 2 years. lool Marble must be a genius
Lmao @19:27.
maybe he has arthritis in his bones and sitting on hard surfaces hurt worse then just standing??  a good way to test is to put soft pillows in the places you mention he has to stand and if he still chooses to stand rather then sit on the soft you gave him it might give you a insight on if its his body or mind thats making him not want to sit on hard surfaces
Jenna: I'm sure not many will watch...
Everybody : #2 on trending
is that thing alive?
Do u guys still have ad? U guys never mention him but if u do still have him u should do "making tiny things for our hamster 3" ❤
I love this video so much 😭
9:27 MARBLES STAYED SITTING WHILE GETTING A TREAT AAAAH
Jenna: sit 
Marbles: fiesta salsa quinceañera baila 💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻
Edit: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR 1.2k
i didn't know i needed this video <3
I don't know why but 4:47 to 4:50 made me laugh way more then I was supposed to 😂
THEM HITTING THE BELL 🥰🥰
THEM HITTING THE BELL 🥰🥰
A video dedicated to trying to get marbles to sit still, yet he’s moved more in this video than he has in every other video combined
Jenna’s nails are the colour of Irish Spring in this video...





Maybe that’s why Cement was screaming
This is actaully kinda sad when you think about it.
My chihuahua only sits on carpet too!!
Kermit looking through the window is a MOOD
Jenna: Have you thought about maybe sitting? 

Marble: 🤠❓
This is the most alive I've seen Marbles
He just makes my heart so happy.
I wonder if visual commands would help? they're usually for deaf dogs but can be helpful for all dogs
MARBLES SLIDING BACK AT 3:09 GOT ME SO BAD SODBWOSBWOSB
Jenna: siiiit
Marble: hovers his butt over the floor without sitting for half a second
Jenna: GOOOD BOOOYYY DID YOU SEE THAT??!?
jenna: sit
marbles: 👁👄👁
i love marbles with all my heart
this is the most wholesome, marvelous video on this cursed website
I cheered everytime he sat on the floor lol 🤗
Those dogs speak Spanish. 'Canicas Sentar'
19:47 OMG cermet is so dumb.
Omg my Chihuahua is the SAAAAAAMEEEE
Ok as I watch more, your dog needs a short bus helmet
he's so cute his body is literally the size of a potato oml i can't-
I love how he doesn’t really understand but he’s trying his absolute best
this is the cutest thing that i have ever seen. thank you
14:07 👏👏👏
i would fight god for Mr Marbles
marble just has one very confused brain cell bouncing around in that empty lil head 😂
I swear my old chihuahua and Marbles are kindred spirits... he is EXACTLY like this with training😜 he is somewhere between 17-19 years old and only knows sit, bark, and turn-around.
He’s so happy and I love it
Poor marble is so derpy. So cute
maybe try something between carpet and wood floor. like floor with velvet on it or something.
Jenna: Marble sit
Marble: 👁👄👁 🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🤸‍♀️🤾‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤾‍♂️
why did I clap every time he sat
Did Marble pupper have a stroke?
Dude I don't even care how ling the was I love marbles!
That’s the most alive your gonna see marble be
Marble does a half sit 

Me: screams at the top of my lungs
My dog and I were cheering mr. Marbles on lol, my dog was entertained by mr. Marbles lol
i would not watch this kind of content from anyone else BUT her.
Third time I’m watching this. I ❤️ Marbles
Jenna: Sit
Marbles:AAAaaaAAAaaaAAA
this is the most alive that I've seen marbles be...EVER
I feel like marble is me in school 😂
This is amazing when you have anxiety
19:45 Cermet is Nasty boi
mobol has exactly 1 and a half braincells , and they all collectively  gather to perform the exact actions he keeps reapiting in this video, thats it
It's been 6 minutes and my cheeks hurt from smiling so hard. Marbles is so cute. He's such a special lil boy I love him. Good boy.
What kind of dog is he?



Oh wait
but like have you ever thought.. maybe he just doesnt want to sit on a hard surface
Juliens camera handling today was not the best.
Jenna: changes shampoo
Marbles: Who is she?
Jenna - sit
Marble- got it, time to give her the ol razzle dazzle
i thought watching marble try and sit for 20 minutes would drive me crazy but it turns out i can watch marble do nothing for literally hours and still be entertained
This is the most alive marble has looked in a long time 😂
No one: 
Literally absolutely no one: 
Someone in the comments who needs attention: 'as someone who has worked as a professional dog trainer......'
The satisfaction level of Marble sitting on a hard surface is equivalent to the DVD logo hitting the corner of the tv
marbles' tinder bio:
can sit on soft surface
long tongue
good gagging skills
no teeth (good for kiss + lic)
am alive
Ok but I genuinely want to know, is it like a behavioural thing?? Or maybe a psychological situation?? Any expert animal trainers please explain
How do you not just give in and melt 😭😭 It's too cute!!
I love his enthusiasm
jenna: marble, siiiiiiit 
marble: screeches
ever since Mr Marble got his bad teeth out he’s been so much more energetic like...my heart is saying ✨💥✨💥✨
Idk why but when you said you would do anything for him I teared up. And at the end when you said to 10 more years ❤ I have a chihuahua mix and he's only just over a year old and just learned how to sit.
can I just say how much I enjoy how Julien shoots her vids?
Marble is so freaking cute!!!!
what the frick this didn’t come up on my subscription thingy
This video needs a slight title change...My Chihauhua trying to convince me to give him a treat for downward dog pose for 20 minutes. 100% completion rate.
So goddamn cute.
marble: floors are for eating not sitting!!!!
Back him into a corner- when his but hits the wall it’s instinct to put it down. (NOT IN A THREATENING WAY LOL)
I don't know if Marbles has four years left lol
Jenna: “Marbles sit?”
Marbles: Whine Cough Bark Sneeze
Jenna: Looks into the camera like she’s in The Office
Chihuahuas are like 1 evolutionary level above a rat.. they're cute but so goofy, and slightly slow 😂
This is so cute! 
My chihuahua only really responds to hand signals.. or responds more to signals than vocal commands lol And chihuahuas tend to be harder to train so I understand the struggle!
film marbles for a whole day please 🥺
I love this 😂❤️
This is the most alive I’ve seen Marbles recently.
Best👏20👏Minutes👏Of👏My👏LIFE!
LOL Cermet at 19:26 hahaha!
I taught my 14 year old dog how to put away his toys in two days. Marbles must have a learning disability
Hey do you train dogs if you really good with him you have a lot of patience
I just need to make sure that there are scientists working 24/7 in a lab somewhere to make sure that Marble lives forever.
I read "chihuahua" as "chinchilla" and the whole video I was thinking "that's not a chinchilla, that's a dog".
Welp they do say that you cant teach an old dog "new tricks"
My dog won't do anything 

He just stares 

I tried to teach my grandmother dog how to sit but now he only sits with a certain hand signal that I forgot which the hand signal was by complete accident
for some reason this is the content i ask for
Damn Virgos really be out here with INFINITE patience huh
Marble is the cutest dog
You guys should get some carpeting, it's so much easier on the dogs because it's not slippery and hard. This was beyond cuteness 😘😘😘
His tounge is touching the floor more than his bottom is...
this is the most i’ve seen marble move in 4 years of watching your channel.
19:25 
Jenna- My mom
@
Kermit- me
Marbles bark sounds like a pikmin
Jenna: Who’s my smart boy ?
Julien: He doesn’t know the answer 😂😂
I have to repeatedly come back to this video to make me feel better. I genuinely enjoy any video you decide to release
Why is Marbles the cutest thing ever... and how does he eat with no teeth? So many questions...
I mean 
If you think his head is in his butt he is sitting.
Lol you cannot train a chi they train you .hes adorable !! Chis are the best i miss my coco so bad .
PLEASE TRY THE 6D HAIR EXTENSIONS!!!! CAN YOU SHOW US IF ITS A GOOD IDEA OR A BAD IDEA
Marbles sits with the wrong end of his body when he’s on the hard floor
Marble Proves He's Actually Alive for 20 Minutes
The art of manipulation.
Marble is so freaking cute
My dog only sits on soft surfaces too. Any genuine advice to get him to sit on a wood floor? Most of my house is wood floors and I want him to be able to chill.
But can we admire Kermit the first minute of the video ??
What Jenna says: "Sit"
What Marbles hears: "Cha Cha real smooth"
in 10 years he might start decaying
I’m impressed by the amount of patience you have. 0.0
“ It’s like talking to a goldfish” 😂😂
Am I the only one who thinks jenna looks genuinely BEAUTIFUL in this vid
This is: 
A) The most alive Mr. Marbles has ever looked
2) Bringing me so much joy. 
Thank you.
I never thought I would be watching a 20 min video about a dog trying to figure out how to sit on the floor...
when I read the title, I legitimately thought that it was a video of trying to get her dog to sit for 20 minutes straight but what I received was much cuter 😍💕
This video should have been called Marbles not being dead for 20 minutes straight
I actually have a Chihuahua that does tricks, but I think it´s important to say that he doesn't look as a Chihuahua, he almost looks like a mini Labrador (idk how to translate this breed from Spanish, maybe Retriever idk :c) with short hair, and the double of size from a normal Chihuahua, it´s funny because his parents do look like cute little Chihuahuas, in his litter there was another big/weird Chihuahua and two little ones hahaha
This is a video of a woman trying to get her dog to sit for a whole 20 minutes. This got to the top of the trending list almost instantly. I love how loyal we are to Jenna
The word sit has lost all meaning. To Mr. Marbles and me.
HAHAHAH the bell omg love u
My dog Rex, a huge weimaraner, also will not under any circumstances sit on a hard surface and will only sit on carpet
When he almost got it at 12:00 I legit got excited 😂
jenna: marbles can you ~sit~?
marbles: 👁👅👁
can we have a part 2?
Kermit looks like he wants to jump off a dumpster
This video is marbles 50 first sits.
I never realized they lobotimized marble
I’m convinced Julien was one of the cameramen for The Office😂
Maybe marble and bunny will start learning at the same time
Give him the bag just give it to him he is too cute.
can we get an update on this thnx
Aww Marbles ❤
Jenna is actually the most patient and loving person in the world.
MARBLES CONTENT ♡
Proof marbles isn't dead to those who doubted he was alive. 😋. Much love to the dogs, Jenna and Julien.
He is picking up his brothers bad habits - crying
👁   👁
    👅
Marbles isn’t dumb, he lives in the moment. He forgets about the past, lives in the present, and looks to the future. Sitting is just something in past, so he doesn’t do it. I think this makes him the smartest
Jenna: sit
Marble: (breathe)
Jenna: thats cute but sittt
I think this is most I've ever seen marble move.
I loooove this video!!! I have a 6 year old chihuahua and he is soooo much like Marbles. He won’t sit anywhere unless we’re on a carpet, couch, or the bed! I feel like he must be so uncomfortable 😩❤️
Sometime in the near future please do a pet psychic comes to my house. I need to know what Kermit thinks about.
next video is 'putting carpet all over my house so mr marbles can sit'
Jenna: Marble siiiiiiittttt
Marble: 👁👅👁
we need to know what lashes you are wearing 😍
At 6:00 marbles made me laugh so hard with his tongue out
Take a shot everytime marbles sits.
This should be called “Jenna positively affirms her Marbles for 20 minutes straight”
this has to be the video where marbles is mostly not dead and in another dimension
13:53 Marbles me in math class
Jenna try using a clicker with marbles and click it immediately after a good behaviour then reward with a treat. A clicker will help him understand which of his behaviours is favourable
My Dog Is Sitting for 20 Minutes Because She Is (Yeah My dog Is a Girl) Sleeping
He protec
He attac
But most importantly,
A memory is what he lac
I definetaly thought she was trying to get him to sit for 20 minutes as in stay in thst position for 20 minutes and half way through the vid I was like, how are they going to last 20 minutes?! He wont sit for two seconds. I feel dumb
lmao he really doesn't want to sit! He knows what he has to do but then gives a sideways look like "can I get away with not doing it and still get the treat?" I don't think he's as stupid as everyone says - LOVE YOU OLD MAN MARBLE, U SUCH A GOOD, SMART, FEARLESS BOY ❤️
How can I apply to make the subtitles in Spanish for your videos. I just want my friends and family to enjoy them as much as I do.
“ok marble that’s really cute now



      S      I      T”
Bro he’s just confused because “sit” sounds kinda like “walk backwards and wag your tail” so he’s just getting them mixed up :///
My chihuahua is jealous of all of marbles treats now 😂
16:00 literally gives her his butt to sit him down
status update, did he forget?
Jenna: Who’s my smart boy?

Marble: T R E A M T S 👁👅👁
This is both the best and the saddest thing ever HES CRYING but I feel like he’s only making noises bc the iggies make noise and get fed. What if he thinks she’s saying speak omg
that zoom in at 7:43 had me rollingggggggg
He is that one grandpa who doesn't want to go to a retirement home
I love the little scoot back he does every time he tries to sit 😂
remember the video where the guy dresses like a giant version of his dogs favorite toy? please do this diy it
You should do a video on clicker training your dogs. I bet Marbles would learn to sit 10x faster if you could click in the exact moment his butt touched the floor! I want to see what you could teach the other two as well!
tell marbles he cured my depression
laughed so hard i had spots in my vision, i love these dogs
This is the most alive I’ve ever seen marbles
To be fair, not wanting one's anus touching a cold hard floor is understandable.
this is the most active i have seen of marbles
Hey Jana have you ever heard of clicker training when you use the little clicker button and it gets their brain to think that the clicking sound is a good thing that way you can have an exact time frame when it's a good time when it's good activity so is his sitting is like a millisecond long you can cook it right when he sits down and he won't think getting right back up is the thing you want him to do cuz that's what he thinks right now is getting up is the thing you want him to do (ps sorry for lack of punctuation)
marbles is my fav
..have you considered getting carpeted floors?
“I don’t think he thinks”

His face shows it all....



Thank you guys so much for the likes 💚
👁👅👁
Does anyone see the legitimate joy in Jenna’s face when marbles barely touches the floor.😂
This made my day😍
I LOVE Mr. Marbles
Can someone make a list of when  Marbles sat
Marble's little tongue hanging out is so cute I could cry
"I'm here...... there's food...... turn on the cute" story of my life
this is the most I have ever seen marble move and I love it! go on marble!
I’ve never been more entertained I was literally clapping every time he sat
i just realized that all the whining marbles was doing made me think that he'd learn to talk before he sat down on a hard surface of his own volition
i need a marbles forgetting julien exists for 5 min straight vid compilation
I need a marble in my life
if i was reincarnated , i would be marbles
I am watching this for a 100th time and I don't regret a second of it xD
I wish I had Jenna’s level of patience 😂
“I don’t know who this video is for” 


US Jenna. US. You, me, everyone.
Jenna said “sit” or “sitting” 148 times in this video. Julien said sit or sitting 2 times. Those words were used 150 times. Curiosity got the best of me so I had to count it lol
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIT, A MINUTE, JUST TAKE YOUR TIME, THE CLOCK IS TICKING, SO SIT.
I WANT MOREEE MARBLESSSSS
Marbles is so unbelievably loveable and adorable when he is excited
jenna is the most unproblematic and wholesome youtuber we will continue to stan
I know this is kind of late in the game for you all, but have you tried just putting Marbles' ass on the floor for ten or twenty minutes straight multiple times without treats? He knows how to sit, he just won't do it on a hard floor. If he becomes comfortable with his butt on a non-carpet surface, I'm sure that would probably make your life (and Marbles') much easier.
Snapping and hand gestures help them more than words. I have a Rottweiler and all I ever need to do is snap and point and she immediately knows what to do.
Try pushing his butt down and saying sit over and over then when he stands up reward him and say good boy that way he knows that when you say sit you want him to put his butt down
THAT DOG SOUNDS LIKE A ZOMBIE. THAT SOUND HAS ME WEAKKK
"Actually Megan, I can't sit I have hemorrhoids."
jenna will be such a good mother oml
the only time he has to chill, and he's the most alive I've ever seen him
Is the wooden floor cold? Marbles might not like the cold, hence why he will sit outside or on the carpet but struggles when it comes to the floor xx
Marbles lost his marbles
Put Kermit Peach and Marbles in green suits so only their faces are showing and put them in front of a green screen
No offense but I would die for Marbles
this video makes me want a real chihuahua (or dog in general) even more, the only dog i have is my nintendog bacon...lol
Such a good mommy
YAY MARBLE !!!
i feel like jenna gets prettier with age like she is glowinggg in this vid
Cermet+marbles=me as a doggo
Soooo relatable omg
This made me so happy 😂😘
Next video 
Teaching marble to eat of a plate ..... Plz
Jenna: Can you sit
Marbles: 🌚👄🌚
Jenna: That’s cute that’s not sitting
Marbles: ❤️👅❤️
Talked about basketballs but didn’t mention her game tomorrow 0/10 very disappointed.
The lowest point in doing your hair is coming to the realization that your face is the problem
Jenna: Even if I had a person with a real head of hair, it would-
Julien: ...I'm a person

😂😂😂😂😂
“Loose braids are the Fit-Tea of hair.” 


- Jenna Marbles 2k19
“I look like a Jesus” 🤣 
“Look at me. Don’t look at me anymore” 😂😂😂
"Is my face the problem?"

Girl I felt that to hard
"Put some whip cream on me because I'm an apple pie." - Julien 2k19
Jenna: "Julien, Imma need you to put on that wig for me"
Julien: "You got it"
Such an amazing amount of support right there XD
I need a Jenna’s ratchet salon video featuring SimplyNailogical
Someone explain why Jenna doesn’t age
Jenna: "Why does everyone's look so good and then mine looks like I got hit by a bus?"
Julien: "Well, not a bus, just a bicycle."
"is my face the problem?" is too relatable
no ones gonna talk about how julian said jenna looked like a bike lock after the first one
When you want to make the braid more voluminous, you only need to stretch the edges, not stretch the braid completely. Then it does not turn into a disheveled and keeps its shape :-)
Hello from Ukraine!! :-)
Remember when you said that people go to YouTube so they can see people being people? You are the best version of that. 

Thank you for being a (very honest, kind, compassionate) person.
Me:this is the best kind of self care. *sits in a bubble bath watching Jenna marbles for 2 hours
I appreciate her videos so much ... they're one of the only things that can calm my anxiety attacks because she has nothing but good vibes . I know she might not ever see this but girl if you do, thank you. From the bottom of my soul thank you for just being yourself.
”bounce me mommy” -Julien 2k19
this really should be titled “jenna marbles nearly crying about hair for 19 minutes”
Speaking of doing your hair..... YOUR HAIR IS SO LONG AND LUSCIOUS I'm proud of you for growing it out good job on making all that hair by yourself
Just for the record, I really enjoyed Julien's man-bun era.
13:33 Outrageously long hair, you say? Hmmm
*hands cupped around mouth *
Oh, Cristiiiiine!!!
my braid tutorial would include GIVING UP AND CUTTING MY HAIR SHORT AGAIN
I just realized Julian has the same voice as Nick from New Girl and I can't unhear it.
Honestly, this is the most relatable video on YouTube
Cristine said she’d trust you with her hair so you should make a video where you do this but on her lol Jenna’s ratchet salon ft simplynailogical?
Jenna is so fucking real I love it. I’ve literally struggled this exact way lol. I think when they stretch the braids it’s super voluminous, like hair spray and teasing. And they make the braid tight as hell first and push the hair tie up. I think lol.
Safiya, Cristine and Jenna Marbles should do a collab some how. It would be great!!!!!!

Like so Jenna can see👍🏻❤️
"It feels like you're not actually doing too bad..."
Jenna has a rats nest on the back of her head
“Look at me”
“Don’t look at me anymore” 😂😂
Julien: heres a lobster with some butter on the side
Jenna: ITS NOT A LOBSTER!!!👿😡
lmao😂😂
Lmao Julien looks like Garth from waynes world in that wig
Hi! To fluff the braid you need to pull the strands from the sides gently. in the middle not to touch. Hello from Russia Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk🤟
"You dont- you dont really look like a basketb-" sees julien "oH My gOd
Braid is definitely a good style for your basketball game tomorrow.
Me: Thinking about how Jenna's hair looks so clean

Jenna: "my hair is dirtier than I'd like to admit"
Your hair is very thin, fluffing and braiding would be difficult unless you do it slowly and with a hydration mist to add shine and control while reducing frizz. Adding warm tones highlighs and lowlights would also make braids look fuller and more complex. Hope this helped Jenna! Have a great day!
They probably have thicker hair than you do.  

You are such a creative and down to earth human being. I watched you a few years ago on Larry King and I was really impressed.  

I have a long-haired chihuahua named Rocky.  He is all white with one black eye and a few more spots here and there.  He is my best friend and I love him to death and would love to show you a picture of him sometime. 

Chihuahuas can have one of the coolest personalities in the world and then can turn around and get nippy when they are grumpy.  I guess that's why they're so cute so you automatically forgive them. 

 Take care.
I swear my braids come out the same!! I get insta scammed with the hair and make up lol

Attempting to do your hair until your arms get too tired and then just deciding to wear a ponytail. No YouTube video has ever been this relatable. 👍🏻
Jenna: *having an emotional breakdown over hair

Julien: bOuNCE mE MOMmY
The reason big thick braids look weird on you is because you have an oval head shape and not very thick hair, so when you make the braids big without putting some volume in the hair up close near your scalp, it looks disproportionate, try teasing the top of your hair first!
Title: trying hair braiding tutorials
Julian enters: what?! Where did that braid come from?!
R.I.P. to the squeaky intro
"it's not good or bad, it's just a look" lmao
“It looks like I’m cosplaying as Jesus” IM WHEEZING
julien looks like eugene’s beer bread with the basketball braid
You can try using a texturizing spray so that the hair stays where you pull it out instead of just getting loose in the braid. Your hair is too silky to get big and what not in the braid
u dont pull the braid loose, u pull upward on the edge, watch a video about pulling braids, its all about the angle.
my mom did the bow braid for my eighth grade dance. It was beautiful.
You know what's missing from this tutorial?

Jenna's fake beard
Jenna you should try to make fake lashes into the words Hell Yeah....weird idea but yeah❤️😂😂
How to get Instagram level hair: 
1. 20 gallons of secret hair product they don’t tell u about
2. 30 minutes of touching up after the “tutorial” to make sure it looks exactly camera perfect
3. Probably 4 miles of extensions for extra volume (or at least a different texture of hair)
This video is every girl when trying to do a new hairstyle lol SO relatable
Can Moq make a guest appearance again? It's been quite some time since we've been blessed by Moq
Jenna: “Julien I need you to put on a wig”
Julien, enthusiastically: “You got it!!” 
😂😂😂😂
Без русской озвучки Джена не Джена
That last hair tie braid thing reminded me of rough nut from how to train your dragon
You need a micro crimper to help with the volume so the braids fluff out more.
Jenna-    'I look like i got hit by a bus'
Julien-    'not like a bus, like a bicycle or something'

🤣 Im dying
Even with bad hair she is gorgeous 😂❤️
Loose braids are the fit tea of hair - jenna marbles gravestones
You hair just like mine, I have to use salt water spray to thicken it up before even remotely possible
those last braids are like Astrid from How To Train Your Dragon
"Is my face the problem?"

Me with every hairstyle😂😂
From another hair braiding impaired girl, THANK YOU! This is exactly my struggle. All the time!!! 😂😂
Long hair you said? HMMMMMMMM what about SimplyNailogical ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Julien's hair color is beautiful and looks amazing on him
My hair doesn't floof up either, im with you on being bamboozled by the braid floofieness
“It’s messy but like not in a cute way”
“Subjective but ok” 

😂😂 I love them

Edit : holy shit! thanks for 1K likes
You're keeping it too real dude, I agree with EVERYTHING you said in this video. And every other video but yeah.
My God, I can so easily imagine them as parents.
“You don’t really look like a basket-oh my gah.”
Jenna your hair is starting to look normal color we need crazy stuff done ASAP 😂😂🙏💗
Wow! He’s such a good friend for letting you practice on him!!
A video where she tries Daenerys braids
That last braid reminded me of Ruffnut from HTTYD.. YOURE A COSPLAYER.
Jenna your hair looks so amazing and long! I loved this I want to braid my hair!
The other day I grabbed a pair of scissors and I cut my ends I felt the ratchetness of Jenna's salon 🤣🤣
"look at me"
....
"don't look at me anymore"
I know you won't see this comment because this video is a couple months old and there's like 19,000 other comments on here, but I feel your hair braid struggles!


A few years ago, some younger female friends and I got into dyeing our hair and braiding it on a girls night in. I had a go, but my hair is so fine, and thin (thanks PCOS) that even when I managed to get a cute looking braid going, you could see bald spots on my hair around the braids because I have so little hair.
Like if I put all my hair into a ponytail and tried to put it in one of those pasta serving guides, I'd barely make one serving of spaghetti with my hair. Meanwhile, there are girls out there with such luscious thick hair that they could feed a whole family with their voluptuous hair. 


So I understand the struggle. Though of course I'm now going to try and braid my hair after watching this video.
Video idea: my boyfriend gets ready with me

Julien does your hair and makeup and picks out your outfit (optional: go out somewhere afterwards)
I mean why pull out when you can pull through 
-braiding 101
expectation: cute braid crown
reality: jesus
"cosplaying as Jesus" omg I needed a laugh today. Thank you Jenna
When you pull your braid apart don’t pull the three pieces!! Pull from the middle of each section and fluff each section out individually!
I get compliments on my dutch braids all the time. All I can say is it takes practice and there are days where I will redo it 50 times and it still won't look right. I also cannot pull my braids to make them look bigger it always looks messy, same with buns.
Honestly. I was just watching your eyebrows for the first two minutes of the video. They’re so expressive
Am I the only one who thinks that Julien kinda looks like Messi with a beard and moustache?
Jenna: sometimes I go on Instagram and feel really bad about myself If you know What I‘m sayin

Everyone watching: oh yes
Jenna: Everyone looks so perfect when I look like I got hit by a bus 
Me: Relatable 😂
I'm here because I've spent the last two days looking at hair tutorials and I can't even do a basic french braid. I'm sitting here with this wonky ass attempt at a french braid leaning toward my right shoulder. It's probably the best attempt I've done so far though! TT_TT
did anyone else notice her eye brows are on fleek 🙊🔥
6:19 'you look like a bike lock' I DIED
jenna: i look like i've been hit by a bus 
julien: not a bus....but a bicycle or something
Is “HELLLO?!” the new “HELL YEAH”
Why don't you let your dogs pick your make up? Then you use it and see how it ends up?


;^;
О боже, ты учила русский?)) Это очень мило❤
10:00 lol 😂 dying im a person?😥
"Sometimes I go on Instagram and I just start to feel real bad about myself. You know what I'm saying"

Yes Jenna I relate to you on a spiritual level
It helps if you make sure your hair is completely brushed and each section is cleanly sectioned out. But as far as fluffing your braids, theres only so much you can do. My hair is kind of thin (individual strands are thick but overall thin) so some braided styles with pulled apart braids just dont work or never look as fluffed.
Jenna: has a masters degree
Jenna on braiding hair: this is one of the hardest things ive ever done.

JENNA, we LOVE you. I just saw your draw my life video
We actually love and support you
Am I the only one who thought the side braid looked cute??
I feel like Julien needed more credit for his braiding abilities - I don't think I can braid my own hair that nicely lol
low-key looks like a Easter basket
I just love how supportive they are of each other and how much fun they have.
"I need you to put that wig on so I can try."
no hesitation
"YOU GOT IT!"

❤️❤️❤️
Jenna.. Your hair needs to be oil free and clean so your braids can be fluffy..  Love your videos ❤️
Jenna! 5 minute crafts uploaded hair braiding video tutorial!!
To be fair, Julien looked really good in long hair!! You tell him, Jenna!!!
I learned while I was young that I sucked at braiding hair. I kept practicing and now I can braid just about anything and still look nice. Keep at it! :)
Idk if you will read this or not but I just want to say thank you so much for making all your videos. Thursday’s are my favorite day because I get to see your new video and all of your videos have made me smile so much. I’ve gone through a really rough break up recently and tbh your videos have helped me escape and helped me heal so much. So again, not sure if you will read this but I just want to thank you so much for making videos and being a complete joy in my life ❤️
Julian grow back the hair... you look so🤗
please do a video trying to do cristine's/simplynailogical's old nail art
Jenna: She uses extensions, but i’m not gonna use extensions.

Also Jenna: WHY IS HER BRAID SO BIG??
"I've dabbled in braids..." proceeds to show amazing hair braid pictures
Hello! I just wanted to show you this on your most recent vid:

Epiphora is a condition that causes an abnormal overflow of tears. Cause of this condition due to the shape of the eyes in certain breeds.

Idk if you searched this up already, just thought it would be funny for my little 
i had the worst day and this video made me laugh so hard. thank you
TIP: when your fluffing our the braid just pull on the very edge of the braid and fluff out the braid as your braiding so the hair a looser and easier to pull out  and easier to control
"It looks like I'm cosplaying as Jesus" Lmao I'm Shaking 😂😂
gotta love those dahmer glasses though
Need to curl your hair before. More volume to work with:)
A Nelly Olsen NO from me...  Your natch long flowing style is stunning, though...
Is she saying "Hello?" like that meme with the chick that has water poured on her face in her sleep on purpose or do they just sound the same? I like it though, lol.
Bless you, Jenna, for exposing the struggle of people who CANNOT make the "fluffy braids" no matter how hard they try...

Jenna: even if i had a person with real hair
Julien: i'm a person..
5:52 All that came to mind.. “JESUS CHRIST, SUPERSTAR! NA NA NA NAA NA NA NAA NA NA!” 😂❤️
The Google pictures of you with braids are good. You look pretty in them.
The 2nd look on Julien looked like a fancy Elsa hairdo.

I love how you keep thinking that you failed when it looks awesome. I have the same issue, then I freak out and just do twisty spacebuns. 
The pull through braid looks better with hair coloured hair ties.

Also Julien's hair looks nice with the pale pink.
JENNA!! I LOVE YOU!!! BISH!! I FEEL YOUR PAIN, FOR REEEEAAAALLLL!!!!!! We are in the bad braid boat together. Love you. Lol
Dont take Julien to the movies with that wig, snacks arent allowed

Why did I just watch “Charles Franklin Marbles is a sad sad man”😂that was amazing because Marbles had life, he wasn’t dying on the inside he was  thriving (jk this is a joke😂) 
P.S Mr.Lion tried his best to make Marbles happy 😂😂😂😂
Lmao what a refreshing video from all this booty guru drama ❤️
2015: I dabble in bukkake
2019: I dabble in braids
Ever get a bra,.. where one side is bigger than the other?,.. like maybe there was a shift change at the factory & nobody said anything to the next machine operator,.. - Only way I can think of this maybe being the result,.. - it happened,.. - Only in the USA :)
You should do a collab with Simply Nailogical
Juliens 👏 Rachet 👏 Salon 👏 is 👏 Now 👏 Open 👏 For 👏  Business 👏
You're so pretty and I love you ♡
I relate 100% 😂😂😂😭😭😭🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
“I’m a person...” 10:05

I laughed so hard lol
"I look like Jesus!"  No darling, you look like a flower child.  :-)

All of those tutorials are rehearsed about 10,000,000 times before they're filmed.
I am not Jenna's target demographic AT ALL... but her videos are always strangely relaxing
Also they've awakened me to the fact that IM A VIRGO BEECH
Julien said you look like a bike lock im cryn
Here is some advice/tips you may find helpful! I think the main problem is the texture of your hair which was affected by having dry shampoo in it. Most of these hairstyles work better if your hair is more sleek, like second day washed hair. And if it doesn't feel sleek, it may be due to damage which you can try repairing through the following:
-rinsing out your hair with cooler (not icy cold) water whenever you wash it
-shampooing only the roots
-conditioning only the ends
-not brushing your hair while it's wet
-not using heat or heat tools on it (if you want curls, wet set pin curls is a great heat free way to do it!)
-sleeping on a silk or satin pillow
All of these can help reduce or minimize existing damage. You can also try applying a little bit of coconut oil, argan oil, moroccan oil, etc. which can help smooth out frizz.

There's also a specific technique to pulling apart the braids to make them fuller, which may be why yours didn't work. Try pulling apart just the outside edges of the hair section, instead of the whole hair piece. That way the braid stays in tact, but only the hairs around the outside edge of the braid get pulled apart, giving it the illusion of looking fuller. Also, brushing your hair out smooth at the beginning of the steps (such as making sure all 3 bunches of hair are smooth before braiding them), and the angle in which you braid your hair, both affect how the braid sits on your head. Lastly, I think at many points, the braids were too loose which was why a lot of the techniques you tried didn't work as well.

Кто тоже русский ставь лайк
At least two of those hairstyles don't look like hairstyles. They look like pieces of art that's just sitting on someone's head. Not practical at all, once you do a bit of movement they'll come apart.

But I mean, they look cute lol
Why do I so heavily relate 😂😩
julien: look at me 
jenna looks 
julien: don’t look at me anymore 
HAHAHAHAH
you guys should try and make satisfying videos like on snapchat and instagram
The first tutorial with Julian in the wig reminds me of Mrs Doubtfire
You need a texture spray girl!
You should try those hairstyles using kanekalon braid extensions. It'll give you all the fluffiness you dream of.    

 P.S. I would love to see you try the Game of Thrones braids!
"Is my face the problem?" oh girl SAME
I love how the cover photo you can tell she’s saying “julienne!”
Your hair looks so good in a middle part !!!!! <3
Jenna your braids are beautiful pieces of art, they belong in a braid museum.
Julien: "it looks good from far away and then you get close and it's like ughh"
Literally everyone at me
NEXT VIDEO JENNA FINAL PREPARATION FOR HER FIRST BASKETBALL GAME!!! She's been preparing for 3 years now and I think it's time..
Since I couldn’t do anything with my hair I chopped it off from time to Time so it went from past my waist to  near my elbows to shoulder length🤣🤣🤣
You two are my favorite and you're not alone with the braid struggles girl SAME.
Julian: Look at me
Jenna: Looks over
Julian:.. don’t look at me anymore
“ look at me “ ... 
“ okay don’t look at me anymore “ 😂
Jenna- ‘If I just had a person to do the braid on then I could do it’ 
Julien- ‘I’m a person...’ 

Hahahah
Julien braid my hair ! Honestly it came out better than something I would do to myself 😂
YOU HAVE TO DYE SIMPLY NAIL LOGICAL'S HAIR!
You should watch JnJ memes God is a Cermit
"You don't look like you've been hit by a BUS, maybe a bike or something... But that's a LOOK"
I just realized I have been watching your videos for 4 years and I never subscribed. I thought I was subscribed lol
This is the most relatable video. 
"I'll start doing some of this... I spent enough time...I'm gonna make it work... and then I'll get to here, and then I'll be like, I hate it. And now my arms are tired, my shoulders are tired... then you pin it up and you mess it up, and you gotta take it out, and you just decide you're gonna wear a ponytail.."  
this = me
Girl I get you! I have hair down to my butt but I'm braid challenged I swear! Lmao!!!!
Not gonna lie, Julien was giving me mild anxiety at first but then I started crying from laughter so I'm ok now.
Jenna: “i look like i got hit by a bus!”
Julien: “not like a bus, but like a bicycle” 

lmao i can’t with Julien 😂😂
Omg Jenna explains how i feel when i try to do hair tutorials XD

I spend hours of my free time trying out braiding tutorials and just sucking
I watched Jenna’s vid from 4 years ago and then one from now and *wOw
you should get a birdie

"Bounce me mummy" -Julian 2019
its been MONTHS and I'm still not able to look at your chevron chairs the same
For a man without like a daughter or something, julien did decent with just the simple braid tbh
9:57 IM DYING
You should cover your face in googly eyes.
To get the big flush out braids you have to hold the braids that you already have and then slowly piece by piece by The Edge grab it and pull it and so you feel resistance that way it'll get big
That bow braid is the first style I did on someone in beauty school.  It's actually super easy, WITH A BOBBY PIN, and turns out super cute.
This inspired me to try new braid hairstyles
I've been struggling with hair tutorials my whole life. Hair tutorials are a huge lie dude. They just don't work!!!!
"bounce me mommy"

also shout out to Julien for being supportive
Just two best friends doing best friend stuff together.
"im cosplaying as Jesus" i peed
I Jennna I love your videos. You should Do a dragon style braid in Julian's hair
"And I look like I got hit by a bus"
Me every day, Jenna. Me every day.
Girl! Look up pull through braids! It'll save ya life,
Every time she uploads, I think to myself “This is it. This is as creative as it gets.” buT EVERY WEEK SHE COMES BACK BEECH
Jenna- your going to look like a basketball 
Julien- I'm ready to be bounced
Not a bus, a bicycle 😂💀
IM NOT A REGULAR MOM IM A COOL MOM. PROBABLY THE BEST FORM IVE SEEN THAT LINE BEING RECITED
I've seen so many videos on your channel until now your jokes and ranting really makes me feel "i'm not alone at this " 😂 
You're amazing ... As always ..  because of this I unleash my inner Jenna marbles and made my channel ... Haha 
I'll be watching all your video again and again ..
slams hand on table
THIS IS THE CONTENT I SIGNED UP FOR.
Please go to Canada, in simplynailogical's house, and braid her hair because you're the only person she entrusts with that long luscious hair.
Will you see this? Almost certainly not. Anyway. Have you ever played the sims? You should do a video where you play the sims
Please bring back Moq!!!
JENNA👏 you need to braid your hair tighter! If you want the “pull apart” thing to work your hair needs to already be tight and by pulling it apart you’re making it loose. Just some information that might be helpful :)
Jenna - Julie i need you to wear a wig.
Julien - .. YOU GOT IT.
Please make a video with julien trying/making vegan pulled pork made from banana peels 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌
So the big floofy braids work better in thick hair because the more hair you have in the braid the wider you can get it 🖤👌
Omg you should try overtone 😍💜💙
Hi Jenna, Would you ever move back to the East??  I adore you :)
Julian: look at me ... 
Julian: don't look at me anymore 
All vibes 2019
Omg this is me trying to braid 95% of the time! 😂 Good effort though, especially on Julien’s wig! Love the hair bows! My claim to fame is a 5 strand braid on my own head for a quick hairstyle, or a 9 strand braid if I have time on someone else’s head. At that point you are basically weaving! 

Torrinpaige on YouTube is a good person to watch for braiding your own hair, I learned a lot of my braiding from her videos! I also think that a lot of people use texture spray before braiding to make their hair look fuller and make the braids stay better. Don’t give up!
I think you look beautiful, and if you started this trend I’d definitely support it 😍😍
You should do the nail polish video, from 5 min hacks
Maybe cuz u hit the wall harder than the dragon in GoT
Nobody:
Julien: Bounce me mommy
First you insult him by calling him a friend. Now he's not even a person. New low, Jenna 😂
when you stretch the strands of hair do not pull the whole strand. you draw only the edge of the strand. and I am from Russia and I adore you.
Jenna- you are not alone! This video made me laugh alot because its so true!!  Julien- “i’m a person” lmao😂
This is one of the most relateable videos I’ve ever watched 😂👌🏼
10:01
jenna: even if i had a person with a real head of hair it would..
julien: ᶦ'ᵐ ᵃ ᵖᵉʳˢᵒⁿ
"I'm a person..." hahahah dying
When the beat drops “Nice try is my city”
I used just for men on my eyelashes and it's a great tint and even curled them a bit. You just brush it on with a spoolie like mascara and wipe off the excess.
Ok idk how I'm just now finding you but I'm sooo glad I did!
"Loose braid tutorials are the 'fit tea' of Instagram" never laughed harder
Everytime I watch jenna marbles I think of jean chair.
Jenna babe you’re not pulling the braids apart properly that’s why is not working 😂
Not that is matters, but I came to subscribe to you after I saw the video of you with the kardashians and others playing a card game and the privilege card came up. You're highly intellectual and profound comment on the acknowledgment of the issue was purely beautiful, and I appreciated that.
This is amazing😂😂  made my night🤣🤣💀
Put Kermit Peach and Marbles in green suits so only their faces are showing and put them in front of a green screen
Can u make this a series of trying tutorials ??😍
Hey, I can help you to make volume pigtail💚
8:38

looks like one of those styrofoam nets that sometimes come on certain round fruits

i know you know what im talking about
I feel like every girl goes through a phase of trying these and getting extremely frustrated by them... Cause I've definitely tried almost everything in this video lmaooo
You should try an infinity braid!!
Bounce that Juli like a basketball
If you don’t
Don’t braid it at all
Me every time I try to do my hair. Also I'm so here for saying "you look like a bike lock" to somebody.
“Cosplaying as Jesus” 😂😂
off topic but why is jenna literally so gorgeous
Calling in sick for jobs you don't have 4 please
“Mine looks like i got hit by a bus”  YAS, SAME!
"Look at me, ..oh no don't look at me." Gets me every single time
I felt so seen- I can braid hair but "pulling it apart" doesn't work with thin hair.
Could you turn Julien into Doris from Shrek? Please like if you want this too.
You're so so sooooo beautiful! And soooo funny! Thank you for your videos. Your every video cheers me up. I can not stop watching them, how do you do it? Your dogs are very cute and really funny, especially Marbles, although he doesn't do anything special!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol idea: drunk hair styling a la drunk crafting video
This Aries energy is killing me.
Julien is his own hype man.
Jenna: shes putting in extensions, but I’m not gonna do that
Also Jenna: WHY IS HER’S SO MUCH FULLER
Girl your nails lately 👌Cristine would be proud
Juliens basketball braid looked like Rapunzel had a bad hair day and tried to do an updo.....and then continued to have a bad hair day 😂
Like a bicycle or something
HeLlO?!?!
Nobody:
Jenna: Is it my face?
"PUT SOME WHIPPED CREAM ON ME CUZ IM AN APPLE PIE."
Take a shot every time Jenna says, you didn't care about the front 🤣
oowwww, you make my soul smile .💕
How calm has she become? Or is it because of YouTube Demonentising Streak.
13:32 "I think if you had outrageously long hair"

Cristine has entered the chat
I have the same problem you have with those fluffy braids! I messed up my hair in the process, but I found a "hair hack" that I use and it works for my hair, so maybe it'll work for yours! (Note: my hair is damaged from bleaching and dyeing sooooo)... You can tease your three strands BEFORE you braid it to make those look fuller, then braid it. Once braided you tie the end of the braid three to two strokes (aka putting a piece in the middle), you pull it apart from the hair tie up, then you can tease the pulled strands.
prank call people by using clips of their own voice to talk so theyll literally think they having a conversation with themselves and be really confused.
I love your vids
 0'-'0
you could try teasing your hair before that might help
"It's just as fake as the rest of instagram"

Jenna spilling the tea 😂
The classical music in the background is just awesome
13:30 it’s just as fake as our comun instagram. 🤨is their tea
Watching you do Julien's hair is making me question your virgo-ness...
Collab with Cristine and try to do stuff like this!!
DID JULIEN REALLY SAY BOUNCE ME MOMMY????? IM SCREAMING
Thank you Jenna! I'm 25 and have the same problem every single day with my long flat hair! It is so a scam
Thank you for being real and relatable always :)
Curl your hair first! You need a little texture!
Also his long hair looked good
get Guy Tang to balayage your hair and do big pretty braids on you!
"even if I had a person, with a real head of hair!.."
"......ᶦᵐᵐᵃ ᵖᵉʳˢᵒⁿ......" 
poor Julie
pull apart your braid one side at a time, starting at the bottom. 
tug upward, not outward.
fluff ur braid while ur braiding it so it looks a little tighter and stays more fluffed

also please do christine’s hair bc she said she only trusts youuu
i wrote too much but pls like so jenna can see this.




i just wanna say that i first watched a jenna video when i was probably 10 or so and subscribed to jenna when i was maybe 12 or 13.  i'm turning 16 in a couple of months and a lot of things have changed and i've changed but jenna has been making me laugh for so many years and taught me some of the most valuable lessons i know. i know jenna doesn't personally know me, but through these years it feels like she's my friend or my sister,someone who'd look out for me if i got into trouble. my humor is 80% influenced by jenna and thats awesome to me. i started watching jenna before i fell into depression and now that i am on my way to recovery i'm glad i could grow these short years and many more to come with jenna on my side. I've been sick for about 4 years and now that i'm recovering im so glad im here and jenna got me through a LOT of shit. so thank you so much jenna for being one of the many reasons im here today. people say it all the time that someone's content saved them, which is really weird to me, but whenever i was sad or down id tune in onto jenna making herself into a toothbrush and die laughing. thank you so much, jenna . this was mushy and disgusting i'm so sorry.
with love from finland, Emma, (almost) 16, never fucking learned how to read.
dink dink
LOVE!! MAKE MORE OF THESE VIDS!
You guys should do the handcuffed together thing for 24 hours
Bounce me mommy😂
when you have 4b hair and you literally cannot braid it :)
The first braid really flattered her. The last one made her look like some russian lady. 😀
Maybe a high pony first, then the last braid. Although it'd be a sheep away from Blurred Lines.
I've never relate to one of your videos more than this. I'm convinced I'll never be good at hair things. My poor daughter. :(
I think the middle part looks good on you! (Without the jesus braid though)
You should try making a tighter braid to start with and when you’re done start pulling them apart
Could you color simply nailogical's at your ratchet salon
Jenna my love.
It's a hair texture thing. If your hair is too thick or too thin a braid won't hold. 
It's not your lack of skill 
It's your hair
I think the second look is actually really cute. I think maybe part of your problem here is that the braids you do are so tight? I don't know. I can't braid either.
I think Julien did a great job! Better than me. And the front looked so cute
that last 'braid' looks like rough-nut from how to train your dragon
“Bounce me Mommy” I FELT that
why does julien look like that weird girl with long hair and glasses who sits alone at lunch and looks at horse books at 14:34
Oh my God, I feel so much better, I can't for the life of me braid my hair and make it look good :))
The trick for fluffing braids is to start at the bottom and dont tie it off all the way down. Leave enough slack to pull up with. ALSO underhanded braids look much better fluffed than overhanded braids. I struggle with fluffing braids too. Dont feel bad. Lol.
I look like u got hit by a bus

“loose braids are the FitTea of hair” EYE—
LMAO “Cuz id open up a shop”
I found some tips! Okay, if your hair won't pull apart from the braid and look like goddess hair immediately it may be your hair texture. I also have this problem. Some folks who know more than me suggest curling your hair first so that it will stay full and curvey when you pull it out of your braid. Also, if you hold the braid by the bottom, where your elastic/hair tie is while you pull, it will be more even! Hope this helps. Good luck!!
me in 4th grade when I wanted to look cute on the first day of school
IM NOT A REGULAR DAD IM A COOL DAD CMON VANJIEEE
Jenna: I look like Jesus 
Me Immediately: WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF USSSSS JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF USSSSSSS
ｍｏｑ ｈａｓ  ｅｎｔｅｒｅｄ   ｔｈｅ   ｃｈａｔ．
you have to tie it and then pull it apart haha i love this. I went through the same struggle.
ok why did that random blonde girl just take julien’s place?? she’s hot but i wanted to see julien get his hair braided
С каждым годом Дженна все моложе.
КАКОГО ЧЁРТА?!
(Ты красотка❤)
Braid community on YouTube: "NOBODY SEES THE FRONT OF YOU!!!"
It hurts me to watch you suffer !! I want to hug and help you! you are wonderful !! But I live in Russia, so hug will not work, but help .. maybe. Jena, you need to stretch the braid over the very edge of the strand, and not over the whole strand.
“Bounce me, mommy.” I DIED😂😭
Just two friends braiding each other’s hair:)
why does Julian never blink
"Bounce me mommy" 😆😆😆😆
@BrandMondo
 Jenna did hair bows!
You look like the twin from How to train your Dragon with the laat braid lol
i’ve been subscribed since the days of the spider-man cardboard cutout and you’re the one person my love for has not faded even slightly over the years. i grew up on your content and i really love your new stuff. i like watching your videos when i get home from work or when i’m sad because it feels like hanging out with a friend
You litteraly never use clickbait unlike Lucus and Marcus
OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS VIDEO I CANT BREATHE SKSK
When y'all getting married
When y'all getting married
Jenna: Even if I had a person with a real head hair, it would-
Julien: ...im a person. 



lmao
whoa when i imagine julian as an old man i picture mr fredrickson from the movie up
Jenna. Braids.
Wig. Snatched.
4:54 jenna straggling to take out rubber bands🤣🤣
You just have flat slick hair booboo. If you had some layers and some dry shampoo it would look more like the pictures, you’re really good at doing them!. Lol don’t be discouraged
Kind of disappointed jenna didn't reference her basket ball game tomorrow
it's just me or Tyler Oakley and Julian could be... siblins? They are kind of alike
I just realized how much you look like one of my teachers and my art teachers.
With my hair type, I feel so seen by this video lol
"set it & forget it", lol ♡
"I'm a person" Julien - 2019
i totally felt Jennas frustration and felt like crying lmaooo
u should do "getting my eyebrows professionally done"
I actually thought that side swept one looked super cute on you
Jenna's Ratchet Salon meets the Aries Braid Shop
Can you do your makeup without moving your brushes just move your face? Luv you jenna❤️
Обожаю тебя Джена😍 спасибо, ты поднимаешь мне настроение✌️
I would really love to see Juillian with a Goirnno Govanna hairstyle.
He would look like a snacc
I think the reason why I doesn't look good when you pull the braids apart is that you pull the whole stands, you have to pull out only a part of the strand :D
No squeaky intro for 6 months , why?!
“Julián i need you to put on that wig so that I can try” 
“You got it!”
Lol 😂😂
I never could French braid!
Hey Jenna, I know you have a lot going on and I'm sure my comment will get lost in your several followers! But I just want to say thank you! You've literally made me laugh since 2010 or 2011 and I'm just now commenting! You've really been there for me even if you didnt know it! The laughter you have brought me really helps me through some just plain sad times! Not necessarily bad times, but times where everything in my life is serious or focused on college and I just needed to crack a smile! You've helped me do that! Both you and julie! I love you both! If it's not to much to ask just let me know if you've read this 💜 it's been a long time coming and I just hope you see it! Thank you again and keep doing what you do girl!
The first braid you did grew on me throughout the video and I loved it lol
When you getting a cat lol
“I look like I’m cosplaying for Jesus” i SCREAMED
I laughed so hard at the first hair style and then immediately thought Jenna looked like Jared Leto (in the best way) with the Jesus braid
Girl! The struggle IS real!! I have been trying those damn braids for.... forever... I can not get the cute poofy braid look no matter what the hell I do! It's not just you!
Bounce me mommy! LOL.  My arms always get too tired trying to do my hair, I always just wear a ponytail or messy bun because I give up lol.  You should try these with dreadlocks lol, it's a whole other ballgame
The way that I am entertained by her failing at braiding 😂
Disguise yourself to blend in with your plants and scare Julien
Вах Джена учила русский~°3`~
But also, i feel u. Instagram is the devil i swear bc it also teases me with the notion that "pretty hair in 3steps!" Is a thing....more like "how to give up on your feminine hair abilities in 3steps"
can we talk about how still julien was sitting when jenna was doing his hair? for some reason i’m really proud :,)
I did the last braid on my self but one down the back, it’s on my Instagram @mellanellanie - I’m a hairstylist from Toronto! ❤️
“LOOSE BRAIDS ARE THE FIT TEA OF HAIR” DYING 😹😹😹
Why do I relate to this soo much
You are the bridge which makes Instagram relatable. You make people feel good about themselves coz most of us are as incompetent as you at the whole beauty thing. Love you!
Your profile looked awesome!  If the only thing anyone saw was the side Julian would have been able to say he was a rock star hair stylist... the back tho... wow... J needs lots of practice!!!  BTW... you are gorgeous even with Julian styled hair!!
Jenna: it looks like I got hit by a bus
Julien: not by a bus, like a bicycle or something 

LMAO JULIEN IS SUCH A MOOD
I make braids all the time at myself - till 10 times per day xD - and can make my own hair into a french braid in under a minute. Rarely did I braid others hair but I noticed, it really is a hard job that takes me almost half a hour! And the output is not even that good. Its so different to make it and you can be great in braiding other peoples hair and failure on your own - and the other way around. Both needs practice for itself as if its a totally different work. With a little practice and maybe tutorials you all can make beautiful braids ;P

Hope you can understand my english😅😓I need to practice more, too...
the “what?” at 1:08 😂
Instagram braids don't look good on me either girl! Live yo life!
lmfao this shyt had me laughing so hard i was crying. same shyt happens to me.
"bounce me mommy" 😂






safe to say they're not in the friendzone anymore
do a video doing cristines hair!!
LOVE YOU JENNAAA!!!!!
REaction to the weave hairstyle by my sister - he looks like a waffle head!
“Look at me... Don’t look at me anymore.”
“You look like a bike lock”
Collab with SimplyNailogical! She has ridiculously long hair
Your braid doesn’t pull apart like that because your hair is too thin. I have that problem as well. You gotta tease it and try and influence it to be “thicker” and then try again. But honestly not worth the damage teasing does to your hair.
jenna you should try pancake art !!
I’m still disappointed that she didn’t reference the “Braiding Things Into My Hair” video during this
Your way better at hair than me
Someone with obscenely long hair to braid? Sounds like the perfect opportunity for a collab with Simply Nailogical; you do Cristine's hair, and she does your nails!
jenna baby i love you but i can tell thru the screen ur hair is so damaged
This is my boyfriend when i ask him to put my hair in a ponytail xD
"I look like a Jesus..." 😂
As a trained hairdresser, I'd love to do your hair for you someday, just do you could be happy with it for once 😅😊
Everyone:

Jenna Marbles: “Loose braids are the Fit Tea of hair. They look good in a picture, but like I’m getting scammed.”
I have had the exact conversation with my fiancé. I don't know how to do the amazing thick braids either
mother of dragons breaker of chains?
Why am i just now seeing this?!!
i want more plants / homey vids agagagagag
She hasn't said "Oh Hell YEAH" in forever. That's what worries me, not the braids 🤣
HélLø. Rüdë. I thought the side-swept braid looked great INCLUDING WITH YOUR FACE. tHaNk yOu VeRy MuCh
Loving this. 


Around 8:18 you look awesome with the hairdo
It’s fine. My hair is paper thin so I can’t make fluffy braids either. I don’t even try.
Jenna , when you said theres so much dry shampoo in your hair , I felt that within my soul . Girl , I FEEL YOU
Loose braids are the fit tea of hair


No truer words have ever been spoken
you should have Milabu do your hair! or even better, Simplynailogical
It wasn't a wig... it was a WIG LOBSTER!!








anyone?
idk why, but every time I watch Jenna, she reminds me of Christina Grimme! It makes me sad, but so happy at the same time! ❤️
I think you just needed more hair on that braid to make it bigger
"Subjective, but OK" 😹
Julien!  Literally every serial killer from the 80s is wearing those glasses.
Julien: oh I can braid
Jenna: squints in disbelief
LMAO lost it when she said she looked like Jesus 😂😂
Summary of the video: heLLOH??????
Oh beach, it’s ARIES SEASON . Julien is at his finest.
there are products to use that keep braids lookin hood when yu pull em. hair dresser scammin tricks lol
15:30 am accurate description of my face
I just figured out that Julien looks like the main character in the movie Hair. Treat Williams is the actors name. I couldn’t figure it out for years who he reminded me of! Probably the only one who noticed it, but whatever ;)
Dude, your hair looks dead. And I'm not talking about Julien's wig.
PUT YOUR BEARD ON WITH YOUR JESUS HAIR AND MAKE YOURSELF A ROBE cause it’s arts and crafts and beards bro and Jesus 👌🏼
you should test overtone hair coloring products
No one:
Jenna: "Hello? "
honestly im like jenna. whenever i try something that looks fantastic on other people i look like a freaking idiot when i try it! XD


but jenna doesnt actually look bad. but i do :p
"I just look like I'm coming from another century"
I am extremely disappointed that you didn't mention your Basketball game tomorrow during the basketball head braid Jenna.😪🏀
i know im a few months late on this video but honestly that loose french braid she made that became a loose bun was an incredible look i honestly loved it
She just needs to take more hair to braid with
Story of my life with my barely there hair lol. You did great, Jenna. Keep trying!
AM I THE ONLY ONE BINGE WATCHING ALL HER VIDS AT 12:31 AM WHEN I'VE GOT SCHOOL  TOMORROW 😂😂😭😭😭
You should do your makeup not moving the brush, just your face.
WHY do you sound so DEAD inside and WHY do i love it 😂😂😂
Блиин Я очень ее люблюю, но неее могуу воспринимать ее женский голооос😭😭😭😭😭
I wish I paid more attention to my hair lol idk how people are able to do their hair lookin like they're going to a gala everyday!!!!

Also, I JUST posted a new travel vlog!!! Go check it out! Hurry!!!!!
i love that they just do stuff like this together. couple goals
Looks at all these tutorials 
cries in thin hair
I, too, had never been able to weave such braids. The secret is that they need to weave tighter. After all, then you fluff them, but instead it turns out that they crawl away and become similar to snot. Just whip them tight
every time julien looked at the camera with the wig on and that look on his face lmaoooooo
Hahahahaha 17:48 🥰
"Its not good or bad, it's just UH LOOK."  - julien aries season 2019.
I do this exact same thing! I did the same thing with a French braid on myself today!!!
This video was oddly satisfying 😁
Can y’all get married already❤️
Make a ASMR cooking video o;
Julien "look at me.... Don't look at me anymore" I busted out laughing when he said that
Your braids just need to be tighter if you want to pancake them. So they keep the structure. And pull the ends and work your way in.
you should try resin ink pouring (search it up its actually really cool)
У неё женский голос
I feel your struggle. We have the same hair type.
Jenna: I look like I got hit by a bus!!! 
Julien: nooo...JUST a bicycle 😂😂😂
OK A LOT OF THESE ACTUALLY LOOKED REALLY GOOD THO??????????????? U DID A GOOD JOB JENNA
One more thing: dont feel bad about those stupid insta hack braids. Cosmetologists dont do those either 🙃 ive never done that that you did and never had a need to. Also all those big giant fluffy braids are 9/10 extensions and teasing the hair and those fancy ass braids from like russia or whatever are never asked for or done. Thats stuff we only see for hair shows and whatnot. 🤷🏻‍♀️ dont beat yourself up jenna.
There are tools to help you braid, maybe you should try those in a vid
13:33 christen where u at
"even if i had the gold mine of ability, honey , I wouldn't do it on you everyday"
"Why"
"'cause I would open up a shop"
capitalism right there
ur braid needs to be tighter and bigger
I accidentally have julien's hair
girl, pull all your hair to the side, put two bands in it, pull the entire thing through the top part, then do it with the bottom and ya have yourself a fake French braid lmaoo
As someone with hair that goes past my waist I have a lot of issues with having hairstyles that are going to be adaptable for my hair length.
WE STILL WANT TO SEE YOU AND JULIEN PAINT POTS TOGETHER FOR YOUR PLANTS! 🌿
Don’t be upset, Jenna, you’ve done a great job!And I’m O N E    H U N D R E D percent sure that ONE DAY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BRAID HAIR LIKE DAENERYS DO
When pulling your hair to make it bigger, you want to do it as you braid. So braid a little, pull, braid a little, pull, etc. And only pull the outsides, not the entire piece. Hopefully that helps, you’re doing great!! ❤️
Satan is quacking from that Jesus..
Try teasing your hair first. You need it to stick to itself before you start so when you fluff it out it stays. Gurlll yo hairs are too thin.
This video screams me in 6th grade trying to “look good 4 them bois”
Second day hair would have been a better choice lol
Actually cried of laughter haha
*HeLLO?*
I'm crying😂😂 I'm not a regular mom ima cool mom🌠
"Bounce me mommy!"

I just can't with these two 😂
Please do another video doing weird shit to the Debbie machine.
HER FIRST SENTENCE WAS LITERALLY THE STATEMENT OF MY LIFETIME
I love your hair this color
8:27 was like when I try to phonetically read Russian
i’m the least observant person in the entire world and i never realized how many plants were in the background until your last video

and now they’re the only thing i can see
Джена, если хочешь пушистую косу - заплетай ее тесно и растягивай постепенно(в процессе плетения, а не в конце)  только части крайних прядей.
BOUNCE ME MOMMY
Tips: starting with curly hair actually does help make fluffier braids! Only pull braids from the edges starting at the bottom and moving to the top of the braid. If you want really tight braids, start with damp hair. Smooth the hair out as you braid to keep each tendril tight and tidy while you braid.
I'm a person
“She takes two extensions, but I’m gonna see if I can do it without extensions!”

Literally 2 seconds later:
“See how much bigger her braid is than mine? Why?”
IF YOU WANT A PUFFY BRAID YOU NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE HAIRTIE WHEN YOU PULL ON THE HAIR. At least it helps.
10000000% relatable! I have braid issues too
Do more plant videos
Julien: It’s Actually Impressive, Hello?
B O U N C E  M E  M O M M Y
14:11 thank we later 😂😂😂
“Bounce me mommy” im dying
Julien at 14:40 IS SUCH A MOOD
I want a part 2
"Is my face the problem?" 
I ask myself that every day.
Man, Julien looks like the most peaceful guy out there
Try using more hair in your braids more volume
Can you rant for us again? I loved the other one that you did want see another one.
i'll braid your hair jenna
Happy Aries Season, Julien. Get legs.

Jenna...bless, get wine
Needs more Curb theme tune.
“bounce me mommy”😂😂
Having Julien braid ur hair DURING ARIES SEASON was such a bad idea
“Not...not a bus, like...a bike.”
"honestly 'nice try?' that's my city."

me too, julien, me too.
Brad mondo can’t do the bow braid and Jenna can almost 😂 WHAT
im ready to be bounced
just shave ur head like i did jenna, i hated washing/doing my hair (especially after makeup) and now i only have to focus on one lol
9:42 when the librarian hears your voice level raise above a whisper
can we get Jenna to 20 mil already sksksksks
I liked the video as soon as the words "instagram" and "feel bad about myself" left her mouth
You should make a video doing someone’s prom hair/makeup/eyebrows
Ok kinda liked the jesus doo
"You can do it. Make me into a basket."
-Julien, 2019
Oh, I feel your pain on this one. I can never get the fancy braids to look right on my head. I think it's because my hairline's a bit square, and my parting's central - I know there was a centre part in this video, but SO MANY styles I want to try rely on a side parting and I canNOT make that work on my head for some reason
Also, that second one didn't look bad! Like, 5 more minutes making it 'neat', and that would be a good look on you ^^
You look like the female twin from How To Train A Dragon
Jenna. The trick to fluffing your braid is to make tighter braids where the strands of the pieces that overlap each other are almost horizontal to each others.  The easiest way to do that is to braid out instead of down and tighten the pieces as you go. ♡ your hair looks beautiful! Hope this helps!
Julien is too funny in that wig, I can’t 😂😂😂
when are you gonna collab with simplynailogical
When we were children my sister was obsessed with these complicated braid hairstyles and she bought books on how to do them (because internet tutorials wasn't exactly a thing in the early 2000s). Seeing this video totally reminded me of her fiddling with hair lassos and hair bungies.
Julien dam loook at that hair😂so me
Omg I can so relate
Watch this vid where whenever they're sitting together and jennas explaining stuff, u watch Julian.
Julien trying to be honest but not mean for 18:40 straight
Your hair is soooo long again Jenna! It is beautyfull!
“I’m a person” 😂
whenever I try to braid it just looks like something the cat threw up
Clean hair would of been a bit more ideal for fluffy braids.
5:55 
“Look at me”
“....”
“Don’t look at me anymore”
with the braid you have to only pull out the outer pieces not the whole giant braid piece
JENNA!!! the side braid looked good! Whachu talkn bout?
this is exactly how i feel when i try and braid my hair
Maybe use some thickening powder...tease strategically and hairspray. You look like you have really fine hair but lots of it - so you need products to help you out. A lot of the people who make videos have thicker more course hair. Not fine straight hair.
hearing her say the word basketball multiple times and not ONCE saying “ive got a basketball game tomorrow” is wack to me
Try a waterfall braid. Subtle, pretty, easy.
your hair is my mood😂
5:55 Jenna be looking like Jesus!!!🙏🏼
Do the makeup in alphabetical order challenge 💖
“I look like a Jesus”

Edit: wow I never gotten this much likes before can’t believe 320 ppl think I’m funny lol
“I look like a Jesus” 😂
There are eight plants visible
do a wig try on collection video... on julien
she needed a basketball braid fo her  BASKETBALL GAAME TOMOOROWWW
It's Aries season, Jenna. Even though I'm an Aries, I'm praying for you to get through this.
If ya part it in the middle it works better
“Fluff” out the braid before you tie it
You should try a waterfall braid
Lol, I can't even put a ponytail in my hair
B O U N C E    M E    M O M M Y
SAAAAME Jenna this video is relatable af 🙌
I'm sure someone already commented this, but, if you take a piece at the end, past the hair tie, and gently push it up as if you were teasing your hair kind of, and then do what you're doing by pulling it to make it even on either side, you should get what you're looking for, maybe? 😬 I really don't know how else to explain it, but I know what I'm trying to say idk 😂 you have to make sure your hair is nice and brushed though or you'll get the frizzy fly aways.. good luck bb
If you use more hair in your braids they will get bigger and fluffier when you pull them out.
Please do a video about how ridiculous 5 minute craft videos are and then do some of them......drunk
“Loose braids are the Fit Tea of Instagram.”

Yes 👏🏻
Please do more hair stuff like this omg
Girl.... clean hair for poofy braids and don’t pull them apart from the middle, that’s not gonna make them puffy that’s gonna leave a hole in the middle. Pull the outsides of the strands GENTLY. Don’t pull the strands away from the braid, pull the strands themselves apart do each strand is thicker.
Hope this helps 🤷🏻‍♀️
LOVE YOU JENNA (&JULIEEEENNNN)
some people say to this day jenna remains pulling her braid apart
This vid is such a mood and I relate 😂😂
someone should make a compilation of julien staring blankly at the camera while jenna talks
Julien? Can’t braid
Jenna? Can’t braid
Danika? Also can’t braid
The entire population that isn’t hair dressers? CANT FRICKEN BRAID!!! 


No normal person can do these. Wtf.
Ok so to fluff up the braid, massage it loop by loop. Look up Kaylee Melissa, she has a lot of good tutorials and she did videos on the basics of braiding
I think they all look great.
How are people not commenting on the amount of dry shampoo? Hahah I love you Jenna and I feel you.
HEEELLLLLLOOOO?
"Julien, can you braid?"

"Yeah, let me get my tools."

Oh lawd.
U beautiful, вроде правильно
more plant videos ahaha
How do u care for your murbles, is he urlive? :)
I relate to this on a molecular level. My hair doesn't seem to fluff out either, when they "pull the sections out" it just makes gaps! It doesn't make it look thicker
You should dye your leg hairs in preparation for summer
I love u Jenna u are awesome
Reading toxic product reviews??
Keep practicing! The more you practice the better you become. Try doing it on a mannequin head first for some time to get yourself in a better place. You can do it!
"look like Jesus" .i just choked on my cereals😂
Jenna! Can you please take on your beard and wear it a whole day? That would be effin awesome!!
When you pull the braids apart pull at the hairs at the edge of the loop as if you were gonna pull out the hair from half of the loop, also it’s easiest when you do tight Dutch braids how you normally would
10:04 “I’m a person.” 😂
I told myself, “once my hair is long enough I’ll do so much with it” ... my hair is currently passed my breasts and I don’t do anything with it!
I have to say, Jenna is looking more beautiful at 32 than in her 20's. Her skin looks gorgeous, her eyes pop, and her hair looks beautiful and healthy. I am the same age as Jenna (a few months older, I'm an Aries hahahaha) and she gives me hope that I too can look hot at 32 LOL!!
When they say hello... that's everything
Jenna ur hair is so dead 
No shade tho I love you
wash your hair and then it’ll be more fluffy maybe
"I ruin everything I touch,"
- jenna and probably rupi kaur
“bounce me mommy”
I can relate to Jenna so much.
Jenna just made me feel 1000% better abt braiding with normal non-insta hair
my favourite thing about Jenna is that after ALL these years of YouTube, so many people have come and gone from the platform, but she has continued to stay hilarious, entertaining, and amazing at her job. xoxo
Jenna with the Jesus hair: "I would get ROASTED"
me: "I think you mean CRUCIFIED"








maybe that joke is too dark...
Jul: "I'm a person :c"
the key to a fluffy braid is not to just pull the hair apart but to losen the strands of the braid!! it’s so hard to explain but you have PERFECT hair for braids!! I
I tend to find pancaking hard too... But I think what you're doin is pulling out the whole portion of hair... Maybe instead try only pulling out the edge of the hair portion... That probably doesn't make sense though 😅
Getchu a man who says you look like a BiKe LoCK
Jenna if you started a video with a braid across your head, you wouldn't get roasted, you'd get crucified.
I had this phase on my life. I grew tired of it.
Noooo, Julien you looked great with long hair!
lmao I appreciate the braided dog hair you flashed up as inspo
Youre one of the youtubers that don't expire
no one:

jenna: is my face the problem
Не привычно слышать Дженну с женским голосом вообще не то
you should only pull the outer part of each strand, when braided
dont worry idk how to even do a french braid
You should try rope braids. You just split it into two parts, twist one strand in one direction, then twist the second strand the same direction (like clockwise or counterclockwise) and then you twist the two strands together in the opposite way. (This is probably overexplaining but just in case, if you twist both strands clockwise, then do them together counterclockwise) then just tie it off. It's pretty easy. 
You can step it up by doing a French twist which is just very similar to a French braid. You just do take twos strands from the front but each time you twist them as you move towards the back of your head, you just gather a little more hair before twisting, the same way you would with a French braid. So French twisting your hair back then doing a rope braid is not too difficult but looks really cool
Anyone else notice the braided dog at 0:50? 😂
I never comment but dang girl, I think you and a lot of commenters need help. The reason it goes flat again after you've pulled your braid is because you're pulling an entire piece when you try to fluff it. So think of it like this: You have three strands -- let's call them Kermit, Peach, and Marble. You've braided them together and now are ready to pull them a bit. When you start with the Kermit strand, only grab a third of it rather than trying to loosen the whole thing. Take the outermost third of the Kermit strand and spread it away from the rest of the Kermit strand, KEEPING THE REST OF THE KERMIT STRAND TIGHT. Then move to the Peach strand and pull out the outer third of that, KEEPING THE REST OF PEACH TIGHT (har har). Then move to the Marble strand and pull out the outer third of that, same as before. And so on and so forth until you get to the bottom of your braid. Because you've kept the structure of Kermit, Peach, and Marble intact, the bits you pulled will maintain their voluminous effect. It's not so much about "loosening" the braid as it is about just spreading it. =)
If all beauty guru’s hairstyle and makeup reveals had Julian saying “oh shit” in the background with their music playing too I’d definitely be watching more makeup and hair tutorials!!
Julien looked like he felt so pretty in that bow hair style.. 😂
I finally feel seen! 😭 Lol
HELLO?!?!
Julian: you know what doesn’t feel weird? Lookin SnAATChed! 
Jenna: ok
Jenna: Putting the "mental" into "experimental braids"
jenna, you should try to learn more on yourself. i have a really hard time braiding hair that ISNT mine haha! keep practicing!!!!
Easier to fluff ur hair if u tease it first W hairspray or a brush
0:50 ok but did no one notice
i hate the stupid “5-minute hairstyles” but they start with their hair curled THATS A 40 MINUTE HAIRSTYLE
I never laugh as hard as I do when I hear and see Julien. He’s probably my favorite person on YouTube
I cant braid other peoples hair, I can braid my hair though? Like im good at braiding my hair but when somebody asks me to do theirs, it looks gross. Idk lol
Cute Girls Hairstyles has a very helpful video on "pancaking" braids.
Please do the coal and peanut butter trick where it turns the coal into a diamond. I wanna see if it’s real😂😂
"I look like I'm cosplaying as Jesus" got my like. I don't know how many times I've thought that about myself with a center part.
The pull apart method of the braid works well when you do 2 or 3 links of the braid and then you pull one side of the strand and not the whole strand and then you braid about 3 links again and repeat. Don't know if that makes sense haahha you guys are very cute. Xx
I just noticed Julien’s Italian greyhound tattoo
2019.. Girl..still wearing a choker ..hmm that's different
The “oh shit” got me 😭😭
It’s Aries season. Let’s gather around to pray for Jenna🙏🏽
you know what, you should try more of a inspiration than replication in every craft you try
or be worse at it and more bratty that would be funnier and easier for julien to bounce some jokes off you
Can u PLEEAASSE do a hair dying tutorial on that wig from Jenna's ratchet salonnnnnn
those insta girls either have thick a** hair or tons of extensions.  your hair wont ever look like that in braids.  look up thin hair braids
Can you try making an arm knit blanket?
jenna: it would only work if you had outrageously long hair.
me: CoLlAb TiMe WiTh SiMpLyNaiLlOgIcAl!
Так странно слушать ее настоящий голос 😅
can you get a new hammer??
You should do henna eye brows
Make me into a basket 😂😂😂😂
Any other (non-supportive) boyfriend, 
“I’m not putting on a wig wtf ThAt’S gAy” 
Jenna : Can you put on a wig for me to practice on?
Julien: “You Got IT!” 
can we just take a moment and appreciate two souls that are LITERALLY perfect matches☺️
love the nonchalant sneaking of a dog in the inspiration slides @0:49 seconds
Julien  at 4:51 is legit me allllllll the time
i love juliens hair, good job jenna
I just love that Julien low key looks like an 80's nerd dad
i saw a video on my recommended on how to make a wig. you should try to make a wig lol.
5:40 Jenna don’t pull out sideways. Pull up on the outsides or the strands. And do it as you go gently not just do it and try to pull it out.
when will you get that cat you've wanted for so long
“cosplaying as jesus” is one of jenna’s many hobbies
JENNA I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM! (with pulling braids out) I discovered that the reason it's hard for me is that I don't have super thick hair. Also, the best way I pull my braids is I have to do dutch braids extremely tight and then pull them out V.S. braiding it loose then pulling it out. If I do them loose shit just falls out when I start pulling.
10:04 Julian saying 'I'm a person'  was so cute
Julian actually looks so zen and pretty in that braided wig
I think you need day old hair not 5 day old hair 😂😂
Julien could have put actual shit in Jenna’s hair and she’d be like “we need some more practice, but I’m very impressed, honey.” She’s literally the nicest, most caring person on planet earth. ❤️❤️
Jenna looks beautiful, no matter how she does her hair. Such an amazing spirit, inside and out. The only YouTuber that makes me 100% happy watching her videos.
the look at 7:30 looks great :)
Yo middle part your hair more beetch
jenna marbles please see "Crazy Homeless Hog Pen Band"
BOUNcE mE MamI (Julien, 2019)
If you braid them really tight to begin with, and then do a gentle massaging motion on the edges of the braid it will fluff out more
"bounce me mommy"
The solution is you need highlights!
8:51 tana mongoose cough cough
1) Jenna you’re looking like a true SNACK
2) this video was was funnier than necessary 
3)julien is such a good bf
Softball helmet hair for the first braid
Sorry to all the collab comments but I’m pretty sure she’s not doing another collab any time soon.
I have never related to anything more. Preach.
Jenna!! Can you try to make a wig? Get bundles and a cap? 😍
Jenna:  "well, you're going to look like a basketball, so..."

Julien:" I'm ready to be bounced."
Try stroke painting!!
Omggggggg if anyone watches m.a.s.h. the, doesnt Julian remind you of radar O'Reilly
Next on Jenna's ratchet salon you should make that butt bra that you've always wanted
Do bantu knots in your hair! You'd look so cute!
For half a second I actually expected Julian to do really well, but then I remembered... He's an Aries.
Julian: "Put some whip cream on me because I'm an apple pie" 
I'm sorry Jenna i'm turned on.
“Bounce me mommy!” -Julien
Grab the puff part of the braid and rub your pointer and thumb together to rough up each section.
kristine and jenna collab!
Get you a man that supports you with the most endearing words 


"You look like a bike lock"
Part 2!
juliens hairdo for Jenna was honestly gave me Lolita hairstyle vibes and it was cute
I love your hair that color. <3
Do SiMpLY NAiLoGicals hair!!!!!!!!!
“Even if I had the goldmine of ability 

HuNnY

I wouldn’t just do it for you everyday”
this ALWAYS happens to me! WhY are my braids so skinny I hate it
Why'd it actually look better without her face lol
girl wtf  fasce time on mebitch!
Wash Kermit with Irish Spring soap please
”I’m a complete beginner”
talks about plants for 30 minutes
"in about thirty years he'll be a full plant"


my brain: music plays 62 year old ladyyyy
most youtubers now: CRAZY STORY GONE WRONG? I HAD A BREAKDOWN? 
jenna: lol heres my plants
Jenna: "I'm a complete beginner" 
Also jenna: has 147 plants
Not problematic, minds her own business, wholesome, inclusive, caring for everything omfg this is the ideal human
Your ability to wholeheartedly care for others - people, dogs, fish, hamsters, plants - is absolutely amazing. Such a beautiful soul.
Jenna: I'm a beginner
Also Jenna: Names every single plant in their house and tells how to take care of them
jenna just reversing the effects of global warming from her house
This video started an addiction. I've bought 22 houseplants since it went up. Thank you, Jenna.
ooh damn girl you lookin like you’re on your way to a step grandparents barbecue
omg you know their scientific names! gurlll you a freaking botanist
This kind of felt like Vogue 73 questions, but with just plants
if someone was sick, then walked into jenna’s house they would be cured instantly
She is still trully growing because in the "Things I Suck At As An Adult" she said she couldn't take care of her herb garden and showed all the withered plants and now she has all this beautiful healthy plants she loves and knows so much about. So proud <3
I love Jenna's passive agressive jabs at the previous plant owners. Too often plant collecting is a rescue mission more than a hobby lol
Jenna how the hell did you make potted plants interesting? Like you really can post anything and we'll watch it lol.
Hi Jenna, I take care of these really nice trees from India and are not very common in America called “Ming Arailia’s” . They are really neat and happy plants that grow based on a size pot you put them in. I have some that are 6 inches tall and others that are about 3 feet and still growing. Let me have the pleasure in sending you a clipping so you can add em to your collection🙂

Plz like this so she can see this. I want her to have one😂

Edit: my Twitter is @youneedjesustb if you want me to send a photo of my plant babies
She is the bob ross of plants
When’s the watering routine dropping??? Cause idk why this video was hella relaxing
this video changed me into a 32 year old lady a decade early lol. somehow in the past three weeks I've watched his video like 8+ times and have accumulated 87 plants 😬 so satisfying to buy and take care of plants! 🌱
You should do your makeup not moving the brush, just your face.
Wow I avoided watching this for a while now bc I was like ok boring but damn I enjoyed this a lot
“I think rubber plants are the most underrated house plants” Jenna please put that on a T-shirt
My sexual fantasy is someone talking about me the same way Jenna talks about her plants
There’s an old Cherokee myth my grandma would tell me : Plants inside or around the home that are taken care of by you will absorb any curses that might be sent your way. Jenna you are probably so safe from curses lol 😂💞
2000's Jenna:  hOw wHitE giRlS hAvE sEx 

2019 Jenna: This is my beautiful house plant collection and here is some pragmatic information about plant-care.
Jenna: Includes Nonbinary people in her intro
Me: heart explodes
I’ve watched this plant tour at least 45 times
nobody puts MS KEISHA in a corner.
“~32 year old laayyyydieees~ and men and nb people” 100% the ally we deserve
Jenna just mothers anything she can I love it
I've come back almost a week after my birthday. I just turned 32. Yes, I already watched this video, but I was an inexperienced 31 year old then.
This video watered my crops, cured my depression, and brought a plague of positivity onto my house.
Jenna: I have a plant problem 
shows all her plants
Me: I can’t even keep a fake plant how you do that?!?
Sometimes I like to come back and watch this video again just to relax
The air quality in that house must be good af
I thought she only had a few plants then I saw ᴬᴸᴸ of these 😂😂😂🌱🌱




And honestly I’m not complaining at all ❤️
Jenna cares more about her plants than I do about myself. Amazing
I blame this video for all the new house plants I have in my room and the rest of my house XD
My mum is lowkey mad at me but also impressed coz I'm actually taking care of these plants too. Also I always liked plants and flowers but I never wanted to deal with flowers at home so this video is wonderful, fabulous and exactly what I needed. Thank you Jenna from the bottom of my heart <3
Jenna: I don't know much about plants
Also Jenna: Let me tell you this plant's mom's maiden name
Kermit: cries
Jenna: looks at the camera like she’s on The Office
Ok like I'm actually living for the way you care for all your plants AND animals!! In the beginning, I noticed how you're holding Kermit like a lil baby and me three sis. About a year ago, my mom found this sling to put your dog in, and I think Kermit might really enjoy it! Here's the link for one on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/FurryFido-Reversible-Sling-Carrier-Black/dp/B016QTMBUK/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=dog+sling&qid=1554859840&s=gateway&sr=8-6
 If you don't like that one, in particular, you can just search "dog sling" on any platform. Have a good day, keep up the good work, and much love.
PS please like so Jenna sees

-a fan

Edit: hehe oops, binged more Jenna after this and realized she already has one o well.. hope you’re enjoying it and best of wishes to you and your family (+Bunny now!)
I just watched 29 mins of a 32 year old wamen talk abt her plants... i regret nothing
I showed my mum this video and she laughed when you said "lily plant bitchhh" and my mum normally never laughs at the youtubers I show her so thank you for making my amazing filipino mother laugh
I can’t believe julien was that quiet during a nearly 30 minute video
I'm finally getting a real apartment in about two weeks (I've been homeless and in a motel for about 6-7 months) and the absolute first thing I'm doing is getting a new friend to celebrate this with me. I'm so hyped about it.
0:26 cermet in the background, crying, obviously... 0:33 cermet on jennas lap, eyes contently closed. X´D cracked me up!
Thanks to this video I now own a ZZ plant, a snake plant, and two pothos.
This video aged me by 20 years in the best way possible
Jenna: I’m a beginner
Also Jenna: *goes OFF about plant facts*
How much of a good person do you want to be?
Jenna: YES
when she included non-binary in the intro I yelled I LOVE YOU into my phone, she’s so pure
As far as my plant knowledge goes, there are 4 types of plants. Grass, Flower, Tree, and Green.
It was nice seeing this side of you.  You know so much about plants.  This was wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!
Jenna: “im a beginner”
Also jenna: this is my hoya compacta verigada plant and i keep it in a ceramic pot and put it in the north side so it gets good sunlight and i check the humidity of the room every day and i have a thing I bought to check if they need water-
If you’re a beginner... whats a pro
You should get a mimosa pudica aka a shy or sensitive plant, it has a defense mechanism that makes him move when it’s touched or moved. I have one that my friend named Raspucia!
whenever I need the motivation to take care of my plants I just watch this and boom motivation falls upon me
I'm not quite a 32 year old lady but the energy that this video radiates pleases me so I guess I'm a 32 year old lady now
also, I'm glad to know that I'm not the only person who names their plants.
"Who doesn't want a tree in their house": Another brilliant reminder of why primates are an arboreal taxonomic order.  Thanks Ms Marbles.
People: “how is she so famous?”

Jenna: is the only YouTuber that gives the people what they ask for
As an 18 almost 19 year old lady I found this very enjoyable and relaxing
I seriously went out on a quest to find myself a rubber tree after seeing this. And after a good month and a half of searching I am now the proud owner of a rubber tree!!
I literally love this video sm oh my God I can't wait for a part two when she gets more 🌵🌺🌿🌴
Jenna: "Disclaimer, this isn't going to be a very entertaining video"

Is currently #3 on trending
I'm a 24 year old nonbinary friend but a 32 year old lady at heart
A not problematic queen. 💗👏🏼 We stan.
Also, I work at a plant nursery in San Diego, this is amazing
I love seeing all your plants!! They are so beautiful!
And your hoyas will bloom! It took 3 years for mine to bloom but now it blooms continuously from spring to fall. <3
Had no plants before I saw this video. Now I have a room full of plants and thinking about the next ones I should buy
Wut? are you a plant lady now? xD Time does not goes in vain! <3
Wasn't expecting to love this as much as I do, now 🌱I 🍃NEED🌿 PLANTS🌵
This is my go to studying background noise. Thank you for the video version of comfort food 😂
Okay so first of all, I love that some of her plants are named after vines
Second of all, you should get a cactus 🌵 and a Venus Fly Trap
Third of all, can I get a HOOYAA (I didn’t know how to spell that so I just did that)
So basically, Jenna adopted 100 more slow-motion pets.
This is the video that finally brought me to you. Beautiful plants. I'm so proud of you.
i always come back to this video when i’m sad, thanks for being my mom
You make me want house plants, but my house is SO DARK! :(
Funny story: I started watching this at night to help me fall asleep as a joke, but now I have to play it as many times as it takes to go to sleep. It’s so relaxing and the vibes are so good and wholesome , so thank you Jenna for  helping my anxious ass get some good sleep. All my love for your plants and puppers.
“ making pots for my plants” art video please?
Is that the boxy PASTEL flannel shirt that you wore to your step grandparent's barbecue??? It looks great ;)
Ah yes
Our plant queen, Jenna
Can we just take a moment to appreciate cermets face?! 😂😂
I apparently have a plant obsession I didn’t know about. 🤔🤷🏼‍♀️
NEXT VIDEO IDEA : MAKING CERAMIC POTS FOR YOUR PLANTS
Lmaoo, Kermit on the couch at 0:29 and then in her arms at 0:33 <3
Must be a Virgo thing because I too snapped one day and now I have 19 houseplants
Can’t afford house or kids? Have you tried...





HOUSEPLANTS?!
I wanted to go get more succulents but my dad won’t drive me. Ugh
Edit: I’m going to get more plants with my grandma on friday
jenna: this isn’t entertaining don’t watch this
jenna: * 3rd on trending *
Is this what it looks like to have your own money and house as well as love plants??? Is this my future???
I love how she’s wearing the shirt Julien bought her in one of their past videos ❤️
As a Horticulture student, Jenna is absolutely doing so amazingly! Shes even naming them by their botanical names! And only killed one plant? Dude that's a talent.. Also that house is so awesome
OMG Jenna!!  (that party begonia is EVERRRYTHING!)  Welcome to the wonderful world of plants.  I love plants so much that I became a master gardener - which sounds really much more fancy pants than it is (its just a club name, literally) - but I do have a forest green master gardener shirt and name tag!  Anyhoo Master Gardeners is a club all over Canada and the USA that put on events, tour flower farms and gives unbiased advice to people about plants.  I love touring other peoples homes and gardens - its literally the BEST - kinda like going on your plant tour here via internet.  As far as your peperomia - I feel the same, least fave!  mine has been demoted to a shady corner of my house and the thing just keeps getting more bigger and beautiful-er.  GUH!  I get insane compliments on it.  Love your Red Riding Aloe - it was my fave of em all, hope i can find one here in canada.  (Birdsnest ferns are my fave)  Keep growing!
Other youtubers: DRAMA! RECEIPTS! (EMOTIONAL)


Jenna Marbles: A Tour Of My Plants
Wait, isn't that one of the shirts Julien bought her for that video?
She’s wearing the shirt Julian Got her for her bday Awwww
I honestly only saw the thumbnail for a second. Thought jenna was showing off her hand and my brain instantly assumed she was showing off a ring. My heart fell out of my body via my pores
It's spring! Do a spring flower🌻🌸🏵️💐🌼/plant hall🌱🌳! 😍 I'm a beginner in all this and ur vids are so informational AND entertaining ❤️❤️❤️
Im growing a pineapple in my room. Does that count?
I completely understand the addiction to plants! It starts with just one plant that you finally manage to keep alive for a while, and suddenly you have 57 plants, and you're like "I don't know where these all came from, but these are their names..."
All I ask is that the next ZZ plant be named ZZ Top
jenna you should look up people that make music with their plants ITS A THING ITS AMAZING!
I refuse to believe julien wasnt just watching jenna w heart eyes this entire time that’s probably why he was so quiet like her excited extremely detailed descriptions of her plants were so endearing omg
2 years ago she was shaving her eyebrows and now this 😂

no hate,, I love her!
Here I am watching this for the second time 2 months later because I’ve officially become obsessed with plants. I love this so much
Your make-up looks sooooo good! You look beautiful ...AS ALWAYS!
on another episode of jenna can make anything entertaining
I watch this video like once a week bc she has plants I have and i'm trying identify their names. You go Jenna. Plant mom 100%
Episode 2!!! I'm going to put my string of pearls outside tomorrow and see how he does.
So wholesome had to watch this a few times, makes my heart happy
Having been inspired by jenna, I now have entire greenhouse in my house essentially 😂😂 and she’s right, etsy is dangerous 😂😂
Lady at shop: How many plants do you want?
Jenna: Yes



Edit: OMG!!! Thank you so much for 1K likes! It’s the most I’ve ever gotten
I've literally never met a Virgo that doesn't love plants
You're totally a Hufflepuff ❤️
My favourite video on YouTube. AMAZING!!! I love it.
I love having lots of plants everywhere in my room and house
Omg this is such WHOLESOME CONTENT also, really impressive how much she researches her plants
After watching this a went crazy about plants in my home
I actually bought myself a houseplant and named it adam because of this video and I love her so much
The Devil: you should get a catasetum.
You would love the African milk tree! They are super easy to care for but are super rewarding. They grow tall and are absolute units
Jenna: “This isn’t going to be very entertaining.”



Also Jenna: 
This was so heart warming & inspiring! I’m here for it 💚 

#soulfood #givebacktotheearth
Most high-maintenance plant? Cermet 😂
I absolutely cannot get over Kermit in this video, oh my god.
Jenna Marbles is the Bob Ross/Steve Irwin/Mr.Rogers of our generation and I hope she knows that her wholesomeness helps this world 💛
this video cured my depression and cleared my skin🙏🏽
Always wanted house plants but never known what kind I like etc. Thanks for doing this video Jenna! I’ve purchased my first two today and rewatching your video to keep me inspired
Must resist urge to buy 187 house plants.
"Warning: This video is only for 32 year old ladies"

GASP! THAT'S MEEEEEE!
When you're audience ages with you and starts requesting domestic videos 😂
Jenna the way you talk to/ talk about your plants is absolutely beautiful. Positive vibrations are one of the best things you can give them. To me you sound like a pro in this video. Much love ❤️😍
I'm 20, but my inner 32 year old lady, loves this video.
I had to come here after aaalllll of the James Charles/Tati/Jeffree Star crap to remind myself why I support YouTube and what genuine content should look like
I have watched this video 10 times so I can decide what plants to get In  my room.
I want somebody that treats me like jenna treats her plants
Anyone else like falling asleep to this video? 😬✌🏼🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
This started my addiction to plants and watching plant youtubers
She's wearing the shirt Julien bought her in the "My Boyfriend Buys My Outfits" video!
I've watched this video a ridiculous amounts of times and it just makes me so happy💗
Ok I kinda highkey wanna see Jenna make clay pots for her plants
Ok so I caved and bought plants for my house and now I wanna know how you care for your plants so can you please do a plant care video 💚
i love plants but im more of a "this is some type of fern idk hes big and likes to have babies" type of houseplanter.
She started a new obsession of mine
Well im a 15 years old boy but im obsesed with plants i have a mini garden behind my home


Is it weird
You keep saying u think we wont enjoy the content but girlll we enjoy YOU
omg this is the shirt that Julien got for her in the My Boyfriend Buys My Outfits video and he convinced her that she's beautiful in it 😭😭
this video started my addiction. it’s been 2 weeks and i’m now a happy father to 14 different pants :)
It took my Hoya Carnosa 4 years before it started flowering, and it's now at the 6 year mark. Makes me so proud every time. I have never had much luck indoors with terracotta pots. The salt and mineral powder that draws out isn't harmful but seems to jinx me. So happy to see someone else who finds such joy in their plants, and they look so healthy. Would love future updates when they bloom
Our pride and joy (aside from our Labrador) is our avocado tree. We’ve been growing him for like 5 years, no avocado yet lol, but we actually found him sprouting in our compost bin and decided to take a risk. He’s the best! And one day he’ll supply me avocado toast 🤩
If someone else put this up, I wouldn't watch it, but for Jenna I'd watch, it's just like how you would listen to your friends talk about anything they love, no matter how random
Never seen plant videos, I don’t even own plants but yet I still watched the entire video without skipping it because I found it very interesting.
when i grow up i want to be like you
We need a spring update video ! You inspired me to be a plant mom
Hey Jenna really enjoyed watching your video,  you should name your Kente Palm Tree Clark Kent, when that person canceled their order on that poor guy you came in and saved it immediately. 💖😋😘
me: im not really interested in  having plants
jenna: post this video
me: 💐 🌸 🏵 🌹 🌺 🌻 🌼 🌷 🌱 🌲 🌳 🌴 🌵 🌾 🌿 ☘️ 🍀 🍃
You need to Triple your propagation efforts and increase your plant ordering frequency until Kermit cant tell the difference between the outside and inside. Also checkout the Rhaphidophora Tetrasperma
yooooo i big agree on rubber plants. i love them theyre gorgeous and i also love like ivy and snake plants
I'm late watching this but i loved this video. It was interesting! Please do another one when you add more to your greenhouse! 
For the outside try hostas! You can get all types of colors and they're easy to care for
I wanna be a plant in Jennas home now - dem compliments and love tho!!!!
“Complete beginner” has 9,999 plants. Knows the exact name for each and every one. Knows what each one needs. Has the drive to actually take care of plants. Hmmm
9 years ago : Charles Franklin Marbles is a Sad Sad Man

Now: Tour of my plants
Only Jenna could make a plant tour not boring 😂
That's it, I'm filling my room with billions of plants. Jenna I blame you for my new addiction 😂 I now have 5 cacti. And I'm getting MORE
Anyone notice that shes wearing a shirt she got when Julien picked out her outfits
Jenna is the BARBIE OF YOUTUBE

I swear she has done every kind of occupation!!!

Adding gardener to the list
Seriously this video is so good, this is my third time watching it. And I just got my first plant last week-- a zz plant!
For the backyard you should do a native plant pollinator habitat! You can find beautiful flowers that are native to your region to help keep the bees, butterflies, and birds thriving. It really helps the local ecosystem! You will be doing great things for the environment and also are able to enjoy beautiful results. This is what I am doing this year, our grandparents have been doing it for years (they are master horticulturists) and their yard is beautiful and just full of butterflies and hummingbirds. It's gorgeous and rewarding.
😂😂😂 7:19
Soooooo true. I’m a Virgo and I thought the same before you even frickin said it.
This vid was pretty recent but I need a summer update?? Anyone else?????
every thursday i get a video i didn’t realise i needed
Try the dyson humidifier ! Also amazing video 😂
Literally, I watch this video at least 17 times a week. Y'all I'm not kidding.
Try bonsai trees! I love them!
5:08  --  JennaMarbles looks like a hot Dr. Evil in the sunlight...*pinky up to mouth..."One Million Plants"
honestly the blend between pure scientific facts/biological names of plants and vine references shows nothing but ~✨👌🏻TASTE👌🏻✨~
I just love how Jenna treats these plants as if they're her children or her pets


"You're so cute how can you be that cute"
"I just think he's so beautiful and  "
"I just took a minute to appreciate just what a special lovely wonderful plant he is"
"he's just happier and I want him to be happy"
"my favorite most amazing beautiful love of my life"


lol she's just great 
and this was surprisingly an interesting video considering its a 30-minute video with no other content except plants
This is my absolute favorite video on the internet.
Please post more videos of your plants❤
Jennaaaaaaaa you’ve gotten me to love plants so much from just this video and every video makes me so happy 😊 thank u!
Jenna saying she’s just a beginner but knows more about plants than I will ever know
Jenna you should name the special plant the one that you can't think of a name for Demetri (Da-Meat-Tree)
A story in three parts:
- Jenna says 32 year old ladiiies (autolike, I'm 32)
- Jenna talks for thirty minutes straight about plants and pots and recovery, and humidity, and keeping a whole greenhouse alive, with Linus names and shit and I'm like :o
- I cry in the corner because I can't keep a single plant alive and I need to search for them in Portuguese because local florists don't know which can't kill my cat
I thought it was exploring my pants
“ and I love him”





Every time
This is the most 32 y/o woman thing Jenna has ever done. Well done sis
I thought the title was ‘a tour of my pants’

...
WHY?!?
Thanks for acknowledging your non-binary friends, Jenna!!! Loves loves loves
To increase humidity set the plants in a tray of pebbles and filled with water. Also you should try Fittonias. They love low light but needs high humidity so its idea to keep them in terrariums. Also try ferns for tropical look, they're much easier than palms and tolerate lower light as well. Much love and this vid is amazing!
You know when you a fan when you watch a 28 min video about plants 😂
how many plants i had when i first watched this video: like three
hoe many i have now: like twenty, and they all have names
The only plant she’s ever killed was a golden pothos? I’m so impressed that she managed to keep everything alive but the easiest plant 🤣
21:17 is so adorable. Marbles and Peach 🤭😍
You should but cactuses on the windowsill in your bedroom. Or would the mostiture be to much for them ?
I cant help but appreciate the amount of positive energy and love she give to her plants
Me: I can only grow cacti because I only ever water them when I remember to (so, like, once every 2 months).
This is amazing. I wanna have this plant knowledge!!
I didnt expect this much information from this video and you are sooo funny! I love how your love oozes out to your plants! 🤣🤣🤣 hahaha
Tbh I thought this was gonna be a video of marbles
She literally knows so much and her little crystal water sprayer and just omg she is adorable
Her plants are all growing so well because of the insane amount of love she gives them😭❤
i just realized that's the "preppy" shirt julen got you hahaha
You should buy a rafflesia. 

I'm just saying.
These plants are totally my style.
When I move out I am going to watch this again and buy allllll of these plants 🌿☺️
This is the wholesome content I signed up for
Looks like I’m a 32 year old lady that looks 16 but is actually 23
OMG I ADORE THIS CONTENT I NEED MORE OF THIS
Your house is literally a dog and plant rescue 😭💗
I actually really enjoyed this
Jenna: definitely not an interesting video just a 30 year old reviewing plants 

YouTube: 👏#3👏on👏trending
ok so 
i've been watching you since your how tos,  but I've never commented BUT THIS VIDEO.ohmfg 
it's probably my favorite ever, with your 200th coming in at a close second.
I just got into plants too because I started volunteering at a botanical garden and aren't they just the best.
anyway
because of my recent new interest, I listened to this podcast about trees. and I just thought you might enjoy it too. 



thanks for doing you gurl
this video was hella informative andd enjoyable
I am 17, but on Wednesdays i am 32
My type of video. 🌿

Lovely collection! You are such an Elven soul. 🌸🍃 Your plants are thriving with your love.
I actually enjoyed this
“this will not be very entertaining” on number 3 trending
0:27 look in the background 😂💀
This video brought me so much joy that I decided to become a plant mom. My sister had a succulent that was very near death so I decided to bring it back to life and see how that went before I got some more plants (I'm an aries so....commitment to consistently checking soil moisture can be a problem) and my succulent is doing so well now! I also now have a basil plant which is sprouting its first few leaves and I just got an azalea! Thank you so much Jenna for this amazing video!
I have several plants including a Majesty Palm, white bird of paradise, Golden Pothos. Luckily where I live we have winters with no lower than 30% humidity and summers with 100% humidity. But I really want a Monstera Deliciosa
If you smell the string of pearl flowers they also smell of cinnamon c:
Can we just appreciate how Jenna is on trending just for making a 29 minute tour of her plants edit: wth 1k likes thank you~!
The Boston accent jumped OUT!
00:05 "nonbinary friends that like boring domestic things" I feel included
jenna your eyebrows look so good!!!
The palms name should be 🥁🥁🥁 coconut 🌴 🥥 yeeeeee
Watches Jenna. 
Takes notes. 
Goes to buy plants. 
Me to Lowes associate: "I'm no expert but this Hoya has been severely abused!"
1:55 she’s finally lost it.  She was a crazy dog lady and now she’s a crazy plant lady.
im a professional ecologist and im impressed . by you knowledge and skill!
Is this a 30 year old lady thing? I turned 30 and started to get in to gardening.
Ohmagawwwdddd I LOVE begonias!! I have one that looks like the angel wing variant, but the leaves aren't as smooth
The air in their house must be crisp™️
with all the stuff going down in the booty guru community, its good to come back to our QUEEN booty guru, the best of the beautubers, the goddess of beautiful people land, and our favorite ~32 YeAr OLd LaDy~
The next addiction level is when you start planning your meals around potential plants (ex. Buying pineapple for my fruit because I want to grow the tops)
Jenny you are so lovely, thank you for sharing your precious plants with us, You are such a wonderful, bubbly person, and your happy mood is contageous!!
Thanks for my new addiction
Ummm Jenna Marbles, I am not sure if you know this but, you are Jenna Marbles therefor this will be entertaining.
I love seeing Jenna so excited over something like plants,
even tho seeing my mom like that makes me annoyed..
Lol.
Not really thotho. I love seeing my mom having fun buying and planting plants.

This video is also really relaxing, and made me appreciate the beauty of plants even more.

I somehow see myself in Jenna's position in the future...
Jenna didn't use to be into gardening, but see her now.
I haven't really been either, but I'm slowly getting there I think.
Never gonna be a better carer for the plants than Jenna thothotho for sure, hahah.
Did anyone notice she's wearing the least favorite shirt Julien bought her in the, "My boyfriend buys my outfits" video? It looks great on her, he was right!
Imagine meeting this pure human in real life. I would die
Jenna:talks about Rubber trees like nobody EVER has a tree in their house

ME:OH MY GOD THIS IS SO COOL

AlSO ME-(when it is not  in the morning):THAT IS JUST LIKE CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME,THAT’S EVEN BETTER!!!
"I don't know much about plants....." 

Reels off Latin names like it's ancient Roman times 

You go girl!!!

EDIT: Thanks for likes!!
Mother of cermets plants and YouTube 💕💕
As a recently self proclaimed plant lady, I can relate to all of this. I love that you care so much about plants and needless to say, your house is ahaaamazing!! We should all care just a little bit more about plants and trees, they give us oxygen, literally that one thing we really cannot live without .
Two months later, fully addicted to house plants now I have 30+ plants 🤪
I bought 12 plants because of this video 😂 ive been meaning to get some anyway tho. My air is pristine yall
You skipped over Marbles who basically exists as a plant right now.
jenna: posts literally anything


me: thats how you do it queen magnificent PERFECTION
I would definitely recommend a channel called Summer rayne oaks. She has a love for peperomia plants but also has information on alot of different other plants as well. Check her out!
You being a multitasking mom, holding your newborn Cermit, talking about your plants. Beautiful.
Plant: does nothing
Jenna: you’re so gorgeous, and you’re doing so well, and I love you!
Jenna— “I’m a complete beginner”

Buys literally 200 plants
The only Hoya I have ever had is just in a jar with water...it’s been alive for years...do I have a magic Hoya?
Fun fact - pothos do great with aquaponics too! IE growing in a fish tank 😊
Be careful with the bird of paradise if it blooms the flowers could hurt the puppers
Why do I love jean-wearing, pastel button up, plant mom Jenna?
can we name the beautiful palm in your dining room "Sean Palm" :) i think its fitting for his beautiful big personality <3 love you Jenna and you've inspired me to get more houseplants!
I watch this video every time I want to buy a new plant (7 since the video was posted) ❤️🙏🏻  also, we need a part two!!
sis you aint lying... Etsy is DANGEROUS
I used to work at a plant nursery and you have no idea how hard it was to leave work empty handed
I, too, have named one of my plants after a vine: Renata Bliss, freetstyle dance teacher
Nobody:
Jenna: runs the Rainforest Cafe and turns 1 plant onto 5
(It’s the too much gene)
I am learning so much!!
I watched Jenna snort chocolate when I was 12, you're damn right I'm gonna watch a 30 min plant tour from her too.
I've watched this video every day this week cuz it's so good and relaxing
cermit just like "BREH"
Literally Every Plant:
Jenna: AND THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE
Best video I've watched in like,,,, ever. So many pretty plants and so many useful tips!!
This is one of the cutest things I've ever seen. <3
Also, check out Hoya Meredithii, Rotundifora, and Callistophylla! Those are the three I just got, and I KNOW you will love them!
I think it’s just so great that the way Jenna talks about her plants is like how Steve Irwin talked about animals 💕💕 (rest in peace Steve Irwin)
It just occured to me,

I think it would be a great idea if you went over to watch videos from "Self Sufficient Me", his videos are very informative and relaxing to watch, it's all about growing your own food in your backyard!
I thought it would be a nice suggestion since you showed so much love for your plants, I'm sure you'd be successful growing your own food as well! <3

P.S. I like to call him "the Bob Ross look alike Steve Irwin of Gardening"
you should get a catmint plant for your wineroom, since they grow in the cold
This is really wholesome and relaxing.  I've been watching some gardening life hack videos by Blossom and I'd love to see Jenna recreate the hacks.  Love the plant videos <3
what are the websites you mentioned? I buy from Etsy and the sill and I have other monthly subscription boxes for plants but I heard "low juice"? I need to know!!!!!
"idk why you guys would wanna see this, this won't be very entertaining"

Here’s a closeup of poison ivy house and her babies




BTW if you don’t know who is poison ivy she basically a crazy plant lady
Also... so glad I'm not the only one who names my plants haha
Yelling about house trees is exactly how I feel about rubber plants too
She‘s so loving and caring for everything, plants, dogs, fish, hamsters, just basically any living thing.

Now can you imagine being jennas child?😂
0:40 her rainforest cafe can be called
 “Jenna’s Ratchet Rainforest Cafe”
people have fortnite for their ecstacy

this is my ecstacy
This video has seriously struck an addiction... I’ve bought 5 plants just within the last day...
"sometimes I like to take my plant into the shower with me" LOL
Jenna Marbles is the Steve Irwin of Plants <3 And I love every second of it!
I don’t know how you do it but you can make a video about literally anything and I’ll watch the whole thing
Everything looks great! You have a "green thumb"! 
I need to get some more plants!!
Omg this is the most entertaining plant tour! You're so funny! Thanks for sharing. ❤
Damn gurl the air in your house must be hella fresh
I want a nerdy plant gf to talk to me about all her plants
honestly it makes me so happy to see jenna beaming with pride over her plants. there isn't a living creature she wouldn't care for :))
Why is this video so damn relaxing??? I've watched it ten times.
This video has single handedly launched my obsession with houseplants. Love you Jenna ❤️
ESF student, love it
Your house is so beautiful please do a house tour!! I’m moving in a few months and I LOVE the way yours is decorated ❣️
Other youtubers: doing everything they can to get anywhere
Jenna: p l a N T
number 3 on trending
Just bought my first home and this inspired me to mostly use plans for decoration. This video brought me peace, I hope to one day be as fun, kind and versatile as Jenna
"too much" gene 
(I have it too lol)
can we have a house tour next!!? also i love your plants :') and i love this video so much.
Ok so i found you on the "gardening topic" thing on youtube and you were the most popular video. I can see why because your personality and charismatic attitude are the bomb but im bummed because i thought that this was about to be a sick ass gardening channel and hort channel. Its still dope, just was hoping ya know. Thats life for ya, still sick channel
When a plant tour is number 3 on trending. Youtube is now a bunch 32 year old ladies.
How does she remember all the names of the plants? Like the actual ones not like Coachella and Roberto but the scientific ones. Also how does she take care of plants, dogs, does she still have a hamster, and herself? I’d be over whelmed
This is the calming video that I needed to watch right before my finals
I love how she wears the shirt that juilen bought her
Is no one going to mention that she’s wearing the shirt Julien bought her???
I didn’t know I needed this wholesome, calming content until now
“Honestly, what the hell is going on, Kermit” 

Yep.
I love my lipstick plant!!! You can’t kill them! I put him in direct sunlight and he persisted! I have since moved him to low light and he’s a lot happier and is actually growing haha
The house/life i want 😩 I basically just want a house that’s really a garden
I want this meny plants.
Can you paint the pots with Julien for a video?

Edit : Jenna is so smart with her plants knowledge!
I'm genuinely so inspired like i have a few plants and I'm too broke to get any more :''(
I had a wonderful ivy for a little over a year before he died and I did love him and I’m sad he’s dead but I didn’t really know how to take good care of him because I didn’t do any research on him before I bought him I just kind of bought him because he was pretty and then I named him Philip but my house has gas heat so it gets kind of dry and my mom is a smoker which really pissed Philip off and I wasn’t home enough to put him in a consistent watering schedule and he was really picky about his water and sunlight so eventually he did die because I just couldn’t take care of him properly but now I’ve actually done some plant research and I wanted a ZZ plant but after I could find one I found a beautiful purple waffle she’s beautiful and I named her Penelope I’ve done a lot of research on her and am currently setting up a little area in my room specifically for Penelope and I’m really excited to see her live and hopefully I have learned my lesson and will take better care of Penelope than I did Philip
Random person: Hey Jenna will you have kids?

Jenna: I do have kids

Another random person: What are there names?

Jenna: Insert plant names
I told myself I wasn’t gonna watch this video. I caved.
Some YouTubers show off their cars and jewelry. Jenna reluctantly shows off her plant collection.
jenna i’m angry. after watching this i’ve bought 15 plants, subscribed to the channels you mentioned, and now i want more. 

what have you done.
You should try bonsai, they are my favorite of all plants
So we are going to need an update when the spring/outdoor plants are in
Only jenna can make a video about only plants and get #3 on trending

Edit: 1. yes I know its #2 right now 
2. Holy jesus 1.2k likes!?
I love this video! But I'm also also almost 30.. so...
No one: 
Jenna: I call this plant "Coachella"
Blend yourself into a plant like the chair^-^
You should get a Prayer Plant! They are my favorite, the leaves lay down in the sun and they fold up in the dark.
You're wearing the pastel step grandparents barbeque shirt Julien bought you!!!
This was so relaxing. Love it
WHY DONT YOU HAVE MORE SUCCULENTS??? 😭😭 You live in the perfect place for them!! They will thrive in Cali!! Sun is pretty much all they need to survive!!
Jenna you actually inspired me to get plants. Thanks to you my dad spent about $100 on 6 succulents, a bag of spearmint seeds, a starter kit on growing  strawberries, and a bunch of plant stuff. :) 
We are also planning to get some more plants but we jus need room in our tiny a s s house plus we will be doing outdoor plants as well. Its been years since me and my dad have done anything related to plants and im happy to get back into it. :3 
(Im definitely going to name a plant after you and juulllieeeeaaaaaannnnn (yes. That is going to be its full name too)👌)
BORING DOMESTIC THINGS?! I'm watching this for like the 6th time because you could literally talk to me about plants all day and I'd be totally cool with it
Edit: more plant videos please
I now require a “Reading mean comments about my plants” video
I miss having plants. But I adopted a cat and plants being part of my life just isn't a thing anymore. He just loves eating them.
I recently turned 21 and I feel too old, wonderful video, I fuckin love this. Please make a video of you making a succulent garden, love you.
CAN YOU DO MORE PLANT UPDATES PLS THANKS LOVE U
This was my kind of A+ content
I love how Jenna is presenting her beautiful plants and she’s just holding Kermit like a new born baby
I love how well informed you are :D and that you apparently have entered the reign of plant ladies.
Jenna, you're like the Steve Erwin of plants and I love it so much!!
thanks to this video I ordered a hoya compacta for myself. thanks for enabling my plant habit Jenna
It’s spring now so SHOW US YOUR FLOWERS AND OUTSIDE PLANTS 😍
"Oh it's gonna be like, 5 or 10 cool plants" cut to Jenna showing like 2032138213090301210238 plants
This is like a 30 minute documentary of plants😂
i've started out with a single mini orchid and she gives me anxiety every day in case im not doing something right with her
Ahh Jenna I need to know which etsy shop you are ordering plants from!
You have inspired me to get plants. I will not stop until my bedroom is a jungle. Thank you.
DaAang Jenna knowing her stuff!! 🌿❤️
me, seeing the title:
Oh, I won't like this video, it's probably boring.
me, after watching the video:
So is this a plant channel now? Because I'm down for that. I support it. I live for it.
Obsessed. Literally found a plant app game on my phone called Terrarium!!
Just a heads up some peace lilies can be toxic to dogs although I guess you already know that
ok but jennas eyebrows are lookin right
“Now you can turn one of your plants into 5 of your plants!”

“Wait... THAT’S what that’s doing?”
This is my favorite video on youtube. I've watched it way too many times! Also, you've successfully made me also a 32 year old lady plant mom
This video motivated me to get a cute little succulent and a wonderful bromeliaceae  (hope thats how you spell it i forgot)! I've never had plants! Thank you Jenna for your always inspiring content and your beautiful personality ❤
Phil Lester is quaking
two things:
1. jenna is wearing her step grandparents barbecue shirt
2. their abstract painting is hanging in the dining room
...that is all
I’ve never heard julien this quiet before
2020: We're having a baby!
You’re feeding my plant knowledge rn ❤️ loveee - ild suggest getting a Dragon Tree plant - I love when you prune it and pick the lower leaves off - much relax
I believe snake plants have been reclassified as dracena. So your sad dracena is no longer alone! Lol
I went from having no plants to having 30 lol.
petition for jenna to get a venus fly trap
Beautiful Collection!!!!
I got that same propagation station from World Market and PSA: It's only $16.99! These things ain't cheap on Amazon!!!!
this video literally cured my evening anxiety. thank you)
watching this video makes me miss my home California. Also... Jenna... my goodness, too much gene with those plants... i love it.
Zeze-plant in Swedish is called ‘Garderobsblomma’ and weird translation to English would be “Closet-plant/flower”. It’s called that because many bachelors and single men have them in their homes - since the plant doesn’t need very much light nor water, you can put keep it inside a closet (lol just kidding) I do have one myself but it’s black (Zamioculcas zamiifolia, raven)!!
UM HELLO YOU'RE WEARING PASTEL COLOURS???? CMON CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
you should name your favorite plant Ken.
Your wearing the shirt julien gave you! Thats so sweet. I love how much you know about every plant. Its so amazing how you throw yourself at this. Julien is so supportive. You guys are like made for each other. I love you guys.
Came here from @planterina. You’re delightful! 😊
I’m living for this plant video❤️❤️❤️❤️I would definitely watch more because I love the way you talk to your plants and appreciate them so much 🌱🌿🌱
jenna is the only person i would ever watch talk about plants for 30 minutes.
Loving the game of thrones references in pod and gilly please name one of your fiery red plants dracarys
Ok. I have better plants than you. I should be getting more views. But hey, you're great. Jesus bless love from india
we have a bird of paradise at my work and they are pretty easy to take care of. You will probably need to replant outside in the next year or two they grow pretty quickly! I love the name btw!!
the one time you should be glad to not have a cat, is when you own house plants..

we had one,
our 4 cats absolutely devoured it, and in just a few days

instead of a plant, we got piles of plant puke
I hope she’s on YouTube long enough to sing 75 year old ladyyyy
Jenna, you should do a video of you making macrame  plant hangers! They're fun and not terribly hard to do, and you've got so many nice big windows they would look great in..
Having a panic attack right now but deciding to watch this to ground myself and get my mind off of my fear and anxiety. Your videos are always funny and I’m a major plant addict. I’m a 22 year old lady, thank you! lol. Anyways I have a Christmas cactus, huge desert cactus, a monstera deliciosa, a monstera adansonii, two haworthia succulents, and a variegated tineke rubber tree. I have a burros tail currently in the mail on its way to me which I’m excited about.
You should get a Christmas cactus
Thank you, Jenna for opening my eyes about plants. I now have 24 of them
Everyone else: so yeah buy my merch  
Jenna: welcome to my plant tour



Holy crap thank you for all the likes 😂
I loved this. Idea!,,, I wanna know more! You have the prettiest pots for your plantsman!
Ever since I watched this video I’ve been obsessed with plants. Thank you Jenna for changing my life😂
Much love for a fellow plant mom 💖
“I’m a beginner” states all their scientific names 😂♥️
Because of this video, I'm so excited to get some plants for my apartment. Since dorm life won't let me have plants
This house is perfect for you it has so much light
MORE PLANT VIDEOS
"Warning: This video is only for *32 year old ladies*... and men and non-binary friends that like domestic things" 👏🍵
When they don’t let you into the beauty community after all these years the simple answer is to TAKE OVER THE PLANT COMMUNITY
IT'S THE SHIRT JULIEN BOUGHTT yay
Here bc ALL of the houseplant people I watch have been talking about this video
I bought 8 plants since I first watched this 😳
Omg you look so pretty!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤♥️🖤♥️🖤
It’s cute she’s so into talking about them and it’s the most quiet Julian has ever been while recording lol
I hate plants they’re  boring but after this video I can’t wait to have my own home and fill it with beautiful easy to care plants and give them all the love and watch them grow 🙏🏼
The plant mom I aspire to be🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱
omg why is jenna and julien friendship GOALS
I just got my first succulent! Also I love you guys so much!
When you dont wanna go outside, so you bring outside inside.... 😂
I can't own plants. My cats will either eat them or knock them over.

My cats don't like it when I have nice things.
Honestly since this vid has gone up I bought one of those little cactus kits to grow and he sprouted! Stanley the cactus is livin'!
I cannot with the dog's expressions <3
This is the cutest video I've ever watched. I wanna research plants now
This video is so relaxing like for real. 

Side note though: How do the dogs not mess with the plants?
I love this video so much, I have only one (well two now it cloned itself) plant but I truly enjoyed hearing you talk about yours! What they need, prefer, and get. Also if i’m not mistaken thats the shirt from when Julien bought your clothes and it just makes it feel even more wholesome and comfortable, like we really are just hanging out!
i’ve watched this video like a million times and just realised about 3000 people disliked pure wholesome-ness.
16:00 you should have put the jeans staple chair there so there's no empty space! 😂
GIRL, sometimes we aint here for the content but for you. You make anything enjoyable and hilarious.
Jenna, you look so happy in this video. You are just LIVING your BEST LIFE and I am so happy for you! Also, I love that shirt on you! Julien bought you that shirt in a different video I think, and you weren't the biggest fan, but it looks SO GOOD on you!
I just got two tomato plants their names are hamantha and scweeb
Every time my plant store gets a new type of Hoya I have to resist buying it. I just want you to approve of my plant collection. So I need all of the Hoyas.
This is my absolute favorite video! Thanks for all of the info.
JENNA can you please make an instagram for all of your plants! So than you can update us when they start to bloom and we can see and APPRECIATE!💚
Spraying mist water on them (the nursery ones) when they are in the sub burns them. Just letting ya know, lov ya girl. 🙃💙
Update on plants for (almost) 32 year old LADIES!?!?!?! PLEASE. 😁
this is the sixth time i've watched this video cause i've just been falling asleep to it, in a good way
I absolutely love your videos. I love this video. I have watched it about 10 times. It is very relaxing and calming. I have zero interest in plants or watch other people's videos on plants. It is just because you are talking about your plants and I love it.
JENNA IS WEARING THE PASTEL SHIRT THAT JULIEN BOUGHT HER IN THE “BOYFRIEND BUYS OUTFITS” FOR ME VIDEO ;-;
You should get a popcorn plant. The leaves smell like popcorn all the time and it's amazing
My bestfriend @Cherrirosee inherited tourettes (idk how to spell it) from watching this video due to the way Miss Kesha was said lmao
never seen any other videos of jeenamarbles', but I too like to watch these plant videos and I enjoyed this one very much :)
Please make another updated plant tour, girl I know you have new plants and I wanna see them. Also it would be great to see you transplant a plant. Yours all seem pretty successful
19:20 name him “I wanna be tall” ☀️
Jenna... I LOVE you, but Jenna. Start having babies or get a green house. You know longer have room for both.
If this is what being 30 is like im a lot less scared of it now
Your small sanseveria cylindrica is a fernwood mikado! Love you and your new plant babies, Jenna!! <3
Anyone have good websites for plants in canada?  ❤
cannot thank you enough for bringing logee's into my life
Jenna’s “too-much gene” strikes again!
As a 29 year old lady, who has also just out of the blue had a random "I need all the plants" switch flip on in her brain... I can say that this was very interesting to me. I'm pretty sure I've watched this about 4 times now. Will probably repeat many more times because of how relaxing this is.
Jenna, thank you so much for the podcast and for this video. I've always loved plants, but I remember growing up and being so bad at plants. You've helped me discover my love and how there is so much research so easily available. I started a Zz Plant and not but two weeks later I've already bought 6 more. I regret nothing, thank you!!
Jokes aside, I actually watch this if I’m having anxiety at night and can’t sleep. Stress dreams are pretty okay when they’re about houseplants
This video is making me want to buy all the plants, and I’ve legit melted a cactus. I have zero green thumb. I DIDNT KNOW YOU COULD GET A SOIL CHECKER!
You and julien should make ceramic prohects and you can make some new homes for your plants!
I need as many updates as possible, this video has made me into a crazy plant lady
Okay but legit,, make an ig just for ur plants. I need it in my life. I need updates on all those bad boys.
I love plants too, did you know pothos just want to die?! Look it up:)
I love this! This is gonna be me soon. #plantaddiction lol
I hope when I die I reform as a plant and is takin care of by jenna
i was inspired to get a few house plants of my own! i got a gorgeous calathea freddie plant (he’s my favorite), a jewel of desert ruby succulent, and a spring beauty succulent! i also have a lil air plant chillin on some rocks.
YOU CAN CALL YOUR KENTIA PALM KEN
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY AGE
This was both informative and inspiring.
she’s wearing the shirt julen bought for her aww
What moisture meter do you like best?
5:08 next video: A Tour of My Trees In My House
You missed a huge opportunity by not calling this "tour de plants"
While Tati is ending careers I’m over here watching Jenna and her plants again. Because this is unproblematic and very informative. And great for the environment
Jenna single handedly made the plant business boom. 🌱
Haha aw yay I’m genuinely a 32 year old ladddyyyyyy! 🎉❤️❤️ Also I have a black thumb and kill all plants 😭thank you for teaching me your secrets 😍
My best friend has gone plant crazy because of this video...
Please do more videos! This video has gotten so many people into plants including me! Id love to watch you just talk about your plants, do’s and dont’s, etc!!!
My monstera was a rescue from Lowe’s too! He was abused but now he’s thriving and shooting out new leaves. :)
I didn’t think I needed this but my god I NEEDED THIS
I've watched this so many times and now have a wild urge to get a plant
Jenna’s the only person who would make me want to watch a video about plants
This is a great video to watch with a mcmuffin
Bunny is obviously a carrot
Her eyebrows look so good in this video
Oh my god this inspired me to become a plant person (I’ve had some succulents for a couple years but now I’m so hype to get some more plants)
"you're the best plant ever" Jenna to every plant
“I’m a complete beginner...” 
*Makes almost a 30 minute video do showing every plant she owns*
JENNA I think you would really like a Tradescantia "baby bunny bellies" plant! I'm not sure how it'd do in Cali, since I live in NC with one. But I just LOVE MINE! It's viney and velvetey, with leaves that are green on top and purple underneath.
ps. I love hoyas too!! I have one that was the first one I got to pick out myself <3
We Stan a good plant mamma
My dad had a curly spider plant (I think) for as long as I can remember until it died like 2-3 years ago!
Jenna hyping up her plants is the energy i want to see in 2019
I HAVE A PLANT NOW BECAUSE OF YOU!!!!!!! HES A VARIEGATED RUBBER PLANT LIKE YOURS.
HES A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND GROWING AND THRIVING
IM TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND IM STRUGGLING BUT HES OKAY!!!!
this is the purest content ive ever seen in my whole life thank you for sharing your love for plants jenna
I am now motivated to water my plants. That’s a new feeling.
19:05 name him Clark so his full name is Clark kent(iopalm) (sorryidkhowtospellit)
“I don’t know much about my plants” 
literally tells a whole wikipedia about them 😂
This was really cool!! It made me want to have plants in the house. I’ve always wanted an outside garden since my grandma has always had a beautiful garden.
@jennamarbles also, asclepiadaceae facebook group is bomb.  Asclepiadaceae siam group sells, stapeliads, Ceropegia, and Hoya's .
STRAIGHT👏KNOWLEDGE👏
Haha I'm 31, but I love gardening and have a ton of plants in my home:)
Such calming content that I didn't know I needed! Also that is the quietest Julian has ever been. Lol.
Jenna got me back into house plants. I went from having 3 plants before this went up to atm I have 30+ plants in my bedroom.
I have a philodendron.
Found it on the sidewalk,  had been yanked from it's soil.  Just laying there dying.
So, I decided to give it a strong name for luck:
James Earl Jones.
JENNA WORE THE SHIRT JULIEN BOUGHT HER
Well, I now have a wish list on Logees.
Is Jenna wearing a PASTEL BUTTON DOWN and a PAIR OF JEANS 


WHO IS THIS AND WHAT HAS SHE DONE WITH JENNA
i’m so impressed that jenna knows so much about plants💀
Yessss Jenna I LOVE it!! I share your obsession as well. I'm 31 and I had the same trigger go off in my brain and I went from a couple of little succulents to having probably 20 or so houseplants indoors as well! It's awesome!! Soooo much fun and pretty. :)  Does this mean we're old now? Lmao
Это самое прекрасно-расслабляющее видео, что я видела))/ This is a very good-relaxing video/
Omg this is now one of my favourite videos youve made, the love and passion you have for your plants is amazing and really encourages and inspires me to follow my own plant passion!
Beautiful plants 💜
Avengers trailer 1 on trending 

Jenna introducing us to her plants 2 in trending 

What has YouTube become
Is there a website someone would recommend regarding house plants? I have seemed to kill my ZZ plant and I don't know how or why and I keep getting conflicting information on the internet :(
im not sure why but this video just calms me down and makes me soooo happy
No bonsai, no good.
one of your best videos ever
This video has such kind and wholesome energy
I just realized this is one of the shirts from the boyfriend buys my outfits video 😢😢
We need another plant update!!
We have a rubber plant in our house that's older than me! (I'm 23)
Yo plants are people too 💚
Please do a video painting some terracotta or ceramic pots for your plants! #BotanistQueen
I live in an apartment that gets like no sun so this video is so relaxing to me ❤️
THE RINGS ❤️
I thought I was the only one who named my plants crazy names! Lol... The first one that I named was "Gary"... he's a Purple Heart who lives in my bathroom. ;)
You should make your own pottery for your plants
Jenna: “I’m a beginner y’all”
Also Jenna: lemme tell y’all about 37 varieties of a hoya
YOU SHOULD WAX TOUR WHOLE BODY
She treats plants with the same care and respect as animals and other people and honestly that just goes to show that she is the most compassionate and wonderful human being on this planet
Why is this vid a mood NO ICONIC
I love how she’s wearing a “preppy color”. It’s the shirt from her bf buys me outfits. I love her in the bright clothes it just brings out her eyes
I have been watching Jenna since 2011 and I feel like a grew with her from that angry college girl to "I just want to live my calm happy life" and I feel the same happened to most of her audience lmao
Björk litteraly means birch.. so to me that's a weird name for a plant that's not a björk 😂
I loved this omg if you get new plants please do another
This is one of my favs of your videos. It’s really calming and informative
I'm 20 and deeply offended you thought I wouldn't want to chill on my deck, smoke a bowl and watch a 32 year old lady talk about plants.  :-}
I showed this video to my mom and she said “ I really like the plant lady video you sent me” 😂😂😂😂😂
I aspire to be at this level of plant ownage
Jenna pushing Julien’s limits with plant children until he gives in and lets her finally get a cat.
I don't own a single plant because my cats will destroy them... But I just spent 30 minutes watching this. 😂
Loved this video! Im surprised you don't have any dieffenbachia, it would probably do well in that corner.
When you tell the stories of the plants that been done dirty I get sad. I’m sad about plants.
Next plant you kill you should have a funeral.
She forgot about her prized vegetable that she’s been growing for a decade: Mr. Marbles
I need that shelving unit on wheels that she has in her dining room. Also all those plants
Everytime I read that title it comes out as 'a tour of my pants.' I'm a 67 year old female so I don't want you in that way, but it kept cracking me up and I thought it might you too.
This video got me obsessed with plants and I got 3 about a month ago
Best. Video. EVER!!!🤯❤️😻
Oh these are such precious children. I have two of my own names Medli and Makar.
Jenna doing a 30 minute video about plants is my forever mood
I want someone to love me the way Jenna Marbles loves her plants.
I (zoom) went from 3 to 19 houseplants after watching Jenna swoon over her Hoyas.
The way she gives live to all of her individual plants is so cute
Your audience is growing up right along with you that’s why we’re interested in your plants!
I'm still kinda shock. Jenna knows the names of each of her plants!?! I can barely remember the names of my actual human family
Jenna I love you can you please do a beautuber video on your skincare routine/ makeup?
Jenna, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME. I've officially become an ADDICT to plants. And it's ALL. YOUR. FAULT. (((thanks♥️)))
This video is how I discovered I like plants. I bought a golden pothos and a zz plant. And I know what those names mean
Jenna, I'm currently listening to this whilst playing Minecraft and it's the most soothing experience I've ever had. You're such an intelligent and thoughtful person and watching how invested you are in your plants gives me hope that I can have a satisfying and stable life when I'm in my thirties. Plus, your acknowledgement on non-binary people always makes me feel so special. Thank you <3
Pleasee do a part 2 to this in like late spring or summer so we can see how all your plants are doing and what new ones you get
Have you heard of 9 o'clock bloomers the bloom at 9 o'clock
This is the video I never knew I needed. So lovely to see and learn about so many plants, and Jenna you are so adorable when you talk about them with such love and awe. Lmao I will say I did not expect the vast quantity we’d cover 😂 but I’m glad we did
I already have too many cacti that I hardly know how to take care of and this video is like an ad for more plants that I should refrain from getting
also if you want to trade hoya cuttings i have H. kerrii  and a few other decent Hoya sp.
You say it’s not a interesting or entertaining video.......Girl!!! I’m get Educated on plants 🌱!!!! 💚
A lady talking about her house plants for 30 minutes is my kinda entertainment and i strive to live the planter lover life
juliens cinematography really did youre sweet ass plants justice
I watched this outside because when I started watching it I felt like I should’ve been outside
I have hundreds and hundreds of plants I grow in my backyard.  At least 500 or more.  Look at Flowerful & Green on FB.  THAT would be a dangerous page for you lol
I am SO IMPRESSED that Jenna has memorized all her plant names. I have approx 4 plants and cannot remember what any of them are called.
ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
okay i actually enjoyed this
this video made my day. thank u.
I like boring domestic things, but I'm not 32, so I can't watch this.. so sad
I love how plant educated u are. Such a good plant mama 🌱❤️
I was 30 before I stopped killing plants on a regular basis. Then it was like my green thumb turned on. I think its a virus. I have a thing for Aloe and Orchids now.
Nice collection! My boyfriend has also HAD IT with me constantly talking about all the concerns I have about my houseplants. I laughed so hard when you went over Julien's only plant. My boyfriend is an aries and the only plant in our house that he picked out is a Donkey tail. P.s. please send me a cutting of your Philodendron micans 😜. I've been searching for one ever since our QUEEN plantarina showed hers off.
shoot. you just got me interested in plants now. laaawd why
Are you interested in adopting a 15 year old girl with a plethora or mental and physical health issues that are controlled via medications?

Ok, ok so real talk I wanna see more of your plants.
everything about this video radiates positivity and makes me wanna buy a plant
Man i wish i could have this many plants ♥ this was a really awesome video jenna
I just got my first succulent today while getting succulents for my mom with my dad. It’s tiny but I love it. I named it Imposter Cactus. Any tips on how to take better care of it?
Bless you, Jenna
You must water your en Cermet or else he will not grow
get you someone who loves you just as much as Jenna loves her plants.
MORE PLANTS PLEASE LOVE THIS
this was literally the most wholesome content ive ever watched
Just make sure you don't plant Sago palms outside, they are extremely toxic to dogs :) I kill cacti lol
3:03 Cermit looks absolutely dead.
I love that pastel shirt your best guy friend bought for you
Can you do a list of all of your plants, with their names?
We need more of this content for sure👌
this is the shirt julien got her in the boyfriend buys my outfits video. im crine
So I’m revisiting this video and for the first time in my life it’s painful not being able to like the video twice❤️

I just hope when I’m a 32 year old lady I’ll have this peacefulness and The ability of endless love and nurturing🙏🏼
I loved her since the beginning, my respect grew after her fish video, and now I just plain want to give this woman all the awards because the amount of love and care she puts into things is amazing. You don’t memorize the names and care strategies of all these different plants if you’re just buying for aesthetic, and the fact that she researched so much about them is inspiring.
I’m enjoying listening to u talk about plants entirely too much. Wtf happened to my life
I NEED A PART TWO
this is the CONTENT I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED
Jenna easily has the healthiest, most wholesome comment section on YouTube. ❤️
Jenna please watch the movie Green Card you’d love it xox
this is relaxing
Loved every minute of this
You should get some Bacopas. They're soooo cute!
Next video. Paint plant pots. And treating the plants like a person.
It's better to take already dead leaves off because the plant will put energy into trying to save it and that will effect the rest of the plant. :) love this video!!!!!!! Makes me want to buy more plants... and I already have way to many! If that's a thing..
ooh all those plants would make a yummy salad
Why did 3k people dislike this?  Honestly people dislike so randomly
Which ones do you recommend the most for a room that doesn’t get a ton of light? 😊
She’s wearing the shirt Julien bought her and she looks so cute
This made me wish i was one of her plants, constant praise for existing lol
Kermit is on the level of relaxation I wish I could be on.
i've already watched this like 5 times i can't wait to see moreeee
Make me want to buy plants😂
These plants are probably drowning in Co2 cause Kermit can breath boi
At this point everyone is here just to hang with Jenna for a while. She’s like a good friend you see once a week for coffee. I grab my coffee and we hang out in the am before work. Since I’ve been watching her since we were both young I went threw the drunk art craze with her and now we’re both on the, let’s just collect plants and be happy
She even mothers her plants 😍😂
She is wearing one of the shirts Julien got her. 




I just noticed that...
Rip me

am only a 14 year old lady.

I cannot yet decipher the meaning behind plants.


That begs the question...

What ARE plants?

Hey! Vsauce! Michael here.

We already know WHAT a plant looks like. We know that they are green. What else do we know about plants?

Well, making a plant isn't so easy. We know that in order for a plant to live it needs sunlight, CO2 which is the stuff we exhale, 
and water. After taking in all of these, a plant produces oxygen; the air... we breathe. All of this is a process called photosynthesis. "But, Michael," You're asking, "Surely they don't do all that just for us." Of course not you fucking selfish piece of shit, they do it to produce C6H12O6 or Glucose. Glucose is a sugar- it's basically what plants eat.

But... Why?

Plants eat, but for... what? I mean, they don't eat for the same reason that WE eat- to get energy through the day- so why do they eat? Well.. What I just said was.. Wrong.

Plants eat for the same reason we eat: to get energy. No, not energy like hyperactive energy, but energy for their cells. If you look way way deep inside a plant's.. Mmmnehh- let's say the stem- you'll find a jelly called cytoplasm and a big sac of water called a vacuole. This is a plant's storage center for water. We're not here to look at all of those things, we're here to look at these things- these are called chlorophyll. 

Chlorophyll is an organelle inside of a cell, and the job OF the.. chlorophyll.. is to absorb sunlight. The chlorophyll.. FILLS a plant with green. Cells called ribosomes take the energy to the MITOCHONDRIA- or... The powerhouse. Of. The cell.


If we zoom back out we can see the plant. But now we understand the plant. We have been inside of him, and it's a little awkward because we met in the workplace and we both loved it, but we're only going to awkwardly stare at each other for days maybe WEEKS because we haven't gotten used to the feeling of "heeyy we totally had sexual intercourse.." 

Anyway, now we understand a plant.
You radiate so much love, Jenna! You’re the best
JENNA your room is a PlAnT reHAb
I now own five house plants and am getting more today......
My zz plant is not thriving 😭😭😭
my mom and I grew hoyas for 10 years and they never flowered no matter how hard we tried lmao but they got HUGE they grew all around our living room
Jenna: "Diclaimer, this isn't going to be a very entertaining video"
Video: Trends #2 on YouTube...😐 Lol
I understand you Jenna, I have a plant obsession as well 🌱🌱🌿☘🍀🌺
Jenna knows more about plants than I know about everything combined 😩
Pink house plants exists and I immediately thought of jenna
She popped off with plants facts huh
The admiration and passion in her voice talking about her plants, she sounds so happy. We love a happy and proud Jenna !!
That was very comforting and educational for me
15:39 The plant in the background to the left is literally living lmao
Jenna👏give👏me👏more👏plant👏content👏😂
I bet the oxygen in their house is CRISP
I'm a 45 year old lady and enjoy your content;-)
non-binary friends
jenna ily
Yasssss. This is a video that I can watch from beginning to end. I love your more serious videos. I think your fan base has grown up with you. We all started watching when we were younger but we are aging with you 😂😊 but don’t get me wrong your silly ones are fun too.
Ive already seen this video, but Im in the mood to order some plants online, so Im playing Jennas voice in the background, cause she understands....
Jenna: 
talks about plants for about 30 mins
video goes trending
my mom has recently gotten into plants, and my biggest fear is that one day she has just as many plants as you.
why did I find this so relaxing
Hi Jenna! Love your vids they're hilarious! You have a gorgeous plant collection! I've been looking into getting houseplants but many of the ones I'd like to have are toxic to animals. I have both cats and dogs as well as allergies. So seems like the only plants I can keep are spider plants, prayer plants and ferns. Just wondering if you have these problems as well and how you get around it? 

In other words, does Kermit try to eat your plants? Lol 

I currently have several trees I am going to bonsai and a cypress tree that I will  have to plant outside but they'll take years before I see any results. So I'm looking for another good alternative.

I know you said you're not an expert, but I think you might just be lol

Love it though! Seems like you're doing a fantastic job! And by the way, this is my first ever YouTube comment. Congratulations to you! Lol jk!

Take care and have a good one!
Can I just say I absolutely love this video. I've seen it about 10 times and it's just so nice. It got me to buy even more plants and now I'm having such a good time with them all. I love you Jenna!
You are so glow-y and wonderful and I loved hearing you talk about something you love for 30 minutes straight. Thanks for being you.
now i want to fill my house with exotic plants
You should name the palm Charles!
Just bought a Raven zz plant thanks to Jenna.
Um Oh My God! I was just watching the video where Julien bought Jennas clothes and I said to myself "wait, that one shirt looks familiar..." 
THIS IS THE SHIRT HE GOT HER THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE AT FIRST! I guess she finally realized how good she looks in it (: A+
Ok, I have officially watched too many Jenna Marbles videos in a row...  
Thanks for coming, bye.
Jenna: says video is going to be boring.
Everyone else: watches.
YouTube: #4 trending is Jenna Marbles plant tour.
Jenna: wtf
I’m completely obsessed with plants too, and have a serious problem with ordering them online. Lol I’m in the process of turning a room in my house into a full plant room, because they are ALL OVER, along with a humidifier and terrarium section. I collect Hoyas, begonias, succulents, alocasia, all kinds of Aroids, and a few other things. I also love Logee’s , and Steve’s Leaves. Lol It’s a crazy, but wonderful obsession! :) 🌱🌿☘️🌴
I had an idea after watching your most recent video. You should do a "What a person's plant means"
After watching this video and listening to your plant podcast episode I went to both of my local nurseries and got two cacti a marble queen pothos a snake plant a croton which was misprinted and I got it for 2 dollars and a wonderful little zzplant
Whoa paranormal activity caught on camera! Swear I saw the ghost of your dead dog Marbles in the bg!! Spooky!
Now that you're a 32 year old woman can we see a video of what to expect after we turn 30? I already have the fur babies and the plants are coming along and I want to know what else.
Only she can get a million views talking about her plants in under 24 hours. 😂😂 iconic
My mom has a peace lily from when her grandma passed away. It used to stay in the living room until our dog tore it up. Thankfully I was able to save part of a root and its doing well today. Not as well as it used to but definitely better than when it was in pieces on the ground. Peace lillies are beautiful though
THIS MAKES ME WANT TO HAVE SOOO MANYYYY PLANTS I LOVE YOU SOOOOOO MUCH JENNA <3
This was way more interesting than I thought it would be
Jenna! I think the plant you called a satin pothos is really a philodendron silver. I have one that's identical to yours and I read they are often confused for satin pothos <3
“I don’t have a ton on knowledge.” GURL
Other YouTubers: I DIED!?!?!?!?!?!?
Jenna: here’s my plants. Enjoy
this video is so zen and I'm here for it. we stan this amount of wholesomeness in a video.
OMG MY SISTER WORKS AT LOGEES
Jenna: this video is for ~32 year old ladies~

Me: 17 years old the perfect video for me
MORE PLANT VIDEOS
I'm watching this high af and is making me so happy
Tell us about the plants you’ve killed so I can feel validated 😫
Thanks to this video I'm now the proud owner of two peace lilies and a succulent (a sedum adolphii)
I want someone to take care of me like Jenna takes care of her plants
jenna, i’m 22 and about to graduate from college and you’ve inspired me to become a plant mom. I just got my first plant and his name is Herbert and he’s a beautiful neanthe belle 💕 i feel like i’m an addict now because i want so many more plants
She is a natural genius Plantologist!   I can tell because she cares enough to do research plus treats each organism as an individual within a group. I would go as far as to say she sees them as PETS!   I can't wait until she opens a chain of JenNurseries where we can buy our own unique Green Friends, Plus.  Managers!  Get on this!
love the name bjork, it sounds like the swedish word björk with is what birch is called in swedish. But it's also a oldschool name
Can we just take a second to appreciate Juliens self control with filming this video. I know Aries season is coming up. He did so good.



Omg I’ve never gotten this many likes on a comment! Thanks everyone 🙏
Kermit popping in and out of the video demanding attention and demanding to be held. He's such a spoiled little dog. ❤
This is so peaceful to watch
I’m 21 and I love plants 😂 they make me happy
I'm sure you already know this but just to be safe, lilies are very poisonous to cats and dogs. I'm not worried about the dogs but if you ever get a cat make sure you keep it away from your plants. I have 2 cats and they chew any leaves they can reach lol
Jenna can remember all these plant names but not Kermits birthday
Ohh, what a sweet enjoyable video! I've only recently started keeping plants (in any serious capacity), and I'm having the exact opposite problem - where I live it's definitely humid enough, but I'm having the toughest time getting enough light and heat, even though I have huge south-facing windows! I keep having to rotate my rescued monstera in the hope that his two or three droopy leaves will pick up. And of course the brightest spot is right by the radiator, so that's plant-poison right there. Really it's the only thing keeping me from amassing a forest of ferns.
I absolutely love this. This is plant goals and I can’t wait till I reach that.
BEST. VIDEO. EVER. <3
Since this video, I now own one of each of the following: echeveria pulvinata (frosty), chamaedorea elegans, dizygothica elegantissima, and dracaena deremensis. My MIL just gifted me a curly parsley plant as well c:
“Im a beginner but I know every single name of every plant and extra details about them.”
You're a wonderful person.
Jenna mothering plants is the vibes i need in 2019
That dog though...😂😂 so seeet
I love that you made a video about something I love and doesn't get attention from big youtubers
YouTubers: Soo like yeah just coped the new supreme and a new Rolex and accidentally bought a Bentley

Jenna: so um.. MY PLANTS!!
Can we talk about how nice Jenna's eye makeup looks? She did a really good job!
i’m just gonna start looking at plants differently now
Your definitely the dog 🐕 whisperererererer. lol 😂
I’m so excited to go to a cabin in Colorado this June. There’s a tree going though our deck. A TREE! GOING THROUGH OUR DECK!!!
I’ve rewatched this at least 5 times now. That’s how interesting, entertaining and soothing this video is 💛💚
She talks about her plants like they are her children😭❤️






Trick beech, THEY ARE HER CHILDREN🥰
Your make up is soo bomb
Your dog looks like bogs from gooby pls
I watched this video with my mom and she keeps laughing at Kermit
That dog is amazing.
Okay, can we talk about how good of a mom Jenna is? I can barely remember my brothers name on most occasions and she can remember all of her plants.
2:20 a simple kermit whine


next shot jenna is holding kermit X'DDD
The oil not plant we have at home is a aloe vera plant lol
did anyone realize that is the "step grandparents barbecue party" shirt lmao
I genuinely now want 50 house plants...
Jenna...i need you to do your makeup without moving the brush and only moving your face
Дженна, заведи себе Аллоэ Вера👍👍👍👍
This is SO educational and inspirational
I wish I could double like this.
Kermit is just... awesome
This video made me feel like a 32-year old lady and I'm not mad about it.
Link to the place you got the Chinese Perfume plant...please.
I got  nice  Succulent  plants  they  grow  well.....Sun comes  up  in the back  garden  ,    Sun set  in the  Front  garden  .
girl, i loved this video. I love how much you love your plants and I love that you love that begonia so much because I just bought one (and reacted the same way as you) but didn't know they needed so much humidity. So guess who's taking her little begonia into the bathroom while showering from now on :'D and now I want a rubber plant as well but I don't have any space nooooooo
the air quality in that house has to be incredible lol
I weirdly enjoyed this video
I just found out you can propagate rubber trees and I'm seriously about to snip a piece off my mom's tree rn lmao.
I came for succulents... Lol
Kermit at like 2:45 is living his life bruh
A half an hour video about plants this is what I'm here for
Anyone know the name of the song that is playing in the background?
this is so wholesome i fully support this
please do another one of these videos i can’t stop watching
My mom puts mayo on a wet napkin and then wipes the plant leaves with it!!! Makes them shiny.
I love how you lovingly  recited all the scientific names of your plants and proceeded to rant about how much you love them
This is such a soothing video! Your such a good plant mum! I now want to acquire more green children!
Why is Jenna the Steve Irwin of plants?
I believe my parents have a hoya (not sure how its spelled) and they can get huge! The tendrils kinda stick out to seek water, and you can smell the blooms a mile away. I also have succulents, and they don't really need much. The sanseveria is a succulent, which is why its easier to keep!
I’ve never had the desire to own plants until now
Your house is beautiful honey xxx 💖💖💖💖
Do more domestic things for ur fellow 30 y e a r  o l d  l a d i e s
Marbles is Bjork 

Kermit is the Palm

Peach is a Snake Plant
I've watched this video 37 times... send help... i love plants
Goes to know that I will watch anything Jenna Marbles posts
Jenna should start a program for abused plants
This video makes me so happy 🥰 if I may offer some wisdom, here are a few tips for u! (You probably know most of this but ya never know) 
• make sure you change the water and clean your propagation station regularly! Plants need fresh, oxygenated water to grow roots. And bacteria grows fast. You can add tiny amounts of Epsom salt, baking soda, and hydrogen peroxide to help them grow! Make a weak solution and let them sit overnight and then change to fresh water in the morning. 
• Whale should eventually grow another shoot, but that might take actual years lol. Go easy on the fertilizer when you use it 
• something wonderful to add to your watering routine would be to wipe the leaves of your plants (especially the larger ones) front and back on like a monthly basis! A wet sponge or soft cloth would work great, distilled/ filtered water is all you need. Your plants will be able to breathe better and they'll love you for it! Snake plants rubber plants, and peace lilies especially love this. Always wipe a new plant off when you bring it home! Don't be afraid to give em a little scrub, sometimes my snake plants need to be wiped multiple times bc they won't come clean 😂
• with Björk, a good trick is to water them the exact same amount of water; like use a measuring cup. Figure out the min. amount of water it takes to get most of the soil wet, and use a lil less, regularly. Even better, take that amount of water and make ice cubes and just put em in the pot and let em melt. 
• girl... those succulents on your bookshelves need more sunnn put em in your kitchen love. 
• peace lilies do like to dry out from time to time :) with self watering planters, don't fill them all the way; only like a cm on the bottom and let your peace lillies let you know when they need to be topped up! Letting them dry out a bit and droop is v good for them. Not so fun fact: sadly some varieties won't flower again after taking them home. Fertilizer often produces lots of leaves. They will be so happy wherever you put them. 
• have a random spot and need a plant for it? Spider plant. Have a spot where nothing grows? Spider plant. In my opinion, spider plants are the most underrated like for reeeaaallll!!
• just get one huge mother spider plant and plant the babies 3-4 to a pot. They will bless ya whole life and existence and fill ur home with so much love. Plant them with a healthy amount of orchid bark and sand, and they'll be so fkn happy oh ma god. 
• must haves in the bedroom: snake plants, peace lilies, and snake plants for the purest air ever while you sleep
• bless each of your plants with a small crystal or stone, either buried or on top. They will take in and spread the vibe 😊 they love it and appreciate it! 
• plant recommendations for you... (sorry Julien) 
• Jade!!
• Jasmine
• Lavender is nice but can be difficult sometimes
• spider plants 😍 all the different variagations are so great.
• Wandering jew! One of my favorite plants (with my least favorite name lol) easiest plant ever to propagate. I've had cutting grow roots just from sitting on the windowsill like a succulent cutting. you can stick cutting right in soil and they'll grow roots within 48 hours. 
• Lilacs! Idk if they grow in California but some would look lovely in large pots or in the yard. 
• speaking of your garden,  take a lot of hassle out of gardening and plant lots of native wildflowers for the bees! They take care of themselves. Just cut back and compost the brush every season.
• African Violetsssss GIRL. you just need one hearty healthy one and you can make so many cuttings. Cute fuzzy leaves, flowers, it's perfect for you. And they're more forgiving than orchids!
•blueberries, strawberries, raspberries... most berries grow very well in pots with trellises
• have you ever seen a staghorn fern? They are STUNNING.
• You could try growing avocados! 
• date palms
• Christmas/ Thanksgiving/ Easter cactus!!!

And of course there are so many others... don't fall too deep down the rabbit hole. 

Thank u for coming to my TED talk <3 love u jenna and I love all ya plant childrens and I hope they reach their full potential! They will take great care of you 😊💕
I've just moved, and am watching this video again because I'm excited. I have a little strip of clay soil in my backyard, and it's begging for colour. There's also a metal bar that runs along the fence that could have potted plants hanging from it.


I walked around Bunnings (the Australian hardware mecca that also has plants and weekly sausage sizzles) and saw lots of pretty seedlings for under $5, but hesitated and ended up buying $5 packs of seedlings at another store because ??


But I'm excited, I've found a couple of documents on my local council's website (on a page titled Biodiversity) that gives me lots of information about plants that are native to the area, or grow well in the area. I've got a Word document open and am making notes based on what will look/smell nice, will grow well in the area and soil type, and won't grow too huge. I mean I'm renting, but what kind of landlord is going to say no, you can't turn that clay dirt into a beautiful garden? I plan on living here for a while, so I could always remove all that hard work in the future if I do move.
name one of then Trey
SHES WEARING THE SHIRT!
Honestly I love this because of HOW HAPPY SHE IS AND HOW SHE'S LIVING HER BEST LIFE I love this so much.
I play this video in the background of everything that I do, it is so calming and nice to listen to Jenna talk about plants
More plant videos please!
Lol I have a million house plants out of nowhere too!!!
Just bought and potted a bunch of plants today. Got a rubber plant because I thought they were cool in your video. I'm excited
This video makes me want to get my life together.
I never cared for plants. Never craved one. Suddenly I bought a Aloe Nobilis at Aldi. Then mum bought me a Schlumbergera and a Mammillaria cactus. I thought that was it. Few weeks later I now have 9 plants. I'm hoping for a snake plant
The reason why your succulents are doing well is because succulents are dessert plants, this means you only have to water them once a month or two months because if they get water on a regular basis like the other plants they can drown and die cause there not used to it.😉🌱
@3:12 The dog is high on oxygen :D
I WORK AT LOGEES!!
Damn I knew she was buyin plants but shes out here BUUUUUUUYING plants lol
We need a plant update.
I am a hosta lover. I’m on the hunt for a white feather hosta. I bought a squiggly wiggly hosta and a curly fry hosta yesterday 🌱💖
name the palm tree "Palm McCartney"
I love how Julien supports Jenna and her crazy antics! 💖
I need the kind of support Jenna gives her plants
jenna when julien bought her that shirt: complains about pastels “wHaT iS tHaT” “idk it’s a little too boxy and it’s very see through”

jenna as a ~32 year old ladyyyy~
28:12 I melted.
girl you should check out false aralias they are SO cool. I can’t remember the sciencey name for it but it looks like a teeny shrub and is pretty chill
isnt this the shirt julien got for her in the my boyfriend picks my outfit video ??
SHE'S WEARING THE SHIRT JULIEN BOUGHT HER
i thought the title said pants. sorry bye.
THIS PLANT GROWS FLOWERS
For real tho, how have you not named your Kentia Palm Mufasa yet? I'm sorry, but I saw it, and that's the first thing I thought, as far as names.
1:40
Jenna: In about thirty years he’ll be a full plant
Jenna in 30 years time: this plant tour is only for 62 year old ladies

Please don’t come for me I love Jenna and I’m hoping she’ll make videos even when she’s a 62 year old lady
Anything that enters Jenna’s house gets so much love and care 💖💖
Jenna I shit you not after I watched this video three times I went out and bought ten plants. Ten. At once. You activated my too much gene and I don’t think I can deactivate it now. I just want all the plants
Did not know that Jenna was such a plant aficionado! We love plant mom Jenna <3
Jenna you are out of control with plants, your too much gene is showing XD 

Jenna is like my grandma after she died. We had to separate all the Motherinlaw Tongues because there was so f#cking many and a lot really big. Both front and back porches are covered with plants
i'm only thirty seven seconds in and i love it.
i love it when jenna has a disclaimer that a video won't be  interesting like I haven't been sitting here every wednesday/thursday watching whatever she wants to bless us with, from landsharks to turning myself into my green screen, since 2012


EDIT: wow thanks for the likes y’all!! I have a lil channel of my own if y’all wanted to check it out :)
SHE IS WEARING THE SHIRT FROM BOYFRIEND BUY MY CLOSTHES
Aw that’s the shirt Julie got you right?! <3
Do you name your plants? On the rare occasion that I get plants they always name plants haha
This video is the reason I can’t stop buying plants I just bought a $30 plant the other day 😂
This video is the definition of 𝙨𝙤𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜
The audio is kinda hard to hear on this one without the subtitles, ngl, hut I love it sm.
This video makes me feel so calm lol
You are so smart!
M S .  K E I S H A
This is low key the cutest video I’ve ever seen
Why is no one talking about Kermit?
I have two donkey tale succulents
My great grandmother has one of those hoyas (spelling? Plant name? Idk.) It flowers every year and gets little drops of nectar in the center when the bloom goes from hard and plastic-y to fuzzy. I'll tweet you a picture when it blooms!!
If you ever want a plant that can survive with no sunlight, then get a spider plant. They are beautiful and don’t need much sunlight.
Turning myself into my plant? Next video idea
So it’s been like a month and how I have 5 plants bc of this video
Why do I love this?
jenna is such a good person, the love she shows her plants is beautiful, shes wearing the shirt julien bought her, she has 500 plants in her house, the list goes on
DO THIS AGAIN PLEASE I NEED THIS CONTENT!
"I'm a complete beginner" she says as she has more enthusiasm and takes better care for her plants than my parents do of me.
Your bird of paradise plant should be able to be cut down completely in the winter and it will regrow next spring. They have tubers, so they're pretty Hardy.
Julian being friend-zoned for 15 minutes straight 😂
Jenna's videos are BY FAR the easiest to re-watch in this whole platform. I'm here now, I'll probably be here next week too
“I don’t go outside”
“I can tell”
Mood of the CENTURY
"he's so talented and lovely".....that didn't age well lol
It's been a hot minute since ive laughed as hard as i did when Julien almost died.  Thanks Julien for putting your life on the line for entertainment
So nice to see two best friends having fun
Why am I julien when he said “tf bro, did you just friendzone me”
when she started talking about james i checked the date on this video
"Remember when we got in that car accident and I didn't have any eyebrows? And the EMT was like, are you okay? Physically but also like, in general?"
JULIEN CHOKING ON THE GLOVE ALMOST MADE ME PEE MYSELF LMFAOOO
“Are you okay physically but also like in general?”  You mean in Jenna-ral ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
can we acknowledge that Julien almost choked twice in this video.
“Wake up early everyday, pop open a box of just for Julen and get cranking”
Y’all I’m wheezing
Ok so put your hair is loose braids and tie them to helium balloons and go in public
[EDIT: or just ponytails idk whatever]
“Are you taken?”
“Nah, I just have a FRIEND.”
Am I the only person on here rewatching all of Jenna and Julien' s videos until they get back from vacation? I can't wait for them to come back, I miss them so much!!
brings up James charles bruh the biggest sweet heart on the internet isn’t even following him anymore
Yikes at the james charles mention lolol
i just realised you got rid of the old squeaky intro
Does she have a fireplace playing on the tv above the actual fireplace?
Your brows have been through such a journey. Go get them microbladed!! Andddd they will finally be a shape. Lol
I love how you have a fake fire above your fire place
Julian getting friend zoned is a big mood.
The fire you have playing on your tv OVER your fireplace is iconic.
Julien getting upset when Jenna friendsoned him is really sweet
3:28 OOF the James Charles comment didn’t age well lmao
Their "friendship" is goals <3
jenna you're so pretty, with and without makeup. truly just a beautiful queen with lovely eyes.
That glove fart had me laugh way harder than I expected lmao
if you can friend-zone your boyfriend of literally 6 years you can do anything. point blank period
Jenna: uhhh, bout to do my eyebrows 😎 

Some time later: 

Jenna’s eyebrows: 😎 you was at the club...
Chemistry teacher: ok class please read all the directions of how to do the lab for tomorrow.

lab day 

 
“Are you okay physically but also like in general?”
the “~generally unmotivated~” was a mood
julien - “ so leave it on for 3 hours?”

jenna- “yeah, probably”

box- “leave on for 5 minutes”
"Nothing too crazy, but, like, I know sometimes you guys don't even care what I'm doing in a video. Like, you just wanna hang out and forget about your life for a little while."

The fact that I just spent 20 minutes watching you try to get Marble to sit and am now rewatching old videos makes this one of the most accurate comments you have ever made.
0:07 when she says welcome you see little marbles head pop up

0:38 cermet pops up out of no where
Can you do a video on microblading your brows... but go to a professional!
"For men and Jenna"

Jenna= All of the ladies who want to be a Jenna.
will someone make a friendship compilation mostly just to trigger julien
I’m so jealous of their companionship 😍 seriously goals
My dad used henna in his beard once because he was out of just for men and he thought/hoped no one would notice but when he came home from work that day my mom, brother, and myself roasted him for a solid 15 minutes when we saw his DARK ASS BEARD
“I think there’s still some left in there.”
*wipes off whole eyebrow that looked very real 😹
"I didn't read all the instructions like.."
"Nice! Me neither!"
real ares hours
Exactly, Don't Actually Care What You Do, Simply Love Your Personality! Our Ray of Sarcastic Sunshine Has Arrived ~( =
When Julien inhaled that piece of glove I THINK I COLLAPSED A LUNG LAUGHING SO HARD I-
Julien: Can you eat it?
Jenna: You can eat anything you want, Julien. It's just a matter of if you'd like to die from poison or not.
Julien: Soooooooooooooo... Yes?
I'm Dying XD 4:10
I feel like I watch Jenna when I’m just kind of overwhelmed with the drama and I just want to watch good original content
just for men and wahmen
i just gotta say, i really like when you edit little snippets of your past videos in, when you mention that part of it
3:20 - 3:30 This part did not age  well.
Julien looks like a Russian stereotype with that hat and extremely black beard.
talks about James charl-
Me: "Well this is ackward."
She either wants no eyebrows or the darkest eyebrows you will ever see in your life no in between
There is no ads ok some contexts she is the only youtuber with no ads in a long video thank you
James ain’t so lovely anymore Jenna :)
Henna tint for eyebrows video! Just make sure to shape them the way you want
Jenna: 

had a fire place

Also Jenna: 
Jenna: colors her mustache and is shocked when it dyes her skin 
Also Jenna: colors her eyebrows and is shocked when it dyes her skin again
Please stop calling Julien your friend, it hurts my heart
"Welcome to a journey of mediocrity" Is the title of my autobiography
I think her brows look beautiful and I'm kinda jealous cause with your brows you can experiment mine are bushy as hell.So just want to say that.😂😂😂
“i think mine’s gonna look good!”
2 seconds later
”oh no”
Hi Jenna. I'm 59 and my eyebrows are aweful. I'm thinkin I'm going to do what you did.
when i did a video with james charles....😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
has a real fireplace
'Welcome to a Journey of Mediocrity' - My Biography
No one:
Jenna: has fireplace channel playing on top of fireplace
Julien is actually ROCKING that black nail polish. It looks good on him. Kind of has a Blink-182 vibe.
This is my first time watching her and she's a riot and ALSO is her boyfriend George Costanza?? I'm dyinggg
That James Charles comment didn't age well lol
Their relationship reminds me so much of my own. Like is this what we look like when we interact in public. I'm ok with it tho
Why is no one talking about Julien choking on the plastic? I almost died 😂😂😂
You’re everything YouTube should be 💕
"James is so talented and lovely btw" - before the tati drama
I just saw a ad for people who have used Just for men and suffered permanent or whatever staining, burning, etc lol
Been tinting my eyebrows for months and I can say if you do it right it works Jenna leave it for only 4-5 minutes 😂❤️
Sees a fireplace on the TV

Okay



Okay
6:05 when the camera starts zooming in sinc to cermets barking and into jenna absolutely done face😂😂
Fire place channel on tv above a fireplace. Nice.
"A journey into mediocrity" will be the title of my autobiography
Insane annoying drama with the beautubers, time for some Relaxing Time With Just for Wammen
"I know you guys just want to hang out and forget about your life for awhile." Hitting a little too close to home, Jenna
It's exam day and I'm exempted from it so I'm trying not to actually laugh out loud and disturb the class and it's turning out to be really difficult
I started crying when Julien inhaled that piece of glove 😂😂😂
"I think mine is going to look good"
... "Oh no" 
..... "Oh no oh no " 
😂😂😂😂
“My gum came back” 
This literally killed me!😂😂😂😂
13:07 Peach actually has tiny dark eyebrows. She looks just like her mother.
Does she have a video of a fireplace over her fireplace???😂
When Mykie gets back from her break from Glam and Gore, JENNA NEEDS TO COLLAB LIKE OMG PLEASE GAWD
this video is like 2 months old but i’d like to tell a story...

i dye my eyebrows dark brown to match my dark brown hair (i’m naturally blonde). and recently the target near my house got renovated, it looks real nice & they added a starbucks. anyways, now there’s like a whole ass isle of men products. it’s very hyper masculine, girls ain’t supposed to be there type thing. so i wanted to get my just for men & jenna, and it was in the isle of dude shit. so i walk over, and i can feel all these eyes just watching me like, “what the fuck is this teenage girl doing in the men’s isle”, so i try to get my shit as quickly as possible. it was a fun experience that reminded me of why i never leave my house, the end.
the only drama-free beauty guru on youtube
my husband and I friendzone each other all the time its fine...  its fine..   it's great dude.
“so talented and LOVELY” and yet, the tea is scalding anyways.
You probably have already seen this many times but I just feel the need to help. Next time you try to dye anything and try to put vaseline on your skin so you won't stain it, I hear that helps prevent staining at least. 😁
Is that a video of a fire place

Above your fireplace
Jenna: Ya NOT just for men your for MEN and JENNA and whoever else would like to embark on this project
our favorite best friends back at it again 😂
2:40 when you have a chem lab 😭
microblade yor brows and take us with you!
Jenna: "i think mines gonna look good"
      1 second later
Jenna: " oh no!"
Has a fireplace on their tv over an actual fireplace
That “Are you okay, physically and in general” I felt that
u should make a bar of soap that looks like kermit
I kept seeing comments on other videos about them being just friends and legit was terrified to the point of dreaming about it last night. I’m glad I have answers now. Please don’t break up.
I think it would be really cool to see microblading on you, if you wanted to try it!! 💜 you!
lmao youtube recommended this bc she says JC in the video.


the algorithm is evolving...
“Sometimes you guys don’t even care what I’m doing in the video. You just came here to hangout and forget about your life problems” 

you have no right at calling me out like this, Jenna


Where do I go to link my soundcloud?
She screamed "JUST FOR MEN" in such FEMINIST way, you know it's true.
“He’s so talented and lovely” PFPFPTTPTP
I feel like Julian is going to give me a prostate exam
next up: becoming wednsday addams by jenna marbles
wow i love this friendship
Literally nothing:
Kermit: *cries*
Everyone's over here talking about James and all I can think about is that there is a fake fireplace going above the real fireplace...
The thumb nail looked like she was Post Malone😂
"YES I CAN! I'M GONNA PULL IT OFF" 😂😂
Jenna: has a fire place
also Jenna: puts fake fire on tv
They are Goals in life... have been for forever🥺
Dood get your eyebrows micro-bladed for a video!
0:08 ~Jenna-rally unmotivated~
I literally sprayed water everywhere when Julien nearly died on the glove 😂
”Welcome to a journey of mediocrity” my autobiography
I say this with all the love in my heart but why does Julien look like Radar from MASH in this video
Did anyone else notice Julien's stellar mani?
🎶O BABY YOOOOU YOU GOT WAT I NEEEEEED BUT YOU SAY HE JUST A FRIEND BUT YOU SAY HE JUST A FRIEND🎶
I like how they have a video of a fire place on top of their fireplace 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Billy Ray Bits is clearly a breakfast cereall
While Jenna was dying Julian's beard I was focused on his beard and I looked back at Jenna's eyebrows and said "WOAHHHHHHHHHHHH JENNA"
Video of a fire playing over a fireplace
“This is a snacccc that’s been served on a dish” 😂😂😂
I've definitely shaded in my hubby's beard  for cosplay reasons.
When I saw this I thought it said "A relaxing time with a man" So I clicked to make sure
I got my eyebrows tattooed. Best decision ever. Rubbed acid on one part on accident one time, so I only had half an eyebrow for ever and the hairs never grew back properly.
If only she could just for men marbles.... he needs it
"You taken?"
"No, I just have a friend." 😂

God I love them. 😂
best part of whole video 9:38
2:55 "What aM i Even Doing w// My Life" xP
Who else wathcin but u a gurl
This was a fun time, really! I like the darker brows on you, too. I used to dye my brows when I dyed my hair at home (not with Just For Men, face-safe dye though, woops) and learned that putting Vaseline on the skin around your brows and along your hairline helps prevent your skin from getting dyed!
Julian: try’s to inhale plastic off finger 

Also Julian: is surprised that he choked on said plastic
mr. marbles in the background early on 💕
You Know Guys, He Probably Just Used Water to Wash
I love everything you do on your channel, and Julian is in the back supporting you 😂❤️
Is that a video of a fire in the background?
"You can eat anything you want, it's just a matter of whether you want to die of poison or not."
                - Jenna 2019
Friendship goals uwu
You and Julian's relationship is just to fricking cute!! This video is the perfect pick me up I needed. I just love watching you two!
Such a iconic duo! "Are you friend coming me' 🤣😂🤣😂
I also feel unmotivated.
ten minutes after the hardest college exam I’ve ever taken
Jenna: sometimes you just wanna sit back and forget about your life
me, crying: she gets me
7:32 i saw that coming
9:07-9:30
9:37
They’re amazing 😂
Why is your boyfriend literally Radar from M.A.S.H.
Julian Looks Exactly The Same
Wow I ship these friends so much
A paste made of cigarette ashed and water removes dye. Old  school tricks.
You look great in camouflage.😁
COUPLE GOALS oh myyyy gawwdd! this is why I love you both !!!!!!!!!
Thanks for making my weekend 10000times better 😆😄
jenna is an actual representation of my last brain cell strugglingg
“My best friend is so stunning”😂
Can you please do another Google deep dive!❤
I started watching this at work, and quickly realized that I cannot watch this at work. 😂 lmao
chain reaction

10/10 fire
I love how she just has her tv playing a fireplace video
When She Slaps Him, i'MMa Laugh xP
Y'all could literally talk about and do absolutely anything. We just wanna hang out with y'all. 😂
”UM THATS IT”
"JENNA-rally unmotivated"
I legit LMAO at Julien almost dying nothing personal bro
I love the "let's just hang out" videos, you're awesome Jenna, and you are beautiful

Julien being continuously triggered by Jenna calling him her “friend” is me asf.
‘You just wanna hang out and forget about your life for a while’ 
100% 👌🏻
“I don’t go outside.”
“I can tell.”
😂😂
Here because I want to hang out and forget about my life for a while 🙋🏽‍♀️
Drinking game: take a shot every time they say "nice" in this video
In the next vid, make each other FriEnDSHip bracelets 😍

My ocd is cured and very pleased that this video is exactly 15:00 seconds 💕
“Today is not the day for reading” a mood if there ever was one
idk if anyone’s said this already but...
Just For Jen(na)
** Julian getting triggered by the word friends**
i love that there playing a fireplace video on the tv even though they gave a fireplace right underneath
Flashback to the second video involving Julien while he was in the friendzone...
Suggestion: Full head of 90s hair wraps
Imagine having to explain to an EMT how Julien choked while sucking on a glove with just for men all over his face tho
I'm embarrassed to admit that this is the first Jenna Marbles video I have ever seen 😬 I'm not disappointed!
Next vid: MICROBLADING!!!🤡🤡
The way he got triggered when she said the word “friends” is the SAME WAY my boyfriend gets triggered when I accidentally call him “dude” 😂😂
He hates it😂
Youyyyy arrrre so beautifulllllll 


TO MEEEEEEEEE 
Luv u Jenna
jenna and julien friendzoning each other is the funniest thing and one of the reasons why i love them so much omg

I love how Julien got triggered when Jenna called him friend 😭😍
Painting your aries' beard for him
Did anyone catch the parks and recreation joke?
I'm enjoying Julien so much more since he became a rampant stoner
Good to See They Grew Back From Shaving.. Was Worried a Little Bit
"You can eat anything you want Julien it's just a matter of if you want to die from poison Or not"
I actually laughed out loud vocally when julien swallowed his gum the 2nd time 🤣
Omg jenna a guy in my class has the Same eyebrows so we call him half brows lol
"I know that you guys don't even care what I'm doing in a video like you just wanna hang out  and forget about your life" 
 


yeah that's me
I always address it as just for men and Jenna 😂😂 anytime I see or hear just for men 😂
I love how triggered julien got when she called him her friend 😂
"you just wanna hang out and forget about your life for a while" oh HELL yeah while i'm finishing this bottle of wine
Julien...if you are going for 'serial killer' in this, you did good.

💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
11:14 “The problem is, I also dyed my face”. 😂 😂 😂 
Dyed laughing for 10 minutes after that line!
I´m having a really stressful time at the moment.. my parents are moving, i´m also moving to a different city and my bachelor thesis is also due at the end of the month an i just wanted to thank your for making such videos! They alway cheer me up and let me forget about the day and all my responsibilities 
looking forward to your next videos :)
Jenna: I know you guys don’t care what I do in a video, you just wanna hang out and forget about life for a while.

Me: literally doing just that 😭😭😭
The TV is ON! @-@

I almost died 😂😂
You both look Amazing! 💜😊
Facial hair: dyed 
Nails: done
Hell: yeah

Girl your eye brows are beautiful. I’ve been where you’ve been and when you finally accept them and start to love what you have they start treating you right.
Just for Menna: A series 💁🏽‍♀️
Omg I loved this video Jenna! You guys are so funny 9:36 I know I shouldn't be laughing but omg I'm dying 😂 😂 😂 love you both so much 💕 💕
Damn, I feel like such a 3rd wheel with the two friends
Did anyone else notice that Julien’s nails were painted!?! 😂😂😂
You have a YouTube video of a fireplace playing when the TV is on top of the fireplace.
OMG I LAUGHED UNTIL I THREW UP! I enjoy your videos so much! I do miss the prank calling😞
YA NOT JUST FA MEN...you fa men and jenna 😂
Petition to make “um, that’s it” Jenna’s official outro
Please do Eve Frsr brows. They'd look perfect on you ♥️
The fact you have a fireplace playing on your TV above your fireplace when you have an actual fireplace.
OMG!! i’ve been using just for men to tint my eyebrows for SOOOOO long! it’s so nice!
"I think that looks good." Julien: ok
I love how Jenna has a TV with a fire on it even though there's a fireplace beneath it... She's so iconic
julian sounds exactly like TJ Miller, in case nobody has pointed it out yet.
I don’t know why but at 8:33 Julien looks like Chester Bennington from Linkin Park. (RIP🤘🏻)
That was. The. Singular most emphatic "boi I dont know your life" I've ever heard
Yenno I had the worst day at work and julien almost dying just made it so much more better😂😂 ilygsm
Just for men? More like just for friends.
when has Jenna ever read all the instructions😂
They're just friends goals!
They remind me of my husband and I 😆 
¡que desm4dr3333!
0:08 
“I’m feeling generally unmotivated”
Don’t you mean JENNArally unmotivated
Jenna this stuff has given people really really bad reactions after a few uses.. like blisters and whatnot.
Google before using it too often.
Will you and Juilen please do asmr/ soap cutting. That would be soo funny!
Pro tip "I didn't read all the instructions" ....  :D
"A journey into mediocrity" will be the title of my autobiography
Julien an Aries: sees gloves
......
I'm literally watching this video to hang out and forget about my life for a while 😅 I feel attacked
10:30 That Moment You Realize You Might Have F#cked Up and Your Eye Brows & Face Might Be Black & Poo Colour for The Rest of the Month
I love how you have a fireplace scene playing on the tv behind you directly over your real fireplace. That's a whole mood, also love yall !
Jenna is, like, a really great gal, but, like, I wish she would, like, stop saying f***ing 'like'!!
two friends, chillin in a living room, five feet apart because they’re just friends
Oh my gosh. This made me laugh so hard after a crazy difficult shift at the hospital. Thank you.
and for the record, you both look awesome.
You’re my favorite couple in the world.
When you let yo little sis customize your character 😂
"Sometimes I know that you guys don't even care what I'm doing in a video, like you just wanna hang out and forget your life for a while ."

Bless you queen, that's exactly what I come here for and have been for 9 years 😭❤
Okay but why does Julien look like Pittsburgh Dad 💀
Why dont u just get them micro-bladed????
In ur next video you should recreate the intro to movies back in the 2000's . The intro where the lion roars. I hope you know what I'm talking about lol
Please do a video trying different eyebrow tints from amazonn❤❤
"Are you okay physically.. but also in like general?" Hahahahaha omg
Tiny very normal sound THE DOGS:barrrlkkkkk barkkkk
Don't die wtf. You guys will live and pass together. You got a long time to go 🙏💕✌💜
Can you please make a video of you getting your eyebrows micro bladed?? I think it would be really fun and make it easier in day to day life
100% down for the dr Phil idea
Your hair has been looking a bit too healthy.... which means it’s time for another Jenna’s ratchet hair salon
when jenna slams the table and says welcome, marbles and kermit get scared😂
Tip: Use rubbing alcohol to get dye off your skin
Y’all made me snort in this on. Keep doin you
Your squeak toy intro has also dyed 😭
julien getting triggered at jenna calling him “friend” is the BIGGEST mood
Love watching your videos before bed I get a good laugh every time😂😂 ps have you ever thought of getting your eyebrows micro-bladed? If you wanted to get fuller eyebrows they look natural:)
Hey Jenna !!
I’m an esthetician. I don’t know if anyone else mentioned this or not, but cigarette ash will take off the dye from your skin 😉
Castor oil will help them grow back faster and if you let them be for a while then you can shape them the way you want
the way she said "oh" in the beginning is so adorable!!
why do you have a video of a fireplace above your fireplace
my girl in Calgary Alberta @brows_by_ciara can solve all your brow woes!! she s amazing.
A lot of dudes shade em in. I’ve seen it!
TALENTED AND LOVELY
At 2:36 when she says you just wanna hang out and forget about your life for a while

I felt that in my heart
Love how they put a fire video on their tv...above their normal fire place
Jenna: has real fireplace in background
also jenna: has fireplace video playing on tv
Jenna- “Relaxing time with just for men”
Me- k cool

Julian when you gonna propose????
Jenna: today is not the day for reading 
Me: literally everyday
We kept telling them to propose but now they're friendzoning each other 🤦🏻‍♀️
Set that exact fire place YouTube video for my uni Christmas meal
Julien: I love how quiet my chair is.
Julien’s chair: disturbing ass rubber noise
This is my favorite FRIENDship in the world (:
You two are crazy. I love it!
I appreciate that fireplace above the fireplace
Ok but I really wanna see her getmicrobladed
In Soviet Russia car drives you
2:32

I am literally here with my feet up, sipping my third coffee of the morning while the kids are asleep 💕

Thank you Jenna 😘
You can eat whatever you want it just depends on if you want to die of poison
Something I explain to my man child husband regularly
"So leave it on for 3 hours?"

"Yeah, probably"
That IS the main reason I watch Jenna, to hang out and forget about life for a minute. You da best
Oh, my gosh, I love you guys.  Parts of the video I just keep watching over and over again, lol, don't say friend...it’s a trigger for me.  ROFL, friend.  😂
I just like that they're FRIENDS!
Jenna: "Wearing gloves? Why would I wear gloves"
Julien: "We have gloves"
Jenna: "I don't need gloves"
Julien: "I'll get 'em"
Best friend goals
Is that a Yule log playing in the background?
6:27 

*james Charles
Jenna! 
I saw a commercial about Just for Men being sued lol You better run girl! ❤😆
So. Does anyone else enjoy the fireplace over the fireplace? Lmao

Edit Also, did anyone notice Juliens beautiful black painted nails??? ( 12:00) Love it! Get you a man that’s also your best “friend” (pun intended)😂
the (gasp) "it looks like you put mud on my face !!" was so excited, oh my gosh
Jenna, since when did you get two fireplaces?

A fireplace over a fireplace
JENNA. You don't have to apologize in every video because you think some hater is going to hate. DO YOU GIRL. DOOOO YOUUUUUU. Lots of love, homie. xxxx
:)
Don't forget to water your Cermit.
Stop plucking.. geezus they’re already gone!!
has fireplace
Puts a video of a fireplace on the tv above the fireplace
Loving that fireplace channel 🤩🤩
Just gonna say... I do use Just for Men on my brows... all the time. 😂
I was laughing so hard during this whole video 😂😂💀💀
dude why don't you microblade?
It's not for Men and Jenna .
It's for Jenna and Men.
EXCUSE ME MA'AM WHERE IS YOUR INTRO
Julien looks like Jack Met From AJR in this video 👀👀👀👀
If the emt’s saw you without eyebrows, they would probably think, “Oh my god, it knocked off her eyebrows.”
It’s gets me every time 😂😂😂 When she says JUST for MEN
"Sometimes I know that you guys don't even care what I'm doing in the video. Like, you just wanna hang out & forget about your life for a while, so"

I felt that.
PLEASE COLLAB WITH BRANDI TV OKAY THANKS FOR COMING TO MY TED TALK
I always watch Jenna during my lunch at work and I need to stop because I can't contain myself. Crying laughing tears because I hold it in 😂 LOL
Love u guys💖✌
Дженна, привет) Джулиан просил тебя напомнить ему, чтобы он снял видео о том, как чуть не умер. Я люблю тебя💓💕💕💕💕✨✨✨
What the title of this video should’ve been: A Relaxing Time With Just For Men, Wamen, And My Best Friend Julien
"You don't care what I do, you just wanna hang out and forget about your own life for a moment".... I just wanted to hang out and I'm feeling so attacked right now... (#KermitBigMood)
11:08

..oh no
the best part of this video is the fire on the tv directly over the fireplace
2:59 
Newcomer: what happened to ur brows?!
"You just wanna hang out and forget about your life for a while." Yeah. Yeah I do. You understand me better than anyone.

I'm glad yall agree
Jenna... MICROBLADING COULD BE YOUR BFF!!!!
I like how this video is 15 minutes exactly
First video 😂 hilarious! But seriously? U ever considered microblading/vlog?
Hi Jena! I am your Russian subscriber. You're the best! I constantly watch your videos. I want to say that you are not too upset because of the haters, because you are beautiful, your smile and your laugh! When you uploaded a video about comments from haters, I almost burst into tears. (I'm also a little Kermit, just want to cry)
Its crazy how Jenna even on her “bad days” still makes better quality content than everybody else on youtube, never change Jenna never <3
all i  can think is;






you was at the club,  bottoms up.
Semi permanent tattoo is AMAZING. You get perfect eyebrows which look super natural and last for about 1 year. Just make sure you get a really good professional because if they are not good then it lasts for a year :-)
2:35 explained ME on a spiritual level
I thought that was Maisie Williams in the thumbnail for a second.
more like "just for friends" amiright
Love the "fireplace" over your fireplace your soooo fancy 😆😂😍
@5:55 Peach gave Kermit a kiss😂
i love that she has a fireplace and then a video of a fireplace in her tv right above it
You are hilarious! 😂
But girl I had some bad eyebrows and I grew them for a year! I didn’t wax or anything for 6 months then I would tweeze in the middle so I didn’t get a unibrow lmao! But you should let them be. Also you should buy the eyebrow growing serum off amazon and test that! I want to try it but if you try it and it works then I would definitely purchase.
Love you girl and Julian
Julian getting real life hurt when jenna friendzoned him 😂😂😂
You remind me of my cousin you make me laugh when I'm sad(be proud)
HAVE I BEEN IMAGINING YOUR INTRO THIS WHOLE TIME
even though you have angry bird eyebrows we still love you <3
Can I just say I love that these two are like a real couple and not a YouTube "relationship" that is made just for a video.
is no one gonna say anything about Julians fresh manicure
“I love how quiet my chair is”
you should follow james' video of your makeup and try replicate it biiiiiiiiiish
julien lowkey reminds me of ethan from h3h3
They are hilarious together 😆 amazing chemistry
Y’all are friendship goals omg
9:50 Me when I finish highschool and have no life plan
Micro blade your eyebrows!!!! Problem solved 👍🏻
Pro tip: hand sanitizer takes hair color off the skin
can we just appreciate for a moment how amazing jenna is now and always 😤😤🤣💞
I want the uncut ten minute video of James Charles’ eyebrow conundrum!
You should get your eyebrows microbladed 😁👍
Just for Jen(nna)
Господи, как непривычно слышать настоящий голос   .___.
Julien having a crush on his best friend for 5 minutes
Just for men:
Feminists: H M M
9:37 I'm literally weezing 😂
Fuck I love them both so much and together that's the best hhaha
THATS WHAT SHE SAID. 
9:21
“I’ll just shave em off” I want to be that strong

The way Marbles jump at 0:07  :D
her background music is like the music at fresh market
Watches this while in lockdown
Nice
Jenna - "friendly competition starts now"
Julien - "sToP sAyInG fRiEnD"
I'm literally gonna dye my eyebrows w/ Just For Men in a few days and I'm re- watching this video for reference ;)
I'm not gay, but I am a white man... & I'm COMING OUT BLACK.
I like your natural eyebrow shape, it reminds me of that Japanese dot eyebrows thing
“Ya just wanna hang out and forget about your life for a while” truer words have never been spoken, I always watch your vids when I really just need to forget about life for a bit
Hello yes I am here to hang out and forget about my life for a while
I guess it really is JUST FOR MEN
Serious question: does she use a teleprompter? Like she kept looking to the left
you should get your eyebrows microbladed!!
9:36 best part^^
Julien legitimately getting hurt by jenna calling him friend
Please do a video of doing your makeup with James’s pallet
Julian is my dad's look a like..  I swear... Brother?!?!?
I am definitely team blond hair dark eyebrows!
Jenna, thank you for your videos so much! It's so kind and sweet! You can do my day much better if it's not good! :) lts like you are my friend. I'm sorry for my bad English, I'm from Russia. I love you :)
this video shouldve been called "A Relaxing Time With Just for Menna"
09:38

When you Aries yourself into an early grave
I use just for men all the time and Jenna sweetie 😂😂
Wait! Did Mom and Dad just break up?!
Literally clicked this to hear her say, 'just for men'
JENNA FORGETING SHES A VIRGO FOR 15 MINUTES STRAIGHT
Omg when Julian got triggered about being called a friend I about died that was funny
You should dye your hair with just for men (and Jenna)
THIS is the video where the "friendship" started!!! It's never going away
Jenna try Microblading! It’s honestly cheaper and better in Asia. You won’t worry about your brows for like 2 years and get another one afterwards! ❤️❤️
jenna justifying her life choices for 15 minutes
I would  like to say that I just for men Ed my eyebrows and they look good
7:05 When you can't afford Photoshop so edit your features in Microsoft Paint instead.
you should do a video where you apply makeup but stand far away from the mirror and then we'll just see how it looks
don't worry jenna! We all like ur brows!
“I don’t have the kind of face to pull that off.”

my life in a nutshell.
Why does Julien look like he works for the Comedy club version of the Soviet Union?? 😂😂
jenna:the dogs are going stir crazy becuase it is pouring outside. (dogs inside and are calm not CRAZY but calmmmm) lol i liked that part
You should remove your brows with laser and then tattoo new ones on that won’t confuse everyone 😂👌🏼
"Ya just wanna hang out and forget about ya life for a while" I felt that
just for men and wamen
@fire on the tv above the fireplace
Has a fire place puts one on tv instead
Jenna’s comments section is the best

Change my mind
WILL YOU EVER GET A NEW DOG???
We STAN a man that will rock a painted nail. Toxic masculinity WHO ?!??
Julian looks like Ted bundy in this clip 7:26
2:39 I do just wanna hang out and forget about my life a little. You have captured my essence very well Jenna
This is like my 4th time watching this and I’m just realizing juliens nails
I love the 2 fireplaces going at the same time even though one is, well, fake.
are they watching a fireplace above their real fireplace? lmao
2?
    0 ?
         1?
              9?
I crieeeeeeeed ajajajajjajajjajja. The instant look of failure ♡
Okay I’ve watched this video COUNTLESS times and I die laughing everytime Julien “almost died” 😂😂😂😂
You can buy beard filler for guys!! My friends husband used it for their wedding to fill in his beard bald spots and it legit looked good!!
"Can you eat it?"
"You can eat anything you want, Julien, it's just a matter if you'd like to die from poison or not"
"Sooo, yes?"
She's so right I would literally watch her do anything, like her being happy and doing goofy things is the best content ever
you guys kill me. thank you 😂
I dye my eyebrows when I dye my hair, I use the left over color in the bottle for my eyebrows.  Works great!
living together and is basically our parents


"are you friend zoning me?"
JENNA!!!! YOU NEED TO THROW IT BACK AND DO WHAT A GIRLS LIPS MEAN!!!!
Actually Sunlight dish soap is a hair dye remover. I used it all the time when I dyed my hair black.
Also, your nails look really nice
If you got your eyebrow ring pulled out .
When Jenna says "me time" I'm pretty sure she means mental breakdown time
an EMT: “are you okay physically but like also just in general?” 
Jenna, with black just for men stained eyebrows: “yeah it’s called Me Time, my guy”
i love how your tv above the actual fireplace is playing a video of a fireplace
can you make marbles a little cowboy hat
Omg i cant even! I laughed this whole video. 😂😂😂 get them microbladed!!! Saved my life! Haha.
IT WOULD BE SO COOL TO SEE JENNA AND JULIEN FOLLOW AN 80’S AEROBIC MUSIC VIDEO
OH JENNA, YOU DON’T HAVE TO DYE JULIEN’S BEARD, JUST DIP
IT IN GLITTER INSTEAD!!
thx for letting me hang out and fo-get bout ma life a little
I always start watching these videos with no expectations and then half way through I’m laughing so hard!!!!!
They seem like a lovely couple ❤️❤️
I can’t get over this stupid video😭 I have watched it 10000 times already🙄🤗🤣🌈
I don’t know why you don’t just try micro blading!!!
That ring?! 👀👀👀💍💍💍
Jenna I love watching your videos they make me smile even when I am down thanks do much for being you!!!💛
“Stop saying friend!!!” Awhhh
13:21 jennifer is that a hickey under your choker
Use vaseline or castor oil on your brows Jenna. They'll grow back faster
He looks like Radar from Mash!
are julians nails painted? what a legend
Jenna’s vids give me anxiety and help me de-stress at the same time.
"They can't go outside and get their sillies out" ~ icon
i love how they have a virtual fireplace above a real fireplace
did anyone notice the tv playing a fireplace?
Дженна ты супер
2:32 You could do literally anything and I’d still show up like what are we doing today beech? Dying your arm hair? Cool. Contacting your dogs ancestors with a ouija board? Dope. Staring silently at a wall for 15 minutes straight? Sure girl, do your thing. I’m here for it all.
Haha you guys are too much 💙 thought this video was so funny. My girlfriend wants me to do a video with her on "just for men" style on brows. Oohhh man...kinda scared haha.
I swear Julian is a real life Nick from new girl. 😂
I thought the fireplace was unusually high
Say something nice or say nothing at all, i immediately thought PRAISE PRAISE YOU YOU!!
Julien has black nail polish on and I’m living for it
fire head)))))
“When u let you lil sis customize yo character”
You should Kermets hair purple, or a different color
Julian glove asmr
Dye your hair bright green and go on a green screen adventure
Casual time at the beech
You lowkey look like post malone in the thumbnail
I love how julien is just sitting there wearing a pub g hat
You should get your brows microbladed!!
Why does Julien look like a park ranger that follows u around the hiking park to tell u fun facts on bears 😂🤠
Tbh I would probably watch you brush your teeth and be entertained, I’m v much on that I just want to hang out and forget aesthetic
I’m glad julien can identify and communicate that he’s getting triggered ☺️😂 it’s funny and healthy
MICROBLADING JENNA, MICROBLADING
that @11:09 oh no is SUCH a life mood
Wow they're sUCH good friends like I can't even
#FriendshipGoals !!!
Julien with nails painted and the pubg hat, and getting triggered by Jenna calling him friend is like the best thing ever. 😆
I love you guys, y'all are hilarious. Also, does Julien have a manicure in this video?
Julien almost dying has me crying. I’m deceased
Jenna go to Sally’s and get yourself some disposable spoolies for your brow tinting and use Vaseline around the edges like you would if you dye your hair so you can control the shape 😉☺️🥰
'you just wanna hang out and forget about your life for a while' 
if this aint exactly what im doin
You should try microblading on your eyebrows!!!😊💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️❤️❤️
I know you may never see this comment but i have to say you have shaped my life and have been my hero! everytime I watch one of your videos I can not help but smile and  you have actually inspired me to do alot with my life and I hope I can meet you one day!
Even though y’all been married
If you added a moustache, you could be Groucho Marx.
"Are you taken?"
"No, I have a friend"
lmaooo they're so hilarious
You should record a microblading video!
Why dont you microblade them
I just saw an ad on TV for a lawsuit about just for men, and it made me think of Jenna
Literally has a fireplace playing on the tv above the real fireplace 😂
2:35 bottom right corner
My best friend in my head
You look like Billie Eilish in the thumbnail
julen and black nails minus one
I love how Jenna just does whatever she wants to her eyebrows because it's stuff I probably wouldn't do myself (yES I'M A COWARD) so I'm just living through her
I love you Jenna, thanks for being such a peach.
12:34 kermit??
this video was so un-virgo that it triggered me as a leo
do a “me time” siries
They should call it just for frens
It looks like you melted black crayon and put it on your face!
11:07: “I think mine’s gonna look good”
11:09 “Oh n o”
IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW SHES WEARING A RING
ON HER RING FINGER
You like rock Lee.
“Are you okay?........physically, but like also in general??”
In Greece, hairdressers smoke a couple of cigarettes and then use the ash produced to rub the dyed skin around the hair and remove the dye off it. It actually works!
“This has not been my result” 😩
i love the fireplace video right above the actual fireplace
I love that Jenna has a video of a fireplace overtop of her real fireplace😂
Just imagine. If Julien actually swallowed the plastic glove and they had to go to the hospital looking like that... 😂
I feel your struggle Jenna, i have a horizontal scare in my eyebrow so i always end up with wonky eyes ;(
I can recommend someone but they in Long Island
Mmmm... I Love this!!! xoxo
everytime juilen made the dogs bark, my dog started to bark & howl
Man I wish I had a friendship like that
Jenna you have no idea. But I really love you🌹❤️
You should get a Tattoo of marbles ! And record it !
Do it again and Clean it up with a qtip !
Try microblading!
are you taken?
  no I just have a friend. 
      I felt that...
Microblade your brows
this hairstyle looks so good on u jenna
Yep, just sitting here a big pile, checking outta my life for a bit wif yoooooo.
This is how I used to tint my eyebrows lol they're naturally blonde, I'm letting them be blonde again now
Grimes looks different
Julien getting triggered by jenna friendzoning him is everything
Sooo we learned that just for men dyes your skin
No Way Jenna, I pinch my skin on the thumb since I was little too!!!! I thought I’m the only one crazy like that🙈💅🏼🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️😁❤️
micro blade your brows!
I love that they have a fireplace playing on their tv when they have an actual fireplace right below.
Nobody: 
Jenna: puts video of fireplace over fireplace to dye eyebrows with just for men
Aries season is approaching!!!!
You should make a bra purse
he looking like Billy Ray Cyrus xD
Why is she so beautiful even when she has just for men all over her forehead 💘
Me: i feel depressed
Jenna, an intellectual: unmotivated
13:13 me in everyday life trying to make shit work
Yo hold up is there a video of a fire place above her actual fire place
I like how they have their fire place going. Then above it on the tv they have a fake fire going on their tv lmao
Looks like 2 revolvers over your eyes...lol  just for men?
"You look beautiful. . . Are you taken" (jenna) "nO i JuSt HaVe A fRiEnD!" KSKSKSKDKFKE 13:20
What long fingers you have "Jenna"
Just join the brows together and call it a day.
I GOT TOOTHPASTE IN MY EYE!
cant wait for the ‘jenna friend zoning julian for two minutes straight” compilations
I love how she has a fireplace in the tv but underneath she has an actually fireplace
story on how you two met please
Jenna: Boy I don’t know your life ! 😂😂😂 so much sass lmfao! 😂😂
😹 как всегда годный видосик~ ❤
before you wiped it off you looked like an angry bird
Make your own makeup plz
Have  you  been  to  UK and dinnington Yorkshire  cuz I think I saw you today In yesco
Did not notice julien had his nails painted
"I didn't read all of the instructions," noT VERy ViRGo oF yoU, JeNna
10:45 that's me every single day of my life when I look in the mirror
Jenna you should do a video where u get ur brows done professionally micobladed
Will you read our tarot cards next time
Use a Q tip and try to ONLY hit actual hair next time. You can do this with normal hair dye (I have many many times with permanent dye). You can also do it with henna but you have to leave it on longer (probably about as long as you did here -haha).
I’m in love with Juliens black nail polish
Before the beard, with that hat on, Julien looks EXACTLY like Radar on M.A.S.H.
Peaches eyebrows are so cute 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
9:36 DEAD 😂😂😂
these brows were better before :D
"Just for Men and Jenna!"

Nononono. Just for Menna.
jenna i love you but it makes this video makes me so anxious like YOU KNOW IT LEFT A POOP STAIN BEFORE and you keep rubbing your eyebrows so hard and i feel it takes it off from your actual brows omg 😭😭😭 i have still watched this easily 10 times.
the way that they look at each other is so cute ❤️
She looks like joe from Impractical Jokers...
The “too much” gene is kicking in
I actually really like your eyebrows does that make me a not professional, I mean I never was but does the power up stack?
He looks like he’s been working in the yard and rubbed dirt on his cheeks lmao. I wish I could see your brows filled in with a black pencil too!! Post your filled in black brows on IG!
Going against what most people/professionals say, I dye my eyebrows at the same time as my hair. I would definitely recommend using a thin angled makeup brush instead of any kind of hair applicator. Just use a cheap or old crappy one because it definitely wont work for makeup ever again lol
you should do microblading or tattoo on brows
“today is not a day for reading” is a mood
The tv is the fireplace instead of her actual fireplace.
I find it disturbing that it looks like your hair is on fire because the fire place is directly above your head in the image. LOL!!
Girrlllll go get microblading and stop worrying about your brows!!!! Lol but i seriously didnt expect to find this video so funny
Jenna: “Do I look like I just left the salon.”
Me: yes Jenna’s RACHET salon
Before you apply the dye, use petroleum jelly where you don't want stained. Then if you want to remove the stains later, use exfoliating face wash. You're welcome :0)
“Maybe if I Tint them I’ll look less dead”
I would honestly love to see you go get that brow thing done that's kinda like a tattoo ??? Idk help
I live for these videos!! Love y’all
Julien: “Wanna hear a chain reaction?”
dogs start barking
my dog gets up and starts barking at ur dogs barking 

THANKS JULIEN.
13:22 
Julien: You taken?
Jenna: No, I just have a friend
cement being nasti in the background of jenna’s me time for 15 minutes straight
i luv u heart emoji heart emoji
definately here to hang out and forget about life for a while
Honestly Julien is killing it with that nail polish tho
Dye his beard like neon yellow 🥰 yes beeeeech, it’s needed
This whole vid is mood. Why do something today when you could do it yesterday??
I've never seen u comment back to subscribers but just on the off chance that you may.....can I please ask what you use to keep your teeth so white?
She totally should have said jennaly unmotivated instead of generally unmotivated 😂
Stains entire upper lip from this
“Are you supposed to be accurate?”
“Um idk”
0:07 Jenna-erly unmotivated
Jennerally unMaurtivated
Ok so how do I get a fireplace on my smart tv? Anyone? Help a Marble fan out?
You should dye eyebrows on your dogs😂😂
“Are you taken?”
“No, I just have a friend.”
💀💀💀
jenna, your videos are always a treat and your honest vibe is my absolute favorite
When Julien almost swallowed the glove and the dogs started barking my dogs heard it and also started barking 😂😂😂
As a tip when using just for men. Grab a cloth and warm water and wipe the access off of whatever you died it on. Then to get the stains off your skin use warm to hot water with dish and scrub away. I’ve been using just for men since January 2019 when I died my hair to unnatural colors for months. I had strawberry blonde hair so my eyebrows were light. You just have to use dish soap and warm water to get the dye off the skin. Dish soap isn’t going to harm you or your skin. That’s how I’ve been doing it and I’ve been fine ever since. It’s actually a great thing to use when dying anything on skin.
15 minutes of great friend being friends
Julian just wanted to do the glove thing lol
jenna i bleached my eyebrows and dyed them back to brown using just for men thank you for this spiritual journey
Wait she took her intro out..
Has a fireplace but nooooo has a fake fire on the TV above it!!!!!!!! LMAO Way to go Janna Marbles
My mom works at a salon so I showed her this video and she told me to f*ck off after watching this😂😂 I still love u Jenna even if my mom doesn’t 😂❤️
0:00 What kind of person has video of a fireplace on the TV but has a real fireplace?
can we get the backstory on julien's AMAZING manicure
The brows reminded me of the Rian bear
and try to glue the eyelashes on each other in length
You for men and jenna😭😂
Jenna is apart of the #AntonioGarzaSquad 
(no offense)
Nobody:
Jeena: Puts video of fireplace over fireplace to dye eyebrows with just for men
I love watching Jenna Marbles when I'm drunk. I get to relax and come back to reality when I'm watching her!!
'you just want to hang out and forget about your life for a while'   too true!
My problem is that my brows grow like the hair on my head used to. (Like 50 years ago) If I don't trim them weekly, they grow out of control. Don't get me started on nose and ears!
we already know the title is misleading because it’s never a relaxing time with Jenna 😂
Been dating for 5 years 
friend zones each other
god i love Jenna and the comment section under her videos. so wholesome.
Why did my mind come up with this 
just for men box while Jenna is doing this: it’s seriously just for men..
Jenna: no. It’s just for men and Jenna.
We love a healthy friendship
Petition for Jenna to end all her videos with "...um that's it."
They need to relabel the choking hazard on packages with small parts to "3 and under and Julien"
Julien getting mad at Jenna for saying friend is goals 😍❤️❤️
You could do so much better than that guy
WHERE IS YOUR INTRO
why does she look like post Malone in the thumbnail?
Looks like Arya Stark 😂
Watched the video last week. Noticed the ring. Came back to watch this one because I need more Jenna in my life. Saw the ring. Y’all need to spill.
I did the same thing Julian did except I swallowed the glove!
USE JUST FOR MEN TO GIVE KERMIT EYEBROWS
"are you okay physically but also like in general" LMAO
OMG I JUST SAW U IN THE SMOSH MOVEIE
i lost my phone today at alton towers, so now im sad...so im watching jenna
Friend goals
It looked like u used sharpie on your eyebrows
Julien getting triggered that she friend zoned him was the best thing ever and I’m cry
“so you dyed my skin?”
Bring back old Jenna content 😭
I was just trying not to laugh and I spat all over myself, like it came from nowhere.
I’m blonde with naturally black eyebrows and I’ve always hated them. 🙇🏼‍♀️
Reminder: Julian, make an over dramatic, 20 minute long story time on how u nearly died while with ur biffle
how did his gum come back up?😂😂😂
When he put on the gloves, that kind of turned me on. It was sexy. Is that just me?
PLEASE DYE JULIEN’S BEARD A COLOUR
“BOYYY I don’t know your lyfe”
“Why—cuz we’re jus friends?”
😏
Can we appreciate that her “fireplace” makes it look like her hair is on fire
Please. Please go on etsy. Buy a robe with feather trim. And just film yourself being graceful and relaxing with your plants. Please.
Stop saying friend, you're triggering me
Julian snapping the gloves with his big meaty man hands on camera made my butthole twitch so...thanks I guess
“Men” in Bulgarian means “myself”. Sooo, just for men is literally JUST FOR MYSELF. They don’t need to change the name, because Jenna secretly knew this all along!
10:45: Jenna laughing exactlly like the Debbie machine ☺
I love how she has 0 complex
I never noticed how big Jenna’s eyes are
Please put makeup on Julien’s beard!
Just For Friends™
And clean it off with nail polish remover or some of those wipes they sell at Sally's
hahahhahaha you are the best on youtube
Omg Jenna ur before and after for microbladed brows would be the best
LOL you and Julien are too cute together
Jenna: “Welcome to ‘I’m feeling gEnerAlLy unMotIvaTed’!” 
Me right now, during mid terms: SAME.
handsanitizer takes off the stain from the skin
You should get your eyebrows microbladed
“can i pin it up”
EVERYONE !Need that extra $$$ for hair & makeup??Maybe nails??? CARS! Get paid direct deposit EVERY Friday for posting ! Turn your phone into your office! Comment "How" for more info!
a mixture of baking soda and dish soap will get dye off your skin!
Instead of “Just for men,” they should should call it “Just for friends” 😂
IM GOING TO RAGE
When Jenna said 'Hang out and forget about for your life for a min'. I think we all felt that.
❤️ love them
"umm thats it"  XD
Julien getting friend zoned by his girlfriend for 5 minutes straight 😂😂😂
I really want to see like a “this is what I do all week” video from Jenna bc we know what Wednesday looks like but what about the other six days of the week?
I know this must have been repeated probably a million times ,but ,I  too am just to lazy to read the comments however, Fav comment " let's just do that.......  On my face"😂😂😂😂😂
Jenna ❤
Oh yeah and.."it's almost Aries season" oooooohhhh yeahhhh!!!😀 Aries here!
Why don’t you get some Rodan and Fields eyelash boost and put it on your brows
God, you guys are hilarious.
when HE   almost choked on the plastic i about choked myself.
I live for the fact that she has a fake fireplace playing on her TV that is literally right above her real fireplace..
use venta black on your brows
JENNA IDGI YOU KNEW IT ALREADY LEFT A POOP STAIN AND YET YOU DID YOUR EYEBROWS DIRTY
aww friends just doing friend things!!
Jenna Marbles, Simply Nailogical and Safiya Nygaard are the Holy Trinity of whatever genre this is
We need to nominate 5-Minute Crafts and Troom Troom for Vid-Con just to see who the heck these people are 😂
Remake the denim chair using leggings and see what happens
okay but hear me out:
we call it a jean bag chair
Spend 140$ to make s pants chair or spend 20$ to buy a chair

You choose
jenna being stressed over the stupidity of everything is a mood
"Jenna and 5 minute crafts" is like " Cristine and troom troom" 
#relationshipgoals
it's not a chair, it's a JAIR
I love how Kermit is constantly having a mental breakdown in the background
"I'm like, getting dumber from doing this."
As most things on the Internet go.
Cannot WAIT for the horror edits on this one
Make a sculpture out of wax designed as Kermit
"Can we talk about the fact that this chair is gonna be sharp"
--How the Iron Throne was really made
Watching Julian destroys the chair was so frustratingly funny
Imagine someday they try to adopt a child. And social workers find videos like this. Like, does a social work degree prepare you for stapled-jean-chair levels of "incredibly weird but not technically an offense"
is that 30 pounds of polyfill in your pants or are you just happy to see me
I swear the channel is called 5 minutes crafts because what you make only lasts five minutes, not because it takes you five min to make them
It’s definitely called 5-Minute-crafts because the crafts LAST 5 minutes then fall apart.
Maybe theyre called 5 minute crafts bc that’s how long they last 😂😂
virgo Jenna: Why would you just destroy  it!?
Aries julien: I thought it was my turn, AHH STAPLE IN MY BACK
crazy dog lady angrily makes a chair out of jeans
Wtf who's just waitin' around wanting to sit in a chair made of legs, it looks like some kind of Eldritch abomination clad in denim, horrifying...
Remove every single staple and then sew it all back up
"Do you think I should I just pack this this whole thing in a box and mail it to Safiya Nygard? She would like it." 

YES!
You have 4 premade Halloween decoration pieces. #positivity
Take my ad money for this one sis
OMGGGG, she mentioned Sofiya, they should do a collab!!!
"Idk if you've ever been 8 years old before..." 🤔
im dummy thicc and the sound of my stapler keeps alerting the guards
in hindsight i would have just sewed the pants together. it might be difficult,but it would be a hell of alot more effective than stapling.
The staples holding the jeans together is like Kermit trying not to cry
Try it with leggings I think that will work a lot better
Edit; and sew the legginings and not dumb staples
You should mail it to 5-Minute crafts and request a refund for your time and money. LOL
I think my favorite thing is when the camera just pans to Kermit
You could make a video trying to fix it, like remove the staples and sew it toghether
can you paint a grand painting of you and your dogs all serious like one of those creepy family portraits you hang over a fire place?
I love how genuinely angry Jenna is lmao
Jenna:nothing takes 5 minutes 
Me:my cup noodles take 3 minutes to cook ;)
GOTTA HAVE EM APPLE BOTTOM JEANS



BOOTS WITH THE FUR
It's 5 minute crafts because the end product lasts 5 minutes, not because it takes 5 minutes to make
I'm doing a PhD at the London School of Economics about the labour YouTube content creators and I actually met someone who works for 5-minute crafts at VidCon London last weekend! She told me that there are 800 people working for them, 150 in offices and the rest casual workers. 800!!!!!!! And they upload 3000 VIDEOS A MONTH!! She actually called it a 'factory of content'. 5-minute crafts are INSANE!


Edit: Wow thanks for all the likes! I'm glad other people find this as fascinating as I did!
Imagine an entire house furnished with badly thought out, wannabe cute craft projects like this.
i laughed so hard at this i started having an asthma attack and now i need my inhaler so thank you.
This whole video is an accurate representation of what my brain cells think about while I’m taking a test.
Use hot glue instead of staples next time, and you can use those jeans as Halloween decorations (attach shoes & have them stick out of bushes or a dirt-filled wheelbarrow).

To make a fake person: use a long sleeve shirt & overalls filled with stuffing + Styrofoam ball (for the head), then attach a wig/hat + shoes. You can position the arms behind the back, covering face, etc.
Pewdiepie vs Tseries 
And
Jenna Marbles vs 5 minutes crafts
My 3 favorite parts of the video 
1.Jenna says she's mad that the chair is comfortable.
2. Julon says a staple is in his back after he destroys the chair.
3. Jenna puts part of the broken chair on the table and calls it fancy.
0:49 Jenna your look says run😂
P.S I go made this awful jeans chair
I can only imagine them trying to forget the whole thing, but waking up the next morning to see all the stuffed jeans in various compromising positions around the house like.....oh.....right.
4:21 "That's one badass stapler!" -Five, TUA
Please sew it together! Give the people the satisfaction they deserve! 😂
The outrage is REAL!!! I love that she complains LITERALLY the whole time.  The best laugh I have had in a long time!!  I have been moved to tears!!
Jenna marbles vs 5 minute diy
Simply Nailogical vs Troom troom.
#Conspiracytheorytrue😲😲
Omg omg lmaooo when Julian sits in the chair 😂😂😂 I am quite literally HOWLING 🤣🤣🤣
T.J. Max? Is that what it’s called in the USA. In the UK it’s T.K. Max!! 😂
The minute jenna sat down in that chair I knew she thought it was comfortable
This video was on a broadway belting playlist, crying rn lol
They probably intend to have people use heavy-duty staples. Which no one has unless you live in an office space. And I don't even want to imagine the horrors you would elicit by bringing this into an office space. Some kind of Night Vale, creepypasta, Slenderman-looking noodle seat.
Someone will definitely make a horror edit of this.
I wonder why it says "5min crafts"but then says "wait for 3 hours then its done" like wtf
I think it's 5 min crafts because they only last for 5 min lol
I am SEVERELY disappointed that the word "Jair" was not used once
5:41 "How are you allowed to just post make believe things onto the internet?"
Literally 95% of the "news" on the internet
How do ya think anti-vaxxers became a thing?
yeah so if you go on five minute crafts channel and sort by oldest videos first, their videos were barely a minute long and were crafts that look like they would actually take five minutes.
The blowing into the jeans butt hole really was just👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This has the energy or a soccer mom who is making her son's school play costume the night before because her son didn't tell her until she picked him up from school that day
Anyone else reminded of Simply nailogical and troom troom
Julian calling the poly-fill filled jeans "dum thicc" is the highlight of my existence.
I forgot how much fun it is watching Jenna marbles
I could not stop laughing at her having the audacity to make a craft knowing its not gonna work. Gosh I love her
15:41 "Do you think I should just pack this whole thing in a box and mail it to Safiya Nygaard?  She would like it."  Bahahahaha!
Ahh shet I think I need an inhaler I laughed more than I ever have in my life thank you so much 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Reasons Jenna and julien should adopt me 
• I love cermit 
•I can cook 
•I do Landry 
•I want a Jenna in meh life 
•I wanna peach
i forgot about this already. I blocked it out, Jenna.
I'm watching this instead studying for the AP US History Exam and I couldn't be happier with my decision
I love how passionate Jenna was angry ranting at 5-Minute Crafts
The last couple of minutes had me in stitches! I'm literally tearing up. Love you guys!
This is the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants merch that nobody asked for
I wonder if the chair would be somewhat decent if you sewed it 🤔 kind of need a powerful seeing machine though 😂
Turns out the channel was literally started by Russians.
5 minute crafts cause it only stays together for 5 minutes
50 million people can't all be wrong. I want that chair! ❤️
who else wants jenna, safiya nygaard and simply nailogical to collab?
Honestly Jenna reminds me of my English teacher (shout-out Coach Moore) but like her much much younger sister
LAURDIY CHALLENGED YOU TO SCULPT YOUR DOGS!
Plot twist: Julian runs Five Minute Crafts
Please sow these together into an actual chair even though I'm late as hell to this party.
I think that the staples were there as visual shorthand for stitching. Thrift stores would be able to provide the jeans, and the stuffing, too, even if it is in pillows.
everything they did after Julien destroyed the chair was 1000 times better lmao
Jenna has 5 minute craft, Cristine has Troom Troom
Shes like the mythbusters of Instagram craft videos. Lol. Thanks for the quality content.
get the jeans from the thrift shop next time :) cheaper and way more sustainable
You should’ve used a staple gun😂
“Don’t step on my crotches!” 🤣😂
“And I honestly had a bad time, the entire time” lol 18:50
They’re called 5 minute crafts because 5 minutes after you’re done, it’s ruined
OMFG PLEASE NOTICE THIS SHE SHOULD DO THIS WITH HER LEGGINS
A day of a Cermit:
Whimp
Get atentione from mom
Whimp mor
Sit on lap 
Mak sur mom dose thimgs goode
Repeet

(Also the chair looks like that thing from The Forest, that has many legs, four tiddies two T-Rex arms)
nasty chair for a nasty boi
it's not a chair.. it's a bunch of jeans stapled together
Wait till she finds TroomTroom
"You deserve a staple in your back!"
      -Jenna Marbles 2019
Barry Bluejeans owns this chair.
using a sewing machine would be ten thousand times easier than using staples.
Sew the chair together then do makeup to become the pants chair
Two iconic duos on youtube:
Christine and Troom Troom
Jenna and 5 Minute Crafts

Edit: Cristine* blame my autocorrect for that H
This video literally made me weep it was so funny. I was laughing so hard that I started to cry. Not like tears and laughing, like I was sob laughing. I was just sobbing. I had to rewind parts to rewatch it bc I missed it bc I was laughing so hard.
I just really want to know where you got the wine glasses 😍
Cristine: Troom Troom
Jenna: 5-Minute Crafts
sometimes I just watch this before work because it makes my life seem easier
I watched the full ad to help you get some of that $140 back.
I don’t know why but the look of the jeans kinda creep me out.
Send it as a wedding/engagement gift for Saf!!
I can't remember the last time I laughed until I cried, thank you lol
Julian is chaotic neutral and Jenna is lawful Evil
Jenna: works for hours 
Julien: destroys it
If that’s not Virgo vs Aries idk what is
Wait what? This was a lot longer ago than one month. I feel like I’ve had this video in my head for a lot longer
Why does Julian have Lavell Crawford on his screen saver?! LOL!!!
Very uncomfortable chair with extra cost & energies 🤣🤣
I feel like if 5-min crafts sewed the damn chair, it woulda been more functional. I get that stapling shit is easier, but the end product will be functional at least.
also i'm offended the poly-fil look better in jeans than i do
Honestly this is the only channel I keep going back to since like 2010. Jenna you are funny as shit. I love you so much, my best friend is a Virgo too! ❤️❤️❤️
wait... 5 MINUTES CRAFTS VS TSERIES
You would’ve been better off with chip clips
Seeing you inappropriately touching/carressing stuffed girl jeans made this all worth! #JustGayThoughts
Jenna marbles being triggered by 5-minutes crafts for 19:27 straight
5 second crafts has been exposed.
this chair looks both terrifying and comfortable and now i want one
“I know what you put there... the chair!!” That killed me
please, i’m begging you. plEASE RECREATE FAMOUS PAINTINGS WITH YA DOGS. i’ve commented this so many times. i’m cold, hungry, and tired, but i refuse to do anything but type until you feed my dreams. give the people what we want and deserve, jenna. please
When 5 min crafts have never seen a sewing machine in their life so they rather use 
●Staples
●Hot glue
●Anythig else that isint normaly used to keep together clothes and cost 10x more than a simple sewing machine or a jarn and needle
That last bit just had me uncontrollably snickering at 3 am. Love you Jenna.
no jenna they had 12 million...

SO THEY HAVE EFFECTIVELY QUADRUPLED THEIR SUBSCRIBERS WTH
"What are you watching? What the hell is that?!?" I laughed so hard at this
Safiya be like: I sat in this stapled jeans chair for 1 week
PLS MAKE A QUALITY VERSION OUT OF SPITE
Plot twist : jenna marbles is actually the owner of 5 minutes craft
My god, I cry laughed when Julien started to destroy Jenna’s hard work 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's a chair made of butts.
Nobody:


Julien: 
Obsurdist Beauty and Lifestyle has found its peak
I tried to fix my life with staples 



she was right you can't fix everything with stables
do more "5 minute" crafts!!! youre hilarious!! love you
Bringing it back to TK maks like that and asking them for your  money back
Julien groping thiccc jeans for 5 minutes straight
she shouldve busted out the hot glue gun
I find this really hard to watch because I can’t see the screen because I am crying laughing 😂
Please do the Tun foil ball challenge where you sand it down and it becomes shiny!!!
Walmart has $8 matching jeans just thought I'd throw this out there. I love your channel BTW
I need this "exposing 5 minute crafts" thing to be a series
I'm so hungover, this is exactly what I needed
I feel like she should change her name to Jean Chair Marbles
Did you not see how thick those staples were. They probably were upholstery staples.
According to wikipedia "5 minutes craft" it´s a Cyprus based company or group. FYI
I would like to see you fix this chair with thread next week 😂
apparently 5 minute crafts is from cyprus. wtf
thank you for contributing
My Library teacher subscribed to you we seen when she went on YouTube if you see this I love you your awesome:3
life problems..? get hot glue
140 dollar crafts
I had a nightmare that this jean chair abomination was chasing me around like some kind of denim squid monster
I'm crying. You are beautiful. Thank you for this! :D
She literally asked not to ruin it. What did he do? Kept ruining it. 🙄 I love your determination, Jenna
Uncomfortable groping the whole time
It’s called 5 minute crafts because by the time you’re  done you have 5 minutes of life left
I love this! 5 Minute Crafts has always annoyed me. I don't think I've ever seen something that would actually work on their channel. 
I don't know if it helps with your desire to track them down, but I know they're owned by Brightside.
This reminds me of the land lady
Kermit: cries in the background nonstop
that is the most i’ve ever laughed in my 12 years of living🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think it would be hilarious if you sent this to Saf and Tyler for their wedding!!
Now I can see why Cristine loves you so much 💖
Turn it upside down and put a blanket over it 
BOOM mini doggie fort
"Tehe"
8 year old me: Mom I attempted to staple my soul to my will to live and it didn't work. 
Me now: I farted in class....*it was loud.*
no one:

jenna:    \ | /       \ | /
               👁        👁
Best jeans chair EVER in the history of Jean chairs😊👍❤.
JENNAMABLES hi how’s never mind
Omg I love your relationship!
i am in tears from laughing omg. a GREAT vid that i am so sorry you had to make lmao!
should’ve taken baby jeans and made a jean dog chair.
“I had a bad time the entire time” caresses Jean leg
$140 things to make a jean chair that even work
Or
You could buy a $20 chair that WoRkS
Send your chair to 5 mins craft and challenges ghem to reverse engineer :)))))
Getting 50 mil subs without saying a single word.
sew all of these stuffed pants onto the back of one pair of jeans so you look like a gorgeous denim peacock.
I stapled my thumb once.
It hurt like so damn bad.
5 MINUTE CRAPS (hi from spain)
Ok but instead of staples sew the jeans . I’ll help dm me . Lmao
Kermit crying in the background is everything
Jenna is to Five Minute Crafts as SimplyNailogical is to Troom Troom
You can still use the jeans: also fill a shirt and make a head and hands (out of pantyhose) and make a Jenna Marbles and Julian doll! 😁
At 0.49 can we just talk about how terrifying she looked😂 in the nicest way
Am I the only one curious about are all the things hanging on the black rack on the wall?!?
Please go to walmart, buy tiny kids jeans and make one for Marbles! But with sewing or hemming tape rather than staples, and the base bit might stay together if you loop some string through the belt loops at the bottom and tie it. I have no dog and no Walmart so I can't lol
I want to try this myself honestly.
JENNNAAAA will you pretty please try to one up 5 min crafts by actually sewing that horrid chair??
It’s called 5 minute crafts because the craft stays together for 5 minuets
brings a stuffed pair of jeans onto a flight as a neck pillow
They're called 5 minute crafts because they come up with the ideas in only 5 minutes, that's why they don't work
It’s a jean bag chair 😏
15:35 Jenna looks like she's gonna take my beautiful voice for legs
I smell a conspiracy theory brewing about 5 minute crafts
I know they used a regular stapler but a construction stapler would have been so mch easier.
2 days later I See the chair at Ikea and it becomes the most trendy chair of the century
I love everything about this video, but also can we talk about how fabulous those lashes are?
The lesson of this video is,  if something is broken or isn’t working, JUST SLAP SOME STAPLES ON IT! 😂
" 5 Minutes Craft "
Make a video where you do five minute crafts crafts better than them!!!
Forget Human Centipede, this looks like Denim Arachnid.
This is my favourite thing you've EVER done 😂
i love how upset she’s getting. she’s like crying during half the video 😂🤧
This was one of the funniest things I have ever watched, Jenna omg. I love you. Keep doing you <3
It's so cute how she's whining and complaining all throughout the vid and still makes them anyway. 😂💕
You and Julian are so funny and cool. I adore your videos
!
hello from Ukraine
17:50 what hannibal lecter does with his leftovers
Can you do a video making this work?
This is honestly the hardest I’ve laughed in a long time. You are just my favorite 😂😂
I really think we need a part 2 where Jenna actually sews and makes it a real chair...
3:26
Illuminati music plays
I'm in TEARS laughing 😂
IF YOU SEND ME THE PIECES TO THE JEANS CHAIR, I WILL SEW THEM ALL TOGETHER AS AN AMAZING CHAIR AND SEND IT BACK AMAZING!!
The crotchmenship is amazing 😂
conspiracy theory: Jenna Marble IS 5 minute crafts
Shane Dawson needs to investigate 5 minute crafts about this conspiracy theory! 😂 
Thank you Jenna and Julien for this A+ Content. Also Saf and Tyler would TOTALLY love it. 💜
If you'd done one row of staples like in the video and not have one pair of jeans a size smaller then it would have worked
I love you Jenna, from 19.27 onwards he was dead to me 🤣🤣🤣
🤪🤣🤣🤣 i saw this video from them and thought “ THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT IS GONNA WORK “ and here comes Jenna thinking that same thing , and starts making it ! I NEVER LAUGHED SO LOUD , i had tears from laughing . This is gonna be one of my favorite videos 🤣🥰❤️😘
this is the number of staples jenna used to make the chair
👇
The end of this video was perfect I laughed so hard!!
Tag yourself 

I’m Kermit crying in the background of the video
Truly, the only queen fit to sit on the Iron Throne... er... Denim Throne.
Who else awed at 1:26 just AWWWWWWW
It’s called 5 minute crafts because they only last 5 minutes
The f’ing on queue music at the end makes laugh so hard every time
nervously sweat bc i have 5 pair of jeans (3 high waisted 1 boyfriend and 1 mom jeans...)
Cristine vs. Troom troom
Jenna vs. 5 minute crafts
9:59 
I felt so viOLATED
part 2- where you fix it and sew it and actually make it a chair lol
You are a five-minutes-crafts's BUSTER
this made me laugh so goddamn much. hilarious
JENNA, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT AMAZING SWEATER FROM
Damn Jenna is just too good for the internet. This made me laugh so much 💕
It's called 5 Minute Crafts because the craft only lasts 5 minutes after making it
you got stalked by him!
The jeans semi-circle reminds me of the cow leg circle things from Resident Evil Bioshock. It has the same, very concerning energy
That was exactly my reaction when I saw how many subscribers they have like how is that even humanly possible🤯 they are so bad :(
5:10 finally, I have found another ally in the leggings alliance!
This was 20 minutes of my life well spent. Thanks Queen.
The classical in the background jdndjdndj
what lashes are you wearing ? They look so gorgeous on you 😻😻
The end tho lol and the music kept playing omggg
Your efforts are always so pure. Maybe make some denim pillows <3
Stop calling it a jean chair, it's obviously a jair
I laughed the entire time XDDD 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this was the best video
this video is just a very long vine
That craft takes longer than 5 minutes.
It’s called 5 minute crafts because anything you make will only last a maximum of 5 minutes because it’s all held together with hot glue and staples 😂
Edit: oh shit thanks for the likes haha ✌🏼
If you had a sewing machine and the strong needles for denim it would be slightly less offal.
Yo that chair is thicc
The reason why they called it 5 minute crafts is because they thought about making the craft for 5 minutes but then made it in 2 hours.....if that makes sense lol
a lot of their videos feature repeat hacks/crafts too lmfao
Jenna’s relationship with five minute crafts is a more aggressive version of Cristine’s relationship with troom troom
I can’t believe you bought jeans at TJ Maxx for $20 a pair when you could have went to Forever 21 or H&M and gotten them for $10 less. Congratulations, Jenna. You played yourself. 😂  I love you and this video stopped my anxiety attack so thank you so much. 😭💕
Your genuine anger in the beginning is the best thing!!! I needed that laugh. "who has 4 identical pairs of jeans??" 😂 "Where are you? Russia?" Dying!!!
I'd like to see you try to do crafts with whatever you have lying around instead of buying stuff. If it makes it worse, it will only be funnier.
I think it could work if you sew it together
will you please make a fake you out of like, stuffed clothing?
I want Jenna to retry this, but with pants of her choice and other bonding materials of her choice. That would be funny 😂
I have like 25 pairs of Levi's 😂😂
“you can’t just staple denim” 

spank
This video has such an energy that made me laugh so much 😂
Cristine: Has beef with Troom Troom
Jenna: Has beef with 5 min crafts
I bet they used an industrial staple gun but pretended to use a hand held one.. great editing for that! Lol I love ya girl !!
They must have some high tech stapler to be able to do this. I wish I had a stapler that is such quality.
I love your guys relationship so much! My husband and I are the same way with each other and people always give us the weirdest looks 😂
omg Jenna I feel so much better thank you for making me laugh!
Jenna in a week: I CAMOUFLAGED MYSELF INTO THE JEANS CHAIR
their channel is called 5 minute crafts because it takes 5 minutes or less to destroy what you spent hours making
Nobody:
Kermit: cries in Spanish
Not kidding the company that makes five minute crafts is fun Russia 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I was drinking a smoothie while watching this and I spit all over phone because I was laughing so hard and let’s not talk about what my sweater looks like 😂😂
jenna simultaneously criticizing 5-minutes craft and the chair while continuing to make it is the best part of this
Nice feet @ 17:42 :O
0:40 Summary of 5-Minute Crafts: Julien: “What the... hell?”
poly-fil dummy thicc
17:10 omg I'm weezing 😂
I can’t believe you didn’t staple it to the jeans you’re wearing and walk round as a 10 legged monster - think of the horror trailers Jenna
Jenna: I'm mad cuz this is comfortable
This was hilarious I am crying
If you make a chair for marbles use hot glue it’s much easier than stapling it
any1 else see the tear in her makeup, sure it was from laffin 💕
Shane Dawson's next documentary should be hunting down the creator of 5 minute crafts.
Yeah its bc they used to do 5 min crafts but now its like 30+ mins
OMG this is fu*n funny 😆
Thank you for making this nightmare of a chair! 😂😂😂 Sometimes I watch 5 minute crafts just to read the angry comments. Who thinks of these “hacks”?!?!?
Also, what's your favorite leggings?
Jenna- "because you know I will make them!" 

Kermit in background- cries
I'm laughing so hard my stomach hurts... why lol
They now to this day have 
52,623,502 subscribers 
Wow
She’s so upset about every part of it 😂
19,506,044 SUB RIGHT HERE XD
Never underestimate a chair that is reinforced with staples
i think this is your actual greatest accomplishment
this has such a chaotic energy
Am I the only one that loves jeans and denim? I LOVE JEANS. They may be my favorite article of clothing because a good pair of jeans is so comfortable and looks amazing. Yes, I own way more than four pairs of jeans because I literally only wear jeans (except in summer, of course).
Sew baby pants together and make a mini-bed for your dogs!!
Omg I have never cried and laughed so hard to a video in my life!
3:05 Safiya Nygaard would🤣
wait $20 is cheap for jeans?? ive been wearing my $7 walmart jeans for like 4 years, y'all missin out
can you remake it with big staples? like with industrial staples?
"you wanna just pack the whole thing in a box and mail it to Saf Nygaard" 😂😂
You should try sewing the jeans
All jokes aside, my eyes are open about that damn crafts channel
Savers, Salvation Army, your middle aged aunt. Tf.
XD haha but girl wtf what for expensive jeans do you buy?! My jeans are so 5-10 € ok im living in europe but wtf
this is the most virgo state i’ve ever seen jenna in
5 minute crafts is the third most subscribed to channel on YouTube
Request...now make a sequel to this video YOUR WAY/ version. Show that other channel up!
I want her and @simplynailogical to do a ranting about troom troom and 5 minute craft video collab
Five minute craft challenge - You pick a craft and then you and julien have five minutes to do it. Whoever has the most complete craft wins
Like this so Jenna can see 👍🏻
When 5 minute crafts to lazy
Crying laughing!!! You did well Jenna! <3
Troom troom >>> 5 minutes craft 

#factstho
You could just cover up the hole with a pillow so u dont have to SIT on STAPLERS. Just sayin.
jenna being mad at a "chair" for 19 minutes.
You should of put a string through the belt loops and tie it together to pull them all together 🤣
Make one with leggings 🤷‍♀️
Should have thought to use a staple gun lol😂😂😂 more durable lol
Guess she’s “jean”na-marbles now!
It's called 5-minute crafts because everything you make only stays together for 5 minutes
I love the ending.
50 Hour Crafts 👍
Jenna: 5min crafts
Cristine: troom troom




Moto: Moto
I've never cried laughing so much, when Julien tried taking the chair away and it fell apart, I literally cant breathe, someone send help 😂
Maybe they’re called 5 minute crafts because that’s how long the thing you make lasts until it breaks
all I can think about is cristine and troom troom lol
Jenna can u make a food despencer for marbles please... I love you so much you are like the only people I watch on youtube
If Jenna would look at their picture for like 2 seconds she'd notice it doesn't have staples it's clearly sown or it could be safety pinned. That and the shape of the chair suggests it has pillows in it.
u ever watched “TroomTroom”
they be way worse
You should do your makeup not moving the brush, just your face.

Edit. I've only just found the James Charles video. Now you should definitely do your makeup not moving the brush, just your face. Especially if you try and recreate his look by yourself.
I appreciate the Nick Tahoes shirt.
Meanwhile Kermet over there crying
She should remake this but actually do it in a way that could work
alternative title: jenna being angry for 19.5 minutes straight
I appreciate Kermit’s gentle crying in the background... great ambiance

Wow so many people have seen this! I know ASMR is weird and not for everyone, but I would love you forever if you stopped by and checked out our channel we are new to YouTube ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The 2.4k dislikes are 5 minute craft’s team
you shoulda used when of those industrial 20+ page staplers
So on the con side that's one of the stupidest looking things I've ever seen.
On the pro side your face makeup looks beautiful and flawless here.
Your eye make up is so cute, like how
The biggest scandal Jenna has ever had. Roasting 5-minute crafts.
Walmart... u should've just gone to wally to get the jeans
This is the funniest stuff ever 😂🤣
It's almost Aries' season and this video is proof
Honestly sewing it would be soooooo much faster
we’re gonna need you to open a museum at some point to display these various artistic and useful creations
“I’m hot and angry.” - Me during every craft project.
i love that half the video is her complaining 😂😂
DO A VIDEO FIXING THE JEAN CHAIR AND MAKING IT WORK
11:15 is a mood omg😂
I can feel all the clips being made for horror edits. Jenna messing around with 4 detached lower bodies is absolute gold
It says 5-min, it should say 5-hours
I see your Nick Tahou's shirt Julian!!! Garbage plates FTW!
I know you tried to follow exact but you should of tidied like sewing or glue.
I have 7-8 pairs of jeans and I have 3 identical ones.
0:50 👁👄👁
Make kermit a small version of a jean chair by using children pants
Destroying the chair was so funny and looked so satisfying.
Anyone else get uncomfortable about how Jenna wears her leggings???
Turn this into a horror movie preview Silent Hill style.
Good job not maiming/killing julien
Next video “sewing my jean chair together” 😂
The internet is full of lies. This chair is one more
Yes. Hell is four polyfil-stuffed pairs of jeans.
the video starts and i see a pair of hands stapling jeans and stuffing them and i just went "oh honey no… no… don't do that"
watching any 5 minute crafts video is painful as hell.
DO ONE WITH BABY JEANS FOR MARBLE
I wonder how much of Kermit crying is cut out in each video
It’s 5 minute crafts, because...
It takes 5 minutes to think of something like that
It takes 5 minutes to make em
It lasts only 5 minutes
lmao!!!! its creeepy
but you have a real homemade iron throne from the game of thrones))))
if you want a real kicker: your hot glue crafts video was the second video to show up when i search “5 minute crafts”
That Jeans chair is Hella creepy looking especially in the night
 😂☠
the original video's chair looks like it could gain sentience at any time
I think 5 min crafts is from Germany bc they use German newspapers in some videos
Please dress in full denim and turn yourself into this chair
tbh i feel like they recycle videos. i feel like 5 minute crafts takes videos that have the least amount of views, edit them in to a random video, upload it, and barely anyone realizes it.
Lmfao.  I needed a good laugh today.
Yes I have stuffing lying around my house
Stuff some shorts and put them in the middle
Jenna should have more subscribers than 5 minute crafts
Or even fabric glue instead of staples
That's a Beetlejuice crab legs!
1:42 jennas just gonna keep talking over kermit😂
Rochester represent!
It's called 5 minute crafts because it only takes 5 minutes for it to fail and fall apart
TAG YOURSELF!





Im  fighting for Jenna's attention.
I'm a seamstress, but I don't have to be to say that using staples in place of sewing things together is a comedically bad idea. LOL.
Julien: SHE THIC
I have almost a dozen jeans and there's no way any four of them could work for this lmao
Omg please sew baby pants together for your dogs
PLEASE redo this, but sew it.
I feel like this chair woulda worked with safety pins
OMG this video. I laughed so much I cried, Thank You for that! 

Secondly, there is some engineering-like thinking going on here. Problem solving, assessing viability and gain from a suggested method,  sticking to it until your done even when you know its SHIT and DOESNT WORK (thesis ima looking at you).... You're an Engineer!
They probably find videos from forever ago and post them in they’re account
They probably used like carpenters staples 😂😂 THEY PLAYED YOU
Petition for a video with Jenna and Safiya Nygaard.
i think the only way you could staple the denim is basically using an industrial grade staplers. like the ones made to staple 30+ page papers. but they’ll never tell you that
im hoping you sewed it together to be perfectly honest
I want so badly to ziptie those jeans together so it's actually functional
U should connect it with a belt lol
This looks like something urban outfitters would sell
You should try this with leggings nobody likes jeans their overrated
For the record, your chain pisses me off just looking at it. It makes me want to burn every chair ever made and kick Ben Franklin in the nads for making rocking chairs
Lmao and I have 2 pairs of jeans. Each were about £5
maybe it was industrial staples? or like a staple gun? wow
i call this video “jenna makes a craft purely out of spite for 5 minute crafts”
I like how they both were saying 4 pairs of jeans but if you look at the picture there is only 3😂😂
Its "not for you"!! I say this to my children.
HER EYELASHES.
WHERE DID SHE GET HER EYELASHES.
I NEED TO KNOW.
😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just buy fake denim
Jenna Marbles is to 5 Minute Crafts as
Simply Nailogical is to Troom Troom. 😂
I'm DYING for her dogs tho
lol I'm in Russia and I was asked to be their actress. The worst part is that you have to come up with all those ideas yourself, but yeah, I saw the production space.. HUGE
Came for the denim themed crafts, stayed for the scissoring.
i love kermit just coming to check out what you're doing
Jenna: *has a master's degree*
Also Jenna: makes chair out of jeans
This is making me so frustrated that I want to fly from Finland, come to your house and sew that thing together and then leave
This made me laugh so unbelievably hard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*Demonitized*
The seven year itch is a real thang 😂❤️
Everyone: is sleeping

Jenna: HERES A VIDEO AT 3AM OF ME MAKING A CHAIR OUT OF BLUE JEANS
Anyone remember Sisters of the Travelling Pants?
Ok but Jenna you good girl? I see tear streaks... the chair wasn’t that bad
Expectation vs reality
please make an outfit out of hot glue
32 year old jenna reasoning with the internet is my 2019 mood
camouflage yourself into this chair
When I was a child I spent my days making crafts. I sewed little bunnies and I also used to make purses out of scrap Jean material and staples lol. If you touched them they fell apart. But basically I was a fashion guru.
Cermets crying at the beginning is me when I look at “five minute crafts” that aren’t five minutes. Or my bank account 😂
9:58 someone is gonna cut that clip and upload it somewhere we all know
Y'all underestimate the power of my JAIR
intro SENT me
Kermit crying in the background for the first 5 minutes
can we please talk about her lashes bc those are SICKENING sis
Those jeans are dummy THICC
Jenna: This craft assumes you have four identical pairs of jeans
Cartoon character:
Kermit is afeared, and rightly so
I’m in board with the Kermit chair retry video
She should've just used her old enemy, the hot glue gun 😂😂
Should’ve used toddler jeans and made a chair for baby marble boy
OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
Just 😂 but like rivers of tears down my face from laughing.
When I was 8 I stapled my index fingers together. Idk how I did it, either. But, one side of the staple was deeper into my right finger pad than my left  finger pad.
You had me laughing so hard I started coughing.
Maybe it’s called five minute crafts because the crafts only stay together for five minutes after you finish them😂😂😂
I also don't like jeans... my whole drawer is just full of leggings
3:35 "Oh, yeah, it's Russia" Well, I'm russian, and I almost sure it's true. Why? Stapels. Russian stapels. When I was a child, I actually tried to "just staple everything together" and yes, it was working XD
I was having an awful day. So I came to this video to watch you have an awful day.... I feel a little better 😂
idk why the full pairs of pants just laying around r so funny ahahahah
does a 10 part Shane Dawson series on 5 minute crafts
The pants scissoring at the end had me dying for a good hour
THANK. YOU. The girls I used to nanny would find videos like this and want to make them.  Legit spent over 20 hours on a desk organizer made out of cardboard and foam board, and it ended up looking TERRIBLE!!!  The girl had a melt down throughout the entire process asking "Why does hers look so good?" and I kept responding "Because she's a professional and we're not!"  Every time from then on out she wanted to make a craft, I warned her in the beginning, "You know it's not going to look like that when we're done."
Holy shit, her voice is normal now?? (I haven't seen any of her videos in a LONG time)
maybe you needed to use high waisted jeans? XD
I think I figured out why it's 5 minute crafts... 


BeCauSe iT oNly stAyEd toGetHEr fOr 5 MinUTeS
how the hell is youtube paying for that house is what I wanna talk about lol
Please sew i back together!!
You gotta be on just as many drugs as they were to make this work
Tin foil ball challenge!!!
Please send it to safiya so she can add to it then send it to the next person and it can be the sisterhood of the traveling pants
Please mail it to safiya 😂
Lmao this was amazing 😂
Hey im back even though knowone missed me and wishes i never came back
Can you make more videos of making outfits for your dogs? I live for those
Wow Jenna wasn’t kidding when she told us she had the “too much JEAN” 👖♍️🤣
Jenna: I'm getting hot and angry.

Aren't we all, Jenna. Aren't. We. All.
Our semi complete circle of hell 😂
Jenna you need to make a 5 min craft with Cristine in your channel, and a troom troom video in Cristine's channel!! 😂
send this idea to someone who could make one that would actually work
Jenna: complaining all the way being very very very angry 
Also Jenna: DOES IT ANYWAY 

I have never related so much girl
lovecraftian sisterhood of the travelling pants remake looks great
I started watching because of Kermit and now I just watch because
Wine art!!!🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Dear Jenna. 

I came across a GIANT fake eyelash strip on Twitter. Instantly thought of you. Really think you should turn your head into an 
eyeball. Idk seems like a fun Jenna craft. Please do with that what you will.
It really is awful oh my god
I don’t think I’ve laughed so hard in my entire life
I was able to watch the whole thing laughing
Duct tape would be more effective.
Julien actively trying to demonotize Jennas vid lol
Jenna, you should get merch of that woolen hat with "hell yeah" on the front where the "neat dude" is on the one you're wearing. I would totally buy it!
Kermit crying is so cute 😭😭💖💖
I love your crafting lol
You should become a 🌳
PLEASE make a video where you fix* the chair and actually sew it together to make it functional!!!!!
Make a chair for peach and Kermit
Bigger staple gun..... ;-)
The chair is kind of creepy!!
By about 12:00 i just wanted to see you burn them with fire.
it’s called 5 minute crafts cause the crafts last  5 minutes
This looks uncomfortable asf
I kinda wanna get some of my ratty old jeans that don't fit and make a hand shaped chair.. Like a demin giant's holding me in the palm of their hand. It would take me like 2 months to hand stitch everything together bc any machine needle would snap.
I have like 15 pairs bc they're all hand-me-downs. It's a thing in Argentina, we don't have thrift stores in most places so we just give clothes we don't want to friends and family.
I love Kermit so much
Kermit handled it all pretty well
Please buy kids pants and make the same chair for your dogs
You should do 10 hacks you really want to try
We've got really large pairs of pants over here that sell for less than a dollar for 3 pairs, so I'm guessing that video was also for me.
Haha omgsh yes!  "I have 2 pairs of jeans and I resent both of them for being uncomfortable, I wear leggings!" XD that's totally me too though!
they make stronger staplers
The angry/ranty Jenna from 2011 really came through in this video
this jean chair (jair) is Jennas banana pulled pork
Is it just me or does Kermit look like Drogon from Game of Thrones
Rewatching cause Jenna gets so mad 😂
“It might be silly and stupid, but don’t step on my crotches” 😭😭😭
when he said burn it😂😂😭😭😂
This was frustrating to watch
Them pants 👖 are really nice too ruin them all
kermit crying being covered by the background music
God damnit Jenna it’s 6 am and I came here to watch a guided meditation video to try to fall asleep and now I’m stuck watching a 32 year old lady make a jeans chair for 19 minutes. Thank you, actually. I needed this.
My favourite part is when Julien made the pants fork each other
Jenna in the beginning: I LOVE THIS 

jenna in the middle: I HATE THIIISSS ITS POINTLESS

5 mins later: we’ll it would look good In my room..
Don't even think I could do this with a good sewing machine
Holy shit the way Julien picked up the stuffed pants im dying over here why is this so funny to me
Jenna being mad at 5-min crafts for 19 minutes.🤣
Imagine you enter hell and satan makes you build a chair out of poly fill, jeans, and an office staple. And he makes you make it, take it apart and make it again for all eternity.
Next video 
Jenna staples her fingers
Why 5 minute crafts has so many subscribers. Because we all want to sabotage our relationships.
Did they maybe use a fabric stapler? Lol probably not though.
Move over 5 minute crafts
Say hello to 17 hour struggle
I um, may or may not have up to twenty pairs of jeans in my closet right now.
Shoulda got fabric glue lol
id say use zipties to join the middle together like though the beltloops
By baby jeans and make it for marble
I need Jenna and safiya to collab 😂
That chair almost broke you. Almost. But you killed it.
the nick tahou hots shirt completed this video
How to trigger Jenna 101
Hearing this with no context:


"So Julien was making modern art sculptures out of my stuffed jeans chair and my dog was trying to sit on it the entire time. And  to add on to my problems, the staples kept falling out from those dummy thicc jeans and I didn't know what to do!
I love how Jenna and Julian have 5
Minute Crafts and Christine and Ben from
Simplynailogical have Troom
Troom
Anybody know what eyelashes she’s wearing 🤔🤔
Lol love how u had to cut the vid to add $80 + $60. 🤣
I feel certain we are cut from the same cloth Jenna (and that cloth isn't denim!). ;) My exact brand of humour and general... nonsensicalness. Yes that's a word now. :) <3
Kermit is just so sad that their hacks aren't 5 minutes 😣
Jenna


PPPPLLLLLEEEEAAAAASSSE




Sew this together and keep this monstrosity in your home
Yep not for everyone
Your dog looks terrified I swear
u should put a pillow in the middle so it dosent hurt ur bum
Those jeans looking thiccccc



😂😂sorry
I am laughing so hard i can’t stop 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You should’ve bought the jeans at Walmart or a thrift store
Hey there jenna  you sound so purdie I really like watching you will you set down it makes me feel funny inside
I lost it at 18:27 when she blew into what would normally be someone’s butt 😂
exposing 5 min crafts for 19 min straight
Can't wait to see the horror remakes of this!
 Laughed a little to hard about the "scissoring jeans"
Should’ve used wire coat hangers for structure
get a fabric stapler
i was getting mad deja vu feelings at around 12:38 while eating corn on the cob, then realized it's because i've actually seen a picture/clip?? of this part while eating corn on the cob once. and also i never eat corn on the cob??? anyway what i'm getting from this experience is that this video inspires me to do things i wouldn't normally do and that i should step out of my comfort zone every now and then
You should turn yourself into Julien.
Successful folk also rivet jeans
11:40 close your eyes 😂👌
😂😂😂😂im crying hahahah😂😂😂😂
Omg im dying from laughing so much lololol
if u were here when she uploaded the video the first time then ur a real jenna stan and I appreciate all of you
I'm just waiting for 5-minute-crafts to comment
i laughed so hard this entire video oh my god
I'm only seeing three jean pairs in the original image. Just me?
Caress da booty...
why does she only has 19 milj subscribers? I'm CoNfUsiOn
one comment is all it takes~ to make her do something insane~
lol
everybody talks about pewdiepie’s war vs tseries, but what about jenna’s war vs 5 minute crafts? what a legend
Has anyone already asked about her lashes?!?!?! I neeeeeed them!
Did you know it takes 5000 gallons of water to make 1 pair of jeans 👖
Your cermit looks sad
Watching the day change in the windows is the best part
Remake it but actually sew it
u should have stapled the leg bits together at the top so u have a pant pod
Buy 10 dollar Walmart jeans they have like 500 of the same pair
Please send this "chair" to safiya niygard
Idea: slide down the stairs with it
i literally watch youtube like once any couple months, and your channel is one of the two channels i’ll watch
This is my favorite thing that exists on the internets
How mad you got at this jean chair is better than the chair
pleaaaaaaase try easy hair hacks its like five minute crafts but hair
I have not laughed this hard in a long time lol
Should have used hot glue...
Does anyone else ever get home invasion ads on her videos?
"I have 2 pairs of jeans, and I resent them for being uncomfortable. I wear leggings" 
Girl same.
Jenna all pissed off is reminding me of myself, an ARIES ♈️ Kween!
Pls sew these together
Jenna: I've never said anything like this, but F this channel.
Me: Looks at jacksfilms.
I have 3 pairs that are the same but their different colors
JENNA PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO TURNING YOURSELF INTO SOPHIA THE ROBOT
Did you consider industrial staples?
17:09 timestamping this in case I forget how to laugh
"Hey God, it's me, ya gurl Jenna" is the reverse version of "Hey there demons, it's me, ya boi" from buzzfeed unsolved lol
It looks like a baseball glove lmao
Whoever is running the channel is hella rich
They can’t even be demonetized bc no one speaks 😅
Instead of jeans it should be like yoga pants, or something cheaper than jeans
Send it to Sofia Naegard😂😂😂😂😂
When they are stuffed, that's how my legs look in skinny jeans haha
it's like a white walker symbol
Please ship this to Saf that would be hilarious
Sew it so it works! We want another video with the jean chair!!!
I say you send it to Safya Nygaard, as is in four pieces and see what she does with it. And after she's done she sends it to Cristine and we can see what she does with it. And then just keep going from Youtuber to Youtuber. Like in The Sisterhood of the traveling Pants.
I was cleaning out my closet and found eight pairs of faded black jeans... EIGHT.  Lol I guess I'm the target audience for this craft..
5-minute Crafts makes and average of 1million-80k US dollars a year
Julien making jokes about it the whole time is a mood
I love this lmaooo
But like what if you make one that actually works and isn't a safety hazard?
I love hw she’s never click bait 😂😂
I read ‘Jesus chair’
19:27 you're welcome.
I need a redo with leggings
this made me so agitated to watch hahaha
Jenna went from oils, to acrylic, to abstract painting, to sculpture. A true artist in the making.
I haven’t laughed at a video for a long time up until now
those lashes are gorgeous
its like that movie with the people sutured together ass/mouth but somehow even more disturbing
It kinda looks like a denim baseball glove chair lol
Pewdiepie vs t-series
Jenna Marbles vs 5-minute crafts 😂
13:54 If only it was $40
But if you hate the chair, or your partner gets pissed at you and burns all of your clothing, you can easily just take out the staples. It's like a zombie survival skill. Stuffed with actual zombie parts.
Julien truly thinking he is being helpful by throwing Jenna the stapler (clearly, the easiest item to find) right after  she went on a five minute rant about how difficult it was to find ALL THE OTHER SUPPLIES....is just such an AN ARIES MOVE and I relate so much. 


By the way, IT’S AIRIES SEASON, YA’LL. Hide ya sharp objects. We accidentally cutting everything ‘round here.
I watch five minute crafts like I watch slime videos. Ik i could never make it but i love watching them
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOURS IT TOOK ME TO MAKE THESE SHOES AND HAT, ON THIS CHANNEL THAT HAS THE AUDACITY TO CALL THEMSELVES 5-MINUTE CRAFT
It’s called 5 minute crafts because your sanity only lasts 5 minutes before u snap while you’re making it
At least after the chair inevitably breaks you can take off the staples and wear/ get rid of the jeans
I would kill Julien for destroying it xd
I think Jenna should make it her way with less poly and a fabric stapler or sewing machine. It could be a cool, unique piece for company etc 😂✌
surprised 5 minute crafts didn't tell us to just hot glue them together
It's like an octopus
5 minute crafts is Jenna’s version of Cristine’s  Troom Troom
Yes they are from Russia, Kazan. And they are looking for actors and actresses, helping to relocate to Kazan. It’s your chance!
Girl I now☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
This is the content that my soul needed
Can you make it really nice and sew it
The ones in the end video on their (5-minute Crafts) channel is 100% sewn with a heavy duty sewing machine. You need a needle for leather if you want to sew denim. As an avid crafter I abhore their channel and all the reposts I see absolutely everywhere and people ask me to make because they cant figure it out that its a clickbait video.
Do a five minute craft but try to actually get it done in 5 minutes
I request a sequel where you actually sew the chair together
They should have used construction grade staples and stapler, and it probably would have worked.
Imma join the trend. Buy baby jeans and make marbles a chair so he can sit
She said 140 i will never get back but that youtube money tho
11:25-11:35 my mom talking about me
I have one pair of jeans and the rest of my pants are leggings too! ha
Shoulda sewin it, much safer
her genuine rage when julien ruined the chair was so immense I Felt That
i really cant stand julien most times but when he said i thought it was my turn i died
HOW IS HER EYELIASHES LOOK LIKE THAT
J A I R
Denim octopus 🐙
I don’t think you guys understand, 5 minute crafts is called 5 minute crafts because it takes 5 minutes to destroy a craft you made in 24 hours.
It looks like a sea creature 😂
In a month they get 3 million subscribers
2:45 TJ MAX?????
Bruh if you made this but with 5 pairs and you left the middle pair empty you could wear it and deceive your enemies into thinking its 5 people. You woukd have to make a similar object but with shirts and 4 dummy heads but whatever
shane should do a conspiracy series on 5-minute crafts and troom troom
damn this chair is scary af actually
So do you like the chair or not??
Julien really Aries-ed up that chair.
everyone's gangster until the pants start unraveling
Can’t wait for the horror edits 😂😂
S E W  I T
Is Julien still suscribed to 5mincrafts?
Staple them to yourself so you look like a spider
Oh so you say tkmaxx
Oui oui
Julien looked like an octopus on this “chair”
get stoned and watch this video, it will be even funnier
Anyone else miss her intro
The part where you can legitimately hear Kermits crying in the back and Jenna is just talking over it made me spit out my milk
I'm all about these Jenna vs. 5 minute crafts vids
lashes lookin like f**king spiders 🕷🕷🕷🕷 👌👌
0:40 i died there at that "what the hell!?!?"
I literally pay at least $5 on quality jeans at goodwill. Last week I bought a $3 pair of fcking awesome jeans at the Salvation Army. Be smart people
jenna marbles dragging 5 minute crafts for 19 minutes
Omg, don't you shop at Salvation army, Goodwill,  or yard sales? You gotta do better😊 you could get all that for like $20.
13:17 he had the perfect opportunity to say 'jenna is losing her marbles'
REMAKE IT BUT SEW IT INSTEAD??
@5minutecrafts
“it’s so infuriating, it makes me so angry and that’s why it belongs in my house”
“Kermit we know it’s a lie”

Kermit: cries
Whyyyyyyy dirty minded are you 😂😂😂😂
and now I want a garbage plate and I live too faar away right now to get one
Is it odd that my ex has an identical scar, on the exact same spot on his nose, as my girl Jenna here? Lol. 🤔
"I don't know if you've ever been 8 years old before..." 😂
It's called 5 minute crafts customize that's how long they last
you should be using the kind of stapler that is meant for harder things the staple bullets are much thicker and harder. more sturdy. :)
Buy baby jeans and make a chair for marbles
5 minute crarft it the new pewdepie
I really appreciate that Jenna still finds $140 to be too much money. That’s not even sarcasm. Becoming upperclass and maintaining middle class stinginess— that’s something to be proud of 🙇🏻‍♀️👸🏻
oh no...
Ugh, those eyelashes make me feel like I have something in my eyes. Gahhh
I have 5 drores of jeans most identical I live in jeans!
I have like 100 pairs of jeans more than 10
This is what you should have gave James Charles as a house warming gift
As a person with a fear of staplers this video was a struggle
It's fun to see her so pissed off lol
I think they used jeggings lol
I know they wouldn’t match. But I’d go to goodwill or the thrift store to get the jeans. And if matching is that important get light colored denim and dye it.
It looks like a lab experiment in which they cut off people's legs and tried to fuse them
I literally never heard of 5 min crafts before watching this video but now that I looked them up once, YouTube thinks I wanna see them all the time and I cant help how intrigued I am by these pointless and unrealistic "life hack" montage videos! You were right. This channel is ridiculous.
Ahhh i have the same birthday as Jenna🥳🥳
christine and jenna should make a video where they both get mad at troom troom and five minute crafts bc this is exactly what i need
Y’all missed your chance by not editing in Jenna’s face when she blended herself into a chair when you were showing all those chairs. Opportunity wasted.
Lol when he took the sticker Jenna went full on MOM mode
Jenna: "Marbles touch anything!"
Marbles: touches cat tree
Jenna: "sorry we're not getting that."
Marbles: deeply depressed
Jenna: “What 👏🏽 if 👏🏽 one 👏🏽 of 👏🏽 you 👏🏽 touches a 👏🏽 cat?”

Julien: “Ok I’m gonna cut.”
Kermit: takes all the toys
Peach: takes all the treats
Marble: 👁👅👁
Jenna: literally refuses to buy Kermit one thing

Kermit: pees on floor take that
So NastyBoi picked out a giant sausage, a metal chain, and a butt syringe.. well looks like someone's got a big weekend planned
im crying at kermit running away with the sausage
It would be really cute when Bunny get more comfortable and they do this with her auajajsnsj
Peach: excited
Kermit: nasty boy
Marble: 👁️👄👁️
Shirt: “straight chillin”
Kermit: internally screaming
Nobody:
Kermit: 'Cause I may be a nasty boy but I'm perfectly good at it,
Paint and bees can break my bones
But chains and irish spring excite me
Cermet buys butt syringe, chain and big sausage...

FIFTY SHADES DARKER
Cermit: pees on floor and buys entire store
Peachy: Buys a normal amount of items
Marbles: 👁👅👁
anyone here after jenna got bunny🐰
marble looks so much happier after getting his teeth out
Marbles is technically a senior dog who has the energy of a 4 or 5 year old growling at the cats and keeping up with everyone. What a cutie ❤️ Kermit is hilarious
Nobody :

Marbles : growls intensely at everything
jeffree star should do this with his 7 pomeranians
Kermit: N A S T Y B O Y

Peach: take all food

Marbles: 👁👅👁
Nasty boi got a big sausage, a butt syringe, and chain wear. I think theres something he's trying to tell us.
I wanna be reborn as a dog Jenna eventually ends up adopting
I like that small little Marbles has a ginormous bed near the fire place like a king
Cermet:cries
Pasesh:eats
Marbles:👀
               👅
Jenna:JuUuLiIiIEeEeNeN
Hotel:Trivago
I feel bad for Marbles, his brother sister are going on a shopping spree while he’s over there deciding what to pick 😂
bird: looks @ marbles
marbles: 👁👁
                  👄
Kermit: touches chain 
Julian: is that what you’re into? 
JULIEHAHN DOHNT KINK SHAMEH KERBERT
IF THEY HAD THE CAT TOWER,THEN THEY WOULDN'T JUMP UP ON THE TABLE.

...poor marbles, he just wanted the one special thing...such heartbreaking disappointment :(
Maybe once Bunny is more comfortable, she could wear the Drinking Buddy shirt!
Kermit: I want this, and this, and this, and THAT.
Pees 
Kermit:Take that for forgetting about me!
kermit just shopping for himself is such a mood. All those years of being nasty has finally been worth it.
When Bunny is ready they need to redo this video.
She won’t be ready for awhile but god I can’t wait to see them do this with Bunny
They predicted big Bunny's arrival... And got giant food (Probably not but I like to think that way)
I need a version with bunny once she’s ready 🥺
22 minutes of Kermit being a nasty pricey boi
Jenna: “I’m not gonna hold it for you so you can gently put your mouth around it” 
Me: lol that’s what he said 😂😭💀
I would swear that Cermet knows he is shopping.

Also those are bull penises.
buys greyhound-sized dress


puts it on kermit
He protec
He attac
But most importantly 
He bork at cat
You need to make a video where you all dress the same and do a family photo shoot
I have watched this video more times than I can count. Every video of you hanging out with your dogs is my favourite. Thank you for sharing ❤️
w h e n  t h e  s a u s a g e  h i t s
They picked out the big treats for Bunny. Doggy premonition.
I promise the “butt syringe” is not that 😂 it’s a pill gun for pets who don’t take medication inside treats well. It gets the pill past their tongue, to their throat, so they aren’t able to spit it back out and have to swallow it
kermit pees in the store

Jenna:👁🕳👁
Kermit: Bratty child that just wants everything
Peach: the one that follows after the other
Marble: the older child that doesn't want anything
5:27 Jenna picking up the dresses that she accidentally knocked over and placing them in the correct location 😍 a queen.
Simba, everything the dog touches is yours
Peachie and Kermit knew they were getting a giant little sister soon so they prepared.
Marbles look sooooo much happier ever since he got all his teeth out !
American petstores: Cats, chinchillas, ect.

Netherland (my country) petstore: just birds and hamsters..
So huge stretch but all the toys they picked out were more big dog toys, maybe the doggos could sense their new sis Bunny was coming😂
Jenna at the beginning: cerrmit doesn’t touch stuff none of them touch stuff!

At the pet store

Cermmit and peach go insane touching every thing
Jenna: peach hasn’t picked anything

Peach: I tried to get a sticker I like stickers
7 rings but its Kermit in the pet store
you could put the drinking buddy shirt on bunny when she's more comfortable around all of you guys !
wow. marbles has a v long tongue for such a smol puppy.
I love how Kermit picks something to put up his butt, a fat sausage, and a choker.😂😂😂
Jenna, I'm watching this te day after someone who meant the world to me died. Thank you so very much for distracting high-energy content. I dont even know what to do right now, but this is helping me not loop the thought. Keep it up! You're doing great! ❤
Kermit: “I want it, I got it”
They should do this with Bunny (at least when she’s ready)
they picked the perfect bigger toys and shirt for lil Bunny 🐰❤️
“what if one of you touches a cat?”
whispering “cut. cut.”
I just watched two bratty children and a senile old man wander aimlessly around a store for 20 minutes...jesus
For a second I was like "where's bunny" then I realised something
Now bunny can wear the drinking buddy shirt
Kermit, Kermit, Kermit KeRmIt KERMITTTTT NOOOO 
you a bad boi😂😂
I hope they do this again with bunny in the future once she has acclimated
Kermit being the biggest known nasty brat for 22 minutes
Paesh protec
Paesh attac
But most importantly GIVE THE SNAC BAC
THE CLIP OF MARBLES JUST BARKING ONCE IN THE CAR HAS ME DEAD 😂
i’m watching this high and this is the funniest video i’ve ever seen 😭😭
“Peachie, you picked this one out!”

Kermit zooms in for the kill 😂
They see it
They like it
They touch it
They got it
This is just the dogs foreshadowing Bunny's arrival
Marbles: lick

Dude: he’s buffering 

Dude: your got high ping?
cermit: toys
peach:food
marble: CaT tOwEr
I love how marbles has a ginormous bed for her size
MR. MARBLES DESERVES THE CAT OF HIS DREAMSSSS!!! PETITION FOR NEXT WEEK GOING TO THE SHELTER AND LETTING A CAT PICK YOU
'Cause everytime we touch, i get this feeling~ 🎶🎶
Conspiracy theory : they picked giant bones bc they knew bunny was coming and wanted to make a nice impression on their new friend.
Now you have a big dog to give all this stuff to!
Cermet : pees in floor
Paesh : jumps off cat tower
Marpel : 👁👄👁
Can't wait for Kermit's episode on hoarders.
"You forget my leash, humiliate me in public.." 







Pees all over harness. 



Adventures in the life of a nasty boi.
i lost my shit when kermit peed on the floor
Lol kermits butt syringe 😂 Its actually a pill popper for cats 😊 Loved this video! Part 2? Lol
toys = SNATCHED 
snatcher = kermit lol :P
Kermit kept picking out dental chews to flex on Marbles
You should put the big “drinking buddy” shirt on Bunny when she gets more comfortable
“What a dysfunctional squad”
Why the heck does marble have a bed 20 times bigger than him????
I love how the dogs all have nick names mrs.weach Bobby and nasty boy
Kermit being a hoarder for 22 minutes straight
I literally watch this video daily. Why is this my favorite? Lol
Don't get too upset with Cermet.  I've done that when I've gone shopping and just can't handle the excitement of buying too much stuff I don't need.
I really wish that there was a personal views counter so I could show how many times I’ve watched this video only
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“He’s like drivebying” 
I can’t 😂
Marbles just wants a cat. He wanted a cat tree and a cat to go in it
“The dis functional squad.”

I’M WHEEZING
Jenna: "none of them touch stuff"
Kermit: Touches everything
Poor marble he deserves the world just pick out anything marble you deserve it
they got the hamster ball for ad btw RIP MARBLES 😦😢
Kermit:
I see it😍
I sniff it 😏
I touch it🙂
I got it😎

*Thank you Kokono 😂
I’d love to see you do this with Bunny when she is in a better place and could enjoy it without being scared 🤗💕
I think this would be so fun to try with Bunny once she's had the chance to adjust a bit more and build her confidence
0:52 

"Sorry, we got a plant on the way here, because I have a problem."
I work at petsmart and your dogs picked out a lot of good stuff 😄 I love your dog videos! ❤❤❤
I aspire to be this financially stable
Once Bunny is ready, I really hope they get a cat.
Absolutely no one: 
Kermit: buys choke chain, butt plug, giant sausage, and a dress.

I don't wanna live! Forever!
Is it hard to take care of a Italian greyhound? I have wanted one for a while but I heard they have health problems so I was wondering what it was like for you?
In some videos peachy is a lady

but in others sHES A PIG
Kermit peeing in the middle of the store is the peak nasty boy energy.
Kermit looks like Buster's "anxiety face" from Arrested Development
Kermit is literally like a toddler when it comes to clothes. If I'm in them then I will do nothing as a silent protest
Jenna’s dogs are literally walking memes😂😂
Bunny could eventually wear the drinking buddy shirt!
Picks up pill shooter
"It's like a butt medicine thing"
If you kept the big treats, you now have Bunny to give them to.
You have no idea how many times I’ve rewatched this
Cermet is my spirit animal
Peach is my best friend
And Marbles is my older brother I never had
this whole video is just kermit being spoiled and N A S T Y
I know that they didn’t have bunny here but I bet all those big treats went to her and she’s so happy 😁😁
Jenna: said that this challenge is boring 
Everyone/mostly: yea its BoRiNG

Jenna: still makes it funny
Jenna:What do you want?

Dog:Yes
You should donate the things you can't use for your dogs! Shelter pets would enjoy all of those things. 😁
Nasty Boy has more than soap fetish, I think.
It’s 6:01 AM where I live and my laughter almost woke my parents up 😂😂😂
Breaks my heart seeing poor animals in cages like those cats like if u agree ➡️
This is 100% the funniest video on this entire godforsaken platform. I cried. I CRIED. 😅😅
a lot of stuff is happening



Marbles: 👁👄👁
Kermit: * picks giant sausage *
Jenna : NO KERMITTTT
Hours later
Jenna: * hands him sausage *
Kermit: * runs with sausage *
Julien: he likes big sausage😉🤨
Jenna: 
Well now  bunny can wear the drinking buddy shirt
Do not let your Cearmet pee on the floor in pet smart. It will not help them grow.
You should do a Eating Dog Treats with my dogs part 2!! Except now with everything they picked out😁
You should do your makeup not moving the brush, just your face.
To be honest, I don’t have much love for cats but it was so sad how they were locked up :((( the cage was so small 😔
"I got my hair stuck in it"
Jenna

"To stick it up your butt? / Kermit like a big sausage" 
Jullian
I want that Jeep Grand Cherokee trail hawk so bad! It’s so amazing!
Kermit was BORN to collect greenies. Its in his blood. Rats, chiken, and greenies.
"Is he buffering?" 🤣 Really need a just Marbles video
I'm in love with your channel!!! From Ocala,Florida
Kermit ran them pockets
I died when kermit started walking like a person 😂😂
Mr. Marbles looked very much alive and happy in this video and it made my heart happy
Peach? Food driven
Kermit? Crybaby
Marble? Dead
Bunny? Scared of screens.
"Sorry, we got a plant on the way here. Cause I got a problem." Big mood
Do this again but with bunny😭❤
Bully sticks, or springs, are bull genitals
Cermet being a brat for 22 minutes
Omg I’m actually crying, like I’m not using hyperbole, there is actual precipitation coming from my eye holes!
Well I guess it's good that you got a bunch of big dog treats now that you got a big dog
OMG take them to a clothing store and buy yourself anything they touch 😂😂
I think Kermit came out of the closet 🌈
Marbles: disassociates
Kermit: plots their murder
Peach: exists
You should do a video like this w bunny, spoil her
How to keep kermit still 101: give him a shirt
kermit wanted toys
peach wanted food
marbles wanted a cat tower
I always get the bigger chewie treats for my little guy, it makes them last longer and they spend so much time and energy on them, makes them worth while!

EDIT: those twist treats my little guy LOVES those! He chews on his for days!!!
"He's not picking anything" I'll have you know, Marble clearly wants a cat friend...that is CLEARLY what is going on...he wanted a cat tower, he barked at cats...he wants Le kitty pal
"I don't think he sat,i think he passed out" IM DEAD😂😂
little did they know kermit got all those big treats for bunny he knew the future all along. the legend
Honestly Didn’t Think Laughing During This Video But I some how managed to
I want to kiss all of your dogo's and hug them
Marbles is just happy to be invited out. If that ain’t me...
4:05
kErMiT gOt SpOoKeD
Kermit: YOU UNDERESTIMATED MY POWER FOWL HUMAN
"You deserve anything you want!"
Julien- " no you don't "
Kermit: touches everything I told you everything would be mine
Can we PLEASE have a Marbles day? Just, Marble doing everything he loves and being happy
I was thinking about how they have snacks that were too big for the Iggys.... but now they have Bunny 😭😭
Marina: Hermit The Frog
Jenna: Cermet The Dog
Clickbait you didn’t buy the store
Mubble is such a precious little nugget 😭
Gets a big chain, alcohol shirts and a butt syringe.
Spends all of Jenna's yearly savings.
Pees in the store.
Steals Peaches and Marbles toys, and loves the big sausage

Kermit's nasty boi levels have never been so high.
Marbles faces:
👁👄👁
👁🖕👁
🌑👄🌑
👀👄👀
✖️👄✖️
2:12
I can't tell if that is the pure face of happiness or if Marbles is actually tired from all of that walking and stuff but either way I heccin love it.
am i the only one just waiting and looking forward to the next video with Bunny bc i wanna see what's up
Lmfao give the collar that Kermit picked out to Looks like something billie Ellish would wear on you😂
“My dogs don’t touch anything”
kermit proceeds to drive by touch everything
I think u should get a baby
Yall are a amazing family 😂I'm subbing
All the stuff that’s too big for them will probably go for Bunny. 😂
Dogs:
Jenna: STOP BEHAVING
Kermit just got to tired from jumping and he had to let it out LOL
Kermit: I can’t eat while wearing my favorite shirt! I might rip it when I eat!
I want that camo-marbled 1/2 zip!!!!!!! 👏
1like one prayer for my dog 🙏🏻
marbles is SO cute in this video. i feel like he’s showing off his Big personality more since he got his teeth out. no pain/discomfort = no problems = confidence !!
Marbel makes me think of my dog that passed away
He picked out the chains to become an Eboy
Bro I just realized you have more subscribers than Jake Paul lmao
He touched the earth YOU MUST BUY THE EARTHHHH 🌏
“He’s not picking anything.” What are you talking about? Marble is picking all the fights.
I think Marbles is the selfless one among the siblings. :D
Well they got enough treats for Bunny now!!!
3:27 
julen: damn Kermit! Is that what u r into?!
Me: kinda kiNkY
I hope yall know that me and my girlfriend both strive to be like you guys when we get married 


Accept in a lesbain and much angrier version
Hire a pet psychic to find out why Kermit cries so much.
13:59 Don't ask what he's doing he's straight chilling
whatever?! bro i love this video XD
Damn girl! You totally had an opening to get a cat! They picked out the cat tree for you and everything- what do you think they were trying to tell you woman! 🤣😹😂🤣😂😹🤣 lol love your content good luck with the quest for a cat😹
You should take Kermit to a soap store
Kermit : " I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it "
I never subscribed so fast to a channel in my life, you guys are hilarious and I love the dogs.
Wish I had this luxury! I just always wanna spoil my dog all the time
when kermit peed-NASTY BOI
i have a italian greyhound and he acts like a cat. 






illuminati confirmed:

italian greyhounds ARE cats!
Jenna: "You deserve it. You deserve anything you want."
Julien: "No you dont Kermit"
I love your squad♥️🐶🐶🐶
Side note: that Petsmart plays some good ass music
my favourite part of this is the 1 second clip of marbles random bark in the car
so is nobody gonna mention how Kermit pissed everywhere
Can Bunny wear the drinking buddy shirt? xD
Maybe donate the excess stuff they would never actually want/use to a shelter! (please thumb us so they see this)
'Dysfunctional squad' 😂😂😂
watching the video with automatic subtitles,
" you only want things that are giant pieces of boob"
if jenna kept the drinking buddy shirt, it would fit bunny. ❤️
how to go bankrupt.
Marbles touched the cat and the cat tower. He wants a cat
Jenna: Kermit stop peeing 
Kermit:👁👅👁
Marbles lost his marbles
Can you get marble tested for epilepsy because that looked like a myoclonic  epileptic seizure
I honestly wish I could get that Price Tag 😂 1:55
half of this video was marbles realizing he’s alive & then malfunctioning.
Marble just glitched for like 30 seconds straight
Well if you had gotten the cat tower… Then peach would’ve had a place to sit
Logic..
Kermit and Peach were just like"*you PEASANTS get us EVERYTHING, we want ALL THE FOOD.*" 




Marbles was like "sowwy I no understawnd, I just want cat tree"
Dog Touches Rolex
Jenna : Shi.....
Please donate the extra treats and toys you don’t want to dog shelters!! I work at a dog shelter and we are always in need of treats and new toys

Edit: thank you so much for all the likes! I’ve never had this many and it just goes to show that more people than I ever thought would care about dogs in shelters.
Jacksfilms’ dogs can’t relate 😂🤪
Kermit,Peach and Marbles already buy Supermarket 😂😂😂😂🍬
plant live stream
plz i need this
Tou shouldve buyed the store pol
Marble got robbed. He deserves that cat tree.
jenna: marbles does that look like you?
marbles: how is I supposed to know what I look like
This is clickbait. You didn’t buy the floor
Is Cermit a greyhound?
11:20-11:30 totally gave me vibes from The Office ahaha
Nobody:
Kermit: Pees on the ground
Kermit: my younger sister
Peach: my older sister
Marbles: me
somebody please make a meme of 18:25
when kermit peed i couldn’t stop laughing😭😭
Why have I just discovered these videos? They are amazing.
This whole video was just Kermit getting revenge for you guys forgetting his birthday
Q: Describe cermet in a video that is less than two minutes 
A: 10:50-12:30
This video had me crying from laughing so hard. Thank you so much for this amazing video.
Your dogs are absolutely precious ❤️
18:28 marbles.exe has stopped working
Mr Marbles is anti-consumerism mood 2019. Watch out, Marie Kondo.
I feel like after Kermit peed in the store, you should’ve told Kermit that everything he picks from now on is Marbles😂
16:30. That stick is more alive then marbles
I wish you did this after you got Bunny 


Hh
Kermit is into BDSM
We can't pretend we didn't see this coming
DYSFUNCTIONAL SQUAD
Foreshadowing?  Buying all these big toys and big bones....the kids wanted a "big" sister.
My dog has that same drinking buddy shirt!
I died when Kermit peed
Marbles secretly was picking out stuff for a cat freind. The tower, the toy, and the actual cat.
Dog : touches floor 

Jenna : buys the store
I seriously cried so hard from laughing while watching this video, kermit with the giant sausage did me in haha thank you for the amazing content, Jenna. Love you!
50 Shades Of Cermet
Kermit: Mama, me want to go pee pee 😰


Pees on floor
I WANT TO SEE bunny wearing the "drinking buddy" shirt
GURL, WHAT LASHES R U WEARING, THEY ARE STUNNINNGGGGG
Kermit should do asmr 😂
I really be rooting hard for marbles
Marbles "buffering" literally made my day. I'm cry laughing lol
Maybe Bunny can wear the Drinking Buddy shirt now 😂
If my mom were like that * daydreaming *
"Kermit likes a big sausage"
LMAO
You can always donate anything to shelters
JULIANS COMMENTARY 


"IS HE BUFFERING"

I CANT BREATHE DBSHJDFHSDFS
2:37 foreshadow to Bunny's first shirt!!!!!!!! ❤ 😍
Kermit is actually the most amazing living being to ever exist. I’m done. XD
"what a dysfunctional squad." -julian 2k19 
me watching the camera tilt towards all three dogs walking in different directions and poo jenna following along
Lol Kermit is such a character <3
wait why does Kermit look buff af in that shirt? damn.
This is such a simple video but it manages to be the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
Nastyboi at 10:58 has me crying almost as much as Nastyboi
I was literally dying at 6:58 when Kermit peed on the floor
10:02 I love how they are so confused😂😂😂😅
I just realized...marbles growling sounds like Perry from Phineas and Ferb...
Take me shopping for anything I want next.
I freaking love that Marble is the smallest but yet he has a “Great Dane” sized bed right in front of the fireplace!😂
OMG I hope they do this again with Bunny some day when she is ready! Spoil that pretty girl rotten!
18:35 I think marble is broken 😂
Jenna looks SNATCHED in this vid, not just a snacc, a full meal ;))))))
I kind of think that Marbles, Peach, and Kermit realized how to play this game of a video. Idk why, but they seem to be either EXTREMELY curious, or purposefully choosing certain items.
I was laughing so hard 😂 this vid made my day😂😂😂😂😂😂👌👌👌❤️
3:06 That's the Aries energy she's talking about. Lol I would have said the same thing.
I wonder if they kept the Drinking Buddy shirt, it’ll probably fit Bunny!
They see it, they like it, they want it, they got it
Jenna:I'm gonna let marble walk alone
Also Jenna:*holds marble*
You are such a great pet parent. I  really hope you get a cat soon❤️
omg what if Kermy was buying for marble n maybe even peach
Omg now u have bunny to give those big treats too!
Jenna: marble sit
Marble: dances nervously
I'm going to save up and spoil my dogs like this ❤️
Them lashes tho 👌
18:25 marbles proceeds to buffer over too much excitement and and things to render


He cute tho
Can you do this with bunny please??
as someone who works in a pet store thank you SO MUCH FOR CLEANING UP KERMIES MESS!  You would not believe how many times people just let there dogs pee wherever and don't say anything. It's at least once a week, like I don't care if your dog pees I'll even clean it up its fine. Also the syringe thingy is for shooting pills down a dogs throat, like if they don't eat pills. And the big liver treats they picked out are really healthy! You can put them in water and they'll get mushy so marbles can eat them too!
The only thing marble actually touched is a cat tower and I think that's a hint he wants a cat
“Omg she is a pig”
I don’t think pigs can jump on a 10 ft counter from the floor
Kermit faces zero consequences for peeing in the store and being a brat, nastyboi
Thoroughly enjoyed watching Kermit Not pick out things for himself! 😂
Sexy dress? Big "sausage"? Choke collar? But plug? Conclusion, Kermits a freak
6:53 Kermit oh my g×d 😂my face is so red from laughter atm😭😂
I liked this video just cause she had to stop to get a plant. Ahh that made my day
We need an updated version with just Bunny
I love Marbles’ happy evolution from 
💢👁👄👁 to 👁👅👁🎵
You like my toys? Gee thanks just bought! 
I see it 
I touch it
I bite
I got it
Every time "nasty boi" is mentioned I laugh
no one:

literally no one at all:

kermit: 
It gets funnier every time I watch. I'm crying
marbles buffering for 3 minutes straight
When they said we gotta take home lex I got excited cuz my nickname is lex😂😂
You should do spray paint art
Marbles was so funny when you asked him to sit and his tongue appeared to rebel against him 😂😂 Your dogs are adorable!
Okay but like I love that sweatshirt where did you get it 🌸
marble only wanted the ONE THING and you didnt buy it, rip in pieces cat tree
Marble:👁👄👁
Julian:he's buffering
now all the big dog treats and toys will be enjoyed by Bunny <3
You are awesome jenna... an awesome doggo parent :) good luck to you in everything you do :)
These dogs are such horrible gremlins and o love them
Marble got robbed. He deserves that cat tree.
I love when Peach takes the bully spring! She’s such a lady
Please do this then donate the treats/food to an animal shelter <3
How much cleaning up was done after this lol
Cat looks down dog goes grrrr
He peed in the store to Mark his territory........ Now you need to buy the whole store lolol
18:31 BUFFERING AND HIGH PING
the huge stick treats are actually a veggie dental treat 😊
Once Bunny gets more adjusted, it'd be cool if they did this with just her.
The three N’s that describe cermet 

Nasty

Naughty 

Nuisance
this is the most alive ive ever seen marble
Apparently everything belongs to Nasty Boi
Kermit - takes peach’s pink thingy
Peach - takes Kermit’s blue thingy
Jenna - ?
Peach - Kermit and I agreed we would switch
The original video of this was for rescue dogs, one was special needs and small. I love her, Freddy is the best.
Kermit (pees) I told you I had to go before we left
Kermit: Being a nasty boy for 22 minutes and questioning his sexuality 
Peach: looking for every piece of food with chicken.
Marble: 👁👄👁
“Peach you can’t have the sticker because mommy said no stickers” lol what a dad
Y’know, a lot of this stuff is helpful now that Bunny is here!
6:52 I have no words but thank you for getting that on camera
I love that soft "otter" Julien says after Kermit pees. XD
They should do this again, but then make Kermit donate everything to a dog rescue.
I love Kermit but I’m so glad I don’t own him 😂😂
I couldn’t stop laughing omg I cant believe I watched it all😂
YOU HAVE TO TAKE BUNNY TO DO THIS NEXT!!
Okay but the shirt that Kermit picked thats too big for him is the perfect size for Bunny
Kermit: N A S T Y
Peach: Food driven
Marble: Living his best life not knowing where he is.
Cermit being a nasty boy for 23 minutes.
What kind of necromancy did you use on Marbles? He's alive!
6:56 I’m DYING🤣🤣
Clickbait they didn't buy the floor
Kermit is having THE BEST day of his nasty little life
Weird flex, but okay
The monkey that Marbles first picked out is the same one I have xD
Congrats, your first item was a bag of twisted bull penises
Now this is what happens when you over-water your cermit.
Marble looks like he made a deal with Satan so he could get eternal life, but he forgot to ask for eternal youth too, so now he lives forever aging normally
10:58 Kermit running just killed me 😂😂😂
luckely u got a big dog now to eat all that stuff
I love it but like his filming is really really making me nauseous
Im actually kinda sad, bc. Marble.
“Buying my dogs everything they touch.”

Kerm- “excuse me??????????”
Cermets so funny and peach  also marble is my favorite
Why is marble toothless I’m new
Jenna: ill buy you anything you touch
Dogs: touch the whe store
Peach picked up the colour I think.
let 👏 Jenna 👏 get 👏 a 👏 cat 👏 2k19 👏👏👏
Marbles : 👁👄👁
juilen am getting motion sick watching this video
This is the most I’ve seen Jenna A L I V E
We are moving
I am supposed to be packing
Instead I am watching this!!!!!
You can donate everything you dont need to the local animal shelter.
Aww they ended up using the big tub of treats for Bunny
I would bankrupt the next 5 generations of my family if I did this before exercising my dog
We love that you love Redbarn! Can we share this video to our audiences?
Hey Jenna! I’m sure your local animal shelter would love to take whatever the nasty bois don’t end up wanting
I AM MARPEL
👁👄👁
17:23
Jenna: you act like we dont feed you
Kermit: snurf
Julian: audible disgust

Marbles: 
I actually did this with my dog years ago. We use to take her to this one pet store to get her nails cut and I’d let her pick out stuff for being a good girl. She would always pick out toys. I should of done a darn video. 
Missed opportunities🤷🏼‍♀️
I’ve watched this 82 times 🙃
Jenna: go on marbles! Pick something!
Marbles: 👁👄👁
I love marble so much❤️
Yo am I Bella Thorne or was the title really hard to read -__-
You could donate all the extra stuff to a local dog shelter!!!
10:57 <— putting this here for me
Marbles kinda touched the cat...he wanted the cat...clearly.  I think you should get him the cat.
I literally almost peed my pants when Kermit peed on the floor 😂😂😂
Lmao I know this is old but I work at Petco and
the Sticks that Kermit didn't want to eat when he had the shirt on are Whimzees they are just Vegetables
The "Syringe" is not for but medicine it's just a way to give your dog pills if they don't want to eat them on their own
Kermit and Uno (Shane Dawson's dog) both picked the "drinking buddies" hoodie 😂😂😂
Marbles wanted that cat house :(
"Hey Peachy you picked this one out."

Kermit aggressively grabs the arm and runs off
I LOST IT WHEN KERMIT STARTED TO PEE
You can put the blue drinking buddy top on bunny when she is settled in your house more xx ly Jenna julien Marble peach Kermit and bunny 🐾
They are so freaking happy!
It’s a good thing they have larger treats now that they have a larger new baby Bunny! ☺️
“FeRGEts LeASh sHaLL URINATE”
We need one of these with Bunny
Cement bay for his mom a 🐱
marble being bullied for 22:23 minutes straight
What is Kermit planning? What does he need a drink king buddy shirt, neck chain, giant sausage and a butt syringe for? #extremelysecretive
Alternate title: one (1) nasty boye spends all my money and hoards all the toys
cermit is pure gold
The fact those cats are in such tiny spaces id seriously heartbreaking. It’s banned in the uk thankfully
Kermit loves his dental treats 😂
Kermit is living his best life
Maybe you can donate all the things you don‘t need to an animal shelter? So it wouldn‘t be so wastefull
Jenna: what if 👏one of them touch’s 👏a cat!
Julien Quietly Says: Oh No

Lol
NASTY BOI AND LAZY BOI THE PERFECT DUO
Where did you get peaches collar???
you finally have a dog that can fit in the shirt kermit picked out!!!
Good ol' Marbles wanting that cat tower reminds me of Stanley from The Office dreaming of owning a decommissioned lighthouse.

edit: thx 4 the likes the office stans
8:39 is the face of true regret and terror
The nametag😂😂
Kermit chose the  butt thing AND a sausage.
8))))) gayyyyy
Jenna: touch something marbles 
👁👄👁 * marbles touches cat tree * 
Jenna: 👁👄👁
marbles touched lex the cat and the cat tower. i think that was his way of letting you know that he wants a cat friend 😂
MY puppy touchs everything
She should make a 2.0 with bunny
I wanna know what lashes she's wearing-
I'm proud of Kermit for living his out hoarding gay goblin life.
JUST SAYING, in one of your old videos you said you'd get a cat when you owned a house....
So..
Pay up beech.
Next week's video. JnJ adopt a kitten.
The man kept me entertained lol
Marble is the cutest, derpiest dog I've ever seen. 😂😂😍
The only Jenna marbles videos I watch are dog related
XD marble is so cute
Marble was taught to look with his eyes and not his nose 🤗 what a polite bebe
Oh my god he peed on his paw
My 80 lb greyhound did that in petsmart too.
Kermit is what I think I would do when I get a new sugar daddy, mables is what I actually would do 😂
The “butt medicine” thing is actually a pill popper. For the pets that don’t take pills well
this is the most i’ve seen marbles alive omfg he looks like a different dog i love him
😤





Cermet
21:03 doggo spinner!
Do a part 2
17:49 my dog would swallow that treat whole🤣(btw I have a pitbull)
New title: Kermit being a middle child for 22 minutes straight
The butt medicine thing is actually for giving them pills lol
Bro it’s a pillar not to go up there butt😂😂😂
When Marble was slowly walking around, deciding what to pick, then finally chose the cat tree "We aren't getting a cat tree" THE DEPRESSION IN HIS  EYES  D'X
Kermit being a nasty boi for 22 minutes straight
can u be my mom?
Why is that grey creature always whimping?
10:00 the dogs cracked me up idk why 😂
I will let you walk me through the mall on a leash with no knee pads if you’ll buy my everything I touch....... but like... you have to buy EVERYTHING I touch.
Marbles looks very much alive in this video.
I want to see the receipt for these purchases lol
This is the most alive I’ve seen marbles in a looooooong while
Dogs: Touches oxygen
Jenna: Can we buy this oxygen?
Oh she touched that name tag 
gets it
nonono stop
Clothing turns Kermit into a law abiding upstanding member of society
You missed your chance Jenna.....if you get a cat tower then you NEED a cat to go with it
What if....
*Marble*: touches a child
*Jenna*: ._.
Everyone:


Kermit: 👁👃👁
              💧👅💧
there is only one (1) braincell between all three of those dogs and it's always marble's turn
But does marble fit in the giant hamster ball?
That chew they liked was Whimzees Veggie Sausage. It helps their breath smell like tomato sauce and great for dental health.
Well now you know the Iggy's can eat a marble.
18:33 Marble is tasting it from there before you give it to him, he can’t taste cause he’s not really alive but he’s got his own way where he “buffers” to taste food. Tru fact.
Kermit looked like he was in the verge of tears when you said Kermit what the hell was that?
Marble wanted a cat.. A bird.. And a chinchilla.. You guys just didn't get the clues.. Haha
Images some one say miss marbles and dies of laughter
13:44 im dead 😂😂😂
Can we just talk about how good she is at makeup? Can you please do my makeup Jenna! ❤️
Love watching this video when I’m upset. Just makes me smile
If you got a bunch of stuff you don’t think they will use or can’t return, you could donate it to a shelter or something!
The 70 bags of dog food the dogs touched should donate as well. That wouldn't be waseful
Are u gonna buy the earth
Just so you know, that is an oral pill shooter. We use one for our Greyhound and it helps get the pills deep enough in his mouth where he can't spit them out.
For me this wouldn't be as bad… my dogs usually only grab 1 item :'D and they stick with it :'D
"He's the only one picking stuff out, and he's peeing in the store"
gives the big treats to bunny :’)
You didn’t get the chinchilla tho 😂😂
no one:
jenna's nails in that one video: 16:06
The large sausage Peash picked is perfect for bunny
THANK YOU FOR CLEANING UP AFTER YOUR DOG.
You should put the drinking tea shirt on kermet after the dentist lol
who is here after they got a greyhound? (bunny)
I started laughing so hard when kerment peed
Love 8:40 when Jenna immediately regrets this video after seeing all the shit in the cart 😂
Marble is a sim. 





He wanders aimlessly and glitches
wait... did marble eat off The Carpet and not The Ground @7:30
6:53 I DIED AHHA omg i was so sad and this made my day
Marble is adorable I love her
5:34 i want alll of them c:
I say next video you grind some of the treats and give marbles a purée treat buffet
Their doggies are the cutest! I bet Marble's was testing to see how true to her word Jenna was so he ONLY touched the cat tower lol and when they were looking at everything they bought and Jenna said "I think Kermit picked that out" but in reality Kermit picked out everything that was bought haha and it made me happy that Jenna actually cleaned up his pee and didn't go get someone else to or just leave it because unfortunately there are people who let their dog go inside stores and just walk away

Also irrelevant but that glass the kitties were in was so damn clean I honestly didn't think there was any glass for a second there
kermit: i see it, i like it, i want it i got it

peach: thank u, next

marbles: ummmmm... no
I don’t think Kermit is able to move with the green shirt onXD😂😂😂😂😂😂
bruh marble got that ea servers ping
'He's a brat' says Julien in his Bratz doll voice
Was hoping they would buy the other stuff and donate it....
“What’s happening to him...What’s happening to him...is he buffering?” 18:30
you didint buy the floor
The choke collar is called a prong collar if people wanna know 😂
“But he doesn’t touch stuff” 
5 mins later
Kermit proceeds to touch half the store
Wgen he took up the sticker 😂😂
Kermit while picking the Drinking Buddy shirt: 🎼I drink a Summer Shanty to get the party going!🎼
At 5:03 marbles looks like me when I got drunk for the first time btw I never got drunk
so i havent finished the video yet. but i really hope everything they bought that they arent going to use went to an animal shelter.
I'm proud of Kermit for picking a leisure suit for himself.
I love how they put him in the harness cuz they forgot the leash instead of just buying a leash in the store and using that 😂
2:11 why is marbles' face so funny there
Peach touched that chinchilla's cage and they didn't buy it! For shame!
Kermit was the ultimate nasty boi in this video






Edit: wow 300 likes, thanks😁😁
Kermit is so cute if I spelled it wrong sry I'm new to this
DO A 2 VID PLEASE!!!
i feel bad for those cats in that tiny confined space :(
My chihuahua wont sit on tiles unless theres food involved, but he will sit on carpet.
Literally anything: exists

Kermit: is mine
I noticed you were wondering if the treats were healthy or not, to be honest 90% of the stuff they picked out is natural and healthy, the greenies are the only thing that would have a lot of ingredients! :) Love the things they picked out!
Kermit is literally me in almost in every manner
7:02 we need clean up on isle 2
Wow. I never thought I'd see the day that Jenna gets finessed by her pets.
Julien: OoOoO fresh breath, Kermit why don’t you touch that 
Jenna : 😅

I died omfg
Kermit is a twink: confirmed
Snoop dog!!
I feel so bad for marble :( awww
Kermit really cares about his one tooth
jenna: "marbles sit" 
Mr Marbles: tries to bark
Mr Marbles: falls down from effort 
jenna: "good boy"
what if the dogs touch a Lamborghini Gallardo?
21:03 me at 3 am having a mental breakdown🙃
16:07 mE aS a MoM!?!!
The syringe is for giving cats pills (orally)
I feel like Marbles needs to shop at the Versace doggy store and not Petsmart for plebeians
Kermit peeing on the floor had me laughing for ten minutes straight.
Omg they keep cats like that, thats so sad
I can’t flipping spell to day
I rate this video a Big Sausage / 10
Marbles funky little walk when he wanted the treats OH MY GOD MY HEART 😩😩😩
Why does every body hate on poor marbles so much he's old and sweet
just wondering what happened to ad?
6:52 cement got to excited over greenies
Get this woman a cat already
Marble seeing those cats is the most alive he has looked since 2012
I have been leaving these on repeat for my dog as he sincerely watches them. He is a half iggy and cries when hears Kermit cries. 😁
Marbles touched the giant chicken bone wth he did touch stuff
Also raw hides are bad for dogs. Something in them messes with their insides.
they are cat condos who calls them cat towers 😂
kermit leisurely shopping for himself while the others watch in despair
Awe if you guys bought everything they touched you could have donated the stuff they didn’t need.
Our petco has a donate station and we donate every once in a while when we can
Marbles is adorable
You gotta buy the air and the floor
Title:buying my dog everything they touch no dog food lol
The butt medicine thing is actually for pills! You use it to shoot the pills into the back of their mouth to lower the risk of biting.
19:09 did Julian say butt plug??😂
dogs are greedy moms spaghetti
5:50 Kermit used elongate
I cackled when julien got the sticker
Julien: "Marbles, you still haven't touched anything."

Marbles: "I can't friggin REACH anything!"
I did this once, yeah I left my dog at home for that one
Marbles cant pick anything because he's dead
Marble is just so happy to be alive
Before I saw this video myself my dad told me about it. Kinda laughed to myself that he watched a Jenna Marbles video but he found it really funny
Get marble his God damn  cat tower
Every once amd a while (im new sorry) the camera guy sounds like shane Dawson
16:07 wait those are bull penis’s.😂
Pees on the floor😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I lost my shiz at 1:51 😂
Poor Marble, he could've gotten the cat tower if Julie let mom get a cat... they DID pick out a cat too. We need to stage an intervention.
I would say try the pink one on peach but she’s a little to barrel shapped
Do this with bunny when she is less timid
18:26 Marble.exe has stopped working, please try again later.
My god Kermit is such a brat😂
recREATE RENAISSANCE AND CLASSICAL PAINTINGS WITH UR DOGS. I NEED IT AND I KEEP COMMENTING AND I WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE POEPLE RECEIE WHAT THEY DESERVE
Marble deserves all the love in the world
r/stoppedworking
Sense Kermit peed dont get him any more things hese a bad boy
Plot twist: 7 Rings was actually written by Kermit
I have watched this video so many times it’s not normal
The way Kermit is acting in this video, I wonder how he’s acting with Bunny.
You should do this with bunny.
Marble touched the cat! Why didnt you buy it
I like how the cats are like 
" You can't touch me through my impenetrable wall you fool " 😂
Your dog is 10/10 a troll
You can donate the stuff that won't use
my dog used to do the same thing marble was doing at 18:30 and they turned out to be seizures. just something to keep an eye on if it keeps happening xx
let bunny do this
Marble is like the responsible child and Kermit is like, "I want this, I want that, I want ALL of it". 😂😂😂
It's hard to believe Peach and Kermit are the same breed. Peach is so much bigger and tougher than Kermit
I would love for you to do a doggy voiceover like you used to do. The voices for the dogs is always great.
Oh no...
Now buy real dogs
Marble is a cat now, buy him a cat tower!!
Now they gotta do this but with Bunny
Julian's disappointed "why would you do that?"
U should do more pet videos
I lost it when he peeled that sticker off.
Kermit being selfish for 22 minutes
touching mu dogs everything they bbuy
MARBLES TONGUE IS SO FRICKING HILARIOUS
11:19 oh shiit what is that
look at his back what is that
They bought all those big toys to prepare for bunny!
Marble CLEARLY wanted a cat! Barked at the cat he wanted, pawed the cat window and picked a cat tower. LISTEN TO YOUR SON
Kermit is that one kid in fortnite that waits for you to open the chest and steals your loot after you open it...😂
19:41 Foreshadowing?
Kermit: Mommy, I need a peepee...pissywissy....hello? I’m gonna keep touching things....where my dirt? I need territory...okay nvm my bladder is uncontrollable *pees*
I want an Italian greyhound like Kermit now
Pretty sure Marble was trying to tell you he wants a cat, a bird, a chinchilla, and a small child. Possibly to terrorize, but I suspect he just wants to get them all together in a ring and make them fight to the death. So. Yes. That is Marble's choice.
When u rich from dat yt money
DO THIS WITH BUNNY
“Is he buffering?” 18:32 😂😂😂
19million subs woww!
You can donate the stuff you won’t use to shelters! :)
Now bunny is eating those treats!
Marblea tongue will fall out 😂
Dog is just chillen then touches cat!
Some of those treats are the perfect size for Bunny
* Cermet touches a customer *

* jenna gets her wallet out *
Jenna: He just touched a giant hamster ball. What are we gonna do with that?
Me: thinks of Ad and instantly becomes sad
#theonlyadineverskipped
12:03 has to be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen 😂
Kermit is a kinky boi and this video confirmed it.
FazeRug did this
“what a dysfunctional squad” LMAOOOO that should be their squad name
Marble: 👁️👄👁️

Iggys:  👀     👀
             👅     👄
Jenna....I think it would’ve been easier for you to take them in individually...
Go to a soap store he will buy the Irish spring
to be honest i would die for marbles
Just buy marble the store. I mean he’s touching the floor
You should do this but for human clothes :))
Marbles is a cute little prancing pony.
10:01 10:01 10:01
My dog chews through everything and take a bit but longer than most, those sticks in the open boxes by checkout are really the jam. She loves the thick bone shaped one. Worth the price 100x over
They bring no leash for Kermit but bring two leashes for Marbles. . . . 😂
When you have too much money.
buy the floor
he said ou fresh breath kermit why dont you touch that im deaddd
This is very Cermentaining for me.
CONSPIRACY they put the most expensive dog food at dog eye level
Am I the only one laughing that Kermit picked out things for Bunny?
Mr marbles wants a cat
imagine how much money that was oh my god
Omg so many big doggy treats that bunny can have now
The iggies picked out toys for their big sister
They choose huge things that they can eat and you STILL UNDERESTIMATE THEM
6:54 pick up in iyle 3 😂
I'm low key disappointed they didn't get the cat tower
THE BROADWAY I WANNA BE TALL IS EVERYTHING!!! So talented
the sound of kermit crying with content aware scale sounds like when you try to push something against the wall in animal crossing
JENNA!! I was about to go to sleep but I had an idea! Please just buy a bunch of temporary tattoos and just cover your entire body in them...... thanks
WHY WAS THE BROADWAY VERSION SO NICE IS IT ON SPOTIFY
Tie your hair into different sized braids and use ends to do your makeup
Official petition for a Jenna Marbles full broadway musical.
I wonder what Jenna's "hell yeah" sounds like in the Russian voice over.
Okay the fact that she refused to take down the Russian voice-over channel even though they reposted every single video of hers just goes to show how she is literally the most genuine you tuber out there. Like when that girl copy striked pewdiepie because of some petty thing, she won’t even copy strike someone who actually used her content. I love her so much lmao
The girl that sang made me emotional holy shit what a voice!!!
There's something so heartwarming about Jenna saying she's cool with theRussian dubbed videos and all of her Russian-speaking fans thanking her for being understanding. <3 Rare to find positive vibes on the internet some days!
Jenna is literally the most unproblematic down to earth qUEEN with pure original content i love it
Kermit looks like an old homeless dude who was cremated and then someone tried to put his ashes back together with black magic
Me: should be studying for my 3 exams
Also me: GooOoOoOooOOOOdD MooOrRnNiInnNgGG KeeEEEerRRiIImIITTttt
Can we take a minute to appreciate how GORGEOUS jenna looks today
Wow random but I’ve been watching Jenna since webcam videos and she’s the only YouTuber I’ve never at any point been bored of.... when you mind your business you blossom
Wow can we just appreciate how BOMB she looks in this video?? Like, girl, those eyelashes? YES HONEY.
The Russian channel is so sweet honestly, like they spend hours translating!
The way they do the voiceover in Russian is just amazing actually! Like the intonations they use make it even funnier. Oh and a lot of Russian speakers find this original channel because of the камедистор channel.
Hello to you from Russia! Jenna, you and Julien are so cool, I love you! :) That Russian voice channel Камеди Стор is simply gorgeous! And in fact, people in Russia don`t think that you have a male voice :) Male voice is really funny! The author is trying very hard to convey you and your mood as accurately as possible! Moreover, this channel attracts fame to you here in Russia! Thank you again. This video was just awesome, I haven't laughed like that for a long time! :)
Imma start a petition to get Jenna Marbles to host meme review 😂
Like if you’re with me because she needs to see this 👍
Jenna’s genuine enjoyment seeing other people enjoying her content is the best thing I’ve seen in a while. She’s such a wonderful and wholesome woman who is talented at basketball and beauty hacks.

Edit: I did a painting of Jenna in her iconic leisure suit, it would mean the world to me if you guys would tag her in the comments of my Instagram post! My Instagram is @beccarart!
That did not feel like 18 min. Time really does pass by quickly when you’re having fun
It’s so obvious that she appreciates/loves her fans and doesn’t get upset whenever they make memes of her. It’s so refreshing. Plus she can laugh at herself which is amazing

"jenna marbles videos but there are no words'" MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD I AM NOT BREATHING OMG
Thank you for everything and especially for the kind words! Russia loves you!
The piano player (Daniel) is actually the one who wrote and composed the version of the song! So awesome!! ❤️
once easter rolls around, can you please turn yourself into a FESTIVE easter egg. like a full body and spiritual transformation into an easter egg. thanks beech
Thank you for responding well to the Russian channel, and to the Russian voice acting.♡🌸Thanks to the translation, we understand what you are saying
Thank you for supporting channel КамедиСтор. because I do not know English. and thanks to this channel I am familiar with your work. I always put likes on your videos. Greetings from Russia)
I wanna be tall Broadway version is officially my wedding song
Who else thinks Jenna marbles should get a tattoo of “HELL YA”
The random times when she used the voice filter were absolutely perfect
OOooOH MYYYYH GooOWWDdD THAAAAAnkk YOUUUUUU
damn that girls voice was so pretty
The jaws one. I can't 😂
nice memes 10/10
Everyone should go to savecermet.com 
Busch is more of a troll than y'all realize.
8:33 THIS ONE HAD ME DEAD 



I just cant 🤣
//Peach magically floats into frame//
Jenna: Put her down!
Peach: (;´༎ຶД༎ຶ`) //concerned cermet noises
//Peach magically floats out of frame before mom can delete her//
Как странно смотреть на Джену без мужского голоса, а про Джулиана я вообще молчу
The goddess of not copystriking. She is the Queen Mother of YouTube.
SHE HAS THE MOST PRECIOUS LAUGH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH MY HEART!!!!
Hey, look! it's my favourite YouTuber, Menna Jarbles!
Going back and watching Jenna’s video because the beauty community is in flames
--I love it how every single time you see or talk to Marbles your voice changes into puppy-talk, Lol. 'Oh Marbles...' 😆
Jenna needs that Broadway song as her new ringtone beech
Omg I love Novympia. I’m so glad you reacted to him👏👏👏
That’s so strange to watch foreign people listen to your native language
That live hell yeah concert is the content I signed up for
4:11 he's a part of the CLIQUE YASSSSS
We need Jenna to host meme review.
Ok but that broadway song was everything I never knew I needed
я очень люблю Камеди Стор и смотрю видео Дженны дважды - если не больше - в оригинале и с русской озвучкой, ибо это забавно. но, ребята, имейте, пожалуйста, больше уважения к Дженне. у неё не мужской голос, и даже если вы говорите, что думали так, в шутку, то это совсем не смешно. её голос ей прекрасно подходит, и не надо говорить, что мужской голос ей больше идёт. она тут контентмейкер. Камеди Стор предоставляет просто перевод и озвучку. это не его контент, а её. и она огромная молодец, что спокойно к этому относится. хотелось бы, чтобы вы это понимали и не сравнивали небо и землю.
Unfortunately I can't finish the video. I just had my tonsils removed and I'm in a lot of pain. The video of cermit whining made me laugh really hard. I've never experienced this amount of pain before in my life. I think I need to go to the emergency room now, I taste blood.
You are a very beautiful girl and talented! Greetings from Kazakhstan
Jenna is 5’5” : I wanna be tall


Me is 5’1” : um excuse me... wot the fook?

Как не привычно слышать ее настоящий голос😱
There were moments when I couldn't tell if Julien's laugh was in the room where Jenna was filming or on the edit. 😂
Jenna I've been away from your channel for a hot minute. I have missed you so much. Lol you look amazing! Thank you so much for making me laugh so hard! Lots of love 😍

If Jenna was to put on a red wig would she also look like Eminem?
I love how the Russian Jenna Marbles says Julien the same way. lol

How many times have you been told Kermit looks like Dobby the house elf?
"can I get a hell yeah?"
jenna: HELL YEAH
2:19 was so funny!🤣🤣
Who else thought that 6:37 it was a green screen
who remembers when jenna used to write a massive paragraph in the description box of every video
I need to go to the dentist in an hour.... My stomach hurts SO BAD but your videos make me calmer
Wait... she’s 32? 🤯🤯 I thought she was like 20
The jaws one had me dead 😂
На озвучке голос ржачнее

This outfit is making me think you might appreciate power. I will be happily surprised if anyone gets this
I from Russia and i watch your video on the channel "Camedy store" and it seams to me, dubbing suits you more than your real voice) 
I LOVE YOU! Hello from Russia!
Dogs are too pure for this world.
The broadway “hell yeah” should be your new intro
A full two months later and I STILL go back to this video 😂
Her laugh is so infectious hahaha, I love it!!
The love you have for everyone and the love we give back is literally making me sob.
I'm an Aries and i kinda am the same xD
the “can I get a hell yeah” part of the song sent me
Lindsay curses off heather uncensored
“Can I get a hell yeah?” Is my new ringtone
I saw another comment that said you should make yourself look like a cloud


I agree... Plis do  cries in Cermet
Green screen but you project yourself on vines and QUOTE THEM ALL!!
Jenna always looks amazing but omg in this video looking like a whole isle of snacks😍😍
He protecc 
He attacc 
But most importantly....
Kermit is nasty throughout his bacc
8:33 lmaooo the content aware scale video i haven't laughed that hard in a hot minute

Jenna looks absolutely gorgeous and glowing in this video (and always)
Смотрю видео Дженны 24/7 😃👋🏻
This is the best. Lmao watching your reactions is the funniest thing ever
Majority of Russians don't know English, Comedy Store just helps to watch your video <3
Kermit crying in content aware sounds like Pac-Man dying
Jenna to host meme review to stop T-series
That intro is for LWAIY not MEME REVIEW
5:23 did Jenna just turn into Cardi B? Lmao 😂
Bruh idk when she said oh shit chill made me laugh so hard
Seriously my favorite YouTuber :)
Wow that Broadway song was incredible and the fact that Jenna is cool with the fact someone’s uploading her content and doubling it over in Russian is so cute and so wholesome girl you do you. I just turned 30 the other day and I couldn’t stop saying I can’t wait to be a 32-year-old woman!
when she got to the video with no talking i actually started to get mad😂 bc i've seen all of her videos and ik what they are going to say then it DOESNT HAPPEN
Caution: 
When expanded Kermit can be mistaken for meercat.
I literally just realized you stopped using your sexual Wednesday intro 😭
James Charles has that shirt love jenne❤️
I want to be tall becomes a serious musical
14:12 I love this YouTuber so much 💛💛💛💛
I'm Russian and German!!!!😁😁😁
THANK YOU FOR REALIZING THAT FELIX RIPPED OFF JACK
This video helped me help a friend who needed helping. Thank you Jenna for helping the drunk people at parties 🎉
JENNA LOOKIN LIKE A SNACCC

Edit: sub to pewds
(Doing my part)
You should react to jnj memes cermet on Dr Phil
I finally get to see a YTber react to their Novympia parody. Joy.
Love ya Jenna since ERB!!.... keep up the hilarity!!🥰
Something that Jenna does (that not many other creators do) is make her content open to be reinterpreted and used in other people’s creative projects. She wants what she makes to be out there and change and evolve and isn’t interested in claiming the channels that make edits of her stuff. It’s pretty revolutionary in a world that is hyper vigilant to copyright. We love you mom.
i like how i can see Gerald in the background
I love youuuuuu <3
You are cutie donut :3
I got mad when she was talking about the liway (clearly forgot how to spell it) theme song and said it was the meme review's "theme song".
heee- ELLLLLL yeeeeAAAhhhh
In the era of false copystrikes, Jenna has a true copyright infringement in front of her and her response is “why would I have them taken down? People enjoy them!”

QUEEN 👑🖤
Hello! I m from Russia. Thanks  to the Russian channel Comedy store,I learn about your channel  and now I watch your videos in the original 😘
Thank you for not having 50 tabs open at once
This shaking video of Our lovely Cermitos has shown me that he is snoop dog reincarnated into an actual dog


He just is.
Y'ALL 👏👏👏👏 The official recording of the I Want To Be Tall Broadway Version is now on my channel!!!!!
My mom just walked in and asked “Is that Janet Merples” and I about died.
Your top's giving me 80s vibes, love it.

Petition on getting Jenna and Julien hosting 👏 👏 Meme Review!!
cinnamontoastken already does meme review w the claps intro too xD
Your laugh is so contagious. Thank you so much!
At the beginning with plum, the sound reminded me of charlie the unicorn 🦄
OMG I didn't even know that Russian channel existed (and I speak fluent Russian)... It's actually pretty hilarious lol
Moments like this make me really understand why Jenna is literally one of the few Youtubers with no drama or tea on them.
jenna to host meme review 👏👏
4min 01 is that HOMESTUCK !?!?!!
yo can we get that conservative pro trump ad to go away
write from Russia. thank you for allowing yourself to be voiced. Every time I follow the link in the description of the Russian channel and like your video! thank you for being there. kiss
how Jenna reacts to other people using her content is how everybody should behave! those copyright-strikers need to chill the flip down!
Her laugh is so contagious😂😂
Jenna Marbles: The Musical....I'll WAIT!
The dillon francis gerald pinata!!!!
“I was just trying to DERP AROUND”
I treat Jenna's videos like Thursday morning cartoons lol. I got my  cereal  girl I'm READY.

Also props to people who make meme videos. You are both a blessing to my life and a curse to my productivity lol.
I don’t watch any of the edits until
You upload a reaction video cause it’s like 10x as funny 😂
DO HAIR DRIP COLOR! 
It’s like the acrylic pour but for your hair!
If someone doesn’t make an entire broadway show out of ‘I want to be tall’ then wtf 😐
im legit scared tbh 😂
nobody: 
jenna: sorry i’m a virgo i just wanna be tall 🤠🤩🤪🤤🥵
Waiting here in 2019 for someone to make a teriyaki boys treat bell remix
2:21 I lost it
Pls react to the Bunny, Kermit, and Peach musical song videos!
On the next one you've GOTTA react to Kermit On Dr. Phil by JnJ if you haven't seen it!
My husband thought you said bean review instead of meme review. Please do a bean review next
ayy i’m an aries to beech! ♈️
MEME 👏 REVIEW 👏
this want to be tall version is fcking awesome. i'm not crying!!
THE RUSSIAN OVER DUB KILLS MEEEEEE
If Pewdiepie is the king of YouTube, I'd definitely say you're the Queen, a true OG
you know the snack bell musical is playing along to the music of crab rave right?
Did you meme to never put a squeak toy intro ever again
holy shit someone sign the broadway lady and her friend!!!!
I love when youtubers get animated
The I want to be tall broadway version was beautiful and gave me goosebumps 😭
Please tell me where you got that SEXY SHIRT!!!!!
Which video is julien throwing the baseball from? 😂 those clips cracked me up i need to see it
Dudes.  But seriously. I want to put that song in a musical.
That Kermit crying one made me literally cry 😂😂😂
Can anyone link where I can purchase the merch shirt she is wearing?? 🙌❤
Салют славяне !!!!!
OMG, your Russian fans are beeping right now.
Our queen helping us in the fight against T-Series 👏🏼♥️ we love you Jenna
YO I BET YALL KNOW BUT I WANNA BE TALL IS OUT FOR PURCHASE (or at least it's on Google play)
I want to be taaaaaaaall!!
the hell yeah song sounds like a crazy Jenna porn soundtrack 🤣😂🤣😂
James Charles wore that top in his video with you
Jenna is like a mother who is very biased and is just handing golden stars to all her children. It's so wholesome and I love it.
Combine the subs. Destroy T-series
That drop it song is actually called Let Me Hit It by Sporty-O
Kermit remix would be completely awesome
The basketball game tmrw video will always be the most iconic
Jenna is officially the best Creator. 
Other channel: takes her videos and reuploads them with a voiceover, not to rip off her content, but so that people who don't speak English can understand. 
Jenna: oh shit that's cool, keep doing it, look how many people are enjoying it. 
----
Like. I feel like she's the only creator who hasn't been "corrupted" by fans and money. She's still so pure
Kinda sad the person who made the jaws video didn't use the footage of marbles in his shark raincoat
I mean i ate unhealthy im 5"10 and 14. 🎵I wanna be shorter🎵
I was watching this while eating soup and I CHOKED
I love you so much you make my day when I wacth your videos
I love how Jenna is letting the Russian youtuber voice her over without taking the profits or shutting him down, whereas many other "big" youtubers would just take the money or start drama over it. We stan a wholesome queen <3
2:07 -  Your channel is officially in my heart forever! ! ! ! ! ! ! I remember "Full House" was my grandmother's favorite show !  The "Drop It' vid was great but . . .   3:22 - dub in the voice of the creepy android from the creepiest online videos - 'YOU LOOK FAN - - - - TA  - - - -STIC HEY-HEY-HEEEEEEYYYYYYYY" 15:29 -  I said, "the makeup" in perfect unison with you on the vid.  Granted, this guy would not survive a second around my male relatives, but I give him props!
Julien is really "annoying," but in the way that it's also funny. He always has me cracking up xD
The title implies shes seen PKRUSSLE HDHSJSJ
I've been watching you since 2009 and your doggies were no puppies when your channel came to be. In the words of Jacksfilms - "can't believe they're still alive somehow"
😂
Oh man, the one with the woman singing with the piano "TALL" was awesome.
I absolutely love the Gerald shirt on julien’s chair
Okay, so, st my school on Tuesday we are having meme day that's pronounced as (MEE-M) But some dude pronounced it as (meh-m) day. So now you are reacting to our mehms
Damn this is the same day she filmed with James...... 2 videos in one day? We love a productive sister 👏
15:18
SHE IS BEAUTY
SHE IS GRACE
Girl your hair and makeup is BOMB I LOVEEE😍😍
Lmaooo this video is copyrighted by Ariana 😂
I wish more singers would do renditions of the standards, like "I want to be tall."
Your officially my favorite YouTuber
HERE ME OUT



KERMIT AND PEACH CREAT THE TOKYO DRIFT THEME SONG WITH SNACK BELL
Meme review !  I don't know Jenna  was 9yrs old.
Cermit wheezing in content aware scale killed me 😂😂
I don’t know where I’ve been but I just became a new subbie. You have such diverse content and I love it 😊
What happened to your videos about Jeans?! I was just watching it and then I exited out and it was gone.
yessss jnj memes
kermit low-key looks like the sloth from ice age i just realized that
Leave you entries in the subreddit bros. And i’ll watch submissions in the next episode of LWAIY.
OMG THE I WANNA BE TALL REMIX. THE ABSOLUTE BEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. HAHA
Thank you for making videos they help me through my hardest days even when I’m breaking down you still manage to make me laugh 💖💖
YO run up that broadway cover vid!!!!!
The russian thing is quiete flattering tbh. They find Jenna so entertaining they translate it into a whole ass other language as a comedy show.
Poor Kermit got scared at the start of the video XD 
#DontScareKermit
LMAO the robot face on the first vid
The way she talks is just so cute I swear to heck

I'm here for the influx of Russian comments
OMG how is bunny gonna react the next/1st time you do the bell treat thing lol
5 hours later on Pewdiepie’s channel «bros we have a new rival in town»
SO IS THAT SHIRT J&J MERCH? Because I’ve been wanting to know where there shirt is from!!!!! And James said in his snapchat “As you can see by my merch” before he did his collab with Jenna. That patch on her right arm is the logo from their twitch stream. So is it merch??????  because I want it....


OKAY I FIGURED IT OUT. I don’t have Instagram or any social media so I didn’t know it was Juliens scrabble merch lol
I love your Gerald MERRRCCCHHH
the no words one killed me
We love a grateful mom who supports us supporting her
Russia with love <3

Wow I'm so happy Jenna marbles hosted meme review
you should put subtitles for julien whenever hes not in frame since it gets hard to understand him every now and then....
See, if there was a channel that i wouldnt mind overtaking pewdiepie in subscribers here it is.  A true queen of YT alongside with her loyal acolyte who brings tons of laughs.  Tuck F-series.
HOW DARE U THAT DOG AS A SICKNESS THATS JUST RUDE
You should one bay do a live stream
Thank you, Jenna. 
From Russia with love 
Many people in Russia can't understand what you say in your videos (me too, you see, my English is so simple) but I am happy that your opinion about Russian voice is positive. 
We love you and subscribe to your channel 
Thanks 🇷🇺 🇺🇸 ❤️
I love the Gerald pillow case :')
8:35 10/10 video
I Want to Be Tall is wonderful surrealistic genius.
Ok here HELLY YEAH
Can we just have Jenna Marbles - Hell Yeah The Musical?
4:13 did i spot a fellow bandito??? ;)
The Kermit one in content aware scale. I’ve never laughed harder
“HE’S A NASTY BOY!”- julien
HELL YEAH
That broadway song was lit tho
Omg I have the same kind of PC yay xxx
her basketball game was postponed until two days
Jenna, we <3 u. U Rock, bb. From Siberia flame hell yeah!
"No the one that's like a rip off of Felix's which is a rip off of Jack's" 💀💀💀
who told jenna to be this pretty tho
I would really appreciate if like the “7 rings” parody, someone could edit famous Jenna lines as ad libs in Migos songs 😂
That girl has me ready to buy tickets for the Broadway musical “I Wanna Be Tall”
the broadway "I wanna be tall" totally conceivable, it reminds me of any song from hair.
u look so ceeeeeeYUUUUUUUUUUTE
it’s actually really thoughtful that she’s not taking down those videos.
Can you do a video where you do art with Julian and then do a giveaway with the art! I think that’s super cool and personal and I know if I got one I’d love it! I’ve been watching you for yearsssssss xx
I love how much you enjoy this!
10:41 
I never knew how contagious Julien’s laugh is
omg I need these eyelashes!!! what are they !!!!! someone help ya girl out 😩
now we just need another yiay/lwiay parody
My jaw is still on the ground from I Wanna Be Tall Broadway version
2:22 I cannot stop laughing
In Russia they always put a male voice over the original, they’re crazy...
The tall song performed by that woman was a bop
NEVER stop making these
we need a Broadway show called 7inches taller
I love her lil scream 😂😂😂
The Russian voice over makes me laugh tbh.
Kermit is best boi, but he's a nasty boi
No, you can take down videos even if you do not intend to make the videos yourself. You have every legal right to take down videos that are your content, well, more than 50% I guess.
The Derrick Berry reference! 😂
jenna can you dye your hair again i love those vids! p.s you would look good in lime green
meme review with the intro of LWIAY
god damn that song tho

2:22 couldn't stop laughing
THE GERALD MERCH IN THE BACK

The song: “I wanna be taller” just makes me happy! It’s so good! 
I love you Jenna you’re awesome!!!!!
That feel when u realize Julien can be a nasty boi too! Lol
The taller song was frickin awesome!!!!
Jenna marbles: can I get a heck yes

Me: heck no
Oh my god Jenna's way of handling copy right is how all YouTubers should look at it😂❤️👌🖤

Edit: sweet baby Jesus I didn't expect the likes, thank you all so much😭 
I meant this in the way that some YouTubers copy right strike for the ridiculous reasons.
And I love how Jenna had literally her entire video on someone else's channel and she doesn't care, yes it's not technically copy right infringement. But there are YouTubers that strike people for stupid reasons. And she's just happy it makes other people happy.
The shark meme! Lol
You look so freaking pretty in this video
she has the same personality as jisoo from blackpink
7:37 "derp around" holy shiiiiiiiiiiit what decade is it
That broadway song is Jenna's new intro

It seems that the video was claimed by UMG? Bec of the 7 rings by ariana as per decription of the video. so sad jeena is not getting the monetization for this awesome video.

Screw Elon Musk. Like if you want Jenna to host meme review to stop tseries.

Jenna's shirt makes her look like Jeff Hardy in the best way
This is the funniest JM video ever😀

Its bizarre to see the Russian Jenna Marble voice over😂 i love it! They can truly say they are your number one fan! 😝
Do a meme review every week or every month
Official petition for Jenna and Julien to host Meme Review?
You have a nasty boi
I can't remember if I commented on this the other week or not, but the fact you are happy with people remixing/re-dubbing your videos - that makes you way better of a person than plenty of folks on here. 10/10 Pure wholesome channel.
i love that these are all in an incognito tab
Вся Россия сбежалась :D
I swear to god Jenna just gets more and more gorgeous as the years go by, I’ve been watching her for what almost 9 years?
You look beautiful 💜
Me Is Aries. Me Take Aries And Turn It Up To 100
The way Julien said “never” after Jenna told him to put down Peach made my heart warm for some reason.
I’m glad she saw the broadway version
pewdiepie has left the chat



btw im a small youtuber biiiitch
The dog animation is basically the reason I started watching your channel. 
(I’m so new I don’t even know the dog’s name).
CAN I GET A HELL YEAH!?
Put her down julien NEVER.
I think that in this video you look like Ariana Grande😻🙉😸

The Russian dubs are the funniest
Mr bright side!!!!!
You have the same shirt as James and you where wearing it in the collab
I think that Jenna and Julien are soulmates, that's a goal right there
14:56 get on my fkin level 😂😂😂
you filing with @paymoneywubby ?
cermit just naturally looks like the content aware filter
What is Julien playing the piano during that 
I want to be taller song with the lady singing ?
Jenna Marbles should be a pastor... Like could you imagine her getting really into a sermon and yell, "CAN I GET A HELL YEAH?" 
And the crowd is like, "hell yeah."
And Jenna yells back, "C'mon you can do better than that. CAN I GET A HELL YEAH?"
And the crowd yells, "HELL YEAH!!!"

I would attend that church.
Kermit in the background is so funny
The second one was hilarious
youtubes favourite show

Julien’s chaotic energy is a vibe
Love the Russian JULIAAAAAAAN
Watching this before watching the Bratz video and am now terrified to watch the Bratz video lmaoooo

Hi Jenna & Julien thankyou so much for watching my video I love you guys so much.Something happened to my channel after the adpocolypse so I set all my videos to private, changed my name to - , and gave up for awhile. It won't let me change my name back yet so if anyone is wondering my name is Jamie Lawrence Brown. Once again thankyou so much on this Valentines Day 2019. I won't be getting any Valentines cards but now I have lots of comments to read.About the Sofia thing.. I don't think you look like her it was just part of the meme train. Sorry if that was triggering.. Anyway I have to go call my mom and tell her I was on Jenna & Julien's meme review and wish her Happy Valentines Day. I love you guys so much :)
Virgos always love!!  😍😍😍😍😍 Aries !!!!!!!!♈😋😋😋😋😋

Джена, у тебя не мужской голос?! D: ШОК!

Nasty boy sits in the background...
This video is really funny, I love you, Jenna!
HELL YEAH
damn, i saw this girl named ariany grandy who stole ur song hell yeah, im so sorry. wasn't even close to the original smh.
So I've gathered that I Wanna Be Tall can either be a Disney movie or a horror movie and no inbetween
So weird i only saw 2 videos of yours before this one and in both you didnt really have makeup on, you look so unfamiliar now😂
ABSOLUTELY NYET
8:52 cermet makes new Mario sound effects
I can't stop laughing at Julien pitching that ball 😅
I'd never thought I'd see the day Jenna with her natural dark brunette hair but she looks so gorgeous with it
no one cares if youre from russia. just enjoy the damn video
Russian sub or dub. That's the real question.
This video wont everr get old
Всегда смотрю и оригинал и озвучку потом, ибо она делает видос даже более смешным)
Nervous boy Kermit in the intro
We don’t deserve Jenna Marbles lol so wholesome
Ох даа это очень клево. Ты сделала обзор на канал который озвучивает тебя. Этот канал действительно полезен для русских так как не все  знают английский
Did you use the entire tube of mascara today?
Russia loves you) I am very glad that you are not against the voice acting  of the Comedy Store, and come, I will tell you, we do not think that you have a man’s voice)I know English but I don’t really understand the meaning (I hope)
 We like u 🖤
Первый раз услышала её настоящий голос... мужской ей идет

Thumbs up to the "I want to be tall." Broadway version. 👏👍
the fact that y’all have a ushanka laying around scares me
lettuce suscribe (i meant to spell it that way)
The make-up is so good here :)
I was gonna say "wtf is she wearing?," but also, I dig it
That 'i wanna be tall' song has to be Jenna's main theme if she were a Disney princess 😂

That really was an amazing perfomance though
Is their a video of Kermit crying on autotune
emojis are invalid in any youtube title except for jennamarbles
The jaws one made me laugh so much
Hell yeah
High key jenna your makeup and lashes look SICK today 👍
#soapforkemit

the girl who did the broadway style singing did it so effortlessly omg
This is the best video on the internet
OML JENNA ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE FRICKING DROP DEAD GORGEOUS IN THIS IM JEALOUS JULIEN IS A LUCKY MAN

There was a Emma Chamberlain video in that russian voice over channel
I loved the Kermit animation
Kermit troubles my sense of humor
Someone give this amazing whamen a leisure suit and a glass of wine!!!
Дженна без русской озвучки мы бы просто не смогли бы смотреть твои видео=ъ К сожалению не все знают английский на хорошем уровне.
Can't believe Julian is finally gonna have his own roll in the horror edits
Everytime Julian gets some extra hair he becomes so violent😭😭😭
“Did it just get cold in here cause I’m a BRRRRRATZ
I laughed so hard that I cried.  Oh my god.  He looks like a LITERAL NIGHTMARE when he smiles with teeth.
nobody:
julien: im a   B R A T Z
Julien: gets tattoos all over his skin and doesn't even flinch
Also Julien: get eyeliner done one (1) time and cries

New video: plucking a hair of my boyfriends eyebrows every time he gets a question wrong or... doing my bf’s eye brows
Julien as a bratz looks just like the demon I see during sleep paralysis
Julien is the real definition of a supportive boyfriend.
genie: okay you get 3 wishes, what will be your first one
me: for Jenna marbles' dogs to live forever
Genie: okay I'm just gonna do that anyway you still have 3 wishes
You should have titled this "Tana Mongeau Collab"

This is exactly what Jenna got her master's degree for.
I feel like he looks like someone from A Clockwork Orange
Nobody:

Absolutely nobody:

Julien: I don’t listen to anyone because I’m a BRATZ
Lowkey when he’s far away he looks amazing

Damn, Tana got messed up.
9:25 I'm literally dying from laughter.. my stomach hurts 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
OH MY GAWD HE LOOKS LIKE HES WEARING THE CAVEMAN #2 PROSTHETIC
12:34 the way he walked up to the camera was literally something out of a horror movie lmao
He reminds me of the guys from white chicks😂
It actually looks really good with the wig. Without the wig... nightmare fuel.
If it's any consolation, Bratz dolls are horrifying up close too
Petition to make Jenna the most subbed to beautuber on the platform !
I’m high and drunk af and he looks LIKE A LEGIT BRATZ DOLL I’M SHOOOOK

Seriously the best video yet 🤣🤣🤣 dying from laughter
I was feeling really sad because a good friend of mine just died and this made my day a lot better. Thank you for always being on my screen when I need u❤️❤️❤️
Julien's eyebrows at 2:40 look like the skin of the old guy playing chess by himself in a bug's Life
Holyyyy shitttt i haven’t laughed this hard in a long ass time. 
Holy shitttt
this video clearly demonstrates that Jenna has earned a well deserved spot in the beauty community
You have pretty much just brought my nightmares to life.
You must be so used to Julien that you don't laugh at everything but I laughed reeeeeeally hard out loud when he made the GTG joke. You two are beyond adorable and make me laugh. Thanks :)
DO HAIR DRIP COLOR! 
It’s like the acrylic pour but for your hair!
Why he look like motherboard from the PBS show cyberspace
Julien: doing nothing but sitting 
Jenna: “what ever you’re doing, don’t. Just don’t” 
💀😂
jenna lately i’ve been stressed and kinda really sad and this made me cry from laughing so hard😭. it was soooo funny thanks guys😭💘
Some couples go to dinner together, some go to the movies. But jenna and julien... Well.... They do this. 🖤
Go outside like that and everybody will run away...XD
"Did you make an appointment?"
I peed my pants because I laughed so hard.
“Did it just get cold in here cuz I’m a BRRRRRRATZ” 😂😂😂
I'm getting mad white chicks vibes😂😂
when julien takes the wig(s) of at the end he looks like kris jenner lmao
I actually cry from laughter every time I watch this😂😢
Perfect example of Julian being a Aries
Why does this look like Bratz : Fight Club edition
I'm crying omg xD this is amazing
This is literally the BEST bratz transformation I have seen so far.
"GTG GET THAT GLITTER THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY, PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK IM LEAVING THO"
Julian: STAY TILL THE END OF THIS VIDEO!

Me: Yes Sir- I mean Ma’am- I mean Brats
Me: is waiting for the Bratz horror trailer
JULIEN!!!!!- “Is it cold in here?” Lol I’m 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Juiens lips look like Kermits eyes... wet (but he is such a good dog I love him)
Thank you so much for making this. I haven’t laughed that hard for that long in a while. I appreciate the hours spent!
YO THATS SUPER CREEPY! BUT GREAT JOB ON HIM GIRL! lol
Dude Julian looks like a bad extra for the movie White Chicks
I physically rolled on my bed laughing uncontrollably. Like my dog was actually really concerned. His face just karate chopped me in the giggle box.
"Its harder to do on it someone else" 
It's especially hard to do on Julien.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT 10:47 BECAUSE IM WHEEZING
Nothing on the internet has made me more uncomfortable than the close ups of his eyes/eyebrows
“my bratz mitzvah” -julien solomita 2k19
Tbh I want that bathroom
Your bathroom is huge, love your boyfriend hair clip x
Yooo im going to have nightmares tonight.. 😩😂🤣
He looks like he could be a 3rd sister for White Chicks. 
This is amazing
is this sleep paralysis but without the sleep
Would love to see him out in public in this makeup and outfit interviewing people. 😂😂 id pay money to see that.
That was amazing. Amazing. I have a problem. At least now I can be honest. I am in love with your relationship and pretty much the both of you. What do I do.
My bf and I are dying watching this lol, esp julien with the crazy grin, lol my bf said it's a remake of white chicks
I have watched this so many times and I cry laughing every time. Especially when he stands in the background and goes “hey, come here!”
Dr phil: send him to the ranch
Julien  was walking thourgh the street 

Everyone: damnn
Me in the corner squealing from how cute your guys dog is 😭
4:03 “gtg” “get that glitter” I have never laughed so hard 😂😂
@ 11:50 That face will haunt me in my dreams for eternity
Did it just get cold in here because I’m a BRRRatz
I legitimately was crying while watching this!!!! 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I loved this! The ending where you guys find out it's waterproof amazing hahah
yo julien i got your back bro! i audibly laughed (aka lol...ed) at the gtg joke! solidarity.
The lips made julien look like a creepy clone and for some reason Pennywise was the one that came to my mind. 😂😂😂😂😂
Part of me thinks it looks good and part of me thinks it's terrifying
Been laughing so hard! This is brilliant thanks for making my day 😂❤️

Tchaikovsky’s waltz of the flowers is on the background ... I thought I was going crazy

When you do your boyfriend's makeup and he leaves you for himself

“i was more of a imma go outside and put some worms in my pocket kind of kid”
Omg pure white chicks vibes absolutely creasing! Great job 🤣🤣
12:32

Omg, this is too funny, I can’t 😂😂😂😂
4:50 actually killed me 😂😂😂😂😂
13:20 OMG😂😂😂 "Are you okay??" "Yehhh I feel great!"
When he started throwing punches I actually lost it. This is Oscar worthy.
omg this is my favourite video on youtube!!!
he looks like a jojo's bizarre adventure character
New form of Anime, but it is still cool thou, u guys are great
Haha love the ending 😂👌🏼
Julian as a Bratz and yelling "Hey you come here!" is the most terrifying thing ever
10:40 
"@meundies" 
don't blame me, ok?!
I’m in physical pain from laughing so fucking much 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 best video ever
When Julien jumped it says @meundies 😂 😂 😂
I'm having White Chicks flashbacks
Alternative title: Jenna teaches Julien how to breath out of his nose
omg do a vid w James Charles where he does Julien in drag and you could get box'd Mac and cheese the GLOW UP
6:55 7:08
🤣🤣👁👅👁
I about pissed my self laughing
Ya know, if you rreeeallly squint, it isn't THAT bad😂
Watching the results all I can think about is White Chicks and I’m not mad about it
They could make a bratz horror movie from this lol
This is by far the best Bratz makeover video I’ve ever seen 😂😂
I have never cried of laughter this much in my life
I cannot stop laughing holy cow I'm crying

(0:17)

no offense to him but for 10 seconds he looked like Gru from despicable me 😂
no one:
julien: from afar 
👋🏼👋🏼hey com’ere!!! come over here!!
Why does Julian give off the muscular power puff girls vibe
lick the glue stick on your last layer. Elmers glue is non toxic and trixie mattel (winner of drag race all stars 3) uses that method because your saliva breaks the glue down a bit and smooths it out
Damn... After thought 🤔 ur bathroom is fkn insane 💕💞😍
Almost peed myself😂 you NEED him in your vids
imagine trixi martel doing juliens make up haha xD
I appreciate this content. Other Youtubers need to get on your level.
Damn this is hands down the funniest shit I have seen on YouTube in a while
😂😂😂😂
I laughed so hard, y'all are a trip!
I can't breathe and I'm gunna have nightmares now 😂😂😂
i’m up at 4:30 am with the flu watching this🤠
Oh, idea! Next time you try to cover Julienuh's thiccc eyebrows use sfx makeup! Glue them down and then use a cover like liquid latex or something or the sort, it'll look waaaay better texture-wise ^•^
"when you look at me, close your eyes"-Julien 2019
julien stole the spotlight, this was amazing i couldn't stop laughing 😂
I spit my whole drink out 💀😂😂😂😂👌🏼
LMGDMFAO!!! I've only ever laughed this hard once before in my life!! THANK YOU!
What if you could hear out of your eye brows???!! 😂😂
Julien looks like a bratz doll thats been through hell, like.. shower in the washing machine, been thrown out the car window, hung on the clothing line by her hair, slept in a letterbox and lastly dumped in food.
looking at  his lips, it's like that anxiety of getting hair stuck in your lipgloss just came over me
I am literally laugh crying. So hilarious
This shit cracks me up every time
Shave juliens brows!!! 😂
"whatever you're doing, dont." - jenna marbles 2019
Jennnnaaa! You should make a video about you creating different braids with your hair 🤣😭👌✨ I can only do like ...negative one myself, so good luck
has nobody noticed the @meundies on his crotch when he does the air kick? 😅
When they realized the makeup wasn't coming off I literally lost it
Why when I first saw him he reminded me of one of the kardashians 😂
I NEED A HORROR EDIT OF THE NEW IT 2 TRAILER WHERE THE OLD LADY COMING AT BEV IS REPLACED WITH BRATZ JULIEN RUNNING AT THE SCREEN PLEASE MEME MAKERS MAKE MY DREAM COME TRUE!!!
This video was everything thank you 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Remember when Julien straight up got posessed by a chloe doll
I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
the end result looks like if the movie white chicks had an anime spinoff
how have you not turned him into Gru from despicable me
8:39
If you squint ur eyes you can see how funny it looks 😂
why does he look like manny mua
"I'm a go outside and put some worms in my pocket kinda kid"  why is this sentence like the essence of jenna
this is so funny im cryingggg
Hahaha julian is the best! Should have completed the look with fake tatas 🤣 great job guys, he looks great
I can’t even tell you how hard I laughed this entire video. 😂
This is literally the most hysterical thing I’ve ever seen I laughed so hard I was crying
Julien is the best good sport that ever sported good.

"Don't, don't, whatever you're doing, don't." WE ALL KNOW ONE PERSON THAT WE HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS TOO

For the longest time I thought that Julian was also Zain from the Vlog squad

It's like Bratz Doll meets the movie White Chicks!
For covering his brows after the last layer put powder on and orange color correcter
This video has me in stitches every time I watch it lmfao
Julien is such a good boyfriend 😂😂
Getting serious Steve carrel in foxcatcher vibes lol
That bratz reveal reminds me of movie white chicks 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I came here from cavetowns liked video lmao
Julian looks like he hopped out of a scene from White Girls 🤣😂😂
This is my favorite one yet 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
I was  in such a bad mood and I thought this was what I needed
I was right 
I love you guys so much 😂 you bring me so much joy I could rewatch your videos 100 times 😂
Jenna's creative process:
- a mess
- a huge mess
- a disaster
BOOM!
- huge SUCCESS!
- an apocalypse in the aftermath
When Julien came out throwing punches 😂😂😂😂 IM A BRATZ
julien's bratz persona is what i see during sleep paralysis
Omg this was hilarious!! 🤣🤣🤣
LMFAO love u guys💕💕💕
Why is this not trending?  I'm wheezing.
This looks like a major drag look. Good stuff. I cant stop laughing haha. Yall make a awesome team! My new fav channel

well from far away
Oh my god.. Julian looks exactly like Corey Feldman in Corbin Nash.. It's really unsettling.
I couldn't stop laughing 😂😂

Anyone know how long they've been dating?
Litually cry laughing at your videos 😂😂❤️

Jenna:”do u kiss ur mouth with that mouth”

Julien:*continues* 😂
I keep looking at the wrong pupils
omg love music from Nutcraker
Jenna: “How do you feel?”
Julien: “I feel beautiful... I feel bratty.. actually to be frank, I’m in pain.”

Me too Julien 😂
Julien is such a sport I love your dynamic you guys!!!
OMMMMGGGG THAT LOOKKS REALLY GOOD THOUGH, oh my goodness! Really good. Up close though I see what you mean but don't be so hard on yourself. Because its really good lol
i was in a production of the lion king a few years back.......this gave me flashbacks to the makeup.
Scarier looking than momo! Im going to see this in my nightmares! should have definitely walked down a street to see peoples reactions!
I want a boxing match with tall Jenna vs bratz Julien
Your natural color is SO GOOD! I think your so beautiful Jenna....and mother fucking hilarious...like, can't breath I am laughing so hard hilarious! You and Julian both!! ❤
OMGOSH this is perfect! I feel inspired!
This is. Challenging. To look at.
Stoooooop I can't watch this I haven't laughed so much thanks for taking my mind off my cancer pain day nothing was working medication nothing laughter is a medication thank u guys xxxxxxxxx
so are we finally gonna see a rise of julien centric horror edits or-
Bit of a late comment but I love this so much.
A little tip after you glue down the eyebrows put some power on it then the foundation. I have thick eyebrows and setting the glue kinnnddaaa helps. 
But julian looks clicks tongue top notch.
I have never cried-laughed so hard in my life 😭😭😭
God I keep losing it i can't watch😂
Julien was all for it until he realized it wasn’t coming off in the shower 😂😂 “Jenna turn the camera off right now” lol 😂 he looked utterly terrified
This video just makes me think that Julien is like Jim when Pam brings him into The Finer Things Club. And the beauty community is TFTC.
"TJ Maxx specialty"
That karate jump killed me💀💀💀
Omg I thought I was crazy for putting worms in my pocket!!! I did it for my mums rose in our garden though :D so it would grow faster
I love how Julien assumes Bratz are supposed to be brats
He looks terrifying but also perfect
Julien is the king of dad jokes 😂😂😂
Why does he remind me of white chicks?? 🤔😆
I love you guys together
I don’t know what to think at this point, I just watch jennas videos and don’t question it.
Oh my freakin God!! I can't stop laughing!!! I'm gonna pee!!! 🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omg im dying😂 what even happened 13:19
12:11 when Jenna tells him he looks brutal u can literally see him frown all of a sudden and that had me dyinggg😂😂
HAHAHAHAHA NOO!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  I love the comparison  and the way he waddles. Oh sweet Lord, it’s like a horror movie.
i feel another horror movie trailer coming for this video 😂
WHAT HAPPENED TO MOQ?!!? I miss that beech! Also, 2:43 omg!!! Don’t don’t! Lol!! 2 steps ahead of an Aries! Lololol!!!! And 3:56 these are my fav on this video! Idk why it makes me lmao!!!

Julien should be on keeping up with the Kardashian’s
The end result actually looks so good 😂
I’m just waiting for the horror film edit
Oh my god the lips had me in shambles. Too good 😂😂
If no one makes a horror trailer I'll be PISSED
I aries relate to him repeatly karating all over and then regretting everything when the makeups  waterproof
Y'all know who's Carmen de Mairena? look for it, min 9:46
Julien DESERVES the most tolerant boyfriend award
This one made me cry laugh.
GTG❣ 😂😂😂
Why is this amazing😂omfg Julian in the full outfit is my favorite thing ever
This made me laugh so hard I thought I was gonna vomit.
Also, Chole!Julian is what my sleep paralysis daemon looks like
The beauty community?? Done - Over - Irrelevant
Jenna's beauty Salon?? Thriving - Lit - Dominating the World
Best bratz challenge! Omg this has me dying 😂😂😂😂😂
I've never laughed so hard omfg
I laughed the whole time and when he isn't directly in the camera or I should say close up he legit looks like Chloe and I love it😭😂😘
I just realised ge doesn't have a beard...idk y i commented this
“Is it cold in here? Because I’m a BRRRRRATZ!” I cannot deal with Julien.

Personally I think it looks pretty good from a far 😂😂
Can't wait for the horror edits
12:09 had me sounding like a kettle, thank you Jenna- bless
The end result is what nightmares are made of, but I love it :D :D
Legends say if you watch this at 3 am Bratz Julien will appear at the foot of your bed.
this made my CRY i'm dying over here
No one:
Julien: “im a bratz I don’t listen to anyone”
Idk why this video doesnt have more views, easily the funniest video youve ever posted, I watch it when Im feeling blue and it ALWAYS cheers me up :)
"My anime boyfriend"
This is exactly what I see during my sleep paralysis
when julien stepped out in the reveal he looked like he was from White Chicks LMAO
WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE MISS PIGGY WITH THE WIG AND THE MAKEUP IM SCREAMING JENNA WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
This is very disturbing. 🤣🤣🤣
I'm getting some white chick vibes from him💀🤣
Julien looks like if Ronald McDonald wore drag 😂
no one :
julien : 👁👄👁
Hi Jena! I am your Russian subscriber. You're the best! I constantly watch your videos. I want to say that you are not too upset because of the haters, because you are beautiful, your smile and your laugh! When you uploaded a video about comments from haters, I almost burst into tears. (I'm also a little Kermit, just want to cry)
I have no fkn IDEAA WHAT UR TALKIN ABOUT THAT LOOKED SO FREAKING GOOD 😱😱 n Julian is hiiilllaaarrriiioouuusssss 😂I laughed so much I felt psycho and my cheeks n abs hurrrrtt 😂😂😂
the music in the background lmao
Use purple glue next time!!! Love you both
If white chicks and bratz did a collab 😂
I was literally crying.. laughing so hard!
Moq needs to return with an updated look! Just sayin!
wtf do you guys like ever bang?
Seriously one of my favorite videos on the internet 😂
“No I don’t care about my parents because I’m a BRATZ” 😂
There was a legit moment when Julien became a Bratz doll...SHOOK
He Reminds  me of a Weird version of the guys on white chicks 😂
Even whrn the video isnt about him, kermit still looks like a 24/7 mood @ 1:24
This video is the closest to my birthday. 




My birthday is February 6.
Jenna's true skill, creating nightmare fuel/horror edits
This is my favorite video, I've watched it 3 times
Yo she look a little bit like Gabbie Hanna. 



No reason just yeah
Don’t worry Julien, I laughed at your joke!😊
Stoppppp you actually did SO good
tell me why it looked so rough during the whole video but then when he walked out at the end it looked SO good
Next time for the eyebrows:
Brush the eyebrow hairs up and down. A.k.a the way the hairs are growing after you put one layer of glue on the brows.
You did a great job Jenna. Julian does look 👀 like a nasty villain though xxx 😆🤪💖🧟‍♂️
Okay but why does Julian look like he's from White chicks?
I get hella White Chicks vibes from this
Dying laughing the entire video. The eyes are so freaky and Julian reminded me of Mrs doubtfire at the very end haha
Did anyone else notice Kermit at 9:41
This made my day
this made me actually cry with laughter 😂❤️
I LAUGHED THE ENTIRE VIDEO. WTF DID I WATCH? I’m not even mad tho.
Edit: Julien in the last 5 seconds killed me.
“hey you, come here!”
runs for my life
I'm so overtired I had to pause this for a few minutes to catch my breath IM DYIng
Crack head looking Bratz
C L O W N  T I M E
Jenna:*covers Julien's brows*

Also Jenna:*puts the new brows on the old brows*
when tana mongeau entered at 10:23 i was shook
0:57 vaguely reminds me of gru from despicable me
This is what I see during sleep paralysis
6:55 when you did your makeup for the first time to impress your crush but he just thinks your a lunatic.      I had that experience yesterday 😂😂😭
4:10 I got yelled at for laughing in school .... it was worth it
Everyone deserves a love like y’alls 😂 💕
Oh so funny. I scared my cat I was laughing so hard 🤣
Lol at the flexing . Far away it looks really good Jenna !
I don't think I stopped laughing this whole vid
you seem so worried about messing up and what people are gonna say, i hope too many people aren’t being mean in the comments and i hope you’re not reading too many mean ones :\ ♥️
“What if you could hear out of your eyebrows?” 
😂😂😂
What i see in the corner of my room when I have sleep paralysis 12:33
in the end of video "Buffalo Bill dance Goodbye Horses"....XD

it's very cute and scary)
Julien: looks in the mirror
Also Julien: oh F*CK
“Pencause me” 😂
She didn't turn Kermit into a Brat(z) because he already is one
Totally reminds me of White Chicks!
GOLD 💀🤣😂
This video is so funny it made me cry laughing 😂😂
He looks like bubbles from the power puff girls in that episode where those men dress as the girls😂😂😂
I can hear the horror edits being made right now
I can't stop laughing!!
This is literrally the power puff girls when old men took there identity.
Did he say don’t subscribe 😂😂
The ending kills me every time I see it 😂😂😂
At some point Julien got swapped with Tana Mongoose
WHY DO I HAVE THAT BRATZ DOLL STILL. 😂😂
Imagine julien playing the joker in Batman the dark knight with this makeup...Heath Ledger laugh ur heart out 😂😂😂
I made the mistake of watching this in my school library and i was laughing so hard i was crying and they told me to get out LMAOOO
💀💀 In DIEING
julien making bratz puns and saying the word bratz for 70 hours
Why does the end result remind me so much of the movie white chicks 😂. Loved every minute of this.
Just what I thought, it's completely fkn waterproof
Oh my God I haven't laughed that hard in forever
OMG!!!! I cant stop laughing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I should not have watched this while at work! Secret laughs hurt! lol
now they're just asking for horror edits
На русском было лучше 😂
Я никого не слушаю, потому что я Братц😂😂😂
i laughed at you boo boo don’t you worry!😂😂
If a man with that face told me to get on his windowless van I would absolutely do it. 9:23
OMG. I laughed so hard I cried. This was awesome to watch.
I love how they flip flop between who’s the sane one depending on the video
Julien is taking the word “bratz” I lil to seriously 😂😂
Totally got “White Chicks” 🎥  vibes and could not stop laughing 😂
Omfg 😂😂😂❤️
12:13 
You're welcome for the nightmare fuel.
get u a man that is secure enough with their masculinity to feel comfortable and OWNING wearing makeup
But does it ever come off😂😂😂😂
AH-MA-ZING! They both make me laugh so much! My hubby would never let me do anything like this to him! I just love this video so much!😂😂😂 And Jenna I thought it looked very real when he stands back a little! Way to go!
Video idea, james puts julian in full drag
12:11 is a look 😂😂😂
I couldn’t breathe when I looked at julien 🤣
I was laughing so hard at this video 😂😂
whats the background music yall? Soothing AF
Julien’s bratz lips make me so uncomfortable lmaoooo I can’t stop laughing
It’s been a while since I didn’t scream and laugh soooo loud
Me trying not to piss my pants for 15 minutes
I. Lost. It. So freaking funny!
the skirt actually looks great on him. lol
WHY is Julian’s Bratz persona a crime-fighting bodybuilder who is overly aggressive? 😂
Ad: so just lying down,we are going to focus out attention
Jenna:heY
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed hard in my life 😂
Most comments: making fun of Juliens atrocious presence as a BRATZ doll

Me: okay but when are y’all getting married like




WERE WAITING 
this whole video made me uncomfy
I feel like julien is more of a jade than a chloe, but that’s none of my business
I just love how supportive he is no matter what.
I CANT BREATHE
Love this video!!! 🤣🤣🤣
This is iconic
This is literally a depiction of my nightmares.
This was so relatable 😂❤️
He looks like the pokemon Jynx...
I NEED SOMEONE THAT DOES DRAG TO MAKE JULIEN A DRAG QUEEN TO SEE IF HE'S EYEBROWS ARE FOR REAL THAT DIFFICULT TO COVER
He kinda just looked like a horror movie version of Tana Mongeau
Limited edition buff brats doll her name is Julien
what happened to loren gray
He looks better than some of the girls makeup at my school 😂
14:35 That's some serious rooster energy 😂
Every other YouTube channels: dying from scandals
Jenna marbles:   turning boyfriend into bratz doll
IM CRYING AT THE ENDING LOL
'SCUUUSE ME
12:15 the SCARIEST thing ive ever seen 😂😂😂
WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND SONG I NEED to KNOOwWWwWwoWWWWW

whats up with criminal guy bubbles from PPG XD
Okay, remember the vid with James Charles. We need this with Julian
7:16
I wheezed
You did good Jenna! Just went too low with the bottom lip.🥰
Julien: "Gtg...get your glitter... Everyone aways think I'm leaving tho.." Dead.
I never laughed so hard in my life
I’m still just out here wondering how the hell they managed to get that turtleneck over that makeup😂
This video doesn’t even need a horror edit because this is SCARY
11:44 That’s actually terrifying
Someone needs to go out in public looking like that!!!! 😂😂😂😂
Scar wax is hard to use but it’ll smooth down his brows after you glue them, for future reference if you ever wanna try that super extra bs. Just remember to use Vaseline on your fingers when smoothing it down if you do.
WHY IS THIS GOOD THO😂😂😂
For the first half he looked like Gordon Ramsay getting into a disguise
If anime character was real  😂
This video made me laugh so hard and I’m sick so it just made my day
This makes me miss Moq, any chance we can see how she's been doing?
The longer you look at it, the more real it looks, and the more traumatizing it becomes.
Dude at 5:40 all I saw was lightning mcqueen
i'M WhEeZiNg 😂😂😂
Hahahahaha this awesome. Yall are a trip
In the end it look realy good❤
i’m now convinced julien was born to be a bratz doll. a fabulous aries in his prime.
THE FIRST SOUND OF YOUR VIDEOS SHOULD BE THE SQUEAKY TOY. BRING IT BACK!!!!
i did a face mask while watching this and needless to say it almost fell off many times
Is someone gonna make a horror edit of Julian as a bratz
Hey Jenna I love youuuu, and I have literally watched your videos since you started YouTube, I have a fun idea get James to do Julien as a brats doll 😂😂😂 ofcourse once things settle down with bunny!!❤️❤️But maybe just think about it😂😂cause I think it would be hilarious cause he’ll come out looking like a glorious queen bratz 😂😂😂😂
The result is so scary like the other time that Jenny had become the armchair......

I’m ready for nightmares✌️
Every now and again I remember Jenna has a Master's degree and I think...I can make it in the world too
It's so good. It looks like Julien does this in his spare time when no one is around.

“You know what?”
“What”

“*i know*”
With the hair and clothes he looks like those dudes from white chicks 😂😂😂
I hate myself for not watching this sooner... I cry laughed throughout the whole thing😂
I've never laughed harder than I do at Jennas videos
“i was a i’m gonna go outside and put some worms in my pocket kinda kid” 🤣🤣😫
This is what you see in the corner of your room during sleep paralysis
BEST VIDEO AT LEAST FOR ME!
Waiting for the horror edits
They are the ultimate YouTube couple.
in the beginning of the video Julien looks like Tarzan.
I clicked so fast I got whiplash
4:08 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😫😫
When he was far away saying “come here” he literally looked like an aspiring pennywise
This is another one of those videos I am going to rewatch when I need to laugh
you guys know that movie 'white chicks'
"did it just get cold in here? cause im a brrrrratz"
I hope moq comes back. #YOURWELCOME
Is that Bianca Del Rio
He looks like he's from White Chicks! 😂😂😂💀
@ 9:40 Kermit looks terrified 😂🤣
jenna ”I was the type of kid to go outside and put worms in my pocket”
julian “what if you could hear out of your eyebrows?”
😂
It actually looks good.... I cried from laughing so much..... heyyyyy from beantown
I want to make my husband do this so badly
I literally almost pee'd myself lmfao 😂
9:45 OOO YASSS
Julien as a bratz doll gives me mega white chicks vibes
Julien looks like the type of Bratz to help the basketball team behind the bleachers 9:00 👀💪🏀
Lord, Jenna needs to take like 20 chill pills. Always yelling at Julien like shes his mom 😂
I was watching this while TRYING to drink some water. I couldn't stop spitting it out when I saw Julien.
IM CRYING SO MUCH FOR LAUGHING
jenna’s obviously a beauty guru
6:57 the sleep paralysis demon in the corner of my room
OMG AT 10:40 IS WHEN IT STARTS GETTING REAL IM SCREAMING
9:40
Cermet wants to be a BRATZ
6:56 Has me dying e v e r y t i m e
He looks like the off-brand Bratz doll you buy at the dollar store
7:07 omg me when my mom stares me trying to do my make up for the 1st time
the eyes actually look crazy good omg
I really appreciate the nutcracker music in the background
Waltz of the Bratz
the last few seconds show the face of pure terror
This had me actually crying and I don't know if it's from laughing too hard or if it's from fear
Omg dyingggg
😂😂😂😂
JENNA!! I was about to go to sleep but I had an idea! Please just buy a bunch of temporary tattoos and just cover your entire body in them...... thanks
THE ACTUAL HORROR ON HIS LITTLE FACE AT THE END
I see no transformation. Julien has always been a brat.....😂😂
this video made me fart from laughing so hard
You two are so adorable. Reminds me of me and my ex husband. Except we broke up and he's gay now.. but he's my bestie still !
TERRIFYING. I love it.
I didn’t stop laughing the whole time
The horror edits will be so good
He looks like a really messed up wii character
I watch this at least once a week, idk why this doesn't have as many views as some of the more recent ones
This is literally the funniest video ever f**** love it it came out so amazing literally looks exactly like her and I saved it to all these different playlist I have just so I can watch it again like absolutely died laughing the entire time amazing I give it an A+ plus 100%
This is actually really good tho
“Is it cold in here cause I’m a BRRRRRatz” Julien, 2019
I thought you were doing Bratz dolls, not Bianca Del Rio
Wow! I didn’t know Jenna and tana were collabing!
I am dying :) Hahahahaha
Get you a “go outside and put worms in my pocket” kind of girl. 💕
When his eyebrows are covered and he has nothing on his face he looks like one of the superheros in The Incredibles 2!!! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I've watched this 7 times...
I laughed at the gtg joke (got to go-thinking your leaving) get that glitter*girl
I can not stop laughing!!!
Alternative title:
My boyfriend doesn't know how to breathe out of his nose for 15 minutes
Looking bootyful ❤️
GTA character design really went downhill ngl
currently re-watching this because I remembered how much it made me scream laugh, and how much I cried because of laughter.
He looks like one of the brothers from white chicks when they imitate the girls😂
Yooo this video is off the chain!!! Lmao yoh shut your eyes when you look at mee!!

Julien: exists
7:09 made me cry laughing oml
I laughed so hard through this THANK YOU my life is better now
I'm crying! 😂

JULIEEEEEEEEEEEN
pointer for the eyebrows for future reference Jenna, after you glue them let the glue dry entirely and cover with a translucent powder then do a layer of orange concealer and THEN move on to regular concealer! You did really good though!!!! He looked terrifyingly adorable hahahaaaaaa
00:50 to 1:03 listen closely and u can hear kermit breathing😂

IM SOBBING
I laughed so hard omg
Ok I might be on something but why does this actually loom kinda good???
This made me laugh so hard xD
That kick killed me omg
Julien and Jenna are literally the only Youtube couple who can genuinely make me laugh
“I was more of a ‘I wanna go outside and put worms in my pocket’ kind of kid” Same!!
It actually looks really realistic at 12:00 😂😂
I haven’t laughed this hard in so long omg I needed that
11:21 😂😂😂😂 nightmare material
Somebody needs to do a horror edit of this, im legit terrified
This was painfully funny
Can someone please make a horror/momo edit of this please
His lips are haunting 😂😂😂

That drag queen from Shrek has lost weight over the years.
Happy birthday Julien
It’s beautiful Jenna, don’t worry
10:47 11:50 12:22 Those neener neener?! Omg lmao!!! Idk why it’s making me die so hard!!!
Julien : * is the most eXquisite lady *
Also Julien : * wears a skirt and manspreads *
HOWLING😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
When you have to teach Julian how to breath
This is one of their most underrated videos tbh
I’d appreciate it if someone exposed the shade of liquid lip she used on him thank you
These fighting moves and shit are killing me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
When you think it can't get any worse, but it does
cursed but I love it
This is one of the funniest videos on the internet 😂 how does he pull off being a bratz that well im weaakk
The hair makes him look like mayhem miller
__          __

He looks like if Tana Mongeau went a little too far
He looks like he’s from white chicks😂😂
“I dont listen to anybody bc I’m a BRAT” kick flip
I'm kinda afraid to fall asleep after this video.
Why does the end result make me think of the movie white chicks😂

Julien singing Uncle Kracker will haunt me for the rest of my life
New horror trailer? I tHiNK sO
#isjulienok

Omg 😮...I’m dying!  His eyes are freaking me out!

Mum can u come pick me up, I’m scared lmao
I'm SCREAMING
Jenna actually smashed this 😂 I’m amazed
he actually looks so good tho
Legend has it that he still looks like a Bratz Doll.
Honestly the eyes aren’t bad at all I’m living for this 😂
tana?
okay but kermits face at 1:23, im dying
Tana Mongeau looks so pretty
I watch this video way too much
cant wait for the horror edits of this one jesus CHRIST
jesus christ. julien looks like he should be in a horror film.
He looks scary!! Lmao!
Bubbles on steriods
I think if I laugh any more I’m going to have a heart attack
“Did it just get cold in here because i’m a brrrrratz “
12:13 and 11:20 for nightmares
"It looks like a tooth" lmao
I’m crying 😂😂
this made me cry with laughter
Next Jenna’s Ratchet Salon: trimming my boyfriend’s eyebrows
14:15 minutes of Jenna getting stressed/ annoyed 😂😭
9:22 if Ronald McDonald was a Drag Queen
11:19 when the teacher assigns weekend homework
Kermet is concernt about your sanity
I feel like Julien always low key feels himself when Jenna does his makeup, nails, or hair and I need that.
I was literally gagging while watching this
It looks terrifying but it’s hilarious
Omg he needs to sing single ladies 😂😂😂😂
I literally died at 5:40 when hes like “oh nooo”
I can’t choose a favorite pun, but 
“Can I go with my Bratz friends to my Bratz Mitzvah?” and “Is it cold in here? ‘Cause I’m a brrrATZ” are beyond iconic.
“I’m a bratz!” 😂🤣😂
get hair extensions that reach all the way to the floor and wear it for a day
Tie your hair into different sized braids and use ends to do your makeup
Julien: how many transitions do you want?
Jenna: Yes.
Coming from someone with freckles, they DO look natural! They're cute!
So basically you’re Henna Marbles now? Lit
Someone got into POWERPOINT TRANSITION SIS 👏🏻
So Julian absolutely edited some of this
I am an Indian and this is very hilarious and entertaining to look people use henna in very different and creative ways lol.
As a person who lives in Rochester NY, I can confirm, the sun does not exist here.
I really think this video could be renamed "making final cut pro x effects work for me" and it would have the same effect tbh
the transitions in the middle of sentences are EVERYTHING
I think she looks hella cute with the freckles so
oh jeez, Jenna went full Aries at 09:39, like damn. As an Aries i'm shocked, that escalated SO fast 😂🤯
ThEy WaNt Me To LoOk LiKe A pRiCkLy PeAr
You right
Wtf is with all the random transitions and effects 😂😂😂😂
JENNA ARE YOU WEARING YOUR ~~~ LEISURE SUIT ~~~ ???
It actually looks really natural HOW
Can we just admire how Jenna our queen is wearing her leisure suit while she attempts to make freckles 😂😭💕
Idk how I missed this but fr..those freckles look natural. You might not think so, but as a natural redhead..they look awesome!! 💗
oh god, they darken overnight. 😂
This is some aries editing and I'm here for it
trypophobia has left the chat




lmao it's a joke don't take it seriously
SHE WAS WEARING HER LEISURE SUIT

Julien should have been doing the freckles for Jenna while she sat and judged
Wait people don't like freckles? Man I am weird then. I find them super attractive on anyone. Especially over the nose or lower face region.
She protecc
She atacc
She be looking like a freckely snacc
All the random transitions really added to the effect of this video
This accentuates your 2007 hot look
I literally hated my freckles for so long and now they’re finally popular to have and I feel ~blessed~
I lived in Rochester New York and then moved to Miami and my hair turned brown lmao.
I thought the crickets were funny editing lilolilol
The chaotic energy when Jenna pulled out the self tanner
Just don’t wear foundation! You don’t even need it tbh 💕
This is what happens when a 5th grader gets a hold of an editing software and I'm living for it.
Gurl did it hurt when you fell from the vending machine? CAUSE YOU LOOKING LIKE A SNACK!
i love how julian just supports you through everything and tells you stuff looks cute even though it doesnt. like at 11:07
I love watching the progression of Jenna getting tired.
“Oh my god, everything is happening really fast.” 

I FELT THAT
Unfortunately, my experience with henna is that you have to keep it on as long as possible…Overnight is Actually best because you won’t pick at it.  Also, the henna will fall off as it dries…you’re not supposed to pick it off! 😊
2:20
Jenna: *puts on one dot
Julien: *OooOhHHHhhHh, that's cute
9:55 Julien: “oh my god”


Jenna: ”what?.”
iMovie: What effects do you want?

Jenna: Yes
She honestly looks adorable with freckles tho
why no one talked about 4:40? A very supportive friend
You should do a video collab and go with someone to get botox. You could even just stand and watch, I just wanna hear julien's commentary
Jenna if they ~*work*~:ლ(́◉◞౪◟◉‵ლ)
Jenna if they don't ~*work*~:ಥ⌣ಥ
Jenna found microsoft powerpoint and her transitions are on POINT
when you actually have freckles but no one notices them and theres barely any
Turn yourself into dr. Phil please
That part about Rochester NY is totally true like I live there now and I feel like I haven’t seen the sun in literal months.
I can I attest (being that I live 40 minutes from Rochester) that NY is a sunless void
Jenna’s thinking if she adds all the effects no one can make horror edits out of this. Think again beeech
Thank you for going to an Indian grocery store Jenna!
I don't tan I just get more freckles

I'm basically a giant freckle
Iv never watched your videos before but this was in my suggestion so I watched it. Suuuuuper cute btw love your natural look
“damn you got freckles, girl! and it only took literally all day and night”
every time she did a transition every time she said “work for me” I DIED
She went from looking 23 to 18 REAL QUICK! with the self tanner
Julian: edits one video
Jenna: watches video you know I don’t use I movie right?
Jenna ur freckles are so symmetrical and close together whyyy
Edit: Oh it's like... nothing nevermind 😂
I'm sorry Jenna I have freckles ✧\(>o<)ﾉ✧.     (┛◉Д◉)┛彡┻━┻ but I love them they cute
They really do make her look younger...not that she looks “old” anyways
Please turn yourself into one of your plants.. I would pay to see that please
DO HENNA EYEBROWS!! it actually works!
U know she watched Antonio Garza before editing this (joke)
Please turn yourself into a box of chocolate for Valentine's Day
Lol I live in Rochester New York and I can indeed confirm it is a sunless void and the weather changes go against all science
Anybody else’s name Hannah so hearing Henna makes you think somebody with a accent is calling your name?
Love that the whole time she’s shamelessly giving other YouTubers promos instead 👌👌
i love how it turned out and i love how supportive julien is of you
I died when Jenna squirted out that tanner and Julien went "Everythings happening so fast"
I am dead  now.
Thanks Jenna
Dalmatian or poppy seed bread = fail
Nothing= overall win
I watch these videos for the same feeling as watching Bob Ross. ♡♡
If I did this then I would look like Morgan freeman
If you shop at morphe, please use the code ADOPTLOVE instead of using beauty influencer codes, all of the proceeds will go to animal shelters!!!!
living for those back to 2010 iMovie transitions
3:51 is the cutest part of the video!!!! 🥰🥰🤠😂Aww
Drinking game: drink every time she says work
omg im from Buffalo, NY!! Never knew you grew up in Rochester.. pretty cool !!
Lots of crickets.... had to pause the video to make sure it was her lol
This reminds me of a PowerPoint I made back in 2005
should have added coffee or pomegranate juice instead!
Also olive, castor, Indian Namla oil, all make henna darker if you apply them after you remove the henna!
I think I’m tripping but I’m rewatching this video after a couple of months and I feel like it’s edited differently, like I don’t remember a lot of these edits. Hello?
You put lemonade on your face so the freckles will stay •-•
The editing of this video is on point
Jenna you are beautiful with freckles!! You did a great job!!
Omg I live in Rochester boyyyy (if you don't mind me asking what town?)
i love near rochester ny and like,all of upstate/wny is a sunless void from like november to may
Jenna looks so pretty without makeup.💕💕
J E N N A M A R B L E S B E I N G C R A Z Y O N C E A G A I N❤
the powerpoint transitions are lit
I seriously think Jenna should voice an animated character.
I have freckles and the end result looks so natural! I think because you used 3 different products with varying process time of each that the end result is so natural looking. Love it!
Oh my god I live in Rochester NY yeah you are right its not sunny that much but today March 9 it’s so sunny ☀️
Dear god I got sea sick with the camera work/editing
I always have loved my freckels, I couldn't imagine myself without them.
Love the things that make you unique
You should dye your hair with Arctic Fox VEGAN & CRUELTY FREE hair dye( without bleaching your hair first) 

So get your man out the house and dye your your hair like the smart, independent wOmEn you aRe
Just watched a 5 minute crafts before and henna freckles was actually in the video. 

NOTE TO SELF: doesn’t work. don’t do this.
Some people I'm listening to ocean waves while sleeping me I'm gonna listen to Jenna making freckles
I think we ALL have to say goodbye to Henna Marbles
When u said Rochester and York I thought u meant uk 🙈😂 x
Thank you for making videos Jenna!! You’re awesome and I love you!!
The freckles totally worked! You look so cute, I think the point of the freckles is so that you don’t have to wear face make up. You pull it off girl!
“sunless void like rochester ny” OH MY GOD SO ACCURATE AHAH
living for the new HENNA marbles
BTW PLEASE NOTICE YOUR FELLOW ROCHESTERIAN PERSON😂😂😂
I SEE YOUR SKIN IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER EVERY VIDEO! WHAT IS YOUR SECRET?! Sorry for yelling, but I MEAN come onnnnnn! You look good girl!
JENNA U DIDNT GET GOOD QUALITY HENNA!!! OF COURSE IT DIDNT OXIDIZE PROPERLY CUZ IT WAS NO GOOD!!!!!

This actually is the 1st video I've seen of yours and immediately subscribed😂
The editing on this video will forever be my favorite
They look great! Haha you and Julien are hilarious
1:06 i live in the sunless void that is rochester, ny, and it kills me every day
Only 3 minutes in and oH BOY THE EDITING IN THIS VIDEO IS EXQUISITE
I love his when u first started u did them all in the same vertical line😂😂😂
I watch you with my mom while we are doing crafts
I’ve honestly never understood the appeal of freckles?? Like they aren’t bad or anything, but they also aren’t any more attractive than any other type of skin ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Yo she lived in ROCHESTER???? Come home sis come HOOOOOME😂😱
Jenna marbles discovering special effects editing in 2019
Ten minutes in 
"WHERE'S THE TOO MUCH GENE- oh fake tan cool"

She basically made lemonade and put it on her face😂
“Did you just heckle my freckles” 😂
I love the transitions every time she says "work for me"
12:13 hit home 😂
I didn't even know you were from Rochester I'm from buffalo and our power has been out for 12 hours and I've been watching your videos🤣
Transform yourself into Dr Phil
The transitions used in this left me WEAK
Wait. You lived in ROCHESTER?? <3
Когда перешла с канала Камеди Стор...
Wait she lived in Rochester NY? Cool I live like 2 hours away from there
when you live in a sunless void that is Rochester, New York
PREACH!
It seems like Jenna just found out how to use all the effects in her editing software
I liked just for Henna Marbles.
Jenna- JENNA you're doing freckles not Dalmatian spots!!
k it looks super natural!!! I LOVE THEM YOURE SO CUUUUUTE <3 <3 <3
shoulda used just for men 😂
also, can i just say, the editing was exquisite
Me: having a good time
Jenna: Rochester NY is a sunless void
Me: looks outside at the shit Rochester weather 
Me: :(
@JennaMarbles

it's funny that you call yourself old, it was at this moment that my mother came to me and asked what kind of young lady you had here. (sorry for grammar, I'm from Russia)
HENNA FOR JENNA 
JUST FOR MEN AND JENNA
"night time DAY TIME night time DAY TIME night time DAY TIME" I want to play some night time DAY TIME! I love your freckles!
Shane's out there giving us 1 hour conspiracy contents, and here's Jenna


SERVING US THE CONTENT WE DESERVE IN HER LEISURE SUIT
The transitions of the video remind me when I first discovered windows PowerPoint when I was 8
Hahaha currently dealing with the struggle of Rochester NY's weather🤦
“OooooooOohhhhh my God” 
“whAT”
“Everything is happening so FaSt!”
the only girl Ive seen that made actual natural looking freckles. they look VERY natural!!
the video effects are screaming "im an 8 year old who just got iMovie" and it is WORKING
~*WORK*~
omg Naomi war in diesem Video uhhh
You kinda look cute with the freckles (=^w^)
Is anybody able to Nancy Drew that “tiny silicone sponge” she used at 10:05 ?
"DID YOU JUST HECKLE MY FRECKLES"

I love that when julien called her a freckled snack and she just showed a pic of a spiky pare I’m am literally dying lmfao
Henna Marbles!  They look cute, but the "beauty" spot did not work for the hookers in the Hogarth print, and has never worked for anybody else since!
i actually really love them and think they look super natural ☀️ she’s super pretty :))
YOU'RE FROM ROCHESTER?!?!? I'M FROM BUFFALO. Dasss crazyyy
When you said, "I love it, but this is stupid"... I felt that.
CDC may drop by for the smallpox outbreak
“They’re in a library, they’re being quiet”😂
idk who you should listen to but it's probably not beauty gurus bc they don't know what tf they're talking about
“We’ve gotta say goodbye to Henna Marbles”


Holy CoW YALL THIS IS THE MOST LIKES I GOT I LOVE YOu aLL
You should have used the just for men😂😂😂
I’m sad 99% of the time. Thanks for posting these videos. I love watching 😊❤️
Omg Jenna lives in Rochester NY? I live like an hour away from there
"they're in a library, they're being quiet"
Print out  hate comments and make a dress out of it !!!!
Hello!I' m Ira and I from Russia.I like you video.
Ты очень крутая!!!!
She actually did amazing on this, was not a fail
Damn you got freckles and it literally took all day and night” 😂😂😂😂😂
I got on YouTube to search “how to change a car radio”... thanks Jenna for your much more entertaining video that has now distracted me from my task!
Am I watching a power point presentation
HELPPPPPPPENNNA


What is the songggg in the background !!!!

Also the henna does come out of the hair because my mom dyes her hair with it
I think if I tried this it would just look like I was walking down a road and a car went over dog poop and splashed it in my face. Love you tho cause you slay everything!!!❤️

Well I have beauty Marc's on both sides of my face
Omg she's wearing her leisure suit

Whoever edited this had way too much fun 😂
I literally did the turmeric face mask last night 😂
I was looking like a damn Simpson 😂
“Oooh Get eeem.”

“Thank yew.”

Shout out from the sunless void.

At least we got garbage plates.
If you start from the begging, scroll through the video. You can notice it getting darker in the background. 😂
im thinking jenna got a new editing app
HOLY CRAP THIS WORKED SO NICELY!!! YOU SO PRETTY!
"Sunless void like Rochester, New York." 
Jenna, I go to school in Syracuse.
GURL I FEEL YOU
i used Just For Men on my fave for fake freckles and it worked!!!
How was I not following you before?? Maybe that was on my old account. Either way, love ya 😅💛
Can you give yourself eyebrows that go the opposite way
I think this actually looks AMAZING on you !!!
Can I just say, your eyebrows look so lovely in this vid.
Turn yourself into dr phiiillllll 😂 ❤️
you can probably use the jagged/uneven sponge and dab it all over your face with a darker foundation or you can probably get a toothbrush and flick it across your face with darker foundation.
Jenna, they're gunna get darker. You added 4 layers.   Jenna call 911
Omg you look older... lol makes sense because i havent watched your videos in almost 7 years ha
But those look SO REAL tho??? Omg. Might have to try this at some point lmao
Henna nds to be on ur skin much much longer hunxxxx
This kind of triggered my trypophobia 💀
I mean she made it work for her
Okay so I just impulsively bought henna sooooo watch me do this in a week tbh
Oof I'm still stuck in Rochester. Help
Heyoo , I am from Schenectady (Albany area). I knew your accent sounded familiar! xoxo
Did this trigger anybody else’s tryphobia?
this was a great powerpoint presentation, love the effects, I'd give you an a+
There is no sexual Wednesday intro anymore. It is startling
I love your freckles!!!💜💜💜💜
I loved the natural henna look!!! Putting some on your chin would have been a prime move.
3:13 RIGHT as I get a pop up for a new Shane Dawson video. =^=;;;
Just me or she looks really young in this video? :)
6:43 fun fact some people can’t dye their hair after using Hana on it for almost 3 years

( SOME it just wouldn’t stay or last you’ll just have hair damage if you tried)
I love the final look. it looks so natural. even though it took forever  for you to do, and you were delirious by the end. thanks for the effort.
Freckles are just sun and skin damage, they aren’t good but are cute
12:54 not to mention it took something jenna ALREADY HAD lol
Did you...heckle my freckle 🤣
I have a beauty mark by my eye and got made fun of for having it literally all my life and it's weird seeing that people draw then on their faces  ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ (´-﹏-`；)
By the very end, with all the different techniques resulting in different shapes, sizes, and opacities, they look so fucking real 😍

It may have taken all damned day, but you look good B!  😂💕
I got natural freckles and I LOVE THEM!!!!!
This gave my skin so much anxiety... ily guys so much 😭😭😭
build a giant fort with blankets and pillows like we did when we were kids
I feel like you really really need to do the Pippi Longstocking look

I am being serious. It MUST be done. Don't screw with me. I will put pigtails on your dog. :P
This is the video that got me subscribed to you again. You were my og favourite. You’ve made me obsessed again, I fucking love your niche!
After 9:30, it started to get real chaotic. I was starting to get a little scared lmao

Also,  "Henna Marbles"... Julien...
You let henna flake off on their own.. love your videos 😊💕
Can you put hair extensions on your nails
The editing is superb
the editing in this video is PERFECT
The snecc that freckles back
Jen-nuh
I love how the tanning stuff gave you freckles.
I’m here for Julien’s support
I love how she’s casually wearing the LEISURE SUIT in this video
I have freckles BUT I NEVER THOUGHT LIKE EVERYONE HATED THEM
Also I learned a valuable lesson: Henna actually causes a tan line. So that would be counterproductive in the long run as they fade. 😬
Idk why, but the whole time, i was waiting for Julien to say "Henna Montana"
The transitions look like my 6th grade powerpoint I spent so long trying to impress the teacher by
The montage of all the Jenna fukcs herself up moments was GOLD
This video gave me life today
Wait... what would happen if you used henna as contour, YA WOULDNT EVEN NEED CONTOUR WHEN GETTING READY. Omg Jenna please do that, it would look ExQuiSiTe 😂
Rochester update: the sky keeps pranking us making us think that spring is gonna come, but then it snows
Did Julien edit this video? It’s very Aries with the effects lol
I tested henna freckles on my hand and left them on for ten minutes and they didn’t show up so I gave up and the next day I looked at my hand and they had developed. They look really natural so I put them on my face and nothing has shown up yet so let’s see what happens tomorrow.

Edit- nothing showed up so I tried again with different henna and I now have natural freckles!
I like the random edits she puts at random moments 😂💙
JENNNNNNA. YOU LOOK YOUNG, AND BEAUTIFUL  GIRL ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm gonna make it editing app insert WORK for me
Wait whhaaaat Jenna ARE YOU FROM ROCHESTER?! We are the same age and I’m from Henrietta how do we not KNOW EACH OTHER I mean obviously. It’s a large area. That’s how.

Edited to add: I’m dreaming of vacation “placeholder freckles” now ty
It's impractical but you look hella good with em.
Lots of crazy freckles I always thought we were similar  and now I'm thinking g yes we are both regular😂😂😂
Take a shot every time she says 
Fake
Freckle
Work
Did Jenna just find out about video transition effects?
jenna marbles....QUEEN of camp. have no idea why you weren't invited to the met gala this year. absolutely disrespectful of them.
GIIIIRL I feel your pain I live in the sunless void ROCHESTER NY don't feel any shame going out in the sun you suffered here long enough lol
My lived in Rochester New York to
I thought when u said henna freckles u were doing word play on your name cause j in spanish is h 😂😂😂😂
I wanna see her wake up tomorrow and that henna be DARK
I got a natural beauty mark. I wish they were still cool
Watching you scratch the henna off was so cringeeee !! Damaging your skin so bad lol
Rochestet is my home town and all you said about it is painfully correct
i really want to know if one of their neighbors heard her yell “YOU DIDNT BUY ANYTHING. I BOUGHT THE HENNA.” at the crickets.
the transitions on this video sent me into another dimension
DAMMIT JENNA U GOT 19.... MILLION SUBSCRIBERS
Rochester New York IS Sunless and cruel, take it from me my dude
This is my first time seeing you without makeup. Gorgeous!
I have a trick to get really nice looking freckles. It worked for me, trust me. 


Go outside and sunburn your face. Bam. Freckles
henna marbles....JULIEN you DID NOT😂
youre so pretty omg and the freckles turned out really nice!
Me too! I had the cutest freckles when I was young! Oh, The Glory Days!
The editing is everything 😭👏🏻
I love how many people this doesn't work at all for. Henna doesn't work on oily surfaces guys. xD
HOW DOES EVERY DISASTROUS PROCESS ALWAYS LOOK GOOD ON YOU
This video should be called “Jenna Marbles if she edited like Antonio garza”
The highest of quality content. Well done.
Interesting, maybe it depends on your skin which works better. Maybe try henna overnight. Looks great! Nice video! You’re funny and relatable! 😉😊 thanks for your videos
you'd look so good with just a natural look that doesn't cover the freckles like mascara or something
The editing was going crazy 😂
I love the random effects and transitions in this video😂
Oh god the turmeric mask.....it’s so nice to know that I wasn’t the only one to turn into a Simpson character.
Btw I really liked the freckles after the second round of henna, they looked really pretty 😍
Julien: Omg things are happening Wayy too fast lmao
You should try doing Drag King looks (makeup, clothes, etc.) another cool video would be if Julian did Drag Queen makeup
Julien, is the freaking cutest to Jenna. 
Jenna puts one dot on her face
Julien "OOOOOOOo, thats cute"
Jennas too much gene really came out while she was editing and I love it
Omg the montage of footage of you doing your hair/trying diff looks killed me
You were right for moving away from Rochester NY... it sucks here😂😂😂and it’s to damn cold
The accuracy of the “sunless void” of Rochester is too accurate my god I died
Jenna subconsciously putting her freckles in rows is me af lol
I would like to know if the henna freckles got darker? My henna tattoos usually takes 48 hours to get the darkest color. 
And would also be awesome to see you do henna tattoos!
“LitERalLy all day AND night”
"I love it but this is stupid" me 100% when I do fake freckles with my makeup
Idk why, but I feel like if someone had trypophobia they would be dying rn
Jenna could make a video about literally anything, She could make a video about «Where the english parliament members buy their socks»  and I would still be entertained.
Jenna: Don't tan your skin
Me: Automatically wants to tan my skin
I’m actually in pain from laughing so hard :)))
Girl- that is sooo beautiful!! Who says you're not artistic!!
I was today years old when i found out you get freckles because of the sun or something in that area. Because when I was small I was told that you get freckles when you eat pork. Also none of my family eats pork. It all makes sense now...... -.- 🤯
At this point you should give Julien a mic in the background.
♥  i always used to wish when I was younger that I could have freckles, I always made friends with the kids with them and now I have a boyfriend with freckles and I LOVE it 😂
Girrrrl you don't need no makeup. Damn🙈
OMG U LIVED IN ROCHESTER NY!!! I LIVE THERE AND LOOK LIKE THE SPACES IN BETWEEN THESE VERRY OBNOXIOUS WORDS LOL love your vids
Too much gene took over while editing.
Achievement unlocked 

henna marbles

Edit: thx so much for the likes ❤
crickets have entered the chat
The henna gets darker OVER TIME. Be patient maybe
Problem Solved: GIve Julien Fake Freckles Friday
Jenna: And this one is extra dark! Sometimes it comes out G R E E N 
Julien: concerned oh my god 
Jenna: W H A T
Love that shes wearing her leisure suit
Omg the lil video of Naomi and her freckle fail hahaha 🤭👾😂
Are you a plant? How do you just grow freckles and have seasonal freckles I want that superpower lmao
I tried your idea to use self-tanner and it didn't work with the one I bought... Will you share the brand you used please? ❤️
"I wanna look like one of those cute outside people" same jenna...same...
She extra in the edits
I think moto moto likes uuuu
I love the video, I just want to ask what is going on with the focus?? I'm having a hard time with that
Ayeee I’m from rochesterrrr nyyyy 🥰
New viewer, came cdrom Brad mono mondo reviewing hot hair extension video. Loved you after the eyebrow, just for men. Uou two are hilarious.
Please make a cake shaped like cermit!!
chaotic energy just radiates from this video
i have a freckle on my lip
"IT LITERALLY TOOK ALL DAY....AND NIGHT"
I live in Rochester NY and I have the same type of freckles as Jenna 🤣
Jenna, are you having fun with the edits on this video? ahaha
Your freckles ACtu-ally look great.
11:46 
Julien: I think it's time to say goodbye to Henna Marbles.
Jenna:......
Jenna: Am I a joke to you?
Why is there a subtle heartbeat during that compilation?
Oh n the update of if it darkened???😱😱😱😱in dying  I have to know😂😂😂
I love that Jenna wore her leisure suit for this. She out here makin leisure freckles
Back after 7 years. What happened to jenna marbles in football gear?
the end result looks super cute and super natural!
SOME GIRL WHIT FRECKELS CAME AND TOOK OVER THE VIDEO :o JENNA WHO WAS IT :O
You need to wait 6 or 10 hours. They should come or good
The PowerPoint slides are killing me omg 😂😂😂
freaking love this woman!
Wearing your leisure suit 💗🤗
I absolutely love the self tanner freckles!!!
Well I just dyed my skin orange after trying this:)
Julien: how are you gonna edit the video 
Jenna: yes
О нет, так непривычно слышать женский голос у Дженны🤣
i wish i counted how many times she said “i’m gonna make fake freckles work for me” 😂😂😂
That leisure suit tho 😂
I’m honestly convinced that this is how garrett watts edits his videos asksksk
You look so tall in this video
The subtle yet highly random transitions have me crying 💀💀💀 but also those freckles make you look like the protagonist for a book about a businessman who goes to the country searching for purpose and finds a small town country gal AKA “Self Tanna Henna Jenna”
The editing in this video was so cute 😆
Is every time you say work do you do a random thing while you were editing
~*WORK*~
Put green freckles on your face and use it as a green screen
I have freckles and I love them. I was actually born with them
You have to wait for a day to show colour. Henna works after absorbing body heat
Julian: How long you gonna let them sit? 
Jenna: Idk 2 hours maybe
Absolutely  love the final look. You really do look amazing at the end, which is wonderful. The first henna test though had me worried, because it  made you look like a trypophobics nightmare. You totally saved it though!!
okay but they look so cute tho
Those actually look SUPER good! Hahah
Julien: it's time to say goodbye to henna marbles Jenna:
Julien: what did I say
“I love it but this is stupid”...me anytime I try to be trendy. (Ends up wearing a sweatshirt and not in a cute way).
Just use light brown pencil eyeliner
EDIT: Btw nice leisure suit Jenna
Why does Kermit always look like he  has seen the thing from bird box
The foundation that stays on forever
Nice transitions, they’re cool!
😂😂 I thought you were supposed to leave the henna fall for itself for it to work
drunk game: every time she says freckles or work for me you have to drink.
The special effects in this video really 👌 worked 👌 for👌 me 👌
You should dye youre hair with just for men
My cousin used her brow pencil to draw freckles on me and it’s worked really well
OMG it would be a dream come true to meet Kermit! He is so funny and as such a personality and is attracted to soap. Really makes me laugh so hard when he is being silly
True I just like to see you fail 🤣
Honestly the end result was super cute and natural looking
I did it! With mehendi (indian) henna)) I washed my face, put on almond oil, then lemon juice the same. Then made "freckles" and waited for 20min and scrached them off. And dots! They should be bigger to work on skin and that's all)) yeah, it is lighter exactly after scratching, but the day after it is amazing😳😍
I freckle from driving on a sunny day...I’m not an outside person i just freckle a lot
"They want me to look like a prickly pear"
-Jenna 2019
you hair looks nice just brown  tbh. even tho i like seeing it ruined it looks good!
my powerpoint presentations from 4th grade are shook
im from rochester ny too :))
Dude. Rochester!? Batavia... Lol always thought you were a Jersey girl lol
"You're not a sad freckled clown. You're a cute freckled clown".
If this man is not a goal, I don't know what he is
You look like such a snacc in this video
As someone who lives near Rochester. I can confirm. Freckles are rare
Oooooooooh your using Hanna 
(I’m Pakistani so I kind of overreacted)
Edit: my mom dyes her hair with Hanna A Lot and she looks so beautiful and also a lot of her friends dyed their hair with Hanna it’s also beautiful!!!!!you really should dye it!!!!! !!!!!!
P.S you have to let the Hanna sit so it could get it’s color
Странно смотреть тебя и слышать женский голос😄
Привет из России
Flawless queen of makeup and editing
2:06 what do ya think just killed me oh my god
9:28 Kermit turning around to see who she yelling at
This is triggering my tripophobia :P
don't know why the editing in this video annoyed me lol but still great content
When Jenna discovers the other effects on moviemaker
Love some paint on sun damage 😂
the editing on this video is legit so good please do more like this
YEAH ROCHESTER TAG
"Henna Marbles" lmaooo
Omg I live really close to Rochester I live in horseheads ny and it's the same deal
@jenna You should have left the henna on for more time. :|
Should’ve just used JUST FOR MEN (and Jenna) lmao
At least for me whenever I do henna it takes about 4-6 hours to dry so...
When you learn how to use a new transition...
You look so cute with freckles! I love freckles! My husband and my kids have freckles and I just think they're adorable! ❤️
I live in rockchester and it has like zero sun
I feel the weather shit man I live in buffalo ny😬😬
Aahh you look so cute and very young. Like a teenage girl
“They want me to look like a prickly pear”
*looks at my acne* ...
But people who have naturally freckles and put on make up, they are gone too 😂
High key look super cute Jenna! I know it took you forever but I want fake freckles now 💞💞
Her eyebrows are so HUGE (for Jenna)! LOL
Jenna is for sure my soul animal. I subbed 4 years ago watched every video since no regrets lol. Also I love my freckles too when I have them tf. I think freckles are cute af
reupload because the freckles were too powerful
I have natural freckles but people don't notice em' anyway
I have freckles. Love them.
Yeah ok this is why I subscribed
Lmao 😂 The freckles looks so good
I can't believe Jenna's too much gene spread to the editing
These edits are killing me 😂
I have natural freckles wich I love, but I also have red skin on my face... So I wear foundation makeup, and when it's enough to cover the red, it also covers my freckles :(
the henna I use doesn’t take HOURS to like have a tint it just takes like 10-15 min
Sis was really not about to give up...
The editing on this video 😂 I love it! ❤️
You can have my freckles.
She’s so pretty naturally and I’m so jealous
I have freckles and I love them, but they're always the last thing anyone notices about me. I wish mine were more vibrant/ visible.Sadly I no longer go outside.
This turned out so go tho😂
How about... 100 layers of henna freckles ?
Lol Just looks like a rash 😂
just watched some of jennas old videdos and WOW please do a reaction to some of your very first ones! please!
AAAHH I LIVE NEXT TO ROCHESTER
H E N N A  M A R B L E S
Henna Marbles
Not my first video.  But my second.   Just came from james video.... conclusion.. love you... wish I found you 10 years ago.  
Also love love love the freckles, my 9 year old actually used washable marker yesterday to give herself freckles :) she looked amazing.
I thought I would just say....I have a freckle on my lip 😂😂
I have Trypophobia, so it was hard to watch this video (LIKE A LOT) but I did because you are funny and I love you <3
‘im gonna make fake freckles work for me’ (said it like 100 times its mad) 😭😂
sis is stepping up the EDITING !!!
As an indian will give u some tips:
Apply mustard oil
Lemon juice
No water contact for couple hrs. Best left overnight
Sit in heated area or apply steam as heat increases color transfer.
Avoid soap for a day
Also while removing dont scratch it off. Use oil.
And NO WATER
GIIIIRIRRRRLLLLLLL THOSE TRANSITIONNSSSSS
This was my first marbles video. Now I know to use tanner instead of henna
exercise where ??
Watching from Rochester NY. We’re in the void of winter. Does the sun still exist or is it just a hoax?
anyone else notice that jenna has really STEPPED UP her editing game??!
This editing is Fire™
wait does she live in rhochester ny????i live a hour away from rhochester!!
You're supposed to leave henna on until it flakes off naturally for maximum color. The longer it stays moist and stays on, the darker the color is going to be.
IT HONESTLY LOOKS SO GOOD
Screams: brown eyeliner!!!!!!!! I use those for my fake freckles.
Dude I have freckles and HATE them
Jenna: it's been a day
Me: and a night
Why do I keep coming back to this video?
Can you make a wig made out of pasta? Like you can get a bald cap and make some homemade  pasta and somehow glue the pasta to the bald cap idk
I love the freckles on u
~*Henna*~ Marbles
Whenever I get henna they usually tell me to wash it off and not pick it off
For a second I thought my screen had freckles.
Can we just appreciate Jenna going to an Indian shop and not getting the stuff off eBay 💖💖
Please do actual henna art. Please
Try to do one of James Charles makeup designs do it again ❤️❤️
Omg Jenna u are a queen. But I was remembering when u shaved ur eyebrows and I looked at ur eyebrows and I realized they look like tampons.
It’s henna marbles now
so beautiful goddamn
Your hair looks so nice!
HEY prickly pears are hella good!!!!
Im late at but I got a henna tattoo at the Strawberry Festival last year (its a fair that Florida has every March) and they told me to keep it on for 4 hours then wash it, I kept it for more like 5 and it stayed for like 2 or 3 weeks
When you realize she's rehydrating with Lemonade lol
What if the henna was frosting?
Henna don't permanently dye your hair.
aw your little Naomi Jon moment at the beginning
At the very beginning of the video you’re giving me strong Soirse Ronan vibes
You've heard of Jessica Messica, now get ready for

Jenna Henna
"We made a little batch of sugar and lemon and water" literally lemonade 😂
i live in rochester ny wow i keep forgetting she’s from here
It looks like someone just STABS little holes in your skin ahhhh tryophoiba be warned!
Me living in rochester new york rn 1:05
ok but who edited this I’m looking to hire
The way Jenna makes cry face, it reminds me Kermit's face(12:58)😂😍
Love them !!
can someone timestamp when she fails please
The "beauty mark" made me feel good.. I have a mole on my chin and have always been told it's a "beauty mark". It's not, but I felt good. I had no idea the "beauty marks" artifical markings were a thing.. So, thanks for making me feel good.
I personally like you with fake freckles. Very cute.
I already have real freckles
Omg she looked really cute with freckles and she knew that and he was like woah and she was like blush... what a cute fucking video man 😩❤️❤️ ugh
u r supposed 2 wear henna until it falls off not for a couple hrs
Jenna: Don't tan your skin
Also Jenna: pulls out the darkest self tanner I've ever seen
this is how i used to edit my powerpoints for class presentations when i was 12 and i love it
wait, they turned out so good though
Wait what the frick I didn’t know she made this video I’m-
Why do people go out of their way to dislike an innocent video like this? I just don’t understand what goes through your head
The thumbnail disturbs me🤮
i love the random transitions throughout the video hashtag top tier editing
You look so cute tho at the end 😄
Gurl how much foundation are you using that you’re covering all that up?
welcome to jenna marbles just discovered imovie transitions



im here for it.
Trick is to just do your cheeks and don't bricklay a pattern like you did on your nose
Jenna: “....and you want me to walk around looking like...” “what’s somethin...”
Julien: “a freckled snack”
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
But I feel like if you gave yourself really dark henna dot freckles, then when you put makeup over it they'd still be kinda visible and it would WORK lol
All of this frustration should be cancelled out BECAUSE OF THE LEISURE SUIT
The freckles came out super cutethey look natural too I'm glad the self tanner worked better but yea dude henna takes forever to show up because it's natural
Those random effects what the hell  beeshhh, 😂😂😂😂
13:22 the fake tan freckles actually look pretty legit
tf is up with the editing jenna LOL
I have freckles and love them. My mom lived in California and was bullied relentlessly for freckles and she hates them and then she moved to Oklahoma and everyone compliments me and her on our beautiful freckles and now she's not so self conscious
If Sharpie did make a foundation to cover up Sharpie then surely it would be called Blurrie??? Right???
Tan ur face w the darkest tanner ever
11:47 “i think we should all say bye to henna marbles” actual crickets in the background
who’s here from rochester being inspired by jenna ? <3
Awkward cause I like in Rochester ny and I feel attacked
I do fake freckles in the spring/summer using the elf eyebrow pomade/mousse/whatever it's called! I do my makeup as usual, then dot the freckles on with the tip of a bobby pin. I let them dry, then press on them a bit/pick them off. I like how it looks, especially if you brush a tiiiinyyy bit of bronzer over where they are the most concentrated
I love how Julien just supports Jenna at everything. Even if he thinks it might be stupid
I’ve entered a Jenna marbles K hole haven’t stopped watching for days now Lmfao
Idk what henna you bought or where you got it but that's really odd that it took hours. I had an Iraqi friend who go hella straight from the middle east. It took like 20 min and showed up and was quite dark.
Hey jenna yor face is amaizing without make up!
You just let it dry
goodbye jenna marbles





hello henna marbles
It gets dark you can't see it but it will get darker.
i’m from rochester ny!!!! i think you were from victor right??
They look really natural imho. You look younger and well hydrated!
I get the appeal! I have freckles, there the BEST!!! I make them work for me, and I LOVE it.
How pretty is she with zero makeup on, though? Absolutely gorgeous, right?!?
its so weird (and also cool) seeing you doing a “beauty mark” bc i have one and i dont like it :(
Dye your hair with henna please
Jenna nooooo you look the picture age for a ~32 year old lady~
never have i felt more blessed to be born with freckles, thanks jenna! lol
Little did she know she ended up in Shane’s video 😂
Henna is suppose to sit on the skin until it falls off or for at least 24 hours. Then it oxidizes and eventually darkens more.
omg u look so pretty in the thumbnail!!!!!!
I found out i had tryphobia today
Oh shes jen marbles omg i didn't know wow
I feel like I’m watching a middle school presentation with this editing lmao
0:25 NAOMI JOOOOOOON
when i was 3 i would always try to pick my freckles off in my moms bedroom mirror because i thought it was dirt. lmao?
You leave it on till it falls off itself and it darkens over time
i use instant dust coffee with a little of water and either poke them my hand with little thingy, or tooth brush
Shave off your eyebrows again and draw them back on with henna
Im happy to have naturally a lot of freckles!
Yay for Rochester, NY where the sun comes out twice a year 😂
What. Is. With, These. Edits. :D
That's actually adorable
I love Jenna’s editing, it looks like a middle schooler experimenting with imovie
Girl you LEISURING
Why were there random transitions in the video?
Glad I have natural freckles. I love each and everyone of em.
Idrk who editied this but I love you
Actually it looks neutral and awesome
I feel like her henna freckles are going to oxidize and shes just going to be one big freckle tomorrow
I 👏🏻 love 👏🏻 the 👏🏻 editing 👏🏻
I’m pretty sure that the longer you leave it on, the darker it comes off.  Also, if you leave it on for a long time, it will last for like a month 😂 😂 😂
I was made fun of constantly for about 20+ years because I am covered in freckles all over. It sucked, and now I just feel like I was born in the wrong time because people are tattooing them on now 😂 I’m glad people are embracing it now though 😊
I love you so much! 💖❤️
who let julien edit this😭
I love her natural look way more than her look from a couple years ago
i'm @ 9:36 and they look good!
you look so cute jenna!
When I watched her pore all that out I was like so are we just tanning your whole body now plus Julian
Please make a beard of fake nails.
As someone who NEVER wears face makeup thanks for showing me how I’m gonna be a freckled SNACC
Love the new editing! And usually the way people mess up is that the freckles get super dark and then here's Jenna somehow making it just not work at all. Not even a little bit
NOAMI JON! <3
what is this editing? XD
You and Julien should try to paint a portrait of each other omff
They honestly look really cute and natural it is a win this was typed before 10 minutes but i'm here for potential disaster lol
Rochester is awful for weather. We could have a foot of snow, and a hot summer day in a couple days. We call it rottenchester
We need another hair video from you .
Idk what it is, but I love it when Americans says sugar
This is beside the point of the video but YOU LOOK SO CUTE WITHOUT MAKEUP
High key your hair and eyebrows look really good in this video
i live in rochester 😂
I loved the self Tanner freckles. They looked natural and super cute! I'd go out with no makeup on.
conclusion looks cute you look pretty word
Girl you make it work! You look so good without makeup 😊💕👍🏽
Im watching this because of Naomi
0:25 Naomi entered the chat
Ouch!!! Watching you scrape the henna ink off your skin is like hearing metal scratch on a chalkboard!!! Stop it!!! Your skin is pretty flawless! No bumps or breakouts. The internet is going to ruin your skin! Also who advised to use lemon sugar water as a rehydrate? Lemon has a lightening effect.
Did you just heckle... my freckles??!? 🤣👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Mehandi on face
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
Supposed to leave the henna on for as long as possible.
"I wanna look like one of the cute outside people... who goes outside."
A true inspiration-leader
I love how peaceful all her videos feel, even when they're meant to be chaotic they're still some how hella peaceful.
W O R K
Either give yourself an at h o m e s p a 
Or 
Wear extentions that hit the floor and mess with it
People with natural freckles: laughs in the distance
Making Fake Freckles ~*Work*~ For Me (GONE EMOTIONAL)
4:19 I love the behind the scenes of Mars needs moms
I live in a sunless void called Canada 😫😭 #frecklesarewaitingforspring
Those edits tho!
3:49-3:57 😂😂😂 omg lmao
JENNA! YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR MOTHER IN A LEISURE SUIT AND MAKE HER FAVORITE MEAL FOR HER!
I loved your blonde hair!!!! Go blonde ❤️❤️
somehow the thought comes to mind that you had a lot of fun editing this video
honestly i have natural freckles and theyre only a TINY bit darker than the henna ones jenna had!!! i dont think its a half bad idea! some people have lighter freckles than others so they dont have to be like. super dark and loud!
Some ants thought her face was a picnic
The edits in this video is me editing my middle school PowerPoint presentations for every bullet point and slide
You kinda act like sssniper wolf
You look so proud of your self : ) 🙂
Its funny because this was my first video of you and I think they look great and also you look great without make up!! So I loved it! :)
i see a ~*lEiSuRe*~ suit
I need Jenna to contribute to that "I turned myself into a Bratz doll" trend
the ~*EDITING*~
Love all the PowerPoint transitions
Oh goodness, Jenna looks so cute! 😆 As someone with a little darker skin tone, I find it so cute and beautiful when you get tinges of red on the face and limbs💜
Thanks for buying it at an Indian store and supporting the businesses that need it! Thanks Jenna you’re great as always
Looked like Kermit got diarrhea and you got a face load.
Rochester is actually the most sunless void in the world i swear
i used to live in rochester ny and i have natural freckles and everyone was so jealous of me but i was so embarrassed bc i looked so weird
It actually looks SO natural!
OH NO THOSE HENNA FRECKLES ARE GONNA BE REAL DARK THE NEXT DAY, SHES GONNA BE REAL BROWN
What r these editing skills 😶😶😶
jenna used henna (*_*;)
You guys need to copyright sharpie foundation that covers up sharpie before they do. That's a sick idea.
Так не привычно слышать твой голос женским ,а не муржским 😂
us: lemonade
jenna, an intellectual: "a little mixture of lemon and sugar and water to rehydrate"
I’m very insecure about my freckles...
When she said she was going to leave them to sit for two hours I almost screamed
I think it looks super cute
Perks of being a redhead for freckles coming in; even with sunscreen you freckle up everywhere
jenna: making one dot on her face
julien: oooh that's cute
we all need man like this
0:38 Well when your freckles aren’t “seasonal” and you grew up getting bullied because of them it can be hard to view them as anything other than a flaw. 🙃
Had freckles when I was young but now they're kind off gone. Im really missing them :/
Henna darkens over time
Jenna doesn't even need make up. Like boo you're skin is flawless
A message to Jenna, 

You’ve made freckles wOrK for you, beech

Sincerely, 
Lizzie 

P.S. Big mood
jenna: can you edit my video for me? nothing to crazy please. 
julian: sure........ 😏
3:57 AWWW❤️
This is mij first video I've seen from u
Naomi jon🤤☝🏻
that montage of jenna's insanity... golden
Lol the crickets
I have both a beuaty mark and freckles 👌✌
You need to keep it for overnight, so that you get that brown colour. And that's what we do in India
Jenna try Freck. Then you can do your makeup and put them on after 😊 it definitely takes less than all and all night 😂
Take your skill to the next level and paint a beautiful picture on Julien's back with paint brushes and self Tanner
CUT SOME BANGS
Do drunk math school
The freckles are too dark and look like black dots all over her face. I don’t know why that bothers be so god damn much 😭😭
I actually think layering the different colored/sized freckles made it look really natural!!! Not a complete waste of time!
It’s so funny to me that it’s a trend to have freckles when I was made fun of for having so many freckles growing up. Like what? 😂
Wait, is she in the leisure suit? 
I can’t tell if she’s in the leisure suit
Honestly 3:56 is so hot🥵😂
As a shaved head, do something(s) weird and then shave it 🥚 #egghead
this was in my makeup recommended section u a beauty guru jenna
These slide transitions randomly placed in your video are KILLING ME 😂😂😂
Why am I getting some leopard vibes?
She's so humble. I love it
Say no to fake freckles.... I love freckles! I can tell the difference lmao.
Somehow, I manage to get freckles everywhere except my face
at 13:41  these actually LOOK SO REAL!
I have freckles and I love them since they are in my cheeks and nose and my cheeks are usually red so I look like a cartoon character 😂
i actually have a shit ton of freckles that i hated as a kid, but now i love em. you look so cute w freckles omggggg i know they didn't work but my imagination says freckles are FOR. YOU. GURL.
Hehehehehe I swear if it is a set of dots drawn on imma lose it just like I lost a try not to laugh challenge and this isn’t even meant to be laughed at😂😂😂😂
SHE IS WEARING THE LEISURE SUIT OMG
Sugar, lemon and water is lemonade
She should try Just for Men freckles next lol
“I wanna look like one of those cute outside people who go outside” mood
She looks like the 90’s nick smart girl look
Pipi longstocking wants to know your location.
”I feel like everyone just wants to watch me fail. I feel like everyone just wants to laugh at the sad freckle clown.”

“You’re not a sad freckle clown.”
i watched a one minute ad for you guys cuz apparently you get more money for it? I don't know it's a rumour i heard
Beach you look cute as hell 🤑🤑
Haha I have that exact same beauty mark but it’s a freckle not hena or pencil
She looks so good with no makeup!
You should dye your hair green and use it as a green screen.
I freckle and live in NY so I know what you mean 😂
I have a real beauty mark where you put yours😁
These actually look super natural IMO. I've thought about this for similar reasons (I had adorable freckles when I was younger, but avoid sun exposure these days). And I don't wear makeup, so honestly? Might actually try this! Thanks Jenna. You are a pioneer.
dear jenna lemme educate the people please
if u ever want to get henna never get the mixed one like u did here cuz henna should be bought as a powder then mixed with warm water freshly the store bought one used here  aka the american rip off is literal water and dye  and a spec of henna mixed with other plants and stuff oh and henna does come off 
oh and u said something bout coloring hair using henna the color only shows after multiple uses  and it comes off after not using it for a couple weeks or at most month or two and we usually use henna on our hair not for color yet for its amazing benefits its allegedly a plant from heaven
Can we have another Shane & Jenna collab tho
honestly it looks pretty realistic omg
You look like a strawberry😂😂😂 Lol. No hate tho. Ily💘
Tbh I think you look great without makeup on so the freckles could be really cute with just like maybe some eyeshadow and mascara
Lol 😂🤣
The world without Jenna Marbles would be a DARK place
Ok but honestly they did end up cute.
Skin care is working for you.  You look amazing without makeup.  For some reason I wanna say your skin makes your eyes pop?
I want them to be lOuD 😂😂😂
Henna get dark with time. First orange and then light brown.
“sunless void of rochester new york” 

ok first of al, true
Damn you looking like a ripe banana
the transitions took me out
WTF FRECKLES JUST MAKE YOU LOOK MORE LIKE SAOIRSE RONAN
Julian:It’s important to know when to stop. 
Jenna: Wym
Julian: you look cute wit freckles
this looks so good omg
This thumbnail disturbes me, idk why
Ok I started here 5 hours ago I've been watching jenna marbles for 5 hours I've ended back here holy shit I need to get of the internet
I think her mom tried to edit this with the IMovie effect transitions
Make your whole living room into a blanket fort
Can't wait to get out of Central Ny. Its a trap don't ever come here people.
Was this edited on windows movie maker?
This video should just be called “Jenna Plays With iMovie Transitions for 14 Minutes”
You look cute like Willow in Buffy.
DAMN! Who that girl with the freckle? She so tall too.
the self tanner was a pretty neat idea
Her eyebrows look really good in this video
With hena with hair it wonk be very vibrant it will make ur hair red a bit and make ur hair smell goo
This reminds me of something I did as a kid! I remember one morning I woke up and said "I want freckles!" And so for about ten minutes before heading for school my sister put little brown dots on my face with makeup. The next day I also wanted freckles but my sister didn't want to do it again so I just took a crayola marker and dabbled my face in HUGE dots.. I confused so many people, lol

Also uhhhh tip for henna
Leave it on for several hours (the entirety of a day works) and try not to hydrate it or touch it, after that I'll crumble off itself
can we all just though, that jenna IS the 32 year old lady mother of the entire youtube community
aries editing at its finest
That looked good!
no shade but copied naomi 🥴
So what we’ve learned today is that peach is the normal dog.
Kermit sounds like a broken kazoo or a deflating balloon at different times
He’s the over-emotional, over-dramatic member of the family that the rest of the family doesn’t understand at all but loves and tolerates anyway.
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Kermit: has an emotional breakdown
BREAKING NEWS
Saddest dog on Earth.
He gets sadder everyday knowing that we laugh at his cries.
Mr. Marble with no teeth makes me so happy he’s just smiling 24/7
No one:
Absolutely no one:
Kermit: 👁️💋👁️
             💧      💧
Kermit lowkey looks like Sid’s grandmother from Ice Age
Nobody: 

Kermit: BREATHING HARD ASF
kermit getting excited that jenna said 'good morning' to him is such a mood. i too get super excited when other people acknowledge my presence
Kermit- Licks foot
Jenna- Kermit, thats nasty
Kermit- Carries on licking foot
“We interrupt this moment of nasty, for a moment of appreciation”
*Softly*“Hi ma-ble!” 7:02 
This is so cute oh my god
Can u film marbles for a day
No one: 
Kermet: *monotone screaming*
“Did you just watch a 13 minute video of a dog crying?”





.........mind ya bizness
My brother stopped and looked while I was watching this and after a while he just said "it's a broken rat, that's not a real dog", and with all due love and affection, Kermit, I couldn't agree more.
I love how she said, 'Bright and nasty.' 
Sure enough, in the morning... it was bright. 
And there was The Nasty, crying for attention.
He's so sexually frustrated oh my god lmao
Are we just going to ignore the two dogs in the double stroller at 8:54
nobody:

kermit: cries
You’ve done a day of nasty - we may need a day of marble appreciation I think.
Can you make a video of Marble makings sounds or faces?
Cermet is obviously deprived of sexual experiences. He tried to bang every dog in that park, it seemed.
He looks like he’s constantly questioning his own existence and at the same time believes alien conspiracy theories
Thousands of years of humans breeding wolves has resulted in THIS.
no one : 


cement : i am tormented by eternal confusion whos origins i cannot recall
I never thought Kermit was so good at asmr
The audio in this video is the most cursed ASMR i've ever encountered.
I’m asking myself whether Kermit actually has some idk mental doggy stuff going in
“See you in the morning bright and nasty”
I've seen this in my recommendations for months and would be like "Wtf whos watching this". I finally gave in and this is gold.
Cermet licking foot
Jenna- Kermit thats nasty
Pauses for a second
Continues licking
Cermet looks like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons.
Kermit's barks are fake. He only cries.
I fully expected this video to be 24 hours long
jenna is just supplying content for kermit memes
Have you thought about trying a slow feeder dog bowl for Kermit?
He protec
He attac 
But most importantly 
He’s just plain NAST
You should get an emotional support dog for your dog lol (they have them)
No one: 
Kermit: 👁👅👁
He is cryin in the car because you are passing MacDonald, Burger King, hot dog stands!!!!!
He is more nervous and crying in one day than me during my exams😂😂😂
5:23 Marble: I should be an only child, this has gone on way too long
Kremet and peach, reminds me so much of my own dogs 

1: nervous and nasty (always crying)
2: food driven, and taking up all the space.  😂👏
julien: kermit don’t you swallow that thing whole
kermit: *swallows the treat whole*
julien: eughh
I'm surprised that this video is only 13 minutes long... I thought it would be at least 30 minutes based on all his mental breakdowns
Kermit is well behaved compared to my dogs.
Also he's so cuteeeee <3
5:38 KERMIT LITERALLY FLICKS HIS DROOL UPWARDS WTF
I was expecting an actual 24 hour video because he cries so much :3
THIS IS THE CONTENT I SIGNED UP FOR
"Kermit.."
Kermit: looks
"That's nasty.."
Kermit: l i c c
shows Kermit peeing which I did not expect

youtube : DeMoN O tIzeD
what if kermit is actually just doggy depressed and you all makin fun of him
5:24
Marbles walks in
Marbles: yo what’s poppin
(Edit) Omg tysm for 22 likes!!! Most likes I have had ever!
(Edit 2) 130 LIKES WHA THE FRICK! REEEEEEEEE
i was expecting this video to be 24 hours long because Kermit is ALWAYS a NaSTy bOI
"Film my dog whenever he's nasty, for 24 hours"

Video is 24 hours long
He looks like Snoop Dog; but he's not chill like Snoop Dog.

It's such a weird comparison
Why video only 13 minutes long? Cermat must cri all twenty foor hours or else he will not grow. Ceramic need attention and lov, if you don’t tell him he a gud boi he will not grahw.
The thumbnail has the word pickles behind Kermit and out of focus and that just screams Kermit energy
there are emotional support dogs and then there are dogs that need emotional support... ily kermit
i desperately need a supercut of Jenna saying "Hi Marble" all cutelike.
Kermit is like my cat she always cries and meows and DROWLS ALOT
marble reminds me of the self aware pit bull on Big Mouth
13 minutes of the sound expo markers make when they dry out
Kermit scares me on a level i can not understand. I am convinced he is a god
People always talked about how Kermit is so nasty and I never understood but OMG HES SO NASTY
Everything Cermet does he does with a look of utter desperation
if anything bad ever happened to kermit, Id be devastated. I love him so much
That poor Pomeranian was assaulted by nasty boi
The pattering of Cermit feet when the mic was hooked up to him was actually really nice. Call me weird but that's my favorite asmr sound ever.
Kermit's paws when she sais good morning omg 
EDIT: Kermit is me as a dog tho
Be careful,.. once they're gone you'll cry for SIX years after watching this again,.. - They're Soooo cute !!! :) - Happy Dogggs
No joke Jenna’s pretty good at sowing and crafts
That boy takes high maintenance to a new level.
Do part 2 and 3 and 4 with marble and peach and when she is ready to be the center of attention miss bunny! 
They are so precious and cute


...  also just do this two more times with cement. We are ready for more nasty content
Everytime I see marbles I'm like aw
licked by an angel: coming to theaters near you this summer
My favorite thing about Kermit is that he sticks his tongue out and dribbblessss from time to time so cute and funny!
Also I find it very ticklish when my dog licks me 10:12 best part 😎
Kermit is the biggest drama queen lmao
kermots the 14 yr old girl that self diagnosed herself with depression
"I filmed my dog whenever he cried or was nasty for 24 hours"

Me: since it's Kermit, expects a 24h video
😂😂😂😂
Lmao I have anxiety generalized disorder and I relate so much 😂😂😂 I love how you handle" him, So much love and understanding and compassion and acceptance just he way he is, gives me hope I can find that for myself in this world thanks Janna ! Always been a fan for years~ first comment xo
Middle child’s life: 
roasts cermet 💀
1 second after: 
hAaaI mEbBleE ❣️💕💙💚💞💛💖💜🧡💖💘
New idea for the video “squeaky door or Kermit crying”
My boyfriends dog is like Kermit but about 30 lbs heavier
you can pick one




Kermit the dog

Or

Kermit the frog.
You are blessed to know him. God SAID he would pour out his spirit on ALL creatures. This we are seeing in the end of the Age of Grace.
he sounds like how the miserables (yes, the entire book) would sound if it were a real being lol
This is the first time I've seen Marbles so alive
Ok this changed my mind on cement!!🤣🤣 he is very very weird
I think he has severe separation anxiety  :(
That's why he's always stressed and eats so quickly
You guys are awesome💗 it's funny how Kermit behaves...
Omg..its hilarlious!! She's nervous & anxious like my dog!! Hahahaha
At this point I am so disillusioned that I don't even register Kermit as a dog anymore. He's just his own thing.
can we get the full version of this please
I watched this with my iggy in the room and she keeps tilting her head every time Kermit cries
Cement sounds like bicycle breaks that need fixed
I love cermit

Ps. My cat is real concern for cermit.
Remember when Jenna brought kermit home and she thought he was just crying because he was in a new place..... lol
"I love you kermie." Idk why that made me so emotional but it did
I love at 5:23 marble walks in like a drunk uncle
That drooling is epic! Haha
5:24 looks like my grandma walking out her room😂
Okay, we can all agree that Kermit is a nasty boi but can we also all agree that the shot of appreciation for Marbles was one of the cutest Marbles smiles on record
Nobody: 
Kermit: absolutely inhales his food in 3 bites
I understand. My cocker spaniel does this it’s absolutely annoying at times. Crying for no reason. 🤷🏽‍♀️
he's honestly the weirdest dog ever. alot of dogs are silly and have quirks. he's...so nasty.
kermit looks like he is constantly crying/internally dying
all this has taught me is that kermit is basically an elderly vulture with crippling social anxiety
6:08-6:12 was actually so pure because cement was all "Papa!! :'D"
My cats kept dreaming out during this whole video 😂
Jenna marble’s leg:



Kermit: 👁👅👁
My dog whines the same way sometimes and my friend told me it sounds like an old man driving a squeaky shopping cart through a parking lot and that stuck with me
I will never think a Jenna marbles video is clickbait
Kermit is a dog that need more attention than others , follow that anxiety maybe it can be resolved 
Ps: he make me cry wen he cry
3:21 the snaps I send to my friends at 1am
The personality of my dog: cries, wants food, wants more food, barks, barks, barks, barks, rubs awag
I was expecting this video to be 24 hours long tbh xD
peach is the only normal dog
A day in the life of a Sermit.. straight up NASTY
I wonder if Cermit just secretly knows how to do a lot of tricks. Lol
what the hell wrong with carmax
5:25 Marbles comes in the back door like he was at the club all night and just got home...he was lead by Kermit's cries
JnJ memes is gonna have a field day with all his footage
What's wrong with Herman why you do that he got a second letter problem they got dog psychiatrist you can take him to something is bothering him deeply
This should have been a 24 hour video...
At 3:28 haha he just like stops looks at you and then goes back to it hahaha
Kermit incessantly crying over minor inconveniences is a big mood
I was watching this and my pup was crying 😂
NOBODY: 

ME: ASMR ???
i thought marble was dead
Kermit - The nation's dog
Don’t even need an edit to make this a horror trailer
Edit: Almost top comment HELLLLLL YEAHHHHHH
I have to feed my dog the same exact way!
From my 5 year old... "He's cute but weird."
Anyone else notice that they cut out a lot of the video??
The loudest noises: 
3. Windows startup sound at 2 am
2. An airplane taking flight 
1. Kermut eating
I just came from her video of when she first got him.


They have both peaked
How can you take your life seriously if you have Kermit as a dog
I thought this video would be 24 hours long. I’m surprised it’s not.
Kermit:

Nobody:

Jenna: "Thas Nasty"
Put Kermit Peach and Marbles in green suits so only there faces are showing and put them in front of a green screen
Cermit reminds me of crash bandicoot. "Crash Nasticoot"
Se párese a la liendra el perrito 😘😘😘🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hello can we have PINK hair Julen back
kermot represents the human race
I see now that I have underestimated Kerm's nastiness, he is truly the king of nasty boi
I did the math and if Kermit is 8 and this is 13 minutes long he has cried 37,960 minutes in his life
every time kermit whined all three of my dogs would join in 😂
this made me laugh so hard.
"Bright and nasty" 😂
Alternative title: Mom and Dad record their emotionally sensitive and questionable child.
Why don't you let her man go have his way with another dog and that it might satisfy his appetite and he might not cry as much he wants to release
Does anyone else think Marbles bark cute?
omg. Kermit is so fricken cute!!!!
Asmr on a next level
That shot of Mr. Marbles smiling in the car is the most precious thing I've ever seen
KERMIT ASMR VIDEOS PLZ OMG
Awwww Kermit reminds me SO much of my dog Chance with all his sounds and mannerisms. I miss him 😭 thanks for sharing all the nasty Kermit things.
This was too much XD
I luv your cermet
Marbles is so much more... alive? now that his teeth aren't hurting him
Kermit makes me so anxious. You’re really good at handling him, really 🤗
This was oddly relaxing lol
this is what i signed up for
Why can i not stop laughing at kermits  face 😂😂😂😂
Now I feel like appreciating marble for 24 hours😁
I can't with that dog .(cry all the time,and pee everywhere) ..... u r very  patient  with ur dog.
I came here for a lot of gringe/cute not a lesson, lady.
Great video though. So nasty I could cry.
I would just like to state that marbles is the cutest old man dog ever 😍
Oh my god this is hysterical
If he was a human he wouldn’t be allowed within 500 metres of schools or parks
this was awesome. thank you for immortalizing this dog in the history of youtube. all the love for Kermit!!
This is one of my fav videos!!!I watch this every so often just to laugh
Oh mr marble is getting up there! Love u old guy
no one:
kermit: humps strangers face
mr marbles is LOUD and ALIVE
Drops it
Thank you Kermit 

grinds on it 






We all know Jenna is just thinking WHYYYYYYY
Tbh I rewatch this every day just for the marbles moment of appreciation it’s just so pure
Captions say 
Because my dog permit here..


The frick?
i was watching this and my dog was with me, when he heard kermit's cries he started to look for him, d'awwhh. 💛
Call me crazy but I think we need a 24 hr video of each dog
He looks just like Brian Griffin 😂
all dogs lick other dogs ears, they like ear wax lol.
speaking from experience
That KITCHEN IS GORGEOUS
i was watching this and my dog was concerned
if my social anxiety was a dog
This is one of these things you didnt know you needed till you got it.
I haven't watched jenna marbles since I was a little kid.. I'm 24 now and I dont remember Kermit crying so much!! :(
He looks like dobby from Harry Potter/love him, and he’s so cute
for balance purposes i'm going to need 13 straight minutes of peach relaxing and looking pretty
No one:
Literally no one:
Kermit:AAAAHSHOWWHO😭
Marbles:👁👄👁
No one:
Literally no one:
Kermit:AAAAHSHOWWHO😭
Marbles:👁👄👁
Rise and grind gamers. Let's get nasty
5:00 WHY ARE PETS LIKE THIS?
like my cat will have a mental breakdown if i dont feed him 0.02 seconds after ive opened my eyes
I never seen a mentally unstable dog till now
Why is he always sleepy and looks so depressed?! 😂
this triggered my dog
I know this comment will get lost but I’m gonna say it anyway. Thank you for making this video. On especially hard days  I come back to this. Idk why it helps but it does. Your dogs are my only counter for anxiety since I can’t afford a dog of my own or therapy. Much love.
Best Video Ever!!👏👏 Kermit looked so handsome in that jacket🤩🤩
it must be hard on him, being an icon literally all of the time.
Shoulda named the cute little guy tit bag Tammy lol he is adorable though
Extras Video 2019
10 straight minutes of Kermit crying
Please and thank you
you know.. 
Kermit was on it for like 3 seconds but what a nasty boy
9:01 Omg I laughed so hard. I can't breathe.
Now that marbles has all of his teeth removed, he looks like he has a permanent smile☺️
Y'all should hire a dog whisperer to see why he cries so much
S/O to videos of Kermit for always getting me out of a deep sad 😂
HE A N A S T Y  B O I
This is funny, my whippet displays some of these same behaviors.  Sight hounds are the best!
no one: 
kermit: aggressively humps dogs face
when he had the mic on the clacking of his nails on the floor was incredible satisfying
He's just an emotional little pupper ;(
Kermit: whimpers softly

My cat: SCREEEEEEEECCCHHHH
your dogs are always nasty




this comment was made by jacksfilms gang
2019 with Jenna has brought us the content we never knew we needed.
No one:
Absolutely nobody:
Kermit: cries in nasty boi
ASMR: Cermit is a nasty boi.
DISCLAIMER!!! lots of nastiness,cuteness,and cryness in this video.
You should make Kermit do a ASMR
Jenna:...
Kermit:👁👁
               👅💧
My dog does EXACTLY the same things kkkk
My Cats did NOT appreciate this hahahaha ... I think they were genuinely concerned for Kermit haha
I like small dogs that frantically shake and bark at everything in exsistence, just as much as I love stumbling upon a hoarde of death claw in fallout new Vegas.

Not my cup of tea.
lets take a moment to just… breath look here 7:06 FRICKIN BEAUTIFUL!!
JnJ Memes is going to have a field day
He protecc
He atacc
But most importantly
He liccs the leg
I watched this with my dog in the room and he came up to me and licked my arm to comfort me because he thought I was crying, i-
Kermit cries because he has been strong for too long
My dog cries all the time but not loudly..
Aww the doggy is so cute😄😍

And i dont get why People are hateful to this dog 😞
I finally listened to this vid with my noise cancelling studio headphones and confirmed, made it 10x more nasty
What is he doing at 10:25?!?😂😂
he's cute like reaally cute. But he also looks like he smokes a pound of pot every morning😂😂😍
Ma’am, I think your squirrel is broken.
Film marbles for a day now, I NEED to see that
I seriously laughed so hard the whole video I couldn’t breathe. He is so ridiculous that it’s brilliant. Love U kermie!!!
omg!! he is the cutest thing ive ever seen! I was dying this whole vid it was hilarious!
His walking sound with the mic on sounded like ASMR lol
Next video : Recording Julian to see all his Aries behavior and hear him breathe heavily
this video should have been 24 hours long...
Julien: why are you crying?
Cermet: since when do I need a reason?
Julien:
Cermet: cries*
*cries with kermit*
YOU HAVE MORE FOLLOWERS THAN BEYONCÉ
OMG I knew he was nasty but I didn't know he was THAT nasty
records me whenever I'm crying or nasty
video: 24 hours
jeanna please do a morning/daytime routine because i would really enjoy that. I loved the joke ones but i kinda want a serious one
When you see your self as a peach but your really a Kermit 😂 sad and nasty
I think the problem isn’t that Kermit acts nasty, it’s more that he just is a nasty nasty little goblin creature who is just unpleasant and I love that about him
I just wanna watch marbles be cute and hear his little bork
Aaawww, such a good boi 😋😊🐕🐶🐾❤️❤️❤️
Kermit is a living soundboard
I'm seeing Dobby from HP
Kermit: whines about how no one will play with him 

Two seconds later: assaults every dog in a 10 mile radius
Showed this to my dog and she started sniffing my phone when he cried
Your sewing skills , well to be nice about it, I mom told me if you don't have anything nice to say , don't say it.





Your sewing skills suck.
8:32 Marble CHONK Edition
Oh I think you got plenty of nasty. #dogpark
Literally anything happens

Kermit: Cries
My dog is genuinely concerned he stops playing. Lol
honestly Kermit is one of my favorite dogs😂
Oh my god this video is at 10 mil views. 






As it should be.
Kermit: 👁👅👁



Me: i felt that.
It may seem like Jenna is running out of ideas but this is EXACTLY what we signed up for
no one: 
cement: *cries in nasty*
7:03 is the best
No one: 
Literally no one: 
Kermit: * cries*
When he drooled with his tongue out while she prepped his dinner I DIED 😂🤣
Marbles seems so much happier since having his teeth pulled!
omg Marbles is so cute
Nobody...literally nobody:

Kermit: Fast intense nervous breathing
I seriously could watch a week of this.
This dog is cracking me up lol he's so cute
I always felt sorry for Kermit and just thought that he wanted love and attention. I finally understand. 








N   A   S   T   Y         B   O   I
Kermit is James Charles rn. Sorry... Just hit me😂😂😂
Absolutely no idea why I watched this but I did lol
are we sure cermet was not the Skeksis Chamberlain from the Dark Crystal in a previous life
4:11*  he’s a nasty boi NASTY BOI on the floor !!
After so much NASTY we need a Marbles appreciation video to recover
He is the most depressed dog i have seen XD i frwkaung love him
I LOVVVVVVVE CERMIT 







(If that how u spell he’s name )
This whole video made my dog and cats so worried 😹😹
He's actually the nastiest dog I've ever seen lmao I love him
Marbles is so much more livelier since his teeth are gone.
im watching with the audio off bc im listening to a 10 hour loop of the wii music and this is now strangely relaxing... love this little one
I often come back and watch this video just for 7:02
Why does Kermit remind me of that one middle school boy who still wears those Velcro sketchers shoes, wears the same cargo shorts everyday, and pulls his shorts and underwear all the way to the floor when he takes a piss 
I-
Y’all know how some people need emotional support dogs well Kermit  needs an emotional support human LIKE REALLY BAD
Nastiest part was Kermit trying to get a blow-job from the pomeranian
Im getting flashbacks to minecraft
no one:
kermit: 2:41
who can comment how many times they said kermit😂
You should’ve titled this, “I Filmed my Dog for 24 Hours”
A few videos back when Jenna said "Kermit I love you but you test me every day boy!"... I now feel like I have a deep appreciation for that sentiment. And this was just a 24 hour period of his nastiness.
I feel like he is a grumpy old man at the end 🤣
7:02 can I get more moments of appreciation for Marbles?!
first video i've seen from your channel.....WELP I KNOW WHO KERMIT IS Or is it Cermit????? Idk i know who he is
Every time you said “Kermit!” My Shiba thought y’all were saying “Kirby!” And was wondering what he did.
Kermit: eats food


Literally No one: 


Kermit: 
wait.... isn't Kermit a cancer? like the zodiac sign... it would explain a lot honestly 😂😂😂
hes such a good boy i love him hes so cute
Everytime marble barks its a mood
Totally just watched the video where you picked up Kermit for the first time and there's the part where you got in the car and he's whining and you said something along the lines of "awww do you hear the sounds he's making?" And all I could think is , he never stopped making those sounds
how is the video not at least 10 hours long
Classic Italian greyhound...yah
I relate to Kermit on a spiritual level
He is a whole drama queen and we all appreciate it😂
I like how we have 15 minutes of content of Kermit just making weird noises
JnJ memes has 13 minutes of meme footage now
Your eyebrows are tiny floating rectangles. Luv u Jenna
Bring that close up dog ASMR. BRING IT.
I love Jenna's video titles. They just let me know what's up. I appreciate that.
Nobody: 
Kermit to feet: 11:21
Kermit is like your emotional support animal, who also needs emotional support
I need a part 2 this is the content I’ve been waiting for
this video made my dog need therapy
And the video is 24 hours long
I love how that Jenna knows the exact reason why Kermit is crying
Gross. Just EEEW and GROSS.🤑🤮🤮
There are some bowls with like walls and/or spirals inside, for gods and cats that eat too fast! I've seen ppl calling them Slow feeders!
Hey......
Idk....
If you know....
But......
Your dog humps other peoples dogs...............
And THATS NOT OK LOL
best part is marble lookin happi
I haven't been able to relate to a dog before, but I do now. I got some Anxiety too, Cermit- I MEAN, Kermit! 😆
Jenna: exists
Cermet:
👁👄👁
💧      💧
My dog was so concerned while watching this 😂
I'm sorry but kermit sounds like a old car that can't start up very well


You could probably make a song using his cries
11:07
Marble: Screams for no reason.
Kermit: Me at a store with a methhead near me.
Annoying and adorable in same exact moment. So, not only my lil sis have this ability xD
His faces can make the best memes 😂 this is the best 😂😂
Marbles is the rough dum one
Kermit is the sensitive weird one
And Peach is the hot Chick with a Food obsession
Kermit a nasty boi
Kermit a sad boi
But most important Kermit is good boi
10:17 11:21 x,D hahahaha oh how  I love little kerm
Ngl kind of living for the Kermit asmr at the beginning
Can't wait for next episode: "Marbles barking at everything and being nasty for 24 hours" And the next video after that "Peach being way too energetic and annoying her brothers for 24 hours"
Kermet:drulls 
Julien:aww he drulling a hole puddle
Dogs are gross. I love all three of my dogs, so very very much, but they’re gross. ❤️
Can she auto tune Kermit xd
He just has too much love for his moma he doesn't know how to process it
I ain’t no doctor but I think you dog is broken
he literally needs a pet therapist
he said: 👀💦👅👣
Bright and Nasty 😂😂
3:28
Jenna:KERMIT 
kermit stops licking foot
Jenna:Thats NASTY
Kermit: 
I love Kermit but why does he look like a sock puppet when he's crying
If I had Karmit for one day he wouldn't cry because I have a magic trick
Ok 11:20-11:23
You should make a song out of all of Kermit’s noises. i’d listen to that so fast 🔥
The nasty man is a celebrity. I love him so much
Did you try turning it off and on again?
your demon spawn of a dog turned me into a cat person. thanks very much
Even though he kinda mad he still cute
Crying makes your Cermit grow
👁👄👁
Kermit is a lot like my dog deputy it's hilarious. I laughed so much, love your videos and your doggies ♡♡
Kermit: wants attention

Jenna: makes whole video about Kermit getting attention

Kermit: cries
I come here for the sound of Thier claws
My dog is exactly like Kermit and I thought I was raising him badly 😭 

but I learned from the comments that my dog is going through an existential crisis stemming for depression over realizing he’s a doggo 

Help me😭
Video is 24 hours long
2:08
He's a NASTY! boy
have you tried putting it in rice?
Oh man I don't even know what your channel is about; i think we just need raw kermit running around audio. It made me laugh. Lmao.
Kermit just had 2 threesomes. What did you do today?
I had to put on headphones cause when Kermit cried my dogs started to cry XD
Kermit: ASMR edition
Why does Kermit look like an insecure grey meerkat?
Kermit: does something a dog normally does 
Jenna&julien: NASTY REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Please don’t call him nasty....😊
Why do you make so many asmr videos lol
A god to rival mister bubs
I just can't believe a creature like kermit exists. So much personality...so much emotion...in a such a small body...
Do u think Kermit actually realizes sometimes that he's crying or does it just happen serious question 😂
Asmr much 😂
That first minute gave me so much asmr
I think Kermit has depression
Kermit:
Jenna and Julien: N A S T Y B O I
please do a video with an animal psychic. PLEASE I wanna know what goes on in his complicated little mind
Kermit didn't cry after he got some 😂
Lmao Jenna Kermit has middle child syndrome 😂♥️
OMG, Kermit needs a veterinarian enhanced Darwin award to the afterlife.
I love how in some of the direct portrait shots of kermit, his nose is the only thing in focus because the camera isnt able to see the rest of his face, so many miles away from the end of his schnozz
Kermit is a savage at the dog park. No holds barred, he mounted everything
OMG he reminds me sooo  much about my dog, he also cried all the time like this :'D
That, right there, is the most middle-class, millenial looking dog I've ever seen. He looks like everything in the universe fills him with a deep sense of anxiety-ridden pathos. For no real reason.
Even when his feet are happy, his face looks like it needs expensive and pointless therapy.
Wow ... Kermit is the creepy uncle of the family lol
Cermit is like me on my period
so emotional
Watching Kermit cry made my dog cry 🤣
I’ve been watching ur vids for months now and still don’t know what you mean by nasty can someone tell me pls. Gross or mean?
He seems so unhappy with exsisting.
Kermit is THAT dog at the dog park.
YAYYYY WE GET A 24 LONG VIDEO
kermit exposed: the shocking true story
You should make him cry and put it into auto tune like that one dog lol 😂
My dog noxi is nasty often. And cries a lot. And she cries if I don’t talk to her. So I have to say
Hello 
Good morning 
I’m home. Yeah I’m home
Baby come here I’ll give you hugs. 
Good night baby
Bear bear night 
Snuggles it’s bed time

If I dont she cries. So I call her cermet and Kermit because she cries a lot like kerm. She and I always watch a video a Jenna marbles dogs in the morning cause she cries
he sounds like a dry erase marker when it starts to get dry
I think maybe Kermit is frustrated
What I learned today
Do not watch videos of Kermit on full volume with no headphones around my dogs
And this is why I will forever own cats.
3:26 has me dead
He just looked at Jenna like yeh ok shaddup
Jenna: Kermit...
Kermit: Stops a stares awkwardly.
Jenna: That's Nasty... 
Kermit: Continues...
Its ok Kermit I love u
My dog cries ALL THE TIME
Her name is Lily
So we called her Lily geignarde ( Moaning Lily )

(In Harry Potter, Moaning Myrtle’s name in French is Mimi geignarde)
AWWWWWWW HES SO CUTE!! he's such a cute whipet and the other one
Kermit has a lot of mental breakdowns. He's such a mood
Kermit is me at 9 months pregnant crying 24/7 because of everything and nothing
Why isn’t the video 24 hours long?
that thing is like a walking whiny faucet i swear to dog
Kermit is legit an anxious college kid or a senile old man. There is no in between.
Kermit: Rubs his cheeks against things.

Marbles: Licks/grooms his mates.

I think your dogs are cats.
I laughed so hard my parents were about to put ear plugs in
I would just love a dog that cries for attention and then bites you when you pet them 🙃
I love how he sticks his tongue out
Not the content I thought I wanted




But the content I god damn NEEDED
Kermit got REALLY NASTY at the park
Jacksfilms dogs are better
Why wasn’t the video 24 hours long
You call that drooling? Hold my beer! * fetches the Great Dane * No, please. I insist upon showing you how life can be a slobbery pool of hell! 
Kermit is the perfect combination of weird looking and adorable. Love that face ❤️
Kermit crying sounds like a mirror being wiped
my dog cries as often as kermit but he does bcs he's a little whiny baby who can't be seperated from his family. even 5 minutes and he cries so damn loud and agonizing. 😥
Tokio Hotel was never as emo as Kermit is.
i have to say kermit is buy far the strangest dog ever..... i fricken love it<3
SEND EM TO THE RANCH
Kermit always has his tongue out
9:00 cement is a NaStY BoI
Kermit as the motto of my life👌
Kermit looks like he having an emotional breakdown in general.
Why tf do I keep watching this
Surprised the video wasnt 24 hours long
That day is a day before my birthday👸🏿🎉🎊🏅🙎🏼‍♀️💖😉😁🏆like if u wish me happy birth day commet how old am i
Jenna: Cermet don’t be nasty
Cermet: is nasty
Jenna: 😮
This feels weird not being in content aware scale
Kermit is a man on a mission in many ways, especially in the park 😐
I got a new puppy a few weeks ago and every time Kermit would cry in the video, my dog would tilt my head and stare at the screen and then finally she just started crying too
The parts where Kermit started to hump the poor dogs face had me done 😂🤣
A video about Kermit trending at #2 behind a song called MIDDLE CHILD is one of the top best things that has happened on the internet
11:23 is me When someone tries to take my food
I love that you don’t feed a kibble base diet
That dog needs Prozac
Can you please have a pet physic see Kermit and figure out why he cries lol
The tongue sticking out of Cermet's mouth kills me completely. 😂
7:46  Kermit zoomed out of there😂😂
What is wrong with your goblin?
God, how was this already three months ago????
My dog kept staring at me throughout this video, and every time Kermit cried my dog would tilt his head to the side. He wanted to rescues the distressed dog  😂
Shane Dawson should make an inside the mind of Kermit series I would watch it...
Hello! Do you have any idea why he is so emotional? Or does he have some kind of anxiety?  =/
Such a nasty boi.
I thought this video was going to be 24hrs long
literally no one :

kermit : ***cries**
Is in depression, abstinence,the dog needs a girlfriend.
Has no one else thought to do a meme video where they show clips of Kermit being "nasty" to the sound track from Floops Flooglies where he says "nasty nasty nasty nasty!"
That dawg needs weed! Or CBD.. I had so much fun watching this video!  And all it consisted of was an undisciplined naughty little dawg with major anxiety coupled with a good dose of complex PTSD.! My favorite parts:  a=> Kermet rolling on a turd in the dog park, making sure to get the stank on both sides of his neck,
b=> Jenna givin' Kermit some love and petting his neck right after a,
c=> Kermit turning in a circle whilst laying on his side just like one of the Three Stooges, and last, but not least,
d=> Kermit making sure he did a good job rubbing both sides of his park stank coated neck on Jenna's lady parts scrubber 😜
  
I played this video to my dog and she was constantly looking for the distressed dog
it's clear that kermit would not be able to handle it if you guys had a normal day job
Kermit gives me anxiety
glad to see snoop dogg has aged well, although he is a little nasty
Kermit's cries woke up the dogs I'm pet sitting and they went nuts barking lol!!
The fact that Kermit loves you enough to want to rub your scent all over himself is very sweet.
nobody:
kermit: cries
I kind of want someone to make a soundboard of Kermit's cries and then for Jenna to play them back to him.
Someone please do an edit of this video, but every time Cermet cries or is nasty it gets faster.
You spin me right round baby right round 10:22
Please follow Marbles for a day, he's such a sweet heart 😩❤
My favourite part starts at 11:21
pooooor kermit the struggle is real
He is just like my dog \(> w <)/
JnJ memes is gonna have a field day with all these nasty clips
What about using one of those dog sweaters that looks like a hoodie with a pocket and then put the mic on his collar?
He is so silly
And I thought my cat was weird
This dog is just uncomfortable with existing
cermet looks like a mole-rat granny that only eats instant oatmeal and won’t stop thinking about her dead husband arnold
Cermet is hooman child must cry 24-7
Those types of dogs look like they have tumors for ribs
this is why I don't have pets
why is he such a meme
Kermit looks like he's always getting over the trauma of realizing he's a dog

Edit: holy likes thank you
oh that pupper needs a hug, what a cutie
N A S T Y  B O Y
Go👏pro👏the👏boy
Maybe Kermit is depressed and that is why he acts out and cries. 😞❤️
Someone edit a song out of his cries
And here I thought my dog was loud 😆
Sometimes you just need a little bit of nasty to make you feel comfortable.
He is a nasty boi
This was the video I wanted and I didn’t even know
My life in one video
Guess I want an Italian Greyhound now.
I can't believe Kermit downvoted this video 12,000 times.
Kermit is awesome.
I’d like to add another comment about wanting a marbles version. I love that tiny old man
He walks so weird omg 😂😂😂😂
My dog does the same thing
We named him doby
3:56 He sounds like a shit bike braking down a steep hill
I wonder if Kermit cries cus he remembers something bad? trauma (I'm sure they ain't hurting him but idk)
I really just spent 13 minutes watching a dog cry. I’m oddly satisfied.
I'm with a meme of Julian being a depressed father because of Kermit's crying
I love how Kermit is just trying to root every dog at the park hahahaha
Omfg 😳 this is my dogs long lost twin fr 😂 my dog does all of these things except for the droll
I was rewatching this video on my tv and when Kermit was crying my dog ran from the other side of the house and stared at the screen every time he cried 😂
I'm glad to see Marble still smiling even though he's toof-less.
My dog was so distressed by this
This was amazing
I watched and my cat became concerned when she heard Kermit crying in the car. She came up to me and decided she needed to give me licks and kisses on my face. She was very concerned. I think she thought I was making the noises. So whatever Kermit was saying-apparently cats understand it as nervous upset language too. 

Poor Kermit. I mean, maybe he just wants a girlfriend. Looks like it at the dog park...haha. Such an odd dog.
Kermit is my spirit animal.
Jenna: Posts this 
JnJ memes: it’s free real estate
Maybe he cried because he wasn't able to make love/ Heart broken
3:27 😂😂 “KERMIT DATS NASTY...”
he sounds like a broken flute when he cries, especially when he was in the car
What breed is he??? Thats absolutely the cutest video i've ever watched! :)
Kermit looks like a malnourished seal.
Kermit: Does anything
Everyone:
Na
Nast
Nasty a
Nasty as a
Nasty as all
Nasty as all he
Nasty as all hell
Nasty as all he
Nasty as all
Nasty as a
Nasty a
Nast
Na
cries in tears
HAHAHAHAHA 3:22
She never fails to give us videos no other YouTuber would think to produce but should
Your poppers is so adorable
This video made me realize how truly nasty Kermit is like I though my dog was nasty sometimes but Kermit takes it to a new level
Part two pls
Needy dog lol
kermit sounds like that one kid in gym class that won't stop squeaking his sneakers on the floor
Jenna marbles reminds me of my 7th grade language arts teacher except younger
Kermit is actually a person trapped in a dog's body
cement being a nasty boy for 13 minutes straight
N A S T Y   boi is best boi
Kermit is a park predator.
Ohh he is so adorable and funny.. even when he’s nasty.. haha
When you tryin' to take a selfie in dim light, but it just won't focus... 5.53
Maybe cermit has something in his brain or something complex that makes him cry, please check for that, Love your channels
I want Kermit and marbles to be my dogs, lol.
Cermet is a ňą§ţý böį
I wonder if he has an emotional disorder. I mean, I relate to him with my anxiety and depression, being sad or anxious about a thing I was fine with the day before, all of that kind of stuff.
Oo Kermit had a good time at the dog park
Ya little nasty
Kermit should be the host of a show that features emotionally unstable dogs
No one :


Kermit:  👁 👁
                     👅🦶
That sound you make when you mom tells  you to go wash the dishes so you run back to your room
More dog videos plzz I loved this video
I think I want a dog like cement
My dog freaked out because of the crying😂
So much anxiety in such a little creature lol
My mother used to have an italian greyhound that was just like this. Such a baby 😂 always crying.
I relate to Kermit so much I
What if someone made a "if Jenna marbles dogs were dubbed" it would just be Kermit crying in human voice
8:36 Kermit really steps up his game; adding sexual harassment to his list
Marbles smile at 7:07 killed me!! Hes so precious.
Like this joke is marbles dead?
Thats literally my dog every day
Kermit sounds like letting the air out of a balloon when he cries
Is it just me or does Marble seem far more alive in recent videos?
Cermit: why won't anyone chase me?

Also Cermit: ~humps every dog in sight~
Cement is not pretty when cri
This is my kind of asmr
I would low key hate to live with him
lts so good inbhd
He is the living embodiment of anxiety.
That's my Iggy hands down!
KERMIT IF YOU DONT STOP CRYING
Does anyone else kinda want the full unedited version???
This video made my lab start whining
How did you guys manage to get the absolute weirdest dog in the universe?
But when Marbles walks in from outside at 5:25 lookin high and the camera zooms in. I can't. These dogs have the most hilarious faces and I was crying the entire time.
Cermits that pervey grandpa that’s all I have to say
7:48 
Ew look he peed on me
Ur face reminds me of Mr. Beast
You guys should blur out Kermit from now on before you get demonitized
Peach is the only mentally stable one
Asmr of a dogs day 😂😂
5:26 looks the sane as the meme
3:26  😂
why is the sound of Kermit scampering around so funny
You need to make an ASMR video of Kermit crying
It's like he wants to cry more but doesn't have any tears left
I have a jack Russell  (basically loud cermets ) and he NASTY.
too bad the oscar nominations are already out, this would've triumphed in the shorts category
Kermit is like a child at the store wanting a toy but his mom keeps telling him no 😂😂😂 I love Kermit so don’t come @ me
Honestly kermit has a better life than me
such a gemini
kermit drooling is me in class
Meeble is really out here living his best life as a senior citizen. I’m glad he’s doing well.
He sounds like when you stretch the top of a balloon and let it deflate
bicycle boy finally got a video dedicated to him
Must have been hard to edit down a 24 hour video
At least he's not nasty in that he bites.  That's a whole other nasty.  Ok one bite, but that was different.  He's a great boy.
Kermit is a gremlin. A loveable gremlin
LOL dogs are so weird. I love the other little dog <3
Bruh Kermit is me at different times of the day
Can cermat teach me the art of NASTY
I didn’t ask for this
but I’m glad it’s here
marble always looks like hes gonna choke on his own tongue
Get affections, nice home, food, parents, siblings, clothes, all body parts, and water.





CRIES.
10:42 the moment he did that sneeze thing I laughed so hard.
Nice walking clock.
Kermit’s whimpering and crying sounds like a balloon slowly being deflated
10:24 me at 2am
He's such a weirdo.
Kermit is my spirite animal. 👌
Kermit is an adorable existential crisis
Finally, its here.

The video we’ve all been waiting for.
Put a go pro on your emotionally unstable dog! Please!?!
Jenna: That's what I use to wash myself in shower..
Nobody:
Kermit: ~ Tries to wash the nasty off but ends up being nasty ~
I can't be the only other person who would still download and enjoy listening to 24 hours of mic'd Kerm. Also that sound vest is outrageously ADORABLE.
what if the dog is a reincarnation, and his crys are frustration not not being able to convey a message
he's like an angry seal with legs.
Kermit has big gollum energy
cermit is the dog version of me
kermit has big pisces energy
Marbles looks so happy since his teeth removal. It makes my heart melt.
kermit just sitting on his ass screaming is my dogs permanent mood xD
Marbles looks like a drunk Cuban man at a wedding
How is this video not 24 hours long?
Kermit ASMR
I just watched 13 minutes of a dog slurping food, heavy breathing, and crying in fullscreen without ever feeling bored. What a time to be alive
So its basically this is a video of a dog being a dog XD
Whenever I watch a video with kermit, my dog becomes so concerned that she runs over to the computer, trying to find the poor crying dog. I've started wearing headphones.
one day in the life of kermit
This girl has extremely cute feet. TELL ME I"M WRONG!
Im beginning to think Peach is the only normal one. 😂😂😂
Wow she got old... I'd still smash tho.
I need me some Kermit asmr
Get a real job! And your average!
Kermit: 🤤
             💧
             🌊
jenna marbles represents the small part of youtube that is still untainted
Awwww love kermit!
Why does Kermit cry?
I’ve never in my entire life seen a dog eat in such a horrifying way
The baby just doesn't like driving in a car, no problem with that
Kermit you dirty old man you!
Kermit needs a emotional support dog
He's so cute!!
Can we please get a day in the life of marbles and peach i love the dog videos so much
no one: 
kermit: 👁👄👁
              💧     💧
I think he cry because he never get a girlfriend
This made my entire day
You know if Kermit was adopted his previous owner abused him then that would totally explain all the all the wine and he does but no he just a super weird dog
7:50 WTF IS THAT NOISE OML 😂😂😂😂😂😂
WE LOVE A TOOTHLESS MARBLE
Kermit literally has actually tears like my dog cries but near tears
My lord Kermit be humping all the dogs.
Have you tried giving him a slow feed bowl? It’d keep him from eating so fast he vomits.
This is the type of content I ask for
*Kermit walking asmr*
0:01-1:08 Asmr Kermit
kermit was literally trying to breed with that white dog lol, not just dominance. he had a bo n e r, and he played, then humped, then played, then humped. that's how they breed.
Kermit going around in circles on the rug is one HELL of a mood 😩❤️💕
Ok Jenna. Just HOW MUCH FOOTAGE of cermet crying/being nasty did you have to cut out for the video to ONLY be 13 minutes??!!?
2:50 me eating food
cermet is just expressing what we all are thinking on a daily basis about life lol
What zodiac signs are your dogsss Kerm must be a sensitive cancer 😂
I like this dog. He's weird like me.
I owned an elderly dog. As she got older, she became deaf and blind rather suddenly. It made her have a lot of anxiety, and she'd cry whenever she couldn't feel or sense your presence, she'd cry for her breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she'd cry if her skin issues flared up, she'd cry if the wind was strong, basically, she'd cry all day long. This amount of whining and crying would have been a quiet day for my dog. I loved her so much.
Kermit reminds me of the Uncle I wasn't allowed to sit next to at family dinner
13 consecutive minutes of nasty ASMR... NASMR if you will 
(Nay- S M R)
We love them why?
I love the strange sad lung.
you should wash kermit with the products you use to wash yourself 😂
This is Jenna marbles ? I never watched her videos until now
Can't wait to see the horror edits of this
My favorite part is when he started licking your feet
This made me so anxious
I think Kermit is just depressed.
That echo location though,
Kermit: breathes 
Everyone: nasty
Oh my god his crying is giving me anxiety
Kermit is literally my spirit animal And as for my gender I identify as a nastiboi. As a nastiboi my religion falls under the category of the church of Irish Spring 🧼🧼🍀🧼💒🧼🌊🧼🧼  we nastibois are very very very religious and we cry very very loudly when we worship the holy soapy spirit. The diet of a nastiboi consists of nothing but chicken 🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗 and greenies bones 🦴. Being a nastiboi isn’t all fun and games we nastibois have very sensitive bodies meaning we need constant attention or we will cry, we need constant food or we will cry, we need constant hot things or we will cry, even things tht nastibois are not allowed to have we must have or we will cry, things tht are being offered to us....we do not want and when u offer the things we don’t want to us we cry. Loving a nastiboi is completely one sided meaning you must love us unconditionally but we only tolerate you conditionally. If you want a nastiboi to hate u then put clothes on them because we are sure to attack you if this is done. I am nastiboi, ALL HAIL KERMIT “starts to worship by crying”
god, he eats like he's never had a meal before. i feel that.
N A S T Y
Kermit sounds like me when I'm on my period...
Kermit asmr when?
I could not finish this video the first time trying to watch it. I still can't the 2nd time
i feel like kermit needs a therapist
3:22 gets me every time 😂😂😂
Guys I can’t like the video the like button is blue!!!!
and kermit was left with blue balls
You need a pet psychic to know why TF Kermit is crying
He has the sadness of a thousand souls in his eyes.
Cermets crying makes me so anxious
Kermit is so cute 🥺
He do a chomp
👁👅👁
Cement is the reason we have high co2 levels
I thought I wanted a dog until I watched this
um, can we just talk about how Cermet humped multiple dogs at the park?
Kermits cry sounds like my dog charlies cry :o
I got clickbaited, this is only 13 minutes, where's the rest of the 23 hours and 47 minutes
that pomeranian at the dog park was like a million times out of Kermit's league and he knew it
The best part of this video was Jenna chopping up Marble's food on the floor like a Benihana chef.
Can you make a whole video dedicated to finding marble the perfect bowl to eat out of? we never get any marble screen time.
Bites foot 

... That's my foot....
Kermit looks like Sheldon Cooper...
I'm not gonna lie but I used to have a dog that would cry as much as kermit and drool when he wanted food too like who knew I had a crying animal before watching jenna marbles
My dog cries a lot too but this is on another level
Jenna: don't eat it so fast in one bite, you're going to throw up
Carmeat: *eats it in one bite and as fast as he can because he wants to throw up*
No dog is nasty 😤 apart from attacking dogs
3:26 Im starting to think that dogs like the taste of foot sweat or any type of sweat
I wonder how funny it would be if his legs were surgically removed and he just sat there more useless than he is. LOL
My cat was very worried when the cermet was creying
I think your pet raisin has an anxiety disorder
God he’s an emotional wreck, I thought i handled it badly but jesus kermit is a mess
Reminds me of the dog I grew up with
Dobby loves you
absolutely no one:

Kermit: .........😦😧😨😭😭😭🐀
Kermit gotta go.
Can we get a part two?
I honestly think Kermit just likes to cry
KERMIT ASMR LIKE IF YOU WANT JENNA DO TO THAT
I'm kind of surprised this video didn't get demonetized for being so NASTY
Kermit is troubled by his thoughts 
Kermit: look at meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee now
I would have a mental breakdown daily if I had a dog like Kermit
Kermit is one nasty boi
my cat LOVES this video
is everyone just going to ignore that Kermit just had a threesome at the puppy park
Snoop dogg
3:26 is the funniest part
I LOVE ALLL your dogs and live to hear Kermit cry & act nasty.  Ohhhh that nasty Boy who literally looks like a MeerKat at times.
100 layers of nasty
why is he so weird. i love him and would do anything for him. but his mannerisms are so..... odd
Did you try feeding him on fine China
Kermit is so nasty 😔 Smh
seeing kermit in jenna's shirt made me unexpectedly emotional and nostalgic
Yesssssssss.   Ssst
Kermit crying sounds like a dry pencil eraser being used
Someone please auto tune him crying so I can feel them lyrics
.3.
Nobody: 


Julien: *heavy breathing*
"stop it" legit looks like a professional piece of art wtf
Julien has a good eye for colour combintations.
“I think I’m gonna stop...after I do this.” jump cuts to entirely different painting
The more concentrated Julian gets the heavier his dad breathing gets😂
Do splatter painting, where you just fling paint or flick it off of a brush.
Jena: wHaT D0 YoU hAVe?
Jullian: a KnIF3!
Jena: n0!
You know what? This inspired me to bust out my art kit, and.. and look at my art stuff for a bit..

And then put it back away
literally no one:
no a single soul:
jenna: i love the texture
As someone who is autistic and very sensitive to sound, I can say that this video was super fun and relaxing to watch/listen to.
Dollar tree sells little canvases for 1$ a piece btw.
I love how positive they both are to eacjh other, its just constant complments. Im in love with it!
"I don't know what I'm doing" - Every artist ever
Jenna: wants to be an artist
Julien: effortlessly makes art
Julien is a trans ally confirmed
Jenna: "Isnt this part of art though? Is figuring out when to stop?"
Me: "Yes Jenna, that is the only part of art."
Next art project use your boyfriend's face as a canvas
The scrapey scrape of that tool is a nice little ASMR bonus. That scratchy sound is super satisfying for some reason.
i love how they just hype each other up
0:12 proof that Wikipedia is not always a reliable source lol
"I think I'm gonna stop...after this"
Gasp
Doesn't stop
Y'all should try pottery and throwing pots.
juliens looked like the trix yogurt i used to eat
Nobody: 
Jenna: I LiKe tHe tExTuRe
"Goodbye I am very tall" : The prequel to I wanna be tall
Hey. I'm not sure what you did with it.




But I really think you should...

Hang it this way.
No one:
Jenna: I love the texture
Julien is breathing so heavily 😂
:( they’re so supportive of each other it’s so wholesome
jenna and julien:
 - wholesome
 - talented
 - love each other
 - vegan
 - caring about the earth
 - talented
 - funny
 - love their pets with their whole hearts combined
 - not controversial
 - talented
 - actually the best people on youtube
 - dont do what the whole of youtube wants them to do, do what they find fun or entertaining, which everyone loves anyway because they're jenna and julien
 - talented
Pollock is QUAKING

Edit: I LOVED this video. It was really relaxing. #aries
Here's
some
advice


_ for italics _
- crossthrough -
* for bold which probably most people knew *
Loving the way "Stop It" turned out. 😍
most youtubers: do one bob ross video 
jenna: explore every type of painting on the internet
My favorite part of all their videos together is that they're soo supportive of each other and compliment everything they do.
jesus jenna you are so aries with the knife strokes i almost had a heart attack
The calm aries energy Julien is emitting in this is both so calming and so terrifying
Omg you should try out knitting! Especially those complicated patterns, they can be confusing as hell 🤣
They’re always so supportive of each other it makes me happy
I really think that she shops re-name her channel “bein a 32 year old lady”
Pleaseeeeee make more painting videos, bc your soooooo good and I love your paintings, even tho in all good ways you guys are loud, it’s just so soothing and calming.💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕 PLEASSEEEEE DO MOREEEEEE
I'm a thirty year old lady & I have to say, 
A sleeping child, a glass of wine & crazy ass JENNA MARBLES! 
HELLLLL YEAHH! 😘❤
You can literally sell these for money. I would buy one.
We stan a man that confidently grabs the pastel pink
Cermit gets his heavy breathing gene from Julien
No one:
Literally no body:
Not a single soul: 
Jenna:I  a m  a  v i r g o
I could walk into a home decor store and see something exactly like that for 300$
WHY THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
I love how supportive they are of each other. ❤ So fucking cute
“I can do it. I can stop.” 
“I can do it. I can stop.” 
“I can do it. I can stop.” 


“ShOuLd I pUt AnOtHeR cOlOr HeRe???”
Now I'm hungry for rainbow sherbet. Lol
adds black it is your DOWN FALL jenna 😂
the one y’all did together legit looks like your personalities colliding 🖤
Hang it
This way
Put Julien's side on the left
Jenna and Julian switch zodiac signs for 14 minutes and 22 seconds
I love this video!! This is amazing! I would love another!! Also, I think you should hang it this way.
Kermit: Wow, what an pretty picture but it need to be prettier. Oh I know it needs a paw print. Paint come here.
Who would legit pay them money to buy one of the paintings
"Stop It" is legit amazing, I would buy that.
“I can stop!” .5 milliseconds later 
“Should I add another color here?”
boi Julien breathes so loud
I actually love this.. So relaxing x
The Scrapy scrape sound make my whole body recoil but the arts are worth it
"not only can I do it, but I can stop"

Adds more colors
I loved Julie's first pastel drawing so much, the color palette gave me life
“Jenna Marbles comes out as bi with abstract paint”
the sounds on the big canvas!! i could feel it in my bones!! 😖😖😖😫😫😂
They're so lovely to each-other it makes my heart warm
I love how these videos always turn into them hyping each other up. They are so HEALTHY
12:40
boyfriend?????? i thought u guys were just friends!!!!!!!!!!!
It's easy until you try to do a pallet knife painting of a dragon fruit on a small canvas. But, anyways, both of yours look so good! Definitely hang "Stop It," Jenna!
"Art fear" How tf did you describe one of my anxieties regarding crafts?!
Everyone else:


My ocd at 2:59: ogajackoogaoogaaaaa here I come!
Jenna: “I can do it. And I can stop.” 

5 seconds later

Jenna: “Should I put another color here?”
Hang it this way it will look amazing with both you creations that way 😂
Oil paint is really hard, even if you aren’t a beginner
I think I like the painting with Julien's half either to the left side or on the bottom.
I got mad ASMR from this
14 minutes of Jenna and Julian saying “I LOVE THE TEXTURE”
julien’s heavy breathing gives me asmr tingles
For some reason, watching this really helped my anxiety. Thank you 💖
Hey just hang it this way, ok?
... 

I need to get out my watercolors again
"i can stop"

moments later

"SHOULD I PUT ANOTHER COLOR HERE"
More of this please! Turned out really great, i hope you hang the art up for your guests to see. 

Much love!
julien's first painting said trans rights
DO A DOGS PAINTING CONTEST 
PAINT YO DOGS AND COMPETE BEEEECH
Omg stop it was incredible!!!
This is the calmest I've ever seen Julien and tbh it scares me
no one:
julian while painting : loud breathing
Them: doing something bold
Me: Heavy inhale
I see a man in his painting 6:24
Hang it this way ⬆⬅➡↗↖↘↙🔀↩⤴⤵⏬⏫▶◀⏩🔼
please paint a portrait of your dogs
After the last piece dried, it reminded me of the narrow stairs album cover by death cab for cutie
I had a face mask on and I'm trying to stay still but I can't stop laughing lol
My favorite thing about the art series is how supportive of each other that they are ❤️❤️❤️
Hang it this way. I think it looks really pretty this way
I feel like I'm watching my parents try out different hobbies. I support yall
Why does Julian breath so heavy 🤔😂
You guys should try wheel throwing! It would be a nightmare for Jenna though, it's very messy and "Aries" like.
You guys are so supportive of each other! REAL LOVE!
This type of stuff I should look in to for my anxiety thank you Jenna for posting this ❤️
you guys should stick paint filled balloons on a canvas and pop them with darts
Plz plz plz make a like 2 hour art video because this is so nice
Nobody:
Jenna: tExtUrE
Me: whereiscamerawhereiscamerawhereiscamerawhatthefuck
I loved the “Stop it” painting the most 👏🏻😂
Im slightly drunk and painting while i watch this, and i am so relaxed and having the best time. I love these videos
The more concentrated Julian gets the heavier his dad breathing gets😂
Ima call the first one sickness
8:10 I keep replaying that part 

Keep ya head down
watching them support each other and lift each other up is the wholesome content i came for
One of my plants is named Bjork
Jenna: "I started off strong, but then my 'too much' gene kicked in"
Jenna: *adds more*
I didn’t just splatter paint, I was my paint
10:28 I love it 

I would honestly buy that, like I want it your so good at this 

I WANNA TRY
These look amazing!
there needs to be a video where you both switch zodiac signs for a day !!! 😂 this video is a sample of what it would be 😂🥳🥳
It’s just nice to watch you both have a good time, quality content.
julien. are you ok? you’re breathing a little heavy honey. genuinely concerned.
I kinda hope the hung it this way. It looks like a beach! Yknow, when it’s getting dark and the waters all pretty and has a orange-ish hue, and everything becomes 10x prettier!
Hang it this way
Not sure which way, I'm sick, but I want to help
I am just letting you know the 3D parts/ texture is called impasto 🥰😘❤️💖 I love you so much you are you favourite YouTube ever and I watch your videos over and over and I still can’t stop laughing you and Julien are just the best 💖😘❤️🥰😘🥰😍
You two just supporting each other is honestly great.
I love doing these. Theyre so fun
Because of this, I am now a 30year old lady doing this project
Hang it this way:






The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues
Okay but Julien has talent
The sound of the knife scraping against the canvas is making me cringe so hard
Check out the description box under this video your welcome🙃
Jenna: I am a Virgo ♍️ with confidence. Me: claps loudly oh hell yeah. Btw I’m a Virgo 😁😁
A whole minute and 42 seconds of Julien just being quiet in the beginning. Well, sorta....
Julian's paintings were low-key really good wtf lol
NO, hang it THIS way.
Am I the only one who thinks this is ASMR...







PROBABLY....
Such an Aries thing-I completely get how he experienced it
KeEP yO HEaD dOwN
tea is that jenna still being relavant in 2019 is a REAL blessing because her content only gets more wholesome and BETTER god bless thank you
Keep on going with it! I recommend trying pastels next! 

But seriously these are great and inspiring to an artist on a hiatus!
Nobody: 

Jenna: i just like the ~~*texture*~~
Jenna in the first one: 
“Am I doing art Julian?”
Me:
No you’re making a bi pride flag
watching Julien make art is incredibly satisfying
You guys are the live example of "art should disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed"
You should SELL these!!
I’d spend a lot just because you did it! 😊
Julien breathing ASMR😂
I am so proud of the both of you for experimenting with art! I'm inspired to try a new medium! I don't have the money but I'm still inspired!!!
Please try watercolor painting!!
Virgo level: watercolor pencils
Aries level: palettes, paints and all
I freaking love how you guys are hyping each other's paintings up. It's the cutest thing ever!
Julien please stop breathing so heavily oh my god
“Stop it” is amazing!!
Artists have a special kind of too much gene where they just somehow,,,,, make it work 

Source: me
I related to that taking ground balls things SO HARD OMG
J & J's Ratchet Museum
Jennaaaaaa 
Please do a watercolor or gouache painting!!!! 

Also it clearly should be hanging this way
@JennaMarbles can you attempt to paint your dogs.
I am a virgo and I can stop. . . . .should I put another colour here?!?!?!😂😂
You two are so fun to watch.  And, AND, your art pieces really did turn out well.   "hang it this way."
julien breathes like a dad like if you agree lmao
“I am a Virgo with confidence!”
You should try spray paint art and you should try to make a galaxy.....ps. Love u guys☺️
So pretty! Hang it this way!
"stop it" is legit my fave
"i can do it and i can stop"
ten seconds later 
"should i put another color here?"
Pls do more art videos ♥️
i love the way they cheer each other on omg
I've watched all of your videos so many times I have a j&j addiction
I'm LOVING these art videos! They're so funny and I love seeing what you create!
jenna: yelling stop it and hitting the board with a knife

me: what a relaxing painting video
Nobody:

Jenna: I love the texture
You should try spray paint art!!!
I would buy Juliens, he has a talent for this.
I hate to be that guy... But I'm fairly sure this is non-representational art... Not abstract...

I haven't taken an art class in a while so correct me if I'm wrong

Edit: 
Julien: [[HEAVY BREATHING]]
I watch this video every night to relax before bed. As an artist it's so relaxing and comforting to watch. 💖💖
This one is called "Stop it" 😂👌
14 minutes of you both being each other’s hype person
My too much gene ruined it 😂😂
Everyday of life
i’ve never actually felt like julien knows what he’s doing until today
i love yalls art! if y’all would like i have some helpful tips on how to create a more controlled piece so you can have more confidence in your strokes. My first tip would be to have a set idea in your mind, think of what you want it to look like before you put it on the canvas. It may be less spontaneous, but you have a more predicted result. My second tip is to stop after every couple of strokes, and step back to look at the piece. Really evaluate it, see what you like and see what you could add to it. My third tip would be to remember values and position on the canvas. depending on where you put your strokes and your colors, your piece can look a lot different. 
I hope this helps ! you guys are so creative !
“I’m just gonna start little and work my way up” 

That quote is basically her dogs.
“I am a Virgo with confidence” 😂
People! I was really confused on how they pretty much switched zodiac signs so I did some research. Turns out, people with more active signs (ares) tend to be more relaxed and controlled when doing art related things and mellower signs (Virgo) tend to be more bold when doing art as a way of expressing their built up energy
Nobody: 

Julien: audibly inhales
This was some very good asmr!!
“Stop it” looked incredible!!
“Let’s play Bach in the background and it’ll be classy AF.”
The one at 7:59 is my favorite!!!

What are your favorites???
I've been painting for over 5 years and Julien has an undeniable natural talent
Nobody: 

Jenna: I love the texture
yOu Should HaNg It ThIs WaY
actually frickn loves Stop It
Julien and Jenna were so supportive in this video my heart melted
Daaamn Julien's abstract works are REALLY good!
I feel the art fears they be scary! But you doing great!!👍
You should hang it this way
Julien has such an eye for colour. Im genuinely very impressed
It's weird, it's like once you give Julien the option of chaos, he rebels against it 😂😂
I'm nine and also an Aries and I have a very hyper personality and this somehow calmed me
hang it this way.


I'm not a Virgo


I'm not a Aries


I'm an Aquarius
I remember when I found his channel and I tried an abstract painting.. It didn't go well.😞
These low key videos are always the best
I desperately want Jenna to try doing special effects makeup. Like a glam and gore style thang
I like how hard julien is breathing but only when he’s painting
like 4 real HaNG It ThiS WaY
Im with an aries. Omg. They drive u nuts. But some goor d
Honestly I love all of juliens like they're beautiful
Julien low key finding his hidden talent. I'd hang up that pink white and black one.
that was the cutest thing ever 
this ones called ... stahp it!
i love how julien dad breathes when he's focused
I love how julien is such a mouth breather 😂 in the literal term of he breathes solely from his mouth and loudly 😂😂🤷🏻‍♀️
They should try spray gun painting! 🎨
“I’m a Virgo and I can stop”
Should I put another color here?
Tip: don't mix colors that are the opposite in the color wheel (ex. Red and green, blue and orange) or they will end up doing a brownish color
I’m yelling at my phone
“STOP JENNA STOP!!”
😮😍👏👏👏👏🙌👍💞🎨 (and I'm an artist so it means something since I've seen ALOT of art!)
julien looking mildly scared for 14 minutes
Stop it is freaking gorgeous
Not digging the sound of scraping but love the video so I watched it twice. Lol
I love the paintings they kickass
Stop It looks really good 👍
I am EXTREMELY impressed by Julian's paintings holy crap. He's a bit of a wild card at times so I feel like abstract, go with your immediate instinct kind of painting is perfect for him lol
I actually really love how the first one turned out!😍
Julien, I'd just like to thank you for stopping when you did on your first painting. I know NOTHING about art but yours looks so good and is something I'd hang in my house. 

Jenna, kudos to you for having the guts to keep trying these art styles even when they don't work out. I once tried attending a paint nite (where you go and follow an instructor to create a painting) and I immediately got stressed and ended up getting drunk and angrily painted a night sky, vowing to stick to logical activities that don't drive me to drink.
GIrl that Stop It one is so freaking awesome I'd buy that
Can you please do more art!!
I'm surprised Julien's heavy breathing didn't dry the paint faster
Hang it this way
"Stop It" is suchhhh a nice painting 💓💓💓💓
im DYING your too much gene
Man I really want to try this. I really like the silver one that Julian did.
“I’m a confident Virgo and I can stop.”
“ SHOULD I PUT ANOTHER COLOR HERE?? “
13:16 aries mode activated
I love "Stop it!", it's so pretty!
You guys could gesso it next canvas so it doesnt soak up so much paint, and get thick acrylic medium for more texture.👌👌
one of my favorite things is Jenna doing things she enjoys and sharing it with us, thanks for honestly just being a person to sit down with 💕
One of the most enjoyable parts of your videos, Jenna, is that you clearly do the things that you want to do, and have heaps of fun while doing them. And just that is kisses fingertips Good Content; happiness is hard to fake and you're so genuine all the time.

What I'm trying to say is, don't apologize for making art, or for Me Time. You do you.
also plz do more painting videos i absolutely love these
I was having a sad time trying to fall asleep tonight, and this video comforted me and made me laugh. Thank you 🧡
Hang it this way 

_______
| ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) |
—————
Julien that first one is GORGEOUS
Can we all just talk about how dope their  relationship is? Jenna does some simple  painting stuff and Juliens like "whoa that's amazing!"  "I love that we should hang that one up in the house!" Everyone needs a Julien.
Stop looks freaking beautiful!!!
When she put down the yellow on the first painting I winced! But she got soooo goood by the end!
"My too much gene kicked in" omg I feel that 😂
HANG IT THIS WAY
Jenna: adds black
Me: the too-much gene is about to kick in
Jenna: it needs brightness
Me: here we go
3:48 looks like a bumblebee flew full force into your art.
😍💖💗🐶🌾😎👍🙌🐕 love crafts, plants and animals.  NEW SUBSCRIBER..
I love your painting videos! These are great :)
6:47 Jenna making the Instagram logo
I know nothing about art but Julien is like...full blown artist, that stuff looked so professional and like you'd see it in an art gallery
I would legit hang stop it on my wall - it's beautiful!
Ok does Julien never hold the camera because I never notice the breathing😂😂😂
OH OH I KNOW! 
Hang it this way
unpopular opinion but i'm thinking you should hang it this way
Sooooo... is “stop it” for sale? I stinking love it! 💙💙💙
“Take the confidence I’m giving you,you young grasshopper”6:30
You should do spray paint art next
Julien is actually an artist ok woah
jenna has finessed the entire youtube system. she could literally post a video of her watching a kitchen tap drip for 15 minutes and i would still watch every second. she can make absolutely anything enjoyable
Fun tip! When you're using canvases, if you paint the sides, it really adds a completed look to the paintings 😁
drink every time she says the word "texture"! 😂😉
"Relaxing art video" horrible scratching noises
I actually think you should hang it that way with the dimensions 🧐🧐
Watching Jenna’s videos makes me less scared about turning 30
10:26 - It's not 'stop it', it's 'stAHp it"
i cant see it fully


can u zoom out a bit?
I SO would buy "Stop It" if it were for sell  $1000 easy
MORE ARt VIDEOS plEASEEE
Wow, she's so tall that the camera couldn't even capture all of her.
Please do more painting!!!!
STOP IT was probably my favorite
Definitely 
Hang it this way
6:53 😂 has me dying!!! <3!
Julien mouth breathing while doing art is my 2019 mood
Awe I’m a Virgo ♍️ and my hubby is an Aries ♈️
its like they switched
The painting that you worked together on looks like a beach 🏖
If you want more texture, you should add impasto medium to the paint. It helps it be more 3D after drying.
Julien is surprisingly good at this.
ok was it just me, but the last painting they did together (if the left was the bottom and the right was the top) it low key looked like  an abstract sort of beach during a sunset
THANK GOD that julien didn’t go aries on his first piece
will Smith voice awwhhissat 😂😂😂
Please do more there beautiful
''Stop it'' is beautiful .
Hang it this way [||||] (not [=])
sell them at a garage sale and stencil inspirational words like dream over the great textured colors you did
Julien’s first piece looks like that trix yogurt from my childhood 😋
Hang it this way.
I high key would hang juliens paintings in my room
Hang it this way.
Love that I'm 12 years old but when I watch ur vids I feel like I'm a 32 year old lady as well
I LOVE THE FIRST TWO
The "Stop it" painting is actually really nice.I mean I genuinely love it!
Jenna: turns 30 and subconsciously promotes art therapy 🙌🏼
idk who breathes more kermit or julen in this video
i love how much they hype each other up all the time
There All So Good! Love them
"DONT LAUGH AT ME ART PEOPLE OKAY YALL WOULD BE SCARED IF I CLOMPED NEXT TO YOU AT 6'11 AND BOWLED YOU UNDER THE TABLE" - Jenna 2019
jenna and julian hyping up each other's' painting is what i needed today.
another reason not to go to the gym and instead work out at home: i couldnt watch ~~~32 year old laaaadyyyy~~~ doing beautiful aesthetic things at the gym
The «stop IT» was actually really really good
Julien needs to start his own oil painting channel, it’ll be an asmr thing 😂
Hang it this way! 






I had to.
Great paintings! Ten Julien's heavy breathings out of ten!
Omg it's like nails on a chalk board
The amount of genuine joy I get from these videos are ridiculous
Hang it this way
(Orange part at the bottom)
Welcome back to “being a 32 year old lady”



Uhmm 




Okay.... Jenna
The canvas one reminds me of the cover art on a Death Cab for Cutie album. <3
No one: 
Julian:
Jenna: sToP iT.
11:11 r.i.p headphone users
For real though, "Stop it" is a dope piece of art
Do portraits of each other next time with the knives! Or whatever you want. But a portrait would be awesome even if it’s stressful


Oh my gosh, I just commented something I thought would be cool. I didn’t think about 2k people would agree with me
It's a bumble bee 🐝 on a pretty flower.
“It needs a little bright spot” “maybe if I add a little white”
Nononono put that sentence back in your mouth
the use of gestural abstraction in "STOP IT" really makes some sort of unutterable emotion and human-ness  like, come off the canvas. i just. i like it so much
elmo lookin like a snacc tonight
Honestly I love the art
Jenna's first one, is quite literally me when I'm doing my art
STOPPP ITTTTTT legit tho, "stop it" looks like it should be in a museum
hang it this way 

(red top and yellow bottom )
"I think you should-What's that one called again?"
"Stop it."
"Yeah."
I can stop








 😂
I love how mutually supportive they are.
The way they hype up each other 😍
how about y'all hang it this way.
You two constantly hyping each other up is literally GOALS
Julian’s side of the canvas was like WOAH real art
I SWEAR JULIEN IS BREATHING MORE THEN KERMIT
hang it this way
Watching this video is really interesting to me. My brother and I both are very artistic and while we're drawing or painting, we become very focused. I never really noticed until I was watching Julien and seeing how creating art can help people focus. Anyway, great video and I'm about to to go buy some art knives!
Please paint a family portrait of you, Julian and the dogs
1:25 🤣😂🤣 Julian’s face is the best.
what i love about this is the support from each of you. goals
I love how hard Julien breathes when he paints 😂
i was expecting julien to aries all over this video lmao
Julien out here breathin like a serial killer
every time she put another layer before drying the last i was like damn she just asking for brown
Did these with my boys, thanks for the video and idea!
From 0:00-1:32 Julian was either high or dreading EVERYTHING
Paint kermit the frog and kermit the dog.
*insert heavy julien breathing*
this relationship is so pure and i am living
My husband is an Aries and I NEED to do this with him!
Jenna's painting "STOP IT" is my favorite! Good job Jenna, very original!
No one:
Jenna:
I lOvE tHe TeXtUrE
Juliens secret talent is definitely ABSTRACT ART
6:20 it looked like a transgender flag
6:05 Julien said "trans rights" thru this painting
yaw siht ti gnah stuj yltsenoh
omg I'm an insane Aries and have the exact same style as Julien
I love how throughout his whole video they’re both supporting making each other feel good about themselves and their art abilities
i feel like "stop it" should be "staawp it"
I love the “stop it” piece! Real art!
julien's breathing is so relaxing to listen to imo.
No one:
Jenna: I love the texture!
Everyone needs this 32 year old lady content in their life
Aww I love how they hype each other up!
STOP IT was the best piece
Any other artists out there physically dying everytime they mixed colors that you just knew would become muddy and yOU JUST WANTED THEM TO SUCCEED
Hang it this 
Way
By the way I really love "Stop it". I would hang it on my wall. And Julien's color choices are aesthetically pleasing.
Shurburt😂
9:36-9:39
Try taking a dance tutorial!!
I WANT A MAN LIKE HIM!!!!!!!
If you want a lot of texture why not add fine-grit sand in the paint? It actually works btw. I have sand-paint on my walls.
I actually really like “Stop it!”
Why is she all about zodiac signs and being 32?sorry this is the first video I’ve ever watched of her😂
I want to see you and Julien do Spraypaint art.
Jenna’s paintings getting progressively bolder, and more sporadic- yet sensical in color and texture choice- as the video goes on? Poetic cinema.
Do abstract portraits that represent your dogs 😭
Jenna whipped out the black paint, and I was like "oh honey, no..." and then she put yellow on top of it, and I was like "OH, HONEY NO!"
Jenna you should paint but with condiments
14 minutes of scratching canvases
GOOD JOB GUYS 🤗👍😉
“I can do it, I can stop” keeps going
Y’all are turning into a couple’s art channel and I am 100% here for it
"stop it" was really pretty
you should try to hang it this way instead of that way
And yay we got a plant tour video..
You should try a crackle medium! It’s a mousse like medium that you mix with paint and it cracks when it dries and makes super cool texture!
in a way your videos are just so nice and pure, I love it!
Texture timestamps:

1:26
2:48
Hm....Aries therapy. Guess I'm buying a canvas, paint and a spatula today.
Youre 32 and still dont have kids?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Make new merch with "stop it" on it
Anyone else notice that in the corner (R bottom) Jenna's purple paint are looks like someone's profile?! They both did a BEAUTIFUL job! Love it😍💖
This was so relaxing to watch
ya merch link is broke
The way they encourage and reassure each other is adorable
Julien supporting and encouraging Jenna is just the cutest 😍
9:55 YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO STOP
I forgot I had a blank canvas somewhere and I gave it a shot for the hell of it. It didn't come out as planned, but I'm surprised by how soothing it was. Thanks for the sudden burst of inspiration. Now I'm off to Wal-Mart to load up on boards like a goblin.
I love that julien panted the trans plag 😂
it'll look the best if you hang it this way.
Abstract painting makes them switch personalities and I’m here for it
6:18 remind me of a child saying “I’m done” after finishing a drawing or like a painting and has made a huge mess and the mom has to pretend to be impressed with the trash that their child made XD


Good job though I actually really like the painting
My son has Autism and he LOVES any video where you do something we can kinda replicate. We have really been enjoying the art series so please keep it going! Finger paint, oil pastels, dot painting, I tried to follow a Blank's painting tutorial or anything else like that
You should hang it this way
Julien's face when she says she's sitting on the floor 🤣
“You go in with confidence and I think that’s something I could benefit from”
heavy breathing
I’m going out to buy paint, canvases and a palette knife and im going to decorate my whole house with these - I love these!
Hang it ..SIDE WAYS 😍😍😍
Hang it this way ⬅↕↪
Julian is breathing so hard.
“Stop It” actually looked really cool after it dried! You should hang it up somewhere Jenna! Have more confidence in your artistic abilities
Julien is actually really good at this.
Why is julian Breathing so heavy
looks like beautiful bumblebees in a field of flowers!!!
i live for her vine references
I would watch a second channel where Julien just does knife paintings.  He has a natural ability that is mind boggling.  I feel like I'm more of a Jenna where everything I attempt gets overdone and looks like poo.
stop it should have been called aries season
“Uh oh-“
julien dad breathing for 14:22
"iLoVeTheTEXture*
Jenna: this, right here... I love this
smears it around until it disappears
you should sell these on ebay. I will buy ALL of them
“I can do it I can stop!”

Literally not even a minute later

“Should I put another color here?”
Hang it THIS way
😂
"You just got to decide." Jenna
this one is called

STOP IT i’m wheezing
Idk why but Julians hair looks like Ronald McDonalds weave 😂😂😂
You shoudl try string painting!! Lay a string that is covered in paint on a canvas then drag it off.
Do more painting please
I don't know why, but Julian's first painting makes me think of those Gogurt tubes I would get as a kid XD!
It’s soo beautiful to see a 6’11 woman date a man who is 4’9 and be soo happy
Actually...it might look better this way...
2:48 that painting has bisexual power
julians paintings were actually really good
can julien make abstract paint asmr videos please
jenna : running through the house screeching

julien: aggressively points at painting 'stop it'
friendship goals!!! ugh this is so pure
How long have you been a 32 YEAR OLD LADIE
stop it is such a moving piece

i would buy it tbh
hang it this way
Send the “stop it” painting to Logan and jake Paul
No one:
Jenna: I have a fetish for painting textures
Hang it this way but make sure not to hang it this way
Try painting with alcohol ink next! So fun and almost impossible to mess up.
Julien’s heavy breathing relaxes my bitchy brain
I never know where this channel is going.... But I like what I see
what kind of ASMR is this?
Use Gesso in the canvas before painting. It acts as a primer for the canvas so the paints work better and the canvas won’t soak it up!
This way.
Tell Julien to stop dad breathing so hard, he sounds like kermit. Lmao
JENNA! I JUST REALIZED YOUR MIDDLE NAME IS MY NAME. AND MY MOM'S NAME IS JENNA
I love you in eve vs adam erb. So hottt
"I can do it, I can stop... should I put another color here?" Fantastic.
i have art fear, toooo! even though i love to draw! this video and you nailing it and having fun and loosing your art fear inspired me to use the same method and finally draw on my canvases instead of paper. thank youuuuuu!!! gonna make some sick paintings now, take a step away from my pencils towards my COLOOOOUUUURSSSS-A
No no no! Don’t hang it that way! Hang it THIS way
This video is so relaxing omg
I love how supportive Julian is!
JULIENS SECOND PRINTING IS SO GOOD
I’d buy “stop it”
Julien being a supportive boyfriend for 15 minutes




(Edit: I really didn't think I would get this many likes. Thanks!)
you should hang it this way
One way to add more texture and make it easier if you want to do this again is to use more paint, notice how it was easier the second time round
....this way
These paintings are AMAZING!!!!! I definitely could see them in an art Museum that's how Dope they came out!!!!!! I DEFINITELY would hang them up.... and I BET people will think they are bought expensive pieces! SERIOUSLY impressed!!!
The name of the last piece is called "Hang It This Way" 😂
Me when she puts on that yellow: “oh no you’re gonna regret that so fast” 

Jenna: one swipe later “uh oh”
I love how they are so supportive of each other
So i found that same guy on facebook and also found this type of painting very relaxing and i actaully paint paint.
When you added black on your first on, just stating is you shouldn't really jump tords black for dark, like it was purple so say use blue and work it darker. Also at least you didnt stop but you tried again and did so amazing! ALSO NO HAVE IT THAT WAY, Well maybe the other way with it a bit this way!
You should auction off your art for charity. There would be heaps of people who would buy a jenna original
that sound made me want to rip my hair out
Jenna:when your boyfriend uses your art against you. 
Everyone else: lol boyfriend. They just friends.
after you do the knife textured background you can go in with a thin brush and do a black outline of trees or buildings
That mand me go to sleep
For all his joking, you can totally tell Julien was raised by artists in the way he respects the medium.
WHY CAN HE NOT BREATHE
omg stop it looks so amazing i wanna buy it
I think you should hang it this way
Also Jenna don't be afraid of art, there are no rights and wrongs, only expression of what's going on with you right at that moment. Embrace it and love it, "flaws" and all! Kinda like self love
Julien breathes like such a dad .He dad breathes.
Hang it this way.
She loves the texture
“I can stop” literally doesn’t stop 😂😂 I love Jenna
I dig this art series. Give watercolor a try? I tried it today and it... wasn't....Teeeeeerrible...
Jenna- “I think it needs a bright spot on this black” 
Me-“oh no she’s gonna ruin it”
Jenna-“oh no I think I ruined it”
Hang it this way <^>
you should make an art gallery to hang up all your art and you could sell tickets  for millions so we can see it in person
7:58 if you yold me that was in an art show i would believe you
Julien needs to dye his hair 😂
Julien’s mouth breathing intensifies
I think you should hang it that one way
You should try gelli printing! Please try gelli printing. It is SO much fun!
Seeing Jenna get excited about stuff honestly makes me sooo happy, I just get all warm and fuzzy knowing she’s enjoying it.... I’m screaming 😊😆😆 e.g 2:17
I would totally hang "STOP IT" in my house.. anyone else?
Julien’s time-Out activity!  You need to carry a duffel of canvases, paint, and knives everywhere you go and break it out when he gets too Aries!  Hang vertically!
Gah, this series makes me miss painting and I want to get back into it now. 💖
the first minuet and a half is just Julian trying to hold back his Aries
I would buy this
Jenna Marbles Merch store but it's all just Jenna's art
I also expect julien to pick intense colors but he usually picks soft colors
Sell us your paintings and donate the money to an animal shelter...maybe?
You should try alcohol inks!!!
8:18 FACTS THAT WAS MY DAD TOO LMAOOO
Me throughout this entire video:

"JENNA JUST STOP. STOP IT. ITS BEAUTIFUL. TOO MUCH. NO. STOP IT."
Now she’s 7Ft LMFAOOOO
There’s your answer boom done 😂
Julien is such a dad breather
Henrg it thyhs wety
do that thing from the princess diaries where they pop paint balloons with darts over a canvas
the sound is so satisfying
You should paint more
Hang it... this way -->
I think this is Julian's calling
lol this should all be color theory and keeping the knife clean when switching areas as to not make brown
Okay but I want "Stop it"
at 7:23 I screamed "JENNA STOP"
6:49 ITS THE INSTAGRAM LOGO
I feel like julien breathes heavier than kermit
Julien's first one looks like the transgender flag lmao
Weird question, but Julian, bro do you have a deviated septum or breathing problems??? Cuz honestly the way you're panting makes me ANXIOUS for your health.
A couple that paints together, stay together.
hang it this way....🤠
Jenna painting ft Julian's heavy breathing 




OMG I LOVE YALL
I think it's funny that Jenna paints like an Aries and Julien paints as a Virgo. Or a Capricorn, any earth sign really.
Never in my life have I hated a sound while painting until now
I love how you guya are supporting each others painting
Wow juliens pastel painting looks good so far
Do a full face of makeup keeping the brush still and moving your face
Stop it is like my anxiety in a painting
No, but hang it this way
Julie’s first painting looks like trix yogurt
“Stop it” 😂
being a 32 year old lady is my favorite Wednesday procrastination vehicle.
If you look at it from juliens perspective up like a portrait it looks like the sky changing in the desert
Release your Etsy
Hang it with the red-orange at the right side horizontal ;P
Julien definitely gets his creativity and artistic eye from his mom 🙃
It really warms my heart seeing the way you two completely support and encourage each other :) It's so nice x
Do an acrylic swing pour
10:22 legit looks professional
my favourite part in these videos is how supportive they are with each other, love it
hang it this way
11:10 jenna is being so chaotic while julien is so slow and methodic,, what kind of alternate universe is this
i wonder if there is a picture wall mount that has a circle back and can spin, so you can rotate the last painting which ever way you feel like that day
hang it this way
hang it........

THAT WAY
hang it this way
when jenna becomes an aries and julien becomes a virgo it gets weird to watch
Aries: "Is this boring though?"
Bold of you to call it abstract art 😂
Hang it this way
Hang it like a collage on top of ur plant wall it will be a really good idea
when i am a 32 year old lady i hope i have the freedom to be just like u beeetch
Hang it this way (who else commented that when jenna said she would go crazy) (also 2019 anybody?)
Bad art.
Try watercolours next!
The only time Julien isn't a chaotic Aries lol
julien is breathing so heavy in this video kermit is quaking
Good thing with acrylic paint is that you can work in layers. Let one layer dry and then when you add something but mess up you can just take a tissue or a sponge and wipe it all off. Or you can just make happy mistakes :D
im not done yet but I love all of Juliens! like id love them in my house! lol and I love Jennas stop it!! gorgeous
they are soooo supportive of each other it makes me wanna cry
shes so supportive skskskksskskksksksks
jenna....please make a blanket fort for a video. you know we all made those as a kid but now we have ADULT resources and hands
Hang it this way 💀
I like how you have an awkward face in every single video
you should really really really hang it this way🙂
me. an arter. sees jenna adding yellow over wet black. oh. oh no.
jenna and julien encouraging each other is my favorite thing
6:05 looks like trix yogurt
His looked like the trix yogurt
Hang it this way□
Iy could be an abstract mountun
I’m obsessed with how positive and encouraging you are to each other
I love how she said “I’m a Virgo and I can stop” and then she put another color at the bottom😂
Did anyone get distracted because of juliens heavy breathing on his first one (sorry if i spelt his name wrong)
Hang it this way!
“Bye I’m very tall and have to leave”. 

Ever since she became 6’11”, she’s been such a busy 32 year old lady.
Get you a man who hypes you up
Omg jennas third painting is really good too
At 8:01 I thought of Instagram
Julien is breathing so hard
Just a suggestion that will probably get  lost in the comments, but Jenna. Can you auction your art pieces that you decide not to keep and put up on your own walls and donate all the takings to different charities of your choice. I know that I personally would love a Jenna or Julian original on my wall. :D Love you guys
2:17 😆
You need to hang it on a diagonal
is no one going to mention the fact that for the first half of the first painting is the bi flag.
I’m very tall 
I have to leave
"stop it" after drying is pretty cooool
Okay but like... are they in the house??? :) can we seeeeee
It would be real cool to see you two go take art classes!!
hang it this way!!!! it's prettier :(
*Juliens dad breathing in the mic *
julien’s shirt means snitch in danish
When julien said that Jenna was doing art the noise she made was so cute I almost criedddddd — 2:17
Beautiful. Looks like sunset at the beach!
“Stop it” was dope
plz fill a bald cap with googly eyes and then also glue googly eyes to your face so you’re just googly eyes from the neck up. i think that would be very nice
Drinking game, take a sip every time Jenna talks about the texture
you should hang it this way
Hang it this way😂
Welcome to Jenna’s ratchet asmr
The encouragement between the 2 of you's is just dope, I love it!
it’s so great how they’re so supportive over their things 😂
But like when are they gonna get married
Hang it this way 😊
what is that description i-
I cried when she talked about her new Wikipedia height tht was amazing
I haven't painted in ages and I want to do this.
Did the sounds irk anyone else
Stop it is my favourite
“Stop it!” Is SO COOOOOLLLLLL I WANT IT!!!!!!!
Jenna:I. AM. A. VIRGO. WITH. CONFIDENCE.

Me: I. AM. A. VIRGO. WITHOUT. CONFIDENCE.
Hang it this way 😂
im a leo :D
Hang it this way julien (sorry Jenna for triggering you)

Hang it the way you guys first put it up to show us how it looked
Hang out this way!!
Open an Etsy shop




Now
Juliens colors choices are so aesthetically pleasing. I love me some pastel.
get married already guys ;)
You should put quotes over the ones you don’t like and hang it up
high key would buy these
When you wave the other way there’s no glitter.
*Jenna loving the texture for 14 minutes and 21 seconds*
I needed exactly this
Hang it THIS way :D
I wish it was an arial shot instead of a perspective it’s hard to see the overall look and colors
Stop it is my favorite!!!
Hang it... tHIs way.
I feel like they switched personalities 😂 Julien normally would go with the neon colors, but instead Jenna did. Julien went for the pastels. I love the purity of this video. Doing art for what it’s meant for, enjoyment.
this one is called...... STOP IT
Your sooooo goood
hang it this way
Should sell them
you  should try origami
I’ll do this for JULIEN (put it this way)
Y does Julian breath so heavy when he was painting 😂😂😂❔❓❔❓⁉️also Jenna I'm a ♍
To hell with merch! sell the painting(s) you don't want to keep or eBay auction them with the money going to yourself or a doggo charity!
#virgoclubbbbbb!!! August 23
If you don't want the canvas to soak up the paint then prime it with gesso beforehand.
someone make a compilation of jenna's too much gene
Future tip! Use a white wash (white with water) on the canvas first (with a big brush) and let dry before painting! Helps with that “soaking up” issue :)
DO SPRAY PAINT ART NEXT
J+J SAY TRANS RIGHTS
See I watch these because of how supportive they are of each other.
Juilen breathing vs Kermit breathing

                  Who will win?
You guys should try selling paintings for charity
“stop it” looks like a la croix can
Hang it this way
Hang it this way 😜
Hang it THIS WAY☝🏻👇🏻🤜🏻✌🏻🖖🏻🖕🏻💋
Can I buy stop it???
I feel like in this video, Jenna's inner Aries explodes out in an uncontrollable burst - and Julien embraced the calm and controlled Virgo that he never knew existed within him.
hey, y’all should hang it this way
Drink every time Jenna says texture
How is it that Julian is so erratic and frankly a safety hazard in the kitchen and then is,, super chill when it comes to art??
Julien breathes like my pug
Hang it this way.
lol what help
Julien's painting at 9:00 looks like abstract kermit
I just love how they support each other
this is so interesting bc jenna's paintings were very chaotic but julian's were very controlled
Ok but lets julien do this,,,,,,,,,, with a k i t c h e n k n i f e
I was at my friends house and out of no where she said “ when I have a child I will name it Kermit.” And I was like omg you like Jenna too. And then she said I don’t know who that is but I mean Kermit the frog. And then I remembered she is obsessed with him (everything that she has is Kermit the frog).    Oh and by the way if you ever do a meet and great bring Kermit, I am sick but I feel like the only thing that is making me feel better is Kermit. He is a beautiful thing that has been brought to the world.
Jenna most of the time canvases need to be primed with a gesso! It makes the surface smoother and will make things easier to push around! I know you said oils aren't for you, but they make water-based oils which are just as easy to use and clean as acrylic and has a thicker smoother texture to it which makes using palette knives a bit easier! Also using a smaller and more flexible palette knife will make things easier!
hey Jenna i think you should hang the painting this way >:)
Julien’s breathing is almost as heavy as Cermet’s in this video damn Darth Vader
6:04 julian says trans rights.
Squeak toy intros are for 32 year old ladies too
Hang it this way.

9:11

Julien: “You are taller AND what”
Everyone praise Jenna for having a straight face for that whole intro
Jenna: Am I taller or what?


Julien: You're taller... and what
can i get a hell yeah
CAN I GET A HELL YEAH
CAN I GET A HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!
“Fix it I’m a Virgo” 
  my new slogan
Welcome back to: Jenna successfully doing what she wants
Jenna: CAN I GET A HELL YEAH

me at 2am sitting on the toilet in the dark
When you're not tall enough to ride the rollercoaster
Me: needs to get work done


Also me: watches video for the 12th time for the awesome intro
Imagine the historians from the future analyzing this video
She's finally tall enough for her basketball game tomorrow
Gotta say, I'm moved by the whole gospel choir intro.
"Oh bish I already feel like a triceratops bish" 

I'M DEAD😂😂😂😂
"What's the matter you don't like Fur Elise?"😂😂😂
the first 2 minutes of her singing was just so funny for some reason lol
“Am I tall or what?”

“You’re tall AND what”
Better look than most of the outfits at the 2019 Met Gala
Ok but the churchy music in a little nook and the vehement vibes make it look like she's worshipping the degrees on the wall that she doesn't use and that's a real millennium society vibe
She looks like Angelica’s doll Cynthia from Rugrats
"As you can see a part of being tall is constantly being on the phone" 😂
aries being afraid of power for 14 minutes straight.
Shout to Jenna for never being clickbait
Dear Jenna,

Long time fan. This is my ABSOLUTE favorite video of yours. Caffeine Apocalypse was the best forever but I keep watching this one and dying of laughter.

My everything was lost in November of 2018 in The Camp Fire. Somedays are really hard. This video always encourages me to pursue my dreams and in the meantime utilize fuckery to make things interesting. Thanks for all the laughs. I’ve really needed them lately.

💗
Things I heard Jenna say in this one (1) video:

'No no no fix it I'm a virgo'

'You're saying I can't grow seven inches in a year?  They said flying was impossible and along come the wright brothers dwoooo'

'No no no no you put that sentence back in your mouth'

Please feel free to add some if you wish
When she first walks out in her full outfit, she looks like Phoebe from Friends for a quick second and it was the most glorious thing ever!
Marry someone who supports your bs as much as Julien supports Jenna’s 😂
This will be me during my Mid-Life crisis
Also "HeLl yEaH"
everyone let’s pray to our lord and saviour,Jenna.Lets say our prayers;
"im a skinwalker"
"NO NO NO NO no put that sentence BACK in your MOUTH"
Sometimes I go back to this and suddenly all is right with my life.
lmao jenna singing i wanna be tall while staring at her psychology degree is a mood
Same jenna, i was supposed to be 5'8 but im 5'5 im gonna to bare knuckle box my doctor
trying to go to sleep
almost asleep
My Anxiety, insecurities, and depression all at once: 3:27
6 year old Virgo Sister: What the heck happened to her hair?
Me: Hairspray
She needs to do this again but turn into rabwitch
I am so glad that I’ve been watching Jenna from the start, because if this was the first video I ever saw, I’d be concerned for her. 😂😂 Nope, this is business as usual.
JennaJENNA I NEED MORE PIANO SONGS IN THIS STYLE 
ITLL MAKE YOU TALLER I SWEAR

👀🗿
You can do it jenna marbles...they sell painters stilts at home depot...
Why didn't they bring Jenna to the Met Gala? She could've worn her tall outfit.
That song gave me Bo Burnham vibes for some reason
As a short person who is constantly around tall people, I can say Jenna has the tallest energy I’ve ever witnessed.
This is a met gala look if I ever saw one.
Dang I didn’t know Jenna was a composer!
Jenna Marbles wanna be a lot of things
She wanna be a green screen
She wanna be a toothbrush 
She wanna be a chair
But most importantly....




She wanna be tall
Jenna and Julien are my last two brainsells on an exam😂😂😂😂
The first four minutes of this video are better than any video on this platform
This is another example of jenna really wanting to have her time. 


Thanks for the likes ;)
The tall person look has serious boss fight energy
The new yugioh protagonist looks sick
" in a casual game of pick up basketball " 
MY FAVORITE PART OMFGGGGG
The keyboard segment is already the funniest thing I've seen this year
If the first 2 minutes of this video exactly were put on iTunes I’d 100% buy it
lol they said I would be 5'6" and im barely 5'1" STOP BEING SO PRIVUHLIGEDDD-UHHHH
I was crying and laughing when the hair stayed up
The intro is the best thing ever to be created ever
Jenna emits tall person energy I thought she was at least 5’7
LMAO THAT INTROOOO 😂 😂 😂 also why did 2:04 sound like dogs? 😂
I'm eternally  happy that this blessed video was made
Teacher: what do you want to be 
Billy: i want to go to space 
Jenna marbles: sings song I WANT TO BE TALLLLLLLLLLL
Lol dude I’m only 156 cm. I wanna be taller too.
"You put that sentence back in your mouth"
The background cricket noises are oddly okay.
THIS WAS THE BEST JENNA MARBLES VIDEO THAT WAS EVER MADE
I'm 5'10 and I'm 12. Honestly being tall is not what you would expect.  




BE THANKFUL YOU ARE SHORT!!!!!!!!!!!!🙏🙏🙏🙌
"Put the sentence back in your mouth" hahahaha.
Looking like a fan brush. Looking like a bird of paradise.
Thing I say all the time now: "You put that sentence back in your mouth." Thanks, Jenna!
Jenna: "can I get a hell yeah!?!?"

My brother in the background: "HELL YEAH!!!" 

(THIS LITERALLY HAPPENED 😂)
I'm 5 ft 11 I don't have that much power. Man Jenna maybe I should grow more. 😂
”am i taller or what??”
”you’re taller.. and what”
As a 5 foot tall person I can confidently say this is still the best thing ever
I love this so much! The funniest thing about this to me is her goal is to grow 7 inches which would make her 6 feet tall, which is how tall I am. It's times like this that I realise how unusual it is to be a 6 foot tall woman. Ah well! Maybe my new year's resolution should have been to shrink by 7 inches haha.
What's the matter, you don't like "Fur Elise"

Put that on my tombstone
I also would've watched her try to get all that hair spray out of her hair. (With clothes on obvi)
.....I feel this on a spiritual level, being 4"9' sucks man
As a fellow tall person, this lifestyle is 100% accurate
“Yes I can BEACH 🏖!” I am literally dying right now !!!!!!
I’ll lend Jenna some of my height, I’m 14 and almost 6ft. Unlike Jenna, I don’t wanna be tallll
6:50 - 
“I’m a skinwalker”
“No no no no no no, you put that sentence back in your mouth” 
😂😂😂
You’re just being a hater
You’re being a hater
I can I can do it I can grow seven inches!
Cynthia, she’s a really cool dancer, 
Cynthia boogie to the groove now,
She’s got the moves, watch her move those arms and legs.

This was playing in my head throughout the whole video because all I could think of is Angelica’s torn little doll, Cynthia, from Rugrats.
how much is 5,5. i use meters and i am 1,58m. yelp
5'7/5'8 over here and still growing apparently.
2019 is all about Big Jenna Energy™
When she pushed Julian down ☠️☠️💀💀🤣🤣 and the end
my stomach is in pain. my jaw hurts. i have been laughing for 14 minutes and 20 seconds straight. send help.
Where can I find this on Spotify?? 😂😂
nobody:

Jenna: HellooOOO
this might be the best intro in youtube history -
I just had the most depressing day and now I’m scream-laughing at this so thanks for the pick me up 👍💕
Wtf Was That Damn intro JENNA 😂😂😂
As a 5'9" girl... it's not that exciting. It's a pain in the butt to find clothes that fit right.
“There’s a robot on mars right now” 

.... sike
What a missed opportunity for “I have a basketball game tomorrow”
Looking like a Morphe M310 up in here.
Hi I'm sick and this is the third consecutive time I've watched this video pray for me
four months later im still not over the fast bit in the beginning song
She was actually really good at piano
I Want To Be Tall because i have a basketball game tomorrow
Why did I read the title "I wanna be a wall"?????? I'm so dumbb
ok but why does she look like a character from the hunger games
1:40 I envy Jenna's ability to hype herself up
This was the first time that I felt genuinely concerned for Jenna’s mental health
“I want to be tall” now on iTunes
She's Finally Lost Her Damn Mind ((jk-joking))
There were probably some drugs involved at the beginning of this video
i'm absolutely gonna dunk on you at least three times
I think she wants to be tall




Can't tell tho
lyrics:
i wanna be tall
i wanna be a tall person
i wanna be tall
i wanna tower over other people
i wanna be tall
(what are you doing?)
i wanna be tall (x2)
(you wanna be tall?)
i wanna be taller than i am
(ok, stop doing that. turn that off. t-  stop.)
i’m gonna be tall
(stop talking to me with-)

This video...my favourite of hers so far. I was in stitches 😂😂
I would love to see the Debbie Machine react to some of Jenna's videos.
Someone get this woman a record deal 
The first album name will be  CAN I GET A HELL YEAH!!!
Jenna daniel ruffing and Victoria shell did another video!!! Its a ratchet salon song!!
Plays angelic chord
CAN I GET A "HELL YEAH"?!
OMG WHEN I SAW JOANNA ON
HER PHONE I SCREAMED I LOVE THAT QUEEN
I couldn’t stop laughing in the beginning 😂😂😂 Jenna, you kind of had some bars! 🎶🎵 OOOOHHMMM!!
I think about this video a lot
The song at the beginning is my ringtone lmaooo
“Am I taller or what?”
“...you’re taller... AND what.”
i would go to church if we worshiped jenna and her dogs
Me:" Bro, look I could do this to be tall!!!"
Bro: "She literally looks like a paint brush"
My stomach hurts from laughing so much this was so funny omgggggg
im the 3rd tallest kid in my class and it SUCKS 

but being real short doesn’t seem that nice either

ur perfect size perfect 👌🏻
Jenna: Am I taller or what?
Julien: You're taller AND what
😂😂
Beach turned into the Statue of Liberty
My doctor told me when I was 14 and 5'4" that I was done growing. I showed him! I'm now 5'5" and 1/4 of an inch. The shortest person in my immediate family but STILL
I have watched this 10x today xD
Welcome to 2019, if you’re gonna arrive... arrive with a vibe
Omfg im in love with the intro 😂
I’ve replayed the first two minutes so many times 😂😂 Hell yeah🙌🏼
why is this look so camp met gala 2019
she looks like she would be a character in lazy town🤣😭
The most prepared Jenna has ever been for her basketball game tomorrow.
is 10 and 5’1





It’s not fun being tall >:(
i can confirm that this is how being a tall person feels like
I wish I could watch this video, but they keep telling me to click away...
i am 6'4 and find this hilarious
Those extra 7 inches are gonna be DOPE for your basketball game tomorrow!
i always thought i was tall..





i’m also 5”5
It never occurs to me that I might be taller than celebrities
When I first saw this I thought it was Naruto cosplay
The song at the beginning is me every time I put on heels
I’m 16 (female) and I’m nearly 6ft 

I WANT TO BE SHORT

CAN I GET A HELL YEAAAAAAHH
Why is she low-key good at playing piano 😂😂
That intro is the GREATEST thing I have ever watched 😂😂❤️❤️
i legit have tears in my eyes it's 12:05 and my entire family is asleep
I love the fact that while she is singing "I wanna be taaaaaaall", she is literally sitting in front of her University degree!
this video is so legendary, even the first 20 seconds are pure gold...I always wanna listen to that first 20 3 times before finishing the video
The punk rockers are shaking in their studded boots
In this video Jenna reminds me of lele pons, but actually funny.

And cute.
I want this intro as my ringtone
Jenna: CAN I GET A HELL YEA

Me home alone: hElL yEA
The way she walks has Dark Souls Enemy Energy
Girl lookin like Sideshow Bob
9:03 top 10 anime villains
I almost have this whole video memorized. Her face is so cute just let her be tall Julien!!! Hehe
Tall Jenna is what I see when I experience sleep paralysis
Someone: says something remotely negative

Me: 12:24
i'M Literally Crying From Laughing
The first 2 minutes of this video made me laugh harder than i have for months
I'm ready for next years part 2: 
I Want Be Taller; The Sequel
Scary edits coming in 3... 2... 1...
It would be amazing if she put on the same outfit and actually played basketball
The first minute and 10 seconds of this video is just Jenna acting like Cermit
It’s been years since I lolled with tears. And never at a YouTube vid. I’m effin’ finished 🤣 I’m a seasoned broadcaster and heavily seasoned clown. So thank you from the bottom of my 42 year old cynical heart.
She is the mum I wANt


Hell yeahhhh
this is what i imagined adulthood was like when i was 9 and i can't believe i was right
I’m proud that this was made in my birthday
9:05 
Please let this be a normal field trip
there is a ten year old in my class who is 5'7
jenna watches joannas videos..........WE STAN LEGENDS SUPPORTING LEGENDS
the song at the beginning kinda went hard though
1:38 - 1:57 me

3:24 - 3:28 my friend 😆
~Jenna~ can I get a hell yeah

~me~ HELL YEAH

~my mom~ THIS IS A CHRISTIAN MINECRAFT  SEVRER
She Did eeeT! \m/ #RockOn
this is my favorite video on youtube to ever exist in literally dying from laughter right now 😂😂😂😂
Remember when Jenna used to tell us what a person was like by their underwear? This channel has been so much fun to grow with. This was a weird video, but I love them so much!
I keep coming back to this video. Just brilliant in so many ways
This is my favorite intro EVER on any YouTube channel in existence!!!
is this how your cermet an grow?
This is high fashion ya'll
HIGH (weedass) FASHION
So many horror edits will be made. Can't wait.
Jenna became an anime cosplayer for a day
I had to pause after that feral cry of "OH SHIT!" That woke something up in my short soul.
i,m going to the basketball game tomorrrow
im like 5'6.9 (basically 5'7) and only 13. Let me tell you it's NOT that fun, i hate it 
all my friends are short or average height for a 13 yr old and i feel so awkward around them.
i only have 2 friends that are a tiny bit taller than me so i purposely try to stand around them 😂
everyone needs a julien in their life. A person who supports your toothbrush, chair, body massager, 7 inch taller, aspiring pick up basketballer, and salon owner phases.
is Jaenna going to groaw
was she drunk😂😂😂❤️
What if I told you-

 I am 14 1/2 years old

 and






 am currently 






5'11 <.<
i think jenna should get stilts and go even taller
The first minute and 55 seconds is a big thats what he said
this whole video shows jenna’s aries side
ive been 5'1 since 4th grade ;-; im currently a freshman
Jenna needs to get stilts and reach her final form
Wish my boyfriend could give me seven inches. 😔😔😔
The intro really got me😂 HELL YEAHHHHH AHHHHHH SHIT
MET GALA OUTSIDE 2019
I feel like this is one of those rare occasions where Jenna's the 5 yr old and not julien😂😂
The amount of times I tend to watch this in a single sitting is extremely disappointing.
When Jenna is tall = she wants to fight everything 

When Julien is a Bratz = he wants to fight everything
I got 10 inch platform stripper heels today because this video inspired me
Jenna :can I get a hell yea
Me at three in the morning cause I couldn't sleep: HEEEEELLLL YEEEAAA !!!!!

You should cosplay squidward when he was extra handsome lol
I was so scared to watch this video because the crazy voice and light thing in the begin that i had to watch some out of contexts of this video first lol

Thank you for making my day. I am only 5ft and everyone around me always picks on my height. Best wishes on being tall! Much love, a fellow short person <3

You Should Have Gotten Those 8Ft Platform Crocs
It's two o'clock in the morning and I just woke my husband up laughing at this omg 😂
You've outdone yourself. THIS IS THE INTERNET I SIGNED UP FOR.
When she says tall is powerful all I can think is

She looks like Ezma from Kuzco's new groove @ 12:40 lol
I have been subscribed for almost 10 years and I never ever have gotten tired of this channel. Jenna, thank you for endless laughter and smiles. You’re an amazing hoomam, and I wish nothing but the best for you and Julien in 2019!!!!
When you want to be tall but instead end up cosplaying as Angelica's doll Cynthia off the Rugrats.
You know what goes nice with being tall? A squeak toy intro
she is julien's sugar mama, like damn look at their mansion
WHY DO I LOVE THE INTRO
"No no no you put that sentence back in your mouth" - this is my new favorite phrase
when julian was brushing through her hair it reminded me up those hair stylists games when u blow dry it😂😂
this is the best version of jenna
She straight up looks like Angelica’s doll from Rugrats. 😭😭
sits in front of her psychology degree and sings I Want To Be Tall - Jenna Marbles 2018... wait, 2019 it is
1:00 Julian explaining to Jenna how biology works.... for once 😂
You go girl
Literally pissed myself laughing
Yeah try being 5ft tall though 

I’m also a very dysphoric trans guy so I swear I was cursed

I wish I was like at least 5’6
This is your Aquarius moon. I cant. Lol
These types of videos usually end with Jenna obtaining some sort of strange energy and Julian not signing up for it.
Edit: wow the likes, my friend just called me iconic, this is my biggest achievement of my life.
So thats what happened to my sim
Noone:
Jenna: iM a vIRgO
This is literally my favourite video in the history of YouTube and I’ve been watching YouTube for at least 6 years!
I am VERY exited for the horror edits!
jesus christ why was the piano intro and song actually really good like i was boppin
Did anybody think of something else they were doing in thumbnail?
"You put that sentence back in your mouth!!"
The outfit makes her look like Goku from Dragon Ball Z hahahaha
YOU LOOK LIKE CYNTHIA FROM RUGRATS hahahahah
She went from toothbrush to paintbrush
Best intro I've ever seen.
Hands down, her best video.
when you look in jenna’s closet there’s just a bunch of stripper shoes
I actually thought she got possessed in the first part
Lyrics:
I wanna be tAaAaaAaAaLLlLL
I wAnna TOWER OVER PEOPLEEEEEEEEE
heavenly piano plays loudly in the background
JENNA! ever since you posted this my 3 year old has been obsessed with being tall lol, I thought her obsession would die down  BUT IT HASNT 😂
Jenna: can I get a HELL YEA
Me at 3 am in my room while everybody is asleep: HELL YEA
calling all Jenna horror editors!!!!! this is your moment to shine!!!
The start of this eerily reminded me of the end of Hereditary.
She’s gotta be tall for her basketball game tomorrow.
Какой балдёж
У неё оказывается офигенный голос
Jaheim looks like a makeup highlight brush
She looks like a Cynthia doll from rugrats 😂😂😂
i'LL aDd mUy 7 InChUs PiNus YAAAAAAA
She just keeps giving more content for horror movie trailers
Can we please have this song as a download? I will pay
CAN I GET A HELLLLL YEHHHHH
At 5ft 3inch I would love to be taller  might try this one day lol 😂
This is my theme tune (I am so tall)
jenna bringing that tall ass porcupine energy into 2019
That intro is my mantra of the year
This is one of my fav videos I always. Come back to it
0:39 😂😂😂
When someone tells you to just stop, but you just add another key.
My 5’ 3” self is jealous of that positive energy you radiating beech
This is the 2019 selfish Jenna I signed up for
Didn't Go to Her Head at-aLL xD
She reminds me of Cynthia from rugrats 😂
That intro is the most inspirational song of 2019
You’re finally ready for your basketball game tomorrow
This is exactly the content I need when I'm downing a bottle of cherry wine all by myself on a Sunday night. Sincerely, an equally as tall(short) person as you. I wanna b tall too bish
This is so random and I love it 😂 ❤️
This beginning was so funny I actually cried.
Jenna looks like a crazy homeless person !! Lmao (it's a joke )
this is the youtube I want in 2019.
I keep coming back to this video every time I'm sad. This is why I love the internet.
Where is your Netflix special?!
Seems like somethng Phebe fro friends would do
That intro needs to be an actual song 😂
How is she CONSISTENTLY hilarious each week? Doing literally the simplest of tasks... it’s amazing. She really speaks to the inner weirdo inside of me. I love her. She’ll be around for a loooong time.
This is my favourite video on youtube
I'm honestly offended that she's not subscribed to Joanna ceddia like come on
who would dislike this masterpiece
HELL YEAH 😂!!!!!!
Can't wait for the horror edits <3
Jenna Marbles before: 🎶I Wanna Be Taaaaall.🎶

Jenna Marbles after: 🎶I’m Gonna Dunk On Yooouuu.🎶
shit dude I was so like emo today and then i started rewatching this and the music is amazing holy crap its so good it made me laugh
My god jenna BE MY BEST FRIEND
Every week I have literally no expectations for Jenna’s video will be, and every single week I am still surprised
As a tall person (I’m 6’1) I do have to bend over to use taps 😂
Why does the intro sound so damn good!  Ahaha
I want to do this kind of stuff when I'm about 30.
i think you would really like the song ten feet tall by cavetown
Jenna I think you actually just became an Aries for 2019.
This is the best video on the internet.
You ever be 5’9 just to flex on Jenna 💪🏼🤑
Can I get a HEEEEEELLLL YEAAAHHH
I heard her hair crack
I love how her keyboard is in the corner facing a wall with her masters degree right above for inspiration lol
HELLLLLL YEAAAA
OMG! The intro XD
there’s tears streaming down my face JENNA WHYYYY 😂
I look like Paula d 😂😂 you should have gone out in public like that lmao you remind me of rugrats Angelica’s Barbie 😂
I wonder if we’re intentionally leaning into the horror edits or if Jenna has finally accepted her true nature
That orange shirt made me think of Magda from There's Something About Mary
Can we just appreciate for a moment that even though she is sore she still managed to wear those shoes!
I'm 5'11 and 3/4 of the inch to 6'0 and yes, I know I'm taller than most BUT I SWEAR TO GOD I WANT TO JUST BE AN INCH OR THREE TALLER
"My sons are going to dunk on your sons, and then they will pick me up so I can dunk on you" - Joe Pera
The beginning was so majestic and inspirational
A few years ago I took a daily injection that made me taller.
at least you aren't naturally 5 foot XD
I honestly thought Jenna went crazy for a sec
I can’t believe I am the first person to comment this but when Julian was like 'I know!' I thought he was gonna kiss her 😳😅
Can't wait for the horror edits
Why couldn't she play megalovania a the very end?
Dear Jenna, If you want to be tall, Move to Asia. Everyone will be short and you will be the tallest human being here :)
As a fellow tall person, I appreciate this very much
Could you guys do a serious video where you tell us how to have a successful relationship!!!? You guys seem to have it figured out
ICONIC intro...... goes to buy keyboard 🤣
4:04 is my favorite part XD
I wanna be tall. My lil sis is taller than meh. ;-; halp
Legit while she was laying down her hair looked like a fancy highlighter brush
OH HELL YEAH I'm 5' 5" too!
“You put that sentence back in your mouth”😂😂😂
That house the house you get all that weird stuff going on a weird sound very scary
This has so many Jimin vibes
Why is this song really good tho.


Why are all Jenna’s songs actually so good.
Jenna's walk in her outfit reveal totally reminded me of Austin powers gold member. When Austin is on mini mes shoulders  in the submarine 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
In 2018 she was a toothbrush...
In 2019 she’s a fan-brush

👏 What 👏 a 👏 glow 👏 up 👏
Love the cameo of the degrees, it goes with the tall people energy lol
I think Jenna has become possessed.....😭 PS you better never go to church they may heal you of all your problems...
It’s May and I had a long day, wanted to laugh and this video is just gold. I can watch the first 2 and half minutes on repeat and never get tired of it.
LMFAOOOO “I look like Pauly D”
Now she can have a basketball game tomorrow.
Not only did she become taller but she also became a lower budget version of Yzma
you watch Joana too. Sorry I got way too excited about that for a sec.
I keep rewatching this video because
Okay but her hairstyle before messing with it is super pretty
THIS is the content I subscribed for. Thank you for this gracious blessing
I have had the worst day. My kids haven’t slept in 3 days. I found out my daughter’s epilepsy is getting worse. I haven’t seen my husband in over a week because of how much he’s been working. But this had me cracking up laughing. And I so, so, so appreciate it.

some friendly advice. best hairspray to use for this look is Got2B. it gives no shits about the oils in your hair like a lot of hairsprays use. my fellow cosplayers will agree.
@9:98 her name is Jenna, she's a 32 year old lady, she towers over others while crying on the phone and she actually has a basketball game tommorow
“im 32 and i wanna grow seven inches this year its my nEw YeArS rEsOlOuTiOn”
Her tall person outfit looks like Phoebe’s outfit when she found out about Chandler and Monica lmao
What’s the matter you don’t like FUR ELISE?!

There's 20 something inch heals on amazone for sale I really want to see you in and be a tall person

Why do I relate so much? 😖😆
I'm Dead 😂😂😂😂
One of my favorites 👀
Can I get a HELL YEAH from the congregation
Lookin like a DIY Love Shocker , I love it
How did no one notice she looks like Cynthia from Rugrats
I'm 6'2" and you're not.
1:00 in the morning and I'm weezing 😂
I never realized she was 5'5", she radiates tall energy
This has the same energy of that video of that tall lady where she bends over backwards to go through doorways
Did you grow yet? Me neither. Dang
Why wouldn't you change before the hair? I can't imagine trying to get a shirt on and off over that hair lmao
Hell yeah you can be hella tall
I can SMELL all the horror edits coming. That ending outfit was a THING.
the amount of times i have watched this video is embarrassing
Ok but why is this tall song so good? It’s stuck in my head

SHE IS BACC
"I look like Pauly D!" Lmao

Barber: So what do you want
Jenna: Yall ever seen a peacock before
Barber: Say no more
HELLLLL YEA!
“So you wanna... spike up your hair and wear tall shoes?

Yeah... so I can be

 “
Can you please make a video about the YouTube channels you watch on your spare time?! And your favorite movies? Because you seem knowledgeable about them or maybe it’s because Julian knows nothing about them hahah 😂😂
lemme get a hell yeahh!!!!!!{
As soon as Julian started brushing it out in a fan shape, I was like: this is some Rugrats Cynthia Doll  v i b e s.
Oh my god! Pleeeeease make another Hilary Clinton video.
I was ok until u whispered “thank u” into the keyboard and then I laughed so hard I couldn’t breathe
I thoroughly enjoyed that beginning
Someone showed me this, cause I'm like 4'9'', and I style my hair straight up and often wear 5.5'' boots xD With hair and boots I think I'm almost 6'! I'm CarolineCarnivorous on instagram if you wanna see
you don't know how it feels
I expect a video at the end of the year entitled, "I Am Tall."
petition to have every one of jenna’s intros like this one
okay but those pants look so good on her
You look like ezma from emperors new groove
17 and 4'10 :') I'm fineeee
I’m just waiting for ‘I wanna be tall’ to come out on iTunes 😐
I couldnt stop laughing when Jenna was like "CAN I GET A HELL YEAHHH" with her psychology degree right in front of her 😂😂

Edit: holy crap how did this get 3k likes ?!?! Thank you
dogs in the back round: WTF!?!
What about  me i'm 162 cm ,and i'm still taller than most of my friends,  rarely have friends that 170 cm tall,  esp girls
she looked like naruto 😂
What is this intense Jojo aura!!!
Jenna's extra tall extra aggressive energy is what I needed on this Thursday morning.
this fridge is much too small for me
5:50  when I drop my fan brush on the ground
I went through the first 4 minutes of this video thinking the title was “I Want To Be A Ball”
i may be tall, but i have words
She just got her newly healthy hair messed up again. That's the Jenna I subscribed to. Quality content.
This is an alien telling you you're  "welcome to chili's"
Girls are lucky. Most people are fine with short girls, but I'm like 5 foot 3 or 4, and I haven't grown in over a year :(
Her hair straight up look like a fish tail 🤣
She reminds me of Goku @ 13:25 😂
*Music play•
Julian walks in
Julian “What are you doing?”
Jenna “I WANNA BE TALLLL” 


Thanks for the 492 likes  🤪
me entering 2019 like 10:26
Should have played I wish at some point of this video 😂
I just love this video. It makes me laugh so much.
Tall Jenna is literally me when I'm feeling a certain type of way.
I’m really powerful 🤣
No joke, I want a 'I wanna be tall' studio version so bad

Has everyone reached a universal decision that this is the best intro to any video ever because I hope so
Yzma looks good here
She grows seven inches and immediately becomes a domestic abuser lol
14:00 is my sleep paralysis
Dress up like a paint brush and use your hair to follow a bob ross painting tutorial...
i died laughing but it was so worth it! i love jenna
I'm a 16 year old girl Who's 6ft tall and still slowly growing
I am living for that intro
This is the most worthwhile thing I’ve seen on YouTube all year
i love how julien supports anything jenna does. it's so cute
I JUST WANT TO BE FIVE FEET TALL DONT TELL ME YOU WANT TO BE TALLER UNTIL YOU FEEL MY PAIN
I have the song stuck in my head
.. i actually dont like being tall sometimes
Did you mean a sideways mohawk
i cant wait for all the creepy trailers coming up for this lmao
I think i might do one for my channel😂
I wish I could grow too haha.
*i can smell all that hair spray from here*
That intro was the best thing I've ever seen.
How can someone not love her
"You either feel me or you don't. And if you don't, then get out."  That's the energy I want to bring into 2019.
I listen to the first 2 mins and 20 secs over and over again because I love it so much.
Who you fighting
The absolute raw energy in the first two minutes makes my socks shake right off
This is me .... Im 5'1 and 21
That opening was honestly one of the funniest and most original openings I've seen in a YouTube video. Top 10 Anime OPs of All Time?
Lmao Your As Old As My Mom And Dad...…………...
7:45 is the best part by far change my mind
Where can I sign up for the church of Jenna Marbles
Every time i watch this i cry laughing
petition to get “I Wanna be Tall” by Jenna Marbles on iTunes
She looks like an anime character that can kill everyone in a 50 ft. radius.
Honestly her song at the start was going really well 😂 0:54 - 1:28
I would DIE if you would colab with missgaymatte and have her do your makeup! In the beginning of the video it looked like you had bratz doll eyes, looked so cute!
what is the 'thank youuu" thing she keeps doing i need a source jenna
As a tall person, can confirm this is what being tall is like
Girl being 5’5 is not that short I am 5’5 and I am literally taller than most of the women I see out in public. Simple heels will give you just enough height. Lol 😂
this will forever be the most iconic intro ever
I need a whole video of Jenna just playing random songs and stuff on the piano
I actually could not stop laughing this whole video
I swear Jenna is the only person that gives us QUALITY CONTENT😂
She looks like a paint brush and a Dr. Suess Character.
Im 18 and 5'3.... 
my 12yr old cousin towers over me.... and my little brother.
I cry a lot
This is my favorite video ever rn I love the song
where can i find that billboard top 100 song "i wanna be tall"? spotify?

Wish I was a baller wish I was a little bit taller
Cynthia. rugrats. irl
The real video starts at 4:00-5:00

#Dead xD
My mum thought I'd be 5'6" cos I was half that at age 2, but I'm 5'5", though I was half an inch less until my back got overcurved and then got almost straightened again (not 100% sure how I gained a new half-inch).
I just come here again and again for the intro now
I will hand over 7 in. mom
im too tall
Coming into 2019 looking like a paintbrush
I can relate to this title on extreme levels
We need an update on how tall are you now
Could you please tell which model keyboard you have?
And its sad to say im the tallest in my class
Her hair was too healthy, she knew it was time to ruin it again
Should've been to the met gala
She looks like I can do my highlighter with her. She looks like a fan brush 😂
BEST. INTRO. EVER.
I want to be short.
My favorite detail of this video is the college degree in the shot of Jenna singing about being tall while her hair is  like that
Peacock mode activated
lol I don’t know if anyone’s said this but she looks/walks like The reapers from Monkeybone😂😂😂
I’m so glad everyone is counting Joana as a official YouTuber
9:03 now THIS is camp fashion
“I’m very busy,” she says, her hair flapping as she creepily hobbles away
you either feel me or u dont and if u dont then get out 😂😂😂
im actually in tears laughing omfg
Umm I yelled hell yeah at 2am 😅😈
You one snantameter taller than cermit
best intro for a comeback after the holidays
and then there's me who is supposed to be 4 inches shorter than Jenna
1:46 when the teacher asks you if you have your ho e work
Get chu a man who will brush your hair and then make it stay in place
lamarck was right
Can we get a “I wanna be tall” music video??????
Don king, Or Cynthia
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while.😂
Her hair and head reminds me of a peacock 🦚
i feel this so much
Can I get a hellyeah? CAN I GET A HEEEEEEELLYEAAH!?!?
When you are 5 foot and growing 7 inches would only put you slightly above average female height. 🙂🙃 This is fine.
Love  the dog videos with Kermit and marbles and peach
After watching the movie “Us” I can confirm the being at 9:06 is Jenna’s tethered imitating her
I want to be taller 💃🏻😂
she should’ve worn her beard
I watch this video a lot
johnny bravo hair tutorial
Can I geta hell yeah
This video is my new go to when I need to laugh or smile.
wow she actually has basketball game tomorrow
why does this remind me of emilia fart?
6:11 Jenna’s hair looks EXACTLY like a damp fan brush or a highlighter makeup brush
CAN I GET A HELL YEAH
CAN I GET A HELL YEAH
She reminds me of Yzma from emperors new groove when she’s tall
Literally the literal content i signed up for, I feel like Jenna's living out my weird thoughts I love this so muchhhhh
3:01 not anymore 😔
Jenna: CAN I GET A HeeEEEeeLLlL yyYYEEeeAAaaAhh

Me: HEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLL YEEAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH BIIITTCCCCHHHHHHHH
12:38 idk why but that got me dead 😂😂😂
I am 100% convinced that Jenna is THE most naturally funniest person alive.
she looks like an ace attorney witness in that outfit
The selfish content you made in 2018 was the most relatable, funny, wholesome, and therapeutic stuff you've put on this channel. Here's hoping for another selfish year 😘
Stranger: what type of dog is Kermit?

Jenna: NASTY
Marbles is the nicest, most caring, sensitive, smart dog u have yet he is de smallest and least appreciated one. One like equals one kiss for marbles
Jenna: "Kermit, you screaming isn't part of the royalty free music"
Kermit: 👁👄👁
              💧     💧
peach: is brave and jumps in a huge pool 
also peach: is scared of a bath
My heart exploded when Jenna lifted mr marbles. He looks so happy! Yay for a successful tooth removal
peach: completely.fine with an entire pool

also peach: terrified of 5 inches of bathwater
Ah yes,
Weech,
Mubble,
And SquareMeat
In the Spa
🍑: WTF MOMMY

🐸: humanjana me no wet

🔮: huh so this is what drowning feels like
The other dogs: 👁‍🗨🐽👁‍🗨
Marbles: 👁👅👁
Please continue being selfish with your content for the rest of your youtube career, thank you Jenna, love you girl
Peach: no mommy scared to get bath no more
Kermit: mother what is this peasantry
Marbles: no idea what is happening but mommy is here so I’m okay
Straight up I would happily watch a 20 minute video of marbles getting baths to royalty free $25 spa music. Multiple times even. So cute and relaxing at the same damn time.
The fact that Jenna didn’t roll up her sleeves a little bit more is giving me anxiety
Almost fell asleep,not because it was boring but because of the totally worth 25$ music. Great vid
Marbles is precious
His innocence needs to be protected
*wow I love getting any amount of likes on my comment
Jenna:  welcome to the spa  


Kermit: AM VERY NERVOUS
IDK why but this made me so emotional i almost cried. It's such a beautifully captured moment with Jenna bathing Peach, almost like Peach is the real freaking human child
Jenna being so sweet to her dogs is the most purest thing I have ever witnessed
Why is no one talking about peach humping Kermit??😭 (0:27)

Edit: wow I thought know one would like this comment 😂
You can literally see how much better Marble feels now without his mean teeth.
Julien: sees peach humping Kermit huh, wait what?
The tiny sound at 7:54 😍
Me: *looks at dogs humping* WTF
Me: Looks at Jenna's sweater** WTF
My all time favorite videos on this channel are the videos where marbles is so genuinely happy and relaxed
It’s getting to the point where Peach is the only one that still looks like a dog. Marbles looks like a beanie baby and Kermit, I say this from a place of love, is looking more and more like Scrat from ice age every video.
I've had a really stressful day at work, I have a panic disorder (comorbid with social anxiety and ptsd)  and I've been really struggling today with panic attacks and anxiety. I really needed this right now. You're my favorite, Jenna. You're a constant comfort in my life and have been since I was a preteen, watching your old webcam videos and rants. I always come to your channel after a hard day. Thank you for being a light and a calming presence. Love you lots.
have fun washing Bunny 😅 I have to lift my 50 lb + big dogs into the tub
I have a 14-yr-old chihuahua & every time I watch Marbles in the videos it makes me soooo sad bc my baby is a lot more out of it than him. She’s blind out of her left eye, deaf out of her left ear & half deaf out of her right. It just reminds me that she’s basically living extra hours at this point. She can be gone whenever her little body decides she’s done being a little earth angel!! 😭😭😭
Marble completely melted my heart even more than before in this video and i didnt think that could happen 💘💘💘💘💘💘
Now that Marbles is toothless and pain-free, he looks so much more alive and happy :) He was totally smiling in the bath and chillaxing (unlike the NaStY)
7:49 I like how marbles is so stoned beyond belief he just lays in the bathtub
“You work so hard...” 
at being a NASTY boy
peachie looks more emotionally hurt and betrayed than physically scared
THIS IS THE CONTENT I SIGNED UP FOR!!!!

I know the video is older but I love when it still pops up on my recommended.
Queen of quality content
Mr. Marbles - appreciative




Miss Weach - clingy 




Nasty boy - nasty
Why did this relax me????😂❤️
The head tilt at 8:07 WAS SO FREAKING CUTE I SOBBED
Now I see why people ask if marble is dead 😭😭😭
The most heartfelt moments are whenever you and Mr. Marbles are interacting. You two have been through a lot together and the love and the bond that you two share is incredibly precious.
This is the most wholesome video I've seen in the longest time
This was so relaxing to watch and I'm absolutely in love with how in love you are with all your pups! Thank you for being Awesome ❤❤❤
You also left your squeak toy intro in 2018 too :(
The whole time 

Cement was just like: 👁👄👁    YOU JUST MADE ME A NONE NASTY BOI!? 😢
Your recent "selfish" content has just been so good. So wholesome. Happy clean doggos. 
Bless you and your doggos.
Your dogs look like they went on an emotional trip omg 😂
Jenna- does this feel nice marbles
Marbles can’t stand the  fact that he is too little to get out
8:22
i was drinking hot choco when you said that, and i choked.
The relationship you have with Marble seems very special. Cherish those moments man. Cherish 'em. ❤️
marbles was literally smiling when she picked him up
peach needing constant hugs from her mom is very relatable
Can we get this kinda video again with Mrs Rabbit?
LMAO PEACH WAS HUMPING KERMIT IM DEAD

edit: I JUST NOTICED JENNAS SWEATER-
Peach:  I need a hug.
Me: Awwwwwwwwwwww!!!
Peach: *Hugs Jenna*
Me: I love it.
Marbles' tongue coming out of his mouth made me cry
Okay but Mubble looked so relaxed that I cried?
Omg Peach was so cute during her bath!! I almost melted!!😍😍
6:21 My mom waking me up to school >:'''(
Is it just me or is it the cutest thing ever when iggys blink or when a mr marbles looks at their mom🥺
Have y'all given Bunny a bath yet?
Ahhh yes Apple, Toad, and Granite. My favorite 3 dogs. Love you jenna!
Omg marbles is so fking cuuuute.. I don't understand people who make fun of him lol, it's so precious when he looks up at you
“Is it $25 worth of nice?”
Me anytime I take a bath using lush products.
Kermits the lemon gram dude from adventure time who just constantly screams
I love her sweater,  jacket,  shirt,  whatever it is. It has reindeer making love
No one:

Marbles: RELAXATION 100
Nasty boi vs clean machine should have been the title
This isn't selfish content because I love it so much please don't stop
Peach has a cute face, and Kermit is... well, it’s something.. 

Marbles has a beautiful smile too. (Jk I love Kermit)
I love marbles so much. Just. Hhh. HES SO SWEET I LOVE HIMMMM
"My dogs smell like butt"
Lol
Marbles is dead from the neck up. So he’s in heaven right now. With all the nice heaven music 🎶 lol 😂
The water sounds were ASMR to my ears, then Kermit just crying in the background
IDK if it was the music or the bathing or your voice. But this is so relaxing
this is quality content 👌
you have some nice action figures
"Kermit, you screaming is not part of the royalty spa music"
All her dogs look terrified I loved how Kermit when she came to pick him up like ran away
why am i tearing up, peach looks so cute & sad awhh bb
This Video is so relaxing 
I habe sleeping Problems and actually get only about 3 hours of sleep a night but this Video calms me down and now i can sleep better then ever💕
The part with marble was so sweet until you hear kermit crying in the back lol
Jenna has the most easygoing audience 😂 we truly love any content given
this could be a drinking game:  a shot for every time she said 'nasty' 😂😂😂
Wolf: the humans will care for us if we act like we like them! 

cut to now 

 

Marble: WHY
Is anyone gonna talk about Jenna's jacket? THE REINDEERS



Edit: yes i know im late
The way they look at her tho 💚💖💔🖤💓💝💘💝💞💚💚💜💜💚🖤💕🖤💔💞💕💞💓💖💕💗💓💝💕💘
Kermit is crying because you didn't wash him with Irish Spring 🙃
0:31
IM CRYING OF LAUGHTER AND CONFUSION😂😭
Marbles is genuinely the cutest thing in existence.
I laugh so hard when I watch her vids 




Nasty boi







Especially cermet
Kermit: runs away from problems
“You screaming is not part of the royalty-free spa music” is ICONIC
0:43 u can tell when she described marble,she said boi not boy
Yall taking notice of Kermit.... BUT CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND LOOK AT THE REINDEER PATTERN ON JENNAS ONSIE 😂 💀
During the massage portion did anyone else get some intense ~*~*~BoDy MaSsAgE~*~*~ flashbacks?
Marbles has never looked so alive....
Jenna Marbles is so trustworthy. This video is exactly what it says it is. Bless.
A great ending to a crappy year
The only thing that kept me sane this whole year is Jenna’s videos
Is carmat going to grow?
Is cement going to grow?
Is curmot going to grow?
Is cormeat going to grow?
Is comet going to grow?
This was crazy relaxing
this is the content i subscribed for


:)
jenna with marble: soft and sweet, 'hi honey'
jenna with kermit: 'NASTY' BOI', 'really glad i'm wearing a rubber glove', 'hugging sandpaper'
Marbles' brain expired 3 years ago
You got me at “Royalty Free”😆
This inspired me to give my dog a spa day. So thanks Jenna from me and my pupper❤️
Marbles looks like he's trying to be confused but doesn't know how
364 dislikes are from the dirt particles from Kermit’s body
The way marbles looks at Jenna at 7:31 makes me cry
I looooove giving my dogs massage therapy. I treat them better than I treat my human family.
Your dogs are basically cats...
Kind of adorable living meme cats <3 gotta them em tho :3
"Are u hiding from all your problems?!


(-_-)
I'm so glad this has become a dog channel that sometimes features jenna and julien. it's all the good things in the world
Ms.Weach
Cement
Square no teeth
I swear the dead one just blinked!!! JK love you marbles
Peach humping kermit killed me
Omg you have more subs than Jake pual
I think Marbles' depression might be cured.
This was very relaxing up until the blow-dryer startled me
Honestly most peaceful video I’ve watched so far. Almost felt like I was getting a bath 🛀😂😂
    
    Like if you agree 👍🏼
Why am I JUST seeing this?? Honestly one of the most wholesome videos ever 😍❤️
Omg I can’t handle how cute Marble was getting his bath/spa day 💕you’re a great dog mama Jenna!
jenna: "don't disturb him he's sleeping"
cermet: disturbs him
In like 15 minutes of watching your videos for the first time last night this became my favorite channel. This is pure gold🏆
i'm at the dmv trying not to scream laugh at peach dominating kermit
OMG is nobody noticing her sweater though LOL
Marbles will outlive everyone
I FELT TINGLES from Jenna whispering
I LOVE your sweater/hoodie hehehe
Teacher: what do you want to be when you get older?
Me: Jenna freakin marbles
Wow not about you 


Peach you just got ROASTED!!!!!!
How was this a selfish choice? You've basically just given us all an ASMR spa day. 😌😌
@8:31 when your mom forgets that you are alive
i wish i could get an appointment at jenna’s nasty spa
Kortanna: literally nothing
Jenna: ÑÂSSTY!
Зашла после КамедиСтор послушать настоящий голос Джены... Мой мир никогда не будет прежним ... Noooooooooo...
After all the drama on YouTube this year, this is exactly how we should end the year. Peace and love and cuteness. This is the content we need to start Christmas. Happy Holidays pups, Jenna and Julien! I'm glad you're taking time off to be with family and friends and just relax, you've so earned it.
why is nobody talking about her sweatshirt
Fig - traumatized
Cement - IS DIRT
The dead one - whats happening to me
Just watching this now😭
At 5:40 laughed so loud because of that beautiful “mood” shot that I woke up my sister.
Jenna this really has been your year. It sounds cheesy but videos like this have really helped me de-stress and realize that everything is gonna be okay. Your videos hit different :)
marble is a cat.
This was so relaxing , you should do a “I tried Asmr ” video or mukbang 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Kermit's ear slaps get me everytime😂
Kermit: *cries for no reason*
Me: why is that me
It was really fun seeing you “grow up” in front of our eyes. I personally love your content and wish you peace and love during your break and the new year.
Kermit has taken over the mantle of 👁👄👁 from marble
0:29
Peach: casually humping brother
Peach is me getting a shot 

Just hiding with my mom
Your dogs are the sweetest😍💙😊
Jenna, your "selfish" content has made my year so much better. Things have been really tough, but I would always have your and Julien's videos along with the podcasts have given me some things to look forward to during the week. I love watching you just be yourself and do things that you love, and it makes me happy to know that doing that is a possibility. I love you guys, thank you for everything you've done, and I hope you enjoy your well deserved break!
0:30 I could not stop laughing, so I played it like 100+ time's over and over again 😂
he protecc

he attacc 


but most importantly

he want his nazty bacc
👀
👃
👅
Why I think that kermit is just too cute and beautiful for thi world?😍
marble is adorable with his little floppy tongue
7:56 IT LOOKS LIKE SHE PICKED UP A ACTION FIGURE
4:11 nice deer u have there
OH SHIT THE HAIR DRYER! I WAS SO CALM UNTILL THAT LOUD SOUND 🤣 omg
after watching this, i genuinely have my chihuahua a spa day with bubble bath, spa music and massages
I have one Italian greyahound called poppy. Your dogs are sooo cute. Poppy is literally my best friend.
This just improved my day by like 100%
I'm living for this video❤️
8:09 the poor thing is gosh darn TRAUMATIZED
make bedding for you with julian🤐
That hurt me to see you break down. I know what it means to be worried about your dog and so thankful they're okay. I'm glad that in 2019, Marbles is still going strong
Marbles: Gets massage and a nice bath

Also Marbles: 👁👄👁
“Tough shit your still a part of the team”😂😂😂😂
Free ASMR SOUND 6:23
nobody:

marble: 👁👄👁
Now this is the quality content i signed up for💀
Do you know how nice it is to watch a drama-free YouTuber?
jenna: marbles actually is VERY furry
marbles:OwO?
This title is oddly specific,but I clicked
me: I wonder why kermit cries so much
Jenna: nasty! Ooooooh what a nasty boy, kermie
Peach meme: when you try to hide from your problems but then realize you are your problems😂😂😂
I died when Pineapple was humping Cemetery and then Juan Said, “Wait.” Then immediately cut to Jemma.
Kermit: exists
Jenna: ⁿᵃˢᵗʸ
I literally thought Cermit had dark grey hair. 
Well, he doesn't.
Huh.
we need more marble baths. that was the most precious thing i've ever watched
Alright, is it:
Kermit, Peach and Marble or Cermet, Paesh, and Bobbie?
Marbles always looks like he’s a soldier in the war and like he’s supposed to go into combat but he thought they were going to go to a beyblade competition and he is in the wrong place.
Your dogs are such memes
Peach: plz stop am being killed
I HURT MY FINGER THE SAME EXACT WAY THE DAY BEFORE A MEDICAL SCHOOL INTERNSHIP INTERVIEW LMAO
On a Jenna binge in May 2019... I can’t wait to see you give Bunny a bath! It’s gonna be hilarious 😂😂
Nasty boi using that walnut brain to figure out how to get the attention off marbles and onto him
why do i find this genuinely relaxing???
0:30
W a i t
nice bathroom 
weird pets
Am I the only one who loves that she’s so unique with her content? She could literally film a video of her singing hot cross buns for an hour and I’d still watch it

Like do you agree???
Marble at 8:11 is me every day
It feels like they’re being baptized with the music
I didn't think that Chihuahuas were cute until Mr. Marbles
1:05 I CANNOT OMG I REPLAYED IT LIKE 50 TIMES
the way kermit runs looks like a cartoon robber sneaking away
What if Kermit thinks NaStY is a compliment?
my god jenna is so sweet and TENDER it makes my black heart soar
Peach: humps Kermit
Jenna: my dogs smell like but....
Me:😂😂😂😂😂🤷‍♀️
I laughed soooooo hard!!! Omg especially when marbles had his turn. The close ups got me and Kermit crying during it.🤣😭
Next time fill the bath with Kermit's tears
I LOVE SQUAREMAT!!!!😍😍
1:55 I ask you😅YIAY
This video gives me the chills. It’s relaxing.
I bathed my dog yesterday. We don’t have a tub. He was laying on top of me, shaking and hiding his head under my arm. So cute but i was soaked
SEE YOU NEXT YEAR MAMA IMA MISS YOU
This actually relaxed me
I love Kermit so muCH OMG 😂😂
🍑 peach y  what are u doing 
0:30
I have a Pomeranian and takes a total of about 2-3 hours for him to completely dry even when I use a blow dryer. I also have to brush his hair daily and when I brush him he just wants to bite me.
8:50
Jenna: "Kermit is the most upset. I don't know why."
Kermit: angry glare
I always come back to this video when i’m stressed out and it helps every time
I wish I had dogs as calm as yours when it came to baths-
My dogs take 2 people to bathe them, one sitting in the tub with them holding them still, and the other actually washing 
I'm the holding still person and... I have a lot of scratches
8:01 is marble dead?
This is the cuttiest video in the world. Officially.♥️
Mr Marbles started licking peach I thought it was kinda funny
I love the sweater Jenna and Marbles makes the most random, relatable faces ever
I looove your videos with your dogs.  I love how you interact with them.  You treat those dogs better than I treat my child.  😂😂 (I do treat my child pretty decently too lmao)  too cute.
Jenna has lots of job
Salon 
Groomer
Artist
Soap cutter 
Give me more ideas in the comments
Marble is not a small angry cermet anymore. He is a small happy painfree cermet now.
I love Kermit please keep him safe he just needs courage at all times🥰😘
Jenna is one of the best dog owners I know.
Also that part with peaches was heart warming and sad.
1:36 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕒𝕣𝕖 𝕥𝕙𝕖 𝕟𝕒𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕖𝕤𝕥 𝕓𝕠𝕚 𝕠𝕗 𝕒𝕝𝕝
“dOnT DiSTuRb HiM HeS slEepIngl“    shakes violently  😂
1:55 Asked you. Boom fix your sentence.
marbles is the most appreciative dog and i love him very much
I don't understand why I enjoyed this so very much. <3
Klondike and sundae MASTER race
Holy shit mr. marbles' little tongue is the cutest thing I've seen
The love and adoration in each of those dogs' faces was just too cute for words. My heart is so full.
I just noticed (in 2019) that Jenna is wearing a Christmas sweater with two rain deer dogs humping each other I'm pretty sure that's peach and kermit😂😂 leave a like if u noticed it too
👇🏻
this honestly was so relaxing thank you jenna
1:08 This part makes me cry
Lol fun fact the spa music is the same music I listen to when I fall asleep an night 😂😂
I love how nobody is talking about Jenna’s jumper😂
7:30 sooo cuuuuuuuuute
I don't understand why I'm literally dying of laughter 😂😂😂😂
7:20 marbles just remembered it’s kermit’s nastyy water that’s being poured over him 😂
Kermit's facial expressions... Every time 😂😂
This video is borderline ASMR
ah yes, Cement, Watermellon and Goldfish having a wholesome spa day.
0:31 omg I'm dying 😂😂
Jenna: is being loving and caring
Marbles: °^°
There’s a whole lot of nasty in this video
i just love that kermit’s nickname is pretty much “nasty”
Kermit is a nasty boy but also loves soap does not compute...🤔🤔😐
The music was actually really nice and I'm happy you got it so that me and cermet can relax and enjoy (Kermit)
The combination of the spa music and the shots of Marble actually made me cry.. I can't believe this
$25 on royalty free spa music well spent, Jenna
Watching marble be so relaxed and appreciative of his bath is so peaceful, I could fall asleep to that
i feel absolute relaxation with this vid dahell goin on
When you said tiny walnut brain and kept booping their little heads, all I could think about was the TRex scene from Land of the Lost 😂😂😂
Not to be dramatic but I’d die for peach
THE WAY THEY LOOK AT YOU WITH SO MUCH LOVE AND TRUST MELTS MY HEART EVERYTIME I WATCH THIS OR ANY OTHER VIDEOS WITH THE DOGS AHHHH
THIS is most relaxing video I've ever seen;)
Legit a music video ad played before this video lol
Marbles is the only dog that doesn’t care just wants love 💖
MARBLES LITTLE TONGUE I CANT LOL HES SO CUTE
Ahhh your dogs are so innocent and pure 😆

Except Cermit....he nasty
Grocery list:
Miss weach
Julien

This was a very peaceful video. Thank you
Peach acts as I she hadn't had a bath In years
This is now my official getting ready video 🐶💜
Peach hugging Jenna almost made me cry. It was too cute.
Why does marbles looks so attacked coming out of the bath 😂
nasty become clean 2019 cholara ized
Who are the 1.5k I do its who disliked this video is great keep it up Jenna
“Kermit you screaming is not a part of the royalty-free spa music” 😂😂😂😂🤣
All of Jenna’s videos have such a weird energy and I love it
miss weach is an underrated queen
this video made me cry bc miss weach made me think of my lil abby who passed away a few years ago 
may she rest in peace ❤️
Marbles is the cutest little fluff, and those faces he made were priceless <3
Viewers: give us quality content
Jenna: HERE'S EVERYDAY THINGS EVERYONE DOES
Viewers: I AM LIVING FOR THIS KWEEN
This felt like ASMR ;)
Aaawwwwww mr marble. So cute. Glad to hear that he is happy!
PEACHY JUST LOVES HER MOM AND SHE WANTED HER BECAUSE SHE WAS SCARED! omg i cannot
Kermet was crying most of this video.






(Sorry if I spelled that wrong)
Please give us your Bloopers from 2018!? I love those videos.
THE DEAD ONE'S ALIVE!
9.56>10.01= infinite respect
Jenna loving her dogs for 9:55 minutes
this legally counts as ASMR
I think Jenna might be one of the most benevolent human beings on the planet.  Seriously.
I own a Staffordshire bull terrier who weighs in at 26 kilos. I envy how you can just pick up your dogs one-handed XD XD
Best and worst way to spend 10 minutes of my life
Nobody:
Kermit:*screaming*
You do realise that Peachie-gurl is 100% cat, right? She's got a great disguise, but legit, full on cat.
This is possibly the most simultaneously ridiculous, wholesome, and adorable thing on the internet
Kermits facial expressions 😂😂
Sometimes when I'm stressed, I come back and watch this video, it's so soothing.
Laying with my dog watching you bath your dog. Quality content. 10/10 would watch again.
Marbles looks like a cat when you wash them if you have a cat you know
I'm glad that Marble is much better. This was a lovely video. ❤ Merry Christmas to y'all.
1:20 I can't tell if the look in Kermit's eyes is love or contempt
be careful not to use too much soap on them, the skin can dry out
why is this actually so relaxing and wholesome
Peach need jesus like naw girl!
Literally the first frame of marble he looks so much happier and that makes me exponentially happy wow
Omg we need more of ur dogs!!!! I love them
8:18 - Jedi Marbles
Marble is so good I love him so much 
Jenna always hates cermet when he wants attention around marble
Julian’s commentary and video zooming is everything
I love the videos with ur dogs! Do more❤️
I felt sad when peach was against her chest in the bath because ahe was so scared but it was so cute



She was hiding from her problems and that was also sad
Rip she didn’t know there’s music that helps dogs relax xd
6:17 Kermit shaking off water sounds like Bob Ross beating the devil out of his brush.
Awh Marble 😭💗 his little smile
Peach is too cuuuute :33333
I love you so much, but you need to wash their faces. lol. I’ve been in the dog grooming business for almost 11 years. You did an amazing job either way. I suggest you keep up on bathing them at home. Just because Cermet and Peach seem to have a lot of anxiety and Marble is old. The grooming experience is very stressful for doggos. I love you all so much. This isn’t me trying to me rude. But just trying to help you out a little.
Also you shouldn’t be using a hairdryer on Marbles. He’s super old and if he’s not deaf already than can really damage his ears. 

I know you probably won’t see this. But I’m hoping by some weird chance you will. If you need anymore advice contact me on IG: August Nachos. 

LOVE YOU ❣️
0:32 tho the music I. The background
Not sayin you should dress Marble up like a nun, but you should you dress Marble up like a nun
kermits that one always loved sibling but the number one sibling to be picked on because he’s NASTY
I watch her videos when I need to relax and feel like all is right with the world.
Tiny dog muscles🤣💓
Idk why, but I laughed too hard at this
I love how all of Jenna's titles are the exact opposite of clickbait
what kind of dog is mr. marble?
a DiP iN tHE pOoL a TrIP tO ThE sPa
Marbles is so adorable, I just love him! ♥
I fully expect you to use this $25 royalty-free spa music in 2019.
This is so sweet!! 😭 this is the video I never knew I needed. The royalty free spa music and sweet talking the dogs  is the stress relief I need.
I watched this while drunk, highly recommend !
9 minutes and 55 seconds of Jenna being salty about paying $25 for royalty-free music
this is the purest thing on YouTube
7:05 ‘I just did this but I’m still gonna come ask you what’s happening’
Marbles looked lika TACOO
remember when Peach and Kermit got married?
Marbles is so pure I’m going to die 😭🖤
omg love this clickbaitless title thou lmao
When you started the music I think it turned peach on because she started humping Kermit😝🤣🤣
Mr. Marbles makes me so happy.
THEM TINY LIPS JENNA 😂😂😂😂😂
Marbles  Looks like he came back to life
4:28 the panic in mango’s eyes, she’s seen what 2019 is like
The nasty dog is like ok I give up my life!!!.....
I would not only die, but also kill, for Marbles.
peach: will jump into pool and swim 

also peash: is scared of 2 inches of water
we truly don't deserve you. thank you from the bottom of my heart.
She’s so nice to her dogs I love it but Kermit is my favorite ❣️
Kermit seemed jealous lol i loved every minute of this. This is what jeffree star needs to film is his dog routines lol
When peach hid in your arm I was dying of cuteness and felt bad she was so cute
Is that spa music royalty free?
You are actually the queen of everything Jenna
Raven : ur my little nasty 
.
.
😂😂😂
I can never tell if marbles is smiling or unconscious...
I LOVE your dogs MORE then YOU!!!♥♥♥♥♥
Alright, why is no one talking about peach. She was absolutely adorable and I cried.
I think marbles needed this spa day the most. And I think he genuinely enjoyed it
Who is here in 2019?
Your dogs are so adorable ❤️👍😂
NASTY BOI!!!
Marbles is the only chihuahua dog I like
7:04. Instagram users watching their friends post while they still have to wait for theirs to come back up
Marble seems much more alive now!!!
Sweet marbles :')
Kermit: distrubes marbles
Marbles:👁👄👁
Marbles the only one who truly enjoyed the spa
“Kermit, you screaming is not part of the royalty-free spa music.”
Selfish Jenna content is the best content
The first time I bathed my dog, I played spa music and diffused essential oils for her because she seemed nervous...but then I discovered she’s deaf. Hopefully she could feel the chill vibes and good intentions lol.

P.S. ONESIES FOREVER!!!
Dis is some good ASMR right here.
marbles and cement always look high
I never thought s video of dogs getting a bath could be so relaxing.
Ok but peach cuddling up to Jenna while she was in the bath was actually the cutest thing ever
nasty cermit: flaps wetly
I use a rubber dog brush to scrub my Italian Greyhound with during baths.  I was surprised how well it worked and how much she enjoyed the scrubbing.  I also hold a folded dry washcloth over her eyes while rinsing.   It really calms her down.   She acts like taking a bath is The Most Stressful Anxiety-producing Activity IN THE WORLD.
Marbles never looked dead-er
Paesh! Stap trying to hump Cermet!
Tell the Debbie Machine we said Merry Christmas beeeech
Weeep sadly it’s not 10 mins
Honestly guys we have to stop with the marbles is dead joke because now he is actually getting pretty old. So it's just sad.... so please stop
I have watched this video so many time I don’t know why but I find it so entertaining
I love your dogs. My whippet does the same thing as Peaches when you start getting her wet.
This was the MOST relaxing video I have EVER watched!
watching you with your furbabies has made me a better dog owner
У меня сегодня такой стрессовый день, но когда я смотрю на них, я и сама расслабляюсь😂😂🤣
Been watching your videos since marble was a baby.. can’t believe how much time has passed! You’re still my fav YouTuber
Why isn't anyone talking about Peach at 0:30
Or the fact that Jenna's sweater with reindeers having the it
i feel like a grandmother who’s just been sent videos of her grandchildren getting their first baths
i will find you, and i will have you give my dog a nice relaxing bath at the salon
6:21 😂
Peach is scared of the bathtub of clean water, but excited to play in the toxic smelling pool.
8:17 Jenna is drying Marbles with an IKEA bath mat LOL I love this
omg they are all so cuteee! ❤️👏
Jenna can honestly make a video about eating grapes and i’ll be down 👏🏽keep👏🏽doing👏🏽you👏🏽sis👏🏽
Why is this video so heartwarming to me ❤❤❤
I've never seen Peach be so sweet in my life.
I feel like Jenna is always high, only because this is something I would do if I were really stoned 😂
This is relaxing
Royalty free spa music but instead the spa music sound is just Kermit screaming or crying and it still costs $25
What is peach doing. I’m am confused
Lovely Christmas sweater there, jenna
i'm giving a like to this video for your sweater
I could watch these dogs forever theyre so cute❤
This woman and her dogs are a gift from God
lol kermit is sad cause u took away his 
nasty
The cermits no like being submerged in the waters they wont grow
Jenna: Kermit it time for you to no longer be nasty

Kermit: I WANT TO BE NASTY BOI!!!!!
What type of dog is Marble. He is soo adorable and tiny I LOVE it. 😍 love you Marble and the rest of the fam!!!
7:28 made me tear up..
I don’t know what but the way Marbles just slowly turns his head towards Jenna and how meaningful and heartfelt and emotional his gaze is towards his mom and the way Jenna says “hi honey” in a sweet soft tone. Marbles stare wasn’t just some crossed-eyed dog eyes, it had actual sincerity behind it like he’s trying to say thanks mom for taking care of me, giving me a bath, helping with my teeth, making me feel better just...UUUGGHH ITS SO BEAUTIFUL I NEEDED THIS VIDEO
Holy orange makeup, Batman!! Girl, you need to pick wayyyy lighter colors and tone down the cakeness!
Don't disturbe him he's sleeping 
disturbes him
Kermit... SHhhHhHhhHhhHH
Do a Kermit ASMR lol
are you ready for the tiny man of the hour lol old man marbles is so adorable love him
I straight up thought that marbles was fat.. but hes actually just fluffy. Like he has so much fur.. my bad.
i tried to stay up late and this almost made me fall asleep
Jenna: don’t disturb him he’s sleeping 

Kermit: *flaps ears in disturbance *

Marble: where am I
blessed video,,..,....,,,..,,,,...,.,..
Marbles honestly does look a bit more alert now. He must have been having a heck of a time with his mouth troubles before his surgery. Also, I want your gigantic bathtub.
2:17 ME! UH MY TURN? ME KNOW!!
What a beautiful and tender intimate moment?
Hi
What type of dog is he?
Jenna:
0:01 Jenna being a beauty guru
0:18 Jenna being a good mother

2019 May 20
Everyone is fangirling over marbles and than I’m just here silently fangirling over mrs Weach
This is the content I subscribed for
what did we ever do to deserve jenna, julien, marbles and the iggys? they just out here chillin and making everyone’s life better

also the way her dogs look at her gives me life, they trust her so much
Strange thing to thing about: these dogs have no idea how much they mean too so many people
this is the wholesome content that im here for
I think I found this more relaxing then your dogs did
What an unproblematic Queen
completely caught off guard by the two deer f#!@ing on her b00bs.
Peach just wants to be a land shark, not a bath shark. 🦈
0:30 Ms Peachy being so lady like! Lololol! Also the whole time watching, I wanted to rip your watch off and roll your sleeves alllll the way up! I just can’t deal!!! lol!
I love how you call him nasty boy with such love lol you are amazing really loving your channel lately
Awww I love them so much!
this is my favourite video on the Internet
why am i crying
any one 2020
4:04 did i hear a phone go off?
January 9th, 2019 is the day I concieved. Should've been watching a wholesome Jenna video instead.
i love how Jenna's weirdness goes from 0 to 100 real quick
kermit always looks like he's on the verge of crying and if that ain't the 2018-mood idk what is
Marble is such a sweetie.
Honestly, you can watch any Jenna marbles video and it would be good
I didn’t know I needed this
peach is so happy oh lord
Is it just me or does marble look happier or acting like he his happier
This is the content i subscribed for
I love this wholesomeness!! #nastyboi
I love how peachy was humping Kermit instead of the other way around
I feel very relaxed now!
I legit got teary eyed at 7:27 because of the way Marbles looked up at Jenna with such loving eyes 😢😢 AND THEN KERMIT MADE IT ABOUT HIMSELF
This is the best video on the internet by an extremely large margin
Jenna is my spirit animal.
People say marbles is dead. He is not. He just has no clue what is going on or where he is. Basically he is dead inside, but not truly dead
It is important to water your cermit it will help it grow
This video is 👌 with headphones.
asmr has entered the chat
im gonna be really sad when marble dies....he's to cute
I absolutely adore marbles.
I can't get over how CUTE marbles is 😭
Your dog videos just make me so happy when I’m sad or in a bad mood 😆 💕
Jenna and Juliens children

Marbles: The good boi 
Peach: The really needy hugger but is also a good gorl 
Kermit: The attention seeking nasty boi that never listens
XD I love your jumper
Peachy is the cutest dog ever.
Marbles descending into the tiny bath is a 2019 mood - claws out, feeling vulnerable and naked
So when can we expect a royalty free doggy spa ASMR video? ;D <3
This video actually relaxed me as well...
This is actually really relaxing
why did this make me feel sleepy?
I almost cry watching Marbles, he is such a good boy
This is like legit so relaxing
Im getting a dog if I get a's and b's (im 12) I was wondering what breed. Marble and kermit is! ❤️ I want that breed x)
Any videos with good dogs is a HELLA GOOD VIDEO!!! Do you guys agree?
Peachy is literally my dog when she gets a bath. I have to feel sooo guilty every time
Why did I find this so relaxing and entertaining???
It’s so sad seeing marble being so old
I need more marbles content
the love she has for her dogs is the type of love im looking for 😭🥵
I love her dogs. So cute and hilarious😂
jenna: 
marbles: pokes tongue out left side of mouth
peach humping kermit made me snort, shes such an ALPHA FEMALE
i have 5 german shepherds, giving just one a bath means i am sore (whole body) and I can barely move my back xD, these guys are so small it looks so easy xD
Me trying act normal around my mum 0:31

Marble has no soul
6:42 SUPER MARBLE
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to Jenna, Julien, Mr. Marbles, Miss. Peach, and lil Nasty Boy. See y’all in 2k19
the beginning makes me feel like shes about to put them down. ive had to put down 3 pets in my life, and i just get those vibes. but more peaceful. oddly makes me emotional. love you jenna.
This is SO HARD TO WATCH!!
Lmao there is a pet value ad
dont use perfume or scented soaps on a working dog. paris hiltons dog doesnt have to smell for a living
Plot twist:
Kermit is a white boi but he's grey because of all his nastiness
Peach's head looks like a chicken nugget not in a mean way but in a cute way btw iz angie
whenever kermit shakes his body he sounds like those plastic hand slappy things
the video i did not think i needed
“Hey Olivia what did you do all day?”
“Oh nothing weird. Just binge watched all of Jenna Marbles videos with her dogs. It was a fun time”
Put Kermit Peach and Marbles in green suits so only there faces are showing and put them in front of a green screen
i cant wait for the disaster of washing bunny
That music is worth $25????!??! I could've bought robux with that...
i don't know why this video was so relaxing to me... "my dogs smell like butt."
This video is hilarious and relaxing at the same time!
Have a nice Christmas and New Years Jenna and Julien! Enjoy your time off, we will miss yall!
Kermit looks like me after staying up until 3 am and then waking up at 7.
Cuter
than my dog
Marble is my favorite
0:32 Me:Wai- Wut..? O-O xD
Peach being afraid of the bath is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
3:20 looks like peach is having a mental breakdown
Whenever i am sad i watch these videos
marbles is very important to me
Why am I sobbing at the way they all look at Jenna?! They love her so much 😭😭😭😭😭❤️
every time Cermet shakes his fur it sounds like Bob Ross abusing his paintbrush.
Peach- ahh so cute-
Julien seemed very confused when he filmed Peach humping Kermit but I think it was Jennas sweater which encouraged her to do that with the royalty free spa music in the backround.
What kind of dog is peach, Cermit and marbles?
Mr. Marble is the only one that appreciates your gifts
Deceptively relaxing
Ive never seen cement so calm.
I know this comment is a little late but I am looking back at this and I am still very happy that marbles has recovered and has lived the bestest life he could live
Marbles wrapped up like a burrito in that towel is what I aspire to be in life
does anyone else notice the deer on her sweater...isnt life beautiful
Kermit wheezing and crying is me after I go allll the way to the fridge and allll the way back
The edit at 5:39 XD
These videos are so random but i love them hahaha
kermit don’t disturb him, he’s sleeping!
disturbs him
Unfocusing on Peach makes her look like a misshapen horse
0:31 The roles are reversed.
0:31 killed me 😂😂
“Welcome to the spa”
the sound of kermit shaking the water off sounds like bob ross beating the devil out of his paint brush
Marbles is the cutest wet squirrel I've ever seen
Marbles thinks he’s going down the drain. My chihuahua HATES having a bath 🛀 xxxx they are all so good and look at you lovingly though, or that could be immense hate lol 😂 either way they love 💖 you mummy
Nobody:
Marbles: 👁👅👁
Peach 🍑 says she has a stress spot too mummy. Honest xxx
MARBLES WAS SO F L O O F WHEN HE WAS DONE BEING BLOW DRIED
This was a really reallllllllllly relaxing video!!! I Love it! xoxo
Girl be careful with their ears
This may have been a year of selfish content but this was the best year of content for you.
Kermilita: molds into ball of nasty and evaporates
Why is peach humping Kermit isn’t it supposed to be the other way around?🤔
This was honestly so cute
Kermit: 😢
Jenna: kermit shhhHHHHHHHHHHHH >:(
These dogs are more pampered than I ever will be
💪👀
     👗
     👢

Watched the whole 9 minutes and 55 seconds of this video because I love her dogs
Was Peach  just humping Kermit side 0-0
jenna will be a good mother and no one can disagree
CEMENT LOOKS LIKE SQUIRREL FROM ICE AGE
Why is this the content I need at midnight 🤔
0:30 is nobody gonna talk about that?
Soooooooo is no one gonna address her humping dog jacket
I know it's probably merch but
That is funny AF to me
#prayfornasty2k19
“are you running away from your problems”
i’m so glad mr marbles is okay
I love  marbles ignorance to everything
I bathe 3 pitbulls lol and they do not love the water 😂
Awww, your doggies are so cute!!🐕🐩
Marble is the sweet boi
"I racked a 20 lbs dumbbell on my finger"
"I thought I had severed my finger"

Has only a band-aid on the injury
Such wholesome content <3
😂😂 I'm frign DEAD! 😂😂
We as a fan base do not appreciate peach enough
Me in my house: 8:08
Me leaving my house: 8:10
Jenna (in a relaxing voice) : 
You smell like the dead things you roll around in 

Me : idk if I’m related or disturbed
Peach is scared of the tub but not the pool😂😂
These are not dogs lol, more like rats
Okay I don’t care what other people think anymore
I watch this video at least once a week. Idk why????
jenna's audience is literally marble. extremely chill, positive, angelic, and appreciative of their mother.
aw marbles is smiling :) he’s happy
Kermit is worth more then only 25$
I swear Kermit is on crack
Why
Cant
I
Just
Keep
Kermit
And
Marbles
0:31 ain't strawberry a girl🤨🤔
I want a marbles in my life
I'm surprised cement smells the worst  he is constantly rubbing his face in irish spring
Marble said 👁👅👁
Peach hugging you in the bath 😭💗
In Japan we have natural hot springs bath both for humans and for dogs 😂😁✨
Peach trying to hump Kermit😂
Whenever creators do whatever they want it's always more enjoyable for viewers as well. Because they are just more genuine, real, and relatable. We can get to know them and feel close to them. This is very evident in Jenna's content this year and also in Pewdiepie's newer content.  I just love them more as people. Keep doing your thing Jenna, we love you for you. :)
“contrary to your tiny walnut brain”
3:59 Looks so sad 😢
I needed this.
My dog was dead like marbles and turned out he needed some teeth pulled and $2000 later and a few months he went from 8 pounds to 10 pounds and now he is obese and much happier since his teeth arent hurting him anymore. Hes turning 11 on January 16th wish Max a happy birthday!!!!
Marble looks like a tiny hyena 💖
marbles was a fish in previous life.
My dog. He’s big tho. He hates baths
jenna's gonna be the best mom omg
This has just become a channel about your dogs








& I love it
We love a good baff for a good boi
Peach is so freaking cute oh my gosh
These dogs deserve a 2018 Christmas photo shoot . I’m talking red silk and a warm fireplace with Kermit’s watery glistening 80s teenage heartthrob eyes and peach’s  2 inch of cleavage and then there’s marbles... all smiles and all gums like the most proud grandpa.
This is the content I like to see 😌🐶
Marble looks constantly shook all the time and that's a mood
OMG MARBLE IS SO CUTE I CANT GET OVER IT RN!!!
👁👅👁
the fact that marble is so old now is literally breaking me i feel like he’s my pup too and i’ve seen him grow. well. crying in the club rn
i started massaging my dog when you did
Why was the ending so sweet?
Lol I just noticed what’s on her sweater 😂
your dogs have it better than me lol
Jenna’s “Selfish” videos are my favorite to watch
i think connecticut has a low key crush on jenna
I dont mean to be bias but marble is my favorite Jenna doggo
Jenna your wings could but a b*tch 😂
Da sweater tho
Jenna insulting kermit in a sweet loving voice is exactly how my mom talks to me
Aww cutest video
8:15 marble becomes the evil kermit the frog meme
It was so funny that she knew that the ear of marble would get his tounge out 😂😂
Selfish? More like wholesome way to end the year
Can we please get royalty free spa music with cermet crying in the back
Kermit is my spirit animal 😂
Jenna: "I am one of those people"
Julien : *laughs*
Jenna: " why are you laughing"
Marbles in the bath was a level of peace I will never achieve
I thought the title said 'Giving my dogs a bra-'
Gina Merballs whashing xemerts for 9 minutes straight
Marble IS SO CUTE
marbles got cuter without teeth
Peachy is so cute
Marbles is my fav
I aspire to live like marbles
Can we get some Rochester hype in the chat?
Anyone else think it looks like Marbles is smiling ?? I’m so glad he got the surgery he looks so happy 😭 1:02
Peach molesting her older brother, Kermit wall is mighty interesting.
i have a dog that looks just like peach but she was abused when she was younger and now is scared of everything :(
When dogs show emotions like fear and they hide in their owners chest it makes me love dogs so much more.
“Kermit move” (doesn’t move ) Kermit has me dying lol
It makes me really happy to see the old man relaxed after his surgery I’m glad he’s doing okay
GIVE ME marbles
the way peach tries to hug jenna when shes scared is so adorable I can't-
6:10 to 6:14 was genuinely the best part of my year. Kerm may be a nasty but that’s pure love in his watery eyes. This was just the pure essence of precious and the best way to end the year. It isn’t selfish at all cuz it’s just genuine Jenna, Julien, and the pups. Quality content, no sarcasm.
6:22 don’t disturb him he’s sleeping runs all the way over to him to violently shake as loud as possible
Керамзит смешная подыхающаяся собака
please do this more. this was so nice to watch
Marbles looks so dead while washing.
I love how Jenna was just calmly roasting her dogs about how they smell
3:27 my dog is literally the same XD
8:17 OMG MARBLES IS A BURRITTO
peach is the only one who isn't perpetually depressed every day
Wait this is really wholesome...
I've been so depressed and honestly jenna helps me get through my day. Thank you jenna for being a 32 year old lady who does what she wants and bathes her dogs to royalty free spa music
Marbles looks like he is smiling at the beginning
If you get water in their ears it can give them an infection my mans
But that's not a towel that's a carpet O_O
Did you mean Jeena Mumbles washes two fleshy turkeys and a weird bean thing
what kind of dogs are those they're adorable, I know the one is a chihuahua but the other ones
Okay. I have insane ocd when it comes to makeup. And I want to clean all those brushes. Let me Jenna I'll clean all those brushes for free. Cleaning brushes is fun to me lol
Why does 5:40 make me laugh so hard? XD
Oh my marbles was sooo cute
Jenna marbles deserves everything good in the world


edit-ok usually I find it slightly annoying when people are like "tHaNKsfOrAlLThELikES" but for real what the heck I've never been this famouse before
Could you could film an uncut unedited vid of marbles being bathed please?
Kermit: does no bath cries
Kermit: gets bath cries
Kermit is done with bath still cries
why was i so relaxed watching this
Marbles is as alive as can be
little marbles is so old im crying
Love you sweatshirt
anyone else acknowledge Jennas Onesie? 😂
who disliked this?
Awe peach was so cute
I love that we support our mom with literally any video she posts. She could upload a video of herself eating cereal for 15 mins and we'd be in the comment section like: "SUCH A GOOD CRUNCH AT _:_"
Edit: I’m so glad you guys love this comment 😂 JENNA START OFF 2019 EATING CEREAL!!!
why didnt you just wash the nasty with some Irish spring, might have subdued the crying but probably not
where can i get that onesie
Kermit looks happy and did a good job. Those are awesome dogs.
Clone Kermit and give the cloned version to me
Is no one gonna mention the fact that Jenna’s wearing a Christmas onesie with reindeers banging?
OH NOES ITS DE NASTYBOI
My chihuahua is super similar to marbles
6:23 is the funniest part of the whole video 😂
Peach is the most wholesome dogj
Too mach wutor wil not halp ur Cermet graow.
Its 2019 now!!!!!!!!!😊😊😊😊😊😊😍😍😍😍😍
I was confused because you put marble in kermit's water that was dirty but near the starting of the video u said you wouldn't ?
Marble I hope you don't die soon, even though you are dead inside
Someone, just someone, Saw What She had on
You should have washed Kermit with Irish spring then maybe he wouldn't be so upset?
I massage my cat 😂
Jenna- Kermit shhHHHHHHHHHHH
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Marble is so cute aww
5:37 the best sequence 😂
Any one else crying at how cute Marbles is?
Jenna’s love and care for her dogs is some BEAUTIFUL shit on another level
near the end of the video, I saw the design of her PJ
0:31 wait I thought Peach was a girl?
Marbles looks like e.t. But cuter
peach hiding was the most precious thing i’ve ever seen i was yodeling
The dogs look so old😢😐
You give cats a bath!?
0:32 wut the frick peach
You never gave peach a mashash
My favorite thing about you and Julien is how genuine you are and how you are so willing to share and be transparent with us. Don't feel bad Jenna, and I hope Marbles gets back to feeling like the fiery little guy he is!
Jenna: He lost his teeth *Gives attention to Marbles "
Marbles: :C 
Kermit: Peach, help me rip off my teeth
All the dislikes are Marbles teeth
Is it insensitive that she wanted to be a toothbrush?
literally nothing: 
kermit: rRHEEEEHHHEEEEEHHEhheheEHehheEHE
Me : I kinda wanna see his toothless mouth
Jenna: I’m not gonna show you the inside of his mouth, you sickos
Me: oh
put his food in a food processor. like he can lick it because it would be powdery. please LIKE this so jenna can see :)
I think it is time we stop with “marbles is dead” because he is getting older and he’s fading more. Jenna’s channel has Marbles’ name in it and when he passes it will be extremely sad, so can we please stop?
Dont feel bad or guilty for not posting. Its not always about us subscribers. Dont feel guilt for doing things for yourself of your dogs or family. Never apologize for doing whats right for you. Enjoy yourself on this break and love up on your toothless marbles and everyone on this end will be fine with that 💕
MAKE MARBLES LISTEN TO “All I want for Christmas are my two front teeth”
DO NOT FEEL BAD FOR WANTING TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR PRECIOUS TOOTHLESS DOGGO INSTEAD OF ENTERTAINING US!!
Jenna: I appreciate you
Kermit: auhuhagu
Jenna: oh for the love of god
😂😂😂
just reading the description made me cry

get well soon mr.marbles you dink little doggo
I still can't get over how much Kermit's face reminds me of Vladimir Putin. Hope Marbles feels better.
Jenna. I don't know if you realize how much impact you have on us viewers over the years. Thank you for honoring Mac. You are #goals.
No apologies needed. We love you. We love Marbles and the whole pup family. I, for one, appreciate the check-in with Marbles. I think Kermit is just worried about Marbles. He doesn't know what to do with his feelings.
im thorry marbleth i hope you feel better thoon
For your last video of 2018 could you have your basketball game?
Did anyone else also get the dentist ad? It's like YouTube knows.
I can’t believe I’ve been watching marbles for 80% of his life. Keep up the good work Mr Marbs
Jenna:This dog has no teeth and Kermit still thinks it's about him
Kerm:*scoffs in middle child, and then cries*
I'm sorry about marbles and I'm also sorry about your friend! May he rest in peace 💙
For your next video you should dress marble up as toothless from how to train a dragon
my dog is 18 and has been toothless for so long, now he just gums his food and bones
he still lookin thicc
No apology necessary, family comes first. I understand and I'm sure everyone else does too.
In Russia, too, are worried about the old man Marbles
we love u

everything will be fine
1 like = 1 new tooth for marbles
My parents dog ended up toothless and my mum had to feed her with a fork 😂 you are right it is so funny she bit my finger once with no teeth and it was the grossest thing ever and she lived to be 18 😊
Marbles is more important then making a video 

Even for your videos 
Take care of them guuuurl
not to be dramatic or anything but i would literally sacrifice my soul for marbles
Выздоравливай милый старичок Марблс
It never occurred to me that your channel name was JennaMARBLES AS IN YOUR DOG WOAH
Я надеюсь,что всё будет хорошо...
Cricket sound.  I thought it was in my room.   Lol
Marbles: has all of his teeth taken out
Kermit: still whiniest dog in the house
Honestly just who disliked this and why?
I became a fan because I loved your dog videos. As far as I am concerned, you never have to apologize for taking care of them.
I wish him the best in recovery.
This apology is still better than Laura Leech
Sending love to Marbles, to you and Julien, and to the friends and family of your former roommate. And especially to Kermit because of course it's about him.
He looks so poorly. Poor Marbles. Hope you’ve been cuddling him and holding him 24/7. Bless him. You and Julien are such good parents. ❤️
How to train your marble. 
Toothless the dog > Toothless the dragon. 💜
I love how in EVERY video there is a crying dog
Marbles does seem much happier now that he's a toothless man.
How To Train Your Cermet.






I'm Late
Uwww i hope mr marbles feels better after getting them out


Btw im livin for those PJ's
марблс лучший
No need to feel guilty xoxo we love you and the entire marbles family.  Happy holidays enjoy your break
Marble: has surgery, no more teeth, suffering
Kermit: no surgery, normal teeth, absolutely fine...crying
I checked the fan wiki on marbles, it said his behaviour was corpselike
Марблс, держись, мы с тобой!
Sorry for your loss. 
I hope the rest of your holiday is filled with love and peace.
Попробуйте напоить его при помощи шприца (без иглы разумеется ). И покормить детскими пюре , так же при помощи шприца. 
Скорейшего выздоровления мистеру Марбалсу 💚💚💚
marbles might have pain in his mouth but kermit has pain in his heart
Aww praying for lil marbles that he feels better soon <3
Ааа, бедный Марблс, так жалко его, это такой стресс, рада, что Марблс в хороших руках. Дженна такая молодец!!
RIP to your friend Mac! Glad Marbles is doing better now. <3
We with you. From Russia 🇷🇺
God I’m so emotionally invested in this chihuahua
PLEASE MAKE A REMAKE OF LAND SHARK 🤘🏝️🦈
еле удержалась, чтоб не заплакать. держу кулачки за марблса. надеюсь с ним все хорошо 🤞🏻
Don’t feel bad for loving your dogs and wanting to take care of them!
Next video: Making my dog some dentures.
You know, Kermit could have been sad for Marbles
Smol boi no longer has teef. So sad.
You REALLY need to put Marbels on a iRobot!!!
Awww. Poor Mr. Marbles. Definitely should not feel bad or overly apologize for taking care of him.
Marbles is now the physical representation of “all bark and no bite”
Русские зрители, думаю, также переживают за этого малыша(
Jennaaaa, when are you gonna react to all the Beard Horror edits??

Also, poor Marbles, I hope he’s doing okay and he feels better soon.
:( poor bby marbles
Marbles is immortal we all know that
January 9th 2019
Jenna Marbles has uploaded a new video
“Making my dog fake teeth because he has none”
My Chihuahua is also old and toothless😀 but she figured out how to eat. She eats hard dogfood like a normal dog.
Love you Marbs ❤️
JENNNA YOU NEED TO DO A VIDRO DOING DIY HAIR DAZZLES PLZ
💕💓💕
I love you Jenna ❤️❤️❤️ merry Christmas!!!
You mistake Cermet's sounds for crying but actually he is singing a healing song for Marbles.
Марблс  Украина с тобой=)
TOOTHLESS THE NIGHT FURY

Beautiful darling. Bless marbles xoxoxox
Such a good pupper mommy! Hope lil marbles recovers quickly!
Mr. marbles you can look forward to your tongue never again staying in your mouth. 

You can learn from my toothless chihuahua, Harrison ❤️
She's so sweet  and I'm so happy she took the time to do this and to  spend time with her family  💞 .. this video was genuinely  so beautiful  😭
Now waiting patiently for a "what I feed my toothless dogs" video
How dare you prioritize your family over your job 😹 
We all adore you and your 4-legged family. I think it’s great that you’re taking care of them first because that’s exactly how it should be.

Get well soon Marbles!! 💜
How sweet, he is so adorable!  God bless him!
keeping you & mac's family in my thoughts. well deserved break jenna <3
Ya'll joke all you want about Marbles looking dead but, all I know is, hes getting older and I am not gonna be ok when his time comes 😟😟😟 thats gonna be a gut wrencher. Love you Marble ❤
Kermit is going to rip out all his teeth so he can get all the attention
I hope he’s full recovered now 🥰❤️
Captions renamed Kermit to Karm so that's what I'm going with. 

Karm's a beech ynamysayin?
THATS BEAUTIFUL "marbles has been there for me for 10 years" so now you're there for him !!! Jeennaaaa  😭💕💕
Ayyeeee my birthday is on January 9th
And I hope mr. marbles will be okay❤️💕
You’re the best dog mom ever, tellin’ 18M+ people to chill while you snuggle your pupper. 👏🏻💕
Jenna as Tooth Fairy. 
I assume his teeth are going under a pillow for proper retrieval by the Tooth Fairy.
Don’t worry we love marbles much more than you
Dude, don't apologize! You're awesome!!!! You are an amazing dog owner :) He's lucky to have you both
Love you. This is the best thing.
cermet must get rid of taeth then mommai will love me
WE LOVE YOU AND MR MARBLES! 😭
Hey man life happens no worries on videos. Hope he's alright though!
marbles the toothless doggo
he lost all of his small teeth
Gizmo my border terrier/pug mix had to have 2 teeth pulled when we first rescued him 2 years ago. He says stay strong Marbles and enjoy all of that delicious soft food
They did surgery on a marble
Marbles needs a Toothless the dragon costume now, right? 🤔

In all seriousness though It's good to hear Marble will be feeling a bit better soon!
you don't need to apologize, we'll wait till you and Mr.Marbles feel better
my condolences for your loss
Dog videos are my absolute favorite videos. I live for those three 😂❤️
Don't apologize for taking care of the animals and people you love.  :)

Post when you can, but take care of you first.
next video: making tiny dentures for my dog
Yo you should do a Gore makeup look when you come back. Also I love your videos because I can't ever be sad or angry when I watch your videos. You have helped me through a lot. Thank you ❤️
Don’t apologize! Marbles needs you. I’ve loved him from the start, years and years ago when I started watching you. I hope he feels a lot better soon ❤️
Also, I’m glad Marbles is doing okay
And I’m sorry for the loss of your friend
You’re like Kesha and Kaley Cuoco or whatever mixed together. 10/10
Marbles just lost all his teeth and yet kermit still manages to make everything about himself.
i got a dentistry ad on this vid lmao
3:57 😶😐🤣🤣🤣😹🙈
I am like speechless, like......
I am dying laughing at Kermit's reactions and Jenna's face
So sorry for your loss and for the troubles with Marbles. Prayer for you and Your boo. And for marbles that he recovers quickly and as painlessly as possible. ❤️
I love that you put your dog first!!!!❤️❤️
every year marbles gets closer and closer to resembling toothless the dragon from how to train your dragon and this year he definitely peaked
poor marbles looks so 1000% done with everything :c PETS FOR MARBLES
Poor precious Marble breaking my heart. Hope he feels better soon!
Sitting here still waiting for that Rhine stone bald cap 💙💙
Kermit the empath, feeling everyone else's pain since c.2010.
So sorry to hear about Mac. Keep hugging that little marbles! We love you regardless!
I actually genuinely think Kermit is worried about Marbles and that's why he was like that! Dogs do definitely get that kind of bond together
Do what u gotta do Jenna, im wishing Marbles a quick recovery and sending u all love! 💕💕
Your doggies are so loved and have had such great lives. 💕
Don't be sorry about not making a regular video. Mr. Marbles is way more important. But obviously for next Halloween he needs to be Toothless the dragon.

P.s. I'm very sorry for the loss of your friend.
I got an ad for braces 🤦🏽‍♀️ glad to see Marbles is doing okay though and sorry about your friend ❤️
Huh. That's strange. Mr. Marbles doesn't look like Toothless to me.
He's too small and doesn't have wings.
Take your time beebee <3 We love you!! Best wishes to lil Marbles <3
I know I like to goof on Marbles' general lack of energy, but seeing this after seeing more recent videos, his sudden jump in perkiness makes a lot of sense. He was probably feeling I'll for a long time, and now the pain shards are gone, he's feeling very happy and excited. You made a good choice, Jenna, and I hope Mr. Marbles can continue to be confused by time floors and refuse to eat out of bowls for years to come.

I'm sorry about your friend.
No need for apologies, family/pets are important! A speedy recovery to little Marbles. 

Cermet crying for attention all the time legitimately reminds me of how my dog is.
I mean...technically you did post a video
We love you and the amazing, caring dog momma that you are. Your fur babies come first and I'm glad you're taking time to care for Marbles ❤
Same thing happened to one of my dogs, which unfortunately is no longer with us. I know how it feels.
Next week: dressing marbles up as a dragon and remaking ‘how to train your dragon’
"But also, it's hilarious"
Jenna is the best dog owner ever
Technically this is a video. Hopefully that will make you feel better. Hopefully he gets better ♥️
Don't feel guilty or feel the need to apologize. :) I think everyone understands it. I wish you and Marbles of course all the best. I am looking forward to the video this week and then merry Christmas and happy new year!
There was a dentures add that played in between the video 😂😭
Me: sees title 
Also me: click with speed of light
Family first. Don't apologize! Praying a speedy recovery for that little guy.
Marbles we love you!
I haven't been keeping track on ur yt videos. It's been yrs since I last watch a video of urs. U occurred in my mind and decided to see if u're still active. Now here I am & I'm 2 see glad mr.marbles still alive 😍😍😍 and kermit too
I love you and marbles, and I hope he feels better soon! Enjoy your time off!
Ow, my heart. Watching Marbles grow up from when he was a tiny tot to a toothless boy has me feeling all of the feels. I hope he's feeling better and enjoying all of the squishy foods soon <3
A video idea : taking kermit to therapist.
There's nothing more important that you hairy children. Saint Francis bless your baby's 🙏
Love the unicorns! I hope mr. Marbles feels better 😘
This is totally an OK video for you and your tiny family. I've been with you since you got Kermit in that video forever ago. And so I always wonder how he and Marbles are doing since they're becoming amazing senior dogs. I was not as fortunate with my senior cat but I'm so glad Marbles is doing OK!
The relationship that peach and marbles have is so fucking precious!!!!!  I love it sooo much, muh hearT 💗😩
jenna marbles being better at apologizing than every other youtuber for 4 minutes straight
Poor marbles, he's toothless! I hope he gets better soon, poor thing. And also I'm so sorry about your friend Mac, I've lost loved ones and I know how painful it is.
I do have a video idea though,  I know you made yourself into Kermit, but what if you transformed Julien into peach or Mr. Marbles, I think it would be so fun and I would love to watch something like that.
Everything is gonna be ok! You are fascinating
Why aren’t they married yet ...random but it just poped up 🤣
omg your apologizing for being amazing and taking care of mr marble please don’t!! jsksksk your so awesome and wholesome ily
He's a.... señor Chihuahua. 

Señor senior Chihuahua, Mr. Marbles.
Jenna you are such a genuine amazing ass person and I respect you so much. Best dog mom ever! And May your friend Rest In Peace.❤️❤️
wow! really good greenscreen job on the dog
Remember Mr. Lions? Almost 9 years ago?
Marbles is such a lump that my screen froze [audio kept going] on him in your lap and I didn't notice for a wicked long time XD
When we removed our chihuahuas teeth she completely changed. She was grumpy and we all could tell something was up with her but we just thought maybe she was getting old. We decided to bring her to the vet and get her teeth removed. When we brought her home it was a week of pain and torture and her getting used to only having gums but then something happened. Her coat became so shiny and healthy and she became so happy. She would run around in the backyard again with the other dogs and play with toys. She would smile with no teeth and it was the cutest thing in the world because we’ve never even seen her smile like that before. Our biggest regret is not removing her teeth sooner because it was a huge difference in our dogs happiness and health. Her breath didn’t stink anymore!! One thing is that now her tongue hangs out uncontrollably. You have to poke it here and there so she can put it back in her mouth and it doesn’t get too dry. You still have to be careful about the food you give your chihi. They need soft food with low to no sugar so it doesn’t make their gums rot. The brand we like to give her is the Weruva Dog In The Kitchen soft dog food packets. It makes her so happy and excited to eat for once. I’m glad you’re a responsible dog owner and I’m really glad you did this. Hopefully you’ll see different signs in Marbles happiness.
God I love you guys. Hope both you and Mr. Marbles are feeling good in the new year <3
honestly one of my favorite videos! Love marbles ❤️
You take care of that sweet angel, girl, we'll see you and the rest of the fam next year~
Don’t feel bad! You’re such a great mama! ❤️
We don’t mind Jenna! We love you and Marbles and want you to focus on caring for him. Don’t worry about us . Also that sound Kermit made 😂😂
stop apologizing you've been on the youtube grind for about 10 years consistently. Keep on being amazing and heal the pups!
I MISS THE SQUEAKY INTRO OMFG
It's been a hectic week for me, so I wasnt able to sit down on my computer before now. I just wanted to say that I am glad Mr. Marbles is healing well and feeling better! I also wanted to say, as many has already, that your fans understands and respects you and what you need to do. So if you cant post a video, you dont need to feel guilty. You have real life happening, and that is something that needs to be dealt with. We all appreciate you so much, so whenever you have other things to deal with - we understand. 

Also, I'm very sorry for you loss. Sending love and condolences.
I’ve watched marbles grow up. Awhhh love you old man
110% understandable. You're a good mommy.
It’s okayyyy marbles>us 100%
So what if I'm the Mooonssterr
I love Little Mr. marbles❣️❣️
aww..poor marbles. I'm happy he will feel better though
Jenna, just know... if needed... I WILL fly to LA to be Marbles’ personal assistant and pre-chew ALL of his food for EVERY meal. Thank you.
Such good dog parents 💕 hope marbles feels better
Videos I watch at 2-3 am
Beeeech, how you gonna chew gum while talking about a toothless Mr. Marbles?!
9 yr olds of the internet:
He's not no dragon
Cermit low key wants his teeth removed just for attention
kept coming to your channel for another new video but realized that you said you were going to take a x mas break! Love you Jenna, have a very merry Christmas <3
Ive known Jenna has been around for a long while on this platform but I never really got in to her videos in the past.

I was recommended her Bob Ross painting video and found that I loved her sense of humor. Suddenly, I was binging too many of her videos from the last couple of years xD

I'm super glad I'm watching now and I just wanted to say that I appreciate both Jenna and Julian being consistently genuine, enjoyable people when it's becoming more and more rare to find here on YouTube. I'm glad you have the opportunity to take breaks for real life now and again and hope you enjoy the quiet any time you can. You guys are awesome
Sending love to Marbles! <3
Jenna, thank you for updating us on Marbles' health, and DO NOT feel bad ever about taking time off for family, pets, and holidays. Your channel is a blessing, and I hope Marbles makes a full recovery soon!
love you jenna, my fave youtuber since I was 12. hope it gets better babe
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️DONT FEEL BAD !!!!!!!😢 hope things are r okay
Jenna, we love you and Marbles sooo much
You don't need to apologize
I wish Marbles a speedy recovery
Hope he will be OK ❤

P.S.: I'm sorry for my bad english, I just want to support you
Love you Jenna, hope Mr. Marbles feels better soon. I'm so sorry about your friend, too <3 lots of love and prayers to you guys
Marbles: has literally no teeth and doesn't cry, is just slightly upset and disgruntled
Kermit: completely fine with teeth and cRiEsSsSs
Hope he feels better! Sending love and snuggles! 💜💜
Pour hid food in his bowl and pour boiling water from the kettle in it then wait for about 10 mins and mush it up , it will be Ester for him to eat plus it will be moist x we o this for my puppy’s when they don’t have teeth yet x
I hope you're all ok. For the next video you could dye your hair!! Love from Argentina ❤️
He needs denchers now lol 😂
Jenna: I appreciate you—
Kermit: unearthly screech
Jenna: oh, for the love of god
Poor beebee Marbles. My mom's dog is around the same age and almost completely toothless as well. I hope he's recovering okay! ❤️
Get well soon mr marbles! Love you!
Love you Marbles! 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Jenna don't worry about it, Mr. Marbles is aaalways first. I really hope he's doing well
Looks like Grandpa Marbles is getting dentures for Christmas
Rest peacefully, Mac.
I love u mr marbles!!!💖
A dentist ad came up when I clicked on this video 😐
I low key thought marbles was like 18 years old
Don’t ever apologize for taking care of marbles or for spending time with your family. ❤️

Poor marbles he's so sweet. I named my dog after marbles! Love him
I hope Mr. Marbles is feeling better! 
Live like your sim for 24 hours challenge? :)
Praying for a fast recovery
jenna: why are you crying
cermet: am emoshunal
Is it just me or do I hear crickets in the background 😂
Poor Marbles! I wonder if he’ll be one of those Chihuahuas that can’t keep his tongue in. That will be so adorable.
Poor marbles. Wishing him a speedy recovery.
coddammit cearmit always steeling spotlight from mr. marbles
JENNA DONT FEEL BAD !!! Your dogs are your family, and we completely understand !!! Sending love and best wishes to Marbles and that he has a quick recovery !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rest In Peace marbles 12-29-18
Just make a 60 minute video you you and marbles napping.  or Not  Puppy first.
OMGGGGG IM DEADDDDDDDD A DENTAL AND TOOTH AD CAME RIGHT BEFORE THIS LMAOO IT SAID DO YOU NEED DENTURES?? MR MARBLES DOES
How to train your chihuahua 
Dont tell me know one else thought of how to train your dragon
Reading the description is an important part of this video. I'm dearly sorry to hear about Mac. Thank you for caring for Marbles, our favorite lil chihuahua on the Internet. I'm praying for Mac's family.
From one toothless wonder to another, you got this marbles!
Lucky u!! Marbles, we love you so much
Holy shit I haven’t watched you in probably 6 years and this still made me so sad the connection you have with your dog is so strong. Stay positive and all will be well!
I've always liked your shorter real life type videos that were spontaneous anyway. I know you make more for more view time, but the shorter ones are my faves. Happy Holidays
Video Idea: I hire a pet communicator / psychic to find out why Kermit is crying all. the. time.
Be there and love your dog, and don’t feel bad. Feel good about the fact that Marbles is loved and cared for. 

Kermit’s just here like “oh is today a cuddle day for everyone?”
I hope marbles feels better and is doing well! Have a wonderful Christmas and new year! Hope the old man gets better soon! He's such a cool fixture in all your videos! Love to all your fam!
his food practically has to be sopping oatmeal consistency now. good luck marble. #marblerecovers
I wish more people were assertive about this stuff like you. Too many give their all to work, and have nothing left for what really matters. So glad you're there for your wonderful companion.
Wishing Marbles a super fast recovery!
How long does it usually take you to film and edit your video each week?
Rip Marbles 💀
Awh. She's so upset and flustered.
Don't fuss Jenna. Do some snuggles and unwind <3
Sending all the love to marble and to you as well, we understand so much!!! Be with him!!!
You don't need to apologize. Family and dog family come first. I hope Marbles gets better soon. And I'm really sorry about your friend.
Sending many well wishes to you guys! Have a relaxing holiday season, Jenna!
We love you Marbles <3 get well soon little buddy
When you come back you should do a Bob Ross painting on your face  because you're the best beautuber ever.
My dog recently got his teeth removed and I was really upset about it and honestly this video made me feel so much better wow I'm really glad I stumbled across it.
Hi Jenna, 1.  You shouldn't have to apologize for looking after family first, he is your little boy that's been there for you through thick and thin, as long as I have followed he has been there. 2. You are both amazing people and should not feel bad about making Family first, we love you and hope you had a great day with Marbles and it made you feel awesome to be able to be there for him too. You both deserved the time together. Also I'm so sorry about Mac, Sending much love and light to you all from Sydney, Australia
Much love to you, marbles and your family. We'll always be waiting for your return!
Awah Marbles...oh Jenna and Julian hope Marbles recovers I liked this video yes!!!! :) <3
Also, can someone please let me know where that blanket is from? It looks amazing
jenna!!! you don't ever need to apologize or feel bad for taking time off, period. especially for spending time with your furballs and loved ones. we all 100% understand, always!! i'm glad the procedure went okay and i hope he feels much better quickly. sending him lots of love and smoochies! and i hope you have a wonderful time with your family!! <3
Anyone else get a ad for Missing teeth at the top of the the videos on the side of the screen? Cause I did XD
From one toothless chihuahua momma to another, you taking care of that sweet little bean just makes me love you more. Get well soon, Marbles!
Kermit is jelly 😭 😂 he’s sooo cute
I love this. This is so pure. I love you and everything you are❤️ feel better meebles❤️❤️❤️ also my brain went “you should’ve litter trained him” at one point in this video so thought I’d add that 
Ps I miss ad
I hope Marbles recovers quickly he is the goodest boy.
Wish you and Marbles lots of love
the add before the video said “best mom ever” and I was like “yes jenna is”
this video is something i didn’t know i wanted until i watched it even if it’s so simple

it’s just like so real and makes me feel better about people on social media
This is just a joke so please don’t take this serious 🚫❗️
But my Chow Chow mix is 17 years old and she acts more alive then Mr.Marble😂💀💀
That's the difference between Jenna and other YouTubers. She apologizes for such simplistic things, and I love it.
OMG MarBLES AND JENNA ARE 32 years old or so wiki tells me
Oh, god love him he is such a sweetheart. I have a little chihuahua as well. You take your time caring for him, have a merry Christmas and a happy new year!
I'm sending him all the love ♡♡♡ what a good pup
Poor pupper 😢 he is a good boy!!! He just looks out of it!!!! Give him lots of love, cuddles, kisses & pets from us!!!
This is so on brand for Marbles

Edit: Since this has likes and she might read this, I just want to say Jenna, hang in there, you’re doing the best anyone could in this situation, and we all love you for being such a good mama to marbles, cermet, and paesh. I’m so sorry this has been such a hard week. Sending you love and light 💕🐓💜
Aww I remember when you got him,9 years ago!Aww!
My baby, Geezer, always looked a little like Marbles. She went though a lot of the same things Marbles has went through. I loved her most when she was a senior. Love Marbles every moment you can! Good luck Meebles!
Actually think Kermit was feeling sad for marbles he looks worried about him
He's amazing bless him x
Good fans would not get mad at you for this! Family comes first, hope marbles eats and heals quick!
No apologies needed Jenna. Please take care of yourself during this difficult time. Marbles little face just broke my heart 💔.
Awe poor chihuahua 😍😖 I’m a chihuahua lover myself but I hope he gets better 💙
I can’t believe that mr marbles is an adult dog. To me he is a smol beany babyy
Marbles can go as Toothless, the dragon for Halloween :D That would be adorable <3 (as long as he is cool with the costume, of course).
next video: we got marbles dentures
best wishes to Marbles and to you!
You're absolutely great, Jenna!
You have nothing to feel bad about except the absence of Marbles' teeth))
You're a good doggy mom.🐾💕 Have fun with your family! You deserve a break, honey!
Don't you dare feel bad! You go girl. I hope he feels better! We aren't going anywhere! 😘

Sending love to Marbles. Kermit at the end lmao
Awww Marbles you are alive haaha
Do NOT apologize! Marbles is an oldie but goodie and he deserves all your love and attention and you deserve all the time you need. When you said Marbles has been there for you for 10 years I started crying. How lucky we are to have dogs who are better humans than humans. Oh God here come the waterworks again!😣😢
Poor Marbles! I hope he's doing better <3
I love how apologetic and genuine Jenna has always been. She's for sure one of the best creators and people on youtube!!!!
Funny, my friend had her dachshund’s teeth pulled. Mocha, the dog, is only four but had half her teeth pulled. I hope Marbles gets better.
Feel better Marbles. Jenna you're awesome for taking such good care of Marbles.
I would like to take a moment to appreciate Jenna for being who she has always been. If you read the description she just lost a dear friend to cancer, and while many people in the platform would absolutely milk that for views she just mentions it for transparency reasons, in a very tasteful way. We love you, we appreciate you, and it's more than ok that you made no video because you wanted to take care of Marbles; it's what we expect from you
Marbles is basically a frog now
STOP apologising, i hope meebles is ok x
This gave me idea. Got mr marbles toothless costume pls
Awww, don't feel bad, Jenna, we all love Marbles. Take care of your baby and enjoy your holidays!
Give Marbles the attention not us we'll be fine




tfw you get more than one like
Feel better soon, Marbles. <3
It breaks my heart... It is so sad to watch our babies grow old. A big hugh to you guys, and a bigger one to baby Marbles❤️
Get well soon, Mr. Marbles!
Love you guys and the babies. Marbles will be fine. It’s a lot! All the best for 2019
Mr Marbles health and well being is a million times more important than us being entertained.
January 9th is the day before my birthday
I feel for marbles, I got my wisdom teeth taken out yesterday.
Next video should be you making Marbles a pair of doggie dentures so Kermit isn't so sad about having teeth
A dental ad played before this😂
He's officially a grandpa now where are those diapers
Marbles is so cute when he’s cuddled up like that with you Jenna...❤️❤️❤️
this happened to my pupper :((
You are an amazing pet momma! Hope marbles is feeling better
Jenna, there is no need to apologize. Take time to grieve your friend and take care of Mr. Marbles. It's okay and healthy. You are doing incredibly--we all understand and appreciate you.
You do not have to apologize for missing a video. it is not important, it is much more important to know that marbles are in order
Aww Marbles, hope he feels better soon 💕
I hope marbles is doing well you are a good mom to that little angel 🖤
I got a dental ad before this I’m SCREAMING.
"...Marbles has been there for me for 10 years, for everything I've even gone through..." I suddenly felt so connected and understood and... Thank you SO MUCH, Jenna. I have a ten years old pet who's been sick for while with a sad diagnosis, and I've been petting him and holding while watching your video, and I no longer feel like a weirdo who cares for pets the way we do. 
I wish Marbles to get well soon, and to just be the awesome little man that he is for another 10 years to come! x
I love marble so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg I lost it when she said marbles has been here for 10 years so I'ma be here for him Jenna truly loves her animals it's so heart warming
I hope Marble gets to feeling better soon. Take care of the little man. Hope you are okay too. I know he is your baby, so stressful for you too. Take Luck, Good Care.
He is also squeak toy intro less too.
It's not a Jenna Marbles video without cermit crying
Don't feel bad, marbles needs you. And you deserve a holiday break so dont feel bad we all understand and we love you ❤
Поправляйся ,маленький старичок Марблс !❤
family comes first!!!
Before the video, I got a dentist ad....
You should show him the movie “How to Train Your Dragon” so that he can see that even big strong dragons can be toothless too. Feel better Marbles and don’t feel bad for taking care of your family, Jenna!
My Chihuahua/min pin mix had a lot of teeth pulled and he was off for a couple of weeks. Once he healed he was just fine. Give him some chicken soup broth.
Sorry about Mac and sorry about Marbles, it's tough. It's hard to see your dog's visibly age and to lose a dear friend on top of it.
Is the break also going for Julien? I hope you both get to enjoy your breaK!
The dogs always need to come first. That’s how it is in my home. Happy Holidays!
At this point i have to say my dog watches these videos with me. between the squeaky toy in the intro and the noises that kermit makes, she always reacts when I'm watching lol
Awe my heart plz feel better soon Marbles! Me and my puppies are sending lots of love your way❤️
We understand! Lol just like julien pretending to be us said 😂 luuuvvvv yalllll
Kermit: Hold my kibble
Don’t worry about it Jenna. Taking care of Marbles is the most important thing you could be doing. We love and support you ❤️
I have a cat with one tooth and it 's not a big deal once their palate heals. She eats small kibble (vet approved) and she is a happy girl.
Don’t u dare feel bad about this ok u are an amazing mom marbles is so lucky
Do a soap cutting video 👏🏻👏🏻
Don't worry: we get, old man dog needs you more than us
My dog went through the same thing last year! Hes 10 too, but he's SO much happier now that his mouth pains are gone! 
Tips 
-For feeding, I had to spoon feed my dog canned food after his surgery for two days. He didnt want to drink anything but the canned food has water in it so he was fine. Now I chop up some canned food and sprinkle a little bit of hard food on top and then put some hot water in it for him. He eats well and moved on from plush toys to rubber duckies. He LOVES his rubber duckies. 
-  There are also these little treats called "softies". They come in bite size pieces. Thats the only treat I give him now. Most other stuff he tries to swallow and ends up throwing it up. But those one, he can "chew" them with his gums.
Awww poor baby, take all the time you need ♡
Healing boops for mr marbles ❤️ sorry for the loss of your friend
Technically, this is still a video.
Poor Marbles! I had a chihuahua mix that also ended up toothless when she was around that age. Hope you have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, Jenna! ❤️
You should just take the rest of the year off. It sounds like you have a lot going on. Or just do a bloopers video. Self care is so important and we love you! You've been in this game a long time. We will be here in January
Now he’s a dragon but a still best of wishes to him
you should make/get a toothless the dragon costume for marbles next halloween
my pup elka just had surgery yesterday. now I'm playing dr mama for hers lol. I feel so bad but she needed the mass removed and now all the love and treats in the world are hers
Kermits an emotional guy!
Poor Mr. Marbles. He is still so cute.
I have a 12 yo chihuahua. She is lucky and still has all her teeth. I do agree toothlessness can only add to the infinite amount of charm Marbles already has. I have to remind myself of this very often and it still hasn’t fully stuck that we all need to stop feeling guilty for taking care of what’s most important to us. You have 100+ other videos I can/will/do rewatch. Your legit my go to when I need a good laugh so thank you!! All the✌️&❤️!!!
Of course they had to remove Marbles teeth, you cant have a corpse with teeth crawling around
Of course we understand guys!  It makes me so sad to see you stressing about this.  🥺
My chihuahua x went through this earlier this year, and it really took it out of her too. It definitely put me into panicked furmum mode. But it has made her feel so much better and she is still gobbling absolutely everything she can. It just means she struggles to grip her food, so sometimes she is a bit like a hungry hippo bouncing her food around. She now also has a very dorky tongue slippage, which I am sure Marbles has that to look forward to. Sending you both love <3

Poor baby!  Your dog and family really are more important - don't feel bad <3
Can you please do another version of the "we bought clothes for each other" video because it was so funny
This is why you're my FAVORITE youtuber. Don't apologize. You're wonderful.
Dont feel guilty !! Take care of your fur baby ❤️

Poor marbles. I been around since your first video.
Aww I hope marbles feels better ❤️
Kermit was so jealous 😂😂😂
“ marbles has been there for me for 10 years for everything that I’ve ever gone through, so it felt like the right thing to do today to be there for him”... why am i crying rn
Jenna is our new Bob Ross. His life was dictated by freedom, tranquility and being so damn wholesome, and so is Jenna’s. Jenna has the freedom to do whatever she wants, entertain others and make so many people happy. 

<3
Kermit crying at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We love you so much!!!😘😘😘😘 we understand!!!!
The dogs come first!!!!! Give Marbles the attention, not us!!!!
We love you Marbles. I hope you’re feeling better.
Go Jenna for being the best dog mom ever💕
FEEL BETTER MARBLES THE SENIOR!🌸🐒
Can Marbles have the nickname Gummy please?
You just entered into a new level of adulting, Marble’s mom...staying home from work with a sick child. I’m sorry you lost your teeth Marbles, and hopefully you will have no more pain in your mouth, little one.💕
Don’t be jealous!! Marbles needs you !!
Toothless from how to train your dragon?
TODAY IS JAUNARY ( OMG I HAVE BEEN WAITING
Are you still doing extras and bloopers for this year?
He still the goodest boy
Poor marbles 😩he looks adorable in ur arms tho😩❤️
still love mr. marbles❤️
Do diy hair dazzles for next vid!!
Dogs getting old is so heartbreaking. The two in my pic are 12 and 11 right now. They are almost toothless as well. Poor Marbles, but at least, he is loved, cared for and adored, in the end, that's all we could ever wish for especially for them.
Marbles is officially an old man
Aw babe !!! I hope marbles is feeling better
Much much love to all of you <3
A dog with no teeth?   The spirit has left his body.
Will to live has left the chat:
Baby food can now come in handy ❤️ but poor marbles 😢❤️
Marble is such a good dog, I hope he is feeling better and that you have a wounderful Christmas and New Years! You put out so much grear content that you deserve some good time off, enjoy yourself!
0:21 .... Jenna: yesterday...
Jackfilms: I asked you...
My condolences for the loss of your friend, Mac Declue.  I hope little Mr. Marbles is feeling better.   No apologies needed for taking care of yourself and your family, whether human or furbaby.
Cermet and Marbles face is just too cute to handle
Fun little fact. Chihuahuas can live up to a maximum of 20 years. Jenna. Mr. Marbles is barely at his halfpoint :)
you don't need to apologize jenna unlike SOMEONE we don't make everything about ourselves
I love how she just makes videos like this!!! I hope Marbles feels better!
I love you so much Jenna. Your whole family ♥️ thank you for being open and honest and authentic. I’m praying for your family during this time ❤️
Get well as soon as possible!🐾💜
I love you marbles feel better !!!
Just as a tip from someone who's dog has had lots of dental work
Frozen chicken broth is great because it's easy for them to eat and the cold helps with their gum pain
insert toothless dragon picture on marbles face
i legit cried reading the description. ily jenna
英語のリスニングの練習目的でいつも見てます

I didn't even know about Mac, and his relation to Mr.Marbles :(
Can you just cake your face in makeup, like drag cake face, and place it on multiple white pillows for some good throw pillows around your house
Peach in the background subtly trying to get attention 😂😂
Get well soon Mr Marbles ❤️❤️❤️
Awww  happy he is okay. Hope he feels better
I can’t imagine s better video than Jenna taking care of toothless Marbles.❤️❤️❤️❤️
FEEL BETTER MARBLES!!
Jenna.. you do you girl. Marbles is in good care and I hope he recovers quickly. Have an awesome holiday!
Все будет хорошо, марблс держись пупочка(
Found this channel because of a comment on a vid from junskitchen
Kermit knows that Marbles doesn’t feel well
Please respond to Jon 2018
I just got a dentist ad before this oh LORD
i love you mr marbles
Aw, don't worry Jenna. We can all still binge watch your old videos, and Juliens. I think we can survive a few weeks.
hi my name is trey and I'm going toothless tomorrow
hey, all okay, we are all understand) he's needs your love now
We love you jenna!! You deserve some time off <3 rest as much as you need to. We'll all be here when you're back 💚
You are the only thing that brings me joy right now
Stop apologising gurl
I remember when I first came across your video, had to be 6 to 7 years ago and I’ve only watch a few at the time. I lost base with you and I randomly think about one of your vids and come back to see that you have 18M followers now. Sheesh! Lol ... seriously though. I’m happy for you. This is what you wanted to do and you’re doing it. Stay Blessed Jenna.
Don't ever feel bad for doing something you feel you need to do. We have hundreds of videos from you we can watch, I'm sure we can all manage a week or two without a new video.

And as someone who volunteers weekly (sometimes several days a week), I can assure that toothless animals are, in fact, hilarious. One cat, named Gina, feels the need to chew and gum on the fingers of anyone who pets her. It's great. And knowing how goofy Marbles is, it'll only make him even more endearing and lovable.
So he's basically a dragon.
now all the more reason to feed him raw grass-fed open-range hamburger meat! yay marbles!
Instead of filming a video, have your mom take over the channel for a week and see what happens
It’s the Debbie revolution 
Debolution
I'm deeply sorry for the loss of your dear friend to glioblastoma - my father passed of the same almost 3 years ago and I, unfortunately, understand the devastation of this particular cancer. Sending positive thoughts to you during this difficult time and wishing a speedy recovery to Mr. Marbles ❤️
Don't feel bad, you silly person. You are ridiculously sweet and kind. Take care!!!! <3 We love you.
next on julien’s channel “we found kermit’s teeth on the floor”
I thought to myself its 3 days after she posted this wtf why haven't i watched this video yet
Next Halloween can you dress him up as toothless from how to train your dragon? pleeeeaaaase!


Edit: Ive just read the description, im so sorry for your loss Jenna. Stay strong.
KERMIT IS ME. But you're truly the best dog mom, Jenna. i hope Marbles has a speedy recovery, it sucks seeing him in pain and so worn out ❤️
I love you and your vids. My girlfriend and I always talk about your vids and we watch them together and laugh a lot. We booth love you so much and I hope that Marbles feels better. I love your dogs so much that I want my own grey hounds and Chihuahua. Love you Jenna and Julien, Thanks for the funny videos and just being a good person.
My chihuahua is toothless and she does just fine. They adapt well with soft food
Dear Jenna,
First I would like to say I hope Mr. Marbles feels better soon ❤. He needs all ur love and attention. Second, in spirit of the holidays you should treat your self to a beautiful Grinch who-ville inspired hair do. Love, Cindy
Marble =
Looks 2 years old
Actually 10 years old
But acts
169 years old
I feel a kinship with Mr. Marbles cause I'm in the hospital. I'm feeling better but I got a day or two left before they let me go home. Just seeing you Jenna and Marbles was enough for me and had made my day better.
get well soon mr. Marbles!
we with you and marbleth a merry chrithmath
Girl take all.tbe days at least you informed us
Cermet jealous that his teeth weren't taken out.
Why us marbles getting even cuter  every day
I got an ad for dental implants before this
I hope Marbles feels better. Does he need to eat like soft food from now on since he’s toothless???  Make sure he does eat and drink and make sure to contact the vet/dentist to see if it’s normal if he’s not eating.

I’m just concerned about the small doggo. I mean no offense, if offense is even taken???

Much love and concern. ❤️❤️❤️
;-; marblesssss
I swear, Jenna is one of the sweetest people on the internet.
I’m so happy I got a baby and now have 2 month of vids to catch up on 😍😍
Kermit lives a pretty pampered life and yet he still chooses to cry
My little girl had her teeth pulled out and we just switched her to wet food. I called her gums McGee. He is a trooper.
gets dental ad heh... 420 blazin.
Wow it’s actually really refreshing to see a youtuber who doesn’t think their fans are gonna hate them if they take a break. Good for you Jenna
I’m going to be devastated when marble passes
I'm probably one of like  ten people that likes Marbles the most.  I hope he feels better soon.
Can we get Marbles in a Toothless outfit, please??
We love you guys and we completely understand! Heal fast marbles!
Mr. Marbles being healthy, happy, and well is a billion times better any video. Thank you for taking such amazing care for him 🧡 get better bebop boy
So sorry for the loss of your friend Mac.   I have a chichi too and 💕 mine so much.  He is curled up in my lap now (where else?). lol. Also, the minute you said a toothless dog was funny, I immediately thought of the commercial with the dogs wearing dentures.   I 🤔 think you could make some really cool doggy dentures......hmmm.  Just sayin’....
Aww mister Marbles. Don't feel at all bad, there are times in our lives when we have to hit the pause button and slow down and be present. 💗 Soak up that time with your furbabies, it goes too fast. We just said goodbye to my 17 year old cat and my 10 year old Weimaraner within a month of each other and I don't regret any of the time spent with them before they crossed that rainbow bridge, even if it meant putting some other stuff on hold. I look forward to your video next week and wishing you and your family Happy Holidays! 💗
Mr. Marbles is my G
This Is completely unrelated but can we dress Kermit up as a bar of soap
You should do a video making treats that the sweet toothless marbles can eat



[Edit] Omg that's alotta likes😂
We hope Marbles will be great)
Life happens. Lots of love mister Marbles, please drink some water and get lots of rest.
My friend just had her teacup yorkies teeth removed. It also helped with his breath... he is really old too!
just read the description and i'm sorry for your loss:'(
there is nothing more punk rock or hardcore than taking care of your pets
Your love and affection for your animals is genuine and lovely to see
Can you get a bunch of friends together to play Murder Mystery. One person's the Murderer, one's the Cop and the rest are witnesses. you can use pillows to stun and nerf guns as the cop's weapon and whatever as the murderer's weapon.
marbles is 10 years old but considenring chiwawas(or how ever you spell that) have a lifespan of about 20 years he is very much not a senior
Good for you beautiful take care of your babies and yourself ❤️😉
You dont have to apologize. Your being a good dogo mommy!

Edit: that's a lot of likes. Thank you! Jenna shouldn't apologize for taking care of her puppies. (I dont think they'd survive without her)
did anyone else click on this thinking it was gonna be Marbles dressed up at Toothless or was it just me
I just lost my 18 year old chihuahua last month and I still have a 17 year old chihuahua, hopefully Marbles has many more years to come!!
To the 809 people who disliked this video,  you are heartless
Dont feel bad for taking care of family. Videos can wait. 😁 Others can be patient enougj if not bye beach!
Marbles can now play Toothless in a live action version of How To Train Your Dragon
I thought this was going to be a video where Jenna turned Marbles into Toothless from How To Train Your Dragon. Now I really want to see that.
Honestly this made me tear up. I feel bad for marbles that he had to go through all this nonsense. It's even harder that we cant talk to animals to know for sure if they're okay or not. :( and also prob doesnt help that my dog just had surgery probs too and she was/is pain for recover Just kinda emotional right now.
PLEASE pierce Julien's ears next week. That would be the funniest thing in the entire world. Give your man the ears he deserves. 


Like if you want to see this too so Jenna will see!!!
P.s. Hope you are doing well Jenna. I'm not at all religious but all of my thoughts and prayers go to you and you friends and family. You change so many lives and We genuinely love you so much. Thank you for everything you do.
Jenna, I am more sorry for the loss of your beloved friend Mac than there are words to convey. My heart goes out to you and all his friends and family members. All I can say is that he lives on in all his loved ones, and always will.

Huge hugs to you and a gentle cuddle for Marbles.
They did surgery on a chihuahua.
Have nice Christmas to You and Julian  and a lots of cuddles to Marbles and Cermet and Paesh 😍😍❤❤🎅
Doggy dentures time
It's crazy that you feel the need to apologize for taking care of your dog and recovering from losing a friend! Be cool, internet. Let creators take the time they need to be human or we'll end up in a world of Logan Pauls. 

We love you, Jenna & Marbles! Enjoy your well-deserved break. We'll be here.
Those 270 dislikes are just Kermit's accounts whining because this video isn't about him.
Pitiable Marbles! Jenna, he really needs you now, so be with him, support him!
I think Marbles is either traumatized or sad that he doesn’t have any teeth.
Happy healing Marbles!
Everyone read the discription. Jenna probably spent over 20 minutes writing it.
We are not important... well.... not like MARBLE!  I hope the little guys is feeling well soon!  Poor Marble!
we love u and ur little family jenna. 🖤
never ever feel bad for putting your family (including puppies) first. That is your right as a human. You deserve it. Your fans understand and love you!
Petition to rename him toothless like from how to train ur dragon
To those who have watched this video I suggest you also read the description. Jenna is one of the kindest people I've had the pleasure to watch over these years. She deserves kindness and patience and I ask that you give it to her. The world needs more people like Jenna.
Dead & Toothless, throw it away.... Jk, poor baby marbles, don’t apologize we want the best for you all❤️❤️❤️
I’m watching your old videos. Cause I’m not waiting around for a new vid today/tomorrow. 🤓
anything that would actually be natural would not have to deal with these deformities  but you're a nice mom jenna
Take care of yah babies and yah family, we'll be waiting for your next video whenever it comes. :) Endless love for Marbles and the babies, I hope he starts feeling back to normal as soon as possible.
I don't understand how people could dislike this video. 
Like, a dog mum wanting to take care of her pupper is heartwarming af. 
How can people's hearts be so cold?
I'm so glad you're being a great dog mum!
I got an ad for some dental surgery thing before the video started.
Feel better marbles 💙💙💕
2019 better be the year for people that deserve a raise part 2

Jenna & Julien. Sending sweet little Marbles prayers that he feels better VERY soon. Also sending Mom & Dad (you guys) Prayers as I’m sure it’s been incredibly stressful & difficult. Family ALWAYS comes first. Blessings & Love to all of you. ❤️🙏🏻🐾
Take care of yourself and your puppies! Love you, have a relaxing break!
For those of us that have dog children and have also been watching you and marbles for the majority of your YouTube career, we understand Jenna! Family first then work! Enjoy your time off! Merry Christmas! Happy New Year! Get well soon Marbles! ❤️
I wonder if her basketball game ever happened...

Jenna deserves to rest. Physically and emotionally. As well as Julien. Good luck to you both! I hope you get the support you deserve.
omg i love your dogs so much
3:57 I freaking died of laughter
my pupper had to get all but two of her teeth removed and she’s still the strongest of all my dogs. she always wins all of the tug of wars and stuff like like. so marbles will be just fine 🤪
Yay January 9th is my birthday
(read the description everyone!) I'm sorry for your loss!
We love you Jenna and Marbles don’t feel bad, take as much time as you need ❤️
Why does Julien always breathe so mf loud
My moms a Virgo and animals LOVE her and she just has this motherly connection to them. Virgos are truly down to earth people
poor old man marbles ❤️❤️ speedy recovery!
I normally don’t comment on videos - but I need to say it. You are a phenomenal human being. You are so genuinely you. I feel so bad that you need to apologize for real life - because that’s what makes you so relatable. I start my Thursday’s off with Jenna and coffee, and you are just so refreshing. Please don’t ever change who you are, the content you create and never apologize for you being you. Thank you. Condolences on the loss of your friend. It’s tough. All the best xo 

Oh - I wish gummy-sue the speediest of recoveries.
Hi, Jenna!  

This video really hit me hard because my puppy mill rescue chihuahua (Beans) needs pretty extensive dental care and a hernia repair.  Last year, the vet I was referred to would not do the hernia repair because of her heart murmur. 

As of today, her teeth are hurting her and it's a bit of a risk, but I am trying to find a place that will take care of her teeth and her hernia at the same time, to reduce the risk of complications, and to improve her quality of life.  I know she's got many years left in her and he is otherwise the happiest, strongest chi I know.  My veterinarian's name is the same as mine too!!

I'm also very sorry to hear about your friend.  Sending you all the love and rest this holiday season.  <3
You’re such a good mommy. Speedy recovery x
the way you take care of ur babies <3 great mom
I hope baby marbles is making a good recovery ❤️
No, Jenna! Marbles is top priority. Film video some other time. Give him lots of cuddles and kisses. GO!
It doesn't matter what videos you make, we still love them and you
Will there be an Extras and Outtakes video at the end of this year?  I love those.
We had to do this with our cat in his senior years. He was depressed for a little while after, but he eventually started eating and drinking again. Just needed lots of love. Happy healing, Marbles!
Hi Jenna, I know you probably won't see this, but I found out today that my cat has to get most of his teeth pulled and I've been absolutely heartbroken about it. This gave me hope! I know Marbles is going to be okay and so is my sweet, old kitty. The things we do for our pets ❤️
So sorry for your loss, Jenna... (read the description, guys). We wish Marbles a speedy recovery. You are such a caring person! Please, take all the time you need. Your true supporters will always understand.
I got a dental implant ad before the video
I’m waiting for your next hair dying video 😭
THOSE FOR WHO DIDNT READ IT

Again I apologize that this was not the video I had planned on making today and Marbles is doing really well, it just felt like the right thing to do to look after him as closely as I could today and yesterday after his surgery.  Here are some answers to some questions that I know people will ask in the comments: 

Mr. Marbles is a 10 year old senior chihuahua who weighs around 4.3 pounds.  It is very common in not only chihuahuas but of many toy dog breeds to have dental issues, this is due to their teeth being very small, crowed in their mouth, and when food particles get stuck in there it can lead to tartar, plaque, gingivitis, periodontal disease, all kinds of complications in their mouths just like humans.  It can also  vary in severity from dog to dog, some might have many teeth at an advanced age and some start needing dental work at 1 or 2 years old.  I tried for many years to take as many preventative steps as possible like cleaning his teeth with a small brush and with wipes, making sure he has things to chew to keep his gums and teeth clean, but it was sort of just inevitable at some point.  He has had many operations to remove teeth to keep any dental diseases from progressing and keep his mouth healthy.  The reason we needed to see a specialist (and shout out to the woman that did his procedure her name is also Jenna and she was just best ever) is because unlike larger dogs (or people) small dogs' teeth are so little and delicate in the back that in some instances their jaw can actually break during these procedures.  So as you can imagine, along with having some pretty awful levels of discomfort (he was doing a lot of sniffling as well because it was bothering his nose) this was kind of an intense procedure for him and the recovery has been pretty different than the other times when he's just had some teeth pulled.  I'm very happy though that we were able to get these last teeth out for him before things progressed any further in his mouth that would only lead to more problems for him so my guy is toothless.  Thanks for understanding that this has been a little bit of a different week.  

I also just out of pure transparency wanted to tell those of you who so kindly and generously donated to my friend Mac Declue's gofundme 4 years ago, he was my roommate when I lived in Boston, a wonderful friend of mine who actually was the one who gave Mr. Marbles his name while we lived together, thank you from the bottom of my heart again for doing that and allowing him to get the absolute best treatment he could and allow his family to be by his side.  His battle with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer, ended this past Sunday and he is finally at rest.  It has been a heartbreaking week, I'm sure you can relate as I imagine many of you have lost loved ones to cancer, and it has made taking care of Mr. Marbles, a dog that he named, a whole mix of emotions for me.  Mac was so loved and he will be so missed.   I apologize that this is not something that would usually warrant an entire video but, it's been a lot.  Thank you for your understanding and I'll see you next week.  

Please subscribe to my channel and my vlog channel!  I make new videos here every Wednesday and make vlogs during my majestical daily life.
You look so pretty 😁❤️
You know your dedicated viewers cares about Marbles and all the pet's well-being. I for one would not want you to spend time entertaining us when your dog needs you! I know caring for an ill or injured pet is emotionally draining so please try not to also stress about the people who dislikes this video or generally don't understand. Take care of yourself and each other!<3
omg please make a video of mr marbles eating stuff with his gums like a grandpa
out of respect for marbles my only comment on this video is dear marbles i hope you are feeling better soon love u
Poor sweet little Marbles I just want to cuddle him.
He is gonna be ok!! He just won’t be able to hold his tongue in his mouth
Kermit on the other hand..
No go love on your dog don't feel bad any of us would do the same 💞have a good recovery marbles
My two chihuahuas are also now 10 years old! One of them somehow has perfect teeth and never needed any removed in her whole life, but my other baby had 4 more teeth removed at their recent dental. He's not toothless yet, though! I believe Marbles will pull through <3
mr. marbles speedy recovery!!
Poor baby marbles😢
Love you jenna just take care of yourself. I can imagine what's going through your mind grand ma past away 1 month ago from cancer aswelll may mac rest in peace. Take care and enjoy time with your loved once♥️
Don't feel guilty about taking care of your baby instead of making a video to entertain us. We'll be ok. Marbles is in a pitiful state right now, and he needs you. Also, I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. You may be able to take some comfort in the fact that he is no longer in pain.

My mom's boyfriend passed away a few days ago. All we know is that he had had a seizure a couple of days before he passed. My mom is devastated. For anyone who prays, if you could include my mom and her boyfriend's family in your prayers, we would appreciate that so much. They all need as much as they can get right now. Thank you.
take your time Jenna💖 marble’s need for love and care is much more important than our “need” for content. we love you💖💖
This is one of my favourite videos! My Jack Russell - Magic has been my bestie for 13 years. I love that you love your dogs so much. This was a special day :) <3
I honestly love you so much, I really want to meet you.
That description though. I’m sorry about your friend, Jenna. Marbles lives on in his memory, even toothless!
My chihuahua got all her teeth taken out this last may, she bounced back pretty quick and now shes a little piggy.. I do make her own food... and that could definitely be an option for you to do aswell 😊 my rescue chi is around 10- 12 years.
this was so cute and sad I hope he gets better :(
My aunt adopted a little yorkie that had maybe five teeth left. It was so sad. But he was so adorable and was very loved and well taken care of.
:49 because he is dead
Please read the description..
PEACH DIDNT WANT TO COME UP TO HIM LIKE MARBLES
Awh poor marbles ! Hope he feels better !
Awe my poor me marbles I love him poor guy . I have a small dog too and I’m worried about this
Thought u were gonna dress him up as toothless , as in the dragon from httyd
A mom that we need but not the one we deserve
i have the same red snowflake pillow
Your pupper will feel SOO much better very soon. I have a doggo named Baxter who was very miserable and angry with all his teeth bc he had some type of gum disease, which is common for Bichon Maltese's. The poor thing was suffering until his last tooth was lost in a fight against his younger adopted brother Caesar.

He now plays like a puppy and surprisingly can still eat food. As long as it's in small tiny bits or wet food, he eats.
Awwww marbles hope you feel better
My old dachshund badger had all of his teeth removed as well
It's obvious what Marbles needs, he needs a balloon ride.
Dogs don't really chew their food anyway.  He'll be fine - just give him some canned food from now on
Oh my god the cricket in this video is attackin me with sound
We understand. Take care of your baby and have a Merry Christmas with your family.
Awh your video break is over the time lapse that I have my surgery:( who else will I binge watch while in bed rest
Oh Jenna. I'm so sorry about your friend. My thoughts are with you.
Poor Mr. Marbles
i will give marbles hugs and pets
I feel like Marbles is always begging viewers, with his eyes, to put him out of his misery.
<3
Well now you gotta make him a costume and dress him as Toothless from How To Train Your Dragon
It auto corrected I didn't mean to put applied
You’re such a good dog mom ♥️
Poor Mr Marbles ❤️
What a rough week 💔 prayers for you all
Give mr marbles a hug and a boop on the snoot for me
You and Julien are the best dog parents!!!
You shouldn't feel bad about spending time with your family and taking care of your dog. Priorities first. There was life before YouTube. Enjoy your Holiday and Get Well Soon Marbles!
I love Marbles and I want him to be happy and feel good :'(
My chi-maltese lost all her teeth at 7! It took her 2 days before she wanted to eat again,  she's the happiest, healthiest she's ever been! He will be the best he's ever been!
Don’t feel guilty!! Marbles has been with us from the beginning on this channel and we love him almost as much as you do. He’s a part of our family so we love how much you love him ❤️
Honestly i could watch kermit sitting there being kermit all day long and be entertained.
Marbles is the best I love hem
Can you please turn yourself into the grinch and have Kermit be max
Stop apologising women! Sorry about the loss of your friend. Everyone here would be patient if you needed time, I'm sure. Hope Marbles makes a fast recovery  ♥️
If he is not acting normally (walking around, going potty, drinking) by tomorrow morning (12/14) then please take him to your vet. He should be fully recovered from anesthesia by now so it is a little worrisome if he's not acting right still. He may take longer to eat bc of the dental surgery. The other thing is it could be that he is painful from surgery (but he should be able to walk and go potty normally). PS. I'm a veterinarian.
He looks so depressed 






Or many he is just dead
YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING GODDESS
last video, play basketball pls
at least he can't hurt children anymore. MR. Marbles is completely all bark and no bite
Don't ever apologize for the weird people who cant handle you being a human without a camera for a couple weeks. I love you both abd praying for Marble and you all to have a great holidays.
Get well marbles. Poor little guy. Happy Holiday's to all of you
Jan 9 is my birthday!!
dental implant ad showed before video lol
Poor marbles, I bet cement is gonna be a jealous rat with you giving marbles so much attention
Omg poor baby
Poor Meebles! Hope he gets to feeling better soon.
You do what you feel is best, Jenna. You’re so incredibly genuine and sweet. Neither Marbles nor your friend Mac will be in pain anymore, which is sad but good for them. Take the time and spend it with your family without feeling bad. You’ve given us a video a week for years now, and that’s more than most of us deserve from you. You’re a good person.
January 9th is my 24th birthday!
Maybe a Bob Ross or soap carving video will make him feel better.
the good news, is that now he can dress up as Toothless for Halloween next year :)
please take care of the marble boy and yourselves <3 <3 we understand
Mr. Marbella ball is dead
I want a Italian greyhound.
Aw Mr.Marbles! My elderly dog is going through something very similar so I feel your struggle. Please do not feel that you have to apologize to your subscribers for taking time off, you’re only human.
Get well Marbles!! 💞💞💞💞💞
Now Kermit and peach gotta stay out of Mr.Marbles soft food , his little mushy fooood
I'm going to set Kermit crying as my ringtone
Please leave us with a bloopers episode!!!
" hey Jenna marbles, my friend Jonathan is really hoping to get your attention. He's trying to do something special for a friend of his and he's sent you details on Instagram and tagged you on twitter hoping together we can get ahold of you and make something special happen for the holidays!"
Kermit is REALLY trying to make every second about him its actually hilarious
Prayers for Marbles recovery!!!🐾 My little guy has been going through the same thing dental wise. It's tuff when our old little babies are hurting. My heart goes out to you Jenna. 💚🐾🐾
Old man marbles 😍
Btw dogs and cats are fully able to eat without teeth even dry kibble. So long as the food is small enough to easily go down his throat he’s fine. We don’t even have to chew our food to a pulp it just has to be able to go down our throat easily
3:01 - awww making me cry
Take care of the Marbles and the Cermets and take care of yourself too Jenna. No true dink fam member will be upset about that
My 11 year old chihuahua went in for a checkup last month and came home with 9 teeth removed. She was super pitiful for a day or two and now she’s doing just fine. I hope Mr. Marbles feels better soon! 😊
It played a dentist ad before the video played :|
Aw Mr.Meebles...feel better!!
Jenna might be known for making silly videos but the love she has for her animals makes me genuinely love her and respect her deeply.
Honestly couldn't pay attention to what Jenna was saying. I was too distracted by Mr. Marbles and his cute little face.
I feel like Kermit is an animal narcissist  😂😂😂
now all he needs is a dragon costume
All love and best wishes to mr.marbels
I honestly think that Cermit was sad about his friend Marbles. HE CRIES FOR A REASON OKAY I LOVE HIM. and stop feeling bad about it Jenna lol its okay. Everyone understands.
“Marbles has been there for me for 10 yrs for everything I’ve ever gone through. So it just felt like the right thing to do, to be there for him.” crying because I’m an emotional potato that loves doggos Wishing Marbles a speedy and smooth recovery, much love. ❤️
Why do you like Greyhounds always look like they're sick and distressed? I'd probably feel guilty only one even though I wasn't doing anything wrong
I know you said marble is fine after his surgery, But i am pretty sure hes dead. :(
It’s sad because I want to turn off notifications so I don’t get a pop up about the passing of good ok’ marbles
Now replace "toothless" of the title with "dead inside"
Poor Mr. Marbles! Hope he feels better soon! Tell Kermit to chill out, lol. Silly pupper!
I got a dentist ad before this video
Proud of you fam!
Not one week
At least he is happy in his mother's arms :)
I have a 15 year old chihuahua. She’s been toothless for a while now. Don’t worry, they love having all the soft foods! Also for treats I suggest dog butter! It’s super dog-friendly peanut butter. Sending Marbles love ♥️
We love you marbles!
When you do come back cuz am having a bad day and it Christmas ......anyway how the hammer do you still have it or going to buys a new one
Family comes first that includes fur babies, ive watched your videos forever and loved watching all the dogs adventures with you guys, i agree %100 that you should and want to be there for him in his toothless journey. Much love, merry Christmas and happy new year! :)
Hide soap around the house and have Cement find them all.
Colleen gave birth, Safiya is engaged, marbles is toothless, simply gave 25,000 to cats. SO MUCH IS GOING ON.
My cat had no teeth at the end of her life! It was really funny too, she would try and eat my big dog's food and just gum at it for hours bc she missed That Cronch ™ She was so full of life after she recovered tho bc of the lack of pain, she was pretty healthy for almost 4 years afterwards. Hope marbles has a gr8 recovery ❤️
Can you try soap carving?
Aww🤧😔
I'm so sorry. My Yorkshire terrier had 10 teeth taken out, and his bites are barely noticeable anymore.
Kermit trying to steal the spotlight again
[Marbles teeth left the chat]
What a sexy who,uwu.
He gets to live on wetfood from now on.  He's gonna live in doggy hog heaven.
Kerm is worried about his brother
You need to dress Marbles up like Toothless from How To Train Your Dragon.
Is marble actually alive? Please say yes.
My chihuahua had all his teeth taken out and his gums have hardened and he eats regular food and is fully healed!
Feel better Marbles
