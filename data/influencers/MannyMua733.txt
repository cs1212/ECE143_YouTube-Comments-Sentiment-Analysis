Please do the Kylieskin review. Can’t buy it if you don’t approve! ❤️🌙
Love you Manny, thank you for actually uploading make-up videos 🥰
"Im texting away because i have a life...its my mom" lmao mee
If you don't like me don't fuking watch you know the drill with THAT... my fav part of your videos lol
So, my momma who is 76, watched you for the very first time today and her thoughts on you as quoted by her "hes kinda of a girly man, but very attractive, and think I might like him" so thoughts of a really girly older woman. You're a hit at our house❤
James Charles Up in flames

MANNY: here’s some kylie eyebrows

edit: wow thanks guys❤️🥰 ps love you manny
Thanks for posting a comparison. Gonna have to check out Kylie's brand
I'm literally sticking to the #1 is benefit brow products!!!!
real talk though.ABH VS Benefit Cosmetics brow products!
When kylie released her kybrow. I was not interested. Cause I have my ABH pomade.
You saying "it is, what it is" is definitely my favorite, I say it on the regular with a manny voice 😂
Normal human: “My spirit animal is a panda”

Me: “My spirit animal is a gay Latino man” 

I just can’t I adore you.

Manny: "Smells like nothing.."

You forgot to try the brow gel 😒😒 but I still love you 😘 ❤️
GayWatch. Love it. You always make me laugh 💗
The GOT reference in the beginning is literally EVERYTHING!
I love Manny sooo much and Stan him but he's staying out of this drama because he was caught in his own a while ago. Some learn to stay out of drama and some dont. Manny learned atleast 🤷
The clickbait was crucial, wording is everything, “exposed” was so enticing
You're literally my favorite youtuber! 💜 I love watching your videos. I've been very depressed lately & your videos really cheer me up. ❤
I'm at dinner watching Manny in the restaurant ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love you Manny!
I could watch Manny Bloopers for the rest of my LIFE BETCH
I will stan Manny till the day I die and that's the tea. Beauty community who?
Your brows look flawless before the products aswell 😫❤️
Hi! I'm from a small island in Azores Portugal, everything is small here but you! I love you with all my heart you make my day ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love it! Love you! Keeping the only drama on the brows like.. 💁🏻‍♂️💕
Should compare it to benefits brow products next
Watching you at the end of my day makes me feel so happy
I was just quoting hot rod yesterday! That exact line 😂
Bahahaha “ya’ll watch it? I hope you do” GOT reference, YAS MANNY 👌🏻
Please upload more often! We love your videos and need more!
Do you have any colourpop eyebrow products? I would like to know how they compare to the kybrow because they look pretty similar.
It was a process but I think i always saw your true colours. I am glad that Gabbie is showing his real face. And I am glad that you survived all that drama in the past. Love you 😘
This video was so pretty and aesthetically pleasing. xx
I see you, great opportunity for Manny to upload a video today, and a beautiful day for it as well 🤗🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️
“Yeah a good 7 years” 😂😂😂
You always make me smile with your videos and I learn things also.  I love getting home from work and having a new video from you to watch!  Love you!
I freakin love you manny.  & I love his personality.. we’d get along great. 😂🖤
I love manny is over here living his best gay life ❤️
Manny pls you need to zoom us in
So excited to see your video notification!!!! I need some Manny!!! Also, I was gettin tired of watchin' James' subs decline 😂🙊
I would’ve loved to see you try and take them off in the bloopers 🤷🏻‍♀️
You’ll always get a like from me even before watching the video. LOVE YOU GORGA
Yeh Kylie’s might be A little cheaper but once you add shipping you should just go with Anastasia at that point
I am waiting for the full kybrow kits to restock! I think this is the most anticipated launch that she has for me! Super super excited to get my hands on it!💕💗💖😍🌸🎀
I wish you and I could have a conversation about game of thrones...love you
I love how manny learned his lesson, and stays out of beauty drama at least, I can still learn from you xox
You look so GOOD in this video!  Skincare routine please!!!!
Manny is the only MUA that genuinely makes me laugh every time I watch one of his videos 💕
The intro giggle was everything 😂💀
Came for Manny, stayed for the bloopers 💁
Hey manny ❤️❤️❤️ I have a question are u going to use kylieskin ? like u can use it for a week and then compare it to your skin routine 😍😍😍😍
Side note... ABH is sold in the NEX on the Navy base. I get my brow wiz for 19 bux. Gotta love a military supporter!
Please make a shirt that says “Aires what Aires” 🤣
All I wanted was mindless makeup fun today so thank you so much! 🥰
Nawww, you're so happy and hyper, thanks for being in touch with the fact that sometimes price is a big factor when choosing products 👏👏👏
P. S. Hope GOT finishes the way you want, you're so cute about your fandom 😘😘😘
You are so funny!!! I love your videos!!! I actually liked the Kylie side on you. ❤❤
Look at Manny thriving and doing his thing minding his business while sipping tea ☕️
I love watching your videos Manny. . I hope you and your family have a great weekend.
Your face at 00:45 asking if we watch GOT just got me 😂😂 I watch it and I’m so mad at it, but let’s move along hahaha
When I have a bad day I come here and you make me laugh my butt off. 😂😂
Do you like me?

No bitchhh we love you! 💜💜
Manny?....was this the day you drank per-workout and sweet tea?.....lol

The new cackle..... I love it 😂😂
Love manny! 🤩 but definitely love Anastasia better
Love your Tshirt!!
Manny you're the best of them all!!
I’m still waiting for a brand other than Ben Nye to have an eyebrow pencil that’s actually for redheads. Not brown, not auburn...something my actual hair color. 

So I’m basically watching your video for entertainment cause you’re the bomb, not because I can take this information and go purchase a product. Lol. 😭
Khaleesi coming out with those dragons 😂😂
I forgot what it was like to watch a non drama video. I've been down the rabbit hole for like 3 days 😂 

Thanks Manny, you brought me back to reality!
When you are actually thankful to be done with all the beauty community.
It felt so good to watch a video about makeup!  Thank you ❤️
I love your videos!❤❤❤ Brows are snatched!!!🥰
Btw does anyone else say “et esss, wat errresss” with manny when he says it? 


No?

Haha yeah no me either... 😳
Hey Manny. I’m just wondering when will you upload a video where you use Indonesian makeup products coz i really want to know your thoughts. 
Anyway, sending loves from Indonesia!
Enjoyed this video! Keep it up manny!
Manny I love you!!😘😘😘
Ever since I heard of brow power I just started using eyeshadow for my brows 😂😂
Great comparison! as always, you delivered
Hi Manny!!  With you on Game of Thrones.

Yup like you 😂
😍😍😍 the Products that you use I love it milk is the best I ever use
Love you mannnyyyy💕💕you’re so wonderful. I feel like the Anastasia when you’re wearing it looks more expensive in a way, like it looks classy
I want a kiley/colourpop comparison.

P.S LOVE YOU MANNY
Your laugh is so contagious! 🤣 Btw maybelline tattoo studio brow pomade is the best, hands down! Better than them all and she's only $9.99! 👐 It does not budge, does not fade, goes on the most even and covers bald patches the best! I used to be an og Anastasia fan until maybelline turned me with their brow pomade! Haven't tried kylie though. 🤔
Starting this new week with some manny ❤️ #blockedbrowbitch lmao
That casual despicable me quote was amazing 😂
I liiiiive for you saying "it is....what it is..." I now say it because i watch you so much..🙄😂
I love game of thrones from one queen to another! 🤗💓
Thank you for a makeup vid! I needed this with all the drama going on... you make me giggle every time and keep doing your blooper reel, because your personality is fabulous ❤❤
I really only started getting in to my brows 2 years ago, thankfully👍🏻❤️ and abh all the way. I still have my soft brown pomade, it lasts for soo long. It’s worth the price because I don’t have to keep purchasing it. 

I stopped purchasing Kylie cosmetics because the products weren’t good for me for the price and this packaging looked really plastic and cheap. Good for my no buy. 

I love this video, thank you manny. 💕
love this💗can you please do a favourites video of the most recent beauty products you’ve been loving? help a chica out😩x
"Es lo que es" :p is a better translation because you are saying "You are what you are"
I love you Manny     I have zero interest in either of these products but I have to support my Manny 🥰
#MANNYAC FAM IS THE BEST FAM

I’m obsessed with manny the only beauty YouTuber I actually like 😍❤️
I'm loving "too much pre-workout" Manny.. let's be real.. I just love some Manny!

So glad you did this. I hate to buy stuff without seeing someone try them first.
I’m currently living for youuu you should do a full face of Walmart, CVS and MAC
Monday’s are better with Manny 💗🌙
Awesome Thank you for Sharing Beautiful
Omg the GOT reference 😂✨😂😩😩😩😩😭😭😭
Slay them brows! You are truly rockin the vids Muffin! Love them both. For me it would depend how many coins were in my purse.
Its a good dupe for sure if you want to save some $coin but i think ill be team Anastasia all the time! Btw love u!!
WE STAN A NON-PROBLEMATIC QUEEN!
Comparison compricing is definitely a thing Manny 😂 I love you so much! Your bloopers always make my day bro for real. "Er is wha er is" 😁
You’re so entertaining and I love your video content! You stay true to original YouTube  and make it about the makeup.
This was sososososo needed. ❤ I want a GOT last episode of the season review GRWM. Like next episode. It would be so funny.
Looove you so much your hilarious 🤣
Yasss 👏🏼 love your videos!
luv the pink background! it goes really well with your blush and lip color. and it makes your hair stands out so much!!!
Gonna try the Kylie thanks for the review!!!
Im from the Philippines and im loving your videos very much <3 loveuuuuu!
This is late, but your base makeup is soooooo flawless!
Love that you posted a video designated to brows! You showed several products & educated me more for sure! Such a good video Manny!! Love you babe 😘
Not gonna lie.....kinda liking the Kylie side more 😳TEA
Thank you sm for this video!! 😍 And Anastasia staying supreme makes sense. It’s just so good.
when mike the situation popped up on screen i lost it
Anyone know if the Kylie products are vegan?
I love you so of course imma watch it
I love you so of course imma watch it
I don't even watch GoT but I get the humor - nicely done haha
thank you for making me laugh!!💜
Cracking me up lol ily 😂💜
Manny, I love you!!!!!! ❤️ you’re the first YouTube beauty/makeup channel I started watching years ago and I’m still addicted!! Ugh
Been loving the end bloopers! 😂💜
i love my kybrow dip brow, my anastasia one got dried out and crumbly and crusty with like a month of owning it and didn’t look good on me but the kybrow is so smooth and amazing i just love ittttt but i agree with you i can do without the highlight stick i’d rather use my shape tape
Nothing wrong with being thick. Hmmm giggle giggle.... . Good job staying out of it. And doing your thang. Love you.
you shoul’ve zoomed in!! anywaysssss great video🥰
I'm so fu%#ing ecstatic that you are doing a makeup video!!!
I I HAVE I BIG CRUSH ON YOU , I GUEES THAT MAKE SENSE COUS BIIIIITCH YOU ARE THE BEST 😎❤❤
I love the kybrow it doesnt dry out as fast as abh. And I feel like the kylie one is smoother to blend and doesnt leave it patchy I love it so much xo
I love you, Manny and you've been using a lot of makeup on your face to look pretty including the Kylie eyebrows!!!
Can you laugh like that everytime? I died Haha so cute!
"no, it's my mom." 💀🤣
You crack me up!! You're so cute. 💜💜💜
"It is what it is" don't forget to roll your Rs kids lol
This is great ! Love you Manny 💜
Battle of the brands? Hmmm Thomas did this first 🧐
I can't belive calisi burned the whole of Kings landing
Thank god someone posted a makeup video!~
We’re getting back to normal, thank you!
Manny you are seriously the funniest person 😂 I always laugh way too hard watching your videos!
You are just so cute. You make me laugh in every video. <3
I absolutely adore you Manny 💜💜💜
Did you end up liking her brushes like I know you love the ABH brow brush?
Everybrand has a promade or pencil.. I just think kylie take over 🙌🏽
I think the right brow looked more natural. And can't beat the price.
I think after your scandal I believe you have matured and became positive
I didn’t think I could love you any more but then you quoted Hot Rod...😂 Cool beans
I’m going for the OG here..ABH takes the cake!!👸🏼👑  You seriously have the best brows though!!  Thanks for comparing these two brow products..another great video!!  Love you, Manny!!💖😘 xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo 🌙🌙
Yaasss! I love your reviews, especially on Kylie Cosmetics! Will you review Kylie Skin too?
You should have done this blind, like the brands should’ve been hidden. I feel like the review/comparison would be more honest
I just love your personality lol ❤️
I'm so pleasantly surprised at kylie's prices for these they're cheaper than abh and benefit
You could use that $7 and get a whole other eyebrow pencil from another brand lmao
The bloopers are always my favorite lol 😂
I've been watching Kylie for years, and for once I can clearly support this launch. I really want to try the brow powders because they leave more room for error. Might buy it.
You’re my favorite person. Done. 😘
WE LOVE U!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
The beauty community needed this upload today.
Happy that Manny is swerving all tea with James, restraining himself from tweeting ect, good on you Qween❤️
Thanks Manny please just stick to cool videos keepem coming you are doing 👍
Browtastic 😂😂😂😂  nothing better than watching manny in the morning
I love ending a long day of work with a Manny video on a Monday!! It's my little escape 🙌❤
The Kylie side looked good but Anastasia will always be THE QUEEN of brows. It just is what it is.
You should test out Kelley Baker products vs Kylie cosmetics . Fyi Kelleybaker grooms and styles all the kardashian and jenners eyebrows.  Kelley is amazing , look her up on instagram
Please make the laugh at the intro always . I love it so much . And make it so cringy sometimes please man Ily
I love you!!! Your the best ❤️❤️
and i oop- i swear i see this in every video now and it gets me all the time 😂😂😂
I miss makeup vids. Do some eye looks manny <3. I need some makeup therapy <3
RELIEVED to get a break from James and back to the make up! Going to order my highlighter from you Friday manny!!
Hey Manny 😍😘💄
Love watching your videos Manny. Will definitely try out the Kylie brows
So much love for Manny 🧡💛💙💜
4.20 KILLEDDDD ME 😂😂😂😂
Love you the most Manny ❤
I just want to hug you. You have the best energy!!
Btw love your eye tattoo

Your lips are popping
She totally copied the Queens whole brow collection
Manny!!!!!! You are the BEST!
Really brow-tastic ⚡️
Will always be your supporter !!!! 🙂🙂
Okay but I want to see you come out with a brow product
You look amazing and love the color background
So I know it's all about the brows..but I'm truly gagged over your face!! What did you use!?!?Your skin is looking flawless!! Thank you for a makeup tutorial..uughh I needed it w all this Drama!!
i feel like the title was just trying to start something!!! did kylie copy anastasia?? i do love you i just felt that kind of vibe 💕
Really want to try a brow pomade. But a lot of brands don't have a good color match for me. So it's still ABH for me for now
Can the Ky-Brow be at ulta so we don't have to pay shipping? Thanks!
honey can you review the Huda beauty tantour I wanna know about it
“ Can I see your Homework?” “ Yeah! But like don’t copy me” 🤣🤣🤣❤️ Manny your the best your such an inspo!! Your so funny and always make me laugh when you post your videos❤️❤️ stay true! Wishing nothing but happiness in your life!😩😭❤️
And I OOP in the thumbnail😂😂😂
THANK YOU FOR NO DRAMA ❤️❤️❤️
Damn it's weird seeing manny not interfere with the drama good boy
“Arrres whet arres, nnkee?” 
I live for this part of all your videos!🔥
Manny, I love you . ❤
It’s so nice to see an actual makeup tutorial...These other gurus are too damn busy trying to take each other out to realize where their focus should be but is not.
I love the "out takes" at the end :)
Yay 😀 waiting on you manny ❤️
In conclusion, Kylie’s is cheaper but Anastasia has more pigment but ALMOST the same quality
You & Laura are my favs. Fo Eva Eva
I wanna try the Kylie brow powder 😍
I love this so much like girl let’s talk about your face! It’s so * cuteeeeee 💗
Thank you for doing a review
adhesive is the word you were lookin for 🧡
I use a brush to blend out the brow highlighter and it makes a HUGE difference!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 can I see your home work, yeah but like don’t copy me! Dead!
Remember when Manny and Patrick were the reigning kings of makeup YouTube? I miss that
Sometimes I dont care about the product but I watch because you're hilarious!
Manny I love you! :)
Omg yay I’m so happy to see you post!! I needed this. So tired of the drama. Can I just say your so beautiful 😍 you don’t need a drop of makeup anywhere. Your just a lil hottie 😘 I haven’t ever gotten to try either of those brands for the eyebrows anyway. What do you recommend for super thin eyebrows. Shadow it pencil or dip? I struggle so bad with my brows. I need help in a major way. Your should totally do a video about picking a fan from your comments and helping them learn what there worst struggle is, makeup wise. Help a sista out lol I love you and thank you for making the best videos ever! Your a breath of fresh air 🥰😍😘
What about the kybrow gel? I wanna know if it actually makes the brow hairs hold in place
Thank you for talking about GOT seriously I’m obsessed and totally had good vibes watching this lmfao
I actually like the Kylie brow better 😩
My  all time favorite YouTuber 😍😍
I love ya Manny! You always make me laugh, comedy and makeup my favs💜💜
the real test of the Kybrow pomade is if it dries out as quickly as ABH, casue KVD doesnt dry out and is creamier
omg "gaywatch" ive been binging the old school Baywatch TV series for a few days now, LOL.
Can we just take a moment and appreciate Manny out here doing his dam thing, staying in his own lane and NOT being the center of the drama. Manny is just out here doing his dam thing 😍❤️😍❤️😂
Loveeeee your got references ! And love uuu
Your bloopers are the best part 😂😂
I love you, Manny. You have never changed in your content. You’re so funny. And I wish you could do my makeup. Or something lol. I have never tried ABH. Too expensive lol
Yaaas, give us some more videos!! 😍😍😍😍
I think Anastasia is a queen when it comes to eyebrows 👸🏻 and it looks better but Kyle’s price is very reasonable. Overall they both look good on you manny 💕💕💕💕💕
Come and do my brows! I can't do a brow to save my life.
I'm laughing so hard right now. That's exactly what I did to my eyebrows the first time I used Dipbrow. I looked like Groucho!
Ok, the Kylie looks like you put it on with a shapie. Not as natural as the ABH.
i love u manny 😂❤️
Manny, that laugh in the beginning 😂😂
Hey! Any thoughts on the brow gel?
Manny Mua  you are hilarious!!!Love you
Can I just say.......thank you!!!!   For not being dramatized.  So over that ish.   Love your channel .   Hope Arya slays on the last episode,  she is a true queen!!!!
They look hella similar..shooketh
I like it to be a little bit more firm. Lol
 
We all like it when its firm 😂😂
Literally gasping for an actual make up video this week! All the drama and heavy predator breathing videos were just too much!
Great video, just wish it was longer🙁
Wait a damn min is manny on Circe's side um yuck Khaleesi all the way
love how you used GOT 😍
Never thought I’d go to a manny video to escape James drama lol 💕
On the bright side, at least Manny Mua didn’t get in onto the drama. Love it.
Lol what happened with the right eyebrow manny 🤣
What about the brow gel comparisons? 🤔 I would have loved to seen that as well! Otherwise great video 👍🏼 love you @Mannymua 😍
So happy you did this! I was thinking of purchasing the kit because it comes with the gel and I thought the price wasn’t bad. But wanted to hear about it before spending my money because of course there will be a restock 🙂
You’re back on kyles PR list?
Love u manny !!!!! Ur the bomb
You're looking so rosy and glowy babe 😍
Why have I not been getting notifications for your videos? What is this bs YouTube? Show me Manny!!!
Can we PLEASE get a tutorial on the pink & blue look from your snapchat?! GORG!! 😍
i love you manny. when are you coming out with more. ????
Your skin has been looking bombbbbbb lately!! And I love the pink background!! 💓 love you manny
Doesn’t it balance out since you have to pay for shipping where as ABH you can get just in stores??
Games of Thrones ❤️👑. I ❤️ all ur videos
I didn’t even see your tweet about uploading, my timeline is so full of JC drama. I had to come over here and look on your channel. Thank god you’re out here keeping things moving 😂
im surprise i havent heard from him from the drama anyone else? lmao
There’s only so many ways you can make packaging for eyebrow products!!
The Situation edit killed me 😂😂😂
Both brows look good so that's cool and it's a lil bit cheaper alternative.
Love your videos! 💗 your energy is insane!
The finger guns got me 😂😭❤️
finally someone that posted an actual makeup video
THANK YOU 🙏🏽
Jon Snow is gonna own that thrown #MannyMua  ILY ❤️🧡💛💚♥️💙💜🖤
I’m behind but I love the game of thrown’s talk
I love you so much.. just here to say you’re amazing ♥️♥️
Ugh GAME OF THRONES IS ALMOST OVER!!!!!
We love us some Manny❤️
thank goodnesssssss. i needed this 🥳
Manny I have a serious question.
“It’s so fluffy I’m gonna die” 😂😂 Manny, you’re my faaavv 😂❤️
I just love you so much!! 😂
Ok, can I just say, you look so happy! There's just something about you lately that I'm loving!  😍😍
You are just the cutest Manny 🥰
I rather watch Manny mua instead of James Charles .
I forgot how funny you are with those accents lol
10:56 Anastasia ah! Kylie huh!!
Kawaii😂😂
I LOV U MANNY, I FOLLOW U FROM CHILE! <333
I just love watching YOU!
Is it weird that Kylie's package reminded me of Life's A Drag Palette?
Mannyyyyyyyyy I missed your face biiiiiiiiiitch
Anastasia looks way better but Kylie’s for the price it’s ok 👍🏼
Mannyyyy i root for u doing ur own thing 😊
honestly just love you for the hot rod reference
Great video!! Lovey it! P.S. Who was the guy you popped up on the screen when you said “Kybrow Shituation?” He was hot and I need to google him.
Manny mooch has still not recovered
I love the intro so much!!
Its my mom...LMFAO that's the only person that calls me soon yeah... Live for u Manny
1:20 was the cutest ♥️
After the finale of GOT can you please do a GRWM while giving your opinion of the episode and the final season??? I would love that 😻😻😻
and i oop🤭
Anastasia dip brow is the best.
Well he had to humble tf down lmao
I don't get the hype over Kylie products. Her lip kits dry out my lips and always end up looking cracked, her eyeshadows are ok but over all I just see hype.
Can you do a Make up without a Mirror Challenge!? Idk if anyone’s done it yet, just thought it’d be interesting 😂❤️
What about the brow gel? Thats what i wanted to know. I love the one from abh
i just went on here to see if manny would post something concerning the james ordeal, and im so happy to see he isnt trying to capitalize on the drama. shows growth and that he was humbled by everything that went down. :)
Anastasia is the queen her brow products are good. 😏
u know we like u babe. Thank u for making a makup video.
Omg manny I was right next to you at our MINT counter in New York and I wanted so bad to say hi and take a pic but I had to keep calm and be professional lol love you!
i love starting my day w you manny
Can you go on tour? I bought James Charles tour tickets before everything went down and um... can you go on tour?
Your shirt was the best part and you at the end saying you were texting your Mom. So relatable
Wish I could have dropped everything
Lol you just made it THAT much harder for me to decide on which brand to buy from 😭😂😂
idk why i dont watch more of manny's vids... he gets me weak omg
I already have the ABH Dipbrow, ABH Brow Powder and ABH Brow Pencil.... I might try Kylie's Brow Pencil though everything else I'm sticking with ABH!!
Honestly I like the way the Kylie side. I feel like it looks more “natural”
That laugh 😭😂 love you Manny ❤️!!!!
I literally came to your channel to avoid the damn James Charles drama.... Thanks for giving us something else to watch, Manny!! I swear these viewers love drama more than anything else- it’s obnoxious!!! 😘😘😘😘
Should of done colourpop instead of abh
Dip Brow is almost $35 in Australia wahhhhhh 😂 Her products are exactly the same ideas and such similar packaging 🤷🏽‍♀️ Love you Mannyyyyyy x
where do i get that abh brow palette
You are too funny   I love watching you always making my day !! Good for you to STAY YOU !!! No spoilers on the throne. Ha ha.  Love you Manny
love you! you kill me :D :P
i literally love you 😭
Yassss!!! Thank you for reviewing the kylie brow products been waiting for a good review
Of course we came here for you!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Just he’s intro is amazing
Kye in my language means fart 😂😂. So this video was funny to me
Manny are u okey, I mean seriously  different shades in one thing not a special effect like if u say this benefit came with that first, that was so stupid to say this
Okay so I was watching while getting ready (thanks for keeping me company) (and also wasn’t paying the most attention) and made my judgement as I was looking back every once in a while. I really like the Kylie brow!
Waiting for Manny to use the brow gel, but love how fair Manny always is! Love love love!!!
Manny the only one providing actual content
Loving that pink background hunay!! 💗💗
You seriously are hilarious! You kill me!!
IRR ISS WHARR IRR ISS
Omg thank god I would be so sad if he would of got into the drama I love him so mush
teach me your spanish 😂
Sis you should do a primer water before your foundation and try spraying your face with a fixing makeup spray to hydrate you face as you do your makeup to prepare for the powder
Can you please review her skin care line?
im glad u are just getting better and better in whatever u did. and has moved on from everything had happened
The Kybrow looked pretty good. I've been wanting to give Anastasia a try, but I suck at matching a color to my eyebrows, so I haven't bothered. I suppose I'll stick to drugstore until I get it right. 😂 My eyebrows are black, dark browns look unnatural but black is too intense.
But what highlighter are you using??
Looking at you I feel like the Kylie look so much better!!!!!!❤️❤️
I like the Kylie brow better! 😍
Aw man, I thought you were going to put Jackie’s and I op in the video. Lol
Game of thrones, wow its was so sadly interesting
Hey manny! I get married in about a month and I was wondering if you had any suggestions for my wedding makeup? I hope you see this before then💗
Finally a makeup video, I’m so over all the drama in the makeup community. I want makeup videos thank you for delivering and being the drama free queen that you are!
Love you Manny😍❤️❤️
I like the Kybrow better your brows look way better with the Kybrow😍😘
I so love your out-tros!! Hilarious!
He knows who pays his bills. It will be crazy for him to say kylie. I will never over pay just to have Kylie’s cosmetics.
Do some eyeshadow Videos bright colors  
!!
kylie’s pink aesthetic is giving me life 😩
ABH for life ❤️❤️
He cracks me uppppp omfg
To me the Kylie brow actually looks better.
Wet n wild has a nice brow shimmer that works great in the water line
You’re awesome Manny ❤️💋
Manny bitchhhhhh this was what I needed after a drama packed weekend. this my safe place
🤣🤣 Poor baby. Love you still.
Love the movie hot rod !!! And you to manny 😬😘
Update on the product like if it dries out through the months / weeks of the product being opened. Anastasia’s dip brow does get a little hard after 2-3 months of using it and I haven’t even gotten to use half the product. But you’re right. Best product this far.
OMFG love hot rod and that cool beans scene lmao literally have been referencing that movie for years now
Can I copy your homework? Sure but don’t make it obvious lol oh goodness. Love this review and how Manny tries to stick in some jokes in there lol
Love you Manny foreves!
Ooh Manny please do a Game of Thrones eye look. Hope you feel better soon
Pleaseee review the Kylie skin!! It looks pretty good to me but it could just be a gimmick! Help a girl out and let her know
I love you soooo much ❤️
Manny I love you 💕
I live for your bloopers, so funny! Love you and your videos!
I was hoping someone would make a comparison video like this and you came through!
You are loved, Manny 😍😍❤
yeah kylie's is cheaper but it's still not drugstore pricing, ya know. if I'm not gonna splurge on Anastasia then I'd go to a drugstore instead of buying Kylie + paying for shipping
Love love love ❤️ 💕
I love you manny so much, I really hope one day you and Jeffery reunite ❤️life is too short to be on this bs, atleast reach out...people do forgive ❤️hope you see this comment one day 😔
Manny ❤️❤️
And I oop... 👀😂😂😂
Okay I love the GOT reference 😂 the thing is .... who do you think should have the throne Manny???
Omg the despicable me reference 😂
Love you Manny.  You so pretty.
I love mannys humour I could watch him all dayyyyy
Lol the end when you say cool beans 💀😂
oml ive never been this early d a m n o k a y
I love both brands you’re reviewing but I’m just here for the ColourPop price and brow products! 💁🏼‍♀️ But I cannot and will not buy anything other than ABH clear brow gel!!! Nothing else can compare!
Love ur personality
Could’ve just reviewed it like a regular review, why do you need to compare it to something else?
Love ya manny 🥰
I love how there is so much drama in the beauty community on Youtube right now and Manny is just over here doing his brows
thank you for sticking to the program!!!
I’m totally trying these Kylie brow products! Thanks🤗
I love manny 😩😹😍
Y’all watch it I hope you do? 😂😂😂

I like the glossiness of your lips!! It cute 😍
G.O.T references killed me 😂❤️ PLEASE DO A KYLIESKIN REVIEW 😍😍😍I’m dying to know how you like them!!
The Hot Rod reference 🥰🥰🥰🥰 lol
I love you Manny ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Out of everything Kylie cosmetics has put out this is what I’m most excited for!
The kylighter brow looked really good, don’t know why he shaded it

I like the Kylie better tbh looks better and more fluffy
Your skin is on 10000%!!!yasss!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
Well. If you want to save some bucks...Kylie's nice...but Anastasia's are the OG 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Yassss I wanted to see this

Is this Manny's Game of Thrones prediction????
I don't even do my brows,  I'm just here for Manny.
Has some Dan Levy eyebrows for a little while !!! 😂
Why do I want Kylie’s purely for the pink packaging
MANNY IS A QUEEN🤩
Kalisia 😂😂😂💀

I thought benefit was the queen of brows
I know Manny so glad he's not apart of the makeup meltdown
yes i like you manny. i loooooove you 💖💖💖💖
😍😍😍😍😘
Thank you for posting Manny 😊. "Browtastic" I love that 😂😊.
I need another video of Manny speaking Spanish!!!!

YOURE so cute omg 😭🥰
manny!! please try indonesian makeup product, for example when you attend beauty fest asia, there's woman who named tasya farasya gave you her makeup palette!!
Finally a video thats got nothing to do with all that james drama im getting abit bored of it.
You’re the cutest thing everrrrrr!!!😍😍😍
Do a Kylie v Colourpop video!!
WOW FIRST TIME FOR FINALLY GODDAMN REVIEW
anastasia has him whipped lol
I love hot rod, watched that movie so many times haha cool beans 😝
Love you manny 😍💕 fun fact about me I’ve never done my eyebrows😱 I’ve never even got them waxed but my eyebrows are light because I have red hair  👩‍🦰 my eyebrows also don’t get bushy and thick they are thin lol watching this video makes me wanna do them now
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 love you Manny!
Yayyy MAKE UP!
I like the abh side betterthe Kylie side looks a little less blended
Ugh I'm at work. But I'mma book mark for ya later. 😘
omg why do i think the kylie side looks better
one of em copied, theres no way you can make a product similar to someone elses without knowing about it, and if one of them didnt know then i will be amazed if its just a coincidence
Omg, 13:31...😂
Very that. Okurrr I see you Monique 🙌
I’m dying to buy the Kylie eyebrow pencil and brow gel bundle in blonde but it’s ALWAYS sold out.  😢
love you manny❤️❤️❤️
Please do not compare Khaleesi . Just please don’t.
Sorry Manny, I don't watch it. Lol
Actually super curious
I think arya is gonna kill daenerys 🙄
the outtakes !!!! 😂 🥰
''can I see your homework?" couldn't relate more...
I can’t wait to see James video... oh wait Kylie unfollowed
No searing or sex jokes-thanks.  Lots of information.  GOT fan💕
I lyke yew i think yer so funnnnnnyyyyy 😭😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
HER NAME IS DAENERYS, KHALEESI IS HER TITLE!!!!
Was the brow gel or her brow brush any good will you please let me know thanks
Happy drama free channel! Yesss!!!...
Love you Manny ❤️
Y r ppl hating on u? What did u do? ♡♡♡♡
Finally !!  Make-up ! Thanks
Who thinks he is more revelant?
You should’ve done colourpop and Kylie brow products. Just by the pictures the products looks super similar
I enjoyed this video because you used makeup to enhance your natural appearance,instead of trying to look feminine.
I dont even remember why we hated on manny
I just love Manny❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Yeahhhh but you gotta calculate the fact that you can only get Kylie’s online and you have to pay shipping
I LOVE YOUUUU
“Do y’all watch it?😳 I hope you do!!!” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love hot rod! And you!
I dont like kilie jenner
I love you ❤️
Hi gorgeous love you
Ahhh, love manny!!
ABH looks better
What color do you use in Anastasia Brow Wiz?
Much love! 💕💕💕
Skincare coming tooo! Girls trying to get in the game
Another thing is that for international customers on the Kylie cosmetics website you have to spend 60$ for free shipping so that’s also a factor.. Anastasia it is!
He changed the laugh this time 😂😂😍😍😍
You’re skin is glowing !
I wish Manny was my friend
I want a shirt that says “it is wat it is”!
whats your highlighter wooowww
“ can I see your homework?” “ yeah but don’t copy me!”😂😂😂 you crack me up!
7 years 😂
No drama here 😍
I’ll never stop commenting 🐍
team #urbandecaybrowblade
Love it !😍
And I oooppppppppp ☕️☕️
“Errrrrrr issss wharrr err errrrrr is mmkayyyy.”
I love Hot Rod😂
A wear test would be nice.
Manny’s not looking so bad anymore in comparison to...someone else.
I’m happy for Kylie skin but yet a lot of her product isn’t always the best quality:/ so I feel like Kylie skin is going to be the same
I love how Kylie did a restock but didn’t even restock any of the kits she only stocked each brow product individually.... as if you don’t have enough money from us like please with that shit it makes me so mad I can’t even. I’ll stick to ABH I don’t cheat on my brow products if I want something cheaper I’ll go to nyx no joke love their brow powder. But with the brow products and the KylieSkin I just feel like it’s all too much at once and she’s trying way too hard right now. I’ve spent so much money on Kylie products and I do love her palettes but I’ve found so many better dupes and products in general that I’m just over paying for her name 💯.  But thank u for being honest 😘
If you’ve seen Schitts Creek , Manny is straight up David !!
and that's the tea sis
Kylie side looks wat better.
So was this made before or after last episode of GoT? Because if so Annastasia is a dead queen
My opinion, i love the brow pencil by Kylie cosmetics!! The spooly popped off tho 😐 and the pomade by Kylie seems very watery/ oily. Like it didn’t want to spread right.
Love you so much
Love you so much
I’m straight but can I get that shirt 🤨
does anyone know how either of these would compare to the morphe brow kit? :)
They look the same I would go for Kylie to save some money.
Manny! Your makeup looks great and you did a great job on your eyebrows too :) I hope you restock your collection bundle on your website soon cause I want to purchase it :) I hope you are doing well :) love your channel and videos
I'mma need a lip shade named "It is what it is!"
Love you manny
your skin looks fabulous
And the price difference to me looks like it's because of packaging and quality. Paying more "7 dollars" for better quality & packaging. And you can actually go to a store and swatch to find your matchiepooh and not struggle online.
I can’t even imagine doing arm day and then trying to hold a brush, let alone do makeup well
I remember Kylie and her mua mentioned that the highlight for the brow bone , to apply very little and blend with a flat brush ! Just letting you know since you didn’t really like it but maybe if you use it like he did than maybe you will like It? Lol anyways it’s just a tip I saw in her snap the other day lol love yaaa
Love you Manny!!
Wowwww ❤️ #notificationsquad #instafam
I have been for so long been wishing and hoping that make up would actually return back to the YouTube  beauty community and thank you to everyone that is actually doing what they are supposed to do!!!
Lmfaooooooooo “ and I Oop” 😂😂🤣
Love u queeeen
Love you😙
That laugh at the start so evil
Love 🙌🏻
I love u manny plz replay... ...
I don't like kylies make up at all. It is way to powdery, lippies are way too crusty and dry feeln, highlighters seem to wear off fast. Idunno just me. I'll pass on any of her products.
Yeeees!!!! Omg I died last night with that episode!!!! Shiit!!
Thank you manny for uploading a video about these products because I’ve actually just bought Kylie’s eyebrows products to see if they’re just as good. It’s good to have options especially pertaining to our budgets. I tend to run through Anastasia eyebrow pencil very quickly and 45 dollars a month on eye brow pencils is a lot. I’m having high hopes because I’m not as picky as u lol
😘❤❤❤
They are cousins! 👍👍👍
Are you reviewing Kylie skin ?
I love you so much
🌹❤❤❤
Great GOT analogy. Lol
Not 7 years honey lol
I love manny so much bye 👋🏼
pls check out the kylie skin tho 👀
Lmao. The laugh.
AND I ... OOP
How do you copy brow pomade lol
On a scale of 1-10 how happy are you that you aren’t the most hated person in the beauty industry anymore
But will Kylie put this in Ulta also? Because if not, you’re going to be paying for shipping unless you spend $40+ for free shipping. So technically you’re almost paying the same because Kylie is just online.
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
I love you 💕
You’re the best
Thank you so much for a wonderful make up video. I'm so tired of make-up industry tea. Great at staying in your lane and doing what you do best #makeupbae Love you from sunny South Africa
Hmmm I cant hate on Manny anymore lol
So cute, love your face Manny!!
I love you manny :’) 💗
Bran will get the iron throne
i really just love the kylie cosmetics review videos because her brand is so huge now some people can get lost in what’s good and what’s not so good
i love you manny!
🥰🥰
When highlighting your brow I wish you would have zoomed in. Can’t see what on earth you’re talking about.
Loved this video x
Love this
He is so funny 😆
Awwwe soo fluffy.so fluffy I’m gonna die...😂😂😂
Kylie is another colourpop cause she's coming out with skin care so weird
I would love to know how the pencil compares to the benefit precisely my brows. Actually a really helpful and cool video would be comparing different eyebrow pencils from different price points, like color pop, benefit, Kylie, ABH etc. love you manny!
With shipping it is the same price....
Anastasia forever wins brow products. Anastasia was the first brow product I used 4 years ago and they have the best brow products I’ve ever tried. Dip brow will forever be my baby. $18 for a product that lasts forever?? So amazing. And I buy it when Ulta has 20% off coupons😏
LOVE U MANNY
Yasss😍🥵
Full face of glossier!!
Legend
❤️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ I live for you Manny!
Love that tshirt!
Still won’t buy Kylie’s I rather pay triple than buy hers. No one does brows better than the QUEEN ANASTASIA!
yasss gueen go
Brow gel ?
❤
Hoping these go into ulta soon! Anyone know anything about that?
Cool beans! heehee! Love you, Manny!
I've never watched one episode of Game of Thrones
Where I left you?
I like this! 🙃
💕
you sound like you not tryna get kicked off anastasia PR list
That laugh at the beginning 🤣🤣
In all honesty I want to know how long does it actually take you to do your brows?
Love watching your videos!!
i lovee youuuuuuuuuu yes hunnyyyy!!
❤️
The brows look identical like if you didn't say that you were using 2 different brands I would have thought it was the same brand :)
You are OVER
Love ❤️
Anastasia hands down!
Such a nice break from the recent witch hunt
I love you chica
Why do you look different?
The Anastasia side looks more painted on, where as the Kylie side looks more natural and like how Kylie's brows always are. Which is honestly what I was hoping for, I wanted it to look like Kylie's brows if I bought a Kylie brow product you know what I mean? So I'm really pleased : )
Me ENCANTA!!
“No , no I don’t. It’s my mom” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I LOVE watching your bloopers 😂😂😂😂
Ok content
The only thing he did here was make kylie daenerys
Anastasia always wins.
SITUATION
😍😘
Ereeesss whattt eresssss 😂
😍😍😍😍😍 you 😍😍😍😍
I hate the guy Cersei is wed to. I hope they both die before the show ends .
<3
If there wasn’t an “ it is , what it is “ it wouldn’t be manny .
I think Anastasia is better
Surprisingly the prices for kylie aren't so high but she needs to perfect the formula I'd rather spend a little more with Anastasia and get a great product!
You’re so funny!! I love watching your videos!!!
what does “and i oop..” mean???
but is kylie’s waterproof?🤔 i struggle a little to take off the anastasia one which i’m okay with because it’s summer and i’m going to be in the pool 😘
Honestly for me I'd probably pick Kylie just because it worked just as good and is cheaper. If the product didn't work is good I would obviously spend the difference to get a better products but if the product is just as good and as cheaper then why not save a few bucks.
Could you start zooming in really tight so we could see what your brows look like after the product is on.
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Just can’t get behind Kylie cosmetics
Mannnyyyyy <3
Huhhhhh so fluffy I’m gonna die 🤣
💗💗
You look so pretty in the video! But I wanna know, what’s on your lips?
What does oop mean !?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I get so Frustrated when you tubers are doing someone on their eye or eyebrows and don’t zoom yet think that their video is helping me pick which one I want to buy ... point is ZOOM IN MORE MANNY PLEASE!!!
💜💜💜💜
Why are you even doing this review? From thw beginning you are convinced of Anastasia. You're not even trying like Kylie's more
Love you
Kylie's side looks way better
Un NOPAL con MAQUILLAJE que no habla ESPAÑOL
For some reason I think he tries to act extra gay as an act although he is gay.....
opinion about shawn mendes x calvin klein? i’m curious because he could kick me in the throat and i’d say thank you
Can’t wait to try these!
❤️❤️❤️
*anna ou. Why does nobody understand? Anyways, FINALLY a beauty guru finally posting. 😔😐😶😘😊😪😭😥😂
who is he?
Ew a gay dude omg why wtf!
Hola Manny 🥰
Your natural humor, fun phrases while actually making us super informed about these products is GENIUS! Ya. You're about to catapult above anyone out there!!!! 
 .... Im bursting out laughing at unexpected times.... EXCELLENT Manny. Just Love that Ur so natural .. Its not forced silliness .. You truly  have such a natural gift Bambino of education ya while being hilarious 😂...  You're theeee channel!!!!! THEEE BEST. So glad I found ya!! ❤
🧝🏽‍♀️
Weren't you the one that got exposed? It's funny how your views have PLUMMETED since then. Here's one pity view :)
IRRRRISSSSWARRRIIRRRISSSS.
I think that Kylie definitely copied the idea from Anastasia and it may be a good dupe, but the shade range sucks. I'm a little biased because Anastasia offers 2 colors for red heads and most brands skip the reds altogether.
💓💓😍😘😂😂❤️👌🏻😊💛💛💄💄
I like u
Anastasia looks better.
Subtítulos En Español Please
I’m sorry but Kylie side looks wonky compared to Anastasia
The Anastasia Brow Wiz Pencil is the biggest waste of money because it breaks off SO easily. I bought one and used it twice before I had to throw it out. I had it in my makeup bag and when I took it out the entire stick inside fell out in tiny pieces.
I use a $2 pencil from ELF and $14 for a pencil is ridiculous, let alone $21.
Love ya ! ! ! 💋 🐾
irrrrrr izz wut irrr izzz
That pink background slays! You eyebrows look good naked too’. How do you get that arch ?
coolbeans
IRRISSSS WHAT IRR RISSSSS
Lol! No I don’t. It’s my mom.
Ereeeeezzzz wharrrrrr eeerrrrr eeeeezzzzzzz
I’m in the color Ebony from Anastasia. Is Ebony the same exact color from Kylie ?? Please help ! Lol
Anastasia is better that’s why she can charge more!!!
Manny I don't care what face you make. I'm sorry for bringing this up bit I just learned of all this over a face you made!!!! What is the world coming to. I really feel these kids nowadays won't last in the real world if a face is what triggers them. Ugh it's disgusting and I'm sorry you went through that
What’s on your lips ?!xxx
Which brow brush is that?
Speaking of eyebrows, I thought your mom’s eyebrows (and makeup) looked really nice in that Mother’s Day pic on your IG stories, and I don’t normally notice eyebrows - even on celebs.
Next weeks video how I got kicked of Kylie’s pr again we no she doesn’t like honest reviews
❤️ u
What’s on your lips??
Anna ou
okay but manny was biased from the beginning he already had favoritism towards anastasia lol
They look like twins...
This is so refreshing thank you for the break manny ❤️❤️❤️
Anna ou*
James is dieing and you post this thank you at least someone has some good ass content ❤️
Manny: who’s getting the iron throne? 

Me: we all who’s not 🙄 cough jamescharles cough
Manny honestly you could have read the phone book and I would have been happy. So tired of the drama!!!!! Thank you for filming about makeup. Btw your brows look amazing
ABH made those products forever ago, it’s no secret who came up with the idea first. I just don’t think people should be butthurt over a similar looking product because if it wasn’t Kylie it would be someone else. It’s just makeup 🤷🏻‍♀️
Everyone has literally forgotten about you why don’t you just give up
Hmmm description didnt match your review?? I'm shocked at how similar kylie's products look to anna
you are literally trying so hard for views and likes .... They are literally the same kylies were even better and price point was cheaper
Manny! I want to hug you! You always come through right when I need a smile.😭💖 Love you!
I love you manny❤️😩
Manny ALWAYS makes my day better! Just watching his funny attitude and personality
Yeeesss! Finally got my notification on time!!!😊 everything was put on hold to watch mf Manny!!
Feels so nice to watch a good ole makeup review, gotta take a break from the tea ☕️ Love you Manny!
I love yaaaa Manny! Always making me laugh and TEACHING me some shit ! ❤️🇨🇦
Am i the only 1being soo triggered bc the video is 13:59 longg. I FK CAN'T 😥😫
I only even rarely wear makeup and I love watching YOU.
Oh shitttt I'm here real early, damn. But I think Anastasia is better, love u Manny💕💕
Haha Manny I always love your tv show references. It makes me feel less alone on how much I binge watch. GOT is freaking sick right now! My anxiety peaks every episode.
A new Manny giggle. Still loving it. Thank you for always making my day SO much better. ❤ ya dear!!!!
Cover girl brow pencil. Cheaper than all of em. Just as good
Manny you give me life with your sayings and your honest reviews, nobody compares!! “Iiiirissss whaattt ittttt iiirrriiiisss” 👑😘🔥🤣🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Early gang gang
Wow i'm early 😂
Omg I have no idea who’s gonna be on the iron throne. But last nights episode was insane hahah “gaywatch!!!” Boy r u still drinking sweet tea?! Lol I def wanna try Kylie’s eyebrow pencil but omg I dunno if I can just stop using abh brow pomade love you manny! Thanks for bringing joy to my Monday... I needed a break from all the drama  that happened this weekend. 💜💜💜💜🌙
I love you Manny
Even if Kylie had better products, I would never purchase from her.
The finger guns though 😂😂 Love you so much Manny❤️❤️
Been waiting all day for this 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😘
I love your videos. When do we get the full face of Can you ovulate???? I'm so ready for it!
Yay I’ve been waiting for this. I bought the kybrow and i personally like it 🥰
Mannnnnnny come to a makeup store here in San Diego!!!😁😁🤗🤗
No Drama, just makeup and some silliness... Love this!
I love you manny! 😘 Please answer my post 🙈😇
Wow! To save some money and having more product, Kylie wins that! ☝🏼🤷🏼‍♀️ Also, you said the ABH side was easier to use, but before you used both pomade, you said you didn’t use a pomade in a long time sooo the first try with Kylie was probably harder than the second try with ABH (time to re get used to it)  just my opinion love ya 💘
Yassss I watched last nights episode and I was shookith and sickith....
He didn’t come to playyyyyy with these BROWSSSSSS
I love.you Manny..sending love from kenya
literally dupes.. 110% copied.. Queen Anastasia
I love you Manny ❤️
I won’t ever buy a Kylie product. She’s trying to monopolize everything beauty and I’m not going to support that 🤷‍♀️
honestly after last night the dragon queen can take a long walk off a short pier for what she did
Love youuu😍😍😍🤤

hi sistars
Omg

WHOS LIKING OUR LITTLE BEST AND WORST MET MOMENT?! Should I do more of these
The way you defended James was incredibly mature, even though he doesn’t deserve it. When he and Tana reacted to Coachella outfits he just had an attitude about talking about you. Couldn’t even act like an adult. 

Bravo Manny for rising above!
All these outfits remind me of the Capitol in the Hunger Games.
JAMES = KINDERGARTENER

MANNY= ADULT

And that's the honest truth
lol ok nick is hella quick with the comparisons! i would haaaate to have him roast me lmao.
Not a fan but the review was pretty good and clean. Like he didn’t roasted them or drag them ,he talked about it in a professional and respectful way.
Respects from Gemany💖
I loved what you said about James Charles. Bless your soul.
I am just shocked that I don’t see more people talking about how Manny said “Pierre” from Beauty and the Beast but his name is Lumière 😂😂😂 Love you Manny💙
Totally recreate lady gaga's makeup! Congratulations on the sephora news!
Can we just appreciate how his brother knew the holding the head was from a Gucci runway show!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤
Thank you thank you THANK YOU for explaining CAMP😂
Can we all see the way Manny talked about James, yet how james acted when he was rating Coachella outfits with Tana????
Cardi B looks like I coughed while on my period. Love her tho. lol
Manny I vote you do this every year for the Met Gala. I loved it!!
100% You are a complete jewel <3 You always review everything so classy and legit. 
James Charles isn't going to know how to respond to this kind of Maturity 😂
You should attempt to recreate Lady Gaga’s make up!
You gotta feature nick in more videos!! I love how you guys vibe with each other and are really funny together
8:40 curls saying “I like the dark eyeshadow”  A MAN 🤩
PLEASE DO A MAKEUP TUTORIAL ON GAGA’S MAKEUP!!! You did say it was easy to recreate it 😘

This video was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Hang out with your brother more. 😘
Priyanka looked like the Mad Hatter more than the Queen of Hearts.
Lol you didn't mention Deepika padukone, OMG you're missing out😅
God you're sooo cute. Love this video. Kisses from Croatia. ❤️😘
I love how nice you were towards James even though he was attempting to throw shade in Tanas video.  I love that you’re the bigger person :)
Omg I liiiiiiiiiiive for the reactions from you guys 😂❤
I like that you think it’s pierre. It’s Lumiere sweetie! 😂 but that was iconic I adore you❤️

The fact your brother knew about the Gucci runway show with the heads BLEW MY MIND

14:12 Shawn!!!
“you put gaga’s bow on this? you got a christmas present” LMFAOOO
I love how ur brother didn't know joe jonas and sophie turner were a couple when they're literally married at this point😉
Thank you sooo much for not bashing James!😘
Alexander Wang chose James's makeup look too!✌❤
I think Priyanka looked more like the Mad Hatter 🤔
Also ur makeup is killing it that purple I'm dead
Omg i didn’t know nick actually knows fashion like that 😍😫 like okaaaayyyy
OMG, did Manny just do an intro without a giggle!? 😱😱
Omg this video made my day much more brighter ❤️😂
Loving the house with y’alls duo!
WHERE IS YOUR REACTION FOR COLE SPROUSE AND LILI REINHART? 👑👑
Manny and his brother are geeks! but Manny is like the pro geek coz he thought of Harry Potter related stuff unlike his bro who thought about Marvel. ROCK ON! WICKED! LOVE THEM!
PLEASE HAVE A CHANNEL TOGETHER. IM LIVING FOR THIS DUO
Manny and his brother: Saying everyone won the met and they're each the epitome of Camp the entire time.

Where we all stand: I stan the truth and agree 1000%! you both are the literal best together in a video and so fun to watch.  More, please!!
Recreate lady Gaga makeup mannnyyy 😍😘 -manny: fuccckk 😂
Looking good manny!!!! Tell us what would you wear to a met gala???^.^
Billy Porter and Lady Gaga were the bests 😍
😍😍 you and Nick together are a mood.... Love it 😘
The Yzma reference killed me!! Loved this
It's lumiere from beauty and the beast ❤️
Kylie's outfit is so Lil' Kim MTV Music Awards circa 1999
Nina Dobrev's look was AMAZING!!!! The 3D print that had to be glued on her dress!!!
His name is Lumiere* not Pierre. 😂😂😂😂💀
I studied Fashion in college and appreciated the hell out of this video. Bring your brother back more often!
this years bwawl
It was a lot of spot on comparisons and live for it!! 😂
Can you guys please do this every year lmao I enjoyed this sooo damn much 😂😂😂💖
PIERRE FROM BEAUTY AND THE BEAST😂😂Lumiere lol
Yes Zendaya is the queen of the MET! I’m glad you know!
Thank you for explaining what “camp” means. I got old at some point 🤣
I honestly want so much more of this. I. Am. Hooked.
If you’re old like me 😆, you immediately thought of Ming the Merciless from Flash Gordon when you saw Jared Leto
I literally love you two together. 👏🏽👏🏽
I love Priyanka in general but I also got Hunger Games vibes! Love you!!!!
Loved this one manny, yah are so cute. Cute vid❤️😘💕👑👑💕✌🏼✌🏼
You should definitely do more videos with Nick, you guys have such a great vibe together! 
I love the fact that you're sticking up for James. He gets so much hate it's not even funny.
That's Manny. Although James laughed at his Coachella outfit he never laughed back. Sister needs to learn from the OG🔥
Zendaya’s look was everything!!! Tbh you were both much nicer then me 😅
Notification squad!!! Who clicked it as soon as it popped up?! 🙋🏻‍♀️ Love ya Manny!!!! 😘😘😘
Thanks for this!  I've been really missing fashion police and this fills that void
Idc what anyone says about you...that was CLASS what you said about James Charles!! You and Nick did a really good job with this video. I am on old hag who loves her some Harry Styles so hearing you talk about him is why I clicked!! Again, nice job Manny & Nick 💜
You should do a video on recreates of Met Gala looks, for the next week!! That would be dope. Or maybe just a few days?! With Life's a Drag and your own take on it. <3
Manny WE NEED YOU AT THE MET GALA NEXT YEAR!!!!
Lilly Sings outfit was amazing and I'm sad u missed it.
Where was Darren Criss Met Gala outfit? It was honestly quite a moment.
manny: h-


nick: this is just like jaden smith
Gaga, Billy Porter, Ezra Miller & Kim K won it for me 🙌🏻✨🙌🏻 Obviously there were SO many amazing lewks, but those four just took my breath away 🥰
P.S. PLEASE recreate Gaga’s eye look!!! ✨🙏🏻✨🙏🏻✨
I love your commentating because I love your humor! It always cheers me up!
Who Else Clicked Faster Than Sonic🤣?

(I'm gifting subscribers) frfr
Have you watched The Cell (movie)
Cardi right there
I love skipping to the middle and seeing them calling ezra miller amazing kskd
Some of the shady comments had me dying of laughter! 😂
Congrats for the Sephora announcement so proud of you 💞💞
omg these comparisons are SOOO accurate from yzma to lumiere the candle 😂😂😂 I have literal tears in my eyes
Manny you are so awesome. I love the interaction between you and your brother. I love how you try to find something nice about everyone.
You should definitely do more vids w Nick is never to quick go be back on ur Chanel 😭 we love him
ZENDAYA wins at life💗⚡️
I love Nick! Wowza he knows his fashion. when he mentioned the gucci runway wow
WHO ELSE LOVES MANNY




BTW I'm a YouTuber too! <3
You didn’t show mama RU???? Rupauls zebra 🦓 suit lol 😂
THANK YOU for addressing the whole thing with James. Other people don't understand and they just spread negativity. 💜
I hope I'm not too old and people get this reference, but Nick and Priyanka gave me Nathan Lane and Robin Williams in The Birdcage.
Yesss always up for a bit of manny :))
Half these people probably had no idea what camp even meant...lol but this was hilarious. Love you, Manny!!
How did you not mention @IIsuperwomanII?! Her outfit was amazing
I love you guys! Manny... you are my best friend. IJS (I know you don’t know me 🙄). Lol
I love this video so much!   You have to do more of these whenever there’s a Red Carpet 
Love you Manny
Love you so much 😍😍😍 💜💜💜 thank you for getting me through more than you know! Ily xxx
Nicks wife was giving me major mad hatter vibes lol
Nah,im not haiting on Mr.Wang.im hating on james because, he decided to wear that cochella oufit.
OMG you missed Kendall Jenner!!!
Manny we want to see you re create Gaga’s makeup!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯
To those people I say this: educate yourselves. Harry used to be so worried about what others thought of him. To see him transform into this confident, beautiful man has been amazing to watch. He described the “camp” theme as a way to embrace the fun side of fashion, to allow people to be who they are. His good friend Alessandro described it as “freedom”. Harry has become so confident in himself & it is BEAUTIFUL. 😌✌🏼
YESSS I NEEDED THIS VIDEOOO ILY AND YOUR EYE SHAWDOW IS AMAZING HONEYYY IM LOVIN IT!!!
Please do a tutorial of your eye makeup! So pretty 💜🔮
I love when you say GORGA 😩🤣🤣🤣 love you 💓
Honestly loved  the look Miley and Liam did together Liam being so simple letting the focus be more on Miley i just their whole dynamic, LOVE
you’re so down to earth with such a genuinely happy and beautiful vibe❤️  absolutely love you and your videos manny!
Nick was on point with all the comparisons 💯
His name is lumière 😀😙
loved this video pls do more!!!! also love nick always! y'all are so funny.
Oooooo you should do a video recreating one of the gala makeup looks!! Love you and Nick together 💜
Nick Jonas is Petyr Baelish omg
Jared leto omllll imagine him draging the head by like a couple strands of hair lmaooooo
***Lumiere from Beauty and The Beast :) js
Um Janelle's eye boob BLINKED WHY DIDNT YOU STAN MORE?
From my honest point of view... It may not be very theme related but I think James looked amazing in his outfit. I think there has been wooooorst than It... Just my point of view.
Omg. I'd switch sides for Halsey too!
I’m living for Kim and Kylie they both looked so stunning😍😍😍💕
If Gaga´s look is easy to recreate, do it!
Always love this sibling duo!!! ❣
You forgot to talk about lily Collins and Lucy boynton 😢
You should have seen Lilly Singh outfit it was a Lily (flower) themed dress and it was gorgeous in my opinion
KINGSMAN IS MY MOVIEEEEEEEE, so under rated
don't come for harry styles or i swear to god
Honestly, i can tell I would actually vibe personality wise with manny irl. Totally
Am I the only one that doesn't know what camp is? I thought they was talking about actually camping until I watched this video.
Def want to see manny replicate GAGAS look. Next video?🤔🙏🏼
I love you manny but damn I didn’t notice before how big your head is, i just love it tho, like small heads look weird to me lol

James throws shade on manny constantly and yet manny is just all love <3 this is why i stayed subbed.
Pierre from Beauty and the Beast.... lol lol it's Lumiere, pobre Manny.

Lady Gaga slayed the met gala...#MetGaga
Gaga’s umbrella was what we call the second line. It’s a Cajun thing!
I spent all night judging the Met Gala outfits too even though I don’t know shit 😂 loved this video!
How many you should recreate a couple of the looks from Met Gala like the makeup do a recreation of Gaga at least you loved her look.
I love when you and nick do videos together!!
What he said about James😭 Legit just made me smile because James has been getting crucified. Class act, Manny ❤️
I was really waiting for Lilly Singh and Deepika Padukone..
Manny u really would have loved Deepika's out fit and makeup 😊
I love how you make each other laugh! ❤️
Pierre from Beauty and the Beast?! You mean Lumiere?
Once ya'll said Yzma I couldn't un-see it lol
Manny! Do a video on your eye look 💜💜😍
Manny judging other people’s fashion....😳
Why does Manny look like a purple dream? Tastyyyyyyy!!!!!! Loved the video 🔥
Will your highlighters be going to Sephora eventually? They look gorgeeeouussss
Manny I loved this kind of video!!
Alessandro Michele is everything.♡
I can’t remember ever seeing a makeup artist critiquing makeup at a red carpet event and I think that’s a great idea. Plus I hadn’t payed much attention to this event so it was nice to get the highlights in a 20 minute vid. Also, kudos for making this a positive, fun video. Well done. 👍
Mannys outfit is SO EXTRA today!!!
To me Prianka looks more like the mad hatter from Alice 😂
Did you see Keilidh’s Gaga recreation???
Anybody else get Alyssa Edwards vibes from Gaga's look?
Zendaya’s outfit was the best love her 😍
What about Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart you didn't talk about their outfits
Jared Letto?? I thought it was Russel Brand!
OMG...You have to recreate Lady Gaga’s eye look
One of my favorite videos from you! I just love how funny you are, do more like this for sure! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I vote more videos with Nick. Your banter is really funny and you just vibe off each other so well. Loved this video, I say definitely do more! ❤️
Did you see the back of Harry Styles shirt? It added to  it even more for me💜
Yaaaas Nick 🔥🔥🔥
Tysm Manny for definint the word ‘Camp’ for us, srsly. Ilysm!

Loved it! Should be an annual video for u both! NEXT year you should dress up with the theme!!!
I wish you showed Kendell Jenner's fit! LOVE IT!
Oh. My. Lord. Talk over each other some more 😡
Love this so much but the candle from Beauty and the Beast is definitely “Lumière” not “Pierre”😂
Nick was hilarious with his 1st impressions in all of the outfits 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Damn nick is so informed on the fashion from the past! And on his references 😂
Love this video you should do more like it!

Love this!! Let’s do this again ok because I was judging with you!
Ezra wins though all the way!
Manny with any family or friend in the video! 👍👍👍 Manny is obviously so happy with them there.  ✨😃
Super biased but I love cardi B she is amazing and iconic I just wish that you would have showed Kris Jenner
I just have so much respect for you Manny! You have a way of keeping it classy yet hilarious at the same time. Professional and silly. Props!
This would have been better if nick stuck to his opinion instead of changing it whenever manny had a different opinion. 
Nick: I don't like it. AT ALL
Manny: I think it's really beautiful I like it
Nick: I actually really like it. 

Like he did that a bunch of times.
First! Love you so much my fellow 4th April Aries baby ♥️
9:43 PREACH 👏 couldn't agree more!
3 words. Epitome of camp
Omggggg a tutorial for today's looooooyyyyk please?😍😍😍😍😍😍 so stun, so is the makeup 😘
Eza slayed it he ruled. Best dressed of the gala.
I'm biased, because Gaga is a queen to me, but ZENDAYA SLAYED THE GAME YAAS
As always.. YOUR THE BEST!!!!!!
Liam looked so hot though 🔥
Pierre?!? 😂😂😂 LUMIERE! 💛
KK slayed. It’s literally CAMP as fuuuuuuuuck.
I Love James but Honeyyy Noo so Much Potential..but I feel Alexander Wang chose James specifically cuz of this look it's Soo james
“The gag(a) of the century!” Please do a video of your purple eye look. It’s GORGEOUS. PS Manny sticking up for a fellow YouTuber 👍🏼 .
Love ya the most luv❤️
omg thank you for the references and comparisons of the met gala outfits to the Disney characters omg I was thinking the sameee!!
Whelp I also don’t know jack about fashion but I feel better that at least 90% of this I agreed with
You were so spot on about James. Thank you for saying that, omg. People are being horrible about it :(
CONGRATS on being in Sephora!!!!
You should for sure recreate some of these makeup looks!
The Michael B Jordan comments.....I DIED!! So funny yet SO true. Lol! 🤣
U missed Lilly Sing I was waiting for it but it never came
Omg I love looking at nick. So hot 😩😋❤️
manny, it’s lumiére, not pierre... 🕯😂
Awww I love videos with you and nick. The relationship you have with your family is goals. And congrats on Sephora Manny!!! Omg I’m so happy for you! 🙌🙌🙌🙌
i seen the title, clicked it, realized it was manny mua, now im out lol
Harry’s outfit was the best💙
I love videos where it’s you and your brother chilling, it makes me feel like I’m there hanging out with you guys 😂 loved this video and you, Manny 💓💓
WHERE TF IS NICKI AT
You forgot Bella & Kendall :(
Take a shot every time he says "it's the oppitamy of camp"
Janelle monae, is serving Oblina vibes from Ahhhhhh Real Monsters. 👁️💋👁️
Love this guys. Manny is my absolute favorite person. YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS betch
um why is noone talking about this collab channel that should be happening!!!!
Wait.... Pierre??? You mean Lumière? 😂😂😂
Didn’t show her but I loveddddd Lily Collins look soooo much
Love this review - it isn't just about laughing at others. It's legit, it's honest, remembers the theme, considers the improvement and congratulates the successes. PERFECT content for the world right now!
Um, hello what about the FREAKING QUEEN JLO!!!!!!! 😍🥰
Damn how does nick know so many things to reference these outfits to😭
JAMES CHARLES DOESN’T DESERVE YOU BABY UGH
Lilly Singh was also their. You didn't even react to her outfit. It was SICKENING
Honestly I love Manny so much💖
7:06 "as old as she is" she's only 51! She's not THAT old
Please, Please, Please do more of these videos! Loved it.
you and your brother need to do this for all red carpet events.  Joan Rivers used to do one with her daughter.  I love it!!
On point with all your opinions!  Living for this pretty purple/pink eye!  So gorgeous!
That Gucci moment was so much creepier cause that guy already had such a lifeless look to him
Tessa Thompson and Darren Criss won it for me!
Aw I didn't know you guys had matching earrings, cute :) OMG I love the purple eyeshadow look Manny
I was waiting for nicks reaction to Katy Perry’s HAMBURGER 🍔!
Watching this from across the globe in the UK! ❤️ congratulations with conquering Sephora! Queen!!!!
Kendall is pretty good too!! Wish to see u react to her lol
Love watching your videos 🥺🥰🥰And your sense of humor 😇❤️❤️❤️
Yasss you should do more like this with your brother !
This was great. Do it again for sure!!
Where’s the rest of the notification family ???😍👀 My bro’s name is Nick 🙊
Manny how did you not think that Nick Jonas looks EXACTLY like LITTLEFINGER FROM GOT!!!!!
For me Kendall had the best outfit and make up ever 😍🧡🧡🧡
Kinda sad how your view count has plummeted since getting exposed. Oh well, here's one pity view :)
i loved this video but i was cringing the whole time you were using he pronouns for ezra miller haha
Lmaooo when you turn str8 a quick sec for Halsey 💕
Liza Koshy did pick her outfit many.. And you're wrong the designers give the celebrity options to choose from. James chooses the outfit so did Liza and so did everybody else
James Charles looked fantastic and I love love love Harry Styles outfit.
You left out Darren Criss😭
Loved the Isma comment.  Hilarious
You didn't mentioned deepika... She was also there... But yess true about priyanka what you said...
Nick is on point with his comparisons and references. Damn- at the snap of his fingers he can pull someone out of no where that these outfits resemble. I love you guys! Pls adopt me
For loving drag so much, not talking about Violet Chachki and Aquaria was a choice.
MANNY WHAT ABOUT KACEY MUSGRAVES’ OUTFIT?! Probably one of my favorite looks!
LOVE Cardi B's outfit! However I wish her headpiece would've looked something more like the one Mila Kunis wore in Jupiter Ascending when she was about to get married.
Look at Manny's head size compared to Nick's. (Not a read Manny 🤣)
Please do more reviews I love this!!!
Oh my god the comparisons 😂 I’m dying!
Manny keep doing videos like this! Definitely enjoyed it. ❤️
Yeaahhh I’m gonna need you to make more videos like this. Hillllaaaarious
Jared Leto looks like Jesus. A glammed up Jesus.
Meanwhile...
Kim K be looking like a cockroach. A glammed up cockroach.
nick is indeed a beautiful man 😍
I’m LIVING for this video!!! Yes yes yes please do more!!!!
I wish you would have reviewed Lily Collins’ makeup 😭
Your matching EARRINGS. ABSOLUTELY STAAAANNNNN
Priyanka was in all the best dressed. She followed the theme and executed it well. SHE ATE
I was waiting for you to do Nina doprevs glass dress! Ughhhh lol
You should recreate Kim's make up!
manny your brother would look really good w short hair
priyanka😍😍😍
Favorite was Kendall 🧡, Worst was James Charles 🤮
OF COURSE GAGA WON 💖🖤💖🖤
You both did a fantastic job reviewing. Manny you know more about fashion than you think. Can I just say you are slaying the purple!!! You are that biotch!  Nick you are so damn cute... come join channel anytime!! You both should do more of these videos together. You bounce off each other so easily. I loved the Met Gala this year! So many Oh my word moments. Ta-ta see you soon
Priyanka Chopra is a former Miss World and an actress not a youtuber.
Pierre his name is Lumiere 😂😂😂
Priyanka looks like a mix of the Queen of Hearts and the mad hatter lol
11:06 Here is the reason why I'm here ... Priyanka Chops 😙
This has got to be the worst video😭🥴BUT I STILL LOVE YOU MANNY
I wish they would hire you to do makeup for the met gala
Bring his gf back she’s super awesome❤️
Add Lady Gaga's bow..... shell look like a Christmas present 🤣🤣🤣🙌🏻
This is the Manny I love. Relatable, fun to watch and not awkward or forced. Please keep these up.
Liza’s look reminded me of the float challenge too!!
Love this,  you and your brother are so cute!!
These are literally my favorite kinds of videos
James Charles didn't even try, girl!
In regards to Joe and Sophie..”are they dating” um yes, they are married! 😂
What you said about James 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 the FIRST person I’ve heard stand up for him!!! I liked your video just because of that bc people was bashing him so hard
Why does Nick look kinda like Matty Healy from 1975? 😄
Cardi B was 🔥🔥 btw your makeup is gorgeous ❤️
Manny i live for this
How is it that most of the guys are wearing heels.. getting 1700's vibes lol
YOU HAVE TO COME ELTON JOHN READY 👌🏽
I love you Manny congrats on sephora hunny
MANNY! This is perfection and the review/judge time we all needed. Tbh I’m glad you included the YouTubers, and I’m SO GLAD they are now being invited to the Met Gala 💕
#mannyformet2020
I think they meant lumiere not piere 😂
LOVED this video!  It's so fun watching the two of you together.  It would be wonderful to see the two of you continue to do more videos together, and have this become a regular thing.  I really enjoyed listening to your fair and diplomatic perspectives on the makeup / fashion.  This could be a regular thing for you guys, especially given that your brother went to FIDM - - The Oscars, Film Festivals (Cannes, TIFF, Sundance, Tribeca, etc), Grammy's, BAFTA, etc.  Thank you both for all of your hard work!
omg i love that nick knows fashion!!
It terrifies me how much I love Halsey too!!!!!! Lol omg!!!
I love these videos, something diff, YASS. If only manny where straight 😍😍😍 dont mind me, being obbbsessed with manny.. he is sooo cute..
Isn’t the chandeliers name lumière not Pierre 😭
What a great video! You were really respectful and explained your opinions further, it wasn't just yay or nay type of shit you really explained why you liked or disliked certain outfits and even if you disliked you complimented something in the person which was lovely! Nick's memory is too good and for example how he connected Jared Leto's outfit to the Gucci runaway show, I had no idea that was a thing! Also love how you talked so respectfully about James and explained that he did not choose the outfit, people are hating on him way too hard! I were a bit disappointed about some people, there are so many events for celebs to look nice and pretty but met gala is for going crazy, being unique and different and especially this year when the theme was camp! Some people really should've just stayed home if they didn't even bother to try with the theme... Gotta mention Rami Malek, he always looks good and i love him and yes this was his first gala but... the dude has played Freddie Mercury for god's sake, he should know how to rock a camp style but he didn't and i was very disappointed. But gotta say there were soo many great on theme outfits and actual fashion statements and i'm living, Ezra Miller and Zendaya were my favourites out of all!
Wow i loved this. I’m gonna need more of this!!!
Okay sis we need a video on those eyes ASAP!
Manny is me when I see every single photo of Shawn Mendes
Judge moment.... critique? haha
Nick just looking at himself the whole time instead of the camera 🙄 please look over here at the lens mr.handsome 😫
SO DRAG RACE BOAT CHALLENGE 😂
I LIVE FOR YOU DOING THIS TYPE OF VIDEOOOoooO
I vote Manny for next year's Met Gala!💜
Manny his name is not Pierre its Lumiere lol from Beauty and the Beast..its ok I still love you
Sophie and Joe are married now. You guys are behind! 😁
So happy to see Lunar Beauty at Sephora!! Can't wait until my Greek Goddess eyeshadow palette arrives
You missed Darren Criss!!! He slayed
Nick's comments are on point!
Cardi B looks like a tampon! 😂
“Nick Does Outfits” that’s all I need!
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW HALSEY OMYGOD BOMB!!!
pierre?? you mean lumierre?😂
For me halsey won the met gala❤😂
I love this video bc I haven’t seen anything about the Met!!!   This was so different than your make-up ones and I LOVED it !  Do more of these.   Love ya and have your brother on with you more.  He looks like he would be a no brains/drooler, but he is so far from that!  You two have that vibe going and play off of each other perfectly.  (Side bar-  Manny stop running your hand through your hair so much.  You have bomb 💣 diggity hair!)
Im waiting to see any MUA re creating gaga’s makeup look
Literally did the best I’ve heard and been able to understand at describing “Camp” hahah love you Manny 😘
I'm sorry for correcting you, but it's Lumiere from beauty and the beast.
Ok love this and yall also i love your shirt manny !
Sorry.. But... The Met Gala reminds me of parties in the hunger games!!
I though Camp was literally like camping...like in the woods with a fire
You and your brother should buy each other's outfits and have his gf be the judge 😎
Ahaha touch your hair one more time 😂 jk jk
Manny! You should do a video challenge where you try to get through the whole video without touching your hair! It’s be pretty funny
You mean Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast. Manny, come on, lol.
Just wanted to point out that it's lumiere not pierre from beauty and the beast lol, but hated jaty perrys version of it
Your brother super reminds me of Matty from the 1975
Omg Harry Potter reference I think me and celebrities have a different views of camp lol
Y'all talking about the celebrities but i'm over here like "you see Nick tho? Lookin' fiiine!" Have him in more videos pls!!! Also love your guys' relationship! So cute ♡
I wish you included Deepika Padukone she was stunning
Could you recreate some of these looks I.e gagas
still here waiting for "if youre new what's up I'm manny mua thank u so much for being here
Hey love I’m so proud of you and I’m so excited to see your pallets on display at  Sephora !!!  And also I love how you stood up for James even though he does NOT deserve it that goes to show that you are a kind soul just wanted to say that was so mature of you !!
WHY DIDN’T YOU GIGGLE IN YOUR INTRO🥺😭
I think if they just said, "dress like the citizens that live in the capital from the "Hunger Games"," than most of the designers would've nailed it better with the whole "Camp" theme.
Manny you should recreate Lady Gaga look on you !!!!
Dang so much comments to like wounder if I be 🍀 lucky
Your eyeshadow is so pretty💜
I really loved this video from you Manny! I think it's something different from what you usually do but your editing is on point with all the references of what you guys were comparing the outfits to and i loved the commentary from both you and Nick. It seems like beauty you tubers get stuck with ther their content and it gets old and stale and the viewer's just get bored and either unsubscribe or just watch maybe a couple min of their video's and then click off. So, i think it's smart to change it up every so often. You're not going to grow on you tube if you don't or wont take risks in my opinion, which doesn't really mean shit considering i've never filmed a video before so i guess i should say from an outsiders perspective. Anyway definitely keep it up! 😜
no priyanka looks like Elizabeth banks in the hunger games lol
I love you mannny!! You’re so graceful with judging all these outfits and makeup. I love it! Can’t get enough of you 😭💕💕
Purple is EVERYTHING on you
Girl, why didn’t you go to the met gala?? You would have slayed!!!
Lixa actually did get choices...she made a video about it so ....her other options were better
Can I have your brother as my dinner 🤑🤑🤑
G
A
G
A

That is all
Look at the monitor not me 🤣🤣
James is at the Met because he was invited by YouTube, not because THE MET INVITED HIM. 👏🏼 👏🏼
Katy killed it🔥🔥
Kim K looked AMAZING. Her & J Lo were my favs. But I’m partial, I’m just a J Lo fan LOL.
Liza killed it as an interviewer!
Livinggggggggg 💀💀💀💀
GAGA is amazing.💜💛
You said it would be easy to recreate lady gaga's look.... DO IT! Prove to me how easy it is lol. Would love a "recreating MET Gala looks" 😋
Is it just me, or is the yearly met gala really similar to the parades they do at the hunger games?😂
Unfortunately, what you said about James is wrong. Stars are given options from their designers to choose from, something a few people talked about with their interviews on the Met Gala carpet. Its nice to see youtubers sticking up for other youtubers, but please fact check before making a statement.
I think most of them at the met this year are sicking the country and I love them all sooooo much!!
Btw, why no one’s talking about Jerad leto and his look with his head thingy that he’s holding!! he was looking like a GOD
I would LOVE to see a make-up look inspired by Billy Porter’s look! His outfit was bomb and I think a shiny gold look on you would look amazing! 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
WE NEED A PART 2!!!
Love Gaga ♡☆luv ya'll ♥
I’d love to see how easily you do that Gaga makeup lewk!
You didnt do Lilly Singh's look. I mean her dress idea was pretty cool... 😏🙂
it’s lumière not pierre 😂😂
Gaga did win I agree 🙌🏼
Where I’m from camp means outdoors, bonfires, hunting 😂
The plan is to look even prettier than before.. 💃..
Love watching u n ur brother 👍🏼💕
Manny should recreate some of these Met Gala makeup looks, or do makeup looks that are inspired from the Met Gala event.
you should so recreate Gaga's look
I’m so glad you’re back. Missed you so much. You’ve cheered me up when times were tough. Love me some Manny Mua. Foreverrrrrrr 😩😩😩😩
Yesssssss!! Your makeup is slaying 🙌🏼💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 love you manny
I bet Manny Mua is having flashbacks right now hahaha
Loved this video !! 😁😁💖
Had fun watching you guys😂😂😂❤❤❤
Ok... am I the only one that in Halsey's outfit it reminded you of Katara's fire nation outfit from the last Airbender? 😅😅
Count how many times Manny touches his hair lol
Zendayas outfit was the best
You guys are a awesome team yall need to do more videos
Omg you left Jlo out ):
I hate when your videos are over. I could watch them all day. We def have the same taste in men! Love you babe!
I wanted more! Video too short haha
I love you and nick in videos together!!!
Harry looked like my GAAAAY AF BESTIE
Please do more of these!  I love these videos!
Really Manny? I disagree with you about James.  Because youtube paid for his ticket and someone else would have done the honor proud. I mean he's a child and tends to act that way. And Alexander, from the looks of it, wanted him to go with the first outfit, which was off the hook btw. LOL,  but nope he said "this one's so much more me" Its the Met gala!!  You're supposed to go with outrageous outfits. And Alexander also told him to wear a black eyeshadow look with it and he decided KKWs look fron last year was the way to go. Sorry dont mean to harp on it, but I was livid when youtube could've been represented by someone with a bit more life experience and honestly someone who's a big less full of himself . 😋
pierre from beauty and the beast
Your brother😍😍
Nick is 💦
Loved this and your makeup manny is sexy asaf
Gaga and Harry Styles were co-chairs of the gala this year.
Love how everyone's outfits are compared to Disney Movies💚💚
Pls do a tutorial on this eyeshadow!!
Nick literally exactly looks like the youngest Jonas brother!!
Stop touching your hair so much Manny XD
Thank you Manny!! People just hate on who ever everyone else is at the moment. I also feel a lot of people don't actually understand the Met Ball and how the designer chooses who and what the model  is wearing...
I love  zendaya with every fiber of my being🥰😍😘. Is it me or does nick look like ezra Miller? Also why didn't they show lily sihgns and Madison pestch outfit🤯
Manny is so nice ❤️
I really enjoyed this
I LOVE YOU GUYS TOGETHER
You didnt giggle. Who are you?!
When I saw “camp” I was thinking like hiking boots and hoodies... well outdoors lol
Makeup tutorial for this look? It’s amazing!
You’ll be there next year 🤞
Manny youre so gorgeous ohmygawd 🤤
I love you and your brother together !!
Travis Scott looks like GI Joe
The giggle is slowly but surely disappearing...  thank god 🤣
Cèline dion killed it
Lmao!! Boat challenge THE HOUSE!!!!
I love how nick checks himself out almost every minute hes so cute!! 🤭🤭🤭
YOU SKIPPED KACEY MUSGRAVES LOL WHY NO
“He looks like the Pharaoh from 300”. 😂😂😂 Xerxes was a Persian king; pharaohs are from Egypt. Just FYI. Cute video though. I also LOVED his look.
you eye look is awesome - tutorial please
wheres your giggle in the intro??
Definitely do more with your brother
Omg I wonder if James ran into Shawn Mendez 😀
I just really need to know what eyeshadow you're wearing!
why does nick look so little next to manny lol love you both
Please recreate Gaga’s look with the tinsel and diamonds. I wanna see
Manny recreate lady Gaga’s makeup look!!
I feel like Kim's outfit was beautiful, but I didn't feel like "camp". It just looked like a really well fitted and gorgeous dress. Maybe I don't quite understand the exacts of camp. Still amazing though, as always!
You forgot Maluma!!! Latinos in tha house!!
These outfits remind me of the Hunger Games
No tea about Kylie and Iggy wearing identical hair and dresses, just different colors?
Idk wtf Liza koshy was Wearing lmao....
“CAMP....CAMP....in terms of CAMP.....EPITOME OF CAMP. CAMP. CAMP. CAMP.”
U need a joint channel were u give a subscriber a make over (u for make up n ya bro for clothes).... If u do that once a month n then another video like this one etc xxx
Well, James did choose that outfit. He rejected the first dress that he tried, which was amazing but he went with that basic ass look 😒.
I literally forgot manny existed
GORRRRGA! 😂😂
your brother is too handsome 😄😊
the fact that you pulled this video the day after, I mean yaaas. You should've talk about the drags
Love this video, but set up is not enough. You need to do a straight up Jone Rivers tribute and do these reactions sitting in a coffee talk type setting next to a fire. Make this a series please!!! "CHAT AND CHIT WITH MANN AND NICK!!!" 🤩🤑🤯🔥🔥🔥
With Nick Jonas it probably one of those stick on mustache idk it don't look real ( don't hate me I love nick)
finally someone talks about halsey and how gorgeous she is
Sick duo of a great look
I absolutely loved this!
why is no one talking bout Bella Hadids outfit!! it was soo good.
I’m just trying to figure out Where James’ other nipple is @ 10:08 lol
Y’all vibe so well! Love any video with the two of you in them, but this was fun to watch.
Ok I loved this, this needs to be in the rotation.  Js
Manny that purple eye is slayyyeedddd
Not going to lie, I still don't understand what campy is
Cardi B’s dress look like a bathmat an oversized bathmat very absorbant bath mat 🤣
That purple eye look is everything!!
I think I know what  your brother was getting at with Kim K. The rain drops would have been better if they'd followed the less is more approach. I think it would have looked as realistic as her hair and skin.
Love this video def need to make more video like this!!!
MANNY PLEASE RECREATE GAGAS LOOK😍
i love a good toot and boot sesh!!!!
That eye look is everything.
Love youuu manny 💞
Your makeup was fleek Manny  omgg 💥💥💣💥💥💥💥💥💣💣💥💥💣💣💥💣💣💥💥💥💥💥💥💣💣💣💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💜
I freaking loved this video!
Lady gagas outfit was not my favorite I’m a big fan but it is my opinion
Let’s be honest: Cardi B looks like someone’s period, when you sneeze. That’s all I can think of when of when I see her.😂
I need a tutorial on this eyebrow look
how many epitomes of camp are there in this video
Priyanka looks like the good witch from wizard of oz
bruh but like have ypu seen the meme about nick being little finger from GOT omg so funnyyyy
haven’t even started the video and i’m like sooo excited for this 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Favorite part was Nick’s one ramen noodle hair.
Who's here to see their reaction to James' outfit?
Harry Styles looked gorgeous
Its nice that you did this video...really liked it
LOVE ❤️ you gotta KNOW your MEXICAN when you say...hate is a strong word 😂💕💕🦞🦞
WHAT ABOUT KENDALL JENNER!!!!!
tbh my opinion i hated james look . like it’s the met. THE MET GALA HONEY
i like how he said that katy perry looked like "pumiere" instead of  "lumiere" from beauty and the beast
Omg I love Kim Kardashians look when she's in video. I would have been awestruck if I was near her with the way she looked. It was so sexy! Liza Koshi did an interview for vogue with Kim and she was literally breathtaking! Her makeup was soooooo good and her body was glistening. At the end of the interview Liza was tongue tied and her breath was literally taken away.
Hate on alexander wang? The fact that he dressed him is a privilege
no connection but!!! can you do to your brother an intense black smoky eyes with a red lip. kinda pin up/ vampirella. idk why i just think it would suits him!!!!!
Ok so what does camp mean cuz when I think of camp I don’t think that’s what they mean😂
Manny, thank you for standing up for James and setting people straight in regards to the outfit James was placed in. It wasn’t my fav either but, dragging the hell out of someone    because of what they’re wearing is beyond harsh, it’s ridiculous. I loved yours and Nick take on the Met outfits, you both should do more videos together you play off each other really well.
Manny, you have Jlo gala makeup, why didnt u mention her!!! Omg, she kills
I honestly loved this, do more videos like this! 
I dont stay utd on the MG stuff, but this was totally interesting. And having both of you guys there to judge the outfits was way more entertaining than if it was just one persons opinion.
I love you manny! You so could of dissed James cause all he does is show is ass but you didn’t , the way he reacted to you’re Coachella outfit. So I can’t even. 🙄🙄 anyways I love you
Can we have a tutorial for Gaga's makeup look? ♡
What do they keep looking at? The view finder?
I swear one of them dropped a fart at 18:28 😂😂😂
Thank you for explaining what camp is. Cuz since yesterday I've been so f*ing confused. When I hear "camp", I imagine tents and fishing and boy scouts and (possibly) bears. So when I saw the outfits last night, I was like "these have nothing to do with camp". I am uncool like that 😂😂😂
Love the relationship y’all have! Literally mine and my sisters relationship lol and Manny you’re always so on point with the Disney references but the candles name is Lumiere! 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
I love their matching earrings
Please see deepika padukone at the MET she looked amazing
omg i'm glad your happy 😌
Halsey 😍😍😍
Until yesterday, I didn't realize how many people didn't know what "camp" meant in this sense. I thought it was just a universal knowledge for some reason, lmao.
This was a fun video. I love how close you and your brother are.
You should recreate some met gala makeup looks!
imagine giving harry an L as if he wasn’t king of the red carpet
Omg I love your eye makeup
Lady Gaga 😍😍😍
I don't get how he loved Katy Perry's look but thought Priyankas was tacky 🤦 Katy Perry literally was a chandelier 🙄🙄🙄
I’m not even done watching this video and I’m in love!!!!  Je’sus.  You guys nailed it.
I've watch so many of these videos and EVERYONE for got JLO!
Great video👍😎
His tongue action in the beginning😂💕
Emily Blunt was not camp.
🎯 Yes! We need a Manny & Nick channel!!!!! 💯
Actually, Alexander Wang wanted another outfit on James Charles (Which I think would've actually been perfect for the event), but he told Alexander Wang that he didn't like it so he ended up with that. So yeah, James Charles had a say in it, just watch the video when he visits him.
How many times can we count Manny running his hands through his hair?
Aww manny youre such a class act!!
Recreate Gaga’s look
Loved the video ❤️
When he says Camp was the theme i seriously thought he was talking about like camping and I was soooo confused and just like whatttt??? 😂😂😂😂😂
Well done, very impressed with you both and Manny you nailed camp 💜🎭💜
Take a shot every time Nick licks his lips 😂
You missed #iisuperwomanii or Lilly Singh among the youtubers at Met. :|
MANNNNYYY!!! YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT JLO'S LOOOK!!
Halsey looks STUNNING😍
Cara Delevingne wins for me.
love you and just a reminder Shawn Mendes it's more than stunning
I loved this video! We need more reward show fashion reviews. Manny and Nick do fashion police!
Living for this video
I really like James’ outfit without the little bandana. And Lizas hair was sickening.
What’s a met gala 😳 .. gn from Ontario Canada ... lmao nicks long curly hair in the end 😂😂 just that one piece, now he’s fitting in with the met gala,... with his hair being so crazy jk lol.. good nigh to u mwuahhh! 😏
Great video! You and your brother were awesome!  Loved the 9-5 comment...   ps what does the goat comment mean?
Omg your makeup ❤️😍❤️😍
Recreate Gaga’s look plz
Great job guys!
“This is camp for a straight man. For a gay it’s a 9-5” 😂
I love this vid but I'm a little sad you didn't do Lilly Singh
I'm surprised the very first guy didn't get more recognition in the media. Unless he did and I don't know about it. His wings and gold was so cool!!
Cant watch your videos while doing my makeup 😂 messed it up twice cracking up 🙉⚰️love you guys
recreate gaga’s look for a video lol
Manny I love you, and look at all of your videos, but on this video you really messed with your hair entirely too much. But I loved it and liked it because you are great and so are your brother.
And I saw LunarBeauty on Sephora girrlllllllllllllll get it
Travis's look is not new. I don't know what about the Soldier outfit that fascinates him, the last MET he was also dressed the same except black
Are we going to forget the cheeseburger????
Too many ads 😭😭
Please recreate the insane Gaga eyes just for shits and giggles!!!
Had so much fun watching this!
Joint channel, YESSSSSSSS!!!!
9:05 jenna marbles has left the chat
Umm this purple eye look though...yaassss!
What about Lilli and Cole???
10:23 THATS IT! THANK YOU MANNY!
Thank god the poor arent aloud the camp theme was off for me. Camping where with these outfits lmfaooo
JC Looks horrendous  sorry Manny call it like it is.
Harry looks like Johnny depp
I love your Yzma inspired makeup
Harry Styles: grandma goals
Is it just me? I see a greasy ham when I see Kim’s outfit!
THIIIISS LOOOKKKK 💕
Kim looks like a wet Publix bag but only she can pull it off
These family videos are so good!!
James actually did choose his outfit. In the clinic shows him turning down a much better outfit that fit the theme.
Loved this vid
Lumiere* 😂😂 but i got you! I got the same vibe!
i loveeeddd ittttt 😍😍nd i love uuu
dude recreate one of these looks!!
Recreate Gaga’s makeup 🗣!
You have to recreate some of the looks!!!!
make a video recreating Gaga’s makeup
Kim K was not camp !
Shawn & Harry looked ♥︎♥︎♥︎♥︎♥︎
I love youuuuuuuu ❤️
The boat challenge yes! Exactly what i thought when i first saw the outfit
Is he your brother or bf pls clear?
All I thought of was the Hunger Games capital.
U forgot deepika padukone the most beautiful
WE NEED MORE NICK AND YOU !!!!!!!!!
Yes the jade Leto outfit is Gucci and they had a runway show n all the models were holding their own head carcasses
i think nick loves jaden smith lmaoooo
I love you Manny, but did you mean Lumiere 😂😂 🕯 XOXO
MILEY WENT AS HANNAH MONTANA
Did I miss them reviewing lilly singh?
My husband on the right
Please do a tutorial on your eye look it’s bomb !
I’m actually so happy I subscribed to this channel
Either that guy is tiny or manny is huge lmao
You think I didn’t catch you say coherent instead of cohesive huh? 😂😂😂😂😂 I still love you so much though!!
Kim Kardashian was not camp.
I just love Nick so much
LOL! Nick was being critical AF about people not being on theme...I LIVE! I wish you could have told some people who attended this gala what "CAMP" means, Manny, because clearly some of them did NOT get the memo **cough**KarlieKloss**cough**. And BRAVO for discussing the make-up as well as the outfits. This was FUN!
You guys should've judged Darren Criss' outfit too!
I love the vibe you guys have. It’s so cute.
Someone made the best comment about Kylie and Kendall saying they look like a bag of Taki's lol
Is fanning your hair like a nervous twitch or something?? 😳
You and your brother are awesome together
I really would of loved to hear u guys opinion on Nikki Minaj, Ciara n Gabriella Unions outfits
You HAVE to recreate a couple of the looks, itd be fun to take a poll and let us pick which one's with our votes and it should be more than one look that you end up creating-at least 2 i think!👍
Love you manny ! ❤️
You should recreate your favorite looks and fix the looks you didn't like like Priyanka's.
I’m just here for the James Charles review🤣 I didn’t watch anything else. You were very mature and your words were well chosen and spoken. Bravo friend! 🌹 Be the bigger person😉❤️
This was super fun Manny!! I hated Katy Perry’s look and loved that Janelle Monae’s actually winked!!
Please recreate the GAGA look 😍😍
At what minute and second does her talk about James Charles outfit ? Lol I just wanna watch that part
You two should do reaction videos
Question, how do they sit down in these outfits? 🤔🤔😆😆
My top 3 were Billy Porter, Madelaine Petsch and Saoirse Ronan!
He saw the Harry Styles look earlier? But I thought he hasn’t seen the looks until now?!?
Your makeup is everything
loveeeee this
I wanted the reaction to Lilly Singh's dress😕
I love manny and nick and everyone but sometimes when I have bad days I just wanna rowdy someone sometimes you know
Recreate Gaga’s makeup look
Nick’s job in this video is to find what the outfit looks like
Shirt??
How are you not going to mention JLo?!
9:42 is what y’all came for. You’re welcome
They definitely can pick what outfit they’re gonna wear
I think what you meant to say about Katy Perry is "this is the epitome of lamp"
Recreate lady Gaga's makeup 😁
Love Love Love ❣❣❣
James Charles 9:40
I loved this video so much!!!
Pri's outfit is sick but idkwth the HMUA was thinking on this one. Too much.
pls recreate gaga's make up look
Does anyone else feel like Manny's brother likes him a lot more than what James Charles's brother likes him? Lol. James's brother just always seems annoyed with James but Manny's brother seems to genuinely like being around Manny and talking to him.
STOP LOOKING AT THE MONITOR
Best Dressed, hands down.....MALUMA
BUT LOVE THIS VIDEO
hey manny, i just wanna say that liza got 3 different outfits from her designer and she did get to chose hers
Hmm. Honestly haven’t watched one of your videos in a year or so. You speak so much campier now.  Interesting that as drag race becomes more popular, you speak campier
I liked the little sprinkles ☹️😂💕
Lumierre not Pierre 😂
please do a joint channel!!!!!!
Priyanka looks like the queen mixed with the mad hatter
Please do the “I let the person in front of me decide what I eat for 24 hours” IT WOULD BE SO FUNNY FOR YOU✨
Nick needs a fashion channel.
Wow u have 4 million Something subscribers and u still be adding the ads. 🙄people with 100 thousand sub don’t add this many ads.
“The boat challenge from drag race”. Hahahahaha ohhh goodness lmao hilarious 🙈❤️
finally someone explains that you dont dress yourself at the met !!
I kind of wonder why Timothee Chalamet hasn't been to the Met Gala. I think he would kill it.
Lol he touches his hair too much like annoying 💁🏻‍♀️
Kardashians/Jenner kill it every year
Oh wow he still makes videos thought he left that utube scene
Thise baby blue cowboy boots? 👀 hunnnny water thooose
can someone explain what the concept of “camp” is? cause i’m expecting to see people in boy scouts outfits and tent looking dresses and a campfire
I love your shirt Manny.  You need to wear it and do a review on Shayla's new palette.  xo
Ol you didnt mention the fact that katy perry copied Darien lake or paid homage to her wow
5:08 tHe hOUsE
loved this video
can someone explain to me what camp is
Very valid opinions!!
halsey yes!!
I just gotta say a little somethin' and it has nothing to do with the video..well maybe a small part of it.  I like that in all the screwed up, broken friendships on Youtube, in the beauty community, that you and Laura maintain a close relationship.  I have this feeling that Laura is there for you when others turn their backs.  That something to be valued!
This was such a fun video! Loved it!
Wish you guys would've reviewed Dua Lipa and Lily Collins. They were so campy and gorg and would've loved to hear your guys' opinions
why does he sound like all his words are connected without a space does he have a lisp?
Manny needs to do Halsey’s makeup
wow i love you manny
Makeup tutorial on your eye look.its sickening
Manny!! I agree with you on Lady Gaga! Your right about poor James, not his fault he got crapped on & ugly outfit. But Alex also dressed some lady & hers was boring in the House worse than JC!!
Good video. Do more.
I don’t like how on some outfits you don’t mention that it’s not camp... and it would’ve been better if you rated them 1-10!! Then they lost points for not being true to theme bc some people looked amazing but not camp some looked bad AND not camp
Whats up with all the straight men cross-dressing this year? Am I missing something?
Your brother tho.. 😩😛😋
tbh Pryanka looked a bit scary,  they went too far with the hair, not into the frizzy look but she's gorgeous no matter what but Katy Perry slays all the time lol , this is her element
LUMIERE, NOT PIERRE LOL
I came here just for the roasting. Hahahaha
Kylie is giving me lil Kim vibes
Love your purple eye makeup! Tutorial please 😍
I really really like this video!
Why does lady gaga look 50? Her body, her face, it’s weird.
Where was the laugh ??😢
These kinds of videos are so pretentious, I do like the disclaimer though. Still.
Absolutely loved it, please do more videos like this! I like that you're bringing Nick in too and his girlfriend was awesome in the half n' half makeup challenge! I'm not much much of a drinker but if people played a drinking game off of how many times you fluffed your hair they would be very drunk lol.
When I saw Kylie I was like I want that dress so bad like yes even with the wig
Loved thissss
You two are just soooo cute 😍😍
I liked the content is was a good review but next time I’d like not see keep referring to your phone for pics maybe have something in front of you  so your looking at your audience ahead just found it distracting watching you go through your phone like showing your friends holiday snaps didn’t feel inclusive to an audience
I love the comments by brothers!
I loveeeee u manny 💓💓💓💓
Damn you touch your hair a lot!!!
Gaga stole the show, who agrees?
PLEASE START A CHANNEL TOGETHER
Why Travis look like a ghost buster -.-
Love the brother videos I want more videos !!!! Love you guys !!!
My faces were Superwomans and James Charles
Lilly Collins tho tf
Uhmmm Nick’s curls are sooooooo cute! 🥰
I would go straight for Halsey and my love for her terrifies me as well... 😍😍😍
“She looks like she can be hung up in Nana’s living room” LMAO!!!!!!!
You guys are so good at reviewing outfits & makeup. Loved it! Loved that you had comparisons to other people... that was fun to see! 💜 (& Halsey...omg, didn't recognize her...she looked like a WOMAN, whereas normally, she looks cute & young!!!)
Nick knows his shiiii
I'M SORRY BUT KATY PERRY'S LOOK WAS TOO COSTUMEY!!! I love her tho!!
Egyptian realness
I loved Kim s outfit it’s stunning
That’s a lie they give you up to like 5 outfits bruh smh he picked it
Ezra Miller’s make up was done by @mimles on instagram. I’ve been following her for a couple years and her stuff is downright AMAZING! If you don’t know of her you should definitely check her out and maybe try to recreate one of her looks, it’d be a great challenge
9:41 for James Charles
Still not sure what camp is lol
its funny how you back up the youtubers saying its the designers fault because you know its bad, yet you didn't say that to the ones you didn't like
Love this video 💜
Can you review the new too faced multi use sculpting concealer? I heard it’s up there with tarte shape tape.
lmaoo that guy is so high
Side note here but Michael B. Jordan is one of the most beautiful men I’ve ever seen.
James Charles was a bit boring.. if i would do that costume, i would either use a TON of veil and lace as my headpiece (veil), , or a huge hat. like, overexaggerated - camp - cowboy ha OR Fedora.
Kim  K's second outfit, the blue latex with blue mid-calf boots and blue elbow gloves, should have been her pink carpet entrance outfit.  It was gorgeous.
I loved Lily collins look
Love videos but why donyouboull your hair so much. You are always pulling the top.
Love you Manny!!
You must must recreate Lady GaGas makeup 🤗
Manny’s little brother is fine as hell!
Can’t believe y’all didn’t talk about Kacey Musgraves 😍😍😍
recreate Gaga's make up pls
Honestly 2 comments
1. I’m so glad you explained that Kim was a “wet” look Bc I hated her fit and now I’m like ehhh okay I get it... I’m just an idiot  
2. ZENDAYA IS LIFE - you right!
why didn't u talk about lilly singh?
i feel bad for manny
What do you think about Superwoman's outfit and make up??
Hye where is deepika???
NICKI MINAJ!?
Is not that out of harry's comfort zone, look at his tour outfits, also, he always wears the rings and paints his nails, that's not new but the earring was something new
YOUR MAKEUP IS BOMB! 🔥✨🔥✨
I was just wondering what your favorite drink from Starbucks was!
How is cinderelly camp...
I am literally 🤬 about Taron Egerton. This is effing disrespectful.  He should have come in the Donalld Duck outfit or at least wore platforms and glasses. Was Elton John even there! Who is his publicist? #fightmebih
What does "Camp Theme" mean?
Before I move on did they rate Nicki Minaj..?!
Toot, Boot or Shoot! 😝
Love it&love you
You forgot zendaya
9:42 James Charles
Someone said KimK looks like a wet dirty bandaid 😂
You didn't see Lilly Singh? Shame.
#tittypiece
I loved Elle Fanning’s look
He didn’t bring up Kendall :(
Me for 5minutes straight thinking what Miley or where I saw this look before and I just realize HANNA MONTANA OMG 🤪🤪🔥❤️ is she trying to tell us something I mean the Jonas brothers came back 😊😊
You died in escape the night
The word is critique. Criticism. Criticize. Criticizing. Judgment moments.
WHERE IS THE GIGGGGGGLLLLE
Am I the only one wondering why James Charles was there...
🤯🤯🤯🤯
i really feel like cardi looks like a uterus
Oh my God. Is Manny Mua still alive? 😂😂. I thought he was dead for a very long time. Hahaha. He is still same shit, so whatever
💖
Did no one else realize that he said Katy Perry's look looked like "Peirre from beauty and the beast"? It's actually Lumiere.
They actually can say yes or no to a wardrobe
I sat here and agreed with it all.
I just noticed that the Greek goddess was available for sale on the Sephora website I just posted a review because I absolutely love the pallet and even though I did not buy it from there I purchased it directly from lunar beauty I hope they will publish it because I had nothing but good things to say about it and I’m so proud of Sephora for this and CONGRATS to both of you!
Harry styles😍
you do have a say on your outfit ...
You should be on E
I loved this!!!
LUMIERE! 😂
Zendaya just dressed up as Cinderella soooooo I don’t see how she killed it lol
Kim's was so good!
Kim K snapped. Next.
I love Kylie’s outfit
Suddenly we stan
MANNNYY HE DID CHOOSE IT
Sorry but just like James and Liza, aren’t they all wearing what designers picked for them?  I didn’t even know this event existed so bear with me on this one........👍🏼
congrats on your make up in sephora, that means a lot of prestige, not hype. and most important that the product delivers and is quality. you have the opportunity to grow and to be considered a serious brand, not a teenager brand you may want do some adjust to present you in the future as a more adult manny mua. longevity in the market is the key, no vulgarity, no fucking this, fucking that, you may want to take your audience to mature with you, not without you.
LUMIER!!! HA HA
Ezma vibes
I love these two
Pausing the video to defend my queen Priyanka Chopra Jonas for a bit. She said in an interview that her look was inspired by Louis XIV of France, who like, invented high fashion. So I don't think it pushes it into tacky when you're straight up bringing back 17th century France. Other than that, total agreement with all of your other assessments! Anyways, back to the video :)
HIS NAMES LUMIERE.
Your a friend of joey
Very glad you called out Priyanka’s look. People don’t understand that you can “be on theme” but still look super tacky and bad.
The first one reminds me of the goddess Isis
Pierre... you mean lumiere.
Lol just subscribed you are so funny
I love it because I love when you compare people to other things it's always so spot on and so funny. Plus you and your brother are so funny together. And it's kind of nice to have a break from the sit down get ready with me or the sit down new make up or the disperses that videos. So I say keep it up. Love you Manny
Jlo slays everyday
Nick Jonas looks like Littlefinger!!!!!!!!
All these outfits look like something people in the Capitol in Hungar games would wear!! Gagas makeup look is straight out of Hunger Games!!
looks like the high society in movie "The Hunger Games"
Make up on point
Whaaatttt?? No giggle???
For a straight guy this is camp, for a gay guy it’s 9 to 5......LOL!!!!!
Wow! These "looks" are completely impractical even in "high fashion" He was a Phoenix, please don't play oblivious to what the met gala is and what it is truly about. EDIT_ I wrote this before Cardi B popped up as a Phoenix ALSO! And the masks and the eyes all over the place?!? Mixed with all the black and white? Ears to hear and eyes to see are apparently in short order. Wake up guys.
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Nick looks like Bazzi to me for some reason anyone else?
Ughh missed the nikkiiiiii boushy boiiii.
Girl Celine Dion is only 51................,
If you could choose any designer to do James Charles' outfit next year, who would you choose?
i loved this all of it............
Cardi b looks like a damn period clot
I guess they never miss hun
Your grace should honor you an invitation to next years gala. James Charles could never.
Love this video
I LIVE
I'M SORRY BUT PRIYANKA LOOKED SO BOMB!!!
Its SO GORGA
😂
💕
Rihanna is QUEEN!!!!! Periodttttt👑
Lumiére****. Lol
Where is Deepika Padukon??
Listen, James absolutely chose that outfit. If you would watch his video Alexander Wang gave him at three choices, one of which was a trench coat dress type ensemble. That simple black trench coat was more Camp than a pack of paper clips. Now do I think Alexander Wayne cheetah James by giving him off the rack choices? Absolutely. Do I think that Alexander Wang embarrassed James Charles? Absolutely. But it was ultimately James Charles decision on what he wore.
make up tutorial on this look
Loved it!
harry is a king
Manny I love you to death but this type of video isn’t it sis... I’m so sad to see how your channel has no direction anymore. Get back to what we love about you which is reviewing products, creating looks. I’m miss your original content...
Have nick in more videos!!
PIERE?!?!??? LUMIERE!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!! Mannyyy
I loved this video!!!!!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
i wanna smash nick. bye
Why doesn't anyone mention Harry Styles' heels????
This might sound stupid but can someone explain to me what the theme “camp” means ? Like do they mean summer camp or what ???? Lmao
I saw your response to James Charles’s outfit in another video and had to come watch I thought it was so responsible and you’ve come so far you have definitely gained a lot of peoples respect out of this
I have watched you for a long time and adore you!  I have noticed that you have a hard time keeping your eyes off of yourself lately and it is just not my thing...it is time to depart company but best of luck to you!  You ROCK!
Pause it @14:27.    You’re welcome 😇
DRAG HIM
What does camp mean !?
First off. It’s lumière. Get it right.
Nick doesn't look completely uncomfortable at all.
You missed deepika padukone
is that his bf???
Queen
Who tf is pierre
Travel Scott is not the g.o.a.t...
Lumiere.
ILY Manny 💋  🧡❤️💛💜💙💚🖤
♥️♥️♥️♥️
“You could easily recreate this look” 
Everyone “manny recreate lady Gaga’s look” 
Manny : ugh pinche pendejo 
😂💀
who’s that with you
Umm, superwoman anybody?
10:23 PERIOD
Manny!!! I’m so upset right now!! First of all... GaGa was QUEEN as usual. But you didn’t do her justice!! You missed TWO of her outfits!! Ahhh!! She started with the huge pink dress then her entourage peeled that off her to reveal the black dress, THEN they peeled that off her to reveal another hot pink dress, AND THEN, they stripped that off her to reveal basically black lingerie!!! It was bomb!! She even did this whole thing with her crew & Sarah even touched up her makeup right there on the red carpet as part of her red carpet walk!! It was amazing!!
recreate gaga look\
Recreate james or kim’s makeup
Kasey Musgraves 😩😩😩💜💜
Rate!
Lumiere
Celine Dions dress yes !
To be honest, women get it so much easier cause they can just put a long, shiny dress and they get it but for men... if you are not gay and therefore uncomfortable with such extravagance, you just can't do it right... except for Cole Sprouse cause he is the epitome of irony
Where is nicki? She KILLED IT
I hate Liza and Katy Perrys looks so hard...
It absolutely blows my mind that anybody could ever see Kim Kardashian and want to look like her! She's a mutant! I would absolutely die if I had to spend even one day in that creepy body. Why do people do things like that to themselves??????
Ima be honest im not a stan of you but i appreciate you sticking up for James 🙏🏽
Ok Nick is low key shady I LIVE!!! lol ❤❤😍
I liked your guys’ opinions, but I realllly think that you didn’t take the theme into consideration with it. Like it was just purely a review of your guys’ personal fashion styles and I think it would’ve been cool to see you guys talk about how well things fit the theme along with what you think of their outfitss on a personal level!
Can’t believe y’all didn’t put Nicki Minaj in this 😩😩
Hi
So many products in the cosmetic industry are fueling child labour and slavery. Please be mindful of certain ingredients and maybe think twice before you buy something that you think just looks pretty cos it mighy have just cost someone their life.
“I think her body looks sickening.” Yeah me too, but in a bad way. All the surgery she’s had and the terrible influence she has on body image is sickening
🔮🔮🔮🔮🔮💜
Wasn’t Katy Perry a 🍔 ??!
Jenna marbles did the spider eye look first lol
I feel like wayyy too many of these celebs mixed up ‘camp’ with Halloween. Zendaya Katy & a few others look like they are just wearing left over costumes they didn’t wear from last October 😕
what about Ryan Murphy????
I’m sorry manny “ pier”. It’s lumiere
Nick is so right about Kim K. Her 'dress' is hideous. That color is the stuff of nightmares.
LOVE
Where's kacey musgraves ?
NO! Get back to the make-up videos
Let’s face it Harry’s outfit was blah
Yo vengo por Lizy :v
Ok cardi b was dope but she also looked like a vagina
Manny?!? What did you use for your eyes?! 😍😍😍
I love u manny 💜 Cardi definitely won the gala for me she slayed
Omg yess queen of hearts vibes 😂
Me:Seeing Manny Mua Vid Pop Up 
Me:Spams Link To All Of The Group Chats That I Have
Anybody think it’s crazy that my parents watched game of thrones for three weeks and now this week they are on season 8 :3
manny, when u gonna talk bout the outfits make sure they stay on the screen
There's your next video Manny, recreate s met Galla LEWK!!!! Lol 💋💕 👍
LOVE this content! ❤
How about recreating a met look voted for by your subscribers 💜
please, someone, educate me about the "camp" theme. I'm thinking like cabins in the woods and arts and crafts so I'm like hella confused lol
I found lewis Hamilton’s outfit sickeningg
Where tf was Nicki Minaj’s outfit tho Manny!!?? Jeez!
So funny keeping it real 🤣
Ezra Miller won the whole gala hands down idc
Love this!
Wish you would have reviewed Superwomans outfit
yeaas manny having james’ back, bruh the designer i forgot wtf his names is but james wanted to do a makeup look that i knooow would’ve been hella cute he wanted to do some black smokey and a paint splatter type on the other side since it’s called “campy” and that ugly ass designer said no :| like wtf that’s his thing is makeup tf. Tbh i wouldn’t had even went to it if i was in his position
They look like people dressed up in the hunger games
This was AMAZING!! I love reading the Met Gala looks and no one else gets it!!!! FUN FUN FUN!!!
If you’re gonna say that you can’t judge youtubers because they didn’t pick their outfits then don’t bash everyone else ¿
mugler went off on kim’s dress! best dressed, sheesh
LOVE THIS!!


Can I join you guys next time?
I like it. You 2 should do more videos together. 😁❤
Love the shadow😍! Tell us what you're wearing😀😁
I'm wondering if u were invited what would you have wore? XD
I wish you could have mentioned Nicki Minaj!!! She looked phenomenal 😭💕💕💕
Nick!!!! They’re married‼️‼️‼️
Quit touching your hair Manny 😳😳😳!!!!!
I’m confused I thought the pieces for James were pre purchased not that he was actually dressed by Alexander wang
Hahaha love it!!
priyanka is the worst one
Can we talk about iggy wearing the same dress as Kylie but here was like green and iggy was sent home?! Lol wtf sooo wrong!!
Love you manny !!!!
Manny doesn't deserve the hate he gets, he's done nothing wrong.
I wish you would move your monitor more beside your camera because in EVERY video, you look at the monitor more than you do the camera. It’s distracting!
Disney is like such a common theme im seeing in the outfits like they look like the cartoon characters lolol
Worst Katy Perry’s and fav Kylie and Kim K
YUSHHH
Such a fun video!!  Thanks :)
Lindo pibe eh
Taron's sprinkles are the dash of gay i wear around my parents
Love your makeup 😩💗 btw congrats Manny on being in Sephora ❤️🥳
@ 3:57 you say something that I would personally like to clock you on Mister Manuel MUA 😊✌🏽❤ jk but for real, try it!
I love your makeup look in this video!! ❤️❤️
I am loving all these uploads with Nick.
Manny + Nick collab channel? I'm waiting 😤
I loved this! Please make more videos like this! 😍😍😊
You need to get your other brother on the channel!!! Love you!!
You are by far my favorite YouTuber! You’re so real and the fact that you stopped and said something about James getting bashed super hard and everything is amazing. It really shows the kind of person you are. Which is awesome.
Loved this video!!!❤️😂
Please do a tutorial of this look😍
HARRY LOOKED BEAUTIFUL AS HELLL♥️♥️
I need you to recreate Lady Gaga's eye look stat!! It could be a new fun series of yours recreating celeberties met gala looks red carpet looks and editorial looks. Also love you , you have been inspiring me since forever and a day!
What is nick looking at to his left the whole time???
The gold god the first one he was the Egyptian goddess Isis
Where did you get those earrings?!!
taron does NOT equal elton, actors dont have to be the role they play in real life. People also comparing rami malek to freddie mercury and. These people are actors and they are not the roles they play, they are their own person
Omg no chuckle!!!
I LOVE Y’ALL
Great video
Even if you can’t pick your outfit, either do research on the designer(check if you like it) or you can always say no to actually wearing it(designers plus you should share a vision) you swear kim k is going to wear something she feels isn’t part of her vision even if the designer liked it foh
The Yzma reference.... omg. Lol.
Literally stopped what I was doing and immediately clicked your video. I absolutely love the bond that you and your brother have.☺️❤️
nick always looks SO uncomfortable on camera & it’s a real MOOD
I was literally in the middle of class when I got the notification. Clicked so quick
Omg please make a channel with him! You guys have the best dynamic. You truly seem happy and super genuine together
Enjoyed this video you should definitely do more videos with Nick! Also congratulations on your brand being sold at sephora!!!
Nick knows so much about high fashion woah impressed!!!!
LOVE THIS MANNY 💕
I love your eye look! So amazing!
IM LIVING FOR NICK’S COMMENTARY
This was super fun to watch and hear yours and Nick's opinions! Also, congratulations ON sephora!

You didn’t do Nicki? .... I’m so over you
I can always count on you Manny to give me the content that I need the DAY AFTER the Met Gala. 😍😍🙌
WHY DIDNT U LAUGH IN THE BEGINNING 🤧
“obv cuz he’s shawn mendes” lmaoo MEE💓

So we’re just gonna act like Darren Criss didn’t steal the show
Please do more videos like this!!! I loved it
Taron Egerton is so flippin hotttt. Yum. 🤗😭😅
Y’all are cute... Your brothers head looks sooo small next to yours 😂....
10:24 THANK YOU FOR SAYING IT IVE LITERALLY BEEN ARGUING WITH 187393 aPeople ON TWITTER WHO THINK JAMES LOOKS BAD OR SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN INVITED? I’m so glad you acknowledged it
I love what you said about James. Goes to show you are grown and mature. I don't know if there's beef between the two of you, but by the way he reacted on the video he did with Tana, it made me think there was.
I love this video but where was Ms.Minaj
Okay so I like this type of video!!!
I loved this 💕😊😊
What would manny and his brother no about fashion or think they can comment on fashion 🤣 when they both dress horrible and  have no dress sense 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hailey Bieber looked stunning
who else was waiting for superwoman :(
Love youuuuu
he did the look he did on nicks gf
No
I must be the only one who doesn’t like you but likes your content?
Love these type of videos had me crying laughing!!! 😂😂
I think you 2 should do this with every award show 🤣
Priyanka’s giving me Mad Hatter vibes 💯
Much love from London gorgeous 😘
Your makeuppppp🤩🤩🤩
Congrats on sephora❤️
all these outfits but my eyes were on the makeup look the whole time 😍
Ok babe ur judging peoples outfits but your coachella outfits were so boring sorry man😭
Yaaaaaaas another video with nick!!!
I’m dead the james charles outfit looked like a high class waiter outfit
I wonder how James is gonna react to this? And end of a fude?
Manny I love you!!! You say you’d go straight for Halsey and I always say I’d go lesbian for her😂 she is so sexy!😍
Shawn mendes is so cute
We all remember manis cochella outfit
These outfits are hunger games vibes lol
what does being a goat got to do with this lol. please educate
Manny I had SOOOOOOO much fun watching you two give your opinions on this! Luv ya. P.S. am I the only one who thought Queen Cardi B's dress was a vagina? Take a closer look when she's facing the camera. Crazy!
I hate priyanka look the most
Now thats how you deal with things in an adult, mature way, im liking you so much more in the last 8 months manny, you’ve grown and it shows! Now perhaps james could take a leaf from your book x
Gemma Chan KILLED it.
Bro Harry literally was living his best life
Loved the video you should do more of this.... Your brother was great 😁
Hey. Manny. You pronounce Egerton as Edge-erton lmao
saw your story and came INSTANTLY
Love your matching earrings 😎
Kendall Jenner was my favorite 😍
I like that you all did different people. Everyone else have been reviewing the same 7 people.
Did you see that guy with the theatre gown?? 🤤
Both of y’all 🥰🥰🥰 yesssssss!!
Look up Lena Waithe's outfit!! I wish I could hear your opinion on her's!
Omg mannys reaction when nick said it looked like wrapping paper 😭😂😂😂 love y’all ❤️❤️😭
Best: Katy perry, Cardi, Jenner sisters and HS
Jlo, thalia,,?
Reminds me of when my mom ties a knot on the curtain with the same curtain
Who else was waiting for gal gadot? 😐😐😐😐
What bout Keiynan Lonsdale? Iggy Azalea and Kylie Jenner wore same dress different colors. Lol. And what do you think of Ru and the Drag Race girls?
i also tried this one , and i make video come and watch my video on my channel 🙂
I love Katy Perry’s look❤️
I hate you.
I’m sorry .... no NICKI !?
YASSSSS content !!! lol I love your videos. I'd honestly watch you eat cereal lol
Literally nailed it!!!!
1 I really like the video and the fact that you did with your brother is really nice. 2 that eye look is EVERYTHING 😘
I love your makeup, Manny and it's so sickening!!!
You didn't talk about Darren Criss I'm-
Yes, spill the tea
You forgot Kendall Jenner my favorite one of the evening 😒
His name is Lumiere. Get it right! Lol she really does remind me of him. 😂
Yaaaaaassssss queeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnn 👑 👑😍 I needed my daily dose of Manny yaaaaaassssss queeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnn 👑 👑😍 💓
Priyanka definitely had Mad Hatter vibes frfr. I feel like if they'd had calmed down on her makeup she would have knocked it out of the park.
his head is so much smaller than yours lmaoooo love that
love youuuu!!!!💘💘
Gagas bow on this
Hahahhaha
James Charles is still not cancelled?... Why.. he literally copied Kim K makeup from Met Gala 2018 and the outfit... Why??is..hee there?!
When the met gala meets hunger games...
Manny thank you for defending James!
Y’all wrong about Kim k. She was the most stunning thing I’ve ever seen. Her outfit was so neat.
You left out the MOST BEAUTIFUL one which was KENDALL JENNER.    (not a fan - but she nailed the theme!)
I loved y’alls reviews! Y’all weren’t ugly and negative! It was fun light hearted and just honest it was great!
James Charles most certainly had a choice, he is the CEO of his company, the big boss who can hire and fire everyone. he chose to look like he is going to a bdsm sex party instead of a public party. he needs to mature up instead of acting like a child, he's 19 not 9.
Manny you are just everything!! I live for you and adore you and nicks relationship. You guys are hilarious!💗
Omg! I Love the video, you and your brother are so damn adorable!
This is my favorite video that you have with Nick
I was hoping you would do Maluma’s outfit. 😔
Ngl, kinda sad you didn’t include Lilly Singh. I really enjoyed this type of video though 💞💞
Best video EVER😂😂😂
Love u both u nailed it
I love when you make videos like these💜💜💜
Lady Gaga is the best
Ong love you the most
Congrats with launching your makeup line on sephora 🙌😌
Love this video!!
Katy Perry’s second look left me speechless though 🍔
Actually you do get to pick your outfit manny. Im a stylist and you work with the designer. Obviously to your aesthetic but its a collaborative work. Obviously this applies for couture looks. And james charles isn’t wearing couture thats just RTW. Like you can go online and buy everything on their own. Right now. Lol Couture isnt easy to get to. Idk why james charles was there.  But obviously wasnt on theme
I wanna know how Katy Perry sat down in that damn dress LOL
sharap
Very fun video
👌🏻👍🏻💫👑🙌🏻💫🖤😎😍😘😊😂😂😂💎✨💝❤️💗📱
The Gala - When celebrities believe they are royalty. More like a royal flush down the toilet...
The Harry Potter plug just made me want to watch your channel more. 😂
I clicked so fast! I love you Manny! Your brother is as amazing as you are! He should be in your videos more! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Your make up is AMAZING!!!
OMG that eyeshadow is perfect! 🤤
You are literally everything Manny! I love uuu 🖤
Omg Manny!! I am livingggggg for the purple eye!! 💜💜💜
Loved this!! Videos of you too are really great. Love a collab
I actually love Priyanka 😭💖

I live for mannys videos 💙
I live for mannys videos 💙

Mannys bro acting like he GAF about fashion for 20 straight minutes! Lol love it though. 😍😍😍
Next video should be you recreating met gala make up looks
You need to talk properly .😞
3:57 I’m sorry, my unskilled makeup skills doesn’t understand. Easy to recreate???? Maybe for u, but I cannot relate
Can we please  be besties?
Mannnnnyyyyyy!!!😘😘❤️❤️❤️
Curlzzzzzzzzz!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I thought James Charleston looked a bit of a twat tbh I also think he's a hypocrite I mean one min he slams transexuals in a video that hits the drama Chanel's, but dresses in women's clothes like 90% of time
My mouth L I T E R A L L Y dropped at Ezra's
"Oh. Hatred. Ok Nick, Hate is a strong word" 😂😂
Love watching you two together. Also, I ADORE your makeup look. Dang! 😍✨
This is like find your doppelganger CAMP EDITION
Loved this video!! & your eye makeup tho🔥😍
MBJ 😍❤  I'm loving that it's not a plain black suit
Love Curlz! Glad you have had him around lately!
Your my absolute favorite! ♥️ you!
I liked lots of these ✨🖤✨🌙
Of course I wanna see more of this videos!!! Love you!!! ♥️😘
Love this! Your head is so much bigger than Nicks 😂😂😂! And can you pls do a video on this look?? 😘
Thanks for gracing us with your presences 😁
Face: BEAT

I’m living for the purple 😍
i actually loved liza’s outfit but she just looked so awkward in the pictures ://
Anyone else getting a LittleFinger vibe from Nick Jonas?
I’m living for your purple eyes 👀
Can you do a look with a Juvia's Place eyeshadow palette?
When it came to James Charles you were very honest and didn't take the easy way out like he did on the Coachella  video on you. Thank you for being the bigger man.
sksks i didn't see lucy boynton :/
Awesome video! Would love to see more like this!
Where is Nicki Minaj?😐
Where’s Nicki Minaj??? Damn you manny :(
I don't think I ever clicked on a video this fast...it was amaaaazing😍...wish you would have commented on Deepika Padukone's look❤️
Uughh..I'm deceased!! They are living my dream life ...If I could I would walk around dressed like this everyday!! Please recreate GAGAs foiled gold eyes!!❤
Personally  I Think Kylie Won Met Gala Fashion ... Hair Makeup Outfit everythinggg
Oops I kinda forgot manny existed
Love love love this video!! Your makeup is so beautiful Manny! 🥰🥰🥰

MANNY! I am in love with your shirt 😍
queen manny drooping another quality video , both looking like a snaccc
Yeee I’ve been on a manny binge watch today now this😜
Thank you for explaining the theme to me i thought it was so weird 😆
THANK YOU for speaking on the James bashing, Manny. He doesn’t get to choose the outfit, point blank. People are so desperate to hate him without realizing he WAS invited and he did NOT choose the outfit or make it. You guys never talk or really acknowledge each other much if ever, so I really appreciate you taking the time out to say that.
The MET fell flat due to you not attending! You would have shutdown the show! 
You are the true definition of GOALS! Congrats on Sephora no one deserves it more! Love you!
Manny I live for you 😍😍😍😍😍
I loved this, kinda hoped you would talk about Lana Condor but I freaking loved this video. Also give us more if nick and his gf lol love them 🥰😂
I loved Nick and Priyanka's look
I think Gaga’s cute lol
So disappointed you never mentioned Lilly Singh. She was the best dressed Youtuber. She looked so stunning.
Yaaaaasss Manny I've been waiting all day for this video. Big thumbs up of course before I watch. Love u mean it!! TY for always making me lol😆❤️🙌🏼💄💋✌🏼️
Taron could've done so much more I was so sad when I saw his look 😂😭
Curly hair guy thinks Gaga has a "unique" face that he's not attracted to ...all the while he looks like Pee Wee Herman
Kind of early squad?😂🤟🏻
You're eye look in the beginning thouuuuugh. Straight fire! Love ya <3
Your makeup lewk is soooooo good😍🤩
Ok manny....👏🏻Youve gotttttt 👏🏻to re create 👏🏻lady gagas makeup look 👏🏻
Awww, Manny took James side! That's sooooo sweet! Love u Manny!
Yaaaaas queen👑💍👸💅✊
I like Kim's outfit but I feel she could've done a lot more with the fit. She looks hot but idk it wasn't a wow factor! Loved her makeup as always
I liveeeee, love this videoooo ❤️❤️❤️

HIT OR MISS I GUESS THEY NEVER MISS HUH
Ummm WHERE is the giggle though?😩
PLEASE RECREATE GAGA’S MAKEUP LOOK

It’s Lumiere from Beauty and The Beast. And Priyanka looked like the Mad Hatter, not the queen.
Liza did pick her outfit tho... and so did James
But really what was camp about gagas outfits except the first one ?
Thank you for explaining what "camp " means because I was so confused 😂😂💕
You and Nick have such a great relationship! Y’all are so funny. 💕 you both!

Is it just me or does Nick look like a Latino Justin Timberlake?🤔🧐
Manny you should do a video of you wearing acrylic nails at least for a week
18:49 “well you want those curls OR NOT” im dying at nick’s attempt💀😭
I can't believe someone jumped her and her mother-- WTH IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE LOL
nicks side isn’t bad besides the paint stroke of highlight😂
Haha she’s so funny and beautiful I like her 😄
she’s lowkey rude to nick
Nicks highlight...💀💀 looks lke he took a paintbrush to her face
Nick’s highlighter that literally gave her skull bones made me cough my orange juice up my nose... I’m dead 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 that part
she's being a tad rude to nick though.
he's trying his best
Your brother didn't do that bad of a job. I actually liked both sides. 😁😜
This is literally one of the best videos I’ve ever seen 🤣🤣🤣
Their relationship is literally my boyfriends and I 😂😂
"AINT NOBODY GUNNA TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT" --- i laughed out loud
She has natural beauty ❤️ reminds me of a Latina jacklyn hill ❤️❤️❤️💄💄💄💄
She’s so beautiful, and has such a perfect nose 😭😭
Nick did a good job!  BUT...Nobody does a better job than Manny!!!

I laughed so much at this video! Definitely do more videos with them!
I love how Nicks girlfriend is literally JUST like everyone is Manny’s family. Like she has the EXACT personality as everyone Manny, his mom, Nick and their dad. She just meshes SO perfect. And MAD props to Nick for being a good guy and NOT being scared of a single moms baby. That’s so good that he wasn’t scared of Axel or scared of getting into a relationship with her just bc she had a baby. Lol he should be more scared of her, she has SERIOUS badass personality (JOKING!!! About being scared of her).

My name is Amanda and I was like YES SING TO ME MANNY 😂👏🏼
Oh Kylanie is a great sport cause Nick went full ham on her beautiful face.

But the way they speak to each other is how my Tia & Tio who are funny AF and secretly lovey dovey talk to each other in front of people. Just snapping on each other.
"Wrinkle in time that ass" had me DEAD. I loved this so hard. Kylani is STUNNING. She is naturally so gorgeous and the makeup just accentuated her beauty more! Loved this video. I laughed the whole time!!! Great idea♡
Love her! Hope she's on your channel again soon :)
Omg this is probably by far one of my FAVORITE videos of yours💛she is absolutely stunning and just the connection between nick and her is AMAZING and how you treat her like she’s your sister is the cutest!!
You should let her glam you!! 😋

wonder how manny felt about daisy when she was dating his brother🤔
Ohhmygod I love how down-to-earth she is and HER HUMOR YAS I LOVE
Imagine doing his new girlfriends makeup with his ex girlfriends palette 🎨 🤣🤣👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 I just bought the palette, it’s cute or whatever lol
They are so funny together 😭🤣💀
I really enjoyed this video all three of y'all have very good chemistry together
First of all her skin is beautiful and she’s so pretty!
She is so freaking gorgeous. My eyes were all on her from the beginning of the video. But I think I'd be intimidated of her in person 😂 shes a whole lot of personality (not a negative thing) I'm just a timid/shy person.
Didn’t he date daisy Marquez??
Omg she turned to her right and I was BLINDED! 🤣🤣😂😂😂




OMG MANNY LOVED MY COMMENT! I can die happy now.
She has natural beauty! I love her personality and I just met her here rn 😂💗💗 I’m so happy for your brother, total upgrade love

She’s being Manny so bad😂
Can I please make a suggestion! Move your monitor either above or below your camera.. All y'all do is look to it and not at "us". Kinda feels like we are in a group and we're being ignored and just standing there. Love your videos, just the only thing that bothers me!
So much shade between her & Nick you three are so fun together. OMG I am laughing so hard
Please do a video with Daisy!
Nick’s highlighter is giving me life
She is like Manny but an actual woman 😃 she is gorgeous! Love you guys ❤️

Lmao you need to keep her on your channel! I love her!!
You should have axe do your makeup
She kinda mean but i like her 💀😂
I had this playing in my background kinda offputting how her joking just sounds like shes bitching the whole time. Sounds very condescending and rude.
2:01 LMAOO love them

She reminds me of Rosa Diaz from  B99, just the version that smiles and laughs. Anyone agree ?

Many slayed

ya'll are so fine!
Love u manny!
Omg I love this vid I mean I love all of us vids Manny but I love that u get to see Nick and his gr in this vid she is so pretty and down to earth and the fact that she was a single mummy and Nick still took on that responsibility is detest the most amazing thing in the world I'm a single mummy to 3 kiddies its a huge thing for a person to take on someone else's kids regardless if the other parent is still in the child's life so a big shout out to Nick for being there and to u for also taking on little Axel as part of ur family to you all should be very proud that's what family is at the end of the day DNA doesn't mean everything
Ngl daisy was better

daisy has entered the chat...
I’m friggin cackling
Your brother and his girlfriend are so cute and sweet! They're lucky to have found each other. I am not so lucky. I don't need a man to step up as a Step-Dad, my kids have a Dad, I just need a man who's trustworthy around children. Honestly, besides my brothers and my kid's Dad and his Dad, there are about 0 men I trust around my kids.
She sounds and looks like a he!
She kinda rude to nick
Before I enter the video I thought she was huda beauty she looked like her in the photo I'm I crazy? 😥
nick is always licking his lips lmaoo
😍😍😍😍😍😍
sorry i dont think shes the right girl for curlz but thats just me*
omg i died this was sofunny
Moouuuuuuuum. Not right now lol
What’s under nicks hat? It’s huge lmao
So cute!! I love her!
She looks like Kim Kardashian a little bit :)
She’s way prettier than daisy
Why is she me lmao
She looks like RACHHLOVES in dark hair version heheheh
I love her she is so funny
Nicks girl is so funny !!!!! Love her
<3
NickMUA
she kinda rude LOL
They should make a youtube channel
Shes sooooo pretty
I really like her she’s so funny
MANNY ONE
Wow mannys side looks fire
why when she turns her head to mannys side she looks like jacklyn hill or however you spell her name lmao
So, I do like her. & it succccks that nick is no longer single. But I’m kind of hoping she doesn’t talk to nick like that all of the time. She seems like she’s really not feeling him too much. 😕 loving her besides that though!
The difference between her personality and Daisy’s is sooo crazy! She seems so down to earth
She’s hilarious and she’s a mommy I’m in I’m here for thissss
Wow she’s kinda rude...
What is a simpleton
Something i've found easy when doing peoples makeup is practicing using your non-dominant hand. Like I'm left handed so i can do the right side person facing me's face, but i use to not be able to do the other sided with my right hand. I still can't do eyebrows or liner with my right hand but like eyeshadow and base makeup i can do. It really comes in handy to practice that.
daisy never even got the chance to be in a video with manny & nick together lol that’s crazy so him having his brothers new girl on his channel must mean A LOT
I like daisy better 😳
How does nick not know the Amanda show?? I’m 22 and I was obsessed
She looks old
I LOVVEEE HER
So funny😂😂😂😂
Nick is a Mexican Justin Timberlake
Sorry, but the girlfriend's attitude ruined the fun of this video.
She’s so beautiful 😍 Nick did a little something on his side too, don’t beat him down 😂
I love this😂❤️
Nicks honestly really cute
😘❤😍
She kinda sounds like a trans like she is trying to make her voice higher idk just me ??
She kinda looks like Kali Uchis amirite?
Omg... the end of the video when they do that little dance.. what show or movie is that from.... it's going to bug me.. I saw it recently...... damn it! Help!
Oh?
I HATE NICK. Lmaooooooo “what if I lick it” “it’s called blending” I CANNOT lmaoooo
DAISY MARQUEZ IS THAT YOU
I’m groot... 😂😂😂
Seems like she doesn’t like nick... like at all lmao
she kinda looks like olivia munn!
Kylanis is so beautiful Fr like without makeup she look like a goddess!!! Those freckles I’m jelly
She kind of looks like Olivia Munn
Like if manny should do the frozen makeup challenge!
She's so rude
LOVE

Heyyyy follow me pleaseee @kiwa_671 on insta
Please like my comment love u so muchhhh
OMG FIRST COMMENT!!!!! Love you Manny!!!!!
Shout out please
Love you manny!!!!
You need to come to Dallas!!!!
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT QUOTE SHE GAVE ME?!?!?!? MAM..... what the hell
The comment asking for Manny to review the MAGIC STAR CONCEALER wins the internet today!
For 7000 dollars, those blinds better clean my house, improve my credit score, and cure my depression.
do a review oh the kybrows
Damnit manny I JUST went to Sephora on Sunday. grabs car keys .
Every time I watch your videos my boyfriend thinks I'm talking. He always says "You two talk exactly alike, act exactly alike. You are Manny, Manny is you." And I don't care what anyone says, but that's a whole compliment, hunty. 😂❤
I went into ENDGAME feeling happy and excited and came out sad and thinking about life! 😂😢
Damn!!! Check out your stomach!! All your hard work is definitely paying off! ❤👍👍
My Muffin 7000 for blinds? OMG!!  Hell I would have to install them myself!! Love the look... you are snatched!!
Review the kylie jenner brow kit please
$7000 !!! Hell No you can get blinds at Walmart for $10 each lol
Love this video btw you have to let your lash primer dry😂❤️
I was really expecting to see the Magic Star Concealer and then it hit me... 😳 Yeah, that’s  not going to happen lol.
“They glided, they glid? They glued?” 

Why aren’t we best friends yet! Lol
Every time I hear someone say A Muck my brain immediately goes to the movie Hocus Pocus! Where Sara Jessica Parker jumps up and down singing A muck! A muck! A muck! A muck! 🎶.....lol! 🧙🏻‍♀️
My two year old son always comes over when he hears your voice and gives you kisses and says hi lol.  Its so damn cute.
Me: lives a beautiful happy life "Everything is fine." :)
Manny: "AVENGERS ENDGAME"
Me: "Life is worthless, we're all gonna die anyways. Oxygen is a scam. Global warming is here."
I just died! 😂😂😂 I lived for the dance with the song! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻😘😘😘😘😘
Manny struggling with the word glided/glid is ME 😂❤
Omg queeeen 😩💜💜😩love you!!! Pr skin care products coming soon?
Every time Manny says: “Gorga” I die😂😩❤️
Sure losery could be a word...😂 Avengers? Yeah no shame I cried...that bronzer is gorgeous! (can you mention prices or put them on the screen?)the eye color combo is beautiful
I can’t address enough how much I love him 😩😍😹
I'm a bad BIETCH so Ive BEEN SUBSCRIBED! 😍💜 LOVE YOU MANNY ! 🌙
Baby! Go to Home Depot or Lowe's and ask them for the blind quote. $7,000 for basic blinds oh my God. Your dad's pretty handy right? He did like a lot of stuff on your last house? Can Papa install the blinds? Like $7,000 maybe if they were the ones that came out of the ceiling and like with the push of a button! but not for no basic ass ones!
Omgggg hi Manny I love you and you channel so much!!!! I've been watching you since day one 😘😘😘
You have to try a video with mexican brands! Sorry for my inglish, i'm from mexico and i love your videos!
OMG I love you Manny!❤️❤️ I'm 😂😂😂 I can't get enough of your videos! BTW $7000 for blinds umm is she nutz!?
I love you and love your personality, you always make me laugh and make my day better.
Love from Yemen ♥️💋
Forget about Tom Ford and La Mer. I would literally die to have those colourpop liners. 😩
This is literally my FAVORITE eye look that you've ever done. Gorgeous!!!
Omg i just loooove how extra Manny is!  Is literally my spirit animal! 😂♥️
I just got your moon prism highlighters manny :) they’re very nice :D 💕
“That early squad” 😑😑 y’all can suck it! Lol jk! Love you manny!
Here's what you were looking for Manny- Apply primer then mascara to one eye at a time before the primer dries. Add two coats of primer for more impact. Place brush at base of lashes and gently sweep up to tip. Love You!!
The lash primer just helps the mascara stick & stay on longer babe!♡ you don't have to wait though
Best blush on you looks great also love blush honey Lowe’s got good blinds lol 😂
Your background is EVERYTHING.
If I’m being honest I think maybe lash primer is a gimmick lol 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ but love that eye look 🔥🙌
One of my fav make up loooks omg!!!! ❤😍
I'm back and the brows are fiiiilled, okay yes.. I was singing along!!
Great video, as always! I had the same reaction when I watched Avengers Endgame...lol.
You too funny! Please do a furnished house 🏡 tour when your ready!!! The natural light is sickening! Losery my new word 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 love your guts manny! You look stunting 🖤🖤🖤

Oh. My.  God. . I fuckin LOVE Cadbury eggs! I bought a pack and didn't let anyone in my house touch them.  They're so bomb and addicting. 😍😘

I just love you so much, your videos always make me laugh and smile. Love the new brow song ha ha much love

Hey Manny. Could you please disclose which products are PR, you bought yourself or are sponsored? Maybe similar to Nikkie‘s new icons disclosing what is what.
Manny trying to do a kick with his leg and failing hard af is me everyday when i try to do a bomb af eyeliner ☠️ #mood

Manny, I thought the lip was GORGEOUS. It was like your perfect nude, just amplified...IDK, maybe it looks “blue” in person but I didn’t see it, lol. Also, the skin was snatched. ♥️♥️

Girl living for the background 💚💚
Omg I've been saying "Get" more now bc of Manny <3
I love you sm Manny you're so adorable 😂😂🖤🖤
I was just going to say the background is beautiful!!
Fenty, yess,  need to buy & try, and loosery - new word for growing losers? 🤔 & $7,000 for 4 sets of blinds? (Guessing) my god find a YouTuber or ask  Mr Kate or someone like that that is insane if they designer sure, i would have no filter and tell her straight if she's being rude to her customers! 🙄
Omg manny. Can we be best friends in real life?? ❤️❤️❤️
I really like the Marc Jacobs concealer and the blush 💖💖💖 looking flawless manny mua. Thx for the review I’m so getting these two products
"Yes, period the end over"
Thank you manny that’s LITERALLY THE POINT OF PR
Amazing video as always, thank you Manny for all the joy you bring into my life, every day. Hard times will pass and you will get through this. I love you and will always do!
"Highway attempt of robbery" hahaha had me rolling! Love you Manny :)
yaaayyy lived when that evil giggle appeared hahaha love you so much💓💓💓💜

“IM BACK AND THE BROWS ARE FILLED” X1000 lmao I liveeee with this video!!! Love you Manny!!!!!!!

"GIT". "It never have glid so good" 😂 I LOVE you. Also, Raye's first palette with BH was crazy pigmented and good too. I wanna pick up this second one.
Ok Manny, so I love you so much that I just watched a whole 4 minute ad to give you some extra 💄 💰 babe! 💕
I met you at my job, buffalo wild wings, wearing this makeup look ❤️❤️ I fan girled sooo hard i’m sorryyy but I love you ahhh!!!
I always love a long video from Manny 🌙💗
I love how Lushious Massacr lingo peeks through you sometimes lmaooooo
Omg i recently started watching your videos and i'm in love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You’re a win 👏🏼👏🏼❤️ love love this!!!
Can you test out the Becky G x Colourpop collaboration??? Pleaseeeee!. 😁🤗
You should always apply mascara right after lash primer 😬 you don’t want it to dry and they your mascara will clump! Lancome CXLs booster is the best 💁🏼‍♀️
Manny I love you BUT the back ground music is driving me crazy. Like when it peaks it's has this echo effect that sounds like a phone ringing in the back ground.  Like I kept looking around like is it the video? It is I asked someone else. Either way I loved the video. 😘
Just discovered you a few days ago 😂 I feel like i've been missing out for so long lmao.
Can you try the Smashbox pallet later? I love those and they are criminally underrated.
I love how you post around lunch time so i have time to watch your videos on my lunch 😂❤️
OMG can’t believe that no one has acknowledged that Manny definitely HIT THAT WOAH in the beginning 🤣💃💓💓
Damn, you is Beautiful! 😍😉
I'm loving the background! Good job manny!

This set up/ background is much better. Giving me ethereal vibes😘👍🏼
$7K for what? Those had better be the best basic blinds in the world. self adjusting or something, and why go to a potential clients home with a cranky attitude? Way to win accounts. I usually love the eye looks you do and this one was just so pretty. Thanks for your reviews, I appreciate it. 🤗❤
The sound effects from the fan 😂😂 I watched that bit like 3 times
Hey boo 😘 As always loved this 👏🏻 SIDENOTE:- I watched your tjmaxx video the other day when you got the Anastasia blush trio so I went to tkmaxx today (as I live in the uk🇬🇧) and they had it🎉🎉 got it for £12.99! Thanks for mentioning it so glad I managed to get one! Xxx
Hey manny Happy Thursday 😉 hope your having a great Day😉
You are by far the most hilarious YouTuber EVERRRRR!!! 😂 I love you manny!! ❤️
Love your videos. You seem more excited since you moved. Love the positive attitude.  Amazing look. Love it all
$7,000 for blinds 😮?! You could buy a decent used car for that! Maybe you could sponsor/ pay a local sewing group to make them for you.
Omg those lashes are so beautiful. Your eyes look stunning. I would probably use a bold berry lip color with that look 😁
I wear a lash primer so my mascara doesn't smudge (I'm oily) :)
Who clicked so freakin fast & went straight to the comments !?? 🤣🙋🏽‍♀️ 




Btw I’m also Youtuber, I would love any support! ❤️
I was so excited to see a new video you always make me laugh 😍
Honestly, this was 100% worth waking up at 5am to watch. Love you so much!
I love how your lower lash line matches your shirt lol
you crack me up.  just made my saturday! 😀
Your reaction the the highlighter mist and the way you looked at the fan was great 😂😂
I live for your bloopers/out takes Lol you need to make a video of just those 👍😁
Reaaaaally waiting on a new house tour 👀 background looks so cute
I love your back ground. It looks so pretty.

Ps I’m a new YouTuber 👀💕
He said it was a morphe lip
Liner and in the picture he added it was an Ofra lip liner 😂
The Marc jacobs lash primer is so good! I was like how can this be worth this price? Its just lash primer...but .. BUT IT IS!
"but why are they so good? its not my fault that theyre so bomb😐"🤣
Love your videos, stay for the bloopers😂💜
Just woke up from my nap to be blessed by this video ♥️ thank you 😭😂

Checked out my channel!)
I have watched this video like 4 times! I love you! you crack me up...the house!
Manny when is Lunar beauty coming out with blush? I know you will knock it out the park. <3
I like to put lash primer before I do my eye look so the lash primer can settle before mascara. It works better that way.
Living for this look 💋💋💋 try red aspen brand. ❤️❤️
WHO ELSE NEVER MISSES A VIDEO?! 😍

Ps: if any kind soul has any time, I’m so close to 11.5k 🙊
I love how in the bloopers it casually plays elevator music lol

I've never understood how the lash primers work either lol love the look 👀❤️👌
Slay all day 👑
That shirt is so cute, Manny! I love that colour on you!!
definetely let the eye primer dry before putting mascara. It'll dry to clear that's when you know it's done :)
I need the "I'm confushhoonn" in gif form PLEASE
I just want to tell you Manny keep it up I love the fact you post soooo frequently love that I finish a video I’m already waiting for another don’t give up continue posting every week 😭😭🤩 love u manny babe❣️

You are so funny where have you been all my life?? It honestly took me too long to get around watching one of your videos
When I watch Manny video's it puts me in THE BEST mood <3
The blush and the palette DAMN. But the quote tho 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Been watching since day one and subscribed ever since love u boo
Im loving the lip color !
That’s the best looking bronzer I’ve seen on your skin tone! It doesn’t have the orangey tint like some bronzers have! You look amazing 😘😘
I agree with you on the Cadbury eggs they are bomb!!
i gave thumbs up cz you watched endgame <3
When you started clapping I died in class 😂😂 I do the exact same thing all the time and I can't stop
Mannnn Endgame had me a mess😱😭😫. Why’d they do that!??
Manny, where did you get your back ground decor?? I’m looking for golden toned decor for my living room and those are sooo cute 🥰
I love the new background!!
Cadbury’s are life. 🥰🥰🥰💪🏼
you def have to let the primer dry,  the lip is awesome
1 pm is early for you??? 🤔🤔 geeez
That Patrick Ta?! Omg I need that
He did that with the eye makeup look!! Yass. And that bronzer is gorg!!
Manny you're probably breaking out from the Milk Hydro Grip Primer..Ive heard ALOT of people say they love it but it breaks them out something fierce..maybe thats why??
I just have to tell you how much I love you! 💕 it’s 6:20a...and I’ve been masking and watching you since 5:30a...yes PMS demon, you suck BUT MANNY I LOVES YOU!!! 😍😍😍
I think the look came out really pretty❤
I’m like 4 minutes in and I’m cracking up LOL!! I freakin love you 😂😂😂😂😂
I was having such a bad day until I watched you! You turned a terrible day into a good one so thank you and love you Manny❤️✨
Love i freaking was balling balling like a baby! i went alone and the family sitting next to me i caught them looking at me, my natural reaction was "what!" they probably thought i was some crazy trick! lol love you manny! your the best youtuber of all the lands and kingdoms! haha
From my experience with eyelash primer you put the mascara on right after before it dries. Suppose to help your lashes spread out better and wash off easier with out being so harsh on your eyelashes.
love you ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
I always feel as if I have to giggle every time you giggle, it's so contagious :D
Makeup looks bomb af 🔥 hot 🔥 ilove that yellow on you. 💋 💖
Like bad bunny with the nails. 😂
Love it! Especially the liner!!
I've never laughed soo much 😂😂😂 Singing, "I'm back and the brows are filled!"
I think your my favorite.....LOVE
You look amazing👍👍👍👍👍👍
omg the night king in the beginning im CRYING love ya
Manny- please do an Avon “Avon calling” review!!! No one has and I’d love your opinion
"Get out before I call the police" lmao 😂
for lash primers you're usually supposed to put the primer on, let it dry and then curl your lashes again and then put the mascara on. It works a lot better.
I love you 3000 manny❤️🤖
The eye look is EVERYTHING!!!
Omg Im obsessed wit you 😍😍 get it boo
The lip liner had ofra on it not morphe or am i seeing things? X
Fave laugh intro of all time! Love you manny!
$7000?! That’s ridiculous!  She tried it!! 
A lot of people are saying that MILK Gripping Primer breaks them out.  Just a heads up on that. 
Love you Manny  🌙        #MANNYAC
Im LAUGHING OUT LOUD FOR THAT intro GOT hahahahahahaha
I seriously LIVEEEEE for your videos ❤️
I love itsmyrayeraye palette. It has become my everyday go to pallet
$7,000 for blinds and a bad attitude..get out..that’s insulting!!😱😳🤭  Loving this entire look though..GORGEOUS!!🤩🤤😍  Another awesome video!!  Love you SO SO SOOOOOO much, Manny!!💖😘 xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo 🌙🌙
Omg endgame had me sobbing. And bad bunny was the baddest bitch with those green nails
Omg avengers end game!! 😭😭😭 never have a cried so much in a movie best movie honestly amazing!!
Shocked you weren't sold on the kush mascara, I loveeee it!!!
your edits kill me lmaooo 😂😭😭
Many the lighting of the video was great with the natural light coming in!
Yeah you need to put on way more lash primer than that to see a difference it literally will build up your lashes. Just like mascara really.
You are my literal favorite ❤
That highlighter tho! 😍😍😍😍 love you Manny!
The night king face in the intro was the best thing ever 😂😂😂
Beauty room/makeup tour please!! Hercules  Hercules!
I absolutely love you🥰😍😘❤️
Oh my god that spray highlighter 😍
A vid I'd die to see would be you trying products and not knowing what they are. Like have someone else scoop the product out or cover the packaging to where you couldn't tell what it was/what brand it was, I'd love to see your reactions to that lmao
I love this look and you 😊
Anyone else go to his brothers IG to see how his GF looks? 👀🙈😅 No??? Just me 💀💀💀

IG prowdmommyof2
That highlight spray made it look like you got clocked in the eye.  Are you kidding me with you loving that?
I bought ur highlighter VENUS and loved it
That looks like a million dollar beat. A gorgeous look like your full face Tilbury tutorial.
I love the way the liner looks!! I usually don't really like coloured eyeliner but it looks so good
a lash primer can make your mascara stay longer and more resistant to water, smudging, etc
Gorgaaaaaaa where’s your May boxycharm video?! @mannymua
Dudeeee. I will fly out there and go get blinds and install them for you my dang self for under 7k 😂
“Get out before i call the police” 🤣🤣

I’m not gonna lie I love the natural lighting in the beauty room! I dont know why but it makes everything look so beautiful
Beautiful Thank you for Sharing Beautiful
The best thing you can do to save a ton of money is hire a  handyman to measure what Windows you want blinds on.. go to  home Depot pick blinds and they will cut them to size right there..
Handyman can install them 😃
Being rude as hell then over charging? No thank you !
Your videos give me life 🤣
I liiiiive for these videos and I love you Zadddddy 💜
For lash primer you should let it dry all the way
I LOVE U MANNY, I DONT SPEAK ENGLISH BUT FOR YOU I TRY! <3

Im going to say it again I am loving the person you have become, i feel like you have opened up so much more instead of being "uptight" and i dont care for that word but i don't know how else to say it... ❤❤ i enjoy the videos you have put up in the last few months verses years prior
I have tried and liked a few black tinted lash primer. I think it is by Maybelline believe it or not...it was a conditioning type formula. But a lot of mascaras are formulated so much better now
You are adorable! I love watching you.
i laugh too much for this video😂😂😂😂
Bad Bunny with the nails 😂😍
I love watching ur videos.. there such a breathe of fresh air... ❤❤❤
Baby, Go down to Lowe’s or Home Depot. $7000 is ridiculous. I have blinds with no cords and they will install them for you. No need to be bouje about something like that.

I still use the Hoola bronzer based on one of your old videos. It seriously is perfect for me.
I never get bored of your videos literally you the best!!!!
Every single time someone says Hercules I think of that scene from the movie😂
Idk what it is but you took your "hiatus" and you've come back BETTER THAN EVER!!!! Loving your content so much
Manny!! ❤️ you kill me 🤣
I just bought that hydro cbd primer I’m so excited to try it
Same I cried while watching the endgame
Still looking good, as always

Am I the only one who thinks Manny is like a mix of Robert scienna and Michael Eddie from cheerleaders?😂
Your eyelook is stunning!
I'm back and the brows are filled! #dead 💀⚰️🥀😂
I don’t like the cover fx blush on you ... too intense too pigmented.
I saw Endgame twice and I cried twice....... Manny help me
To me that lip color went perfect with your shirt
Manny being relatable for 25 minutes straight.
You better get your cute ass to Lowell’s or Home Depot and get some yourself. Super easy to install! Oooh and make a video of it!
Can you please do a video with all KylirCosmetic products? (Concealer, foundation, setting powder, finishing powder, eyebrows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, blush, contour, highlighter, and setting spray). I want to know from someone completely unbiased (aka. you) who will give an honest opinion on her products. I’ve only ever gotten her lip colors, eyeshadows, and highlighters but I want to know if anything else she made is worth it. Thanks Manny! We love you!
Cover my body in the highlight spray
dude endgame was so gooooood.
Literally lost it when you hurt yourself.... you slay me constantly. #notboring
I am living for this eye look!!
i cried niagara falls during endgame
HERCULES HERCULES!!!❤🤣👏👏

I CRIED TOO 😭 at the end of avengers end game LOL!!!
Ok that Bee eye tee see H( how do you spell h?? aycuh? 😂) is straight crazy for that quote. BUT, I love your backdrop with those windows now!!  
I'm gonna have to try that fenty bronzer bc I'm so effing pale..I mean beautifully fair.

I love you manny so much ❤️
I’ve never been so stoked and interested in make up before! Your personality is captivating and enthusiasm is contagious! Not to mention how adorable and witty you are! My new fav channel! Keep up the incredible work! Infinite stars!
I’m terrified of doing my own makeup 😭 if only he owned his own store here in Toronto 😩😩😩 I’d go there all the time lol
That Norbit reference killed me hahahahaha
Yea! Another great video from Manny!!
The laugh today, lol, sounded like Tim Curry for a moment. :) And I ugly sob cried during Endgame.
Why is there such a thing as eyelash primer???? Idk anyone that has trouble with their mascara wearing off after a few hours and my God the waterproof mascara, you can have one of those sweaty nights out at the club dancing around go home dance around a Lil bit more in the sheets and get up the next morning and everything is gone except your waterproof mascara...😂😂  you can't get that off without 2 or 3   makeup remover wipes....lol good luck getting it off if you use the primer.....😂😂 Great video Manny 😜 oh ya and $7000.00 for blinds 😶 too bad you can't say who quoted you because that sounds like she was wanting you to turn her down....
K. I need all those Colourpop pencils and gel liners.
You made my day💕
I'm too busy wondering if that's a picture of someone's face in the background, been trying to figure out who it is whole video😭😂
Bawled my eyes out at Endgame
i love you queen! you’re beautiful❣️
who else loves manny?
I love you!!! Your amazing!!
Plz try lipsense makeup try there water proof mascara it’s AMAZING
The LOSERY of it all! 😂😂 But that fab fan with the highlight is everything. Who doesn’t want to bust out a fan when applying their highlight!?!
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can you list the product
" I said ..where! " lol
Need the small hands for clapping 👏🏻 😆
Hi manny I just subscribed... if I find out there’s beef between you and Tati I gotta go though okay... so hopefully not because I think I’m really gonna like your channel 😋
Love you Manny! But did anyone else notice that he put up a pic of an ofra liner and it was supposed to be Morphe ? Lol oops
Giiiirl ily 🤷🏽‍♀️❤️
The White Walker eyes!! I about died! #punintended <3
I spit my drink out when he did the Hercules clap. This is why I love Manny
I use the elf lash primer and I love it. I def see a diff when I use it. I don't really wait for it to dry but I do put on 2 coats of primer.
“it looks like I’ve been punched in the lip” 😂😂😂
Damn I laughed so hard at moments 🤣 I’m dying to try those pencil liners and gel liners by ColourPop but they still haven’t send me their PR with them 🤨😭😭 jokes asides I would die to receive those new liners by ColourPop😩😍😍😍
Im back and the brows are filled im back and the brows are filled OW!! 😂
Such a cool look! 😍
8:51-8:53 literally LOL’d 😂😂😂😂
Ur amazing!!! U make me laugh !!! Thank you !!
I never have tried the primer..but the kush mascara..is majorly awesome in my opinion
Omg next time you use that aqua liner use the gel in the waterline to on top of the pencil for a pigment punch x
also the weight loss is looking incredible manny!! you had nothing to be uncomfortable about in my opinion but i hope you’re getting to where you want to be to be comfortable 😘☀️
I'm living for this eyeshadow look!  All the way here! 😍
"The house" is so fetch
omg i cried so hard at avengers end game too! 😭😭😭😭😢😢😢
Call Lowes home improvement, they can do whatever you want for a fraction of the cost, really i get them to order all sorts of stuff for my house.
I love watching him but he ALWAAAAAYZ sounds and seems like he’s on a good one!
Love ya Manny!!
Honestly love u 😍💕😘
Manny I love you 🥰
i got blinds for 7 dollars at walmart and they work great lol no strings too so thats a plus
Love your blind story 😂😂😂
Manny, I can't believe you've been putting a lot of makeup on your face to look pretty and you're my idol!!!
This is my fave eye look you’ve ever done! The colors are so pretty together😍
This is my fave eye look you’ve ever done! The colors are so pretty together😍
You definitely need to meet Nadi from Pop luxe ! He 100% has thing for you and he's gorgeous if he was straight and I was 15 / 20 years younger trust me I'd be his stalker. I think you pair would be an amazing couple. Both of you clearly have built up sexual tension. Drop him a message any man would find both of you gorgeous even if they won't admit it. Xxx
love this makeup look 🤩
cried too for endgame
Thank you babe!
Honey, go to home Depot! They're super cheap and easy to install!! I love my cordless blinds!!!
lucky u got to see endgame, but u love kingdom hearts, makeup, n marvel, i wish u were my sibling manny 😍😍
Plzzz do a skin care, I don’t know which products to buy for my dry skin 😩😩 plzz help
I stopped a job application to watch lmao
I cried sooo hard toooo😭
Okay gracias now I’m going to have to buy the tarts palette “ @saalgado19” using my hubbys acc lol
I’ve used the Milk Kush mascara alone without the primer and it worked magic on my straight af lashes! Even though the primer didn’t work well for you, I’m still willing to try it since I don’t wear falsies very often, although eyelash primers haven’t worked for me in the past.
why didn't you use the new products for brows of KYLIE COSMETICS?
They glided? Glidded glid they glew! 😂😂😂😂
Look at that skin!! 👏
I don’t even know why they make lash primer. It does NOTHING
Looove the background
Girl if you don't go to home depot and get your basic as blinds and a drill .... I guarantee its easy af
I cried so hard at the endgame movie like I was a big baby
Pls come out with blushes!!!
I think I gotta go shopping soon lol
I freakin' love you Manny, but I was low-key crying laughing when you said you were clapping your hands like Nicole Kidman who was clapping like a "eel"
You need to come out with a eyelashes line!
Omg your brother got a gf?????? Damn. Lol
Sunday morning???
You look so buff lately 👀😉😋
The cover fx duo😍
This look is gorgeous 😍
I cried too during endgame!
Sooo funny.. love watching you!
$7k is like the price of a used car
I like the background
8:11 I say flabbergasted like literally all the time
I’ve never been this early on a video 😍
That concealer was way overpriced for only 5 grams of product.
WHAT ABOUT KYBROW OF KYLIEEEEE?
can you come to pittsburgh do my makeup??
“Blue like punched in the lip look” 😂 looks like it plumped up your lips just a little bit! Ugh the Aqua! 😘🥰
Me too on the Cadbury eggs!!!! I love them!
How much adds a video needs? Girl
End game though 😭😢
Kybrow would’ve been a good eyebrow product 😬
I want to enter the giveaway
Let it dry first then apply 😉
7,000$ I said where ???!! 😂😂😂
Lmao, I haven’t even watched all the way through and I’m dying. The blind quote and the story of the girl. Tooooo much.
Love you Manny 😍❤️
love that intro
Love the eye look very pretty!
Live for your videos 💕
anyone else hate cadbury eggs but loves manny?? 😂
Have you tried Kylie’s eyebrow products? If not could you review them for us. Thamks

anyone else spot the ofra pencil at 21:27 captioned morphe... lol oops
Only 15 Cadbury Eggs? All I can say is thank god they only come out for a limited time! They are soooo good! You are so adorable BTW!
I don't get "the house"!
Manny deberías hacer un video usando nomas productos de maquillaje de Mexico y hablando solamente español 😉 #doublechallenge
I love youuuuu🤗🤗❤️❤️💙💙💙💙
Love you bebe❤
Just go to Home Depot and buy blinds then hire someone!!! Way cheaper and totally worth it!!
With lash primer, it’s used for volume and or length. Freaking love it. And don’t wait for it to dry cause it will cause clumping. Get that mascara on as fast as you can after the primer.
Love love love you!!!💗
This LOOk 💕🌻
My fav! I love you 🥰
Me encanta cuando hablas en español 🤩🤩🤩🤩 y eres bellísimo,tu cabello me mata 😍😍😍😍
7000$ thats a whole construction job ....was she installing the window too df
You can literally go to Home Depot and get them for less than a couple hundred dollars!!! And they have a great selection :)
Love when you say “what the freak” 😂 reminds me of my 13yr old self
That lip ain’t itttttt, but everything else looked bomb also AVENGERS: ENDGAME WAS EVERYTHING!!! Perfect conclusion to a decade long series of movies. Huge fan and it literally gave me everything I wanted and more.
I LOV THIS LOOK SO MUCHHHHH
#mannyacfam
no one is talking about the hercaleez thing omgaaaaa 😂😂😂😂
I love watching manny while high
Love ya Manny!
favorite channel on youtube right now
Bring Mr. Kate back!!
You do know they sell cordless basic blinds at bed bath and beyond for like 40$ each...
Lol the nose hair part 😂😂
Love the new background
"Cute ass aqua moment "
Like Bad Bunny with the nails ☠😹😹😹
waiaiiaiitt... my love.. 21:28 morphe lip liner but a pic of ofra lip liner
Manny. Just Stop it. Your are just not real anymore. What happened.......I remember your first Videos....makes me so sad
I love you 3000!!
I adore you my love ❤️❤️❤️
Go to Lowe’s and get some blinds lol
Same I cried 😰😭
I love you in this lighting !!!
I'm confusion lmfao I dieddddd
By the way just do the blinds yourself. It's so easy and it'll be so much cheaper boo. 🤟
Love you Manny ❤️
Your almost to 5M subscribers 😅
“It glid so gewwwwd”
Love you Manny!!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 
Manny is sooooo freakn hilarious
That is blind lady omg has she lost her mind, ummm yea by love u lots Manny xo
Love ❤️ you so much
$7000?? Shit they better open and close themselves. That's insane. We spent a couple hundred on some nicer ones without cords, and put them in ourselves.
Lash primers are a scam to me am i the only one who feels that way?
Oh, Manuel! They glid!?!? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LOVE THAT COLOR ON YOU! 😍
Where is that neon brush from? 😍
The same thing happened to me with the kush mascara. I didn’t have the primer but I ended up returning the kush mascara and brow gel because I didn’t like the results.
I would love to see the yellow from the BH pallet paired with a soft pink for a cute summer time pink lemonade look
My boyfriend and i cried like babies during end game 😫
I love that color shirt on you, but it may be what is causing the lip color to look a bit blue.  Maybe try it with another shirt and see if the blue is still there, because the lip color is really pretty on you, so it would be great if you could wear it without looking like you are low on oxygen!
Omg the blooper yes I hate that sound when something scrapes aughh
Look at many using other brushes than morphe 😂😂 who is she 😂😉🥰😘❤
Mannnyyyyy you are QUEEN
32$ for that little concealer oh hell nawwww 😤
I actually like the natural light
Loved this eye look!!!!
I wonder why manny never does collabs?
Love you 😍
what brushes are you using in the beginning of the video?
the Morphe lip liner is a picture of the ofra lip liner
This is the only positive thing that has come out of today
Dont apologize for a long video I love longer 20+ min videos :))) this video was awesome I have never tried anything color pop before but those liners look awesome and I love how it looks like an art set kind of! Love the eye look too :)
YEESSS ADELAINE’S PALETTE WITH TARTE 😍
Does anyone know what brush he was using for bronzer with the bright green handle? 😬🙏🏼
Love the fun eye look!
12:57-13:25 😂 like same LOL

Please do a dedicated video on Adelaines palette!!
Omg that bronzer, @badgalriri wow. Best bronzer you ever wore. Ever.

Thats some SERIOUS bullshit about the blinds. We got our 2 story house with a lottt of windows, dark wood blinds really nice ones, every single window in the house, they came & installed them all & they're gorgeous, for a little over 3 thousand bucks.
Like an eel 😂 you mean seal 😂

Shook by the eye look tbh 😍😍😍
Before the eyeliner your shadow was making me want a delicious Mai Tai. Mmmm a Mai Tai eye and tall cool Mai Tai cocktail and you are ready for the Summer.

“Wow wow wee wow wow” 😂
You make my laugh 😆
Manny! Please review the tarte Facetape foundation! I love it and I feel like they really stepped up and made an effort to correct the original nightmare that was shape tape foundation. Not a lot of people have reviewed it and the couple I’ve seen haven’t given it a chance because it’s “too little too late”. Please give it a review i want to know your thoughttssssss
Omg I love you
did you get a new camera sis
Yeesss! Like bad bunny baby! With nails
I love Manny so much!
Manny!!!!! What sponge are you using!!!!!!!
I love you 3000 #ifyouknowyouknow
Um so I started watching this video and within the first few minutes I was laughing so hard that I had to pause the video so I could hear what you were saying. Within the last few months I’ve really been enjoying how you’re making your videos because you really let your humor go and I’m literally so freakin exciting every time you post a new video. Ok. Sorry for the long rant but you’re funny as hell! Love you 😘
14.36 the cutest thing everrrr
I feel like the lady who gave you the ridiculous quote for the blinds knew who you were and charged you that much just because of that. messed up
Wow we love an early queen
I love you soooooo much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What brand of sponge he's using ?
, looking amazing
Woooo
Clapping like an seal. Lmao
Same I love blush sooo much lol I’m waiting for Tarte to come out again with a pallet with their rainforest blushes

I'm dead at 7k
Miss Adelaine palette 😍😍😍😍
Gorrrrrrrgaaaaa
I love you Manny!
MANNY i have a question do you usually go out and about after you do a full face video? Just wondering why sometimes when you have multiple eye palettes to try, you dont just go crazy with the look so that way you test everything
I love youuuuuuuuuuuu
Love that color on you😍
You look great.
What brand are the neon makeup bushes ?😍😍😍😍
Love you Manny ♥️♥️♥️♥️
when i use primes mascara i put the black on when it’s still wet and it give me amazing lashes
Manny, hunty, come see me or any other  specialist at home depot we will do your blinds at a great price. 7k?!?! That's outlandish, I can get you the blackout rollers you want waaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper
I LOVE YOU💕
What sponge is that x

Kim k makeup VS. Kylie Jenner make up ??  😭😭💕🙏
💛💛💛💛💛💛
LOVE YOU MANNY!!!!
Manny ❤️
I actually like the greenery that I can see through your windows, but I get that you need blinds for night. You might want to see if you can get NON-custom blinds that will fit your windows from a place like JC Penny’s. I think you should be able to find inexpensive vertical blinds that work just fine if you shop around (but I’m not an expert).
LOVE U SM !
lol !!
You’re right, I’m wrong, I’m going to shut up! 😂
Ok Manny to be a proper STAN I need a restock on your lippies. I’m gonna have to file charges. This is getting serious Manny.  Xoxo.
Kinda early ig
What is this "the house" about..Why is all the gurus saying this 😅😅😅😅
I love manny 3000
love love love that eyes look!!
Clapping eel? #dying
Love Love Love your videos!!
tht looks more like a tangerine than a yellow on my end
Love love 💗
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII✌🏼
BAE❤
That giveaway
you are sooo funnny
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Cellulose blinds run about $250 - $500/window, depending on size and fabric. So unless you have fourteen huge windows that was very high. If you want to save money, take measurements and pick out what you want at Lowe’s or Home Depot. They also have installers if you don’t want to DIY.
someone phone michael finch
Love you Manny Mua ❤️
Ohhhh sissss
Do daisys pallletep
Manny ur dang videos have been funny af 😭 Loveeeee
😍😍😍😍😍
Love u Manny
I send your videos to my friend. She calls me “Granny Harlow” 😂 first of all, I’m 36!! And she says “What in the actual hell are you watching, Granny Harlow?” She knows nothing about makeup. But I send them because you’re so damn funny. Like I laugh like a banchee 😆 Love you!!
abs...the house
What I have those blinds and got them at Home Depot for $13 $7000 for something you can do yourself omg
💗
Plot twist: Manny is the night king

MY LOVERRRRR
Te amooo ❤️
It’s so weird how the buxom lip tint looks so pretty on your top lip yet weird on the bottom!
❤💋
That yellow tho
Nicole Kidman clap 😂
Love u so much too!!!!! 😌😌😍😍😍😍😍😍😌
<3
For me personally my lash primer doesn’t make a huge difference in the appearance of my lashes, it just helps to protect my lashes for when I remove my makeup, it helps prevent as much breakage and stuff:)
“Mira que wow” ❤️❤️❤️👌🏼
Uggg I hate when people try to take advantage
I feel like I’m the only one that didn’t cry when I seen avengers end game 😔
Fav eyelook of yours you’ve done in a while
Did u move
Snapchat fammm 💫💞
😍😍
Querido manyyy los delineadores de color pop no deben usarse en la línea del agua debajo de tu ojo hay review que no lo recomiendan ten cuidado te amo algo lo que haces
i use the l’oréal lash paradise mascara and lash primer and i have to say it makes a huge difference at least for me!!! my lashes aren’t very curled or that long but when i use that lash primer, let it dry, then use that mascara it works wonders!!
What brand are those yellow brushes Manny is using????
On would go yourself just have someone who can do measurements:)you can even special order from Lowes:)Just Saying
Mascara will work better with a primer. It may seem like an unnecessary step, but smooth a quick coat of primer on before your favorite mascara and you'll get thicker, longer, and stronger lashes. How? The formulas in today's story thicken, lengthen, nourish, and provide a perfectly tacky surface to which the mascara adheres.
The amount of times I've sung "I'm back and the brows are filled" around the house is actually embarrassing!
♡♡♡
❤️❤️
💜💜
😍😍😍
Baby you can go to like Home Depot and get some of those blinds. I’m sure that they would install or something. 😂
Manny you can measure your windows and go to Lowe’s and special order blinds and then hang them yourself or Nick can do it, it’s seriously easy, if I can measure and then hang blinds anyone can 😂 but seriously you can do it yourself for just a few hundred bucks. Or even order them and then hire someone to hang them for you way cheaper than that chick quoted. She’s crazy to be trying to charge those kinds of prices and if people are actually paying her that then they’re idiots! 😂 and then to be a rude ass to a potential customer, I mean she obviously has to charge those prices because most people don’t want to hire her and her nasty attitude! 🤣
Hahaha
❤️❤️❤️❤️
👍🏻😂💖😍😍🤗🤗❤️❤️👌🏻✨🎨🎨💜💌💚💄💄💄
What brand are the neon brushes ?
Your goofy the lippie looks fine
Is it necessary to curse that much ??
7k for blinds... Wtf. What they made of for that price. ...
You’re sooo cuttte :)
“I’m back and the brows are filled”. I live for the song!🎼🎤
12:58 the things he does for us lol
I’m dead WTF 7 grand on blinds .. bittttchhhh
Who was your MVP from Game of Thrones? Mine was Little Bear Lyanna and Arya of course...
Why are all of my ads in Spanish!?!?!?

If u want a bronzer that is just as amazing and so cheap butter bronzer by physician formula the sun kissed one is sooooo buildable and amazingly similar to the fenty one ur wearing. It’s the only one I wear cuz imma broke mama lol

Please shave...
I LOVEYOUUUUUUUU
Daaaamn the blind lady thought she could treat you like a dumb pendeja, unacceptable!!!!   No ma'am!  Better hire Julio at hone deeepo, help someone needing the work and save some funds.
BLINDS.COM dude!!!!!!!!
That’s woah🥵!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
What yellow bronzer brush is thattttt
@12:54 “I’m back and the brows are filled” I’m living for the song and dance he made up!
i was dancing to “i’m back and the brows are filled”
So i’m laying in bed crying and depressed and I started your video I smiled, so thank you!
Your performance, “I’m back and the brows are filled”....... i lol’d probably way too hard at that!
Just go to home depot. The blinds will cost you like $300 and an afternoon.
That new song you made up tho “I’m back and the brows are filled” slayyyy
Yay! Always love watching new make up being tested!! Tell us if it’s worth our moneyyyy honeyyyy ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
What brand of brushes are the neon ones you use???
How has no one else commented that eels can’t clap?!! Cuz the don’t have hands or flippers. Seals do though....
T.j.maxx 💗 $100 😱
Mija do yourself a favor and go to Lowe’s ❤️ great blinds and super adorable. Custom.
You’re so funny I can’t take it. I love your videos——you make me laugh the entire time. When you kicked while singing that brow song, I just about died. I love you, don’t ever stop making videos, hey make my month!
Please stop putting liner on your water line! You’re killing your meibomian oil glands!!
Awesome
I love you manny! 😘 When can we see a tutorial of you doing your hair? ;3 it's always on point! 😇😍
💋💋💋💋💋
If she was rude screw her. But blinds are expensive. Just for two doors to get some basic blinds was 3000 dollars.
We got a quote like that before. It was for new windows... $43,000 and a 2 hour sales pitch that was a fricking waste of time. Then after the "sale" they were having, it dropped it to $32,000... but we had to ask if the original price was the promotional price... All the other quotes for comparable products ranged from $5,000-$8,000... think the guy was trying to rip us off much? Yea... those people suck sometimes. I swear they pad the price based on the cars in the driveway, the size of the home, and how well its been cared for. Its BS. The price should just be the damn price. And the $43k guy, my husband literally had to chase him out of our house because he wasnt going to leave. So the cops were threatened in our instance too. So, just know it happens to everyone. You weren't singled out.
That creepy whited out eye giggle at the beginning was hilarious. I'm just gonna say what everyone is thinking...You would make one sexy monster or vampire in a show or movie.
ILY
AAAAAAA ADALAINES PALLETTTTTTT AAAAAAA
Where you get the yellow brush
Please please please glam the try guys!!
Can you do a dia de los muertos makeup tutorial for Halloween?
Pinche not pinchy :)
i wish manny did check in’s when he reviews things ......
Your face is soooo pink
I watched endgame, and during the final scenes, some ASSHOLE decided to make a bomb threat and ruined the whole movie. I had me and my kids with me and we are suffering still for the traumatic experience. Ugh. Watching this video tho, makes me happy at the moment.
I love u manney u always have great video's and content.. wished more YouTubers was like u and Laura. My 2 faves..
😘❤💙🧡💜
If it’s hyped new makeup I assumed the magic star herself would have been in it... probably the most hyped concealer since shape tape. A review would be incredible ❤️
Sometimes it's hard to watch you because of your damn MOUTH!!! On a few occasions I've had to turn you off because you'll drop the F bomb a bunch of times in a row and it's all you say. I like to watch you while I'm doing something like cooking, etc and I'm like DAMNNN Manny chill, my kids are near. I'm totally fine with a couple throughout the entire video because I dont live a swear free life but I've had to miss out on the rest of your videos because I dont want my kids hearing that many F words.
7000 for blinds😱?! What are they made off, Panda??!🐼🤔😂
This eye look is EVERYTHING :)
YO TJMAXX I WAS SHOOKETH!!!!! It was so much fun!!! But some of this makeup... mam...
You totally said Marshall’s instead of TJ maxx during the lash part lmao I had to relook at the title for a sec haha 🤣
your vibe in this video made me like remember an ex close guy friend's like vibe & how they act. 😕 i miss it. but thank u manny for making me laugh, i love this & u !!! ♥️💓💕💖💖💞💗

Love your videos... Your mom is so cute.  I am from Columbus, Ohio. I love TJMaxx... I have found some amazing deals on makeup.  But I have to say, I hate when people stick their nasty fingers in the products to swatch it in the store.  There is nothing worse than buying something, just to get it home and someone has had their nasty fingers all in the product. OK... I am getting off my soap box now.  Wish you great things, Manny.

Manny♡♡ I love you♡♡ ...enough said ; ) been subscribed for years. Not gonna lie, the gift card would change my life . I recently went back to work for a local hair salon. Last year this time my home was burglarized so many times I lost my home. Along with everything inside. I currently share clothes with my boyfriend, which in a salon setting isn't appropriate. I have no makeup. Feeling good about myself again would mean everything to me. I know it's a long shot. Either way,  your such a inspiration and I love your content.

Marshals is a sister store to TJ Max and you have to open every product to make sure it isn't broken or swatched. Next time you should go to the skin care area and take a look at the great buys you can find.

TJ Maxx has some really cool stuff. You just need to be careful and check nothing has been used and look up the expiry date (usually products that go there are around 2 years old when it come to regular collections and almost brand new discontinued limited editions). And maybe don't do a full face of TJ Maxx because not all stuff they sell is great, but you can usually find at least one bomb product each time you go there

As a single mom & MUA I love finding a great deal on great products .

Great video and love your mom. Ella es tan bella.

Hey, Manny. You are absolutely my favorite youtuber. I would DIEEEE if I got recognized by you, let alone won something from you. I am from Mississippi. I have always wanted to post videos of my own, I just haven't got the guts to yet because making you tube videos is not a normal/accepted thing where I am from. But you give me life and motivation everyday. My instagram is grooklynbamble. I would love for you to reach out to me.
16:33 😂😂 i love you!!!!!!!
I’m from Michigan and you’re literally one of my biggest inspirations! I fell in love with you channel when it first started and have been following up ever since I have watched you grow and honestly couldn’t be happier! You go Manny ❤️
Pick me i just lost my job and i need to have my daughter sauced up even with out a job I grew up poor so i do the most for my baby girl
Lmao you crack me up

There is a tj maxx less than two miles from my house but I can only afford to go there once year ( when discounted stores are still a splurge ) - btw I live right outside providence Rhode Island and you can reach me @vaginalvoodoo  on twitter insta and snap.

16:50 🙈🙈😭😭
This was hilarious!!!
Why is it that he is still doing his makeup better with these little hands than I can do with my regular hands...🙄🙄

You look sooooo beautiful on makeup
This was hilarious.

This is the funniest video I have ever watched!😂😂 all I thought about was deadpool and you even sound like Ryan Reynolds so I was dying watching this 😂😂😂😂
Love it!!
manny is so funny i love him so muchhh
He does a better job with his tiny hands than I do with my normal-sized hands....
Damn Manny! I just started watching Games of Thrones and that Jamie Lannister reference was a real spoiler. Also I laughed so hard my tummy hurts
I haven’t laughed this hard in a while.!!
8:22 - 8:32 sent meeee
Anyone else see how he says shapetape foundation but the thing says concealer? Am I wrong here??
Omfg laughing so hard
Him putting on makeup with tiny hands is 1000x better than me doing makeup normally... This is just sad.
Make up removal. Put a good dish washing liquid directly onto each stain. Rub it in. Toss into your hamper and let it sit until you do laundry. If it's a particularly nasty stain rub some more dishwashing liquid in just before you run it through a warm or hot wash cycle and it should come out if it didnt come all the way out, repeat the process and that should do the trick. It should work on lipstick, foundation, blood and other stubborn stains.
Lol this was too funny also why is mannys eyeliner using tiny hands is better than mine when I do it normally.
i love you !!! you’re so funny ❤️❤️
I am rolling😂😂😂
🙌🏼😂😂😂😂
loveqdddd it! so funny
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard at makeup video 😂😂😂
Omg I laught so hard
Ahh Schitts creek. I lost it 😂
I’m wearing this high lmaooo
I honestly love your humor!! Adorable
0:35 - 0:40 😂
Hahaha hilarious😃
Grease lightening works for getting out most stuff
Why does your eyeliner on your worst day look better then mine on my best day 😆
Try regular make up remover wipes and if that doesn’t work try peroxide. Peroxide won’t take any color from your clothes either but it will take up all biological stains like blood urine etc. It takes out make up out of my t shirts too
This is so entertaining 😂😂
ITS BRING IT AROUND TOWN
is it me or has he done this one before???? having major deja vu
Love it😂😂😂
This is so funny! 😂
he don’t do the giggle no more😧😭
Where did you get the tiny hands from?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Blowing the kiss did me in.
I have to watch this again and again and again 💕💕💕💕
I wish I was related to Manny
why is Manny’s eyeliner with tiny hands way better than my eyeliner with my normal hands....
Why can he do a wing with tiny hands better than me!? 😟😫
Yass!!!💜💜💜😂😂😂
A good way to remove stains from clothes is use borax on damp cloth with a toothbrush and scrub in circular motions then wash like normal
shout gets everything out
3:15 for some reason the hands look real 😂
That wing liner is the best!!!!!!
I’m done 😂
Huge salute to this vedio
Manny does eyeliner with little hands better than I’ve ever been able to do eyeliner in my whole life
17:25 cried laughing
What is the shade of that liquid eyeshadow???
Manny doing eyeliners with little hands is better than I ever could with and tool God gave me
Manny's a mood
You know what else some how he did better eye liner than me with little hands and not being able to hold the pencil?
HAHAHAHA
This is so funny😂😂😂😂
there is this cleaning spray and im pretty sure it will take out your makeup from your sweeter. its called la's totally awesome with red writing and the bottle is clear and the spray color is a yellowish color.
Too funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LMAO that little dance you did with them
10:52  manny: “be strong Harry be strong” 
Me: spits my whole cup of coffee out 😭 idk why that was so fuckin funny 🤣

Holy shit that made me laugh so much more than I expected. Now I have a headache. Worth it.
Is it just me or am I from the future. Didnt you post this video last year? I am confused...
I just started this video and I’m screaming laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂

You applying lunar highlighter on (especially down the bridge of your nose) and getting all quiet and serious but not being serious at the same time was so funny... I lol’d so loud i thought I was gonna wake up my sleeping babies
So so funny. Kinda reminds me of the butler from Scary movie 2
Use a mixture of zote and Roma use a little brush to scrub the products in and then wash it

When his eyeliner with these hands looks better than anything I’ve ever done with normal hands
You yelling at your brushes and makeup with tiny hands is me applying makeup on the daily 😂
This was so funny lmfaoooo
😭😭😭😭😭😭 I needed this laugh
This was hilarious!!! Tip on keeping clothes white; resolve spray and wash directly on stained area, and then dump some more in, with oxy clean powder, (a scoop or 2) directly in machine (even a front loader). Any detergent of ur choice . Wash with warm water. If it doesn't completely come out, do it all again. This will work for any colour too. Hope this helps!!!
kinda late
Love you Manny
This is literally the BEST video I have ever watched on YouTube 😂 thank you for this 👏🏻🖤😂

“Manitos” 😂😂😂😂 I love this
When he does his makeup better than mine with tinny hands 😂❤
This is so frustrating to watch😐
I’m having such a hard time lately but I’m so grateful that this video cheered me up I laughed the whole way through 😂😂
You are awesome so funny 🥰🥰🥰
❤️you!!!!!
This was so funny oh my god 😂
Oh my god I died the entire time! 😂.. When he blew a kiss to the camera I came back to life just to die again 😂
He does his makeup better with tiny hands than I do with my regular hands.
Use dish soap on the make-up stains , they will come out. Lol! Apply it , scrub it , leave it sit for an hour or so then wash it! 😉 I learned this from experience.
I laughed so hard. Especially when he needed to move his head instead of his hands to blend his eyeshadow
I’m crying 😂
The trump challenge!
🤣🤣
BIIIIIITCH THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO I'VE SEEN TO DATE!!!!!! you are a genius manny!!!!!!! keep up the good work 😘 love u ❤
I think he meant 

“BRING IT AROUND TOWN”

😂😂😂😂❤️
The brows got me, I was so stressed. Literally started crying laughing 😂😂😂
I can't even do my eyeliner without those tiny hands😂
Some time i forget that the hand’s aren’t real 🤣🤣
You a damn good job idk what you talking about stunning and bihhhhh that liner came out good too laugh the entire time love you manny ❤️❤️❤️
I can’t stop cracking up bro the little hands are everythingggggggg 😂😂😂😂😂
Best Makeup tutorial of 2019 so far 😂😂😂😂😂
There's an oxiclean stain stick, it's a blue Gel. I've gotten a mixture of blood, sweat, and makeup out of colorguard gloves with that stuff! Shaving cream is also supposed to work.
Omg this video gave me the worst anxiety ever! My shoulders and neck were tensed the whole time. Now I need to see a chiropractor.  Thanks Manny! Love you bae hats off to you
😂💕💕💕 love the tiny hands
I find myself saying "i hate myself i hate everyone" on occasion...did i pick that up from you, Manny? @17:18
Waait.. where's my giggle?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I'm dying over here!!! Great video!!
I cannot.  Lol.
Like si vienes del video de Rosy 🙊 para ver el delineado de Manny jajaja
Why does your little hand eyeliner look like mine lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I died. ☠️☠️☠️
“Omg it looks worse than I thought...cool”
Literally me most days. This was fantastic...easily one of the best full face videos I have had the pleasure to watch in a while.
My new favorite video! Watched it after work yesterday and it made the rest of my day 😂 Now back to watch it again.
Omg this is so funny!😂😂 3rd time watching!!🤣
Even with the tiny hands his winged liner looks 5000x better than mine 😂
That moment when you realize mannys skills  are so good he can do a winged liner with tiny hands better than you can 😓😓😓😓😂😂😂
😃😂😃😂Manny my hubbyz ask me what are u watching I was laughing tfs peace/Love
Omg Manny I love your videos, it’s just so fun to watch you ❤️
I laughed so hard!! love you x
I saw this and had to click on it right away LOL ILY MANNY
😂😂 oh my god that eyeliner is better than anything I can do with normal hands FML 😂😂 👑
Also....put a cup of white vinegar in the wash when you wash that jacket haha
This video is the best. You’re hilarious and honestly get me crying I’m laughing so hard. 🤣😂🤣
This is the best video on the internet. No one will top this. <3 XOXOXO
Oh my god I’m crying!😂😭 so funny!!! I love doing challenge vids!!!😝👌🏼
When Manny uses little manitos and STILL does better winged eyeliner than you’ve ever done in your whole life lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hyperventilating
Why is Manny's liner still better than mine?! I feel like I say those things every single time I do liner. Can little hands be my reason?!
Hahahah he caught himself and said noooo
this didn't come out so bad love it :)
I love it its soooo funny with the tiny manitos
Manny Mua struggling for 23m straight 😂😂😂 I love it
Omg! I have laughed so hard my magic star concealer creased!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Definitely not a video to watch after a good core workout 😭 but like I am impressed.
I pinchi promise!! Hahaha Manny this is by far one of your best videos in a while. Love you 😍💚
manny recommended the hydro grip primer... i paused the video, brought it and then came back again
When Manny can do a wing with tiny hands better than I can do a wing normally 😂
This was hilarious 😂 you made my day. You should do your mom’s makeup with them 😆
I think doing a mukbang is probably easier than putting makeup with these tiny hands. Also, maybe using makeup products that normally are easier to use with hands and fingers would be best specially for eye shadows. Even using a fabric puff that comes with the strap to apply foundation and powders, even bronzer and blush, would have help. I would have use the tiny hands to apply the brow pomade, little at the time. I think overall, it's a fun challenge.
When Manny’s tiny hands makeup (especially the eyeliner) turns out better than your normal hands makeup. I don’t know whether to laugh or cry lol.
LMAO I’m crying you’re my fave
#BrandiTv did this but she didn’t plan it well and cut off a  baby doll hands, one of the hands was in a fist.....and duck taped them to her hands😂 it was bomb af and HILARIOUS!!
Xo Manuel!!
This was hilarious 😂😂😂😂
Yesss huntyyyy!! 💕😂 #stan
this was so funny LMAO
Hahaha!!! Made my day! 😂😂
Lol now to pull out my fun hands
It dose not look to bad actually
Where did u get the tiny hands? Lol
Funniest video AF!!!😂
Why does Manny’s eyeliner look better than mine when I do it normally?!
Trying not to spoil the video by reading comments, but you’re so brave for doing this with white on! 🤣 You’re literally stunning 😍

P.S. you do better eyeliner with tiny hands than I can with my real hands 🤦🏻‍♀️
Why do the small hands actually suit Manny?😅🤣
I’m dying! 😂🤣😭😂😂🤣 I had to pause the video so I could breathe 🤣😂😂🤣
This is THE FUNNIEST video I’ve ever seen! I love you so much Manny 🥰 #MANNYAC 🌙
Your hands are so red from the grip on the tiny hands 🤣😭
I love you even more!!  I love Jaime French and she deserves so many more subs!!  Thanks for shouting her out!!

The colours in that too faced palette are really nice, and the look that he created is stunning:)
But nevertheless I don't like the packaging of the palette. The way the shadows are set out is such a waste of space, and makes the palette unnecessarily bulky, even though it fits the name of it.:) 

Greetings from Troisdorf, I am from Germany :)

THE DAY IS FINALLY HEREEEE!!! Whos ready for this Wednesday?! 😱
oh no sis this ain’t it :/
These are lovely dont get me wrong. 

I just miss the days where "affordable" meant like $10 max. Now days $26 is the new fair.
I love you manny but $26 dollars highlights is not fair I’ve seen you drag brands for that price point for a highlights a fair price would have bee any where between 15-20 bucks
He’s more excited about the packaging...he didn’t even say how product you would be getting  or go in depth with the formula
Imagine a "dark side of the moon" collection, with this packaging, but in black  with purple, silver holographic shine,  that'd be so pretty 🖤

Omg Thank u for the likes! ☾💜
The packaging looks beautiful but the price D: 26 bucks for .35 OZ and still contains talc D: Doesn't make much sense. Maybe if it was talc free and labeled vegan
the packaging looks exactly like ariana grandes moonlight perfume......wha-
the packaging looks like Claire’s kids makeup
People still are fans of Manny? Wow.
das alottaaaa cardboard packaging for that witto thing. 🧐
i see, its gonna be a battle of the components and packaging haha
You missed the opportunity to call them “MOON SHINE” but no 😔
Okay, but why does the packaging look like the rainbow stone from dragon tales? Im living
I get that u want to creative with packaging,but really  most people just want quality and affordable products
Can you PLEASE DO A MAKEUP ROOM TOUR / MAKEUP. COLLECTION!! That background is killinnn meee
I adore the anime Sailor moon. Sailor Pluto is bae. 💜
I loved the way he showed us the product. I love that he used a brush as well!!!! I wish other would show products the same way. Good job baby!!! So proud of you!!!!!
The packaging I CANNOT!!!! My childhood, my dreams!!! I don't even need a highlighter I just want the case lol
So proud of you babe! Keep doing what you do. You’re always striving to be better and I love your mission behind your makeup line. God Bless you!
Whoever disliked this video are stupid. They just disliked it bc he's gay. I LOVE HIM HE IS BEAUTIFUL WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!!!! 😙😙😙😙
Oh Lord those looks amazingly beautiful Manny! Congrats 🎉🎊 I’m so happy for you 👏🏽🔥❤️💖
LIVING for the packaging!! I want all 4✨😍
I love how different the packaging is....ART.🐾💜💛
Felicidades Manny¡¡ lindísimo el empaque y el producto wow¡¡
I named my daughter after Sailor Moon. Her names Serena ❤️ so yeah you could say I’m a fan 😂
Manny: " I literally have no words. Eh-heh" 
.... talks a million miles a minute without a breath. 

Girl.. .. .. breathe.. 🤣
I swear the packaging for all your products is UNMATCHED!! I love it!
Omg! 😍 I'm obsessed with you and sailor moon!
I dont even use highlighters and I want these sailormoon was my idol growing up though jupiter was my fav. I love this I got the idea instantly
This product looks stunning, however I feel since they’re supposed to represent the moon you should of gave them moon names not planet names
Those are beautiful!  Congratulations ♥️
The packaging is gorgeous 👑
Omg I’m so excited! Also the packaging???? Are you kidding me ??? It’s beautiful 😍
Sailor moon fan much 🤗🤗🤗

Your highlighters are the best!
$36.26AUD for 1 highlighter + $34.86AUD for shipping.. $71.12AUD for 1 highlighter wtffffff :(
Damn Manny these look fkn bomb!! 👀
I am so excited about these highlighters! I thought, okay, just get one, but did I hear you say bundles, yes all four, thank you. 😊

The packaging makes me think of Dragon Tales the old tv show
I am SO PROUD of you! I've been following you for a while (not long enough) and to see you break through so many boundaries with such a bad ass attitude and still have so much grace is so wonderful. These highlighters are GORGE and I cannot wait to buy them! You keep doing you! xoxo

This is probably one of my top three highlighters that I’m really interested in buying. 

I really want to buy it but when I bought the life’s a drag palette on beauty bay it took 4 WEEKS (instead of 5-7days) for it to arrive. When it arrived there was a sticker on it that said that is was accidentally shipped to Australia.. I live in Belgium 🙃🙃
Just purchased them! Although the discount didn’t apply 🥺..
 I snatched mars, Venus, and mercury 😍
Ugh I can’t wait to see Jupiter on darker complexions 👏🏽😭
I love the fact that you love Sailor Moon. I grew up watching those girls. Love it✨❤️
Omg ok I need the first three!! ❤😮😍😍
Sailor Moon fanatic here, checking in👋🤩🌙⭐
Yasssssss sailor moon is my 💩 even the names of the highlighters!!! Sailor Mars is my FAV ♥️
Omg these look SO amazing!!! Congrats Manny!!! I can’t wait to get my  own!!! 🥰
You need to release primers. High quality color correcting primers. Please
Sailor Moon is everything ❤️😍 I need more sailor moon related products from you manny!!!
y'all will say anything just for a few likes.   fenty beauty's highlighters are damn near $40 but all of a sudden $26 is too expensive.... noted.

Oh my gosh Manny you look absolutely stunning! So happy for you ❤️
I bought one of the Lipglosses and it is beautiful, everyone who sees it loves the component and nice silky gloss. I'm definitely going to be a second time purchaser.  I need that light Highlighter.
I love sailor moon and when I heard the name of your highlighters I was like omgeee sailor moon
The packaging is so beautiful! I think you should use it for your entire line of products in the future.
Thank you for making separates! They are beautiful.
Your the best Manny
Yep I've been a Sailor Moon fan for years!! I have watched the originals since I was a kid!!💞 I so want to get the Sailor Moon makeup and the brushes!! Have you tried them yet??
Beautiful packaging and  product!  Please do a tutorial on this makeup look!!!
I loooooove these highlighters they look so wet/shiny I LIVE 😍
The components and packaging are so pretty! Good job Manny❤️ Also, total side note: I LOVE your eye look! What palette/colors did you use! Need to know!
MANNY can you create a palette with all of the highlighters in smaller pans? 😍
Personally, I don't use highlighters, just my preference on my skin due to excess sweat conditions and bla bla bla.. But I have your life's a drag pallet, I use it everyday, I love it! I missed out on your goddess pallet but I love the formula! It's beaut! Highlighters still look stunning!!!
Wow! I'm so happy for you! Such beautiful products. I need 😻😻😻😻😻😻

So gorgeous manny! Love the packaging so much! 😍
Those are all named after planets. There are so many moons out there that aren’t our own, it would have been so much cooler to name then after moons for the “Moon Prism” powders. The character names are cool, buuuuut.... very pretty though. Loved the swatches. Just change the names! 😩❤️
It looks just like the silver crystal from sailor moon, love it !!! 🤩
Beautiful! Mars and Venus😍😍
It's so nice to read everyone's positivity for manny its sooo nice..I hope he sells out🔥🔥🔥
Your new highlighters look amazing and I love that you have the sailor moon inspiration
So happy for you! They are gorgeous! That packaging I 🤮!
Your eyes literally catch my attention, I keep getting distracted lol🤪
Seriously though.. the Sailor Moon inspiration is everything.  I need it in mercury😍
Sailor Moon was my shiiiiiiit. I was Sailor Moon for Halloween in grade school. 💁🏻‍♀️
Not a fan or anything. But, when I saw certain someone did a shady thing and released right before you, I wanted to come watch and show some support.

Love the packaging 😍
CONGRATULATIONS!! Wow Manny!!! This idea re:packaging is PHENOMENAL!!! I freaking love it! It’s brilliant & unique! Damn, now I HAVE to buy it even if I’m not a huge highlighter QUEEN! A shadow palette with that packaging or BRONZERSSSS!!! Omg!!! THAT WOULD be fab as well! All in all, LOVE THIS!!!🌙💫🌕🌚🌗
el pinche packaging 😭 i love!!! venus is my fav omg, i can’t wait to get one! congratulations manny 💛
I legit forgot you existed. lmao. Hi, how are ya?!
That might be the most beautiful packaging I’ve ever seen👀
OMG 😲 Sailor Moon is my favorite anime ever I’m 32 and I still live for Sailor Moon, you know I’m gonna be picking this up cause I need it in my life 🥰🥰 it brings me nostalgic feelings of coming home after school everyday and watching Sailor Moon on Cartoon Network 😭😭😭 love this so much 🥰🥰🥰
They look stunning! How come the net weight is different with all of them though. Jupiter is a different formula so that makes sense but the others? This isnt me hating btw. Just genuinely curious x
Love u manny can’t wait for the powders you are amazing!!!!   ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌🏻👌🏻
Mars and mercury are my girls. Need these ASAP!!!! The component is so beautiful!
Manny I love you!! I can’t wait to try the mars highlighter 😍😍❤️💕🌙💫✨ and btw my kitty’s name is Luna which means moon in Spanish. I didn’t name her that the person who had her before named her Luna 😻🐈
I love this packaging compared to his other items! Serioisly! This is the kind of shit i want to see! Great job! That formula also looks AMAZING!!!!! I will definitely buy that peachy shade! I love it!
Love sailormoon and highlighters 😍❤
They look so wet!!! I’m living😍 congrats manny, love juuuuu💕✨
Not gunna lie I gotta get this just for the sailor moon reference 💖
Congrats  babe!!!! I hope one day have your products!!! But i live in argentina.. kind of difficult.. xoxo 😍😙
Manny kills with packaging. These look stunning actually.
The Greek Goddess formula is amazing, so these will be stunning!!!
LOVE the packaging SO much! 😍
Waiting for some duochrome collection! 🤩
Yes sailor moon sista 💕 love love love congrats Manny!
I'm a sucker for amazing packaging and I'm a huge sailor moon fan so this is a must buy for me!!! 😍😍
Living for the shade Mars and Jupiter 😍😍👏
Congrats on your launch, I love your Greek goddess pallets and can't wait until I get my hands on these beautiful highlighters 💜
I don’t need any more highlighters but they’re my weakness and these are so beautiful 😭😭💕💕
Your packaging and the products in them are just amazing!
I was just thinking the other day that I needed a white base highlight because I’ve been so pale lately and then you come out with a stunning one 😭😭 but now I want them all 😭😭😭
WHAT LASHES ARE YOU WEARING OMGGGG 😍😍😍😍
The product is beautiful, but honestly, that is the best packaging I think I've seen on anything, ever.
🎶LUNAR BEAUTY....BEAUTY BEAUTY BEAUTY BEAUTY, Rockin everywhere🎶!  So excited for you  Babyboy! Much Love MannyMob😉✌🌙💚
That package though!! So sickening ❤❤❤❤ LOVE IT. I can't wait to get my hands on them  😍😍😍
I would buy it just for the packaging. The packaging is hella nice!!!
The fact that you named the shades after the Inner Scouts,  the fact that it is named for Usagi’s transformation motto AND that the component looks like the Silver Millennium Crystal?!? YAAAAAAS!!! #sailormoon #sailorsenshi
Oh yeah I'm buying those !
Congrats Manny !!!
damn I never buy from youtubers brands but that packaging alone has me SHOOKETH! yasss congrats!
Can't wait for Lunar beauty to be back on beauty bay so I can buy. Congratulations manny
Gurl the 2 middle shades are gonna be mine 😍
Stunning!! I LOVEEEEE the packaging Manny!!
I can't find your Greek Goddess highlighters anywhere *sob*.. where can I get that and these ones in Australia?
I would love to by all the products but I’m broke af atm 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love the packaging! And your makeup looks gorg here!
So proud of you Manny 🌙☮☯️🌈😘
The packaging is cute and all but I don't feel like you have a clear vision for your brand. If you put all your products together they are not very cohesive. The judges on Project Runway would drag your "collection"
ILY Manny 💋ahh I love it ♥️💛🧡💚💙💜🖤
YAAASSSSS!!!🙌🙌🍾🍾Well done Manny, I wish you nothing but further success🍾🍾💕💕💕
The packaging is so pretty :^)
Packaging is sooo beautiful, I love Jupiter ✨
"Moon" prism powder but the shade name is base on the planets
This is so exciting! Love some sailor moon from when it first came to the US! The names of them OMG!
Watching Sailor Moon was when I realized I like women 😂🙏🏽 good memories
Fricken love Sailor Moon. I’ve seen every episode and every movie. Congrats!! Love the concept!
Exciting 💖💖😍 I'm totally living for the packaging and definitely picking all of them up!!
Congratulations 💓💓💓
THEY ARE FANTASTIC GORGEOUS I CAN,T WAIT
I will buy all 4 Wednesday when they launch!!! Great products
I love the new beauty room background m!
It’s so cool because I think that mercury would look really good on me and one time in class my teacher accidentally called my crush mercury instead of Mercer. 😍
Oh my heavens these look incredible! Yep, definitely buying at least 2 of these! They look amazing and buttery and just yum! 🥰🥰😍😍 why did watching this video make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside? Hahaha 💋💋💋
Ouch $26 for one...beautiful though!!
My love, I am SO happy for you - - and a bit thrilled for the customer!  The compact is stunning!!  Before you showed the compact, I was thinking to myself, "I'd LOVE for Manny to create a mirror!", followed by the thought, "what would Manny's mirror look like?"  Then you give us beautiful highlighters, in a beautiful compact.  Thank you for all of your hard work, time, and enthusiasm!  You're a blessing.
SAILOR MOON FOR LIFE! I’m really ready for the final season to be English dubbed though
I honestly thought it made that noise when you first opened the package and I was like that's fucking awesome lol.. Manny
OMG IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE THE SILVER CRYSTAL FROM SAILOR MOON!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Love the packaging!!!🌙⚡️
Just set my alarm for the launch. Thank you for continuing to put out good products 👍
beautiful! congratulations on your launch!
Would Venus be too dark for light skin? I looooove it but I always struggle with gold highlighters..😭
Sailor moon! Loved  it! My two boys and daughter watched them all the time!! Such a cool connection! Beautiful!! Good luck! Love you!
So happy for you and for where you are going. Just stay positive and keep going! Love it!
That swatch idea was really good
Congrats! That packing tho I live!!
I’m shocked 😱 I love love love the packaging... I have to have them ❤️❤️❤️
Moon Prism Powder Makeup!! - Sailor Moon
OMG..i can't wait to get those bomb highlighters..💎💫❤
woowww these look gorgeous! The formula looks so buttery. I can't wait to pick them up. Congrats Manny.
I'm so happy for you!! And I love Sailormoon!! 💖💖
Okay ngl I live for the packaging but the shades are a bit safe for a moon prism collection I would expect at least one fun coloured highlighter
Congrats, manny! Of course we’re excited. It looks freaking bomb 💣🔥😍
Oh and the first anime that made me the otaku I am today was sailor moon. I freaking loved that show growing up and I’m passing down the good anime to my little otaku daughter now and she loves it too.
YAASSSS QUEEN! 👑 I can’t wait!! Mars and Venus are my needs!! Love them!
I want venus in my life ASAP!!!!!😍❤
Could you wear Mars if you are very fair (NW15/10 in Mac foundation)?
Omg! So original 😒😒😒😒😒 
How inclusive 😒😒😒😒
I’m so happy for you! I love how you put so much passion and creativity in your brand!!
Patiently (not really) waiting for this reveal!! 🙌🏼❤️
Beautiful highlighters but $26 per highlighter is pretty hefty.
Love the sailor moon concept especially it not being play makeup so it’s usable and cute
Beautiful purple pink blue holo packaging but nothing but wearable gold/yellow/peachy/copper shades & no fun duochrome shades. 

You clearly have a fun vision & it showed w/ this packaging but feel the need to stick to generic shades.
okok that’s fire i want all 4  but im confused how can u see the highlighter through the packaging if there’s a mirror on the inside 😭
Oooooo I love 💕💜can’t wait to try, seriously the packaging is genius 👏🏽
If I didn’t get fired from my job i would hop on these 😭😭😍 congratulations love you ❤️
I can't wait! I haven't been able to purchase lunar beauty yet but I am definitely going to make my first purchase!!!
Manny I need a Sailor Moon inspired palette! I am trying to figure out which one I’m getting first. These are STUNNING!!
Manny! Omg I literally LOVED LOVED your new highlights. Got my package today. It is so beautiful. Like I don’t even want to use, the packaging is EVERYTHING!♥️😍
I'm buying all 4!!!! Omg so proud of you Manny!!
The packaging I’m in love with all of the shades and I’m so happy with the price point way to goo with making them much more affordable for us I was expecting 34-36 dollars 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Congratulations with coming up this products you deserve this! Keep inspiring us! Love love you 💓💓💓
I love this packaging!!! It does remind me of the rock from dragon tale lol. But in a good way
This packaging is EVERYTHING. So stunning.
Congratulations!!!!  Love ur product... Hopefully u can launch more lippies ZAYA is one of my FAVORITE lippies EVER!!!! 😍😍😍❤❤❤
Mooooooon. Prism. Pooooooooower! You KNOW I’m getting All of these beautiful high lighters!
As much as I am still very iffy with you..I am Happy for you growing your brand...never tried anything but these highlighters are stunning.  Be better to others behind the scenes in the future and you will be back on track!
Love it I love how it doesn't give you a white cast.. So proud of you babyyy 😘💖
Manny, these shades and formulas look absolutely beautiful. I mean truly and sincerely. Wow
The packaging is so pretty 😍
this is actually pretty cool - i'm a fair type of girl, but i would totally use darker shades as a blush ^^
Congratulations Manny 🎉 alarm set for sure
I get paid on Thursday so I won't feel bad about spending $$$ on Wednesday to buy everything😂 THESE ARE GORGEOUSSSS😍
It makes me giggle that both you and my youngest nephew are the same age and you were and still are Sailor Moon fans.

I used to wake my little nephew up in the morning for Montessori and the only sure fire way to get that wee boy to wake up was for me and his dad to say, "Peanut Butter (his nickname), Sailor Moon is on! SAILOR MOON is on!" That little sleeping log would sit right up, rub eyes and leap off the bed and run downstairs to enjoy his Sailor Moon. Had to videotape the shows on mornings he was too sick for school.

You Sailor Moon boys.
love that you did 4 kinds of swatches!!
Love ur background!!! Keep up the great work!!
So happy for you Manny!!!! Congrats! So excited to get these
I’m literally crying I’m so excited for these highlighters 😍😍😍
I love the packaging! Too cute 😊
Hope these will be available on Beauty Bay💕!
$25 for a highlighter is a lot tho😶
Your Amazing and beautiful!
So excited Manny!!! Love all your makeup and you! Congrats on the new line 💕 💜💜
Lunar beauty is the only brand that i'm so excited to see the packaging.. Especially the greek goddess pallete..love love love the packaging
I Loooooove Sailormoon!!! Lived for it then still live for it now. This theme is everything! I hope you keep adding more to it. 😍😘
Congratulations Manny. They are gorgeous.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! I can’t even take it . So beautiful! Never seen a highlighter like this, GREAT GREAT JOB!
Manny. Baby. I’m ready to order these like yesterday! Ahhhh I’m so excited 🤤🥰
I can't wait to find a job and start to be able to afford things like this again! Loveeeee the packaging Manny, it looks beautiful.
Manny is like the queen of packaging
So pretty!!! Love the packaging!! 😍😍
oo i appreciate the different types of swatches!! i know it's a lot but maybe do one swatch with a setting spray too next time? i love using setting spray with highlighters to make them popppp
Love you Manny and so excited for this launch!
Definitely going to buy a couple of these! The packaging is everything.
Your makeup is on point! 👌🏼 Can’t wait for Wednesday! Love you Manny! ❤️
I LOVE these!! I was OBSESSED with Sailor Moon as a kid!! I had the action figures and I’d play with them while watching the show (which I owned on VHS). I 100% had a crush on Tuxedo Mask!! I’m sure many did. 🙌🏻❤️🌙✨
I am a huge fan of Sailor Moon and of Manny's work, so this will be the perfect combo for me! Looking forward to adding some Mars fire to my look.
You have spoken to my every soul with this! I don’t think I can not make a purchase here. Sailor Moon is the most iconic anime reference you could make and I am here for it! Oh to be on a PR list right about now.
SO HAPPY AND PROUD OF YOU. LOVE YOU, KEEP IT UP.
Yep...here I am with my credit card in my hand....waiting for wednesday!!!
Why is Manny prettier than me!!!😭😭😭😭😂😂
Manny, I need Info on your lashes you are wearing in the video 😮
I LIVE FOR THE PACKAGINGG😍😍😍😍
Omg beautiful. I want Mars and Mercury!! 🌙🌠
Omg😱😱😱😱 i love Mars and Venus😍😍😍😍😍😍 i can't wait they love beautiful Manny! I love the packaging too so freaking cute!
Are they gonna launch in any of the UK retailers??? I love Venus highlighter! Perfect for my medium olive skin tone!!
Ilysm manny but I kinda think ur price point is a lil high idk I just think its a tiny bit high maybe its just me but yeah ly! ❤️❤️
HOLO ??? OH honey honey

Simply not holo....
I’m so broke right now but BIIIITTCHHH I NEEEED 😩😩
Literally stunning!! I want them all!
Just got a better look at the component on your IG stories and I honestly think it’s gorgeous. 😍😍😍
💖 It's beautiful, you did great
I love the way you showed them in different ways & love the range
Congrats 🎈🍾🎉🎊
I’ve been refreshing YouTube for the last 2min!!😂😂 love you, boo and congratulations!😘😘
Your about to loose control and I think you Like It. OH YEAH!
Love from India!💋❤
I must say from a professional PR side someone should have edited this. You talked for so long about the component.... it’s a bit of pedestrian plastic! What about the product. I’m tired and I’m yet to see it on your skin. What color will earth be? Hard pass.
HOLY CRAP! DEFINITELY GONNA GET THE ALL!!
How do you see the highlighter through a mirror?
That component 😍😍😍
Beautiful Manny! Congrats!
Congratulations Manny! They're beautiful!
Wow such beautiful packaging haven't finish the video yet but can't wait tho 😍❤❤
Manny. All of them are so freaking beautiful and I want all of them
Omg I’m living for the packaging!!! 😫💕

Mars and Venus I NEEEEED 😍 the packaging is to die for and I love the Greek goddess highlight palette so I definitely will be purchasing them!!!
Love the planets you chose. Sailor scouts!
Yass manny.. packaging is givin me life!! 😍😍😍😍
Very excited to try these! That packaging is EVERYTHING!! 🌙 🌚
Wow Manny!! These shades are stunning 😍😍
Wow! So beautiful! This is going to be such a great launch!!
Im going to start this comment off by saying your makeup is gorgeous today. Your highlighter I cannot wait to get my hands on all of these colors. The packaging is AHMAZEBALLS.🥰🥰🤗🤗
I use the Greek goddess highlight palette every single time I do my makeup. It was a total win! Really excited for these.
Eeeeee I can’t wait to buy!!!! Luv you Manny
“I own a brand lunar beauty and it is my brand” 😂
This is far from Basic I love the time you put into the details and thought behind this. The creativity is a breath of fresh air!! Love it 😍
Venus she is my favorite sailor moon scout I'm sooooo getting that one !! Manny yasssss
I'll take Mars & Venus please! Thanks 😍😍😍
i literally show everyone my greek goddess highlighter palette every time i use it. it’s so beautiful inside and out. i’m soooo proud to own it. you have outdone yourself once again manny
I use Greek goddess everyday! I cant wait to buy these!! 😍😍😍💕
we shookt omy love those😍💖
The quality of your videos 🔥🔥🔥🔥😍♥️love you
Super cute! How bout that highlighter you wore on Saturday at Coachella tho!!?? Please give details!
I rarely buy new makeup and when I do it’s always super cheap. But I want to buy these really bad. 🤩
his lil laugh at the beginning is so cute😭❤️
I want to try the mars highlight, will it be available in Canada anytime soon?
I’m living for the shades Mars and Venus 😍😍
Go manny!! Love the packaging it’s so girly and unusual. Where can u purchase this in Australia? Good job x
This is no hate but I would love to see a little more cohesion among the releases.... The themes and designs just vary so much, it's hard to say what this brand's aesthetic is.
He couldve named the shade like the moons of the planets since it is Moon Prism. He couldve used Io (Jupiter's Moon), Luna (Earth's Moon) and such.
Yesss! I was obsessed with Sailor  Moon!!! 💜💜
Looks like the fenty highlighter
Not really a fan of Manny, BUT I really really want the peachy one. The component is awesome as well. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
OoOooOoohhh Biiiiiitcccchhhhh, you did THAT!!! 😭👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
that component is so pretty though! 😍
Huge sailor moon fan here 🖐️!
the component is OUT OF THIS WORLD (literally), i am dyingggggg!!!!
It's the legendary silver cyrstal!!moom crystal power make up
I got the Moon Prism Powder in Mars, it is SO gorgeous!!!!! I’m so glad I got it and I love the price. ❤️
That packaging is 🔥🔥🔥 I love love love it!!!!!
I wish that you and Laura would take notes from Patrick Starr and make your reveal videos something to get excited about. You need to do something more than a 10 minute boring video to build some hype for your product.
I definitely gonna pick up Venus gurl I liveeeeeeee
When it's so blinding it makes you upset I don't know how to explain it but when I see a highlighter that is so blinding and poppin it gets me upset like I need that in my life like I picture myself with the highlighter and obviously blinding highlighter is the best part of my day and a good lip gloss switch would be so cool to create some glossy plumping glosses and your brand is about Galaxy kind of vibes which sailor Moon vibes and it would be so cool to have these glasses that are glossy and have some glitter in them I'm sorry good highlighters make me rant and happy and angry at the same time
They look awesome!!! Congratulations Manny!!!!
HI MANNY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN LOVE YOUR SPECIAL SHOWS WOW YOU LOOK FABULOUS TODAY
YESSSSSSS. I've been so excited for this reveal! Love you so much, Manny.💖💖💖 

PS: The component is SICKENING.
wow mercury looks amazing! they all do!!!!
Jupiter and peachy ones are my favourite
me a sailormoon fan just wanting the packaging
Okay finally when I think of lunar beauty this is definitely what I can imagine from the brand. And I honestly I hope you keep up with this theme.
I really want to purchase the Mercury and Mars highlighters. I really enjoyed the packaging, I'm a sucker for packaging
I'm still in love with greek goddess highlighter palette
I’d buy it just for the packaging
Question, why not have the actual colors of those planets for the names? Packaging is amazing but 🤦🏼‍♀️ it’s confusing how the colors of the actual planets are not in sync with your highlighters 😬😬 Kinda same with the Greek Goddess pallette then have Medusa on there..... it’s the little things.
Yes I WILL buy!!!! I cant wait!!!💟💠😉
Been looking forward to this video all week YAAAS
Congratulations!!
Meeeen!! I need it all!! Really love you❤
They are so pretty but girlllll can you please come out with some cool tones? I know there are a lot of other girls with pink undertones that would love to buy these but would look washed out with a golden glitter/undertone. Bless xx
These are flipping gorgeous and the packaging is to die for eeep!!! So excited need to snatch me one
You always have such creative packaging 😍 Love love loveee
Que cute! I want Venus and Mars. ME ENCANTA!!!!
I think the name it’s super cute but you missed the mark as a so called sailor moon fan to use neutral instead of the respective color of each sailor senshi , the packaging also looks very cheap like I could buy that at the pulga for $10 instead of $26 from your site
I definitely want to get me the lightest shade, can’t wait to see you expand the shade range. Beautifully done the packaging is amazing and super cool name for the product.
Manny Congrats on your new Highlighters coming out I am so excited for you! Well I know I will be purchasing some! I love all of the shades I have fair skin and I think all of those shades will look good on me. Again Manny I am so happy for you! Mannac for life! ❤️❤️💙💙💚💚💛💛🧡🧡💜💜
“Fritz Bernaise.” 🤣
Babydoll, your eyelashes are shook! Eep, the container and product are so beautiful!
My birthday is the 18th definitely making my boyfriend shop on the 17th for this 😁🤗
I immediately thought of our Nail girl when you talked about the holo.
Me: listening to manny talk about the highlight
Ad: YoU nEeD a NeW mObIlE pHoNe
Jupiter to looking reeeaaalll cute!!
Congrats they are BEAUTIFUL!!!!! Can’t wait to get a couple...
So proud of you, Manny! I had a horrible night at work & your excitement & giddiness brought a smile to my face. Bawling like a baby half an hour ago to giggling because of how excited you are. You did that; thank you! Hope the launch is a huge success!
So happy for you !! ❤️
Yesss! So excited! I have been waiting ! Love you Manny!

26$ for cheap packaging...no thanks
Omg Manny I'm so proud ❤❤❤❤
So excited for you Manny Mua!!!
I’m really sad it’s highlighters... how many could one person truly need?
Packaging is boring the house. Product boring the house. 
Many mua stans will love it but...gurl I'm breaking up with this reveal I'm bored.
Literally have not seen anything like that I love it
I love you Manny! I’ve been looking forward to moving back to the states so I can finally pick up all of your products! ♥️ Keep being you lovely.
LOVEEE SAILOR MOON! I AM A COLLECTOR AND GREW UP WATCHING THE SHOW AS WELL! SO COOL!!
I love it that you are inspired by Sailor Moon. That was my favorite cartoon growing up. Till this day (17 yrs later) I still like it, and even purchased the movies. Can't wait to go buy them, so exited for you too Manny🤗
That’s iridescent. @simplynailogical
i LIVE😍😍
These are beautiful! Can’t wait to finally pick up a Lunar Beauty Product!
Definitely going to buy it.. ❤
Okay please tell me Medusa will be coming back in a single cause that is one of my favs!!! 💖🖤 also hope ur working on some pink highlighters like ones that are like a silver pink & ones that are like a white pink, cause tbh brands need more pink highlighters they are the best imo

I think the makeup, your skin and everything looks so much better without your “studio lighting” turned on.
i’d buy this just for the packaging
Sailor moon is my fave... I have a tattoo of her , will get this only because of it
Sailor Moon forever!!
That packaging 😍 yesssss!!!! So excited and happy for you manny you’ve came so far such an inspiration x
Manny, why don't you ship to Mexico? I would love to buy these highlighters! 😫
Congrats manny!!! 🎉
Obsessed with the packaging!!!
Manny I just wanted to send you a note and I know you probably won't see it. But I just wanted to tell you that in the amount of time that I have watched your videos I truly have fallen in love with you & your personality and how much you truly want to make sure that we get all the info that we need to make sure that we get what we pay our hard earned money on is quality products. To see that you're bring out Quality Products that we will fall in love with is just so Exciting and I wish you all the luck in the world but I know that you don't need it. Because when you launched your first products you truly listened to your fans and you took that and truly made products that everyone is buying and I see that some of them are out of stock so I truly hope that you take that as everyone saying you have done a Beautiful job and we all trust you and your products. One more thing thank you for always making me laugh and I have so much fun watching you and I really love the way you do make up. I so wish you would do a giveaway that would be you doing a make over on a fan with all your products I'm sure that everyone would so love to get that giveaway because I would so love one from you!!! I know my pain would go away and then I would get that good pain of laughing so much and have so much fun that your sides hurt!! I truly LOVE YOU MANNY you're so Perfect in so many ways and you're truly an Inspiration to so many for so many different reasons. I really wish you much success in all your endeavors and the building of your brand I believe you are made for this and you will bring Beautiful &  Quality products to the make up industry and to all your fans that you love. XOX Manny
The packaging kinda gives me that dragon scale from dragon tales vibe. Anyone else? No? Just me? 😂❤️
Launching it on my birthday! I feel so honored! LOL Congrats Manny!
It honestly reminds me of the stone from dragon tales, the colors do at least, and I LOVE IT
The packaging for this is incredible!!

anyone thinking manny was the one who ordered the concealer robbery in jeffrey's retail house because casually he's releasing powders now... a week after
The packaging is stunning! Congrats Manni
I kinda feel like the highlight train already left the station. Its Beautiful tho! But I have enough highlighters as is. 😅
I want these so pretty!!
That packaging is everything I ♥️
as someone who is a Spaniard/German/native American mix Venus and Jupiter will slay my skin tone. Thank you boo! And this released the day before my birthday! I hope I get cash/gift cards so I can scoop these up before they sell out. Love you manny!
That packaging 😱😍 killing it!

That shirt screams "call me daddy"
Omfg I need!!!!!!!! Congratulations manny! 🤗🤗🤗
Literally cannot WAIT to put some of this on!
In love with this packaging! Can’t wait for more colors that might work better for me though. I love the gold colored one but it’ll be too dark for me, can’t wait for maybe a lighter gold/champagne
Those look stunning 😍💖
Wooow!!! I love it. I don't buy highlighters because i am not a makeup artist so i only need one. But giiiirl, you make me want to buy em!!!😭
They are called moon prisms but they are named after planets 🤔
I’m not sold on the packaging 😩 I think it looks quite childish and cheap but I have NO DOUBT the highlighters themselves will be incredible!!
Thank you for sailor moon throwbacks!!
Congratulations!!! Love them!
That packaging is to die for, ugh 😍
The packaging is EVERYTHING!
These are so beautiful😍😍
Okay that packaging is legit. Have not seen something like that yet.
Ok these look so stunning I need them rn
I wanted to keep the price really fair....26$.....LMAO
Anyone who says your packaging gives them Fenty vibes... Uh hell no! These are so much more beautiful!
You really did that with the packaging huh 😍
Love you manny !!! So excited for you ❤️❤️
Damn. These look BOMB! That peach shade... I don’t know....  I think I need it lol!

Love your make up today 💄
Stunning!!! 😍😍😍
I love how it's not so blinding at first hit like shit I was so tired beauty gurus complaining on highligters not being their standard of shine. I love highlighters like these makes you look simple and classy.
I'm not fond of highlighter, but these are gorgeous! That packaging reminds me of a Barbie doll I had as a kid. My inner crow is screaming "shiny object!"
Notification squad! Can’t wait to get my hands on these! Sending love from Colorado! 🥰
Why are the highlighter amounts different sizes??
$26?
Yayyy they look amazing
does anybody know about his products are cruelty free and vegan? 🤔☺️
I’ve heard nothing but great things about your products and the quality! This looks amazing!
Yessssssss!! Sailor Moon highlighter realness.
The packaging is BOMB !!!
Are they vegan? 😢
Omg so beautiful!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤

Very pretty Manny!! You're such a cupcake
This is probably the most beautiful  component I've ever seen!
The packaging is so good Manny! ❤❤❤
More highlighters 🙄
Sailor moon team 🌙 ♥️
packaging is STUNNING!
This is so Sailor Moon! I LOVE IT
I was always Sailor Mars...lol
Sailor power!!!! Love it
ME! Im in LOVE! Need!
I love the packaging!
U do the BEST packaging ever!!!!!!
The component is beautiful
I don’t even like Manny, but I’m not gonna lie, these look amazing.
Im going to need Mercury, because I’m pale AF. But for reals I live for white highlighters
Loveeeee the packaging!!! But $26 is to much for your brand! Not even kylie sells them that high! I'll just get them when they go on sale or something
YAAAAAAS BABY 🥰🥰🥰🥰
why do some highlighters have different net weight?
I think this might be the first single highlighter I ever buy.
I love the packaging but the highlighters themselves seem really lackluster and nothing new to the market compared to my other highlighters.
The packaging is hella cute! From the cute box to the details on the case.
Ur makeup looks extra bomb in this vid , u should do a tutorial
I just ordered the venus one. I know it will be awsome
ohh myy Gooooddddddddd screamingg 😭♥️🙈
Hi Manny! Would you consider posting a tutorial of your makeup look in this video or what you used? It’s exactly what I’ve been trying to do and I love the colors. The packaging is beautiful and I’d love to try them out in the lightest shade. 😊
Congratulations Manny. You kill it on the packaging! I bought the lip gloss from the last collection and I enjoyed keeping it out on my desk at work. It was always a fun little 🤗, when I put some on throughout the day.
Omg. Killing it with the packaging as always. So freaking pretty. Would still love if you released the medusa packaging as a magnetic palette
overpriced af
I've never used any of your products before but, after watching this video I think I need to go out and buy some!
I want to give it to you hard 😜😂😍
I love you and so excited for these. Been in the hospital with my 1 and a half year old.  He is fighting a severe pneumonia and watching you makes me happy and relax. I can't wait to buy these one I can Haha (after medical Bill's on afterpay hah) I just hope.they still are available.  I love your products especially your high lighter formula amazing!!
Beautiful i would try out the darker one
I love your unique take on your products and I'm quacking because of you creative ideas
Love it but why deal with all the packaging? Took 3 steps to get the actual product. Not impressed
I really love the packaging and there so blinding
I want them all manny congrats
I loved sailor moon too!
They are beautiful!!
I think you did something boo 😏
Nice try sweetie, try again
Manny, serious question! How long will the discounts on your new highlighters be available? I want, I need, but momma has to wait for payday. Stupid taxes got me this paycheck.
I cant even lie they look amazing
Hi! Im new. Just found you. And subscribed. U r so funny. Definitely my kind of humor. Ive been binge watching your videos lol. Can't wait to try lunar beauty. Love you Manny!
Wendy v oh my god yes!!!😁😊😊😊
I love the undertones! They seem very versatile for different skin tones 🌷
I was sailor moon for halloween 2018💖
Packaging beautiful! I’m sure he going to sale out all due to the packaging
You really slayed this formula
Those swatches tho!🥰
I'm excited!! 🙆
Your so beautiful
Wow that looks amazing
Kinda sucks that you show us the combo that you love... so you're telling me to get the look that you have I need to buy 2 and layer them? So I need to spend 60 dollars on 2 highlighters to get the look that you do?? That is some bs
Awesome packaging !!!
The packaging looks so beautiful! Will you be at Drag Con?! It would be awesome if you were to sell your make up at Drag con too :)
Fenty beauty da who?
They look beautiful 💝
"true gold" uhhhhhh honey?? but the packaging is SICKENING !!!!!
These look absolutely beautiful!
Loving your ideas! Keep it going!!
Ahhhhhhhhh!!! I just died of happiness 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 must have them all
I own pearl from Becca, what's the difference between that and mercury?
You have 4.8 million subscribers yet only 300k have seen this video 🌚
omg manny they litterally look wet -
That packaging!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
okay love the packaging yess
Congrats Manny 💖
OMG! I was refreshing YouTube to see this video. Love from Mexico! ♥️♥️♥️
Gotta admit they look preeeetty good
I will deff be buying the lightest one. I was going to buy the highlighter palette but I couldn’t use most of the shades. So I’m excited for this one.
Congratulations Manny 😊
same week as Jeffreys powder reveal hmmm
Sailor moon fan 🙋🏽‍♀️ Have you seen sailor moon crystal?
OMG QUALITY AND YOUR MAKEUP RN ARE ON POOOOINNNTTT
Mercury is gorg 🥰👻
Not a single negative comment 🤐
😍😍😍😍 Total Sailor Moon vibes...i LOVE!!!! ❤🌜❤🌜😍😍😍😍
I dont wear makeup but im totally going to get this
I LOVE the packaging
So you pretty much tweaked the ferry package and call this original ?
Shame
O love it many people are very un fair he is not coping no one it beautiful
I will set up my alarm because I need it!!! Congratulations!! You’re amazing 😱🥰❤️
The packaging looks amazing
I love you Manny ❤️
I'm gonna need this is for no other reason than the packaging!
Unique packaging love it ❤️
$26? Thats super high..it will be over $30 when tax and shipping hit and it’s only one shade! Omg, its way too much. Lunar Beauty isnt even an established brand so how can you charge that much?! Pass...sorry.
Beautiful!!! I’m purchasing 💕
Ahhhhhh I want them all 💕💕💕✨✨
I am so excited for these
Are you going to bring back your lip bundle for lunar beauty. I would love to buy it even if it’s not in the original packaging I’d totally buy it.
Very nice...love the packaging but I have to tell you...it's NOT holographic. Iridescent would be the correct description.
I just ordered the shade Mars. So looking forward to receiving this. I purchased the greek goddess color pallet and it's a shame for those that have slept on that one. It's been my most worn pallet since I got it. I would love to see him release single shades for athena, clio, hestia and selene!
😍 Inlove with the ‘Venus’ shade!
I just bought 2 of them and I wasn’t offered the 15% off and had to pay full price 😔
Congratulations Manny! I am so proud of you! I am so sick of hearing ppl that come out with a product for their line is copying  from J🌟  they are beautiful like you MANNY!
They are so perfect and shiny I for sure am picking up one ❤️😍❤️ so can’t wait to do a video for my channel of my first impressions 😍😍
I don’t think that’s holo, but might be the lighting...... CRISTINE!!! You gotta check this out ! But the packaging is so cute
Too small for $26!
These look beautiful!
The packaging 😍
It’s so cute to see how nervous/ excited you are!!! You literally sold me with the packaging & how much you genuinely love the product yourself.
Looks like it's from Claire's but it's cute.
Lemme hurry up and buy this before Naoko Takeuchi sues
the pacKAGINGGGGGHHHHH T_T
I NEED Venus!!
So you mean to tell me that all 4 of these bundled will still come out to $83, PLUS shipping fees? Sis, you can literally buy a high end highlighter palette for half the price of this.
These products are just absolutely stunning. Fantastic job!!! Can’t wait to get my hands on Venus. It’s to die, to die!!
You’re awesome manny 💚
After trying the Greek Goddess highlighters I’m DEFINITELY buying these!!!  I’m super excited!!!. 💖😱😍😍😍
Will these be on Beautybay?
Manny will the highlighters also become available on beautybay? I was waiting for the greek goddess collection to be sold at beautybay but they never came 😭. Please think about your overseas customers as well❤️
You look great manny
so proud of you bb!!!!
I just love the names of his makeup
It’s based on a moon appearance but you name it after planets lmao - name it after the planet’s moons!!
That packaging though 🤤
This packaging is killer! Please do more like this
That packaging is amazing!!!!
Omfg Venus looks amazing
MOON PRISM POWER,  MAKE UP ❤!🌙
Love love loving these. Question Though, how come the weights are different? I was hoping you'd say something about that in the video but I didnt hear anything. No hate I love these and you did amazing (:
well damn guess i'm sold
Mercury 😍
These look gorgeous
They should be $18 max. You are not an established brand, people are already disinterested in your products and brand as evidenced by the fact your product release video got half as many views as your normal videos do. If you want to last and grow, you should definitely consider lowering your price points at least if/until your personal and business brands get back to what they used to be.
Beautiful packaging
These are lovely. Well done Manny x
Whoa I’m so surprised that light shade actually looks light enough for me I’m very fair and it’s kinda hard to find highlights that don’t leave a darker cast on me I’m excited for this thank you manny babe💕💖❤️
Gorgeous 🙊
Can't wait to try out the products! Creative packaging, love it!
😮 gorgeous 🥰
sis,,, this packaging is so cute but you must have slept through science class, because the moon is seriously dark and black?? it is def not as pretty as your moon
1.6k thumbs down... ouch
Soooooooooo Beautiful😍😍😍
OMG!! Sailor Moon was the first thing I thought of!! Just for that fact these are so mine!! Lol love!! Sailor Saturn is the bomb!!
Hi. Congrats on the new highlighters, the packaging is special and dope. Can you please tell me what eyeshadows you’re wearing on your eyes? It’s really pretty. Thanks!
Congrats Manny! Yaaaaaasssss!
And you ruined sailor moom for me...
These products look beautiful & the packaging THE HOUSEEEE
You need to restock your lipsticks ninno!! lol
I AM A SAILOR MOOD FAN
Me encanta sailor moon y que padre que sea tu inspiración para tus productos...love it
Stunning 💎🌛
It looks like bootleg fenty. So sad to see how messy this video was
The packaging 😭
Hmmmmmmm component shape reminds me of Fenty
very sailor Moon, cute
Can u plz send me 2 out of it
Love Sailor Moon...❤️❤️ hate your highlighters ... 😒😒
Looks exactly like xthuyle beauty room
Sailor moon!!!! 😍😍😍😍✨
I'm all about the Venus!!!!!
How much do u love the new sailor moon manny!! So awesome x
I’m OBSESSED WITH THE MARS POWDER!!!!!! I wore it today for the first time and after applying to the high points of my face I spritzed my beauty sponge with Fix + & gently pressed over the highlight, it melted right into my skin looking like it was a part of my actual skin. Aghhh! I don’t know if that made sense but it was really gorg! The most
beautiful highlight I’ve used to date.
This packaging is everything.
Component is gorgeoussss
Sooo pretty 😍😍😍
i'll take an apple from the closer tree and put it out in 1million dollars wtf?
That packaging is so stunning. Looks amazing 💘💘💘💘💘
I’m just not with a whole ass brand getting all its inspiration from sailor moon and it being ok like moon prism powders really
Is there a way to get these in Europe? I thought they'd be on Beautybay but I can't find his brand there anymore?
Hold up, is the moon holo?
That packaging !!!! 🤩
R u the concealer Robbery mastermind?
These look gorgeous!
OMG packaging!
gemme dat!! i love the packaging!
The brightness turns back up at 4:20 😏 how convenient
the packaging just looks dull, looks obvious that it is just plastic. 4 shades? Come on now. Yeah it's a new launch but that's no excuse either go big or go home i think.
Where is sailor moon highlight
Where did your moon necklace go?🌙
theyre sooo stunning
😍😍👌💯
I want to be as pretty as Manny! 😭❤️
These are STUNNING!!!!!!!!😱😍
you ruined sailor moon for me T^T
في احد من العرب 🙄☺
As someone who worked at claires, this looks like something they would sell there 🙄
I hope somebody or even you, Manny, will read this. I could find anywhere the information if this product is vegan, neither on the homepage, at beautybay, here or on the IG account. Does it contain animal derivated products or by-products?
That's amazing!
Beautiful, Manny!
Why are they all different net weights? 🤔
Tbh it’s little pricey manny and it’s nothing we haven’t seen. I wouldn’t buy it. Boring and meh.
The component really is pretty. Definite sailor moon vibes and I like how they are named after the planet's.
Chris Jenner Hair . I keep seeing her now😬
Manny!! Please test indonesia makeup♥️
OMG I want it!
Everybody and their mom is making highlighters 🙄
I’m excited idc what anyone says 🤷🏽‍♀️ I fuck with the packaging and I LOVE the Sailor Moon reference so I will definitely be buying a few 👌🏽
Sailor moon for liffffeeeeee
I would love Mars & Jupiter 🌙
Do you own a company? Is it your brand? Just need clarification of that. 😂😂😂
lol hes still making videos
Congratulations!
Sailor moon vibes
Everyone needs ANOTHER high lighter 😒😒😒😒
So proud of you !! They are stunning 👏🏼👏🏼🥰🥰🥰
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
i’m so proud!!!! 😍
You say you can see the product through the component, but if there's a mirror there, how can you see the product through it??
Oh Manny, the packaging..spectacular...omg..make this your signature! its amazing..and beautiful..we can all tell you made it with love..gorgeous! Cant Wait!
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Oh my. Oh yes.

Can not waiit!!!! @mannymua733 ♡♡♡
Venus!!!!!!!! So beautiful. Jupiter will be fun for summer when I have a bit of a tan.
Love you manny!! 💕
Not even a sub and only here for the entertainment. I’d rather buy Morphe’s dry as hell foundation as a highlighter then this crap. Not today sis.
I feel like mars isn’t peachy, it looks like it in the pan but isn’t on skin. I wish you would of tried the gold one in your face :(
Bomb 💣 gnna pick up
Ugh I love you ❤️
I don’t like how your name is based off sailor moon or from her🙄 I get your a sailor moon fan but I just feel like with your own brand you should be able to make up your own names for your makeup 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Where can we find any of your stuff?  Iam new to the makeup lines so iam wanting to try new products
Can’t wait to see you do a look where you use these on the eyes as well!
i love it!!
They are so beautiful !!!!
NO ONE CARES!!!!!!!!!
I need Mars for my wedding day!!!!
the packaging is everything
sooooo proud of you!! good luck
YEAA MANNNY :)

I'm loving all the shades and that there made in America. But how are they on mature skin? I'm in my 50s and I need something for mature skin
I need Venus ASAP
YESSS 😍
Did anyone notice manny Wasn’t as joyful in this video?
He’s so annoying
Those look sick!! I’m excited!
Good for you!!
It’s called “Moon Prism Powder,” but they’re named after planets...
i want mars too 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Pretty, but who actually pays that much for highlighter when you can get amazing ones for half the price or less? Seems like all the "gurus" stuff is costly.
Greek Goddess needs to be on Beauty Bay!!!!
OMG!!! They look so beautiful. Great job! I can definitely do the mercury. 💕
♡
I want mercury
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Omg I’m so excited!
If I wasn’t broke I would get Mars 😭
Hope I get to try these 💗
I freaking love sailor moon 🌙!!!! Dressed up as her for halloween as a kid in the 90s lol still buy sailor moon stuff now at 27 😆 deff getting one or two mayb 3 of these
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Need video on this look
i’m def gonna buy one!:)
The packaging is so cool
I love how the comments have been monitored to keep any sort of criticism away. Not very transparent, are we Manuel?
Please pass away
This looks beautiful manny! I’m so happy you are back and rising from everything that’s happened. This product is unique and so on brand for you!
Not gonna lie those look good
How the hell are you going to see the highlighter "through" the top since the mirror is the same size as the product and above the actual product...SMH.
Hmmm sailormoon? Still gonnaa go with JSC which is the real creator of uniqueness...
He blinks weird
Sailor moon lovers yaaaasssss!!!
😻✨
Very pretty, reminds me of large opals. Congratulations Manny.
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Love them all
Wow they look bomb af !!
Ugh I want!!come to the UK
Popsocket has left the chat
Looks cheap as hell but this comment is going to get deleted anyways ..
Proud of you, boo
Ahhh sailor moon!
not gonna lie the packaging and the component itself is cute af i can’t get over it
i am sick of you using the word " literally" do you read ?
gurl stop this already, sorry but you've already lost your house and you should start investing in something else because your brand is busted the house
They look so pretty
The formula looks so goood
I’m way too excited 😭😭😭
You should do a nude line ahahahaha
I’m sorry but that packaging like box is so much extra waste... mate help the environment.. not including 3 things of waste you could help change the world
Will it be IN Morphe stores?
🌙 fan here!
I'm shocked at the  price and not in good way and we can get better highliters at drug store also why is weight dif from each other and shocked that you still get good comments.
Uhm highlighters again? Can u do something else?
Anyone know what lashes he is wearing??
Anyone that tried his Greek goddess collection think it's worth it? What formula is comparable?? I love the abh amrezy. How similar would you say it is?
I am getting fenty vibes
Congrats doll I can’t wait to try!!
Good luck..!!!!
Yessss
I love sailor moon
I love venus !!!!
Is that a peach blue
OMGGGG
Gorgeous!!!!!!!!!
That is the PRETTIEST compact I have ever seen in my life. I’m a cancer so my sign is the moon and I love EVERYTHING moon related and it looks just like a moonstone and I’m obsessed.
Nice shirt!
I would totally buy these.
I love it!
Beauty !!
Where do we get these?
😍🌚
PROUD❤️
ITS IRIDESCENT NOT HOLOOOO
Beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I’m here for it fam!
Put makeup on your tattoo
How much product is in the pan?..youve neglected to mention the weight..instead focusing on component. They look small for that price imo.
My absolute favorite thing about lunar beauty is that manny isn’t afraid to try new things and takes criticism beautifully. No one wants to “fail” but he is willing to put something out and see if we love it!!!!!!! And every one of his products are amazing!
Love you Manny!!!!
I really really wanna know what lashes are you wearing???????
WOW. Like woooow! It’s sooo pretty!!! 😱😱😱
copper eye nude lip
GORGEOUS
Manny these are stunning ! You did such a great job love❤️
I’m excited I’m getting 2 for sure love package keep killing it love you
Ok, first congrats on the price point with it being made in the US! Next, HUGE Sailor Moon fan here! Thank you from all of us! You did it!!! Congrats again! Finally, I don't buy makeup all the time but I am going to be checking out Jupiter and Venus asap!!
Ariana Grande Moonlight!

If you ever launch in a store , launch at Riley rose !!!!!!!!!!!!

Wow!!! They look sooooooo sick!!!! Congratulations!!!!
The colors are beautiful as so is the packaging. I’m not a highlighting person really but if I was I could totally see adding them to my makeup.
Beautiful.
Mars omg😍😍😍😍😍
your face is ...... S N A T C H E D !
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Your sooo hot
Please please please come out with a Medusa highlight single! It’s the most incredible highlight I’ve ever used! It’s so perfect! It sucks having to buy a whole highlight palette for one color. The rest don’t work with my skin tone 😢
😍😍😍😍
So so so Happy for you. Thanx for being you 😄 I always have a better day when I can watch your videos ❣️
This is so beautiful 😍 I can’t wait to buy them!!!
I am living for this. I am a huge Sailor Moon fan and this is a must have 😍😍 need to add it to my Lunar Beauty Fam that i already own.

So proud of you Manny! ❤️
Congrats!!!! ❤️
I'd get this just for the packaging
Girl I neeeeeeeddd!! 💜
The colors and the packaging is absolutely on point!!!! Haven’t bought any highlighters since the Jaclyn collect with Becca. I will absolutely buy 2 of the four you are selling for this collection :). Bravo 👏🏼 .
Beautiful,  good job Manny
His shirt is giving me night at the Roxbury vibes
Let me start off with saying Lunar Beauty is the best each item you buy from Lunar Beauty will not let you down.  I have the Life is a Drag, and the goddess collection .  Omg I don’t even have to try to blend takes me less than a min to blend.. the highlighting is bomb.
Ready to support you!!! Never stop!!! Never!!!!
Congratulations!
BEAUTIFUL!
Packaging is cool, kinda looks like my popsocket on my phone definitely gonna have to get the peachy Sade
Those would make awesome eyeshadow aswelll.
💜💜💜
👍
Sailor Moon fan here!!! Love it!!! Packaging looks like the scale from Dragon Tales that takes them to Dragon Land!! 😍😍😍😍😍

Why didn't you name them after the different moons in the solar system lol
I'm so glad the lightest shade doesnt have a pink or purple shift like 90 percent of white shades!! Its so hard to find a light highlight like that! Thank you!!
Why do they all weigh different weights, are they all different amounts of product.
But is it REAL holo?
Egh Just ok
Fffff I want all the 3 shades 😭😭😭 will you sell your lipgloss on beautybay ? PLEASE I really wanted to try it so bad please please sell it on beautybay !!
Greek goddess highlighters are some of my fav! So excited for these 🤩 That packaging though... Im dead 💀

Whoa🤤 I'm so excited. This will actually be the first highlighter I have EVER bought. Im so excited!
Daaaaaaaamn and literally just the other day I told myself I'm good with my highlighter collection, now I need 4 more! Breathtaking I can't wait to show it off. Like literally I will not apply highlighter inside the house, I'll wait till I'm lunching with my girl friends then pull it out lol. Congrats Manny!

I'm not much for highlighters but I think I'm going to need to cop that Venus shade. O_O
Love the packaging. Neutral but funky. Not cheap looking. Sleek but unique. It's just bomb.
Most hurting thing is when you cant buy such mesmerising t

Blinding
Meh..
YOUR PACKAGING LOOKS LIKE A GUSHER!!!!!!

Over the moon hyped about the packaging! 😍 

see what I did  lol
Thank you thank you thank you 😭😭😭 I can't wait to get my hands on one! #WeeabooForLife
Omg!!! I love this !! 
I’m so i love with your brand and haven’t even bought a product yet . I will defiantly will be purchasing !!
The package alone !!!!! From the box moon theme it’s so creative and ugh I’m amazed by this whole thing
I feel like you might get a cease and desist from the sailor moon team 🤔
Just stunning 😍😍 Glow on babe 😘
Yasss love all the shades! So proud of you manny! Can’t wait to buy some !!🌙
I love how you swatched them like that!
Omggg  THE PACKAGING 😭😭 I LIVEEEEEEEEE
Yssss manny 😍😍😍😍
I was hoping for the colors of the sailor scouts.
I actually think all those colors would go amazing on every skin tone. It just depends what color powder you want :)
ICONIC OMGGGGG
I love the dragon tale stone vibe, I just wish I could feel the weight because it seems like it would be light, plastic and cheap feeling. Not gonna spend $26 on a cheap feeling thing.
LOVE the packaging!
It looks like the dragon tales stone!!
Mars and Venus added to cart lol
Mars is a nice rose gold color, it’s real pretty!
😶
So happy for you!!! The highlighters are GORGEOUS😍 Congrats!! Love you tha most Manny❤❤❤
Love them! Congrats! Your makeup is gorgeous today! 😍
this is so pretty and I love them 😍 💛🌟🖤 I’m so proud of you manny !!
I CANT WAIT TO PURCHASE! Manny is def exotic and different with his products I live for it!😍
Yesss I’m about to be blinded I love Sailor moon 🌙 and they are stunning yesss ❤️🥰🥰I need them
Manny,I just love your little giggle..it makes me laugh every time- Yall know the drill with that lol Love You
Congratulations!!! I cant wait to try them!
I love your look in this video!
Omg I can’t wait. I want this 🥰
I’ve been a major sailor moon fan since I could remember so when I say that the actual makeup doesn’t remind me of sailor moon at all. Sorry
Packaging is cute 🤩
if thats not fenty beauty.....
Yes I am
Cute packaging!
I like them
❤️❤️❤️💎💎💎😉love it!!
Me encanto!!!! Ya quiero que salgan!!
Boring the haus down boots
OMG BUT THAT FCKING PACKAGING KINDA FCKING NEEEEED ONE BTCHHHH
your not really good at using words are you? very repetitive
FOR THE THRONE OR FOR THE TRASH?! WHATS THE TEA?!?!?!?
Would love a full view of your makeup organizer storage behind you lol !!!!!!! <3 Xoxoxox Happy Birthday btw mine is Today!! :)
Ok but like I just want the brushes cause who doesn’t want there own miniature Jon Snow Sword?! Or little baby Needle?! Like seriously I would run around the house with them just screaming “For WINTERFELL” 😂
You know what killed me (besides the Red Wedding)... HOLD THE DOOR.
they should've named the lip stain "The Long Farewell"
Honestly Urban Decay better do a Stranger Things collection. THAT WOULD KILL ME OMG
We need 
1) makeup storage detailed tour
2) beauty room tour
3) any footage you have decluttering your makeup. 
4) please and thank you. 
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Finally a beauty guru who actually watches the show and know the names, lol.
"i am Shookira " 😂love from San Antonio Texas 💜💜
Kinda wish the eyeshadow palette had a lid over the actual palette so you could take it out of the bulky outer packaging for travel. Other than that the collection looks awesome.
Jon Snow 💯💯💯💯💯💯 10/10 gorgeous sexy beautiful seductive innocent gorgeous beautiful man.
I love the storage as a background
 Feels more real 😊
The fly swap is EVERYTHING!! 🤣🤣
I’m LIVING for your background/ new makeup storage we NEED a new beauty room setup video or makeup storage video 😍😩💓💓
And i love how you throw in some spanish words. Rep that Latin Status!
"Too big, great collectors piece though." "Powdery, but great collectors piece." "Expensive, over-priced, but it's a collectors piece so..."

Long story short, don't bother if you're looking for some practical makeup to use. If you're into makeup and GoT, you might want it. But really, everything here is so over-priced and underwhelming that I'm just like 🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷
Look at that makeup shelf/organizer in the background! Love it. Looks great.
You look fab Manny....great look. Thanks for such a detailed  and honest review! 🥰
I've never watched it.  But I feel like it's a show I would like.
Love GoT! Beautiful collection! Love all character, but Arya Stark and Denareys is so savage 😎
Omg please do the Ulta + Avengers collab collection next!!!
I tell anyone who hasn't watched GOT to get to the red wedding at least, and if they're not invested by that time, then it's not the show for them 🤷🏻‍♀️ My friend got through season one and said it was too boring to keep watching 😭😭😭
I think GREEK GODDESS from Lunar beauty still my favorite 😍👍🏻
manny , I freaking love you so much. Your videos make me so happy and I liveee for your personality cause you make me laugh so much. Keep doing you queennn 💖💖
Who is/was your favorite character? Mine was Petyr Baelish and Sandor Clegane
What one person can use all three of those highlighters? I wish they sold those separately
Omg the red wedding had me CRYING!!!!! Gosh that was emotional-wise the worst episode for me (so far; then Yigrette rip was also a horribly sad moment)
The Red Wedding.... My mouth was hanging open, I was holding onto my pillow so tight and crying my eyes out. I was not ready. I read the books so I knew it was coming but I was not ready 😢😢

Tyrion is my favorite character for sure! 😍 Love you Manny! Your make-up is stunning 😍
Had me rolling hard af when the damn fly flew into frame. Your face!
Ayeee HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVE YOU!!🐲🐲🐲 (only the VIP snap squad understands)😎🖤
“I just wanna slap my face so hard just to feel something”
feel that on a personal level 
😂😂😂
GOT, is the best show ever!!!
The red wedding almost did me in for reals!! But I also wanted Oberyn to beat the Mountain. 
I think I want everything but mostly cause its GOT.
You made me laugh when you swung at that fly in the beginning.🤣🤣🤣loving the black neck sheer sweater lace up*💕💕💕😍
Manny: This higlighter is creamy 
Me: wow gotta get this cause i had few urban decay highlighter which looked so powdery
Also manny: This is kinda powdery but it doesnt affect me
Even though I'm an over 40 fan, I can't stop watching your videos!  I listen to you on the way to and from work and watch you as I'm working out (making my time go by much faster, laughing on the treadmill while others wonder what's wrong with me😂).  I just about died when I bought the last of the Morphe M438 to set my under eye! My daughter thought I was crazy at how excited I got about buying your go to brush right there in the middle of Ulta! Your tips and tricks have given me the confidence to really bump up my makeup routine after all these years and be the most beautiful version of me I can achieve! ❤️
Keep on being positive, funny and informative! You are beautiful inside and out! 🥰

Sidenote: Tyrion Lannister is my favorite....cracks me the f#@k up! Love GOT!
What I love about manny is that he is naturally funny, not forcing to be hilarious to the point that people won't be taking him seriously like other male beauty gurus. Feels like your just talking to your besties if that makes sense lol! Love him xoxo!
The four stand alone colours that are separate in the eye shadow palette can be used alone as eye shadows OR as highlighters AND you can mix them to make a new duo chrome highlighter and eye shadow. 

That’s what urban decay told me. No one has mentioned this in the tutorials Iv watched xx
I just ADORE you please don't ever change😘
Oh my GOT lmfao that killed me!!! And I LOVE GOT! My favorite show hands down.. the chilling adventures of Sabrina 🖤🖤 love you Manny!!!!
My favorite character has always been and will always be Tyrion! I love him so damn much!
But, this background is stunning. Love it!
GOT is my ultimate favorite show! I'm going to be so sad after this season!
❤️ this!!!  I love GOT. I’ve been watching since day 1.
IM SO EXCITED FOR GOT TO COME BACK!!! Love the show and love you!!!!!
Girl!!.. the red wedding had me rethinking my life for real..lol
Possibly the only one that’s never watched game of thrones 🤭😂 Love you Manny ❤️❤️
I bent the knee, my elbows and my toes 🤣🤣🤣 God you are so funny 😆 great video 💪🏼 we are all waiting for the new season ❤️ happy to know you are a fan of GOT too 😍
I truly enjoyed your review! My favorite character would have to be John Snow 🤗
I love whenever you upload a new video😍😍gorgeous as always manny
Love the look and the collection! Setting an alarm and praying I get my hands on the boxset before it sells out. GOT + UD fan of both from day one. Ty for an honest and entertaining review! ❤️💕 PS. MOTHER OF DRAGONS IS THE BEST- 👩🐉💕
I liked this vid at 1.20 . You are so funny 😂. Love your personality. I have nothing but love 💗 for Urban Decay. Also love GoT!!!! 🐉🐉🐉
I LOVE this video. Loved the products, obvi love the presentation, and love you manny!
Manny!! I have GOT on my list of shows to binge watch..... just gotta do it 💕💕💋
I always in joy watching your videos they always make my day ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just wanna slap my face so hard.. just to feel something. 😂😂😂😂😂 I’m done, that hit too close to home Hahahha
The eyeshadow palette and the highlighter palette should have been spilt but also made available like this for those who like it as a collectors item... it would have been more user friendly and affordable.

And... I don’t watch GOT 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Now that is what I call an excellent review! Also I liked how you explained that everyone defines expensive differently and just in general did I like how honest you were! Valar Morghulis
Manny, You totally Mr. Miyagi-ed that fly...damn it looked as big as a bat 🦇 😱That SLAP thou!? Lmao 😂🤣😭💀

P.S. I would love to see how you built your customized closet/ makeup room 😘❤️
Sickening 😍

“They glide like a buttery crispy flake”

Love you boo

Feliz cumpleaños Bonito! 
A mi me encanta UD y GOT!!! 😊😊😊😊

Definitely love the collection and urban decay laid it deown!!  Please do a video on your beautiful Ikea storage unit too😉

You should have done one side Lannister and one side Winterfell, but I digress...I love GOT and love you too <3
You are so amazing! I've been going thru ALOT lately, and watching your videos makes me laugh and helps take my mind off things. Stay awesome! 🙂💜
Literally can we be best friends! You make me laugh so much lmaoo! You through your inner chola in everything I literally live for it!
Lllllrrrreeeeegggggrrrrrton”....gurl!!!! dead ☠️☠️☠️🐉🐉🐉

You roll your dragon names...I live!!! 🤗😂
I lost it when you said buttery crispy flake!!
I don't watch GOT 🙈 but I'm LOVING this look Manny! STUNNING!
Love GOT! I’ve watched all the season a few times! Love this collection 😍 The PR packaging is awesome 👏🏻
God damn so glad you're my first tutorial and review I watched 😂😂😘😘 I am so obsessed with GOT... I am not ready for it to end 😭
The $36 for the highlight isn’t that bad though? $12 per highlighter and then packaging and GOT  collaboration.  

Eyeshadow On the other hand is def a collectors piece though. I was thinking with all the pop up iron throne it would be the more expensive of everything

As for me I personally am not a Game of Thrones fan  and I do have the first season on DVD.  I simply couldn’t get into it but most of the people I know are super into it lol.  I love Outlander though
why are you so entertaining, humble, and down to earth, i’m literally obsessed w you. you’re in my top 5 fav youtubers without a DOUBT. ugh i love you so much manny, keep up the great content 💗
For the throne for sure! I enjoyed this video Manny, thank you!
You are literally the best. I always have such an amazing time watching your channel. I love you Manny!
I liked the video and commented before I even watched it because i know I'll love it no matter what! 🤘🏼🥰
I will buy those brushes!!!! N I will not use them either lol super cute Game of Thrones is my life watched over n over n even again in Spanish 🤣
Omg!! The red wedding KILLED and SHATTERED me into pieces.
I never got the notification for this so here I am a week later
Omg i love you. New subscriber here. Got the pallatte for mothers day. I love it so far. I was looking for a review stumbled on you and omg you are amazing. You made me laugh. Game of thrones is life right now. Thanks for the smiles today
Lmao what is a “buttery crispy flake” 😹😹 Man, ily
Heyy can you do a makeup video with your british accent???
HAHAHA "I bent the knee, the elbow, and my toes" omg. lol!
Get it together sansa! Haha. Love when you speak in spanish 🤗
Omg Manny! Congrats on your new home! I love your videos
Love game of thrones books tv show is good makeup is so so underwhelming
Im livin for the collection cause its GOT but its a ridiculous price point💯 I dont like the stain,the Lipsticks or the pallete( your look was gorgeous....I dont think its worth it for only 3 mattes)....the liners and highlighters are what Id personally buy💯
my favorite character in GOT is Tyrion by far!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY RAVEN!! That's all I think of anytime anyone mentions a birthday😂
Manny I love you so much! But....

I've never seen game of thrones!

There, I said it
Shook-quiche 🤣🤣🤣🤣👌🏻💯💯 love it Manny!!!
Happy birthday beautiful soul 🎂🎉🎈🎉🎉 hope you get some rest. Feliz cumple
Come on f***ing your sister.....😳

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Red Wedding made me cry. Robb 💔 I refused to watch after but I gave in because I hated not knowing. I loveeeeeeee Daenerys!! I live for her!
Beautiful collection. The Look IS Gorgeous on YOU.
And yes I personally sat in front of my tv for 15 minutes after the red wedding episode ended... like 😟😟😟😟😟tf just happened!?
Manny getting me through the long night with GOT makeup! Yassss!
I literally dropped everything that I was doing. Saw two of my favorites on YouTube, Manny and Games of Thrones!! ❤ I need that palette and highlight palette. 😍🐺🦌🐲❄🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Love you bunches...n yus...I will watch this but boo I'm over this collection already too reviewed

I don’t even watch Game of Thrones but I’m definitely going to watch all of this.. because, well, Manny. And I live!
This look turned out amazing😍❤😘
GoT is LIIIIFEE AND IM SO HYPE. That pop-up palette is so fun dude 💚 Love you Manny!! YES PLEASE DO A VID ON THE SHELVES AND COLLECTION 😍 I mean, I’d watch you brush you hair for 30 minutes sooooo 😅
Happy Birthday!!!🎂🎉You are literally amazing!
OMG how excited you are for the new season makes me so sad for future you!!

Living for your new background!!!

I have to say,  The Hound is my absolute favorite character
I want Lord Snow or Sansa to take the Throne. But I am all over blue right now.  ❤ Blue Blood.
Manny is the most entertaining YouTuber literally ever 😂 it takes a lot for me to laugh and he makes me laugh every vid 🤗
I love the makeup storage below!  Would love to snoop thru your collection 😁
Stunning! My favorite characters are Daenerys, Jon, Arya, Tyrion and khal Drogo (R.I.P) - just because it's Jason Mamoa! 😍
🐲🐲🐲🐲 I love that my two favorite things came together- GAME OF THRONES AND MAKEUPPPP 💕
I loved game of thrones but I lost my history when I switched cable companies so I didn't know what episode I was on so i stopped watching 🖤😭
I love your makeup wall..that is so cool. I am a fan of UD, that was the first makeup brand I bought...that got me started. I LOVE their liners, my ultimate favorite. Always love your videos 💖💖
Yes to how you came up with plan for storage and building it
You are so funny!! I can totally  relate to the silly noises you make to add umph to what your saying or doing 😂😂😂
You crease me up
Will definitely be buying this line for the GoT name and not the quality lol.
FOR THE THRONE GUURL🤩🤩🤩🤩 OOOH GOT I LOVE THEM ALL! The brushes???? Like WHAAAAT??? I will definitely buy them... especially the highlighter pallet, the liners and the brushes!!! So cool to have them. I liked the pallet , but it did not impress me, you know? The mattes were very few... but over all it was not bad at all. Loooove you MANNYYY🤩❤🇬🇷
You are seriously the cutest person ever! Looove your makeup😍
OMG I want your storage. it is gorgeous! also, Happy Belated Birthday!!!!!!
Only a minute in to the vid and PRAYING this collection is good Cos GoT x makeup is all I’ve ever wanted in life😭😭😭

Never watched game of thrones but I will if there's makeup involved 😁
I love you manny  mua💋 so much love from philippines 🇵🇭
I legitimately am a die hard fan of GOT...also the noise they came up with for the dragons blowing fire is the greatest thing I’ve ever heard it gives me goosebumps 🙌🏼
Manny I know we haven’t met in person but we’ve been best friends for two years now and irrr is what irrrrr is! love youuuhh
Omg I loooooove it!! Not excited for the prices tho!  I wanted the eyeshadow pallet but  not for $65!  Eyeliners and lipstick for sure! Jon Snow is my #1!!😍
Never even seen it...

I'm here for Manny... 😏
<3 love your videos, i try to do my makeup like yours compare to every other MUA :)
I’m a huge huge got fan and intend to buy the pallet for a collectors item.
My favourite two characters 
Miss stormborn obvs 
And
Bron because he’s so so funny!! 
We get it April 15th in the uk and me and my husband are having a got day! We’ve got a countdown pegboard 😂😂 literally can’t wait!!!
Because when a thing gets hyped so much i end up hating it! If that makes sense to anyone 😂
I'm laughing in the intro. This about to be the best day ever
Hermoso! Looking bomb as usual!
Sending love from houston 🖤🤗!
I think the fly is coming for the the highlighter he needs a glow up
I actually really wanna know like everything your gonna do to your house 😭
First time on your channel. LOVING you and this collection! 🐴🗡🐉🖤
Manny's mood in this video is a Mood.😂 Ilysm Manny 😂❤️
I am GAGGING at the colors, the lips, and the SHIRT YOUR WEARING! 

But in all honesty I am deceased at this collection.
Please review the bea milani stick foundation and their new concealer  please ❤❤❤
I'm literally married to a Lady Stark haha 😀 My wife's last name is Stark and she loves Game of Thrones!!!
LOVE Game Of Thrones! Love this collection!  Love you! 😘
You literally give me an asthma attack every time I watch your videos! AND I DONT EVEN HAVW ASTHMA! I looovveeee you ❤️😘
I’m a total GoT nerd. Cute products but a bit pricey. The packaging is dope, though.
lol I always watch videos with my captions on and it keeps translating “iron throne” as “iron thong” 😂😂
Happy belated birthday Manny!! 💕
I love game of thrones I can't wait for the new season! It's so good!
MY BIRTHDAY IT’S ON 6 APRIL TOO😱😭😭OMGGGGGGG😭😭😭😭💗💖💖💓💞🌸💓💖💕💞💓
All of these comments saying they’ve never seen GoT... ☹️ y’all are missing out! You should’ve just talked about what you wanted to! I’m so excited for this collection & season 8! 🤗 loved this review ♥️
Happy belated birthday 🎂🎈🎈🎈🎂🎉🎉🎉 I love you xoxo
I died from the fly away 😂💀💀
i HIGHkey want to hear manny say “no mames!” after he swatches a highligh
Dani is my girl! Loooove GOT.
Would love a video about the shelving unit in the background!!
As much as I love GOT now, when I first started watching it, I had a hard time watching it because it is way too gory.
I'm crying. when you caught how you pronounced tyrion
Belated happy birthday Manny! Good to see you happy and smiling. Keep it up and stay positive! I miss seeing you and Laura in some silly collabs! Please make one soon! 🇸🇽❤️🇺🇸🎉💋🌙💄
hi manny i 💜 u , and I literally was just deciding if I should start watching game of thrones 🐲🐲
Needed this to find out what to buy🙌🏽
You are freaking hilarious 🤣💕
Happy birthday I love watching your videos and I love ya thanks for everything you do you are a truly a inspiration
Funny thing is I haven’t seen Game of Thrones. 
Might be a shocker, but I love the look. I agree with the lipstick choices though overall yes the prices are out of my range, but it’s beautiful
Love game of thrones. This is my favorite review. I've  been waiting for it since I heard about the launch. Im glad they didn't relaease a hound or mountain item! Lol can you imagine. My favorite character besides Danny and Jon Snow (obviously) is Braun and Arya Stark
Amazing look 👀 Game of Thrones is amazing♥️ getting ready to watch it after the worst birthday ever!!
Tell us how you built the ikea set. I wannna see 😍
Fuuuuck manny, you should do more purple eye looks. Makes your green eyes pop! So beautiful 👌
I ❤️your shirt👍🏼and your make up storage is awesome
Manny, love your eyes! Can't figure out whether they are hazel or green but none the less I DO love them!!!
Yaasss do a vid of how you picked out the makeup organizers!
I love you manny!!!!! You da bestttt 😘🥰🥰🥰
Love GOT, Love this, Love You. Happy Birthday
I'm a HUGE fan of GOT. And Daenerys is my favorite character. She's STUNNING and daring and I love it. And her husband Khal, played by Jason Mamoa, is one sexy man!!😍😍 I do hate her brother though. He's quite a snob. I can't stand him. I even have quite a collection of GOT merch. I can't help it lol!! Anyways, huge fan. And happy birthday!!💖
That purple/ red eye look isn't my favorite,  but the shadows seem pretty good
Happy Birthday, Manny!😘🎉🥳
I really like you.
Be my boyfriend
I love that you did this...combining my love for beauty and GOT. I’m living for this! 🙌🏻
I like the story line but the gory stuff is so hard to watch, I struggle!
I love Game of Thrones!Happy Birthday Manny1🎈🎂🎁You are sweet and adorable.😍
Not a game of thrones fan, so I wouldn’t purchase any of the products. Highlighters seem like foils or eyeshadows. The pallete is all shimmers.. pass & the brushes are cool, but never been a fan of UD brushes.. so for me the collection is a no go 🙅🏽‍♂️ thanks for the review manny! 💗
If you love GoT, you have to watch The Last Kingdom!!! So good 😊
Also pleaseeee do the video where you show the building process!!!!!
omg its not a copper eye/nude lip lewk. lol
I’m ACTUALLY living for this eye look 🤩😍
Omg I'm in LOVE!! GoT is my favorite of all time I'm living!!!!
My favorite character on Game of Thrones is Sansa xD Also I adore the actress who plays her, Sophie Turner ❤️
Yes, detail out your makeup storage for us!
Game of thrones is the best show out there.  The red wedding still haunts me. I re watched and still got pissed when I watched it again.  I love that you love GOT as much as me!!!!
I actually started to watch Game Of Thrones with my parents
And it’s amazin! :D
🐲🐲🐲Game of Thrones dramatic, dragon fighting music, would have been awesome with the fly swat! You wielded a sword at it😂
MAJOR GOT FAN and a MAKEUP FAN-I love the show and the design and look of the show.
Tyrion is my favorite character! Loved all the details in this collection!
I just love Manny 💜 his videos just make me love life more 💜
Omg I want to watch GOT with you...you are freaking hilarious 😆
Sadly i cant watch GoT because hulu charges me extra to access it. Thats the only reason i dont watch it.
Also i need that lip stain but im not paying 26 bucks for it.
Yes!!!!! I live for GoT!!! I want this entire collection!!! Probably going to buy everything 😅😅😅 It’s my two favorite things combined: Game of Thrones & Makeup like how could I not???
never watched he game of thrones...I’ll probably watch now 😭😂
So I intentionally didn't watch the show until the final season was about to come out so I could watch it beginning to end. So I'm watching it now and I just finished up season 3 and it's so funny you talked about the red wedding because I literally just posted about that episode on my FB. I'm so mad lol. So many people are on my I want you to get murdered in a horrible way list at this point. Lol. And yes I Love The mother of dragons. Her and Jon snow are my faves 😍
I’m genuinely wondering, did manny just give up on lunar beauty?
Someone was really feeling Pirates of the Caribbean with that shirt! Lol 😂😂😂 ily
I caaaan't wait the last season 😍😍 Daenerys should be quueeen ! 😄😄
I enjoyed the first couple of seasons. As a book annoying nerd, I lost interest as soon as they drifted from the source.
That said... I still kinda want the whole collection there!
I'm with you on the Red Wedding. I was on a train when I read that part, and I didn't even realize that I was yelling at my book "NOOOOOO! WTF!!!" and everyone else was looking at me funny.
You are such a goof ball
Your awsome love ya
This eye look reminded me of the dragon from Shrek!!
FIRST!!!! Omg I’m so early and love ur videos manny u r so funny and relateable and my favorite thing you say is “eres what eres” and sometimes I spend so lon thinking of how it sounds like how u would stay the whole thing in English!!!!! Anyway love you manny!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love the way you never know what you’re talking about 🤣. You’re so silly! ❤️❤️
Finally someone that's seen every season and can pronounce the shadow names 😂 best review I've seen so far!
Beautiful Thank You For Sharing Beautiful
I’ve read and watched the book 1&2/seasons 1&2 and this was the second time I tried watching it. I’m still not a fan, there’s too many kingdoms but mostly it’s just too slow and dry. I love khaleesi but there’s not enough going on to hook me.... still trying to get through book 3
Yay! Perfect timing! I’m on my lunch break. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Love ya Manny! 😘
Biiitch, I love you ❤️😘
The red wedding changed me as a person. My heart shattered! Especially bc of Arya! I don't want to say more and ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it but I cry every time I watched it!
Manny have you seen the show "Schitts Creek"? You totally remind me of David from that show! Personality,look,sarcasm,everything! It's a good thing! Love you! ❤❤
Side note - the Red Wedding?? Girl. I was SO MAD. So mad. So MAAAAD!!!! Thank goodness our girl Arya handled her business!
When Joffery ordered his men to slaughter all of Robert's bastards. The brothel scene forever haunts me.. and also Hodors death 😭😭
I literally died and was sooooooo in shock during the red wedding I can't wait for it to start!!!!♥️😍😍
The Red Wedding was literally traumatic
Happy Birthday, Manny! BTW, I love your hair. It looks so silky and soft. Makes me want to run my fingers through it!
i love you manny !!! 🤩
Cape Town, South Africa 🌇
literally when you said i want to smack myself in the face just to feel something.....i felt that in the depths of my soul 😫
We need to see a New House Beauty Room Tour!!!!
I love you manny! I think you are so funny😂😂😂💞
I really want to watch GoT , I need the dvd box set as I can't get it on my TV
It looks good with just that as your background for filming. Your new house is so dope!!! You deserve it! 💜
Helllll no- no mean comments we love you!!!! I wish we could be friends in real life—— inbox me ;) lmao lmao
You’re literally the cutest human being ever. 🤩
I loved this video, you seem much more happy and excited, it seems that you were really enjoying what you were doing. Love youuuuuu
Yes I freaking love it ❤️
I'm SO GLAD YOU DID THIS REVIEW!!!!  

I clicked so hard, so fast!

Love from Glasgow!!

Also YES for the Jamie Genevieve shout out!!
Live for the final lewk!!
Manny!! I've come to La la love you!
Very honest opinions on this!! Thank you for that!! Love Game of Thrones!!! My boyfriend got me hooked on it!!! I would have to say Tryion is my favorite character!! Second is Arya!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m back to loving Manny again! I’m soooo glad you did this cool video. Like your honest real style. Bc you’re so talented.
Manny MUA and Game of Thrones my two favorite things 🥰
Manny can you do a video of a full face using your own product. Would like to see that!!!
I LOVE this look! I’m so excited for GOT and for urban decay to do a collaboration I just died. I want the palette and I think I’d use the stain for my lips. I love the eyeliners!
Liked and commented like you told me to 😂😂
I actually like the natural bckground better! For some reason, i can see the person much clearer! Anyone else feel tht way?
Tyrion, Arya, Khaleesi and Jon are my Favorites.
My friend yesterday said she just couldn’t get into GOT. She got all the way to the third season and still didn’t like it! She crazy! 

And yes to the red wedding! My husband and I are rewatching before the new season and rewatching all the insane scenes is killing me! lol.
I love how you just insert "pinche" randomly in whatever you're going to say lol
Hilarious 🖤🖤🖤
The Red Wedding had me up off my feet screaming "NOOOOOO!!" at the TV. :'(
Love the look. Stopped watching GOT because I was just tired of keeping up with ALL the storylines. You get into one and then it would be weeks before finding out what’s going on in a storyline because it had switched to another story.  Yes the Red Wedding killed me too!!!
I like your background so much!!! It looks so pretty
When he slapped the fly😭😭 i can't
Please do a makeup organizer tour! Would love to see how you designed it.
Lmfao that fly tho hahahah 🦟 the editing too is great everything about this is fucking awesome haha love ya 😍😂
Finally some who’s seen the show reviewing these products !!
The look is reminding me of the dragon in shrek but still love
Manny, I personally would love to see a skin care video. I am currently looking into more skin care lines and I love your videos, please help me and find the perfect skin care!
🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲 Inlove with this collaboration and, as always, inlove with your videos!!!
Manny your base makeup looks so good and smooth 👀 maybe an update on it ??
Yyaaaaas, go through your storage for us 😍
I love game of thrones it derailed from the books but the books are really good  have you read the books Manny really good reads and also the show surpassed the books at one point but also I love the show that red wedding shook me to the core and I was like omg why are you so dark and twisted I kept watching but yes plz read the books and tell us your thoughts 💭also manny I tried to get my bf to watch but the 1st season for a lot of people feel is boring or not fast enough after that it is very porn meets mid evil times meets action meets supernatural so I love 💕 it
I love thisssss so glad you did a review💕💕💕
I rewatched all the episodes again to make sure I’m ready 😂no shame
🐲🐲🐲😍😍😍 so excited about this. Canadian fan sending you good vibes and love Manny
I've never watched it because I'm in nursing school. Instead I'm here 🤗
Manny, so glad you did this video! Another YouTube did a review and is kind of more of a “too full and dramatic” glam, I was worried I wouldn’t be able to work with the palette myself. After watching you, I’ve got my confidence back lol
I literally laugh so hard everytime i watch one of your videos Manny!! That's what i love about you😊 you dont try to be funny, you are just hilarious naturally and you seem like you are just being yourself and that's what makes you so entertaining to watch and it's definitely what makes me trust you more so then other YouTubers! Love you Manny❤❤
BITCHHHHHH I NEED A VIDEO ON THE MAKEUP WALL CUZ THATS A NEED❤️
I love and will buy all of it. You did a very pretty look! Yes, from the very beginning I have been a GOT fan ! I will continue to be. Thank you for sharing with us!
Imma start following u only cause of this video 😭😭💕💕💕 i love game of thrones too
I am OBSESSED with GOT and Urban Decay so I’ve been so excited about this collection however I’m just not sure if I will be buying any now x Love you Tho x
Manny, you crack me up😂😂
I fucking love Game of Thrones. Can't wait for the final season.🙃🙃🙃🙃
No love for my man Stannis? Pass
I don’t think the pallet it worth it for the price point . You’re really just paying for the packaging , every time Manny says something wrong about it he says “ but..”
You asked if we can see the pink and I nodded yes lol I like pink highlighters but always prefer more of brown highlight just because of my skin town but once again loved your video 😘
I love  GOT! I’m a super fan actually! Best show ever.
Sooooooooo ready for GOT to start back up. I’ve been waiting for what feels like forever!!!
Love the brushes but a little pricey, please shave Manny just a suggestion 🤗. Love your videos you are hilarious 🤩
I would love to see a video of your new organization system
Am I the only person on the planet that has not even seen a preview for Game of Thrones? Literally nothing. Guess I'm under a rock 🤷‍♀️
If Danny doesn't get the throne imma b pissed
Manny I look forward to your bloopers every video!!! Yasss!!! 🐉🐉🐉 snap fam!
The Red wedding actually make me feel like crap 😭
I actually love the pink tinted highlighter on you better than the other one !
Looks really good. To expensive for me.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY... 🎂🎂🎂❤
When u have a whole essay to write but your here instead 😂

ps small youtuber 😊
Yasss review how you built that storage ! Love it
I am so obsessed with Game of Thrones, I named my dog Tormund bc I love him so much
Gonna get it!
I love you Manny and I love Jason Momoa from GOT
How did you build your closet?? Video  please!
Thank you so much for doing this video. I love love love game of thrones and was so excited when I saw this colab. However the price point is higher for me personally so this gave me an amazing idea of what I want to purchase. Thank you.
I love the GOT books. Was not thrilled with the show. I guess it's because the characters didn't look the same in my head as they do on screen. The acting is awesome, though. Arya and Dani are my favorite characters. Then Tyrion is a close 3rd.🥰
I want. I need. I must have! LOVE GOT!!! ❤
We need a make up stash tour Manny💜
Manny!!!!! You’re slaying it! I saw the PR release and thought “if Manny reviews this, then a girl will hook herself up.” Thank you!
I hope you had a great birthday I've been watching the marathon on HBO
I need this in my life! I love game of thrones!
Cersei Lannister all the way!! 😍😘😘
Its too gory to me but yet i can watch supernatural and I'm not into shows like game of thrones
Gave it a like and comment before the reviewing of the products lol
I cried at the end of Reigns of Castamere and then when the credits rolled...... complete silence! That got me good.
I can't even begin to explain how much I love Manny. I know you're gay, but please marry me 😭❤️
Yes please do a video on the new storage and how you organized everything! I love those vids 😱❤️ 
ALSO, can you do a video on the best everyday brushes to use that won’t break the bank? Or maybe on morphe brush sets vs buying them separately? Are the sets really a good idea/ worth it??? (For us ladies who do makeup almost everyday but don’t have that “artist” touch 😂 )
 Thanks. Love ya! 😘
Your talking so fast lol
UGHHHH the red wedding was literally the saddest 😭
The collection is gorgeous and seems to be very good quality, but I suspect is is more of a collectors collection that usable makeup for the average person.  I love Urban Decay, but I think a lot of their stuff is not for every day use for the average person.
I have never seen game of thrones but I watched this video because I love all of your videos ☺️
Mannnyyyy!!! We need a makeup collection video!! You're setup looks amazing and I would love to see how it is inside the drawers too!
THIS IS THE HONEST TRUTH!!!! Whenever I watch your videos I am so entertained and instantly get into a better mood. You make me laugh so much!!!! I will literally watch one of your videos if I'm having a blah day and it always makes me crack up with laughter!!! I mean I also learn a lot and love learning about what you teach but your videos are just incredibly entertaining! I buy all your products for friends and family!!! I can just tell that if we hung out together we would have non stop stomach cramps from laughing so hard! Now I know that will never happen but a girl can dream LOL keep the videos and amazing products coming!!!!
I was pregnant with my youngest when Red Wedding aired, freaked me out and still can't watch it to this day. 😂
Finally here to watch the review and I’d have to say Mrs. John Snow Targaryen is my fav 😂😂
Aye mirrrrrrrra que bonita ❤️ 

Never been into the hype of the show but then again I’ve never given it a shot. Maybe one day haha
0:57
I CAN'T GET OVER THIS! 😂
Fly wanted to be in Manny's vid too!
Defo do a Video on the ikea storage and beauty room tour 😍😍 need storage ideas to save my make up from my crotch demons 😂😂😂🙈
OH MY!! YOU ARE SO PRETTY! I LOVE IT 💕
(Screaming) 🗣 I just want the bushes lol love you Manny!
I honestly don’t watch Game of Thrones but I’ve heard everyone rave about it! The collection looks cute tho! ❤️🥰
👊Mean comment!👊 jkjk i Luh You!! ❤
the eye look makes your eyes pop & theyre so pretty😍
Love how the matte colors are looking! Love the vids Manny! Hi from Sault ste marie, MI.
My husband agreed to watch all the seasons before this new one so that we can watch it together. He said if he had started watching it on his own he wouldve quit after the first season. He said it was too much information, but went way too slowly. After the third season, he was totally hooked on his own. He said if he wasnt watching it for me he wouldve never finished because it took so long for him to become invested in it. Now hes impatiently waiting for the new season.
you are so funny omg i love youuuu❤️
For me it was the sons in the pie revenge for red wedding I died when I saw the thumb 😂 🤣🥵🤮
Love your new background!
I love the background change!
HOW ARE YOU SO CASPER?!
I would watch game of thrones but I can’t afford $15 a month for HBO
I’ve watched it through and through 3 times oh my goshhhhh I feel as if I’ve lived it!!!
Why is he the guy version of Antonio Garza its great!
I love the background.
my favorite part of my day
u so cuuute !!!✨💕🔥
More info about your makeup closet 💓😊
Omg!!! Buying that highlighter palette and those brushes my goodness
I have never seen GOT but my boyfriend LOVES it!
The highlighters are sooooooooooooo pretty! But I don’t think I can con myself into spending, $36?? I mean it’s $12 per highlight & I really wish they were sold separately.
This look low-key reminded me of Jessica Rabbit, but I loved it!
Love you and the video☺
U crack me up manny!! 🤣🤣🤣
When are we going to get an asmr makeup video 😂 I want one so bad.
In what world is UD not high end? They might not be luxury, but they're definitely high end.
🐲🐲🐲🐉🐉🐉

You’re the queeen 💚💚 love you!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GOD BLESS! Thank you for the lovely greeting with my sister last night event
I LOVE THE BACKGROUND!
Manny. You make my life. ❤️
Haven’t really watched it want to binge tho. My ex got me started on it then we broke up 🧝🏼‍♀️😏🤣
I've finished 5 seasons I need to watch the others
Why did you just get me so much more hyped for the new season of GOT?! Such a fun video!!!💋
I try to keep myself for saying that character is my favorite because I would always say Rob is my favorite all the time! But then the red wedding happened... so I can’t trust anyone anymore lol love GOT tho
My favourite Game Of Thrones character is Tyrion Lannister
“I bend the knee... i bend my elbows, and my toes” 😂😂😂😂😂
Is it really necessary to curse this much in a video about  makeup??
Lost it at “i am.. Sh...kira” 😂😩
Gorgeous as always😘🐝
I love got!will definitely get this collection !
I LOVE the makeup storage in the background!! It's so pretty <3
Boom I’m getting that Highlight pallet!!! Thanks manny
Game of Thrones is my favorite show and Urban Decay is one of my favorite make up brands!!! I'm so excited about the collection! Do you know what time the collection will be available on April 14th?
Manny is so pretty <3
Cute background however the fact that the camera kept going out of focus on it hurt my eyes! And it was distracting! And hard to not look at well you did your makeup!
I FUCKEN MISSED YOU!!! 🙏🏼🙌🏼❤️🥰
i’m so happy to be watching this review right now!! big time “GOT” FAN HERE 🙌🏼

I LOVE YOU MANNY!!! you’re so fricken funny!!! ❤️🤩
I watched a couple episodes just never got into it, it was boring to me 😬🤣 but I can watch you all day boo ❤️
Tbh I would never buy anything from this collection cause they are so overpriced all the highlighters are too dark for me lol, the eyeshadow only has 3 mattes and the packaging is a ridiculous size ans honestly I don’t even like the game of thrones aha sorry for the rant hahaha
Happy Birthday Manny!!💕☺🎉
Sharing the love for Manny and possibly cute makeup (in the process of watching) but Games of Thrones? Sounds like a chess game or something lol. Is it actually worth all the hype? I tried 10 times to watch the first episode of Breaking Bad,  which was also hyped up. Lmk if this is actually worth it? 

LOVE YOU MANNY 💛💝
Never watched game of thrones before ...😂sorry manny love ya!😘
I love GOT! I use to be those people who thought it was weird because it was very medieval but I fell in love! Such a great show!!
I needed this review! So thank you. However, I'm a die hard GOT fan! 
The North remembers!
I must be one of very few people who hasn't watched GoT. Don't hate me !
That eyeshadow really makes your eyes pop!
If you really loved GoT as you say you do, I think you would know how to pronounce the names of the dragons (highlighter shades)
Love this video! Happy Belated Birthday. Of course I want to see your makeup storage I want to live the fantasy of your life!
Living for this only because he pronounced all the names properly!!!!!! Yes girl
Might actually watch GOT now 😂
Oh Jesus!!! Cover that up!!!😂😂😂😂

Love you so stinkin much Manny!!!!♥️
I am so sad i didnt get to meet u at beautycon yesterday. I literally had a sec video of you saying hi. But i wanna be greedy and be able to hug u 😩
you with the fly killed me 😂
Love the purple shadow. I've never watched Game of Thrones but I don't know anything about it or have anything against it.
I am so excited about this collab, since Im a big fan of the show. I thought the Winterfell/Stark section was a miss because I don't think it represents the house as well as the rest do. I would have loved to see more grey... since Stark colors are grey and white. And Robb had it coming, Thalia was just a distraction and his ultimate downfall!
Mannys intros are EVERYTHING! Love him 💙
Manny losing his marbles the first minute for the video lol 😂 love you
You and I would be the Bestest of Friends. Just putting it out there :D Happy Birthday Manny <3
I wanna see how you build it 🙋🏻‍♀️
The red wedding broke me 😭 but when Arya came back for them that was everything
Am I the only one who didn’t like Robb and Catelyn? I was kind of LIVING the Red Wedding. 

Just got my eyeshadow palette. It is SICKENING 🔥
I'm not a big fan og THAT many mc's in shows. Literally everybody dies. And in the first and only 3 episodes I tried watching there was incest at least like 3 times. I was also very confused, I feel like there wasn't enough context. Granted that was only like 3 episodes.
You literally need to do a makeup collection video!!!!!
I love Game of Thrones but my husband hates it his reason to many of his favorite characters died to early
Kudos for even filming after that long ass flights!! You are a lil delusional but it’s funny and I love it and I love your cupboard behind!!! Im not a GOT fan but I really appreciate your effort in filming! ❤️❤️ regarding ur ques, never been interested in watching GOT, never tried to watch it, I personally don’t watch a lot of tv so I’m very selective and prefer to watch comedies then anything. Life is too serious so I escape with laughing 😁 btw loved the hold the door ref. That’s the only thing I know and the red wedding cause my bf watches the show hahahaha
Unpopular opinion .... I don't care at all about GOT but I'm here Bish! Haha. Great video as always... You Know Tha Deal With That! Much Love MannyMob😉✌💚
This purple makes your eyes pop so beautifully! Gorgaaa!
omg the Red wedding made me cry my eyes out and I was so mad after I got myself together. I want the palette and Sansa and White walker lipsticks!
Came up in my recommended.. People take a shot every time he says sickening. Jesus
OMG, THIS IS SUCH A GORGEOUS LOOK...WHEN HE FINISHED THE OTHER EYE, I WAS LIKE THIS IS FIRE
You are a mood. And I need you to vlog and to do a drive with me.
I tried a couple times watching it when it first came out first season, I couldn’t keep up with their accents honestly lol! I was confused they were using words I didn’t understand... is there something wrong with me? I had to think too much and it annoyed me! Anyone else???
Would love more detail about the shelving you built...home videos and PR are my favorite!
Yes manny!!! We wanna know about the IKEA storage thing
I had to go to therapy after The Red Wedding

I love you so much ughh I want to meet you so bad 💕😔
WE NEED A MAKEUP COLLECTION VIDEO
The reddish purple ah eye reminds me of the dragon from Shrek! I live!!!
I honestly just LOVE watching your videos.. would you like to come down to southern Florida and have lunch?!?! .. I feel like we can be great friends HAHAHAH
I have developed almost a phobia to seeing naked people because I'm recovering from being raped. The Game of Thrones has way too many naked people and sexual scenes in it for me to watch. I'm sure it's a good show though.
I don't watch GOT, but watching your excitement makes me so happy 😊😊 I tried watching but it's too gory for me. I like the idea of it, I'm just too sensitive 😳😳😂
Yes queen! We need to see an in depth makeup storage tour!!!
I just love you!!!!!
love this entire theme!! What is the price point for the entire collection? I want it all!!!
🐲🐲🐲 I wanted to rewatch 1-7 before the 8th season but I cannot put myself thru that trauma of the Red Wedding again. I literally cried like I was dying
I couldn't get past the 2nd episode because they killed the dire wolf
I literally STOPPED watching GoT after I saw the Red Wedding. I cried so hard and couldn’t deal, so I made an executive decision to not watch for a few years 😂😂
I personally love GOT, however, I think the people that dont like it usually say that the story line is too involved and theres too many characters to keep track of.  I think it's an attention span thing.  I think if they kept watching, they would get into it and be addicted though.
Never watched an episode. Not a style of show i like to watch.
Manny you are my favourite beauty guru by far, always make me laugh "I'm Shakira,  I'm sha-quiche" 😂😂 just wanted to tell you keep doing what you are doing, love you the most 😘
The snap of you and Brad made my day I wanna see a collab 😫
It legit cant be late at night when i watch a Manny Mua video because within ten seconds im screaming and waking my whole house up 😂😂😂. Youre so naturally funny nothing is forced and i love that. Not that I dont love watching you review makeup etc. But i watch your videos to watch you and to laugh. Thank you for being you!
My mom and her bf r OBSESSED with GOT
“I wanna slap my face just to feel something “ 😂😂😂
So excited for another video oh btw today is my birthday 😊
Your personality is always so entertaining 🙃

MANNY'S NOTIF SQUAD WHERE YOU AT!?




- also a youtuber trying to hit 10k!
I couldn’t even use one of those highlighters
To all those who couldnt get into GOT....it took me til almost the 3rd season for me to get into it cuz I couldnt keep up with so many characters or who was with whose army.....but girl!!!! I am obsessed now! The relationships between lovers and friendships like arya and the hound! And Sam and john snow....god I fucking love it!!!!
I ❤️ you so much!
U r so cute 🥰
Happy Birthday Manny!!!!!! It’s my birthday today too. I’m loving the new house. I hope for all good things to come your way. Love ya hunny.
“I’ve never seen a thicker pallet before in my life”

Bisssh, you done did see blood sugar, and blue blood.
It is pricey but like you said it's a collection for game of thrones. Live the eye look.
lol I just love your channel! you're so funny!
Maaaannnyyyy!! I love you (:
Yessssssss. And hold door 😂❤️❤️
Can you make a video showing your make up room, how everything is sorted and organized.
You are one of my favorite people ever!
I live for your videos ❤️
I liked Game of Thrones but stopped watching it cause HBO is too expensive
The moment with the fly omg haha
I originally didn't like GoT after only watching the 1st episode because I was so upset at what Cersei and Jaime did to Bran :(
I LOVE GAME OF THRONES
I love you manny your so funny and act just like me. You make me laugh every time I watch you! Hope you have a great birthday!!
I like the palette I might get it or get one of the lipsticks.  But I think I can achieve your look with the prism palette which I need to give some use to🙊
Love you manny 💓💓
When Manny takes his storage tips from my queen Jamie Genevieve 💜
That fly moment was so funny 😂😂😂😂😂
Make up storage for sureXO❤️
Ahhh Sylvia did this too😍
GOT fan all the way!!  My favs are Danarys and Jon Snow of course but my Bish is Arya....I named my Sheba Husky Arya!!
HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY QUEEN 👑 ITS YOUR DAY OWN IT LIKE YOU ALWAYSSSS DO DAILY! 🎊🎉🎈💗
Manny is KILLING youtube lately. Funny and talented!! We stan
I love your vids, it makes me laugh so much. And your spanglish is so funny too.
Love when u talk fast 😘
when you watch this and a Dolce & Gabbana add starring Emilia Clarke pops up
you killllls me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can't wait to pick up this eyeshadow palette 😍
Bronn is actually my favorite character
Spaz sleep deprived manny is my new fav!!! My parents loved GOT and I saw a few episodes but when they did hodor dirty I couldn’t watch it. I was so sad. Love the look so much!!
Awww baby...you deserve all the best because you are able to rise above the petty bs 🎂 🎂 love
@kaelliott on insta
I kinda like the background!!
this is definitely one of the funniest and best videos Manny made lol
The Red Wedding haunted me for weeks!!!!! I bing watched all the seasons before the new comes and guess what???? I fast forwarded The Red Wedding!!!!!! 😳
Manny, I love your reviews and content. I very much look forward to your future content and endeavors. Makeup is new to me and with every passing week, I try to practice more on my roommate as my Guinea pig.
Okay I love ur makeup wall! So gorgeous
You made me laugh the entire video with all the GOT jokes😂 I'm a super fan too Haha
You look stunning 💖
Omg I relate to you talking about why people DONT like GOT on a spiritual level 😂
Happy birthday gorgeous 😘
i totally want to hear/see more about the makeup storage setup behind you. also, i don't know what it is about your brows today but WOAH 🔥
Just started Game of Thrones a month ago! I still have season 7 to go. Daenerys is also my favorite!!
I live near where Winterfell was filmed
I don’t like u but you did a great job reviewing it
Indonesia?wutttt ;_____;
Omg I've watched and rewatched GOT at least 5 times. I am so obsessed with the show and more excited for April 14th..... Love your videos and the UD GOT makeup. I am a sucker for John Snow and Khal Drogo, OMG they are sooo hot.
Happy late birthday Manny. 💋
Love you!!!
I haven't watched Game of Thrones cuz 
(this is gonna sound lame)....it's not the kind of sense of humor, I like. I've just been watching a lot of shows with dark humor. Don't hate me.
Happy birthday 🎂🎊🎂🎉🎁🎈☺️
Nikita Dragun must be screaming
“Middle end” 😂😂🤔🤣
Honestly if they were just gonna do 3 mattes they should have split it up into 4 smaller eyeshadow palettes by house... it might have made more sense that way. People could just add the shimmers/house they wanted to their collection.

Also the red wedding definitely fucked me up but how bad was it watching princess shireen burned at the stake by her own fucking parents
“I bent my elbow & my toes” 😭😭
I bend my elbows and my toes. Lmao
Unless you love GOT, there not worth it.
Did anyone else pause it when the camera focused on his background just to get a glimpse of his collection? No, just me. Okay carry on lmaoooo
I love this look, and I know it would have been a lot but I would have loved if you swatched all the eyeshadows on your eye instead of just your hand and arm. I've seen other you tubers do it but I value your opinion on things like that!
Don’t think I’ve ever seen you comb your fingers through your hair so much like you are really feeling yourself today sis 😂
Beautiful!!🔥💙
I love you manny! I was feeling fuckn down, and my conscious told me biiiitch go see manny! And now am here feeling like the F a b u l o u s  B I t c h I  A M 🖤🖤💜🖤💜
I LOVE WATCHING UR VIDEOS
I’ve been looking forward to this while I was at work
Flashback Mary entered the chat
I've tried to watch GOT, mostly because Jason Momoa is in it...but, I just couldn't get past the first episode. It didnt really keep my attention.
Honestly I just jumped on the GOT hype train during this last season coming out because of my mom, I thought it might have just been over rated and was worried it wouldn’t live up to the hype, I’m more of a book person so I reallyyyyy wanted to get around to reading them first but also didn’t want to ruin the show by doing so. So my mom finally got me to watch it and I’m OBSESSED! My husband on the other hand... he couldn’t even make it through season 1 for him personally it was just too slow, because of work he didn’t really have to time to commit to it like I did and to be able to really pay attention and come back wayyyy later and still remember what had been going on or who was/wasn’t dead. 😅😂
Love the shadows 💙
I laughed so hard in the first 2 minutes of this...
I’ve never watch the game of thrones but I’ve so many good things about it. I LOVE YOU MANNY!
I love that you’re actually a GOT fan! I watched another review and the person couldn’t pronounce the names at all.
I died during the “red wedding” (“The Rains of Castamere”!) poor Rob!
Too expensive just for the theme...
Ddaenerys is awesome and I love her too!! I love GOT and actually at first I thought I wouldnt like it but the first season I was hooked!! I have seasons 1 through 5 box sets and I can't wait for this bew season!!!
HI MANNY IT,S TINA HAVING FUN HAPPY BIRTHDAY
I tried watching GoT and I got to the beginning of season 3 but it’s too hard to watch. To many people and too many names ! Lolol
Mainly Evil. I was dying. 💗
Beautiful darlin!
I love that blue/white liner 😍😍
I’m struggling because I LOVE GOT but I’m not a fan of any part of this collection.
🐉🐲 loved this video. I'm a huge GOT fan.
I love you manny 😂😂
You really captured he GOT vibe with those eye colors. This collection is perfect for premiere night!
Omg I have the same Pax closet system in my makeup room for storage!!!! I fucking love the glass front drawers they look so good but it’s nice to have the white drawer fronts too so that you don’t have to make sure everything is perfect in the drawer
I started watching GOT when it first started and was loving it!!! I got midway through the first season and that's the last I watched. Too much going on in my life to sit and watch but I will be starting over and will binge watch to catch up
Lort, I wish that I had that!
I think the pallet looks gorgeous.
I like the background better than a colored backdrop!
9:55 for the metal base i think thats a pretty reasonable price they are really cool and nice looking brushes
I've never seen one single episode. Lol
I like the background
Love the packaging 😍😍😍
Your new highlighter looks nicer
Omg..when you slapped that fly I screamed 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i went and got the eyeshadow palette today Love Love Love it 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’m a huge GOT fan and Manny Mua fan so both together is amazing!!!
My birthday is the  April 6th🔥🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕🔥💕
I LOVE YOU XOXOXO HUGS AND KISSES 😘
most entertaining beauty YouTuber that actually knows what they're talking about. love you so much many
Ok call me weird but I’m living for his storage as the background
Your shirt is perfect! You’d fit in at a Renaissance Faire!! My whole family dressed up last year when we went to a Faire.. my husband’s shirt was red and my son’s was white! 🤴🏻👸🏼🧝🏻‍♂️🧝‍♀️
I don't know if I want the collection but... GOT!! Can't wait. Happy Birthday!
I dont watch it for the gore.

I'm pretty sensitive to graphic bloody scenes. I can only handle little bits of it at the time. I think I managed to get to season 6, because my ex would beg me to watch just 1-2 at a time.

Otherwise, the story was amazing. I just couldn't handle the violence.
Me: watching game of thrones 
My hubby: Babe I need your help for a few minutes! 
Me: ok! 4 hours later still watching GOT 
My hubby: Babe come here!! 
Me: ok give me a few more minutes!!! *watches one whole season so into this 
My hubby: Nevermind!!! 
Me ok... *still so into it and now in another season!!! Lol but true
I want to see what the beauty room look like lol
Love this <333
I'm reading the books then imma watch the show!
I love the back ground honey 🍯
I laughed when he said Urban Decay isn't high end... its at Sephora, its in the high-end side of Ulta. It isn't luxury like hourglass or tom ford or anything, but Urban Decay is on the same price level as Too Faced, Benefit, Tarte, etc, which is all high-end.
I did pretty much this same look a week or so ago with a purple from Space Case Cosmetics!! I loved it so much.
I love this collection! I definitely agree you're paying for the GoT name. I am LIVING for the eye look. Too bad there weren't more mattes, otherwise I would have SNATCHED that palette. I cried when you played Rains Over Castamere when the fly came LMAO
I liked it but they was too many scenes that made me feel really uncomfortable  so I stop watching it x
Honestly I really like the camera set up with your beauty storage behind you ❤️❤️
Sending good vibes to all.
NEED a tour of this room !!! And you look bomb as always Manny 💯. I’m not a GOT fan (never watched it), but seeing any one slay with makeup is always fun lol.
I have been a GOT fan since Season One, Episode One. Also, I have read all of the big ass books, cover to cover. I knew this show would have to come to an end, but it’s too soon. I really hope the come back with another version covering the earlier years. The stories that built the characters and who they are must be told...either by book or by Dave and Dan. 
I want the full PR set when it’s released, use it, and save it like I did the Alice in Wonderland Collection. 
Thanks for your review Manny, and for using so many colors. Love you! 🥰
Why’d you have to bring Hodor into this?! 😭😭😭😭 still too soon 😂😭😂
I've never watched it, i don't even know what it's about oops
Happy late birthday! Mine was April 6th!
I didn’t watch game of thrones for two years after the red wedding because I was so upset
manny <3<3<33<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
Yes queen. Please tell me how you customized it.
My mom hates game of thrones bc she doesn’t like how the woman are treated. She’s had some rough experiences and doesn’t like to watch things that remind her of the experiences she’s had. I love the show personallly, but I understand why some people can’t handle it/don’t like it. :)
I personally haven’t watched it yet but my husband doesn’t think I’ll be able to because I’m always on my phone when we’re watching shows 🙈 he said it’s one of those shows you NEED to pay attention too and I lowkey have ADHD when we’re watching something on Netflix or whatever lol. I want to try and watch it though!
I wish it was all of the houses instead of using white walkers. Mainly because I miss House Tyrell.
manny literally slays i love him sm💗💞💓💞💗💘💓
I think it's gorgeous
I like game of thrones only on season 2 but some scenes are hard to watch 😞
GAME OF THRONES IS LIIIIFE
I. Need. That. Lip Stain!!!
For me personally I'm not a fan bc i just can not look past the fact that there are mythical creatures and stuff. I just like more realistic topics.
Love you Manny!! XOXO
yes ,  i realy want to know how you build it , can you also make a tour and if you have a video of how you organised it .
I’m sorry but I’m soooo glad those purple curtains and 1970s lamp is goneeeee
Manny tries to hard
Love Game of Thrones so much! My 3 year old son is named Tyrion.
I so want this hole collection but can’t afford 240 dollar omg I want it it my favorite show
I'm so buying the collection!
I didn't start watching GOT until it was a few seasons in but I kept hearing so much about it and a friend told me I would really like it so I gave it a try. HOOKED.... I watched every season I could find back to back. LOVE!!!
Happy Birthday!!!
OKAY HELLO NEW BACKGROUND!
I've never watched game of thrones.... but I can't imagine it being more entertaining than this video!! lol!
Iv never seen a episode of game of thrones. But I also dont really watch TV  shows in general.
you're my favorite
Olenna Tyrell was my favorite! Bad ass granny
Kinda like the background
Love you so much ❤️❤️❤️
He is so shady😂😏😞
I would love to see a in depth video about your makeup storage!
Love it when you speak Spanish....so cute love watching your videos...
When Manny on a crazy day is me on a good day
I don’t like game of thrones because of the first season where the king was killed. I cried and I can’t go through what the same thing that greys anatomy put me through😂
These seem to be great formulas and colors.  Thanks for making it so much fun 🤗👏. I’d love an in depth look at the new makeup units 💗
I saw there doing "Avengers" makeup pallettes please try
HUGE GOT fan!  Thanks for doing this video!! Talking the GOT game!
Aria :stick em with the pointy end
The north remembers winter is coming that red wedding was juss so messed up
“I’m Sha-quiche” 😂😂😂
Love and live for the eyes!!!
I thought the Red Wedding wrecked me until "Hold the Door." I randomly cry now when I hear people just being courteous holding a door
Urban decay really just be throwin colors together in a palette
In what world is urban decay not high end??
I really really love this collection so much! Hardcore GOT stan!! Yes.... the Red Wedding.... my god... 👰 🎩
OMG WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY 🤩🤩
Yes manny!!!!! 🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲
I am a fan of game of thrones love that tv show
Omfg g.o.t is my life I didn't really like it at first but my boyfriend was watching it so I got stuck watching it and fell in love
Lmao you are so funny! Love you 💕
pauses GoT to watch this
U are soo goofy i love it!! Shakira...lolzzz
Jon snow needs to eat me! Im dying 😂
I love u manny ❣❣❣❣❤️❤️❤️
Can't wait to get this pallette
Aside from the obvious favorites, I love Arya. She's such a bad ass!
Soooo funny .happy birthday;)
Is it sad that I was broken for years after the Red Wedding? Gutted me 😭
I’ve never watched game of thrones
Tyrion hands down is the absolute best! I love how clever he is. Then it’s a ty between Danny and John Snow. The Red Wedding had me fucked up for a while. But in the book it didn’t even phase me because it is just a scene you gotta see instead of hear.
Not a fan of game of thrones but that blonde dragon girl is hot af!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MANNY!!!!🎂🎂🎂🎂🥂
such a cutieeee❤️
Def The Red Wedding was devastating
Ive never watched this show 1) i dnt have hbo subscription 2) not interested in mideval situation
You need to get with Laura!
I don’t like game of thrones because i’m not into that type of tv show
Edits are great lol
Ahh I have training with this collection this month and I’m so excited!
GOT is my favorite show. I’m really happy that it’s finally back, but I’m so bummed that there’s only six more episodes.😢
I was waiting for a Red Wedding lipstick
It’s not that I don’t like it.. it’s that I’m too ADD and there are so many story lines I get bored 🤷🏻‍♀️
Red Wedding: same 😫🙄
Happy Birthday manny ❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉🎂🎁🎈🎊
I tried watching the first season but I had a hard time getting over the rapey scenes. I know that was kinda true to the time and I know it gets better after the first season but I just never revisited it. I definitely need to though because I've heard such amazing things about it.
The fly 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love you Manny ❤
I tried watching it forever ago and i didnt like how much nudity and sex and all of that there was. That was a long time ago. Then i tried watching it again recently and understanding why it was like that and the story and now i am obsessed and i love love love the show. Its so interesting and cool to see. And I live for Khalessi (i have a dog named after her per my man who is obsessed with the show) and teryan and Aria. They are some badasses! And i for sure will be buying the whole kit and everything im so excited
What did you swat at😂😂
Game of thrones 😍
Um Urban Decay, do a Walking Dead line. Some of us want to look like death.
I wanna see how you built your closet 😭 also how you mapped it out ??
Great look and fab review
I never got into game of thrones Bc I really was interested in watching it then forgot when it came on then next thing I knew the first season was halfway done and I didn’t feel like playing catch up....so now I’m just gonna wait until it’s done and do it all the way 😂😂😂😂😂
Happy birthday manny!
I totally love your personality! You are super captivating, good looking, funny and adorable! I feel your truly passionate vibes on this make up! I'm wayyyy more excited about this make up line than I already was... which is more than i thought possible already. I'm sure you've been told before your enthusiasm is contagious. You really gracefully layer all kinds of cool stuff here... authenticity... real insight... practical use stuff and more then ... hahaha my boyfriend loved it too right now. You are so funny n quirky!!!
And to over do it with the compliments... Haha "buttery crispy flake!...concise and objective  breakdown all the essentials... ahahah "it's actually fucking cute". "Pinche swords"! This is my first video from you I've seen! Cant wait to see more and to buy the whole line now. Maybe not the pinche expensive swords. The only thing constructive I could say and I'm reaching... is you forgot to name the brush sword chingases. Though you totally sold me at med-evil. <3 <3 <3 <- FUN FACT: My older  brother thought those hearts were "boobies x3" not hearts. white Walker d!! Gorgeous end-look!  Official go to youtube make up person. Rock on.
Yes, do a detail tour of your storage makeup.
I’ve never seen an episode of GOT because I used to work 50 hours a week and I would do errands and chores on my days off. I am too late in the game to get it started.
Am I the only one who hasn’t seen Game of Thrones???🙃😬😱
Love game of thrones
leave the beauty room as your back drop and yes please go in depth of your beauty room/tour of your collection
you should take a break from beauty con this year... just saying
Do a makeup vid only speaking Spanish
i tried to watch GOT but then they killed a dog a few episodes in and i just couldnt watch it again. too sad. i love animals too much...... so i dont watch it . im sensitive lol
I love you boo 😘
I've tried watching GOT but I couldn't get passed all the nudity I felt like I was watching a porn show
Ok you are so funny and so unique I’m loving you! Subscribed
Loving the look, Manny! And to answer your question about the why people don't like it, it took me a while to really get into it because these are long episodes, and at first there isn't much happening so you really need to have your mind set to watch something of that sort. I finally got through the most "boring" episodes and actually love the show but that was a real issue at first for me. And I know a lot of my friends don't watch it because they ended up falling asleep from being bored on episode one.
People like games of thrones because its explicit. Other than that, I dont see the hype. And yes, I watch more than 1 episode to come  this conclusion
Love Manny’s loca energy
Just started watching, finished first season. Started 2nd season. The only reason why I wanted to watch Game of Thrones was because I found out there were dragons in the episodes........ I mean why not it's dragons why wouldn't you watch you. Im in love with game if thrones can't wait to watch them all. I bought all 7 seasons 😍😍😎😎😎😉😊
Lol... the jetlag is real!
How can you LOOOOOOVE got if you dont know how to pronounce Rhaegal...
I think the collection would be incredible for GOT fans. However, I never caught on to the fad of it because of the incest scenes. The curve balls are pretty nice, but no. I just think it drags for too long. Btw, happy belated birthday :D
You are so hilarious 😂😂😂
Manny is my gay daddy.
I've never watched game of thrones but I'm just watching for manny lol dont come at me
I just don’t have access to the show otherwise I’d watch it and check it out for myself! It sounds good! And are we going to see the Blue Blood collection reviewed sometime soon pweeeees! Love you!
I’m here after watching the vlog with lushious !!! now I love you too !!!!
Yass! Love it
I love the new storage
Never seen any episode of game of thrones lmao just not my speed.. but I'm here for your channel no matter what lol
Ugh I love Jamie
“Don’t leave a mean comment” 😂
Happy birthday manny
Lol... "F*cking your sister" haha "too far"... Bahaha! that's seriously the reason why I couldn't get into the show!
Ok legit I have never wanted to watch GOT, even though plenty of people I know have urged me to, as much as I do right now just so I can know what you’re talking about. Lol Manny might make me a believer of the GOT magic. 😂😂
I love your videos super much they make me happy love u manny xx 💋
and then fuxx ur sista, that's too far.... lmfao but it's GOT!!!!! ANYTHING is possible, if it hasn't happened before
My favorite part of your videos are the bloopers!
THE PACKAGING OMG OMG OMG
I don't understand anyone who doesn't like got. I mean, its as addictive as crack. Jon snow and my queen of dragons better slayyyy and steal that throne!
I kept trying to turn up the volume on my phone butttt it’s still quiet 😪
I wish that we would have had a breakdown of the eyeshadows. I know there were swatches, but no clue what was what. I appreciate everything else.. Just wish I knew what was what before buying the collection.
Show me your makeup set up
make a tour/ makeup collection video!
I neeeeeeed it🤯
Where is your shirt from? It looks really nice. :)
Shiiit Iam late lol
FOR THE THRONE OF COURSE!👸🏼 I wish I could afford the whole collection but I'm probably going to get the palette, blue liner and the Sansa lipstick. I would love to meet you and just hang out sometime, you ate an amazing person. Love you Manny 💖💖💖🕶🛍💄🐈🐕🐎💖💖💖forgot to tell you my favorite character in GOT, Daenerys Targaryen and John Snow! I'm so forgetful.... HAPPY BIRTHDAY SWEETIE🍦🎂🎁
Like for the fly😅
The first time I tried to watch game of thrones I hated it because I couldn't sit through the violence. But now I'm older and let my boyfriend tell me when it's ok look hahaha. Team targaryen all the way!
Delusional Manny is 👑 💋❤️
The closest I’ve ever come to watching game of thrones 🐲
I love you!!
I really want to watch it but I don't have TV at my apartment, only Netflix. But I'm hoping to get the DVD sets for my birthday next month!
I can’t watch anything with suspense in it. I get violently ill! I wish I could watch it but I just cannot!
I love your new house
Sansas such an underrated bad ass... but that red wedding messed me up 😬😬😬
Daenerys and Aria are my favorite females. Jon snow my favorite Male . Lol predictable I know.
“Are you a fan of Game if Thrones?”

My daughter is named Daenerys lol
from the moment you started speaking about mean comments right up to slapping yourself to feel something is the way every brain cell in my head is at all times i'm dying i love you so much
I love the colors but have never even seen game of thrones lmao
Review blue blood palette
I love Dany!! Good review.
It would probably be helpful if you displayed the pallets as you name the colors you're using.
Love you so much
Ok but I appreciate your little allusive banter cause literally just started watching and I would’ve smashed my phone if you ruined the red wedding for me xx
The red wedding bruh. That was cruel. But I’m the book the mother is supposed to come back as a badass revenge seeking creature. But the tv show was like nah.
I am obsessed with Game of Thrones! I’ve never been more obsessed with a show in my life!
MANNY I LOVE YOU!!!
I love this eye look 😍
It's pretty but I totally agree...what the f am I going to do with 3 mattes??? And it's all a little to pricey for me personally
This palette is kind of giving me “born to run” vibes ima say a hard pass
Arya coming back and feeding Walder Frey his sons. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I've never actually seen game of thrones. I know so many people are obsessed with it and I've just never had the urge to even watch 1 episode. Don't really have a reason why haha. I have been thinking about checking it out recently though but still just not super interested.
Tried watching GOT and I just really don’t get into that kind of shows. I don’t like fantasy shows or anything like Harry Potter. I’m more into something that is more realistic 🤭
Happy early birthday girl!!!!
Who else got a Game of Thrones ad before the video???
I love you omg
I stopped watching the episode before the red wedding. Literally had a nightmare about it. Everyone I loved died and I couldn’t handle it anymore.
I want to watch it but I don't have HBO...
Love Game of Thrones !!!!!!
Love those shelves behind you!!
😍😍💜
Happy bday babe❣️❣️
Love ya sleep
How much is the whole collection?
Fan 😍👑
It's cool because it's GOT but I only want the brushes NOT the 250 dollar set. :-(
oh manny please, drop the "  literally " why ? because people who read books, don't use that word. constructive observation. is just like Jlo every time she drops "you know "
Can you please video yourself watching an episode of GOT so we can get your live reaction? I would die hahaha
I almost got thru the 1st season but had to stop because the gory violence and boobs were too much. Give me plot! Not shock!
Snow and daneryes my favorite characters
I drink and I know things
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MANNY
The red wedding was ...... so painful.
Never seen GoT
I cried and screamed so loud while watching the Red Wedding, my mom ran into my room and asked me if I was okay. And I replied back “NO! 😭😭😭” I almost quit watching GoT after that episode lol.
A like and a comment
Never seen it 😳
Never watched Got....
Uno de mis videos favorito.
Mi personaje Deannerys
🐉🐲love the new place!🐉🐲
Yes the red wedding is the WORSTTTTT.
Stopped watching got at season 5. Literally killed almost everyone i loved off the show and left only like two or three i liked. I’d like to get back into it i just sort of got bored 😞. Love this idea though! I feel like with 20 shadows they had an option to do 10 Matt 10 shimmer/glitter. So few Matt’s seems scary 😖
Yes, DIED after the red wedding
When I saw the red wedding scene, it 🤬 me up! No wonder why you were pissed about that moment. I’m sorry that I don’t watch GOT, because I don’t have HBO, but Bravo to the writers for writing that scene brilliantly well, & of course, amazing performances by the cast. I won’t watch it because it’s too graphic for me, & it’s too depressing to see good people die first, & the bad guys get away with murder.
we love an icon
I love Game of Thrones, but can’t watch it because I don’t have cable.  Infinity is too expensive!
Oh my GOT
Who thought “OMG that’s Jamie Genevieve’s make up room” even before Manny mentioned it? 🙋🏽‍♀️
I love you manny
I've never watched Game of Thrones. I love fantasy and SciFi, but I could never get interested enough to watch it. Maybe the whole incest thing is why it doesn't appeal to me.
lolol that fly swat
Biggest fan of GOT ever I love it obsessed can’t wait for the new season!
3:30 in dee morning & we watching manny like it was religion lol but damn I shouldn’t have because I want it soooo fkn bad!! i feel urban decays pallets are all the same & now they got something totally different & fkn god i’m living for this... 🧝🏻‍♀️🐲🐲
While you’re in NYC, I’m pretty sure the throne is at Rockefeller center
I’ve never seen GOT but I’m literally DYING to watch it but just don’t know where
I am still mourning Drogo’s death
I would love to be able to get into it, but, I’m not a fan of shows/movies set in those eras.
Oh Manny! I forgot to mention, when I found out why you said that you hated the red wedding scene, it damn well ruined my Easter today. I know that this is off the subject a bit, but I almost had my Easter ruined 7 years ago when I was trying to finish reading the final Hunger Games  book on Easter Sunday that year. Thank God that I finished the book the next day after Easter, because when I found out what happened in the end of the story, I was cried for uncontrollably after I read the book.
at first i didn’t like game of thrones but i forced myself to continue and it’s my all time favorite now
You are the actual cutest
Waau beautiful mekup  box👌🙏😊
Love youuuuu Manny!
✌🤣
🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉 YEEESSSS!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!
My fav character by far is Arya she’s such a little badass
So first of all, I want to see a declutter video, those are fun. Second, the red wedding had me crying for days. Like, I get that you sometimes have to kill off characters, but come on! That’s just too much. I love game of thrones and can’t wait for it to start!!!!
Yes I died along with both starks at the red wedding!!! I had to take a break from watching for a few days to get myself back!!🤣🤣 but I love GOT great show!! I also think people dont want it because of the languages, sex, ( more so Cersei and jamie) and people cant seem to keep up with all the different houses and who kills who. Lol that's just my opinion
😍🐲🐲🐲🐲
The look is pretty but nothing new. I am not a Game of Thrones fan so it would be a go no for me
Red wedding = Arya redemption
My favorite is John snow his so sexy
Please show us your makeup storage setup pllllzzzz
LOL the frat snap
I tried watching the first episode and couldn’t get into it... never tried again but thinking of trying it again since everyone loves it
23:03 😂😂😂
as a survivor i’m afraid to watch it because my boyfriend said there’s a lot of rape and violence in it. i’m scared that it’ll trigger me and make me have nightmares. but this eyeshadow palette is ABSOLUTELY stunning
Beautiful !!
Thanks for the video.. The eye look .. I like it..
I’m in love 💙
Tan Bella love u baby
so i’ve tried to watch it but i feel like you have to concentrate SO MUCH when watching it and my attention span isn’t that long 😩😩i srsly want to get into it tho
Very evil 😂😂😂😂 im dying
I love your videos!!! Would looovvvveeee to meet you but I live in the UK 🇬🇧
Some colors look like those from the distortion palette
I can’t wait for this!!
♥️ you manny
I want to watch Game of Thrones so badly! But I'm 14 so my brother wont allow me to watch it as he claims its 18+
I personally don’t watch GOT because I do t have a way to steam the show. So I think that’s the main reason. However I have heard that the show is a little gory and I personally am not into that. So that’s another reason I haven’t watched it. But a lot of my friends and coworkers are huge fans, so it does make me curious to watch the show...idk but I loved the love you created with the collection. I probably won’t be purchasing these items, but I really think it’s cool for all the fans.
Manny is so funny
I luv u! MUA💋
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday xx
Omg manny  está bien hermoso!!!
Happy birthday 🎈
❤️❤️😘
Yeah another miss on the pallette is it needs more mattes.
lol.. the fly look
Si estoy viendo esto es que ya me he visto todo el contenido de youtube. Quiero mi pin por semejante ejemplo de valentía.
Do a video with Jerry store
I just saw a GOT trailer while I was watching this vid! That was the first time I had seen the trailer and now I’m even more psyched for this Sunday’s ep!
I’m personally not a fan of Game Of Thrones but I absolutely love Urban Decay shadows and eyeliners. Because of that reason I would probably get the Eyeshadow Palette and the eyeliners. They are such great quality all across the board
the blooper of you clapping at 30:50 😂😭
Just text me when he's quitting
What foundation are you wearing???
I love GOT..very good acting..scenery...very good characters...love it
😂😂😂😂😂😂 you’re so funny!!!!
I’m really debating getting the lip and cheek stain bc i have lighter lips and when I work I don’t like wearing foundation and it would work as a good blush I think!
Yeah I had to take a break after the red wedding, I just couldn’t deal.
Damn he's still here hahaha
Wonderful review
15:12 the lannisters send their regards
Aries ♈️ baby’s we’re the best 4/11 you’re the best Manny
💙💙💙💙💙💙
I like everything about GoT but I’m very squeamish so it’s the excessive blood and gore that bothers me
I gave my like after the "sister"  sentence hahahahaha - also Im moving in the summer and I neeeeeeeeeeeed to know how you build this PAX-System for Makeup please please please !!!!!! I already own some PAX'  closets and I want one foe Makeup SO BAD, now that Ive seen your background <3 <3
Te amo hermoso, feliz cumpleaños pendeja!
Happy birthday
💖💖💖💖💖
I would love to win a set of this makeup
💖💖💖💖💖
Jon snow and Arya starkkkkk
I don’t not like game of thrones. I’ve never really watched it to not like it. I “watched” the first season but fell asleep and missed three episodes and just never got into it. 

stops video to google “the red wedding” 😩
I tried watching the first few episodes of game of thrones. I thought the plot was kind of interesting, but I'm kind of a baby when it comes to violence or sex. I felt like I spent a good portion of the show looking away from the screen
Love u puta ❤️❤️
Cute look.  I love it!!!  💗
I love you!!!!
❤❤❤❤
dead fly lol love you
Happy birthday
Werk 😉💕
Our girl is handy with tools ~~
That purple!!! I have to have it!
Love 💕 u 👑
Good job Manny!
Take the shirt off ..  keep the shirt off in all your videos
Feel like I’m stupid behind in games of thrones like to many seasons and episodes to even catch up 😢 regret not watching it on time 😩💔
delusional manny is a funny manny
❤️ Love GOT!
Nikita Dragun he is Gay right?
Nikita Dragun he is Gay right?
In Manny’s GoT version , “Reggaeton” is going to dance the Night King to death . PS I want to see Manny and his brother have a sword makeup brush duel in order to sit on the Iron Throne.
Love you!!!!! 🐲🐲🐲
❤️you!
yes, red wedding was epic but then when aria got walder frey back??? eating his kids baked into the pies???? ugh!!!
I like the bg tbh
🐲😍
Do you get to pick your ads & when they're placed in your videos? I've always been curious. I got a game of thrones ad in this video!  Is that a coincidence or no?
Manny me encanta la madre de dragónes por que es muy chingona y mérese ser la reina
I want it soooo bad I’m crying so hard right now 😭😭😭😭 also happy birthday 🎈🎂🎉!!! 🐲🐲🐲. Also I LOVE Game of Thrones I have been watching since the first season. And yea I don’t understand people who don’t like GOT like I am ride or die Game of thrones. Made my husband watch it and he loved it if he didn’t I was about to leave his ass. ❤️❤️❤️
😂🤣🥰
I haven’t watched it yet but I’m glad I waited now I can binge watch the entire thing without waiting at all well once this season is over of course.
never had a thought about watching games of thrones
Yaaas! I wanted to die after the red wedding. I gasped when it happened. I stopped watching for like a month.
Another miss about not having mattes us that many GoT fans are middle aged.  Its more flattering if we have matte brow bone highlight. But im still excited and i am pretty advanced with makeup so it doesn't need to be beginner friendly for me.
❤️
I love you
🐲🐉
🐲🐉
Red wedding.... WTF just happened
Im Sha-quiche 😳☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️😂😂😂
I love game of thrones but personally I think Ivan decay should have done 4 smaller eyeshadow pallets. I wouldn’t use all the shades in the big pallet and it would bring down the price
Love youuuu!
I do like game of thrones. However I have to be in a very focused mood to watch it otherwise I look down at my phone for 2 minutes I look back up & now 5 people are dead. What! It’s very political & a lot of back stabbing. Overall though, yes I like it.
Uhhh but Battle of the Bastards thoooough
I actually stopped watching GOT after witnessing the red wedding i was so shook. Now I’ve started all over at season 1.... may have to skip the red wedding episode. Lol
I was able to get the pallets but nothing else online 😐 really want the brushes. Anybody know if they are going to be in stores?
I have never seen a second of game of thrones. So I’m sitting here wondering what chair of swords is for
Love you
💖💖
You're FUCKEN GREAT!
Worst deaths were Hodor and the Dire Wolves

Go sis
The first time I watched game of thrones I didn’t like it because of all the sexually graphic scenes and language but after a few seasons I’ve matured and can handle watching it and I love it now!
“Hold the door!”
Happy bday
Pinchi GORGA TE AMO
I wannnttttt !!!
Massive fan of game of thrones, but hate daenerys.
OMG! The Red Wedding was a crazy episode! I can’t wait until this month when the last season starts!
Yeah! RED WEDDING really Shoooktt me hard. It took me days to get over it.
If u dont watch or even like game of Thrones  then ur juss not human that show is life juss saying and this makeup is life
I have a challenge for you. 24 hours doing make-up.
You can take a 10 minutes break every 1 hour. You can do anything, but you have to do it while doing your make-up. You can do someone else's make up. Please do this! Ily ❤️
I really wanna see the winterfell snow over a black outer cat eye shadow look.
I’m leaving a comment because Manny told me so
Yaaaasssss
❤️❤️❤️
Eres muy divertido, me encanta ver tus vídeos

Why haven’t all your subs left yet like tf
🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲daddy 🐲🐲🐲🐲
Looove!
yaaaassss
Arya & the hound are my faves. But I’d let sex stump Greyjoy nub me down
🐲🐲
I do not like GOT. Too historic, a lot of sex, too many dialogues and a little action. That is my whys.
COOL I LIVE IT
Ily 💙
Delusional=Delirious.
i work security there....stop wearing make up its poison to your skin...and why do you follow these pagans...put this on your face to hide who you are...be original if someone dont like it maybe they should hide from themselves..... urban decay is the name should this not be a warning sign for those who are not under its control.....
I Love It...
🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲
My daughter and I LOVE your channel! Im not a girly chick and I'm so glad that u can show us both about makeup. I wondered as well why some don't like GOT...
Gorgeous carita!
I don’t know what made me laugh more :”Reggaeton” for Raegal, , “Oh my GoT” or “I bent the knee, elbow and toes” , “Sansa get it together momma just like on the show.”
❤️❤️❤️❤️
SNAPCHAT 🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲
i have no way of watching it because i dont have HBO and i cant afford it
So cute
Plsss do a review or how to on the closet set up!!!!!!
🐉🐲
🐉🐲
YOUR LOOK TODAY IS SO FREAKING PRETTY! WASN'T SO SURE AT FIRST BUT IT IS KINDA MY FAVORITE LOOK RN. JON SNOW IS OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE'S FAVORITE!
🐲🐲🐲
🐲 Personally I'm digging the background. It feels like an accentuation of palette! Would not mind more videos with this. Makes it feel like deconstruction Manny 🦄
House Targaryen...I love your videos and I'm loving the new you mi amor
Can we just get married already? The things I would do 😝😘❤️💦 xxx
Ive never watched game of thrones and I FEEL NO SHAME.
I truly appreciate your reviews I don’t feel like you’re trying to push us into buying something but I also feel like you understand there are people behind the brands as well with feelings👌🏼
Very jealous of that fly. Shes living her best life at Mannys house. Really love the makeup storage in the background. Congrats on your new house and all of the success you have had. Always love your videos. They make me crack up all the time
okay but imagine if a brand did a harry potter themed collection and split the palette into the 4 houses 😫
Absolutely love you Manny 💜💜💜!  You were the first make up channel I ever watched and I still love your videos!
Do a Blue Blood review 😎
Love u manny ❤️
I used to hate on Game of Thrones when I first watched; it was only cause the whole time I was mentally downplaying while watching so I couldn't pay attention completely.
But once I removed my mental blockage and bias, I was able to actually connect with the characters and their arcs. So many amazing layers to the show.
OMFG YESSS!!! When I saw the Red wedding I was SPEECHLESS kept asking myself why why why?!?!??! Literally DIED with Robb Stark 😢😢🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
What is up with your editing? There are so many jump cuts it was hard to watch
I couldn’t watch it after “red wedding”
Jon Snow could eat me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i love manny
💗
<3
Pinche swords!
I love it
🐲🐉snapchat
Love your new background 😍💕
Ahhh!!! Manny thank you so much for reviewing this collection!! I was on the fence on those eyeshadow brushes, cuz jebus 28 bucks is cray.  Don't think I need em lol thank you again!
Arya is my fave cause of how she stand up on her own and how independent she is and she learn tons of things💖 love her so so much❤
the red wedding really made me want to quit watching like, YES I WANTED TO DIE. but still love game of thrones😭😭❤️
I LOVE THE BACKGROUND!!!!!!! AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY MANNY I LOVE YOU!!!!!
Can you do a beauty room tour please so we can see  what holds ur makeup.
Manny same. My favorite are dany and Jon
Omfg....when Manny said, "hold da door" shit got me DECEASED!!! Poor Hodor but, a true fan can't help but to laugh at all the "Hodor" jokes & memes! 😂😂😂
My fav has to be Tyrion Lannister he’s smart kind he’s got it all figured out but I mean John is hot lol
I have missed GoT so much
I wanted to die at the red wedding but revenge was had
I will buy that entire collection for collecting lol I may use some but for sure collect no shame
i literally died when you said regeton
I don’t watch GOT because we don’t have hbo, or anyway of accessing it unless we pay for it or rent it. I watched like the first 3 seasons because I bought second hand or rented it but then I fell so behind that I gave up
I could never be friends with someone that doesn't like G.O.T....
Blend
🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲
Im such a huge GOT fan and makeup feen so im definitely going to get it. But my inner critic does think the pallette layout is a bit cheesy. I get its a collector piece but a cardboard pop up throne. And all tge bulkiness. I would have loved a more chic packaging.  Like the urban decay elements pallette.  A hard case. I think they just wanted to put the throne of swords somewhere in the collection for the fans. Which they should it would be stupid not to but it would have been practical if they made brush holder. This was clearly a miss. Manny i love your pallettes. And you clearly have an eye for design. How would i go about breaking into the cosmetic industry? I want to work with brands on creating packaging.  I want to be part of the creative team. Hire me. Lets schmooze GOT so your brand can do a makeup collection of game of thrones.
If you haven’t seen the latest episodes, the comments are full of spoilers. You have been warned.
🐲🐉🐲🐉🐲🐉🐲🐉🐲
Thanks for showing the detail of the make up closer at the ending I appreciate just the extra couple seconds so I can see the texture up close better. ❤️❤️
Your videos make my day lmao amazing 😙😍😙
Oh my god I love his shelves in the back it looks amazing
I dont watch Game Of Thrones, never have, probably because I'm scared of being dissapointed by my high expectations. But I'm totally living for this look and review. Yaaasss gurll.💖
Love it! I took a break from rewatching season 7 to watch this video! 🐉
Idk, but i feel like the teal colour eyeliner might look good too
Ur smile is so beautiful 💕
When a highlighter is too dark for my complexion I will actually use it as a pop of color on my eyes. My favorite is to do a halo eye and use the deeper highlights in the middle.
LOVE GOT AND YOU!!!!!
I’ve been watching your videos for years now, I even got my mamá to watch you too, COOL PENDEJA love u
Omg I LOVE GOT! Obsessseeeeeddd! I def feel the same about Daenerys, she's my favorite.  😍😍😍 bish better get that throne😂 ohh and I def feel the same about the Red Wedding.... it was terrible. Then I was too happy with what happened to Geoffery lmao and how Arya ended last season
I am not rude😂😘😁
Happy birthday!!!!!
Let me shake some of ya'll to the bone..... I have yet to see any part, or whole, or trailer for GOT.
I am wanting to read the books before I watch the show.  The books are on my summer reading list.  :)
My favorite charter is Davos Seaworth. I don’t know why but I really liked his relationship with Shireen. Don’t get me wrong I love Daenarys and John too
💕
🐉  🐉
🐲🐲🐲🐲
Omg that comment about “f**** your sister” and then saying “that’s too far” 😂😂😂
Love GOT! Only 7 more days and I can't wait! ❤❤
Loooove your review...I'm also a big fan or GOT and Urban Decay. My favorite character is Daenerys...and also Lyanna Mormont, that girl is a f*cking badass!
My favorite character will always be the hound ! He really grew on me throughout the seasons ❤️
I love game of thrones!! Such a good show.
I would have loved to see you use the brushes and the eyeliner. Never seen GOT. Busy catching up on anime and manga.👄💜
I love your new storage💜🤩💜
😍😍😍 i loved everything.  Big fan GOT. Babe already know what i want for my birthday . 😁
He just wasted that fly! 😂😂 I love it.
i’m so drunk watching this right now and i’ve laughed the whole video. don’t mind me!! i love you!
Hey Manny how many of your teeth did you get veneers for? I just watched Glam and Gore's video and Mykie was talking about how she's getting fang veneers and just wanted to know about the steps and procedures involved with getting veneers. I'd really like to know.
For me personally, I can’t watch GoT. I’m just too sensitive of a person, like I get way too over emotional over TV 😂 I was pregnant when the Starks died, and so my hormones combined with that moment made me like 😱😱😱 (like seriously you kill a pregnant woman?! I died inside) and I was so heartbroken, I couldn’t watch anymore. I just can’t. I can’t take it when main characters that I fall in love with die off. But I can understand why people love the show!
Hahhaahahhahahahhaa te pasas de lanza con tu español, lo amooooooooo🤩 desde que empezaste a usar palabras en español me atrapaste. "The carita" 🤣🤣🤣🤩🤩🤩 love it.
🐲 so much yes 😍
My favorite character of Game of Thrones is Arya she is kick ass by far
You’re gonna hate me but I have never seen a single Episode of GOT... I just can’t commit to watching so many seasons. Plus Idk where to watch it even if I wanted to.
Love ya ❤️❤️❤️❤️
🐲 I haven’t watched it because I can’t understand the first English that it’s in.
What do i think? Youre so FUNNY and such a hottie!!!!!!!!!!!
Cant watch Game of Thrones way to graphic for me. The first time I watched it I didnt know what it was about and I started to watch it with my 13 y son and then the sex scenes came on and I was hurting myself trying to turn the TV off and of course I couldnt find the remote. It was funny. I havent watched it since and I wont. Too much for me.
I don’t like Game of Thrones because I watched Vikings before and had high high expectations on Game of thrones to be exact the same but even more Viking-vibe, but it’s so much fictional in it. And Vikings is more real, I mean the woman’s can defend them self, but I have also just watched 3 episodes of GOT, but I just don’t like it... Vikings is more my jam! 😍🤩🙌🏻👏🏻 wish some makeup brand did something like this with Vikings because I would really fox with that.. 😍👏🏻 and I’m also that person if everyone loves something I like have to hate it 😂😂 just because I want to be different, I often don’t like things that everyone else loves.
Manny MUA shouting out my literal queen, Jamie G. I LIVE 😩😩🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤😭😭😭
Low key LOVE this back drop for you!
Yesss do a vid on it!! The storage is beautiful ❣❣❣
True!!!! to watch GOT you need to focus the entire time! I love GOT and love u too manny 😊
I LOVE the new storage!!! I would definitely love a video showing it off more! I think it is a really pretty backdrop too!
I LOVE GOT, it's the only show my husband and I watch together. But I have a whole list of characters I love lol I can't pick just one. But my husband's #1 is the hound
I love you the most manny lol you’re losing it tho lol you need rest love
god i wish i would have got a notification on time, i would have called out of work just so i could watch it immediately 😂 now i’m late
Love, love, love GOT. The Red Wedding was freaking shocking. I kept saying what? What? What the hell is going on?!?
Just wanted to let you know that you are hilarious! LOL. The only one that can get me serious to bursting out laughing in a second! LOL! 😘
I stopped watching for 4 episodes after the red wedding I literally died inside
I loveeeee loveeeee loveeeeeeeeeeeeee the storage as your backround
✨🖤✨🌙
Hi I'm new to the channel
Love you manny

Literally feel exactly the same way!!!!!
FOR THE 🏠 @gabrielzamora !!! You got to Manny!!!
I have never seen game of thrones. The make up looks amazing ☺️
luv the eye look you did 🐲🐲 i like the highlighter as well 😘😘
Game of Thrones is not a good show
Please @ me
Love the look....I just think it's a little pricey for me. Love you Manny.
GoT is life! Dany, Jon and Aria 😍😍😍
Hilarious 😂 , i love your videos 💜
17 shimmers and 3 mattes lol not practical at all for just using one palette like if i was using other palettes with it maybe but that defeats the point
Literally just realized that we have the same bday ❤️ made my day 🐲💋💋💋
I absolutely love Daeynarys Tygarean! And of course Jon Snow! I’m so excited for the new and finally season! My bf and I watched season 1-7 in 11 days!
My boyfriend made me watch the red wedding episode with him and told me it was his favorite episode so I thought something good happened and then he recorded my reaction of me literally sobbing
I would love to see a video about your new makeup storage!!!
Love your videos Manny!
🐲🐲🐲🐲😍😘
OMG I LIIIIIIVE 😍😍😍
🐉🐲
🐲🐲🐲
You always make me laugh, love your videos so much. I also love the background would definitely like a video about it 💕
I love GOT, I'm loving these urban decay GOT products.
How do you go about designing storage like that thru ikea??
Love love love GOT!! Rewatching it all before the last season. I love Aria!!! She is such a badass bitch! Your eye look is amazing here!
I’m loving the background 😍
I MUST get this collection! 😭
the lip and cheek stain would be perfect for someone doing sports or any event where it is not practical to wear traditional makeup
🐲🐉 love you manny ❤️
Love game of thrones took the day off just to watch the premiere on the 14th! Hahaha. 🐲🐲🐉
I swear I wish we were best friends! I love u!
I'm honestly not the biggest fan of game of thrones. I have tried watching it but I cannot get into the show...I loved the books though they were great.
L0VEEE Y0UR VIDE0S BAE !
I love the pink duo chrome color on you a lot!
Your makeup storage is goals ugh
Love u Manny!
The red wedding was terrible!!! Rob stark was my favorite character on the show and I was looking forward to plenty of scenes with him half naked to get me through these cold Michigan nights but my hopes and dreams were crushed that episode 😫😓😥
Love you Manny!
Happy birthday  Manny!
🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
🐲🐲🐲
Love you so much Manny!! Only positive energy coming your way!!
Finally someone doing a review on the collection that actually watches GoT 😍
Here for Manny! Happy birthday handsome😍
I love the eye palette, I love GOT and I love you! ❤
🐲 love this video! I couldn't get into GOT...only watched a few episodes...maybe I'll try it again at some point!
stopped watching after the red wedding, I couldn't go on
I literally gasped when you gave the price for the pallet. I wanted to want to get it but no thanks 🙈 huge GOT nerd here ❄️⚔️🏰
36 for the highlighters is only 12 for each shade-sounds more  reasonable
Anything for GOT😍
Like the background
I swear you are the first YouTuber, who has reviewed this collection that I have watched so far who has actually watched Game of thrones and pronounce the damn name 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Personally I am gonna wait til supernatural is over to watch game of thrones because Supernatural is my show and I have been watching it for YEARS but once it is over I am gonna see what the deal is with game of thrones
you need to watch it more than once to fall in love with GOT
I would like a mini version of your shelves for my bathroom or bedroom.
A lot of palettes now are heavy with glitter and shimmers and no transition colours. WHY? Is it because they are the ones that catch your eye first when shopping
🐲🐲🐲 i love you 🐲🐲🐲
Same don’t watch game thrones but here for you Manny !!!!!! My birthday is April 2 ! Aries ♈️ squad!!!!!💋💋💋💯💯💯
If anyone is watching GoT and is lost, well, we all are! 🙃 Let's not lie. However, if you want an easy way to understand aspects of the show, or would like a great fan-theory aspect, go to, "Talking Thrones" YT channel.
🐲🐲🐲
🐲🐲🐲
I just want to say thank you so so so so much for all the birthday love! It means the world to me! I love you guys so much! 🤗
I saw people saying omg manny mua is broke he’s moving and selling his home. Now he’s in a mansion. Ok sis work
Nobody:
Me:Waits for Mr.Kate to help Manny with his house
Seeing a fellow Mexicano thriving and being so successful gives me so much motivation to do better for myself. Manny estoy tan orgulloso de ti ❤️🇲🇽
This is gorgeous, congratulations. Since you don’t drink maybe make the bar a coffee bar ☕️. 
Hope you do a video for when ikea comes and a decor vid.
“I take one, nick takes three” that had me dedddd😂
You should get sheer white curtains for your bedroom! You get privacy and beautiful natural light 😁
GET LIKE TWO GOLF CARTS TO TAKE THE TRASH DOWN!! We have a huge driveway and one golf cart saves so much time
You could just hang some curtains in your bedroom instead of blinds so you can open or close them whenever you want. I think they're wayyy cuter than blinds as well😄
nobody: 
manny: I ASKED THEM IF I COULD KEEP THE FURNITURE
When he asked him to tie his shoe I DIED!! Manny should hire me as his assistant! I would tie his shoes! 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️ Love you Manny!!!!!!!!!
GREAT HOUSE!!  Beware of predator birds such as hawks when Zaya is in the back yard.
This is the subtlest clapback/flex to everyone who thought Manny was going broke 😂.

Lux, what's up?
Washer and dryer on the SAME floor as your bedrooms. 😍😍
You should do a video with a chef coming into your home and teaching you how to cook
Yes I felt like I was 12 watching MTV cribs again
taking the trash out 3 miles away keeps you humble & I love that for you
Patiently waiting for Mr. Kate or the Queer Eye team to go and decorate the entire house 👀
OH Manny 🎂🥤🍾💖💗
WOW I LOVE YOUR GLASS HOUSE. THE KITCHEN ITS MY DREAM. ENJOY UR BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.
OMG I loved your house! 💕💕💕 One day I'll have a big house like this for me and my family <3
“The hawks are gonna get you” 😂😂
The sliding door is called a barn door i'm p sure
I'm so super duper proud of you! You deserve every inch of that place 😊 You've worked so hard & overcome so much shit. Such a proud moment 😭
“Where the magic happens. By magic I mean sleep.”

🙌🏽🤣🤣
wow manny, this is the life! ❤️ i am so so happy for you!
“And by magic, I mean sleep” literally
“... a SHITTER if you will” 😂

The part where you took the bin alllll the way down the driveway KILLED me. 
Love the house by the way!
Check out French Farm house I think u will love it!😍
Beautiful home, I LOVE your T-shirt!! xo
Congratulations, Manny! Your place is beautiful!
In your bar area, could you set up a latte lounge? Like all things for coffee, espresso, frappe, cappuccino etc?
"So gay I love it"
Omfg mood😂🤣
Yess show us the IKEA build babe! ❤❤ love the house and always love seeing you live your best life! 🥰😘
Congrats, sis!👏🏼 Before you even said anything, I was already peeping the light fixtures 👀💕✨.  Loving all the accent walls, & just overall the vibe!😊

P.s.: when you decide to decorate "its very nice just as is" please please can you do a giveway on some furniture pieces 😍😍 
Meaning can i get a couch 💯😉
No one:
Manny: I LOVE BALLS!!! 

Also no one:
Manny: it’s big.. I like it big
Mannys vibe is literally so happy right now & honestly I’m so happy for him bc he deserves this !! 💗
You should invite a professional chef to teach you a few dishes 💁🏻‍♀️, Bar area could be your “Smoothie Bar”
So happy for you mama!!...where nick tho♥️♥️
HOUZZ is a really good tool for decorating, getting ideas, and having the community give you their feedback on what looks best!!
Super bella tu casa!!!! Btw, loooove your “Pendeja” t-shirt from the other video.  Saludos, desde Puerto Rico 😘.
Your new home is peaceful and relaxing! All that natural light is wonderful. I'm thrilled for you and your brother! Time for some cooking classes! 😘😎🌞🎉
i love that he gives a tour while holding his little dog it’s so gay lmfao iconic 😂
Just imagine him hitting you up on Grindr like “ hey wussup bro come over and let’s bang” and then you show up to this mansion...
YOUR NEW HOUSE IS AMAAAZIIINNG!!!
btw I love your T-shirt :)
U go gurrlllll. Beautiful 🏡.
The black skidding wooden door is called a pocket 🚪.
Wish all the best & stay u boo❤💜💜💜😘😘😘😘😘
Manny taking down the trash can is the most relatable...
Haters: Manny is broke and homeless.
Manny: So this is my wine closet.
❤ Love your new place Manny you look so happy.
Happy belated and so so happy for your beautiful home.! You deserve amazing things💕

Your house is stunning and I can’t wait to see how you decorate it and make it you own. You are an amazing person and I can’t wait to see what else you have coming
Manny, just a suggestion but you should have a desk setup in front of all your makeup storage, not only would it motivate you to keep it clean, it would be a fun background
It’s beautiful! Congrats!
the trash can scene reminded me something off of the office and i loved it, this was the most entertaining house tour, it showed what we wanna see and not like inside cabinets😂 love you mannyyyy🤩
Hi manny! Can I rent your backyard for my wedding! 😩😍🙏
Sick place Manny! 

The wall decor is very ‘hobby lobby’ lol
Manny that house is gorgeous but you are distracting me! You are the most beautiful person ever!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
When you popped out of the pillows!!! I died!! I love you!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

"Where the magic happens and by magic I mean sleep" 😆😆
You've become so much more gay since I've last watched you. I like it.

You deserve it Manny! Congrats. I'm a little worried about your security though after posting such an extensive home tour!
Great idea on keeping the furniture. It looks real good until you put your touch into it. Congrats on the beautiful house!!
It's a BEAUTIFUL place! The trash situation sucks, tho. 😉😘
Theres nothing better than having a house that fits your needs. May you and Your gorgeous house be full of blessings and good vibes. ❤️ you dont drink but you can send me the wine
Congrats & happy birthday! You deserve the world babe. ❤️

I assume this is an upgrade from where you were and a bit more private?  Looks beautiful
Btw, infinity pool, it's a great idea! I tag you in a picture on Instagram... <3
wait when Manny jumped out the bed LOL deadass didn't even notice you was in there mannnnnn hahahahah
I love it. You look so freakin happy Manny, you deserve this!!! I know what you mean by all the little things,  like a laundry room and car garage. So happy for you xoxo
I love this manny!!! Thanks for sharing! And I loove you’re personality very humble 👌🏼 you’re message in the end was everything and gave me more motivation to work harder on my new channel here thank you! 💕💕💕💕
So Gay ... I love u 💕💕 Manny eres tan chistoso 😂🥰 congratulations 🎊 you deserve all in the world 🤗💕
Congratulations Manny.  What a great situation you walked into....fully furnished.
I think what would make it home is decorating with things you love, both old and new. Things that speak to you...
I feel that Manny has the best and most natural sense of humour out of all the gurus.
so happy for you manny :) you deserve every part of it after what you've been through :) xoxo
Come through , you are doing well and we are happy for you, stay focus on your brand and dont let anyone give you any hard time, hugs from Colombia, dreams do come true!!!!!

Have Mr.Kate decorate for you!   Btw I love you manny you’re so inspirational 💕
Lmaooooooo I love this it’s like a tour of “here’s my house I won’t use any of it for what it’s intended”
Your house is beautiful. I hope you make more memorable memories.
beautiful house! congratulations!!!!
This house looks absolutely amazing! Good for you!
Master bathroom I was expecting you to say “a his and his section” 😉
Yaaaaaas! Decor videos with before and afters of spaces🙌🙌
I truly hope you see this !!!! 
For your room you should get those blinds that open on their own. You set them to a certain opening time that way at night you have privacy.
You should buy a golf cart or whatevah, to haul the trash bins down. 😊 I remember watching a YouTuber do that, with a 4wheeler because their driveway was so extended.
Omg I cant with the cribs style 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is probably the most amazing house tour EVER..... ( manny bursts out from behind pillows) yaaaasss queen ✨
Colab with Mr.Kate again 🙌🏼 for decor
Get chef to teach u to cook make it happ that be kool a cooking session with manny lovely house wow I’m jelly congrats manny n love u so much 🥰💋💋 xx your my fav youtuber must’ve watched u for long time now n amazing how much you’ve grown xx

That 'Protect Trans Kids' t-shirt is giving me life and melting my heart....keep being good Manny!💗
If I could give this video a thousand likes, I would. CONGRATULATIONS MANNY!!!!🤗🤗🤗 gorgeous house. Thank you for sharing it with us. Love you😘
Sis be careful so you don’t get robbed 100% not by me, obvi, but uk?
Your bathroom door is called a 'barn door' 😉 I got you!
Omg, Manny! I love your house 😍 & as an interior designer in training... 😜 the designer did a great job picking the furniture, glad you kept it! ❤️❤️❤️ looooveee! There is a few things you should change to fit your style buuuut that’s all on you hunn 💕but you should get curtains for decoration since you prefer waking up to sunlight, just so you’re windows don’t look plain 👌🏽🌙 Im curious what’s your style? Modern, Midcentury, Scandinavian, Mediterranean, etc.?
Manny: I don’t know how to cook
Me: YOU HAVE A GORGEOUS STOVE AND A PASTA ARM... come on manny...
You could buy clear glass/plastic kitchen cannisters (for sugar/flour, etc) and use them for your tub area..put Epsom salts, bath bombs, etc inside...they are functional and decorative.  Love @kimmylongston ❤️
Love..love your new home!!! So Gorgeous 💙
I love you Manny and this video is amazing!
You know Laura will help decorate! She's so good at it!

I remember you San Diego small room. Tiny vanity station
Manny this is beautiful! So nice you move into a move in ready home. We have been in our home for 15yrs and we have ended up completely rebuilding our home and it took 14yrs to get my beauty room once all the kids were grown and out! Now my home is just how I pictured it when we bought it,as far as remodeling and building on. Also that room off your kitchen is a butlers pantry. 😉
Congrats Manny! You look so happy in your new space
Your new crib is so damn dope!!!😍
Popping out of the pillows got me 🤣😂 but I love this video house looks beautiful ❤️
And everyone was saying he was poor 😂 

Upgrade ☑️
Hi manny! Are you planning on keeping all of those couches?? Because I desperately NEED a NEW COUCH! 😂😂😂
Your home is so beautiful, congrats Manny!
For the trash cans you could get a golf cart to help with that you have an amazing house get the toys to match also you could get the team from practically perfect to help organize your stuff congrats
I’m so happy for you manny! For working so hard and achieving your goals and reaching places you probably never saw possibly when you were younger! 
I think a cool video idea would be Laura lee helping you decorate a room or two, sense she knows your so well and is pretty good at decorating!
I love your house thanks for bringing that “cribs” vibe back  🤗
Holy shit I enjoyed the shit out of the video it felt sooo much like My Crib from MTV 😂😂😂🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 congrats this house is amazing and it feels so calm and just enjoyable ❤️❤️

Why was the intro like MTV cribs 😂
Who else thinks Mr.Kate should redo mannys new house? 🙋🏼‍♀️
I LOVE THIS pls show us an update soon!!
Houses like this are beautiful!! My Mexican ass is happy with our half an acre land lol I already have to clean quite a bit. We have 7 cars so it's kind of nice not having to worry about a small driveway lol not to mention our backyard that just goes into the woods lol it's a lot of grass to mow. Congrats though!! Upgrading is always a blessing!! Your house is beautiful, can't wait to see it become a home. ❤️❤️
So beautiful! Congrats on your success!
@MANNY please do an updated house tour ♥️♥️

Love it!!! This video is for all the haters talking shit saying you lost your home....super happy for you ❤️
The house is so beautiful

"The hawks are gonna get you" 😂
Congratulations your home is a beauty 🤗🤗👏👏
I never want your videos to end, all of your little diva comments make my day❤️
Such a great place! Congrats! And please do film them builind the ikea closet because I've been saving up for months to buy the pax system I made on the website.
This “humble adobe” though 😍😍
Just wanted to drop a quick comment and say happy belated birthday Manny! I actually just had my son yesterday (on your birthday) at 5:36am! 💙
Pinterest honey! They have so many cute and awesome bathroom ideas!! 😍
God Bless you in your new home wishing you much more success
As an Aussie... keep the koala 🐨 ❤️

In terms of style, Hamptons... koala Hampton’s! Yaaaas!
YES!! new beauty room tour/organization/makeup collection!!
I freaking love you! 😂
Congratulations!!!!!  Your place looks amazing!!!!  I wish you many happy times in your new home!!!!
I love how happy he seems in this video and also his last couple of videos also congrats on the new home and the editing on this video is so funny lol
Congrats! Your home is beautiful! And, like someone mentioned... you can get a golf cart to run down the trash! So much easier 😉
Your home is so beautiful!!! Makes me pray 1000x times harder and hope that my family can get a home.
I love you , I’m soooo proud of you and happy , you deserve the best ❤️
Congratulations on your new home. 💗
Congrats manny! Beautiful home 🥰
Congratulations on your beautiful house! The stage furniture really seems to match you well. Can't wait to see more decorating videos!
"The hawks are going to get you."
Lmao, the image of a hawk just swooping down and grabbing her... I can't 😂😂😭😭
💞💞💞🎉 CONGRATULATIONS on your new home! 🎉💞💞💞 goals af 💯
I love balls... you know, it’s just very me  🤣🥰
I would LOVE to see a beauty room tour when you finish!!! I like modern decor. Also, with the bathroom, you can talk to Jaclyn Hill because her bathtub is super tranquil!
Congratulations on your new home!! It’s stunning!! I love watching you and all you’ve accomplished!! If you ever need a new assistant I’m available lol!! Love you Manny!! 💗💗💗
I'm glad that you were able to get into a bigger space. I'm glad you were able to do this, I love you! Keep striving for greatness!
Not that you asked for an opinion... but I totally think that the pool should go by the beauty room. Lmao love ya Manny 😆
Idea, buy a little 4 wheeler and attach a little wagon in the back to move the trash cans ?  😊😁

Anyways beautiful house ! You deserve it and I hope god blesses you with much more ! 😍❤️🌹
Love the house!! More spacious than the old one.
As soon as you mentioned the chicken wire out back I was honestly so relieved 😅😂 🐶
SO happy for you Manny- love you and love that you have overcome!!
you should keep the natural light in your bedroom!! it’s so refreshing
No one: 
Me: i would so smoke on that balcony
Congrats on your new place.  It looks like decorating fun! I wish I could!  There's so many memories waiting to be made, so embrace the change.
I love how humble simple and genuine you are❤️😘
Hahah MTV cribs style! I love it 😂
Can I live with you? 🤣
okay mijita! i see you! im sooo proud of you Beautiful place.
Awww Manny your so handsome and silly. Love your vids, congrats on the new digs.
One suggestion for the trash can situation, get a riding lawn mower or ATV and hook em up together like a little train and drive them all down together. That'll make it faster and funner.👍🏽🚜🗑🗑🗑🗑
So proud of you manny!! Congrats!!! Homeless where????🤷🏽‍♀️🦋🦋🦋
Congratulations!  I'm so happy for you!
Love the house! Have mr. Kate come back!!
Congratulations!! It’s a beautiful home!
Taking out the trash had me CRINE
For your bathtub you should do what Jaclyn hill did and buy empty glass jars / containers and put different bath salts in them ❤️
Congratulation Manny!!
also congrats on your new beautiful home
I’m so happy for you!!! The house looks amazing!!! I know how difficult it is to move but everything works out. Hope you had a wonderful birthday Manny!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh god I'm so poor. Beautiful house.
Your New Home is stunning!Just be patient it will be stunning soon!Love you Zia and manny!😘🐩🐶
Congrats I LOOOOOVE your new house.
Hire Rebecca Robson on YouTube she is freaken amazing and lives in San Diego.
Congratulations on your new home.  It’s beautiful.
Have luscious come help you decorate! I wanna see you collab again. She's the whole reason I started watching you.
I laughed so much - you better film everything - we need home update videos all the time ☺️ xxxx
Gorgeous home. Feels very tranquil and serene. Simple and elegant. I suggest you add candle votives around your bathtub. Create a spa theme atmosphere and add a little pop of color here and there. Think about how you want each room in your home that represents something to you. I remember Nate Berkus said something along those lines that your home reflects how you live as a person. Something like that.
Congrats for your new accomplish,
You’re so down to earth and are always keeping it real! Congratulations on your new home 🙃🙂
I have the SAME patio furniture!!! Love it.
Uuuuh you got thicccc😏 and i mean this in the best and nicest way possible
Congrats on your new, amazing, wonderful and fabulous place!!!!!!
LOVE! It's so light and airy and homey!
How about a Greek Goddess Theme ?????!!!!👀👀👀🚨🚨🚨 
That would be so dope and fit your style so well.
Hook the handle of the trash can to the ball of the hitch on that truck👀🙋🏼‍♀️ I have a .5 mile drive way...or exercise 🤷🏼‍♀️
congratulations!! it's a beeaauutiful home <3
I will be your platonic wife any day of the week 😍
so happy for you!!! God bless
💞🎉🎈 Happiest birthday wishes Manny! Your house is beautiful! I hope we get More vlogs & more of YOU this year! ✨🎉

DM me id love to help you with your decorating!!!
Awww manny I’m so happy for you! 🤗🤗
Wow so nice and so happy for u it's gorrrr love it 😍
Your bar should be a "Makeup Bar" unopened or unused anything of everything for beauty that you don't want. So when friends or family they can take it off your hands. Just an idea but love the idea for Fiji water in wine cooler. Love your new home.😊💗 Extremely happy for you.
Hard work pays off! Good for you Manny! Absolutely beautiful home!
After rewatching this, i think some farmhouse decor would be really cute! It would just tie in with all the unique light fixtures and that sliding door especially!
when you were taking the trash can down i got hardcore parks and recreation vibes and i loved it
Manny I stg if you don't have an entire room decorated in Sailor Moon, I'm unsubbing 😂
Holy caca Manny,  you have a pot filler!
Yes, I want to see it, can you do a makeup collection too???
pleaze record the building of ur closet system
Beautiful place Manny. I Love it!
“I like balls” 🤣😂 you’re hilarious Manny.  I love the elephant photo! Why it’s in the bathroom, idk that’s strange 🤣😂 If you don’t want it, feel free to send it to me!      
Your house is beautiful Manny     You definitely need to put a pool in. Don’t forget a baby pool for Zaya!
Yay!!! Get it babe keep these videos coming love it!!!
Love ur crib I am so happy for u 😊

First off, Congratulations on your new home!! Secondly, your pupper is adorable!! Third, I love your new house and I love the way it's already  decorated! I'm so glad for you Manny!! ❤😘❤

Manny your house is beautiful! I’m so proud of you and congratulations! 💓
Watching this video and him going into the first bathroom and Manny like "There's an elephant." I cracked up thinking of " the elephant in the room."😆
Congratulations!! So happy for you!!
"Where the magic happens"...yup so MTV cribs lol Love your place! Be careful with owls or other large birds that can carry Zaya off
Taking back to mtv cribs times.😊
Yes show us it being built please !!!
Definitely decorate spa style around your tub. Pull up pics of spa theme bathroom then go to town. I can totally see it now.
Hanging eucalyptus in the shower looks so cool and smells amazing!!
Beautiful home Manny! Love it when people reuse stuff and give it a new purpose.
Youtubers: omg i hate when fans come to my house and stalk me

Youtubers: heres my entire house and exactly where I live and basically everything I don’t want you to see but just want to show off
“I’m dainty, I cant do this” LOVE THAT!
bath salts💀💀

Mid century modern with pops of color. Dark accent walls and gold trim decor.
Omg HB , Thanks for Always making my day you make me laugh so much Zaya is Adorable I hope spelled it right, Love your place Blessed
what a house so pretty!! not sure if the furniture says Manny, its pretty, but its not you.. you should get Mr Kate decorate, you are young and vibrant personality... but overall its beautiful, congrats on your hard earned success!!

Such an amazing house. Congratulations 💙💙 love the video
Love it!!!! Beautiful home!! We are hoping to get a new home this summer or next, the house we live in now is well over 100 or more years old and is starting to fall apart. It's my great grandmas old house. We just dont have the funds right now or we'd of done moved. But my hubby is the only one working with me having to stay with my son due to his issues so it makes it a little harder. But this house runs us 500 plus a month on just electric which doesn't help either🙄 sorry for the rant lol!! I love the new home and your videos! 💕
You should get a HUGE jar full of bath bombs next to the bath tub! ❤️
OMG, that is a long drive way!

Manny’s “It’s so hard saying goodbye” video comment section: 
“I only clicked because I thought you were leaving YouTube, his pallets flopped, he has to move because he’s so broke.. whaaaa”.

This video’s comment section: crickets

This is what happens when petty people get too big for their own good smh.
Oh giiiirrrll I love your shirt 🌈
Where did u get the Zaya pillow you have on your bed! I need that with my pup lol
probably my favorite youtubers house i’ve seen
Anyone else dying to know how much it was to "throw in all the furniture" with the house?! 🤔😉🤩
#SheGotShmoneyyyTho
I love you so much! You’re the cutest
Can we talk about how buff manny kinda looks since hes been going to the gym!
You seriously bring me so much joy! You have the sweetest heart and I just love how close you are with your family. I’m LDS and want to say thank you for sharing your story. Watching what you went through as a young man really inspires me to be even more kind, loving and accepting of everyone! Keep being you because you’re amazing! 😊💙🌈

Hello MTV Cribs 💁🏻‍♀️
Glad you’re no longer homeless, lovely house x
you go boo-boo!!! 
when i got my apartment my most favoritest thing was the laundry room!
Love your house, Manny!!! It's gorgeous!!
My decorating recommendation would be to call Daniel (Mr. Preda) over and do the makeover while you're traveling.
THIS HOUSE IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND HAS A LOT MORE SPACE THAN THE PREVIOUS
Sooooooooo in love with your place!!!! I wanna decorate it so bad!
Yes we want to see that 😍😍
Congratulations on you’re new house and you’re hard work
Happy belated birthday!! We share birthdays btw!! Aries babbiiiesss!! ily
Omg!!! I just poked myself in the eye with my eyeliner 😩 I can’t multi task! You need caution advisory as the beginning of the video my cause makeup problems if you can’t multitask! 😂 2nd time watching this cause the first time wasn’t a success!  Love you videos manny!!! 🤗
I love your new house so much! It's absolutely beautiful and you deserve it! Congratulations!! ❤❤❤
Loving mtv cribs style video!!! Fave!!! 💜💜
Felicidades manny preciosa casa!💕👍😘
I’m DYING at that driveway part 😂
I love your balls. Also with all the beautiful white open areas adding some warm wood pieces would look awesome!
I THOUGHT HE SAID “I can wet my beef in here without asking my brother to do it for me”🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should invite ME ❤️😝
Mazel Tov! May everyday bring you greater joy and renewed success in your new home.
That house is such a blessing for you.  You can have peace when you want or need it, the space you need.  All of it is just wow.  Happy for you Manny.  ❤️❤️🏫🏘️

It’s beautiful! Rustic industrial
It's settled guys, I'm moving. Manny won't even notice me, the house is so big
Get mrkate again 🤙🏽👏🏼👏🏼
Lol I swear he is so adorable!!
You can't say you want makeup brands to have less waste with PR and also want a wall of wasteful plastic Fiji bottles. 😐 I mean my environmentally-friendly par for makeup "gurus" isn't exactly high but jeez.
Get your inspo from Pinterest!!!
Biiiitch your car is so cute af!
Congrats Manny...hard work does payoff...haters will always hate! BTW...Happy Birthday...may God bless you with many more! 🥰🎂🎈🎈🥳🥳
I love your tiny baby dog so much 😭💕💕

Congrats!!! Many more blessings! ❤
Omg yass I wanna see a makeup collection ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love the furniture...you're lucky you barely have to do any decorating now. I love the vibe and that it's not the typical influencer's style of decorating. It's very mature and comfortable but minimal. Congrats and enjoy that lovely house.
Love the OG cribs episode! So great the way you edited it together take me back, now I miss MTV cribs😣😉😎

You should decorate your bathroom to look like your eye palette. A big Medusa inspired gold mirror would look so nice!
I LOVE the Elephant picture!
What kind of breed is Zaya? She is so cute!

Leave the trash cans at the road and get a four wheeler and take the trash bags everyday when it’s full 🤷‍♀️🤪 that’s what we do in Alabama hahaha

I love your house soooooo beautiful and happy belated birthday love . CONGRATULATIONS GORGEOUS!
If you need house inspo pinterest is great. Every time I use it I always get new ideas on how to decorate x
Beautiful Home! Much LOVE from South Texas!
You should get “Runway Done My Way” to help decorate or change a few thing up. She’s really good at that.  Especially since you’re already feeling the decor/style that already exist.
congrats manny ily!
For your bathtub, I love organic bath products. Most of them have a nice aesthetic with their packaging (and they’re good for you). Also, maybe a small plant by the window. If you’re not good with plants, a cactus would be cute.
Love it! So beautiful.
Bohemian Chic!! Light and airy with pops of color and metal!! A style that i think you might like❤❤!
you should put a little black leather couch in the second living room
Love you manny!!!!!! You so deserve it!!!!
Oh yes I’m tryna see a new makeup collection and organization videooooo
Congratulations on your new home, its absolutely beautiful!!! Many blessing for you Manny. Te Amo❤

I don’t get how adults don’t know how to cook...?! I couldn’t imagine lol
Hyperventilating when manny walked over the living room rug with his shoes. No shoes on carpets/rugs!!!

Manny:The furniture was already here. The furniture came with the house. They left the furniture here. Again the furniture came with the house. 😂😂
Love your house it looks great but make it yours decorate it your taste and well I think less stuff is better.
“I don’t even know how to spell cook” 😂😂
More with zaya please💞💞
Take a drink every time manny says “I don’t drink”
Another YouTuber showing off their wealth. Very original.
Love these behind the scenes. Your personality is so funny! So proud of my Manny! ❤
MANNY! I’ll be your interior designer lol but no for reals haha
Ooh! Manny you should get a pool! There’s so much room for one!
Do houses in LA not have basements? I live in the Midwest and any “nicer” house like mannys ALWAYS has a basement
WHO ELSE DROPPED EVERYTHING TO WATCH!?






- small youtuber here
Looking good! The gym is paying off
I like the sweater you were using... you look like a teddy bear.. love your house too
I love boho decor 💕
i think it would be so cute if you got a clear fishbowl with some bath salts in the bottom to put bathbombs in for your bath!!
Crystals for the tub like amethyst and rose quartz! And candles!
Cute house.
Congrats 
I still dont like you.
Nice crib.  Now hire a chef to come in for a few days a week. Bet MamaMUA would enjoy making a few Sunday dinners for her boys.
Leave all the animal prints. The shows you are a lovely soul of nature. They go so will with house you picked. A lot of nature around your place. Have fun with decorating it. I feel some accent colors in pillows would be nice for now but I like the furniture
Well done manny 🖤
I’m dead! 😂😂. Not even done with the video yet, love the place!!! And yes a pool!
I’ve never commented on a social before but yikes hard to watch. One follower out
Love ur house Manny! For the bathroom u should decorate it earthy, like bamboo, some vines, just a earthy feel to u. Maybe get a waterfall to set in the to enjoy while soaking in that tub.
Pretty!!!
Looks like Bell Canyon. Usually when you are winded that fast it means adrenal fatigue/insulin resistance. Watch Dr. Berg.  I would start intermittent fasting.
You’re actually a Savage if you read more 🐐 🐐🐐🐐❤️






Now your 2019 is full of good luck, like to activate!🍀🍀

Łìkè this and śùbśćríbè to me and your bleśśed🙏🏻
I livee 😍
NO BLINDS! The house is way too nice for blinds....Either sheer curtains or blackout curtains for the days you do want to sleep in 💜💋💋 But the house is beyond beautiful! Nice is an understatement 💋
You forgot to show us inside your fridge☺
Manny, good for you! This place is gorgeous! The furniture is also wonderful. So awesome you got to keep it! That view is something you will never get sick of. 
Oh, can I have Zaya? She is adorable and I make my husband look at her every time you show her in hopes I will get one just like her! LOL What is her breed?
Love you the most! 😘
Do you need an assistant?  Iol   I speak both Spanish and English
Congratulations on your new home!! Its absolutely fab!!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the master bath, and the outside area upstairs...and it most definitely needs a pool, but also leave yard room for animals too....but that's a super nice place. Hope you enjoy it and have many great nights and days there :)
Let me do your interior designs!!!!
Very heavy mtv cribs vibes coming from this video.
So anime of you! Lol
Love your house Manny 😍😍
Wow the view though! I imagining myself having my morning coffee in tha backyard. It's beautiful may God let you enjoy every corner of it 💗💗💗
It’s beautiful, love the open airy feel and the exterior views are to die.. congrats to you
You Most definitely need a pool 🏊
I love it 🥰 and I love the animal pictures 😍😍
Can someone clarify, did the furniture come with the house?
I just hate bending down 😂😂😂😂
And a decorating video pplzzz
Congrats on your new house! It is stunning. I can’t wait to watch you turn this house into your home.
Love it!!!
Congrats on the new home!
Beautiful house!!
This house is absolutely beautiful
Beautiful house !!!
I don’t know why but 11:45 reminded me of a scene from the office and I’m here for it😂
Congrats 🍾 I would definitely turn that bar into a coffee bar
Congrats on your new home love I’m so proud of you!❤️
Your dog is my favorite 😂
Gorgeous home 🏡
U need to make merch with the frase “I’m dainty” lol
Mr Kate time 😍
In the bar area, since you dont drink, you could turn it into an espresso/coffee bar
The “it feels good” made me feel like I was watching a sitcom. Made me laugh
have laura decorate your house for you !!
My fav house tour.... I love the fact that you're just so grateful!! You're blessed... Thanks for sharing 🤗❤
lol barbie is in her dreamhouse :D
Love this video style
Wait does tour camera man have long hair?
Silver and grey furniture also lime green decor
Love how light and airy the house is ❤️
Love the new house...so jealous, lol. 😁
Need to do another one when you decorate it yourself!!

Wait, did the furniture come with the house?
I love him 😍
It’s so fucking pretty omg!
I love the set up🤩
‘ I don’t even know how to spell cook ‘ 😂
Yes please show us what the IKEA closet thing looks like. Please and thank you
Your new home is absolutely gorgeous!!! And that view!!! 💗💗💗 Idea for your master bathroom tub...apothecary jars filled with different bath bombs and bath salts.
Congratulations manny!
Do something Over the top do not keep it white and black do some emerald greens 🥰
I love the idea about having bath salts and bath bombs on the side of your tub. A cute little basket for the bath bombs would be nice so you can keep them all in one spot or a little tiered shelf thing so you can have them all on display. I’d also do a tiered thing to display the bath salts too. But I love the new place. Once everything is in its place the house will look stunning
Love it! Just need better lighting in your closet!
Can’t wait to see more videos of your home. I love it so much and happy for you.
Your house is beautimus
I’m calling my toilet a shiter now sounds better
Very nice house. Please watch your dog when you let her outside. It looks like you live in an area that has coyotes.
Yeesss Manny please film them building it!!!!!!!
Congrats hun you did that shitt

I love that elephant art piece on the first restroom!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
You have to get Mr.Kate to help decorate!!!

Does your family work for you(manage you)? I noticed you said my dad and i's desks and you mentioned your brother living with you. That's actually so sweet and the route I would take. Family always has your best interest 🖤🖤 beautiful home

So happy for you💕💕

Put 3 big candles that you can light to relax when you take a bath like going from tallest to smallest
Love ❤️ the new house..
Congrats Manny!
I'm sure my husband wouldn't wanna stare at an elephant when he pees lool love your backyard!
Looks like ash and rowans house would look in eden
Congrats Manny!!! That is a beautiful home!! I would just leave it like that hahahaha takes away all the hard work and the decorations are all nice anyways! 🤣
When I lived in Colorado, our neighbors use to attach the trashcan to the back of their car when they were leaving in the morning so that they could just drop the trash off at the end right before they headed to work.
Manny im your new fan and viewer
I LOVEEEEE THE SHIRT 🙏😍😍😍😍😍
Love you, Manny 🥰
Tbt to mtvcribs😅
Congrats Manny!!! I'm really happy for you!!  Love U! <3
Manny is going to announce his new product in a couple of days and I’m still trying to get the Greek goddess eyeshadow palette and highlight palette!! 😫 I need it!
Happy for you babe❤
you should put some colorful pictures on your living room walls and make the bathrooms all cute with succulents and other green plants
The door to your bathroom is a barn door 😘
Such a beautiful home !
Congrats babyyyyyyyyy omg what a beautyyyyy
I think everyone is so used to seeing  Big Youtubers buy Multiple cars and Mansions that when someone like Manny doesn't they assume they are broke. The size of your house does not show the size of your bank account. It just shows what kind of home you chose to live in not necessarily what you could afford.
your house is so beautiful
Congratulations on your new house Manny you deserve this and more. Yes just makeit your own style it's your house who gives a shit if you dont know how to decorate.. Congrats papas.
Hey Manny your house is soooooo beautiful like you
Love your house!!! I hope you get to this comment. I noticed your backyard is at the edge of a hill and if you are considering a pool make sure to check if your house is vulnerable to landslides. If it is then a pool could trigger a landslide and you'll have to be responsible for the damage and any damage you cause to your neighbors property. You could check on the usgs web page if your property is at risk or hire a consultant. All the best!!💕
Your home is WOW!!!
Let me have your house if you don't cook or drink...lmao...Lovely home...thx for sharing...OMG! I don't know much about you but you're funny...your smart jokes...
Your so cute!!!!! And such an Adultttttttt lol... that walk of shame down that driveway!!!!!!
Love this! So happy you’re happy !
I think a nice design in your house would be like a farm house type of vibe. Love you manny💙
Congrats Manny!
Your house is goals and the furniture is bomb and the kitchen!!! I cant i love it!!!
Love that bathroom spit take lolol
you should buy desi’s photos from africa and put tjose up in your house instead 😂
where did you get that shirt i want it
Just beautiful! I would come watch your dog zeal! So cute!
Love you manny 💜💜💜💜
Looove your house!!😘😘❤️❤️😍😍
So happy for you! Everything looks beautiful. Hopefully one day I can own a home just as beautiful.
I was hoping to see nick’s face 😅
Yes baby yes
Then why have a big house manny. Why don’t you just get a nice condo
Lmao this furniture ain’t it gal
So proud of you! I really hope you like my comment so I know you read my posts!
Esta hermosa tu casa me encanta ese estilo moderno minimalista! Saludos.
How many times can someone tell us the goddamn furniture came with the house...
Just want to say,  happy for you,  even though a lot of people try to shade you with the moving house issue. Work hard and be kind at heart cause the universe will repay that. Have a great life in your new home.
Love the house!
you look so kind social influencer.
manny you look so hot in this video!
hey manny.. did the place come with the furniture or..?
Call  Mr. Kate to decorate your house
u prob wont see this but i have like white see-through curtains over my windows with a pretty design on them and i love it bc its a little privacy but the sun still shines through :))
Love your new home🏡
is this in LA or chula vista
So, ou rented this house. That's why it have furniture.
I love love love all of the animal pictures I love them!
Oh BTW it is Zaya's she is letting you stay because you pay the mortgage. Lol it's all about the dog ya know
i LOVE LOVE LOVE mannys laugh 🥺💞💞 it makes me so happy!!!! 😭
3:20 That's not a bar space; it's actually a butler's pantry. The house is dope. I'm proud of you. I'm totally feeling the water closet in the master bathroom. Having the toilet in the shower/tub area is a quirk for me...
Love the shirt Manny!
Hey do you think your Freddie Mercury having your assistant tie your shoe!!?? Love the house congratulations. Definitely need a pool!!!
ZAYA IS TOO CUTE & CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR HOUSE!!!!
You should put a pool whith a Jacuzzi on the side area and a fire pit at the front, whit a lot of sitting areas so you and your friends have a place to talk at night while looking at the view. You could do a colab whith Sharah from "Live your Style" to make the house more "you",she is realy good and her videos are amazing, her mother also have a YouTube chanel called "Roberson design".
Happy birthday!!!!🎉🎁🎂
Love the master bathroom
i wonder if the furniture came with the house
your home is gorgeous!
Wow such an amazing view and house, I like all the animal art :p
Manny, la verdad es que tienes un cara bella.
Yessss Pool!
does anyone else want to go hard on interior design in his house or is just the Joanna Gaines in me?
4:21 YASS
wow is this what clout chasing gets you? I should try it
Tell me why the part when manny is taking out the trash looks like a scene from Parks and Recreation lmao
The door to the master bathroom are called barn doors
Call Mr. Kate!!!!!
How do you clean the grass pee area that's in the house so it doesn't smell? I got one a long time ago and I couldn't figure out how to clean it effectively without spilling it.
You should do the big glass jars in different sizes around the tub for bath bombs and salts and candles!!! Yesssss Manny love the new house!!! This place seems like it is an instant mood booster LOVVE 🖤
This reminded me a lot of the movie step brothers! I don’t know why 😂😂😂
What about Mr.kate
Talk to Mr. Kate!!!!!!
I bet my life manny won’t reply heart this comment
Check out nathannco .com we sell these great floor mats in amazing prints they are called Beija flor Mats. They are perfect for kitchen, bathroom, front door areas easy to clean they bring a nice pop of color and print to any area, but not outside only in doors 🙂
Yaaay manny !
Sooo sick❤️
Congratulations
Congratulations on your new home! If you want to make your home more you, find an interior decorator unless you have a friend or family member who is good at decorating.
DONT SUPPORT FIJI WATER 🗣🗣🗣🗣
Love it manny
Call Mr. Kate and have them do the bathroom!!
Yessss mtv cribs!!!
Get Mr Kate to decorate
If you get rid of that “gather” sign can you sell it to me 😂
Get Mr. Kate to go over and decorate your house !!!! Would ask make an awesome video. 😉
what would be so FREAKING sick is if you outlined your shelving in your closet with LED lights ;)
Take mr Kate’s What’s your aesthetic? Test 🗣
Yeeesssss
OMG your kitchen is my dream right now!
Bought or renting
nice crib and your dog is soooooo cute<3
Yessss
congratulations
Isn’t it weird to say you like the lights the best. They asked me when my family was looking at it and I was like tbh my favorite part of this entire house is the lights and they were like.... um ok. I’m weird
What kind of dog is Zaha
Mr. Kate should decorate your beauty room it would be so cool to have another room from her in your new home
get it Manny
Hire Mr Kate!!!!
is it also in Calabasas?
8:10 Thank me later
Get a golf cart to take your trash cans out. You could put a bar with hooks on it and take them out, and bring them up. Plus you could use it to check the mail. Love your new place.
Love the house
Pinterest Manny, pinterest
I like the shirt
this was so perfect love you daddy Manny
Bless your new place.... let peace, harmony, prosperity, healthy, love conquer all
God bless your home! So beautiful 😍
I would love to see a beauty room organization/makeover video
“I love balls” lmaooo manny! I love you! 💕
When he popped out of the pillows, I died 😂😂 love you manny!  ❤️
Congratulations Manny!  It is absolutely gorgeous.  Can't wait to see where you put the pool and hot tub!  XOs
You know you’re a dog mom when you saw the fence and was concerned then you said chicken wire and I breathed again!
the hawks are gonna get you 😂😂
Omg I love how your coat matches your fur baby 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Mr.Kate!!!!
Manny... be nice to your little sweet dog, she is trying to get use to a new home and she is trying to stay close to you. She is such a little Sweetheart💕
Or a make - (it my own) - over
I love love love your T-shirt!!!!!!
I’m just so happy! Manny! Look at it! So pwetty!!
Your house is awesome!
Your house looks really beautiful. It is really a wonderful feeling to be an adult in this situation. Take pride honey and enjoy it. I would recommend hiring a decorator because they can really work with you to incorporate your style and desire for the house. They can help you figure out what you want too. Replace all that art with massive Sailor Moon art pieces. Buy from artists :D. Make the bar into a smoothie/snack bar. Pool is definitely a yes.
Would love a closet build
you’re so cute stop
Such a cute home!!
Congratulations Manny!!!! I love, love, love your place!!! It looks so beautiful :)
Congrats manny you definitely deserve it 💕💕💕💕💕
A bathroom for beauty blender 
That's life i always dream for 
So happy for you
Congrats Manny love your place it’s beautiful 💕 and happy bday 🥂
I definitely would add some "green" (plants). Its such an amazing home😍😍😍 on a side note anyone know where to buy that beer painting?  My husband is obsessed with bears and that one would be cool to add
Such a beautiful home enjoy and God bless your new home
The house is beautiful! Maybee try some decor of glass. The house seems to have really nice light coming through it and I think it would look cool with glass reflecting that.
Very happy for you!  Happy  birthday🎂! I love you Manny!
Manny it’s Beautiful!!!!! Best wishes to you
Manny, what kind of car do you have that's in the garage? I'm guessing maybe a Ferrari?
I never comment on house tours... or videos for that matter... unless there’s give aways....but you have a beautiful home manny!
I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So happy for hulu yeyyyy

Literally feel the same about the wash room! My future home needs a damn washroom!! Hahah♡
What’s wrong with the furniture that’s in there? I think it looks great lol. Cozy and classy. That rock wall though🔥🔥
Manny: I love to wake up at 9 am
The rest of the world: wakes up at 5:10 am to real world responsibilities
So happy for you ☺️ I love your bedroom balcony!
What an amazing home...it will definitely take some time to make it your own, but you can do it! Congratulations on this huge accomplishment for yourself...and HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOO❤❤❤🥳🎂
Congratulations on your beautiful house!!!! It’s your dream house. 😊
Congrats manny hour home is beautiful!!
Hire Mr. Kate for the decorating 👏🏻
You should have the guy who does Insane Pools come to a pool for you!! 😍
I think some large glass apothecary jars off of Amazon would look beautiful filled with different colored bath salts and bath bombs. Love the new house Manny! Keep thriving and being the positive, happy, funny Manny we know and love babe! Love you so much 😊😘 also...HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Well done Manny. Its lush😍
You have a beautiful home❤️ I wish I can afford to live on my own.  I wish I didn’t have to be in debt 🥺
I saw ur Chones❣
Congrats Manny on your new home I am excited for you! I hope you had a wonderful Birthday!
Manny congratulations! You deserve all the success. I like that you never forget your family and have them close to you. That is how I know your Mexican.
Can I just go live with you so you won’t live alone 🙃💋
Yesss Rich bitch 😁🤣 i love it! Such a nice House ❤️👍🏻
Lol laundry room in the basement is better than having to use quarters
1) baby. A kitchen like that and you can't cook? That's it. I'm inviting myself over to teach you how to make food.
2) you could make a coffee bar out of that bar area. Or a juice bar! Bowl of fresh citrus and a juicer would look so classy.
3) the door to your bathroom is called a barn door 😂
4) for your tub: succulents succulents succulents! They're so easy to maintain in bathrooms because they require very little water.
Love it. I love color
Happy Birthday babe! Congrats on the new home, it's beautiful!
Love the house! 😍 Congrats on the new home! Also LOL! @ you dragging your trash bin 😂😂😂
I live, I love, I dieeeeee! Obsessed! Congrats on the new home ❤️
Deffo need a bath caddy/tray for your master bath! Also some kind of plant and maybe crystals ?! So pretty! 😍
add swimming pool🤗🙌love u manny❤
in your bedroom you should get long curtains that are like somewhat see through just for a tiny bit of extra privacy and decoration but also will let the light in.
Manny you can always hire Mr. Kate again.. Your home is beautiful and it is so you Manny! Thanks for sharing it with us....
Congratulations!!! What a beautiful home

You deserve this and more!! Also happy birthday babe I hope it was an incredible day 😘
Wow this is super nice and I could see myself in a house just like this. Congrats Manny!
Congratulations 🍾🎉🎈🎊
Maybe a fun idea would to let youtube followers pick certain decorations for your house. Do polls or something to let people vote on what you should buy. 🤷🏻‍♀️ just an idea.
Have mr Kate do a room
You should put art up around the walls drawn by your fans. It doesn't even necessarily need to be fan art so you aren't staring at portraits of yourself all the time😂😂 but that would be so cool! A little bit of us everywhere (;
The trash cans 😂
Why was he sooo upset leaving his old place then..?Wtf Manny..haha
I like furniture but too much furniture can make your house seem crowded. I’d take some of the centerpieces on your island off just to make it seem more roomy. But I love everything else, especially the “balls” of light 😂
Dont forget to enter todays giveaway! Come on Target giftcards 😜

Hi Manny, I like both, but
I'm pretty sure most items end up in the clearance section because someone opened a new package. They could have opened it once in the clear section. I know some places just make it a sampler.

Profusion makes these lip kits, it’s a retractable lip pencil, a liquid lipstick, and a gloss. They’re super good too! The lip kit I got is like a pink rose color, it’s so pretty and the liquid lip is more of a comfortable soft matte lip 😍😍

warm toned eyeshadows for sure
I like both warm toned colors and cool toned colors. Cool tones bring out the green in my eyes. Especially taupe and purples. But I also love warm tones as well. My eyes are hazel/green and I can pull off pretty much every color except for aqua blue (it's my kryptonite color) but I can use it as long as I pair it with other colors flattering to my eye color. Oh my gosh I love nyx slide on glide on eye liners and lip pencils but that shade was way too pale lol!

Happy birthday
As a current target employee, I deal with lots of the guest service/return area. I would love for people to not test items in the makeup section because we take makeup back that has been opened, even clearance items! Buy and take it home to test please and then bring it back if it doesn’t match/work for you. I’m ready to go to our beauty section and dump everything opened 😂
Why is he look high on this video?
love your videos

SHUT UP. I've been wearing the maybeline fitme powder for a decade now, and I still use it over anything as a setting powder. Even without foundation, it is the best for getting rid of shine and muting redness. For less than $10? come on. The compartment that the applicator and mirror are in are also PERFECT for hiding small baggies of powdery substances you want to keep secret.

Target  has a clearance section but a very questionable one, lol; just a bunch of random things but I've  found a few things in those piles 👌🏾.

I think it would be a great idea if you go to another country, to pop in a supermarket like target or something like that and just buy a full face of normal makeup and full look of clearance makeup! That'd be really fun since sometimes products you have in the States you don't have them elsewhere (like in Europe)!

I cracked up when you talked about the BH airies palette and were like "I'm an airies!  My B-Day is in....  🤔 April 🙃" 😂
Manny!!!! The eyelook is so stunning. I can't even get a cut crease right 😑
Manny you have been through so much! I was a fan before you got into all that mess and I'm a fan now! Thank you so much for sticking through it and keeping your head up! Never give up💋❤
The fact that you said you dont waste anything and use the cream on the side of your fingers like us mere mortals made me so happy
YES, villains colourpop video! And YES, obsessed with Free Forms Siren😍
Klaus by far my favorite, but Diego/Number 2 is kinda bae. Am I right? Lol
Omg the moment he said: Mira que linda! I could relate so hard! Cause I always say it to myself when I put blush on 😂😂😂😂
I had so much fun watching you!  I subscribed before you even got to the foundation 😂
Nobody: 
Manny: I don’t hate the brand so please don’t stop sending me PR

Also made me laugh when he said ‘the foundation is all over the brush ... they foundation wasnt orange .. it was that deep peach colour corrector 😂
"wHy aRE thErE WhiTe sPEckS iN mY FouNDaTIoN?" I love him!😂💕

Dod the camera like die or did anyone else get a black screen once he started applying it with the beauty blender?? But love you and your channel
Umbrella academy and supernatural are the only things I watch, but I'm completely done with both of them and now have nothing to watch.
Also clause,  and five are my favorite.
The eye look reminds me of Lisa Frank
I love your personality 😂 I also can't wait for the new lunar beauty lip shades
"How are these products, really, REALLY?"
Idk Manny how is the Morphe Foundation, really, REALLY?
"You can never have enough blush."
two seconds later puts an entire crushed brick on cheeks
"God?"
I literally laugh at every joke you say and the way you make faces and the way you explain things with your hands is LITERALLY ME... I NEED TO BE YOUR BESTIE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
ILYSFM Manny!!!!  You seriously make my day everyday!!!!!!!

I looveeeee first impressions and review type of videos plus this is all stuff I've been like hmmmmmm about. That elf highlight had me kinda shook....thumbs up

Literally no one:

Manny to Manny: “Sweetheart...you’re so sweet. thanks!”
Klause will forever be my favorite! ❤️❤️
The colour corrector from Nikita works so great on you 👍🏻❤️ Flawless 😍
Klaus is my favourite!! He's just the best actor , the best character and is just the best overall 😂
Love you  - and... umbrella academy legit finished yesterday!!! Bomb!!!
Reviews online for this foundation notes: "causes cystic acne", "allergic reaction", "white balls", "marine ingredients" "texture". Its a no for me, dawg.
I watch siren toooo! Finally someone is talking about it ..!!
Umbrella academy is the BOMB 😍😍😍 like such an amazing plot line , amazing acting and great soundtrack ✨
“sweetheart, you’re so sweet. thanks” 😂😂😂
He Is literally goals like I'm here dying!!!😂😂😂😂😂💗💗💗💖💜
My favorite is 5🤗 his attitude is everything.
Thought my phone locked or broke when the blackness came on the screen at 6:22. Had to replay it back to double check lol🤣
first off LOVE KALUS!!! especially by the end of the season when he starts using his power to his full abilities I thought that was super cool! Also really enjoyed this video and always love you, Manny! thank you for constantly making me laugh and just enjoy the make up community even more with you in it!
I wish you can glam me before i leave LA😪❤️
Idk why, but the eye look, reminds me of butterfly wings! Beautiful!! Loveee it!! Amazing job!! ♡♡♡
Omg manny I’m in love with this look♥️ you look so stunning🥰😩
I love that shirt on you!!! Man of the Woods vibes.
The bloopers are probably always my favorite part of your videos 😂😂
Omg Manny!!😍😍 Umbrella Academy is literally the best I finished it the it came Out, Klaus was my absolute favorite I loved Him,what do you think about Allison and Luther being in a romantic relationship
You should watch the show Shadowhunters on Freeform. It’s so good and two of the main characters Jace and Alec are so hot. 😍
OMG KLAUS IS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER TOO FROM UMBRELLA ACADEMY😭😭
the white spots thing happens to me MANY MANY MANY times WHEN using too matte at the same time creamy/oily of a foundation or too dry for my dry skin. it. happens. just. like . that.
LOL... LOVE How you start flowing into Spanish when you get excited!
your face reactions whenever the makeup is not fixed 😂😂😂

UMBRELLA ACADEMY IS AMAZING 😭😭❤️❤️AND SO ARE YOUUUUUUU
If you like siren,
There's a series on netflix called TIDELANDERS! I thought it was good!
But I do tend to love anything involving mythical creatures😂
I love Klaus too from Umbrella Academy. My favorite power wise is Five though.
“Do I look like Rihanna yet?” 😂😂 priceless! Love you Manny.
Yes please we need your review for the villain makeup 😀😀😀😁😁💙💙💙💙💙
Manny have you ever thought of stand up comedy, you have such a gift to make me laugh so much every time, just a thought 🤷🏻‍♀️❤️
“Where’d you go though buddy.” 😂🤦🏽‍♀️
Ben, has to be my favorite character. Safe travels on your upcoming trip.
This is the most creative intense eye look you have ever done, the clouds are masterful congrats 💙💙🍒🍒

THE WHITE SPECS ON THE FOUNDATION IS GLITTER. I have the cc cream illumination and I was like what the FRICK there’s glitter on my face...but I wasn’t mad🤷‍♀️😂
LOVE how you read the comments and correct yourself 😂
Umbrella Academy is everythinggggg💙Allison is my favorite!
You should try the Iconic London Sculpt and Boost Eyebrow Cushion!!!!!!
You just have me watching shows on Netflix 🙄😤😂💖
The specks have appeared on me when I use the pro glow foundation from L’Oréal. It’s so weird! No idea where they’re coming from. 

By the way I LOVE THAT YOU WATCHED MISFITS!!!!!!!!! That was one of my favorite shows!! 

Manny, the more I watch your videos, the more happy you look. I know the incident really hurt you and I just want you to know I love you and am here to support you always 💜

Deadass finished Umbrella Academy in a day. It’s also filmed in Toronto, Canada btw
I’m sorry but that dragon beauty concealer isn’t great. Can still totally see your mustache.
Siren!!!!! Yesssss I love that freaking show but haven’t found anyone else that likes it with me 🤣
I love Klaus and Ben so so much! They were definitely my favorites and I hope that we'll see a lot more about Ben in the next season ❤️ my boss laughed so much about me because he knew that I love Klaus and everytime I came to work he asked Julia what do you think about Klaus? And I screamed probably through the whole building I love him he is the best 🤣
my favourite character from umbrella academy is Diego and someone on twitter said "someone who stan diego is just horny" 😂😂 well kinda
Klaus is my favorite from The Umbrella Academy 😊😊
Umbrella academy is just 🔥🔥😍
Gawd damn! That highlight tho!♥️💕
CLAUS IS MY FAVORITE TOO!!! I LOVE THAT SHOW! Power wise though my favorite was Diego’s.
My favorite character in Umbrella academy is #3. I love her power Lol
"I'm already doing makeup for 2 hours, make it 2 hours and 15.. Why not?" Why is that so me?! 😂😂
Always look forward to the bloopers! I love hahahaha

In love with the bloopers at the end of every video. I love everything about Manny omg
Try the foundation again after shaking and update us! My Loreal Pro Glow does that if I don't shake it first.
He is so funny. I'm new to his channel and I will definitely be staying! Love you! Will you be my best friend? Lol
I just got the it foundation and I love it! I use the new hydrating creme from benefit with it and I don't have any or barely to non oxidation and none of the white balls you were talking about but I also only use 1 to maybe 1.25 of a pump of foundation it's so full coverage this is my new 2nd skin
KLAUS!!!! and FIVE!! OMG I LOVEEEE THEM
Soy Tauro pero cumplo en Abril tmb!
Te amooo ❤
Háblame en español jajja
OMG, as a UK girl, I have been waiting so long for the Greek Goddess collection to land on Beauty Bay!!!!!!! IM SO EXCITED xxxxx

He’s my fave too! Him and Vanya ❤️❤️☂️
Manny I swear if you weren't a makeup guru you could seriously be a comedian lol you are hilarious!
Manny come on! When it comes to Umbrella Academy, Klaus was awesome but the young man who played Five was EPIC!
Omg Klaus is my fav too and me and my boyfriend always say “I heard a rumor” lmao
Manny you are a comedian!! You keep me laughing. I adore you and your videos!
I binged watched that show in the summer
Take a shot every time Manny says balls 😂🍻
Klaus is my favorite as well. I also love   Good Girls@ you need to check it out!
Klaus is my favorite too such a good character 😍
Manny: "We are here and we are queer." *Points" " Queer" 
Me: Same....
Manny I love you but this video was too long as very repetitive we heard about the dots/spots caused by the foundation like 100xs
So for the longest I was trying to figure out who you remind me of and I got it! "Shmidt" from "New Girl"!! Especially in the outtakes. I LOVE him and I love you so much bb!
OMG I love the Umbrella Academy! Klaus is my favorite. Along with the number 3. Listen to the sound track! It’s the best.
I love it cc cream and I like the confidence moisturizer so was excited about the new foundation but haven’t seen on good review.
HOW MANY TIMES IVE HEARD "JUST THE TIP"!!!!!! maybe im naive, But it gets me everytime.
Lmfao ffs.
Manny you have to check out the show The Order on Netflix!
Ask can you make a video of the colour-pop villain collection makeup please😊
I think the new Sol De Janero body glow lotions dry down and are like the fonts body lava! you should check those out for us!
Lol i love you! You always make my day.
When he said umbrella accedemy I litterally gasped 😂❤️ love you Manny!!

You make me laugh! I swear I’ve told you that about 50 times, lol.
“We’re here we’re queer” 🤗 ily manny!!! 💞💞💞
Eyyy!!!! Manny you should’ve just shown the process in fast mode instead of slipping the whole damn video ! Some want to actually see you in the process.. with no talking involved.💅🏻
I just dieeeddddd when you lifted your lash 😂😂 literally story of my life every morning im rushing to do my makeup 😂
I am only here to see his reaction on the trophy 🏆 wife body lava 😂🙏🏼

My favorite is Klaus he just so fucking amazing
Hell YASSS get on that Colourpop Villains collection boo!
When you have had way too much to drink: ‘I see white specks all over my face. It must be the foundation’.   😂
I love you Manny (and maybe the beauty lights made it look different) but that shade match wasn’t bad at all I honestly think it’s the closest I’ve ever seen on you 💞
All the Gerard Way fans were SHOOK when he mentioned Umbrella Academy 😂 ☂
Klaus is my favorite character from the umbrella academy he’s so funny
Manny: “you can never have enough blush”
applies blush
Manny: gasp ...ok um hehe it’s so much more pigmented

Klaus is def my favorite for umbrella academy. I really loved the him in the misfits too
29:45 missed opportunity to use an Austin Powers Goldmember clip, but I’ll forgive you because this look is BOMB 😍
I thought the corrector would have covered your stache since it said full coverage but it did pretty good  but could still see it.
For my 16 bday... 20 years later! 🤣 my wish will be you can be a man for one day so I can go where you at and have a hook up on you or I don't know how you say it, lmao but boy! You made me crazyyyy!

Omg thats so funny I love both umbrella academy and siren and of course stranger things.. And I really have to try that tacha cream.. Love the water silk feeling..
So.... blue blood review coming?
I fucking live for Umbrella Academy! Klaus is my absolute favorite. When I heard they were making it into a tv show I was worried how well they would handle Klaus but all my worries faded when I found out who was playing him. He is such an amazing actor and I loved him in Misfits. So glad you watched and liked Umbrella Academy 💜💜💜
What blush are you teasing us with? I noticed you said "a blush", but you did not elaborate and you don't have anything listed in the description box. Hmmmm... 🤔🤔🤔
Edit: you used two blushes... one you didn't mention, the other was the Dose of Colors one!
You’re in BeautyBay!! YAASSS 🇬🇧🇬🇧❤️❤️
You are too cute!!! Wish I knew you in person lol
hey sofi makeup






MANNY: heys of i makeup 



😂😂
Oh yea yea i loved klaus from umbrella academy
That Foundation was absolutely looking orange on you. Totally oxidized like hellllaa bad like way too pink for you I agree.
Klaus is probably my favorite. Or number 5
Omg Misfits!!!!! It was such an awesome show that I feel like noone knows about!!!
lol! at "because..I heard a rumor"
"Im confusion , im confusion".  LMFAOOOOOOOOO 😂😂
BH has sale currently with the yellow brushes and color festival collectors edition for $47. So happy that BH finally getting the attention they deserve.
Omg I love siren! One of my favorites!
Do colourpop please!!!
Umbrella Academy was great! Loved Klaus
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH OMG IVE watched you for so long ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love Siren & Umbrella Academy. Try The Order(Netflix).
Nobody:....

manny: I’m such a dad 🙄

Lmaooo 💕💕💕
Klaus is for SURE my favorite!! He’s so funny and chill but crazy too. And his powers are FUCKING SIIIICKKK!! Such a good show
Jackie Aina says use only one drop of the fenty.
Soo excited for this video!!! Love ya manny!!💕💕
I love this video! It feels like your old style a bit, not overproduced or trying too hard ❤️ although the white background is a bit glaring. But yeah!! Love it and you. ❤️
Mi Amor thank you so much for trying of different make up. It help us know the best one to try. Manny my muffin I love you to the moon and back!!
"were here and we're queer 
.... I'm queer " 
MOOD
As soon as you pulled out that BH highlighting brush, I fell in love with the color, paused this video, went to the site to buy the brush set, then came back here 😆💛💚
tbh i kinda didn’t love the way the color corrector performed on the five o‘clock shadow, but it might be just me 😮🤭
Claus is definitely my favorite 😍
You should read the umbrella academy. It's honestly wonderful, Gerard Way is a god
Yes Disney  video please!! Love you manny !!! 💕💕❤️
My birthday is April 12th, 1991 you are older then me by 8 days!
Klause is my favorite 👌🏽
I loveee klaus lmao i love the umbrella academy ive been watching it soooo much haha im almost done.. hes the best.. xo
I live for Beauty Bay 🌈🌈
I love your channel manny your plain amazing and that look was intense but beautiful.. I love the it brand as well.. I have a couple of there foundation brushes and there just not dense enough for foundation.. I use them more for powder and stick to the beauty blender for my foundation
Just wondering when will Morphe get the Greek goddess collection
😍😍😭 he’s so attractive damn
The IT foundation didn’t work for me either.
OMG I was also obsessed with Misfits! thats why I stuck through thick and thin LOL
I was really looking forward to see how u created the eye look 😭😭😭please do more in-depth eye looks
You're always so beautiful 💗💗💗
Yeeees I love the show misfits!!! Not many people know that show whenever I talk about it they have no idea lol!!
Yesss please do a tutorial on the colourpop villain collection!
You should have shown the artwork part. I want to see how you did it
I was cleaning BUUUT time to take a break 😍
I checked the EYN shadow palette and it was available the day you posted this. I was going to buy it but no $$. 3 days later, it’s sold out! Thank you Manny!!!!!! 😩
I've loved my it cosmetics bye bye foundation and bye bye redness..I was hoping you'd review it!
UMBRELLA ACADEMY IS EVERYTHING . five and allison are my favorites boo boo :)
I’m SHOOKETH!!! Your face is so my #skin GOALS!!! So I’m kind of new to your channel but I must admit that I have a lot of your products which are AWESOME!! But seriously, you are so talented! So funny! I absolutely loved you in Hawaii with #rawbeautykristi! You were so kind and caring...I saw a completely different side to you! You are the BOMB! Never change! Just be you! 🥰
Love!! Beautiful as always 💛
The white spots is probably from the Tachta creme.
I love GOLD.... gold baby!! Ur shining... dewey does not work on us oily bitches...I just love u...u bring me happiness 💕💕💋
Yassss! Please film with the new colourpop collection!
Hunny, I need you to stop fighting with the sun IMMEDIATELY 😭😭😭
LITERALLY DIED when you said you liked Siren!!!! Love that show!!
I can never see the things that manny is upset about on his face because the lighting is too bright, he just looks like a perfect porcelain doll no matter what makeup he puts on 😍
Manny, would you please try the Daisy Martinez eyeshadow pallet from BH Cosmetics PLEASE!!! There are so many beautiful colors! I would love your opinion on it! Thank you! Much Love Manny MUA!😘
When Manny says "mini balls on my face" LOL 👯
Allison!!!! But Klaus obvi. But kinda Vanya? 

Too damn good
love from Indonesia, so sad that i couldnt see you!
Woah looking real pale... like more than normal lol maybe it's the background making it more noticeable.  Love you manny!
Brand new to your channel so heyyyyy!!! Just wanted to show some love and say you are so funny, gorgeous, amazing and you definitely gained a new fan! Subscribed 👏♥️😍😘
When his eyelash popped off 😂...lmao
I think you should try doing more of a natural brow with more individual lines mimicking real hairs
I love siren it’s amazing!!
I love Umbrella Academy..i watched it over and over..i can't wait for the new season..omg/...Netfliz!!! my favorite..besides Amazon..Prime..xoxox ..giggle.
Number 5 is definitely my favorite !
I would have loved to see how you recreated this amazing eye look! Maybe you could do a voiceover next time if you feel like you can't do your makeup an talk at the same time. Love you :)
That oxidized so quick
Me and my boyfriend literally his at each other all the time because of the show siren 🤣
Umbrella Academy is SO GOOD & I feel like it’s literally for everyone
That lash moment had me shook af!! 😂😂😂
Whoa that foundation oxidizes so hard. I feel like if l'oreal can come out with the fresh wear foundation and not oxidize there's no excuse for a high end brand to oxodize that bad when a cheaper brand doesn't. 🤷‍♀️
Yes!! Disney Villain tutorial/review would be amaze!!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼 So proud of how far you’ve come Manny!! ❤️❤️
This eye look is EVERYTHING!😱
YES I WANT THE COLOR POP COLLECTION DISNEY VILLIAN REVIEW. K THANKS.
Kinda wonder what it would look like if you set the body lava with Anastasia Beverley Hills loose highlighter lol 💎
Coming from the guru that constantly stares at himself!
Coming from the guru that constantly stares at himself!

Yes Siren. Omg umbrella academy needs to come back with season 2 now
Sending love from johnson city tn
Klaus is by far my favorite!!!
I like how for once a foundation matches him and he says it doesn’t match lmao
the end omg "im a goddess" 🤣🤣🤣🤩
I agree with the blush I need a more buildable blush or it scares me away😂
I really really wish you would of sped through you doing the eye look. I feel with how intense and beautiful this eye look was too do it would have said alot seeing you do it. Talking or not a sped up clip would of been just as on point. Regardless its Amazing!
Omg love the eye look! Your face also looks so flawless !! I love it 😍😍
I wanted to see how you did the eye look 😭
Heyy hunn!! You look real nice in that shirt!!!😍
OMG I spent so much for shipping from US to UK for the Greek goddess palette because he said it might be only limited edition 😩 and now he’s saying it’s coming to BEAUTY BAY I’m so pissed 😂😂😂😂🙆‍♀️❤️❤️
Klause was def favorit character from umbrella academy... maybe because I used to be a drug addict so I totally related to him. Especially when he was dope sick. He portrayed it so well. Is that a weird thing to comment?
Oh n five was the shit too.
Dude I can literally watch you all day!!! You have me dying every video🤣🤣 you’re a party in yourself and so real I love it ❤️ come to Vegas soon please!!!! This mami 🇲🇽 loves her some manny! 👑 Definitely do a colorpop video or a worst rated place video! Can’t wait to see what’s to come💖

THE BLOOPERS ARE WHAT I LIVE FOR 😂😂😫
I was so gagged when You said You’re doing new Colorpop Villain collection. I got so excited when I saw it on IG but I didn’t know if someone would review it. Please, do the review 💖💖💖
I need those BH Cosmetics brushes! I love that bright color and their brushes are so freakin good and so inexpensive! 💕
Oh I gotta get those ABH Loose Highlighters! So pretty! 💖
we love the same shows??!! BEST FRIENDS??? I THINK SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOMGGG !!!!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU IN JAKARTA SOON !!! LOVE TO SEE YOU, MANNY !!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 you are hilarious, love the video 👌👍
you did a eyelook that was stunning and was the colors of the shirt you’re wearing in this video! plz plz plz do that eyelook on camera! maybe could use underrated eyeshadow palettes or something. i don’t think bh cosmetics gets the hype it deserves! i just got two of their palettes and they’re bomb 🔥💦 loved this video and i can see lushous has been running off on you, love him! sending much love from houston!
So I see a package from morphe came in. And I was like weirrrrd. Didn’t order nothing. Saw my mom ordered, and asked what she got. Manny “MooA” said this was the best highlighter brush. She pulled it out and I have the same one lmaoooo.
number 5 is my favourite. soooo cuteeee
Number 5 is definitely my favorite, not only is his character so interesting to watch , he just gives the show that wow factor, and he is also so cute ;)))
Klaus and Vanya are amazing and they have amazing powers #umbrellaacademy
the little noises he makes like at 17:09 are so cute. 💛
Today I tried the It cosmetics illuminating foundation and I saw those little white specks/glitter on my face toooo!
Klaus is my favoriteeee, he’s honestly kind of daddy😬😍
Same, Claus is my favorite and rumor is my favorite power
Dude! Siren is so good!! I literally be thinking when I play it “I. Am. Ryn.”
💟💟💟 Your videos make me smile! You did a fabulous job with the eye look. I've seen in comments about the It Cosmetics new foundation is that it doesn't work with primers (??) I love the CC cream but am hesitant to go for this one.
The Milani foundation gives me white spots :(
I like that foundation. Less is more. It wears well for me.
Klouss** favorite! And ...I heard a rumor...that Manny mua did my makeup *Manny pops up in my passenger seat* 😍😍😍
Mad 💚 Manny
Haha.. Yaasss! I love Umbrella Academy!! 1 episode later~I binge watched the 1st season within 2days! 2Damn days girl! I did! Hahahaa..aww. That's not all. Lol. I've rewatched all of them but 1 now!

all that blush makes him kinda look like a clown 😂😂
LOVING THIS LOOK!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
UMBRELLA ACADEMY IS HANDS DOWN THE ABSOLUTE BEST TF
With bright pallets like this, here in the UK we have the ‘plouise base’ which is AMAZING for bright shadows, so that may work better with that pallet
Let’s see how the balls look on my face once it sets!😂😂😂 Love it! 🌙😘
in love with BeautyBay🥰🥰
Wow you look sickening the house in this video 😍😍😍✨
honestly all bh cosmetics shades look alike.
I think your   So pose to shake the bottle before use
I miss his old background 😔💕💕💕 but your still poppin 🥴🤠!!
I love how he says can feel that to not being able to afford certain makeup but we all know that’s a lie
Love the eyes😍😍 and the flannel😍staying up way too late, it’s literally 2am in Norway 🇳🇴 😂 lots of ❤️
You missed a “gold member” reference at the end lol
I looove Klaus! & Five!
“Can’t waste it.” I felt that in my soul.
Manny I'm Shannan and I love you and mermaids and I'm 8.
Love siren, love umbrella academy.  Has anyone watched Love, Death and Robots?
You’re just hilarious 🤣 love it
The OA is really good too...
UMBRELLA ACADEMY!! I watch it when I attempt to work out! LOVE IT!
I LOVE SIREN! I was literally screaming at the TV for Ren not to trust that girl. Ugggg.
Tell me why you are channeling Bretman Rock in this! Bahaha BITCH
I love it!
Also love Claus in UA
Haven’t watched Sirens yet
You need to watch The Order
It’s great too!
What is “nude” lippie to YOU is NOT “nude” to others with with darker skin 🙃😉
I have those same white spots in my covergirl true matte foundation.  ☹
@ 28:31 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Omg I want to meet you at Beauty Fest Asia😭
Omg plz do a colourpop video pleeeease🤗
Thank you, that is all ❤️
Manny you have to watch OA on Netflix... it's so good season 2 just came out and I died. I binnnnged.
I’m literally obsessed with this eye look. You nailed it🥰
Alsooo you should check out 'The Order' on Netflix
Can you make a video trying the color changing foundation? It like starts off white and blends to match your skin tone. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
YES TO COLOURPOP VIDEO
Yasss. Klaus is daddy 😍
OMG GIRL I LOVE UMBRELLA ACADEMY SO F ING MUCH
I have been using "No Poreblem" for over a year and I thought I was the only one who liked it! It works really well and the price is great!
Ladies set your color corrector and primer with powder before tapping on foundation
His face is literally the cutest heart shape ever😍love you Manny
What did you use for that bright blue liner?
I love you manny 💕 love your videos
I swear to god sometimes I think he has multiple personalities 😂 he just goes from one mood to another 😭 LOVEHIM ❤️
"What did this to me?" Lmao
This is the first video I watch of you but I have to say you are one of the first male make up artists I see that does not have those crazily plumped, out of proportion lips! Thanks for not following this trend or thinking you can only be beautiful with big voluminous lips.
Is the brightening powder anything special?
You should do a makeup tutorial, where Christine, Simply Nailogical does your makeup? It'll be hilarious! And awesome.
omgggg i loveee this one sm. idk if its the weed or if its you. but i love itttt (((;
I appreciate you too Manny! Love ya ❤️
As soon as he used the color corrector on his mustache I was like "hello Freddie Mercury"
KLAUS US MY BABY OH EM GEE
would love to see your film set up, desk, lighting, mirror etc you know what I mean?! so curious!!
Ive had the white balls happen to me with other foundations! I found out it was actually my beauty blender! Just needed cleaned
We got the horses in the back 😂 YEE HAW🤠
I WISH WE COULDVE SEEN HOW YOU DID THE EYES 😩 THEY CAME OUT S T U N N I N G! 😍😍😍
Omg Allison was my favorite too!! “I heard a rumor” 🗣 and Vanya! Just at the end when she’s in all white playing her violin with so much power! S H O O K. I love you manny 💖
So you could probably set the liquid trophy wife with a light dusting of the trophy wife pressed powder highlight. Idk if people do that or if it’s a thing. But expect a super glow haha. 


Love the bloopers at the end. 

Side note. I love you to death and I’ve said this before and ik the laugh is like your thing but it’s kinda awkward now and seems so forced. I feel like you do it bc it was your thing. No one would be mad if you didn’t do it.
Umbrella academy is life season 2 needs to happen right now!
I can't talk and do make up at the same time, literally my job on YouTube.
LOL I freaking love your videos!
Do a Villains look from Colour Pop!
Iv just started siren I’m on episode 6 oh my god can we appreciate how gorg ryn is like ... aghhhhh
OMG MANNY WE BOTH ARE ARIES!? Aries represent your date.
Mines April 15th❤🎂
SHOW ME THE VILLIANS
Aries ♈️ all the way Manny!!! April 4th baby!!!
Manny makes me laugh SO much. 😍😍😍🤗
I love manny, but I’m a little suspicious as to whether he finished that eye look himself 🤔
I love you manny hope you see this you make my bad days great, and my great days amazing your my source of happiness ✌🏼🥰😘
Foundation matches manny perfectly
Manny why do you always pick your nose
 👃👈🏻
Omg  I really appreciate you!! Hahahaha
I’ve been watching Siren since the night it aired, and I LIVE!!!
I was so shook with the 3some in Siren !!! 😳
the white specs happened to me when i tried a clinique foundation!!!!!
"Hijo de tu madre pinchi glow" jajajaj te amo <3
You are sassy and adorable, I've never watched you til now and you made me giggle so much.
Yayyy new upload!! I’ve stuck by you since day. 1!!! ❤️❤️❤️
YES DO THE COLOUR POP VIDEO ❤️
Manny why is there a black screen for a solid 3 seconds. I am confusion
Not gunna lie I fell asleep through half of it so I had to watch it again 😂♥️ Love you Manny!! 



(If anyone sees this I would love if you checked out my channel 💙)
Absolutely love love loovvveeeee umbrella academy!!!! Klaus defs my faavvvv I mean have you seen him 😍
I love the color of the minnie blush and maybe it would have been better with a lighter hand and on its own.  And I like the Nikita powder, it visibly brightened .
watching the color change of the foundation oxidizing lol yeahhh that foundation is a NO for me.
Manny! You’re not allowing me watch this to the end cause I’m now going to check out Umbrella Academy 😄
Because I thought that it was hilarious when she did makeup on BEYENN
Umbrella academy: I LOVE NUMBER 5 HES SO FRICKING HOT 🥵 and talented ofc ☺️☺️
Samee 🌂 Academy is dopee sad it ended thoo
Manny trying to be relatable for 33 minutes
I work at Ulta & every time I color match someone to this foundation I always get those white specs. I thought it was my brushes or something lol 😫😫😫
I loved misfits haha #memories x
That eyelook is so cool!! Well done
The white specks are clumps of powder in the foundation probably !?
you should wear a chain!! it would look dope cuz u always wear ur shirts a lil more open ! 🥰
Bought the Life’s A Drag palette yesterday sooooo excited!!!! 😌😌
Please do the separate video of the Disney Villain Collection!❤❤❤
When I use L'Oréal foundation with a beauty blender the same thing happens. I think it must be the primer we are using?
The sand like texture happened to me as well when I tried the Confidence in a Foundation. It wad also very yellow on me. Returned it.
Please review daisy marquez x BH Cosmetics
Omg when he said , good stuff at 16:33 he sounds likkeeeeeee emma chamberlain , allott
Did you just skip the entire application of eye shadow?! Maybe film it and do a voice over next time l'm so sad I didn't get to see the application because it looks amazing
“Oh my gaRR?, hijo de tu madre, pinchi glow” i just loved that
you have Libra energy
I've used that foundation 5x now and I've not personally had that problem
The screen went black 6:22 🤔
My birthday is in April too ❤❤
The "lil balls are still there" lmao
I love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Manny SLAYED this eye look. Versatile queen!
Beautiful look! Awesome products too! Thanks for the new video!
Maybe try shaking up the foundation so it’s all mixed 🤷🏽‍♀️
I freaking love Klaus
Am I the only one that thought that Manny was Related to DR. Mike
Ran across you on IG about 6 months ago & just found out about the YouTube vids!! I absolutely love watching & listening to you. Keep doing you 😍 .. and showing us!!
PLEASE REVIEW HONEST BEAUTY MAKEUP!! They started selling diapers and somehow ended up making skincare and makeup. I would love to see if it’s worth it 😊❤️❤️
i love siren and umbrella academy i watch them all the time
That eye look is STUNNING
Klaus is definitely my favorite
Okay I've never really watched manny but I saw this and watched it and holy shit. Why do I relate to him so much? Seems such a nice guy!!

And holyyyy umbrella academy is amazing.
Okay sis but when you said something about umbrella academy I freaked out lol
I fuckin love siren!! Best show ever!!!
Please do a Disney makeup collection!
Playing with new make up while watching manny,  bessst ✌🏼✌🏼
Pinche glow!!, i know hu?

Umbrella Academy YAAAS ☂️
I LOOVVEEE Klaus!!!!! I live for his powers and I think he's hot!! I loved The ☂️ Academy! Great show!
"I am so shookie wookied"
Manny! I’m so glad all that “drama” died down, truly ridiculous! Love you man!
My birthday is in April too ❤
Babyy this eyelook is sooo bomb!!!!
I love Siren. Such a good show.
You did awesome with that friggin eye look!!
Those white specs happen to me with certain foundations such as the L’Oréal pro glow and the covergirl matte foundation, I think it’s just that those foundations to do not react well with my skin. 🤷🏼‍♀️
No blue blood pallet from PR???
Work It Sister! 😍
Villain collection please 🤪
Cuttest 😍😂😂
Wore my Life’s a drag pallet this weekend.  I got so many compliments someone even said it was their favorite look they ever saw me do. 💕💕
There's no way he's an Aries! 😅
My husband and I are 100% here for Umbrella Academy.  I’m a HUGE fan of Klaus!
Omg tb to child hood . Your eye looks is giving me vibes of Lisa Frank / cheetah
Pro tip..set your color corrector so it doesn't blend into your foundation
I love umbrella academy! They have to come out with season 2!!
When you say you’re a Goddess I died 😂
I’m SOOOOO excited that ABH made so Hollywood a loose highlight, that’s literally the first highlight I ever used and fell in love with I can only imagine how amazing the loose version will be
Could u make a vid of other things one can use that makes it where you DONT need to use primer??? For ex: i used my Kiehls nighttime oil & didn’t use primer & it worked beautifully:):)
"Hijo de tu madre! Pinche glow!" Hahahahahaha!  That's gonna be my favorite phrase  from this moment on and gonna scream it everytime i find a good highlighter.
Yes do a villains video!!
That highlight thoooo😍🔥
What’s with the long pause Manny? 😂😂
Guess Hey!!! Am ßubbing too every1 the likes and ßubbbss to meee 🔥❤️
Please come to Kuala Lumpur!!!
The shirt you’re wearing in the monkey video is 😍😍😍😍 on you!! Love you 💕
5:04 trying to have a teaching moment but i can’t take him serious with all the color corrector on his face 😂😂 haha love you manny
MANNY DO MORE CREATIVE EYE LOOKS LIKE THIS!!!
Please do a first impressions of the new lip products by Dominique cosmetics 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Background music is driving me nuts! Please don't use this again.✌
Manny and manny fans...what is your favorite primer that is also moisturizing  and not to heavy? I've been using Primerizer (primer + moisturizer). I love it but wondering if theres a newer or better one to try?!
Wait, how come I can still notice his mustache area after he applied foundation over the color corrector?
I just love love love your videos!!! ❤️
manny love you boo boo but... something's things up with the music. I keep hearing a really high pitched alarm sounding beeping or tone... something is happening and I'm having a hard time paying attention to my queen. ❤
can we talk about how GOOOD his skin looks tho
10:42 omg I cant 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love klaus and Diego and five and  Leonard yeah 😂😂
Yes umbrella society I live!!!!
You seem very happy and calm in this video!!!!❤️
I looooved the misfits
“Hijo de tu madre, pinche glow” favorite part! 😂👏🏼
3:45 why manny look like that one episode with spongebob and Patrick when they put the seaweed on looking like men lmaooo
Mustache definitely still looks blue lol
I love your personality, your vids always make me smile and laugh......thank you for that!
Yesssss OMG😍😍🔥💙
10:40 girlll....
I am a Aries to April 14
Did anyone think their phone froze, ad was gonna play, or Momo was coming to get them at 6:22 because I was S H O O K...
Who else loves Manny Mua ?🌙 🙋🏻‍♀️
I like when you talk in Spanish 😂
I'm waiting for the day that I'm so focused on something, like looking for those little specks, and a crazy flash of a scary lady or something pops up-like those old school maze challenges!! 🤣🤣 Anybody else with me?!?!
♈️♈️♈️ should have known you were an Aries lol. It’s our season!!!
Color corrector looks like Manny ate a bag of Cheetos.
I love the it Cosmetics foundation. I didn’t have any specks in mine.
Vanya/ White Violin is my fave from Umbrella Academy. But I have a thing for bad guys/ morally corrupt individuals. I will eventually do a cosplay of her, just because it makes my little goth heart sing. <3
Yaasss please do a review on the colourpop villains! I’d love to see what you come up with!!!!!❤️
I LOVE Vanya! 👏🏽
I keep forgetting it is still very much winter over there, but you are so white. Need some vitamin D!!
Am  I hearing things or is there beeping in the background? I kept taking my headphones off because I got annoyed and also tried to see if the beeping was on my end.
every mua always does a sped up montage of their eyeshadow or at least shows one eye. idk that was kinda weird...
Omg umbrella academy is soooo good! I binge watched it in 2 days haha
I love Klaus!!
Is it just me or did the foundation match him just perfectly?🤩
Keeping it 100 I was not sub'ed or following through the thick and the thin. BUT when I saw RawBeautyKristi had you in her travel blog, and she is friends.... I'm back in. I love her and respect her opinion. If she can trust you I am giving you another chance. Please be a good friend. I do appreciate your owning you needed to change.
OML did u finish the whole season???? Because hunttyyyyy ohmygod umbrella academy got me shookkkkk
You're always so entertaining.  I would've preferred to see the actual eye application, even if it was sped up and no talking.  Love ya Manny!  xo
Idk if I’m crazy, but that color corrector didn’t seem to do anything for your mustache 🤔
Manny gets cuter by the video
Umbrella Academy was awesome!
I AM SO SHOOKIE WOOKIE
Do a full face video of the Disney Villians colourpop !!!😭💜
I’m down for the villain video ☺️ I loved umbrella academy ❤️
Thank you so much for making this! Super informative! 

... also Umbrella Academy was amazzziinnngggg 😭
10:39 OMG I’m dead 😂😂
i’m so proud of u manny for not wearing a black shirt this time
Best part of Manny videos are the outtakes!
YOU COMING TO INDONESIA OMG WHAT!? YESSSSSSSSS
Hahaha I will say it again I love your personally!!!!! 10.41 was to funny 😂😂😂
for sure Klaus
But power wise vanya
I love the umbrella academy, I do not like how they treated Vauna, they are the reason she caused the apocalypse. However, I like how they didn’t leave her and took them with her at the end of the show. I love Klaus’s character he’s the funniest of the show and I’m deeply sorry for his lost love. But I have to say Allison is my favorite because I love her power the most or I heard a rumor. I wouldn’t stop saying those lines after I finally saw the full extent of her power. Luther and Allison are not a cute couple, I rather have them as siblings and see Allison with her ex husband and with her daughter in the future.
KLAUS! Even though he was annoying at first, but definitely best character IMO
You did that boo 😘😘
Klaus is my spirit animal.
That brush looks like the Fenty brush🤔
Yasssss ! Aries ♈️ gang 🤟
"Mmm sweetheart, you're so sweet"
"Thanks" 
😂😂 You crack me up!
Guys...I need good hydrating foundation, concealer, and powder options...my skin was really oily and turned SUPER dry like overnight. :(((((
Omggggggggg. Sammmeeeee. April GAANNNGGG 🙌🏽😝
from the umbrella academy five is my favorite ydfhkvbfydfjhk i love aidan sm
I just got water for my spicy ramen noodles and I already ran out. Now I need to get back up and pause the video and get more water
You put Colourpop in the title but didn't use anything from that brand?
I love this look on you Manny good job
I legit been here since the thick and thin huntyyyyy just created a new YouTube with the perspective of uploading. Thanks for inspiring me, that no matter how many times people wish your down fall. You dust off and pick yourself back up. 🌻
LOL @ "Im a Dad, literally, Im a father...."
Love this
Aww, I love Ryn, Maddie, and Ben! ❤ I kinda want to be mesmerized by the siren song! 😂
The Covergirl Matte Made foundation leaves behind white specs too.
Whenever I watch your videos, I keep thinking your background music is "Burnin up" by The Jonas Brothers aha.
Ive been a loyal since day 1 as in 1st video love you
UMBRELLA ACADEMY!!!!!
I’ll add a new “🥰” for every like

🥰
can we have tips on doing a cut crease and a floating cut crease??
Yes do the colorpop video💖
The foundation oxidised omg
Thrift thick reviewed that foundation and I noticed the white specks on her too but I don't think she noticed!!
OMG WHEN YOU FINISHED THE EYE LOOK I WAS SHOOK !!!!!!!!!!  WOOOOOOOWWWWW
Yessss do the color pop collection plzz♥️♥️♥️
I prefer the brightness when you bring it down slightly!
You are the first person Ive seen use an orange or red concealer, thanks
Do we want a Colourpop Disney Villains review??? Umm Yes Please!!!
Manny not to be rude at all or in any way because I love you but the palette is 26 dollars as of yesterday
If you can make “eress what eress” merch that would be great 😂 That’s pretty much my life motto, it is what it is but how you say it lmfao! 🙌🏼
number five is def my fav
In the Umbrella Academy, Ben is probs my favorite.
I think you will like step up high water there 2 season and there on YouTube
I heard a rumour!! You are coming to London to visit me and we are getting married at some point in life! 😋😍😘
Welcome to my CHANEL and next time it's Welcome go my Gucci
Umbrella Academy YASSS!!!
Can you do a full face of hard candy?
17:09 is all of us complimenting ourselves in a nutshell
Just the tip... right there... mmm

😳 is it makeup? Is it porn? Is there really a diff? 😂
I am an Aries too! April 18th here!
Easy on the blush biiiitch
Why do you do that?! 😣 you could have sped it up without sound or some background music while you did the eyes. 🤷😒
Wish you had left the camera on while you did the eyeshadow look. You didn't have to talk. 
I feel like you always go off camera when you do really artistic looks.
I tried color matching one of my customers to the new IT foundation and we could not find one I tried multiple on her and they were all soooo pink it was so bad 😩
Ugh, remember why I left.....
Omg please do a video with the new colourpop disney villains collection!!
Misfits though!!!!
Love the giggle!!!
Yea hell no to that foundation you were turning into larry the lobster
His blush tho😬
“ wow I’m dewy. “ 😂😂😂 I love you Manny! ❤️
Living for ur videos love them all
It’s actually looks like a planet or saturn on ur eyes beautiful
I feel like every time Manny has any lip product on, even if it's a clear gloss, he talks like hes scared to let his lips touch his teeth...😂😂😂😂 anyone else notice that?+
I have that foundation and love it. Mine didn’t cause spots. Weird.
Do a cut crease tutorial please
When the black screen appered i thoungh it was my pc or net xD
I really would’ve liked to see Manny do the full eye look🙃
Clause is my favorite too.
I hate you but I love you. Strange 🤔🤔🤔 right!!!!
That foundation was  literally getting darker by the second at first lol started out so light and then bam just no lol however the color corrector really does look great!
I was so excited for that foundation but so many people have been saying that it’s gritty and leaving sand-like particles all over their skin.
Whwn in april? Im the 6th
Omg I loved the makeup look!!!! You’re so amazing!!!
I loved this video!!!! Also as a side note, I personally feel like the foundation shade really brings some life to you. That being said, you always look great, I’m jelly 😭❤️
That eyelook😍
daisy marquez palette us .. PLEASE !
Honestly didn't cross my mind that Manny had chest hair. I think I just naturally thought he didn't have any
APRIL BABIES 🤙🏽
The it cosmetics has color correctors built into it. I bet the red one u used An the foundation together didn’t work together.. all the it cosmetics have color correction in them..
I’m starting to get a little frustrated that so many things are done off camera. It’s not just manny. But like, for example - beautiful look, BUT I DONT UNDERSTAND THE CUT CREASE. Plz just do it on camera, same for liner. I’m out here just trying to see how you do it 😭
The Loreal pro glow foundation gives me those little white dots on my face if I dont spend enough time blending it in!!
29:43 am I the only one who doesn’t see anything
I love Siren! Lol 🤣🐒
Omggg I love siren 😍😍😍
Misfits 😍😍
Kinda upset we didn’t get to watch you do the eye look. 😕
24:51 priceless lol . you can always count on manny to make you laugh
Why are you so adorable?!? Can't even or odd!!
I really wished he did a voice over so we can at least see how he did the eye look. Side note hell yea we want that colourpop tutorial
I love your Spanglish
I am so relieved I’m not the only one that had the white ball/specks all over my face when I tried this!!!
SIREN IS SO GOODDD
Ya Allah astagfirullah banyak²lah tobat oy katek antanan nian kau nih eh
Yes to villains!
We love Rihanna but girl we're not paying that much for a body highlight, in the summer time my favourite thing is part body oil, part water, I can't remember but I might have put some vinegar in it to keep it longer, also maybe some Aloe Vera, some perfume to make it smell fruity, and a mix of all my favourite highlighters!! It's really pretty going to the beach and idk sis it stays on really well and dries on too, even with the oil 🤷 AND overtop of sunscreen because we don't want skin cancer not today honey
COLORPOP VILAIN YEEEEEES
Yesssss colorpop villains
even antonio get the color pop collection...gurl
Babe you ARE an icon 9:32
sis stop doing the same looks all 2019
Damn I wish I saw the eye look on camera
U should work at the makeup Solon
Manny we can’t see it 😂😂
Misfits was AMAZING
"Hijo de tu madre, pinchi glooooow"  gaaaag! It is what it is!
okay i love you but why does your insta pop up remind me of the disney channel pop up lmao
Manny is big mama now.
I love the umbrella academy too it is the bomb
I agree with your blush opinion...my cheeks are already natually a little pink..dont need super pigmented blush..i like the builders too. :) 👍👍
Do the Disney collection in a video please 🙏🏽
I really wish you would have time lapsed yourself doing the eyes even if we didn't hear you 😢
i honestly don’t think it’s the foundation manny that was giving you the white specks. everytime i use the no poreblem primer with a full coverage foundation it like pills up and creates those specks. i totally understand that experience. the primer just doesn’t agree w that foundation ! pls try it again without the primer
Shookey wookied lol
Pinchi glow JAJAJA
~has nightmares about the little balls~
You remind me so much of my 15 year old son...igualitos!
The cover girl matte made foundation did this to me too. The white spec thing. It was a shame because the formula was great.
MANNY YOU NEED TO DO A COLLABORATION WITH ANTONIO GARZA !!!!!!!!
I love you! U funny as hell in my worst days you brighten me up don’t stop doing u ur amazing can’t wait to see new opportunities for u, you are going to be big...sending lots of love all the way from Lubbock Texas 💋❤️💋❤️
Que sexy 😍😍❤️❤️
Please pleeease review the color pop villain collection!
Umbrella academy is bombbbbb! Just like u lol
Better late than never!!
His foundation was oxidizing THE HOUSE
Love you bunches ❤️
This Chanel is sadly dying...
...I don’t see anything on the fenty 👀
Say white specs more ....😂
The only time Manny doesn't want white specks on his face
The gigle i cant get over it lol
Shout out to my ride or die, lol. Yes girl. We live for you. Ok so Netflix has me hooked on all the supernatural. Siempre Bruja - get into it. And The Order! It's True blood meets my babysitter is a vampire. At college. Now go!
Hello Fellow Aries, It sucks for me everything for Aries is fire and warm and I'm a pale ass cool tone.  LOL
I Iove the video Manny!
I hate that I literally bought those BH brushes bc of this video 😩
The house — Rich Lux
Can u do the princess and the vilan collection
Claus and Alice
Why did it black out?😊
the ''hijo de tu madre pinche glow" got me laughing for like 20 mins hahahhaha
Yessss colourpop
Uhhmmmm manny,,,I love youuuu!!
When he was talking about the whit specs he sound like an old crazy person. I was rewinding that just to laugh.... I 😂😂😂
right on the chichis 😂😂
should have just sped up thru the eyeshadow part! we still would have liked to see :)
The actor from the umbrella academy Cameron Brodeur goes to my high school lol
Siren is SO GOOD
sometimes if you don't shake up your foundation it can leave white specks.
Wish you showed how you did the eye look!  Def do the villain collection
You need to stop saying the b and f world
Cover girl matte made foundation does that too, when I reached out to cover girl they said it was particles of silica (I think) that are there to absorb the oil throughout the day. I usually flick them off with a fluffy brush since I love the oil control that stuff gives me
I wish I could do brows like that
You’re in indonesia??? Omg! Konnichiwa!
Okay.... I follow her.....it’s “hey...Sofi...Makeup” lol just thought I’d share 😂🤷🏻‍♀️ Just an accident tho.
I live for the bloopers
Klaus! Also you should check out The Magicians, since you like Umbrella and Sirens. Seasons 1 - 3 are on Netflix.
K DON'T even get me started on Umbrella Academy! I literally watched the whole season in a day and a half! OMG I LOVE IT SO MUCH! Klaus is probably my fav character for a few reasons, 1 he is just funny af, but the fact that his power is being a medium was sooo sweet! I kept wondering why they never said how Ben died tho...?? Anywayz, you Rock Manny! Sooo talented, even when u have white balls on your face! Haha 😈
Lord he irritates me
Manny u r so cute n super sexy 😳😳😳
YES FOR DISNEY COLORPOP
Love this look 😍
I want to see the villain collection
Loooove the eyes 😻
'Little balls" LMAO
Are you and Laura lee still friends since morphe dropped her?
I don’t think any of your vids have made me laugh harder than this one did
6:24 what happened 😕
Was anyone else so shook by his eye look that you fell over?
Watch love/hate Irish show his in it’s amazing think it’s on Netflix
BITCHHHHHHHPLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ DISNEY VILLAN REVIEW workkkkkkk
I THOGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WATCHING SIREN!!!!!!
If you like Sirens you'll love Tidelands on Netflix.
Manny is my happy place! Can we be best friends?! For reals tho....💁💜
LOVE YOU MANNY 😊💖
That foundation oxidized to my shade! Hello??
YASSSSSS TO THE DISNEY VILLIANS COLLECTIONNNNNN!!!
The L’Oréal Infalliable Pro-Glow foundation left those white dots on me too! I had no idea what was going on because that had never happened before.
Manny is my baby ♥️
“yo i don’t waste NOTHING” 🤣 this is me with every expensive skin care product i own
No one on YouTube can get and keep my attention like Manny. I love watching cause u keep me laughing.
Definitely claus
Ok so i’m not crazy!! The same thing happened to me when i tried the foundation!! there was white specks all over my face!!😭 they were like little balls of white pigment!
reminds me of lisa frank
Wow that foundation oxidized so bad
Umbrella academy has been my show lately lol
bloopers are the best :D
What blush did you use??
rawkristibeauty said the colorpop blush look really dark but dont go on that way and are buildable...please try them!!! she loves!
Love you to chulo 🌹🙏
MisFits was awesome and Umbrella school has totally made it’s way up there with Iron fist and Defenders as expected though lol 😝 anticipating the season
hey looks so gre (a) y
I don’t know about y’all but I can’t sit through a manny video without laughing the WHOLE time!!!! I absolutely love him!!!
I think he should shave his beard
Glad you feeling better
You need to stop playing with your nose... if you know what I mean 🤫
I’m dying at the foundation white specks 😂😂
You’re a makeup artist! Why didn’t u show us your blending techniques ok the eye??? Totally skimmed past it! 😩😩😩 my fav part! I have the most trouble with that
Can US by the palette or is it just UK
IT made a note saying that the foundation oxidizes..
You're welcome fam
There are a whole bunch of clean at Sephora makeup brands like lawless, rms, ilia and so much more it would cool if you did some reviews on some of these brands???
Major miss:
Manny mua
villains collection video. yes.
Balls on the face can be so fun though! But when it comes to makeup balls... just no! LOL
Nice eye game Manny ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
I LOVE KLAUS
The confidence in a foundation has sea salt in the ingredients, that’s probably the white specks ur seeing
He went off camera so someone else can do this for him
the it cosmetics cc cream does the same thing to me! it’s like super fine glitter specks & it looks like i put a powder highlighter all over my face
Dying for the Disney colour pop!!!!
I loveeee klaus
Love the look but I wish u zoomed up on the eyeshadow look and the fenty glow cause I couldn’t see the glow on ur neck at all and I would’ve love to see the eyeshadow much closer 💓
I love Five and Klaus
i like the calm manny better lol
Manny you should’ve just recorded doing the eye look and sped it up so we could kind of seen your process. We don’t need you to always explain it.
33 minutes later and I still can't see the white specs.
Klaus is my ultimate fave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish u could do my makeup
I have large pores.. (Thanks dad).. Lol .. Amd oily t-zone ..but i am 52 yrs young now ..what primer would you recommend..
FYI he used to color corrector And you could still see through it
I seriously love for those brushes. They should make them in all of the neon colors. How fun
*sees no white specks
Colour pop Disney villian video please
What was the black screen around 6:25 time stamp for?
I need those neon brushes. Obsessed
Manny, my skin care routine is 90% tatcha. The dewy skin cream is meant for dry skin and of I'm not mistaken you're oily, right? They make the water cream for normal/oily skin!
Maybe it looks different irl, but on the video that foundation is pretty much a perfect match.
16:46-16:55 had me crying
SAVE ME BARRY
He’s funny asf
My mom has this foundation. There's little glitter specks in it. I switched it before
Ok I know this makes me sound rude and big headed because you ARE better at makeup than me, but if you happen to see this you should try getting a clean big big fluffy face brush to blend and buff your blush in better. It will look a lot more pretty and natural.
I LOVE UMBRELLA ACADEMY!!!!!!!
Love Siren.
Sister you look sooo pale
Te quiero mucho Manny 💘
I love you Manny!
I wonder if those white dots in the foundation are like the same stuff that is in the too faced peaches Mattifying setting spray. That disappears when you shake it up?
I loveeeeeeeee umbrella academy 😍😍😍😍😍😍
is it just me or is everyone elses screen super blue tinted i checked other videos its only this one
Wtf is wrong with your speech dude
Who else had a black screen ?
Their radiant CC cream also contains glitter in it!! That’s what their illumating factor is 🙃
Is it true that you were evicted from your home and now are sleeping in a homeless shelter 😞😞
"you guys, i do NOT know what the fuck is going on..." HAHAHAHA i died and then came back to life for the "why is there white specks in my foundation?!" part LMAO! You're the actual best.
Not the wonky eyelash!!  Lol!!!
It's not a mustache  It's a' mousn't touch'.
Yeees! Klaus is the best!
So I'm catching up on all my manny videos and i think you should reveiw KENIA ONTIVEROS make up line or like CHIKIS RIVERA make up line
So I litter-aly watched your warning of the black screen on Instagram before watching this, and when it happened I was still like wtf?! Lol then I remembered.... I would like the color pop video as well!!!
Did anyone else get a black screen for a few seconds?? Or is that just me??
ok am i the only one who heard "butthole" when he said the lip gloss shade name? lmao i had to listen to it like 4 times
Siren is my shitttt
I love klaus to omg
8:42 😂😂😂😂😂
Yes!! Colourpop Disney Villains!!! Please review.
you’re so funny and comfortable like i wanna be your friend so bad
Manny what skin type are you? cause I’m oily and if you are too I’d like to see what products you use and what tricks you have to reduce oiliness when doing makeup. please let me know 😭
Number 5 by far!
Team Klaus, baby!!
You are hilarious
Make up your miiinnnd with the foundation
I get that in the it cosmetics cc cream
Anyone else going to Beautycon nyc
i would absolutely love for you to do a full video on the disney villain colour pop collection. my mom and i always called my grandma the evil queen so i’m really looking forward to this collection
20$ uk dollars on beauty bay comes out to like 30$ US dollars
Omg I can’t believe we have the same birthday month
maybe the tatcha moisturiser made the foundation ball up because it’s like a dewy one, idk sometimes that happens to me when i just put moisturiser on with no foundation so maybe it could be that they’re both quite dewy idk just a thought but might be wrong xox
I was going to comment and tell u to review the Disney villain collection if u didnt mention it and it's the 1st thing u mentioned .yesss we want to see it !
Hay tann linda 🤣 love you bb ❤💋
I work at ulta and bought it when it came out. I’m the lightest shade. I’ve never been able to use an iT foundation because I’m so fair but I love it. It’s $30 cheaper than my YSL All Hours and it gives me the same effect and doesn’t oxidize on me.
I love klaus and 5 😍😍😍😍
It's because the foundation has a moisturizer and sunscreen in it. It's literal cream on your face.
You’re one of my favourite people. I love you!! You should send me some makeup you don’t use and don’t want.
Maybe the foundation needs to be shook in the glass bottle more then regular foundation?!
Klaus and #5
Omg a Monkey grabbed your earring that was hilarious you kill me Manny only you 💁🏻👍🏼😆😂✌🏼️👊🏼 lmao.
You can’t waste a drop babe! It’s like 5 bucks!
Yes disney color pop
ummmm where are those pale yellow handled brushes from????
Wow this ancient curse is still on YouTube 🙄 Get out of my recommended!
11:01 casually picks nose
I’ve seen umbrella academy and i literally live for it❤️began to cry when vanya killed addison tho😭but i love it💋😂 (sorry for bad english, not english:))
ilyysmmmmmmm ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾ALWAYS
diego is the only option
love your videos
The Covergirl Trublend Matte Made foundation does the white pigment speck thing.
“I’ve never had balls on my face before” intense zoom in I caN’T
23:49 me during a mental breakdown
Hijo de tu madre pinchi glow💀😂😂😂🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽😍😍😍😍
Umbrella academy yessssss
Disney Villians… YES PLEASE
I WANNA KNOW * DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN * CAN YOU SHOOOOOW ME * DUN DUN *
Stunning!
Lunar Beauty isn't on beauty bay in the UK or atleast I can't find it on there :'(
Gorgous 😍😍
On camera it looks like it’s a good match
In the video why does he kinda look like someone’s sexy gay dad?
Hey Manny, any advice for people who are beginning with makeup and who have really pale skin?
Plz film the colour pop collection
Im a April baby tooooooo! ❤
❤😘
The foundation did that to me too! (The little white dots) not to mention I could see my freaking pores with it even though I used no poreblem!
Your lip color makes no sense
I just love the way you do your makeup 💓
Let’s talk! I appreciate you going out of your Comfort zone when doing your eye make up honestly I’m kind of bored of the warm cut creases that everyone seems to be doing nonstop lately. Also the dragon powder kind of shocked me I was very impressed of the difference because it was very visible on the screen.
The dad jokes are real lol
Manny you are putting your foot 🦶🏼 in your mouth 👄 lol 😆
Watches Umbrella academy
Hey!!!!!!
When you said, “I’m a dad. I’m literally a father.”  I really hope you do have kids one day. I saw your St Jude video and I think that you would make an amazing dad. I really do.  May that happen if you wish it to. So mote it be.
The only thing i dont like about ur chanell is that swear
Just rediscovered your videoes! I used to be a huge fan, I don't know why it went still for a while, because you're hilarious Manny! I'm a Sagittarius, we're both fire signs, so that must count for something!
The lash 💀💀💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂
YES PLEASE VILLAIN PALLET!!!!!!
13:52 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have another foundation that does that but I learned that I have to rub it in with my fingers so that it breaks down the white balls and then go in with my beauty blender.
You turn me on,  don’t know why
Umm. Yes. Watched umbrella academy the day it came out.. Finished that day too... Sorry not sorry!! @mannymua733
It cosmetics put a notice on that foundation on Ulta's website saying the initial launch of products had a lot more of one ingredient than it does now.. I wonder if that has something to do with what it did on your skin?
MANNY DO A VIDEO OF YOU GOING TO MARSHALLS/TJ MAXX AND DO A FULL FACE PLEASEEE THEY HAVE SO MUCH BOMB MAKEUP
Would so Hollywood work on a pale skin tone because I really want it but I’m afraid it’s too dark..?
😊🌹
Was it maybe the foundation brush giving the white specks? The brush was whire maybe it was flaking just a thought.
Omg your eye makeup skills are unbelievable!!!❤️
I thought the foundation matched really well until you turned down the brightness. I wish more content creators would insert images of their face base in different lighting
I like your sexy shirt, Manny and you've been using a lot of makeup for awhile to look pretty and hot!!! 😎🔥
(Heysofiamakeup on insta) she's so talented ! I am absolutely in love with her camo makeup series and her newest post with the blue flames ♡.♡
instagram look... SHOOKED
Hello from Indonesia 🥰 hope you enjoy Jakarta🙏🏻
I’m DYING to see you test out the Colourpop Disney Villians collection!!😍😍😍
my birthday is next week <3
Manny you need to watch The Order
I  would LOVE to see a full face of the villian makeup!!!!!
I had a Covergirl foundation that had white specks and they reached out to me and said it wasn't mixed well enough/properly. Mine kinda buffed away when I applied powder.
Love the back ground music
OMG i love Klaus toooo he was and is my favorite!! Lol try using your phone with flash to record a video next time to get the white balls maybe we can see it now that way. But we all know you've had balls on your face before Manny LMAO
I love number five     Plus.        He is cute 🤩🤩
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
😍
Lol why!!!! Smfh why lol  citycoho kiss you hardcore LOLI know you don't like girls or women whatever just want to let you know LOL
Just got that lip kit in yesterday and I’m so obsessed with it! All of them are gorgeous and the lip liner is on point!! I can’t wait to try other shades but I have a feeling the nude will be my favorite!
Can’t stand u
😍😍😍😍
I LIVE for The Umbrella Company 😍😍😍
PS: Klaus is my favorite ❤️ and i think his power is amazing. A Little creepy but amazing.
OMG UMBRELLA ACADEMY YESSSSSSS! KLAUS ALL THE WAY! HE'S SO ENTERTAINING 😂 also love you Manny!
also yes do a video reviewing the colourpop x disney villains collaborate ! 👀
My favorite is clout and he’s soo hot 🥵but power wise is probably I heard a roomer that would be so cool to have
Its never a Manny video unless hes adjusting his lashes after he just put them on😂❤❤
Klaus was my favorite. I hope they come out with more seasons
Omg love from Indonesia, Manny!!!
Is it me or is there a blank bit for awhile at 6:23? Ok I just saw your snap hehehe. No worries and when I first watched this at work I didnt notice 😂❤️ please do colourpop villains cause I’d love to see who yours is!! Btw hearing you says balls on my face at work prob wasn’t the best thing but made my Monday blues go away 😂😂 also I was able to get ur palette on beauty bay!!! My aunt got it for me and then she bought one for herself hehehehehe.
@Manny mua are this e bh brushes  good?
That color corrector did not work 😂
I’m obsessed with claus, I love other people are watching this show.
Hey guys whar lash are in the video ?? Xoxo
I’m an Aries tooo 🤗 what day is your birthday?!
Klaus is the best!
The oxidation is real
i wish i could buy this kind of makeup but minimum wage and paying bills really plays me
i want the Disney video🥰
If you use a brush with the foundation, the white specks blend out. They don't blend with a sponge.
I love klaus tooooooo 😍💖
Is the "white balls" SPF? The Loreal ProGlow does that too until u really blend it out.
U make me
Laugh... love your videos xxx
Manny: I hear a rumour.
.
.

Vanya kills Manny:-)
OMFG I was OBSESSED with Misfits! Until it started getting super weird and cast members were leaving like left and right. But omg I loved that show. Now I HAVE to watch Umbrella Academy.
Wait what??! You'll come to Indonesia again?!! And to the city where i live, JAKARTA?!!! It's like an answer from God, can't believe it... LOVE U SO MUCH MANNY! 😭😭😭😭😭❤
5 and Klaus are my favorites
You did a great job with the eyes!!! <3
OMG I hope I can meet you then! Not a makeup artist but would love to go there just to meet you!!!
I really wish you would have recorded the process of the eye look and just layer music because the main reason why I was intrigued to watch this video was the eye look! 💕
The ColourPop blushes are def not to dark, try them, you will be pleasantly surprised. They go on beautifully and are not anywhere near as dark as they appear in pan. I am quite a bit lighter then you. Also I am OBSESSED with Siren, they sure got risqué at the end there. ☺️
When manny said I am shookie wookie that was so funny.
Why did my phone not notify of this video 😓😓😓
After not watching your videos for ages, today I had a dream about you being my sorta-friend in high-school and now it's really weird to watch this.
Eyes looking bomb af hunny!! And yes, been here through the thick and thin. Everybody gotta have a little thickness in their lives...am I right or am I right?? Love you💙
Is it just me or was there a phone ringing in the background of this video....
I wish you would zoom in on the eyes.
🥰🥰🥰😂😂😂
YEAAASS ARIES
You look like Rihanna bitchhhhhh ❤️
Colourpop villains!!!!💘💘💘
No we can’t see those white specs because you didn’t zoom in
Loved this video so much💖 umbrella academy is soooooo good I binged it in a day haha 🥰
Umbrella academy is my SHIIIIIITTTT 🔥🔥🔥
29:32 😂😂😂 
Do I look like Rihanna yet...!?
Take a shot every time he says white specs 🤣💀
When he put the color corecter on I think he put it on in the weong order... I'm not hating but I love ur vids 😍
I bet nobody here knows that Umbrella Academy started out as a comic book by Gerard Way and was sold at Hot Topic back in the day. Now it's my biggest bullies' favorite show lmao
I'm obsessed with Misfits there for my favorite is Klaus! 👏🏽❤
You always make me smile....thank you.
WOW AMAZING HOW DID YOU DOO THAT
Watching this with a face mask on wasn’t the best idea.. couldn’t stop laughing!! Mans too funny 😂
Why are your show dead as mines sirens have been my sugar since day 1 and umbrella academy the last episode 😍
my Loreal Pro Glow foundation has weird little white specks in but easily blends away.
Loved the new tatcha dewy moisturizer it really makes you feel luxurious however I’ll never ever buy it ever again!! 1. Has fragrance that breaks you out and I never break out. 2. It makes your skin super shiny 3. Feels tacky and heavy... I’ll stick to my algennist power night cream. 
That orange color corrected and al of nikia products suck sorry but it’s way overpriced and sucks.... the powder has like
Glitter in it and the color correcter works but is not the price.... that tatcha cream
Does not
Feel like water it does make your skin feel nice but it is tacky and feels heavy.... I dk I do like it but I don’t I dk you guys buy it if you want but it’s not the best
Yep I see the white specs, it's not just you
Try the Muze beauty rechargable rotating foundation brush, it's on Amazon for $54.00
WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT PALLET PLEASE
WOW. BEAUTIFUL LOVE THE COLORS PALETTE
My jouer full coverage foundation dose the white speck thing and I can’t stand it I literally have to wait like 10 min for all of them to pop up and smear them into the skin then re blend
<3 u
Kinda wanna see Disney inspired looks....idk thought it would be cool ig....
Omg yess! I love umbrella academy 🤩
I laughed.. All the time.. You said ball's on my face😂😂😂😂😂😂
Klaus is definitely my favourite, and yes I used to be obsessed with misfits☺️
Hey, I’m from Jakarta, Indonesia! It’s nice to know that u’ll be here next week and i’m so excited! I hope we can meet
Watch the series 911 is 🔥💜😍😍😍
I like that Manny uses the products in reviews that he said he liked in other video. It shows us that he was honest. Im sure he knows how expensive it is for the "average human". Like no offence, i watch her vids always but i havent seen nicol concilio use the Kylie brushes that much. 
BTW: Manny im An aries 2 loll
Omg I’m crying laughing so hard. Seriously one of the funniest people to watch 😂😂😂
I wish I could finish watching but the white background gives me a headache. Love you though! 🌙
BOTH R PRETTY
I just uploaded a MAKEUP TRANSFORMATION if you want to see! 🙊 Would mean so much 😱🙌🏼
I LOVED THAT EYE LOOK😍😍😍
Tutorial on the eye look plz
“Heys-of-I-makeup” 😂😂😂 I don’t know her but I’m just gonna assume it’s Hey-Sofi-Makeup. lol
Go to the Philippines ehe
soooo prettttttty
The little balls are the silicone in the primer
❤️❤️
I love your eye color
1:13 love that show so much
So what were the dots?
When I use my L’Oréal Pro Glow I can’t use a beauty sponge as it doesn’t blend the luminous beads onto my skin. Even shaking the foundation up doesn’t work so maybe this foundation has similar luminous beads and when you switched to the sponge it put the dots on your face 🤷🏻‍♀️
Hi Manny, First of all love your brand of crazy dude! Your videos are so cool ^^
Regarding the It Cosmetics foundation, I wonder if the white dots are encapsulated ingredients that need to be broken down when you apply the foundation, hence why they tell you to apply in buffing circular motions? 
For what I can see you applied it as we normally do by stippling it on, do you think that could be why you have those white specs ? 
Could you try like half and half face one stippling/traditional application and half with buffing circular motions? I´d be curious to see if that changes anything :) 
Love you take care !
Klaus and 5 are my favorite 👀 from the umbrella academy
LOVE LOVE LOVE The Umbrella Academy. Klaus is my favorite for sure.
Ill be through everything! Like i also love Jeffree but girl i love you both and honestly dont care coz u2 separately are still sickening asf 😍
Those bloopers get me every damn time!!😂🤣😅😭💀  You slayed that eyeshadow look..it looks GORGEOUS!!😱🤩🤤😍  Another awesome video!!  Hope you had a wonderful weekend.  Love you, Manny!!💖😘 xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo 🌙🌙
“ I hired someone to do this, I did I really did” I died😂😂 love you manny♥️
Your the best!!!! Love you manny ♥️♥️♥️
I’m an Aries 4th of April xxxx
Please don't say too much about siren,  it airs so much later in the UK lols! Think we're about 100 hundred years behind USA in many ways xxx
Siren is soooo good I'm obsessed 😍
That blush is a crime.
Manny!! I died with your reaction when your lash detached.🤣🤣🤣 Love you Manny!
Manny’s eyelash falling off was the karma for him not showing us how to do the eyelook !
Love you though
L’Oréal Pro Glow has those little balls too! I find it happens when you use it with a sponge instead of rubbing and blending it out with a brush. I think it’s glitter that you kind of have to blend with the foundation. I just put the foundation on the back of my hand and blend it around with a sponge before applying and then I don’t have that issue
Hmm he is still.making these videos huhhh... I guess people don't learn
If a product isn't the same shade how is it a dupe? It's not I love you Manny but the Morphe bronzer may be nice but it's warm and the marc jacobs is neutral-cool. Completely different. Not a dupe. They're just both large bronzers.
💞💞💞
"hey guys welcome back to my channel hehehehehehe"
Your videos always bring a smile on my 😀 obsessed with your reviews❤
Dude my managers say “right on” all the time, and when you said that, I pictured Darren
🤩Do a Video & Try: THE NEW COLOR POP:🌼Spring Collection Eye Pallet CUZ they put a SUPER SHOCK Shadow in an Eyeshadow pallet for the 1st time. PLEASE!! 
😜HI! From:🌵TUCSON,AZ
YOURE GOING TO JAKARTA 😭OMG MY MOM IS FROM THERE AND IVE BEEN THERE THREE TIMES, LOVE THAT FOR YOUUU YEASS REPRESENT !  In love with you even more 💕
That eye look = SICKENINGGGG
I love all your videos of course and Yes do the Disney! I’m obsessed with Disney! And also feel free to talk about Umbrella academy! I can’t wait until season two I also heard a rumor (see what I did there?) that there’s going to be eight seasons...maybe we can talk on Twitter about the show I’m up for that but beware I tend to babble! LoL Also Klause is also my favorite as well, his powers are amazing and his character development was well done and in the end he did amazing! I can’t wait to see what happens in the next season. I may also have a tiny crush on him!
Klaus and Number Five are by far the bestests
Love the show Siren! I don’t know anyone else who watches it. It’s one of my favorites
Umbrella Academy 🤯 amazing!!
manny. I think in the past 6 months we have finally been able to see the real you. You are so damn funny ... And so likable...
i got the cover girl matte made foundation and it had white specks in it too!!! omg i thought i was the only one
okay buuuuut wear flannels more often
I’m a little disappointed you didn’t do the eye tutorial part.... maybe do a voice over with you speeding up the video? Xx
When are you going to do Avon vs marykay?
I was looking at what my traviesa daughter was doing and I hear you say, "OMG you guys, I never had balls in my face!" I literally looked at you and started laughing!! You are so funny!! (and yes, balls in my face are not uncommon)
REALLY? OMG! I WANNA MEET YOU IN INDONESIA😍❤
🙄
Next time you do an eye look like that can you do a talk through instead of just leaving and coming back??
💘💘💘
Mmmm I’m not really a fan of the body love look but I love the eye!
10:47 
My favourite is Klaus and Vanya 
But omg Allison and Luther's love story 😍 living for it
Klaus is definitely my fave! Love the vid Manny!!

❤️

You did amazing on this look! It looks STUNNING on you! Much love 💗💗💗
Love you Manny! Can you please make blushes!!! And matte liquid lips with more nude shades!?!

You should watch the show vampire diaries on Netflix you will Fall in love ❤️❤️

YASS Disney villain review 😍
I love your vids!! I wish you would zoom in a little more in your skin, or down the brightness so we can see how the foundation and the rest of the products lay on your skin.
So talented like Selenas 💯🌺
omg klaus & five
He color corrected his mustache, yet after foundation it's still quite noticeable...? No shade, buuuut...Hello? Where you at corrector? Shape Tape had to come in and do its job, plus some! ☕️
I LOVE YOU  MANNY!!!❤❤❤😘👍
OMGGG YOU GO TO JAKARTA YEY
I can't believe your 30 years old
One of the shades I got of the newer covergirl foundation had little white balls in it too, but the otyer one i had didnt have any. So maybe its something with the pigments? Idk. But when i powder my face they all brush off so idrc lol
Did someone say UMBRELLA ACADEMY???? Ok, I'll lurking and subscribe again.
Those "white balls" could probably be from the dewy primer?
Why is there so many commercials all of a sudden??? No thx.
Anyone want to make YouTube friends? ❤️❤️❤️
Umbrella academy is soo good! I need more, for real. Klaus is my faves, he's soo frickin funny 😍
Umbrella Academy duuuuuddeeeaaaa!!!!!! I freakin love it!!!!! Gerard is the fuckin best and that was just the cherry on top!!
Manny do a video about “ Full face using Sephora’s lowest rated products”.  Sending hugs and kisses from Tulare California ❤️😘 siempre linda !
Love Umbrella Academy too!
I love how the eyeshadow look turned out Manny ❤️
Dead ass no one makes me laugh as much as you. Always appreciate your reviews and humor 💓💓💓
Hijo de tu madre pinchi glow 🤣🤣🤣 morí con eso!
Hahaha I love the bloopers
Here for the colorful eye look! Also seeing all the products used!
My best friend Amanda loves that show Siren! She loves mermaids 🧜🏽‍♀️ and has even incorporated them into her beauty room. Btw her beauty room is everything and she is going to let me use it to film some soon for my new channel. So I’m super excited! She will die when I tell her about you loving Siren too! But knowing her she’s already watched this video lol. Love ya Manny♥️
Love the eye look stunning! Please do a video showing how you did your eye makeup please! Love you Manny 💖💖💖🕶👜👠🐈🐕🐎💖💖💖
I wonder if he ever gets sick of doing that little giggle lol I think its adorable but he does it for every beginning, I wonder if he ever gets tired of it xP
ARIES BABY
I thought maybe you were going to still film and voice over the eyeshadow. So sad!
I don’t get it. Right now all of these tutorials are just a sort of makeupbang, where you just chat and do your makeup and that’s good..but some of the video are just people doing their makeup off camera...why? What am I supposed to learn from that? I am not referring to this video in prticular or Manny🙌🏼 I know this is just a first impression video but still show me how did u do it!
11:08 the demon has awoken ahahaaa
Disney villain Disney villain Disney villain!!!!!
“Don’t like it if you don’t watch it”
My mom
baby... you seem schizo...
Omg I love siren, did you notice that ren’s  name is just siren without “ si “ 
 Also I fucking love you manny 😭🥰
Manny 😂 you always crack me up omg you are so cute always make me smile 😊 😘
Klaus is just the best character in my opinion 🙌🏽🙌🏽‼️‼️    (EDIT : I just pressed play after posting this and YYYAAAAYYYYY!!!!! We think the same 💕)
Please do a video with the Villans set. That would be so amazing!
omg i LOVED klaus in misfits(sorry idk his real name) but omg yes he’s hilarious
Major Lisa frank vibes on the eyes 😍😍
Dude you did such a great job on this eye look! I would love to see some more really artistic out-of-the-box eye looks because you are so amazing at them!!! ❤️❤️
10:40 I'm WHEEZING😂😂😂😂
❤️always enjoy watching your videos
you should test the different eyebrow pens that mimic brow hair!!! or even try brow extensions 😂
Love the look please do Disney one u love Disney I’ll be upset lol 😂 🥰 love u manny xx
You have to meet tasya farasya she is a beauty youtuber
I'm still waiting for him to glam Liza koshy
Shit I love your videos xxx
Love watching you..always so fun!! Wanted to try the better than sex liner ...use in another video to give more feedback..is it watery? Or does it bleed into fine lines?? I wanna know!😊
My foundation does that too! The L’Oréal infallible pro glow... when I put it on, after blending it, I’ll see white specs everywhere. But I just take a beauty blender and kinda rub them out and re blend. It is a pain tho.
I used it cosmetics CC cream. I had asked the representative for a full coverage matte foundation and that’s what she gave me. I thought I’d give it a try because maybe she knew what she was taking about. I love the way it smelled and it looked fine but more dewy then matte. Turns out it had sparkles in it! I don’t use it anymore
Ouuuuu we love a lumberjack
KLAUS.
Great video
WHAT ARE WE THINKING?! Are yall gonna buy or gonna pass?
The maybelline orange corrector is bomb. I think it’s $7.99....just sayin
Seems way to expensive for a brand new brand ... Definitely not something I'm interested in.
To be honest its nothing unique and its just very overpriced.
The egg is corny. Looks like dollar tree Easter decor.

She tried a bit too hard with the dragon thing. Didn't have to be so literal.
Nikita really over did her prices 😬 that stuff needs to be $15 for correcter and $25 for pallette...
Me before video: "This is going to be so biased."
Me after video: "Omg this is so biased." insert Pikachu meme
Hard pass! She should’ve came out with a palette instead cause what we going to do with the egg? Anyways Blue Blood launches March 29th 10am PST 1pm EST! That’s how you release something!
Girl, just get an orange concealer from L.A. Girl for less than $5.00🤷🏻‍♀️
I definitely see the difference in your beard/mustache area but not as much under the eyes
Manny looking like a pumpkin for 20 minutes straight
The packaging looks extremely cheep.  who would pay 50$$ for one egg and over 100 for both and the egg. LIKE. but I also kinda expected more as well. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
I need JeffreyStar to review this.
20 minutes just to review a orange concealer and a powder?? Wtf
you can get those eggs at target for like $3
Manny: *Puts on brightening powder *
Me: "I literally see no difference"
😐😐😐😐
Tbh, I love Nikita, but it’s a pass for me. Wish she made lipsticks or highlight
as a trans person, I was really excited when nikita said that the product would feminize a person's face, but im honestly dissapointed. both of these products exist already, and are soo pricey that many people won't be able to get it. I love nikita but im underwhelmed.
Overpriced. Not essential. Underwhelming. People tend to buy color corrector for shits and gigs and it ends up in the garbage. 

Not impressive at all.

It was nice of you to try helping out, tho.
Or get the la girl correcter for less than 5 bucks that’s works well 🤷🏽‍♀️
I’m not all the way through the video yet, but in my opinion I feel that this review MAY BE a little bit biased because Manny and Nakita are friends. 
And I’m sorry but that egg thing looks cheap to me.
Manny being a good friend for 20 minutes straight 👀
Your obviously not gonna disapprove your friends product so what’s the point of this video.
A definite Pass for me .I love Nakita but she's no makeup/ beauty maestro . Sorry guys but I can't take her 'dragun' products seriously. Give it 6 months and they'll be at T.J/ T.K MAXX .
“Ferrero Rocher egg” 😂 now that sounds like my pricing range
It's overpriced and B.A.S.I.C.
The products seem okay but the packaging makes me sad
New drinking game. 
Drink every time manny says “blue” or “warmth”
Is that a jeffreexmorphe sponge boi?!
Love color correcting, but hard candy has this same exact corrector! Literally the same exact shade and it’s like $8 😩🤷🏻‍♀️
We all know we can’t trust Manny’s reviews🙄 sorry not sorry n before anyone gets pressed GET OVER IT ITS MY OPINION NOT YOURS
ALL I COULD THINK WAS ALYSSA EDWARDS SCREAMING "GIRL LOOK HOW FKIN ORANGE YOU LOOK" 😂😂😂
Hun your face looks no different with the colour correction 😂
It’s not bad makeup it’s just basic. Like really! Nikita is a unique person (in the best way) but she made something so basic :/
$105 for nice egg and $55 for regular egg... I’m dyingggggg
The egg looks better than the actual product😬
I'm gonna say the side with Nikita makeup looks good af. Can't lie.
Won't be buying this but I'm gonna watch this anyway....and THATS the tea 💕💕💕
Is it me or does manny just repeat everything he says. If he didn't repeat himself the video would be like 5 mins long
OMG, that color really suits you! Stunning!!!! And are u working out? Man, if u were straight..... hahhaha
I love you your so entertaining to watch ❤️
Just stopped on to see how many people would bash Manny for supporting his friend.
$100 JUST TO GET THAT BLINGED OUT EGG?!?! Ohhhhh girl
When Manny keeps calling his mustache his beard 😂 Love him!
Thx YouTube for not sending me the notification you good
Lmao love ya manny😘❤️✨💋💕👑👑💕✌🏼✌🏼
Oohh, Manny is so gorgeous and flawless! I am loving how happy he is! We need an apartment tour of your new place!
Would definitely not buy it. Its way too overpriced. I think drugstore brands are more economical and perform better
Also patrick starrs video is not recommending this. And i dont trust yours
It just seems overpriced. I'm sure the quality is there but I don't get the value for the $$.
I love you manny ! I truly don’t care for this product though ☹️
This video practically convinced me to buy both the products!! but not sure that it's worth the $$
Wow it definitely made a difference!  You look 🔥.  Curious to how it wears throughout the day?
In the thumbnail he looks like a shrimp 🦐 lol ok love you manny..🥰
OBSESSED!! IM SO PROUD OF YOU!!!
Manny, I have been following your for a long time but I for the life of me find the very first video you made. Please help me!!!
Is anyone going to mention the side with the corrector looks orange?.. I love you though manny
Don't know the person, but I can't see this for all skin tones. Especially the brighten powder. I watched the entire video because I like your channel.
looks cheap and dry, she should have invested more and not just launch a product that isn't worth 25 dolars because it won't suit ALL skin tones
say no more i’m ordering mines. i needed to see this for me to take that next step and purchasing her. thanks mannymua 😘😘😘
Unpopular opinion:
I can buy better color collectors and palettes for the price of $20
I will pass. That color corrector will not work for me. I have rosacea and I use a green color corrector. This will absolutely not correct the redness in my complexion
Your freaking amazing. ♥️🤪🥰 sorry just had to 🙄✌️
packaging looks kinda cheap tbh, and there is no way those products are universal. even on the black model that was in her promo video, the powders made him look really ashy
The products are definitely overpriced... especially for the amount of product
Massive pass
I don’t see much difference on you love. Also, I wear medium coverage base and that orange would show through. I will stick with my Becca brightener.
A corrector that dries down actually makes a lot of sense! I paused before you added the concealer and the difference between the corrected and uncorrected sides is very visible. I'm surprised and impressed! I'll just experiment with a sheered out orange-toned liquid lipstick for now. But I like how you showed how this product can really work.
Love you keep up the good work.GOD BLESS U & UR FAMILY 💯🙏🤗😇
Hugs Manny! That packaging is EVERYTHING! 💜💜💜
Love you Manny!!! And love the corrector too. 🥰🥰🥰😘
Pensé que yo era la única que podía hacer eso 0:04 🤯❤
this looks dope! a universal color corrector?? Hell Yea!
I wouldn't buy it, obviously is not universal and it looks super cheap. Not worth $25
My first thought when I started watching this video was "oh my god the colour of his shirt is gorgeous!!" It suits your skin tone perfectly, you're genuinely so beautiful! Keep being awesome 😍🤩
I wish he would have used a different color corrector on other side to see difference
@Manny MUA I believe you mean the room has good "acoustics". Lol. 😊🤣😘
THAT finger!!!! I'm jealous!
Lol you said its 730 for you and I looked at the time and its 730 for me!
Hallo Manny!So Happy For you!Congrats with the New House!💙💙💙💙💙
I was starting to wonder if I was crazy because I thought the one side looked warmer. Glad you confirmed I'm not crazy lol 🤩🤩🤩
2:58 gasp ha I can barely afford maybeliine let alone lay that for an egg 🤣🤣
Thanks for the review manny!! I love that the corrector dries down quickly because I usually have a problem with correctors moving around. Most likely going to try this!
Always LOVE watching your videos ❤️ makes my day better!!!!
I do think it’s a bit expensive for what you are getting for the first launch of her products but I could definitely tell a difference. I swear Manny,  I say this all the time, YOU CRACK ME UP!! I love watching your videos and find myself saying “It eres what it eres!” Much love🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
You are hilarious, I seriously enjoy watching you ♥️😂 so much love!
I don’t doubt that it works. But I just think $1-$10 correctors work just as good. But if you want to support a smaller/newer brand then that is great!
Omg I love the tarte giveaway , fingers crossed I win , your the Best, Always uplifting your videos :) undecided about buying the egg
I freakin LOVE you!! Your EVERYTHING!! You make my LIFE!!  ❤️ U!! 😘
Manny who would not want to watch you??
You are amazing😍😍
Manny trynna be a real friend and make a 20 minute video for 2 products 😂😂
I live for the “bloopers” at end 😂😂🖤
Let me put this on my beard (puts it on mustache ) 😂😂😂 🤦🏽‍♀️
@Manny mua which anime is the eye's tattoo?? I'm dying 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😱😱
“Light REFRECTING”

Oh my 😂 it’s reFLEC
No shade at all, but I don't really see a difference, and ooh that is expensive for the first products coming from her brand.
I think I'd pass 🤔 your just the best tho Manny love you so so much 💜💋 hope you're enjoying your new place 🤗 give us a tour 😁
Slagging dragon off, in the nicest way possible 😂😂 well done lad 😂👍🏼
Maaaannnnnyyyyyy!!!!! I love you!!! You look extra swolllll in that shirt though 💁🏻‍♀️💪🏼
manny gives me life i love his videos and have been subscribed for sooo long🤩🤩
BITCHHH CLICKED SO FAST!! 💜
“you don’t have to.. but you should!” 😂🙌🏽
"what i didnt say that"🤣 love your videos and you so funny i litterally say that every video🤣😂❤️❤️
Oh my goodness I laughed so hard! “Conquer the world with my face and cock” 🤣🤣 Lmfao! Yes! And that corrected side was everything!
Love you Manny!💗💕
Dang Manny looking good!!!! I can see the biceps 💪
Acoustics. 🤗 Love you! 💛😘
Wish I watched this before the predict dropped 🤦🏼‍♀️ I neeeeeed
"Ferrero rocher egg?" me, a fatass at heart yep sounds right
Say beard one more mf time 😂🔪
HA! OMG, 😲😂... I ❤ IT!
15:14 - 15:35
"I just feel like I could conquer the world with my face and my cock. Oh wait, I, uh...did that?" 
LOL 😆... He kills me, in the best way possible!
I was totally felt that laugh in this one 💁🏻‍♀️💕
i think it loos good but you should've used way less color corrector in my opinion. try that 
p.s we love you :*
Love your videos!! You truly make my days that much better. 😘😊
Universal my ass. Manny was being nice that stuff made his foundation discolored. It's way too dark for his skintone. I'm very fair and to correct I need a more yellow peachy shade. Also those face powders would darken my face not brighten. I completely give Nikita or anyone props for creating their own company and products but don't try to make claims that aren't true. It's just not possible to have an universal color corrector. Color theory doesn't work that way.
Nikita is amazing and all but she did the beauty community DIRTY with these products. The prices are not worth it..Color correctors are different shades PURPOSELY. The different shades are for different areas of the skin as well as different tones of the skin..She was honestly better off releasing a ‘highlighter/lip stick/eye shadow palette’ ..
I keep walking around saying "Eres what eres". Thank you Manny for making it stick lmao
I love you! You are so hilarious! Your end bloopers get me everytime 😂😂😂😂😂😘
Manny you called a mustache a beard 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Another great video, huh?!?!?
Kisses from Brazil 😘😘😍😍
I’ll pass on this one but I love how it works! Thanks for the review 😘
Dnt knw I need to cover dark spots on my face so I done tried everything and it's high price when I just want one item
I rather buy $100 worth of eggs. 🤦🏻‍♀️
I understand people thinking the products are too expensive for what they are... but this whole “she’s not even a known brand”/“she’s not a big brand” therefore her products should be cheaper is dumb. Indie brands are ALWAYS more expensive then mainstream/commercial brands. You don’t start a business, create products & sell them at lower prices to Start, because you’re a new brand. Then once you’re more well known, increase prices. 
That’s just not how business works.
Like I said, I do agree, that it’s too expensive for what  it is. But that kinda reasoning is stupid as hell. But
Yo like Nikita DID THAT! 💛 LOVE!
For that price it better transform me into a goddess!! Seriously that is costly
Ugh love you manny! You're such an inspiration 😭😩💕
The reason why the perimeter of your face is warmer from the corrector is because correctors are only supposed to be used on the blue areas and not blended out onto where your skin doesn’t need color correction. Learned that in school (I went to Make-up Designory) and from experience. But other than that, it looked great! Thank you for the review, I love that it dries down completely so that it doesn’t mix in with the foundation because that happens to be quite a lot. So definitely worth $25 only because all the cheaper correctors aren’t as matte and just blend with the foundation. Thank you, Manny! This video was super helpful! 💕✨
Omg manny you are my fav you are so funny 😂😂😂 the ending 😂😂
And the Spanish word of the day is: Bigote, which means Mustache 😉 thank you Manny for this awesome review 😘
Manny’s under eye bags look a LOT more noticeable on the side with the corrector.
these actually are so sickning you look SNATCHED manny go nikita gurl slay
Dude. Manny needed that brightening powder. He needs to cover those hard working lack of sleep circles that peek through!!!
Thank you for telling us the prices 🙏🏻
Love how your so supportive to everyone in the industry 😭❤️ that powder is AMAZING!!!!
Mustache manny, MUSTACHE 😂❤️
We can even use liquid lipstick for colour correcting
Talent : making a 20 minute video with only 2 products to review
Manny this is y I love u lol 😂 u made me laugh your the best mwha xx 💋
Legit, that color corrector made such a difference on your eyes and mustache. So good!
"let me just add a little fix plus" sprays half the bottle loveee Manny
that's not your beard manny, it's your moustache!  <3 you~
I love color correctors!! I use the maybelline peach color corrector and it works wonders 😫🙌🏽
WE GET IT, IT DRIES DOWN VERY QUICKLY fuuuuuuck move on
Tell me why every comment I read so far has been hate on Nikita's egg.
The last two minutes of this video are the BEST, lol. Love you Manny <3
also the idea of a universal colour corrector doesn’t really make sense with colour theory. everyone has different skin tones with different undertones. that one colour corrector shade will not even be close to ideal for everyone.
What we blend, extends Mannyyy. Dont use as much corrector under your eye. Then it wont make your perimeter oxidize
Love the brightening powder!!!❤
Oh my god it looks amazing! I love it and I'm so proud of Nikita ♥️
honestly i didn’t see a difference..
i love Nikita! I really do, but her new make up products that she came out kinda disappointed me:(  (~my opinion~)
Flawless as always. I watch your videos for eyeshadow tutorials because we have the same eyes. I also has super small hooded lids. Love you!! ❣️❣️
i love you so much, you’re such an inspiration☺️❤️
He's like the gay version of Dr. Mike. Idk, maybe it's just me. 🙄
Honey don't worry, I work on that set up all the time. 😂
anyone else wish they had an unlimited budget for makeup?! 😭

Does anyone want to be yt friends? 💖🌺🌴
Face palette reminds me of Claire’s makeup 🤷🏼‍♀️
It looks amazing. I love it. U should color correct more
I didn't even know this launched and I'm still not interested🤷🏻
Your skins amazing!! Love your videos 😍😍
Omg love this. That brighter looks amazing
The bloopers at the end are golden😂😂❤️❤️
I love this review I needed this and I can see it how different it looks!! Gonna buy thanks hermosa 😘😘
You can definitely see the difference!! Congrats to nikita on this amazing product and creative idea to come up with something that is not on the market alot and manny keep up the good work love u
Did you mean to say your room has good acoustics? 🥰😂❤️
"It doesn't take forever to dry (but it dries down pretty fast)"
I watched this at work when it came out but decided I wanted to watch again because I can really pay attention and also leave a comment 😁 again so happy you are in your new place!!!! So exciting!!! Are you going to get Mr Kate to design your new place?? ❤️❤️
I don’t really color correct so this is not for me but I think this is good for people with very dark under eyes 💕
You‘re so fanny manny🤪 love that spanish 😻😻
It’s 5:34 am!!!! Getting ready for work
If she was gonna come out with a color corrector and powder she should have at least made different colored ones to suit different skin tones and needs 🤷🏻‍♀️
Anyone else hear beard and think nahh that's a stache like 100 times 😂😂
I could definitely tell a difference between both sides, big congrats to nikita for her first launch!!! I however dont color correct so that definitely wouldn't be for me but that brightening powder looked hella good that I will probably be purchasing!!! Much love your way💙💙💙💙💙💙
As someone with super dark circles(hereditary) I color correct everyday but I'm not buying that product my becca color correct it's perfect. I would use foundation everyday with that color correct as with the Becca I can just apply it and I'm good to go.
I’m not opposed to the powder 🤔🤔 butttttt I may need to buy it idk lmao I need some more convincing
OMG I died at the very end 😂😂 Pierre 😂😂 I can’t with you, you crack me up so much I love you!!
Just watched her video saying she had stuff coming! Very curious
I'm so happy for you getting in to your new place can't wait till you get all unpacked and maybe a little tour BIG HUG 🤗
It would be a pass for me. The powders on your face definitely accentuates your pores. I like your videos but to me it doesn’t seem unbiased.
Take a shot every time manny says “undertone “. Lmao.
Legit can’t wait to see your background set up for your new beauty room ❤️🤓
Manny please us your original background. This one makes you look grayish or something idk lol...
Bloopers are always my favourite 😂😂
Omg Manny, CC looks amazing on you!
Yesss! They look like great products!🖤
I really like the idea of the brightening powder, with a subtle sheen. Does anyone know any other possibly cheaper powders with the same claims?
i love nikita but to be honest the packaging look so cheap. 😂
Cheap looking and chalky looking 
I pass
If u wanted to cover ur mustache completely I would correct there but no where else! I PERFER the way ur under eyes look on ur normal side cuz there's color transitions and makes it look highlighted under there. And on the corrector side of under eyes it looks one flat shade
The “impeach trump” ad had me dying 😂😂👏
Anyone else noticed he used the glowy Laura mercier to set under eyes...then the nikita dragun powder to brighten 🤔 not really a fair shot
Videos always entertaining forever making me laugh 😂
Nooo I loved your older setup ! It's what sets you apart from so many other YouTubers 💔
I mean much respect for anyone starting a business and having a brand. But personally i don't colour correct. I'm fair and this is not the color for me if I want to color correct my under eyes I'm suppose to use yellow. Medium deep yes I think it's fine. Plus it's way over priced sorry that's my truth. Good luck to nikita i think she's sweet and makes me laugh.
Hey manny ! please do a review on makeup revolution i heart chocolate palettes ! pleaseeeee!!!! i can blindly trust on your reviews ! they are so on point & accurate ! lots of love from Pakistan !
I see all these negative opinions about her band/products but honestly i think her starting out with something completely different than any other brand is awesome. I am getting so sick of only seeing new eyeshadow palettes and highlighters. This is so cool and different and something that she uses and swears by. I love the concept and packaging like the dragon egg and scales i feel like its really HER and im so excited for it!💜🐉
I've been excited to see how the Dragun Beauty products work! So excited for Nikita! I never color correct but seeing the difference side by side here totally made me want to.
Manny. You look snatched 😏😍❤️
Your skin looks so good and fresh 😍 What color corrector would you use to cover acne scars? 🤔
It reminds me of the huge dollar store eggs u can get for 2$!
okay I feel like I have to put this out there but we are not hating on her product's I personally believe they work and everything but people are just giving much more options bc u  can get the same product and results for a much cheaper or affordable price, that's just my opinion 😉
Congrats on the new house Manny!🎉
Omg.... I absolutely love you!!! 😂💓😂
I've been waiting for it! 🤩😊😊
Omg the correcter totally worked! I see the difference bish
yes with the color corrector & the powders, I pops your eyes out. It brightens your eyes 😍😍 soo cute
What brand sponge is that? It blends beautifully!
So are we gonna get a house tour ? I NEED ONEEEE❤
Manny! I need to know what sponge you're using? I'm so intrigued. I can't find it. 😂 I need that baby ballerina pink in my life!
I don't watch Nikita, but I don't think she did her products justice. She wanted something new to offer the market, but no one is demanding color correctors. If she wanted this to blossom into more, she should have launched with something more in-demand, like lip kits, highlighters, or a palette. Smaller things like she is offering seem more appropriate for a bigger company. She could have come out with a really awesome eyeshadow palette, but the choices she made are just not right for me.
Bish.. where? 👀 I see no difference. 

No shade to you tho Manny. ❤️ You slay without makeup hunty.
the mustache at the end 😂😂 the brightening powders did look amazing, are they the same as the hourglass ones? but actually in the end I liked the way your complexion looked on the uncorrected side a little bit better, the orange-y inner corner bothered me for some reason
Honestly i see no difference btw colour corrector side and nomarl side
The bloopers at the end are my favorite 💞
I really hope this works because nothing covers my blue undertones . Especially my dark circles What makes it worse they sink in 😓
Manny calling his mustache his beard😂😂😂
Bro just get an Easter egg at the dollar store. Same quality
I could actually see the difference between each side of your face. I suffer from hyper pigmentation around my eyes and ive tried a lot of products that just dont work. I know lots of people complain about the price but other correctors dont dry right. I like that you mentioned that. Im going to have to try this.
Can't wait to see the glam room when it's all set up.properly I love seeing u back to us bubbly self...love u
I’ve never clicked so fast on a notification before!!! Love you Manny!!! 😘😘😘
I love the packaging!❤️
You're a nut! Crack me up every time!! I just love your videos!!
I rather buy a lilstick and put it on my face haha
Omgosh. Manny. Loving this video. ❤️
It’s look not so good 
A cheaper brand can do a better work than these overpriced egg 🥚
Anytime he said “blue on my face” all that went on in my head BUST DOWN THOTIANAaaaAAAAaaAaaA hahahahhaha
Manny you have changed in the past months and I've really enjoyed watching you and seeing the growth!
Forever wishing I had NO budget for makeup
I literally always say itrriss what itrris lmfao you're the best
when you say darker areas do you mean like hyperpigmentation?
Take a shot every time Manny says "blue undertone" ... we get it dude.
The packaging looks cheaply made however it's the product that matters
I love to color correct my under eyes with orange but I've found most correctors to be either very texture enhancing, thick and hard to blend; too pigmented and the oranges pulls through too much even under foundation & concealer & with a small amount applied; or they lack pigment and enhance my circles... I'm really tempted to try this color corrector. I don't care if it "seems" like Nikita put more effort into marketing instead of the product. To ME, that corrector looks promising as hell in almost every review I've seen. I remember when Nikita use to use the LA Girl one waaaaaaay back in the day (as did I) & she had the same problems with it, she'd have to apply extra foundation over her corrector because it would alter the foundation color. If she used less, it wouldn't cover as much as she needed it to. (I'm talking Nikita on the floor with a pixie cut videos lmfao)

I think she did a good job with these products. Extra AF with the packaging, like her style; they seem to have a dope formula; I love how she took her experience with makeup & the problems she faced as a Trans woman applying makeup & improved upon something "basic" but essential to many; 

Y'all give too much hate on products that don't suit your needs & no one is forcing you to buy lmfao

Congrats to the Dragun queen, shit's fuego. Would love to see you use these products but doing an extra AF drag look! :3
Hey manny... uhhhm i don’t think that I caught it.... does the color correcting dries fast orrr???? 🙄😂
I thought that was a Cadburys Easter Egg😂🐷
Love you Manny but I feel like you were struggling to like it. I know she's your friend but I can tell you were forcing yourself. ♥️👑🤷🤷🤷🤷
Manny I love this video EXCEPT why did you not comment on the ridiculous price point? Come one now 😒 still love you though!
IT DRIES DOWN REALLY QUICKLLYY
Ohhh nooo sweetie, what was u thinkin 😬🤧
Honestly the colour corrector did nothing from what I can see
Real title : reviewing my ex best friend's new sutff ...
Faberge honey, it's called a Faberge egg 🥚🍳🥚
I'm so glad you reviewed this❤️❤️❤️
I love the fact that when you put up the side name things you made the one with no color corrector white and the one with it is orange

If this even makes sense
I missed you yesterday! I am glad to be here today!! Hey, prettiness!!
Being from the uk I’m never this early! 🥰 that colour shirt really suits you btw 💕💕
You’re so funny 😂 I can’t wait to get my hands on this!! ❤️
I can definitely tell the differences. I love products like these that make a subtle but really big difference if that makes sense. The powder made the skin so smoothe and bright, I need it.
It´s just me or both sides look almost he same lol ... Way too overpriced!
I'm so pale peach color corrects for me. I love Miss Dragun but this collection is a no go for me.
Living for this clear skin Manny, I hope you’re liking the new place. Much love! 💜💜💜💜
I think the product did a very good job for you. I don't feel like I have the blue hues so I probably wouldn't pick up the color corrector liquid. The powder though, I probably wouldn't pick those either lol. But I love you Manny 😍😍😍😍
Omg love how you are showing us by comparing. So far the video reviews I have watched for this product they just apply it. And I’m like WHAT DOES IT DO?!!
LOL
Love you sooo much bb!!! 💕💕💕
Imma just buy $50 dollars worth of easter eggs and $1 corrector hehehehe.
I think you meant the room has acoustics. Lol. Living for that curly mustache at the end.
does anyone notice that the packaging of the individual products looks exactly like lipstick queen’s?
I see a difference but I don't think ill buy. Its too much for 25.
Skin is poppin like a bucket of Garrett's popcorn Manny. 👀
I LIVE for the bloopers 😂💕💕
Mustache manny, not beard 😏😂😍😍
I mean, the results of these makeup products look very similar to something drugstore products can offer. For a brand new makeup brand line, these products are simply not worth the price.
"You don't have to like me, but you should!" I love that shimmy-shake with it!!! 
I live that you are supporting your friend. I would buy it just for the dragon egg. I think it looks so cute!!
If the egg was rose gold would of been better maybe could of made it like a purse could of add
More to
The concealer
And powder
Lowkey feel like his left side looks better and brighter lol
LOVE YOU MANNY!!!! 😘😘😘 You're a beautiful person inside and out!
Okay so this is basically a promo not a f**** review let's just be honest
Kristi did dragun beauty color corrector too! Love yall. Yall are so freaking cute! When I saw yall at the tarte convention (by saw I mean the video lol) I kept thinking how adorable you two are !
I didn’t know yall were still kool...🤔
No disrespect, pero no mames .... que no se pase de vvvvvvv lol expensive af for what it is
I’ve been having such a crappy week and watching your videos (this one and your last one) have made me feel so much better. Thank you for being so amazing! Love you 💕💕💕
Mr. Kate renovation for your new place soon?!
LOVE your videos, they’re always so entertaining! lol
Ngl the packaging reminds me of drugstore makeup. Plus it’s soooo expensive! I love the idea of coming out with something unique upon first launch but so many more people would be into it if it were more affordable!
I think manny’s review was for sure honest and genuine, and I don’t think he was bias when it came to how the actual
Product performed. But c’mon man, that price range is fckn wack. The products definitely work, but you can get soooo many other correctors that work just as well if not better for like 5 bucks. Wish he brought that up. Also, I do believe that the color corrector is universal because either way, any foundation will cover up the color corrector underneath so it doesn’t really matter what skin tone you are, the color corrector won’t even peak through to begin with.
Heyyyyy beautiful! What have we got in store todayyyy xx
Keep on going to make the good video !!  i support you and we love you
Holy Shit! That stuff is amazing! Question, what do you think about the Fenty foundation?
He said "I'm not gonna be completely honest"
I literally see a difference and i think it looks great!
review JSC BLUE BLOOD palette :)
Manny are you looking for the word acoustics?  and you said octave?
I thing I just found one of my new favorite YouTubers
Manny, I just love youu ❤
I love you so much Manny Mua aka Queen. I love all of your videos so much. You're such an inspiration to me
It looks stun on you, manny! I’m not so much of a color corrector so it’s probably a pass for me.
Both sides look the same, very small difference but no on the correcter. Save yalls coin sis.
I think the word you were looking for at the end (in the bloopers) was “acoustics” 😘
If you love it so mucccchhhh, you'll use it in continuing videos , that'll be the real determining factor on whether or not it's good🤔
don’t drag our queen nikita 😳 @anyone
I’m super exited for this! The way you described how useful color theory is for your face in color correcting was beautiful! I love your passion for any form of makeup (especially DRAG) 🤘🏻🧡
My father is from Argentina and my mother from Spain (and I'm french lol), and I swear you and my brother look identical (just he is a very masculine man, but very sweet and openminded), and very close to some of my argentinian cousins. If I didn't know who you were, I would have thought we were related. Crazy.
Early squad today!!!🌙⭐💛 Yaaaaasssss😁😁😁  love ya manny💕 
I think the color corrector did an amazing job! You can definitely tell a difference.
That price tho... humble yourself girl
I wonder if it gave warmth 😂🤣
I wonder if the color corrector would oxidize if you used less of it? Looks cool tho
i love the beard AND makeup! can you use an eyebrow pencil for it?
Omfg he said ferrerro rocher 🤦🏽‍♀️🙄🙄😂😂 

The chocolate manny, yasss lol
I love that you reviewed this!!!! I was waiting for one of my favorite male gurus to review it💜
Wow it looks good actually like I can't see ur beard on camera ♡
The fact that many is calling the Mustache area his Beard area is hilarious 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭
Not really much of a color correction user but, it's you so I watched :)  love me some manny!!! Insta-cerriejean_aka_mossymoon
Blue, warmth! Thank you for this video Manny! Love and appreciate your honesty!
As with a lot of makeup I feel this is just buying the name as a lot of color correctors are great for pretty low prices but hey if you got the extra coin get it girl..and boy!
@simplynailogical I heard the word holo 👀👀👀😏
I'm actually digging this sleek setup
that is expensive wtf
They are called Fabergé eggs. Love you!❤
Thank you, NEXT 😂😂😂🤙🏻
How you gonna say you used translucent glow under your eyes 😂 we now that ain’t right 🤔
That is drag makeup. He did good making a good colour corrector for drag.
I’m shocked  your skin really did look great with the color corrector on it I was really amazed
what were them index fingers doing in the intro 😂😂😂
Why are you still following Romeo Lacoste? You are shady da house
I loved this!! I just uploaded a WISH try on bikini haul if you want to see- would mean so much 🙊🙌🏼
I noticed a difference and it looked good 😊 I can always count on you to make me laugh😂😂 Love you!❤️
Your skin looks so amazing , I livvveeeeeee😫😍😍You can actually see the comparison!!! Love you 😍😍😍
Things that drive me crazy about Manny's videos :
1) when it's quiet, you hear his nose whistling.
2) he's said he doesn't speak Spanish but throws out Spanish phrases like a white girl in her first foreign language class.
3) copies other people's quirks, badly. 
4) biased reviews.
manny saying “blue undertones” for 10 mins straight
I love Nikita, so this is NOT a hate comment, but who did her packaging?!?!? If you need a graphic designer, call me up sis.
It looks like Claire's... and dont even get me started on that egg....  
Wish you the best, but I wish you would have taken a step back and gave the packaging a second though.
It's pretty gorgeous, and so are you
STUNNING! I’ve never colour corrected but I’m gonna! ✨
damn manny sold me on this 😩
Beautiful Thank you for Sharing Beautiful
I can't even watch manny without thinking about how much he reminds me of the brother on schitts creek.  🤣🤣
Ooooh March 25th
My birthday ❤️❤️ 22nd birthday
That concealer girl. I have very dark bluish/purple under eye circles. So I'm ready to try
Lol the room has octaves, that would be sickening if sounds just changed octaves in a room....the word you’re thinking of is Acoustics lol
What we really want to see if the blue blood review 😂😋😋😋
I love the end of your videos.  The bloopers and outtakes crack me up :)
Manny, I really enjoyed this video review. But I need to watch someone else’s review on this product that’s not such a close friend... just sounds a little bias. Still enjoy watching this video ❤️
To me I see a softer look on the corrector side the other side not so much ❤️
Manny: “Let me put on little fix plus also Manny puts half of bottle on “ 😅
VIDEO IDEA!! Do a video of you doin FULL ON DRAGGGGG♥️ I mean the look, the hair, the clothes, EVERYTHING ♥️
The models before look WAYYY better than their after 🙄 no 🍵 no shade
You can tell a difference. But I honestly don’t want anything to effect the shade of my foundation.
Even when he was done putting on the face makeup, where he has concealer under his eye isn’t bright anymore
Watching your videos are the highlight of my night!! U rock!!
I actually like the warmth it brought to the face... it looks really good...
I don't like hating on makeup brands, but this packaging just looks cheap, and it is pretty expensive. for that price, the packaging should have been dragon colored, like green or blue, you know? Something different. There was just opportunity lost!
Mann you so FIT 🤤 YES WE LOVE A SKINNY QUEENNNN
take a drink every time Manny says "blue undertone"
It’s fun Manny  we love you!! ❤️
I was so happy this morning when I saw a new Manny video ❤️
Ok and it can work but are YOU gonna use it everyday
okay honestly manny’s undereyes always look good but they’ve never looked THIS bomb....i’m shook 🤤 also thank you manny for teaching me that the reflective powder without a corrector just brings out the blue...i never knew that and always wondered why reflective brightening powders didn’t work well for me!
lmao @15:35 im dead...We gonna conquere with our kitty 😉😂😂
Gorgeous I can't wait till it comes out in Australia
Let's count how many times he says it covers the blue
Early squad!! Yes!!! Love you Manny!!😁😁😁🖤🖤🖤😘
Coming from the guru that constantly stares at himself!
You're so beautiful Manny, inside and out. I love your videos you always bring a smile to my face. Thank you!
i love nikita and i think this goes with her brand, but i personally dont use color corrector, so i wont be buying it. X( looking forward to future launches!
The difference on the upper lip is noticeable but otherwise not much....sending love from 🇸🇬
Clicked on the vid right away so excited just stared
take a shot every time manny says “more” “less” “undertone” “blue” and “warm.”
He’s her friend and obviously not giving the real T !!! We want all t all shade hunty !!! We need Jeffrey’s review period !!!
Looks like he is Nikita selling the product
I’ve been loving Beauty Bakerie flour setting powder for my under eyes but this has piqued my interest!!! 😍
Your giggle is adorable 💖😂
The bloopers are my favorite part always!
takes shot every time “blue undertone” is said
We need a count for the “warm” and “blue” words used, please.
the color corrected side looks soooooooo lifted and brightened 🤩
I live for you, you mother effin queen😍🤩
I got Cadbury Easter egg vibe and the price is a little pricey but it looks really nice
U never needed to color correct cause you have amazing skin.
When someone says they are proud of you especially someone around your own age it just seems condescending or is it just me?
Uhm makeup revolution has palette in a egg shape for 6$ !
After a stressful move your videos are a welcome distraction ❤️❤️
Ig: Kassidyturner01
I dont see any difference when you apply the corrector and the powder looks chalky. All in all I do not think its worth the price.
Omg ! That is fabulous . Do you think that might work for my chin. 
I  am a woman who has to shave my chin in certain areas because of all the hair I grow there . 
And yes I am forever battling with a blue undertone no matter how full the coverage !
who saw manny mua on Hoda and Kathie Lee on NBC 😁😊😊
I love you Manny. Cant wait to see the new place!
This seems so biased 🤦🏻‍♀️
I think manny should have shaved to see how it works over the beard area I know the beard is his thing but just saying
Damn it, Manny. It’s your mustache. You put the corrector on your mustache!! 😂
Color corrector looks so nice!!😍😍 really impressed!!😍
Y’all!! Whoever wants me to bling their $1 egg from Dollar Tree, just hit me up. I got a glue gun that works just fine.
I’ve never color corrected but I would honestly give it a try after watching this. I might not buy this one, but I’ll wait for more reviews. ❤️
Maybe the color corrector is in fact universal but the powders need more shades!!
But sister Nikita is is queen and I live her ❤
The vibe from this video made me really content. You are so uplifting❤️
this is my first video of his but does he always talk this fast haha
I have never used a color corrector. I like Nikita and her story. But I rather save my coin for your new products!! Which BTW!!!! when are they coming ??????????? I need saya lippie!!
I would love to see you try covering a tatto with these two products plus a nice full coverage foundation
"Should I finish my makeup up? It's already 8:00 🙃......no no no no, we're taking it off"....LOL SAME honestly same. 💯
Although I actually like you manny, I think you were ALWAYS going to be bias reviewing this product because you are both friends which you have said that you go wayyyy back. Therefore, I can’t trust this review as naturally you were not impartial due to the relationship you have with her 🙄
Manny!!!! Te Amo!
This was cool to watch. Very different like you said- it all looks nice!
I don’t really have discoloration, but if I did I would purchase this! I definitely see the difference! The powders look beautiful too. Honestly I would purchase just to support the trans community. 💕
My daughter got so excited to see a new manny video she loves you we watch your snaps together every day ❤
Happy spring 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
You are so funny! Love ya!! ❤️
Notification squad, where you at!?
Seriously this is a helpful content.
I actually really like the white background!!!
Starts using the product at 4 57💖
All Ima say before I watch this is ....u better not come for mother dragon cuz I barely forgave u
Love this review! I did see the brightening effect of the color corrector. That's nice that it dries down so people don't have to use more layers! Saves you from being cakey!
Oh hunny, you tried pero this ain’t it 😭
Manny please heart this message, from Ireland but living in England! Your videos get better every time! Loved the shoulder action at the end of the intro, had to watch erm TEN TIMES 😂 we love youuu!!! 💙💙💙💙
I don’t see a difference in the correcting concealer besides the fact that it made your foundation oxidize. I think you might have used too much.. 🙂
8:01 oh you can see a difference x nice although if you cant afford it la girl is meant to have some great ones x
Stopped everything for u my fav u r so beautiful love u
You really do look bright and awake on the Nikita side...  You don't even need eye makeup.  Loved it and cannot wait for it to come out to get it myself. BYW...  I love all of your videos but I really watch them for the bloopers...  LOVE THEM!!!!!!!  Please never stop doing them!!!!!!
18:54 we love a bad girl 🤣🤣😂😂
Stop telling ppl to stop watching you. It is very negative and I can choose for myself if I want to watch or not. I think you are amazing and so should you. muahhh
Haven’t even watched the video yet, and I can already say with confidence that I LOVE IT! You keep me hella entertained! Love it! 😘
I love that you have such a thorough review of the two products! You did amazing sweetie lol! You look amazing!!! Congrats Nikita wit yo fine azzzzzz🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 I want the powder for sure!!
"I know the actual launch of these products was pathetic, so I'm just going to sit here and repeat myself over and over again until people believe that it's worth it." 

This launch was so underwhelming, over priced, and in general just a shit show. They might work but they are not at all worth what they are being sold at retail, I'd be better off with other brands.
Remember when she killed him on Escape the Night.
I don't know what I love more, Manny; your wonderful videos or your HILARIOUS Bloopers!!!! Keep up the great work, we love you!
Yes the corrector worked. Nice 👍
Omg you said it 7:30 at night and it’s 7:30 am for me😂
🤣🤣🤣 Pierre!!!
You look like my school bus driver
Wait, you're friends again?
I think you mean your rooms acoustics, not octaves. Just trying to help :)
While compared to most of the people who comment on your videos, I am almost as old as dirt, but I think I absolutely adore you🙂
The nikita side looks so smooth!!!
OVERPRICED!! love u tho manny 😘
Hola chica lol I watch all your videos cause your personality es EVERYTHING ☺️ and just love you vibe and uniqueness
He literally kept saying the same thing over n over n over 😑
Anyone else notice Manny’s nose whistling at 15:57? 😂♥️
Love u.. Ur hilarious
Ahhh! The YouTube video I have been waiting for! Love watching you Manny!! And so excited for Nikita’s makeup line!!❤️❤️❤️❤️🐉🐲
It's a Faberge egg 😂 in case no one else has told you lol
I love it because it ads some warmth to your skin.  And By looking at it I can see the good quality.
I love Nikita but I honesty don't see a difference...is it just me?
Sweetie your liquid eyebrow lift is janky
these products are so expensive , LA Girl has the same colour corrector for $5 😕.
Big difference! Love you 🖤
I have a cheaper color corrector that works just fine but I literally never use it so I will be passing on that. I have been interested in brightening powders since KKW came out with hers so I am interested in that. I do wish the products were a little cheaper though.
I will definitely pass on this
Oh I would not be spending extra for the egg let alone 50 quid
Anyone else getting 1970 porn vibes with that background music?
Bonjour Pierre.. Comment allez vous? 😏😁😍. That was a good video.. your video seem to be getting better and better you are explaining things much better you're not just talking showing a product.. 'm really enjoying your work.  Thank you ❤🇨🇦
Soooo..... 😐 if I want a blinged egg the price is higher this is comedy for sure.
I have no words 😶
Is MANNY MUA  still have a relationship with NIKITA DRAGUN ??? 
I am just wondering if that's true, have you known forgot the issues? 
And honestly come on. No shade to Nikita. 
Pd. I also think that both of them are good at doing makeup 💙
I think you used too much because it spread to areas you didn’t need it but still looks nice!
I feel so awake and so.. I feel like i can conquer the fucking world with my face and cock😂🤦🏼‍♀️ i can’t 🤣
 I totally notice a difference I’m loving it. The brightening powders really do work so great ✨
You had me dying hunny 😂🤣
Nikita Dragun DONE GOOD! 👍
I can honestly not stand when this man when he bites his lip with his dental teeth it drives my nerves up the wall bro
I feel like you have been a lot more genuine lately or maybe I am crazy lmao either way I’ve been really enjoying your videos the last few months (not that I haven’t always but your vibe feels a little different now) you seem happier. 💕
cheesus this video made sleepy af 🙄
It's 4:28 PM right now
Wow wow wow! I saw the difference so much! And I'm like u with how I think of color correcting. I'm scared to put a bright orange color but thank you for showing me a product that looks like works!
I would never buy it tbh!!! 25 bucks for a damn colour corrector??? And 35 bucks for that powder? I can get a Laura Mercier powder for that price. No honey. I like her but no!! I’ll pass
I like your vid it’s very informative
I am happy for her but I think it would've been a better move if she would've done like trans supporting lingerie, when she released the video of her in angel wings advocating against VS. 
But anywayy maybe shell do it in the future!!!
Damn Manny now I want the concealer and the powder 😂💁💯💄👸 I am old and I have purple veins 🧐 👏🏻
Please don’t open any of the products with your teeth 😂❤️. But seriously I keep going back and watching that part of the video. Congrats on the new home!!!
You use so much blush. I wish you'd tone it down a smidge.
Of course he would recommend that’s his friend. 
That product is over priced you’re just buying the brand
You should do an orange look it makes your eyes look beautiful
I think is great but a bit $$$.
Love this , and love you!!
This all seemed very repetitive 😕 especially in the beginning with the corrector. Still love you though
Am I gonna buy?! HELL TO DA NOOOOOO!!!!
"Blue... warmth. Blue... warmth." 😂😂😂😂
Start to finish 🌴🕶
Shook by the finger thing 😂😂
Does the colour corrector dry down fast? Or does it dry down fast? Does it dry fast? It seems like it dries down fast to a powder...like it dries to a powder fast 🤣🤣🤣 Manny saying how fast it dries down for 10mins straight 🤣🤣😂😂
OMG! Pierre... this was hilarious!
lolllll I liked the video right when he did the finger thing at the beginning
You surely talk fast😂
Manny I love u and Nikita but u looked like a oompa loompa
take a hit every time he says blue undertone
I'm amazed by Nikita but in my opinion this falls flat. I love that it's something different but also think she could've really done so much better. I still live her though!
pretty sure these will end up at forever 21 where they belong
😂😂😂 I think we should cut the giggle out and just do the finger dance. 😂😂😂😂
I have been waiting for your thoughts on this!! Love how honest you are even when reviewing friends. Love you Manny ❤️❤️
When you were talking about those eggs tell me why I thought of Harry Potter and the Twiwizard tournament lol. Then I remembered a faberge egg duhhhhh
My la girl color corrector works just fine for 3$
I think you wanted the word acoustics
I think the finished is beautiful natural and give u a quite tan look which is preety but the price to me.. Naah sis
Manny you made me laugh so hard I. The beginning! Love you .
Omg it looks so good!
Why did you change it from exposed to tested
What would you rather see BLUE or ORANGE underneath 😅😅😅 I'd rather see neither
i live for the bloopers hahaha 😂
It seems cool but it doesn’t really wow me. Nothing we haven’t really seen before tbh. Best luck to her and her  brand though.
I adore u Manny u light up my days lol
I love the nose whistle at 16:00 😂❤️
Does it dry down quickly or ....      😂😳
I love how he used a picture of Nikita from Escape The Night
Manny you are so amazing you are so talented and inspirational i love you so much!!!!!!!!!💘💘💘💘💘😍❤️💘
nikita is way to boujee for this packaging but if she worked hard, gotta support.
you’re so pretty and sickening
All this did was persuade me to use a colour correct under my eyes and to look for an affordable brand. It works for sure, but not worth the dough!
take a shot every time he says warm
Can you review Mary Kay 🤣
eh....color correcter is nice and all. but a full coverage concealer would work fine. plus its way too warm for those with pale skin. no one wants to be orange.
I can't even lie, as lame as I think this launch is, the side w the color corrected did look absolutely beautiful
Lmao who edits and adds the product names.. I know you did not like the LM glow setting powder 😂
Who else came here to see Manny kiss Nikita’s ass? Lol
Love you Manny!💕
This was so forced it killed me🙊 all I see is orange undertones.
likes video before it even starts 💕💕
"dry out fast", "almost feel like a liquid lipstick", "dry down to a powder" yep that's basically all the descriptions you can have for a terrible color corrector.
First,  "acoustics". Your room has good acoustics. Second,  I have fair mature skin (read, old white girl) I have veins that show through in a couple spots and when I wear foundation it always looks like I've smudged something on my face. I never thought to use a color corrector. I mean "duh" but I think I'm gonna try this.
Why are you so cute ? lol I love you 😩
This launches on my B-Day awwww
Congratulations on your new place. Its 12:33am here in Fond du lac Wisconsin and this is nana from Wisconsin.  Love your beauty looks. Saw you in video in Hawaii with Rawbeautykristy. Zipplineing. Why cool. I'm 65 but still love to try that. My son lives in Malibu,  next time I go there I'm going try to talk him into trying it. Love ya.
Manny youre so cute😂
I personally don't like correctors because I feel like it peeps through the foundation/concealer no matter what, particularly the green and orange correctors so I don't like that.
Ya the make up is probaly $5 and the brand name is $100 like maybeline has makeup for $7.99 and it looks nicer😒
i wish you could have compared it to the la girl color corrector ! that would have been a great beauty battle ! love you manny ♥️♥️♥️
Take a shot every time you hear Manny say “egg”
105 for an egg???? I dont think so!!! Manny talks to fast
Wait does anyone know why he moved out from his last place?
Soooo ...anyone else notice that he used a JEFFREESTAR x morphe sponge?! 👀
The room has good acoustics. That's what you were thinking.😂💖
FERRERO ROCHER EGG OH MY LORD
The only thing universal is Salt. I mean all of us need it but I do not think Nikita's products are.
By the way Haters it’s already sold out😊
I love the way he says warmth he’s like “warmpth” lol luv u Manny 😽😽🥰😍
The tea is. This so basic and the colour corrector is something we’ve all seen. There’s nothing universal about Red colour corrector cause they ALL work with EVERY skin tone.
can you please do a house tour
That type of egg would be called a Fabergé egg :)
I have been waiting for this to come out!! I can’t wait!! 😍
Manny I love you and your videos you are so inspiring and funny 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️
Have nothing against Nikita! I’m actually really proud of her! Must feel amazing to come out with your own brand! BUT!! Come onnnnnnn that is way to expensive for that! 🥵
I always had a crush on Manny tbh.
he looks so damn good on the 3rd and 4th photo with nikita huh you should go back to that look boy
Love ya so muuuccchhhh Manny! 😘 now if I could only get a like by you on MY comment. 😘😘😘
Manny PLEASE can we Collab I love you so much 😭❤️

But I’m small and irrelevant...
I like to watch manny’s videos and respect him i know nikkita is your friend but think the product is not that special it’s looks cheap and the egg also looks so cheap you support your friend and that’s great but this products are definitely a no!
👑👑Love Your Skin Queen👑👑
Lmao you can conquer the world 🌎
Well.. I was hoping you’d be real about the price point.
this dragon theme is perffff for Aries season!! 🔥🔥🔥 I’m an aries and I LOVE this so much! Love you too manny 😘
Definitely made him a little orange
You have no pores! Damn.
That's why people were giving her so much hate, it's kind of gimicky to charge people $105 for a mystery egg for a color corrector and face powder. I love her marketing strategy but the price is just to high not all she should analyze that most of her fans aren't as bougee as her. 😂
Yes Manny, it looks like a Faberge (fab Er jay) egg 😉
Loooove this video! And I love The white background, I can totally concentrate on your beautiful face 😍😍😍 I love Nikita’s brand whole concept I just feel the price is high af🙈
Not much into color correcting myself but you can definitely see a difference. Definitely worth trying. The powders I'm excited to try specially the pink shade. Good for Nikita on launching products that aren't common, she did something that is true to her. 🐉💜
Can you please review xobeauty?
Idk y but somehow the way u talk really soothes me
No (&I can’t emphasize this enough) mammes . .
So honest and real review!! Thanks!!! ❤❤❤❤
Damn that corrector is bomb his mustache is literally gone lmao
Empty house tour👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
undereyes looks so dry when he kept on piling it on
The word you're looking for is acoustics lol
Whaaaat!! The difference with your moustache is insane!! Very cool 😻
Oh so y’all r friends again?
The best color correctors tbh are liquid lipsticks & the fenty match shimmer sticks (the red one). I know that that one is like a red highlighter but it actually blends out very nice & the shine actually makes the skin look real underneath if you have a beard it’s like amazing
Wait... you said you were going to put it on your beard, but you put it on your mustache.. 😂 it’s ok. Still love you. I just had a chuckle ❤️💖
Congrats on your new place Manny!
Absolutely love the color of that shirt on you?
The promo tho, it was TERRIBLE
It reminds me of harry potter and the goblet of fire... Lol only one????
video starts pretty much at 4:35
After you do that finder thing I sit there and try it and fail😂😂
Of course this is going to be positive 🙄
okay but manny is looking so fit
Does anyone know of a good brightening pressed powder that has that sheen but is cheap? I want the kkw one but das expensive and so is this one lmao
It’s called acoustics huntyyyy😂❤️
I’m sorry but can we talk about how gorgeous manny actually is ... Damon Salvatore whoooo?? ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I actually watched the whole video. I want it.
Friend reviews friend : truth for the egg!?! 
I don't think so...
Love your shirt color~!
She should stick to wigs👌🏽
I’m still trying to figure out how you did that finger thing in the beginning 😂
I like this background better leave it
maybe a product for those with dark circles under their eyes or birthmarks
I love love love love manny but am i the only one forgetting that he absolutely hated the Laura mercier “glow” powder but loves her brightening powder? What’s the difference babe?
209 thumbs up and only 36 views?? YouTube are you ok?😂
Living for this
It's 8pm rn and watching you.. Icant wait too see your house 🏡
I see no damn difference!
I can barely see it  but huge difference  I like how it dries down  might try it
I also commented on RawBeautyKristi Video about this. I am positively surprised about the Dragun products 🙂 you did a great job Nikita 😘😍
Do a colab with Tayla Damir💞💞
With that colour corrector oumpa lumpas are coming to town
I get huge kid's makeup vibes from this whole launch
The under eyes are the same, but on your mustache area there is a difference! Won't be purchasing bc i just dont need it lol
MANNY!!!!! You don't seem like yourself! Is it just me? lol, you just seem a little stressed! I hope you're okay! ~ muah ~  Love you Manny!!!!!!
I wish we were friendsssss....🤪❤️
😂😂 I loooooove that damn finger!
I don’t see the blue undertone at all. Anyone else struggling?
Ngl I couldn't see any difference when the brightening powder was applied, am I the only one?
I'm not impressed!!
Are we gonna get a house tour?
I think this is a biased review since he and nikita are bfs
“You wanna work with it “quicklier” than I thought.” ....  I love your English Manny!! 😂😂
He keeps calling his mustache his beard. Lmfao I love you manny
Do another ASMR video lol
$25 for a color corrector???
Use a red liquid lip and any ol lightning powder.  Same thing.
I honestly think this is so cute 💜 I’m living for it , it’s something that’s just gonna give you that little extra something , something in you’re makeup look that’s going to make you look that much more snatched 😍 I’ve been watching other reviews of this too , & everyone who uses it looks just a little cuter than usual lol I think it’s a really cute product (the whole kit ) especially for makeup artists to have in their kit , to get their clients looking that much more snatched for whatever special occasion they’re doing 😍 my opinion tho 💜
I love it. It has trans girls so covered. I also prefer the side it’s on compared to the side without.
yall are such haters lmao y’all hype people so much and once they make big moves you all turn into haters. I’m sure the products are good, may not be 100% universal but ummm sure it works on a lot of different skin tones, her prices aren’t anything abnormal, and I’ve seen worse packaging.
Why is Nikita’s Escape The Night dress purple in the thumbnail? .-.
Pass... I hope Nikita makes her own lingerie brand tho, definitely will buy!!!
You are so cute!❤ But those products are way too overprice for a little difference!!!
I wish you would do a collaboration with Laura Lee or Jaclyn Hill again!!!
Bravo to her for taking the plunge, but the fact that it changed the color of your face is a total turn off. You can buy cheaper correctors from NYX or covergirl and not have your face looking like you are a tangerine under that makeup.
I also don’t like that it seemed to dry down instantly. It makes it harder to blend out so that it’s not so harsh prior to putting on foundation.
I’ll pass. Sorry Nikita.
Just saying.. I don’t think that it was fair for manny to do this review because he and Nikita are good friends so he’s obviously going to say good stuff about her brand and products.
It looks beautiful on the orange side looks like contour
Love love love this video 💕💕
I feel like we broke up as friends for a while and I came back and he vibe is different and I like this change so I’m subscribing again...😭 missed you Manny❤️❤️
Omgoodness those powders are just gorgeous 🤩🤩 And I really need that corrector for my sleep deprived under eyes 😵😵 Beautiful just beautiful 🥰🥰 I LIVE!! 🙌🏻
“Pierre” 🇫🇷 🤣
manny baby I love you tons, but I just don’t see very much of a difference for the hefty price tag... an okay product, but you over hyped them when there’s products that preform the same and better for much less.
On the side with the color corrector you look like you slept more.
Is it just me or am I really feeling your set up in this video?
Honestly ur right side looks way better🤷‍♀️ur left looks pinkish orangey!
WarmTHH..warMTTH @16:06 lol
Omg I thought I was crazy! I was playing with mine last night and I noticed that it gave me a lot of warmth.
It’s a “no” for me.
Me gusta😍 love you manny!!!!!!
This is so unnecessary....

“ You know No one asked for this” Lovely Ti voice
Did you shave half of your face Manny? 🤨
Did you shave half of your face Manny? 🤨
Emanuel theres such a difference when you film after pre workout and when you dont lol.
As if he's gonna say the crap sucks 🙄 he ain't got enough friends to lose her too
woaw this actually works
we have to accept that theres no such thing as universal bc people look different!!!! ):
He’s clearly going to give it a good review cause they still friends
Idk I just feel like he’s not going to say anything bad about the makeup because it’s his friend .🙄
Manny.....I love you.....BUT......u know damn well, there is so many negative reviews on this product. People come to you for honest reviews, and I haven’t even watched the whole video to know what this is gonna be about 😒stop pointing out all the positives about this nightmare product release. This crap is a rip off. Overpriced. Scam. Anyone who buys it is just a fan
That egg is kind of cool but also walks the line between cool and tacky. It looks kind of cheap to me, like those dollar tree or Target eggs. Also that corrector is obviously not universal. She'd have been better off releasing several correctors. The prices.. they're a bit high for who she is and this launch. Some skin tones looking ashy... IDK sis, it's just not it for me. I wish her the best of luck and success, and hope she releases something i can really get on board with. That said, whoever does like these products and wants them, that's super awesome and I hope they work out for them!
Looks like 2 different shades of foundation on each side. You sure you used the same foundation on both sides Manny? That one side is way lighter of a shade than the other in the spots you didn't even color correct on
Hey I think that it could be found at tj max
take a shot every time he talks about canceling out blue undertones
Manny - If you don't like me, you shouldn't watch this video. 
Me - 
leaves a hate comment and exits
manny blends in with the background lmao
The powder looks hella cheap. Like kid makeup cheap. I like Nikita but come on.
4:48 he starts makeup

Your welcome:))
For me it's the price. I think it's a good product and if you want to support a brand cool. It's a bit expensive.
NIKITADRAGUNISCANCELLEDTHEHOUSE!
On,y briefly angelic
4 adds in a video or 20 mnts and no one cares ? Lol
Oh no 😳 yeah - I'll pass
He repeats himself alot😂 still love him tho
ur beard is cancelled the house honey!
I don't about anyone else, but I couldn't really tell a difference.
Pierre 😫😂😂😂
Best check that price point...
I wish that you would bring us in for a closer look. Cant really tell what it does from so far away.
So many haters here. Lmao
Manny clearly stated that him being friends with Nikita isn’t going to have any impact on his review. People are still going to come at him with “they are friends his opinions are biased” but you can clearly see the difference between the two sides in the video. So go ahead and take that into consideration before you start leaving comments like that. 
Love watching your videos manny ! Love the bloopers you have now :)
Lmao the packaging looks very cheap so does the egg and she had the nerve to overprice her avg. products.
Manny ! why on concealed side u start from mustache place ( most of product goes there) and other side u start from cheek and once u have less product u go to mustache and dab it so hard ...clearly  to show that concealed area is better, i had high hopes for ur review especially u said it doesnt matter that ure Nikita friend and you will be honest but what u do in front of cam says otherwise .... i like nikita and You but please stop playing us.
Review tarte face tape 🙏🏼
$25 for that? thats the size of a regualr liquid lipstick girl  ill stick to my la girl corrector 😬
That egg better be discounted after Easter
Manny! Baaaaby, you do not need that much corrector under your eye considering you don't have anything to actually correct. If you wanted to do it just so we could see the product, just 1 dot would have been enough
Only half of ur face is awake lol😂
Ok I can honestly say $105 is wayyyyyy too expensive and I can say this having purchased your line at Christmas time for my daughter. A whole eyeshadow palette , highlighter palette and 3 lip products for $117 I feel like the packaging was more detailed than this and I also feel like yours was more for the dollar I felt like she would have many ways she could be creative this is just insanely expensive. If anyone really wanted to they could just find something similar in the less expensive brands.
Am I the only one that doesn't see a difference between his two sides? Friends will always hype up their products.
DIY egg 10 bucks, nikita dragon's egg 100 bucks, see the difference?
Omg 🤪it looks like a soft pinky shade.
So you will use the corrector forever now? Because the side without is sooooooo much worse? 😂
18:46 😂💜
Who the hell would buy that egg? 🤣
Yo that shoulder jive at 2:02 was everything
I missed the memo that said “warmer is the new word for Orange” !!! 👎
I still need the Life's a Drag Palette!!!! 😫😭
i wish to see a review on removing the makeup after a long day, i think it stains on the skin its so effing orange..
Hey it’s the girl you met at the hotel how r u doing dood:)
Love you soo much ❤️❤️
I could definitely tell a difference! I personally think your side with the corrector made you look much more awake and alive. That being said, I personally just think it’s too expensive as a girl on a budget. The LA Girl color corrector works too. But if I didn’t have to be on a budget I’d totally get it just because for my dark af bags under my eyes just to support Nikita ❤️
I love this!!! So sick niNg
Uh one shade and hella pricey 😐.
House tour??!
Manny looks like he’s falling apart
As much as you're "living" and its a "hit", you probably won't be using either in a years time, but we'll see.
Эх Мэни, надо тебе на "Математику цвета" к Людмиле Таракановой.
His under eye looks the exact same bruh
An eyeshadow palette inside the egg or even lippies would've been way more interesting. Issa HELL NAW for me.
Oooohh okay she TRIPPIN TRIPPIN
You are so silly... 🙃 😂 😊 Love you!
I think that you are thinking of a Faberge egg
I love and support Nikita all the way but I wouldn’t use any of those products. I hope there’s people out there that will. I find the color corrector too expensive.
Manny, it reminds me of the big blue egg and it had like the boxes of makeup inside!!!
The bloopers killed me Pierre !!!!
15:41 😂💀
I do not understand why you say you're Nikita's friend, she made a video a month ago using makeup from her ex beaty guru friends and you appear in it.
Half the comments are ppl saying Nikita brand is not good like its his opinion not yours
Well this is awkward as Obama judging Trump's Orange wig...haha
Why would you make your first product colour correctors....
LOVE IT!!! 😍
My face and ..... Uhuh Manny😂😂
The color corrector honestly made you look a little more life like and have a more healthy glow!
I think people don't understand the actual cost of running a business and making products. She's not a large company that can mass produce so yeah it's going to be more expensive. I get it's probably over some people's budget but at the end of the day it's makeup and if it's not for you then you don't need to buy it.
That egg reminded me of the dragon tale egg
Ty for the great video
Omg i love you ❤️😭
People can charge whatever they think their product is worth. Pricing strategy is aimed towards  a certain class of clientele, she's obviously not trying to compare her product to the cheaper market.
Your my favorite
The corrector is the shade of cheeto dust
I wouldn't get any of this too expensive and honestly it doesn't look that good to me at all
it really works on ur upper lip!!!! wow
i see no difference except the left side of your face looks more orange
Mannnnyyyyyy don’t let her make you lie to us
Over priced and not worth it. I can get better results from the drug store. And for the price of 1 product.
so i've never liked you and i have never followed you on any of your social medias (but at the same time i haven't send hate to you, i was like "i don't know him and i don't want to know") BUT i just watched a few of your videos and um you're like great and how could i live without watching you???
I don't see any difference between, yes one it's more warm, but that's all, a bit pricey there are products that do the same and for more than half of the price. I think she should have come up with other products idk
why does he lowkey lookin like one of the dolan twins at 3:35
She created products for herself basically, and called them universal.. smh
Hes doing it again. Bias review for a friend. Not good many. Ur faking it as usual.
Can’t even tell you have anything on. Looks cheap and way to expensive
Finally something to hide the remnants of my PCOS. I have your same mustache and chin hair thanks to my wonderful crazy hormones that keep telling my brain that I'm a boy. I'll def use that EGG. Thank you for reviewing. Keep smiling beauty.
Your hair looks like chicken feathers lmao
U are my crush 😭
all I hear is "warm" "warm" "warm" omw. 😂
Tbh, i like your skin♥
You look absolutely no different to how you normally would. This boring launch will never be exciting 😂😂😂
Am I the only one that thinks that both sides look exactly the same? I don't see a difference... 🤔
I love the corrected side better looks full coverage, and omg Ms. Dragun made products for beauties like herself she’s a trans woman y’all. Her line will be a definition of herself and what she loves.
Could you do a tutorial with out your t-shirt. You're hot.
I feel like you need to do another video.  A 2.0 version of the product. Only because it looked like a bunch was used, maybe with this product less is more...
Bro manny is so funny
Which primer do you use? I have some serious smile line and hate when they crack. Currently using fenty foundation with too faced setting spray
Bruuh I see no difference
I need someone w bad bad bags to try this product
U look like u got beat up
the color corrector seems fine too me. i don’t understand why everyone hates, just don’t buy it, period.
As much as I wish I could support her brand, those prices though. Like I just can’t justify spending that much.
Not here for it... I still see the mustache with the color corrector on and the prices and cheesy plastic egg. Nahhhhh.....
OKAYyyy manny I see you with the gains.
2:10 into this video and I already know I’ll be a fan for life! It is hella fun here!
Para mí ambos lados de la cara se ven iguales.
I’m excited to see the new place
I typed “Dragun Beauty review” into YouTube. No one is saying good things about it... The packaging looks cheap and that egg looks like blingy styrofoam??? Yikes Nikita 😬😬
Love the color corrector on you !
I actually like the side without the corrector
I don’t care for her makeup, but I want that egg! Haha it’s gorgeous!
GEEZ WHY IS MANNY SO FABULOUS
Love the egg idea, hate the actual packaging because it looks cheap but I totally see a difference and love that it dries down
Nice review 😍
Not worth the priceeee..
I like your side without the corrector, the one with the corrector you look straight up orange.  On the non corrector side you have a beautiful translucence, having a blueish-pale translucent skin is something all asian beauty aims for and I don't get why you'd prefer Cheeto orange with this opaque weird cast. This was meant to cover 5 oclock shadow apparently but if people just put it around their beard theyll be orange just there. I don't like Nikita at all but I'm not biased and I think that product is bad, at least on you. Maybe it works better for people with darker skin like Nikita. You keep saying blue undertone blue undertone, but under the other eye you're straight up red...
I do see a difference, I don’t really care for color correct.. I think she should have come up with like a clothing line
I’m preety sure he’s going to love it because there friends just saying, u look orange 🍊
i watched this video to see how little views it has lol
Most boring product release ever. Way over priced, she needs to get a grip. Colour pop sells correctors for like 6$ and there’s no way that powder is universal
So funny manny. 🤣  I saw the difference
what foundation did you use in this?? 💖
It looks like the egg from dragon tales
20 minutes of manny trying to hype up nikkitas half ass brand, and him also saying the same thing for 20 min. God damn ik she your friend but it cant be 99% all good
How are those powders going to work for darker skin tones. It already looks so ashy on everyone else.
7:34 pm for me how ironic
I see no difference. Color corrector is a scam.
Someone needs to come out with a perfume line .
this is so bias!!!!! how come Manny didn’t mention the obvious outrageous prices for the things from her brand, but he does for every other review? If something is overpriced and almost always gives his opinion on it. He didn’t with this review. Also, did anyone else notice how many times he said “truthfully”, “honestly” in this video? Which 100% tells me this was not a 100% honest review. That was so disappointing.
3:35 Manny looks hot there!
The packaging literally looks so cheap. The components look like elf’s components just with some basic decal. Especially that powder...girllll how much product do you get?? Thank you, next.
I'm thinking this should be in Clair's and you are trying so hard and repeating yourself
Hello Pierre!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Lmao nikita why?
I dont mind the warmth in the side where you put the corrector. Your skin looks flawless. Looks like a natural contorted look.
Thank u, next - ariana
Manny is so pretttttyyyyy
Anybody else notice he repeated himself on 4:50 before he put the corrector on & again after it put it on .... Sorry but honest opinion the product it self is too pricey🤷‍♀️
the egg was all opening when he took it out the box ...reminded me of a plastic cheap Easter egg lol
Many, porque te pusiste otro polvo antes que ese? Así mezclas y no se ve al 100% el producto. Y te pusiste más base del lado naranja. Te amo pero eso se vio y no me gusto mucho. Besos enormes chico 😘
Definitely a hard pass for me. The packaging looks cheap (kind of looks like kids makeup), universal just scares me, the price point is ridiculous, and again the price point is ridiculous, also....$50 for an egg that looks like it is wrapped in blue aluminum foil?! Yeah, definitely pass. Not shading Nikita in anyway, I am glad she is expanding her brand and doing a collection of things we don't see much of in the beauty realm anymore. I would have considered purchasing but, again......that price!
why does it look like he already had concealer on the side he used her color corrector 🧐
19:42 😂😂
The prices are a bit excessive...
Busted the house
Liquid lipstick consistency yikes
Your editing is on point just hilarious.
I think the reviews you’d did on hush make up did way better than this make up from her... no shade tho
the corrector side is definitely more warm and it did cover the blue very well but i also feel like the corrector side made the whole side of his face a lot more orange. no shade, it’s just what i noticed and it seems like the corrector did make the foundation more orange 🤷🏼‍♀️
I don’t think they work.
Can it be used as a liquid lipstick tho? Haha just wondering. Probably would've been better like that. With A LOT of shade
That egg looks plastic as guck I can get that egg at the 99¢ store get the la cover girl concealer and the powder and then guess what I have my own Nikita product and I only wanted like $20 the most
Really looks sooo amazing
This video is horribly edited, it is so clearly sped up and with so many jump cuts. I actually had to turn it off because Manny sounds like a robot through my entertainment system. It's so bad.
Looks like a cheap version of a hatchimal😂😂😂
Don’t see a difference
That’s one expensive plástico huevo!
150 dollars for a Dollar Tree easter egg and some ashy looking powders. Nah Ill pass. It looks like a Hatchimal
If Nikita made a pallete with the Dragon Egg and the colors inside of it, it would be good af! She should make it and call it Dragonify Pallete or The Dragon's Pallete
Manny who?
You Guys be complaining about the price and most of you guys pay for like eye shadows for $50 and you can’t pay 55 for 2 products
Kinda wish  he did his whole beard
People drag wayyyyy too much. Don’t y’all got anything better to do with y’all’s life?!? Manny is great and I 100% believe that.
4:45 application
Wow that color shirt on you is so nice
The hate is real on these comments 🙄
mi corazon!!!!!!!
nice but the prices are ridiculous.
She looking slimmer
I dont think it’s necessary for that price. There are other brands thats more cheaper and works fine.
Way over priced yikes kind of disappointing to see :/
Yeah i think its over price..
Manny is super nice
The egg reminds me of game of thrones lol
Personally not into it. She could have done something else or had better prices. It’s definitely NOT universal. I would t even know she came out with anything if there weren’t videos because all these other launches have been better quality and better priced.
I love sea turtles literally have a turtle tattoo
Lol is this the concealer what Donald trump uses 😂
You’re as white as you can be what do you mean lighter than you 😂😂
It looks great.
Im confused. R ya friends or no
i think it's not worth the price i meeeaaann only 2 products and nothing special except the egg... That's a huge no for me...
As a MUA I want to say that color corrector shade is universal. This is the shade I used on all my clients under their eyes of all skin tones. Just wanted to say that because in the comments a lot are saying it’s not.
Dragun he’s a scam artist
Wow it really works lol
If friends are reviewing friends products it's a given that they won't be bashing on their product/s....this video is more for PROMOTING the product...just my opinion.
Manny “You’re perfect. You’re beautiful. You look like Linda Evangelista. You’re a model.” That egg...Not so much. And for $105 it better turn itself into an omelette or eggs Benedict.
Being of a much darker skin color then Nikita and yourself. The universal concealer didn’t work for me. However, I guess results vary with different skin tones. And skin combinations. It’s not skin oily friendly.
I see no difference between the color corrector an the other side of your face besides you looking orange asf
Is that a pink morphe sponge?
UMMMM 25 DOLLARS for a orange color corrector that is the exact same as the 4 DOLLARS LA girl orange color corrector AND to top it off the packaging/container is cheap not even a lil boujeee ????????
She shouldve capitalized off of her Victorias Secret video and made her own lingerie line that is inclusive towards transgender women or something instead of releasing a beauty line thats been over done and then make it over priced. Just my opinion.
Packaging looks like colour pop lol
Lmao that color corrector better make all my old skeletons disappear if my ass will be paying $25 for it.
I wanted to see you do the one side of your whole bottom bearddddd!
Why does Manny give me such bad vibes?! He just seems so shady or something!
I can't be the only one it looks like a giant avocado to
I am passing on these products. I personally think there over priced. I don’t see a difference. I am not seeing the difference on each side like your saying.
Looks Ashy
Hunny you’re looking skinny!
I can tell the difference!
Oh Hell naaa
unless you are a guy it's a pass
Someone needs to do a full face using only color correctors
But why would you need the egg? Like whats the purpose
“I dOnno” aww
“Ah we Pierre”
Have you noticed that your views have gone down! Wtfff crazyyy
That’s so expensive
Next time use a different beauty blender for your foundation and that warmth won’t happen
Warm...👀 You mean orange right?
I thought i was going to be in the 'this is not worth it ' team. But that powder looks great!
When I’m having a bad day... is it bad that I look for your videos not because I need some beauty advice but because you make
Me die laughing? ❤️ “fereroche egg” 😂😂😂 I love you ...PS I watch them for beauty advice too though 😉
Universal? More like Nikita didn’t want to make more
100% PASS
Nikita sucks :)
WTF SPONG IS THIS SIS 😘👀👀👀👀👀👀
The negative comments are pretty annoying lol, but to me; I saw a huge difference! I’m excited because I have horrible dark under eyes! These products look amazing. I will agree that the packaging is nothing special. Reminds me of Colourpop. If you’re going to charge that price it should definitely reflect on the packaging as well. Don’t be charging $50 something dollars for some Colourpop packaging 😂😂. BUT the products themselves look like they perform very well. You can literally see it for yourself. The powders look like they gave a filter to your face. So I’ll be buying both, but I hope she hears us about the packaging. I feel like I could find it in Claire’s or something lol.
This video makes me want to buy the color corrector bc it is so clear how great it is and I don’t even need it
What blue undertone
Ok not hate but i like the Color correct but I don’t think it will work on light skin cuz it’s to deep but the powders I think only will work for light skin and I like the idea of it working for every skin tone but I don’t think that will work I wish she made a green and yellow and pink with it and a deeper powder or even a light medium deep but I like how she didn’t do a matt lip and an eyeshadow palette like most that she came out with different products but I do think the packaging is kind of like little kid makeup but it should be about what in it and not out side just my thought
Not hating but kind of looks... childish? Hey, if it works, it works but I’d rather spend 5$ on la girl than 25$
The packaging looks so cheap and tacky... She couldve made it look sooo much better and the heart shaped powders, no boo boo 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️. Its like a kids make up vibe lmao. Im mot trying to be mean and I know she probably put hrs in to this shit but packaging does matter, if it didn't then people wouldn't put that extra effort into making it look just as bomb as it performs.
The dancing with the indexfingers has me dead😂😂😂😂
Love it Manny
Test bhad bhabie makeup xo
7:05 i died.15:34
I thought it worked well too, and the powders seem to be reliable. I did see the difference.
Yessss
Hola mi bebe Manny. Nikita Dragun no es simpatico. Ella es muy mal. Es necesito que tú tienes más amigas que son simpático. Entonces tu vida voy a estar más feliz. 😘💋💋💋
There's not a big difference which in conclusion means, not worth it. I can get 4 colour correctors for $10 and I can use a light shear eye shadow under my eyes.
Biased review obviously but I can appreciate a review. Hard pass for me. The price is not right and who color corrects these days. It’s an extra step and there are other better options. The powder was something I was considering but I see no difference in this video.
plz send me some makeup!!!!!!!
How tf he do that finger thingy tho?....
I NEED IT
Trying to hard to save that egg I see
I just don’t understand. I would’ve expected an extra asf eyeshadow pallette with amazing colors maybe some sickening concealer and stuff like that. But an universal color corrector and a little bit of powder? first of all universal would mean it corrects warm (red, orange) AND cool tones, it’s fucking orange so how is it universal if u can’t correct redness or let’s say sensitive skin. 
THAT IS NOT UNIVERSAL. 
maybe I’m just dumb but I don’t get the point, that is not a collection in my opinion, it’s just something what everyone sells, u can get all this stuff at primark for probably 15$ in total.
I’m shook that she made a fuckin hype about this.
This seems great for Trans people or drag queens but what about real women in everyday makeup? A little much👎🏻
Your voice stays almost monotone throughout the whole video, you seem unhappy tbh (not abt the product or anything just in general) (is he always like this tho I dunno bc I don’t watch his videos)
I'd buy clothes and her own line of wigs from Nikita but not make up.
The Martiaaaaaaaaaaaans!
Honey, I can make a DIY Easter egg in my home that also less than paying 100$ for it.
Am I the only one that couldn’t see much of a difference?
Conquer me !
I’m more interested in the egg lol. I’m proud of mama dragun though. She’s come so far! She will always have my respect, but I’ll pass on this release because realistically I won’t use it and I own enough stuff that I haven’t used yet lol.
pierre 😂
I can’t wait to get my hands on this!!! I am a single mama and I work two jobs while going to school, so I ALWAYS have dark circles!! So I hope this will help me hide those.
You’re such a cutie
So basically this is for when I need to cover my beard. Which I really hope is never... Um, not buying.
Why does Manny look like he's a recovering addict?
That’s ur mustache not your beard
It’s $105 with the blinged egg. It’s $55 for the regular egg set. If you want a blinged out Set you would have to pay an additional $50. 🙂 Hopefully, I understood well. Okay, cheers everyone. 🙂
Honestly don't see a difference and it's way, way over priced just looks like something from Claire's, not talking shit just my honest opinion
Are we all just gonna ignore that ad with the text messages between the baby sitter and the mom??? 👀
Te amo Manny
overpriced
I do think this product worked, and I do think it would be great for a very specific group of people. Lots of people do not color correct, I personally don’t. I’m sure I could benefit from it but I feel like it’s just too much of an extra step. This is a very niche product, almost like it’s for professional makeup artists only? Great concept but not sure this reaches many people. 🍀
An orange colour corrector that corrects but warms up the undertone 😱😱
Sorry no hate, I just found it funny that manny was pointing out such obvious things that I’m sure all correctors do?
Nikita is not a woman lol
HARD PASS
I can see a big difference in the stash area
Nikita did too much for that price it’s not worth it.....
none of her friends are giving honest reviews how sad
As a trans female myself. I know correcting is something you can do in the beginning when you’re going through transition. But it’s also not realistic to have layers of product on a biologically male face. It makes things look more obvious and Cakey. I thought about buying it for a split second to be a supportive sis. But I personally can’t see myself using it now feeling comfortable wearing so many layers. I literally just throw on concealer and call it a day.
Sorry but I think this makeup is way to much $$$ and don't like nice at all ... it really makes me  think of $1 store just looking at it
Cuteeeee
I feel it looks ok on you but it’s not stunning for the price especially when you have to use different colors to correct different skin types and tones. It’s clearly made for Nikita’s skin tone and is not really universal. Color Correction is part of the special effects industry so there’s so many cheaper options that would work better for people who don’t look like Nikita no offense.
you’re so awkward
Because the color corrector covered the blue under your eyes better than just the concealer side, you check bone on that side looks higher making that side of your face look slimmer...and who doesn't like to look slimmer?
omg okay manny losing weight- go off.
I’m digging this shirt color
I'm sure the products are great but an extra $50..for an egg..At least make it LOOK like a faberge egg T-T
Fabrege egg!
You’re still here
Corrects blue . . . I don't have a beard or a mustache so?? Not exactly universal. I mean, maybe if you're trans. Which I guess that is who she markets to more, so that's fine. She just needs to not rely so heavily upon the word "universal".
Nice video!
That nose whistle at 16:00 tho
This looks like the kid makeup I buy for my daughter 😬😬😬😬
DASSSSSSS EXPENSIVE😟
I’m confused as to why it’s more warm on the perimeter of your face if you didn’t use the color corrector in that area????
Idk. Cuz I feel like doing stuff like making a brand like this is really hard and she is just trying it out and will learn and improve from her first launch. She's not gana know what we like. It's better to launch something simple first
🙂
That’s pretttty pricey chikita Nikita
Lmao tell me y bishhh I don’t see no damm difference on the dam concealer u don’t even have dark circles 😂😫😫😫ur don’t need that shhh manny with ur handsome ass r u trying to sell us cuz it’s ur friend ? Lol I didn’t see shhh who else noticed ?
Honestly on camera I saw no difference between the sides. Even if this stuff worked (which it's supposed to since you're paying for it) you can use LA Girl for less than $3. Why should anyone knock themselves out to buy this? Also powder is powder. I lost all interest in that powder when Nikita said that it would "change your facial structure". No. Plastic surgery is the only thing that can do that. Right off the bat she's way off with her claims and that is a sign that her stuff isn't all that remarkable.
It reminds me of la girl color corrector and that’s like $6 no shade just saying!
It’s 7:33 for me
Not feeling it
Quicklier......lol
6:33 Donald Trump is s h a k i n g
🙄
💜💜
If you’re not going to be fully honest then what was the point of making this video?
Not impressed. The package looks cheap. The product looks dry and cheap.I think it’s overpriced. What  is up with the Egg, what do you do with it after you remove the products? Great review but I’m just not impressed with this brand. I’ll pass !
You look orange AF 🍊
She’s trying to make her brand look hella  bougie with that expensive price. Honestly she should of came with something else... a lipstick or maybe an eyeshadow. Plus she says her brand is for “transgender people, and all people” not that I have anything against transgender people, but the phrase sounds weird, and let’s not forget the long names for each product... meh... I give it a pass... but who am I? Who am I girl? I’m nobody...
We all know it’s bad I don’t trust manny anymore just because there friends haha the reviews were horrible
I swear I see so many comments and videos hating on manny and I’ve watched every single one but like anytime I watch his videos I like him and think he’s funny it’s hard to jump on the hate train when u genuinely enjoy someone
she tried to b different & I give her props but not a lot of people use color correctors & even if they did it’s highly overpriced , sorry but I’m going to pass
did he have a double eyelid surgery? it looks weird
Tbh could just be cause the camera and in real life looks different but not much of a difference like very verrrryyyy small difference . Like I’m being too nice literally no difference I can still see the undertone on ur mustache and u don’t have it that bad on ur under eye
All of it looks like something you’d find when you’re 20 looking at memories from 5th grade. And lmao. The best she can? Looks like target gonna be selling a lot of eggs
I think nakita could've come out w something better like a lip and the powders bc not everyone needs color corrector and i heard the bedazzled easter egg was 50$ extra 😮😮 whaaattttt? Nah it's a pass for me.. hard pass.. but congrats to her!
Irrriiiissss-wharrrriiiirrriisssss
But... (I don’t know so please don’t come for me) What I saw in the video was that nikkta put the corrector on the guy’s dark circles and went immediately with the powder and it seemed to « transform » into his skin tone. Isn’t it how it’s supposed to work ?
That orange thingy looks like it’s made for her scan tone
Mas videos en español. Please 🥺🙏
Been using orange around the blueish parts on my face for years so to me the egg looks MEGA cheap and tacky and the products are nothing new at all.
❤️❤️❤️
Amoooooooo el clásico “irrriss guarriiirriiiis” 🥰
It sucks that everyone is being so negative about this product saying it won’t work even tho they haven’t tried it. Things are evolving everyday and for everyone constantly being so negative is so sad! I feel like, unless you’re out here trying to produce something better then this, who are you to judge someone working their ass off to make you feel pretty
I wish Mama Dragun would’ve given PR to ppl other than her crew. I love Mama Dragun, but y’all are doing her a disservice gassing her up like this! It’s 2019,  can we rock the boat a little harder vs scamming us for our coins? Damn sis! I LIVEEE for Nikita, but damn, damn, damn! HARD PASS
Kbir et jayah
So who else thought they weren’t friends and was shocked that he did this video
Anyone else here just to see him lie for 20 min straight?
manny please, look how orange you look girl, it looks orange to me, its a fail
Manny trying to make his video longer by repeating himself for 20mins straight
If she’s targeting transgender users why wouldn’t she make it cheaper???? Some trans people can’t afford this lol
I personally completely understand why she came out with those products first! She’s embracing her trans community and this will probably change the makeup game for them! Even though I am going to pass on this, I’m excited to see what she comes out with in the future :)
But why so expensive for her first launch? LA Girl has a great color corrector for $3. The price is disappointing. I do wish her success though, but personally, I won’t be buying it.. or the egg 😆😘
The products are way to overpriced and the egg is completely unnecessary. That's what really needed to be said.
ديسكاستنق
I come and check on this channel every so often to see if they're still even bothering. Seems like they are. It's pathetic at this point
Zamn zaddy
Who tf would spend 50 dollars on that egg...? What’s the use? Lol what
I’m extremely pale and for me the color corrector was way too dark and the powders were too. They didn’t brighten my under eyes at all. I use a white powder.
Nice video
Ugh! She needs to fire her marketing team.  1st that horrible promo video and then this horrible packaging.  Looks cheap as hell and she's charging luxury price.
I think ima pass.......
I’m with the masses and agree that the price point is way over. The egg looks cute but again , the price mark is over. Manny tried, but over reached on his review. Still love manny .
Oh shut up manuela with your expensive nikkito egg 🍳! Is just too expensive! 👎👎👎
I think it is really cool that it made your mustache hair less visible because my upper lip always looks dark even with makeup and I hate that
bias
Cheeeeeaaaap cheapcheapcheap you’re biased considering you’re friends with her, you can say you’re not but... we all know her products are pure garbage
ZOOM ZOOM
It went from Pumpkin to Ash. As a woman, it's not for me. I am ultra pale and use rose or yellow. Just a spf primer, foundation, powder gal. Idk.... I could see this working for the Queens of the universe though. Sidenote, that big egg ain't worth all that extra coin. Unless, you are a Dragun fanatic, next...... 😔
yuck.
this and larlaleech getting more views than grav3yardgirl is disturbing.
Biased.
How much she asking is pretty out there..and a $100 for the egg. Like wtf .let me go buy a egg at use that smh
i think the products DEFINITELY show results, and I love the way that the corrector looked liked it dried down. I can already tell that is going to work out great for my combination skin, BUT. I honestly think there are cheaper alternatives out there that work the same way. Works great, but break down, you can probably get some great dupes for less
Big pass bc it’s the two most useless products. I’d never use them, lol.
I see orange and can't get over is Donald Trump using this?
Thought y’all weren’t friends?
No
anyone else clock the dragun beauty phone case?? sorry but I can’t take this review seriously coming from someone so close to her
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
I don’t think anyone will buy that it’s way too expensive and nonsense
Y este huevo es caro para dos cosas putas too moch jeje
It’s going to be a hard pass!!!!! For me
I’m not understanding the point for charging extra to get the egg.
Makeup is getting ridiculous.....
Great video! Would love to try!
Do you remember when nikta shot you with a gun leave in the comment if you know were thats from
Hi I’m new here.. too cute and funny.. so your Mexican I think not sure that’s sooo cool you go..
BIG NO 👎 nothing special about it and you manny make look like its the shiit of course shes ur friend nd she PR YOU THE DINO EGG
Orange cancels blue.  Red cancels green.  Yellow cancels purple.
Orange
6:35 Annoying Orange was my childhood lmao
Easter egg......
Love you Manny ❤
Can you just marry me ! 💕 like just marry me 💕 be my man 😍  @mannymua
It's a hard pass for me, realistically color theory wise, universal shade wouldn't make sense.  And $25 for a average seeming product 🤷🏽‍♀️ I like seeing beauty creators to make their own products but this is a miss unfortunately.
Did Nikita make her own video about this?
I can’t wait to get my hands on those powders ugh
peroooo your voice  lol I like the white wall
Manny what shade are you wearing on your eyes...love💕
def be purchasing this color corrector & LOVE your honesty w your first impression vids <3 do you think you'll actually use the color corrector on a daily basis ?
I won't be buying these prices are a little much .
A Ferrero Roche egg! 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
16:00 the nose whistle lol
These products and egg are such a stupid concept omg. Expensive and cheap egg?.... Wtf hahaha
The color makes him look like a freezing cheeto
Cool egg, boring products
Like die
What's the point of a color correct when you're basically just trading one color you need to cover to another. So now instead of covering the blue with your foundation you're covering orange. What's the point? Why not just use foundation to begin with...
Please do the alphabetical make up challenge!!!
🐍🐍🐍
🐍🐍🐍🐍
It’s a Hatchimal egg
Literally went on my break early at work so I could watch this video ❤️❤️❤️
Your the absolute bestesttt ♥️♥️♥️ watching your vid while eating hot Cheetos 😋
You can put the color corrector then conceal over it with concealer. After that you can put the foundation. Hope this helps! 😊
A couple of videos ago in your Spanish video you mention El Paso Texas and I’m so happy you know what my city is😭♥️ come visit soon 🥰🥰
I am liviiinnggg for all of your intros, they make me die. Love you Manny😘
manny the whole video: THIS IS THE SIDE WITH COLOR CORRECTOR AND THIS IS THE SIDE WITHOUT!
I saw that title change 🧐🧐
He was feeling himself 😂😂❤️
Omg manny you keep repeating yourself so much!! Trying to make the video longer for only 2 products?
Gonna pass as Revolution have all the colours for correcting £4 bucks but the packaging is nice 👍
Oof i want the colour correcter to try 😫
That's a mustache, huntea
What team allowed this launch to happen..
Sorry but NO this Hobby Lobby Easter egg that has some glitter on it doesn’t come close to a faberge egg!
YOU ARE ADORABLE ! I HOPE YOU LOVE ME SAME AS I LOVE YOU 😉😉😉☺☺☺☺😃😃😃😃😆😆😆😆😆😆😅😅😅❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lmao her “Launch” is horrible. It looks like u rubbed baby diarrhea on your face. And then the highlights look like colored sidewalk chalk
I’m watching at 7:30 haha
Like i would expect the egg to come with as packaging cause the egg ties it all together
Discasting
Makeup is getting ridiculous......
I love you manny you are AMAZING
I always enjoy your videos manny, me encanta tus reseñas 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
That finishing powder looks good!
honestly can still see the blue tones from your stache buuut wutevvahh
You need mr.kate to do a makeover again
Home tour of your new Place Mi Amor!! Please!!
I love ya but I need to learn to NOT watch your videos around my family in the living room😂😂😂🤷🏻‍♀️
I could totes hear your nose whistling lol
❤️❤️❤️ I love her but it’s not for me
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍



Love how real you are
many fala muito rapido
I can tell above your lip but not under your eye.
No doubt that color corrector looks pretty legit. I’d love to try it, but it’s a bit pricey. Unsure if it’s worth it or if a lower priced corrector could do the same..
Nobody thinks that it wont correct.... i mean its a color corrector. But there are other amazing color correctors out there for WAYYYYYYYY cheaper... like sis... no.
Too bad we girls don’t have beards🤷🏻‍♀️
🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉
🥚 🍳 eggs
Just my opinion. Just because you’re a “beauty guru” doesn’t mean you have to have a makeup line. I feel like the people who are making makeup in 2019 just care about stamping their name on a product and making a quick buck. There’s no passion anymore. Nikita should have did a cool lingerie line instead of makeup.
Get a peachy corrector from Bobbi brown. They’re amazing and you can get one for your skin tone. One color for all shades does NOT work. Also, it won’t make your face look warmer  because it will actually fit your skin tone :)
Ima pass.
I LOVE that under eye brightening powder!! Definitely need to purchase that! ♡♡ It gives you a gorgeous GLOW..a glow from within! ♡♡ love you manny❤
It's 03/20 at 6:30 pm. Happy First Day of Spring
I'm living for the picture of Nikita in the thumbnail from Escape The Night.
0:05 yassss the comeback!!!!
I’m sorrry it ris what it rís hahaha, I find myself saying that so often now!,  and I love the whole warm side it looks nice on you!! But then again everything does 💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️
Omg! Again with the wormy finger waves lol! 😂😂😂
love you manny!!💗💗 pass on this tho
Not worth it when more affordable products do a better job
I think the eyes look pretty much the same but the mustache area is definitely different
You cant be serious, Nikita. 

One size fits all skin tones? Lol. That's absurd. Color theory tells me that isn't possible.
I love you!!!!! I want to buy her collection, maybe once I get more money... support the ones you believe in & I believe in her!!
OMG 7:36
💙💕
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
ERES WHAT ERES
Hey! Wheres your shirt from? This color is great! I think the make up came out great. Looks nice :) Oh! Are you going to be doing a house tour when ready?
Um would you be so kind and just post me a free sample with the egg please  you know then I'll see cuz I'm broke👍.  








Thank you for your time
💰🔫💸🎃🃏🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Pinche egg! 💜🥚
👌😂😂❤️🤗😘😘😍😍😍❤️💓💓💓🤦💫💫💫💛💄💄💄
Please do a skincare video 🙏🏻😩 we need to know what you've been doing for it ♥️
Your skin is soooo good rn I'm living 😍 Masha Allah 🙏🏻💕 And I'm hoping that your new background will be sickening 🔥
I was litterly just thinking is he going to finger dance again 🤣💀 #talent 💃💃
Did anyone else giggle when he kept calling his mustache a beard? Lol love you manny!💙
Congrats on your new place Manny!! Love u bitchhhhhhhhhh
It was 7:30 at night for you and it’s currently 7:28 at night here 🤣💗
Ok only I started watching video and when you said “I will give my honest opinion “ I was like ok whatever . But as soon I saw you use the color corrector omg I can definitely see the difference
I can see how these products would work well for boys in makeup and was probably made with that in mind.
No shade but i would've rather had Nikita come out with something besides a corrector..I mean I know corrector is a big thing for her because it's something she needs and stands by...but it's not something for everyone..if u r gonna come out with a brand u should start out by introducing a product u know everyone uses..
I wish you weren't so shady...i like u but I don't
BEUH IS LIYERALLY EXACTLY 7:30
She's fricken high thinking that color is universal. Omg so dumb
Peep j* sponge thoo 👀👀👀
sickening
You don't have too but you should😝 you need to sound cloud that 😝🙌🙌🙌🎤🎵🎶🎶🎻🎹🎷🎺🎸
It’s 7:30 when I’m watching this 😂😂😂😂😂
Boring !!
Yawn
Better if the egg stays closed.
Nah,nothing special for these products.u can get color corrector that’s looks great for less. I’ll stick with  hourglass for finishing powder and the egg...c’mon.l, its almost Easter,there are eggs everywhere and decorate yourself.
Okay HOLD UP there’s no way your using Laura Mercier GLOW setting powder like the caption says hahaha YOU HATE THAT SHIZ MANNY 🗣⁉️
I really feel like you were the perfect person to review these products because you actually have the five o’clock shadow
it would have been more helpful to get a close up on both sides. From that distance I can't see any difference after you put the foundation.
I love that color shirt on you! Gorgeous!
😂😆🤣 Just tried, I can NOT do that finger thing! Haha 😆😂🤣
no disrespect, but a color corrector should be applied lightly & blended to the point of not being able to see it. this is a huge misconception in correction. a heavy application only makes it harder to cover & gives a cakey appearance.
That egg reminds me of Harry Potter 😆
And I see the warmth
Yea I can see the mustache area it is less visible on the correcter side
I love how honest Manny is in his videos. He’s not rude or anything he’s very respectful towards everything! Such a humble man ❤️ LOVE YOU MANNY! Can’t wait until you come out with your own makeup brand 😍 I’m rooting for you baby!
QUEEEEENNNNNNN loll
I LOVE YOU MANNY  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You honestly can see the difference!
💜💜💜
why the hell is the egg 50 dollars more for the bejeweled one wtf
only makeup artist understand how amazing this product is!
huge pass
Cutie
Did you guys see that blue undertone disappear ? 🙄😂
I hope your wiggly finger becomes a permanent part of your intro 😂 Love you!
Ahhh I love you so much, makes my day watching your videos ❤️❤️
Omy word this was awsome just like you! Also yes i love that finger ❤
I’m super excited for Nikita and everything she stands for but I won’t be purchasing these..I honestly have no use for these products.  I am in love with that blinged out egg though!!🥚🤩✨  Thank you for reviewing these for us!!  Love you, Manny!!💖😘 xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo 
🌙🌙
Congratulations on your new home, babe!!🎉🎊🏡
Say "warmth" one more time Manny.
You have such a THOUSAND WATT smile Manny 😁 BEAUTIFUL!! You should smile more often in your videos 😚😚
Love youuu... woke up from a nap super excited to see this video notification lol 💋❣️
Omg! You should do a video shaking your shoulders through the whole video!!! That would be amazing!
Manny please come to Australia 🇦🇺 🙏🏻
Manny I love you more than life
Love you & your videos Manny! 😍💖
I love your channel & really respect the fact that you only have two ads on your video! As a subscriber I don’t want to sit thru a ton of ads
I love you manny!!!!!! ❤️❤️
Okay sis🥵♥️
Faberge egg biiiiihhhh
The annoying orange killed me😂
KINGGGGGGGGGG 😭😭😭
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Am I the only one who tried the finger thing right after he did it in the beginning and failed so badly grhehehe
did you actually just set your face with the laura mercier glow setting powder?
She should have dropped this right at the time game of thrones came out 🤣🤣 for only 2 products I'm kind of like mehhhhh I love and enjoy Nikita.. But this is a bit pricey.. She said to use a flat brush best so idk if I'd use a beauty blender for this.  🤔
Hiii Gorgeous Manny❤️💕
I love your setup!!
The face slaying even more ... how is this possible 😍
I’m surprised Nikita didn’t do a video at all on her own products 🤷🏻‍♀️
Manny is just my favorite❤😁
Love ya hunnnnnty you look so good!!!💕
I thought this looked so good on you!!!
what kind of sponge is he using to apply?
Yassss 😍❤️
The dragon egg is tacki.  Its a no from me jack. But i will say its unique and im glad shes doing what shes doing.
Definitely a pass
a BIG pass
Love you!
not really products the average consumer needs in their daily routine
I've never watched one of your reviews before but you are cuuuuute 😍 lol I might be a new fan 🤔
Manny over here be lookin' like Chester Cheetoh's long lost BURNT twin brother
Rises are red
Violets are blue
I have seen WHAT 
Fame has done to you
The corector looks soother but Its a little over priced
Not impressed with any of her products. Waaay over priced and for what a color corrector that no one even uses and a powder. I'm sorry and that egg is so tacky if she would of made maybe a eye shadow collection and lippys maybe then it would make sense but I just think it's not that exciting
EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS! Please donate here - www.stjude.org/beauty and even if you cant, just know that all adsense from todays video will be going to St. Jude 😍
THIS is what influencers should be doing
I love how he treats her like anybody else, with such respect, and talks about her situation and relate to her, like it isn't sad and scary, when it's truly a heartbreaking situation. I know I wouldn't be able to do that, even though I myself was hospitalized long-term as a child and I know that is what kids in that situation want, I couldn't handle myself the way he did with such dignity.
Donated $100! Every YouTuber should do this and spread the word.. love you manny ❤️
In the first 10 minutes I saw 3 ads and I couldn't be happier about it. Normally I complain about the ads but I'll watch ads all day long to help children. I'm in a very tight financial situation right now and I don't think I'll be able to donate but if I can do something by watching the video, I'll watch this 27,096,582,020 times
My boyfriend just passed away from bone cancer 2 weeks ago , and me and him used to watch your videos together 😂 he said “dont judge me. His makeup is bomb” . Thank you for shedding light on amazing places like st jude
just donated the 23$ left on my card🤷🏽‍♀️
I just donated $15. I wish I could do more right now but I will do more when I can
Only positive thoughts 

She’s so precious!! My heart ♥️ 
Love and prayers for you Hannah and all the kids at st Jude’s
She is precious! Y'all better not be skipping ads in this video! These babies need it! Thank you Manny. This is truly amazing of you! ❤❤❤
Awwww Manny, I applaud you right now....but did anyone else think she already had lip product on??? Her natural lip color is gorgeous, I thought she had lipstick on  ...... LOL 😂 😂
Thank you so very much for donating not just the $10,000 but then also 100% of the money made from this video, in our names. Absolutely incredible! 😊💞
Thank you for doing this Manny! I battled cancer in my early twenties and I can't imagine a child going through any of it.  This warmed my heart ❤❤❤
I'm from South Africa and this made me cry! God Bless you Manny!❤And God Bless You Hannah❤You're a Superstar
I wish more beauty gurus did this with beautiful children like her ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love to see their glowing happiness.
She’s so beautiful and strong!❤️❤️
Love you both :)
St.Jude is a little over 2 hours away from me!! It's important to have influencers like you to help spread the word about such an amazing facility. St.Jude holds a special place in all of our hearts, especially in west TN. This video has to be one of my favorite videos that you have made for sure.
“I’m going to eat a strawberry.” My heart melted...❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everyone on YouTube needs to do more videos like this!! You are AWESOME MANNY!!
God bless this little angel ✨🙏🏼♥️ and you Manny for doing this it’s so beautiful!
i literally got so excited when manny responded to me. my mom got so scared and she asked me why. btw what happens next sounds like a disney movie but i told her why i got excited and she said “i bet i can double that.” i got so confused. so her sister has been battling leukemia and my mom makes monthly payments as donations. I DIDNT even know  about the payments. long story shot she donated $123! she said bc it’s “1-2-3, easy” she’s so corny but i love it lol. hope this aspires everyone.
not skipping any ads for this video. everyone should do the same!
This was such a sweet video and you are such a sweet and loving person.
She is soooo beautiful!!! She is reminding me so much of tinker bell!!! ♥️😊 Manny your such a beautiful soul for doing this!!! Love ya!!! ♥️♥️♥️
Manny, I literally love your giving heart. You are beautiful inside and out. I will be donating to St. Jude monthly. God bless you, Hannah. I pray you are doing amazing!  💞
God she's adorable and her accent makes her even more cute 😭😍
This is now my favorite video of yours! Omg💕🍓
This video is so beautiful!!! You’re so amazing, thank you for it 🙏🏼❤️

Thank you so much for supporting St. Jude! I have lived my whole life 15 mins from the campus. I have raised $$ since I was a child. I have grown up with patients from SJ. As an adult I have friends whose children have been patients there. It is a AMAZING place full of Hope. Thank you for letting people know more about it.
Eating a strawberry, my gosh what we take for granted.
This is amazing. You’re incredible and this video definitely pulled on the heart strings. P.S. I would love a video on your look today in your intro! You’re stunning in every way and I love you!
God bless you Hannah and you also Manny.💜

“I’m gonna eat a strawberry” MY HEART MELTED WHAT A DOLL
I love how his intentions weren’t to remind her about how truly unfortunate her circumstance is, and he simply talked positively and with humour to distract her. This was amazing Manny, I’m so proud of you for using your platform to raise awareness. my donation has been made.
She is so beautiful!! God bless you for doing this Manny ❤️
Omg manny your like the nicest and most amazing person ik (watch) !!

This is my favorite video of all time.
So happy to see you doing this maybe you could turn this into an annual campaign like Taylor did with project beauty share that would be amazing!!
Your video did not show me one freaking add! 😥
she's an absolute angel and thankyou for giving back and helping people x
You have such a kind heart Manny. Great job!
Manny is my favourite he is such an amazing soul
Manny, I've always loved your channel. You are a great makeup artist. You have such a beautiful personality. I love watching your channel because I always learn something and you make me laugh. I was telling my husband I'd love to have you for a neighbor just yesterday. Now, after watching this video, I hold you in the highest regard. Thank you for sharing. I made a small donation but still promise to continue it every pay day. I admire your love and dedication in all you do.
One of the best makeup videos I’ve ever seen
This was so beautiful and heart warming! 😢🥰 can you do an update video in the future?
Whoever disliked this has no heart because this is for a good cause and he is a wonderful person!
i am not able to donate (since im 14) but i didnt skip the ads.
I really respect what you are doing for this charity.  Well done. Love you even more x
Donation made. I just lost my lifelong best friend to cancer in april of last year. It was her 3rd round of cancer, unfortunately this time it was sarcoma in her lungs, and she was pregnant with her daughter. She refused life saving measures for the sake of the baby, who was born at 31 weeks. 2 weeks later, on April 18th, my friend passed away. Her daughter will be 1 in just a little over a week and is the spitting image of her mother. I know how hard it is as an adult to go through cancer, I can't even imagine what it is like for a child. This is definitely something that I'm passionate about and his is an amazing thing you're doing.
This was the most cutest video ever it had my teary but in a happy way i love when people do generous things like this this was beautiful..
Thank you. This made my heart happy 🖤
Speaking of Africa.... hey many I'm a big fan of yours from Zambia 😍 (in south-central Africa )

I love this! My daughter had a cancerous tumor at age 3 and it was devastating. Her chemotherapy and radiation treatment was so hard on her. She ended up losing one of her kidneys due to the cancer but thank God she is still here and just turned 21 last new years eve. Cancer is bad enough as an adult, I can't imagine how it is for children. The strength and hope these kids have is amazing.
HANNAH YOURE SO GORGEOUS. AND THAT SMILE OMG 😭😍

When she was talking about the proton machine which would be  a tough thing to do, trying to stay still for so long, being confined and said “her favorite part....” the positivity from that little girl is inspiring to say the least. So happy you did this manny..loved to watch this video ❤️
Whoever gave this video a thumbs down is trash 😤 you and Hannah are adorable 💖

She's is the sweetest!! 

Cancer is strong in my family so I became a previvor so my children HOPEFULLY won't have to watch me go through what my mum did (She lost her battle 3 years after diagnosis). And in becoming one, my daughter's will now be able to choose to become a previvor when they're older.
Hannah is so adorable 🥰 St Jude’s is an amazing hospital and they are doing so much to help the kids. Can’t believe they solely run on donations, I did not know this. ❤️❤️xx
You are one of the best people I know. You inspire me to do the greatest everyday ! I love you and u make the the happiest 💖

Hi, my name is Myra, I was a St. Jude patient 2016-'17 and had a rare lymphoma. I'm super close with some of the girls at ALSAC that helped to get you there. I was so sad I couldn't make it to meet you, I ended up coming up the next month for follow ups. I really wish I'd been there to meet you, I've been watching your videos for about 4 years. I'm currently in remission, I had Central Nervous System alk positive Anaphylactic Large-Cell Lymphoma (CNS ALCL) which is extremely rare, I was case 28 in the world since 1984 when it was found.
I get paid Friday and it’s my birthday I will be coming back to donate ❤️ I love you and your such an inspiration and great person

SHE IS SO ADORABLE IT HURTS! MOST AMAZING GIRL EVER ❤️
I will definitely donate😀
you are such a beautiful and kind human inside and oustide.i wish i coud get makeover from you(sory for my gramer mistaked)
Always amazed by the wonderful spirit and strength that these kids have. So strong and upbeat. No matter what horrible procedures they have to endure, they keep their spirit. Glad you're helping St. Jude, it's a wonderful hospital that will treat children free of charge.
Small donation made. I have a baby girl and I could never imagine having to go through what these poor children go through on the daily, and hope and pray I never have to. Let's find a cure soon 💜
Omgggg she's so cute 😭😍
First
I'm a partner in hope for St Jude. I donate monthly and can't think of a better place to donate to. I'm actually wearing my tshirt right now they sent me. ❤
wow, Manny. Marry Me.
Your so sweet!!
Hey Manny!! Thnx for bringing awareness to such an important cause. I think cancer is something we can all relate to, whether it’s a family member, a friend or a colleague. I went ahead and donated so that more kids like this little cutie can get the treatment they deserve!! Much love.
How can anyone dislike this video 😭💞
This is so important. Though I’m not personally affected by children’s cancer, my was diagnosed and started fighting about a year ago and I cannot imagine a child going through what I’ve watched my dad go through. Love this video Manny!
Awwww manny and hannah we love you!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
such a sweet person ❤️ she looks so cute! 😭
I love her
I love seeing your heart like this💕😊
I CRIED BUT ITS FINE.
Seeing this little girl go through so much breaks my heart. She is 12 & has gone through more than any adult has ever been through. I have a 13 yr old & cannot imagine what her mother has faced in her baby's lifetime. Thank you Manny for giving her the opportunity to be the beautiful, angelic little girl she, I'm sure has always wanted. Keep up the awesome work with not only St. Jude but with other charities as well. This is why I stuck around.
So So So sweet Manny
Great video - wish Hanna all the best and all the other Children 💖💖 Go Manny 💞
I love saint Jude’s research hospital..... I’m an artist, when I sell my paintings I donate a percentage of the sale of each to either saint Jude or make a wish.
I love this video<3
OMG! This video is soooo cute! I was almos in tears! Manny you are such a good person and such an inspiration! BTW, Hannah, u literally have the prettiest smile!
She’s such a gorgeous girl ❤️❤️❤️
She’s precious
She is soo precious!! I cant )):
I seriously love you so much omg
This is by far my favorite video that you’ve ever made. My aunt passed away from brain cancer on February 3rd of this year, so cancer awareness and support for foundations that help with cancer research has become such an important part of my life. Thank you Manny.
She is so strong ! Good job Manny! ❤❤❤
Manny this video is amazing
My heart literally broke in half when the first thing she said was “I’m gonna way a strawberry” omg she is so cute and humble love her the moooost
I was smiling the entire video and didn’t even notice until it ended
You are amazing ❤️
This video was amazing, Manny and you are such a genuine and generous person! ❤️ I loved Hannah’s bubbly and sweet personality! She is so smart, absolutely beautiful and despite her terrifying situation, she still seems like such a happy little girl. I’m grown, almost 30 and I couldn’t be as positive and happy as Hannah is! ❤️
She’s so cute 😭
I love her I’m crying😭😭😭😭 she’s so happy and perfect! I can’t
She is such a sweetheart! My dad had cancer and it was the toughest times to go through as a family, I cant imagine a child going through that. Sadly I seen many children at MD Anderson(Houstons #1 cancer hospital). Children with cancer are so strong! Im SO happy her treatment (although very rough) has went so well, that's amazing! I hope she gets to go home soon to her regular life and eat some delicious, fresh strawberries🍓
I love this video but I can guarantee not your youngest fan. (My kids are 7,6,4,&2) they love watching all your videos new and old.this video is beautiful and touches my heart.
Why do you call them fans ???
They are suscribers !!!!!
You are not no celebrity 
Stop doing that : 
Appreciate what god has done for you and respect your subscribers !!!!
This video made me incredibly happy
Ow this is so cute ♥️  no matter what
SHE IS THE CUTEST EVER I CANT

Manny this was so sweet and amazing for you to do. Thank you 🙏🏻 for promoting St. Jude it is one of the best charities to donate. ♥️♥️♥️♥️ Hannah was a doll! Prayers to anyone and all who have had to deal with Cancer. Someday soon I hope that that disease will be irradiated from this planet for good.

This is the best 💖
I'm so happy you did this Manny I already do a monthly donation I wish I could do more. My sister had stage 3 colan cancer she went through 10 hours to remove the tumour but thank God she made it and doing well.
This is so pure and beautiful! I couldn’t imagine what she’s going through but Ik having a disease is awful. I was born with muscular dystrophy so I’ve been wheelchair bound my entire life. I’m 19 now and even though my life has been everything but typical I’ve learned that you have to stay positive and find things that genuinely make you happy. Makeup has always been one of those things for me and I absolutely love your channel. You’re so genuine and ily ♥️
I’m eleven love u tho

"eat a strawberry" so precious.
i am unable to donate, but i am watching every advertisement completely through, hoping that might help at all. i love this video💓

CUTEST VIDEO EVER!
My heart. 😭
BEST. VIDEO. EVER!
I love this 🥰🥰😭
2:57 start
This is what influencers should do ..
She’s precious
Omg the strawberry 🥺🥺 what we take for granted everyday. I literally teared up. To want to walk into somewhere without wearing a mask! I work in an operating room so I know how annoying that is.
this is beautiful
When you're a young man and you can pass for a middle aged mom, its time to cut your hair! Lol jk, I'm glad he's doing something positive in this community!
im literally the same age as her and everyday I wear a brown and gold cut crease and he says ''she's only 12 lets not get crazy"
What an amazing young lady ❤️
This is so touching to see
Looking like a little Millie Bobbie Brown x
I was a St.Jude patient for 8 years so seeing this video made me soooo happy! So grateful for you sharing this video and the donations!

I’m actually wearing a “groove for st Jude” shirt as I watch this from a previous donation.  St Jude is a very important organization that’s near and dear to my heart.  I love that you’re doing this for them.
What a cutie she is!! Great job Manny trying to help make a difference .
love this so much
I really love that you did this and bringing attention to this cause. Cancer runs rampant in my family and this cause is close to my heart.. so thank you!
This is such an inspirational video Manny, I already love you before this video but this just gave you your own personal space in heart. Since I work with kids with cancer. I get to see their ups and downs. Love you so much and keep on being an inspiration 😘👏🏼
im mad he said mo pores when he had the chance to say MAnNY pores hahahaha
Awe so sweet :D
We love Hannah Banana 💖💖
This s so nice and very kind
her personality reminds me so much of millie bobby brown, they’re so cute!
St Jude’s isn’t for just kids❤️ I have a spinal Cord Stimulator implanted in my spine and it is a research study from St Jude’s ... Donating today and can’t wait to be on the Glam Squad with my donation. This is wonderful Manny!! You truly have a big heart!! ❤️❤️❤️ I hope people donate

I love how gentle you were applying the concealer and everything you barely touched her face and I love how you gave her a soft glam cause she is a baby , you just gave her a spark which is beautiful , I hope she get better soon and recover 🙏🙏🙏
👏👏👏👏👏💜🙆👍💯
i had chills when she said strawberry
Omg this little girl is amazing I just want to hug her 😍 You're so amazing for doing this Manny!
Oh my gosh. This little girl is so beautiful and strong ❤️ bless you Manny for treating her like an every day person. I’m sure she loved it. This was a great video.
This.is.why. I.love.you💕
Her laugh is so cute!
St Jude is truly an amazing I live in memphis and its really astounding what they do for these children and their families
She is the cutest! 🥰
That is so nice of you Manny. You have a good heart.
I loved every second of this video!!!!
Omg how adorable is she 😍❤
i love you manny dont mind the negative people
When manny post a video with a precious little Angel 👼 and it moves you to tears.-I wasn’t going to put this on here but this is the perfect video for it. I lost my big brother to cancer a few months ago and he was 33 and everyone says that’s sooo young. And to me that is young- so to see children like Hannah who have been through this and are still going through it. I send all my support, prayers and donations. In hopes that everyone can come together to make a difference for these kids. 💕
I want hed the video in order to watch all the ads and raise the adsense, which many said he would donate towards this cause, but seriously no ads ever played..
I'm younger than her lol
I've been a supporter of St. Jude since 1989 and got the privilege to run the Memphis to Peoria (Illinois) St. Jude run in 2000. It's a huge fundraising event where runners raise thousands of dollars to go on the trip. I got to tour the facility....god bless Danny Thomas...meet some of the patients, and then spend the next 4 days running the 454 miles back to my hometown of Peoria. The last weekend of July where you can cook on egg on any outdoor surface in Tennessee. It was the most incredible place I've ever seen and so inspiring. And little Hannah...WHAT A DOLL BABY! She is so precious and so beautiful. Thank you Manny, for bringing this wonderful place into the spotlight and helping to raise funds! They so desperately need it, all the time because no child should die in the dawn of life.
this was my favorite video yet!!!! i love her !!!
You are such an amazing person!
She’s so adorable! I love that you are so supportive of st Jude’s! Iv grew up wanting to help children who are hurt or sick
What a beautiful soul!!
When she said strawberry I died 😭😭😭😭💕💕💕💕
Omg love love love!!! Please do more!!
She is so cute. Manny u looked really happy in this video 😀
Love you even more now!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hope this beautiful little girl's wishes come true.
Such a pretty girl with a bright smile ........wish her all the best in the world.....
You are amazing and she is the cutest!
I love Hannah. She is the type of person everyone wants to be friends with.
This video hits you right in the ❤️. Thank you manny for bringing attention to such a great thing. I’m glad I waited till I got home to watch cuz the tears are flowing. Such a beautiful little girl inside and out.
This is the greatest video you’ve ever done. You can’t always donate your Adsense, but you can certainly shine a light on organizations using your platform. Glam a nurse from Children’s Hospital LA? A woman who escaped DV through a local shelter?

Well done, young man. This Pediatric Nurse approves. 👍❤️
that girl is so cute 😭❤
Wow this was a very fun and interesting and entertaining video and my grandpa donates monthly I always see mail from them about every couple months. With stickers and things
Aww she’s so adorable
yaw this just shows to be thankful for everything you have. this gorgeous wonderful amazing young lady has one of her goals is to eat a strawberry guys i balled.
Did anyone else notice some  subtitles are completely off?
She is a Sweetheart!  Wishing her and all the Children at St. Jude’s Hospital the very Best!
She is so cute! I love her personality. I’m just obsessed with how adorable she is. Also I wish you all the best and hope you’re feeling so much better Hannah!
Wait... 12... what about me I’m 10 eh whatever
So sweet Manny!
i’m 6 months old and i watch your videos, idk what you mean manny
I honestly just want to watch this video as much as possible because while I can’t financially donate, watching the ads is so worth it if it helps these kids and their families 💕💕
I ❤️ this manny
Manny is so beautiful and so is she wow wow wow
Looooove❤️
Manny manny manny! So sk proud of you! Proud of you! You need to watch the movie Heart of Christmas! You  will  bawl! It was so wow! It too was about St Judes! I will donate. They do donations all the time and I think it's the best thing to donate to
Omg I feel her bcz last year my 8 year old cousine had cancer and went to st. Jude but omg Hanna is just an actual angel even though she's 12 but she's so angelic I can't donate but I'll watch till the end💜💜
She is such a happy angel
Her smile is everything
South African love 💜💜💜💜
Thank you so much, Manny! This is an amazing cause! My little sister passed away from cancer when she was 9 and unfortunately we did not know anything about St. Jude’s, I am so thankful they exist and have helped so many! 💕 Hannah is gorgeous and is a bright light in an often too sad world. To be so happy and optimistic after going through literal hell, she is amazing!
Beautiful video x
Amazing video💖💖💖
Such an amazing video 💖 💖 💖
Manny 💚💙❤💛
Proud of u !
I LOVE HER
I am younger 😂
St.Jude helped pay for the parts of my surgery and the medication I needed that my insurance wouldn’t cover. My mom and I were beyond grateful. I encourage everyone to donate when they get a chance whether it’s online or at the checkout of your local store, it’s much appreciated to all the family’s who benefit! ❤️ thank you for an amazing video manny.

Best video you’ve ever done
Manny trying not to swear in front of the girl for 17 minutes straight
IM 12 TOO
This video made me so happy I teared up. Thank you manny for doing this video💜. We do take life for granted and our problems are sometimes nothing compared to what other people and especially children who are so innocent.
I’M MELTING 😭😭😭😭❤️
Omg, Manny! I love you so much more, now. You are an amazing human! This little girl, I'm sure, does appreciate you, and will remember this forever! Way to make her day!

Her giggle gave me life
Manny Hannah is so ADORABLE!!!! I will Pray for all the children at St Jude for their healing. Manny I hope someday that you will be a father you would make an awesome Dad. There are so many children that need a loving family and you would provide that. Love you so much!!
can you give her another makeover a year from now???
please donate. st jude extended my cousins life 10 years past his life expectancy. even though my cousin is gone now they still helped him out so much with his disease. and they are now treating my little brother. anything helps. thank you manny ❤️
Hannah is in my school
I’m curious if watching the full ad equates to more Adsense? (I.e. not skipping an ad)
She’s so cute

❤❤❤
her giggle is adorable

That thumbnail gave me nightmares :,)

Could not have had a more beautiful young lady to start with!! And she is even more beautiful with all the incredible smiles by the end!!! You are a good man for bringing this to our attention and emphasizing all the beautiful features inside and out on this lovely young lady! Thank you! May she be blessed with good health, love and endless happiness!
She's so pretty ❤️what kind of people are those who disliked this video 🤔 ur so kind manny ❤️👍love from Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️
Kind of love you x10000000000 for this video.
Awww sooo cute.... your awesome manny
Wow Manny. ❤️ Didn't have to make us cry.
Aww this is such a heartwarming video
I just donated! Everyone should do a monthly donation even if it’s $1! St Jude is an amazing organization ❤️
When you think someone seems like a lovely person and then they do a video like this. You really are the person I thought, you’re such a sweet and kind person. I’m going to save this video so I can donate when I get paid, can’t bare the thought of losing it x
Awww when she said au pair and he said your pet? Lol
That’s so cute!!
Cutest video ever!
But I still donated
The only thing that kills me is our donations also pay the ceo and of course everyone else working in yhe hospital which is fine. St judes has the 2nd highest salary for Ceo which brings them 1 million a year from donations. That is beyond extravagant in my eyes and completely rediculous! I love that non profits help families that need it. But at the same time some people who have barely anything that donate are making rich richer too!
12:57 manny almost said “y’all get my crusty ass leftovers “ and realized he was filming w the 12 year old and changed it REAL quick 😂
11:50 that laugh ❤️
She’s such a beautiful person
thank you Manny for just being there & making a difference in their life’s. this was one of the best videos I have ever seen. Your the best!❤️
This video touched my heart I love you manny your a beautiful person ❤️
Such a sweet video, can definitely see you genuinely care x
It always feels good to help others when youre not even asked.😍
First time commenting, this video was the sweetest. Hannah was just the sweetest.
SHE'S SO CUTEEE and reminds me of Amybeth McNulty from Anne with an E. I hope everything goes well for her 💞
Manny you are so awesome love you

She is so cute and so sweet ❤️😍
She’s such a doll! 🥰
Can’t wait for baby girl Hannah to get some strawberries! 🍓🍓🍓

This is the absolute best video I’ve seen! Thank you Manny for showing this amazing young lady and to get the word out for donations. You have a heart I wish more people could see that. I believe you are the only person who is willing to fix themselves to be better, other people just talk about it but you are doing it!! That’s why I’m still with you Manny and support you all the way.

Let's make this video go viral so that everybody donates and Hannah and the rest of the kids at St. Jude's can go home cured!  Donating!
You are such a humble amazing person for doing this. Being an adult with cancer. I know how hard it can be. I cant imagine a child going through it. I just wanted to say thank you for what you did and are doing!!!
The sound is so soft
Aw Manny, I love this. Thank you for using your platform for something positive and to bring awareness to St. Jude's. Loved this vid! ❤️😊

Girl, you'll get to eat that strawberry!

Let me just wipe this running mascara real quick.
I love this video so much Manny and I love you even more ❤️
😍 This was precious and heart-warming to see your relationship with the young lady as you interviewed her while applying her makeup. This was powerful.
Oh my soul!!! Im from South Africa!!! That place looks amazing, all the technology and awesome people that work there. Wow! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Ive been through so much the last year and one memory i have is that i would always watch your videos to distract me on my treatment days. so seeing this brought me back and truly melted my heart. thank you for bringing awareness to cancer and st.jude. You are wonderful manny!!!!
0:03 when manny looks like the guy on home alone when he got sprayed in the eyes with the black spray paint. Love you manny!

Hi Manny your such a good person helping people like that
Wow manny this is so heartwarming she’s amazing
she has a BEAUTIFUL smile
Wow. I dont really watch manny anymore but this video cought my eye! And wowww he handled tallking to this cutie so so good!! Many other people would make this situation like sad(?) and probably keep telling her how they feel sorry for her but damn manny actuallu talked to her as a friend and really understanding and supporting!! This girl also looked really comfortable and happy talking to him and I feel like espacially people who had to go through so much like her just are tired of hearing all the time that people feel bad for her and rather would like to be talked to like a friend! :) well done!
Oh my heart just melted into a million pieces thank you Manny and Hannah she is just the sweetest little girl I'm so glad she is on the road to recovery and the I'm going to eat a strawberry and go to a restaurant awww hunny I hope u get to eat a whole punnet to urself
IM 11!!!!!!!
Our school donates each month
Omg. This video taught me a lot, that there is a lot of things we have to thank god for it. Either breathing, eating whatever we want or even going out without being afraid or being the only thing that everyone are looking at. Like literally thank God for everything. We do have a lot of blessings but we don't appreciate it ever. Thank God.
So cute omg goddddd
St Jude has ALWAYS been my charity of choice. EVERY CHILD DESERVES a chance at life!!! 🙏 So awesome of you Manny to support them 👍 ❤️
💕💕💕
You're so sweet here, Manny! Do more of these videos!

“It’s not on sale.”

Manny had to ask where the clearance section was and that’s the first place I go at every store
I died at his genie in the bottle finger wiggle
I hate when beauty influencers are like wowwwww can you see what this is doing?! All these cracks and lines and oh my pores!!! Ugh!... like no I can’t see anything. They need to start zooming in the cameras a lotttt, even if it’s just for a second to see the texture. Love this video though! Especially the vlog portion!
“I don’t steal, OMG...
I dOn’T sTeAL!!!” 😂😂😂
Do a full face for $20
“Made in China? No ingredients? Love that.” 😂😂😂
You should do comedy, i always laugh watching you😂
But when manny said “why am I such a pendeja” I FELT THAT SIS!! 😂💕 Love you ❤️
Should’ve just started over with the L’Oréal foundation stick.
Imagine trying to find some decent clearance items at Ulta and finding Manny, crouched on the floor, spilling stuff EVERYWHERE

Manny, I love your videos, but that white background is giving me a headache! ❤😅
you should check out "riverdale" and Empire, Star and Siren... Good job!!
“You can’t just be like ‘look how much product came off on my fingers”

‘The Order’ a Netflix original, if you like supernatural/werewolf/magic it’s really good! Literally just watched the last episode!!
How could anyone hate you. 😂😂 You are so funny and entertaining.
LOVE THE MANY WAND THANG:):) nostalgic:):)
Can you do the same videos but Marchalls or TJ Max or Both💕
The vlog at Ulta 😂❤️ you never fail to make my day, start vlogging more!!
U said "Radiant Diamond" and I made the same face you did, LOL! Like <eeeew> :D
Good Girls!! On Netflix is amazing, the new season is on Hulu right now too!
Biiiitch check out Altered Carbon. It's REALLY cool! Netflix.
Netflix has Schitts Creek and Reign, Awesome shows!
Amazing it actually came out good defiantly would change the lashes ❤️
11:20 “omg I feel like a makeup artist” you are manny 😂❤️
Omg you so amazing😭❤i love you so much❤
Turn them damn lights down next time so we can seeeee how bad your skin is bc it looks flawless on my screen! Makes me wanna go buy that foundation that you say looks bad! Also I've tried that loreal stick and it's good by itself it's much more light weight and melts into the skin perfectly. 
Just an FYI.
Lights down hoe.
Omg. Ur so damn funny. I love ur chanel.. God bless you😘😘
I know you hated the look but I think you slayed it ❤
you’re awesome! super funny and i love your personality! keep it up 🤩
You need to vlog more manny!! It’s awesome 😭😭❤️  best personality ever fr fr !
I live for this new style he’s doing!! 💙📸🚙
Manny where did you get your earring from ? It look so badass 😍😍
Manny MUA- omg I feel like I'm a MUA 🤦‍♀️
Loved loved loved  this video please do more like this it was amazing 💜💜
I loved this!!! Best thing to watch after waking up from a nap 😂😂 you should watch how to get away with murder if you haven’t Already!!! And yesssss you should vlogg more in the car, I love it !!! ❤️
If it’s on clearance sometimes doesn’t mean it sucks lol. It just means that collection is older and they need to get rid of it for the new products.
“Esponja, that means sponge” Learning from Manny 👍🏻
The ulta felt tip eyeliner is awesome!! I just bought recently and for someone that is trying to practice a wing look....it’s real easy to work with!
"that means sponge!" we love a spanish class momentttttt <3
the Ulta lip takes a bit to dry down but I live by their liquid lips
Okay, come on eye look! Why are you so freaking cute! Ugh, you're perfect 😍❤ Everytime I get an Ulta beauty product, it never works for me. Besides their lip infused oil, they smell great and feel good on  the lips. You definitely made the most out of this!
I love you Manny. You’re so much more paisa now 😂
I love when you were in the garage Nick Jonas chains was playing
The Disney outline gave me flashbacks 😂🤣😂
Note to self DO NOT watch Mannys Videos late at night when everyone is sleeping I literally just woke up everyone from laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love you Manny 😘😘😘😘

You should go to TJ MAX and buy all the knock off makeup.
I think you should keep the plain background it looks a lot better.
THAT DISNEY THROWBACK OMGGGGG GAGGED🤣🤣
I love your eyeshadow game today ✨🖤✨
You should do a series that consist of you driving around or somewhere and you should call it Driving with Manny
And The Umbrella Academy on Netflix is amazing and I highly recommend it
My fav shows:
Penny Dreadful
The 100
American Horror Story
Altered Carbon
You
Black Mirror
Violet Evergarden
Haunting of Hill House
Between
OA

(Pretty much anything super dark)
;)

Hey Manny!! i believe Melisa created two blushes in her palette, I dont think it is supposed to be a contour shade lol but that is okay since she created a very personalized collection. Also, at least you sound better than i did when i first pronounced filipino words 😂 love ya 💕

The Nyx palette here is still $35. Wish it was on sale like yours lol
I hate that feeling when you buy a bunch of makeup and can’t wait to try it and then it ends up looking like crap ugh 😑 I know the feeling.

Also watch the Umbrella Academy on Netflix
Would have used a lip liner for the lips with that nude cute look,💜😍

When you say soak your sponge before you use it...does that mean you soak it in water to soften it up more or do you spray it with setting spray?
Girl you’re 6 ft 😯
Watch “Designated Survivor” on Netflix! Sooo good.
When manny says “we made eye contact” and points to his forehead/eyebrows instead of his eyes 😂💕
Have you watched The Umbrella Academy?? It is absolutely AMAZING!!!! I think you will like it. ❤❤❤❤❤
Hey Manny heeeeyyy! I love your vlogging bits. And although this video has nothing to do with it, I also like when you do mukbangs. It's a refreshing change and always fun because of your humor and you just being you ❤️
U should watch Billions, it's really good!!!
You should switch the mascara want to use the brush that you like more with the formula that you like
I can't get enough of u.... so entertaining 💕💕💋
That ULTA has one hell of a clearance section! The ULTA where I live hardly has anything 😂

You should watch Umbrella Academy and The Order
How did you make your index finger into waves?🙃
Watch Queer Eye on Netflix!! I LOVE that show! But you’ll need some tissues every now and then!

A little bit behind but just finished watching Jane the Virgin....OBSESSED!!!! Super easy to binge watch. So sad that this next season is the last ☹️
Manny, I like your vloggy videos. Also, it's different. I'm happy to see your channel coming back. It's awesome to see the comeback!! Love you!

God this made my laundry folding go by so much faster, love you Manny welcome to the valley I’ll see you around xoxo
I love the addition of the vlogs and when you speak Spanis!!! Please do another video in Spanish it was great. Love you, Manny.
I am living for your "quadruple liner" look 💕 if you like watching cooking/baking shows the great British baking show is EVERYTHING. Oh also, I used to work for Ulta and usually it's the cosmetic company that discontinues items so Ulta clearances them out but sometimes Ulta stops carrying the items/specific colors/ brands
The Mary Poppins moment had me dying 🙄🤣💀
Manny face when he is shook is heartwarming
"Is it anything to go tell your mom about like chisme? No, its not!" 😂 If I find a good product I literally go tell my mom right away!!
In Tagalog (Filipino)

Maganda is like calling someone beautiful and 
Mahal means love
“Can I sing for you?”
sings anyway
Is that a piccolo shirt?? That’s definitely one of my favorites! You should try seven deadly sins if you haven already.Love you❤️
I was wheezing watching you clean up the shelf you dropped😂
I looooove your piccolo shirt! 😭❤️💕
Manny is soo relatable. He is me when I see anything on clearance.😆
I recently started watching this show on Netflix called "Reign".......let me just say, its fantastic. The episodes are long but they keep me interested the ENTIRE time its playing. Great for binge watching, plus I think its like 3 or 4 seasons.
Your bloopers are literally the best 😂😂
As soon as you picked up the Ulta foundation I was like noooooo don’t do it!!! It’s soooo heavy!!!!
You mood today. I'm living
yess i love these videos u and jenny need to do i together!!
I’m down for it. More videos like this?!!! And by the way, the eye look 👀 love it 🥰
U r such a road rage! Lmao🤣🤣🤣
You should try the new show good trouble !!
I'm so into Bates Motel right now!! I've been loving the Fluff out of it!!!
I WISH my ultas clearance section looked like this im literally shooook!
I loveeee this video manny but I love your shirt too it’s so bomb ❤️
Honestly, I definitely think it would’ve looked good without the ulta foundation but everything else 😊 the L’Oréal foundation seemed a lot nicer

I’ve always enjoyed Manny’s videos but lately i have absolutely loved them 😂😂 I don’t know why but I have been finding them so funny lately. Manny needs to start vlogging or start doing Drive with me videos 😂
That eyeshadow look is everything !!!! ❤️
That's exactly how we feel here in Canada!! Lol your intro😂 "THE SUN!"☀️ She's been a rare appearance here lol.
"I feel like a make up artist" he says like he doesn't do make up for millions of people to watch 😂😂
You need to watch The Sinner. It's only 8 episodes but it's really good
Manny is everything i adore youuuu 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The Nyx shadows I have purchased have almost always been good. I loved this look.

Manny, Maganda means beautiful in Filipino! 💖 (Tagalog)
What is a good foundation and eyebrow  makeup for oily skin 😩
DONT DO DRUGS. THANK YOU, NEXT
Te quiero mucho a ti ya tu canal...espero que veas esto porque eres una gran inspiración para mí con el maquillaje y para aprender espanõl ♥️♥️♥️
I’ll never forget the one time I tried clearance makeup on my friend to try to add to my portfolio...never again 😂😂😂😂
the editing in this is lit, screaming!!!!!
A really good show, Grimm, used to be on NBC. If you're into scifi, but the main character is HOT!!! I think you'll really like it.
Wtf I couldn’t move my fingers like how he did in 1:10 ... wow like I was struggling 🙄
JUST AS WHEN I HAD NO ONE ELSE TO WATCH ON YT. YAS KWEEN MANNY 😝
You can definitely tell when manny is feeling himself in the camera😂
You're so beautiful 😻
Your eyes are 🤬 fierce. If you decide to stray from Lilly lashes at Ulta, try Eyelure. They have many bold styles.
I love your eyeshadow muñeca chula*;0)
SCHITTS CREEK ! Please watch it !!!!! It’s on Netflix the first 4 seasons
Let’s talk about the T-shirt...I LOVE IT!!

Santa Clarita Diet low key such a good show
Wentworth is amazing!
Just wanted you to know that two nights ago at CVS, I tried to grab a powder, and the entire container of shelves with foundation above it fell over and spilled EVERYwhere. I wanted to die. A really nice lady came and helped me pick them up. There’s still good people in this world 🙌🏻
Excuse me while I recreate this look 😍😍
OMG "you're watching Manny's channel"  throws brush LOL I love you Manny 2:00
I see you Manny I see you boo talking espanish lol 😋 Jejej Eres el mejor Manny me encantan tus videos eres buena onda eres genuino y muy gracioso ❤️
Manny! Swear that this video is by far my favorite. You’re too funny, love ya!
The umbrella academy is 👌👌 for a new show if you haven't seen it
Love your videos. I was also wondering were did you get your viewfinder I've been looking for one and cant find one anywhere.
Charmed, did you say Charmed?  You did!  Re-watched all the seasons recently.  I was around when they first came out.  YARRRR!!!!!
Your bloopers are the cutest! 😂♥️♥️♥️♥️
Have you watched On My Block? Season 2 comes out on the 29th. It’s soooooo good!!!
I laughed through this entire video! 😂 Manny, you always make me smile.....
OBSESSED with this eye look!!!
I use the swear by it pallete every day for my eyeshadow. It's actually better then my Anastasia 🤷🏻‍♀️
I'm really out here saying "erres what erres." thank you Manny
Manny is actually a really intresting person
you in your videos are getting weirder and weirder by the sec... and i love it
Ur eyes remind me of Moana!!! Love it
I wish this guy was more successful than James Charles.
My god that look is everything!! Love that!
The eye look is so neat! Do more looks like this😊
hehe i’m meeting u at beautycon if i see u😔🤩
I've missed u♥️
As a morena, I live for pigmented bronzers 💩
The blush is literally too much
Guilty! ✋ I love CLEARANCE!!!!! 😘
If I wake up my children with my uncontrollable laughter I'm charging you damages 😂😂😂
Open your eyes you look amazing ❤️
Manny you need to vlog more 😂😂
The fosters !!
what is your sign ?  I am just curious to know 😁
Yeah!!!! Fabulous way to end a night, thanks babe! ❤
I’ve been watching you since 2015. I love the shit outta you. You’re the reason why I got into makeup in the first place. And helped get me out of the depression o was going through at the time. I love you manny😩❤️
So surprised that nyx palette was on sale! I’ve heard SUCH good things!
Literally watched 5:17 like 10 times and died laughing every time
LMAO Ulta took the “hd” way too seriously😂😂
So thanks😁❤️
Wow ur pretty tall.. where’s my 4’11 squad
Watch workin moms..... so funny😹😹
U TAKE WAY TO LONG TO START A FREAKING VIDEO
Manny not having it in the beginning of the video 😬🤣💀
Another marketing tactic is to heavily discount for a short time in attempt to spike sales.  People tend to assume discounts mean low quality so that can damage a brand.  However, NYX Is already a lower price point for known quality, so lowering the price of this palette on your video wouldn't severely damage them.
If you haven’t watched One Day At A Time on Netflix, you have to! It’s SO good!
Piccolo is on his shirt and I need to see it!
All of the vlog footage is amazing
You don't look like a pendeja or a caquita, you always make it work hunty! Totally gorga! 🤩
Manny is me with road rage nobody in Cali knows how to drive anymore smh
Got my mozzarella sticks 🤣
I actually really love the loreal stick foundation
Lol what is that finger movement.. lol love u mannymua!!?
You trying to swallow the eye shadow*** I'm DEAD🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙈 and jeeeeeeeeeesus your a messy shopper and a loud one too* loved the large eye shadow compact ( pigment..... omg!) I think everything else was a pass for me. But you made it work.
12:29-12:37
"Me too, lets be honest..."
I watch Riverdale. You should watch it. It’s pretty good
should of just named this full face of ulta brand makeup lol
My God I love you more than life ♥️
“Honestly perfect 69 height” 😂😂😂
OKAY PICCOLO! I SEE YOU 😋💚
For as big a YouTuber you are, I feel like your production quality could be higher. You should make the effort to provide multiple angles on the face, zoom up closer when you do eye looks, do the close in, clear shots of products and swatches
Actual trash 😂😂😂
You're so gorgeous! Any man would be so lucky to have you! Muah! A woman can still dream. Lmao
Copied Sylvia Gani much ,huh
ok but I died when he was like “can I sing for you?” And just started singing 😂😂 and wtf why were his fingers doing that 😂😂😂
ulta beauty highlighters are actually bomb .
I love when he does these car intros. Honestly the best

The Disney channel bit 😂😂 I’m done. I love you

You make me laugh so hard 😂
OMG I WAS THE FIRST LIKE
Try the l'oreal stick foundation on it's own its honestly not that bad!
I actually liked the way ur eyeshadow turned out. It looks like u were channeling ur inner 80's child. Very vibrant.
Love the eyemakeup 😍😍
Its not on sale because it doesn’t have the orange sticker
drops
It is now
Sounds like me lately. I have trouble sleeping.  I've been bringing all my You Tube Fav Channels and on Hulu, I watch The Good Doctor, The Resident,  New Amsterdam, All Chicagos... Med, PD and Fire. Netflix is ZOO, Shameless, Mom, The Good Girl and a few more. I'm caught up on most TV shows. Need some more shows!!!! What's good?
Watch Castlevania on Netflix if you haven't yet!
I searched: the most beautiful person in the world and I found pictures of you

Can you wave your fingers like that again 👀 😳
Lmao that Disney wand 😂❤️
Wow i dont ever watch manny but him buying stuff in ulta 😂 oh my god that was hilarious
What kind of car do you drive Manny? Love you!
love charmed, I finished it a long time ago, I should probably rewatch it i forgot alot that happened. im watching The Umbrella Acadamy right now.
Now I'm so curious about the Charmed actor 🤔
I have a melissa palette and I hate it.. no pigment and powdery.. its different then the one u got it has only one heart and some eyeshadows. Love your video's manny and how u blogged your haul. Keep the video's coming and I didn't mind the video being over 30 mins I really enjoyed it your so funny.
Who else loves the latin@ side of manny ?😂💀❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ulta products are always so disappointing)):
Manny makes me laugh so much omg I’m never not entertained 😂
Hi manny! Just want to say that i am an Ulta employee and i just wanted to help clear up some speculation. There is nothing wrong with the items that go on sale. To say they are “clearance for a reason” is suggesting that they mark them down because they are bad quality which isn’t the case. Brands have to mark them down because they are launching new items. And sometimes it’s more expensive to send them back so they just mark them down. Love your videos and your channel! ❤️
Love watching you and a good show in Netflix is the cable girls you live it 😘😘
Greys anatomy station 19 and the good doctor r all fucking amazing
Those eyes are STNUTINGGGGGGGG.!!! 😩😍👀 #UBetterManny.!!!

His road rage is me Lmaoo I love it

Any bts armies thought of Shooky when he said shooky
Oh and TV shows YES I binge sooo fast too. Some shows Ive been watching: the Orville, Marvel Runaways, Brooklyn Nine Nine, Orange is the New black, Brockmire, Ray Donovan.... I am sure there's more lol.  Oh it's older but I lovvved Grimm, wish it hasn't ended!
ulta beauty setting sprays smell so good fr. i think that all nighter (as tana once said) smells like your hands after giving a handjob, but a bomb ass setting spray
Man I if he was in ulta he was obviously interested in you babe.😍
You are the funniest person everrrr 🤣🤣
Omg I spy piccalo 😊🙌🏽
I'm obsessed with your dragon Ball shirt 😂😍

That Disney insert though 😂😂
“wish me luck so I don’t get hit... or I don’t hit anyone”  lmaooo me tooo! 😂

How fun Manny. I always wondered how well the ULTA products work.
I love the spiciness of this video haha
Ok I am loving this eye look!!!
Ok I am loving this eye look!!!
I DEFINITELY prefer warm tones ! I’m from Indiana and my insta is @jesspeekbaby
Ulta brand just sucks, I cannot find anything that works or doesn't look yellow. I even got a chemical burn from their brand makeup.
Try black mirror vandersnatch something like that. Supposedly you can create your own ending on Netflix
Omg I LOVE you!!! ❤❤❤❤
'Stop looking at me, you can't have it!'
You’re literally me in traffic😂💗
bates motel on netflix is trippy af
Everytime I'm having a bad day I come watch you Manny and you always cheer me up! Seriously you make me laugh so much!
gosh you make me laugh so hard
I could listen to you talk ALL DAMN DAY!
For the life of me I couldn't remember who you reminded me of but IT'S JACK from WILL & GRACE "JUST JACK!!!!!"
The bronzer actually doesn’t look bad!!! ❤️
WTF?? NYX SWEAR BY IT FOR $7???? DEAD.
13:59 😣😣😣❤
21:26 😂🤣😂👋
I got that Melisa Michelle cheek set too on a super sale at Ulta for $3
Do your current fav beauty products!!! Give us a update on your everyday routine. 

PS I love you 😘
I loved this video!! 😍💜
anyone else kinda stopped watching manny but you don’t know why because he’s a bop? ily manny
Watch the umbrella academy on Netflix!
Have you seen Good Girls on Netflix 💁🏼😍
I just binged all of The Order on Netflix!!!
I love your bloopers omg😂😂♥️
Everytime you say basuda makes me think of hs Spanish my teacher would scream at me bc I talked in English all the time so one day I said you basuda and she looked at me I laughed and said I’m Greek and Italian mama yelling is nothing new and she laughed as well and long story short I took one year of Spanish lol I loved it just needed more credits haha love you!!💋♥️♥️
I am laughing so hard😂
That blush tho...lol wth 😂
You don't like looking into the camera huh?
I recommend  degrassi for  a  Netflix  show
You got in a sunset eye mood thank you very much it’s finally sunny and warm here in Chicago 💙☀️🌊🌈
Me when I’m driving 😂😂 the singing and the little Disney thing . I live for your videos 💜
This humour is great, love it.
Omg wow early crew. I am LIVING!!!!!! So Fun!
When Manny says “Oh my heck” and, because you were too, you know he or his family must have been raised Mormon. That’s no shade or disrespect to the faith. But as someone who also was brought up in a Mormon family, you have only ever heard LDS people say this phrase.
He’s hilarious😂
Some shows I recommend are: on my block, somewhere between and one day at a time.
Shhhiiiddd 7.50 or 8.50 is still to pricey for me...
Honestly, we need more Manny car vlogs. Oooh how about doing your makeup while driving? 😂😂 
I can imagine you making an abrupt stop because of the car in front while applying foundation or highlight causing you to mess it up and saying "Estúpida, mi highlight idiota"
I think the NYX pallet was on sale because nobody wanted to pay 35 dollar's for what's suppose to be drug store ya know.... NYX has been REALLY HICKIN UP THE PRICES LATELY AND I'M NOT LIVING 👌👌👌👌🙅🙅🙅🆗🆗🆗.... I have seen Allie Glines( she is another you tuber) do a review on this pallet and she made me want it, and now you are LOL EXPECIALLY  now that it's on sale.. I just HOPE that my Ulta has it... Love You Manny ❤️❤️💕💋💋
DO A DOLLAR TREE MAKEUO VIDEO!
💙 your shirt manny!!
Lol, love the mickey, you're watching Manny's channel.
Please always vlog - basically like watching myself in a store and in Atlanta traffic. Good to know someone else knocks over entire bins by touching something else.
THE FINGERS AT 1:12 IM SCREEEEEAMING
Thats a straight from the Disco look! Love it!
$5.19 question:. Marketers go with psychology that prices that end in 9 like 5.99, 5.19, etc sounds like you're getting a better deal.  People see prices like 5.99 as $5 vs. $6. In the case of 5.19, you see it as that much closer to an even $5 vs. $5.20
New girl is my favvvv Netflix show!!!!!
I worked at ulta and yes there brand is trash
I love your Piccolo shirt 😀
Wtf am I gonna do with this? Basura.. 😂😂
You are so cute I love you ❤️
U made my day 💓
You need to vlog more 😂😂😂😂
I don’t think anyone can complain about the nyx palette when it’s on sale for $8 and they work and blend and are pigmented & u get all those colors . There are single shadows for $7-$8 😬😬! I approve , for the sale price though not $35
“  Is it anything to go tell your mom ,    Chisme “ hahahahaha yu crack me up !!! Hahaa yu shuldd make a chisme timeeee video

The last kingdom is a good show and it's on netflix, I think you would enjoy it, however I don't know what your genre for shows/movies is so this is just a suggestion.
Did anybody see what the protein powder brand was that manny posted on his Snapchat?!
Manny please make a vlog channel.
You pretending to be on a Disney channel commercial = priceless 😂😂
CHARMED IS AMAZING
“Are you wearing lashes?” ABSOLUTELY!! Dead 💀 😹
“I wanna see it... but like, on the plane”

Where is Manny from I know he lives in LA but is he also from here???
Why are you soooo funny, lol I cant with you👑👑
You’re so cute manny 😂
I LOVE THE BLOOPERS 😭😭
Were gonna keep smiling 😅
The foundation is AWFUL but I LOVVVVE that eye look!
watch temptation island lolll
I am actually deceased at your little Disney channel/manny’s channel thing 😂😂
Why are he and Laura not making videos together anymore :(
Can we be friends. I love your witty banter.
Manny, please do more videos like this! I was smiling and laughing so much from the very beginning! And all the side comments made my week so much better
You are one of the few you tubers I let the ads play lol..... get that coin baby
the genie in a bottle part 😂😂
I see that Piccolo shirt!
That eye look! DECEASED!
I hate the ULTA brand foundation. It did the same thing to me as it did to you. I have the same feelings on all these products as you do. I have the lash set but I haven't tried them yet. Sometimes I like a lash that's light and can't tell I have them. I do have the matte lip cream in a dark pink/burgundy color. Mine actually dried matte. Sorry yours didn't. Anyways, thanks for your thoughts on all of this. I'm glad I'm not the only one that feels this way about some of these products. Hey, have you tried any of the essence products?
So as soon as you said what shows do y’all like I immediately thought omg let’s be friends!!! I love finding shows that other people watch and talk about it with them!! Please watch Schitts Creek and grace and Frankie if you haven’t already. They’re hilarious and I love rewatching them!! Let me know what you think if you watch them. 🥳
Love the Piccollo shirt!
I would love to see a full face of Ulta brand makeup!
it looks almost mod kinda love it
Yassssss that’s my manny!
THE TALENT JUMPED OUT 😂😂😂 I DIIEEDD
I’m laughing so hard my dog is staring at me like I’m on crack 😂
I ♥️ the look !
Wow you slay 😍❤️
That Disney channel part 😂
THE FUUUCK 😲 HOOOW did you do that with your fingers at the beginning?? What kind of superpower is that? 😦
I Always LOVE watching your videos!!! I laugh so much at the things you say lol like basura and horchata and not to mention PENDEJA!!! I really enjoy watching you. Your videos make my DAY BETTER !!! ❤️
Obsessed with your shirt! Where did you get it?
LMAO! Manny PORQUE!!!! 😂😂😂 dile HOLA MUCHACHO 😘😘😂😂😂
Sex Education on Netflix is fire!!!!
And now I want a horchata... 🥛
I really wanna know where’d you get your Piccolo shirt from? 👀
U are so goofy! I love you!
Lol at Tim “the tool man” Taylor!!! That was SO his voice!!!
Everytime you have said welcome back to my channel I have thought of the Disney childhood memories and you finally did it!!! Omg yasss!:)
Loved this video and your channel!! 😍😁🤗 but it gave me an idea for a fun video. I think it'd be fun if you had someone buy you a full face of high-end makeup and the affordable version and then you had to guess which one was high end and what was affordable and what one you liked better! Hope you consider it! ❤️
Have Nick narrate your video! Lol
Is he wearing a DBZ shirt ? :0
Manny mua wearing lashes for 5 min straight
I seriously hate how he’s trying to be like angel baby( adore Delano )
I love your road rage 😂 I liiive
Bruh. One time I went to Ulta. There was a facial serum on sale for $5 when it was originally $30-40. I was shook. I kept walking by it and just kept thinking it couldnt be right. The serial number on the box of the serum matched the coupon tag and everything. I triple checked that bitch. I go up and she says the original price and i said hold up, it says $5 underneath it. I told her the serial number matched and everything. She goes “to check” and puts it BACK and comes back up and said it was a “weird coincidence” and continued checking me out. I was like uhhhhhmmmm i dont think so lol. I bought the rest of my products and moved on. It was hella weird.
Even though you hated the makeup, you still made a fire look. So talented, its crazy.
#thriving ✌🏻 JAJAJAJ DIED
Lol stop trying be like Louie solo el dice estupida .. jk jk 💁🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️😂

Does the sun just leave when manny comes out like bruh there’s a problem when your as white as the background
There finally not dumping there used makeup in the trash
Greys anatomy
Love you manny when you made a mess that’s my entire Life summed up in the one

Sam and nic are Aussies
I love this!
You need pore filler duh
When you said the comment about who loses money when something is on sale, I've wondered that as well.  I'm assuming the store since they bought the item then resell it?
I want the eyeshadow palette when you are done
U need to do a target and Walmart one
My jaw dropped when you did that thing with your fingers
I love Manny's vlogs!!
sis don’t lie your only making this video because you have to shop in the clearance section now

Awesome 👏 babe! 😘
Those Nyx shadows! My everyday eye look at work is from a little six-color Nyx palette that the cashier threw into my bag for free at Ulta. The colors are perfect, it doesn’t crease or transfer... I love it.
Oh my hat, you are my favourite! Thanks Manny, you just made a shitty day better.

Youtuber here on YouTube

Those ulta liquids lips are traaaaaagic. I bought some during a binge to qualify me for extra points. They smell horrible, don’t dry matte, they settle into your lips like dead lady lips, and are tacky AF. No ma’am
Basura~ 😂😂😂

"The Talent Jumped Out" Gosh you make me Roll in the floor! I Love You SO MUCH MANNY!!!

BANSHEE!!!! SO GOOD SOOO MUCH ACTION AND DRAMA!!!! THERE'S 4 SEASONS!!!
They are in clearance is because they are about to expire
Did anyone else put their phone down and try to move their fingers like Manny did while singing genie in a bottle? Cus I did, and it was unsuccessful.😑
😘
😘
What eyeshadow palette?
PICCOLO!!!!!!
That foundation is like the collection lasting perfection concler it won’t blend and the undertone is terrible and shows your pores way way to much 😬
IT,S WENSDAY MORNING AT 6AM HAVE NOT BEENTO SLEEP YET PART OF MY FIBROMYALGIA
Manny I was laughing the whole video 😂😂
When everything ended up on the floor 😂 my life...literally...
So glad you did this video. . Now I know I was right to not purchase any items from the clearance baskets. I was always tempted to but I just couldn't trust them.

Are you single?
Orange is the new black is a good show. Also, new girl
You being loud and screaming used to be less annoying but it spikes the audio so much every time... you really need to fix your levels. Plenty of people are loud without making my speakers crackle...but not you, the spikes in audio are horrific. I couldn't finish the video...
SLOW DOWN
YUCKS FEELING"L.…

That finger movement moment...🙌🏻
I’m dying at the beginning 😂😂
Sis can't afford high end makeup because those palette sis selling are flopping.
WHERE IS YOUR SEATBELT
They are YouTubers here on YouTube! Lol
I want to make a pretty sunset eye!!! 😫 I need to practice
You’re everythinggggggg when you drive
BasuRa / horchata 🤩🤣
BITCHHHHH I only made it to the 1 minute mark and I’m already dying about the comment you made about the hot gym guy! “Perfect height for 69ing! MANNY I CANT WITH YOU SWEETIE 🤪
Is he high?
"She is a YouTube here on YouTube" lmaooo that's me sis
Well my favorite was that highlight!! Wooo shining 🌟🌟
My dream is to meet you and just hang out you’re literally the best 😊
Laughing so hard !! Love this
Your eyes are amazing! I know you you don’t like the highlighters, but they look pretty awesome from over here. Fun video!
I have the nyx palette and it’s actually good🤷🏼‍♀️ and I paid 38 DOLLARSSSSS
MANNY START THE CHALLENGE OF 100 LAYERS OF FOUNDATION. From watching today’s video of of two layers and you hated it I think that challenge would be funny asf!!! Love ya😍
dead with the nyx palette 😩
I cannot with the Disney channel 😂😭
That Ulta foundation sounds like it really was HD, just not in the way you wanted.
I love you the most💜
I know the foundation and setting spray didn’t work for you, but you can’t tell at all. You look beautiful!
Lmao love you MANNNNYYYY !!
I just came back to your videos, and i love watching them because somehow i get so relaxed. One thing that i found to be different, is that i feel like you have to be funny all the time. You dont have to and you are better just being yourself. Just want you to be relax and dont feel that everything has to move so fast. You are cutting away every pause and its remining me of logan paul style. Thank you!
Wow you still exist
Give the foundation about 6 hours and it’ll break up or at least it did on me
But why was this the funniest video you’ve made? You been doin some improv comedy too manny?loved this video! 💋💋💋💋
It’s sad how your fam is done!!!!
flash back mua

I wish the Ulta near me had a good variety in the clearance section. But the palettes be open and broken. Just a mess.
Just for reference for any Ulta shoppers on the red ticket items are actually clearance, the white ticket are still full price but are ticketed because they’re not on the planogram and don’t have visible pricing so we just toss them in the back by clearance and white ticket the regular pricing on them

Omg you should do a full face of ShopMissA makeup! 💕🤠🥳😛
I know its 3:30 AM but i HAD to catch up on Manny's video before I went to sleep.
i absolutely love the end bloopers. also in light of Luke Perry passing away ive been watching Beverly Hills 90210.
Lmao omg this video was hilarious
Looove your vlogging parts!
I’m literally watching DuckTales rn (the 2017 version) and I don’t even care if you think that’s childish bc ITS AMAZING
The Umbrella Academy on Netflix
Need more vlogs!!!
1:10 me trying to flirt with my crush.
You crack me up. You are so funny.
Morii cuando dijo "basuraaa" 🗑🗑😂😂

If you haven’t watched it yet, watch American Horror Story it’s the best
It’s an almost perfect color match
Good girls 10 PM on Sunday on NBC. It’s a really good ass show and funny

You should definitely start doing more colorful looks, they look so good on ya 😊
literally always make my day i love you! 😂❤️❤️ i LOVED this video btw!
literally my FAV AND #1 youtuber because of the bloopers and i just love you! ❤️❤️❤️
The way Manny feels about the Nyx palette price is the same way I felt about my Estée Lauder foundation, I got it for $16, it also was on clearance at Ulta 😁😁
Manny I LOVE your commentary in your videos! You're so cute n funny!!  That eye look tho 😍 come thru NYX!
You always make the kaka makeup week Manny that’s why I love love you!
"The order" on netflix is such a badass show.! Check it out manny 😊
I live for the disney intro 🤩😂
I recreated this look while watching this ❤️
You should check out Target or TJMax's discount makeup
Ever since your CYO/thataylaa shootout I've started watching your channel. I have to say you're alot different now than your older videos and I'm here for it.
Omg I’m wanting that swear by it palette from nyx 😭 can’t believe you got it for $7 !
The concealer would give more coverage if you you put more than a small paint brush stroke, you are setting yourself up for failure
Haiiii sweeeeetieeesssss
Basura horchata😭tang ina! Maganda😭🙌😝
I’m I the only one who noticed the lines under his eye like near his check bones
The Disney channel thing you did!! I’m living
You had me dying the entire video hahaha, take us shopping with you more often!! 💕💕
Oh my goodnesss Manny this video has me dyyyinnnggg 😂😂😂❤️
“HEY don’t be cutting me off” LMAO A MOOD 😂
Love the Casey Frey reference 😂😂
Binge on anime! Watch Madoka Magica if you haven't watched it yet♥
Love you manny ! It’s currently 12:30 am and I am dying of laughter lol
Watch the magicians or the order 💖
Did he say he feels like a makeup artist....😂He IS a makeup artist!
“Is it anything to go tell your mom about” ME AF 😂😂😂
Can we get at least one Manny in the car Vlog. Just Manny driving either alone or with a guest, yelling, screaming and reacting to traffic madness. Maybe a video trying to find a parking spot in the Costco parking lot at peek time when that old granny jumps out of the car and runs to  the parking spot he is a out to park in. Manny out sass a grandma.
“If it’s used I get um salmonella” 😂😂 I’m deceased
Manuel once again, I stan.
I was dying lmao 😂
8:43 😂
Mary poppins 😂😫
The fact that manny still has to say if you don’t like me don’t watch me bothers me wtf is wrong with people who would hate this Angel 😇
Recomiendas esos productos mi amog
There aren't many views or comments on his latest videos ... Just noticed
I have used ulta bronzer and I didn’t like it and I love ur videos
Basura-horchata  basura-horchata    jajaja lo ame

CAR VLOGS I FUCKING LIVE FOR IT😍😍 and OMMMG I love the white background with your bright shirt!! You should try the infallible stick foundation without that first foundation because it’s really, really good! I also wasn’t surprised by how amazing the NYX eyeshadow palette was because NYX is just AMAZING
My favorite thing about this video was seeing piccalo on your shirt 💘
"THE TALENT JUMPED OUT"😝
Probably one of the best/most funny video you’ve put out in a while. Keep it up! 💕😊
i tried an eyeshadow palette from Ulta's brand and had an allergic reaction and i haven't used their brand since cause I don't trust it.
MANNY im in desperate need of a new everyday foundation, what would a full-coverage queen like u recommend? 

if any one has any recommendations pls send them my way!  x
Omg your face when you swatched the second highlighter! I died 😩😂😂😂
Who else tried to do the thing with your two pointer fingers that he did and failed??? Wtf how do his fingers move like that 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
I love you manny
What powder did you use?????
“You guys I’m literally embarrassed by how I look now” LMAOOO so much drama

I remember when I started to watch your videos long ago and I thought they were super good. Fell in love with your reviews and after all the drama last year, I see your videos are having the same good vibe as when I started watching your channel. Never unsubscribed cuz I knew nobody is perfect and you would come back. Wish you the best Manny with your brand and your life ❤❤ ME GUSTA MUCHO!!
Manny do you remember that video where you recreated kylie's Vogue makeup? Omg  would love to watch one of those. About kylie or any other celebrity. Love yaaaaa!!

Hello Manny! YOU COULD MAKE THIS TEENAGERS DREAM COME TRUE 🥺🥺🥺🥺I’m a teenager from Bangladesh who has a deep passion for makeup. Unfortunately, aside from being a teenager who has to concentrate in her studies and can’t afford makeup, (let alone good quality makeup) it is EXTREMELY rare for my country to have good makeup for a reasonable price.  Hence, winning  this giveaway will keep me forever stocked and I can hopefully concentrate more in my studies🥺🥺

Everything looked so... Immature or Juvenile. Like initially I was like oh Sugar Rush is a collection geared towards preteen and teenage girls... made sense to me product wise and packaging. But then everything else before Mac was so teenybopper... is that just the Spring Vibes this year?

Is he narcissistic or something? He doesn’t even look at the camera, always looking at himself.

Hi Manny🙌🏼
California
Ig: @mrstdock1011
The highlight in the Emily palette was meant to be more subtle. She even said she tested it on her mother who is in her 70s to see how it looked on her more mature skin. The blinding super shimmer highlights might be cute on younger skin. They are not always as pretty on more mature skin. Emily herself does not go crazy with super blinding highlight these days. So the highlight in her colab totally makes sense. It isnt a "quality" issue. It is just intentionally not super intense.
Love you manny!!!!

You should have bought both sophdoesnails palettes, in my opinion they're both more attractive than Emily's, even the first one that has shimmery purple, green and petrol blue, but Soph's Extra Spice is even more attractive, more beautiful, the shades are way fucking better, the shimmers are bomb, TF Natural Love vs Semi Sweet, Natural Love has the best shimmers comparing to SS, but Soph's palettes have waaaayyy better quality. So proud of Soph about what you said about her here <3
Would it be my life dream? Aaaaaa ❤️❤️❤️

Manny, I’ve been watching you for a long time, but this is the first time I’ve commented. You have been through an obvious transformation - lately especially you’ve been shouting out other creators and smaller infleuencers and it is SO refreshing. I’m so happy to see how you’ve pushed through major adversity. You are a pleasure to watch - it feels like I’m just hanging out with a friend!! So thank you!

GIVEAWAY! 💙❤️ 
I’m from Arizona! Love you manny 🌙
Their concealer is my absolute #1 favorite of all time. & So cheap. Shades that are lighter than c5 do a better job of concealing blue & dark circles IMO. They're a bit more pink so it helps. But not too pink that it's noticable. I definitely think it's a dupe for shape tape.

Full face of one brand was fun - I've long wondered what their loose powders were like.  Watching you open that jar of loose powder was the perfect of marriage of a Jerry Lewis doing makeup.  I literally giggled aloud, thank you!  I've never tried Becca.  You can contact me via my name at gmail.  Thank you for all of your time, hard work and enthusiasm to give us fun content.  Hope the move to your new place is going well.   :-)

Manny!  I have an idea for a new video.  I always wondered how you guys go about picking the winner for your give-a-ways, like what is the process?  Is it just random?  And do people really win this stuff?  Maybe have a few winners on and do something fun with them.  Just an idea for new content . . .

I love your way to give your opinion. I am from Guatemala. Ig dayanna_arrcou
The problem with Emily’s “needs” palette is the fact that it includes a blush, bronzer and highlighter. This is an issue in my opinion because it only caters to a very select group of people. that’s my issue with any palette that advertises as like a “good for all over the face had everything you need in palette”. And I’ve watched Emily for years and she really doesn’t acknowledge the dark skin crowd. So 🤷🏽‍♀️ plus she got all butt hurt when tati said shhe didn’t like the palette on her channel because she has a larger audience. Distasteful

Hi Manny! I have a quick skin/makeup question if you don't mind answering it! So the question is my skin gets really irritated under my nose: peeling, getting red and separating when I put foundation on top of it! I was wondering if you had any suggestions on how to fix this or if there is a foundation i should try that would help with my problem! Thank you so much <3
Makeup revolution is my fav! Definitely more affordable than any other brand for really good quality products. Only foundation that doesn’t really dry my face out in this Alaska weather. 

Ig: Meliarojopaz
Manny, Im not sure if this is how I get entered for your GA, but, I hope so because I love makeup and have little to zero income to buy it! I would probably cry happy tears if you sent me some!

Manny.... 😳 omg lol did you really just try to make a joke about it not being a doe foot but a deer foot? 😳 Like uhhh a doe is a female deer. If you’re trying to say it’s big that doesn’t really work. Comparing a fawn to a deer or doe might but a fawn is still just a young deer. 😂

I’ve never really understood why people compared the Makeup Revolution Concealer to Shape Tape. I never got that vibe. It did slightly remind me of the NARS liquid concealer. I do also enjoy using a darker shade to contour. I found the darker shade dries down A LOT faster. But, overall, for a couple bucks, it’s hard to pass up. 

Love your channel, Manny. & if you feel like giving the Khloe x Malika to me, I’d be extremely appreciative. Khloé is my love. Pesher01 on insta.

Hey Manny... So, about the packaging of the eyebrow pomade... Uhhhh, pretty much all brow pots look like that, looks like Revlon, L'Oreal, Anastasia, all of them. Black cap, clear glass pot. How else would they package a brow pomade? Love you anyway.
I hated that lip kit it was so streaky and sheer

That blue color tho!!! Dang that was stunning!!! Do yo thang girl!!!!
Okay I love the Manny Outbursts "Do I like that its sticky? NO!" 

Next I want Manny tries Mary Kay then tries to fend off the Mary Kay rep as they try to sell you more makeup before yoh get the first round of makeup you bought. "Everyone needs 4 extra bottles of foundation that is almost a good match for your complexion. You need this way to orange peach rouge. Well yes it applies bright orange but eventually you won't nice because your eye rods will go blind to that particular color."
I got an eyeshadow pallet from Revolution Makeup a couple weeks ago (not the Emily one) but I absolutely love it!! If you want a pallet with great mattes and shimmers I would definitely recommend one of their regular eyeshadow pallets because all of the shades are stunning!!
It's too funny. On the 3rd I was in Ulta, I bought a morphe M439, now it's my favorite foundation brush.
I’m not even half way through the video and I almost woke my baby up from laughing so hard. 😂

Oh, he’s staying on YT, ugh god why😂😂
I literally came here because I thought you were moving on in life. Too bad
He's moving because those greek goddess palettes flopped.
K A R M A .....the new pallet from luner beauty :D
shes going bROKE. all those love bracelets catching up with you. 🤔
These hate comments😂😂 I barely watched just read the comments the whole time 😂😂
Let's just all drop the hate and shade . Hes already like.. yeah no words xD.
That was the most disappointing clickbait ever 🙃
obviously had to keep laura lee’s 99c palette 😅
yeah tired of living in Hollywood and not being able to pay for your house are not the same thing

Lots of love and good luck from northern Norway! Some of the makeup I really want to try is a bitch to get a hold of, and if I find someplace that ships here, the customs and tax and shipping is insane! Often it gets much more than the product itself 🙄👎

Couldn’t imagine living in Hollywood, here in Australia it’s about as mythical as Narnia.

Anyhow, makeup that doesn’t rob my bank account sounds like a great thing for me, you know? 😉

I get you, I recently had my baby girl and when I was 3 months Prego I moved out of my parents house with my Baby girl's dad and it was such an emotional and learning experience for me, I felt nostalgia and a little sad because I was leaving the nest lol and I had to learn to be completely Independent within a few months before my baby was born but it was also exiting to see what life had in stage for me and living this new chapter with my new little family!

As somebody with anxiety/depression I ALWAYS freak out over any change. Any. Even small as hell like starting a new job. Moving down the street would make me freak out. My son changing his teacher and class for 1st grade after Kindergarten gives me depression. So I think moving away from a house I've been in for 3 years and to a different town would really shake me. BUT without change there would never be growth so kudos to you for forcing yourself to a better situation for you!

The memories is what gets me. We’ve lived in our current home for 3 years, and we plan on buying this house soon, because this is the house my youngest babies came home to. Where my daughter said her first words and took her first steps. Where my son learned his colors, numbers, shapes and letters. I’d be so heart broken to leave here! 😭

You're lying. You're not tired of living in Hollywood. I have been in school for 3 years to be a psychologist and I can see right through this video. Why lie? You'd get a lot more respect if you just said you're too broke to live there anymore.

I'm so sorry that people are coming for u....I personally loved ur palette. It was beautiful and gorgeous on my skin tone. I will continue to support u. Good luck with ur move and just take a deep breath....let it out slowly...put ur head up...smile and keep going. Even through all ur tears just stay the course, things will work themselves out. I personally think ur talented and don't let people discourage you. You are very much still loved ♥️♥️😁🙃😊

Sorry, I’ve been out of the  YouTube loop for a while now. I just now saw this video and freaked out because I thought it was going to be you saying goodbye to us. I was ready to scream and cry!!! Sooooo soooo happy you aren’t leaving us. I can understand the sadness of moving. I lived in the same house for 8 years. And then I was hired on at a much better job with much better pay....but in a totally different state. I moved from the Northern Panhandle of WV to western KY. Talk about a very emotional move! That was rough! But...after being in KY for almost 7 years, I am so happy to say that if I were given the chance to make the decision again.... I would make the same one!!! Best of luck Manny!! I’ll be praying for you. Well I guess that answered where I’m from. LMAO Now where to reach me....Instagram samantha_k1127
Ugh I only clicked this cause I thought we was leaving youtube  -_-
I'm so sad. I thought he was quitting YouTube. Was thinkin' "finally".

Hi Manny! So happy for you! Positive vibes and energy sent your way for a smooth transition ✌🏼Change is always very scary and nerve wracking! My husband lost his job literally a week before Christmas, we were already living away from our family, so we decided to pack all our shit and go with our 2 children and move back where our family is. It was so hard and I was so scared of the change, but we definitely made the right decision. I’m sure you know you did, too. You will always have those memories in your old house to fall back on, but now you get the pleasure of making new ones 😉 I lived in Austin, TX and now moved back to Clarks Summit, PA where it’s so stinkin cold 🥶 good luck! You’ll do great!!!! IG: jessied4219

You got me with that clickbait, I actually thought you were saying goodbye to YouTube!! Way to make a girl’s heart drop to her toes! But I’m so glad you’re doing a powder purge!! I love when influencers like yourself show that they go through their products every once in a while and donate their undesirables. There are people out there that are unable to express to you their appreciation for your donations! Kudos my friend 💕 p.s. I hope the move went well! Take some time for some r&r if you can girl, that shit’s taxing

Congrats Manny!!! I just moved into my first house m in January too and it’s definitely tough but it’ll be so worth it! You’re going to THRIVE in a new environment and I am so happy for you. I’ve been watching you since 2014 and I have loved you ever since. I watch your videos for tutorials and just when I’m getting ready in the morning because I love them! I live in Small town Springfield NH with my fiancé and two dogs. I’m still in college getting my associates so I can’t afford to buy makeup all the time. Well anyways, my Instagram handle is @ry_slaayy and I’m also a follower! Good luck with your move Manny and I’ll see you in your next video! MUA 😘

Moving to a new home is kind of like taking off a full face of (flawless) makeup: It's emotionally very challenging to let go of something you've put your heart and soul into, but you let it go because you knowing that there are far better things to come <3                                  Insta: lilfrootloop

LOVE you so much! You have so me so much you have no idea I have been struggling with deciding what I want to do, I ended up leaving the university I was at and decided to come home at a local Community college. Which has def been a huge huge transition from being with people all the time at college and now living with my parents when my best friends are all over the map at different schools. Your videos have helped me with not feeling alone (no joke lol I have zero friends home) and you helped me find my love in makeup and being creative!

Congrats on your new home. NEW beginnings are always a little scary, but 3 years in that house have tons of good times and they were all made possible because you moved into it from your last place and began a new. I hope you'll do a help me decorate my new house video. That would be fun.

All 3 of the highlight pallettes were kidnapped by my helpers Mothers once they got them home LMFAO and they won't give them back!!! They finally agreed that they would share them. I almost pee'd myself when they told me.

Thank you for reading it if you get the chance to and have a great day/evening ☺️
Congrats on the upgrade! It might be scary, but like you said in the beginning, you need a calmer place and that’s exactly what you can make in the new house. Change like this is good because it’s like having a do over. You can do everything differently in the new house if you want, and make it exactly how this house wasn’t. You’ll do great kiddo! ❤️❤️ p.s. hope you’re donating to project beauty share after watching Taylor’s videos! 😏😂

Manny! Thank you so much for sharing about our fundraiser and supporting Project Beauty Share, can’t tell you how much we appreciate the support and donation! ❤️  this was awesome.
So stoked that you mentioned thataylaa!! Her channel is so extremely underrated! I love her soo much!! 💕❤️
‘Can you ovulate’ that’s definitely it 😂😂
Thank you so much for bringing awareness to this. It truly is so important. My son and I staid at a Dove's shelter for a month, when he was 4 months old. I got both of us away from his terribly abusive "father", and I had nothing. One of the workers took me to their supply room and let me pick out whatever makeup I needed. It meant everything. It helps lift up beaten and battered women and makes them feel good about themselves for the first time in God knows how long. Thank you, Manny. So much. 💚
Yes you should do a whole face with CYO!!! Create Your Own???????
Omg the employee was my boyfriend!! 😍😂
First time viewer. I've been a baeritto on Taylor's channel for a long time. Love your support, Manny!
I died when the foundation cap fell on your straw 😂😂
You really changed back to the manny we all fell in love with at first! Love your new content and including other YouTubers so much ❤️
the color looks so good on manny. very true to his skin tone. we need more of this energy in 2019
I love Thataylaa got the recognition but omg it’s hard enough to get CYO in my shade as it is. I don’t know about the other shades but 101 is consistently out of stock. Walgreens, CYO, step up the production, stock more!! But srsly Thataylaa is my complexion go too. I trust her so much. She’s one of the few YouTubers I feel confident is being as real and unbiased as possible. It’s impossible to let go of all preconceived biases but Thataylaa is one of the best at doing it.
That actually does look so smooth and shiny. Your skin looks like glass.
Hey Manny,
CYO has a matte foundation in a tube.  Maybe you could try that one.  It might work better for you.  Love the eye look!
Is it bad I giggle...with him....??
I love you shouting out Thataylaa! She's so awesome. I love her videos.
Yes please to a full face of CYO. I’ve never heard of the brand and I’m sooo intrigued!! The coverage and finish on that foundation 🤤🤤🤤. Brb running to purchase this.
"O is a hard letterrrrrrr" lmaooooo
UMMMMM that Eye Look tho!! Sicking, Manny you need to make a Video recreating that Eye look.
Tell me why the packaging looks way better than the Morphe one and its way cheaper 🌚
Do a whole C.Y.O video. Those metallic eye shadows looked so pretty.
Is it just me or would Manny be an amazing dad I could imagine him with a kid beating there face to the gods at age 2 😂
To be continued ...Is that a hint
I can't believe your store actually had it?! CYO is soooooo goooood!!! And thank you for shouting out thataylaa!!! 🖤🖤🖤 Also, why am I seeing this a month late?!
I think what makes thataylaa extra special is she doesnt boast about it, she doesnt over exaggerate the fact that shes apart of an organization. It makes her really humble, and more youtubers should be like that. Shes awesome, and funny im watching this now i just finished watching her 15 days of foundation round up this morning and now im watching this lol
Whooooooo is that girlllll I seeeeeeeeee! Whos from the early squad?!!?
Is it CREATE YOU OWN??? CYO???

Sorry just watching it again and you just were talking about it.?
And yes you do look sickening!!!
Wish it was in Australia 🇦🇺
Is that the Walgreens on Vine and Sunset? I used to love that place when I lived on Beachwood, their cosmetics section is literally like Nordstrom’s! ❤️
The intro tho! 😂 Dead

Update: i commented before even watching the whole thing. I cracked up the whole video tho! 😂. On my lunch break in my breakroom laughing like an asshole. Im going to gt fired!!!!!! 😂
"answer correctly" im cryinggg!!!
Can we appreciate that the foundation DID NOT EVEN CREASE! Thataylaa always serving us the good stuff! Thanks for reviewing it on your channel, Manny :)
You just gained a subscriber for supporting my girl thataylaa ❤️
Maybe “CYO” stands for “create your own”. Like, crest your own look with our products 🤔🤷🏽‍♀️ just a shower thought 😂
PLEASEEEEEE do a full face in CYO! I am DYING to see what those eyeshadows really look like!!!!
Been following ThaTaylaa for years and I LOVE her. Thank you for highlighting her incredible work with Project Beauty Share!
Thataylaa is the best youtuber don’t @ me
You’re at the fancy Walgreens...😉
But your skin looks flawless after that initial application 😍😍😍😍
“Why does it look so beautiful?!” Ummmm MANNY YOU COULD WEAR A TRASH BAG AND IT WOULD LOOK BEAUTIFUL 😍
Literal gasp after the transition with your eyes done. Manny and the Amazing Technicolor Dreameyes.
The vlogging aspect of your latest videos has really piqued my interest! Please keep it up. I love your natural goofiness and the way you interact with people.
I saw CYO is Buy 2 get one free on Walgreens online.
Just for people watching I don't have dry skin, I have combo with an oily tzone and it isn't dewy on me at all. It's more satin and it lasts ALL DAY skin is so weird lol just didn't want people to think it was only for dry skin I have several super expensive foundations and this is my ride or die
I've been watching Taylor for FOREVER and I think it's so awesome that with someone with a platform of your magnitude is honoring her and all the hard work she puts into her YT by shouting her out and guiding viewers to her channel. Manny, this makes me love you so much more. Smaller YTs are still awesome and they deserve some recognition! 

Go Taylaaa! 💗💗💗
“C.Y.O Can you ovulate” 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀☠️ Lmaoooooo
Baerrito fam come through ❤️❤️
Can You Offer more shades? Oof 😖 It’s a little understandable considering it’s not a very popular brand.
Just here because Taylor had an instastory about it ..  thanks for the support Manny!! 🎉🎉💕
I have to say i am excited to see more from you. You are so sweet for supporting others in the beauty community.. And my god you are BEAUTIFUL
Why haven't I found you sooner?! New Subscriber! I love you already ❤
Loved that opening 😂😂 and I love Taylor’s 15 Days of Foundation! She puts so much work into the 15DOF and the charity work! I love that you’re donating, that’s amazing! 💖💖
Minute 9:50-Manny: "Can You..?.?." ---- 
Me: ORAL

My skin is also porcelain and I love the way this foundation makes your skin look like glass ✨👌🏻
Awww Manny, thank you so much for doing this video!! So lovely to bring more awareness for Taylor. I’ve been following her since about 30k, I absolutely love everything Taylor does for everyone, more so project beauty. With your following this will definitely get the word out even more for her. Donating what you have is fantastic-thank you. You’re a legend as much as Taylor. Xx
Cyo stands for “create your own”
Gotta says it again. Manny you seem so natural happy & just very much “yourself” lately . Very comfortable. I don’t know something’s diff & it’s great lol
Never heard of this foundation! But it looks FLAWLESS 💞
“CYO- Can You Ovulate!! I died and you brought me back to life!!🤣🤣🤣
And can I just say, that eye makeup was absolutely SICKENING 🤤🤤😍😍😍
"can you ovulate" 😭😭😅😂😂😂
Love you Manny making people feel beautiful is very humble!❤️ Especially Giving!🙏🏽 God Bless You!

your eye make up is unreal😍😍😍🔥
It stands for “create your own” lol i just had to look it up
CYO - Create Your Own ,,

C.Y.O - “can you ovulate?”
CYO

Such a great cause!!! Makeup can give you a little dignity. Can be a ray of sunshine when all your days seem very dark. 💕

Manny, dearest, we are going to NEEEED that eyeshadow tutorial 😍!!!
I just want to say I am in love with your Content lately, I’ve been watching you from when you used to do Little Sleepy and you’re back to the Manny I fell in love with ❤️
Iv been watching her for so long she definitely works sooooo damn hard so this is amazing to see you talk about her 💕💕 uhg my heart
Yes, I would love for u to do a full face of CYO, especially because this is one of the few brands that is in British drugstores as well as American ones. I would also love for u to review the new Zoella x Colourpop collection to see what u think about it! Love ur videos BTW💜
Create, colour, Call Your Own! 
Much love Manny! 💕😊 love the vlog videos

"Manny's for everyone." I love your sense of humor.! 
&& I love that you're helping support project beauty share. When I saw what Taylor was doing it for, it really opened my eyes that DV and homelessness, etc. Isn't as hidden as I thought. (I was in a DV relationship for to long, and was also homeless at one point). So of course I am going to donate. <3
I love watching your videos! they're always so entertaining, your personality is the BESSTTTT!!! much love <3

This was awesome! I love seeing you support a good cause, a fellow YouTuber, and also feature more affordable products. 👍💜👏
Was anyone else screaming CREATE YOUR OWN when he was trying to figure out what it stands for😩😂 it was on the counter😂😂
When you tried to make a thing out of “create the look you love” it reminded me of that meme 😭

I AM LIVING!!!! I love Taylor!!!! Ah!!
please do full face with CYO, i have been curious about their brand for the longest time and would love to see you review more of their product!
I have really oily Tzone but with matte primer and setting i last longer amd also you could mix a few frops woth another foundation and it works wonders.  Definitely worth the $6
Omg I died when the lid fell on your straw 😂😂😂😂
Please do a full video on the CYO makeup!!
Just found your channel! I’m hooked!  Great review but your vibe is the bomb 🤗
Love the “white chicks” reference. Dear Mr. Hampton 🤣🤣
Manny!! It's Witchcraft!! Lol😂😂🤣🤣❤❤
"O is a hard letter!" I live 😂😂❤️
I love how you come back to check in on the foundation with a full rainbow eye... Just super casual you know! Haha amazing.
OMFG “PuMp” NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD
Thataylaa and you are my favorite YouTubers so I’m kind of dying that you’re supporting her. Love you Manny ♥️
manny! i would love a tutorial on this eye look 😭
i love this foundation so much! what was the powder you used? I must have missed it if you said so. Great video and you make me laugh so much even when I'm ill 💕
I'm from L.A 🌃 we LIVE for Manny the Vlogger tho, yaaaas🙌🏻😁
Oh my gosh! "Can You Ovulate"😂
I. Love. Taylor. She’s a beautiful soul 🖤
Hi Manny! So nice what you did to promote 15 days of foundation. Love this video. 😘
Manny I love u ❤️❤️❤️ u always help everyone n i been watching for 2 years n I always got excited and learn from ur videos.
A pump 😭😂😂❤️❤️ that made me laugh hard lol
Loved this video. You are perfect and I would probably have a heart attack if I ever saw you in person 😂😍
I always try to order CYO life proof but it’s always sold out in the shade I would need. I love Taylor’s videos and her dedication to 15 days of foundation. I am always shocked that she doesn’t have more subscribers!
marcos would literally be my boyfriend😂😂
I love it! Also need a tutorial on that eye makeup 😍🥰💖
Did we ever find out what CYO stands for?!?! I like NEED to know!
Manny.... Thank you so much for raising awareness and helping people in need. As a survivor of domestic violence and now advocate, I was truly touched by this video. 

While I usually watch your videos within 30 seconds of you uploading them, I was unable to yesterday. But watching this was my first priority this morning 😍. I know you’ll probably never see this, but you should know how inspiring and amazing you are 🌙💕. You are such a wonderfully beautiful human. 

Thank you for being you!! 💕💕💕
Damn! I wish I worked at that Walgreens!! Everything always happens at that Walgreens.
I LOVE HER!!!!! I’m so glad you gave her a shout out! I’ve watched her for years ❤️
Good one for sharing about  project beauty share and the charities. You're the only one I've seen recommend it or talk about it and I think Taylor is doing such an awesome job helping, and with your audience hopefully so much more will hear about it. Thank you for showing your kindness Manny🙌💚
Your concealer seems a bit too light but I might be just talking out of my butt. Cyo foundation looks really good tho!  :)
Manny is the best. Thank you for bringing awareness to a good cause. I'm sitting her laughing when Manny keeps trying to figure out the name. C.Y.O. it's probably Create. Your. Own. Lol.
When the lid fell on your straw 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭 btw please do a full face of CYO! I haven’t heard of them but their makeup looked pretty cute so I’m intrigued! Love youuuu 😘😘😘😘😘
I feel the same after applying blush! Like...who's that girl 😚☺...shes cuuute!!
Yas full face of Can you ovulate products😂😂
Yes full face. Love your videos. Even my boys watch with me.
Need skincare tips from you 🤩
"can you ovulate?" 😂😂😂😂 Yeah and it fkn HURTS

Thank you for giving the shout out to Taylor.  I’ve been watching her for a year and love her.  15 days of foundation is the best!  Love love love ,
you’re the only beauty youtuber that makes me giggle. Lol 
I love watching you. ❤️❤️❤️
Holy shitsies Manny!!! Love how you are lifting another queens crown!
👑 ❤️
I am going to donate too. Thank you for spreading the word.
You should do a C.Y.O haul and a look using just C.Y.O
"O" is a hard letter 😭 I'm dying lmao
What have you been doing for your skin?!? It’s so smooth😍
C-Y-O literally create your own 🤣🤣🤣
So when do we find out what that powder you used was !? That was beautifulllll. That’s sooo shady know letting us know 😂
Wow- this whole vid just made me smile- and I just got off a 10 hour shift from a call center in advanced technical support for TV on Oscar night...that's saying a lot 😂😂🤣
Manny please a full CYO makeup look. I love you!
Manny....i love you and i love Thataylaa!! She helped me strive to find a foundation that actually worked for my skin and made me feel purdy :) and i threw out the stuff that didn't work for me finally!!    Manny have you made a dog picked my makeup ? I feel like your pup would be funny doing this if she hasn't yet.... am i right lol
You trying to figure out what CYO stands for! 😂😂😂
Full face of the brand please??? 💕💕
I love Taylor so much. I’ve been watching her for years. So glad you did this video and now you have a subscriber in me! ❤️❤️❤️
Omg!! “Can you ovulate”. Lol!!😂
Im loving all the vlogging youve been including recently
Create, colour, call it your own! 😊 Although Can You Ovulate.... LIVING 😭😂😭😂😭😂😭
I’m so glad you tried this foundation and I would love to see a full face of cyo also😊 you looked gorgeous!
When are you coming to NC???? Btw thank you for making this fundraiser known!! I love it and plan to donate!
The CYO matte foundation is just as good, but better for oilier skin!
Your singing voice 😍😍😍😍 replayed it so many times. You should do a video of just you singing about your makeup 😂😂 love you Manny
From Snapchat fam love you manny 💚❤️💜
Manny that eye look looks amazing 😉 your eyes stand out a lot 👌
Create Your Own....Look! Your eyes are STUNNING!
Please do a full face of CYO ! & I had never heard of this organization but am totally going to do whatever I can to help. Thank you for being you. ❤️
LIVING FOR THIS LOOK 😍😍. But thank you Manny for this. I guess I live under a rock and didn’t know about the donations for makeup. I will DEFINITELY be giving any makeup. I have so many products that didn’t work for me and are sitting from the first use! ❤️
Can you... Onomatopoeia?💀💀💀
i think it stands for create your own😂
Dude I swear, if I'm ever in a bad mood, good mood, whatever...you crack me up! Gosh, you would totally be the person I'd want to hang out with always😂 love you!
If I'm correct cyo. Stands for create your own
That end bit of you saying Yummy, had so many Rob Schneider the Hot chick vibes, it’s unreal. 😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cracking up at trying to figure out the o in cyo. 😂😂😂
Loved that you tried this and gave Taylor a shoutout! I love both channels! 💕
Your eye make up in this video is dope af!! Thumbs up on supporting good cause projects 👌🏼
Can you OVULATE 😂😂😂😂 you’re so cuteeeeeeee!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Omg the foundation lid falling on your straw 💀 your hilarious
This is such a side note but I wanted to say that lately manny you have been giving me these happy vibes and just so different in a great way. Idk regardless love this literally my favorite part is “ i love being sneaky” lol
Honestly though, I’ve been following Taylor since she had about 200k subs. And she has always been one of the most down to earth YouTubers that I’ve ever seen. To know that she is well over 700k and has been so gracious with everything makes me so happy. I’ve donated to Project Beauty Share strictly BECAUSE of her & what she stands for. Makeup is more than makeup if you can’t afford to buy it. In order to feel professional during a job interview. Or just having better self esteem all together. It’s just beautiful.. This is amazing. And I’m just so excited. Thank you manny, for giving her more light on how amazing she is.
Yesssssss please do a FULL producet review of the brand check out EVERYTHING of the line.
I love your personality 😚
But today! I was soakin it UP 💖💖 mm so adorable! Alllll about it today!! 💖💟💖 💟💋👑
Love that you did this Manny!!!!! You are awesome!
This is my HG foundation and it's gonna be forever sold out because of you. 😑
Taylor fans! Come join our Facebook fan group if you wanna be a part of a beautiful community of recommendations and uplifting baerritos! Just search “Thataylaa’s Baerrito Fam” on Facebook and send us a request to join! We’d love to have you! 😊
Need that eyeshadow tutorial asap😍💅
In a beauty world full of influencers putting out constant sponsorships, partnerships and ads, it’s refreshing to see videos/content being put out like this 🙌🏼
Thataylaa is amazing!
I loved this video! I want to see more first impressions of this brand!
Manny!!! Thank you so much for this video! Been wanting to try a new foundation and this one sounds like the perfect one for me! Besos from Texas! 💋
C.Y.O stands for Call your own, create your own, color your own. Loved seeing more drugstore makeup 😘
Crest your own??? 🤔😂
Flawless skin aside, that eye look though 😍😍
Okkkk yaassss i just looked this up... this is what C.Y.O stands for:
CYO stands for anything the customer wants it to stand for, such as “call your own,” “create your own” and “color your own.”
You’re awesome Manny! THIS is why I am a fan; you rock!
OMG, please do a full face of CYO!! 🔥
Manny, you are seriously the funniest 😂
Please do a video on this eye look😍😍😘😘
We stan a humble drugstore foundation beauty guru who stops for fan pics 😛
OMG!! I LUV @Thataylaa and 15 days of foundation. I've watched all 6 seasons!! She is sooo talented  and should have tons more subscribers. Thanks Manny for bringing awareness to @thataylaa and project beauty share!!!
Marcos is awesome my husband calls u the beautiful man and he knows not to bother me when I watch u he got me ur entire goddess collection
I also love Taylor and her mission!  You should try the CYO matte foundation, it's also bomb!
I LOVE WALKING THRU THE STORES W YOU LMAO KEEP VLOGGING !!
Fuuuucccckkkkk personally if I saw Manny at Walgreens I'd be talking about it for the rest of my life
Get a reusable straw Manny...were trying to save the planet. 😅😁🤗
Foundation looks good, you def should do a full face of their products.
Manny tfs i have very dry skin so I will diffently try this foundation peace/Love
OMG!! Manny your eyeshadow looked absolutely impeccable!! Keep up the great work, you are a huge inspiration and you are just amazing at what you do!!
Omg thanks for featuring Taylor and her cause!! She is the foundation testing queen👸 but fo real tho I NEED you to do a video on this eye look for me please?! And I just want to add that Taylor loves to use this foundation to mix with other dryer/matte long lasting foundations so it makes them more wearable for her dry skin so I think any skin type could use this foundation even just to mix their perfect concoction. Plus it's only 6 doll-hairs!
DO AN EFFING TUTORIAL ON THAT EYE LOOK HUNNIE DANG 👀👀👀
“O is a hard leEtteErrrR” “Can you Onomatopoeia” 😂😂😂😂😂
I love you manny you are the best 😘❤️ you mastered this look like you always do
Can you ovulate? 🤣😂 im dying!
Please do a tutorial of the eyeshadow look you have on. I love it😍😍
If I saw Manny singing into a mirror at the store...girl that’d be the best day of my LIFE 😂😂💕
You seem so much more real now. Happy for you!
I love her and I was super excited to see this! ❤️
Only watched the intro so I could hear someone shout out my girl ThaTaylaa!
Manny those eyes 🔥🔥🔥 gorga 🤣
No offense, but Taylor has been my number one youtuber for many years. Thank you, Manny, for featuring her. The only problem is that the CYO is my holy grail foundation, so now MORE people are going to know about it.... LOL!!  Also, thank you for being so generous with your donations to Beauty Share. If you guys want to find out more about the organization, go to Taylor's channel, Thataylaa, and look for the videos where Taylor visits the Beauty Share warehouse.
P.S. There are some good CYO products, but there are many duds unfortunately!
MANNY Im going to need longer videos!!! okay?! Love ya!!!
Marcos at Walgreens 😍♥️
Love it Manny❤️ ! C.Y.O = create your own ?? Just a guess haha
Not "haggard"! Lmfao. Why am I already cracking up 30 sec into the video?! 😅
This was a beautiful tribute, and stunning way to highlight a Project Beauty Share!  I'm loving the vlog, and great job to the "anchor of the moment" Manny - - LOVED how you "threw" the segment over, for the vlog.  Manny, your content has been fantastic video, after video!  You bring me so much joy, especially when it's on a day when it's hard to get out of bed.  You lighten my day, and help me forget that my body is in constant pain.  Bless you my friend!   :-)
“Can you , onomonapeia ?” 😂 I love you manny
Omg i actually shared her video to you. I follow you through everything because you are hilarious beautiful and generously warm hearted to take this on xxxxxx
Love everything about this video!!! So awesome Manny!! ♡ youuu!!
Lovvveeeeee thataylaa 💕💕💕
I think CYO stands for "CALL YOUR OWN", or "CREATE YOUR OWN"
Manny on the field is falling apart 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this video!! You’ve been keeping me going while I’ve been housebound 😭
Yesss more people need to know about Taylor! Manny is right, we need more people like her!
Manny you always look Georgeous! Love the eye look you slayed it!!
Taylor is my favorite beauty guru!!! This made me so happy!!! I’ve been dying for this foundation as I have dry skin and love dewy foundations but NO WHERE IN MY STATE HAS IT!!! But like this made me thrilled for you to mention her and try it!
Girl, you’ve never stared ”straight” at anything in your LIFE 😂👋
This intro was everything! Love you Manny ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg ! Im going to attempt creating this look again i love but i am a full time mom that i cant even do my make up  anymore 😭💗
You are so gorgeous and that eye look?  Love!
waking up from a bombass nap to find Manny doing a drugstore foundation review when I’m broke & need a new foundation is just perfect 🤩 yes 😂🤩
I just love watching your videos.... Natural and hilarious ;)
You have to do a tutorial on that eye look!!!!! Lyl ♥️♥️😍😍😍😘😘😘😍♥️♥️😍😍😘🥳🤩🤩🥳🥰🥰♥️😍😘🥰🥳
Please do a full face with C.Y.O makeup!!! I need to see other products from this brand, especially the foil shadow you showed!! Ps love you Manny!!!
As someone who has super dry skin, I appreciate this review.  Yay, a foundation under $10 to try. Thanks! :)
C.Y.O means "call your own" and/or "color your own." Love you!
I have this foundation and it's incredible 😍❤️
Thanks for this video Manny... now my foundations going to be out of stock!!!🙄😂
Yasss full impression on C.Y.O 🙌🏼
Love Taylaas channel - so happy you mentioned her
Manny, you are the queen of no audio these days. Get it together my baby. 😂
Can you OWN it! 🙌🏻⚡️
Also, I don't powder with this foundation! just a tiny bit on my undereyes and thats it! and it does last all day. I also have dry skin so theres that... 😉
I love how supportive you are of good causes!!!!❤️. Your the best❤️
Love CYO!!! It also makes a good mixing foundation! It's very smoothing! And if you have a foundation that is too matte for your liking, mix a little CYO with it!!!! Perfection!
WE NEED A TUTORIAL ON THAT EYE LOOK 😭😍
Be warned this stuff sells out constantly...
The odd numbers have a yellow undertone
The even numbers have a pink undertone.

Project Beauty Share collects personal hygiene products too!  I used to work at a battered women’s shelter and ladies would come in with NOTHING.  Donations of soap, deodorant, and oral care items help to give dignity to a survivor. Thank you Manny for bringing this video to the masses.
They have a matte foundation for the ones with oily skin! Full face CYO!!
What are you wearing on your eyes Manny? 😍

I am so happy Taylor is getting recognition! I've been watching her for over 2 years, and I am obsessed with her. I trust her reviews and most of the makeup (ok all) I buy is from her recommendation. She's such a hard worker and truly inspirational! Baerrito here!!!
Omg 7:51 🤣🤣🤣
Damn Manny you sit around the house like that? I guess I need to take a page from your book‼️
This honestly was amazing that you spread Taylor's video and her project and used your platform for good. Good for you.
How awesome to bring attention to such an amazing cause!!!
This is so amazing! You two are two of my favorites and only ones I watch when I come on YouTube! You guys are doing amazing things for people. ❤️🙌🏼
Can You Ovulate! Lol. Manny out in the field, thank you Manny in the studio! I died lol.
Omg your eye look at the end, I’m so obsessed. Please please please do a tutorial 😍 also I’m really loving the vlog aspect that you’ve been incorporating into your videos lately!l
Having the vlog parts really takes me back to when I first started watching you years ago. I love it!! I feel like my fave manny is back
Ok so I need to find myself a Marcos
Yassssss Manny!!!!! So happy you’re talking about Taylor!!! Everyone go follow her! She has become one of my absolute favorites! Especially because she has dry skin like me! This foundation is always out of stock and now it will definitely be gone 🤣
CYO= create your own(?) 😝😊
Can you ovulate 🤣🤣
Love how he says “it’s $6!!” like 50 times cause he is so shocked and he wants to make sure we know how shocking that is! You are too cute!
what if CYO stands for Create your own, ya know like create your own look, idk 😂
Yay I'm so happy you did this video Manny!
@thataylaa is my favorite makeup guru to watch! And CYO is my favorite foundation ❤️❤️❤️
Manny....you got your M O J O back!
Hahahha ok so maybe C.Y.O .... create your own ??? 
You kill me 😂 unfortunately living in good ol igloo Canada we probably don’t even have the  damn brand 🙄🙄🙄🙄
You have a really good singing voice!
As soon as you saw you blending it I kneed that it was going to look beautiful on you! I want to try it now!!!
Your content just keeps getting better and better 😍 so proud of how far you’ve come! Loved this video especially! I’ve been watching Taylor for YEARS and I’m so glad you mentioned her here, she’s amazing! And love the added vlog as well. Defffffff A++++++
Omg manny....this is amazing! Taylor works so hard on this and I’m tearing up that you made this video to support her and this project she works so hard on.
I've never watched one of your videos. But I LOVE Taylor. And just wanted to say your a class act to help her. 🏆 I also thought you were pretty entertaining! 😅
I have dry skin and this foundation is amazing xoxoxo
First time watching your channel and I already love you wtf.
Me muero!!! Can You Ovulate? 😂😂😂
Ummm... Can you please do a video showing us how you did the eye look in another video please ma'am?! Love you Manny
I grew up in a cult.  I was not allowed to wear any type of cosmetics.  My immediate family and I got out of that cult when I was 13.  I slowly gained interest in more mainstream things and eventually my friends pushed me to discover makeup.
It was amazing.
Having that makeup empowered me through a very hard time in my life and eventually my Mom gained interest.  It’s been a year since we left the town that was largely associate with years of mental abuse.  We use makeup to remind ourselves that we took that little part of the day to take care of ourselves, to do something for ourselves.  
Do not underestimate the power of makeup.  It can do so much for people in tough situations.
My Mama and I adore makeup and I doubt we’re going to stop wearing it anytime soon.
Stop making these videos so long!!!! 10 minutes would have been so much more appealing
Please do a full face of CYO makeup. I've seen it at Walgreens but I've never heard anyone say anything about it so i didn't want buy anything.
“Manny’s for everyone.” YES GIRL
Full face of C.Y.O. yes please!!! I've been curious about this line for a while. I will be donating to Taylor's fundraiser, thank you for supporting her Manny!!!! You're the bomb. 💋❤😍🤗
Manny you are always pretty and Beautiful
I ❤️ Thataylaa! Collab video in the future?

Omg I love that you shared all the info about Taylor and 15 days of foundation. She is one of my favorite youtubers and she works so hard and has such a beautiful heart. I love her. You’re so wonderful.
Thank you for bringing attention to a subject not many are wont to be talking about. Taylor & Project Beauty Share are amazing. 
As a single mother who all had come out from underneath the tyranny of my extremely abusive exbf, I applaud those who not only speak for themselves, for those who cannot & those giving a microphone to all. Thanks. I lived in a women's & children's shelter because of my ex who not only hurt me & did not let me wear makeup, but who did much worse to my children. As we make it through our lives, our growth, our healing pathways I'm grateful to people for their help, their support & compassion. 
Thank you.
Marcos and his girlfriend are LITERALLY me and my boyfriend 🥰🥰🥰🥰 we love you Manny!!!
Tell mE WHY I JUST WENT TO WALGREENS TODAY AND WATCHED THIS AFTER. If I knew this was a thing I would have picked one up 😭
Your everythinggggg 😍😍😍😍
Ok but this eye look is EVERYTHING 
E V E R Y T H I N G.!
Manny yaaassss! I love you and applaud you for using your large platform to help spread the word of project beauty share! Thataylaa has an amazing heart and when people use their platform for helping others, we are making the world a better place one step at a time ❤️
Loved the video and the message that you spread about Project Beauty Share, I think Taylor is awesome for starting that.
On another topic the eye look WHERE IS THE VIDEO ON THAT LOOK??? 
Thank you Manny LYSM 💜💋💜
You kept trying to figure it out and I went on the website- and it just says “create your own” “color your own” “call it your own” lol 😂 so I hope that helps. Love you manny!!! ❤️❤️
Beautiful inside and out. Love you Manny ❤️❤️
My favourite foundation in so long I use shade 101 & it is life xx
“$6 magic” 😍😍😍 

Manny I’m not sure if it says on your receipt but if your products you buy at Walgreens is open or you didn’t like it. Some stores allow returns on make up.
You're one of the kindest ppl!! Always spreading good vibes☝🏻😁
Did anyone else see him hit the light in the Walgreens. When he was picking out the foundation. ps I love you manny

Notification squad ❤️❤️❤️

“Manny’s for everyone”💞
I think it’s so amazing that it’s more of a norm for boys to wear makeup. People are finally becoming more accepting.
I wonder if you add the urban decay velvetizer powder to it to make it more matte?!?!?!? Hmmmm
I actually researched the brand and CYO stands for Call it Your Own. I’m obsessed with this brand - there values are awesome 🦄
Thank you SO much for bringing attention to Taylor’s cause. It means so much to all of us baerritos and I know it means the world to Taylor. I also love this video, you had me cracking up the entire time 😹🖤🌯🖤
Manny, there is a matte C.Y.O foundation as well...please review
i literally LIVE for the bloopers 😭😭😭
Omg the eye look is gorgeous!
cyo- create your own

This was such a great video Manny it just made my heart happy I'm so happy we all get to watch you grow!

I lost my dad and something about your videos truly make me happy and bring me joy. thank you Manny and much love as always. Someday i will get my hands on your eyeshadows maybe but mom and student first! 💋💋💋💋

Can we please se the tutorial on this eye make up??❤️GORGEOUS
You should do the mystery box
Bitchhhh we all know you was high as a kite in this 🤣

*RUNS TO WALGREENS TO TRY CYO*
This is such a amazing video 💜💜💜 & omg I'm in love with the look you created it 🤗😍🤗😍🤗
I don’t comment often...like ever 😆 but I just love watching your channel! You make me laugh so hard love it!!
Just wanna say i think your awesome manny thank you for being so giving and just carrying about others. I love ya and i live for your videos
Taylor is an amazing person thank you for mentioning her and project beauty share in this video ❤️
the vlogs are such a nice edition to the videos!! So much love in my heart for you Manny!
Coming from Thatayla’s channel ❤️ So excited!
Picturing you just hanging around the house making a sandwich in those bomb ass eyes SSHOOOOOOOOK, thank you for sharing and thanks tayla for what you’re doing ✨
Create your own,....look... i found myself screaming at the laptop bc of this
I can’t believe I’ve never heard of this brand!?! That foundation looks soo beautiful, super dewy is exactly what I look for in a foundation & for only $6 is freakin awesome!! Definitely gonna pick this up to try out! 👍😊
HAHHAHAHAHA i love this videoooooo. And so cool that ur donating
Please do a full face of CYO!
I’m oily but i mixed Cyo with the covergirl clean matte bb cream! I love the combo!!✨✨
My skin is super dry with this cold that I need this foundation ASAP , it looked so pretty 😍😍😍🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 ... I need a tutorial on this eye look please 😱😱😱😱😱🙏🏼
Manny potentially coming out with a loose powder?!!😍
YESSSSS I love thataylaa
I’ve got combination skin that leans a little oily during the warmer months and I’ve found that I can make dewy foundations work by baking/super setting my face with powder and using an oil control primer. If I use matte foundation it cakes up so badly on me and creases like a motherf****r lol 😂
Thanks for helping Taylaa!!!  Love her channel and yours of course!!!!!!💜
Full face Wal-Mart haul 👏👏 only place around me to buy it
When I say that eye look made me GASP-
CYO 
Create Your Own, maybe 🤔
This foundation lasts ALL DAY for me
I don’t have that brand at my Walgreens WHY
LOVE @thataylaa she’s amazing 
CYO mixed with Estée Lauder Double Wear is AMAZING 💋
Your so great manny love watching your videos your awesome manny 😍😍😍😘😘😘
Yes! I love Tay!!! And 15 days of foundation Great video! !!
FOR SOME REASON... you really resembled Paul Rudd in this video
That foundation HONESTLY  looks good on you 😺😼😸😻
Thanks MANNY! I will head out to Walgreens but shit fml
I’m hella oily....😫 u did ur makeup hella bomb 💣
Honestly this looks flawless on you 😍😍😍
If you are dry, combo, or normal skin, you will definitely love this foundation. I personally have dry, textured skin and I was very surprised at how it sat on my skin and evened everything out. Since my breakouts are at a minimum, I like to do a single layer, but once it's more humid I'll be able to build it up more.
Yes I love Thataylaa! I’m so happy you love her too! My two faves yes 😭
Manny!! How bout ' Can You Own This!'  Lol.... This vlog is too good & am so happy with this charity
Omg when manny drooled it made me laugh so hard I’m crying 😂
I'm here from the Baeritto fam! ❤❤❤
You're awesome for this :) taylor is the best too!

Manny...... Thataylaa is one of my most favorite youtubers ever. I trust her opinion and the works she does is uhmazing!!!!! I am so glad that you dedicate this video to her and her work!!!! You may also want to check out Allie Glines! She is also uhmazing and calm and beautiful and does amazing work!
That foundation is GORGEOUS!!!!!!
It’s really funny your trying to figure out what cyo stands for, when the brand says cyo stands for whatever you want it to stand for. Their whole brand revolves around creating the look you want, even the name. 😌😌
You look like Tyler Hoechlin:D
Sickening 👌🏼
Online Walgreens says its $7 🙄
Y’all so darn beautiful 💕✌🏻😊
I love you even more now this is very sweet Manny!!! I watch & love Taylor as well!! Ur both so amazing ❤️

Cyo stands for Create your own

She’s amazing!!!
“Call your own, create your own , color your own. It’s beauty on your terms “ 

Had to google it! Was way to curious lol
You should do top foundations for oily skin .... I am sooooooo oily and i am really interested to see what you recommend especially because you know the struggle 😩😩😩
manny babe it's "create your own"
Please do a full face of C. Y .O makeup
The contour stick and the single eye shadow shade are great
I just ordered 3 shades. On the Walgreens app it was buy 2 get 1 free!!! Gooooooo!!! lol
Hi okay I’m glad you did a review on this I’m trying it now. Six dollars, okay YES.
Yes do a full face of that brand
It stands for create your own C.Y.O
Can you please do a full face of the brand please
You should do a look using only makeup from sallys Beauty supplies!!!
I literally went in search of the foundation but they didn’t have my color 😩
We want that eye makeup tutorial please 😭❤️
MANNY GOD DAMNIT! I love you 😭🥰 can we get a tutorial on those eyes? &&&&& what did u use to prime your skin? Would a mattifying primer change your mind at all? Xoxo
“Only $6 dollars”🤦🏻‍♀️😆
offend, obliterate lmao
Love that throughout the whole video you’d rather guess what c.y.o meant rather than just googling it! “Can you ovulate?” 😂
Love the drugstore reviews and combined with a great cause it's a win/win.
Please do full face of cyo😍
You are such a gorgeous man
That eye look ! 🎨😍😍🔥
“O IS A HARD LETTERRRR” 😂😂
I love all ur videos ur such a inspiration 😍❤️
I wish I had a friend like you to shopping with.❤❤❤
Baeritto fam ❤️
I never really watched your channel, but saw you on Kristi’s vlog and this was in my recommended and I love Taylor, now I’m here and you’re the best 😭
I love your hair... 
You have a perfect heart face and I have a lopsided wig...
I live for your videos 😂
Oh my Lord! I LOVE! Love, love, love the eye look!!!!!
The eye look 😍😍😍😍 like wtf do a tutorial on it 😍👏🏽
Can you ovulate? 😂😂😂😂😂
can you ovulate😂😂😂
Love CYO and I am oily. I use it alone or to combine with the fenty foundation. Wish they had better color range tho
Love Taylor. Watched her for a long time
Yas!!!! Taylor deserves this shout out!!! I have been watching her for a couple years and she totally deserves to be shown in the light!!!!!!!💛
Please do a full face of C.Y.O makeup 💜💙 I wish I could get that brand to Australia!
Omg this is so dope I love Taylor and Manny. This is amazing that you’re supporting each other and the cause♥️
i love the finish of that foundation, i have it, problem is the shade range.
We need a tutorial on that eye look
That moment when you know which shade Taylor wears because you’ve heard her mention it in her foundation swatches sooo many times! 😂💁🏻‍♀️
I love that you're helping another youtuber and donating to her fundraiser!!
Omg so it looks like your not even wearing makeup that's fuckin crazy. And I have dry skin so I think ima hellla love it lol
I love that tarte blush notebook!!!!!!! I wish they would come out with it again!!!!!!!
Insta- alyssarose1225  ♥️
Can you do a full face of C Y O
Awe I love ThaTaylaa!!!❤🖤
Who else loves the new vlogging videos? I'm happy you decided to add them in! Love you Manny!
Can you own it 🤣👏
I use it for oily skin after i found it from ThaTaylaa and after an entire work day it never fades off or comes off my nose. I do use an oil controlling primer on my nose, but everywhere else stays perfect all day long without any primer! It is absolutely amazing!
Aw Manny! What a great video! this fundraiser is so cool I didn’t even know about this organization 👍🏼👍🏼  I wish I could like this video 1000 times!
Your sense of humour is me lol 😆 I’ve been watching your vids since the early days . Loved this . Keep vlogging!
what can makeup do for you? I have adult acne and BAD acne scars and just a red face. I don't wear makeup for anyone but me! To help me feel more confident and no so self contentious... thank you SO MUCH for donating! I'll be doing the same thing this coming weekend (it could help me NOT think about the 17 inches of snow outside that's piling up AGAIN tonight!)
CYO? Can Your Olives. Crave Young Oranges. Carry Your Own
Can you opsess ❤
Can we get a video with that eye look tho?
I love vlog manny❤️❤️
Definitely do a full face!
Marco is so cute haha 😍
You probably won't read but I sent you a DM on Instagram.
The new L’Oréal infallible stick foundation has been my go-to. 🙌🏻❤️
Product beauty share sounds like a wonderful organization. There is so many cosmetics that we open and try but it doesn’t work for our skin type or tones, but we can’t return them since they’re opened that we can give back to others. ❤️
Your eye make up is goals 😭😭😭
I want to slow mo you saying “dope” I love it!!
Lmfao!! Can You Ovulate
anyone know what cyo actually stands for. I have so many product from them but never even thought about it lol
When that foundation cap landed dead on top of your straw I died!!! ☠️😂
Those eyes, baby! I LIVEEEEEE!😍
Maybe CYO stands for “call it your own” or “create your own”?? Honestly living for this foundation
ahh! I’m happy! I love Taylor so much!! The support is unreal, this is what the beauty community needs!!! 👏🏻💕
I am pumped I bought 3 bottles the other day... because between you and Taylor, it’ll never been in stock again. 😂
Please keep vlogging!!! You’re so good at it, so sweet!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
“ I love being sneakyyyy” ily😂
9:41 omg lmao!

Like literally I was watching this and my husband calls me like in the middle of thevideo and I really didn't want to answer the phone 😂😂😂 but yes you should do a video just using c.y.o. products love you!!!!! 😍👏👏😂
My guess is create your own, i've loved taylor since the first 15 days of foundation.
c y o 
create your own
Just wondering what palette you used for your eyes, because the brightness of the pigments was awesome!!!  Also, am I the only one that thought CYO...Can You Orgasm!!!  LOL.  Love watching you, Manny!!!

Great. Now I’m NEVER going to be able to get more of this foundation 😩 but so happy for Taylor and the exposure her and project beauty share are getting from you.
Omg I love her she’s the reason y I try different foundations lol no joke
Great. Now I’m NEVER going to be able to get more of this foundation 😩 but so happy for Taylor and the exposure her and project beauty share are getting from you.

Holy crap that eye shadow

Yr. a SWEETHEART MANNY.
Honestly havent stanned manny in a WHILE but ive been watching Taylor going on 4 years and im SO happy such a big influencer is calling attention to the amazing things she does!
Love how you give drugstore makeup a try was wondering if anyone has used the BH cosmetics foundation? If you have what did you think.
Looooooooove the vlog portion the most!
7:50 and then 9:07 what you were looking for
Awee I love her I have been watcher her for years!!!!!
CYO stands for Create Your Own. And it’s exclusive to Walgreen’s
I’m crying here. I’ve been following Taylor for years and I get so excited for her 15 days of foundation. And then to see you post this. You have won me back over manny. I was sad with what happened in the past but this video, you redeemed yourself with me. Thank you for this selfless act. 🙏🏻

Love this foundation, been using it for like a year now, the undertone is perfect! Not orange or pink but their shade range does suck, i need a lighter shade for sure: I have oily/combination skin and it’s lovely. Im on my 4th bottle 😂
i love you manny! you are so funny i cant
Is it just me or does Manny look chopped when he went to Walgreens?
I wish they had CYO in the Netherlands.... But oh wait it would be like 10euros here lol...
9:49 Create, color, call your own
CYO stands for Call your own, create your own,color your own…it's beauty on your terms.
Can you please try Mally beauty!?
CYO CAN YOU ORGASIM LMAO
we STAN a Baerito
Legend has it manny will reply, like, and love this.
You should do a full face of c.y.o
The eye make up makes me wanna scream😍😍
PLEASE DO A FULL FACE OF CYO!!!
Cant try it. No shades for me.
Manny:  This is honestly the best video I've ever seen of yours because of the content.  It's quite nice and giving of you to do a shoutout and donation to the cause.  On another note, I would love it if you did a full face of CYO makeup.  There's no store within 100 miles of me that sells it, so I would have to order it online.  It would be helpful to have you test it out first to let us know if it's a goodie or a baddie.    xo
Did you use a primer?
You have a big heart for sharing something like this! I met Taylor at a meet and greet and absolutely love her! Would be awesome if you guys did a foundation review together or something :) Pale skins unite haha
That is so nice of you guys to do. And I loved the foundation I actually  want to try it out because ever since about 2 years ago my face went from oily to really dry 😬 and it's really affordable so I'm going to try it out😃💕💕
I’m loving the vlogs in the beginning of the videos 😍😍
Manny😍😍 This video is BOMB!😍
I used to work as a beauty consultant for Walgreens and CYO stands for 
Create Your Own😋
It’s actually WALGREENS BRAND!😋
Thanks for supporting Taylor and Project Beauty Share! Amazing!😍😍😍
“Create your own”??🤔
COLLAB PLZZZZ
you are the funniest off all human
TAYLOOOORRRRRRRRRR❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love love love you & thataylaa!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Maybe C-Y-O could be:        C - Y - O  =  Create Your Own...       Create Your Own beauty, your own dreams, your own life!!!
I LOVED the beginning song!!! ❤️❤️
Yes please do a full face using cyo
This is going to be gooooooood!!!! You are so nice!!! 😊
Tutorial on these eyes PLEASE
Yaaas queen supporting another queen! Love this!
Better answer correctly lol
I don't have that brand at my Walgreens ☹☹☹
The girl in the thumbnail looks like a healthy version of Eugenia Cooney
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHJA CAN YOU OVULATE
I’ve been sitting in my bathtub trying to think of what the o stands for for so long my toes are raisins
Is their a matte? Because at the end of my day. You would be able to fry eggs on my face if I wore it😩
Create, Colour, Call it Your Own - according to their website.
This is actually the only video of yours I've ever seen, why? Why is it?
Love LOVE love this eye look!!!
This foundation is great to mix with other foundations
I bought the CYO Foundation because of Taylor.  I literally wear it every day. Shade 112 for any of my foundation twins!! I have oily skin and love the finish even if its dewy. Idk... something about this foundation works for me
I’m so grateful that you did this!!!!!! I was hoping I would hear influencers talk about this fundraiser! Taylor is wonderful I love watching her! And you as welll! You have a heart of gold Manny! 💗💗💗💗💗
I get so excited when you post videos 😍✌️
Yes do a full face testing. It looks like they have a matte foundation
I honestly love you 🧡🧡
Omg manny! I need to know what eye products you used!!!!!!!! I need I neeeeeeed I need it!!!!!!!!
Can You Oxidase?
When Manny sang "staring straight" and looked to the mirror I was like "girl she ain't no straight" LOL
I love her sooo much!!!🙂😍🤗💕
I’m glad Thataylaa this getting recognized she’s freaking amazing been watching her for years!!! ❤️❤️❤️💕
Wondering what pallete  he used on those eyes tho 🧐
"Manny's for everyone!"
a ton of beauts
9:40 got me DEADDD 😭😭😂😂😂
I love Manny sooo much! I think it is amazing that you wanted to help a fellow influencer bring light to such an amazing cause! I really admire the way you use your platform, you don't get political or try to sway your viewers one way or another even when it comes to make up. The only downfall about this video in my opinion, is that this felt like an ad or sponsored video for C.Y.O. Yes, you were making jokes about the brand's name and what the acronym may stand for, but the way you pushed it even though your face looked like an oil slick. I just hope you are being honest with us (your viewers)
CYO means Create Your Own it’s a Walgreens owned brand
LOVE the neon eyes too!!
They should create a CYO Matte Foundation 🥰
LOVE YOU!!!
OMG your eyes!!
Please do full face cyo!!!
Waiittt why does your local Walgreens look so nice.....
Notification squad WHATS GOOODDD! What camera do you use to film Manny?! 😘
Taylor is so amazing !!!! I watch all of her videos ❤️
Create your own.😂
That giggle in the beginning 😂
ummm picking this up next time im out!!!
I love you for loving Taylor ! New subscriber ❤ hiiiiiiii 👋
lmfaooo the white chicks reference

You and thataylaa are the QUEEENSS of makeup on YouTube! 😍
Why are you so funny 😂😂
Your a natural vlogger Manny❤️❤️❤️❤️
Create,your,own 😂😂
Ok so I was already loving Walgreens vlogging manny, but when that foundation cap fell on your straw..... I died. I couldn’t stop laughing for the longest time.
I'm not that big of a fan of you, but I like a select few of your vids this is ,one if them
Taylor is the best 🖤 Her videos are amazing and she works soooo hard!
Full face of CYO is needed
C.Y.O. Create Your Own..... Color Your Own..... I guess its customizeable!!!!!! Lol
Since everyone’s here x





I just did the Going to the BEST reviewed  in my city!  I’d appreciate anyone who sees this & checks it out💋
I love love love Taylor I got so excited to see this
9:40  😂😂😂oh my god that laugh
That eye look manny hooowwww 🤭😍😍
I’m watching this high and your humor brings me so much joy 😭
Fuck I said I wasn’t gonna watch u anymore but since u included Taylor and this awesome charity I will and I will rethink of subscribing.  Either way thank you for sharing the word of an amazing utuber and this fundraiser.
Eye look tutorial needed
When there’s no Walgreens in Canada lol
That eyeshadow is literally to die for
That is an amazing thing!! Love you manny. I'm currently left a abusive marriage my ex husband destroyed all my makeup I had and I'm currently jobless and homeless. I hop from couch to couch but there are days I dont have a couch to lay on so I sleep where I can. I would love to be in a shelter and there isnt a women's shelter where I live ☹😔. I love you and your videos. You are an amazing person!! Xoxo🥰❣❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Manny SSHhhhhhh girl, we're trying to keep the magic that is CYO a secret to those that don't know!
Cyo- create your own.  ?
btw cyo stands for color your own
I love thataylaa and her message and effort to help those in need! Make up can make people who are down feel more confident bring them out of a dark place! Even if it’s just a little make up and it doesn’t seem important!
I'm hoping you did a video on that eye look😍😍😍
So cute ❤️ I LIVE for you! ❤️😍
During this video I was like yesss I’m gonna go buy this today. Then I realized the second I go to look for this the shelves are going to be CLEARED because Manny posted it. Lmaooo maybe another day
Look at you getting all creative 😋 yes, do a full video of this brand please 😁
that foundation looks BOMB though real talk! best ive seen your skin look EVER manny.. like ever bruh
I love when you vlog! ❤❤❤
I think CYO means create your own right?
I literally would die if I met MannyMUA at walgreens. Ummm I'm going to get this foundation.
Came over from Taylor’s channel!  I haven’t actually watched you before but I loved it. Thanks for the shout out to our girl! And thanks for,helping the baerito’s reach their goals!
I have to say, even though you are oily, the foundation isn’t breaking up or looking cakey. That is what I look for in a foundation. Looks amazing on you.
Am i having deja vu or did I dream you talking about this foundation? lol
Such an amazing cause 💜💜💜
I don’t know about anyone else but i soooo want a tutorial on the eyes . 😍
thataylaa and Manny.... hope you guys have a great success with the fundraiser, is great to know that makeup can be used to help others!!
Thanks to Taylaa this is my new foundation i use everyday i have 7 of them right now in stock so i won't run out Lol. Love this foundation.
Can You Orgy  😂
I absolutely love your eye make up! I would love to try and do something super fun like that. 💜 Love you Manny!!!
CYO “Create Your Own” 😉
Taylor is amazing!! And your eyes 💛
🌯BAERRITO🌯
Is that foundation on your curtains lol 😂
Can you ovulate!!! Lmaooo
C.Y.O: Create Your Own
Watching this and thinking the nars pump that doesn't come with the product  costs more than this foundation.
I love her! Thanks for sharing Manny! I’m going to have to try this foundation ASAP
Try the l.a girl pro matte foundation its 8 bucks, that and the ordinarys full coverage foundation for literally 6 bucks. Its fire how inexpensive but amazing they both are... i reach for them more than my dior or too faced.
Try the new L’Oréal foundation!
I hate that u never post the creative looks 😭😭😭
Marcus gf is probably soooo jelly lol
BIIIIITCH I’ve been trying to get that foundation for months and you get to just walk right in the store and grab it?! 😩😩😩 No fair!
It's probably something like "Create Your Own" look...
She's amazing!
When I saw that Taylor inspired you I was so happy I've been watching both of you for years!!
MANNY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
WHAT SETTING POWDER
I’m an oily t-zone girl. I love love love this foundation. I use a matte primer and Laura mercier powder on my nose and forehead and it lasts me all day.
$@)&9@88& tell me why I was just going to make a trip to buy this ! 😫😫😴
C y o create your own look thats wut i think
What powder did you use? You didn’t tell us!
Manny! I love you!
Clicked on this bc of all the comments I saw on thataylaas video and this is so cool shes a great person and your video was super funny and entertaining  ♡
CYO-create your own lol
Yessss full face c.y.o!
I love your videos😘
The eyes tho!!! 😍😍😍
yes! we love thataylaa!!!!
Please do full face of cyo?
Manny great review
Eye tutorial please
Create your look😂
Maybe try the CYO no shine zone foundation, and let us know how that one works on oily skin.
I love that😍
Isn’t it “create your own”? Hahahha lol i dunno
@Mannymua you should of used this one instead it the matte one in a black tube in the C Y O brand
That foundation made you look like you have perrrrfect skin
I love this foundation but I too am oily. I mix in a little fenty with it to add coverage and oil control and it’s PERFECT! It goes 12 hours with only one blot.
You're so cute!
The bloopers are everything
9:40 that laugh 😂
Manny... ok so I just saw this story on snap and they were reviewing the “Makeup Revolution 196 Pan Color Spectrum Pigment Pallete”. I think you should review it yourself because I love your videos and your honest opinion of products makes a big difference in who buys what.
Create Your Own. CYO...lol love watching you
Thanks for bringing attention to Taylor's project! I love her and what she is doing for Women in need!
Please do a full face tutorial using c.y.o cosmetics I just heard of this brand, that was cool of the worker in walgreens to let you know he watches you now with his gf I can't get my bf to watch no makeup related stuff lol
That makeup look, waooow.
I know this video is a few months old but I just subscribed to your channel not so long ago. Wanted to say THANK YOU!!! For shouting out Taylor and what she does. I feel like she deserves all the love and recognition. Love her and her channel so much. Also, HOW COOL WAS THE STRAIGHT MAN RECOGNIZING YOU AND KNOWING WHO YOU ARE!!! Lol his girlfriend has a keeper. So cool. Lastly, you’ve become one of my latest obsessions!! Love your personality so much!! And you SLAAAYYY!!!
Yeeees Vlog style!
Urrmmm, slaayyyyyy...???? YESSS MANNY YESS
Please do a full face of cyo!!!!!
Hi foodie beauty
What beauty blender does he use?
That foundation looks so tiny in Manny’s hand 😂
4:11 BWAHAHAHAHAH!!!  Over the past few months I have been seriously enjoying the silliness and humor of Manny... oh, and the makeup of course. But really, the silliness...
C.Y.O. Create Your Own?
Lol I know where that is!!!! I use to live around there
Cyo means create ur own
create your own???? hahaha
Can you ovulate?!!!
You should try for a singing career
Taylor first recommended this before she went on Accutane and had oily skin... I also have oily, sometimes combo skin and this is my HG foundation because for me it never breaks down and all you have to do is blot it once or twice a day. I actually feel silly trying out other foundations because this one is so reliable.
Can you ovulate? Idk can you? Lmbo I'm D. E. D
Full face of CYO!!!!
Where are you located?
THATS COOL
Call Your Offsprings! Hahahahaha just kidding :)
Lmfao!!! For real?!?!?😂😂😂 can you.... ?! Omnowanapea
create your own lol
Amazing foundation!
I bet it means Create Your Own
I hate yoooouuuuuu 😭 you make me cackle lmao it’s 2 am and I disturbed the peace 😂 sorry mommy go back to sleep I’m not choking
Yo!!! That eye look!!!!! 😱😲😳
CYO Create Your Own
No se pero ami me encantan tus videos aun k no te entienda mucho.
You should do a 5 below store makeup haul and the a makeup tutorial using the 99 cent store makeup
Please try more of their brand!!!!
CYO ? Complete your outfit?
Ohhh those eyes hunny 😍😍😍😍😍
LOVE MANNY. LOVE TAYLOR. LOVE CYO. BAM BAM AND BAM!!

Please do a full face of C.Y.O. I mean I'm not in the states I don't even know what it stands for but like we be needing those drug store everyday vibes. Can't be using your fenty for the office. Please.
cyo, create your own
What powder did you use?
All these beauty gurus think they can sing lmao
Create your own??
What powder did you used?
Sriracha ❤️
Cyo can you own 😂
Maybe it means " create your own "
MANNY MUA IS BEAUTIFUL BOY AND BEST BLOGER IN WORLD ❤💙💚💛💜💓💕💖💗💘💝
Yes full face cyo
C.Y.O= Call.Your.Own
What powder you using to set the face? Help an oily girl outttttttt 😘
Create Your Own?
Can. You. Ovulate. Hahahhahhaha DEAD🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I laugh so hard at your videos. Just love you 💗 & that eye look, dayummm 😍🔥
My skin is just like yours and i can’t find a drug store  foundation that stays on.
Create Your Own?
C.y.o colour your own create your own call your own
that eyeshadow is to die for!!! wish i had your talent!
Holy Shit those Eyes.... I died
Ur not yellow!!! but this mixture looks like the best tone
Can you out last 😁
A  P U M P
C.Y.O -- Call it Your Own.. Is what is say on the website.. I was curious myself too.
Love you manny !
Im here for manny now cuz taylor is my giiiiirl
Just subscribed because you have such a big heart for supporting Thataylaa's cause.
I now want all the other big beauty YouTubers to support what Taylor is doing by making a video too!!... xXx
Taylor also got me hooked on CYO foundation. It is my absolute favorite. I realized they also make a matte foundation that is more full coverage and I like mixing the two together. You may like the matte one better Manny.
FULL. FACE. CYO. DO. IT.
Long time Taylor followed here. Hard to find people as pale as me. This foundation is eternally sold out in the lightest shade ever since she started using it. Dying to try it.
14:26 😂😂
Ha ha ha it's create your own
Makeup can get someone a job. Not kidding. If you show up at a job interview all glammed up, your confidence gets a boost, and you are more likely to get it...
Thank you for sharing Taylor’s Project Beauty Share campaign!
Full face of CYO please!!! Also loving how down to earth you've been recently! It's so refreshing ❤️
Omg my favorite makeup guru youtuber of all time !! “ Can You Onomatopoeia “😂😂trying to figure out what CYO stands for !!😂😂😂
Loved this!! I just uploaded a WISH activewear lookbook if you want to see! 😱😱
That eye makeup omgggg I LIVE😍💕
Why are you so gorgeous ? ♥️
So amazing for talking about taylor and 15 days of foundation ❤
Off to Walgreens I go 😀
That look you live! I love it so much i love you! I hope i met you that would be everything 😍😘😘😘
“CAN YOU OVULATE” me asf because anytime I’m given the opportunity to guess what something stands for I always go for the most inappropriate option possible 🤷🏽‍♀️😇
Thataylaa is AMAZING! I've been subbed to her for a grip and she is beautiful on the inside and out! When i need a new foundation, I check if shes done a vid! And yes, there have been studies linking makeup to self esteem!!! So I'm glad to see charities dedicated to this specific cause!
All I can say that you are beautiful with or without make up.!! And you also have a good heart ♥️. I’m a big fan of yours. I really like that you are honest with all your reviews. Hands down !! You’re amazing 😉!!!
Hi Manny!
My name is Marco and I am a small town boy from Stockton CA🙂
I hope you have a chance to read this message because it would mean such a blessing world to me. You are so unique and full of such great adventures and full of excitement. How do you do it Manny?How do you make your beautiful dreams come true out of nowhere? How do you keep your beautiful face and self-motivation going? Even though you know how many negative comments there are nowadays by people? The reason I ask all these questions is due to me having the same motivation and amazing dreams that you have but so scared, paranoid, unsure, unconfident, and that i don't know what to do Manny. My dreams are full of helping people to inspire their dreams, make them feel happy and full of energy. That anything is possible if they just put there mind to it. But, how can I do that if I haven't done it myself? If you are reading this Manny it would mean a lot to me if you could reply to me 🙂If not I completely understand. You are such an extraordinary person that I hope I am one day as half as you are 😊. Thank you Manny.
Love Marco Juarez
Maybe it stands for ceate your own?
CYO maybe Create Your Own ? Sounds good
Glossy skin? I’m living. I think CYO stands for Create Your Own?? No idea but ur skin looks so good on camera w that foundation
WHAT EYELINERS ARE YOU WEARING ?! Oh my I’m living !
ahhhh i love you😂
I had followed her for such a long time, but she changed and I didn't like the change so I simply just stopped following her.
Loved this video.
Yea.. I’m gunna need a tutorial on that eye look STAT! 🔥😍🔥😍🔥
My favorite foundation! 💕 perfect for my dry skin
I love Taylor ❤️ Also Manny that shade is spot on! 👌🏻 looks amazing 😉
Definitely will try this.  Love you manny 😻
You’re such a beautiful person!! ❤️❤️❤️ I love your videos, your vlogging, hear you singing!! 😂😂😂😂 and ofc YOU!
But what did the vendor on the street say?! I need to know!! 😩
We love Taylor! This is awesome Manny
Your laugh had me dying when you said it’s dewy 😂😂😂😂❤️
We need a full face of this brand , I’ve never even heard of it either. But that foundation looked beautiful..❤️❤️ Plus I will be donating.. anything for a great cause!! ☺️
Omg Manny trying to figure out what cyo stands for is the best thing ever I'm literally crying
omg Manny your so awesome I watch your videos every night. you inspire to want to try make up I've never tried it before but maybe one day I will.
Ok but that eyeshadow 😍😍😍😍
I don't usually have self esteem issues, but we all have bad days &  I do suffer from pcos though & that means hormonal acne, migraines, & hormone related depression & anxiety sometimes. On the days those get me down, putting on my makeup can go a long way to boosting my mood. I have fun putting it on, creating diff looks & generally just making myself feel better. If I couldn't afford cosmetics: skincare or makeup, it would def affect my life. How much better does it make u feel to be able to conceal a large red pimple & pretend it's not there, or cover a dark mark, or hide those dark circles & pretend u got 10 hrs of sleep when u only got 4? It does wonders 4 me. I want everyone to have the oppertunity 2 do those things if they want to & cost should not be the things that prohibits
Yay u watch thatylaa
They have a matte foundation too.
I love you Manny
Never haggard
Ima but this so muchhhh
So I have a question. I see that your oil is showing through but did you oil break apart the foundation? That my problem I don’t mind looking oily but it always dissolves my foundation.
I love mixing my foundation. I mix shades and different formulas, I love mixing in BB cream with salicylic acid that is for acne prone skin, since I get oily it helps keep the foundation matte for longer. Def not on dry days but it is awesome, I was mixing luminous primers with my foundations too and it is nice also but it sheers it out a little bit.
Lmao the abbreviations, Create your own? 🤷🏻‍♀️😂😂
I am screaming at the transformation wow so colorful I love it manny ! 🥰💕
Your eye makeup is everything 😍😍
Hey manny- did you prime before using this?? I wanna know if it worked well with or without
Can’t wait for the video on that eye look tho❤️❤️  also can you do a full face of indoor/outdoor swapmeet makeup?
omg two of my favorites, that’s great. taylor needs more subscribers bc she’s awesome. 💛
manny!! c.y.o. create your own
Can you ovulate !!!! lmao 😂
I know where that Walgreens is!!!!😭
Yes!! Baerittos in the house!!!!!
I’ve been watching her for years she’s awesome
I’m pretty sure the CYO stands for create your own lol
I know you are getting a lot of hate recently manny. But I see your heart and I know you are a good person and I want to encourage you to keep growing as a person and Mua. I’m sending lots of love to you from Alabama. ❤️
Love the vlogging love that you shouted out Taylor! She is the go to foundation guru!
Watch this video get more views than he's had in MONTHS
Is it create your own ??
Was just watching her lastnight she’s amazing! BUT 
LOVE ME ANY MANNY VIDEO EVER

Thank you for using your platform for good. I'm addicted to makeup...so last Christmas I mailed 10 different women across the country.... I have a makeup page on FB.... and these women always put othes5 of themselves,  and they didn't have money to buy makeup. It felt so incredibly amazing to be able to give back 💓💓
CYO 
Can you ovulate? 😂
Create your own? 🤔
Literally just came from watching Taylor's ulta serum foundation review lmao
Manny you are amazing this is my very first comment on YouTube and I watch your videos all the time 😘😘😘

You are my favourite human!❤️love from canada

No make up brand probably stands for one of these: colour your own, conceal your own, create your own, or call your own
Those fillers tho 😭😭😭😭
i’ve never seen a foundation look better on you
YAAASSS VLOGG MOREEE
Does it mean Create Your Own??? Lol
I bought that foundation because of her a long time ago and it’s one of my most used foundations now! I’ve gone through about 6 bottles :)
