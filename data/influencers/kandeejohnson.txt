Kandee,
You’re one of my favorite YouTubers because of your sweet spirit! I think a New Year's Eve video into 2019 would be great!

I looked back at some of your old videos and I can relate to to so many of your scenarios. Because of that I will say to you: Stay true to Yourself (You’re Amazing just the way God made you); Keep pressing for the high mark of the one that matters (He sees you and your effort); And....Always remember (when the world forgets) you are unique, special and one of a kind. You have a purpose that no one else can accomplish and you have all you need to accomplish it. Love and Blessing to you for 2019 :)
  :)
I miss your videos girl💖💝
Those vitamine c packets is definitely something my husband needs! He hates getting and if he does he wants to get better instant! (I mean everyone does but he’s to the extreme) 🤣
Tutorial from your Mexico Vlog vid--your face was stunning--as always!

Kandee is like wine . She gets better by time i mean seriously damn woman you re gorgeous ❤️❤️
That charcoal dry shampoo sounds neat. As a mom I’m lucky to have time for a body shower let alone washing my hair. Dry shampoo is life
The worst year of my life was 2018. My 25 year old son died from an overdose on my bathroom floor. His gf and I found him. I have been beyond depressed so I look for things to cheer me up. Like your videos and shopping and this time I did both. I got 3 of your favs and I love them! - the Clinique liquid eyeliner, the unicorn kisses lipbalm and your amazing creamsicle trio! I love how bubbly and beautiful you are, on the inside and out! I even have my girls following you! I just wanted to thank you for being you, please don't ever change!  I live in Canada but I would most definitely hug you if I ever met you. It would be an honour <3 xoxox
I absolutely just adore you! Been following you since the beginning of your YouTube days. 💕💅🏽
Love, love, LOVE you Kandee! You are such a beautiful, loving, kind, intelligent, helpful & inspirational soul...thank you for being you! As for videos I’d like to see, absolutely anything you WANT to do because as long as you enjoy it we will too! My heart & prayers are always with you as I know you keep on smiling through your tears...hugs to you my kindred spirit 🙏🏼❣️🤗
You always make my days luv.. With your positive words and absolutely gorgeous heart. We are survivors in this sometimes crazy world. As long as we focus on the good things life will be alright. Love you Kandee 🤗😘

There are so many things you said that I want to quote because you crack me up, girl! 🤣 This video was great and I was totally thinking a quarterly/seasonal favorites would be the thing to do! I love those marble nails! And great job on the collab design! Even the things that have been your favorites for years and years, either it's great to know you still love them, or I feel good realizing how long I've been watching you and knowing your go-to products 😊 You are so special and so talented, I love watching anything that is you being you, because it's just so much more refreshing than the trends!! Thank you for your constant positivity, even when you're dealing with so much sometimes. Love you lots!!! Here's to the happiest of new years, new successes, and new friendships! ❤❤😙🥂
Merry Christmas Kandee! I love this style of filming - it just makes you seem more connected to your audience. I think seasonal favorites are better because by then you've got a solid opinion on the product. As for future videos it would be great to see a day in the life of the magnificent Kandee 😁 or start a look book type thing - outfits and makeup for different occasions. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ whatever you do will be great!
Seasonal favs would be so good! And more tutorials!!!!!!!
You’re the best! Thank you for the years —you were THE first YouTuber I ever watched/subscribed and to this day, the very best. 💕So happy and full of love—love your positivity.
My first video of yours I ever watched was the lemon scrub! I love ALL your videos... I love your what’s in my purse videos too and I don’t think anyone does those anymore 😂 Merry Christmas and have a blessed New Year!!
You Look So positive and beautiful .I have been with you from the last 4 years and I just love how genuine you are .Have a great year and never loose your kindness.Love u ♥️♥️

kandee i cried at the end of this with your bit on a good new year coming up. my grandpa passed away on the 10th of this month, we just had his service on the 19th and we place his ashes to rest on the 26th. so granted you're a stranger ive only watched online for years it totally made me feel better hear that reminder of patience it works out, it takes time. 2018 i found put my bf (now ex)  of 9 years cheated on me for half a year with someone almost 10 yrs younger than me when 2018 started and now as its ending, my grandpa passed. oy, such a hard year but it will all work out. a good year is coming, just have to remember patience. thanks kandee for that reminder.
Just order ur body cream and scrub line!!!!! Xoxo Happy Holidays
I LOVE and have always loved favorites videos 🦄🔮💎✨😻
I LOVED how natural and real this felt. YouTube needs so much more of this.
7:48 I have tons of sympathy 4 U, Kandee.  😭😭😭😭😭😭  I hate 2 C U sad.  💔💔💔💔💔💔
I love your favorites videos! But then again I LOVE all of your content! My favorite youtuber by far! You are so genuine and such a truly kind and beautiful woman inside and out! I look up to you so much and I am so proud of you and how insanely far you've come! Your daddy is in heaven living it up with Jesus and so incredibly proud of his little girl! One day you will meet again and we will all spend eternity in heaven together with our Savior! Jesus is the reason for the season!! Love you so much Kandee! I hope you have the best Christmas ever and enjoy some wonderful time with your sweet family! Xoxo❤🎄🎁😍 P.S. YOU are my favorite!!! Xoxo
I love your favorites! Please keep doing them!!!
Your hair and makeup looks amazing in the picture for this video, can you do a video for the hair and makeup look.
Omg Kandee! You are such an amazing person - thanks for the video and the great holiday messages on your IG Stories - they definitely made my holidays a little brighter - ILYSM 💞

Yes, please, more favorites!  Anything you do is great, though.  Just like to see your face!
I miss these videos from you ❤️❤️❤️ perfect Xmas eve present!
I do not understand the point of the dislike button on YouTube. Why can't we just have the Like button and then be able to see the names of the people who liked the video, so we can understand their demographics. Then we can go to their page and see a summary of where they post on YouTube, their comments, and see if they are hateful or positive. I cannot understand why anyone would not like Kandee's videos! They are amazing!
You upload like once a month....
Yessss bring back the favorites !!!!!
Hope you and your family have an amazing Christmas. Great video as always Love you kandee

I miss your vlogs! Wishing you a wonderful 2019, Kandee 😀

You’re amazing, Kandee! Happy New Year!!! Thank you for always being an uplifting positive role model! You could do a video on how to eat soup and I’d watch it😂😂😂! Love and hugs!💕💗💕💗
I love Kandee soo much! She is so pure and sweet and fun.
I hate how she thinks if she doesnt have highlighter she thinks she wont 'look cute' or that she needs a lip plumper to have fuller lips. You should love yourself the way you are!
Any videos you do are loved. Maybe talk about your kids. Hard things you’ve overcome. How you stay positive. Rules for life. Staying true. 
Merry Christmas Kandee!
Seasonal favourites for sure in 2019. & maybe an odd one but I want to see grocery hauls hahah, I live in Canada so I love seeing what people in other countries buy

Quarterly faves or really do love your monthly faves.  Love you Kandee.  God bless and happy new year
You keep looking younger and  younger..can u plz do an updated video of your skin care routine. I mean u do not even have wrinkles under your eye.
Merry Christmas! This is so helpful - getting ready to do a big trip and this helps! Stay awesome!
Yes to the favorites please! Im going to cosmetology school, and we focus way more on hair than makeup. So self teaching and research from my beauty mentors like you will have to be my bread and butter for the makeup world!
Monthly favorites would be so awesome!! Great video, so helpful. Also, if you could do a makeup tutorial on how you had it when you did your last life update video and told why u weren’t on YouTube for a while. You are always beyond beautiful, but I’d really like to see exactly what makeup you used to do that video because it was absolutely perfect! Happy new year!!🎆
hey! who said fav vids are unpop?!? It's only boring when EVERYone has the SAME favs...your favs aren't typical/boring! #thankyounext fav vid
Home Decor and vlogs! I love your makeup but I love you as a person and would be so interested in seeing other things in your life.
Hi Kandee, I'd love to see videos where you show highlights of old videos that you've maybe changed your mind about, or altered your routine with.
Hi Kandee love this. Please could you do your favourite foundation, eyeshadow, blush etc.... possibly high end and low end. Xxxxx
I just love these videos and all videos you do, I don't mind the unedited "unpopular" videos, they're great in my opinion. Thanks for sharing your vibrant, warm and authentic self with us 🦔
Kandeeeeeee!!! I’ve been following you for ten years! When I wanted to be an mua, I did your tutorials on friends to practice! (I went on to train and become a proper MUA!).

Over everything you do - your comedy is the one thing that brings me back time after time (with the infamous 4th July vid being my all time fave).

Never stop being you.....and please recreate some old tutorials! (Including the singing!).

Love C
This is the perfect time to come across your favorites video because I am trying to figure out what to splurge on with my Sephora gift card 😛

Hi Kandee!! 💕
I love that this video is unedited! And I miss your favorite videos! I gotta try that enzyme face wash 😍😍😍
I got my daughter the Claire nails for a Christmas this year! Such a good deal and great quality. She will be thrilled to learn you use them too. Merry Christmas! 🎄
Love u Kandy
Love you, Kandee! Thanks for this!
(YES to New Year’s video!!!)
“Oh great! Now I’m not gonna look very cute!!” Thought that was hilarious, you’re the sweetest, Kandee
Love you, Kandee! Your videos are the best, especially your how-to videos. I think some of the backlash against "Favorites" comes from every month some (not all) influencers having a new favorite X product that basically is whatever they've either been sent in PR or paid by a sponsor. I've never felt that way with yours, but a few others raise an eyebrow. Sending you much love over the holidays!
I've been watching you since you've started and have seen all the amazing things you have done with your career. You are such an inspiration! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your family!
MAKE VIDEOS 😆 just anything! I miss you and you are the QUEEN of YouTube and set the foundation of the YouTube beauty industry. It’s changed so much, and to have you back would be a great blessing! Happy Holidays, beautiful!!
HAPPY CHRISTMAS EVE Kandee!
Yes do more of these and how to's Etc. Miss you much.
I've been watching approximately 4-5 yrs ish.
I'm buying your kit right now!
Sending positive vibes your way.
PEACE LOVE DREAMS!
Merry Christmas Beautiful Kandee & Family!
Happy New Year 2019!
Most Sincerely Crystal Elk.🇨🇦

Merry Christmas to you and your family! I always loved your food recipe videos so maybe some of your favorite things you like to cook or bake for next year’s videos.
I love your Purlisse collab! I gave them to my 2 besties for Christmas along with a few face masks and a candle. I basically made at home spa kits for their gifts.
Kandee, do one onHooded Eyes.  As I age, the skin under my eyebrows is hooding, and eyeshadow is impossible, but I love a smokey eye.  Please? 🤗❤️🤗
Missed your videos Kandee 😍 with this year ending I just wanted to thank you for being yourself, for inspiring me and for helping me go through the hardest times. Thank you for being ALIVE. I LOVE YOU ENDLESSLY ❤️❤️. And I hope that this new year will be much better for you and will bring you joy, happiness and peace 😘😘💖💞
I know i wont see you where i live so I'm sending hugs to you from St. Louis Missouri, i hope you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Happy 10 Yrs. Anniversary!  I Love You.  I remember watching you in the very beginning when you had dark hair and you dyed it in your bathroom!  You would always wear it in a ponytail back then.  Congratulations on all of your success.  It's been so fun and inspiring to watch you through all of these years.
Great video!! Love your sweatshirt!! I wear Claire’s nails and I love them!! I also love those brushes!! Keep pushing on honey 🍯 Happy New Year 🎆
Tips and trick videos for common problems.
I would love to see a video on your skincare routine!  Sending so much love!  You are amazing! Sending you so many hugs... you don’t even know how much you’ve changed my life.  Thank you you!!
You’re AMAZING! God’s vessel for sure!! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!
I always love your videos and hearing from you why you love certain products- it’s neat to hear about all these cool products! I like the idea of seasonal favorites, especially since weather, trends, and other factors can affect what you like and don’t like throughout the year, so if you feel like you could do that, I’d love to see that! 😀 Any video you do, though, I will always enjoy because of your sweet spirit and personality. 😊 Side note, if you’re worried about not editing this video, don’t worry about it! It was a fun change of pace- it made it feel like I was actually sitting there in the room with you, and I liked that! Thanks for sharing this video with us, Kandee- I love you!!! ❤️❤️❤️
We would love to see what ever you come up with. I just want to see more of your videos.
Kandee you are amazing and so uplifting definitely a breath of fresh air was having a crappy Christmas and you made it better. Would definitely hug you on the street. Sending you lots of love and blessings your way. Loved the video!
Kandee! Loving the THRASHER hoodie! I saw Blake's Santa Cruz t-shirt! My hometown! Both companies are owned by NHSinc. If NHS did a Kandee shirt they would sell like crazy. Hoodie would be even BETTER!!💝🎅💝🎅💝
Btw I have Two #Strobeberry 🍓 blushes! Soooo beautiful!!.. Can't wait for your 10yr anniversary YEAR!!
Yes please do! Love favorite videos and empties video! Thank you Kandee you're so awesome.
Kandee, I remember watching my first video of yours of how to cut your own hair at home and you was wearing the green top. I miss your inspo videos and makeup tutorials. Hoping to see more of you in my subscription box in the upcoming 2019.
I still need to try this treat lip balm that you’ve been raving about for years
My favorite video is when you're about to have one of your babies, you are so sweet and it made us all feel like we were right there with you 💛
The Vitamin C packets are a staple in my home. Everyone has a box by their sink! My hubby is a Dr and I have a Masters in Public health-these are the best absorbing Vit C-sold!!!! Very impressed you use these! Hats off and Happy New Year!!!!  Congratulations on 10 years!!!
You never age! So cute :)
You occasionally make a video. You aren’t a YouTuber anymore.

I looooooooove favorite videos!!!!!
I just want to see more videos from you.  Vlogs would be great.
A house tour 💕❤️❤️❤️🎄
I thought it was a get ready with me :(
I love you Kandee! Thank you for bringing us videos like this. The videos that show that people are human, we take long pauses, and we fumble our words. I struggle so much with filming because I feel like I should be perfect, but this video has helped me see a different light. Thank you for this video. Thank you for inspiring people like me! We love you Kandee!!
LOVE you Kandee!
why was this such a rushed video?): we miss you
Please come out with a TShirt with your slogan I will totally buy one... or ten :)
I love your favorite videos!!!!
vitamin c helping a cold is a myth
Love it so much!
I do glue on toooooooooooo😭😭😭😭😭
The Impress press on nails are also AMAZING and last so long! They don’t require glue and are 6-7 dollars
Favorite videos are my absolute favourite, but a Kandee one is overload! Monthly, daily...hourly!!!
💥My favorite, 4th of July video 💥
Yes I miss your favorite videos and your must haves.
Please more favourite videos
I like the video
Would love some new GRWM!!
Love this favorites video! I would love for you to revisit some of your old makeup tutorials and revamp them with todays makeup that is available!
Love your videos! Do one on how you do your everyday face makeup. Like how do you make your skin so pretty without it being cakey or fake looking
You do you. Be true to yourself and not a cookie cutter youtuber.
I miss the Christmas house tours!
Love you!
Don’t EVER stop making videos! Love your organic feel you give to all your videos! I do not trust the internet reviews! I trust you kandee! 🥰 HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
Awesome faves! Oh and what teeth whitener do you use?
You make that shower gel, body lotion etc bundle sound so good im going to order now if available. Always nice when we see a video from you. I swear you are more beautiful every year if thats possible.
I love your videos Kandee your such a beautiful sweet soul wishing you and your family a very merry Christmas xo ❤️🎄🎅💚🎁❄️
I’ve missed you and your videos SOOOOOO much!!!!
Most beauty you tubers have had ‘alot of work’ as fillers etc. some of  them look pretty strange. I don’t know if you have but you look perfect! You should give them lessons.
Wow has it been that long I remember when I found you I was looking for a way to cover dark circles and yours the the first to pop up it was brand new I had to go look and that video is 9 years old it was published May 31 2009. I have been watching your video's a really long time.
I always loved your Christmas videos, where you have shown your Christmas interior, cookies, which you were baking for kids, and so on.
I remember one of the first video I first  watched was the bandana one you did in a restroom. I forgot the name of it.
Can you update the link for the wipes- it keeps taking me to the dry shampoo link. Love this video thanks Kandee!
You’re so awesome!!! Also, in your description you wrote ‘here’s my last video of 2019!!!’ Just in case you didn’t know. Love you ♥️
I LOVE FAVORITES VIDEOS!!!!! These are my absolute favorite and I wish the beauty community did it more often!! I use these videos to see out of alllllllll the makeup they try on, what do they ACTUALLY use over and over and really enjoy. I buy products from favorites videos more than any other video
I dont know why favorites arent popular anymore, theyre some of my favorite to watch! :D
Thank you so much for this video!!! Such a great X-mas treat. I adore favorites videos, especially yours. I would love a monthly favorites videos and have purchased and loved so many of your favorites. Slso would love more real time GRWM videos. Also a new smoothie and baking video.  

Merry Christmas and happy New Year!!!! ❤️💕❤️
Love your recommendations, Kandee! You were the first person I watched on Youtube, and you inspired me to start my channel! We also live in the same town, which is just crazy! So Cool! Thanks for always being real and being a positive person to watch! xoxo
I love the quarterly sounds good, I love the products you use. I have totally taken your advice on some products and purchased them especially your line of shampoo from ogx. Have a merry Christmas 🎁🎄🎅🏽🤶🏼🎄☃️🙋🏻
PLEASE start back doing favorites vids every month....or even every other month!!,I have missed your favorite videos SO much!!!
I didn’t know that favorite videos were of the past. I love watching favorites videos
Happy Christmas Eve Miss Kandee! Thank you so much for sharing all these goodies with us! Sending you hugs and love and I wish you and your beautiful family a wonderful Christmas! <3 <3 <3
Loved this video!! What’s your favorite brands of extension for your hair??
I would love more instructional videos to learn more how tos and understand makeup artistry more!
Thank you so much for the video. I’ve been wanting the “treat” chapstick but could never remember the name lol. I love that your favorites are similar from before but still have some new things in there. It just shows that genuinely love the product and aren’t showing it just for pr purposes. I hope you had a very Merry Christmas and will have an amazingly awesome blessed New Year. I’m hugging you back thru the screen.
I don’t watch favorites, but yours are always really unique, useful things. I’d watch routinely. Merry Christmas!🎄
Monthly favorites please!!!!
Kandee please do skincare routine. I want to know mostly about  antiwrinkle and dry skin issues. Plus I know u r not pregnant at the moment but can u do please do skincare during pregnancy.
this was so much fun to watch!
favorites videos forever!!
Yes more!
All love.💛✨🌻
i like all the original videos.  youtube has started to suck :*  miss all your videos.
Monthly favorites are my favorite
Your favorite videos are my favorite because you put both store brand and high end brands in it.  Also, love your makeover videos and the ones you do on normal everyday people.  You should do a contest for someone to win a makeover from you.  Oh my goodness it would be a dream come true to get a makeover from you.
Missed your favs ...... monthly please.
Another great video. Merry Christmas 🎁 and Happy New Year! Sending hugs, love, prayers and  kindness. ♥️🎄♥️
Yes, hope for the New Year! My Mammaw passed away on December 20th this year and I am having a hard time. I would like to see a home tour. I love when you show your holiday home tours! Love you Kandee and have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! ❤️
Luv u Kandee
I loved this video! I would love to see your fave moisturizer and anti-age cream video. I don’t think I am alone in this wish. Have a blessed Christmas Kandee!
I love that you wear press on nails, im finding they are so super convenient these days! Also dont think you are as much as a germ-aphobe, as much as you are a Makeup Artist, most are very much more aware of Germs.
I 💖 kandee
Kandee I love you! This video was great & makes me feel like going shopping! I have always loved your favourite videos so keep em coming. What I’d love is a New Year hope video, I think it will inspire a lot of people. Merry Christmas to you & all your subscribers.🎄❣️🎅🏼🎄
Where did the lip thing come from
where can i get the hoodie you are wearing???
I love these types of videos so much, Kandee! It’s sad that other Youtubers stopped making these videos. I would love to see personal care videos like how you take care of your nails, feet, face, etc.
I'm so happy you posted a video! I would love to see how you styled your hair for the photo on this one. Also, I would love to see your mom get her face done by you, again. Anything you post is always a hit with me! Happy New Year!
I miss old school YouTube... This was so much fun!
Merry Christmas Kandee! 💋
Lovee you x
I have those same exact nails
The blonde hair is s your BEST look of any years!!! Yes!
Makeup tutorial on this please!!!!!!!
Kandee Merry Christmas
I love u!!!! U replied to my comment one time and it made my year! I love makeup and u r soooooo talented at it
Literally everyone I watch in youtube does favorites videos almost every month. Lol Kandee needs to watch other beauty guru's.
You are so cute !!! Oh great I’m not going to look very cute !!!💕🌹💕
Kandee !!! You are the first youtube I ve ever watched since you started !! I loved your skincare tips videos !
Hey girl, there is no doubt you are a beautiful women, inside and out but I wish you'd have a bit more transparency when talking about skincare or powder that makes your under eyes looks so smooth. You're 40 years old and that's amazing but no powder or eye cream keeps skin looking as good as yours without some extra help. I guess you couldn't be totally honest about Botox and/or  filler either cause people would unjustly drag you for that too but don't hype skin care too hard when you know you've had a little help along the way.
Love you Kandee!!!!!!!! 😻😻😻
I love these videos
Love this video! Love you Kandee! 
In 2019 to celebrate your 10 years on Youtube can you please do a modern day Barbie Makeup Tutorial you have the perfect face & hair for it!
I love you so much Kandee! You’re such a loving and wonderful person!
Are your links to products affiliate links? You didn’t say but I know most of the time youtubers use affiliate links when they have their favorites linked.
💛
Merry Christmas Kandee! Love your favorites videos. I just ordered the Kandee-Luscious Dreamsicle Body Collection as a gift for my amazing beauty stylist ❤ Mara Morrow ❤ (Phoenix) who introduced me to you 7+ years ago. She's going to flip out and we are going to have a total Kandee fan girl moment when she opens it!!  Have a blessed 2019!
We miss you so much on YouTube!  😖  😁
Oh my goodness! I missed you! Could you do more Avengers looks? And some marvels agents of Shield? And maybe some demonstrations of how they used to do all the B-movie sci-fi make up. You know, the kind of stuff that it’s so bad it’s good! I try to pray for you and your family whenever I can. I lost my dad over two years ago too. This Christmas has been really tough missing him and my cat that we put down seven years ago. And on top of that I have viral tonsillitis right now! How unfair is that! I hope I get to meet you someday, it wouldn’t be that difficult seeing as I live in San Diego, but my goodness the traffic! I hope it’s not weird to say, but love you Kandee. 🎁🎉🎄☃️🤗😘🤪🤓🧐😜🤣🧜🏻‍♀️
I miss your videos!!
$20 is such a deal!! When are we going to hang out?? Happy New Year!! 🎆 2019!! 💕💕💕
i love you forever Kandee!!!!!!
MERRY CHRISTMAS KANDEE !!!
Happy New Year Kandee!
I feel like she's affiliated with two faced.  Don't trust her! Stinks. Cuz I liked her.
💕😍💕
Love these videos!
Can we please have a makeup tutorial of the makeup in the thumbnail ???? Bc that’s how I’m trying to look all summer19 😍😩
What happened to you living the liptiful? You had said it was the best one. Is it no longer that good? I bought one. But the results only last like an 1 hour and it takes that long to do my makeup. If I use it after I did my fave it would mess up my makeup around my mouth
can u do a hair video like what shade of blonde u have and how u maintain the health of ur hair?
8:40. . . is patrick starr a boy?  trans or a man in drag. .. real ?   I don't know?
I want baking and lifestyle videos also maybe diet and exercise video because I want a bod like u
Hey KANDEE  I like the YouTube makeup video love you KANDEE YOUR FAN ANGELA FROM GA
I really enjoyed the videos where it was like a news report for your monthly favorites :)
Meryy Merry Merry Christmas Kandee!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️🎄🙏🏻😘😘 You made my Christmas Eve even more special!!! Lots of LOVE and God’s greatest blessings to you!!!!!!! 😘😘🤗🤗🤗⭐️❤️⭐️❤️
i like the unedited version. Everything on youtube seems so produced. It's nice to take it back to the beginning when people feel like real people who don't spend hours editing. Do more of these onessss lol <3 This is cool cause I've been wanting a new face wash and I came straight to you to see what my Kandee girl is using now days and luckily this was the last video you'd done :) Got what i needed
What lipsticks and lipliner are you wearing, love the colors. Love this video!!!
I miss you so much Kandee I would love to see more beauty brand reviews for what you use on your skin like a daytime and nighttime skincare routines. I hope you had a wonderful Christmas
Why did you put your name on a product that you don’t know the price of ???
Grace still does it  which i love
SHE LOOKED SO GOOD AS PRINCESS PEACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can I look like you please??
Thank you for the video 💕💕💕💕

Merry Christmas beauty 🎄🎅🏽🤶🏼❄️☃️🎁🎉✨❤️💚🙌🏼

💜❤️🧡💛💚💙💖
This is soooooo a sponsored video, lol she slick
❤❤❤❤
Kandee! I just wanted to stop on here and say that I LOVE YOU and I have been with you for all those 10 years you’ve been on YouTube. I found you first from your SUPER OLD video on how to wash your brushes. I’ve been with you when you were cutting up T-shirt’s, scrubbing your face with lemons and sugar, when you sliced your leg open, when your dad passed so suddenly, when you home-birthed your daughter, when you moved to Cali. You are the reason I got into makeup which ultimately led me to choose a career in cosmetology. I want to thank you for your creative passion, your sweet nature, your good vibes, and just everything you do. You will always be my favorite beauty guru, and you are so much more than that. I hope you had a wonderful Christmas and have a truly happy new year. I wish nothing but the best for you in 2019 and forever after. 💕
I look forward to favorites, keep them coming. My daughter and I love your character (princesses, movie characters, celebrities, etc.) makeup videos! Hope you have a Happy New Year, love ya girl!
I love you Kandee! You’re a huge inspiration and beautiful human being inside and out !
what lipstick do you have on
I'd love it if you would follow someone else's tutorial. Maybe try swapping clothes with someone for a day?  Maybe you could go to a stylist to try something different?  Also I'd really like to see a video on behind the scenes of you doing make up on clients...  It would be great to see you do something different on this channel.
My favorite long cable for my ipad is juicebitz angled cable. The angle is what it’s about. It doesn’t stress the port as much.
Kandee! Merry Christmas! You wrote me a very kind response once when I was going through a really tough time. I will always appreciate that.
I wish and hope to one day inspire millions with my  channel like you do. I've worked so hard the past 6 years and push harder each day. You probably wont see or read this but I'm putting myself out there because the odd chance you might see an read this means the world to me♡
😙💖💖💖
change the bio hahah, i hope it's not your last video of 2019 hahha
Yay for some Kandee on Christmas! My day has been terrible. I'm reallyreallyreally sick. But seeing your face and faves makes me feel a little better dear <3 Have a happy holiday! and a new years hopes video sounds awesome, like a good way to start things up and toss it into the universe to make stuff happen!
I get my nails at clairs too! Use the kiss glue its a white bottle with the green and white label you’ll thank me!
💖💖💖
La Mer is $375 😲😲😲
I still love your favorites videos, I don’t care that they aren’t hip anymore. I love seeing your health food faves and recipes like the old days Kandee.
Do you not make videos anymore?
Awesome ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have a deep scar from a dog attack on my face.  What do you suggest I can do for ultimate coverage?
Why don't we see your kids anymore?
I wish Kandee would just admit already she’s gotten Lip injections and botox
❤️❤️❤️
Kandee! Yay 😀
You know what I love about Kandee? She keeps the same favorites for years and years which shows how much she sticks to what she loves and you know it's good! Not just shoving random products in our faces. Love it!
Hi lovely. I've found you in 2013 after my mom died and I was looking for a little help. You were talking about your loving dad who passed away and I'll never forget the sunset you were looking at while sitting on the balcony. It was very calming for me as my mom loved sunset and ,as my heart is still broken, this view somehow calmed me down and I believed (I'm not a religious person) that my mom sees this every day now. Maybe stupid but I needed anything to make a little sense of my situation even though I will never be ok with my mom been not with us. You're an amazing person and you deserve all the best. Love you lots xx
Hey Kandee, can you advise what’s on your lips in this video? The colour is beautiful xx
Kandee, please do Trisha's makeup <3
What, wasn’t there a video saying you are no longer doing YouTube. And this video came on my recommendation... you back?
Um yes your faves are always the best! I'd love to hear more health things you like. If you still take the fish oil. And teeth whitening!
Yassss
I love Kandee *.*😘😍😘
hoped to be the last video EVER!
Nobody likes favourites any more because it's full of PR products and Vloggers/Bloggers don't realise that customers have to buy the product....
Reminds me of a 80s song.I      Candy.Hee-Hee!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Suggestions:  Yearly Kandee Calendar for yourself and your fans.  I would have liked to buy some of these favorite products for my daughter for Christmas but the Favorites video came out a little too late.  Can end of year favorites be done in early December next time? Also, what about publishing a calendar online for noting public events & locations, or other monthly/weekly things like a day to clean makeup brushes.  Agree, seasonal/quarterly Favorites is good.  What about adding some craft projects or other non-makeup things - like Martha Stewart for the 2000's except no scary attitude or arrogant pretension?  The calendar was something I liked about Martha's original "Living" magazine was that it helped me to remember what to prepare for seasonally at home.  What about even homeopathic ideas for health & well-being?  Or quick ideas for fast clean-up/home maintenance or products you like that make the job easier?   Museum tours?  There is obviously much more to KJ than just make-up.    By the way,  I strongly recommend trying Nomad Oyyl.  I'm in my 50's and I swear this stuff eliminated fine laugh and other facial lines on me with my extremely dry skin, and the best bit is it's all organic oils natural ingredients and smells wonderful.   Congratulations on your 10 year YT anniversary!
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Kandee, my daughter and I were so excited to buy the palette but we were so disappointed when we missed out on the lippie! Sweet and sour is my dream lippie! And I’m wearing your palette right now lol! 💕
😍💝🥰💕🎁
Missing that MOSCHINO phone case. :D
what the heck you guys we need to get her 4 millions subscribers
I’ve been following you since 2010, you don’t look a day old so my question is what have you gotten done since then I remember you saying you would not do your lips but they do look fuller, if you did get them Done how did you decide? My lips sorta look like your lips use to look, and sometimes I say I’d like to get them done, but it scares me. It would be cool if you could share that, and what was the deciding factor. I know you are out there more like in the spot  light is it demanding on you? Like your appearance ? As in to look youthful? Getting things done on your face? Almost all famous people get non invasive  stuff done. Can’t wait to hear from you.! Have a blessed day ☺️
Where did your forehead wrinkles go? In your earlier videos u can see them but their gone now and your forehead barely moves. Do you botox? No biggy if ya do.  I’ve been thinking about doing it and would love to know if it’s worth it.  Cuz we all know they don’t go away with creams and potions😏
Hey Lady what is on your lips? It’s fantastic!
Kandee I’ve been following you since your very first video! I would read your blog every since day. There wasn’t a day you wouldn’t post! It’s amazing how far you’ve made it. I wish you would still be active in YouTube tho YouTube without Kandee is no longer the same. I feel like now it’s only 1 video a month and soon you’ll resign completely or will make a video every season. Please don’t forget about your subscribers.
Since you’re trying to not get sick, look into Monolaurin. The tough thing is figuring out dosage, and it’s hard on the stomach.
💋
💖❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
    Y💋💋💋💋U!!!!
😁
6:13 « oh great! Now i’m not gonna look very cute » hahaha kandee I laughed xxxx
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Hi
Always continue to be inspired by your videos. My kids follow you too.  I still have your bullying video on my site for my own YouTube haters to watch.  I don't edit any of my videos.  If people don't like me for what I am they can go elsewhere.  Merry Christmas!
Monthly fav plz
Your videos are so boring! You’re too old to make beauty videos 🙀🙀🙀
Kandee is amazing at whatever she puts her mind to...I thought the whole “popularity” status was a high school thing.
I Know you have a bunch of make up, but you look , like 18..not 28..18...and i'm not the type who eggzaturate--love from Croatia
Anyone else think Kandee sounds like Lollie from Orange is the New Black?
I bought the treat lip balm because of you like 7 years ago.  I still have it and use it all the time. It’s on my night stand and do the same around my eyes and lips before bed.  You were the first YouTube video ever when I was trying to get my skin under control and remember your lemon face video and the Burt’s bees fig scrub you used to use.  You’re still my fave.
When did you start injecting your lips?
Makeup video
What happened to the Everyday Disney Princess tutorials!? Those were the best!!!
Tf?
I’d love monthly favorites! Still my favorite videos!
My mom went to high school with this chick and just saw her on Facebook and it turns out she has more subscribers than the biggest youtubers in our entire state so that’s cool. Also kandee is 40 for those of you who don’t know
It's my dream to get one of ur hugs kandee
That is so amazing you have been doing YouTube  for 10 Years! I just started my channel and you are such an inspiration to me!! Love you! Thanks for all the amazing videos!!
I like favorites but no tea no shade, this seemed like an easy video to make. Like I get it and you’re an OG on YouTube. Things aren’t what they used to be for sure, but I miss more thought out, creative content. Just saying. Congratulations on your milestone though.
God save us all.  Make this ur last video ever.  Please for the live of God.
******imPRESS nails! Life changing! They just stick on, and stay for weeks! Try try try! *********
♥️♥️♥️
Monthly favorites plzzzzzz
Where are you Kandee???
Omg why is this in my feed.... so much going on in the world! So shallow and pointless, who cares?! How do u talk about yourself and your favourite materialistic things in your purse, for 28 minutes! Get real!
More everyday princess looks. Snow White, Mulan, Rapunzel, Tiana, Merida, Elsa, Anna, and Moana. Natural eye with vampy plum purple lip. How to minimize pores and wrinkles. How to properly apply pencil eyeliner smoothly on top and bottom (cause I can’t do very well to save my life.)
hey girl we love u too you look amazing can u make a video about this look i mean both  makeup and hair 
lots of love from morocco 👏🤗
I bloody love favorites videos!! I’d love to see “makeup fundamentals” and then do base, face powders, eyes, and lips - each with multiple styles! Like in the base video, show light coverage, medium coverage, matte, dewy, etc ❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🎄! I hope you and your family have a wonderful Christmas!
You are literally, literally , I am not exaggerating in the slightest - the prettiest, most perfect-faced human I can think of. Don't get me wrong, I'm born and raised in LA, I used to be at the Playboy mansion every weekend for nearly a decade surrounded by beautiful women, I know plenty of beautiful girls... but like, HOW is it humanly possible to be allowed to have a face this perfect like it pisses me off lol. The fact that you're also the sweetest thing ion the world doesn't make it better. If you were a b!tch, I could just hate you and not feel bad. But nope. You get to just get up and walk around being you while the rest of us have to get up and walk around being us, lol. Noooo I just wrote a paragraph about a chick's unrelenting hotness I'm being such a neckbeard ahh no
You should take down all of your videos cause you've been on YouTube for along time. Now you should use social media
You look so much prettier without orange hair !
What is happening with your mustache line on your lips?
You mean your only video 🙄
I love your personality. You are a Christian?
You are not even posting anymore. You are a spoiled Cali person who doesn't even get how government affects you. Just stop on Twitter on matters you obviously don't understand.
Kandee died  weeks ago
Love the center part. Very Boho! You are beautiful inside and out. Love to see how your fame never changes your precious heart.
You always look amazing and I’m obsessed with those sparkle pants!! ❤️
That look is super Gwen Stefani Rock Steady vibes! I’m obsessed ❤️❤️❤️
I mean, how can you not love this woman? Always remarkable.
You look amazing either part
You are gorgeous in any hairstyle! Glad you were safe from the fires. I was super close also. 😘
Giiiiirl do you like not age?! You look amazing!
You look good in anything💕
I just love her reactions with everything in the gift bag 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm a makeup artist in peru having an awful lupus flare, feeling everything is crumbling and in my deepest sadness. Somehow the last seconds of your video made me smile, dry my tears away and just keep going. Thank you so much
Yessssss Kandee the centre part is FIRE!! <3 <3
You're gorgeous no matter what  but I like the natural part... But lady, you could rock a bald head... ♥️
You truly seem like the NICEST, most sweetest person! 💕💕💕💕
love you kandee!!!!💖💖i love the center part!🌈🌈
I think the side part almost always looks better on everyone. Very few people can pull off the center part in an attractive way.
You're awesome Kandee! I love the centre part and it's nice to see more companies that are cruelty free getting some press 🐕🐕🐕💕💕💕
I love the middle part on you; but you always look beautiful.
I always wanted to part my hair in the middle, like always, but each time I would I felt like my nose was too big, and it would always just emphasize it. Your facial structure fits the down the middle parted look!!
Kandee you deserve everything they give you in your gift 🎁 bag and more 💜💕 you are the sweetest !!! You look like Barbie doll 🙏🏻✨ God bless you for giving the world your light ✨✨✨😀!!
Well, I think you'd be beautiful if you didn't have a hair on your head, Kandee. This was a fun video. Blessings, and love..MaryEllen
Hi Kandee I love your videos.  I am 51 and not feeling very pretty as I am getting older and don’t like the way I look.  My biggest dream is to have you do my makeup to bring out  the best in me...this would make my day but  the chances are slim but I hope to meet u one day.  Keep up the great work. You are beautiful.
Ohmygosh, middle parts are so cute, but every time I try, I end up subconsciously switching it back to a side part throughout the day😂
I love your excitement in your videos. Your hair looks amazing any which way you wear. Just wear it how ever you want it..is your hair and you deserve to be happy looking in the mirror everyday. You got me so hype.. I want to go film now. Making these dreams come true one video at a time...🤗😘💞😁
I love u so much kandee!
You look stunning!!! 😍😘💓😍😘💓
Her outros make me cry lol
I love how excited and appreciative you were of everything! You are precious. The center part looks great btw ❤
I just love how genuinely happy you are. It's so great seeing you cheesin' hard! 😁😁😁 It looks like such an amazing experience hun! 💕💕💕
Good grief you’re gorgeous! I could only wish to look 1/2 as beautiful as you in 5 years...whatever your secrets are share!!! 😬
Best swag bag EVER!🥰🤩😍 Definitely gonna be hard to top that one & #Sephora always sets the bar high anyways, quality is Sephora👌🏼💯💁🏼‍♀️
U R A QUEEN DARLING...U R A GODDESS OF BEAUTY...U R A FASHION STATEMENT MAKER....U DO WHAT U WANNA DO DARLING...WE LOV U.❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Aww, you were one of the first youtubers I watched. Love and miss you.
Stunningggg😭❤️😭❤️
Side and middle part are good on you
I don’t think you should change your part permanently but I do really like the middle part on you, it looks great (since you asked)
Your are so sweet kandee! I love your little sayings at the end, it makes me so happy to know there’s such a kind heart spreading happiness so often like you do!!! The middle part is def so cute! (I think I’m biased for side part because I wear that too!) but I think it looked awesome with the outfit you wore
And I like the center part and the side part!!!
You're rxn is so cute when you see yourself in the pink star mirror, which BTW: WANT. 🌟
Those pants!!! Yes!! You look good with the middle part, but I do prefer the side part on you.
Both the middle and side part look great, but personally (as a side parter myself) you rock the side part. 💕
So much fun!  .. I'm in favor of side parts myself (that's my personal go to hair part)  but of course you still look beautiful either way!  It's always fun to play around different styles.  😊  p.s., I'm so relieved your house survived; still praying for everyone..the sky is smoky here in norcal too.
"Charlot Tilberry" I am dying everytime :D
Kandee I was watching Skin Wars Season 3 & I got all excited & screamed when you were on the show I was like that’s Kandee she is awesome woohoo

The center parting looks good, but the side parting looks better.  What a swag bag!  Sephoria looked like a lot of fun.  I'm hoping they decide to do one one the east coast, specifically NY.

Love the center part on you!💕
You look beautiful with both hairstyles but I personally prefer the side part :) 👩🏼
You always look beautiful, Kandee but I am a big fan of the side part and not so much the middle! Lol. 🥰🥰🥰
Love the blonde! You could wear a rag mop on your head and still rock it and be beautiful 💕
This was soo much fun to watch!!! Love you Kandee!! 🍊♥️

I LOVE the center part on you!  You are as beautiful as always, but it's fun to change it up a bit sometimes, right?
I’m so glad you had a great time at Sephoria! It’s so cool how many amazing opportunities you’ve had in the past few years, and I am so happy for you! 😊 I LOVED the hairstyle Chris did for you with the curls and the bobby pins- that looked absolutely AMAZING!!! 😍 As for what hair part I prefer, while the center part looks cute, I do prefer the part you usually do- that’s how I have my hair too! Thanks for sharing your fun experiences, your talents, and your sweet spirit with us. I love and admire you so much!!! ❤️❤️❤️
YESSS THE MIDDLE PART! you look so sophisticated!

Could be my eyes
 
But still great
Gosh you’re such a beautiful person inside and out! 💕
Love, love, love the middle part, looks great on you. Well to be honest, everything looks great on you!!
Center part is ok, honestly you can't do wrong with your beautiful hair!❤ but I like your normal part better
You are awesome!  I felt the love you were sending out.  Thank you!
You looked amazing both days, sweet girl!   Throw that center part in every once in a while to change things up, and see if it doesn’t grow on you.   You are stunning always! 😘
Love the middle part
I like you with either part. 🤣
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG that looks like a Wonderland!!!! I am obsessed with Juan and Chris I instantly followed them! So wonderful to see you! Love you!
Oh god! I need to go there! Was it a one off or will they be doing it again?? Love the centre part😘x
The natural part is just you!! But the middle part is a nice switch up kandee! You look great. Lots of love😘
It was a pleasure to watch your video. 

Your face/ forehead allows you to pull off both the side or center part, so you do whatever you feel like darling, you’re gorgeous either way 💗
I'm on the fence about to center part. You look absolutely gorgeous either way!! So much love from this girl here in Kentucky 💜💙💜
Ahh yet again the ending line of your videos was just what I needed, thank you ❤️❤️❤️
Kandee you look AMAZING with a middle part! You look good with any color, any style any length, but the middle part is so refreshing, fun and glamorous!
You are the   best  youtuber I listen  to
I liked the center part but if it’s makes you uncomfortable then don’t do it darlin 💕 you’re so cute and excited about all of that swag. Love it!
I like a side part also but on you, either part looks good.  You are just so beautiful & confident. Confidence is what makes anything work for you...
You look amazing with a center part!!!! I say switch it up and just do whatever you’re feeling that day. Don’t be scared of the change because it looks SO. GOOD.
Honestly I love the side part. My hair does the same thing.  My facial structure doesn’t look right in a center part.  I used to rock it when I was a kid though. Your beautiful either way but side part two 👍🏻👍🏻 💕💕🥰🥰😘
I love your natural part, I have the same issue w/my hair as well. You’re gorgeous inside & out, Love you bunches!
Idk what you're saying girl, center part looks so good!!

I love the middle part!
I love you.   Have I been saying Sephora wrong all this time?? You keep saying SephorEEA.   Am I wrong?  
Middle part!! So so pretty
Ha ha! I thought throughout the video you were mis-pronouncing Sephora until I saw the letters on the sign... ❤️🇺🇸💋
I love you, Kandee! Such a beautiful heart 💜
Love the middle part 💕
Kandee I love you and the middle part, gorgeous as always and your kind words at the end of the videos mean more than you know! It can definitely be challenging to see past the dark and rough times.
You look gorgeous with the center part but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the side part on you - it’s your signature look and it keeps you unique!!! Xoxo - shannon w.
Love the middle part!!!!! So pretty on you!!!!
Gwen Stefani Vibes #love
i;m the first and i will always be ........... not really tho but like
The center part looked amazing!
Nice to see Kandee uploading more regularly.
I love the centre part on you 💜
I love your hair every way💕🙏
Omg side part is pretty!  And this Sephora event looks much better than BeautyCon
I love that look! Oh how I wish something like that came to where I live! I’d be soooo happy with just one high end! I love you positivity! It makes you more beautiful than you know!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
You look BREATHTAKING!!! But you are so beautiful I don't think any style could make you look bad.
Do not keep the middle part🚫
Center part hair looked cute.
It’s not that you look better but the center part is definitely a good look on you 💗💗💗
Kandee it sounds like you keep say pronouncing it Sephoreea. Did they change the name?🤔🤪
Yes I love it 😍
I’m not a fan of my center part either, but i heard it’s good for your hair when you switch things up a bit.. I think you looked great with it. 💛
I cannot tell a lie: Your natural part looks 2.1 gazillion times better!  I'm not surprised therefore U hate the centre 1.
LOVE the middle part! I even like it better. I have the same problem with my middle part though so I totally get it. You rock it
Love the center part
You look adorable no matter what
Kandee you look beautiful with a centre or side part 😍 I'm so jealous of everyone who got to meet you, you're my idol and I would love to meet you but I'm all the way in the UK! 💖
Love you Kandee ! and loved that middle part btw ! You looked beautiful !
I think the middle part looks great! I've also always hated it on myself I've been testing it out as well, but I think it looks more mature if that makes sense but in a good way!
Wow always beautiful and so awesome 😄 that place looked amazing n so much fun!!
I love your hair every way you wear it.  You have the ability to wear your hair anyway and it looks good on you.  (My Daughter-in-love is the same way.)  Any color, any cut, any style, bangs, no bangs, straight, curled....it just doesn't matter, you always look beautiful!!!  You could shave your head and still be gorgeous!!!!!
Love the hair you can wear anything but the change is fresh!  God bless
Best hair ever at the event! I love the curls ♥️
That hair part is truly cute. Thank you for the continuous inspiration and emotional support. You deserve such  a wonderful holiday and i hope you have it.
I love the middle part! Makes you look more fierce!
No center part. I have a natural center part and it makes my hair SUPER flat. I love how you do your hair normally.
LOVE YOU KANDEE❤️💗😘🤗🤗🤗
Gurl ur hair looks sooo good in a middle part xx
You just made me cry with your closing... I'm going through a divorce, separated since August,  and you made me feel so much better. Thank you for being the sweetest person on the planet!
Looks so fun! I like the side part personally but it's good to switch things up!
I love the middle part
I think your hair looks adorable on you.
I love you so much!! Your makeup and hair for that event were amazingly gorgeous! And girl you can pull off literally anything! I cannot do a middle part at ALL but its really pretty on you! You can do either and look completely gorgeous!
I love your hair both ways and your makeup was so beautiful Kandee! That bag is a dream come true...have fun with it. You are a sweetheart and I love the way you give us all great affirmations!!!💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟
I actually DESPISE a center part...but you absolutely rocked it!!!!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

Love the center part but the side part is classic Kandee💖
Side part <3 I attended Sephoria on Saturday and it was a blast!!
Center Part is sooo pretty on you!! 💗💗💋
WOW!  So amazing!  Whatever you're doing you look awesome.  Can you do an updated skin care/treatment routine?
Love you!!
Loved this .  I love watching you rise and prosper.  I prefer the side part, but the center part is fun for a change.
Beautiful all around sweet girl 😘
I love the middle part❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ hair goals 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love your side, natural part but the middle part was cute for a change every once & a while! Your hustings is so natural, it seems like u make everyone feel comfortable!
Love the middle part 🙌
You’re like the Dolly Parton of YouTube ❤️
Love the center part!!!!! But u look absolutely beautiful either way!!!!!!! I also love that u are so inspiring and that u say kind words at the end of ur videos!!!!!
I love you in any hair style, but I am not a fan of the center part.  You are such a cute, sweet and true hearted soul.  I love your videos and your generous nature.  You are such a doll.
You should curl  your hair like that that the part that I love
You look beautiful
I love you kandee! 💜
keep it as it is as far as the part goes but dye your hair back to brown PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Looks so much better natural, especially with your dark eyebrows...love you <3
Looking fab girl 🌟🙌🏻❤️
Doesn't she sound like venelope from wreck it ralf, that's so awesome! Like if you agree!
I like both! You should always wear what YOU like best. Love u Kandee!!
You're so beautiful and inspirational.🙌😇 &I love the center part, looks so stunning! Your outfit was soooo cute& Nice swag bag, I'm jelly!😷😉😘 Huge hugs!💞💞💞
Love it 💜
Kandee, your hair looks amazing with both parts, you literally look beautiful all the time, because you're just beautiful as a person, both inside and out, even with everything that's been happening in your life for the last couple of weeks, you've remained positive and optimistic and that's what makes you beautiful! You're an all round amazing, woman, mum, makeup artist, and just human! Huge hugs from my house to yours 😌💕👑✨
Kandee, you're the sweetest💚 I think your hair, parted either way, is very flattering on you! I'm partial to your natural part since that's how I'm used to you, but you should do whatever you want to- have fun!
I hate my hair in the middle too, but maybe we are just stuck. You look amazing always so switch it up from time to time.
Always keep us updated on your journey because you deserve it and we want to see it in a video!!
I think the middle part is absolutely adorable but I also love the side part luckily with your face shape and everything you can totally Rock both
I think both looks good on you
Im obsessed with your center part😍😍😍
I like side part.  You are a beautiful person. I followed you on Instagram.
That makeup artist made her look SO YELLOW! Wtf?!
Love the center part! Definitely throw it in the rotation 😘
So sad you don't do YouTube anymore 💔
Her reaction to everything is so beautiful to see.. such a loving, generous, kind human! 
Love when you post new videos, Kandee! Trying to emulate this wonderful person.. spreading kindness and love and happiness EVERYWHERE!
I say go for the center part for a change. I can't say one looks better than the other. You look great with both 😘
you’re beautiful with a side and middle part girl are you kidding
Hahaha Ellie got the Cheeky Stamp now 😂😂
Love the middle part
I’m loving that center part on you!
middle part > side part all the way! it flatters your face so much more xx
You're beautiful with whatever hairstyle!
I love your hair where its parted on the center. There’s a look of sophistication combined with your very sweet personality. Love you Kandee. ♥️🤗🙏🏻
Loved the center part.
Yay loved this video !!! Share more on here please :) love it 🥰
I think the center part looks as good as your go-to side part. C:
You are gorgeous and can look well either way but, I like the side part. Love all your videos, thanks.
I thought the center part looked great!  That Atelier Cologne is my absolute FAVORITE!  I get so many complements when I wear it!  Thanks for taking us on your Sephoria adventure!
Can you do a house tour please? Dying to see your new place - also you might want to remind your followers to turn their bell on since even though I follow you I didn't see this video until now!  Look beautiful as always!  That event was so cool I wish I could have been - thanks for showing us! :)
I definitely can’t rock a center part, yours looks much better!
Your hair and makeup should make you feel beautiful, so only wear a center part if you love it 💕 I think you look best with a side part but probably because it’s how I know you. You’re stunning either way 🙌🏻
I thought the center part looked great!! I was always hoping you'd do that. I mean maybe you'd like it with a lil more volume but other than that you looked like a Victoria Secret model.. Gorgeous Gorgeous Gorgeous!! <3 <3 <3
You look Stunning with a center part as well as a side part girl. you can rock either. also I neeeeeeed another sit down get ready with me video!!! PLEEEEEASE
Really Love the side part or off center part the best! Of course you do look beautiful with the center part!! There’s nothing like variety😬😊 this uplifting video really helped my day Kandee. Thank you!!!
Omg our gorgeous sister is baaacck!! Btw, you totally rock the off-part, but the middle also looked great!!! I like the off one a but more, but that might just because I'm used to it. Hugs from my house!!!!!!!
I love your gratefulness for all those beauty products even though you could go buy all those you still have so much excitement and thankfulness . This is why I love watching you !
I like your natural side part, personally. But you're gorgeous no matter what, inside and out.
Side part, pls! It's more YOU, Kandee💛but you look great either way💎
Beautiful and loving the center part once in a while!!
I think your regular side part flatters your face more. But still pretty either way!
My FAVORITE hairstyle you’ve ever done!!!!!!
You are such an amazing role model! I love watching you shine! You and Patrickstarr are my all time favorite you tubers because you guys are light shiners and love and are real!
Love your positivity. Every video I watch of you I smile. You’re such a bright light in this dark world.
I love a side part on everyone, but you are just so sweet and lovely you can where any part.
I don’t understand that you don’t have nearly as many views anymore ! 
You’re channel is one of the best 
Then I look at all those jokers and they have 18 millions within a year 
Freaking crazy
Omg, you look maaziiiing! They are really artists!! well done, Queens!
Love both!! Center part is sooooo gooooood though 😍
I love your hair either way what ever you like is fine😊
I love it. But you look  lovely either way.
Love you so much Kandee.
I love the hair in the middle 💝🇵🇷😘
And still u look stunning
Kandee you are a QUEEN❤️
You to old to have a kids bedroom lol
Center part, YES!!
love the center part
I loved the makeup and hair but I don't like them on you, I feel they make you look older. I surely prefer the way you do your makeup and hair
I like the middle part!!
Either part but I can think that center part looked awesome on you!!
I love the center part on you🧡🧡🧡🧡
Center part all the way!
you always look amazing
My 7yr old daughter said you look beautiful! And you do. Course then she asked if I was jealous. Used it as a teaching lesson & told her “no. One person’s beauty and success doesn’t diminish someone else’s.” ❤️❤️❤️❤️
no center part
LOVED the center part
You are amazing!!!
I wouldn't of even noticed if you didn't say anything...
Can you do one that's more detail of the makeup and colors? Btw I LOVE your look from that night
Sweet swag! I used to work there as a manager and girl...the gratis was off the hook. I’d get that every two weeks! Was sick and I miss it lol
I think you look beautiful with the side and center part. You're gorgeous no matter how your hair is, it's kinda hard for a beauty le you to look bad. And omg! That sephora swag bag was every-thing! I want one too!
Now we all know why you don't let anyone else do your makeup. Yeah, no. Never again. And for the record, I like any "part" on you but every stylist wants me to part down the middle and it's not just "me." Ha. xoxoxo
Love the centre parting in your hair definitely wear it again. Big hugs x
Dude doing your hair is gay lol
I think you’re beautiful with either part in your hair. But my preference is the same as yours. I like a side part best.
You look good in both hairstyles Kandee! But like you I prefer the side part 😊
You know, dang it if you can't carry off any look you want and look gorgeous. Kinda not fair😁
The middle part is stunning u rocked it
Wonder if she ever gets to meet Rihanna :O Wow
You’d look gorgeous bald! I think you rocked the center part. I have never worn my hair parted down the center either & we are about the same age. Maybe it’s something to do with our generation?! 😂🤣
I cannot believe that gift bag SWAG!!! I die 💀 💜
Kandee, you look stunning with your hair parted down the center. You're beautiful no matter what
I tried the center part and could not make it work!! It doesn't look bad but I dig the side part👐👐👐
What an amazing gift bag. I’m not crazy about the center part that you would like beautiful in anything. I really miss you without extensions. I love your natural dark hair and also your short hair with the crazy colors
Natural part. <3
I just can't believe how far you've come. Started watching your videos wayyyy back when you filmed in a tiny room with a crappy camera (you have deleted the oldest videos now, but that's okay). You were (and still ARE) such an inspiration! ❤️
You look great in anything and the middle part is cute!! Gotta say I love those red slides...  Going to havfta steal the bobby pin look but it may not show up well on dark hair. Lucky you for all those awesome products.
Kandee i think you are ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY GORGEOUS!!!!! I personally LOVE the center part i think you look more chic the side part looks a little dated but YOU ARE GORGEOUS both ways!!!!!! People look at you and can't believe the face on you!!! You should be called "The FACE" a beautiful face!!!! Your pants are the coolest EVAAAAA!!!!! You always look amaZing and fashionable!!! Your makeup is incredible!!! i would love to see a recreation!! i'm trying so hard to make color on the eyes more wearable and you do it so perfectly!!!
Center part beautiful!
Love you Kandee 🍭 💕
Both styles suit u, miss the pink hair tho, ! Please do a a makeup tutorial on this look! Beaut✌🏻
UPDATED. ROOM. TOUR.
Yes to the center part
Love the center part!!!
You are the epitome of beauty inside and out
I love your hair with a side part, but the center part was nice for a change.
I love the center part
I love the center part
The center part looks great on you! I am the same way. Used to center part my hair (before I used to “do” my hair. That is what it naturally does. But then have done a side part for 10 years now. I have tried to do a center part and it just feels so weird to me!! I might try it out again after this. Great job stepping out of your comfort zone 👍
I loovvveee the middle part on you!
Love the middle part!! I think side parts are the “play it safe” option so I love when I see ladies sport a middle part. Like oh she knows what’s up
I love the center part. Super cute on you.
You’re seriously amazing and I love the center part but you look stunning no matter how you part your hair
LOVED the center part
Love the center part on you😊
LOVE AND YOU
That bag of makeup is everything 😍😍😍😍 you looked like you had so much fun!!!
I love the center part Kandee!!!
I love the middle part
I didn't notice 300 bobby pins in my hair....
You looked beautiful!!
Gwen stefani vibes always
you could never look bad 😅
Love the hair 😍
I love the center part hair !
I like both hairstyles, the other is unusual but I like it :D
I love your center part way better 😘😘😘
The center part was not bad. I'd throw it in for a little change now and then.
Too old to have such long hair
I love the Center part! I like it more than the side part!
I think out of all of your hair colors, blonde is def my favorite.
I hope you and your family are safe!!  This past week has been rough!
My sister hates when I wear a center part, but I've kinda just learned to embrace it.
You look beautiful in a middle part!
Kandee you would look gorgeous bald!
I’m obsessed with you as a blonde and either part is amazing!
Yes to center part!  Show us some of your favorite things!  I really miss those videos!
You’re so lucky! I want to get in contact with you somehow! Don’t see you on Snapchat anymore... I hope you’re doing well. I’m getting back into makeup and skincare and my skin hasn’t been this amazing since high school. I love your videos and I’m so happy you’re still doing stuff on here!
Your eyes are so huge 💗💗 Juan did an amazing job!!!
He gave you Trisha Paytas hair, you totally rocked it!!
You always look pretty no matter what hair you have . But I think in general the center part is not flattering on anyone.
Makeup tut pleaseeeee 🤩😍
I looks really pretty on you, not better. You would look beautiful with burnt puke colored bob. Let’s be real.
Your hair looks great whether you do the center part or side part (I’m a side part girl myself). 🤗❤️
I hate middle parts. I part my hair like you and I middle parted in high school over 10 years ago and omg what was I thinking!
I love the center part for a change but you rock both looks.
❤️ you positivity it really helps others so keep it up: That is the most amazing swag bag ever !! Was there different levels of tickets ? Did you have to pay to enter and each of the booths did you have to buy the ysl lipstick to get engraved ?  Not sure if ai will get answered I hope so this might be an event I want to attend next year ❤️ ❤️
I told you on your Instagram, I love your hair with the middle part. I wish you’d mix it up and swap parts according to your outfit and makeup. You are gorgeous inside and out, you are just such a beautiful person.. I love watching your videos and I’m 57!!!
What do I think about this hair? Kandee I think you can rock aaaaanythinngggg
KANDEE..you are so luck to look great in so many styles and colors.  I think you should keep the center part as an option.  Sometimes the center part just goes with the outfit, sometimes not.
Either way you always look AMAZING! My hair naturally parts in the middle even when I style it to the side by a few hours later it's back to in the middle..ugh! I'm just LOVING your vlogs so MUCH! That Sephora gift bag was way BEYOND GRACIOUS 💖💖💖 I❤U
Middle part was kinda weird. Yeah I said it. Maybe doing it as a brunette would be better?   Btw. You always look amazing  but the middle part made me .... uncomfortable. 🤣
Kandee let’s try the center part I’d love to see it on you, you look amazing as always my dear 💋💋💋
Kandee I Need you to do holiday shampoo an conditioner again!!!!!! I am been low key waiting
That lip color and makeup look the artist did on you was beautiful
I love the middle part on u!
The middle part makes you look younger!! Prettyy!!
You always look fantastic on the outside, clothes, makeup, hair...always perfection....but what shines through from within, your energy, your sparkle, that you-ness...that's what pulls the rest to a pinnacle of unattainable self expression that so many long to draw even near to. This video made my week :)
LOVE IT!!!
love both parts but i like the center part better
When it comes to your hair you should mix it up. That bag was so cool. Now you should do a video showing how so of that works.
I love the middle part!!!!
I like the middle part, but the side part is more "you". :) I'm a side part lady too. Haha
That swag bag 💓💓💓
I am a side part and believe that is more flattering on you
Awesomesauce! Love you Kandee!
Lol I’ve always been a center part. Side parts do not look good on me no matter what I do or how hard I try!
You looked good, but leave the center part. I’ve never been into center parts.
I wish I could go to these things lol
OMG that looks so funnnnn!!!!
No center part
I prefer a side parting xx
I think the side parting is Better i love it
Hi, my mom Kim knows you and says hi
I just got done watching your Fourth of July violent lip tattoo
Kandee’s Outro’s are always so heartwarming
Kandee, you are beautiful no matter how you wear your hair. You just be you!
I love you kandee
I love the middle part!!!!
Imho it's gotta be side part
ur the best kandee!
HELLO BABY
Center part or no! They both look amazing! Plz do a look with red lips!!!
4:16 mark. Her face cloned....
Middle part!!!
I’m diggin the center part.
Your sooo pretty kandee love ya xxx
I vote for the side part!
You look good no matter how you wear your hair
Love to you Kandee. ❤️⚓️
Can you please please please help me with exposing rahat for what he ddi wrong
That Sephora gift bag is heavenly ....... I’m a side part gal but am always switching it up
I’m likterally just obsessed with everything you do. You’re such an inspiration ❤️
Omg that’s me at 5:19 it was so nice meeting you you looked beautiful!!!!!
How old are you I want to get in them cheeks
You makeup better than the guy that did it for you. And, you are so gorgeous.
Love love love the middle part on you!!
Lol I love excited you get over the swag bag.. like, you prob get sent stuff all the time.. but you still get excited when you are given makeup. I loved the center part too!
Honestly, I love your hair shorter.  I don't understand because you get a cut new style and POOF! in 2 secs you've put extensions back in with the same look.  I'd like you to leave it short and show styles as it grows out!
I like the side part!😆😘
Try out the center part for a little while & then alternating regularly and this is important cuz I was the same way about my “go-to part” & as I starting hitting my 30s I noticed thinning &/or receding hair line in that area of my “go-to part” (think about how many years you’ve been parting your hair in same spot, the years & years of gravity, stress, styling, products & exposure of the environmental elements & pollution, that’s a lot of long term duress when you think about how long it’s been) & so I was advised (between my stylist & dermatologist) to alternate the areas in which I part my hair. Good news is the thickness of my hair returned in time but bad news is the older you get the less likely that is to happen so remember early intervention is key👌🏼 meaning the sooner you start these preventive measures the better chance you’ll have of achieving your desired goal. So kinda like you know how in some countries they start their girls on a skin regimen very young so that by the time they get to the adult age range of skin beginning to show wrinkles & signs of aging the anti aging preventive maintenance they’ve been doing since they were younger actually works in their later years. Most anti aging products recommend using them before you even get signs of aging or wrinkles anyways. 
I just only wish someone would’ve given me this advice when I was a teenager but at least now I can teach my daughter who is now 10yrs old & I already have her practicing hair & skin care regimen. I taught her how & made her a little gentle & simple regimen for her hair & skin (we stick with vegan products so no worries about harmful ingredients). And best part is I know for sure she’s gonna thank me someday when she gets older & begins aging beautifully into her later years😉 
how can anyone not love you! you make me so happy watching your videos <3 I hope you are getting on well in your house after that awful evacuation, sending you all the love and support xoxoxo
Middle part is the bomb! So pretty Kandee!!!
I think the middle part looks nice, but really, it's what you think - if you hate it, don't wear it! :) I would LOVE to see James Charles glam your face, fyi!!
I love the center part on you Kandee! But I know how you feel, because I have the same weird feeling about it on myself as well.
Lovveee the middle part!!!!
I love the center part on u!
Side part looks good middle part looks good what matters is that you feel good too, you do you Kandee!
Anyone notice how cute Kandee says "Sephoria" instead of "Sephora"? It's Kandee, she can say anything wrong and it sounds better than the original! She's so beautiful and her personality makes her the GODDESS that she is! I love her inside and out! She's AMAZING!!

Edit: I just noticed the bag itself says "Sephoria". Still, when Kandee says it, it sounds better!😉
Yes center part!!
Its just a hair part just like its ( just make up ) while I do see the difference it does to your face and while you might question that... change is great and its not permanent so just do what you want at the end of the day and thanks for always being beautiful inside and out!
I’m sure I’ll get flack, but I think it should be acceptable to give criticism just as much as praise. 
I’ve watched you evolve, change yourself and your channel the last year or so and it seems like you’ve lost the reason you started doing this. It doesn’t seem like you are the same genuine Kandee I used to love so much. I miss the sweet, more genuine days before all of the “over the top” trends that you’re beginning to emulate. I’m sad.
I do like the center part on you!
You look stunning in either parting... please tell me what is your lipcolor and makeup please!
The center part is just another option. Just as stylish
I used to hate the way I looked in center part hair... I had it all the time as a kid... When I was 16 I started to have side part, and kept it for years.. But now the two last year I have been having center part... And I like it 😄 it grows on you 😄
Putting a puke emoji and titling your video focused on hating a hairstyle?  Poor form.
I like the center part!
No on the center part
💕😘🥰
I like the center part.
We love it.
Wait! The bag says Sephoria!! What?????
You are such an inspiration. I’ve been watching your videos for so many years - a throwback Kandee fan, dating back to Chicago Glaminars 😍 and even before. You are a beautiful person. You uplift people without even realizing it. I am grateful for you. You’ve gotten me through a lot of dark and troubling times and I thank you for that. I wish you nothing but happiness and light. The funny thing is...I don’t wear an ounce of makeup lol. I’m literally just here for you. XO 😘
I’m loving the blonde!
Middle part short nape length assymetrical bob black is your look it would look great on you
Center part looks better!
I do not like the middle part. I like the side part
I love your centre part, my hair does it naturally and i hate it as i look like a potato!!!!
💕💕💕💕💕
I like the centerpart
Please do this eyeshadow as a tutorial. How many colors made this look?
Did anyone else see the face appear when she turned her head and said where r u? I was like WTF was that!
💟
Yesssss. Kandee video 👸
OMG BILLLLLIIIIEEEEE
Your hair “Shrunken”? Middle part this style looks pretty but your dark roots are showing and it kinda takes away from the beautiful bobby-pin design he created. Makeup looks amazing the lipstick and liner really make your lips look fuller definitely gives the appearance that you have had lip fillers. The magic of makeup it’s totally amazing. Your makeup artist sounds like a female I thought he was before I saw him on camera. Lol question do your children ever get to go with you and experience seeing their mom at these events? I think they would really one day enjoy being there and seeing their mom in action and especially seeing how much everyone loves you I bet that would make them feel even more proud that you are their mom! I know when I spent the day with my dad at his job it truly touched my heart to see how loved and respected he was it made me even more proud to be his daughter! I don’t know how many children you have or their ages but I think at any age they would enjoy watching their mom in action! :) !!!
Middle part!
Orange
Another sponsored video, Damn the last video was you trying to sell us something.
What happen to your lips??!!!
I like the center part too
Looove the hair Kandee
Did someone see the face that appears next to Kandees face at 4:15??? spooky👻
Very Kardashian hair. Cute tho.
1st!
What's with the illuminati Satanist all seeing eye over the name Sephora? The single eye is a symbol meaning they have given their allegence to satan for success.  Are there any companies that don't have that evil sign nowadays.  Illuminati run the pedophile rings through out the world.
Kandee if any YouTube artists deserves this it’s you! You have a heart of gold and I wish you all the best! Big hugs and kisses!
Did anyone else find the random face at 4:06???? Holy freaky comment below if you saw it!! It’s next to Kandee
Kandeeeeee, you look like a star with any hairstyle and color. But puh-leeeeeease just go brunette, get the extensions out, cut a lob and give your hair a break.
Wish youd go back to more natural. You're very quickly looking plastic and Dallas Housewifeish. What standard are you setting for your daughters...
Trisha Paytas vibes!
I love u  kandee u are wonderful person every time I ur videos it calms me down for some reason I don’t know why but it does help me when u say something on here u doing ur thing
Warum sieht sie so anders aus....;(
Talking about hair. The first time I discovered you was watching your video on how to cut your own bangs lol.
I Can't put my finger on why.... out all I was thinking was trisha paytas
No center part, please.  And may I just say, you look amazing in those long, Draper, glittery slacks!  Legs for days!
You're exactly the right woman to handle this. Nintendo good choice,she is really amazing 🌷
Luigi scared the crap out of me 😂
Omg her as Luigi is so funny.
You should turn into Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones next!
You amaze me 😍 love you!! 💕💕
Kandeeeee!!?? You had me cracking up with the Luigi! You are such a light that shines so bright.. You literally just made my entire month. Well I should say 2 months since Nov just started! #superfan
I miss your transformations!!!!❤❤❤❤
I love this so much!! You make the perfect Princess Peach!!!! 💖💖💖
Yeah you’re NOT supposed to put them in inside out!!!!! They have to go the other way or they will reject.
My childhood dreams are thriiiiivinggggg 💕🎀💕🎀 soo cute !! As if I wasn’t already girly enough. 💁‍♀️💁‍♀️

"Oh my gosh, you guys, it's coming together," -- every cosplayer knows this exact moment and you just feel so excited haha, so proud of you, Kandee!
You did such an amazing job in this video.. loved it and your positivity. You inspired me to follow my dream and start my channel. I can only hope to be as good as you. Never better because luv you are one of a kind. 🤗💞😘

This is wonderfully brilliant!  I so look forward to your videos, they bring me SO much joy!  Since my father's passing, I just feel off.  Generally, when I need to find a bit of joy (especially when it's in middle of the night), I come to YT for beauty videos, and I always keep my fingers crossed hoping to see one of yours!  I loved your work as Princess Peach, but your work as Mario is stellar!!!  Love you so very much!  Thank you for spreading joy wherever you go!!!  :-)
Omg I have missed your videos!  It seems like forever since you popped onto my feed.
Love you Kandee! I’ve been praying for you & your kiddos! 🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑

Luigi gives me life 😂
Omg!  Your BEST transformation since your Barbie one!  👌✨...LOL, "Louigi" describing your contacts placement/crying makeup off..😂😆💙
it's not a transformation (maybe more of an origin story) but I'd love to hear your ancestry test results! :) xoxo
Love your channel and all your videos kandee! You are such an amazing person! Your personality and positivity is such a breath of fresh air on YouTube. Keep up the amazing work!!
That's super awesome Nintendo reached out to you for this and you picked Peach (she does kick butt in super smash bros) 
I hope you do more video game based transformations because this one was pretty cool to watch(and the contacts part reminded me of when I was first getting the hang of false eyelashes where nothing falls into place like its supposed to😂😂😂)
Luigi “even-a-me!”
Do a Sailor Moon transformation!!! You would rock that!
I miss your uploads so much!! you are wonderful and beautiful and brilliant!!!
Peach is my literal favorite character I play with her on every Nintendo game
10 years ago, I would wake up at 5 a.m. before school to watch these 💕
Luigi has a great manicure! xoxo🙏
Ily kandee!! I've missed you 💜😘💕
Bellatrix Lestrange!!!:)
Loved Luigi’s natural eyes
Best video ever! Love this!
This is my favorite makeup transformation EVER💖💕🌸🌈
Awesome Kandee!!! Please do Nebula from GOTG!!!💋💋
Loved it! You looked just like her!!💞

You trying to get in your car had me cracking up 😂
🎤🎵Where are my happy days?
They seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good🎵

🎵So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me?
S.O.S.!
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S.!
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?🎵

🎵You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love?
It used to be so good🎵

🎵So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me?
S.O.S.!
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S.!
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?🎵

Solo

Omg! Kandee you are so amazing and talented! Peach has been one of my favorite Nintendo characters since I was little. This video is awesome!😍
I loved this transformation!!! 💗
Can we talk about the arm muscles she's got while trying to put the wig on?! Your hard work is showing off girl!! Sending so much love from my house to yours, and sending it protecting vibes! I wish I could send the snow down there to stop the fires. Love you so much! <3

You're my childhood dream come true! I wanted to be her as a kid and still do lol Nintendo, u picked the right girl! Love u kandee 🤩
You should do this again sometime and make your sister into princess Daisy!! Great sister costume idea!
Little advice for a next time you will be  putting in contacts... put the mirror flat down on your table and bow your head over it... hugs and kisses from the Netherlands!
PERFECT
omg you are so quirky, fun and real! I just found you through this whole Smash promotion thing and I'm glad Nintendo chose you
Amazing! If you ever do any of these again, Zelda is the beautifullest.
My daughter request that you do yoshi's. Thank you and I love you!!!!!!
This video was so cute and the transformation was amazing!?!?!

Btw I love when you do a monthly favorites video!! I use to get a lot of the stuff you recommend and loved all of it! And I'm so excited for your purlisse collaboration!!!!!! ahhhh (:
🍑🍑🍑 love you Kandee!! I loved what you said about your Dad and wanting to talk to him and then hearing those songs,  it's not a coincidence, he's watching over you! Stay safe ♡♡♡
PLEEEAAASSE TRANSFORM INTO DAISY BEXT LOV U😍
Awesome job as usual Kandee! Praying for you and kids. You’re an real inspiration. 👸💪❤️
If you do one before Christmas, may be Cindy Lou Lou from the Grinch, or Mrs. Claus.
Would/could you transform into Elon Musk?
Whoa! Botox and the lips! Looking different.
I am Italian and your accent was legit realistic!! My niece and nephew are waiting for me to finish typing as they anxiously await your video!!
Wow, that was an awesome transformation, Kandee! Great job, and how fun that you had an event to go to in costume!  😊 Love youuuu!
Please do more of these tutorials! More video game girl characters!
Love this! My 5 year old son was also a huge fan of this video. He loves anything Mario related. He said "that girl is so beautiful" 👑🍑💓
🍑 I love everything about this video. Your best transformation video by far and funny. I love the addition of Mario. Thank you for putting in all the effort you do to entertain us with little to no sleep and even having to evacuate your home and move 5 times you still manage to finish editing and uploading a video for us. I appreciate you, your work and wish you a safe and peaceful life especially now with the fires. 🍑🍑❤️❤️
Great job Kandee!  You are so talented!  Nintendo got it right choosing you!  Also, loved Luigi...so cute!!! 😊😊😘
how does she look so good without eyebrows!? <3 loved the look with white eyeshadow and liner, before it turned into lashes. <3
This was so much fun to watch! I laagheden so much with your Luigi 🤣 And you are such an amazing artist! I think this is my second fave transformation you did my first being the Barbie one! 💖 als you in just the wig from the side reminded me of Dolly Parton 😅
Something Silent Hill related? Maybe Alessa? You know to fit  the gamer vibe
I love this video so much! You are awesome, talented, and super funny! The mis-numbered steps and Luigi were my favorite.
Damn she had the dress and everything
Luigi counting the steps 😂😂
LOL!!! You are the BEST!!! Love you soooo much!!! You are so creative and so much fun 🥰
Hahahaha I love your Luigi !
You are so freaking adorable !!!!! This entire video made me smile lots.
Yes mama my favorite player peach 🍑
You could totally transform into Princess Zelda!!!
Wow this was amazing I've never really seen ur channel I subscribe to u and I cant wait to see more amazing things from u😘🤗😊💖👄xo
Need to block the eyebrows more but everything else is amazing !
I can't believe you turned into Peach so well!! :D
(Daisy voice) You're the winnnnnerrrrr! Good job Kandee!
Awww I love u more kandee!!!!!  How sweet you took the time to read and respond to my comment !!! Popular ytubers never do that!!!!!  God bless you!!!
You should dress like Ariel next
Hey Kandee ILYSM🍑🍑🍑
Zero Suit Samus
Your Princess Peach transformation was incredible! If you do another Super Mario transformation do Princess Rosalina. 😊
Are you doing a christmas housetour this year?
That was different.
She sacrificed her eyes for this
Thinking of you Kandee ... Prayers to you and your family ❤️⚓️
With holidays coming, I think Cindy Lou Hoo would be cute for a transformation
As soon as I saw this video I called my kids (5 and 6 y/o) to come watch and we loved it!
Haha this is great!!  I loved it!!  Terrific job Kandee!  Transformations are definitely a special thing you do!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Luigi has blue nails lmaooo
I do not kow this character, did not play Mario much, but WOW - this time I cannot ieven recognize the real shape of your face! amazing, Kandee! Perfecy disguise!
Ohhhh myyyyy gosh Kandee!  This is EVERYTHING!  Peach til I die!  Luigi is so funny!  Great job!  Nintendo definitely picked the right person!
Bayonetta. Also, love the Peach Transformation. Every detail is gorgeous
The transformation video quality and editing were so garbage I almost couldn't finish the video. Let the makeup speak for itself! You don't need to zoom in and sacrifice video quality!!!!
My favorite! Princess Peach!!! 👑 🍑 💕
If I didn't know any better I would've thought this was actually her.
You're so talented!!! Like all of your transformations - this one is flawless!
I just-a spice things up a little bit 😂😂😂 that Luigi cameo alone is why I love you!! 💚💚💚 I LOVE this transformation!! Low key trying to convince my husband for us to be princess peach, mario & luigi for next halloween!!
Here is my recommendation daisy, the inking from splatoon , zero suit samus or zelda
Oh my gosh this may be one of my favorite videos ever!!! Too too funny! You look amazing! Also, I wear contacts everyday and one of the easiest ways to get them in is to make sure your hands are wet!
This video is so much fun! So cool that you got to go to a costume event! Hope you had a great time! Glad to see your Mom and Luigi is so funny! "Step 1000!" 😂
Luigi was so funny!
Transform into Bowsette next!!
You should transform into the bent neck lady from the haunting of hill house
Wow!!!! Just discovered you and I am so glad I did. I left smoke trails hitting that subscribe button!!!
As a daily contact wearer you cannot turn them inside out bc they are shaped perfectly to fit your eye, so when they are flipped the shape becomes distorted and generally hurts or is uncomfortable to an extent. But i digress, Amazing transformation!! <3
Kandee, beauty on so many levels. This is the kind of pick me up we need during a week that has been a nightmare for so many Californians.
Lara Croft! That would be awesome!
yeeeees go peach! #teampeach
Best video ever!
U look so cuteeeee!!!!
I missed your videos and your fantastic transformations Kandee!!!!
Love it! Wished you did the voice too lol
Yeassss been waiting for this!!!! Yay! Don't worry i can't put in contacts either ah
You look like Dolly Paltron!!
In looovveeeee 💛
I need a Luigi in my life as running commentary hahahahaha
You are amazing!!!
Kandee please do a makeup tutorial on your look in the beginning of the video
it’s so beautiful
How about Rainbow 🌈 Brite
OMG!!! How many times I played Mario Kart I used Peach or Wario lol And I love Luigi haha that was a hoot! I loved this Kandee, hmm for another maybe try and do Daphne from Scooby Doo!!!!!!! Loved to see her, or even one of the Josie and the pussycats :) xoxo <3
SO cute!!
How adorable!!  Next you should transform into Barbie!!  Any princess would be awesome too! I loved this video!
This is so freakin cute!!!
Nintendo Approved
This was awesome Kandee 🙈
Wow I can’t even tell that was u under all lol so awesome! Love it!
Bowsette next?❤❤❤
Go walk into traffic
I Dream of Jeannie. Please.
Who else thinks Kandee's Luigi sounds just like Marzia
Hello there, you are great
Can you transform in to princess daisy next please
hi i love your video a lot have a good day
I loved the video!! I think Luigi was my favorite part! So cute! What a joy! 🤗
You weren't supposed to flip the contacts, that's why they were hard to get in.
Great video! Wonderful job!
Her high kick was my move to finish people off!
Love you videos! Especially the transformations!  I cosplay as Sailor Moon a lot and would love it if you did her!  Princess Zelda is also on my list to cosplay.  Their makeup is pretty simple but I love learning how you contour and shape your face to look like other people/characters! That is where I could use help at!
When she covered her eyebrows after the glue I thought she look like Jeffree Star.
So freaking cute 💕💕😍
Omfg contacts freak me outttt but princess peach is my favorite and I love this video! Wishing you and your family the best right now. Stay strong, like peach! 💖❤️
Your mom is a true Queen, so gorgeous!!! The Nintendo themed music is bringing me back 30 years ago!! So nostalgic
OMG love love this video!!!  Have you ever done a Pinup look before??
Omggg Kandee I dont know if it was my mood but this video ITS SO FUNNYYY!!! Not to mention Nintendo couldn't have chosen a better person !! U gave 200% on this video!! It's so amazing! The costume, the quality, everything. Marvelous... Thanks
Amazing!!!!
"Come inside peache's castle" I think Mario has that  covered
ZERO SUIT SAMUS
Linkle?? Idek 😅😂
I am the 6 comment
Adorable!!! Lmao
Those eyelashes and that thumbnail.. ugh I can't :/
Do danielle fishel transformation
The mad hatter from Alice Through the looking Glass where he getting sick !!!!
Zelda! Pleeease
Omg hahaha yassss!
Great Vid, fun.
Putting contacts in upside down is not a good idea. It’s actually pretty painful.
You totally looked like Yolandi with no eyebrows!
Kandee!!! This was awesome!
can you turn in to a gost buster or a mermaid or unicorn
Please cosplay Callie from Splatoon you look suuuuuper pretty for it!
So fun and loveable as always Kandee🍬🍭🍬🍭!!!  I think you should do a 🐱🐱🐱🐱KatVonD🐱🐱🐱🐱 transformation!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀 (I don't know how many emojis it takes to appear on your radar 😋☺️🤔😆)
is she the one doing Luigi or is it somebody else? wow
💝💝💝👍🏻
+kandeejohnson  Fab cosplay makeover!  On a practical note, I consider the dress limousine material; I woudn't expect my future wife to attempt to control a motor vehicle in a Victorian lower with all its layers.
Wouldn't it be neat if you transformed into a Harry Potter character in honour of the new Fantastic Beasts film coming out?
Omg your sister 😂😂😂😂
8:34 Mario Kart IRL
Love it!!!
Looks like thumbelina as well
I got so excited at first when she started off saying everything that will be on this video..... until I saw it was only a 8:47 min video lol. Still a great job! 👍💕
You should do Princess Rosalina
oh god you look hidious
Luigi, lolol!!
After watching this video, all I can say is: thank God Peach is not a real human being.
😂😂😂 contact prablems!
Take a bit out of this Peach!
So great 👌😘
Flawless!
Looove you !
Love ya
Way cool! Wonderful!
This is so great I love this💕💕💕💕💕I hope your dress fit in the car❤️❤️❤️
Candy you truly are an inspiration, I’m so sorry for the fires in your part of the world & that it’s affecting your family. I live in Scotland & have followed your videos since you were showing how to do t shirts cutting 👚 around 2009 I think. I watch you on snap chat every day & love how positive you are. PS please get more sleep 💤 you’re up all hours & are so busy 😂 xXx
Give this comment thumbs up if you think she should dress up as Jeffree Star 💫 lol 😂
I think maybe Luigi needs counting lessons
Omg kandee love you xxx
Amazing job Kandee!   Love it.  💟💟💟
Where did you get that dress? Were you wearing a hoop skirt underneath?
I love Princess Peach 🤩🤩🤩
Time stamp 5:57 face tone was playing u
Dang that was a quick video
💕💕💕
Love this! But just the false eyelashes were enough, you really didn’t have to draw them on
Omg I’ve missed you SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!! Come back to us with more videos as much as possible :))) we love you!!!!! - Shannon w.
You put your lenses upside down
Perfect!
Joanna Dark with sexy outfit
Kandee, can you do a Princess Zelda transformation next??
I miss the Disney ones kandee!!
Who is this Princess Peach?? It’s Princess Toadstool!!!! 👸🏼🍄

*I was her for Halloween when I was about 6 , favorite costume ever!!
who's scared of peach now?
This is awesome. All I can see is Trisha Paytas though 😂
YES BINCH 😍
Kandee, I love ur lips. Can u make a video on ur experience with lip enhancement? How much it cost, what to be careful with, etc.? If they're natural, I'm sry. Ur very blessed, then. Btw, ur Luigi impersonation is hilarious! 😂
I love it!!!!!!! Kandee you're awesome ❤
Luigi stole the show 😂😂😂
If only Luigis nose were big
Soon freaking CUTE !!!
Do princess daisy (mario series)
Omg do Daisyyy<3
God most beautiful woman ever.
Kandee you are lovely in princess peach !! Amazing !!
ooo you should transform into zss next you’d look like her
💕
Whoooooa freakin AMAZING 😮😮😮
U look like dolly parton and im not mad abt it
Beste Peach Make Up das ich je gesehen habe...Respekt echt wunderschön geworden...🤗
You’d make a perfect Gwen Stefani! You’re voice even sounds like hers. Rock out!!
Ahhhhh!!!! I love this!!! Peach is awesome!
I liked it, but if I'm being honest, I think it would have looked even better if you made the lines around the eyes larger to make them more "manga" style, and then put on a larger contact as well (I know that would have been even harder but still). Only saying this because before the wig I wasn't necessarily getting Peach in the face.
❤️❤️❤️
I cannot tell a lie:  U still look cute w/o makeup.  And girly.
Kandee you’re amazing!!
Waluigi
Where is the wig from??
That is literally me trying to put in contacts
Do daisy and rosalina please!!!!
I’d be so scared to put those contacts in. Lol.
This is a monstrosity
What a poser
Mario
Wow!!!!!
Why did she end up looking like all the white girls at my high school when she finished the face?! Lololol 😂
Why are her videos not getting major views? She deserves it. All the “beauty community” owes it to her. She’s the OG! They wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for her!
AMAZING!
Hey Kandee, hope you and your family are safe and away from the fires. Sending you lots of hugs
Helga  from hey Arnold
Man Kandees videos used to be so good. I used to binge watch her videos like 6 years ago. They are so much more commercial and annoying now :(
Looks very pretty!  😍😍😍😍😍💓💓💓💓💓
Kandee looks like Cameron Diaz with the blue contacts on
Omg those lenses ....
I don’t know why, but you really remind me of Joan Collins when you are all done up at the end. I think it’s maybe those contacts and lashes that does it (or the big puffy shoulders) ❤️
🤣
Princess Daisy! From Mario
This is so awesome! 💗💗💗💗
Princess Paesh👑🍑
This was soooo good 👸🏼xx
Do princess Daisy
Hi
🍑
The beginning felt like a Barbie movie lol
That’s look really nice
Kandee why did u delete ur new video?
baby bowser...yes
Yesss !!!
Best video ! Ever !! So funny lol
I honestly just thought this video was really poorly edited tbh. Sorry not sorry.
I lowkey feel like this was supposed to be a Halloween video lol still love it though
Very drag, Kandee!! Love it.
Thank u so much
So Daisy's next right?
Peach main 4 ever
ok the concept but cute but you executed it horribly. this video should have been longer and the Luigi was slightly annoying
ahhaha how cool, I'm actually making a child's Toad for a costume for a party...
Petfection ❤
Entertaining and spot on 👌
Woahhhhhh
So good
Pauline
Astounding!
That’s awesome!
Have you ever done Jessica Rabbit?
If you want to turn into peach all you gotta do it put on the crown
Creepy
Kandee this is incredible! Congratulations on the Nintendo sponsorship! That's such a big deal! PS your mom is gorgeous!
Just get the super crown
Tell me why Kandee’s Luigi impression sounds like Marzia! Hahaha
I can’t wait to show my daughter when she gets home from school. Princess Peach is her favorite!
You sound like marzia pew de pies gf as Luigi
Transform into Grumpy cat!!!! Hahahaha
Yes love it 😍😍😍
Honaaayyy. You can’t flip contacts inside out...
No tea no shade no lemonade but the final result looks a little less princess peach and a little more dolly parton
Booette.
This was amazing! Your makeup was perfect! And you as Luigi was seriously the funniest thing ever 😂
LOVED IT!
stop
🍑
🦄
whenever she is talking like Luigi she sounds exactly like Marzia Bisognin A.K.A #PewDiePie girlfriend.
uh oh
Anybody else notice most of there rare uploads she does are sponsored?
To do Disney throwbacks, I really would like to see her do the Sugarplum Fairy from the new Nutcracker movie
Rosalina?
Ble
Your awesome
When i was younger the nintendo mario 2 with princess peach was the only mario game i ever beat!!!! Looks amazing kandee!
Wow! Good job
Kandee you are the best!
What about Daisy or Rosalina
Ah my eyes hurt just watching her try to put in the contacts
🍑🍑🍑🍑
Omg !!! It’s sooo cool !!! I love it !
🍑🍑🍑
Bowsette?
LEGENDARY
🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑🍑
🍑
Luigi sounds exactly like Marzia (pewdiepie's gf) lol no kidding
Zelda
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
Vampirina!
omg Kandee i would love if you could get together with Rosanna and do a video where you turn her into like Ursula from the little mermaid or omg u could turn her into you! and you could twin!!!!!
When Rosanna posted her Halloween video I was LOOKING for you, KANDEE! :D PEACHEY!!!
Kandee, you're magic!
Mmmmuuuaaaaahhhh😘😘😘
Such a cute video. Please make sure you get your contacts from a eye doctors office and are fitted properly for them. They are considered a medical device and you need to actually see a doctor to get the right kind of contacts for you or risk losing your eyesight. I never realized the importance of this until I started working in an optometrist office a year ago.
Awesome!!!
Kraina grzybów pozdrawia
Jessica rabbit
What about doing the white queen from Alice in Wonderland? Or Rapunzel? Xx
Nice!
Luigi was annoying and you didn’t learn from your Barbie tutorial that drawing in your lashes litterally looks so bad?
Jesus, all that makeup, fake lips, fake eyebrows and god knows what else is so unattractive. Couldn't get past 30 seconds.
Britney Spears
Soooooo cool. You are definitely the queen of transformations
Cute!!!! Like so cute!!!! I love you Kandee!
I want you to turn into Princess Daisy
Looks like a skinny Trisha Paytas lmao
So cute!
Anyone think she looks like Trisha paytas when her makeup is done?

Loved this just a thing is that you didnt explain what u were doing with the makeup.. So for people who are blind like Molly Burke cant understand a thing...
Wow !
Awesome
Umm..
Favorite transformation by far!!
😍😍😍😍So fun!!
Oh Kandee you made my inner child squeal with this video cause I always wanted to be Princesses Peach for Halloween!! If you do another transformation video could you do Bayonetta? So many videos have been done BUT they’ve all been a HUGE swing & a miss from costumes to makeup but I know you’d hit it out of the ballpark with it!!
😱👏🏻🙌🏼👍🏼👍🏼
👑👛💖 Amazing 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
more like princess thotstool XD
Hello kitty
Um ew
Great work but not comfortable to watch , I mean clips r too fast made me dizzy  🤤
I love u and your talent! ❤️But, way to much effects in the video... kinda hard to see exactly what you’re doing makeup wise... 🙄
OMG....what an amazing video! This look is everything!! I 💖 you Kandee!
who else literally drops EVERYTHING to watch Kandee's videos!?



btw any small youtubers wanna be friends and support each other?💛
You are SO TALENTED AND CREATIVE!! Love you, Kandee!! 💖💖💖
I love this look, but the video made me almost “Sea-sick”? It’s hard to explain, I just feel almost dizzy from watching all the cutting in and out so fast :( But! I love this makeup look! I like how you used the temporary tattoos as a base, and then took the extra step to color them in so it looks more authentic, that’s cute and creative. Love love love that lip color on youuuu! And the pearl eyebrows really pulled it all together! I love you, Kandee!
Kandee you are hands down the most beautiful woman on this entire planet
Amazing look! Love that lip color.  ♥
Getting Gaga vibes!! Yass love this Kandee! 💓💞💓
Love how you filmed and edited this video. Cool look too. 💕
It breaks my heart seeing Kandees views down... all people watch is click bait these days. Kandee is one of the most hard working youtubers and I feel like she doesn't get enough credit 🙁
Kandee I get really excited when you upload a new video! Please keep posting ❤️ I love this look 😍
Your videos are long awaited and much appreciated! Love you Dear Sweet KandeeGirl!🍭
I love this look ! Although I would love it even more with dark red lips. Please do some looks with no pink-and-overcoloured-lips, i.e. dark-red instead, pleaseeeee! Also, the cuts in the edit are a little bit to short and fast for me, it was difficult to focus and see what you are doing , especially in the beginning of the video. Other than that - yes, 'good ol'Kandee is back!' The one from years ago! :)
Please do a Halloween makeup tutorial on Endora from Bewitched!!
STOPPED THE VIDEO I WAS WATCHING TO WATCH THIS, THUMBNAIL IS AWESOME. LOVE YOU!❤
Whew! You’re so talented!!

Love the look, but the editing in this video made it hard to watch.  Too many jumpcuts and flashes.  Gave me a headache about halfway through
This video made me so inspired to do some real fancy makeup for halloween<33 Unfortunately, i am not so talented as you, so I am probably going to end up looking like a idiot this year too.
WOW 😲This is way cool. I absolutely love your creativity and love ❤️ love 💕 love 💗 your videos!!  Have a perfectly wonderful day 😘

"We never know when I'm gonna upload. It's just like a surprise" 😂
Kandee, you are so skilled. Just your eyeliner ability and color blending alone make me shake my head in wonderment, nevermind everything else! It's like watching my mom do something so expertly  and I'm standing there thinking, "Wow she's a magician!" You're a magician Kandee, and a wonderful influential force. I'm so grateful for you! 😄😘😘
I LOVE the way you edited it and how the final look came together! I've always wanted to go to a masquerade party!
Such a fun look and the editing was awesome! Really different, I enjoyed it!

This is amazing Kandee! You’re so talented and creative. Love the makeup and the video edit and you’re such a sweetheart xx
Looks super cute but reminds me more of poison ivy 🤷‍♀️.
I love this Kandee! It gave me so much inspiration! 😍😊💕
This was cool, but REALLY hard to watch...I would have preferred it not be so over edited
I really love this video! And the edits and everything Kandee! Good job!! Love you! 😘😘😘😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love the texture in this look! Now  girl - I gotta know - who edited this video?
Amazing look, next time can you not have all the fancy camera work. It fits w the theme but made me so dizzy and it was difficult to watch and enjoy your art making. Thanks.
Kandee I miss your videos. Loved this.
The way you used the tattoo stickers was amazing! This looks beautiful!
Hi Kandee!!! You are amazing and I love the look!!!!   The look should be called mistress of the night....er the wee hours of the morning 😉❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is soooo fun!! I love this!! You are brilliant and beautiful!
😍 It's been awhile, great video
Gorgeous girl! I couldn't even imagine doing this...nevermind at 5:15 in the morning!  You are the best! ♥ Elle
You look like Lady Gaga
Those lips!! DSL for sure.
Love the look just wish you didn't go so fast showing it on video.
Absolutely love this look!!!!
Yeah I clicked the bell and have my notifications on and this didn’t show up in my feed or notify me when it was uploaded. I had to search to your channel to find it
Beautiful darling!!!! Would you like to do a collab with me sometime?
Oh my gosh, this may be my most favorite costume look you have ever done- it’s beautiful, mysterious, and just absolutely STUNNING!!! I may have to try this because I am in love with this look! 😍😍😍 Thanks for taking the time to do the look, film it, edit it, and post it for us- you are absolutely amazing and I’m sending you huge hugs from my house to you! 😘 I love you so much, Kandee!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Stunning!! I was mesmerized watching this!!🖤
This was so cute 😍😍
That's really pretty!  So happy to see you back! Hope to see many more videos from you soon! (((Hugs!)))
What a great idea! Came out spectacular 😍👍 when I was young,I collected these ceramic style masks,now my daughter has them,this is definitely a contender for Halloween!! TFS ♥️
It’s hurts my soul when I don’t get notifications that there’s new content . I hope YouTube resolves this issue quickly. Love you 🍬
I'm subscribed and have the "bell" clicked but never get notifications :(
Amazing. The look is totally inspiring!!  The editing was fantastic.  Please don’t think you have to do fancy editing for all your videos. You need your sleep.  Even a chit chat get ready with me video would be delightful.
The editing is so good but made it a bit hard to focua >.< sorry ily
You look amazing, great job Kandee,love watching your videos.
It shows I'm still subscribed but I didnt get the notification.
Hi Kandee! Amazing video! Youtube shows that I am still subscribed to your channel. I have the bell rung for alert always, but I have not been notified of your video uploads from youtube in months. I usually only know you uploaded because of snapchat.
Love these looks and your tutorials!!!
I like the editing Kandee! Great job
So pretty! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Looks amazing!!!
I love this!! You're so talented! 💕🤗
You should  do sally from nightmare before Christmas
Seen your post on Snapchat! Yes, I was not subscribed (noticed this last week) re-subscribe ...but didn’t get notified when this went up. Hope they fix it!
Aww, Kandee! I love this!
I once watched you when I was 6 and I loved your lip tattoo videos :D
After that, I never really watched you again...
BUT. I'm 16 now, and I saw this add bout lipstick tattoos and it just clicked in my mind and thought about your video from so many years ago. To see you with so many famous people, doing so many cool things and your makeup tutorials becoming amazing like this one - it really warms my heart to see you come such a long way!
I'm really proud of you and I'm sure your millions of other subscribers agree with me!
Love this!!
Kandee you should do a custom month
Wow Kandee. This is incredible, so stunning. 😍
The editing for this was cool, but totally unhelpful from a tutorial aspect. The fast cutaways and fuzzy effects made it impossible to tell what you were doing, even though you had described it as more of a “visual” tutorial in the beginning. Creativity is a 10, education was a 1.
Ooh I love the face tattoos and pearl brows. You are bloody beautiful dear!
Yay I asked for the  masquerade and I love it
Love this look you are creatively talented. I would maybe call this look 
bellamente enmascarado.
Beautiful look!! You are so talented! 💕
I like this look! It was a bit fast, and I was wondering why you didn’t draw on the tattoos yourself, but overall, cool Halloween look!
I was unsubscribed from every beauty related channel I had subscribed to. I noticed this Monday.
Wow the editing on this is amazing!!
Love! I love the edits. It's a quick video but if someone is using as a reference there is a pause button. So happy to see your face and makeup being used! Lol!
You’re so talented and inspiring! Proud that you’re half Mexicana ;D
I thought this was a jeffree star look
Stunning look! I really like your take on a masquerade look. 💜
This look is amazing!!!  I had to come search for this video though, if didn’t show up, YouTube is so frustrating sometimes.
I love this look! It's so elegant, mysterious and pretty!
HOLY GUACAMOLE! KANDEE!! I LOVE THIS! The editing was awesome! I can’t wait to see more Halloween videos, and other videos too!
Omg I haven't watched your videos in so long! I used to be so obsessed with your channel like 4 years ago, you were the first beauty guru I ever watched! I forgot how beautiful you were how much I liked your videos
Wow Kandee this must have taken so long! How gorgeous ! ❤️💜💜
This is amazing! How long did it take for you to do this?
I’ve missed your videos 😭
This is stunning!!!!
Im a small youtuber and I always spread inspiration and pick others up. After being denied and belittled by "big" youtubers. I made it my goal to help everyone no matter how low a sub count. Talent shouldn't be measure on subscriber or view numbers. So I feature looks I love in every video giving everyone I can more exposure to share their love of makeup and works of art. I want to reach out to more people so i can help everyone. I want to reach 100k to really make an impact and truly help small youtubers. It's my time to make a difference. ♡
I'm so obsessed with the way you edited this wow
Where did you buy the rose tattoos.  Face lace products are awesome. Great tutorial thanks
So, I looked it up...there's not a word for how cool this is. Congratulations, you've exceeded all levels of awesome!
this was amazing - thanks for staying up late to do it!
No I never got the notifications for this video and I’m a subscriber
😍😍😍 wow i love this look
Amazing kandee!!!!!!
Wow!!!! I adore you Kandee! I love your sweet heart and am so happy to see some videos from you!!!❌⭕️
BEAUTIFUL. ... sugar skull look
Yes!! 💕💕💕
Love your gorgeous and amazing videos!!!!
I loved this tutorial
Can we just take a sec to notice how much Kandee has changed since 2009?! Also who else has been here since the start?!
whoa!!! That’s so awesome! Kandee you are so flipping talented, it just blows my little mind!!!!💕💕
The edit on this video 😍😍😍😍😍🙌🏼👏🏼
No notifications 😞
5:15!am!!? did you go to bed late or wake up super early!
Welcome back Kandee! I’ve missed you a lot! 😘 Love the look! But how do you remove those tattoos from your face afterwards?
I MISS THE COSTUME LOOKS SOOOO MUCH! Who remembers the Edward Scissorhands look? Everything. Just everything. ❤️
I would rather of seen a green wig... it definitely gave me poison ivy vibes... love love love you!!!!
I love you Kandeeeeeeee so I have deep set eyes and it is soooooooooooooooooo hard to find nice colorful eye makeup looks (I have trouble with the crease part) so I b-e-g you please make a tutorial just for THIS eye look from this vid. Thank you girly!
This is beautifully edited 🤤
Love this!!!!!
YOU ARE AMAZING AT DOING MAKEUP 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Remember when she did videos we could follow and weren’t cut into adhd flashes of edits?  It’s a beautiful look but I have no idea what you put on your eyes.
This looks beautiful and so detailed . But you doing it  made me think I could too. But I am not going anywhere!
LOVE LOOK. NOT A Fan of New editing.
The editing on your video is really cool,  you are so creative!
you always make me smile love ya
I absolutely love this! ❤️❤️❤️
So pretty!!  I love it!! 🥰❤️👍🏻😻
THIS IS SO FREAKIN AMAZINGGGGGG
Wish I could have seen more of what your were doing but awesome look!
This is such an awesome look!! I love those eye lace pieces-- they look so cool!
Beautiful 😍 ❤
Gorgeous as always Kandee
Love this ! 😍💜
This look is one of my favorites!!  Love the hair color  too!
🌈 KANDEE!!! How long did this take? 🌟That is amazing! YOU are amazing!!! 💜
Impossible for me to watch, all over the freaking place.
MAQUILLAJE DE LABIOS TUTORIAL
The look could be named The Rose-Grower‘s daughter
Who else thought it was Carli Bybel in the pic?
Where did you get the wig from ? 😩
Yes girl!
Love the look!! Music ?
Yay finally! This video was such a pain for you to get up! I’m glad it finally worked! Love love love the look! How long were you going to hide your secret that your a bad ass tattoo artist too?! Xoxo 💋
Some Halloween Kandee! Haha!! I amuse myself 😁
Perfection again!!
I LOVE this look!!! 🤗❤️
Looks very pretty.  😍💓  I love the roses in your hair.  😍💓
Looks so gorgeous!! Nice 💜
What's a holiday without Kandee?!  I love temp tattoos!
This might be one of your most intricate looks!
AMAZING ❣❣❣
Wow! I love it!! So amazing!! 💗
Loved this 😍😍
Love the eye pieces
Love it!!!! <3
My cat farted?
Beautiful as always
Best look ever!
Kandee keep up the great work
I absolutely love that this look is so intricate but is also doable for someone who is not a makeup artist with using the tattoos/lace stickers. What a fantastic idea and I love how you colored in the roses! So pretty!
I 💙💙 Kandee, but i didnt like the editing
Kandeeeee <3  You are awesome
Great work girly have a bless day
You’re so gorgeous as always! With this awesome Halloween look too. Love you Kandee! ❤️
The editing is bomb on this omg! Wow
You think you deserve a party while certain girls suffer.
You’re too cute I love you!
Please so more fillers Kandee 😣 you don't need it your Gorgeous!!
Love it omg!!
The most beautiful-est and most creative on YOUTUBE!!!!
Kandee you look AMAZING & I’m going to try doing this for my Mardi Gras Day look, I’m going as Zoe Redbird from the House of Night series & she’s got intricate flowery tattoos on her body so seeing what you did I know now exactly what I want cause this sparked something in my head so thank you Kandee!!
That is so beautiful. You rock.
I love ya girl, but the duck lips no! You don't need to pucker your GORGEOUS lips!
This was one of two videos I have seen updated in God knows how long. The last one was ur life update and before that...God knows when. Xx
Kandee amazing look
Temporary tattoos applied OVER foundation? I never knew that was possible especially since directions usually state to make sure skin is clean and oil free. I'm definitely going to try this - thanks to you!. Love the masquerade look and thinking it could so easily segue into a "sugar skull" look. With your skills I just know you could pull that off quite easily <3
YAY ILY
Per SNAP request: have been subscribed for yearsssss and I haven’t received a notification of a new video in a looooooong time. Yes, the notification bell is turned on for ALL new videos. I hope YouTube can help fix this, Kandee. I bet it’s frustrating to spend so much time on content only for subscribers to not receive notifications ✌🏼💕 sending love and peace!
I was unsubcribed. I just resubscribed. Hopefully they get this worked out. I love watching your videos
You are seriously so beautiful Kandee!! 😍😍
Oh well. Do it anyway. Human trash can.
LOVE IT KANDEE! 💗
I like the video
Scum. Keep scumming for attention.
Love you!!! Ijust started my own channel on braids and hairstyles and would apprecaite any support🙏
Wow!  Love how you filled in the tattoos with eyeshadow and lip gloss!  I would much rather have seen more detail in how you applied the eye makeup, even if it meant a lengthy video.
It's a gorgeous look,  Maybe a Punny Name,  like :   Rose from the grave..  Or "A Kiss From A Rose"   Like the song from Seal >>
Didn't like the edit. can't really focus with all this fast shots ! come on Kadnee!!!
Omg i love this video it is stunning! Kandee please tell us how long it took to complete? Colouring in those beautiful roses would have been ages!
Love this!!! It’s like a modern Alice in Wonderland...Rose from the flower garden come to life!!!
Wowowow  suck an amazing idea
I just get so excited when you post a YouTube video!!!
Love your costume looks! Your Snow White and Chola were some of the first I ever watched on YouTube. I missed you talking to us as you did all the application.
I llooove this look , and I love a Kandee video day ❤️❤️❤️
Love you Kandee!!! I love your heart it’s pure of gold!! And your make up 😊
Kandee, you're like an evil-mad-genius-creative creature. How on earth do you think of things like these?!
This is amazing! I wish that a) I was even half talented enough to pull this off and b) I had exciting Halloween plans to wear this to! Also, I love the style and editing of this video!
Stunning
TALENT
I would call the look Mystical Wow!  Love to you always, Kandee.
Love it!! Killed it as usually, Kandee! These looks look so complicated but you find ways to make it so easy for anyone to try. Can’t wait to see what else you come up with next!
Rose queen
Nice look kandy love it
Love love love and it's not another sugar skull it so cool and diffrent
Kandee I just saw ur snap on baby Cora and I'm so thankful for people using their fame to help greater causes... human trafficking is a huge problem and cause close to my heart... I am a mommy of 2 small kids and cant imagine what kind of human being  tried to do what her mom did... I didnt watch the videos nor do I want to... love u Kandee... I've been watching you for so many years now and your heart is what keeps me coming back. Hope to meet you one day and give u a hug and high five.
Love this Halloween look!!! You look gorgeous, watching your videos is like a breath of fresh air thanks kandee!!!
gorgeous as always. and i love how you can totally break down the look and use bits or do the whole thing together. <3 . . . wonder if I can get away with having pearl eyebrows at work . . .:3
I wasnt notified but i saw it in my feed. Later that day. Cool look kandee!!😁
Love it!  Stunning!  BeeeaaauuTIful
Yaaas
I love Halloween and I love you ❤️💕
absolutely in love! this is so creative i love it
My fav part of the video is how short it is! Sometimes I feel like beauty vloggers draaaaaaag out their videos soooo long. I have 2 young kids & normally cant sit to watch a 15-25 min video. Thanks for something I can watch in between interruptions!
Very beautiful idea. You even had the nails done to continue the theme. Very nice,  thoughout.
I thought you were Christian 😑
OMG y lo VE thai tutorial
Wow you are really good and a inspiration to all the makeup geeks out there...
Love this. ❤️❤️❤️
Sooo cute, I love your videos so much.
Absolutely beautiful!!!!! Might try the tattoos for Halloween!
Look was amazing but the camera made me sooo dizzy!
Liked the look, unfortunately not use to the editing. Found it difficult to focus for myself personally (i hope that isnt taken the wrong way). I do think i may try this look out with body paints or something similar lol.
You’re a goddess
Another fabulous video from the awesome Kandee!
Loved the look ...🌹🌹🌹
Amazing look Kandee 😍😍😍❤️❤️💖💓

Super cool look! Wish I had a Halloween party to go to and try a version of this. Loved the new “look” the video too. Wish it was a little longer for more detailed information. I stay wondering how you removed all the black paint from your neck and chest though! Beautiful
We love you still Kandee
Hate the editing. Way too jump aroundy. Not fun to watch and too fast to learn anything from.
WOW!!!!!!
Kandee I love you so much. We have been friends for nine years. But you may not know about it lol. Love your surprise videos ❤️⚓️

You’re such an artist!! Fun video to watch even with if you aren’t going to recreate! Well done, Kandee!!
What is going on? What's up with the neck painting? Is she loosing her spark? She is to advance for this..
Where could I rock this look after Halloween without people looking at me??? I love this look and would totally rock it!! 😭😭😭
I love it❤❤❤
YASS KANDEE! BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE CREATIVITY
Sandra Lindahl 😍
That's the Kandee I know making costume tutorials. I love it!! Big hug Kandee.
Beautiful!!!!!
I love love it
Love it 😊
Looks gorg!
💕💕
WOW
Hi

Did you get your lips done or is it trickery of the makeup?
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
So close to 4 million u go girl 🎉🎉🎉 love this look!!! 😍
Kandee Skull! 💀
Love it !! But how do you NOT get flecks of eyeshadow all over your face when doing your eyes... when I use bright colors. They go EVERYWHERE!!!
Great look. Video made me very dizzy.
Looooove this!
Amazing 😉
omggg ur stanning
Love this look
Kween! 👸
Wow!
Whaaaaaaaaatttt?? The OG Halloween Kandee is back! This is the reason I started following you back in the day. This look is fantastic! A true artist!
❤️ cuty
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
Love this Halloween look! Very creative and beautiful.
Oh how I miss your Halloween videos 😩
Did Kandee get her lips filled??
Why don’t I get notifications anymore when new videos post? Anyone else do that.
New Orleans halloween look 🌷🌹🌸🌚
I am NEVER notified of your new videos.  the only way i know is from your snapchat, what the actual heck!?!?!  grrr >:( GIVE ME MY KANDEE BACK YOUTUBE!!
Like #298 u are nothing but TALENT 🎃💗🎃💗🎃💗🎃 amazing ! Inspiring chica !!
Я одна русская здесь?😕
U look gorggg
Wtf?
🍫🍭🍬Kandee J!🍬🍭🍫 I love your skills. Big question: what do you think of K-beauty and the idea of using herbal masks and other natural goodies? There are so many amazing, adorable products that would be fun to see you demonstrate (like masks or tri-color lipsticks). The Face Shop and Etude House = 🤩. Hugs from Canada zooming at ya! 😘
Just watched a video of yours from 6 years ago... And girl how have you literally turned back the hands of time?? And your lips are SO much bigger what did you use???
Does anybody know the name of this song

Bella!
Kandee!!! Kween!!!!
this look seemed a little rushed and not as nice to , almost a little lazy like. :/ i know you have potential for so much more and i hope to see much better halloween looks soon 😊
You are sooo good at makeup! Im going to do a masquerade makeup video for beginners on my channel! lol that should be a hoot!
Love it
Can we get a video about your lip fillers? Who is your doctor? Pain? Price? How many cc’s you have?
What have you done to your lips?? They look so good. Are they filled? I want to do mine but don't want them to look fake :/
AHH!! new Kandee Halloween tutorials!  <3
It’s not Halloween if it’s día de los muertos ??? That’s 2 different holiday.....
Love
OMG KANDEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! I love this video! ur talented always blows my mind. love u!
YOU GUYS.  Why with the rude comments? Why with the, "The world revolves around me, so I'm going to tell you what you SHOULD do, next time" (but then saying you "love her") comments...?!?!  It's baffling to me.  1 - Kandee is the nicest person on the planet, why don't you learn from her & say ONLY positive and uplifting things?!   2 - She obviously was trying something different & the editing went with the vibe of the costume: Edgy, creative, different.   3- The world doesn't revolve around you, so why not just be appreciative of the fact that Youtube is FREE and we get to watch someone's TIME AND EFFORT in action, not for a price... but... FOR FREE.   Therefore, BE HAPPY.        
Love it Kandee!
Cool it on the lip injections
Pretty makeup, altho I would have liked it more if it wasn't a costume of someone else's culture. Although I don't think it looks that much like Día de Muertos. You could have just left off the name of their religious holiday to celebrate their ancestors.
Fun
OMG, Kandee! The editing on this video is AMAZING 😱🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 and the look is so cool, I want to do this right now😍
I really liked the editing of this video! I think it was cool that you did something different and were so creative with the editing, if pep want to I think they can totally still follow it which is awesome but you pushed the envelope! Way to go girl XOXOXO 💜💙💚💛💖
Thank you for not advertising it as a "mexican sugar skull". You did a beautiful job, and I can see the inspiration but yet is very "yours" and unique. I think a lot of people don't realize the importance of understanding the difference between inspiration and appropriation :(. This looks amazing, Kandee ❤️
Don't get me wrong.. I absolutely love this look and you!! BUT, I really wish you hadn't done so much unnecessary editing and effects 😕 It really took away from the video and there was no explanation of what you did at all. Ya, most is self explanatory and easy to switch up and it wasn't a tutorial, it just would have been nice to hear you talk about a few things.
Love how u edited it it’s amazing and so r u
It was so cool meeting you, Kandee! Also I've received quite a few compliments on my brow game lol so thanks for that
That was awesome!! You should do Halloween face painting on kids next time.. the kids would love you!
Where are you sending hugs back from?!?
Kandee is everyone in your family like, ridiculously good looking?
the snake guys little happy kick while hugging Kandee after getting his eyebrows done lmao
Oh Kandee, facing fears and fleeking brows. :o) I was so jazzed every time someone said yes.
And you were scared of doing BROWS... next thing you know a freaking SNAKE is wrapped around your neck! Holy crap, Kandee! Good for you! 🤗
Dear God, that was one of the best, funniest vids I’ve ever seen. I laughed so hard I couldn’t breathe!! Do them again!!
YES YES YES Please make more street makeovers! How fun!
Oh my, your cousin Josh is so cute.
You know what the most amazing thing is? Is that Kandee is actually this nice in person and you can legit feel the goodness of her soul and heart when u meet her. Truly one of the most AMAZING AND KINDEST, warmest, good hearted people I have EVER had the honor of meeting in my entire life. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ she was the reason why I started Youtube and honestly has just never disappointed, she’s just a good person through and through ❤️❤️
You should do it again, bc you conquered a lot of your fears talking to people doing, strangers eyebrows, LOL and the freaking snake around your neck 🤣😂
Pretty sure any guy would let you do whatever you want to his face. Haha
this by far the funniest thing ive seen on youtube in along time.
Haha her cousin already had perfect eyebrows
I loved this!!! Your energy alone makes the video but doing this on guys was genius!!!
Little do these guys know that girls would die to have you do their brows Kandee!! lol!  Love you girl! ♥ Elle
They just started flocking to you! Good brows are no joke
I love Daniel Thrasher lol!! I can’t believe he found you 😂
I know you get that a lot, but you ARE the nicest person on earth! Love from Quebec, Canada 🇨🇦. 😘😘😘
Kandee is so beautiful!!!

Hugs from Texas  Kandee  ..
You are pure JOY!  I like the street makeovers.  You were a blessing to all you met. (By the way, those signs with the googly-eyes, ADORABLE!!).  Maybe the next street makeover could be, "Let me give you a new lip color", 'cause we've all encountered someone wearing a color that didn't serve them well.  When you're next in NYC, Times Square would be fun.  Thank you for brightening my day!
This video was a brilliant idea! Would love to see more 👌🏽♥️
Also YES DO THIS AGAIN haha. Looooooove.
This was SO fun, refreshing, and genuine! I love you Kandee, you can do no wrong <3
Kandee!! Yess you absolutely have to try this again! So so much fun for the viewer to watch. 
I also love that you chose to do a challenge involving men. As a guy, who recently fell in love with makeup, I LOVED this whole idea. 😍👌🏻 
Makeup is for everyone! It’s inclusive not exclusive. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this too 💕  When I watch your content I always feel uplifted, inspired, and that anything is possible. If you say you can you can! 

Love from NYC!

Tyler

Best video ever!!! Do it again Kandee, I love you!
Yes do more like this. You have the best heart and soul and do things for people. I think it’s amazing all the people that come up to you. Your joy for life is a magnet to people. Who doesn’t want to be around someone like you. I’ve been watching you for years and am crazy about you. My dad died this year and turned my world upside down. I’m struggling so bad and I rewatched a couple of your videos from when your father died, hoping to pick up on some of the positivity from you and the way you honored your father by continuing to live your life. I just can’t get there. You are a strong woman with your God given gift of being able to look at the positive always. Me, I just want my dad bacon so bad. 😞
Loved this video! And the editing was awesome too! ❤ from Australia
Yes yes and YESSS!!!! Love you Kandee, your energy is amazing.
Josh is adorable!! And definitely HIT THE STREETS as a series. Its so much fun to watch. Love you Kandee. Hugs from 🌞 Florida
Hey kandee !!! This video was so great , please make more. It was so exciting to see all the brow transformations.
So amazing that you actually did this! The idea of putting yourself out there on the street that way must have been so terrifying and to see it turned out so fun and rewarding. 

This is actually a great anxiety example about how things are usually never as bad as we feel, and things usually turn out okay in the end. 

Remember how nervous you were in the beginning, now that you are done, would you say you regret it or was it worth it? 

Every time we are nervous we should remember to ask if we think it will be worth it and accept we feel nervous but do it anyway :) 

So even though this was a video about eyebrows, it was also a very inspiring thing you did. And the snake, can we talk about how brave you were about facing that fear for a sec, just WOW! 

So thank you for being you, the inspiration, smiling person on the street <3
OMG!!  YES...this was the best video I have seen a long time!  Josh is totes adorbs, btw.  Love you, Kandee!  I would love to run into you on day.  Will be kinda hard since I am in TX, but maybe one day. ;o)  Oh, and keep Josh in these videos!
I love how bubbly Kandee is! She's amazing

Dang Kandee! Your cousin is fine.
After watching you I think eyebrows are even more important for men then women,
I loved it , your so funny , my respect with the snake think . I dont think I would had even thouch that snake , I am terrified of the snakes .
Love you Kandee this was so cool!!
I feel like the Jedi master would look way better without the mustache lol
Hilarious!!!!!
Free Halloween Makeup would be awesome!  This was fun but for the snake I had to fast forward past it ewwwww!!!
So proud of you for facing your fears with that snake. Wish I was there I barely have eyebrows.
Guys definitely need their brows done too!! I just want to say, that whole snake thing, I kept thinking, “Get that thing off of her!” It was making me panic just watching!!
Ok I’ve watched this now multiple times, kandee you always bring a smile to my face even during times that are tough. I love you snake reaction, I don’t think I could’ve let him put that snake on me. Also I’m totally here for your cousin 🙋🏼‍♀️ lol he’s adorable, tell him to dm me lol @mandalynn3389
9:26 Cute how U stuck your tongue owt.  R U scared of snakes, Kandee?
Love, love, love that you went out on the street and were able to get guys to let you give them 'guy brows'.
Next video womens never used makeup transformations in the street.. Love it 💄💕❤️📹🇵🇷
She’s an angel. I love Kandee.
This video brought me so much happiness thank you so much kandee you are such a amazing person your personality shines through the video !!
This was so much fun!!! I thought that lady from New Zealand who was joking about hunting her whole life for her son was hilarious, I was cracking up. Man, people are so wonderful and weird and in a video like this you see strangers coming together and being the way humans are supposed to be. Loved it and love you, Kandee! ♥️
Loved this video!! Please make more videos like this one!!
When did you go bonde???I dont remember!
Please hit the streets again Kandee! I loved this!
How to hold a snake in your arms tutorial
You did amazing Kandee!!! I don’t like snakes either.....boo no
Clearly people had no clue that a goddess of makeup was willing to do your eyebrows for free!!! I would be seriously fan girling!!! It actually blows my mind that people weren’t running to you!!!
Kandee is so cute! So glad to see a new video! Missed you Kandee!
KANDEE’S LAUGH AT 1:29!!! 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Eyebrow interventions is like my dream reality show- it’s like a tick & 3 times I’ve worked up the strength to be like sista let me help you.
Oh Kandee, I would just die if I had that snake around me. Yikes!!! Great 👍🏼 video. Do it again....Sending love, hugs. 💕👍🏼🙏🏼🤗 and kindness. 👍🏼💕🙏🏼💕
Great video, super fun. Would love to see more videos like this. Also your cousin is so cute.

❤❤❤
Kandee you’re so brave doing this! I’m so glad you didn’t chicken out. Hollywood seems so fun!
We want more!!!
I bet all guys would let Kandee do it...because she's so beautiful inside and out...
I never wanted to get my eyebrows ✅ until I saw this video...If I ever meet Kandee I would ask her to do them. I doubt that dream would ever happen since, I live in Oregon. 😔
😍😍😍😍😍
What Kandee poor snake it wanted a brow make over too.
KANDEE CHEEKBONES AND MAKEUP ARE STUNNING,,,,
I love the video Kandee Johnson!! 💖💖 I think you should do another video like this again ☺️☺️ I wish you did my eyebrows 😁😁
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Haha this was a great video! It’s awesome that some of these guys came up and wanted their eyebrows done, and they looked good afterward! 😍 Can you come do mine? 😉 I’m also proud of you for holding that snake- I’ve held snakes like that before, and it’s intimidating but also kind of thrilling (in a good way)! It would definitely be fun to see another video like this- it actually reminds me of the video you did where you went out on the streets and gave those girls makeovers. 😀 Thanks for your positivity and your sweetness, Kandee- I love and admire you so much!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Thought you said “my husband Josh” then you said “he’s single” I think I’m tired
Kandee your the positive influence this world needs right now! You spread love like crazy it’s amazing ❤️
Oh wow! 😲 I wonder how awesome my husband's brows would turn out?
Kandee, you are such a positive, kind force. I’ve been watching you for 10 years it seems by now and you’re just always so consistent in your content. I know you may feel uninspired by the craziness that is the internet but I hope you are proud of yourself and how far you’ve truly come. You are so versatile and completely awesome at each thing you do. Be it decorating, crafting, tutorials, baking (the pumpkin cheesecake video with your Dad is still my favorite and I made that pie for everyone over the years) on the whim makeovers, you’re just always yourself and I think that’s what makes you the most enjoyable person to watch. Have all the fun you can and thank you for being a light, especially when I feel my own light dimming. It’s nice to see some brightness from you whenever you have a new video. Xo.
Omg like all these men looked really good with their eyebrows groomed and filled in. Wtf?? If only they would take their time to calm the bush down on them! There are men eyebrow products .... buy them!!  Also great job Kandee on playing along with the snake. You did t ran away and kept going. You are a bad ass for free eyebrows make overs!!
I was wondering when she’d have a new video up. Those eyebrows look good.
Fun,fun,fun!! I don't care for snakes either Kandee, ,hell no, ,tfs♡♡
You meet all kinds of people there volunteering your eyebrow services!!  Very entertaining!!  I’d like to see something elsewhere maybe with an easy trend for women!! 🤩💄💋❤️
hands down one of my favorite youtube videos ever, this was so entertaining and you are so funny!
Thought you were quitting you tube?
Such a fun video!!! ♥️💕
You did great 👍🏼
Yes!!! Do it again!!! 😁😂
Where is her anatomic heart phone case from!?!?
Omg that snake 😫 girl you've got some balls to do that. Lol I hate snakes too. This was such a fun video. I wish my man could run into you walking down the street cuz he has some super hairy brows. Lol 🤗🤗❤❤ l
I thought you said husband, not cousin. I freaked out like when did you get married?
Yesss do it again at least one more time this was awesome Kandee!
What an awesome idea for a video!! Kandee how did you hold it together when the snake was on you??  I would have completely lost it!!
This is so cool!! But i think the front of the eyebrows are to dark no hate ly!
Your cousin is so cute!!
BTY your cous is cute!
The filling in is Terribleeee😂😂
Josh is so hot!
Love it!!!!!!!
We love a hot cousin lolololol
Awesome video Kandee!! would love to get a eyebrow makeover from you lol ❤️✨❤️
Did anyone else think she said husband instead of cousin?
This is such an adorable video!
Love you so so so much kandee 💖💖💖
So much FUN!!  Love it!  Def hit the streets for more!!  💕
Awesome video kandee! That snake was wild!!!!
Second!
YESSS OMG DO THIS MORE OFTEN SOOOOO GOOOOD AND ORIGINAL!!!!
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ur cuz is hot!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍

So cool , i loved the idea ❤️
I loved this
Loved this video, so fun!
Love this
That was awesome!
You are the cutest Kandee!!!!
We want more!
Good job
😂😂😂😂
Kandee holding a snake = how I will be if I ever hold a snake... which will be never! X
💖❤️🧡🤣💛💚💙💜
💖💖💖
OMG!!!! You did it ;) LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU
Bringing back the cool videos!
Yea!!!! This was fun!!! Yea Kandee!!!!💖😊😊😊
Well the gloves are not just for 'don't know what face I'd be touching' but more for the faces being touch by hands that were in unknown places gathering all the nasty microbs. It sounded a litle selfish, altough I believe you did not mean to.  In my opinion the man with the snake should have bigger, stronger eyebrows done to match him. HE was very kind. The deamon was very kind and nice too! And Josh? I would date him! He seems open, energetic, nice and good looking too! :P
Yes do it again
This was great
So freaking cool Kandee!
4:32 that’s poudii dad lol
yaaasss Kandee hit the streets again !!!
Fun yes do more please!
You are too cute Kandee! I loved every second!
Great video Kandee😘💋
Omg andrew so hot!!!
Hit the streets Kandee
Josh is such a snack!! What a cutie!
This is so funny
Great job kandee
lol she's so nice
Hit the Street! !!!!!!!!!
This is sooo fun!!!!
I know who I’m hitting up for my vidcon brows ❤️
Awesome video
So fun!! What a great video! 💖💖💖
So cute!
Just curious, is this fun video sponsored Kandee?
Awesome
So fun!!!! Pittsburgh PA
Kandee, you’re awesome at what you do but I think guys with over-groomed eyebrows look weird.
So much fun!!
Such a fun video! Well done Kandee! 😁
This was a fun video Kandee!
Kandee!! This was so fun!! Great idea!! 👍💜👌
love it!
Love love love this video!!
Yes!!! Again!!!
This was so much FUN to watch!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kandee's charisma is amazing. The way she interact with people and make any contact such a fun experience. I remember since the beginning of her videos, because I follow her since the beginning, it was when she was looking for a tutu and went to different stores, she plays and dances with a guy while she tries on tutus and belts. So fun video. Nobody gets bored with her.
Do this again!
Your cousin Josh is so handsome!  And all the guys looked so much better after you did their eyebrows!  Now I wonder how many of the girlfriends are going to want to do their boyfriends brows!
Kandee,  for the next video,  can you please do a makeup tutorial of meg from Disney's Hercules?
10:44 that was a good one
💖💖💖
Hmmmmm I have not seen you in a while. At first, I thought holy cow your face is stuffed with fillers!  But as I watch, it looks like you’ve had more done and I’m curious if it is after-surgery swelling?  I’m not judging, I just hope you are ok. You don’t really look like you so I hope you haven’t had to deal with infection or anything. This was a fun video Kandee. Big hugs from Calgary, Canada 🇨🇦
Thumbs up to Kandee for holding that snake!!
Yes
❤️❤️❤️
To smile? Lol
Lol Oh wow! 😲
❤️❤️
Adoring this new video style Kandee! 💖 It gave me Buzzfeed vibes. 💁🏼‍♀️
Amazing video !
Such a fun video!
I posted my first YouTube video and it’s a makeup tutorial can y’all please check it out it’s only 3 min
OMG Kandee I couldn’t watch the snake part, sorry. 😳😳😳 But the rest was so funny. Great video. Miss seeing your videos. Hopefully we will get to see Halloween tutorials soon Please.

Kandee! This is such a cute idea!
Kandee!!! I miss these crazy videos!!! 💜💜💜
Super fun video!!
She's back:)
Halloween makeovers on the street!
5:46 horrible
Thought you quit youtube?
So cute, Kandee!!!
It would be a good idea to wear a bikini or dress sexier to attract attention to yourself. Your are beautiful and it would be easier. You might even make a few bucks of it. It's just a suggestion.
How fun Kandee!
Hellooooooo Kandee’s cousin!
I love this! I need you to do my husband’s brows asap lol. He would not let me do them for nothing. Lol
Ridiculous
guys should NEVER touch their hair - they look perfect the way they are! we could say the same for females. but espesh for males.

You and your mom are so cute! You can see where you got your sweet loving personality! Your mom is just adorable!!!
Hi Kandee,
After years of debating about posting a message, I finally became brave enough to send you a little note to say thank you.  Perhaps it was your previous video that encouraged me, but I wanted you to know how inspiring you have been to me.  I've had many dark days of never feeling good enough and lesser than, but you have always shown such kindness and bravery in all of your videos - they gave me hope.  My grandma used to say to me "pretty is as pretty does", and I truly believe you have one of the kindest, prettiest hearts I have ever seen.  Your videos kept me going and kept me believing there was some beauty in the world (specifically humanity); your kindness to others has always made me want to be a better person.  Although I feel as if I really have no right to be saying this, I wanted you to know I am so thankful for all of the smiles you have brought / given to others, myself included.  I was able to find a little bit of courage and confidence through your videos, enough so that when recently approached about making a little video of my story, I said yes as I hoped others could find a little bit of strength through my story.  
Thank you again - as I said before your kindness and humility keeps me wanting to be a better person. 
I am thankful there are people like you in the world.
(I am not a pusher of my single dinky video - but here is the link to it.  I guess I'm hoping you'll see how you have motivated me to share my story and help others feel as if they are never alone...    )

P.S. Your Sinful nail polish is my favorite!  My nails don't look even a smidgen close to how nice yours are, but I am wearing it here 😊
Wish I had my own mommy back🌸
Loved this video! I always love seeing Ms. Shannon! Y'all are the kindest and the most gorgeous! -xo
I absolutely love ur mommy and i follow her Instagram.

Lol!! You look identical 😻 you guys are the sweetest ever!! Big thumbs up!!
Before contouring became a tremd that actually was where bronzer was supposed to go...and on your cheeks. You were supposed to look sunkissed. I still do that today :-) love your mom! More videos together please ❤
She is beautiful and so sweet!
You can’t apply eye makeup and wear your glasses at the same time, Kandee! Stop making me feel bad. I carry a suction cup mirror when I travel because my full sized magnifying mirror won’t fit in my makeup case, thank you very much. 😜
(Don’t you send boxes of makeup to your sweetest Mom? I hope so XO)
Her mom looks like a more stunning and classic version of Roseanne before she went nuts .
God bless your mom. She's so beautiful and has such a wonderful positive personality. I wish I could be like that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaB3fbQ_yN8
 
 (your mom already seems to have a few tricks so maybe she could teach your subscribers (and their moms) more :D)
Thank you so much for the fun video <3 Always great seeing a video from you, just remember to get some sleep, we would rather you post the video 1-2 days later and be rested than working the whole night and getting a few minutes/hours of sleep!!
 Love from Iceland <3 <3

I love your contagious happiness and I'm lucky you share that with the world.

I am a lot like her momma 😅 except my makeup is not usually the fancy/spendy brands lol i watch the tutorials more out of curiosity and for fun. I am not good at modern make-up 😂
There's friends waiting for you every where you go! Love that!

Two very sweet ladys 😘
TWINS 💕
Two beautiful women inside and out 😊

Your mom should do a channel for the 50+ crowd.  Everything she does is because women of a certain age have to change how we do makeup.  Love her!

Seriously, Kandee...you could put kids slime on your face and still be gorgeous! Your Mom is just as beautiful and is a sweetie! 2 lil' pcs of advice. Mama needs a bit darker of foundation and needs to draw her eyebrows out further and a bit thicker. <3
Twins!!!! Love these two
Twins!!! Y’all are both beautiful

It’s funny how patronizing kandee is about her moms lack of makeup and tools but her mom did her makeup better thanks kandee ever does 🤷‍♀️

The way your mom does her makeup that's exactly how I do mine without the bronzer so funny
Maybe do a video where you recreate your Mom's instagrams or she recreates yours!! I love that you look so much like your mom and are so close. My whole life I've been told I look like my mom and I always make sure to say thank you because my mom is the best person I know. She is beautiful inside and out.

Your mom is gorg! I see where you get it from. And you talk and laugh the same! Love it.
I love your videos with your mom.  I am her age and I can totally relate to her make up. What was the mascara she loves and lip liner ?
Your Mom is so beautiful just like you. At least you will know how gorgeous you will look when you get older. I want to see a video where you do her makeup.
Your mom is beautiful !! Omg. For real   No wonder your a beautiful person as well
Kandee! Love the relationship you and your mom have. <3 <3  I think it would be fun for you to do your mom's makeup from when she was your age. I'd love to see that.
Omg your mom is the cutest! Now I know where you get your personality and looks from! Candee you should make another video with your mom, doing your mother’s makeup! Or teaching her your techniques !! That would be awesome 👏🏼 💕💕💕
You need to buy your mom a huge present-like a car-because she gave you her beauty and personality!! haha  Both of you are simply gorgeous!!!! Favorite video!!!
You guys are precious! It was so fun watching this video because you were having so much fun!
I would love to see u do ur moms makeup.. a little glam!! Love to watch u work!
Your mom is precious I can see where you get your looks , this was a  fun video and very inspiring as your mom was so cute telling what happens as we start aging , I am 57 yrs. old so yeah less is better 😜 I just love you 😍
I thought that was you with a grey wig on!!!
Kandee! I love your videos! I also follow you on Snapchat! What first made you want to make makeup videos? I’ve been wanting to but man I don’t use high end makeup (I use whatever Walmart has) and i really haven’t done much makeup in the last 3 years. I’d really love to talk to you some time and get some more tips!
YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE YOUR MOM AND ITS MAKING ME CRY BECAUSE YOU TWO ARE SO ADORABLE
Your mom is so cute. I love that she love to makes friends everywhere she goes. The make up looks good on both of you.
I loved this video!! Ahhh!! Your mama is gorgeous. You all look so so much alike. I am totally following your mama on IG. This made me so beyond happy!! I’m so close to my mama too and I’m so much older than you, I’m 42!!

your mom and you are so pretty and cute!!!
I loved the video. i feel connected to your mom's way of old school make up lol. Keep filming videos with her. Please state what is the apropriate make up for older women. Thanks for sharing . God Bless
Mom is so cute! And you do look like her.
you and your mom are so beautiful i so enjoy watching your videos am an older viewer and i normally do not wear makeup simply because i am not very good at putting it on correctly and also it usaully breaks me out , but i do love watching your videos , God bless u both
I have the same make up bag. But mine was in a big set. Lol
two of the sweetest people in the world! do more videos with your mom i love you guys  😁
Your mom is so beautiful!! You two are twins!!
Can you please do your mom's makeup in a video? Like full beat down all the way from Foundation, concealer, setting powder, blush, bronzer, highlighter, lashes, Etc... That would be an amazing video!
Your mom is so pretty, just like u. I remember u doing a video a long time ago of u doing her hair blonde.
This is the cutest video.  Your mom is so beautiful, as are you and everyone in your family. Your entire family is full of beautiful people who have gorgeous souls.   I love you so much Kandee
Can you make a video of you doing your mom's makeup and maybe her doing hers how she does it one the other side? I would love to see the difference it would make
you guys are the cutest!! Your mom is so beautiful
You look just like your momma... 💗💗💗💗 you both are BEAUTIFUL with the most inviting smile ever!!!!!! That's why mom makes new friends, smiles that light up the room.. @kandeejohnson love this video... ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I laughed so hard watching this. You are hilarious with each other.  Advise your mom to use hourglass ambient powder as a all over powder to filter the appearance of lines. ( my super secret 😉)
You both are just beautiful and adorable.  Please do a video with her where you gift her with makeup you recommend for her and do her makeup. It would be interesting to see the difference, although what she is doing works well on her.
❤❤
You guys are so cute!  Let mom do your makeup next time and you do hers.
You guys are the cutest!
You and your mom are just so cute! Love n hugs to both of you
I love your mom’s makeup!
Your mum is the nicest!!😍
Okay wow your mom does makeup so pretty! You actually look better with your makeup like this. We can actually see how nice your face is!! 👌🌼🧡
You look lovely Kandee! Like the girl next door! And your mom looks like the hot mamma next door hehe ☺️❤️🌹
Such an adorable video! :)
Que video tan bello !!!😍😍😍 kandee cuando tú nena esté grande ara un video contigo !!!!  Awwwww
kandee how did you get your hair so blonde?
Your mom is so cute! Love her!
I like it. Makeup is art. Everyone does it differently. There’s not a right or wrong way. As long as you feel beautiful and confident, then you’re doing it right.
Awww don’t make fun of your mom😞
Super cute mom and daughter bonding. It reminds me  of me ans my mom!!!! Super cute Kandee!!!
I love that you not only used your moms make up but applied it like she does! Awesome twist to the challenge 😁
Aw, I missed the little lip pout Kandee does when she applies eye shadow.
I love you soooo much Kandee!!!<3 Love when your family members are in your videos :)
Your mom is adorable
Y’all are so cute
Your mom is sooooo beautiful
Your mom looks like a pretty Rosanne Bar
anyone else living for Kandee’s mom’s makeup I mean her skin looks gorg😂😍❤️
Your mum is adorable.
Great video!  You get your great looks from your mom.
Your mom is so pretty : ) You look like her!
Am i seeing twins right now.
Twinzies💗
I’m gonna go buy this mascara!
Kandee I think it is wise to kinda to go easy on this youtube stuff as the venus is in retrograde season from september to at least january next year. It's the best time to reflect and focus on your personal life. More personal videos would be great. I miss youuu. The reason I started watching beauty stuff on youtube was you. I don't wear make up but I like watching you teach stuff.
Awww show your sweet mama how to use bronzer and color match her Kandee cane♥️ she’s gorgeous though ..you guys look alike. I hear little Ellie 🐻laughing in the beginning♥️💕 thanks for a cute video! Missed you lots. Love you kandee♥️💫 hi mommmaa and Ellie!!
Mom, you don’t have an eye lash curler...?! “I don’t need one”😆 hahaha!! You’re twinsies!! This video really warmed my heart because I am the same age as you Shannon and totally understand WHY you do your makeup this way. Less is more as we get older! You are so beautiful!!! Still can’t get over how young you look! Keep doing what you do because it’s working ! Kandee, I Love you sooo much! Big Huggies to you and your Mom!!
I have been following you for YEARS! And I love you so much! You’re so genuine and nice. I feel like you don’t shove products down our throats and you actually post entertaining videos! Keep on being an amazing creator💜 and your mom is FABULOUS! Her teeth and skin are perfect! xoxo💜
Shes so cute
Your mom is so nice and sweet ! I love her ! And you too so much! I love that mascara too!I need to go get some actually! Lol 
Good video! Love hugs and glitter! Heeheehee! ;) I'd love to see your mom get a makeover from you using all glitter products! Anything shimmer! Whatia think! It'd be fun! And she said she likes glitter and sparkles ;) XOX
👍🏻
You look like twins.
When Kandee used to use the beauty tubes mascara she was also doing that "waiting for the white coat to dry" even back then. I am kind of surprised she hasnt noticed this doesnt give the best outcome. You arent supposed to let it dry, but rather follow up with the black step right after. The products are supposed to kind of gel together. Its in the instructions. If I waited for the first step to dry I would feel like I was just painting black over crusty hard white lashes. Different topic, Shannon's comment "there are friends waiting for you everywhere you go" is such a sweet sentiment and a great approach. I love that. Wonderful video :)
🤗😚
So cute this reminds me of my moms makeup routine, I love makeup and I try teaching her new tricks and give her tips but she sticks to her ways just like your momma 💕 I also give her all this makeup and she always uses her old makeup lol
Wow I wish I had your genetic makeup, both absolutely beautiful, I'd like video of you buying your mam her makeup, and then giving your mam makeup tips? 🤔 😁😘 Saying that I loved Shannon's makeup, it was simple and it worked, I heard a little giggle at the start, am guessing Ellie was watching too. love to you all xxx ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Yayyyyy, I love when your family is in the videos lol...you make me smile!  AND KANDEE...look how close to 4M subscribers you are!!!!!! oh my gosh I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who left the house with mascara primer on without the mascara hahahaha....and sadly I lost my mom a couple years ago unexpectedly so since I've already started following your mom on IG I will go ahead and adopt her as my mom :)
Ok... I have really bad hooded eyes... when I look in the mirror there is hardly any lid space visible.. I would love to be able to do a cut crease or well any of the bomb af eye looks that you do but dont know how.. any suggestions? Maybe a tutorial for hooded eyes? And winged liner? ♡♡♡ love always 💋💋
Can we get a video like this but with your sister????
Your mom is just the most adorable thing ever. Such beautiful ladies! You should do more videos with her and your sister, or your kiddos.
My mom has the same suction mirror! 😂 she can not be without it. Hey Kandee, now we know where she stays up late, with her many Instagram friends 😂🙃
I kind of like the look of the shimmer in the crease... Love momma Shannon! So full of life!
I have the same suction cup mirror that I use to pluck my eyebrows. Haha! You girls remind me of me and my daughters 😂😂 My eyeshadow is older than hers 😂 I love a little sparkle, too ✨💖 🤗 You girls are so beautiful 😍 Shannon is always so kind to me when I comment on her Instagram 🙌🏻 She’s the sweetest ✨🌸🙏🏻
Sooo cute. I loved that too faced palette. Just sold it to a collector :)
Moms so cute and you look great in her makeup. I’m glad to see you are still here.
Kandee I love the way you have fun with your mom I am 64 and my daughter laughs at me because I have so much cosmetics and brushes and beauty blenders and I love how you are such a free Spirit and always smiling
It is funny Kandee is laughing at Mom, but Mom looks gorgeous and Kandee looked very natural and pretty following mom’s directions- very fresh and youthful.💕 The Too faced bronzer actually works great as an all over setting powder for her skin tone. People do that all the time with foundation powder, so why not a bronzer your color?
sweetest video ever! sending to my mom now. :-*
You both are absolutely beautiful. Please, NEVER share mascara. Even if you're related. That's how you get eye infections. As someone who went through 6 months of vision therapy, your eyes are not something to mess with.
Kandee is all of us with those Too Faced dark browns and blacks with the friggin glitter. But why tho??? 😂
I love your Mom, Kandee! I follow her on IG. She is the happiest person. She commented back to me on a post, I was so excited! I'm "thedarlingdebs" there :) Thanks for doing a video with her. However she does her makeup, she always looks beautiful. HUGS to you both and lots of love too. xo!
I always love you and your mama videos! You are both beautiful inside and out....Now after this video I don’t now if you or your sister ...which one looks more like your mom.....
My mom does bronzer all over her face too and the first time she showed me, I had the same reaction 😂😂
Okie dokes I'm scrapping all beauty influencers and going with your mom's makeup tips :) she looks amazeballs. Love the two of ye xx
Your mom is adorable !! Y’all do look so much alike
Shan's "I love a little sparkle!" <3 8:28
And now we know what Kandee is going to look like when she is older. She is stunning!
Omg your mum is so adorable
You guys make my heart happy
My mom is my ♥️ so this was a fun video to watch.  You are so much like your mom, HOW SWEET!!!
How do people have different nails all the time? Are they the glue on kind? They can’t be gel can they if they’re changed up that much?
You're both sweet and I love your mum's makeup, she's beautiful and her make up on you looked lovely and natural. What mascara does she use? I love tube mascara and haven't come across that one. Could you list the products she uses?
Omg! Shes so cute! You should film picking out your moms makeup!
She’s too cute, I love seeing you too.
ROTFL
i feel like the lip color is wrong for your skin, it looks great on your mom bc she's more tan but you're more pale so it's a bit off.
You two already look so much alike. Like I imagine you’re gonna look exactly like your mom when you reach her age and I imagine that she looked exactly like you when she was in her twenties. And I’m saying this as the highest compliments I can give because you’re both stunningly gorgeous.
I think this make up look actually made you look more like your daughter!
So disappointed that the video doesn’t play in high definition? Shannon is stunningly gorgeous. Please grow old gracefully like your mom Kandee. No need to go to Dr Ourian (kardashian doctor) anymore!
you are a spitting image of your mom with or without makeup.
Could you do a video with your Mom with her trying the new make up you were going to give her ? x
Kandee I think you should put what's in your makeup bag on your mom
Sadly only made it to 12k yikes her channel is dead
Kandee if you close your eyes, it just sounds like you're talking to yourself for the whole video 😂
❤️❤️ I love the lip color!
Beautiful!
Y’all are cute!!💕
Oh this is pretty! Are you going to do your moms make up your way???
Can I have another color so I look like Im alive -kandee
AWESOME VIDEO ❤️❤️
Your mom is absolutely stunning! I swear if you had silver hair or she had blonde you guys would look like twins.
I have all the same items! Same colors too!!!!! Love her.
I love your mom!
Tu mami is beautiful!!! Que bella!!!!
So fun!!! Love your mom😍❤️
I thought she was quitting youtube
I thinl her foundtion color suits your face more than the colors you choose for you own face :0
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
Your mom is beautiful. You look a lot alike . Your a nice daughter 💕⭐️👍🏻
Beautuful ladies!
clothing will it fit?
Does anybody know what mascara she used in this video?
My mom puts lip balm on over her lipstick too!
Omg twins!
I’d love to try the mascara but L’Oréal tests on animals.  Boooooo
Love it when you have your mom on!!! Beautiful!!
Awesome fun video!  “You have friends waiting for you everywhere you go!” ~Shannon Johnson. ❤️❤️❤️👏🏻🥰🙏🏻
Too cute ! 😍💕💕
I thought y’all looked like twins before the make up too hahah!
Mom 😍😍😍
Your mom and you look like you don’t age. I’m shook.
IVE BEEN USING THAT MASCARA FOR THE LONGEST OF TIME AND THEY DONT SELL IT IN SPAIN ANYMORE! I have to go to Andorra to buy it. Best mascara eeeeeeeeeeeeveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
I like your makeup like moms.    I want to do my makeup like hers.
love your mom, do more videos with her. youre so sweet to your mom. love watching this. when my mom visits, i'm always doing her make up and giving her more too. :)
I can’t stop laughing! This is awesome. Reminds me of the time I did my mom’s makeup 😂  “Can I have another color?” 😂
I love all of your hair colors! But out of all of them I think this light of a color blond is my least favorite, it almost washes you out. Any dark colors look awesome on you! Any ideas for a new color anytime soon? Please don't get offended! eeep >.<
You look like twins. Beautiful sweet ladies!
Too cute. You guys are just like me and my daughter. Shows you can look fabulous even when you dont have your  own makeup.
Oh my goodness your mom is so cute!!!
Your mom is SO PRECIOUS! I love how happy you both are. Me and my mom call each other our  “happy partners” when we need cheering up! Lol this video was so cute! Also does anyone know what mascara that was!?
Ur mom is just gorgeous  she does her and it works
👍👍
Kandee I miss you!! Do more makeup tutorials. Do a fall makeup tutorial
My mom doesn’t have an eyelash curler either because she thinks they’re scary 😂
You guys are twins!
Twins!!!
My daughter has that same makeup bag😊
You should have your mom do your makeup, I would love to see that.
Bellissima la tua mamma❤😘
❤️
Your mom is so cute!! Also you really look like her more with this makeup look!
Awe,, you guys are twins..let your cute little mom go shopping in all your PR makeup!! Mom should get to pick out some freebies💜
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
I love your mom
Too cute :)
very good, subscribed to your channel
💞💞💞
It looks really nice on your mom, but for some reason you look paler than your mom so you need some more make up definition on your nose and cheeckbones to make them stand out and then it would look perfect.
Awe yes please do more videos with your sweet mom! I can totally do with an extra mom. My mom died 5 years ago and I know she's in heaven and was saved and I still love her dearly, but your mom is also so amazing! I see where your personality comes from and you guys totally look like twins!
I love your mom!!! 💋💄❤️
You look the age.
Next video I would love to see with your mom, is your mom shop for outfits for you lol
You know what’s funny... the makeup items seem odd, but she looks beautiful. Haha. We know what works for us. Lol. Beautiful ladies!
Like watching twins lol
You both are so Precious 💕 I love her color of lip liner! You two are the best 😘
I use they same mirror for my eyebrows
Y’all are presh!!! AND are twins!!!!
I see where Kandee gets her looks from. Two pretty ladies.
Omg Kandee you and your mom are soo gorgeous I’m sooo jealous love you you both hugs 🤗💖
❤❤❤❤
Your mom is so cute!
Your mom is the cutest!
You look like sisters
You are two stunningly beautiful women. I may have to incorporate your mom’s tip related to sparkle and wrinkles being a woman of a certain age myself. Love sparkle!
I haven’t been sleeping well tonight due to my anxiety and pain from my multiple chronic illnesses. Seeing that you posted cheered me up. It so nice to see you back on the YouTube’s again. Your mom is so beautiful and you look so much like her— beauty on the inside and out. 🤗💜 I love the rapport between the two of you— it’s very similar to how my mom and I get along and act around each other. Momma love is the best 💕🐶
In one of ur older videos with ur mom u told her that u r going to give her one of ur lashcurlers.
Wow you 2 look beautiful. Your mom reminds  so much me about my mom' s friend. She looks so much like her is amazing! My mom' s friend is hispanic too ( as Mom) and I thought maybe your mom is hispanic or have hispanic background. I found out on Internet that your Mom has danish and Mexican grandparents!
I had a crazy dream about kandee last night lol

Apparently she cut her hair super short, mostly dark brown with blonde at the top. She traveled to Louisiana JUST so i could do her hair. But then she walked out without paying  😂😂😂😂
nice!!!!
Now let your mom do her makeup with your travel makeup bag
Love you and your mom together, you guys are so cuuuuuuuuuuuutttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
You look like your mom....the both of you are just too cute!
You look so great with your mom's makeup
you guys make me smile !! Now I'm going to ask my mom to do her makeup    she doesn't wear anything except lipstick
Mama knows best! 😄 what a beautiful video. 💕💕
OMG I love when you do videos with Mom! ❤️
This is so awesome!! I absolutely love your mom!! You both are so beautiful!! ❤️❤️
Your Mom is such a beautiful ray of sunshine!! 💛 I think you should do a makeup haul video for your Momma!! Oooor turn your Mom into you for the day!!
Yay for Moms!!
I see where you got your positive outlook on life. Your mom is amazing please bring her on your channel more often.
I love you bringing back your sign off saying! It really is sweet and inspiring. I think I might put it on a mug for myself for daily Kandee inspo with my coffee :)
I love this.  You two have a beautiful bond!!!!
Your mom is so cute...
You look just like your mom!!!  Both of you are beautiful!!!  💕💕
❤️ this!  Wish I had this type of relationship with my mom.
So beautiful! 💗
This was awesome! I just shared with my mom because you both sound like us when we get together and do our makeup (we live across country from each other). And my mom still uses the original UD naked palette that's probably 4 years old at this point :-)
She should do your makeup
You both are so beautiful 💖💓💕👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 everyone lol
your mom is so sweet this is adorable
I love her hair! You should dye yours grey Kandee!
It’s so obvious where Kandee gets her personality! These two are basically the same person, just one is by older!
Beautiful genes! And beautiful ladies inside and out!! 💖💖💖💖
Your mom looks just like you! Two lovelies
Your momma is adorable! I'm so happy you are making videos again! Your my favorite and I have missed you❤❤❤
The sharpener is 20 to 30 years old Lmao your mom is funny.
I love your videos with your mom!  So fun! Love your laughs. This had me smiling the whole time! 💜
Kandee, you should do you moms makeup 😍😘❤️🌟💫✨ great mom and great positiv video ❤️
You look just like your beautiful mama!
Awww so cute!!!!!! ❤️
Beautiful! Ever consider going back to your dark hair again?
I love your mom's makeup on you!
How was skin wars
Miss the natural Kandee. Before the Botox and lip injections
Make more videos!! So refreshing!!!
Omg I have the same makeup bag as her mom!!! lol i feel oddly connected to Kandee now! even though I own her two faced makeup palette and her nail polish... still I feel special lool 😂
CUTIES💞💞💞💞
You look like your mom
💘👯
Ohh, Kandee, you should reverse it and give your mom your travel makeup bad and coach her through doing her makeup!
Kandee, for the next video, can you do a makeup tutorial of meg from Disney's Hercules?
ummmm I do my makeup almost exactly like your mom does 😀😀😀💜. I would love to see you doing her makeup..I'll look through your videos to see if you have already!
Hi Kandee, been a long time fan and subscriber of your channel. Wondering if you have any tips for Makeup for people with Bells Palsy? The right side of my face is paralyzed and i love makeup. I cant find any YouTube videos for people with Bells Pasly that want to wear makeup. I could use the help😉
what’s the mascara?
... and then do a vid of all of mom’s NEW makeup.  Y’all are fab!!✨💖
I follow your mom on insta but not you 😳 ... cried at the end.. Bless you both ❤️⚓️
Your mom is the best!!! 😆 also if you did my makeup look you would laugh. I now only wear a moisturizer.. haha
Your mum is so beautiful!!!!!! Love you both!!! :-)
I love the both of yall soooooo much. Moms are so special!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I've always loved it when your mom is in your videos!! xx
I really love your granny, but your mom is the absolute bomb! 💓💖💗💥 You two look like twins....😜😁😍😘😘😘😘😘👍✌️
I’m so jealous of your moms teeth. Lol she’s so incredibly beautiful.
Your mom is just as beautiful as you are.
I’m dying y’all are a hoot. I feel like I’m watching my mom and myself when I’m trying to help her with her makeup. The smiles are definitely infectious! Much love to you both! ❤️💗💗
This was fun!! You have to do more videos with your mom she’s awesome!!
awwww I love mom!!!
🖤
Super !!!!
I love you and your mom!  So crazy.  I sometimes use bronzer as my setting powder.  Or I use Bare Minerals Matte foundation powder to set my makeup.  Since I have such dry skin it works good that way to keep my makeup from getting flaky.  I just switched from using a toner to using witch hazel and my face loves me for it.  It helps keep my face so much more hydrated.
Kandee I love your mom!! What an angel
Kandee, you still look most beautiful with no makeup---you are naturally beautiful!
more mom videos!
TOO CUTE
Your mom is adorable
OMG....you are gorgeous sweet  beautiful amazing!!! I follow your mom on IG :) LOVE YOU KANDEE ❤️

👭
She’s so sweet! I love your mom! She’s like my mom. My mom only had me, but she’s “adopted” all the kids that she meets. We would have dinner at night when I was in high school and there would be 10 kids eating with us including some I didn’t even know! I don’t know if you guys like to bake, but a baking video with you two would be cute!
My mom uses bronzer as powder too, she says she likes the way it looks and feels it’s not too heavy.
Morning
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shannon and Kandee 😍😍😍😍😍😍 I love it!!!!!! 💋💋💋💋💋
Can you have your mom in every video?
I get so excited to see your mom in videos! She’s the cutest!
You guys looks like twins... Don't forget your sister... More like triplets. Your mom is just living her life to the fullets. We love her too.
Sweet video! You look just like your mom Kandee! And yes her teeth are awesome.
Lol kandee please get her a new palette hahaa
Love you Kandee💕
seventh comment
i love uuuu
♥️ you
Hi Kandee and Kandee's mom!
I love y’all
https://youtu.be/xvOZQweFOZg
kandee you look so much like your mom
Мама -красотка!! 👍👍👍
Kandee you and your mom are so adorable!
Do your moms makeup
Gosh y’all are the cutest
Your mom is beautiful!!! I know it’s rude to ask, but how old is she? She looks so young!
Awww your mom is so pretty! My mom and I were trying to reconnect after over 2 decades apart when she was found dead in her bed last week. They are saying it was due to poor health, she died in her sleep. I have dreamed of doing things like this with her my whole life, but it will never happen. She didn’t wear makeup anyway. To those who have moms who were always in their lives...be grateful! Appreciate her.
I like ur mom’s style of makeup, I’m just like her, lol.
She’s PRECIOUS! My gosh YOUR SIS and your mom have so many of the same mannerisms! Y’all are three of a kind!
I love love love momma Shannon!!!!!!!!
OMG. Mum doesn’t look like ur mum she looks like ur twin sister.
Kandee Please come back to YouTube when I was a teenager u kept my mind busy and away from the suicidal thoughts now I'm almost 30 with a beautiful 7 year old daughter and a man that loves me and would do anything for me I wouldn't have them in my life if I had given in to those thoughts that u distracted me from . I understand that you may be sick of makeup videos but u can do other things and we would still be happy. Cooking shows, house tour, d.i.y's, skin care, reacting to ur first video, favorite craft supplies, how you handle your busy schedule, if u still rub lemons on ur face. I can think of so many more things I would enjoy seeing you do if ur sick of making makeup videos but just come back with all this negativity in the beauty community now I think we need someone like you to be popular than these toxic people we have now
Twins
Twins!
Great video
Cute video
Too pale
This is such a cute video! Did you give your mom some tips after this?
Kandee, you look like a barbie doll with your blonde hair & this makeup look!  Also, I love you & your momma!  ♡♥♡
Your mom looks more like your sister than she does your mom
Twins
Your mom just shows that there is no “right way” of using makeup, just do whatever makes you happy. You want to use bronzer as a setting powder then go ahead, you want to put white eyeshadow all over your lid, go ahead.
Hehe
Hi Kandees mum! 👋
Fun!
Ur Mom is so Beautiful. I think that too I’m talk to everyone also. My ex used to say I could talk to anyone. And I do. My son says that my friends online r my Fake friends because we don’t ah g out. But they r not fake. I jumped all over him. Lol. Just because we don’t live close and get to do things doesn’t mean we r fake. I’m probably ur moms age I turned 50 this year. I moved about five yrs ago. And it’s hard to make friends to run around with when ur kids r grown and no neighbors ur age. It’s a college town.
This trip was so much fun! All the feels and memories. Thanks for inviting me! #DoubleTrouble 😊✈️💕🐿️
You are a breath of fresh air in the beauty community Kandee.. I 100% admire you ❤️
Stops working the second Kandee posts because she knows how much WORK Kandee put into this video and life in general xoxoxo ❤️❤️❤️
The queens of youtube are living their best lives! GOALS UPON GOALS UPON GOALS! ⭐💖⭐💖⭐💖⭐💖
Aww that looked like so much fun!!
Thank you for staying up for six days and editing this !!! you did an amazing job!!! And you can tell how much work you put into this❤️I felt like I was with you guys on vacation❤️ And I love that you and  @RosannaPansino are friends!!!, she is a good egg and the absolute cutest
Gosh I love you to bits Kandee!!!  I would love to see you go into hospitals, retirement homes etc and vlog doing ladies make up to make them feel amazing and hearing a bit about their lives rather than collabs with celebrities who have access to their own make up artists. Big hugs from Australia 🇦🇺
Can you please post your workout routine and what you eat in a week?!?!? You look amazing! I wanna lose weight. Hope you see this kandee 💕 xo loved you since day 1! (: Show us what you make to look amazing!
Giiirl I'm early but don't know what to comment
Kandee, are you doing okay?
I worry sometimes that your bubbly personality seems like a cover up. I care about you and I just hope if you are stressed or unhappy that you find that perfect balance in your life ❤️
Your hair looks amazing Kandee! Xx
I have loved the YEARS of watching you grow Kandee. Im so proud of you and all you have done. Love you!!
So happy to see you back on YouTube. Love you!! As someone who’s followed you since the beginning it makes me so happy to see how far you’ve come 💚💚

I love the vibe surrounding you. So positive. 😊
I love you Kandee, I have been a subscriber for YEARS.  I do feel like something is off though, like there is a disconnection.  No matter what I will always be a fan and I will always be rooting for you to do what is best for YOU and what makes YOU happy,  whatever that may be! 👍💕✌💌
I love that you do all this while loving Jesus. You deserve this my love.. I’ve been watching you for 9 years ❤️⚓️
O how I would just DIE to get to go on a TOO FACED release trip with all of you amazing fun makeup artist! Love you Kandee💗💗💗😘😘

Love you girl 😘❤️
This was soooooo fun! 🤸‍♀️Thank you for sharing your trip Kandee!!💕💕
I swear  I just had to get off the interstate and pull over so I didn't kill anyone trying to watch and drive!! Lol... ♡♡♡ u kandee and all u do and girl


 The blonde is so rockin and you!!!!
The editing was amazing. That vlog was fantastic.
Hey babe, I saw your Snapchat and would also be devastated after putting so much time and energy into something and not getting the expected results. I'm not a youtuber but here are my thoughts: 
1) You still have a TON of views! Maybe not what you are used to but more than I've ever had. These are people who truly love and want to know your every life detail. That is AMAZING! 
2) I honestly didn't get to watch all of it because of life and kids going on. But also I felt that I had seen what I wanted to see from your snaps and insta. 
3) I think it's totally fine for you to not be a vlogger. I mean I think you are incredibly talented but at what cost? You basically vlog 24 hrs a day via your snaps and things. That is more than enough! 
4) Save those videos for yourself and your kiddos unedited, like back in the 90s when that was life. 
5) I still hope to see fun makeup tutorials and transformations but they don't have to be that often. Maybe save that for when you have the time and really want to do it? 
LASTLY I truly love you! And think you are just so inspiring.  You are such a bright light and the only person I see out there who doesn't fake promote or bash anyone/anything. Also, and most importantly I can see you are a good Mom. Watching your earlier vlogs shows just how much you've been through and how far you've come. Being a mom and doing all that you do and having health issues cannot be easy. And having to leave them to travel for work is so hard but what a great example you set for them! 

Anyway this is longer than intended and you probably won't read it but I just wanted you to know from my heart 600 miles away to yours, you are appreciated, admired, and adored. I know I'm not the only one, but just touching one soul and inspiring one life is more than enough!
I love you! My sweet KandeeGirl!🍭🍬🍫
I love how humble and down to earth you are about everything! Btw you're so gorgeous, why aren't you a model??
Girl I cried from happiness for you. 💕💕💕
Loving the uploads and you Kandee! Lots of love from Norway!
You're so pretty! Thanks for uploading 😀
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS COLLECTION

Yay Kandee! Love you girl! Congrats on the collaboration 😘😘
You deserve this and SO much more Kandee! I'm so happy for you!!❤
I stopped filing...lol. I love Rosanna..😁
To much volume difference. Loud to squiet to very loud to very quiet - I stopped trying to understand the words - could not stand the sudden blow of high volume hitting next.
So, just from the view: it seems like a spectacular weekend(?) with so much spoiling going on there. so much luxury. And Rosana, so much positive energy, freshness and joy comming from her (don't know her though). Nice to see so much fun. I would surely not blend in, even if I could afford this.
Such a great video, full of smiles and love!!!! Such an awesome way to start the day!!!!
Yaaaasss✔️💕💕💕🔥🔥🔥
I love this!!!❤️
Awww U are so grateful it’s so cute.

I’m not a make up person but wow these look yummy 🤤 lol congratulations and God bless you
This line looks very nice and summery, which leads to my question...why is this coming out in mid August?  Would it have been more beneficial to release this line in the spring?
You got it going on girl,so happy for you and great to see ur beautiful face 😘🤘
I just love your spirit and all the amazing things headed your way!!!!  I know you have worked so hard for this and I am soooooooooo proud of you,  and so happy for you!  Much love!
Will you please do an updated makeup tutorial?! I am loving your makeup in the last two videos!! You are just stunning.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE that Cuban music was being blared on this trip! It got my little Cuban heart so excited 😂😂😂 🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺#CeliaCruz #Guantanamera #lavidaesuncarnaval #Cuba
Ro and Kandee are friendship goals 😂❤️
Girl, you deserve this beautiful weekend and more! What a wonderful pick me up during a dull week for me :-) Congrats on being "The Face." I love the new Too Faced line. AND your clothes/accessories were everything! We love you, hope you keep up the vlogs or whatever you have time for, just appreciate you so much. Keep Shining!
Oh my goodness do you look beautiful!!! They couldn't have found a more fitting face of Tutti Fruitti, you are so wild and fun! I am actually excited for this launch, the shadows look beautiful and while I enjoy the Peach foundation, I am a little dry especially in the winter so I think this foundation will suit me better. My 20 yr old daughter (😳 shhh yes 20!) is SO fair with blonde hair blue eyes and TooFaced is one of the few foundations with a light enough color so thank you so much @TooFaced 😘💋
That trip looks amazing 😻🍍🍓🍌
Omg you and Ro are so funny together! Two peas in a pod with both your energetic personalities!
Living her best life in this vlog❤️

What I really love is that you are genuinely SO excited and take this luxury for granted. We all wish to be there and experience this but it is also easy to say "You deserve this!!"without jealousy bc you work hard and are so humble about your success.
Kandee is the best travel buddy!! 💎🕶🙌💋
You look AH. MAZING !! Gorg
The video quality is bad 😞
Kandee you’re so gorgeous, luv u to bits. Congrats on being the face of this collection🎉🎉🎉
One thing I’ve noticed though is ur lighting is way too bright when ur filming so it’s hard to c the true colours of products etc xx
Omg did I see Payton list?!?!? She looked so left out xD
"i cried three times yesterday" -ro super proud of this fact
Shot everytime Kandee says, "you guys...." 😂😂😂😂😂 Congrats on everything and happy to see you back.
Oh I love this!!! Looks so much fun ❤️👏🏻👏🏻
This looks like so much fun, you deserve all your success and wonderful experiences like this!
I loved the vlog style and would love to see more just normal (Non-private jet ha ha), day-to-day vlogs from you.
Love you Kandee! x
So nice to see your positive growth and dressing classy. God bless for more to you and your family!
Loving this video so much, cannot stop smiling 😊💕
You deserve all of this!!  You see the best in everyone & live a truly joyful life.  Not to get all deep, but i think that this is how God intended us to live (grateful & joyful) & this is why you are reaping the benefits!!  Luv you!
Being back ur banana powder!!!! Plz. It's been the best I've tried

You ran into my daughter's friend Lauren (photo with you at 19:30) she was so excited to meet you.

my mom's idea for a tittle: "lets tutt (toot) the fruit"
You are such a sparkle and beautiful bright light for everyone ✨✨✨

This breaks my heart two of my favorites totally failing Kandee you are uo at 3 am why?!?
Love you Kandee ❤️
So I love the video but is that Sylvia Gani I spy in the background? I love her lol and I love how Rosanna was with y’all. This video makes me happy lol
You exposed ro
I use the same pallet every day too xoxoxo it still smells amazing haha i got it the day it launched
So fun! BTW, can you do a “what I eat in a day” video? I know you’re vegan now so I’d love to see what plant based foods you’re eating to stay in shape! Thank youuuu!
Your sunglasses are so freaking cute! Where can I find them
I want ALL OF THAT. Oh my gosh. Worst possible time to be on extreme budget crisis.
Always and forever so thankful to be apart of the Kandee family. You are the most genuine, sweet, kind, uplifting, encouraging, deserving woman of all you have. You’ve worked so hard and it’s payed off. So happy to see so many of your dreams coming true. You’ve never given up. You’ve persevered all while holding the hands and hearts of us all. To me, you’ll always be someone I cherish and talk about as if you’re a friend in my daily life. I know I’ve commented this a billion times over the years but Kandee, you’ve changed my life. Your sweet voice, life and makeup lessons etc have stayed with my heart and been something I have passed on to others. You’re a gift that keeps giving. Shine on you rainbow!
Loved this video!! goin to Ulta pronto!
God take Great Care of Kan Kan
This is so A-Mazing 🍍🍓🍒🍌🍉 Looks like you had a Beautiful Vacation 😊 Sorry, but I just want to let you know that I wish Too Faced would make your Matte Liquid Lipstick in "Freshly Baked" (obviously your palette too, which I dearly love) a permanent to their brand. I have 2 of them and I still feel like it's not enough. Honestly, It's my most used and loved out of all my matte liquid lipstick's I own. This new Tuity Fruity Collection looks so fun and pretty 😍 I can't wait to see it in person! I ❤you
My heart for you Kandee smiles for all that God has shown you.
Kandee is your hairrrr or a wig !!??? Is soooo beautiful 💖💖💖
You are so stunning !!! 💜
Love the sharing, looks like a ton O’ FUN!!!
Looks amazing! But my first question was how much too faced actually spent on this launch, the swag, private jet, hotel, etc???
So cute! That hotel was out of this world 🌎 Wow 😮
That is nice that the two of you sponsor one another.  Congratulations on being the face for Tutti Fruitti collection.
That looked like heaven. Someday it'll be me. If that palette smells like the 80s Strawberry Shortcake dolls, I have to have it!!
Cant wait to see the make up from Too Face !!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩💞💞💞🙏🙏
KANDI JOHNSON! FABULOUS FUN!  ...now we when you are ready, let's see you do some great makeovers of ALL ages!  YOU have the know how and personality to do it  RIGHT! (I LOVE  Christopher Hopkins, but he seems to have stopped making videos)
I’VE ARRIVED
wow and congrats! new here and wish you all the happiness in the world!
I am so excited and want so much of this collection
I’m so proud of you!
Kandee!  I too, still wear your palette!   Still my favorite set of colors for any look       X♥️X♥️
Kandee you’re looking amazing!!!
Hiii kandee I love you do much you provide motivation and i love you from India
Your palette is my go to everyday also

Oh my gosh, Kandee! Your love is contagious! I super enjoyed your vlog! You are so sweet & kind and deserve what life brings your way! Thanks for sharing a piece of your life with us! I love you! 🍇🍉🍌🍒🍊🍓🥝🍋🍎🍏

Wait is that Peyton List
Has anyone tried the foundation?
Kandee you are perfect as a blonde. This was so much fun.
What resort is this and where?
😱
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
❤️❤️❤️
💗💗💗
Why can't you stay true to who you are you just look to Hollywood now
am i going to be able to get this at Sephora Canada?
I love how she looks blonde!!!! 😭💕💕💕
KANDEE!!!! This was an AWESOME VIDEO & so many things to say! First of all, I LOVED how you added/posted the names of the influencers whom were on cam as it was recording bc so many times on others vids, I hve to like research to find out an influencer’s name if they peeked my interest bc they aren’t mentioned in the vlogs etc. Your gratitude is something many of us should really pray to receive bc it’s absolutely beautiful how grateful and humble you are. I LITERALLY smiled the entire time watching it and lived vicariously thru you in this video! I had NO IDEA Too Faced had launched this on the 15th??? Nor that it would be at Ulta! I supported your collab with them before & although this is not a collab, I will support this launch bc YOUR the face behind it and YOU my love are a whisper of constant goodness.... even thru ur trials, u post inspirational tweets and it does reach a huge audience and KNOW that your vids & ur kindness is like candy! It makes ppl happy and ppl like me, whom are fighting for their lives or for a healthy life, rely on these videos to get a smile, a laugh & entertainment and it helps keep our spirits going.... who would have thought right?? So, beautiful, bc OH MY GOSH YOU ARE ABSOTOOTLEY GORGEOUS!!!! Thank you for this voyage bc I felt like I was in that private jet with y’all!!! The editing is phenomenal!!!! I will be ordering if I’m unable to make it physically to Ulta, these products! Xoxoxo ONE LOVE💜💕💜💖💜💗💜💓💜💞🍬🍭🍬🍭🍬🍭🍬🍭🍬🍭
Oh, may I ask where could I find those pink luggage??? Loved them!!!!
Oh my gosh candy I freaking love this video and I love you and you’re so darn adorable and I definitely would buy two face products because of you but I need tips first because I don’t know how to do make up or any foundation colors I should get it but either way I will buy stuff from you from this brand everybody looks so amazing and you’re so sweet and so funny
Hi my name is Kelley I am a spiritual healer Haswell has a clear plan I have been feeling this strong urge to contact you to tell you that I would like to do a reading for you I’ve watched your videos over the years and by the way I truly love you and all of your videos you are truly an amazing human being kind of like an angel on earth I’ve been doing this for 29 years and I truly believe that God guides me with certain people to help them and to guide them and to deliver messages and I am feeling that urge with you if you are interested in contacting me you can email me at psychics Center 91@Yahoo.com😊🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
At 5:15 Is the blonde hair boy next to rosanna rosanna's boyfriend? 🤔💙

If anyone sees this and knows the answer please reply to my comment so I can know what the answer is too please!?
Kandee where can i find your palette. I want 1 so bad.  Thank you jacqui
Wait was that Payton List?
💜🧡❤️💛💚💙💖💗💕💘💓💞💝🌸🌺🌼🌻🌹🌷💐
🍓🍑🍇🍍🍒LoVe It❣❣🍒🍍🍇🍑🍓
Awww my favs ❤❤❤
Gorg! I’m just curious, is there going to be another trip of just male beauty bloggers? Or maybe I missed seeing the YouTube guys...??
Can someone REALLY be that idiotic? “Ohmygoshyouguys!”
wow i wish
heyyyyyy
What hotel was this? So cool!
how's ur kids
Too faced is doomed get the hat off your head dig you grave and too bad you drug Kandee down with you
Kandee, I recently went back to super blonde hair and am having trouble finding different makeup looks without looking too harsh. Can you please do some makeup tutorials for people with light blonde hair?? I’m loving all your looks and the blonde on you girl. You’re rocking it💋
Wow kandee you have some awesome legs! I’m jealous
My LOVES! Kandee.... why? Whyyyyy?!? Your hair care did so well... why did you ruin it with the too faced line?!? #awful #nogoodreviewsn#whydowefollowyou actually, I follow all your socials we never get anything
So u titled your previous  video just to get views. Yeah unsub
Omg!😍😍🙀🙀 Im SWOONING OVER EVERYTHING DOLL👯‍♀️👯‍♀️ Now I definitely have to go to ulta asap and check out these goods!! ya know I love my KANDEE GIRL👑👑👑👸👸 so deserving too I just love that jerrod from too faced spoiled yall what a guy love him too 🍒🍒🍉🍌🍋🍊 so fruity doll😘😘😘xoxo loves ya !!
💜💟💖
You and Ro are so sweet together! Please film more with her! Perhaps you could do her makeup and she could bake with you?
Ceo of makeup geek revealed the extortion of this community and I’m unsubscribing to every one til I feel my vote matters and I’m not lied to.
Such a fun video Kandee! I just love you..I’m sad that for some reason it didn’t show up in my subscriptions :/ I only saw this from the suggested videos from another video I was already watching
Love the video and all but that pink sombrero? Why? I find it disrespectful to all Mexicans. You would have to know our culture and history behind the sombrero to understand why I feel this way.
So many of my favorite things crammed into one video!!! Kandee, Rosanna, Vlogs and makeup!!!! ♥️♥️♥️
If the vlogs aren’t getting the views you want, try posting more makeup looks! That’s what you’re known for! I feel like you should reach out to Shane Dawson to help your channel because you seem like you’ve lost your inspiration and focus...
Anyone know what hotel this is?
Adorable.
Aww so nice to see you enjoying life! You so totally deserve all things good this life has to offer! You picked the best +1! Ro is so fun! 🌺🍊🍋🍓🍈🥝🥥🍇🍐🍎🍉🍑🍒🍌🍅
Rosanna is so tiny
She is ruined #tutifruitiflop
Who saw the snaps I did!
#collectionenvy I dont understand why Ulta gets better exclusives then Sephora... LAME!
UMMMM 23:59 ??? BUMP???
Ugh, why do you wanna have the long fake platinum hair like KK and the big fake lips?  You are so fake.
You are lovely Kandee. A lovely lovely person. Beautiful. Inside out xx
I WANT TO SEE KANDEE VLOGS!! Thank you for being you! You’ve always been kind and genuine since day 1! You’ve always inspired me and always will! 💙
Kandee, you are a YouTube LEGEND and OG badass beauty guru!! I can imagine how frustrating YT has become, the way some channels have grown...it just isn’t right!! You are by far the most genuine, kind hearted, and passionate YouTuber I’ve met and it shows in every video you make. I say get back to basics, easy makeup tutorials and SKIN CARE 🙏🏼, don’t overthink it. I’ve loved you since day 1, always have, always will! 💞
I started watching you when you were cutting t-shirts from your bedroom. You are amazing. Stay strong  I too have suffered a lot of loss, both my parents and grandparents and in-laws. Live for them because they loved you and honor them everyday. Stay strong you got this girl
Weekly vlog!!!  Now if I just write that 999 more times you'll have thousands of comments so you'll do it! 😁
There might be tears in my eyes reading your comments you guys....I cannot thank you enough and did not even expect even more love in the comments from you all....I wish I could each and every one of you so hard right now...
I wrote you a sad letter 6 years ago and you responded within hours! It really cheered me up when I was in a dark place. Thank you. You’re a very giving and thoughtful person and pausing self-care are well deserved by everyone especially when obstacles in life hit too spaced together to get a breath in. You got this!
I remeber when your dad died. I remeber watching the video and crying with you. My dad (at that time) had passed away 4 years before that. And it was like reliving it through your video. Three months before my sister in law died. We lost two of the most amazing people in my family within months of each other. That pain is unreal. Loss is so hard to get past. 
You are the first YouTuber I watched. Self tanning, skin care routine, just knowing how to do my make up... you got me through my teenage years. 
Thank you for being you- and keeping your positivity. ❤️
Adored you from the start and I’ll adore you forever!!! ❤️❤️
Kandee, even if you uploaded once a month, once a year, whatever...I’d still watch it! You’re my OG BeautyTuber and I always find comfort and strength in the things you say and post. You have the purest heart of anyone. I always just want to fly to you and give you big hugs! Wish I could have you in my life for a friend, a sounding board, and inspiration. Love you girl! ❤️💜❤️💜
Take care of yourself first Kandee! We got your back and support you with whatever you want to do💋
You are beautiful...and amazingly even more beautiful inside. I love you.
Great video.  I’m glad you’re not with MC anymore, I just didn’t feel like he was good for you at all.  You’re an interesting person.  Thanks for sharing 😍
Never stop being the beautiful ray of sunshine that you are Kandee! 🌞💕🍬
I miss your old school tutorials and weekly vlogs! :)
I randomly found your makeup tutorial. You helped me to get out of bad depression 8 years ago, your crazy energy and positive attitude towards everything lifted my spirits, and I thank you for that. Since then I've been following  your page.
When your dad passed away, I lost my grandma, and she was my hero, I felt in some sense, we shared this tremendous loss together. I wept watching your video, relating my pain,and, again, I thank you for sharing.
My heart is full for you, your success with career, and your beautiful healthy children. I wish you only the best things in life.
Sincerely, from my little heart to yours.
You take your time when you are ready to come back - you could make little videos about the people you loved in your life but are no longer with us. These could be honourable tributes to them and be good for you and others to remember the memories. I did the same for my late father and a very good friend (both of whom died within 4 months of eachother). 10 years later I still watch them on my Facebook page, my friend’s daughter loves seeing them every time she needs a pickup of smiles and for my family they enjoy seeing my father’s pics. It’s a form of grieving. You are wonderful and appreciated every video you did xxx
You are such a positive light in this life. Thank you for always being you and for always loving me. 🙏😘
I came searching for You Tonight I needed a Kandee Video.. Thanks so much for your Beautiful Soul and Heart. You are a Unique Beauty and I look up to You and your Love and Pain.. We do need you here.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes, please do Weekly Vlogs, More OLD SCHOOL DIY's!!!! I loved when you used to do those with clothing! More transformations, and creative looks! Love you so much girlie.....I;ve been watching you since the beginning!
You are the most amazing soul ... We are better for being able to watch you. Thank you for that kind Lady *HUGS
Wow, what a blessing of a positiv and happy girl you are 💛 I have no idea who you are but you made me smile and feel good at a time i really needed some love. So thank you for that - and i would watch any topic you choose. You really reached my heart. God bless 🙏🏼
Kandee, I love you, i never received any notifications, even with the bell active, nothing.
I'm so sorry about your losses. Grandparents are SO special. I think about how much I miss mine every day.
Weekly vlogs would be AMAZiiiiiNG ♡ I love seeing those kinds of videos from you
I remember watching you when Ellie was only a cupcake in your belly and I remember always wanting to be like you so sweet and energized. I love your videos and hopefully you do the vlogs. I also remember kandeeland blog it was so much fun watching you!
Oh beautiful, wonderful, free spirited Kandee. Thank you for the past 10 years, you are the ONLY YouTuber which has stayed 100% herself. You haven’t been swayed by society or what everyone else is doing. 

I would LOVE to see weekly vlogs, but also just do all your videos again! 
New products and new techniques! Remember that younger generations need the tips too!
I rarely comment on videos, and I mean RARELY.. but I feel compelled to let you know that I love you so much Kandee, you are everything and more to a girl like me who relates to you SO much. You're a reminder that life happens but it comes down to how we handle situations and grow from them. Your positivity and love makes the world go round. I'm so proud of you and so happy that you are on the internet, you are a breath of fresh air and just wow. PLEASE write that book, id read it a million times. ❤️
O, Kandee, your personal style is just wonderful! This light-pink hoodie is so sweet, and your light-lilac gala-dress is so elegant!
Weekly vlogs would be cool.  Praying for you,  Kandee. I know you have a personal life and respect that.  Much love to you.
Some ideas: creative crafts- if you're into that,  like dyi. I still like your favorite, videos, recipes,  the weekly vlogs. 
So happy to hear from you.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’ve been following you for the last 9 years! I love you and you’ve influenced my life ❤️❤️❤️
YAAAAAAS to weekly vlogs 😍 you are seriously the best makeup artist AND youtuber, I know. Keep going ✌️
You are awesome Kandee! Never ever give up, you inspire people on so many levels. I've been watching your videos for so many years, and I've learned so much from you.
If anybody deserves to be called a guru you are definitely one of them.
Bless you ❤️
Hugs from Denmark
I would love to see your 23 and Me and your body transformation video!!! I’m so glad you’re back Kandee! I love you so much! I’m sending you hugs and love and prayers! ❤️🙏🏻
Dear Sweet Candy-
I’m so sorry to hear of all you have been going through.  I have had a lot of loss recently also.  Keep your beautiful chin up and that awesome creativity flowing 💕
I know how you feel... between January 2017-March 2018 I lost my Granny, my quadruplet nephews and my Memaw who was my best friend. It was a hard 15 months on me and my family
Great video, can't wait to meet you at VidSummit.
oh Kandee girl,  you are so full of life and your incredible external beauty is second to none, and your inner beauty is jaw dropping. I just wanted to hug you and tell you that it's gonna be ok you're so sweet. I hope you get everything you want out of life.
First of all...how the 😳 do you not have 15 million subscribers?? You’re the OG!! Legit! How can people of the beauty community not love you and admire the 10 years you have been doing this?! Keep being you!! I sincerely appreciate everything you do! Xoxo!
You are one of the first people I ever watched on YouTube! I know how it feels to feel uninspired and being through rough times but you are so loved here! I just wish there were more amazing, honest and loving people like you to watch! Weekly vlogs would be amazing xx
I'm fed up with people negating a person's pain and hardships by comparing it to someone else's hardships.
Each person has their own hardships. NO ONE has the right to attack someone hurting because they think what happened is not as serious in their opinion.
WE ALL HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPERIENCE & EXPRESS OURSELVES!
I want to see unedited and low quality videos. lol but for real. My favorite videos of yours are the ones that you posted during your pregnancy. I also really enjoyed your t-shirt cutting videos. I got so many compliments on mine. And I also really enjoyed your jewelry making videos. They were inspirational. You are awesome
Kandee, truly a delightful sweetheart. Genuinely a beautiful soul you are.💖 You've come so far, you keep moving forward.
Omg you dont look like you used to i almost didnt recognize you
We like to keep things inside because we are a ♋ Love you Kandee, always have. Blessings to you ❤ and weekly vlogs would be so much fun.
I’m so glad you are back!! I feel you on losing loved ones and needing time to heal and just be for awhile. 

Any videos you post are awesome. I love tutorials and transformations
You were the first YouTuber I stared watching.. your Halloween videos are the best!!!! We love you stay strong!!!
We all love you no matter what your decision is! Also I love the blonde hair
Daily Vlogs Please!!! I missed your videos. I love your energy and positivity. it makes my day.
You are an amazing person, inside and out, and definitely THE person that has made the biggest impact on my life from social media. Thank you for all that you do, and continue to do - and for being so real with us. Love you lots!! 💖💖
Kandee, you're such a wonderful person with great energy.  So humble and kind.  XO
Shane Dawson where you at 😳😳 I love you Kandee and have for so many years. #1 I want you to be happy and healthy! take as long as you need to grieve and get to where you need to be ♥️
I'm a new subscriber, even though I've watched you plenty of times😊, but I felt that today I just had to subscribe and have more of your videos in my life because after that last message/ last few kind words you said at the end of your video I felt sooo loved!!! Lately I haven't been feeling that way or been around people so loving and positive, so THANK YOU!!!!😘😘You are sooo sooo sweet and I can't wait for what's to come on your channel, and I'm so happy I can be there for all of it!!! Love you and I hope your having a blessed day or even start to your day😇😘😘❤♥😍💞🤗
You are so strong. I have only been a fan for about a year and a half, but in that time I've learned that you are such a fun, sweet, and just generally amazing person. Every video of yours that I've seen has made me laugh and keep going. I'd love a weekly vlog and the 23 and me video. I also want to say that you inspire me and make me want to do better in life.

Good luck in your future endeavors. We (your fans) love you and wish you continued success in whatever you do.

Lots of love,
Bella
Love you babe will always support you❤️ Stay positive. May God continue to bless you and yours🙏🏽
God brought me to your channel , as I did not realize you are a believer. I watched the video when you moved into your home. And I absolutely love Nick.
If you do a weekly blog, you would touch a lot of people who are hurting etc.
They need God.
You could upload a 20 minute video of you folding socks and I’d watch it, but you do you! Upload whatever you want, whenever you want. Do what inspires you, what makes you happy, whatever you feel 🖤 I would love to see vlogs, but like I said; socks work, too 🤷🏻‍♀️😂

I just love you and I pray for you often. Your positivity is contagious. You deserve every happiness. Lots of love! 🖤
We've missed you!!
I'm an internalizer as well, keep everything emotion related close to the chest and under a mask.
Glad you are feeling better, can't wait for more! ❤️
One vlog a week. Makeup tutorials, is what interest me. I am sorry that you were going through personal things. Sometimes that is what one needs to step back and refocus. Thank you for coming back stronger and positive.
Good on you, Kandee.
Love your work, looking forward to seeing more.
Thanks for keeping it real.
Take care.
q;)
Yes do a weekly vlog please! I would love to see that. You're amazing and I'm so glad to see you back. I really missed your videos💕
Bless your kind heart, Kandee. Sending you hugs and love. You have always been one of my favorite people on YouTube. Such a loving and warm soul. I am sorry you had such a hard time, and I admire you for still keeping that beautiful smile on your face. Love never dies, so the love that you have for those that have gone, and the love they had for you will stay in your heart forever. ♥️
Weekly vlog!!!!!!!!
Kandee, I have loved you since I was 12 years old. I think I was your 50th follower (ugly cry!) You have taught me everything I know about makeup, but also most I know about loving people and staying strong. I love you so much!! Thank you for everything and I am praying over you and your family!
Oh Kandee, my heart breaks hearing about your family especially your grandma. My condolences.

Love the celeb transformation videos you've done. Your own too. God bless, Jamie
Kandee, sorry for your loss. your one of the first youtubers I watched. Your videos are inspirational and i think not just me but others too have learned from you over the years With your videos  Thanks truly.  I love your hair maybe a video how to keep it the way you have it but as a do it yourself kind of video. What about how to do your makeup on the cheapest budget but the products ypu use are good for your skin maybe under 20 bucks all the items . I also lost a loved ones and appreciate the memory's I got from them. I'm glad your doing better and found something that helped you threw.

Vlogs
Collabs- collar with Jeffree star!
Get ready with me
Thank you for being that “Internet big sister” who taught so many of us how to do makeup. Since you’ve given me advice all these years, here’s my little nugget that I learned last year that helped me find my passion. 
Do what makes you smile — whatever it is that you’d do if you could do anything you wanted. The most incredible things start happening when you stop overthinking and just do what makes you happy. 
If we’re talking YouTube videos, for me, that meant making pink unicorn popcorn. Literally THAT is what made me realize how much I love creating video and changed my entire life trajectory. 🤣  
I would LOVE to see a vlog from you, but either way, do what brings a smile to your face. Whether that means doing it on camera or not, we’ll all be happier knowing that you’re happy. ☺️💜
You’ve been missed, your motivational videos have helped me so much, god is always with you and using your talents to help more people than you realize, hang in there and never give up, xxxx
You are so strong! Never forget it! 
I want to see skin routine video! 😘 love you
I have followed you for so long.  I'm so sorry for your losses <3 You are being prepared for more greatness in your life and I'm glad that you see these as a time to keep going.  Love you and thanks for sharing!
First you tuber I ever watched! Love you so much ❤️❤️❤️
I’m an OG kandee viewer! Some of my favorite videos were your q&a’s with your fake glasses. Love when you show your true self ❤️
💖I can relate to multiple losses - you are SO loved girl! Thank you for sharing this: we all want you to be happy!
Can't wait to see what's next for you 💖💖watching you for years. Thank you for everything.

Girl take care of you! Brought me to tears about your grandma. My grandma is my best friend❤️ you’re amazing and such a strong positive influence!
Do not stand at my grave and weep 
I am not there. I do not sleep. 
I am a thousand winds that blow. 
I am the diamond glints on snow. 
I am the sunlight on ripened grain. 
I am the gentle autumn rain. 
When you awaken in the morning's hush 
I am the swift uplifting rush 
Of quiet birds in circled flight. 
I am the soft stars that shine at night. 
Do not stand at my grave and cry; 
I am not there. I did not die.

by Mary Elizabeth Frye

Kandee I lost my Me’maw 15 years ago and to be honest it still feels like it was yesterday. When I was struggling the most, I read this poem and it helped me  work through her passing. I just wanted to share it. Much love 💕 ❤️🎀💝
Yes weekly vlog! Sweety I've watched you for years. You were my first 😍 You taught me so much. Not just makeup. But I've seen you change and I know some may think this sounds crazy but I dont care, I pray for you. Especially since your father went to heaven. You are an inspiration and you have such a beautiful soul (& 💖) Be blessed beautiful.
Weekly vlog!! Oh hell yes please. I adore you. You are like my spirit animal.
Makeup for older skin. Maybe do a tutorial for women with hooded eyelids?
😭 how come I always end up crying when we have heart to hearts! Love you Kandee! Thank you for the beautiful energy you put into the world and always having the courage to be yourself!
PLEASE don't ever go away for SO long again!  I felt like I hadn't heard from a BEST friend!  You are a Genuine Love- beautiful & admirable!  You have inspired me during some very 'down' times... thank you for just being you!  Keep Jesus near & please keep sharing your unique tender heart with us! Lotsa' Love! 💕
Hey Kandee I just Wanna see weekly vlog, writing a book is a really great idea! Your so sweet I hope things get better all around for you God Bless ❤
I’ve always love your transformation video that’s what got me watching your channel since 2008. I was getting a little worried but glad your back on YouTube looking forward to your videos. Much love
I have been watching since you were pregnant and going into labor. I adore you. Thank you for coming back and sharing this video! You've been missed!
Been watching you since the first year you got on YouTube I literally grew up with you thanks for being unique original and loving ❤️ I love you Kandee
Kandee, your videos have been inspirational to me for years! In some of my darkest days I could listen to you and feel better. Thank you for being sweet, kind, amazing you! Love you!
she did look terrific! what a wonderful woman, I hope I have a positive attitude like that up to the very last moments of life. Praying for you and your family Kandee, xo.
You are a beautiful, motivating, and honest young woman. I was very happy to see you uploaded a video. Prayers, hugs, and blessings...MaryEllen
Kandee you're one of my favorite youtubers. I have watched you pretty much since day 1 and I'm so glad you're back making more videos because I've missed your awesome spirit!
Dont EVER quit, watched you pretty much since day 1! still a firm fave xxx
Weekly vlogs- YES! 
I could totally see you writing a book! You're such an encouraging, brave & wonderful woman and I think you have so much inspiration stuff to put out into the world xo
<3 you were the first beauty guru I ever found on here and I have missed your videos. Thank you for sharing your tips and kindness and life with us all over the years.
Kandee, I started watching you videos when you began 10 years ago. I was in a pretty low and lonely place myself and you and your videos honestly were the key to picking me back up and finding myself. I owe you so much you have no idea! Your such an empowering beautiful strong woman. My true inspiration. It breaks my heart seeing you go through such loss and heartache. I would absolutely LOVE if you were to write a book! Stay strong and remember how incredible YOU are! All my love xxx
Hi Kandee,  sorry for all your tough times and personal endeavors.   Your beautiful family will always be with you and are very proud of you.  Your original video intentions - beauty is great BUT your graciousness and love are extremely inspirational.   Please feel better and drop a line when you are in NY again - there is a hug waiting for you!
Thank you for sharing your very personal difficulties with us.  It was tough but I hope you know how you are appreciated and thought of (it's nice to have people concerned)
See you when you are ready!!!!
I lost my grandmother almost 2 years ago now, and my heart hurts for you to go through all this loss in such a small time. My grams was my positive light (I'm a pessimistic person most of the time)  and she always challenged me to do better and live better and just without her has been so hard. No joke. But I love you, and I hope that you know how much I look up to you. 

Congrats on the Too Faced launch, I would love to see just more of you. I legit have no idea, I just want more videos. You could sing Broadway showtunes in no makeup in a hurricane and I would watch it. Love you, stay beautiful.
You inspire me! Love inspirational chats from you 💕 yes to the book!!
I’ve really missed you!  So sorry for all your recent losses. Glad to hear you are feeling ready to start making videos again!  I love the idea of some challenges and a weekly vlog. 💕
It's sad that lovely youtubers are fading why the basket of deplorables rise to the top. And they don't even have the talent that you do. I saw you and Laura Lee on the today show doing a makeup challenge and their was no comparison.  And...no comparison in character either. Best wishes on your future endeavors.
I am glad things are balancing for you!
I would love to see a weekly vlog.
Love to you and yours!
<3
I've been watching your videos since the way beginning. I've watched some videos so many times I could quote them!! I'd watch your videos when my family life was hard and I was alone and I knew I could count on you to say something warm and loving to me. I always came back to your channel because you were so different than any other person I've watched, and I don't even wear makeup! Haha I just loved watching you being yourself, and how positive you were. I, too, believe in the power of kindness and love and uplifting people and trying to spread good in the world. We all love you here Kandee, we love seeing you happy!  PS. I'd love to see your 23&me video!! 😊

Much love! ❤❤
So happy to see you back!! Love coming to your channel nothing but good vibes. Love all your videos 💕Would love to see weekly vlogs. That would be amazing ! 😊 xoxo
My stepfather died and I had to collect his things from the hospital....my ::son:: died and I had to clean out his apartment, my aunt died and I saw her take her last breath...all of this in 2 years.  You're not alone with being hit broadside and feeling like you're floundering.  Good that you want to move forward...
Kandee, I just love you. You are such a sweetheart. I’m so sorry for your losses. May God Bless you and your family. I look forward to what ever you bring to us in the future. We’ll all be waiting 💟
Love you Kandee. I have been watching you since very early on. And have always been a silent supporter sending my love through the world to you. But it would be nice to see you in weekly vlogs so then I can keep an eye on you  making sure you are alright. The strange thing about YT is that you feel like you're friends and you know the person having never actually spoken to one another. I wanna see vlogs, inspirational things. Maybe check out Arel from the band Icon For Hire. Her channel is full of inspirational talks.  I wanna see tutorials and you doing what you do best. Being happy and having the best time you can. 
Lots of hugs from my house to yours. 
Amy. Xxxxxxxxxxxxx
I would like to know your skincare routine because you look like you don't age. Maybe you could include your mom because she also looks absolutely fabulous!
Bless Your Little Heart, Sweetheart!
I love the best products!
$$$$ products vs $ products
You are an awesome person, do not let stress make you sick 🍭💕. Keep being you!!!
HOLY MOLY!! YOUR STUNNING!!! LOVE YOU
I love the way you use your platform. You are such a great role model and truly a genuine person. I have been watching your videos for years, and learned most of what  I know about beauty from you and Michelle Phan! Thank you for putting so much effort and love into all that you do. 😘

You're just a cosmic empath on a higher vibe, trapped in the LA matrix.
I've been watching you since the beginning. You've got a heart of gold and you're inspiring in more ways than one. I smile every time I watch your videos! I would love to see more collabs, good ole hauls and empties. And just remember ...You're more beautiful than you know, more talented than you think, and more loved than you can imagine. Hugs from this girl Lo! 🤗😘

You are a really inspirational and sweet ,sweet caring soul. I just recently starting watching some of your videos and I really appreciate all of the messages you give in your videos. It really shows what a very sincere person you are. Also, just losing one important person in your life is a HUGE Loss,so losing four people is a very painful process. Thank you for being you,and for all the knowledge you share.

Weekly vlogs is awsom!! Love u so much Kandee!! Ur amazing!!
Thank you for your inspiration! You were one of the first makeup artists I subscribed to! Go LIVE your life girlie!
Love this!! I always like more personal or vlog type videos (I know, the exact opposite of what you just said 😂), and I LOVE your fashion videos, or makeup for the everyday mom/person. I, personally, don’t care for celebrity makeover videos... don’t why, I just don’t. I love anything that is more “real” I guess... something that I, as a mom who loves fashion and makeup, could relate to... does that make sense?
Hi Kandee,
Just wanna say, I know what you're going through. I lost both of my parents in the last year. First my mom end of november and 6 weeks later my dad suddenly died.
Big hug from the Netherlands...

Oh, and maybe it's an idea to do a video with Nikkie Tutorial?
Kandee you're beautiful inside & out 💓✨
Yes!! Do a weekly vlog! I can't just have Kandee disappear completely! I love you!
Oh Kandee.. you are so amazing. You’ve been my inspiration since you uploaded your first video! When I first subscribed to you, you probably had about 300+ subscribers... not kidding you!!
Ever since then I always looked forward to your videos. And I follow you on IG, FB and as a FB friend because every post you put up just makes my day!!!
I first met you at IMATS here in Toronto and it was just sooo awesome to get hugs from you. I even met your mom there! I actually went just to see you there!
Honestly, you can create whatever video you want and I am sure you will get sooo much support. 
Maybe a few suggestions that I have though is maybe some “go-to” mommy looks??? Ha ha, especially for us with toddlers that don’t have enough time to get ready sometimes. 
Also, i’ll be one of those people watching your weekly vlogs!!! 🙋🏽‍♀️ i remember when you used to post blogs about your family in your kandeeland blog!! (Gaaah why do I sound like a stalker.. ha ha ha but I promise to you I’m not. Just a huge fan of you and Tiff because you guys are such great role models who always spread positivity! We need more people like you.)
Love you, Kandee!🌟💖 love & prayers!
You taught me how to contour the right way 😗 thank you for that...i now know how to contour my nose "button up" and suddenly, im loving my nose hehe!!! 💙
You look like an Angel.  You will always be a part of my life.  Youve helped me so much in the past 9-10 years   I O U. xoxo
Much Love to you Kandee! You are always a positive inspiration and such a sweetheart. Take care of your self and that little (BIG) heart so you can continue to share your joy. Sending love and positive vibes your way!!
I’ve followed you for years! It’s not YouTube without you. Please stick around!
Weekly vlog❤ i love seeing your beautiful soul shine in this world
You’re amazing ❤️ love you kandee 
Would love weekly vlogs ❤️
Kandee, I admire you so much!  Thank you for sharing and being such a bright light.
I loved this video. I can relate so much.
You are such a wonderful person. And yes, I totally teared up during this video. Sending virtual hugs and positive vibes.

Thank you for all the wonderful videos over the years! You are beautiful inside and out! I love your make up tricks videos! Perfecting makeup looks!
You’re such a beautiful person inside and out ❤️
Hey Kandee, I normally don't comment on videos, but now I need to. I have started watching your videos years ago. I loved that I found a dark haired beauty guru and your videos taught me so much. You are the reason I know how to make my eyes look pretty and don't run around looking like a clown. Thank you! 😍
You are such a beautiful and kind person. Life changes, jobs change and the circumstances change. I'm very sure and confident you'll find your way through these changes. 
Sending love and hugs! 🤗
You have always been such a genuine and positive person. Do what makes you happy and know that your fans will support you in whatever you decide. ❤️
I've followed you for about 7 years.  And there was a video you did on motivation and positivity. That video helped me in so many ways. I've watched it more than a few times. Your videos have brought me hope, joy, and reminded me to love myself. Thank you for helping me come out of my depression. You are in my prayers, Kandee. 💓💓💓
You taught me how to fill in my eyebrows when I was 20 years old... I'm 30 now. I love you, girl. Thank you for the light that you shine on this world. God bless you!
I am against religions, but i love you.


Sorry for my english
When it comes to Christmas time, PLEAAAAASE DO ANOTHER HOUSE TOUR! I CRAVE THEM SO MUCH
You were the first ytber I followed. Kandee you have taught me so much,not just in makeup but you have been an inspiration to me. When my dad died 2 years ago I went and watched your video again, and it meant so much to me. Your video helped me get through my loss.  I love you and always looks forward to anything you upload.  Thank you for being a kind, genuine loving person.  Xoxo

One of the first I ever watched. Love you Kandee! 💞
I’m so sorry for all your losses.❤️😢 I will watch any video you upload. I just love your positivity & how inspirational you are.

Thank you for sharing everything you said spoke to my heart. the video of your Grandma was so sweet and brought tears to my eyes, thinking of my Grandma who also passed. 🤗❣️
Collabs with other make up artists and makeup looks with one brand. 

Love you so much Kandee!! You were the first YouTube artist that I followed and you’re the reason I got so involved with makeup 💕💕 Thank you!!!!
I'm sorry to hear of all your losses.  You're a beautiful person inside & out.  Praying for good health & sending lots of love your way.

Also would like diy and home decore videos from you :)
Kandee, I am so sorry for Your losses. I didn't know about Your Grandma! She was such a Dear Soul. I LOVED seeing YOU and Your Grandma together. It was so Sweet and Wonderful to see. Whatever YOU should decide to do on You Tube, I know YOU will do something very Special, because YOU are a very Special Young Lady! God Bless YOU and May he give YOU comfort and Joy as YOU continue to go through Life's journey.  Thank YOU for being YOU. YOU are a very Sweet Lady. Praying for YOU!
There are so many people sending you love and prayers. I never comment to on videos, but I just lost my Nana, and I loved her so very much. Seeing your videos of you and you’re grandmother reminded me of my nana. Thank you 🙏🏽❤️

Kandee, your one of the few beauty influencers that is transparent and with the biggest heart. I don’t imagine YouTube without you. I wanna cry just thinking the possibility.
I’d love for you to do more “ BEAUTY SECRETS “ videos!!! Please🙏🏼
I don’t usually watch your vids Kandee but this video touched my heart! Loss is so hard. Thank you for taking time for yourself. Remember you always deserve it!
Thank you for sharing- I will keep you in my prayers, losing a loved one is never easy. Vlog would be fun. Always love your transformations! And makeup tips!
I love you Kandee!!! Your videos always make me smile 😊 your such a sweet person!! I want to see weekly vlogs and challenges 😃

I’ve been watching you since you started, before millions of people even knew your name and I’m so grateful for how far you’ve come. 💖 Praying that Jesus continues to guide you. 🤗
Stay strong Kandee 💕 Such a beautiful soul inside and out!
You have inspired me in so many ways ; my very first Youtuber.  Thank you ❤️
Your grandma's positivity while sick made me take a minute to give thanks for everything I have and everyone I love. Heaven will enjoy having her and keeping her safe and sound until you can meet her again some day. 💕
Just sit down videos, cooking, family vlogs, and makeup tutorials 😊
You are cute and sweet and genuine (and talented!) You do what feels right for you...aka 'you do YOU'. Best wishes!!
I’m so sorry for your losses. Praying for you all. 🙏. You are such an inspiration to us all. I love your videos and I think you’re amazing! God bless you!
I started my channel 8 years ago and you were one of the first people I subscribed to. I absolutely adore you! ♡
I want to see a Kandee clothing line! 🙌🏻
Weekly Vlog Girl Yesss!!!!  I AM SO Sorry about your grandmother...as I was so close with mine and she was my rock and honestly when I lost my Gran I just felt as though I died a bit that day...and I have truly learned so much about myself since then...I look forward to the day that we see one another again...its not going to be anytime soon but it will be one day....my heart hurts a bit for you...sending you the biggest hugs!!! Xx
I've been watching you for years...love anything you'd do..love ya!!!
Dear Kandee, I still remember the day I felt so depressed that I thought about ending it all and searching for something or someone who can change my mind. I clicked on your video "5 ways to keep going" and I've followed you ever since. I have your inspirational videos in my phone in case I ever need an inspiration and motivation on a go and I can't be enough thankful for that! Your words and shining generous personality always brings me back to my senses and help me to keep going. I wish you only the best and all happiness in the world and I can't wait for your new videos and new accomplishments as well as success! Love you!
Sorry you have such a hard year. I think you should collab with Swoop. I've seen you two together at GenB and NYX FaceAwards and you seem really fun together. Blessings.
I’ve always loved your videos and your energy. You are a beautiful and kind.
I lost my Grandmother in January of this year. It was one of the most difficult times I’ve ever went through.     My life just won’t be the same without her.  I am so inspired by your strength and how you navigate the trials this life brings.  Been watching your channel for years, I love your heart!  I’m looking forward to seeing what you do next.  ❤️
You are such a beautiful soul. I love you and your videos.
you'll always be loved 😍😻❤️💛💕💘
You are also the first youtuber I started watching so many years ago as well. Probably since when you first started. For that reason, you'll always be my number one.  Hugs to you, Kandee.
Kandee, Sweetie, Queen, Iam very very sorry for your enormously loss....;((( but...this is life! We come and we go....one thing is very important to youuuuuuu: you have to know that they live on..but in a different dimension!! They all are your angels now..they know everything you do, think, want, desire, etc.......watch Paranormal investigators here in youtube...or: Buscadores de Almas(Spanish)..it means soul searcher..but I think you understand:))) this helped me a lot to understand this special dimension! Called: ORBS-...this will calm you a looooot. Trust me, this is an amazing knowledge! You look beautiful:)) Love you, stay strong Cutiepie:))besiiiitos
It’s about time.  I’ve been wanting you to get real and be honest about the good AND the bad.  I’ve followed you for most of those ten years and see how deflated your usually chipper self has been.  A positive attitude is one thing but the reality that sometimes life hurts and drags us down.  If I see a trend in YouTube lately, it’s not to know everything but for things that are shared to be real.  Kudos Kandee and ... single is awesome too ;)
Beautiful love you 😍 such a kind seeet beautiful girl I inside and outside
I would love to see a weekly blog. Yes, this would be a great way to keep up with trends and give you a continued platform. blog!!!!!
You are the first person I ever started watching on YouTube, and I have always enjoyed watching your videos. Whatever you choose to upload is fine by me, I think all of your subscribers want you to do stuff you enjoy.
No one can be strong all the time. Confide in someone even if just a personal journal for your eyes only. Your blood pressure needs the release, girlfriend! Sending you much love 💕
The sky is the limit for you!!! I love 💗 you so much too!!!! It we so good to hear that you are staying on YouTube. You got me interested into YouTube. You are my #1 friend. Over the years you have gotten me through a lot in my life. Don’t let God stop using you! 

Which that being said the bad things you are keeping close to your heart could be a physical reaction on your heart. I know you are probably trying to give them to God but you need to let them go. I as fan totally understood the time you needed or take off as well. 

Know as far as what I think you should do is: 
*what is up with all the these new eyebrow products
*have your hairstylist come on and give us tips on your hair
*behind the scenes of shows that you are doing (of course after it aires and you have permission)

That is all I can think of now 😊
Huge hugs from my house to yours 😘
We love you so much, Kandee. I've been "around" for so long, you influenced me in the best way possible. All the best to you. All our love to you and your fam.
We are all so sorry for your losses! Take your time... You're worth the wait! Sending you my love! ❤️❤️❤️
Sorry the twist and turns you went through this year.  I’m glad you did want you needed to do for yourself. I completely understand.  
With that said. I’m glad to see a video!  And if love a weekly Vlog!!!!
Que chula your grandma!!! What a blessing to have her as long as you did ❤️
Weekly vlogs would be great. Sending you hugs and kisses from London xoxo
Yes vlogs!!!!! Any video from you would be beautiful. You’re the most beautiful soul I’ve seen anywhere and we could all use more of that positivity spreading around. 💖✨
Thank you for being so honest & so pure!! We are all human...this video just makes you so much more amazing!! Take as much time as you need...take care of YOU first!!! All of your loving loyal subscribers will be here no matter what 😘
You are simply AWESOME!😘❤️❤️❤️

Omgeeee Kandee seeing you and your grandma made me cry. I SO relate. You inspire me.

Almost 10 years ago, I was looking for make-up tutorials on YouTube and I came across your first vídeos.. you helped me so much, thank you for all your kindness!! And never quit YouTube .. we miss you!! Love from Portugal 💖💖😘😘

I’ve been watching you for years and you’ve always been your authentic self and I appreciate you for that. The blond hair is stunning on you. All the best with everything. Follow your heart ♥️
I've been watching your videos since I first found my love of makeup.  Back then Iwas an unhappy person but loved those who were positive and happy.  Today I am happy, positive and love life and I'm so grateful for you!❤
Love you Kandee. I started watching you when I was 18 and you inspired me to a makeup artist.  I love watching your videos but you have to was best for you. But I hope u don't stop YouTube. I would love to see a weekly blog!
Please no hauls or challenges.. love your transformations and tutorials.
Kandee... could you BE any sweeter <3 Thank you for being a kind bright light.

I remember finding you 7 years ago and i feel in love with your energy and your art! you're one of a kind and have helped me through so much stuff and i thank you!
Thank you for being you and putting so much positivity out there :)
Followed you since waaayyyy back and loved your energy and quick tips. You’re awesome for sharing everything you know and have learned. Big hugs 🤗
That video with your grandmother made me cry. That was so so so beautiful. What a lovely soul you BOTH have.
What about the Lisa Frank that you endorsed?
I was at your make-up bootcamp in NYC, best time ever and you are amazing! We want more tutorials please :)
Don't leave Kandee, I love you so much and your videos 😍❤😭
Weekly vlog would be cool...bless you
Kandee - you're a messenger of love, hope, positivity and possibility. Thank you for being you! Love and hugs!!!
I am always so inspired by you Kandee!!! So much love for you 💖
DO A WEEKLY VLOG!!
Pleeeease do weekly vlogs!! Also I love you I hope you’re doing well, you’re in my ❤️
I lost my dad, grandma and grandpa in 5 years.  DO NOT FEEL GUILTY for taking time off.  GO - do whatever is going to make your mental health better.  Your true youtube fans will wait.  May God bless 💖 you & give you strength.
I loved your grandma 😂😭❤💔
Good job and good energy you are so real
Much love & positive energy to you Kandee, you're a really special person. That's easy to see in you! 😊
))))you are getting stronger every day(((
Weekly vlogs would be epic!!
You were the VERY first YouTuber I ever watched!!
Yes weekly vlogs !! Please!!
I'm so glad I found your YouTube account! Both you and your subscribers create such a positive and encouraging environment on your channel.
Kandee, you are the original.  Keep it going.  I love your vids so much.  Honestly, humility, beauty, love.
do the weekly vlogs! hope you’re doing well x
You are amazing and yes I would love to see a daily vlog.
You are one of the first people I ever watched!!! So much to you Kandee, nothing but love and support for you and wishing you all the best!!! 💕
I've missed you! Love you Kandee💕
You should do a collaboration with Shane Dawson. Seems  like all the long-term youtubers hit walls at times and he's good at helping people get back on track.
Oh my goodness!! Kandee I was soooo incredibly happy and excited to see you after so long. I am such a big fan of yours!! Your videos are awesome, inspiring and they honestly have touched my soul and heart in so many ways that I cannot even begin to tell you. I hope the rest of 2018, what's left of it at least lol, brings you nothing but happiness and joy. I cannot wait to see what's in store for us in your next video. I hope to one day be able to meet you because you are my idol and inspiration. Lots of love and support from my heart and home here in Arizona 💕💕
Hi sweet girl! I remember loving your very first videos - your lil accessory diys! That chain nautical necklace thingieee and i think you had a denim distressing diy too. Stuff like that!
Wow ..that was nice. Thank you Kandee for your warm hugs and love. Also thanks for sharing everything that you did, it's not easy I must say when someone passes away. I've had my brother pass away like 13 years ago, my grandma about 6 and grandfather two years ago. And I understand when you say that your brain just like taps away (something like that), cause it's hard and sometimes it's just a lot to take in..
Well I'm here if you need some love and inspiration back. Lots of xoxo❤❤ 😘😘 ☺
So glad to see you back, so sorry that you have lost these family members. They will be watching over you & protecting you xx
Thank you for your encouraging words. I am a new subscriber and almost didn't click on this video bc I have school tomorrow and need sleep lol but I needed to hear this. I lost my grandma three weeks ago as well and it's been the hardest time of my life. But hang in there girl! Not sure if you're religious, but if you are, GOD'S GOT YOU! 💓🙏
I have to tell you something. When you described your grandmother I thought you were talking about you. You are exactly like her. Kind hearted, caring, positive and you have the biggest heart. Just like your grandmother ❤

Kandee,
I started watching you years ago- you are genuine! You gave me confidence as a single mom who just let herself go. I would spend hours watching and rewatching all your videos and attempting to recreate your looks. Thank you for being you don’t hide your light or let anyone try to dim it.
I love you kandee!!  Keep your beautiful spirit because you add to this thing called life and if keeps me hopeful that there are good people in this world!! Xoxo

I am sooooo thankful that you're on this earth with all of us. You are such an inspiration, and you bring so much love and comfort to the world. Love you, beautiful. 💕 Nothing would be the same without you.

A beautiful person inside out ❤️
Girl, hire yourself a vide editor! Love ya
You are the first YouTuber I ever started watching. You taught me so much of what I know about beauty---both inner and outer--so your channel will always be special to me. Thanks for opening up and I hope to see you making videos again soon! xoxo <333
He gives and takes away... You are so loved kandee ❤ don't worry about the pressures of followers, remember that you follow HIM. Xoxo
I want to see anything positive!!! There isn't a lot of that in my life, so I love to see it. ❤😚

Weekly vlog please!! ❤️ love you kandee
You are so beautiful inside and out. Love u so much and would  love to see weekly vlogs.
i just like seeing you in your video, i like vlogs, your favorites, things you like
more skincare please! :)
You are so beautiful! I’ve watched you from the beginning! I’d love to see vlogs ! Xx
Awww. Your sweet grandma..You were the first Youtuber I watched way back. I'm 52 and still love to watch. And I still wear the same makeup lol. Take good care hun.
You’re the transformation queen! SO impressive & entertaining! And I LOVE your collabs! Seeing you interact with others is so fun. You have one of the warmest, most genuine personalities on YouTube. Looking forward to Kandee 10.0 😄
Don’t quit YouTube! You’re so amazing such a sweet person!!! God bless you!!
I miss you !!! You are the first youtuber that I watch (cutting tshirts) I like to see you more collabs and more down to earth makeup.
I love you! Vlog vlog vlog, yussssss 💕💕 but only if it's working for you. I'd love to see a snippet in to your weekly life, but I don't want you to feel pressured in to doing something you don't truly want to do.
Kandee you are so positive and I’ve always loved watching your videos the past 8 years! I have missed seeing you on here!
The world needs to see more Kandee!! Yes to the weekly vlogs!! ❤️
You are indeed very wise. Thanks for coming back to YT. Missed you. I vote for hair transformations (is that makeup?)
I love you so much. You are the most positive person on youtube. God bless you and your family.
I’m not even that into makeup but I follow you bc I just love your personality and what you put off into the world. I would love to just see some random videos that you have fun making. Halloween is right around the corner so I’m sure we’ll see some awesome transformation videos! I love the idea of you doing a video with Shane. I feel like you could really talk about some deep emotional sh*t but put such a positive light on it and help so many people.
This makes me so happy!! I have missed your videos, you are the first beauty Youtuber I ever watched many years ago! You are so amazing! ❤️❤️❤️
As a guy who doesn't use makeup, I came to your channel about 9 years ago towards your beginning and it was for your cheerful attitude, uplifting words, positive demeanor, and caring soul. Aside from some of the skincare videos, I enjoyed your vlogs and collabs the most when you were having fun and bringing us into other aspects of your life. 

Would love to see videos that continue to explore your other hobbies or things you're learning outside of makeup as well. Perhaps some of the kinds of workouts you've been doing by yourself or with some friends. Games. Combining some of your transformations to make some mini movies or skits as I find you and the people around you hilarious! :) 

Whatever you decide to do, I'll forever continue to support you.
Hugs Kandee! You were the first YouTuber I watched. I will always adore you. Take the time you need and do what's best for you 💜
you have such a kind heart
Literally you are the reason I got into finally doing make up, finally being confident to do bold eyeshadows being a girl with glasses.
Kandee I’m so glad you’re not quitting YouTube!
You were the First YouTube tutorial I’ve ever watched!!! It was princess Jasmine tutorial and I will never forget it 😊My daughter got so many compliments that Halloween and now she’s almost 18😳...Lol
But anyway I usually never comment but you’re a beautiful soul and I just wanted to let you know that you are loved 💝 
😘 XoXo 🤗
I definitely want to see a daily blog. God bless you babes.
So sad for your loss, I didn’t know you had MEXICAN blood in you!!! May eternal light shine upon your grandma and may she Rest In Peace. 🙏
so happy your back! sorry for all your loss
I would love to see more make up transformations
As someone who has been though a lot of shit, I want to share a lesson I learned.  No one has it worse than you, because no one else is you.  This also means no one has it easier than you either, because their hard is their hard.  Your hard is your hard.  It’s okay to say it’s hard.  It’s okay for it to be so hard you can’t handle it sometimes. 

And off that lesson, don’t beat yourself up because it’s “not as bad as...” or “others have it worse...” because you aren’t them.  You are you.

Just with knowing that, remember to be kind and empethatic.  Because everyone is fighting their own battles that you don’t know
Yes for the weekly vlog! kandee, I'm so sorry you've had to experience so much loss this year. The main thing you need to do is do what's best for you. You truly are an inspiration to so many. Love you so much!
You have always been my favorite beauty YouTuber Kandee. I’ve been watching your videos for so long.  I love you.  You are so kind and genuine. I would love to see the weekly vlog Kandee!
Whoever disliked this has no heart

It doesn't matter what you record because you're are ALWAYS inspiring with your positive outlook, even when you're feeling blue !!!
 * * * come back to us dear Kandee ~ we love you so very much !!!  * * *
I am so sorry for all your hard times! You are truly amazing and I am so thankful that I could have been along your journey for so many years! You have been an incredible inspiration and uplifting for me! Just thank you for all of that!
Oh my heart. Kandee, you are truly such an inspiration. I know I've said that so many times to you, but god knows how much I mean those words. You are always so upbeat, positive, and loving..even in your hard times. I just love who you are. I'm praying so much for you..no specific reason..just because I love you. ❤
Idk what tags are going around but collabs would definitely be fun!
Do a house tour now that it’s decorated! Love you kandee❤️
I've always enjoyed your favourites videos but I'd love to see more collabs, weekly (or even monthly) vlogs, and even regular makeup tutorials
LOVE you so much Kandee ❤️
You were the first mua on youtube I ever found. You paved the way. Keep going as you don't know where the road goes.
I've been looking for you Kandee! Love you always momshie!
Kandee, we love you so much!! The best thing about your vlogs was escaping our own realities and living, laughing and smiling with your realities. That being said, I would love you to return to vlogging even mundane grocery shopping is endearing to watch. You have such a beautiful heart and it is fun to watch you opening products or spending time with family. Of course your beauty tutorials are always helpful as well. I’m glad you are healing and at a place where you can be excited again about filming, we’ve missed you!
Kandee I love you so much your positivity has encouraged me in times when I was feeling really down, I've been following you since the beginning I usually don't comment on videos or on Instagram but you just make me smile I too keep internalizing some things and have gone thru the high blood pressure and stuff has been sad this last year with some loss but I keep pushing thru and your beautiful smile makes me smile, wish I could give you a giant hug right now and as far as youtube videos do what makes you happy I wouldn't mind some weekly vlogging as well, thanks for all the kind words you have for us while you might be going thru rough times I truly appreciate and love you and your beautiful heart😍
You look different. Maybe its just been a while. I miss when YouTube was fun and loving. All those new kids messing up and acting awful need to go away. Thanks for always being real. You were one of the first YouTubers I fell in love with.  You look incredible .
I first discovered your channel when you were pregnant with Ellie.. it was in the fall, and I wanted to how to create a smokey eye and I found your Kim K video.. it was the first video of yours that I watched and you were the first youtuber I subscribed to.. I don't remember the first video i saw of any other youtuber that I've subscribed to since, you have been the only one who made such a huge impression on me.. you were the one who taught me how to do my makeup and you made me fell beautiful.. I've laughed and I've cried with and for you.. you gave me courage to cut my hair short..

One of my favourite videos, is on your good old vlog channel, with Ellie on your arm, your showing what you just bought at the grocery store, and for some reason , it made me feel at home whenever I've watched it..

What video style would I love to see?? I want to see things that makes  you happy, things that inspire and love.. the more passionate you are, the better 😙😙😙
I would love vlogs! Sending hugs❤
Thank you for being you. All I can say, it's been a pleasure
You are literally the first YouTuber I had ever followed . I remember it was your chola tutorial that got me lol loved it .
Yes! Vlogs would be great but I will watch anything you put out!  Been loyal from the very beginning!  I still tear up when I hear you say your mantra at the end!
You are so amazing Kandee. You’re so beautiful inside and out and a true blessing. No matter if you make videos or not I will always being cheering for you.
Weekly vlogs would be so wonderful. Dearest Kandee, your lil heart isn’t so lil. Your beautiful heart beats so hard because God has given you the amazing  gift of helping others find the love and light within their own. I thank you for helping me find mine.❤️
Love you kandee. I would love thrift vlogs, challenges, doing other people's makeup, etc.
Youtube needs Kandee.  May the Lord bless and keep you and yours always. I pray a physical and emotional healing to your heart.  May the Lord guide and guard you everywhere you go.
Kandee you inspire me. One time in a video you described having your own style because YOU love it. I hear your voice in my head when I wear more ... unique outfits and hairstyles. You have helped me perfect my own personal contouring and you give me immense hope. You are very positive and wise. I feel the hugs you send and I send you a big hug back.

I am sorry for all of your losses. I know that through this loss you will find the beauty and you will share that beauty with others. In this way those you lost will not truly be lost, but their deaths will lead to more positivity in the world. You are a pure conduit of love. Thank you.

I like your tips and tricks videos and the videos where you show your look you are actually doing in daily life. But let's be honest I will watch whatever you put up. I love you and am so proud of you.
When I saw the title I was super scared to watch but I’m so glad you’re not leaving YouTube! I’ve watched your videos for years and some of them have gotten me through some very rough times. The positivity messages throughout your videos are so uplifting. As a suggestion for future content, it would be awesome to see some videos just about that, how to keep your head up and get through hard times, wellness, your favourite books etc. That would be really awesome to watch. Otherwise, I’ve been watching you for six years - your videos already rock, so keep that up 😁 sending you tons of positivity and good vibes for the future xx
we want you to film what ever makes YOU happy, whatever's fun for you - is fun for us. your happiness radiates! I just love you. you're drama free, you're never inappropriate, etc., etc. just go back to the basics. I love learning and you love teaching...
DEFINITELY WANT WEEKLY VLOGS
Praying for you💛

I love watching PR unboxing and makeup halls! I would also love to see collabs with Tati and Nikki!!!!!!! Its so nice that I can let my 10 and 11 year old daughters watch you without worry that you will say anything inappropriate! For that I thank you! Maybe one day you will do a collab with them as they are becoming sensational MUA's!
I know you keep using the words “little heart” and I hope you realize you have a HUGE heart. You’re a blessing to everyone watching. With all of the loss and negative energy in the world, it’s nice to escape that every once and awhile with one of your videos. Keep shining Kandee💕
So glad to hear from you Kandee! So very sorry with all you went through.. I missed you! I think "Home Decorating" would be great! Thank You Kandee Take care Hugs <3
Yes to the weekly vlogs Kandee amd also the DNA video that would be so awesome to see. 😄
You were one of the first people i followed on YT you were amazing i loved your energy and positive vibes. One of the sweetedt ppl whom i never heard bad media about. Sending well wishes and hope to see your face soon. And yes to the weekly vlogs!
You were the first you tuber I ever subscribed to!! And I was hooked!! Literally became obsessed with your videos. It was either 2010 or 2011. And I’ve loved you ever since. There’s times I go through things in life & ask myself “What would Kandee do?”  I still go back & watch your old videos & vlogs often. You just put me in a better place! Hugs and love to you Kandee!💖
I can't believe it's been 10years. I remember the time you were filming with a white background with lights 😁 I was so jealous because I also wanted to make vids on youtube but like you said back then it was something unknown. I really like you and your vids. You're an inspiration to a lot of people. 💜
You were my #1 beauty girl I’d watched with the lemon face scrub back in the day and that’s been years, I’m so happy you’re still going strong 💪 despite the hardships. Your love radiates far and deep within our hearts 💕
First YouTuber i followed!!! Will follow wherever you go!
@kandeejohnson I know I'm a bit late watching this video and dont know if you will see this comment but I just wanted to say thank you for making this video! I have been a follower for a couple years now, which started after my back surgeries and your videos caught my eye (and I have been a huge fan since) and myself as many other of your followers have been going through alot  and you are one of my inspirations to make it through to the other side. I started my own (very small) channel just as an outlet to do something fun for myself and have been dormant for awhile now as I graduate college after a long road as a single mom accomplishing something I never thought I would, your words are so uplifting and inspirational as always and inspire me to continue pushing forward in things that make me happy. I am so glad you have your flame re-lit and I cant wait to see what you bring us!!! I wish you the best and love you bunches. "huuuuge hugs from my house to yours" Your the best!!!
I love the way you handle events in your life it has helped me since I was in high school till now that im older. I hope you are great and keep on being strong
Voting for weekly vlog, inspiring book, and SKINCARE ROUTINE!! <3
Loved this video from the heart. Been watching your videos forever now. I still remember the lemon for your skin and the 5minute whitening paste. Sending you lots of love, I’m am very sorry for your losses.    Ideas for videos: inspirational, heartwarming and educational. Which you already do. Thank you xoxo
Lovvveeee all your content! For sure collabs, challenges, and updated makeup routines and techniques you’re using!!
This is the first video I've ever watched on your channel. I see your name on Instagram all over other beauty gurus posts and YOU ARE ALWAYS SO SWEET. Every comment is so supportive and kind. I had to come on your most recent video and commend you for your kindness. You genuinely have such a beautiful heart and I'm so sorry to hear about your year thus far being hard on you. Wish you all the best! 🌼🌼🌼
Yes for weekly vlogs IF you wanna make them! I don't want you to feel pressured, but encouraged. I honestly just wanna see videos about your life, what you do, what you like... 
All the best to you! Remember to think of yourself.
You are an inspiration to all of us.  U are a genuine sweet person that always send positivity and keeps our life
<3 my heart aches for all the loss you've had recently. I lost my mom a year and a half ago and it still hurts like it was yesterday sometimes. Bless u and there is no need to apologize for your absence. take all the time u need...
Can you do Halloween makeup for x amount of days in September/October? I love your makeup transformations! You are so talented
Missed you Kandee! I would love to see weekly VLOGS from you. My condolences for your loss
I just found you today. You are simply beautiful. My condolences to you.
I’ve missed you and adore you. Would watch anything you post but understand it’s hard to film, edit and put yourself out there. Love your big heart. Do what’s best for you 💕💕💕
We love you!!! Take your time! I would love weekly vlogs
Weekly vlogs for sure! 🙌🏻
You do you, Boo.

Loving the Gwen Stefani vibes I'm getting from your look today.
Soooo happy you aren’t quitting! You are such an inspiration to soooo many beautiful people! You are the first YouTuber I ever watched YEAAAARSSSS ago and have been obsessed with you ever since! Thank you for being unapologetically you! 💗💗💗
Aww dear one, I've been a subscriber for years but just saw this - lady - you bring such joy to so so many people. Your talent your wit I adore you! Yes we all have loss but it's very painful and unique when it is your own. God bless you. Peace and strength be thine!!  I've been in a period of loss (My best friend my Dad passed away and one month later the end of my 25 year marriage and theres more but thats enough) that put me in a very scary dark place. I work every day as its a real struggle to go on, sharing  your truth with us is helpful believe it or not.  Bless you beautiful one praying for both of us!  You are amazing!
Stay strong lovely. Sending tons of love and well wishes your way!
Weekly blogs please!!! I have been watching your videos since 2010 and I know you post a lot on Instagram but I love watching longer videos on YouTube that you post and it makes my day when I see that you have posted on here!!
I am so proud of you.
Blonde looks amazing on you
Yes weekly vlog
Love you! 💜
Work with glam and gore!!!!!!
I’d love to see a sense of self video like Ingrid Nielsen did. Or what you eat in a day. Just more lifestyle stuff? I love your makeup videos but I also wanna know about kandee 💕✨
Literally love you and I met you during my road to recovery with post partum and let me just tell you.. you literally made my day better!
I would totally watch a weekly vlog! I love your energy and your positivity ❤️
Hi Kandee!  I don't do Instagram or other stuff, and I wondered about you!  I'm so sorry about the losses you've endured this year. You're a tough gal, Ms Johnson!  I'd love weekly vlogs, because I think you have an interesting life to share.  However, the best videos will be what YOU feel good doing!  I've been watching you for a very long time (way before Ellie) and I'll continue to watch because you are a lovely person. So glad you updated us, and I'll watch whatever you want to share!  God bless you!
Thank you Kandee for posting this. I lost my brother January of this year and it is by far the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. Losing a loved one isn’t easy to get through and almost 9 months later I’m still struggling every day. Stay strong, you’ve got this and you’re such an inspiration to many others including myself.
Kandee!!! I've been watching you since 8th grade. That's almost as long as you've been doing YouTube. You taught me how to shape my brows & much more:)
Yessss vlogs
Loveeeee youuuuuu!!! I’m so sorry about your losses. You’re one of the strongest beauty guru’s I watch. I’ve watched you tackle so much in these 10 years! So much respect to you. All my love 💕💜
I’m so sorry to hear about your family members passing away :( the clip with your grandma was so emotional to watch. You’re the most amazing, beautiful inside and out person. I love you. Keep going strong Kandee <3
You are such a genuine and strong person. Out of everyone here on YouTube I feel you are the most genuine, caring and understanding person ever. Someone who ALWAYS want to save someone. Someone who want to change the world for the better. Thank you for using your platform for something positive and being so selfless and always using time out of your busy day to make someone feel better about themselves. You are truly a legend. Someone who has touched so many lives. I am so happy that you took the time to do something for you. Going through so much in life and here you are still trying to help someone. You are such an angel and a blessing to all of us. Keep being beautiful. Keep being you because we need more people like you in the world. Love you so much! 
Enjoyed this video. Re heart/
blood pressure issues, consider consulting a Doctor of TCM, Traditional Chinese Medicine. As you may know, it operates on entirely different principles & works in entirely different ways than does Western Medicine. There's no conflict. All the best to you!
Hi Kandee, I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am to hear of your losses and your struggles with your health. I’m so glad you’re feeling better. Remember that life is not a sprint, it’s a long marathon, and to have the endurance, you must pause occasionally and take a rest. You went through a lot of loss and it would make sense that the part of you most affected by your sadness, your kind and loving heart, would give you the most trouble. I’m sure it was your body’s way of trying to get you to pay more attention to yourself. Something often experienced by true givers and achievers. Glad you took the time you needed so you can stay with us here on YouTube and continue your journey cause I wouldn’t want to see you leave. You are part of the fabric of YouTube. A reminder to me, and the rest of us who started channels years ago, of the old golden days, when YouTube was young and uncharted. There was so much discovery! We had so much fun! Your videos have been inspirational to say the least; always evident of great care, attention, and true artistry. Your audience loves you! So remember, they will love whatever you wish to share with them. Don’t be afraid to grow and change and do what inspires you, that’s part of life as a creator. Your audience will embrace you and evolve right along with you. The important thing is to take good care of yourself so you can nurture your inspiration. We’ll all be here patiently waiting till you’re ready. Sending much love, xoxo Linda❤️
Towards the end of June, my dad died, my boyfriend broke up with me, and my job got a whole new computer system that I had to learn all within two weeks and honestly positively is what helped me the most. To anyone who is going through anything tough in life, please try to stay positive! It not only helps the situation but it helps you feel good too. I love your videos Kandee, your happiness and positivity makes me feel so uplifted even on my toughest days, so thank you and God bless!!! 💕
LOVE YOU KANDEE! :) <3 you give me strength and inspire me with every single video!
you well get thousends of comments 😂😂

Yes, please, weekly vlogs 😍😍😍
Weekly or even by-weekly vlog pleaaaseeee!! But only if you're feeling up to it. <3
So much has changed in the Youtube beauty world since I first came across your videos many years ago. No matter what you do, Youtube needs more authentic, caring, good-natured people like you around. Just being you makes a huge difference in this world.
Your comments about knowing you will come out stronger after hardships.  It's something I just recently started to believe and it is so so true. Keep strong girl. You'll make it
I didn’t know how much I needed this channel until I found it
I'd love a weekly vlog 😚🤗

I would love tro see a WEEKLY vlog ,  sorry this year has been so ruff for you ...sending you HUGS <3
Your Grandmother is beautiful,
You remind me so much of my aunt that lives across the country- i love just listening to you talk. You are so clearly a genuinely sweet person.
Your grandmother is just too precious ❤️ she reminds me of my nana that is in heaven now
You look so amazing blond 😍 wish you all the best 💕
Hi kandee! Been your friend/subby since you started. To me.. YouTube is kandee Johnson and vice versa. U are amazing ;) I'm very sorry for all your loss. FROM MY HOME TO YOURS, FROM MY HEART TO YOURS, BIG HUGS😍😊😢💪👍✌💓
I want to see daily vlogs!!!
I remember the first time I heard of you it was through a link my older sister sent me years ago where you talked about your early life and hardships,she felt inspired and connected to you.
She became ill and found confidence through makeup. You were always her favorite and I’ll never forget how watching your videos and many other tutorials helped her get through life.
As simple as it may be I’ll always hold her favorite youtubers dear to me as it helped her get through the toughest of times. 

5 years ago which feels like yesterday my sister passed away at 24 a day before she turned 25. 

I’m 24 now and since she’s been gone i always tune in and developed love for the YouTube beauty community just to feel close to her.

Thank you for inspiring many throughout the years. 
❤️ we love you KANDEE!
First Youtuber I ever subscribed to, you showed me Alicia Myers' song "I want to thank you" so I thank YOU for giving me and my besty our favorite car song to sing down the street with. You're an inspiration and a trooper Kandee! Big love.
😭 Her grandmother's video made me cry. They're your little angels watching over you & your loved ones. Faith & strength* for you. 💗
You are just such a sweet person and this is so meaningful to me, all of your love and light... in light of all the other drama going on in the beauty community, it is so nice that you are always so loving, kind, respectful, and caring to other people and you work to lift people up.
God doesn’t give us anything we can’t handle. I believe our problems and hurts, if we come out on top and not let them break us, make us a stronger more influential person. Your a testimony Kandee! Keep on going sista. ❤️
Hugs are always good!
Yay to weekly vlogs!!!! 😃
Yes for vlogs!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Kandee you’re so gorgeous!! I love the blonde! So proud of how strong you are!

You deserve for these amazing comments to go on forever. Your such a sweet spirit. And you have truly been the number one real beauty YouTuber of all time in my eyes. Not only for your creative amazing work but the light that shines through you. So glad to see your beautiful face in my feed.  Oh and I would love to see vlogs.
Love you Kandee, you have made such a difference in my life and I am truly so sorry for your loss. Love and prayers to you and your family!
Self care:  what would you put in a self-care box and why?
Daily weekly whatever I can get! :)
You are such a kind soul. Stay strong girl
You are incredible Kandee! Please do weekly vlogs! I love your tutorials and your favorite products. YOU are the only reason I even have YouTube. You have made such a difference in my life. Thank you for all that you do and for being you 💗
Kandee you are so positive, so inspiring! Can you do a mix of makeup and encouraging videos please! My God continue to Bless you, I’m sending you a big hug❤️
I would love to see a book from you in the future!

LOVE YOU, Kandee!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Weekly vlogs would be amazing but do not push yourself...do what makes YOU the happiest. ✨

Gosh I love you to bits Kandee!!!  I would love to see you go into hospitals, retirement homes etc and vlog doing ladies make up to make them feel amazing and hearing a bit about their lives rather than collabs with celebrities who have access to their own make up artists. Big hugs from Australia 🇦🇺
I love you so much, Kandee❤️
Yes to the weekly vlogs!!!
OG <3
I’d love to see a “I tried following _____’s tutorial” AND more transforms and collabs!!! Take care of yourself. So glad you’re back.
A vlog would be fun. I remember Kandeeland vlogs ❤️ it wouldn’t even have to been weekly   ❤️❤️ thanks for being you.
The og of YouTube. The first one I ever watched when I discovered YouTube many many moons ago. Loved you then and still love you now 💗 huge hugs to you Kandee!
💖💕💗💞I just Love you!! I just want to give you a great big hug🤗Never change..🤘xoxoxo
I love you Kandee you’re such a beautiful person 💜
I have been watching you since the beginning and you're still the same sweet loving person every time I watch you my day gets better and you are such a positive influence on this whole generation and I just want to say thank you for being you and being positive and being caring and being honest you're an amazing person and such a great role model
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!!
Thank you Kandee for always posting empowering posts on Snapchat. I think more people in the lime light should do the same. Way to lead the way and be a great example! You go girl!! ♥️
Nno please don't quit I love you
I’ve been watching you since long before Ellie was even born! I am a huge supporter of yours. When your dad died, I just wanted to run and find you and hug you so big. I have lost both of my parents, both differently but very tragically. You and I are pretty much exactly the same age. It’s hard to lose a parent, even as an adult. Anyway! All this to say: you are loved and appreciated, you are a wonderful person, and I hope you will consider sticking around. We would genuinely miss you so greatly if you left for good. ♥️
Weekly blog pleeeeeease!!!! I love when you used to take us around with you! I’d even legit be your personal filmer and just follow you around lol. I could learn so much not only about beauty etc but more importantly, how to be so positive and energetic!
I'd love to see Halloween tutorials, and makeup applications on other people! <3 love your channel. I'm glad you're doing alright, and I'm so excited to see what's to come!
I love how amazing you are, yourself no matter what!  Id love to see weekly vlogs, you're an inspiring person Kandee! I hope you take as much time as you need to heal. BIG HUGS FROM TENNESSEE! -Carolina
Weekly vlogs....yes please🙋‍♀️!!!
I'd love to see some videos where you explore more of your Latin heritage.
Kandee, I’ve been rocking with you since college days and I’m 28 now; you’re one of the first “gurus” I started to follow. You were so fun, innovative, positive and just full of life AND YOU STILL ARE! One of the few that have never changed on this platform and we all love you deeply for it. Keep doing things exactly how you are and we will be behind you every step of the way ✊🏽❤️❤️❤️😊
I just want to see you happy. I was so sorry about your Grandma. 💙
I’ve been following you since 2009 and just want to tell you that you brought color and happiness and inspiration in a pretty dark time in my life. I’ll always be forever grateful. I’d visit your blog and be in high spirits after reading your entries. I just want to thank you for your positivity and hope we give you positivity as well in your own hard times. Love you so much!
I want to see you do what makes your heart happy. Challenges, transformations, house tours during the holidays, weekly vlogs. Please, just let us love and support you for what makes you happy. 💜 Much hugs and love to you.
We love you and support you! Be safe and continue to take care of yourself. Maybe, some self care, beauty relaxation videos?
U r si loved, don't  go away gorgeous,  u have such a big heart
I was off your yt for a while and didn’t know what was going on. I’m sending you positive vibes and hugs. I would really love to see a daily xmas blog. Looking forward to christmas season!
Hi Kandee, I’ve been watching your videos since I saw your lil dulce dulce video in 2010 and just wanted to say how uplifting your videos make me feel even on the worst days ❤️
You are one of the first makeup artist I started watching on You Tube , I love everything you have done, but my favorites are still reviews on new makeup I love to hear your take on them and also application and wear, I also love hearing about skin care as well,one of my favorite products you talked about to date has to be the burts bees citrus facial scrub,which I can't actually purchase in Canada anymore :(  but please keep doing what you do !!!
I hope you see this. You are inspirational and beautiful and kind and honest. I appreciate the things I have seen from you and learned from you. Your dad, grandma, and grandpa are all looking down on you and very proud of you. Thank you for being so awesome!
I lost 3 uncles in a period of 4 months. It was the hardest thing my family has ever been through. They were all my dads brothers and seeing my dad so hurt was the hardest part of it all. Time heals it all and makes us stronger ❤️ love your videos; thanks for sharing with us.
Weekly vlogs please!!!!! I remember the first video I watched by you was the one about distressing jeans hahaha that was like 9 years ago!! I love watching you grow!
Don't know Kandee, but what a lovely lady, good luck sweetheart xx
I'm so sorry to hear all your  sad happenings.  I truly wish to express my sympathy 💓 
Please consider vlogs we all love you. My daughter and I used to watch you together 💋💋
I’ve read a lot of comments about you being the big sister on the internet and that is the perfect way to describe it!! I never had anybody in my life to teach me how to do hair and make up until I found your channel. There were numerous nights where I couldn’t sleep due to depression and anxiety, and your videos were there to occupy my thoughts instead of me letting them run wild. When I was pregnant your pregnancy/labor videos helped calm my nerves. You’ve always been there with your little heart and powerful positivity and I love you as much as I could love somebody I’ve never met lol. 

Thank you for everything 💚
Yay! So good to see your shining face on YouTube! When I heard the news of your grandma, I cried and I just want to let you know if your reading this, that meeting your grandma was such a special experience in my life. I can't even believe someone could make me laugh so much! You continue to be an inspiration to me and I think of you often. Especially when I drive by your old place and remember actually meeting you. I remember being so nervous to meet someone who I looked up to so much.  You are always such a star and carry yourself like a queen...always! My heart goes out to you for all you have experienced in the past year. Congrats on your nomination! I love your heart! Thank you for being you ♥️
Kandee I love you so much, you are beyond the real deal and for opening up on loss is so so hard. You are in my prayers and I'm so thankful for you. Your life today looks happy and you've come far from being this person you are in the video. Meaning you are special no matter what you have going on and you are never mean about anything. Great advise you've given in this video. I love you so much and sorry for your loss. Hugs and Love to you <3  xoxo
I'm only new to your channel... but I forsee a day of Kandee while I get my Capsule Collection Runway ready... have a fantastic day lovely <3
“You’re more beautiful than you know, you’re more talented than you think & you’re more loved than you can imagine” 

I remember how you saying exactly this on your old videos pushed me to keep going forward with life, career and this time it couldn’t have come in a better time! 

Thank you Kandee for always sharing your genuine love & spirit 💖 can’t wait to see what’s next!!!!!
Kandee.Ive always loved your channel.You've been a role model to be from your faith your creativity and your heart! No matter what your going threw.Im always here to watch your channel! 💋
Hey Sweetpea, it's been a heartbreaking year for you and you do need to keep your little heart happy. It's always ok to take the time that you need to recover from everything, it's a huge blow to lose all of those super wonderful influences in your life. I feel your love and I hope you can feel mine back. Huge love sweetie, xo ❤️
Kandee I’m sorry for your loss! 😢
Please stay strong! I know it’s not easy to deal with losing family members. I lost my grandma 10 years ago but I still feel like it was yesterday. I still can’t get over the fact that she is no longer amongst us. 
Your videos has always helped me in so many ways. Thank you for being the genuine person that you are!
I want Kandee vlogs!
Sorry you’ve had a bad year, keep strong and stay gorgeous. <3
Kandee! You are amazing, so strong, and such a beautiful soul! I genuinely cannot thank you enough for all the hope and support you have given me over the years! (I've been watching you since 2010!!) And your grandma = badass, just like you <3
You look absolutely gorgeous 💕 if you write a book I’m soooo buying it
Your grandma looks like she was such a sweet old lady. I lost mine before I was old enough to really appreciate her. Keep reminding yourself how lucky you are to have known her so well.x
Love you Kandee! You are sonreal and so special!
EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. Grieves differently, and that is OK! That is what makes us unique. What bothers one person terribly, may not bother someone else at all. Our hearts and minds handle things differently and we deal with those hardships at our own pace. Being a public figure does NOT mean you are owned by the public. I appreciate everything you post and everything you CHOSE to share because it is not easy to open up necessarily. You are the OG Beauty Guru of YouTube (and I feel you are finally getting the recognition you deserve!! 💃🏻💖) I would love to see you do some fun CHALLENGES and COLLABORATIONS!! I would also love for you to have a Spiritual reading done because I feel it would bring peace to your heart. Regardless of what you chose to do, I will continue to support and root for you!! Xoxo Jenn 💖💕
Are you Latina?  Your gramasaid something in Spanish. She was absolutely adorable. Rip grandma. 🙏😘 Ok well I would love to see your work out routine?
Weekly vlog would make me so happy :) Please do it!!!!  sending you and your family love and peace xxoo Susan & Desi
Mexicans grandmas are the best !!!!!!😍 sorry for your lost
I want a hug! 🤗🤗🤗💗
I want to see a weekly vlog. I love you so much kandee I always will.
Oh Kandee....😭♥️
I hope you read this...
I’m probably one of your first followers. A big fan from Germany....from the day you started on YouTube I’m in love with your energy, your videos, your glow...just the way you are! 
You’re awesome...you’ve always been awesome. Your heart is like the purest thing on earth...and I feel happy for you and your choices...
I want to thank you for everyday you gave me strength with your wonderful advices.
Please never give up that beautiful kandeeish Style you are. Please Never give up...I love you Kandee 🙏🏼♥️

God bless your beautiful soul! ♥️♥️😢
So sorry for all the things you have been going through...You are a gem and always an inspiration <3. Thanks for sharing your heart <3
I cried so much watching this video because I have really missed Kandee and your encouragement! The ten years of watching you has been my rock and hope in my life. You are the only reason I made it through my post-pardom depression, I just love you and the beauty you give to others. I would often stay up late after my kids went to sleep working on my college classes and watching Kandee. I hope some day yo meet you😘😘😘so much love and support coming again and always from Arizona:)
Hi Kandee, we all love you very much. Can you post a video about your current skincare routine. You seem to be aging backward.
we love you and your videos!
we will always love your grandma and grand pa and we always love the kandee girl!
You were one of the first people on YouTube I started watching. I remember telling everyone about you. Thank you for being so kind and inspiring. Yes please to weekly blogs. I appreciate  everything you've done, there are many times you picked me back up
plz don't u r my favourite YouTuber
I love your transformations, and challenges are fun, but I would love more heartfelt content like this video!  I love learning more about your beautiful soul <3
I love it when you sit down and talk to us. You are so inspiring and beautiful.
I'm so sorry for your loss, even tho I didn't know your grandma she brought me the greatest joy, she made me laugh. I don't know how many times I watched that video u did with her. I hope you feel better. I will keep u and your family in my prayers♡♡♡♡♡
I miss your videos so much
Love you so much!!
I dont know what your fan base is but I'm struggling with how my 46 yro face looks after I do my makeup..it doesn't look good In selfies....
I didn’t know all that happened in such a short time. You and your family have my deepest sympathy. You look so good! You even look younger to me.♥️
Yes yes to vlog pleaseeeeee
You are so awesome Kandee, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise! Your videos helped me a lot when I lost my grandma and I would love to see more vids...whether it would be a tutorial or a weekly vlog, I’m here for it ♥️👌🏼
yess please do weekly vlogs! you're always an inspiration Kandee, hang in there & keep spreading your love!!
HI Kandee! I have to say, I used to love when you would post about working out and what music you would listen to on your playlist. And if you have transformation vids, that would be great to see! Especially for a new year! Sorry for all the losses you've personally dealt with. These kinds of things do make us stronger and make life that much more worth living to the fullest. However that is hard to see at times. Weekly VLOGS  would be fantastic!! I am a HUGE supporter of being positive, inspiration and making things change for the better. I know that if you keep doing this for 2019, it could benefit so many people who need to hear it, maybe they don't know you and one more person will be impacted by your incredible talent!
I’ve always been a fan, just recently started getting into YouTube and I love your genuine and inspirational channel. Maybe you can broaden your channel? I know you’re all about makeup, but loved seeing this type of vlog. I’m all about Lifestyle inspo, God continue to bless! ❤️
Kandee. No one can understand how one feels after losing loved ones until they have experienced themselves. Sending love and prayers your way. Thanks for all you share with us. Be well and get to where you need to be.
Kandee, thank you. Thank you for everything. You’re such an amazing person. You are such a positive, beautiful soul! You deserve the best and more!! You’ve been through so much, and you keep going, and you’ve inspired me to keep going! I have a bad habit of making things about myself, so I’m not gonna do that. I’m just gonna say thank you for all your positive quotes, and your beautiful smile, and your jokes, and just your beautiful self! I love you, Kandee. Stay strong xx😘
Yes weekly vlog would be nice and please please post  the 23 and me I wanna do that test but I need to be convinced please post it love you xoxo 💚 💚💗 💗❤️😘 😘
When you said, "...add positivity, hope, fun to add to your life... might be a book in there... inspire people..." I got a chill & message: your grandma, your pure model of this all of your life, will help guide you with it from where she now is. Listen for her. 
I found you in a YT search YEARS ago because I needed to know how to cut up a t-shirt! You were so FUN to watch doing/talking about anything, and truly genuine in your silliness and sweetness. I recall my husband asking what I was watching and why, and I said, "She is just happy to watch." Whether or not your content related to me on some videos was irrelevant.  
YOUR SUCCESS IS INSPIRING TO WOMEN, you are simply a powerful, delightful beam of hope by just living and sharing your life. (((hug))) - Jennifer  PS- +1 on weekly vlog :-)
I wanna see you reach out and do more fun stuff with your fans. People who have been watching you for years. Makeovers, photo shoots, you name it!
You’re such a doll. I’ve been through 3 hard losses this year, and I know how hard it can be. You’re making the right decisions and i would hope every person would support you. You’re always sunshine on my insta feed and every where else I see you. I probably look at you as one of the sweetest, realest person that’s famous. I always trust you and what you say because you’re so genuine and down to earth, even though you’re a mega star now! Love and healing prayers to you, forever and always, no matter what you do. We get but one life, you do you boo, and what’s good for you. Love you 😘
I just want to say that I love you Kandee❤️You are so incredibly inspiring. I’ve been watching your videos for 8 years now and I will never stop supporting you.
Sending love and hugs your way. I’d love to see a weekly vlog and I’d love to see a tutorial on the look you’re wearing now. It’s flawless
Weekly vlogs 😍
WEEKLY VLOG!!
Love you Kandee and am so glad that you are back! I wish you nothing but the best.
U inspire me to be the best me and I hope u give urself the time to grieve and heal. I would love to see more videos from u. Love ur friend from a little town in Washington.
I love you so much Kandee 💜💜💜💜💜
I love you so much 
I know how you feel ❤️❤️❤️
Just stay strong and know we got ur back we are here for you and we are praying for you i love you bunches 💗 from an a follower of 8 yearz
My vote for the weekly vlog!!! Though a book is even more exciting!   I've also come a long way with learning how much to keep private, I used to overshare with everyone when I was younger and it wasn't usually a good idea! Not easy to find a balance. <3  Best wishes!
Weekly vlog!!!!
I miss you
This might be irrelevant now but I feel like I need to say it. It's about blood pressure. My mom (super healthy) was having mysterious blood pressure spikes and we couldn't figure out why. They tested EVERYTHING and we couldn't figure it out. The very LAST option was to go to a sleep study and it turns out she had sleep apnea. She is not overweight or typical for apnea... but once she started treating the apnea her BP was back to normal. So please check that when you're out of ideas. Be well ❤
Weekly vlog would be cool!!!!
Your grandma's spirit is very inspiring. Sending you all the love! & yes, count me in for the weekly vlogs. xoxo
Love you so much 💖you are such a great inspiration to the youth & a blessing to everyone. Love your abuelita and she’s with Dios with that being said you will see her again 😘.  Pls keep blessing us with your wholesomeness, love for Christ & inner/outer beauty
I love you so much Kandee. You've never stopped being authentic for a day in your life, and I wish so badly I was one of your friends IRL so I could give you a hug and be there for you when you need it because you deserve it and have earned it more than most people I've known. Even through your difficulties you are an inspiration, it's incredible. I love you and here's to sunshinier days 🌻
obviously we want weekly vlogs!! Any content that you can provide but also we (and I mean we who "believe-you-are-a-human-been-like-us" want you to be ok.. happy and most important we want you to be healthy for yourself and your family. So you do what you got to do in order to feel yourself again knowing that we will always love you and be here for you! <3 <3
(((((Hugs)))))
I’d love a weekly vlog 💜
Your hair looks great !!
Daily vlog!!!
Please never ever discount your own life, losses, experiences, etc. There is absolutely no way to even compare lives because everyone is so completely different. I do however completely understand where you are coming from with everything going on... that was my 2017. My 6 1/2 month old son passed away on 4/4/17 and within a couple months I also lost my grandma and then a couple weeks after that I lost my uncle. It blows my mind how life can just throw so damn much at you in such a short time. It definitely makes you stronger when it happens that way though. 

I’d love to see some vlogs, more makeup tutorials, and collabs (I loved your collaboration with Molly Burke so much!)..
So is she quitting YouTube or nah? Or is it clickbait? Too lazy to watch the video.
Would actually like to see more personal vids. Maybe show ur beautiful kids a bit, family friends. Just an idea
Weekly vlog please
I remember when I first started watching you in 2009 and I was in so much pain. You’ve helped me get through Loss. And I wanted to say thank you for putting your love out to the universe. I am sorry you’re heart has been in so much pain kandee. You and your family deserve the entire world. I would love to see you make crafts and clothes !!!! They where my favorite back when I first started watching you! Awww I just love you so much you inspiring angel ☁️🌟☁️☁️☁️🌟🌻🌻🌳May love and light surround you xoxo
I'm excited!! I just found your YouTube and it looks like the perfect time. Can't wait to see what the next step in your YouTube life is going to be 😊😊😊💕💕💕😊😊😊
daily vlogs please. love you so much so honest and grounded missed your videos. your so stunning inside and out. so sorry for your losecand pain keep smiling 🙂xxx
also, would LOVE KANDEE VLOGS!!!
Kandee, your videos have always been my favorite, you were the first person i subscribed to!  I have enjoyed all of your content, from fun family videos, to tutorials, to cooking...I'd enjoy whatever you upload!
Kandee, you're such a lovely person! I really wish all the best to you because you deserve it all! Thank you for being really inspiring and motivational! You always make me smile whenever I see your videos, insta stories, or anything! Can't thank you enough! Huge hugs from my house to yours! :) xoxoxoxo
For me you also were one of the first youtubers I subscribed for. And yeah, it was like a decade or so ago :)
I want to see more videos of yours. Please, upload anything. I'll watch. It's nice to watch a nice person here on youtube :)
You really inspire. I wish there were less hard times for you and more good times :) Stay positive. You are good and you're worth good.
Sending lots of love from the other side of the ocean. <3
I would love to see weekly vlogs if you are up for it... don’t stress yourself taking on more than you can. Take your time. People who love you will always be there ❤️
Taking a break when you need to is healthy! Your community here on YT loves you and is here to watch your videos whenever you have the time and energy to share! xo
Poor thing! ❤️❤️ Keep a vlog we wanna support you Kandee
@KandeeJohnson I'm so sorry that your heart's hurting and has been through so much loss! I am inspired by you, your tutorials, your beautiful individual style, your kind heart and I am grateful for you and the knowledge you share! You are amazing 💗.  I'd love to read your book! Your collabs are so fun, but so are all your videos  🤗 🎉😎
It has been a long time since I visited your channel. Back when I was very into make up and all that. Recently I had the thought that I had not come here in a long time. And low and behold this video cropped up in my suggestions. Coming back after all this time, your personality and kind nature has not changed and that is so refreshing to see. I am very sorry to hear of the grief you have suffered over the past year and also the issues with your health. Take time to heal, never appologise for it. Take care of yourself first and all of the people who are here to support you and have been for so many years will understand and will be here for when you are ready and well in yourself. I am so glad I stumbled across your video, your realness and your honesty are something we can all learn from and it is something you should be so proud of. I hope the rest of your year is brighter and I hope your health continues to get better x
Kandee I will always love you 💜
I've followed you for 10 years, you are an amazingly inspiring woman! I love your spirit your the OG beauty guru. And the most truthful person in the beauty community. Peeps need to take a leaf out of your book, can't wait to see what to have up your sleeve. Xo 👌 Northen Ireland fan 100%
Please do weekly videos. Love your videos
Kandee, 
Your a beautiful, kind, down to the earth woman. Your beautiful inside and and out, I just love you girl! It’s hard losing family, God knows, I have lost many loved ones. I still cry to this day, but we must go on for ourselves and our children. I wish you all the best luv, and be very strong! 💕🙏🏻💕🙏🏻  Big Hugs!
Kandee,  I love you!  You are one of the real ones here on YouTube!  I have been a subscriber since the beginning. You have such a loving kind heart! ❤❤❤❤❤ ALSO,  remember, this to shall past!!
You are awesome and I love watching you, film anything, weekly vlog or challenge, don’t let your channel to die. We llove you ♥️♥️♥️ Stay strong 💪🏻 beautiful girl ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️😘
Yes she looked terrific!!! Awwww Grandma was so awesome!! ❤️❤️
It is so wonderful to see your beautiful face again! 😍😇I'm sorry for everything you've dealt with in the past year I feel like this year has been a bit crazy for everyone to say the least! I would love to see more collaboration videos or anything you're comfortable sharing with us 👍you're such a beautiful soul! God bless you Kandee!💞💋💄👑
Best of luck with the next part of your journey. Downside to this video there was a lot of ranting on and on and on. In my opinion I like videos quick to the point.
So good to see you! Have missed you but having said that I'm very sorry for your loss. Not sure how those sad waves make you stronger, it's so hard, but glad you can take it this way. Take it as a lesson.
@kandeejohnson You are inspiring and motivating. Your positivity is so encouraging. I followed you when I began my beauty therapy 5years ago. Even though I'm across the world from you I feel like your a friend. Your words speak to me profoundly, I'm still learning but really want you to know you have helped me with my beauty studies - personal/life situations - everyday experiences..everything! Its refreshing to know that even though you seem perfect you are like anybody and have struggles and "normal" 
Weekly vlogs would be cool, videos of how /things you do to stay positive. Parenting advice, how you juggle working and being a mum. Transformations have always been the best. A book sounds awsoume!!! Anything you do is amazing though! Much love from Australia xoxo
Sending lots of love your way Kandee, have an amazing day 💗💗💗💗💗💗 and yes, thumbs up for weekly vlogs 🤗
I have never left a comment on any yt vid but you are incredible, so strong and an amazing woman who’s true beauty is from within. Your loved ones all live in you and and even though I’ve never met any of them but the brief glances and stories you have shared but they have shaped you into such a beautiful strong woman. Keep doing you. Let your light shine. You will be in my prayers. I love all the videos where you use makeup to look like other celebrities u just amaze me. But you are so creative and talented I don’t think you can do anything wrong.
Kandee I noticed you haven’t been taking care of yourself for a long time. Not enough sleep ever, eating on the fly, adding stress to that it’s no wonder your health went downhill. I’m so happy you are taking care of you now. Focus on you. A weekly vlog is great. It can be a grwm and here’s my day type of thing. Once a week wb great. It will allow you time to focus on you. You are important. God Bless you and your family.
Thanks for sharing I loved seeing your grandma she reminded me of my abuela “gramita” so full of love and positivity ❤️. I’m sorry for your losses my condolences. Sometimes we need a break to deal with all the changes that take so much out of us. We’re human and can only handle so much at different phases of life. I really admire your resilience.
Big, huge hugs from my heart to yours, Kandee! A book would be so fantastic! You have so much inspiration in your soul to share! I would love a weekly vlog from you!
You were one of the first people I watched on YouTube at 14 years old and your transformation videos amazed me I had never seen anything like that before. You inspired me so much and gave me the confidence to just try at makeup and makeup is my biggest passion. You have always been so positive and sweet and just such an important part of the YouTube community. Life is hard and your breaks are totally understandable don’t feel bad about it. Love you Kandee!
I’m so so happy that ur going to continue doing videos!👏🏼 U have no idea how much u inspire me & help me get thru my days! Ur always so uplifting & positive, especially after all of the loss in your life. Ur so amazing & beautiful on the inside & out! I don’t know how u do it. A few years ago w/in a few months I lost my brother/best friend, which I’m still having a hard time with. Also lost my Aunt, my god brother, my grandpa & 2 really good friends!😰 It was a months of sadness, one after another. I felt as if I was cursed & it was so nice to watch your awesome uplifting videos & read your inspiring msgs on Twitter! I totally adore u & inspire to be more like u!💝 
I’m sorry for all of your losses. Continue to be your beautiful awesome self! Sending good vibes & prayers your way! Much❤️👼🏻!💋😘
Thank you for being so honest and its totally under stable why you are private. Everything shouldn't be public, keeping things private is important. I catch myself doing the same, keeping everything inside 💗
I love this. Everyone goes through losses and changes. We can all support each other ❤️ here is to 10 more years
You are so talented, gorgeous and one of kind   I follow you for all those reasons,  what I miss is you sharing those things! 5% of people are haters and I know those voices are louder in our heads but the rest of us are full of support and want to feel close to you and your videos have just felt like you are just going through the motions and strangely it’s hurtful as a longtime viewer. Like I treated you badly and don’t get the privilege to know you . It’s all you decision but as social media changes so do we..... love you and thank you for all the content through the years!
MY FEEDBACK!- i want to see you! Just you, normal ole you!! Please! Fyi, i have been subscribed for years and i just saw this video. 😑
it would be great if you go back to basics tutorials. nothing overdone or fancy or crazy collabs or challenges.  just your amazing personality and positivity in basic makeup artist tutorials
OMG reading the title I was like noooo:'(:'(:'(:'( quitting YouTube? But of course your coming thru no matter WHAT!  You were the first youtuber I started watching when I discovered youtube jeje. my first video was you cutting your t shirts and making your anchor necklace. ♥YOU truly are the biggest inspiration I have ever. YOU are such a strong woman with all of life's challenges. P.s. I wish I could run into you just so I could say I've seen kandee my life is complete NOW.  You are sooo loved. Love you ALWAYS KAndee♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
I hope you will do more ambush makeovers ❤️love you Kandee

Weekly vlog!!!!!
Oh Kandee.. you’re such a beautiful mystical unicorn is a crazy, chaotic world. 💕 you made me cry a little.
Thanks for the hugs thru the screen, I really needed it! Hugging you back!! 

Fun video idea, maybe? Tye dye tshirts or a craft with the family, show off your creations with a fun photo shoot or something... plus as many tutorials as you can think of, I love those!!
"Bigger, bolder, braver" words to live by.
We want the weekly vlog! Don't disappear!
Crazy it’s been almost 10 years I remember the video you cut up the football shirt
I’m so sorry for your loss. Grief is the cost of love. I’ll be praying for you

Well your views are down bigtime. Hope you know what your giving up.
Title is Clickbait. She's not leaving YT.
Make up videos and favorites videos
Weekly vlog if you want to 😘
You are such an inspiration! Daily vlogs please!
I'm so happy I came across your channel years ago. I can be having a bad day or week and hearing you be so positive and kind will turn my whole attitude around. It's lovely to see such a pretty lady such as yourself is so generous! It's not often you see this. I can't wait to see more videos :)
Vlogs please xx
Oh my gosh I couldn't imagine losing that many family members in that short amount of time...I'm so sorry! I hope that life gets better for you!
KANDEE! My heart smiled when I saw you uploaded!! 💓💓💓words cant describe how much I love you Kandee. You’re my role model. Ever since I was 6 and started watching your videos, you’ve made me so happy, even when I’m going through hard times. Daily vlogs sound AMAZING!! Please remember how loved you are, always!!❤️❤️ xoxo!
3:08 your LITTLE heart? You have one of the BIGGEST hearts I  have ever seen! I am so sorry to hear that you are quitting YouTube. I am sad that you are, but do what wakes you happy. I love you soooooo much Kandee!!😘❤
I say do whatever makes you happy hun!❤
Kandee you are the first youtuber I started watching and still continue to watch. I love your videos, your inspiring words, and your positive outlook! Looking forward to what you have in store!!  I am SO Sorry for all of the loss you've had this past year. <3 So glad you are still going to be making videos! <3 <3
Crying so hard right now with love and pride and gratitude for you, Kandee. Life has thrown some waves into my life this year and I didn't fully realize how much I missed you. Whenever I saw anything posted I just prayed you were doing ok and not pushing yourself too hard. I put off watching this for a while because...I don't know, maybe I wasn't ready yet. And today was the perfect day to see it. To know you've turned a corner, to learn of your family members and to cry for such great losses, and to be encouraged once again by your sweet words at just the right time in my life right now. I reflected earlier today that you were the first youtuber I followed -- and I just love you so much!! Thank you for all you have been to me, inspiring me spiritually and emotionally with the confidence that comes through having fun with makeup. You are truly a God-send. ❤
I would love to see more of your fun every day look tutorials (because I miss seeing you work your blending magic I've come to see is a very unique skill!) or maybe a monthly or bi-monthly favorites video. Anything really though just seeing you again is going to be the best!! Love you love you 😄 Huge hugs to you!!! 😘😘😘
I don't know if you ever done this but I personally am still learning about make up at 24 & would love to see or hope to see if you can do make up for beginners? Love you Kandee & my prayers are with you. God bless❤
Was wondering.. Good luck & be safe👍💋🙋.. Always believe
Sending you a huge hug!!!! My condolences to you and your family! Your Grandma seems like she was a great woman and I’m absolutely positive she was so proud of you ❤️ I believe for each challenge we face and concur, we get to know ourselves better. It’s amazing how much strength we have within. 

For some ideas 💡, I would love to see you recreate some 90s iconic Music Video looks...with your modern twist to them. Or some of histories most iconic women, and how their looks would be interpreted today. I think that would be really cool to see through your eyes. 

Weekly Vlogs would be awesome!!! My vote is yes for those 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I love you so much! I've been watching you since I was 14. You always made me feel good when I was having a bad day and even a good day. I know what it's like to cover up the pain and be happy Kandee, I love you so much I hope the best for you and pray you'll feel healing from your pains and have at least one person your confident to share it with. You mean so much to me, you always will, love Sarah ♥️
We only want you to get better and healthy,  I hope you take some down time and write that book bae, YOU ARE AMAZING AND YOU ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOVED
Don't worry Kandee. We always got your back. 😄
Eating food that is too salty can raise your blood pressure.
Kandee, you are one of the first youtuber i subscribed. And everything, every video, every post, i follow. You are amazing and totally want to see your weekly vlog. I remember when you were pregnant of Ellie, it was so emotional!!!! Feel free to share your struggles, it makes you lighter. Love you, hope to see you one day. Love from France!!!!!!
Omg yasss weakly blogs please I would absolutely love that
We love you Kandee<3 I'm so sorry for you losses my heart is go's out to you & your family but I'm glad to see that your doing good & hangin in there! I'll be praying for you Kandee!!:) Xoxo
We love you for all you do Kandee! Anything you want to give us we will take, I know I look forward to any video you have done just you're kind beautiful soul make the videos. Daily weekly vlogs collabs transformations whatever your heart desires.
😋😘Kandee’s book should be called:
 Kandee’s Land of Positivity

“You’re more beautiful than you know, you’re more talented than you think, and you’re more loved than you could possibly imagine, from this girl named Kandee.”

Keep your chin up and find the light in everything (you’re already amazing at that but sometimes we still need someone to remind and support us)!

I’d love to see the 23 & Me video. Also! Weekly vlogs? Yes please!!!
you were the first person i started watching on youtube when i was around 13/14 after my friend showed me makeup tutorials, i have been subscribed since and got so invested in your personal life as well as your amazing tips! i havent watched your videos for quite a while but you're so warm and beautiful and i feel like i have gone back 8 years and its crazy how much my life has changed while i can still just sit down and watch your videos xxx
Hang in there! It seems like when it rains, it pours. Much love to you! You are the very first makeup artist I followed on youtube, and I've always loved your tips, tricks and transformations.
Kandee, I have never posted a comment on any YouTube video before and I'm sure you won't see this, but you saved me. I was the same holding everything inside while going through a lot of loss and it broke me enough to think I was ready to just end it. Then I found your channel about 5 years ago while sitting in Hospice with my Mamaw. You're positivity and light shines through and is so genuine. It made me feel everything would be okay. Please keep making videos and a weekly vlog will be great. I honestly feel I owe you my life. Thank you 💖
Why can't people LOOK in the camera... Omg... 😂😂😂😂😂
Hey darling <3 It's a long time I started to follow you, and you are the same lovely amd funny girl of the beginning. I'm really happy to see you back on YT, and I'd like to see some challenges & a weekly vlog xx
I have just came across your videos, Hi Kandee from a new subby 🙋🏼‍♀️ This video had me in tears, my grandma passed away recently and she meant so much to me, I'm sending you and your family love at this difficult time with the loss off your family members! 💜
I was overjoyed with seeing your pretty face pop up in my feed!! I’m so sorry you’ve been going through so much...Whatever you need to do for you and to take care of yourself, is perfectly fine. ❤️
I want tutorials to be just that. TUTORIALS. be the teacher again. I feel now that most youtubers make vids but arent teaching the techniques anymore and explaining the hows and whys and what you really should be aiming for and trying to do when applying makeup.  Sometimes I feel that vids now are for ppl that already know how to do makeup. I just want you all to be the great teachers that you started out as in the beginning;) love you💜💜💜
I have been watching your content for years and I got my daughter into watching you as well. You are so full of light and life and in today's world, people like you are so rare. I am so sorry for your losses. Losing people who have impacted your life and have always been there is a hard thing to go through. But you are strong and it shows. Let it continue to be your strength! We all love you<3
Travel the world in search of beauty. Share other culture’s beauty secrets with your subs. Who knows you might meet your soulmate. The person you were meant to be with.
Weekly vlogs please Kandee, I would love to see more into your life xx
I miss original videos!!! Literally you taught me to do makeup! Everyone always asks me how I got so good, and it always comes to late nights watching you and copying your tutorials!!
Love You Kandee ❤... always have, always will... Best of All Life has to offer you... I WILL miss seeing your videos... Carry On Girlfriend 💖👍💖
I will stop you if I ever see you! Idk when or how that would happen. I live in a small town in Texas. I hope I can meet you one day.
Your grandma is so cute!! Lost my grandma a few weeks ago too. So sorry. It’s so hard saying goodbyev
YouTube has changed so much. I loved it so much before PR began taking the lead on YouTube. I miss the regular “hauls” in which you went out and picked out products all by yourself and told us exactly what you thought of them. These days all the beauty channels are reviewing the same latest releases by the high end cosmetic companies that send them the entire latest collection ahead of time. Even if they are not sponsored they seem sponsored because they all want to stay on that PR list! No one does their own shopping when they are being sent thousands of dollars worth of free product all the time. It just seems that the big corporations are pretty much running some of the beauty channels now.
Hi Kandee I never had a YouTube account but I always watched your videos sonce you started and I just can’t believe it’s been 10 years. Anyway just want to finally leave a comment (using my kids account lol) But I just want to thank you! you taught me many tricks and tips on how to put on make up. You don’t change you’re as beautiful as always. God bless you. My heart goes out to you. Last year sept. 2017 up until June of this year we had so many deaths in our lives too. I dealt with it & can only imagine the pain you go through being a public figure. Take care of your self. We will still be here when you’re up and better. xoxo! Sandy (Kait & Dylan’s mom)💖
You are a breath of fresh air! Love you
you have to do you first.. I LOVE your videos and miss them but we all understand.. sometimes you have to just take a step back and breath... :)
Do we have a thousand comments!!!!!!!
Kandee, you’re a gift from GOD to humanity. So sweet! Love you! Been a subbie forever!
Dear Kandee, please upload videos that you have fun filming.
That's whats fun to see for your subscribers💖 even if you think it did not  end up good. (Which it propably did!!) Lot's of love.
I just want to see you. So if that's you daily, weekly or monthly, then awesome! And when you need breaks ,hey we all do ,so take those breaks and recharge. Sorry for all your lose,but they are watching you from heaven. Love ya! So glad your back.
We want weekly blogs! We want a book too! I'm so glad you reached out, we have missed you and your beautiful 💓
You're stronger than you think, girl.  Take care of YOU. Take care of your health...it is THE most important thing. (Trust me, I know)  We'd love to see more vlogs from you if you're up for it.  But as I said...take care of YOU.  Sending hugs and warm wishes...
Ohhhh Kandee... Lots of Love from my Little Brocken Heart to yours.
I will  admit, I haven't followed you before now,  but your thumbnail captured my attention.  I am so sorry for all your losses.  When I saw your video clip with your grandma, it just brought tears to my eyes.  You will be so thankful in years to come that you have these videos of her.  I lost my mom 4 years ago and I have a couple of videos saved and obviously many pictures.  My heart and prayers go out to you as you navigate grief and life.  Best wishes for you and your future.
I have been right along side you since the beginning. I would like you to know that Ive been by your side, metaphorically, in all the things that have happened in your life. I feel your hurt and I cheer you on. You have been an inspiration to so many, and (although I have not been through your life experiences yet in life) I know that I can come back and watch your videos when I need encouragement. Thank you for continuing to make videos to teach, guide, and inspire so many people including me. Much love. ❤
Please do weekly vlog. You are such a strong, powerful women and you do go through hard times. You would help many, myself included, if you would just talk to us once a week.
♥️💜♥️💜♥️💜love&hugs your way💜♥️💜♥️💜♥️
I love you so much
I’ve always admired your honesty and vulnerability. Thanks for sharing, girl. 🖤
Awww Kandee, you’re literally beautiful in every possible way. So sorry to hear you’ve been going through such a tough time. It’s been a crazy year astrologically speaking. If you’d love guidance on how best to deal with the energies associated with each week, highly recommend my YouTube series ‘Weekly Angel Guidance.’ Sending you so much love from Australia xx
I. Love. You.
Glad that you are posting on YouTube again. Im sorry you lost family members, that is terrible. We love you and will support you no matter what 💕 happy with any video you post, I missed you so much on here. ❤️
I developed a heart condition after my grandmother passed away last yr.  She was my best friend.   I hear ya
Weekly vlogs!!!!!!!!
You will never be missed ANTI-VAXXER! Succumb to crevices of hell.
We love you Kandee, always will 🥰
Yes, would love to see weekly vlogs.
Loss is so hard, I lost 6 family members in 4 years including my sister. It’s so hard.
<3 :*
I wish you could do my makeup lolz it's hard to feel confidence as a transgender woman and not feel great at doing your makeup
I am so so sorry this comment is late but you have been my inspiration for me starting makeup and my career. You mean so much to not only me,, but so many others. You are like the main OG of the beauty communtity. And the community will not be the same without you but either way, you are still a legend. You will continue to to inspire me each and every day. I always watch your videos and old videos just for tips and tricks. Thank you for everything. I love you Kandee!!😘😘💕🍭🍬💕🍭🍬🍭💕🍬🍭💕🍬
KANDEE VLOGS <3
Omg kandee you are amazing you have taught me so much about make up & you always look fabulous I wish there was a way to have you do my makeup for my wedding in 2 years that would amazing I love you  you are amazing
I miss the "old" Kandee... like your labor video how many years ago?!  But she's gone, never to come back.  Good luck with everything you do.  You will be prayed for always. xoxo
Kandees literally beautiful inside & out 💕 I’m so sorry for your loss 🙏🏼
You are a strong and resilient woman, Kandee. I'm glad you took the time to take some healing steps. Put yourself and your heart first, no matter what!
I’m here to find new beauty gurus. For real
I would love to see a weekly vlog, it would be so fun. I’m so sorry for your losses. I’m glad you are feeling better. Wish you all the best in life. ❤️
Kandee you are the most talented, loving, genuine, and authentic woman on YouTube. I've been a fan from the beginning. The end of this video almost brought be to tears. XOXO
🌟I miss the OLD you tube ... makeup tutorials on different complexions and age groups !
I’m so sorry for your losses.. :( I lost my mom and also my best friend this past year.. and I can barely function. You are such an inspiration.. I can’t wait to reach the point of “stronger” because right now, i feel the weakest I’ve ever been. You take all the time you need, sweetheart. Be patient with yourself. This is not an easy road 💕
Never have seen your videos...but can tell you have a big heart.  I am probably around ur grandmas age...and she seems like a sweetie like you. Best to you in all you do. Hugs Anita
@kandee i just want to say i love u!!! U have been such an inspiration and great person to watch throughout the years! Stay strong lil heart..... i would love to see ur transformation / exercise  videos...
It doesn't feel like you're talking to us because you're not looking into the camera... 😔
Definitely would love to see weekly vlogs from you!!
👍 to the vlog 😉
<3
I still can’t believe she’s 40... she kinda looks like Gwen Stefani. And neither of them age 😂😂
You look so cute here omg
Weekly vlog! Also 💗💗💗💗💗you. Big hugs
Yaaaaasss weekly vlog!!!! I will watch ANYTHING u put up. I just love YOU. Ur one of the first people that I subbed too and you have been an inspiration to me ever since. Ur positive attitude and lovely out look on life... u r a special person! I love u and will always watch anything you put up. You make any video fun!
Love you Kandee I never forget when I met you in Garland TX at Ulta! I can’t wait to meet you again someday!
Prayers.
I’m so sorry to hear about all your loss Kandee. I know it isn’t easy and I understand why it has been hard to make videos when you’re feeling down and any obstacle feels like a mountain. 
I’m glad you addressed that you’re a private person and you keep a lot to yourself. Unfortunately, one of the reasons I stopped watching your videos so much is because I started to feel that blocked/closed off vibe from you and I wanted to know more about you. I especially want to hear about the hopes and dreams you have because you are an inspiring person to me and I have some pretty crazy out there dreams for myself. Knowing your big dreams would really help me to know that what I want is achievable. I don’t know if that makes sense. Same thing with the relationship status. I’ve been single for a long long long time and there is no shame in that. 
As far as what I would like to see more of from you in terms of videos is back to the basics. I’m here for the makeup tutorials!!! I absolutely adore the step by step makeup application videos. I often find myself going back to your older videos and just watch you create different looks. I love pin up type looks, natural looks, decade looks such as 50s, 60s, 70’s, 80’s, and 90s. I like a little hair, skin care and fashion stuff mixed in. Transformations are always winners. Also some organization type videos would be awesome. How do you organize your life: goals (what steps do you take to reach your goals), how do you organize your thoughts, ideas, and plans, etc? Those are my thoughts. I’m so glad you’re making a comeback Kandee! We’ve missed you! ❤️
You’re amazing <3 you were the first YouTuber I ever followed and I love your energy and aura!! I hope I get to meet you in person one day. You’ve taught me everything I know about makeup lol thank you Kandee!
Ive been watching your videos before anyone became famous.. your videos were so soothing to my soul you taught me how to do my eyeliner even tho i still suck at it but i was brave enough to do many times because of you. If u stopped making videos i don’t know who to watch anymore the little tricks that u taught were so cute. Ive know u long time ago please don’t go we need u.
I love you so much! I've followed you for ten yrs now and I also credit you for my glow-up. Ps I tell ppl were best friends so just be cool if anyone asks ❤️❤️❤️💋💋💋💜💚💚💛❤️💜💙💚💛❤️💜💙💚💛❤️
Take care of yourself Kandee, you are loved!
Dear Kandee Bless and comfort you in your time of grief.  Good for you to stay private as well. I pray the presence of God is near you.  Absent from the body means that we are present with the Lord. Eternal life is found at the cross. Jesus is the way, truth and the life. Blessings and love. Jules
I think it would be pretty cool if you did a series where you would take other makeup artists and y’all would do a transformation challenge (guess kinda like a game show but on YT or even on FB). To start off, it could be you and thealexisstone (IG) could do the first challenge, and its viewers choice (make a poll open for 24hrs) . And you can get other industry makeup artists to judge ( like Lipstick nick, mizjasmid,) or maybe even some celebrities who just love makeup. And then every week y’all would pick one random subscriber to be the 4th judge on the judges panel.
Kandee, you are simply one of the best human beings on this earth!!! I have so much admiration for you. Thank you for sharing yourself with all of us. Please take care of yourself and know that you have many many people who love you and support you in all that you do!!!! XOXOXOXOXO
Nooo Do not Quit!!!!
It's so good to see you again on YouTube. I was just going through my subscriptions a day or two ago and realized you hadn't made a video in a long time. I am so sorry for the loss of your family members. I would love to see any videos you feel like making. Your transformation videos always leave me in awe. You are so talented!
She looks just like Gwen Stefani here
Weekly blog 😍😍😍😍🤗
You’re gorgeous as ever !

You are my hero. I not only admire and respect you but I emulate you as the person you are and aspire to make the difference that you have made and the impact you have had on not just the beauty community but everyone that passes your path. Thank you for being you and being one of the most incredible humans ever.
Love you Kandy! Definitely wanna see your 23 and me video.

I'm so sorry for you and your families. Your pain is valid so please don't apologise for not posting  videos your health is important I remember the first video I watched was your first pinup video with the cute oriental top almost  10 years ago. Your are appreciated and love❤️❤️ love and light Kandee
I adore you ❤️ your a walking angel sent from God
eyebrows could have been better
North said no you’re Kim smh that girl is grown
those eyebrows oh my
the fact that she calls her mom kim is a little weird idk
hahahahah kim looks so concerned with the eyebrows on
I can’t tell if the eyebrows make her look more worried or sad 🤔😂💕 regardless good Job Kandee 💕
Surprise of the day: Kim looks amazing with no brows! #alienperfection
I didn't know Jasmine looked sad or worried all the time
The eyebrows look weird, she looks worried lol
I feel like now that kim is doing makeup videos with people, the makeup artists don’t seem genuine like it just seems like they’re constantly kissing her ass and it’s kind of awkward to watch
The fact that north said-" no, ur really kim" instead of -"no, ur really mom" somehow made me cringe
Literally looks worried with that brow lol
That is NOT how Jasmine's eyebrows look
North was not having it haha
She looks like a chola lol
Why do I have a feeling that Concerned Kim is gonna be the next big meme 😂
Kandee has amazing skills but the picture she selected doesn't really represent Jasmine 95% of the time. LoL!!
Could do without the ass kissing but otherwise good job.
Lmao with the brows on she just looks so concerned 😂😂
8:55 Kim looks so sad omg
“Who figured this out” 
Drag Queens!
Give credit where credit is due girl
I bet kim was cringing inside when she put that glue on her eyebrows. 😂😬
you're very talented, but girl that eyebrow cover...
lol Kim looked miserable after the brows
LMAO she contoured, concealed and did her eyeshadow but NOT with kim's products im shook
why does her own child call her kim? 🤔
Those brows ruined the look for me 😩
ok but why did she give her sad humpty-dumpty eyebrows?
7:55 onwards Kim looks like she's gonna cry
Those brows hurt to look at 😂😂😂
Edit: no hate intended
Her eyebrows 😂
I think it's the eyebrows, but she looks like Nicole Scherzinger now
Damn she butchered this lol
north is kanye's child
Kim should have gone with Promise Tamang instead!!
Kim looking hella worried with those damn eyebrows
When you're crying on the inside smiling on the outside 😑😐
She looks nothing like princess Jasmine
Kandee you got skills girl but those eyebrows....make Kim look permanently worried.
ok but how does a makeup artist do eyebrows that different to eachother
She looks sad lol
OMFG HER EYEBROWS LOOK DEPRESSED AJAHSHHSBDHS
imagine puttin ehlmers glue on kim ks face lmao
Does she looks really sad to anyone else after those eyebrows were drawn ? 😂😂 Soo funny
Why are these makeup artists acting so unnatural and overhyped next to Kim?  I cringed the whole time.
Her brows are crying for help.....
Kim does not look amused😂😂😂
Before she puts on her wig, it looks like a Victor from Corpse Bride makeup tutorial
kim constantly looks concerned now
Princess Jasmine was always one of my favorites too! Such a cute look! So funny they couldn’t fool North. Eyebrows looked a little sad tho.
Kim is not that bad as all youtubers say... She is sweet and a beautiful lady
After the brows were done kim looked worried the rest of the video😂
What is up with the eyebrows
Kim would look just like Jasmine if it wasn't for the "concerned" eyebrows.
you're doing great sweetie
Aww Kim is so cute and I think she makes a beautiful and perfect Jasmine ❤️💁🏻
Kim without eyebrows could make a very cool sci-fy character :o so cool
She made Kim look ugly!  I’m sure she could have done a better Princess Jasmine on Kim!! Kim is so beautiful and look how she did Kim’s brows 🙄
You did her wrong with those eyebrows
Mmm I don’t know I kinda don’t like the eyebrows
Damn north is brutal
I think the brows were made like that to make it look more caricature-like. I liked the whole look & there’s plenty of photos online of princess jasmine making facial expressions with her brows like that lmao
All these makeup tutorials with Kim are super calming... she has a very calming personality
Kim: who came up with this idea?!
Kandee: whoever did is a genius
.. you mean to tell me whoever decided to put G L U E S T I C K directly on their eyebrows was smart? Yeh.. sure
Are you okay, Miss Kandee. I know you had some issues with your kidneys awhile back. I hope you are alright... 💕
Can never look at this chick without seeing her blowing ray Jays CoCk
10:21 Yasss crying Kim back at it again (the phone case)
kim was actually really into crying after her brows HAHAHA
"Your mom is on my magic carpet" 😂
LoVE 💕 ITS KELDOLL I stalked your Twitter 💋🥂
Instead of using glue why don’t you just use hair gel
I'm sorry, but these brows don't give me Princess Jasmine, they give me Kim K with horrible brows & in a Princess Jasmine costume 😭😭😭😭
Love this!!! Amazing job!
You both are so pretty 
Kandee I have that same hat and kimono thing. I wear them together all the time. Xxoo
Keep up with the Jasmines
So disappointed to see this because I think Kim naturally looks like Princess Jasmine and this makeup (esp. those brows oh my lawd), just butchered the entire idea!
Gorgeous ladies 💕Great job girl! Your super talented 👏🏻 I just love your personality Kandee ❤️ Kim is so sweet!!
Kim is so gorgeous and Kandee made her look weird which I never knew was possible
I agree with all the people complaining that the eyebrows were bad. But the people defending the brows saying “she’s supposed to be a cartoon character of course they look like that!” are really mad but don’t get what most of us mean. We’re not complaining because the eyebrow look is bold and cartoony, because of course that what the picture portrays Jasmine as, but we are conplaining because Kandee chose a bad reference picture to go off of. Jasmine in that particular scene looked worried, but her eyebrows don’t look like that throughout the majority of the movie. When you google a picture of Princess Jasmine, you can find pictures of her in different parts of the movie with her eyebrows looking more normal and less “worried”. The eyebrows Kandee painted made Kim look too expressive and sad/worried, but Jasmine isn’t like that throughout the whole movie and that’s why it mostly ruined the look.
“Rajah’s pooping and I have to go clean it up” 😂😂😂😂
omg i loveit.. great job Kandee!! and she does always seem so sweet and genuine. and whew,, she is SO BEAUTIFUL.
Hmmm I mean this in the nicest way possible...The eyebrows are not happy...LOL I thought kim was about to cry.
Shoulda made her Pocahontas instead
that was a bust! You did a great job! the eyebrows do make her look worried!
“Youre really Kim” Ahahahah
U turned her into cardi b if anything w that face
It’s a no for me. 🙅🏼‍♂️🙅🏽‍♀️
Lander: Were using the RCM contour
Kim face triggers because not kkw beauty
Jasmine: FAV DISNEY PRINCESS EVEEEEEER!!!!!!
Even when she smiles she still looks concerned 😧
Literally did not know this was Kim. Such a great job.
I actually love how Kim's not obnoxious, shes chill and doesn't say much.
BEN NYE THE MAKEUP GUY
So so cool!!!! Kandee, thank you for being so unique and just incredible!!❤️
North knows her mum too well
Kim looks a lot like Veronica's mom from riverdale here
the eyebrows are kinda horrible lol
Princess Jasmine Earrings and Necklace (made by the amazing cosplay costume creator):
 

wHO???? XD
i love how pretty Kim looked ❤️
This is so perfect! You did an amazing job!!
she uses inspro subtly 👌🏼
She don’t loo anything like her tho💀🤦🏽‍♀️
Fabulous, loved it! Great job kandee ❤
"I can honestly say I had the best childhood"

Thats no affense at all nur kim would made a beautiful alienwomen she has the perfect face structure for it😍😍
Loved you two together
You are bloody kim 😂😂north said
How cute is Kim talking to North on the phone!?!
Her kid has a cell already....really....I dont know why I'm so shocked..but really shes like 4?? And why is she calling her mom Kim..instead of...oh idk...mom...
She looks concerned! 😂🤣😂🤣😂 Like where is my man Aladdin?
Tbh ...she looks a hot mess💀
LOL KIM KARDASHIAN AS JASMINE LOL!!!!Best Vid Ever!
Tbh i wouldn't even know it was Kim
The brows immediately make her look sad I can't believe how much power the brow has!! 💓
Kim: "I also love Belle. I know every single word in the movie."
Me: AAAAAAALRRIGHHHHTTYYYY THEN.
Minus the brows, Kim looks good. Good job!
I havent. Watched you  in years i am so sorr y i forgot abou t you
"I turn around and it's smudgy side eyes" Like if you know where that's from
At 5:47 Did she really just say that she took off some of Kim's real eyebrow hair?! LOL Wow....Kim looks so bothered tbh
It's hard finding all the different ways to thank someone for calling you beautiful.
Her unblended contour made me so uncomfortable the whole time
Kim was such a good sport. It is nice to see how Kim acts outside her show. I always enjoy your videos, Kandee.💗
wheezes the entire time out of laughter duuuuuuude
So much is happening. I can't keep up
Please make more videos!!! Where did you go?!?
love this Kim the perfect Princess Jasmine 🔥🎻🤗👑
That has to be the most expressive I've ever seen Kim's facial expressions
We miss you! Hope you are doing well. ❤
kim was pretty funny here~ "i have to check on my tiger, rajah is pooping  ahead.." lol
omg she doesn't even look like Kim after the makeup look
Did Kandee style this wig?! It's amazing! P.S. I need Kandee's manager to help me! I want big gigs like these! So fun!
Love from Poland 🇵🇱 from Agnes (Aga Grzelak) fans! Thanks for Your beautiful words on her VidCon vlog ❤🇵🇱❤🇵🇱
Love the transformation! 😍 but kim looks a little sad with the eyebrows
For how famous Kim is, it doesn’t seem like she should be on a YouTube channel, no matter how big or small 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Those brows need to go on a magic carpet ride!!!!
They're a NO from mee.
you just put Elmer's glue on KK's eyebrows... the queen of the eyebrow look. I mean, you are now legend Kandee. (Also, why was I not invited? My name starts with a K too!! 😭)
Promise Phan should transform Kim next 😂
Kim looks so beautiful as Jasmine. Awesome job! Love the uniqueness on this.
Don’t understand the eyebrows
This is horrible. OMG! I've never seen you mess up a look. KKW is such a good sport 😂
kim calling her daughter was TOO ADORABLE!!!
Actually I dont know Kandee Johnson but when I looked at the trending ,I saw this at when I watched this I was actually amazed <3
how can you hate KK? she's so polite & funny
kim looks so sad immediately after the eyebrows go on hahahaha
Brows are EXCELLENT, I now know how to hide my thick brows THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
OMG!!! Kandee Johnson Your Amazing!!! She Does Really, Look Like Jasmine 😊 I'm Shocked 😮!!!! 😘Love You Girl 😘
FUUUCKED UP EYEBROWS😲
You made Kim look beautiful:)
Rajah is pooping? 🤣🤣🤣
This is amazing, I loved it.
Amazing transformation 😍😍
Gurl her eyebrows ain't even 😂😂😂
the eyebrows had me shister sHoOk lOl
Jasmine ft. Tim Burton Brows
jasmine looks worried
Warning: Semi long post😂
Last night I had I dream that I met Kim and I started crying and she hugged me 🆒😂😂😂😂🆒
"Shes our best jasmine" lol bye
Your smile is beautiful... just saying... when you smile , u look amazing!
Im dying laughing after the brows were done, just how worried she looks hahahaha😂😂😂
She was trying to impress and compliment Kim so much 😂😂
I wish there was a “love” button
itS jaSmInE
north was so over it hahahaha
You made her look beautiful!!
Can you imagine being jasmine for a day? Beautiful
I'm sorry Girl, I adore you. You Inspire me...
But the Eyebrows are not OK. 😂😂😂😂
She's looks like drepressed Jasmyne. :(
This is amazing ahhaha I love this
She looks great but kinda strange as Jasmine haha
Kim looks so so good as jasmine. I have seen this video several times and I'm obsessed with this look.
"She's on my magic carpet, she's on her way home" lol Kim. and amazing job on the transformation Kandee 💗
Omg from the thumbnail I didn’t even know it’s was Kim on the right WOW
I loved it! 

Everyone who doesn’t understand her method, Kandee is known for extreme transformation to look like the actual illustration. Not a real life “inspiration”. And she chose the image that Jasmine has that cute concerned look, and nailed it.
I love this video!!! I couldn't stop laughing after she was done with the brows!!😂😂😂
North was not fooled 😂
Kim’s princess jasmine voice was hurt 😂😂😂😂
BAHAHAHAHAHA 😂😂💀💀
The character is a cartoon, therefore the brows are cartoonish! Duuuh!
8:02 kim is worried about something
How in the world did she collaborate with Kim Kardashian
one question... ¿WHY DID U DO HER EYEBROWS THAT WAY? :(
Not feeling the eyebrows but overall gorgeous!
Yas!!!! This is on Trending Kandee Johnson !!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
when ever emily from pll has a concerned look they it looks just like kim as jasmine
The music sounds like the one from kingdom hearts, btw Kim makes a great jasmine!
Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.
He also promised to heal your body.
This Is True Love!!!  (Just ask Him)
Kim Kimble! Love you! Chi town!
OMG GIRL YOURE SO FREAKIN CLOSE TO 4 MIL!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Kim is so calm and accepting and not to mention absolutely GORGEOUS 😍
Cause Kim aint PERFECT already, WOW!!!
That was everything 😂❤️
I'm dying over the eyebrows 😂
Jasine's eyebrows are NOT like that but good job with everything else :)
The transformation is on point. I love what you did with the eyebrows. Its called being creative. Thinking outside of the box. More people should try it. Congrats on your trending video! I am not at all surprised that you made a connection with Kim. You both encompass beautiful souls, and impeccable work ethic.
I was so happy for Kim to do jasmine but ugh those eyebrows👎🏼
omg her phone case is ICONIC
How Kim doesn’t have iPhone X did some one notice or is it just me 
Maybe it’s on of her phones lol
Wow amazing work once again Kandee! Loved your looks FOREVER!
Those brows, she looks awkward and scared
Love the transformation. So fun! And the eyebrows DO look like Jasmine's. Great job Kandee! :)
Enjoyed this video, great job with the eyebrows! I'm sure most hands would have been shaky while doing KimK's Makeup !!!
Whatever you do: DO NOT look up the voice of Jasmine... it will ruin your childhood 😱😭😭
When I was North's age, I only knew that my Mom was called mom and didn't know her actual name until I was 6 😂😂
Omg!!! Ms Kandee!!! You got to work your magic on kim kardashian! I've been watxhing you for years! This must have been fun! And a bit intimidating! But you you did a beautiful job as always!
Kim is adorable, can I adopt her?! Perfect Jasmine
Love love love the outcome with such a SHORT amount of time!!! <3 <3 <3 GREAT job Kandee!!
Hahaha “No... you’re really Kim.” North keeping her mom in reality 😂💕
Aww haha Kim seems so kind and genuine in this video, her little FaceTime with north just warmed my heart, the Princess jasmine jumped out sis
Never yell "Hi Jack!", in the airport.
Great video Kandee.I love kim and she is so good.Nice work by the way...😍😍😍😍Never expected this kinda video.I'm really surprised....!
Great job except the eye brows shoulda been at a regular angle.  She lookin hella confused.
We miss youu! I want to see more transformation videos!
You did such a good job, Kandee! When I first saw Kim, I couldnt tell it was her! You two are so funny, and and really look up to you, Kandee!
I truely couldn't see Kim Kardashian  in that jasmine make,up and clothing
I love this, looks absolutely amazing just like jasmine
Kandee calling kim pretty for 5 minutes straight.
The way Kim sat with her arms directly on her side kind of made it look like she has 3 boob cracks haha
“Kim Kardashian looking worried for 10 minutes straight”
Gdi i really need kandee to blend out that contour on kim's jaw.
Someone please make a meme with kim with the no eyebrows lmao
okay this was incredible!!
I love how just this kind act made a lil girls day 😍😍😍😍😍 this why I love you so much your such a good person your my favorite make up artist 😍😍😍😍
I was not convinced this was kim until you started the transformation. lol
This is weirdly satisfying to watch 🤗
This is like one of the rare times a celebrity is comfortable with a YouTuber
Kim K looks Hella perplexed 🤔
But...but..she’s always been Jaffar!
Kulture voulture as always
Absolutely love this!!!
Next, I wanna see Kim as Cleopatra
would not have known that was kim k oh my gosh! great job!
Ethnic ambiguity goals
OMG THE EYEBROWS JAJAJA
Let’s be real, neither Kim nor Jasmine would EVER actually pick up their pets poop. They’d have someone to do that for them 😂
Kim was shook when there was glue in her brows 😂
The brows made Kim look very concerned for the rest of the tutorial
Those eyebrows though! 😖
Those brows look crazy
More like jasmine got slapped
i already know that kim k without eyebrows is going to be a meme
Not digging the brows 🤔
I'm excited for the "beauty guru does this for _ minutes" videos for this video
We all know that just Jade can be Princess Jasmine
YES MY FAVORITE PRINCESS IS JASMINE 😭
You are doing amazing sweetie, why that worried face?
Jasmine's eyebrows tho! 😂 😂
It's reaally kim k ?🤔😲
Kim looks pretty, the look is pretty.. But literally I cannot stop laughing.. Kim's whole facial expression has changed, and I just cannot get enough 😂
This is the most unique hooker y...  Like best look iv seen her wear closest to natural.
i literally couldn’t take kim serious bc of those brows 😂😂
could we not have had different brows
Those brows have Kim looking so fu*ckin worried😯😯
Did anyone else notice Kim's phone case?!?!? 😂😂 I died when I saw it
TWO SUPER GORGEOUS BABES
I always thought that Kim looked like Jasmine but them brows tho
the Kardashian’s make it seem like it takes so much energy to talk
Kim's phone case 😂
Botox Jasmin 😂
Great job Kandee!  You always do the best looks!!!
you could literally stab someone with her left eyebrow
this is really good. Kandee, you're a very talented artist and you're just awesome.
Kim perfectly fit for  Jasmine, maybe she was in previous life
..what makeup artist is that whi cant drawing some eyebrows ...reap jamine eyebrows
Kim you are such a good sport!!! Love you.
Beautiful princess🧞‍♀️👸🏽
That is amazing work.
Why are her eyebrows crying
You did an amazing job!!
Was about to say Clickbait, but that's ACTUALLY the Real Kim K (Not a look a like) Like RiceGum does
Those eyebrows are a nightmare. Everything else is great👍🏾
Kim is a mood😂😂💕
i'm dying of kim's phone case😂
She looks like Gabriel Jesus.
Well her product doesn’t work to the expectations
I never noticed how goregouse her neck is ...so proportional lol
It's the first time I see a video with Kim and I hear her voice, well it's very sweet!
A shishtar is shook
7:46 when he buys you food without you asking
i love how kim’s case is her own meme
This was so sloppy
Those brows are a mess haha. Jasmine has rounded brows with an arch, not question marks. The rest looks great though.
I can hardly tell it's Kim anymore!! That's so crazy. You did such a wonderful job with the makeup Kandee!! And the hair and accessories are so spot on!!!
she looks so sad 🤣🤣🤣
cosplay on point.....
Kim literally is jasmine
North is Kims biggest critic lol
When she put glue on Kim and Kim said who figured that out that's what I want to know!!? I laughed so hard😂💋
Nah, shes still not cute! They tried though. #cbf4life
amazing!!❤️
Kim is ready to join a bevy of Drag Queens on a Drag parade 😂
I love that north calls her mom “kim”
Lol, North😂
hahaha I agree with North
This is awesome
For your next video can you make Harley Quinn
The contour on the left side of Kim’s face seems unblended.
I was cringing cause she never used any KKW Beauty things on Kim...awkward
she could be the cast????? no?>?>?>?>?
Damnnn north no words 😂😂😂
nobody else noticed her phone case? 😂
Time to make the new Aladdin movie now in real life version, 2018 staring Kim Kardashian
Jasmine is my fav princess to
The eyebrows are definitely not on fleek!
U ask me when im fine but im not
Love, love, love!! I love you and Kim and this video was everything! 😚
"I don't even know what she sounds like", that just says it all really!
My mom named me after jasmine 😂
Honestly I believe Kim Kardashian has a magic carpet
Damn north is brutal
Kim looked so sad once the eyebrows were done! LOL :(
promise phan's is better...
really those eyebrows😒😒😒!
What a cool collaboration that turned out so realistic!
This is amazballs!!
Looks like she wants to burst into tears any moment 😂
“you’re really kim”
She looks sad or confused 😂
kandee should of pranked her tell her she will be doing jasmine but instead turn her into Jafar lol
Sooo good!! I had a good laugh tough😂
Oh shoot, she's like Jasmines copy
1.The hair is a little too big
2.The eyebrows make her look sad lol
Why u call her jasmine not Yasmin it's not difficult to say it
Lmao what is this 😂😭🤣
I am huge Kim Kardashian fan
Kim looks so cute with theses eye brows!!! I️ live
Kandee putting glue in Kim's eyebrows is everything!!🙃
I love this! Great job Kandee!
The ultimate transformation 🙌 So much talent Kandee!
This transformation was awesome but I bet Kim was lowkey wondering why Kandee didn’t use her contour/ concealer lol
What the hell was her reference photo???
I feel so bad for kim she looks so cute and sad with these eyebrows 😍😂like shes gonna cry 😭😭love it though!!
How about khloe k as majimbu from dragon ball that would be interesting 🤣
She actually looks good with no brows. Her face is so perfect she can be bald and have no eyebrows and still look amazing.
I died when she put her arm around her with her hair at the beginning lol 😂
I cannot believe this won a Streamy over Shane and Molly’s collaboration
Kim's phone case 😂
I can see the memes already 😂😂
Not a fan of kim or the kardashians but she really seems like a nice polite person. And really good job Kandee👌🏻👍🏻
It ruined my childhood.Terrible woman like Kim is transformed into such a sweet and loving person like Jasmine 😥 ? KIM is not like her at all.
Girl those brows. Kim looks scared. I'm scared. Lol!!
I wonder what Kim’s make up artist, Mario, thought about this look...
she's so beautiful!! the eye brows makes her look sad tho. maybe becoz there's no Aladdin.
She lie. There’s def some contour lol 🤣😑
Those eyebrows look like Ariana grande, she always looks worried lol. But I love this tutorial!!
Her eyebrows look like victor from the corpse bride😂😂✋
Love kim btw❤👑
Reminder: The West family supports Trump.
Waiting for Kandee Johnson annoying Kim Kardashian for 2 minutes video
Jasmine's brows don't look like that in my opinion ,but the look was amazing couldn't even recognize that was Kim in the end
Omg Kim Kimble and Kim together. Day made. Kandee did a great job! Cartoon characters aren't easy!
I think she did her dirty with the eyebrows. Jasmine doesn’t walk around with concerned eyebrows all the time. 😂 she should of did a rounder brow.
She dosen't look like jasmine, she would've done better with cinderella or snowwhite but I still love you kim ❤
Kim looks so sad and confused because of the brows😂😂
Ever have a makeup artist with bad breath? My nightmare😂
Im here because of kandee I've been following her since always
her brows look just like a pic of jasmine.... that shows how talented kandee is!!! quit being lame and be nice!!!
Isn’t jasmine supposed to be headstrong...and not constantly worried.
Girl those eyebrows destroyed it
Who else thinks that some people are gonna make a Kandee Johnson annoying Kim Kardashian for 10 minutes video 😂💀
Kim looks so worried with those eyebrows😂
Damn where did Kim’s personality go?
Okay but I would really watch a video of Kim saying the whole beauty and the beast script..
I used to hate kim but this made me see that she's not that bad
Can you turn yourself into handsome squidward?!
Everything was nice ....I just am not feeling those eyebrows 😂😬
Google the name Verona Pooth! She is absolutely looking like her! Crazy.
Jasmine is one of my favs! What a fun video!!!! Good job!!
She could play the movie ALADDIN 2019 as jasmine LIKE IF U AGREE!!!
I LOVE HOW NORTH CALLS HER KIM
I already know someone is making a "Kim K being annoyed for 10 minutes straight" 😭😂😂 off of this
You did Kim so dirty with this look
This one is no bueno 😩
Kim’s phone case
Once the eyebrows were on mom looked so sad 😂😟
y'all remember when kim looked like jafar ? she should of went for that look lol
I love her like this. She seems so different!!
omg her phone case, we love a meme queen
That brow cover was pretty rough tbh
Keeping up with the eyebrows
She looks like jafar rather than Jasmin
omg when kim was talking to north it was the cutest thing
I couldn't take kim seriously, with them eyebrows lmao
The real princess Jasmine still look better
Someone needs to do 5 minutes of kandee complimenting kim
Is it my eyes or is there a heavy filter on this video?
Even when Kim doesn’t have eyebrows, she is still so beautiful!
Damn that wig is bigger than my futur 😂😂😂
Kim looked like she wanted to run away lol. Shes such a team player.
arches of destiny
Yo conozco gente que se pinta las cejas igualito!
What? Princess Jasmine is not real??? Oh nooooo... 😊
Why does Kim look like Danielle Cohn😂lol
My name Jasmine
Kim just looks worried with those eyebrows 😂
is it the same woman who once claimed to break the internet by her ass and who's husband had a melt down during a live show?
Her phone case 😂
love ya!
BAHAHAHAHAAJA
8:00 Kim kinda looks like she about to cry
Kim looked pissed lol
THE BROWS THO W H Y???!!!! SHE LOOKS SAD!!
the eyebrows...? Why
this is a disaster
she looks worried
Are we not going to talk about her freaking phone case....
Dear lovely miss Kandee, it would make my life complete if you would turn James Charles into Brendon Urie!! Cuz when he let's his beard grow it'd be so similar from the start 😅😅
Kim looks so sad 😂
Very talented! Good job! 💖💖
Happy birthday to us!
Jasmines eyebrows were not like that lol
Kim looks so disappointed in the thumbnail lmao 😆😆😆
Do a makeup on Kendall Jenner
We miss you kandee!!!! 🙏♥️☺️
OMG I LOVE KIM K
It looks great! Not meant to be an everyday look. I actually like tge eyebrows. It gives the look character!
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO HER BROWS
Moana would have also been A good princess to do on her
4:36 "I hope my kids have that" well that's just sweet
i love youuuuuu kim
She looks EXACTLY like jerffery star without eyebrows
Ok.. call you in a bit!!  So funny🤣
Kim looks so miserable. Why?
Those eyebrows makes her look really sad or literally about to cry 😂
Spectacular!
please post a new video ur my fav youtuber and ive been checking everyday for a while and im missing ur funny videos u should do another beauty news and reviews
Her eyes are uneven
Kim is so gorgeous 😍
but isn't it kinda weird how North was referring to her as "Kim" instead of "Mom" lol
You probably shoulda used a different reference photo
after the eyebrows, she looked so concerned the whole video😭😭
اذا طلبت ياسمين من جولي شيك:
Can you make me look like sleeping beauty!!!??? Or belle
2:40 kim in head: i have no idea where this is going
kadee is genius and with the brows wow!
That's amazing!
everything but the eyebrows bro
you did a great job! but those eyebrows .. are okay
If you slow this video down as slow as it goes it's hilarious!!!!! Lmao. I'm easily amused.
North is so cute aww
Kandee did Kim so wrong omg LMAO
damn kim is a hot Jasmine!!!
Amazing!!!
Omg Kim looks so sad with the eyebrows
This is SUPER cute but WHY HER BROWS LIKE THT
north has a phone
Love this!
Those brows make Kim look so vexed. 😂
Jaclyn Hill is quaking
oh my god the cringe
Once the first eyebrow was drawn on thats literally all i could concentrate on
those brows got to me
Kim looks kinda triggered when she said you need flawless skin to be a princess
This is actually really cute
"Damn I had the most fun fu*king when I was little"- said Kim Kardashian
Works for me
This transformation is insane.
Looks spot on!
8:54 awww kim is sad 😂
I like this video,and I think Kandee did  a wonderful job, Pay no mind to the negative comments !
Culture vulture
Kim's should make audiobooks for me to sleep to... Her voice is so soothing
Lol rajah is pooping haha
She said my name.. 😝 shout out to the jasmine’s out there huntyyyyy!😂👌🏼
I wish that there was a blooper of Kim singing 'A Whole New World'
I kind of like the brows, it softens up Kim's overall expression.
The background music is calming AF.
Hold on this video was posted tomorrow
why does Kim K look more jasmine than jasmine
She's my fav too. My friends would say I reminded them of Princess Jasmine...
Only difference is Jasmine didnt talk all squeeky and wasn't a stuck up bi××h
omg, Kim a really beautiful woman and she really looks like Jazmin but jezzz! what is wrong with the browns? Jazmín don't even look like that
Less than a minot in and I'm annoyed that she did the base before glueing the brows ahhhh
Just saying, Kim doesn't look truly happy in life so it shows.Jasmine is a cartoon character that shows whatever emotions we want her to.Still,Kim is beautiful...
Great job kandee! And kim im not suprised that north recognized you i mean you are mama bear afterall. Belle next plz!!!!! With a gown!
Happy birthday!!🎂🎉
aye when you glue the brows comb them in one direction with a comb or old mascara wand then set them when they dry, it covers them a lot more better, with the loose powder it will dry all the glue and it mashes it all together giving it a smoother look and you won't need to use as much product, but make sure to use pressure when setting them.❤
I bet Kim was cringing everytime kandy mentions every single product she owns but a different brand
Honestly the eyebrows... Ouch Princess Jasmine doesnt have sad eyebrows all the time.
I saw better Make Up transformations
The eyebrows, no hunny
im shooook!
Kim makes the worst jasmine of lol time sorry kandee I love you but Kim is NOT jasmine
Kandee! My god your talent is out of this world!! You are just so amazing, you were the first MUA/Youtuber I ever started following, and you're still killing the game! Kim looks amazing at Princess Jasmine, my fave!! <3 <3
She actually looks very much like her!
Hi kandee I'm so proud of you from my heart. I just watched the video you filmed in 2011 and said their were some haters and judgmental people affect you the way you are, I'm so glad for you didn't gave up your makeup dream. Look how awesome you are now!
The tiger is pooping ! Hahaha !!!!
Those eyebrows dont really look like jasmine
She messed up the eyebrows.
Kandee your so sweet I love you. Amazing make up tutorials and I love Kim. You both are so sweet lovely personalities.
She actually does sound like Jasmine though 😂
Jasmine was my favourite Disney princess when I was little! haha You did an amazing job Kandee! I think that in the honor of my younger self, I'll have to try this look as well!!! XDDD
That phone call waz the best !! So sweet
I feel like those eyebrows will become a meme 😂
She looks like Ines Brasil dressed as Jasmine
I love this! North is hilarious, she's not having any of it!
Love that I started out watching Kandee teaching us how to wash makeup brushed in the bathroom sink and now we’re here 💕 💯
She looks sad AF.
When I first saw Kim k on tv I also thought she looked like Jasmine.... I wasn’t digging the eyebrows though.
Kim looks so incredible woah
Kim looks high fashion af with no eyebrows
I think jasmine only had her eyebrows in that "kind-worry" look in that picture/scene. Her eyebrows in all other pictures are actually arched lmao her concerned face makes it hard to take this seriously
Is it just me, or does the eyebrows make Kim look sad. The look is still amazing though ♥
The eyes brows made Kim look so worried the entire 2nd half of the video
The brows just a shade too dark, a pinch too high and tiny too thick. But very close though!
I love everything except the brows
whats with the basic ass effort with the winged liner and smokey? I know this is character makeup but COME ON....  definite let down poor kim lol
Nahhhh this look is horrible, those brows look stupid as hell and princess Jasmine doesn't even have brows like that 😂😂😂
awww this is so cute
Those eyebrows killin me naaaaaaa
kandee should be the one doing the makeup for the Aladin the Broadway show
Kim is adorable and I don't care what anyone says.
Aww Haha such a savage 4 year old
Kim just looks annoyed the entire time
You are such an artist
💛💛💛💛
She looks constipated with those eyebrows lol
Her eyebrows didn’t need to go up like that her face is jasmine enough
This is terrible lmfao I’m so over it 🤣😂
Now that's artistic
Kim looked like she was cringing sm the whole time
what was your best make up tip? when I learned how to bake uh what
lol her phone case is her crying meme
I like the no brow look 😅
#lovin.it
https://youtu.be/wLUiYpnRlt4
You look at this and tell me there is a God
kim's phone case !! lol
SwooZie would be proud.
6:28 Kim looks lie, lady gaga
i'm so stress that she looks damn confused
the eyebrows make kim look scared
Jasmine Piawn
Drag queens, Kandee. Drag queens popularized the glue stick trick.
She looks so sad 🙁
Imagine kim with no brows haha
hahaha I looked at other pictures and Jasmine’s eyebrows don’t always look like that
She looked like jasmine before she changed her nose.
Uhmm heyy you guys, kim is so pretty,  especially in her younger days 😍😍
So bad 😂😂😂😂 wow
the eyebrows kinda were hmmmmm. not for me but i appreciate going for cartoon.
It's probably because I'm baked as hell, but Kim without eyebrows has me in stitches.
I peep Kim Kimble
Why does she look so sad? HAHAHA
This was really bad
The lip colour is way off.
kkw beauty ????? jajaja lol
Nahhh. I can’t be the only one bothered by how muddy the jawline and forehead look :/
Kim looks gorgeous!
Kandee you did such a great job!!! I love!!!
oh my goodness i love kim’s phone case
should’ve just kept her face and features and slapped the wig and accessories on her
U shady for those brows
Kim looks like she’s about to burst into tears 😂
Jasmine's eyebrows do not look like that
The eyebrows are a no for me. Jasmines def didnt look like that
lmao kims phone case
Hey it's Poppy
really? I can't recognize her!!! wow
My name is Jasmine !!
She doesn't look even like kim
I should call Kim Kardashian the next power ranger just because her face has morph over the years so many time.
jasmine in her menopausal
I cannot believe Kandee did Kim Kardashian West like that....... throw the whole woman away
Kim Kardashian is a dush bag
10:21
kim looked like she was ready to cry with them eyebrows
Those eyebrows tho,  not feeling it
She actually is so sweet!
Kim really does seem like a sweet person :)
those brows look crazy lmao
i love kim so much she’s so nice but she looks constipated at 8:39
Oh no baby WHAT is you doin?!
Wonderful! 😍
Is it just me or does Kandee sound like Rebeca Zamolo
Happy 40th birthday, Kandee!  U don't even look 40.
She resembles the Crime Watch lady.  Same eyebrows.
Jasmine is my favorite princess too!!!💯💯💯
She does not look like princess jaz omg
Why is this Jasmine sad?
She looks so sad after the eyebrows😂😂
Kim looks like Nicole Scherzinger with weird eyebrows
She looks like a totally different person at the end
I can't believe that's kim
The eyebrows make her look worried
Kandee you’re so talented..I love the eyebrows personally because otherwise it’s just a typical Disney princess without any expression! Rude people need to move on and get over it
She does not really resemble jasmine. The hair is kinda huge. But the makeup is quite good.
They did her dirty 😂😂
the way Kim says "it's Princess Jasmine" when on the phone to North really sounds like when Scott did those prank calls saying "It's me, Todd Kraines!" haha
I love Kandee but this was really bad, I could have done this lol. I think you should leave the transformations to Dope2111
remember when kim looked like jafar
Before the rest of the makeup, earrings and wig she looks SO sad. 🤣
They did her so dirty with those eyebrows 👀
You got cartoon Jasmine on point.  Jasmines eye brows had some attitude even when sweet, so they wouldn’t have been twins. Also if Kim is hanging out with Kandee then Kim must be a great person, Kandee doesn’t surround herself with bad people. I’m such a disney fan, I got this right away. All the non Disney people just can’t understand the cute. 🙌🏻🙌🏻
That’s a sad Jasmine! 😔
You should have used more than one reference photo for Jasmine. Her eyebrows don't always look like that, only when she makes certain expressions. Her eyeshadow is also more beige/golden/brown. This could have been so much better.
I get the pressure of working with someone like her, but this was kinda cringy. Trying so hard to not annoy her and all the asskissing was out of this world awkward. But Kim remained nice the whole time so there’s that. This would have been a lovely video if only you chilled out a little.
Omg that dosent look kim wow amazing
I can’t get over her looking so worried with those brows 😂🙈
new eyebrow trend: worried brows
Come through with the collabo Kandee!!!!!
Kim wanted to laugh so bad after seeing those eyebrows😂
Kandee, I don’t know if you will see this but I really just wanted you to know how much I really love and appreciate you! I follow you on Snapchat and you are so amazing and encouraging. Sometimes your encouraging videos bring me to tears because they mean so much to me. I absolutely love you! You are so amazing. Please don’t stop being a great influence of people❤️
Kandee acts the same around everyone. I love it 💕
Those brows killed the immersion.
I wish they gave Kim natural Jasmine eyebrows if I'm being honest I remember Kim's Halloween outfit for Princess Jasmine ws Gorgeous especially her Mermaid costume
Tag yourself...I’m the eyebrows
Nope.. Kandee fail this time.. 1.- chose the wrong jasmine picture. 2.- kim did not look cute at the end. If she wanted kim to look funny then yeah, goal acomplished!.
North was right af
Will u do poppy from trolls makeup and costume 😄 kandee
The eyebrows 😂😂😂
Haha she looks like jasmine so much!!!
Not those brows plz
lol did she use any of kims makeup in this video?
She look fab without eyebrows
those eyebrows though
This girl reminds me of Chrissy Teigen
Kim's phone case is hilarious .
Kim look cute
Those eyerbrows OMG 😂😂😂😂
Not trying to be negative but why couldn’t you just make her a pretty version of prices jasmine🤔? This is the worst I’ve ever seen Kim. Like the brows are just out of pocket
Omg couldn't stop laughing at the brow shape on Kim, you did an amazing job recreating this look 😍 so talented 🙌
"You're kim" not even "mom" ??? Hmm. Weird lol
kim without eyebrows :0
kim’s face jajajajajjajajajajajajajaj
Really gorgeous alien from the planet beautiful. So cringey 🤢🤮
The whole time I'm watching this I can't help but think Kim is sad cuz of those eyebrows!😂😂😂
Jasmine looks sad. But I get it.
She looks like that she's worrying about something 😂
Why do the brows like that? Jasmine has a range of expressions lol
Lol what princess doesnt know her own tigers name! Nice try kim
shes so pretty
kim is sooooooo kind omg, i love her!
Wauw ITS BEAUTIFULLLL!! 😍😍
Those eye brows SUCKKKKK😂
Same bday as meeee
Kim looks nice now hahaha
Kim dose look like princess jasmine
Her eyebrows make her look so vulnerable omg
Damn kandee loves to kiss booty 🤣
Love it!!
She did Kim dirty with those brows
So cute.😍
The eyebrows ruined it... :O
2:15 DRAG QUEENS HONEY
1:12
maam, how dare u call that a look
Those eyebrows made her look soooooo sad!!
she still look good without eyebrows 😭😭😭😍
why are you doing her eyebrows look so sad ?  her natural eyebrows are more beautiful  than this 😂😂
KIM IF YOU EVER DO A HALLOWEEN TRANSFORMATION GO TO DOPE2111 INSTEAD 
Love you Kandee but dope2111 hits the nail on alllll her transformations. Like scary precise
The problems with the eyebrows is that Jasmine is being much more expressive when her brows look like this. KK isn’t emotive enough for the expressive brows. The regular arched brows would have made her look much more like like Jasmine.
Wow she really looks like Jasmine. Love it. Kandee you did an amazing job love.
Those eyebrows though... I mean I remember Jasmine having worried expressions but not the whole time
She looks better as Jasmine! LOL
Anyone notice Kim’s phone case 😂😂😂😂😂
KIM KIMBLE ❤️❤️❤️
she look like the old kim k bfore famous ❤
her one eyebrow looks snagged
Those eyebrows had me 💀😂
Great job Kandee, you're so talented, hun!!
Expecting a video of "Kandee Johnson annoying Kim Kardahsian for 3 minutes straight"  😂
....... those brows though.
Ughhh this makes me miss my very good friend Princess Jasmine so much :( literally that's almost exactly how we'd do our makeup
But...Jasmine's eyebrows aren't even like that 90% of the time. What made you do them like that expression?
WTF Kim k???? I thought kandee was turning herself into jasmine and into Kim all in one video at first!
When are ppl gonna be over this family especially since they proved they hire there own paparazzi and crop pics for bigger & younger looking butts they did horrible on live tv they have to have it scripted
The OG of youtube ❤
Came to watch this after I saw the meme
Kim reeeaaaally didnt look like she liked the look XD
does north have her own iphone? at 4??
That looks awful. I couldn't hardly watch.
I cannot get over those brows
the eye brows....
bye bye brows
Is it bad that I like her better with that look
I love this video
Yo they better not make her the new Jasmine.
when just the eyebrows were done she literally looks ridiculous
I love you Kandee! You are crazy talented!!!!!
Those brows r jank
99% comments about those eyebrows 😂😂😂
"Your really Kim" 
-North 2k18 🤣🖤
Can someone please tell me why there are people who hate  her? Because she seems okay to me 🤷🏻‍♀️
this is the most expressive I've seen kim
north west being like kanye 💀
hey everyone, would mind checking out my cover of TOO GOOD AT GOOBYES?💖💗 thanks so much if you will spend your time for me❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
This is bad lmao yo wtf
I bet there are gonna be like 20 videos titled " Kandee Johnson annoying Kim Kardashian for 10 minutes . "
Why is her daughter calling her Kim 😫😞
awe thank you
Lmao have y’all seen her phone case
It doesn’t even look like the same person
That kiss up though
The brows oh no
is it weird that i think she actually looks a lot more like Kendall with no eyebrows? LOL
I loved this she’s a good mum
Well they do say kids tell the truth..
Oh my gosh i love kim with these eyebrows! Seriously she should do asmr
Those eyebrows have two arches
hahahahaa them brows tho
kim doesn't know how to act
They forgot her mole by her upper lip
Stop kissing her butt lol
I think she suddelny looks like Nicole Scherzinger :D
Jasmine eyebrows give me anxiety
Kim is the best mom
How comes that north calls her mom by her name?
Can you please do a skincare video for mature skin
When she contours the Mona Lisa 😂😂
Maybe how to brighten the eyes for people over 30 ( More concealer makes things more creased and cake like at this age). Or how to do a pigmented/ cut crease eye look for hooded eyes.
Very pretty but I wonder what this looks like in person without the lighting.
But...your forehead just looks dirty......
I've missed your tutorials Kandee !!! love you!!
I’ve been loving you on Glam Masters, you’ve kept your great personality while judging others.
That was a cool intro😂🍫🍬🍭
I've used this foundation before and it oxidized so much darker where I looked orange. I have no clue what you're talking about when u said "don't worry if it looks darker when u first put it on because it will lighten up over time as it warms up from being on your skin". U said that a few times in the video...has anyone ever had a foundation oxidize and then become lighter?....One of the biggest complaints, if not the biggest complaint about this specific foundation is it oxidizing sooo much darker..
LOL the beginning was funny like those commercials with the OH NO/SHOCKING FACE LOL😅😰💖🍭🍬
i LOVE IT!!!!!! i would have loved to have seen this pretty makeup up look with it! I would love a video of an Erika Jayne makeup look!!! You are absolutely BEAUTIFUL Kandee!!!!!! BEAUTIFUL!!!
I love seeing you in Glam Master, you always look so pretty.
I tried Clinique when you first talked about it but the color wasn’t light enough to match me so now that you told me they have new shades I will go try it again :) thank you!
Clinique has the worst shade options for cooler skin tones and they have a pretty large range. I tried this foundation and it’s pretty cakey, makes sense because it has the coverage of a concealer. But to each their own. 
I find this method not very efficient, time consuming if you’re blending properly, and pricey because you’re having to purchase several foundation colors.🤷🏼‍♀️
that is an absurd amount of foundation
With the “right” fillers, lighting, filter on your camera YOU TOO can look just like this illusion!!
I tried the clinique foundation and absolutely hated it on my skin! It looked no where near flawless as it looks on you :( makeup forever ultra hd foundation sticks are my fav to contour)
This is the only foundation that covers my melasma! I LOVE this foundation!!! Loved this and I'm going to try it!!
Love the video! xxx
Omg I love you!! The intro was fantastic!!!
Can you do makeup on mature or/and olive skin so I can do makeup on my mum?
Hello beautiful!! Love u much 😍😍😍I love glammasters!!
God girl I've been following you since 2009 ! Love ur videos!
I love learning things from Kandee 💜 also you should do the eye makeup look hugs
All the shampoos you did for Xmas 2017 u need to have year round...im so sad,they smelled the BEST!!!
Kandee I first learned this technique from you 5 years ago. I love it and use it often 💜
I’ve been watching your videos for so long I love you so much💖💖💖
You are the most beautiful person (inside and out)! Thank you for always being so inspiring, uplifting, and positive! You were the first youtuber I ever watched, and I always come back to rewatch videos to cheer me up! <3
I came here From FBE and thought that your really pretty ❤️




Edit: I thought you had 3,000 so I subscribed.. then I rechecked it lol ❤️💕
It's always great to see you Kandee! I've been following you for years girl!!
4 MILLION HERE WE COME!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I really like clinique but they don't have my color in that foundation. The undertones are too weird in the darker shades lol.
Holy catfish batman
The difference in the way your skin looks is amazing.
I love wearing this for special occasions:) What do you recommend someone pushing 40, and for a daily foundation? I worry about lines getting accented with heavy foundation:)
Thank you for working so hard on editing this video Kandee! I love youuu 😘😘
Can you do a video on how to keep makeup clean when you are a makeup artist
Are you kidding, you're the main reason I watch that show...love it...you are just the most beautiful, humble soul , much luv, and respect girl xx
1. Please upload more often! 
2. Love you !
3. I do love that foundation. I agree it lasts all day. I’m in shock but it does. 
4. You always have amazing tips and tricks. Any tips for summertime glow for dry skin?

I do this with this foundation too!!!! It's so buttery and smooth. I have 2 shades and may try your trick with the 3rd. Love the video!!! Yay Clinique!!
Love the coverage of the foundation!!
I love you so much Kandee. I'm screaming 💃👯💃👯
So far that's my holygrail foundation 😎
I get so excited to see a notification with your name on it lol. 💜💜💜💜 you!!!!
I love this foundation and I tired it because of YOU!
29 dollars is cheap for drug store foundation?!? Our drug store foundation usually runs around $15.  Like physicians formula, Revlon, maybelline and more.
I love, love, love, Clinique Beyond Perfecting, thanks to this you and this video!! Now I need to get some of the darker ones so I can try out this contour look. 💖
Eye shadow for dummies
That Mona lisa intro tho😂😂😂💕
This was too cute! Love & Light from another Kandee;)
You think $29 is super cheap for a bottle of drug store foundation?! 
 Damn I wish I had your life💸💰
Looks really good tho💁🏼💋
yeah. this Looks so crazy while you're still working on it. lol
I tried the foundation. Three issues: (a) it oxidized, (b) really accentuated texture and (c) despite being NC20, I could not find my colour, as the shades are quite warm.
This was hilarious lol.😂 I enjoy your videos.  ♡
I absolutely love these contouring tricks! please do more. Eyeshadow with color for mature skin. I am not ready to give up color for matte neutrals 💖💖💖
Wow! You're really good! Love this! Thanks for sharing! I need to try this! 😍❤️
L💖VE your accents. I especially do them also when doing my makeup!! Missed you on here!! OG Fave for ever!! xoxo
I love and respect you so much kandee!!! It’s so awesome seeing you on glam masters!!! You and Mario are so sweet and genuine!!!
Love and support💕🌹💕🌹

Is it suitable for daily use?
Will you plz do the look you're wearing now...I love the eyes

--- So, so pretty & I love her hair. :)
HOLY SNAP, KANDEE! I tried this the day after I watched it and my makeup literally never looked better! My skin looked flawless and perfectly contoured. I'm still dumbfounded at how easy and simple it was! Thank you for sharing this. You have made my beauty routine that much more easy and amazing. I LOVE YOU!!
I'm obsessed with glam masters it's so good. I can't wait to see what you do next your amazing
which moisturizer do you use before foundation?
Yay! Its Kandee ❤❤ I am enjoying Glam Master soooo much 😍 so many talented makeup artist. Xoxo
OMG! THIS IS OG!!!!! Love you Kandee!
Oh my goodness! I’m excited for another Kandee video!! Love you so much!!🍭
I love love you!! You taught me to contour and I even went out and bought the RCMA palette even tho I had never even heard of it never knew about it nothing. You're such s positive and amazing and absolutely gorgeous!! Thank you for just being you bc you're one very special human being🦋🦄
Also,Milani it's a makeup line at the drugstore and they have the best hands down concealer and foundation 2in 1 and it's not something I'd ever try but I used Clinique years ago,I'm sure it's changed,but it didn't work for me but u loved it so much I tried the Milani one and u have to try it it's amazing their whole brand is. You should do a review on that and the prep/glow/set pressed powder it's my holy grail too!! Adore you so much❤️❤️
You are the most gorgeous woman .. outside and inside 
Keep it up girl .. killing it 🙌🔥💛
2:35 So get a shade that's a bit darker bc it while oxidize lighter?
I've been using this foundation every since you introduced it & I agree 100%, it is awesome! Covers so amazingly & blends so beautifully! Thanks for the recommendation! Love you videos!
Yass !! So happy to see your face! Loving the intro! 😂😂😂
Love short cuts! Awesome tip pretty girl! Congrats on all your success....miss your videos- Love You! 😘💖
LOVEd THE INTRO🖤🖤🖤

I have watched your channel for years. You have truly helped me in more ways than you know. Love how you make this look so effortless. 💕👌🏼
I love clinique products but never used foundation till I got older so thank you I will now try it! 😘🤗
Its ALLL I DO lol because as you get older each layer can add YEARS so I only do one layer and it includes highlight bronzer blush and contour!!!😘❤💜
Love your channel and I'm SOOO glad you're doing this because people have gotten CrAzY with the products and are beyond"cake face"and more like"concrete sidewalk face"😲
You are amazing Kandee, I love your energy and you are so so beautiful. Makes me smile. Hugs and Love to you <3
Stunning. You are gorgeous. Thank you for sharing. 💗
You are stunning!  Thank you for sharing this!!  Much 💕
Hi Kandee! I love you and your videos!

Kandee, I'm using" it" foundation and unicorn tears by Too Faced for contouring.
Clinique has some of the best products though. I agree!

I like Beyond Perfecting! 💛
I love watching Glam Masters I DVR at so I can make sure I don't miss it.. it's so funny you're doing this tutorial because sometimes I buy the wrong color of foundation and if I don't return it it's sitting there so I've been using it for contouring
I love that foundation too but i just wish it came with a pump 😑
Please please do a life update! Love you 😘
I love this foundation too! I've been using it since you brought it up the first time!! Love you. Ps I binge watched Glam Masters this afternoon btw. Keep shining your light!
So glad I don't have to paint my face
Is the beyond perfecting good for acne scars/hyper pigmentation? Like FULL coverage?
I want a tutorial of your makeup look in the thumbnail!

Yaass girl! I live for your instruction video! I have learned everything from you!

I love and miss your videos ❤️❤️❤️
Love the beyond perfecting foundation. It's the only foundation I use now.
Yay! It feels like it's been forever since I've seen a Kandee video!!! GlamMasters is great but needs more Kandee and Laverne screen time! 

Please show us more looks using the I Want Kandee palette!!!
Love the plumped lips! Not overdone just perfect
I love love ur videos but it feels so rushed and not in depth especially with these type of videos ...please try a more detailed tutorial...
💡idea! Do a review of the Real Techniques Bold metals miracle diamond sponge!! Please!
I absolutely LOVE Beyond Perfecting Foundation! Changed my makeup game immensely. ❌⭕️❌⭕️
I loved watching Glam Masters. Learned so much from the show and loved seeing everyone’s creative ideas. ❤️💕🌈
Kandee!! You are literally the sweetest person! Beautiful inside and out!! I love your videos because you are so uplifting and just brighten my day!!! Thank you for being you!!!

I got this makeup because of how much you rave about it. I do love it. It’s amazing. I haven’t used a darker color for contouring though. I may have to try that. 
Love alllllll your videos.
Loved this video. Stupid Question: how do you pick the perfect shade of eyebrow pencil? Yours looks so perfect and natural.
What lip products are you using?
You are too dang cute 💗💗

I love Clinique Beyond Perfecting Foundation and get compliments that my skin looks smooth, even with acne scars. It just can look heavy on skin with texture if not blended well between "coats" lol. Like paintin a house!
LOVE YOU KANDEE!!! Ive missed your videos sooooo much! You are such an inspiration. You have taught me alot and got me back into trying new things with makeup! Keep rockin girl! Xoxo
Love it! Does the multiple layers make it thick and cakey though?
Yass!! I love this foundation! I'm actually out at the moment, hey Clinique I wouldn't be mad if you sent me some too! 😂😂 Kandee, did you know Clinique uses your video in their makeup classes?
Had to pause it- you killed me with the contured Mona Lisa!!!😂😂😂😂
Right...off to watching the rest! And of course I pressed "like" before even pressing "start"...
I'm trying to count how many years I've been subscribed to your channel and religiously watching your videos...and I'm realising- I'M OLD!!!!! That's how long...😁😘
Always love your videos! I would love to see you do a tutorial for the “Glass Skin” trend that is going around!!!!

I really want to try that foundation since you talk about it all the time!! 😂💕 I just don't know if it would work with my oily skin though :// I love you so much!! 💓💓💓💓
This is a brilliant video, love!
Thank you so much for this information. I have different foundations different brands. Will that effect the affect? Thank you again. ♡♡♡
Nice to see you Kandee, it's been a while ❤️❤️❤️
Need to try this! I can't believe I've only found your channel today because jeffreestar mentioned you in his new video 😂

Thank you!  Although I do no like that brand, I did try this technique with another brand.  Wow!  Great tip.  I didn't put as much on...but that was an awesome trick.
You're so beautiful and inspirational 🙌😇💞💞💞 sending you huge hugs XOXO!
Absolutely love your videos! You are a joy to watch...we love you too! Muah!!!!
Love how you show us how to fix a mess up... 💕💕💕 Is normal people tend to do that lol! Thx for this. Surely looks scary at first but WOW did it turn out beautifully 😍😍😍 thx so much for this. Hopefully one day my husband will let me try this foundation 😂😂 he REFUSES to buy makeup lol FML
I miss your makeup videos!!! Love watching you put makeup on...please do more! 😁
KANDEE PLEASE HELP!!! Is there ANY way that I can show you all my make-up and tell me WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!?! I seriously need help, I always end up creasing, blotching, and my face is literally a mess after an hour. Please, I trust in you, save me! My tweeter is meow_rchl SOS!!!!!!
Gosh you are so beautiful!!!!!  Thank you for showing us this trick!!  It looks pretty easy!
OMG! I HAVE BEEN CONTOURING AND HIGHLIGHTING FOREVER WITH JUST MY FOUNDATION! THANK YOU FOR LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS TAKE ALLLLLLL THE PRODUCTS AT ONCE TO CREATE A LOOK LOL
This tutorial really brought me back! 💜💜💜
Oh how I've missed you, love you!❤
I love you girl! Thank you for your sweet spirit!
Yes, the Beyond Perfecting Foundation is THE BEST. I even have an airbrush, and I prefer Clinique!
Love this idea! I have this foundation... I went to a Clinique class in January and was SO excited that it was the foundation that we used. I’ve been wanting to try it but never got around to purchasing it. After the class I bought it immediately! What a great idea to purchase it a few colors lighter and darker to do contouring with. Thanks for another great vid... hard to believe I’ve been watching you for 8 years! 🍡🍬🍭
That was so freaky, I hit the subscribe button at the end of the video and your phone dinged! Crazy coincidence.
I literally have been watching you since you made vids back in 2009 and you haven’t changed at all. You’re still so bubbly, so fun, so happy and so humble. You have and have always had an amazing talent but what REALLY sold me was your beautiful soul. Thank you Kandy! I love you! 💖💖💖
I love ❤️ the beyond perfecting and u are having deja vu because u DEFINITELY went over this several times in your older tutorials 😂🤣🤣❤️🍭🍬🍫❤️ and I use it the same way I'm pastry white so my highlight is the lightest shade alabaster I think 💭 and linen is my faux contour even if I'm using another foundation I still cocktail 🍹 this one in to do that effect and then use powder products to highlight more or chisel more love ❤️ you
Do you have a cruelty-free foundation recommendation?  Love your vids!
💖💖💖💖
💕how is this product for creasing? Under eye...?
I use lighter and darker foundations to shade and highlight too.. but I use wayy less product. I want to try this clinique beyond perfecting foundation. Thanks for recommending it!
This is why i have trust issues!
You’re such a doll! I love you! That makeup does sound perfect. And it looks great on you! 🦋⭐️
I'm new to watching you but I absolutely adore you. Great minds think alike. I've been using the same foundation and technique for many years. To see you do the same thing that I do makes me feel so much better. I thought I was the only one that used foundations for my contouring. However I started using tart product for my highlighter. Love love love your video. Don't stop being you. You have so much charisma it makes for a great video. Your absolutely adorable doll. Thanks for this video.
Your hair 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
How did u do this natural mini Smokey eye on this video? I LOVE IT!!!
i have that clinque foundation and i hate it so much!!!! its horrible for dry skin
Thank you so much for this video😊
when you say you ''partnered with Clinique'' - aren't you supposed to put 'AD' or 'SPON' in the title or video????????
I love that foundation too it's amazing!!
Your videos are the best! Can watch you all day, every day!! & You are gorgeous with & without makeup!
Kandee I love you! Do you have any suggestions of foundation for dry skin!? Everything I use settles into my dry patches and looks bad!    💞
😍😍😍😍 i just adore you Kandee! Where is your shirt/sweater from ?
I love you too! Missing your videos 😟
If only Clinique was cruelty free :-/
I do love when you morph into the English accent even though no-one really sounds like that in England lol x
You did a good job looking like a dummy.  Grats!
aka how to look fake and unattractive
I LOVE the Clinique Beyond Perfecting!  It's the perfect full coverage but I do have a problem with it transferring into clothes etc.  Still my all time favorite and I use it daily!
snapchat fam! 💕
Details on your nails from the KKW collab.  PLEASE!!!!!!!-
Kandee thank you so much for all your helpful tutorials, you are beautiful inside and out! 😘
This was my first Kandee experience!! I loved it! I love you too! You're my fave on Snapchat!! You inspire me and encourage me on my worst days. ❤❤❤
You are stunning! I can see why your a makeup artist.. your tricks are great and flawless and you look amazing. Just subbed and think a lot of the beauty community could learn a little something something from you girl! Again your flawless.. thanks for sharing this and I def have been looking for a full, I mean full coverage foundation and will be trying this one and see if it's all the rage. 😚😁 Again really enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing 😚
I’ve tried it and looks to Cakey on my skin but great idea I’ll try my other foundations that way. 👍
I was obsessed with this foundation for the longest time!!! But...the shade range..I'm very fair. And i used 0.5 breeze and still needed a foundation mixer. So I'm hoping they come out with a better range. Love you kandee!!!! You are the best xoxoxox
I love the Beyond Perfecting but always find it separating on my skin at the end of the day. Can you help with this?
Beautiful !! Love the hair !! I haven’t found a shade that matches my undertone/skin tone , hopefully Clinique brings more shades soon !
Love it... I actually do the same thing with golden, amber and clove
0:26 Cute face.  😍  Want 2 go 2 the Lemon Festival in Downtown Upland on April 28?
I loved the intro
I miss your videos. 😳
I'm going to go try this clinique!
I use this foundation in golden neutral and I love it
lol the intro is so funny!
I LOVE this technique in your video and am definately going to give it a try 😍😍 If you had to choose a full coverage foundation thats cruelty-free, what would you choose?
I love that I know that this isn't the first time you've used the word "chingaly" to describe your jewelry lol. ILY
LOOOOOOOOVEEEE THIS LITTLE INTRO! Super cute Kandee! I've never used two foundations to contour and highlight! Definitely going to try this soon!
I also love your British accent.... I'm a Brit 🙌
Yaaay! Much love my Kandee Beauty ♡♡♡ HUGE HUGE HUGS ♡♡♡
I love the intro! Thank you for the great tips Kandee. I've been wanting to try this foundation for a long time. I will definitely get the 10 day trial. I love you so so much 💕💕💕💓💓💓💕💕💕
I'm obsessed with Glam Master. I'm sad that it's almost over. I hope you have season 2, 3,4,5,.......you get it. I need you to be apart of it forever, or as long as you want to be apart of the show.
Omg, I use the same foundation
BUT, what lippie are you wearing though?
Umm your voice.... I think I just feel in love 💕 you are an angel
This is more work than just putting on foundation and the doing a powder contour lol
Could you do a tutorial on how to make baby fine/thin hair look fuller, esp. around the hairline and part-line?
I love this video, it should be a series! I would love a easy smoky eye for dummies next. That would be so helpful
thats amazing !! with only foundation! im doing my own makeup for my wedding, using beneift foundation would you put primer on first? x
Love your videos but I wouldn't be able afford all three of them at once but I would deffenitally try this just for foundation.
I was so excited to see you on Glam Masters! yay!
Lander okay....I just saw your KKW tutorial...it was beautiful...
How do you know when to use a damp sponge vs dry?
I just binged watched glam master and I’m so excited for the finale!!
OOOH LA-LA (is French)
woohoo, I love me some good makeup witchcraft!
Ok if even YOU struggle with how you just contoured then we can't do it either
I want to try beyond perfection, but it's too dark and orange on me
You just used more foundation in one face of makeup than I use in like 10 LOL
Loved this! 💚
You are entering! Love watching your videos.
youre so animated - I love it!
Holy shit..  from Zombie to  Clown Amazin....... keep blending..
You are perfection
Who u callin’ a dummy? 😆
Videos with your grandma would be great. Love you Kandee😊
Love you kandee!❤️❤️
That's one of my favorite foundations too!!!
Lol that intro!
You are so pretty Kandee 💕
Love love love the extra time you put into the intro :-) so cute.
FYI, definitely most beautiful without the makeup!!! But whatever floats your boat ;)
Wow that was actually super helpful! Totally going to try this.
"is contouring just confusing"?😂
I am not feeling motivated today and your video notification pop and I already feel better... love you to the moon and beyond
i love the opening!!
Hey sweetie, what foundation do you recommend for full coverage  foundation drugstore?
I've been doing this for years. Its a great tip!
Should you put eye shadow on before or after foundation?
I thought the contouring with foundation was a perfect title! But it makes sense😂😘
Girl you are the bomb!
Thank you for always making it so simple and easy to understand!
You're the only reason I will turn on lifetime... so happy to see a new video!
Love me a chatty Kandee! Nice intro :)
I have not got a chance to watch it yet, just wanted to let you know that I DID get a notification!😊 Weird how YouTube picks and chooses 🤔
Contouring has never looked easier!
This is amazing 😍
I lowkey almost didn’t watch this because of the title but I’ve been following you for a while so I gave it a chance.
Thank you 💕💙
She is good...so much more info vs other ppl
Clinique was the very first brand of foundation that I ever used! You are so beautiful! Can you come do my makeup for me? :) <3
brilliant film 🤔
You should try doing a reverse contour, IDK what that would look like
Kandee, I've been watching you since the very beginning of your YouTube career and can draw inspiration from ANY of your videos because you're so positive and uplifting! I love seeing all the progress you've made, truly an inspiration ❤ You're a rare type of person in this community so never stop doing what you do!
This seems so simple and looks so natural, might snatch this for my larp / cosplay / fancy makeup days 😍
Just saw you on TMZ talking about wanting to be a Boy Scout but wanting to sell cookies too! ❤️❤️❤️ loveeeeee you girl! You looked amazing!
You are absolutely wonderful! I adore you so much and I am totally running out this week to grab that foundation.
Totally going to go get color matched for that foundation! Love clinique products.
Love your hair color! And always love seeing your make up tips! TFS
It was so hard for me to match this foundation! But it is amazing ❤️😭
Damn, Kandee - This was genius my friend!  You have sold me on the Clinique Beyond Perfecting foundation!!  Think I'm gonna head over to Sephora this afternoon to pick up a few bottles, it looks SO gorgeous on you and now I can't wait to try it myself!  I can't believe I never knew about your new show, GlamMasters!  I will definitely be checking that out ASAP!!!  So much love and respect from me to YOU!
Haven’t been here in years. I’m amazed at how good you still look. What kind of witchcraft ???
This foundation is really heavy and thick....I can't imagine what you look like in real life with ALL of that on. Yikes!
💜💜💜 You made that so easy-peasy!!!  I may actually attempt it!!!  😬!!!  I know everyone is different, but is there an estimate of how many shades darker the contour color should be from the highlight color?  Jacque 💜💜💜
Love you Kandee! You’re so beautiful❤️
you make me wanna dye my hair pink again! .... and I've been so good! (my colorist has forbidden me from coloring my hair anymore 😢)
Ooooooomg I love this @kandeejohnson !!!! I'm terrible at this kind of thing lol... But I'm definitely gonna try this, looks pretty easy... I hope😁😁😁😁💝💝💝💝💝 thanks pumpkin.  💖💖💖
I bought irascible anathema for dummies, which taught my coterie and I how to behave TERRIBLY in any situation, making everyone feel AWFUL, humiliated, and trolled. 

Oh wait, no, that is just the Twitter environment. My bad.
Kandee, I remember when you would so this same technique with   Loreal True Match!
I love you and your British accent sucks but that’s funny keep it up!<3
My dad has guitar for dummies book 🎸
OMG THIS IS FABULOUS!
I think you were prettier before all the make up.
The intro was so cool!!!!
MGTOW...NOW.
Yeah I love you so much your soul is great
1FIRS TIME I SEE YOU .. AND YOU IMPRESS ME..I LOVE YOU 🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
I wanted to wear this clinique but it was way too orange for me. So sad because I need this kind of coverage.
Oh Kandee, you’re so adorable! Love this video!
I clicked on your video cause your so sexy!
that contour is POPPIN!
I will be trying this out for sure.
Hilarious the Mona Lisa as Kim K- I had no idea
That foundation didn't sit well on my dry skin
I usually love your videos but I have a feeling you just messed up and uploaded it anyway.. :/
Never forget you are loved too! 💋💖💖💖
kendy , you are soo right that foundation one, is a very smart tool,,,to save time,,,,!!!!thank you for shareing
“Oxidizing lighter” ?? “You can darken your neck”  omfg I feel so uncomfortable right now.

Anyone who hates on your british accent can leave right now. You’re not part of the fam, bye. P.S. Missed you as well, not just the accent. Xxx (cause thatks how the British end their notes)
my sweet hart ❤️❤️❤️ love you so much 😘😘😘🎉💋
Gorgeous! I will pick up some #Clinique foudation and try this look as soon as I’m out of the hospital. I’ve been on a foundation kick lately, trying to find that perfect every day look.
LMAO@mona Lisa side by side

When u came to San Francisco I was obsessed with this foundation when they put it on and I still use it I love it just as much today as I did then lots of love❤️❤️❤️
YOU are too adorbs, can I keep you in my pocket?!
I do this too! Sephora only had dark shades left in their sample bottles, i thought it might make a good contour 🤓 i bought this foundation because you first mentioned it
I love clinique foundation too its the only one that really covers my imperfections
Easy beautiful cover girl
Pleaseeeeee do Gwen Stefani’s look from Jimmy Kimmel the other night - that glittery nude look it was amazing and you would do it perfect!
I work as a Clinique consultant and this is my FAVORITE foundation for my dry combo skin! Love it, I need to get a darker shade! Never tried this contouring method. You are beautiful, You are so close to 4 Mil!
Hello! Love this! What colours are the Clinique foundations?
Got the clinique beyond perfecting foundation and I've dry skin and roseacea it did not work for me, and I found it really drying and that it actually deepened in colour. Desperately seeking a hydrating primer so I can give it another try.
BIG SHOT OUT TO GLAM MASTERS I LOVE THAT SHOW!! BIG HUGS KANDEE. ALWAYS LET YOUR SOUL SHINE ✌️ TY FROM OHIO
Remember when you would say, big hugs from my house to yours?  (something like that)  I miss that.

So your kind words felt very personally directed at me when I needed it most . Thank you , you’re so beautiful and talented💜
What lipstick do u use . I really love that color
Loved the infomercial part! Haha your so Kute Kandee!!
Plus l just bought this foundation and waiting for it in the mail lol
Kandee- i tried the foundation and it looked so cakey on my skin. Any advise? Lysm
i switched from too faced born this way to this clinique foundation and i love it so much! i am the lightest shade!
Ok that’s it.  I’m convinced and I must try Clinique foundation.  Thanks, doll!!!!
What is your lipstick you’re wearing? 

Someone tell me
Micheal Jackson.
What a great idea!   ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
,
Your contouring viseo from a few years ago is what originally taught me how to contour my face! Been looking 10lbs lighter ever since!! Thank you Kandee!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌 btw, you are absolutely gorgeous!! 💖💖
I’m English and I love your English accent ❤️❤️
Love the full coverage of that foundation! I’m so impressed how flawless it makes your skin look! I’ve never contoured before but I’m going to try this & hope it works for me! 🤞🏼
P. S. I follow you and am dying to see your 23 & me video! When are you going to post it?? I’m dying over here! Much love! Xoxo 💋
I remember the first video you did with this foundation! I went and bought it...still love it today!! It really is awesome! Love you kandee!
💜💜💜 amazing every time!!!!
why don't you wet the sponge? Just curious =)
@kandeeJohnson  if your talking about freckles or pigmentation have you thought about an IPL treatment ? Just wondering not saying you have to or need it. Just something if you didn’t like those areas.
I love watching your tutorials!
This is my favorite foundation ever since you shared it! What are your favorite skin care products this month?!?
Love you toooo Kandeee ❤️I watch u since I was little the first video was pin up looks make up 😍🤩you taught me everything , I thank u for that I love u wish u all te happiness in ur life u deserve it 💋🙌😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kandee- You are fabulous, and I love you soooo much  😘 Hope you're having a great day!
soooooo quick question- I should buy two foundations one a little bit lighter than my actual complexion and one a couple Shades Darker than my actual complexion
HAVE U EVER TRIED THE MARC JACOBS  FOUNDATION?? ITS FULL COVERAGE......OR TRIED ANY CHANEL  FOUNDATIONS??
A KKW X MARIO palette tutorial/ different looks using the palette. Or maybe an arabic inspired makeup look. OR BOTH!
Is that foundation  is SPF free? Does it give you a flash back during the photo sessions?
Omg haven’t seen your videos in awhile! Love you girl
I really love this and I have been really wanting to try this foundation!°
Love me some cream contour...can’t wait to try out this technique!! Ty suga bug 🍭
You are more beautiful than you , more talented than you think and you are loved by so many . Thank you Kandee for taking the time out of your busy life,work and sharing this with us ... God bless you and your family.
Your top 😍where is it from? Your lashes and the whole look 😍👌🏻Kandee i’ve been watching your videos since i had my first son in 2009 ❤️❤️❤️
"I''m not trying to look like a caveman " 🤣👌 hehehe this is why I watch your videos no matter what the content.   Quirky, cool and fun Kandee!   Love ya! 💗
I can do that. Need more foundation. Will try the foundation you use. I already use the skincare so. 😘💋💕
Aaaaaachhhh love it , love YOU,  just recently started following YOU after watching Glam Masters and I felt in love from the very first time I saw YOU,  KANDEE you are beautifully wonderful 😍😍😍😍😎😎😙
Omg this helped me a lot, thank you. I'll check it out but is the Clinque foundation perfect for oily skin too??
I love that foundation too!!!! I need to see if they have a better shade for me though, because I hesitate using it only because its too dark on me even as a light shade. Thanks for such a fun and interesting video, it'd be fun to try this! I always have contoured like a pro with powders.
Hi, Humans. The surface of the sun unites us all. We leave the planet to join the sun. The moon will share it's light with us. However, it's up to us to share the light with the sun. The light is bright from the sun. When we leave the sun behind, the light grows dark. It shares a sadness throughout the universe, as we hold darkness in our hands. The sands of time leave us alone. The sun and moon bring us home.

TERRANCE OUT
I tried the beyond perfecting and hated it :(  the formula was just not right for my skin. I used the smallest amount on my beauty blender and it would become so cakey and shiney and just overall nasty on my face during the day, couldn't wait to take it off after a couple of hours (and yes I used primer and setting powder and spray ;) ). I actually ended up throwing it out after many tries with different primers and applicators. Can't fathom how much Kandee uses on her face 😲
I've been doing this technique for a long time, but I use waaayy less product. The cool thing is you can make it look very natural or very glam depending on how much you layer and what you use to blend it out.
Yay Kandee! Bern waiting for this! 💖💖💖
I have this foundation and I absolutely love it.  granted, it's very matte and I have dry skin, but I bought some facial oil from amazon and I place 2 drops and it works beautifully. Doesn't take away from the formula and it blends into the skin better and doesn't dry out my skin. I got this tip from Wayne Goss's video.
You should try sentence Foundation have amazing variety of shades and it adjust to your skin they adjust three shade up and down with just each one and only use a little to cover it all plus has seneplex which is unique to only sensegence to help your skin bring new cells come to surface faster and and reduces aging amazing.
What color and brand lip product 
do you have on your lips? Its so pretty! Is it one of the new Clinique Pop Splash lippies?
Love this trick! Gotta try this miracle foundation!!! :D And I love your British accent Kandee!! I like speaking like a Brit too ☺️
Wow...she's much prettier without makeup...!!!
I first saw and heard of you on "Good Mythical Morning", I watch that show with my step son and I was introduced to the beautiful world of Kandee Johnson and your mad makeup skills and how nice, down to earth and FUNNY you seem xoxo
You're a gem :)
Your voice sounds  just like Gwen Stefani lol
So pretty in the before!
Why won’t it let me click the bell for some people?! WTF you, Tati, JKissa and more I can’t click the bell. I don’t get it. Anyone else with this issue for certain people??
She is absolutely gorgeous only came across her today, I'm sooooo crushing on her right now
Three free payments... I like that. You have a real winning personality. Thank you for making this.
Your video is great think you are awesome the only foundation I use is pretty much just Clinique
Yay Clinique! Make some lighter shades in that foundation please. No shades light enough.
Why hide behind a bunch of makeup,
It's kind of like having a $500 car with $30,000 with Auto Body on it.
Just be yourself and be proud of it
Thank u Kandee, always so lovely 💕
I been trying to get. I am dealing with deep pours coming through my foundation without it looking cakey. Help!!!
My skins the same way I thank you for all your tips ...very very pretty ❤️
I've been using Cliniques Beyond Perfecting ever since the first time you made a video about it!  I also have not found any other foundation with the beautiful full coverage this gives, the only down side for me is that it transfers easily even when I set it.  If you have any tips for preventing that I'd appreciate it so much!  I currently set with Air Spun setting powder in translucent.  😊
Where can I buy a beauty blender?
So glad  I found your channel !
so much products on one face..ew
I just tried this combo, worked like a charm! Thanks Kandee! 🦄
Runs to nearest Clinique counter
Great video 👍❤❤ I've used that foundation I love it!!!
Love this...check out www.myabsolutebeauty.com for lash lift supplies!

Love you Kandee!!! And this is a great tip! I definitely need to try this out to perfect my contouring!!!
Love youuuu ❤️❤️❤️
I've been looking for a foundation, I'm going to take your advice and go get a sample to try it out. I had gotten a sample of the Nars every day and long wear. I did like those but I have been wanting something like you said super full coverage to give me skin like a doll! Thanks for the video loved it!
I would love to know how keep top lid neutral n put Pop of color on bottom lash line
$free.99! HAH!!! good one.
You are just so precious!! I love your heart!! Style is way awesome too!! And girl your pink hair!! I love it when my hair is PINK!!!!!!
That’s AMAZING!!! Thanks so much!!
This was a mess ...it looks so muddy !
I bought this foundation based on your recommendation and I really love it. I do the come out with more shades.
You've made this video in another format I'd like to see some different content
Love your top!  🖤. Where can I get one?
That intro 😍😍😍
As always love your videos! I’ll try this foundation out.
I love it too!!! I got it because you talk about it. And its my go to now. Its weird how it doesnt feel heavy on the skin like other full coverage foundations. Thank u for the video, going to get a darker shade to contour!!!
You are such a doll I get a big kick out of watching you videos.
that shade range is awful. alabaster shouldn't be orange :p i'll skip this one ^^
I used that foundation, but it slippy slide on my face... 😣 what did I do wrong? 🤔
Bring a smile to my face EVERY TIME I watch your videos!❤️ ... any tips on how to work with a the RCMA VK foundation palettes?! Have them in my kit and am lost!😬
You’re always so pretty, with or without makeup! Never get plastic surgery! You’re sooooo pretty. Also your soul is beyond gorgeous. ❤️❤️❤️
Love this technique. I've always wonder why no one ever contour like this.
My daughter works the Clinique counter in a local department store. I absolutely love this foundation!!!!
Bought beyond perfecting a while ago in literally the lightest shade they have (for my super pale face) and it was way too dark and orange. I would love to try it and love it but it was way too dark for me. Disappointing.
If I could have you do my makeup so I could actually find a foundation that matches me and doesn’t make me orange that would be AMAZING!
Upvote if you love $FREE.99 as well.
So many ppl sleep on Clinique ... they’re hardly ever in a guru’s channel .. I’ve been using them for a few years and love their foundation !
Half way through video, kandee your amazing!
I loved this video. I wonder if you could do a video on the makeup your wearing. It’s so beautifully done. Love your videos.
29 bucks is super cheap??
I love that foundation but they need some lighter shades!!
I love you Candy sooooo much I look up to you girl
Brilliant but that looks like so much foundation.
Wow!!... and here we are all dummies watching!  Lol.😁
YouTube thinks I'm a "dummy" this came up in my recommendations
love the video 💖
wish this product was cruelty free so i could try it!!!
Just one shade lighter and one shade darker than your regular foundation?
Love U girlie xoxo
i love this!
Love it Kandee! So nice to have a new video from you!!! I want to try this foundation! I still need help with the cat eye😩❤️ you!
Thirty dollars for foundation...!?!!? I'm fighting with my wallet to spend 8 dollars on my fit me foundation! Not every one is a famous rich person like you!! Still love you though
I love you Kandeee!! <3 <3
1. Loved you on Glam Masters. 2. This is the first youtube video of yours I watched. Loved that you were real and made mistakes! shows that even the professionals have to play around with the makeup to make the look. I'm excited to watch more of your videos. Your personality is infectious!
I just love you so much and your such an inspirational person
As always u look beautiful. That foundation trick was great. But me I'm not good at putting on foundation. I tried but it doesn't look good at all. But I guess I have 2 find the right foundation. Thanks 4 the contouring trick. Cool.. Love u Kandee.
earlayyy!!!
I need help with my eyebrows!!!
Lol I do this cuz I can never find my shade lol
I love that you said to darken your neck, and that makeup has no rules —I have been saying this forever (and apparently so have you, only I just now saw it!) and it is nice to hear that I’m not just crazy! :-) Thank you so much for this video! You have soooo brightened my day.
Kandee, this is awesome 👏
The picture on the left on the thumbnail is definitely photoshopped there’s no way your skin can be that perfect from makeup and her eyebrows can be made to look that much higher with makeup
I'm addicted to your videos
Cool review😊. Could you suggest me a cruelty free dupe for thé foundation?😊 i only support cruelty free brands and adore the look😍
AAAA BRAVO PICAZO
i really need the dark hair back on you!!
Woahhh whats the Rush! This gave me anxiety
Kandee I'm a dummie :D
 Can you help with a video on how to countour different face shapes? And to 'hide' the horrible double chin :/
Kandee what eye cream are you using? The area around your eyes looks amazing!! 🙏
Your skin too!! An skincare tutorial would be great! ❤️❤️ Lots of love Kandee ❤️❤️
Love your videos Kandee!!! Huge fan!!! Please do a Meghan Markle 2018 makeup tutorial. Thank you!! XX
Love youuu
Excuse me, Miss. You are so pretty w/o all that paint on your face. Just saying...peace.
oh im def trying this ..not a make-up fan,rarely wear any... but ......gotta try it once
Hi kandie, do you have any tips for people with pitted and scarred skin? I can’t seem to find products that will look good on me and it’s really upsetting. I want to look good for my hubby. I have oily but dehydrated skin 😘xx
Such a good idea!!! I am on the hunt for new foundation and an easier way to contour I think you sold me
Holy crap!!! You look so totally different with makeup on.  Oh, the wonderful, beautiful power of makeup!!!
Thank you made this very easy and simple. I am new to contouring and needed a simple way.since I am not a makeup artist.i would have loved to see how you used the rest of your make up and what you used on your face for the final look. But again great video.
I haven't watched her in a while, boy has she changed. She talks so fast and seems so hyper. She's like a different person from her earlier videos. Sadly, like a hot mess.
I’ve been using that foundation for about a year now ❤️ I love it!! U were the first makeup artist I ever watched and u seemed to really like it so I decided to try it and I’m so thankful I did!
I need this foundation! Love you Kandee
Love this !! ❤️❤️
I love that foundation too I'm using it now. And l love you too Kandee.
You. Are. A. Makeup. Wizard.
Love 💕 t!   I’m gonna try that foundation ferrrrr sure!
I love that foundation
I would like to see this also tried with a Maybelline Dream satin liquid foundation or Fit me as they are both awesome foundations
Loved the video
Free.99.    Wow
Is this foundation ok for dry skin?
this whole foundation thing just looks so discusting.
“More beautiful then you’ll ever know” says the one who gets her face filled with Botox, juvederm and restylane 🙄
I love that foundation! Lately I’ve been mixing it with my Nars all day too:)
I have fallen for this foundation but I have only been using one color. How many shades lighter or darker should I get so that I can do more contouring?
I wish i could find my shade. Tried twice and they haven't been able to match me.
They test on animals girls it’s not worth it.
I wish she did her research before promoting companies no animal should suffer for makeup  products it’s not worth it.
I used that foundation on my skin for one year, it made my pores look so big and my mom keep telling me to take this mask off because it looked like I was wearing Halloween makeup it's so thick.  I used it cosmetics now and I love it :)
Been using this foundation for about 3 years.. Not a huge fan,  I think it looks cakey on me and breaks apart easily. Any tips? It's also reallllyyyy yellow toned ):
Can you do a video on how to contour for someone who already has a thin face? Like, I already look like the crypt keeper as it is... I don't wanna look thinner.
This is brilliant!!
I actually thought you looked like a Barbie doll on your thumbnail. So your foundation tip does make you look like you have doll skin. Lovely.
Contouring seriously, dude if you spend that much detailed time on yourself then ......smh😒
I BUSTED OUT LAUGHING at "is contouring just confusing??" Omg thank god I live alone
Yes I love it to!
Ok, that's fine and good. How did you land  that Kim K. W. And Madonna interview?
Gorgeous boo♡☆
Contouring is the 😈
don't talk too long.
29 is not cheap...
Kandee, you are incredibly not funny and try too hard, but your makeup skills are good.
I would love it too im sure but they dont make my shade in the correct undertone
That's a lot of foundation
That’s what u see after waking up the next morning!!!!!
I love youuu!!! 💗💗💗
You look better without makeup
Hey Kandee with that foundation my pores look big and a little bit cakie
Going to buy this foundation ASAP
I know you have been using this for years.  I remember your first video with this, I went and bought it and I wanted it so bad to work for me because it looked amazing on you but unfortunately it was not any good on my skin. It separated and sunk in every line I had... I was so jealous because it always looked amazing on you
I missed you Kandee!!! This is a perfect birthday gift!!! As good as Im getting with my make up i suck at contours
Hahahahahahaha ‘oooh my lip is so big it makes a shadow’
Hi my name is Mayra and I am a dummy when it comes to contouring lol
I really love your lip color!!! What are you wearing in this video? Thanks!!
Love this!!!
Okay so I match to my collar bone because my face is darker than everything is that wrong
"Makeup lies for the insecure and dishonest about their looks"
it's cool concept but I don't wanna spend 90$ on my base only
Wow bondo works wonders. Between makeup and alcohol I'm going to make a few mistakes
This is the best
Would love to see a lip contouring
I actually like this technique.  Ima gonna try.
i love you SO much kandee!!!!! 💖💖
You are so cute and smart!!!
I LIIIIIIIVE for these videos of yours
had to sub you are just too cute
I live your films😍😍😍
I don't buy anything from Clinique because they test on animals.
You are so freakin awesome
I love your pink hair.  😍💓💖  It's the Cream of your haircolours.
Awesome tips! Now I can not look like a crazy girl at my son’s wedding next week!💕💕
Sorry one more thing,  where'd you get that shirt, it's so cool!
looks great. if i only want to use 1 shade for foundation-should i use the in between shade or the lighter shade?
Omg the b4 & after wow!!
I struggle so bad to find my shade
I love you Kandee!!!! I used to love this foundation and everything Clinique I hate that they are not cruelty free ☹️
which shade better for covers ages spots on Hispanic skin
Great video, you are the only YouTube MUA that does not piss me off
I dont like it. Looks muddy. But im glad u found something ur loving so much.
I'm gonna get this foundation and try it
I wanted to love this foundation because of you but I tried it and tried it. It was horrible for me but you look so beautiful.
Its 52 usd in lithuania....
Omgggg you’re soo freakin cuuuuuuteee
Thank you!
Do u know the jordana 2 in 1 foundation and concealer?? Plz try it...!
You look old as hell without makeup
this gave me soo much anxiettyyyyyyy, guys do NOT DO YOUR FOUNDATION/ CONTOUR LIKE THIS EVER...............
I would love to see the whole process
Dear you are so beautiful!!!!
$29 for a foundation is ridiculous. That is not 'affordable' my foundation is $6 THATS affordable. Girl you are too rich lol.
I love you Kandee!!!!
I honestly break down crying in the ends of her videos.. whenever Kandee gives words of motivation it makes me so warm and happy and emotional because they aren't words anyone else ever tells me. I love you Kandee 😭❤
You don't need all of that make-up hun. Your a doll without it!
she's a crease cutter. she's was like "it's not my socket."
You look like that fish from finding memo
Hey beautiful! I’ve struggled with melisma after having my two gorgeous girls. How does the Clinique foundation compare to Estée Lauder maximum coverage face and body. That’s been my ride or die, but looking for something more “skin like”. Love you and all your inspirational messages! 😘
I love your British accent it makes me laugh, and you look amazing as usual. But it does look like that was a lot of product being applied, no? I just don't like to look cakey.
Kandee I needed this! Thank you sooooooo much
Ur beautiful without makeup
I used that foundation before and it looked okay for a couple minutes, but then I looked like an oily mess.  So I had to use powder over it. Needless to say I returned it and bought my urban decay.  😘
What is your zodiac sign?
Hi Kandee, I love you!!! 💗💗💗
Missed your tutorials!!!!
I love your hair!
Your a perfect specimen.
It’s a shame you support companies who test on animals and aren’t cruelty free :( I’d be finding another foundation personally
If i used a that id look like cake face! I have textured skin as im getting older & i use the face peel wipes  . ugh uh how does your skin look so smooth everywhere? I'm definitely gonna try this foundation! Do u get any thing done like ...botox , injections? Us little people need to know so we can realize, if that's why we can't achieve the same results! Not that everyone is going to get the same Regardless! Anyways thanks for this video! I've been watching you since 2009 🤗! U probably won't see this . Happy day to ya😇!
I love u so so much! I love watching all your videos, youve taught me so much about make up and especially contouring! I'd love for u to do my make up 1 time and teach me more! 😘😉😀👏🙌proud of you
So really it’s $29X3 😉
this is a new concept for me and I really like it!! However I think I would still use contouring powder because it's doesn't look dramatic enough for me.
AGAIN YOU'RE AMAZING!!! Congratulations Kandee on your show!!! I'm excited to watch it!! With Mario!!!! LOVE your simple makeup i would love to know the products it's so great for everyday and i find it so hard to find a GREAT everyday look like yours. Next up Kandee Johnson show!!!!! You are SO talented and SO pretty and GREAT kind personality!!!!
That foundation looks amazing but I refuse to use Clinique because they STILL test on animals even thought there’s literally no reason to...
You are so pretty!!! Inside and out :)
I USE THE SAME FOUNDATION AND ITS FANTASTIC. 

I have super acne prone skin (even cystic) that gets worse around times of stress and hormonal changes. 

This. Foundation. Covers. Everything. It’s so light I don’t even feel it. I put it beneath my eyes on my cheeks around discoloration and on my acne. It even covers fine lines on more mature skin or if you have forehead creases whatever it fills it. 

I will never change this foundation. You can’t convince me... but I am looking for a pigmented powder and liquid lipsticks so if any of you have recommendations- hit me with em.
Cool video just found your channel. Gonna try this foundation!! 💗
Wow beauty be thy sight
I don’t even fit the lightest shade o Clinique 😢
I really like that foundation too, I have bought 2 different foundations shades from them but tbh I dont think it does me justice the way it does you. I feel like the (semi) new Sephora stick works much better for my skin. But I def see why you like it so much.
Sleep with the one on the right and wake up to the one on the left. Makes you wanna go screaming into the night
I need to go get this nowwww and stop debating lol
I have oily skin and no matter how much I set it with powder I get super oily after wearing it a few hours.
I love you Kandee soooo much
dude u just painted ur face and u look like a totally different person
What are those lips doe? I want it!
I knew before this video even started that she was going to be using this foundation lol
That is my favorrrritttte foundation, since I’ve found it I have not gone back to anything else
Hey
Are you aging Kandee?! Your freckles are larger than before! What are you doing to your skin!!!
When I saw the title I was like yes
Thank God for makeup .. of course  you gotta be good if your that ugly
Love you Kandee!!
What lip color is this? 😍
Hi Kandee, lots of love going your way🤗🤗. Now I have a problem that I need help with, my skin is dry and although I put on a lot of moisturizer on my skin prior to foundation it still looks dry and my smile wrinkles really stand out. Do you have any tricks you can share with me please. Thank you so much
I'm not normally a full coverage gal but you made me really want to try this! We have similar skin and complexion so I'm crossing my fingers. Anyone know if they do the ten day trial at Macy's?
Still haven’t tried it but I willl
ohhh you're look in this video is awesome! Can you please do a tutorial of your eyes???
I cringe when she does a British accent 😝
i want to try it but i dont think they have my shade
I tried this foundation and i live in a humid area, so i dont know if thats whats affecting it or what but its the only foundation i have had this issue with, but its also they only foundation that is my color. What am i doin wrong?
you are so very nice makeup artist
Lashes?!!!! 😍
I’m curious how much darker (shade) you go on the contour with Clinique. I’m not great at choosing skin match, I always try to get a little advice. This doesn’t seem like a thing someone could assist with.
🙊🙉🙈
I love it when things are free.99
We missed you Kandee! I’m so grateful God gave us YOU!! Your such a blessing! 🙏💗♥️💕❤️
Beautiful!  What is the lip product!  I love it!
This foundation is a no go on combo skin. :(
I’ve got that foundation and 4 swipes cover your whole face, full coverage. God knows what it looks like in person with this amount on
Every time I put foundation on I feel like I smeared butter all over my face.  I do wash and put toner on and also moisturizer for oily skin.   Any suggestions?
CONTOURING FOR DUMMIES - who do you call dummy! We all come here to judge you and check whether you know what you're doing and the answer is - yes! You do! 😀
Shameless or not I'm glad u said something about Glam Masters cause I did not know! I gotta look up when it comes on in Tampa, FL!   This might not be your specific issue, but I'm an esthetician plus deal w/ it myself (thank u child of mine 4 all those pregnancy hormones!) & I'm guessing u ended up w/ Melasma after having your lil 1 huh? I too really like the Clinique beyond perfecting, i def have 2 set it, but it covers everything....i have dark spots in similar areas & some PIH & PIE from breakouts ( yes, those damn hormones again! Im 33 & went into skincare 2 deal w/ my issues & now I've just managed 2 make everyone around me look younger & cure their "issues" but not my stupid skin! Ugh! 😕
I use this foundation all the time, it's the only one I use. But I still have trouble covering blemishes. Can you do a video showing the extra effort you'd put in for covering a serious blemish? While still using this foundation?
1:51 Do U have freckles on your cheeks straddlin yer nose?  U should show 'em.  Barbie's BFF Midge has freckles.
I LOVE IT! For me it's soooo difficult to do contouring so I'm definitely going to try this :) i live in Finland so where can I get those foundations? Thanks, hugs and kisses <3
It is so confusing!!! Thank you!!!
I don't like this foundation on me at all.  I went back to Estee Lauder Doublewear.
I bought my first foundation since highschool. I wore nothing but powder for years and then I stopped wearing makeup from 40 to 50. I bought the It Illumination CC cream. I need that glow on my older aging skin. You look beautiful as always!
whats going on with your skin, brown dots
Love how you just Slap the Foundations on your Face, not beeing fancy at all and at the end you look wawoom! You always did it that Way. You are the same Kandee from years ago, so kind and loving ❤ Love from Germany
I have two foil samples and a deluxe doe foot sample of that foundation. But it’s kinda light. The foil I know one will be light it’s Ivory. I used to wear. Clinique foundation as a teen with acne problems. They had a foundation may still that was oil free and it was super watery. It would run out like water u had to be careful with it. But I think it looked Good. This was in the 80s so we focused on Blush A lot more back then. Lol  and Blue eye shadow was the first shadow was always ur first color to wear. Lol. I did get away from that and bought the quads from Maybelline and Covergirl. I’m Purples and pinks and tailed. Great times. Lol.
$Free.99! So cute
You are so goofy! I love it 😍
You used Linen, Nutty & Golden Neutral, what's the fourth shade you used? Do you think this is good for someone who's a NC15? Thanks.
I've done this trick for years. Looks so much better than powder contour.
This is awesome and so it’s easy !! Love this and I’m gonna try this !!
I have finally bought Clinique beyond perfecting after years of you saying how amazing it is so I treated myself for my birthday after a tough year and omg it is amazing! Don't even need concealer most of the time, doesn't dry and go all cake, just amazing!
Tried it. Love it.
Can you please do a Fall Winter Bronzer video?
Oh Darling Kandee. What has happened. I've watch this next to 7 Steps Flawless Face, Jan 2013, and my sweet your so different. Where did the effervescence and voie de vivre go? You end each vid with such a beautiful affirmation. Please turn that back around and let that soak into you. Love Joy Blackberry
Your very beautiful . Love your eyes
I love you Kandee but $29 is not a little over the cost of drugstore makeup 😏 that’s like 3 of my Milani Conceal and Perfect foundation. But hey if it’s that good it’s worth a try! 👍🏻😘
Kandee it would be awesome if you did a clothing haul or a diy on some of the clothes you alter!! I love your style so much!!❤️
gorgeous. I am getting married and would love to see a full coverage all day stay make up with a pink Smokey eye and light pink lip and any tips and trick to look photo perfect all day please. thanks your amazing xxx
I've owned this foundation before and it's quite full coverage. I feel like the amount Kandee used would make my face look super cakey!
Waiiit ...whaaaat is happening ?
<3
Does it not get cakey? I'm always afraid of doing more layers of foundation because of that
Greta tecnique😍
Kandee is the coolest and the best!
Love this video!
Free $0.99
Honestly the only beauty youtube channel that I watch and try looks from all the time! Kandee's my favourite.
How do you keep this foundation from transferring?!? I tried it and love the coverage but it moves and transfers so bad. If I barely touch my face it basically all comes off! :(
I love your lip color, Kandee...what is it?
I have mature skin and I mix this foundation in two shades mixed with wet n wild photofocus....
Is this foundation good for extremely dry/dehydrated/ mature??? I used to only wear Clinique foundation for over 20 years but it wasn't this one. But my skin changed after menopause and I can't wear the one I wore before. I haven't found another foundation that I love since I stopped using my Clinique. But if this will work with all my dryness then I'll probably go and try it out!
Can we see a look with the new boo I brown foundation
This channel is losing views and comments :/ whyyyy
LOVED the intro! It was spot on  🤣 I want to try this foundation so bad but I tried to get colour matched and the lightest is still a bit dark for me 😫😭 but that was me trying to match my face to my neck so maybe I should go back and try it anyway and just bring it down my neck!?? There’s hope yet!! 🙏🏼🙌🏼
This is my favorite foundation! I have super oily skin, DEEP acne scarring and I am also very acne prone. I have alot of redness, various colors/skintones in my face, black undereyes.. you name it. This foundation WILL cover it all, and also blend perfectly. It's not matte, but it's not shiny either. More like silk or satin on the skin. I have sensitive skin aswell, and this do not trigger that and do not give me more acne. It also sits all night through. I feel it oxidises a little on the skin to a darker color, but that's no problem for me, really. I buy so much from Clinique, I got a 50% off just today when buying a LOT of new stuff for the upcoming summer at my local mall that has Clinique. If they would sponsor me, I would GLADLY be sponsored, haha. Clinique is so underrated, especially since "everyone" is sponsored by them now a days, so those who haven't tried them just think that they are paid to say only good things. If that's right, well okay, but Cliniques products are the best. Their moisture surge, pep start hydroblur (primer&moisturizer), sun protection, foundation and waterproof mascara (for runny and watery and sensitive eyes) is seriously a game changer for me.
Love to see how you would do your mom’s makeup (this is coming from someone who, at 56 and despite good skin, can’t do my makeup like you without it looking cake-y)
Hi there,when I first saw this image I was thinking the hair looks awesome but then ,, I’m in the middle of moving and can’t find my typical foundations so I mixed a darker shade which was chantecaille and used that on the outside and along my cheeks and then I had a super light shade of Chanel vitalumiere Aqua . And just by chance by not having my typical foundations and contouring items I ended up doing just that and it looked great.  I did put in some shape tape light over my lids cuz the Chanel is not very thick but yeah this works really well.  I’m new on here ...  I’ve been doing my makeup and following lessons or tutorials since 2012 and have had some pretty heavy life experiences happen and should have been more active in the community but do what you want with your Channel. I gave another influencer nothing but thumbs up and thanks for the Information and got deleted.  I am new to posting like I said but thank s for your energy and making me feel good I liked tthe encouraging statements you left at the end of your video so thankyou for that.   I’ll be keeping up on your videos peppering around like I do with many different influencers . Love your hair too ☺️🎀‼️
Hi Kandee, can you do a makeup tutorial on how to keep makeup from melting,  i recently moved to  a warmer climate and im finding it difficult to keep my makeup from melting and my face looking greasy applying face powder only makes it worse   PLEASE HELP
So you calling me a dummy 😭
I would really love to get a makeover by youuu!
Love this short cut
That's it. I am buying that foundation today. In 3 colors!! Thankyou Kandee 💗💗💗
Kandee You are more Beautiful than you know!!
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Youuuuu❤️🌹❤️🌹❤️☺️☺️☺️☺️
I'd end up looking like a puddle of mudd lol
Wownu have the tiniest neck!!
What phone are you using now Kandee?
I only contour with foundation just because almost all kinds of contour products break me out while some foundations dont
pretty cool...I have the same haircolour as you got-and I dont like foundation on my hairline.How do clean it after finishing the look?
what lip color is that? looks good.
I prefer the girl on the right
Kandee land  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️do a house 🏡 tour
What happens if your older I'm 52. Does it matter the age for contouring?
Make up for the summer time heat please
Subscribed 😉
Ty bunches Kandee- i needed this far more than u know
I've been doing my makeup and brows since I was 14, im 29 now and I've gotten quite good at it but I can't contour for sh*t. It always looks muddy to me.
Cute idea IF u have other foundation laying around that’s the wrong shade other than that it’s 90.00 plus tax for contouring OR WE CAN GET A 6-10 shade palette to contour by every company in the world but of course girl if they giving it to ur awesome self why not promote it... right, what u gonna do on humid days in summer? Your contour I don’t believe will stay so ladies, use powder products in the summer cuz it’s gonna sweat off quicker w/ liquid products & it’s never true claims it won’t go anywhere!! Good idea if ur stuck w/ darker n paler shades👍
I have fair skin with cool neutral undertone. I can't seem to find the right shade due to it oxidizing on me. It's a total bummer. I remember when you first recommended this a few years ago. I went that day to get it. I LOVE the formula, but can't get the right shade. Dang it! (Said in a British accent. Lol.)
That is a CRAP TON of foundation, I would look like a major cake face
Is it that  good,  honesty?  So many YouTubers say they love a product  but it ends up not too be true.  I will give it a try because  It looks  orange  on some  people.
I never thought to use just foundations
Face looks 2-tone. Forehead dark. Not softened n2 light color.
I love that foundation. My absolute favorite, also. I have rosacea, and whenever I tell people that they are in shock. It covers it so well and I love that it is buildable. It also doesn't even cake up it makes my skin look great. :) just saying.... lol love you Kandee
Do you have to use a lot of the foundation to get full coverage or can you use a little bit and it will go full coverage too? You're kinda selling me on it haha! I typically go for a natural makeup look, like you can see my natural skin under it still, but I wanna try to see what I look like with a more full coverage!
Om goodness!!! Wow ok this week going to see if this works on me !!! I hope I can get so samples to play with and one thing What setting Powder is light so it won’t make ya look old and fall in fine lines ? Fantastic Video Thank You 🙏
It’s crazy how long I have been watching your videos ,  started watching you before you had your second child .  How old is your baby now .  Your still as beautiful as ever
This looks awesome... srsly, dunno why I never thought about it... all those beauty gurus keep throwing hundreds of products, brushes, while regular person cannot even afford basic set of good brushes
face looks dirty
I bought this foundation because I know how much you love it so I wanted to give it a try.. I do like it but for some reason I feel like it's too oily but it claims to NOT have any oil. So I'm confused about that. I do love the coverage though, just not the dewiness. But, anyway great video! Love you, Kandee!!
just tip to get your forehead to look a little more blended take a powder foundation a shade lighter on with a medium sized blending brush where the dark contour ends. You'll see the difference right away 😊
Ive heard clinique has very harmful chemicals in it so whats your take on it?
ok...soo i'm on my way to the store...lol
I wanted to love this foundation but the shade that most closely fits me makes me orange and I hate, hate that.  The next shade up is too light and the next shade down is too dark....
So I recently tried this foundation because you recommended it but unfortunately it wasn’t for me. I have an oily face and it really brought out the oils in my face. It probably works for people that don’t have oily skin.
My mom uses this foundation.
I am in need of what to do with my eyes now that I have had my left one reconstructed after melanoma was found on my inner upper eyelid and I literally have 2 different shaped eyes now that are really hard to make look normal!!!! HELP!!! I have small,hooded eyes and now its extra hard to make even and most of my already sparse eyelashes are gone on my left upper lid also,soooooooo I look lie I have been in a bar fight and put my makeup on while drunk.....so go without alot
Pretty easy for her since she already has incredible bone structure. Give me someone with a fat cheeks and puffy nose.
Kandee you're beautiful with or without makeup😎🤓😉
nice original intro sis
8:34 Is your neck ticklish?
What is the lipstick you are wearing? It's so pretty!
love your pink hair
Love love love
This is so random and probably is weird but your voice matches how you look without makeup
U were the first beauty guru i ever saw on youtube when i was a kid like 8 years ago! Ur an OG girl congrats
❤️❤️❤️❤️
If you sweat does it get white and drip off? I used a Clinique one time and I’m in humidville Southeast Florida.
Can you show us how you achieved your eye makeup in this video or an everyday eye look? I love the foundation so much but I can't find my pale shade. I have m tan shade and my kind of medium shade but not my pale shade.
Why are her eyebrows so high?
Oh thanks goodness! I’m a big makeup dummy! This is gonna help me so much. Thankyou!
I think all girls look better WITHOUT makeup.
I think I am lazy when I do this foundation contour lol this trick is time saver. Love watching your videos , you are the only youtuber that I havent unsub because you never make me bored. 😘
You're so Beautiful did you get lip injections???? Been following you forever XO
What translucent powder do you use?
I so wish I could pay you to come and teach me how to do my make up I’m 40 years old and I really struggle with my under eye area and I always end up looking like I’m 60 after I’m done doing my make up and I’m literally been in tears for months now it’s really completely torn me down all of my confidence is gone. It  makes me not want to leave the house anymore and I just don’t know what to do and you make it look so easy but I can never get it to look beautiful I just want to feel 40 and beautiful again😭😭
Can you tell us what made you decide to get lip fillers?
She never wets her BB and it drives me nuts.
i like your top can i know where is it from
its so simple but geniusssssssssssss love it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
PRETTY 🌹
Omg this seems like so much makeup. My face would suffocate
Thats a cool top, I like it.
If you go out in the sun you will literally melt. This is absolutely ridiculous.
Hello 😄
I’m lighter then the lightest shade they have. It oxidizes so badly.
last two months we got a heatwave in UK. I stopped wearing make up at all as it would melt down after 15 minutes anyway. And guess what-people aren't spitting seeing me without make up,my friends and family still loves me-enuf said .
donno why but my neck is actually darker than my face so i always darken my face to match my neck...
WATCHED THIS VIDEO WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT BUT HAD TO COME BACK FOR THE 4 MILLION! SO. CLOSE.
Is Clinique cruelty-free?
I had those freckles/sunspots too, was concealing them every day and it was a massive annoyance - got rid of them the easiest way. Just bought a skin tag/wart remover, doesn't matter which as long as it's a salicylic acid one, put the tiniest touch on each freckle, the whole thing where the skin is damaged/pigmented will take up the acid and turn dark brown, leave just 5-10 mins. Next day will turn black and Will look awful for about 4 days. But then the scabs just fall off and - nothing! Totally removed, no issue, no pain, no cost, just looking really bad for a few days until they fall off. Solved my whole pigmentation and sun damage issue at the cost of like $5. Dermatologists prol would not recommend but I do it every year and its f'ing fantastic and preventative re future skin cancers
Hey kandee, have your tried the jacklyn hill palette?
This is the worst contouring video I have ever seen I don’t know how this she is a makeup artist... that was shocking and super messy 😂
Nope, no way will I buy cosmetics tested on animals.
i wish it was cruelty free i really need a new foundation ☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
Oh Kandee, I love your humor! The intro killed me 🤣👏🏽 I would love a video (or an updated video if you’ve already done a similar in the last) about concealing under-eyes for mature skin or for 30-somethings like myself who just have very crease-prone skin. I’m a makeup artist and I still hate my under eyes... even when I was 18 and a senior in high school, the photographer who did our senior portraits photoshopped my under eyes 🤣 I was like “WHO IS SHE?!” 😂👏🏽 Thanks Kandee! Love ya girl!
She left her child alone to attend a beauty convention and was arrested for it. Can't believe you watch this criminal.
Did you get lip fillers? This makes me sad. You looked great before. Was hoping you would age naturally.
Skin discoloration kandee can be due to food deficiencies... or something like that along the line
0:30 😂
I’m def buying both colors.
Kandee can you wear this foundation if you have sensitive skin??
Do you have a hack or tip video for lashes? Or how you did your eye makeup in this video?!
Cakie
I'm obsessed with your lip colour. What are you rocking Kandee?
5:48 😂
Hi Kandee do you use sun screen before foundation? Because i have lupus disease i have to wear a high spf i use Neutrogena but my make up especially foundation never comes up right it get cakey and separate fast any suggestions for the freaks like me that have to use high spf Sun screen please? I miss the make up tutorials i hope you will do some and i love the show . love you 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚😙😙😘😘😘
I hope they come out with new shades, the lightest shade is too dark for me
This seemed super sloppy, I feel like for the sake of making it look so “quick and easy” to sell the product you sacrificed explaining WHY you contour or highlight, which isn’t that the point of a “how to” video? You’re showing us how to do something and explaining the why’s for the “dummies”? The way you slapped on that contour and put it everywhere so messily, the everyday person that’s learning how to do this would be so confused and would continue to struggle. It just didn’t feel like your usual content Kandy, but I already know people are gonna give you a pass bc you’re likable and quirky and all that good stuff.
I’m a guy who watched this video.. what a difference.. would date you after not before..
Yay! Kandee makeup video! click! I think I need to jump on the bandwagon and try the Clinique foundation :) I was wondering if anyone had any allergic reactions to the Kandee Johnson pallet that came out last year? I got really bad contact dermatitis on my eyelids and had to return it. Soo sad. But...I still love and support you Kandee <3
Damn, makeup does wonders 🙄
YOur lip hack...... they look larger but natural, can you use these colors too!!!
I tried this Clinique foundation  with the concealer but I hated it , I got a 7 day free trial  pot it made my face feel sludgy and dirty  I  have always  used Clinique foundation but this one is  not right on me, I am going to try a change like  mac or benefit 💖
How is this possible?? ... an artist, inspirational, sweet, expert and beautiful as Kandee, only has 3 million subscribers??? i just don´t get it!!
i LOVE kandee but i absouletly hate this foundation with a passion not sure if its a sponsered video I paid a hefty price for this foundation and have not used it to this day. Clinique is drying smells like chemical and horrible
So maybe I am worse at makeup than I thought, but I'd like a video, or tips, about how to not get face powder EVERYWHERE. My bf has literally rearranged the bathroom so his stuff is far away from my powder fallout lol I don't like using a beauty blender to apply it, so maybe that's where I'm going wrong (I use a thick powder brush) but I do try to "push" rather than "swipe" across my face, initially. Idk maybe it's just me.
You should do more makeup tutorials! I miss watching them!
I love love love beyond perfection foundation. I have not found a translucent powder than doesn't show my wrinkles, so I just wear it by itself.
Omg.  The beginning of this made me laugh so hard.  When I was a kid, I would ask my mom to write down that number!!! during all of those short infomercial things, & she would do it just to humor me, but would never call to order anything. Now it's an ongoing family joke.  Her name is Candy too!!! 💜
Ok... now I need to try that foundation.
So much product but it looks good
Love it 😍
hi kandee Johnson could you do a make over to my mom please she is pregnant
Entertaining and informative as always. I've seen allot of my bag videos recently. Do you already have one or could you do a video about your minimal everyday carry so far as makeup goes? Kind of like a face first aid kit in case things go wrong while one is out and about.
https://youtu.be/G8ohcD9kAAQ
Omg, she catfishes with all that makeup
i love your videos so much!!! your so good at makeup!! i wish you would post more. makeup helps me cope with my chronic stomach pain. i’m very sick with a really rare stomach disease. i love watching your videos. your intro was so funny ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ i’ve been a subscriber since 2010❤️❤️
How long does it normally take for the skin to warm up to absorb the color of the darker foundation?
Kandee, I really need your help! I cannot find one good video on how to actually do my eyebrows properly. I have eyebrows that go straight across with absolutely no arch. I need to know how to create that arch.
Clinique has a crappy shade range.Theres like one olive tone shade and it's dark
Please help me understand what I am doing wrong... I have fine hair all over my face and ANY foundation highlights all the hair! I hate it and never wear foundation because of this.... should I be using some sort of hair removal for my entire face? What am I missing?  Please help!!
Hi Kandee. My dad just passed last month and I'm requesting a video tutorial for grieving eye makeup. I already use Lancome & Dior waterproof mascara & Lancome' s waterproof concealer. And if you having tried them yet check out Kiko Milano Watershadows which are the most gorgeous individual shadows I've ever used. But since I love you & I know you know what it's like to lose your dad & you're my MakeUp Guru I would really appreciate a special Kandee Really Waterproof Even if You Just Lost Your Dad video. Ty Love you!
This looks great on camera with blinding circle lamps but I think I’d rather add a bit of bronzer. I’ll have to try it myself. Hey can you do a video for eyeshadow for hooded eyes.. like if you had a model with hooded eyes in a video and you did their eye makeup!?? Pretty please with a cherry on top! 🍒💖😘
I deleted my comment because I offended someone and it was not my intention. I’m so sorry 😢
I went to get color matched for Clinique foundations a few weeks back and I’m too white for any of their colors! 😭😭 I remember wearing a Clinique foundation a few years back I guess I just got really white haha
You are so funny
When she says there are no rules she ment besides the make up rule about not outing eyeliner on just your lower water line and no where else because you look like a 90's grunge monster and when it melts throughout the day you'll look like you've been punched. So stop it.
How do you not look like you got cake face with all that foundation?
Hello!!
LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
No.
I’m new not trying to hate but You look sooooo different without makeup
Kandee, I have a slight overbite and it causes the sides under my bottom lip to bulge.  kind of like jowls.  how can I contour that to make it less visible? it's a huge insecurity for me. please help! thank you
Left picture:  delicate refined beauty with a face that reflects personality, aliveness, and intelligence. Right picture:  blow up plastic doll with a face that shows no personality, intelligence, or life energy.
Hey wanted to say I absolutely adore your videos and you are #beautiful. Do you think maybe for a new video you can try cheap,  full coverage foundation and such. I have severe plaque psoriasis that creeps down my face. I can not afford any real make-up besides a few cheap lip colors. However I am a high-school student who gets stared at a lot do to my skin and it would make me feel very insecure and embarrassed. I would really like to invest and save up for a good full coverage foundation. But right now I can't really do that because I have responsibilities. My face would probably look bare since I have no other make-up but at least the foundation will cover my marks. I wanted to see if you would try some out because it would really suck for me to buy one and it not work and I wouldn't be able to get another. If you have already made a video for this please tell me and maybe somehow I missed it? I love you so much!!! Keep Smiling and Definitely Keep Inspiring!
Ok wthell.... When I put this much make up on my face it always always looks like I'm insane and have no idea what I'm doing.  How does it look sooooo fantastic on you Kandee???  And how do I..... Not look like a cakey crazy imposter????? I need help!!
I’m new to make up and tried the Clinique foundation and I quite liked it but was wondering if you had any tips for a beginners make up bag, like what products to use and skincare etc. Also, contouring for a slightly larger person?
Kandee! I sincerely miss your videos!
KANDEE, THAT LIP COLOR!!! HELP A GIRL OUT WHAT IS IT
Clinique is known to break people out
I love you
Fave nude lipsticks xx
How about an easy beginners glam prom look that will go with any dress? Prom's coming up. Can't afford a professional. Need help with my daughter's makeup.
Obsessed with this foundation! Can’t wait to try contouring with it
Hello Kandee, I am a golden medium and I have black dots from acne scars, I am not sure how to cover it. I have used the Huda beauty foundation all the way to Giorgio Armani and nothing. Please make a video indicATIng your tips on how to achieve a full coverage foundation, thanks!
you look nice WITHOUT the make-up....
this is to much foundation to many mistakes to much going on 👎👎 face looks cakey probably feels cakey mmm maybe u shouldn't be a judge since ur not all that good
💞💞
Where are the fitness videos!!?? Kandee you must!!!
How old are you?!...
I love that lip color! I put revlon chocolate Lipliner and smudge it or smear it and foundation inside like you do then fill in lip with infallible iced latte to look like your lip frosty glam look. That iced latte looks fantastic on my cheeks, lips and under my brows.

Def got lip injections
So when did you got lip fillers
Loooove!
u should do a updated lip contouring video...ik u did a how to make ur lips look bigger ages ago but u should do like a lip contouring video thts updated
But how did you do your lips?!
What is your lip color?
Kandee, Have you tried Fenty foundation? Would love to see a video of you trying Fenty and your thoughts on it.
Beautiful
Why is this trash trending
wtf are her eyebrows :(
kandeeeeeeee please tell me what youre wearing on your lips! thank youuuuuuuuuuu
Were you I insulted by madonnas insult to God? Don’t lose yourself
Kandee, I love this fountain too, bc of u, buttttt what I find annoying is the wand does Not reach the bottom of the bottle so we can't get 2 all of the foundation we pay for! 😣 Any ideas how 2 get 2 the bottom of their glass bottle?
are those just your lashes or is it eyeliner??
Wondering if you could share where you purchased your shirt you are wearing? Thanks!
Great video! What is that embossed stamped strap you are wearing?
😊Hi Kandee I know this is not on that video, but I just wanted to say that I’ve always loved Madonna since I was a child, I’m 42 years old now I watched that interview you did with her and Kim Kardashian and I was so upset at their behavior and how they completely ignored you. Honestly I lost all my respect for Madonna and I’m sorry that you had to go through that. I saw you trying to make contact with them by smiling and being the sweet person you are and it killed me. I just had to tell you this I’m sure you get so many comments that you might not even see this one but I wanted to let you know.😕
What’s on your lips?? Please do your fave pinky nude lipsticks and liners
Am I the only one that thinks you look better without any make up?
Kandee! Is there any where to contact you or a manager about a business opportunity?! I’m a mom of 3 who has been watching you FOR YEARS and I really want to see if you would try out my make up!
I love you Kandee but if you love animals why are you promoting clinique which is not cruelty free?
What color is on your lips?
Too bad Clinique test on animals...
I’m new to your station! You make this easy and fun! Thanks. Could you tell me your nail colors? Please. Thanks!
Who can live everyday with that much of a foundation on their face? Seriously. Real make-up artists makes it light ad bright and glowwy. But sure if you want to look unnatural when being face to face then ok. In the camera it doesn't show as much.
👍👍👍
Kandeeee what do you set with?
Niceee
Aw Kandee wish you weren’t plugging a company that tests on animals (Clinique). Sad face. #kandeewhyyouletmedown
Idk if u did a video on this but  I have the WORST time getting on fake lashes!! Any tips doll??
I look older than her and I’m 32 😓
Hiya, this process appears to be too difficult, there is a very easy way. Just go to google and type: "Blast4beauty". Here there are very simple tips which is very easy for you to implement.
Did she get her lips done?
I've wanted to try this but I still haven't.  I don't always wear foundation and when I do I use simply non toxic mineral powder.  It's hard for me to match my skin so I am afraid if I buy this it won't be able to find the right color.  I am fair with pink undertones!  It sucks! lol  my friend bought this foundation and she likes it so maybe someday I will.   Can we get more videos please?  I know you're busy but I do miss watching you.
Women are starting to look like clowns with all this makeup. You do not hardly see any natural women anymore. Glorified clowns.
Hello Kandee, do you like that foundation bettter than double wear foundation?
I want Kandee Johnson to sit on my face;)
👍😁🌈👏🍬
Hi, Kandee. Love, love, love ur personality. Great tutorial as always. Was the beauty blender dry or damp? Do u think that u can do a video showing us how 2 add pigment 2 foundation 4 a glowy look? Thnx, love.
Ugh my hair is black and any face makeup that gets on it makes my hair look like it greying
http://a.co/6VTjLBR
cosmetic tshirt
False advertising at its finest
before n after both look horrible.
te amooo kandee
Eyebrows plz
What hair color is that? Can I do it at home?
💜🍬💜🍬💜
Im the dummy!!! 😁
I can’t find nutty on the shades is it called something else? Never mind it’s not available on the Clinique website but is on Sephora site. Kandee is just want to say how much I enjoy your videos! I miss your vlogs so much! You literally help me try to be a better human being, your outlook is so positive and uplifting. I gained so much weight with my last pregnancy and 3 yrs later still have a lot to lose. I hated myself and have been so depressed, i went from a zero to a 18 now I’m a 14. I have felt so unattractive but watching you preach about loving yourself has helped me so much. I couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror now I can. I’m not trying to say curvy girls are unattractive it’s only me that I felt was unattractive. I’m learning to love my body because she deserves to be loved
X
So sloppy
You left out the word is for dummies. Makeup is a lie. You are a lie.
This was a hot mess, sloppy and amateurish. Why not take the time and do it right . That foundation is THICK CITY, concealer coverage so adding layer upon layer won’t translate well in REAL LIFE!  Cameras, TV and professional lighting make EVERYTHING look amazing .....was it must me or could anyone else not view this in HD ....it’s really blurry ( purposely??) You can tell how much of an afterthought this channel has become, she rarely uploads anything ....released the TooFaced collab and didn’t even create any looks or tutorials, strange really ...
Loved this so muchhhhhh. Sending love, youre amazing xoxo
I ABSOLUTELY love Clinique. I can’t go a day with out moisture surge. Love this foundation as well. Perfect video now if YouTube would just let us know when you have a new video. 🤔
is it fair to refer to those that don't know how to contour, or want to learn how to contour as dummies??????
I see universal doll of GODDESS EVE is also what I am from the family lineage of rose(disappear)
Seal(rose&space jam🔫
I like the way you talk ,gr8
Let’s switch noses 🙌🏻 You have the CUTEST nose in the world ❤️❤️❤️
Well, easy to say when your nose is already perfect. No matter what contour I do to mine it always looks like my nose with weird markings on it. Always. Ugh.
You have the perfect nose!
I am so going to try this, Kandee. So, it's never too late to have a button nose. Love watching you on Glam Masters. Blessings, and love...MaryEllen
Love your positive energy 🎀🌈💗
Totally random but I just realized I've been watching you for 9 years... You taught me everything I know about make up. All the tips and tricks I even taught my mom how to do lol. The most wonderful thing is that on my little sisters wedding day she wanted ME to do her make up, she trusted me on the most important day of her life which meant more than I could ever tell you. She said I made her look beautiful. But this is because of you, you gave me this opportunity and I couldn't thank you enough.  You were the one who made me interested in makeup because you have so much passion and it truly shows. You're a beautiful soul and I love you. ❤️ 💛 💚 💙 💜
That’s very interesting but could you try it on someone with an ugly nose? Like me? 😅
You already have a perfect nose!
Your tutorials always provide the best information, guidelines/steps and are so easy to follow along, Kandee! Really appreciate the time you put in to simplify something that looks complicated! Have a great week! xo
I was so happy to see a new video from you.
Get a model and do DOWN TURNED EYE MAKEUP!!!! Do 2 looks: one to make eyes look less droopy and upturned and one that is generally flattering on down turned eyes please Kandee! <3
😍😍I want A Celestial Nose🙋🙋💕💕💕  I'm sooooo here for this!! LOVE YOU KANDEE😙  Thank you for saving us from surgery😊
kandee, could you please do one that shows how to make your eyelids look bigger/less hooded?
Im loving watching you on Glam Masters but lets face it Kandee - YOU are the ultimate Glam Master!!!❤❤❤
This is amazing but what can people with a hump nose or downturned nose do? Im desperate to learn  🤥
Still very educational though   👍
Can you do a video on how to hide or disguise asymmetrical facial features? Like my nose is slightly crooked, I have a 'party brow' that is always up a little higher than the other... 

I love your videos and your channel really is the happiest on youtube!
That was amazing. I'm hoping you could do a tutorial to help me disguise the hump (I call it) on my nose. I hate side profile. Looking forward to seeing more like these
Lmao omg I thought kandee had some kind of a contraption on her nose in the thumbnail pic 🤣🤣🤣
I don’t see how this would help for someone with a bump on the nose. I guess nothing can really help for that other than surgery
I got the notification that you uploaded!!!! Yay
Droopy lids! Help! Mine are sooo bad I've considered eye surgery but...I too am really scared of going under the knife. I've seen others do droopy lids but I think I trust you the most for the how-to! Droopy lids, ugh :(
Kandee!! You just gave me the tips I needed so that I can create an Asian nose to blend in with my Asian family!! (I'm full Asian, I just inherited some hidden honker nose gene) Thank you so much!!!! hugs<3333
No kandee!! You are stunning, never ever change. There is only one kandee and you are beautiful ❤ big hugs 🤗
So helpful can't wait to try this in the morning!
Yay a new video you are my favorite YouTuber
drawing the horizontal tip line doesn't work for me at all! It makes my nose look short and upturned. I prefer longer lines
Thank you for the tips. 
I love you so much Kandee 
I watched earlier but since the video was reuploaded I'm watching again. XOXO
Elizabeth Taylor is the most beautiful frickin woman who has ever existed on the face of this frickin PLANET!!!!!...... just had to get that out there. Lol. 😂😂😂 but no really, her face and nose was perfect. ❤ My mom was always told she looked like Elizabeth Taylor and I agree. My mom has the perfect little nose, but unfortunately a jealous friend of hers growing up told her that her nose looked weird, so she's always been self conscious over NOTHING BUT a perfect nose. So sad.
Video on contouring big long pointy noise please! Please! Please!
Loved this! Definitely going to give it a try!! I would like to see how you can create the illusion of a more chiseled chin, and a little more lift to the eyelid. Thank you for helping us get that perfected nose! Love you Kandee!!!!!!!!
When your name is Celeste and Kandee keeps saying Celestial 😍😍😍
Kandee 💟 you were the very first YouTuber i ever watched! It was like 3 years ago when i first saw one of your videos and I became obsessed with your videos and your awesome positivity and charms ♥ I adore you very much to this day and however I now watch so so many other YouTube girls and guys I always come back to your channel and you (and your snaps) always bring a smile to my face! I just wanted to let you know that....
You're amazing keep up the good work! 
Lots of love from Germany❤❤❤
Love this video!  Your tutorials are the best!
Please do a video for those of us with large eyelids (ex. Uma Thurman) who want to minimize their eyelid space.  Thank you!!!
My heart smiles when I see that you have a new video up,   Thank you for sharing your talent/passion.
Hugs back  to you :)
What is this lip color!?!??! It's gggggorgeous
Thank You.Your make up,skin,is flawless.Great tips.Be blessed always.

KANDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I HAVE MISSED YOU SOOOOOOOOO MUCH

Thank you for keepin it classy on YouTube💗
I really can't believe that u don't like ur nose.. it's so beautiful..
Very helpful.. Perfect way to explain how to do that..
I was always confused about contouring the nose
Thanks for breaking it down 👍👍👍👍👍
Big thumbs up!!
That part about the personality and nose type is idiotic.
Thank you! I tried this and it works beautifully. It gets better with practice. Please do more. Hooded eyes, can you correct asymmetry?
Ummm quietly whispers I rlly love my nose. It's so cute and perfect.. pls don't hate me there r many things I do not like about me
I'm watching glam masters and Kandee you touch my heart. During the second challenge you and a contestant were talking about your father's and you had so much compassion. I love you♡
Always great info from you!  Could you PLEASEdo a mature face video with contour sculpting like this one?  I started following you again after a recommendation from "Rockstar mom" channel who is over 60...help us!  Lol
Thanks, Kandee...you are so lovely.
So happy about this video! Please do more tutorials/lessons! I love you, been watching since 2010 and you introduced me to the FUN side of makeup!! ❤️
You are just BEYOND BEAUTIFUL 💖 Can't wait to learn more tips! Love ya 😘
I started this and I got complements on my nose! 
Thank you. Your the best !
You explained this perfectly. Thanks Kandee ❤
Genius!  Your makeup technique is flawless!
Kandee i love how you explain what type of brush you're using and why and the same with colours.  That means those of us at home can see what we have and follow your tutorial 

Other youtubers just quote brands and names without explaining WHY they're using that shade/brush.  So you can't follow unless you buy what they use

Thank you for thinking of what people watching your videos need to know 😘 
Xxx
I was so happy when I saw this upload!! Love you girlie and missed seeing your face on here. Your videos bring so much joy and it makes my week to see your name pop up!
💗 I hope you're feeling better!  Your face is perfect, just like your heart. Love you! Remember that you are awesome! 😘
Girl, you rock!!! Love the perfect little nose you created! You are awesome!
Love you Kandee!!❤❤ thank you for this video great job 👍😙

You are so entertaining but at the same time incredibly informative and helpful. Love your channel!
Just awesome! i was always worried about my nose
Can you do a video for protruding eye makeup
I have a really upturned nose and was looking for contouring to make it look more straight 🤦🏻‍♀️ but if I do the opposite of what she just did it might work!
You have the PERFECT nose! And this was so helpful!
I'm sorry about ur dad. Until u meet agai❤️
I tried it, I loved it, this is staying in my makeup routine! ♥️
You should do a tutorial on creating an oval face shape! I would love to see that! 😍 or how to slender down a jawline/cheeks!
Double eyelids w/o the surgery. Thank you 😊

First to comment and I love your videos
Love this! Thank you for such an in depth tutorial! Can you do a video on how to make a face shape slimmer with contour?
I love this tutorial! Can you pretty please do one on disguising a double chin? It is the only thing that bugs me about my face.
Love you so much, you explain everything so well!!
Your looking beautiful 😍😍
Yasss!  Love you Kandee!!  This editing is on point!! 💕💕💕💕
Kandee you are just gorgeous!!!! Thanks for this video, I do look forward to more like them!
This is literally my nose, a combination of both. Guess I have the perfect nose. Guess that's why I like it. lol
Omg I love this!  

Btw Kandee, what surgery could you do on your nose?  YOUR nose is what ppl request!  It’s perfect
Do my 👃 please.. Hated mine since elementary school. (38yr) . I've grown into now but still wouldn't mind a trim💋
Kandee, gurllll I've missed you. So happy to see you!
this video was so helpful thank you!
Kandee you are SO gorgeous inside & out. NEVER change for anyone!! You have such a great heart, are an inspiration to many including myself, an AMAZING makeup artist, & truly caring person that was put on this Earth for a unique purpose that only you can fill. Know that your Creator is raising you up to fulfill that purpose for such a time as this so when you have to walk through an obstacle it is only so you can grow, become stronger, & be the overcomer needed to walk out that purpose in total confidence & faith. NEVER doubt your amazingness & don't stop being the wonderful amazing classy lady you are!! Thank you for sharing parts of your life & journey with us & be blessed. Best wishes & much love to you!! 💖💓😍😄😊😘
Saw this one 4 hours ago. This one just showed up on my notificatio b.s. about 30 mins ago.  Great to see another Kandee video!!

Omg yes this was super helpful I'm definitely going to try this I love this so so so much
Omg this video soooo helped me with my nose contour.its always been a struggle 4me.
Oh my word Kandee I thought in your intro that your nose was already done.. you have such an adorable perfect nose before you even do your contour! So beautiful 😍
Omg I’m SOOO glad you’re doing these again! I hope you can update your tutorials they are my favorite!! 😍😍

Your videos are always so helpful! Thank you!!! 💗💗💗you!
FIRST!!💕ilysm!❤️😍
Tati has the snub nose. ...am i right? Likes like the picture anyways i think!
I was notified the first time about you uploading a new video but had to search around to find it. I watched then you deleted it lol just as I was going to like it. So I watched it again when you re-uploaded it! Cause you’re awesome and I love you 😘
Honey I fell in love with you even more. I am by no means a make up girl but I’ve been watching you for years. I love your transformations. When I saw you on Glam Masters I was sooo excited my sister was looking at me all crazy. I watched a video you did two yrs ago and you talked about having a sling shot moment. I have to tell you that WHOLE ENTIRE video was inspiring. I thought wow God is so amazing the enemy really tried her but your love and your faith Man it’s Awesome. If I could just tell you what that video meant we would probably create a new lake. But thanks that really was needed and it was on time for the season I’m in now. I two years late but God’s timing is always the right timing. Blessings to you
May I ask....do you have botox? Or fillers ? As your skin is perfect❤ Great video xx
Ha here before 1k
Thank u for the vid Kandee girl💖!
I literally missed you. This will help me perfect my nose. Love you Kandee ❤️❤️❤️
your nose is perfect! and yourself :) I have watched your videos since 2007 and still a big fan <3
Yesss! Great tutorial. I love when I learn stuff for real people. Looking human and healthy is perfection. Instagram looks is weird
Will definitely try this next time. Thanks for the awesome tip
I've always contoured my nose like this. I always wondered if it was normal to do it that way...Haha! You're the first I've seen do a tutorial for it. Yay! I love LOVE love your videos!! Always making people smile! (I also LOVED seeing you on Revenge Body as an artist!!!)
OMGosh, bawhaha!! The disclaimer in the description box has me rolling!!😂 “Not even a nose hair”😂🤣😅😭💀 I absolutely loved this video..SO helpful and informative!! Please, please do more..I miss your tutorials!!🙏🏻🙌🏻 Love you SO SO SOOO much, Kandee!!💖😘 xoxoxoxo🍭🍭

Help for hooded eyes!
Candy you have a cute nose! It's like perfect 😄
You have a button nose!! Am I crazy cuz you always said you weren't fond  of it and it take a picture of YOUR nose to the plastic surgeon if I ever had a nose job....just so u know
Kandee I love watching you on Glam Masters. I’m so happy for you after watching you on YouTube for years. Your the bomb. Keep up the good work. I must say I’ve learned much from your YouTube tutorials! 👠💄👜🌹
LOL you can see the dark line LOL dont think I want to walk around like that
i always hated my neck...its not saggy but always been  low curved. till i realized it was my granddaddys who passed. my grandparents were my best and only influence in my life. my good heart came from them
Your two faced collab was excellent!
I loooove your nose!!!❤️
I have a potato nose!  How do I contour it to make it look less potatoey?
This is the best nose contour video ive seen hands down
How Would You Shape Your Eyebrows For This Nose ? Like, Where Would They Start?
Big Hugs!!
-xx's
6:09 "So it looks like you're a real human" XD I love her!
This is already how I contour my nose because I found its what looks best on me
This is so informative thank you!
Came from IG love you
Love youuu but please lower the light :( i cant see
Best video ever!  Thank you sweety. Love you Kandee! Gbu
You learn something new every day! Love you so much Kandee 💕
I have a celestial nose! I will think of this when I look in the mirror and don't like it. Love you.
Wow. That v shape is a miracle for my nose! I never did that before
Love you and your dad’s nose so much!!!! You have the perfect face period. Brows. Nose. Eyes. ... you name it! 
Your tips are so wonderful. Is it possible you could show, or just tell me right here, lol, what if my nose (the tip) slants towards one way. A crooked nose. 😔Help please
Please do a tutorial on your makeup in this video! It's so bright & pretty!! 😘😘😘❤️
🐝 yay it's up! No more sad dancing bees for Kandee ❤️ lol
"give it a bit more buttony-ness now"
You are the most adorable girl ever! I'm totally fan girling on you! 😘
Dylan o'brien has a perfect nose. It's confirmed.
Yes, I do have a special feature aka HOODED eye lids.☹️ I'm seriously considering ✄✄✄ however if there is a way to prolong the inevitable, I'd love to learn. Thank you KJ!  Your gorgeous smile always makes my day.💘
You have the most perfect little nose...It's so cute....😍
I like my nose, the only thing I'd adjust is a slightly bigger Top lip to match my bottom lip ✌😊 great job
I love you, Beauty Queen!💋😘💖
Thanks so much for this awesome video!! I’ve got a question though. For me, the depression in my nose is closer to the center of the bridge than I’d like, and I’m not sure if there’s a way to hide the shadow it creates, since I’d like to contour farther down. It’s prominent and I’m not a fan 🙁.

Any help would be great!
I just watched the intro and I just remembered I had candy in my backpack haha. Thank you for reminding me Kandee 💟
0:22 Well said, Kandee.  👏  U have a pretty nose.  U R very pretty inside and out.  I like your nails.  And your hair in this video is the Perfect length and colour.  I love it.  😍💓  I 💖 U, Kandee.  Therefore I want us 2 meet 1 day.  ☺
I wish I could change my downturned hooded eyes without surgery! You are so talented....😘
You’re so pretty and sweet! I love your videos!😄❤️
I love seeing you on glam masters.
I have a button nose and green eyes. Both rare. I'm special. 😜
Hey Kandee! I got notified for both! 🙂💕 Hope everyone can see it & watch it now 😊 I love you! ❤️😘 Please make sure you take care of yourself too- I feel so bad every time you get sick! 🤧🙁 Love you so much gorgeous! 😘💕💕
What a fun video,I was mesmerized! Would love to see more like this! xoxoMarjorie
Bee is working! Snapchat squad where are you!
Hi again 😄
Best video ever! Can’t wait for more!!!
WHAAAAAT!!???? I ACTUALLY HONESTLY LOVE MY NOSE SO MUCH!!!!
Oh I have a celestial/snub nose, I never knew that, interesting.
Edit: I just realized that when I rub my face I push my nose upwards, probably how I got the shape lol.
Here's me hating my button nose haha my whole family has a beautiful  Italian nose that I envy so much!
Excited for any video you make!!! Love you Kandee!
First of all God bless your dad's soul and mine as well 😇 and all the souls out there... and i swear the same thing happened to me 💓 when i found out that my nose looks like my beloved dad i couldn't contour it any more.
needed this. i got that severus snape nose 😂
You're so talented!  Can you show us how to "fake" a chin dimple?  I always wish I was born with one!  💖
No, not everybody has that little depression on the nose. . Your nose, for example, is perfect, you already have the shape that you're trying to achieve, you're just marking it again. I do not have that "depression" above the tip, that's why it's WAY too difficult for me to contour, because my nose is aquiline nose. The bridge goes all the way down the tip. It would be interesting if you'd do this tutorial on different people with different types of noses.
I just love you kandee ♡ you're the first YouTuber I ever watched, and I've learned so much from you. I love how true to you your videos still are. I feel like I can't remember the last time I saw a real tutorial in my needed ♡ thank you for what you do!
"You want to make it look like you're a real human" LOL Kandee I love you!!!
Thank you for the video!! I love tutorials like this ❤ Not only for myself, but for doing other people's makeup 😊 I think it would be great if you did a "plastic surgery" makeup series 👍
I have been trying and trying to learn how to contour my nose..thank u so much for this kandee! Love you!! ❤❤❤
I didn't realize I had a celestial/button nose...
hey Kandee, remember me? LOL 🤣 I said that you already have the perfect nose 😍😍
I  have a big honker, if I focus on how big it is I'll never be happy! 🤣🤣 just luv your self
Hi Kandee.... Congratulation for you....This is first your  video that I watch.... You are so pretty.  And sweet..  You have now another fun..  Bye bye from Rome
love this kind of video...I cant wait for my button nose
Yay!  A new video.  Miss your videos.  Love these tips!  I actually like my nose though. ☺️
I wish you'd do a video on applying make-up for the office.  Florescent lighting is so harsh & my make-up looks great when I leave the house, but it looks totally different when I get to work.  Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us.  I love your videos.
You have THE cutest nose, I've always thought this!!  No surgery needed <3
I love your cute nose💕. Good to see you again and love the pink hair💕
You are just amazing,where did you learn all these great techniques? Love watching your videos.i'm old enough to be your grandmother but still really enjoy putting on makeup.
Leave it to @kandeejohnson to give us a fabulous art school lesson. Always a teacher. <G> Thanks for sharing!
I love it when you do makeup tutorials!!  Also, I love your earrings!!!
I love how even though you’re super successful now you’re still the same, same adorable, humble loving girl that uploaded that first super blurry video. I am so happy for you and I think you seriously deserve all the good things that are happening to you now. I’ve been following you since pretty much the beginning and I love seeing you succeed ❤️
Haha I got a button nose, and I'm happy with it...always have been. Got lucky I got my mum's nose and not my dad's
love those earrings your so beautiful
Love this thank you!!!💜
we love a contoured kween ❤❤❤
Kandee is a legit beauty expert. A true beauty guru. She's so knowledgeable.
Absolutely beautiful in this video😍😍😍
your nose is adorable!!!😍😍
Can you show how to make a face look more symmetrical?
I saw it the first time and loved it. I was so sad it disappeared, but now I'm happy again! Love you and your videos💕💕 btw,  the picture of the celestial nose, am I the only one who think it looks like Lana del Rey's nose?
I started doing that little arch shape contour after you did it on one of the Merell twins and loved it!! Cutest thing ever!
Small and narrow noses are not the epitome of beauty. I hate when people perpetuate this myth.
WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR EARRINGS?! 😍😍😍
I love your nose and would love learn how to contour my nose like yours..... Or specifically Elizabeth Olsen's, as we look almost identical but our nose shapes are different!
Yay finally, I found the video 💕
According to this, I have a celestial nose because it meets all the criteria (dent in middle, upturned tip, bulbous on the end), but I just don't see it lol I've always felt like I have a gigantic nose! Buuut I do love how it photographs from the profile angle, so I'm happy lol
Please do tips for people with uneven eyes!  Thanks for your videos I really love them!  💗
Great video! I can't wait to try this! Kandee is the queen of makeup. Period.
You look so pretty 😘❤️😘💪🏻
Hi kandee I love you so much you are amazing 💖, I see you on TV you are amazing and beautiful 💋💗
Thank you!!!
What eyebrows are you wearing on lid 😍
I think your own nose is beautiful 💁🏻
you should really leave out the horizontal line. Gives you a hedgehog look
Wow!!!!!! I had no idea you could change the shape of your nose! I’m contouring clueless though 
Very cool...makes me want to try it!
I’m a traditional artist and portraiture is my favorite subject but I just want to add that all of your advice crosses over. This is excellent. My favorite nose is Lana Del Rey’s. 😍
Also Kandee, you have the CUTEST nose in the world! never change it hahaha
when you already have both types but your nose is ethically huge
ive never heard of a celestial nose but yes teach me queen!!! lol
Loving the makeup & hair 💟💛💜💟💛💜
What about a video on contouring BIG noses. I haven't figured out the best way to contour my shnozzle!!
Well I’m glad I’ve been doing something  right because this is how I always contour my nose lol 😂
I like my nose but I might try this just for funsies.
I love the idea of teaching people to do makeup tricks instead of going under the knife!
U have the most perfect nose already!
Your nose is actually very pretty imo ♡
I followed...I got the cutest little button nose, a Kandee designed nose!  Thanks you are a love! : )
I would love to see a tutorial on hooded eyes please!
Personally I love her nose!!! It’s so cute and pretty
Wow!!!!!! I had no idea you could change the shape of your nose! I’m contouring clueless though 
Very cool...makes me want to try it!
I’ve loved my nose all my life and now I’m super stoked to know I have the “perfect” nose
One for a broken crooked nose plz!!!!!!! Love your videos 💕💕💕💕💕
Great video! And your hair 😍😍😍
Ughh 😍 your hair is so pretty!! ❤️
The love of my life since 2010. <3
No notification and it didnt show up in my subscription
I tried and it made my nose look more bulbous:( Help!
This does not work on every nose shape lol I would look insane
Can you please do a tutorial with your I want kandee palette? I rememeber you saying you mix different shades to make new colors and I can't figure it out 😔
I seen you on The Real the other day and felt like such a proud little sister! I was like “omg! It’s Kandee! She’s on t.v” 😍
I always think your nose is perfect
Well who knew my nose would be desired🤷🏼‍♀️ I hated my nose as a kid
i think your normal nose is so beautiful!!
I see it now! I need to try this on my big nose, see if it can become "cute". Lol. I like how you have embraced your nose because it reminds you of your dad. I wish mine did.
You're so beautiful😍 like flawless, I missed you😒 I hope your knee is healing up fast🙏 and I've been watching your show Glam Masters! 😇I hope you don't mind you're my profile pic because you're my inspiration💁💋💄👑 love you Kandee!💞🍥🍡🍬🍭
Does anyone else remember Kandees plastic surgery with makeup videos from a longgg time ago? (8-9years??) 😂 I totally first learned how to contour my nose from Kandee! 😂😍

(Also,I didn't get notified for this upload 😟 I did get a notification for the first one though!)
I believe I have a  celestial nose! Just a bit bigger lol😍 I love it because it's my dad's nose! ❤️
How about a video about how to contour a round face into a slimer face like I kind of want a korean v shape face Please                                 I love you ! 💕💕💕i struggle with this so much and would really love help on this
I love you and I am a new subscriber to your channel!!
I'd love a video on how to lift and bring the undereye forward. My eyes are deep-set so I often look tired when I'm not. I'm not ready to commit to fillers!
Your comment about your dad made me so emotional. I have 2 different shaped nostrils. One is rounded & one is slanted. I was told I have a deviated septum & had thought about getting a nose job to make it symmetrical. I didn't realize this till the day before my dad passed last year, but when I was placing his oxygen into his nostrils I learned after 38 years I had his nostrils. I am amazed that talking about this tears me up so much. He wasn't able to talk but I said, "it's you, I have your nostrils!" I began to laugh and saw him smirk a lil smile acknowledging me. That was one of the last moments with my dad. Needless to say, I now treasure its uniqueness. 
Thank you so much! You are one and a million. I adore you, your strength and your talents!
Can you do a video on making your jaw more angular? I’ve always been one to like to have a sharper more chiseled looking jawline. I like to bring out my androgynous features that I got from my mom.
Great tips on contouring!  I'm loving the Too Faced I Want Kandee Palette.  Such beautiful colors!
Wow that was so cool! Your nose is already PERFECT in my opinion but I really did see how it changed as you contoured! I'd love love love if you could do a video on how to make the eyes look bigger and rounder like ALOT of people try to get! I think so many people would watch and love that video...I definitely would! Thanks so much!
Ur nose is so perfect I want one  just like yours honestly
Is there a way to contour your chin to bring it out just alittle?
Gonna give it a try!  Love your makeup look!
hey I was wondering if you'd ever do more creative makeup? ik you're super busy but I haven't seen that in a long time.
You are so pretty...and your kindness and personality make you even more beautiful. Please talk about covering double chins and brightening deep set eyes. I have lots of rough features. Lol.
I wish I could have you be my "surgeon"!!! Love your tutorials and love Glam Masters!! Could you do a video on carving cheekbones??  I have none..lol!
I love this!  Can you do one on defining jaw line for older women?
I will be trying this! Thank you!! Can you eyeshadow for hooded eyes.  A very dramatic style please.
I saw the video before you reloaded it. It worked for me!
Kandee I watch your videos since back at the time when you made nail videos 💋
Can u do this with glasses 👓. Help please ❤️
Welcome back kandee. I’ve missed you. Can we have a life update video?
She has such beautiful teeth, my god 😍😍
Wait, did I miss something...I thought she was doing both noses..but all saw was celestial WTH 😟
How does this not have more views?!?!?!?!!? I'm sharing this everywhere!!!!!! Youtube is wilding!!!
yes please more contour videos plsss xoxox
I think you have the perfect button nose! I wish I had it!
I tried this technique and I don't think the arch shape at 5:31 looked quite right on my nose. The bottom of my nose is a little wide and I felt like it made the width stand out? :/ Kandee's result looked great on her though.
Love this! More videos like this, please! <3<3<3
Kandee can you show us how to make the skin around your mouth look more lifted? I have found as I'm aging that I'm losing elasticity there... I'll probably have jowls when i'm older 😕
Please!!! What do I do if I already have to much upturn?? I need to go downturn!! Where do I put the contour? Anyone!
How to create the perfect eye shape with contour. ie: almond shape......... changing your eye shape for day to day use
thanks for vid pretty lady
Make up for protruding eyes (not how to get protruding eyes..  like how to apply eyeshadow that is most flattering when you have protruding eyes).
Ha ha you have the most beautiful nose!!! I never understand why u don’t love it!
Oh please do one on making your under chin not so saggy like to hide a double or sagging chin 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜
I love your nose! It's perfect!
Wonderful tutorial!
My nose as changed over the years, from both a car wreck as well as just plain old drooping from aging, and I have not been happy with it for a few years.
I can't wait to try this today, thank you!

I would love to see a video on contouring for all face shapes.
My face is thin, and contouring has made it look gaunt in the past but I hate how flat my face looks without it.
Not to mention this not so strong looking jawline....ah, gotta love middle age :)

So yes please, start that new "makeup plastic surgery" series, I'M IN!!! 
Hope you have a lovely week!
Love and Hugs!!!!
Thanks so much for making these kind of videos! I've been wanting to learn how to do this but I've been so scared lol I'm also going to watch your face contouring video right now cuz I've tried to get it down & just can't seem to make it work lol but I'm still learning about my face shape too cuz I've been losing weight lately.... Thanks a again Kandee!! ❤️🤗❤️
Gosh you're nose is adorable! I hate my nose for sure! How do you disguise a deviated septum?
You DO NOT have a pig nose, silly girl!  I had a nose job when I was 19 (many moons ago!  😂) and YOURS looks way cuter than mine!  You are so pretty it's slightly redic! LoL 😊. I would give anything to have your talent to apply makeup, as well! Keep up the good work!  👍
Can you do one to hide the hump on the nose?. Thank you! Love you!!.
great video i lovee this i dont ever know how to contour my nose but i love nose highlight !!
Got the notification kandee!!
I've never contoured my nose 😂
Super helpful video kandeee, thaanks :)
Great video Kandee! When Ive tried to contour the sides of my nose it totally created that beak look! lol
How to make your lips look bigger please!! ❤
Love your videos!! What is the lipstick you are wearing?! 💗💗💗it!

"So it looks like youre a real human" ohh kandee i love your humor!! ❤

Omg, yasss! More videos like this please
You're amazing!
Yes please do more of these!
I must know that lip color and liner!! I LOVE it!!!!
I feel like she is incredibly over rated
Your 're so pretty I would marry you! Your simply the best! No one compares to you...
You always look beautiful to me
You have a perfect nose !
Um you have the most perfect nose ever! I always wondered if you had had it done especially since you live in Cali
Where do you get your facts? #inaccurate
Highlight should never be on the tip of the nose.
Do black noses 👃🏾 lol
I love your small nose. It is perfect. I hate my nose
You literally have a snub nose  xxx
Lol I love love you but I love my nose and your nose is beautiful too!
Please do a video on hooded eyes!
you are gorgeous, i woulnd change a thing about you, in or out....
Omg 1 day late but I have the same nail color
When I clicked on the notification it said the poster removed the video so I came to your page and found it myself because I can’t miss a Kandee video!
Ok Kandy!!   WHAT IS THE DEAL????
You have NOT aged in years....what sorcery is this????   LOL. In FACT,  I think you are aging backwards!!!

Maybe we need an updated skincare routine to find your secret for this fountain of youth??? ♡♡♡
The one thing I like on my face is my nose lol 😆.. everyone always compliments me on my nose as weird as that sounds..
Lmao I was already so self-conscious about my huge nose.....now I'm even worse....and I didn't think I could feel any worse about it lol
LMAOOOO I have this so-called "celestial" nose and I got bullied through school and told I had a pig-nose sooo
I'm so going to try this! My nose contour is definitely what I struggle with the most! Thank you Kandee!!
I just wish I had a pretty nose profile :(
YOU haven't seen my nose!!  :( I would never have a cute button nose!
You’re so gorgeous. I love all your videos ❤️❤️
Very informative video, Kandee! I do want to point out that these are strictly Western beauty standards, though.
You are sparkling and awesome.
Hope you’re feeling better today Kandee. 😘I have big, deep set eyes so they are different to hooded eyes so any tips would be good. Also get rid of my double chin. I put dark concealer there but can still see it 🙄. Huge Hugs xxx
KANDEE❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️ I’m super self conscious about my right side profile because my right brow bone is a tad more forward than my left. I’m the only one who notices it of course but what tricks do you have for that? I feel like my face is lopsided 😕

Also I love you!!!!!
I used to love my nose but as I get older it looks more bulbous and turns down when I laugh. I’m talking to my Dermatologist next visit to see if filler or Botox will help 🤞🏻
This was so helpful! Thank you Kandee!
"so you look like a real human" lol love you Kandee. I feel like my nose is not contourable. I have tried and I think my nose is just so defined naturally that the shape can't appear different no matter how much I change the line. I have a bump on the upper part of my nose and it's pointed down at the bottom. I always do makeup looks but never post them because I'm really insecure of how my nose looks in photos.
Ääähm Kandee, you show us (of course huge-) hollywood icons with their perfect noses, but your nose is at least the same perfection as them, your natural contours are so fine and beautyfull, you are the best example!;)
Kandee I just came to watch this from Snapchat. I am just posting a comment on here just to thank you for your posts on Snapchat. Today was a very rough day for me. I cried for many hours and felt so alone. Eventually I got to my phone and scrolled around, one of the first things I saw was your snap chat “you are not alone ❤️” as well as the two others. You may not know me but I feel like it reached out to me for a reason. Thank you for your videos, your smile and your good heart. I just wanted you to know that what you say and do does help others. So thank you!! ❤️
Lips 😘😘
Kandee thank you so much for this video!! I’ve been lead wrong by all these contour videos and couldn’t figure out why my long pointy nose isn’t being contoured right. My boyfriend has a perfect nose that legit looks contoured and my niece has the cutest button nose. Now I can be as adorable as them! 💕🎀
this is one of the only tutorials of nose contouring i've seen that actually turned out nicely
Can’t wait to try this technique!!! 😍
I want to see how to contour a long narrow face to make it look shorter and wider
I'm not a big fan of button noses and I really don't think they are cute. Maybe I'm alone in that opinion. And that's ok. I think a tutorial on eyebrows would be good. I never know what kind of product to use or if I'm doing it ok. 👍🏻
Kandee, you're so beautiful inside and out! Can you contour my heart? Haha... you do tho! TBH, I have hooded eyes but dramatic love cat eye and cut crease looks. Can you help advise me how to avoid bringing my lids downward...thank you I love you sooo much!!!
XOXO Allie with a button nose 😻
Wow ! Love this ! Thanks for the tip! I hate my nose so much and hopefully this will help !! Love you Kandee🌸💞
Sensational video. thanks.
"So you look like a human" 😂 I love you Kandee!
thats funny you say that because I actually love your nose I have seen your nose in pics and thought wow what a fantastic nose !
Great tutorial 💖your nose is perfect! My maternal grandma’s side of the family have button noses whereas my dad has a fleshy nose. So I ended with a upturned fleshy nose. Used to hate it because I thought I looked like a pig. So I admit I do the highlight on the bottom to try to make the tip look longer. And try to contour the side to make the base look less wide. Still looks wide though
I'm obsessed with noses .. but my own haha
I have watched this five times already and saved it!!!! This is the most INFORMATIVE tutorial I have seen on nose contouring, Kandee you are always the best!!!!! I love you!!!!
Your eyes are so pretty oh my goodness
THANKKKK YOUUU!!!!
Two times in one day?! Two times the Kandee!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Finally! Mama Kandee showing us how to make our noses look realistically contoured and not like snatched Barbie noses. Nothing wrong with snatched IG noses, but this is refreshing! Love you Kandee! ♥️😇☺️
Bless you, Kandee for keeping your nose "natural". I too have a nose similar to my dad's who has also past away when I was a late teen. Some people have said mean things about it, but that's their problem, not mine because I have my dad's nose and it's 1 of the positive memories that I have of him. XOXOX
I would love to see a tutorial on hooded eyes please!
She is just as cute, and just as sweet and genuine now as she was waaaay back in the day!
the beauty guru of beauty gurus. salud!
ps honestly this was the best nose contouring video i have ever come across on youtube.. u never disappoint my friend <3
Why isnt this trending right now 🙌🙌🙌🙌 great video as always
I love these type of videos
LIPSTICK???
The best nose contouring video ever! Thank you!
I really think that your nose looks amazing
I can’t be the only person happy with their nose!? 🙌🏻 I contour the side but that’s it.
Definitely want to see more "plastic surgery with makeup"!!!
WOW!!! I have always thought that you were stunning but this new look of yours is off the charts. You nailed EVERYTHING!!! This is your best hair colour in my opinion and the braid looks killer with the colour. Your makeup is so perfect and your skin so flawless and I would die to have your Elizabeth Taylor nose. Your nose is perfect. So are your teeth... should I go on. lol If I could pull off this entire look I would but I can't so I will have to come back to this awesome tutorial just to gawk at your beauty. My life motto has always been... if you are thinking something nice about someone... tell them, they just may need to hear it. So I felt compelled to tell you. This is the most stunning you have ever looked and you are so talented and sweet to boot. Love your videos. Sorry for the short novel. 💗
I do love your idea of the plastic surgery with makeup series!!  
Is there any makeup trick to help hide the indentation & shadow of undereye circles? I use powder & sometimes it hides better then others.  BTW I love your nose & you have a gorgeous smile but I understand the complexes we get from things a sibling said to us growing up.. I have a brother!!... & it just sticks with you no matter what. Love your videos!! Thanks
What if you have a long nose 🤥 wouldn’t that make your nose look way longer.? Because I cannot stand mine. I look like a Pinocchio 🤥 😭
Yes ty 💋💯❤️🤯
I think you have the perfect nose and would love to have your nose size and shape. Crazy how we can't see how lucky we are. Everyone wants what they can't have I guess.
Your nose Is far from imperfection Kandee.
I have an upturned nose and hate it because people have called me ski slope my whole life. 😥
Dry helpful!
best nose contouring ever!! I never liked using cream to contour I'm going to try powder next time I contour!
More tutorials please!
Please do a countering video on an actual person who has droopy jowls & double chin
You have the most perfect nose kandeeeee 😍😍😍
Your nose is perfect.
When I do makeup it usually looks like I fell in a pool of mud.
I will try these tips and hope they work :) tyvm
Contouring to make it look like you have high cheek bones.
i love it but you should demonstrate on someone with a different nose cuz u already have the perfect nose
I’ve been made fun of my whole life for my upturned nose! Great tutorial kandee, I love how you really show how to do these things instead of just doing it and expecting an amateur like myself to know what the heck you’re talking about!
But Candy i think your natural nose is super cute. And yes the nose can bring you the most insecurities my nose is big but i think positive  and tell myself  it helps me to breathe better LOLZ
yesss i love these videos.
Your so talented with makeup
Yes! Great video!
Yay!   Live this!   Yes more on this please!!!!
I have both noses combined 😇 im always told i have a cute nose lol how odd
Hun you literally have theeee nose! Your nose is asked for all the time in plastic surgeons' offices. I know cuz I'm a medical student trainee, currently training at a plastic surgeon's office :) Sooo, keep your very perfect nose xoxo
Does it work on a bulbous nose?
Id love to see a nose contour tutorial  on someone who doesn't actually already have a great tiny nose lol
I saw you on The Real!!! Go Kandee!!! 💜
OMG.🙌🙌 That is the best nose contouring video I've ever seen. All the others are dark straight down each side and light down the center.

My biggest issue I have with my face is my lips. I have a fuller bottom lip so when I wear any shade of red or brighter colors I feel like I look like a clown, and I always feel like it is so obvious if I even barely overline my upper lip. Ugh!
I always try to contour my nose but it’s crooked lol but I am going to give this a shot!
I. Just. Heart. You!
Love your hair <3
Iam obsessedddd w your hair 😍😍😍
Can you do a makeup with noses that have a Bump?
Lmao this doesn't work for my nose shape
This video made me hate my nose :(
I have a celestial nose and button nose! idk how but mine is just a Lil bit wider!
I love your blue nails
Yes please more more 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Accentuate cheek bones
Eye shadows everyday and glam for hooded eyes. Down turned heavy hoods at mature woman age. Please
Zac Efron had a surgery ...
How can I hide my smile lines?
lol I love kandee but wtf is a snub nose like people did a great job naming what's considered a "cute nose"
Thank you 😊
how are you almost 40? you look so young!
Thanks kandee you help me feel pretty
I have bumped nose I can’t contour my nose from the side a bump is a bump 😫
We miss you so much. 😭
This...is a lot of work
You are so beautiful and I wish I had your nose!
Superman has a celestial nose and he's GORGEOUS
WhTs that in my eye?? It's the 4th of July! 💃💕
I have a snub button nose
Please do a video on lip lining ! My top lip is almost invisible and I hate it 😩 please help me!!
Your nose is already perfect, Kandee!
Oh hi kandy! Where have you been ?
What about hiding a lip scar?
Video starts at 3:16
But you did botox eyebrow..:-S
I missed you
What?! You have the cutest nose ever!
BEST looking sculpted face appropriate nose/nostrils are found most often on jock male faces.
I wanna see a look where you hide the double chin, and make your face appear less rounded. I love your videos and you’re such an awesome person! 💚💕
Your crazy, you have the cutest nose girl!
You are so talented
I really need to know how to define m chin without my neck looking dirty and how to upturn my downturned hooded eyes! I've hard and been made fun of for both my entire life!!!
I'm down for the makeup-surgery for correcting issues on the face! :)
Thank you Kandee for making this video, I have been searching and
watching SO many nose contouring videos in the past few weeks and 
none of them was perfection like this one! GREAT video!
Kandee I've always loved your nose! I've missed you! Kandee can you show how to fix one hooded eye. Like one eye that is hooded while the other isn't...setting them the same. Or also one eyebrow that is up higher than the other. xoxo Mary
Thanks for the tips! Much better than all those desiccated “snatched” noses. Lol.
I have a upturned nose and it not so great bc I’m always having to trim my nose hair. Sorry if tmi 🤣
I thought I was going crazy. I watched this video right away, then when I went to watch it again, it was no where to be found!  I was baffled. Then I saw your Snapchat. Whew. Found out I wasn’t as crazy as I thought I was. :).   Love your makeup in this video!
I have smile lines I need to hide not sure if there is contouring for that😩. Your crazy to to think that about your nose we can trade. I wish I had your nose. I hate my nose,  definitely gonna try this cute nose thank you.
Yesss!! ❤️❤️❤️
How 'bout changing your lip shape
Kandee I love u!! I’m always so inspired by u and learn so much!! Hope ur doing well and taking care of urself, u deserve the world ♥️💜
Yessssss lets do more of these videos!
Can you do a double chin contour. I currently have a fatty patch under that area and I'm not sure how to contour it. I'm not sure if I need to make my neck look longer with highlight or both.
I have a Celestial nose but I would like it to be a bit more narrow.
What if you have a long skinny nose that turns up at the end, no one ever has tutorials on them:) Also My face is too skinny, like i look sick and many tell me so.  I have tried so many things but have yet found a way to contour backwards of everyone. 
Also recently makeup does not stick to the end of my nose, even with primer and powder... WHY WHY help..;)
Kandee Your videos just bring me joy, thank you.  I love you on GlamMasters..
I am sitting here watching all your past videos & I love them all equally. I will ask one word of advice and that is how in the world can I keep my foundation from looking cakey? It seems no matter what foundation I use or how I do my makeup it may not look cakey when I finish but within a hour it is super cakey. 
Someone please help 😕😕⁉️⁉️
Your nose is beautiful
I would be so happy with your nose! I have a long chin. Could u show a video on how to make it look less protruding?
Loved the nose contour tutorial, I learnt something new that I've never seen before. Can you do a tutorial on how to make your lips look fuller using makeup?
Love you Kandee💕
I have a very long face, whenever I try to contour my face it just ends up looking longer. I some how can't give myself the illusion of high cheekbones either. Any help kandee? Love you!
Love the vibe you have 💜
I have OCD and I just noticed your eyebrows are so different not be mean but it just stands out to me does its stand out for any of you
Please do more plastic surgery with make up videos! I was contouring before it was even a thing because of your og plastic surgery with make up videos!!! #kandeefam
I was born with a button/snub/celestial nose & HATED it for so long!! My mom always said I'd grow into it lol! My gma was more beautiful than Liz Taylor & my mom got the nose, too... Now I am grateful for the nose & must put a lil contour on it for photos, or sometimes it looks like I don't even have a nose! Lol! Xo's Kandee!!
You are seriously the sweetest and most beautiful woman! I can never NOT smile while watching you! And your makeup abilities are incredible! You are always my “go to” on any makeup “how to!”  I loved this nose contouring video and would definitely be interested in more “non-surgery, plastic surgery “ videos! One possible idea: making a really prominent chin a little less prominent?
Is it just me or did it look like her nose was already contoured by her eyes? Just curious if I'm the only one who seen it
i love this and i love you!!
WTH her nose is already so cute lmao
Hi Kandee 😘. I hate my button nose, how do you make it look like you don’t have a button nose.
I call my nose a buzzer.  After Wakko from Animaniacs.  When the game show host on that episode rrrrrrrripped the buzzer off his podium, he used his nose.
Hey Kandee love your videos, how about getting rid of underlines under your eyes without getting surgery I think that's a tough one . Thanks!
Great video Kandee 😊 can you do a video on overall contouring and what the difference is between contouring and bronzing is and what colors to use if your doing both? I get confused between the two. I see so many people "contour" their cheek bones yet bronzing at the same time with that same shade. Or I'll see them bronze their cheek bones then go in and contour them but it looks like it's being done in the same spot.
OMGThat was scary! Do you know that you have almost 2,000,000 subscribers! On Instagram? (I’m sure you do congratulations lady!) I subscribed but I got a Tell ya’ it was a little scary! And it’s just really amazing ((((Kandee))))) Thanks for the hugs
Help!!! I "have" the what I think is a dreaded BUTTON NOSE and I hate it!!! I'm the only one out of 6 kids in my family born w/o a perfect nose👃😢!!! I want it to appear straighter!!! Yes, I do get compliments which makes me even more insecure and it shouldn't but it does! Love you Kandee and think you're super awesome and I highly respect you and all you do, muah💋💄😘⚘🌻👍🌻❤
Well what if you have huge nostrils like me... ☹️😭.. ugh I just wish my nostrils weren’t so huge . Because I could contour all day but it won’t change the features of how big my nostrils look ...
If I were to close my eyes I’d swear Gwen Stefani was talking... You two sound IDENTICAL! but of course you don’t look identical, you’re waaayy more gorgeous!
That's such a beautiful lip colour! Which shade is that?
Please do one on the jawline, for women that are starting to sag!
I love you kandee ! I have a pretty small nose but I feel like the tip of it doesn’t look as flattering as it could , any tips on what to do with that ? Xxx missed u
Contouring works like a charm if you live in 2-D Nintendo world.... as soon as I move my face around, it looks like a bulbous sausage link, with dirt marks down the sides. 😖FML
Love the pink background and pink hair!!! :))
wish my nose didnt itch all day :(
You have a cute nose! I like my nose. Ironically my mom had a nose job and then I ended up with that nose as well. Argument for plastic surgery changing DNA? I think so. 😂
Yay, a new video! Hi Kandee <3
I think u have a beautiful nose!
Your nose is beautiful!
What about faking cheek filler??
Kandee, I suffer from ptosis.  Do you know any makeup techniques for this?  I have asked this on a few channels but never get a reply. Thanks.
Oh my goodness! 😍 I tried this today Kandee and it worked beautifully. I’ve always had the toughest time contouring my nose. You taught this in a way that I was finally able to achieve the most perfect nose contour. Thank you ☺️ ❤️
Thank you for your content... all the kids are grounded from the electronics tonight which makes what I am watching VERY interesting 😄... we could all do celestial noses as a family
I have a combination o the celestial and button nose, I never really thought about my nose till now am I the only one who likes their nose🤣
How to contour a flat nose...tutorial pls
I love my nose. I think it's the cutest.
Im neeew and i not great contouring my nose, and i never actually saw someone with almost the exact same shape nose as mine, until today that i saw your video. And yes me too i always said that in one point i will fix my nose, but everyone started to said to me that my nose was cute and all that yaz, so i decide not to change it. Im glad i find your video!
You have some serious issues if you do not like your nose and feel like changing it... you'd be terribly unhappy if you had mine. Appreciate what you have
Love this!! More videos like this “plastic surgery” please .
Love kandees vids the best
CHIN!!!!! My chin is too long
This video is sooo helpful
It's really weird; front-facing my nose looks really cute, but once I turn my head it's like...when did she turn into a bird??
Your so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kandee!!! They finally restocked your sweet n sour! Gah! I bought like 3 of them!!!
love this video but can you please do one for contouring a larger more greek aristocratic like nose.... im one whos afraid of surgery and dont want to turn to it at all so if you can show how to contour larger nose shapes that would be great .... again absolutely love your videos wish you so many amazing blessings and thanks for reading😊
Great tips!! ☺️❤️
I aspire to be you.
You have the cutest nose I don’t know how you did not like it!! 😘😘😘💋💋💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️
Ur nose is a beauty
Your nose is already so cute. My nose is so wide lol
hell yeah
Hooded eyes!!! Jeje
So cute. Your nose is adorable without contouring😁😘
Do one on hiding a double chin!
umm u get a nose job? girl ur nose is my dream nose!!! love u u beauty
Can you share what work you have had done? Botox? laser? your skin is flawless!
I believe you really area professional makeup artist, because unlike most of the people who make these contouring videos, yours looks totally natural and I would never think it was makeup. Although I doubt you look much different without any on at all. Nose contouring looks so much more "real" without that dumb, trademark white spot on the end of a person's nose.
How about the hooded eye! How does one apply their make-up and not look 101 yrs old after their done. Oh on the hooded eye.Xoxo Tina faithful follower
THIS CHICK IS GORGEOUS.  THE LAST THING SHE NEEDS IS A NOSE JOB.  HER  BONE STRUCTURE   OF HER FACE  IS  NEARLY  PERFECT.  SO ARE HER TEETH, SHE''S HOT.
Kandee, you have the cutest nose ever! I used to hate my nose so much and when I was a little girl I would try to hold it down. I have an upturned,  high bridge nose. I finally became okay with my nose when I saw Sandra Bulluck. 😊 You are super adorable inside and out! 😘💕xo
Loved this video! I’d love for you to do my nose. It’s an interesting shape. Lol But I’ll give it a try tonight since I’m actually filming! Yay!
Everyone’s op ion on what is perfect is so different like I hate Elizabeth’s nose and I think your nose is perfect !!!
uhhhh maybe not to talk too fast, so your foreigners fans can understand you much easier !!!!!!!
Where are those earrings from?!!!
I never got the up/button nose thing, why do you want people to see up in your nose. Haha I always think people with up nose look like they are annoying people. I know I'm against the beauty norm in this case 🤣
Very Eurocentric but still an interesting vid
Step one: be born with a snatched nose
Is that sweet and sour?
NOSE PERSONALITY testing??? i think this is a joke but still no. this is too close to judging character/intelligence based on skull shape and other nonsense that has been really not fun for a lot of people.
I love youuu 💜
You have the Celestial Nose for sure
Your nose genuinely looked cute as a button when you finished (and even before you started!) 😂 i love the makeup plastic surgery idea!! love you Kandee!!
Hi Kandee, thank you I will try this out. Just wanted to say thank you for all your positive post I read on Facebook. Sometimes it seems that you know exactly how I’m feeling and you manage to turn my frown upside down! Seriously though, you have on many occasions made me feel that I’m not the only person going through painful stuff and that I am not alone. If I could reach out and give you a hug to say thank you I would. Just wanted you to know that you touch everyday people like me without even knowing it. Thank you Kandee, you are an Angel xxx
I needed this
I have really large pores on my nose so its super hard to contour on my nose :(
Did you said you eanted a nose job befote your father died ? 🐶 that was strange.
Lips!!! I have no Cupid’s bow. They are flaaaaat!
Oh I am so gonna do this!
I have a celestial nose
your face is so bright in this video it hurts my eyes and it's really hard to see :(
Your nose is perfect!
I was having the worst day ever because I got served papers. I’m being sued for a medical bill I can’t pay. I’ve been laying her crying not knowing how I’m going to pay the 916$ I owe and I knew right away I needed to watch kandee to help boost my mood ✨
I was born with a perfect nose. It looks like the one you are trying to construct with makeup. People call my nose a plastic surgeons dream. I'm blessed and grateful I have it.
I don’t understand why people like this. Perfectly straight is more attractive in my opinion, but to each their own.
Love you! I’m going to try it.
I don't care about nose contour tbh I just wanted to hang out with Kandee for a bit. :^)
Candy i have a butt chin i would like to see a vidio on how to contour it to hide the butt
Hi Kandee. I have my dad's nose. It's a high bridge but bulby tip. Can you show how to slim up the tip. Please, I'm desperate.
idea: How to counter super deep set eyes. It looks like you may need a model to make that tutorial, as you don't have that problem, but boy do I ever! Add to that dark circles and deep tear troughs.
Do U live in California like me?
is this technique works for an irregular nose ?
Yes more plastic surgery makeup please!!!!
Kandee, you make me smile all the time!
I would love to see you do a more Asian shaped eye.  I love their eye shapes, but I can't seem to be able to achieve that kind of look.  Also, I have the world's biggest forehead, and most tutorials just tell you to use some bronzer, but it only really works for people with just slightly bigger ones.  ❤️
Maybe I’m the only one who doesn’t see it but the before and after look exactly the same 😕
I'm stoned ans I just about died laughing when you talked about people contouring their nose to look like a beak thing and how youd like to look human
I have a celestial nose and my whole life I hated it because I was made fun of for it when I was younger and then one day a girl told me i had that shape and I started learning to love it♡
I love plastic surgery with make-up tfs and I'm sending a big hub right back - Love you Kandee!
You have a very nice nose :)
I have thin lips and have tried so many things to make them appear fuller. I watched an old tutorial video of yours on how to get fuller, plumper lips. But I noticed your lips now are definitely much fuller and plumper then they were back then and I really wanna know what your doing to get results like you have now. Please make a new tutorial. I wanna know your secret!!
More of Kandee please!!!!! 🍭💜🌈🍬💛💚🍭🧡💕🌈🍭💙💚💕😘
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO A JENNIFER LAWRENCE 2018 OSCAR'S makeup tutorial. I loved her look, she looked so sultry. PLEASE do, KANDEE!! <3
I LOVE YOU KANDEE!  God forbid you have to sneeze or wipe your nose! Bye bye pretty nose & hello muddy naked nose lol
I love this video! Could you please do a follow up where you have several people with very different shaped noses and do this contour on them? I have such a round nose that I can’t seem to get the knack of contouring it.
Can you demonstrate a contoured nose on someone with a flat nose?
LOVE YOU! I HAVE A CHANNEL AS WELL AND IT IS ABOUT BEAUTY FASHION AND MOVIES! I HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE IT! THANK YOU!
I have button nose and honestly I don’t like it.
❤️❤️
Ya but you have a cute nose to begin with. Show me a humongous nose. Then Ill be impressed
Whenever I do my contour I do not blend it well
Thank you
Oh god i have both of those nose types. Am i rare? Wtf lol i DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SOME KIND OF WANTED THING. honestly hated my nose
Help with hooded lids please!!
Just give me Jennifer Lawrence's nose and I'll never whine about my face again :)
Love you Kandee!
It's like the amount of make-up that clowns use, but for an entirely different reason. Some people like the "hyper-manicured" look. Others feel like it perpetuates an unrealistic ideal, or is a form of pursuing looks like found in things like anime.
This was so helpful like I’ve been doing it wrong
Wtf you talking about. Your nose us perfect. R u crazy
Can you do a video showing how you would contour the profile of a nose to make a small bump look less significant ?
I love your nose😍😘
my nose looks like this already ugh I wish I had kandee's nose w/o the contour!
Yes, yes, yes makeup plastic surgery.....
Love you kandee
You’re the best
I don't think I can benefit. How would Sara Jessica Parker contour her nose? That's where I am. But I wouldn't do surgery either because I look like my Dad too 💖💖💖😇😇😇💖💖💖
First 😘
How can I do a natural look and not look too feminine?
Starts at 3:40
First
You have a beautiful nose. I have a natural button nose but want your nose. We all want someone else's nose 😂  thank you!  Kandee!
I love your nose kandee!
Your nose is the cutest!! I'm gonna try this! Any pointers for contouring huge foreheads? :)
Can you do a video on how to get a straight nose?
I love these ideas
How do you make nostrils look smaller?
Hey, could you do a tutorial on how to make your lips look bigger?
Sure miss ur face
I think I have a button nose. I don't like it but a lot of people think its "cute".
Great video!! Love you kandee
Its funny that you dislike your nose. It's cute and small. I got a beak nose sooooooooooo :x
I have a natural snub nose and my whole childhood I was called pig nose and ramp nose and wanted plastic surgery to change it seeing its one of the most asked for shapes is so strange thank u for this x
I have a typical Italian nose and I love it! Yes it's a little big but that's one of the things I love most about, the other is its like Madonna nose and she has been my idol for 34 years! Though I will be experimenting with these techniques, even if it's just for fun! Love you Kandee, you're the best 💞💞💞💞
The part about your dad hit home with me. My dad died last month, & I even made a post about my features that people say I have of his. Some I had always disliked, but after he passed and realizing those features were like his-I love them about me now 💜
Kandee literally has the best nose. Total button nose.
I dont think those noses are the "perfect" noses. My preference is a straight nose, and maybe a slight hump. I  think it gives much more character. I love my nose shape, just wish it didnt stick out so much from my face, haha. With that i mean, just i bit smaller. @JuliaAndrsn instagram if anyone at all is curious, lol.
Can you please do a video on how to brighten the under eye area and look more rested? This momma of 2 toddlers needs some help.
Thank you!!!! Love u Kandee!!
Best nose contour video I’ve seen! 😍😍😍
I want a nose like yours kandee big noses run in my family i hate it !!!
Fabulous
I am sooo going to try this .,, it looks simple .,,, plz do more nose contouring for those that have bump on their nose to make it look straighter
I would like to know how to contour my type of nose I have a bump in the middle and also whole lot of cheek Help Kandee
I have a celestial nose 👌😊
❤️
Thank you for breaking it down in a way I can understand. Lol I’ve been doing it wrong, but now I know so I can get my nose looking cuter :)
Noeses are just weird lol
I have a little snub button nose, but there is a downside! We don't have much cartilage in our nose, the bridge is very small so big sunglasses are a pain as they always want to fall off. My optician tells me people with little noses like me should always wear glasses/sunglasses with the little pads that sit on the side of the nose. I of course never listen and always insist on big sunglasses and spend my days shoving them back up my nose! Your video does explain though why I've never found a video on how to contour a button nose!
Your nose is fine
I have a bulby nose and do the light button contouring but I bring it down a little lower so the “button” is smaller.
It’s up! I did have to search for it though. It wasn’t in my subscriptions. So excited for a new video though!
Who else thinks she has a really nice nose!?
Lol whoop that's all we are going to say about that! Thank you cause my 8 year old daughter was watching.
How about how to make your face look less long in the chin and forehead (I have a fivehead).
Kandee I just started watching GlamMasters - so excited to see you on there! You were the first beauty blogger I subscribed to 9 years ago. You inspired me to go to Makeup school and follow my passion to become a state certified MUA. Your positive attitude inspires me. I know you have dealt with hard times through out your life and it’s amazing you remain so positive! You are an amazing talented artist with beauty on the inside and outside!!!I love you Kandee! I would love to meet you someday!! I’m dealing with some terrible issues in my personal life - and I want to let you know you have inspired me to stay positive. I have a beautiful 3 year old boy and I have to be strong for him and teach him to be kind to the world even when others try to drag you down. I wanted to let you know you have been a true inspiration to me! Thank you!
cant wait to get my new celestial nose 👃
Hi Kandee, my name is Sophia Torrez. I am 16 years old, and I LOVE makeup. My dream is to become a professional makeup artist. You and Charis Lincoln ( aka Charisma Star) are my favorite YouTubers. Charisma Star is my idol and I love her so much. I Love You Too. Love Sophia. 😊😍
That’s weird it won’t let me   Turn on your notifications
Slimming jaw line
Very nice personality ...
Love your videos!!!

Excellent video!!!!
Please tell me how to make my jaw and neck look younger
💖
love you
What eyeshadow are you wearing? I love it
Kandee your nose is perfect before and after!
Love you Kandee Johnson!💖💖💖💖💖🌸🌸🌸🌸
I hate my nose because I broke it in middle school and ever since I have a huge bump on the main top of the bridge on my nose. I try to contour my nose but I can't figure out how to successfully hide the bump? I think that some plastic surgeons show old pics of drawings of Roman noses and Greek noses and mine looks just like all the drawings they show. Any help would be amazing! Because I can't afford a nose job. Help me Kandee
Welp turns out I already have a celestial nose
Anyone else have the issue where the brush removes your foundation when you contour ??
Contour to make a nose look shorter
I heard you say you've done this technique on many different nose shapes. I wonder if this works on a Thai/Asian nose. I've always wondered what to do to make my nose look more attractive  and less wide. 
So does this make me one of the 13% of the population. Aoparently i got celestial nose BUT all my life i hated it i actually love your nose Kandee 💗
???what problem is there with your nose??dont understand that! Its small-short -like M M `s nose-so what??
❤️❤️❤️
Love the in depth video!!. Don't find up turned noses attractive myself. I'm more of a classic straight lover, unfortunately my nose is wider than I like and as you said it ,bulbous on the tip. How can I make it look slimmer and straight?
Hi Kandee! I love uuu... I have really small eyes and big cheeks. Can you do a tutorial on how to make your eyes look bigger?
There is absolutely nothing wrong with your nose, it’s not big and it’s not too small.  It’s a perfect shape and size for your face.
I have a button nose that is Kinda upturned, its also a celestial nose, ive never really tgought about that until this video
Great video💖💖💖💖🔝
I have a bulbous nose & I hate It! I’m going to try this technique before going under the knife.
Kandee you are the cutest thing ever
Comment below what other "plastic surgery" with makeup videos you'd like to see below!!!!!
I have a request.  I'm in my late 50's and am starting to get jowls.  I hate them.  What, if anything can a person do with contouring to minimize their appearance. I have good skin otherwise, few wrinkles and good cheekbones.  I know most of your followers are young and lovely, and perhaps this request is not something most would need.  Loved the tips on nose contouring.  Thanks!
Why are you teaching women to have the "celestial button nose" instead of loving themselves. Your videos are so contradictory.
Forehead, how to make it smaller
You are so darn cute! I like your nose too lol. I can Never seem to get my contour right. Seriously I have tried different contours of All types, brushes that were recommended and Nothing works for my nose! I really hope this helps I want a cute skinny nose
Why would you want a nose job??? That's one of your cutest features
I have double chin problems besides being chubby it runs in family from my Fathers side awww
I have a bump on my nose bridge. how do you contour that type of nose?
Watching your channel will never get old...whether I’m watching a video for first time or tenth! Love you Kandee Cakes!!! Xo
I have the snub/upturned nose and I used to not have a problem with it until my family started saying it looks like a pig's snout. Now I'm more self conscious about my nose and try to contour/fix it with makeup.
Hey Kandee!! I have a unique request for the plastic surgery with make up! I have a long philtrum (vertical space between the end of my nose and beginning of top lip) I also have thin lips, I think it ages me and gives my face a masculine quality...can u please help!!????
Wow great results with just contouring!
I love my nose! It's cute and small!
What I wouldn't give to have that little "pig" nose that you say you have.
Ur nose looks so great. Like ur actual one
I want your 👃
Nice tips, but why do you put on like 10 layers of makeup for? I bet you look better without all that dough.

More  vids like this Please!!!!!!!!!
Yeah . love it
Unsubscribing,you got old looking,got to pick some different makeup youtubers
Your nose looks fine.
I don't mind my nose it fits my face  but I guess I have a "perfect" nose according to this video. But in some cases plastic surgery is needed because there is no make up trick or hack or product that can hide the bags under these eyes.
I lost about 200 +pounds i have a excess skin under my chin or you can call it my double chin. I had ot before losing the weight but it was fuller. Now it's just saggy. Could you please help.
is there a way to contour the sides of the nose? From the front I can make it look the way I want but if you look at me from the sides Its honkin! I got my nose from my dad as well and I love my dad but I'm pretty embarrassed by my nose from side angles and side profile pictures...
Hello ... my name is sama and I did change my eye colour by subliminal ... see my videos on my channel to see the result😍
Your nose is perfect and cute DOES NOT look like a alittle pig nose..not at all.
Great Video!:) More tip & tricks videos please.💗💙💗💙💗💙💗💙
When is your birthday, Kandee?
Your nose is already adorable
Kandee I love love love your makeup, tutorial please! XO'S
I like my nose
Kandee, you already have a perfect nose! So cute!!
I have that nose
Ok so anyone else trying to watch and it says "video will play after ad" but there is no ad?! 😒 I am just getting a black screen with no play button, no pause button with ad 0:00 n the bottom left corner and screen shot of the video in the bottom right. Annoying. It's only with this video. I tried to close out of YouTube then go back in then play it and it won't work. I can play other people's videos but not Kandee's.
Your nose is perfect! I used to love mine, until I got older. I'm not sure what happened, but it looks like someone hit it with the ugly stick.
Best nose contour video on YouTube
Wait...my nose is kinda like a bulbous nose... I get it from my mom . and already has a downward looking V shape that goes lower than my nostrils.. I don't even know if that makes sense...lol I feel like I can grab the tip like a little bulb, will this work for  this tip. Ugh. I really don't like my nose. And Kandee you already have the best nose!!
Can you please make another video on dealing with loss of parents? I recently lost both my parents at the age of 20 I’m having a hard time with wrapping my head around the fact. Please help me out with a new video on coping and living everyday after such loss.
The only thing I hate about my nose is the ridiculously large pores on it .
Does this work is you have a triangle nose, large and bulbous at the end? Think Roman with the bump in the middle! I've tried this and it looks so off. Is there something else I should try to make it smaller? Please and thank you!
I love my nose
I have... a bulb on my face
How about puffy eyes
What is this lipcolor???? :)
I have no idea what kind of nose I have.....hmmmmm
Can you do how to get rid of double chin with makeup?
I can't find any videos on how to make a hugely long nose look smaller. All the ones I see are how to make them thinner. I hate my nose and would get surgery tomorrow if there weren't so many scary botched stories out there! I also feel when I contour that I just look dirty when I'm done. I think all my shades are too dark.
Definitely trying this ..
This is going to save me i still want surgery but that’s something im doing for me
Hi Kandee, not sure if it is interesting to explore but what about the make up for uneven, not harmonious face? My dental harmony went totally wrong with braces and it accentuated the uneven face - well we all know the sides of the face are not identical. I have one side which look puffier than the other where I have less teeth (butchery of my dentist when teen). I would like to have a everyday tip, which does not seem obvious to people who look close at me, not to notice that imperfection. I think you know how people get focused on slight imperfections.
Kandee how do you do eye makeup for uneven eyelids? Please help!
Are you still using rapid white to keep your teeth so white??
Eres lola
But your nose already is cute, adorable and charming, Kandee!    And yes, to more of this 'plastic surgery with makeup' please!
Awesome tute;-)
Pls delete the word “perfect” it was womens rights days a few days ago and if you support women you shouldnt encourage them to think they are imperfect just bc of a nose
I’d love to see how you can make lips look fuller.
I actually love my nose.  But need to learn this to know how to contour my cousins nose lol.  She hates her nose
I can’t see why or how you would not love your nose.  The celestial nose , or button nose come on, really - I don’t want to see their throats.  I don’t want to see their snot.  Ridiculous.  95%of the people, who don’t do makeup, live with what they have.  Too funny.  Body dismororphia is real.  the same goes for the face and nose.  Kind of bizarre really.  Most people work 9-5 and never even search for makeup.  Love your show but wish you would teach people how to enhance their looks, not to look like someone else.
5th
Kandee don’t you have the snub nose? It’s cute and upturned.
I like my nose tho
Hello
My nose is shaped nothing like this, I am Greek and it's big🙊👃 LOL. So can you do another video showing how to make your nose look smaller and wider instead of long and skinny??? Pretty please!🙏😇
I’m an older subscriber and I’ve always had thin lips but now they’ve just about disappeared! Can you do a video on someone older that has very thin lips and show me a new trick with make up?? Please and thank you!
my nose is like this anyways I GEUSS my nose is p
What about a bump on the bridge of your nose? I have it. I hate it. To me it seems there is no way to contour it. I have wanted surgery for it since I was a kid!
Your nose isn't big to begin with i need help I have a honker!!!
PLEASE DO A CONTOUR NOSE.....LIKE HOW TO SLIM A WIDE NOSE, HOW TO MAKE A NOSE SYMMETRICAL IF NOSE IS CROOKED, ETC.
I have a "celestial nose" and I HATE it!! Can you PLEASE do a video on how to make it look not so thin and upturned? It looks like Cindy Lou Who!
Cheeks plz
Nice video!
Kandee already has a small nose though
Love
I love you so much 💖💖💖
I say it in the first upload, your nose is perfect and your face is a piece of art! Maybe Youtube hate you, but my little self loves you!!! Love ya!
+kandeejohnson  Fab tutorial on nose shading and highlighting!  +LilyJarlssonhome should view this - an accurate reference for the "optiſch kleinere Naſe" referred to in one of her older vids.  ("Optiſch ſchmalere Naſe" looks too loan-word for either deutſch or deitſch. )
Did you had fillers on your lips or is it makeup
Hahahaha I have a piggy nose too
Great video !
I would like to see a video on making your forehead look less wide/smaller or not so far back
what brush did she use???
Please help! I have a very round face and baby chubby cheeks when I smile. I keep struggling with how to contour and highlight my extremely pale rounded baby face. I've also discovered that the only blush that looks human on me is something like a cartoon Snow White. Very red, which my cheeks already are. Please just help me out, I'm not getting any younger or less single. LOL
hiiii
New stubby. I'm 60, need help with droopy eyelids, and sparse eyebrows.  I look good in mauves and Brown's on eyeshadow.  Have green/hazel eyes.  What do you suggest? You are so beautiful.  Ty for the info♡♡♡
I Love you
Love this! 💕
Funny!
Thank you for doing this!i Suk at contouring my nose #ImaItalian #bignose..gonna do this..,my husband says thank you I'm saying him Cha Ching lol.:I don't get why people put highlight down the middle of the nose if your trying to make it look slender 🤔😩🙃😂
You have such beautiful eyes Kandee! Thanks for this tutorial gonna use this technique to give myself a temporary day nosejob on days when I feel I need it most, I have days when my nose is an insecurity. Haha so this is good. Love ya. 😘☺
I hate shimmer.....I hate that most make-up now is shimmer-y
She says she's scared of plastic surgery but she sure isn't scared of lip injections!😨
Lift the eyes with makeup please
Here's the link to the challenge video on Molly's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhfG3a6rnyY
Who else is frustrated that molly keeps getting interrupted?
Why must Kandee constantly interrupt Molly? Molly is too sweet to tell her to chill out and be respectful.
Is this a blind vs deaf because it seems like kandee can't hear molly talking as she interrupts molly constantly😕😕
'Im not gonna talk while doing my lipstick because I will mess it up' 
talks while putting the lipstick on
She was so rude. Let her talk. I wanted to hear what she said and you could see how annoyed she was when she screamed over her and acted like nothing she said was important. So self absorbed. She deserves an apology. Fr.
Girl if you don’t stop interrupting Molly
10% of this video is about Loving Molly 
90% of this video is about Kandee not letting molly talk 🤫
I agree with all 100%
You’re so rude it’s not all about you actually let her speak and finish her sentences
Kandee not trying to be mean but it is very disrespectful to interrupt people when they are talking maybe you should work on being respectful
Let her speak please
Can Kandee let her talk for a whole sentence without interrupting
Thank you, Molly, for explaining how people with disabilities adapt and create their normal!! It’s not “oh poor you...” blah blah blah. It’s just normal ☺️
I have seen Molly everywhere lately and I love her!!! So glad you did a video with her!!!!!!
I might have subscribed but the orange girl was being so rude always talking over the blind one.
For people in the comments NO ONE WHIT A DISABILITY NEEDS TO PROVE IT TO YOU!
Kandee, let her finish talking :(
i also have Retinitis Pigmentosa. this was truly inspiring considering i am at risk of becoming blind. makeup is something i love and this shows that no matter what, i can overcome my disease to do what i love.
Love Molly but Kandee really needs to stop talking over her. Btw all of you who are like 'if molly is blind how does she know where her product is' i'm pretty sure she was the one who put it there so...
Both their voices sound cartoonishly high pitched, fry-y, and mouse like... Wtf. Kandee doesn't normally sound like this.
My friend had just got back from LA, and when I went to go pick her up, this old guy said "You're blind right? Does it hurt if you poke your eye?" so I walked past him saying "You can breathe right? Does it hurt when you can't?"
Kandee...
1. Let Molly talk.
2. Oompa Loompa much?
My mum is blind and everyday she has to do makeup, cleaning, cooking with her blurry vision. I feel so grateful for her and everything she has done for even if it is all she had.Xx
Omg I can’t even tell she’s blind! Amazing!!
people are being kind of mean. Kandee was speaking over Molly but instead of ridiculing her maybe we should just say "hey you kind of cut Molly off a lot of times" so that she can work on it, we all know she wasn't doing it to be rude.
Kandee, I adore you, and loved this video, but oh my god I could hardly hear what Molly was saying half the time.
Molly was asking what type of lipstick Kandee was using if it was liquid or stick while looking right at her and I was like your looking right at her but then I realized 🤭😧 I’m a idiot
Did anyone else notice that when Molly was talking kandee kept saying "yeah yeah" or she started laughing
A little uncomfortable to watch because of you interrupting her... like relax a bit
You both are super inspiring, especially you Molly!
Kandee kept interrupting her. 
I wanted to hear what she had to say.
Did anyone notice that molly is left handed
When kandee was doing her brows she wouldn’t let Molly talk!! And when she said she’s gonna do liquid eyeliner she wouldn’t stop interrupting her
The sighted girl did her lips better. The blind girl did the eyes better. But for some reason both put more make up on their left eyebrow that the right. XD
This is a really cool video. I have not ever seen a visually impaired person put on make-up. I'm just amazed!! #INSPIRING
Omg Kandee, why are you interrupting her so much?!
I love this video! You guys are both amazing! Glad I found two more channels to subscribe to :)
In the beginning I was like; Where is the blind person? 

You both look so bootifuuul <3
You both are so incredible! Subscribing to Molly, she's amazing!!! xx
Molly is so strong my mums brother is blind and he has worked so hard and currently he got picked from his company to go and work in NYC for a month sky is the limit lyl xxx
“Kandee Johnson cutting off Molly Burke for 16 minutes straight”
Molly seriously is a really pretty girl without makeup on too
Could you let her finish at least one sentence? It was so frustrating.
Why is Kandee so orange...
For a blind person, she seems to have a big enough heart to see the goodness in everyone ❤️ You both are wonderful! Love you all!
Girl stop interrupting molly
“Do sighted girls do that.”       Sighted girls I’m using that next time I get my glasses broken. (Not the same thing as being blind but I can not see clearly more then 3ft away from me. P.E. Was a nightmare when my glasses broke.)
SHE KEPT CUTTING MOLLY OFF 

JUST LET JER TALK 🙄
I did a report on her she is amazing!!💜💚💙💛 and i love  her and ive seen all of those photos you put on here!! Love ya lots!!💜💚💙💛
U know I always want to know what it feels like to be blind🤔🤔and Molly did a awesome job even tho she’s blind ,i am wow !!!!!
So for all the comments saying Kandee talked over her the whole time. She didn't. The only section where I truly noticed it was the eyebrows. That's it. The while 7 minutes start of the video Molly talked pretty much 90% of the time about how her condition and how she feels for the make up etc... this is a video of two people who are both trying to explain what they're doing and how they feel doing this. For Kandee, like Molly said, it's a whole difference experience, so yes she's gonna feel overwhelmed and express that by talking. But I honestly can't see where she completely cut her off of spoke over her in a rude way during the entire video. 

If anything in most sections she only spoke above her to agree with her like how we do in normal conversation.
MOLLY IS EVERYWHERE
you cut off Molly every time she started talking
RANDOM QUESTION! Do you like dogs or cats better?
molly did so so good
Molly did great! She has adapted so well and I'm still her practising makeup on a doll since i was 13 years old
Molly's makeup looks better than mine.
Molly is a beautiful person!
Oh ma gosh! I just found molly on of shane dawson's channel💞
The Real Techniques sponges are just as good as beauty blenders, and are about $4-$5 for two
Let Molly talk for herself sheesh.
molly is so inspiring!! 


(i feel like molly won hahahXD)
"SIX MINUTES RIGHT WHEN WERE TALKING ABOUT DEPRESSION" 😂
she is not blind!!! She was not feeling around for what she needed! She literally is not blind.... Don't care what you all say
Wow she's amazing 🖤
I feel like she was cutting her off while she was giving her tips :(
Qu:How can she see the middle of the camera?

Your so beautiful by the way, love it make up!
Oh my gosh stop interrupting Molly this makes me so 😠
OMG your voice is exactly like Gwen Stefani's!!!! I LOVE IT!
This was so much fun, thanks for collabing! XOXO Sharon
Man Kandee keeps interrupting her... Listen!
oh my goodness!! I love her personality so much♡
She’s on everyone’s channels now
My
Molly is better at makeup then me 
And I’m sighted with a mirror
Ok I'm sighted and I can't do my makeup as good as her's😍
Omg SHES so beautiful 😍,but you can’t even tell she’s blind!
Molly is my qween
"I feel like everything I've done is a mistake" me too Kandee me too
Love this video so beautiful!! Love you two
It annoyed me that you kept asking her questions and then kept cutting her off.
Kandee is the new Manny Mua 

Jefree Star: pigmented
Manny: SO Pigmented

Molly: blend it out-
Kandee: BLEND IT OUT
I don't think the talking over her thing is as bad as everyone makes it seem... Women get excited during conversation  and talk over each other! I notice I do it sometimes and so do my friends. We're just excited that's all hehe
Honestly I love how molly did her eye makeup!!!! Did waaaay better than me 😂😂
Omg I love her so much she's so sweet and beautiful I cant :')))
I swear Kandee doesn’t let Molly talk without getting interrupted 😂😂😂
How perfect she is even she's blind😍😍😍😍
 You are gorgeous to have that beautiful pink hair 💕💕💕
"What happened to Kandee?" Molly has a good sense of humour. <3
When in doubt blend it out
This was such an uplifting video ❤️
I wish Kandee would of not kept cutting Molly off...
K : interrupts molly
2 secs later
M : So like ---
K interrupts molly again

M : The worst is --
K 
M : Annyyyways, so this--
K  : 
M : So i felt so --

K : 
I don't feel like kandee was interrupting her at all. I feel like they're close friends and were excited and vibing off each other.
Mollys better at doing makeup then me XD
OMG I met Molly at a We Day in 2010! She is my absolute idol!!!!
I at was at the leadership and learning conference last year and you were my favorite speaker
Kandee keeps inturupting molly lol kandee let molly finish talkingggg
Aw I love Molly glad to see her callabing with such a big YouTuber. ❤️❤️❤️
Are the voices edited in this? 
Molly's voice isn't that high...

Why do you do this?
Ok so they look Better like me doing my Makeup and I have 100% Eye Vision AND a Mirror 😂
How would she know what video she's watching
Okay does anyone feel like Molly’s voice was higher then normal. Like it’s faint but definitely higher! Hmmmm conspiracy!!!
You two are sooooo sooo sweet!! This is the best collab I have seen in a long time!! You both have absolutely beautiful souls!! love you both to bits
New subbie, love the two of you!! Amazing spirits! Subscribing to Molly as well!
Stopp cutiing her offf omggg😑😑
girl, could you just let her talk?
You are so positive about yourself!
her voice is deafening
1:30 thank you for this <3
What a sweet and inspiring young lady. True beauty both inside and out.
Please stop talking over Molly, what she’s saying is actually helpful to blind people and no one can hear her
Both looked really good!
Aww poor Molly. Kandee wouldn’t even let her speak. Whenever she tried to talk kandee interrupted her.
She's so positive 🤗😍❤️
First video. SUBSCRIBED.
"how did you start watching youtube" I CRINGED
Molly so nice and humbled
This was my first Kandee video and.... I really liked Molly but it's annoying to see how much she's being talked over. It's like Jacklyn Hill and Kim K all over again..... 🙁
Molly is blind and still does makeup better than me lol but seriously she is so AMAZING 😍
OMG so cool❤️

woh so cool lol soz I repeated because I'm surprised that she never did mack up with a mirror that's soo cool
Her story is so inspiring. Feels fashion and makeup from within like that’s beautiful. ✨
I hate how much Molly is being talked over...
You both ended up looking gorgeous!!
Molly sounds like Abigail Breslin😂
I don't think Molly's blind I wish she was not 😭😭😭 but j love you both lots!!!
Love how Molly just stopped trying to talk lmao, she just gave up and stopped for a bit.
Most annoying part of the video: 8:03 - 8:36 so rude. 

"Molly: like I said"
I just clicked on this and Molly's voice is DEFINITELY higher than her other videos I've seen.
Wait how did she know where everythong was and what it was if shes blind ??? Im so confused?
I love how molly explains everything <3
in the description it says she is "completely blind" which is not true. She has light and shadow perception.
She kept interrupting molly
I know everyone else noticed but daaaaaamn let the girl talk. I could tell she noticed too.
OMG she is great at doing makeup
All these comments complaining about Kandee interrupting need to chill. Such an overreaction. For the most part, she was saying things like 'yeah' while Molly was talking, which to me is just her letting Molly know she's listening since Molly can't see that Kandee is looking at her and actually listening. Also, not to sound mean or anything, but Molly talked A LOT and Kandee never really had a chance to say her piece, so she kind of had to find a spot to get a word in and it didn't always work out perfectly because Molly would keep saying more, but it wasn't even that bad still. On a more positive note, both of them seem super sweet and are adorable.
How could you dislike this?🤪
Good video  👍👍

Would you have a good look on our video and let me know what you think as In my opinion you could have an eye for this
It makes me sad how much Kandee interrupted Molly in this video. Not a good first impression
One question for molly:
What do you see, is it like, white, or something? Or just indescribable?
ya for people who think molly is faking it, just watch this. Sometimes while going for the pallet she missed and just the way she moves her hands and the way she does things, you can tell
Molly is looking beautiful and a pretty doll
Molly definitely won.
You were a stunningly gorgeous 14 year old. Still gorgeous now obviously. ❤️❤️
Idk why you interrupted so much. :/
She´s such a sweetheart ❤️
Molly with red lipstick and the hair looks SO PRETTY
stop interrupting Molly
Oompa loompa girl!!! You orange!
not hating on kandee but i just felt she was a bit rude, like you was just constantly talking over molly.
Molly i am so glad you are so happy😇😇
This was so fun! Thanks for collabing, Kandee! <3 xo
LOVE LOVE LOVE this!
I LOVE EcoTools.. those and elf are the only brushes i use!!
Literally anyone named molly is an amazing person.
I wish this video wasn't a time challenge. Molly has a lot of inspiring things to say and because of the time crunch they both rushed through their thoughts and it resulted in kandee speaking over her.
She is so cute. I have poked my eyes so many times... "do sighted girls do that?!" LOL
"Kandee said how did u get into watching... she blind." Said my cousin
Love the concept of this video. I can’t help but feel sorry for Molly though. Kandee asked a question about if Molly fills in her brows and every single time she tried to answer she talked over her?? Super rude imo 😬
Pink hair lady stop talking over molly
STOP TALKING OVER MOLLY OML
You guys are being obnoxious! Kandee did not cut Molly off that often. Molly got to speak so much!! They are trying to beat a clock and are excited! Stop being rude!! I felt the complete opposite that Molly talked more! I loved them both.💕
cough cough the new Sebastian bails
Molly is so inspirational!  😍
I love how Molly Burke is become huge and i actually love it and her oml❤️
you always look on the bright side molly, keep it up!!!
Wow!!! Molly is beautiful!!! And amazing!!!!! Much love! Kandee you did a great job too!!!!  Love! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dude, quit interrupting Molly, it’s not all about you.🙄 Jesus
Has she got no basic manners?...Interrupting your guest every 5 sec is like come on
I love you Kandee, but stop talking over people.
they both look so beautiful without makeup and they are so sweet!!
im sorry but it was really annoying how kandee just yellin over the time.. i really wanted to here molly talk. but o well. kinda rude of kandee forreal..
At the intro, i honestly got confused on who is the blind
Wow the two seconds that Kandee wasn't talking while doing her lipstick was the most heavenly thing I've ever heard
Molly looked so good, I didn't believe she was blind.
Molly is absolutely gorgeous😍❤️
Kandee's voice sounds like Vanellope from Wreck it Ralph to me 😂😂😂
Molly is the true superwoman!!  love her!!
Is Molly FULLY blind, or only PARTLY?
Kandee talked over this girl so much that I wasn’t able to enjoy this video
when my face looks too caked, I just blend it all together with a big brush and pray.
Why is this video extra high pitched?

EDIT: Oh I see, it was sped up. Despite the reverb, sounds better in a slower playback.
Molly is better at makeup and she is blind! Bless her.
Molly looks so different now lol. Anyone in 2019
Molly looks beautiful
gosh if you didn't know she was blind you wouldn't be able to tell !! so inspiring xx
This was awesome and I'm not even into makeup! Assumptions- smashed!
Your liner was good until you put the dark eyeshadow on top of it
this was nice 💙
At first I couldn’t tell who was blind shows what rlly matters in life 😂❤️❤️
Molly is better at makeup than me and I'm not blind😂😂
I love that molly uses her bronzer as an eyeshadow, I do the same thing 😊
No way I could do it without a mirror though!!!  Wow you guys look great!
This video was adorable, and y'all are both beautiful people!
kandee   omg!!!!!let her  finish!
She’s amazing!
She’s changed so much this past year!
damn kandee interrupting her 24/7
how is Molly finding all the make-up without feeling, or looking at it?! 0_0
nak apply eyeshadow pun tgk pallete.  kau tu buta kut. tgk bukan nmpk.
Am i the only Person who's is thinking about how Molly knows wher the products are and how does she know what colour it is?😂  like it's crazy amazing !
justice specialize huge concentrate those salt parental chain stress background bounce.
Molly is so amazing... I can’t imagine moving your eyes when you talk but not seeing the other persons face. If I was in that situation, knowing me, I wouldn’t be able to function in life anymore. Truly spectacular x
While Molly was explaining her stuff in the beginning, the whole thing reminded me of when Tyler the creator was making waffles with that iconic ”uhhhh, I’m not finished” scene
Molly is amazing!! 💗
While the overall video was rather stressful, with the shouting etc. i dont think Kandee was THAT bad. The comments are so exaggerated. By all means, Kandee wasnt the best but Molly talks a lot & they seemed to be both fighting for the spotlight.
Loved the concept & both people but overall not my favourite video, very stressful indeed.
Molly is so interesting! Kandee should have held back with talking over her and yelling so much! It drove me crazy!
Quit judging peeps everyone chats with everyone different, they were in a rush and you can tell they're a bit nervous. I'm sure she didn't mean to cut her off, lol.. you can tell Kandee just gets excited! Anyways this video was so beautiful, thank you for sharing :)
Kandee's voice reminds me of Max from 'two broke girls' and I love her 💙
Yaaaaaaas I love this girl! Reppin the disabled community
This is acc how I found Molly, no through Shane 😮
I'm learning about disabilities in my reading class. (In a good way) you go Molly!! You are so brave!!
MOLLY!!! ♥️♥️♥️
Omg everything is her best friend, (molly)
Molly began speaking faster so she can get to finish a full sentence 😂😂
molly is speaking really fast so she doesn’t get interrupted
Molly , U are a beautiful young lady with positive thoughts
Molly is blind but beautiful
How is Molly blinded and can watch YouTube
I would be so terrified of doing mascara if I was blind. I can't even do it properly with good eyesight.
Molly is such an inspiring girl, she is so happy 😄lysm too Kandee❤
Um ok this was nice and all but she kept interrupting Molly XD I wanted to hear what she had to say
Molly is totally blind, you can tell by the way she feels for stuff
Watching Molly do her makeup is a beautiful thing. It's all about what she feels looks good. Not seeing it would scare me honestly. She's amazing! 💗
Kandee where on earth did you get that shirt😍😍 I need to know asap
These girls are so amazing especially Molly thank you for being such positive role models!
You're both such gorgeous gorgeous humble beautiful people <3
So... you are absolutely completely blind? How can you pick up and use everything so easily??? I’m always dropping everything XD
This brings back soooo many great memories! I had a suit-mate in college that was blind since the age of 5, and I taught her how to do her makeup. We would print out Braille labels so she would know what product she had and what color. After a few times practicing she was able to put makeup on better then any person who still had their sight. This video has me on a mission to reconnect with my friend Lisa, thank you for such an inspirational video.
Kandeeypu rocked that out girl and your friend there is such a beauty inside and out. Such a sweetheart
I did a teen activism project on Molly Burke for school because she is a bullying activist
Molly is so beautiful she doesn’t need makeup, but I know she likes it and that’s amazing ❤️
Lol she keeps talking over Molly 😂🙄🙄
Such a fun video & very interesting! I just really wish Molly had more chances to finish her sentences/stories. She was the highlight of this video but I think we could have learned more if she had more time to talk.
She sounds like that one girl from wreck-it Ralph 
Is it her?
if I was Molly I would had kept quite...just quite the whole video, due to anger from being interrupted all the time.
Lmao I wonder how she knows if she looks good,and if she asks  someone would if they were playing and joked💀
Damn… I don’t even have that much style with sight 😱😂
i wrote about molly burke in my informational book for school :) it’s about preventing bullying
Its easier to be deaf and do makeup (like me) but there is a lot of good things when your blind or deaf. Im Deaf and i wear hearing aids and i know asl and i know a blind girl too! And her make up is great! She is only 13 and im only 11!! Deaf, blind, or hearing impaired ppl have a super power. When u are blind or deaf you have too work around some stuff and then that becomes a daily routine. So our super power is what ever we work around!! So its amazing to see a disabled person!! As long as your friendly!
u keep interupting her and its really rude
And she is so confident about telling her story aww x
My hair is exactly like yours
The blind girl is so amazing and talented.
Jesus, let Molly talk. Oh God, this is giving me major Jacklyn and Kim K vibes. 😂
This video is great although Kandee kept interrupting & talking over Molly. Smh
9:44 She FINALLY finished her sentence, just like
 "Yeah, my turn now."
She kept cutting Molly off like..I was so happy in those 5 seconds when she said she wasnt gonna talk so she could do her lips.
Tbh the only thing that annoyed me was that she was constantly was reminding us. Like... we know you're blind it's not like we are going to forget withing the 16 minutes of this video...
“If in doubt , blend it out”😎
How can she know where to look.  She can look at the cam straight and to the person he's talking.  Wow. Amazing.
HOW AMAZING IS MOLLY YOU GUYS!!!!!!!?????!!!!!
Both beautiful but the blind one inspires me
My name is Molly too! In glad some one is famous with the name Molly! Fun fact about the name Molly : Molly is a drug
Molly's makeup looks better than mine XD and she is blind and had a time limit!!! I'm only partially deaf and have no time limit!!!
I really love both of their personalities and voices! I randomly found this channels just by wiggling around youtube.
Y'all need to stop hating and be positive 😜😜😊😊😊😀😀😀😀😀😁😁😁😁😁😁
"Beauty should be felt in a dark room" thank you for reminding me of this Kandee. Love Molly & of course you!!❤️❤️❤️
If she’s blind how does she ‘watch’ YouTube????? lol 😂
At 12:10 when Kandee just straight out stares at the camera for a good 5-10 seconds :`D COMEDY GOLD
Is Molly 100 % blind d or can see a little?
8:06 damn let her speak! U literally asked her a question and then talked over herrrr tf
That girl on the left looks like Perrie from little mix
Her voice sounds like venelope von Schweetz from  wreck it Ralph 😍😍😍
8:06 IF YOU ASK SOMEONE A QUESTION LET THEM ANSWER DONT CUT THEM OFF
Aw, I found her out from Shane! ☺️
I swear she's looking into a mirror 🙃
8:02 OMG SHUT UP THE BLIND GIRL IS TRYING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
She is so positive 👸
I was diagnosed with glaucoma at 16, I'm now 35 and am visually impaired. I looked up "blind makeup" because I'm now struggling to do my makeup with most of my vision gone in my left eye. I wish more people would do something like this ❤
Omg is she lefthanded I'm lefthanded too💗💗💗
Molly is so inspiring!! wow
Ok, I'm speechless.
molly is so pretty
Molly did better than I do on a regular basis
Aww Molly is so sweet 😊😊❤️
Sheesh can u interrupt her much 😂😂😂
Half way through every sentence Molly spoken kande started talking and the look on Molly’s face was she was sos so angry xx
Molly is actually rlly pretty without makeup too.
Every single comment is about Kandee interrupting molly xD
Contour is too dark... like your tan... makes you look like an orange
both of u guys kept talking over each other and like it made me sooooooooooo uncomfortable omg
Disability representation is important ❤️
You two are the cutest!!❤️
I think both girls were beautiful but the girl on the left was awesome
when in doubt, blend it out
you honestly dont need contour kandeeee rad 🎥  tho
Why is Kandee orange🤨
They are both so preety ❤️👌
You should do makeup in the dark that would be more similar to how she does her makeup 💗
Omaha your pretty
lol molly still finds time to have an ice calm conversation even under a 10 min timer
Love Molly!!!!!
Wow retinitis pigmotosa is so rare..my dad had it and in our family the women are carriers and only men get it and they usually dont go totally blind till their 50s. Im so glad to see more talked about this rare eye disease♡
Yessss!!! Molly is so brave!!! You go girl!! Slay allllll day!!!
kandee kept interrupting her every time she would talk and it was making me mad. like let the girl talk
why is she more orange than donald trump?
also why is she talking over her so much
Lol I can't do makeup in 10 minutes and all I do is mascara and eye shadow. It takes me 20 minutes.
I think this is being offensive but I don’t mean it y can Molly do better makeup then me like slay girl ur actual queen😍😍😍😍👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
She is so incredibly inspirational!!! I am just now realizing my life isn’t as bad as I think... it could be so much worse.
I saw sighted/ blind girl makeup and I knew it was Molly right away also her hair gave it away
Molly is such a sweet heart awww 😭💞
The time was all wrong😀🕑
I Bleeping love you guys.
Is this the girl off wreck it Ralph?
Molly you look great!!❤❤❤❤
Is kandee orange or is my phone broken?
Mollies makeup woahhh 😍
Did it get more blurry as you grow molly
You are very beautiful
Kandee asked her if she fills in her eyebrows, and she tried answering 3x and 3x Kandee cut her off... why even ask in the first place?
It’s almost as if every time Molly expressed a struggle, Kandee almost invalidated it by saying she had the same problem. Dude stop.
Yall! I WANT YALL TO KNOW THAT YOU DON'T NEED FROSTING TO BE BEAUTIFUL
you guys are beautiful either way :D
You go girl😘👍🏻
This was so interesting to me! I wonder how blind , or rather how much/little can Molly see.... or is everything just pitch black? 
And Kandee I think is genuinely interested and wants to make Molly feel welcomed and loved on her channel. She is at 💯 doing this challenge so her adrenaline is going!
This is the coolest makeup video i’ve seen in months. Not only an awesome challenge- but educational as well. Love hearing her perspective.
Mandeel kept cutting off Molly when she talks I hate it so much
Wait but her eyes are open...

Wow both of you did really good you are both very beautiful girls it should be a tie😘👍🏼
Molly, you are so inspiring! You go girl!😁
This makes me mad can you stop interrupting her she is genuinely trying to talk about stuff even answering you and you keep cutting her off 🙄🙄dislike
I feel like Kandee keeps interrupting Molly
Omg why do u keep interrupting her!
At 3:10 the chalange starts
Molly's personality is soo great.your very inspirational
Let molly talk
I noticed her eyes like, rapidly move which I thinks pretty interesting
Molly is so inspiring because she shows that no matter if you have a disability you can still do great things and have fun <3
Its amazing how shes blind and she can enjoy her life.
How can she “watch” YouTube if she’s blind
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this video! 💗
i love this video so much
Hahahaha 9:43 molly literal has to shout over her 😂
God bless both of you. You both are beautiful in both ways😊. You both are such an inspiration to people with disabilities. My siblings have autism and they are not blind, but I hope that they can learn to live with their condition, as you live with yours. Thank you for giving me hope, and I hope one day they can be like you, in the sense that they are positive about life.
holy shit, molly knows what shes doing!
Kandee stop talking over the other girl //: its really rude
You kept doing it
I don't think a blind person really needs a mirror to apply makeup in the first place... but okay...
the person that is counting down sounds just like Shawn Mendes
MOLLY IS SOO PRETTY I ALREADY LOVE HER
Kandee cutting Molly of made me so mad
I'm legally blind. 😎
This is so cute
molly is so talinted and I love you kandee and molly to.
I love this challenge
I love Molly so much and I think nobody needs makeup to be butifull
There’s a mirror in one of the pallets 😂
You were on skin wars
Girlll let her talkkkkk
Molly did her makeup better than I do with a mirror lol
Iam not hating but she look butifull she doesnot look blind🤗
I can't even do my makeup and I can see. She's so stunning and inspiring.
Stop cutting of molly
She not letting Molly talk. I would of gotten so piss!
She dose not look blind bc her eyes are moving like she can see something😩
Kandee: I’m not gonna talk while I put my lipstick on 
Also kandee: continues to talk at full speed while putting her lipstick on
She kept talking over molly my god
Wait is she completely blind? She’s reaching for the products and picking them up perfectly without knocking anything over?
Let her finish her sentence kandee, you were so rude towards her, it ruined the video so much. and it made me loose some of my respect towards you.
Molly looks like blair waldoff with the hair and makeup
IVE MET MOLLY!!!
#Blenditout
You guys are amazing. Your both very pretty too.
If anyone thought Molly would finally get a word in once kandee had to do her lipstick, you were sadly mistaken 😂
"Do sighted girls do that?!" Lol so cute
This is the first video I've seen and I thought Kandee was the blind one
"I started watching makeup tutorials" 😑 how?? And how is she turning and looking at kandee? I'm so confused
8:52 "I feel like everything ive done is a mistake" hahahahah my life
U r both so pretty! Love ur channel and I wish I was as pretty as u even though I try not to hide all of my natural beauty with makeup!
3.08 is when the video starts
This is very inspiring to me and now I will really take sight into thought.
I hated at 8:03 when Kandee kept cutting Molly off.
I have a question
Do blind people see their dreams
Omg molly your 23 honestly you look so young I love u so much molly and your such a inspiration to me
I kept forgetting she was blind..
She is not blind she is beautiful
I mean how can she look at u
Notice she says “watch” she also knows where shtuff is 

Sorry I had to point it out :p
when you asked her about doing her eyebrows you didn't even give her a chance to answer without interrupting several times
She is  blind but she is beautiful 💖
if I was Molly I'd slap her
aw molly is so cute i’m gonna cry
I had no idea she was blind until you said! I’m blind in one eye because of scar tissue on my retina.
Molly is the sweest most kind hearted person ever. 💓
I think you can replace the retina? Or just the cornea and lens?
She is AMAZING! To me, being blind is such a huge fear for me. I'm sure it was to her at the stage in her life going blind. I can't even imagine. She's a true inspiration to me
better than me WITH a mirror #suck@makeup
No joke, Molly is so good at makeup!!!! I wish I could do makeup as good as her!!
Damn. She is so inspiring 😍
are really blind because you say "watching"
okay, why is this sped up? that is totally not Molly's voice, if you change it to .75 speed it sounds normal
Molly, my brother has this eye disease and I'm just happy you brought some awareness.
Omg the constant interrupting is really annoying 😱😱let her talk
I loved Molly but Kandee you need to stop enterupting her like she wasn't interupting you so pay the same respect.
Why is she ORANGE!!!
is this video like really sped up or something? why's everyone's voice so high...
Mollyg keped being inturupted !!!
Not to be rude But you kind of sound like Penelope Von sweets from Wreck-It Ralph
God Bless You!!!!!!!!!!!
What hat are you wearing, I’ve been looking for one like that forever.
I think I saw Molly on a dove commercial!!
I just recently had an eye appointment & they told me I have hole in my retna and if fluid gets behind it I could go blind. Its terrifying for me to think I could go blind. I have such bad floaters in my eye so its already as if I have glares & things in the way of my vision, but its nice to see a woman who is enjoying her life despite what she has been through. Thank you for sharing your story! The makeup turned out beautiful ladies 👍
Wow. I can't even do my makeup that well with a mirror.
Molly did a Great Job 👍🏻
She is so inspiring
She is such an inspiration to me she is so beautiful
Lol her makeup looks better than mine everyday even being able to see and having plenty of time
What a cool challenge!
When in doubt blend it out Kandee Johnson
molly's makeup came out really well! I did this challenge last year and my makeup came out better than when I do use a mirror  lol idk how that is lol
Kandee you’re so freakin rude!! Constantly talking over Molly! Btw your foundation is too orange, your contour is too dark and you’re uptight
I saw the title and knew it was Molly and got very happy
Why is she orange
9:44 Over blend......WHICH I DIDNT HAVE TIME TO OVER BLEND TODAY!!!!! Same girl same. Sometimes you have to scream to shut ppl up
How does she know where to look, like at the camera and stuff, she doesn’t even slightly struggle to differentiate the products , is she only partially blind? or can see shadow, shapes, light 🤷🏻‍♀️ My eye contact isn’t even that good and I have all my sight 😳
Rude as hell not letting molly get a word in. She is the guest on your channel, treat her like it rather than over powering her.
Is that girl REALLY blind?
People really questioning if she’s blind like who “fakes” that. People that are blind could see some light and shapes so obviously she could see the shape of the people talking to her
Did Kandee fr say it takes her 15 minutes to do a full face on average?? 
It takes me about an hour. 45 minutes if I'm rushed. I don't think I'm in the minority with this..
She is really inspiring!! But how do her eyes move like normal ?
omg kandee kept on cutting molly off
When I clicked on this video I thought she was going to kind of blankly stare at nothing. But she made eye contact with other people and camera and I was so surprised I even questioned if she was really blind. Im just so amazed
She really doesn’t seem blind
She doesn't really look blind
Wait isn't molly on like the dove commercial
You couldn't tell she was blind if you were just passing by because wow! She knows the people she's talking to and she's looking to her friend so Molly is very inspiring and amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Let the damn girl talk
Um hello can you let her talk:/
kandee just talks over the guest
if shes blind how does she look directly at the camera and at the girl next to her
Molly if no one knew you were blind then they wouldn't think you are. You do makeup like sighted people do!!
I also have retinitis pigmentosa,  I'm so excited to have found Molly now -thanks Kandee. She seems like such a beautiful soul. It's wonderful she's not letting this stop her passion. Very empowering.
wow, we all should take a page from Molly's book. what a positive and optimistic goddess in the face of so much adversity. made me a little emotional. and now I'm off to Molly's page for some more inspiration and good vibes.
Kandee looks like a carrot!! 😂
Hold up did anyone else notice that she said she ‘watches’ YouTube vids
I haven't seen it but I'ma go with the blind girl cause she must be used to it and the sighted one is not
I’m so confused. She doesn’t look blind at all😭😭💙💙💙💙
Stop interrupting her omg
I hate when people joke around about being blind it makes me sooo mad 😡
I really want to know if molly color blind or blind??(I am not rude) I am just asking!🙈
That red looks like it would compliment my skintone, anyone know the name? Seems to be a Mac lipstick but the only red Mac I own is ruby woo and it looks nothing like that lol 
Edit: I’m talking about Molly’s lipstick ☺️
You kept talking over her a lot, that was kind of rude.
I'm confused because she said she's blind but she is picking up her making up perfectly fine
She is amazing she’s blond but is so good about it she can look into the camera
Let her talk omg, like you just constantly interrupt her
Molly was amazing
Kandee girl stop talking over her xo
One of the most original videos I’ve seen in YEARS
Molly looks like she can actually see but she can't it's amazing
Let the girl talk and stop interrupting!
Well, of course the blind lady would win. She doesn’t use a mirror anyways. 
I grew up with a blind family friend. She was friggen awesome!!  She showed me so many different things about blind people. She did her own makeup and hair everyday. She picked out all of her own outfits as well. This women raised 2 boys on her own, flew a plane and drove a car. (Obviously she didn’t have a license it was just someone letting her drive the car on their property) I don’t know how but she could get places without a walking stick or a service dog at times. It was literally amazing!!! She is such a cool person. 
And she taught me that, it doesn’t matter. If you really want something, you’re gonna do it. 
❤️
This was a great idea, I loved Molly and it's noticeable that she has a great oratory ability. She could have given soo much more to this video if only you would've let her speak.
I couldn't handle trying to have a convo with the pink haired chick. After she cut me off the 3rd time I would just get up and be like BYE.
It’s really distracting how orange Kandee is in this video...
When in doubt, BLEND IT OUT😂
You’d think she was half deaf by the way that she constantly screams EVERY SINGLE MINUTE! 🙄 nice concept of a video but would be better if she wasn’t screaming and cutting off the guest every two seconds
Did anyone notice, Kandee kept inturupting, Molly? Geez, show some respect, Girl!
Molly was so good!!
Molly was talking about how she got over depression when she found out she was going to be blind, then Kandee is like "WHAT IS THE TIME OH MY GOSH THATS CRAZY AHHHH" and I'm just like bruh, she looks like a jersey girl that fell asleep on the beach.
How can she choose products without any problem
I have a hard time believing she is blind! She is just simply amazing...breaking all the stereotypes I know about blind people.
That looks good!
Keep calm and blend it out
The blind women is soooo beautiful
Ok I'm really confused on how she looked directly into the camera every single shot...
Your lighting is of a little
kandee was being so extra about the time
I LOVE MOLLY
Shes such a brave girl ❤️
Molly what do I see black or blue or something like that
If In doubt blend it out
She has the same voice as the girl from the inhaler vine 😂 😂
kandee was only wearing 1 hoop
Wait CANT She see a thing..??
If I didn’t know, I wouldn’t have even guessed that she’s blind
She's completely blind!?
Kandee stop interrupting molly
Molly's story is extremely inspirational, thanks for introducing us to her!
Let Molly talk omg 😂
Molly is awesome!  Is Kandee orange, or am I seeing things?
Well that couldn't have been more wholesome and sweet
Why is this sped up wtf
You both did so great!! Wow!!!
Any1 notice that Molly’s voice was like squeaky
LET THE GIRL TALK, DAMN FAM
OMG I FEEL LIKE I SAW HER IN A TV COMMERCIAL
Molly did a great job
She is so inspirational!! X
10:30 🤔
She can do her makeup better than I can and I can see❤️❤️
Poor Molly, girl you kept cutting her off and you could see her frustration u need to chill woman SO CRINGY
Is kandee the girl from reck it Ralph
When in doubt, blend it out
why are the voices off?
This is fascinating, you can see Molly looks towards the camera but her eyes never focus, you can see them constantly move around
Molly is an inspiration to everyone
They can still do their makeup better than me in ten minutes without a mirror
Molly was trying so hard to get a word in. So rude.
Molly doesn't look blind at all
She did very good as a blind person
One looks orange lol
I CLICKED ON THIS HOPING IT WAS MOLLY!
Hey Molly that was my question
I love this vid it’s beautiful
Wasn't she on a dove commercial?
so amazing kendee
aw this is so cute
Mollys makeup looks soooo good.
When in doubt blend it out
I couldn't even get past 5mins.  . . Please be quiet and let her talk.
I love Molly. I want to be just like her
their voices are higher than on molly's channel
Is she completely blind or only partly blind?
Molly was in a dove commercial
kandee was using the mirror of her eyeshadow palettes
“Beauty is something that should be felt in a dark room.” Love it Kandee!
How does she know where the camera is if she’s blind?
I don’t get it cause cameras have no sound
They both did so damn good
Kandee I love you but stop cutting off the girl 😭😂💜
This was made on my b day
Is it me or does kandee keep cutting her off mid sentence?
How did the 'Blind' girl know where EVERYTHING was ??????
Does she not sound like Rebecca Zamolo
Wait who's blind or what....? Oh I know
the fact that she's completely blind is really unbelievable honestly...I don't believe she is completely blind.
How does Molly know where the makeup is to pick up, and what makeup it is if she cant see?
When I first turned on this video I’m like wait... which one is blind? Lol bc Molly was looking at Kandee, she was looking at the camera.. and then I realized she was blind and i was just like, holy shit.. she is absolutely incredible. So inspirational. It just makes u feel so positive just listening to her and watching her. Truly Amazing.
Love ya n ur vids ur my og morrnvids pls love ur transformations and when you did look like this celebs and or when this celeb a specific look apppearence
OMG!! When I Was About 7 I Always Watched Kandee's Alice in Wonderland Queen of Hearts Look and I came to see if she still posts videos and OMG She Looks So Different I'm SHOOK! srsly go check out her Queen Of Hearts Look from 2009 and see How Much She Changed :0
who else heard her say doing eyelashes is like brain surgery😂 um no honey
wait is she fully blind or half blind
Who told her the lipstick was red
New sub 🎈
I am nearsighted
If molly can slay her makeup, then so can I with out my glasses
How is her eyeliner better than mine??? Wow
Not being rude but I’m just curious and confused... how do you watch YouTube if you’re blind...?
Molly is such an inspiration, she does her makeup a LOT better than me an other's.
Omg there both so amazing at makeup and to be able to do that without sight is amazing like my makeup always looks shit and I have full sight !!!
How does she do I liner when she is blind I can't do it at All
One of my friends is going blind and he's haveing a really hard time considering no one in our area knows Braille and he wants to write comic books.
I’m also blind and I always do my make up with no mirror and less than ten minutes lmao
Why are you a walking Cheeto
"I can do everything anybody else can do, I just do it in a slightly different way." That is the one thing I and every other disabled person most wish people without disabilities understood.
Molly is gorgeous.
Amazing video but I got annoyed every time Kandee spoke over Molly 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
That fromt view lighting makes Kandee look orange.
Is she fully blind or just kinda blind? I'm asking because the blind people I see have sunglasses
My mom has this and I help her walk and guide her
This woman’s amazing, but can she still see a little bit because she looks at some of the cameras, but this was awesome.
Molly is so pretty and fun! But why do you keep interrupting her, Kandee????
Molly is awesome but her lipstick has gone over her lipline
She doesn't seems completely blind. Because the way she is taking her makeup and keeping it back and looking
My dad has retinitis pigmentosa too. He’s 33 and almost completely blind
4:03 odd, i can't do mascara with a mirror
Molly is amazing! Thank you for featuring her Kandee, I didn't know about her yet! I did notice you talking over her but to me it was very obvious that it was because of the stress and the time limit, I'm sure she understands as well. Anyone familiar with you should be able to know that you wouldn't do that out of inconsideration. This is still a really good video to raise awareness and I love that you use your platform to do that. I'd love to see another video with you and her without the time constraint! Gonna check out her channel now 😊 Love from the Netherlands! 💕
molly doesn’t look blind at all
If ur conpletely blind how do  u watch youtube
For some reason  I don't believe  that she is blind cause of the signals  idk  it's just me if she is really  blink well good for her💜  ( no hate )
Cuz ou can't eat or watch tv for me I just listen to audio books or I just listen to the show or my mom reads to me
This comments section is pretty horrific between people telling Kandee that she was interrupting Molly, and analyzing how blind Molly is(!!!!). Are y'all serious???? Kandee isn't interrupting her. Their conversation is flowing and funny through this frantic state of rushing to put make up on while talking about Molly's amazing journey. And questioning the validity of how blind Molly is??!! Are you gross people for real? So gross. You don't even deserve to be addressed. 

For anyone who's fully visual, why don't you just be A LITTLE blurry while putting on make up. Blindness isn't always when you can see absolute darkness. Sometimes blind people can only see light -- that's still being blind because you can't see!

Kandee, I hope you're not listening to any of this negative garbage. This was so interesting and cool to watch, and funny!
At first when I read it i thought molly was in a blind fold and have fun  at vidcon!
Jeez she look HELLA orange
SHE LOOKS SO GOOD
Whenever in doubt blend it out
Molly is so good at doing makeup she is sooo inspiring
i recognize her from the Dove commercial
Molly needs to go onto The Ellen show and explain this to her about her journey through fashion and beauty and being blind then I feel like Ellen would love her story
this girl is amazing.....
Does she voice Violet in incredibles
She's so talented
such an inspirational story
Wait...how does she watch makeup videos if she is blind.
After watching this I realized I don't like Kandee at all.... thats sad
kandee stop interrupting!!! let the girl speak
If she's blind, why does she keep glancing over at Kandee?
omg kandee can you shut up and let molly talk
I was gonna chew all the people out who mentioned you interrupting her because I thought it was like the Jaclyn hill/kkw all over again BUT dang girl poor Molly couldn’t get a full sentence in!
This video just irritated me the whole time. Let her talk!! What's the point in doing a video with her when you don't let her talk?! And stop screaming in her ear!! 🙄😤
How does she know where each makeup product  is on the table if she is blind
I think molly still has some of her vision as she looks where she talks or something her eye is a bit shacks but she has a beautiful girl with amazing eyes and character
8:06 
Kandee: “How do you do your brows?”
Molly: “I’ve ju-“
Kandee: “OMG THIS IS SO HARD.”
Molly: “Yeah I-“
Kandee: “I shouldn’t have tried my brows.”

Kandee: “You can talk as much as you want while I do this.”

Jesus Christ let her talk. Molly literally had to yell at some points to get more than two words out! 😱🙄
I feel like the time limit was harder than no mirrior
who else thinks molly is good
Wow! You can't even tell!
Kandee, please respond to us and tell us why you were talking over her the whole time I would like to know because it was rude when she was trying to talk about going blonde, and you just changed the topic like please explain, and I would not be surprised if she didn't do another collaboration with you.
When she was doing her eyebrows and she wouldnt let Molly finish her sentence
how...does she know she looks 14....?
Is she actually blind?
I love Moly
Wow she looks perfectly normal but I feel bad
how does molly know where every thing is its weird
How is she blind but she's making eye contact with Kandee and the camera
Just wondering how can molly read the comments ??
No man who doesnt use make up should see this...then they'll know its possible to do your makeup in less than 10 minutes.. Lol
I noticed that you only have one earring on
to many ladies say like in nearly every sentence they say
This is literally the most positive colab I've ever seen ❤❤❤
That girl moves her eyes a lot for a blind person.... she looks at things
I wouldn't have known she was blind if they hadn't said anything
Doesn't seem she's blind to me👀
i honestly couldn’t tell that she was blind
Im going to vidcon next week and Im driving from Arkansas
that awkward moment when your blind and cant see what there makeup looks like
Why did they make their voices so high pitched???
The title is drastic
She's really cool, you don't even notice she's blind
She doesn't look younger without makeup at all..
Ya'll are so cute! 😄😄
She doesn’t look blind at all not only bc she is really good but bc it looks like she’s not blind
Wait if she's blind how does she know what the people are doing on the makeup tutorials?
she doesn't look blind cool but i feel bad for her
The blind girl was better
No hate but I really don't think she is really blind but it's just me
The makeup artist cheated because she has a mirror in the pallet
Kandee talked over molly to much and her face was to orange
It's cool how Molly says how she does things differently.  It's great how she adapted after she became blind.  She made the most of a life-altering situation, and ran with it.
For some reason I don’t believe she’s blind.
How do u know what colours you are choosing
I feel so bad for Molly
The way u out the foundation on 😩😩😣
How is she making eye contact when blind?
how does she know where her products are tho
1:18 how does she know she looks young but she is blind thoo..
So is she still blind or not.. coz she works like normal person... so It's hard to know for me
the black haired girl sounds like taylor reilly
Everyone’s bitching about Kandee talking over Molly but I don’t really think it was that bad. They both seemed to talk over each other. They were just talking as they went and it just seemed back and forth to me. It wasn’t that bad.
Even when Kandee said she wasn't gonna talk, she still manages to interrupt Molly. Love the video but really wish she listened more to her guest rather than feeling like she had to respond to everything she said.
What I would hate about being blind is not seeing my children (if I had any) grow up... Not a negative but I was just wondering what it would feel like.
Guys Kandee is naturally talkative and has a lot of energy. She was feeling rushed with the challenge. If this had been a get ready with me it would've been different.
I’m glad u did this video it was inspirational, u don’t need sight to do what u love
she don't look blind I would never know she is blind if i didn't read the title
I love how Molly does her makeup, like the way she puts it on her face
Why is it a no mirror makeup challenge she always got no mirror da FUQ
Does Molly’s voice sound high-pitched??
Lol I feel like Molly was getting annoyed ( I would have too if I was getting talked over!) I was getting annoyed just watching because Kandee kept talking louder over her!
Molly did a really good Job
I actually enjoyed this video. I don’t see or notice any of the flaws that some people are pointing out. To me it just felt like two friends sitting together and doing their makeup and catching up. My friends and I talk fast and are generally excited while telling stories, so this seemed so natural and normal to me. It was a pleasure to hear Molly’s story and the way she adapts is so inspiring, I love her messages. Thank you for introducing her to your audience Kandee! Much love to you both xo 💟🙏🏼
even when Kandee was doing the lips, and said she wasn’t gonna talk anymore, she was still talking over Molly!! lol
6:01 looks at mirror me :isn’t this supposed to be a no mirror challenge
Wow she does not look like a blind person because she makes eye contact while talking to people and the camera perfectly
I didnt notice Kandee talking over her the whole time, I actually think Molly spoke alot, so im not sure what everyone is talking about, maybe she started talking when she was once or twice but that happens when 2 people are having a conversation, Molly spoke alot about her story and how her experience with being blind has been, I enjoyed this alot, we love you Kandee!
Soo... Molly ur blind?
Why does she interrupt molly so much? Is that just how she is?
This video is how I found out about her
The Orange girl was kinda weird
Let her talk !!!!
How does she have a channel or go online w out being able to see ?
8:03 - 8:15 so cringy
im blind in one eye
Molly didn’t stop talking
Molly won by far
She is blind and can still do makeup better than me
What was that black liner that you were using?
Does anyone notice Molly from any big commercial..........?!?!? I'm so proud of her and inspired by her!
amazing
Why does kandee look extremely sunburned?
You hardly let her talk and kept talking over her..... 😕
Kandee, love you, but please stop interrupting?? It’s really rude and I cannot hear what molly is saying...
is she actually blind ? wtf hahah
kandee: im not gonna talk while i do the lips 
also kandee: constantly talking while doing the lips
uh kandees tan is uhh 😬ew
Dude let the poor girl speak ..
I don’t think she is actually blind
Is there a filter over their voices?
Kandee kept talking over molly
Even though she's a blind girl she doesn't let that getting her way
Molly’s outlook on life is so optimistic and it’s absolutely amazing!
Why this woman keep interrupting her and screaming all the time???? It got annoying pretty fast
It is so cool to watch her do makeup and be entirely blind. This was amazing!!
She’s blind and she does better makeup than me :o she’s so talented!
How did the Molly know the lipstick was red? Someone tell 'er in advance?
Molly's outlook on life is so positive and refreshing
Is she completely blind?
Kandee did have a mirror if you go to the bit where she was doing her eye shadow on the pallet they was a mirror on it
Still looks better than I would doing my own makeup WITH a mirror!
Wait can she still see x
She is more orange than trump.
why is kandee orange
jeez... stop interrupting molly. imt rying to listen to her, not you with your annoying voice.
How do you watch YouTube do you just listen to it if this is rude I'm sorry
I'm deaf and I was bitten by a shark so I can't walk on my left foot. I used to be bullied and told I can't do something but that made me want to do more. Like I was told I would never sing or talk normal. Well I'm now a singer. The bad times make me want to,keep going.
10:52 How ironic!
This other girl doesn't seem blind
My name is Molly to
Is it just me or does Kandee sound like Penelope (Not sure if thats her name) from reck it ralph?
It takes me around 5 seconds to do my makeup
I love Molly ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
let the girl talk
All y'all mad about the oompa loompa interrupting Molly but totally cool with all these people trying to call Molly a fake because she doesn't "act" blind

HOWS A BLIND PERSON SUPPOSE TO ACT???? I'm legally blind but you wouldn't know it unless I told you. And before anybody yells at me for typing a comment, there is this thing called VOICE COMMANDS.
Molly doesn't look blind because she knows where's the cam., the make-up, and Kandee.
Anyone else notice their voices are sped up?
who is the blind 1
also how does she know where all the makeup is
She's blind wow
Ok this kandee girl is SO ANNOYING.
shes blind and can still do better makeup than me
Wow!!!!
I think the blind girls was better 😂😂 how can she tell where her eyebrows are 😲😲
If you are blind can you still do stuff like a normal teen
kandee kept interrupting her
Pore molly is trying to speck but kandee won’t let her. Go to 8:14
How can she watch youtube videos without actually being able to see it
Lol she did better eyeliner without sight and mirror than me with both
😐🤔no offence but she doesn't seems to be blind...by the way she is looking at the other girl and talking and picking up the... things... It's totally not believable... 🙄 !!!???
I don't think that Molly is really blind because she looks at everything like she can see it
Very cool video, but Molly didnt feel completely blind, as in, can not see anything. The eye contact, knowing where to grab the products, and knocking over a bottle around 6:30 and imediatly picking it up without having too feel where it went. Idk. Maybe im wrong, and you can still have shiet eyesight, but she did not seem 100% blind. Also as someone who has a blind grandmother, her eyes are very active, which seems strange. But cool video! <3
I don't think Molly is completely blind, I think she can see shapes... because when she was using the mascara, when she dipped back into the bottle, she looked at it.... but looking at it, if you're completely blind, wouldn't benefit you so a completely blind person would not look at it... i think she can probably see shapes and Shadows
My brother is blind this is so touching!
I like molly
Lol she makes so much eye contact with being blind
Their voices sound slightly higher than normal in this video.. Especially noticed this on Molly's voice
Kandee could be cheating and have a mirror far away and Molly would never know
Mollyyyy 😎❤️
The blind girls makeup is better than mine and I can see (obviously since I’m typing this comment)
What an inspiring and beautiful person you are Molly! I wish you so much success and happiness in your life xo
I think when two people who make YouTube videos do a collab they always tend to over talk or interrupt each other because they’re used to talking on their own channels...so just chill and watch the video and if you’re annoyed then don’t watch....
She is not blind she knows where everything is wtf ?!
Their skin tone differences is so funny to me, I've never seen either girls videos but now I'm a fan.
Half way through the video I remembered that she was blind
Guys quit being rude OK just quit I see that she was interupting but that's OK my grandpa is just like that a lot of people are relax!!
the girl in the right is a little too orange.
They make me happy
Lookin like a Cheeto ma dude 🧡
please stop interrupting her tho...
She kept talking over the girl
Her voice sounds different
Everyone's acting like Kandee put duct tape over Molly's mouth, calm down people. When people interact it's VERY common for people to talk over each other, I highly doubt that you triple check that your friends have stopped talking before you bring up your point.
She doesn't seem blind. She could take all the make-up easily.
she's so orange
The comments section make me ashamed of everyone.. accusing Molly of faking blindness? And kandee supposedly interrupting her... they're talking back and forth.. Molly talks just as much it's conversation!
how does she know what she watches on youtube
I found Molly from Drew's video and binge watched her videos last night.

She is cool as hell. I love hearing her talk about being blind and how it can be positive.
I couldn't tell molly was blind
Oh my goodness I love it. Molly looks like a brunette Elsa! Lovely job ladies!
Oml that girl has the exact same eye disease as my step dad
My dad and two of his brothers were born with retinitis pigmentosa. I'm so happy that Molly can share her story, thank you for introducing us to her!
Hey my names Molly, but spelled Mollie.
That girl is fricking gorgeous and powerful! Love her💟
How does she know what products are which ?
why does the blind girls makeup look so much better then the girl who can see ?
She doesn’t look blind at all
Molly kinda looks like Tessa Violet
I dont want to be rude but if your blind dont you not blink
The blind girl is obviously not gonna need a mirror it’s not a challenge for her lmao
Ok not trying to be rude but I believe that some people would actually like to hear Molly speak I don't know if that sounds rude if so I am very sorry but I want to know how she does this everyday but this was a great video and you are both very talented and did an awesome job keep at it love your videos.
Is she completely blind, or can she still see general shapes? She does seem to see where things are, like the makeup.
I thought she said she’s blind? But how can she know which one is the make up? That means she can see it? I’m so confused😂 someone please explain
Does the Cheeto really need to shout OH MY GOSH whenever he gives the time?
I've never thought of it like Molly said - if she wasn't blind, she wouldn't have some of her problems but others would take their place. That's incredibly true and realistic. If I didn't have my PTSD, depression, anxiety, and chronic migraines, other problems would take their place.
''do sight girls do that!?''
Imagine everyone being blind and people treating people by their actual personality
So wait I’m confused. Is she blind or not. In the little clips she put in she looked able to see and same with the actual video.
Is it just me or the blind one really doesn’t seem to be blind.....? (I mean she knew EXACTLY where everything was. Idk maybe i can be wrong)
Molly doesn't look 14 without makeup... She actually does look like a 20 something woman to me still even without it on. I fear I look young without makeup on. Honey, you look just fine!
My brother has retinituspigmentosa too x
Why can Molly do her makeup better than me, and I’m sighted???
ok...so kandee needs to shut the f up....so glad when at 6:00 molly starts pushing back because molly is so beautiful and intelligent she shouldnt have to put up with someone stepping all over her like that
Not gonna lie, Kandee I thought you were doomed with the amount of foundation and how dark that contour was! But you saved it pretty damn good! Molly - you are so amazing! I'm so impressed with your positivity and perseverance! Keep it up! You both looked amazing at the end and better than I can do my make up on a good day, with a mirror! Lol!
How can you see straight at the camera if you can’t see and how do you see sraight at her.
6:01 Looks at the mirror
Wow how can the blind girl know what foundation is what
On the left won wow 😍 slutty make up to the right 😅😭
She is sooooooooo pretty
At 7:18 I heard I wish everybody dead instead of everybody did
Wait how can she know what the product is when she is blind?
Not to be rude but is this click bait? I don’t really believe that Molly is blind coz she was finding everything so easily
she dosn't look blind she looks great
i feel like Kandee cheated because she looked at something the whole time!!!!!
Did anyome notice that kandee looked in one place everytime she did the makeup
How do you watch
I love Molly she's my hero
Her voice reminds me of the girl off that one zombie movie it’s so cute well at least to me it is 😂😂 Molly’s just so cute in general
How? I can have an hour and 15 mirrors and my makeup looks so much worse than both of theirs! 😩 They are both beautiful ladies inside and out!
how do people do their make up, liquid foundation specifically with their hair down and over their forehead. i just don't get it, it's forsure in her hair.
Molly u r my hero, not because ur blind, but because u choose not to be negative. God bless you.
She didn’t look blind at all!!!
She's the girl from that dove ad
Molly has truly inspired me! Now every time I do my makeup I will always think of Molly and really appreciate the fact that I have my sight.
Is she blinded no I'm sorry I'm dumb but can some bnody reply
Hey Everyone!!! I would really appreciate you checking out my NO MIRROR 💜 Makeup Challenge!!! It was really fun seeing how I did without a mirror hehe (:
i'm legally blind and i will probably be totally blind by the time i'm 30 (about 8.5 years) which is terrifying, but i have my white cane and my supportive family and my amazing friends and people like Molly to help me. thank you <3
Wait I don’t understand Molly can tell what the make up is I’m not calling her a lier  but...
i love this channel a lot! Molly and Kandee are big inspirations <3  ( :  I just wanted point out that in the video Molly says something about her looking like she's 14 w/ no make up on.... But how would she know this if she is blind, and doesn't remember what she looks like (she said that on james charles video) love you kandee!
I honestly do not think she's blind and ik people are gonna hate on me for saying that but it's my opinion and Idc what you have to say about it. Plus there is no way she can't see the products and know where they are and I think it's an act.
I feel so bad for Molly because if you look closely you could see her struggling to look at the camera a little bit.
Kandee looks like a Oompa Loompa
She sounds like the girl off of reck it Ralph the little girl! Penelope? Not Molly the other girl does
when the girl with the colourful hair didn't blend her eyeliner she would've done better
It’s really cool, seeing that a blind girl can do her makeup that good, and she said she can do it better but she’s rushed. That really inspires me just to do what makes me feel comfortable, and she’s obviously doing what makes her feel comfortable because she doesn’t care what ppl say she looks like. That’s why I love her!
Wow! She is amazing ❤️ what a beautiful woman and so inspiring 💋💪👍🙌🤝🙏 and you both did your make-up so good 😀 thank you Kandee for sharing her and her story. I'm gonna go check out her channel right now.
if i'm being honest, for some reason i can't believe that she's blind. she keeps looking at everything and doesn't knows exactly what every product is and what brush to use. i'm sorry but she just doesn't seem blind to me.
Is it weird that she doesn’t look blind?Does that even make sense?🙃
Personally I thought Molly talked a lot. They both did. Annoying
STOP INTERRUPTING!
She has really good control of where her eyes wander. Usually blind peoples eyes' wander endlessly
She looks so orange!!😂😂😂😂
shes not blind I mean how could she see her eyeshadow and everything
Omg Kandie piled on the foundation
How does she know where everything is?
.... Why does she keep talking over her???? Wtf how rude
Mollyyyyyy!!!!
I feel like this video is speed up they so so weird
Is... Kandee looking in the viewfinder??
Is she fully blind or...
That red hair so bad.. dont let the black hair speak!
Does anyone know the name of the pink powder brush Molly is using??
Marvellous!
I can get my makeup done in 5 minuets... if I’m in a hurry 2 minutes.  But I don’t do any contouring so that saves me time.
Kandee No effence , but you are orange
Molly is such an inspiration. God bless her.
dude why is kandee orange?
Why is kandee so orange????
Are you sure she’s blind? because she is SO good, and looks like she can see!
she’s orange wtf
so she likes makeup to conform?
Pause at 5:45
Kandee looks like she’s on drugs
lol I can't get my makeup to look this good even with a mirror.
Wait. This is the first video I've watched by this creator. Is the lady on the right, the one with the pink hair, super orange because she got a tan? Or is it the lighting? Does she naturally have the orange tone? Does anyone else notice this?
If I ever do makeup, it literally takes like five minutes. They were panicking after it had been a minute? It takes more than 4 minutes just to do lipstick? Wow it would take me like 30 seconds for lipstick even if using lipliner
Im looking at this girl doing her makeup that is blind and can find her makeup faster then I can and I can see. That girl is amazing
wow
Kandee yu put on a ton of foundation. No wonder you have no foundation in the bottle
Is Kandee looking in the view finder, or is that just me? :/
The one girl kept cutting molly off and I was like shut up omg
Is she completely blind? Because her eyes follow everything and look specifically at items and into the camera and at her friend etc
Kandee looks kinda orange
I personally have a pet peeve of when people talk over me or interrupt me when I'm talking. Kandee, I know you didn't mean to, but sometimes it's best to hold your thoughts in until the other person is finished talking. It makes watching the video a bit hard...
How does she know when things work? Does she ask ppl
kandee sounds a bit like rebecca zamalo
Why does she look at her palate if she is blind
Omg so I'm just cruising through YouTube watching whatever comes up on the recommended thing and this catches my attention. Well I see Molly and I'm all like... I think I'm subscribed to her... Than I go look and YES! omg this is awesome! Commenting at 1:53
EXPOSED!!!!!SHE AIN'T BLIND !!!!bc how did she know where the stuff is (the make up ) and knows where her eyes are soo they were making eye contact sooo EXPOSED!!!!
Let the poor girl speak
One of the most meaningful videos I've seen on youtube in awhile
The pink head had a mirror in her eye shadow palette
Does anyone else think that the video is speed up just a little bit? 10:10
Im not saying that molly is not blind but did anyone see how fast she grabbed that little tub with out  filling it.
I don't get you people. To me Molly is talking non stop and the other one is throwing in a few words because molly just doesn't stop talking
kandee talks over molly so much it’s irritated that’s so rude
How’d she know where all the products were and knew what colours they where and just knew exactly what everything was
This may sound strange but Kandee you have the cutest voice ever!
For everyone saying kandee talked over molly...Molly talked alot, (she's just talkative, not a bad thing) if kandee wanted to talk, she had to talk over molly! Molly wasn't shy and quiet or sounded like she felt upset in anyway by anything kandee was doing.  Anyway, all no mirror collabs are like this between friends,shouting, panicking,talking over each other
Her positive outlook on life is beyond amazing. ❤💙❤💙
Is the audio pitched a little higher? Sounds strange
This video stressed me out 😂
p.s.girl with a hat the front view you look very red
That. Was. Awesome. I subscribed as soon as she said she was blind and she was gonna put makeup on by herself. Girl, you inspire me!
I’m sorry.. but how does she watch your YouTube videos if she’s blind??
Understandable, Kandee was under pressure it was new for her, stressful, whatever. But, HOW. RUDE. So annoyed at her interrupting Molly mid sentence, so uncomfortable/cringy to watch. 😣☹️
She does Not Look blind
How she blind if she could see the things she needs to put on
Is Kandees skin orange?
I recognize her from those Dove commercials 😁 beautiful! 
✌❤😁
I think it's crazy how well she knows where to look like I would have easily thought she could see because she was looking in all the right places and like has like normal eye actions. I don't really know how to put it but it is like crazy.
Okay so is the microphone broke, or is their voices edited to sound higher..?? Molly’s voice sounds higher and Kandee’s voice just sounds absolutely atrocious
She could get her eyebrows micro bladed
HOLY ORANGE
No body would guess she’s blind
My aunt that eye diese to. She has not yet gone blind buts she may soon
Geeeee. What do you know.  How cool. A video with a blind person in it commented on by ppl with hearing problems cos it is clearly stated in the video that she lost the majority of her eye sight when she was 14. That my dear hearing impaired judgemental peeps would make her legally blind. Kandee ur doing good. Ur videos are good. U r a ray of sunshine amongst all the crap going on in this world.  Just keep being you. xxx
Why did you pitch the voices up? I watch enough of Molly to know this isn’t her voice. I know the “high pitched voice” is your brand but seriously....?
Why is kande so dark
11:53 WTF WAS THAT KANDEE
Kandee looks orange🍊😂
Hella copied Shane
Omg how does she know which is which
Wish you didn’t talk over her the whole time. Made it very irritating to watch. Molly is beautiful.
Isn’t she in the dove commercial
Who saw Molly’s eyes shake at 13:07
Kandee is so orange she looks like Donald Trump!
It looks like she's not blind
Pink hair
Omg love you guys!!!!!!!! Molly is amazing
She doesn't seem blind how she know which palett to pick up.... How she turning to look at kandee when speaking
Omfg kandee let her talk
A lot of people in my family have the disease
Poor Molly had to raise her voice in order to get a few words in. This girl is so rude.
oh nvm
Ok but why is she so orange?
I love how Molly’s story isn’t just another hard luck “oh poor me” story
i can't even tell your blind! you have eye contact with kandee! and your eyes are not foggy your awesome!!
Ro looks like vanellope but Kandee sorta sounds like her
What's weird is that Ro LOOKS like Vanelope but Kandee SOUNDS like Vanelope O.o
Even without makeup ro looks gorgeous ❤️
KANDEE SOUNDS LIKE VANELLOPE VON SCHWEETZ
Rosanna looks so cute!. And at 14:22 she reminded me about her old videos😘
Who else do you think Rosanna looks like?!? Besides the cutest thing in the world!
Even without makeup Ro is beautiful
She is so bueatiful
Incredible, Kandee you did so good and Ro looks so cute.

omg I accidentally deleted my old comment where I got noticed lmao
but I reply to kandee: when you laugh its just like..pure joy or something i dunno lol Its what I imagine entering the gates of heaven sounds like 😂😂
I was literally so depressed today about my fatness...then I saw this video and now I wanna go bake cupcakes and give them to the less fortunate :-)
OMG roll looks just like her sister without makeup on OMG but she looks so cute though.
Oh Kandee🌹😍🔥Love the tutorial + the way u laughed & had fun boosts more energy 🎉☄😂😝
Literally the two sweetest humans on the planet, I'm getting cavities watching this video 💜
So, don't get me wrong I love, love, love this collab, but I'm wondering, cause in every collab on YouTube on one channel they say "we just did a video on her/his channel" and on the other channel they say the same think...I mean for which channel did you do a video first....im just confused 🤔....but i loovee this collab, you too are sooo sweet❤️❤️❤️ like if you agree!!!
Wreck it Ralph two is coming out in March 2018
Omg
Ro...
Make a video WITHOUT MAKE UP
U ARE SO PRETTY
Omg ro without fake eyelashes




But I love her
Is it just me or does kandee’s voice kinda sound like venelope’s from wreck it Ralph. Just a little...
Once my friend curled my eyelashes and she tried to flipping curl my eyelid 😭😂 IT HURT SO BAD 😭
It will be kinda sad to put all that effort in the makeup transformation and then, after the video, just take it all off. 😭Also, my eyebrows are twins.
It looks really good but the wig is a bit to big.... but other than that good job 👌
OMG Kandee your nails 💅🏻 are so gorgeous
“It hydrates your cells, so they don’t get into raisins.” 😂 Oh, Kandee.
OMG Ro with out makeup💄
And by the way I saw the goose behind the window it just popped up lol so cute😽😸😹
Ro  looks so sweet so cute and the shirt matches amazing ro is like so sweet❤❤❤❤ⓇⓇⓇⓇⓇ♥♥♥

I enjoyed this video so much! Both of you seem very sweet and fun. The final look is very accurate and cute :)
Please make a DIY for the wig! It looks AMAZING!! This was soo cool!
Thank you Kandee for adding joy to my day.  I literally check several times a day, hoping that you've posted a new video.  I ADORE you!!!!  I'd never heard of Rosanna before - and she's adorable.  Personally, I think that her cheekbones, eyes and nose look more like Kristin Chenoweth - heck even some of her mannerisms remind me of Kristin.  Did I mention that I adore you?  Gosh, I watch you and speak of you so often that even my husband knows of you.  :-)  May you have a blessed day!
Ro is so popular, she’s the best. no makeup Ro is glorious
Your makeup is so good I love how you did on Ro you are a makeup genius
Ur such a vibrant yet calm personality
"YOU DON'T THINK THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M THE MOTHERFUCKING GLITCH?"

Never seen her without makeup! She's still so cute.
Rosanna is the most adorable young lady. I love her. She makes a great Vanellope.
Ro you look sooooo pretty with out make up
this video is the best birthday gift I could receive :)
Ro you are looking like you without makeup
14:17 the swan was coming in to see the finishes look!😂😂
Either there is a bunch of weird frame cuts [and like extra frames] or the drugs have rotted my brain hahaha. Rosanna is sooo cute. Perfect character for her she looks already like her! Wait I just looked up Ro's age- holy crap she's a year older than me. Wow I gotta drink more water!
Love this! Hey Kandee the part where you said it's according to which brand of false lashes you buy and cheaper options being harder, which brand makes the easiest application? I struggle so bad applying falsies and wing liner and anything that could help applying them info wise would be awesome! I've been thinking about buying the new Ardell Magnetic lashes in the style Demi whispies thinking that might be a easier option for me. But I haven't tried but mainly drug store brands of lashes and I received a nice big set from boxycharm by PUR but I struggle and I can't get them on at all!
Oh my god why dose Kandee sound like vanellope soo much and ro looks like her
I love Rosannas shirt in this video! KANDEE  did an amazing job!
I totally love you kandee and ro
Ro is still beautiful with or without makeup.
What happened at 5:56?

I love you Kandee❤️😘 Earlier this year my dad passed away suddenly, and all your videos, snaps, and sweet words about how you're living bigger & bolder in your dad's honor have helped me so much❤️😘 I've been watching you since the very beginning & had no idea that one day I would need those words of comfort so much in the wake of loss🙏 Thank you for being a kind-hearted sparkly angel for all us Kandee❤️✨ You're truly beautiful inside & out and I love you so much😘
That LM powder has parabens! I just can’t bring myself to use it. But that RCMA palette, I have it in my kit cause of you! I read about the #10 and #11  palettes in your blog a couple years ago.

I LOVE YOU!!! You inspire me every single day!
I needed that hug! You had an amazing 2017 and I can't wait to see all the things you accomplish in 2018! You make my days brighter dear <3
Kandee, you're such a positive person, thank you for being you 🙏😇❤️🇵🇱God Bless you Always 
Big big big heart from my polish heart to yours 🤗🤗☺️
I am with you 100%
I wasn't crazy about LM's powder. Maybe I got a wonky batch but my skin type is super dry so 🤷🏻‍♀️
Kandee  Will you do a look for the model that was in the bookstore scene on the movie Funny Lady with Audrey Hepburn.  I mean the model in the black dress, she looked STUNNING and I think you would be perfect to do her look!
Yessss I love that you mentioned Fullips! That is one of my biggest beauty secrets also! I have tried its competitors and Fullips is by far the best!! If you really want to go crazy, I recommend using GrandeLips (in Sephora) with it. Its a gloss that over time builds up collagen, so over time your lips STAY plump!! They are seriously the perfect duo for anyone that wants to enhance or even out their lips!! I highly highly recommend also. Love you Kandee! Happy New Year!! 💖💖
2017 has been good, not bad. Hope 2018 will be even better! Happy New Year!!
Upload everyday forever because I love watching you and how bubbly you are it makes my depression stop for the few minutes I watch you!  ❤️
kandee I'm going to do it with you!! let's get in shape!! I've been watching since 2008. love you so much xxxx
You do not know how much your words mean to us via Snapchat. Could be the worst day ever, like the day my mom passed away, and I know I can open your Snapchat story and find endless words of love and encouragement. Thank you for always being so real.
I'm gonna be on that journey with u and I can't wait 😘😘😘😘😘 love u to
Only 1 minute in so far, and I feel better already!
Love you girl!! Thanks for always being awesome ❤ You always make me smile!
I truly want to thank you for bringing up my mood and energy and just vibrations! You're so contagious and I'm obsessssed haha

Love you Kandee! You're the sweetest most kindest, and genuine beauty YouTube by far, on this platform, and I am certain one of the best humans on this planet. Shout out to your mama! Good work Mama Johnson!
Anyone else missing her old videos? I feel like her content has changed alot. I've been watching for years. I'm hoping she's just busy right now hustling, doing business and rocking out collaborating with companies, but I can't lie. I miss the old vids. Not hating at all, I love kandee and wish her all the success and happiness. Just wondering if I'm the only one who has noticed the change.
I really just need to know what brand and color you use for your hair 🤷🏻‍♀️😍
i just noticed you sound like my favorite movie character ever. Tank Girl!
I want to thank you for always being a positive face on this world wide Web!  This place can be so negative and I admire your ability to remain a influencer with no hidden agenda, with no alternative motive other then to help people feel better about themselves! It's really something to be said about you and the presence you hold on the internet! Keep up your hard work, you're amazing and I look forward to seeing what you'll do in 2018!
I just discovered you from Revenge Body With Khloe Kardashian from season 2 episode  1 😀😀😀
Does anybody else get my excitement or no
You're so incredible in your words are so inspiring keep being you beautiful don't ever change
You're so beautiful inside and out. Such an inspiration, I love you!!!
I'm so existing, like for the new year, you make me love the future thanks so much I love you and I wanna meet you so bad but in my country we are so forgotten like we don't exist 😢
Yes girl yes!!!  The Anastasia brush is my favorite and I literally use it everyday along with my fabulous dip brow!!  I just love you, and I think what sets you apart from all the other mua's is that even though you got a collaboration with too faced, "" which is my favorite "" by the way, but what makes you likeable and so easy to watch is that I haven't seen you change who you are or how you act just because you got your moment in the spotlight. I love that about you. It didn't go to your head like it did with some of the others. And for that reason I know that you will continue to go forward. You make people feel good about themselves and you are just awesome.
Kandee you are my favorite YouTuber of all time. My boyfriend was at Walgreens and he saw your shampoo and conditioner display and called me and asked if I needed them cause he knows how much I love you!! ❤️❤️❤️
Kandee I love your video's! You're so gorgeous! I love the collab that you did wroth Too Face! I can't wait to see what other plans and thing's you do in 2018! Much love top you from me in Detroit, Michigan xoxo!

Watching your videos always make me smile. Happy New Year Kandee. Hoping it’s the best year for you! Let’s get fit together! I lost 68 pounds last year and hope to lose another 50 this year. Let’s get on this journey! ❤️💪🏼
Love you, Kandee!!!! Have your palette!!! 😘😘😘
Your eyeshadow palette is the only eyeshadow I use! I love that I can use it for every season and it STILL smells good!!
You are a ray of sunshine and a breath of fresh air.  May 2018 be the best yet!
I've been watching you for years and I'm so proud of what you have done for yourself and your family and you have stayed so true to yourself. You are a beautiful person inside and out Kandee!
Happy New Year K.a.n-d.e.e!! :D All the best for you and your family and that 2018 be amazing for you guys! <3
My 2017 STARTED with me having a heart attack! 
2018 CAN ONLY GO UP FROM HERE! LoL🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️😂
I got a gift card and ordered your palette for Christmas. It's stuck in the mail but I'm soooo excited to try it! I can't wait!
2017 was bad?  Wow, seems like you had a lot of success
I must be the only one in the world who hates the Laura Mercier powder. That stuff makes me look dry, cakey, and gross
you bring so much joy to my life with every video, instagram post, and tweet I see! Been watching your videos since Ellie was born! Love you so much kandee!! All the best of luck to you and your family in 2018, and I'm so excited to see the new videos the new year brings:)
Love you Kandee <3
I love that your favorites are almost always the same. You don't feel the need to change just to fit some new trend which is awesome.  :)
Your palette is going to be at Mecca?!! Yay! 💖💖Any other parts of the collection too? So sad I couldn’t get your banana powder or lip products.
😂 lol'd at you saying "ooo dee" instead of urban decay lol love you xx
I was really laughing at the "oooodie ..urban decay make up setting spray" hahah
Oh man I'm watching this while eating lo mein hah... guess I should put the fork down and join in on the best shape of our lives journey :)
Happy New Year Kandee! 😚 💙💚💛💜💖
I love your videos to much Kandee💞
I have to say...I have admired and loved you and your videos for years. Happy new year
I love the dark roots😍
Happy New Year! You are an inspiration. <3
thank you for doing what you do! i dream of meeting up with you and having you teach me how to do my makeup to make me feel more confident. Lately even makeup is making me sad, i can never afford or find light enough products. Its sooo discouraging! and I LOVEEEE MAKEUP!
Found the nose itch culprit... At 7:12 a fuzz flies through the air!! 😆 I got you Kandee girl 😘
I love you!
I love your eyeshadow palette. So so much! I even bought an extra as backup because I will cry when I don’t have it to use anymore!!!
Love you Kandee!  Your happiness & good attitude always add a little sparkle to even my worst days. You are such an inspiration to me & I cant wait to follow along on your fitness journey in 2018. Huge hugs from my house to yours 😊🖤
3:12 a bonus
Please tell me where you got your earrings!?!?!
LOVE that ur so REAL. We ALL go thru things so true. I will 50 soon and have and been thru a lot. But we CAN make it and it’s worth u learn a lot. Remember that’s why we do go thru things sometimes is to learn something about life. And it’s Better after U do learn it. U know how to avoid it in the future. Love I use Clinique u never hear about them and they have some AWESOME products and have many yrs. thanks so much for sharing 💙💙💙
Kandee, you are such an awesome person and I love you and your videos 🙂❤️❤️❤️
Im curious about the lip plumper thingy at the end.
I bought all 4 of the lip colors and the gumdrops shampoo and conditioner...wish they could stay forever.
I really hope you are right about a better year coming out of 2017. My magical 6 year old daughter passed away in a tragic accident in October. So that's how my family ended our year.
Sugar cookie is my hands down fav!!!! After I bought it i went back the next day and bought what they had left. Lol which was like 12 conditioners and 13 or 14 shampoos so yeah very good smelling stuff. Xoxox
I absolutely love your Sparkling Cider shampoo&conditioner! I bought the Gumdrop version for Christmas presents for my friends!Any bottles I see left at Walmart I'm snatching up.Thanks so much for making them!!!!!
I got so excited when I saw your shampoo! (I'm in Mexico, so we don't get things when you do in US or we don't get them at all). It's the brand I use, so I have several, but I had to buy one, just because of you. I smelled them and decided I would take one of each and now I keep washing my hair every time it stops smelling as the shampoo. It's awesome. You are awesome. Thanks a lot for the channel and the products and smiles. Lots of hugs. 😘
Yes Kandee! I can't wait to see your health and fitness journey for 2018. I am with you. My resolution is to make '18 all about mental and physical wellness, taking a break from my classes for ME! I have 70 lbs to lose to hit a healthy BMI , and if I can lose 50 of that I'd be happy!!! A lb a week!!!!
Kandee, when you say “I love you guys” and give us an air hug, I can feel that it’s genuine. Thank you for all that you do! ❤️
Love when you post videos! You're so upbeat and positive! Like my one-sided YouTube bestie lol
Can't wait to join you on that fitness journey!!
2018 lets do this 🎉🎉🎉
omg i got your frosted sugar cookie shampoo and conditioner for christmas and i love them!♥️♥️
Happy New Year Kandee!! We are entering a great year can't wait to see what else you create & accomplish!!!!
I love your sparkling cider shampoo and conditioner! I bought every bottle my local store had in stock cause I get compliments daily.
Awesome products. I really love watching your videos and I get so happy when I see you on my subscription box. I also love the inspirational things you post on IG
Your the best Kandee! You've given me sooo many tips & lots of laughs in 2017, I'm looking forward to 2018 with you. I would love to join you on your workout adventures but I'm having major ankle surgery on Jan. 24th, I won't be able to walk for 3 months. The healing process from my surgery is supply be a year but I'm hoping I'll kick butt and heal faster. 2018 is going to be great!🎉❤️
Sweet'n Sour is my most favorite lip color in all my 200 plus lipstick collection 💋💋💋
I’m with you, Kandee!!! Let’s get in the best shape of our lives!
You forgot your nail colors as well! I love supporting everything you do because I truly feel you care about the products and us, your consumers. You are such an awesome, uplifting person and am lucky to follow you. Congrats on another successful year! Super excited for your motivational 2018 videos! 💜💜
Let’s do this Kandee! I’m with you all the way. I’m entering my 40’s this year 😬 and want to do it with a positive mind and healthy body ❤️I need the motivation, so I’ll be looking forward to your videos. Here’s to 2018 🍻
I love how you actually use your makeup, unlike most influencers on YT. Some packages are full of makeup smudges, hit pan on some products.... its awesome!
Kandee, do a makeup vid of the model in Funny Face in the bookstore segment!  That makeup was spectacular!  just a suggestion!  Thanks!
You’re the best! Love you Kandee, God bless you!
That powder puff😂😂😂😂❤❤❤ love it!
Love you!  I really liked your nail polish colors, too.  Keep all the Kandee Kolors coming, Please!  SOXO
Love you Kandee!  Please explain to me the reason for having products for sale but once they are sold out they won't be available again?  That makes no sense. I've been saving up to buy a few items but no point now.
can you please do a video on wearing just concealer and powder? as a base
Best wishes to you and your family in 2018 ❤️
Hey Kandee, I love you!  Is that shampoo available in the UK?? xxx
Kandee, you brighten up my day, everytime i watch your videos. I suffer severe depression and you honestly make me forget about it for the time im watching your happy smiling face and uplifting words. Thankyou so much from Australia. x
I love the sparkling cider shampoo and conditioner it’s absolutely amazing wish it was all year around it’s Christmas all the time. Xoxo happy new  year

Aww love you Kandee! Thank you for the inspiration in the beginning !! Xxoo happy new year! God bless! Wow you’ve been using that RCMA palette for yeaaars wow since i started watching you in old videos! And cherry Mac lip liner. Lol so cute i love your videos & you! Oh and you forgot your infamous chapstick that you use all the time❤️ i got hooked on them ! It’s so amazing to see you evolve and become so successful !! Xxoo
Love you so much. I've been following you for what seems like forever. Im a mom of 3 and have struggled so much with self worth and self confidence. If o could ever be successful..But you help me with that. Thank you for being such a positive light in my life.
Thanks for vid pretty lady
Kandee!!! You’re the best, and my absolute FAVORITE! (...fangirl since 2011!!!) Thanks for your great advice and amazing encouragement! Blessings in 2018!!!
You have such fine facial bone structure! Has anyone told you that?
I have the candy gum drop shampoo and conditioner... LOVE! Smells so good and my hair is soo soft!
Have a great new year, I’ll be trying to get fit with you it’s one of my resolutions! i love you and your channel and oh my gosh i loooove your eyeshadow palette i got it for christmas😍😍
Love you Kandee!!! Can’t wait to see where the New Year takes us!! I’ve battled depression really bad this year and hearing your positive words helped bring a smile to my heart. You even liked one of my posts on Facebook when I bought your I Want Kandee items at Ulta....the day they were released! Made my day for sure!! Love you doll!!! Don’t ever stop being the sincere, genuine, loving person you are!!! ❤️💋😘
You’re such an inspiration, Kandee💕 
People don’t realize just how hard some of our lives are and the crappy things that are constantly trying to break some of us down daily. Then, no matter how down I may feel, you have me smiling not even 1 min into your videos. 
Even if you’re not talking “directly” to me, the things you say along with your amazing, kind, caring personality makes me feel better for that moment...... and I need that. Thank you, Kandee......  🤗 Love you! 😘
Love you Kandee<3 I hope have a wonderful new years!!:)
💕💕 I use your I want Kandee palette everyday !! 🙌🏼🙌🏼 glad I got it the day you launched ! 🙀
I love your videos, Kandee! But I do miss the makeup tutorials and hope to see more in 2018. I know your a busy gal though and I'm super proud to see what you've accomplished over the past eight years or so!
I've been following you for Years now. . .like, 9 years??  I can't remember.  It's been a long time.  However, I JUST learned how to subscribe, like, and do the bell thing. . .so sad.  And this is my first comment on your channel too.  So!  Happy New Year Kandee!  And, it's great to finally say "hi!" Thanks for all your fun, awesome, and cool advice over the years!  I love your personality, and if we knew each other, we'd be friends in real life, I know it.
Holy plastic surgery batman! Haven't been here in a while but you look gorgeous xx
You always make me smile 😊
Around 7:12 - 7:15 on the left side of the screen, you've either got reflection or what looks like an anomalie or a spirit visitor?? 😀🤗 Happy New Year! 😊
Did anyone else notice the "orb" flying around at 7:10-7:15, immediately thought of Kandee's dad watching over her?
I wish I had a sparkling cider candle! I bought 12 shampoos and 23 conditioners of that scent! I love it so much. Happy 2018 kandee! ❤️
Love and Happy New Year! 💕💋
& congrats on everything hard work pays off 💄💄💋💋🌟🌟⭐⭐
Kandee, you are the sweetest, kindest soul. I’ve never met you but I feel your positive energy through the screen. Thank you for being you! I didn’t get to get your palette but I hope I can save for one before they’re gone. Cause they are my dream shades too!! Lots of love and lipstick!
Girl me too!! I had lost 16 lbs , then got hurt in my tail bone, so stopped exercising, but determined to get back on track. I wish I could do Keto,but I'm a vegetarian, and it's hard to do on a vegetarian diet!! Anyway looking forward to getting in shape with you Kandee!!
Kandee could you please review milkmakeup ily💕
Hippy Dippy! 😆❤️ Excited to see health related topics on your channel! My New Years resolution is lose some weight (original right?!) Love you (and the ogx sugar cookie hair care! Wish it was permanent 😩)
I absolutely love KVD eye liners!!!! And I love YOU, Kandee. I just wanna hang out with you and eat cupcakes :-D
Much Love Kandee!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ 
I was setting out my makeup 💄 like you would want us to...for my Kandee Class~~~and then my phone 📱 binged, as the Makeup and Happy Heart Jeanie appeared! 
Thank you for your continuous joyful, intelligent, positive and inspiring commitment to us for so many years....❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kindly and Joyfully~~~One of your “extended family members!”
Hugs and love from my house to yours!!!  Happy New Year!!!
May God Bless you every single day of the new year!!!
Lots of love,
Krista, AKA Mama Sparkle from Anchorage, AK 
PS. I am so exited that we will be moving back to Texas around summertime this year. It is an answer to my prayers as we will be so much closer to our families who we rarely get to see since being in Alaska is so far away!!!  Good things are coming in 2018!!!  Who knows, maybe I’ll get to meet you someday!?!?!  That sure would be special!!  You never know the big picture God has for all of us, but I know it is all for His good!!!
Lets power up 2018!!
After using the NYC smooth skin loose translucent powder i will never use a high end setting powder again 😆 it’s $7 and amazing!
💕😘 also the I want kandee eyeshadow palette is my most used eye palette ever since I got it I love it😁
Kandee you are amazing!!! I wish you an happy 2018 and excited for your finess videos, need to get in shape thks year!!! Love you!
You are such a positive and amazing person, thank you for giving tiny spark of hope that next year will be better than the past one. Trying to pick up the pieces of what is left from our lives after loosing our dad early this year, it’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever had to deal with and no one will really understand how much it hurts to loose a parent until it happens to you. 
Hope New Year will be great for you Kandee, kisses from Poland
God bless you Kandee!
I gotta say that my favorites for this year is your make-up collection and yout shampoo! I love the sparkling cider shampoo. You are the most beautiful and sweetest persons out there. Keep being you. And don't let the haters bring you down, because for every hater out there you have 10 fans that love you.
Candy gumdrop was my fave!
So excited to see what 2018 brings!!  Big hug 💙💚💜😙
Love you!❤️🎈😍

I live in Ga but one day I hope to meet you.  You are awesome.  Huge hugs from my house to yours.  Happy New Year to you and your family.  💗💗💗💗
Love you Kandee! Finally able to get your too faced shadow palette and so excited to use it! Hope you plan on making more palettes! Also got the shampoos n conditioners bc gumdrop smelled amazing!!!
Kandee you were and are my first favorite youtuber of all times! I hardly have time to see makeup tutorials anymore cause im a busy mom now but you will always be my favorite person! Never change i love you! God bless you and family
I love how encouraging you are and how much you love God you inspire me and my channel so much! I love you
My most used eyeshadow palette of the year was your Kandee eyeshadow palette.  It was also the palette I traveled with for business and when visiting family.  ❤️
I got my husband addicted to the Tarte Frixxion stick and it helps with his skin. I can always tell when he forgets to use it. I need to find a good pair of scissors for my eyebrows because I hate tweezing.
I love you kandee I just picked up all of your ogx shampoos and conditioners here in Vermont!
Haha that super sized powder puff totally gave me some pee wee herman show vibes too funny!
Didn't you do an ad for Better than Sex mascara? Maybe that should be disclosed? Love your work!
Hi cute lady!  Can you do a new video for mature makeup?  Please and thank you 💗💗💗
Loveeeee you so much kandee ♥️♥️♥️💕💕💕💕💕
The liptiful lady is going to be sad about this.
Sooo true about the #12 brush!!! My spooly broke off of it and I bought an elf dupe for a couple bucks. Nope. Wasted a couple bucks. Bought the 12.
What colors do you use in the Clinique foundation? I don’t live anywhere near a department store and we have similar skin tone.
I use your eyeshadow palette everyday too!! I just said to my husband that I think I should buy another because I am going to be so sad when it's gone!!! You are the best and most beautiful ever. I got the shampoos too and they are amazing!! Thank you for being an encouragement and so amazing :) 😘😘😘 Happy New Year!!!
Happy New Year Kandee! Here’s a computer hug from my house to yours! ❤️
Omg Kandee your video just cracks me up! The stuff about your eyebrows being so high cuz of your forehead to your “Oooh oooh D”- love! Happy New Years! Thank you for bringing mine in with a laugh!
I love your eye shadow palette so much!  It smells amazing so that's always a bonus.  But, for someone who almost never wore eye shadow in the past (only eyeliner & mascara), it's a life-changer, because it's so smooth & the colors blend so easily :) I always feel like a fancy person when I do my makeup with your palette. Hehe :)  ❤  Love you Kandee!  💚
My favorite of 2017 has been my I want kandee eye shadow pallette! I use it everyday. I started to hit pan on one of the colors, saddest day ever! Happy New Year!
OMG I’m so excited that you said your Too Faced range is coming to Mecca in Australia!!! I was so disappointed when I couldn’t get any of it but I’m super excited especially about the banana powder so I’m really hoping they bring the whole range out here. 💖💖💖💖
I feel it ended horrible! I live in PR and Maria destroyed everything. I hope 2018 is better.
You are the nicest person on youtube!!! Never change!
Kandee you are such a beautiful soul. I have watched your videos for like 6 years..and I haven't really been on YouTube in a while and I just got on and saw a video from you and am so happy I watched it. Happy new year!
Your hair 😍👑
You are an inspiration!! :)
Fullips Enhancer actually have their own website and they have a plumping floss that is A DREAM
I absolutely love your Eyeshadow Palette (my 1st ever Too Faced purchase), I have 2 Freshly Baked Matte Lipgloss's, Sparkling Cider shampoo, Gum Drop shampoo, and Frosted Sugar Cookie shampoo ( they all smell so delicious)! I just love your spirit, your personality, your makeup, your shampoos, I can't just help it! You are such an inspiration to me! I wish you and your family a very Blessed and Happy New Year 😘 Love ya😉
Kandee, I've been following you since the beginning.... I was 13 then, not knowing how to put on makeup, now I'm 22 and full glam everyday haha. I never comment, but I thought I'd take the time to thank you for not changing who you are after all these years, and for simply being you! Your energy is contagious! (Btw you haven't aged one bit... what kind of witchcraft products are you using??)
Hey Kandee, I am going to ULTA today with a $40 gift card. I'm looking to change up my make up look to fabulous. What products do you recommend that I get for prices under $40?
Kandee, you were my favourite this past year. Your happy shiny sparkly personality is infectious. I am not a very optimistic person, but watching your videos just reminds me to not be so sad about everything. So thank you!
My husband is so thankful for your sparkling cider shampoo and condtioner. Its his favorite scent, we buy cinnamon and spice candles year round. He nearly passed out in delight the first time I washed my hair in it. (I bought all the scents though! Frosted sugar cookie is my fave.)
I literally went to all different Walgreens in our area & I finally got my hands on the Shampoo & conditioner in all 3 scents- & OMG... me & my girls are in love with those shampoo & conditioners!!! You’re amazing ... have a Happy New year !!! 😘
I've seen all your videos, been subscribed for years. I've learned so much from you about makeup, life, being a mom. Your birth story videos helped me so much when I had my son. My makeup skills are on point because of you, and through all of it your the only YouTuber I still watch. Thank you for staying true to you and not just giving in to making a quick buck and constantly posting comercials. From the bottom of my heart thank you.
Your shampoos should sell year around we would buy them out. I gave them as christmas gifts.
I still need to try that shampoo!
+kandeejohnson  Back to black on the hair would be a good change for 2018.  Hair can become uncolorable after too many dye cycles - that's why +LilyJarlssonhome went back to her natural deep blond.  As a contingency for losing the acrylics, one color appropriate for a short-and-dark mani is KL Polish® in the new-for-2018 shade Cassiopeia (after the noblewoman of Greek myth), a deep gray shimmer.

Love you Kandee! I haven’t watched you in awhile (just too busy for YouTube) but watched you again. Made me smile!!!!

My face is so jacked up right now. I need all the skincare. ALL. OF. IT.

You don't understand I'm just like so happyyyyyy
Kandee, you don't know how many things you have posted on Snapchat I have screen shot because it really encouraged me and made my day! I want to wish you and your family the most BEAUTIFUL, HAPPY, HEALTHY, BLESSED and PROSPEROUS New Year! LOVE YOU xoxo

So ready for 2017 to be done it was the worst year of my life so far. Lost my grandma, aunt and uncle who I was all close too especially my grandma she was my second mom. I miss them so much. Only good thing that happened this year was my husband and I bought a house.
Love these videos of your favorites 💜! You’re the best! I’m getting married in April in Mexico! What long wearing full coverage foundation do you recommend that will last all day! I’m on the hunt!? Would the Clinique beyond perfection be a good one! Thanks, Kandee! 😘
My little boy loves your gumdrop shampoo ❤️ the purple one! We bought a few of them because they are limited even though we are usually a salon brand kinda house we couldn’t resist them
Love you Kandee Johnson 😍😍😍

KANDEE WE MISS UR VIDS!!!!
Me too Kandee Johnson, I'm starting my healthy new image in 2018..... I will be looking for ur upcoming videos.🏋️🏋️🏋️🚴🤸🤸
Kandee can you please do a video on what colors of blush/bronzer/eye shadows/lippies look good with different complexions??? I.e fair, light, bronze, medium, medium-deep, deep???? It would be the best if you had models!! Like amazing. Or at least just show what products and give examples of skin tones. Also maybe commonly loved colors for what skin tones but also out of the box colors that you wouldn't expect looking good
Love you Kandee! 💗
This is the happiest place on the internet Ily so much
I was one of the lucky ones that got the eyeshadow pallet from your line and i LOVE IT!!!   WEAR IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!!!Also got the banana powder and 2 lipsticks!!! AND the candy shampoo and conditioner!!!  I promise iam not a crazy stalker!!!😎
Happy New Year Kandee! I love your palette too. 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
You rule.
I LOVE that new YSL All Hours Foundation...I like to mix it with my NARS Sheer Glow and it lasts through the tropical humidity all day that I live in and stays perfected even after 12 hr wear!
Happy New Year Kandee! I’m in for getting into to best shape of my life this year! I am starting with the Tone it Up 5 day detox then they will have their love for love challenge (not dating! Just love everywhere) . You should check out the detox though it’s totally free and they have the workouts, nutrition plan recipes everything. Www.toneitup.com lol I don’t work for them but love the trainers and the community! 😘😘❤️ here’s to an amazing 2018!🍾
I love you Kandee. I've been watching your videos since you started on YouTube and I am so so happy and proud to see how far you've come. You deserve all the success in the world and you still remain so humble. You never let the "fame" get to your head. You will forever be one of my favorite people in the world. AND I love that you love God and aren't afraid to say so and give him credit. You're my freaking heart girl. I hope you come to Utah one day so I can meet you. 💜💙❤️
I use fullips  every day too even if I don't wear any makeup and over time it has made my lips plumper. To make them super plump I use it before putting on makeup and I can really see a difference.
Where us it ro i meant
2017 was actually a great year for me because my little girl was born 💕. She’s currently nursing/sleeping on me. I needed this year because the last two years before I dealt with losing my 40 year old brother to lung cancer, went through a ton with my health, and had a miscarriage. Ecclesiastes says there’s a time for everything, seasons come and go, be encouraged you won’t be in whatever season you’re in forever! Here’s to hoping 2018 is even better. We’re hoping to buy our first home 💕
Kandee what shade of dip brow do you use? Xoxo
Kandee - did you just say your palette was coming to Australia?!!!  I live in Aus  and have been watching your videos forever. Please say it’s true.
😍🤗😘
Love you Kandee!!
YOU SHOULD DO A CHRISTMAS HOUSE TOUR!!
You are awesome I've been watching you videos or 8 years. You taught me make up. Thank you!
I honestly don’t know why I haven’t been subscribed to you channel!!! I love you collaboration with Too Faced!!! Then I realized that I haven’t seen a YouTube video from you in forever and come to find out that some of my subscriptions were deleted. What the heck ?!? I fixed that ASAP. Starting off 2018 with your videos that I missed. Thank you for being so much fun to watch and I’m wishing you a happy & healthy new year.
❤️

Happy new years
I love my kandie pallet
Love your hair color!
I love your eyeshadow palette! When I saw it at ulta I grabbed it without even trying it lol. Soon as I got home OMG 😳 the feel of them when swatched, the pigmentation, the fact you can make so many different looks ugh so wonderful!! I use it everyday, no matter if I’m going for a day or night look. Soon as I get paid Friday I’m going to order another from ulta so I know I have plenty. I hope you come out with different palettes in the future. Love u :)
I'm with ya
love you very much from chile!!!!!!!
Kandee happy new year
I sure hope I get that rainbow of happiness!! My childish past has finally caught up with me..I have to spend 30 days in the county jail from a DUI that happened a while back (I'm a new person since this occurred thank God!!) I have to be away from my two year old for A MONTH. OH! I'm also Pregnant. Which I'm grateful for but jail--pregnancy, it's gonna suck. That's how my 2018 is starting out :( but when I get home in Feb it's A NEW LEAF! HAPPY NEW YEAR BABY!!!!! 😘😘
I love you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Happy new year!
I am so with you on getting healthy this year!! I've let myself go for a few years and it's time to get back into shape!! HAHAHA I have a big forehead to and I do the same thing with my eyebrows! LOL
But it seems like you eat pretty healthy already? I know you choose gluten free options for your health and stuff. I will definitely join you on a health journey.....lord knows I need to eat healthier!
im glad  to see u in a black hair kandeeeeee
Happy New Year Kandee! I want to thank you for your infectious joy AND for your OGX Sugar Cookie Shampoo and Conditioner! I thought I was moisturizing my lavender hair sufficiently with hair masks and then I tried your set. My hair hasn't felt this soft and smooth IN YEARS. OGX, if you're reading, please keep this in your line forever please!!!
I’m so glad that you’ve had such huge success this year! I’m sure 2018 will be amazing for you! Love your videos and makeup! I bought some this year and it’s fabulous..... big hugs to you!
Happy New Year honey xoxo
Miss Kandee pretty girl...can you recommend a yoga person that I can watch that has beginners videos? I mean SUPER beginner b/c I have never done yoga before....lol. And another question, probably a dumb question but an honest one. How does or does yoga make or help you lose weight and if so, how? Thank you...I loves you! xoxoxo  P.S. You have worn the MAC Cherry lipliner since you started your channel, I know that for a fact b/c I've watched since your first brush washing video!!!!! :)
I kinda think it’s better to have a few close shades of foundations I have to use 3 shades of Tarte Amazonian clay foundation & it cosmetics cc cream to get it just right & it’s for reasons like I frequent my tanning salon, I live in South Florida, my complexion is complicated, etc etc. After awhile of getting the knack of it I feel like my foundation is more on point than ever!
Happy New Year Kandee!!
Great video and Happy New Year Kandee
love you, love you, love you Kandee!!
Kandi if you like the tarte charcoal stick you would love the same thing from Yes . The brand with vegetables on it . You can find it st Ulta ! It’s amazing I use it everyday too and I’m a skin care crazy girl !!
I’ve always loved your eyebrows, Kandee! If I could look like anyone in the world, it would be you!!! You’re features are absolutely PERFECT, just like God made you to be. 💕😘
❤❤❤❤❤🎥
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
I saw all flavors of your shampoos and conditioners at Bed Bath and Beyond today so check there people!!!!
Hi kandee! :) hope you’re well!
what brush does she uses for her blush????
Happy New Year Kandee
Have a very Happy New Year Kandee!
Kandee your awesome I love you and your videos I love your hair
When did you dye your hair blue?
Happy New Year’s Eve Eve!
💗 Happy New Year Kandee!
♥♥♥♥
You forgot to list the eyebrow brush & gel!! Anastasia right? What was the shade?!
Kandee: I'm trying to find the Video of your birthday 2017 when your mom purchased those kick-butt turquoise earrings, and your guys went to a restaurant with a cotton candy topper on some dish you had.  I want to take my mom there but I can't find what restaurant it was!  She is visiting June 14 from Maryland.  Help, pretty please :)
Love you Kandee!! Not sure if you'll see this since I know you get so many comments but wanted to point out something I saw in your video. At the 7:10-7:14 mark i saw what looked like an orb come from behind the left side of your head and float around i even had to pause and go back cus i thought maybe you had some sort of filter on but no filter. Maybe someone special is watching over you :) I know a lot of people don't believe in that kind of stuff but i do. Hope you have a wonderful and safe new year Kandee and may you have so many big and beautiful things ahead for you in the new year!
Happy New Year love!!!
I would rather get lip injections!!! 😂😂💖💋
Kandee you always give me hope ❤️⚓️
Kandee you always give me hope ❤️⚓️
Love it
How about new brows?
I’m starting yoga and eating better. I’m 47 and i need to start taking better care!!
Shes to cute
are your roots your natural color?! i didn’t know your hair was sooo dark!
Kandee could you do a video advising how a person can stop dying their hair and go to their natural color if the natural hair is a different color than the dyed color - for me it's dyed brown and my natural is now grey, lol.  I am thinking someone who went from blonde to dark or dark to blonde would have that same problem.
Yasss kandee
Kandee, you're a mom and post-babies, your body is amazing! I cant imagine you morphing!!
Kandee, did you already try the fenty beauty foundation from rihanna?
Great video
Almost 4 million subs!!!
Where did you get that huge puff ? ?????????
I know you keep yours and michaels relationship private now but it would be awesome if you became officially a Castro this year! 👰 🎩❤️💒
Thumbs up!
cool
Love you Kandee!!!!! Big hugs 👄👄💄💄
Kandee you should just say that instead of having a forehead, you have a "fivehead." You don't BTW, you're fine and everyone else, I apologize for the corny joke..Happy New Year to all! 🌠
Anyone else watch the whole commercial even when you can skip ad because you like Kandee enough to let her get paid for the annoying adds?
Thank you for what you said at the beginning of your video. I have been suffering with some depression and your words meant the world to me.  Life is hard and it is so easy to just let the depression take over, but you have to fight and get our there and do things you normally do in life.  God bless and happy New Year!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯💯💯🎊🎊
Hi Kandee, Happy New Year:) love your channel, I’m Yana😀I’m on a “thebestshapeofmylife” thing as well. Are you considering exercising or dieting? I’ve started Keto diet dietdoctor.com(not sponsored )here, and this gave me crazy results. I got -6kg(12lbs) in a month eating bacon and whipped cream😆I got of the track few times with holidays but so far I adore it. Even found channel on YouTube with Keto chocolate, bread and etc. I’m mom of 2 and trying to do YouTube in between feedings, so max for what I have time in a day it’s few planks 😄. Before I’ve digged into this Keto thing I’ve tried eating small portions in every 3 hours, and to not eat 4hours before bed and exercising daily at home, but with Breastfeeding I’m such a food processing machine that small portions doesn’t work know😄 What’s yours plan ?
Love you Darlin💋SO proud of you!!
Has anyone else noticed how much Kandee's voice sounds like Gwen Sefani?
I’m so so so excited for your show!!!!!
I love ur voice
Sending you loving energy and many blessings
You've got orbs in your video how cool  xx
i suffer from chronic pain (severe arthritis) 
iRecently, i've started to watch one of your videos every morning, because you make it easier to take on the day.  

Thank you, Kandee.... you're an angel on earth.
U remind me so much of Cindy lauper😋 I love it!
Hey Kandee😍😍😍. How does one choose the correct color for Laura Mercier translucent powder. I’m see #1 and #2. #3 is way too dark for me!
I love laura mercier powder but try Charlotte Tilbury airbrush finish trust me its amazing be a t Laura Mercier for me xxx
You're so inspirational! I loved your sparkling cider shampoo!!!! So glad I got my hands on some at Walgreens!
Why so rushed?? Breathe girl!
Thank you!!
I don't know where you get your energy from, especially being a mom of 4!!! I only have 2 and I don't have nearly as much pep in my step as you.  You're inspiring!  Keep going, girl!!!
Can’t believe I’ve been watching you since 2008 maybe even before that I love you Kandee
Do you like country music? Do you want kids? Do you only speak and understand English?
You have kids 😮
Love you kandee!!!!
HAppy new year my dear!!!! XOXO Sharon
I just want you to know that YOU are a pure hearted honest and awesome artist! I hands down watch your tutorials over anyone else's and I do makeup myself. 💋🍭🍬✌🏻🌈XoXo ps - I love hippie dippie scents too lol
I’d love to have your too faced pallet. These shampoos and conditioners I’ve purchased during the holidays
Love love love her <3
Why is her voice so familiar sounding?
Kandee... did you notice the weird floating thing at 7:10? It looks like a spirit floating by your right shoulder! Did you have any candles or anything??
Can you please send me that foundation and that powder I donor live near a Nordstrom?
She should do voice acting!
You wanna know something Kandee. I was really into your videos, I watched them every time you posted. Now you just lost a subscriber. Logan Paul is amazing. Yes, he made a big mistake and that video should have never been posted. He's only human and other people has videoed seeing dead bodies in the suicide forest. At least he had the decency to blur out the face. I love Logan and I will support him through anything that he has battles with. Everyone including you are being very childish and are acting so stupid over a mistake a HUMAN has made. You're a human yourself. What if you done something like that in your life. You wouldn't want to be humiliated in the whole world. Everyone who has disrespected him should really be ashamed of yourselves. I love you Logan. I will forever be in the Logang! ✌@Logan Paul
You make it look so easy! I definitely want to try these out :)
You're SO beautiful! xo
When you look down tho 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩 I can’t do it captain
I love the idea of full magnetized strip lashes, but those ...when you look down you can see they are not placed right or not flexible enough.. You can see them for sure.
But those inner corners though...
Looks pretty bad when you look down though.
They do not look right when you look down at all it looks weird ☹️
DON'T LIKE HOW THE STRIP DOESN'T LAY CLOSE TO BASE OF LASHES.....LAYS STRAIGHT!
I honestly don't like these lashes. when you look down they look so bad and off set.
Girl I love you and has been a follower for years, but I complete disagree with you on this one, if you look closely the corners are all loose and not close to the lash line they look more fake than the regular ones at-least with glue you make them stick close to your lash line and not looking like if they are about to fall of your lashes, if I could tell from a video I imagine it would look a lot worst in person. This is just pure sponsorship. Smh.
11:25.. the lash is not even on her lash line
It looks so good up front but when u close your eyes u can see that it’s flat and that it sticks out from your lid... looks so bad.. nothing against u kandee I’m just not feeling the magnetic eyelashes..
Can you try the Ardell magnetic lashes when they come out?
Lashes look easy to apply and beautiful once on.. only problem is when you look down they dont look connected to your lash line properly, is there any way to make them more adaptable?
My gosh how do you not poke yourself in the eye with those nails 😂😂
Is there anyway to make them adapt more to your eye? Like when you look down, the ends aren't really connected to your lash line? Hoping to save up because these look awesome!
I can't get your video of trying different types of lashes to load. Also can you try the Ardel magnetic lashes too?
when you look down we can see the line though😏
I read Magneto instead of magnetic in the title lol! Any X-Men fans up here?? 

On another note, looking gorgeous as always Kandee! 😍
11:00 it looks so wrong.. 😓
You so cute Kandee!
these look great when your eyes are open, but i can't handle how they look when looking down 😬😬
looks like they don't hook close enough to the lash line 😖
Kandee, please please please tell me where you got that earring bar.
WOW!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH. I BOUGHT THEM LAST MONTH AND I COULDN'T PLACE THEM, SO I TREW THEM  IN THE GARBAGE, NOW I KNOW HOW TO DO IT THANK YOU 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍👍
lol the thumbnail OMG I though your nails were your eyeballs.......... 😳😳😳😳  #cantbeunseen
Loving your candy cane glasses!!😉 Love you, Kandee!!❤️😘🍭 
#SnapFam👓
It looks fine until you close your eyes. I'll stick with glue.
I just adore you! You seem like you have the best hearts out there. And I loved your candy cane glasses!
Did you notice that the eyelashes were not sitting on your eyes when you reviewed your video?
11:55 the corners are not sticking. maybe just go with the bold ones haha
Ardell  has magnetic lashes too and for much less :-) Did you try them? xx
Edges are falling off.. nice😀
I like your candy cane glasses, love!!
I bought your banana powder just so I could have something kandeed ... I’ve been watching you for over 9 years now... love you ❤️⚓️
Your cheek bones are so high they are almost touching Saturn. Beautiful.
I have these and have been struggling!! Thanks so much!
This is the best video I've seen about magnetic lashes! Thank you! #subscribed !
As always thank you for making me smile and never straying who you are 😀❤🙏
I hope you've finally have caught up on sleep! 😴😴😴
Love you, Kandee!!
THANK YOU! So helpful I was buying cheap kinds and had no idea what I was doing 😂 also you’re perfect ! 💕
Loved the video!!well done!
My mom wears these, they're great for adding some volume..until she looks down. I think they would really improve the lashes if they added more curvature to the band! They just stick right out otherwise 🙄
I have some too.
Wanna try it soon.
Your so beautiful !!!
Your face , your eyes ! 😎🤗
Thank you for your Tipps !!!
I think the biggest problem people have with traditional strip lashes is getting the corners to stick down/ getting them close to lash line... and these are not the answer lol these would be good if that doesn't bother you and you want something quick? 
I don't know, my advice would be if lashes are too difficult just stick to copious amounts of mascara haha
Kandy Kane glasses are super cute! Love the video, thanks for being out tester! I've always wanted to try them but wasn't sure they would work!
I wish I had those glasses 😘 you are my favorite person!! I’ve been watching for so many years..you just keep getting better!
You re so beautiful i can't handle it 😭
I got 2 sets of these after watching your review and I love them!  Thank you!
I love magnetic lashes I uses 30 second lashes. 🤗
I would have liked to see a tutorial without your eyeliner wings. I found it hard trying separate the wings and the eyelashes when trying to visualize what it would look like on me.
I'm so glad that you did this video and found magnetic lashes that were realistic (looking and actually worked)
Since watching you show how to put these on, I'm so going to buy these now. 
Thank you and Merry Christmas to you and your family
I wanna try these!! I feel like they would be easier for beginners with lashes aka me😂
Kandee, I just love your vibe.. you're so genuine and talented! Hugs & love... thanks for the tutorial!
Love the candy cane glasses #snapbabes I'm bdukes713 on there. 😉

You're so funny, love your videos and snaps. Lashes look great. Keep up the good work. 💝
SOME STEALYOMAN LASH REALNESS!
It helped a lot as I've seen all the failed ones so I thought they didn't make any that exactly worked and look so good on you. Thanks Kandee we can always count on you <3 Merry Christmas to you and yours  xoxo
Thanks so much for sharing.  You make it look so easy.  I have an eye problem so I don't have many lashes and my eyelid is scarred from a lot of surgeries.  I'm looking forward to trying these!
I love your candy cane glasses, 😣😣😣 aannndddd pleeasseeee 🙏🙏🙏 have ogx make that Sparkling Cider candle available for us alll
I NEEEED to try these!!!

XOXO
What about the Ardell one?
Kandee cane glasses are so adorable on you! Sending love, positivity & huge hugs🤗 to you from Indiana Kandee! Merry Christmas to you & yours!  💯🎅🏼🌺🎁🎄
Beautiful & Thanks For The Tutorial!
🎄☃️Merry Christmas ☃️🎄 and 💃🏼🎊Happy New Year🎊💃🏼 to ALL 🤘🏻🍸💃🏼💖😜
Gr8  vid,  thank you!
U look literally just as good without any makeup or hair done WHAT?! NO FAIR
These eyelashes look amazing!
This video is finally out haha I seen the video on Snapchat
Thank you! I got two full sets from somewhere else and I had a hard time to put them on. Thank you for the video. It helped! I will check out the one you recommended too.
Get it girly! I'm also so pumped and want to say thank you! I had a fan send my a pic of you with a look you created and if I world do it too. They love you too, they just want to see me do it as well. To be asked to do that, I almost cried, BUT IT'S KANDEE! she did it already 🤯😍Thank you for inspiring my fans (our) as well as inspiring me 💋 stay awesome!
I love you!!! I bought the 3.00 lashes on ebay... and they sucked... OMG !!! I'm buying the good ones thanks so much for this video...
Love you Kandee ❤️
Those r so cool!!! Feel free 2 send Erica any extras!!! 😁😊❤
32 seconds is all it to for me to subscribe, lol!   You're amazing!
OMG that applicator is magic.  Although, I feel that magnets near the eyes can't be good for you.  xx
You're so preettttyyyyy!!!💕
MERRY CHRISTMAS KANDEE ⛄❄🎁🎄❤🎅
I'm so HAPPY your posting more because your videos make me smile and because your a beautiful woman with a BEAUTIFUL soul!!
omg so weird watching you after meeting you in person! like how are you a real person?!?
none of them were on the lash line....
This is awesome! I am allergic to the liquid glues needed to apply the lashes, so this is so helpful!
2018 and the discount code is still valid! Thank you Kandee💖💖💖💖💖
I've been wondering about magnetic lashes because I am hypersensitive to everything. Thank you for pointing out the best ones. I had been looking at some and the magnets were all over the place and rather large that I worried it would bother my eyes.  So hopefully I can save some $$ and get these to try out.
BTW, what lip color and brand are you wearing? It's gorgeous!
I loved your candy cane glasses 👓 I love all of your videos too. You’re a true role model 💕💕
I'm a little confused... they were 59.99 and now they are 69.99 but they are giving a 10 coupon? ... I'm calling bullshit... I don't like that... unethical if you ask me.
$60 or $70??? ...for lashes??? lol ...hell, i'll just spend 99c and make my own! hehe
You are so totally cool!!!  These seem so cool too.  What do they stick to?  I mean the magnet?  Must be magic!!
Omg mama Kandee I love your haircolor~!✨💙😍
I'm in love with your palette. ❤❤❤
yaaas finally somebody who understands why I love semilashes so much! They are just so much more comfortable and these magnetic ones look amazing <3
Your candy cane glasses are amaaaaaze, not as amaze as you though 😉💖 lots of love from your little Aussie gal xoxoxox
Ordered mine tonight can't wait to try them out.  Thank you for doing all the research, I have been wanting to try the magnetic eyelashes and didn't know where to start.  Thank you so much for the code as well.  I am now one of your subscribers :)
First time I hear about magnetic eyelashes xD
When I clicked on the link of you trying different lashes it said "sorry there are no videos"! Thank you for your helpful video!
I've been waiting to see a review on these lol
Yees i love these
Host, teacher, and friend! Omg I'm so happy you're on YouTube. Your videos bring me much joy thanks Kandee!! 💋
I've been researching 1/2 and not finding any information about how magnetic eyelashes can or would  affect your vision or anything else
LASHES ARE LIFE 🙌🏼!! Love this video, thanks for sharing!!!
Your candy cane glasses are so cute 😍
I hate to sound negative. But I tried this method...and thank you for the tips. But I swear this takes longer than just applying glue to strip. 😫
I think, I actually prefer this color hair on you... 🙂💙
thanks for trying all the lashes and finding the best ones, I have been wanting to try them but didn' t know which ones to get and would they work or look good so you have solved that problem.....
I really admire how upbeat and postive you always are is so refreshing 💜
this girl will be really beautiful is she removes all the artificial stuff on her...
Those candy cane glasses tho!😍
Applying the lashes starts at about 4m30. Wish I knew before! To much talking for me 😥
Definitely going to try these, I just purchased your frosted sugar cookie conditioner and got your melted ice cream lipstick.. Both smell amazing and are wonderful!!
The full lash looks like the inner corners are lifting. How do you fix that so it doesn't look like they are falling off your eye?
i wish i could wear lashes but i already have ‘daddy long legs’ naturally..but the magnetics look so fun☺️
sending you lots of VIRTUAL HUGS!!! We and the younger generation definitely need your FULL OF KINDNESS, LOVE VIDEOS!!!
You have such a beautiful soul and it always shines through. 💗 i watched your video on getting through grief and it helped me so much, i lost my dad as well. Much love Kandee, stay sweet ♥️♥️♥️
I've never been able to wear false lashes because of allergies, so I'm looking forward to trying them some day. Thanks Kandee! Merry Christmas to you & your family 💖🎄✨🙏🏻😍
My fav beauty influencer can I ask what blue hair dye you use as that is stunning and bright... and what do you have on your eyes your make up never disappoints me always stunning xxx
A fad, I don’t see them having much longevity.
Everytime I blink they fall off
"to be on the youtube...internet" hahahaha Love you Kandee!!!! <3 <3
Magnetic Lash: Did you just assume my gender?
Thank you however,  magnets that close to your eyes are OK?  Hmm.....plus the ends stick out.
Do you have a tutorial on your eye liner because it's beautiful and I would love to see how you do it.  All I have are fails.....lol
You should try doing your full face with Mary Kay makeup
Totally diggin the candy cane glasses! #SnapBabes!
Super, Kands! Thanks! 🤗
$70? Don’t think so
You remind me of Gwen Stefani. Haha
I have been waiting for this😊
You’re so great at demos!  I ordered the half ones.
Looks cool she explained it perfectly but still not a fan of those lol but good work kandee 😊💜
HI KANDEE HOW CAN I GET SOME OF THOSE MAGNETIC APPLICATOR FOR THE LASHES? THANKS 
GRACE  I LUV UR HAIR
U make it look so easy!!!
o watch you on glo'zeil
I am glad I watched this video. Because I got my daughters the ones from Walmart and they thought I was crazy lol now I know we're to get the best one thank you
Love the lashes. I never have worn fake lashes. Thank you so much for sharing!! Love seeing you back on you tube.
Love the video. Can you share who the BAD BOY - ( applicator ) you mentioned on the video.  I searched and could not find it.
😍 Love you!
I cant wait for the Ardell magnetic lashes to come out to try affordable magnetic lashes. They look pretty nice and the price is just right. These ones are too pricey for me :-/
Kandee girl...you are awesome! I've been watching your videos for years. Love ya much! Stay blessed! 😘
i do not thing she is doing it right
Love your hair!!! Xx
This video was so so helpful thank you!!!
Your eyes are GORGEOUS!!!!
9:41
Looks great.  BTW...what lipstick are you wearing?  I love the color.
Merry Christmas Kandee!!!
The team of www.beautyshopbygoldenyaa.com love your video!
Hi Kandee Love u bunches! I want to try these magnetic eyelashes thanks for doing a review on them.  Actually I like both the bold wing lash and the full lash on you. They both look nice! Happy Holidays to u and your family Kandee🎄🎅💖😚
Omg snap chat famalam! How much do u look like it mama x 😍
You are beautiful with or without makeup, inside and out
I can't do it! I'm struggling
love this haircolor
THIS IS SOOOOO HARD
I want these so bad! Omg I am saving,lol! Seen them tou made it loom way better though! No glue im for it!
I love those lashes.
I must try these!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Merry Christmas Kandee!!! Hope you have enjoyed some of your amazing hot chocolate!! :D
I can't wait to get these!!!! I've always had problems with normal lashes/glue. I LOVE that they have that easy applicator, sooo many other reasons to opt for these. Thanks for the tips lovey!!! 😊💖
You should totally try the new full coverage ones they recently launched. Much more difficult to apply but super nice!
You are so cute I love you !! Beauty!! New subscriber !! Hey girl hey
ummmm 11:00 that doesn't look good at all. sorry this is a big no no for me
I really needed this.  I bough a pair on Amazon. Kind of hard. But love that I don't cry like when I use glue.
Omg I love you kandee...I love your vids
I don't use makeup and I am so shocked. Wtf is that eyelash curl-thing?? It looks like a torture device
4:28 
Hope that helps 😉
You look and sound like Gwen Stefani.
I bought some after I saw your video and they came without an applicator, yikes!  I’m having a hard time putting them on so I’m watching your video over and over. 🤣
I found them to be too heavy because it felt like my eyelids were getting a workout.
Nope I tried them...& they do not stay close to ur lash line. The full strips are awful..but the half strips for the outside edge work great
They look great, but I personally find any kind of false lashes so fiddly to apply  and I'm not patient
Honestly it bothers me you still do your makeup like its 2014.... Its hard to find your makeup looks relatable to the more modern looks I want to achive. Just being honest
Love your ear cuff!
Happy holidays and merry Christmas kandee. xxx
This is so cool! I only wonder how these would do with contact lens wearers?!  Magnets are safe for eyes right?? Love you Kandee!!
Hi Kandee thank you so much for sharing! This is a great option and no glue! Can't wait to try these and share them on my channel.BTW love your hair color!!  Merry Christmas!! 🎄🎁❤
Thanks for this video you save me haha, I just bought magnetic eyelashes, I have never use false lashes because I’m allergic to glue. Now I know how to put them correctly cause I was struggling so much 😞😂
Your nails 😍
Kandee the chameleon!  I've watched your videos forever and evah and love them!  You are one of if not THE pioneer makeup guru's that I know of and I trust 200%!
Would love your thoughts on the magnetic lashes ardell came out with
Kandee, please do not take offence from my post, I know you appreciate honesty, and it is not any hate, but you look so much better without make up; the style you do on yourself makes you look old :( Please stop , you are a beautiful, joyful, s strong woman. Also the huge, thick, pointed nails look like a scenic claw instead of a nice manicure. Please, get back to being more natural, beautiful.. As to the magnetic eyelashes alone - I am not a fan, for the they do look artificial, especially once eyelid is closed - you can see a straight line away from the lash line. But - this is a choice for everyone too. You do your best for people to feel more acquainted with it so that they could make uo their own choices too and have it easier. You are an amazing warm person and give strength, joy and inspiration to many people here on Youtube and surely in life too. Stay beautiful in and out ! Have an awesome day !
Ardell do magnetic eyelashes now! Please try them for us? 😁 xoxo
Kandee When I say I Love you ... I am 100 straight, NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE OKAY
Anyway I really Love ya and need your professional opinion....
Where can l get the wider tweezers to apply the magnetic lashes?? Please
I loveeeeee youuuuu soooooo muchhhhhh 🍭Kandee 🍭
Def not a fan of the strip lashes.  When you look down, it's obvious you have on false lashes.  I like your outer edges the best
this looks like torture
Can't do it too!
love your candy cane glasses🍭😊
Your teeth are perfect♡
I have the magnetic eyelashes but no eyelash curl :(
Great video! Can you test out the new ardell magnetic lashes?
Wow no makeup! You look stunning! You definitely don't need makeup!
I love the accent that came out in the end ..lol 😉😙
Did you try the urban lash?
❤️ your candy cane glasses! ❤️
great video. But when you look down those eyelashes do not fit against your lid. but you make it look good but watch your own video thank you.
The link for the "testing all magnetic lashes" something something is not there
Thanks for your help Kandee!! I find them super tricky.
Have you tried the ones Ardell came out with?
Kandee, I love your name and your personality! I've watched you for years.💝 I wrestled with Ardell magnetics all evening to no avail.😞 maybe I'll give it a shot tomorrow...however,  I'm wondering What your opinion is  about eyelash dying and also perming. It's a big trend here in the big D. Seems a lot a shops are pushing this. however, I'm just not really sure.  Thank you so much! You are the best!
looks wonderful
Hi Kandee, I am wondering if you are going to keep posting videos on YouTube more often. I don’t have Instagram and it looks like you post more videos there. I would appreciate more videos on YouTube being that is where I first started watching you and got to know you. I subscribed to you the very first video I watched your words of wisdom have always touched my heart so I am hoping you keep posting to YouTube. Thank you and Happy Holidays 🎄🎄🎄
You are so funny😂
Kandeeee😊 can you do a new house tour? I love you!💖💖
Is that your real hair?
Yes the first lashes are definitely way better! But you could cover your entire face in eyelashes and still look amazing.
I love that lip color too, what is that?, thanks soooo nice to see how you applied them😘
Kandee,   indeed  looks easy to apply the lashes.  You are soooo   GOOD at showing us hoe to do it.   You have a new believer.  Thank you!!
Wow thats nice!  ♡.♡
Omg, over 4 minutes & u still haven’t shown us how to apply !!
But... there are also many MANY different types of eye's.. This may be good and convenient to you but not for everybody. There is no product on this planet that will please everybody..
Magnetic eyelashes?   The future is here....or maybe I'm just out of the loop when it comes to pop culture.
ok, I really love the way these look but I tried two different times and my eyes water so bad, my nose starts running and I can't see well because of the extra water that is flushing out of my eyes. Anyone else have the same problem?  I must be allergic to the magnets??
This is freaking amazing !!!! I worked for one two lashes at Del Amo Mall Torrance,Ca  and I told them to reach out to YouTube!!!!!! Too bad too sad they fired me short after but I see they held on to my idea😒 .. I should reach out to them and ask for my job back since I have such great networking ideas! RJ and Katie where are you? 🤔 Hit me up, I also would like a raise, thanks
I was watching this video to see how you put them on you only talked about them I hope in a different video you're actually showing how to put them on I had eyelashes put on twice not too long ago the first lady I went to a nail salon where I do my nails poke me my ice cream loud and my eye was completely red for a week I let a different lady do it and she kind of pinched it didn't hurt as much but still hurt so I don't want anyone to tell my eyelashes anymore I'd rather do it myself so I think the magnetic I will be the perfect kind by not sure how to put it on
Thank you Kandee, was wondering which magnetic lashes to try. I do have a question, been using tight eye and tight neck for several months, they don’t seem to work as well as they did in the beginning, and the fact that both products are 1.1oz, eyes and neck, we know we use much more product for the neck. My question is, can you apply these products for us, the way they should be applied so that they work? I did contact the company and they advised me to refrigerate the products. I did just that but still no success. I was promised that these areas will improve over time, that also has not happened for me. I hope you can give me some of your sage advice. Many blessings and Happy Holidays to your precious self and your family, love Leila
Thank God I found you.
I definitely need to try these , maybe one day because I can’t afford it but totally willing to try them out because I’m allergic to latex & most of the time allergic to any type of lash glue so I need to give this a go,😊
any small youtubers wanna be friends and support each other?💛
I bet that OGX candle smells out of this world!!
You make all look so simply on my list to try bought previous Ebay and absolutely useless. ❤️❤️❤️💋
your the best thanks...
When she looked down you could see there was a lot of space between her lash line and the actually lash😂
What does the magnet go too?
What's it magnet too?
Kandee I just posted a similar video so if anyone wants to see any other magnetic lashes you can peep mine too! Loved your tips as always!
How about to cut the end to fit the eye? Is it possible?
You list a number of different reasons as to why someone might wear these but could someone suffering from Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) use them or do they use your natural lash to stay in place?
Hi Kandee, I saw that the magnetic lashes (full size) didn't touch the lash line.  Is there a way to make sure they stay close to the lash line (so they don't look fake)?
I wanna try these now.
When you look straight ahead they look more normal but when you look down it looks like the lashes are just lying on top of your own and it looks odd definitely not normal, good video.
You Look Good with or without makeup!!!!
You remind me of Claire Dunphy from Modern Family for some reason!
Will definitely check them out. Looks so easy to apply !!!
What lip color are you wearing, I need it!!!!
$59 😳
Where did you get your bar earring? I love it so much!! Also, did you try the original lash from one two. I am trying to figure out which ones to buy.
If you close your eyes you can see the lashes are barely hanging on. I'm not invested $60 in something I can't wear for at least 8hrs.
u can put your false with the long nail !! bravo !! :D
When my lashes arrived they were all over the place and I could tell something was wrong.  There customer service is Outstanding   my order was replaced at no cost to me.  The lashes are very pretty and the company is a great
Great tips! I liked the rounding thing that looks like shoe-shining that you do before putting them on. I’ve got a couple of pairs of One-Two but I never wear them because they feel like stiff shelves or something. I also NEVER thought to curl my lashes before (duh, and another fine tip). And finally, blending your regular lashes w/ One-Two lashes w/ some more mascara. Perfect! 3 things that will make an enormous difference! Thanks!
Love you hair and lipstick. What color is on your lips? Thanks for the tips.
When you look down you can they aren’t on right.
Eeeek, the applicator gives me the eeebie geebies, I don’t think I could do that. I almost couldn’t look lol it looks so pretty though. I’ve never used any type of false lash, it’s like a phobia of mine or something 😂
❤❤❤
"because i'm not afraid, to be on the you-tube, internet, without any makeup on." AHAHAHHA
Kandee I only found your channel because of Lilly and now I'm hooked! The first video I watch was the one with you and your daughter when she was trying to apply that white makeup all over your face. That was too funny! Your bubbly personality is infectious. I love watching your videos eventhough I suck at applying makeup.
Waoo so easy, I was crazy trying to put the eyelashes and then I give up. Now I will try this way
wow i was waiting for you to demonstrate those lashes bcuz i was iffy on the whole thing, the other type of lashes with the glue never works for me, and i am allergic, so i was like "um how can i look as amazing as the beauty-tubers"? wow i think so worth it!!! thankx kandee!!
4:35
Where can i buy the applicator in the UK please?
Have you tried Ardell wispies?
Those are bad extensions. But cute tho!
I use them as well.  Let me say they are so easy to put on.  I wear glasses and even without my glasses they are super easy to put on
You need some glue.
omg i can't wait to try these
Your candy cane glasses are adorable!!!! You're adorable as well!
I love you soooo much
How can you do that with those nails!?
tati did a review on the day u did or close to it and i wanted to comment her to watch ur video, but i didn't want to sound offensive. lol
Honestly the stupid eyelash glue NEVER works because my eyes do not curve the way the lashes do. I always set the glue. I’ve tried fingers, fancy eyelash tweezers, eyebrow tweezers...anything that could pinch. I’ve tried trimming them, precurling them.. all the things. Honestly, I think even a pro would have a hard time getting lashes to work with my eyes.
Candy can you plies tell me a brand or name of magnetic lashes that are not heavy plies I feel like I am carrying rocks on my eyes I have the ardell magnetic  lashes
When you look down, the lashes are just barely hanging on! Especially on the inside part of your eye. You act like they’re not very comfortable on you either. Come on.... come clean!
But when you look down, they are never close to the lash line, tho. They look a bit weird.
Being honest they look a bit heavy and fake on you, you should show us up close by looking down and on the sides.
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks Kandee, love you!!!  I have a problem with mascara, I always have to put my mascara on before any  eye makeup as it always rubs off on my eye lid and below.  Any suggestions as I see you always put your mascara on last?  Keep up the amazing work!  Big Hugs
That was a great lesson !
Mine look like big brick on the side of my eyelashes I’ve tried to spread the out but they look strange and don’t match my own eyelashes
Where can I buy the applicator tool put both lashes on at the same time?
Love your hair ❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖💖
I’ve never used any lash stuff besides mascara. These look so scary, omg.
Where did you get that earring bar thing? It's so cute!!
what lipstick color is that? omg it's beautiful ;)
Ficou muito bom. Que ideia boa esses cilios magnéticos.
When you look down it does not look right at all,It doesn’t look good
u love talking with your hands... its annoying
This might work for me because I have no clue on how to wear fake lashes!!
I couldn't take this seriously when I saw them inner and outer corner lashes looking like they were gonna fall off.. Girl no... who you playing tho...
You saved someone’s life today! I’m so pregnant and hormonal and these were pissing me off! I was about to go crazy on someone! Trying to get ready for the marine corps ball was frustrating me! You’re the best!
It’s literally falling off your eye when you look down.
Hi Kandee I was wondering do u give private makeup lessons?
i hate how im finally tryna be a pro at glue lashes n now magnetic ones come out :( which sound easy
girl I'm sorry but its not on at all lol
I bought my first pair tonight..... left them with my mom but I’m gonna try them soon! Soooooo excited!
Compare those to wearing mascara and the price of them, it’s not worth it
I disagree that full sets look less realistic than half sets. lashes grow across the entire lid line, so putting falsies only at the corners is a dead giveaway they are fake. The problem is with the quality of the lash and their being too full-in a way that no one's lashes has ever grown. The most unrealistic thing with false lashes is the idea that the top lash has hair and the bottom doesn't! Huge lashes on the top and then next to nothing on the bottom looks idiotic...As for the brand you tried, the strip lashes look awful. They are not contoured to the lash line. It seems as though there are too many magnets to line up. It would have been a bit easier if the bottom lashes were full and the magnets matched up. That is how the full sets I have seen work. Still, I have not seen a full set with magnets at each end that the user has ever matched up correctly. Lashes with only one set of magnets work much better. Also, some companies state that users should not apply mascara to the fake lashes, so people should check directions.
I just love your lip color in this video!!!! 😍😍😍 what is it???
Can you try Ardel
Love the video!! I’ve been thinking about trying lashes just not good at them at all and liner lol .. what kind of lipstick are you wearing??? I love it!!!!
These did not work for me.  I am in 40s and sparse short lashes.  These where obvious I was wearing them.  There was even a big separation between my lashes and these.  So I have very few little ones in front and big long thick ones at end. eeek!
I have 17 years experience as an Ophthalmic Assistant...this video made me nervous. Please be careful when applying ANYTHING to your lashes. One accidental poke (especially with those nails) can be a disaster. I’ve seen scratches from nails, mascara brushes turn into cornea transplants.
Happy Christmas 🌲🎅🙂
These are the bold right???? I’m so confused between these and the accents. I don’t want the full band. I tried them before and they were too big for me.
I like your eye liner that is under your eye what brand is it?
I LOVE YOUR LIP COLOR.
Please stop calling it a he lol
I love that bar looking earring! Where could I get one
Where did you get that cute bar earring?
Ur eyeliner 😍
Fav mascara ever
Nice idea but don’t like how they are noticeable when you look down
🦄
Didn’t you only compare two different lashes in that video? How can you say these were the best when you compared them to one other lash?
Sorry, not cute at all. 😩
It doesn't look good when you were looking down. But good try
Love it
4:30
Did anyone else notice how horrible & unnatural they look when she looks down?!!
My 17 yr old daughter is in love with lashes but I am not in love with the glue that’s been making her eyes puffy. There is no hiding the glue from her lol, thank you for making this video, I’m definitely going to get her a set. With a bit of practice she will be glue free. Thank you from a very grateful momma
Kandee! Where is your ear cuff from?? So cute!
What kind of makeup do you recommend for someone w/ BAD allergies to most makeup?
your right eye isnt even on properly though..
You look great with or without makeup.
what if I just wanna put top lashes?I don't want to put the down one. Will the magnet work this way? With two lashes on when you look down it doesn't look natural and real. I definitely wanna try this out though!!
Great Tut! Thanks!
Great demo, Kandee
I thought I'd be a sub but I can't with that baby voice and talking to us like we're kids "this little guy..this little buddy let's place him here SToP ew u overkilled it with all the hype clearly they look like garbo
Does anyone else just want to push those lashes closer to her lash line? Lol
No. These really look terrible. Seriously.
What lipstick r u wearing
I have them they don’t work at all
I’m having such a hard time putting them on. 😕Why didn’t they put their applicator in with my lashes??
They look ridiculous when you look down
I  LIke IT ! good Vid  !!
It looks great!
I just watched your whole mascara mermaid commercial on someone's else's video.  I loved it.  I came straight here to tell you...💜
hi
No girl sorry but they look terrible when you look down
Want to try them now! Thanks
Hiii Ms. Kandeeeee !!!  Miss you  ( :          God bless you and your family     Merry Christmas
Kandee have you ever heard of or have you used “thrive causemetics” infinity eyeliners??? The Company says that they are waterproof and will stay on for up to 24 hours. Just curious what your thoughts are regarding this Product I saw it as an advertisement after one of your Snapchats. I take your word as gospel since you are the make up Queen. I love all things Kandee. I am one of your biggest fans!!! Enjoy your Christmas with your family and have a Happy New Year!!! I follow your sister too on Instagram.
The bigger strip lash looks like it is hanging off of your lashes on each end.
yeah its true the corners when you blink look detached and the corners are so important to look good.  hmm i don't know i don't think so
@learningtobefeatless
here before the notification. ! don't have a life 🙈
Cute cute
You are beautiful but the makeup looks clownish. Lashes look really bad when you look down. Dont sit on lash line well. Like your videos.
So, I know I’m way late to the game, but I love your hair color and this month, September is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.  Teal is that color.
Fine!
Awesome

Do you like country music? Do you want kids? Do you only speak and understand English?
Those fingernails are horrible.
This is the best magnetic review I’ve seen so far! 🙌🏼
Kandee has such wonderfully shaped eyes.
The magnetic lashes I bought on Amazon from Perfect Misfit work perfectly for me. I  have been wearing them almost daily for about a month and they look full but natural. I think they’re only $13 too so not bad!
I am a subbie cause I am captivated by your GREAT personality, and you truly care about ppl, makeup is superficial and means nothing to me, yeah I wear very little of it due to my busy life, but I'm here because of your up lifting nature!  Peace and Merry Christmas :)
So proud of you for getting the video up!! go you!!!
YOU DID IT!! YOU GOT THE VIDEO UP!!!
What would you guys like me to test out next?!?!
Would you review the magnetic lashes by Lori greiner from shark tank? She sells them on qvc.
"Like what if your eyelashes just got brushed." 😂😂😂😂😂 I'm DEAD
I was going to order a set of the Lori Grenier magnetized lashes on QVC, but they were sold out. Enjoyed this verr much, Kandee. Many blessings...MaryEllen
Thank you Kandee for being sweet and honest!!!!  You are the only makeup person I truly trust...
Love you kandee your smile brightens up my day ! Love your reviews.!!!!
I wish you wouldn't have had the wings on so that we could see the lashes better! :(
Would love to have a tutorial of this makeup look! You are so beautiful 💕
English accent was dope!
Cheaper don’t always mean things are worse. 😶
Hi there, I was so sad that you stopped Vlogmas.
How can you not love Kandee
Thank you so much for reviewing the magnetic eyelashes. I have been curious about them but too chicken to try out myself. Now that I know they work and of course which ones not to try, I am excited to get some. You are awesome and I love you so much!!!!
Gazooks! 💜 you Kandee ✨
You have the same accent as Gwen Stefani 😍 Its so mesmerizing
Congrats on being a judge on Glam masters!
I was cracking up watching this... LOL
This totally changed my perspective on these. I might actually try them now- depending on the quality of course
Is it just me or does her mom look like supermans mom from justice League  and man of steel?
would you actually start wearing these or do u like the glue on lashes better? Xoxo
Where did you get those earrings? I lovveeee them !
I really want to try these now. I wonder how long they hold up
I'm glad you liked the magnetic lashes. I did a review on my channel as well. It took alot of time and practice but now I love them!!
Your voice reminds me of the girl in orange is the new black that has white hair and beard glasses, think her name is lolly... And I could listen to it all day. <3
Kandee is shook! 😂😂😂😂 like she literally shook her head😂🤣🤣
Your hair is so beautiful! Love the tye dye hoodie!💙💜❤️🧡💛💚
it looks really good i have just bought mine from "Aliceva magnetic eye laces" lets hope mine looks as good as yours 🙏🏾 Your tooo funny 😂
Kandee the winged eyeliner Queen!❤️nobody does better winged eyeliners!
Finally I get to see it!!!!! I've been waiting and enjoying your vlogs but you need rest! Kandee my heart needs you I sent you an email it's from emilyfaithn if you could please read it I would truly appreciate it. Your words and heart are healing to me. I love you!!!!
This review came out extremely helpful! Thank you for the post
Magnetic lashes: LoL you crack me up! I love your videos lady. ❤❤❤
We need vlogmas back!!😬🙏🏻  Your mom and sister are GORGEOUS!!😍 Hope you're doing well..Love you, Kandee!!❤️😘 xoxoxoxoxoxo
this is the first time I've been on youtube as one of your videos goes live, love you Kandee <3 wow my Mac autocorrected landed to landed :/ hahah
I can’t imagine trying to use tweezers to apply these 😳 thank you for the review beautiful! ♥️
Thanks for doing this!! I was so curious about magnetic lashes!!
Yesss new upload!❤️
I would not put magnets next to my eye. Dangerous. Can make veins bulge.
I absolutely love seeing you! You're a ray of sunshine! All that said, PLEASE SLEEP! You need your rest! We'll be here still supporting You! Love ya Kandee!!
😂😂😂
Love this!! Thank you for the comparison!!!
Thank you for putting this up in the middle of all the craziness you've been doing! I love watching your videos!
Loving the blue!
Still wish I could do periwinkle...pastel blues are the hardest.
Rock it!
Yay! I'm so excited you did this vid! I've been scoping these lashes out and was going to go for the cheap ones but glad I didn't!!
Early squad!!!! Love you girl!
Man I’m thankful for Latisse !!!
Love you, girl! I'd dismissed the magnetic lashes... It seemed they gave an oddly abrupt straight edge to the lash line in some review photos. They certainly didn't on your eyes, tho... So I may try them. Thanks so much! 🤗 Been following u 10yrs now lol. You're so real..a rarity these days! 🤓 Love ya, girl! Keep smiling!
Thank you for the demo! I want to order the magnetic lashes. They look really good! I struggle with false eyelashes so these seem like the answer for me.
Try the ones from Wish. Under $5 with 3 magnets, full lash and awesome. Although I haven't figured out how to get them on yet lol. Thanks for the help with the video
Eek! I'd be scared to put those cheap ones near my eye. What if the magnet fell out and got stuck in my eyeball?!
Oh Kandee you make me laugh so much! You are so sweetly exasperated 😂 Love you lots!! 😘
I want one now! The real ones though 😂
Lol landed this video is awesome. I️ love these kinds of vids! Haha
Thanks for the review...I've been wondering about these for in between extension fills!!!
Have you ever thought of getting lash extensions? I love mine and don't have to mess with falsies!!!
Idk why but she reminds me of Rollins from law & order svu 🙂
😍😍❤
omgsh!!! i love you Kandee! next week is my birthday😄
I absolutely NEED to know where those earrings are from!!!
Love u❤️❤️
Dude, I think the Amazon ones got shipped to her already used. Yuck lol.
Yep, those cheap ones looked AWFUL even in film! I think I have I’ll stick with my glue on ones for now😉 
Thanks Kandee for letting us know👍🏼 much Love and ((Hugs))💗😍😘❤️❤️❤️
Congrats that you finally got this video up!
Hi Kandee, have you done a Scarlett O'Hara makeup look?
Omg candy, my eye has been swollen for the past week and I really didn’t know what happen and now I am realizing I may be allergic to the lash glue I tried on a few weeks ago.  I’m seriously watching you and my eye is itching and hurting😭😭😭  

I bought 4 drugstore eyeshadow pallets and I have only try them a little because of the eyelid is peeling
Thank you for doing this. I was wondering about them too!
There are full length magnetic lashes too!!  Waiting to receive them in the mail but glad to see your review.  I ordered mine from boulder vibes
i remember your good friend from the video you did on her for bridal makeup 1000000 years ago, loved you ever since 😍
Ahhh I love your personality and I love how expressive your face is and that mouth 😍😍😋
I posted my review yesterday, was wearing them All Day today, im thrilled with my magnetic eyelashes. P. S Love You Candee You are one of my inspirations. xxx
Yes! I love watching your videos! Love you Kandee! ❤️
i dont understand what the magnet attaches to on the first row - can you explain that? thanks Love your videos!
You are so hilarious!.. I love you... 😂😂😂❤💋
thanks for the video, Kandee!! huge hugs from my house to yours!! ❤️
You are so cool!! My mom and I think you are absolutely gorgeous 😍😍 and we love your lips!! What kind of lipstick do you use???
Lol. Great video. Im concerned about magnets near the eye so its a no for me
Yaay you found the footages! I'm excited
From what I have seen is that they are definetly a gimmick! I dont think I would spend a penny on them, lol. I will stick to the glue. However I am dying over all the methods you tried to see if they would come off, i.e the shake test. You always find a way to have me rolling on the ground Kandee! I love you.
I don’t wear lashes and had never even heard of magnetic ones before this - but I follow your snapchat and IG and feel so invested in this video.  Well done for fighting through the set backs and getting a good video up.

Also please take care of yourself, I love watching your videos, but getting 2-5hrs sleep a night because of editing them, is not good.  Choose sleep xxx
I’m so happy you were able to get this up! You did such a good job!!
The amazon ones looked already used. Especially how it was bent in to a shape.
First pair looked incredible on you! I like them only toward the end of my eye as well! I just bought a pair of Ardell from Walmart for $11.89 and cannot wait to try them out. You're absolutely hilarious!😳
But how are they sticking on? Do you have to use a special eye liner or something?
They are half hanging off even when they are on, same thing I saw with ALL pricey ones. To date magnetic lashes are no bueno. Get the eyelash gun, much better.
Are you still doing vlogmas????
From Snapchat I know how long & hard you worked on this video...,great job!!!!  I hope you are feeling better & were able to get some rest 💕. It seems from following you on SC & your social media your always on the go. I know you hardly get a break but if anyone deserves one you do Kandee!!!  I hope you & your family have a happy holiday season!!!
I was always curious about them.  I definitely want to give it a try because the glue on lashes can be tricky.  Thanks for the video.
Yay! I look Howard to your videos
I can’t believe what ppl get away with selling sometimes. Thanks so much.
There is a brand, I forget what they are called I wish you would try, they are full strip magnetic. Was just looking at them yesterday
Which exact type did you order from One Two Lashes? I'm constantly buying glue-on lashes and this looks like a good investment. Do they stay on under water? (I heard they do, and if you've tested it out, please let me know!) THANK YOU!
I love love love you earrings! Where did u get them from??? Love you tutorials!!! xx
YOU are the bestest, Kandee girl!!😗🍭🍬😊
Love u kandee u make my day ❤️
OMG!! Don't even with magnetic lashes..I still can't figure out how to put normal falsies on LOL
Kandeeee! I love you ur so beautiful and amazing ♥♥
Yaaay another upload!! Btw what hair color product do you use????
Girl- where have you been?????
I haven't seen your videos in my subscriber list in months! What the heck YouTube
Fun stuff Kandee! ♡
Great video!! I can't wear these though :(... I am pacemaker dependent ... ( magnets change my pacemaker settings!! ) Stephanie Lange found an awesome brand , ( several styles I think thy have ) that she still wears . I forget the brand... I think..,, they were mid range priced and higher end.,, I don't remember ... but she had a video!! These look great Kandee!! Love it!! I have a lot of allergies, and I would so wear these... if I didn't have a pacemaker !!
I like how you randomly do a British accent lol :) Love your videos and positivity Kandee <3
Love you, Kandee.  Such a bright, funny, quirky and sweet soul.  And, and, you will review pretty much anything in the beauty world.  Thanks for your commitment and dedication to helping women.  I appreciate you.
That intro though lol 💖💜💖
When she tried to shake em off....i almost peed😂😂😂😂
Imho, this is so sponsored. In every sponsored video everyone’s wearing thick liner and never do a makeup free demo, or a real close up. And the way you were focusing so hard on showing they don’t come off and how you immediately started bashing the cheaper ones is obviously instructed behavior. Why is it still so hard for youtubers to admit they’re getting paid?
I love how colourful and happy Kandee is blue and pink are like my favourite colours ever
I have so been waiting for someone to try these!!!
Amazon will probably refund you without even making you send them back! Thanks great video :)
Omg I Love you  so much you are so pretty!!!!
Magnets are not good for the body
Maybe you can try to curl the first ones with an eyelash curler and at least Snapchat your results!! I like the idea of magnetic lashes. I can never get my eyelashes to sit right so I only wear them around Halloween
Your the best Kandee!
Your my inspiration
You're so funny😂❤️
I'm sorry! Just know that I loved it as well as I love your channel! Your the best and the Kandee!
Enjoyed this review I have reviewed the version of One Two lash that you tried and now they have the full coverage version that I love.  Regular lashes with glue used to be an epic fail with my allergies...Thank goodness I didn't get the cheap ones! OMG Don't pull them off like that 🙈🙊
You are so funny!
That beginning 😂😂 I replayed it 5 times loool
Love seeing another video from you, but I hope you can get some sleep!
I bought my false eyelashes with glue for 5,60 usd, from Depend, & they have lasted 1 year. I use them almost everyday. I have cleaned them sometimes.
YOU DID IT CONGRATS GIRL!!!!!! YOU FOUND THE FILES YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I have a latex allergy so yeah even the #Duo lash glue will makes my eyes swell.depending on how long i keep lashes on! But I was shocked...SHOCKED that the magnetic lashes from @Amazon came that messed up and you hadn't even tried them on!! Cray-Cray! You look beautiful as always, your skin looks so smooth & soooo clear n perfect!!! Mine..not so much! Lol. Much love from #Ohio  
WE❤🍬🍫🍭🍬🍫!!!!(KANDEE) 😉😙
Thanks for the information on the lashes. I have been considering buying some so this video came in really handy to me. Thanks again and, as always, I hope you are having a wonderful day! 😊✌☃️🎄
Oh my god. I just watched your video and it was so amazing! You are so sweet Kandee. I love you! Hope you have wonderful day!
I tested these out to for a video.  FAIL.  You actually did great.
Ur an amazing person 😉❤️
I love mine from One Two. I’ve worn them many times over several months and they’re still in perfect shape. I’ll throw them on before work and skip liner. My eyes are still defined but it’s super quick, just takes some practice. I like their Accent ones more for a subtle daytime look. 
P.S. I teach and wear them all day just fine. Also, apply any mascara(if you want to at all) before applying. Then, you clean them much less.
This video really made me smile! Thank you so much Kandee!
Great video!!!! Never heard of these. Love your hair color. Omg gorgeous. You can pull off any color
Is there any safety issue with having magnets that close to your eyes?
Where did you purchase these from
Kandee wishing you merry Christmas! ILYSM 😗😗😗
Kandee did you already quit vlogmas? Lol.
❤️❤️❤️
Kandee, did you put on mascara prior to using the magnetic lashes??
Great video Kandee. The music reminds me of your old, old videos back in the day! Love it! Haha x
I love your blue hair. So awesome. Blue and pink are my fab colors 😍😍
earlyyy
I tried them and couldn’t put them on. Admittedly I cannot apply false eyelashes either.
I got a set coming from Wish!! I hope they work
I died laughing when you first showed the Amazon lashes.
💕💗 Love you Kandee!!!
Lol when you explain what it's like to put lashes on for the first time is exactly what I thought. It took me like 5 times to reapply them and they still didnt feel right. I just started putting them on a couple weeks ago, didn't ever think I would like them, but I really do!
That's like perfect Christmas gift for someone actually yey
Thanks kandee I️ bought the one two lashes as well and am pretty impressed 😻😘
The brush and hug tests 😂
You're literally Erin from the Office
i've been waiting for this video for so long lol... snapchat fam! these actually look super interesting, i don't ever wear lashes because the glue bothers my eyes. maybe i'll give these a try sometime!
Your earrings remind me of Jem the cartoon, her earrings! I love them!!!😍😍😍💜💙💜💙🙌🙌🙌
<3
They don't give that curled effect though. They sit horizontally but I've seen a lot of beauty gurus and other girls stick them on vertically so you can see the volume.
I have been wondering about the magnetic lashes for a while now. And I even thought of asking you about them. I am so happy you did a review. Thank you so much! I have wondered how safe it is to have a magnet that close to your eyes. I guess it isn't strong enough to do anything to your eyes, but it just kind of freaks me out. I wonder what kind of glue they use to stick the magnet onto the lashes too. Some of us have sensitive eyes. Love your videos. You always make me smile!
Amazing lipstick!! Can you tell me the brand and color please?
I love that you have high arched brows because I do too and it seems like everyone else’s brows are perfectly straight and the has a tail lol
Which ones did you wear the bold, or accents.
Magnets near your eyes? Is that even safe?? The things we do to look good lol
Test out cat eye stamps , pleeeeze😊
Ooo what her lipstick its so pretty
This is wild!! I love this!!
Thanks for reviewing these Kandee!
Type - o! 😂
11th lol
That shake test 😂
Uh.... hold up - i think i've been applying lashes wrong this entire time??? eek!!
Yay the video is up! Love you kandee

FINALLY!!! I’ve been following you on SnapChat AND I’ve been waiting!! THANKS for all your dedication! I LOVE it!! By the way, I was up ALL NIGHT looking at your videos AND I have to say you look SOOO MUCH younger than you did when you started this channel!!! (BTW...my comment is BETTER than Amelia’s!!!.....LOL! 😘)
Hi
I just do eyelash extensions. Now I'm wondering if I should get these instead, and leave my girl that does my lashes w/o a job lol
YASSSSSS BOOO
I had the same experience with the cheap ones. got a refund
Loved the video! What lip color were you wearing?
how many times can you use them?
I literally laughed my butt off when you did this video ; seriously to friggen funny😊 but who ever made those cheaper one's are like: 😣😤😥😬😡
They seem so intimidating when you read about them.
The Ardell ones test
I tried these and got so frustrated!! The second ones you tried. I had those. From amazon. Mine were the same way. THEN, when I pulled them off, I tried to pull the lashes apart and I ripped the lashes off the magnet 🤦🏼‍♀️. Which the magnet was only a tiny piece in the middle of the lashes. So I’m just gonna stick to my glue ons. Oh, and when I did get the lashes on, at one point the magnet was burning my eye. So no. Never again.
What happened to Vlogmas? Hope you're taking care of yourself Kandee
This video was so worth the trouble getting it up lol I can't believe those cheapo amazon lashes
Kandee, you are THE BEST!  BTW, I am obsessed with the sparkling cider shampoo and conditioner from OGX. Delicious!
One-two lash actually came out with a new version with two magnets, one on each end ! They meld better with your lashes because the original sticks up awkwardly on some places :/
You're so funny. I bought a pair on the wish app and they were horrible! Maybe I'll try that spendy ones since I have a latex allergy
how are these selling? They seem dangerous...
I love your videos, Kandee!  :-)
Hi Kandee!!!! I love you!!!!!!
Your teeth are so white!! What did you use, if anything!?
"Formula, blah, blah, blah " lol
I loved this review
Love those earrings, where did you get them hun?????
You are hilarious
They look great! I just got some- but I totally need another set because it only came w two!!!!!!!!!!!!😠
Omg if you pause on the amazon picture of the cheap lashes it SHOWS YOU THAT THE MAGNET IS HALFWAY OFF
Are you still getting married?
what lip liner are you wearing?
You look like Sharna from DWTS!
Lol those Amazon Lashes
I got one on amazon for like $12 two pairs and they are awesome. At first quote hard to apply, I decided to cut them in two parts to apply them like you did. The good thing for me is that now I don't ruin my eye makeup crying because of allergy.
Omg Kandee has such a pretty eye color
I'm not into these.  Even well applied they stick out like regular falsies coming unglued at the outer edge of the eyes... they aren't curved to follow the eye contour and look very boxy and unnatural.  :/
Do you think they would work for people with NO NATURAL LASHES like chemo patients??
Hello
Hate it deal couse cache look on this magnificent just not face you make to it false stuff, but free look lashes can't be magnetic, (
I have the one two lashes and I despise them. They didn’t fit on my eye shape at all, if you’re not wearing liner it looks awful and the magnets fell apart after two wears.
You are amazing at makeup
Why can’t I look like kandee?!?!?
That lip color! I ❤️ it!!!
I can see the end of the lashes are not attached and go straight. Booo! This happened to me. They don’t curve good even though I bend the strip.
OMG Kandee you did it!!!!!!
Loveing your hair color
😆💕😘😍
I want her eye color 💕
“...just throw those in the trash, I don’t even care!” 😂
answered my wifes question about getting these,awesome
They’re not wide enough. They only cover half of the lash.
This is so dead and gone now......
I saw them at walmart and i was like wuuuuttttt????
Ouch. 💔
Hi, Kandee! Thanks for the videos. Idk how to let you know that if you need good clean humor, there is a great lady named Jeanne Robertson here on youtube, we saw her perform at a local venue and I think you will love her because she is a senior citizen, she is hilarious and she was Miss North Carolina over 40 years ago, and she's still a beautiful lady.. I'm such a fan, please try her stories, they are short videos, I think you'll enjoy her😃
I can’t even open my eyes lmfao
What lip color/lip stick are you wearing?
Which dentist installed the veneers on your teeth, can u demo that
I love you kandee
They seem so sparse.
Wew, you are late to the game. Even Rhett and Link tested them lol
They look weird when you look down i dont like how the are just part of the lash i like regular lashes love you candy💄💋💗
Hey
Use a tweezers
My sister in law just gave me these for Christmas!!
Wow
Я русская
Great video !
Nope ! I don’t like them at all.. they fall off after some minutes.. the magnetic don’t stick on too well as glue so I’m a stick with false ones but if there’s ppl that are allergic or whatever reasons that’s crazy I’ve never heard of that before but might just be good for them if they want to wear lashes. Which make everyone look beautiful . I just don’t like em
Lol! Kandee you make me laugh at the end. Just throw these in the trash I don’t even care
Kandee should have her own makeup line and business haha
+kandeejohnson  I see magnetic lashes as a dream product for theatre and film.  Our fellow YouTuber +julieg713 is a professional make-up artist who's ideally placed for field-testing magnetic lashes on a film shoot - correctly designed, the magnetic lashes will provide enough accentuation of female talent's eyes for the camera.
How old is her oldest son now? 20? She looks so good
Anyone know what lipstick she is wearing?
She would have better luck if she just got rid of those claws when applying the lashes.
I Like  it  !  Very Entertaining  !!
Kandee!! I missed you!! Your videos are so funny!! I've been watching you for at least 8 years, and it's like you haven't aged! Im glad to see you've stayed grounded even after hitting it big!! So proud of you, hugs!!
Search MIAA Beauty Magnetic lashes on amazon and you guys won't be disappointed. We came out with magnetic lashes with 3 separate bottom pieces which make for an easier application and better control. Also our set comes in 2 different styles! Check them out!
I like you and I like to have you 💙💚💛💜💓💕💗💘💝💞💟
Kandee, you are so funny and what a great personality and sense of humor you have. I have Ocular Rosacea and have to use eye drops several times a day. Because of it, wearing mascara really causes a lot of irritation. My eyes are red to begin with. I was hoping for something to help with my skimpy eyelashes and hoped these magnetic eyelashes might be just the ticket. But One, Two suggested not to get them wet, so now what do I do? Do you have any suggestions? Thank you
Thanks for the review! Also, I love the top you are wearing! Where is it from? 😃😃
I guess its not !-2-3! but the results are great! Thumbs up!
Omg I ❤️you
I luvvv your sweatshirt

Funny.
this was better than your makeup tutorials. ❤
Did anyone else watch this and worry the whole time she was going to get swatches on that white top?  lol
I am so annoyed that my camera was focusing on the candle in the background, then the makeup, then my face! I had it set to film on just the makeup and my face but the camera had other ideas!!!! ha ha ha ha
Your hair fits perfectly with it lol 💕
Ok...what's the story with the "english" accent lol.... then some other random accents hahaha
I LOVE YOU KANDEE!!!! And don’t focus on the negative comments.. focus on how your video is trending 💁🏽💁🏽💁🏽
You are the kindest soul on YouTube. DO NOT let the negative overpower your beautiful heart. You are amazing! Btw, when it comes to swatching in a white top, you are a pro!
On behalf of all the disgusting rude people who left nasty comments .. I’m sorry.. we appreciate all your hard work and love you tons! Don’t listen to people who have nothing but keyboard courage 💛🌸
Please let me apologize for the horrible focusing issues with my camera, it wanted to focus on the candle in the background instead of me it seems. And I edited this really quickly before I left for Thanksgiving! I am firing myself from editing...ha ha ha But if this is your first time watching my vidoes...please enjoy any of my much better edited transformation videos! ha ha ha ha
Its so sad that she’s getting all this hate. She wanted to get this video up quickly just doing her job ya know. She was so excited about it to. Kandee love your videos! Thank you for going out of your way to post a video for us to be entertained with 💕💕💕💕💕
Tbh most of the time i watch these videos i don’t even care about the makeup i just love watching Kandee talk and react to things ☺️☺️☺️
Thank you Kandee for taking the time during a very busy holiday week to put out content. Great video and your hair looks awesome
Don’t know why everyone is complaining about the editing. I️ thought this was still a great video!! Good for you for getting this up before Thanksgiving! 😍🧡
OMG, love the hair girl. I am using this to tell Mark that I am allowed to open my presents early too lol!  Love you girl and hope you have much to be thankful for. ♥ Elle
I ❤️ you, Kandee! Yes to vlogmas and no to internet trolls! #snapbaby #kandeeismyfavorite
The anxiety, that the swatches were going to transfer onto your white jumper 😰
I love that your videos are always so upbeat and your always the same ol sweet Kandee!!! Love the excitement in this video
I’ve heard of you before and this is my first time seeing your videos and I love you already  so you got yourself a new subscriber!!!
You are the best! Don’t let the haters bring you down! You did the best to your ability! I love your videos!!❤️❤️❤️
Did I miss something? Why is kandee johnson getting so much hate and little praise? Its been a long time since i checked this comment section but it makes me sad. Of every youtuber ive ever watched youll always be in my top 3 id want to meet because of your warm loving personality. Im sad you cant post a quick video before thanksgiving and get much more than negativity over small editing blips. Its like the old youtube when i just came for the person, not so much of a production. I know you probably wont see this but ill always love you lady! have a blessed holiday with your family!
Kandee I've watched you for years, you are the 1st YouTuber I followed watched all your vids , you are so uplifting so wonderful and I always absolutely love your vids feel like I know you, you are so wonderful have a blessed day
So much love to you Kandee. I have been a subscriber since day 1 and have soooo much respect for you. Please do not take these mean comments to heart. You are amazing and have a heart of gold! Love your videos and everything you stand for. Enjoy the holidays with your family. Big hugs! 💜💜
This isn't any different from when Paris Hilton used her name to make cosmetics.
Hi Kandee! I watched this when it first came out before the wave of negative comments and I have to say while watching I enjoyed your video SO MUCH. I did notice a couple of editing errors and laughed thinking "poor kandee must have been hella tired while editing xD". But it didnt bug me at all because honestly it feels like OG beauty videos!!!! You know, before ppl hoarded make up and it was simply a few girls playing with makeup, using their bed side lamps and web cams and being candid. 
I loved the familiarity. I wish we could go back to simple videos like that :/ 
Id love for all your videos to have those "mistakes"
This collection matches your hair! So pretty.
I'm really not impressed by any of this.. the colors aren't coming off pretty. I can find way better products that aren't hyped up because someone's name.. 
Seems like kandee is a fan girl or getting paid to make this video. Something is off
Lmao that one highlighter clip right in my middle of the lip swatches 😂
I'm so sorry that so many people are leaving such awful comments!! Sure there were a couple spots that it wasn't focused, and weird angles but who cares? Youtube is about sharing information with others and creating what you want, not about being perfect. Everyone mess up sometimes and it's not even that bad. And there are also nicer ways to say these things. Love you Kandee!!! You do you <3
I don't see any reason for anybody to be leaving such vicious comments.. I thought it was a great unboxing :) Its the holiday season people, if you have nothing nice to say, dont say anything at all!! Kandee is a beautiful soul, and anyways come on the video quality and editing is way better than some of the other makeup videos out there. But that isnt even what this is about. This is a beautiful community online coming together to share the love of an art, theres no need for hate. Love you Kandee!
Why didn’t u actually wear the makeup and try it
"I'm trying to see what is the difference between angel and savage" Dammmnnn Kandee you're so shady. 😂😂😂
Seriously need that gift set!
You should turn down your lights so we can see the swatches better 😭😭😭
Kandee know that you are so loved! Unfortunately when videos trend some of the meanest people decide to comment. You are beautiful! You’re doing wonderful! Some people don’t understand how hard you’ve been working on so many projects for us and the fact that you have your kids to take care of and love on too! Keep being the wonderful amazing person you are! Love you 😘
This is my first time watching and I loved it from the first second ❤️ subscribed and turned on notifications
Would be nice if ig was you in the center of the picture, being in the corner of the frame isn't good. And sad that we don't get to see full swatches closely. And a camera that unfortunately focuses wrongly.
Sorry Kandee, cause I usally love it.
Hugs
We all aren’t perfect and who care if lighting or angles aren’t perfect? If you’re so good at editing get good enough or relevant enough to have Kylie’s PR team send you this set and then make a better video?! Oh wait- Kandee is amazing and relevant and WAS sent this set. So???? 
I think kandee is the real winner here. 

K- you are the sweetest and most genuine YouTuber of all time. Every time another influencer talks about who is the nicest one they’ve seen or met- it’s always your name. You have a heart and soul of gold and your talks and quotes and times you talk about losing your father on snap chat make my heart so happy and content. I relate to you a lot and feel your pain through the screen. But I equally feel the love and warmth you give off. God really is present in you. 

Love this and YOU So much and have been watching for YEARS. 

Sorry people are being so digesting in the comments. But your fans love and are fighting back and supporting you. Ignore the trolls! ❤️❤️❤️❤️✨☺️☺️
If Kandee annoys you then QUIT watching her!! Shes amazing and such a beautiful soul. Stop bullying her!!!
VLOGMAS, PLEEEASE!!!  😄
I LOVE YOU AND YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SOUL. Your inspirational quotes you post on Snapchat some time make my day and I wish I commented you more often on how fabulous you are and how adorable your family is ❤️ You are still one of my favorite youtubers and don't let the mean comments get you down. Honestly people get too into details, I just hope they learn to appreciate things more at sometime in there lives.

Wish you the best of luck and would love a favorites video for this month for possible Christmas gift ideas 🤔🤔
Love ya!! 💖💖💖
Your excitement over the packaging 😂 same
Could you do a tutorial using these products?
I really like Kandee!  I just don't get the random English accent she randomly throws out all the time.  😂  But she is flawless and I like her tutorials.
Love you, your energy and personality!!!!!  Too many critics out there! Don't Le them get to you!
You could film an out of focus video for 24 hours, with no editing, and I would watch the whole thing. Just watching and listening to you makes me happy. I pray for the people who feel the need to talk shit to you. Your positivity and love is appreciated by so many. I hope you're heart is filled with all of your loving fans so that there's no room for the haters. Love you, girl. Rock on with your awesomeness!
ahhh i wish you didnt move around so much while showing the swatches
Thanks for taking the time to think of putting out a video before you spent thanksgiving with your family
I love you Kandee!
I’m so sorry people have left mean comments to you when you’re the sweetest person ever and try so hard to be happy and inspirational in all your videos! Please ignore the meanies cuz you’re adorable and I bought your whole collection when you collabed with Too Faced and have all your nail polishes too! Please keep being you! Happy Thanksgiving and lots of hugs and love! 💖😍🙏🏻☮️💟🦃🍁🍽😘💖💖💖💕💕💕
Just wanted to say how much u are luvd n appreciated! I have 2 young daughters, 10 and 5 who absolutely adore u... We have been watching your videos FOREVER! Your luving, positive, passionate, and compassionate personality is exactly what we need more of! Pay no mind to the internet trolls...😝 Ur fans luv u! 😘
People who are complaining about the angles and swatches are so annoying! She LITERALLY just said its a SURPRISE UNBOXING! She did not know what was in the box before opening it - I think this video is amazing you can tell shes super EXCITED about all the makeup!!. Kandee stay lovely as always! <3 <3
Lucky BeautyGuru. And ya’ll need to chill the f out she’s doing her best, she has kids to keep up with and a career to take care of. 
Kandee your the best you fo you girl! Much Love XOXO
Yes, please do Vlogmas!  I have yet to try any of the Kylie cosmetics but they look gorgeous!!!  Love your videos Kandee!  xoxo
okay everyone need to leave her alone! i love this video! and if anyone things otherwise, leave! if you think the quality is so bad, make your own!
Love! I don't understand why people are so mean and take time out of their day to tear others down. I love you Kandee. You're so inspirational and good at what you do. Never stop. ❤
I just found this channel and omg she’s so cute she reminds me of gwen stefani
On three, two, one... exiting this overly dramatic review
I’ve never commented on anyone’s videos before but felt compelled to say that I’m appalled at the terrible comments people have posted. Thank you Kandee for letting your Snapfam know what was in the box, I love your enthusiasm. Seriously if you can’t say anything nice don’t say anything at all. Bullying comes in many forms #BeKind
I'd be interested in seeing looks you can create with the nice eyeshadow palette. I've seen swatches all over, but I'd like to know if the makeup is really worth it and you seem to be a trustworthy beauty blogger!
Please stop the British accent... no need...
I'm loving the teal hair!
"It's so chalky and fabulous!" Since when has chalky been desirable in eyeshadow??
The editing in this video is so horrible
Just came to leave a nice comment because no one deserves to be spoken to so negatively. 

You are appreciated and loved! #snapfam :)
Snapchat family! Love you and your family so much! I love all your videos. Don't let people bring you down. You bring so much joy to so many people. Keep being yourself and know that you are wonderfully made and blessed and highly favored. 😘❤💄
Love you Kandee! This video is awesome and thanks for reviewing! Keep doing you❤️
I miss the old YouTube when everything didn't have to be absolutely perfect.  I can't believe all of the negativity.  Why are so many people like that in society now?  I love you Kandee!  I have been going through a hard time lately and I keep going back to the videos in your "Inspiration" playlist.  I've seen them all so many times, but they still make me feel better.  I imagine you hugging me and encouraging me through these tough times.  I use your videos to cope every time something bad happens.  You have no idea how many people you have helped and continue to help in this world.  You give me hope.  Even though I am poor and live in a dump with no running water, and I just found out I was cheated on (and that he was doing drugs behind my back), my grandpa is dying, I have no friends, etc....You make me believe that there are great things waiting in my future, things that I could never even dream of.  This is building my success story even bigger.  Maybe this is my slingshot moment :)
uggh the unfocus was makin me eyes hurty🙁
Thank you Kandee for doing this. I know you're really busy and yet you still take time to make videos and show people amazing things. Ignore all the nasty comments and keep focusing on your family, your life, and your wonderful upbeat outlook. Huge hugs from my family to yours.
💙💚💛💜
Adjust your contrasts!!!!!!! It's so bleached bright!!!!!!
Yeeeees, please do vlogmas. I promise to watch every day. 
I am not interested in Kylie's make up, but I watched anyway because ur the best. 
God bless u.
I haven’t read all the comments but she said on Snap people where telling her to KILL HERSELF over this video? What kind of psychotic bullshit is that?? It’s a makeup review video & Kandee is literally one of the nicest, sweetest, most caring people I’ve ever seen & that kind of shit is absolutely uncalled for! Who gets that worked up over makeup reviews?? I’d like to know one logical point these people have for telling her that BS other than they’re clearly mentally unstable. Oh wait, there is none. :|
Kandee you are beautiful very talented women I love watching your channel..with all the hate going on in the world this is last thing we need to see, come on we can do better, I think kandee know what she doing she had this channel forever, I like to see any of you even try to come close what she has to do to make a video, edit it then post it!! Move around!! Kandee love ya💜 haters gonna hate!!
Omg. You are literally the sweetest, such a positive light and I LOVE YOUR SPIRIT SO MUCH. Haters gonna hate but don't ever stop because you are an inspiration. LOVE YOU.
LOVE YOU KANDEE!!
They two palettes look exactly like Anastasia Beverley Hills palettes down to the velvet packaging and the 14 shades set in two rows
Kandee !! I love you 💕😘❤️! It was sooo lovely meeting you in Temecula the other day. Thank you for always inspiring me
Happy Thanksgiving Kandee!!!!! I've been looking forward to this since yesterday when you accidentally uploaded it and then took it down lol
She always bring new stuff out when im broke 😡😢 actually  feel like crying . X
This collection looks super exciting!!!
Am I the only one who would of waited until Christmas to open it?

I love surprises!
Can you do a whole make-up video by only using this products , please? ❤😘
You’re swatching too fast! I barely have anytime to appreciate the swatches! 😩
I love watching your videos, they always brighten my day! Love you xx
vlogmas! Please! 

I love you Kandee! :)
Love you Kandee so much
Yes to Christmas 🎄vlog. 
Will you do a tutorial using this make up?
YESSS IT RELEASES TONIGHT IM SO HAPPY U GOT IT OMG i needed a review thanks kandee
Ignore the haters. You just snuck a quick review in. Videos do t have to be 100% every time. Who cares?  I love your attitude and personality.
Leave it to my baby girl to come through right in the nick of time! Thank you baby 😘💕
I wish that lippie had been green too girl! That wet set is too die for! I am loving your collab with ogx in candy gumdrop💜💜💜💜
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Ugh I don't support the Kylie brand.
I came here from Snapchat ready to defend Kandee, since she claimed people were being so nasty to her in the comments, but after looking it seems that it’s more people just giving feedback? From what I’ve seen no one has been straight up mean. I feel like their critiques are justified as this video is definitely not her best. She seems like a wonderful human and I really enjoy her videos usually but I think being able to take constructive criticism is part of being a YouTuber.
No real interest in this kit, lol, but I come for Kandees bubbly personality. :)
You were one of the first, if not the first, YouTube makeup artist I watched. You taught me so much about makeup but on top of that you are truly a kind soul. I follow you on instagram, Snapchat, etc. and you are so full of love and kindness. Don't let "troll comments" get to you! Great job!
I LOVE YOU KANDEE💕😘
Omg ily and this is awesome! You’re definitely my fav youtuber to watch unboxings!❤️
Yasss! This got me in the Christmas mood 😍 love when you unbox stuff!
it was fidget spinners now on makeup
Kylie packaging is so low end. I have to admit  there is one eyeshadow  n lipstick I wouldn't mind having but due her business ways she deals I've told myself I can't support.  Which probably doesn't  matter cuz there is always someone buying it.... it's my opinion and choice  and I'm able to have one
I love you so much you are the very first beauty influencer I ever followed on YouTube and u are my number one inspiration and I love how beautiful you are on the inside as well as the outside..  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you kandee, this video is great!
I am LIVING for that Nice palette.  STUNNING.  Yay. Can't wait to order, your video was just in time.  Thanks babe❤❤
Her: " Oh my goodness it looks like snow "

Me: I haven't seen snow in 3 years what does snow look like?
I haven't been a big kylie fan but...... I hear my wallet crying because I need the naughty palette!!!!!
Such a rebel! Opened before Christmas!😘🎄🎄🎄
Yes do the vlogmas! If i could id buy all of it! It was all stunning 💖😍
Loving the eyeshadow palettes. I think these are her best shades yet!
I adore you and love that you were on the ball with this!!!
Why was this video all over the place? There was a random shot of highlighters in the middle of lip glosses. ... ?
Lots of the swatches aren't even in shot??
I love you ❤️ your the sweetest and so amazing !! You deserve everything good that could happen to someone !
Not testing unless you actually use the products. JS
Kandee, I just love how loving down to earth person you are. No matter what you have being trough... You are the real deal!  You have a pure heart! Love you!!❤️❤️
Kandee, you are amazing! I’m always so excited when you have a new video up, I don’t even care if the camera quality isn’t the best. Thank you for all the hard work you put into stuff and how loving and positive you always are!! ❤️❤️❤️
Girl you are soooooo beautiful inside and out! 😘 love this video and the fact that you make it real and real isn't always perfect ❤❤❤ 🤗
6:25 this is so awkward idk why
I love you kandee you were the first person I watched on youtube for beauty and I believe you were one of the first people to be doing this here on youtube. So you paved the way for everyone else you are still my favorite you-tuber. You are so kind and sweet and amazing at what you do people always have shit to say even if they dont know what they are talking about. Yous a queen ❤💕👑🍬🍭
Vlogmas would be great fun, Kandee 💕
This is my very first time watching one of your videos and your outro made me tear up! That was what I needed to hear this morning! I will forever be a Kandee Johnson fan 💗✨💗✨
Keep up the amazing work!! you are such a beautiful, kind, loving human being 💕
I love you Kandee hugs from me!! You did wonderful on this video like you always do. You work so hard and you always have top notch videos. Keep up the amazing work, don’t let anyone bring you down 😘
You are the most wonderful and uplifting human💖!
 you already know this, but the hateful remarks people leave on your channel says more about them than I️t does you.
Why test something by someone who rips off other people? "Stealing"
I have been watching your videos for years. I loved this video, love your hair, and love you! You can’t be everyone’s cup of tea and that’s okay. 😉Yes to VLOGMAS!  Huge Hugs! Xoxo 💙
Kandee your amazing
Dont listen to those haters could you say jealous much?! 
I also love your personality and your British accent amazing!
You are an amazing person and don't let those haters put you down!
Stay awesome and sweet just like candy!
Xx
I enjoyed the spontaneity of this video, it was a little fast but clearly you just came back from a shoot so it probably was later on in the day. People just need to click out of the video if they feel some type of way instead of being haters behind the screen. It’s the holidays people, relax.
Her swatches make me cringe like why do you put on so much on your arm?
Sad how people can be so judgmental. Please let me know your YouTube channels so we can see your hard work. My Lord Kandee is the most positive of the beauty community. This is sad to see hate. Love you Kandee
Awesome video Kandee you look fabulous 😍Thank you for the swatches I have my eye on  the NICE palette the colors are beautiful.I am going to buy the lip kits for friends and family stocking stuffers💄💋I love the packaging on this collection too!  🤩✨ take care and have a great  weekend Kandee!
LOVE YOU KANDEE ❤️❤️
Don’t listen to the haters. I love you girl and I hope you have a better day. Sadly people just don’t know when to stop. I love you girly! ❤️
Just cuz the names of the colors are christmasy doesn’t make them remind me of Christmas :(
ignore the haters and be as positive as you always are! You are such a happy persons. and people should learn from you.
You look very beautiful  with your new makeup kandee Johnson. Your sounds  very incredible. 

Great job with this video.  Keep up the good work,an I will be watching more of your  video's.
I love you and your YouTube channel it’s so fun, fresh and drama free! Thank you for being genuine and amazing!😘😘
Kandee! Love the video. Great work! I love your energy. Don't mind the negative comments. Keep on doing you! I LOVE you and your beautiful heart.
 Keep your head up sweety.

Love from Amsterdam!
I don’t get it why is everyone being mean kandee is honest and kind! Everyone please get over yourself there are far to many problems in this world for everyone to be pissed at this video
Miss Kandee Johnson, you are the light at the end of my dark tunnel. When I am feeling blue I instantly feel better when I see your videos and loving words of inspiration. People who are pooping on this video because of lighting, focus or whatever, clearly haven't loved you since the beginning. I've watched your videos since you were doing tutorials on Tshirt cutting and crafty ways to repurpose items around your house. Now.. I must say your videos have improved tremendousley since those days. LOL! I'm from Hamilton, ON Canada and I think a meet and greet in Canada would be amazing or even a follow on my instagram (@kayyewilson) to know you are sending the love to the Canadians :) I am so blessed to have an inspiration like yourself :) xoxo
I just saw this on Kandee's Snapchat and I wanna say I love your videos and your makeup tutorials. I love to hear your opinion on new makeup products. You are an amazing Godly person and I love you very much despite what all these people are saying. I support you 100% And I will stand by your side no matter what! Love you Kandee! ♥️♥️♥️
Love you Kandee.  ❤️
I have been watching you since waaay back in the day, when you had that really loud camera haha! You have come so far dear, and you are very inspiring! 

Xoxo
Yes, a Vlogmas, would be fun.
Love you Kandee, please do more videos for YouTube this channel I miss them. Happy Holidays 💕
Thank you for fixing the music!! 🙌🏽❤
I love love LOVE you kandee! I missed you in Temecula, i was so sad that i had to work. The video is AMAZING! 🤗❤🤗🤗❤🤗❤🤗❤🤗❤🤗❤🤗❤🤗
Omg luv u Kandee and your vids are always amazing. Just by watching this vid I might actually go and a Kylie lip kit lol. Been watching for years now and I think your an amazing loveable super talented sweetheart. Keep the vids coming honey.
What is it , a bigass box of drywall mud with color added ?
I love you, big hugs from Finland! Stay true to yourself,you are you and I love that you are different from other youtubers. You really care for everyone and you are so natural and truly lovely person ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and to all the haters, if you have nothing good to say,don't say anything. 😉
Hi Kandee! How are you? 
Thank you so much for making this review!! I was able to decide on some of the colors I was thinking about getting. Don't worry girl , there's still some of us out here who realize that videos that we get to see are a privilege not a requirement and that we all make mistakes. Sending some positive vibes your way and hope you have a happy holiday season!
Sending love and hugs YOU ARE SO AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL KANDEE, I LOVE YOUR SWEET PERSONALITY AND ENERGY ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thank you for being you!!
loveeee this girl! Can’t wait to see a look with it 🤩
Kandee you are amazing. You are a powerhouse of a woman and I love you and your reviews! Keep shining your light and don’t let the haters get you down! 💛💛

Continue to SLAY girl!!!!! Forget about everyone else, haters will always hate! Keep up the good work!
Omg so jelly!! Enjoy!!!! She does amazing on her products! You're beautiful Kandee! ❤
Love the video you look so gorgeous as always!!! At 13:16 you accidentally snuck in highlights watches again...did anyone else notice that?? Hope everyone is having an amazing day!!!

You must the sweetest person I follow, keep doing what you do. 😘
VLOGMAS PLEASE!!!! LOVE ❤️ my girl “🍭🍬🍫”
The Naughty palette looks so pretty with the spice lip set! And yesss, you should totally do a vlogmas 💜
I love love love, that you got this delivered and needed to film an unboxing/swatching video then get it edited while still getting to your family thanksgiving. Thank you for thinking of us while still getting to your family. I'd love to see you so a look with everything.
I would love the wet set. It looks beautiful.
Love you!! Don’t let people who have nothing better to do get you down! You are seriously the most kind hearted person I’ve been on social media and should be so proud of that!
Thanks for always producing content Kandee!! 💕

Love your videos Kandee! You are the most real and sweetest person on YouTube! You are honestly such an inspiring woman & you brighten so many people's days!
Love this video and you my sweet Kandee- Been a sub about 7 ish years - and the reason I still enjoy watching your videos has EVERYTHING to do with your personality and skills 💖💖
Loooong time fan here ❤ is that the crown from your Queen of Hearts costume tutorial in the background? 👑 I so miss those old videos!!!
I feel so bad for the nasty comments you received, you are amazing and I love you and your videos! You have a such a big heart and a sweet soul I hope the rude comments don’t keep you from posting, keep your head up💕
Bad idea to do a bunch of swatches in an all white blouse, but I like the bravery❤💜❤
Omg this video was a total mess! So disappointed
beautiful! wht highlight did u wear at aia awards doll? happy thnksgiving 💗🙏👑✌️
Why are people so mean? Kandee, your pro! do your thing girl 🙌🏻 we're still watching.
💗 Kandee....this video had me excited about this collection... the only thing that made me nervous was you wearing white and doing swatches....i would've gotten it all over myself. 
BTW ain't no one got time for negative comments....those should be deleted. You're awesome!!!
Sending you hugs🤗🤗🤗🤗
You’re gorgeous and SUCH a sweetheart 😍
Love you♡♡
Your videos always rock girl! Don’t worry about what everyone is saying. Thank you for always being so joyful & true!
Yes vlogmas, please!  😜 🌲 
Happy Thanksgiving, Kandee and Family!!
Love you Kandee! Thanks for doing this video! I wouldhave been too excited to wait too! Yes, do Vlogmas!
Kandee Johnson, you are fun. I love your word choice always, my goodness you’re beautiful. Much love! 🙌🏾💕
Everything is beautiful!
Love you Kandee!  You are inspiring. Although famous you remain humble and kind. A beautiful soul. Remember hurting people hurt people. Some people just lash out in their darkness.  Just brush off the negative comments 😚
So glad you were able to upload this. I went to go watch it yesterday but you had already taken it off....  but omg it is suuuch a nice collection 
I especially liked the spice lip set and the naughty eye palate
Ppl are so cruel.. forget the haters.. ur so sweet and kind.. i live for ur sweetness.. so keep doing u.. and dont ever cry cause ppl are so stupid and jealous of ur journey....❤❤❤💙💙💙💙
Pass on both eyeshadow palettes for me. I like the first lip set you opened and the highlight palette. Videos showing the 4 highlights and how they look in make-up looks would be awesome, Kandee!
Kandee I have been watching and following you probably since you began YouTube. You are brilliant and so creative, not to mention loving and caring even through the screen. I’m so proud of how far you come and your true fans would agree with me. Keep up the great work and ideas! You’re gunna go even further than you realize😊
but what was in the no peeking box
You are beautiful! And one of the kindest, sweetest souls, don’t let the negativity get to you. 💜💜😍😍😘😘
YESSS TO VLOGMAS 🎄🍭 love love love your holiday decorations ✨
Savage🤪swear Kylie is always jockin #RihRih
Kandee, you are such a sweetheart and a doll! I have enjoyed every single video you've ever done. 
The bigger you become, the more ugly people show up to hate on you. Bless them and keep being awesome. ❤️
So what if the video isn’t perfect, kandee is a real person like everyone else, and sometimes you don’t always get it right, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Thank you kandee for always being yourself, and the positivity you spread is amazing
I️ have been watching kandee since her shaky old cam corder days. Stop being so mean ppl. She is amazing! Kind and beautiful. She was excited! 
First world problems. Oh no it was out of focus. Kandee. You are amazing. And loved. ❤️❤️❤️
Love you Kandee! Your videos have pulled me through so many bad days. I always love hearing from you. Sending all the love and hugs I can your way ❤❤❤
Thank you for working so hard!!! Especially the hard work that it takes to be genuine, you are truly appreciated!! XOXO
I like the quick and real video. All good for the glossy and perfect edits but give me some Kandee realness ❤️ Trust your videos ten times more than those flashy perfect ones. You are perfectly imperfect and I love it.
Always love your videos! And seeing your smile :D Big Hugs from my house to yours!! ❤️❤️❤️
Love you Kylie jenner cosmetics of makeup yes  Is beautiful so Cute all
We need vlogmas!!!! PLEASE. I can never get to much of your upbeat positive attitude. I also love your hair and would love the deets on what was used. Thanks for the Kylie holiday review I think the wet set will be my first purchase. 🌲🌲🌲🌲🔥🔥🔥
You should do more makeovers
Vlogmas? I am up for It! So good to see you. You make me smile!😁
I love your personality! You’re a breath of fresh air. So glad you reuploaded this video.
Excuse me MEAN, HATEFUL plow please, but not everything is perfect. She is who she is, so don’t sit there and say “I love her but she was crazy in this” no, Kandee is ALWAYS energetic and enthusiastic which is exactly why we love her. Don’t go getting all pissy acting like she’s a horrible person or YouTubed when not EVERYTHING must be perfect to your standards. I happened to love the video aside from the focusing issue which I’ve never noticed before but like all problems it can be fixed so let’s not hang the poor girl for it. GO YOU KANDEE, ❤️❤️❤️
I love you! You're the only you tuber I watch dedicatedly. Also one of the only ones I feel is genuinely the same on camera and off. I'm so happy to see how far you've come since the days when I first started!!
I actually really enjoyed this video. Such an awesome energy you share with the world Kandee!
Kandee I love you videos so much! A couple weeks ago I saw you at Flo's diner in California Adventure. I was too nervous to say Hi to you, but you have been a huge inspiration. I love watching your videos and your positivity has helped me alot. <3
I ❤️ you, Kandee! Yes to vlogmas and no to negative internet trolls! #snapbaby #kandeeismyfavorite
kandee i love you but what is up with your video quality? babygirl you are better than this video and swatches. KANDEE 🍭 💜
Kandee, u are so amazing and inspire me daily with your positivity, I have learned so much from you makeup wise and more importantly handling hardships,,, I have been watching you since I was ten years old (15 now) and I just want to say I love you so much and you are my role model ❤️❤️❤️
Ignore what all these haters are saying. They're just being unnecessarily mean and cruel. You are inspiring, a truly beautiful soul and your videos always make my day brighter xx
Some people are just trolls and hide behind a keyboard.  Kandee you are a positive light in this messed up world,  keep doing what you do!! Huge hugs from my house to you💙
The REAL humans on this video LOVE IT AND LOVE YOU and there is NO reason for this DISGUSTING things being said. She is so sweet! 
Keep up the GREAT WOrK girl
Don’t listen to what people say you make the best out of everything and so positive you are a amazing human and people need to take there hate some were els
People who try to bring you down, are already below you. Just remember that and keep doing what you’re doing
Love your videos Kandee! Ignore the hate! Not every video is perfect because no one person is perfect. You keep it real and I love you for it. Happy holidays!
That's so wonderfully awesome!💖💙💚💛💗✌👍🤘
In the video you showed how confused you are with both formulas owned by kylie, the velvet is the one that doesn’t dry down and  the matte is the regular líquid lipstick.
Sending love and positivity! Xoxo
Do vlogmas! I love your black roots - have you thought about doing a balayage from black to blue?? That would look STUNNINGGGGG ON YOU
It's only 700 dollars
I ADORE YOUR VOICE U SOUND SO ENTHUSIASTIC
Thank you for being a light of positivity on youtube your amazing <3
You are such a beautiful person inside and out. Thank you for always being exactly who you are. You inspire me more than you know.
For all of you mean haters, Kandee has been in YouTube since before some of those youtubers even where in the map! Kandee has always shown us that she is a loving, sweet, truthful person! Don’t bash her. 
Kandee: you are more beautiful than you know, more talented than you think and more loved than you can imagine! You taught me that, just remember it ❤️❤️❤️
What is the price of the whole xmas collection?
Kandee! you work your BUTT off here on Youtube, I respect you and look up to you so much! thank you for uploading this fun unboxing, would love to see some makeup looks with these. this collection looks so dreamy, wish I could afford any of it hahaha! love you!

Hi Kandee! I just watched your snapchat story and wanted to say that I always LOVE your videos, and that I hope you know there are so many people out there who think the same thing ❤❤❤

Your video is trending on YouTube! See, the critics & haters just make you more famous 😉 I love you so much Kandee sweetie! You are seriously sweet as Candy 🍭 I genuinely didn’t notice anything wrong with this video. I’m rewatching it now. I made a YouTube video once on New Year’s Eve and I just did an off the cuff vid and another YouTuber I watched commented and thanked me for taking the time out of my holiday to make a video for everyone. My sentiments exactly in regards to you! Thank you for taking time out of your Thanksgiving with your family to create and upload this video for us. I watch your vids as soon as you upload them and I actually had no Thanksgiving plans, and you made me feel less lonely. I love you; I’m thankful for you!!! 😘😘😘
Kandee, you are sooo beautiful!! and always sooo fun to watch!! don't ever change anything about yourself because you are truly unique and super kind and loving. there are people who are hell bent on making other people miserable just because they are miserable. but pay no mind!!! We love you,and adore you!!!  Let the haters keep on keeping on, damn bah humbugs!!
You have a lot of energy - thanks for the video. Like the hair too!
People who try to bring you down, are already below you. Just remember that and keep doing what you’re doing!
Loved the video! Thank you KANDEE!!
Oh Kandee I'm so so sorry for the hate you've received on your YouTube 😢 this break my heart 💔 You are such a beautiful light in this world and especially social media! Do not let those trolls break your amazing spirit. I look forward to your snaps and instas daily. They always brighten my mood ❤️ You are so wonderfully inspiring and positive and even when you're having a bad or negative day you still use it to brighten your followers lives and show us we're never alone. Keep being fabulous you and if no one else in the world ever appreciated your sprit again know I do ❤️ but I know there are so many others like myself who feed off your outstanding energy and love you! P.S. your Too Faced Collab lippies are my every day lips and your shadows are my favourite! Hugs from me to you!!!

People are always going to try and destroy your happiness and positivity. It’s up to you if you let them! You’re a beautiful person inside and out! Your snapchats really lift me on dark days xxx
Well I thought the swatching was okay. But I do have to agree with the “bad” editing 😕 Eitherway! I still enjoyed it! ❤️
I LOVE when you go into that British accent! I hope y'all have a fantastic Thanksgiving! Much 💜💜💜
Yes this was so helpful thank you!!
CONGRATULATIONS ON TRENDING! Happy Thanksgiving beautiful 😘 I love you like a sister XOXO
I loved all of the colors from everything that you showed! Everything was so beautiful!

You’re truly amazing kandee! Don’t listen to any of the negativity. Love you
Yay its back!!! Love u kandee!! Congrats gor hosting the 1st AIA!!!!
I dont care how terrible the lighting is or that it doesnt focus on the makeup. I think we all focus on how beautiful you are - jealous!
I feel like we were in sync with our reactions to the eyeshadow colors. You could do so many beautiful looks with these colors, I love them!❤
oh wow so many you tube experts on here
sitting behind there computer making awful comments. So do you feel good inside know? does that make you happy making someone feel bad about something they created? honestly if you take the time out of your day to write a mean comment to someone about a you tube video!  then you really need to have a good hard look at yourself 
and seek what is going on inside because it certainly is not positive and its an awful way to live your life. Kandee I made a YouTube account just to tell you that i am a huge snapchat fan of yours and i can see through your videos how much of a huge heart you have. I am so proud that you are doing something that you are so passionate about that is something alot of people are so scared to do and I think that's alot of reasoning behind these comments 
jelousy 
you are an inspiration to me to do what I love and to live my life kindly

don't worry about the haters you are a huge success and are doing a beautiful job i think you are adorable!  xxxx
You all need to calm down with the hate comments.
Kandee 

K-ind soul 
A- mazing makeup skills 
N-ever disappointing 
D-oesnt judge others 
E-veryone loves her bubbly personality 
E-very video makes me happy! 

I love you Kandee. I’m not good at making poems. But I love and appreciate all the awesome videos you have created! I’m so glad that I found your channel, you are an inspiration to me and all the girls in the world! Huge hugs from my house to yours!
You are the best! Don’t let the haters bring you down! You did the best to your ability! I love your videos!!❤️❤️❤️
Is it sad that I’m more excited about the packaging than the actual product? Am I the only one? 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️
You were so quick with the swatches, it felt so rushed!
I really think the people being disrespectful need to F*%k off, kandee your amazing and keep doing what your doing!
Screw the haters, we love you!💓
I couldn’t help but cringe over how big she made her swatches🤦🏼‍♀️
Kandee, 

I have been watching you on YouTube for years now, and every single video you make is amazing! Thank you so much for taking the time to make these videos for people like me. I usually base what I get at ULTA and Sephora on your videos, so I make sure I watch each one so I know what to buy next. You are amazing, and you are so full of joy and positivity! That is such a rare thing these days, but it's one of the things makes me, and your other fans, love you so much. :-)
Everyday til Christmas! How fun!! ❤💋❤
I'm so early
Love you and all of your videos! I’ve been around since the days of Betty Boop and the Everyday Princess series! Probably before that but ya know😋❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love Your Vlogmas 💕🎄💕
Omg GIRL ignore the haters! I love you so much and am so inspired by you in every way! Love your videos ALWAYS
I wish I could rock that haircolor, you look fab 👌😍
You’re so beautiful girl! Keep it up!! Xoxox 💜
Lots of people are complaining about framing and lighting but I found all the swatch colors to be visible, and all the products were featured which is what this video is about. If folks want a perfectly edited video, watch her other stuff! It's fun to watch you getting excited about makeup & supporting other peoples' products, Kandee!💞 I love both of those palettes & the creamy powders!
Kandee, what were you wearing in the video? You look gorgeous and comfy 😍
Struggle swatches had me cringing
Kandee, you are a wonderful, bright shining star in an often times not-so-lovely world.  I'm not even interested in Kylie cosmetics, I just heard about all the negativity you were getting on this and wanted to let you know I love and appreciate you!  💜
When you have a busy life outside of YouTube, which probably means you make deadlines for certain things, not every video is going to be PERFECT. Y'all act like you didnt get the review...give her a break. My goodness.
Beautiful Kandee! You are amazing and I love you! Ignore the negative comments!💖💙 you are always telling us we are loved and making us feel like your family! So just wanted to remind you of how loved you are by all of us!💓💙
I love u & ur channel kandee! will always watch everytime u upload!!!
Ahhh I love this. So happy I discovered this channel.
Early squad ❤️🙌
Love you Kandee leaving you some positive vibes 💖
Can you make a video about ur hair? Please! I recently dyed my hair purple and im thinking of going blue next. Id love to hear ur tips
Everything's so nice!! Thanks for showing love  you tons ❤❤❤❤
Yes! I would definitely be very interested if you did vlogmas! Please do blog's?!
After watching Jefree and Tati review products watching this kinda stressed me out, its all over the place.... no order!  The place where you are sitting, the way you review and show the products... all over the place. PLEASE BETTER YOUR VIDEOS FOR YOUR SUBSCRIBERS... the most I watched was 3 minutes. 

Never watching a review from you, no personal but I like order
Love you Kandee!! NEVER change girl ❤️❤️
Ma'am I just adore you so much!!!!!? Always my fave YouTuber!!!! You have taught me so so much!!!! Would LOVE to meet you one day!!!!? Lots of Love  and Hugs Hugs!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
You’ve always been my favorite! Keep doing what you love and encouraging others to let their beauty shine.
Love you ❤️ this is the Christmas spirit♥️
You're very brave to swatch while wearing white lol
I should be doing my college work, but I’m having a Kandee video marathon 😂💖
Do more Vlogmas!! 🎄
These look really pretty , the nice shadow  would be what I got. Have a wonderful thanksgiving! I will be happy with any type video you wanna make.
The weird comment about using wipes then a paper towel, what a mess.
Well I️ in fact know that you’re so amazing and inspiring and encouraging!! Thank you for loving us everyday and helping me through life!!! I️ love you so so much kandee! Thank you for being my role model and inspiration
Very pretty collection. I hope you realize how blessed you are to receive so much make-up for free. As always, have a wonderful and blessed day! 😊✌
Sending love and light your way Kandee. You seem like a truly beautiful person inside and out. Keep doing what you do ^__^
I looooove this
Kandee! You are so wonderful and I love you. You inspired me to do makeup YEARS ago. Loved u then and love u still! Don't let hate get you down, you are one of the TOP beauty influencers of all time!! I guess cuz of that people assume u don't have feelings or whatever... I don't know. But you are absolutely beautiful and crazy talented and u have made such a mark in the beauty industry and you are so IMPORTANT. You are so kind and don't deserve this. Im sorry if im dragging on but I feel so strongly about this stuff lol. You are INCREDIBLE and I look forward to seeing more goodness come into this world purely by you existing ❤ sending love and good vibes!
haha! "I was not paid to have my name start with a K." love your humor! keep up the great videos!
Thank you so much for doing this review Kandee!!!💓 For the negative peanut gallery that's hating hard.....expressing support and love to  Kandees videos would be a more constructive approach for her than being rude.
Your white sweatshirt and the swatches are making me anxious oml 😂
Love you so much Kandee xo 😘😍💖
Silver and emerald eye shadows!! But everything looks really nice, anyway.
i remember watching you since i was 6 years old (i'm 13 now) i love you so much ❤️
I LURVEEE the way the emerald packaging matches ur hair!!!
Yayyy loved the video💙 I love you kandee
Hey Kandee! You are amazing and wonderful and such a sweet person. Don’t let anyone’s negativity bring you down. I love you!!
Don't listen to all the mean comment they wouldn't know how hard it is to film! I at least can't and I believe you did an amazing job!!! Loveeee your hair btw!!!!!!
Did anyone else notice how patchy the shadows are? Like sure the colors are pretty but that formula tho... 🙈🙈🙈
Loved the video :) I would keep hitting the like button if I could,makeup looks pretty,PS love love love to you Kandee,the world doesn’t deserve you,you are what your name is for Sweet ❤️❤️❤️💗💖 :)
Love you girl. You are so beautiful inside and out. ♡♡♡

Kandee you are the cutest!! I’ve been watching you for years and I’ve always wanted to meet you and if I ever get to I will be so excited you don’t understand! Love you so much!!!
The world is full of negative people who only want to bring others down. Continue to shine and be who you are. You have a heart and personality like no other and  I love that my girls admire you. They enjoy your videos, love you in Trolls and watch your snaps. Do not change who you are or what you do. You are loved by many.
So glad you reposted this!
I'm here to brighten the comment section. People are so mean like they know everything. Love you Kandee!!!
Kandee you shine brighter than your haters ! I've been watching you since I was 12 and now I'm 21! you inspire me everyday !
Please do vlogmas!  I really miss you doing videos on a regular basis.
Sloooooow down girl !!!! Maybe she was just excited but it was very messy ...
This video was a mess. There’s so many editing mistakes :S It’s very cringe worthy. So fast, so misinformed... Looks like she didn’t even want to do this review, like she wanted it to be over right from the start.
This whole set looks amazing!! If I could have one thing from this set it would probably be the spice lip kit!🌲❄️♥️
Vlogmas please! We missed you <3
Thanks so much for filming this Kandee! I’ve been wanting to see more of this collection.
Kandee, you are one of the original makeup influencers that paved the way for the beauty world on youtube. I like watching your candid and true reactions to products. You are real, positive, and inspirational! Don't let the haters get you down. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but you are also entitled to not listen. Have an amazing day!!
Best YouTuber ever!! ❤❤
Ur swatches give me anxiety.
Kandee you're amazing!! I love you and your videos!! Beautiful beautiful beautiful inside and out 💖💖💖
Did her lipstick swatches make anyone else uncomfortable??
Kandee you're such a warm soul ❤️💋 I love how sweet you are and kind...and I LOVE YOUR LAUGH. It just brings joy to my heart when you sometimes start laughing so hard. It's just gosh darn cute. Don't listen to all the haters, you have 1mil + subscribers  for a reason. I seen your Snapchat and thought I'd bring some positivity your way 😘🤗 love you XOXOXO
I so wanted to know what was in the no peeking box 😭😭😭
Idk when people started thinking everyone and everything had to be perfect “Oh my gosh your camera didn’t focus” “this video was too quick....blah blah”. Your amazing Kandee! You won’t get a backhanded compliment here!
Kandee!!! This video is so amazing!!!You are so cute and I love you so much! There is a reason that you are #31 on trending... because this video is great!
Sorry Kandee, but your camera needs to be lower or wider!! I want to see you swatching and almost every time you swatched it was out of frame. :( :( :( This video was frustrating to watch
What’s with the random English accents 😂👏🏻 these all look so pretty and your hair is on fleek 👌🏻
Always love your videos ❤️
Great lipsticks from Kylie! Can't wait to try them!
Love you xxxxx
The lighting it's blinding me I couldn't even appreciate the colors :-/
Love you Kandee. You are so beautiful and real. In my opinion you can do no wrong. 😊
Was I the only one hoping that she would not get anything on her white sweater. Those lip swatches were a bit too close!  Girl you are brave!!
Kandee, you are magnificent! Never stop being the light you are! The haters can just sit there and eat soggy turkey sandwiches. Much love to you and your family, Kandee!!!
whoooop ❤️❤️❤️❤️ ilysm 😻😻😻
LOVE YOU KANDEE❤️
Kandee you're everything and so inspiring..... you're  always going to have people who hate but wouldn't dare do what you do so let them have their bad comment cause that's all they have and keep doing you Boo.... I have meet you at a few meet and greets and are truly a sweet, amazing, and gorgeous gal with a huge heart ..... don't let them even faze you #beblessed
I love you ❤️❤️❤️ haters should just start their own channel and stay in their own lane.
Love you Kandee, but for some reason the camera quality wasn’t very good.
Yeah pretty but not worth 200 dollars.
if you keep speaking in a british accent then i cant continue to watch your vids.
I would so so so love to see vlog mas. I would be so excited everyday.
Loved it Kandee!!💗💗 I hope to see a vloggmass!!
Much love for kandee 💋 you do you!
All the make up is 🔥
Hi Kandee! Will you do a holiday house tour again?
You’re the sweetest Kandee i love you so much 💗 💗💗💗💗
Vlogmas!!
I loved Naughty the most omg 😮
Yes yes yes absolutely wlogmas!! 😻😻😻
You are a lifesaver ❤❤❤❤❤ thank you
Yesssss to vlogmas!!!! Miss your videos x
Your videos are usually so on point but everything in this video seemed all over the place.... the constant focus issue, the angle (you're constantly out of frame) and even the lighting seemed off...  anyway I love you but couldn't finish this video
Kandee, you inspired me to get into makeup...don’t listen to the nasty comments.  I get excited every time you have a new video up.

My goal is to start a YouTube channel myself.  When I do, my goal (or at least my hope) is to meet you in person so I can tell you how you inspired me.  Keep being you and don’t let anything get you down.

Love ya and God bless!!! 😊💋💄💖💝💞
Love your hair Kandee 😍😍 and its a great vid, have no idea what other people are talking about
You are amazing at what you do I love the video couldn't ask for a better one people need to leave their rude comments to themselves they don't know what you were going for with this video it's hard enough editing I'm also YouTuber I just got back keep doing you you are one of my favorites congrats on trending❤❤
Kandee you did such a good job on this video I love your hair so much ☺️💕😍please don’t let anyone get you down or tell you things that you are not cause you are just so down to earth and have such a sweet heart ❤️💕☺️ love you kandee ✨🍭🍬🍭🍬
06:30-06:50 was that supposed to be an edit? I do this with my speech at times I'm dying right now. I love you!!! 😂😂😂❤️
Kandee videos always makes my day,  and don't worry about the haters, haters are going to hate you rock and never change!!
I won't be buying anything from this collection. (Just thought I would answer her question at the end of the video, rather than address the crazy comments section, which I kind of did just by writing that... dang).
Idk y do swatches when Kylie does them too
Saw your Snapchat, read the comments. I know I'm late to the video and you probably won't see this.. but ignore the jerks! You're gorgeous and the video was fine.
You are so awesome Kandee don't let the haters get to you! I love you! 💖💖💖💖
Vlogmas! ❤️
Yes VLOGMAS IS A MUSTMAS!!! Haha
Yay!!  I love new Kandee videos!  You make me smile.  :)
Please do vlogmas!!! Luv u Kandee!!❤️🎄
😍😍
I think 🤔 I like the highlighters and matte lipsticks
COMPLETELY IN LOVE WITH THIS VIDEO i love you Kandee so much you are the most adorable human being to ever live
you guys are brutal!! how immature to leave such hate on a video!! shame on you and your lack of morals! be nice to her!!! she is human, sheesh!!!
Love you Kandee!! So easy for people to be mean from behind the screen - you just keep doing you!! 💖
Your hair looks beautiful :) love you kendee :)
All Kylie's shit looks the same...I thought.  Especially when the first few lip kits came out.  All the colors looked the same.
Honestly Kandee your camera is fine and your perfect! Don't listen to these hateful comments.... it's just people who don't have anything else to do except put others down... Love you!!!!
I love you kandee!!! #snapfam
Don’t let the horrible people get to you. There is a difference between constructive criticism and just being hateful. Your video was just fine! Thank you for thinking of your audience enough to get it out before the holiday. ❤️ you.
I want to see you do an eye look with some of those shadows and a review on the formula etc...
Worst review ever!
YES TO VLOGMAS!!! <3
Vlogmas!!!!
OKAY BUT WHAT WAS IN THE NO PEEKING BOX???
Love your energy
I liked the naughty and nice eye shadow things the best. Also, I would like to see you do vlogmas. I think that would be super cool.
Loving the Naughty pallet,  craving a break from neutral expectations because of my age!! Makeup should be fun and uplifting!! Love to You 😘💋😍
Kandee, I love your videos Always!! Big hugs!!
Love u. 😘😘
You ARE worth a million times more than all these idiots commenting negative things. How people can actually do that in the first place really baffles me. The world needs more of people like you Kandee!!!! Beautiful, kind & genuinely down to earth. Please don’t listen to them and let them get you down as that means they’ve won!!!! Ignore them and rise above it. They are just jealous!!!! Sending love from the UK xxxx
Kandee don’t listen to the mean comment your beautiful and all your videos are beautiful too 💜
I mean GIRL the haters gonna hate and they’re no need to give them any attention just be you 💅🏻😂😍
Forget all the petty haters. You video gave me a case of the smiles. Keep being bright and cheerful.
I'm loving your hair 💕😘🎀
I love your new hiar
did u repost this?? cuz if u did I lost my legend comment
Love you, sweet lady! You’re beautiful inside and out!!!
Yesss, vlog everyday til Christmas!! I could watch & listen to you all day! You are soooo talented & loved more than you could imagine also!!!!
I️ personally love this video. It’s so concise and she’s not one of those YouTubers that talk about just one product for half the video. Straight to the point, LOVE IT
This video seems rushed and while I like first impressions I just feel like the swatches are weirdly lit.  Also there was a lot of weird editing and just ... I feel like Kandee is just so much better than this.
Frustrating to watch. Focus camera yacs
omg swatching in a white dress😂 giving me anxiety kandee
You're awesome Kandee!!! You are such a sweet and generous person! I strive to be as kind as you are! Don't let mean comments get you down! You are an amazing makeup artist and YouTuber as well! Never change!!!
I love that no matter how long Kandee is on the internet she is still always so sweet and genuine. I love that I can always come to her channel and get my spirit lifted.
Honestly women look better without so much tart paint on their faces.
Love youuuu !! Ignore the hate!!
"I haven't seen it" 
* ordinary face *
This is terrible! WTF is going on?!?
I think your hair color is prettier than everything you've shown!
Love you lots Kandee ❤️
You are the best and don’t let anyone put mean comments in this section! Do your thing and love it! Believe in yourself! Muah 💋
Kandee, you are amazing! Love your videos and dont worry about the negative comments. We love you and will always support you!!
how are arm swipes a test? ive been here since the beginning when you used to do actual tutorials all the time...what happened kandeeee?😩😢
Love you Kandee! I hope you had an amazing Thanksgiving ❤️
Was anyone else getting anxiety watching these swatches with her white as snow sweater 😶
The camera is so out of focus 😭
Kandee it’s unfortunate that people feel the need to be crazy mean. You won’t escape the haters out there but knowing  you bring awesome sauce to the table should out weigh the bad. Even if you make ONE person smile, laugh or feel good about themselves that’s you do best! Never let others determine your self worth. You’re the shizitz!! Keep on keepin on. 😉
Kandee you are amazing, heard you on the radio this morning!!! Congrats and blessings!!!
Never seen swatches like the ones she did, terrible video! I love Her but I’m not feeling it
I love her so much ❤️❤️
I love how everyone in the comments all of a sudden turned into little Martin Scorsese' s. "Fix your camera, slow down, don't talk like that" get out of here people. She obviously knows what she's doing.... hence the 3 million subscribers. Keep doing you Kandee. Rude, insecure, people will always try and make you feel the pain and misery they're in. Sending love and good vibes to you, and everyone in the comments. I hope it rubs off on some of them.
Constructive criticism can be helpful but disrespecting hateful comments wont be helpful at all! Kandee was the first youtuber i started following and she keeps inspire me with her kind words, her amazing heart and great personality! Hugs and so much love from my house to your house kandee! Bless your heart, the world needs more people like you!
I love how excited you are about each swatch, it makes me want to go buy some makeup! Love ya Kandee 💕
I understand adding color to your face to make yourself look alive and eye shadows for fun but girls these days are getting so obsessed with adding friggin cake to their face and being super particular about videos like you aren’t going to sit on your phone for the next 5hours watching another 10makeup reviews from someone. So stop being so friggin negative cause learning about this makeup and how to put it on will never cover up that ugly ass attitude you have coming out! As women we need to be lifting each other up 
And I love everything Kandee does cause she shows me it’s okay to be human, make mistakes, and look good doing it.
Love the video but you all over the place sis
I love this tutorial. Great job dont pay attention to the haters .
I love love love you Kandee!!! I always have and always will! I love watching your videos and love it when you give such great advice! You may not know it but you help people get by in life every day because you’re such an inspiration!! Thank you for always being your cheerful self! I have you on Snapchat too and I love watching your snaps!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is the worst collection I've seen in my life. Nothing stunning.
I love opening YouTube to see a Kandee video 😄😄 yay!
I don't know why anyone would want to leave you a mean comment. You are the sweetest person with a beautiful heart...a light in this world. Love you Kandee!
Am I tripping or were the highlighters left out except during the bad editing? WTF?
Ok literally what’s with the fake British accent... it seems mocking (I know she doesn’t intend it to be that way probably). But if you were watching a british utuber and they kept doing a fake American accent, that would be annoying too.
but whats in the no peeking box tho
I think the eyeshadows are basically all the same colors, in two palettes. Rip off!
😍The Nice palette is nice😂
Wanna burn some fat? do a jumping jack every time Kandee says: 
"Oooooh"
"Ah!"
"whoah" 
or every word she says in a British accent in this video.
It makes me so mad that people are being so rude to you. I love that you have never changed the way you do your videos. You make me feel like I’m hanging out you while you’re Swatching or doing tutorials. You shouldn’t have to explain yourself about how a video was edited or anything. You’re amazing Kandee!!!
Loving the Naughty palette!!!
I love you Kandee! Thank you so much for taking the time to create videos for us to enjoy. You do this because you love it and you inspired me to want to do tutorials on YouTube as well. Your creativity and talent are so inspiring.  Plus you are just so sweet. When your pallet came out I was so excited and it is one of my favorites!
What is holding me back is the negativity and cruelty by others who are mean just for the sake of being mean. It makes me sad because you take time out of your busy schedule to do these videos and some people just have to criticise. Granted they are entitled to their opinions but I believe that they should be constructive and not for the sake of tearing someone down. I just wanted to leave some love and sprinkle some fairy dust here for you. Thanks again! <3
would've been a great video if it was in focus
Kandee! Love you and all your videos! People are so mean when it comes to the video, and just know that you are amazing at everything you do!
Kandee I love watching your video's. And you are such a beautiful women inside and out. Please don't let hateful people get you don't. Here's a hug from my family to your. Love you
Please do a full face of make-up using the Kylie stuff you got
This vídeo is so amateur, she doesnt even know the kylies velvet formula. I really love the Laura Lee, Jefree Star.... reviews!
girl dont be sad even if people hate u they r just jealous baby
Love your videos kandee. They literally brighten up my day. Who cares if the camera gets out of focus or if the editing isn't the best. Stop with the hate people. She is only human. She's a full time mom who works really hard & just has so much love in her heart for everyone. She never ever says a bad word about people, has always been her cheerful self even when on days life in general gets her down. Why are people being so negative. If you have nothing nice to say then please don't say it atall. Would you say something hateful to someone in person? 
It costs nothing to be nice.

Keep up the videos Kandee, we all love you xx
Kandee I am in love with you! All the negative people out there are just jelouse of all of your amazing talent!  I  am asking for all of your makeup product for Christmas cause thats how much I love you! I hope to mest you one day! Love you lots!!💕💋💕💋
So jelly. You are so beautiful and such an inspiration. Hugs and love
Girl please tilt your camera down or set it up lower, I know you hold up swatches at the end of talking about them but its bugging us when we cant see what youre talking about at the time and we can see you applying but not the makeup
Need and would love to see after Christmas a drugstore foundation recommend/review from you!
Kandee, don’t pay attention to the negative comments. You are amazing and I’ve been watching you for a super long time! You are one of the MAIN reasons why I’m so obsessed with YouTube and makeup in general! You are phenomenal don’t ever forget it! The good out weighs the bad and you have so many more loyal subscribers that truly love and support you. 💕💜
I’d love it all!💕 vlogmas🎄❄️✨🎅
Yes please do vlogmas! I love the kylie nice palette & the lip glosses
Stop with the cringe attempts at an English accent please
Love your vids Kandee, thanks for sharing this. The autofocus issues on this video though.... my eyes hurt!
Love you Kandee for being so committed and editing this in your hotel day before thanksgiving, your such a hard worker and an inspiration to me always. Love you. Your as beautiful as a shining star 🌟 keep shining love ❤️
don't open before christmas opens before Christmas
Kandee - can you do like a Xmas  Advent Calendar of looks or if 25 is too many could you do 12 days of Kandee Xmas. 😊
Her swatches and lightening was terrible....and I use to wonder why her channel fell off
Damn girl this is trending #32 ! Get it kandeee!
Kandee I love you and the amazing heart you have . Don’t ever let the haters and nay sayers ever make you second guess you or your work . Hater talk because you are going something right . You are sweet , kind, loving and inspirational and not many People have that quality. I love you and don’t ever change it second guess yourself ❤️💜❤️💜 YOU ROCK KANDEE JOHNSON!!!!!
I hope the negative comments don't discourage you! Some of them are constructive but ,a lot are just rude. You are one of the kindest souls on this platform and I hope it continues that way! Love you!
AHHH you're back! Love you xxx
Gorgeous, queen <3
Tune out the negative vibrations kandee... there toxic! (Trolls quote) haha love you!!!
Love you 😍😍😍
Oh i would love to see vlogmas from you😘😘
I love it i so wishthe prices was the same in canada
KANDEE. YOU ARE LOVED. YOU ARE AMAZING. PEACE LOVE AND LIGHT TO THE ONES WHO CANT JUST KEEP NEGATIVITY TO THEMSELVES.
I love you Kandee!!! I don’t come to YouTube to watch professionally perfectly edited videos, I come to watch my favorite people talk about things I love! You’re such An amazing person Kandee and I love that you unboxed this on here first! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really love how cute Kandee's hair matches the Kylie Jenner Holiday Collection 💙💚🎄
Kandee I love you so much.
I enjoy your accents, your personality and your efforts and enthusiasm in your videos. Keep on keepin' on Kandee!  P.s. Loving your too faced palette, nail polish and your off shampoo line!
LOVE NEED THIS IN MY COLLECTION PEACE/LOVE 💕💄👄
The editing on this was mental!!
I wish someone would drop me a box too! 😊😁
Kandee, ,Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours! !,,I could give two  squirts about this line,,ill just listen to this gorgeous angel talk and swatch!♡♡ TFS
I love how she got into it right away and didn't blab on like other YouTubers.
Blizzard reminds me of Royal and Twilight from the Huda Desert Dusk palette
This video is a mess
OMG YOUR PFP IS SO CUTE
Love this and love your hair!!!
Don’t listen to the hate. You have the most loving, sweet personality, and you’re only human. Even if the video WAS rushed, which I don’t think it was, you’re a human being with a child, and a life. We love you regardless. ❤️
You have poor video making skills
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. You are so talented & please tell me where you get your energy from?! What I respect most from you is that you're a mom of FOUR (I'm a single mom of 3 BOYS) & you still look 19! Most of all, you are an OG out there still killing the makeup game!

As far as the Kylie Holiday Collection...I NEED THAT WET SET in my life! I LOVE both the lip sets & if I had to pick an eye palette id go with NICE :)
Please god, make it stop!!!!!
Beautiful your so amazing Kandee miss seeing you ♥️you
Everything looks so nice!!!
I LOVE YOU 😘❤️💕
I like how it matches you're hair!!!
Sorry, but the lighting is horrible and everything is so overexposed. Can barely see the colors properly and everything seems so disorganized.
Kandee, I have been watching your videos for years and I absolutely love you. There's always going to be mean comments, people complain about anything. Just know that you have an amazing heart behind all of your work, and I would rather have a person who is 100% genuine with a couple mistakes in a video than a total fake with a perfect video! Nobody is perfect anyway let's be real!! Love you! Keep being you!
What was the small box that said no peeking???
i feel like everything was so rushed and it was just so bright i’m like fraustrated
Please do vlogmas!!!! And some makeup looks using all kylie cos. from her holiday collection

This video is great. I don't understand why you are getting so much hate. Not all youtube videos are perfect.
I just came here to watch a video of you ☺️ the pallet colors as a whole match your hair...anyway have a wonderful Thanksgiving! And you looked beyond stunning at the AIA’s loved both dresses (the second with a mini for Ellie the best though!) love you so so so SO much! 😘😘
YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!! ignore the negative comments! they are just unhappy in their own lives & jealous of your joy. you are fabulous.
Kandee, gf are you alright?
I love you hun ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kandee I love you!!! Don’t listen to the haters!!! This video is amazing and so are you!!!
Kandee Johnson is one of the most kind hearted people i have ever met. She doesnt deserve all the hate yall are giving her! If you dont like the editing of this video thats fine... go watch a different video. But she is amazing and the hate here is unnecessary lets all be friends. 

Youre amazing Kandee and i love you! Keep being you and doing your thing! I appreciate it
I just seen the ad you where in and it was so good great job
Apparently everyone in the comment section is a video critic
Yes Kandee WE WANT TO SEE YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 😍💗😘 VLOG GIRL VLOG😊
Love you Kandee! Really enjoyed the video!
I don't care for the palette colors but I am vibing for the Sugars lip set, it is sold out right now tho
I miss watching Jeffry's reviews
Sad no other YouTube care to review the Kylie holiday collection
Amazing video as always
KANDEE. YOU ARE LOVED. YOU ARE AMAZING. PEACE LOVE AND LIGHT TO THE ONES WHO CANT JUST KEEP NEGATIVITY TO THEMSELVES.
KANDEE. YOU ARE LOVED. YOU ARE AMAZING. PEACE LOVE AND LIGHT TO THE ONES WHO CANT JUST KEEP NEGATIVITY TO THEMSELVES.
KANDEE. YOU ARE LOVED. YOU ARE AMAZING. PEACE LOVE AND LIGHT TO THE ONES WHO CANT JUST KEEP NEGATIVITY TO THEMSELVES.
The English accent kills me. At least I think it's meant to be an English accent 😂 lol
You are like never in my subscription feed anymore... also wish this was a try on.
How come there was a 👎 emoji on the thumbnail? You only had nice things to say about the collection. xo
Wow, those shadows are gorgeous! Very inspiring.
computer hugs! lol love you Kandee!
well it match your hair
Love you Kandee. I love your hair!!!
Couldn't even wait for Thanksgiving to be over. You Millenials don't know what Christmas is about!
Boy I can't wait for Christmas
Your hair is the same color as the collection
Kandee you’re so beautiful and gorgeous so ignore these peoples mean comments 😘😘♥️
Even I want this collection! and I don't wear makeup so often. OMG its so beautiful aaaaaaaaaaaaa O
Do you havé kid ? Ho non you doesn t like you r kid
Love you! Such a wonderful soul!!! ⚠️PEOPLE SHES ONLY HUMAN JUST LIKE US!⚠️ I never comment on videos but so many negative comments to so many YouTubers. She's doing nothing bad but giving us an early insider, and what happens? She gets ugly comments! I just don't get it. No ones twisting your arm to watch the video. Has anyone herd of the saying, "if you don't have nothing nice to say then don't say it at all." Keep having a positive attitude Kandee! 😊
yay for vlogmas!!
Please do vlogmas!!!!!
Hi Kandee just wanted to stop by and say I hope you have a wonderful holiday season! 💖💖
Don’t understand the hate, keep doing your thing Kandee!!
💙💙💙
Never let anyone dull your sparkle ... especially your Christmas sparkle! You are the OG makeup guru who is still kicking booty for a reason.
I love all the colors and Kyle , Matt products, so hard to choice one
Kandee is so inspiring and gorgeous😘
You are such an amazing person inside and out, don't let these rude people who go out of their way to give you a mean comment ruin your day! You are such an inspiration to so many people and especially myself, always know you have a strong following of people who love and support you behind you no matter what!!! I loved the video and look forward to your posts! Keep doing you Kandee <3
I was expecting to see her do the make up tutorial with all those kits
please do vlogmas!!!!
Kandee Johnson I wish you could give me a makeover!!! it's been years since I fix myself and away from family and literally just whatever when it comes to me lol as long as my kids look good I'm okay lol....Help!!!
Your Too Faced ad is adorable! Congratulations!
Kandee you are so sweet and caring i dont know why people have to be so mean to you! Its just a video guys! Its not that serious! Btw kandee you look gorgeous! Hopefully my comment covers the mean ones!
VLOGMASSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
thanks for the video! i was trying to decided on whether I should get the red velvet/velvet lip kit for my friend for christmas---- this really helped me see what it was:) hope you had a good thanksgiving!
YES! Please VLOG for Christmas!  Fun how the naughty pallet matches your hair.  Have a wonderful Thanksgiving with your family.
I love you Kandee!!! 😙💕💕💕
I jus have to say thanks again you weren’t the only who got this but apparently the other people just take it and don’t share information with their subs! And then fixing it again bless you! Still enjoying the kandee pallete but I think I have to do the naughty naughty!
Kandee, I saw some of the mean comments and just wanted to let you know you are the sweetest person on YouTube. Your videos always make me smile and make my day brighter! You lead a great example on YouTube. I only wish I could meet you in person and give you a big hug, and let you know how big of an inspiration you are. Not only through makeup but also your attitude on everything! Thank you so much for making my day and bright and shining one!!!
OMG girl, do vlogmass!!! Please!
You're so cool!
You’re amazing Kandee 😘❤️❤️❤️
Wow. Some of these comments are so mean! Kandee does nothing but promote love & positivity in every video! And she works super hard on keeping up this channel when she has a ton of other things to do! Do any of you realize that she does this YouTube strictly for her fans? It’s not like she has to do it anymore... she is a very popular & busy person & she takes time out to still do these videos for her fans & all she gets in return are rude remarks & destructive criticism?? Wow. 

Kandee,

I love and appreciate you for still taking time to do these videos! You are an inspiration to me! Keep shining bright .... don’t let the haters dull your sparkle!! 💕💕
Kandee, u have too bright lights :(
Ignore all these poor humans. The feelings they are feeling are hate in their own heart for their own life. You're an inspiration and a wonderful person and we all love your videos! ❤️
Yo I really needed that comment she needed at the end of the video! It’s been a hard year😭 but that makes me feel wanted
I feel like she was really digging into the shadows, rubbing hard, to get the pigment.. and it was still patchy and  you couldn’t even see some of the colors well
I vote a big yes for vlogmas!
your hair matching the overall color theme of the collection is so satisfying :3
Please do Vlogmas this year.
Why do you ya e to be sooo mean. Get over yourselves.  To be honest if you don’t like the video oh well.  If you don’t like watching her videos here is an idea just don’t watch them. Kandee you did an amazing job don’t let these immature people get you down.  You are the best.  Keep up the good work.  Love you girl ❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Awww. I love you 💜
Loving the video ur hair is gorgeous
What’s in the box that says no peeking??
Yes,  please blog new stuff all the way up until Christmas. I am not a huge Kylie jenner fan but I like a lot of colors in that gift set and am totally thinking about getting that gift set not only for myself but friends for the holidays.
Love you Kandee!!!!! Screw the haters!!
kandee is rushing to edit and post this its over the place ... but good review :)
Keep doing what you are doing, Kandee! You are such a sweet and encouraging soul! Imagine how hard your heart would have to be to go on someone’s YouTube channel and put mean comments... I️ feel bad that they feel like they can’t just move on with their lives without saying something mean. Keep being your beautiful, sweet self!
‘Velvet’ not ‘liquid color’😩😩😩
I didn’t see anything wrong with this video. People are just hurtful and unkind! I love watching your videos and literally follow you on all of your social medias lol. God has blessed you with an amazing gift so don’t let anyone get you down❤️ Just keep doing you Kandee, cuz you’re awesome!!!
Some of you (most of you) are ridiculously rude. She posted a random video of something she had no idea what it was. Who cares 1. If she doesn’t know Kylie’s formula. She’s supporting Kylie && Kylie is supporting her. She still is helping show everyone the formula. 2. Who cares about the lighting or the way the camera focused. I saw her, I heard her. You saw her , you heard her.
Kandee, I loved this video! i think my favorite eyeshadow palette was the Naughty one, it has more of the colors that I like to use! :) My favorite lipstick kit was the Spice one! I also just wanted to say that I saw all the nasty comments that people have been leaving, and I just want to say that it's a load of crap! It's not your fault that your camera was focusing on your candle, and I think you did a great job with the editing! I'm so sorry that you've been having to deal with such hateful, crappy people, who just need to leave if they don't like the video! It's like my Mama always says, "If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all"! I love you, Kandee! Just put those hateful, nasty people out of your mind, and focus on all of your Subscribers that truly love you! I hope you had a very Blessed, and wonderful Thanksgiving!
Yes, please do videos every day until Christmas...or even after. Haha I love watching you and all the colors were great so it's hard to pick a favorite ❤️ happiest Thanksgiving to you and yours 💋🤗😙
Everybody is so used to these robots and their scripted videos that they can’t appreciate this video. Kandee has been in the game since the beginning, and I love her videos because they’re the way she wants to make them.
Life is short.  Open all of your presents early!  :)   You showed us some pretty goodies!  This is the first time I've been tempted by Kylie products.
In the first 70 Comments!
The top row of shadows is nothing unique , why buy if half of the shades u will have in your collection
Kandee I hope you had an amazing Thanksgiving with your beautiful family. Just remember for every hateful comment, there’s 4x the amount of people who adore you. Your positivity and kindness has spread to so many people throughout the years. I think God put you here for that reason.
Kylie has definitely upped her makeup game. Names of shadow inside palette. Formula and pigment are great. Some really unique shades. I am impressed.
Love you kandeeeee!!!💖💖💖
Yes you look nice as always Kandee!!- But I honestly didn't like any of the Kylie cosmetics...maybe..maybe that nude beige lip matte color?
You are so kind and gracious. Please take your own excellent wisdom and ignore all the hate. I struggle with seeing the good sometimes and then up you’ll pop in one of my feeds and I am reminded there is kindness out there. I’ve met you and hugged you and let’s be honest even a hater leaving a comment is actually still a fan they just can’t admit to themselves. You should have pity for their petty souls 🤗
Honestly,I rlly don't like who ever edited this video at ALL!. I cant see ur face in most of the video,I cant see the palette's color that good😩
Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!
Kandee I just seen your Snapchat and I know you are going through seeing a bunch of rude comments. But remember you are such the sweetest and kindest woman out there and I look up to you all the time. I love your videos. I just watched this video now and I don’t think nothing is wrong with the video at all. Just remember don’t let the haters bring you down remember you have so many girls who look up to you as a great role model. Which I look up to you all the time. Love you Kandee ♥️.
I just wanted to tell you how much my daughter and I love you my daughter meet you at gen beauty and you took the time to take a picture with her she didn’t even have to ask you you just told her to get her camera ready it really meant the world to her thanks for being so nice to her😍
Meh. Got sent here by recommendation... this video is horribly edited. Crappy lighting ... 3 million subs ?????? Beautiful lady anyway! She def needs some hell editing though.
Damn
Warm and.......S P I C Y
Kandee Ik you are looking through the comments knowing half of them are rude just remember that there are so many girls that look up to you as a role model. You are the sweetest and kindest woman I know you can accomplish anything that you put your mind to. Love you Kandee 💕.
Love nice palette, wet set and the sugar lip set
Everyday vlogs please!
Almost to 4M yay 🎉🎉🎉

Your room looks so cute!!!
I love that the pouch matches your hair! 😀
I really love the casual feeling to this video Kandee!! I’ve missed watching these types of videos on YouTube.
VLOGMAS!!!! PWEEEASSEEEE
Hey kandee do you think you could review the new milk makeup holographic quad please thanks ❤
She is terrible at this. She speeds through this, doesn’t know what she’s talking about with the liquid lips and the velvet differences. She doesn’t even she the swatches in the beginning. Wtf
Yay vlogmas!!!
Love all of it. Love you too.
Kandee, I love you no matter what you do! Thank you for posting! I hope people can be more kind in the comments from now on.  The world would be a much better place if everyone was kind like you.
Definitely would buy this collection
damn... was hoping that red velvet was sparkly green liquid lip too Mehhh
please do vlogmas if you can
Anyone else seen that she uploaded it yesterday but deleted it?
Kandee please do vlogmas!!!  I love you so much
Love u Kandee!! Pay no attention to the mean people your awesome 💋💋❤️❤️❤️
Love you kandee ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your not even showing us 😂😂 the camera is so high
Its like the same red ur wearing🤔
I’m so sorry you have to endure such hurtful words from obvious deeply disturbed/unhappy individuals. You inspire all of us daily. No matter my mood, I can watch one of your videos and my day seems to be brightened. I believe your videos are amazing and so helpful. Sometimes things get so crazy and especially if you are as busy as you are, mistakes get made or things get overlooked. It’s not a bad thing, it just proves that you are human. I love you and the content you put out. You are an amazing, kind hearted, loving and the most genuine individual on YouTube. I hope to one day check meeting you off my bucket list. I hope you feel the many hugs and love from all of us!! We love you so much!! Stay strong and know that for every hateful opinion and comment, there are 5-10 times more positive ones! Love you doll face!! ❤️🙏🏼😉💋😘🦄
Kandee you are beautiful and wonderful and so genuine! Forget all the awful comments, they must have needed to feel better about themselves. You just keep doing it your way. There are so many youtubers they can watch. Funny how they take the time to leave ugly comments when all they needed to do was stop watching.
She killed this set, and you confused the velvets and the matte lipstick lol but there still bomb
Love all your videos!
You did it awesome!!! By the way be nice to Kandee! I love you Kandee!! 💕❤️💟💜💋
How is this 14 on trending like 30k views 😑
I need this whole collection so much woah Kylie is always killing it!!
Kandee you are bright and smart and beautiful and kind and human!!! There are so many who love you, so sorry you’re getting so much RIDICULOUS hate! Keep doing what you’re doing, you’re so loved, admired and respected!! Xoxo
Sugar lips and wet set
hey kandee, I know you’ve been getting a lot of rude comments on this video, but I don’t know why. Please try to ignore them. I know it’s hard, but you’re an amazing influencer and I love watching your videos. You are such a wonderful woman, and such an inspiration! I love you & your channel so much. Please don’t let this bring you down. Keep your head up, your supporters will never let you down. We love you, love from WI💘💘
Vlogmas pleasseeeeee 🤗🎄
Look... all you haters need to watch it. Me and the Kandee fam will find you and tell you that there are more important things in life than hating on someone. Kandee is an amazing woman. Everyone had good days and bad days. Every you tuber has phenomenal videos, and videos they rushed through because what’s more important that a video? Your family, your friends, and your health. Around the holidays everyone deserves a little more family time. Be grateful that she got a video up at all. We love you so much Kandee!!! ❤️❤️
I would buy the spice lips!!
I absolutely love your videos you inspire me to be myself and not be afraid of how i like to dress i got your palette and your eyeliner and me and my mom love them both especially the eyeliner hope you had a great thanksgiving I’m thankful for you !!!!!
Yes do more videos pls...also do a favorites video you haven’t done one in a while, love you Kandee :)
Kandee, I love you but what is up with the lighting in this video? I feel like I cannot really see the swatches.
I'm so confused....didnt I watch this yesterday? What happened?
Please give us Blogmas. I can't get enough Kandee!!
Kandee!!!  Love you!!!! And everything you do!!
Yeeesss Vlogmas!!!
I love you 💕
YES BATCH
You ruining your eyeshadow pallets were so hard to watch.
love these vlogs 💙  I want it all 😆
I remember the good ole days when it was just the twinkle light background, grainy videos, the old bathroom.....Kandee is what I know and love. Not what she uses. There's a beautiful person behind the lens and I don't care about the rest. #hereforthelove
Thank you!!!!!!!
She forgot to open one more thing in the box
The colors aren't very festive, except for the red lipstick and 1 green shadow
Love you Kandee!
Love ya Kandee 😊
Im not the only person that just watches these cause there entertaining right?
the review n the whole video is fun, straight to the points, no bullshitting story time whatsoever, but it's the lighting o the brigthness of the camera or video idk, too bright n cant really see the colours on the swatches properly..
Don't open until Christmas lol.
Every time I see one of your uploads, I get so overjoyed and my heart bursts with happiness! As always, you look beautiful, and your video was amazing. I just wanted to add that while I wasn’t able to get the entire collection, I was able to get your “I want Kandee” Palette with Too Faced, and the Melted Ice Cream liquid lipstick. I LOVE adding the melted ice cream to add dimension and mix with my other liquid lipsticks, and the formula of the palette is not only the best formula Too Faced has ever released, its one of the best formulas I’ve ever used! I love it so so so SOOOO much, and I feel so lucky to have it because not only is it amazing, but I️ feel like I have a piece of you In my life everyday! I love you so much, Kandee! ❤️💜💗💋 I cant begin to describe how grateful I am that you are on this earth and able to be such a gift to us all! It would be a dream come true to meet you one day! Until that day comes, know I am sending love from MY heart and House to YOURS! 💗💜
She didnt even mention the power the xbox one x is capable of, it far exceeds the ps4 pro and nintendo switch, im done with you ign
Kandee you shouldn’t have to explain yourself! You are awesome and everybody is hating for no reason! You work so hard to make videos every week & there might be one “off” video but honestly who cares?? I love that half the people commenting don’t even know a thing about how to set up a camera or lighting. You keep doing you & the real ones will support you no matter what!!💗💗 #snapchatfam
Kandee, don’t listen to the negative people or comments about this video! You and your videos are the reason I got really into makeup.
I wo7ld love to get the eyeshadows and the highlights
I wish Kandee tried the lip kit on her lips instead of her arm.
YOUR HAIR 😍
Can y do a look on it😍👑
Your videos make me so happy on my worst days, thanks Kandee! love you!
😍
Just wish the camera was positioned differently. Can’t see much of the swatches.
I wanna see what candy was in the no peeking box
Kandeee you are my idol 😍😍😍 love you so much and your are the one who made me love makeup. I even want to name my daughter oneday kandee😗😗😗
I love u kandee and your videos made me love makeup so much more. You were the first mua I ever watched for a long time. I never even heard of most of these people till recently. I think with youtube cutting peoples pay or whatever some ppl are getting jealous and trying to down others and they just jumped on your mistake. I dont think its that big of a deal they are just ugly people on the inside with nothing better to do. Don't sweat it you are amazing and you can just tell you are sweet inside out.
I love all you videos 😍❤️
Omg uess plz id love ti see some vlogs.. a peak into a truly talented MUA and bc ur just fun ti watch hahaha happy thanksgiving kandee
I love you kandee 💖
Yes please Vlogmas your sparkle makes Christmas less of a empty black hole of pain for me.
this is a mess....
Wouldn’t it be nice if everyone could be supportive of other people?! The comments I am seeing here are hateful and rude. I am all about freedom of speech but maybe kinder words sometimes would be nice. Thank you Kandee for your review you continue to be an inspiration to me!
To those being mean and leaving rude comments: please give her a break. She was probably rushed. It's the holidays. Kandee is such a sweet soul and doesn't need hate spread especially in her video comments. If you want to tell her faults about the video, BE NICE. There's a difference between harsh criticism and just giving her tips and things too try to avoid next time she edits. Give her a break. To those who told her there was something wrong but said it nicely: that's fine. You are telling her the faults and still being nice. That's what I would have done. There's no need to be so mean to her! Everyone has a rough time with editing and she's up till 2 or 3 in the morning editing sometimes. Give her a break! I love you Kandee and I hope these mean comments don't discourage you ❤❤
Kandee,  I don't like the editing here
Why does she sound so ungrateful
I don’t know why people are giving her so much hate. She takes time out of her day to edit these videos and post them on YouTube for you guys. I think she did an amazing job!
Please stop doing the ‘British accent’ thing, it’s very annoying
Love you Kandee! You look beautiful & it’s alright that the camera focus was wacky. I will always appreciate your work. Been a fan since day one. The review is fine.
Kandee's hair is GOALS ♥️♥️♥️
I love how you call the different colors/products “he.” It’s so cute! 🤣 You’re soooo sweet and I also love how you talk in random accents!
Those liquid lipstick look awesome.
KANDEE, you are so phenomenal and amazing, these people coming in here writing horrible things are jerks. They take time out of their day to make other people feel as bad as they do. I’m willing to spend time out of my day so you know how amazing and talented you are. On top of that you are so sweet, when i met you last week at the meet and greet in Temecula the first thing i did when i left was call my sister and blurt out, “omg she’s so nice 😩 like actually amazingly nice” you are kind and do not deserve this negativity. Know your worth. Hope you have a better day and treat yourself to something delicious!
Hey Kandee rocking the blue hair it really suits you! I know this video has been getting a lot of mean comments but those comments aren’t worth the tears nor time. I follow you on snapchat and from what i can see you are kind funny and always encourage people to be the best they can be and rise up above the hate and destructive comments. Therefore I’m firing your own advice right back at you- don’t let hater tear you down rise above them and remember there are always those around you that love you and will support you! Stay rocking girl! Xx - Baleigh
So.....what is your opinion of the products?  Do the eyeshadows flake?
Yes VLOGMAS!!!! 👏👏👏
Kandee love you forever...them some ugly haters with ugly hearts! Don’t let them ruin your beautiful spirit.
https://statestemporium.myshopify.com/search?type=product&q=kylie
I LOVE YOU!!! 💕💕💕💕💕
Kandee is a very sweet talented woman. all you need to drop the attitude! sheesh, people don't upload vids to get criticism, they do it to get praise for their hard work and talents. People in this world nowadays are egotistical bastards.
I don't understand why everyone is upset with this video! For me it's fine (it could be a little better because Kandee's video are always on point but ok). I have a beauty blog and I know how much hard work you have to do so before you will be jugdemental and mean think if you would do it better! Kandee you are my sweet and positive cherrypie so don't let anybody to make you feel bad! Love you 😚
The hair is amazing and as you know, you are stupidly, unbelievably beautiful- inside and out!
Your lights are too bright hun, you can't see the makeup that well xo
Kandee you do the very best unboxing videos!!! Do them more often.
Kandee, Gods got you! Don’t think about the hate comments because He’s letting you shine for a reason! Everyone can see your beautiful loving character and some people just can’t handle it...but you know what? You’ve planted a seed in them (you know where I’m going with this 😉 ) Let your love shine and you do you! Do your impromptu vids if YOU want! It’s obviously working 😆 Even if it means so much hate. You’re reaching people and showing them what a genuine, loving, forgiving, passionate Christian looks like! xoxo 😘 Keeping shining! ✨💖
What’s in the box that says no peeking
Is it just me or is she talking faster than other videos??
What makes those colors naughty and those ones nice?... I don't understand her choices lol
I love this video and I love you kandee
What is in the no peaking thing?
People complaining must have never watched an unboxing before!  Hello... An unboxing is supposed to be impromptu. Therefore this is REAL life in REAL time & if her camera wasn't focusing perfectly, how exactly is that her fault?!?   Haters gonna hate... They are obviously not a part of the Kandee family, then!  Y'all need to find something better to do with your time!   #kandeefam4life   💖  We love you, Kandee!!!
I'm v confused, sometimes you have an American accent, but at other times you have an English accent. Can anyone verify?
Please do Vlogmass!!
all of you who left comments does it make you feel good that you made this poor woman cry?? she rushed doing this video so we could see the kylie collection ASAP for her viewers. so cut her some slack and be nice. come on. be decent.
Who's your hair color by?!
British accents tooo fuuny
I wasn’t planning on getting anything but I think I might get the nice palette now, it’s sooo pretty
I havent watched Kandee in forever and i come back and her hair is tourquise emm
Kandee! I am always so happy to when you’ve posted a new video! Your positivity and infectious, bubbly delivery and personality always make me smile. Those negative disrespectful commenters are ridiculously ignorant. I never am going to understand the need for strangers behind a computer screen feel it’s ok to say the things that they do. Your fans, friends and family recognize and know you’re awesome and love you!😘
Awww love u kandee!! ❤️❤️❤️
Why does she say noorgty it sounds so funny 😂😂 not hate just think it’s funny. 😊😂
I want the Kylie  bag💜💜💜
Both eyeshadow pallets look the same??????
Amazing! :)
I only watched because the gift set looked awesome ... and I’m not a a fan xD but I’d love the xmas collection
We LOOOVE you Kandee ! Don't listen to these morons who are critiquing you...like THEY know anything.   Hugs   xo
This video is sooooo bad
I can’t find this on her webisite?? Is it officially up??
I’m so happy you spoke out about people being so mean. You are amazing and so positive. Who cares if you’re rushed and excited. Who cares what quality your camera is when you are just trying to help us to see a launch as soon as you can when you’re so busy! People need to appreciate your efforts to get things up when we all are busy and trying to manage life in general with the holidays and making sure to be with family. You’re the best. Don’t forget that you are loved by so many and negative people need to realize they should just keep their mouths shut. Thank you for not deleting the video or taking away the comments because I pray that your followers built you up and helped with the negativity
Whatttt is going on with everyone with the mean comments?? Can't you just be nice and greatful :) she is so talented and hardworking, give a girl a break! sheesh
She does no know how you take care of makeup bruh
Please don’t listen the hateful

To everyone leaving rude, critical comments about this video,

Have you ever tried doing what she does? It's super hard work and she does her best while still being a super mom to her four kids and doing what she needs to for her family. She doesn't make videos to please us, and she has said time and time again that she started YouTube because she wanted to show her extensive knowledge about something she is passionate about. If you're going to critique her video, at least give her ways of improving instead of just berating and belittling her. This is ridiculous. If you don't like it, don't watch it. Simple as that. Spread love, not hate. If there's one message Kandee has left through her channel, it's that kindness matters more than anything. So unless you yourself have spent hours slaving over computers and cameras trying to edit and put out a video you personally feel passionate about, you have no right to comment about how she's not doing things right. You've not been in her place and, therefore, you cannot accurately judge her, not that you should in the first place. Constructive criticism is a thing, but some of you really need to learn how to do that. Some examples are "I really enjoyed your video. However, the lighting was a little too saturated. Maybe that's something you could work on in the future." There is absolutely no need for all this hate and all these awful comments over a video. Love is louder than the pressure to be perfect. Kandee, keep doing you, girl! You're amazing the way you are! Don't let the negativity affect your passion and drive to succeed! ❤
Im too broke 😂😂😂
love you kandee 😘😘😘😘😘😘
Kandee!!  I love your hair!
you remind me of the grinch horrible green hair red lips girl huh huh 😩👎👎
Love the shadows!
Me everytime I get new makeup
😍😘👍
Love you Kandee, you bring so much joy and sparkle to Youtube <3
Could you do some tutorial's on these 2 palette's? I wear your  palette like almost everyday but I might consider getting one of these! I have 2 (because I love it so much) Freshly Baked Matte Lipgloss's, are Kylie's Matte lipgloss feel as comfortable and long wearing as yours does?
I'm sorry kandee, I'm not a fan of your hair..I loved your hair when it was bronette though..
I love you Kandee 💖💖
Where did you get the Holiday Set
I'm a pigment an blendablilty girl. A lot of those darker eyeshadow didn't look like they were blending that great an the only lip color that really wowed me was the bright red an liner. I really liked the green in the naughty palette too I could definitely see myself wearing that frequently.
Wow i didnt even read all the comments and hate me all you want but some of you are rude. True fans know how sweet and amazing she is as a person and would never say anything rude to anyone and here "fans" are just putting her down. I love you kandee you do amazing videos and are always such an amazing happy sweet person who doesnt deserve all this hate
I love you Kandee! You are the OG of YouTube! Don’t ever change!
Yesss Vlogmas!!!
First of all... I think you are a wonderful person! Just for feedbacks sake.... videos have been feeling very erratic for a while. I love that you're real, but videos feel very rushed and could probably use more editing. I couldn't really see the items or the colors properly. So you could probably no actually show us you putting them on your arm and just do that off camera and then show us all the swatches compared the the actual pallet they way you do?. I feel like maybe you try to finish the filming quickly and it comes across in the videos, even after editing! I know you are super busy, and I appreciate you taking your time to still connect with your audience.
What hair dye did you use?
What is in that white box says no peeking
Beautiful as always Kandee. Sad to see all of the hateful comments. If only they knew, you are one of the kindest people on YouTube!!! Ignore the hate and soak in the love! <3
I just love her so much!
LMAO, I was hoping it was going to be sparkly green too. I bought red velvet, but I thought that was the color name! I didn't realize that it wasn't matte :(
Kandee, I know you’ll probably not see this but I wanted to let you know that I have been watching you ever since your T-shirt cutting tutorials. So, for a while now. I love how much you have grown as a YouTuber and a makeup artist. You were my first makeup YouTube artist I followed and learned from. Don’t let any of these negative comments hurt your beautiful soul. You have the most sparkly and kind personality and heart.
SAVAGE!
Please do a makeup look with all her makeup
Ya, most of these kinda were hickey colors lolol
Your the Best!!!!!!!
Hi
I love your hair!!!! 😍😍😍
I wish the nice assorted box with the wet set is actually what we could get as customers... but it’s not.   If you order the Christmas collection it does Not come with the wet set, and it all comes jumbled in a small box...  just sayin
Does anyone know of good dupes for the Naughty & Nice palettes?
Vlogmas!!!!!! Yes please!
First time watching you and didn't like this video. I wish you would of swatched the lipstick on your lips, Seems like you were too over hyped and didn't give much info other than swatches and saying its nice?
Kandee you are amazing. I’ve been watching your videos ever since you started. You’re always so uplifting and whenever I️ have a bad day, I️ watch your videos and instantly I️ feel better 💗 sending lots of love! Love always wins.
Beautiful 👍👍👍👍😍
How could you give Kandee so much hate when she is the sweetest person ever! Give the girl a break and just click off if it's not your taste!
Stop with the rude comments. If it were you on here making YouTube videos and someone said some crap like that I’m sure you’d be upset. It’s ridiculous how rude some people are these days.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yes to vlogmas
Ugh I want it all!!
I love how you share every detail with your fans!! Love you Kandee!
First watching her video. And she sounds like having 2 different accents. Mostly she did American but the britsh I can heard that.
LOVEEEE your hair
Love it!!!
“I want to eat it “🤣
Vlogmas!!! 🎄🎁⛄
Why a thumbs down?
Yea vlogmas
ILY KANDEE😍
Kandee you are such an amazing artist and such an inspiration for so many people. Don’t let some awful people ruin your amazing spirit. You’re a pure joy to listen to and I dream of being as good of a makeup artist as you some day!
Camera angle is awful lol
Dear Kandee Johnson. I don’t like to leave comments but I got to say that watching your Snapchat motivated me to. I have been a fan from years. You taught me not only to use makeup but to see the good in everything. Love you kandee. Please don’t read the negativity. Just focus on the positive.
Happy Thanksgiving Kandee I love this video you are amazing!!! And it’s the holidays. So if you don’t have anything nice to say then don’t comment. You guys are so mean!! Leave her alone she’s awesome and you guys who committed badly sux!!!
Kandee has is the sweetest person, why is she getting so many rude comments? Please let’s try to spread positivity because we all know someone who needs it right now!
Im more worried  these people came to your HOUSE while momma Kandee was there alone .That's weird . Every heard of UPS Kylie ...
Ew don't listen or even read the nasty comments! People are just jealous and bitter..note to haters of you don't like the video..move on!! There is no need to leave the comments that have been made it is never ever ever ok to say things like that to anybody!
I'd love to see videos of beauty gift ideas at different price points. Also I think it would be funny to do a makeup tutorial for a look that would go good with an ugly Christmas sweater. Maybe a joke or maybe how to look great even though your wearing a terrible sweater.
You’re like out of frame half the time ...
Kandee! Please Vlog and do a Christmas tour again!
Vlogmas!!!!
You're trending Kandee!!! YAY!
People should stop being so mean in the comments kandee is really nice and there is no reason to be rude. ❤️
Throw it away
Yay it’s backkk!
You are soo adorable Kandee, I just love you 💗💗💗
I actually really loved the whole collection and that's a first for me...I swear I am sooo jealous off that big box 📦 off makeup goodies...I can't afford too buy any off it, but I love makeup so very much, so by watching you unboxing it and get exited, I can imagine how wonderful it must feel💗💗I'm sooooo exited for vlogmas 🎅🏼🤶🏼🎄🎁🍫🍎🦃🎶🍬❤️✨hohoho
PLEASE VLOG!! LOVE YOU!
Ilysm 😭❤️
Haha i dont mind that its like she didnt take time to edit it. If it was anyone else i would have been annoyed but kandee is too lovable i still watched the whole thing. Shes a mom guys nikkietutorials isnt give the gal a break
Vlogmas!!
Vlogmas!!
Beautiful💖💖💖💖
Here's my question ... Why does the couple reviews of this box completely miss the no peeking box... Unless told to leave it out. They don't even acknowledge it's there ... So just wondering ..
The light sucks !!!!!! I can t even see the colors of the eyeshadow palette!!!
Kandee I want you to vlog. I only have YouTube so I really want to see you celebrating Christmas
Who gives a $hit if she gets hate. Welcome to Youtube. All people do is hate and flag your videos. We're all subjected to this, why shouldn't she be as well.  This video is just an infomercial for makeup anyway..
So her camera didn't focus properly...  Oh no..... How am I ever going to figure out how to apply makeup.... 
Youtube's Trending videos are a joke anyway....  Think of the Trending videos as the annoying commercials that you need to watch before you get back to what you really want to watch....
Second
😍😍😍😍😍💝💝💝💝💝💝
Very Nice! ... Enjoy!
Nice collection :)
The blue&green shadow matched your hair :)  Are you still with Michael ?
Naughty eyeshadows
Why was this deleted at first ?
I’m jealous
Don’t listen to the negative people kandee! Keep your sparkle and shine
The video?
My goodness people, hating on others just to spit hatred is disgusting. Someone who gives nothing but joy, love , and inspiration, and all you all can do is add to the heartache and pain in this world that is destroying lives. Shame on you! Just shows how black your heart is, maybe try a Little Love and it will change the way you feel and your heart might start to warm and you can start making an impression for good.
Cute video hunny
I love to watch your videos while I’m working bc it’s positive and fun but it gives me horrible anxiety just waiting for the next time you’re going to put on a fake British accent. I just can’t. I don’t get it :(
PLEASE stop with the attempt at (what i'm guessing was meant to be) a British accent it made me cringe so much 😣
❤️💖❤️💖❤️
I’m watching this with my little sister and she says she likes your hair! 😻❤️😻❤️
Vlogmas!!!!!
Her lights are so bright I can’t see shit
🍬💋🍬👄🍬💋🍬👄🍬💋🍬👄🍬❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Kandee beats any youtuber any second of the day in all the years she's been alive. Not only is she the OG, she is super talented and built herself from the ground UP. She is not only an amazing makeup artist that can do simple makeup, glam makeup, makeovers, but she can do character makeup like nobody's business. She is decent, doesn't have  a snotty or vicious bone in her body or snotty or vicious word in her vocabulary, she is REAL and isn't grotesquely vial like JS, and so many other YTubers out there, but she has built her brand from the ground up while raising 4 beautiful children as a single mama. Does anyone know what it's like to be a single mama? I do and it is no small measly task. We need MORE KANDEE'S in the world all day eraday because she is a light in the darkness of crazy perverted youtubers and Youtube watchers. I've watched her from the first video she's ever made on how to clean makeup brushes, she never curses, she has never been "plastic", she doesn't bash on anyone EVER, she does nothing but encourage encourage encourage and wants everyone to feel loved "more than they know" and she is not worthy of one single negative comment for this video. She's never stooped to the lowest of human indecency like so many other YTubers,, and she loves God (the best thing about her). So freaking what about the editing or whatever...it's just makeup and swatching. So many negative Nancy's in the world, y'all need therapy. I absolutely adore and ❤❤❤❤❤ you so much @kandeeJohnson you're the real deal mama!
The purple lizard colour looks very similar to buzz from naked 3 pallet
Vlogmas
Yasssss!!! VLOG MAS YASSS!🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁🎄🎁
anyone who is mean doesn't realize how hard it is to edit YouTube and how much time and effort goes into videos. Unless any of you can do better I wouldn't judge her. Okay so what the camera accidentally went out of focus you can still see what the colors are! She's trying okay and her videos aren't usually blurry and you're lucky people like her even do this or you wouldn't be able to know what you're really buying. Negative people will never make it in this world bringing others down believe it or not. You're doing great kandee congrats on kylie reposting your video. Haters back off
Hey haters! Kandee is amazing! She’s beautiful inside and out! If you don’t like the video then don’t watch it. And telling someone to kill their self is so horrible. Please don’t be a bully! Maybe you should watch more Kandee videos so you can see how to spread love instead of hate. Love you, Kandee!
Can you slow down?! Seems like you were rushing through it all
Did anyone else notice that the naughty and nice boxes are Slytherin colors?
That kits fake!!!! You can tell by the bag that’s the big giveaway it’s supposed to be leather not a fabric
Obsessed
kandee, I hope that all the loving and positive comments can drown out the hate.  As someone who has been watching your videos for years and didn't just click on this video because it was trending I have to say that your "imperfections" in filming/editing have always been part of what I loved about you.  It is what makes you so relatable and real.  You feel like someone I could be friends with in real life and when i watch your videos i feel like I'm sitting with a friend talking about something we both love like makeup.  Hopefully that makes sense.  I am so sorry that you are getting such mean comments but please never change who you are.  Your beautiful soul and down-to-earth personality is what the world needs right now! Love from a long time viewer!!
I wish the makeup we ordered and paid for was as good as the versions they send out to you guys. It's really getting ridiculous how every makeup guru who gets Kylie cosmetics for free says its great and it looks great on camera, but everyone who pays for it themselves because they were blacklisted by kylie or because they aren't as popular have horrible results. Every item I have bought myself has still been that same ol' cheap ass colourpop formula. I don't know. I just wish Kandee and other artists that I respect so much wouldn't fall in this rabbit hole. You don't have to kiss those jenners/kardashians asses.
This was a horrible review 
:-/

focusing issues are so annoying
VELVET MATTE
Hi beautiful! Please do not give even one second of your energy to all these hurtful jerks on here. They are just jealous of your success. There have been days that I’ve had that we’re just the worst and then I would open my Snapchat and they you were with your positive messages and big smile to make all the difference to me. For every person being nasty below....Shame on you! Take your mean self somewhere else. Huge 💟 to you Kandee
Naughty or nice??
Just a few days ago I was just telling Bailey Sarian how sad it is that there's so many hurtful, cruel, & judgmental people in our world. Why does one feel it's ok to hurt another? Bullying is unacceptable at any age. Why couldn't they use all that wasted negative energy onto something more genuine & kind, like taking time out to help one another, put a smile on another persons face that may actually be having a really bad day. We need more peace & harmony, tears of joy, not tears of sadness. Hugs to you and anyone who reads this <3
Totally in to the naughty palette but girl I'm in LOVE with your NAILS!!!
Kandee, I’m so sorry for all of the rude and hateful people that have been commenting. People today think that they can sit behind a screen and say whatever they want no matter how hurtful. Don’t let the hateful words hurt you. You are so sweet and spread so much love and kindness into the world. You make me smile daily with your sweet words on Snapchat. Put your arms around yourself and give your self a big hug from me to you!
.
Was it not just thanksgiving in the states ? (I’m from Canada ) and shouldn’t we be thankful for the amazing makeup artists like kandee instead of judging her. I’ve learned so much from her. I’ll never understand why people who “hate” kandee and don’t like watching her videos ... why they watch the videos in the first place ? And even go as far as commenting on the videos. You must not hate her that much if you take time out of your day to watch her videos! Grow up people
Yaasss
Love
VELVET MATTES
AH, be a gruesome surgical nightmare? Who wants to look like a man who had his private parts cut up and thinks he is a woman? If you do, you need psychological help. Bruce Jenner was betrayed by society and everyone who loved him (evidently no one).
Super gay
Great colors!
Nice
When you’re doing God’s will the devil tries to bring you down because he feeds on negativity. Never let the darkness of the world dim your light, Kandee. You’re truly an inspiration to so many people, there are days when I still watch your “Bad Day Video” when I need a pick me up. Always stay true to who you are and never let the world change you. I love you, keep up the good work!
Im so mad that this is sold out
Oh my dearest Kandee, I can't believe ANYONE would put it in their hearts to be  mean to one of the most BEAUTIFUL souls I've ever seen and recently got to meet!!! I know you meet a ton of people, but I just recently met you at Temecula at the Ulta, and to meet you in person and just feel your love and see your shining face was more than a dream come true! You seriously OOZE love in person and regardless of all your hardships you prevail and have become stronger and more beautiful! I know its hard sometimes, but forget the mean comments, forget the haters... they have nothing negative to say because of their own misery! I love you Kandee!!  Keep staying true and beautiful!! Praying for you always! XO - XO - XO

This is fake
Firsttt
Doesn’t she edit/cut her videos? Hahahahaha
I am so disappointed... such a bad quality video... she's in a hurry and i cant even see the swatches properly. I suggest do it again.
Was hoping you were gonna do an eyeshadow look, so that we could see if they blended well or if they were pigmented using a brush. Kinda disappointed because Kylie already swatched everything. Also editing was really weird. Felt rushed and very poorly put together. :/
The camera angle is awful in this video!
Who’s Kylie? Only make up genius I know is Rihanna.
As a mama of 6, I don’t have a lot of time on my hands.... but when you upload, I make sure I make time to watch. It saddens me that people take time out of there day to be mean and negative. It must be miserable to walk around with so much negativity in your heart. Kandee, you are amazing... I can’t imagine anyone could fine a truly nasty thing to say that is actually true. Hugs and love from my house to yours, especially since you send so many to my house xo
Who clicked because it was on the trending page
This is fake because it just came out and it couldn’t be ordered in hour
I wish you would’ve actually created a look rather than show us just the swatches, you can find that anywhere
I don't know why the camera kept zooming in and out, blurry and clear but it was definitely hard to watch. Love the video but it seemed like half the swatches were out of frame and blurry. I love you I'm sorry to complain. This one was hard to watch though.
I can only see your freaking Wall
He just a gloss ...13:17 WTF?!😳😨

Edit
  The collection is pretty but your video is a mess girl
Haters....Seriously? What the heck is wrong with you people?? Kandee you have to be the sweetest person in the world, don't let these people make you feel different. I don't believe in being mean back, but wow. The fact that you have time to film and edit is amazing Kandee, and we would still watch if you shot the whole vid upside down? One question......(since I do love editing) Final Cut or Adobe Premiere?
The red velvet lip kit is a velvet formula, thats why it didnt stay on. Same goes for the shade savage. The shade angel stayed on pretty well because it was matte. You need to know the difference.
Did no one notice that on the press powder pallet that the darkest shade looks already used .... and the eyeshadow ...
Tbh it was kind of annoying that during this entire video you were spontaneously switching from speaking in your normal Amercian accent, in to a very bad might I add, fake British accent. As someone that lives in the UK I found this not only annoying (As there was no reason in the video for her to be doing so in the first place , Kylie is American I'm assuming?) but I also found it a little bit offensive if I'm being honest.
her makeup looks horrible
I thought you weren’t supposed to open it
THOT
Anything or anyone who thinks Kardashian’s are relevant or worthy of attention is why trump will be president for 7 more years 🖕🏻😂 liberals are such trash
She's not in frame, shes not in focus and the swatches are terrible it looks like you did this super fast and weren't trying your best
Are you talking to yourself.!  Stupid
Happy Thanksgiving Kandee!! Love you! -Brittany from Htown
You’re not even in the video. You’re off to the side trying to stick your neck in the video. So annoying.
Awful review of Kylie holiday collection !!!! 😡👎🏻🚮
тварь безмозглая
This video was so all over the place and seemed so rushed. Couldnt even finish it . Sorry .
these videos make me want to kick random children on the street
Her review is better than nicol concilio ( nicole looks stupid while reviewing the collection )
this is really professional
Intro - the acting was horrible
I cant even with that damn focus! Stop moving woman! The camera can't keep up!
....wished you’d relax a bit and focus the camera on the swatches
OMG I've never hit the dislike button ever till now. For someone to be in the beauty community game for a while, I would think your swatches would be 150% better then what I just watched. This video was just all over the place, and I was quite shocked I watched the whole thing. I was just waiting for you to get the eye shadows and lip swatches all over your white top. As a positive note, the collection looks quite beautiful. WOW! Definitely got to get my hands on some items.
Only here to dislike
Excuse me... Ellie is 6??? WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN!? I remember when she was born!! Love this so much.

Wow! Did Ellie really do that without a reference photo? Even with one, what a remarkably good job! That girl is a real artist. And what a personality!  Definitely a huge YouTube star in the making.

It's so surreal to see Ellie is already a 6-year-old.  The reason I created a YouTube account was so that I could subscribe to your channel.  You were the first person I subscribed to and that was before Ellie!  Now I have to go and find the video where Ellie was singing Let it Go.  That was THE BEST!!!
Ok so can I have her😩she’s too cute

KANDEE!!! You have to do more transformations. It's your thing. You are such an artist!
WOW, this was an AMAZING transformation & 110% accurately done!!! You are truly soooooooo talented, skillful, artistic, creative, inspiring, beautiful (inside & out), with such an endearing/loveable personality!!! I’ve been watching your videos for so so long, and you’ve always been so true & honest to who you are, and have not changed for anyone or anything’s sake; such an inspiration, in my eyes and to the world, obviously!! 💕
Kandee you are getting way too good at this!! sending all my love and support always!!! All the way from Atlantic City
If I didn't know better, I would have thought you'd transformed a man into John Snow.
How could anyone thumbs down your amazing work ugh. This is so awesome
How about the witch of the East from Wizard of OZ, although Glenda or even Dorothy would be awesome!!!  Thanks for being so very down to earth !  ❤️
This is AMAZING. Pure TALENT!
'' You are a good makeup artist ''

'' You are a good person Kandee ''

You just said that to someone who left her childs for day on a dirty appartment
John snow always looks concerned, but in a ridiculously good looking way 👌
Yasssss girl, this is amazing 👌 xx
What is the background song called?
Is this supposed to be Leonardo DiCaprio from The Revenant? So cool!!
Hannah's eyes are SO PRETTY
You missed a golden opportunity to say, you know nothing John snow.
It's just me or in the first 1 minute she kinda look like older version of Justin Bieber lol
Come to Orlando and transform Ruth into you! Hoping you can do a review comparing lip plumpers! So many still doing injections. ♥️ Love watching your videos and snaps! x ~ Joanna
I have no idea who that guy is, but wow....Hanna looks nothing like herself by the end.
Kandee you really are a delight, a lovely person and so beautiful inside and out!!
They tip-toed around that "you know nothing" real smooth.
wooowww
I also do not watch GOT (I don't support that level of violence in film), but my husband does, so I hear about the characters. As always, you are amazing, Kandee!
Hi KandeeJ!! I Love You Bunches and Bunches! I hope you're doing great!!
YASSS  Kandee Jon Snow is quaking in his grave that he rose from
Really amazing transformation!
Seriously the talent Kandee has is just unreal. UGH loved you since the beginning girlie and will continue to support you and your channel. ;)
Love you kandee ur such a talent and so inspiring
Kandee you are amazing.  And Hannah -- you are the so sweet.  Love you ladies.
I love when you changed woman in man.
Hannah is so pretty .. and looks hot as a guy too! lol. Awesome job Kandee. Love your transformation videos. You're amazing xx ps. You should really watch Game of Thrones. It's soooo good! :)
I LOVE Go t and Kandee too!!!
Oh my gosh, I'm so attracted to Hannah right now! It's like she is a cross between Jared Leto and Kit Harrington!
I have so much respect for makeup people lol. It's such an art
☹️😢I miss game of thrones
haha! Hannah missed a perfectly good chance to say "You know Nuffin" 4:32
So this is or was the secret project Kandee was doing right after her colab came out with Too Faced she was filming and working so hard..she always have and does..this is so amazing ..Kandee is such a awesome makeup artist
WATCH GAME OF THRONES!!!!!!!!!!!😘
She looks so good!!! Kandee you are the best xD
Amazing!
Yay for never seeing Game of Thrones! Me either! I don't care to, but love watching your transformations!
Hannah looks like schieffer bates
Good job. Not quite Jon snow though.
Happy to watch you work at transformations again
Wait...when did Jared Leto get there? 😂
OMG this really is so good!
I got mine from Walgreens in Philadelphia
That intro I.C.O.N.I.C.
I don't watch GOT but holy moly that was great!
Fantastic as usual Kandee! xoxo Mary
It was a great transformation.. loved it.. but I'm afraid Jared Leto does not play Jon Snow... it's Kit Harrington...
I love watching you Kandee! You are soooo talented and radiate such positivity!
She's just amazing!
"I just see Jon Snow" hahahhaaaa:D:D
Harto has some beautiful lashes 😍
really really miss your regular makeup tutorials for all of us girls 😢😢😢i mean we’re not gonna be turning ourselves into a man ever☹️no more guy videos!!!!! lol
tbh at first scrolling I thought this was a post malone transformation
I fangirled way too hard at this. Really great transformation into the one and only Jon Snow
Because of her face shape and lips. It looks like Littlefinger pretending to be Jon Snow😅
Yoooo this is so dope. I don't do much male makeup, and not gonna lie. This helps so much n.n
I wish you explained what you did step by step so we could recreate
I LOVE KANDEE
You should transform her into Marvels Loki, she has the face for it and you're one heck of an artist like
Um...but she looks hotter than Jon Snow.
Wow I'm here for this one love it!
ALWAYS slaying the transformations! I've been a Kandee fandee from the OG days!! I love ya s'much! I feel like you're that long lost family member that I haven't met yet!!! LLLLLLLLOOOOOVVVVEEEE YOU KANDEE! *******OHHH and I just got my Kandee eyeshadow palette and I love it s'much!! smells so good! I don't know what I'm doing with it yet because I'm not great at applying eye makeup! hahahahaha
OMG DUBJDFIWC
I love me some Jon Snow and GOT. Good job
Oooooooooooo wow. You best one.

Queen Kandee you amaze me 🙌🏼
It looks more like she was turned into Sawyer Hartman than John snow but still an amazing job!
HEY KANDEE!!
Lol at the snowing! Don’t feel bad I’ve never seen the show either🎃
This is AMAZINGGGGG
Please do a Kriti Sonan and sheriya rai look. They're bollywood actresses and no one can depict their looks better than you I'm sure
Kandee, that was so good I couldn't decide who was the real real!!!!!
This is amazing!!
First
I miss when you would do make up on Ellie for a bunch of different halloween costumes. i loved that series!
You’re truly AMAZZZZZZIIIIING!!! Thank you for sharing your talent and your beautiful light with the World, Kandee! 🌸 xoxo
Before you put the beard on her, she totally looks like Tom Felton  (Draco Malfoy) two looks in one, go Kandee 💕
The only criticism I could make is that the highlights are just white instead of matching the undertones of the foundation. But I'm not an artist and couldn't do it better if I wanted to.
This is amazing.
What a handsome manwoman
Check out desio (or desioeyes) on instagram for amazing contacts. They’re specifically designed to work on dark coloured eyes but work awesome on any colour and look super natural if you go for the more regular tones or you can get bright grey for example which is killer, too!
Please transform yourself into Cersei! I feel like you look a lot like her!
Kandeeeeeee what brand are the gray  lace up platform  boots you posted on Snapchat not that long  ago???
Hi my name is Hailey. My dad is friends with bobby. You know who that is. Lol anyways just wanted to say I love you and I really hope I get to meet you someday.
Winter is coming ❄️
That's amazing! I subscribed to you would you plz do the same????????????????????????
turn her into the joker from suicide squad (jarred leto)
she looks like Hal from riverdale
Hannah makes really hot boy...
Well she doesn't look like John snow however she definitely looks like a man.
I’ve never seen Game of Thrones either. I don’t have that channel 😕
kandee looks beatiful without makeup
Kandee this is incredible!!!
I look like what would happen if Jon Snow and Sam had a baby together, and said baby went bald...
No matter who she tries to transform into she still looks like Jared Leto.
she looks like MaxNoSleeves lol
I wish you would stop speeding the videos up, and do it like you used to and explain everything youre doing. I miss the old kandee videos.
You killed it!!!!
Oh look its Killian!....Captain Hook....Once Upon A Time....no...anyone? Lol
OMG!!! Hahahahaahahaha
You’re daughter should make a YouTube channel ! She is to cute
Amazing 😱😱👍🏻👍🏻
Spot on
why does hannah look sooo great like this lmaooo
this was amazingg
Oh my gosh you guys are the cutest
amazing!
Brown contacts!
So OK,  I really wanna know.... I'm an artist and I like to work with oil paints and my style is hyper realism. I see you looking at something during your tutorials and I assume it's a reference picture so.... does it matter what the shape of the face you are working on is or can you do any look on any face? Is it just like a blank 3D canvas that you ad shade and light to in the exact areas of your reference picture? I mean of course I know that you can alter the appearance of any feature to look rounder, skinnier or more angular but there are some things that you can't change like spacing of eyes nose and mouth. How do you get around that? Or is there some tricks for that as well? You are amazing, your very talented and I want to congratulate you on your makeup launch, very cool!
Seriously? You turned her into a man whose even more handsome than Jon Snow!
Woghh!!
try to do the night king (game of thrones )
GAME OF THRONES...............YES. #motherofdragons #kaleesi👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐👐

I love you Kandee so much that I’m not even disappointed that you haven’t watched GoT!! You really would enjoy it I think!  You did an AWESOME JOB with the Jon Snow transformation and he would be even hotter with blue eyes!! 🎃🎃❤️

Wow!
Hot
Halloween is the time that beauty gurus come out of their shell

Wow
Maybe that guy thought you were your sister's daughter because you dress like a teenager and you color your hair all kind of wacky colors like a teenager. Your sister looks  the total opposite of that.

1 second ago  SORRY.....TRYING TO GRAB YOUR MERCIFUL ATTENTION !!!!!!!
Hola Kandee!  You are insanely gorgeous and soon humble about it!  Love!  I've been away from the cosmetic scene for about 10 years, meaning I've not evolved and kept on newest trends and techniques.  I'm 39 (whaaa whaaa, boohoo!).  I'm getting married for FIRST time next May and am looking of a youtube video/personality that can instruct me on a sultry eye look and flawless skin (I have pale to light olive colored skin). I have a very long face, large forehead and slight acne scars on cheeks...(I know, I'm a monster :)~  I'm not are if I should commit to someone air brushing me or try to do my own specific foundation. My eyes are brown and every video I see jumps to the standard rose like shadow in the corner of the eye with some type of bronze or rose shimmer in corner and highlight of lid. Problem is...., EVERYTHING i've read SAYS to not use shimmery eyeshadow on mature lids as its not complimentary.  I do not real like pinks or purples on my lids....feeling like they make me look sickly and bring redness out in my eyes, and i'm paranoid about being too old to shimmer :(.  If you read this and have any suggestions for videos to check out that could guide me in the best direction....would be extremely EXTREMELY GRATEFUL!!!!
oh my what a great subject in Hannah and the Kandee Girl is the best of the best at transforming and second to none at make up! great both of you
GENDER APPROPRIATION!!!!!!! Hannah HATES appropriation so she goes with it! UNACCEPTABLE!!!!
