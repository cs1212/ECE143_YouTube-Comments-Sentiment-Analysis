I agree with the memes idea. Within the realm of trending topics for a given week, I think memes would be a solid addition. And maybe the top news story? Like if something has shown up in at least 5 different news agencies, ask the reactors about it. Also, just for kicks, can you pick like one obscure topic for them to react to? Like here's all this stuff trending rn, but did you know that some guy recently finished a 3 year journey to visit every national park in the USA? That was a quirky story I heard about recently.

You should react to a chinese show called "The sound of my dream" ! It's a really popular show in china and in chinese speaking countries, where there is a panel of establish singers in the show, and ordinary people would come in to challenge the singers in a sing off with the singer's song but with a twist. The show went viral immediately because of the amazing live performances of top mandarin singer JJ Lin. The show encapsulates the essence of creativity and dream chasing, being a show that greatly emphasises on composing and arranging songs. It will definitely be worth it to check it out!

Do a reaction to thoughts on the way Game of Thrones ended and how you would have changed it.
It'd be interesting to see them trying to guess/reacting to 10 countries that are #1 for different things, then you could pick so many different topics and hopefully teach people interesting facts about other countries. Or records held by different animals - fastest land animal is easy, but loudest sound made by an animal, or deepest diving animal are really interesting too! Or top news stories around the world... I like topics where the cast and the viewers will learn new facts and become interested in new areas...

2 Ideas for an episode:

1. Generations react to climate change. This discussion is far too important, and it would be great to use this platform to illustrate the dire nature of this situation.
2. Generations react to the happy newspaper. There is a woman who has come up with a newspaper of only happy news that’s released quarterly. It’s very important to talk about the bad, but having an episode that focuses on the good can help your audience remember the bright spots in our world.

1:20 when you create a meme
Like, who watched 5-minute crafts but doesn’t do anything
Dude 5 minute crafts is like one of the most trash chanels ever
I still pass notes we be throwing books across the classroom and my teacher never sees
I think Malcolm was high as hell in this one 😂😂
The guy : stir it up , then feed it to your enemies .. 
Me : I'm dead
Wait so they didn't know Permanent Marker can be erased with a white board marker?!?!?! Did they go to Elementary
We did the straw flower thing in school and it was kinda hard
just me or is this girl like super gorgeous 2:01 !?
do you know that 5 minuets crafts are the troom troom people
“stip it up, and uh feed it to your enim- oh iTs BubbLes!!
Seeing all those straws make me think of all the turtles that could of died 😭🐢
You can trace the permanent marker instead of wasting ur dry erasers.
1:35 not gonna lie, she described it perfectly...
Im glad malcolm and ted (and anyone else) are staying positive during the life hacks with no use also no offense to people who who think im wrong just dont hate please
I used that erasable permanent marker trick before it was cool
Crying at the amount of straws used
Geneva was deadass not there for the the whole ass video then they put her at the end 😂
5 minute craft
Have joined the server*
I thought everyone knew to put whiteboard marker over vivi-........
Next up...







TROOM TROOM
I like how everyone says "This is taking longer that 5 minutes" they did mean it literally!
THE GIRL WEARING THE RAINBOW SHIRT IS HORRIBLE!!!! I HATE HER!!!!!
Can someone tell me what does shit mean
I'm 5 years old
Just cut the upper part of the chipbag and it would be easier and wont make anynoise
I mean I would try one but .......... they don’t mention what they need and what type so ya
0:12 me as a kid im not suprised that the permanent marker would erase with a dry marker because we do it at school if someone writes a permanent marker on the board..,we even sometimes use Pilot marker (not permanent) to erase it😂
i thought the marker one is universally known?? ive known that one since i was a kid???
5-Mins craft Are trash wanna know why? Its because |THERE HACKS*sucks*|
I mean can't they see they could be using the wrong kind of straws or the wrong pack of baby wipes or something😕😕😕
For chips at school just bring a ziplock bag, woah innovative
5-minute crafts is just going to listen to when I want to go to sleep like when I'm in bed and I'm sleepy but I don't want to go to sleep yet I usually fall asleep watching it don't judge me lol
I still pass notes 🙋
4:23 it may be cool and all but SAVE THE TURTLESSSS
2:19 that hit hard😢
Imaoooooo
One of my favourite crafting and hacks and DIY channel
They were being "negative" because most of the crafts are useless lmao.
the one that cant erase my classmate just invented that we didnt know that its on a 5minutes craft
smh negativity
Love the positivity of the guy in the grey shirt
except malcolm, the rest of them are rude. they didn't even try hard but already comment on everything
Why tf are they so negative? The guy in grey shirt was wholesome and positive as hell
They need to stop being so negative like I like the guy in the grey shirt bro
This people pissed me of so much after watching this. They barely put any thought about what they’re doing or what they’re saying. If you are going to say something negative then keep it to yourself. Rather than being rude and disrepsectful, can’t you just actually just stay positive and try to make the best out of the situation because it lowers the confident of the person and it can really cause a big difference to them. Rather than talking shit about it, try to actually do it properly and reduce talking bad about it when you actually haven’t try it. Give it atleast a fucking chance
react to Eurovision!
So negative
Bro most of these guys pissed me off like no shit you can go buy it for 99 cent congrats but people wanna have fun and craft something that's why it's called 5 minute crafts. Like respect to Malcolm
Why is the guy in the grey shirt so wholesome and pure i cant even
these comments are so recent
They’re really being way too negative like damn it’s not a big deal
These edibles aren't shit:


10 mins laters: 4:31
Surprisingly toothpaste cleans things (including teeth😂) really wellSurprisingly toothpaste cleans things (including teeth😂) really well
What's with the negativity? A lot of this is just giving ideas on how to use basic materials lying around or how to deal with something when you're in a bind. The channel isn't forcing anyone to do anything °~°
The people in five min crafts used flimsy straws
The man that subscribed is so respectful,and nice c: aka malcolm
I did the first hack in 2nd grade so like-
4:30 such a sweet and wholesome reaction😊 I love Malcolm❤️
4:20 SaVe ThE tUrTleS 🐢
i strive to be as positive as the dude with the dreadlocks
So much attitude with these people (some of them). DIY are necessary, it helps some certain people thats probably not like them because they are "rich" that can buy anything. People love to explore, people cant buy the expensive/easy things -- thats why diy are made. Jeez! 👎🏻
So many turtles died to make this video 😢
This was a lot of negativity 😂 with a side of positivity!
Players gonna hate
4:43

Its me......I'm everyone. 😐😂
Adults just don't understand. Their hacks are really interesting, they don't need to be useful. That's just for some things that you can do. To give you some ideas for something. That's just for fun, and that life hacks can be useful sometimes.
React to troom troom 😂😂
I tried 4:17 everyday when I went to work because it was so hot

How are the 5-minute craft videos funny, Tori im so confused.
It's called good advertising=money+subs. That is why they have so much staff.
React new old town road music video
we learned the marker thing in  kindergarten
I remember the only video of theirs I watched, they did a starch test using iodine solution, to fool people that the resulting purple colour means that the food is bad. They also claimed honey had genetic memory. They do not deserve anyone's subscription or views.
“Stir it up and feed it to your enemies..” 
“OHHH BUBBLES THATS EVEN BETTER!!” 
I’m dead 😂😂
"Where the fuck do you buy a tiny cactus"
Why does the dude with the dreads remind me of bob ross
The straw one didn’t work because there was too many straws to begin with.
Girl: “Yo who pases notes this days”

worst thing about 5min crafts: they use a gluegun for so much.... BUT , hello, glueguns kinda suck XD it's okay, but never really holds + you burn yourself if you're not carefull
I can't even imagine how much waste 5 minute crafts produces. They use SO MUCH plastic.
5:00 that’s how I feel about FBE...
like, the towel with the spoons. I like the look of the towel... as decorative, for when you have guests, or just to have a pretty look in your bathroom... but putting your fork and stuff in it? Like, use a napkin? why use a whole towel?
Troom Troom will be next
Now it's time to react to "troom troom" lmao!
Was I the only one that felt bad for them using a lot of straws and then wasting wet wipes?
Yeah stir it up then feed your enimes. Then. BOOM! THEY DEAD REEEEEEE
4:45 "Then feed it to your enemies!" 😂😂
"herro"
This is a lot of work for a peanut butter sandwich😂😂
Malcolm needs to be president
I guess i am subscribed to it...

Love Malcolm and Dominic. Thanks for being so positive incomparison to Tori...
yikes, kinda disapointed that you done the straw craft. theres already too much plastic waste, please don't indirectly support these kinds of things :(
Malcom is so positive that’s how all of them should have been
I love watching 5 minute crafts!
They have very creative ideas
Yikes look at all of those plastic straws...
They reuse all of the crafts that's why they release so many videos they just rename it
They Need to Watch Troom Troom now. 😂😂😂
Love how positive Malcolm is!!
it should be called 5 minute crap not 5 minute crafts because they are trash wtf is the no noise chip bag that is so bad.
What is the point of the no noise chip bag bc after u are done eating u are going to throw the bag away boi 😂😐🙄

Wait they didn't know about the permanent marker and dry erase markers one? 🤦‍♂️
Who carries a blade or a white board eraser to class?
5 min crafts can be helpful. They just don’t know that till they are helpless and  need one of those ideas and looks up that hack that is by 5 MINUTE CRAFTS. (Also no hate on the guy with the dreads)
Let’s admit it. We just clicked on this just to know if they hate it.
I pass notes :( probably because im in grade 4

Ive known about the first one for my whole life lol
they are so bitter 😂🙅🏽‍♀️ (beside the guy with the dreads.)
The dry erase one not only did we learn in science class (learning about ethanol and similar chemicals, like the 2-butoxyethanol in these markers causing ink to become erasable), but if you've ever worked in a retail environment that always got stupid teens tagging evey available surface with permanent marker, you learn quick what's gonna take it off easier.
Straws+🐢=☠️
that?" I said that I learned it myself.. They never believe me no one does
The dry erase marker one... it's like the one who was surprised never tried writing on packing tape with marker, heh

Your killing the turtles
Ok I’m actually surprised that these worked
I usually watch FBE videos in a private window, but five minute crafts is a pure content farm.  Youtube said they were going to crack down on content farm videos and cut their revinue, but what they really meant was they really going to exempt five minute crafts and garbage like Bright Side. that generate them too much revenue to ignore.
Wait they actually reacted to something

Sure let’s waste a whole bunch of plastic straws doing a failed craft... not cool FBE
soooo don't take a straw with your drink (that's bad)......just waste 200 straws to replicate a stupid 'craft' for literally no purpose. There were 50 other crafts you could have chosen...
This is cheap garbage that people watch and think it works. When people try this in real life it does not work only some of these work and the reason why they even put it in is so they look all real but they really don’t work
I swear everyone knows the marker one though

What’s the point of the no noise chips and only your chips last for a day or something if you don’t eat them a lot it’s just kind of wasting wet wipes

Filipinos know that marker thingy. Children in second grade accidentally using permanent markers who don't wanna get in trouble would try anything.

Ndid
this is sooooo old at this point
Try not to— 5 minute crafts
The whole problem with the failed craft attempts in this video is that FBE purchased all brand name items for them to use. The key is to have cheap items that are poorly made so they can be manipulated and peeled and such.

Hear that FBE producer straight-up just bash 5-Minute crafts? 😂😂😂
No one brings those to school? I bring exacto knives to school all the time, and with extra blades. The college puts them in all the art student's class stuff you have to buy. Also in the Highschool art room and in the middle school tech ed room there were some too. Really nice for doing cut paper art.
5-minute crafts repeat their content. They will put like 3 new ones and finiah the video with repeat crafts.
Honestly, using those straws for that kind of decorating purpose is absolutely not sustainable and all of those plastic will end up in the trash bin after abt few days ?!! Stop wasting plastic in that way please, think about the environment man.
5:18 , save the straws , they said
I see alberto, I click ❤️

The guy with the salt and pepper dreadlocks was my favorite 😂 so positive

They probably threw the straws away and now the turtles are in danger
10:07 to 10:26 was my favorite part lol Disney but for crafts
The amount of plastic straws they used and probably throw away 🙃
I am so mad at tori
I discovered that marker one as a kid.

I sharpied my dad's office whiteboard, he walked by and was like "WHAT?! NO. ok whatever." And went away.

I got so scared that I grabbed one that I can erase and traced the exact thing again with it and just tried erasing it.

I was so relieved and happy, I waited for my dad to come back so I could show him that I fixed it.

 He was like "Wow. Great job!" Then he went away again, for cigarrettes, I have not seen him since, and also have not left the office. Help.
The answer is

NO
These girls are so negative like just enjoy!
React to troom troom pls

I mean was I the only one who used to do the dry erase over permanent marker when I was in school before i even saw it was a hack???
the marker one i accidentally found out on my own when i was like 9
viewwww alll my vids hurrryyy!! thanos!!!
When you watch these videos but never make any of the crafts😂😂😂
Love the fine cast but you used too many straws so they had no room to stretch and in the video their wipes pack was empty and they used brand new ones.  and this is ONLY MY OPINION
The channel should be a little more concious about the plastic they just wasted for some little content, we DONT need more plastic wandering around the planet and seas, be careful with your choices everyone!!!
that’s a lot of plastic straws wasted :(
i'm surprised no one knew the whiteboard permanent marker trick. my primary school teachers use it all the time lol
The thing is, they use the cheapest straws so that,
1. They’re easy to bend
2. More net profit
I bet you $83917263638 that you didn't actually read that whole number, so im guessing you didn't see the letter in it... You just sent back and checked and saw that I lied... muahahahaha

That toothpaste pump would work one or two times but once you got below the height of the straw you'd either have to cut it down or squish the toothpaste down in a way that it doesn't come out the top.

The first hack ive known since I was 5, the first time I found a dry erase board. In second grade some teacher said how to erase it because she used the wrong marker. i knew how but was to shy then another kid found out and got the money currency for the school. they thought he was so smart and was so proud. I am still mad about that to this day.

Again, they chose the wet wipes with lid that's not as easy to tear off just like in the video. Yes, an empty wet wipes case is preferable.


Look, I understand the skepticism of more than most of the people on this video and they can be critical of these crafts that appear to be much more bothersome to make on your own but yes, there are viewers on this massive platform that have the affinity to be crafty and try these things themselves. While the end product might not live up to the one advertised, it is the out-of-the-box thinking and process that people enjoy.


Give it a go yourself and how you feel at the end of it should let you know if this kind of videos are for you. If not, that's fine! If it is, well there's one specific channel cater to that just for you. In the end, that's the point of this video, right?

Save the turtles!
I'm surprised that some of them didn't know the marker one edit: most of them apparantly
I believe the straws in the original video are much more malleable than the ones they used trying to recreate it, hence the difficulty to achieve the intended result. It can be done, but I wish they pay more attention to the details.
My substitute teacher did the first one before
I'm disappointed for all the unnecessary waste of plastic in this video....
Our 9th grade science class was one of the first in our district to get dry erase boards. Not sure why they had a permanent marker anywhere near it, but a "jokester" decided to draw a rather graphic nudie picture, using the permanent marker. They got their laugh, then realized they couldn't wipe it away!!! 😲 The teacher ended up taping a rather large poster over that, inconveniently positioned part of the, very expensive board. 

Wish we knew that hack back then. 🤣🤣🤣

@Tori the 5 Minute Crafts videos are rarely sought after and they just appear for most people. It’s YouTube’s sucky algorithm. They are massive because they are actually a corporation and not real YouTubers. PewDiePie is the only real YouTuber at the top that actually thinks up his own content, creates his own content, and is responsible for the editing finalizing. YouTube only cares about money.

The sheer irritation of the Reactors is saddening. As an educator I look at this and see countless low budget possibilities to teach creativity, success, hand eye skills and recycling or simply entertainment.

 But noise about opening it? Use this thing called scissors or just eat chips in recess or lunch

You guys should have them do the DIY edible stuff on the Troom Troom channel. Now that would be hilarious.
4:30 this guys gotta be high, right? LOL
Just use a scissors to cut it?
Doesn’t that makes no sound as well?
Malcom is the definition of positive.

Tori is negative.
i think every person that uses board marker and permanent marker knows that?
I see a lot of people marveling at the idea of the dry erase board thing not being common knowledge, so maybe I can clear it up. Whiteboards have only been commonplace in schools for the last 10-15 years. No classroom in my 12 years of lower education had them. And, well, adults should know better than to write on them with permanent marker.
https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusMagnificentOstrichShadyLulu
That channel seems like the embodiment of everything that is wrong with YouTube. If you're just concerned about views then content doesn't really matter. And if they're putting out 1,500 videos a month, you know there has to be a lot of repetition, and crafts that are just plain unnecessary. You're just producing quantity over quality at that point. It's sort of like people who buy followers on social media. Sure, it looks nice that you have so many followers, but there's no actual engagement on what they're posting. It's just a shitty byproduct of the internet. People just want to be seen, and they don't really care about quality of content.
Malcolm is soooo sweet and adorable
Almost everyone who go to school and use marker know this...
5 minute crafts, bright side, actually happened; all these channels are under one company from Russia. And these guys are the scummiest, faceless, and soulless company on YouTube. They are literally abusing the algorithm with all these stupid videos while smaller creators have to deal with demonetization and slower growth. I seriously consider them 10x worse than how bad people think T-Series is
Oh look its bunch of people criticizing someone's work when they can't even do it even if they tried.
Officially hate Tori
Malcolm is always looking at the positive side of these unnecessary crafts. Everyone's criticizing them and hating, but Malcolm's just there loving it. It feels so heartwarming to see.
what happens if permanent maker is on your skin??? 2:55
Malcolm is amazing. We need more reacts with him in. He is so positive and we need more people like him in the world x

You can't even get your hand into the bag of chips! xD
Okay fun idea and all but you wasted a lot of plastic just for some views. We have a huge plastic problem going on and buying a lot of straws and later desposing of them (even if you use it once) is really not okay! You should revise your plastic policy and maybe try some more sustenabile video ideas. I'm sure a lot of your viewers will have fun watching them anyway :)
That whiteboard isn’t new I’m pretty sure a majority of people already know that such as me I knew that when I was in prep
We dont need turtles and beautiful aquatic life, as long as we have plastic staw table ornaments............ahhh climate change.🙃
Just like stan lee you should do one for jack kirby and Steve ditko the partners of stan lee

The negative reactions marks the end of "built it and do it yourself" generation. Everything accessible  in excess and everything disposable nothing is repurposed and the same people would complain about pollution *takes off tinfoil hat*
Stop wasting plastic, FBE! We are trying to get a way from using straws and you are just wasting 100s of straws for nothing...you know, climate change and stuff...you should have heard of it by now...

Malcolm is so positive, I love his vibes ✌💜
All of these “hacks” are so stupid like if you are going to eat a bag of chips do you really need to craft a fucking lid to it?
U need Longer straws
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN GONE!!!???

Malcolm was the only positive one for real!
Adults react to Dude Perfect plz
Tori is so against it🤣🤣
If you have cutting tools and you want to open a bag of chips, why the hell wouldn’t you just cut open the top like a normal person? Like yeah the most logical thing is to cut out the middle of the bag and stick part of a wet wipes package on top of it even though this doesn’t actually make it any easier to get chips or actually seal up the bag or anything like that. It’s completely pointless.
this is just realy wastefull, and i do  think this is a good topic to discuss but its not worth it in my opinion if means they just incurege waist like that, i like this channel and im not trrying to put them down i just hope they found a way to make this sastainable becuse thinking about the fact that they get mony and vies from making garbege takes away from the way i see the people working there
The only real reason I watch 5 Minute Crafts is to help me go to sleep
I cant believe some of them were just finding out that you could erase permanent marker by writing over it with a whiteboard marker. Like, seriously? Who DOESNT know that?
Everyone: This is so unnecessary.
Malcolm: This is so innovative.


I like how Malcolm is always so positive and has such great energy. He's my fav.

The fact that they didn't knoe about the permanent marker vs dry marker (white board pen) SHOOK me. We had to do this all the time in primary because my class kept switching the pens

5 minute crafts is stupid
The only one I think has any worth is the marker one. Which I thought most people already knew and frankly isn't a 5 minute craft anyway.
6:26 honestly, this guy always says what I’m thinking in my head 😂
I’ll be honest and say after showing them try the hacks I then gave up 2min into the closing speech.
I honestly like the guy with the bandanna he’s so chill 😂
5 minute craps, contributing to corporate profit mill take over YT.. making it impossible for the little guy/ individual to make it on the platform. 
One more thing to the list of things we can't have because people are too dense to know when they're being screwed over.
I’m actually surprised people didn’t know about the marker trick beforehand. I though it was common knowledge?!

I’m actually surprised people didn’t know about the marker trick beforehand. I though it was common knowledge?!
they seriously didn't know that you can erase permanent marker if you layer it with non-permanent marker? I've been knew it since I was like... five
“Are they only successful because they appear on everybody’s recommended feed?” Thats true but hypocritical at the same time
They must have used really cheap straws
I already knew the first one was real because I have seen teachers have to use that hack multiple times if you know what I mean
Some people just only like to watch their videos, without re-creating what they do 💁😂
5-minutes crafts is a click farm and most of their videos are recycled. It should be banned
Malcolm's hair is ah-may-zing.
literally Malcolm is the only one who says positive things about this channel.
And also for the straw one they did, it didn't work because they weren't using as much straws as the video, that's why it didn't work...
4:43 Stir it up then  feed it to your enemy's. OH! BUBBLES! EVEN BETTER!  😂

Most of 5 minute crafts are "life hacks " and there are some crafts that work there other things that are just crap like when they tell people to put toothpaste on burns which you dont do
literally nobody likes them, but still watch them.
Ya five minute craft is cinda Stupid what adout people who just watch videos
5:20 Plastic straws are made out of polypropylene. Although polypropylene can be recycled, most recycling facilities do not accept plastic straws. Straws are small and flexible, and can fall between the cracks of machinery, or get stuck. To make matters worse, plastic straws do not biodegrade. Instead, they continue to degrade into smaller and smaller pieces.Microplastics can be harmful to marine life, and they stay in our oceans and ecosystems forever. So please don't use them.

Incredible, absolutely none of these were useful and took more time to fix the "problem" to an "issue" that never needed fixing. These are like those infomercials that over exaggerate a situation to sell you a product and no one falls for this shit and clearly no one in this video is either.
Malcom seems very impressed
These channels are non-content farms, it's terrible.
How do people not know about the whiteboard marker one. Everyone does it tf
Not gonna lie, I already knew the dry erase thing bc as a kid I always used sharpie to draw on school whiteboards and I was scared of getting in trouble
God typical millennial, (yes I am too) complaining why not buy that, why not just not useful. PEOPLE ITS CALL USING YOUR CREATIVITY. if I see another video of them complaining. I’m out of this fbe channels

You should have YouTubers react to their first YouTube video
“I want my chips NOW...I don’t want it to be a craft project”

I feel like I need to mention that the trick for the diy silent chip bag is that the baby wipes is suppose to be empty not full and once it is empty you can take the lid off, but I can see that you guys have a full baby wipes bag so it is under standable that you would think this is dumb, really do pay attention to what the diy video is using okay
They used to much straw
How could they not know the marker hack? It's so old-school so many people should have already know it
Kinda unhappy they were so close minded :( like just think more i get some of them are actually useful
We need more Malcolm's
The one with the Notebook were actually cool I think
We do that permanent marker one all the time at school, we just put whiteboard marker on top and BAM the dirt is gone😂
Out of the 1500 videos a month from 5-minute-crafts, like 80-90% is repeated material. Out of 10 videos I’ve seen, like 9 of them have 50-75% repeated sections of the first video. They don’t even make new content, they just are lazy and literally take the section from one video and insert it into the next. They should be able to make more crafts with that amount of people they hired

None of the crafts are 5 minutes either

If you have a sharp blade.. why da fok don't you just cut the bag of chips straight up?

I don't make a lot of these crafts, but I have definitely been inspired by some of it.
Why make a no-noise chip bag when eating the chips makes so much noise?
I knew the dry erase board one works because my band director in 7th grade wrote with permanent marker by accident and someone told him to cover it with a dry erase marker

Please react to Tseries
When I first started watching YouTube videos, I watched some of those 5 Minute Craft videos. They were fun & interesting. But as I watched more of them I realized that most of their "crafts" were useless to me or where stupid or were impractical.
So I pretty much avoid those types of videos now.
Wow Tori looking like a rainbow swirl lollipop 😋

5 minutes crafts, the tips that take too frickin long to do, the useful stuff is already common knowledge, doesn't work nearly as well as the video say, not as easy to make as the video say, would actually be harder to do then just doing it regularly, and 99% of it is downright usrless

Afraid that opening a chips bag will get you caught so instead you take out a knife.

They are right, who in the living hell is going to bring a f***ing exacto knife to class unless it's an art class. Like come on get with the program, this isn't the 90s.

Why are they all negative? What is wrong with people wanting to have some fun and make stuff instead of buying it. Just fun stupid little things.

Is it me or is lowkey Malcolm high😂
Malcom is the purest guy ever, or he’s just super high
Tori was being soo rude
im not into diy stuff but i think i get it, the lesson there is that we're buying too much stuff, even if it doesnt cost much we'd rather buy than make it ourselves independently like they do it in farms.

First of all I was really hoping you would show the "hack" of putting on a mcdonalds bag on your head to not get make-up on  your shirt when you're getting dressed. A+ content there. Secondly, if you want "noise free chips"...you could just portion some into ziplock bags in the morning before you go to class or work or wherever. Not that opening a bag is a big deal...

3:30 "Almost impossible to draw a perfect circle free hand..." Ok, if theres anyone out there who are as clueless as she is. You're gonna want a pin, or thumbtac, some string, and a pencil. 
If you still need me to tell you how to use these to make a circle, that's terrible, but ok. 
Put the pin in whatever you're drawing a circle on. Tie the string around the pin. Tie the other end around a pencil. Pull the string taught, touch pencil to paper, draw the circle. 
 This basic version is faster, easier, cheaper, more accessible, more effective, less lilely to sling a pencil across the room, and put someones eye out.
I love Malcolm’s personality and attitude, he seems like a really nice guy to be around

I never try anything from their videos but IS just entertaining to watch 😅
I knew the marker hack when i was 5😂😂
So many of these are for RE-USE and to help lessen the need to keep buying and making trash. So many of these people are LAZY and want emediat satisfaction with no work or wait. Consumer mentality is problematic and a HUGE reason so much plastic and pollution grew out of hand in less then one hundred years.

The one where you put dry marker over the sharpie, I found that out like 3-4 years ago on accident when I accidentally used sharpie in my white board and then put dry marker over it and erased it, it worked! From that day on, I felt like a genius. Now everybody knows it so I don’t feel as smart anymore.

Some of these craft are pretty innovative. They weren't that difficult at all. Most of the reactors just complain the whole time, not willing to learn anything new. Good amount of em just gave up. It's very telling they don't know how to problem solve.  It's going to be a hard lesson once they have into go a job. This is really sad to see.

I see what you did there: Using up the last plastic drinking straws you had in stock before you get condemned for them!
The hundreds of straws they used for that one clip hurt the inner environmentalist in me very bad and I usually don't care about these things too much.
The chips one is actually smart tbh tho
7:14, Actually, everyone girl.
For the next craft you only need a pencil and a drill
5 minute craft is the worst channel and useless channel

Shitty cast for this episode. So close minded, always caring about details. Next time try and be like Malcom. The only one with an open minded and positive reaction. Like Malcom said, this are simple and accessible stuff to, almost, everyone
ngl i thought everyone knew this, and no one used this
This shit is useless
I like all the reactors and they’re fine having whatever opinions they want on videos(I actually like when they’re not always positive) but they seemed to not even want to try the 5min crafts in this one. They gave up too quickly and ended up with crap craft. Malcom’s usually came out decent like the vids and he was the only one enthusiastic enough to try them correctly.Did DIY hurt y’all or something? Lmfao
2:25 i’ve always known this trick as long as i can remember. for me im surprised people don’t already know this. i don’t/can’t  even remember where i learned it from

Why is everyone targeting Tori? She's literally just stating what she thinks. You all are getting upset at her just because she has different thoughts on it. I'm going to ask you something. What is FBE about? Reacting to stuff. That's exactly what Tori did. Do you want her to pretend and lie about her opinion, just so she can satisfy you guys? If so, then you disgust me.

5 minute crafts think out of the box to entertain an audience. Even if some crafts are silly or much more difficult then an novice crafter. They are still able be creative. They may not have a spokesman or on air talent as other youtube channels, but their creativity is the actual star. Please FBE be kind to other people in the youtube space your not the only shinning star out there.

I don’t get why 5 min crafts get so much hate. These aren’t supposed to be life hacks (though sometimes they are), they’re just CRAFTS. Yes some work and some don’t but so what, did you have fun doing it (well, if your doing for the actual purpose of usefulness then you probably didn’t and think it was a waste of time)
I like how the dead guy is so positive 😄
like everyone's like well why do that when I could just go to Amazon and buy it for 10 dollars or something but its like a cool way to do something like bubbles well i have an answer CUZ ITS FUN MAKING IT
Pro tip. Use nail polish remover for scuffs on shoes. IT FKIN WORKS
Anyone realized tom is missing??
They didn't know how to erase permanent marker with non-permanent marker? Whaaaaat?
How did they not know about the  permanent marker on the behind board? 😂😂
Tori so negative
The two people that are so pessimistic, I love them usually but it's draining listening to them complain so much. Like half of these things are people who actually want to put in the work for it, and it might take longer than 5 mins but that's the fun in making craft. 





Anyway that was my rant 2019 ✌🏾
I’m with Tori on this; I feel that at most, maybe 5-10% of these are going to be useful for someone somewhere. Most of these seem to be overcomplicating things that are not complicated in the first place. 

To each their own though
Not subscribed to 5 minute crafts because I rather look it up myself
Malcolm is high. You can’t convince me otherwise, because it makes this episode so much better.

Why is nobody talking about that 5min crafts (besides having hacks that just don't work) shows actually dangerous hacks (brushing your teeth with hot glue for example). Also, they're accused of being a content farm (re-using old footage multiple times in several videos to gain more watch time).

My favorite part was 7:44
the Dry Erase sharpie trick, I did that in school all the time (up to 20 years ago lol) I was a sharpie fanatic, I always had like 12+ different color ones on me. and I would draw these large elaborate drawings on the white board before class started, and people were always looking at me like I was crazy because they thought I was going to get in trouble. then Id just erase it after my teacher was about to send me to the office for vandalism. Other times I would draw really small things or replace something they wrote before with sharpie and watch them panic as they try and fail to erase it. It was my favorite prank back in the day because it was one of the most easy to do and not really punishable since I could easily fix it.
React to troom troom
That channel is one of the ugliest abominations Youtube ever brought to life
are tori and Alberto related?
The entire channel of 5 minute crafts is just further proof that creativity for it's own sake has no intrinsic value. Most of the "hacks" on that channel are not actually worth the time they take to create. The creative result must be either useful or in some way pleasing to have any value at all. Unfortunately it's also proof that people flock to useless things.
4:45 nothing is better than that except food 😂
This channel was founded by two Russian guys, so you can only assume that they're exploiting the Youtube algorithm to its fullest.
I always see this channel on new Youtube accounts, its actually insane how much they're recommended on Youtube when no one is actually seeking them out.
Yes!! I made it I love your channel!!
I think one reason people watch 5 mins craft is not because the people want to do it but instead they want to watch someone do it for them.... I also watch them just because I can be like "wow" and not because I want to do it myself too
The marker thingy? Yeah, many people knew about that like years ago. And cable ties aren't easy. Those are hard to pull.
NO!! JUST NOOO!! STOP MAKING THIS CHANNEL FAMOUS!! THE HACKS ARE STUPID AND DANGEROUS!!!
The mess quotient with cutting open a tube of toothpaste and just shoving a pump top onto it is unacceptable.  Stop using straws.  They ended up murdering sea mammals.  Baby seasl and dolphins everybody.  Just drink normally, and don't be creating trash that'll attract dust and have to be thrown away in a week.  No eating in class.  That's just obviously wrong and against the rules anyway.  
Surplus to requirements.
I watch these in school lol I almost died
7:18 cracked me so hard lol🤣🤣
They want to complain about 5 minute crafts viewer count to subscribers why not look at t series at 98million with views at like 600k and likes on that video of 14k lol.
The first one with the sharpie I already knew. I figured it out myself when I was in school once, it also works with dry erase markers that are dried and won’t come off
I feel like a lot of people watch these, think they are cool crafts, and never does them.
Sometimes 🤦🏻‍♀️, but on a side note Tori speaking truths here !!!
they pass just because they’re just jealous of five minute craft due to the fact that the creator got more subs
I'm sure the turtles love those straw decorations
Stop giving 5 minute crafts attention, they are dangerous. Literally have confirmed near deaths from these in the past.

Remember when they were teens aw memories
Wait what
I found out about the first one with the markers when I was a kid on accident because I wrote on the white board with the wrong marker and was scared that I was going to get in trouble so I grabbed the right one real fast and hid the other one and wrote over it with the right one. Then when the teacher came back into the room I continued to write on the board and made sure she saw so that when I would erase it all I could pretend that I had no idea how that happened. Lol but the whole thing erased! So I wrote on the board again with the wrong one with the teacher there and tried to whipe it off again thinking it would work but it didnt. And i started freaking out again and my teacher wasnt happy at all but i scribbled the right one over it and tried to wipe it off again and it came off. I was so proud of myself for finding this out and would trick everyone all the time and show everyone what I discovered! Lol
It was my teachers fualt for putting that marker there in the first place!
I love dead meat(youtube channel).and also this channnel

Shaggy!! Mr luba-luba is here😂😂😂
Lol I so definitely love FBE now
Wait a wah gwan here?!!! SHAAAGGGYYY!!! ❤❤🇯🇲
Never been in Jamaica but really want to =)
It's a good point that you don't really want an authentic jamaican accent unless it's a small gag character that you're not supposed to understand/ it's for jamaican audiences only.... It's like a different language altogether...
That's what's up FBE. Glad you did this..... Love my Jamaica
<3
This was great!
I liked this, it was interesting
I think -Mon came from Nintendo
Mr. Boom-BAH-stic
Not gonna lie, came here hoping to see Bushmaster.
What about from the Pirates of the Caribbean
Should have reacted to Joey Tribbiani´s try on a Jamaican accent hahah!
Shaggy is so serious.
I missed Kendra the Vampire Slayer in this video. Poor Bianca Lawson had her origins changed last minute and the accent was very strange
Not the shaggy I was expecting
Overall, it is very difficult to find a non-Jamaican actor who can do a proper Jamaican accent (whether pas tois or normal English with a Jamaican accent). I look forward to that day when that person does an interview and real Jamaicans get shook when they discover that person isn't even Jamaican at all 😂 Indian comedian Russell Peters might be the closest as a non-Jamaican/Caribbean person who can do a few Caribbean accents pretty decently.
I think y'all should have differentiated between accent and actually speaking patois. There's a difference between having an accent when you speak English and actually speaking a different language. So I wish he would have rated them purely on the accent and not on whether they were speaking patois or not.
pls make a reaction to boy pablo
what about shark tale? Ernie and Bernie ?
I’m proud of this🇯🇲
Next react to soca from Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹 🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹

Hey maybe the Yardie film directed by Edris Elba would have been a good shout for a well done Jamaican accent?
No Rastamouse, disappointed
Do bon Jovi reacting to flash mob playing it's my life!!!
Wait, no Calypso from Pirates? Was that not a Jamaican dialect depiction?
React to Eurovision 2019!!! Specially Portugal!!!
I can appreciate that he acknowledges that a proper, heavy patois would pretty much be impossible for most to understand and how it would overcomplicate a scene.
What about grim from grim adventures of Billy and Mandy?
Id of loved to see him react to Tia Dalma
That lil trini reference had me in awww
Goddamn it FBE Sebastian was Trini not Jamaican! Don't you see the pan?
Cool runnings is not an authentic Jamaican accent?! Still a great movie though
Drake's accent?
Should've had Little Jacob from GTA IV in there just for fun.
If shaggy sang under the sea, I’d buy that!
Shhhhhaggy!! The coolest dude
I'm Jamaican
🇯🇲🇯🇲 Yes! Shaggy! He’s the best! Always repping my (our) Jamaica 🇯🇲.
Every single video was ATROCIOUS!! lol Shaggy was being VERY kind and diplomatic, but trust if the gloves were off, he'd say worse lol
Shaggy!!!!!
Thank you for putting in that Cool Running scene !!
Butt talks..🤣🤣🤣😝😝😝😝😆😅😂 I lost it there. 



Buttocks
What about Grim from The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy? Probably not accurate either, but is closer than that futurama guy.
i can just hear SHAGGY while look at his picture
They put in Ms Cleo, pretty sure she died? Either that or it's a mandela effect. 😂
Shaggy you did not listen to Bush Master you were talking while he was. You listened to the other character
i like and sub and click the bell
It wasn’t me
Mr Boombastic !!!!!! SHAGGY !!!
Shaggy and Mike Epps look like cousins, for real.
Why the editor talking back, you can’t talk back to Shaggy
How could iii forget that i had given her an extra key
im only watching this for the office part
Yess, love Shaggy
SO, SHAGGY AND ALL THE REST OF YOU- DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT SPEAK LIKE US IN ANY FORM OR SHAPE. HOLLYWEIRD HAS ALWAYS TRIED TO IMITATE US IN MANY WAYS. NOT EVEN SHAGGY CAN TELL THEM CERTAIN TRUTHS. SPEAK TO  HOW THE BRITS AND OTHER FOLKS THINK THAT THEIR WAY OF SPEAKING AND GRAMMAR IS THE RIGHT WAY. THEY WOULD NEED TO BE INTRODUCED TO RASTAFARI WAYS OF SPEAKING. RAS CARDO HAS THE ICABULARY.
should've put bushmaster from luke cage...
This would have been better as a scale, rather than a accurate VS not accurate
Finally a jamaican to tell them how awful they sound
Ayyyee🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Ms. Cleo
Never seen Shaggy get pissed... Oh, mon!
Hopefully Hollywood will know their depiction of Jamaican Patois is garbage after this....
Wait isn't Sebastián from the little mermaid trying to make a Caribbean accent, especially Cuban accent. It isn't supposed to be Jamaican. Am I wrong?
Where was the Shark tale scene? 😂 

I love shaggy! His music is amazing.
Lil Jacob from GTA VI should have been there my breda 😋
Sanka ya dead?? Ya mon 😂😂
Should have included Kendra from Buffy the Vampire Slayer!
It wasn’t me
Ohhh that’s boombastic
Shaggy was dead on! As a fellow born and raised Jamaican, my advice is to hire a Jamaican actress.
Great work ..

Now waiting for John Oliver to react to British Accents..
How did you not include the 30 rock jamaican accents? There was just so many of them in a brief time!
He needs to be sebastian for the live action movie
Kevin from the office that's why i cilked and shaggy
The “mon” instead of “man” came from the Apple Jacks commercials , “cinna mon”
It’s sad to see people don’t know who Shaggy is 😭😂
WE ARE THE JAMAICAN BOB SLED TEAM🎼
Who dis dude
I'm pretty sure he's is not Jamaican
Shaggy, today we are judging Jamaican accents...NOT people strictly speaking Jamaican, do you understand?
Shaggy: Yes
Shaggy during the video: Nobody was speaking Jamaican
rut ro raggy
Next should be bad Boston accents
No little Jacob from GTA?
Do British accents next
I've never wanted to be a beard as much as I do now
Shaggy: *feels his beard.*
Me: Can I pet it too?
Some of those were examples of Jamaicans speaking to non-Jamaicans so it makes sense that they wont speak with the slang and words that Jamaicans use when speaking to other Jamaicans
Wasn’t me
im qauter jamaican <3
You should put the one who sung this song
 "informer dgdhdhdhhdshhdhdhhdjfjdhlame a licky boom boom down, i forgot the artist lol
Shaggy would be awesome to voice Sebastian in a live action Disney the little mermaid film, cmon Disney let’s make it happen!!!
Seriously? Futurama? A silly cartoon about a silly 1000 years + future... LET'S TEST THE ACCURACY OF ACCENTS!
Shaggy seems like he would be a cool guy to hang out with
They could’ve tried the Jamaican girl from apex lol
Bruh, They Should have done Lil Jacob From GTA4. I didn't understand half the shit he would tell me 😂
"I'd take your pole."


Shaggy: "Ha!"


Me: I'd take his pole and suck it while he sings It Wasn't Me.
Maybe this is just me but even as a kid hearing steel pan playing in anything that's not explicitly Trini made me really happy
It's a cartoon no ones going to do a Oscar nomination performance 
[shows Disney film]
They should have shown him Little Jacob and Badman from GTA 4. They're true jamaican accents, especially Badman.
MISS CLEO!!!! XD
Raaaaaaaay! Shaggy deh pon FBE to neckback. Big up yuhself 🗣🇯🇲
Did Shaggy just say 4 Mil? loool. bruh, you been gone too long..

You should have put Snow in his song «informer » where he speaks with Jamaican accent
i seen him in concert way back when he opened up for bsb in 2000 back then everyone was buppin wasn't me XD
I think shaggy missed the whole point of the question and focus on dialect rather than actual jamaïcain accent of people talking in English
PLEASE Elders or generations react to old town road
My mom and dad are Jamaica so I could understand everything
Anyone think for a second this was a different more powerful shaggy
Personally I think he misunderstood "accent". Like I have German accent when speaking English, when speaking German I have a dialect...

I hadn't noticed before but most people seem to think that Jamaicans change the A in Jamaica and man to O's. From what I hear, it's more of a double A sound. Other people would say Ja-mai-ca, while Jamaicans say Ja~mai-ca.
Is this accurate to real world Jamaicans?
Should showed him that clip of Badman from GTA IV
Somebody said he's overrated...i can't tell you who said it but I'll give you a hint.

No Rastamouse?!?! Get his reaction to it!
I am from Guyana and I never saw a video with shaggy talking......Shaggy speaking standard English is interesting but also shows how Caribbean nationals are good code switchers
He's right about TRUE Jamaican accents.  I've travelled there a few times and the native people are almost impossible to understand.
Little Jacob & Badman  from Grand theft Auto 4 - Now that's authentic
Should have showed him the jellyfish brothers from shark tales
“Who’s calling?”
“You should know you’re the psychic” 
😂😂
Who knew Shaggy is such a respectable and eloquent man. Really cool
It wasn't me
“It made me feel tropical” 😂😂😂😂
Actually Sebastian is a Trinidadian Crab!!!
It wasn't him
Hearing Shaggy sing Under the Sea is something I didn't know I would hear during my life. But I'm cool with it.
Damn he can lose his accent like crazy!
I have a suggestion. How bout you guys do a vid of people reacting to Caribbean music?

Please bring shaggy back
I'm Jamaican but I everytime I tell anybody where I'm from people always "yeah man" it's always at work and I can't be offended by it because it's a customer who always says. Honestly I have heard it so much that I start to mess with them a little bit by speaking full on patwa.
Trini here 🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹, love seeing the similarities between Caribbean accents

When Jamaicans Talk, I Feel Like They Are Going To Hurt Me
The thing is, the joke in the dialogue with Brad Pitt was golden.  If his accent had been better, it would have been greater.  Only critique in the writing would have been to use vacation instead of holiday.  But I’m Trini, so maybe that’s why.
Who is he?
Honestly I just came to see Sabastian
I commented before I watched. Well done Shaggy you explained everything so well.

Elders react to The Who?
Love his outfit. Hi
Please react to Twice
Should've included GTA 4.
Please react to TWICE
This was interesting, but I feel like the way he was evaluating them was kind of off. He was saying that if they were speaking an authentic patois then people wouldn't understand them so they were throwing lots of English in there. But patois is not English, it's basically another language. So they shouldn't be evaluated on how they speak patois but on how close their accent is to Jamaicans who speak patois-accented English.
React to twice fancy
Any one else think they meant scooby doo.
Please react to eurovision 2019!!
he keeps sayin as close to while speaking eng     well its ment to be Jamaican accents not the Jamaican lang

 Growing up in a Jamaican household its easy to catch who's authentic or not.

You should have tried Little Jacob from GTA 4.
You should have snuck in a real Jamaican talking. He’d probably say it wasn’t accurate either lol
Who is this guy?
Now I want Shaggy to voice Sebastian in the eventual live-action Little Mermaid remake hopefully starring Francesca Capaldi if they get it going within the next year.
He’s using 1% of his power to judge these Jamaican accents
Where I used to work at, we have a Jamaican born working there and his accent is amazing! Sometimes I can't understand what he is saying but he's cool.
Sweet gorilla of manilla

using hollywood accents is not fair. You gotta hear the real thing.
You guys should get the guys who did the echo arena video and go do the echo combat game mode if you need players to teach them me and many players of the community would love to teach them but you should message the discord in general to let us know
PLEASE DO A REACT TO FANCY BY TWICE
All I could think throughout this video is how awesome it would be if @IISuperwomanII and @Humblethepoet were in it as well because they SPEAK JAMAICAN PATIOS.
Whatever happened to Shaba Ranks or Beanie Man? Shaggy outlasted all of 'em, as far as longevity is concerned.
I hope someday for a react to World Order music videos, specially Have a Nice Day, Permanent Revolution, Singularity, In New York, and Let's Start WW3.
should have had the jellyfish from shark tale
I like his laugh 😂
Should have shown Kendra the vampire slayer lol Defo want to see more of these 'how bad are hollywood accents' , do Irish accents next :p
Shaggy is mixing up Jamaican Accent with Dialect (patois). Whilst most of them are not accurate, Jamaican Accent is speaking English with an accent. And that is what Hollywood always messes up.
Shaggy like, “Well it wasn’t me, so it’s not authentic”
my fellow Jamaicans where you at
PLEASE DO A REACT TO BITLIFE VIDEO!!!!!!

Hey its shaggy,he made song for 2007 cricket worldcup and its awsome❤
JAMEHKAAN AHKSENT
Pretty cool he came along but I think he got confused between language and accent. Obviously the language will be wrong in all but the most authentic Jamaican portrayal because, like he said, mainstream audiences will struggle to follow what’s being said. I want to know if the accent is accurate, not the language
Tall missed shark tail
They should have showed him Predator 2.
Fancy Twice

The little mermaid clip should have been a dialogue instead of a song.

U know it would be awesome if Arnold Schwarzenegger reacts to every arnold voice Impressions to wether or not are accurate

Lol I loved shaggy. So glad he still singing
Okay I'm only here for Sebastians and Tuff for him but still he has a great voice
To be fair to the Luke Cage clip they didn't use anywhere near the best Jamaican Accent in that show.
Pat what!?
My pops is from trini and my mom is from Puerto Rico and here I am a kid from Houston who can’t understand his parents bc they have such strong accents 😂
Why was shaggy so stubborn with how accurate the accents were? Their not going to be perfect!
I like that he critics with the reasonable thoughts of various accent which give a lesson to us NOT TO BELIEVE IN STEREOTYPE!!
I am a simple bread. I see Aston Kutcher and I click.
No love for "butt talks"??
Jamaican creole isn't that hard to understand but then again I'm St.Lucian so i have an advantage  :3 Big up mi islanders
they should have had him react to the jelly first from shark tale
He so stubborn 😂
Y'all disrespecting my QUEEN SEBASTIAN






No hate tho just ❤ the movie
I thought the little mermaid and the Luke cage one wasn’t that bad
You should’ve made him react to the Jamaican gangs from GTA IV
DISNEY IF YOUR READING THIS
IF YOU MAKE A LIVE ACTION LITTLE MERMAID 
CAST SHAGGY AS SEBASTIAN
Oh SHIT it’s fkin SHAGGY!!!!!!! Wow!
They forgot shottas
the man from the little mermaid was Trinidadian tho
As a Jamaican this video hurt me
When you can watch a video about your culture and you can understand no matter how raw the accent gets
Funny thing is, the Sabastian actor said a Trini accent was his inspiration.
Shaggy: Who was making this bad Jamaican accent?

Me: It wasn't me
I feel like you guys forgot the introduction to the show? Celebrities React?
College kids and adults react to Tame Impala and Mac Demarco. PLEASE!!!!

They should've shown Grim from Billy And Mandy
He doh sound much Jamaican at all tho
should have shown shottas
When shaggy exaggerates his accent in his music but then is the aficionado on authentic Jamaican accents.
As a joke they should have thrown in Jessie's impression from Little Mix 😂😂😂
BALIEGDA😂😂😂😂
Yay nice to see a Jamaican on screen ya kno.
Shaggy is one of the artists i listen too growing up!!! it wasn't me, angel, bombastic, so nostalgic! <3
Loved this
HELL YEAH SHAGGY
Should have added Jacob from GTA IV and have Shaggy react to him.
To save you some time...

No accent was accurate... 😑
FBE should have probably have shaggy rate them on a scale of like between 1-5  instead of yes or no.
React to lil peep
lol is it weird to say that even his laugh sounds Jamaican?!
I see Kevin Malone I click 🤷🏽‍♂️
I want to see the same type of episode but using an Irish person and the attempts at an Irish accent in tv shows and films
Oh wow I like Shaggys personality lol his voice and speaking is nice.
I came for Kevin
Wrong shaggy
Not many people know that the person who voiced Sebastian the crab is originally Trinidadian.🇹🇹 So the accent that everyone is listening to is actually Trinidadian not Jamaican.
Love this 👏👏👏
I'm surprised he didn't recognize Cool Runnins. I thought everyone in Jamaica had seen that movie 😆
Miss Cleo was famous when I was growing up for her ridiculous accent.
The most authentic Jamaican accent I've heard on screen is probably a new-ish tv show, "Manifest".
Hahahah you can kinda hear them laughing a lot
U should've put in clips from lil Jacob in gta4 or Badman from gta4 😁

1. Is it true when foreigners hear any Caribbean accent they say it's Jamaican?
I ask because Sebastian The Crab is/was Trinidadian (like Shaggy noticed). 
2  Do you really think we talk too fast? I think we speak normally and you guy talk slow.

Maybe Hollywood should try casting more Jamaican actors, who are able to do an authentic Jamaican accent by mixing the dialect, the unique cadence of how Jamaicans speak with the Queens English so that people can understand. Just a suggestion

You didn’t play him the worst Jamaican accent of all time though! That would be Bianca Lawson’s in Buffy, where she plays a “Jamaican” slayer. It’s hilarious!
I thought it was the voice of shaggy... :(
Should of done That’s So Raven, when she does the accent for that one episode of being a hotline Psychic.
Wait Jamaicans don't say 'Mon'? My life is a lie.
biggie cheese?
I always say that no Jamaican ever says “yea mon”! Not one of us in the 3.5 million on this Jamaica land we live says “yea mon”.

This is pretty interesting. So some of the accents might actually be bad because an authentic one would make it hard to understand. There’s a balance.

Not only Jamaican but the entire English Caribbean accents sounds similar
I'm shooked to him here. Jamaican representin. Wi deh yah man
So shaggy's accent isn't real? My entire childhood was a lie!
Being from the Caribbean I can understand probably everything they say
Why I thought they meant the actor of Shaggy from the live Scooby Doo movies? I'm so stupid, especially since I heard of Shaggy before
Jamaicans have the hardest accent to understand and I’m from uk we got a lot of Jamaican people here
I call for a re-shoot there was no bombastic rat from Back in the Barnyard

Very cool FBE.

As a half-Jamaican myself, hearing those accents are so horrible that it’s funny 😂
I think he's rating dialects instead of accents. Big difference
I truly love the fact that he voted NO on everything. As a Caribbean person myself that checks out. We are generally unimpressed with people's attempts to mimic our accents
What's the deal, FBE? I was looking at Jamaican slang, and listening to Spice just a little while ago. And now this?
Ya mon!
Idk what you are talking about. Kevin’s Jamaican accent is spot on

Interesting that any Jamaican portrayed wasn’t accurate this makes me want to go visit the country now

Shaggy has got to remake Under the Sea!
Lol, I used to love Miss Cleo commercials. She was entertaining even if she was an all-around fraud.

I am in the same boat when I hear people trying to do a Texan accent.  Interesting thing is, even in Texas, the accent differs.  The more famous one is heard in the Dallas area in north Texas.  Here in the south it's less prominent but at times you can still hear it.
Who else thought they meant shaggy from Scooby Doo? 😂

Been to Bahamas and tour guides will speak the Queen’s English to the tourists but will switch around and talk in what sounds like a completely different language with their coworkers. Most likely the same in Jamaica
The Luke cage one still hurts me to this day 😭😭 😂
I like how he was saying no Jamaican says mon but when he said man without emphasizeing the word, it sounds like he said mon.
Kinda hoped we would see his reaction for the cutscene from gta4.

I get what he means, any time someone portrays a character that has to put an accent on they always go over the top.
For instance when someone dose an Irish accent they always make it sound like they are either drunk or just make them speak fast.
The same goes for the English accent it's either posh or cockney.
There is no middle ground and i just think that's stupid.

Godzilla king of the monstet reaction?
I was 11 when I watched it. I wasn't scared at all tbh. It's good tho
I liked the “hello@
I watched the first film without reading the book and I’m aiming to read the book before this one comes out coz I’m so hyped to watch ittttt
Tbh the first one was more suspense than scary...the only jump-scare scene that was really good was the one when they were all in the garage watching images on the projector. Not to mention for all the people that have read the book like me....we were probably more interested in seeing how well they incorporated the book into the film. Still I do believe that the original 1990s adaption of the book is the best! You can't beat classics. Tim Curry will forever be IT for me!
They can bring the x men team
The fact that Steven King the master of Horror himself has said that this was a great movie makes me that much more excited to see it!  King usually hates movies based on his books but he particularly liked this one!
7:41 I knew it right when I watched the trailer the 2nd time I actually paid attention to that mark and remembered the stabbing scene at the ending of part 1 and I was like SISTER SHOOK!!
I have never read the book so you can shoot me for that but I really looked into everything. The first adaptation I love it and it is done so well and so was part 1, but dang these kids seem like they never looked anything into Pennywise in general, like some of the stuff isn’t spoilers or whatever they are actually what it is in the first adaptation.
I WANT THE ADULTS REACTING TO THIS PLEEEEEASSSEEE!
Is nobody going to talk about the fact that they are all excited to seem them as adults when clearly, the original one had already done it.
I was 13 when I watched IT and I wasn't scared at all, I was just so captivated and excited😕
“ that’s like a pennywise move “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂

No.
11:10 - 21 seconds later 😑 first thought was: If u already haven't had a child yet, like 2 years ago, please continue to refrain from reproduction.
Kids: never read the book. 




Also kids: "I like how they're including more details from the book".
Teens react to Zac Efron as Ted Bundy.

6:55 😂 das sum good stuff right there lmao
Read the dang book
3:38 that hello tho.
I believe, if I read was correct, that ain't tea in that cup and it's not blood either
Book first.  Great book.  Stephen King.
Movie.  Mini series. Remake.  Remake sequel.
So nobody read the book. Half didn’t even see the first movie. Who cares about their reactions
OMG Jaxon is sooooooo cure.
9:28 Yeah and he's Charles Xavier in X-Men.
Jordan is just too cute. Loves her
At the starat the woman’s voice is actually pennywises voice
Everybody should read IT. The book is so great that they could never film it the same way and so much more happens. Also you find out more about Pennywise and where is coming from. I am not even that much of a reader but IT i read 2 times and i am sure that some day i will read it again.
I don't go on my friends or critics opinions. I go on my own opinions. But I will float to the theaters.
Omg this is cheese to watch
7:35, um... just a fact
Penny wise is only one of their forms.
Their “true form” is female
Their actual form is impossible for humans to see
watching trailer

everyone is scared



jaxon and pennywise: “helloo” 😂 

that got me dead
I’m sorry. But you really need to get some proper south east London British people reacting to this shit. Their reactions would be 10x funnier wtf😂

React to IV Of Spades
Has nobody seen the first movie? The original IT shows that Beverly  is going through domestic violence issues. Not shackles like in this one but was hit by her "lover".
Then the tea part Is in the OG as well. The tea is full of blood.
The trailer looks promising, but I'll stay cautiously optimistic until I see the film for myself. 
FYI: this is the first time in a while that I've seen Reina in a new vid, so it's good to see her back again.
"That's the guy from Split." Uh, he was also in X-Men
At the end of the it chapter 2 it's the girl from part 1 1990 version
3:38 helluu
The previous IT movie wasn't even scary. It's fun to watch tho
If you truly what to see something that is so scary I dare you to whaich this youtube video '' Top 10 Creepyest/Weirdest YouTube Videos''      Remember to put on your headphones when you are whaich it..😈
Almost none of these teens know anything about Pennywise like at 7:44 "Maybe being Pennywise passes down through the family"
I enjoyed the first one but it was more creepy than actually scary and I hope that this movie is different
IT II comes out on my birthday :)
Has none of them seen the 1990 mini-series?
Looks really bad
its crazy how so many kids and teens went to see it
Have teens react to Hobbs and Shaw official trailer
Fbe ugh
Ohh hell nawwwwww
I don't know why but Jaxon remind me of Jaeden Lieberher (billy)
Hello
I needed this.
Reina "The first one was very scary" Are you kidding me? That was the problem! "It" is a movie about fear but it's not even scary.
these kids are stupid AF. They obv never watched the original mini serious because it was too long and beyond their infantile attention spans.
grandma got some scary moves😵
6:52 Omg his laugh sounds just like Chenle's from NCT Dream. Who else agrees? He's really cute too. Idk. My new favorite reactor I guess.
First one wasn’t scary but this one looks like it has a creepy af vibe
9:47 HEEYYY 🙄
I mean... have you guys never seen the 1990s ‘IT’ ??? All of these “Easter eggs” have been answers for 20+ years 😂
That's why you need to see the first one..
Ive seen some of these kids grow up from this channel lol
You missed the twins from the shining Easter egg

I love IT and I'm glad that the seqeual will be out soon.
😆 I feel so old... but I love seeing these youngins seeing the trailer, trying to figure out the story “for the 1st time”. There is a certain magic for any series when you get to see someone experience it/figure it out for the 1st time. Last month I just had my nephew ask me out of the blue “have you heard of Pokémon?”....lil dude I’ve been a trainer since the 90’s. Just showing him some of like the classic cards, how far they’ve come, or having a bonding moment to see the latest movie was really cool.
Seriously did you lot not watch this in the 90s everyone knows the story already
Most of them won’t even get in 😂😂

Eurovision 2019 reaction! (Final is Saturday 18th may)

I almost never rely solely on critics...I rely on audience reviews more, because they often give a really honest view of how the film made them feel. Professional critics often blather on about goofy pseudo intellectual aesthetics that really don’t affect audiences...and I also have seen evidence that some critics are (cough) motivated to either pan or praise a film. I def trust many of my friends, because my friends know my taste in films, and will give me a review based on what they know I’m looking for.

REACT TO NOW UNITED PLEASE
Who are these teens I feel old now? I joined the club when nowadays young adult team was the teen team. Anyways I LOVED the first movie and I’m totally going to see the second one.
Haha this was my favorite React To video 😂😂 it’s hilarious and completely the same as mine
In 6:50 the older movie beverlys tea had blood in it
4:44
This is it!
I was 8 when I saw IT why are teens scared
I’ve seen Bill Skarsgård in town like 3 times. Just casually walking.
Teens react to Child’s Play 2019 Official Trailer 2!!!!!
Awesome 👏
9:28 hurts my little x-men heart
FUN FACT: pennywise went hell and back
In the original the tea is blood
I thought this was the react channel, not the over react channel
I’m guessing none of them have read the book...
Teens are stupid. They'll think anything this dumb is scary. Losers
Matthew 16 : 24-25 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."
Wtf that's on my birthday
That Paul bunyan statue was defiently based off of the statue in Bangor, the town where Stephen king lives. (I've been there)
react to teens react to grim
Be careful Bev. You’re in Derry and if you don’t die, YOU FLOAT! They all float when dealing with Pennywise the dancing clown.🤡💀🎈
Stephen King also said that the Dark Tower movie was gonna be good. Usually when he loves something it's bad and when he hates something it's good. His movie and TV show taste is awful. Everything that he promotes on Twitter is terrible.
My teacher was the mvp she letted us watch the 1st IT movie in her laptop
Thanks Miss Arlyn!
WHAT IS IT WITH NAKED GRANDMAS

Lol I died at that part 😂😂😂
They shoulda watched the first ever IT movie thoughhhh I'm younger than them yet I know what happened-
FYI To see an R-rated movie, you must either be 17 or older, or you must have a parent or guardian with you.
She said her father Joined the circus i think I.T is her father
Anak yg pake baju biru yg milih ga nonton kobe banget sih sok sok an ga mau nonton karena sok sok an ngikutin idealis penulisnya yeewwhhh
Oh hell no And Oh hell yeah
GTFO hahahaha
8:23 lmao I thought the lumberjack had something to do with gravity falls
3:38 Jaxon 💀
Why Jaxon reminds me of Jaeden Lieberher?
Joker teaser trailer reaction please....
Who is agree with me?
this trailer is intense, different with other, but i hate horror film tho, i haven't watch the first IT,  not because of i'm scared.  but everytime after i watched movie, it always hunt me hahah lol,  no one asked this.. but i just tell it anyway
It chapter 1 was an awesome movie, not that scary, but still my favorite movie, but it seems as though they where saving all the creepy for this chapter.
FBE I love
Scrolling through the comments so i wont get terrified
Mans didn’t even see the first one
Omg îs so scary😂
The old woman is scary her walk is from MAMA
he reminds me of Tony Blair
They turn out to be dumb teenagers
Omg the hot teens girls look soo cute
I can’t  be the only thirteen year old that saw it with only my cousins and sister in our house (even tho it’s r rated) and didn’t think it was scary....
who else is looking at the comments while listening to this video?
Pennywise or "It" can lay eggs, so it is possible for him/her to make baby's
Am I the only one who is not hyped for this one and thought that chapter 1 was absolute shit?- 
Like I didn't like it at all and it wasn't scary either.
hellu
4:44
Why is everyone surprised that they come back as adults? Like has no one read the book?!
The OG soo gudd, dis looks promising
As we seen in the first movie the kids fear is what mad pennywise more powerful now that Beverly showed fear of the old lady
3:38
it’s not R it’s MA....???
My best friend told me how much the original scared her so when I was like 12 (9 years ago) I searched everywhere for the film and finally ordered it off eBay and loved it. I’m so glad they’ve made the remake so well since a lot of horror remakes are crap. And I’m so excited for part 2.
THIS IS WHY!!!  THIS IS WHY I AM AFRAID OF CLOWNS!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Did you have to get teens from the suburbs? 🤮
7:44 ????? What
It wasnt rated r? It was rated MA but i think it should have been M because to a 12 yr old i wasnt even scared accept for the painting lady
7:43 
mAybE beInG penNywisE goEs tHrOuGh tHe fAmiLy oR somEthIng




Or maybe that is Pennywise????
I watched the first one and I loved it and I'm supe excited for this AHHH! What's it rated? (I'm twelve btw)
They really should see the TV adaptation too.
I’m really excited for this movie.... why am I?!
nakey grandmau
Jessica is so hot!!!
"I don't want to watch it in theaters, because then I can't pause it"😳😂😂

That's a kid answer!🤗
3:38
Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend reading the novel. The 2017 movie was incredible in my opinion but not nearly as good as the book. Super excited to see if this sequel includes more plot elements and characters and scariness from the book.
Is anybody else watching this instead of the actual trailer because its not as scary when people are reacting to IT :)
This is R rated?! What the fuck it aint even scary and im 14..
When the first one came out I was laughing the hole time during the movie.
2 days before my birthday😂
I’m 26 years old and I remember my dad showing me the original it movie so it’s very interesting to watch another generation react to the fact that they’re grown-ups in the second part of the movie
So the movie is gonna be released on MY Birthday!??
Everyone loves that  Winnie the Pooh “hello” at the end lol
If u look at 1:47 u can see that her left eye is on Beth, and her other eye is look at us and if u see at the end of the trailer, u can see pennywises eyes r the same thing and that's how yk it's pennywise
I’m too scared to watch the trailer on my own so I’m watching it through the reaction 😬😬😄
3:38 I like how this kid didnt give any shit and just watched it cooly
4:44
1:53 cuts to Dylan saying absolutely nothing for five seconds straight
3:08 second cut of Dylan doing nothing
Let's wait 60 years and redo the same people in this show and we'll call it teens react to being old as fuck
People are wondering how they made a naked grandma scary

Naked grandmas are always scary I mean if I saw one I’d scream
hellooooo


it wasnt scary, but i do LOVE the trailer . love clowns and i hope it goes all out
What's with the tea, Sis?
Why this fbe
Pennywise hears mumble rap for the first time and leaves willingly!!!!
I love IT
You guys missed how deep the ladys voice was in the beginning while pennywise was transitioning into her
Kids react to Joker trailer and easter eggs except it's a try not to get scared challenge.
all the teens are saying i think its pennywise  think its pennywise and im here ike i know its pennywise i wathed the tim curry movie i know how tht encounter goes down i also know that one of the losers is gonna die
I actually love this trailer so much.
"easter egg on 4:44"


i smell something fishy here
Who else went straight to the easter eggs
I feel that the grandma might have been a victim but died young and it interrupted how she looked
12:54

I agree with that

Thats why i have to go to the cinema alone 8 of 10 times because pretty much nobody likes the same movies as me
i wasn’t scared when i watched the movie, i was literally sobbing my soul out
love IT
Please sub to me ill show me toes at 100k hope i can make it to that by 2070 :(
When Soundtracks are more scary than actual movie
I've started listening to the audio book to prep for the new movie. Y'all, it's 45 hours long. Buckle in for a long ride, if you're going to read it😂
How come no one said anything about how she said eyeballs. Ewyebawls
Why do horror movies have the best soundtracks and trailers?!
hello
It makes me sad that people havent seen the original lol
Whattt?? And R rated film is a 15 here in the U.K.   🤣    Can’t wait to see Chapter 2 🙌
They all wanna float 🤡
To the theater...
"What's with movies with naked grandmas."
Well, for one, they were both adapted from books of the same author.
The way ya'll ignored Mike like the first Movie did just sends... he was actually an important character even though he's treated like he isn't.
i feel like most of these teens didn't know shit about the IT story at all lol.
Yeah but when are you guys reacting to A Whole New World?
Yeah that's f*** up what it 
did to little Georgie
Am I the only person who thought it chapter one was more comedic than scary? Personally this kind of style was more in line with the books than the idea that "Steven King made a terrifying book". He knows that the reader (audience) needs relief. This is why he is such a good writer.
Okay, it’s cool and all that we got the trailer, but let’s be real here. The January embers poem is some straight up hot garbage
9 on trending good job
I love Marlhy's hair.
the first one seemed more like a buddy comedy than a horror. it was alright at best. but i have much higher hopes for this one, it looks pretty cool.
Haven’t even seen the first one. Oh well 🤷🏽‍♂️
The lumber jack looked like the one from gravity falls
Why do you always place shocked faces as thumbnails. Try something new.
Hello lmaoo
those waves tho
The awkward pause and stare gave me chills...
The old lady basically dancing by in the shadows is hilarious
First one was a POS. This trailer seems way better than the first hopefully it lives up
You'll Float Two.
fuck off
I’m reading the book.






I’m only in 6th grade
Just saying not too sure but pretty sure another ester  egg that they didn’t catch was that the old lady is  the librarian in the first movie and she gets closer to the camera each tome in one scene
Dont forget the naked gma in,  The Visit! If yaw didnt see it,  its a must see.
3:37 WTH, HE IS PENNYWISE!
2:12 this man is a legend 🏃‍♂️
Teens react to Godzilla final trailer
I let my 9 and 3 year old watch it... They watch it daily they love it. I was also a horror fan baby like my children ... All I would watch as a young child and my whole life is horror movie's ....
when you forget your towel
3:37 
When i get caught in the kitchen at midnight
Fucking jaxon 😂 ” Helllo...🙂”
Did she said that she was in the front row?? Gurl I'm praying 4 ur neck
Looks like the horror genre finally realized what scares the shit out of people .... Old people naked...always has and will be scary
It is Its voice when he opens the door
I like IT because it actually has a great story and characters, like it actually cares more than just a few cheesy jump-scares. And is actually kinda creepy, since there are more ways to make someone scared or unsettled than just jump-scares. And they have Easter eggs from the book and mini series, which makes it seem more like they put thought and effort into it.
Who sits in the "front row" rip
9:35 isn’t that professor X?
The flies... The Exorcist, Amityville Horror
10:52 my girl you didn't expect middle schoolers to curse
Thats like not expecting that Richie dies in the 2nd film😳😳😳oops didn't mean to spoil
the only thing i hope for this movie is just a tim curry cameo
Damn the trailer is scarier than the “IT” chapter one
BOUT TIME!!!! :)
when the old lady crossed the room naked*

reddit: when you hop outta shower and forgot the towel.
Most of the movie I just got bored and thought it is a bit like a comedy than a horror
Put an SH in front of IT...What do you get?..about right.
Honestly, did ANYONE really read the Fucking book?
I love Marlhey's hair
3:38  Jaxon:  h e l l U
Wasn’t Jason that’s age 15 in the kids react wow he’s now moved into FBE
7:45 “so maybe it’s like being pennywise passes down through the family or something”





BOI
She was molested by her father, kids now days..



Slow.
Kids react to Van Halen
Woe Dylan’s voice is so deep now and I love Marlhy’s new hair colour
I hate clowns 😵
my mans bray bray lookin stellar 🥵🤩
lol who else watched the reaction cause they where too scared to watch the trailer
Am I crazy or does the grandma sound like Bill Skärsgard when she answered the door?
Even if you’ve seen the original series you’d know a lot of the Easter eggs
my mom does not like R movies but if they are just scary and no bad words or sex its fine
Just for once I'd like to be scared by a movie. I haven't been truly scared by a movies in over 10 years. The closest I got was the bear scene from Annihilation.
Okay I see my mans with them waves 🌊
This movie was mostly filmed in my small Canadian town. It was such a good experience, I even met bill hader
*sees It Chapter two reactions:


Ah shit, here we float again.
React to lil uzi vert!
0:31 i wanna cuddle and watch it with ANAHITAAAAAAAAAAA Mmmmmmmmm <3 <3 <69
R they gonna ignore the whole first movie. Like this is a remake u already know half of the story plot if uve seen it which is so sad that there are like 10 kids here at least who’ve never even seen it
Who else read all 1200+ pages of the book
i think her tea turns into shit or something in the book HAHA
Everyone else is so scared while here I am, laughing my ass off. Am I a psychopath?
The way she said "saw sum eyebulls"
When you in trouble and try to avoid your teacher 2:11
Penny wise is not IT. He’s just a form IT takes on.
yall aren’t allowed to dis on the teaser trailer if you haven’t read all 1,200 pages of the book
"Shining has a naked grandma, this has a naked grandma ...what's with horror movies with naked grandmas?" ...well both does have the same author 🤔
7:16 ... When I talk? Every sentence has a question mark at the end of it? With an upward inflection? At the end of every sentence?
Who else saw the old IT movie?
Uggg I hate how no one knows anything about IT.
“It’s really cool...”
Behind the scenes lady: Because a kid stabbed it in the last one.
Clues: points to the grandma being it.
Girl: Wounds must be past down by generations.
Check out our MOVIE REVIEW WEBSITE at @t
the grandma when she walks naked is me sneaking to the kitchen
Penny wise is a female spider like being. Y u calling her him
The easter eggs are almost wrong, like the "something is up w her tea" could lead to people thinking "poisoning." But in the older adaptation, it's actually sewer water and not tea, so this movie could be adapting that as well? Idk if it's just me that's bothered by the miscommunication of the fbe writers? like check deep into the facts?
HELLLOOOO.....😆
👈SUBSCRIVE
I forgot who but one of the girls said that a lot of movies were completely different from the books and I immediately thought of Percy Jackson
Bill Hader, HELL YEAH!

Other kid immediately after: HELL NO
still mad about how they all didn't catch the face in the doorway peeking out at 2:33
I wonder if part of Beverley’s story ark will have anything to do with the child gangbang
Oooooooooooo nooooooo noooooo noooo
The new IT and old are ass asf tbh, if you think that crap is good then you really don't know horror. Horrible story, horrible...
Old lady starting at you creepily
checks to see if video is paused
A lot of ppl are talking about which movie is better 2017 or 2019 but no one is talking about the original one
It would have been better to show this to the adults or college kids cause this is pretty....boring? They didnt watch the classic ne, they didnt read the book and they didnt even watch the pt 1 like wtf???
That was Ben that stabbed pennywise in the back
Not trying to be mean but Reina looks like the moon face emoji
I read the book, and I'm hoping the second movie lives up to my expectations.
So have none of these teens ever read the book? If they had read the book they would know that the kids are now adults.
To all the teens that chose their friends’ option over the AUTHORS’!

🤦🏻‍♀️🙄 

I’m still looking for the loser emoji......
When the boy and Pennywise both said “HELLOOO” 😂💀 3:38
When someone says the book is better than the movie I usually reply with yes but when it comes to IT the book will be more messed up than the movie
Bill hader is 100% the best choice for Richie
I was 8 when I watched IT

I’m cooler than all you kids. 





Hiya Georgie! I’m Pennywise! Pennywise the dancing clown!
Wait...
Do you smell the popcorn? And the circus, Georgie?
It creeps me the peeking scene
No offense to the teens but I feel like their reactions didn’t do a justice to the trailer and the story of It itself
I’m literally 12 years old. Have read the book twice and seen the 2016 version and noticed almost all these thing the first time all these things.
2017 vs 2019 
IT.            IT2   

Vote .
1:36 foreshadowing
After this, do "Teens React To Midsommar Trailer"!
I really wish you’d do this with like actual fans
Are we just going to ignore the real f**king clowns that were running around back in 2016...
Are we all going to ignore the fact that this is a remake? Like I dont understand why they talk about this movie like we didnt knew whats gonna happen. I mean the original movie had two chapters too, why is everyone so surprised by this?
React to bad bunny plz
NEKKID GRAMAAAA!
React to bad bunny please
Just from the voice of the old lady, instantly thinks shes IT
I can’t handle this.
Y'all see that thing humping air
Not gonna lie listening to them try and break down what's going on in the trailer was rough.
I hate scary movies but because I'm reading the book I felt I had to watch the first one and now that I've seen the trailer for the second I'm excited and I now feel like I HAVE to.
Do yourself a favour, read the book.
Eeeeeek
Did anyone else avoid sewer drains when it one came out? #scaredofeverything
Do teens or adults react to Aminé
paul bunyan
I love Stephen King. The first It movie finally did his stories justice and I am excited for chapter 2!
Are we just going to ignore how big pennywise’s forehead is
oh great video !!!❤️😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yeeeeeaaaahhhhh
Estos niños jamas leyeron el libro ¿o qué? ¡Hasta lo lei en ingles para sentir mejor la narracion! ¡Y estas peliculas por muschietti son arte puro! Niños incultos :(

Any small or big Youtubers want to support each other?💜🌸
Oh yay I can scare the sh**s out of my self on my birthday...Yippee (my birthday is September 10th)
Of course the old lady is pennywise, is you dumb
2:49 What’s with horror movies and naked grandmas?
The first it wasn’t even scary.......
NO SPOILERS CUZ I WATCHED THE FIRST NOT THE SECOND
"I can tell... "
2:48 respect to that teen that knew about The Shining
Bummer it doesn't come out till September.   :●{
I remember from the book the older lady's house; that was maybe the scariest part of the book!
How do none of them know the old lady is penny wise
Me: 3:58
at school always talking about it ready to pee my pants
“There was a lot of curse words from the kids that you wouldn’t expect” IT literally gives a perfect representation of how kids act these days lmao
Pennywise was never human...the old ladies dad cant be pennywise lol please do research..
teens react to melanie martinez new teaser k-12
Couldn’t see number one but I’m totally going to see this one in theaters
The Naked Grandma is scarier than Pennywise imo. Its scary cause its a fookin naked Grandma
3:37 got me
what a bunch of losers, nobody afraid s of clowns in rest of the world
no one really cares about who sees what movies these days. i was going to the movies watching R Rated movies at 13 with friends. it’s not that deep anymore.
Helloooooo
3:38 Jaxon's "*hello*" is EVERYTHING 😂
No inglish ahre
3:38 so funny
Please do a teens react video to GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, final trailer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:39
Helloo
Can teens react to Zayn and Zhavia’s “A whole new world”?
I thought I was the only one that thought horror movies had a weird thing with naked grandmas lol.
At 3:42 he said it hello at same time as penny wise🤨
jaxon the visit had a naked grandma
With the fence post
Name one thing a robber would not want to see upon breaking into a house:

NAKED GRANDMA!
Ben stabbed Pennywise
It wasnt Mike it was Ben watch the scene again to see
PLZ REACT TO STRAY KIDS!
I absolutely LOVE all of the React videos! ❤️
my 63 year old ex-nanny took me to see It in theaters and afterward she told me how she could still vividly remember reading the descriptions of the floating children in pennywise's lair. she read it back when she was much younger (like thirty years ago) and it's fascinating how things like that stick with you.
I’m-
Naked Grandmas
READ BOOKS!
Yoo this remind me of The Visit fuckin naked GMA fuckin shit up ohhh hellll nahhh😱
Oh fuck ass no, I’m out
Le’Raun looks like a 30 year old
If you read the book you know not to trust the tea...
As soon as she open the door it was Penneywise’s did not spell the right voice was there the it changed to the old women
i love that they are making it like the original it ahhhh
I love IT and watching the IT Chapter Two trailer makes me so happy
Is the old lady in chapter 2 the same old lady in the first movie, the lady with the cat?
In the book there is definitely something wrong with the tea. If you’ve read the book you know.
I’m 12 and I’ve seen all of the movies, new and old
if there was something wrong with my tea I'd just "spill the tea"
Fear is not of the lord Jesus said that I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me 👣❤️📖📖📖✝💯😃
Jaxon is actually is cute, why can’t he go to my school!😭❤️ great vid
I love how in amercia is r-rated but in England its a 15...
Why are some of them suprised that their older it like the original not saying I'm mad or hating them just that surprised me
Some other examples of authors of books that've been made into movies that they hated include:
P.L. Travers (Mary Poppins (1964))
Roald Dahl (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971))
E.B. White (Charlotte's Web (1973))
Michael Ende (The NeverEnding Story (1984))
Norton Juster (The Phantom Tollbooth (1970))
3:37 HeLLo 😂
It's It!
I saw it the first one and  I'm 11
19mil!!!
Do a reaction to Stranger Things 3 trailer!
And I’m done I’m just done😂 save meee😭😭😭
Edit: is “IT” chapter 2  actually gonna come out or is just a lie because I rlly wanna see it even I don’t no what it is rated. Probably way to under age to watch “IT” chapter 2 but imma see it thanks to my dad😁
Teens should react to Melanie Martinez k-12 Movie Trailer
2:49 Visit had a naked grandma
i’m turning 17 less than a month before it comes out and now i can FINALLY SEE SOMETHING GOOD IN THEATERS
Honestly, I've seen so many horror movies, so now they can't scare me anymore.
I was really hoping one of the them would point out that the actor playing grown up Mike was the same guy who does the Old Spice commercials!!! XD
Do they not realize pennywise is pretty much a shapeshifter? Because they thing the old woman is his daughter
Like for marlhy
pennywise appears
Jaxon: in sync with pennywise 
HilOo
i feel like it’s wrong for them to make an IT 2 because they created IT which was the remake of the original one. and in the original one it said he comes back like every 27 years or something like that and they made the remake that many years later. But now they are making an IT 2 which doesn’t make sense to me and it feels wrong to me
💲♦I would really appreciate it if some ppl could drop me a sub just reply done and i promise I will sub back♦💲
I DIED when Jaxon said hello with Pennywise lol
Lol she the grandma looks like she fortnite dances at 2:42
https://youtu.be/GK1WpPT5g4k
No cap, the old woman looked like she was doing fortnite dances at 2:46
Omg I'm reading the book currently and it's sorta painful to watch them try and explain what's happening 🤣
so no one is going to talk abt how this old woman kinda resembles the woman in the background of the library scene in the first movie????
#nakedgrandmaphobia
I saw this but I didn't think it was the it trailer, it mentioned Derry but I forgot what Derry was from
2:54 Not all of them. Just the Stephen King stories.
"time to dip" lol he knows what's good
my ipad is cracked
The visit naked grandma
Naked grandma gave me the visit chills
I want everyone reading this to fuck the like button till its blue
Where is Shaggy?
I understand these teenagers. They are teenagers after all.
Like all teens (including my generation in the Stone Age) they are somewhat uninformed and shallow and selfcentered.
Its ok.
They will go see the flick.
They will enjoy it on their own terms.
After all, "we all float down here". 🎈🤡🎈
"There were a lot of curse words there, especially from the little kids, you wouldn't expect that" um...go to litterally any school and you'll hear alot, for me it first started happening in 4th grade
"Maybe being Pennywise passes down through the family I guess" WHAT?
LOVE IT
"Is Pennywise the old lady?" Yeah no shit, it's freaking obvious people. He's a shapeshifter that's how he gets his prey.
I haven't watched the other IT movie IT 2 might seem good if there will be an IT 3 I might watch it 1 then it 2
These kids clearly haven't seen the original. Hopefully, this one ends better.
What's with the weird filter that highlights their faces?
I hate the fact that they’re all reacting to the fact that Beverly’s older. If they even knew about the miniseries or the books, they would know. Remember, something happens in Derry every 27 years. Do your research kids
it physically hurts me to hear them try to break it all down when u know what’s happening
So fucking stocked the first one wasn't even scary but this one seems juicy I can't wait!!! I hope the 3 years was worth the wait!!
It comes out one day before my birthday too so it's like a early bday gift 😁
Subscribe On my Momma❗️New Video I POURED SYRUP ON HER WHILE IN THE SHOWER😂 (SHE HATES ME)https://youtu.be/f-YshKkJIRA
Please notice how the trailer's epic music is the same as Avengers' bruh, Imma hunt down the score maker and talk about this problem lol
The only things I really liked about the first one was the kids personalities and the horror meets Goonies tone of the movie. Most of the other characters INCLUDING PENNYWISE were poorly done imo.
I will be watching the sequel though.
Two of my favorite things combined: HAPPINESS
4:17 um I don’t think it’s possible for a film that isn’t finished now to come out in the past
0:09

Yooo, his voice changed dramatically 💀😳
Yo that one dudes eyes are 👌🏼👌🏼😰😰👌🏼👌🏼 really nice
IT had a little bit of an Al Roker moment...
IM SOO EXICTED TO WATCH ITTTTTT   I was laughing in the first one😂
Oh he'll no
i’m honestly glad that the first trailer scene was actually from the book tho
I'm looking forward to Tommyknockers.
i read the book so i will probably be critiquing everything
Neither my mom nor my sister wanted to see the movie with me because they hate horror movies. I almost got to see the movie but the guy caught me and wouldn't let me through because I was underage. So I ended up watching a bootlegged version of The movie. It was pretty intense tho
1:14
Does that symbolize the Losers Club drifting apart?
Kids react to IT
The visit has a naked grandma too 😂
I fell out of love with Stephen King stories with The Stand. A literal deus ex machina? No.
why am i so scared watching the Trailer
4:44
Not horror movies and naked grandmas, just Stephen King and naked grandmas.
Should've gotten some better teens for this one. I'm 17, and I knew all the easter eggs from the trailer and screamed when the trailer came out. So excited for this movie, but was deeply saddened that they weren't even aware Pennywise shape shifts
Conjuring timeline/movies: we sp00ky 🥴🤩
Pennywise/IT: hold my balloon-
grandma nakey
The horror aspect in the first IT movie was terrible, i cant believe some people got scared of it, i really hope the second will be better
do adults react to it chapter two trailer
Jaxon: Ah HELL yeah babeee. 
Also Jaxon: Oh HELL NO.
Logically, if you were he last person to read this comment give me a like...

Watching this with the sound off and reading the comments
3:38 that was so on sync and I did not like that 💀
I saw the first IT movie when I was ten ( the first ever one and the 2017 one) and now I’m eleven going to watch the next one but not in theaters
I'm 13 and scared my stomach is hurting now
Is it bad that I’m 12 and I’m aloud to watch it by myself and I thought it was a great movie and it didn’t scare me one bit I’m excited to watch part 2
Am i the only one who thinks jaxson looks like the kid who plays bill?
in the 2017 version, the parents can't see any of the destruction pennywise did to them,  In the 2019 trailer, How come they are still haunted by pennywise and still seeing what pennywise is doing
“Girl put some CLOTHES on” hahaha hahahahaha
Yeah the ending from the other movie was kinda weird

I already know that this is gonna be better then the first one..
This dude like 15 and isn’t aloud to watch rated r movies when I’m out here 11 watching them
“Being Pennywise passes down through the family or something”

No, honey. That’s not how this works lol. He’s a shape shifting thing from outside of our universe. That whole story is a ruse. She IS IT/Pennywise because IT can be whatever IT wants. Pennywise is just IT’s favorite form because for some reason kids used to actually like clowns and it was a sure fire way to get a free meal.
IT is shit, just like every other scary movie. The most overrated and garbage movie genre of all time.
Where was the loser club
JESUS CHRIST IN NOT A SWEAR WORD! TO BE BORN AGAIN IS NOT A RELIGION! HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AND  PUT YOUR TRUST IN GOD! REPENT OR PERISH!!!
It was R rated is US? Wow. It was a 15 here in UK.

I read the book and I’m really happy how by the looks of things, they actually stopped to make it more or less the same, unlike in the first IT movie where it was all over the place
This trailer was #1 on trending and none has seen it
Like if it chapter 2 will be better than 1😁

OK so at dancemy friends call me Pennywise because I start I watch the first one and so I did the run that I saw on the trailer for the new were one not this one and this is just so crazy LOL

I'm sorry but the new pennywise sounds like Winnie the pooh, dnt u agree? 😂
I’m not scared of clowns







Naked old lady’s on the other hand
They act like they never seen the original where they do come back as adults, that’s just sad. Have them watch the old one
This one is scary
I watched IT last year in December on the plane. Now I'm 12. When the movie comes out I'll be 13, and I am TOTALLY WATCHING IT,
Like, I've never watched a horror movie in a movie theatre before, so this will definitely be awesome!!!
EU>NA cinema rules .. they will let 13 year olds see horror movies we don't have 18 year old range , max range is 15
Does no one remember the first film? (The og IT) also 9:48 he’s an actor now, he’s supposed to be really hot in the future
For the first time I'm excited for my birthday. I love It and cant wait for the movie to come out on my birthday 😁😁😁
The first one was ok, it definitely wasn’t scary tho. It was mostly entertaining. The only good part was when Georgie got his arm ripped off. Everything else is comical.

Teens or adults listen to homicide logic (feat.Eminen)
I’m literally 19 and know more about this movie than they do.
What's with horror movies and naked grandmas?
I hate how the teens are like “WhAT deY In FuTUrE” when they should know that the old ones literally showed them as adults to actually defeat him.

I think the old woman isn’t actually alive like penny brought her to life and or he is controlling his daughter.
Can't wait for this. The book is amazing so hope it's half as good
'its like their fears follow them' YES PENNYWISE TRANSFORMS INTO THEIR BIGGEST FEARS AHHH PLS READ THE NOVEL GUYS

I’m scared af help me
It's 2 AM 
 and I'm watching this...
@ the beginning u could hear pennywise voice b4 he shape shifted into a grandma Ew🥴
Make some original content Jesus Christ
This is the number one reason I refuse to go to the movie theater s no more I refuse to support it u until they start making movies like they used to .😁the crap  these kids nowadays found scary.
I like how people think Pennywise died in the first one
2:48 “Naked Grandma”
Steve Harvey: NAKED HUUUHHH
3:38 Helloo  😂
You should have the react cast watch the TV mini series!
YES
Seriously, why are elderly people so freaking terrifying???
Real life that grandma could be penny wise because didn’t he shapeshift in the 2017 version? Bruh I’m so excited🥵🤪
Check out the link.... subscribe to my YouTube page
This is my second most anticipated movie for the year, 1 being Endgame, I can’t wait!!  I’d happily sit through 3 hours of this!
Such a good video
She thought Georgie was gonna come back ? lol he never was there in the first place besides the beginning. And it’s not like Pennywise is “pretending to be the grandma” IT is not even Pennywise it’s just simply another form he takes. Like wearing a new hat.
3:38 lol 🤣
Oh my golly I'm so sorry FBE!!! When this video was uploaded, it was 11:00 PM in England and I was asleep then so I couldn't be there!!! Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh oh my golly I feel so bad!! 😥😥😥😱😱
the fact that his character lost weight is all due to the first movie and the book also not the fact that "when you gotta run you gotta lose weight"

NAKED GRANDMA!
I'm assuming none of these kids watched the original "IT".
Great now when the new IT comes out there’s gonna be even more people clickbaiting about getting chased by the clown

see it in IMAX!
13:48 when your new hand sanitiser smells really good
Sorry I just find it very funny that almost all of the first scene of the trailer is exactly the same as this scene in the original IT, but yet no one seems to notice. It's just funny how everyone sees the remakes but no one ever bothers to see the originals/classics. Also I think that the original IT was so much better then the remake.
wait, IS THAT DWIGHT?!
In the book the tea turns to shit!!

Why do the old ladies always give us creepy vibes in scary movies lol😂😂
The original IT movies are better than the new ones.  Penny Wise in the original is more scarier!

Fact from a good YouTuber :  Steven king was sleeping in the Stanley hotel when he had a horrible nightmare about his son being chased by a water hose and dying because it strangled him and then he went on the balcony to smoke then he thought about making  the shining

Hi
I honestly was in hysterics watching the trailer. Why the grandma run like she got an itchy butt hole. Why she naked running at beverly
PLEASE! React on "Zayn,Zhavia Ward - A Whole New World" song please! Please! Please!
I thought the trailer was pretty chill compared to the typical jump scares we see in horror clips. Anyone agree?
Can you react to Eurovision 2019 after the Grand Final?
Am I the only one who thinks the trailer was more funny than scary? A wrinkly old woman waddling and dancing like a penguin from Happy feet.



Also thankful I live in Canada, most R movies are PG-13 unless there is sex/nudity.
Omg wow

"whats with horror movies and naked grandmas?" can you honestly say naked old people aren't terrifying?
#2 on trendinggggg
the old lady IS pennywise, nobody lived in bev's house since she left. pennywise was trying to scare her.
This is funny 😂😂
It seems like none of these people have seen the original or read the book. I’m disappointed
I knew the lady was a creep when she opened the door in the dark😭😭😭
Where is the  JOKER trailer reaction god dammit
Well yeah the old lady is in fact Pennywise. I mean it's pretty clear in the book which the movie is based on.
There are two things that genuinely frighten me about this movie lol

1.) No jump scares
2.) The creepy stuff happens in the background while the camera is focused on the foreground.
i literally sneaked in the first one with 14 years, loved it, and when this is going to come out, i'm 16 and can go legally. Yay.
Ok.. Now i know thay there is no sleeping for today.. Wow
This is why i didnt want to watch the first one and the original one it gave me nightmares for days😟😟😩
I saw the first one and existed for chapter 2 but nope I ain’t going to see it
When they said they care more about what their friends think than the source material author I was like ??????????????????
6:04 I thought she made that reaction because of the woman talking about dying and sh*t, not because of the tea... Dam.
IT will be a scarier than the first movie.
In England it is only a 15 and u can go see it without a parent as long as ur 15
LOL CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT CHAPTER 2
Girl these teen's needed to watch the first one and read the book lol
12:30
Bad idea. Your friends are probably bad at watching movies. If you liked Ouija, you’re bad at matching movies. If you liked Lights Out, The Nun, La Llorona, you’re bad at watching movies.

1st IT had a dancing clown 
2nd IT now has a dancing naked old lady
You’ll float down here! 🎈 🎈

these kids had me mad frustrated lmao 😂😂
As a horror junkie, I am excited....as someone with coulrophobia, not so much😂😂
You guys, shoud react to #joker teaser trailer??
These kids have obviously not seen the original television movie.

They act so surprised when they see them grown up lol
That's 27 years later how stupid do you have to be to not figure out
The old lady IS indeed pennywise. If you’ve never read the book or seen the original TV movie thing from 1990, or don’t remember from It part I, Pennywise can shape shift. The house and the tea and the old lady, it’s all an illusion. The house is actually decaying and falling apart, Bev’s father has been dead for quite some time and after that the house was never moved into so it began to fall apart. Pennywise lured Bev into the house to attack her. After she escaped in the original, Pennywise shape shifts back into the clown and the building is shown for real, the illusion falls away. I’m excited to see how they did it in this movie.
They are 27 years older because IT comes every 27 years
I really couldn't watch it. It was my first time watching it and is to scary for me (in the beginning)
Fuck all these remakes low-key dies in Marvel's that stupid comic movies and who the fuck is Stan Lee
I dont get scared from scary movies and im 12

Maybe it's just me but ya girl got pissed watching this. Has no one read the book or actually seen both versions of the movie??  lmaaoo
I have no respect for the girl who thinks it “runs through the family” 

It is a shape shifter u idiot
Not gonna lie I’m a lil puss puss and I wasn’t scared of this -.-
I dont give a fuck about anybody i just hope the grandma doesnt die





Unless its Pennywise
The only thing disturbing about the book for me personally was Beverly and the boys having sex i mean thats fucked up im glad thats not in the film. Lik idk wtf was Stephen smoking that made his mind go perverted and shit
they are going to remake the tea scene back from the 1990
How bout the photo that shows the twins. It could be the twin from Shining
In the end :*just a dream*:(

Stephen King also said that The Dark Tower movie was good shortly before it was released. Not sure we can exactly call him reliable judge of cinema.
Pennywise shapeshifts into different people so it’s not a big shock the old women could be pennywise
0:37-0:40 😂🤣.....no you haven't sweetie...I doubt you've watched the first one that you probably weren't born when it came out!....lol!
Anyone is excited 

Like if you are
If someone spoiled it punch his face
"The first one was really scary"
It was funnier than hangover 2. But I enjoyed it anyway.
In the first Movie there wasn’t even that much swearing .
I wish I liked scary movies 😭😂
It’s interesting that it’s rated r , cause in Australia it’s rated ma.
REACT ONE OK ROCK

.... ya think you can tell kids that the original "IT" from the book and the 90s version with Tim Curry, does the whole 27 years thing too. 

Since they have no idea and seemed so shocked by it.
HOLY FUDGE CAKES, WHY DOES THIS MOVIE COME OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!
Im guessing they have never watched the old IT
I’m guessing some of these kids never even watched the first reworked IT 😂 Like that stab wound on the old lady was a dead giveaway if you paid attention to the movie.
Jaxon's "hello"😂
3:37 Jaxon istg
Being in the first row at the movies is the dumbest thing ever

Hi
I saw this hours after release. In the book, IT was known as Robert Gray. Finally, 30 years in the making and he's finally here.
2:16 GTFO stands for “Get the F**k Out”
happy 19 million subscribers!
I want to see some spooky scary pennywise dancing😂💀
It took me two years to finish the book (in my 20's), I kept getting too scared and had to take breaks :(
This is like Dragon Ball Z Kai, but with good music, all of the screentime and good voiceactors
3:37 LMAOOOOO

Never watched it but definitely love the trailer for sequel so time to watch
I watched a lot of clips of it, so technically I watched the movie
Life hack
I watched and learned that one of the kid died as adult. I really hope the ,live version they all survived
Stephen King liking it doesn't bode well. Go watch the TV mini-series version of The Shining that he was in charge of. It was terrible.
I'm 13 and this trailer seemed more like a comedy than a horror😂
Do a try not to laugh challenge but with key and peele skits !!

Can u plzzzzzz do teens or adults react to childs play2 2019 plzzzz
I read the book in my early 20's in broad daylight working at a hotdog stand and I don't think I've been so scared in my life.
I liked jaxin how he watch silently without talking :)
The naked gramma scene reminds me of ‘the visit’
Unpopular opinion:
IT one wasn’t really that scary 🤷‍♀️
We all know that, the old lady is more scary than our little Penywise.
Let me tell u something

Jordan looks abit different. She's getting more beautiful.
Why does no one realise Pennywise can take the form of whatever he wants?
3:22 and 3:25
Jordan is like one of my favorite human being
did no one pick up 2:36 ?
I didn't watch the first one so I think I have a big job now
I got mad when she called pennywise it
I just hope that they would still react to FANCY  MV
even though it is nearly 1 month old
It may help them gain more audience for their world Tour. I hope fBE would give them a chance to react to FANCY MV by TWICe
1:53 he’s cute.. why you do this ;-;
I think the first sene we saw is a dream bc she would not die in the beginning
Imagine someone just walking in the theater dressed as pennywise and his balloons in the middle of the movie
The book. Ultimate teaser trailer. Enough said.

Read the book... the movie is just following it...smh
What if pennywise really controls that statue?
When a movie based on a book actually follows the book... something magic happens. People actually start to LIKE the movie.
SOOO CREPPY😂😂😂
It's a little sad that none of these teens have seen the original adaptation.
Jaxon’s mood is me .
What if the grandma is related to granny the game u know :O
Im definitely watching that with my family!!!😄😄😄
Somebody needs to show these kids the original TV special.
Jaxon (I don't know did I spell it right) voice change a lot

First off FBE your video's are great, don't tell me to skip parts 😂 second, did that girl really say it was shocking to see so many parents with kids watching the first one? Got to remember those parents were big fans of the original so of course they would take their kids to see the remake 😉
movie already out on pirate bay so that's just funny it's cam so sometimes u dont see shit because its too dark though
3:38 You are no poppy
do not read my profile picture
Totally not scared 🥺
I've learned not to "trust" anyone's recommendation.  Authors have a vision, sure, but it's still just one person's vision.  A lot of people work on adapting these stories into movies, and while they may cut things the author likes, they'll also cut things that make no sense or don't go anywhere or really don't relate to the story at all.  You can't trust critics because they get paid to give reviews, and that means their livelihood depends on them giving the reviews they think will work best for *them*.  As for my friends, we all have such different tastes in entertainment that it's rare I'll even ask them what they thought of the movie until after all of us have seen it already.
It’s funny that in the Uk IT was only a 15 , because I was 15 when it came out and I went to see it in the cinema. 

Is cool to see how films are categorised differently depending where you live.

I never go by what the critics say. I can't tell how many times they've said a movie was terrible, but I liked it, and vice-versa.

2:01   1:03   3:27
over reacting much
How about the Joker trailer?
I hate that "you can't do that because you are underage" thing that you have in the USA. I'm from Spain and I have been watching horror movies since I was literally 13 and no one has ever told me not to see them, not even my parents. USA parents, stop putting barriers between your kids and reality. They are not going to get a trauma for seeing a horror movie with 15-16 years old.

Maksudny apa dh?yg ktny di suruh skip ke 4:44 buat easter egg dr trailerny?w gk ngerti wkwk
Brayden took my heart🥺 What he’s so precious tssss
I have seen the movie it chapter 1 and 2 cuz i saw the one from the 90s and chapter 1 from 2017 and im only 10
As someone who’s read the book multiple times I can say the trailer does show a lot of assets from the book
10:20 But we do it anyway. 😂😂😂😂😂
React to the Joker trailer.
2:33 Who just knew that she was looking at her
Jaxon's see n this before! 3:37
Good to see Brayden!!!
I think to understand the little hints in the movie you have to read the book first. My dad said that, he read the book and told me I should do it too. But i’s like 900 pages or something because they have the first one and the seciond one togheter, I have to read it but I won’t be able to sleep at night.
FBE should have a screening of the original IT mini-series for these kids. Sure it's not hardcore like the new movies but they may like it.
That’s how it be
That old lady was dropping serious hints like the whole time. Beverly should’ve ran, forget the lady
Has no one seen the mini series they did in 1990? I mean obviously the new movie isn’t going to be exactly like the mini series but still 🤷🏻‍♀️
That old lady is more scary than pennywise
What the.. There are comments from 30 seconds ago...
he''s a guy from split ?
dude that's prof xavier
my god help me i cant finish it
It isn’t that spooky .. i don’t get the hype
Pennywise has many personality
Fun fact, you can hear pennywise voice when the old lady first starts talking.

Bruh, True IT Fans should've been chosen to react.
In the first movie when Georgie’s arm got bit off the old lady saw its the same old lady
I wanted to say something about critics vs friends opinion of movies. Ive seen a few movies where critics said they were amazing, but they were actually terrible.
0:22 6:41
I hate how the guy said 'i think he realised when he gotta run he need to get fit'
React to iKON please!
I’m lowkey so excited to watch this
The woman who played Lois in the DCEU should have been adult Beverly. Also, if you listen to what critics say over your friends you are a brainless dipshit.

“oh OH breaking gender roles 😂”
Malificent 2 trailer
MABeY the Gramama IS IT o
There adults They would not be sceard like I’m not

They should have seen the 90’s version. DUH!! moments.
MY movie
Family Fued: Ding. Naked Grandma!!!

Us: NOOOO
The nun : I'm a scariest cosplay in the world
Pennywise : hold my red baloon

This is IT
I love that I watched IT chapter 1 when I was just 10 years old and I was so excited that IT chapter two was coming.😄
Okay I'm excited for IT 2 yèeey

Hehe see wat i did there.
React to scary stories to tell in the dark trailer
Clown
Welp,I better ready before I got forced watching thiz..
Yeaaass finally this would be awesome to watch in the movies, with the giant a** screen and the guy sitting beside you screaming like hell, yes that would be amazing
9:46 lol
SO NONE  OF THEM HAD SEE THE THE 1990'S ADAPTATION AND THEY DONT KNEW ABOUT THAT TIME JUMP
Funny thing that happened after watching It: Chapter 1 in theaters, a red balloon happened to come floating from behind my house into the car port, and back around the house, then a few minutes later floated back around to us in the car port, and back behind the house, and when we went to check behind the house, the balloon was gone!! I was very excited!! Also, I haven’t read the book yet, but I saw the original film, so I’m so excited to see the trailer following the first movie so closely!! More interested in reading the book now!! The fact that Steven King is excited makes me so much more excited to watch it when I comes to theaters!! I loved this film growing up, and love the remake even more so!! Much Excite!! But everyone could tell me it sucked and I’d still watch it!!
YASSSSSS, I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
Don’t care what anyone says, but bill skarsgard has to go down as one of the greatest horror icons of all time.
Umm It chapter 2 or it lives was already shown here like a long time ago...
FBE Teens React To Ikon K-Pop
Hello
the fact that there was barely a reaction to bill hader being on the cast......these teens need to educate themselves smh
Y'all should React to Star Wars Scene 38 Reimagined
They obviously have never seen the original movies 😂
When she walked across the doorway naked LMFAOO
Tbh FBE should get the adults reacting to the new trailer better. I feel like the adults can appreciate it more, as some of them have watched the original 1990s series or read the book.
Guys, C'mon... "Joker" trailer...  We want the jokeeeeeeeeeeeeeer.......
Dude the kid in react looks like georgie's brother no lie
the only reason im commenting, is bcuz i can see 3 people that commented under a minute ago, so....... hey!
It's not horror movies and naked grandma, it's Stephen King and naked grandma
I never notice in the original trailer that someone is watching Beverly at 2:33
I was waiting for them to make a video of people reacting to IT Chapter 2. I’m so excited to see it 👍🏼🥰💞
3:38 made me laugh so hard, I wasn't expecting that lol
Has nobody seen the original movie, Lol you're doing it all wrong
I LOVE FINN WOLFHARD
College kids React to motionless in white
I'm not a teen
It the book is in two bits but in one piece and it is when the losers club are adults and when they are fighting It and It only appears once every 27 years and the children made a promise ( cutting themselves ) and when the 27 years come back then they return to Derry
Sad that no one read the book
Can y’all do a parents react to Flatbush zombies or jid ?

I Knew That Pennywise Would Comeback Because When He Fell It Didn't Show Him Fully Disappear
react to aurora
0:58 my grandma can’t do that dance...😭
Does that mean one of them is going to commit suicide?
3:37 damn that impression was on point hahah
I always thought Jaxon was 1 year younger than me.. This convinced me he is legit a year older than me.
Is it bad that ive never watched the first one and the second one is already planned to come.
im pretty sure Jaxon is friends with Jack Grazer (Eddie kaspbrak)
“HeLLoOo”
You missed an Easter egg, When she knocked On the door the door still said ‘Marsh’
But yeah.. This film would never be as intense as the book. A bunch of kids thinking that Pennywise only comes after kids and not adults, and therefore end up having 11 year old Bev letting the whole group fuck her. Yup.. That wasn't going in any version then or now 😁
FINALLY
Jaxson be like "Hellu"
Am gonna float too... Can't wait to watchhhhhh
IT better be good.
I tought the first movie was boring, but I have high hopes on the second one.
What about Godzilla?
“Hell yeah” “hell no...”
The music the old lady plays is a danish song called det er det skønneste jeg ved or its The most Beautiful thing I know and I love horror films so I’m ready for this one the trailer didn’t scare me but I hope the hole film will
7:46 wat??
Teens or College kids react to Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil 😊

11:09 Same.
React to Matt Corby yo!!
2:27 this boy bro he cute tho🤠👊
Gotta wonder if Pennywise will show his true form at the end of the movie. Yes, I read the book. :)
Just finished rewatching the first one!
This trailer got me spooooooked! Agh the background of the old lady running around naked is so creepy😩😭
React to I don’t care by ed sheeran feat. Justin bieber
I don’t remember all the characters names but when she said “in chapter one mike stabs pennywise” I paused and said “his name is Richie 
I could be wrong.... or she has been watching Stranger Things ;)))
It's pretty obvious that It was the grandma. Pennywise is just a form of It. It is the character.
500 Subs to 19 Million
I’ve never seen part 1 but I thought everybody knew that pennywise is a shapeshifter or something like that ....
I hv Coulrophobia but I still watched it better than any of those girls and tbh if they watched the first one they should know that he can change his forms.... Lack of knowledge is really hitting here
3:38 HELLOU
This is gonna be GOOD!!!
I thought it was obvious that the old lady was pennywise I mean he can shape shift
I also Said that they should React to it 2 trailer
Stephen King looking like cat in a hat
7:19 It is the mark that penny wise get when they are still young back then. I think that scar or wound when they stabbed penny with a metal pipe? Remember that scene?
you're finally an adult congrats but its just another step in life to become the greatest person u can be there wouldn't be a world without u FBE and reina love u all guys
I bet none of them read the book or seen the original 2-part television series, cause mostly all the stuff they talk about is in there, like the old lady, that IS Pennywise, there's no speculation about it
Teen react to Maleficent sequel

I got all the references to the fist IT because I loved the first one, and I right away knew that IT was the old lady because I remembered when Mike impaled IT and it's a shapeshifter.
Penny: Hello
Me: Nope you better get your ass back in that sewer drain
React to The Act
Tumblr fandom yall watching this?
10:36 He's definitely seen the movie but is saying no because parents may be watching. The head nod even confirms it!
Can you imagine watching this movie on acid
It makes me so sad these kids didn't already they would be adults in the next movie. Hollywood is literally reselling the same stuff over again.
I cant tell ya'll how bad I wanna explain everything to them 💀
I literally live a hour away from where they filmed the movie. I tried to be an extra in the film by auditioning but didn’t make it.

So looking forward to this film.
Adults react to I don’t care by Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber!!
Wow, none of these kids seemd to watch the original it’s😂
Yall kiddos should watch the OG It with Tim curry. 

That's real fear, because of that I never wanted to see these new ones.
I'm almost 30 and I cannot close my eyes in the shower still or walk near storm drains.
you should watch the eurovision LIVEEE and also scoring for the reactors!!!
React to Stranger things 3 trailer
there's not enough light in this episodes... so dim...
7:45 are u fucking stoopid
5:40 really?
Fine if you haven't read the book, but to not know the story at all is so weird. They're going, oh she might be Pennywise in disguise.. Hey kids.. Newsflash PENNYWISE DOESN'T EXIST EITHER, IT'S IN THE NAME.. IT.
We're dealing with something that can be anything it wants, so it can be a clown for some kids, or a snake.. Or a statue or even your little sister. Whatever It needs to be to drag you down to it's kingdom. These react kids are not getting IT literally 😔
Did she just say GTFO instead of Get The Fuck Out??
Teens react to Batman vs the teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trailer
Why does it seem like these people don't know the there's an original film of this that exists?
Hahah naked grandma,hey guys remember the answer on the who wants to be a millionaire 
The question was what would a thief or introder wouldn't like to see when he enters a living room 
He answered naked grandma
shouldn't have done teens for this one. they don't appreciate/know the films enough and it hurts watching it. should've had college or adults smh
2:51 Because everybody knows that naked old ladies are the scariest thing ever
Has no one watched the original, they all were surprised they were older
Who else got the ma trailer before this like if did!

10:51 ya like this part is in the trailer of it chapter 1 so no spoilers when they jump into the water from that cliff into the water beverly was first i think it was Richie who said oh fuck in a really hilarious way
A bit too dim-lighted.
Nice
So i have Coulrophobia and idk why i am watching this
11:12 Such a dumb person.
Nothing beats then a crazy naked woman chasing you.
can they react to an anime called "the promised neverland" ?
Its pretty interesting.
That dumb bish🤦🏽‍♂️ what was the point in killing Georgie ! Omg ! Its not some DISNEY MOVIE!!! 😂 Georgies arm was bitten off and dragged in the sewer by a demonic monster that ate him. Sure he’s still alive 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I am actually reading the book right now and It's digital form on my kindle and I'm only at 15% I hope to have IT done by September. Believe me if you read a Stephen King book you'll be on it for awhile he likes to write very long books. Another example The Stand.
I can't wait to see the movie try to explain that Pennywise is an ancient intergalactic giant spider 🤡
Shining had a naked grandma , this has a naked grandma ,what's with horror movies and naked grandma's legit cracked me up
It hurts that they don’t know that Georgie was gonna be permanently dead, the old lady is IT, and that they next movie is focused on them as adults.
jaxon my kiiiiiing

I would never be invited to any REACT VIDEO, because I always watch the trailers quietly and paying attention to them.
The trailer music is just like Avengers Infinity War trailer.
Why am I watching this right before I'm going to bed? (Love the vids by the way)

Critics panned the original star wars trilogy so sorry to say they really don't know what they're talking about when it comes to movies as the original trilogy is such an amazing story and classic
“breaking gender roles” pretty sure pennywise is a female in the book but i could be wrong. it’s been a while since i’ve read it
So psyched for this, it looks even creepier than the first one, which was pretty damn creepy 😨
Do a react to Vivziepop next! "Die Young" or "Silhouette"! Both are fan animations!
i……… haven’t seen the 1st one
Stephen King doesn't translate well to movie from book because he uses so many details in his writing. It's hard to put them into the movie.
Its clear that most of them didn’t read the book

      👞
11:22 I feel that☹️
scariest part of this trailer is the naked grandma
wow im early
I wish they'd gotten more accurate with the book, but, obviously, leave out the child sewer orgy. Because really, did Stephen King have some drug in his system when he wrote it? Yes, pun intended.
My dumba** thought this was gonna come out 27 years later, just like It. I guess not.

Becca is so smart and beautiful. 😍
I’m pretty sure the old lady being pennywise was confirmed in the trailer ?? That seemed pretty clear, we’ve already seen him shape-shift
Jordan is ❤
To be honest I covered the whole clip because I hate clowns
Read the book it's so good and scarier then the films in my opinion.
Some these people fr know nothing bout I.T.
that final frame of pennywise gave me chillsssss

Please have the adults react to the trailer!
How can they not bring up to the teens about the miniseries
I CAN'T WAIT
Teens react to JOKER Trailer, please!
I wonder how faithful they'll be to the book... I know they left out one controversial part of the book in the first movie but are they going to show us the cosmic turtle entity that vomited the universe
If you read the book or watched the mini series from the 80s, you already know where that scene was going with the old lady. It still scared the shit out of me.
This is gonna be way scarier than chapter one
Ok, I love Jaxon 😂😂😂
Can you do team fortress 2
Stephen king has a thing for scary naked grandmas
Funny how they act this isnt a reboot lol. There all surprised that there older
Can't wait 😍
ok but are y’all forgetting that they have that group orgy in the book
Wow it's funny that people think that It/penny wise is a man. Only true It fans will understand.
Jaxon, a naked grandma is a terrifying and traumatic thing 😲
Oh no to the no no
Did not know Naked grandmas were this scary
Makes me kinda mad that people havent seen the originals idk why
Jaxon saying “Hello” with Pennywise gave me chills.
Pennywise doesn't have a family though... He's a cosmic monster. Thats not an exaggeration.
The old lady is it dauter

   




Idk how to spell :/ I have bad gramer
I am so pumped for chapter two!!!!
this proves why jaxon is my favorite teen on here :,)
im not watching that nope.

Are they all even old enough to watch this movie?
Jaxon at 3:38 😂
I WAS ACTUALLY EXCITED TO SEE IT NEW CHAPTER YASSSSSSS I’M SO HYPED THIS!!!!!
I was watching this on the toilet and I am now petrified.
11:18 you clearly don't understand Stephan King lol.
Considering pennywise in the book was a shapeshifter and could also take form of people and creatures
I tried watching it after work at 3 in the morning.  I stopped after I saw the old lady twitched.  I think I can watch it with the reactors so it doesn't feel like I'm watching it alone.
Chewbacca at 3:15
12:25 I'm soooo sorry but he looks so creepy
some of them not even watched IT the first chapter lol their reaction showed everything. They didn't get a lot of senses
watch my vid so you now what you can do so pewds wins
A lot of people never mentioned that most adults can't see Pennywise or any of his antics, like how Beverly's father didn't see the blood in the bathroom. But when Bev as an adult reads the postcard, she can see the blood on it.

She is pennywise
It, The shining, both had creepy grandmas, its almost like they were both from the same time period written by the same novelist or something!?
I  love clowns so I’m so ready for chapter two IT and plus I’m to young to see it but I don’t care I just wanna see clowns

God Bless
Too bad Tori and Tom are not here anymore in teens react
But it's ok they are in Adults react.
Not a single one of these kids have read the book.
I hate this, I hate scary movies and want nothing to do with em.. First scary movie I watched was "The Exorcist (1973 version)" I borrowed it from a friend in the 90's and watched it alone.
Sadly that wasn't the end of my scary movie watchlist.. Room 1408 still haunt me and I hate myself for watching that sick movie.
When pennywise says hello it sounds like Winnie the Pooh😂😂😂
The shining and IT are connected because stephen king likes connecting his horror movie in on big universe
It 2 will come out in my birthday week, who wants to go float with me??
I want to read the book but honestly I'm terrified to read it
He just called that dude thick
I assume it will be good i was debating on what will be better joker or it 2 personally i think joker will be better due to IT 2017 although it was an awesome movie it seemed to fail at being horror movie but hey personal opinion
This isn't even speculation. Just spoiling. Also, who didn't fucking guess the old lady was penny wise? Who needed an outside source to tell them? Fucking morons.

As much as I understand this is from source material YEARS ago (I've read the book) I like how no ones really complaining how much of this is potential spoilers. Yes there is no confirmation but with so many fairly spot on references to the source material I find it pretty close to that of one. 

Still excited to watch chapter 2.
Please react to "Someone you loved" by Lewis Capaldi
9:31 girl. The kids a brilliant actor too. Talk about making yourself vulnerable on screen, you ever seen book of Henry? Only movie that ever brought me to tears.
I love IT but I will have to say I will always love Tim Curry as pennywise more. I have to ask though have none of these teen ever seen the original IT before since none seem to know that part 2 is when they are adults
me over here watching this, crying bc I literally love IT so 
m  u c h-
When I watched this trailer I thought oh great now I’m gonna have to  Sage my house again like the last it movie lol
anyone else obsessing about how they said mike was the one who stabbed pennywise when it was clearly ben?
Pennywise is more of a female in ITs natural form. In the book IT lays a bunch of eggs.
I have an idea how about a Harry Potter spell challenge. It's simple, you show them a clip from the movie when a spell is about to happen but stop it before the spell is said by the character. The one who gets the most spell right win's. Or do a try not to eat challenge on the Harry Potter food.
Disappointed that no one pointed out the grandma’s “father” looked like pennywise
Stan lee directed the shining!
Everyone here talking about this film looking more faithful to the book, dear God I hope they have the courage to put the space turtle into It.

Why the f*ck didn’t Beverly get out of there when she had the chance...
Bev gagged when she drank the tea because it is sewer water I read book so that is how I know

HELL YES!!!!!!
OOF YES MA’AM
So , does Beverly like rough sex.?
Seeing the first movie really spoils some things, but it also makes the trailer really interesting.
I new all of these easter eggs like this was not bad in anyway but I could name one thing they got wrong with every clue
Naked grandma is SCARY ENOUGH😭
When Beverly looked at the tea, I thought Ms. Kersh is actually dead, and the tea is old, because she's dead and didn't do anything... Since she's dead.
I know I should be more excited for chapter 2 but chapter 1 is my go to
Spoilers: The book is always better than the movie.

2:48-2:55 IKR!!!
E
NEKKID GRANDMA!
The original movie started a whole fucking era of clowns
Honestly what’s scarier than a naked grandma?
I generally wouldn’t recommend reading it the book. I found it long winded and hard to read at times. Plus the part when Beverly has a orgy with the other boys when they were still young was ahh....unsettling. This is one instance where the movie is better than the book in my opinion.
When the old lady freezes, look at her eyes -  Pennywise's eyes.
The only thing that scares me are naked running old ladies

React to Marina new album Love + Fear
I saw this trailer but I thought it was just a another shitty horror movie but I didn’t know it was IT

i saw it when i was 9!!
I love how Jaxon goes from “hell ya” to “hell no”
Am I the only one who likes the oooo oooos? Just me ok 😂
Am I the only one who wasn’t remotely scared of the first It movie? Like I only jumped twice.
Generations React to the original "IT" miniseries trailer please do
The first one was so hilarious that I wasn't scared but this one actually looks like it's scary.

Do they not know that "Pennywise" is one of the many forms this eternal being is capable of disguising itself with? "It" is a shape shifting being, don't know why that pissed me off so much but it did, ya know? 😂
Everyone is like “WOAH IT’S THEM WHEN THEIR OLDER?!?!?” 

Me: Have none of you seen the original IT? Cuz it’s pretty obvious what they did here.
the transition from Bills voice to the ladys voice in the beginning is soooo seamless
Have none of these kid watched the original tv series? Like how. Do you research.

I'm really excited but I'm low key disappointed it's the kids grown up:/ I really liked the aesthetic of the pre-y2k kids having this spooky misadventure
I only watch scary movies at movie theaters so that way I'm not the only one pooping my pants
React to eurovision 2019,plisss!!!
Why is this video as dark as Episode 8x03 of Game of Thrones?
I have never seen it
So the kid in it chapter 1 had a broken arm and in Shazam his legs were broken why does he keep playing people with broken body parts I wonder how it is like that
Yesss,i can’t wait for the second part.
I thought Brayden was Krischelle's brother. Then I realized he's Josie's grandchild.
why is this 14 min?
You guys missed the beginning when the lady opened the door she sounded like Pennywise or at least I think so
He thrust his fist against the post and still insist he sees the ghost, amirite guys? Beep beep Ritchie, looking forward to this one.
It's professor x from X-Men
Dead body runing at her isnt the grandma its her dad obviously
"Maybe being pennywise passes down the family"? What is that kid talking about? He's a shapeshifting alien demon thing... he just made himself look like an old lady.
2:50 well they put naked grandmas because thats the scariest thing to see in the world
PHOBIA
Why this reaction has a more darker than other reactions? Why do they didn't even notice anything like they haven't seen the first chapter? Why all kids and teens? Why not generations? It would be fun actually if elder see this trailer, FBE come on !!
They clearly haven't seen the original movie or read the book
i seen the new it when i was 13 i had no idea it was rated r and still dont care im gonna it 2 september of 2019 right in the same theater that i saw it back then
Have teens play Mortal Kombat 11 please !
Sounds like Jaxon is finally allowed to say “hell”
Yeah that one lady is right a lot of movies dont usually go by the books but hopefully it chapter 2 does even though I've never read it.
If I were to make a book and have someone make a movie about my book and then you know what I would say. “TAKE THAT MOVIE OUT OF THOSES THEATERS!!!!” YOU PILE OF $#&*, WHAT THE HELL!!!  Yea
2:41 when you forget your towel in your room and you gotta run up in there all naked😭😂

Hi
Fbi open up!!!
These kids are idiots
If King is behind it, I'm behind it. Plus Hader is in it. So yesss

But the shining is one of the best movies ever. King may have been still in his coke days to not appreciate it
Not even gonna hold you when I first watched this trailer I thought my screen was frozen
These kids are idiots, I mean come on how can they not get that the old lady is IT.😒😒
its like the people that watched the first movie dont know that he changes into whatever he wants.
Suck my balls
WHY THE FUCK IS THE BACKGROUND DARKER???????????¿¿¿ JESUS
If y’all are quick about this I expect y’all to react to I don’t care by Justin Bieber tomorrow
THANK YOU JAXON! I was waiting to entire time for someone to say a line. I can't flipping wait!
Glad they didn't keep to close to the book in the first movie. No need for a teen orgy at the end
This is the first time I've ever thought the teens were stupid lol. Obviously, it's Pennywise. He can take form of anything, or was that not clear in the last movie? I hope they go off the book because it's more powerful then that. It alters reality, that building was boarded up and no one has lived there in years. The old women, the lived in room, its all just things It wants you to see.
realizes that some of them didnt read the book and have no idea what is actually happening
1:28 he got fish swimming in his hair
React to the new joker movie pleeeeeeeeez 🙏🙏🙏🙏

Yes it's supposed to be when their older but me and my brother haven't read the book he says it's too long it's doesn't look that long to me but then it's them as kids and then them as adults and he also told me the kid from Shazam that was in it is going to die because he does in the book even though he hasn't read it but he probably heard it before.
React to the Joker trailer! How have you not?!
You should do a try not to blink video.
1:44 noooooooo really, wow, I would of never known

I dont know why people think IT is scary
Hi
Steve Harvey - “Name something that a burglar does not want to see when breaking into a house”
Rod - “NAKED GRANDMA!!!”
it's funny because you can tell some of them don't TRULY understand Pennywise and the entity of him. he isn't just a clown, he shape shifts into many other things. Pennywise is just his favorite form
What if Stephen Kings will make a sequel for The Shining
2:48 😂😂🤣🤣
it's pretty obvious that the old lady is pennywise though??
I never knew what pennywise is... like who is he? How’s he here? His purpose? His powers? Why couldn’t he go on the Mad Titans planet?
Is the video in a vignette. 🤔🤔
I can’t wait to see this movie I’ve been dying to watch it
did some of them not watch the original movie? 💀
Hell yea, it didn't look that scary but I gotta watch the movie anyway.
The old lady where she has that burned part its from when they shot pennywise with a gun
It's back
90% of people remember this

Richie: ROCK WAR
  *gets hit by a rock*

okay am i the only one thinking how CUTE jaxon is, especially from him saying “helloooo” 😂
2:48 they have the same writer soooo
Funny how our society works. Kids in the movie can curse but teens can't see the movie because of the profanity.
I dont know why im not scared
I look 3:28 two kids what are close on her???
"No one who dies here ever really dies." they don't die, they just float
Omg Jaxon when he did the hello was SPOT ON OMG !!! 😂😂
More try not to eat
They haven't read the book and I'm kinda sad. I understood all the easter eggs before they had to explain it to them.
Can you do a try not to eat with like classic dishes from places in he USA or around the world?

3:37 "Helloo" I laughed so hard
O u afraid

I’d pick my own opinion cuz I couldn’t care less about what critics or people think this is my opinion if I like the movie I like the movie regardless if others agree or not
FUCK YEAH THIS GOT ME HYPED
Of course jaxon would know about this he’s friends with Jack Dylan grazer and I love it

It is coming for revenge
Things i notice:
Grannys eyes are some kinda moving independently while talking to Bev
Grannys voice when she opens the door was the actual voice of Bill(actor of pennywise)
Granny is actually potraying the witch in hunsle and gretel(bev is also scared of the witch when she was a child)by the cookies
The staring granny at the backgound was kinda similar to the first film when the cubby boy was in the library and the librarian is staring at him smiling and unfocused
the “hello” at 3:37 got me😂

Teens react to Trendy plzzzz (WNO for the ogs)
FINALLY
I’m soooooo ready for this movie my sis is gonna watch it
Who else knew what was going to happen because of the original It?
Stephen King directed one of his own movies & well it doesn't get a good wrap, even in King's own opinion (he was apparently a bit high at the time)  personaly I quite like it, Maximum Overdrive being the movie, but if he can't direct one of his own stories, then what on earth is anyone listening to his opinion of other director's takes on his stories for. Also, as for King not liking Kubrick's The Shining, if you watch the tv movie of The Shining, which is more in line with his book it's a confusing yawn fest & a waste of time, Unlike Kubrick's Movie.
women stares at you 
checks to see if video is paused
Yay
I’m so ready for this movie
Why didn’t y’all react to the Joker trailer 😳

Survival kit for watching spooky things
-Volume down
-Have something to drink
-Avoid eye contact with the trailer at almost all costs
-Have the window minimized

Hope this helped! :D
I think I know why scary movies have naked grandmas, it's because of family feud
I cannot wait to see this movie I'm so exited!!!🤓🤓
“I can’t watch R rated movies” are parents that strict like fucking hell 😂 “ohhhhh so does pennywise pass down through generations” what ?! 😂😂
They said some of you are teens and can't even see the movie I'm 11 I watched chucky Jason Halloween 🎃  Freddy Krueger IT IT 2017 AND I'M SEEING THis one
A lot of this happened in the original version of the movie.
Did anyone here see this just to see people react to the naked grandma?
I don't think it's such a good idea to stay faithful to the book knowing that there is a child orgy part
Bill Skarsgard (it) is so hot omggggg
The first one has me laughing all along, I had one pop up that scared me alone and everyone laughed at me in the theater. Scary stuff makes me laugh most the time tho. 🤷‍♀️

Why do people constantly forget that pennywise is a shapeshifter? He’s not even a real physical being except for the dead lights. But so many people are like “woah, is the grandma his daughter? Does the pennywise thing pass down with generations.” No. He’s back after all these years. You know. Like they said in the first film. And the mini series. And the book.
Pls react to maleficent mistress of evil "tailer"
Fun fact: The old lady is looking at Beverly with her right eye, but she's also looking at YOU with her left eye at the same time. More proof that she is in fact Pennywise.
Why are we they theorizing that the old lady is Pennywise. His main ability is to shape-shift.
Omg them saying you must be 18 to see yet I saw it when I was 15 pfft rated R
If you have seen the original mini series, you know what will happen.  I love Tim Curry a lot better!
Ima get tickets
“Maybe being Pennywise passes down in the family” ummmm what
I thought half of like all this was obvious and I saw both the first movies so th fact no one knows anything bugs me
Wait, if they are going to follow the book then that means Stan and Eddie might die.
has already read most of the book and knows all of the trailer and what it means
I watched this instead of watching the actually trailer because I was to scared lol
It's 2017 it takes place in
I am the glabglobgabgalab
I I IT!
7:39 wasn’t that a little obvious?
"Its all of them in the future!" Well yeah hahaha
It’s like the original. Yes!
Fuck horror.  I hate this genre 🤣
The book was so so scary! Especially the part (in the book)  with Bev and the grandma. 😖
Anyone else notice the spotlight effect on their faces???
Im not early
IM SO EXCITED WTF
I watched the first it movie and I loved billverly

Who wishes pennywise was real at the same time?

It bothers me that nobody even knows anything about what Pennywise is....Pennywise is a celestial being who literally takes on the form of your worst fears. He can be or do whatever he wants.
“oh no no.”
“OH YEAHHH BABY!”
11:09-11:30😰 I don't think she realized the point of the movie and that Georgie was never going to get saved because he is DEAD and that at the end Georgie is actually Pennywise in disguise.
I'm not Reddie omg

14:10 this dude looks and sounds like Tyler the Creator

I- the fact they have never seen. The original with Tim curry upsets me like YES THEY ARE OLDER!
1. Why doesn't it come out on Halloween or a Friday The 13th?
2. I haven't even watched IT but this trailer makes me want to watch it now
3. Hol' up lemme tell my friend that really likes IT about this
It: what's your greatest fear?
Me: a running naked gramma
Smh they don’t know anything about the story. Like how the second half is the kids as adults OR how pennywise is a shapeshifter.

7:42 GURL WUT?!?? 😂🔫🤦🏽‍♀️
Am I the only one who think that the old lady is pennywise’s daughter and that penny wise was a person before he became a demon? Idk that’s I think I might be hella stupid for saying this but whatever
The first one was funny this one based on the trailer seems like it’s going to be funnier
“hellooo” 🤣🤣🤣
10:46 I thought this was teens react
I cant wait for this movie even tho im 11
I’m somewhat disappointed that they were shocked they are older like they didn’t even know what the story is legit about.
Edit:pennywise comes back every 27 years oops
3:37 HAHAHA I CAN'T THIS IS HALARIOUS. I WAS SCARED UNTILL THIS MANZ CAMME AND SAID hello
I still dont understand how people find IT a scary movie
I bet someone is gonna be like

Lets hope they will NOT and I repeat NOT include the final scene from the book.

You know what I'm talking about.

Yayy part 1 was great
Can u react to yakusoku no neverland
The cool part is that the young actors chose who they want to play the adults version
Stanley Kubrick is the greatest film director ever, so there is no debate.
Dude I love It, when I watched the first one I was 12, and I didn't think it was scary, I have been waiting for the trailers for it part 2 to come out and I can't wait for the whole movie to come out
“i like how faithful they are to the book” are u sure about that? u wanna know how they initially made the pact to come back to Dary in the book? 😂😂
6:41 : what did the narrator say? i only heard "... something's up with her teen this scene" ??? someone please answer
I wanna see it so bad
7:50 pennywise is a shapeshifter, therefore she’s probably pennywise
Wanna se it oof
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP AS SOON AS I SAW THAT CREEPY A** GRANDMA FROM THE VISIT!!!!
naked grandmothers.
I read the book and could not sleep for an entire week. It was super terrifying. I loved the movie in itself but the movie didn't effect me as much as the actual book did. I am super excited for this movie, I've been a huge fan of Stephen King for a long time and I really love his books.
I saw it when I was 12 I thought it was pg13
King is known for proclaiming that MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE is a scary movie..... yeah, no it is not.
Do a reaction with adults and it chap 2
How are you random person in the comments
Dylan’s already 17?!? WTF
I hope this one is scarier than the last one which I did see in theaters.

did non of them read the book lol ?
I think jason found out he can say hell he was saying it alot
Not many of them actually watched the first part of IT
I watched it like 3 times
For me it isn’t scary
This isnt a good idea to watch at night
Bruh, the book is thicc, i mean T H I C C
I saw a naked grandma at the store it was nasty😂😔
these comments are so recent wth
Is it just me or literally almost all the teen teachers laugh or at least try to and then you can tell nobody though it was something g funny because it stops immediately (THE EDITED PART)»»»» for example 6:54 ok never mind I had to edit this again it’s actually at 6:52
le’raun is fine😍
This movie is not a thriller, it’s a comedy.... Steven King failed.
Also if you look the blood is on the postcard with the poem 
The blood is from the bathroom scene
2:34 look at Georgie in background
The naked grandma is me running to my room to go get my towel naked
"Breaking gender roles" Pennywise is genderless, he's a freakin Alien, better yet he's a giant spider. He just takes the form of a clown.
Penny wise is not the old woman’s father. The old woman IS penny wise.
On my birthday, great
Please pin this if you really read these
at 2:33 you can see her look over at her while she looks at the pictures it's creepy
“What with horror movies and naked grandmas” 😂😂
2:49 I don’t know, blame Stephen King. Also guys I suggest you read the IT book it’s more like horror (the first movie was more of a comedy to me).
PLEASE REACT TO IMAGINE DRAGONS
Well, didn't watch the remake, but I liked the originals. So now that chapter 2 is being adapted too I might watched both. And if Stephen likes it, It's a good sign :D
“It” franchise is overrated
For score and 27 years ago.
I might seem slow but isn’t Pennywise only seen by kids? If so how are they seeing him while their adults?
7:46 what does she mean
I thought I wouldn't like the re-make cause you know usually they aren't good but the re-make was rlly good!
All the og kids from kids react are so grown up oml
All I know is that in the novel there is something wrong with her tea so can anyone that as read the book it can you tell me what’s wrong

The girl that was sad and waited for Georgie to come back clearly missed the point of the whole fucking film

In the end when it says hello I think it sounds like Pooh from whiny the Pooh
3:17 is that projared
anybody knows that IT 2 is 27 years after the first movie (before you saw this video)
I liked the scene where at the Chinese restaurant and the fortune cookies come alive
At the end of the of the trailer when pennywise comes out and says "helluuu" the sound effect scares the sheizer out of me.
9:27 - "That's the guy from SPLIT."


Nah, he's the guy from WANTED.
4:44
Aren't they not old enough to go to the movie?

Did no one read the book or see the original?
When your talking about penny wise don’t say “oh she’s probably it” just fucking say penny wise
Do stranger things 3!!!
I loved the first one just wasn't as scary as I thought it could be yeah I loved the jump scares but I found the movie mostly funny and suspenseful so I really hope the second they really focus more and the scarrrrrrier side

There are rumours that the old lady is the daughter of Pennywise🤷‍♂️

@ 0:25 you can hear that it was actually pennywise that answered the door.
'Maybe being Pennywise is passed down through the family' yall what, thats just Pennywise
Sadly I got resistent against horror movies/ scares because I watched too many of them in my lifetime... Guess this masterpiece is going to be an average one😢
Have they not seen the 1990’s one🤔🤔🤔🤔

Dang, some of them cant see a R rated movie, but i whatched IT 13 when i was 10 without any adult supervision. I memorised every single line of the movie
Is it me or the first one was much scarier and this second is less scarier
I thought my brightness was down 😂😂😂
Why is it IT chapter 2 even tho there was 3 already
I love how u guys list the Easter eggs gonna see this movie for sure love U guys💗
Nigahiga GTFO Get the F*ck out
I dont blame them for not reading the book. I tried but it was too dang wordy. Managed to read it all while skimming. Kinda regret it now.
Gaaahhhh you couldn't get one reactor who's read the book or at least seen the original mini series? I'm so sad at how these badass Easter eggs aren't making people more hype. The lumberjack statue is such a big detail!
Producers : How many ballons do you want
Pennywise : Yes
I wonder how many fingers it takes to fill pennywises forehead

Blaaahhhh all of their bad guesses make me sad. Yes Pennywise is Mrs. Kersh, but not because "it gets passed down" its cause he can take any form he wants. And the backstory of him joining the circus isn't from the book so idk where that's gonna go.
Can’t wait for IT chapter 2 AAAHHHH. Fan boy of IT
I watched quite a bit of the filming for this movie and it looks great! can't wait to see my small town on the big screen! :)
Also Ben is the one who stabs pennywise not mike. Cause then the mummy face thing attacks Ben and mike saves him. Sorry. Just had to comment that

But remember that because critics have a job to review movies that they can be easily paid to give a bad movie a good review.
That is why I only look at audience reviews scores on Rotten Tomatoes and other reviews sites that allow audience scores.

This looks sooo scary but i'm so excited seeing them as adults and how/what are they gonna do in order to stop "it" again.
pennywise is even scarier now because he felt fear for the first time. he wants to get revenge even more than he did before.
This was the only way I could watch the it trailer without covering the screen with my hand

Do these stupid ass kids not understand penny wise is a shapeshifter
would’ve been better if they saw the first ‘It’ and then reacted to this 😔
First: Pennywise is just the clown, the entity is known as It.
Second: the old lady is It. In the book It takes the form of the old lady.
It looks like almost everyone in this video don't know that Pennywise is a shape shifter. Every monster we've seen on the first filme was It. Pennywise is just another form, one that easily attracts kids. So yeah, the old lady is most likely It.
Did these kids seen the oroginal movie??
NEKKID GRANMA! 




Anyone get the reference? :(
Pennywise is a shape shifter or whatever right?
I'm disappointed with these teens because it is quite clear that they haven't seen the original IT movie. I'm younger than most of them and even I grew up watching and knowing that IT was a classic horror.

They are both Stephen King novels. IT Chapter 2 is probably doing it for a reason.
I feel like they should have brought back to kids but older like either they are 15 16 you know because I feel like adults do to much in movies especially if you saw them in the same film as kids
The trailer is garbage
/in the original, the teacup contained blood??? Right?
They all sound so confused that they’re older... they clearly haven’t seen the old one
WOW WOW
Kids react to deadmeat
What's the name of the little boy who gets pulled down into the storm drain by IT  again?
Can't remember
after reading the book i don't think anything in the movie could gross me out or scare me...the book is some next level horror shit
This channel is a joke.
i thought the womans skin was decaying, hence the 'mark' seeing as i presume hes occupying the dead woman who used to live there?

Most of the teens: Oh this is them in the future???? shocked about Easter eggs

Teen: There was a lot of bad words specially by kids and I didn't expect that
Me: Be honest the younger the kids the more bad words they say (nowadays and new generations)
I liked the first remake, but I'd rather them turn another book into a movie that hasn't been done, yet. I've been waiting to see Insomnia for about 20 years.
Apparently naked grandmas are the new trend.....

When she says when someone dies in dairy no one really dies which means that pennywise didn’t die
Im a boy and a dad
Oo
Me after vid:OH HELL NAH
How can I be on teens react? 👀
The picture of the old lady's father looks a lot alike Jack Torrence from the Shining
The old naked lady is a reference to the old naked lady in room 237 from The Shining
OH MY JAXON JACK HEART, i thought jaxon wanna say something about jack. but hm nah, maybe later 🙃
Teens that have been apart of the video, I challenge you to read the book. I am 16 years old and I have read the book more than once. I also went to a Catholic school and we have a few bibles in every classroom and when I had a bible and compared the sizes of both books. Read it. It is thicker than the Bible. 

Have fun!
So excited! 😀
Pennywise sounds like Pooh bear when he says hello
Can they react to new GOT song "Power is Power" by The Weeknd, SZA and Travis Scott
Nobody knows professor X
All of y'all have been making these comments 10 seconds ago
Is it me or did Jaxons voice change??
I hope the sequel will be at least slightly scary, unlike the last one.
The old woman is penny wise and Bev is actually drinking shit or blood or something and the house is actually trashed bc no one has taken care of it !! (:
Yeetus the fetus
You know even their bite is kind of traumatized I mean Eddy's Bike is probably dead because in chapter one he left it behind so it probably captured Eddy's Bike and is torturing it somewhere
Yoll float to

Name something that burglars don't wanna see when they robbed the house





NAKED GRANDMA!
It 2 
Ah S*** here we go again
Also we're in the endgame now
Any noticed the sad face in the background in the window at 1:10  it’s there the hole time even when the lady talks about no one dies.
I do think (5:52) that the flies symbolize something that I can't tell for those who haven't read the book
I don’t think she’s penny wise because he’s in that picture when she’s talking about her dad
becca: it’s time to gtfo !!
me: nigahiga- how to survive a horror movie :D
College plays TABS totally accurate battle simulator
“She probably IT not gonna lie”

The trailer came out last night I believe 🤪🤪 I’m already going crazy
Who would have thought a naked grandma would be I.T
I saw it as a kid back in the day. I no longer like watching horror so I haven't seen the new one
Omg finally!!!!! I’ve been waiting for y’all to react to this 😁💖💖💖💖💖
I’m so opposite, I didn’t find the first one scary so I’m not too concerned so I’m hoping to watch this one with someone so I can see them react
My teachers say I’m a psycho because I love and find the bloodiest gruesome movies awesome and fun...
Jason is the only reason I still watch this channel
Omg I cant waiit
College kids react to Flatbush zombies please
Hi
I've ask my mom if we could watch this when it comes out
Jordan is STUNNING 😍
So they haven't seen the original obviously, because they're shocked that they're adults. Yes the Shining is terrible.
The teens react fact: dont have all the facts they are missing the fact that is an adaptation from the novel and a reboot to the IT 1 1990, and 2
I sAw sOme EyE BalLs

When the old lady stares in the void one eye is looking at Beverly and the other in the camera ...
Whats more scarier than PennyWise?
Naked Grandma!!
this is one literally crawled my skin. I had chills from the voice alone then that deadpan stare. this trailer scarier than the whole of the first movie.
Show IT to adults as well! :)
I have read the book and seen the original movie.
Alexander Skarsgard is creepy as It but for me not as much Tim Curry. Like does nobody know how to look things up or read like on a tablet or something? 
Nobody knew anything about the story and I don't understand why..
I'm not going to watch the movie "It" because I hate scary movies.
Am I the only one who's gonna talk about how hype I am for the movie?!??
Omg that dig about Ben who loses weight. Wtf dude have anything else to talk about?
The opening scene from the new trailer was scarier than anything from the first movie.
Chapter 1 was funny 😂
He said “iM oUt” 14:42 😂
There was also a part with a bridge and lots of balloons in the trailer and I got excited because I started remembering it from the book.
I’m in the beginning the first thing the old lady says when she opens the door sounds like pennywise’s voice.
you can tell half of these kids never read the book😂
How did she think the first one was scary
First one wasn’t scary now this one is “ 0_0 “
First one wasn’t scary now this one is “ 0_0 “
WHATS WITH HORROR MOVIES AND NAKED GRANDMAS HAHA
Pennywise is a shapeshifter
You know these people never read this book at all oh my God 😄
Damn I have watch it right away Stephen king approved makes me so happy
It is a really scary movie, if you're a knight who says Ni.
the film was almost going to be released on my birthday
Spanish please
In chapter 1 pennywise got stabbed on he’s Cheesed
Godzilla king of the monsters next??? Trailer 1 and 3 are amazing. Emotional music over monsters killing each other
Dude, if Stephen King likes it then you know it's gotta be good
10:44 The novel isn't broken into two chapters, though it does take place in two time periods. It's broken up into 23 chapters, 5 parts, and 5 interludes. The parts alternate between time periods.
13:47
4:44
Some of them haven't seen the original and it SHOWS
4:44 for easter eggs
Not to sound smart and all, but the original kid actors of IT chapter one, got the ability to choose who they want to play as their adult roles and those are the actors they chose.
10 secs ago
I’m 11 and I saw IT when I was 10 and IT is my fav movie by far. I watched it because Finn Wolfhard is my favourite person ever and I do enjoy stranger things so the movie was great. I recommend it so much
naked grandma 👵🏻
                             👙
9:47 have these people never seen the original movie
Their was already a IT movie before this one and the sequel...everytime they say I've saw the first one they dont specified which one...IT chapter 1 and 2 are reboots so which first one ur talking about.
comes out on my birthday🤩
I saw it one when i was 9
3:37 i like that sound
"Thats the guy from split" headass. No hes Professor X
Hold me gorgie will ya
React to Hollywood undead
These guys never saw the original or else they would know the transition
Anyone else watch part 2 of the original IT? My missus is an avid horror fan and for like 15 years she had no idea there was a second part
Could you get college kids to react to stranger things 3 trailer
is this what ppl feel of It???
1:01 if i were on the react channel i would be hysterically laughing at that point
Isn’t obvious it is penny wise
The original IT movie gave my mother a horrible fear of clowns






Guess im ready to make the same mistakes as her
“hello”
I feel the need to inform people that pennywise as a creature is in fact female being pregnant in the book but dies before she can give birth
Its creepy
The “oh hell no” that got me
NEKED GRANDMA
Time to float
I was not a fan of the first movie at all. It wasn't even a scary movie. I loved the book IT and it was probably one of the better books I've read. Stephen King's books are freaking phenomenal but I do not really have high hopes for the second movie.
How is being pennywise being a family thing. He’s a shapeshifter, that’s how he is a old lady
None of them sound like they’ve seen the original.  It’s incredibly frustrating.
Naked grandmas are the new horror movie meta now?
first one was okay
You don’t know how many times I’ve watched this trailer
7:42 RIGHT AS SHE DAID "That's interesting" I THOUGHT OF THE DRAKE AND JOSH MEME WHERE SHE'S LOOKING AT A COMPUTER,SMILING AND IT'S CAPTIONED "interesting." THEY EVEN KINDA LOOKS ALIKE IM WHEEZING
So your telling me that your reacting to it chapter 2 but you haven’t seen the first one ?!?!?!?
More Pennywise memes. Great.
These kids are 2000s babies so they don’t know the story behind  the movie and the book. 

But 90s babies we know it way more 🤣
HELL YEAH* next scene* HELL NO

Wow I can't believe someone actually haven't watched the first one. 
SOMEONE NEED MOVIECATION!!
some of y’all have not seen the original and i can tell
oop-
you guys should watch the original IT from 1990 with Tim Curry as Pennywise that movie made 80s and 90s kids terrified of clowns
"That's the guy from Split" or as he's best known for, younger Professor Charles Xavier.
I wonder how many of them have seen or will watch the Tim Curry miniseries.
06:57 that’s not how drums work what your showing wouldn’t sound like that except for the crash cymbal

Wow i realize the age gap when i see teenagers these days and how they think .. its like really? She didn’t like to watch the movie in theaters bc she can’t pause it💀
Plot twist! Beverly does a quick up yours move.      THE END
I’ve read the book and it’s always so funny to me to watch people analyzing the trailer like what does this mean. Obviously it won’t be 100% to the book but if you know the book it gives you a head start to understanding the trailer.
I'm gonna see the second so yas

OMG! Clueless!!! All clueless. "OMG, is that Beverly?"
"Are they all way older?"
"Maybe being Pennywise runs through the family or something."

Read the goddamn book! Yes, it's them older.
Pennywise is an entity that can change it's form to whatever it wants, literally anything. It can be a clown, a rotting corpse or in this case an old lady.
It's not a "runs in the family" thing, there's only one of IT, Pennywise is the old woman and vice versa.
This was frustrating to watch
invite the it cast to surprise jaxon in a video because he is so excited to see this movie lol
"What's with horror movies and naked grandmas?
"Maybe being Pennywise passes down through the family or something"... The fuck?
There should be no speculation, there is a book. Why do they act like there is no chapter2
Have none of them ever seen the first one
Dang why are they so surprised
LOVE MARLHY
If anyone has seen the original movie... Then the grandma is indeed pennywise
Why do they act like they didn’t know that they would be adults in the original they were adults

Trailer speculation?!?!?!......you people do know there’s whole book and a movie that will be pretty close to this movie 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
It was pretty obvious that the old lady was pennywise.  Also the fact that King likes it himself that’s saying something..

I can’t imagine being denied watching a rated R movie especially once your 13+ years... especially since I have watched rated R since I was a child with my siblings. Guess I grew up in a different time where things weren’t so “safe” for kids
OMG IN SO EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE!!!! AHHHH!!!!
Pennywise: I’m scary af
Old lady: hold my teeth
The visit had a naked grandma lmao
I saw this and said "GET THE BLEP OUT OF HERE"
If you read the book, none of this is speculation or an easter egg lol
If you see it one time, you saw it in A theater, not "in theaters"!
We all know she is pennywise have yall not read the book or seen the original 2 part film with tim curry
I loved the first one , it was amazing! Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait a few months for ‘It’ to come out on dvd 😒
hmm.. hearing them say that the first one was scary implies that they haven't watched a single good horror movie yet :D
That song at the end of the trailer gives me chills 😶

The flies were an easter egg bc if you read the book you know they are only 6 in the loser club rn
hi
Have adults react to this, so they can point out the differnce between the original film and this one.
What about the flies in the window. They represent the six kids coming back to the town.
Pennywise is a shape shifter.
People need to start understanding that the old lady IS Pennywise
I'm surprised these guys know so little about this book/ movie
I was 10 when I saw it
Oh wow
My mom was in the living room when I was watching the IT: Chapter Two trailer, and when she saw the old lady walk around naked behind Bev, she yelled out gross old lady. XD

Small spoilers ahead based on the book. When she arrives, the name on the bell out front is momentarily seen as Marsh before switching to Kersh (which sounds a bit like another word; think about it). Further, the father doesn't die...or at least, Bev isn't around when he does, and oh my god, of COURSE Kersh is Pennywise. The rest of the scene confirms that. On a personal note, props to the producers for having Kersh say father as faddah, which  is how it's said in the book.

Also, did Marlhy actually say that chapter 2 takes place in the future? She does realize that chapter one took place in 1989, right? Okay, maybe she doesn't, but really... come on.
Omg react to the stranger things 3 trailer already!!
"What's up with scary movies and naked grandmas !?"

The ignorance is astounding in this video. Pennywise is not the name of the character. It's just It. He's a shapeshifter. Of course hes the old lady. He was the old lady in the original TV special too. Man. No research goes into the topics chosen

I still love the Original Stephen King's: IT (1990) TV Miniseries, but still would like to see Part II of the remake. I hope they have a few of the original TV Miniseries cast appeared here. Still would love to see a continuation of the original Miniseries set 29 years later with It aka Pennywise returning tormenting a new Generation. since Pennywise/ it  can take whatever form Bill Skarsgård can still play Pennywise, Tim Curry would be proud.
Can you please do a reaction to the stranger things 3 trailer

Hello im a fan and i hope theres acully a new one😊 and sub to me
Yes kids, if you watch the original with Tim Curry (not the basketball guy) in 1990 showed them as they were older.  R.I.P to those actors we have lost like John Ridder & Harry Anderson and others.
Best of luck reading IT...😂😂😂

Hi guys I am a big fan I really like your YouTube videos

those “easter eggs” aren’t news lmao. if you’ve read the book and/or watched the miniseries you’d know a lot of this. it’s not like they’d change those little details considering how classic IT is
Ooh, spookay.
I would like to watch adults react to azerrz
AHHHHH IM EXCITED💜💜💜
They should have compared this sequel coming out to the sequel from the 90s version.
Yes!!!!
Cant wait for the Netflix adaptation 😂😂
1 like if you're going to watch it chapter 2 comment if you're not going to watch it chapter 2
Reactor: "I'm surprised they looked that much at the details."
Me: I'm not. It's the INTERNET. SOMEBODY, SOMEWHERE will notice EVERY detail.
Everyone: Randomly stops the trailer to figure out hints at plot.


Me: Picks up the book....
love you guys
I love Jaxon he's just like me I love horror movies😊❤
Ok do you think that this is the final part of the film or will it broken into a third part?
They missed a few Easter eggs. There is a picture of two girls which people are saying that they are the twin girls in the shining ( at 2:20) also right after that they scan up to another picture of a guy that looks like Jack nickolson who plays  Jack in the shining (at 2:38)
You guys wanna hear a joke

IM 11 AND IM ALLOWED TO WATCH RATED R MOVIES!!!! THESE PEOPLES PARENTS ARE CRAZY!!! well as long as my parents approve it...sometimes they say no depending if they seen it and its not that bad...so my parents aren't that bad lol
Here’s what you need to do: read the book first
The first one followed the 1rst it movie in the 90s (I think) \ book  so the new movie will probably follow the tv show I think it was 


And we all knew that the old lady was penny wise
Jordan's really beautiful
The old lady is creepy AF
I can't believe that a great part of the people who have reacted to the trailer on YT just don't realize that the old lady in the trailer is Pennywise, and not just some random crazy lady. I thought it was obvious, idk.
REACT TO THE JOKER TRAILER
ACKKK
I can’t wait to see this movie!
Oof
This is the first I've seen of the second section of the movie. I had a feeling there would be a second movie just because in the first made for TV mini series or movie, whichever it was, the original IT, which I still say no one can replace Tim Curry as Pennywise, it was technically two parts where they all came back to face their childhood fears and IT.. I can't wait to see this one. I've always hated clowns, they scare the crap outta me...and even though the original IT film didn't scare me with the clown idea, it was the storytelling by Stephen King that made it creepy. Now it's all CGI etc. where half the kids watching these movies now (no I'm not old, but old enough to know the difference) never saw the original, read the book, etc. and only critique the new remakes like they're the originals..which they aren't. Most of them far from it because the original was more suspense as this one was more jump scares/gore, as today's horror is. Suspense in my opinion is worse than gore. Just like every remake, the original happened in another language, which should also be watched, take The Grudge for example, before they made the Americanized version, including sequels. I thought the Japanese (I believe it was) version was wayyy scarier than the remake in the US.
Too many spoilers man at least warn
I am so excited, heeeeeeee
Thanks for showing me the IT bro

Well the woman is penny wise, because penny wise can transform and the old woman says no one really dies, but at the end of it chapter 1 the kids thought penny wise died
Great reaction!!! I’ve been waiting for It: Chapter 2 for a very very long time! So exciting 💫
The first IT I thought was really great overall scary not so much but this looks to be so much better and hopefully scary
10:54 who the fuck ever said they were little kids. damn. If you want little kids, read the book. They are like 13 in the movie and are in 3rd grade in the book. The bullies are like 17 in the movie and in 5th grade in the book.

3:38 LOL  THAT WAS PERRRFEEECCCTTTT XD
It would've been cool to have the perspective of a teen who had read the book. I, for one, am so excited about it. It looks so faithful to the book and I am excited to see some familiar faces to me (such as Isaiah Mustafa). Also, because I cannot hear about The Shining without putting my two cents on it, The Shining may be a great film, but it is a terrible adaptation. I agree with Stephen King regarding how it really lacks character depth and it is just a crazy dad who went even crazier in a hotel rather than be influenced by the hotel itself like he was on the book. I wonder if, when the trailer for Doctor Sleep comes out, if the teens might react to it because the director is adapting the novel but he also has to keep in mind the adaptation, which might make for a strange hybrid of bad and good adaptation, who knows.
Is it just me or was the background darker than usual?
They react to this but not season 3 stranger thing trailer (no hate to it I love it
"then at the end he died and I was like what was the point of that" um... georgie died at the beginning, that was a manifestation of pennywise. did the girl pay attention to the movie at all?

Hiya georgy
old IT is soooo much better but sure, this one is also alright? I would say. But guessing from their reaction I can tell they didn't watch it :( at least read the book please.
I really wish that instead of saying "this statue" they'd say that its paul Bunyan. He's a folktale from Maine and his statue sits in Bangor ME, the city that Stephen King bases many of his stories in, including IT
Teens react Arctic Monkeys
Naked Grandmas are soooooo 2014.
HYPED
Can’t wait!  BUT:

1). I am not certain some of the kids should read the book.  The movie handled some of the book’s awful children’s scenes well ( or not at all).
2). Everyone should see the TV movie for the wonderful performances in a terrifying campy movie!  Tim Curry is excellent!  I think John Ritter does a great job portraying a grown up that is carrying multiple traumas from childhood.  Tim Reid is very good at being the “gatekeeper “ and gives an underrated performance as such.

JMO.
Awww so happy to see someone continue onto adults react. I love seeing someone's last video in one group going to the next.
Also the old woman isn’t actually his daughter. The old woman is pennywise. He has no daughter and he doesn’t have a family.

By the way the trailer is scarry as shit!!!
Mrs. Kersh was seriously the scariest scene for me in part 2 of the tv series. It gave me nightmares when she changes into... [hehehe] and in that series, her tea was blood instead of sewage. This teaser trailer just brought back the same feeling of dread for me. I think the scar on both Beverly and Mrs. Kersh are accurate but the flies are either because of the sewage or... someone is a corpse. Will I go see it? Oh yeah. "We all float down here.  In the dead lights!" The naked grandma part reminded me of In the Mouth of Madness. I LOVE THAT MOVIE!

It is so scary
The old woman felt a bit sus at the start because in the first it film Pennywise discised himself as an old lady
I’m so happy they didn’t get overly attractive actors to play the group. It would have completely detached things for me because the book makes it very obvious that they’re very average people, apart from Bev and Ben who are known for being slightly more attractive
Yessss!!! Thank you!!
And I love that you guys even make the studio atmosphere look so dark haha

Finally commenting on a video
Show the kids pet semetary jump scares
“OMG that’s all of them in the future!”
Me-.......*smh* took you this long? You didn’t figure it out with Beverly?....

Also the naked grandma is supposed to be her fear of her elders(dad) abusing her when she was younger. Hence pennywise feeding off her fear.

And the obvious is these teens never read the book which if you have you already knew what happened in each of these paused scenes in this video.

My favorite songs and videos of theirs are the ones they released in 2010. "Nee", "Voice", and "Natural ni Koishite". They have other cool ones but those I liked the most.

It seems like  Amuse promotes Perfume so much more than ONE OK ROCK, though I feel OOR  might have more mainstream appeal.

i can listen to them talking all day without understanding a word  and i will still be happy there voice are so awesome
I hope they do a whole video of just Perfume.

Omg they are cute.
Do you guys Have kana boon madkid and Others banda pls

jpop is nice.
I want to recommend a following video to you who are interested in J-pop trio Perfume. This is Perfume’s performance in 2017.
https://youtu.be/lgdASCXJjNk

This is a joint performance with Japanese telecom company NTT docomo to demonstrate the effectiveness of superspeed 5G network. They performed a song “Fusion” at the same time in different countries, a-chan (middle position on FBE video) in Tokyo, KASHIYUKA (right) in London, and NOCCHi (left) in NY. That was livestreamed on split screens. 

They always show us the way to challenge for new best performance. I am proud of them. I am proud to be their big fan. I am happy if you start to like Perfume. Thank you.
I see Perfume, i click 😁

And yes. Laser Beam is my first song that knocked my heart to stan Perfume.
React to "Mundo" please...
No one ever thought thru the whole video that they sound like anime characters 😂
Wow... I only know sakura gakuin and vocaloid... Hehehehe....
The girl in the middle looks and sounds like she came straight out of an anime lol
Jpop is really amazing and more than the “react to jpop” video shown. Many artists are really talented, like Sheena ringo, Yonezu Kenshi and Utada Hikaru. I really wish everyone can give a chance to listen to Japanese music!!!!
It's so funny that Perfume saw the vedio! LOVE them soooo much.
Ugh. These girls are so nice and cute >0<💜💜💜❤❤❤😊 
I really like how they present themselves. Calm, gentle and sweet.
3d waifu
Its like i was watched anime.
2010年くらいにユーチューブでPerfumeのVOICEのPVを偶然見つけて、その時に日本語が全然わからなくて、「なにこの外国語、意味わかったらいいなぁ」と思って、グーグルしました。それで、日本語を気になりました。あとはJPOPも気になりました。すごい勉強したかったです！Perfumeのおかげで、今まで日本語を勉強してますよ！すごくありがたく思います。だから、この動画を見ると、感動しかないですね。泣きそうですｗ　今まで本当にありがとうございます！これからもリリースよろしくお願いします！♡

You guys should try to raise the awareness about Yamaguchi Maho's case by asking perfume what they think about the case. It's definitely a topic that j-pop idols can relate to.

For those who's clueless, Yamaguchi Maho is a member of NGT48 (sister group of AKB48) who was physically assaulted by 2 fans who allegedly were involved with NGT48 members too. The management of NGT48, backed by AKS (the shareholders of 48G), instead of protecting her rights and safety, they shut her up by persuading her to take a break until one day she had enough of them not doing anything about inlt and even cover up the whole incident. The news went viral and still the management does no meaningful things to resolve the problem and now Maho is graduating with her close friends in protest because the management thing she ASSAULT the group by speaking out about her physical assault and the shit things management did.

That's why you should've bring the topic out, FBE.
Kawaiiii! ~<3

The girl on the left 😍
This was adorable! I think I'm going to check them out
This is awesome!! They’re my favorite girl group! So sad that I missed their show in San jose a few weeks ago... 😭
J-Pop Girl: In Japan, we don't consider ourselves J-Pop....


Bystander: Yeah, wouldn't you just be considered Pop?
OMG YES
i know they're way older than me but i just want to protect even if i don't know them at all
I auditioned for my school's japanese dance club with PREFUME's song 'Pick Me Up' and my friends and used their song (the same one) in our school's talent show! My old japanese language teacher loves perfume as well!
This one came out of nowhere!  It's awesome they had the chance to make their points as well!


By the way, Perfume has been known in the west as far back as 2007, but back then it was only in small circles. I'm a newer fan so I wasn't there, but I'm really glad they grew so much! Their newer stuff is just legendary!
Almost 20 years
Their voices are so pretty <3
Perfume is a underrated legend (
wow I am into Kpop but damn these music video by those groups are very cool
I CAN BELIEVE MY EYES. YES I'M CRYING. I LOVE PERFUME SO MUCH AND THEY ARE AWESOME.
they're so adorable and i love perfume so much
i love them. nochi looks so so soo beautiful!
Oh my goooooood perfume!
English lyrics: (speaking Japanese)


Me: oh... so insightful...
react to kpop: ikon when you gonna do kpop react again someday. PLEASEEE
It's sad bc they probably know FBE chose Laser Beam bc it was "weird Japan". I'm glad Perfume could explain the context which was after one of the most powerful earthquakes in history. After such a disaster people needed joy and laughter. That's what Perfume does best is make fun, cheerful music. Hopefully people check out their amazing songs!
I like these girls. They seem very nice. I’ve never cared for the Japanese language. Just something about it bothers me. Especially in anime. It’s fine in real life. In real life I think it’s pretty cool. But in things like anime and entertainment i don’t really like it and I prefer English. I don’t get why people think it’s cute though. It just sounds like Japanese. I don’t get what’s cute about it. (Probably why I only watch anime in dub) but aside from that they are cool. Not an insult to them by the way.
please react to just the gazette, like u know make them the main focus
I like these girls!!! They are so intelligent and real! And 20 years?!?! They still look like teenagers!!!!
i kept smiling during the whole video 'cause they're just so adorable
They’re sooo cute 💕 I can’t help but adore them 🥰
what about kids/teens react to all 48Groups but don't show them the mv, just show them the live performance. because each group have a different mv quality and concept. and make them choose which 48Group is their favorite.
Okay so now y'all definitely need a teens react to Perfume
since 2000????
How can their voices sounds like that ?? Wayy too cuteeee
Dude Japanese chicks are sooo kawaiiiiii....!!!!

O MY GOD THIS IS SO AMAZING, I LOVE PERFUME , J-POP AND FBE SO MUCH
Have them react to Radwimps' song on Spotify titled "Paparazzi" . It's in English so it'll be interesting to hear the opinions of the reactors on their opinion on paparazzis.
I‘m really happy that you invited Perfume but I think it was pretty impolite to show them an old reaction video that even contained different groups. I would have preferred you making a new reaction to only Perfume. Like they said they have different type of songs and they are so much more than just laser beam. They have been together for 19 years ... you can see that even they were a little disappointed but too polite to say something. :\ anyways for everyone how doesn’t know them I hope they will check them out now! ❤️
They are so cute and pretty! i love their answers. Thank you FBE for having Jpop artist on~
I will definitely listen more to perfume now.
I LOVE PERFUME
金かかってんな〜
The way they talk is so cute.

Teens react to one ok rock.
Japan musics actually have a lot more to show. One especially their "band" artists instead of "idol" artists also produce many great musics.
Please react to Produce x 101
produce101 is K-POP.This is the place of J-POP's topic. Don't come in soon! It doesn't matter! Korean.

Koreans are writing badly in the comment column of "Perfume" MV. Koreans not involved in Japan.
agree with kashiyuka, people might  mark them as j-pop but what they do, instead of doing the same thing or follow what market wants, they just be their self and that's enough.
Can you do a reaction to Twice's fancy?

Cool. Now do a reaction on Kyary Pamyu Pamyu. She’s connected to Perfume by having the same producer, Yasutaka Nakata, who has his own music project CAPSULE. Actually just do more Jpop star reactions. Artists like Daoko, Etsuko Yakyakushimaru, Teddyloid, and Mondo Grosso for example.
They are seriously the most kawaii 30 year olds ever. I love them. I really hope to see them live one day.
They are all so humble, gentle voice and showing encouragement.
私はj-popが好きです
They've been together as a group since the year I was born... Wow, that's actually really impressive!
I saw Perfume appear in 嵐Arashi show, love their music since then.
8:27 SINCE 2000??? damn
So how long until the "Teens-that-became-Adults Reacting to Perfume Reacting to (the same) Teens reacting to J-Pop" video?
This was such a cross-over I never expected to happen. I've been following Perfume since 2008 and to see them here is amazing. Thank you for inviting them over!!

I almost exclusively listen to metal, but seeing the hard work, dedication, and honesty these three have unfolded for us all to see, i can’t say no to listening to their music. And hey, their newest album is pretty damn good. It’s more upbeat than what i usually listen to, but it’s growing on me.

perfumeがまさかFBEにでるとは！！😭
ぜひともEXILEでもやってほしいな
It's always Heavy Rotation. AKB48 have better songs like River, Beginner, Flying Get, Give Me Five, UZA, 365 Nichi no Kami Hikouki, even Koi Suru Fortune Cookie. Next time put Keyakizaka46. They have many cool songs like Silent Majority, Eccentric, Fukyouwaon, Kataru Nara Mirai Wo ...

If they ever bring twice to react I'll jump from a building in happiness.
How could you not love these three people. I love them at first sight.
Please react to ONE OK ROCK!
I love hearing them speak English. You can tell they put a lot of effort, practice, and heart into basically everything that they do. Imo, that is why they're still going strong 20 years later.
O w O
I can't wait for AKB48's turn to react. Please have them as well!

Perfume are so cute I felt in love with them TT
I switched from Jpop to Kpop after the Tohoku earthquake, and haven't followed Perfume in the last 8 years.
Glad to see the beauty of Nocchi again, she has grown as a wonderful woman.
P E R F U M E
Awesome
J-pop groups rarely last longer than a few years. Those that do are really special. Call me old fashioned but my favorite J-pop band has always been Dreams Come True. They are celebrating 30 years together this year! In fact in their early years their bassist Masato Nakamura wrote the original soundtracks to the Sonic the Hedgehog games!
They are 30 years old in 2019.
These girls are so pretty especially the one at the left
I love Perfume so much. They're so cute !
!!!!! PERFUMEE!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW DID YOU DO THIS GUYS!!!!!!
Those voices 0.0
The girl with short hair, she is so pretty and i love her personality does anyone know her name?
Very talented ladies 🙂
I love listening to them talking. So cute
omg pls do a react with one ok rock!!
react to kyary pamyu pamyu!
Actually I am listening to JPOP when i was in highschool and then suddenly KPOP was blasting. But JPOP is cool!
Invite ONE OK ROCK, they are a japanese band who sings in japanese and in english
Perfumeは日本の誇り❗世界中の沢山の人に知ってもらいたい✨
Time to play Dream Fighter to celebrate!
this video is cut strange point!
(i am japanese)
Perfume .!!!! Oh my god.!!!
The fuck is   this old shit?
OMG. Perfume. Awesome Sauce. Yay!
The way she says "exactly"
Perfume, active since 2000, was formed totally by members themselves( at the age of 11, and not by agency). After inviting nocchi to join Perfume at 2001, they have never experience changing of members and pause of gp activities. While witnessing other artists' rise and fall, Perfume keep standing today. 
Moreover, they only reach success after 8 years of hardship. That's the main reason of them always being humble and thankful to every opportunity.
So please check out this legendary group, as it is really rare to see a group keep evolving for over a decade!
So, question. If there are more than 5 members of a group/band who actually gets to sing? I can't believe that some J-pop groups have over 30 members. Is this a Pussycat Dolls scandal where one person sings and the rest are backup dancers?
Fun fact : acchan (the one in the middle) has a little sister who is also an idol
React to Band-maid!
Can you shows teens vpop??? (Viet-pop)
I couldn't stop smiling watching this. They are so sweet 😊
Perfumeがこのチャンネルに出るなんて🙌💓
holy crap FBE, you take this one another level
While I do like Kpop, I still prefer Jpop. I discovered Perfume through Pandora and the first song was 1mm. The song and the music video are amazing! I had 1mm on repeat for many times! I got hooked on their music! They're one of my favorite music groups out there!
J Pop > K Pop > Western Pop < J Pop
They seem sooo so so sweet I wanna  be their friend
I'M AMAZED THAT PERFUME ACTUALLY DOES UNDERSTAND ENGLISH! ALSO A-CHAN PROVES IT BY REPEATING THE WORDS THAT THE TEEN SAID YAAAAAA
A-chan's "Exactly" and Kashiyuka's "thank you so much" are so cute 😍
React to Nogizaka46 please🙏🏻🙏🏻
they are soo adorable im crying ;v;
I love Perfume. The music is not my cup of tea but they are so good, and their stage show is so amazing. I saw them at SXSW a few years ago and again this year. If you get a chance, go see them.
Yaay! Big sister PERFUME!! 
Wish there was an only Perfume video reaction for them to react to but this is awesome as well! :)
I just watched that earlier
Nocchi (far left) is so dreamy <3
when y’all finally acknowledging my girls from perfume ♥️♥️
3人の笑顔本当に癒される〜
It may be just because I have little exposure to Japanese culture, but I think their voices are very unique and sweet
Finally, I've been wanting more jpop content 👌
They got no streaming for coachella first week.. but coachella learned their mistake and stream their second week performance.. rolling stones listed them in 16 best act to watch at coachella..impressive!!
omg my queens on my favorite channel 😭😭
Waifusssssss
J-pop > K-pop

I recommend Perfume's FLASH and Pick Me Up :D The songs are refreshing :D
Wow..20 years? Respect!
Stan Perfume! THEY ARE AMAZING!
Blah bla bla im speaking Japanese but wait im speaking English right now
They sound like straight up anime characters
Well, I didn't expect them to sound just like anime girls.
Hope Jpop gets Popular too, not only KPop TT
K-POP: weirdly girl-face boys with similar looks and fanatic girls in fun
J-POP: weirdly animated cover with another choreograph with fun
20 years
I really enjoy this video because its rare to see other jpop group reviewing other groups and hear their opinion about it.
FINALLY
Yeah, Perfume!! you guys are so cool!!
they're look just like middle-twenties girl tbh
They should react to a react of only their mvs not other groups!

Perfume's recent stuff is super approachable for international audiences. They're much more than music with the way they incorporate technology with their performances. It would be nice to show people their recent stuff because IT SLAPS
I've suddenly gotten the urge to binge watch some anime cartoons.
Perfume is unlike any other artist! Those ladies can rock a stage for sure! I love Perfume and look forward to what comes next! (Btw their Future Pop concert was awesome!) 😉 ❤️ 
Much love from Texas!

they're so sweet! i didn't realise they've been around since 2000! the way they spoke about their recent music makes me want to check them out!
Thought Dragon ball super ended a year ago, what in the blue hell
Do more jpop!!!
The way they talk ! Am moving to Japan to find my wife
Their voices are very soft and calming wthhh
I listen to j-pop so I support Japan and the Anime love Japan music and you three Japan Singers reacting I am already a fan of yours 😊😊
me: omg nct have so many members

akb: hold my beer
The reactors were so young in that video lol
Awesome video not a J-Pop or K-Pop fan but people who are nice
Ack! Asians are my weakness when it comes to adorable h00mans!
Pls react to eurovision songcontest 2019😍
Why are they reacting to this now when the video is old

I understand this video is about j pop but Tori's hair tho
"a lot of rough times" ... FUCK OFF. Cute Rich Popular girls, cry me a fucking river. These girls would be part of the japan's suicide statistic if they had to live a 1/10 of my life.
They speek like anime character
Do baby metal
what is this? i can't stop smiling...much cuteness
It's so interesting to see J-Pop stars and bands reacting to western people reacting to their music. Normally we see us reacting to them but not the other way around, it's very interesting. I would like to see more stuff like this. It would be really interesting if the people in the original video reacted to this video to see how Perfume reacted to their original points and views. That would be really interesting. Great video.
I grew up listening to Judy&Mary, had a mega crush on Yuki isoya...still do but that’s not the point. Randy too, he’s in a group now called maziora and Yuki went solo long time ago. I wish they’d come together for one night alone even if they charged a million for one ticket I’d still get a backstage pass
I love them so much! And their voices are so calming! <3
Yes!!! I love perfume 💕💕
Omg they are so cute. ♡♡♡♡
Early
What the heck is J POP is that like K pop but worse? Ok sorry I take back what I said I know what it means now
Omg! So cute.. I love hearing the Japanese language.. So soothing
I can't help myself seeing them as anime characters lol. Too much subbed anime and all cutsie Japanese sounds like it's from anime
SO... CUTE!!!!
I want them to react to Pentatonix's Perfume Medley :)
theyre so cuteeee ):
That was pretty cool. Love the Kpop reactions but now i'm hoping for more Jpop too!!


what about reacting to that group IZ*one for a future Kpop reaction? they have both Kpop and Jpop songs! Well, many kpop debut in japan and have japan only songs too but what makes them unique is they where formed from a idol creation show that featured AKB members as contestants. Pretty sure their rise in popularity as a group is because of the show, but they did win rookie of the year and their first 2 songs have won first place in voting music shows multiple times.


Other than that, maybe react to K.A.R.D? they seem to appear in youtube videos often. i don't know the process, nor do i know the difficulty, but maybe you could also get them to react to the reaction
When y’all gonna react to NAV
Perfume is so pure and beautiful, i love them so much ! 💫💕

Holy crap, i thought they WERE 20, not performing for 20 years...did they start at birth? Even after knowing it, they still look to be in their 20's to me!
Jpop is really good . I'm not a huge fan but I do like some songs and this years I fell in love with 2 songs that I can't stop listening to . I only got into female groups tho lol . But I will definitely recommend jpop to the kpop fans .
They are sooo polite oh my god

AAA ITS PERFUME MY CHILDHOOD JPOP BAND
They're  sweet and cute but their music videos don't really mean make sense so it's hard to follow the story or even follow their lives because it's so strict I would have never known I enjoyed Kpop because it's more edgy an Americanized Style J-pop seems to be hidden and I don't think that's fair to them as artists we should be able to see them Express themselves a little bit more I think they're being controlled by music executives that don't see the Artistry anymore they just see the paycheck
React to Sawano Hiroyuki
Thank you FBE ! Please more Japanese artist, singer, group reaction!

A friend of mine shared this vid with me this morning and I had a mini freak out. I love Perfume so much! I know most of their songs by heart too. :D
For anyone out there who doesn't know this group where have you been? Lol Jk.  If you're wondering, from left to right their names are: Nocchi, A-Chan, and Kashiyuka. (Nocchi's real name is Ayano and A-Chan's real name is Ayaka, btw.) 
I hope this video will get more people into J-pop. Perfume is an amazing group that can be enjoyed by anyone no matter the age or whatever. Thanks FBE this made my day!

PERFUUUUME
I watched the previous video when it was published, and I was already a big fan of Perfume.It's really touching to see them react to that video after more than 5 years. 

I want the boys and girls to watch their performance in Coachella 2019 or the latest MV.
Perfume have improved more and more. 

And, thank you FBE for making such a wonderful video!
it would be great if Japanese actually make their mv like this public, cus some of the group or band sometimes can only be seen tru japan internet only, i don't understand the policy to keep it private when they wanted to be popular ? 🤔
So happy to see them react to this ! They are so lovely and I like how they are understanding when it comes to our cultural differences and why we sometime don't get what's happening in Japan music culture.
i love perfume :)
We want AKB48 and the 48group too!
DO THAT TO AKB48 TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This video was good but the best part was to was as 10:53
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.... PERFUUUUUMMMEEEEEE omg I love them :')

Perfume reacts to Pentatonix - Perfume Medley
React to kris wu
The way they talk seems like they're singing a lullaby... so calm~ so soft~ so kawaii~ I love it! 

Jpop may seem weird to people but I think it's just because their creativity is unlimited, varied and out of the box.
I kinda use to listen to j pop but now i listen to k pop, and i like k pop lol but yeahhhhhh hahahha
FBE definitely should do another J-pop video. Perfume is such an incredible legendary group. Their song "Spending all my time" is still one of my all time fave tracks. I love their unique place in the j-pop scene. So great that you had them on the show.
They SOUND SOO CUTE!!!
Omg perfume you guys serious
THEY ARE 30?! HOW ARE THEY 30?! THEY LOOK 25 MAX
If you could only relate jpop to anime ...well fine I could use acg( and other anime)stuff to get you in Perfume too!

- Perfume songs and choreography is always used for MMD (e.g. Hurly Burly, nee, perfect star perfect style, dream fighter etc). You can find them easily by searching VOCALOID and idolm@ster MMD
- Three of them love the manga chihayafuru. While their song 'FLASH' is the theme song of live action film of 'chihayafuru'. 
- Kashiyuka(the one who sits on the right hand side) loves shonen manga. She loves jojo's blizzard adventure the most! 
- The author of one piece seems to be a fan of Perfume
- The producer of Perfume has arranged a theme song for one piece exhibition 
- The producer also has arranged songs for studio kajino, which is related to studio ghibli
- The producer is a friend of Noto Mamiko, who is a voice actress
- Nocchi(the one who sits on the left) loves manga too. She also loves playing video games!
- Both Nocchi and Kashiyuka had been mentioned on manga Haikyuu chapter 200th
- Nocchi had once mentioned Lovelive reminds her about the hard days Perfume had in the past. 
- Watch μ's reacting on Perfume's pick me up live! People says Perfume maybe the origin of A-rise. 
- Mirai no museum is the theme song of film Doraemon: Nobita's Secret Gadget Museum

What about the girl who sits on the middle? Oh she is a~chan and she is such an angel!! A~chan is very kind and the most social person in the group. She has a lot of friends and I love her! 

Please check Perfume out and I am sure you won't regret!
It's so wierd when real people talk in Japanese..  I'm used to anime characters talking in Japanese.
omg can u make teens react to p pop (philippine pop)
Their laughs are so cute. Wtf.
Perfume姉さんの進化は止まらないもんね～
え、perfumeこれ聞き取れんの？？
Pleeaaase make more reactions for new Japanese songs... New Perfume things, Kenshi Yonezu, 46 groups (especially keyakizaka46)...
ACan you do next adult react to nep pop?
Nepali pop music
They themselves are even saying "I wish they'd watch our recent videos" and "Our newer videos are way cooler". They are too polite to say it but I feel like they too are a bit disappointed that the video they were shown was old and know that they have way more impressive stuff to show now. A new video reacting to Perfume's Future Experiments would really do the trick, or heck just another J-pop reaction in general would be nice. But not having made another J-pop video to show the legendary trio that is Perfume when you get them on your show? This is embarrassing FBE.
Achan, Nocchi and Kashiyuka...you girls are amazing.
Girl on left looks like tiffany
Wait, what? 20 years? I've been listening to them for 20 years?! mind blown
The one on the left is BEAUTIFUL! that smile!
My Queens💕 Thank you for featuring them! I recommend people to check out their performances at coachella, they did really well!
I hope all j-pop/k-pop artist die in a pit of firey dot shit

omg perfume <3 you are wonderful as always. so happy i got to see them up close in san jose
"Lazer beam" released in 2011.
Now they progress their performance! I hope everybody watch their performance on You tube.

Please do a "Teens React To J-pop Stars React To Teens React To J-pop" to see how their thought change about J-pop

PERFUME!!!!!!!!!!!
I really love A~chan's confusing face when she looked at the polar bear at laser beam PV
One would think that watching anime would make you fluent in Japanese but nope lol
But the language is very familiar to me. At least I can tell the difference between Japanese and Korean and Chinese. Lol
i remember seeing the preform in Akihabara  when they was like 10yrs old (age not group length) singing Akiba Love
their response is like the 5 animal group in movie Sing...
Haven't seen perfume in such a long time!!

I would love for you guys to do an updated version of the Teens React to JPOP with the same reactors and the latest music videos of the same groups. It can put a lot of perspective on the growth of these groups plus you guys can discuss the graduation system of AKB since Jiwaru Days is a farewell music video for Sashihara Rino, who is probably one of if not the most popular member of AKB.
Many people don't know that Kpop's play count and billboard rankings are being manipulated improperly.

Perfume are so revolutionary and were so ahead of their time. If FBE showed the teens some of their live performances a lot of them may have thought twice about not exploring J-Pop more. What sets these girls apart is not only their music but the way incorporate technology and performance together.
Next up have BlackPink react to the reactors
Yep! Now plz do a reaction to Kenshi Yonezu so I can finally die smh
It'd be awesome if you reacted to Wanima (Japanese rock band)

OMG they're 30!
I have no words for this...
2:49 is so cute omggg
OMG you got perfume on here!!!! I LOVE THEM.
kawaii
Awesome to see them there. I've listened to a bit of J-Pop in my 30 years of watching the intros and outros of anime. Perfume was actually one of the first J-Pop groups I started listening to and one of the first J-Pop music videos I've seen about 20 years ago.
Dear god the comments 🙄 don't  fetishise people you weebs.
You should do try not to move but i found a video thats full of jump scares try it pls if you can search it
Jpop a lot of times is compared to Kpop. they don't even sound the same though. Not every JPop fan will be a KPop fan and vice versa so we should stop comparing like saying J-Pop > K-Pop or whatever.


Though I'm not that invested in JPop, idk how many J-Pop groups are out on YT aside from Perfume since Japan is a lot more strict with sharing their music. I did recently have an interest because of groups like Flower and seeing clips but imo I don't find that kind of hook I get from K-Pop.
react to band maid
Actual Japanese Girls talk more weird than the Anime girls.... WTF Japanese girls.

I've been listening to Perfume since 2007 and I'm so happy for their success! And even though they have had many achievements and impact on jpop they're still so humble! I can only  wish all the best to them  ❤️
Sry auto correct
I meant FBE
Hey foe you guys should react to the new chucky trailer 2 and have them react to it
Thank you @FBE so much for giving a great opportunity for Perfume, they could talk about themselves interestedly and that is made me happy. For J-Pop I’m a Perfume stan, they have a special thing to change J-pop industry’s image, please give their chance to show how they’ve been doing so far (their works,success and opinions) what did people thinking about? Hope you will mention to these girls more 🙏🏻🎈😊
5:00 Nocchi's quiet "Yeah..." i'm deceased she's so cute
Is because Kpop is killin Jpop.
There is NO way you can not make a follow up react to Perfume video!!! Please!!! There is so many great songs and videos from Perfume for people to be missing on them.

I wish react get Daoko have her react to  other you tubers about mememe
Youtubers react to Lia Marie Johnson
Omg I love perfume, it’s so crazy that you got them to react!
I do like these videos. Even though I'm not into the music, it helps me appreciate other countries, and exposes me to some really cool stuff.
Jmetal, CROSSFAITH PLEASEEEE!
Who else didn’t know there was j-pop 🤦🏽‍♀️
Mann i didnt know they were beautiful in real life. That reaction video was made years ago. Its good they react to them hahaha
And if you guys didn’t know BABYMETAL is in the same company with perfume so perfume is BabyMetal senior !!! 🥰
i definately think a new reaction video should be made! as mentioned by the girls, Jpop has so many more elements to it now. Baby Metal, themselves (Perfume), Namie Amuro, AKB48, and many more artists who are Jpop actually have such different feels to them because of their concepts, sub-genres and much more. It's just as vibrant of a genre as kpop is <3 i was honored to see Perfume in Chicago TWICE and they performed so well both times. Even stopping the show for a little bit to talk to fans!
You guys should totally do another ep about Jpop, but this time with more variety. For idols shows Keyakizaka46 (they're the best digital seller of SakamichiAKB), soloists they have Kenshi Yonezu or Aimyon, bands with Sekai No Owari or One OK Rock and many more. The music industry of Japan is honestly so big, diverse and amazing that more people should know about them.
PERFUME Luv u @ Coachella! 😍
On stage they are perfection
I LOVE YOU PERFUME! FROM MALAYSIA ❤❤❤
I saw them this year in Chicago! They are amazing! It's one of the best events I have been to!
Perfumeeeeee 😍😍
They reacted to a video more than 4 years old???


I love the group but this reaction just...it's not even relevant really. I'm sorry :(

I would've much preferred to see Perfume watch/react to a more recent video.
Hey can you guys please react to stray kids? I've said this a million times now and I really just hope that you'd finally notice me. Stray kids are already there in the usa and even if you don't invite them, it's alright. I just want them to be familiar with stray kids. Thanks
J-POP > K-Poop

Awesome
HAVE THEM REACT TO PERFUME AGAIN!!! TEENS COLLEGE KIDS PARENTS ADULTS SENIORS! ALL OF THEM!
ko ni chiwa ladies I am a fan :)
Y'know how celebrities come out and surprise the reactors? This would've been a cool opportunity to flip the script and have Tom and Tori (since they're somewhat readily available) to come out and meet the band. Something to keep in mind for the next time something like this happens.
One of the older statesmen of j-Pop. They've been at it for nearly two decades now. Much respect.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS MY OG QUEENS!!!!!
To everyone wanting to check them out after seeing this, please do and thank you! I have been a Perfume fan for like 10 years and I'm so happy that they're getting more international exposure especially with their appearance at Coachella ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I’ve been watching these girls since I was 13 (26 now), and I swear they haven’t aged a day since then. Whatever skin care routine they use I want in
I'm wondering whatever happened to all of the J-Pop groups after the rise of K-Pop.
Nostalgic and Classic

Fucking do a Jpop reaction 2
I listen to some J pop, but just the ones that become the opening or closing theme song for an anime that I watch.
A~Chan is everything to me
perfume!!!
Can you do doctors react and diagnose to final destination deaths from 1-5? If you can though.
You should react to, “Dear person that broke my heart”
Genuinely shocked and ecstatic to see these ladies in your studio. And just as happy to be reminded that even after almost twenty years, they managed to release arguably their best record ever. And just like in their music, during the interview they just ooze classiness and sincerety that is otherwise hard to find in the whole music industry, let alone when it comes to such excessively processed genres. So much heart,  such a legacy. Thank you so much for inviting them! ❤️
Where do I sign up to stan?
OH MY GOD MY GIRLSNXNUFJDINFKJDJ
They were 11 when they started!! 😲
Wow  Perfume！
Pls react to lia Marie Johnson
They are so cute OMG 😍 My heart is melting 😍🤭 #loveperfume
OMFG YOU GOT PERFUME?!?! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Their voices reminded me of detective conan
If anyone watched As The Gods Will or Kami-sama no Iu Toori, they can see the reason for the polar bear.
Omg this is lit my heart!!!
If I'd been reacting to this, I would have started babbling. "Oh, Jpop? Let me show you some Utada, Ayumi, Kalafina..." We all woulda learned stuff together.
Teens react to Godzilla the series
Wow Perfume, their Coachella performance was great

Edit: I am very impressed by their long journey for a pop group

I used to listen to Perfume when I was in college (about 12 years ago). I've moved on to different interests, but I am happy to see they are still together making music!
They should react to https://youtu.be/jcIOg_m-bp4
i'm a simple guy. if i see no kpop i click like.
when the person was asking the girls questions, did the girls understand english and respond? or was there an interpreter that was just cut out of the video and had their voice replaced by the english speaking interviewer?
Lowkey my only familiarity with this group is Pentatonix's Perfume Medley from I think 2016
The original video is four years old, come on now smh
PERFUME ON FBE WOW
Recognized akb48 right away because I actually watched akb0048 long time ago, that is like a guilty pleasure of mine lol

react to lia marie johnson
I prefer jrock and jmetal more
Oh my! perfume !!! I love them!
I've been following jpop since early 2000's, if you need some recommendations, you should do new episode reacting to Chuning Candy, =LOVE, Flowback, Color Creation, Re:Complex. These are recent jpop groups gaining popularity and i highly recommend their music.
they’re so cute....... I love them
These young ladies are wonderful role models for young people. I'm glad that they were confused about the music video because I just thought I was just too far out of date to comprehend. I wish these women every happiness!!!
React to one ok rock, we are. 18fes version
React to one ok rock, we are. 18fes version

React to one ok rock, we are. 18fes verision
If you were going to invite perfume to fbe wouldn’t it be nice to do a reaction dedicated to them? It seems like the respectful thing to do.
HELLL YEAH!

Edit: Damn they look fine
You should do another J-pop episode now!😉 Maybe more perfume, see if some of the same reactors recognize them!😁
So cute voice
AAAAA I LOOOVE ❤️❤️
Thanks for the nice video! 

While Perfume are so sweet, down-to-earth, and  easy-going personally, they performance are on the opposite end, as in Caochella.
I think that is why they are so unique and still popular after 20 years.
YES
Love this is so cute <3
They're so cute and fun
Perfume if you are reading this, I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH! Keep doing what you do :)
React to one ok rock
React to Produce 101, Produce 101 szn 2, Produce 48, etc etc. all the produce competitions
NOCCHI♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
When you put captions on😁
I think you should have teens react to J-rock this time. I think some will enjoy it. They might even hear some  songs from their favorite anime.
Perfume is the very first J-pop groupni ever fell for in 2010 and I'm so happy to see them on the show. They're so talented and their music is really amazing.
THEY ARE SO CUTE and wow how old are they? 
They’ve been together since 2000 but they look like they’re in their early 20’s 😧
J-Pop and K-Pop should combine in a big collab with BTS and some J-Pop band (I dunno which one)
Whoa.... It's been years when I watched that video.. I wouldn't have imagined it would be reacted now... TwT

P.S. their pronunciation is kind of good coming from Japanese.. XD
It was because of the original video that I started listening to Perfume and other J-pop/J-rock groups. It's so cool to see them react to it!
I think it would be nice to see a react video of JRock (artists like UVERworld, LiSA, ASCA, MY FIRST STORY, Minami, ...)
I LOVE Perfume! They are so amazing and sweet. I loved seeing them in Chicago ❤️❤️❤️
The girl on the right gives me Hinata vibes
Perfume my girls that I've been with since 2008 💕💕
Yaass!!!! QUEENS!!!!!! Perfume!!!
Thank you so much for this video! I even teared up, for real... I've been following the girls for like 15 years and I'm so proud and happy to see them still blessing us as Perfume. I really hope one day I get to see them live, they are amaaaaazing performers! Thank you for all these years, we love you Perfume! ♥
Does any one listen to Chanmina
React to akb48 and whole 48g

Still waiting for some 'One OK Rock' that I'm sure most of the reactors will like.

Please make a video reaction of the kpop group Dreamcatcher!!!!!!
It's not really your job but could you please check up on Lia Marie Johnson? I'm worried about her :(
I can’t believe you got Perfume!!! I’m hoping they do something at the 2020 olympics next year!
Everybody in this generation love Kpop.
FBE or anyone who has contact with Lia Marie Johnson please make sure she's doing ok. We need to spread awareness
Shit. I thought the video for "Laser beam" was shot before the earthquake, which was why we never got the full version of it until after. Unless they shot the bear stuff afterwards.

If it weren't for Perfume, I would've never went to Japan and studied Japanese for a semester. Still love them to them to this day, I wish I could've seen them while I was still in Fukuoka though.

the one on the left is banging like  a big biscuit
Perfume was fun to watch and I like how they related to what the reactors said. I love watching the episodes where people react to music from other countries. It is even better when those artist react to the initial reactions. To continue the flow would you please react to music from China.
Aww, I love Perfume! How awesome to see them on React! I can't believe they've been together for nearly 20 years! It seems like just yesterday that I came across their music...
Omg did they debut when they were 10 years old?
No puedo dejar de mirar a Ayano! Can't stop looking at her beauty!!

React to Steve Irwin
Beautiful women. A lot of talent. Thanks to jpop I also follow kpop. Great music to enjoy from both countries. For me way better than western pop.
Gambareee
Kids react to Twice.
FINALLY!!! I LOVE PERFUME!!😍😍😍💖💖💖
You guys should have reacted to more Perfume songs before getting them to react to the teens. :(
But it was great seeing them here. After Momoland I never thought you'd put another artist/group I love.
Also, it's kind of unfair that in that Jpop reaction video there were only 3 videos, because the genre is so wide, like way wider than regular pop or even Kpop. It has everything (good or bad), and it's almost impossible to be up to date with all these new releases and artists debuting. Perfume make really great music though, not "regular" Jpop. More like EDM or Electropop, but in Japanese (and tbh really cool music, not "kids music").
I am from Brazil and I love Perfume (Jpop) Amazing!
You’ve done “Do They Know Disney Channel Theme Songs”, please do, “Do They Know DCOM songs.” Examples: HSM, Cheetah Girls, Camp Rock, Lizzie McGuire Movie, Teen Beach Movie, Descendants, Zombies
Twice is A Jpop group too.
Biggest Perfume fan. This is incredible!
It's too bad you never did a reaction episode about Perfume's Future-Experiment Vol.1. An epic performance where Yuka was in London, Ayano in New York and Ayaka in Japan. The performance was shown in Japan with each girl performing simultaneous and 2 of them were holographic projections broadcast to Japan in real time. The fans were wondering "what the..." when only Ayaka came out for the performance until the projectors came on. To choreograph a performance from 3 different continents, Well worth a watch.
Literally.. Idk why but it's satisfy when they speak xd
Perfume最高！
Ok so this is what I'm doing rn

Omg Perfume in the flesh, 💝💖💗💓💚💛❤️💟❣️🖤💜💙💕💞
It's good to see international music reacts. So when are you doing a Romanian Pop video? Or Turkish Pop video 2?
The thing I've always loved about the Japanese language since I first heard it when I was 13 is that half the time, dare I say, it sounds very sensual, but half the time it sounds militant and badass.
react to Azerrz or Frog Leap Studios
Make them react to Jpop again please!
Aaah Perfume I love them so much! Been a fan for the last 8 years. Pleasant surprise to see them here ♥️

Their outfits are sooooo pretty
so this is the group that Gintama keeps refering to :DDD
perfume literally looks so young wtf
Are those their real voices, or do they just talk like that while on camera?
When I first saw this React video, I thought to myself that Perfume was like the Japanese Destiny's Child just based on their video
OMG!! FINALLY!!!!!! something bout Jpop!!! 😩😭😭😭😭 Arigatoooo!
This group is one of the OG Japan girl groups, thou!! But they all look so young😍✨✨
Now you do them... now that they are fucking old and outdated
I really impress with FBE able to invite Perfume. Hoping for other artists from other countries as well.
I love Perfume so much!! Thank you so much for making this FBE!! :3

Waw, that JPOP reaction video is so how many years ago......
Omg nocchi beautiful
Wow.. ❤
PLEASE PLEASE FBE, I AM BEGGING YOU DO ELDERS REACT TO TUPAC SHAKUR, PLEASE I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS FOR YEARS. Please do elders react to Tupac Shakur
react to the IT Chapter 2 trailer!
b
Can we do another episode on reacting jpop please since we haven't done it for a very long time...
I have missed them omg!
LOL those girls more very giggly LOL
How old are they?! How young did they start?! 20 years!?
perfumeやん？！
Wow, they’re so humble and respectful.
This is the content I've wanted for years... thank you
they’re so cute omg
kids react to Kyary Pamyu Pamyu would work SOOOO well too, just sayin'. The original Poppy.
I know hatsune miku is a vocaloid, but I mean can she still be considered a jpop star since she is really popular in Japan? Also, I love Japanese music including vocaloid, it's so amazing. 😄😄😄
I'm more into J-pop than K-pop and I love Perfume.☺
react to stray kids
Been a long-time Perfume fan here. So proud and happy to see them come so far and finally get the recognition they've long deserved in the US.
I love them so much, but how did they understand what the teens were saying in the video??
Perfume is amazing!Seriously, check them out!
Can you do the next episode of react to JPOP but with Reol and Daoko, it would be amazing :D
Theyve been together 19 years??? Thats amazing also they look like early 20s.
React to stray kids please?
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING PERFUME I LOVE THEM
Can we finally have a Teens react to 48g and its international groups? Or another Teens react to J-Pop?
They really could have prepared a bit for this. The J-pop reaction video is very old now and there was only one Perfume song in it. The least they could have done would have been to have made more parts where they showed more J-pop and more recent Perfume videos. There have been A LOT of K-pop videos on this channel and they couldn't even bother to muster up one more J-pop video before having one of the biggest names in Japanese music on here? That's unprofessional to me.
Nee- nee
Have you guys done Miyavi yet?
Thanks FBE for the re-connection to Perfume! <3
Omg I love Perfume so much ;-; they're so sweet and talented!! Daijobanai is still my favorite song!
Not into J-pop but K-pop is where it's at.
Difference between J-Pop and Western Music bands, they stay together and don't go solo after 3-5 years together.
please reach out to lia :(
めっちゃびっくりしたんだがあ！？
Ahhhhhhhhh make a kids react to Perfumeeeee <3 <3 <3 <3
They are so cute, natural. Not star-like at all. So down to Earth.
20 years!!
You should do a reaction to the gazette. One of the biggest j-rock bands!!!
Please react to Tank and The Bangas!
I love perfume ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
They are one of my favorite jpop groups ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍

they're so cute omg 🥺
their voices.. so soft!
their voices.. so soft!
Girl on the right looks like Xioayou from Meteor Garden
It's so interesting to see the cultural differences. even between jpop/kpop male/female. it would be fun to have reactors see differences between different cultures and have an explanation of the different trends that can be observed between them.
Wow perfume, please do more Japanese artist,
This is so cute! More of this! I love how you brought this back to life from 2015 😂 Also cpop, please!
Can you please do teens react to finneas o connell?
i remember listening to some of their songs in middle school,,, oof i feel old now
They need more attention but since it’s J pop and not K pop it’s not 🙄




I’m not shading K pop btw I’m a ARMY ❤️
I love them so much i have been a fan of theirs since i was a 11 and have been following them since and they definitely have come a long away together! love you Perfume!!!!
Oh my freaking god! I have been listening to perfume since the 2000s. My first Perfume song was Chocolate Disco and thought that it was catchy, weird, and just interesting. I've been hooked ever since. They're performances and shows are incredible and you guys should check them out!
Their reactions are adorable. ><
Perfume, the absolute queens of J-Pop.
Yooo these girls are so damn cute, need to get into their music - on my way there now
IM SO SHOCKED
PLEASE TRY TO GET TWICE WHEN THEY COME TO USA to react to all the videos of them. They coming to Los Angeles, CA in July 17!!!!!!!!!! TWICE React to  ALL KPOP REACTS 🙏
Perfume kawaiii! ❤️
They all looks so young. How have they been together for 20 years they don't look much older than 20. Wtf
In México, we LOVE PERFUME 💜
React to Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas (Japan)band
God I remember seeing that video so long ago, all the teens are grown up now
I love perfume 😍😍
these girls are adorable
Nope.
if you can, could you guys react to e-girls (exile girls)? they're another j-pop girl group who happen to me one of my favorite bands!
Teens react to TK from Ling Tosite Sigure
Yousei Teikoku?
Pls youtubers react to perfume's mv.

STAN PERFUME COWARDS OMG 😮

Hello

YESS PURFUME!UwU I love them so much

الملكات QUEENS 😭😭😍😍🤩
Wow, perfume went from 600,000 to 700,00
Watching all that anime finally paid off❤️❤️😂
Ooooow, my favourite group appears!!! The best day ever 😍
React to IT 2
I POOPED
Honestly though, if you're going to invite Perfume to the show, you should've done a new or more recent J-pop reaction video. At least make a Perfume exclusive reaction video on their MVs or live performances or even their Coachella performances ~~ This is like from so long ago. It felt like a waste to have them react to such an old video.

Rants aside, I'm glad that FBE still considers inviting Japanese artists to the show since it's been K-pop K-pop K-pop all this time. Now it's time to make a new J-pop reaction video, even better, a J-Rock reaction video and try to invite One Ok Rock~
I almost screamed when I saw perfumed.Perfume is one of the best Jpop groups out there!
Ugh the Future Pop Tour, Coachella, and now YouTube 😭
WWWOOOOAAAAHHH!!!!!
MY BABIES PERFUME
Yaaaassss love Perfume! 💗💗💗
Perfume!!! 💕💖
It’s what you deserve queens!!!
Thank you😍😍😍

OH MY GOD ITS PERFUME 😍😍
Perfume, my long time faves.
This was unexpected but welcomed
They talk in such a cute way😭👌🏾😂❤️
I love how sweet they are.  Really impressed with how far they've come and happy for them.
I love perfume!!!!! I've only followed them since pick me up but they're such a talented group! I'm glad you got them on the channel!
I remember them more from the Vitamin drop song and the 2001 PV, and I wonder if they can get a hold of that cast to see that, cause that was a long time ago, and the line up have completely changed
get out with this weeb shit
Their voices are so cute
I LOVE THEN OMG I'M CRYING
instead of perfume which is not in my generation ..pls bring keyakizaka46..nogizaka46 or hiragana46...or mybe gerenation react to their music video..plss
Please react to One Ok Rock! They have just finished touring with Ed Sheeran in Japan, and their music is absolutely amazing!
I love this channel it has inspired me to come out of my comfort zone and make my own YouTube reaction channel ..love the content 🤗🤗🤗
I definitely need to start listening to Perfume btw 可愛い
I Love Japanese music
JpOp

WIG JUST DISINTEGRATED

THIS IS PERFUME💕
ITS PERFUME
I knew this was going to happen. ❤️❤️
OMG I never thought I'd see Perfume on FBE!!! We need updated React videos for their new stuff!!
OMG, I wasn’t expecting a video like this, I love Perfume and I love that you got them in reacting to your J-Pop video 😊 (and no I don’t feel weird liking them just because I’m a boy, I like Kyary Pamyu Pamyu toI) 😊 KAWAII J-POP IS THE BEST J-POP 😊
Thank you for this video. Perfume is such an amazing group with amazing videos, music and choreographies, also the members are sweet and funny. I love them so so so much.
I root for perfume since i was a kid.
Wtf this is cute mostly bc they speak in japanese
I actually like some JPOP. I have found quite a few Japanese artists to be very good such as LiSa and Babymetal.
PERFUME!!
"Are you guys happy to be here?"
"Yes! I'm SOOOO happy!" 
I just busted the biggest uwu
You have to react to Coke studio Pakistan now. It's amazing music. And if you could somehow get Atif Aslam on the show,that would be insane
Why don't any of your videos have reaction to edm festival or music videos?? The last one was skrillex that also was old...
Reacy to One Ok Rock! J-Rock!
Random person: what is J-pop?
Me: Anime intros weebo activates

Still waiting on a Dempagumi reaction. Even as their original members have started leaving, their PVs are made for reacting.

They’re so cute and adorable
Someone please give (direct me to where I can watch more perfume.)me some Pefume content I can watch
Omg plz react to Mrs. GREEN APPLE
Imagine after 20 years in this industry, they're still going steady, no scandal and still exploring opportunities. They were practically nobody the first 5 years after debut, but they kept on going. Loyalty and perseverance would get you so far in life.
Perfume are more amazing live
I hope I can go to their show one day ☺️☺️
Holy crap, 20 years? It's uncommon for normal pop groups in Japan to stay together that long :o
Nobody:
Nobody ever:
Japanese: (has a squeaky anime voice that actually sounds natural)
Pls have them react to keyakizaka46 FBE!!
they'll change your whole prospective of idol groups in jpop.
Teens react to Arctic monkeys please
The way they speak is so freakin cute. They're just so cute in general my god.
C-pop next?
PERFUMEEE!!!
"it's unbelievable that we can actually do sold out shows in countries where we've never been to" 
Because you three girls are the most special Electro pop group in the world! That's why <3
You've done J-Pop, now you need to do a reaction for J-Rock in a variety of genres:

Band-Maid: hard rock
One OK Rock: emo rock
Maximum the Hormone: nu-metal
Scandal: alternative rock
Polkadot Stingray: indie rock
Man With a Mission: alt metal
Unlucky Orpheus: symphonic metal
The Peggies: garage rock

There are so many really good rock/metal bands coming out of Japan right now. People mistakenly just think "weird" when they hear "Japan," but the rock scene is just incredible.
So proud of perfume 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Who is the one on the left? The short haired one, I like her laugh, she is so cute💓
Y'ALL ACTUALLY GOT PERFUME ON HERE!!!

This is so cool!  I love Perfume and am happy to see this video!
2:48 I don't know who that dude is but get on that she called you cute
Wow they sound so high
I urge anyone watching this to explore Perfume's music. I'm sure you'll find at least one song you will enjoy and LOVE. I found out about their music in September last year and it's seriously among the best things that have ever happened to me.


Besides, look at them, for God's sake! They're adorable, mild-mannered, respectful and amazing!
Need more Jpop/rock/metal reactions
uhmm.. can you just please stop comparing j-pop to kpop? those two are different from each other. Either way, they produce beautiful music.  and please respect and appreciate the two of them.

I remember being obsessed with Perfume. Whilst I grew out of my JPop phase, Perfume still holds a space in my heart and my music library, because honestly their music is just so catchy and amazing. Nocchi, A-Chan and Kashiyuka (names from left to right) are all absolutely lovely, precious, adorable and so sweet and talented <3

What does J-POP mean??
Perfume members: talk for eternity

Translation: Hello
A.k.a, budget K-POP
I grew up listening to Jpop, so i can handle pretty much some weird songs from them. For a new listeners, it's gonna be really hard to accept that at first.
Gods they are beautiful....

The one on the left😍😍😍
How come J-pop is reacting to teens react to J-pop 4 years later?
Since you got Perfume to come to your studio.
TIME TO UPDATE THE J-POP REACTION !!!
Can't believe my girls are on this channel! I love perfume!
I think you should do an updated J-pop video. I remember the original video but didn't realize it was that long ago. There's been a good amount of Kpop videos here (which Im thankful for), but it would be cool to see some of the new faces (or maybe even some of the adults or something) react to some newer stuff, maybe even one of Perfume's newer videos, or live performances from one of their Japan dome shows. I was never into j-pop really until I discovered Perfume a few months ago and now I've been so hooked on them.

A plus to this video is that what they were reacting to included other groups as well, so you could kind of get their input not only on the teens reacting but also to the other groups, which can sometimes be rare to see.
OOR please
I thought it was called k pop or something
I thought nct had many members (21) but guess jpop said: hold my bear
React to lankybox plz

Omfggggggg, PERFUME ON FBE!!!!!!!!!!!!

PLS REACT TO KEYAKIZAKA46, NOGIZAKA46 AND HINATAZAKA46 (JPOP)
Oh so that's why youtube recomended teens react to J-POP video.
If you're gonna make another j-pop react video, I suggest you guys to show some johnnys group music. To be safe,  show them the "Japonica Style" MV, since they only lift the media ban for some of johnnys junior group. For the girl group, I recommend to show e-girls. For the co-ed one, just show "LOL" (エルオーエル)
Omg they were so cute! I love Jpop and Jpop stars.. they are so humble and eloquent

Omg !!! PERFUME!!!!!
Please let BTS react
React to 1 ok rock
is this JTS
Their conversation reminds me of anime
The earthquake actually interfered with filming of the PV. They released a version that looped scenes and said that was all we were going to get. Later, perhaps for the DVD release, we got the polar bear scenes. It's hard to know what we would have gotten if there was no earthquake and they just finished the PV as intended, but I'm just happy they went back and finished it instead of just leaving it as a looped version.
im a kpop and jpop fan
You should react AJR and their new album called Neotheater!
Wow...the level of cuteness (especially when they spoke in English)...I don’t remember asking to be attacked 😂😂💜💜🤟
Also, I really appreciate that FBE is featuring foreign music outside of K-pop. This was cool and I also appreciate the Latin music you've been featuring as well.
Please React to Best Live performance of Kpop or Jpop group, and lets see the differences :3
React to Vossi Bop
OH MY GOD PERFUME!!!
Perfume looks like they haven’t aged a bit 🖤

College kids react to Monsta X
Who is Dennis lloyd? People keep spamming the comments with that name....
Excuse me for being slow but I just realized the J-Pop is short for Japanese Pop music aand Korean pop music that's crazy man
J-POP Is the best. I remember when Jpop was on top and Kpop was the after thought... 

The days when we didn't have to deal with toxic K-pop fans on every  social media platform. 😬
love it
Generations react to txt
Wow...the level of cuteness (especially when they spoke in English)...I don’t remember asking to be attacked 😂😂💜💜🤟
You hav to do an ADULTS REACT now, with most of them reacting to perfume xD
KAWAII!!!!
It would be amazing to have a Perfume reaction where college kids or teens react to Perfume (exclusively) although they were in this video I believe there are so many amazing Perfume songs it would be great to have the newer and most popular songs/music videos reacted to and hopefully have them come back 😊
Still hoping for  reaction to  band-maid/band-maiko
Legit watching anime
omg they are so kawaii
react to new j-pop  and j-pop stars react to it
Generations React to Japanese City Pop (Tatsuro Yamashita, Mariya Takeuchi, Anri).
React to Produce 101, Idol School and the winners! It'd be great!

YouTubers react to SMG4
Not as early as I wanted to be but hey another great video🤗👌👍
REACT TO BERD!!!
They've been together 20 years?! That's crazy! I'm curious to know if J-pop groups have the so-called "7-year curse" that many K-pop groups fall to. I know Arashi also lasted 20 years, but I'm not sure how many Japanese groups have that kind of longevity. With K-pop, I can only think of Shinhwa having that kind of continuous longevity.
Hope you all have a great day!
ADULTS react to yungblud please. Specificly loner, psychotic kids and medication please
Awww these teens are now adults, Tom, Tori all of them really. They have all grown up so much
Please react to Stray Kids.
Hi guys how are you
Its nice to see a J-Pop Group, they don't really promote outside of the USA bc Japan is the second leading music industry so they don't really find an interest to come to the USA. Such a cute video.

Gina reminds me of my favorite sci-fi mom character. (The mom of the profit in Supernatural to be exact)
Dude I kid you not the only one that made me cry was Bambi!
394 people don't have a heart😡
If u did not cry or get sad u have no feelings!
This is super sad moms are amazing they are always there for us they will do anything to protect us
When the children were saying happy mother's day it was so sweet🙂🙂🙂
Who is Jennifer the mom of?
Can I rate it a number 10.


Haha 😂😊
I pretty sure I’m the only one not sad or crying (emotional)
I got a book called bambi it made me cry the first time I read it  (I'm 12 , girl )
Am I the only one that’s still heartbroken from finding memo?
I'm not even a mom but dayum I teared up
How old is she 12:29 with all those old kids wowwwwwww=| ÷°
This made me cry to
Is that a youtuber
I only cried cause I never had parents really they left me when I was just 2 . That's All I know
https://youtu.be/WrRvFJXB3nE
My name's is my mom's names Silvia. I'm so grateful for tht
Idk but I just ran to my mom n hugged her so hard has anyone else did that😊
12:30, those kids look older than that mom. Oh my
I failed this and am not even a mother 😭😭
ωну ∂σєѕ тнαт мσм ℓσσк ѕσ уσυиg!?!?!
"You're my lorali to my Rory" that hit me omg
oh boo hoo
😭😭😭😭😭💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️❤️ mom I love you..  te amo mucho mamá
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS LISA'S MOM
I was crying so much after and my mom was like whats wrong
i am so scard when i am adult and my parents die i dont want thme to die :C but it life life is not fair to me some times  comment if u agree
12:43 oh my god those are her kids she look so young that they could be her siblings
Bambi’s mother was fucking dinner🤣🤣🤣
I cried at this one... 10:35
When lisbug showed up I cried
Bambi 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢
Try not to Cry!!







 

Me:WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😢
Me: on the verge of crying but ends up sneezing
who else freaking cried?!?!?
What about the scene from Mamma Mia 2 where Meryl Streep shows up?
8:28 From the heart of my bottom?😂
5:06 I don’t know why but when she cried I cried really hard! She is an extremely great mother 😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'am just 11 and I CRIED SO HARD😭😭
All 5 for me 😭😭
I cried at all of the online clips. I love my mom so much 😭😭💜💜
The first one made me cry -
7:30 it's alright
These shit so funny
OF COURSE I'M GONNA CRY IF YOU PUT THE SAME CLIP OVER AND OVER. THEY HAD TO SEE IT ONE TIME, NOT A MILLION TIMES :'(
you gonna do a father’s day one?
The only video who made me cry was Bambi because I knew her mother wasn’t coming back (different from the 1st video)
How does Kristine look so young?!
Watching this video while at work was not the best idea. Had to wipe my tear every second before a costumer would come in.
6:23 

Normal people: Run!!

A.R.M.Ys: DASHI RUN RUN RUN
i just found out that’s lisbug’s mom... wow
For the second sad video it made me cry but for not what happened but the fact I dont have a mom
The mom in the pink sequins shirt looks like a teenager 😮
Guys that was bday u celebrate my bday yay
Bambi was the only one that made me cry. I was sobbing 😭😭
12:29 They look so much older than her!!!
I hate those people when they say "Omg I'm crying 😢"
Who brung out the onions?
THATS LISBUGS MOM!!!! i love it
I bawled on every video ;-;
Idk what to say in this comment so yeah, silent void
So many onions here...
As a mother this must be the hardest thing ever.
12:40 you look like their sibling girl!!! you look so young  PERIOD
I am not even close to being a mom, but watching the moms cry makes me cry!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😢
I am not a mom not even close but still crying 😢
The military ones don't get me because I have gone through this and my friend had it in worse because she wasn't able to see her father for 7 years and she is 12 or 13.
I'm not crying, YOU are!
I keep wiping my tears away but they keep coming back its useless ugghh
I'm not even a mother and I'm crying.
For the next try not to cry you should put Assassination Classroom the finale where Koro-sensei dies and the role call happens (just a suggestion though)
I cried😥😥 im a mommy myself💙💙💙
I cried seeing the mom’s cry 😪 I’m such a big baby 😩
Roses are red
Violets are violet
Someone's cutting onions
And now I'm crying 😭😭😭😭😭


Edit:I'm not a mom i am a little kid
My message to everyone is that even if you get mad a t your mom they're always going to be in you heart if she is there or not  
Sorry for wasting your time but..... A little quote:what do you do when the only one who can make you stop crying is the one making you cry
Please say happy mothers day!
I cried like a baby😂 oh man I thought I was a hard lad
i may or may not have cried. 😶
This is not sad, I didn't cry in any of them 😐

That was very emotional , can you please react to Louis and Richard bucket list video and Louis' song Two of Us 🙏
"From the heart of my bottom", I love that so much!

Never drink dirty water again. https://youtu.be/pLgajosuBGk
A must watch. Every household should have at least 1.. A global breakthrough.
The second video made me cry and I’m only 11😅😥😢
I was balling my eyes out on the fourth one😂😭😭😭
Thank u for posting this. Im a mom & I have a 17 yrs old son. I really enjoyed this react bc being a mom is really hard but this role made me feel blessed bc I lost one 3 years ago & my son is my only child. Im blessed bc my son was showing me a lot of love, supportive & appreciative. He is my miracle baby & I love him for that & even since when he was in my womb. Thank u FBE❤❤❤ HAPPY BELATED MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL QUEENS OF THE WORLD
Love it! Now do #FathersDay...
Didn’t even realize it was Michelle’s mom until the end part
I was fine until the kids talked to their moms
So I did NOT think the woman with the sequins was a mom of all those grown kids! Loved this video
Lucas in the HOUUUUUUUUUUUSE
Who else started crying 😂🥰😁💓
I tried to watch this on the way to school and started crying on the bus, thanks.
Oh, god I want to hug Lucas' Mom so badly now becasue she doesn't have her own mom with her anymore ;-;
I'd like to see them react to Bill Burr's bit on motherhood.
Land before Time was more sad with the mom dying, than Bambi.
"fighting overseas to protect us". sure thats why they are fighting...not for the oil and all the money that gun industry is making. I should also attack other people to protect me
I cried through this whole video, so heart warming. Hope you guys do a Father's Day edition as well!
Now I think this video is heartwarming, but my mom wasn't a good mom to me. And yes, these moms are wonderful and they care for their kids, but mine didn't. I'm guessing you won't do the same video for fathers day, but if you see this comment, fathers are important too. As for me, my father is much more important than my mother.
Im crying because the moms are crying
RIP Littlefoot's mom :(
I’m sry but honest question am I heartless for not crying >:D ?
Was it just me or did anyone else cry too?
😢😭 I-im n-not crying... THERE IS SOME ONE CUTTING ONION!!  WHO IS IT!!😠😭😭😢
I'm not a mom but I'm crying rn 😭😭 
This is making me miss my mama! Bambi and dumbo make me sob! It's so hard to sit and watch those when you know what it feels like to not be able to see your mom.
Why are you torturing the beautiful mothers who put so much in there childrennn
Dang it! Im not even a mom and I teared up! And it gets worse when I see the mamas cry.
Miss my mother so much,  we lost her on mothers' day two years ago.  Kinda hard each year to say the least.  Nice video to watch though.
I gave birth to my daughter 3 weeks ago so my postpartum hormones are all crazy so after watching this video I'm a blubering mess 😖💓
😭😭😭😭😭🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧
You guy`s made me cry and I'm 8
Not Bambi.. NOT BAMBI
That mother in the pink that has 4 children, she is beautiful. Her reaction made me tear up 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg when Tori's video popped up i legit screamed "ITS TOOOORRRRIIII!!!!" Idk why hahaha
I’m not crying, you are! My eyes are just- watering.
10:26 she loves him SOOOO much, I hope that he always appreciate that
I am literally unable to cry over a video. I feel like I need to but it just doesn’t happen
Who's cutting onions??!
Dumbo's mom holding him through the bars in jail was sad.
omg when the mothers started crying on the individual vids I started crying ;-;
anything sad in a Disney movie makes me cry-
So when is the filming time happen? Morning?
I FUCKING HATE Y'ALL FOR PUTTING IN BAMBI, THAT SHIT MAKES ME CRY EVERYTIME! 😭😭
Yeah, hard without my mother here. In this forest it's really cold. Ofc I screamed and cried when momma deer is not here now :(
I started crying before it even started 😂😭
Please have them do you guys versus girls try not to laugh challenge
FBE Meeting: Any ideas anyone?
Person: Why not make moms cry to celebrate mother's day
FBE Head: YES
I'm not a mom and yet I cried too. I'm only a big sister and an old aunty but feel like a mom at times while taking care of my brother, nieces, and nephews. ..why is there no aunty day?
To the mom with four big kids... damn you still looking good after all those yrs lol
That little boy looks just like his mom
So when Kristine's kids popped up I literally went "wait..WHAT". Girl looks amazing !!!
The only thing that makes me cry is when the wifi goes out....
I had to be away from my daughter for 2.5 weeks once for a brain surgery across the country and it DESTROYED me Kudos to those who serve because in additional to all the other things you do , I could never handle it.
Didn't cry and then 7:33 "...because I don't have my mom with me" FUUUUUCK T_T
the first girl in the personal vid said from the heart of my bottom😂😂
I always cried at bambi when it was a movie, a book, a cd soooooo sad😭😭😭
Bambi always makes me cry
Kristine doesn’t look old enough to have kids that grown.... and I oop
Heres a challenge Idea i just came up with while listening to music. There are two different ways you could do it though.
1. One person listen to a song and they can either tap the rhythem or the words. To make it a bit easier you could have it be multiple choice but the person guessing wouldnt be able to hear the music at all.
2. Similar concept but basically it would just be like the actual song with the beats like a metronome. I dont know if that makes sense but its all i got
Oh wow. A year ago I might have been able to withstand some of these clips, but now with an 11-month old baby I just can't. Everything just goes straight to the heart.
ok its freaking cool how much Jaxon looks like him mom
Kristine surprise me. 4 kids? You look so young, Blessed you
I see those Jojo posters, Jaxon. Ma'am, you raised him right.
You should’ve used a Filipino commercial... hahahaha
Omg wait. What age is the lady in the purple sequin shirt. She looked so young xx
13:15 WAIT WHAT
So this was my first time seeing bambi
Where can I find the second video??
Those Japanese commercial tear jerkers are really emotional jabs. Like the little homeless girl who a man gives money every day once day sees her missing. Or the one with the deaf daughter.
Crying since my mom died when I was young. But smiling because all these videos are cute, adorable and full of love. Great video! 💜
The mom with the pink glitter top looks about the same age as her children dayum
Nooooo Bambi's mom :(
So beautiful
So emotional
the woman in the pink sparkly t-shirt looks SO YOUNG
IM NOT EVEN A MUM AND IM CRYING
JAXON IS A FUCKING JOJO FAN! What a king.
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING
they should've shown the dumbo cartoon one where the mom gets locked up and he carries little dumbo in her trunk and sings her a lullaby

Por fin un challenge k vale la pena compartir😊👌👍
Moms mean a lot to us. They make sacrifices for us just to make us happy. They are our heroes. When we fall sick they take care of us, when we're upset they cheer us up with whatever they can. They work hard for us. They don't worry about themselves and care about our happiness. They've done and will do a lot for us. It's time we do something for them. To make them happy.
i almost cried
I'm not even a mom and i cried the whole video 😭
13:10 is that Lisbug?!?!
some of them really look like their parents like REALLY LOOK LIKE THEM and it's honestly shocking. even with the humor lol
wow this is so sweet
I came here for the Bambi scene, I got what I knew would happen... I cried dammit. Even as a kid when I saw this all the booger’s came out when I wiped my eyes 😂
Loved this! That is the content I'm subscribed for! Could you make the daddies cry for Father's Day? That would be fun and heart-warming :)
I can relate to the first one cause my mom was gone for three weeks it's sad 😔 but she came back safely
I'm not a mom and I'm crying 😭🤣
the saddest scene in a tv show for me is when buffys mom dies in buffy the vampire slayer. makes me cry every time. 😭😭😭
kristine looks sooo young. hard to believe she has grown up kids. 💖
They should have shown that scene from Land Before Time with Little Foot & his mother. It always get to me.
Mother's day poem I wrote 
 creak, creak, creak, creak the rocking chair squeaked. the baby would cry, cry, cry leaving the mother wondering why.

Hearing about life from her child made the mother smile. she hasn't seen such happiness in a awhile. 

the sound of heartbreak c
ame from the teenagers bedroom the love of their life left them behind. the mother consoled her child and told them that everything will be alright. 

A  smile spreaded across the college graduate. the mother was so proud of how far her child has come. she gave them a big hug and said, "the journey has just begun"

The mother laid sickly in her bed thinking about the things she's said and did. the grown up sat next to her singing a sweet sympathy about how she was the reason they reached their dream. 

before the sleeping begun the mother stayed awake for a while to daydream about the golden years with her child.

seeing their mother close her eyes, they kissed her one last time then looks up to the sky, thinking about their younger days and how quickly they flew by.
This is so funny
why the FUCK am i crying, im fucking fifteen
I watched the movie Bambi when I was little and I cried so much I never watched it again.
DUMBO the mom scene when she gets locked up
That scene of Bambi always makes me cry like a horse no matter how many times I watch it.
Actually nada lucas and jaxon is on react :)
Not even a mom yet but I feel this. So beautiful, thanks for posting😊❤️😭
Oh........... so that’s who raised that beach Jaxson

Gina-- Oh, I'm very emotional
Me-- as you sound monotone...
I love this! Can you do the same thing for Father’s day?
When they started crying I started crying😭😭😭

I love you mom
Y’all I wasn’t ready to sob today! As a mum of two I for sure feel all these mums feeling.
Man, I love my mama so much ❤️😭
I love my mom so much. I wouldn’t be who I am today without her
You should have put Mother by Kacey Musgraves. makes me cry SO HARD.
Bruh this video made me cry 3 times idk why 😂😭😭😭
I'm sobbing and it's not a joke. I really need to go and give my mom a hug, she deserves the world
sighs “I'm very emotional..”
If y'all excuse me, I have to go give my mom a hug.
8:28 from the heart of my bottom 😂
Wow i didn't know she was the mother of Lisa Schwartz
I wish I had a mom who cared that much about me 🙃
If you Think Bambi is a heartbreaking story you should watch The land before time. That is the saddest story ever written for a movie
can you guys please do the same challenge for Father’s day
I love my mom 💖💖💖
Lorelei To my Rory Omg that was adorable!








Anyone else know the show, Gilmore Girls?
Crying in the club
The one on the pink sparkly shirt looks SOOOO YOUNG to have kids that are that old 😂😂 I didn’t even expect her to have children and if she did I would’ve thought it would be like a baby lol
I still almost cried when they showed the Bambi clip because it's an inside joke between me and my parents😂
This was amazing💗💗
not a mother. totally cried. I'm okay with that. <3
Heart of my bottom? Umm...
Oh no one of these moms have my own moms name!
I'm not even a mother but I literally cried 😂
Oh man, should’ve shown them the Graveyard of Fireflies
How many mothers watching this cried? 😭
Love my Mom everyday. I tell her everyday I love you Mom.
OMG HAIDNIAMSDJIWNDWOSJNFIWJWNDISKS WHO THE HECK IS THE CUTTING THE ONIONS??? 😭😭😭
one fo the thing that i hate on this kind of videos, is that usually people says that soldiers arre protecting them, but protecting from what? is USA the one who attacks other, not other to USA XD
the woman in blue definitely  gonna have separation issues when he goes of to college
The third clip should’ve been when Little Foot’s mom died in The Land Before Time, that was a tear jerker for me.
My only weakness, crying mothers
Wow...these moms were so inspiring
React to ROMAN HOLIDAY MEMES
i was fine until they showed their kids' videos gosh i'm crying and i wanna hug my mom.
12:30
WHAT ???!! wooooooow man I literally was shook.. she looks so young!  
God bless all mothers and fathers ❤️
Soilders returning alwasy makes me cry!! I also cried when Jaxon showed up idk why xD
12:29 WTF!?!? She looks so young!!! I thought she was going to have a 6 year old to say Happy Mother's Day
I cried on the first video and i'm not even a mom
Seeing other people cry makes me cry
Y'all HAVE to have the dads do this for Father's Day!! I have a feeling that Jason would get super emo❤️
Lucas' mom is so chill compared to her son!😊And yea I failed this challenge terribly when the mothers started watching their kids!!😍😍😍And all these moms are so beautiful!
I love every single one of these mom's! While my own mother begs me to stop watching this every 5 minutes 🙄 These reactors are so lucky to have reach other and blessed to have such heart warming mother's.
I was crying here 🙄
I’m not even a mom and I’m still crying😤😭😂
I find it funny how easily they all cried and how with my mother you`d be more likely to get emotions out of a rock than her
i love jaxon and his moms relationship they are so cute<3
How old is Kristine? Damn vampire?
i love enza, jaxon's mom hahah so great and funny
this year was the first time I could not say how much my mom ment to me, because she died last month. so it was a hard day for me. but still I will say to her ( in a photo) Happy mothers day
This has got to be one of the most beautiful and powerful videos y'all have done. Being a mom is one of the most amazing and the hardest things that as a mother you will ever do and like they said you don't know if you're doing it right you don't know if you're helping your kids but in the long run you just hope and pray that everything you do it's worth it for your kids. The first time your kid says I love you and they know what they're saying, is something you'll never forget.
I'm not even a mom and I was bawling the entire video
Sooooo....Kristine is a vampire.  Lol. Her kids look older than her. This video was beautiful!
I did good until the end, that was really sweet.
It is logical that i cried too?😥🙂🙂❣️
kristine's kids look her age omg
They should do a Try Not to Cry during those Wade Dwayne Budweiser commercials
Moms are precious must protect!! 💕
Holy crap, how can you not cry during any of these?! 😭
12:29 WTF she looks 21!!!
i'm not a mom but i cried(not all videos)
Why am i crying?? I’m not even a mother😭
Kristine looks stunning never knew she had 4 kids an looks so youthful .
Happy Mother's Day to all the beautiful and strong mothers out there! You deserve all the outpouring of love after all the sacrifices that you have made just to give us your kids the best life possible. Special s/o to my Mama in the Philippines! Love you lots, Mama Mayet! <3 
I hope I get a s/o next week because it's gonna be my birthday on the 19th! :D
12:02 she is like OH NO GET AWAY I JUST WANNA SEE MY DAUGHTER lmao
I cried for every single video.Shit.
Can you do Father's try not to cry( Father's day) as well??
Is Kristine a fucking vampire!? Her kids look older than her.
OMGG I didn’t know that was Lisa’s mom!!!!!!! But awww this was such a sweet episode especially the end 😍❤️👏🏽
Wow this is so powerful. A mothers love is something else. It makes me sad for the lady I go to for cosmetics, and my mom's friend. She lost her daughter in a car crash, which isn't easy. Its so heartbreaking because once when she was doing my brows, she started to talk about her daughter. I apologized because I felt for her, and she was like "I love her so much, she was strong, and beautiful." then she started tearing up and crying. I wouldn't ask any mom to have to cope with such thing.
Wow, mothers are so stong and powerful. I can't wait for the day i become a mum, it must ve magical.
The girl in the sequin top looks wayyyyyyy to young to be their mum she’s so pretty
I'm not a mum yet but all of these videos got me crying!!
Ouch :(
I’m crying now. F*ck.
I cry
This is so emotional considering not many many people get love like this. I'm happy to have what I have and Happy Early Mother's Day, everyone! Love what you have!
No like, Land Before Time with Littlefoot's Mom?
This almost made me cry even when am a kid I take care of my mom when she’s sad❤️
My sleeves are soaked with tears! 😭
The last ones got me and I’m not even a mother
Wow! Just...Wow! That was so emotional for me because I love and appreciate my Mom so much. She means so much to me.😁
Ok I officially hate you. Bambi gets me every time.
I'm crying now 😭😭😭. I love my Mom, we are so close I trust my Mom more than anyone I tell her everything and I still hug and kiss her and say I love you even though I'm grown and most kids don't do that
happy mother's day... you wanna cry?
I don't have kids and I'm crying
10:18
How is Kristine the mom to all those people??!?! She looks so young! She looks younger than some of the people on the couch!😱
Bambi was not Sad at all
For the subs team: it's not Spanish but Portuguese at 3:45
I cried and I’m a little boi 😭😭😭😢😢😢
Those moms crying and talking about their kids had me crying harder than any of the videos.
The most interest thing about moms is that they don't know what they're doing most of the time and it's so scary and frustating but we keep going because this small piece of us is still kind and adventurous and curiuos and beautiful and so pure that we can't give up..We just can't.
Those veteran ones don't usually get me, but that little kid running had me tearing up.
This was SO emotional! Shout out to these mothers!
O no
Not Bambi
Lmfao the tissues made me laugh
as a mother myself, every video got me right in the heart. as one of the Moms said, u put so much into to children & it's hard to reassure them even when ur scared for them but it's instinct. Happy Belated Mother's Day to these ladies and viewers out there.
try not to cry viewers edition 😔
im not even close to be a mom and i crieeeed a river
That second video had me crying. Reminded me of my own mother. She has always been there for me. Even when I'm at my darkest point in life.
Yeah, they're protecting us from not having oil
This made me cry 😢😢😢
OMG!! Kristine's children are all adults. How old is she?
What????? Lisa's mom?????!!!!!
11:45 I love that 😭. "You're the Lorelai to my Rory" 😢😢😢
Second one got me
What are u going to do for fathers day?
Im crying cause they’re crying 😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
12:30 was when my jaw dropped. I know it's cliche but if I saw her walking down the street with her kids, I would just assume she is a 5th sibling. And I'm not even sure I would peg her as the oldest sibling :P
How did u not put the polar bear man
Someone can turn this exact video into a try not to cry
13:05 omg I had no idea that was Lisa's mom
I'm not crying. You're crying. Sniff sniff.
Bambi get a 10....
OMG 😭😭
Great episode. React at its best!
I’m not a mom or a girl, but i’m crying right now..
What's wrong with me, why can't I cry😂
My dad is deploying for 9 months😖😢
Military is borring. Lo siento pero eso no hace llorar. Hace llorar Miles de masacres en Colombia por Álvaro Uribe Vélez.
I started to cry when she said on the Bambi one when she said the her mother died
Who could talk about Bambi without mentioning THAT scene? That part ALWAYS gets you, no matter how old you are! R.I.P. Bambi's mom. And that was nice of you to have their children send them a personal Mother's Day message! Especially Lisa. I KNEW you wouldn't leave out a former YouTubers Reactor.
Omg the woman with the glitter shirt  looks so young 😱😱😱
😢So sad
Shoot, why there's rain on my cheek.
Woah the lady with 4 kids I was expecting her to be like 30 with young kids. She looks amazing 😍
Scary part is I'm not even a mom....but this makes me think of my mama. She's everything to me
These aren't even my kids but I'm all up in my room crying myself a river
8:50 made me break down all the way 😭😭
OMGG😭 Im not even a mom, yet still over here crying😩
Thanks for making me cry 😭
Had you put Dumbo's "Baby be Mine" you would have lost me
intense growl BECAUSE I FREAKING LOVE HIMMMMMM ! Haha that was awesome
God dammit! Now I need to go watch a laugh challenge.
That so emotional 😢
Happy Mothers Day ❤
Oh my gawd Bambi... Noooooo....
My defenses are up i did a lot of nervous laughing
I'm on my period so I'm crying even more than usual 😭😭
Carolina I lost my sweet sweet abuelo and it's hard to not cry about it sometimes we just need to
Wait Jennifer is Lisbugs mom, OMG my wig has been seriously snatched, had no idea
Bambi Made me cry a little
Ummmmmmmmm I really think they should have one for Father’s Day it’s not right to just talk about the moms it’s already hard enough that dads don’t get the recognition they deserve
Someone is cutting onions i swear
My mother hated my gift to her...plus she is sick and hates Chilis https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y1iMeJu9CbA
How old is Kristine OMG she looks so young but her children look early 20s
BAMBI NnOOO
Jeannie's mom made me tear up..
Best react video in a loooooong time son
Raise your hands if you cried when the moms cried once all their kids came up.
now i miss my mom.. =(
React to fancy mv
I’m a momma and I would have just failed failed this 😂😭
I'm crying because.. my mom has been absent, well uhh for 20 years now..she left when i was 2..hahahahh i can never relate that's why 😭
This was such a sweet heartfelt video. I wasn't able to spend time with my mom on mother's day sadly. This idea of recording a thank you video to my mom would be a perfect gift for next year.
im balling over here
2:40y moms travels for 1 month comes back telling us how she regrets coming back
I'm pregnant everything is making me cry
10:57 had me friggin balling
Mom is the best
Did Kristine adopt her children? She does not look nearly old enough to have kids that age. If those are her bio kids, she has aged amazingly. I want to know her secret, because I figured she'd have a toddler or something, not grown-up children.
Just admit it. You’re crying like a whale
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE!
This is so precious. ❤️
Aww the second one made me cry cuz I was thinking about losing my mum
BEST MOTHER'S DAY VIDEO EVER !!
REACT TO TWICE - FANCY M/V PLEASEE!!
y’all got me crying at 10 am 
this is not okay
1.l did not cry
2.I kinda cried 
3.I did not cry because I have seen that sene over and over again 
But when they were reacting to there kids I cried a lot not a lot lot but I just cried
Video 1: I Cried, 3 out of 5
Video 2: I Got Teary Eyed, 2 out of 5
Video 3: I Didn't Cry But It Makes Me Super Sad, 4 out of 5
Even though i am a young it made teary-eyed
Wow when jeannies mom came up i didnt even have to read it they look SO much alike
10:57 only sometimes??
Bruh I'm not even a mom let alone a woman and i have tears in MY eyes lol
This makes me so excited to me a mum and feel so blessed for my mum and granma 💜
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING
I wish I had a mother I loved like this. 
My mother is someone you can’t wait to get off the phone to, who’s someone you wouldn’t go and try visit whenever you can, and someone I don’t have a close connect with 

A month ago, I found out I was pregnant and I promised myself and my baby that I was going to be the best mum I could possibly be and give them all that I can in the world. Then I miscarried and Mother’s Day was 1 month after that test turned positive. 

Watching this makes me so sad, but at the same time happy. I still have SO much growing up to do, I’m single and was going to be a single mum (which didn’t bother me. I know I could do it on my own), just in the moment that those 2 lines showed up, I knew I was going to do SO many things differently than how my parents did. 
I want my kids to be able to come to me when they need comfort, because I can’t. 

My mother didn’t even call me to ask how I was going after the miscarriage, and I feel like I can’t be upset around my dad because he always says “shit happens” 😔
This made me cry and I don’t even have kids yet. So beautiful
The second video...
Mums cry at everything ❤️😂
It is moms day let's make them cry for our amusement
Hey mother's day wouldn't exist without kids😂😂HAPPY MOTHER'S MOTHER'S DAY💜
I don't have heart I don't cry of all those videos I don't cry
PD:Sorry for my English
happy mothers day, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16TW0ereUUI
Why is kamala Harris here tho?
When you got Bambi for Christmas 😒 so you don't even care.
The only thing that gets me is that one scene from Coco when Mama Coco remembers her dad
I think the scene from Assassin's Creed III is more emotional than Bambi
You guys had to pick that scene from Bambi! Why?!?! That always make me cry!
I cried so much throughout this video..
I love you mamma❤️❤️😘
I’m not even a mom but I cried through most of the video. I love my mom so much and appreciate everything she does for me . Moms are the best
New here just subbed!
I cried the WHOLE DANG VIDEO 😭! I’m pregnant atm and I’m having a girl ❤️ so I’m extremely emotional!
I did not cry even a bit tho!!😹😹😹😹
Woah woah, HOL’ UP!
Kristine look 20, how tf her kids be all grown up and look like her older siblings. Wtffffffffff!!!!!!
damn you invisible ninjas that cutting onions
Why do people cry when they say that they love them and say thank you? Like it’s not anything special I say that to my mom everyday. Y’all shouldn’t be crying.
wtf?! They don't go back to look at the dead mother in Bambi?!? Never knew that. The polar bear cub finding his mom as a rug cartoon is more sad than that.
Bambie is the only one who made me cry because the mom died. The first two I had zero feeling for.
I dont celebrate mother's day like specifically because to me i want to make my mom safe and happy and appreciated every single day. Seeing this kinf of post like this, regarding mother's day, it makes me sad since she left away. It reminds he how i misses her, a lot.
WHAT???? KRISTINE HAS FOUR GROWN CHILDREN????? She doesn’t look anywhere near old enough!!!!
Jennifer was Lisbug's mom?! I never knew that hahah
I'm crying because of two things. I love my mother SO much. And I have a heavy maternal spirit, so even though I have no kids yet, I feel it because my fiancé and I can't wait.
Should have shown Dumbo instead of Bambi.
this was beautiful! :) I'm not even a mother but I cried ❤❤
Do a Father's day and put in a Simba. Oh my God.
Do this for Father's Day, and include that clip from Armageddon at the end when the daughter had to say goodbye to her dad through the screen of the TV. That always got me!
7:33 made me cry, seeing the pain on her face and in her voice broke my heart..
you should've shown the polar bear one.....tho its messed up for mothers day ...you know nevermind
Im not evin a mom but im crying
Good suprise idea
Not all moms wear capes
Do this for Father's Day, please.
SHOWERS EVERYONE WITH LOVE AND AFFECTION
I wanted to see these moms being surprised by their children showing up as if they were celebrities. Opportunity missed.😔
Edit: 12:00 HA HA!
This is Fred the Turtle 🐢 he cannot swim yet.
Isn't he too adorable for you to let him drown in the comments?✨
I’m not crying YOU’RE CRYING 😭😭😭
The Bambi was so sad
Making mothers cry in mothers day... seems legit
I’m over here, a 14 year old, no where near being a mom, crying my heart out at these videos
Edit: I cried so hard at the messages the daughters sent their moms and the moms reactions :’)
I miss my mom😔💔
If I didn’t have the fear of being pregnant and going through labor I would so want to be a mom.
You guys should have showed the clip from "Land Before Time" where Little Foot's mother dies after fighting the T-Rex! That is a tearjerker lol!
2 1 1 are my rankings
Very nice lady's and children.
I love  my mom!
How could 318 people 👎 this video!!! This is beautiful!
That wrecked me. Ugh. Bawling. But the thing that wrecked me the most is that girl in the pink sparkles. I literally thought she was 15 until I saw her grown kids. Woman, share your fountain of youth with me!!
These moms seems so chill 👌👌

And ahhhh who are cuttting those damn onions??
In no Mum and no Woman and i cry by everyone of them and im Proud about it
Now show the scene where Littlefoot loses his mom!
That Bambi gets me every time!
I'm surprised that Jollibee Mothers Day Commercial isn't here.
4 children at 29??????
Was I the only that noticed right now that UK and USA have different Mother’s Day cuz the UK has it in March
I’m fucking bawling my eyeballs out.... that’s how you know I’m an actual kid ✊🏻🏳️‍🌈❤️
JAXON LIKES JOJO. OKAY THIS KID IS AWESOME.
Watching this just after finishing my makeup was not a good idea
i'm a cry baby. they better not put mufasa's scene in a father's day version of this.
"You're the Lorelei to my Rory" that's so cute❤❤❤❤❤
It should be make moms cry not try not to cry
My mom just died march 25th this is hard I shouldn't have watched this.
Hi. I subscribed. I've always been interested in joining the club as well. I wanna be part of you guys. I wanna be part of the react channel. Let me know when you read this comment. Thank you and God bless. I always pray for all you staff and everyone on this channel hoping you all make more videos bc they're awesome and if love to be there with you all. Thank you
The hardest challenge was on the viewers
That jojo bizarre Adventure at 10:04
You guys need to do the Salisbury Christmas commercial for one of your try not to cry challenges.  I ball when I see that no matter what!!!
It's no wonder Jaxon is so awesome. His mom seems really neat.
JEANNIE STRAIGHT UP GOT HER LOOKS FROM HER MOM
Omg I didn’t know that was Lisa’s mom!!!
There must be onions nearby...
I cried instantly lmao fuck
Dad's try not to cry for Father's Day
This video made me cry for sure.
Every mom lost at the first round.  LOL!  Happy Mother's Day!
Damn my eyes now teary, and im a grown adult dude
Great video FBE & Moms! 👍
React to impractical jokers please.
We definitely need one for father's day
I’m bawling 😭
12:28 
So... Anyone else realizes that her children look older than her or it's just me?
I'm shook by how many kids Kirstine has had and how grown all her kids are 😱
I couldnt spend Mothers Day this year with my mom and this video had me crying all over the place!!! 😭😭😭
The second one though
Wow Kristen has 4 kids HOW
Wait what?! How is Kristine a mom? She looks like she should be on teens react!  
Awesome video...I lost the challenge!!
Happy Mother's day everyone!!
Aw the video was so sweet. But was anyone else shocked that that lady has kids that big !12:28 She looks really young/good.
They should've done the scene in Dumbo with his mom after they're separated! That scene makes me cry almost every time I've watched it since I was little.
I miss my mom. RIP mom 😔😔
I wish i had my mom:(
my eyes only got watery because I wish my mom loved me like they love their kid
I need to go to College rn but here I am, crying , bawling infact over this video.. 😓😓
They should do the lion king scene for Father’s Day
Ironically, they only show thankfully to mothers for every years. They could do that for everyday but they didn’t, which is sad
Wow
Poor crying moms. So cute.
Did I just see Shane Dawson’s ex Lisa? She is one of my favorites in elders react and I had no idea she was Lisa’s mom, that is SO fantastic!!
Short clip 1: no emotion
Short clip 2: no emotion
Bambi: bawls
I only get emotional when i yawn
10:24 I want a kid so bad so I can feel like this
I am an emotional mess
Bambi is one of my saddest moments I've ever seen.
Dang it I’m crying and I don’t even have children😭 HAPPY MOTHERS DAY for all you hard working moms your our rock that’s always there😍❤️😍
what a cute video
God dammit, I cried a lot
Maybe when I’m a mom these will get to me. Idk though
it so cool to seen their moms <3
I didn’t see my mom for 1 year when I was 10 it was so hard 😭😭💔
Wow she has kids that are adults and she still looks that good? What is her secret?
I cried every single second of this video i love itt❤️❤️❤️
Why is Bambi a boy Bambi is a girl name not a boy name
am i the only one that cried in every single video?
I didn't cry until the personalized videos. I thought I'd made it through, but I was so very wrong.
Bro I would be the worst parent ever I laughed so fucking hard idek why
Kristine needs to give me the recipe of that Collagen she's taking, seriously. I'm still surprised. :O
7:28
I’m so sorry. 😪
This HAS TO BE one of the best videos that you guys have ever produced because I connect and love my mom so much that this reminded me of how strong she is and how much she has gone through for my sisters and I. But what really got me crying was when Jeannie’s mom saw the video of her WITH THAT MONTAGE UGH
Had to skip the Bambi one... I was out and about and didn’t want to cry
Omg I'm cry
12:30 WOW, I thought she was 28. BAM! That woman looks soooo young, :O . BRAVO!, and LOVED the video!💛⚘🇵🇷
HEY I AM FROM AFGHANISTAN RUDE!!!
"I FREAKING LOVE HIM" omg shes precious
i cried for a whole 15 minutes and 46 seconds
Waaaaaiiiiiiit a minute here!  Kristine is a mom to grown kids?!  She's their MOM?!  How is that possible?!  She's not old enough to be their mother!  I thought she was part of the "Young Adults React" - how does she look so  young??

Zach Galifianakis
"do you have a mom. Me neither"
No dumbo and mom scene? You should have put that one in there. Its a real tear jerker.
No Coco? You are getting soft
Pink sparkly top girl has 4 grown children?! Wow! She looks so young!
This should just be a channel (moms react)
I teared up in the first few videos but cried at the end
wow thanks for making me cry:)
Not including the ending scene from the episode of Futurama where Fry gets to talk to his mom in her dream is a bit of a slap in the face. You had your chance, FBE. Come on now.
Yall really out here making moms cry on mothers day. Shame 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀❤
I love this so so much
I was crying
Best episode ever!
And they had to put Bambi (wen I was like 9yrs old I couldn’t watch this movie cus I would cry a lot 👏)
I think I'll call my mom. I just did, but I really wanna tell her that I love her.
Wow that mom must have had her kids really early in life I bet she’s great at it 💕
12:30 that has to be the youngest mom ever
Im not not a mom technically but when Bambi 's mom

“The heart of my bottom.”
Where the onions at?

This is my 11th mother’s day without my mom, it still stings a little that she’s not here. If this day is hard for you for whatever reason, I hope you find some small reason to celebrate and smile today. Happy mother’s day to all of you out there filling the momma role with love and care, you are appreciated ❤️  
P.S this video was so heartsome

Kristine looks soooo young I had to re watch that part I couldn’t believe she has 4 grown kids she looooks so good those are goals 😂😂👏🏼👏🏼

How old is the woman at 12:50?? She’s so youthful for four kids. She looks like she’s 20 something!

Im young and i cried at the end because my mom doesnt eprisiate what i do for her..But i love her ..
I rate it a zero for all of them tbh. The first two made me happy, the last one I’ve seen too many times.
Must be harder for the mom? 🤔😑🙄
YES , I wasn’t expecting this, arigato (thank you) what a wonderful surprise this is brilliant 😊
I’m not even I freaking mom and I’m balling my eyes out

Bambi made me cry
This is the first Try-Not-To Cry video where I actually had tears rolling down my face. The first two videos were emotional because I could just relate them to what my mom has done for me. I cried when I wrote in her Mother's Day card this year and she cried when she read it. My mom is my rock. We always have each other's back. The surprise videos at the end and the mom's reactions to their children got me good too. I promise it's happy tears. Thank you FBE <3
Wish my mom did all of this for me.

I didn’t cry 😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
From the heart of my bottom 👏🏻
Wait...Kristine has 4 grown kids???
Kristine in the pink sequins has a rocking hot bod. Damn she looks incredible for having all those kids. I have four but feel like I look like a slob. All the mom’s look beautiful.
I lost this challenge,it was so sweet 😭
Im just glad they understand that what they mean by “emotionall because the kids or regular teens/young adults always go “well it wasnt sad it was happy!” Like they dont know what “emotion” means, it can be very emotional and still uplifting glad they understand
I'm not even a mom and I cried.

My mom doesn’t like stuff all she wanted was peace and quiet from me and I give It to her and I gave her a kiss and a hug and said happy mother’s day i went out to dinner with my mom and dad and grandma!
Bambiiii 😭😭😭
When the mom talked about how she doesn’t have her mom with her anymore is what got me
These moms seem amazing. My mom didn't come on Mothers Day even though I picked her flowers for a gift, in fact- She didn't raise me. My Grandma did which is more like a mother, but my birth mom visits sometimes! Just not often and didn't on Mothers Day. I wish she did at least for her gift, you know? But this was really sweet and the mothers in here seem great. You guys are cool. Happy mothers day to the amazing, sweet, soft yet brave moms out there. <3
Am not a mum yet but I literally wept.love u moms everywhere. U are hero's
This was a beautiful episode , I love tori , she’s so sweet and genuine and funny , wow so many feelings , this channel is the best , so glad I found it 🥰 happy Mother’s Day to all the moms reading this 💝❤️👩‍👧‍👦

Love my dad! <3
My mum would never cry infront of me. :']
Try not to get mad - gamers - diablo immortal?
The first 2 made me barely turn up but bambi is a different story

This episode hits hard for someone who is working alone overseas, I miss my mom :(
I was shocked at how grown up Kristine's kids are! She looks so young!
No woman no cry 😢
Those moms reactions made me cry more than the videos.
The US soldiers are more like they are distributing "freedom" rather than protecting the US.

As a single mum, it’s never easy knowing that you are doing the right thing. I just hope my two grow up to be the best versions of themselves as they can be and knowing I have a part in that, is the greatest honour, I can ever have!
Loved this video so very much, you guys had me in tears. 😥
Jaxon's mom tho hahahhaha I love her. I love any video that has the both of the together. They're SO FUNNY.
Cant wait till they do this for fathers day. Oh wait....

The greatest love will be Jesus love. He loves unconditionally. He is the only reason we even know what love is.Their is no end to it, it just keeps going. Call out to him whenever in trouble.
I totally thought the little girl was watching the tornado and when her mom looked back at her, I thought that the next scene would be her getting sucked up into the tornado and that would correlate with her flipping since she was a gymnast......
Uuugh im very emotional 😐

If I was there, I would probably be the only one laughing....  but If you want me to cry, put the Mamas awards on.  Yea, I’d cry.  I’d cry when Jin gets enlisted.  Yea, I’ll cry.  I’ll cry when I think about the fact thatI will never meet my idols, yea I’ll cry.  I’ll cry if there’s something personal going on, Yea I’ll cry.  Yea, yea I will.  But other than that.  I won’t.
Who else cried also?😭💞

Why I'm emotional than this all moms

2:47 No one is fighting for your country. They are invading another country for oil and profits that you are not getting. Bush sent the U.S. Army to protect his pipeline and left the people to pay for the bill. Stop wasting your money on the military complex and start spending it on the people for the people.
Bruh I was cryin cause 1 I can’t live without my mom and 2 my 2vyear old daughter is next to me and just is my world 😭💛 I can’t!! 💕

As someone who grew up without my mom and still currently lives far away from her this made me cry so much and made me wish I was with my mom, I miss her so much, I needed her and I still do. Happy mothers day to my mom and to every mom out there!
I wish I could have told my mother these things today and that definitely made me cry <3 



I miss you so much Mom <3 It has been 5 years and I still miss you so much, rest in peace <3

I call my mom motherlyn. Am I normal?
My big brother went overseas and I hope he is going to be ok.
Hold the hell up... How old is Kristine? She has four kids, older kids? She looks like their sister, and not even like the eldest sibling. I sincerely thought she had young kids. Wow that woman has some amazing genes! She and her entire family are beautiful ❤️
I didn't cry or have watery eyes...where are my emotions
12:30 I’m shocked 😱, she looks so young I can’t believe that she has 4 children, no way
reading the comments and i just... am i the only one that didnt know jennifer was lisa's mom?


but that explains why jennifer looked so familiar tbh, lisa is a spitting image of her
I lost my mama to overdose, I was only eight but I will never forget a second of that morning. I woke up, but my mom didn't. I was with my three siblings and I couldn't get ahold of my dad who was at work. Waited for hours for anybody to help. I'm not looking for any sympathy, I just want everyone to know that your mother is amazing. Enjoy her, cherish her, be there for her. She took care of you. You don't know how long you have.
8:28 heart of my bottom?
IM NOT EVEN A MOTHER AND I AM CRYING AT EVERY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
Watching this video warms my heart
10:38 especially since you birthed that awesome child
I don't even know them but I'm crying right here😭
I see moms crying... I cry.
I made my mum cry on mothers day. Sent her Tori Kelly's "Always love you" to her social media and she started tearing up while watching it. Probably she's just not used to me being sentimental ^.^
I ain’t even a mother and I’m bawling so hard rn 😭😭😭❤️❤️
You should have showed them the Dumbo scene! 🐘 😭
7:34 your mom is with you. I’m so sorry.
This is so sweet if you can hug your mom right now hug her
Omg Kristine looks so young to have all those adult children. Amazing!!
What's with that mom in pink who looks younger than her FOUR kids?!

All moms are priceless ❤
WHY TF AM I CRYING? IM NOT EVEN A MOM
Awwwwww me heart!
Guess who cried on every video.... this guy yay I love tears :(
It's funny and incredibly sweet that they burst into tears at the sight of kids they've been looking at for years. "OMG I LOVE HIM!" Just the sweetest!!!!! lol
Thank you for every mother you are the love of you children's lives. Thank you for caring, loving, and hugging. Happy mother's day we love you.

Five minutes in and I have to stop and watch this later. I'm at work rn and don't want people wondering why I'm all red eyed 😂
You know, to be honest, Jaxon's mom looks a bit like Reese Witherspoon to me..just saying..
You’re the Lorelei to my Rory. OMG I LOVE THAT SHOWWW, I’m watching it with my mom <3
I bawled man!!!!!

Ok so far father's day, do "dad's react" and show lion king.

Literally in tears through this whole thing. I love my mom so much. I literally have no idea what I would do without her
8:26 from the heart of my bottom
Wait

“From the heart of my bottom” 😂😂😂
I cried so hard on the second video they reacted to!
:'(
Happy mothers day!
The mom in the glitter shirt is old enough to be my mom I’m 32!!.. and she still looks younger then me!!!! 😂😂😍😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗💯💯💯
WHY BAMBI? F UUUUUUU OH NOOOOOOOOOO
I need to watch Bambi! Happy Mother’s Day to all the mommies 🥂🥂🥂
she's Lily's mum?!?!?!?!?! I didn't know thhhaaaattt
Bro at 12:29 she looks younger then her kids!! HOW?!?!?
Why am I crying 
I just love my birth giver so much she gave me life 😍
To all the anti hunters. Let me remind you all deer are grown by the time hunting season starts. Plus in some places in the U.S are overpopulated with deer: plus a lot of you don’t know they let people who are below poverty level to hunt so they can eat.
7:32 made me cry when she said that 😭
Sweet video. No way that mom in the pink sequins shirt had all those kids, they look her age! What’s her youthful secret??? lol
WHY AM I BAWLING
I think the reactions of the moms where more touching than the video clips
NOT BAMBI 😭😭😭😭
I’m a 14 year old boy and a cried for the movie
i started crying at that 1st didnt stop
This was the best one that I have seen thus far, 😢😢😂
Man, you guys were vicious on this one, 😁😂😁, great job, 👍👍😁
Hope everyone had a wonderful Mother's Day,  have a great week, ☺😀☺
Y'all are so lucky to have such good relationships with your moms. Enjoy your special day with your special person.
10:16 is that a JOJO POSTER
How is Kristine mom of those adult looking boys? How? She looks sooo young! I need explanation
adults react to josh a and iamjakehill?
This made me cry and I am not a mom I am a 14 year old
I don’t know about anyone else: But did anybody else go OH THATS WHOSE MOM YOU ARE. When the kids videos popped up! I was like dayumm related for sure lol
i'm 18 and i cried like a baby
My mom cried at a quote today that said

”To the world, moms are nothing. But to family, mom is the world”
i wish i have a mom and dad
It 2
there tears of joy fuel me
Hello
Well shit, I lost.
it chapter 2 reaction plz 
Great vid
I wanted to cry
Ugh I love love love this video😭😭😭💛!!! Happy Mother’s Day to all the beautiful and wonderful mommy’s out there!! Also, I died when they said my name!😂 (Lorelei)!
The last video, I can’t stand the thought of not having my mom around, even though I know one day she won’t be around.
I call my mom so much it’s crazy but she’s like my best friend!
The mom in the sparkly shirt 👚 looks so young
F*ck US soldiers, not sad
12:30 How old is she.... her child's look 2x older then her
I’m not a mom, just a daughter but I believe that Mother’s Day is kinda like thanksgiving a whole day where you thank your mom for her love, for her caring for you a way to show her how much you appreciate her even though you don’t look like you show it but deep down you care so much for her and will do anything to see her smile and laugh
NO I'M CRYING THE WHOLE VIDEO😭😭😭😭😭
I am so grateful for my mum. I love her so so much. She is my universe, my moon and my stars. She lights the way and always stands by me. Thank you.
Dang I'm in tears over here. My mom was deported almost a year ago now and I miss her every single day thinking about how hard it must be to be in another country without a single family member all alone without her kids. I can't wait to finally go see her this summer after so long 😭
Looking back, this made me cry due to the fact that my mom calls me each day on the same time just to check up on me since I live across the country from where they live.
Holy crap how young does Kristine look? To have four grown kids? That’s amazing
Not a mom but I lost mine at 16. Still hurts but I will always love her she was the Queen of my life.
Happy mother's day to all mothers any place in the world! All of you!
😭
This makes me so grateful for my mom 😭♥️
I didn't even cry, I feel so heartless
Im not a mom and I cried.
HELP MARIAH CAREY
Everyone Else: From The Bottom Of My heart

Asia: From The Heart Of My Bottom
BUT CRYING MOMS MADE ME CRY askjfh
I hav3 a cousin who has lost their mom after mother's day and I felt sad, since their dad died when they were young, at night I would realize that I'm so lucky to have parents...
Was this a try not to cry for the moms or the watchers😭😭
Adults react to youtube rewind but it’s actually good
Okay but the way jaxons mom reacted😭

I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO PLAY THIS CHALLENGE
wowow I want my mum rn
I cried thinking about my mom and now I need to hug her
I feel like the person talking to the reactor doesn’t have emotions ? I mean like 😂
The Bambi one got me bc I know the feeling of loosing my mom at a young age I miss her so much Happy Mother’s Day from mine to yours 💐💜
FUCK THE PEOPLE WHO DIDNT LIKE THIS MY HEART IS SO HAPPY RN 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am an emotional person. I always cry in these kind of videos. I love my mom so much. She’s my first best friend and she will be my forever.
Thats really makes me happy, well because my mom isn't what u expect as a "mom" because when I was a baby she couldn't take care of me and dropped me off at my dads place and just left....she also did it to my other brother and u might be think "other brother?" Well....i have 4 other siblings from all of different dads and all went to prison for lots of different reason...only my dad didn't..well my mom abandoned me and my brother Calvin. She just trying to learn how to work and just live a happy life... I dont blame my mom for what she did I just think she was trying to do the best for us. I really hope she finds herself and find a new place for a man in her heart that was broken by many men....I love u mom <3
OMG!
This is going to be interesting!
...And they are bringing out the big guns right at the start! T.T
...And then there is BAMBI!
That is not fair!
...Almost as not fair as the LAST videos you showed them!

That stuff is personal!
ALL THE TRY NOT TO CRY CHALLENGES AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT GOT ME
OMG I cried but I want to say happy mother's day
I cried in the entire video!! 🥺🥺🥺
Question: Why does a male European deer have a female Korean name?
My mom cried at a quote today that said

”To the world, moms are nothing. But to family, mom is the world”

I love Enza so much. I wish she properly worked for React so she could be in more content. She's amazing!
Bambi was a low blow.
Thanks for putting animals in this video. They are mothers, fathers and babies too.
My mom left me for drinking. 🙃
Namjoon stop cutting the damn onions 😭
Me watching this: 😂😐👀
Lisa’s message hit me hard😭💕
Aww

10:24 when you tell your friends about your crush

Literally started crying before i clicked the video :_:
Wait.... she’s Lisa’s mum?! 
OMG I can see it now!
At 11:45 when Tori referenced Gilmore Girls I knew she was my favorite reactor 💯

Generations react to Jimi Hendrix
I always hated Mother’s Day, because my mom does so much for me yet on Mother’s Day, i always feel guilty because i am broke as fuck, the best i can do is send her a Mother’s Day card, or a Chocolate or flowers, This day, I treated her to a movie she liked, I wonder if that’s enough?
I cried the complete 15 min.
the last videos all made me cry;;-;;
I
The onions are strong today
I thought the personal videos were sweet. Hopefully you do the same for Father's Day though...
Jealous... I'm jealous...
I'm not even a mom and I'm crying
Not mothers day
Kid: Hi mom
Mom: Hi son/daughter

Mothers day
Kid: Hi mim
Mom: AHHHHHHHHHHH 
I’d do anything for my parents. I treated my mom out today and took her to the casino and out for dinner.
I can’t wait to be a mom 😭😭
In honor of Mother’s Day I have a Disney fact that’ll make you weep.
  Some of the early Disney movies such as Bambi often have the main protagonist whose mother has died which was inspired by Walt Disney who also lost his mother when he was young.
i have no mom
I cried seeing the moms cry lol
To all the mothers that see this HAPPY MOTHERS DAY
Ah Bambi, back when Disney wasn't afraid to be real.
This was so sweet and sad!
Using Bambi is a cop out.
I cried and I'm not even a mom
The last video I was crying I couldn’t  even tell the moms were crying with all the tears in my eyes
aw
Joyner Lucas devils work
I have no soul, so BRING IT ON!!


Yep still no soul.

Happy Mothers Day!! 💕
If that showed tho to anyone who wasn’t a mom they probably wouldn’t have cried
I'm not crying, you are...
I love my mom so much. Couldn’t have asked for anyone better.  Damn it why am I crying so much. This was so emotional
The Bambi one came the closest to making me cry.
Even though I am a 14 year old single male, I already know I will never abandon my new family, it would be hard enough for my wife to give birth, love u 3000 mom
Best way to describe a mother’s love .
This made me cry because my mom isn’t with me anymore, she passed away when I was 11. I saw her grave today and broke down crying. I wish she could see me graduate, get married, and have kids. It’s really hard watching this because I miss her so much😪 everyone at school said “wish your mom a happy Mother’s Day!” I wish I could see her in person, and give her a hug so she knows how much I love and appreciate her for being such a great mom. Bless all of these moms hearts💕
Bro this one has me in my feels
Omg... I cried my eyes out...
12:29 i was suprized of how young the mom looks and how old her kids are ...reminds me of my mom lol
okay why am i crying in the club lol
Did anybody realize that Shane Dowsons girlfriend was a kid in that
Frontline e Bromley in Oakland money and the Harlot in Oklahoma can Nicole National Rental Car on the internet and the comic online from the world someday
I don’t think it’s fair how we have to watch the scene multiple times lol. I shed a few
I love this! This year is my first mother's day, and I cried more than my baby while watching this 😭
I'm a 22 year old man and i can't lie, I broke a few tears to this
I’m crying as a daughter, to listen all of these moms is like hearing my mom
Since they had Bambi they should’ve thrown in Lion King too
The 2nd video always makes me cry. Sending lots of love to all the moms out there.  Happy Mothers Day
I'm crying this was beatiful.
Bambi? Oh d e a r
I was born on mothers' day
Until the end of the video I remembered it was a challenge.
Bro I’m 17 with no kids still crying

As someone who grew up without a mom Happy Mother’s Day Dad
Who is chopping onions in here omg
Is anyone else crying not because they love their mom, but because they feel guilty that they can't because they don't feel that love from them first? I've always envied those relationships I see around me and watching this video made me so sad that I couldn't relate.
It’s so mean how they play all those super emotional videos and then shock them with the videos their kids made
Ew
Cute
Mexican moms: this your first day?
I'm not a mom but I cried the entire time lol
So sweet😊😙😜
When a prideful person tries not to cry but, starts crying a lot a lot in the end.
Teens react to AJR

Bambi and The Lion King both always make me cry.

HAPPY MOTHERS DAY😍😍😻
HAPPY MOTHERS DAY TO ALL THE MOMS OUT THERE
Happy Mother's Day, Everyone!
Generations lyric break down of the Cat's in the Cradle by Harry Chapin
Okay I was already crying but when Lizas video came up I started balling 😭 anyways how old is the mom with the pink glitter shirt cause all her kids look like her siblings.
I love Jaxon and his mom, please adopt me
Mother's day and you make them cry good job lol
at the end they should have had there kids come out and surprise them
Please do teens react to Udy like if u agree
Do any of you react cast members check on Lia Johnson?  I am legitimately worried for her.  I happened to be on Instagram when she did a live video and it really scared me.  She definitely needs some help.
It's the moms reaction that's getting me
A mother is God in the eyes of a child
Thank you FBE... From a 60yo man this is one of the best videos I have ever viewed!!!!
I live very far away from my mom and this video made my cry like a baby.
Father's day and sibling day good luck with the next video
I really like the fact that you’re doing a lot more videos with relatives of other reactors these days. It makes it feel like a much more integrated community.
Can u do try not to cry kkids edition plsss
Man those onions i cut up a couple hours ago are making me tear up
I personally think Baby of mine is a more touching mother-son Disney moment
stop, Jax’s moms reaction was so cute
“It’s not even bc it’s emotional I just freaking love him!!” ME TO MY CHILD LMFAO
3, 1, 2
Omg Jeannie's was so genuine!
I'm 18 and a boy, but I'm feeling just like a mom watching this
i want to be friends with Jaxon’s mom.
Thanks guys for the video, that remind me to always say how grateful I am to have an amazing mom as I do, and I couldn’t stop crying , this is the sweetest video ever .. thank you 🙏🏽 ♥️♥️♥️ happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing mothers out there
let's just wait for the dad's

You should have included little foot from the land before time

Damn loosing my mother 4 years ago and watching this today is not ok. :(
I’m a fucking wreck 😭
The kids saying happy Mother’s Day to the mom is so sweet

The First One Made Me Tear Up
Ugh why show Bambi

12:00 BAHAHAH SHE SAID “Oh nooo cayden”as she waves him off HAHAHA
Mom.. I love you 3000 ❤️❤️
Ugh y'all have me in tears over here and that's not cool lol. Good job FBE!
As the profit Mohamed said 
"Heaven is beneath the feet of mothers " 
Meaning that it can not be compared to what mothers would do for their children
why was i crying along w the moms at the end? like dang i’m so fricking emotional😂
Even when your not a mother you still cry cause we all sure love our mother sooo much!❤❤❤❤❤
FrOm My HeArT oF mY BotTom
This year on Mother's Day, I set an alarm the night before for 6:15 am. When I got up, I made pancakes and served them to her in bed, along with a tiny vase with little flowers in it and a homemade card on the tray. She loved it and was so surprised! Love you, Mommy!
Happy Mother’s Day to all the react and fbe family
Make teens play jurassic evolution
"Ugh...i'm very emotional"

Instant connection with gina
This eid al fitr gonna be so much tears for me ..
Y’all better do a Father’s Day video
the Bambi one is the worst for me. I’m not a mom, I’m still the baby (I’m 16 but still). I’d still be the Bambi who lost him mom, so that one gets me. Idk if I’ll ever watch the beginning of that movie again.
Wow in middle of the sadness I get a fricken car commercial interrupted
Ok
This is pretty wholesome
Why am I crying 😭😭😭
I love you mom💜
12:32 like what is her secret? I’m not even in highschool but I’m just shocked I thought she was like 24 but like wow!!
I cant believe that the elder woman was lisbugs mom!!!!!
This made me miss my mom :'(
First off; Kristine girl, you have 4 grown kids? What's your secret, looking young as ever lol. Anyways, I teared when the mom's started crying over their kids messages lol. Also, I did not know that Jennifer was Lisa's mom, shock of the day to see her pop up lol.
Thank you moms for every thing you do
I’m 18 years old and I have tears in my eyes.
Bambi? Really? You want to get those tears flowing you put on Land Before Time!
Women cry over everything
I literally have a frame with a signature on the back (gifted to me from my mom) saying "to, Rori love, Lorelai" 😭
I didn’t know that was lisa’s mom what!!! so cute
I'm not a mom but I'm crying T_T
Aww the thing that almost got me was when they got there vids from their kids
I’m sobbing omg.
Happy Mother's Day to all mom's. Fucking onions everywhere
This was so sweet 😊
i haven’t watched it yet and i’m crying
I am not even a mom but i still cried.
I'd love to see the one for father's day
Happy mothers day
I was teary eyed but then she said heart of my bottom!!!! Now I am crying because I m emotional and because of the the joke.
I cried like a little girl and Im not even a mom
Endgame is quaking! This made me tear up so much!
Should've added Baby Mine from Dumbo. That was a touching scene as well.
happy mothers day
!!!
omg this is so sad
OMG THAT WOMANS LISBUGS MOMMMMM
I started crying cuz the moms were crying 😂😂 not even bc of the videos
Who the fuck is chopping onions!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!??????😭
To all the mothers happy mothers day!
bambi got me
12:30 

Me:THATS A MOM!?
Not gonna lie I’m thicc
i'm not even a mother but i cry in all videos lol ♡
The last one made me cry too aw!! 😭
Near the end, with the women who had four ppl in the video (idk of they are all her children) looks so young to be a mother! Can I be her in 20 years plz!
why am I crying this much 😭😭😭
This made me cry 😭😭😭
12:28 had me shooked!
My mom is fading away, due to dementia or Alzheimer's, so this hit me hard. And I forgot to wish her happy mother's day, as well. (I never remember when it's coming.) I didn't cry, but I came close, especially when the reactors started crying, that was when it got more difficult. I get emotional, when I see other people get emotional, so even though I technically didn't cry, I definitely lost this challenge. 

Edit: Thanks for all the likes, folks, I don't think I've ever gotten so many on a comment of mine. 👍😊
Already celebrated mothers day on April but HAPPY MOTHERS DAY
My mom lives in Jamaica and I live in the U.S and I only get to see her once every 2 years
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Bambi always makes me cry
They should make a video on kids react to their Mom's reaction on  their mother day's video.
12:30 wow that mother looks as young as her children
I’m not even a mom but these videos has me bawling.
Im a teen and i cried more than the mom's did 😭
I shouldn't be crying this hard
pleasee!! can you react to catriona gray miss universe performance for my mom
The second and first video gave me tears beyond compare 😭💞
fRoM tHe hEarT oF mY bOtToM
It's weird seeing people do comfortable with their parent. Wish I wasn't so awkward to love mine properly. I didn't even tell mine happy mother's day although I seen her a few times during the day because it was uncomfortable to just say anything and texting it felt weird too. I suck ):
im not crying!!!! 😭😭😭
Awwww😭❤️
happy mother’s day to all the mothers, to all the mothers who have lost children, those who have lost mothers, those with strained mother relationships, mothers with strained child relationships, those who have chosen not to be mothers, and those who are yearning to be mothers out there. you are all so strong for giving up everything.
I just cried for bambi 😭😭😭
jaxon's love for his mother makes my heart cry
I broke a little when tori said “you’re the Lorelei to my Rori”
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY!! This is the  sweetest video ever!
Obviously the Very end one got them the Most
Sis I’m 11 and I’m crying about this. Lol 😆
I got here from the kids react to what my kid will do to this and then I said “Ok this must be new so like minutes or hours ago lol”
13:05 yep that what i expected
Dang I dont even know my mom... I’m adopted
I’m crying
Never cry on any of these cuz I don't have a mom. Show one with a little girl living without her mom, then you'll get me ta cry.
You should of put baby mine from dumbo
Shoot, I’m going to cry when I see my son after three days... I can’t even imagine.
That second one got me pretty good.
If I was a mom I would cry my heart out cuz I wouldn't have a mom to say I love you face to face
From the Heart of My Bottom...
When you’re crying but not because you’re happy but because you have a bad relationship with your mom or your parents in general
my mom passed away when i was 2
Why didtn you put baby mine ? They all would have cried
I praise every mother in the world for giving up everything to raise a new born !!! Thank you so much !!!
The bambe is the one that made me cry cuz my mom died when I was 9 and he's 5
the fact that I’m emotional and my hormones are through the roof sent me sobbing by the second vid
I’m not even a mother yet I cried when the moms got the videos from their kids
You know guys, now you have to do this for Father's Day.
Why  i cry tooo match?!!
I always cry to Bambi and it’s just so sad because he lost his mom without even understanding 😞
I know I never tell you this and I don’t think I could ever but I love you mom ❤️
Enza happy mothers day for making the cutest boy ever
Girl- You look ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!- 4 KIDSS?? AND YOU LOOK FANTASTIC! AND YOU'RE SO YOUNG LOOKING TOO??? I WOULD'VE NEVER GUESSED YOU HAD ONE KID! YOU SLAY KWEEN!
Im not even a mom and im crying 🥺😓
React to Matt Corby!!!
In my country is not Mother's day but after i saw this video i tooked the phone n called my mom. <3
Just glad they didn’t do baby mine from the original Dumbo. That messes me up every time!
I started crying for like a minute....
I'm not a Mom but i'm crying with them 😢❤️
#girlpower
Wait why am I crying.
8:10 Omg that emotion change lmao
I cried along with them and I’m not a mom
You should put that Dumbo scene 😢
Should of shown baby mine from the original dumbo movie. There would of not been a dry eye in that room. Makes me cry all the time.
I love how none of the mothers actually sobbed at the Bambie one but I did haha
i literally cried during all these omg 😢.
Why you guys gotta do this to me! I love my mom so much!!😭❤️
HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY EVERYONE IN 2019!!!! I hope you guys got something for your mother to make them happy. Enjoy!
Who put these onions here?
Now bring the kids in to do a try not to cry with this video. Watching their mom cry and talk about them would make someone emotional!
Dumbo is more sad
Oh man the invisible ninjas are back with their swords and onions..
I wish daughters were apart of this video. I knew if I was watching all these I would cryyyyyyt
i only cried in the bambi one dont judge me
happy mothers day💕😢🤱🏽👩‍👧
Today I wished my mom happy Mother’s Day and tried to hug her but she yelled at me and told me to do my chores and make dinner lol 
I love my mom ❤️
It's always Disney 😭
I was waiting for the polar bear one.
aw Lisa!
7:32
Aww, bless her heart. I feel so bad for her! 😭 😭 ❤️
the first two reactions of their kids videos made me cry
I’m not a mother but I’m a daughter and I cried so hard. My mom is my best friend and our relationship has been a little rocky lately for the first time ever but this just enforced that doesn’t matter but she always will and I don’t want to take any time with her for granted being mad at something so small.
Such a cute and wholesome video. Definitely a pleasant change of pace with how chaotic the world can be.
I only cried for the bambi video cause lucas's mom started crying😢
Happy mothers day mum ..I miss you - we are 100000000000 miles away..probably the 20th mothers day we don't spend together... u know I love you sooo much....Miss u mum...
I DIDNT KNOW SHE WAD LISA'S MOM
I thought the girl in the pink sparkle shirt was like 25 but then she had full grown children and I was like what?!
I’m not even a mom yet and I sobbed through this whole video!!!
I ain't a mom but why am I crying
You know what I hate? Now that I’m in middle school (ya ik know my pfp is kid like I am to lazy to change it) we do t make cards for our parents.  Just because we are older doesn’t mean we can’t love our parents smh 🤦‍♀️
I didn't cry, but it was a close one. To think of my little girl (she's 5) saying that kind of stuff... oh dear, I'd need boxes of Kleenex. That was super-sweet of you guys to do, really, especially the last set.
I dont have a mom I mean I have a mon but I can't see her because she was a prostitute she did drugs and was abusive....I havent seen her in 2 years and mothers day is a sad day for me...although I'm living with my aunt...I wish I had my biological mom...with me
Loved this! 😭
Almost nothing makes me cry
Change my mind
Edit: I made though the video without a single tear
4 kids? Props just for that ALONE.
Watching this pregnant oh man i’m balling😭😂
They should do the same for Father’s Day
The only thing that made me cry was the moms crying 😭
Every single time the Olympics mom vid plays I just ball my eyes out
Great! You should do one for Father’s Day too!
I don't have any children, but this had me in tears and made me want my mommy... happy mothers day to all the mothers out there!! Keep strong, keep your family strong!
“Keep reassuring your kid even when you’re scared” yeah that’s super tough :/
i usually don't watch these videos cause I'm like do i wanna cry umm nah I'm good but then I'm also like its good to cry and let it out sometimes so i watch them and cry rivers....fckn therapeutic why
I'm not a mom but I think of my mom supporting me everyday 😭
Why do I torture myself with these??? I know I am going to cry and make a fool of myself....😭
Yo, i’m a dude and I still cried.
Land before Time is sadder than Bambi
I love you mom.
React to I don’t care
I cried the 3 vid
No no I'm not a mum why am I tearing up
Why Tf did i cry!?

 I'm a GUY!!
im so great full i have a mom
I cried!
Should of done the scene from Brother Bear. Waaayyyy more emotional.
Am already a big softy so this video made me cry right away!!! When I see someone cry I usually end up crying. Plus is mom’s so I think about my mom which makes me cry. Because I’m so glad I have my mother and she’s all I have💗
I’m not a mom but I’m prob gonna cry
I cried on the first one
The last one was very unexpected
Madison's boyfriend was SO out of place. It was a mother-child moment. And I think the mom didn't like it either.
Sitting here pregnant, eating ice cream, and crying.
aight, WHOS CUTTING ONIONS??
Showed this to my mom and she was already sobbing in the first video
Bruh I’m not even a parent and I lost from the start 😂
the bambi one made me cry the most😭😭
you guys just turned me into a 46 year old blubbering baby, I am a mom of two amazing human beings, my son is 26, my daughter is 23 and I couldn't be more proud to be their mother... this video hit me hard!!
Im crying in public. This is not okay
I'm not even a mom and I'm crying!!
Why am I crying?? ugh now I wanna be a mom
These challenges always get me because we as viewers get to watch it more then once
I'm not even a mom and I'm crying waayyyy too much.
Ok I never sob, but tell me why I’m bawling
12:28... I cannot believe those are your kids!!! You look so young that I could swear they are your older siblings!!!
99% of the comments: no way Kristine has 4 kids
1% of the comments: iM nOt eVeN a MoM aNd iM cRyInG
12:28 is it just me, or do her kids look older than her?
It's sad just to think that those brave soldiers are fighting for there (Country) & people believe that .
Have their kids react to this!!
This shows how much a mother loves you ❤💜❤
We do this now for Father's day?  hehe.
I’m high key surprised the mom in the pink shirt has kids that old, she looks so young!
YOOOO I KNEW KRISTINE WAS A MOM BUT I THOUGHT LIKE OF A TOT OR SOMETHING?!?! SHE GOT FOUR WHOLE GROWN CHILDREN?!?! THAT WOMAN LOOKS LIKE SHE'S 32 TOPS?!?!
STUPID NINJA'S CUTTING STUPID ONIONS EVERYWHERE 😭❤️
Shout out to the great mom's #greatmom's
I was trying to avoid today and don't know why I decided to watch now I'm crying 😭😭 and missing my mommy
Wait lizbug's mom is on react?
I miss my mom :(
I don’t think I ever cried sooo much while watching an episode ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭
My birthday is 2 days after Mother's Day
I never cry immediately when watching a video, watching this makes me want to treat my mom better.
Who put salt water in my eyes ?
Thank you sooo much for doing this for us .. joining the react was the best decision I ever made
I know Jennifer's daughter somehow but I cant remember where I first saw her on YouTube
Guys
Hello
I call my mom almost every day.
5 for all the videos
So on mother’s day they showed the scene where Bambi’s mom died so on father’s day are they going to show the scene from the lion king where Mufasa dies
10:29 ....
Lol
Give a child everything they needs and they will be prepared for life, but take a child's mother away and their life is meaningless.
my brother is in the navy so yea the army one made me cry..
They be cold, giving Bambi such a low score.
Y'all breaking their hearts in a good way
8:28 from the heart of my bottom???
@8:27 from the heart of my bottom lol
12:29 No way she’s the mom of these four full grown ass adults!!!!!! 😲 she looks younger than all of them!!!!!!!!!!!!
Should have used the scene from Dumbo "Baby mine"... that no matter what ALWAYS makes me cry
Why was I crying?😭😂😂
I cried to much lmao
The girl in the sparkly pinkish/purplelish (forgot her name lol) looks like a teen!
who wanted to laugh (and laughed) throughout this video... Oh, just me ok.....
what a beautiful video <3
Everyone’s like I’m balling and I get it but I just didn’t cry and I feel bad now
Who else wants to just give their mom a big hug now?
i'm not even a mom but i cry in every single video
Might be THE best video so far for the FBE channel. 
Thanks❤
How could you NOT cry at bambi😑😑
I hope you do that on Fathers Day for fathers aswell
Can you react to I'm worried about Lia Marie Johnson?

I don't know if you guys remember her, but she used to be one of the reactors and part of the channel
dude i’m crying what
I love how faith's daughters are just as funny, happy and energetic as she is
The second video made me cry and im not even a mom
8:29 I hope that wasn’t intentional! Because i cracked up so hard with tears in my eyes! 😂 😂 😢
This was absolutely beautiful beyond words. 💟




Now I wonder if they'll even bother to do all of this for the  on Father's Day, or will they just make a public post saying "Happy Father's Day" and that's it... 🤔
The one in the Siquins shirt is a young mother. Wow she looks Good for having 3 kids. Happy mothers day to all
Happy mother's Day!!
B U T, Let's react to AJR shall we???
Awww😭🥰
Hold on... that is Lisabug’s mom?  Why was that a secret?
Mmm moms
Watching this makes me think of the day my mother will eventually pass and how heart broken I will b and reflect on the life she gave me me. My biggest fear is not being the son she deserved
React to motionless in white?
Anyone else cry!! I am great full for my mom because my father died and she is so stressed and I help get her through this and this mad meme cry!!
4:13 moms alway wach out  fo the kiss 😂😂😂 I'm dead
7:31 got me good 😢 😢 😢
☹️ mums are amazing. But I did for sure skip the bambi scene.
Happy Mother's Day ...
Tears of happiness is the best.
I was completely fine 
Until the personal videos 
Tears =:)
So we not gonna talk about ‘from the heart of my bottom’
dumbo lullaby?
Thank you for not using Baby Mine from Dumbo!
My mom was a single parent and I’m her only child, our bond is so strong, she’s my everything and my best friend. Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing mothers! 💐👸🏻👸🏼👸🏽👸🏾👸🏿❤️
I'm not crying you're crying 😭😭
MOTHERS ARE PHENOMENAL!!!
Here I am in regret watching this in class from curiosity. And now I'm trying not to get teared up in front of everyone :")
Man.... I cried too and these aren't even my kids... Wow
You guys took the wrong Disney scene. It should have been Dumbo's lullaby
AAAA I KNEW I KNEW THAT OLD LADY FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE!! I just thought I knew her from another react video but she’s LISBUG’s MOM!!!
Oh my gosh React coming in clutch with the Mother’s Day feels!
Wow seeing strong moms cry is soo emotional. Your mom never cries around you cause they need to seem strong and make you feel ok. But when they cry you knows it’s serious. I love moms! Especially mine!
Being a mother is the greatest thing in the world 🌎❤️ my son is the best thing that has happened to me 😭
So... from a video a while ago I take it that the lady in the blue shirt is a Trump supporter... Jaxon's mom... heard it from Jaxon himself...
The messages from their kids were really touching.
I wonder what those Dr. Phil daughters are doing
😄😊😅
"And it's like it's emotional, I just freAKING LOVE HIMMMMM
WAAAAAA"
Welp…
that's a mood.
In the beginning the narrator of the first video sounded like Morgan Freeman
I was just thinking to myself please don't put Bambi in there since it involves losing a mom and then BAM! I cried an ocean worth of tears. 😭😭😭😭💜💜💜
When she said “more because my mom isn’t with me “ was a 10/5  Instant tears. Ugh moms are amazing
I was crying the whole last part of the video, I want to be a mom 😊
I’m not a mother but this is so loving 

o(╥﹏╥)o

(இ﹏இ`｡)
I am sorry mom if I ever hurted you
10:45 little does she know he is a meme lol
i just cried cuz of not having a mom like them :( 

<3 to all of them!
The proper mother themed try not to cry video is WolfSong. Why will you never use it!!
The Bambi one is so sad because he is like “we made it mother” but his mom sadly didn’t make it.
im nnot a mom im 11 but still this got to me im so thankfuln to all the  mmoms !!!!!!1
This is soooo sweet. Happy Mother's Day!! I'm so blessed to have my mom, and so glad I could cook for her and our cousin. It beats trying to squeeze through folks in restaurants! <3 <3
the last two, olympics and bambi ones just got me so bad!!! im in tears and im not a mom ! makes me think about my mom and what she has done, and what she has sacrificed for us!!! <3 a mother's love is so beautiful!
Wait.. did she say from the heart of my bottom? 8:25 😂 Not trying to be rude or anything
The second video hit me hard knowing that my mother isn't there to love and support me during my tough times. I wish she was still with me because I need her...I really need her.
I cried
I’ve would’ve chose the baby of mine scene but that’s just me.
Yo Gina’s video hit hard bro
Do a try not to laugh with fathers and have the clips be just clips of kids falling and stuff
10:38 Her face tho. 🤣👏
Ik dying
I only bawled real hard when the kids made the videos for their moms 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

Kristine looks VERY young but all her kids look 20. She looks younger then most of them
Damn it FBE... I'm not crying... Youre crying.
this video should've been titled "asking moms to cry"
Kristine looks so young. She looks the same age as her kids 😱😱😱
I'm not mom but i cried 😅🙈❤
as a mom, i wanna cry too.. 😭
Kristine has like 4 grown kids???? I thought she was like 26 years old
Im sorry but holy crap....how old was Kristen when she had her children?? She has like 3 grown adult children and one teen..... 😑
It got me at Bambi 😭😢🥺
So I cried on all of them
happy mother’s day to all the moms out there!
React to Perfume!
okay but when tori’s mom talked about how hard she worked and how much she achieved, that made me tear up

Sis definitely doesn’t look like she has four grown kids
Kristine's kids are old what the fuck... How does she look that young
Try not to cry Game of Thrones edition !!!!
Hey fbe you choose a scp reactions the fbe?
Okay who’s cutting onion here?
Imma be honest, I don't know how none of their children said "I love you 3000." I would've done it.
I cried on every single one!

Wow great making moms cry for Mother’s Day what a great gift LOL
Everyone: Kristen looks so young to have 4 grown adult children
Me: Jennifer is Lisa Schwartz's mom?!
Damn. Must be nice having a mom. Mine dipped 10 years ago.
No Dumbo "Baby of Mine"?
I'm sorry, was Kristine 12 when she had those kids? Wtf? I'm 26 and I look older than her 😭
10:26 “ I freaking love him” literally the cutest thing ever 😭
Why are the comments answering so early?
12:41 WOW THEY DONT LOOK AS HER CHILDRENNN, THEY LOOK EVEN OLDER THAN THEIR MOM!!!

''heart to my bottom'' from the bottom of my heart
Wait, Jennifer is Lisa Schwartz's mom??
I was shook when 4 grown ups said happy Mother’s Day to the lady in pink.. she looks sooo young!! Like damn!
Is it a coincidence that the word "cry" is in the url of this video?  Probably 😶 ...

Lucas is so freaking cute
Love you 3000 mom ❤️
Does anyone else have a flood of tears? yeah, me too
This is so sad for me, I hate mother's day because I was abandoned by mine. It makes me so sad
I’m crying and I’m not even a mom 🤦🏽‍♀️😭
Kristine is a mom of 4???? She looks so young tho!!! 😱😱😱
Can you to this for Father's Day too?
I think the producers really need to explain the difference between emotional and sad.
Grrrr me big man no cry.
(Starts showing the kids videos to their mom) 
Intense Tears
Thank you for this video. I needed to let all the emotions out because I haven't seen my mom for a year now because I'm an international student in the States right now and it's just really hard for me to not see her until another year because we're not that well off given that she and my dad has been working so hard to get me where  I am today. Although it breaks my heart, I'm so happy to see these mom feel loved and I hope mine feels the same even when I'm not there with her. Happy Mother's Day to everyone!
Jeannie’s vid made me cry 🥵😂
This was very comforting given that I couldn't see my mother today to wish her a happy mother's day. Finals are tomorrow and I had to prepare. Hopefully things go well. But Happy Mother's Day everyone!
Bro my names madison and when turbulence hits I’m like “Jesus forgive us all”
That was one of the best videos guys!!
Happy mother's Day to all the mothers of the world.

It’s so sweet to see how much they really care for their kids because there are so many ppl who don’t and it just breaks your heart to know that there are ppl out there who bring children into the world just for them not to care so Bravo FBE👏🏼
10:34
Lucas: Happy Mother’s Day mom.
Lucas’s mom:*rolls her eyes*. 😂
The Bambi one gets me every time 😭
Do you ever just have those moments when you realize how much you love your mom and how much she does for you? This video just gave me one of those moments. I love my mom soooo much❤️
I may be heartless but Bambi never made me cry😂
Some of us won't ever get to celebrate mother's day with our mom anymore, but I'm happy for those who do! Happy Mother's Day ❤
Y’all got me fucked up
13:06 is that Shane’s ex girlfriend?
The mamas crying is making me bawl the whole video😭❤

12:29 that mother doesn't look old enough to have grown ass men as babies! Love it! She's absolutely beautiful.
I'm not even a mom and I'm a mess! Holy crap I cried SO MUCH ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END
Just today my mom was at church, in our old church region. It’s Mother’s Day today so they put on a video for all the moms. It was clips. Clips of all the teens now but from 2010 as little kids around 4-5 years old. They were saying the reasons why they loved their moms and just as my mom was explaining it to me, my brother, who was in the video, called and she was in tears.
Y’all better be showing dads the same love!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I'm crying!!!! I love these moments that celebrate mamas. 😩
Why you wanna make moms cry
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO DO THIS FOR FATHERS
React to bye sister
I was really horrible to my mother sometimes, and she died before i could really say sorry and show her how much i appreciated and loved her, for i know she did her best no matter how ill she was :(
Youtubers react to article 13 passed!

I can see why Lucas is such a sweetie. His mom is such a sweetie too!
Not even a mum and I'm crying 😣😣
I’m no mother but I’m crying 😂
For all those with alcoholic mothers or liars or cheaters or whatever, Ask yourself,  if shes being the best mother to you. Even if shes not a good wife or a good person. Ask yourself if shes the best mother she could be. If she is, appreciate it. If she's not 
Change it. You're her kid. There's noone on this earth who should matter to her more!
this is sooooooooo sad
I hope you are going to do something just like this for Father's Day?!
The Mom wit the pink sparkly  shirt looks hella young ‼️you sure those are her kids?
Its weird. Ive never cried watching a movie or video, so cheers to this one.




Edit: Guys I passed. Ik no one cares but the ending actually had me feeling a bit emotional.

I remember when I was five I always thought Babi’s mom ran away and then my mom told me what really happened and then my little five year old heart broke and I cried
I thought I wasn't going to cry but I did
So happy and emotional 😣😣😣😣💔💔💗💙💘💘

My mom only watched Bambi once when she was a kid, and let’s just say that she never did again.  It was too sad for her.  This was so sweet!  I hope you will do this with the Fathers too on Father’s Day!
Seeing people cry makes me cry. 😭

I’m not even a mom yet and I’m crying loads especially the army one I can’t imagine not seeing your kids or your mom for a long period of time.My mom also lost her mom so I feel grateful for her that she is super strong and is taking care of me Happy Mother’s Day
It must have been nice to have a close connection with your mom
mothers day was 10 february
I'm not even a mum and im crying like there's no tomorrow
The ending 😭
I only managed to get as far as I have gotten because of my mother. It is not an easy road but she works hard for me and my brother. Love you mom, always.
woah i never realized she was lisbug’s mom, but now that i think about it i should have noticed
Happy mother's day to all of the mothers out there!
Now i need to punch something to regain my manliness


What am I saying, my mom is the best!
some people do 15-20 months deployed, i am in the same states as my kids and havent seen them in 2 yrs or spoken to them in a yr... should really notice people around you more
From the heart of my bottom?!😂😂
Are you gonna show the Lion king scene for Father’s Day? Because I need to know to bring tissues or not.
Did she just say ~yikes~
as someone who grew up without a father constantly in my life, i always looked up to my mom. when i have anxiety, fear, anything, i look up to my mom. she’s a hard working woman. working 3 jobs, she always wanted to support my dreams of becoming a gymnast and paid for my tuition. she didn’t have to do that, but she knows how happy it makes me. she’s tough, and she never shows any fear. thank you mommy, for constantly making me feel okay and reassuring me that everything will be okay. happy mother’s day to all of the tough mommy’s out there.💗 i’m wishing every beautiful mommy a blessed mother’s day😻
I’m not crying you are 🤧
Such a feel-good episode. I hope to see something similar for Father's day.
I lost my mom 17 years ago Everybody appreciate what you got because it still hurts like hell everyday. Nobody loves you like your mom
The army one got to me a little because when I was younger my dad was in the navy so I didnt see him for long periods of time so I understand how that kid felt
I always thought Kristine was in her ealry 30's! girl you are blessed barley looking older than your kids.
Hi love you guys and happy mothers day!
y’all these mums are emotional lol
This video made me realize that some teens actually had their parents on react too.
It was a bad idea going from watching We Three's audition from last year's AGT to this... XD I'm doing alright
If FBE loves there fans they would pin this
‘oh no kayden’ shoos him away**
I love you guys so much and this is so sad
Why cry
12:47 wow she looks good for her age, i thought she was in her early 30's
Woah woah woah...first of all, happy Mother’s Day to all of the moms out there...secondly...THOSE are Kristine’s kids?!? Are you kidding?! I was expecting her kids to be like 5, 6, 7...friggin dude had a beard! Get outta town. Lol. She looks INCREDIBLE!! I mean all of the moms are wonderful but holy moly. Lol. All this time of watching her on this channel I thought for sure she had elementary age kids. Holy smokes. Hahaha...
My jaw hurts... And my eyes feel watery... 😭😭😭😭
Whaaaat @12:29 that girl looks soo young I was expecting an infant or something not four full grown adults!!! Giiirl you’re doing something right. 😍
Didn't we already have Mother's day weeks ago on the 4th Sunday of Lent 31st March?
I'm 7 minutes in. I swear to Christ if I see littlefoot trying to wake up his mom I'm going to lose it.
What doing?
😭 I didn’t know that she was lizzbugs mom . Also the mom with 4 grown ass men and she looks so young
Of course, their kids always be their babies forever... there's no more beautiful words to describe how great our mother.. I love mother in this world.. they are such a great woman ever.
That’s lisbugs mom
Sorry coming through with some freshly chopped onions
FBE's next video about father 
Happy fathers day ... Uhhhh sorry
There's a reason I haven't watched Bambi in 40 years - because that scene DESTROYED ME as a kid! NOT FAIR!
Well, I am a crybaby now.
I love this video so cute ❤️
Anyone else from UK where mother's Day was 31st of March
Omg Lisa heyyyy 😂, I lost it on all of them lmao, loved this episode 💖
When I see people cry I cry so there was a lot of tears watching this
Video Ratings For Me

1st Video- I give that one a 5 because I cried so much. 😭



2nd Video- I give this video a 4 and 1/2 but only because it DOES take a strong person to make a strong person 😭❤️



3rd Video- A 5 because I CANNOT imagine being without my mom 😥
I had no idia lizbugs mum was on react I've been watching her from when she and Shane got together
Bambi got me 
It always does
Happy mother's day 🎉👱
The Bamby one got me
FBE: *Moms try not to cry challenge *
Jennifer: wow, that was so powerfull.
My dad teaches English to young children in China and last week he organized a competition where the kids prepared little speeches about how much they loved their moms with cool prizes....it apparently got pretty wild. The kids took it very seriously and the judging was hard.
Cried through all the vids... Except Bambi
My mom divorced me dad...I don’t have a mom to say “happy Mother’s Day.....”   𝒲𝒾𝓈𝒽 𝒾 𝒽𝒶𝒹 𝒶 𝓂ℴ𝓂...
I’m crying as if I’m a mother :)
I wanna hug my mum now 😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😓😓😅😆😆😆😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Beginning- me:I’m not goin to cry
Middle- still me: do you have another tissue box?
Person next to me: you already has 30!
End- me: Is this even a challenge?
12:39 Damn she looks so young. I expected her kids to be very little due to how young she looks but her sons are grown asf 😂
This gave me shivers! Awe
Makes me wish I had a mom.
June is coming soon.... and time for Father’s Day edition!!!!!
(Try not to cry or other challenges)
I cried because they cried, especially when they showed videos of their kids wishing them Happy Mother's Day. Thank you to my mom and all the moms out there!!!
this is so cute I'm crying
I'm freaking crying and I'm not a mom... just a child and I'm just having waterfalls 😭
I can only wish I look as young as Kristine when I have kids the same age as hers.  You go, girl!
LISA MADE ME BALL😭
I cried at the end!!! 🤣😅
I cried through all of these
Im 15 and im not even a mother , but I cried
In my country mothers day happened like 3 months ago
0:28 “We’re not picking our favorite kid are we?” Lol 😂
I am actually crying 😂
 And I am actually sick right now 🤕💊😵
React to Logic's new album, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. PLEASE!!!
GAAAA IM.CRYING
This should be done for father's day as well
Happy Mother’s Day to all the moms reading this 😊
I’m not a mom and I’m in tearsss
I’m literally shaking, this was so emotional and made me literally bawl, I’m a 19 and I felt this in my heart
I'm not crying😭😭😭😭😭😭 your crying😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING
Kristine looks 27!! i thought her children were going to be like 8 or something but when i saw her actual children i thought they were her siblings at first haha
I cried through this entire episode
I instantly lost ^^;
I cried. I failed this challenge.
i’m not a mom, i’m a teenage boy but i sure did cry a lot.
React to Godzilla king of the monsters trailers.
These videos didn't make me cry but those momma's commentaries through out sure did!
This got me so badly. I lost my mom last year and watched her die.
She was unresponsive in her last moments so I didn't know if she was able to really hear me or not when I said my goodbyes. At the end where their sons and daughters made the videos for them is what made me cry the most. To the people who are reading this comment, don't ever take your parents for granted. Especially your mother. You only get one so make the moments count. 
Happy Mother's Day!
Jeannie and Jaxon got me crying
Oh my God, Jennifer is Lisbug's mother?!? :O I had no idea lol
“We’re not picking our favorite kid are we?”

So you’re saying you have a favorite
wait....JENNIFER IS LISBUG’S MOM?! WTFFFF
#TryNotToCry9yearolds
Kids try not get scared from super old movies
I'm not even a mom and I'm crying 😩

Where is Ace Birth ?
Im crying rivers how can they do it?!
Try fans react to try not to cry,mad,sing,etc
Anyone else cried during this?
Not gonna lie, I didn’t cry until I saw the personal videos. Makes me wish I could do stuff with my mom like this, but I can live vicariously through the FBE Staff. I’m lucky I found you guys and this channel.
Congratulation ma ma Lucas,for raise that kid very well
Can we see a Father’s Day video too 😭 Also, those are Kristine’s children?! 😮 She looks so young compared to them
Can someone STOP cutting the darn onions!!!!
ppl crying about soldiers who go to Iraq or Afganistan  ...
When they have no business invading another country in the first place.
What makes me cry is the families caught in the war, losing their loved ones in front of their eyes bcz uncle sam needs more oil
Pff so thankful for having a loving mom, all of the videos make me cry :(
This is really sad especially the kids video one
I dIDn't CrY, nO I rrEaLLy diDn'T!!!!! Even tho Im 10 I still cryed!!😢
Omg now I’m crying at the personal ones and I’m a 17 year old guy
This is really song
That was so beautiful💕
I'm not crying, you're crying. Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there.
I... H A T E it, when the excuse for the lack of the emotional impact is "Because it's a Cartoon"
You should've included the scene from The Flash Season 1 Finale when Flash goes back in time to save his mom and watches her die.
I like Bambi movie... 😭😭😭
7:02 when you lose your mom in Walmart
"it takes someone strong, to make someone strong" 
                            Thank you Mom ☺️
i dont know why im crying
why is no one else talking about not realizing lisa schwartz is jennifer’s daughter?
That Bambi scene really fucked me up
Now we need dads to react to sad videos, on Happy Father's Day :)))))
All of the parents messages from their kids were all so heartwarming. They were all so sweet. 😊😊❤❤
Bambi still makes me cry. That part is soooooo sad 😢😢😢
I did not cry. So..... Did anyone else didn't cry?
Is there a moms react? Cause there should be
1st 2 were a 1.5. # 3 is a 4 because my mom is dead. Let's go. It's a dub. I'm as dry eyed as before I watched.
Knew i was gonna cry before i even watched. Shoutout to all the beautiful mothers ♥️😭
I’m not even a mom and all of these made me cry

Happy Mother Day! Have a good day with your mom, bro
React to Alec Benjamin
That Bambi scene. Nooooo! You can't beat the LittleFoot and his mom though. 😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤
"no you didn't."
I thought the same
I’m crying because even if I made something nice to my mom, she would just probably say “make it better.”
Why does Jennifer's daughter look so familiar?
Omg when they saw the videos from their kids I really started crying😭
I’m not crying you are😭
Can I get a like on my birthday






Guess not 😐
12:40 GTFO! She looks amazing for four GROWN kids!!!!
"Bamboo, I promise. The rest cramped. Crabs the nebula."

Teens React to Trevor Noah plz
I did not cry cus I realize that why cry it's useless cus it's just a waste of energy
My mom passed away this year, right as I left for college. Today is the first mother's day without her and watching this made it so much more difficult.
Wtf why does Kristen look younger than all of her kids
Yeah show a kid met hes mom, while problably She is the reason Children in Afghanistan dont have a mom anymore. Yeah hypocryts level at 9000
Oops, its my birthday :p
7:28 what she said made me cry out of everything
Dude WTF that one with 4 kids actually seriously looks like she could be their sister!!!!! 🤯
Happy Mother's Day! I know you're watching from heaven, mom! 😢
Our mothers did many things for us now it is time to help them and make them happy of what they had made
Bambi's mum dying made me happy; my dad hunted deer when I was really small, so I this scene reminded me of dinner.

10:06 
Oohh two Jojo posters and that's sweet that their kids did a video for them
I'm gonna guess heart of my bottom is an inside joke to them, like when you say something backwards as a child and its sticks forever
Teens react to Steven Crowder.
I'm not a mom and I cry OH GOD
I hate this video because it shows that people actually have moms that loves them unlike me
For all the mothers out there including my own. Have a very blessful Mother's Day. ♥️♥️♥️

Happy Mother’s Day FBE

Okay but that bambi scene in spanish is more heart wrenching
Mother’s Day is 22nd of March 
Today is the 12th May
Should have had them react to rugrats the movie when chuckie didnt have a mom to dance with. That shit hits me hard since my mom abandoned me at 13 when my dad passed. But i didnt let that tarnish my views of mothers. Much love to all the good mothers out there although we might not always show it we love you with all our hearts. Happy mothers day.
I had no idea Jennifer was the Mom of Lisa.
co co co co co co co co combo breaker T_T
Man, when did it start raining in my room? my face is all wet
This was such a sweet video for the moms 😊
YALL MADE ME CRY!!!!
Yep this mom cried! Especially at the individual videos to the moms!💜
Yoooo, is that Lisa Schwartz's mom at 13:05? I didn't know that xD
RIP to all the mom’s that couldn’t be here. Happy Mother’s Day
When they showed them the clips of their kids, tell me why I started crying too..
Protect us from WHAT? the boogeyman
Yall i dont want my mom to get old or leave me😭
I cry seeing others cry.
bambi and the lion king get me every time
I wish me and my mom were like this :/
You got me. I can't.
I'm crying because even though I still have my mom (I'm 22), I feel alone, I don't feel loved and it made me realize that I'm really craving it, really badly.
I feel so lonely, my mom doesn't know, she wouldn't understand, deep down she's not a bad mom, I don't know I'm a bit lost
Should have shown the scene from Tarzan!!!
Even tho I’m not a mom I’ll still watch this
Why her kids look older than her
The bambi would've been sad for me if I didn't keep thinking about the meme
I thought Kristine was in her 20s! I hope to look that young when I’m her age!
Fan the eyes ladies fan the eyes
I Love You Mom💖
Mom I luv you 3000
Happy Mother’s Day to all my moms 💖💖
Should've shown them The Land Before Time, the part with Littlefoot and his mom. That hits hard man.💔🦕
Love how literally everything made me cry. This is my last Mother’s Day before going off to college and I’m the oldest out of my sister and I, so this just hits me really hard. We love all moms, so to any who see this, Happy Mother’s Day. You are all so appreciated
I was on the verge of tears until she said "heart of my bottom" 8:28
Respect to moms✊🏻
8:51 i have no idea why but i immediately started crying
ahhh this was 1 hr ago!!! I feel so special💯
Just lost my mom recently and my dad long time back and this is my first ramadhan and Mother's Day without her i miss her so much
Aww this was beautiful 😭😭😭 Moms really are  important people in a person's life. Happy mothers day! 💕💕💕👩🏾👩🏼👩🏻
Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful moms who read this.
Jaxon's mom's reaction to his video is amazing 😂😂
I am not a mom but i cry
You should've shown dumbo, as well.
There needs to be another guess the song challenge. Instead of just songs why not theme songs from tv shows?
bambi’s a low blow😭😭😭
8:28 heart of my bottom? What?
8:28 from the heart of my bottom?
They're making me cry. I don't even have any kids 😭😭😭
bambi will get me every time
I love seeing the Mom's from Parents React, and some of the Kids/Teens/College Kids' react cast's mothers. Happy Mother's Day to all Moms and Mother-like figures (humans and animals)!
Should've played that 1 rugrats episode!
I have no children but im tearing up.
not even a mum and I'm sitting in my lecture hall balling at the olympic games video
I cried and yet I'm a boy
I'm not even a mom and I'm crying 😭😭😭😂😂💜💜💜
there is nothing in the world that can beat a mothers love and care for her child and that touches my heart deep 😭 HAPPY MOTHERs DAY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jaxon really looks like his mom!!!
Can you show some Iraqi sad moment pls?
❤️😪😭
React to top 10 best selling boybands (worldwide)
this is awsome
0:03 why does that kid have messed up eyebrows? 🤨
What did you guys give your moms?
12:30 WHAT THE!?!?! She has children that are that old but she looks that young?!?! They look around 20, but she doesnt look a day over 25. If I didnt know any better I'd think they were siblings.
I think I have no hart, I didn't cry. I was a bit happy lol
happy Mother’s Day everyone uwu
12:50 she looks so young am I the only one who’s blown away by the fact she has kids that old
For the hole video I was sad. Expect for bambi. But its so sweet how kids  love their mom and dad. It just makes me emotional and happy for them. Cause their love for parents. Its just so sweet and emotional.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Why is Mothers Day in the US in May while here in the UK it's in March?
What a bunch of crybabies
😭😭
Who tf is bombi
Hope they do the same thing for Fathers day! <3
Haven’t seen my mother for 6 years and still crying
Gosh darn it, I knew I shouldn't have watched this before calling my mom because I absolutely lost it. My mom has done so much for me and given me my life back after I went through a really hard time (and she obviously gave life to me in the first place) and I wouldn't be where I am today without her. So to quote the latest episode of Fruits Basket, "She deserves the moon but would never ask you for it." Happy Mother's Day to her and all the mom's and mother figures out there because you are amazing.
I'm tearing up and I don't have any kids yet. Also, kinda proud of that kids, to appreciate their mothers and thanking them for everything they do for them. I am sure it's super hard being a good parent. This episode is a very nice reminder for all of us, to remember where we come from and who made us the way we are ❤️ well done
I'm not crying you are .
Kids : mom your the best person someone could have



Dad : what did you say
Holy moly, I totally did not know that Jennifer was Lisa Schwartz's mom
I cried on the first one
And the 2nd one
Omg I forgot that was Lisa Schwartz’s mom!
They should've played the scene where Dumbo is being rocked back and forth by his mother. That is a tear jerker, mother and child.
That is sad but great video
I cried at every video
Soldiers getting reunited with their famailies always gets me
When is mothers day? 🤔
I wish my mom ever just told me that everything was gonna be ok...
I cried...and I'm not even a mom lol....like especially when their own kids made a video...it reminds me of how lucky I am to have a mom that works hard everyday
I totally didn’t even realize that was Lisa’s mom lol
I am not a mom but I also cry. Happy mothers day.
My mother today


Me and my family- buys Apple Watch and hands it to her*

Mom:thank you for the jewelry
This is so cute 💝, and to think my 4 year old handed me a Mother’s Day card and said “here Mommy “ and I almost cried ☺️

Who watching the videos more than the reactions?!
i’m on my period and i have a toxic relationship with my mom, this wrecked my emotions
Did anybody else catch that at 8:28 ?
bro why am I crying
(On mother's day)

Me: (takes a piss)

Mom:  
you people have me 😭😭😭
God fricking dammit I shed a tear
Good Lord, I wasn't prepared!
Jennifer's daughter is freaking GORGEOUS!
It’s so dumb we have to have a day of the year where we think about how much our mothers do for us you should  tell your mother you love her everyday
13:04 Lisa? Aka Lisbug? Whoa that is so sweet she created a small clip for her mother 💖💖💖💖💖
the fact that my mom is never there for me and has never been is the reason this video made me cry because , I can’t relate to this.
I remember watching Bambi for the first time. I never knew what was going on when his mom got shot. I didn't know what a hunter was so I never knew the gun shots as what they were. I was very confused.
I don't even have kids and I'm crying rivers rn
¿Alguien mas vino a escoger una Suegra?

They better do the exact same on fathers day.
I wanna hug my mom now ❤️❤️
that girl with a lot of makeup and sparkly shirt did not look like a mom at all
I don’t have a mom but life is hard.
It's now official: LUCAS IS BEST BOY
This is just cruel to my emotions
I cried in every video😢
It's the first time i've cried from a try not to cry, and it's from the special videos at the end. I've blessed my mom today god, this was epic.
13:05 is that lisbug????
Mothers day was in March?

Even though im 11 im still crying 😂😂
Oh god if they went back and looked at Bambi's mom after she died, the moment would've destroyed so much more.

Jesus Kristine looks so good. She looks amazing for how many kids she has. I would guess that she is a college kid, but I'm way off.
I love my mom so much! I'm so happy she and I kept a strong relationship! I couldn't have been happier to have spent the past years with her!

Side not, my friends call me mom(mom friend) and they all sent me "happy mother's day" text.

I love this!

Much love to all the moms out there who love their babies!
U got me FBE.😢😭😭 Happy day to all moms. For their great work.
Returning soldiers always freaking get me😢
For those of you out there who have a mother who loves you, takes care of you, and breaks her back or busts her butt for you, please tell her you love and appreciate her. Get her something nice; Make her a card yourself, hug her, buy her a simple candle or some real fancy earrings, etc.
Just tell her and show her how much you care. 💕

My mother may have died just this January, but that didn't stop me.
My mothers' day (and 1-day early birthday) gift to her were some really pretty flowers from my local supermarket + I made something and bought a card for my grandmother.
Omg hiii I’m early!!!





I’m scared I won’t ever see my dad again bc of my mum and dad fighting...


 I’m about to cry 😭😭😭😭








I now know to watch on Father’s Day now 😂😂😂

Such a great opportunity missed  to have shown the polar bear baby and rug mother in this vid
12:54 why does she look younger than her own children
But how does mama Kristine has 4 grown up kids??
Happy Mother's day to all the Moms of React, Father's day is next right so all dads be ready on 16th of June.
I’m not even a mother and I’m over here tearing up
Respect 🙌🏻 god bless mamas , the kindest soul ❤️
7:33 OMG
Mom
You can never be 100% a great or good mother; but you can be a mother 100% of the time. You will never keep your child 100% safe nor can you correct 100% of their problems and you will feel like you fail 100% of the time. You will pray 100% of the time because 50% of the time that is all you can do for your child and you will be miserable about it. You will be judged 100% of the time for your performance as a parent and care 40% of the time; this percentage will be influenced by number of children and length of parenthood. There is a 0% chance that you will ever stop being a mom regardless the age of your child and you will continue the above process 100% of the time.
Written to me from me; but for you too

Happy Mother’s Day Everybody! For a great day for you to if you subscribe to me, tell me in the chat thing on my comment and I will to.

Oh crap i forgot today was mother's day 😓
I DEFINITELY DIDNT CRY MY EYES OUT
I bet that on Father's Day they will do a Father's react and invite all the dads to do reactions.
Damn I wish my mom was better. I wish she wold take my side and belive me when it comes to serious things. She doesnt know how much it hurts.
These made me cry and I’m not even a mom
I cried on every one of these videos, even the personal ones! Moms go through so much for us so thank you for making this video ❤️
happy mother´s day to all the mothers out there, you are all the greatest gift to us and we love you.
I not crying you’re crying 😭

Y was crying on the last ones
What????? 12:40????  Kristine's a mom of those older kids???? I always thought she was a college kid lolol God bless her
Thank you so much react
You made me cry
Wait lisbug’s mum/mom is a reactor? I didn’t know that, I have seen her react to things a lot of times and I had no idea she is Lisbug’s (Shane Dawson’s ex girlfriend) mum/mom
12:29 Would never have guessed she was old enough to have kids that old.  She looks at most 30.
If you do a Father’s Day one I swear to God you’d better include “I love you 3000”
I luv my mama💘
Early for once...
How old is Kristine?! I did not know she had 4 kids!!!
Awesome tribute for Moms FBE. You da best!
This video made me miss my mom even more... today would have been her 83rd birthday.

Fathers: Hmm ok
I'm told when my dad was really young, balled his eyes out after seeing bambi in theaters when it came out and was completely inconsolable for roughly a month because of that particular scene

This was really sweet, now let’s all go and wish our mothers a happy Mother’s Day and tell her we love her.
bruh I'm not a mom but I'm bawling
OOhh good graciOUS!!! I thought they were gonna do the sad scene from Brave. Cuz that counts as something sad for mothers day. Also because since Merida missed Elinor as herself, I just thought there would be tears streaking down their cheeks.
Probably not though 😕
I gotta say Kristen kids are grown I’m speechless how good she looks
13:05 Lisa
I’m not even a mom and at the end when they showed their kids video I was crying I don’t even know why
Damn I am not even a mother nor are any of them my kids, but their messages were so sweet I couldn't help turning into a blubbering mess

Hi fbe!
Fuck US imperialism and anyone who signs up to be part of it.
Should've shown them the flash. Scene in season one finale where he goes back in time. Just would have needed to give them a short explanation. Would've broken them.
1:55 it's sad when eventually the child become able to see his mom, but it's much more sad when the Afghani kid wake up the next morning to see his mother or his father has been gone forever, because of these slodiers.

I'd definitely watch that show. I loved the original. And I think Will has been a great addition too YouTube. He embraces the community well. He even had Liza Koshy in a video or two.
Yessssss!!!!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼we fucking need this show! Omg. My childhood restored!!!!!!
2:15 the irony.
I mean the storyline of the show was kind of dark to begin with. That episode when Will's dad dipped out was one of the most emotional episodes of any show I've ever seen
“It’s so relative to nowadays”....I think you mean either relevant or relatable girlie

I like it who ever came up with this kinda cool
Teala Dunn is on this reacting to pretty cool
Is it me or Will sounds like miles in spider man into the spider verse when he says "ye im will"
Every reboot is dark I'm over it
The wird thing is a darker remake of the Fresh Prince has potential, seeing as how dark Wills past was on the show. They downplayed it a lot, but Will could've easily ended up in a street gang with guns and drugs and shit in Philly, if his aunt hadn't shipped him off.. Deadbeat dad, absent mom etc.
That would be a movie worth watching Day one.
Yesss. I've always thought, if you stripped the jokes out, Fresh Prince had some surprisingly serious themes. Guns, muggings, gang violence, child abandonment, predjudice these were all themes touched on in the original.
I would watch the hell out of that.
"I hate when people try to redo something" she cries every week in her kitchen, that counts as a remake
Finally a great youtubers react line up.
SO GLAD THE COMPLETIONIST IS ON HERE!!!
Lol I thought it was a movie trailer. 🤦🏾‍♀️
First things first rest in peace uncle Phil..for real
6:59 my exact reaction when I first saw it too.
Such a meta episode - shout out to all youtubers! Will be interesting to see how the creators (youtubers) develope once the real money gets thrown around. (i.e.from the commercials). It is going to be a different ball game. Original or not. This clip has a nostalgic vibe already.
Only heard of 3 of them

miss piggy doesnt like it
I ain’t gonna lie. The fan made trailer looks intense and cool and I like that they respected the source material. BUT...

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON’T REMAKE FRESH PRINCE!!!

Leave it and respect it as it is
I think Will Smith is gonna get behind this
This trailer has to be funded/invested. Please @Will Smith do something about this! I’m compromised to watch. 👏🏻
To keep you from watching this
It's basically like the bel air but more serious and more of killing childhood
Please lord dont let this crap become a real tv show, I think its an ok idea but even thoe it they really didnt get into the drama like they wanted to of the original i think this will take it to far and would be terrible as a reboot. if it happens i say 3 episodes and people will come to thier sences
2:18 redo your face again then talk
I clicked cuz of Dangmatt smith
omg now i wish he would do a drama-trailer for the nanny- modern version, with or without designer outfits (fran used alot of deigneroutfits on the original) but has to be the fashion of today and she probably has to be a makeup guru on instagram instead of going door-to-door with her makeup.
Less gangsta culture, more responsible fathers.
Will Smith Reacts to YouTubers React To Will Smith Reacts To NEW Bel-Air Trailer!!! Do IT!!
I need this to be made for real!!!! It was really good
The problem I have is that when a celebrity makes a YouTube channel they don't have to put in the work to have Subscribers or a following I mean they're already celebrities all people have to do is see their name and they get millions of subscribers actual YouTubers me to continuously upload videos try and collab with already more popular YouTubers to get their name out there Etc so to me personally celebrities with YouTube channels aren't actual YouTubers.
Power of YouTube =🧠.  🤯
Holy sh*** I thought it was a legit movie trailer that’s good quality dang omg lol yeah the trailer was good
Anyone else see Jonathan Morrison in the video? LOL TLD
yep... this is youtube now
Tim gained mad respect for that J Cole line!
what gets me is everyone always remembers Fresh Prince as a funny show first, and it absolutely was hilarious and brilliant... but part of it's brilliance was that while being funny it touched on a lot of huge, important, powerful and serious issues. it was more than a sitcom, it changed and shaped an entire generation of kids and young adults in such an impactful way WHILE being so damn funny. and relatable.

also. like. this would be the best way to reboot a series, not whatever sonic is doing... and i'm a little disappointed it's not gonna be an actual thing.

I grew up with the original, and I'd love to see a dramatic retelling. The trailer alone was enough to sell me on it, but seeing Will Smith himself so enthusiastic about it is an added layer of awesome. He's long been one of my favorite actors.
fresh prince was something i watched 1000th times RIP uncle phil your the realest
Meh, not interested. I'm a sitcom purist lol.
Can you do "Teens/College Students react to Bye Sister"?😂
It would be a cool movie that's for sure but a whole series... Not to sure

Omg JBunzie!!! She looks so pastel I love it ^^
Nope... can’t jump on this one...
Youtubers React to Will Smith Reacts to?? huh?
Bruh I really loved the original if they make it a drama I’m gonna get pissed

I Hate reboots, it just destroys the past things, and shows that  imagination has disappeared. As a fan made ok, total new reboot no way.
Is FBE trying to hit a quota or something bringing the drag queens in?
How did they not recognise Jonathan Morrison in it!?
Generations should react to DEUTSCHLAND by Rammstein. You already did an episode on Rammstein a couple of months ago I believe, and now they are back with a new single. It already gathered 48 Million views which is A LOT for German standards. It's very controversial, as for the majority of the Music Video it almost solely depicts the bad moments and eras of Germany's history, while the lead singer (as a German citizen) sings about wanting to love Germany, but he's simply incapable of doing so (this is just a VERY brief summary, there's a lot of symbolism and other stuff).
Anyone catch at the end where she said to 'subscribe to the all YouTubers **who came and shot with us today**'... not the 'YouTubers in this episode'?
This looks dumb.
No one is going to mention the symbolism in the trailer? 



Yeah that Eye of Horus is pretty popular in street gangs, a second eye up top. 



Then the crown... heart shaped emblem on the center, yep pretty lit too. Here I thought I was scrutinized for liking Kingdom Hearts.
It reminds me of Riverdale and how it's been reimagined making it relevant to today
I love Chris Klemens lol
Generations should react to the rocketman trailer
Or will or another person will jump fund that. I think its a brilliant idea.
What kind of punishment is being sent to Bel Air. Will should of messed up a long time ago.
Hahaha Pretty good Stuff
They seriously need to make a movie out of this!
What in the hell is even that ?
Yay Chelsey is on it! I mean Kelsey of course ;-)
Wow the first sighting of a Californian komodo dragon!
At 12:43 chris klemens reminded me why I lije watching him
666k views
I mean, it's been +20 years since Fresh Prince ended. A remake would be fine for the new generation and I think it would be interesting to see the show from a different point of view
Does it have to be so serious?
Plz, plz plz, do Generations react to Godzilla: King of Monsters final trailer.
Looks good. Please do not reboot fresh Prince tho.
How to make a blockbuster movie trailer
When is it out
No you
I hate the trailer , I won’t watch it, I hate that everything is getting remade as “real”
I see what Trish is saying BUT I think shes over exaggerating (in normal trish  fashion). She realized it was a remake of a show she watched when she was growing up and felt insecure about her age. That's all that was. I love you Trish but you need to open your mind as wide as you open those thighs.
This is tight!!!! :)
The real question. Make this a tv series or a movie
FUUUNNND ITTTTT WILLLLLLLLLL
ThatOneVideoGamer WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT, also trish wtf were you even doin, you trashed the guy for remaking a series, then were like I do stuff like this why don’t people come collab with meeeeeeeeeeeeeee

I bet I know the exact bridge he was going under on 71. If you're going south bound, there's an underpass that is just about long enough for that for formed flash to happen.
React to azzers modern rap songs in voice impressions please it’s really good
Its okay, I didn't know what this was till I saw this video. Gotta say I don't really like reboots. Movies and especially TV shows are hit or miss with this. It does seem real and more relevant so I like it. While the original had its moments of addressing real problems and going dark like the time Will had drugs on him and his cousin was willing to lie for him or the time Will talked about his father, but mainly it stayed happy and light with Will doing funny things. Nowadays they have more serious and grounded shows and this "trailer" reflects that. Too bad its not really coming out. They did a great job. It really does sound like a good idea.
React to some more memes
"having not even watched the show this looks good" well that's why it looks good  🤦‍♂️

Interesting and funny the answers these youtubers gave about celebrities being in youtube now. Sister snakey nikita dragun, doesn't really embrace them, delaghetto is cool because he already hang out with celebrities and others were on point about celebrities being in a different category of youtubers  which I concur until these celebrities start doing collabs with regular youtubers
I love that Trish is in this
14:07 my reaction was the same
These whitefolks tho
4:25 ew

Wow, this is a real remake unlike sonic Cough
IT CHAPTER 2
I don’t think it will be as good as fresh prince, nobody can recreate it
8:04
Surprised FBE didn't insert a sound clip to that reference.
Jirard? hell yeah! Cool Beans.
you should put jbunzie in your videos more !!
i just saw jirard at the begining and automatically liked
JBUNZIE ❤️
They really filmed at Bishop Ward 🥺
Will Smith is actually old enough to play Uncle Phil
Still waiting for the reboot of stargate sg1
Nikita Dragun Kissed you like to undo.
I’d pay money to see the movie
Will should play the part of the father that comes back gets hope up and leaves.
PUT KELSEYS REAL CHANNEL IN PLEASEEEEEE
Who is that living plastic bea-oh shit it's Tricia Paytas.
Omg kelsie and chris in this video
Yes Kelsey's in this episode!

Wow, I had no idea YTers were such snobs about 'their' platform. Again, wow. EDIT: I wonder how these people feel about non-monetizing content creators.
Adults react to azzer hit rap songs and voice impressions 2
Now I kinda hope someone makes one of these about a cat-eating alien stuck on earth.
Thought the fan trailer was pretty cool, if it did lead to something I’d like to see it, but would really want to see a continuation of the original story with Will now in the mentor position that uncle Phil was to his character back in day.
Impressive
Please react to the IT chapter 2 trailer

If they turned a comedy show into a more darker show, how about turning a dark show into a comedy?
How do people like rug
Yeah yeah this is great, but Tim, where is your T-shirt from????
I've been praying this happens. With the trailer's cast.
Will smith as uncle Phil 👌🏻👌🏻
Not everything needs a remake or reboot, we have enough of that trash with disney right now. Leave Fresh prince as it is. 


Please react to IT chapter 2
I sold make another reaction to this video. Damn people are getting dumb.

Teens react to ksi new album new age
@FBE One day, in the future, movie companies like WB, FOX Search Light and other may be overtaken by YouTube and probably forgotten. Now that YouTube has Original Series n Movies and support creators who are not famous movie actors, time will come when it will be the biggest Movie/Series production company.

Pardon me if my grammar isn't great
First thing first Rest In Peace uncle phill
lol trisha here after getting exposed 💀
REACT TO THE WHOLE YOUTUBE DRAMA
React to IT chapter 2
It chapter 2 please
FBE: always bringing videos i didn't know existed to my attention. like that sonic trailer smh
I loved the trailer and actually saw it through Will SMith's channel.
I feel it's great the 2 worlds are meshing and as long as the latter doesn't overtake the former then we can all exist in the YouTube space.
Plz react to stray kids
Plz react to stray kids
Now get will smith to react to this
I feel like this video was waaaay too long. They could have stopped after the questions that didn’t refer to the videos they reacted to themselves and not go on another “traditional celebrity v YouTube celebrity” tangent like it seems like they’re doing a lot lately. If you wanna have that debate that’s fine, but I feel like that debate happens too much in fbe vids lately
the original already covered darker themes and  real subject matter. if anything doesnt need a shitty teeny bopper "the wb" style shit drama remake, it's fresh prince.
IT chapter 2
Did Tim quote J.Cole by accident lol"First things first, rest in peace uncle phil"

It took me like 3 times watching this, but they did the hand snap and IMPROVED on it too.... the iconic Prince/Jazzy Jeff hand snap, you know the one.
8:02 "You can take something original and just flip it upside down"...yeah, yeah, but maybe more like flipped-turned upside down, right? RIGHT?
If these celebs treat YouTube as YouTube then we'll welcome them into the community.
React it chapter 2

Please do not feature Trisha Paytas again. Her content, especially on Instagram and Patreon, is not a positive influence for young audiences (particularly young girls) which the majority of her and your audience is.
Sup bro
Bel air should happen
Fuck, someone needs to make this shit for real!
The power of YouTube is so magical....

This shit just looks like another generic straight to dvd film that you would find in a bargain bin. U dont fuck with the O.G show. There r some things that u should leave well enough alone, and TPPOBA is one of them.

heads up, the perfect woman coming in hot at 0:20
Skipping whole episode bc Trish
FBE please make a series of “People react to Music from around The world”. I notice that there’s a lot of countries (like mine) that feel left out, so i think that it would be great if they show them some original singers from each country (not only Korea and not Latin Music as a whole).
In my case i would be glad to see them react to music from Spain (not only recent but the most popular ones)

Pros: a better way to learn from each country
Cons: a lot of research work
Timothy has the right attitude. Always think of abundance, not of a fearful scarcity.
Trisha shouldn't be in the video
I think y’all should react to boy Pablo! They have good music btw and they r an underrated group that people should listen to :)
Yeesh!
Bro fuck Trisha 🗑 she alway saying some bad influence in vids get her out of here

Ya'll really added some controversial YouTubers in here... 🙄
I feel like if EditingIsEverything was involved, it would involve the right clips from "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" with the right tone to it to have that same drama. You know what I mean?
Sorry YouTube IF this were to happen, it would be on Netflix, it has way more online streaming and is far cheaper then YouTube. Hate to say it but it's the truth, they will get the budget, unlimited with Netflix rather then YouTube
LMAO come on this try hard attempt won't come close to the original. Hollywood needs to get better. This ridiculous attempt to make the original show some half assed drama is ridiculous.

YouTube has alway been one my favorite source of content. Everyone should see YouTube as legit platform. I think Will Smith’s should fund the movie .
I really think this highlights some of the conversations that were not okay to have at the time. It's a classic show with a ton of undertones that weren't okay to bring to light at the time.

The Completionist should be in more of these videos. I really like his reactions.
As someone who literally just finished rewatching the "What if Point Break reboot Was Directed by [name]" series by PatrickHWillems so, I'm just like "HELL YEAH, LET'S DO THIS!"
I think that they did it justice I hope that they actually make a reboot of it
I feel like some of the YouTubers who reacted to this weren’t the right ones... some of them hadn’t seen the show, weren’t enthusiastic. Someone literally said “Oh look, it’s the guy from the show!” about Will Smith. One of the biggest actors in the world. Wow.
Weird.. I watched fresh prince of bel air a few days ago and now this . 





yo if I watch gravity falls again, will it come back?
youtubers love to toot their own horn. i really hate what youtube has become
WHY IS THE MANATEE IN THIS?
Lol everyone wants trisha out but she's the reason I'm here cuz she's the only interesting thing anout this video and I don't even like her 😂
Is that Trisha? I can't recognize her. She looks different in her photos.
Maybe will should make a reboot of him being a dad on uncle Phil level raising his kids to be better than he and his friends were.
Please don’t bring Trisha back
I can get down with every reboot except this I hope this don’t become a thing ,the show raised a lot of us I can’t handle a remake of this

I'd definitely say have college kids and/or adults react to Joyner Lucas's "Devil's Work", it'd be a very interesting video and discussion about what they think about it.
Why is everyone hating on Trisha so much!?!?!?!?!?!?
Idk a dramatic version of Bel-Air may be kinda cool
lol yall gotta have Tim in this one. It just wouldn't make sense not to.
It isn't as good as the original but I still wanna watch it just for the interest of how they are gonna make the show into one film
To bad they not even mention Brendon Urie being on another platform instead of Youtube.
Ew Nikita why

Its fire!
You know one of the questions that should have been asked is do you fear for the platform with so many celebrities coming over it only being a matter of time before YouTube becomes more of a corporate thing and Hollywood takes over YouTube.
(This comment phrased liked I'm a reactor)

First reaction: alright, that's pretty cool. One of my fave things to look at (when I can find them) is, uh, recut trailers....you know, trailers for movies that have been put back together in a different way...like a dramatic horror Mrs. Doubtfire.

Second reaction: Wait, that's only fan made? Aw, man....I was hoping this could be a full series...or at least a YouTube movie

Third reaction: Yeah...wow, man. Had no idea about his friends and all, but...man, that makes sense. Oh, please fund this, Will...go patreon or whatever, but just make it happen in some form.

QUESTIONS
-So impressive as a trailer. The story is exactly the same, but it's in a dramatic....or not even dramatic, just a real tone. I could see it as a launch for a real project.

-That's so cool that Will saw it. It....I mean, whenever a celebrity likes and retweets something I wrote, it blows my mind, so Will seeing and getting behind this project inspired by his project is just amazing and really speaks to the power of the internet and YouTube.

-Five million, that's cool. It's 😊 it's not as many as some but it's a pretty good amount for someone who's been doing it as long as he has.

-it's cool. It's really just one more way for celebs to interact with us. First it was comic-con, then Facebook, then twitter. Interaction evolution, man, that's it.

-Sure they are. I mean, it's their own category of YouTuber, like gamers and vloggers and musicians. They do have a preexisting fanbase, so that makes it a little different for them, since they don't need to work as hard for subscribers, or fans, but so long as they behave as good as any other YouTuber with a heart and mind should and they don't get cocky, then hey, come on in. We're, uh....we welcome you. Just be nice and don't get clickbaity.

This episode is so badly done...none of them have an idea of what camp even is..really dissapointed😥
did one of them really put Ezra next to harrys look pfft none of them understood what camp meant i gtg

pls say queen Zendaya's name correctly its zen-day-ah lol
12:03 give this girl a slap in th head :)
0:35 Did he actually said "Metropolan Museum of Arts"?
No...just no
Majority of them literally have no idea what Camp means so seeing them judge this is very very painful. Like I’m literally screaming at my phone right now because they have no clue what they’re talking about. I’m sorry but they have no room to be judging the Met Gala because for one they don’t even clearly understand the theme except for one person and two if your not truly into fashion the outfits aren’t going to make sense.
Where's Nicki???
Adults reacts 88rising Niki
Malfoy confuses me with his opinions
Smh they be disrespecting Gaga like that 😩😩

Jeanie looks so good in this episode
You go Jeanie 😍😍😍
this is some pretty ritualistic shit, if the elites dress weird in the bohemian groove, it aint no shock they finance these weird events to display symbology
I really didn’t love this video. It frustrating. Why u hatin on zendaya and lady Gaga? I’m sorry...can u do better?
thank you for appreciating Ezra Miller, like..damn, that was A LOOK
If they only knew that cardi’s so called “gorgeous gown” costed thousands of dead birds feathers*sigh*
What's with the lady in white? According to her NOBODY fitted the theme... uuummm DO YOUR RESEARCH
Lol asking people that clearly don’t know about fashion (historically) about fashion. 💀 hate to see it
They really needed to show a video for Gaga. The camp was not necessarily in the clothes but in the presentation of them!
I’m sad that only one understands Gaga’s story behind her style.. for me.. ITS THE WHOLE THEME! I MEAN HONESTLY I THINK EVEN MAMA RUPAUL GAGGED WHEN SHE SAW GAGA !
Where's Priyanka?
Harry’s look wasn’t even that great 
£20 blouse from Topshop yes ma’am
I really can't believe they put Harry over Lupita like he looks pretty but that's not what camp is about
The person who said PURRRRFECT is everything.
where is janelle monae??!!
UMMMM EXCUSE YOU BUT IT 👏IS👏zenDAYa👏👏 NOT zenDIEa COME ON NOW YALL SHOULD KNOW THIS BY NOW😑smh

That tier systems been around for over a decade in 100's of video games.  But sure it's "new" lol
To be honest I never understood this shit. They look ridiculous to me its just plainly AWFUL besides wasnt King LAY from EXO attending this stupid gala why wasnt ge mentioned??
this video bothers me so much. i really wish you educated these reactors a little more about what camp actually is, because i'm not sure any of them completely understood the concept. read some excerpts from susan sontag's essay, notes on camp. provide some examples of outfits that have been deemed camp. i just really wish the reactors that did this understood what they were judging. it frustrated me a lot watching them say "that's not camp" to outfits that were rated in the top five met gala outfits in vogue and many other big name magazines. i'm really not trying to be rude or over-critical, but it would be awesome if better definitions and examples were given to the reactors next time a video involves such a widely misunderstood concept.
lmao they literally dont know what the f*ck they were talking about it was so funny and frustrating to watch
People please educate yourselves into what Camp actually is. Thank you
How could they do Lady Gaga like that tho
how the fuck is gaga not an S i blame it on whoever produced this because they didnt see the performance.
Its ok, we have opinions
but next time, before you throw some shit, educate yourself first.
Its not fair that they only given a very narrow definition of camp, these people have no idea what they are talking about!
honestly the straights are put of control again. do not bring people that probably had to google camp before they watched the met gala or thought that camp meant camping outfits lol so that next time we‘ll actually have people that know what they are talking about lmaoo
I think only 1 or 2 of the reactors actually understood what camp is.
I would have liked to see how they averaged after everyone had voted. If you do one of these again, can we get the overall average?
PLEASE REACT TO SEVENTEEN!!!!
Y'all should have shown them clips from Gaga's performance. I don't know what that woman was thinking when she said Gaga wasn't camp, but maybe if she saw the theatrics behind the reveals, she'd see the light.
Gaga was serving CAMP performance. not Camp outfit
Gaga is literally the defenition of camp... If she wasn't camp then nobody was she knows exactly what it means DJJDJDJDKJD
Being camp isn't about being PRETTY
Fire that btch who calls herself Ribonucleic Acid
RNA... Isn't into real fashion, just the common "this is pretty" style... So we can't really blame her for not understanding CAMP
Kristin totally gets it. 
RNA I'm glad we've never met and I hope it stays that way.
React to game of thrones 8x05
All these comments saying the reactors dont know camp... Boi, this is first time even hearing about camp😂
I'm just here for Lady Gaga and Billy Porter
Sweetie Gaga is the CAMP,,, Y'all don't understand what camp means and it shows yikes
The girl that said lady gaga wasnt camp clearly doesnt even know what camp is lmao
Gaga I’m so sorry sweetie
HOW THE HECK DOES LADY GAGA DOESN’T FIT THE THEME??? I MEAN GAGA HERSELF IS A LIVING CAMP SINCE HER DEBUT IN 2008. HER WHOLE CAREER IS CAMPY AND EXTRA. HER OPINION IS JUST WRONG.
Gaga sweetie I'm so sorry
they don't fully understand what camp is
Necesito subtítulos en Español
The white haired person is a girl or a boy??
They all have no idea what camp is
I just came here to say that Kim K's dress literally looked like a used condom.

Gaga doesn't fit the theme??????????? EXCUSE ME ?????
Need to slap that girl.
Yea I'm going back to Nigeria......
AUHHHM TBH RNA , I WILL PUT YOU ON TRASH RANK BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOTHING! ALSO I THINK YOU HAVE  AN EXTRA CHROMOSOMES HUNNY~ 

YOU DON'T FIT TO OTHER REACTOR SO I PUT YOU ON TRASH RANK SIS!
For those who didn't put gaga at Super . Sorry but WTF . Do u even know what is Camp? Well let me answer u . SHE IS CAMP . SHE = GAGA . 
Bye.
Did Miss girl who was wearing an Ann-Taylor grandma blouse just say that Gaga didn’t fit the theme?? Ma’am Gaga IS camp. She isn’t just peeling her clothes off. It was a performance. Maybe do your research before trying to tell GAGA what camp means.
its a real shame that they dont seem to fully understand camp :/
How the fuck? Lady Gaga literally helped curate the gala. She embodies the theme.
I’m screaming at them saying Gaga didn’t fit the theme...the actual clownery
How the hell do you put katy perry next  to Billy porter..
People who say Lady Gaga didn't fit the theme don't understand what camp means
Ezra 🔥
Like to slap that girl that doesn't compliment gaga..
Sooooo can this video be redone. Maybe show your cast pictures of ‘camp’ fashion and then let them redo this because there was only two people that somewhat understood what camp fashion is and the rest didn’t even try.
“She doesn’t fit the theme at all” shE WAS THE THEME, this girl doesn’t know what camp is 🙄🙄🙄
RNA obviously has no idea what the camp theme is really about
Cody Fern did the same thing harry did............ 


Except Cody put Harry to SHAME
Who is this fashionless girl right here
Gaga IS the camp
Did someone just say lady Gaga didn’t fit the theme? Oh wait I guess irrelevant false statements are being fed to me from Satan my bad👌
ADULTS REACT TO LIA MARIE JOHNSONS LIVE STREAMS YOU GUYS NEED TO MAKE SURE SHES OKAY
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE
I’m confused. I don’t find Harry’s outfit that amazing
Did that woman really just say that Gaga didn't fit the theme? GAGA?? the woman who has been doing camp for the past 10 years, was literally this year's hoast and one of the very few people who actually understood and explained what it was all about??? SHE OUT OF ALL PEOPLE DIDN'T FIT THE THEME ???? The disrespect.. I have to laugh
Adults should react to Garfield Gameboy'd Complete by Lumpy Touch.
Harry deserved all S
Gaga is the definition of Camp
Zendaya dress was everything top to bottom and that glass slipper iconic!
how are the picks stupid? they represent culture
The fact you didn’t have Janelle Monet (who happened to be best dressed to the theme) on your list bothers me
metro-poli-tan
Hahahah wtf is wrong with the people why do they do this?
RNA.. first of all obviously you have 0 clue what is camp really about. Watch Vogue's short documentary about Gaga's preparation for the Met Gala, there she will shortly explain that Camp is far more than just being extravegant and over-the-top. Or do some research... whatever. But remember that Lady Gaga's entrance at the Met Gala and the 4 outfits was named the most camp entrance and outfit by various fashion Magazines, fashion experts etc..inclusive  Vogue AND Vogue's Editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. So don't come and say that it didn't fit the theme, because it fit the theme more than anyone else's dress.  This was the first video I watched from FBE and thanks to you, also the last one. Camp should have been explained properly and than maybe you could have think about what you say a little bit more.
Gaga didn’t fit Camp theme? WTF?!
George’s comments made my day. He was so into it I loved it.
Personally I didn't care for the fashion. I don't know fashion that well. But it wasn't appealing to me. I liked some I hated some.
Only two knew what camp is. the rest of these peasants don’t know what camp is. They need to see the video of Gaga walking the carpet and of drag queens to understand what camp is.
RNA clearly does not understand what camp is.
thanks for hating every outfit RNA, we hate u too girl.
Couldn't even finish this video- like u drag GAGA and Lupita?????????? reallllly yall
lol California.
this video is full of shit
FBE should make another video only with Labib and RNA showing them the full video of GAGA on the red carpet, explaining better what Camp is and at the end see if they think the same or if they changed their mind.
this RNA girl is full of shit
Please have some of these reactors read Susan Sontag’s essay or at least understand what they’re going to see. My hand was itching the entire time watching them react
Y'all didn't even include Frank Ocean SMH 😤 😤
White shirt girl. Get out. imagine thinking Gaga isn’t camp AND disrespecting miss Lupita
Katy Perry was gorgeous
When your saying this person didn't fit the theme but also place lupita nyong last just cause it wasn't appealing to you OK SIS
Kasey Musgrave’s should have been on here. She was iconic.
These comments are gonna be harsh
It’s hard to not sound judgy... but maybe next time @FBE should find people who can actually appreciate fashion and know what they’re talking about. These people clearly do not know camp💁🏻‍♀️
RNA knows nothing
ezra goes for they/them pronouns
They just don't know what Camp is.
Girl, Gaga was the best of the night
What about the karjenners at the gala
Lady Gaga bored me at the MET gala
”Lady gaga does not fit the theme” SHE WAS ONE OF THE ONLY ONES TO FIT THE THEME GUUURL, do ur reading
Sorry but this video is a trash
Labib my love.
i chocked on my drink when the white shirt lady said lady gaga’s outfit(s) is like, not part of the theme.
they look like they are trying to be the Capital from Hunger Games
Wow, I don’t know who the hell that white shirt girl is. BUT, saying Gaga is not camp, you must live in Mars. Surely people will comment more like this, girl. Just wait. And by the way, camp is not only about over the top.
Zendaya (zen•day,uh)
12:04 GIRLLLLL! Wtf
(RNA)
other people: wow what a cool and unique name wonder what it means
me, a biology student: ribonucleic acid
This video was not it 😒like y’all should have got teens or something to react to this🙄
Yeah the girl in the white shirt has got to go somewhere 🙄😒
The first tier list was made straight up on my birthday yay I’m honored thanks for the adults react fact
Camp is NOT just being over the top, is having a reason. Everything about camp is about performing and having a concept for what you are actually wearing or doing. Every guest had to read an essay about notes on camp, actually STUDY the theme before choosing the outfit, and Gaga is the camp through and through.
Where is madison?? For these
Please do a blind side by side of the final rankings of things like this at the end.
Wow I didnt know I'd be so disappointed by this video.
I have little to no knowledge about fashion but I understood the theme and that white chick saying that Lady Gaga didnt fit the theme is like saying that Sushi isnt from Japan.
No offense but that's not even an opinion anymore, it's just wrong.
inhales BOI if u don’t get
ezra miller 😍
Girl in the white needs to go
“I don’t think she fits the theme at all” Gaga is literally all Camp most of the time wym... every single outfit was camp... the whole performance was camp go watch the video of her getting ready please
this video and the reactors made me stressed. this was frustrating to watch lol esp RNA
Loolz
12:05 i love him so much omg
tbh none of them deserved C or below.
well maybe I'd put harry at C but that's it. remember, there are men who showed up in plain or slightly bedazzled tuxes. at least he went for a more lacey look. I wish he did more considering that he was like the host or whatever
I'm sorry but the two people between 11:57 and 12:05 made me so frustrated all in 8 seconds 🙄🤦‍♀️
the head thing that leto did.. was it gucci or chanel? i forgot
Dudes, Moroccan weddings have the bride wear more than five dresses, lmao try harder Gaga
Yall should have shown videos of these outfits
These straight people don’t know what camp is lmao
" zenDIEa"
i think that in order to capture the essence of gaga’s looks, you have to see her go through all of her outfit changes. she put on such a performance, it was the definition of camp.
It’s ok to have wrong opinions.
Y’all are trippin Gaga is the epitome of camp
I need Rna to learn what camp is😬 putting lupita at F🙄
Sorry FBE you invited the wrong reactors
is no one gonna talk about the fact that brittany is wearing sisters apparel😪
PLS REACT TO STRAY KIDS
harry dressed the best. prove me wrong i dare you
what has idubbbz done to the tier list fad everyone's doing it jesus
Yall dont know shit bout the theme or fashion. Go die.
I’m a simple girl, I see Ezra, I click. 😌👌
This video gave me hives because these people clearly have no taste. Ezra and Billy are definitely S tier. Also, where is miss Janelle Monae? Cody Fern? Cara Delevingne? Priyanka? Florence Welch? HAMISH MF BOWLES!?!?!
OBVIOUSLY ZENDAYA OUTFIT WAS CAMP, C A M P
he said metropolin, not metropolitan >____>
RNA LOL
12:09 oh wow I love him!!! He honestly had the best rankings
Zendaya looks like she smells PATCHOULI OIL haha
I think the staff should have explained what the meaning of the theme first cause obviously some don't know.
They should look up what camp means before judging
The girl who put Lupita at F should be fired
Okay really buddy how you gonna say Zendaya like that smh
GAGA WAS THE QWEEN OF THE MET!
Those who think otherwise ,obviously didn’t watch the entire entrance and should watch her vogue video 🙄
Be more informed honey #METGAGA
Lady Gaga is the literal definition of camp. She shoulda got alllll the Ss man. They also shoulda showed the video of her entrance. IT WAS SO EXTRA AND IT GAVE ME LIFE.
Fashion from Met Gala but there's no Janelle Monae. This is a travesty
camp definition 


Camp is an aesthetic style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad taste and ironic value] Camp aesthetics disrupt many of modernism's notions of what art is and what can be classified as high art by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.


camp something considered amusing not because of its originality but because of its unoriginality. According to Susan Sontag, "The essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration And Camp is esoteric -- something of a private code, a badge of identity even.
4:45

THAT'S. WHAT. CAMP. IS. LADY.
Lady Gaga doesn’t fit the theme of camp, but wore 4 outfits. Harry Styles fits the theme tho. I am confusion. React EXPLAIN
the fact that they put harry’s outfit which is the most boring one at the top, shows how much they know nothing about camp
i see, none of them know nothing about camp
Did she just say that lady Gaga doesn’t fit camp or am I tripping
I don’t know what their problem is but are they assuming that camp is just Hallowe’en themed in the middle of the year?
Love Brit's new hair!
Met Gala = Celebreties version of Halloween
It’s official. All of California has horrible taste. These are all awful! Except Zendaya. She would get the D. 😉
1:14 Zen-Die-Ya 💀
Some of them didn’t even know/understand what CAMP was ☠️✋🏽
I likes cardis but its ends look like rugs kind just me?
Um...no. There should definitely have been more research and a deeper explanation of what camp is. The fact that Billy Porter wasn't automatically in every one's S-tier is incredibly telling of whether your guests even understand what they're talking about. When you decide to host discussions on cultural elements that are deeply important to specific groups, especially marginalized groups, you gotta be careful about who even gets to criticize/rank them, otherwise it's just a slap in the face and your viewers learn very little.
lady gaga literally defined camp, yall let these locals in forever 21 and h&m rate camp looks. mess.
?!?!?!?!? Most these people don’t know wtf camp is. Smh
i would die for ezra miller
Gaga could’ve worn almost anything and it would’ve been camp because she herself IS camp
The producers and half of the reactors don't know shit about camp,,, I am disappointed
@12:31 sis how does LADY GAGA not fit the theme , she IS the theme TF? 😂
Did he just say the “metropolan”
Oh gosh they don’t know shit about camp 😐
on what earth does harry styles's look make the top 9 or even breach the top 30
Lady Gaga is literally the definition of camp
It’s not ZenDIEya it’s ZenDAYa
Half the people reacting had absolutely no idea what “Camp” is and it shows......
Is it bad that I clicked on this video just to see Harry Styles
does Rna understand what camp is......
Most of them had no idea what the hell they were talking about.
straight people don't understand camp
Jeffery Lamar Williams (Young Thug) Started this trend and everyone attacked him, now everyone is wearing a dress
This is educational bc I didn’t know what camp was not I do.#learningbecomingsmart
I don’t agree with a few of their opinions. But I do appreciate most of who’s opinions mean something
zen die ya
“zEn-DiE-yA”
lupita was robbed
The girl in white , sis - get some help
Zen-die-a!?😂
Some of these straights saying ”that’s not camp” clearly don’t know what camp is
Some of these people doesn’t know what cam is. The meaning of cam is to stand out have an performance and to be the master piece.
just came to make sure nobody was putting down Harry because me and the rest of the Directioners would’ve kicked their butts
Lmao, they don't know what the fuck camp is🙄😂 and they don't realize camp is also the presentation and execution
Do 👏🏼 these 👏🏼 people 👏🏼 understand 👏🏼 what 👏🏼 camp 👏🏼 means 👏🏼
Where's Janelle Monae!?
“zen die uh”
I adore Ezra Miller 
Kay thanks bye
5:17 it's called camp sis
w h y are they saying zendaya like that
some of these people are slow omg 💀
Most people dont understand "camp"
They should have shown Gaga's whole performance on the carpet.  It was 100% Camp.
I wish Lucas was a part of this episode.
i think they should get educated before they film, who are they to say whats is the theme
Who ever doesn’t think lady gaga fits the theme is a joke
Just came to see harry
Your telling me four different outfits Isn’t over the top? I think so 🤨
how are u just not going to define camp/ provide context or explain its origins... so embarrassing on the producers behalf.
Gaga and billy potter were mom and dad of met 2019
Zendaya was my fav🔥❤️
A feel embarrassed for the people that said Gaga didn’t fit the theme or that it wasn’t special... 👀
I'm so fucking proud of harry hosting the met gala, and how he always wears what he loves and just don't give a damn about others opinion, plus his outfit really fits the theme! He looked so handsome and good and different like his outfit is something new I fucking love it.
Half of them don’t even know what camp is.
why put people who know nothing about CAMP? at least first explain it to them or something. like RNA did not know ANYTHING about camp at all wth
ive said this a thousand times but here we go again, harrys outfit was awesome. just not for the met gala.
Fue keeps getting sicker, 2019, radical changes 😞😤
I agree with the one say Gaga just a peel of dress. Nothin special. The dress itself quite basic. But i agree the attitude is extra, quite a camp. But the final outfit?? Nah... basic at stripper club.
I feel like a bunch of people didn't understand what camp actually is

Literally no one except the guy with the slicked white hair understands what camp is and it really shows... most of them have pretty shitty ratings and they are just rating based off of how interested they are in it/ if it looks good to them and not how camp an outfit actually is.
No offence that Kristin is a bish
Well... they’re wrong
OML they way the say zendaya hurts
Lupita and Gaga were the best from this list!

who the hell 
does miss RNA think she is !
the reactions to harry styles vs jared leto are so confusing to me like harry just borrowed his grandmas' blouse that's not fuckin camp and yet jared shows up in a victorian red dress carrying his head and they're like,, hm he could have done better...
These tier lists are BUSTED
just came here to see if Harry was being mentioned I'm not gonna lie
Litterly WHAT THE FUCK why wasn't gaga on super these people have NO TASTE
These mf don't know shit about fashion and it's showing argh
I can see how tasteless they aaaare
I don’t think the ppl in the video understand camp like at all ??
THERE'S NO FLAVOUR
me vs getting mad at everyone's comments and rankings
As crazy as it is, I will never understand the point of the Met Gala.
Their reactions to Jared lotto got me mad
Dumbest video you guys have posted.
React to ITZY "Dalla Dalla".
I think Lady Gaga should be at the TOP. Cause she understands what CAMP really is.
I was very interested to see what they said considering MOST of them know nothing about fashion
12:02 an I oop...
"I dont think gaga fits the theme" my ass. Youre fucking kidding me right
12:01 omg she's the worst. You guys should really consider putting another reactor. Seriuosly
Straight women call Harry's basic blouse creative. Stay in your lane lol
Where is Janell Monae!!?
yawnz Claire Danes already done that light up dress none of them seem to know that
Should’ve shown Kanye’s and Frank Ocean’s. I personally love the irony and how different their outfits were compared to everyone else’s.
why are the reactors being so tasteless? they should've invited people who are into fashion and then let them evaluate the freaking masterpieces.


not hating, just sayin'
when you get together a  bunch of straight people to judge camp. Yall this hurt my head. Especially at the lady who put harry ontop of zendya and lupita. Labib was the only decent one that got the theme of it having to be  extra
Zen-die-aaa
12:02 she had the audacity to-
what the fuck is going on here on this day
TASTELESS💀
tasteless

Why are straight people judging camp outfits?!
"Gaga doesnt fit the theme" 
"Gagas look wasnt as good as Katys"


Let's all out this into perspective. The theme was CAMP. Picked by Gaga and Styles. I'm pretty sure a GIANT PINK CAPE DRESS THAT TRANSFORMED INTO OTHER DRESSES is more worthy than Harry styles ruffle shirt. Ya'll need some education.
So like everyone apriciates harry(it wasnt that good) but like jared wasnt original?????
react to pennywise it trailer pleaseee
Electric chair
„I dont think that Gaga fits the theme” W T F
Harry high, jared low, choices..
“Zendaya doesn’t fit the theme” you don’t fuckin see any ordinary person walking down the street in big ball dresses that light up like they’re Cinderella. It’s CAMP!
Did anyone catch that double standard with Leto and Harry Styles??? Like why does Harry Styles get a pat on the back for wearing a sheer romper but Jared Leto didn't do enough??? I'm sorry, I love Harry, but that was the bare minimum and he's getting all this praise. Men need to step it up when they dress themselves. Billy Porter and Ezra Miller are the example all men should do. 

(absolutely no offense meant to any of the reactors, I just have a difference in opinion with most of them and that's ok)
I wanted to see those guys how they would react to Priyanka Chopra
They need to get told off for their misjudgement on the theme. It's not fun when they don't have an actual rank.
Saying Gaga didn't fit the theme is so wrong and undeserving. Show video footage next time. And better pictures for Zendaya and Katy Perry
the tasteless………
12:33 the foolishness. Gaga literally was camp on the carpet. The dress didn't necessarily have to be camp because she literally embodied camp in her attitude.
What app where they using?
THIS IS SO DISSAPOINTING
Lets not forget about Nico Tortorella, that was camp AF 🔥
Lol this is fashion?
Why are straight judging camp outfits?

GOD I WISH WE COULD GIVE ANYONE JUDGING LOOKS FITTING THE THEME OF CAMP A CRASH COURSE SO THEY AT LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL CAMP IS!!! SOMETIMES CAMPINESS DOESNT HAVE TO BE RIDICULOUS NOR DOES THE OUTFIT HAVE TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND APPEALING!!!
SOOOO MANY PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND CAMP!! Not thinking a full on Cinderella transformation performance including a left behind glass slipper is camp IS JUST A CRIMEEEEE!!!!!!

Am I the only one who DIDN’T like Harry’s outfit..? I see what he was going for & respect it, but it ain’t it for me. His boldness & confidence is amazing though, I will say.
he deadass said metropolitan wrong?
so many of them didn’t understand camp at all sksk
Some of those people have absolutely no idea what they are talking about.. it hurts

Thank you brandon, for understanding wtf the gala is and what its meant to be 😂
Is not the most camp thing but i loved Harry's outfit
Harry got ranked higher than jared leto..y’all wildin out here
This is your worst reaction video. They don't know the theme. Lady Gaga doesn't have a performance video. They made nonsensical ratings.
Zen DIE a, REALLY?! It’s Zen DAY a 😑🤦🏻‍♀️.
Gaga literally IS the definition of CAMP. Just watch her whole backstage video at the MET gala getting ready and for sure you’ll all change your opinions, she really thought this out. Really researched her craft. She never does anything half assed. Plus, the whole PERFORMANCE of her changing outfits was CAMP. Y’all should’ve shown the video instead of just the pictures. The performance and the whole extraness of it was what made her entrance so entrancing.
a lot of them were saying the outfits were to much but.... did they... hear the theme or......... ??
React to Tati’s BYE SISTER 👋🏽
I'm not sure RNA understood that she was grading on how much the fits matched the theme. She was more so grading on how much she personally liked the dress, and only the dress, no hate this is something I could be wrong about.
Adults react to youtube rewind but it’s actually good
Can you play clicked tale
Jeanie is the Paula Abdul of the react cast

These pictures are assss, they didn’t show Ezra miller’s train, Billy porter’s wings, how long Gaga’s train was..
Rank billboard award performances
ezra miller actually doesn't identify neither as a man nor as a woman please don't misgender people!
RNA is a type of friend who has a big mouth and always being negative towards eeeveeryyythinggg.
The only thing that Lady Gaga should get is "S". That's it.
Fire Rna like her opinions is dumb and she doesn't know anything about fashion look at her clothes like seriously 🙄
What's with guys wearing dresses now? Wtf
Wtf. She didn't know the theme? She was the only camp on the carpet wtf! She gave theatrics, drag queen style, the origin of camp. Camp may be over the top, but it's beneath it that matters. The costume is one thing, but true camp is not taking everything too serious which Gaga did.
Anyone else notice that almost all of these designs confuse Camp with Surrealism?
i DoNt tHinK shE fiTs thE ThEmE at aLL

imagine saying that to lady gaga who researched and understands the theme
Did this dude just rate Katy perry over zendaya-
Stop misgendering Ezra ffs

(Not hate, love ya Brandon)
Gaga is the definition of camp
"I don't think she fit the theme" someone doesn't understand the theme. Lady Gaga is basically the definition of camp
This looks like the YouTuber gloom’s video but not trying to say anything
la que dice que Gaga no va con el tema JAJAJSJAJHAJ GUUUURL BYE
none of them know what camp is huh?
Abit early for halloween isent it ?
Nicki, Zendaya, and Gaga
lady gaga's performance on the red carpet was the definition of camp what are yall ON
Jeannie looks absolutely Beautiful.
Did no one talk about Cam Newton?
can you guys react to ‘The Kings’ performance compilation or performances from World Of Dance 2019??
Please do a try not to laugh whose line is it anyway edition!!!!
Gaga deserved better. They really don’t know what camp is. She had a A+ performance art fashion.
Did he say "Metropilan"?
The way lady Gaga displayed the outfits was truly the definition of camp because the idea Is for you to be camp be dramatic over the top !  the outfit won’t prove anything
I got hellaaaaa offended when Zendaya was so low
React to Pearl Jam
a bunch of ppl that don’t know what camp is ranking the level a camp of other ppls fashion lmaoo
Just saw the first seconds and I'm offended cause Harry Styles was fabulous 🙄 i don't even wanna watch the whole thing
Make the reactors react to other reactor
I hate how all of these reactors have no sense of fashion shm😭
un-tapped content would be - React to Kurt Nilsen (winner of world Idol, the only winner of world Idol ever)

Bruh they all shyed away from the topic it’s not about lookin good like if u do hey great for you even better but it’s about the outfit being so over the top smh
PUTTING ZENDAYA BELOW S? Y’ALL HAVE NO TASTE
Kids react to Denis daily pls
Jeannie looks gorgeous 💖😍💖
Next year I would like everyone to stay on topic

Edit: I know this is their opinion but... some people opinions were absolute trash.
Thanks for featuring TierMaker! Can't wait to see what you rank next.
can you react to Icelandic rap?
Lady Gaga- S
On the ranking level, I mostly relate with Mike, I mean none of them deserved below B or even A, each one had an outfit with a very different sensibility and you just have to catch it
When did literally everyone become an expert on camp?
“She had 10 wHoLe people?”
No she just had the arms of them 😂
you guys do know camp has only one description right? camp is being OVER THE TOP, being EXTRA, giving A SHOW. camp is so much more than just a fashion style and thats what camp is all about. everyone can have different opinions on what's extra but the second someone is really wearing something camp (and you understand what camp is) you KNOW thats camp
These people have no sense of fashion. I wanted to reach through the screen and smack one of them. Don’t speak on fashion if you don’t even know what you’re talking about.
I still don’t understand the concept of camp. Camp is going camping or church camp
The people who truly knew fashion have respected the small details and references while the simpletons just wanted an exaggerated look
tell me that girl ain't wearin a sisters hoodie lmaooooo
should’ve shown the whole Zendaya video
Ok, RNA has no idea what camp is...
No one in this video knows a thing about camp.
Harry Styles is the only one who kept the theme of camp and didn’t overdo with extravagance. He looks like a real prince 👑
They almost all have terrible taste, it looks like they didn’t understand the theme (especially RNA, she sounds stupid)
To appreciate Gaga carpet walk and look they would have had to see the actual video of it to make you really appreciate her looks it was not only awesome looks but it’ was a performance as well it was one of the best of alll Timez 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I'm sorry but who is zendiya
I only know zendaya
I love Zen-day-a not Zen-diy-a. 


This is not a hate comment but it really made me feel uncomfortable how he said her name
RNA looks like Hannah from until dawn 👀

React to it chapter 2 trailer
"Zendiya"
Why are you guys trying to decide what's camp and what's not? Everyone saw camp in different perspectives…
Dude why is brandon so attractive? ok guys Thats my future husband right there.
Nope
This was so frustrating to watch. I cant wait till the gala blows over and people who know nothing about camp can stop deciding what is and isnt camp. Ugh.
you guys should've mentioned the story behind zendayas outfit and the fact that she dropped the glass slipper on the stairs and at the end of the night she changed into a simple pink dress just like cinderella
Im sorry but does RNA like anything like?
Gaga is literally the definition of camp and for them to say that she didn't follow the theme...the disrespect

“He looks like he’s churning butter, but... for somebody’s funeral.” 😂😂
Redefined camp should just be called americamp.
You should have had them watch the actual video because the theatrics were part of the look... the camp was in the theatrics. You also didn't show Billy's wings.
The feminine dude reminds me of Brie Larson lol.
camp is much more than "being extra" or exaggerated, this is just a part of the meaning of camp. read more about it

Wtf is going on Gaga fits the theme peefectly
ZENDIYA?
lmao gaga's life is camp, to say she's not camp is insane
Cool, now let's hope the popularity of tier voting leads to it being used for things that actually matter. Like elections.

P.S. Look up STAR voting and support it.
Totally Agreed With Rna for just about all her answers.
HARRY IS MY FREAKING QUEEN
imagine thinking Gaga doesn't fit the camp theme lol
Why are they criticizing Zendaya’s outfit? Just leave her alone and let her do whatever the hell she wants!!
That guy with the eyes is the flash..
It's unfair that they showed a video for zendaya who provided a performance to light up her dress, but they didn't show a video for gaga who ALSO did a performance (she even had like 4 back up dancers) while changing into her different outfits. also i don't understand how some could put harry above jared leto just because harry wore a sheer top while leto was freaking carrying around his own head, imo that seems more camp. then again, all of this is subjective, so whatever
did this dude really call zendaya, zenDIEah
Lady Gaga didn't fit the theme 😂 seriously girl maybe you dont understand the word CAMP
They literally put Cardi's period dress above Gaga's iconic one🤢🤢

I'm mad at the lack of Darren Criss, who was the only cis/het male who actually got the theme. Harry Styles literally just wore a frilly shirt and heels. Wtf
some of these ppl have no idea what camp is and it’s sad.
You should do adults react to the new chapter two trailer
Can you guys react to power is power
That's just painfull to watch
I honestly don’t see the Camp in Harry’s look.
Just because you’re a man wearing a shirt with ruffles, it doesn’t make it Camp; Billy porter literally wore f****ing wings!



Also you can’t really critique Gaga’s looks without seeing video, the whole performance was the definition of Camp.
I’m glad most of them liked Harry’s look 😃
The fuck is this shit. F tier every single one but Zendaya
That girl saying Lady Gaga didn't fit the theme is SO DUMB. SHE WAS THE EMBODIMENT OF CAMP
Imagine thinking Lady Gaga isn't CAMP... girl... seriously? She breathes camp!

Godammit stop changing the background it’s making me uncomfortable
first up is zen die ah
seriously, they did not even understand the theme. It supposed to be camp not just pretty.
The locals not understanding the theme..smh
If Zendaya looking like Cinderella & getting a dress made that was mostly mechanic so it little up blue and expands and then having a fairy godbrother with a wand that omits smoke and a pumpkin carriage purse AND THEN LEAVING HER FUCKING GLASS SLIPPER ON THE FUCKING CARPET WASNT OVER THE TOP THEN WTF IS!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!??!??!!
y’all can SEE the difference between these generations!!

Hey react to IT 2 Trailer
harry styles had a hideous outfit and was NOT CAMP. these people have no clue about fashion my god
yea sis in the white and some of the others don’t know what camp means🤦🏾‍♀️
Harry Styles was not very crazy or theme fitting but I still love him lol
I love this channel but it feels like they’re mostly going by what they like instead of by the theme like I’m not the biggest fan of the chandelier but it was way over the top like its supposed to be
The video length is 13:29
12.04 "she's very pretty, but to me she doesn't fit the theme" 
Gurl, honey, sweetie, you don't even know CAMP means, you don't have the range to rate/judge Queen Gaga. She's the Camp embodiment .
WHERE IS RUPAUL.
they are clueless in fashion. omg.
Where's Tom?
as a fashion student myself I could tell how clueless these people are to fashion🙄 they don’t even know what camp is🤦🏻‍♀️
ZendAAya  sheeeeeshhh
Lady Gaga didn't fit the team? B Y E !
11:59 "She's peeling off clothes, that's it to me" Honey, understand the theme first and what Camp means before you call it just peeling off clothes. She bought theatrics , she bought performance, she brought CAMP.
The way they put Harry Styles so high when he had the most boring outfiy by far 💀
🤔
Gaga, we're so sorry
This video is an abomination of all the MET Gala Reaction videos. And the aggressive dumb energy on not understanding what even CAMP means is insulting. Please, you shouldn't have. 
Maybe you should have researched and told the reviewers what CAMP even means from Notes on Camp by Susan Sontag. Camp isn't just being over the top and extra. There's way more to it than that. 
Don't just do reaction videos for the sake of doing them.
i hit the space bar so hard when  that girl said Lady Gaga's outfit didn't fit the theme!!!!!!! gurl wat!

What about Nicki??
Gaga's vision of camp wasn't the clothes, it was the performance, it was taking 15 minutes for a red carpet, walk up and down the stars, it was being on the floor while showing her ass, it was opening umbrellas inside.
Lady Gaga is the QUEEN of camp, nobody can represent it like her.

They don't even explain that the whole red carpet of Gaga is an ACTUAL PERFORMANCE 15 minutes is an performance sorry hunnie eerr they don't have taste
Lady gaga was lazy , predictable and typical and just purely lazy and not trying.

Looking at her previous record and her impact at camp fashion, this was the.most basic camp look probably of the entire night - all 4 of her looks were basic af.

Soo disappointed , others actually tried you know - unlike her.
Half of these jokers don't know what camp is

GUYS ZENDAYA WON IT AND THATS ALL
A lot of them was really confused
Okay you guys should've elaborated more on the explanation of the Camp theme because most of these reactors don't really understand it and just looks at the outfits and judge them by their 'over the top'-ness which does not explain Camp fully.


I mean Lady Gaga is the co-chair of this year's MET she's def. the embodiment of CAMP
They do know how many birds- ok
brown guy with beard is cute ☺️
GAGA LITERALLY CAME EMBODIED IN CAMP THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAMP IS BYE

Lady Gaga didn't give a whole 16 minute CAMP PERFORMANCE for yall to say she wasnt on theme or was boring... please get the fuck out of my face! if you wanted her to be more extra with the outfit just look at the things she wore 3-4 years ago. this red carpet wasnt focused on her dresses, but on the actual performance. it was wrong to have just shown them the pics, you should've made them watch the video and had a better explanation of what CAMP really is...s m h

these people don't understand what camp is then say "i didn't think it fit the theme" like how the hell would you know if it fits the theme if you yourself don't know what camp even means?

And they still say her name wrong lol 1:13

These people don't know what camp is!!!! You could have explained to them what camp is in a little more detail and it would have been fun to watch. Right now it's just painful.

How could you guys miss Priyanka Chopra Jonas? Her outfit was the best according to the theme.
We want more People of colour , we don't feel represented FBE . Hope you guys don't just ignore People who aren't as famous in Hollywood.

Let them play world war Z !
the girl who kept said zendaya and lady Gaga weren’t on theme doesn’t understand what camp is
I wished I looked like a unicorn humming bird. That’s sounds like the most beautiful pure creature in the world.

Locals. „She didn’t fit the theme“, says a woman who never read „Notes on Camp“ Gaga is literally definition of Camp.
Pls react to NAV!!!!! He’s fire 🔥 and dropped his new album like a month ago. Also listen to his older songs from NAV and Perfect timing
You don't understand the Camp. Lady Gaga fits the theme the most. She is the Queen of Camp. She is the one who understands it. Read the essay Camp:notes on fashion by Susan Sontag
Please please please do a reaction to the new joker trailer

You react to this garbage but not something like Devil's Work by Joyner
some of them don’t know what CAMP means and it shows
So basically... a bunch of ppl who have know ideia what the Met Gala is about and didn’t get the meaning of “CAMP” at all
YO, i agree about how FBE should have educated them about what 'CAMP' is before making them rate.
They left out so many great outfits 🙄
My favorite were Lady Gaga, Billy Porter, Harry Styles, and Lupita Nyong'o.
They dont undertstand the Theme..
Lol so many people who “didn’t think they fit the theme” really don’t know what camp is. yikes.
pink carpet ** not red... and also, to the ones that said Gaga didn't fit the theme, you clearly don't know what camp is...
Try to watch Vogue's get ready with Lady Gaga. Maybe you'll be educated with what 'Camp' really is.
Hoooow is Kacey Musgraves not on here?!??!?

Disappointed how they did not educate the reactors or the reactors did not educate themselves on the true meaning of camp. Shame. Since you're a react channel atleast get your facts straight. Not just react to what you know because you're giving people wrong outlooks.
Im sad at how WRONG they are

You should have added a thorough analysis of camp because literally Susan Sontag's essay is a fucking list.
If this is fashion
Then that Apple styrofoam thingy put on my arm is fashion
This is when the React channel NEEDS a guest drag queen to help educate their regulars on the meaning of CAMP and give them an understanding of what guests of the Gala truly brought it.
That hooded godmother next to Zendaya is creepy.
I was waiting for Darren, but nope that didn't show him!
i feel like i am in fucking district 1 in the hunger games, what the fuck is this shit, it's all so unnecessary and they try to say its fashion, the biggest move would have been to roll up in some jeans and a t-shirt, would have got the most attention too.

Lady Gaga knows the real definition of camp. She really fits the theme tbh.

i’m sorry, but if anyone fit the theme, it was lady gaga. a hugely important part of camp is the performance. she did a 16 minute performance on the red carpet with moments of cheesiness and exaggeration. the outfits had contrasting colors, and the orginal dress and makeup were also over the top. gaga embodied camp in many moments of her career. 

my s rank is zendaya, lady gaga, and billy porter. they didn’t show zendaya’s second outfit and how much she focused on the actual detail. billy porter’s presence alone embodied camp.
Man, Jeannie looks so fine in this video. She going to an award show? 😂

I don't think that one lady knows what camp is. "They're pretty but they're not matching the theme". Dude, they were putting on a performance. Camp is about the theatrics. If you want to see a example of pretty but not following the theme look up Gisele Bundchen.
GET NEW REACTORS, THE OTHER GIRLS WERE USELESS REACTORS!!!

Lady Gaga is not camp?! What?! These people NEED to read THE NOTE'S ON CAMP. (It's not just the dress people) Gawhd can you spare your five minutes and do research?
Lol the reactors have NO TASTE
Do they understand the theme? It isn’t about being extravagant it’s about being yourself through art. Finding the art within ones self and express it. Because you are either the art or you are wearing the art. If it happens to be extravagant then great but it’s all about finding your inner spirit and exploring it. Gaga is one of the few who truly understood the camp them and it’s meaning.
What the Hell is this world coming to?

Salt... So much salt, for something as lousy as fashion would be if it was just about definitions. If you see it as art, opinion is the most important thing, the EMOTION it gives you is the most important. And if it doesn't fit the ''over the top'' of someone, you are nobody to criticize him/her/whatever (lul)

It amuses me when people think they know what they're talking about. "She doesn't fit the theme" "She's just peeling off dresses" HAHAHAHAHA the "camp experts" have spoken.

ok i love you FBE, but sorry not sorry THIS EPISODE SUCK. I repeat THIS SUCK
Everyone on this video is so clueless about fashion and art. It's almost unbearable to watch
Umm where's Lucy Boynton??
gaga didnt fit the theme? you must have a different definition of what camp is cause jesus fucking christ her fucking performance was 16 mins long and had four outfits hello??
Pls do a video of "Adults react to female/male snapchat filter"
Wow. Y’all suck at this.
Clearly these people don’t know what’s campy! Zendaya outfit totally fit the theme you dumpster fuck.
You forgot lily!
Where Lilly!?!
Frank Ocean had the best outfit
Interviewer: This is a trend made popular by idubz when he ranked fast food 


Brandon: This is from competitive fighting games.


Interviewer: IDUBBZ! FAST FOOD!
This was stupid you can’t judge if you don’t know what camp is.
Its not fair to grade Gaga on just pics. You have to watch her entire performance to truly understand how camp it was
They literally don’t know the definition of camp
Zendiea???
"my definition of camp" NO its either the definition or not period
Harry Styles was the best don’t @ me
Is it just me or were they hard on Mr. Leto...they freaked over Harry’s outfit when it was a simple mesh and frill pantsuit...he carried his own head and they wanted more?!?!
Yara Shahidi and Zendaya had the best outfit imo
The fact that some put Harry‘s horrible and basic non camp outfit at S but gaga‘s outfit(the best met gala entrance of all time named by Vogue) at fucking A-C tf?!
all I’m saying is everything is irrelevant until 11:38 💁‍♂️
Nah they really don't know what is the real meaning of camp

If I remember, Camp started with parties back in the 1900s with the queen would order men to wear women's clothing and women to wear mens clothing.. Its basically over the top cross dressing.. Hence, it was the queens parties and everyone invited were nobles and wore flashy clothing! Most of the women didn't get the theme
those who didn't put lady gaga in the super section have no taste
Yo what happened to Milly videos you guys suck for that
Girl Lady Gaga is literally the definition of Camp!!! WTF are you talking about!! Hands down Gaga was the best! And of course Harry as well!

Lol even though I did disagree with some of their statements, I still think people shouldn’t lecture their statements when the whole point in not only in this video but this WHOLE channel, is to state your opinion. If you disagree, then go watch some politics for a change. Because there is actually a point in disagreeing. Everyone featured in this channel is entitled into their opinion and if you don’t think they’re correct about it, just STOP WATCHING! Nobody wants to hear your lecture about someone’s entitled opinion.
Before I am gonna watch This U BETTER NOT DISRESPECT MY BOY HARRY DAMN STYLES
Gaga' s was a full performance too
The problem with this one, is that they're only seeing the pictures. There was a performance component as well, so the reactors coudn't accurately rate how truly extra the outfits were. They were only seeing half of the show the attendees were putting on. So if you only see what Lady Gaga or Zendaya were wearing, of course you were gonna think they didn't fit the theme, when in fact, they did. To a frickin' T. Zendaya even lost her shoe! But no one saw that, because all they saw was a still image. I would've showed them video footage instead.

Do some of them even know what camp is?
So these people are judging Gaga’s camp outfits and don’t no what camp actually is or means. 🙄🙄🙄

“I have to laugh.” -Lady Gaga
First of all, Lady Gaga WAS the embodiment of camp on that red carpet. It was a performance! It's more than just peeling off outfits. And why is Harry Styles even on here... And where is Jenelle Monet? Where is Celine Dion? Also, remember, this is for fashion, even though Katy Perry's outfit was really extra, it was borderline costumey, instead of fashion.

For anyone who wants to know more about what camp really is you should watch this: 
Where's Shawn, guys?
They obviously dont know what camp is 🙃🙃
Harry is my future husband. He just doesn't know that yet because we havebt met... Yet!
However, I absolutely hated his outfit the most. I didn't like it at all!
Zendeya's was the best
harry’s outfit was so damn bland
Ironic thinking Lady Gaga didn't fit the theme of "camp".

Honestly my favorite looks had to be Lady Gaga, Billy Porter and Ezra Miller.  All three of them are super tier in my book.
we needed a FULL review..
Jared Leto is not THE joker!
Liked his outfit.
Why do people still mispronounce Zendaya's name?
These were all above A tier.... the ones who were bad did not even have a chance to be ranked -- let alone any of the people who were off theme/boring.

Are you kidding me, LADY GAGA IS THE DEFINITION OF CAMP!
I'm so glad that George was in this episode to give Harry his deserved F. Someone like him who is familiar with androgony would see that his look was basic as hell and that there was nothing campy about it.

Also who is that lady saying Gaga didn't fit the theme? She was one of the campiest of the night in looks and performance...
don't come at me but is it only me who hated card's dress?
Anybody else not give a shit about celebrity fashion?
RNA my darling educate yourself.....: camps is not only about the fashion is also about the whole presentation of it.  Lady Gaga served you Camp to the sky she gave you a 15 min show and interpretation of Camp.
Cardi B tried to be iconic with the giant train the ruby nipped and the bold color, but it ended up being a bit of a mess...
why does george looks like a mix of brie larson and sophie turner here
Metropolin?
React to the Final Fantasy VII  Remake re-reveal trailer 😊

Katy perry had the best y'all just hating on her cause she's creative but I'm happy almost all of u put her in A and S as were she belongs and for who didn't I feel sorry for u living that way
college reacts to fancy
How would it look when katy perry  take a seat
Hi
Katy Perry had the best
Get Jaxon on here to react to him singing the lazy song when he was little at the talent show! You could do like a reactors react to them before they were reactors!
F to all. That's my rank.
FBE, have the Teens react to the Try to Keep Dancing Challenge, please. I have some suggestions they should dance to.
1. Queen - Don't Stop Me Now
2. DNCE - Cake by the Ocean
3. Iggy Azalea - Mo Bounce
4. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 music - Chemical Plant Zone
5. XAVI3R3 & DVNK SINATRV - Pop
Idc what you say Harry’s rocked the met gala 😍
Camp = extra
I don't understand these synonyms
Yo
cardi b dress look like a bloody tampon
Y'all missed Dua Lipa and Janelle in this list tho but okay
If you get what Camp is, Katy Perry can't be below an A. She nailed Camp on the head.
"my definiton of camp'

yall definition is literally camping outdoors
zen-dAy-a how many times does she have to explain herself smh
Gaga looked gorgeous💗
RNA list is shitty and should be burned
Wow some of the reactors were also really dressed up 😍 Wondering if that was to fit the theme or unrelated 😄
Especially Jeannie looks so good 😍
It urks me a bit on how they say Zen-DIE-ah . I always thought it was Zen-DAY-ah.
Why y’all call zendaya,Zen-die-a????
Katy perry had the best
Teens react to supermariologan
They all get S and A’s in my opinion :)
jeannie looked so gorgeous and glamorous, loved her look so much
None of these can beat the hoodie, lets get real here
Cardi didn‘t looked good ... her dress was awful...
He really said zendAYA
Stream one directions new song
LOL at the person who said that they wanted a "little, little more originality" but still put Harry Styles in a sheer top above Jared Leto with an entire replica of his head and full regalia. Harry looked nice, but come on.
Camp is Gaga, Gaga is Camp
Ezra Fucking Miller! Yes!
am I the only one who reminds Jared leto's extra head of gibby from icarly?
How did gaga not fit the theme? she put on a overly dramatized performance with each outfit whereas camp literally means "exaggerated or theatrical in style"...
9:27 oh yeah yeah
The Hunger Games in real life
KATY PERRY THE QUEEN OF THE MET GALA
Harry styles 😍❤
REACT TO STRAY KIDS PLEASE!
DZHUIFBJEZJFEJN WAIT THAT GIRL REALLY SAID LADY GAGA DOESN'T FIT THE CAMP THEME????? SHE INVENTED CAMP SHE'S BEEN SERVING CAMP LOOKS SINCE 2008.. THE AUDACITY
Elders react 365 Katy Perry & Zedd
People saying that they didn’t feat the theme LIKE DUDE ALL OF THEM WERE THE CAMPIEST OF THEM ALL LIKE THE FUCJ
Were was jlo
Please ROSALIAAAA!!!
3:13 Brandon:this dress follows camp very well. It's over the top, it's crazy, she looks like a chandelier...Like she could hang over a dinner table maybe.


Things just got dark! 😭😂
we need more of that short white haired  person.
It was over for me the moment she said Gaga doesn't fit the theme lmao like girl sit down please
People who don’t know what embodies camp rating these looks? Nah man they missed the mark so hard lmao
If  #JeffreeStar DOES NOT end up at the  #MetGala next year ... I swear to God  ...I'm gonna RIOT! He could have totally ripped this place to shreds with one step on that rug!
harry styles lost his fucking mind !!!!!!
“Oh i hate that” damn...
The fact that people STILL call her "ZendEYEa" is crazy 😂💀
Where was Frank Ocean TF
What the hell is camp couture? I still don't get it.
okay but zin - die - yah?
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
lmao people giving harry styles A and Bs when he literally just wore a see through shirt. this is bare minimum culture >:( and they gave lupita Ds??? the meninists they are... could never be me
It's funny how they rate Harry Styles so high for doing a frilly bow top [groundbreaking!] but then rate Ezra Miller and Jared Leto lower, who both took bigger risks
No shawn mendes no thanks!!!
welcome to the Hunger Games!!!!
React to: tour the world music video please!!
these people praised harry because he was wearing a see-through shirt but dissed gaga bc she looked "pretty" and just "peeled off her clothes"??? make it make sense... Camp is all about being over the top and somewhat stereotypically idiotic and humorous. All of gaga's poses on the red carpet were sort of to mock the way she was dressed and styled. And the fact that her entrance was 15 minutes to mimic the "15 minutes of fame" saying is genius. these ppl r just dumb lol
You should react to AJR and their new album called Neotheater. They're awesome!
YOU DIS NOT JUST SAY HARRY STYLES OUTFIT LOOKED LIKE A HAND MAIDENS
Half of them don't even understand what "camp" is but they are so confident in saying it doesn't fit the theme. Okay, Mary.
Purrrrrfect hahahahaha
This is actually my first time even knowing what Met Gala even is, but those outfits are out of this world lol! 😂😁👍
Tell them react and eat 1800 food
The look on Dominic's face when y'all described what the MET Gala is and the theme this year...GAVE.ME.LIFE
George is whole mood
Harry styles!!!!❤️
Idk but I think RNA has no idea what she's talking about
Zendaya, Harry Styles, Jared Leto, and Lady Gaga were my least favorites this year.
Omg male wearing female clothing! So courageous.. so innovative! Give me a fucking brake
Farrah Moan is that you?
The adults say that this doesn’t fit the theme and then said lady Gaga wasn’t camp Σ('◉⌓◉’)
Next time ask people with TASTE to rate the met gala looks. Harry so high and Jared Leto so low?!?!?! I have to laugh
What up fam
Tf
Hunger games will happen in 2025
I get it its a theme and all but they look fcking ridiculous im sorry😂
They needed to watch the Gaga clip instead of the pic.
Please don’t hate on Harry. Pls Thankyou 😂

RNA is so wrong on everything...... Please.....
Half of these people weren’t even judging based on the theme
Where’s nicki
At the end of the day, hoodies still win
if Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes wore what they were wearing at the Grammy's then that would have been cute because they legit looked like they were BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
Hi
React to Miley and Liam ( including their marriage)
I get personal preference and opinion but y'all are WRONG!!!!!. First of all, over the top isn't enough. it has to be a LOOKand performance counts too.
Zendaya gave us a STORY!, A PERFORMANCE. With Euphoria coming out she is shedding her Disney skin, that was an homage to Disney princesses and Disney. SHE LEFT A DAMN GLASS SLIPPER.
Lady Gaga gave us 4 oufits ON THE DAMN CARPET, she gave us a PERFORMANCE!!!!
Ezra Miller gave us a LEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWK!!!!
Don't even get me started on Lupita, she was the most camp (after Billy Porter). CAMP was started by Drag Queens and she gave us A DRAG LEWK!!!!!
Billy Porter!!!!! Periodt.


Harry Styles wore a blouse and y'all just praised him. HE WAS A CO-CHAIR, and all he could think of was BLOUSE??? Try again.
Katy Perry was over the top but then what??? Where is the FASHION part of her look??? WHERE??? And then she changed into a BURGER!!!! I can't.


sigh. Let me go to sleep.
Why is that girls Name Ribonucleinacid looool
I love you guys where do you get your inspiration from?
GEEEOOOORRRRGGEEEE<3
Billy Porter SNAPPED! Great embodiment of what Camp is!!! So excited for Pose season 2
The girls at 6:20 is almost wearing the same thing, but in white and doesn't show as much skin. I do not see why they are being so harsh on Harry just because he is wearing something like that. I get it, it might not be the best, but at least he wantes to stand out and be different.
Check out "a whole new world" by zayn and zhavia or "I don't care" by justin bieber and ed sheeran

I'm simple. I saw Harry Freaking Styles and I clicked
i love how everyone became an expert on camp in 5 minutes the last week 🙄
George..Calm down, Beyoncé...
Oof
Wow
HEEY😄 I'm loving Zendaya's Dress
People be putting Jared Leto under Harry Styles.

Do any of you understand camp or nah?? Camp is being EXTRA. Harry Styles was boring.
I think they should have added the fact that Zendaya literally left a glass slipper on the stairs
Kids react to Dragon Ball franchise
My favorite thing about seeing people’s takes on the Met Gala this year is watching people who have no idea what camp is talking about these looks.
Ngl Rna's opinions really angered me
REACT TO TATI'S BYE SISTER VIDEO
Kids react to Dragon Ball franchise
They were putting it based on of they liked it or not and o disagree with that. It should have been judged on how well it fits the themes. Lupita and Katy’s were easy S because they were really good camp over the top
idk I feel like y'all explained camp pretty poorly to people that didn't what it was
Please react to the Dolan twins
1:13 excuse me did you say
Zendiea
so george was the only one who even remotely understood the theme,,,,,,
can we talk about the name of the woman being rna, the ribunocleic acid?
Am I showing my age too much when I say I don't understand the new slang definitions for words like tea, camp, daddy, etc. It just doesn't make sense to me.
Lady Gaga PAWS UP #1
College kids react to Jamiroquai
Zendaya could step on me and I’d say thank you
It would be cool if they reacted to oliver tree
shout out my name^_^
"Lady Gaga doesnt fit the theme" 
me: haha good one
react to new hope club please
Lady Gaga didn't fit the theme?????!!! Girl are u ok? Gaga has been the embodiment of camp her whole career and the 16 minutes performance she served on the carpet was yet another proof of that.
A girl in my class said that Cardi's  dress looked like a tempurpedic and that she could sleep on the train
Sorry but I like my people to look like the gender they identify as. I'd like to know what to address them as without having to guess.
YAAAASSSS GAGA!! 😍❤🙌👐
HARRY STYLES HIMSELF IS THE DEFINISION OF "CAMP"
Why does George look like Brie Larson?
Imagine the scenes if sme1 walked there with iron man outfit.
I dont think they know what Camp truly means.
I didn't like Harry's because it's been done so much and so much better. It wasn't anything special to me.
Janelle monae was the epitome of camp where is her look?!?!
They really don’t get ‘CAMP’
None of them understood the theme, and none of them understand fashion.
That gender confused guy judges outfits based on money.
JEANNIE LOOKS SO PRETTY ❤
I'm not trying to start anything but watching a lot of these met gala outfit videos I see many people are saying that Harry styles outfit was "empowering" and breaking toxic masculinity just breaks my heart because BTS one of my fav group (JUNGKOOK) he wore the exact same outfit and people were saying they look like girls. It just hypocritical and this is no way aiming it at the FBE reactors I just wanted to point it out
Harry Styles outfit was the worst for me. Lady Gaga definitely impressed me by bringing back the old Gaga I know and love. Cardi's was one of my favorites because it definitely defined camp all the way through.
React to Sunmi, IU, Jessi, Dreamcatcher, (G)I-dle

Great video! But i have a suggestion for a "try not to...." challenge, how about a "Try not to flinch or get scared challenge", thank you
WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN ITS HOW TO SAY ZENDAYA??? ZEN-DIE-A??? WUT
girlie at 12:30 has no taste she literally said gaga didn't fit the theme, girlie gaga is a camp queen since she was born and she also said she didn't like Harry's look like girlie really ???? are you okay
Harry Styles didn’t do anything Camp... he just took Prince(RIP) style
At least say her name right
Darren criss had the best look !
They should have seen videos of the outfits, not just pictures. In my opinion Camp is so much more than just fashion, it's the way you carry the outfit.
UMM ZEN-DIE-A .....3:12
RNA sweetie do u know what Camp is?
yess thank you!!!! I requested this!!! Love you FBE❤

what's the point of the MET Gala? why is everyone so excited about it?
Hi FBE
Yo where is Janelle Monoe ???
please do a college kids/adults react to mulan live action
that woman saying lady gaga doesnt "fit the theme at all" is probably the dumbest thing ive ever heard maam gaga IS camp and she been camp her whole career. mayhaps fbe should have shown a video of her outfit changes to understand the concept...
Ok but Zendaya's dress GLOWED, thats a solid A rank at least
Harry Styles is my Daddyyy
I hated Harry Styles outfit
No one:
The man: ZANDAAYA
Thankfully George was there to explain to the viewers what CAMP means, although I wish George elaborated more. FBE didn't do a good job explaining nor have many of the people making review videos on Youtube (besides fashion channels). People put out these videos for views since the Met Gala is trendy without bothering to fully comprehend the theme and WHY they chose it.

i get sad when people shit on harrys outfit (i mean you don’t have to like it but this is just how i feel because i am a fan obviously lmao). i know people expected him to do more and have an outfit over the top but this outfit was over the top for him. the heels, the earing, the lace it was all new for him. it might not have been that extravagant but he was comfortable, he was happy, and next met he will probably do a more outgoing look:)
and btw this isn’t for them in the video this is just for everyone in general who was confused on why he didn’t do more!

Paulette looks like Michael jackson
This will appeal to 18 / 60, Male / Female.
Fun fact: that dude at the end saying 'I'm a ghost too, and I expect nothing less', is also the same guy from the previous game (Wildlands) who plays with you and wrecks a base all by himself. So yeah, when people who played the first one saw that they will be against him, first thing that came in mind was 'Oh we are so fuuckkeeddd'
The division had the best cover mehanic for me
Hats off to the mom who knew splinter cell
Stop being trans
The military man liked it so much he says he wants to play with himself lol 6:38
Great video! Stay safe and God bless!
So many dumb fucks that still don't understand trailers and cinematic will NEVER be like the real graphics
Wish the Punisher was the main character, not the villain
I cant tell if paulette is male or female
A GHOST DUDE?
I would go see that movie


Me- confused tom face
Can you guys do Rainbow Seige
"I see why maybe BOYS would like this." Sexist as fuck. But GO WAMEN
PAULETTE
I play ghost recon wildlands and there’s definitely people ranging from 15-60yrs old playing on PvP lol. Girls and guys. I love this franchise!
Y r the only cool elders the other girls and their own dad
“That looks so real” 
Of course it’s not game engine it’s just cinematic...
Um... Those people reacting. I doubt most of them even play games. Also that lady reactor with the mohawk haircut looks like a bloke.
I believe they have a Green beret help make this game.
Been watching the trailer on repeat everyday since it came out, I remember hearing early about the game going to be announced and I got so excited, I kind of expected it since when they added the new mission into Wildlands they mentioned a bunch of new teams, etc. In the dialogue which I knew was them hinting the next game.
Frank castle vs Dude perfect dude...
7:52 
Sounds like Marcus Jensen and looks
"Boys would like this?" How about gamers would like this :)
FYI, some of us elders will be playing the new Ghost Recon because it looks excellent. Just hope they use some of the better realism elements from Siege in the game. Though with the fence cutting we did see one of those elements in the game.
its not really war though. Its a game.
First seconds of the video....
“IT LOOKS SO REAL”

It will look nothing like that lol
Remember it's Ubisoft  just be ready for a disappointment 😂😂
im so hyped
0:32 we wish
Woman fighting in elite regiments....doesn’t happen...smh
Also react to Rainbow 6 Siege, best game out there
This series butchered Bolivia, I’m happy they’re going to a fictional place now
"Is this the game?" That was me before learning the gaming industry. Ahh the lies that were being told to me over and over.
More PAULETTE
Anyone in the comments going to explain to me whether that old person is a man or female. I'm baffled
Lmao the old lady didnt know or was told it was a game through almost the whole video
Ok it looks good and all but keep in  mind that this is Ubisoft, they are going to tune down graphics on release.
Is that Dona from Brandon Rogers?
I love how the lady knows more about games then every one together
Wasn't expecting Frank Castle to be in this game, but now I'm not surprised. This man is a merciless tank!
Dont expect fancy gears if you join military after ghost recon lmao
Man I miss Tom clancy ㅠ
Woah so the guy in the video was also on an island fighting drones? He’s the real Nomad am I right guys?




Guys?
So apparently making movies about war is okay, but *VIDEO GAMES*!
Old people know thier clancy nice.
Socialist justice snowflake NPCs are complaining about ths game for some reason 😂 but do they even need a reason these days 😂
Man, there's something about that Hispanic guy that makes me think he was in the military.
me 12 and the best game ever
Sharon wondering if it was Splinter Cell; is the greatest thing ever.
respect to the grandma who knows splinter cell
The fact that you have to have an internet connection and that there are no a.i teammates made me decide not to buy this one. And with me others. I hope unisoft listens to the criticism and change it so it is possible to have ai teammates and offline playability
The first ghost recon i played was from the Nokia N-Gage
2:38 LMAOOOO "I would go see that movie'
1:04 is that Michael Jackson?!?!
Jesus dude. After the first time mentioning you we're in the military it has no point mentioning it every single fucking time.....
I just hope the story and difficulty isn't washed down.. i really want to feel hunted and outgunned. i just hope it's as brutal as it makes it out to be and not washed down.
1:17 she’s gorgeous
Let's not Forget Breakpoint is in the same UNiverse as Rainbow Six Siege
Buying this day 1
Just looks like some origin story for nomad from bo3
Lmao I’m 12 and I grow up on “violent” games
Wow I've never seen Ethan excited about anything
How the fuck has none of these people even one of these games!?!?!
Lol
0:33 "Is this like a splinter cell?" infinite respect
"Kids won't understand this"




Said by the 19 year old
Those aren't graphics. It's CGI animation. The trailer was made by Unit Image in Paris.
Wait Sharon know about Splinter Cell? Respect 1000
the grandma knows.
A GHOST DUDE
Is it me or... 
Paulette looked like momo..?
Brings me back to the very first Ghost Recon game..
Cinematic trailers ≠ game graphics.
Play Arma then say these games are realistic
If you want realism play arma 3 and ace mod
lol deep down we all know ubisoft graphics at trailer time and in real game .
Is that aman or woman in the orange🤣🤣🤣
Not boys, Men would like this.
1:06 MOTHAFUCKA
Teens play rainbow six siege please!
Yo what’s Donna from Brandon Rogers doin here 1:05
1:56 like everyone who watched the premiere.
So...Paulette’s a real person? Not a guy in a mask?
Ethan knows his games
I don’t even think the elders know how to use a controller or even a keyboard
I love Kim!
Should have done the drone trailer......
Make em play Insurgency Sandstorm
6:33 “I wouldn’t let my two little granddaughters watch it”

10 seconds later

 “I might even get my daughter into this”
Splinter cell 5
“I was a infantry, except I didn’t kick in doors, I just got hazed endlessly”
Damn! Homeboy looks like the Crypt Keeper.
That’s the girl from Brandon Rodgers video the old lady 😂😂😂😂
I cant waaiiitt I've already pre ordered
2:10 gHoST DuDe
Should have stuck with the gamers reacting not just some elders who can't even hear what is being said
Watching the trailer gave me literal shivers up my spine, I haven't had that in a long time....
How you going to talk about war when all you know is from your dad being in the Air Force haha ...really
"This seems like a game boys would like"
Paulette  sexiest
LOL. I'm a ghost dude.
"I'm a Ghost, too"
- Jon Bernthal, 2019
Predator teaser trailer please
One person was like I wouldn't let my granddaughter play but the it the infantry guys like " I'm gonna get my daughter into this" I love it 🤣
Do generations react to Aminé
I'm a Ghost Dude.
Boys? No=Today’s Gamers Yes🎮  5:02
Am I the only one that's lowkey terrified of Paulette?
"The graphics keep getting better and better" he says about a CGI trailer.....SMH.
Some of these people are so dumb it hurts.....
2:03 yo is THAT A FUCKING DUDE?!?!
Hell yeah, Infantry leads the way!
Why is CGI in games better than in movies these days? I mean come on, Avatar's CGI was amazing and that was a movie, 10 YEARS AGO!
woah they got Micheal Jackson back to react! Thats sick
Im a Ghost Dude.
Can you guys check out the new Predator trailer
6:44 best dad... ever! XD
First time I thought this is a movie..
Elders react to Lil Uzi Vert
Please😁😁😁😁😁 a always watch videos
COLLEGE KIDS REACT OR PLAY COMMAND AND CONQUER : ZERO HOUR
Elder react to Shirley Curry a.k.a Skyrim Grandma
started with advanced warfighter 2, future soldier was my shit, and recently playing wildlands it was great. def getting this at some point
THEY HAVE HER XD2:03 OMG LELELELEL
When your trailer looks like a movie, you know your game is going to do well
The punisher? Haven't heard that name in years
Does it have rtx? I wanna use my rtx 2080 ti in a good game battlefield is boring
This game is so hype!!
Generations React to Escape from Tarkov
Generations React to Escape from Tarkov.
Stan knows his Tom Clancy’s stuff
They should react to borderlands 3.
It's just a trailer.
5:20 I agree with Sharon.
OH SHIT that’s Paulette from Brandon Rogers!
So, whose gonna tell them?
Look like he character switching 😑
My computer is crying rn I've got a fricking gt 1030 lol
Too bad they don’t know that friendly AI won’t be in the game.
ITs not available on Steam :(
Most elders in these video game reaction videos just don't seem to fit into these videos
I wish it was a splinter cell
Getting strong army of two vibes
Yeah well we’ve also had games about Hell and killing innocent people sooo
6:21 did just witness Alibi/maestro get knifed hahahaha
Only one of these people actually knows what combats like I don’t know why you asked the others cause they both never saw combat so wtf
GIMME A SHOUTOUT BABY
Paulette is Donna from stuff and sam
It requires persistent internet connection even for solo...Pass for me... Just hate this trend...
They Talk about The Game Realism in Combat.  For me i give this Game 60% only.for the tactical and Combat Shootout. Because I Watch some War News on TV and YouTube in Iraq war, afghanistan..in every War Conflicts Specially in Middle East. The War Zone Environment their is Totally Different in Video Games.  The Guy on Interview Saying his a Soldier.. I think that guy never Experience in Combat. What if next Interview is a Soldiers who Experience in Combats. I believe they will Said this👉 "Exaggerated Shooting". I like the Game like a "Hollywood" movie. But if you say This game is Totally Real in Shooting Combat.  You really a Big "Stupid" Person.
ubisoft makes good games trailer but downgrades, bug, lootboxing and incomplete games will always be your brand.
Is this a DLC for wild lands or a new game?
bruh i swear thats michael jackson 4:02
iT lOoKs So ReAl
Of course they were paid, and i'm sure this game ain't  w o n ' t  flop. React to a real tactical shooter you speds. Ready or Not, specifically.
I a fan of tom clancy serise i a 14 years old and i like rainbow six sige, divsion , ghost recon wildland for me and this new game
Their stupidity gets me everytime. At the very least the folks that are in the age of 18-20 should know that the trailer is cgi and not the actual game...
Legends say, one of the people reacting was in the army...
You should let them try Warframe.
Mk11 fatalities
MK11 fatalities, please
It's CG not in game
i subbed you please sub back
Who else is going to watch this movie when it comes out :D
Next have them react to the original GR.  Minds will explode....
Plz shout-out for me.... Thx
6:45 "I'm gonna play with myself, I might even get my daughter's involved" lol I can't be the only one who caught that
I would’ve bought the game anyways but John bernthal was the tipping point. Are you kidding me that’s so badass!!
Please react to world of dance the kings all performance
The old lady from Brandon Rogers 👍
Glad Ubisoft is doing promotions. Wildlands was so underappreciated
Does no body know who that man was at the end and if not I'm disappointed and if u do I'ma be proud lol
This makes wildlands look like doodoo water
Am I going to get it? Yea, am I going to enjoy it? Yea, am I going to sell it when I get bored once I pass it in the few months as it collects dust like my other recon games?  Yea.
a turmoil??? military ppl play war video games too smh
NO ITS NOT A GAME! Just a cinematic trailer, the real game will look like shit.
WHY DO THE REACTERS THINK THIS IS THE FIRST EVER WAR GAME!?!
6:43 "I want to play with myself"
Mikaela: It is targeted to teens.
PEGI: This game is for 18+.
Aaahwhat? Girl u ok?
Have more military guys react to this
There was a free to play Ghost Recon game on steam. I can't recall what it was called, but it was only PvP. They did a good job on gameplay variety.
React to 
Ace combat 7 Vr missions
the dude is the orange shirt  is that man ?
😴😴😴
Reactors seem to enjoy good graphics, they should definitely to Old Soldier cinematic from World of Warcraft. it has amazing CGI it looks like a movie scene
1:33 It gives me flashbacks too




Of WILDLANDS
Can this channel just die already?
I saw the premiere of this a couple days ago, I am SO excited for it, love the concept of this one and definitely preordering the Ultimate Edition of it
I cannot wait for this . This game is going to be amazing !! The people who complain know nothing about video games
5:02 Hey, I like it too :o
Ghost recon : we make realistic tactical games..

ARMA : hold my beer
It’s not game play you ducks it’s in real engine footage
Right when they realease these games I play minecraft with mods.... I'm even 17
I like how they are reacting like this is something new, never before seen. I get why the elders or adults wouldn't know know about it but the teens never heard or seen Wildlands? Only 1 person knows about it? Too much Fortnite I guess.
Why the fuck is Mikaela in this video?
Jon Bernthal's voice is perfect for this role. Goddammit, this definitely has a Punisher vibe to it, I'm lovin' it.
So
How much?
Mad respect for Sharon here. Never knew she was one of us. I wonder how many of the FBE cast currently play the Division 2 and what they think about it.
2:41 WTF
Generations react to Haihai (The 2 year old baby who uses chopsticks)
Frank Castle before his redemption
2:07 I did'nt know Michael Jackson was still alive
I completed wildlands at the age of 12
I can 100% say that the game won't look like this when it comes out... Marketing strategy, make the demo look unbelievable, when the game comes out make it feel 10x worst
Just don't pre-order it , trust me
they should have seen wildlands trailer and gameplay before this before getting all the hype
We all know it ain’t gonna look like that when it releases, we all remember the siege trailer
My boyyyy Punisher in this game !!!!
it looks so real  just wait until they release it lmao ubisoft
Yes I wanna play that new game it looks good, more realistic than wild lands currently is, I love shooting war games like this and I want gears 5 as well when it finally released
Surprisingly no one's reacting to how hot the teen girl is, comment sections are Normlly full of that.
why are you reacting this when you missed every important game in 2019? money?
React To Insurgency Sandstorm
6:33 ahhh a zombie
As someone who played the Ghost Recon online shooter on steam, are the Phantoms returning?
They should make movie instead of game. They will make more money on this.
Scott looks like keemstar🤔
Most thought it was a movie haha
So do you have a girlfriend .... me 6:44
John Bernthal!
So now we're supposed to watch people react to a paid for commercial content...
So strange none of them knew shit about the Ghost Raccoon series.
Its the old lady from BRANDON ROGERS!!
ah, so shane became a ghost then.... makes sense 😂
Imagine this was owned by EA.
what the hell is that michael jackson who is reacting
It’s my boy PUNISHER
4:18 Gravity Falls
By Paulette do they actually mean Paul? I bet they do.
My biggest let down of Wildlands was not only the tedious meaningless task but the shallow stealth. After MGSV military stealth gameplay bar was set so fuckin high I hope this truly delivers and the AI isn't idiotic.
Never played a Tom Clancy game before but this game looks amazing. I would deff try it
Ethan @ 10:53 explained ghost recons gameplay so well.
I grew up with Ghost recon and the series definitely revolutionize the  tactical shooter genre. I really wish I was apart of this reaction video because I have so much knowledge about this game! It's because of Ghost recon Wildlands of course lol(the first open world game in the ghost recon series)  and it made Breakpoint for what it is now. Wildlands had about 30 developers and they did a great job with wildlands and now they have at least over a 1,000 developers for Breakpoint and so far what we seen they are doing an excellent job so far! Wildlands set this game up by giving us clues in the special operations (DLC updates) about skell tech and the last update wildlands dropped they gave us a huge hint/clue on operation Oracle when they introduced Cole Walker (aka the punisher to everyone). If you have played it and you know how hyped the community is (like myself) for this game.
I'm a 34 year old female and I wanna play this so damb bad
“I’m a ghost too”

“He’s a ghost dude?!?”
Yeah now show them Arma 3, Squad, Escape From Tarkov & Insurgency Sandstorm if you want that full immersion. I mean i love Ghost Recon series but you want a total mil sim go with the list i mentioned. Can't wait for this game tho haha...
I feel like alot of these young adults have never seen ghost recon wildlands like that " oh their mobile now" comment 😐😑🙄😝
Idk y this video was made. Ubisoft is over hyping the game n it works.. Was waiting for days for now.

Edit: is this the right audiences or platform? Why a reaction video?
React To Medievil 2019
6:43 i definately wanna play with myself.  I died a little.
Oh poor Paulette some say till this day she still believes it’s a movie
This is awesome
Keemstar is that you?
Lady, you'd be suprised how many girls and older adults like this games. This series is 🔥
1:33 I’m getting flashbacks 
PTSD has entered chat 
*pulls out AR15
Graphic in Trailer vs In Game
That’s misandrist. “Guys just like seeing stuff blow up”
The audio of every little thing was very good, ima cop this game.!
Oh shit she knew what splinter cell is fuck yea dude
Everybody: Aw that’s punisher 

Me: Aw shit that’s Shane from the walking dead
I don’t trust Ubisoft
I am praying they release checkerboard 4k rendering for ps4 pro... Please Ubisoft please do that!
I love military games! Enough said!
Why does everyone always assume movie lol
We've made video games about war for like 30 years where have you been? Also did no one tell skeletor that this is a game?
John Berthal voice...yep... I'm in
This has to be staged asf 😂
What happens with this channel... They looks like idiots, who is the moron who writes the lines. At least bring professional actors
wait is that a trans old lady?? Never seen that before
Elders react to Pavlov
"Looks like a heavy emphasis on stealth"

Ya think? That's how spec ops soldiers usually operate
Yeah that’s the granny from Brandon Rogers channel. Respect ✊
"Oh I think this is a new movie... Coming out" 😂
The guy at 3:30 is getting confused with the division
Ghost recon wildlands was so shite
Good marketing FBE. I’m actually interested, thanks!
the gameplay trailers are always better than the actual game, like so many people were disappointed with Watch Dogs and Anthem, tho you could change the graphics files in watch dogs
Would be fun to see a "React" to Days Gone =D (playing against any horde) =)
Paulette 🤢
0:34 i wanna personally meet this lovely woman and have a nice beer with her ❤️
If they go back to the old style, instead of going Wildlands... I'm going to be dissapointed.
How can you do this but not red dead redemption 2
Im surprised so many of them new it was Tom Clancy or at least Ghost Recon. I played all the old ones as well as Wildlands. In my opinion they were all 10/10
That veteran was fucking awesome ! Respect to him from the UK 🇺🇸🇬🇧
They want realism, make them play arma3.👌
Ubisoft will somehow mess it up
Get Adults or Generations to react to Jedi Fallen Order, I want to see Scott’s reaction to it
If it came out on the platform i play on, then i would definitely buy it.
We are in 2019 and people still can't understand the difference between CGI trailer and Gameplay
This game looks great, BUT Ubisoft doesn't always deliver on the hype.
React to IT now
That old lady has a very deep voice
IT chapter 2 pliz
I love Mikaela
Kind a scary stuff creepy guys 🤣🤣
If you wanna see Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint, as a movie, one way to do that, is to type a game's name to youtube search and after that type word: Game Movie. That way, you can watch game, as a movie (but it is not so long as game, and editor's cut that game, to that way, that it is like a movie), if you don't wanna or are not able to play it. Give it a try, and see what you like about these Game Movies.
IT CHAPTHER 2

“Oh, he’s in the prone”
It won't look anywhere near as good as the trailer's and will probably just play like the division 2
War sells.
These people think this is graphic, see mortal combat 11
Now with RTX 1080p 30FPS incoming!
Nobody:
Military guy: "that's me"
"I definitely wanna play with myself"
Damn I guess Ubi really reached out to everyone

To the lady who said that she feels torn because of her fathers military background. It seems like youre unsure if games should glorify war, but movies and television have been doing that for decades. There is a primal desire we have as humans to want to be a warrior. Its normal to think of these games with brutal killing as cool, because while its gruesome it fullfills that warrior fantasy inside us without actually having to put ourselves in real combat.

These games also provide their entertainment through skill and tactical thinking. This challenge is what stimulates our minds and gives us that gratification when we defeat the enemies. Its not that we glorify killing when we play the game, because we know its all fantasy, and no one is actually getting hurt from it. Its the story, the action, and the challenge being overcome that provides the entertainment. The violence within the game is just the foundation for that experience.

Oh No. Scott and Ethan getting caught up by the hype. Remember guys, until it's in a gamers hands don't trust your eyes. Remember Anthem. Remember No Man's Sky. Sea of Thieves etc.

It really fustrates me when people just assume that a game like this one basically belongs to one gender when that's not the case at all. 

I just can't help but be really offended as a teenage girl who enjoys shooter games. It does not belong to a specific group of people in that way, it is for all people who are comfortable with shooter games. Simple. Don't put a label on it.

BRO HAVE THEM REACT TO BORDERLANDS 3
It's funny how there's talk about 'how this incorporates realism into Ghost Recon', since the series suffered a serious downgrade in realism as it went. I think the closest to realism we last saw from GR were the PC versions of GRAW 1 & 2.
Mk 11 gameplay?

Billie eilish reacts to bad guy choreography by Marissa Heart
Respond!!!
I hate it when people hate on video games with excessive violence, they think it's going to make those of us who play it violent in turn and be a bad influence on us. They don't understand the point of the game, which is to give us an in-depth look at what war is really like and also to escape from reality and be able to do badass shit that we couldn't normally do.
React to the llorona trailer!!
Its interesting because these kinds if games that show the actual brutality of war and focus on realism really hit me, usually i cant take more than an hour without feeling disgusted, if anything it deters me from actual conflict even more.

Great video! Stay safe and God bless!
I subscribed to GMM years ago but never actually watched an episode. I thought it was just going to be boring. But the other month I decided to watch one and now I have been on a major binge. Every day I watch one. Old and new
I love GMM! Watch every single episode and have done for several years now. My first strong memory of them is an old episode that I stumbled on by accident, where they were talking about time travel.
I wonder, does Scott know the Ultimate Question?
people react to something they already know and like...therefore have already experienced. what wonder and surprise will ensue.
the kids who have that guy as a language arts teacher are extremely lucky and they don’t even know it. my language arts teacher was old and wore very similar blue floral dresses every day and she smelled like raw dough.
Scott and Adam are the best!(Oh,and my favorites).
Please react to vanossgaming
Kids react to linkin park
!
what about there music videos
"GMM fans talk about GMM"
I absolutely love GMM/Rhett and Link. I've been watching for years. Their chemistry and friendship is so enduring, not too often can someone say they share a company name with their best friend, someone they have known since 1st grade. Their content is something someone can enjoy at any age. They work hard and deserve all the success. Love being a mythical beast. <3
I think their next big move should be to release a silver screen quality film. They already have a massive understanding about writing and directing, they need to make a film worthy of being shown in all theaters across the nation!

Also, as far as the distant future of GMM goes, I could totally see their kids taking it over and keeping it alive when Rhett and Link become too tired to carry on.
Elders react to Kendrick Lamar DAMN album!! Lyric breakdown too!!
“65 DOLLARS?!”
9:47 Or as Rhett and Link once said: It's still the same old menu, but they keep adding optional sides.
Teens react to discontinued snacks from their childhood
Tori: "They've never had a bad idea."
Me: "You mean except for when they tried to release one video as four, for a season?"

Other than that I agree!
I love LOVE GMM!
Did she just call Rhett and Link "funny old men"? They're only 40!
Absolutely love Rhett and Link!
I used to watch when it was just Rhett and Link on their channel before gmm. When I found out about gmm I didnt know it was their channel at first, it thought they were guest on a random channel but know I'm glad to discover gmm. I love the friendship they have, friendship goals. They are one of me favorite youtubers, they're funny, creative and very talented. They have a very talented awesome crew. They also saved smosh. Rhett and Link just seem like very genuine great guys and I can't wait to see more of them.
This isn't a reaction all of the reactors already knew Rhett and Link pretty much. Not that I'm complaining though :p
Where was Cotton Candy Randy? You cant have GMM without CCR... Daddies.
Everyone should have a teacher like Scott, he seems like a good guy, like someone who's nice and chill and knows how to be with kids/teens but at the same time he seems like he can be quite stern if he has to.
I believe the right wording should be "They saved Smosh"
Love love LOVE GMM!! Been a fan since the Chia Lincoln days, lol! I also just bought my tickets for their summer tour, and decided to get the VIP package so me and my daughter will be meeting them! My daughter was so excited when I told her that she literally cried!! I can't wait to see them!

Where’s the damn human chocolate fountain clip
Anyone who says anything bad about GMM needs to warm that cold heart of theirs.  GMM is something that my whole family enjoys.  Its hard to find something my teen will watch with us.  I believe GMM also bought Smosh so they could continue making skits too. (Ooops, commented before I finished the video and confirmed they bought smosh XD)
It’s crazy how kids react to Rhett and Link was so long ago and now adults are reacting to them again on GMM now
OMGGGGG
(:
It's a adult humor, not as in for adults but they keep it clean in a fashionable yet relatable humor unlike a lot of channels here. Rhett and link are amazing
I’ve been watching them since they were just Rhett & Link and then Good Morning Chia Lincoln. How they don’t hate each other is beyond me lol They’re so different, but I can relate to both of them and they’re both endearing. They are an excellent success story to follow
Love Rhett & Link ♥️♥️ and all the mythical crew 😎
Rhett and Link react to this video c
Been subbed to gmm for so dsmn long, since rhett n link. Finally they're on here!!!

I see good mythical morning, I click
I miss Link’s old hair tooooooo 😭
Before I knew who Rhett and Link were I stumbled onto their, "My favorite pillow" music video. If you haven't seen it, it's absolutely brilliant.
Do everyone reacts to Dope or Nope
My question is, when y’all asked for opinions, there were like 3 people who weren’t in the vid the whole time talkin about “Yea, Rhett and Link are revolutionizing the way we watch the internet” GET YO CAMEO FACE ASS 🤣
I only started watching Rhett and Link what maybe a year ago if that... and I've binged watched EVERY GMM episode and am currently watching every Good Mythical More episode, currently on season 12 episode 39 on that. I will then start catching up on their secondary content after once I'm caught up. This is how awesome they really are.
Please do demolition ranch
Adults react to The Ask Trixie Channel!!  I wanna see people react to ME! :-)

I adore GMM! Long time viewer here. I was actually turned onto them by some of their earliest music videos. I thought their Mc D's commercials & 100 pillows was the best thing I'd ever seen at the time 😂

Edit- & their "field trips"! How could I possibly forget?! Lol They've blown glass, made ice sculptures, tried out a deprivation tank & froze themselves in cryotherapy (where Link admitted to colluding with the Russians for freedom 😂) to name a few

Good Mythical Morning will always be my morning thing. I love the show, everything they do and also and how gracious they are. It is always a nice breath of fresh air to watch, everyday and all days to come.
I would like to see college kids play 1 level of Lord of the Rings on the PS2 and Spyro: A New Beginning on the PS2.
Have them be on their show that would be so cool
Absolutely love GMM...been watching them for about 4 years now. I believe them eating Ghost Peppers was the first video I saw...but it was an episode where they were shocking each other with these big bug zappers that had me in tears laughing so hard...that I stuck around.
Sometimes I forget that Rhett and Link when to my high school and did my commencement speech at my graduation where they brought a Charmander pinata that they made out valedictorian hit with a stick. That was wild.

I'm not a fan of GMM, but I do love Rhett and Link as a comedy duo. Their skits were great and were really at the forefront of YouTube during its initial explosion in popularity. Their contributions to the platform back then should not be looked at as anything other than amazing, and I'm happy they have continued to grow even if it's not necessarily for me.
All of the mythical beats rn:

We know The React Channel did not drop out of law school to become a ventriloquist. And by that we mean you did not disappoint.
Gmm is the best channel ever

I used to watch parodies in 2009-2010 and thats how i discovered rhett and link with their songs to which then i discovered their I love them💜Check out "the break up song" with tessa violet. It warms my heart seeing them on the trending. I did not know they were the ones that bought smosh. Smosh was the first channel i subscribed to.

I understand the superfam thing but I really think they are pushing it to much. It's mentioned nearly every video some how and a lot of times it feels out of place. In some ways it makes you feel like if you're not part of that paid thing you're not supportive enough and your comments don't mean as much. Just my opinion, you don't have to like or agree with it.

Similar to GMM, Wong Fu Productions has been around since the OG days of YouTube, and even before that.

If you had Rhett and Link on Challenge Chalice that would be so OP. You'd have to up the punishment... or have the GMM staff and C-Teamers each choose the worst thing they've had to eat, and then those go into the chalice as the punishment. That would be quite the episode.

I loved GMM but have since left the fold, sick of the 3 adverts per vid and just the constant need to push there own merch too.

I also hate how they dropped from 4 videos per day to 2, it means if they do something you have no interest in your stuck with it for 15 minutes or you just don’t watch.
The Will It videos is my favorite :))
This is the best yasss

Dies he is named robotnik in original?
Weres Amy rose?!
If this movie is supposed to be aimed at children, the question really becomes "what do children think of the trailer?"
If you want to see a sonic movie watch the sonic ova
0:20 I had that exact same reaction watching the trailer
They talk too much while they are watching the trilar!
This is not creating something new. This is making something to draw people in base on nostalgia. Of course they will have to follow fans :p
YOU ARE ALL IDOTS!!!!!!!!!
12:51 I agree but it's like saying that someone else's art is bad  but they think it's good and I'm saying that from experience
Can you make the teens react to this
Joeys reaction is like a pissed mother trying not to yell
these guys need to relax it not that bad besides we got an actual egg man in this movie
People are over reacting.
When you do the best you can,get shat on my basically everybody,promise to fix the issue and get shat on once more....

You know, I think Jirard does has a point of all this: 4:49 6:19 7:02 8:41 12:54 13:33
I was the only one that said the old sonic looked like a fursona. Thank you, Joey.
One bad thing about detectuve pikachu:

Jigglypuff has furr
Come on

Think about Kirby, Jigglypuff is almost identical to Kirby

She has to be a balloon, not an furr'd monster

All films has a bad point

It's. Impossible. To. Have. A. Perfect. Film.
Make someone reaction to LumpyTouch's video:
Movie Sonic wants to talk
Who the duck is this bearded duck with an orange shirt anyways seriously he made no sense after at 8:42 the original creator already has a fan base so the next creator should follow THE ORINGINAL CREATION PERIOD WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!??
Thats dope yall got faze rug
Brandon rogers always speaked truth i dont sxpect anything less
The guy in the blue shirt is hilarious .
they say they gonna redesign sonic....what if they are redesigning tails too?! and they didnt show the trailer yet and they already messed up! make sense?
i think when jeff fowler (director) design sonic he was challenging himself with memory designing, so basically when he design it he never saw how sonic look but but rather using his memory to think of how sonic look like if u know what i mean and (by the way sorry for the bad grammer, IF my grammer are bad)
gotta go fast? gotta go fast back in time and make sure we prevent it before it happens

Dangmattsmith: WHERE IS TAILS!?!

Tell me.. how did u get faze rug to be in this
Okay. When I saw pikachu, I was very dissapointed about so much realism they have put like I wished Pikachu would have more like actual anime like Pikachu eyes like I felt Pikachu was already too Americanized. Buuuuut Sonic here is straight up nightmare fuel. Like making Pikachu looks good. Like sonic is just sooooo bad lol
0:21 when the teacher says you have an exam today
Can we start a petition to have Brandon not be in these videos anymore
If youre gonna make a Sonic movie do a cartoon or 1 of those shitty Disney and Dreamworks cg animated style of movies set in Sonic's world not ours. Even if they fix the design the movie isnt gonna be good, might sell a few more tickets though.
Also, what the fuck is with the rings? No! No no no! Bad!
What pisses me off about Sonic's design is that SONIC'S ARMS ARE FUCKING BLUE!😤
But how would sonic look without teeth tho???
Blue man group prob designed him
The og sonic movie is better tbh its animated
There saying that its gonna take so much money 




But sega has so much over the years
I must say that I like that they listened to the fans insted of calling them names and belittling them, it's a breath of fresh air in this day and age. The biggest difference when it comes to the genie in Aladdin is that Disney is too big to need to care about what the fans really want, they can push out what they want and if said movie doesn't make as much as they thought they can always make that up with the next movie they make, also it's not like Disney's short on money so that they can't take a loss...
5:05 one of my art friend's also did the same thing
I just realized that no one commented how Sonic has a neck now. SONIC ORIGINALLY HAS NO NECK. Another detail OG fans would see instantly
Brandon Rogers jacket was made out of a beach umbrella from Florida

What's the next game they're gonna make into a live action movie?

Mario? Splatoon? Whatever it is, it better look like it.
WTH happened to anthony's hair lol
I agree 100,000,000% with Brandon. Whoever approved it needs to be fired and then shot...repeatedly. Sonic is super creepy and way too anthropomorphized.
You haven't seen the blue electricity wtf man
Pikachu looks like pikachu. Sonic looks like a person in a furry costume.
I can't imagine remaking Sonic is going to do enough to be worth the money.

Lmao who said go watch sonic for sonic? I'm going to go watch it for Jim Carrey
I mean the animation is not that bad, I don't know why directors and animators have to listen to so much hate, if the new sonic design is exactly like the videogame kind then ill be just like the haters and complain about THAT
Sonic 06 was better than this
Watch your mouthes
Smith: NO MORE TEETH NO MORE TEETH

Sonic: How am I able to eat hotdogs then...
I'd rather play sonic 06, sonic boom, and forces in one day than watch this fucking trailer
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I couldn't stop laughing when I saw this and I did agreed with your opinions.
We need to include Brandon more, hi reactions never disappoints me :)

I think he looks  cool
Omgosh yall need to chill
Some people think the studio is using a ‘New Coke’ marketing approach with this movie. Intentionally making the early draft bad, to get people talking about it, all while they already have a ‘good’ completed film done, that they will release later that will make it seem like they worked so much harder for the fans, and if anything people will 100% go see just to see if it’s as bad as the trailer made it look to be.
Ok so here is the full story on Sonic’s design: 
• 1st brought it to SEGA-said they didn’t like it-producers overruled them & did it anyway. 
• 2nd tried it with test groups -said they didn’t like it-producers overruled them & did it anyway.
• 3rd released the promo poster to the public -said they didn’t like it-producers overruled them & did it anyway.
• 4th released the trailer to the public-social media blew up saying how much they didn’t like it- producers “we had no idea no one didn’t like it, so now we’re gonna change it to make you the fans happy.”
So, my understanding is that Sonic released a cd in the 90’s & the 1st song was Gansta’s Paradise....so thats’s sappost to be the tie in
I love Brandon Rogers
Jirard!! My man! I love ya!
Holy shit Brandon Rogers calm the fuck down
So your gonna complain and have them redesign sonic costing millions of dollars and peoples time to make it happen but your not gonna go see it in theaters???? Woww
For me the best design of Sonic is from Sonic adventure or the anime Sonic X
14:12 think I’m gonna skert skert off the fucking road 😅😂 yikes
Chris Klemens and Brandon Rogers have very punchable faces.
Прекрасный выпуск, все сорта долбоебов в наличии
Where's Ian ☹☹☹
We now know the power they are giving us
My worst fear is that paramount is gonna put so much time and effort into this fix, and people are still gonna hate it. I guarantee they aren't gonna fix it the third time. Be happy with what you have!
"I don't think its that bad."
"I mean, he's not that bad!"
"ugh... this is where it all falls apart... REALLY falls apart."
Brandon Rogers's 0:20 reaction perfectly describes everyone's feelings about this movie.
As a member of the "younger audience",  I was utterly repulsed by this trailer
How the hell did he escape hundreds of missile and he couldn't escape one dart
anyone that says "i dont think its that bad" is attracted to the Grinch or the awful kind of furry. If the grinch absorbed Sonic, thats what he'd look like. Ya'll need standards. -
You should do youtubers react to Aminé
I hated the old animation a song I'd like the new version of Sonic it looks better
“They didn’t consult with any of the fans”

They didn’t consult with the original creators of Sonic The Hedgehog!

Dangmattsmith  I love to watch your videos
Faze rug on here
My favorite person in this video is Brandon. XD
0:19 XD
My theory is that they have a better design for Sonic but they wanted to make the movie popular so they put this bad design out knowing the internet would blow it out
I hate everyone, that hates Sonic The Hedgehog I love this movie no matter what! It my dream come ture💙Whos with me🖐

My only problem with the movie is sonic's design...
Why is there so much hate around the trailer
"Why is he wearing melted dentures" Haha never thought of it that way
Wait is there a kid in your bag yes but not mine

2:00 really!? Are you even a sonic fan or do you even recognized the original?
i don't care when people hate sonic look. PLZ STOP, SONIC IS NOT THAT BAD!
1:01 Thats so true 👏👌
The trailer music choice was just terrible....
This is way better https://youtu.be/lZZ81RanvDE
I wonder what Sammy sonic fan thinks about this movie
:/ when will you guys start getting reactors to watch trailers as they come out, instead of after everyone, including most of your reactors have already seen it?
2:00 THEY. DO. NOT. GET. IT. AT ALL
I fuckig died at Brandon’s freak out at the beginning
Everything wrong with sonic:
Eyes aren’t connected
Eyes just... eyes
Doesn’t have the gloves but instead human hands
...






Teeth.
To skinny not thick enough I mean like he looks a lil more thick to me...
And umm... that’s it I guess
“I mean it’s not that bad”
Me:
WAIT IS THAT FAZE RUG?
Brandon Rogers AND Stevie from GMM? awesome choice!! loved the episode

OOF !!!!
0:19 his reaction got me dead😂😂
2:42 Yes, Joey, and I don't remember anyone asking for you to be here either, yet here we are!
React to sonic the hedgehog
IT'S NOT THAT BAD
Sonic looks like Sonics crackhead cousin Ponic
I don’t get how y’all gonna say you hate it when the guy who made it worked so hard to make this. Like it’s more realistic. But right now y’all telling me that y’all would rather him have his eyes touching. Y’all are ungrateful just in joy the damn movie I mean like it just a movie a the creator worked so hard to make it so fuck everyone how said it was bad
5:40 make the arms tan and give him gloves and he looks perfect oh and make his stomach tan too
I love how people voice their hate to Sonic's design while ignoring the not so good other parts of the movie: like the dialogues, the music choice, the bizarre plot that the trailer gave.
Paramount fixing Sonic's design ain't gonna stop this movie to suck honestly.
Thank God that other viewers understood it.
I feel like this isn't so much a sonic movie as it is an eggman origin story
If he dodges all the missles how does he dodge the freaking poison DART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Other than the design, and the choice of song, this movie looks okay
Fixing the design of the character will not make the movie better. The movie itself also looks like shit.
Remember the movie Hop? This is it now. Feel old yet?
Jim Carey fix’s about 29% of the whole thing the fact that he is the best thing of the whole trailer
Sonic is so bad that you don't notice what's bad
I bet next they will make a lengend of Zelda live action movie
I still dont understand what is bad with Sonic
Like if Sonic needs to be fixed asap?
2:56 Sonic "ZA WARDO"
You know what im scared of? 
Live action Toy story.
I hate people when they hate something they should not say it cause it might hurt their feelings they should just keep the word inside there brain
I don't think why people hate it so much??? Like he actually looks REALLY cute to me lol
2019: The year of bad CGI characters. First was the genie & then sonic & maybe there’s more I’m not sure. There was that Dora movie or whatever so I think that counts. Pokémon Detective Pikachu’s trailer was released last year so it doesn’t count for this year IMO.
OMG 😂
They need to use something close to the 2006 design.
Jim Carry is going to save this film of the redisign doesn't
To that guy in red shirt
it is NOT a creation, Paramount ISN´T creating Sonic, its a model based on an EXISTING character, just like Pikachu, its not because of "Nintendo and Pokemon Pikachu" directives, its just because THATS PIKACHU not a "creation"


Edit: Just as Anthony said on 
Sammy - "WhY dO wE NeEd A LiVe aCtIoN sOnIc MoVie??!! wHy DO wE nEeD tHaT??!!! wHY??!!!! WHYYYYY!!!!!!!!??? TELL MEEEEEE!!!!!!!"
0:20 this is me when I saw the trailer
7:24 this is me when I saw the design
Next live action movie is probably gonna be Mario
Faze rug
My mom: dinner is ready
Me: ok, can you close my door?
My mom: ok,
My mom: leaves door open
Me: 
How come no one is mentioning one big issue with The Sonic movie. The actual plot compared to Pikachu's movie. The plot looks bland and Like every kids cheesy action movie. The pokemon can actually build a decent story line and leaves you wondering what the movie will be about while for sonic- its very obvious and quite a waste of time to even watch.

Jim Carrey makes it better though
reaction world was a better idea
Brandon Rogers is my spirit animal
Brandon WAS ABOUT TO MURDER THAT LAPTOP.......
Yay Kelsey was on youtubers react.  All I want now is to see Lily Marston

Kelsey !!!💕

I think the movie is going to be good but I agree they needs to change his design
In my opinion I dont feel hes that bad but I can see the mishaps he has all though I'm still stoked for the movie
elders react surreal entertainment
i dont think people understand that they are trying to put sonic into a realistic modern world as we are today. they are trying to make the character look practical for today's time. all the fixes that people have made on their own and say they are better, look too comicy. the point is though, if u just put a straight up comicy looking sonic into a film like this, its gonna look so bad. so although this sonic in the trailor isnt completely accurate to a comicy looking sonic, it is still pretty accurate and people will understand who it is. and i think the most important element is the reality of this character being put into a modern movie like we have today. the design they chose best fits a realistic concept
Omg it’s coming on my birthday
Is the guy from 27 dresses in it?
“I’m getting to heated”😂
When rug said his design is not that bad I said good joke rug
Dont invite Faze rug back
it took me a hot second to realize Stevie was in this xD
Jim is gonna Carrey the movie
How can sonic dodge missiles but can't dodge a dart???
i’m gonna go see this just to make fun of it the entire time
Tails is not in the movie. This movie is an origin movie.
I actually want to see this
Why wasn't Arin Hanson on this???
"he's not that bad"
please say sike
0:19 when you rush to the other room to charge your phone and it shuts down just when you are about to plug it in
„I don’t remember anyone asking for this“ 😂😂😂
What did they do to poor sonic😩
I am not a Sonic or Pokemon fan, to be honest and I wasn't wanting either but I thought the Pokemon one sounded like a good story so now I'm excited to see it
This is such a comedy i can't stop laughing and when sonic said mew with this bizarre design i died.....
I only liked one Sonic show... and it was Sonic Underground. Am I alone?
I hate everyrhing about that Chris.
I CAME FOR KELSEY
get the misfits on to react with the others to misfits vlog videos
Lol
2:13 oh nonono lol
This movie is NOT going to age well !!!

And I think every single person can agree !!!
I think it's because Sonic doesn't get the respect he deserves and the ones making the movie don't really give Sonic the respect he deserves either. So the movie doesn't get the same care and treatment to make as good a movie. No one is gonna mess up freakin Pokemon. lol
Dreadful absolutely dreadful
EWWWWW! That’s fucking horrible!!!! NOOOO! What have they done!
Jim carry is the only good thing
Im sorry but just f*ck that bald guy with the gray shirt.
Live action mickey mouse?😬😬
13:57
this gave me nightmares😂😂😂
lmaoooo the blue and white shirt guy was pissseddd asff lmaoo
I like the guy that looked at it from both sides. Imo, the first designed wasn't nearly as bad as people made it seem, but could def be improved.
Brandon's reaction at 0:20
Jirard doesn't react, he releases statements... lol.
4:05
Okay, can we stop saying this as if it's some excuse for shitty movies being shitty?
Brandon Rogers is a gift even if he's not in his own videos. He's always funny no matter who's video he is in
Audiences are the consumers and stuff like movies are products. If the companies wanna profit from their creations they need to make a product thats good quality and people want. I mean they can make a shitty movie if they want but can’t say shit when is does bad and gets negative criticisms. When you put your work or art out there for the public you are opening yourself up to criticism
"How do you make a movie for Sonic?"

turns on the OVA
I disagree with completionist, if an audience does not like something they do not have to pay for it. Therefore, I think that telling the creator that his work can be better is a much better solution.
If you want complete creative freedom, you can do it. BUT you cannot expect the audience to like it.
This is how I feel about the haters of this movie if y'all have a problem with go fix it yourself like these people have work hard to give y'all what you want and y'all just keep complaining about what do y'all expect that have to animate A FUCKING BLUE WALKING AND TALK HEGHOG Y'ALL NEED TO GROW UP AND LEARN THAT THINGS TAKES TIME TO DO OMFG
The problem nobody sees is that fixing this probably means a bunch of artists are going to be overworked and burnt out because they have to crunch the new Sonic design within a more limited amount of time.
Ion care who sees it just show people the sonic gangsters paradise amv its 10 years old and amazing
0:19
@ 4:50 ummmm it worked with Roger Rabbit so yah, it would be
I jist realized sonic said "your planet" like hes from the same planet man...
6:56
0:18
sonic looks like 1 and 2 from cat and the hat movie
I have to watch this movie because my dad said if I watched the sonic movie with him the I could watch endgame for free I shouldn’t have taken the offer
When I went to the movies to see detective pikachu the trailer for Sonic came on and the whole theatre shrieked, " Oh noooooo!!"
Sonic looks weird.
3:06 was how i felt when i heard about the changes.
Sonic looks terrifying and I wrote a song about it - https://youtu.be/v-HNoz2YET0
i was abit confused, was the woman saying she liked the design of sonic?
one of the guys were raging about the trailer so much that i laughed so hard XD
MATTDANGSMITH asking the right questions: "Where's Tails?"
Just watched detective Pikachu
ANTHONY
If your basing a movie off a franchise like Sonic, you as a filmmaker need to do your research on it and keep the original source material while making up a story around it at the same time. But if you make a movie that’s not based off a franchise, the story and design can be whatever you want because it is yours.
there are some things that should be made in real life... like sonic the hedgehog and pokemon
0:20 Everyone when they first saw the full trailer
omg literally all meh fav ytbers r in this vid
Amma be honest but I just clicked because of Rug
I'm hoping the new sonic looks like the original version, but with the spikes that the horrible one has
They are gonna fix it
You know they messed up when they gave him teeth and changed his iconic shoes.
The way I see it is they want to make a great Sonic movie.  That's great and all but there's a huge fan base of it both young and older alike, and if they're not pleasing to the eye, the movie suffers a financial disaster.  Sonic should look more how he does in the game.  I think it's a smart move on the director's part.  I could be wrong as there's certainly been bad calls on this sort of thing before cough Spiderman 3 cough
Feel like it’s trendy to hate on this movie.
I'm ready for Jacksfilms to shitpost for 8 months and get invited to the premiere
What the fuck is this why do we need live action everything let’s leave it a fucking cartoon.  So true
He really doesn't look that bad tbh.
Fans: Do you know who Sonic is 
Paramount: uhhhhh...... Meow?
That sonic made me vomit
Sonic looks terrible the movies gonna get rated ✨❌❌❌❌
3rd times a try for sonic right....right😬
They did it on a purpose
If I were a cynical person I'd say they did it on purpose so they would have much more publicity.
AND I BET IF SONIC WAS ACTUALLY REAL AND SEEING THAT MOVIE HE WOULD BE SO FREAKING DISAPPOINTED LIKE COME ON I THOUGHT STUDIO PEOPLE DO THEIR BEST THIS ISNT THEIR BEST!!!!!!!!!! 😣😣😣
To be honest, I believe Sonic looks yes, off. And yes, not like the games! Remember the Boom games? People were mad Sonic had bandages and a bandana. A BANDANA! THIS SONIC JUST HAS A HEIGHT DIFFERENCE AND A HUMAN LIKE LOOK?! Seriously! It'll cost them so much to redesign! You guys made the creators the audience! Really, there's not too much of an issue. Yes, I am a Sonic fan, but that doesn't mean I have to hate hate hate! Especially when everyone on the internet left and right judge everything so critically.
All I can say is that Ben Schwartz and Jim Carey and the other great actors in the movie don't deserve the torture of being involved with this. I hope they got paid a LOT
0:23
same
Yesss u guys got faze rug! More faze rug in these videos plz
OK all the YouTube is an video  got one thing right where the  Hell is tails and the rest of the gang and they need to have sonic recreated I don’t care how much it has costed for them yes it might be a little too much but they got one thing right there is not no sonic the hedgehog with all his original features and the rest of his crew👿👿👿👿
I personally like the Sonic movie trailer. It looks like a pretty epic movie, & I absolutely love Jim Carrey as Eggman. All they need to change is the model for Sonic.
People must hate blue CGI shit
What the fuck is wrong with the psycho in the blue striped shirt?
Do adults react to It chapter 2 trailer.
Whelp time to watch sonic cutscenes
Ryan Reynolds is so happy that he acted for Pikachu and not Sonic
They need to redesign everything
I  feel so sad cause almost everybody  is mean to sonic
2:14 
SONIC LOOKS LIKE THE MONKEY BOY FROM JUMANJI (the original)
I don’t think it looks too bad.  I’d go & see it.
They forgot about teils!!


Maybe it’s good
It's the legs and the teeth.
The team redesigning Sonic deserve a raise for having to waste their time. In fact, delay the movie to give them more time.
Damn stop clap complaining clap
I don't think the Sonic movie is also for kids since they had a child kidnapping joke in the trailer, when Sonic was in the bag and all that. Sonic isn't the only one trying to find his identity, the movie is also trying to find its identity, it doesn't know what demographic it wants to appeal to the most, the fans, the kids or adults
They look like melted dentures that what was brilliant
Anybody else think Sonics a little skinny
Thankfully they are redesigning him! The trailer wasn't horrid, except for the design of Sonic and the creators heard everyone and are making him look more like his original self.
F
Sammiclassicsonicfan has left the chat
Anthony and chris😍😍😍
Jim Carrie is Eggman!?
They fall right in the uncanny valley
2:11 this is how I felt
I think it looks great.
Paramount: *makes live-action Sonic*
Everyone: "Nobody cares!"
Everyone: "Go ahead ask us if we care."
Paramount: "Do you care?"
Everyone: "No, but thank you for asking."
Everybody’s just here for Jim Carrey
Tbh, whether or not they re-design him, the movie still looks ass so might as well just keep it how it is
0:19 Brandon Rogers is EVERYONE in the meme community
THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A FURRY FUCKIN COSTUME !  If you think that is what a furry wares yall is on crack
Someone ins the staf will be fired XD
1:04 Chris I 100% agree with u
There must be something else going on in Brandon’s life Jesus
Does anyone else feel bad for the producer and director?  Like they really thought they were making a really good movie and probably were really happy with what they created, but then they ended up getting all of this shit. I can’t imagine what they must be feeling rn
Brandon Rogers
4:39 
Her: it’s not that bad 
Me: ... inhales aggressively let’s look at the photo one more time
But why is Brandon me 0:21 when I first saw the trailer
Hey... that was the demo version poeple
I can smell the (Sonics design is good) defence squad
This movie is gonna win all the oscars. They shouldn’t redesign him because then the movie won’t win “best visual effects”
Hatch has all you guys need to chill about the Sonic the Hedgehog movie on the speaking up for myself about this movie Let It chill in the Sonic Underground Sonic the Hedgehog just had tape in the cartoon but you guys. See that bummer for the old G like really OG fan he just he have teeth in a cartoon butt in the air animation one which they could try to make it real Ash possible they can be but you guys are making me lose my mind about the song hi movie LOL got to go fast but please got to go chill chill with the movie and stay calm cuz am I going to take a lot to fix up the design like you maybe maybe the might give you some tests or something got to go chill
I can't believe anybody will do this when the trailer is fine but he we want to be like kind of like detective Pikachu but I don't know I hope that sets the Sonic Millie I'm wearing just gone console on a money and put it in a dim it's going to be so hard but the Creator for Sonic the Hedgehog call take a lot of instead and I just worrying that said for that this is hashtag got to go fast I guess but had Chad I don't know I hope characters I all I can see tails are in a Rouge or any character or maybe Tails and Knuckles I did keatas I don't know for the song the Hedgehog movie kind of bum or Buzz kind of cool I like I got Jim Carrey in it amazing but  to go fast
It's not that bad kind of cute adorable but Nike the color are the Lions but I kind of asked for this
Me a kind of Afro I actually but not like this
While yes, the design in *horrendous*, I don't think the movie looks that bad. Sure no one asked for it and of course everyone is getting sick of live action movies being made of cartoons but I've always thought it's rather cool and refreshing. Let's be honest, they could have done so much worse with actual story and characters. I think with the redesign this could shape up to be a pretty interesting movie! Maybe not great but it'll be fun to watch :D
Omg Stevie is in this yay!
well detective Pikachu has pretty low ratings so :I
Can you make youtuber react to the history of popular meme
Unless this was a purposeful publicity stunt: A lot of people need to be fired!
I'm so for Jim Carrey and that's about it.
why are movies tryna make everything so f u r r y
sonic looks like a midget in a furry costume
Ohhh faze rug is in this video
Complainers.
Anthony: I can’t wait to see the new version! 
Me: https://youtu.be/oTyxJPaQg3A
1:05 hes mad cause it's a live action film that's not the main problem
0:21-0:23 when finals are in 1 week
Me: is alive
Nobody:
Literally nobody:




Sonic: 
Why are all the comments less than an hour ago.
Jim Carrey is the only saving grace in this terrible horrible movie
The sonic movie should have not been made
And then theres me my name is genesis
I saw Anthony Padilla that used to be from Smosh in this video
2:44 Little does he know the majority of Sonic fans want another Sonic movie but animated.
Doctor: you have 15:00 minutes to live!
Me: ThIZ ViDeO!
"I hope they have to pay so much fucking money to FIX IT" AHAGEGSNAVA BRANDON
Spoilers Jim Carrey Is doctor eggman
React to yung gravy?
0:53 YO IT'S DATTMATTSMITH
Sonic be looking like a demonic chucky cheese
Excuse me? What on earth? THIS IS NON-REASONABLE HATE! Also I agree with the completionist.
The movie is based off the sonic gangsters paradise youtube video
Can you do a reacts to ProJared?
I also just thought of this: As a "90s kid", there was always the rivalry between Mario and Sonic. We all know how bad the live action Mario movie is. The question is, will Sonic's movie be worse?
I feel so bad for the company they will lose lods of money
What's the difference between a studio interfering with a film's creation and the fanbase interfering? The fanbase knows the characters and the world of the franchise better. The Warcraft movie didn't get a good reaction from normal moviegoers, but from what I heard, the fanbase loved it. Another point I'd like to make here is that, Detective Pikachu, which I have not personally seen yet but which my brother and sister (who are more fans of pokemon than I am) loved, was made by The Pokemon Company, the literal company that makes the games, etc. The Warcraft film was also made by Blizzard (if I remember correctly). I think there is a message/lesson here.
Stevie is seriously on some drugs even she thinks this version is okay...
insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
eyes, mouth, body . Gotta fix fast.
Artistic freedom. At the end of the day the director could have chosen to do nothing. The decision was his to rework Sonic to make the majority of people happy with the design. I think he made the right decision and as a result a lot more people are going to enjoy the result as opposed to releasing it as it was with far more disappointment.
This might be foreshadowing for future movies where the public gets to vote on how movies look. Some directors might even commission talented fan artists that are admired by the public. And it could essentially create new jobs for artists. It seems promising.
matt! wassup
Stevie!
Smosh would’ve made a pretty good skit back in the days
no one asked for this movie god did not even know it was coming
7:22 - 7:46 
I laughed so hard XD
SpongBob, My Little Pont,Pickachu, a Dora, ans Sonic movie whats next?




Barney the Dinosaur Movie 👌
this guy watched the trailer already he suffered like I did when I saw sonic 0:20 and really the song gangsters paradise...BRUH! And I came up wait a name sonic with his new friend ponic
ppl really reacting to this movie is my me me laugh and even make me hate sonic the more i like the cartoon but not the movie
At 0:20 though, I literally thought he was gonna break the laptop
i love brandon omg
The guy in the red shirt is the most reasonable I think.
Brandon is me lol
WHY DOES ANTHONY LOOK LIKE JON SNOW
forsenCD My Man
wheres tails?! wheres Amy?! Wheres Knuckles?!
No no!
picachu's  movie verses sonic...You all know whos gonna win
the completionist is a contrarian shitbag.
this movie broke brandons poor little heart  😔
Sonic design: 1/10
Jim carrey in sonic movie: -100000000/10
They should’ve made a fully animated sonic movie like the opening cutscene of sonic unleashed.
React to Dora the movie
Put colleen Ballinger
Forget about the Sonic design; THE COMEDY IS AWFULLLLL
Faze rug
So many youtubers
Brandon speaks my mind
Brandon sums it up pretty well
Director: so how do you want  The Teeths look like
SEGA : Yes
when the youtubers just go OH MY GOOOOOOOOOSHHH
Were just going to ignore the producers are the same as Fast and Furious
Who came here for Dangmattsmit and Anthony Padilla?
SEGA: Makes A Sonic Movei Probably Costes Shit Tone Of Money..
Everybody: im about to end this companys whole carrer
I wish there were more traditionally animated films
Is it only me but I love it 💀
It not really that bad about sonic but about the legs
8:45 Its a recreation not a creation. So we have the right to say something. If it was a creation then we cant have the say so because thats how the directed created. But Sonic has already been created....
Anthony is a fucking crybaby istg
If people likes the trailer I'll be so pi$$ed😠
I love Brandon Rogers’ intensity throughout the video 😂
How can i not watch if jim carey is there. Just fix it... pls..
Can y'all do a reaction to the live action pikachu movie😁
Some of these Youtubers overracted way too hard to this and they find the most feminine dudes to react...
Jim Carrey is going to be the one to save this movie.
Dang Matt Smith is right were is tail 

Thank for the 2 like
Holy crap I just noticed that’s Stevie from GMM!
I agree with everything that guy in red said
its not just  the legs it's the shoes
What is wrong with you guys Sonic the Hedgehog is great there's nothing wrong with him there's something wrong with you. 😒😒😒
Yesss bradon Rodgers.
i posted on FB years ago but "ANIME,CARTOON,GAME,BOOK,ORIGINAL CREATION,ETC SHOULD BE LEAVE THE FUCK ALONE AND NOT BEING MAKE INTO LIVE ACTION JUST BCS YOU CAN'T BE CREATIVE TO COME OUT WITH SOMETHING NEW FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY"
3:07 they must
STOPPPPPPPP U FUCKING ASSHOLES
"gotta go fast!"
REACT : No one can beat us


FBE : Am I a joke to you?
Matt Dang Smith:Get that outa here
"I don't remember asking for this" mood about most movies in 2019
even if it was animated, wreck it ralph still did a better job in designing sonic than the live-action movie.
Plot twist they designed it horribly to create a huge buzz and have people wanna see the redesigned version 👀
Anyone who hates Jim Carry(or Carey how ever the f*** you spell it) has never had a soul to begin with in their damn life.(also is that how you spell his last name? I never knew how to spell it sry)
It may cost a lot of money to fix it. But if they fix it more people will watch the movie.
One of the biggest overreactions on the internet this year has been about this trailer.
Why are people complaint about sonica teeth but not the mcu aliens talking English and having normal teeth as well.
React to IT CHAPTER 2
Brandon & Chris can own my ass whenever. They're opinions are on point!
Wow ian was in a fbe vid
Reedisign Sonic is the only thing they NEED to do
Maybe its gitta be a great movie but.. When i see sonic i wanna delete him from like foreever i mean WTF!!!  Sonics legs teeth everything hes a hetchhog not a human hetchog whAaAaAt
This trailer looks like the next Marvel movie.
Live action Sonic is the best!!!
-Change my mind by leaving a like
React to the Sega Dreamcast. It is the console's 20th anniversary.
i watched pikachu because pikachu is RYAN REYNOLDS
They need to react to the Doom song from Invader zims for an hour
Brandon Rodgers is SUCH A MOOOOOOOD love himmmm
0:19 when they fix Sonic and it got worst
This is considered torture
THEY’RE NOT YOUTUBERS, THEY’RE INFLUENCERS
- 🤣
I would looooove to sit down with Jarard and have a discussion about creators and their audience! It’s such an important topic for modern entertainment. Though this time the audience is asking for something Very specific — not to mention Sonic is an already realized character with a solid design. This is not Hollywood’s creation, it’s their adaptation. No Sonic doesn’t ‘belong’ to the fans, but they seem to care more about his success then the creators do sometimes.
THE STUPID BLUE ARMS
Is it bad that I unironically love the Sonic trailer? It's so insane that I loved it. It's the trailer that I would have put together when I was a kid in the '90s. I hate to say it but the trailer had me at Gangsta's Paradise.
React to the new ff7 trailer!!
lmfao Rotten Tomatoes, you mean there's still people who actually trust them?
diees
MOMMY IM SCARED
Jim Carrey this whole movie
I love the sonic movie
Everyone: Oh my god. NO!
Brandon: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
The whole creator creates creative license nonsense is just that. 

Sonic is an established character with plenty of reference material. A lot of updates over time but his features have been relatively consistent.

The design choices for the movie were terrible.
FAZE RUG
Jeff Fowler said they’re changing Sonic’s design. You guys can chill out
I think when this movie finally comes out there is going to be a lot of comparing between detective Pikachu in this movie. Detective Pikachu on how to do a live-action video game movie well and Sonic on how to screw up a video game movie
Unless they're going to redo the entire film to make it good to me it doesn't matter what Sonic looks like if the movie itself overall is still going to be crappy. So I don't understand why they're wasting the money on redoing Sonic when Sonic's only a minor problem with the movie.
i like how Brandon Rogers had a mental breakdown the moment he knew what he was watching
Detective Pikachu : Earns a lot of money
Sonic : why not we do a live-action movie and make him like a human ?
Came for Faze Rug
Literally my mom : 1:03
I bet those 6 poeple are probably still gonna watch sonic they just too negative for the video but still sonic is shit looks like a hybrid between Mickey mouse and cookie monster
The guy in the blue is hilarious!! Bring him back every time 😂😂
Well I agree that Sonic did not look like Sonic in the trailer I would also say that the look of Sonic is not the only problem with this movie it looks like it's just going to be in overall bad movie it mean we will appeal to kids and not to the people who grew up with Sonic
this would definitely bother me way more if i was a hardcore sonic fan
IMSO HAPPY THEY'RE CHANGING HIS DESIGN
I like Matt's shirt
‘’IM NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN,BUT YOU NEED TO LOSE YOUR JOB,,
Almost everything was wrong in this trailer!
Sonic looked horrible, and Gangster's paradise was not a good song to use!
"Super sonic racing"  ""Follow me" "Green hill zone!" anything from a Sonic game!
Also, these reactions are on point!
Anthony you were in this video cool

P.s I love your videos
I had dayjavo while watching this video (I’m aware I spelled it wrong)😅
12:37 this boi said like 8 times
1:25 everyone tbh
The guy who wearing blue stripes is extra. He is too dramatic dude OA much
Give the blue Hedgehog a break man SOINC did a lot of crap for over 25 year  I think the creator of Sega should be disappointed to their self . pay  respected more for soinc
Jim carry is going to carry the movie
I’m with DangMattSmith WHERE THE HECK IS MY BOY TAILS THOUGH
0:20 4 year old me when I drop my ice cream








I share his pain
FAZE RUGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE PRODUCERS NEED HELP!!! FiX iT PlEaSe
Am I the only one who wonders why the frick he says meow when he is a hedgehog
Why has no one mentioned that at 2:47 sonic basically opens a sling ring portal. I am feeling incredible pain
jesus christ, where do you find this guys. throw them in the bin were they belong.
Don't know who Stevie Wynne Levine is...but she looks like she could survive The Walking Dead apocalypse for a long time.
NEW TRAILER - https://youtu.be/HSgfA2epZys
"im not trying to be mean but you need to lose your job"
I hate that people are actually hyped about this
Please react to Sabrina Carpenter
Joey said wait for it to come out on vhs. 😂😂😂
Jim Carrey is gonna CARREY THIS MOVIE
stevie is getting popular these days
No one in that video could do better as entertainers y'all ahould know what it like to have haters over react
You can't put that goofy cartoon looking thing in real life
I don't think it's that bad
Everyone: TEETH! TEETH!! TEEEEETTH!!!😆😠😬
8:42 If the creator is confident that the audience will at least EVENTUALLY come around to accepting the creation, then it ought to stand by what was made. But if it wants to get PAID, give the audience what it WANTS.
So thatsss where anthony went...
0:19 When you dropped your McDonald’s
FaZe rug: "It's not that bad"

Also FaZe rug: Looks like Sonic animation
Those legs
Its not sonic its sconic
The only interesting thing at all about this is Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik.
It does look like they were making this movie to appeal to kids, but in doing so, you're making a movie to appeal to people who have never played the games, and who have almost zero connection to the character.
all this bs crying for something you pay only 6-12 dollars to go see and most of yall are just going to pirate. -_-
0:18 When you get Homework on the last day of school.
it isnt called live action for a reason lol
Only two of the girls were excited
Is Jim Carrey Dr Eggman
Those human traits got me real aggressive
I love the sonic trailer
FBE: YouTubers react to Sonic
Me: who TF are these people
9:28 really? those two don't get how movies work. how many time do movie makers ask how every lead looks to people who played the games or read the books. and the other guy saying all these thing show how sonic should look. -_- 80% OF THE THINGS HES IN HE LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS!
0:03 sums the whole trailer up pretty well
Jim is the only cool think in the movie
it not that bad. the guy in the red shirt gets it. its not that real, go yell about the damn president -_-
Have teens or adults react to the Hulu show The Act and the Gypsy Rose Blanchard case.
Its
So good

Plus Jim Carey’s in it
I love the sonic movie
us: WE HATE SONIC’S DESIGN
Dangmattsmith: WHERE IS TAIL’S
I couldn't care less. I'm an adult ffs. Why am I even watching this?
Hey vagita how many childhoods were disinagrated in the new sonic movie

Vigeta: Its over 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What I wanna know is how many people did that character design get past without anyone saying anything?
Try not to get mad challenge
Jirard!❤
Sonic is a part of a lot of people's childhoods. I understand why they're upset about the design, I am too, but I do think this is a little out of hand. Think about how long and hard the animators will now have to work on redesigning sonic for the viewers liking :/
dangmattsmith is here AY
I really don't mind the look of Sonic, honestly the fan base has drawn some much worse adaptation of a hedgehog before.
NOW you know how we feel
💙
First Pokémon now Sonic?
The difference between pikachu and sonic is that sonic fans haven't gotten any good content since SA2B
1:02 this guy is me but I love the trailer
Do any of them know that they're gonna redesign Sonic-- 4:36 wait what'd you say?
You can uh... let the people not suffer in a anti-suffer area

Wait it's not an anti-suffer area
0:19 my reaction
TAILS BETTER BE IN THIS MOVIE
What the hell?! Why does faze rug have less than 1 minute of screen time??!
1:02 He summed it up perfectly.
Sonic as a character and a franchise has been floundering for years at this point. Honestly, this is just the latest in a series of disappointments
Y’all people are weird,,, this is not terrible 😕
NO MORE TEETH!
At 0:20 is pretty much the same way I reacted
Here’s the thing people don’t understand you can make a character look like the old character the way he’s suppose to and still make him fit love it or hate it detective Pikachu did great at making all the Pokémon look like they are suppose to but look like they belong at the same time
I kinda like the design
1:55 no way is that shroud
"It's not THAT bad I mean before he didn't look awesome" alright you need to die now
Jim Carey is the only reason I will watch this 






when it’s available on Netflix
Nobody:

Me: Anthony’s hair is making him more of Jason Momoa but whiter and less muscular.

( Side Note: Srry Anthony, we still love you ❤️😂😍 )
Cant want to see new sonic
Pickacho is good sonic not so good
he is THAT BAD guys -_- for real.
pauses at 0:23 This is hilarious.
This is why you need to show people the character design before you make an entire movie.
Do try not to get mad and some of rhem would be of sonic
I've always loved Brandon Rogers for his crude jokes and brutal honesty, and this time he's really outdone himself. He and just about everyone else are speaking the words we all wanted to say.
I think they did it on purpose, because NOW EVERYONE is hyped and talking about the movie... genius marketing
Everyone was more excited by Jim Carrey more than the actual movie lol
Am I the only person that doesn’t think that this is that bad
The child kidnapping joke was funny 😂
VHS? You mean dvd, or blu ray?
I’m always asking for constructive criticism
One Pikachu looks spot on, Two Ryan Reynolds, Three the Movie actually looks good!
To those who say Jim Carrey is gonna save the movie. I don't think he's gonna save the movie, he WAS a good actor before but now he's just not as funny or good
At least Pikachu looks good, does anyone over there actually know how to make a sonic? They epic fail it's worse then the teaser picture. So glad they said they will fix it. Yea also they should have a PC animated character for will Smith to voice over and that would be better you can have him use his powers and make him do anything or look like anything for Aladdin but that might fail but will see to debate.
No tails, just a goofy human as a sidekick!
Jim Carry ripping on Damien Dark from Arrow, is laughable what the heck?
You do realize...if the sonic movie turns out to be good, Nintendo is gonna try to make another live action Mario movie.
Y'all are mad weird. First, you're saying you're offended because they just tried to appeal to kids and if they made it look better, you'd go see it. Now, you're saying that even if they changed Sonic, you won't see it because it's a cliché kid movie. If you weren't going to watch it because of the cliché, what does it matter what Sonic looks like?
Jeff Fowler Reacts To YouTubers React To Sonic The Hedgehog Trailer And Memes; let's go! snap it up!
Sonic Looks like a Human In an Sonic Costume Created by Furries

Came here for rug
I don’t see this but WHY IS EGGMAN SKINNY
I just clicked for FaZe Rug :)
the legs are so weird
Lmaoo i bet Nintendo payed sega to do this because when detective pikachu was first released it wasn’t taken nicely by the public, sega sold out for money 🤔🤔🤔
I JUST REALISED THAT SONIC HAS THE SAME VOICE ACTER AS THE TMNT
I prefer the shadman trailer
0:20 Oh my, brandon didnt eat an asshole today
I think the biggest problem is that he looks like a midget in a fursuit.  It doesn’t even look CGI.
Me : 3:05
0:20 when there's no food in the fridge
13:52 Really? Rotten Tomatoes?!
So sonic is able to stop time yet he gets hit by a dart WTF
Why are Sonic’s rings teleportation devices????
It 2 make em react
I understand the feeling that this look so bad, but my favorite part is 0:19 - 0:23
Lucky faze rug and anthony Padilla and dang matt
And Detective pikachu is good. But please give sonic hope...
Them: its not that bad
Everyone: Do you know who  the fuck is sonic!!

Them again: i dont play sonic or seen him

Everyone and sonic fans:  Destroy them!!!!

Why does it feel like im liking this sonic design more and more by watching or seeing the trailer several times by reactors...
Please do a video for the IT Chapter 2 trailer
WHY ALL OF THEM SOUND LIKE GJANUS  FROM FRIENDS?

I meant the react team.
I have a conspiracy theory that the whole Sonic horror version is a publicity stunt or a very bored troll working there
You do not want to see tails messed up as well😥
Anthony is so woke its funny!!!
Brandon Rogers reaction is a whole mood
I'll be waiting for the memes
I like the schwuletnik one
NO more teeth no more teeth no more teeth!!!
Sorry but i must say this so be free to delete this comment but please don't ban me cause i must say this 
Sonic team needed a kick in the ass and some beating from fans since the first buggy sonic game i loved sonic since i was 3 i played games since 3 and loved sonic games but after the first  buggy game i was like ok everyone makes mistakes but after amm i lost count how many bad games i lost all hope in them
how could you not like jim carrey? have you seen his paintings
I'm here after pewdiepie's review

You should do kids react to cw the flash.
👍🏻
https://www.fanfiction.net/~blackcatchichi
My theory is that this whole thing was just a marketing ploy and sega and paramount have the actual design information  withheld to us (until they stated a redo) so they could bring attention to the movie and bring in people by making it look like they listened to the fans when they already had the design down
Cause this movie or detec pik isnt about looks 
And if you want to compare other movies marvel taught us that the trailers are possibly never what they seem 
Marketing ploy? Actual mess up? Who knows
Fazeeeeee ruggggggggggg❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

0:20 my reaction after seeing sonic's look
Just because it's popular to hate the design, everyone is going apeshit over it. Even over exeggerating just to get supporters of the same thought. Sure it's not that good, but it's not that bad. I'm on the side of the completionist in this one, still excited about the re-design.
Why were none of the jokes in the trailer funny? 😩🔥
0:21.....this guy went absolutely apeshit. He went positively brainless......go foolish On a real, he lost his plot, ON GOD BRUH!! iM DEAD
Thank you
Jeff fowler
For saving the entire universe
Sonic looks like a freaking monkey!! T_T
lol Sonics eyes should be way bigger
ANTHONY PADILLA! smosh anyone?
pikachu is cute and looks like pikachu but sonic...mehh
i am not going to see the movie
And your mad at sonic just wait until mario became a live action movie
it is really bad
come on it is bad
it is bad
Tails wasn’t in the series until the 2nd game

“Sonic doesn’t have teeth” How the fuck do you know that?
People are saying “it’s okay”, “it’s not that bad”, “stop over-reacting guys”...........but CGI artists HAVE to be perfectionists who pay attention to details in order to please the public (especially the fans). It’s partly their JOB. Y’all saying “it’s not that bad” already shows that they made a mistake with the character design. If not, y’all would say “it’s perfect”.

Nearly no one was complaining about Pikachu because they nailed the character design and knew how to make Pikachu realistic while sticking to its original appearance.
my exact reaction after seeing the trailer. 0:21

thank you Brandon Rogers
why make a hedgehog a human instead of an hedgehog lmaoo wtf
People are gonna hate sonic and love jim Carrey the end. Also the writing is so pathetic
Sonic is actually shaped like thing one and thing two in the live action cat in the hat . .
My boy Jirard is precious, have him on more!
Stevieeee
is that... JIRARD!? REALLY MY BABY JIRARD!!
It's a good thing Rian Johnson wasn't the director in charge he would just cry man-baby so thank you Jeff Fowler for listening to the people.
ANYBODY who says “Sonic” doesn’t look that bad from the OG Sonic, must’ve been hit with a football in the head

RIP my childhood
This was my reaction after the lady asked if he has a child in that bag 😂😂😂😂😂🤦🏼‍♀️ 3:29
Yes Faze clan is dead😍😍
I don't get why people get so worked up over his teeth. If they were horse teeth I'd understand.
I am the only one that think the sonic is ok.... but the legs
I’m with Jirard
@11:20 I agree with Anthony 100%. As someone who grew up playing Sonic games, it’s really offensive that they are disregarding the ones who grew up playing Sonic and making him the icon he is today. Also as long as they make Sonic look less nightmareish and keep Shadow, Rouge, Omega, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Silver, and Blaze AWAY FROM THIS...I’ll be fine
I mean no disrespect. But I’m kinda sad that they didn’t even recognise the character Jim Carrey was playing. HELLO? It’s Eggman?!
"Not that bad"...




Boi
React to The Joker trailer next
I kinda have the same reaction about Sonic the Hedgehog's movie look just like the reactors.
Entitled much.
Sonic doesn't look the best, but I think people are over-reacting. Calm down its just a movie..
Id be alright with how it looks tbh
Someone better tranquilize Brandon (0.21)
That Brandon Rogers is sure an over-reactor, ain't she? She's so silly.
People don’t realize how expensive it is to completely change sonic.I’m confused why the sonic team did not survey in the first place. I have allot of respect for them redoing it in my opinion I think a cartoon version would be better. I feel that they made it for all ages considering the choice of music they used Jim Carrey even if I’m wrong the sonic team for the most part has made their content for kids
This new movie is a reboot of Hop in disguise.
React to it part 2
Why youtubers and not gamers? How can some of these guys like the Sonic? Why couldn't Sonic by Sonic the Hedgehog? Why is this Sonic the Human?
if you listen closely you can hear Sammy saying YOU FRICKIN FRIKS!

Why do we have to make everything realistic

I hate it so much

I think they should like make more sonic and we all vote wich one is better problem SOLVED
From the Producers Of The Fast And The Furious??!  oh no this will suck!
 might as well let Michael Bay Direct it couldn't be any worse.
0:20 Me when saw the trailer for the first time 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The new sonic Movie is like shrek 5
No one:
Not a single soul on Earth:
Paramount: Live Action Sonic The Hedgehog movie






Me: 
How did sonic get hit by that dart is the mystery
“How do you make a movie about sonic?”


Dude there’s so much story to sonic...
Honestly how do people actually find this trailer good and dont see the things that are wrong with his design.
I played sonic growing up but damn people it's just a movie get a life
I really like the sonic movie trailer I don't know why people hate this?
0:20 every sonic fans reaction.
Brandon Rogers is us.
I more excited for Detective Pikachu
Oh matt is here!!
Hell yaw
Yeah, this is disregard of source media. I'm not even thrilled with the Sonic Boom redesign.
Still better than scarfed sonic
I prefer the eyes over a cyclops with 2 pupils
Am going to get hate but I actually enjoyed the trailer
I relate to brandon rogers so much in this video
6:56 wtf was that man? do you even know what ayahuasca is? these people don't know how to sound smart anymore
Who’s here because of rug
Sonic didn’t look at all like a blue hedgehog . Even if they change it what is the point of this live action version of sonic .
Oohohohoho...
This definitely looks like a kids movie. I get Spykids vibes from the trailer 😭 And ikr, where's Tails at?? And the rest of the gang??? Paramount...take notes from Detective Pikachu!! 😖😤🙄😒😭 P.s. Joey Graceffa yayyy 💕💕💕
Wait until On Rotten Tomatoes say about this!
2:11 WTF ISTHAT VOICE
I’m not into it because the plot/humor doesn’t particularly interest me (right now anyway)...
Honestly fix the eyes and maybe tweak the mouth with a budget... but please... fix the eyes
It’s like they hired a CGI artist and they were like
“You do know what sonic looks like”
Artist ”who’s sonic?”
THE EYES ARE BIG AND TOGETHER JUST FIX IT
The Sonic in this trailer looks like a human in a cheap costum
Omg Will Smith’s genie looks terrible

Sonic: hold my beer
Pretty sure half of this people didn’t even knew who sonic was
Yo me & my husband were talking mad shit when we saw the trailer until Jim Carrey came out I WAS LIKE OMG WE HAVE TO WATCH IT!!
Of course Rug is like “iT’s NoT tHaT bAd”
This is the same thing that happened with The Last Airbender. Going from animation to live action is hard. I realised that, so I gave M. Night some slack. Long story short if the live action somehow "ruins" the animation for you then that's your problem. It's like rule 34 but another number; all animation will be made into live action, get used to it.
I have been a Pokemon fan since Red and Blue and I have been a Sonic since before then and that shit looked so bad..... So bad.
SANIC!!!
0:20 i got culture shock
Beta Male spotted.

I hope Brandon does a video about the movie
1:03 that part right there....
0:19 When my uncle comes in my room and locks the door
Sonic died in endgame just because how bad his design looks
Who cares about the movie, all you need to know is that Jim Carry WILL over act... That's all you need to know.
SEGA's "Green" must really been going down "Hill"
Brandons reactions are priceless.
I'm an animator myself and from a production stand point, We are told to make at minimal 10-15 different verification and changes when making concept design for a character. But with game movies most of the concept work is already done when trying to make an alterations say from game to movie. 

The thing is I thing saga or whoever in charge of this (probs Jeff Fowler) may of got just the blacked out concept (stage 1 concepting) or just started from scratch when making the concept without realizing the work had already been done for them 20 years ago, and even as current as 'sonic boom' and/or 'Wreck it Ralph'.
Best character is minivan kid 1
Looks like sonic did amphetamine for a good 5 years
Why people are stupid?
I mean I don’t care what he looks like I’m not seeing it
I hate these new irl characters😭😂
"Why does everything need to be live action? why couldn't the keEP IT A FUCKING CARTOO- sorry I'm getting too heated."
Don't stop now, you're saying what we all thinking XD
2:17 tHaT Is NOt soNic....
I feel like the problem is that they chose a franchise that has already been well developed and has a fan base that has deep nostalgia in it, and tried to take creative liberty over consulting the fan base. Which is not the 10 year olds. It's the 20-40s who grew up with it. It is somewhat disrespectful to not only the fans, but also the franchise itself to not make the attempt as faithful as it can be to it's source material. It's not like I can't understand making a movie "your own", but the consequences should've been obvious.
I do think everyone was way too overdramatic but I am also excited to see how they redesign him

Wait 0:20 j-just wait
The movie itself looks interesting so it seems that people are over reacting. The design is creepy though.

“I’m not trying to be mean but you should lose your job” lol too legit
Paramount: This is for kids.

Us: Gangster's Paradise huh? Child Abduction huh?
Brandon’s reaction made me laugh so hard; I cried. :’)
Wait you react to this but not the joker trailer wtf
Everyone: Comments on it

Brandon Rogers: Has a mental breakdown the second he sees what it is
Sonic does not look bad and if you comment he’s looks bad you get reported
"I'm not meaning to be mean but come on you gotta lose your job"
STOP DEFENDING THE SONIC DESIGN BEARDED MAN
5:53 Live action doesn’t mean it has to make me barf

Coming from a sonic fan unless Nintendo gets ownership of sonic, sonic might die
Shut the fuck up red shirt guy.

Just shut the fuck up.
0:19 Brandon said what we were all thinking...
Whoever thinks he doesn’t look that bad either has never seen Sonic or is blind
3:20 Wait,wheres Tails?!! 

I already love this guy lmao
SEGA: You guys ever played Sonic?

Paramount: Uhhhhh M E O W?
Hi
Should’ve put thesammysonic rant for them too
yay anothny padilal
Why do most of these people sound like fenemists?
Everybody here and the reactors don't see is that sonic is a busts but Jim Carrey as Robotnik is what is going to save the movie. At the end of the trailer is that most important scene of the movie.

Plus why is Sonic based on Earth and not on the planet Mobius? Either sonic is an alien or a government experiment gone wrong.
What is with not featuring one of the best content creators on the platform. For you who do not know, I am talking of course about Dayron Arias
I’m glad that people have voiced their negative opinions on the Sonic design. While the rest of the movie looks good, it’s never a bad thing to voice helpful criticisms of a movie. If we as movie watchers just always settled for “well I guess that’s good enough, or, well it does not look too bad” then we’re never going to get anything better. Movie producers won’t make better quality movies if they think that don’t have to. As a movie watcher, you can always tell a movie director/ producer the things you liked about a film, while also telling them things that they could improve on or change. That way, they know what the good parts of their movies were, and what things they need to work on or improve to make their movies even better quality.
Somebody create a petition to use Pewdiepie's sonic
1:15 noooo!!!! Sonic is already creppy enough
Every Youtuber: Oh my god that’s Sonic!
Brandon Rogers: oH NOoOOOOODJYDIDJD
things that are wrong with the design: THE HANDS, THE LEGS, THE EYES, THE SHOES, THE TEETH, THE BODY PROPORTIONS....THE EVERYTHING.
Sonic has a tail better eyes and not FUCKING human teeth
Who came here for FaZe rug
I heavily disagree with Jirard here. It was a good thing that Nintendo required quality for their movie, since it gave us a good design of Pikachu that fit well within the movie. Since the Sonic movie producers were allowed free range on character design, they did not just try out a cool different design for the character, they just took that opportunity to be lazy. I’d rather have a quality looking Sonic design (even if the design is not original) than something that makes my eyes bleed. Don’t get me wrong, the rest of the movie looks good, but if I’m going to be looking at a certain character for a majority of the film, it shouldn’t be too much to ask that that character’s design doesn’t make my eyes hurt to look at.
Anthony yesssss
man i love brandon rogers ;D
I just think that this should have been a animation and not a cartoon or a live action. Make it look like the game. And when did SONIC GET DOCTOR STRANGE'S POWERS.
At 1:04 I totally agree wtf do we need live action movies of animated characters they are better animated don’t change it . It just makes it worse smh 🤦‍♂️ anyone agree like this comment and reply your opinion thank you
REACT TO BTOB PLZ!
He looks like a child in a costume
Anthony Padilla go back to smosh
Brandon is always so fucking funny
faze rug ruins the video, i dont wanna hear it.
Another thing I hope they change is making him a deeper blue.
Yeah, the redesign will be great, especially  for the designer who will definitely NOT be overworked worse than if they were mules...
No shad sonic, I’m disappointed 😔
Sonic looks like he's from Whoville
jιм carrey ιѕ тнe only reaѕon wнy ιll ѕee тнe мovιe
Okay, so I actually didn't care for this at all. I'm not really a Sonic fan, but I know a bit about it and have seen a few gameplays of some of the games. My sister's boyfriend and his friend argued about this one day, and I just kind of thought until now that it wasn't really worth the hype. I didn't like the look, but I didn't mind it. Now that I've actually watched the trailer for myself, I actually really do hate this with a burning passion, and not so much because of the stupid design (I'm sorry to whoever designed it but that face haunts my dreams and gives me the creeps, so I know there would probably be some kids crying at night because of it), but because it's not really about Sonic. It's about some random human's boring life being interrupted by this, and Sonic is basically the comedic sidekick. You could literally replace him with any supernatural entity or anything extraordinary, and you wouldn't bat an eye because it's not centered around him, so he's easily replaceable by literally anything else. You could fucking replace him with Edward Cullen or Tinker Bell or Wanda and Cosmo and it'd be no different. That's what bugs me.
CoryxKenshin:Not even Sonic It's PONIC....... Sonic's Crack Head Cousin!
Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Their changing sonic's design
what the fuck happened to anthony padilla.
0:20 that boy really is hurt about this

Anthony looks like a Mexican maxmofoe now lol
0:21 is my life
I can say one thing: 
At least it wasn’t sonic boom sonic
1:55 I hate  what he says and the girl too in 2:02
0:23 should become a meme
Honestly it looks bad, but Jim Carrey caried the trailer and I would just watch his scenes
0:20 Jesus it’s just a movie😂🤣
STEVIE! STEVIE! STEVIE! STEVIE! STEVIE!
I feel like fangirls are regretting to pretend their with Sonic now because of this movie








But they kinda may come back with the edit in the movie...well flip-
this Sanic looks like it was designed by Dr. Seuss
The production company can do what they want, but if the main character looks terrifying, I may watch the movie once, but it is not rewatchable. I won’t care for the sequels or the brand, so the audiences’ opinion matters.
Ladies and gentlemen! Chill it could be way worse. See dragon ball evolution.
“It literally looks like a furry costume” 5:23
ON A SUNDAY RIDING MY BIKE
I NOTICE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT LOOK ALIKE

Except Sonic and Paronic.
They need to just cancel the movie. Like seriously. Cancel it and redo the damn sonic design.

He’s honestly not that bad...
Nintendo beats Sega once again XD
Anthony come backkkkkkkk,
I’m just pissed they made him like a human his teeth and his hands are supposed to be gloves but nope they put fur WHAT THE FUCK also his eyes are off he’s so creepy that’s not the sonic I knew looked
LMAO BRANDON ROGERS
0:13 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I WAS GONNA SAY THAT
Oh shoot! You got Jirard to watch this! Yay! I love his livestreams and videos! :)
Pikachu was a good live action design that still looked like Pikachu, Sonic was inbred and mutated, dipped in a septic tank, then slapped by Coolio.
Me when I have to get up for school: 0:20
Brandon started snappin 😂🤣
0:20 when you bust a nut but it zooms into the guys face
im sorry if you create something new I agree its fine if it looks shitty if its your style, but when you take something that's already made I feel like you need to do it justice to the creator
I’m guessing this movies plot will primarily be about the humans boring life problems and Sonic will just be a comedic sidekick. It’ll just be another smurfs/chipmunks/woods woodpecker etc.
I feel Brandon's pain lol
Why DO we need live action EVERYTHING?! THANK YOU!
Even if Sonic looked good the movie would still suck.  The reason why people like the Detective Pikachu trailer is because it’s set in a world that resembles the Pokémon universe and doesn’t just have one or two characters from the source material.
And thus, the nostalgia train dies.
sees Anthony padilla
Oh I guess he’s pretty cool
sees brandon
OKAY NOW THIS IS GREAT!
People too distracted by the design of sonic to realize that the movie involves the military and takes place in the real world instead of just being fully a cartoon
8:10: I love democracy.
how do some of them think that sonic doesnt look like complete shit
React to Cuco Hyrdocodone
3:44 Yeah ya see you think that until you find out he's anti-vax
that thing gas traumatized me.
I'm literally Brendon Rodgers
Brandon rogers is my reaction
He gone Jim carry that movie
You know you fucked up when the creator of said character thinks you fucked up and hates it
We Don't Need A Sonic Movie? THAT IS THE $hit NEED TO SEE 
But The Design Looks Like $hit That's All 
Why Are These Guys 0verreacting They Look Like They Are About To Cry Jeez
0:20 Jesus... this mans reaction... Now I'm scared to see this monstrosity unfold...

Imagine them screwing up a Shadow the Hedgehog movie too.

Meanwhile, Shadow fans in the corner:

“Damn, not here!”
The Original Sonic the Hedgehog never had Tails until Part 2 for you newbies and dumb fucks. So stop asking about Tails.
I hate drama that just happens right now with the movie like pls don’t let that a big deal now the people that make the movie need to work even more and spend money is not easy at all you know I’m fine with his look yes he looks little weird but not that but he actually look little cute that is my opinion
I'm here for Jirard 🕶️
i agree with the guy that said 'why do we keep making live actions out of things, just leave it be a s a frickin cartoon'' xD hahaha
It is that Bad, fuck that Movie
Dang Matt Smith my other BOIIIIIIIII
Faze rug my BOIIIIIIII
I love that Brandon Rodgers and DangMattSmith are in this
We all knew they r going to mess it up but we all wanted to see how bad
Jim Carrey? No thanks. Freaky Sonic? Double no thanks.
A total abomination
whats the wrong with the sonic trailer? is it just me who's doesnt seem care in the trailer or doesnt seem bad lmao
5:21 nail on head description
I know there was SOMEONE on at the movie's team who is trying to tell them that Sonic looked whack and I am happy that person feels vindicated right now.
sonic looks like a the cat in the hat
College kids and adults react to Tame Impala and Mac Demarco. PLEASE!!!
Anthony Padilla looks like John Snow from Game of Thrones on Summer vacation 😂
mario is next
Can you React to the IT chapter 2 trailer?
movie logic he can dodge a bunch of rockets but cant dodge a tranquilliser dart
Please do a react video of former "Teen Mom 2" star Jenelle Evans' husband.
You know what I don't get they all ready have a 3D version of sonic from Wreck-It Ralph so why can't they use that?
We need more Chris Klemens
 on React
What the fuck is wrong with that Brandon guy also they have to fix my fuckin childhood I prefer the cartoon than this shit
My favourite Pokemon was Psyduck
I knew Sonic was going to look bad BUT NOT FUCKING ASSHOLE BAD
I SWEAR NEXT MOVIE THEY WILL TURN LINK INTO A SEX OFFENDER
Brandon Rogers is right I think we should've got Dengeki Bunko Ignition Climax and not a terrible sonic movies
Brandon is me seeing my weeb culture being demolished.. fucking Hollywood
It wouldve been better with knuckles
Brandon shouldve been sonic
Even furies were uncomfortable with the trailer
5:49 that laugh though
where the fuck is sammy ??????????????????
Yep Brandon you said the truth #preach
ANTHONY IS A TRAITOR
And just saying jim carrey must have a painful back carrying the entire movie
rug, you disgust me for supporting this sonic
At least they are going to fix sonic. Doesnt need refilming just need to redo all the after effects. Cant wait to see the new version hopefully iys on par..
Watch the "it chapter two" trailer
If the director was willing to change the look of sonic that fast. Obviously they didnt like it either.
PEOPLE PLS STOP AND GIVE IT A CHANCE -__-!! I love his design, it looks original
Btw. Lmao people can't realize that painting animation and CGI are two different things 😂👏
Brandon Rogers kind of looks like Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury when he's mad (which is a good thing).
damn Brandon's a mood
Kelsey: "Im a sonic fan, but I'm not a huge sonic fan though"
Me: I'm a Kelsey fan. An absolutely huge Kelsey fan."

I'd rather have that eyes because it's much more realistic than a single eyeball with two eyes, that's just plain weird lol! 😂

who r these guys
Awww man, it looks so weird. I'm a bit curious.
nice video
Kelseeeeeeyyyyy
3:06 when your a sonic huge fan and they fk it up
She said it’s for young kids...
AM A YOUNG KID AND IM SWEARING BAD WORDS BECAUSE IF THIS MOVIE TRAILER!!!!!
the girl at 4:37 be trippin
They lowkey got Rug on here?
Plus the sonic design is totally unacceptable & not the sonic I remember. Total disaster
I didn't find it that bad tho. Looks kind of fun for the kids.
Im sorry what was your name? NOBODY CARES !!!!!😂🤚
I feel like cartoons/ animated movies are slowly going to just become "ancient" in some way

And when we have kids, the animated movies will be as "rare" or "unpresent" as cassettes for the early 2000s kids
0:20 same
Why do you want them to pay so much money to fix it? For a company to open up about design and fix it in around few months. That hate is not good for you and we should appreciate conpanies doing this now
It looks like a child trying to cosplay as Sonic
Jirard"fence-sitter" Khalil. Playing both sides doesnt make you seem more intelligent or contemplative.
0:38 GET BACK IN SMOSH, DAMMIT!
I didn’t think it was god awful. Not great but it could have been better.
I don't give a damn about what anyone says. Sonic's design looks great, the Sonic Movie Trailer is great, and the Sonic Movie is GOING to be great!
I work at a theatre and we've had the standee for sonic for a while. Way before the trailer came out. And going strictly off of the standee I knew sonic would look fucking terrifying. As soon as I saw the standee and saw Sonics legs I knew it was going to be bad. It looks too human. Me and my coworkers have been saying it was too humanized. The trailer just confirmed it for us. I'm not the biggest sonic fan. I played it a bit as a kid and that's it. But even I was confused and upset and livid. They did sonic dirty. This is not an overreaction.
My first thought was OOOOO, then I saw the Sonic Design....😒😒😒😒😒😒. That was a very cruel joke.
After think about it, I realized that they did a "Who's" version of SONIC, 'cuz we already have "The Grinch" as EddMan
Brandom Rogers is literally my reaction when I saw and knew about this movie 😂😂
Faze rug
0:20 when it’s Monday
2:00 it’s rug
i believe the design was just an experiment and already had a backup sonic
Joey: oh no no no this is not sonic

Me: laughs about how polite joey is trying to be

Joey later: the one on the left looks like a furry costume

Me: oh no no no this is not Joey
I think will wait until it’s.......Straight to VHS yea that took me out💀😂
I thought I saw Catherine paiz
2:43 “I don’t remember anyone asking for this”... Yea no one asked for a Dora The Explorer movie either
"It's not that bad" someone needs to die
I didn't noticed Kelsey was in this.....😲😲😋
Yeah, they need Tails in it also. I just don't think they really planned any of this movie out that well.
It was great seeing stevie here

The Sonic fandom reaction summed up
They need to keep in mind (the creators) SONIC. IS. A. HEDGEHOG. NOT. A. LITTLE. KID.!!
Elders react to ninja sex party

Make it happen people.
Hopefully they fix Sonic then make it a trilogy bring on Tails, Knuckles and Shadow!!! 😍
Hope they remake sonic well
I mean I’m hyped like idk, I mean I don’t have a single shit at the movie, like what if they “even” messed up I don’t care I’m just hyped for the movie and not only Jim Carrey ( but of course I’m hyped for him playing dr. Egg man)
Real reason pikachu is better than Sonic
Ryan renalds > Jim Carey 
Justice Smith > Jim masden
Real adult comedy with a kid friendly vibe>
Jim Carey's hardest attempt to put all the weight of the movie on his back for it to succeed
sonic is a deformed rat and not a hedgehog. the fans could make him better that's how bad it is.
I am not 100 precent sure that this movie will be bad... but I do not understand why they couldn't have made an animated movie instead...
And they brought 2 fggts.. I bet there is also one trans here just so that ppl dont get mad
It's the different between anime and cartoon
Anime >>>>>>>>>>>> Cartoon
0:44 me when I see a new movie coming out
Ohh no, not today
Yeah it’s bad but everybody is making it 10 times worse
0:23 thats me seeing sonic
Oml it’s rug ! I remember doing a drawing YEARSS with him and banks 😂💀 way before the faze New York house days 💀
But to be honest endgame was way worse than sonic
2:13 he is 👬
3:50 is my whole ass mood
Sonic can avoid 1000+ missiles




But can't avoid a tranquilizer...
A Sonic The Hedgehog movie is inherently about playing to your nostalgia. There aren't going to be tons of kids who have no idea who Sonic is, begging their parents to take them to see this movie. If it's for people who already like Sonic, then........ you should make damn sure it actually looks like Sonic, right???
I cant stand the two with the high pitch squealy voices
Omg they should react to  QPark lol
I feel bad for Paramount just leave them alone they tried
2:37 - "How do you make a movie about Sonic?"


Not like this.
Next big chungus the movie
I honestly don’t get what’s wrong with this because it looks great and I’m hyped for it
Yup tails wud be tere
this our childhood
1:08 I agree so muchhhhhh
Why do you think the Pikachu Live Action is better

It's Deadpool inside of a Pikachu.. How can you hate it?
How the hell SEGA even allowed that horror
Mama pls don’t you cry Im sorry 




Do the next part if you know what song this is
Can I get a like every time they say F*ck?
2:12 I thought he was going to say 'oh no.. poor thing' 😂😂 but he did that 'oh no no'  just to say 'that is not Sonic' 😂😂
OMG ROGERS IS ON THIS ONE WHERE IS OUR LASTEST UPLOAD FROM HIS CHANNEL???
I hate all of you I hate you all so much. "YouTubers" are worthless pieces of shit that drain society.
Right after I nut and forget to pull out: 0:19
i hate this live action trend that disney started
Didn't he die in endgame tho
Why light powder sky blue instead of Sonic blue?
Why human proportions instead of Sonic’s actual proportions?
Why do the “non hairy” parts have tan/grey/white hair instead of skin like every other Sonic?
Why screw up the eyes so badly and have this instead of Sonic’s iconic eyes?

I want to meet the person who actually made these “artistic decisions”. I don’t care what happens, I’m not going to watch this movie, whether it’s bad or good, I just want to ask WHY they decided on those...

"How could you not love Jim Carrey?"

Guy's an absolute nut. Heck, he's anti vaccination, following Gwyneth Paltrow around like a puppy. He raves against his own movies because they're "too violent". He went off the deep end long ago and I can't believe people still act like he's such a great person.
when people say this is not that bad.. I immediately wanna slap that person
Sonic's teeth were always human teeth
Sonic is not for the younger audience you idiots, they don't care about Sonic, hell, they make fun of t every chance they get, get outta here with that stupidity.
Why does anyone think that a redesign of the character will somehow help curb the obvious trainwreck of a directorial job?  Even if Sonic looked perfect, the trailer shows this'll be just another generic, boring, poorly-done movie.
the design is fine
REACT TO AFL!!!!!!
4:58 - "I don't know if it would work."

It could - if they went the Space Jam route and made it live-action animated. Do studios not have that kind of innovation anymore? There are other ways.
I don’t get it. If everyone hates live action cartoons so much, why do we keep getting more of them??
You can tell they all saw it stopp lieing
Yeah that sonic look is Gag worthy. it's like Friday Friday all over again, The terrible song whatever thing we all hated. 



THAT'S what this sonic is like to us..
I just came her for FaZe Rug
0:20 GUYS NEW MEME FORMAT
I bet there're showing of they're CGI, you didn't have to make a live action Sonic jezz, the teeth at least make a sharp one or no teeth
faze rug!!

What what FAZE RUG! BRIAN OMG IM SHOCKED THAT U ARE IN THIS VIDEO  😱🔥.  #fazeup
Why is That guy wearing a dog leash?
“Furry costume”
3:06 Brandon Rogers is an absolutely great representation of me when I saw this trailer.
I’m with Stevie, I didn’t really notice the teeth when I first watched the trailer. My problem is the human like limbs, they make him look lanky and weird.
The design kinda grew on me, but then again i'm a 14 year old kid who thought transformers the last knight would be decent so who am i to judge.
Why is his arms blue
Why is this guy in the red so quick to defend a sub par work. Why is it that no one ever just does a bad job anymore.

Dont worry people  sonic will get a rework him
WhY is he wearing nikes?

These reactions
Are funny as hell

Where is the white stripe on his shoe? I'm not even asking for a buckle. Come on Paramount and Sega. #GetThatShitRight #GTSR
Detective pikachu looks better
Brandon Rogers just created a new meme format 👩‍🔬
Why that song of all songs?
Can we stop using the "It's for kids" excuse for when a movie looks/is bad.
as much as i love Jim Carrey, he is just play as Jim Carrey, not Eggman.

It's a shame the director of Ghostbusters 2016 didn't listen to the fans.
They could have done way better with sonic
Personally I like that the studio listened to criticism, creators should be allowed to create sure but sonic the character is not a new idea, they have that leeway in the script and other casting choices. This design is as ludicrous as them just turning him purple and being like sonic is purple now we decided. It 100 % looks like a ten year old boy in a furry suit.
The only thing that wasn't fine was Sonic's proportion... Colours are fine... His teeth? Come on sonic never had problems with his teeth as if there was a hole or smth... His sneakers were realised more realistic... Also eyes? Perhaps they should have been more unified like in Sonic X tv series.... but those eyes aren't so bad afterall
I would like to FBE react to DC joker trailer
I don't demand anyone to change that but as a creator.... I think you should do it that you don't regret it later.
Cause when you fail while you're thinking that you think that's best you can do you can move on but when you fail because someone ask... you will just going to be like "oh,I shouldn't do that"
Imagine if the Marvel movies handled the design of their characters I.E. Avengers, Guardians, Thanos Etc. as half ass as the Sonic design. Do you think those movies would have made it to the first Avengers movie? Nope.
If this is appealing to children would this movie be rated PG-13?
jim carrey is a good choice for Eggman
Sonic bish what tought it was sanic
0:22 when I forget to bring my homework
How was Sonic hit by a dart but dodged missiles and shit?!

Joey: ooh no oh no no no 😂😂😂😂
If you wanna make a creative movie with your own designs, make something from scratch. If you are gonna base your movie off of a well known video game franchise with and decide, ‘I’m going to get real creative with how my main characters is gonna look’ it’s gonna be HATED. Please stop trying to change what’s already a good thing. Just stop!
I agree with Brandon Rodgers all the way
I mean, come on, Sonic looked terrible. You don't think so? Well sorry, but even the original Sonic creators criticized how bad he looked. 
When the creators of Sonic even criticize how bad he looked....... then yeah, he looked pretty bad.
BEARDMAN! So glad Jirard is here! Now just need to get Projared, PBG and Chuggaaconroy
0:19 When you just lay down and your alarm clock goes off
He literally looks like a knock off version of Sonic. He's Sawnik the hedgepig. It literally looks like a child in a Sonic suit

He just looks like a kid in pajamas lmao

Everyone is hating because its the cool thing to do. Sonic didnt look bad. My inner child is excited. I only got to play sonic at my cousins house since they had sega and I only had nintendo. 1991 flashback.

AHAHA but the original sonic was creepy
Imagine what Sonic would look like LIVE 😬
It's just a movie, why all those youtubers complaining too much 🤨😕🤣😂😂😂 ➡️👎
Brandon rogers reaction at the beginning xD
Why is Sonic freakishly tall..
5:25 please fuck off
What's so badd with sonic
I thought it looked good
Do a try not to get mad with this sonic movie
I think sonic looks fine
I can't say it enough, have Danny DeVito voice sonic and it will.be fucking perfect
H E  L O O K S  C O M P L E T E L Y  F I N E
Guys look at hedgehog it's not sonic Anthony talking about this but he voicing the main character
I was excited when I heard about the sonic movie but after watching the trailer not going to watch it in my opinion if this film is already getting so much negativity not worth my time and I’m also going to point out what is the story even about doesn’t make any sense
I really like  the guy with the red shirt's comments
And now the animator will be stuck in OT hell, and might not get paid for it, to redesign and re do the movie, cause the studio isn't gonna change the release date.
Everyone who said they’d see it is wrong.
A lot of these youtubers in these videos ,easily display how disconnected  to the world
PewDiePie Fox the Sonic.
That’s y I like rug everyone says mean shit but him
Some of these arguments made just no sense lol
I get he's not supposed to look like a complete cartoon, which the fans aren't asking, we ask that he keep his original design with a realistic feel to it. For example, some people have been justifying his design because context makes it seem as though he's coming from a different planet, which would still allow him to look the way he has for years now, all that I personally feel needs to be done with Sonic's original desing is just make him look like he already does and give him fur so he doesn't just look like a cartoon.
Its not that bad shut the fuck up
I think Brendan Rogers' reaction speaks for us all.
Brandon at the beginning had me ded for a long ass time with that scream XDDD
"Oh no... oh no no no..." Lmao
if you think about it....what if they did  this all on purpose make sonic look like shit on purpose cause a huggggeeeee stir get everyone talking about it then "redesign" it...like probably not what happened but it is an idea the movie is out in 2 months and thats a very short time to re render AN ENTIRE MOVIE for the main character
We need a live action Danny phantom movie that would make a lot of money think about it, good looking teen in high school with supernatural ghost power. Make it similar to twilight and we got a movie.
Who else clicked on this because of faze rug aka Brian
“I don’t remember anyone asking for this” - a mood for most 2019 movies
0:19 when you drop diamonds in minecraft in lava
2:12 literally me throughout the whole trailer
Thank god they're changing him
I dont understand why some say "its not that bad" when theyre changing it because its that bad
Can't stop laughing at Brandon's reaction. Relatable.
Faze rug is a youtuber? I thought he was a rat that got lost on the internet
If Sonic was the only one who was cartoon in a live action movie then it would be like Who Framed Roger Rabbit? which was a GREAT movie!
“I don’t want to be disappointed today”

the public making them change sonic has nothing to do with the audience having too much power but more that the company decided to make sonic look different and a  lot of people didnt like it. where as with aladdin many people were just unsure of will smith

OMG CHRIS!!
“I rather watch a cartoon with the original animation”
Funny thing is there was an animated Sonic The Hedgehog movie back in 1999 with the classic design and nobody remembers it.
Anthony is so god damn hott
You should have them react to the Aladdin
No one:
Not a single soul:
Paramount: Live action Sonic the Hedgehog
Me: 0:20
I think it's a bad thing if it's for original content, but it's a good thing if that character is so well-known
00:20 my reaction
I speak for all of us when I say, We ALL channeled Brandon looking at this trailer. 😂
Joey: "The one on the left literally looks like a furry costume!"
LMAO
To the point being made about when should a creator create and when should an audience push back, and how it's "dangerous":
If you were talking about a purely creative and original enterprise, sure.  But that's not what this is...this is a blatant money grab from people who have an aging IP and half-assed a product they were sure people were just going to swallow because of nostalgia.  When they were made aware that their target audience was more or less outraged at seeing what they had done, finally realized that money grabs only work when your audience is positively engaged.  Piss off or otherwise alienate them with an inferior product and you're just another "remember back in the day...?" on the scrap heap of pop culture history, rather than re-inventing yourself for a new generation.  I feel like part of the push-back on the design came from the fact that people saw this as just another studio squeezing nostalgia for cash rather than fans of the original IP or any of the iterations thereafter to make a genuine love letter to, or at the very least something that wouldn't tarnish the reputation of, something that helped shaped their childhoods, regardless of generational differences.  


The lack of recognition of nuance in the issue when the "dangerous" label is thrown out is sadly indicative of the surface-only understanding that the social media/instant gratification culture has wrought.  (Hang on, did I just defend social media for doing something right then say it's responsible for turning people into morons?  Yep...nuance.)


Conspiracy theory:  The creative team behind this film ARE fans of the IP, but not of Sonic!  How else can you explain the seemingly painstaking amount of detail in the final Robotnik reveal when they butchered what everyone knows Sonic, to a certain degree, should look like?
Ppl take this sh*t way too serious
You should get people to react to the saveShadowhunters project, one of the biggest movements made by fans for a show and had no results

It was a design flaw, (Head size, arms and legs, fur, no gloves, eyes and teeth are completely off) and the idea of a live action was driven because of other big companies which are doing the same. Most live actions suck in my opinion. I would rather watch those old Looney Tunes movies where the characters were drawn and animated into the IRL scenes. It fits better, looks better, and gives the idea of 2 worlds being merged in one. They could have also used the normal design of Sonic you can see in the current games, but with extra enhancements. It would be 100% better and probably way easier to work with.. Also, going back to fix it might be a second mistake.. We can only hope they won't screw up.

I like sonic but this looks really bad. Jim Carey  why you even doing crappy movies
What if they make a live action Mickey Mouse show
Not a fan of Faze, but I agree with everyone’s opinion.
No za warudo memes...
Who is Jim Carrie?
I don't know who is Jim Carrie......
3:04 is a total Billie Eilish fan
maybe just like Rampage, what do you expect: A monster destroy city
what you get: The Rock Action
Detective Pikachu smiling in the corner
I think Pokémon would inherently be easier to transition than sonic since Pokémon is entirely animalistic.
1:09 amen brother if it's a cartoon leave it a cartoon. Making it live action just destroys it.
What’s name of song 7:40
Jim carry is going to carry this movie
Kids don't know anything about sonic. Or Pokemon.  We adults know about this. It's from our era. Theses movies are for us adults💯!!
Stevie sounds like the big sister who can’t understand her little brother’s tantrum.
Dont sorry the creators of the movie are going to redesign sonic because of people's opinion on it they don't want to make a movie where no one is going to watch because the main character looks stupid.
Fuck everyone Sonic is cool and it's gonna be amazing
Pizza lettuce
🍌🍞
Fire everyone involved in the making of this movie lol
The bad thing about this movie its Sonic's design...If they will fix it..i see no problem...i am a HUGE Sonic fan...since i was very little..i wished to work at Sega and i created characters inspired on the anime Sonic X ...Sonic had a great impact on my life and i will deffinetly support their work on bringing him to life...because honestly...i always wished to see a movie with Sonic and i never imagined that this will happen..
Jesus Anthony what happened to your hair?
Right leave it as a cartoon fr lol
I have a strange feeling that if Sonic Mania hadn't come out and been amazing, people would have been like "Yeah, this seems about right for the Sonic franchise."
Be honest everyone hates it because it's sonic
If there is any change in Sonics design I’m definitely going to see it. Not only is it probably gonna be fun to rash on at its worst but if they go through all that trouble to change it for us I feel the need to support it in some way
Me watching the trailer = 0:19
** See's Trailer **


Me: Ah shit, here we go again
The new Sonic Hedgehog....They call Him Mr "Rat Ba$tard Socialist"....Courtesy of the basement dwellers...YUK!!!!!
Hey Jirard is here!!
I feel sorry for the animators :/
Or how about no movie because Sonic looks bad the storyline looks trash or there probaley better off making animated movie instead I hope we get something better because nothing can beat Detective Pikachus graphics they nailed it spot on
Ayy.....faze rug
0:21 the fuck is this?
Where are the gloves? WHY DOES SONIC HAVE HUMAN EYES 👀? Uh, is that Jim Carrey?
That thing looks nothing  like a "furry costume"
My favorite thing about the Sonic trailer is everybody losing their minds over it 😂
Ugh what’s next, live action Mari-oh no please,no stop, DONT,STOP!
FAZE RUG IN IT 😭😭
I wanna see Alex Wassabi
Faze rug didn't say a single word through out the trailer
This movies going to be so great! The only thing that would make this better is if they put "meh" from the emoji movie here.
They should have kept it to a Roger Rabbit theme or somethin
brandon rangers is my favorite one 😂
Jim Carrey is the best thing about it ♡
cool
rug?
Ughhh I hate this! Oh is that Jim Carrey?!
Anthony!
looks good to me
RUG!!
Id rather watch detective pikachu
I’m excited for the pikachu movie. It looks so good and they made pikachu actually look good
no it's SANIC the Hedgehog
In every live action movie of a game, like the Pokémon movie, you are able to just see the silowet of the  character just by seeing a glimpse of him like if you just take a small look at dective pichkach you can just see a glimpse of the old pichkach but just taking a glimpse of Sonic you don’t see sonic at all
React to the Dora movie
Why is Arin not in this video
Fuck your mum
The Sonic in this trailer looks like a human in a cheap costum
Jirard Khalil get tf outta here
John DiMaggio would be a better a better Robotnik/Eggman. Just saying...
The teeth really aren't that bad.
But when you pair them with those GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKIN' EYES!
He'll look either fuckin' horrifying or the most realistic furry you'll ever see.
YESSSS  DANGMATTSMITH
what about the dora movie..
since they made The movie : Detective Pikachu   , other studios are ALSo starting to make realistic films of certain movies .-.
Detective Pikachu is gonna be more faithful than the Sonic movie
Hey! It's Stevie again.
awe my baby rug
has anyone realized that the movies with Gangsta’s Paradise are shitty... starting with Green Lantern holy god
Where's Tails? In Sonic 2, just like in the games.
Finally Kelsey Impicciche is here!!!
Calm down Rogers, you overreactin' ass mofo.
Sonic the Hedgehog movie is equivalent to the Emoji movie. Perhaps worse. Definitely worse.
Lets be real tho, sonic fans got over run by furries. hence the design of the character in the movie.
Rug what ??
Anthony is actually digging it like wow
Brandon?? Is he good😂 that scream confused me😂😂
01:54 Did Labib get a nose job?
FAZE RUG!!
this vid got me thinking what if other people made more movies off of video games.......like undertale....... XD
Wait...hold up...when did Anthony Padilla become Jon Snow?
Endgame is worth going to the theaters for. This movie, as it is now, doesn't even deserve to be in torrent sites, it seems.
I wish they would make the movie more like the Sonic videogame and had more characters like tails or knuckles and actually MADE THE CHARACTER DESIGN NOT TERRIFYING
yes CHRISSSS
I JUST REALIZED WHAT MATT SMITH WAS WEARING. OMFG.
3 Reasons why detective Pikachu trailer  is amazing:

1. Pikachu looks like a Pokémon
2. All the other Pokémon look like Pokémon 
3. Ryan Reynolds
GOTTA GO FASTTTTTT
Sanic goes faster
Stevie!!
I do want to go see this movie. I am so glad they are redesigning Sonic though!. just make him fit the original!!!
New Movie of the Year 2019.
In only watching it cause of Jim Carrey, but fingers cross that sonic will get fixed
Like I said before... 

Just because you made a live action of Pikachu, DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN MAKE ONE ABOUT SONIC BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS!!!
I’ve always wanted to see Anthony hate on this since the trailer came out😀😀😀😀
Are we gonna ignore that faze rug is in this video
Screw the girls who were saying “ItS nOt ThAT BaD”
Chris  Klemens
 is such a MOOD
The only good part  of the movie  is Jim Carrey
“Wtf is this? Why do we need live action everything, lets leave it as a fucking cartoon. I’m getting too heated” MEE! ME ANYTIME THEY ANNOUNCE A LIVE ACTION MOVIE
Everyone gangsta till Jim Carey shows up as dr robotnick

I personally don't think its that bad
Kelsie impichicche (hope I spelt it right). Oh my gosh. Hi welcome to react YouTubers squad
20 in trending NICE!!!
Movies are made to entertain the public. If the public doesn't like it, the studio needs to reconsider. It's that some.
I’m just wondering why Sonic is a young furry who tapped into the speed force
Jim carrey is gonna have to Carry  this abomination of a movie.....
I think my reaction was way WAY worse than theirs! UUUGGGHHHH sonic doesn't even look like sonic AT ALL!
Live action spongebob....
When will these fricks learn...
They blatantly didn’t make it for sonic fans but it’s so disturbing that it isn’t for kids either so ??? (Do kids these days even know who sonic is?)
Instead of making live action movies they should reboot Animorphs remember the hit book series??
I think us the people should let the artist create the art 🖼 because we don’t know what might become a cult classic
The new live action movies coming in 2019
Lion king, pikachu, dumbo, Dora, Aladdin, and sonic



😩
sonic: can dodge missles and bullets and shit


also sonic

Laur diy: oh I didn’t see this trailer 
Kelsey from the 100 baby challenge:IDK :~]

( the person who kept sonic in the duffel bag looks like Chris Pratt )
@ 1:40 Is she Sloan Harper?
People keep saying that they marketed the movie towards kids, but honestly I feel like the design would scare children more then it would make them want to see the movie
Here's the problem with "humanizing" Sonic's design:
The pokemon games and anime have always had humans and pokemon intermingled. You can see the contrast, the size differences, behavior differences, etc, and pokemon are very obviously a different species. 


But many Sonic games have ALSO had humans mixed in with the colorful animal characters. Sonic may act like a normal person, but he's not supposed to look human or even partially human. He is still a different species, and that's why stretching most of his proportions (but not all of them) into a vaguely human shape just feels wrong.


It also might've helped if they had LITERALLY ANY OTHER SONIC CHARACTER in the trailer! Tails, Knuckles, Amy, hell I'll even take Big the cat at this point.
What is happening sonic movie and picichu movie???? Ummmmm 90s much 😂
Should be called 'washed up youtubers react"
It looks nothing like sonic the hedgehog ur destroying my childhood u pricks I fucking hates it it doesn't even sound like him ether an when do fucking hedgehogs have fur with sonic they should have done it the way they done it with toy story that would have been a better option
“i’m not trying to be mean but LOSE YOUR JOB!” i love brandon so much lmaoooo 💀💀
Live action and cartoons can work together. Space jam got it to work.
I can’t wait to see what the new version looks like... And I they have to pay so much f$@king money to FIX IT 🗣😂😂😂
I can't believe these people hadn't heard all the rumors before the trailer was officially released. i mean we knew about jim carrey for MONTHS
"The one on the left literally looks like a furry costume." I died lmaoo i fuckin' love Joey xD
You should make them play/react to Fortnite

I think the dialogue is horrible!! Sooo no thanks
OMG yassssss JOEY YOU SLAY QUEEN
I only watched this for Chris Klemens
I don't mind the teeth as much as the way his mouth moves
Whoever the bald guy is you should keep him off the internet if he says we are over reacting
4:49 I think we would all agree
I bet that sonic fanboy says:



THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS HAS CONSEQUENCES
20 seconds when  you realize that you have to watch this.
There are two kinds of youtubers
They should also chill out because they didn't create it
And Knuckles*
If Jim Carrey doesn't say pingas, I will be disappointed
"Would you think the film is better with the Sonic on the left?"... YEAH. FUCK YEAH. Is it realistic? No - but we're talking about a blue super-fast hedgehog from an alternative dimension, who gives a shit about realism when you can have stylised believe-ability.
2:37 Thank you Joey!
Why do they get so mad of what he looks
Jim Carry is always funny, but the rest of the trailer is really bad. I’m not going to the theaters to see this. I am going to see Detective Pikachu because the designs looks really cool. Plus,the voice actor for Pikachu is has the voice from Deadpool which makes it funny.
But even tho they fix it HOW CAN WE FORGET 😳
Sonic in the games and cartoons: Nice.

Sonic in the first draft of the movie: ..........but TEETH cue uncanny valley effect
Why does this channel has so many subs
He's an ALIEN! So he may look human.
Why does faze rug look worse than sonic him self
He's not an ACTUAL HEDGEHOG PEOPLE!
Detective Pikachu for the win.
Sonic looks so hideous, I’m glad I’m no longer in love with Sonic anymore
Nooooooo!! There fixing sonic!! I liked Sonic! ;{
It’s not gonna be relatable if they make him more of a hedgehog!
Adults React to The Gazette (J-Rock)!!
They had to make Sonic relatable!! OMG

Oh no no no no that is not sonic

Okay so Sonic’s running speed is 760mph, remember that.

Sonic is also fast enough to flip a semi-truck by rolling into it.

Sonic was hit in the leg by a dart.

Sonic also essentially stopped time when those mussels were fired at him. In a scene that is assuredly going to rip off Quicksilver’s from Days of Future Past.

Actually (directed towards the guy in the blue striped shirt) what you said about molding content for your videos you can do that within one to two days a movie on the other hand takes a couple of years to make so if they gave up power to the viewers It could take 7-8 years to make a movie that is an hour and fifty minutes long
0:20 all of us

I feel like a good Sonic would be like blue rocket raccoon, with humor that's not as violent. And without guns. No more guns for Sonic. Please no!
Faze rug said like 2 words an got like 30 seconds of screen time during the actual trailer
Thank you at least some people don’t think it looks that bad.  people are over exaggerating And I’m  pretty sure people are hating on it because others are, some people need to stop being a followers and start being leader

Sonic Fans: "WHAT THE FRICK!?"
This is not sonic....


"I T S  S A N I C"
Stevie looks fucking tired as hell
Poor Live-action Sonic
What if: They designed Sonic this way on purpose? They knew the Sonic fanbase would explode, and this would garnish a ton of exposure for this movie. And the only time they used this design was for the trailer and teaser-posters? What if the movie is allmost done with the "new" redesign allready? That would be marketing skills.
They need to stop remaking old cartoon characters and leave them alone. Just put old original cartoons on nick and Cartoon Network instead of these new shows and new reboots of shows we’ve watched before when we were little kids
I agree with Brandon and Cris so much✨
mole rat is here aswell
0:38 Anthony from smosh... feel old yet?
This movie looks horrible and should never have been made 🙄. Why? Just why!?
Jim Carrey has s very ace ventura in this movie

There redesigning his look tho

Jirard was the only cultured person in this group 😤
Sonic in the movie looks like a blue version of the little boy in Jumanji when he gets turned into a monkey lol
That old sonic fan Boi was right your fantasy’s can never be quench can they
Best part of the movie will be Jim Carey
Omg Kelsey is in the YouTube reactors, hi! 😄
Why is everything REALISTIC    is that the new movie trend
Uhhh Meow?
Is that my boy jon snow
They just need to change his eyes and his teeth
This Joey person. Literally everyone else talks casually and he forces the sassy diva accent or does he really talk  like that on the regular?
I wouldn’t know what to do if I designed Sonic for this and everyone was roasting me on the Internet 💀💀 just start crying probably..
whose the guy who says
"I can't wait to see what the new version looks like, and i hope they have to pay so much FBEEPin money to fix it"
I just wanna SUB. HIS REACTION WAS GREAT!!🤣🤣🤣
0:19 make this a MEme KNOW
Laura: calm
Brandon: Having a mental breakdown
Yo faze rug is in thisssz
The guy at 0:19 was exactly my reaction when I saw the Sonic trailer XD
Yo faze rug here so its lit
I might be the only one but I hate live action movies with a passion. How many animated need to be destroyed before we get that it just doesn't work.... As if Dragonball and Avatar weren't enough of a trainwreck?!
Tell the reacters to react to this
The long brown hair dude is  holding the biggest grudge they said that they would fix it hello numb skull did he see the #gottafixfast rant over who else wants to see the movie Sonic looks like with the redesign

Brandon is the actual, physical representation of the entire sonic community when they saw that trailer
Honestly, loved the trailer all around, i feel people are giving it way too much negativity
Faze Rug I feel like sonic like ...like...like...like
0:20 when you lose in Mario cart
Jesus...

sonic looks like a sex offender dressed up in a furry costume
The guy being considerate towards the company is me in this situation. All the time and money put in this was sad and dissapointing. Hopefully this did become a way for the company to try to communicate with the fans before they begin putting things into process.
everyone's talking about the teeth but how about the nose?

Why are they hating on it so much?
I’m watching The Lion King The secret life of pets and Detective Pikachu im not watching sonic not worth it
lol brandon when he found out it was the sonic trailer 🤣😂😂
Kelsey is on here yaaaayyyyy!!
8:33 he’s kinda stupid

Very stupid.....
I wonder if this is like the genie in the Aladdin trailers and people are complaining before its 100% done?
The difference between the Sonic movie and the Pikachu movie is that in the Pikachu movie they showed not only pikachu but plenty of other pokemon where as the Sonic movie gave us this horrid rendition of Sonic and Dr. Robotnik instead of Sonic, Tails, Amy, Shadow, and Dr. Robotnik. Everything that the pikachu movie gave us in just the trailer was spectacular where the Sonic movie gave us sub par character design and the only saving grace with Jim Carey as Dr. Robotnik. I don't think that even with the re-design of Sonic it'll be worth watching with only just those two characters and some nobody side characters (and by nobody I mean that they don't coincide with the already established characters in Sonic)
I’m not used to his eyes not being together they are separated:(
I’m so tired of everything being fucking “live action” Sonic is CGI, the new lion king is CGI Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna watch this movie just for jim Carrey
Why does sonic look like Morton hears a who
Brandon is being real tbh
brandons rxn is literally me, period.
The trailer is good but sonic🥴
Lmao 😂. The ay uh people who are attracted to men 👨🏽 made me laugh 😆 so many times with there reactions😂.
YES KELSEY! OUR QUEEN 👑👑
It’s the shoes and the the eyes that horrify me
Paramount : Alright guys we’re making a Sonic movie we need to make sonic 
Animators: Cool whats our deadline
Paramount :TOMORROW
The Sonic can dodge a bunch of middles but can’t dodge a single tranquilizer dart
YAS CHRIS
This isn’t the design and animation teams fault, I’m pretty sure they tried to stop their boss but he probably didn’t listen it happens all to often so guys please don’t blame the design and animation team.
Brandon Rogers was fuckin hilarious
the trailer didn't look that bad it's just that sonic looks like sh*t
I am not seeing this movie unless they fix the eyes. I hate how Sonic’s eyes look.
It’s amazing how videos like this show how dumb Rug really is 💀 everyone else sounded so intelligent compared to him 😂😂
Brandon's really getting a mental breakdown..
BRANDON ROGERS, YES
I dont  have a job
Anthony low key looks like Jon Snow
Dangmattsmith: the 10 year olds can't watch this

The only reason I gave it a like
Where are all the top rated comments? I was really hyped for some funny comments ):
1:06 He's Fucking Right!
Everything Brandon said made me laugh. And he speaks the truth. Also...

Teacher: You have an assignment due tomorrow. It's ten pages long.

Me: 
A reason for the big hate towards the Sonic movie compared to the Detective Pikachu is attention to detail. DP creates a world where pokemon are everywhere, but Sonic makes a world where there’s only Sonic. Dr. Robotnik isn’t even recognizable until the end scene. 
Some people claim that if you got Sonic’s regular design and put it in the real world it would look strange. And that may be true. But the creators of the film need to take some time to look at what Sonic has already been through, and take time to experiment. Pike look at Sonic X and Sonic ‘06 and see how that looks and how you could make it work in real life without making him look like a man in a fursuit
7:48 Faze Rug
Anyone else think they should react to “Devils work”?
Teacher: You have an exam today

I fucking love the concept of sonic. Just with some new eyes and I would love to see it

Why are people only talking about the teeth? Look at the eyes! Sonic is supposed to only have 1 eye ball with two pupils on it, his torso needs to be more round, hands and feet bigger with gloves, sonic looks way to human here. 🤦‍♂️
WAIT WHERE IS TAILS!!??
WHY IS HE WEARING MELTED DENTURES
The memes are better than the movie.
"Why do we need liveaction everything. Let's leave it a f*cking cartoon"
TRUUUE!
The special effects and the lightning and stuff look fantastic,it’s the Sonic design that’s the major cry for help
I'm here just to give some love to Jirard The Completionist

0:38 why does anthony always have shit taste
The Fanbase is going to cause WWIII
the should do what roger rabbit did. they kept the ficitional characaters cartoonish and the actors real and live action. it would look better
unpopular opinion: the movie itself actually looks pretty good, just the design of sonic messed up the whole thing.
They are re designing him.
Bring pewdiepie to react to this
Wait, FaZe Rug?
i wound t be surprised if paramount don't go even when this comes out
Chris is dope.
I think when a creator is creating something original, then the audience doesn’t get to say that it should be changed, as it’s a completely new and creative idea. But if your recreating something for the audience, the audience DOES get a say.
I made a sonic video just now lol
Me when i wake up on mondays: 0:21
How is this Chanel still a thing
the guy in blue shirt is over reacting too much

Hey, I know you guys have done some Anime vids before. I just got into the show but I think it would be cool if you did a React to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
0:20 Are you okay Brandon?  I know people are upsad with the new sonic. But i never seen someone so upsad before by this.
I will predict that those people who are excited to watch this will complain and start to bash the movie lmfao.
Why sonic look like dat..
“Why do we need to make live action everything?”

Dude is preaching to the choir. 💁🏻‍♀️
There’s no saving this POS. I say this as a life-long Sonic fan. I even tried to defend Sonic ‘06 back in the day. Fucking Paramount. Jim Carrey’s gonna be the only good part of that movie.
AHAHAHAHA Brandon's first reaction omygod
People who don’t really Sonic: it’s not tHaT bAD
I cant wait until they actually fuck it up more
Am i the only one who don't gives a fuck about how sonic looks?
Man they made sonic soft as hell , sonic got a attitude to em.

its bad enough I rather see Dora than sonic
Brandon is such a mood. He speaks the truth.
Nintendo vs Sega

How do you not get Egoraptor for the Sonic react.
youtubers/teens/adults/kids (idk which) react to "dora and the lost city of gold" trailer? Anyone?
And while you guys are upset about his eyes and teeth, I"m going to be in the back be so mad that Sonic doesn't have his gloves.
Spiderman: I don't feel so good



Me: 
I’m not trying to be mean, but come on you need to lose your job. LMFAO
gotta get tortured
Honestly I think Sonic looks better when his eyebrows are furrowed. 

They should've gave him a scowl like in the games.
It says something when Nintendo and  Disney have a better grasp of Sonic's character than SEGA and Paramount
who else was screaming "dora" when they talked about how the movies were bad?
Adults react to nirvana pls
Okay, everyone's happy now that it's going to be re-designed but we need to appreciate every single animator that is going to work even harder to do everything all over again

Sometimes you just work for someone and can't give your opinion about something, and, you just gotta do what they tell you...

No more Teeth! No more Teeth!
If Sonic Mania has taught us anything, it's that when it comes to Sonic, the audience should absolutely be the creator
3:03 no, you really wouldn’t.  Trust me.  The Japanese already tried and failed.
who some times think to them self.....who the fuck are some of these youtubers?!
I honestly hope this movie does well, i want the franchise to make it to wear sonic acheives his golden form #24k
If the redone version is better than maybe likely will see the pikachu movie
I feel a spiritual connection with all of Brandon's reactions in this XD.
Nice

Hi Jirad
2:23 is my mood lol
Faze rug?
Fuck yeah! WHERE IS TAILS?
Jon snow lookin ass
I dont really care about the design along as the dialogue is fine, so many people went into trying to make sonic atleast they tried and they are fixing it because they understand the fans but sometimes it's not their choice but someone higher up.

Pokemon trainer BLUE sent out Blue Mickey mouse that claims to be Sonic... The opponent's pokemon fainted. PKMN Trainer Blue won the battle, but are you happy with yourself?
It's sad seeing LaurDiy without Alex
I love Girard, but here he's too much on the fence. There's artistic freedom, and there "insulting the source material and decades of fans". I'm not even a nostalgia fan, never owned a Sega. But like Mario and Pikachu, I have a very clear definition of how Sonic looks. The way this movie was headed was the same as the 90s Mario Brothers movie. Imagine how the Yoshi and Goomba live-actions looked , and ask yourself if any stylistic choice in that movie would've been accepted today by Mario fans.
Brandon Rogers is my spirit animal
But they shouuld honestly move up the movie release date, just imagine the plight of the animators, producers and cgi artists
Faze Rug is the best
Starting to think that they made Sonic like this only for the trailer...So that the audience will appreciate the redesign which was already properly designed...Reverse Psychology maybe? btw The Completionist guy got some good points tbh
Yes Faze Rug

Why the fuck is faze rug there
Where’s amy
No the issue between the genie vs. Sonic is that sonic all you have to do is change the sonic model the genie you have to recast redo the lines then the cgi around him and redo the scene entirely lol Disney had the money to do that but it takes a lit more time and resources to change the genie then sonic
theres just too much people who really just care, it doesnt matter what it looks like, people who complain are memes
React to sidhu moosewala
They already messed up by using gangsters paradise. Why? When shouldna creator create? When the creation is his own original idea and not a popular 90's video game character. The audience is the one they think are gonna pay to watch their movie so the end of the day, the audiences opinion > artistic choice.
sonic looks like a shitty mikey mouse
The ones who did the detective pikachu movie had to do more than the sonic movie but they still fucked up sonic so bad. No excuse
3:05 this one got me hahah
Same boi
1:08 me, him and most people agree on this statement. Like come on, we don't need a "realistic" everything, like have you seen realistic homer simpson, realistic spongebob or many of the other characters that's had realistic memes of them? they look hands down scary af and is not something i'd ever want to lay my hands on.


This movie looks trash, this movie will be trash, I will never watch this movie, not even for the memes sake.
I would rather play sonic 6 then watch this movie with the human sonic
Bruh hes already getting a new design
Btw, I bet they won't fix it, but instead they'll mess Sonic up even more on purpose, to troll the audience. Remember my words xD.
I want Knuckles, Shadow and Tails
I agree with the guy in the red shirt.
I just like the fact that the internet is so powerful that they're making them change the whole main character, makes me think what else could we change coming up...
I like how some people probably didn't give a shit about sonic before this film and now through memes and whatnot, pretentiously joins in on the hate.
OMG DANGMATTSMITH
I hate the model and it changes threw the trailer it looks horrid like bad 80's furry fur suit bad  ^~`.`+^
You should do another how long can you watch challenge and have the video be the detective Pikachu full picture 😂 the troll one where Pikachu is dancing for 2 hours!

I love Chris Klemens! You guys should have him come back again!
Oh no
Oh no....
Tbh i actually like the human teeth :p




Pls dunt kil meh ):
I bleed for Tails
There is a difference in Disney and Paramount.  Disney is such a huge monopoly of IPs that they can say screw what the fans/audience say as they do  but with Paramount with Sonic they had to make sure that they appeased the fans to make sure as many butts in seats they can get.
While I understand the frustration and worry about how the fans were able to change the way something looked before it was released is worrisome, and had they been true to the original content I would agree, but Sonic barely looks like Sonic, so I can't really say it's the same here, simply because they weren't true to the original concept.
God I fucking love Bradon Roggers
People: OMFG HE LOOKS LIKE SHIT

Paramount: sorry we will redesign him so he looks better:

People: 
Poor Poor Dora. How you design Sonic.

Use baby eye  on baby characters Not SONIC))))

What's wrong designers. You screwed up sonic man bye.

The 3d Model designer. Must be so embarrassed

It's a mess it's a mess sonic's a mess.
Next time when kids is reacting something I want to their reacting to Three Days Grace.

>tfw they made him look like this on purpose for the sake of publicity and the realistic look was only rendered for the trailer.

0:59 no shit
he got hurt on his nutts 21:00
And how y’all gonna complain about how sonic body looks but Dr. egg man is not shaped like Dr. egg man,🤨 A.k.a. “real sonic fans”, and stop comparing sonic to Pikachu, Pikachu is not a humanoid creature like sonic is, Pikachu actually is considered an animal in his world just with powers, Sonic is a humanoid kid like hedgehog in his world and that’s the reason why he looks the way he look in the movie.
Didn't see detective Pikachu but let's be honest as much as I love Ryan Reynolds he just isn't Pikachu. If this movie works, it'll be because Jim carries it xD he would have made a better Pikachu too
one word:




sanic
Simple: the Pokemon still look like Pokemon. They did a good balance of realism and classic Pokemon aesthetics. Sonic looks like a person in a furry suit. And more importantly he looks really creepy. 

I have to question anyone who worked on the character design and said “Ya that’s good.” Like was it just an executive decision or someone doing the art direction made a boo boo.
Put kids reacting
You can make something like who framed Roger Rabbit. That would be awesome!!
the first movie company to actually listen to fans
i kinda like it tho ......
Dangmattsmith: There were some jokes our 10 YEAR OLDS can't watch this 


Me: But... 9 YEAR OLDS can.


( Pewdiepie emerges from the darkness quietly chanting  )
I am disappointed that the Game Grumps did not appear in this video, considering their history with Sonic
It isn’t that bad in my opinion it looks ok, it’s not the best but I would still watch it, just my opinion
There has been so much judgement about these movies can people just not enjoy what they're given. The online people are sometimes just jerks.
Broooo this movie as a whole looks terrible and can we talk about the shittt actors in this movie... Jim Carey would be the only good actor
They playing us like a fiddle, lmao. Any publicity is good publicity because NOW, everyone is talking about it and the movie is in the spotlight.
Legit everything but sonic looks good. Like how?
Me: 0:20 When its my turn to do the dishes....😞😞😞

I only came to watch Chris klemens  🧚🏼‍♂️

yeah cuz you both probably forgot how he actually looks like
jim carey saves every movie
They should just take the Sonic World Sonic and just throw him in there?


also when I was writing this comment and I heard Matt Smith's voice I had a mini heart attack
I didn’t even notice he was wearing dentures let alone MELTED dentures
Tails wasn't in the first game. This is sonic's first movie. So no tails.
🤔I wanna see all the haters design a live action sonic 🤔 than compare it
the sonic they made just looks like a low budget remake movie from a random country & they don't call it 'sonic' they call it 'fast hedgehog'
Toxic Youtubers
Hell yeah! FIX THE GODDAMN SONIC! MY CHILD! YOU MUTILATED HIM!

Yo, Brandon Rogers, chill

I want to have a good impression of this movie because the producers actually listened to fans and they will change Sonic.

The majority if not all of the youtubers react roster in this video is trash
Not bad.  They were all already influenced by the internet.  Reaction fail
3:09 how i felt about that Aladdin movie
KELSEAAAAAAAA
Sonic looks like the kid that turned into a CGI monkey boy in the original Jumanji
Brandon's reaction in the beginning was hilarious 😂😂
it isnt even that bad you dont look in to the details that much he looks ok
4:35 She made me wanna Ba Ha Blast my brains out.
Brandon is like how I felt After seeing the trailer.
Why can't you just let this beautiful animal be a f*cking cartoon?!
A bit disappointed that MatPat wasn't in this, I'm sure he would have had some great things to say in this episode. But I'm so grateful that Jirard is here to give the deeper analysis that we deserved.
I do not understand why they are so unhappy. Sonic looks quite OK.

This does not spark joy
Anthony Padildo ♥️
sonic is a bad game anyways
These comment sections usually will get thousands of likes in few minutes back then. Feel old yet?
The Director & Producers of this movie be like:
Hey look! They're doing a Pokèmon live action movie. Maybe we should also do another game into the big screen. Hmmm let's see,... what's another game as big as Super Mario & Pokemon: it's Sonic!!!
“Why do we need a live-action everything? Let’s leave it a fucking cartoon!” Thank you, Chris!!
I was here at 53
I'm just gonna say it... Sonic has ALWAYS looked weird as FUCK.
Me: * sees Brandon Rogers *
Me: now we know something is gonna happen
Trash video lol
Who else came here to see Anthony Padilla?
I'd rather watch the cartoon from the 90s
Am I the only one that feels like paramount made an awesome sonic design, only to release a horrid one for the trailer to generate buzz.

Because they decided to greenlight a sonic 'redesign' re quick.
People who were saying it's not THAT bad haven't played the games nor watched the animations

You want to talk about a great game turned into a really, really, REALLY BAD movie? This will end up making the Super Mario Brothers Movie look like a great movie. STOP BUTCHERING GREAT GAMES AND MAKING TERRIBLE GAME GENRE MOVIES!!!
8:42 Well in this case creators are selling a product to the audience. If the audience isn't happy with the product they're not gonna buy it. So of course they would redesign Sonic if the audience critisized it so much.
0:22 Oh wow
Oh my gosh! They got Kelsey on this! You're gonna be famous Kelsey!!💕💕

0:20 my mind when I saw the trailer
I saw Dragon Ball Evolution in theaters just to see how much of a train wreck it would be, so I’ll likely do the same with Sonic.
why is everyone talking about this and not the real movie?

0:20 when you watched how bad Sonic Live-Action Trailer was and you have to watch it again
fkn brandon rogers 😂😂
0:21 - 0:24 found the sped
People saying the audience shouldn't be allowed a voice are not thinking this through properly, any art form can be criticized and it doesn't matter if you think something is great, if the audience you're selling to says it's shit then it's probably a good idea to take that criticism and make something better. Fun fact no director, animator, or editor is perfect and no matter how many movies they work on they can still be criticized till the day they die, the animation and movie (based on the trailer) as a whole looked and felt rushed and like they didn't know what they were going for, it needs more time to develop and I'm glad they're now taking that time
They need to stop doing live action movies with the animated furry characters. I refused to see detective pikachu with that garbo look of all the pokemon and the same goes for the sonic movie
Its not that bad tho.
F that go and watch sonic x cartoon
I am so happy that Jim Carrey is in this. He's had so much crap happen in the last years. He is goofy but a class actor. He deserves this!
Sonic cartoon childfriendly 
Sonic IRL looks like a FRICKING person.But hey they are going to fix it i dont know if i am happy or surprised?
The design of the character is crap and the "plot" seems generic and bad.
Theory: The redesign was already finished, they made the terrible version of sonic for the trailer for marketing purposes.  Now after all the buzz and the trailer reaching FAR more people, they put out the statement that they're changing the design so that audience feels like they were a part of this movie.  Now the turnout will be even larger
Sonic looks terrible! What a great disappointment.... :/

1:02 and 3:06 these are my dudes!
I totaly agree with them!
They actually broke Sonic... Good thing they said they were gonna remake his look because holy sh*t how did they mess up THAT bad..
Why does it has to be live action? why cant they make the whole animated movie? There is something wrong with these film makers, first Will Smith Jinni and then this bizarre creature, I am sure next Godzilla is going to be a huge disappointment because of this "HUMAN FACTOR"
I didnt know that Shroud is a fan of sonic
5:49 when my crush makes a bad joke and no one laughs
Everone else:ewww he looks so bad


Dangmattsmith:WHARES TAILS
They should have made him look like the game version but with the same realistic features
8:44 i dont think the creator in this case, the director has any creative freedom in terms of the look of a character that already has a certain look that is expected from many. Thats the issue with adaptations imo. They are limited and expected to follow the source material and not implement what they desire
WHY FBE? WHYYYYY
MY NIGHTMARE IS HERE AGAIN
is this try not to make me mad challenge if its does congratulations its working BTW jim carry is awesome on eggman
The new Sonic looks like the little boy in the original Jumanji, when he tries to cheat and turn into a monkey....

Well well isn't it faze rug
Why is a rug in here?
It's too bad that they thought about the monetary aspect of implementing a redesign rather than the animators who are going to be overworked because of it. Can Hollywood gain an ounce of creativity?
"Why is he wearing melted dentures?" 😂
your fantasies can never be quenched can they?
Brandon Rogers you tolled me to get fired. But I am a student so I will get expelled from school.

It’s worth mentioning that on detective pikachu, they brought in a few artists who already made some pretty damn good realistic fan art to make sure it came out right
What? That's Jim Carry? Now the Film isn't that bad anymore
Okay Sonic the Hedgehog needs to have canine teeth
Jim Carrey is the best part of this trailer. Why doesn't Sonic have freaking gloves!?
Yooo FaZe Rug my G, love his vids!

FIX THE DESIGN
Why bother? I don't have time for films anyway.
I really wish they would react to Florence and the Machine.
0:19 my pp itches
With the whole audience vs creators thing...I think a key factor to remember is the content/source material of the film or show. With Sonic, the audience's opinion is much more powerful because its based on existing material that has many nostalgic links, so the filmmakers have to be careful and make sure they respect the source and enhance on it. A very good example of filmmakers failing to do this is with the Jem and the Hologram movie. It was clear that they had no regard for people who actually watched the original show, and simply targeted it towards kids. You can't work like that, nostalgia and pop culture always come into play. 


Now if the film is from an original screenplay, or perhaps based on something not that well known then the filmmakers definitely have much more leeway and things like this are less likely to be an issue. I'm not saying you can't be creative if the film/show is based on something, but you just have to be wise about it. There is a balance and regardless there will always be those who won't like it, that's life.  With Disney's Aladdin, its a bit tricky but I understand why they went with and backed up Will Smith. There was no way, as in noooo way they could reproduce anything similar to Robin William's Genie (RIP), and it would be disrespectful to try. The best next thing is to go in a new direction, and have a different version of the Genie, which is why they went with Will Smith who naturally brings his own distinct character to the role. Some will like it, some won't.

There are actually studies on robots which show that we as humans like to see a robot that's clearly looking like a robot or a robot that looks very human like. But everything in between where it looks sort of human-like but not really, that's gross and terrifying to humans. Simular to what happend here.

Sonic looks like my brother
He is so f up I love  sonic but it is f up
Disney paid like $30 million for Will Smith to be in Aladdin, of course they won't change the look of the genie after all the outrage. Sonic would be easier to change than the genie would.
I know it's all about money but why do we need a live action of every animated thing ever?!
at least they are trying to rectify their mistake.
Can Joey Graceffa get any more swishy?
I'm not even gonna be surprised if they'll make a little Einstein's movie.

i will go and watch it.  if a company. goes out of he's way to remake something in a movie, which will cost them more time and money .  i will support that by watching it. i do think how ever. that who ever agreed to the first sonic should get slapped,    ''how bad it was''  i honestly think a toddler would have done better.
Snooping as usual, I see?
I saw FaZe Rug , I Clicked
I'm a simple man, I see Anthony, I click
HEADLINE OF THE WEEK:
Jim Carey reported to have a sore and/or injured back after forcefully being made to carry the heavy weight of the entire sonic movie. Gary Fulton up next with more...
My reaction was about the same like these people in the videos, but Jim Carey? That what makes me considering 🤣
This is the channel where overreaction takes place.

the only thing wrong with sonic is his body not his face mostly his legs lol
“The one on the left looks like a furry costume”

Ok, first of all they’re called Fursuits and second of all that kind of quality is unheard of in the furry community, maybe in the 80’s but certainly not now. That quality is what you get with Chinese knockoffs. But I’m fine with it as you’re obviously not knowledgeable about the furry fandom, just please if your gonna make comments like that please can you do some research.
Can you imagine if we had social media in 1998. Godzilla outrage intensifies
I don't get why every goddamn YouTubers keeps swearing in lots of fucking videos. I fucking hate Youtubers. They should all die and burn in hell.
If you can suspend your reality for a talking blue hedgehog that has super powers then they could keep the design true to the original and it would work. We don’t need his design to be realistic ok dude in red shirt?
Doesnt Cartoon Sonic also has human teeth?  I mean he ate a lot of chilli dogs.
Stevie is not a youtuber, what is she doing here.
WELL I DON'T HAVE A JOB ALSO HOW DOES HAVING AN OPINION MAKE YOU LOSE AN FREAKING JOB this is my problems with youtubers.
When i watched it i was a stupid
It's so weird to me how they were so passionate and quick to criticis the design but won't be seeing the movie
Anthony went from emo kid to a young Q from impractical Jokers
0:35 the song is the best part the f&uk you drinking
Honestly no one frikin asked for this movie,  there are a lot of other things that are movie worthy,  not sonic please
people need less time on their hands ...  I played Sonic games and even used to watch the series ... This Sonic does not bother me, and crying over it makes you pathetic.
Pls react to the most extraordinary met gala gowns/suits

I don't care....

i came to watch reaction of gotta go fast memes
Forgive me but...I don’t mind the live action sonic

Edit: never mind...just looked at the teeth and I hate the design
The Director made Sonic eyes so Horrible even the teeth and everything it looks very stupid
Elders react to Rocky
OMG!! FAZE RUG!!!
Honestly I saw it I sent it multiple times I still don't see what all the fuss is about I don't know why they have to have to look exactly like it did in the cartoon why nothing.
if you were working with your own IP its fine to be creative... but if your working on a beloved franchise you have to seriously take the fans into consideration they are the ones going to buy your product after all...


i mean look at what happened to Starwars... was a Starwars  fanboy for 20 years but now nope never seeing another movie again... the bad plot and response to criticism has left a bad taste in my mouth so even if they retcon the last 3 movies it would still be tainted...  ive moved on to Warhammer 40,000
If you ask me the director phoned up the CGI animators and described Sonic over the phone, as the animators had never actually seen a Sonic game or cartoon.
That's the only way it makes sense, because anyone who has ever seen Sonic wouldn't create that.
PLEASE tell me Jirard was playing devils advocate...
Why pikachu got accepted by fans & sonic not ?
Bacause pikachu have Ryan Reynolds !!!
honestly, we are all Brandon Rogers-
3:35 is Anthony really getting oversensitive over this joke? He made waaaay worse jokes back in the day.
Reaction on 'King's United compilation' in world of dance ...pretty please...just check it out ... It will blow all of your minds.

Publicity stunt. Its easy to have two characters. It worked easily cause that's people now days.
React to PRETTYMUCH 😁😁
Sonic looks like a furry
@12:06 The fact that we as an audience can change the development of a medium, (like how the outcry with the Sonic design), it is a bit of a double edged sword since there are times we get what we asked for, but not quite how we pictured it. In other words it can go really good or really bad
If you Think doesnt look bad, go and see the Twitter of the creators of sonic, and you can tell they didnt like it also, and you can not argue with the people who Made Sonic.
0:20 is my reaction to sonic trailer as well lmao
All Hail Jim Carrey!
His teeth look like those fuggler dolls😆 Google it and you'll see
Me : Being Peaceful.
Brandon Rogers : 0:20 to 0:24
Me : Wth man, im being peaceful here and u do this to me?
FBE you dont have enough feminine soy boys...please put more!
It took approximately 3.5 seconds for Brandon to lose it
Im sorry, but the design and visuals is what makes most of the movie, wether people like it or not. You watch the movie, because the trailers look good enough that you'll say "ok, I wouldn't mind seeing this" at the very least.

If Sonic, the main character and focus of this movie, looks like... THAT, then no one will want to watch it.
(Not in theaters anyway.)
The only ones that will are critics, that's it. So the movie will do poorly.

It's like... a plate of food.
Yes, it might taste good, but it has to be presented/look good to.
Because you eat with your eyes first.
This whole situation wouldn't have happened if they pre-tested the design by showing it to Sonic fans. This mess is on them. What was supposed to create hype around a movie created the exact opposite.
Sonic looks like a good movie. The haters were never fans of classic sonic cartoons and you can tell.
How could they even release it without showing it to a few real fans to have a first look at it? That's just greed!!!
What about Generations react to Danish food?
Are they going to make a movie for every game
Brandon Roger’s reaction is the best! 🤣
1:03 - nope, keep going, you're absolutely correct
8:50  an artist making something NEW can be as creative as he wants, he'll be judged nontheless. HOWEVER trying to "redesign" something as iconic and well-known as Sonic and expect everyone to be on board with it is just STUPID! How can you be this oblivious? 😕😕😕
Brandon is the best
1:35 He looks like Matt Raub from Smosh Games...
Why is nobody talking about his ring portals?
Rap music has no place in a sonic movie.
He's right 8:41
Whoever hates on this movie. Is dumb. You are not a true fan if u hate this. Yeah ik. The body is fucked. But that shouldnt matter. This movie looks amazing and I cant wait to watch it
Sonic is like the movie equivalent to when U2 gave everyone their album out of the kindness of their hearts
Sonic looks like one really 
 f u c k e d up Pokémon

I’m so disappointed that the movie comes out in the same month as my Birthday
Why are people more hyped on the Pokémon movie? Because Pokémon is orders of magnitude larger brand than Sonic.
I think his episode had a lot of great creators. I hope they make sonic look better.
For the people saying "its not that bad"…… you guys will go to hell
At this point we should prepare for when they live action Monsters Inc 🤦‍♂️
Like I’m like Faze Rug like
i dunno but it looks normal to me... 

don't hate me
I'm disappointed in Jirard. With how much he's a Sonic fan, even defending Sonic Unleashed, I didn't expect him to defend and asskiss the design and director this much. What happened to you man?

I h8 it too but is this for real!?
My boi ruggggg
lol I just realised the sonic movie is made for children but they didnt realise that children play fortnite, and the last last last generation kids play sonic whom are now adults
Is no one gonna mention the fact that  transformers was mentioned in this...the end is near people😢
Sonic has 1 eye
i think i’m the only one who doesn’t hate the sonic character 👀
Like the fact that they swear a lot even tho they pg
Ok no one said it so I have to... Jim Carrey is Dr. Eggman!!
Thank god they're redesigning Sonic

Im glad their even going back through a lot of the movie and change his model
Because this is going to FAIL we will never get a Mega-Man live action film

Poor Jim Carry is going to need a fucking chiropractor after all this. 


Helps with the back pain from carrying the entire fucking movie.
Jirard Khalil is full of shit at 8:42. First, the 'creator' didn't create that abomination in the trailer. The audience is going ape shit for making that creature for NOT making the creation like it was supposed to look like by the CREATOR(s) of sonic.

I still think they purposely put it out bad for media hype lol
The Compitionist is here? Wut? That's awesome
They knew it would be a bad movie,so they got Jim Kerrie.
If you use a 30 years old character and use it to make a movie, you are not "creating" anything but the story.

hence, do what you want with the story, but don't butcher other people's creations. A 30 years old character is not open to interpretation.

It is made for fans and if fans do not like the design, they will not like the movie, even if it is the best movie ever.
0:22 holy shit he pissed!!
13:00 I agree with him, I think that if this doesn't work after they change it, everyone loses 😥
Okay maybe I zoned out but NO ONE is talking about the fact the movie looks bad! Fix sonic all you want but this movie looks like it should be a Disney Channel/Cartoon network/Nickelodeon original movie. Like Jim Carrey looks bad too.
Why is Anthony considered as a YouTuber?
They should have mentioned that SEGA themselves didn't like the design but apparently Paramount decided to ignore that. Look what that did HMMMMM.

why not showing the creator of sonic worry about the movie
Red shirt thinking too deep
There's a thing called the Uncanny Valley and this sonic lands in that for sure...that's why people are so upset about it. The uncanny valley makes people super uncomfortable
The Pikachu movie - My biggest pet peeve: PIKACHU FLIPPIN' TALKS!!! WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?!?! This ruins the whole movie for me. Pikachu NEVER spoke unless it was saying his  own name. This ruins it for me tbh.
I'll wait til it's on Amazon or Netflix or Hulu because I hate movie theaters
It's really not that bad
I'm pumping the brakes on this one.  "Detective Pikachu" looks great.  "Aladdin" and the Genie in particular look better to me than others say.  You can fix the CGI Sonic, but outside of Jim Carrey, nothing from this trailer made me laugh.  This might be the first frontrunner for the 2020 Razzie for Worst Picture.
The guy in the red is too passionate about defending the sonic director and them
brandon is a fucking mood
jim carry saves d day
Guy in red shirt seems like a butt muncher for executives.

Yeah there comes a time when you have to say you fucked up. The sonic creators on this film fucked up.
NAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOU
Some of yall are so mean. maybe the animators were young and still developing their skills. Plus, Jim Carrey is back! Some of you have no more kid hearts and it shows.
Love the way Stevie’s eyebrows twitch when she talks it’s so cool
0:21 I don't know what he said but...





Honestly I agree.
The main thing I didn't like was the eyes... Otherwise it would look ok
My homie faze rug !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Faze up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I totally forgot! 

WHERE THE FUCK IS TAILS!?

Out of all the shit happening today, is it sad that People’s biggest issue is how sonic...looks? ITS NOT THAT BAD!
in end game they should of had sonic in it, I haven't seen it but that would make it a 10/10
What’s next? Super mario??
They better fucking PAY THEIR ANIMATORS OVERTIME!!!!!!
People hated it ... their knew their could make a history
Faze rug was in this video omggg
If people really hate it then the directors know that they are definitely doing something wrong here 😬
Part of this was filmed in my town. I got to watch the fireball scene being filmed with part of the film crew. A 50 foot tall fireball in the middle of my town. It was amazingly cool. People may hate this movie but the making of it was one of the most amazing things I got to witness in my entire life. Meeting the film crew, serving them at my place of work, seeing actors around town it was all amazing and the crew was so wonderful around town. VERY considerate and kind.
The outrage with the Genie in Aladdin is just because he's not Robin Williams, but there's nothing that can be done about that.

The outrage with Sonic was that the character looks like a person in poorly made Sonic pajamas.
anthony doesn't get to complain he voiced the main character in a chinesse ripoff called hedgehog he doesn't get the right
I mean if they made sonic from the original and worked with sega animation with a similar to cartoons they wouldnt deal with the rework, detective pikachu is dead on to the acutal pickachu so
Am i the only one who think when i first watched this trailer that its note bad until internet found out its bad
React to Pearl Jam

Yeah i'd like to see Tails in the movie 😁
YouTubers react to Judge Caprio
Why is it that every time theres a movie based on a video game, it feels like the people making the movie never actually played the goddamn game???
Just be happy they are redoing the look of Sonic because of the outrage they have gotten from the preview
Plz react to the kings world of dance
Jeff Fowlers response is somewhat ill-advised... His claim that they are committed to making Sonic "the BEST he can be", if they fail to fix what they have done and meet fan expectations then what will it say about the potential of Sonic? That they have done everything they could but "this" is as good as it can get so it wasnt their fault, it was the character.
FBE has access to all youtubers
Am I the only person who actually liked the trailer;; I guess, but they really could improve with his details
Should have had Arin Hanson for this YouTubers React.
“I’m not trying to be mean but, come on you need to lose your job!” Brandon omg 😂
Pokemon is still relevant.
Here are some of the differences between the live action Sonic the Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu movies:
 -  Detective Pikachu has a spot on design. Sonic does not. 
 -  Detective Pikachu is set in an interesting world. Sonic is not.
 -  Detective Pikachu appeals to fans of all ages. Sonic is more aimed at children. 

Here are some good points to the Sonic movie: Jim Carrey.................. and that's about it...
I fell like this movie is supposed to be something like an origin story. Because the cartoon started with everyone on earth knowing sonic or at least acknowledges his existence.
Omg Sony the hedgehog
If only one person reads this it would really make my day.I know fame doesn’t occur over night but I am trying my best to become a youtuber. Wish me luck and it would mean a lot if you subbed👍🏼
What they need to do is make it like an actual freakin blue hedgehog and animate it like G-Force
Damm missed Jim Carey
Thank God They Will Redesign Sonic Long Live This Thing
I never played Sonic but even I saw the trailer and was like "WTF kind of furry is that"
Kids React To Eddsworld
Why must you subject people to torture.
Me: " Is then new Sonic movie good? "
Jim: " No, but thank you for asking."
Theory: paramount did this on purpose so it would get media attention and now people will be more likely to go to the theaters to see what the redesign looks like
Sonic kinda looks cute
Holy shit!! Motha fukin Chris Klemens!
Give it a chance what might look bad might actually be good it is like old video games from the 90s
Brandon Rogers just fucking looses his shit and it's been like 4 seconds and the trailer hasn't been shown yet. XD
Also a big difference between both movies is that detective pikachu is an immersion into a Pokemon universe with a lot of intriguing world building involved and sonic the hedgehog is introducing sonic to are universe doesn't seem as interesting as the immersion option o_0
I like it ans d I hate sonic
If the new version looks good i would go.
This is what trailers should be for to help with the production
why is he so humanoid why does his eyes look like that and WHERE IS HIS GLOVES!?
My friend said to not watch the trailer...
I watched it...
I regret everything...
so people would rather have a  blue cyclops hedgehog with polio... good to know that people are idiots.
Not to mention Detective Pikachu looks like it has a better plot than the Sonic movie.
Detective Pikachu: we made a live action movie




Sonic Hedgehog: hold my Ring-0 s





Audience: hold our beer
After Rocky and Bullwinkle, after Mario Brothers, after Doom, I plan to skip this one.

Also, no "uhm's" and "Ahh's" either. Learn to speak properly please.
Why does this anthropomorphic creature lived between regular humans? Why can't it exist in a cartoonish world, interacting with other cartoonish characters?
My favorite are dangmatt and rug
Please do youtubers react to the final godzilla trailer.

This is insane!! Why are the teeth the only thing that people are concerned about? It looks like shit
And the completetionist wonders why his views are down maybe this asshole should consider listening to criticism. The artist can make all the art in the earth and  have no views.
i wanted a kirby movie


plus it will be better if it’s animated
WHAT HAPPENED TO ANTHONY'S HAIR!?
Like I don't get how it's bad ik it might not look like the regular Sonic but they just wanted to make it more realistic just like the Pikachu movie and Sonic movie and the new Lion King movie right?I'm only 10 yrs old lol 🤣:/
did Joey actually say he would wait until it was on VHS ?! LOL
NO MORE TEETH NO MORE TEETH!!

Any movie with Jim Kerry is a awesome movie and he even  makes a movie with the weirdest main character awesome but it’s only the parts he’s in

Is no one gonna talk about brandons scream in the beginning?
This movie is the embodiment of "Thanks, I hate it."
There are 2 things that need to be fixed... 

1- Sonic NEEDS to look BETER! 

1- TAILS NEEDS TO BE IN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Addendum, NEEDS BETTER WRITING!!!!!!!!!!
I love how passionately Brandon reacted to this one XD He pretty much epitomized how the internet feels about this movie.
There’s a story in every sonic game
If they fix it, they have to do a completly new movie, i meant HE is the star
why LaurDIY always speaks like she raps?
You should put faze rug more of this videos
As a sonic fan Im super hyped to watch this no matter how much of a mess it is!
0:22 when your mom doesn't buy you v-bucks
Might as well have Dwayne Johnson play Sonic at this point
We can only hope that the plot AND Jim Carrey carry this movie to at least moderate success.
That’s hoping, lads and lassies.
if i was on the episode the moment i found out it would be for the sonic movie  i would have just left straight away
I really want Rhett and Link to come on the show. Also didn’t expect to see FaZe Rug to be on this show!
0:20 that psychotic scream :v
I watched the trailer more than 3 times and I'm already used to the design
That guy with the red shirt. He.
Faze ruggg!!!
Yeeesssss I only came for Brandon Rodgers and Chris klemens
I would prefer to watch Sonic X than this nonsense movie.
Pikachu doesn't have that much to him
I have one thing to say, MORE CHRIS KLEMENS!

I don't mind live action I just don't understand why they made him so.... human. He's a hedgehog. It's an animal that exists in the real world. They could've just made it like Scooby Doo, or Rocky and Bullwinkle, or hell, Who Framed Roger Rabit. It feels like someone saw the Pokemon trailer and were like... yes.
0:20 It's us when someone liked the trailer
First genie now sonic... can anyone not be offended for once seriously. Honestly sonic doesn’t look that bad
Personally I am excited for detective pikachu a lot more
Irritated in how negative a lot of this is. As a 90s baby I'm super excited to see it. I dont think it's as bad as a lot of people are saying.
Besides anthony this is just "adults" react for me at this point
Arin would've been perfect for this episode
The thing is that the Sonic team have not consulted with the fans for years about what they want. Just look at the games!
Yey
Teens react to grace vanderwaal 




I've been waiting for six months
I agree with Hammersmith i need tails
...and they made one about PiKacHu
Still seeing this no matter what, I don't care how bad or good he looks, still seeing this. For the design, I'm fine with it, it's just the teeth to me that needs to be changed. Also it's cool they got an actual Sonic fan in the video.

But I saw some people complain about the ring portal mechanic and I'm like, have you not played Sonic 3&K and Mania, they were portals then!
0:21 best sceam ever
Didn’t recognize Antony Padilla in the cover photo 🤣
4:37 right....
My thing is don’t studios go through screen tests with audience members to see how the public will react to the movie, like months before the studio releases a trailer? It makes me wonder if they had done this with Sonic yet, or at all. If they did, how was this not an issue that was raised at that moment?

In a way this trailer -the first official look of Sonic - acted like a screen test, but on a wider, way less controlled scale. I mean granted not everyone is going to like whatever version of Sonic or redo of Sonic they do, but it would not have been this big of a deal. They also wouldn’t have only six months left before the movie is released to fix an entire movie with the redo Sonic, including other teasers, toys, etc. It makes you wonder how much money they could possibly have going  down the drain just by doing the redesign, and if in doing the redesign will keep it from flopping completely in the box office.

Don't worry guys they are going to fix it because they said that the trailer wasn't the real deal
Theyre changing the design yayy
Sanic better collect all the gems and go super sayan
I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought the tiny humanoid hands were part of the problem. I think the movie has the potential to be so-bad-its-funny and maybe funny on its own.
I hate the new sonic movie and the trailer it is all horrible it is a mistake and I want to jump of a bridge because someone created a live action sonic movie
as an (albeit very amateur) animator I feel bad for the cgi artists who are forced to redo practically this entire movie.
like c'mon the design isn't 1110% an abomination (excluding those how small his face is and those FRICKING TEETH) but let's be honest it could be much worse.
HOW DID YOU GET JON SNOW ON HERE
maybe they don’t know what hedgehog supposed to look like
Just a heads up, they spent like over $150,000 million for the sonic animation itself
Yall can eat some dog shit
I like the Sonic design since he really looks like what would be from an Apocalyptic Version Of Earth just like in the archie comics which sadly died last year after running for 20 years
people who said the design is not that bad, go to hell :)

Seriously who asked for this film..?
Can y'all give my new song a listen please? I feel scummy for self promoting but I worked 10 hours on it

I also think that, even tho we‘re always saying that Nintendo is a controllfreak, Detective Pikachu looks so damn fine because according to the director fron DP, they had to go to every design, writing choices three times times to get the okay from the Pokemon Team and Nintendo.

The Sonic Team and Sega however, are obviously very lost about they main mascot. Previous games as an example. It‘s like Gerard said: They don‘t have an identity for Sonic anymore because the „Cool 90‘s kid charm“ has been worn off. 

So, if they already have no clue about to make Sonic in the games, how could they make a good advisor for a film team.
I hope Jim Carey’s back is strong enough to carry this movie. I give this one chance, ONE CHANCE, because I love the man so much...

Brandon’s reaction is gold 😂
Maybe in a few years a knuckles movie will come out, then you could plug the Sonic movie into it and watch a semi new movie with both... Hats off to anyone who gets this.
Sonic was my childhood, but watching this honestly got me so mf confused
Imagine when the new design for sonic is so much worse than the original version
react to Homicide (logic and eminem)
The difference here is that Sonic has been a beloved character for decades, and this redesign is too much for some people, myself included.
The Pokemon in 'Detective Pikachu' look so good because they didn't change the proportions or the overall design... They just added texture, shading and depth.
You can still play 'Who's that Pokemon?' With the live-action versions of these characters.
Sonic looks like a creepy little man in a furry suit and it's pretty genuinely upsetting.
That being said, I'm excited to see the redesign and absolutely STOKED for Jim Carrey as Robotnik. Hopefully the film does well despite this rocky start!
"I dont remember anyone asking for this." 😂😂
The one thing with this and why it got so big is because it's a character thats been around for years and has a developed style and look already. Then they just changed it for the movie for some reason, still unclear on that one... but it would be like taking Pikachu and instead of a lightning bolt tail he just has a straight tail. Except in that situation people might just start WW3...
Brandon’s reaction is all of us
chirs klmeens is stupid does everyone wish he was dead

Did sonic have fur? No one mentions the fur. I think that creeps me out more than the other things. Also, yes, if tails is not in it, I have an issue

Dang Jim Carrey is in this!!!! Awesome!!!!!
I'd go see Sonic. It's cool that the producers are willing to redesign Sonic because of the negativity but it's sad that they are letting the customer control their art. Now the keyboard warrior will feel entitled to tell studios how to design the characters. A live action adaptation is basically a re-imagining of the original work so of course there's bound to be some differences in design. He didn't look bad, just a little different but you can still tell it's Sonic. I just hate how people want to complain about a movie they've never seen or help to make.
React to spongebob squarepants 20th anniversary memes
The only reason why I’m only excited for Detective Pikachu is that they used real life models and as for Sonic, they should have tried. They tried to make him more human rather than sticking to his somewhat original design.
React to Dora and the lost city of gold
I really disagree with the red shirt kid.
i feel like if they are going to put the time and effort into redesign, pitch a few models to the audience before full blown replacing it, in a case like this, i feel like thats the safest bet. i really hope for the best, i love sonic yo
hey my boi faze rug

When sonic looks like he could potentially get a girlfriend in it - there’s a huge issue. And detective pikachu is untouchable! (And I’m not a fan of Pokémon at all!)

Jim looks amazing btw.
Come on, just give the movie a chance
Some people ask where Tails is. The movie’s plot is basically Sonic The Hedgehog 1. If they ever decide to make a sequel I could see Tails finally making an appearance (Sonic The Hedgehog 2).

The thing is not EVERYTHING work for live action and in realistic design on top if that
faze rug didnt have mouth to talk
There's a fan made video about Sonic(cartoon) with Gangsta Paradise bgm. it was uploaded years ago, Someone from the production team probably saw that vid and liked the song for the trailer. I guess.

Did you see the Sonic AMV-Gangster's Paradise video, that was released 13 years ago?
Brandon Rogers reaction at the beginning is hilarious.
I actually like Sonic's colour palette, also the teeth aren't that bad, like with Pikachu I think we all took some time to accept a 40 year old voicing the character, similarly we will take a shit ton of time to get used to the teeth
Sonic the Hedgehog the movie looks like Chuck-E-Cheese the rat
I mean I agree the Sonic movie trailer looked stupid, and the animation was horrible, but trying so hard to do what people want has some problems too. If all you ever do is stuff you know people will like they’ll never get to experience new things, new styles, new stories. Sometimes people don’t know what they want and often what is popular during a time is not what stands the test of time.
I agree, why do they need to make a live-action everything, leave it a FUCKING cartoon for fucks sake🙄
Why is he getting so much hate he is fine
I was okay with the look but when that tweet with the edit, I saw the horror
People are saying that it’s gonna take a lot more time and money to fix Sonics design...well you wanna make a cartoon into live action you better make it look good
FAZE RUG!!!!!!
There are so many famous YouTube or’s
Brandon is a mood lmao
Next movie is Mario n I don’t think sonic looks that bad
I take what I said about sonic back by comparison to his cartoon counterpart

Fucking Brandon's reaction tho😂
Okay so the red shirt guy said that pokemon, which took about 2 years to make with Nintendo and Gamefreak making sure that the designs are good to audience and he agreed with them,  is something that is good and that pokemon took time. He does not realize  from when he said that statement stating that Hollywood and audience does not mix. He does not know that Sega is working on this movie that made the movie with Paramount... Detective Pikachu took time to make sure to get it right.

I'm not saying that anyone is wrong with how their reacting to the Sonic trailer, since everyone's experience is different.  But i didn't hate this trailer, and it had some really really REALLY cool moments.  If they maintain that awesome Sonic action i still think that it would still be worth seeing regardless of how bad Sonic may look to people.  I honestly didn't think that he looked that bad, I expected worse after the posters......   I think that what makes or breaks an adaptation of a character is whether or not you can look at him/her at one point in the trailer and go, "Yeah, that's them."  Which is something that i was able to do with Sonic, when Eggman had surrounded him with his robots near the end of the trailer.   Sonic put his hands on his waist in kind of a cocky looking pose, and i immediately thought to myself, "yeah, that's Sonic right there."
Brandon Rodgers why haven't you made a another episode

Bro what the fuck is the completionist on about
I see the issues with Live Sonic's design, but my real issue with it... is everything else. I don't really like Jim Carrey, so that's a negative for me. The plot looks pretty stupid: "he's so fast that it knocks out the power so the military is after him now"? Oh, and by the way, he might be an alien? (He said "I have to save YOUR world".) The rings are portals? And for some reason, 90s gangster hip-hop is the first choice in trailer music? Everything about this movie seems like one bad decision piled on top of another. No way am I seeing this.
KELSEEEEEEY 💖
where’s the thicc sonic memes?
Wtf did they do to sonic!!!
The sonic movie could be good if they don't take it seriously
Damn Jim Carrey can still pull it off he's so handsome and such a legend
Even the ORIGINAL creators are on board with the fans request for changes.

Anothony is killing me like just watch

They tried to go for an realistic look

2:57 YES FINALLY SOMEBODY POINTS IT OUT! HIS LEGS MAKE ME FEEL SO UNCOMFORTABLE!
FBE... hope y’all told the reactors that they are fixing the look of Sonic after an outrage for the look of Sonic in the first trailer
You did sonic the hedgehog but not Star Wars.... I see
This is a
I really think the biggest problem with the design was practically everything. Sure, you can tell it's Sonic, but only because he's blue and has those spikes. Everything about him is weird. Sonic looks great because he's not realistic. They gave him an almost human like body. It's so weird. The teeth don't really bug me that much, but the mouth and the eyes are extremely weird as well. Sonic is a cartoon character, and I'm not surprised people are upset and weirded out by this. 

I will say though, that I agree with Jirard. They really need to be careful in letting the fans control them like that. But also, they shouldn't have let Sonic look like that to begin with. I just hope they succeed in making the character look better, and stick with it. No matter what they come up with, people will complain still, and they can't back down after that.

I'm not a bif fan of Sonic but if someone make a movie about Mario and if they make him taller and without mustache I'd be really pissed off... so I understand.
Jared out here being smart. Being considerate. Really thinking about everyone.
Sonic is approaching the uncanny valley with his character design while pikachu actually looks like a creature that could exist. Also pikachu looks huggable.
They should have just made the movie like the looney toons live action movie. That’s definitely better than this weird were-hedgehog.

“He’s not that bad” are you kidding me he looks like a guy in a green suit have you even watched or played sonic
I wonder if at the end of the Sonic movie they’ll tease a sequel with Shadow and/or Chaos as the villains. Obviously Shadow would turn out to be actually an anti hero
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!! Dangmattsmith is there fave youtuber(≧▽≦)(≧▽≦)(≧▽≦)(≧▽≦)
Why the heck does Sonic literally look like a mutated who from Dr. Suess????🤣
They said Sonic eyes will be different now from the trailer. His eyes is more like in the game or cartoon Sonic we knew.

I agree the eyes on sonic are way different from the gamey one and cartoon one. And the teeth👎👎👎. I think that the maker of it should change it a little bit better not going to lie

To answer  the Red Shirt guys question about when should a creator create, the first time the story is being told, any time after that is a new interpretation and could be taken in a different direction... That's why comic book movies aren't play by plays of an existing comic, they just take influences from the story.
All I know is this if you ever do make a live action Digimon movie or crash bandicoot movie they better not mess it up.
To comment on 4:49. REMEMBER SPACE JAM!!!!!! ITS THIS LITTLE MOVIE THAT DID INCREDIBLY WELL!!!! AND I DONT REMEMBER A LIVE ACTION BUGS BUNNY!!!!!!

Remember when Jirard reviewed Sonic Unleashed and talked about the werehog bringing that the werewolf transformation is man to wolf and then how werehog was supposed to be hedgehog to man. This is Sonic Unleashed the movie
I don’t have a soul...
I hate this trailer not because how he looks but, because sonic was never able to throw rings and make them teleporters he was never fast enough to stop time because sonic can barely run at the speed of sound but yet he can stop time???????
Who asked for a sonic the hedgehog movie
Please  react to the whole album of Map of the Soul: Persona that just came out, it's a BOP! And also the live performance of Dionysus too, it's interesting how they take some Greek influences into their work. Each song has such a good meaning. If you do react to it us ARMYs would be very grateful. Thank you!!
I didn't ask for another HOP movie
8:42 is a good argument when its a singular vision being used for a film, but Sonic has, from his creation, been a marketing driven conglomerate, so to have the consumers dictate to the producers how they want the product to be in this case it makes sense. Even then, however, authors have been changing the course of their stories based on audience reaction for over a century, from LOST creators adapting their scripts based on fan theories to Charles Dickenson who would release stories serially and change where it was going based on word of mouth review amongst the public.
They literally don’t look that bad tho

As much as I appreciate the director/studio listening to consumers and promising to fix the character design, I do feel bad for all the developers who are working on this because now they're probably in a major period of crunch.

Giving a like for Jirard, he's such a nice person.
Is not frinking weird is cool
Imo it’s not that bad
i thought it wasn’t that bad...maybe cuz i only played a sonic game once
My problem with this is not only the horrible design of the character, but also it is too much human interaction, which is what strikes me as weird. Why does it have to be a story about Sonic saving humans? Why can't it be a story revolving around the many different characters we've seen in all the games? Where are Tails, Amy, Shadow, etc?
They released the shitty version on purpose and already have the "fixed" version made.

If Kelsey is in it this video is good
2:17 "That is not Sonic."
You're right, that's Sanic.
I loved having Stevie in this! I feel like since she does more of the managing side of GMM she had some really interesting insights, plus I just love her <3
redesign him pls for the love of god
Rug made it making San Diego people proud brother !

0:22 this guy knows what's going on
I think pikachu in the live action is adorable but some of the other pokemon... nahhh. And I hope sonic does get a good fix
I can't wait to watch the episode where they react to the updated trailer
Personally I think there is no need for a sonic movie .
React to the Joker trailer!!!
@chris Klemens I stand ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i think pikachu looks great but the rest of the pokemon in the movie look about as bad as sonic
8:55 Words of true wisdom and kindness
Why they don’t talk about that theory that all this was setting? (the Sonic in the oficia trailer was a joke to get more views, supposedly).
why so many of them look like battyman
I’m so happy they got Jirard on here! He’s such an underrated youtuber!
Now we need the Minecraft Movie.
I actually likes how Sonic looks.
Yay Chris & Stevie!
5:00 HOW THE HELL IS THAT REAL???? HE HAS HUMAN TEETH AND A HUMAN BODY!!!!

Omg I was surprised to see Chris, then Stevie!
Thank goodness they’re changing Sonics design
I love how everyone's reaction was so similar "OMG!!!!" 😂
Sammy the frik was right
I see faze rug I CLICK
Edit: DANGMATTSMITH?! YESSSSSSSSSSS
you should include the sonic trailer in a try not to get mad challenge and see who loses their shit
If your animator  this will look super bad.....
If you make him look exactly like in the games, it will just look like a fan made sfm video on a green screen and then placed on the real world. It won't work. Plus there are lots of kids who have always wanted to see sonic in the real world. Now unless you want a story about a kid who wishes for their favorite videogame character  to come to our world, it will then work, like how Rodger rabbit did, but that's because they are SUPOSED to be cartoon characters made out of paint and ink, sonic in this movie is a living creature and not a character that poped out of a game or lives in a video game universe like ready player one so he has to look realistic and have believable proportions. BUT, you have to make it appealing as well. I have seen fan art of sonic in a furry kind of art style and people loved it and he looks cute, on a lot of angles sonic actually looks really good. It's really just the mouth that really off putting because he has a human mouth with human teeth in which can be very disturbing actually. Another thing that they might need to change is the shape of his muzzle because it gets narrow nd that gives off the Whovilian look from the Grinch. His eyes look fine but giving them expressions is what made it hard when done with motion capture because he didn't look too surprised or expressive when he screams.
Robotnik doesn’t look anything like the original: it’s ok
Sonic resembles his original look a bit: everyone hates it
I heavily agree with brandon lmao
Would have clicked so much fast if I had known Kelsey was in this!!
Fix the f***king eyes and the f***king gloves/hands and your good boo
Why, why would you get Faze Rug on here?
The fact is, audiences are the only point of making a movie. So your goal is always to please them, otherwise they just won't pay you.
Smosh or anthony padilla

Video-anthony

Me-k then
That guy in the red shirt... doesnt think the design is that bad? Doesnt think the sonic design would work in the live adaptation? Hes gotta be a furry change my mind
OMG FAZE RUG IS IN HERE 😂💀😱
RUG
To me the fact that they're changing the design just makes the director look like a huge pushover
I wish they would have kept it as the original cartoon 😣
Brandon Rogers represents everyone when it came out
F For Respect
9:23 THIS IS A MOOD
Jim Carrey will be the saving grace of this movie.
elders react to: Sabaton!
0:23 my exact reaction
I mean having him look realistic makes sense, it's not like a Roger Rabbit or Space Jam thing where he's coming out of a SEGA Genesis or whatever? But yeah, his eyes and mouth (oh god the human teeth ew) and his proportions need to be tweaked.
If this actually turns out good we're going to regret every thought we had
What is that human like features

YAAAAAS JIRAAAAARD!!!!
Jim Carey is almost the whole reason why people are gonna see sonic the hedgehog

well i guess being called sonic is an insult now
Its not that bad, its just it looks really weird

Does Sonic get his speed from the Speed Force?
YES BRANDON ROGERS IS ON HERE
Saw rug, and had to click on this
Brandon Rogers reaction to the trailer, was me the whole time.
First Dora, then Pikachu, and now Sonic. Wow.👏🏻
Who else is willing to see it just for Jim Carey?
IIRC Detective Pikachu actually brought on board a fan artist that made realistic Pokemon pictures to help out with the designs. Probably why it looks so much better than what they did to our boy Sonic
At the 20th second looks like when the condom fails and the pregnancy test is positive
They are either trying to do what detective Pikachu is doing or is failing to get people talking about it so people pack the theaters... Either way it's as bad as the new Aladdin genie...
Jim is literally the Carry for this movie
This creature looks like Thing 1 and Thing 2's crackhead cousin
Hotbananastud's reaction to this trailer at the beginning made this entire video for me hahahahah
Guy in blue is being too extra
"A furry costume" 😂😂😂
0:19 totally me
You guys should do reacting to Top 10 BBMAs performances (where they list them)
00:21 That's basically my reaction LMAO
I think instead of reanimating sonic they should just drop it and send the animators to therapy or prison.
https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/05/artist-fixes-live-action-sonic-the-hedgehog
honestly please get this artist to make sonic.....looks like the real thing instead of a child-like man painted blue

To me Faze rug looks like sonic...no shade(but shade).

Also, why would it be a bad thing that people can influence movies like this? Okay, so a major factor of the movie is the audience's reaction to it, and are they really gonna do nothing when they realize the people they're putting all this time and effort out for aren't liking what they're seeing? No one's forcing them at all, Disney kept what they did with the Jeanie. Nobody forced Paramount to change Sonic, but seeing how negatively people were responding to Sonic's look, it's cool that they can get that kinda feedback so easily and have the choice to do something about it to appease Sonic's fans! Yes, I do feel kinda bad that they are going through all that, but I'm happy to see that they're responsive to their fans and trying hard to try and give the people what they'd enjoy. Best of luck to them!
OMG HE LOOKS FINE
Ayeeeee RUG
How can someone screw up with Sonic the hedgehog?!?!?! The only good thing about this movie is Freaking Jim Carrey, look at him, he is having fun with the role!!!!
Is knuckles in the movie? 
More importantly... does he teach others: de wae




Namaste
Dawg with all thats going On im looking forward to dat tails movie spin off
They didn't show Shad's artistic input. Cowards.
Release a bad trailer on purpose? Was this release a ploy to create a fan base to decorate attention???
When I saw Brain on this video I click so fast
Paramount uses Gangster's Paradise for their Sonic trailer




Me: Yeeeeeaah!!! They're fucked.
Creators have to be careful.. there's a football quote that applies to listening to fans: "If you listen to the fans, you'll find yourself sitting with them"".. (aka you'll be unemployed)
It’s not as bad as there making it seem
This movie has so many wrong things..I can’t even imagine how long it will take for them to fix the movie lol
The thing is that even if that blue pube ball does get a redesign the movie might not be good at all so even if the people like me who grew up with the cartoons and the games are getting the design for sonic they want the movie will probably still be shit
Brandon was me in this.
I loveeee youuuuu kelsey
Yall should show them EXTREMEMEME MASHUP
I'm SO worried it's gonna be more something like that live action Woody the Woodpecker movie... 😬
0:20
I agree Brandon!!
Lol the commercal just came up😂
I think they delved into the Uncanny Valley with how sonic looks, which is why people are so against it as well
More ppl are more concerned about the design than the awful flat jokes..I really hope the actual movie is better than what the trailer shows..I'm scared.
I wish they didn't update sonic because I wanted to watch bad sonic movie.
Omg, Faze Rug is on there...OMG I am freaking out..
9:24 this guys is too much 😂😂😂
3:51 that’s cruel this is why I’m not subbed or even know you except from FBE u absolute ** you said a lot of mean things
Kelsey!!!
please do elders or adults react to michael jackson or rolling stones
FBE also lacked information here. The only thing is that Paramount didn't consult (maybe) with the Original Creators of Sonic and studied what design or behavior that should be unlike Detective Pikachu they coordinated and worked with the Original Creators and studied for over a year before going with the final designs. The Creators of Sonic was sad when the trailer got released and retweeted the fan arts design, when Jeff Fowler tweeted that they're going to change Sonic's design the Creator was very happy and Thanked the Fans of Sonic for giving Sonic some love.
They were making it realistic

Brandon lol
Eeeeeeee I love Kelsy,and faze fug, Brandon Roger yasssss
5:50 what toothpaste do you use Sonic
Who else saw Rug and clicked
In a way. I dont believe its fair to compare the genie to sonic in the comparison. Sonic has had so many games and appearances in games with a consistant design known to nearly everyone. But with the Genie, hes only had the single design from the original Aladdin. People might be more accepting of the Genie change due to it being the first ever redesign. But with Sonic. His design has changed in the past from classic to modern sonic and the movie doesnt follow anything from either design except blue hedgehog
They made egg man skinny! He is not skinny. Not at all! Ahh
One of my fav vids
Me: Sonic looks.....okay.....but Jim Carrey is a horrible casting decision and is trying too hard to be funny.
Everyone else: Sonic looks horrible but Jim Carrey could be okay.

Plus, this whole 'people hate it so we're redoing it again to please the public' sets a VERY dangerous precedent
00:20
Can you react to scare tactics

They shoulda made the movie cartoonie
I thought it was a kids show sooo why are all these grown ass men/womenn tripping
sonic can dodge 300 missles but can't dodge a tranquilizer dart? hmmmmm..
Why does everything in live action have tiny eyes??? It's so unsettling to go from a cartoon version with big eyes taking up half a face and then suddenly they're like a third of the size

THE FUCKING SHOES GOD DAMN
My friends and I were discussing this when the trailer first dropped. One of my friends mad a point that we all agreed with. Everyone loved Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the way the cartoons reacted with the normal people. No one asked for a more realistic sonic, They just wanted sonic.
Brandon Rogers is my spirit animal
Y'all are picky as heck. I love Sonic, so I'll see the movie no matter how he looks like. Jim Carrey is in it after all
please react to the new spiderman trailer
i recon teeth are fine but just fix the colour the body shape and the eyes
"furry costume"


Me:.....inhails.....BOI
sonic is truly cursed
Honestly, the trailer had most every detail near perfect, except that ghoul they're calling Sonic. But they're "fixing it" so that should help
SammyClassicSonicFan literally spoke for us in the past. At first everyone thought he was joking and laughed at him. Now? Everyone agrees with him. xD
I think this is a great marketing strategy who knows maybe they didn't even on purpose
Even if sonic's redesign isn't the best I'm still gonna watch the movie
I think that this sonic design looks like a child in a furry costume
Jirard, good to see you!
The sonic trailer doesn't look that bad. People fucking whine too much
tbh the sonic in the trailer looks like thing 1 and thing 2
WHERE AM I?
Yes thanks FBE for my Request 😊😊
Ok, did anyone see, Smurfs, Alvin and the Chipmucks, Garfield, Woody Woodpecker ? How'd those movies do......go ahead I'll wait. Even IF they "made him look right ".  The movie is going to suck. IT IS A FACT.
I think this looks awesome
Am i the only one who thought the guy at the start was Jon Snow
He doesn’t look that bad
The only time audiences change something for real is when they either go or not go to the movies. Their opinions are never taken into consideration. Mark my words, sonic will not change. Social media has never changed anything.
Pause at 0:23 or 0:24 hehehehehehe
i'll go watch it for sure because they actually made the effort and it's been a while since i've seen jim carrey in a role like that.
3:33 Alright Anthony, the joke isn't offensive...let's hold ya horses for a bit fam
Yh it’s not that bad because there aren’t many blue standing hedgehogs, until you put it next to THE blue standing hedgehog

Red shirt guy is an intellectual
Get the faze dude off of react hes irrelevant
The guys who made this movie officially said they’d be redesigning sonic for the final movie and I hope to God they do cause it doesn’t look like Sonic it looks like a really intense fan cosplaying as Sonic! I feel like they should’ve given Sonic the Detective Pikachu treatment where he looks like the games but made his fur and clothes look more realistic!
He looks like a meme
Gangster's Paradise?! In a Sonic Movie??!!!
Yes FazeRug, LaurDiy,Joey Graceffa,  I love them
Faze rug
Faze up
Rug🔥
As bad as the animation looks, I still have to respect the film makers for deciding to listen to actual viewer criticism and deciding to redesign Sonic.  That, to me, at least shows that the creators do care about delivering quality material, and are trying their best to make this film decent.
Why would you ask for the other Sonic's characters in that movie if probably they are going to look frucked up as well; probably the people behind the idea of that redesign of Sonic and who back it up, probably backed up Ben Affleck as Batman as well XD. Jim Carrey is the only win in that trailer.
Brandon is a whole ass mood

Sonic doesn't look that bad, but at least they're changing his look
I’m surprised Padilla didn’t make a skit about this yet

Try not to yawn
absolutely what ive been thinking WHERE IS TAILS
Anyone else hear Fortnite in the background at the end 🤣
that guy in the red was trying to hard to make his words sound so professional
I read it could be a marketing ploy where they used a wack version of Sonic for the trailer to gain attention. But that aside, the movie and gaming industry has become very lazy and just leaches off established franchises. They are messing up so much that people just can't keep quiet anymore and are starved of quality entertainment, that's why people are kinda upset about GOT right now, since this last season has been pretty poor so far compared to the earlier work they did.
what if the design is worse  then what’s in the trailer and what if they make knuckles oh no
I bet Tails isn’t in this I would bet a lot of  money
Yo Jirard made it to FBE!!!

I'm honestly surprised that they didn't do an episode on pewdiepie ending the subscribe to pewdiepie meme
Idk what's wrong but I like it
Is it just me or sonic from the movie in real life looks likes a stuffed animal
Jim saved the whole movie
Frickening Intensifies
There was a live action Sonic video that was their years ago when I was in elementary school and it look more better than that.
" slams table NO MORE TEETH NO MORE TEETH"

Nice
FaZe Rug is in this??? I barely saw him in the video!
The main difference between the sonic movie and the Pokemon movie is very simple. They know their audience. The pikachu movie knows who wants to see Detective Pikachu, and thats older above 20 fans who have a deep love for the game and the infamous pokemon. Realistic is always going to look weird and they embraced that, going for an older audience with darker humor and design. Hell the Pikachu team hired a fanartist that drew realistic pokemon for years as a designer. At face value, Detective Pikachu just looks like it had more love put into it. The designs are sharp, looking realistic but not to much by keeping a carton silhouette. Even the backgrounds are detailed and it looks like a world. Sonic on the other hand has a Sonic that doesnt look like Sonic, looks realistic in the worse place(Eyes and Mouth fucks with people), and honestly just looks barren and out of place. Sonic is the only strange thing in the film, like a style thats been stuck into the wrong frame. Even in the story he clearly doesn't belong there. It feels contrived and without any real reveal of plot he looks like a chilli hotdog that fell from the sky. I think people are overeacting, I mean, how many times has Sonic been thrown into the trash in recent years? Maybe a lot of love was put into this, maybe in context itd feel better, but it just doesnt stick as it stands. A hopeful person would say that it suffers from the same things Aladdins Genie did, which is simple context but as its stands Im worried that even with redesign, its just going to be a bad movie.
The screaming Sonic fan would have some choice words about this trailer
Do college kids react to Lil Uzi vert
Adults react to YouTube rewind but it's actually good
Actual youtubers please
4:36 
She's trying to be supportive
My biggest question is... why "Gangsta's Paradise"? It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, I don't see the correlation...
Redesign reason I’ll go
Jeez Brandon Roger's was so mad 0:20 😅😅
They better have Dr.Eggman saying PINGAS
First World Problems
I had no plans to see this even if Sonic's design is fixed because I can't stand the premise of Sonic being in the real world!  He came from such a colorful world with interesting chars and you're going to put him on Earth?  This is why I didn't watch the one Sonic show that took place on Earth.


CGI in general nowadays just looks bad.  Sad thing is, originally in real life cinema back in the 90s when they started using CGI more, it was originally used to help make settings and objects more realistic when it would be harder to use practical effects.  Perfect example, the other day the original Jurassic Park movie came out and the graphics still hold up to date and they look real!  Now in a lot of movies it's pretty obvious when something was made by a computer.

(fyi.i have nightmares of the irl version)
I just have one thing to say

RIP Sonic
With everybody remaking screen shots, let's replace every frame & fix the trailer.
Detective Pikachu actually looks like an interesting movie with great character designs. Sonic is a generic kids movie with shitty character design
Do kids react to ski mask the slump god 

Like if u agree
They got Jirard so cool
You know, he's right! Sonic has been trying to find his style over the years especially through the conversion of 2d to 3d games, so it make since sonic looks different, still doesn't look good but pikachu looks like pikachu BECAUSE his design really hasn't changed after the 3d phase
Sonic looks like If a third grader made him and I think that the person who posted what he made is better
Hey, remember when Aliens made their prequel and redesigned the creatures? That didn’t work out well also, either . In the words of John Conner “You can’t go around killing iconic characters!!”
This probably will sound like the dumbest idea ever but can we have a try not to react challenge? Like show them the weirdest videos and they just can’t say anything or have different facial expressions. Like wouldn’t it be hard for them since they’re so used to reacting to everything? Idk maybe it’s a dumb idea haha
0:20 The honest reaction to seeing live action Sonic XD
O only clicked this God cuZ of Faze rug
Brandon Rogers had the best reactions
That guy in the red shirt needs to shut the fuck up.
I just realized that Sonic looks like a Who from Whooville or Thing 1 and 2 from The Cat in the Hat
If we’re gonna have a video game movie... make it Rosalina’s movie she’s got my favorite story
BRANDON ROGERSSS
Yes rug
This looks like a good movie but Sonic looks like an anti-vax child on his 2nd birthday
Yes! Faze Rug is finally here!
For me the design of Sonic really isn't that bad. I can cope with it. I think it looks great with the human teeth
I would of preferred an actual hedgehog with red sneakers, white gloves and painted blue over this abomination, at least then it would make sense.
Low key "Try not to get Mad" challenge 😂😂
Yes. This. Is. What. 
WE NEEDED
Edit: I meant Youtubers reacting to it, not the movie. THAT SHIT NEEDS TO BURN
"All the blue people" 
Oh god PLEASE LET LUCARIO BE GOOD AND IN DETECTIVE PIKACHU. PLEEEEEAAAASSSSEEEE!!!!!!
Is Kelsey still single?
Ohhhh its THAT bad. Idk what’s worse between Fortnite and this version of Sonic
I watched many reactors. About half loved it. About half hated it. Of those that loved it, they didn’t care that Sonic looked like it did, though a few said it could be better. The only thing absolutely everyone said was why Gangsta’s Paradise?

It is my opinion that had Sonic looked like classic Sonic, there would have been the same outrage in the opposite direction. They would say it looks too cartoony, why doesn’t it look more realistic considering it’s a live action film.

That said, I feel it should be a little less realistic. Sonic is from another planet, he doesn’t need to look that much like our hedgehogs. Hopefully the design hits the sweet spot in between. There will still be upset people, there always are, but maybe people accept in better.

Oh, and I hope hope hope the story doesn’t suck. This type of movie is usually hit or miss. There’s rarely an in between. Those are just my two cents; your opinion may vary.
Brandon Rodgers is a mood.
The main difference between the Detective Pikachu and Sonic the Hedgehog films is the Pikachu movie was made with the fans in mind. Hence, the Pokemon all kept their original designs, and realism was established through texture. That's why it works. With Sonic, they changed his basic design. He's not supposed to have long human legs, human hands, human teeth, human eyes, etc. HE'S A HEDGEHOG. SONIC THE *HEDGEHOG*. Keeping his design while giving him realistic texture would have been fine, like that person's edit. I hope when they fix it it will actually maintain Sonic's basic design this time around.
if they fail to change sonic’s looks someone should make a video after sonic movie releases called “Sonic The Movie but only Jim Carry” and it would have more views than the actual movie 😂
This is the first time I've seen Brandon freak out outside a skit 😂😂
And you didn't have Arin here for this?
Props to the youtuber "ThatOneVideoGamer" because he made some valid points that most people actually fail to see and consider
Sonic is dead
Rah the completionist! Didn’t expect him!
Me: oooohhhhh it’s dang Matt Smith!!!
I really do think that that a creator is able to do what they want without people's comments, but this isn't a creator thing, Sonic was already created, they redesigned him, but they didn't get what charactheristics make Sonic Sonic. Detective Pikachu did managed that (and I'm not sure about that in Aladdin, but is okay for me), but this isn't a sitiation where the audience controls the creators content, they took a character the audience like and know, redesign him especially for the audience and failed to do something that the audience liked because they.know what the real chatacters look like...just saying

Edit: Also that the movie looked like more like a fusion of Hop/Peter Rabbit kind of movie and a Fast and Furious, instead of a movie with more Sonic's world personality; they should've aimed for an animated movie. (Gangsta's paradise, really? Everyone's uses it EVERYWHERE, c'mon)
Brandon Rogers' comments are everything!
The guy with the blue needs to chill. I’m a huge Sonic fan and even I am not going ham like that.
Grabs popcorn and heads towards the Comment Section
Watch them make it worse
Omg FaZe Rug yesssss I’ve been waiting for him to come on here!!!
0:22 has me dying 😂😂
Jirard is such an angel dude
Whoever watches movies based on rotten tomatoes reviews is an idiot
Who else had the ORIGINAL SEGA GENESIS with SONIC?
Nobody asked for a live action detective pikachu but it was awesome...

0:11 my reaction before watching the trailer

0:20 my reaction after watching the trailer
I really don't think public opinion has influence over a movie that's already been made, the director probably knew it was terrible to begin with and decided to make last second changes.
I just watched this cause faze rug was in it
Why is he wearing melted dentures?!?! XD
Eh. Yeah, Pikachu looks like Pikachu should. But what about all the pokemon that have fur that shouldn't have fur? Jigglypuff just looks wrong.
Please react 2 MOMMY SON 마미손!!! ㅅㅇㅋ Especially his track, 소년점프 SHounen Jump

The reason why they’re making so many  live action movies from cartons it’s because they have no other ideas
Let me know if Jim Carey starts talking from his butt.
Overreaction is an understatement it is not that bad

My friend when his mom takes away his Juul: 
the only reason i'll watch the Sonic movie just because Jim Carrey. and Luckyly, the Director change the Sonic design into the Original ones
Of course Rug doesn't think he's "that bad". They look the same lmao
i personally did not like chris im sure he is a great creator but for a product that is now back in development and not even out i personally feel like he was being to harsh on the film without giving the respect to the creators of that trailer but thats my own opinion
1:13 SAME!!

3:19 ASKING THE SAME QUESTION!!!!
I agreed with dangmattsmith with everything
you can see how among those youtubers, Jirard is the only one that give reasonable criticism when the trailer is shown to them, others just over reacting or simply just don't care...
Dr. Eggman is fine, it feels like watching his past life trying to catch Sonic.
All were asking is to Chang Sonic's design people, I grew up with God Damn Sonic.

It’s bad but people are kinda over reacting

BRANDON ROGERS!!!!!
did anyone notice the naruto run @ 2:49?
They made a horror movie.
7:04 and i don’t necessarily agree with THIS, sonic has never been struggling or will ever be to find his identity, everyone knows how sonic looks like, the eyes aren’t separated, he DEFINITELY doesn’t have human teeth and he has thin arms and legs. thats just common sense to everyone at this point
Chris ❤️❤️❤️😭
I don’t see the problem. I think it looks great
0:20 Thats a MOOD for this Movie
THEY ALREADY FIXED THE EYES
HIS EYES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE ANIMATION, DOES NO ONE SPEAK OF THIS!!!!
Not to be bossy, but anyone who thinks sonic looks fine is wrong. He is way too human it’s disturbing.
What’s the problem with it it’s a cartoon it’s going to be hard making it real
Brandon is a whole mood
Of all the books, comics, and games to adapt, they choose Sonic? Why? Also, why is it so made so childishly? The only fans of sonic who'd want to see the movie are teens and adults who grew up playing the Sonic games or watching those old as fuck cartoons. So it's unsurprising that they're lashing out. You're messing with their nostalgia and that's a powerful and dangerous force.
Whos apart of the Rugrats?
I'm sorry but if I seen that picture with out  any caption or context I think I'd know it was Sonic

I'm sorry but if I seen that picture with out  any caption or context I think I'd know it was Sonic
Should have went with the sonic unleashed cgi
Ok I'll say the negative to Pikachu the main character doesn't look at Pikachu when Pikachu hits him with his tail
React to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (band)
1:05 BE QUIET!!!!!! I love sonic and he needs to have a movie
I feel they went all mad with the sonic movie looking bad compared to the Pikachu movie mostly because Pokemon has been around longer than sonic. But sonic has always had different looks over the years from the different versions of the tv show, to different versions of video games and then the animated cartoon movies that were originally made. so to have pikachu be spot on is because if anyone messed up the pikachu look or any of the characters it would cause a lot of madness with true fans and the creator of the original series
SPEEEEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!!
6:29 ok, I completely disagree with this first of all the design does matter would you rather stare at an adorable yellow mouse or an devilish little blue hedgehog for 2 hours? Also the pikachu plot looks SOOO much better then sonic and the plot is the main part to a movie so saying that supporting detective pikachu means you support sonic is FALSE.
Yay Stevie! I love Stevie. ❤

Someone get Jim Carrey a back brace he's gotta hurt from carrying this movie
I don't get why people are so negative about this. Everyone deserves to make stuff the way they believe to be. No one should be forced to change their creations because of the pressures of society.
Wow
No one asked for this Sega. Grow a pair and tell Paramount they messed up! It never had to get this far!
director looking a cgi sonic..."Meh, thats close enough"
This trailer scared me more than any horror movie ever could.
"How could you not love Jim Carrey?" I mean him being an extreme anti-vaxxer might do it.
So is everyone gonna ignore the fact that Anthony looks like he should be selling cassette tape‘s in front of a car dealership
People probably still not gonna like the Redesign
Great what’s next... live action South Park ( with realism)
kelsey queen 👑
Hay it’s not Sonics fault it’s the directors
Im ten and I think that sonic is disgracing all the adults who were die hard fans as childs in my opinion
Cant wait for them to release it with a fixed Sonic model just to still get a 20% on rotten tomatoes and still tank
5:03 clearly hasn't seen Space Jam or Roger Rabbit
KELSEYYYYYYYYY!!!😍😍

0:19 May God bless your soul I’m laughing so hard rn 😂
I would flip my shit and murder someone if they make a Zelda live action movie.
There is some valid criticism against the Pikachu movie - some of the other Pokemon (like Jigglypuff) look pretty off-putting.
I like the big dude in the red and it’s not that bad and everyone is over reacting
I just realized Kelsey looks like Emma Stone
Jirard Khalil is the most reasonable guy among all of them
6:59 HAHAAAA OMG, and this is why I Stan Brandon Rogers 😂
All they have to do is not make Sonic look like a guy in a fursuit so I'm looking forward to the redesign
Faze rug is a very good YouTuber but not a reactor
Did not expect to see Stevie! Damn hype
having the ability to make the movie that people want can only be good, so them listening to the fans is only a good thing
yes because,  no hedgehog on the planet has teeth.  Also the guy in the gray shirt seems to be off his meds.

It's not JUST the design, it's the execution of the entire thing. The comedy is terrible, it's visually lacking one very level, washed out, dry. The action looks awful and uninspired. The story is garbage and formulaic. There's just no charm to this dumpster fire. You can't make shit like Spiderverse and the LEGO movie and not expect people to want a visual spectacle that also is charming and surprisingly clever. This shit reeks of mediocrity.
5:49 that evil laugh hahah
They yeeted Sonic right into the uncanny valley that's why everyone thinks he looks so fuked up

when u see sonic live
Don't take this the wrong way but when you think of tmnt they don't look anything like they originally did in their live action but it still looked good. The Sonic movie tried to attempt to do that but failed. I'm okay if he looks different from his og character design but... They made a hideous child furry. They should of made him cooler

If they can make a Sonic movie, why don't they make a Legend of Zelda movie?
The Detective Pikachu movie looks like a movie that will still be good. As for the new Sonic movie, it looks like it's not going to take things seriously.
2:00 I agree with him, not that bad.
Saw faze rug and clicked
Sonic the Movie sounds like YouTube Rewind 2018: something that was anticipated to be good is terrible and needs to be changed! The only difference is that the director listened to the fans whereas YouTube is like "meh, I'll still get money"
Faze rug Ayy
Sonic team and paramount done fucked up. Its good that the critism got to them to the point of adjusting the character. If we didnt speak up,imagine them just doing it for the money and not caring for the fans appeal to what makes sonic sonic
“I’m getting too heated.”




Same.
The redesign is pointless if the script doesn’t change. It already looks like it’s gonna suck based on that
Sonic looks like a human

Anthony looks like kit harrington's long lost brother
Thank you, Jirard! This is why I’m a fan of yours!
I bet Legend of Zelda is next.
"Cartoon" they nailed it.
It should have just been an animated movie instead of live action.
Pause at 0:23 trust me
The reason why everyone love  detective Pikachu because the director of that movie actually did their homework. also, they got a good realist artist to draw for pokemon to make'em "almost look real" plus they stay true to the design. As for sonic, it look like they grab human 3d model n turn it into a furry suit moreover, the movie detective Pikachu doesn't seem like a "cash grab" n Ryan Reynolds won't have to carry the movie by itself, after all, pikachu still like pikachu even if it's in live action plus they got the original voice actor for pikachu.

Next is legend of Zelda

Next comes Mario
Some one need to get fired no, alot of people need to get fired
I feel so bad for the animators and the artists who have to fix it (especially if they aren't moving the release date). Y'all are the real heroes here.
yo what the, you got Jirard, Anthony and Kelsey in here?! This going to be a goooodddd episode
The fact that they tried to humanize and make sonic handsome in some type of cosplay way is just wrong. They should have invited 90's gamers superfans to a private screening.
Brandon’s meltdown at the start is a MOOD
11:09 Sorry what? Is he suggesting Rouge's design was for kids?
FAZE RUG 🙌
I have a feeling this whole “wrong design” thing was staged to get the movie attention.
KELSEY!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG ❤️!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was looking forward to this thank you FBE!!!

Why why whyyyyyy this movie and what is with the gangsters paradise (was my first thought when I saw this) jim Carey will be the only hope this movie has but still whyyyyyyyyy lol
Dear FBE, you need to have ANY group of people react to halestorm. They are a great band and they NEED to be recognized.
YAY IT'S CHRIS KLEMENS
Rug got me to click
Anyone who says it’s just a movie isn’t a sonic fan.
Does everyone just forget Sonic is a popular 90's character? And Gangster Paradise is a popular 90's song? 
And no one can make that connection? 

Or that Sonic is actually a cartoon furry. And furries are basically human-like animals. Sooo..

But yeah, main issue was the eyes. Everything else was tolerable.
The only difference between Sonic and detective Pikachu movie. They got someone who is famous for creating Pokemon in real life photos but for Sonic they don't have a famous real life artists in their Studio
it's just a fucking movie, it's not the end of the world!
chris and brandon? fuck me yes pls
Let’s be honest Jim Carrey is the only thing that’s not bad in this movie the rest is hot trash
AND I HOPE THEY HAVE TO PAY SO MUCH FUCKING MONEY TO FIX IT
Jim Carrey is the only reason that I would want to watch the movie

Pikachu is very simple character so that’s why it was better to make so pls stop hating on sonic. sonic is a hard character to design stop hating on it😭
Brandon reaction is most sonic fan reaction right now
Imagine them coming out with a worse sonic
sonic made brandon go crazy HAHA
I only know Anthony Pedilla and Chris Clemens out of these youtubers

Stevie and Kelsey. Now we're talking.
In this specific case, I do think people know best. But in general I think they don't know better than the producers and artists. 
I'm with The Completionist on this, it's a dangerous landscape to walk around in. People shouldn't have too much say in what and how things are being made. We don't always know best even if we think we do. That's how we tend to get hurt in life.
yesss rug 💕
The guy at 0:20 is a man of culture
People are actually liking the genie with the tv spots unlike sonic the only good thing in sonic will be Jim Carrey
Can someone explain why are they so unhappy?
i say if the fans want sonic to be changed again, they would probably trash the movie
0:22 WTF?
4:48 it would be fine like woody the woodpecker it be better than having the hedgehog on the right who looks like the walmart version of the real sonic
Brandon needs to be institutionalised yesterday. He is a threat to everyone and a affront to human decency.
No one really talked about how the story line doesn't really look appealing, especially to those who for so long ago watched some Sonic series, and the fact that we saw no other characters from the games or series is also a big let down. But hopefully they at least include tails in the movie, maybe that'll make it better.😗👌
I'm just thinking ,
the standards gets higher, higher every movie. It's not that bad tho, I think they  really want something of a difference to a really high-end graphics of a sonic game to an actual movie. 
And for the people saying "Who asked for this?" People also did that for the mcu, look at where they are now.  People that owns a wide universe (comics, vid. games, tvshows?) they saw what the MCU is capable for, so they also want to try out the formula, so let's just sit back, give feedbacks that aren't "toxic" and enjoy our generation(s).
1: 13 
bro i was thinking the same thing!
The Completionist, LaurDIY, Brandon Rogers, Anthony Padilla, Faze Rug, Joey Graceffa, and Dangmattsmith are the only ones that matter here. 

Wow, good job on getting more ACTUAL professional Youtubers for once
Whats up with anthony’s hair
Can’t understand the hate. It’s a movie not real life. Sonic looks okay to me, dissecting it like this is a little over the top.
I'm glad the director is going to chance how Sonic looks because this version is gonna give me nightmares. Yikes on this one.
He looks pretty good when he first looks up. ( in the beginning ) His eyes were good but then it wasn’t suddenly. His body is like too tall and too like realistic.
Bruh why you always gotta use irrelevant youtubers most of the times
Not only will it cost more money to redesign him, it'll also push back the release date.


Also, Sonic doesn't have "human" hands. HE HAS TOE BEANS, WHAT HUMAN HAS TOE BEANS?
If Paramount wants people to watch the new movie they shouldn't release the new trailer...they should make people go watch the movie to see what Sonic looks like. 😁
I don’t think it is going to be about sonic I think it’s going to about dr.robotnick turning into dr.eggman
2:13 runforthecube?
How Brandon saw the beginning, was me when I saw it too
HOW DOES SONIC RUN FAST ENOUGH TO STOP EVERYTHING AROUND WHEN DODGING MISSLE AND YET HE GETS HIT BY A STUN GUN!!!!!!
I knew rug was gonna be in a video!!!
My kids will enjoy it but Hollywood has totally destroyed him.
“There wasn’t a need, I don’t remember anyone asking for this.” RIGHT WHO WANTED THIS MONSTROSITY 😭
5:50 DAD WHAT WAS THAT
Sonic is slower than a snail
Did they not have test audiences before going through with the full blown production? I mean how could that many people be working on a movie and not one of them was like "are we sure this is the look we want to go with"? Also, I agree that the trailer song choice was absolutely terrible. How does Gangster's Paradise relate to Sonic in any way? Did they just Google "songs from the 90s" and used the first one on the list?
Blue people? You leave the Na'vi out of this!
If the movie gets good ratings, I'll be surprised.
My reaction 0:00
Ok wtf was that at 0:20?

I lowkey feel like this was done on purpose to get attention from the media
Its not even that bad though
I prefer Sonic X
I’m probably gonna want to see this movie anyway just cause Jim Carey is always hilarious
pls do marvel fans take a marvel test

Would you rather watch the movie with the Sonic as is, or play Sonic Boom? I'm honestly inbetween.

FAZE RUG😂!!!! Finally yess😂
Oka but I kinda think it looks okay 🤷‍♀️
I'm glad that they changed the design of sonic and now I'm hyped about the movie who's with me 🙋‍♂️

Hey it’s Jirard! He’s so underrated & such a cool guy!

I agree whit FazeRug,Sonic doesn't look that bad,I've been waiting since the trailer for someone to agree whit
We'll we got stevie now.
Jim is the only reason I would watch it
Could you imagine they redesign it and they end up just taking the teeth out and making him have no teeth 😂😂
1:09 getting heated what will happen he will scream and lactate rainbows
The thing is they are based on iconic characters with solid fans behind them. As a director, producer, or animator the one thing you must never do is to butcher these characters. You can improve on them, yes, but keep it to a level acceptable and true to the original. It would be fine to create new characters since they are newly introduced and have a chance for people to appreciate them. That is why doing live action movies is quite a risky  venture. If people didn't like it, your millions of cash invested in a movie will just go down the drain. They have to be very careful about this.
Uggghhh.... Why are people hating the design?!
Have you guys ever took a shit and have the water splash on your ass
i exited, but not too much. ALAO ALSO how did u get MATTDANGSMITH to react to this??!?!?!?! im knew to this so....

Please react fancy by twice

I saw faze rug and clicked so fast😂
7:16 I don't totally agree with that, I think the character Sonic has its identity established. The problem here is the Sega company, didn't had vision enough to sustain their history in video games since their boom in the nineties.
Brandon is fucking MEE at the beginning 🤣☠️

Hey this new Five Nights at Freddie's game is looking pretty weird...

Jarrad is the guy who actually knows what he’s talking
Anybody else thing that they already had 2 versions of sonic designs: this one and the good one, just to build hype for the movie?
Jirard was the voice of reason here. Respect +1
KELSEY!!!!!
brandon is literally my spirit animal omg
Where is the outcry over eggman. Since when did he lose much weight?! There must be over 200lbs weight loss!
Sonic looks like a person in a really bad costume. Don’t try to change a good thing
I got a Detective Pikachu commercial during this. Let’s keep it at one, then go to the other.
3:42 so he just had the most beautiful hair you can imagine and now it’s just gone just like that???

Sonic hasn’t been relevant since the early 90’s, and even then, not very. Why does this movie exist?

Is Rogers ok? Wtf
0:20 when you turn in a assignment, but you forgot to put your name.
I wish there was a ' World Of Light ' movie because I'd watch that
I think animated sonic looks fine minus the teeth. What I have issues with is him sounding like an adult man. He's a cute hedgehog he's meant to sound cuter and more animated than that.
RUG FINALLY!!!
The difference between detective Pikachu and sonic is that the Pokémon company kept the design of Pikachu with the realm of the Pokémon world. It’s not like they just drew a real mouse that’s yellow and brown. The people who created sonic’s design tried to bring sonic into the human world and follow human anatomy and physics. From a design standpoint I appreciate the creative liberty, but from a gaming standpoint you shouldn’t be changing someone who is so iconic.
The Uncanny Valley effect strikes again.
2:11 mood
Brandon Rodgers reaction to this is priceless 0:20
Neotheater by ajr!!!
I literally bet they already have the perfect design made for the movie, but instead they use a trash design so they can get a lot of attention.
They finna fix him sooo it dont matter , he really doesnt look that bad!
0:20 When you find out your girlfriend is pregnant
I was fine with the eyes and the body proportions, but they should fix his gloves and teeth that much I'll agree with.
react to Neotheater by AJR
Paramount should've bought pewdiepies drawing for 10,000,000 pounds and used it as the character design
Holy shit Anthony Padilla is still alive! Haven't seen that fool in a hot minute
KELSEY!!!!!!!
honestly just make him look more like the original cartoon version it's not that hard but ok
Also, keep in mind that in the Pikachu movie they had to make dozens of other Pokémon and all of them look great. They took two years to design all of the Pokémon, Sonic was the easier task, and they failed. So we have every right to be upset about the design of him. There is no comparison.
The first mistake is them making the movie
WHY TORTURE US, WHHHYYYY
Lol Brandon you beast
NO MORE TEETH
NO MORE TEETH
NO MORE TEETH
0:20 yea that was me when i saw this. . . .
Redesigning Sonic was a mistake right off the bat but actually I don't think it is so bad, the one thing that do bug me a little it's that because he looks more like a human it looks like I am seeing a naked kid running on the street xDDD
Brandon in the start 😂😂😂
I love Brandon Rogers
What the hell was that Brandon Rogers?
And this is why I love Jirard so much.

In Protest of article 13 everyone Spam meme review in the comments
There are right about two things:

2. There gonna have to spend a lot of money and time to redo sonic to look like how he did originally.

REACT TO BAD GUY BY BILLIE EILISH
Sure Sonic looked unsettling, but now those poor animators will have to work at a crunch time pace to fix him. The animators are the true victims here
Reshape eyes a little, legs a little shorter with slightly bigger hands & feet would fix a lot. Teeth are a little weird, but with the other fixes, I'd deal with it. Not sure how I feel about Jim Carrey as Robitnik. It looks like Jim Carrey playing the same character over & over. But other than being skinny instead of rolly polly, he's not per se the worst choice either.
Nies movie
People whine too much
4:49 I'm gonna have to disagree with you there, Jirard. The Looney Tunes movies pulled that off and everyone loved it.
Good job Anthony! You're getting noticed
Stevie Levine is out of touch. Jesus.

OMG Chris Klemens YAYYY ❤
cmon Joey really, nobody asked for Detective Pikachu either and we got that!

Have youtubers react to the music video for Good Guy Shoes
Thank god they are fixing it I respect the director and others working with this movie are prepared to make changes if their is a problem unlike every other movie in Hollywood
Whatever happened to good ideas in Hollywood?
The youtubers who cared enough to complain should care enough to watch it
When you take an iconic character and screw him up as if you were on some sort of drugs, it's mandatory that people should speak up and the producers should change it, just look at Spyro in that spin off BS game.... Whoever gave Sonic the green pass is a mongoltard..
Whenever I hear Gangster's Paradise, like in this trailer, I think of that one AFN PSA with the talking styrofoam cups.

00:21 everyone when seeing soniv
Thank you for bringing Laurdiy back! Alex Wassabi next?
Y'know, as bad as the sonic is I gotta give respect to the producers, director, and studio, respecting the public's opinion and fixing the problem. Wish that had been highlighted more because all to often Hollywood doesnt listen to us and just goes on with the trash. Huge step here but, it was ignored.
Mom: Wake up for school!!


Me: 0:20
MATPAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE REACTING TO THIS!! It’s literally perfect for him. 

Edit: LOL FOUND OUT EVEN THE CO CREATOR OF SONIC DIDNT LIKE THE SONIC DESIGN!

They should have shown the shadman version
If you're a rug fan like
Anyone here cause fazerug??
Hi.
I feel bad for the sonic fan who screams
0:20 Dude chill the hell out. The trailer just began. O_O'
Honestly, they should have just went with the Sonic Boom desigin. It would have been a lot better. And it is true. Hollywood just takes a random property, like, Sonic and just make the plot so stupid and cliche just to make it appeal for kids. Like "Oh a random creature is in the area. Let's bring the military in this."( Though that's kinda fine since the military is involved in the Sonic games like SA/SA2. I think? Correct me if I'm wrong) But still. It all looks generic and eh. But I really hope they consider changing the story a bit when they do the redesign. It probably won't happen, but who knows. And Gangsters Paradise? Really? Out of all the songs they could have chosen, from the GAMES!
Pikachu works with realistic art because Pokémon are considered a species within the Pokémon universe whereas Sonic doesn’t work because he’s literally a blue hedge hog with the powers of the flash, a pair of gloves, and some running shoes. There’s really no realism there. Also gangsters paradise would work better for shadow.

C'mon, Jirard.... we know the sonic part of Sega does not give a fuck. They just want their money.


Between how they treated sonic 06, sonic boom, and how they pre-planned to fire the teams behind of both early (before it failed...), shoved both games out well before it was ready, just to meet a truely stupid and arbitrary deadline for the sake of Christmas kid money.... they don't care, Jared. You know they don't. 

You  they don't.
I know my opinions are weird but that’s just me. Thanks for having me guys! Was an honor to be on YouTubers react.

That dude talking about the creator and the audience was like dead wrong. That idea isn’t valid when you’re creating solely for the audiences pleasure VS creating for yourself.

Omg yessss Brian my habibi 🥺💖
Good that they're going to fix the design but let's be honest this movie is still going to suck.
I AM SPEED
Sonic looks like one of the thing one and two twins from Mike myers cat in the hat, if he was injected by the same serum that turn Hank McCoy into Beast from Xmen first class.
holy shit you can tell this hurt brandon on a very personal level
Omg! It’s Anthony from Smosh!!!
I mean Joey, Detective Pikachu is also a movie we weren't expecting lol
Hi
...AAAAAAAAAH-
Anthony has something in his ass or something
why cant he dodge a slow tranq dart should be the first question everyone ask and you should not be allowed to continue the trailer until it is answered.
Rug!!!!!!!
Hello everyone
8:40 the creator can't create something that has already been created. If they wanted to make something like this they don't need to call it sonic, had they actually stuck to the original look there would less of an outrage.
I wish they left sonic a cartoon I did hear they were fixing it after us memeing
OH MY GOD ITS A MOVIE, GET OVER IT
Actually bless Jirard, fighting the ever-scaling uphill battle in defense of Sonic. With good points to attempt to defend it with.
It's still trash-looking, but Jirard did his absolute best and I respect the hell out of it.
"It is dangerous for the filthy rich producers of a product to listen to the customer." This is why we have things like Tencent and Electronic Arts, Khalil. This is why anti-consumer practices and companies dominate the market. Sentiments like that. For shame. 

A victory for the consumer is a victory. Full stop.
Why the heck do they need to make all classic games and cartoons live-actions
In Detective Pikachu, we have an established storyline that leaves us curious and guessing, while keeping all of the animated characters looking like their originals. 
Sonic just has a chase scene with a little bit of villainary humor, and completely scrapping multiple loved characters, while also not keeping the original design of the character nor establishing any personalities to the characters we are given except for Eggman. 
So let’s hope the story is better than the trailer.
Like, even Frozen 2’s trailer has more plot to it than Sonic’s. We need to be given an idea about what’s happening.
I cried seeing sonic
yo I can't wait for the minecraft movie
For me its simple: If you want to milk an iconic franchise, listen to the fans, learn the material and try to make it great and accurate. You will get the easily impressed kids AND the fans into the movie. And all it takes is preperation before spending money on stupid ideas.
Better yet, get yourselves hardcore fans of said franchise in a lead position. Noone passionate about their hobbies will take decisions lightly. There would be a lot more great movies, if studios got more into it themselves. Ever seen BTS from Marvel Movies? those guys are waaaay into it, and it shows in box office
React to ozuna please

Sonic is iconic for gaming history and all the TV shows I saw as a kid from sonic underground to sonic X. He is an iconic figure and the disrespect of the animation they shoved onto that avatar that was supposed to be sonic was gross.. Detective pikachu however looks lit
Beardy guy is too verbose. It's not that complicated. The viewer is the consumer, and Paramount has a responsibility to their audience, and their business interests, to match consumer expectations. If the populous hates it, changing it only makes sense.
I wanna see how Kids react to this trailer
Totally agree with the guy in red, almost everyone else in the video is like "I demand they change it, but I won't see it anyways"

Hi faz rug
Pokemon does a great job with their video games. There is always so much hype every time a new game comes out. When was the last time you heard a bunch of hype and positive opinions about a Sonic the Hedgehog game?
This movie's gonna suck! Just like Detective Pikachu!
Oh look, Jim Carrey being Jim Carrey. Yawn.

0:19 Dude just acted like his fucking family got shot right in front of him.
Wait the real sonic is with peck and in the new movie have's white aaaaaaaaaa i hate it
I couldn't look at the trailer another time, so I just listened. I'm a Sonic fan and it hurt me inside, outside, and through my very SOUL at what they did to poor Sonic! XD I heard that the studio did this as a stunt...but I think that was a guess. If they finish his design up quickly, maybe it was a stunt. o_O
Sonic looked better in wreck it ralph. take the people who created wreck it ralph and you got a decent sonic movie rated e for everyone.
Sonic looks like the 90’s jumanji movie where the kid turns into a monkey wtf?

Why the fuck is rug in this?
It's like Sonic became a Dr. Seuss character....at least that what the design reminds me of. Nothing wrong with Dr. Seuss just that on Sonic it looks weird...the legs >.<
Brandon's reaction at the beginning is how I felt on the inside 😂 alongside a great deal of fear coz I was fucking freaked out when I saw the live action design animated in this trailer.

Really don't know how I feel about creating in this kind of world. Important to keep the pulse of the audience but this makes it harder to try something really different that, at first may seem like too much change, but on completion might surprise us.

You know what strikes me most?  The fact that GUN is being replaced by the US Armed Forces.  Just shows that they really aren't making a film about the Sonic world and instead going the shitty live action isekai route.  It's terrible.

At least gangster paradise is gonna get more views..

If this movie came to the big screen Jim carrey career is over lol I mean, just the trailer alone gave him some harsh backslash also, Jim carrey gonna have to carry this movie if the new redesign didnt please the audiences again.

I honestly dont think sonis is gonna be good
Lets see sonic fans... they screw up the .... EYES... sonic doesnt have HAIRY ARMS..... no GLOVES.... just WHY
Fuck off These dudes make me so aggressive
They shouldn't put out any new trailers for the sonic movie so that the only way to see the new design is to go see it. Yes, people would spoil it anyway, but that would maybe make enough curiosity to get more people into the theater opening night. Just an idea
I love that Kelsey is in this she's such a YouTuber

THANK YOU CHRIS CLEMENS. Not everything needs a live action movie, cartoons can do so much more in movies, but no live action for some reason is seen as better even though it is infinitely more limited.

The Sonic Movie is in no way a piece of art, it's a money grab. And that's okay! That being said, movies like this only work if they have audiences support, so the studio should definitely change it in order to please the people who want to see this movie. If studios want to make "art" then don't rely on nostalgic characters to reel in the viewership.
🤔
This says allot about Sega and Paramount. Disney took our criticism and politely told us to F off when it came to Star Wars.
react to this year's met gala best outfits please
Anthony come back to SMOSH PLZ
Likr this comment if ur subbed to brandom rogers
This is just like the Aladdin movie. . (Maximum disappointment)
I hope they know they are redesigning him
Sega must not have had there hand in it all too much if sonic came out looking like that
I think Jirard has a point when it comes to fans changing or having control of movies, but I think that this kind of situation is different. Sonic is an established character with an established design and fanbase and the company screwed it up big time. And honestly, the industry is about two things: passion and money. You can just see from the design no one has passion for the project, so it's about money, and they were going to lose a LOT of money if they kept that design and didn't change it. Especially when there's Detective Pikachu as a comparison where not just Pikachu, but most of the Pokemon we've seen in the trailers look both accurate and real and it's amazing. And Pokemon have all sorts of weird shapes and textures. Sonic comparatively has a very basic design and should have actual hedgehog texture. The weirdest thing about Sonic is that his eyes are sort of connected, and that's one thing I think people would be okay with being changed. It ain't that hard to get right.
Sonic is like Michael Bays night turtles everyone hated the new turtle then people got used to it that is what needs to happen with sonic
0:22 this was me when I saw the trailer for the Sonic movie and then realized that I just wasted precious time of life XD
As far as I'm concerned Sonic gets a 5 out of 5 stars just for the action alone. On top of that Jim Carrey is Doctor Robotnik.
recognized faze rug fast
Ew DA teeth and DA LEGS!
The guy who talked about how Pikachu only looks that good because Pokemon and Nintendo have a standard, is pretty strange. Are they trying to say that Sega doesn't have a standard?
Nobody:

Sonic: 👁️👁️hehe

I was like “wow... so.. scary..?”







But when the Billie Ellish songs I’m like “o... halp..... “ but I thought about Ariana Grande’s songs and forgot about this
I found myself dancing in the Sucker part.

Bruh, Katrina Billie’s Songs are OF COURSE dark she is suicidal if Katrina doesn’t know, and seriously Billie likes bury a friend out of all of her songs she made! And it’s probably just photoshopped, and people that like Billie Eilish’s songs are probably suicidal also
The snakes fine bugs no
Gabe your wierd
Me:yay it is Billie Eilish someone random:why do you wanna end you me again:uhhh... IT IS A SONG YOU DUMMY
Who is with Authy Bonita #BillieEilish

You should do this again but do a video that looks like it might have a jump scare but it doesn’t.
So you could see who moves before it looks like there will be a jump scare.
Good kids...maybe....
Noelle has my heart shes so adorableeee 😭😭♥️♥️♥️
Until down isnt scary
I watch bear grylls
HOLY MOTHA F-ING GOSH!!!!! BILLIE!!!!!!!!!!! DEAR GOD
I literally almost threw up on the first one
I will never see that one lion king scene the same again
katrina says billie ellish
EILISH EILISH EILISH LIKE AN EYELASH BUT AN EILISH
They don’t know what until dawn is...
I’m watching this at midnight
Omg one of the girls has the same name as me
Noelle is so cool 👌
I have zero movement so yeah I think
Billie Eilish songs are just composed of her whispering into a fucking mic with heavy bass directed towards edgy teens who self-diagnose themselves with depression and think they are fucking Joker while in reality, they can't order starbucks without the mobile app because they are too fucking scared to talk
Did anyone notice that gabe was wearing a metallica shirt
The first one made me spit out my gum
I honestly would be fine with the snakes just not the bugs 

Me too gurl, me too
I’m with Katrina billies songs are too dark for me
The twins that didnt move made me laugh lmao
Kinda disappointed that none of these kids know what Until Dawn is, but their kids, can't really expect much from em'
If you play a Billie Ellis won't I'm gonna throw up...

hi
Love the video
Your channel should be called FBI
It’s more like try not to be scard challenge
I like how most of the kids noped out of the until dawn vids. I would honestly do the same if I was in their shoes lol
0:14
“Is it try not to get scared?”
“It’s not it’s try not to move”
“Thank God”
....that’s the same thing though
What is FBE favorite meme? 

Go down if your ready :3








FBI OPEN UP
i played with them, i won, because the jump scares didn't do anything
0:39 That’s what she said
I did not flinch ever
Subscribe if i get 10k subs I will donate to charity
Of course Until Dawn was going to be fearful to these kiddos, it gave me nightmares for weeks.
Omg I have a pen pal named Noelle please ask her if she has a pen pal named Czytra
The first one was just gross xD
Yey Billie Eilish :D
And at 1:21
Just look at the sister, is she frozen or something? lol
Ewww just the first video
noelle is seriously the cutest
Billie eLhish
Yay I know that billie eilish song! (Called bury a friend)
OMG me and Janelle have the same shirt
That was easy
I particaptied cuz I'm 9 and I didn't really get scared at the jumpscares but I get really scared at scary games and movies maybe because the screen is smaller or something idk
01:33 wait what ?!!!

You guys shouldn't be showing little kids horror games and Billie Eilish. Like come on some of those kids looked like they were 7 years old. 7 and 6 year olds shouldn't be seeing horror games and Billie Eilish. Its going to give them nightmares.
The bug is BIG CHUNGUS sized
Hmmm Billie Eilish? 




I click
I'm a simple gal, I see Billie, 
19 MILLION!!!!!!!!
Who’s okay with snakes but out of the bug version

the girl who was like: ,,If it would be a Billie Eilish song I would dance and jam all overrrr cause I know all of her songs🤠" would probably be me lmfao
I love Billie Eillsh

Me: hold my phone filled with billie eilish songs

BILLIE IS MY STRANGE ADDICTION !!!!!!! I LOVE HER SO MUCHHHHHH !!!!! 😢😢😢❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😍😍😍😗😗😗😗😗⛅⛅⛅⛅
I won every round this was so easy
It ain't That Dark 🙄 She's half emo
I didnt move
I was eating 🍦 and the first one I almost 🤮
I danced at sucker #jonasbrother
Jenna’s scream is-
omg dont believe me if you dont want to but i dident move but when you put billie eilish i was as fast as lightning singing and danceing xD also at the last part i would ask if the challange was not to move and if they said "not this part just go to the middle real quick" and i lost from moving.
i would jump out a window saying that they LIED
Not really what we on about but wtf is wrong with bear grills
I didn't even move lol
All jakes reaction are so funny
Lol that’s soo funny
billie eilish got me dancin
Did he say elish
Her songs are so dark
Me: *OFFENDED*BILLIE HAS---
2000 Years later
And THATS HOW BILLIE MAKES SONGS.
Was the scary ones resident evil? The video game ones
lol Jenna's The best cuz She requested for Billie Eilish lol She ROCKS!!




BUT HATE THOSE HATERS!!!
anyone hate the girl who does not like billie
lol i won!!!!! if i was there i would not move once
If they played "Bad Guy", I would've easily lost.
I didn't move at all for some reason...
Probably because I saw movies way scarier than that or because the little screen on the top right corner was small...
EWWWW
First video 

Australia 100🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
omg noelle is so cute aahha
😂😂😂😂😂
I saw payton dancing
YEAH Fear FActor!!!!!
Who else almost throw up
Dang it i moved during bury a friend... only billie eilish fans understand....
These  children are not Billie eilish fans,I get it,they’re normal but that girl in the pink tho,that is me
wants to grab a chip from the bag isn't allowed to move FRICK dis IMA MOVEEEEEE!
5:18
me: why is everyone screeming nothings scary
I’m pretty sure until dawn is rated m17+  for a reason.
It just an owl，no I don't get it，What scary
I would have passed the whole thing
Why is this so easy tho?
I love jumpscare
Oh boy here we go again. FBE doing something they should not. that game with all the jumpscares is way above the age limit of these kids. no wonder they take off their headsets even before the scares comes... it obviously scares them :(
That girl said BILLIE OLISH😟😟🤬
I made it through every one
in fear factor and someone says "get me out of here' its my biggest pet peeve GET THE DAMN PERSON OUT! I DONT WANT tO HEAR THEM Complaining AUWJHBE DGW
i love it. the middle person who wanted this and got saw. was called gacha girl,
GACHA LIKE THE GAME? xD
I was doing it too but when they played Billie Elisha that’s when I moved her songs are just too good
”it’s big chungus size” why is that me
To kids react to the clash
Lmao yas girl Billie eilish yass
noelle is so cute
Is it just me that realized that four of the clips were from Until Dawn?
I think i͟t͟ might eat h͟i͟m͟
Shouldn't it be the other way around :/
How do I get on this show XD

That Tida girl has got some balls, nobody else watched ALL of the “jump scare” videos 👏🏽👏🏽
I'd be in a daze with billie Eilish

The little girl : Billie ellish
Me: ITS BILLIE EILISH NOT ELLISH LIKE EYE-LISH
Disgustang!
She’s too dark......
6:24 no no no no not again!!!
Every kid lost to until dawn it’s not really scary.
They legit can’t stand a bit of eerie music... it’s kinda pathetic.
Why is jake scared?!?! Hes a big boy😂😂
Voimits

I forget everything that's why
None of them made me move 😊😂
Lol I am legit just like Jake!🤣

EILISH NOT ELISH
billie is so easy to love aaaahhhh😍
8:30 my friends are obsessed with Billie Elish
Omg "sucker for you" was too difficult!😵😓😍
who else didn’t move or did no sound in  any of them? ._.
I watch the injection in tha back
noelle is so cuteee uwu
I didn’t nudge.
I played Until Dawn, and at that scene, my volume was all the way up, and I screamed and flinched so hard that I almost most had a a heart attack.
How else didn’t move at the jump scares
I couldn’t even survive the first one
Its until dawn my favorite game!😆😁
When I seen Billie Eilish I was like 
"AHHHHH" and my parents heard me from the other room they asked me if I was ok😂😂😂😂😂😂 i love her so much
It was a bird that got a lot of them...
I’m still confuse if Gabe isa girl or a boy
Why no child wants to see the "Until Dawn" part? I'm eleven and since I was nine I liked that game
me when I see Billie eilish

Screams
AHHHHhhhHHHH I LOVE HER SO MUCH
8:30 excuse u it’s Billie eilish and I can’t deal with you rn I’m srry
Why are these children scared of Billie Eilish? Hmm..
Why are y’all torchering 6 year olds just for your job I don’t find that funny or appropriate
I won but on the scary ones i moved my phone back away from me but that doesn't count because I wasn't reacting to the video. And the scary ones were easy I just planked out for that part of the video.
I actually Didnt get scared And suprisingly Im Younger than a Ten year old But WHAT R THEY SCARED OF, YOU KNOW THERE JUMPSCARES... or am i really dead inside
I'd be so good at this. I never moved once
Tida has seen some ish😭
This was easy since I've played Until Dawn so many times and I don't listen to Billie Elish and I don't enjoy dancing at all and I don't listen to people meaning I won't move my chair
Its big chungus sized






LMAO
1:33 that kid is not human

I failed the first one oh my god I nearly got sick but watching Gabe just “nope” out of those situations made it better cuz he was like “nope I ain’t doin this find someone else to do it” then for the final trick if I was one of those kids I would’ve said “Touché”

Ok, I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEE HORROR MOVIES. what the heck. I have seen, lights out, escape room, the ring, the ring 2, the ring 3, IT, the conjuring, the conjuring 2, the nun, and others that I cant remember. They all freaked out during it. Its not even scary xd. I REALLY WANT TO SEE PET CEMETARY. is it good?
8:39 She’s like one of them14 yr olds that tries to be edgy and is over dramatic in Billie Eilish songs.



No hate tho.

So much until dawn XD That game is a scare fr sure tho XD
If I was there, my position would be me covering my eyes, but if they play Billie Eilish I would listen and not cover my eyes and then watch.
If I was in the REACT channel and if they said Try Not To Move or Try Not To Get Scared and if they put Why You Never Became A Dancer I would immedietly not win because  I'm so scared of that...
Noelle was so adorable
These kids thooo be mad cute 😩❤

2-watch the the other parts 
3-watch every moment
4-look for the details
5–repeat
Ps:how are these scary?!
Edit:it can be other films and games
That girl is going to get attacked by the billie fans cuz she called her Elish instead of eilish
" Oh that look delicious.."

HAAA Reangan moved!!! wait noo i mean Payton did!! oh wait what....
Sorry guys but in my opinion you can't show those games with jump scares to kids.
The 2nd one is so dumb how is it scary
I love how Jake already gives up on scary things. it's so funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
little girl - i would honestly be fine with the snakes just not the bugs.
david dobrik - sorry what was that?
Noelle is so cute
Did I heard “Billie Eilish”??
Poor fucking kids
woman : let me out, please hurry!
Noelle : I knows she gonna die
me : HAHAHAHAHA!!
tide won
Where's billie eilish?
Why does people loss when there is already 1 strike, thats not fair, all lost
Honestly the newer kids they have here (Ethan, Leo, Noelle, the twins) are some of the best they've ever had already. Jeanelle could be a bit more natural, but I really like the others.

I feel bad for them about the Until dawn clips and for tricking them at the end DDD:
NOELLE IS SO FRIGGIN CUTE I CANNOT
Every single one of them just being like "nope" with Until Dawn is great.

I like the new kids.
I see billie eilish I click.
Who else does these challenges while you watch their videos? 😂 i do
The new kids were so cute like wtf??
Omg Noelle is soooo cute~
My friend : 8:28


Me : 2:31
I didn’t move to any of the videos except sucker, I lost it when that song played. When Billie ellish played I wanted to move really bad but I didn’t, the game jump scares didn’t get me, I’m a girl not like you care, I play games a lot like resident evil, walking dead and other scary games but those jump scares don’t get me, if it’s real people I do flinch a little bit but I don’t scream, like my MOM, jeez when we’re watching a horror movie she screams at the top of her lungs, one time I was just painting my nail peacefully while mom and dad was watching a horror movie, suddenly my mom screams like she seen a ghost in real life and I got so shocked i literally started crying 
Btw I LOVE horror movies but if something scary happen in real life, like when the door suddenly shut or something like that I’ll be like 
Me: hellll nawhhh •calls mom or dad ASAP• me: hi dad/mom — dad or mom: okay bye ||| me: WAIT, DONT YOU DARE HANG UP. If mom or dad is with me but in a different room I’ll literally be at the room where my mom or dad is in a blink of a eye
(I’m 11years old, like a said earlier not like you care but)
You are all secretly evil aren't you?  Well maybe not so secret.
That one kid singing on bury a friend literally me
You should do the try not to scream challenge

Give them a try not to laugh with mental Mitch
"I'm moviely like a wooooorm" so adorable
I saw every jump scare and did nothing, not even blink
Everyone looked great, but Noelle just slew it. That is one super cute little girl.
Janelle is so adorable🤗☺️☺️
big chungus size 😂
the last one was just plain mean........ just sayin
I love Billie..but it's unsettling to see children sing along to her music
I think the lil girl that was bragging about knowing all of billie's songs doesnt really know what their about and just listens to them because other people do
8:40

Show MK11 Fatalities to them!
React to Linkin Park!

`` Thats a big chungus size thing ``
Noelle is adorable :’)
Gabe is my spirit animal

The girl that said I know all of billies songs  
Was like so braggy she lietarally just stressed me and I mean she probably doesent
I was drinking milktea andbi spit it outbon the first one ffff
I know shes going to die!😂😂😂
When that lil girl said she didnt like billie


I was about to throw hands with her even though i am older
The reason I would move to Billie Eilish was because I would be dancing.
why were all  the jumpscares from "until dawn" you could've found kid friendly movies with jumpscares
Not to be mean i promise pls no hate, but in a jokingly way

Billlllllllliiiiieeee, do a kid reaction
B I G C H U N G U S S I Z E
I’ve played until dawn way too many times to get scared by those jump scares anymore
We're all gonna ignore that Jenna's inner demons came out on the jumpscares lol😂😂😂😂

I would win. I love until dawn and know everything about it! lol.
6 year kid aww

Who else came here bcos they saw it said Billie Eilish......oh ok just me ooof
I iust feel bad about the maggot
The 11 year old screams like a banshee and the 6 year old just tilts her head to the jumpscare 😂😂😂😂😂
That reaction 2:30
Noelle!!!!!! 💖
WHYYYYYY SAY IT RIGHT 8:29
All the kids on the jump scares, bless all their precious hearts they were adorable
Teacher: It’s time for your pop quiz 

*Me inside my head*:2:31
I'm offended Billie is here. That means Billie is scary?! Shes the best.
Noelle is so ADORABLEEEEEE
Kudos to those kids- I'm in highschool and i literally screamed when i saw that maggot video
0:24 uh um I’m very mOoVaLy I’m like a worm
When I saw that raccoon part in until dawn (before it happened) I knew all of them would get scared or move( I have beaten until dawn )
then there’s me, a 12 year old who’s involved in gang shoot outs.
I see Billie Ellish, I click.
Me while watching the video: 😐😐
puts chip in mouth
😐😐
Most of these are from until dawn that’s really graphic
Oh my god the way that girl said eillish is triggering me so much!!!
I loved this one there were 2 grand slams
So I’m younger than some of the kids. None of the videos made me move (the last one didn’t count for me) (also I know some of you don’t care but eh)
Tida is who I aspire to be lol
I didn’t move lol
That first one almost made me puke ESPECIALLY since it kept replaying for us 😅☠💀🤒
Noelle is adorable
Janelle is  like the sweetest most  innocent bean.
Man, if that’s Jenna’s reaction to the bird, I’d hate to hear how loud she’d get over the wendigo.
college kids react to supernatural ending
Is Gabe a boy or girl
The “animated” one is actually a game called by deadlight
So much UNTIL DAWN! I LOVE IT
1:00 "it's big chungus size"
Well that sure was dumb.
Leo and Noelle are both cute! They tried really hard.
The first video was from Netflix
Devil sign at 11:28
10:06 is that sans?
These 6 year olds are more descriptive and wise then my 6 year old siblings🤣
i hate watching these kids video cuz it makes me jealous how lucky they are to have a happy life and not have depression or anxiety or suicidal thoughts or anything like that
I'm so happy they showed the Bear Grylls one😂
Noelle is so fricken adorable
Let's just pretend that I said something funny.
8:29 BiLliE eLLiSh
I played along and passed all 😀
How do you get top comment I need answers I'm dumb
The twins are very different from each other( personality).
Bruh until dawn has to many plotwists
How come when i go to videos with JUST A SINGLE SECOND VISIBLE CHILD the comments get disabled while this isnt??
I just came here for the Jonas Brothers, tbh
noelle and the twins are my fav
I know there kids but I wanna curse out the ones that didn't like Billie it's just a reflex lol I'mma do it anyway 1not all here songs are to dark2. She isn't that scary or creepy in real life 😂
I would have moved my chair too 😂
8:30 its eyelish not ilish eyelish get  it right
yyyassss finally the kids react to billie eilish
billie eilish is stupid and gets way too much fuckin money
Noelle is so cute. ❤❤❤
yo why are all the comments from 10 minutes ago
Noelle is so adorable
WTF! MAN I WAS EATING
Well done to Tida and Payton.
Can make the teens play deltarune
This is bille eilish's fan base. A bunch of 8 and 12 year olds.
Lmao it’s big Chungus sized
Make the jump scares full screen so they scare us not just the 5 year olds.
I’m just board so I want to scroll through the  comments that’s why I move
It's big chungus size
- this kid
I hate when kids fucking like Billie Eilish it pisses me off, lmao I hate children
6:43 
“i know she’s gonna die”
Their parents are so irresponsible because it’s normal that kids get to have phone & social media they think their teenagers but their not their not likable
I moved because I was laughing at the kids reaction.
noelle warms my heart she’s so cute 💖
The first one (Bear Grylls) is famous in Great Britain. A friend of mine knew him growing up.
Thought gabe was a girl
all of them got scared on the jumpscares and i didnt move at all    i thought the bird one was funny
That last one was effed up
Why all the until dawn stuffs?
:24 I’m very movily like a worm
0:24*
3:01 I'm pretty sure Luke (if thats his name) did the whole crime.
Can you really not find any jumpscares that aren’t until dawn
Noelle is adorable ❤️❤️😂
I had no emotion in any of them, 






I think I’m a sociopath
They don’t know what until dawn is???
omg they're adorable!
Kid:I never move my body I move my leg
Me:that is your body
Hmmmmmmmm i thought we weren’t allowed to make comments underneath videos with kids in them SUSAN EXPLAIN!
I mean you really shouldn’t be showing kids that Billie Eilish video
I won
2:56 the jumpscare didn't get him, it was the bird.
The three year beat them wtf
Lmao they aren’t even old enough to remember The Jonas Brothers
Omg!!! That girls name was reaghan too!!!! I’m happy inside☺️
Kids react to Billie eilish pls
Until dawn... not for kids
The only way to win is




To look at the Conner of the computer

Me (a horror movie fan) being shocked throughout the WHOLE VIDEO cuz these kids get scared while back here, i’m not being scared at ALL
Noelle is so adorable
UNTIL DAWN.

BILLIE EILISH. 

I LOVE THEM BOTH.
You should put a rick roll for a jumpscare
Me when activation says they're going to make a Call of Duty Advanced Warfare 2 2:31

Noelle: I don't play games that include dying.
Me: Well, obviously you can't-
Oh that Looks Delicious
Bruh the scary ones aren't even scary and the kids are like ahhh (I am a similar age btw)
Eilish is overrated
Me:didn’t move
Ewww the first one 🤢

Dear lord, these kids are scaredy-cats
When the dude ate it and Stuff came out I ran to the bathroom and barfed
I would love to see you guys do that lemon challenge...

WHERES MY BILLIE AND AVOCADOS (even tho she changed her user) FAM!?!!! Me!!
You should’ve gotten actual scary clips from that game. Those were the not bad jump scenes
I love Gabe and his comments so much. "looks delicious" I havent laughed that hard in a while
these new six year olds are so cute
Where's the kid with the eyebrows

None of the “Scary Clips” were bad. It’s not that hard you look at it and think of something else
ItS BiG cHuNgUs SiZe
Leo and Noelle are adorable
1:34 "awh, that looks delicious"
2:52 when you see your mom whooping your brother

BILLIE EILISH? WHAT DOES SHE HAVE TO DO WITH THAT?!?!?
7:32





Just noticed he has a metalica shirt
I’m sick and I’m watching this and yes I’m stupid
That little girl Noelle is so well spoken, polite and adorable!! She needs to become a Kids React regular.
Where can I get the jump scare gamr at
I'm ok with watching this
As someone that's watched Before Dawn so many times the Jumpscares didn't get me 😂
2:32






When the roach has wings

Noelle is adorable af
None of these kiddos should know Billie Eillish's music tbh. They're all like ten and younger.
"It's......Big Chungus sized"

8:28 if your gonna hate on Billie eillish at least say her name right I'm just saying so don't come for me
Ive played until dawn its a really good game
Honestly the animated ones didn’t scare me I just sat there 😂
The one with the bird wasn't scary at all it was funny
the first clip literally made me gag
I literally threw on the first one 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Horror games are my life
Those videos were suppose to be scary?
Who’s Billie eilish
PLZ DO A TRY NOT TO GET SATISFIED WITH KIDS
Plus I’m guessing the first clip was from man vs wild
Gabe is the cutest
Leo did not move
Anyone realize that all of them blink and they were not allowed to close their eyes
Yes!!!!!!!! Billie Eilish!!!!! I didnt move at all.
8:28  billie olish
None of them made me move because I already know about until dawn and Billie
i see billie i click
The jumpscares weren’t that scary
JESUS 2:30
2:31 I’ve never heard someone scream like that except for in movies
Billie Eyelash
2:30 Tom and Jerry stuff right there
Try not to smile try not to smile try not to smile try not to smile
Try not to smile
Try not to smile
Try not to smile please
Im just happy they are fair with the kids, and don't make them do anything they dont want to.  Some of these channels that involve kids are not like that
Why is nobody talking about how cute Noelle is omg

She’s so precious 😭
Noelle is actually the cutest person I’ve ever seen
Kids react to Until Dawn

Billie eilishes songs are to dark me:Holds back cuz shes a child

8:30 i cried when she said “billie elish”
Try to guess.
"My friends are obsessed with Billie O-lish"
Yes, whenever I see Billie Eilish, I am SHOOK
2:31 overeacted, she screamed like 3 seconds later lol
Make more of this or "try not to get scared" with kids. Those are my favorites along with "try not to laugh". They always make me laugh, even on my bad days.
Noelle is too adorable
First one a throw up
8:49 what the fuck was that 😂
Leo is so cute. What a courageous little fella
2:30 UNTIL DAWN YESS BBBBB
This was easy
I didn’t get scared 
The trick is to know what’s coming then you ain’t scared anymore
8:11 for the Billie Eillish one
that tida kid is a stoneface god
i seen billie, i clicked. simple
I want to be one of the fbe kids and just be emotionless the whole time
That little girl didn’t move at all with the bird 😂😂😂😂
Jake lowkey kinda pissed me off lmao
I’m seeing this 3 minutes after it was posted
This was easy
I like this gen better than the old one
“This is gunna b a jumpscare” wasn’t even fuckin lookin at the screen lmao
Jena gets scared from jump scares but not a Billie video which legit talks bout suicide? 😆
Noelle ♥️ ♥️ they r all so adorable
noelle is like the cutest, most innocent person ever
Billie EL as in elmo- ish 💀😂
Her songs aren’t dark. They’re deep. Ik they’re kids but I just hate when people are like that.
would have failed songs
Every single scary video isn't scary
Until dawn 2019?
1:03 So this is the generation that’s gonna save the planet?
I get this is a don't move challenge, but she told the kids to move to the center. Why wouldn't you move then?
Im all wiggly, I’m a worm
Noelle is waaaaayyy too cute
Noelle to cute
“This is gonna be a jump scare” then screams at the top of her lungs from the jumpscare
I love how Billie is one of the challenges XD
edit: BILLIE YOU GOTTA STEP UP YOUR GAME BABE THE KIDS AINT FREAKING
“I never moved my body I moved my legs”😂😂
Leo is so freaking cute when he’s trying so hard to not move and he gets frustrated he does 😂
Kids are kinda stupid lol
the last bit seemed kinda dickish. Get it was all fun and games, but most of the kids looked like they were still setting up for it and hadn't started.
They are scary cats
11:04 “ what’re you gonna do to me .. ? “ 💀.
So why exactly had to be every second video a jump scare video from a freacking horror game? are you so desperate to scare some kids ?
Ha ha stupid know kids
LEO DIDNTEIN ON THE SECOND ONE CAUSE HE WAS NOT SUPPOSE TO BLINK
That girls scream was like delayed I swear, like her brain took longer than it should have to register she should scream... Her body reacted instantly, then her brain ticked away and then made her scream... That was scarier than the video
i am very movily, i’m like a worm
I like  creepy  things
8:11 billieeeee 💗😭
and
8:39 she’s my new best friend 😭💞 cuz I don’t have much friends that are obsessed with Billie Eilish  as much as I am 😭
Forgot how difficult it is to watch Bear Grylls anything without feeling uneasy
i see Billie Eilish,I click
Billie gang?
I wouldn't move. Guess what I'm 11 .-.
“i never moves my body, i moved my legs.” 
logic
I thought Until Dawn died
10:34 I never moved my body I moved my legs  😂😂😂 I'm dead 😂
What happens if they like sneeze or cough? Does it count?
Why were the kids scared by an owl lol
Guys I didn’t move my body I moved my legs 😂😂
For the seconds one, i don’t know if i saw it wrong but all i saw was an owl... did i miss something
8:28 did she say billy oilish
All these kids are amazing, but I'm obsessed with Leo and Noelle!
How this is scary
3:00 thats reaction 100% real
I came because I saw  Billie Eilish
This is staged Leo didn’t even react to the 2nd scary one
If they would have busted out some Rick Astly no one would have survived.
omg Noelle is SO SO SO cute !
I like the twins 😂
One sister is like laser focus and the other sister is like "we gonna get McDonald's after this" lol 😂😂
I love how Jake takes his headphones off the same way Everytime😂😂
Alle die deutsch sind liken👍🏻
I find kids listening to Billie eilish depression songs unsettling
BILLIE EILISH I LV HER SO MUCH
i'm know she is gonna die
Jake is a bich
Omg Katrina just betrayed me, she said Elish and I’m done with this channel
Noelle is so cute! She's adorable
ngl tida a champ
When your comment from yesterday got pushed all the way to the bottom because people want to all of a sudden comment the day after the video was uploaded😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OK BUT WAS THAT RAMI MALEK IN UNTIL DAWN OR WAS I GLITCHING
6:44 😂 what the heck
Oh my literal god the first video with the worm literally gave me a mini anxiety attack and got me gagging. And with the one with the bugs i was like NOPE.
Everyone was out after the jumpscare of the bird, they were like hell no i aint dealing with that bird game again
Noelle needs to be on here a lot more she’s stinkin adorable!
3:51 that’s what she said
Easy.
It’s big Chungus size
do more of the jump scares one's!!!
I didn't move for any of them. Not even lying. 😂😘😜
Who else has played too much FNAF and scary games and now can't get scared by basic jumpscares like these? ✋
I love the Noelle girl, she is so cute and a darling
I came cuz it said Billie Eilish
Lmao, almost all the videos were from the Until Dawn reactions!
I love how half the videos are from until dawn😂
Did she say Billie oish
if i were on fbe:
staff: p-please move, eye- why don't you talk- how don't these things make you move.
Is Gabe a girl or a guy
I love how the kids are afraid of Billie!😂
Who knew birds were so scary
LOLLLLLLLLL
Can you do elders react to monopoly by Ariana grande
I for real have ticks with my heqd and shoulder y’all shou inv me for this challenge lol
It looks DeLiCiOuS (says sarcastically😂)
I pass all
why u torture some of the kids like that 😭😭😭
2:30 when someone spoils avengers Endgame
Until dawn is the winner lol
Until Dawn shouldn't be in a kids react..
I'm a simple girl. I see Nick Jonas... I click!!
when jena said she knew all of billie eilish songs..... isnt she like 5 years old
They got scared by a bird
You vs wild I love until dawn
i feel like it doesnt work when you give kids jumpscares. i mean they flinch, sure, but its not fun to watch. give them songs or something, like Sucker worked so well. and the kids just gave up on the jumpscares. i love ur videos but this one wasnt a good idea. 💙NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN THOUGH!! JUST GIVING A SUGGESTION PLEASE DONT SEE THIS COMMENT AS AN INSULT I LOVE REACT CHANNEL!!
Noelle,leo,Janelle and the twins should stay on this show.I really enjoyed this video with them in it,especially Noelle being cute the whole video.
I’m so mad how the girl said Eilish at 8:30 😤
NOELLE IS SO CUTEEE OMG
Wtf is Billy Eyelash
Not for them
1:40 "The perfect survival food" 
Spits out half of it and thus basically only eating the skin
y'all couldn't find anything better than FOUR until dawn jumpscares? they're literal children, do things that will make them laugh or dance or bop their heads instead, rather than jumpscares meant for adults. people (especially children) move for so many other reasons than being scared, jumpscares are cheap, low-hanging fruit in challenges like this. this can't be fun for them to film and it wasn't very fun to watch.
I’m a simple man, I see Billie I click! uwu
did y’all just put until dawn in a kids episode
The jump scares are not the scary
literally clicked for billie
i love Leo so much hahahahaha!!!!
6:42 “I know she’s gonna die” lmao I love her
NOELLE IS THE CUTEST THING EVER
I lost...... miserably.
Pusses
5:12 ok but she wasn’t even looking..
Ayyeee the until dawn vids I Acc miss that game 🤣
Billie Eilish :3
Billie :,)
Ethan is going to make a top tier reactor
I aced all of it
These kids have no idea who the Jonas Brothers are 😂
It’s you vs wild
is it just me, but gabe reminded me of billie eilish??
Until dawn scares everyone
2:32 was the scream necessary?
Leo didn’t move an inch on the jumpscare e.e
If i was there i can win this
That Horror game is called until doen
2:37 “that startled me” she’s so cute
Anyone else wanted Sydney on here?
Is it only me that hates Jake and every single person
iTs biG cHuNgUs siZE
I played that Horror game
That tida girl is way more of man than any of those guys will be
i never moved my body i moved my legs ~Ethan
“Ooh that looks delicious” I ended up dying when she said that
Jesus the jump scares are enough to make anyone move!! 😂 There were way too many for their little hearts lol bless them all 🖤
I lost on the first video and I’m 28
That anit fair for the children most of that stuff was scary
Drax would be so still that he’d turn invisible.
Girl at 2:30 started shaking and after 3 seconds she just realised it was a bird and started screaming
All of the jump scares never got me
Tida is a pro
It's big chungus size lmao
WEE SNAW WEE SNAW WEE SNAW WEE SNAW WEE SNAW
Noelie (I think??), oh my goodness, she is too much adorableness!! I just wanna huge her so much.
"Billie uhlish"

Have adults react to Joyner Lucas devils work
Rip editors with all those crosses

When I saw the first one I was closing my eyes but I also saw it a little bit I was DISGUSTED
I love how they keep using U til dawn clips for the jump scares
Why'd you put Billie in this??
Why is Leo out?!
#Leonevermoved
Jake is hilarious 😂🤣
React to Joyner Lucas Devils Work!
Tida is so cute, I can't❤ And Noelle is so precious❤
Honestly I think Billie eilish is overrated
Jake, cmon mate... Just don’t give up already like that.

Until dawn has scencea like people being cut in half and sawed in half. Why would they even show any scene from that game. What if one kid asked what is it called. And the producers had no clue what it was about and the details. So anyway they just said, 
"until dawn"

The kid buys it. Plays it, then scars himself for 4 years😐

I get liking Billie Eilish, but I think this kids are a little to young to understand or at least relate to the lyrics. Just my opinion though.


...Also, what is their problem with Until Dawn, since they showed the first clip from the game, they refused to even give the others a try.
We want lucas😂

6:43 „I know She’s gonna die” 
Beautiful words.
These kids get scared when a fly crashes in the wall
It is quite interesting to see how different-minded two siblings can be, even if they look very similar to each other, like Payton and Reagan. In my mind, I have good hopes for Payton and her approach in using her patience and afterthought to achieve other things than her sister Reagan does by being more physically active and reacting in a more direct manner. Thanks for all the reactions, especially to all the reactors in this episode. Wish I had been this much outspoken about my feelings when I was a kid.

Until Dawn is scary even as an adult lol it doesn't get me when watching this but when I played the game for the first time I was terrified a few times lol at least they didnt show the wendegos lol

I failed to not move on the first one. That made me feel a bit unwell.
Aside from that, great video. 😸👍
This is more like "try not be a psychopath challenge" to me😑.. Why are we telling these kids to not react / feel anything to anything? Don't suppress your feelings people😑..
I'd pay for the snake/bug bath, that just looks fun

Dem kids dumb its a try not to move you just close your eyes and you cant get scared lmao
I won and did not move but I am ten
I would be mad if I had to do the last one
Am I the only one that got Katrina and tida confused
I failed immediately
Those kids shouldn't be listening to or watching those Billie Idol music videos.
janelle looks like the little sister from bridge to terabitha
very movily
It's funny how they end the video themselves
Noelle is too adorable to handle

Please  react to the whole album of Map of the Soul: Persona that just came out, it's a BOP! And also the live performance of Dionysus too, it's interesting how they take some Greek influences into their work. Each song has such a good meaning. If you do react to it us ARMYs would be very grateful. Thank you!!
8:51 We can see that...
the wolf jumpscare they where like HELL NAH and everyone was scared like  lol i did with you guys and i didnt move alot
Why do I want to adopt like, 6 of them? Bless them.
I could beat all of them EXCEPT for the first
tourettes intensifies
The girl who called that grub “Big Chungus” is my hero
I could of beat this challenge easily... (except for the last one)
They should remove the jumpscares and make a different challenge called try not to flinch. Then put a bunch of scary shit jumpscares hahaha I would watch that X'D
Gabe u gey boi
GENERATIONS REACT TO ALEC BENJAMIN
Everyone reacts to “the Dog” https://youtu.be/Uoxu8wcO21w PLS REACT TO THIS!!!! It’s really worth it!!

All these kids afraid of until dawn. That isn’t even the scary wendigo stuff
Jake is such a mood
i played until dawn a hundred times  it won't scare me
Tida has balls of steel💪💪💪
They should do the one where this guy misses a basketball and hits the camera, the first time I saw I swung my face like it was really going to hit me
4:51 Look how every kid gives up
4:40 I hate this kid
6:54 Alison Sweeney is me when I see a june bug flying toward me.
Tida is a beast!
Keep it together Noelle👏👏👏
Keep it together

This list is so wrong. Everyone can have an opinion but I feel like they really messed this up.
This list is messed up
where is endgame
Bunch of idiots, but hey, lets just say the trailer is just shit accuracy of how movie is, and basically winter soldier was the 9th trailer and you know everybody had to rush their top 4 so there were no places or maybe they are just idiots they haven’t seen it yet, honestly for me personally i only knew winter soldier existed in 2018, i never cared for cap movies until i seen civil war i thought i be cool to watch winter soldier so i did, also whats a shithole about it is that in my country there is every marvel movie until 2017 that has released except winter soldier i dunno why they don’t want to release that in out tv channels, they are idiots
The Winter Soldier was so disrespected in this list
When Brittany said she havent seen any marvel films😲😲. Like what time line is she from? 0:43
Can't tell ya'll how much my eye twitched when Winter Soldier was at 9 like... excUSE ME
I love geroge
This list is so off
Winter Soldier must be in top 3
This list is a shame! Winter soldier is too low!
I miss Ant-man in this top 10
Where is doctor strange man ?
7:50 she's so good looking...
Wakanda wakanda
I think that age of Ultron should have replaced the first avengers, I really don't think the first avengers is as good as the others
Guardians of the Galaxy is the best i think
Winter Soldier easily top 3, if not THE best
iron man dies
Okay who made the top 10 final list because it’s trash. Thanos i need you here
Wow whover put Winter Soldier at 9 need to get snapped. It was at least top 3
And now Tony and Nat are dead 💔😶
I still can't believe it
A 3 year old could easily make a better list than this
Elders react to Kendrick Lamar DAMN album!! Lyric breakdown too!!
Watched this video 5 times and highest score I got was 13. Getting better each time
This was so wrong. RIP civil war and avengers😢 and where was doctor strange. (It should have been instead of gog2)
Iron Man dies in endgame :(
This is one of those videos I wish I had played along with 😭
Why isnt doctor strange in it? It was fantastic!
Kristine: I love Tony Stark so much

Me: Don’t get to attached
God, who the fuck made that top 10 final??
How tf could someone NOT see Winter Soldier?! That movie is hands down the  BEST Marvel movie. It changed everything in the MCU. It's the only reason the Russo Brothers started directing the Avengers movies. The rank these movies are in is blasphemous. The disrespect to Iron Man, too. Smh.
got a score of 9 i'm impressed by myself but i think that's because i know how hyped every movie is hyped thanks to social media
Where is Doctor Strange? The best movie of all time... What the F....
I miss you iron man 3000
okkk who put winter soldier below BP...
I love Spider-Man he's  the best.
9:00 you... you have to be fucking with me? YOUR JOKING RIGHT!
Why is Brittany even here? She's not even a Marvel fan. She saw ONE movie out of the 22. Her ranking was unnecessary in my opinion.
You shouldn't watch infinity war / endgame if you haven't seen all the movies imo. True there might be standalone movies but they're still related.
“Thor Ragnorak wasn’t a big deal to marvel fans” Jesus Christ someone tell Bruce Jenner to turn it in
My head hurt to bad watching this
5:25 Who called this crusty old guy,god dammit
Reacters Assemble
People are stupid most people don’t know what was going on in any of those movies
My boy Antman isnt here (not a joke)
Iron man is straight top 3
wtf....so wrong on so many levels....whatever....but still ...wtf
You guys should've brought actual comicbook/Marvel fans, like Chelsea. While it is heartwarming to watch these people, I feel that Chelsea deserved to be in this video more than anyone else, and likely would've showed a greater level of enthusiasm.
I'm literally the only person that has seen every Marvel movie apparently
Thor ragnarok was hilarious, number one in my opinion
Omg this list is painful to watch
WTF you didn't watch Winter Soldier IMO the best one.
Okay then,  I guess I am seriously the only person who would put Captain Marvel in my top 10, with 1 probably being a tie between Winter soldier, and infinity war (haven't seen End Game yet). I will never see how Ragnarok even made this list over cpt. Marvel TBH. Keep in mind though,  I have personally never read any of the original source material.
Captain Marvel didn’t even have a chance on this list 😂
boi, civil war and winter soldier are way better than ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 I DON'T GET IT WHY THEY'RE ON 8 AND 9. I'M SO MAD👺👺👺
9:00 you... you have to be fucking with me? YOUR JOKING RIGHT!
10:30 fr
9:14 yes. We know you know.
1:36 Welp
How is guardians 2 even on there
I dont know why but everytime i see spiderman it makes me happy
you can't just rank mcu movies if you never really watch them
I got 7 so I guess that’s solid... but Endgame is the new no. 1
I just like how the guy at 9:35 spoils endgame
Groot is sooo cute 

That's me
I loved Spider-Man: Homecoming


I just love it 😂
Who’s excited for asgardians of the galaxy?
Weird list but okay....
Whack ass list
If you think GOTG 2 is better than the first one, you have a problem
GOTG volume 2 at number 10 shocking
Jesus... their taste...
this list is so fucked up
"Say a line, look at the sky for a few seconds,  make eye contact.... say the next line. Remember, this film has to be 3 hrs." -Endgame director.
After watching End Game 3x...I am now rewatching all 22 movies😂😂
Excuse me did he just judge the iron man movie on he’s appearance your kidding me
where was doctor strange!!!!!!!
1. Winter Soldier
2. Thor:Ragnarok
3. Endgame

Nothing else matters
the taste.... it's rancid
I have seen the movie it's awesome but I will not spoil nothing it's an awesome movie go watch end game
everyone has their own list, mind your own. . . but yeah it is quite a bad list :p
This is an awful list
Terrible list. I'd say half the people that voted haven't even seen the movies and just voted based on hype
1. Infinity War
2. Ragnarok
3. Civil War
4. Winter Soldier
5. Iron Man

6/7 Guardians, both on par.


The rest were pretty average don't care what order.
Get this man...

Hey. Have you guys done It Chapter Two yet?

8:38 tell your daughter to HMU she has great taste in movies!!!
Winter soilder is easily number 1, it’s the reason marvel stepped their game up. Other then iron man all the marvel films were meh before the winter soilder it basically changed all the mcu and is the reason the Russo’s got to direct infinity war and endgame
Fuck out of here winter soilder is easily top 3 fuck u put it at 9 for?????
I agree with that guy “yal are fools”
Bro I love brandon so much because his favourite is Spider-Man and I Stan tom holland
3:14 
WOMAN, WUT? I don’t think she watches these movies correctly.
I'm so mad that they didn't spell Spider-Man like this Spider-Man but like this Spiderman
Not to rain on anyone’s parade but the list seriously did not look like it was made by true marvel fans
“Infinity war .?! 
I am just gonna put it on number 8”
BAHAHAHAHAHA AHHHHH just saw the "final" list. I'm sorry, what group of people were surveyed? not real fans, that's for damn sure. absolute TRASH list.
REACT TO LOGIC - HOMICIDE FT. EMINEM
Everyone has their own favorites & least favorites
Doesn't make you any less of a Marvel fan
damn if you got hardcore marvel stans on there the list would have been completely different
9:06 girl same here!!
Iron Man 1 for ever
I got 7 points 🎉
This list is garbage
The list is just plain wrong
Winter Soldier should be No.1
yes
Thor ragnarok is my favorite movie apart fron infinity war and end game
End game will soon Over pass Avatar 🤣🤣🤣 Now Let's See who says NO!! It's The Biggest And Bestest movie of all time! Told you! Marvel Never Disappoints 💪😂
What trash is this list?!?!?!?!
Dutch reaction please
this is painful to watch ngl
Winter soldier dhould be higher, GOTG should be a little lower...
You can tell that out of these 331 people, only less than half are big comic books fan XD, you can tell by how the list was made...
What a weird list, Winter Soldier shouldve been up there
In my opinion infinity war was better then endgame. Endgame comes in second for sure tho
This list is so fucking garbage
Tony: Love u 3000
winter soldier made me fall asleep it was such shit sorry Bucky stans
Ant man is so underrated
Where is endgame
RIP Stan lee he was a great man like if you agree
Winter soldier is my favorite marvel movie of all time wtf
logang
8:45 that’s called a sequel buddy
People in the comments be like "If you don't agree with me then you must die"
Guardians of the Galaxy will forever be my favorite
End game is the best, PERIODT!!
'We have seen so many people play Spider Man, so there's nothing new'
Boy is that man so wrong
”well that Was my second choice” 😂
"I love Tony Stark so much."
Hmmm
But they don't count the TV shows, Netflix or Hulu shows, or One-Shots
React on Game of Thrones season 8 memes!
Ya'll wack for not having Avengers 1 in Top 3
Winter Soldier is the best Marvel movie ever😍😍
I’m I the only who care about detective pikachu???
IM KIDDING THE OLD MAN IS 1000 IQ AND KNOWS HOW TO RATE MARVEL MOVIES I LOVE HIM
Not being rude. So the 80 year old man just put the best movies more than top 5? Why?

The question is why though?

 Because he has not seen any of them yet because of how the trailer is.
Senior Year Person: Im picking Iron Man at 7 too old..
Middle Aged Year Person: Yeah Avengers is 6
Teen Year Person: Ok Avengers is 4
Kid Year Person: So uh... Iron Man at 1.. Avengers at 2
Baby Year Person: gooGa man at numba what again?
Thor ragnarok 4 and winter soldier 9. I hope this is a big joke
my man roger popped off
civil war is what got me into marvel movies. but i love the original hulk movie and the original spiderman movies with toby

3:15 Um you mean DC???
My top 5:
1. Avengers
2. Infinity War/ Iron Man

Finally in the first 10 min.#notifcationsquad.Hi yt . that's all I want to say.also like endgame the best
Winter Soldier and civil war so low... Nah...
Everyone: this list is trash beacuse it's not my opinion

Cries in age of Ultron
Oooof I did better than them all, I got 8/20
The elder knows his stuff
This list is so trash just like the fbe staff
Y’all comments need to chill, this is all based on people’s opinions. And personally I agree with most of the list (I haven’t seen winter soldier though so I don’t really have an opinion on that one).
React to T3r Elemento
Fbe staff is kinda weird
You know its trash when winter soldier is FREAKING 9
9:00...😐😐😐😐oof that really hurt
FBE.  Y'ALL ARE TRIPPING
This is bothering me....HOW IN THE FLYING FUCK IS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY ABOVE INFINITY WAR?!? ARE U FUCKING ED?

This list... I'm sorry but this list is trash
This list is ass af
My fav was HOCO yes brando
This list is legit trash lol
My favorite is Endgame
"He's relatable and he's hot as fuck"
I too love Drax.
Guess the correct order....... of what? I literally thought this was opinion based, so what is this based on? Preference of Jesus?
Ig opinions are wrong now 🤷🏽‍♀️
I’m sorry but I hate the guardian of the galaxy movies and characters
3:56 wtf is that
9:00 that hurt me.
Trash list
I guess that opinions can be wrong...
You guys should do a top ten war movies!
5:25 dude wtf ??
I find it quite funny that people commenting here saying that the list is sh*t and bad but this is only based on the people and the staff of fbe. We all have our own opinions. No offense though ✌
i love this franchise 3000, while i love the list around 8 to 900
age of ultron?
My 4 favorites (in no particular order) are: Iron Man, Spider-Man Homecoming, Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers Infinity War
loki:YOUR SAVIER IS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
me:*blood comes out of nose*
This list makes no sense, BP NUMBER 1?? It's good and up there, but not number one. Way too over hyped, because of the social implications. I'd put it at like #4-5.
Teens react to juice wrldd
Ok wait a minute how is guardians of the galaxy vol 2 last that was such a good movie 🤷‍♂️
This list is stupid
I understand everyone has different tastes but WS at no 9?
Im sorry that a trash taste.
Wow this is straight trash
How did Roger win!
Rogers an OG
7:44
" Marvel movies can be a little bit dark"

Girl what!?!?😂😂
I got 6 points, I'm pretty proud of myself.
3:20 his Killmonger!?
It’s funny because my last name is Parker so I am peter Parker hehehe
I love how roger was the highest scorer
Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if more than half of those 331 people haven’t even seen all the marvel movies
This list is way off lol this list is complete garbage
if they were talking about all Marvel movies. Spider-man into the spider-verse is #1
No one ranks marvel movies like this
At 6:22 I just want to punch that guy so much.That movie was so good.
1:52 that just pisses me off so much like can I please punch that guy
What a garbage list
what is up with these FBE members ranking the Cap movies so low when they are so good!
This list is horrible
“That was my second choice” 😂😂
This list ass
They all should be number one 🤷🏻‍♀️🥰
i find this so offending for some reason
Got 8 pointssssss
11:55 a little over hyped coming from a person in the cast (this is a joke)
Winter soldier is easy top4
If avengers is gud movie then what fbe
Iron Man is my nr. 1 no one can change my mind
Winter soldier at 9? And guardians volume 2 is in this list?! WHY?!
3:45 ***SOOOOOOO relatable!!!
how tf is winter soldier 9??
7:44 Best horror movie by far
This list is whack
winter soldier is slept on no cap
Replace vol 2 with endgame, also this list is genuinely not accurate at all
Who made this list lmao
where's doctor strange?
Next they should react to Trevor Noah
honestly i'm suprised people didn't like endgame its so good
7:44When someone sneaks In your house In 5 In the morning

Blackpanther is so Overrated 🤦🏻‍♂️

Infinity War should be number 1
who are these 331 people ?
I love you three thousand.
 

V       Like if u understand
IRON MAN DIE 







It has pass 2 weeks sense the movie came out. Shame on you!
Most people said no!

“Well that was my second guess”
The first thing i said before watching this was i better see GOTG 1 on number 1 spot one every list
I'm just glad Guardians of the Galaxy is #2. XD
Dr strange was better than both guardians of the galaxy
Unpopular opinion: End Game was over hyped and not as good as infinity.
Im a big fan of the comics so everyone's N°1 wont be like mine




Chooses thor Ragnarok
Dr. Strange was good too.. 
Why they didn't include it?
the guy at 1:53 shouldn't be there
0:33 I feel bad for her! :D
I played along and I got 8 points. That's pretty good considering that I put Avengers and Iron Man as 1 and 2.
I´m Iron Man
Deadpool 1
Why is Guardians of the galaxy so low?! And winter soldier!!

Is that a joke to you?!
U want to spoiled sure 3 people d#$@
Yes im al$ost c@# but its #%
I like EndGame and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in my opinion
The first Thor movie was better than a few of these. Period.

5. Iron Man 
6. Guardians of the Galaxy
7. Civil War
8. Thor: Ragnarok

Why the fuck is Winter Soldier at 9?
The number one movie in their list is crap. No way is that movie number one. ESPECIALLY considering the other movies to compare it to.
A lot of people are having different opinions, so just don't think that your opinion is the absolute, like saying things like this list is absurd, trash whatever...it may be different in various region so no list is absolute.
This list is based off of popular opinion, in the US atleast, that I can guarantee.
I know why some of them said no cause spooderman / spiderman has no father now
Like if u agree :3
11:49 looks a bit like kilmonger
Who put the old man on the show infinity war at 8???😂
3:15
DC: "Hold my beer"
this list is trash because it's marvel
JK come at me
Actually infinity war was the biggest of 2018.
We are in the Endgame now.
10!
Iron man died
Shouldn't roger have 7 points since he had iron man 1 away?
Wait, a franchise is 2 movies
"It helps when you dont know so much" I LOST IT
Wtf with winter soldier ? Why everyone in the comment are talking about it ?? In my opinion this film was not so good.
I cried soo much in endgame when spongebob died😭🥺
I love all of the mcu movies they are the best!
Also I put Dr strange at number 1 hands down

Like if you love marvel!
yeah i love endgame, great payoff to the previous 21 films, but as far as marvel movies go it isn’t number 1. def in my top 10, but since endgame finishes the story the previous 21 movies set up it isn’t the best stand alone film (wasn’t meant to be though, its prob my number 4 or 5)
Hate this comments, so negative.
this list is absolutely absurd and i’m appalled
and endgame is easily the best mcu movie fuck ya’ll
Six points .... :P 
But I was able to guess 9 of the 10 movies on the list before watching the video, so that's something I guess.
alot of marvel movies are dark? is this lady stupid or something
How is Winter Soldier so low!? Y'all are idiots.
that one grandpa who didn’t know anything but than got the most points really warmed my heart
Shitty list
If only one person reads this it would really make my day.I know fame doesn’t occur over night but I am trying my best to become a youtuber. Wish me luck and it would mean a lot if you subbed👍🏼
Actually infinity war was the biggest of 2018.
This list was trash
1:50 what the fuck IS THAT
"Well...that was my second choice." Lol Roger is the man.
Avengers Endgame is the BEST Marvel movie EVER!!!
Civil war at 8?? come onn
And he’s hot as fuck and groot is so cute 
I died of laughter
1:22 actually there's only 7 Spider-Man films (Not including Animated)
HELL YES
"Surprisingly, the majority of people said no. It wouldn't be their new number one. Pe–"
"Well, that was my second choice."
Please react to Ateez
Guardians of the galaxy sucked change my mind
Where is age ultron
Winter Soldier at 9 and GOTG at 2? WTF have these people been watching?
Iron man is so over hip his the new favorite now just because of End game
Came here after watching ScreenJunkies and WatchMojo’s own rank lists 😂
Winter soldier 9? Tf u smoking
I disagree with most of this list.
Yes Thor number 1
there is just a whole lot of wrong with these lists... IN MY OPINION THO

+ one last thing at 9:33 did he rlly just put civil war at 10th pla- yeah otay seems legit
BOI
I have a lot of nostalgia for iron if not 1st at least top 3
Crappy list
Brandon stop what you're doing and watch Cap 2.
Bruh she said thor is hot has u seen end game
crappy list
Switch GOTG 2 with Iron Man and the real list is from 10 to 1.
Wow the actual list the staff put together is shit
What about Spider-Man into the spider verse?
the poor old man who knew nothing won. and the adults called themselves marvel fans. smh
How can you rank them when you did not watch them all??
"what if we used 100% off the brain?"
12:51
The official list is so wrong and I think I’m having a brain aneurism because of it
Also my fav movie is endgame and its better than all the marvel movie combined
Thor came from soo ripped to melted ice cream like wth marvel and people say he’s the second most powerful
Surprised Doctor Strange didn’t make the list. I honestly love that movie so much it was so good. It’s my top 3
R E M O V E  G E O R G E
Omg Brandon I relate homecoming is my favorite 💗👏🏻
This list is way off.
Winter Soldier should NOT be at 9.  Best (mostly) solo movie
Liking ‘Ragnarok’ more than the original ‘Thor’ is so stupid. It’s like morons who rate ‘The Empire Strikes Back’ above ‘A New Hope’. People need to grasp that the first film sets up the whole universe, sometimes literally, so any better aspects of sequels are still only standing on the shoulders of giants.
I saw ‘Guardians and the Galaxy 2’ two years ago yesterday in La Paz, the day after I had my throat slashed open in the street and needed ten stitches.
She knew it but she didn’t do it
Anyone who puts ‘Infinity War’ in the top ten has serious mental-health problems.
Shit list
4
the girl who said there were 50 spidermen is my mood
I love Iron Man 3000
the poor old man who knew nothing won. and the adults called themselves marvel fans. smh
Jim: I don't think infinity war is a great movie
Also Jim: Guardians of the galaxy 2 is one of the best Marvel movies
Me: HELL NO!!!
i feel bad for the guy too old to know them
“marvel movies can be a little dark”

deadass the most lighthearted movies
Well Doctor Strange was my favorite, but only comic fans saw that. These people are mcu fans, not marvel fans
12:54 well that was my second choice 

Knowledge: OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!
0:33 😀😀....🤬🤬🤬how are u even here
12:52 hahaha this man 😂😂
“I love you 3,000” 😪😖🤫
1. Infinity war
2. Civil War
3. Winter Soldier
4. Avengers
5. Thor Ragnorak or guardians of galaxy

Edit: holy shit the people who voted don’t know anything about Marvel
"He's handsome" - Little did she know...
This video pissed me of
You know being s true marvel fan and knowing everything about marvel and all that, you get really upset at how people categorize the movies or when they say stuff about marvel that doesnt make sense or isnt true 😂😂, am i the only one?
They could have chosen 3,000 fans.
12:53 
“That was my second choice.”

Im dead 🤣
I love all the mcu movie but I think my fav is ragnorock
Wow your office has no taste.
got 11 points but im still mad ab winter soldier being 9 like....
Ignorance is a blessing
A good advice for your life from the old guy.
when she said Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 was better than the first I FELT THAT!!!!!
Anybody else do this themselves? I got 8 points
Yea 50 of them
that curly girl. jeez just walk out the room
Lol the old dude got 6 point and don’t know anything
They should of picked marvel fans for this video. The girl with the curly hair is getting on my nerves.
Everyone know guardians one is the best marvel movie
Marvel Studios in my opinion is the best franchise of all time
“ I hAvEn’T SeEN AnY”- dumb b
Get the fuck out!! 
There’s the door
What happened to spider verse🤔
Spiderman is #1
Endgame, Captian Marvel How???
They are all number one, done, next!
This video need it to happen
I can’t believe that they are missing dr Strange that was my fav
There was barely any bucky
331 people?? R y’all on crack??
React to The Umbrella Academy?
Is george a girl or boy???
Endgame reached a billion dollars
Love the elders man
I wish I was in this because I LOVE    The MCU marvel cinematic universe
This list is wrong
That’s ur opinion that infinity war is 3
Spiderman 1 with Toby McGuire is the best Marvel movie ever made.
Endgame was number 1
Infinite war should have been number 1
Civil war is by far the worst MCU movie.
This list is kind of bullsht.. Infinity War has to be #1 and how did more people say No to endgame being #1?? Dafucc
Wtf How do you guess your Favourite Marvel Movie wrong?!?!?!?!?
Having Winter Soldier at 9 automatically made this list trash
What about Captain Marvel??
White hair guy: hes relatable, talented,... HOT ASF
Me: SAME
Am I the only person who thought end game was shit
Over 1 billion dollars is “a little static”?
That sucked
If Infinity War isn't #1, then you're all wrong.  BP is a great movie but overrated.  Winter Soldier is also another top 5 movie.  I also love Guardians, but being number 2 is laughable.
My mom: do you wanna order a pizza?

Me: 6:42
endgame, winter soldier, ragnorok
for real people should have put iron man the OG higher up.
Winter soldier, civil war and avengers should be MUCH higher
that list really ain't it lmao
Did she just say Marvel movies can be dark?
Come on guys, we all know if you have/haven’t seen it that Endgame reigns number 1
Winter Soldier is THE BEST marvel movie. Don't @ me
Y'all are sleeping on Winter Soldier
Spoilers for Endgame:





Shrek dies in Endgame.
Winter Soldier at NINE? REALLY?! NINE?! It's number one c'mon!
That one thing has the emotional baggage of a woman and the dumbassery of a man; the worst of both, smh. Get that thing outta here!!! Ugh, need some eyebleach and good music for my ears after its screentime.
Wakanda
Oof I must say guardians of the galaxy 2 should NOT be at 10
Get real fans to rank this stuff come on. This is sad. People arent ranking this properly.
:)
This list is a joke like Thor Ragnarok so don’t take it seriously
Am I the only one who like age of ultron
Top ten retro video games sold
Wtf why is everyone sleeping on age of ultron
The real list is soooooo weird it’s looks like a random list but 331 people did this?
Come on!
React to Rosalia!!!
Do see Winter Soldier and Civil War so low; I’m disappointed 😞
My top 5 marvel movies:
1) Avengers Infinity War
2) The Avengers
3) Avengers End Game
4) Guardians of the Galaxy
5) Thor Ragnarok
2/10
Wakanda Forever!!!
Wow, that's a shitty list.
I got a six on this list, including spot-on predictions for Guardians 2 and the first Avengers movie. When comparing this Top Ten list to my personal rankings, I'll definitely take it.
My top 3 
1. Guardians of the galaxy
2. Winter soldier ( AWSOME movie )
3. Civil war ( Zemo was AWSOME for me )
12:53 😂😂😂
Team Cap all day long
331 "fans"? Lol, it's more like 331 "oh everyone is talking about this movie so i need to see it even though i don't know what it is" people who don't have good taste in Movies
I've got 7 points
Wow...george is so shitty
It would be cool if they reacted to oliver tree
This list is pretty wrong..wth
How the hell did guardians of the galaxy beat infinity war and how the hell did civil war get 8th place
331 dumb people
In my opinion spiderman deserves to be #1
man...thats a fuckin shitty list
Roger is the best
Nahhhh
Am I the only one who thinks that Winter Soldier was just good and nothing more
Whre my boy doctor strange ?? That movie is really good "fbe i come to bargain"
Yo they taste is mad garbage get out of here with that goofytown
Never let George be on another video..
I got 10 points! 💗
And endgame is s masterpiece of a movie
Winter Soldier is one of the best movies... What the heck...
Could someone put these movies in chronological order so I can watch them?
BS..!!!
Thor: ragnarok was the part of thanos wanna take over the world or something (idc) so it was before infinity war and endgame
i can't believe that old man had me beat by one point
Civil war number 8...
Come on
I wanna know if Endgame DID become everyone’s number 1???
Winter Soldier has got to be top 5
Ok... where is Iron Man 2?
Who tf made that list,DC?!?!?
winter soldier at 9 lmao,your opinion is trash
Ignorance is bliss 😅
These 331 "fans" are fucking it up by putting Winter Soldier on 9th.
The way George reacted to Guardians of the Galaxy not being number one is me if anything I like does not make first place on anything.
First avengers I was soooooo stocked so I think it’s number 1
Usually I'm not one to judge but those who said that Avengers was 7....




The Fuck is wrong with you
Guardians 2 made the list but Ant Man or Ant Man and The Wasp didnt. I bet those people like CGI action more than practacle action.
The person at 1:50 was weird
I disagree that Avengers and Civil War is not on the top five.My top five are Infinity War,BlackPanther,Iron man,Avengers,Civil War
Okay i'm going to be honest, i'm a bit dissapointed with FBE. They picked reactors that don't know anything about the mcu.
- Aiko after finding out she geeks out about marvel, the hype is real... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4dKHNntdis
Definitley not their favorite movie because iron man died oops
Most of the people that comment are people who doesn't accept this list, so finding many not accepting this list than accepting in here would be natural. People who accepts the list doesn't comment, as only people who doesn't accept voices their opinions.
Get that trans lookin ass the fuck outta here.
RIP Iron Man
We love you 3000 ❤️
It's Spider-Man not Spiderman.
I'm in love with Brittany ❤️. She's so cool.
All these top tens give me brain damage
This list is stressing me out
LE GASP
How is winter soldier number 9!!?!!!
There is no age of ultron
Spider Man the Original one you didn't include it
put some respect on Cap's name damn it
7:05 she is so good looking
Wtf is that things??
Fuck out  this  trans genderman pls i dont look that movie
Iron Man must be number one
So many of these people haven't even seen the MCU films, wtf is even the point of this?
The list is so wrong
I thought ant man 1 would be on the list...
What the hell is that list!
YES JIM! Ragnarok is definitely the best when someone has read the comicbooks! :D
My top 5:
1. Thor: Ragnarok
2. Iron Man
3. Dr Strange
4. Guardians vol. 1
5. The Avengers
SO GLAD to see people appreciating guardians of the galaxy. it's my personal favorite but i feel like not so many people would put it above the other ones just because it's not as "serious", you know, which is a pity cause both guardians movies snap.
This list was so wrong the old man did better and he only looked at the comics in a sense
These 331 people must have AirPods when they were watching the movie. Trash list
"Lot of Marvel movies are bit dark"

Lmfao
This list makes me puke
8:59 GTFO you must be an team iron man dont you, well to be honest i was team iron man too but saying like that to cap like What?
THIS LIST IS SO STUPID.....
Well, I'm glad I at least got better then the cast in this ep. Got 7 points, lol, bad, I know XD I just couldn't adjust some of my most loved ones...
I think winter solider and civil war were the best
The Winter Soldier being anything but #1 is a mistake
There's no way those all 331 people watched all 22 movies. If they did, this list would be completely different. mentally pissed
Roger's answer: ´´Yes´´ . Actual answer: No. Roger: ´´Well, that's my second choice´´.
c´mon winter soldier is number one- i have watched it so many times: 

it has really cool action scene
a good plot
a heartfelt moment with peggy 

it so freacking good
should’ve expected endgame spoilers in the comments smh
y’all sleeping on dr strange
R/Thanosdidnothingwrong
Who are the 331 people?did they watch all the 22 movies?
No love for Doctor Strange? You guys really are fools.
yo I don’t watch marvel and know there aren’t 50 spider man’s what???
LMAOOOOO WTF THE OLD MAN WON
I didn't like Endgame cuz  Natasha and Tony died😤😤😤
What?? No into the spiderverse?? That one would be my number one
"Well that was my second choice" im laughing so hard right now 12:54
That top 10 was all kinds of wrong! 😤
Iron Man dies
They didn't vote for dr strange ? Damn
Please no! Not the Walkman!!!
8:37 my friend fav marvel film
The one who ranked winter soldier at 10 they don't know awesome movies. top 3 in my list
Age of Ultron would be in my top 10 maybe at like 6th or 7th place.
WTF! Winter Soldier No.9?!!
Oh, it's ranking by people's favourite and not how good they were... sometimes I hate people lol.
I got 6 points :'D
That was hard, but I kinda agree with the top 5...even if I would switch the number 1 and number 5.
And: people are wrong about Endgame, because it is the best MCU movie so far 😤
Fell in love with Aiko after finding out she geeks out about marvel, the hype is real
Stop putting adverts in please
all of the Russo Brother movies are at the top of the list. I don't care what anyone else says, if you disagree with me, YOU'RE WRONG
TWS at 9, Civil War at 8? This list is wack.
5:12 : I never agreed more with infinity war
winter soldier at 9 and blackpanther at 1? smh
The lady at 3:15 has literally never seen a a Marvel movie if she seriously just said that they're mostly "Dark movies" lmao wtf
lmao this is terrible
No Doctor Strange :(
The old man that probably hasn't ever watched a marvel movie in his life won...............what has happened to the marvel fanbase
I LOVE YOU 3000
Dude I got 9 points 😎
Wtf you mean by saying that not a lot of people like cap that much??
Everyone love him not just because of his looks but due to other qualities too
U guys forgot end game
That list is trash, they don't know  anything about movies.
All there listing mcu movies together without knowing about mcu movies. Bunch of A holes
This list is trash
Ragnarok over Iron man ? cmon fuck off
Am I the only person that gets goose bumps from all these trailers
Wtf is FBE ? Sounds like shit from a craigslist post.
Wow theses lists 😂
Is this based on people's trailer reactions or people who've actually seen the movies? I feel like they're just knee jerk rankings. I refuse to believe Winter Soldier was placed at number 9.
Am so End game is not event there you guys wow
Man. Sleepin on the first avenger.
Infinity war should be #1
The mofo pisses me off
I got 7 points😌
omg loveeee spiderman/ love tom holland
Those people are idiots
*watching this is so hard*🤦‍♂️
Hi
Sorry but those 331 people are idiots.
I literally just watched this for Captain Marvel... and she wasn’t there.😭😂
U guys forgot end game
I got 8 points 🤟🏼
My favourite marvel movie is deadpool 2
Well, my favourite movie of the MCU wasn't mentioned at all: Doctor Strange
Who are these 331 people? I'm just curious. I ain't throwing a bus towards them or anything. Just curious.
Tf with that rank, smh
that old guy who put infinity war in number 8? yeah yeah fuck u
Doctor strange?
At the final part and then every has a hologram of iron saying like good bye and at the end he said to her daughter I love you 3000
12:53 that was my second choice, hahahahahaha
1:50 what the fuck is that ?
My top 10
1) Avengers infinity war 
2) Avengers endgame 
3) Civil war
4) Guardians of the Galaxy
5) Avengers
6) Winter soilder
7)Thor Ragnarok
8) Doctor Strange
9) Ant-man
10) Spiderman 

Honerable mentions
Gotg Vol 2 and Captain marvel 

 
The Russo Brothers are Marvel's best Directors. Don't question my opinions :)
That’s honestly stupid that BP got number 1 ngl man, people are stupid
9:35 I was like wut but then I realised. RDJ is Chesburg3000
Why are non marvel fans guessing and ranking the fckin films 🤔😡 get some people who know their shit ffs
9:01 seriously people love captain for his look...wtf
Can you guys react to top 10 best Avenger themed TikTok pls!!!!??!?????
This shit is fucked up
dun dun dun dun dun
The list is so so wrong
This list is fuked up
Teens/college kids react to hyphy music
I WAS WAITING FOR DOCTOR 👏 STRANGE 👏
Rip iron man
9:00 I mean... WHAT??? He's a lot of people's favourite characters, he has the best arc and storyline, and DAMN, THAT SCENE WHEN HE WAS WORTHY OF MJOLNIR AND WHEN HE WAS READY TO FACE A WHOLE ARMY PLUS THANOS BY HIMSELF made him the best Avenger along with Tony.
Having winter soldier that low is a sin
Tim holland
This list is so wrong
this is hard to watch lmao the list is so fucked up rip
Yeah its sad when spiderman dies
Tbh not surprise Civil War is that low, low key overhyped imo
12 points!!! Winter Soldier will always be my number 1, no matter what this list says
WINTER SOLDIER IS NUMBER 1
Iron Man will always be my favorite no matter what other people💕
10:27 PREACH
That Trans guy tho
Just want to say that isn't anything bad about Roger (the elder gent), but if the guy who openly admits he knows Jack Schitt about the MCU is the one to win your challenge, then maybe those 331 people are really really wrong here. XD

P.S. I don't care if it was just their opinions, this is just my opinion. So... ;P

Edit: I just realized that my Google voice to text auto corrected jack shit to Jack Schitt, and I'm just going to leave it like that cuz that's hilarious. 🤣
Most of the 331 are probably know nothing about MCU. Probably most of them are DC fans 😂😂
React to How To Train Your Dragon 3
Those 331 must be some bunch of morons. Like damn.
Sorry George, but people don't judge movies on how much they wanna get in Chris Pratt and RDJ's pants usually.
There is no right answer. 
Don't tell people their tastes are wrong.
Like, fucking ever...
1 like for ant man and dr.strange  to be racked
This list is really stupid first of all, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 should not be on this list, it wasn’t bad but I did not think it was better than Doctor Strange and even Ant Man. Half  of these people do not know what they are talking about, and number 1 was so predictable and half of the people even said it’s overhyped... so how tf is it #1? I’m done
Who are these 331 people? What are these list? What!?
Before Endgame the best 2 MCU movies are the ones directed by the Russo Brothers (Winter Soldier and Infinity War), there is no discussion.
Personally I think The Avengers and Iron Man are next.

And this list is just nonsense.
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
8:07 He's telling facts.
These list make me question everything
I like how the old guy who knew absolutely nothing got the most points
7:52 marvel fans everywhere slammed their desk
Whre is dr.strange ?
Y'all forgot some movies.
I saw all of these thank god
I got 7 points
This list is bs tf
Doctor Strange is the most underrated marvel movie
rankings should've been saved only for the people who have watched all of the movies.
Civil war is number 8 how?
Imma be honest. Fuck George
Disagree 100% with this list!!!
If people think guardians was better than infinity war y’all stupid
They didn’t put Ant-Man?!! Come on! I love Ant-Man!!!
This isn't even a good ranking lol the majority of the people haven't even seen most of the movies and are just going off of hype lol
Who ranked civil war so low??? I just wanna talk
9:00 I’m done!
endgame is my personal favorite
This should have just had marvel fan reactors
This is maybe the worst ranking I’ve ever seen
I know it's not "MCU but Deadpool was/is the best Marvel movie. I haven't seen Endgame yet.
I'm sorry but this list is wrong
YESSSSSSSS!!!! WAKANDA NUMBA 1!!! but endgame was one of the best. Definitely
Should’ve gotten 3000 people to rank the movies :’)
Endgame
Dr. Srange no love
Winter Soldier at #9? Y'all trippin. Amazing story and amazing fightscenes!
Is it weird that my favorite Marvel movie is Captain Marvel?
This is the worst shit ever
What is that
Yall wrong
I still cry every time I see Ironman on screen.
This is so wrong damn
Fucking crap 331 people they don't know shit about marvel
Cast me I'm good at these
I got 11 like jeez
Marvels visual effects are literally the best in the whole cinematic universe
Ya'll are fools. What is that list ?!?!? Winter soldier is top 3 for sure! It made cap cool ! Gave us the Russo brothers. set up Civil war. come on
Jim doesn't think Infinity War is very good? Well Jim if you know anything about movies like you say you do then you would be giving conflicting statements there buddy because it is a great movie and it was pulled off beautifully in a masterfully way from the writing, the cinematography, the action, the different arcs, and the final few minutes?? Like bruh, how? That doesn't make sense to me 🤷‍♂️
I just got two points... well I’m gonna rewatch all of them from now on 📖
Avengers trailer:there was an idea
Avengers infinity war trailer:there was an idea
There is no marvel movie that lacks comedy Whalen 3:26
rip dr strange😢
That's the most fucked up list of Marvel movies I've seen; and I've seen a lot of em.
Blade was also a marvel movie.
The fact the cool old guy who admitted not knowing jack shit about the Marvel movies got the most correct is beautifully ironic.. Shows how the FBE team are just Marvel hype beasts loool
Wow that Aiko girl is really pretty
I’ve never seen a list so wrong in my life
So. Much. Frustration. You guys arent ranking based on majority. You guys are ranking bases on your personal (and mostly wrong) opinions. Js.
To be honest the actually list is pretty inaccurate
How is winter soldier number 9 ??
Homecoming is the worst out of all of them
IF YOU THINK IM GOING TO WATCH 331 PEOPLE RANK THEIR FAVORITE MCU MOVIES

You would be correct 
what am I doing with my life
1. Avengers
2. Iron Man 2
3. Iron Man 3
4. Iron Man 1
5. Infinity War
6. Thor Ragnarok
7. End Game
8. Civil War
9. Guardians of the Galaxy
10. Spider-Man Homecoming
Everybody who played, drop your points; I got 7
Am i the only one waiting for the doctor strange trailer 🥺💔
Why'd they all put ragnarok so low???
Deadpool??
My favorite is george the reactor
Yeeeeeeeeet
Roger is the best 💖🌷🥺
I got 7, 8, 9, and 10 right but all the others swapped.
Roger's a legend.
Another idea I have is that they have to guess the top rated marvel or whatever movies rotten tomatoes
love tony 3000
0:30 she has not seen a single mcu movie
That moment when someone puts iron man at number 2
Elders reacted to “Guess Top Box Office Grosses”
Dc is trash at making movies
Mr. stark I don't feel so good

your fine kid

Mr stark I don't wanna go no no no  I don't wanna go
Jim knows what’s up!!!
Iron men dies in endgame oops
Spiderman will always be number one in my mind 😻😄
331 morons voted for this list it seems
infinity war is amazing
Ragnarok or infinity war
This list is so bad that old man got the highest point....
spider-man is my favorite superhero ( don’t come for me)
guardians is number 1 always
Ragnarok and guardians 2 were my favorites
I thought it was RANKING ALL 22 mcu movies.... Its another top 10 ranking...
Just me or should George never come back to this show he kinda gave me a brain tumor
1st: Infinty war, it broke the rules of any plot armour settled in previous MCU Films and the pace was excellent 
2nd: Winter soldier, Great story around many characters and the Shield origins story is interesting (+ the soundtrack)
3rd: Guardians : A welcome breath of fresh air highly needed for the MCU
For sure this is 300% wrong
“It was THE biggest thing last year”
WRONG
Why is winter soldier #9
1.Endgame 
2.Infinity War 
3.Thor
4.Thor Ragnarok
5.Spider-Man Homecoming 
6.Iron man 3
7.Civil War
8.Iron Man
 Panther
10.Avengers assemble
5:52 This man is my best friend 6:20 This man should die
How about doctor strange?
Doesn’t everyone just love old people
exCUSE me THOR Ragnarok is the GREATEST gift to Marvel fans
This list was fucking shit
This list is a pile of crap. Seriously.
ENDGAME IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME

CHANGE MY MIND
pickachu dies in endgame
Winter soldier as a film is definitely the best in the mcu
I'm going to be real with you chief, that line up is trash.
I'm sorry. This is an OPINION which means there is no correct order of great movies
How can some of you not have seen or liked the best MCU movie of all time?! The Winter Soldier is #1 forever!
What is Killmonger doing there?
Terrible list winter soldier and civil war are probably the greatest marvel movies ever made those 2 movies should be at least top 3
Spiderman over Winter Soldier? C’mon
Wack ass list
I'm confused. How is there a "correct" order for the marvel movies? Your favorite movies are a subjective opinion and there is no "correct" order.
Paused the video once I saw winter soldier at 8, are you serious!? That's the best MCU movie, as thanos would say "perfectly balanced ".
this list is pretty bad
Winter soldier is my favorite
The old man is the definition of the people who made this list, confused.
Thor Ragnarok is my favorite
I LOVE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY
There’s so many things wrong whit this list
Endgame was like the Superbowl if it was done right.
Who decided to put guardians of the galaxy volume 2 at number 10 it made a lot of money it's first opening weekend like.... 😢😢😢
Who the hell did they interview for this list? DC fans?
Who ever agreed on this list is on drugs like gotg was 2nd and infinity war was 3rd.
6
Winter soldier and civil war at 8 and 9? Wtf is that allowed?
What!?Who made this list?
I can't believe infinity war is at number 3! Weird flex but not okay!
I love roger
3:58 get this dude off my screen
“a lot of marvel movies can be a little bit dark”

The fuck? They’re made for kids.
This list is so wack
11:53 Thank you. Yes that movie got overhyped. Not that it bad though.
They showed like 20 people!! 331?
"i'm going to put this at number 8. I feel like-
'YOUR CHILDHOOD BED IS A PIKACHU BED. COINCIDENCE.'
-it deserves it, you know?"
Whenever the reactors are talking I always imagine the people behind the cameras just smiling and nodding...
What a bunch of a holes 🙄
My top 5

Endgame 
Civil War
Infinity War
Winter Soldier
Avengers
13:01 You can’t start getting in to marvel after you seen end game .. that’s like watching a t.v and liking it cause you seen the series finale🤷🏽‍♀️ & plus this movie was overhyped , it’s not even better than infinity war😭
7:44 when you get out of bed and step on a lego
where was ant-man and doctor strange?¿
Infinity war at 3? Tf?
WHERE WAS ANT MAN?!
How did the old guy beat all these people who were born in the phase of the MCU
"Marvel movies are sometimes to dark" ok
Why isn't captain marvel in the list?
Everyone isn't a fan but me.
Can we get George out of video please
7:44 wtf was that?! Lmao
This list is wack
Do generations react to ava.stories on Instagram.

6:23 time out
This list is kinda weird, not sure what kind of fans voted on it
This list was shit
How is doctor strange not on here
This list is so fucking bad
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
I mean I'm glad Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok ranked high since they're my two favorite Marvel movies but y'all really did Winter Soldier wrong.
I got 9
LEEETTTSSSS GOOO!!
Guardians of the Galaxy is THE BEST!
Batman eats all the infinity stones and dies in endgame
5:07, what a fucking special snowflake, cant you say this about every superhero movie?
Every one dies in endgame
8 points
You know nothing FBE.
1:14 “save it for comic con”
I got 4 right
Britney is a playa
They should have put ant-man into this video
12:14 of course he won. I guessed from the beginning because some people haven’t watched many marvel movies and they would be persuaded by the trailers like him. The trailers also could’ve changed how much they enjoyed the movie.
That was the worst Top 10 list I've seen... Must have been compiled by 331 casual fans.
Every one is Commenting right now LOL
Every one is Commenting right now
Cilvil war is my favorite marvel moive#teamcapforlife
What the hell is the list bro!?!?!?
Did this doud said ragnarok means notjing to marvel fans
How are you going to have the BEST Marvel movie at number 9?
Let me guess, the most recent ones are the most popular.
CIVIL WAR I WATCG THAT SHIT ABOUT 10 times
They did civil war dirty
Winter Soldier is by far my favorite. It's just so freaking good. Definitely deserves to at least be higher on this list.
I'm sure most of those fbe member has hardly any idea about marvel movies. I'm sorry but for every MCU fans, that list is a garbage.
Well that was my second choice... 
- quote of 2019!
Just wondering at 3:54 is that person a guy or girl
Guardians Ragnorock and Winter Soldier are my personal favorites
He died
ENDGAME is number 1
Iron Man will forever be my #1 marvel film.
What about ant man
Hi
Who else didn't like infinity war that much after endgame because endgame was WAYYYYYYY better
331 people rank their top 10 favorite horror movies
these fools have no taste
1. Endgame, Infinity War (Seriously can't choose)
2. Civil War
3. Ragnarok
4. Winter Soldier
5. Guardians of the Galaxy
Can you guys have YouTubers react to all fatalities in mortal kombat 11 please
9:35 damn grandpa spoilin it lmao
Spiderman homecoming was trash
What is the list based on???
Iron man 3 is my favorite. I feel like the only one that liked that movie
Wtf is that thing at 01:00
This is very wrong.
12:50 well that was my second choice💀😂
7:14 You look like shuri
1. Winter Soldier 
2. Guardians of the Galaxy 
3. Endgame 
4. Thor Ragnorok 
5. Antman 
(I’d put Logan and Deadpool in there too if we weren’t talking about this series)
I thought CBR and Screen Rant was buill shit
imo


1. endgame
2. infinity war
3. captain marvel
4. homecoming
5. thor ragnarok
6. civil war
7. guardians of the galaxy (vol. 2)
8. antman and the wasp
9. dr. strange
10. pizza time
After seeing endgame I say it's the best marvel movie but in my top 3 excluding it I put 1. Thor Ragnarok 2. Guardians of the galaxy 3.Civil War
Doctor Strange is the best MCU Movie. No one can change my opinion. 




also, Batman dies in endgame :)
Th final list is Bull crap
Pls react to Steve Rogers-I'll be there
"Marvel movies can be a little bit dark" She must be confused with DC lol
react to ajr!
Couldn’t believe dr strange wasn’t there
I still need to catch up on a lot of Marvel movies, but I remember watching Iron Man when it came out in theaters, and I enjoyed it! 😁👍
Let me drop the real top 5 real quick:
1. Endgame
2. Infinity War
3. Dr. Strange
4. Civil War
5. Age of Ultron
you‘re welcome...
The rad power ranger dies
1. Guardians of galaxy 
2. Thor ragnarok
3.infinity war
4.spider man
5.civil war
6. Avengers
7.iron man
8.blwck panther 
9. Guardians of the galaxy vol2
10. Winter soldier 

In my opinion
I thought everyone agrees that civil war was THE MOST iconic marvel movie but I guess not
The End Game was the only MCU movie I have seen twice on cinema, and I’ve seen them all so it has to be the new top dog
This whole thing is complete crap what the frick
I LOVE GEORGE AND DARIUS OMG
wow what a terrible fuckin list lmao
How about you get actual people who watch the mcu to rate ?????? Just a thought
7:44 "I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again" 
Seriously tho
did i just see this guy say he hasn't seen winter soldier but he's seen endgame? That shouldn't be allowed smh.
Dora died in end game
My favourite was Age Of Ultron.
That list was not ttue
theressomanyepiccrossovers
fucking degenerate dog's thinking BP is number one lol. It's #10 if not lower
Brandon is the best man! He just brings so much joy with him!
No Doctor strange = Not a good tier list
Winter Soldier is THE BEST
George makes me doubt humanity
Imma be honest
To the people who said ENDGAME won’t be your #1 favorite you WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND 
Or you’re either a casual marvel watcher
🤦🏻‍♂️
3:16.. Nani?
My fav is the age of ultron
Im starting a Gary fan club
What is DC doing right now.. they just stopped trying, making doom patrol(butt btw) Marvels Spiderman homecoming is my favourite. Shazam and Aquaman are maybe the best in 5 years that I actually liked
"The Winter Solider" is so slept on, but we still stan all of the movies
I love the mcu franchise
no deadpool... sad...
Civil War, Iron Man, and Ragnarok should have been top 3...
This list is the definition of trash
spider-man will always be my favourite (homecoming)
No offensive but why the heck is Brittney in this vid if she doesn’t even know the MCU?! That kind off ticked me off (how she would know nothing)
Not that much people like cap hes one of the most pouplar in the mcu
Roger is jokes
Wtf is this trash list
8:59 , ummmmm
people always say iron man 1 2 or 3 was there favourite movie
Ignorance tis indeed bliss
1984
"Marvel movies are dark",she knows nothing.
There is such a difference in lists from movie goers and casual fans vs true marvel critics and diehard comic book fans.
I played along, and got 11 points!
I noticed while watching this, they all forgot about all the avengers movies(civil war, infinity war, etc)
Not including Endgame, Ragnarok is my fave!
Dang where was Doctor Strange
You do a marvel video and don't have Scott??
10:25 ..pretty much sums up the whole vid
People
Marvel movies dark 😂😂😂
I can’t stand George
that list is garbage there is no way civil war, infinity war, and avengers aren't in the top three
lol...I love how Roger had the most points. I'd totally be guessing too. I've seen a handful of all the MCU movies but at least my top favs were No. 1 and No. 2 so I'm good. :)
03:16 do you even watch marvel movies
I Love you 3000
the elderly man is me in exams
I got 8 points!!! AND ENDGAME IS MY FAVORITE!
lovw how the old dude who didnt know anything about the movies got the best score
Age of ultron is my favorite :)
My first is the first iron man.
React to Joyner Lucas devils work like if you agree
Spider man is my favorite ♥️♥️♥️
The absolute disrespect towards Infinity War is unprecedented and this coming from someone who watched BP 6 times in the movies, the movie was super good but as my dude said, it was a little overhyped.
PLEASE COLLEGE KIDS REACT TO #LOONA ‼‼‼‼‼💜💜💜💜
Wow, this is the worse list, I've seen.
Winter Soldier and Civil War so low, under Thor R
CAUTION ENDGAME SPOILERS!!
this list is trash, the distaste,,,, having tws that low 😤
Actually absurd that Endgame is already the second-best selling movie of all time. After less than 2 weeks, actually wild
The Thor trilogies are the best
Should’ve gotten 3000 people. I love you 3000😭😭😭😭
this list is terrible
Iron man dies
"I do that one just for honor of Robert Downey jr" mood

Roger is the man
WRONG. THIS LIST IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.

Can roger adopt me as his granddaughter?
Please do a reaction video on Now United's Music Videos 🙏🙏

aquaman drowns in end game
Roger had 7 points he put Iron man 4 and it was 5 soo one more point
I got 8 points! let me tell you my GASP when winter soldier was so low omg
Everyone is going to hate me for this but...







I have never seen a marvel movie.
I have guardians of the galaxy recorded tho
I wrote down my list, not what I thought people would say, and got 4 points.
By the way, I wrote my list before they had revealed the third one and I had chosen all the movies on the list a they had, just not that closely in the right order. so At least I knew what the top ten best movies were going to be.
ok they did winter soldier so dirty
How on this good, green earth did anyone think that Spider-Man Homecoming is better than Civil War AND Winter Soldier!!!😡
Endgame was SO good! Definitely my number 1
Some of the marvel movies are dark? Lol thats DC's area
The disrespect to winter soldier
You should have them watch all Stan Lee's cameos , that see if they  can remember what movie it was in.
tbh i really didn’t like guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 at all whoops,, Winter soldier should’ve been higher on the list :)
Roger won not knowing anything
Endgame was more sad then hyped
Pls react to twice fancy
Some of these are WRONGO!!!
End game is the best they are crazy

No one can replace Chris Hemsworth as Thor. He's the best 🖤
"Infinity Ward", for those elders who never die.
Can’t believe Roger 😂. W for the elders 🙌🏼
Where is Endgame??!!
I love fbe and i love almost everyone but this list was the most crappy list ever. Everything about this was wrong. You didn't even have thor. Even if you did this was the worst list ever. I am not throwing shade but this was my first big disappointment in their opinions so....yeah :/
Where is Doctor Strange?
I GOT 9 POINTS WOOHOO
So the guy who didn’t watch any of the movies got the most right😂😂😂

I've seen every one of these movies at least 10 times each and I love them all but the only trailer that gave me goosebumps (in this video) was Civil War. Such a good movie.
did Brittany just say that she hasn't seen any of the MCU movies? im so dead.. probably lives under a rock...How can  u not see any of the other MCU movies?? thats just wrong.
Homecoming above Winter Soldier and Civil War? Give me a break

Reactors Assemble!
y’all are sleeping on winter soldier omg
Cap 1: First Avenger is probably my least favourite, but the next two Cap movies are definitely far higher than the spots on that poll.  Winter Soldier is easily comparable to the best of those Mission Impossible/Bond/Bourne type political thrillers, and Civil War was just an amazing storyline with one of the best villains who’s not just some shoot first fundamentalists like Ronan or Malekith.  which is why the first Avengers with Loki should also be much higher as well.  but pew pew wins in popularity so this poll result makes sense.

Got BP!!
Shouldn't Roger have gotten 7 points?
this just makes me so emotional... I grew up with MCU - I remember seeing Iron Man with my father soon after it came out and it all began... thinking about all of it being over somehow after Endgame just... I don't know, I'm in a loss for words. I started reading the comics, too, I'm SO into the Marvel Universe and all it's characters and stories that I don't know ANYTHING else that could EVER top that. Anything.
"cute,handsome,cute" im done
what abt endgame
Wow, Ant Man and Dr. Strange should be on that list.
Play mk11
Why is dr strange not even on this list. Top 5 easy... 😒
5 points; I'm impressed with myself
THE WINTER SOLDIER SHOULD BE NUMBER ONE BYE
Well its only 331 people.. lol
In my personnal list, BP would be around 9 or 10.. and I would also include Doctor Strange in top 7 maybe. And either Winter Soldier or Guardians vol. 1 would be out in 10 and will be down to 11 or 12.
we need a dc marvel crossover it would make billions
My prediction 1)infinity war 2)winter soldier 3)iron man 4)guardians 5)ragnarok 6)BP 7)Spider-Man 8)civil war 9)Avengers 10) Guardians vol 2

My personal ranking of these 10 
1) infinity war 2)civil war 3)avengers 4)winter soldier 5)ragnarok 6)guardians vol 2 7)Spider-Man 8)iron man 9)guardians 10)BP 
Dang that list is stacked. 8 and 9 feel way too low for iron man and gotg but moving them up just doesn't feel right either. Can I have ties in my ranking?

damn winter soldier and ragnarok deserved better
This list was trash who are these 331 people because this ain’t it 😂😂

Even if you ask me to rank MCU movies 1 or 2 years later after few more new MCU movies, Winter Soldier still easily within the top 5 for me.
Tbh marvel is better than DC ✨
9:3:3 “I put it as one just in honor of Robert downey junior”
We love you 3000❤️
I am sorry but filmaking and writing cap 2 and 3, plus infinity war on Josh brolins performance alone, that's ur top 3 easy no doubt.  Then thor rag a close 4.
Winter Soldier that's going to be 3
Wait a minute it's monday that mean we can spoil the endgame bcz the ruso brother say so...

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 that's the one for me move down to number two
Thor Ragnarok number one
U should do one more when everyone has seen endgame
Teens react to homicide logic x eminem
Infinity War that's 5
The only mcu movie I like is iron man.. and the original spider-man movies but technically those aren’t part of the mcu
The first Avenger that's number 8
Ironman, Cap and Thor are my favorite avengers, I love them with my heart❤
Guardians of the Galaxy volume one number 4
5:26 “Infinity War”
“Infinity Ward?”
End Game is the Number One MCU movie.  No doubt about it.
Iron Man that's a 6
Spider-Man homecoming that's a number 9
Y’all sleeping on Taika
Iron man... Thor... Cap are my favorite avengers
Bigger than superbowl? Honey....superbowl is only big in the US not so big huh?infinity war is worldwide BIG!

3:16 Marvel movies dark? Are f*cking kidding me!!
She said not a lot of people liked Cap????? The hell?
Here's a suggestion: How about yall get people that actually watched more than 10 MCU films to rank a Top 10 MCU list. & not the kind that goes into one as a popcorn movie then be confused when Ant-Man appears.
I rather see them make their own rank then guess someone else’s
😮😮😮😮😮

Y’all are stupid for ranking Civil War and Winter Soldier so low. Civil War is my favorite MCU movie, this is total bs.

5. Guardians of the Galaxy

Wheres Dr Strange?
12/20!!! I got 10, 9 and 8 spot on and it freaked me out haha

Who are these 331 people that ranked these?!?! Winter soldier should be top 5
Four Points not bad
1.Endgame
2.Civil War
3.Infinity War
4.Winter Soilder
5.Thor Ragnarok
6.Guardians of the Galaxy 
 Panther 
8.Spider-Man Homecoming 
9.Avengers 
10.Iron Man
There's more down the road but this is my top ten
This list is tragic. Winter Soldier is a perfect movie
Rdj should have an oscar
Lmao how did Roger win he barley knew the movies lmao im dead
Well that was my 2nd choice 😂😭
Thanos is purple
FIX YOUR DAMN JACKET!
1-Thor Ragnarok
2-infinity war
3-Guardians 2
4-Dr stranger 
22-End Game (Worst movie)
Choosing a favorite MCU movie when you're a fan is like choosing a favorite child, in my opinion.  It just can't be done.  Throw in the TV shows and it becomes an even more impossible task.
No, Captain Wahmen? I guess there is no point, since it’s a top 10 list, not worst 10.
Taika Waititi is a treasure
Don't!!! Sleep!!! On!!! Dr!!! Strange!!!
1: endgame
2: civil war
3: guardians 2
4: iron man
5: thor ragnarok
Ragnarok was one of the most important movie cause this made the infinity war possible .
they arent ranking their favourite mcu films are they lmao? think someone needs to retitle this one
Who tf voted? Winter soldier is easily top 5.
Omigosh bruh...stop screaming. You’re hurting my ears (using earphones) 😑 and no I don’t want to lower the volume because I can’t hear as well. Thank you.
Avengers endgame maybe overhyped but the movie itself was really not the greatest you ever seen the Majority of it anyway. Avengers infinity war I thought was better compared to endgame I like the film but I didn’t love it. Let me also say this for people who really love endgame more power to you.
Thanos is the perfectly written villain . You can’t change my mind
Damn this was just blasphemy 😢😂😂
So y’all not going to put the hulk he had his own movie smh
Spiderman above winter soldier, Avengers and civil war 
😂😂😂
1.endgame
2.winter soldier
3.Spiderman homecoming
4.guardians of the galaxy 
5.Thor ragnorok
Some of those opinions are wrong, so I should have had 20 points, but I did get seven
I only got 2 points 😅. ENDGAME IS #1!!! IT'S THE BEST MCU MOVIE EVER!!
I got 3 spot on, 9 points in total. And I'm offended about Winter Soldier being #9. Rude.
Aiko is my new favorite reactor! 😍😍😍
This is why i prefer DC people get hypricricital and 2 basis of their choices in marvel.
No Ant-man wtf?
5.) Winter Soldier
4.) Ragnarok
3.) Guardians of the Galaxy
2.) Iron Man
1.) Endgame
Rip Stan Lee

BP is like hype viral thing on sidekick list
To the Elder reactor: You do not “grow up” out of something. You LOSE INTEREST in it. I know of adults that still watch Blue’s Clues, are planning to see the live action Dora movie or got the Spyro Reignited Trilogy because of how important said series is to them as a kid and now. It’s why I got the complete series box set of The Powerpuff Girls and spent around thirty or so dollars to get one of the covers signed by Tara Strong (Bubbles) who I have admired since I got into the show at age 13 (was 33 when this happened so I waited 20 years to meet one of my biggest idols). Also fyi most comics nowadays AREN’T FOR KIDS. So much of DC and Marvel is aimed at an older audience which actually has been the case since at least the 80’s. The youngest someone can be to get into it is 15/16 at most. I mean Rick & Morty has a comic and we all know that’s definitely not for kids.
George, that half jacket wear look is not really working. I prefer the see it the way it meant to be worn. Just a personal opinion :) Have a nice day dude!
Do a video where they have to gess the ship name of heros that would be Awesome!
I love MARVEL
Garbage taste
Ofc the most overrated movie is number 1 , just shows that people don't even care about the movie stories anymore smh.
When he said green hornet that brought back memories
1: Infinity War
2: Ragnarok
3: Winter Soldier
4: Endgame
5: GOTG
6: Avengers
7: Iron Man
8: GOTG 2
9: Antman
10: Civil War
6:57 biggest film?????
Infinity war hello idiot
Thor Ragnarok should be 2 and Winter soldier should be three!
Iron Man number 5? Blasphemy....
Dude I can't believe Batman dies in Endgame
This video is so garbage. You picked people that don't even have much knowledge about the mcu and that girl even said she doesn't watch the movies. Like wtf FBE.
React to Post Malone please
is that a guy or a girl
hell na iron man first one was best
Who else thinks that if they do a video on the MCU in the future, they should get people who are fans, not people who don't even know the characters! Even though i like Brittany, when she said that she hadn't even watched the movies, i was like, "girl, you ain't got no right to say sh*t"
Winter soldier is the best marvel movie

Holy fuck this list is so shit

Goku dies...FUCK, wrong universe

This list is sooo wrong on so many levels. 
BP doesn’t even deserve to be in TOP 10, let alon be the number one.
This list doesn’t exist to me
How do you not watch Winter soldier
People really sleep on Winter Soldier
8:59 wtf did she just say? Literally everyone loves Steve
Based off box office this all types of wrong. But can't believe Roger pulled that one out lol
My boy roger came out on top!! I’m so happy for some reason 😂
Oh my gad!
" I haven't seen any"
Me: snap
buy some decent cloth dude
iron man, avengers, winter soldier, guardians, civil war, thor ragnarok: not necessarily in that order but they are the best in the mcu
Darius Looking like Killmonger in this video 😂😂
again albino doing to much
Winter Soldier would be my one
I love all the Thor movies so ragnarok would be followed by Endgame baby
i got chills all the way up to the end man. dammit I love marvel.
Trash list
Avengers at 7???
Winter Solider at 9???
Civil War at 8 ???
as expected, Antman is so underrated :')
Ragnarok first, closely followed by Endgame.
The Winter Soldier knife flip alone is worth the #1 place tbh
React to h2o delirious
What about endgame???
I'm like Brittany, I haven't seen any of them.

I love you 3000 😔👊🏼
I got 9 points and would have had more but I second guessed myself on the last three. But great choices. but IMO Iron man should have been higher lol
Doctor strange deserve more love :(((
Played along and scored an 8. Y'all wrong for putting Guardians 1 above Guardians 2 'cause 2 was better. Also, Ragnarok was the best movie hands down.
I been watching each movie every time it came out when I was a KID. Now idgaf, lmao. Probably cuz now everybody considers themselves like a diehard fan of MARVEL, that probably start watching those movies like 3 years ago 🤦‍♂️
BP is one?!?!?
Bp is so overrated
Winter soldier and Civil war are still the best imo.
Where’s captain marvel???
Iron man 1 was best
Wtf no doctor strange???
seriously bp is no 1??!
it was most cliche and boring movie of all
This episode was so nostalgic.
3:18 apparently you haven’t seen dc. (Marvel fan here)
I have the same exact shirt the man is wearing at 2:30
no captain marvel taste has left the chat
I got 6 Thor Ragnarok is my number one
Does anyone else play along? Lol I got 5 points 😂
Awful list 👍

FBE made a type II error for this video. They need to increase power by increasing sample size
ant man and amatw not being in the top ten... the lack of taste
Should’ve done all 22 movies





Because they’re all great
Winter Soldier was the first movie I slept through.
marvel movie....D A R K ??wtf 🤣🤣
Boy George is seriously overdoing it.

Ohh wow
Hi.
can y'all stop making these videos unless you're going to do it right?? lmao how hard would it have been to get actual marvel fans
9:00 ExCuSe YoU??????!!!!!!
Endgame didn't live up to Infinity War hype. Yeah, I said it.
1. Winter Soldier 
2. Iron Man
3. Infinity War
4. Doctor Strange 
5. Endgame 

(Ragnarok and Guardians are equal runner ups)

Definitive kino ranking
SHE HASNT SEEN ANYYY?!!!!!!!! SHE HASNT SEEEENNN ANNYYYYY?!! Im lost for words.
Ummm Sam Raimi's Spider man 2 out here being the best Spider Man, you couldnt convince me otherwise. Also spiderman into the spider verse is pretty 🔥
Blade started it all
I got 7 pts didn't get alot right except one but I was really close
Thor Ragnarok is my favorite
captain marvel should’ve been on the list
Civil war make me loves marvel
If you had to watch only two it's Iron man 1 and guardians of the galaxy.
Wow did she just say she likes cap just for his looks??
Bruh, since when 3:14
5:27 i heard  infinity wart
infinity war at 3 tell them they are dreaming
3/10
i got 8 points
Bruh, Winter Soldier at 9!!! I am with Jim at 10:28 this sample size of 331 is way too small. Winter Soldier is the turning point.
Watching those trailers is so nostalgic
The last person I thought would win is the old man, IGNORANCE IS BLISS
Please  react to the whole album of Map of the Soul: Persona that just came out, it's a BOP! And also the live performance of Dionysus too, it's interesting how they take some Greek influences into their work. Each song has such a good meaning. If you do react to it us ARMYs would be very grateful. Thank you!!
The people who put the bottom 4 have terrible taste
These list are shit
You guys have no taste to put Winter Soldier at #9. Without question it's top 3.
10:57 Fact
Why not Captain Marvel as one of the Top 10?!?!?! That was a really awesome movie too. Love the girl power🦸🏻‍♀️ 💥 

I think Avengers Endgame is a really wonderful movie where all the superheroes come back together (as seen in the trailer). But I have a feeling I know why some people might not like it and NO I am not revealing spoilers to this movie 🎥🦸🏻‍♀️🦸🏼‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧝🏻‍♀️🧙🏼‍♀️
Doctor strange should legit be here
Literally watching thor ragnorak on my tv while i watch this
Winter Soldier is extremely underrated.
I liked Deadpool anyone else??
Where the Thor movies at smh
No respect for Cap or iron man….and i am not here for it……..Have some respect people...we do not derserve them
Uh, no. Iron man didn't start "it all." Blade did.
Those 331 people dosent know nothing
1:10 wakanda what
I 100% disagree with BP's placement on this list. It should've been max 7
Am I the only one who really loved Age of Ultron??
This ranking is just as bad as watchmojos ranking
too much PC
1.War of Infinity 
2. Metallic Suit Man 
3. Leader of the Soldiers Man: Internal Conflict 
4. Team Up movie from 2012
5. Team Up movie with half dead cast from 2019
Some of them have no clue about mcu. Why do u have to bring these people?
3:35 I’m so glad REACT screened the Reacters before asking the actual fans of the Marvel movies to do this segment smh
my favorite marvel movie is batman 
(yes im quirky)
Endgames already number 2 in the box office
that guy Jim 🙄🙄🙄😒
This list is a bag of turds
Unpopular opinion but doctor strange is my favorite marvel movie, then winter soldier and civil war are tied after that
I enjoyed BP, but it's not in the top 5 MCU films for me. If you take away the diversity of the film, it's not that great.
winter soldier and thor ragnarok are the BEST marvel movies.
8:58 😨 um........what the f@#k did that girl just say





Wow.
How the hell is BP in a top 10 MCU list? It was so overrated, an average movie at best.
8:59 bi wha? Excuse me that is not correct
1. Infinity War
2. Endgame
3. Civil War
4. Winter Soldier
5. Avengers (OG)
6/20!! But where’s Iron Man 2???
Roger is the mvp of this video
Marvel is the best superhero movie franchise like come on Marvel is apart of all of us
These ppl doesnt really know much about mcu huh
civil war is clearly the best
anitta
Roger got 7, one more for iron man
Anitta
Anitta
What a bunch of a holes
My Top 5 before Endgame is

1.Infinity War
2.Civil War
3.Thor Ragnorak
4.Winter Soldier
5.GOTG 2/Spider-Man Homecoming
People seriously underrating Winter Soldier, and overrating GotG Vol 2. I love that movie but it isn’t in my top 15.
How in the heck did they get that final list
why do people sleep on the winter soldier?? i agree with the guy who sells comic books tbh
BP is really overrated
Possibly unpopular opinion: The only likeable character in this episode is the older man. He's literally only one. Two or three of them were ok, but he's the only likeable one. Him and Ken.(And George and honestly just not. Like, no, how about we not for like 15 seconds.)
YESS THOR RAGNAROK #1!!!!!!!!!!
10:29 Preach it Jim .
Play Tabs
Winter Soldier at 9!


WHHAAAAATTTTT!!!!!????
They sleepin on Deadpool and Dr. Strange
Civil war and winter soldier ranking is a crime
"I'll put this one number 1 for honor of Robert Downey Jr." aw fuck me
How in the fuck did u not see winter soldier?! And then watch civil war and endgame?!
this list was ridiculous
ok we all know that the FBE staff are not marvel fans cuz this list is ridiculous lol
Haha FBE employees are lunatics if this is there too list
Captain Marvel wasn’t even on the list what a WASTE

The girl who said "people i know who didnt like avengers like this movie" is totally right. Infinity War was my very first marvel movie, going into the thesters i was complaing but i came out of the theaters loving it. So because of Infinity War, im now a huge marvel fan <3
this list is highkey disrespect
My favourite MCU movie is Doctor Strange. Something about the movie felt unique to me!
How is Civil War so low
Even the worst Marvel movies are really good
Anyone who puts Iron Man 1 under at least 3rd, is INSANE
Even the worst of the Marvel movies are still quite fun.
Can you do Kids react to TLC band?
Wait where’s Deadpool?

Iron man dies 🤗
Winter soldier is the best marvel movie change my mind

Endgame was so good that they put it all the way above this list
Ok I'm going to make one of those comments 
80% WINTER SOLDIER IS UNDERRATED 
10% Personal list
5% Marvel isnt dark 
3% Endgame Spoilers
2% Random Stuff
9:00 she’s my least favorite person in the world
7: avengers 
Me: SERIOUSLYl?!
I can do this all day…
Thank you for not showing endgame
Wakanda for every
Please make bendy and the ink machine
I cried whem the showed avenger and infinity war and brandon and I said "I can do this all day" at the same time
I hope someday for a react to World Order music videos, specially Have a Nice Day, Permanent Revolution, Singularity, In New York, and Let's Start WW3.
Came down to see if people were mad about winter soldier being at number 9. Wasn't dissappointed, really glad we appreciate it
Do adults or elders react to Joyner Lucas "Devil's Work"
I ron man dies killing thanos
“well that was my second choice” had me deadddd
Roger is out here killing it
Ayyyy 2mpontis
Rip Tony Stark
Deadpool?
I love roger
My ass is in Endgame
Rest in peace Tony Stark we love you😭😭😭❤
End Game was soooo good!
She didn’t see any marvel movies? Fu
My last name is Stark, so everyone always calls me Tony Stark.
BP wasn’t the biggest movie. IW was
@5:31 WHHHHAAAATT?!?
Their list was shit😂
That list is sooooooooo wrong
React to Qpark
the amount of disagreement that occured during this video is shocking
Endgame is amazing. You need to make a react video where they wonder what's the best MCU show like Daredevil, Defenders, and Agents of Shield.
Endgame is my new favourite
Like if Reinaldo should stay away from 13yr olds
i feel like they asked 331 random people who happened to watch the movies instead of 331 actual marvel fans
Well that there opinion
wouldnt it be terrible if robert downey jr wasnt casted as tony stark?
Just saw Endgame today, and all I gotta say is that I got my money's worth. #Marvel
Infinity War > Endgame
They should react to top favorite Marvel MCU heroes!!
I'm gonna miss Iron man aka Robert also known as Tony Stark. Like if your a true Marvel fan
Thor is BRILLIANT
The reactions to the winter soldier and ragnarok just shows how when something is too "mainstream" it attracts a lot of people who say they are in the fanbase but actually are there just for the hype.
Number one for me is Spiderman 😍😍😍
WHAT ABOUT AGE OF ULTRON?
I disagree with number 1. It would be Endgame for me.
13 points woo woo
Brittany 😍
3:18 ik this is all about the MCU but have u ever read anything DC related
I got 10 points from this!!!
Fun Fact about the "He's a friend from work" line. Chris Hemsworth (I think) went to visit a sick child for Make-a-wish or something to do with charity (I THINK), and this kid basically said this line to him and he put it in the film.
Y'all gotta start including Chelsea in these marvel videos
Does any one else miss Brooklin
Please react to Logic-Homicide ft.Eminem
7:44 What was that god forsaken screech
ragnarok is the best marvel movie, closely followed by gotg 1
WINTER SOLDIER IS EASILY THE BEST, FOLLOWED BY CIVIL WAR. THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE
1:37 yikes
fbe react to the bts performance in bbma
> eye
> Heart
> U
> Tree K
That scream surprised me
Cinema sin podcast did this when infinity war came out and they had a really good list and interesting input to go with it. Would recommend
That George kid ruins the video every time
You can buy full iron man armor for 10,000
I liked the incredible hulk
Britanny: I haven't seen any
That's jus sheer dissapointment
Wtf is wrong with you.
Winter Soldier being that low is a fucking joke. It's easily top 3.
“I think it wasn’t that big of a deal to marvel fans” ..... wait WHAAAAATTT?????
love you 331
LOVED THIS VID!! Plz do more more marvel vids💗
UK DRILL reaction
the first avengers movie is overrated imo
U wrote Spider-Man wrong in your lists. ;)
The first Iron Man would definitely be in my top 3 if not my number 1
7:12 👍
That moment when the rankers are FREAKING 331 AND NOT 330
In their previous video they changed it 🤔 ?
Batman dies in endgame and Stephen hawking saves everyone
Little did they know A rat saved the universe
0:37 YOU WHAT?!
This reminds me we need a Do They Know Marvel movies part 2
Thanos dies.
try not to cry MCU moments
3000, like if you felt that
331 people are entitled to their opinions even if they’re wrong
Like if the fbe list is so high
my top 3
3: iron man
2: infintiy war
1: winter soldier
Ignorance is bliss i am sure i heard this before!!!
Winter Soldier, Civil War, Thor the dark world, and Guardians are my favs
" interesting.. I havent seen any " uh ohh lol
When hulk dies in endgame
1 - Avengers
2 - Civil War
3 - Guardians
4 - Endgame
Please react to Dimash "SOS", "Opera 2" and "All by myself"

Roger makes me happy :0 happy old man
Hey where is the end game
7:44 ok wtf was that
331 fucking morons....no way BP is number one.  Infinity War, Ironman, Winter Soldier, Guardians 1, Avengers,  and Civil War should all be above BP.
Did my Civil War dirty
Those 331 people are mad weird imo.
I love George and I sooo agree with him about gotg
Bro the FBE Fam is High
Wow, they hired 331 idiots. That list is wrong.
11:53 This man speaks truth
The best is winter soldier
I’m a bit of an oddball. My pre-Endgame top 5 (in no particular order) would have been First Avenger, original Avengers, Ant Man, Civil War, and Ragnarok with the first Guardians, first 2 Iron Man(yes I really liked Iron Man 2) and Doctor Strange close behind.
Where the fuck is Avengers End game????
Brittany better watch them all. She's missing out.
Winter soldier... come on that is as close to a perfect movie as you get
They need new staff after this damn list
How did he watch endgame and not watch winter soldier 😫🤯
The Winter Soldier not even Top 5..... BLASPHEMY
Why would you need 330 people to run this channel. That seems like a lot of people.
If they when to the quantum realm they could go back with knowing all the answers they could have max points for “guessing”.
REACT TO AJR!!! PLS PLS PLSSS
When did Darius became so cute tho? He looks like a Rockstar!

Parents react to 6ix9ine KOODA????
Avengers end Game !!
What about Dr. Strange?????? Where u at?
When r u accepting auditions for cast :D
Seeing Jim get a lot wrong puts a smile to my face. His criticism was not good at all because he feels lime he knows everything.
12:45 except it was perfect
Its rare to see as many as 331 people chose the wrong movies as their top 10
LOL most of those movies I did not no;
Who the heck did they poll to make this list?
Who else wanted Spider-Man to be 3
Here before trending
Who’s watched all of these movies
Aquaman is the best movie
Brandon go watch winter soldier right now
Winter Soldier not top 3... Blasphemy
7:44
1:37 I love him 3000
Generations react to the very first video on Youtube
Now THIS is the most epic crossover event.
7:44 
I don't know what caption to put here😂😂😂
Watching all of the trailers through again after endgame is such an awesome trip
stop bringing clueless old people on here
Wait a damn second.
Who puts winter soldier on 8th place?
Everyone knows that TWS is the best MCU movie, trash list
Can you please remove george from this show? Thanks
Yeet
How is it possible that Deadpool didn't make the list?????
Can’t believe some of them didn’t know that people actually really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok
i was so happy to see this vid uploaded
Make all of them react to vocaloid again with different ones plsss
What about Iron Man III 😭😭
@ 12:55 when he say that “no” was his second choice to a yes or no question 😂
0:40 me too.
Yo that guy needs to calm the fuck down he's so loud for no reason
He protec

But most importantly 




He loves you 3000 bac
6:23 BLASPHEMY
y'all really put tws and cw down there........... chair, electric

4.Civil war 
5.spiderman
6.Thor ragnarock
7.Guardians of the galaxy 2
8.guardians of the galaxy1
9.Avengers
10.
I made my own list and got half of them write
Everyone likes loki
i love you 3000  you would get that its sad if you saw endgame
its a sin to have winter soldier and civil war at lower half
Trash list
Iron Man was not the OG, X-Man was around a lot longer and started Marvel characters down the path of dominating the DC movies long before Iron Man was even thought of being a movie.
Her name ain’t George
This list is piece of crap
Hey I’m early nice video btw
7:44 almost threw up 🤢🤢🤢
lol endgame was trash
dad vs thor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93lwNP1donM

😲 Huge shout out to Roger, of all people 😂, for getting the most right! 😆🎉
Batman dies
React to homicide by logic and em
Kind of low key thought Roger was gonna win at the start.
This list is horrible
wow wtf I got hella lucky and got 15 outta 20, let's gooo 😆
BRANDON WAS MY BOOOO UNTIL HE SAID THAT HE DIDNT SEE WINTER SOLDIER!!!!!!
I have never agreed with Jim more in my life.
There are definitely movies that should have made this Top 10 that didn't in my opinion.....but then again I don't 100% agree with the Top 10 pre Endgame at the box office either.
Well this is pleasantly surprising.
You should do guess the Ariana grande songs
All of the movies are the best!! Except for Dark World and Hulk
React to lil mosey
Y’all should make elders react to kids 😂 oh make them react to them reacting to a rock band that they know
Infinty War and Endgame are the ONLY good Avengers films. Winter Soldier is the best MCU film.
Y'all disrespecting ant-man tho
I JUST WATCHED ENDGAME AND ITS DA BEST!!
I WISHED they used Professor Hulk more as well, but that didn't happen. I \STILL think the movie was great.
“Marvel movies dark” you haven’t seen a DC movie right???
tell that queef to put a real shirt on jesus christ
And Spiderman will never get old old man
Am I the only one who hates the MCU😅😅😅
Thor r best I war was bad
Okay. Y'all can have your opinions about this list, but my main frustration comes from the fact that Ant Man, Ant Man and the Wasp, and Dr. Strange WERE NOT EVEN MENTIONED. Good bye.
America's ass. 
I love you 3000. 
Thor is melted ice cream. 

That is all.
WHAT?? INFINITY WAR is always nro 1! BTW, Endgame is out of top 5
My list

Thor ragnarok 
Winter soldier 
Infinity war 
Endgame
Avengers
Guardians 1
ummm Ant-man people
react to beatlemania
I forgot that spiderverse is kinda Sony property for a second and I was about to throw hands about it not being on the list LMFAO
I bet they don't even know what they are talking about this is why I hate fbe
PLEASE react to Chris Cornell!!!!
My top 3 would be:

1) Winter Soldier
2) End Game
3) Infinity War
The biggest film of 2018, infinity war came out that same year
Where the hell is Thor Dark World
Blank Panther is overrated
Real marvel stans love ant man
Winter Soldier deserves to be number 1
FBE: "So do you think most people said yes or no?"
FBE:  "Surprisingly, the majority of people said no!"
Roger: "Well that was my second choice" 
I love Roger 😂😂
This list is telling me that all 331 people are white
How can you ever miss watching any marvel movie these movies are too good to miss
Get that trans guy or girl out
what apes rated this?
DR STRANGE !!!  and IW
Winter Soldier being so low on the list just proves that people have no taste. Lol.
For people why do not want spoilers, stop F** scrolling xd
Infinity war > end game
Literally worst list

I would put iron man on top
Guardians of the galaxy is the best one I don't care what anybody says
These are objectively bad rankings.
This list gave me ligma
That doesn't look like 331 people at all.
Civil War is underrated.
1:36 should I tell her?
Thor: Ragnarok is sooo underated.
Iron man dies
1:50 This guy pisses me off
I got a perfect 0 as my score, very proud of myself.
I dont wanna sound rude or anything, only my opinion








Please dont bring that g** guy/women AGAIN!!! PLEASE im begging you, i just cant stand his personality, please for the millions of time, DONT BRING HIM EVER AGAIN.
So basically the guy who hates infinity war doesn’t understand this game that he is supposed to guess the CORRECT answer not just rank them according to his opinion
I watch end game but not infinity war like wat
The Winter Soldier isnt number 1,, these people don’t appreciate good movies,,
React to homocide logic x Eminem
why do this with people who haven't even seen the movies? means they would have voted for which ever movie they heard about most.
Imagine not watching endgame yet or also not watching any marvel movies yet fucking losers
I got 8 points
Do elders react to 21 savage
Brandon has GOT to watch Winter Soilder
One of the best movies in Marvel
I love you 3000
I bet u all never read the comics of these people dont worry no one does

The old man scores higher than them all
Winter Soldier at #9? The disrespect!!
Y no antman movies 😭😭😭
Wait! People didn’t like Infinity War?
I like the clicks and clanks the old Iron Man suit had, music to my ears🔥
how can homecoming and ragnarok are above the og avengers...?
Who else thought there was going to be 331 people in the video?
the way they disrespected winter soldier ....
Kids react to old Town road
Why is Ant-man not here? He's my favourite
12:51 hahaha second choice..
Haha iron man dies
Endgame is perfect, one of those films where the hype is real people best movie 2019 hands down.
Please react to Running Man (South Korean show)
WHO RANKED THESE? Winter Soldier got disrepected real hard.
Why is Dr.Strange not on the list 😴💀
Winter Solder.....my FAVORITE solo movie!!
So no Ant Man, no Thor "Dutch tilt" Dark world and no Iron man 3... I'm really disappointed
OK SO IN ENDGAME SOMETHONG HAPPENS
Everyone which favorite's movie isn't Guardians of the Galaxy or Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is wrong and deserves to get shot in the head
Infinity war got me back into the series.
EndGame story is stupid, so that's the last in my list. Ragnarok fare better as #1.
This whole video is shit. Every reactor dosent know shit about Marvel/ MCU. The FBE dosent know fucking anything about it threir opinions are fucking stupid, they didnt even following the rules. How the fuck is guardians and the galaxy high up? Infinity war had all of them with some of the best fights in there. Fuck all of you for not knowing your shit. Stop fucking doing videos involving Marvel.
My top 3
3:Thor Ragnarok
2:Guardians of the Galaxy 2
1:Avengers Endgame
winter soldier should be number one, no question
10) Civil War

Winter soldier so low. What de heck
My top 3 
1. Endgame
2. Infinity War 
3. Homecoming maybe or Civil War
Am I the only person who hated guardians of the Galaxy
I really thought civil war and winter soldier were going to be way up there. I love those movies, and have heard so many great things about them. I’d most definitely put endgame as number one though, it’s just so good!
this is not 300 peaple
5:25 infinity board 😂😂😂
Endgame
Interviewer: Do you think most people said that Avengers Endgame would be their new favourite Marvel movie?

Old Guy: Yes

Interviewer: Most people said no

Old Guy: Well that was my second choice
ARE THE FBE MEMBERS STUPID
Winter Soldier at number nine

"Really? Y'all are fools."

Jim is me and everybody else who loved Winter Soldier.

Me and everybody else who loved Winter Soldier is Jim.

Be like Jim.
I’m sleeping on these Gaurdian of the Galaxy movies. Gonna go watch now
The hell were 300 people smoking? All real marvel fans know winter soldier is top 3 marvel movies
My Top 5

Is it bad if I watched spiderman homecoming when I was 9? I'm 10 now and I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to watch that😂
i love your channel 3000
I tot is all marvel character movie. Only then i realise deadpool wouldnt be inside.
Brittney you fine and beautiful, but get with zeitgeist already dude!!
This list is brilliant! 🤩
Top 3 for me
1. Iron Man
2. CA-The Winter Soldier
3. Avengers Assemble
Blank Panther is good, but so overrated (better than iron man 2 though)
Wow even fbe clickbaiting us, they put all 22 mcu movies... what a lie
1.) Endgame
2.) GOTG Vol. 2
3.) Infinity War
4.) Ragnarok
5.) Homecoming
Hey it’s just been nine days it’s not been the release date of avengers endgame
>winter soldier
>9

Your staff is garbage
I got 7 points, not the best but beat the crew
This list was awful
that list is so wrong but go off
Nobody:
Me: 7:44
Wtf Those 331 people that voted are not true fans lol 😂
How was winter soldier so low it was my 2nd favourite
Do 10 best GOT battle scene
Winter soldier at #9?!??!? FBE staff clearly dont watch all the  marvel movies
That list is TRASH!!!
They didn’t let Spider-Man show up on Civil War!
How do you not even watch A SINGLE movie of MC!? That's disrespectful
that girl said Marvel movies are mostly dark??? what do you smoke girl?? Thats dc, Marvel is freaking best !!!!!!!
Thor: Ragnorak was my favorite
That girl at 8:59 actually said that not a lot of people like cap. This hurts me😔
wtf is wrong with those 331 people
This is the worst group y’all choose. Winter solder and Avengers at 9 and 7 is outright blasphemy. And doctor strange is hella slept on :(
How is winter soldier so underrated??!!
F
they really put winter soldier at #9
Alot of woke people in the staff
How haven’t you seen a single mcu movie
More like in celebration of endgame making 2 billion in 2 weeks
How is Iron man number 5😱
331 People aren't Comic Book Fans, but only Cinematic movies in general.
Wtf that list... Hahaha trash 100%
Funny cause Spiderman Homecoming was one of my below Marvel movies.
I still believe x-men 2 was one of the top 5 Marvel movies
I am very disappointed with this list
In my honest opinion, I liked Infinity War more than Endgame 🤷🏽‍♂️
Man some people have no clue do they! What a travesty of a list.
Infinity War's place is soooo wrong...
Got 9 points myself, but definitely because I based it off how I felt others ranked them, and not on my personal tastes.
These people know nothing about marvel nor film making
331 people are dead wrong.
The list is trash
YOU HAVENT SEEN ANYTHING BRITTANY?
Those 331 people have horrible taste
Age of Ultron and Ant-Man are underrated!! Or at least Ultron is...that one is really good!
Trash list
I agree more with Screen Junkies' list
Roger !! Ignorance is bliss.
Spoilers:


Buzz lightyear dies in endgame
Ignorance is blessed😂
12:55 that olden day humour still has a place in my heart
My top 7
1. Endgame 
2. Homecoming 
3. Ragnarok
4. Doctor strange 
5. Gotg vol.2 
6. Winter soldier 
7. Civil war
I just started watching but if iron man 1 is anyones top 3 im gonna judge
Wakanda forever 🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️ good list I’ll put winter soldier way up tho
Since when is guardians of the galaxy better than iron man??
331 is kind of a weird number to base this off of
Really though Guardians of the galaxy vol 1 is the best mcu film ive watch next to endgame
Is that poke that is poke
WHY THE F*** IS ANTMAN NOT ON THAT LIST?!!! IM SHOCKED! AND WEE BIT PISSED
Winter Soldier is 100% the best MCU movie
Good for you, Roger. 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
My top 10: 
1. Endgame
2. Infinity War
3. Civil War
4. GOTG Vol. 1
5. GOTG Vol. 2
6. Age of Ultron
7. Homecoming
8. Avengers
9. Winter Soldier
10. Iron Man 3
I got 6 point with my own list
Winter soldier was the best mcu movie
Who were the fools that made the list?
1) winter soldier 
2) infinity war
3) guardians of the galaxy 
4) civil war
5) age of ultron
Winter solider at 9?!! Avengers at 7?!! This must be a dream
Fck you guys I'm going to go watch Iron Man right now
I don’t have a favorite mcu movie but age of ultron will always have a special place in my heart

also damn sorry I like GOTG 2 more than the first one 

also lol again I wasn’t a huge fan of civil war, it was alright but not the best

I really like iron man 2, that has to also be one of my favs
331 people need jesus for this list
No dr strange :(
Hands down Endgame was the best movie ever
I'm mad that they didn't show the spiderman In the civil war trailer lol
These 331 people are a bit stupid
Blackwidow loki thicc
The list was so wrong
Winter Soldier is hands down the best mcu movie after EndGame
Wait no one rated captain marvel 1 right?
That list is so wrong on so many levels
Tttttttttthhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeev vvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmm
I am really disappointed in the 331 people’s choices.
Your 331 employee are fucking stupid
1 - thor ragnarok
2 - infinity war 
3 - endgame
4 - age of ultron
5 - civil war
I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one bothered about this list!
How is ant-man 1/2 not in the top 10? They were so funny
Am i the only one who thought.....WHERES DR. STRANGE
Watch it not be their favorites because of their deaths
Avengers: Endgame is indeed the best MCU movie
Winter soldier was definitely my favorite so im glad its at least in the top ten because i felt like it was slept on alot
Half of these reactors aren’t even Marvel Fans, they just in it for the hype
You need new people to work there
Infinity War is probably the best Marvel movie in terms of being a fantastic movie even detached from the rest and in it's film making and execution.
AVENGERS ENDGAME!
that list is so bad
Where doctor strange though???
"well that was my second choice" :)
1- infinity war
2- civil war
3- winter soldier 
And Endgame as the new no1
Damn captain marvel not even on this list

I liked that one too
OMG!!! Did I just hear her say no one really likes Cap?
OMG!!!!!
Alot of marvel movies can be dark. What does she think this is DC?
231 coop confirmed
Beautiful idea to have everyone react to it
HOW IS WINTER SOLDIER NOT TOP 3!!!
Winter soldier is too underrated easily one of the top 3 mcu movies..
You guys should let them react to the carpenters the ELDERLY'S !!!!!!!!!😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
wtf these people don't know anything. Clearly, Cory in the House was the biggest marvel movie of them all. The most ambitious, comedic, and badass all at the same time. They even made an anime spinoff of it!
This list is so botched
GUYS! 1. This list is opinion based
2. Your favourites arent other peoples favourites
3. Just because older movies are the foundation for other and newer movies it doesnt make them peoples favourites
4. Just because you like a movie that isnt on the list or its low on the list doesnt make the list wrong (ITS OPINION BASED)
The Winter Soldier is my fav MCU besides Endgame
1:50 This ain’t “Top 10 Marvel characters I’d like to fuck” 😂 chill dawg
This fucking list is soo wrong god dammit. Winter soldier at #9? Wtf 😂
Ewwww, guardians was sooooo meh. 
IRON MAN all the way!!!
RIP ANT-MAN
Damn Aiko out here looking gorgeous and knows marvels movies damnnnnnb 😍😫
anyways stan im3
Ragnarok is overrated
My top 5 

T1: Winter Soldier/ Infinity War
T3: Endgame/ Avengers 
5: Iron Man
I'm sry but blade started it all the first marvel movie the made it in box office and first rated R movie
Can someone help me , so there is the flash series and its the best thing ever but is there The movie its like i remember  seeing the trailer in 2015 but now it doesnt even come out on internet ?
the disrespect to winter soldier has me mad as hell
Doctor Strange 😕
I'm surprised they didn't have dr.strange in here considering it is still very relevant after endgame
Meanwhile there are 2 marvel movies that I think are better than the entire mcu. Logan and spider verse
It's sad I spent a lot of Endgame asking my son who some of them were. And got super excited to see Groot lol. Since watching Endgame I've been watching all the movies that came before it and will probably go see Endgame again once I've caught up.
the disrespect to winter soldier..phew this stinks 🤢
I got 11 points
Meanwhile, Deadpool and Deadpool 2 are by far my favorite Marvel movies
I love Endgame but the first Avengers movie will always be my favorite MCU movie
This list is made by casual fans, they don't appreciate/remember the older movies
Bro who the hell were the 331 people they asked to give them their top 10
Gotg2 is definitely not in my top 10. Why is the winter soldier so low wtf that movie was a masterpiece.
You should’ve had people rank their own top 22
Does the it matter if it's wrong? Everyone has their own opinion.
Lol. Find another group of 331 people.
12:52 that was my second choice 😂
Thor: Ragnarok?!?! More like, Bore: Ragnarok!!! Shoutout if you get that reference!
7:43 when you have sleep paralysis
How TF is Winter Soldier #9
3:18 did she seriously call marvel movies dark! Girl go check DC for that stuff🤣
Roger owns my heart he's so cute
The Winter Soldier being number 9 is disgraceful.
Justice for Dr Strange !!! This list is SHIT
6:46 This Is The One I Saw (Of course you did)
Less interested in this list since it didnt include endgame.
Nick Fury: "I understand that the council (FBE) has made a decision (this list) , but given that it's a stupid-ass decision (list), I've chosen to ignore it!".... winter soldier number 9 my arse 🙄

if we include endgame then it would be no. 1
😍😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️
God damn it

My fav is venom :(
cap: I can do this all day.
also cap: I know I know
crap list
Winter Soldier and Civil War should be higher 😂😂
Captain marvel is by far my fav marvel movie!!😍😍
I got 6 points
N-word number 1
With the Fox "x-men" films coming to a close could you rank the x-men films ahead of Dark phoenix's release?
I love you 3000
React to joker trailer
most of these people are bandwagons with no taste💀
Thor ragnarok was by far my favorite mcu movie nothing even comes close for me
0:38 did I hear that right????!!!
We STAN George omg a legend
Elders react to cannibal corpse
WHERE THE F*CK IS ENDGAME I DONT CARE IF THEY HAVENT WATCHED IT
They asked 331 toddlers
Deadpool is marvel. Wtf?
9:03 I said oh civil war at the exact same time
George does nothing at less than 100% does he?
i love mcu 3000
❤
ENDGAME WAS DAMN GOOD!
Ragnarok should not be in this list. So many thing wrong with it. The first Marvel movie that made me mad. Shame on you people, shame!
Btw I hate guardians of the galaxy
Iron man dies
I just realised that that I love all the movies so fcking much
This is the best I’ve ever done in one of these
1. Endgame
2. Thor Ragnarok
3. GOTG
4. GOTG 2
5. Spiderman
I feel so bad for the guy who didn’t see Winter Soldier but still saw Endgame. That elevator scene callback probably meant nothing to him 😩
RIP Howard Potts
“Well that was my second choice” I choked on my French fry when he said that.
Guardians of the galaxy 2 was not that good
" Oh this is the one i saw" Yeah I wonder why rolls eyes
Top 10 for me:
End Game
Infinity War
Civil War
Homecoming
Iron Man
Avengers 
Ragnarok
Dr Strange
Guardians 
Ultron (yes I liked that one)
Wow those 331 were almost spot on with my own ranking including that End game is not in the top neither for me.
Wow those 331 were almost spot on with my own ranking including that End game is not in the top neither for me.
No awence but why do you have so many 👬 on this channel
Iron man is still number one for me, always will be
Aiko lookin pretty fine 👀😋
Eh Winter Soldier and Guardians will always outrank all of the solo films for just being outside the genre and being solid films regardless of being comic book based.
I legit just came back from endgame and it was AMAZING
Omg roger is so adorable ❤️❤️❤️
Winter Soldier is the best. No doubt.
Lmao Winter Soldier at number 9? Avengers on 7?
Y'all drunk or something
Whoever says guardians 2 is better than 1 is objectively wrong. Guardians is the best movie and series
Winter Soldier at 9? No fucking way
Love this video and such a great idea :)
Should've had Dr. Strange on one of the list
damn no respect for the spider-man hyphen
endgame no. 1 for me. if it was ranked, i’ll put it as no. 1 because that movie made me feel emotions and react physically, much more than infinity war.
omg why ....????? https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=marvelcomics.htm
10:57 me 24/7 to everything and everyone😂
Let’s be honest. All 10 of these (and some not in this list) have an at least decent case for being number 1
No, not Ironman, Blade started it all for Marvel :-)
My List: 1. Infinity War
2. Guardians of the Galaxy
3. Iron Man
4. Guardians Vol 2
5. Civil War
6. Endgame
7. Thor Ragnarok
8. Doctor Strange
9. Spiderman
10. Avengers
I played along and I got the list completely right!!!!!
It was like the biggest film of last year

Infinity War: Am I a joke to you
The fact that both GotG movies made the top ten 😂 neither of those make my list. And no love for Dr. Strange, Ant-Man, and Captain Marvel? I would've put one of those movies in the top ten before either GotG movies.
These people know nothing about Marvel
my personal top 10
1. infinity war 
2. winter soldier
3. iron man 3
4. captain marvel
5. homecoming 
6. guardians of the galaxy (1)
7. civil war
8. the first avenger
9. thor 
10. the Avengers (1)
5:13 it’s a good ass movie
Did the glass guy just said that infinity war wasnt great ?!
That top 10 final list was WAAAAY off
“Oh That was my second choice.” 


Buddy there was only two choices!
Docter Strange most slept on Marvel Movie
Dr. Stranger 😢
11:29 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
BRO HE SAID THAT RAGNOROK WASNT BIG FOR THE FANS. ARE YOU SURE.
This list Is garbage. Winter soldier at 9? GTFOH!
Infinity Wars was better than Endgame
12:51 Underrated 😂😂😂
lack of the taste...
this should be a rank of the 22 movies, just so more ppl can see who´s last, and why
some of you know that whole situation
RIP Marvel

FBE “Guess the rank that 300+ people voted on”
Some Reactors “nah I’m making my own list”
Me “why are you even here?”
This list was so freaking stupid
I think Age of Ultron is better than the first Avengers
My 1 & 2 are Guardians
Ragnarok was the best
notice how the movie of you know who is not even #10
Marvel, take notes
The fact that such an average movie was number one disgusts me😂the movie was way too overhyped, and it isn’t very high on my list. But hey, opinions are opinions, even if they’re wrong
How the FUCK have you not seen a single MCU movie 😩
Łøł
What’s the name of this movie?
Infinity war
Infinity War?Gonna put it on 8..
Doctor Strange is so slept on smh
Captain Marvel not even on the list despite heavily female staff? 

FBE self-hating misogynists confirmed
These people know literally nothing about the MCU and its movies except Vivica
I would like to speak to these 331 people...
I thought 331 people were reacting in this episode. And yeah, this list is fucking awful
I played along and got 5 overall I can't believe they did Winter Solider dirty like tha
Of course they said no..then again they're wrong 😜
For me civil war was the most predictable movie out of the entire marvel movies. It left me bored threw the entire movie
Endgame is so good I'm pissed i want to see it ranked. Also it grew 2 billion at the box office and is the number 2 highest  film of all time and my theater had i diffrent screenings.
Winter soldier should be high
You should have the teens/adults/or college kids react to Marina "Love + Fear" new album!!!
The point list is completely wrong..
Tbh everyone just listed the movies in their opinion
12:40 Exactly! She knows, End Game it's not a bad movie it's great, but... let's be honest it could've been so much better and it could've been perfect
Brandon 🤮
This us why California is a shit hole.
Dumb people
Dumber government
captain marvel, doctor strange and ant man deserved to be on that list
Noobmaster69
DEADPOOL IS #1 😛😛😛😛😛❤❤🖤🖤🖤🖤❤❤❤❤❤
THIS WHOLE LIST IS WRONG
I don't know why I'm SO delighted that the young folks knew enough of the soundtrack of Guardians to sing along with it. I guess it's because that's the music I grew up to.

Oh... And Endgame ends with a credits roll... Probably... I haven't seen it yet. So... Did I spoil anything? :-D
Mom beats the kids with a whooping 8pts, kids 1 pt each.
This is honestly the worst list ever made
REACT ANITTA - VENENO
Kids react to X Japan plz!!!!!
React ANITTA - VENENO
Wow my own list is sooooo way off ^^
they really did winter soldier dirty like that smh
winter soldier is in the top 3 and thor ragnarok deserved a n.2
Sami Rami's spiderman 2 is the best marvel movie ever
Calm down y’all, my fellow MCU fans, they’re just filling in their opinions and shtick. I loved all of the movies since day one ⚔️⚔️👏👏👏.
Captain Marvel and Dr Strange are better than most of the Top 10
1. Infinity War
2. Guardians 1 
3. Endgame
4. Winter Soldier 
5. Guardians 2
6. Ragnorok
7. Iron Man
8. Civil war 
9. Homecoming 
10. Iron Man 3 (so underrated) 

But overall anything MCU #1. Daredevil
According to fucking who
Winter Soldier being 9 is many many types of wrong.
Rong
G.o.G dead dust dust dust survived
why is spiderman on the bloody list
Endgame was good but not the best. Poor iron man
The ranking is so wrong, taste in the ass
90% of the comments= How wrong tge list they made
10% of the comments= Why endgame isn't included in this list.
This list is pretty ass
Opinion: Thor Ragnarok was the worst Thor movie.
“Well that was my second choice” 12:54 😂😂
1. Blade. 
2. Loki
3. Thor
4. Antman
5. Captain Marvel 
6. Ghost
7. Whistler's Daughter
8. Rocket
9. Ironman
10. Back Panther
What about captain marvel!
Y’all should’ve just made the list by IMDB ratings
Gonna have to be honest here, I stopped watching the video halfway through because I can't stand the over the top personality of George
Yeeeeaaahhhh-
Trash list
And stop having George
Roger won hahahahaha go Roger
7:44 what the frick
WHO THE HELL PUT AVENGERS, CIVIL WAR AND WINTER SOLDIER BELOW SPIDER-MAN
How tf—
The people that ranked the movies are idiots
What about age of ultron???
Bro if they had the chance to pick Thor the dark world and age of ultron on the list it would be number one cause they like bad movies
I think as an individual movie endgame is not the best, but as the ending of this saga i think endgame is almost a miracle.
To whomever made this list


I just wanna talk
How is spiderman homecoming over winter soldier and civil war 😭😭💀
This list is just completely wrong
Can't FATHOM how Winter Soldier was so low! But I'm happy and shocked BP was NUMERO UNO!!! #WakandaForever
Loved Gary and Rodger 



 But FBE your list is way off
I dont want to be mean but that guy George makes me uncomfortable
Generations react to The Hillywood Show!!!!!
I don't understand the love for Guardians 2...it was funny sure, but the story was SO bad.
9:22 no one did like their boys fighting
You guys have shit taste.
I have never seen a worse list
how can't you put avengers on top 3
Try not to get mad when someone explains the end of END GAME
Guardians of the Galaxy making top 2, insert meme: I’m so proud of this community.
The fact that Civil War is so low shows how little the FBE "family" knows about film. Anything less than top 3 is an insult in my opinion
Roger looking just like Quagmire
The disrespect to Winter Soldier 🤨
how is Winter soldier not in the top 5?
No way in HELL CA:The Winter Soldier is number 9 bro. That movie was a fuckin masterpiece. It’s still my #1 even after Endgame.
Infinity was better than Endgame. Change my mind.
how does Marvel manage to always hire hot people
I love fbe
How is winter soldier at number 8?
Winter Soldier should of been at least the top 5
7:42 what the fuck
I got ten nine and eight spot on but the rest were a mess🤦🏻‍♀️😂
8:59 you're wrong lady
6:45 of course u did thats why the movie is overrated
331 people are idiots
I think Guardians Volume 1 is my favorite out of all the movies. I just can't help but to love all the characters although Volume 2 hit me in the feels more. I feel a call to adventure in both movies which I live for.
My Marvel top 10 list:
1. Avengers: Endgame
2. Avengers: Endgame
3. Avengers: Endgame
4. Avengers: Endgame
5. Avengers: Endgame
6. Avengers: Endgame
7. Avengers: Endgame
8. Avengers: Endgame
9. Avengers: Endgame
10. Avengers: Endgame
Wow roger I’m impressed
Top 5
1. Endgame- perfect movie
2. Infinity War
3. Thor: Ragnarok
4. Civil War
5. Thor: The Dark World (lol jk either one of the Guardians movies or Spiderman)
How are all these people commenting the list's were shit. THE VIDEO JUST CAME OUT YOU AINT FINISHED SHIT
Omg Roger got the most points!!!
Too many people get upset with movie opinions, beyond the fact that opinions are subjective - I think it would get boring if lists were the same all the time and people agreed just to fit in, due to the disingenuous nature of that. They're just movies, I don't think it's a big deal.
Ones automatically gonna be spoiled for you there’s no way of escaping it,
Would you rather someone to spoil Avengers Endgame or every episode in season 8 Game Of Thrones?   Pick One 
my pick would be endgame
When the old man got the highest score. Lol
Winter Soldier
Nuff said
Where's Captain Marvel???
Yo they got Jcole to shave
Damn almost no one appreciates Winter Soldier😱
I'm slightly offended
Wrong. This is just wrong.
331
I got 10 points!
That was an awful list lol
This makes me stupidly nostalgic 😭
Why is the First Avenger not on this list!!
My guy trying to make his opinion matter but yet
he hasn’t seen the winter soldier
U can’t rate them when they are all badass ? 😂
Roger is the GOAT
number 1 Howard the duck
I love how Rodger is so chill and apparently a genius, using the knowledge of ignorance as a power somehow. He brings all-new meaning to the saying "old and wise", and he's tapped into wisdom powers my feeble mind can't even fathom.
Wait wtf is this list
Aqua man drovens in endgame
Between Thor Ragnarok and Ant-man and the wasp I don’t know which one make me laugh more
this list is dog its completely wrong
I love you 3000
....😎😎😎
Endgame is the best movie ever no matter what you say ❤️❤️❤️🥰😘😍
6:54 eeeee Infinity War also dropped last year
This list is upsetting.
I really don’t understand the people the 331 people that voted for their top 10

They shouldnt have polled people that havent seen all the movies
Ragnorak is actually objectively the best one
Winter soldier is the best marvel movie
#RDJFOROSCAR!!!
People who haven't watched all the movies shouldn't get the right to rank them.
iron man's series
The original Iron Man is my favorite movie period
Terrible list.
Endgame is good but nothing will beat those scenes on titan in infinity war for me
everyone: OG AVENGERS IS THE BEST
infinity war: Hold My Infinity Stones
"if it's not blink**blink*blink perfect, people are not going to like it".
the winter soldier is 100% no. 1
Stupid list
Endgame is my favorite and guardians 2 is my second favorite.
My favorite is Endgame, Civil War, Winter Soilder, and Infinity War
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is my fave
Marvel Forever
I got 9 points that is the best i have ever done on these types of quizzes.
I have to be honest, Infinity War was an okay film and it had massive hype, but the first Avengers film was better than Infinity War.


Top 3 (regarding the list in the video) should be:


1. Avengers 1 or Civil War
2. Avengers 1 or Civil War
3. Iron Man or BP or Winter Soldier
12:50 I love this man
That might be the worst list I’ve ever seen
7:45 i thought that scream was from the movie😂
Roger is the best in this video, change my mind
Ironman is the best
This list is awful, in my opinion.
This shouldn’t be a video, all marvel movies is number 1. Simple.
Old man knows his stuff
How are these rated?
no die
The girl who said Guardians Vol. 2 was better than 1 needs to stop watching marvel movies.
To be completely honest, Endgame isn’t my favorite marvel movie. I watched it for the first time and I thought it was a little slow at first. I think it could be because I was anxious. Rewatched it a few times since and it went by faster but it’s still definitely not my favorite
You guys should react to : I am iron Man.
Winter Soldier deserves way better
"I like him for his looks, and that's about it" -_-
I have respect for all these people but this list is completely wrong cuz they should all be at #1
This is a terrible video
I like all the 331 people
5:12
As a Marvel fan, this is hard to watch at ..
You are so dumm
I can't believe none of them got goosebumps by hearing the avengers theme music... That shit ALWAYS gives me goosebumps
infinity war was better than end game
This list is horrible. Who the hell did they ask? A bunch of local casuals?
7:44 what the hell
yeah endgame was pretty ass
Captain marvel better be close to last. It was so boring
this list is f-ed up
Even them agreed that bp is overrated
50 Spiderman's?
Girl u trippin,
6:00 "He's a friend from work" was improvised. A kid from Make A Wish went to the studio and asked Hemsworth to include it and he actually said it.
No Ant Man on this list so these ratings mean nothing
endgame was/is by far overhyped, it's nice, but infinity war was better
Who's the drag queen
How does one never watch a Marvel movie???
What t f r the old ppls doin here🤣😂
N Y the fck venom is not there🤔
0:24 Kristen is bad af
Ragnarok is the best Thor movie please people what’s wrong with you
10. You 9. Can't 8. Rank 7. MCU 6. Movies 5. They 4. Are 3.All 2. Great 1. Endgame
I generally don't think the OG movies get the recognition they deserve, apart from Iron Man. If the original movies hadn't worked we wouldn't be as invested as we are. BP should not be number 1.

Yo, FBE. Please do not bring people like George to these kinds of episodes. Don’t forget, a lot of childeren watching This too
I got 9 points! Lets go I beat everyone :)
I’m trying to rate them to but every time one comes up I’m like ‘I’ll put it at number one’ 😹 I can’t rate them all number one 🤔😬
LMAO this list
Also can we acknowledge that bruh said BP was the biggest movie of 2018??
I love this a lot!
Top 3
1. Deadpool
2. Guardians of the galaxy vol 1
3. Endgame
That list is such bs. I'm pretty sure the kids made it like this bc they don't know shit abt marvel
How the hell did Roger win? lol
Can you just stop with people like george
Also after fully watching it, most of these people are not qualified to rank these movies
Roger is so sweet
the winter soldier is number 9???? I see these people lack TASTE
Love you guys fbe
Screen Junkies Universe has the definitive list of all 22 films if anyone is interested
Infinity War should have easily won. Last 2 marvel movies are by far the best of all.
George is a constant mood
I see all these people ranking all the movies and I honestly couldn't! I know my top 5 but in no specific order Avengers, GoTG, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier and Captain Marvel. The bottom 2 are Incredible Hulk and Doctor Strange.
Avengers Endgame Spoilers here lol:
In my personal opinion Endgame wasn’t that good.
My top three:
1. Thor: Ragnarok 
2. Infinity War
3. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1
Everyone at FBE is garbage, but I've known for years now so I'm not surprised.
Y'all shouldnt even rank them and say that ones better than the other if it's marvel its a good movie
60 to watch
Wow
I think they just went to rotten tomatoes.
"Marvel movies can be a little dark" uh that aint marvel
My top 5
1. Civil War
2. Ragnarok
3. Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2
4. Blackpanther
5. Homecoming
3:46 Please dont invite this moron here. He's a man, not a women. #stopLGBT

The winter soldier will always be my number 1 as far as stand alones but as far as the avengers go endgame is numero uno

Thor: Ragnarok, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Guardians of the Galaxy, higher than The Winter Soldier? I’m disappointed, but not surprised.
We all love Iron Man 3000
"I'm Mary Poppins y'all!!!" one of the best series of lines in the franchise :P (but didn't like Ego as the villain)
Though I liked Doctor Strange more than many of these :)
Aiko is so pretty ♥️ she reminds me of camila mendes
hi
doctor strange isn't on the list? wtf?
ok so obviously the people at FBE know nothing about Marvel
5:27 What's it called?  Infinity Board?
Wonder woman number 1 period
WHERES DOCTOR STRANGE?! ITS SO GOOD
Yessss I live for the marvel content
This list is WAY off.... 😶
Winter soldier and civil war should be way higher.
Thor Ragnarok will always be my #1
winter soldier deserves better
Old man says who dies in endgame 😂
Wait.... Her daughter!?
How is winter soldier 9
Omg where tf is iron man 2

Generations react to Slayer
People I don't know or care about 😴
Brandon is just so amazing honestly can we just take a moment?
I like the old man haha
Your staff doesn’t have good taste in movies
This list is interesting
Iron Man is SOOOOO OVERRATED
Bucky deserved better
The best marvel movie is homecoming dont @ me
Where’s Doctor Strange at??
This is awesome
These people have bad taste lol
My top 3 
3.Endgame
2.infinity war
1.cap civil war
6:54 dude forgot infinity war
I literally just finished endgame and wow  am I obsessed 😂
The guy that hasn't seen any of em got the most points lol. What could that possibly mean?
Excuse me, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 at 10?!
Oh shit this is a recent video
In what universe is guardians of the galaxy better than ragnarok?
List made by casual movie viewers  and not marvel fans. Civil war,  winter soildier and avengers on thd bottom
WINTER SOLDIER is the BEST MARVEL MOVIE. Don't @ Me
The best spider man was with Tobey Maguire
this list is troll
I still didn’t see Endgame😩
Am I the only one that thought infinity war was just alright
1,2,3 and 10 were the obvious ones if you ask me...who the heck even liked Guardians 2? How could anyone even watch that movie 5 times? Really? It was my biggest disappointment in the MCU.
What about my man doctor Steven strange
George makes me wanna die
I'm sorry but that guy at 3:57 HAS to go
This list is trash
WHY ISNT THE FIRST AVENGER ON THIS LIST!!!!
I love how FBE ignores on doing a video about Lil Peep  :)
endgame didn't even begin to touch most of the movies on the list they created
That's a fked up list!
So.... What was difficult to choose nr one?
React to DCI and WGI shows
I'm so pissed off that spider man homecoming was ranked higher then the original Iron Man film.
Love these videos! Would love a shout out to ReiLuna(rayLuna) and Matt
Teens react to that  birth contractions simulator thingy for mother's day.
But I still don't agree with the list though
Please react to the “He said:   ” “She said:   ” meme pleeeeease
I got 11 points I’m shook. 5 of them spot on and had ragnarok at 5 instead of 5.
ragnarok over civil war??? civil war is a top 3 movie
1. Iron man
2. Infinity war
3. Dr strange
4. Endgame
5. Guardians of the galaxy
6. Winter soldier
7. Ragnarok
8. Avengers
9. Guardians 2
10. Ant man
My Top 3:
1. Endgame
2. Civil War
3. Iron Man 2 (for the character development)
I clicked so fast hoping that Endgame would be included since the graphic clearly says all 22 films and then was immediately disappointed.Damn Brandon how have you not seen Winter Soldier?? It deserves to be way higher and definitely above Spider-Man.
I got 7 which is pretty good for me 😂💃💃
Who else wants to punch that guy wearing a tank top?
My favorite is endgame
Here before 20k views
I love this channel also early
Contrary to popular opinion I thought Endgame was not as good a film as everyone thinks, I give it a 9.0 out of 10 honestly.
I am





Disgusted
College kids react to Monsta X
I mean, Endgame is good..... but SOOOOO long.... The thing is, it all serves a purpose and can't be cut down anywhere.... I loved it though and can't wait for release of blu ray
1.Infinity War
2.Civil War
3.Endgame
This list is trash
Teens meet billie eilish

Terrible list
This video is just like Infinity War, I spent the whole thing screaming WHERES ANT MAN
Of course the afro girl hasn't seen any
331 People don't know what they are talking about!
Don’t press read more unless you watched endgame




I’m so sad Iron Man died
React to Samsung phone
how can the winter soldier be in 9???
That list is absolutely fucked if Winter Soldier is at 9

This list is so wrong on so many levels. SMH.
"I haven't seen any."

Girl you better be lying, cause we're gonna have some beef if you telling the truth
When you see endgame you’ll put it as number 1 trust me. Those saying that it wouldn’t be their new number 1 are just people who don’t believe that marvel can top their greatest movies. But they did 😂
7:44 is that a dinosaur
Is it bad that I've only seen one of those movies...
React to Carrie underwood

Wtf Winter soldier at 9
My top three:

3. Doctor Strange
4. Doctor Strange
5. Doctor Strange
6. Doctor Strange
7. Doctor Strange
8. Doctor Strange
9. Doctor Strange
10. Doctor Strange in Infinity War
Panther was waaaaaay too over hyped the summary of the movie is just wakanda forever, I think winter soldier should be number 1
Hi FBE.
All the Russo brothers' and Gunn made it in the top 10; best directors in the MCU!!!!
6:21 *Oof just Oof-
2:05 Yes they do, especially after Endgame.
Sprinkles the Ogre comes back in Endgame
I expected iron man to be #1
It says 331 people, but 10 people are here.
I bet winter soldier or infinity is war #1

Edit: something isn’t right
Yeet
FBE, have the Teens react to  and meet Sabrina Carpenter!
Winter soldier in top 9?!?! REALLY?
worst ever
literally who the fuck made this list.
6:21 SHUT THE FUCK UP!
i don't trust anyone who doesn't put the winter soldier or ragnarok in the top 5
Winter Solider is #1
So I’m guessing those 331 people are those type of people who watch movies for the visuals?

Carson looks kind of like Spiderman
YeEt yEeT yeEt YEET.
7:10 *does it the wrong direction "This does nothing."
This doesn't make sense.. they are TRYING not to try...
OMG! I'm twelve, and I know he's fifteen, but Jaxon in so frickin adorable!!!!
Shit Le'Raun you look like 20
Man I was eating during this video, I wouldn’t suggest doing the same XD
That hair straighter brush, my mom has that lol
Jaxson:doesn’t fry your hair my a**
I need that  the ear one ya
Troy kinda sounds like Tufe
I've been wanting that ear thingie since 2016 😭😭
react to I don't care by ed shearen and jb
Commercial:how do beauty queens, celebrities,and models look this this? Wanna know there secret
Me: plastic surgery
But when in your life will you accidentally sit on an egg
This is such a stupid concept. The whole appeal of the video is seeing them react to trying it. The try to not to try challenge may as well be the try not to make a video challenge.
07:10 that is the wrong way :v
04:32
Am i a joke to you?
7:16 NEXT MEME
Is it just me or do they use the rooster sound from Ocarina of Time in so much stuff? I know that's probably not where it's originally from, but I always think of that.
8:21 waistlines snatched for the gods
.that is not healthy.
That is not healthy
Jaxon: What the hell is that!? THAT IS NOT HEALTHY!

ALSO JAXON: being model for the seconds
12:45 
Made me crack up😂
Half of this stuff wants to make me puke..
8:26 "beauty will be mine" wyd boi😂👌
Kristen Hampton did a Product Test Tuesday of the egg sitter cushion months ago. It was awesome. She sat on a whole bunch of eggs without them breaking.
6:41, she sounds like she is about to cry
This one is so funny🤣🤣
4:31 doesn’t fry your hair my ass 😂😂
3:40 straighting hair with the back of the brush?
It's crazy how I already have the straightener brush😂😂😂💀
With the sock slider you need to bend down anyway to put on your shoes
I remember when I was little I always wanted the trash on as seen on tv stuff like the snackies cup or something
aweeee i luv jaxon and thomas
I remember when some of them were on kids react
thomas is so funny in this vid
Proof that some of these are acually scams
Im so weird but Jaxon gives me Teen Wolf Stiles vibes
I actually bought the Smart Swab😅😂, it's actually a really good product I like a lot
Elders react to Kendrick Lamar DAMN album!! Lyric breakdown too!!
I subscribe love you ❤️
Hi my name is Angie I have been watching your YouTube videos since I was 5 years old and now I am 10 years old
It literally only worked for Carson 😂
Before I start watching I'm gonna guess how many of these I actually have. 
My guess is 3
Edit: I have a pore vacuum but it's not the dermasuction. They're great but they will leave hickies if you use it for too long on an area
Edit 2: I have a missbelt but I also have a bad back and normal back braces either don't work or are too big for me so I use it as a back brace.
Edit three: so technically I have two of what they showed. I'm counting my pore vacuum even though it's a different brand but I might look into getting one of those cushions for my back
Ok so I have scoliosis so I wear a brace for 23 hour everyday sleeping and at school
13:44 he still has the waist thing!
OMG WE NEED TO SEE MIKAELAS NATURAL HAIR
From experience waist trainers hurt extremely bad if you wear them for a few hours. You get really bad stomach pains.
0:23 Jordi ?
I had a smart swap for my ears. it fucking hurt
REACT TO JUSTIN AND ED IDC MUSIC VIDEO
Troy sounds like tfue, looks like tfue and talk like tfue.
I want to see Brian Shaw sit on the egg cushion (with the egg obviously)
The boys being upset about the waist trainer is truly beautiful
8:54 i cAnt breathe, i can’t- ahaha😂
8:25 "Beauty Will Be Mine"
No phil swift?
The egg sitter cushion commercial has actors. For sure. 🥚
7:10 He's rotating it the wrong way.
FBI
My brother has smart swamp!!
better product than the sock sliders? grandkids
carson to be hired as a salesman
7:16 clap clap next product!
My dad has the sock slider. It works well for him. Maybe if you really rely on something to work, you can make it work. Haha
13:11 me like if it would be you
You can sit on an egg with out breaking it no thank I don’t wanna tast someones dirty but
Jaxon is... same.
13:10 (THICC ALERT)
NEVER FALL VICTIM TO THE BRAND
Jayka and Troy are all grown up now. 😳
Smart Swab works!!!! I have it!
Oh my god Mikaela is a licensed esthetician I'm so proud of her!!
But your trying not to try
Man that makaela 😍
I really wanna try dermasuction because idc if I'm a male, but I do have so much dry skin and shit in my face.
Okay so I got depressed, cried, almost committed suicide, and ate a lot of cake. Now I'm going to throw up.

The sock thing is for older people and for pregnant women bc it's hard to bend done for pregnant women so that's kinda good
Anyone else think troy is related to tfue

People are commenting now?

Lmao when they reacted to the waist trainer or whatever it’s called made me laugh so hard
Not gonna lie but jaxon is cute!
I literally have a Simply Straight and I love it so much. I just need to regular brush my hair first.
finding out the react room is actually just a backdrop and a table is SENDING ME
That body slimmer is a modern day corset.....  and is just way too restrictive.  

I am amused that Jaxon wore it the rest of the episode though....

I wear corsets and bodices for fun, but that is usually one or two times a year.
13:11 “so squishhhyyy” 😭😭❤️
i want the egg sitter, thank u
12:48 “woAh how insAne a eGg, oN mY bUtt” 😭😂😂
I’d try everything haha 😂

Troy = TFue in discise
Okay, that fucking waist thingy. Promoting the unhealthy beauty standards for females, no!

13:11 she’s so adorable
12:45 Woah that’s insane an egg on my butt

Edit: I commented this before the other dude said it so don’t hate on me
Jason: "doesn't fry your hair my ass" 😂
Yeet/yeet/yeet/yeeeeet





lol
“Girl just do a face mask”
You know, there's a reason why women did away with corsets back in the early 20th Century. Once the brassiere was popularized, it was considered to be much better for women's health. So why are we trying to bring it back? It looks ridiculous anyway.
12:41 was the fakest thing ever😂
When he said WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!!! I choked on my ensure
Quick question, WHY WOULD YOU SIT ON AN EGG?!
The waist trainers remind me of the first day of getting my scoliosis brace.
Jaxon seguía con la faja 😂🤣🤣🤣
Those actors tho. OH WOW WHERE CAN I GET ONE OF THESE?!
you guys should react to lia
Why is Anna Reacting 
She doesn’t have eyes
This video came out on my b-day
I have the simply straight brush!!🤣🤣 it doesn't work on my hair🤣
Some of these are kinda stupid...
uh I don’t get it but ok
Who would sit on a egg anyways?
It has to be short socks
My stepmom is disabled and someone gave her those sock slider things and it had sharp edges and it cut her deeply and gave her scars
Thought It was a try not to cry challenge
I have that brush hair straightener
I love how carson got everything he tried to work lol
I have that brush iron! 😝
The sock slider, they didn't even do it right from the start, the whole sock need to be on the thing to work. Work with stuff like that so I have tryed out alot of them.
USA: "the doctor appointments can be expensive"
Canadian: cant relate 🤣
Troy sounds like Tfue
12:43 I just can't😂😂😂he should share his voice with a cartoon character or however is that called😂
At 4:07 my hair is to curly to brush.
Te not to touch food
Ew, omg omg omg 
Becca's feet. 🤢 
11:08
i think there should be a teens react to jackson wang . . .
Le'Raun's eyes are amazing
Wave Check
The only name blacker than le'Raun is lequisha
Are you going to react to eurovision again this year? I think it'd be cool if you streamed it with your fans, if your reactors have the time c:
Jaxon looks like thomas Brodie-Sangster even sound like him
The whole "try not to try" thing is so stupid
9:26 just fucking bend your legs you special people
Troy looks like tfue
Notice me jaxon!!! I just want u to know that i love u❤
Who else remembers when Jason was on kids react?
Damn the fuck happened to becca she used to be so hot now she look like a creepy japanese doll
Has anyone tired the Simply Straight thing yet??? I kinda want it
Jaxon is my favorite teen 😂😂
2:03 “BuT GiRl JuSt Do A fAcE mAsK”
Pewds reference
"you still have to put on your shoes afterwards" oof
I thought Thomas’s name was Thanos at first.
I hope Teens React check up on Lia Marie Johnson. She changed. She’s alone! plsss help her. She’s so beautiful inside and out and she has such a beautiful soul. I hope she doesn’t do anything stupid! Us fans are trying our best but we can’t change nothing. Pls check up on her!!
The egg is the best marketing trick. I mean it's great if you regulary sit on eggs.... but what does it say about this beeing good for your back?
actually. these products are usually made for disabled people (like the sock thing) but they have to market them to a broader demography to be able to sell them enough/get the word out. 

It's also why those commercials are sometimes kind of weird (randomly slapping over food platters etc,) They don't make sense when you think of it from the standpoint of an abled person, but look at it from the standpoint of a disabled person and it makes sense.
I would be like I'm not trying to not try that so I'm successfully doing the try not to try challenge😌🤷🏼‍♂️
mikaela tho mm
Who esle wanna try those things?😂
To this day we still don’t know what happened to Jaxon and he’s slim belt

R.I.P. Jaxon you will be missed 😭 ❤️🇦🇺
Becka’s skin is always popping
Carson looks like Brandon Calvillo
Next video: Try not to look at the camera !

This is dumb
Thomas 👀
Did anyone else notice they used the ear cleaner thing wrong
and there's more!!😂😂 infomercials always say this...cracks me up
FIRST




Letter of the alphabet is A
And people wonder why this earth has so much waste 🙄🙄🙄give me a break! This earth will soon become unsafe to live in because of consumerism like this. It’s not just the plastic straw u see in videos. It’s dumb fucking videos (no hate, y’all are amazing) like this that lead people into thinking they need to buy shitty asssssss products just so companies can make money.  Seriously, this video is promoting some subliminal messages, that the more things u have, the better ur life is! Which isn’t indeed true. This world is fucking corrupt.
They "tried" not to try that means they all lost
19 year old and 18 year olds are not teens
twist wrong way inside the ear “it did nothing”
Jaxon fails at placing sock on win mysterious contraption
Jaxon: Perfect!
now I am dying on the floor
Who staying up all night
1:20 I laughed out loud 😆 Same Girl~
Men's hair seem more healthier than women's tho wat-
Jaxon is probably the meme lord off cam.
DUDE I MISSED THOMAS
Jaxon:
clap**clap NEXT PRODUCT

I see what you did there 😂😂
Girl with already straight hair straightens hair “Wow it actually kinda works”😂
Jaxon your turning it the wrong way
“That is freaky hot. DOES’NT FRY YOUR HAIR MY ASS.”
Why tf does that dude sound and look like tfue
12:06 The color of the nails changed
I wear spanx
Your spinning the ear cleaner the wrong way
Mikaela looks like victoria justice
I feel like this video should be called “teenagers putting companies out of business”
K but half the people turned the earwax thing the wrong way so obviously it’s not going to work if you don’t do it properly
Fails=PERFECT
4:29 “Doesn’t fry your hair my ass!” I wheezed so hard for some reason.
8:14 I thought he was gonna say
"Because of that reason... I'm out"
Kinda like they do on Shark Tank
Jaxon's Product Review... Next 👏 Product👏
9:38 the kid with the anti vax mom
Lol "beauty.... Will  be mineeee"
BTW I tried the "simply straight" and it damaged my hair I even lost some hair

Troy is actually tfue
I always want Jaxon to like win but he always blows it
Emily literally has no life
Troy was on master chef season 1
For the boys
Everything freakin works
For girls

hahaha the difference tho
I have the straightener brush!!!!!
NO SH*T THE SMART SWAB DIDN’T WORK they were all twisting it the wrong way 😂
i miss the old teens like tori eric and more
12:53 
this could lowkey be an asmr product not even kidding
Troy looks and sounds like tfue
I like how for the second one all of the boys and 1 girl that tried it thought it worked
7:15 
Have you ever wanted to shove your intestine into your diaphragm well do we have the solution for you introducing "Miss Belt"
"You still have to put on your shoes." THAT GIRL HAS A POINT!
don't we all accidentally sit on eggs, well since that always happens they made something so it won't break. guys this is logic
Anyone see that meme review referemce
Yeeeet
Oof da
They should have provided a wig for the simply straight
"girl just do a face mask" is clear skin privilege
Ok but what is the point of sitting on an egg
Inside edition tried the egg sitter it worked with sitting on it but it didn't work with the bowl if you don't understand me search  "inside edition egg sitter"
Jaxson is still wearing the waste thing lol
Omg me :Yeet Yeet Yeet YEET
How they get their shoes on when they can't bend over 9:52

Am I the only one that didn’t know that this was just posted because I really thought so because the look and the design of the video looks like the old FBE
Anyone else know that putting qtips in your ear is dangerous and can permanently damage your hearing
The straightener works yall
like how many times they made weird faces
It would be funny if someone sit on the egg and It disappeared after standing up
I saw an arrow on the ear thing all but one went in the other direction...
Ok but what’s La’Ron @ NOW‼️

Better actors were needed for the cushion commercial, a pass on the corset thingy

And like u thought it was over then it just started back up for another 50 mins
On Kristen Hamptons ptt I loved the egg sitter so much I asked my mom to get me one for my birthday
Simply straight works and I have curly hair and it’s way better than a straightener
That waist trainer is gonna mess up your insides bad
My mom bought me the straightening brush for Christmas even though my hair is naturally so straight – like what do I use it for?? lol
"Doesn't fry your hair my ass" I lost it 😂

Hi
Jaxon with that snatched waist🤣
Rey
I wanna point out yes they r picking up trying to prove the egg isn't boiled but the video has a one sec pause so they could be switching eggs
You did it with long socks that’s why it didn’t work
Emily is that one friend thats always a partybraker
12:27 BRO YOU CAN HEAR THE EGG POP
Why get a sock slider, when you can just make other people do it for you 😂😂
Lol when they did the ear thing there was an arrow and most of them went to the wrong direction and thats why they got nothing smh
jaxon looks like roblox rethro avatar with the corset on
Emily seems like she just doesn’t want to be there
Why do they have such long socks
Jaxon got that hourglass body now

Can we just explain that Jaxon was wearing the corset for the rest of the episode😂
give me a dermasuction my blackheads have taken over my face
yeeeeee
teens React to Zayne and Zhavia "A Whole New World" Music Video
The sock aid is actually really helpful. OTs use them all the time especially for patients with hip replacements that aren’t supposed to flex their hip past 90 degrees. They weren’t using it right which is why it didn’t work. You have to put the whole sock on it until the seam at the toe is pulled tight so when you put your foot in it, your toes are on the seam
4:26 My hairs already straight so no THANK YOU
I love y'all!
I dont think ive laughed so much on one of teens react episode. Please please please do more i was laughing my ass off
I’ve seen the egg sitter on inside edition

From where can I get that egg cushion
okay tv product 7:14 review
12:24 Legend say that egg gone
Emily is kinda boring
The sock thing is obviously gonna fail. Its only meant to be used with thin socks.
Same goes for the ear cleaner. Drill shape going into a cylinder means the tip wont actually touch anything.
Her face is so glossy wth

I dont think the brush will actually work on curly hair. Not unless you have something close to "straight" hair.
Troy looks smack like tfue .
I have a simply straight and I have curly hair...it don't do shittttttt😂
Can I try every single product that got shown on this episode
"There's even a remover for it? No, that's so extra."
me: Cool. Let's check back with her in 50 years. Then we'll see how extra it really is.
13:36 when the tip goes in by mistake
Le'Raun wave check
emily was boring for only trying one thing 🤷🏽‍♀️👀
I had that brush straightner and it sucked because it doesnt straighten perfectly and the hair dont stay straight for too long so I gave it away.
Emily looks so familiar I feel as though I’ve seen her on a Disney Channel show or something?
Troy looks like tfue

I'VE HAD ONE OF THOSE STRAIGHTENING BRUSHES THEY'RE REALLY GREAT
Why not try them, no punishment? 🤷🏻‍♂️
"I wouldn't buy it, but if someone else had it, I would use it." Me too sis.
I have the exact same simply straight but it works only on certain types of hair
"Girl, use a face mask." hahah
that moment when you realise that a guys waist is tinier then yours. Carson man how u do it?
I would try the hairbrush and the cushion 😂 and the dermasuction
I want to try all those things so bad
I love how the hairbrush worked for all the guys, but for the girls it did nothing lol
4:54 damn probably cuz her hair hasn’t been brushed in ages
BRO TROY HASNT BEEN IN AN EPISODE IN FOR EVER AS FAR AS IVE SEEN!!?? Oh and are they gonna have the same people who played the last of us 1 play two????

Did Becca change from a skirt to jeans mid video? Am I high?
That’s cool, BUT WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE WHITE SOCKS, WE NEED NERDY SOCKS!!
13:10 asmr🤤😂
the sock slider is more work then putting the sock on normaly all you do is put a sock on but sock slider is different you have to put the peace of plastic togeather then you have to put the hock and it streches your sock what if you hve small feet your socks wont fit anymore and you still have to put your shoes on

Disappointment💔
The waist stuff is so harmful. It could literally scwagqhduskle your organs.😂
I love jaxon 😂😂😂😂😂😂
they were twisting it the wrong way
Carson looked so feminine in the body wrap thing lol
this is random and has nothing to do with the topic of this video but carson would make such a good peter parker lmao
Don't put Q-tips in your ear. That just pushes wax further into your ear canal.
Really come on man I was eating
Blah blah blah am I a weirdo? Random person: yes you are a weirdo person I do not know
So is mikaela a teen a college kid or a adult 



Help I’m confused 🤷🏻‍♀️
Try not to look in a mirror!
Y’all gotta put the socks farther on the thing so ur whole foot gets in
This is how many people like FBE 
👇
A proper Corsett would be prettier and healthier.
. Becca uses Vaseline on her face?

. Thomas, the return of the nerd surfer

Carson, always the best!
9:01 He got his waist disturbingly small.
8:17 okay but he’s my favorite now

Please please don’t finish that sentence lol
1:12 wave check
7:09 He didn't even rotate it the right way
Their reactions when they saw the waist trainer knocked me out😂
That Egg Sitter.. Adler the Eagle is my boy
13:50 I'm like..... Becca.exe has stopped working shocked
But Billie eyelashes in a glass box like you did with poppy
The straightening hair brush would not work on anyone with actual kinky curly hair.... basically it's a hair straightener for already straight hair😂
Is Troy tfue?!?!
What is 'As seen on Tv'?.... is it like the Shopping Network?
That sock thing would work for pregnant women. If it was made better and actually thought out properly.
Try not to yawn plss
For the straightener brush one of the girls literally had straight hair so...
Is that Tfue?
They were using pretty long socks though
12:34 who else has seen the meme of this and thought it was the original HAHAHHAHA
When it comes to the sock one, you're doing more work trying to put the sock on that thing. It'd be so much easier just to put your damn foot in the sock LOL
Why does the superfarm sound like the Farm from Riverdale
For the sock slider, their socks were too long. They probably gave them long socks to ensure it would have a funny outcome and fail
My mom have almost all cosmetic products
"you still have to fit your shoe afterwards" lmao
When you sit on the egg and get up and its gone
I would've tried everything... i mean what do you get if you win?? a potato??
Why i don't interest to all products?
“I Can’t breath but that’s ok” me: “I’m dying”
Lol 😂 I’m surprised because about the  egg though
We have these!!!
Damnnnn Carson u got that thin waist tho😂😂 wish I had that...
Becca....

Jacob acts like a little kid
Is it just me or does Troy look like tfue 🤔
Lerauns eyes are soooo pretty
All the girls are already skinny with straight hair, trying products to get them skinny with straight hair... umm okay? 🤦🏼‍♂️😂
PLEASE REACT TO K-BANDS!! (like day6,  the rose N.flying etc)
The problem with the ear one is when you use it before you shower or cold, your ear wax hardens and isn't going to come out. It's why you need to clean your ears after a shower as the water and warmth softens your ear wax to allow it better access. 
For instance if you try and clean your ear just randomly on the couch, you might find nothing. But after a shower there is a bunch of wax.
The sock one is literally just for lazy people I mean look at how they looked it the fucking commercial, they was really struggling 😂💀 IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO PUT YOUR FUCKING SOCKS ON! 🤣
I like the girl name mikaela
haha i have the hair brush thingy
JAYKA IS SO PRETTY
10:26 you might have to bend to get the sock slider
wait i love thomas wtf.
just don't breath for the next few months, bend your rib cage permanently  and you yes you can get that hour glass shape you've always wanted
7:54 okay, if some of you can’t see, she’s wearing a shirt that isn’t tight enough for people to see her curves... in reality she is skinny enough to get some guys
Isn’t everything seen on tv now????
Bruh tray talks and looks like tfue 11:24

I have a DermaSuction
Why is everyone wearing the same socks lol 🤣
Dab on them haters
4:37 He is on teens react?! Oh how time flies..
Simply Straight doesnt even work I bought it and it never straighten my hair it made it puffy its horrible it only works on people who actually have thin, little hair and already have their hair a bit straight. I am naturally thin so I dont need anything like that I can eat anything I want .
Hold on, if the challenge is to try not to try, don't you have to try to try not to try, defeating the purpose of not trying....
I had a simply straight straightener and I tried it so did my whole family and it put all our hair straight
at 13:51 I thought I accidentally paused the video
6:40 most people twist it the wrong way
Troy looks like Tfue
ANY straightening brush is trash, imo. My grandma got me the OG InStyler back when i was a pricey 100$ too and it was a straight up waste of time and money. Want your curly (and I mean THICK CURLYYY hair. NOT wavy thin hair) hair basically blown out fluffy as HELL, sure, go for it.
In the thing you had to put in your ear you guys were doing it the wrong way.
4:00 that DO NOT WORK smfh. I have it😂that’s y u buy a regular damn straightener. (Only if u have straight/ lightly wavy hair it works) but for curls . Sis u will waste ur money 
Edit: 9:50 wow we r getting lazy af🤣
This has gotten out of hand.
i have literally been asking for this for a year buuuutt.....DO PEOPLE REACTING TO STRAY KIDS OMG PLEASE
This is not a roast but Troy looks like young Tfue
I wouldn’t be able to breath if I wore that waist thing.

I have that hot brush thing but i have 4c hair, it still works tho
My cousin got me a simply straight brush but my hair type is 3C and it didn't really work out.
The "eggsitter" reminds me of "purple" and their raw egg test. And both of them have the same type of design (honeycomb type) as well
Can't believe that they're all under 20's. 😂😂😂😂 Start eating some vegie kids
Is it just me or has Anna been a teen forever
Emily looks a lot like cierra Ramirez

7:13 HUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
these girls; Anna, Mikaela and Becca <3
i wonder how those eggs didn’t crack, what was the magic behind that thing? lol
this could’ve been a little better or funny if they all tried the products without really knowing how to use it or they probably just figure it out lol
socks yeah but what about shoes?
Becca is still cute AF but ... DAFUQ was up with them toenails?
I have the simply straight
These products have been around for years and way to many other people have made videos trying them for this to be interesting.
When the person cracked the egg for the seat thing their nail polish changed and the people who were at the mall sat on the egg sounded like actors lmao
Le’roun is so good looking😍
I thought this challenge was using the products without the instruction.
Boi you so tiny you wouldn't break the egg if you tried.
Okay but Emily fine fine 🥴🥴🥴
I'm just wondering how everybody had the exact same type of socks..?
Le'Raun's eyes cured my anxiety, im not joking.
Why do all of them have white striped socks?
You should do a video which makes them give dares to each other
What if they react to glo ups
You should do the same video but with that teeth whitening gel thing
hey Le'Raun im in love with you
Socks looked too long for it to work properly lel
At 4:28 had me died🤣
Wtf at 3:53 the girl sounded exactly like a woman who’s supposed to make commercials
Who thinks Troy looks like tfue
How do i join the superfam
Jaxon 💓💓💓
7:14 👏🏿👏🏿meme review
The egg went in her but
Emily is gonna get kicked out. (Least interesting person)
It surprised me when jaxon said Ass
Le'raun fine as heeeeeeeell
why does carson lowkey look like the perfect Heather's JD
Le'raun 🔥🔥🔥😍😍
The ear cleaner part was weird cuz half of them rotated it the wrong way LUL
Is it just me or does jaxton look like Five from TUA
my girl Becca rockin them triple D's at 17
If there's no punishment or reward I would try them all. You're only going to wonder what if otherwise.
So what is the point of not trying them? Bragging rights?
Mikaela just looks like a tragic mess most of the time 🙄🙄🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
12:48 mood
YEE-YEE-YEE-YEEEEET
Ok but why does Troy look like Keith from the try guys 😂
Funny that (when they were doing the twisty air clean thing) all the people who were twisting the wrong way (most of them) didn't see results
I have all of these products half of them my aunt has it

Why the fuck would you sit on an egg😂😂😂
“Doesn’t fry your hair my ass”
Becca has too much makeup on. She reminds me of that girl who turned into a doll, from the episode of " Are You Afraid of the Dark ?". #FACTS 📠
Ya I wish I could join the club but it’s not available in my country

I sat on an egg and I don’t know where it went??
My dad actually has something like the sock slider!!!  😂
The Simply straight works like 💩
Adults react to the Billboard Awards - 2019
THOMAS!! We missed him!
It’s new?
Ree
nice Becca is back
The brush doesn't really work on curly hair. It just makes it frizzy
I use the simply straight but it doesn't work
I had no idea this was new XD, great work on this video though!
Jaxon still had the waist strainer on him lol
I just clicked on this video
No idea it was new
Ear Wax is good for your ears though
This is the song that doesn’t end
Mostly all of theese were SCAMS😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂
Becca so cute man.
Le'Raun is super cute. His eyes tho 😍
14:27 brah it’s tfue
Where is flex tape?
Why would you want to sit on an egg anyway ?
Le'Raun is such a breath of fresh air. He's so sweet and polite and fun to see react. Emily on the other hand.. just reminds me of Ethan. I just hope this won't always be her way of reacting.
I have the smart swab
The brush
I have it
I laughed so hard when Jaxons sock was hanging off his foot and he just says "PERFECT"
Becca’s hair is relatable if you have naturally curly hair!!!
We Need Colby Brock AND Fam 5 here again
11:50 so truee LOL
11:54 MY GRANDMA HAS IT AND ITS SO COMFORTABLE
9:40 the man stills wear the miss belt i think he wants to be fit

Pewdiepie's next series : Product review
What the frick is As Seen On TV? Is it just TV commercials?
I have the simply straight and I love it! All I do is spray heat protectant before and bam 💥
What’s with the Red Cross on their faces  while trying a product? Seems pointless to me...
“Doesn’t fri your hair my ass” lmaoooooooo haha love jaxon
Bro jaxon is my favorite 😂😂😂
Great to see Tfue in FBE videos
What a victory Royale duude
i actually have the first one
Teens react to music (One Hit Wonders)
how is this harder than try not to eat challenge ?!
Y'all might think I'm weird, but Bobby pins! They get the ear wax out, and are harmless. My mom asked my Doctor it. And he okayed it. They actually make something to clean out your ears that actually kinda looks like a Bobby pin. But you could instead just get Bobby pins for a $1
She said " Its kinda half in but then " fuck this shit Im out "
I really thought the egg would break
Troy is tfues son
Becca is wearing so much makeup
My Mikaela 😍😍😍😉
I’ve had one of those straightening brushes for a long time and their really heavy but it works really well
7:26 I’m dead😂😂😂😂
You guys should do the smoothie challenge
Who else wants to leave because they all failed?
Jaxson... you’re dead to me
Cool
Thomas, Carson, Jackson and Le Raun, these boys are a feast to my eyes
13:51 anyone else think the video was buffering?
Have to teens react to aphmau
"Doesn't fry your hair my ass" i was dying laughing😂😂 4:28
I use the simply straight,its good for my hair
what are they getting x's for, i am confused
Mikayla said her hair is natural curly bish where
13:45 the way he sat down with the waist trainer still on 🤣😂
You guys can make a challenge of try to try the product
I mean I already wear girdles so..............

It wouldn’t be that much different I guess huh?
13:55 - 14:05 😂😂😂
Are those his real eyes? (Le’Raun)
The sock product would stretch your socks out really wide.
The thing is that... they all have gr8 bodies already XD
2:06 i agree 100% with him.
Le'Raun has pretty eyes
Hi
Is everyone getting this recomended now?
Hi
Hi?
I have dermasuction 


Yeeeeeaaaahhhhh
Lmao YouTube is drunk again
Why are all these comments so new
Anna is so cute 👀
Omg I remember Troy from masterchef.
“it did nothing...i’ll give it 5/10” lmfao
Posted 4 days ago, everyone sees it today
The dudes' reactions to the slimming belt XD
Jeez how long ago was this video posted. These comments were literally posted like 5 minutes ago.This is the earliest I’ve ever been to a video 😂
Becca needs to stop putting so much time and effort into her face with makeup and actually work on her toe nails. They are so yellow and weird looking. No offense just being honest
I'm just not ok with the fact that Thomas doesn't have an instagram
Troy Sounds Exactly Like Tfue
Why are all the comments so recent..? 😂 ಠ_ಠ
skinny queenz 
😭👸🏽
plot twist: the egg was hard-boiled.
Leraun tho 💞
They did not even pull the sock all the way and it’s so long
Who else thinks Carson looks like tome Holland
troy is tfues brother or something
maybe for stuff like this it isn’t necessary to make it a « try not to » challenge? i mean it would have been boring if none of them had tried the products so why not just make a « trying as seen on tv products » video?
That’s so fun, you should do more! But we don’t need the try not to, it will still be very interesting without a challenge
7:12 you were supposed to say meme review
Simply Straight is basically a hot comb without the stovetop fire, ear burns, and unholy amounts of flinching.
Jaxon literally twisted the ear thing the wrong way and said it didn’t work 🤦🏻‍♀️
Wave check
Wait if they are trying not to try then how can they try not to try if they cannot try
7:10 deep voice but next its way softer
carson is fittt 😂🥰
I was expecting the egg to break on someone
Thomas is my favorite 😍😳
That waist belt even hurts just watching it.
wait jaxon didn't take off the waist belt.... uh oh
Anyone notice when the person cracked the egg the hand changed
make more videos like this
“Woah insane, an egg... on my butt” 😂
They were spinning the ear thing the wrong way
14:05 I WISH I WAS THAT EGG
Carson looks like Peter Parker 😱
7:12 damn your voice got deep XD
woah insane! An Egg..On my butt!!😂😂😂😂
3:54 I have that and it Dosent straighten my curly hair good it just makes it frizzy but if you already have like slightly wavey or straight hair it would work better but that’s for me 😂
That egg thing...

...PURPLE!!!
All these people with straight hair using the brush going "Yeah it works!" Then the one legit curly haired girl was like "Nope"
Corsets actually help with back problems apparently
7:10 um he’s going the ring way for starters
7:09
>Spins it the wrong way
>"It did nothing"
"im an old 80 yr old dude breaking my back bc their shitty product doesnt work"
just USE PURPLE
10:53 White Air Force 1s smh clown of the day
4:30 ok but I have NEVER heard anyone curse on this show😂😂
Tfue really made an appearance
Becca’s makeup tho
Licensed Estheticians for the win! ❤
Ok  😐😮wow
someone get me Le’Raun’s social media
5:13 this chick really straightening her hair when it's already straight? Smh
As someone with naturally straight hair, when I wanna get curls, I get my hair in braids and put water to get it moist I DONT NEED NO CURLING IRON YEET
I like the egg sitter the most😂😂😂
These girls and guys are already skinny but ok 👌
I actually have the SmartSwab and it doesn’t work.
For the war thing most of them were turning it the wrong way
That thing would never work on my hair.....😅😅😅
The egg under the bowl is actually a picture and then they replace it with a real egg

One of the best episodes in a long time.
HOW IS CARSON SO DAMN SKINNY WTF
Omg🤦I looked at tomas's name an I thought it said Thanos 😂😂😂
Troy looks like tfue  lol 😂
I have the simply straight and it works really good
Please stop the "try not to" challenges... I would've much rather watched a Teens try challenge.. like without an explanation of what they are first or something. Try not to try is just not great. I don't want to watch people not trying things. I want to watch people trying them.
OMG I have the straight brush hair thing(simply straight) and it works so good
I hav simply straight
Wait a minute... with the egg sitter commercial you cAN SEE THE WOMANS NAILS CHANGE COLOR LMAOOO
Bruh their impressions of the egg sitter 🤣🤣
I think the sock side on thing needs to be tried again. I think you need to roll the sock all the way back to the front where the toes go and have the rest (like 95%) of the sock rolled onto the device to prevent your foot from not getting all the way in
"Doesn't fry your hair my ass."
I find Carson so attractive 🥰
You can see at 3:47 that the hair she has grabbed is already straight. LMAO
i ve had a crush on jaxon from since he started on react GODDAMMM
Does anyone else hate that becca
Jayka the type of chick you text then she screenshots it and puts in on her story
bruh jaxon was getting on my nerves fr when the dermasuction thing was on.

I wanna be on react channel so bad this is just so lit!

O the ear thing doesn’t work.
As they turn it the wrong way.....
9:08 I think she s squeezed dat belt too much ... just my impression
9:08 Well, it certainly amplifies for girls that are already well bestowed.. :p
Lol the guy had the waist thing for the rest of the vid 😂
Alot of these (the sock slider) is user error
5:49 Nobody is throwing anything anywhere Jaxon, that's not the right term here. C'mon, you're the right age for that word and everything!
it was at that moment that i realized that they might be sharing the same product over and over again...
2:22 Since she's smiling and all, I'm gonna assume that statement is ironic, but it's frightening how easily people are tricked into buying products with flimsy lies..
me: watches video
also me: sees Le'Raun's waves
hello, introducing me: how the fuc-
Aren't eggs meant to be sat on????
There are much better sock things out there, you can get them at Walmart.
We have. The ear wax one
I use the hair brush thing
7:14 He clapped twice could this mean something?
I would use the first one but nothing else
TOTALLY NOT SPONSERED
I don't know who this Le'Raun is.... BUT HIS EYES THOUGH
This is amazing
That Jaxon kid 😂😂😂
It's been a while thomas!
A content warning would have been nice for that first one 😂😉🤢🤮
I have the brush thingy and it doesn’t work 😂
The first one i wanna try because I got a blackhead problem... great video by the way
I would totally lose this, like i would do the brush thing - and my hair is like le'raun's.

I have the waist trainer, but I use it kinda like a back brace for back pain and stomach cramps. I don’t put it as tight though lol
Please someone tell me if a dentist injection hurts

I was dying from laughter with the waist piece
That sock thing is just too funny 😂
Alright we all know now Troy is not true but it’s his long loss brother...
Dear sock slider: shoes.  Edit: when you like your own comment on accident.  0-0
well u cant breath cuz your wearing it on a shirt
You should never stick anything in your ears or clean them out...
Yo wtf i lowkey got the same chair
Le'Raun has so beautiful eyes
I would lose😭
My mam has that hair straightener brush
7:17 (miss belt) that looks like a cartoon character in real life it looks horrible
7:14 actually a 9 year old army
Isn’t it bad for your skin to manually extract sebum from your pores using pure strips and extractors like that?
I have the brush that “straightens” your hair and it doesn’t work
I have the heated hair brush bc I have curly hair and it works 😂
Le'Raun cute no hype
Try not to try’?

7:18  *meme review*
Hey! Just wanted to bring awareness to the fact that a lot of these items made are actually for people with disabilities but if they market them that way no one will buy them, so they make insane commercials so others buy them too and they can continue to be in business and provide for those who actually need the items (like the sock thing)
I see jayka, i clicked.
Can you do a celebrity try not to sing. Challenge or dance to there song.Or the teens have to have a kid and a grandparent to take care of
Hiiiiiiiiii🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️🖐️

"You wanna try it"

"Haha....no"

Jaxon: twirls the ear cleaner the wrong direction
Jaxon: It does nothing!

Hi I love the videos cool
1.15 omg his eyes 😚
5:32 "but doctor visits can be expensive", can't relate as someone living in a country with free health care
Okay but Jayka and Becca are my new crushes
WHY IS EVERYONE JUST NOW COMMENTING??
next time : 
try not to try flextape
So nobody gonna talk about how bad Jayka is? 😍
The company that made sock slider just acted like a sock-aid doesn't exist. WHICH ACTUALLY WORKS
the simply straight actually works! just saying, my mom has a brush just like it and it works amazingly so!
8:36 “I can’t breath but like it’s fine” lmao
React to Ateez PLEASE
6:59 that's what she said
After like the first or second product im pretty sure everyone forgot about the challenge
Carson is a skinny legend with that waist trainer
Im jiggling rn
🤗.
like if jayka is fine
LOLLL My mom bought that egg sitter cushion a while back. I didn't know it was an as seen on tv product. My brother is currently using it on his desk chair.
Hahaha when none of them cared about trying to win the challenge at all! They didn't even seemed to have second thoughts trying out the products! I love it!
React to Adam Sandler's Chris farley song
Most of this video is the reason why I've stopped buying As Seen On TV stuff. I mean, look at the Fushigi Ball. They make it look so magical like it actually floats. I buy it, try it out, and break it the month after.
noone used that socks thingy correctly. you're supposed to wrap the sock all the way down on that thing so that your toes go to end of the sock from the beginning
So I help flatten my friends hair sometimes and we use her simply straight. It works really well to be honest. You just have to use it right.
Christ, becca is stacked
Le Raun is so endearing! I hope he's in more videos
Btw Troy kinda reminds me of Tfue
I’ve had the hairbrush straightener and I just want to say, with my hair, it doesn’t work. Well I mean, it works, but it’ll be frizzy asf🤷🏼‍♀️
4:30 doesn’t fry my hair my a$$
Sadly everyone does not clean their ears 😪 I have seen people took ear buds out of their ears with ear goooo like u wanna hear this song? 🤢 nah yo I'm good
On the brush I have one it’s light pink and I used it today
If i dont see flex tape in this video imma go nuts
I love Jaxon 😍. Oof, that was weird
at 3:34 you don't need a hair dryer
Try not to try 
But if they're trying not to try... aren't they already trying? 🤔 🙄
So where does the egg go🤭
Please do this to elders react 💙
Jaxon is the best 🙌🏻
i think that the ear thing didnt work for some of them cause they spin it the wrong way
12:44 i love how he’s sitting with the corset thingy on
Carson looks like Tom Holland
Jayka is so beautiful !!💓
lmao le’raun
woah
Buut...if they try not to try..aren't they trying?
It woulda been funny if the egg cracked when Jayka sat on it 😭😭😂😂😂
Has Mikaela even graduated yet because she's 19 and shouldn't be in already in college kids react? WTF
Nice to see Tfue joined you guys for the video today
Jaxon made me laugh alot
Dam I was eating when I saw the first product....
on the egg sitter, before the person cracks the egg the nail color changes. 12:11
12:44 wOaH aN eGg On My BuTt
Do a try not to say wow
YO MIKAELA IS A LICENSED AESTHETICIAN??? That’s cool
Yep I’ve checked and nobody is gonna talk abt Le’rauns eyes bro 😂😭🤦🏽‍♀️
4:30 😂😂omg this cracked me up way more than it should’ve
That sock slider is actually pretty useful..
9:13 ily for that jaxon 😂
You know the item that helped you
Put on your sock how did they put there sock on the holder if they cant bend over?
Can we all agree that Carson is beautiful
Troy looks like tj from Andy Mack!!!
1:06 I don't have the money, guess I'm not special after all
Am I the only one that is bothered by how with the egg seat that’s women lightly taped the bowl with an egg and it broke perfectly in 2
4:30 Jackson "doesn't fry your hair my ass" *I died 🤣
I have the hair brush straightener and I’m literally using it rn
My mom has the first one it hurts so bad it takes a while
Is this dude “TFUE” FBE edition?
I have the hair brush straightener and it works so well!
EAR THERMOMETERS I CANT
How you get tfue to come?
They bleeped out everything except the gd word. smh
The swab one isn’t “healthy for your ears” and you also shouldn’t take out all the ear wax since the wax keeps bacteria from entering that area
I’m always thinking that troy looks like tfue
You still have to put your shoes on. OMW I dieeeeeed.
i actually have a hair straightening brush and it works SOOO well! i’ve had it for a year or so and it works really well every time i use it. if you have thicker hair, you do have to straighten pieces of hair a couple times but all in all, it really only takes like 5-10 minutes to finish. totally recommended :)
hi! May I please get a shoutout?💜 have a great day FBE!😊
9:50 you probaly are gonna keep this on the ground your going to need to bend over to put the sock on the cradle.
"You can sit on an egg without breaking it"
Hands with white nails grab the egg to crack open yet hand with red nails cracks it open
heyyyyu
Aaaaaaaaaaaa
Jaxon really likes this waist trainer guys😭😭😂
What the f*** just happened to her waist 7:26
Mikaela has been a teen for the last 21 years
"An egg on my Butt" lol
They were twisting it the wrong way
Omg do they really think 3:42 is new??? This is basically an electric hot comb. These things have been around for YEARS. I use one ever time I’m in a rush on wash day to blow dry my hair.
what is up with mikaelas eyes?
people that have trypophobia

*have left the chat
Yeet yeet yeet YEET.
His eyes😍😍😍
7:15 wrong way brother
Mikaela is a licensed esthetician... did anyone else not know that?? No wonder her skin, hair, nails, etc always looks so good
Such a eggciting and eggstreme episode.
Jason's waste on hope of the egg sitting down
4:05 I have one of those! It’s not specifically that kind but it does work!
I was so disappointed when there was no prize and so punishment
7:09 ''i got nothing''


ofc u got nothing, u are turning it the wrong way
Le’raun is my favorite, keep him pleaaaase
do not eat ice cream while watching the first commercial. i repeat do NOT
Hiiiii like if u like FBE
That's the worst brush I got it and it didn't work at all
Alternate Universe: No one used anything and the video just ended..
yeet...yeet......yeet......YEET!
Becca is nice lol
11:30 😂😂😂😂
Keep Le'Raun and Emily
Le’Raun is...... just wow
Where’s slap chop
I have the flat iron brush :D
wait a minute
I wish  y'all made this last year before I wasted my money on that sock POS.. js lol
Troy went from master chef junior to this
if they cant bend over how do they put their shoes on 🤔
Le raun has clean waves
Wasn’t the egg hard boiled? I saw like a brown circle at one end
That sock thing would probably work best with ankle socks

At 13:51 like if you felt the video paused automatically.
DermaSuction gave me a straight up hickie on my face. Do not recommend.
Maybe you guys could have a punishment product they had to use if they lost, like the miss belt.
First of all who wants to sit on an egg?
Part 2
7:10 Spins it the wrong way.
"It did nothing."
We have a simply straight and now i want to try it
Jaxon has grown so much wow. Crazy how fast time flies
carson and troy are so handsome i can't 😫
Umm eggs wont break if you sit on them or try to crush them. They are structurally designed to not break by crushing. Seriously try to squeeze one. It won’t break
jaxon still is wearing the waist trainer😂
Lmao face masks don’t do anything
Hi
Hi
I like Jaxon 😂😂
2 ppl here look like ppl from victorius
Try not to not try a try not to challenge

Me: enjoying a burrito (wHiTh GuAcAmOlE iN iT)
React: shows me 2:05
Me:🌯➡️🗑
I use the simply straight all the time because I have really thick hair and a regular straightener takes hours so it’s such a time saver for me :)
Y do you wanna sit on a egg?!
Notice all the miss waist ladies were wearing loose shirts then they put on the product... and it was only slim women in videos not just photos...
Okay but the chocolate guy and his eyezz💔
I had the simpley straight for a present and it's not even good it makes my hair go frizzy 😂😂😂

Emily if you're not a gamer this is the wrong gig for you
2:47 THE WAY HE SAID YUCK
Why does troy looks like tfue?
Who else noticed that Jaxon wore that waist adjuster thing the whole time after he tried it?
My Gramma has that sock thing
I love that straightening brush! It's a life saver!
Damn they just wasted some money
Why does becca always look so oily? It disturbs me sorry 😞
I saw this while eating i
I probably would've lost this challenge simply because I would've tried them all to make sure people are getting their money's worth. Tbh.
I love that girl’s jeans
The fact that jaxon was still wearing the waist trainer as he sat on the egg makes me laugh so hard
9:01
im jealous bcos of his tiny waist
Are they trying to try not to do everything in the world?
damn that girl wearing green is cute af and lowkey funny idk why

why would people put an egg on a chair and don't put it in the fridge like other people do like what is wrong with people.?
I guess the girl with oily face must have some powder on
7:14 My boy Jaxon with Product Review 👏👏
3:52 my mother has actually bought that one. We use it to make our hair just a bit straighter tough.
I’m impressed by Jaxon wearing that waist trainer for that long
12:49 they werent hired come on your getting on my nerves
9:08 If god exists, he was really generous to this young woman. :D
They missed perfect opportunity to make a Mariah Carey joke
The brush was the best
@4:31 she really had the nerve to ask him if that was something he wanted to try 😂 like come on now
7:11 spins it the wrong way and says it didn't work. Okay
5:58 it literally said on the back of the box dont insert into your ear so i dont know where you got that from
12:30 wait that wasn't supposed to work
No prize for the winner??
I love the straightening brush
That waist trainer scares me so much and I'm going to cry
I always wondered where my mom bought the simplify straight
I have the Simplify Straight
Curly girl here is freakin out because these girls with perfectly straight hair feel the urge to buy this brush like why?!
7:13 pewdiepiw Reference
Don't wear that corsett thing, especially if you're a female it will damage your womb and make you infertile
My like is for Jason doing product review and clap clap 7:13 9 y/o army ❤️

holy fk Le’Raun’s eyes are damn gorgeous
Should try it challenge!! If else you don't try you lose😂
The people trying the eggsitter, why would they want to try it? If it didn't work they would have egg on their butt for the rest of the day
How could no one realise that they used the sock machine the wrong way. Me an intellectual saw that they didn't put the sock all the way on. Therefore only half of the sock were on there foot. Disappointment
Okay!!! This was a great episode!!!
1:01 looks like Tom Holland
Man this was one of the intersting videos i’ve watched on react or FBE
Jayka is soooooooo Beautiful
Jaxon:I give it a 5/10 *claps next product
9yr old army:hmmmmm he’s not 9 but he can do some stuff for the army write his name down in the maby
We finally found Barbie’s secret.
Jayka is so gorgeous
14:33 he didn’t even lose
love how i already knew all of these
Why are all the comments coming now😂
I love how that seat cushion was made for back pain but people were obsessed with the fact that you could sit on an egg and it wouldn't break lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who uses pore strips? Those are horrible for your skin.
"You'll still have to put your shoes afterwards" 😂good point.
7:10 look at the arrow
Huh... somehow Jaxon looks like he could have been 15yrs old highschool spiderman...
Why do they all have white socks?
Ayyy I actually own an egg sitter, it's pretty sick.
DAmn all these people wearing long ass socks
0:25 looks like a younger Willne🤣
Carson's waist looks so tiny oh my gosh

Wtf i want to see them use it not challenge them not to use it tf
If try not to try then you can’t try not to tro beacause if you try not to try then you are trying not to try





Hope you understand what that meant
5:35 Be honest how many times have you replayed that?
BTW Anna is pretty cute.
Cool that it doesnt break the egg but in all seriousness what benefit is that to your backside? Unless you plan on nesting all day
Wtf is tfue doing here ?

Thomas struggling "beauty... Will be mine!"
Does anybody here sock-shoe-sock-shoe rather than sock-sock-shoe-shoe?
How are you gonna put on and tie your shoes after ,your that lazy🙈
who else was waiting for and just wanted Thomas to use the hair straightener brush. It would have been so satisfying hahah
They all tried it with long socks 🤦‍♂️
“It did nothing, I’ll give it a 5/10”😂😂
My boi Jaxon said NEXT👏 PRODUCT👏 he’s a true gamer
Who that new cute Chocolate dude???
This was on my recommend I just watch whatever YouTube recommends me
Damn it Jayka is just so damn adorable  man. 
And I agree with everyone else don’t bring Emily back. She was boring and didn’t try anything. At the end of the day you didn’t win anything chick. Everyone else won by having fun
Troy looks like tfue
Get adults or teens to react to shark tank products that would be cool
People with already straight hair trying the hair straightener? confused
this interesting
Doesn't fry my hair my ass
Anna is so cutee❤
Jaxon looks like a baby in teens react 😂
Try not to not try???
They all spun the ear cleaner backwards except for one. No wonder why it didn’t work 😂
Suddenly got a craving to sit on an egg
Jaxon is such a nine year old 😂
When you are kinda early but don't know what to comment . . .
"But once this product is introduced, you're in color!"
what is this, Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz?!
Huh
Is it just me or does tray look a bit like tfue
Hi am I early?!

I'm here!!!!!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Anna has the narrowest eyes I have ever seen in my life.
dont bring Emily back. she only wants to win 😂😂😂
Le’rauns eyes are so pretty 😍
1st product don’t we have ointments or whatever for the yucks plus who cares nobody unless your a rich kid then this is for you  

2nd product they just mix 3 products together and just release as a new product I’m better off getting a hair cut by a barber who can set my hair on fire 

3rd product everyone cleans their ears with the q-tips who’s going to use this no one I rather learn sign language btw Switch at birth

4th product wow thank you thank you so much now we can look like the queen from that live action Snow White movie in 2012 Mirror Mirror I’m not joking they really did made that movie

5th product like the AVGN once said in the NES accessories “it’s a piece of f**ing plastic” Nintendo labo VR bird game or whatever it’s called is better than this if you don’t know what I’m  talking about look it up

6th product the egg sitter what? it’s just a cushion you see in kindergarten also here’s the question everyone is concern why would you sit on an egg seriously why do we look like chickens not even chickens would like this
why you penalizing people for providing first person consumer information?
I was having a bad time and seeing this almost instantly made me feel better. Just some nice, light-hearted content.
Oh my! What a cushion!
I was literally eating ice cream when the first video started. Not eating that now.

"I can't breath but its fine" LMAOO
I literally wanted to try everything
“yeet, yeet, yeet...YEET”
7:11 
Jaxon : it did nothing
ME : boi, you turn it wrong way
Ok but I feel like they used the sock product wrong? The problem always seemed to be that they couldn't get their foot in deep enough and I feel like rolling the sock up more, so there is less distance for your foot would help a lot with that.
I actually have that brush hair straightener and it works very well.
Jaxon is my favorite 😂😂😂
Emily needs to live a little. Good on her for winning though.

You shouldn't put anything in your ear ask any otolarynologist, even qtips are likely to do more harm than good.  Just wash your ears in the shower and maybe once or twice a month use a 50/50 mix of water and hydrogen peroxide to clean them out.

Can you please react to tabbes if you haveint well thats all by by🙋
Any information about THOMAS omg
I have that "smart swab" thing and it actually works really well... they werent getting anything because they were rotating it backwards... so technically they were just pushing the wax in.
13:43 jaxon looks so funny omg
Hi😃
DOES THIS THING REALLY WORK??
B but the punishment there has to be a punishment
@7:12 pewds would be proud
Just watching the miss belt made it hard for me to breath
Why would Jayka even need that waist strap thingy, she already has a tiny waist, right?
Do teens react/eat mochi!
Jaxon is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yay Thomas is back
that was amazing. great content👌👌👌

I wonder if that cushion is actually confortable. It certainly looks like it is.
Please do teens react to starkid
I like that people were trying tv products and reacting to the commercials
But I just wish instead they all had to try it and give REAL OPINIONS on the products
There will be a lot of creepy foot fetishists around here  xD
Mikaela has been 19 for the last 3 years 😂
What is Le'Raun's shirt from? It seems to say「悪名高いで」... is that from some anime or something?
You still have to bend down to set the sock thingy on the floor tho
I wonder if they'll eat the eggs now lol
rakes through hair aggressively "it didn't work!"
They spun the swab the wrong way lol
This is a great new idea!
It would be awesome if you react to Marina
Why do you have to make a try not to challenge from everything? It was more fun when they had to try it. (You know REACT to it and all). And they tried it anyway so we can say this was a fast failure and less entertaining...
WAIT CARSON GOT HIS BRACES OFF EDFRTGHJHTR
O o f
Le'raun is just handsome !! His eyessss
I have a feeling that sockslider would work if they gave shorter socks
i've missed carson ILOVE HIM SM
Jaxon- it did nothing
turns it the wrong way
My dog died. Like of you agree👍
6:30 booger picker lol
I was eating while watching this vid...ew those gross commercials
Can't wait to be 18 to have money and to join the channel😭
Seriously, all those people with little or straight hair just HAD to try the hair-straightener brush thing?
Slim belt is ok until u have take it off 2 wear a bikini
This was a great idea! I hope you’ll do another one
Jaxon is best Reactor. A fine representative of the 9 year old army.
I hope you guys cleaned those things well before the next Reactor used them.

You could have had some real fun and making a cracking noise when they sat on the egg.
As someone with a disability that requires me to use a device to put on my socks, I can fully agree that the sock slider does not work and putting on shoes is still an issue 😂
Jaxon spins smart swab the wrong way "It did nothing" silly goose xD
"like sis wasn't even tryin'" frickin love Becca
You don’t need egg sitter, if you sit on egg on top of any soft fabric it doesn’t break
7:14 Here we have a man of true dignity and class.
Deems suction actually works for dead skin and zits
struggling "Beauty... will be mine" 😂😂
I might buy that egg chair, that looks cosy as f***,  and I have a bad back.
Where 👏 is 👏 the 👏 flex 👏 tape
Jaxon really worn it throughout
I use that brush on my 4c hair, it's pretty good
Good Video
Jaxon is such a crush
Jayka is honestly so beautiful
I have the straightener for my curly hair and it works. I'd like the egg sitter for my own spine. The sock thing doesn't like it would work for me but to put on my socks, I just lift my leg over my lap lol, no bending down required.
Mikaela is sooo pretty😍
My sister broke my ear drum with a Cotten swab so yea
Fellow foot fetishers, LIKE THIS COMMENT :D
Troy is the next tfue
REACT TO TWICE FANCY!
REACT TO DAY6
Carson looked SNATCHED in that waist trainer hahahahah
Thomas is back 😻
how are the people with straight ass hair gonna day that the hair brush straighter works LMAOOO BYE
2:06 true
Those sock helpers take a while to get used to but my mam, ho vroke her back a few years ago, swears by it
I try it really do leave my hair really straight I love it
bro jayka is so pretty
React to STRAY KIDS
That was fun one :)
I have such a crush on Thomas!! 🤷🏻‍♂️
a Try TO Try challenge whould be great
React to grime teens
carson is so cute omg omggg
Well I would have tried all of them 😂
Jaxon: AN EGG, on my butt!
Me:*Dies of laughter*
An egg, on my butt!
"Try not to try" say that slowly until you get it and so they should have won.
Carson is such a cutie !
ok but can we talk about how fine Le'Raun is
I love Thomas
"Simply straight" can it turn me straight? 😂
Of course the egg didn’t break. Mikaela’s ass is softer than that jelly cushion. #thethingsiwouldearoutofherass
I read Thomas as Thanos
lmao why is there no punishments
Why is the comment section for those videos always so weird?
They spinned the ear one the wrong way
Jesus Becca. Or should I say beCCa.
8:17 we were routing for you! We were all routing for you!!!
Did you make them share the same sock?
Am i the only one who noticed the girl's nails changing at 12:08???😂😂
Why are everybody just commenting seconds ago?!?!?!
Troy reminds me of Tfue 😂😂
*Try Guys left the chat*
I don't mean this to be rude, just a slight constructive critsim comment. I think this video would have been better if it wasn't a challenge. It just took the fun out of it to me. Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching them trying all these products! And I would love to see another episode.
9:09 ITS SO BIG!
i have that brush lmao mines rubbish
This episode actually turns out fun! Great fbe
Carson kinda looks like Alex turner
I couldn’t stop thinking of the video where someone breaks the egg haha
They didn't use the Sock thing right 😒
7:12 thats my boi over there 👏👏
Trust me on this, pay the extra for The Purple cushion. That egg sitter started to breakdown after 4 months over the summer and gives off a funky odor. Granted, The Purple costs $70 but when your in a truck for 8-12 hrs/day, it's damn worth it.
They’re wearing the same socks wtf😂😂😂
6:17 you actually shouldnt do it to much because earwax is there to protect your ear
I used to use the simply straight brush thing but it took longer than normal straighteners do (in my opinion) so gave it away
12:45 😂😂😂
I have that hair straightener
How do I get on this show/chanel
I have the simply straight hair straightener and it doesn’t work well.
Who else realised that the hair comb thingy was used on the wrong side?😂 Around 3:55
No one wears socks like that FBE
I like how none of them passed
6:56 “it feels ineffective” 😂😂😂😂😂
7:24 any woman who considers this as an option to be thin needs major therapy.
That waist trainer looks crazy...
You guys are all thinkin` it so i`m gonna say it; Jayka will be a total babe two years from now.
MORE THOMAS
If they are doing the TRY not to try challenge then aren’t they already trying? Does that make sense
Le'Raun looks way older than 16!!
7:10 bro the arrow literally says turn the other way
Is it just me or do amercians have reeeaaally long socks o_o
Why are they all bout human body? If any of y'all had a vacoon with ability to sort out all The things on The floor, I would buy it

Wtf look 7:56
Why does Troy almost look like and sound like TFue at like 18 but with brown hair 😂😂
Mikaela hi babe❤️❤️❤️
Jayka in 2yrs is going to look like a whole snack.
If I use that dermasuction thing on my face, I'll make lots of money by extracting hundreds of gallons of oil!
Let them react to "if i can't have you " by Shawn Mendes 🔥👋
My favorite part! 73:00:00
That brush straightener does not work as smoothly on curly hair like that commercial makes it look😂 also it will burnt your scalp
I have it
That damn brush straightener burned my hair and neck
I have the brush (not the same brand) and I LOVE IT
You done it the wrong way
yeet, yeet, yeet, YEET

“It don’t fry ur hair my ass” 😭
Le'Raun look so cool 👌🔥🔥
jaxon is soo cute
Carson cracks me up every time
Omfg that girl named becca just tried the makeup gun
I have the simply straight. It kinda works
Love this!!
Haha I would loose
6:44 like she it diheheheheehn't do anhhhything
I love the cast
Anyone else knew none of those projects would even work? That egg sitter was a surprise though...
Oh my God I remember when Jayka was on Kids react!!! She's so grown up now, wtf?!?! o.o
Welcome back Thomas! Been so long since he had an episode on FBE.
Mikaela looks extra gorgeous in this episode
only i can say:
xD
you're actually not supposed to clean your ears with anything. the ears are self cleaning.
hi person looking in the comments
OK thats clearly not good for your body @ corset thing !!
i hate jaxon
Y have I never seen le’raun before
Wait....jayka is here in the philippines right?
I made the mistake to eat while watching this
9:07  Carson's dummy thicc but also a skinny legend
8:24 "beauty shall be mine " 😂😂
I like how they all said the swab was ineffective but almost everyone turned it the wrong direction
Troy literally looks like Tfue
So in the first product, do they each get one, or use the same one? I’d skip that one unless I’m the only one who’s used it
I can’t use the Smart swab because I don’t have a ear drum
THE BRUSH DOESNT WORK ON MY HAIR GUYS 🙄🙄🙄
React to Alan walker

so .. as i thought .. i still have a crush on carson
3:29 What if a bald guy was in this challenge?
I actually have the simply hair one and mine is better and prettier just sayin I am not showing off I hate those people who so that
Looks like everyone forgot this was a challenge but I like this. Do another one but maybe leave the challenge part out.
thomas look so 90's LOL
would like to express that I'm in lov with troy
Product Review
Who else was waiting for a penalty?
So where are you guys from?
Mikaela looks like Teresita Ssen Marquez, Reina Hispano Americana 2018 from PH
The egg thing really isn't that impressive. It takes massive amounts of force to crush an egg when applying equal pressure to all sides. On a rubbery cushion like that, it would be almost impossible to crush the egg, not because the cushion's good, but because the shell is just really sturdy.
Jaxon looks like Parker in Liv and Maddie
The egg did not brake because eggs have a realy high durability when the presure is spread evenly
And not because of the Pillow
12:59  Emily is soo adorable here broo
you tryna tell me no one has ever tried putting their socks on by crossing each leg over their lap and doing it that way
God I wish I was that egg
“Doesn’t fry your hair my ass” 😂
Carson look likes Tom Holland which is SpiderMan in Avengers Endgame and Infinity War
The only 2 I would've tried was the last 2 XD
react to mac demarco!!!!!!
For the egg sitter , Ik they were actors but who tf would volunteer to sit on a egg
They were turning that ear wax thing the wrong way. If you look at the handle it has arrows in the direction you twist it and they turned it in the opposite direction
Jaxon sitting on the egg cushion wearing the waist trainer😂🤙
3:46 we need that guy to straighten his whole head
i have that ceramic straightening brush lol
This was such a funny episode to watch
I've never wanted so hard to be an egg.
thomas loterally look like liam hemsworth wtf is goin on
do a react to kacey musgraves
Sticking to pore strips? Do you know how bad those are? sksksk
Half the people were not turning that Q-tip thing the right way lol maybe, just maybe that’s why it didn’t work?
11:08 & 13:52 why''d she change her outfit lol?
This products are dumb... But video was good tough jaja
Wavy hair isn’t curly hair 





Just saying
They were twisting the ear cleaner the wrong way that’s why it didn’t work
if its a try not to try then would all of them be losing cuz theyre trying not to try?
I wanted someone to prove that the egg they used is an egg that can crack and isn’t a hard boiled egg
There should be a react to duck song because it's been 10 years
I need that cushion in my life
6:14 No you shouldn't clean your ear there's wax in it for a reason
The fact that jaxon jept the trainer on is a mood.
11:11  am I the only one who’s just looking at her toe nails
Technically they all lost because they were trying not to try
I have the miss belt and it is really uncomfortable 😭
Le'Raun is so gorgeous 😍🔥

Teens react to Troom Troom!!!
For the next episode can they react to Shawn Mendes “If I cant have you”
You know that Thomas guy reminds me of this kid in this episode of Sam and cat called the “texting competition” or something
La’Raun 💕🥵
You have to take the socks off again later, so unless they have an invention for “after” putting it on as well, what’s the point to buy it for a grandparent lol. Plus arnt we weakening our muscles by  not practicing bending and such. That ones def not worth it in my opinion. Love the reactions ♥️♥️♥️
I think the ear wax one didn’t work for the people who turned it the wrong way.. it has an arrow on it for a reason
Carson Lowkey reminds me of Peter Parker lol
yeah the Miss Belt isn't recommended by doctors and is a health risk to your body and your own safety, this is one product that shouldn't be shown in this video. So thanks FBE for showing a product that is a health risk to everyone
6:43 becca.exe has stopped working
Why does Thomas look like a guy that was on FBE like 4 years ago
i learned so many new things about mikaela today
Tbh,my faves were the ones who actually did try the products
Thomas was so enthusiastic about the sock one then he just seemed so disappointed when it only went on half way 😂
at 12:48 that kid  jaxon still had on the miss belt on 💀💀
The people who said the ear thing didn't work turned it the wrong way in there ears

Teens react to what is school for
Did Becca change from a skirt to jeans or am I losing my mind? lol
My dad actually bought the sockslider cuz he was too lazy to put his socks on by himself. And it looks to me that the teens wear socks that are too long for it to work right lol And why would ANYONE want to sit on an egg??? They all sat so gingerly on the egg. Someone should have like jumped on it or something to truly test it out lol
when jaxon sat on the egg with the waistrainer on, i lost it💀

How do you know who won the challenge if by the time 1 guy finishes his part other guys have to do the same thing? Everybody stays in the studio or something or you call them later to film the winning scene or you film a winning scene with everybody?
Hey can I please have a shoutout
11:11 I did not just see those crusty toenails 😂
Jaxon spun the ear thing the opposite way from everyone else 🤦‍♂️
But if you try not to try, you are trying not to try which means you`re trying and have failed the challenge
7:30 this ain't a waist trainer it's a back brace I got sCoLiOsIs
I have the hair brush straightner and they were using it wrong that's why it didnt really work. You can't brush through it quickly like you would normally brushing your hair, you have to go through your hair slowly as if you were using a flat iron 😊
Hey can you guys please tell Thomas how cute and fucking good looking he is? thank you
It actually really works believe me
My mom has the first one
The brush straightener does not work that well. But I do also have the smart swab which works great

The sock slider didn’t work because you have to put the sock around it more so it doesn’t slip off.

10:44 onwards... why are they using their right hand to brace it while putting their left foot through? For shoe horns, you have to use your left hand to hold on to the shoe horn if you're inserting your left foot, and your right hand for your right foot. Otherwise the insertion angle doesn't fit well - you'll struggle more.

9:15 looking good Jaxon😂😂😂😂
Becca is really pretty and cute 😊
Idk... I think this would be better if you just had them try out the products instead of making it a challenge. Because of course we want to see them try them out. Just seems pointless to make it a challenge where they can choose not to. The viewers don’t want to watch people not try something. And it’s not like we’re suspenseful when waiting to see if they’re gonna win or lose, like we are in the other “Try not to” videos. Just some constructive criticism for ya lol

I'm reminded of the product that cracks an egg for you because apparently people can't do it without getting egg shells in the pan. I believe that has happened to me like 3 times in my 30 some years of cooking eggs.

i love jayka omg
She's FLAWLESS
13:11 when she gives a lap dance for the first time.
i am actually sitting on the egg sitter watching this video.
Ok, so Becca trying out the sock thing was a fail. Didn’t she say beforehand like “what about the shoes afterwards”? While smartass Jaxon only found out after trying out the sock thing.

Oh well, Jayka made up for it by trying out the seat cushion for us. (And a lot more 😁)
I guess not many ppl know that it's actually very difficult to squash an egg
Reminds me of 
Kian and Jc: We Review Stuff So You Don't Have To Lol
i think most of them were twisting the ear thingy in the wrong direction?
I think Jayka needs new jeans. Maybe y'all should start a GoFundMe for her.

Please  react to the whole album of Map of the Soul: Persona that just came out, it's a BOP!

Why would you make this a try not to try challenge that makes it counter intuitive

Okay, but like... eggs have a surprising amount of structural integrity... so I'm not sure how much is due to the cushion's abilities.

So you're just straight up advertizing terrible products now?
Am I the only one that thinks Troy looks like Tfue
Already been a huge fan of Becca for a long time, because she has great taste and knows her stuff. So I always love when she pops up in React videos. But here... Daaaaaaamn, Becca. Wow.
WOW.

This is some Dragon Ball Z shit, where Goku drops all his weighted training gear, and suddenly it becomes apparent that they've been limiting his actual powers, and hiding his true power level.

We all know Becca is brilliant, classy, and cute, but she's hiding the fact that she's also a bombshell.
Jayka is like Ashley Del Mundo
I wanna try the spot sucker lol
Simply straight ?why does everything gotta be straight?
Plz do anouther teens try not to get scared challenge plz

The egg test is a gimick. an egg can endure any circular pressure the cusion does'nt matter. An egg only breacks when pressure hits one point hard and fast, shattering it. (Sorry if I sound snobby lol)

This video is a waste. Why watching people not doing things ? You give objects to people, we want to see them using these objects and ... REACT to them ! It's so easy to not doing things that the video has no interest. For information I misread the thumnail and thought they did try TV products.
Jaxon is my boy my fave reacted
🔥🔥🔥 Please Elders react to Billie Eilish - bury a friend  😲😲😲
I feel like the Sock-Slider would work best with ankle socks
on another note, some of these are great tools for the elderly (mostly talking about the jelly cushion that relieves pressure points--if that is true) but the sock grabber thing is actually used in occupational therapy for patients with hip fractures (it's called a reacher but it probably works way better than whatever the heck was in the video)
also that corset looks like a badddd idea from a nursing viewpoint...it looks like one of those body casts that could compress the mesenteric artery and cut off circulation to your intestines...nausea, vomiting, no bowel sounds...bad idea.

I think Thomas is the type of guy, when a friend dares him to go do something crazy, he would probably do it

Is this really what YouTube has come to, it's kinda sad.
Pls pls pls react to LadBaby and/or YUNGBLUD
I think we've officially jumped the shark... a channel that literally makes videos about reacting to things is now challenging its cast to see a thing and do absolutely nothing. Why not just "Teens React to As Seen on TV Products?" Why was that not good enough? Not everything has to be a stupid challenge video.
I am so glad you upload so much new content. I subscribe to all FBE channels, and I have watched everything I can lol

Maybe, just maybe, you should use Boomers from somewhere other than California. Pretty sure you would be getting much different answers from the rest of the country.
Madison is right
They keep saying its dying on its own but dont realize that they been doing it. We are also killing taking responsibilty for ourselves.
6:55 198,000$ in 1960 is roughly equal to 1,725,000$ in 2019. Let that sink in for a moment!
College debt and a rigged economy are the reason for all of these we were born into a broken economy so imagine how shitty you have to be to blame us for that.
Lol they think Millenials are a problem wait till Zoomers and Alphas become adults.
"Johnson's?" haha that guy is quick!
Millennials the biggest pussified generation of them all
STOP HAVING KIDS WE HAVE OVERPOPULATION! 

stops having kids: MILLENIALS KILLING MIDDLE CHILDREN!

trends are trends these articles are worthless
Aren't most millennials whole lives one big vacation? Cause all they do is waste money on worthless school instead of working hard.
are you seriously asking millenials to take responsability for something , good luck. lol
I am a hotel guy
Boomers are funny even generation X

I’m a millennial my grandmother is a baby boomer.And I don’t drink alcohol cause I care for my health
"I just think it's because we're not really thinking of spending money."
Are you sure about that?
Hooters is dying because the woman are not enough to eat their nasty ass food.
Millennials are killing the beer industry cause they can't get the same feeling heroin and pills give them. Millenials are also killing Science and Facts. They are the same lunatics who believe in infinite genders and Men can have babies.
Killing divorce. Its because they don't get married
Duh! No middle children because no sex is happening
Gen X would be there but we still could care less. lol
Gen z?
How about using actual millennials in a millennial titled video? We're in our 30s now,l. These kids are gen z.
Beer is dying because it tastes like piss
Johnson’s...is that a real place?? 🤔
I don't see vacation as something that's still kicking in the US. It's something that needs to be born. Tons of people have 2 weeks of vacation per year, which is pathetic. Studies show that people don't really truly relax until after 2 weeks of consecutive time off, so I'm glad that I live somewhere where it's a right to have 4 weeks of consecutive vacation during the summer, and 5 weeks minimum per year.


People that get proper time off, and that work reasonable hours, are both healthier and more efficient. European countries seem to be better at realizing that in general though. Working smarter, not harder.
Millennials aren’t killing any of this, it’s companies coming up with better alternatives and people taking them.

Why is that such a hard concept to grasp?
millennials killing vacation are you kidding me?
millennials makes vacation a priority rather than having their own house.
It amazes me that an entire generation was raised on the idea of moderation and to refute excess.  Then we get blamed for it.  Also, gimmie a craft single any day.
For the divorce thing, how would you know it is way to early to find out millennials are not even married yet and I know sadly there is a lot of divorce in the generation before millennials many of my friends have grown up without both parents in the household and it is sad to see. If it is true that millennials are killing this then that is very good.
Beer is my preferred drink. These articles are lies! All lies!
About the cheese thing yeah we don't recognize your GMO's and your chemicals you put in it and count them as ingridients.
Shocker! Millennials have no money to spend. Big if true.
It’s sad that you’re surprised about beer dying out, you shouldn’t have to be surprised about people not in taking a chemical that clouds their judgement
You guys should do millennials and gen z video.
Stop being a lazy journalist...if any spot here deserved an FBE TRUTH stamp....
Yes blame us all
This is stupid
Mose Allison wrote the Young Man Blues in the 50s, still true today.
What's gonna happen with Generation E (entitled)??
Boomers are the worst followed by the millenials who are a present day reflection of boomers. Gen X - the cool bunch all the way!
Yeah, on the subject of vacations...
Ain't nobody got time fo' that.
The most I can get at my job, is one week away time. And it's not like I can afford one anyway.
Back in the days of the ancient Greek philosophers, the older generation was calling the younger generation lazy for inventing the book. They claimed that they just wanted the knowledge at their fingertips, handed to them, instead of having to memorize it from scrolls. 
This sort of thing has literally been going on since the dawn of man.
7:39 Yeah of course we are! All the jobs we would have been looking at upon graduation all require a higher degree, or years of experience! Sometimes, BOTH! D:<
Libby is so hot
I'm a millennial and while I haven't found a woman I want to spend the rest of my life with yet, the day she and I are naked together and going at it will be the joyous day of my life so no sex is not dying.
Madison is so pretty.
About marriage im quite certain most men see it as a very raw deal, even if you love a woman and want to spend the rest of your life with her.
Its one bad move, one accident or one screw that came undone and you lose half your shit.
I think they mean big corporate beer is dying. I think most millenials just prefer local craft brews. I mean, have you tasted Coors...yikes.
Cable is definitely killing itself.
Boomers are responsible for 100% of all the things mentioned. To top it off, instead of acknowledging it, they say it died on its own. That's the response of a child. Boomers are the most irresponsible generation in history.
Fucking Peppermint Larry pisses me off for some reason. guy in the blue shirt
I speak for Gen-Z when I say Millennials suck.
I'm a millennial and I would love to own a house. However,  its ridiculously expensive
its not the millennial fault
being in a big family of 7 and seeing the hardship
how are the parents having hard time?
economical and mentally want to do parenting right the first time
As a millennial and certified alcoholic...I can say that we are definitely not killing beer and wine industry
It would be interesting to see a boomers×genZ video.
I’m a millennial and yes I think millennials are killing most everything lol I honestly I do
Congrats on graduating person graduating
I like how millennials are blamed for economic decisions not the people paying them.
Elders react to Kendrick Lamar DAMN album!! Lyric breakdown too!!
The more I think about it, you can't blame us for hooters. Every time I've seen a hooters chick the past 5 or so years, they were petite and not all that cute, combine that with average wings and hooters has lost the hook that brought people in the door
damn we get blamed for a lot of stuff
All of these people in the video are obviously leftist....
6:55 oof. That one hurt, im the middle kid of 3 😂 and i actually do want three kids.

11:36 true, i dont really watch cable TV anymore, mostly because what i want to watch is in a different language and I dont have the channels. I do, however, watch Disney with my mom because of new Disney movies that are coming out
Writers are killing my millennial vibe...
What about "millenials are saving the environment, respecting diversity, and giving a sh*t"?
What's a millennial? 


Note : I'm sorry I just do not keep up with the trends I'm still stuck in 1960 to 2016 (the only thing I keep up with is technology video games and movies) plus I don't really use social media that much I do have Instagram but i don't go on that much
Banks are killing the housing market, there aren’t any real jobs/careers that pay enough, everything is expensive, college is expensive (unless you have a scholarship under your belt). I blame the government and the banks, especially the federal reserve.
Are these people born between 80s and end 90s...? Because I thought people in that era are calling millennials??? 🤔
Millennials are killing sex. 
Sweats in asexual
Sounds like PC activists and a mismanaged economy are to blame for most of these. Millenials are a convenient scapegoat and diversion.
"Millennials are killing vacations"
No we just can't afford to take them
Millennial here that just bought a second house.. shrug 🤷🏼‍♂️
Man! What's wrong with us? 😂
me, a part of Gen Z
“Y’all mad? That’s cute.” *looks back down at phone
The kid thing stuck me as so funny I had my first kid at 22 and my 4TH at 28 lol I didn't wait to have kids and have two middle children lol
I've been to hooters once and they're dying on it's own because their menu is horrible. There is nothing appealing to eat. As for the waitresses, they're fine. But nothing exciting.
I think they're looking at big beer companies and seeing that their sales to Millenials is down, but there are so many craft beer places everywhere.
More wisdom, have your kids before age 35, birth defects start spiking after 35 and again at 40.
Gather 'round and hear this Wisdom!


Beer never comes in a can
Wine never comes in a box
Cheese never comes in plastic
Mustard is never bright yellow.
Milk is never pasteurized



I have bestowed a boon upon you, and you have been exposed to wisdom, go forth and be Wise!
My cousin has 6 kids with a 7th on the way and he's only 30. He's having enough kids for all of us 😂
Saying “millennials are killing”, really just means, “millennials have a higher expectation from business’ to not be shitty.”
“Eww not hooters”
“Johnson’s”?


“Ok maybe!”

Lol😂
I think it's so weird how millennials  are killing so many things I wonder what my generation is killing...
Best part of video. "Beer is fine" Baby Boomer commented. And than Corona Commercial pops up for 15 seconds.
Well to be fair boomers changed the country as well, killing off things their grandparents loved.
Am I the only one that thought it said io instead of 10
Millennials aren't killing beer. They're killing big beer. Everyone has a joke about the hipster with his craft beer. It's just more accessible to get specialized small Brew beers now. Which is good because they're better..
FYI, HULU IS OWNED BY A CABLE COMPANY! It was their answer to combat Netflix, that's why it's more expensive. They got you anyways sukkas!
Come eat at my new restaurant Butters coming soon to a location near you! I'm going to be so rich, cause ain't nothing killing objectification!
It's not guy millennials faults sex is down thats the girls fault
Can we have an episode where generations react to reading a full article and then discuss it?
Lol 🤩
Let's say millennials are to blame for all that, half of those things probably should die in a sense. Divorce being one of them since that means people are finding people they want to be with forever. Also how is sex dieing? Either 1 people aren't sleeping around which is good, or 2 millennials are keeping it low key which isn't bad since nobody should know what you do or don't do in the bedroom
It's a bogus question actually. Millenials killing things, and things dying off are actually the same thing. Things die off specifically because of the choices of that generation.
The beer industry is booming here in Ireland lmao especially craft beer. I'm not a fan myself but hey
Millenials clearly went overboard with outrage culture and pc culture and 3rd wave feminism, other than that our generation  is ok.
Im Gen Z so...😂😂😂
I want many many many children.
What's wrong with Hooters?
Those "kids" don't look 30-40. You guys do know "millennials" were born between 81 and the mid 90's, correct?
MAYBE
Most of these things I simply can't afford. I would love to go on a vacation if I could afford it. I would love to own a house if I could afford it. The problem isn't that millennials aren't spending money, we don't have any to spend! I work 30-45 hours per week. Even if I always worked the 45, I don't even qualify for the cheapest 2 bedroom apartment where I live.
I disagree on beer entirely. It might be because I live in a state with a booming beer industry, but I feel like millennials have BOOSTED beer culture, especially for craft beer and microbreweries. I've seen a rise in beer festivals, small-name brand recognition, and hobbyist beer brewers. It's as much an artform now as it is a business. But that's just me. I know my observations are not universal.
Who wrote this article?A eunuch?🤣🤣🤣
Yes we don't drink beer cause we smoke weed, we don't divorce because love died in 2016, we don't watch TV because Netflix (and the fact that TV is rubbish) and we don't buy houses because it's too expensive !
Its not news that one generation trashes on the next. It is news that the baby boomers are trashing on millenials instead of generation x trashing on millenials
That's not cheese, that's plastic
Millenial killing beer? the fuck my friends all drink and get drunk as fuck and I'm the only one who doesn't drink also killing sex ???😐😐 people nowadays just want to have sex😐😐😐😐
Johnsons? LMFAO
Maddie is gorgeous
Also the reason for most of these things dying is because of the crappy economy. If I could afford more kids, a house, vacations, etc I so would.
Youngest generations are like freshmen of high school.. they're the "newbies" and the "babies" so you pick on them and make fun of them etc etc. Like I'm sure the way millennials are currently treated is how boomers were treated at our age by the previous generations.
Generation z anyone?
Omg, this is so unfair to Millenials. like seriously! Stop blaming them for trying to be healthier, not spending that much money, and like not having 3 kids is not bad, I mean, overpopulation is a thing!
I'm 23... am I a millennial?
6:25






Me: 
What about doomers?
Boomers come from 5 kid families on average but they had 2 average. The less-than-two-kid family trend was started by boomers. They had a 2.5:1 ratio to their parents but saddled their kids with less than 1:1 (which has a profound impact on the economy, how could it not)
I like how it's so hard to live, this generation makes less money, we're killing these things we can't afford. Lmao
T-rash
T-RASH
Why do you NEVER highlight Gen Xers.  Considering we are the highest watchers
Hmmm i wonder why its so expensive to live these days thanks boomers. You complain that we're killing these things when you loaded the fucking gun and aimed the damn thing.
Millennials are using their mind and resources practically and not throwing money around. That's why businesses are mad.
Lmfao nobody ever thinks about gen x .
Came here for the spicy comments
Idiocracy lol Intelligent people don't want a kid
Millennials are not killing anything. Boomers are on the way out and so are their trends. Millennials are making their own, place.
They should ask the question is millennials rather have socialism than capitalism.
Any one of these people NOT live in California or New York?
GenX is TIRED of both of you.  We exist - and we’re more competent than any of you.
Millennials aren't killing vacations... corporate jobs are. I took 2 weeks off. I have had calls from work and had to help over half of my days off.
To sum it up we are poor and the wage gap between wages and housing is too big, the average person cant afford their own apartment anymore, or studio even.
😂😂😂😂😂
I appreciate that it's pretty well agreed by both groups that millennials either don't want to or don't have the means to be exploited by shitty industry practices, and that is why various markets are shifting so rapidly. Both the millennials and the boomers see this as a good thing.
I agree with Libby about the air b and b . I rather stay at a hotel then clean up someone else house. And I am a millennial.
Millenials and boomers. Awesome. Nevermind gen x. Ever. Yep.
"I wouldn't call it murder" lmao
Most don't seem to understand the question. "I think it died on it's own because people are different now"
Millennials want ass
For my 30th Brithday I went on holiday and got Drunk for two week.......  and I stand at a Hotel.
Big families were for farming
Madison is just the sweetest most gentle person
Jim is a millinial???
I love how FBE puts in those effects like the gunshot. If I was on that channel I'd do the most effect worthy things.
"Who wrote this article, a eunuch?" XD XD XD
P.S: Eunuchs were usually around in ancient China as people who had their things cut off and could have high positions of power and could serve as servants for emperor's wives since there was no chance of them having an affair.
Aren't millennials like 30
WE HAVE BARELY ANY FUCKING MONEY
Are millianials killing vacation....Christmas? wallyworld? vegas?  European?
Wait. First people scream that if you don't want kids, keep your legs closed. 
Now they are screaming about not enough kids because people are keeping their legs closed??
Like, honestly, what do you want from us?
leave Hooters alone I NEED my garlic hot wings where else am i suppose to get them dafuq
"Lets go to Hooters together" "oh.. not Hooters" "Johnsons?" "Maybe" ekeskesk
Why do they blame millennials and not Gen Z, they're arguably worse.
Boomers are killing the internet. Where is that headline?
Maid Cafe > Hooters
"I'll never get a divorce" 😂😂😂 okay bruh, see you in 10 years
I FUCKING LOVE HOTELS!
thank god I'm not a millennial
Ehat are millennials and boomers
"millenials are killing the beer industry" ....have y'all heard of college
Yes! Blame the customers is your business isn't going well! Totally the customers fault...
React on Game of Thrones season 8 memes!
Now this is a high quality video.


Screw those low IQ jackasses who quickly shift the blame on the Millennials.


Props to the thoughtful cast that debunked such nonsense.
I was hoping that the boomer and the millennial would have more time to discuss their opinions from their own perspectives
A big reason most millennials are broke is that they're just lazier overall compared to boomers. Today we have technology that just saps all of our time being unproductive. Also, college degrees should be used for high paying jobs (to pay off debts!), which is hard for many because they want to choose what actually want to do which ends up being some arts degree. I'm not saying that this applies to everyone and yes, living from nothing is way more difficult today but it's still possible if you have the willingness to work and study.
The sexual decline comes from modernization. The more developed a country gets the less kids people tend to have. It’s already happening in Germany and Japan right now. And about the hotel thing. Hostels are so much cheaper lol
Cable in Britain is still big with BBC ITV SKY Sports ant BT sports mainly because of football
So millenials are not watching enough TV?
God help us..,.
Millenials are killing most of these, though its often because of external factors
I don’t drink or consume sugar because  I’m afraid of type 2 beetus. Blame Wilford Brimley
Woooooow look at all the capitalist websites blaming the kids for the neoliberal problems
Oh man! No more hooters! Where are the pathetic losers that can't get laid without paying for it gonna hang out now. Lmao we get it you guys are "straight" i mean you say it enough and maybe it will come true
I haven't had a vacation in 2 years... so yeah
8:10 Well with advances in modern medicine having eliminated an actual need to have a lot of kids to guarantee that the family continues on, it's kinda dying on its own.

10:52 nah, government's killing it housing market through over-involvement, making it so expensive that it's just not practical for millennials.
Millennials are killing sex because we aren’t out doing it with everything that moves like our grandparents and great grandparents. It’s 2019, not the 60’s
Ethan fucks
The only way you could make an argument that millennials are killing beer would be that with the trend of micro and craft brews they are taking a bite of the large brewery profits, and that is why these articles even exist, some huge company can pay for them. That is the common line for all of these articles.
Millenials are killing beeeeeer?!!!?! 😂😂😂 come to france, everyone always as beer in their house, everytime I only see beer and vodka at party dudes lmao, but of course "we" don't drink everyday.

House are expensive... lmao, even if I would I can't afford them lol
People really call us millenials, for serious... hhh gud...
Paying for cable is stupid when there are websites to stream any show you want at any time
I see we're pretending gen X doesn't exist.  Again.  That's cool, we're used to it.  We'll just keep fixing ALL of your messes.
Us millennials arent killing cable. Its shit like Netflix and Hulu that are. Who doesn't want to watch their shows without commercials?
Pretty sure we all like sex...
100% right. Take those damn clothes off my girls in Mortal Kombat please
What age is considered millennial?
Millennials are a scapegoat for boomers
If Millennials get blame for everything what are people going to say about Generation Y .  Trends are always going always go up and down .
you had to cut the cheese 🤭
Millennials are killing FBE
Pay us more
I mean, statistically yes, millennials are having less sex it's the focus of Jean M. Twenge's work
In the children one, I would choose only 2 children because as a middle child, I have gone through so much bad stuff. Even though my sister have had problems with her mental, then my little brother have gotten so much attention because he’s growing, and my sister have gotten the rest of the attention because she’s getting older and high school and everything. That left me alone in my room with depression. Just because the others got the attention because I am the middle kid. So that is how it is for me. And as someone who have been hurt as a middle child, I don’t ever want any of my kids to suffer. No matter if that means I can only have 1 or need to have 6, I will NEVER let my kids through that hell. Btw, I’m now 13, but apparently my mental age is like 60 or 70 hahahha
We all know the baby boomers would all say yes if they were not with millenial
zip
There are many millennials in the comments who say they hate being blamed for everything and then turn around and blame baby boomers for everything.
Millenials killing the housing market? All I've been hearing and seeing is that the housing market is (metaphorically) killing the millenials because it's so expensive that they won't be able to afford a house until they're 50.
Change is always good, when you're the one making the change. Because of that, there'll obviously be people who are upset no matter what.
These fucking Millennials!😡😡
businesses: exist

millennials:
Most of these trends are from a terrible economy, most people can't afford kids, vacations, and houses. Most of my friends would want kids and vacations and houses but literally can't afford it- the desire is the same, but when everyone is working poor... I mean these companies are upset that we're not buying excess garbage but they don't want to pay us, give us stability, etc in the first place so what did you think was gonna happen? Most of the wealth is held by a few thousand people in stocks and other useless garbage. It's sad that journalists don't seem to care about that.
Millennial update. Airport just let me know that you're still 000% for tips today Millennials😕
the less sex thing isnt bad we are overpopulated anyway, we need to chill
its not dying because of anything its cause these businesses cant adapt to new markets
My husband is happy as a pig in shit 😂😂😂
1:41 when you laugh so you don't have to answer
Somebody tell the mexicans in NYC  that people are only having 2 children.  They never have less than 6.
Millennials are killing EVERYTHING. The Baby Boomers are stupid.
Love the chemistry of the people matched  for this video!
This is literally the definition of a free-market, capitalist economy, though.....

If a business doesn't resonate or entice enough customers, it goes under. Adapt or die. That's how the economy works.
No the interest and taxes write off isn't limited! Should it be? Yeah. We're killing trees and animals by expanding into new land when we should be redeveloping already cleared land. Source: am a homeowner with a big tax refund!

Can you do more videos like this, I think the concept of the 2 generations sitting next to each other and talking about "bigger" topics
I'd have multiple kids... if they're adopted. Millennials don't want to over populate the earth any more than it already is
Gen Y be like : well one thing you have in common is your both killing the planet
This is stupid period
0:52 that's why billie eilish changed her Instagram name
My question is who is 100k in debt for school and cant find a job??? What's your major??? I did a 6 month course and 15k in debt but I'm now making 80k a year... do your research on what jobs are needed and what will pay be like to budget for school loans
Putting Ethan and Catherine together was perfection
Beer brands are killing themselves.  it's the IPA trend.  too many microbreweries are investing too much in one type of beer.  it's the Irish potato famine all over again.
Just a couple months before graduating college I bought a house. I was 22. I’m on the lucky side though of not having $100,000 in school debt. It’s a better deal to buy a house than rent because you’re paying less & investing in something. I’m now 25, turn 26 next month, & I’m glad with the decisions I’ve made regarding buying a house, finishing my education, etc.
I’m a middle child.
People are are mad that millennials are not having sex, they aren’t being sexist, they aren’t drinking beer, they are eating healthy, they can’t afford a house, they don’t watch enough TV, they aren’t getting divorced enough and, they aren’t going on vacations. WHAT?!?
"Dont be a lazy journalist" do your research on your topics dont just blame it on millenials.
Most of the millenials didn't even think, they just prefer to say that's it's dying on it's own (even when it doesn't make sense) just to say that they didn't have any influence on those cases
Teens react to mean youtube comments lol
All this time I thought I was a millennial but i was wrong that 1981-1996 turns out 1997-present is post millennial and I was born in 1997 ugh i really thought i was a millennial.
1996 tail-end millenials gang unite!
14:49 I'll go to Hooters with ya... Nachos aren't that bad honestly
9:32 well if we could afford a house! lol but yeah, I might not even stay here in california
😂😂pew research 😂😂 6:57
The Millennials blame game is so old. Not everything's our fault when infact most country's being run by Boomers and Gen X.
Where's my Gen Z fam? (hint: people born in 1996-2011)
There the good boomers though so they don’t count as the other creeps all y’all!😂😂😂😂
I KNEW THESE WAS MILLENIALS!😁
So are boomers changing and on our side now or what all y’all?🥰
"Johnsons?" 

😂😂😂😂😂😂
Remember Millennials. The Automatic Gratuity was invented because of you cheap fucks. You'd order 500💰of food and leave the server fuck all. 😕
7:50 fuck california
How'd they get Bernie Sanders for this?
Millennial aren't killing anything, it's called the age of networking and technology....  XD this shits dumb
11:06 well cable industry was unofficially alive till end 2012 to 2013 in india thanks to jio all we do is streaming but killing cable hmmm
Saw on some dumb chart that a boomer was born until 1964? Boomers were driving GTO's, Mustang's and Camaro's in the 60's, they weren't being born. Had to be a Millennial who made the chart💣
Cost is everything and everything is getting more and more expensive with spending power of the people stagnating. So yeah, industries are struggling to stay afloat.
It is some boomers that screwed up the economy that force millennials to react and result in the society to devolve.
This is sad how this is now the question at all! Why is anyone even trying to relate this to a generational perspective. This is stupid
reporter sees a young person yawning

Article: "Millennials Are Killing Sleep"
On the note of business. If businesses are not looking 5 to 10 years into the future and looking into what is really pushing the future, then they are the ones killing themselves. Nobody else is doing it for them. You can honor the past and bring your experience and knowledge from the past into the future. However, clinging to it and refusing to change does not move a business forward.
You know whats kind of funny? Hooters is in decline but the rise of the topless coffee bar or in swimsuits is very much on the rise. Which is kind of funny as Blackmoore is calling Hooters sexist but these places wear so little it makes Hooters seem wholesome.
Us millennials aren’t killing anything.  We don’t buy shit food, and the economy isn’t anywhere near where any generation had it before. We are cutting down on things that aren’t up to standard. Also our parents raised us to to speak our minds and not grow up too soon. They didn’t pressure us to rush into having family’s and getting married at 18. At least my mom and dad raised me that way. They said travel world, you’re only young once.
Please react to Ateez
5:27 YESSS
Most of these are dieing because they're just to expensive for one person. The boomers could make a household run with only the dad working. Now renting a place to live is like $800 a month and jobs only pay like $12 a hour
Millennials aren't rich and everything more expensive
Boy you guys are not PG anymore!
So the killing the middle children, don’t we want less people? I mean, overpopulation
Lol I'm staying in a hotel right now
Dear lord, it’s baby boomers and older Gen X that are killing everything by fucking over the younger generations.
Every generation is different to the last. Both because times change and move on, and every generation is a product of the last. If I was raised by my grandma, I might have turned out like my mum, but I was raised by my mum, so I am as I am now.
"let's go to hooters after" 😂
“Millennials are killing beer” lol...idk about California but here we’ve had a million breweries pop up in the past year. Literally, they’re everywhere.
The economy and lack of wages meeting inflation are killing everything. Millennials were screwed before they were born. We cannot afford much of anything.
wow...all those headlines are just plain sad. xD I agree with the reacters on this one. There are more factos to something then just 'it's the millennials!' As for the vacation thing, I think Job Security plays a lot into it now-a-days. I swear I panic anytime I have to call in sick, thinking I'll be fired for having the flu, let alone asking for vacation. And even if I took a vacation, I don't really have the money to go do anything big thanks to school debt and bills. -_-
These are all lies made up by the media
Can I get Catherine's digits?
Damn Catherine 😂😂
"Waiting to long to have kids" 
I have seen people at like 16 that are like 4 months pregnant soo... pretty sure it's still kicking
Absolutely loved the boomer and millenial mash up. These are the conversations we need to be having. More please! Subscribed.
I'm a millennial and I want 5 kids with one of those 5 being adopted. I still have another 5 years until I'll have graduated and gotten my doctorate in Pharmacy. Probably won't get married until soon after that. I'll probably stay at my parents' house for a few years while I save up some cash to build a house on my family's farm in our rural county (good thing the prices in the rural areas aren't that bad right now).

As a Gen Z I can use a fuck buddy website to get laid. Also im sure the Beer Industry is ok in Germany mainly Bavaria
Who wrote this article a eunuch 😂😂😂😂 had me dead
Larger populations have always had lower birth rates, it has nothing to do with millennials
Millennials was just the worst generation and are fucking up the world for us generation zs
This was rlly stupid...
Typical daily diet for a Millennial. "Horton's" tripple tripple's 5 times a day along with 3 "Skip the dishes" orders☕🍔
Still waiting to see a Millennial buy groceries at Costco😕
The amount of confusion that people have about Generation X is astounding. For the last time: Gen X is BETWEEN Boomers and Millennials. They do not come after millennials. Generation Z comes after millennials. See, like this: 
Boomers
Gen X 
Millennials  (Gen Y)
Gen Z
Order of generations:
Silent Generation  (very few left)
Baby Boomers 
Generation X 
Generation Y (Millennials )
Generation Z
I'm a middle child...
Catherine seems to be flirting with Ethan! 😆
Pretty sure the only thing a Millennial is good at is playing with their phone☎😕
Also a lot of millennials are still young so things like buying a house or having kids are slow right now because is will probably rise later in their lives
This is why I'm glad to be Generation X (the ignored middle gen between Boomers and Millennials.).
The word millennial is actually stupid
Did you at least let them read the articles??
"I really respect millennials" Lol, is she senile?
I'll speak for all of Generation-X(1965-75) We fucking can't stand useless cheap fuck millennials. When's the last time one of you have ever tipped anyone. We know at the Airport you're batting 000%💰
Let’s not forget that most of these elders where part of the “Me” generation or “baby boomers” back in the 70s. Where teens would cause riots, smoke weed in public, and cause destruction. This was also the era of “rising unemployment among the young”
Most of this stuff is not a big deal, the only one that makes me kind of sad is the kids. Children are the future, and anyone who thinks it should be normal to have fewer than two children should ask themselves if they want to live in a country where the population is shrinking and can't sustain the elderly because not enough young people were born.
So what? I was born in 1996, so thats either Generation Z or Millennial, and couldn’t care less if us dudes are having less sex. I just like the decision of not wanting anything to do with other people in my life. The economy is trash and can’t afford risk losing my money to a divorce.
My love, Catherine is here. Yay! Coolest grandma. Boomers are our (millenials)parents.
Millenials are killing the beer industry? I mean have you been anywhere in Europe lately?
I'm pretty sure the actual statistics say millennials drink more alcohol than previous generations.
As usual, media completely skips Generation X, we don't exist according to media
.... that means it costs close to 13k a year to raise a child. That's a SHITLOAD of money. Also, finding people who WANT kids is a challenge.
Is Johnsons a male version of Hooters and is it real?
Jonathan was quite irritating in this video.
Choosing not to go anywhere on holiday is so fucked up.
Human activities can’t die ‘on their own’. Either one or multiple groups have to stop doing them.
TV died because they played stupid shows over and over and there was nothing to watch.
What is a Millennial actually any good at?
AirBnB is actually worse for the rental market than for hotels.
Even having two children is irresponsible. Having three or more is psychopathic.
No dairy cheese is a victim. It HAS victims.
Calling Jim a millennial is an extreme stretch.
This video gave me anxiety somehow 😂
All the headline are like saying vegans and vegetarians are killing the   meat industry then in the small print saying its cause they won't but meat, like yeah that's how supply and demand works don't blame me for not buying your crap, and killing implies that were attacking it when all were doing is not buying it lol
I’m just impressed that there actually were real millennials in this video and not gen z who the media portray as millennials. The oldest millennials are 39/40 and the youngest are 23! Often journalists seem to forget that most of themselves are millennials! 😂
What's still kicking?
I’m a millennial and only a homeowner because my dad died and I got life insurance money
The beer industry is fine, Millenials fucking love craft beers. Look at how many brewing companies there are now.
Millenials. Move out of your Parent's basement. Get a job. Stop jacking off while eating Cheetos.
Teens react to logic - homicide
How the hell is anyone gonna blame the housing market on us when we were literally children when it crashed?
Dear Thanos,

You were so right.
Best regards
Me
Microbreweries are swarmed with millennials though
Honestly, we're just poor. The rich are richer than ever and we're just crawling around at the bottom trying not to die. Also, despite having very fond grilled cheese memories, that shit don't taste right as a grownup. It's not cheese, it's just oil.
Why do we make broad generalizations about groups of people based off their age?
🧑🏾👱🏾‍♀️👧🏾
      ☝🏾
Me
I really don’t think it’s that serious.... Periodt!
I personally prefer hotels. 
Like what they mentioned: I don’t want the responsibility of taking care of somebody’s else’s house while I stay there, I want someone else to do it and I want to my own privacy instead of sharing. While the price of Airbnb or hostels are alluring, I’ll still rather be at a hotel.
@fbe millenials were born 1981-1996 per pew research... it seems that half your millennials were born after 1996 🤷‍♀️
I'm sooo confused can somebody explain this to me I have rewind paused to think and still dont understand.....ugh why do I got to be young.
How come Gen X is always lost in the shuffle...?
Latest victim, the Boomer
I am a middle child, and yes suffer all the traits that come with being two of three, and this touched me in a deep way.  Also Catherine is THE BEST
A lot of these are technology or the economy killing things, not millennials
Catherine is literally the sweetest elder ever ❤️❤️❤️
When you happen to be a gen z kid
Isn’t the “still kicking” and “no” pretty much the same on a few of these?
Fuck millennials.. The laziest sorriest generation... Get off the fucking couch and Facebook and live a little, dipshits.
“Well they’re killing avocados 🥑 at a very fast rate.” Accurate. Lmao 😂
12:39 That was nice. That’s the type of editing I like, not too much but something to surprise you every now and then...
The generation with hookup apps are killing sex? Yah no
Here retailers are not even allowed to call that cheese. Good step in the right direction US
4:26 the article SPECIFICALLY SAYS that the younger generation is drinking more WINE and spirits instead of beer. Ok after watching this whole video, I have an issue with just about every claim stated. As the reactors were saying, trends go up & down. Housing markets go up and down. I will say tho that millennials are making very different choices than ppl from previous generations
As a middle child I’m happy people aren’t having three kids anymore. That way they get to love all their kids equally instead of loving their oldest and youngest and then giving the middle child hand me down clothes that are way too small and making them do all the chores. Looking at you, Mom and dad.
4:18 when you’re trying to say something but your friend keeps talking
These answers are bogus you can't ask people questions when the opposing party is inches away this should have been two separate videos then edit together then we would see there real answers
And again.. no attention or love for generation x
DATA: "Less sex" Reactors: "Nananananaananananananananananana"
3:52

“Millennials aren’t drinking enough beer..”
Yeah as if beer didn’t cause enough heart disease
I can see a few cross-generational barebacked fuck sessions going after this video was taped.
"Well they're killing avocados at a very fast rate"


That was actually hilarious, well done mam
The middle children, I say its still kicking because my cousin wants ten kids
Everything dies just not fast enough
Hooters was already dying.... Huhhhhh????????????
Like they said, a lot of factors come into play. Specifically, the economy, values, education etc. What serves one generation does not serve another. Millennials are a product of our environment and our environment is more expensive, we’re more educated, heavily in debt, more on the move, more conscious of healthier food and a healthier environment (considering we have to save the planet).
"Or, sadly, it could be that not as many people are getting married"
And what's wrong with that? That doesn't necessarily mean people aren't getting into life long relationships, it just means that more people are realizing how incredibly stupid it is. Even if you don't have big fancy wedding, you're still paying to get married. I mean, what's the point in this piece of paper saying you're "official"? If people like the sentiment it shows and all that, good for them, but there's nothing wrong with people deciding that them and their partner are just fine without marriage. There's nothing sad about it. My dad and step-mom only got married because there were benefits for them, because they're older and my step mom has a job that will cover eye and dental insurance for the whole family. If it weren't for that, I don't think they would've gotten married.
I guess someone should teach millennials some manners. Dropping f bombs in front of grandma is not cool bruh.
Soooo very political. I like you much better when you stay neutral FBE. Stick with the laugh challenges and reacting to amusing things.
millennials are killing... me
seriously i’m in a back ally and a bunch a tiktokers are beating me up help please HELP ME HELP AHHHHHHHHHHHH
Millennials are being blamed for everything just because nobody wants to face the fact that the economy isn't in favor of the younger generations. We're told to keep our legs closed, but there isn't that many kids. Told to buy diamonds and houses when we have $1K in debt from college. We've found cheaper and more efficient ways to live our lives and if other people don't cater to our needs, we'll figure out ways to do it ourselves. They were warned when the internet became a huge profit in the early 2000's.
Millenials are killing journalism.
I'm so confused as to why this popped up 😂
"Let's go to Hooters together"  "Uhhh" "Ok, Johnsons?" "Maybe"  Johnsons, the male version of Hooters really needs to exist, lol.
Summary of all the articles "Millennials are broke, and have more options. More news at 12."
I actually laughed out loud when the guy said “who wrote this article? A eunuch?” 😂
Millennials probably don’t want kids so they have less sex
Regarding house prices it's because of the continuous population growth of cities and suburbs - places people want to go and live. More people and less available space puts a premium on housing and prices go up. Supply and demand.
The problem isn't because of a specific generation, but on centralisation.
I call that government cheese that shit is nasty.
Do it the other way around aswell! :D
Why is it always the « young millennials » that are used to represent the generation? In 2019, millennials are actually between 23 and 38 years old. I doubt any of your millennials here are in their thirties except maybe one that looked past 25.
It just keeps feeding this idea that millennials are all young and have no experience with life yet. That just shows how people critiquing this generation knows nothing about it.
Millennials can't afford children, we have high interest and predatory student loans
Millenials aren't killing beer, the big brands are dying because people are opening their own breweries and making better beer. Not only that, craft breweries are popping up everywhere and offering even more variety. Beer isn't dying, it's simply expanding to include more than, like, 10 main brands.
Now the beer industry is on a decline and it is because a lot of millenials are steering more towards wine and liquor but you went and changed the question the article doesn't say millenials are killing wine so how does that become part of the question
Old saying is ur only as happy as ur saddest child ..........wish I had a dad like him he must b a great dad
Okay, okay. Here's one:
Are millenials killing the YouTube comment section?
The last one doesn't make any sense
The divorce one was an Amy Klobuchar tweet LMAO.
i do agree on cable! i have an apple tv and that is all i use.
This is actually a perfect representation of society, all these people are just giving their opinions on an article after literally only reading the Header and some random fucks tweet
Bet that "Millenials are killing the beer industry" doesn't apply in South Africa. We drink that that stuff like it would be our last time. It's booming this side for us
Of course Millenials escaping their responsibilities, as always :D
The killing sex one, might have something to do with the middle children one. I think a lot of families with 3+ kids, got that way because the sex rate is higher. I mean, you're pushing the statistics, when you have more sex, right? 😇😘
Is anyone going to ask how millennials are killing middle children when they haven’t even gotten to the age to have three children??? 🤔
This video is fucking stupid.................. Videos LIKE this are fucking stupid..................
It's not millennials fault it's feminism.
The boomers are blaming the Millennials for everything when the Boomers are the ones that raised the millennials. My parents would beg me to do chores but when I would do them they would be like you're not doing it right get out of the way and let me do it myself
shakes cane
"Dadgum millennials!"
Lmao Hooters girls don't even have Hooters anymore a bunch of flat chested high school girls of course there dying people don't wanna see babies trying to look grown up to soon
Why do we act like GenX doesn't exist? My grandma is a boomer, born right after WWII ended, my mom was born in '67, then I was born in '91. Maybe some boomers waited to have kids in their 30s who are now millennials (in which case, don't blame millennials for waiting to have kids), but most millennials parents are GenX.
A lot of these article topics have more to do with economic factors, shifts in cultural trends, and differences in the lifestyle preferences of the social classes. I think all "blame millennial" articles can be sorted into one of those 3 categories for explanation.
So many of what millennials are blamed for are mostly because of the economy.... we can’t go on vacation because we don’t have money, can’t buy a house because we don’t have money..... the economy is a huge issue so everyone’s gotta stop blaming newer generations for the downfall when some were in diapers while things were going south
Millenials are more likely to be Snowflakes--more likely to be more easily offended and politically correct and insistent on political correctness. And millenials and babyboomers aren't the only two generations in existence.
Elders react to RWBY trailers, please.
1:59 come on, JOSH 😂
Boomers destroyed the climate.
"sex is just fine" yes if you get a written document by the female you want to have sex with and she agree otherwise they will drag you down to hell making your life a hell. they can change their minds even if it's done
The beer industry thing is just so silly! Crafted beer brewers are growing all over the place! Now a days, You can find an enormous variety of beers!
Baby boomers are just as dumb as millennials.
The millenial left are modern day Puritans..... straight out of the 30s/40s. Its amazing to see.
5:15 That cheese is shit
When I saw this a few days ago I saw a bunch of comments saying “oh typical millennials not taking responsibility for anything.”
Are you serious? The articles are talking about Millennials killing DIVORCE! THE PROCESSED CHEESE INDUSTRY! OTHER STUPID THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER! They shouldn’t take responsibility for those things because 1: THESE THINGS ARE DUMB AND STUPID and 2:  Literally they ARE dying on their own. 
And also in addition: processed cheese is allowed to have a MINIMUM of 50% real cheese. I’m not sorry to say that I don’t want to put that shit in my body and none of you should either.
I remember when Gen X was going to destroy the planet!?! Breathe, life will go on.
Baby boomers and millennials.. what about Generation Y 1965-1979?
I agree this girl 10:00 she hit the nail on the head, if colleges were more affordable people would be putting more down payments on bug things like houses or cars,. Thats why i feel that lots of the things that are supposedly dying from millennials, are dying from the way the economy changes cause that effects the money flow of us millennials. Same thing with the 2 children one, you have to be like a millionaire to support 3 children plus a house and a car. Living financial conditions in D.C for the last 5 years have tripled from what they used to be. If things weren't so pricey all these things would be more attainable.
Early Happy Graduation, Ethan! Huge kudos to you man
We're just now in the ending phases of "the great recession" which is our version of the 1940s depression.  Of course people are going to be poorer and have less children during this last decade.
No body can afford big family’s... come on.. no one can afford a house in my city never mind children
I have netfkix, i have the internet. The news on tv is unrealiable. I can eatch anything ehich is on tv onlinr at my own convinence. There is no point of cabel tv apart from sports and even that can be acsessed online.
The label "Millennial" has been given to pretty much every young person these days instead of just people born between 1980 and 1994.  The "metoo" movement is killing sex.
No, the children one is very accurate, many do not want children
There was actually a study done showing that an increase in the use of technology has led to a decrease in teen pregnancies so the first one is partly true
My parents are baby boomers, this is weird, this people are too old to be baby boomers
Im a middle child and i serioudly hope i dont go exctinct.
Ngl, I do miss Hooters. They had some damn good food.
Millennials are poor asf, that can't afford accidental pregnancy or getting addicted to shit they don't got money for

React to Hurts 2B Human!

Also I'd say millennials might be killing the limited skill / trade skill jobs involuntary because I feel  they were raised that blue collar jobs are lower class jobs and  if they didn't get a less physically demanding job your not as valuable.
I'd say millennials are killing the big beer industries I'd say the small craft beer scene is big though.
"You're only as happy as your saddest child" I bet he was such a good dad :D
NAH TV IS STILL KICKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TOO MANY STREAMING SERVICES!
Millennials are not real or bomers. Everyone is different. You can not group people together who are not the same. That would be like putting apples and oranges together and saying they are all apples.
To be honest, not millennials killing most of the thing lol economy does..
Bull my dad had me at 19 my mom had my oldest sibling at 20

Hotels just suck and are way too expensive...

Wait...too big to fail banks aren't to blame for wrecking the housing market??  Or capital accumulation of the 1%?
Killing the beer industry...they've revitalized it by making it through micro-breweries...big companies might be less popular...but that's good.
#killingit
The average millennial in my area is only making 30k a year. So, maybe we are killing everything but, like she said, it’s the economy. We can’t afford Jack shit!
Maybe cheap domestic beer like Budweiser and Coors but definitely not craft beers. Another thing baby boomers sucked at, making beer! We millennials also love cheese. We just enjoy real cheese not that processed crap over-loaded with artificial flavors and preservatives.
Marks got a serious tan
Considering how much they drink and how constantly they are f*** everything neither sex or alcohol have no problem
Just because people dont spend money in their companies, does not mean you get to blame it on milenials.
Buying a house used to represent freedom to do whatever you wanted with your property and assets. Buying a house now is like locking yourself into a contract to stay in the same area for a long time and losing out on advancing a career or moving in general.

The argument shouldn't be if Millennials are killing this or that but what  is causing Millennials to not want to engage in very financially burdensome activities. Income and wealth inequality in the USA has exponentially skyrocketed due to the rigged economy that we have we're politicians favor corporations!
Usually I don't mind these videos, but I feel like these people don't know anything. They have no clue!
React to the new sonic the hedgehog trailer!
In a lot of these examples, it seems like millennials are learning from the mistakes of previous generations and we’re finally seeing the results of a more collectively conscious society where more people are going to be able to live their best life. Just because it’s not what the previous generations are used to doesn’t mean that it’s wrong.
Johnson's  lmao 🤣😂🤣😂
Tbh if millennials are "killing" sex its because they're less likely to get into relationships and more likely to casually date. People who casually date have less sex than those in relationships (especially when you're busy/barely see the people you date).
So millennials are keeping up with technology and doing what they can afford.
Anybody else laugh when they say BOOMER, like fuck dude chill. Imagine being called a BOOMER.
such B.S. everything isnt dying on its own, the millenials are choosing other things hence the reason they are dying. plain and simple.
Cable networks better hurry up and get themselves online, TV will be dead in 5-10 years Max
And Gen Z is Bringing a lot of this back lol
Millennials are NOT killing vacations! If anything millennials are traveling for luxury more than ever!

Millennials are fucking, but they aren’t producing
Why isnt gangster granny on this? Now that would be amazing and would definitely be good for views too! Love her
I'm kind of sick of all the excuses being that millennials can't afford it. I'm a millennial, I'm married own my house and I make a decent living with no college education. These millennials have these issues because they live in huge cities where cost of living is super high.
In other countries we call it plastic cheese
We are number one but as long as u can wathch
I’m on that weird cusp between a Gen Z kid and a Millennial so🤷‍♀️
Millennials basically are trying to cling to life as long as possible, because who wouldn’t want to live a healthy life where you end up with dementia back in a nappy 😒
Lol
Cable is totally dying on it's own. 85% of my entertainment actually in fact comes from YouTube. Very rarely do I watch tv anymore
Millenials aren't killing the beer industry, they're killing the BIG beer industry.  Look at the craft beer movement in the USA.
If you were aware of Y2K you are a millennial is that a fair benchmark?  I hear 97, 99, 95 but I am not sure that there is a set standard recognized by most everybody.
So what I'm gathering is that all of these accusations are either positive, or cases in which baby boomers are blaming us for the fact that the economy they created is now crashing and burning and we aren't trying to put the sorry thing back together in the same way in which it was given to us.
How are Millenials killing the housing market? The reason we aren't buying homes and living with our parents is because the baby boomers crashed the housing market in 2008 and crippled the economy. This is a product of their doing. Not sure how we are getting that blame?
Aren’t Milennials like 30 now?
Did you ever think millenials are having less sex because they're asking for consent...?
I didn’t know that, as a middle child, I’m now considered an endangered species 😂😂
You know, we have an overpopulation problem? Having less children is probably a good thing.
We are number one but its how long can you watch!!!
Some of these things shouldn’t be blamed on millennials though. Like the one about vacations. Has it ever occurred to you that maybe they can’t afford it.  I’m Generation Z but I feel sometimes people just want to blame millennials overs things that’s they can’t control or that isn’t their fault
Houses are so expensive now tho. I feel like that’s a factor.
Tbf they are in denile
For a lot of these I think it’s the economy not necessarily just millennials
What is it going to take for people to realize that these teens are millennials. They are gen Z.
So many of these things are not necessarily negative. Stuff like buying a house, not having at many kids, etc, why is that inherently a bad thing if the alternatives align with and serve the individual persons’ life? A society and the economy changes with the wants/needs of the public, resources, trends, etc. Also take into consideration of the constant widening gap between the upper and lower classes... all of the blaim the millennials get is so misguided
I’m a middle child...
I'm gen Z so yee
I don't understand why the beer was pinned on millennials. The majority of my friends don't drink and party till their throwing up. We're getting smarter and therefore we're not putting ourselves in situations where we can get into trouble. 
Girls you know what I mean. 
But a lot of these things are good "problems". Even though I'm a part of Gen Z I'm happy to say that all of us are the reasons for these things even if it's NOT US SPECIFICALLY!!! But I read through the comments and all of what I've seen is true. It's technically not our fault.

Thanks for listening to/reading my small rant.

EVERYONE WHO READS THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
The only reason why cable died is because it's really expensive and inconvenient, we ditched cable since like 2010
Millennials are killing free speech and Capitalism

Change my mind.
Way to fuck us over boomers
Love how half the stuff Millennials are supposedly killing, they just can't afford.
Killing vacations? They just can't afford to go on holiday every year.
Killing the housing market? They can't afford to buy a house.
Killing divorce? They can't afford to get married in the first place.
Of course media doesn't want to turn round and say "oops, we fucked up the economy big time and now a whole generation can't afford the things we took for granted"
When stuff goes wrong, they always blame millennials 😑
Actually  millenials  are 39 to 19 that 1980 to 2000 look it up
Asobi Asobase!!!!!
Millennials  are killing free speech
🤣🤣 i agree with the we're killing avocados because i eat 1 or 2 every single day🤣
Gen Z here
Ok can we stop calling 18 to 25 year olds millennials. They are Generation Z. Real millennials don't have mooooneyyyyyyy that's why stuff ain't happening anymore.
We need a video showing all the things boomers screwed up back then. From the Afghanistan war to the Iraq war
Let’s go to HOOters together
before a few generations ago entire families lived together grand parents down to grandkids lol millenials are just unknowingly going back to that time.
so much bs ...
stop i9t - federal reserve did it
Maybe the younger millennials. But there are sometimes a 10 year or more age difference between millennials and that make huge difference. Millennials in their 20's grew up differently from millennials in their 30's.
“Johnson’s” 💀💀💀
Shout out to all my middle child brethren we rare now
The other thing we didn't consider: contraception. In the past 10 years, birth control and other methods of contraception have gotten better and a lot easier to come by. So there may not be as many "accident" kids. My grandmother had 7 siblings, and my mom only has 2. Now-a-days if you want to have kids, you go off birth control, and if you don't want kids you stay on the pill, or shots, or some other kind that is more effective. I wouldn't say wanting 1 or 2 kids is a bad thing, but there aren't as many "accident" kids when women are in their 30's anymore.
"is this true? What's wrong with you?"
"ha... Ha ha... Ha. Ha ha. Ha"
Millennials and gen z just have different standards for their life since of how they see the world and the economy.
Article Writers: "Let's blame everything on the millennials..."
Me: "I'm pretty sure my sister drinks beer more than I do, I'd say it's Gen Z's fault."
Article Writers: "Yeah but millennials are popular right now so we're gonna say that."
It's not up to the consumer to keep the business ..in business -_-
females in my families got mountains..but..  I'm naturally cardboard smh 😂😂

I'm glad though.. 😂 they're in my wayyyy
@8:08 this is the correct answer to all of these questions
The big thing with buying houses back then was that one could OWN property, and the market was all about having your own property and putting investments on it to later cash in. Nowadays, buying is super expensive and often times not worth it since a lot of the younger generations are either renting, joining the military, and/or can't afford the buying prices. I don't see anything wrong with the younger generations wanting to do their own thing, but it's such a big deal to the older generations since millennial's and gen z's are dropping a lot of the older traditions in favor of modernizing.
It's hard to let go of past traditions and how things used to be, but with today's economy and ever changing market, people kind of HAVE to make more money wise decisions considering the cost of a decent education and other necessary things. Interest piles up, so what's the point of buying something that'll cost you an organ later on in life?
sex decline is good, overpopulation problem is  going away
In my opinion, all of them seem to be good things

Baby Boomers created the world that millennials are trying to live in. Boomers made it harder for millennials to get housing, finances etc and blame them for the reason industries are dying out
Stop blaming millennials for everything. Some of them are doing good in the world.
Millennials aren't killing the beer industry. At least where I am from small batch breweries are taking off. There are at least 7 that I can think of that have good sales where I am from.

Y'alll millennials are old. Where are the 2000's kids at? 2010's kids, not welcome.
For everyone who wants to know what millennials and boomers are:
Millennials are born before  the new millennial so between the 1980 and 1999, while the boomers also cald baby boomers where born between 1946-1964 so after the second world war when the baby rate was growing again.
Also are the millennials known as 'Y' Generation as for Y=why because we are always asking our self or others why we have to be like that or do that or eat that. As for the cheese we are thinking more about what to pack in to our body's.
Houses are expensive, having a family is not in the cards for me at this points.

1. Machine took human's job.
2. Most people have access to Internet.
3. Dopamine you get from using Internet (social media, video, music ect) replacing other entertainment.

It's always new technology made by previous generation that changes the next generation, just like when human inventing TV, firearms, nuclear weapons, iPhone, lamp, radio, metals crafting, satellite, ect.

That made my day
I'm a millennial and I've done none of this.
Besides you can't just generalize a groups of people like that. :/ 
 But i suppose this information is interesting

What is Johnson’s 😐?
The two that bother me the most are millenials killing the housing market and vacation. Those aren't effected by millenials directly at all and the reasons are simple. If you want to equate the fact that millenials aren't buying houses to the market dying, sure. Go ahead. But the real factor behind what's preventing millenials from buying is the dramatic economic inflation over the years and how wages have failed to keep up. If you don't have money, you can't afford to buy things... As for vacations. Millenials aren't killing the concept of a vacation, they just can't afford to take one. Again, it's another thing that's happening because of a lack of money. Those who DO earn vacation time are often using it to supplement their income rather than actually taking the time off. This isn't about entitlement, it's just the facts...
Can you do a react to Ateez?
What are these low IQ takes? These people dont represent me.
Haha Phil, my man.

Wow, this is so informative! I never thought of these gaps on generations and how we behaved before and now.

We are becoming overpopulated anyway
Try doing that without bommers and millenialls in the same room and you will see a different reaction. Why would you even do that.
There's only 2 genders don't @ me
Please do cats react it was so funny!!!! I miss it!!
They're killing comedy
I feel like Gen Z is very different from millennials... we are more tech savvy and have a wayyyy stronger drive and work ethic. Gen Z has a lot of future innovators. (Btw I’m talking more like 1998-2005 because after that you get into the tide pod eaters and fortnite dancers)
Hold on that second yes was miscounted and should be no🤦🏿‍♂️
I believe that almost all of these are millennials getting blamed for things that SHOULD be getting blamed on shitty business practices and corporate greed causing a bad economic trend. For instance, I would LOVE to go on a vacation, stay in a hotel, maybe get married buy a house and all that good shit... but the job I work at pays $11-$13/hr  oh but 15 years ago at the same place doing the same job they were paying $30/hr+. The reason I don't "find something better"? Because it's still one of the better paying jobs in the area. Companies are moving to the "raise prices and cut wages" thing and yeah, it may save them money and make their investors happy in the short term but this whole thing is hanging on by a thread....
millennials are beyond weird when it comes to social media
Most people have 2 children but my parents have 4.
I always found it funny in a way, that most of the older generations always called younger generations rude, disrespectful, lazy, etc., when in fact the older generations are way ruder, more disrespectful and whatnot.
did she just say "millennials are more conscious about what they're putting in their bodies." is she crazy.
I loved this video! Love seeing the bridge between two generations.
I love Phil.  "Let's go to Hooters together", lmao.
i'm gen x...we just sit back and watch the world burn....
Shame i have not be lumped up with people like Jeannie Who kids her age have to grow up with having to have the new and most expensive cell phones lol i grew up with the lat 80s and 90s and we didnt even have cells back then lol we wanted to have fun we played outside
Gen Z is the superior generation!
I have 2 sisters and I’m the middle child
I'm born 2003 (15 years old)what am I??
Ok. As a 28yr.
1. Sex is amazing.
2. I don't see anything wrong with Hooters.
3. I don't drink anything. So No NOT everyone likes to drink.
4. Cheese is awesome ahaha.
5. And yes I DO AGREE with the kids ones. I do not WANT kids at ALL. I think people are realizing if you can't take care of yourself why the hell would you have kids?! I think it is a dumb idea to have kids in this world right now.
6. I know what a hotel is I wouldn't want to stay at some stranger's house honestly.
7. I don't think they we are killing the house market. Houses are expensive as HELL now! I'd love my own house but damn it is so expensive. 
8. Tv is killing itself. It to expensive.
9. I can't wait to get married. But do not want to jump into it.
10. What? We can't  AFFORD A VACATION!!! WHO CAN??
11. We are treated unfairly but every new gen gets blamed for bs that is not their fault.
"You're only as happy as your saddest child." Hit me hard because I've been struggling a lot with mental health lately... That kinda just kicked me in the pants just now. I've got to seek help, not only for me but for the sake of my mother.
It's not that people dont want to hire millenials, it's that people dont want to hire someone with a worthless degree like gender studies or some nonsense.
Am I a Millennial if I was born in 1996? Im a confusion :/
I’m Gen Z by a year difference lolol
I try to hug a millennial every day, then she screams and says "what are you doing in my apartment?!"
The middle children one is stupid lolll
The market is killing millennials.
I am a millennial and I prefer hotels.

And I also have cable.

so have we decided what ages or yrs do milennials cover?
< Gen Z
12:39 🤣
I hate I was born a Millennial
LoL that avocado comment is so funny
Madison looking like an aunty.
Millennials aren’t killing the beer industry; they are just killing the big name beers like bud, coors, and miller. Cause those beers are sucky piss water. They are drinking craft beers and beers with better flavor instead.
I will tell you this. The military population is definitely still popping out those kids at a young age. Hey when the cost of having a child at the hospital is free and you get free housing there really isn’t anything stopping you 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️😂😂
Millennials are the worst generation

Change my mind
2:40 “ we’re still having it “ 😂
1:32 - lmaoo ily Phil

Ok but Gen Z is killing my will to live
my like for the video is for the last scene with Jonathan and Phil
Damn Phil
I take vacations.  I just refuse to take those God-awful cruises or to go to a  cheap looking resort.  If I'm gonna pay that much money to do something it's gonna be on my terms not someone else's

I also heard millennials are killing children too. Because we have the audacity to have them when we feel ready financially and if we are in a relationship. No seriously the article was mad millennials aren’t marring enough and child birth was down and argued that if millennials don’t reproduced fast enough their be a shortage of people like China has right now. They equated personal choice with China’s state sanction child policy debacle.... let that sink in.
I'm Generation Z.
Millennials are killing movies too
Millennials are also killing the comedy industry.

The corporate economic structure was built on fiscal growth which depends on the growth of a population and what they financially contribute towards the economy. I say let the corporations die. 

This is just a ploy to guilt millennials into spending more money.
yall have to do elders react to GhosteMane
a lot of this stuff has to do with were just not making enough money to live therefore we cant afford vacation children hotel rooms or even to go out on dates to find that special someone to be a wife to divorce later and then we dont want to divorce because financial nightmare
Please teens/adult reacts to LOONA or IZ*ONE!
Housing is too expensive imo. Its easier just to get an apartment.
ITS SO FUNNY TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN OPINIONS BETWEEN THESE PEOPLE AND SOMEONE WHO DOESNT LIVE ON THE WEST COAST.
the middle child thing is a yes its hard enough to take care of yourself let alone 1-3 kids and that plays a huge part on inflation with out wages going up
Mileniall dont want to have 3 kids THATS ME I JUST WANT TI HAVE 2 😂😂
Funny my friend has 4 children
NAHHHH FUCKKK THAT I LOVEEEE CHEESEEE!!!! ONLY YOU LA PEOPLE ARENT EATING CHEESE... WHO THE FUCK DOESNT EAT CHEESE? WTF LOL
It makes me sad when people who drink “cant do beer”...WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?
i’m not a millennial but the economy isn’t their fault cause millennials are stuck paying for the boomers
Most of this is all caused by bankers and government killing the economy and raising the cost of living, its a result that these things are in decline of that than just millennials causing it. . . lol 

same here in the UK too.
I'm a millennial and I can see Air bnb is big because it is cheaper then hotels and they take vacation when they can afford it since everything is much higher cost then it was with he boomers. Rent, car note, and student loan are way more. Then Hooters are killing themselves with high cost they are decent wings but we go to more mom and pop places because it tastes better.
this was actually a really good segment.  some of the narrative brought forward was ridiculous but most of these reactors all woke and didn't really buy into it like some do.  nice moves FBE
The economy is actually killing a lot of these topics not millennials.
The old guy: “WHAT”
i feel like a lot of the industries that millennials are "killing" just aren't keeping up with the times. millennials want newer better products so we go to newer better services, the fact that traditional industries can't keep up with the demands of a new demographic is their own fault lol. also nobody wants to have kids in a world that's dying and progressively getting worse,
Can we get some stronger views? 
Less snowflaking and tip toe-ing around the shit?
ahhh, the two worst generations xD
7:24 :)
I'm the oldest  of three
Despite most of these articles needing 16 quotation marks, this was a very interesting episode to tackle.
We're killing the shitty beer industry. Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Natty - maybe if you made beer that didn't taste like kangaroo piss, we'd drink it?
The Governement is killing all of these... High housing price. High gas prices no vactions... it all leads down to the Governement they just trying to put a blame on someone else then themselves
What about millennials are dumb
not our fault that cable is shit🙂
4:00 he’s on to us.
Let's go to Hooters together 😂
Why is everyone mad at divorce, it's the way out of many bad situations
These answers are nothing but millennial lies.  Hooters was a very high paying job, these kinds of income are vanishing.  Low marriage rate, drop in birth rate. In fourty years, no money for their social security.  So they become homeless or four parents move in with their one kid & spouse.
That fingergun effect was too good...
Ah yes we're killing the housing market, not the other way around nonono what an absurd idea
Wow! Journalists are so out of touch.
They should have had - Millenials are killing off shitty writers...

So are we just going to ignore the “Johnson’s” comment at the end 😂
Madison is literally glowing
One thing this video proved is : Millennials are definitely oversensitive/easily offended.
We’re at 7.5+ billion. I really don’t think the world could handle anymore humans.
Beer is still kicking ffs ... how many artsy fartsy beers are out there
youtubers reacting buttered side down !

It is too scary to have kids in this world and everything is way too expensive
Philosophy Tube covers the housing crisis very great. https://youtu.be/qihG6AGjkRk
Typical mainstream media... Always looking for someone to blame when their profit or news is low. I'm sick of businesses and economy blaming the millennials for a drop in sales. In big booming cities with a high economy, prices are expensive for welfare. The people that are trying to get good jobs can't get them because they need a specific skill that needs to be paid to be learned in expensive colleges. College tuition prices keep getting worse by the year, and it ain't easy to try and pay off student loans and debt. The people that do graduate can't even enjoy it for a hot minute, because they have a debt to pay off, which totals to over thousands. We wouldn't have time to think about buying houses, we're trying to make ends meet. If they want more real estate, lower the payment, but don't go blaming the millennials, blame social and political economy.
10:25 ... I yawn like this all the time haha. Nice way to not be disrespectful.
This is really just capitalism contradicting itself like Marx said.

Sounds like an unsustainable economic system that is raising prices while lowering wages. And millenials are out here eating ass while on coke, HRT and LSD.
Arnt millennials 28-40 years old?
Are millennials killing physical books for digital ones instead? That’s the debate I wanna hear. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Cable is too damn expensive that’s why it’s dying.
Haha they dude said he’s never gonna get a divorced lol until your wife wants to divorce you lol

Why does everyone in the media ignore Gen X'ers?  That's not fair!  lol
Not all millennials are bad FFS! The oldest ones are in their effing 40s! It’s the “Tom Holland to Chris Evans” age range! 😑😡😒

Boomers are why everything is crap now, and Gen Z is having everything handed to them.

Please remove your video titled " Generations React To Taylor Swift - ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco)

Always blaming the young generation for things. It's a bunch of BS
We are considered "lazy" for not having jobs and for not moving out of the house soon enough but our economy is so messed up we can't find jobs, don't make enough money, and can't afford to buy a house.
Boomers
4:22 liquor mixes and private/small brewers are more what might be driving down patronage of "big beer" (Budweiser, Coors, Labat, etc.). Granted I don't drink at all but this seems to be more the case amongst my friends.
Aren't these kids Gen Z? Old Gen Z, but still Gen Z? Or are they super young Millenials? Zennials? I thought Millenials were like... 25-38 now?
What are millennials?
As a millenial, we are killing a lot of stuff. The baby boomers have all but hit retirement age while neo-boomers are about to start entering their 50s and prepare for their retirement and exit from society. Trends, customs, and traditions are based on the generation that is in the main spotlight, and that so happens to be us millenials. We are killing housing, food, restuarants, vacations, etc because we have an entire different outlook on life and want to mold society to out standards. Why keep eating food filled with junk? Why go to resturants with subpar food? Why spend $400k on a house less than 2k square feet?
Most of the shit that millennials r being blamed for is just shit that was already not a good thing to begin with or straight stupid shit that doesn't make sense n there will always be someone to blame so I guess now is millennials
You searched: Are Millennials Killing the U.S. Housing Market?

Did you mean?: Is the U.S. Housing Market Killing Millennials?

Is that jack antanoff?
I think boomers are the ones to blame for how shitty the economy is. And they were the ones to raise millennials so...
I don't think millennials are entirely to blame. Some of the things mentioned were already in decline, whether it was because it was simply outdated, perspectives changed, or societal changes. There are plenty of factors. You can't blame everything on one person or generation.
The Housing one isn't our fault some or most want to move out of their parents house the difference is WE CAN'T AFFORD ONE
im a MILLENIAL we fuck all the time
We need to have a chance to see DILF Mark's hot body!
"Who created this article a Eunuch?" 😂😂😂
Got me laughing with grandpa.
I absolutely HATE generational studies.  Every single source you go to for a chart on which generation started at what year/what time period is different; PLUS, EVERYONE in EVERY generation's situation is different, expectations are different, realities are different, and preferences are different.  You can't pinpoint a group of people and speak for all of them.  That's called stereotyping, and that's ALL generations were invented for.  To divide us.
But like millennials b doin most too kinda right?
I’m 20, and in that weird gray area between millennials and generation Z...i dunno where I belong because I don’t relate to those fortnite tiktokers lol.
Wait I don’t get it. What was happenin in the first one? Someone explain please? Much appreciated!
I am 33 years old and according to Pages I've read I'm considered a millennial and in response to these deaths:
SEX: only twice in my life LOL
HOOTER: have hated the food for years
BEER: Nasty!🤢
CHEESE: cheap but hardly ever buy
KIDS: dont want, EVER!
HOTELS: Airbnb & Hostels unless traveling w/others
HOUSE: I want a tiny house
CABLE: Haven't had for years
DIVORCE: Most likely to never marry
VACATION:💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Millennials are ending the world.
I think Millenials have a lot of faults but killing industries is not one of them. That's just how things work when people are poor and they don't care about what you're selling. Also the divorce thing seems silly and is probably partially also because people can't afford to get divorced.
Let's go to Hooters

Hooters I dont know

Johnsons?

Maybe 

Lol
7:33 “You’re only as happy as your saddest child.” Well thanks for making my parents feel like shit.

AirBnB is made by millennials, mostly used by anyone who wants to save money
Do more videos like this!! Having both people there and getting different perspectives and opinions is more interesting
Idk, man. I’m a Gen Z-er, so off the topic, but speaking of beer industry... of course the damn thing is dying. I need something stronger to wash away my misery with. Like vodka, for instance
EH can i get a fuck millennials in the comments
i think cable is dying because of youtube
Okay, but like, as far as vacations go, our employers are the ones killing that because we can’t afford vacations...
5:22 SUBconscious?! Anyone with me?!
Generations simply put people into categories based on their birth years. I don’t understand the generalization around these groups. Times are changing. As time goes on, we evolve as a society with no positive nor negative connotation. We move on no matter if you label it as positive or negative. It’s not one generations fault. We’re all at fault as well as the evolution of our society. The problem is this generational divide that we’ve created and continue to support. Therefore, let’s grow up and get over ourselves.
I dont think it's baby boomers vs millennials. I think its old people hate/ dont understand young people. Its always been that way. Even when the baby boomers were the young people.
None of these things are millennials’ fault. The world is just evolving, as it should.
Lmao, is there a "Johnsons"?
Well when homes cost 200k plus in nice areas for the bare minimum, yeah we arent going to buy them.
Don't worry about the beer industry, or any alcoholic industry.  Us Scotts and the Irish will carry it for you all lol.
Air BNB record your actions. So if you want to sleep at someone's house and watching you naked sure go ahead.
Generational divisions cause problems and often fail to recognize the kids in between generations (as well as the entirety of Gen X). Sincerely, a Gen Zennial.
Wtf
Lol the one thing I look forward to every year is vacation 😂 even though I usually do the same thing every year, go to Orlando
I'm a gen-Z, but i think it's the baby boomers fault for the housing thing.
The oldest millennial is only 37, who do you expect to have 3 kids by than?
Are they killing vacation and all these other stuff that cost money? No. Because we don't have the money and would love to go on vacations and own our own house.
The housing market is killing itself. Whether it's because of their decisions, or banks. I don't need to remind everyone about 2008, do I?
Millennials what does it mean?
really really good epis
“Let’s go to Hooters together” favourite grandpa lol
6:25 oh no im going extinct XD
Generation Snowflake
I'm 19 and I have a problem w millennials sooo
What’s the point of the “still kicking” option? If the answer is no, then it’s still kicking by default
Did these guys seriously say "are millenials killing kids?" The fuck is wrong with them? And also it's a good thing for the world for them to not have more kids anyways. EDIT: Also delaying a child isn't a bad thing at all. Waiting until you're more financially stable is way more responsible. Why tf would the article spin it off as a bad thing.
Netflix is sex lol you dont watch Netflix if you dont want sex
My moms a boomer, my brothers are malinials and my lil sis and i are gen z.... its interesting how different we all are. In some good ways and...... well the bad with my brothers is really big but i think we all just butt heads because we think our way of thinking is better instead of listening... or in my sister and my case not speaking about our opinions.
please react to shiloh dynasty. PLEASE!!!!
Can we have reaction to endgame? From the people who have watched and how they feel.
I like how they don’t even read the articles
Id be good with 4 or 5 kids... eventually

Companies need to adapt their products and services to the needs of their target market, not the other way around. If your company is going bankrupt is because of your incompetence and no one else's
Oh boy, some of these aren't even Boomers or Millennials.
Silent Generation: 1925 to 1945
Baby Boomers: 1946 to 1964
Gen X: 1961 to 1981
Millennials: 1982 to 1995
Gen Z: 1996 to 2008ish
*Dates are a rough estimate and can overlap each other but you get the idea.
Preach, Madison! I graduated from college $35,000 in debt in 2009 and worked three jobs for a while before I could get a job in my field. I'm still paycheck to paycheck, 10 years later. Maybe divorce is dying because nobody can afford it.
Love too see the millennials being represented are very obviously California Democrats. Of course they think they are never the problem
Millenials were the worst generation ever! we generationZ will have to step up the game.
Just because houses are being built, doesn't mean they are being bought. The housing market is falling because its own greed.
California millennials are completely different from other Millennials
With the discussion about beer,you have to think about pricing,we don’t have much money to spend because of rent,gas,and other costs so why would we want to spend a ton of money on good beer when you can buy a bunch of cheap stuff and have money to spare.
Vacation is still kicking. Work a lot for months then take a 1 month vacation.
We need "Teens react to Seven Deadly Sins"
As a middle child oof
why and how 40+ "dried prune" dudes and dudettes ar hotter then millenials?..
man fuck...
I liked this episode
“But we finished it”😂😂😂
hello
actually loved this, it's great to put it out there that Millennials should not be blamed for everything and there are some good coming from these changes. We're just changing our lifestyle and goals.
Shut the fuck up boomer 💥_💥
"Is this with a partner, or without?" XD
im a middle child
Killing off sex? There are multiple pregnant women in my HIGH SCHOOL!!
I think it’s funny that a lot of the “millennials” in this video aren’t even millennials at all lol
I’m 18 with 2 kids and a house I’ll be paying for for 10 years and I have a great job. I’m not a millennial. Just me.
React to the trailer for “When they see us” please
I was born in 1993, does that consider me a millennial?
Yea buy a house when you can't afford it and be in debt until you have gray hair makes a lot of sense
This channel is dying on his own tbh
Have y'all thought about how when we were born we were the youngest human
Every excuse they give for why it's not millennials fault, has a solution. College debt? Get a trade. City living expensive? Move to the country. No money? Stop wasting it on Ray Bans and Starbucks.
Shut the fuck up 

BOOMER
Yeah millennial’s are kind of a bad but it’s not really their fault they’ve never fought in the war or struggled as much as past generations have It’s really because were so well off this day and age I’m 20 by the way
"Are millennials killing the housing market?" If we had a penny for every time a baby boomer said that, then we must just have enough to put down a deposit on a house in the housing market they f**ked.
Heeeyyyyoooooo
POWERTY is killing the economy. Millenials are POOR, bc of greedy rich capitalists.
It's hard to have an interesting "reaction video" when everyone has the same reaction. Not very interesting when there's no confrontation and everyone is politically correct.

Millennials are people who are born between mid 1980s to mid 1990s
Boomers are people who are born between mid 1940s to mid 1960s

Roughly. It doesn’t mean every millennial is this or every boomer is that.

What are millennials and boomers ? I don’t know what’s going on in the video cause I don’t what these are
You know, the world's population has doubled in just a matter of a few decades, and the older generations are all mad at us for realizing this as a problem and wanting to produce less kids. Are we the only ones seeing this? Of course we don't want three kids for every two parents. Yikes! By the time my kids are in school, we'll be at 10 billion for crying out loud! There won't be enough food and resources to go around!
I'm a weird hybrid of millennial and gen x. I worked hard to buy my house but dont want more than one child and other such things

I’m a millennial. Myself and a lot of my friends prefer to drink hard liquor over beer for a variety of reasons. For a handful of my friends, a headache sets in soon after drinking beer, whereas hard liquor doesn’t have that side effect. Personally, I always end up with a hangover when I drink beer, no matter what kind it is or what tactics I try (I always drink water and eat, but I’ve tried switching up the type of food I have or what times I eat - none of it works). But I can have whiskey, vodka, or tequila all night long and be fine. From my personal perspective, that might be one reason beer is falling in popularity. Then again, myself and all the friends I’m talking about prefer to have cannabis than alcohol, so that could be a big reason, too.
Would be nice if all this generational nonsense would end, not sure how anyone still thinks that there's any logical or rational substance to it.

Housing market is dying because it is still rolling out the houses based on on 1950s tech and construction practices largely and using the same materials to built it and keeping the prices rising forever !
The other factor is ...... that this sector is still very human labor intensive and governed by the archive rules and regulations placed just after the WW2 to protect the interests of labors and their trade unions and construction companies while ignoring the end customers in the free and capital driven economy !
Hint !.... : 12% of US population prefers or compelled to live in a motorhome or RV because corporate sector is making huge R and Ds in this motorhome sector rather than the normal housing sectors making and owning it as easy as car ownership plus suffocating rules do not apply like in the usual homes !
Homes are now by and large taken as the retirement scheme or investment plane rather than as a usable commodity !

How are millenials killing sex? Free sex or no strings attached sex is way more common with millenials than with other generations. Millennials are whorish, stereotypically.
And in just a few decades the young ones that think are all that will be the old ones and shit upon by the young ones of that time. Never ending.
To me the millennial debate revolves around older generations being in denial of the fact society doesn't work well in the way they were raised in. Sex is "dying" because consent is now a thing, heavy alcohol consumption is "dying" because we talk about stuff and get therapy, general life choices of adulthood are "dying" because we don't follow a guidebook of life and actually wonder what to do (what creates anxiety and uncertainty and etc) AND cheese is dead because OF COURSE IT IS. Did you ever watch a documentary on eating healthy then saw one of those food hacks where the lady does anything and always sprinkles ten tons of cheese all over everything? Yuck.

We Millennials are just a bunch of killers huh? 🤔
I mean, "are millenials killing the u.s. housing market?" I'll be changing it here to "netherlands" instead of "u.s.", houses are expensive, and i mean... people with regular income usually can't buy a house if they work from when they are 20 till when they are 30-35. Renting a house is more doable, but the waiting lists until you finally get a chance of renting the house nowadays are 5-10 years. Estimatedly because it can take even longer. Having to sign up and pay money every year to a website so that we can rent a house in about 10 years... i mean, yes it's only 10 euro a year, but still... in my opinion it's about the thought that goes into it rather than the money itself. I find it extremely idiotic...
Team millennials! 1985!
So what if companies are dying? Why are they blaming millennials when companies don’t succeed? As a company, in order to be successful, you must adapt to the consumers and what they want. When companies are too lazy to change based on the consumers and blame it on millennials, I think that’s just petty.

2:04 maybe is because they aren’t given parental leave
(3:50) I have a hard time believing that given how big craft brewing is among Millennials.
We are not killing sex we just prefer it online and alone😎.
The main thing about why less people want to have kids and why people are having fewer is because the world is incredibly overpopulated already. With sea levels rising things will only get more and more overcrowded, and resources will become more and more scarce.

I never understand when you invite someone to a vacation and they say no i cant go but they never do anything but work so i know you got vacation time saved up
You could say that the crazy expensive student loans are to blame for a big part of those things and simply information the rest; Millennials have less money and are more concerned with their habits on a long-term view.

I find the articles sensationalised. Yes, millennials changing attitudes maybe a factor but other factors are to blame as well. 

Example: the child one - it’s more expensive to raise children, people on benefits are generally looked down upon, wages are not rising as fast as costs and it’s becoming more acceptable to not have children if you don’t want them among other things.

I can tell you the reasons why many millennials are miserable (and different):
1. Everything is a lot more expensive
2. Overpopulation is a problem
3. School and education gets harder and harder (and more and more inhumane)
4. Increase in stress, anxiety and depression caused by pressure - by expectations in social and mainstream media, among other things
5. Former generations not caring enough about the environment, leaving the younger generations with little to no time to try and fix it for future generations
6. People either being narrow minded and noninclusive of others, or being overly sensitive to a point where it stifles personal growth
At least that's what I'm seeing as a millennial.

The reasons everyone graduates with 100k in debt is because millenials don't understand economics and colleges realized people are so dumb now they'll go in debt, so there's no reason for colleges to keep the costs down if dumb millenials are willing to take on all the burden!! You used to be able to pay your way though college, but again, millenials think socialism and free stuff is awesome. That's why your minimum wage isn't worth crap anymore. You don't understand economics.
Its just the differents in lifestyle and also life is expensive now

We aren’t killing sex, it’s the result of a high statistic falling. People having sex was at an all time high in the past - it’s literally why they’re called baby-boomers because after the war people were thirsty af. It’s the same with marriage there’s a solid reason why ‘divorce rates are skyrocketing’ because women were allowed to divorce in the 70s without having to ‘prove themselves’ and could finally escape destructive relationships.

Old farts need to accept the fact that the world is changing. They've fucked the world so much that now it's the mellennials jobs to fix it. People have different mentalities and that's fine.
Most of these in my opinion and what influences most millennials is essentially the economy and costs that they have to deal with
So as a middle child, am i going to extinct??
I'll say this about vacations. It's not that people are skipping vacations because they are hard workers. They are skipping vacations because they can't afford vacation. A lot of millennials work within the gig economy, where they don't work for one company for 40 hours or more a week. Because of this many don't qualify for benefits so if they want to take a vacation they have to save up for it and make sure they have enough to cover the loss of income for that week or two that they aren't working and the sad truth is a lot of people can't afford to lose 2 weeks worth of income.

I'm  what people  would consider  a millennial  but  I'm  curious  why does media  act like  Gen x doesn't  exist?  I remember  when I  was  kid back in the 90's  they were talked about all the  time but now they're  never mentioned.
I honestly think Cable is still kicking. It really depends on where you live and what channels you want because not every service will have all the same channels. They might have most but not all. Also, not killing vacation. I would like to go on vacation. . but don't get paid enough. Though I get paid "decent" I do love working. I am a hard worker and when I do take "time off" I don't go anywhere because its too expensive. I would like to go to a hotel. I am a hotel person. I like the idea of Air BnB, but don't want to feel like im taking care of someone elses house. Someday (I know there is some companies that do it) but I hope lots of companies in the future make their employees go on legit vacations and pay for it too. Happy Employees, Happy Work. But that's just my take on it.

It's funny how Gen=Xer's are always left out. As the kids of Boomers and parents of Millennials, they have alot of interesting aspects.

Yet, they are seldom mentioned.

No you are not silly more of you have ways to express themselves so the stupid can speak now though internet and most of the time those are the ones who make headlines
I would assume the reason they don't want three children anymore is because it isnt fair on the middle child, it tends to be the youngest and oldest get the most attention and throughout the middle's life they seek attention in bad ways as the gradually become older.
Millennials are just trying to navigate a different world. I'm sure we would love to have our own homes and children but life don't work that way these days.

It's funny how we millenials get blamed for contradictory things. We're both lazy and destroying the economy by not working hard enough AND destroying vacations by working through them and creating too many technological advancements to keep up with. We're both irresponsible and selfish for not taking things into consideration AND overly cautious and selfish about starting families before we're sure we can settle down. We're both wild drunken promiscuous partiers AND the generation killing off the beer industry and sex. I can go on and on. We can't be blamed for both sides of the same coin, you kinda have to pick one. And it's nice to see a video like this where you have boomers and millenials talking about these things together and debunking a lot of these false claims.

"This just seems to me like older people are like unhappy with their lives and they just wanna blame millennials on everything." #TRUTH
A lot of the things these articles don't consider is that Millenials have a lot more access to information and scientific understanding of the world and themselves. They don't have as much sex at a young age because they know it's not safe, they're not having kids because they know how not to and what options exist to stop that shit (and how much it costs), they're not going into housing because they know that they need x, y and z before that, they're not getting divorced (or married) because they've learned the basic laws pertaining to that kind of thing and understand how it can affect their lives. 

Like, people don't understand that all our lives we've been shown examples on tv and other areas of what can go wrong in all kinds of ways, so of course we're taking a step back and rethinking options. The previous generations didn't have internet and the knowledge that we do nowadays to make their own choices, to talk to each other and seek advice off actual professionals easily when something comes up. Of course, there's a big discrepancy between the generations now. We've got access to so much more than we ever had before, so it's going to change how the generations now and in the future act.

We can also "blame" millennials in a lot of areas for more focus on health, cleaner environments and social progress. I think that there is a general pattern where each new generation is more progressive than past generations.  There are obviously regional exceptions and some specific things which regress. But humans continue to socially and psychologically evolve.

I don't mind staying at a hotel. I rarely have issues with them, plus they usually have an indoor pool and hot tub which I love! I've stayed at an AirB&B once, and it was weird to be staying over in someone else's house like a creeper. Their house was clean, tidy, they had a list of Do's and Don't's as well as instructions to how to work the TV, but it was still very weird.

Gotta go for the "stay"-cation! Get a good hotel room with a Jacuzzi bath in the same town you live in. Buy some price-appropriate wine, popcorn, and maybe a pizza. Maybe buy some Epsom salt. You're looking at  an(at max) $250 vacay!

I think in the case of the cheese it's  "dying" because people in general care more about what they eat; and it's more comfortable to have a streaming service than cable.
And in the family/house stuff, I think millennials are more focused in having a professional carrier

Damn. My mom would be miserable if that was true
divorce rates are sky rocketing, what the fuck are these fools on about.
The beer one is too general, I believe Millennials are killing the big named brand beer industry like Budweiser, Bud Light, etc... and shifting over to favour craft beer and IPAs. The big brand name ones aren't adapting to what Millennials actually want so because of that we are shifting over to other brands. Plus with the explosion of micro breweries and local craft beers becoming so popular its easy to see why some people would think its "dying".
Being a 99 child I'm in that weird transition from millenials and gen z I know the 90s stuff but grew up with 2000 Disney too (hannah  Montana, Jonas brothers, big time rush. Kim possible Danny phantom etc.)

Millennials and Boomers? More like BOOBers.
When they are saying "it's a general trend, it's dying on its own" that means that Millennials are killing it. Millennials are who follow or set trends. So if the trend is killing something, thats because Millennials are doing it

The media(not this channel) is killing itself
Millennials are from another planet. They're called Indigo Children.  😊
As a Millennial myself, I definitely believe that a lot of these headlines are simply attention-grabbers.  I liked seeing both the Millennials and the Boomers reacting to each and voicing their opinion of this.  Nearly across the board, certain things that are "dying" are doing so due to changing trends, which just happen to occur during their generation.
Millennials are not the problem... it's the boomers and I'll explain. As an older generation millennial, I just want equality for all. Example: Would it be so hard for Hooters to hire beefy men for equality? If so, Hooters is the problem and not me...
Media: Overpopulation! Oh no! We need to control it!

I think the industry is killing cheese on their own. I have been purchasing shredded cheese as it is convenient, but I notice it doesn’t melt properly if that makes sense. I restarted the nuker because the cheese wasn’t melted on nachos. I blackened/burnt the tortilla chips but not all the cheese melted. Gross!!
I live in California. I can’t fuckin afford a house. Hell. I can’t even afford an apartment. Most of them are $1.5k-$3.5k+. 

I’m a part time student & part time worker while trying to manage my personal life.
Other interesting (to me), observation, millenials are not the children of baby boomers for the most part. They are primarily the children of....you guessed it...gen xers! Boomers would most likely be grandparents of millenials.
Tbh, as a Gen Zer, I don’t get why people crap on Millennials all the time. Since I see Generation Z as basically like if someone took Millennials and Gen Xers, chewed them up together and then spat them out, producing Generation Z, I don’t get it.

Categorizing generations is ridiculous. Who the hell decides the supposed years range? So, just because someone falls within the years range that was arbitrarily decided, they're suppose to relate and be more like someone 15 years older than them as opposed to someone 2 weeks younger just because they happen to be born in December of the last year of that supposed range? It's literally the most asinine thing ever. Separating people by these whack generation assumptions and generalizations is just lazy and self-involved. Every time someone older (whether boomer or Gen X) starts ranting about millennials and Gen Z, this is the literal translation: "I'm old and fearing my mortality and I need to blame someone else for the atrocities and destruction my generation has caused to the economy and the world."

I’m from Gen X and owning a house was out of the question for me when I was growing up because they are priced so damn high, so I could only imagine what it’s like now.

The housing issue is faceted. You can't trust loans anymore, and if you go to college today, you're in debt, possibly for life, when you leave.


Cable can screw off. I've got a Roku. Everyone needs to get a Roku. I've got Netflix, my choice of any other paid service, and a ton of free ones. Pay $100 monthly for cable when you can watch the Roku cable app for free, or watch any one of a few thousand free movies on demand? Piss off.


The baby thing is faceted as well. First, like a house, they are really expensive. Plus, it's just not justifiable in our overpopulated world, especially when global warming is closing in on us all. I don't want to bring a kid into this world, knowing his future's going to look less like Pleasantville, and more like Mad Max.
It’s simple previous generations hate on the next for no actual reason
Elders react Naruto please!
The thing about 'Millennials killing 'middle children'' is that it actually has nothing to do with Millennials. If you look at the data when it comes to a country's development level, as they become more developed and education, healthcare, and body autonomy becomes more readily available to the women of that country, you start to notice that population growth starts to decrease. At the moment, if it weren't for immigration, the population of countries like Norway and Sweden are actually in decline because people just aren't having enough children to keep the population up. China too, has had a noticeable drop in population growth within the last 15 years, that the country has actually made a database of 'breed ready' women (make of that what you will).

I feel like everyone was lowkey not blaming millennials throughout the entire video, but in reality they are causing lower rates of these things. Some of the things lowering are good, like beer, Hooters, and divorce, but like in other areas saying millennials are the problem is wrong. The price to live in any urban and even suburban area is so high that it causes millenials to have to live with their parents -Gen Z here

The thing about the marriage thing is that most millenials dont see a relationship they would rather be friends with someone and have benefits so basically they are a couple but the lady doesnt want to be recognized a couple and also milenials are a lot more choosey when it comes to marriage because they fall in a category of how the perfect mate should be

Millenials are also killing Off-White.
I'd like to hear a discussion longer than a 10-20 second vote if I am being honest. I think recognizing some of the changes that we're slowly making can help us understand why there are also new problems showing up with these new changes.. Both small and large. There are more to it than blaming or denying headlines.
You should do Gen z
I've noticed a lot of boomers get divorced because they got married and then they moved together. You never really know a person until you live with them.
"you're only as happy as your saddest child" if that's in any way true then my parents must be severely depressed
WHAT DOES STILL KICKING MEAN
I don't think millenials are killing any of these things. It's just the natural progression/dying off of things, plus the economy is shit right now and that affects when/if you can buy a house, when you can pay off student loans, how many kids you can afford, etc. Plus, I think millenials don't feel pressured to get married and have kids like previous generations were. So millenials can take more time to find someone who really matches them rather than getting married to someone because of societal expectations. Therefore they're also older when they're having kids, so they don't have as many.
I don't know why but the Madison girl gets on my nerves 😂!

The beer one is dumb.  Beer consumption is still high... just people are realizing that large mainstream brands are nasty and craft beer is the way to go.  Tastier.
I don't believe in generations it is just to divide and confuse society we are still the same we all went to kids and teenagers and to adults regardless of technology or events.

Industries dying is not the result of a generation. Just look at blockbuster. Netflix took over because with time and the improvement of technology, physical DVDs are in low demand because it’s more convenient to watch movies on our phone. If an industry doesn’t transform itself to better fit the world of today, it’s going to die. Also, boomers are the ones who made the economy the way it is today, which is why millennials can’t afford housing, children, etc. How tf you gonna blame millennials when the system was set up by boomers?

Economic injustice is killing this stuff. Millennials have one thing going for them that I didn't. They know these things are either wrong (social things), or virtually out of reach economically. This is a reality for my sons, the same reality I had. The difference, I was sold the lie that upward mobility was still a thing.
The boomers were the last generation with the ability to have things in an affordable way. It is what it is. It needs to change.

You people need to stop! Stop using Millennial as a blanket term for young person.

The Youngest Millennials today are 25 years old this year. All these people are Gen Z. You are making my generation look bad by comparing us to these 19 year olds.

The smallest bit of research goes a long way to making you guys not look like idiots. Seriously, ignorance isn't an excuse.

For the TV thing, kids have too much homework and stuff, we don’t have time to sit down and watch 1hr of TV straight, so why do people think Millennials  are killing Cable!
They’re right. We’re killing the middle child. One smart decision at a time
As one generation becomes the industry leader, the old usually becomes obsolete and new industry more suited for the current generation's interest rises. Repeat. It's only natural society evolves and changes, thus "killing" the old in order to
 birth "new".
Old gen always gotta hate on new gen.





I already hate the new generation
I hate how simple nice values has gone down the drain. Now it's all about sex and not love and family values

All the new technology was made by the previous generation..

 Smartphones were made by them, prices are set by them, economic status are set by them,... Millennials are living with these changes.. They were the cause and are upset with the effect of changes on millennials??? Adults created the changes! We're just living as the changes happen!
"My generation was the best because of (insert narrow misinformed opinion that ignores facts and reality)" - every generation
I think the media is trying to tell a story of millennial and baby boomer conflict when it doesn't exist on any large scale (at least in W.E.I.R.D. countries). I think there was a recent study about how millennials look up to, love, and are friends with baby boomers, and that it's negatively impacted out development because it's made us less independent and more complacent.
😔
It’s not necessarily a bad thing that people aren’t drinking as much. Do you want people to be addicted?
This is so stupid
If the milenials are killing all this then wait till my generation comes
For the beer one.. I'm in middle school and some fellow gen z students are having beer now.. sooo
Okay, boomer
Every new generation will be somewhat hated and looked down on by the previous generations. As people get older, they become comfortable with the way the world works. When new ideas of how it should work or the appreciation for traditions start to die out in favor of something new and more relevant, older generations fear the changes. That's just a natural reaction to someone stirring up what they've grown accustomed to. But not recognizing this and blindly condemning new generations for their differences does nothing but make older generations look out of touch and create unnecessary conflict. Always be willing to think about the reasons for changes and why they might be happening rather than assuming the world will end as a result. Don't know why this is so hard for people to get.

I'm millennial and I love Hooters!
Keto is killing alcohol and sugar.  Good riddance.
I blame millennials for the Hooters things because of how most of them are so fucking sensitive they are and they probably protested against a women choosing over what to do with her body. Conclusion? Millenials are forcing people to do stuff while trying to make things equal, let them decide what to do on there own, don't decide for a girl who wanted the job, anyway this is probably scuffed because it's on a phone and I have ADHD and got distracted. Bye bye

It used to be that business would try and figure out what people want and give it to them. Now, they try to tell people what they want and force them to buy it. Housing is the perfect example. Absolutely everything shows that people want smaller homes, yet developers are still trying  to force huge homes and luxury apartments off on people. They are like the person in the relationship that just can't accept that it is over. Big business is stalking us.
Like being a millennial myself, I think just some of the things we do and say are a bit... corny.

Can you do something with the generation x


(who"s a gen x)
Millenials are not killing beer. We may be killing the Budweiser s of the world because we prefer craft beers. If anything, there's just more competition and we tend to like variety. Like I love buying/trying a new beer every weekend and stock up on my favs but yeah.
First and foremost, millennials are killing freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Facts. Where are those on this list?
Some of these topics I think it's too early to call. Millennials are doing a lot of things later in life that previous generations. Im interested to see in a decade how many millennials own houses and have middle children, and if it will be more comparable to other generations.
I have no idea what generation I belong in. So many sources use different years. I was born in 1997, so am I Gen Z or a Millennial?
Millenials killing off vacation, housing market, etc. FUUU if we were given better pay and housing market isn't shooting for the moon we'd be able to save for a house before we retire AND go on vacation =.=
I like how not having a lot of kids is considered a bad thing, even though like 100 years ago there were like 2 billion people and the boomers and gen X are the ones who had a lot of children and raised the population

You guys should really do one on millennials who truly believe they are not millennials. Or something like that. Because man I was born in 85 I know I am a millennial but there are so many who do not believe it lol
gen z is the best generation if u dont agree youre wrong
Millennials are from 1981 - 1996. Madison, Ethan and Jeannie were born in 95' so they are Millennials. Also a generation last at least 20 years so 1996 would be too early to end the Millennial generation. 1981 + 20 years is 2001. So the millennial generation would've ended in 2001. Every time I search "Millennial generation" it always says that the millennial generation ended in the early 2000s.

The beer one I don't agree with. I feel like millennials are helping grow the craft brew local beer businesses and drinking less traditional beers like budwiser and coors. Building craft beer is a good thing.
Millennials are killing the housing market? Lol buying a house is so expensive that millennials can’t afford to buy one
Madison’s a smart one with personality

concerning the divorce bit: a lot of millennials are products of divorce, and we dont want to subject our own kids to it so we take the commitment more seriously. older generations were taught to get married as soon as possible, but we have experienced first hand that its not a good idea to jump into it so quickly.
I want 3 kids lol that just seems like a nice number to me, not too little and not too many.

"Millennials are killing walking."
Everyone has a different version of a generation. Those born in 1996-2002 went through the technological events and relate more to each other than other years.
Millennials are so entitled. I don’t think anybody can argue with that.
I think every generation gets a bad rep growing up. I’m gen x the so called “slackers”, boomers were “lazy” and millennials are thought of as “entitled”. Personally I like that millennials wait to have kids, it’s smart to know who you are first. Marry or not marry is your choice. Believe me it’s easy to get married and, a pain in the ass to get divorced.
When you're a Gen Z dude and you're just like, ok...
I'm trying to start a band called Millennial Murder Machine. All songs will be about stuff we're killing.
Millennials are killing sexuality and sense of reality ...
times are just changing. it's not only the Millenials faults. and future generations will likely continue these trends. sex is definitely not dying but earlier relationships may be since Millenials are waiting longer to get married, if they even chose to, and definitely don't have or are realizing with finances that less than 3 kids are fine. trends change and these are the current trends.
The only time i ever watch tv now is for my spanish soap operas "novelas" or the weather/news
A lot of these are very dumb, they blame without understanding that with this economy, no money= no house, no vacations, can’t afford kids. Millennials are just more aware of the choices given to us since our parents and society shoved their past issues down our throats 💀💀

I don’t think it’s just millennials are killing things I think it’s just people in general
Most of these are an economy thing because you have to consider how many of these things cost money especially when we get out of school how much debt we have and the cost of everything raising compared to how much debt we have and how much money we make

WE NEED GENERATIONS TO REACT TO STRAY KIDS PLS
Millennials unfortunately got stuck during a time when prices are on the rise and the cost of living has reach an all time high. So for us to be able to have the same life style as the baby boomers we proportionately have to make more to have less.

We are in a time when sharing has become common in order to save money. If you look at who raises the prices and who forces millennials to think twice about our spendings it’s the baby boomers or generation X. From Gas, to housing, to education millennials have to pay but it’s the previous generation making the profit.

This is just an opinion I’m not knocking down any generation as everyone works hard to have a fruitful and happy life.
I don't even know what millenials are, but I still watched it anyway lol

I love pink and her facial expressions
You just gotta love P!nk!!! ❤
I love Pink she’s amazing. Got her album Hurts 2B Human please react to it. Please react to Avril Lavigne Head Above Water album. Lyme disease awareness.
she's amazing! omg please do one with Lady Gaga
She is the only pop artist that I love seriously she is the best
P!nk is my role model... seriously... amazing singer, amazing mom and human being
I'm not much of a "pop music" fan, but Pink is one of the artists in the genre I can always appreciate, and it's mostly because I feel like she's the genuine article in an industry of fakes who just want to make as much cash as quickly as possible. She's successful because she's real, as well as being funny, honest, flawed, complicated, original, and immensely talented. It's great seeing her on Internet shows like this, I hope she does this more. 

Any chance she'll meet up with Rhett and Link sometime? :)
P!nk needs to get no doubt back together... hey baby
What a great whole model, i always looked up to her, still do
❤💙💚💛💜
Pink is the best her she can be and love her genuineness
I’m 49 and I love the meaning behind Pinks songs, who ever instilled her moxie did a great job.
I wish I had the confidence  and power that P!nk  has. I'm not strong like she is. God Bless you P!nk you will always be my hero. I love you!
The kids should react to foo fighters
Pink helped my little sister through her terminal illnesses, she had the chance to speak to pink at the age of 6 as a part of her make a wish, Sadly Mickayla passed away 16/03/2019 at aged 15 due to complications with pulmonary hypertension, Pink is an absolutely amazing woman if there is any way that this message goes to pink I'd be forever greatful on behalf of Mickayla's family we want to thank her for making Mickayla smile and be able to tackle her health issues head on ❤️, her whole funeral we had pink's songs playing ❤️
I love you Pink! I was raised with you and you are the only person I listen to with my mom all the time! I was born to your song “I’m coming Out”
She's beautiful not just her looks also her personality as well
She's amazingly amazing :)
She is just so real. Her amazing music aside, she just seems like such a genuine and kind human being. Such a beautiful soul. ♥️
"I make those faces." Mood
Pink is awesome! Can you do this with more celebrities? Like a WWE addition?
FANTASTIC JACKET!!! ❤❤
I love pink i always have been such a huge fan :) Her personality is awesome
I love her❤️
Shes so amazing
I love how pink loves kids and treats everyone equal. I have loved pink sense she first came out. Awesome singer and performer
Love you P!nk so much. You are so talented yet down to earth,  kind and bold at the same time & your voice.... it has healing power. I can listen to your songs for hour and hour on repeat and still craving for more.  Love you.
Love you P!nk 
Your music helped me through my child hood and even now that I'm a grown up
I love pink and I am going to her concert
She is amazing! I love her voice and all her songs. I would straight away recognize her voice whenever she sings. So humble and real. Love her attitude! 😃❤
That Calvin story....my heart...my heart..is full of love again.
Ugggh, is there even a better human out there?? 😍😍
One of the best human beings out there. Love you P!nk!!
shes a queen
My best friends and I grew up on her. She was our childhood!
I love that she hasn't botoxed the fuck out of herself like other singers of the same era. She's beautiful just the way she is
I love her!!!
Absolutely love pink
You guys should make elders react to the 1975
Pink is amazing. She's a superhero to a lot of people. Keep on being you, you deserve the very best.
P!NK IS DOPE!
P!NK is wearing her headphones upside down :)

I love you your my idol😍 I wish I could go to one of your concerts! but your show in Dublin sold out in minutes 😢 maybe one day I will see you live x
LMAO @ "Voodoo doughnuts  made a cake out of me and I didn't get it?!  That's f** b****!"
Everyone else who "can't" draw: I cAn'T eVeN dRaW a StIcK fIgUrE (I get that too many times.)


Pink: I can't even draw a frog on a skateboard. (That's much more creative!)
The part with Calvin made me so happy.
Every musician wears headphones like that
Everyone needs to wear headphones like that.
love pink! she is so great! XD
I saw her as my first concert!! She was so amazing!!!!
Pink can't wait to see you in Cardiff!!! 😁
Can't believe you've used my little boy 2:09mins in.. I was in total shock 😁😍
I wanna be u pink
I went to her concert in early April and I was literally crying seeing her. Nest time she comes I will pay the money to see her closer and if I could I would meet her.
Oh wow Vancouver. I don’t think that was the show I went to but if it was I can’t believe I don’t remember it.
Please react to Ateez you won't regret
the world is so much greater bc of pink. my little sister loves you so much, shes 19 now and has loved for since she was old enough to know what music was. last summer i took her to go see you for the first time and it was incredible. we are going again this weekend and i personally am stoked. you cherish the fans so much and stand up for what you believe in, so much more than many artist do now-a-days. love you p!nk. <3
Have katy Perry come on the show
I want tomorrow by together here....😂❣️❣️ i need more kpop artist here
The little boy at 2mins in is my grandson Billie, he loves singing
P!NK is awesome I hope that someday I can be like her.
omg I LOVE P!nk wtf
Whats wrong with men?
Pink aged🤣
Wow,these people get to meet a LOT of famous people :p
Pink is a phenomenal individual - cannot recall a time when I didn't like this fine artist - right from the 'I'm not dead' album - listening to that particular CD, you get to experience her full range - the bluesy sound she evokes is outstanding. This woman will be around for many years to come - thankfully :D
I love P!nk’s music; she was one of my inspirations growing up. 💖 Bless 💕
Who else wore their headphones like her for this video?
YASSSSSSS THIS IS THE BEST. OMG IM SHOOOOOK
P!nk is the best!
Oh no, her album came out on my birthday as well as that terrible Taylor Swift song. :-(
She’s really irritating. Those headphones would have fit fine over her hair.
I've always loved P!nk!! since day one. amazing voice. beautiful inside and out.
I love pink so much! so rad that ya'll had her on here and she took the time to shoot this <3
i loved how she wore her headphones
=) CoMe HeRe
Omg I love Pink she is so sweet😍
OMG I’m just watching this now, and I’m so happy you were able to film with P!nk! She is one of my biggest inspirations and she’s the most honest people out there! I saw her in concert back on April 19, 2018, and she put on one of the best concerts I’ve ever seen! She is one of my Top 5 people I want to meet, and I want to tell her how great she is and how her music has been a part of me every day! Again FBE, THANK YOU for having her on your channel!
P!nk is legit my favourite celebrity. She is such a total badass in so many ways and she such a knock out, beautiful woman. I am in awe of how cool she is.
PLEASE DO WESTLIFE!!
8:26 is my mums friend picture heather is such a good drawer

Love P!nk 💖
I really do appreciate & respect P!nk and love her music.
Pink is such a queen.
oh my goodness she’s gorgeous. i love her & her music so incredibly much
Pink really is one of the best people and this just makes me love her so much more.
Pinks 2nd album, Missundaztood got me through the first couple years of highschool. I will always have a place in my heart for this lovely soul.
What a great person ❤️❤️❤️ like if you got a better impression than you thought you would get out of her ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"I make those faces, that's great" lmbo. Pink realizing her weirdness.  Me too.
She’s so down to earth! So badass
I'm a bigger fan of Pink now.
My favorite Pink songs; What About Us, Who Knew, So What, and Just Give Me A Reason.
Do They Know It, 90s Country Music.
I love her so much.
Pink is beyond great.
Omg P¡nk I love you xx
Pink songs are my guilty pleasures as a metal/rock listener. But she's really a great character and I'm glad she exists.
Love her ❤️
This is why I will forever love Pink!
Female empowerment is a joke LOL
Ur song just give me a reason is so important to me bc my uncle and his friend sang that song. So that song reminds me of him

Isn't she the one that called us Mexicans toilet cleaners.
Posted on my birthday ! Love you pink! 💕
P!nk is litterally the best artist!
People are real with P!nk because P!nk is real with us. She doesn't sugar coat life, marriage, motherhood, anything. She talks real talk. She sings about important issues. She refuses to just do what everyone else is doing, or following trends. She makes trends. She lays her soul out there for ppl to either accept or not and doesn't tolerate the bs. THAT is why people adore Alecia and why she is a legend.
P!nk is just the best. The best. No doubt.
PLEASE REACT TO PRETTYMUCH
Omg I love u so much P!nk if I was to meet u in person I would be korny burst cry lol

Love her so much, so many of her songs make me bawl my eyes out. My husband and I went to see her last year, BEST SHOW EVER,  I was a few weeks pregnant- talk about youngest fan! Lol
I don't really like her music, but I really admire people like her who won't let fame change them in a negative way, there's a lot of famous people who don't deserve their position at all but she totally deserves it
I frigging love Pink :D
I FUCKING LOVE PINK AND SHE IS AMAZING❤️❤️❤️ If you guys could do it with BTS I would love it.

I’m so happy you invited her for that caus she’s so precious and always making me smile by her kindness
Well I just lost it when it came to Calvin. Tears are f-lowin....
I just love and adore, Pink! Ever since I was a little kid. I first heard Pink when she had a new music video air on MTV, and my sister was fangirling so hard over her and stopped what she was doing to watch the music video. That was nearly 20 years ago. And I've only grown to love and respect her more and more as every year passes, even with how her music style has changed and adapted into what it is today. I related to so many of her songs back then, and still do today. And she has such an amazing, badass, compassionate, and loving personality and is just so real. She's one of the few artists who is just amazing live, especially with all the acrobatics and aerial stunts she does while singing perfectly. I'm not one who considers going to concerts as fun; there are only a handful of artists I would go to a concert for and Pink is most definitely one of them.
I freaking love pink
Why am I not in that studio ?
I ♡ Pink Soooo much
"did she shave he-...i wanna smack her" 😂😭
She so dope. Got her album few days back but haven't heard it yet. Was saving to savour it properly but now I havta havta make time soon!
PINK has better hairstyle than most man disdays.. Including me 😬
Pink, please... get more sleep.
I love her so much y’all have no idea I mean look at how she puts on her headphones omg my spirit animal
I love P!nk!!! I'm going to her concert in Glasgow

Fun fact P!nk, she said she wanted to be a poet and the lyrics that girl had tattooed onto her were 2 syllables short of being a Haiku
Pink is by far one of the hottest people in the world.
Find the fans and have them react to her reacting to them.
I love how humble Alecia is!
I love song what about us
Everyone’s talking about how her name is P!NK but look how iconic the way she wears her headphones.
What a badass wearing headphones like that! 💕
Love her
wow I love her
Do a Taylor Swift reaction please
She is SO BRAVE to go in that harness and fly around I went to her concert once (I don’t know if you remember me, but I had pink hair and when you flew, I stood up and you almost touched my hair) and it was AMAZING and she’s the most INSPIRATIONAL woman ever
Is anybody going to her concert tomorrow in north Dakota
What a great person, I love P!nk and how true she is. She shows how vulnerable she can be through music but how badass she is as well.
EVERYBODY FIND CALVIN!
P!nk is one of my favorite humans ever
Best part of being an artist way better then the money
I LOVE THIS
This is the only PINK i like😂
Mariah Carey reaction please! 💜
She is my hero
I love her I have been listening to her music sense I was little!
I love Pink! Would love to see one like this with Gwen Stefani, or one with elders reading Gwen's lyrics

"I make those faces!" 😂😂 I love it!

In my mind i always wanna ses Pink in couple with robbin williams
Pink is so down to earth and such a great role model. I love her so much!
Pink😎😎😎😎
I love pink, such a great personality and awesome music too :)
So I think It'd be mazing to see people react to certain movies. I'd like them to see some of my favorites like my favorite clay-mation movie is Mary and Max. My favorite Musical is Dancer in The Dark. Even though the director is creepy, Bjork was golden in that. If you don't cry with that movie, you're simply not human.
Pink can you make a concert for disabled only?!  I really wanna go to see you up close but I’m pretty unwell and it’s too hard.
She will always be my #1 female crush
The best 👑👑👑
I love Pink!
that’s a weird way to wear a headphone🤔
I love pink and she seems like a wonderful person.
"I make those faces.... That's great...." 😂😂😂

Do this with Demi Lovato please
She's so nice and humble...God she's a very amazing person who truly deserves everything she has earned.
OH GOD I LOVE HER 😭
P!NK is best girl💜🖤
Omg! Cn we have @avrillavigne to appear here too? 😍
next time she comes to Mexico I'll be in her concert , Pink! is one of the artist I had followed since the beginning   of her career  ( since misunderstood )  I was a little child when I started liking her music , now I'm 27 I still love her music   and i haven't gone to one of her concerts , unbelivable  X.X
“I can’t even draw a frog on a skateboard”
I love P!nk so much oh my word
“I make those faces...that’s great.”
Lover her 😍
Humilde Humilde Humilde ser humano 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞 Love P!nk 😍😍😍😍 México soon?
When I went to the barbers to cut all my hair off ( it was down to the bottom of my back) I shown a picture of pink and they did it exactly how she has it now 😂 she’s so amazing!
My first concert was Pink in Limerick Ireland. My mum was crying to her song ‘Dear Mr. President’ I remember kids laughing because my mum was crying, my first time really being proud of my badass mother who isn’t afraid to show emotion!
I love pink. She is amazing and takes time for her fans.  Please react to a frog on a skateboard lol
Yasssss pink
P!nk 👑 😁
Pink: I make those faces. That's great.
Alecia is hands down the BEST performer I've seen in my life. NEVER misses a note, ALWAYS sounds better than her studio recorded voice (CRAZY TALENTED!) . She deserves MORE success and fame
P!nk is the absolute best.  So underrated, She deserves all the awards.
The best concert ever.... 3 times. Waiting for the 4th one. ❤️

i'M SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS. p!nk is amazing. She got me through my parents divorce and the loss of good friends I've had over the years and now I listen to her music and cry when I think about my son and how he is just fucking perfect.
How the heck did you get the legendary Pink on the react channel
my last concert i saw with my aunt was pink and nsync thank you pink for a wonderful night, she died 6 months later
I can't even explain in words how lucky I am of being a fan of her goddammit.
I love Pink so much. She's one of the few people I really look up to an admire. And it's like she said, it's because she's unapologetically herself and I think that's something we can learn from and something to admire. I've considered her one of my role models and I've never regretted that. Thank you to fbe for having her on the show.
let's react to AJR!!!!

8:46 Haha, she says that but she also once did tattoo of a frog on a skateboard on an Aussie DJ/TV personality called Hamish Blake.

The DJ is named Hamish Blake... not the Frog in the tattoo... :)
I grew up with P!nk! I was in middle school when I started to listen her music. When I was 16 my uncle took me to her concert that was in Zagreb, Croatia so I get to see her live and it was amazing! 
And I’m 29 now and still have her songs on my playlist. 
I remember I got her first album on a cassette! Her songs shaped me into becoming a strong and independent woman.
How did you get her omg-

At this point.
Ignoring guy rights like this is sexist. So, kinda counterproductive. I know they don't mean it, but it is actually sexist because people seem to forget sexism is for equality. So to not ask or even acknowledge there's some things guys have equal rights on. Is also sexist. :T

Yep, she's kinda sexist.
Love her🍍👌

wooow how did you get pink?? :o she really is a world star, so inspiring and i believe very true to herself and what she believes in.  (even i am not the biggeeeeeest fan of her music), but she really is a role model and strong woman.
When Pink said there are walks of every life at her concerts she was 100% telling the truth. My dad who is in his 50’s loves Pink and even went to one of her concerts. Shoot my dad has been saying recently to me and my mom “I’m just waiting for those Pink tickets y’all bought me.” He’s gonna be disappointed when he finds out we didn’t get the tickets now.
I LOOOVE HER <3 <3

I've loved Pink since 1999 when I saw her on the MTV's Spring Break rocking her pink hair and camo pants. I was 12 years old
Wow I Love Pink :)
she is rad
P!nk: I can’t even draw a frog on a skateboard 

Me: 😂 I’m so done 

P!nk: there’s so much bulls*** in this world that it’s refreshing when you see a like minded soul

Me: You are clearly Not alone with that, why can’t we be friends??? Seriously people!
She is the best
I just knew when this girl broke through long ago her star would always shine bright. Being humble is such a great quality to have as a person and she exemplifies this perfectly.
Pink is a beautiful person.
P!nk told me that it is totally okay to be myself 💗

It's impossible not to love her. Noooo way 💘
She's so genuine and so accessible to her fans, that's why her fans love her the way that they do. She's not one of those snotty pretentious celebrities that constantly want to stay above their fans. Pink doing these things on youtube makes her "touchable".
Pink is so fucking awesome. She deserves all the respect and power she wants. Girl Power
She is so gorgeous
I love pink

u guys need to react to hurts 2b human!!!!
The real queen of pop!!! 
I get why people love Beyoncé and feel like she’s the top of the pop game, but there’s a lack of pretension and an honesty and openness about pink that’s sooooo much more relatable and heartwarming. 
We’ve seen her grow up and she’s been so open and honest about herself from the very beginning. You can’t help but respect that!! She’s an inspiration.
I love her creative way of putting on the headphones lmao
I love Pink so ridiculously much💕
She’s so genuine and wholesome!
OMG P!NK. Yasss my favourite singer. I love her new album. New fav song 90 days. I went to her truth about love tour. But I was right at the back 🙁

If Pink sees the comments:

I loved your rendition of the U.S. National Anthem during Super Bowl LII, and was even more impressed to learn that you did so while getting over a cold.  Thank you.  

The only other singer I feel still holds the best rendition though is Whitney Houston during Super Bowl XXV.  Incredible voice.
Pink  I love you :3

Omg,omg,omg omg!!!!!
I like how most people say "I can't even draw a stick figure!" but P!nk says "I can't even draw a frog on a skateboard."🤣
I love that she said she does care what people thinks. It's like she said, it takes guts to be brave and follow your dreams, and she has major guts for sure.
Pink is so close to her fans, I've never seen an artist interact that much with the audience. A lot of hugs, jokes, she loves having individual conversations with random fans in front of 20 000 people lol
I love her!
Shes one of my favorite artists bc of her story, she went through so much shit since so young, she is humble and has empathy for others. Also of course her music is fucking awesome since the beginning and while she grows, so does her music. Glad for her health, her family and her art 🙏
P!nk is pure.
Hi

Honestly, to put your headphones on like that, especially as a musician, because of your hair is one of the most conceited things I've ever seen. Does this not bother anyone else?

This was so nice! I wish you can do this with more celebs like Ariana, Nicki, Katy, etc. This was dope
Can you do with Taylor Swift?
one of the most underrated artistes of my generation.#artists that matter
UGH!!!! Pink is Amazing!!!
Pink's one of those rare stories of people who grew up in very negative circumstances, and almost let fame and her inner demons destroy her. But instead of allowing that to happen, she decided to break the cycle of hurt in her family, and teach herself how to embrace self care and self improvement. She's a poster child for a reformed bad child who still has the best parts of her rebellious spirit but no longer needs to self sabotage. If only more celebrities were self aware and embraced and self reflection.
I cannot love her enough.
Can you do Harry Styles!!!!
Pink is the most badass woman alive & yet so humble and sweet to her fans. So many celebrities could learn so much from her.
Any small YouTubers wanna help each other out?
WoW... That’s the level!!!
omg i love her jacket and i need one now
I have always loved P!NK, her music and lyrics have meant so much to me. I have followed her whole career. I have every album, DVDs of her concerts.

Can we please do this same video but with Demi Lovato or Shawn Mendes!?
aussies remember back in 09 when she did hundreds of shows for months like half a year because back then Australia was her biggest fan base before she became more respected and popular! Ever since I was 9 I have loved pink and I remember my mum and I were upset we couldn’t afford to go to the show back in 09. But last year we were finally able to go and it was the best thing ever! It was also so emotional and I can't explain it for words how amazing it was!!!
Talking about female empowerment isn't grown up, it's immensely childish.
You never catch a little boy singing about boy empowerment is all I'm saying
She’s just the best. Her mind and her kindness are so in tune with my soul. Also, I feel hella left out of those art and drawing posts you’ve shown. I’ve done a billion drawings of her.
So um am I the only one who sees a swastika In the background design?????!
Everyone pls go buy/stream her new album 'Hurts 2B Human' 🎶
Pink, thank you for reacting to my fan moment with you! I’m so glad you like the empowerment message of my new song #BecauseImAGirl. It would mean the world to me if you could watch the Because I’m A Girl music video:

https://youtu.be/w50JY9ks78I 

You inspired this. You’re my idol and I love you sooooooooo much!! 💖💖
I just love how her reactions to art are a mixture of impressed and "oh God I look like that!"

I love P!nk so damn much. When I was a kid I lived with my grandparents and dad. When I was with my grandparents, dad was working, we weren’t allowed to listen to anything but Christian. But when I was with my dad he had several cds we loved to listen to. And misunderstood was one of them. I listened the shit out of it. It made me feel I wasn’t as alone as I felt there. 
Thank you P!nk for the insiration and love you give.

P!nk is the best! ❤
I remember a few years ago in highschool for my performing arts class we all had to make presentations and I was the only one left in the class doing singing so I made mine on the most iconic artists and bands in the past century, one per each decade. And for present day I chose P!nk and I had a video on that slide from one of her live performances and my teacher ended up making us watch youtube videos of her performances for the rest of the lesson
I truly adore Pink for her confidence and her caring persona.

What headphones are being used in the video?
Honestly I love P!nk so much, she's so down to earth, funny, and not to mention extremely talented, definitely one of, if not the, the best popular musicians out there.  I'm Not Dead will always be one of my favourite albums of all time.
I want to thank you and you mean the world to this rock singer

OH MY GOSH, she has been my favourite artist for like, 10 years, and have been watching this channel for couple of years, never thought I would be seeing this video 😍😍
Anyone else notice that her headphones were backwards
Pink, you're one of the strong and powerful people that maintains a very strong sense of compassion and I can't express how much I appreciate pointing young'uns your way as an inspiration.
Just, Thank you!

I'm not a fan of pop music but after Madonna and this lady, that music died, the new ones like taylor swift, Cyrus, Ariana, Bts and all of that is just a huge pile of crap. So if you really like pop, this girl is one of the best ever.

Come on Taylor...after the "Ready For It?" video, I hoped you would chose a more badass path. I know the video's visuals are nice, and Brendon Urie and stuff...but the song is so bland, generic and boring.

I was never a fan of Taylor swift but this colab ooooooooooooooooooh
Can't stand Taylor Swift. The only good parts are when Brandon Urie is singing. I'm just not a fan of much poppy stuff. But I've never liked Taylor.
I'm so sick of people still saying they like old Taylor music and the new stuff are "boring" or "bad". Don't they get tired of repeating the same thing every time? We get it. You hate change!

26th April is my birthday. It has been more contaminated by this terrible song than by the fact the Chernobyl disaster happened on that date.
What a soporific song.
Her... Taylor Swift... She just changed her Vibe... Like...
'Look what you made me do, look what you made me do, look what you just made me do, look what you just made me do'
And now in 2019 we have:

*WARNING*  much information about Panic! ahead.


You might know this, but Panic! has a music video trilogy. (Say Amen, This is Gospel, and Emperor's New Clothes.) Basically, it's Brendon dying (Say Amen), getting treated in a morgue (This is Gospel), and going into hell (Emperor's New Clothes). The main thing that causes all this is the Devil's Key which is in Brendon's possession in Say Amen. It's also featured in the music video for King of the Clouds. If you translate the hieroglyphs in King of the Clouds, it might* spell out ECENGOTVHECENGOTVHETLOWDC
. If you split those letters into words, you get this:

Ecen  Gotv  He  Cen  Gotv  Het  Low  Dc 

Which might translate to:

Walks

Austrian News Station 

He

Prices

Austrian News Station

The 

Low

District of Columbia



The opening of the music video for Say Amen is a news station. And it sounds to be Austrian. What if 'he' means the devil (and the 'low') and 'prices' is Brendon's soul. I'm not sure what the District of Columbia would be, but whatever. 
In the song 'The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage', a line in the song is: It seems the artists these days are not who you think
, so we'll pick back up on that on another page. 

That song was released in 2005. 



Don't even get me STARTED on the music video for LA Devotee. That video is just plain creepy.



And there is a lot more where that came from.


 I did a little more research, and the hieroglyphs in King of the Clouds are supposed to spell out 'King of the Clouds'. Maybe it's just a coincidence that the translation I got said that, but I'm still skeptical.

(the reason i wrote might in the first paragraph was because it might translate to something else if the hieroglyphs mean another letter.)


I love P!ATD with my whole heart, but what does everything here mean? I'm trying to 'crack the code' about Panic. Reply to this if you've noticed anything else, or if you want to give any feedback.

when two good voices team up with Panic!'s production budget...
This is seriously not a mash up I would've ever expected, yet as a Panic! fan you learn to expect the unexpected. It's not a bad song, it's not something I would willingly listen to while sober, but it's not exactly bad either. I like the visuals in the video even though they become a little bit overwhelming... but most of all I like how much fun they seemed to have while shooting the video, especially the moments where you just see Brendon running from left to right being all hyper and such. Made me think: yup, oddities unite!
I love Taylor Swift and Brendon Urie but I can't stand this song. I agree with the girl that said it's too poppy.
none of these conspiracies that led up to this can ever COMPARE to that of twenty one pilots. i have no words to describe how detailed and thought out those ones are.
I love how people are like: Oh and Brendon is in it so It’s better
Hmmm I only listened to it because of Brendon!
Generation reacts to Devil's Work
OKAY SO GUYS. I HAVE A THEORY. I think this era is going to be a combination and a little mix and match of all her previous albums. Her shadow in the beginning looks like her picture from the Speak now album cover, she had the snake from the reputation era, she had the phone from 'our song' (Debut album) and finally at the end, she was dancing in her best dress fearless.
When ur mum was right about it being a stage

This is like the “Focus” of Taylor Swift’s career.

I haven’t watched yet, but I’m making a prediction that they aren’t going to be talking about Beebo in this.

Edit: so, I’m not gonna finish it, but they said his name twice in the first five minutes. And Taylor’s considerable more. Sigh.

This song is probably the best song of 2019 so far.

My favorite part was the intro where Taylor was like, I AM CALM!!!! It always makes me laugh

I love Taylor Swift ❤️❤️❤️1️⃣3️⃣
This is trash
Honestly only listened to this song cuz of Brendon and I won’t listen to it and i don’t particularly enjoy this song but I can really appreciate Taylor’s talent and music even tho it’s not what pleases my ears.
So a song about who she actually is as a person, how she treats guys, and this is very cool? Taylor has become a satire of herself.. How anyone can take her seriously anymore is just ridiculous..  How she is able to keep this guy shes with now as a boyfriend has to be more about PR than actual love.  The woman knows nothing about love, nothing about how relationships work, and she wants to teach young girls that this kind of reprehensible behavior is acceptable.. Where have we gone as a society?
REACT TO BTS THEORIES!!!
So, someone is actually grew up with Taylor Swift... okay.
This is fuckin garbage
They should react to BTS theories🙄😒
I legit only listened to this song when it came out because Brendon Urie 😂

react to stray kids
All the hints and clues.   Wait till they hear about twenty one pilots
^taylor and brendon said in their live in insta that the song was meant to be happy, and it shouldn't be taken seriously. That's why they put "spelling is fun!" part, they wanted it to be just a fun happy song. And knowing taylor, her lead singles are usually like that, something that the general public will eat. It hypes up the whole album. The same she did with her previous albums, we are never ever getting back together, shake it off, look what you made me now, and now, Me! All of these songs don't, and i cannot stress this enough, DONT reflect the album. The lead singles were meant to just go viral or something, so that it can sell, and get people to start talking. 

And to the Sinners who got mad for this collab, just look at Brendon's latest livestream. He's so happy working with Taylor with this song. Taylor too picked Brendon because Bren has that energy for that poppy sound of the music. So don't go blaming anyone that you hated the collab. They're both fans of each other for a long time. Let's just be happy for the both of them because clearly, they are! :) 

And I don't even like the song. Still I respect the both of them and see their intentions with Me!

If Brendon Urie ever proposed to me I would've said yes
I don't get why people keep saying OMG SUCH AN UNEXPECTED COLLAB bc seriously, Brendon's work is getting more and more pop sounding as time goes by, we all knew the day of making songs with pop stars was coming. The only reason why I wouldn't imagine this collab is the fact that their voices don't work that well together in my opinion - her voice almost disappears when they sing together lol
All the media thing and stuff they made up is good but damn they could have hire a better french teacher for their clip. Their talking in french was awful, had to listen to it 3 times to figure out what they said (I'm french).
Love the song, the people in the video, the video...just everything about it

Hey guys! How're you doing! I've covered this song in piano acoustic arrangement! Please share a second for a view <3 love  https://youtu.be/RSPslXboe0M
Yeah Taylor Swift is BEAUTIUFL
I have heard that this album was supposed to be the next album after 1989 but because of all the other drama and the first single of rep being "look what you made me do"
This song reminds me of nine in the afternoon so much
“Come to New York”??????? It’s the intention that counts my god
I think Taylor's been watching Shane Dawson
I love Brendon SOOOO much ugh
Brendon Urie and the message in this song are the only reasons I will listen to it.
HOW CAN YOU DO A BRENDON URIE SONG WITHOUT ADAM?????????????
I wonder if the reactors go out and like tell everyone what they’ll be reacting to like kids do after they go into someone’s office or something lol
4:07 “She’s wearing country boots can she go back to her country roots” 😂😂😂😂
honestly besides the fact the brendon is in it, this is an amazing bop
I LOVE YOU TAYLOR ❤️❤️❤️
fans will ALWAYS make conspiracies and most of the time they are disappointed bc they were just coincidences but the fact that Taylor really gave the fans real hints is so cool
you should have generations react to City Girls Act Up
React to if I can’t have you Shawn Mendes!!!!
Anything with Brendon Urie in it? I press like

Have them react to the twenty one pilots lure and their cryptic things and how they have teased their album  that was released in 2018 all the way from 2009
You should react to Shawn Mendes new song
I just now realised that Aiko looks so much like Camila Mendes
I love Taylor, but this songs just soooo generic so I get why people aren’t liking it. “Spelling is fun” wtf 💀
But usually her lead singles of her albums don’t sound like the rest of the album, hopefully that’s the case with this one too...
React to Shawn Mendes - If i can't have you
I like Brendon Urie but not Taylor Swift I hate this song and I'm kind disappointed in Brendon I hate the  outfits obviously Taylor's fashion choice

You know, what really bugs me about many of the reaction videos recently? It's that most of the reactors have already seen the video at least once, so we don't get to see their genuine 1st reaction.
Don't get me wrong, I like the different personalities on React and hearing their opinions is fine and all, but seeing them react for the first time, forming and expressing their opinion in front of the camera, seeing that process happeninh, that's what I'm most interested in, that's why I love watching react videos. And to that effect, this video gives me almost nothing.
oh she’s wearing country boots can she go back to her country roots damn
My reaction to this video was it’s awesome but then I was like wait ummm is Sara ok with this
i'm SO here for people NOT hating on taylor
0:00 SO TRUE
I wasn't sure about this but I am going to watch it with ya fbe But love thy Brandon Urie...Britt, I agree I do perfer her in the country roots.

I am hardcore panic fan and Taylor is like ok it’s just this is sooooo poppy and that bridge makes me wanna die it’s so dumb
Also as a non swiftie (don’t come for me) this wasn’t super hyped it just kind of came from nowhere and I didnt know what was gonna happen. I was just hoping that the lyrics were going to have a little more substance than what it had but I don’t know maybe I’m crazy
Gavin is such a Swiftie i love it.

All of Taylor's music is narcissistic shit, but the worst thing about 
whenever she comes out with a new song (which she just did months ago)
 is suddenly the radio stations become the "All Taylor All the Time" 
stations and play her shitty new songs *non-stop for weeks and months 
afterwards!*

React to eva.stories on instagram
Kpop has been doing this for a long time now for their comebacks so I wasn't that surprised when Taylor did it 😂(bts, exo, loona, shinee, etc)
In look what look what you made me do it was quite ferice and this song is sweet and bubbly! Which i like! Not saying that Look what you made me do is a bad song i just prefer this song!!!
No one:
 Brendon n Taylor: arguing in french
React to If I Can’t Have You by Shawn Mendes pleaseee
2:27 me
I just have a feeling Taylor is secretly watching all of these videos fangirling over her fans :D
react to the new shawn mendes song if i can’t have you!!!!
so bad
Roses are red🌹 
Violets are blue😝
If ya’ll are swifties😘😍
👇 Make this blue💙
YAY
3:28 "i wanna marry his voice" lmao😂
I'd rather shit in my hands and clap then hear this fucking song again.
I agree it’s too popy I only watched it because of Brendon Urie js 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
YES. YES. YEE YEE JUICE
REFRESH NOT REPLAYYYY
Taylor and Brendon’s friendship is everything I ever needed
terrible song, void, no content whatsoever, made only to sell. so not like Brendon, I was shook.
I see people complaining on how this isn’t panic’s style or he should change the name and such but I think they’re wrong. If someone truly loved and respects the artist they will gladly try and adapt to them, Taylor is doing what she wants and it makes her happy. Brendon is doin that as well, he’s making a comeback after all that happened to the band and now he’s solo! People complain a lot about this but people grow up and we have to deal with it, I for one am going to love Brendon’s music for the rest of his career because he has an amazing voice.
This collab took my early music tastes (Taylor) and brought in my favorite artist like ever and I love it, like, I didn't think I would like it, but dAMN. Also this was a fantastic birthday gift(the video dropped on my birthday)
Meh.. I mean not my cup of tea. Brendon on the other hand needs to drop the Panic name because it’s not Panic anymore. I’m 27, and I’ve been a fan of Panic since I was 13. This ain’t panic. It’s hot garbage pop shit, that makes me sad.
“She’s wearing country boots, can’t she goes back to her country roots?”
-exactly.
I mean i freaking lost it at the girl with the reference to country boots and country roots
When Taylor went on her 1989 tour i went, when she went on her reputation tour i went, if she goes on tour for this album im obviously going!!!!!!
I don't know if I'm alone in this, but I listen to music for the actual music...
S p e l l i n g  i s  f u n
I don’t know why everyone hates Taytay but I love her so much and her music. And this song is my new fav from Taytay.
I can't believe in 2019 people still want her to go back to country. I liked her country music too, but there are so many other female country pop artists that are good. Taylor is doing what is best for her, and it's obviously working
I think it's really fun for the fans, i think it's FANtastic ;)
The girl in the music video at 3:21 is actually me when I saw Brendon Urie on the cover of the music video 😂😂😂😂😂🤠😂👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Tbh this song was naturally a good song it's refreshing to hear something positive once in a while. I get that it may not be everyone's tea but there's really no reason to be so negative about the song.
To every P!ATD:
This is not normal. Normal things with Brendon are:
He,killing people in his house
He,becomes a demon
He,in his funeral
He,killing miss jackson
Not a rainbow and a mary poppins umbrella...
I loved it this song. Reqlly enjoying relaxing positif.
People are hate in this song because Brennen is married
They probably just looked back at the song and then planned to release it on the day.
I think “look what you made me do” was just something to get OVER her pst and this song is to change into something better.
4:09 Can't she just do whatever she wants with her music?😊
I love Gavin lmao
Lol..how they reacted is how i react to new bts MVs
4:08 IDK Brittany can she??
”Shes wearing country boots, can you go back to your country roots?” 
 Best quote ever
I wonder what their reaction would be if they knew about the theories of Bangtan Universe...
Who loves this song?






Me-eeeee-eeeeeeeee~
I love Taylor swift i watch this video everyday who else does lol 😂 ❤️
Taylor is Queen❤
FBE... You should pick reactors that hasn't seen the video yet, otherwise it's not a react video anymore.😢
Brittany and I definitely share a very similar opinion about Taylor Swift lol
brendon urie and no adam? well...
Great video
not a fan of Taylor but i love Brendon
1:07 LMAO
Can you have them react to Shawn Mendes’ “If I Can’t Have You” please?
3:39 I like this person





😂😍😊❤️
Can they please react to ,,If i can’t have you’’ by Shawn Mendes?
You BELONG WITH MEEEEEE! YOU BELONG WITH MEEE!

It’s a LOVE STORY BABY JUST SAY YESSSS!!

Edit: EASTER EGGS ARE EVERYWHERE!! I KNOW MOST OF THEM :D
it's a nice song. sure, it's not her best work (i'm still stuck in the red era!) but it's nice to hear an upbeat and happy song once in a while. not everything has to be serious and dark and edgy so it's great to be able to enjoy a catchy song like ME!
4:06 Jesus are you actually kidding Me Like I'm sorry but do you really hate Poppy songs that Much???
She’s wearing country boots...can she go back to her country roots.
10:52 NO LADY, TAYLOR LIKED THAT POST!!! Nothing in the swiftie fandom is ever a coincidence
Basic song 👎👎👎👎👎👎
Owemhuii
Taylor is the new Einstein
SWIFTIES here. 💟❤💛💙💜 TAYLOR SWIFT ONLY
can you react to 'if i can't have you' by shawn mendes, that song is amazing!
React to lil peep
Can you do a teens react to Shawn Mendes new song “If I Can’t Have You” ❤️👍🏻
Please let generations react to two of us !! Music video ( the bucket list video)
For Gavin, I hope you read this. I think that you're a boyfriend material that every swifties needed. You're one in thousands, dude. All the love ❤❤🦋🦋
Please do Adults or Elders react to Two Of Us (Richards Bucket List) by Louis Tomlinson
i think Taylor has high IQ
See brendon, click. Hear brendon, freak. Meet brendon, fleek.
BRENDON
I love this song. I'm like Me~ e~e~ee.
Plus Brendon Urie in it! I'm a fan.
Taylor Swift is a genuis! All her clues are really cool!
FANCY TWICE PLEASE !!!
“Taylor Swift fans really go all out”




Clearly this girl has not met the members of the skeleton clique
Love all the clues, Taylor is the new da Vinci
Taylor is a genius for planning all of these and swifties are literally detectives :D #GoSwifties
do react to shawn mendes if i can't have you
Also... Is Brendon going "solo"? Is he going to make his name more famous?
Can you guys please do “people react to Björk”???
React to BTS Performance at Billboard Music Award.
i'm not really into poppy and bright songs like me! but i love it because of their voices and how unexpectedly well they work together <3
My mind is blown 😩🎉🎉 seriously Taylor is too good at what she does
It's really nice
11:25 I thought he said “her fans are slutes”
React to twice fancy
Brendon coming to the ground via umbrella aged well
I'm kinda shocked with Brittany's reaction to this when she's is just as poppy and upbeat as the video. Unexpected, but I respect her opinions. Loved everyone else's opinions though!! Taylor's all about constant transformation now, so I'm giving her another chance and loving her new stuff 💖
why are everyone being so negative? stop theorizing stuff because it’s just a basic song. i wouldn’t call it the best taylor song because the lyrics were kinda cheesy & stuff but it’s not horrible—so horrible that everyone have to hate and say tHis sOnG iS TraSh...
The next song is LOVER  IT SAID IN THE SONG AND ON HER POST IT SAID LOVER!!!! It goes “baby doll when it comes to a LOVER”
ME! Is my fav songs right now! Im so glad you guys did this vid!
Videos like this don't work if they have already seen the video in question
Wow I didn't know Brendon Urie's fans are so toxic and immature. Most of them are grown ass adults so far ☺️ Oh well.
But my question is... 
HOW DOES FBE STILL UPLOAD VIDEOS LIKE THESE WITH ARTICLE 13
This is how people look like when they treat this video like endgame.... 🤡🤡🤡
Want to know a better collab a collab that will shake the world





Panic at the disco and paramore that will shake my world
I have learned.. shouldn't come to this channel expecting actual reactions XD half the time all the people are like "oh i've seen this already" like.. people.. if you are on a reaction channel.. AVOID WATCHING STUFF UNTIL IT'S BEING RECORDED
"She wearing country boots, can she go back to her country roots"

Girl...just...why?
This song was so lit and so visual!!! It was like candy to eyes and to ears.
how did they not melt at Brendon Urie speaking French ummmm hello??
Can I have like half her money, she doesn’t need it all, right?
The only reason I like this song is because Brendon Urie is in it
So that's why "the story of us" have been all over my recommendations😂💕
“It’s to poppy” well I mean that’s What Taylor does, POP MUSIC 🙄
came for brendon, stayed for the cute girl with the white floral shirt and the shoulder length hair
Is it wrong if I don't even know who this Brendon guy is?
All the edgy teen girls in the comments screaming about how they only watched the video for Brendon and how much they hate Taylor 😂 reminds me of when I was 13 and going through my emo phase!
Taylor nation is the official fan club lol it’s her official team
All of you are saying “I cAmE fOr BrEnDaN” we all know you low key cAmE for Taylor too 😂
“It’s too poppy”

It’s a pop song...

Go figure...
Y’all where was the video talking about the fbi investigation that the twenty one pilots clique did 😂😂
Who is the girl in the white top with short hair?? She’s so cute 😭
Please do a Songpop 2 challenge
PLEASE REACT TO IF I CANT HAVE YOUUUU
please react to “if i can’t have you” by shawn mendes
Please react to "If I can't have you" by Shawn Mendes next!😍😍💖
“I wanna marry his voice” girl why wouldn’t u marry all of him he’s gorgeous 👁👄👁
You should do generations react to billboard performances
REACT TO SHAWN MENDES IF I CANT HAVE YOU
Taylor loves giving her fans Easter Eggs - and she loves her numerology. <3
August is on there too, the music video is 243 seconds long, the 243 day of the year is August 31st, and Whats 13 backwards....
This is a selfish song about indulging in yourself and not to try to better yourself. Horrible message to young people. She's basically saying, "Yes, just accept me! I know I treat you like trash but you'll never find anyone like me, so you should be thankful that you know me because there's no one like ME!!!". I mean, really? But because she's in a cute little video, people think this is such a positive song lol
I love that Taylor adopted the kitten that was in her music video.
lol no shade to the swifties or whatever, but if they think THEY have crazy and complex theories, they should look at the waterparks fandom. we base whole theories off of posts for years ago about green sunglasses sksbsksv
A TAYLOR SWIFT VIDEO WITHOUT FAFA KOSTAS NOWAY
where the fuck is fafa kostas
So wait...  You did a Taylor Swift reaction without Eric?
"i wanna marry his voice"
freaking biggest mood ever
Anyone else notice that there’s a Christmas tree in the apartment even though this is clearly set in spring?! Maybe this is a reference to the December single because as the calendar said there’s a stamp on December 13th, Christmas is on the 25th, could she be hinting to a Christmas single?!?
Edit: also there’s 12 days between the stamp and Christmas Day and there was 13 days in between the stamp and ME! Maybe she did that because of the 12 days of Christmas ?!
I only came for Brendon Urie
Please react to fancy by twice. I will keep asking forever because the song is great.
The song could be the best song ever created and people will still find something wrong with it because it’s Taylor Swift.
am i the only one who doesn’t like this song?
3:28 lol
same girl same @ 4:50
i dont get it why people hate this song
jordan is such a big mood at 3:53
I wish they put in the tweet “reputation proceeds ME”
No hate on Taylor but her voice sounds low for the song, kinda take away the poppy mood
I’ve been waiting for this episode!
I have to say I only like the song cause Brendon Urie was in it... whoops
Wow Brittany...
I think that the story of us time and the release date of me is kinda of a coincidence....  I believe before the speech she saw that the story of us time and was like imma release me! On 4/26.... so she gave that hint in that speech.. there is no way she thought about this whole song release in 2010
Im someone who typically doesn’t listen to really pop-like and happy sounding music, but GODDAMN I LOVE THIS COLLAB SO MUCH!!
Gonna be honest I hate the lyrics
I came for Brendon and just brendon
Wow that girl is so moody and negative jeez but i get it’s her opinion but jeez
It sounds like that song “Next to Me”
i was gonna watch it just to see what happened but once they announced brendon was gonna be in it i literally freaked out oh my god
Him: “i'm so not her demographic“


2mins later


Him: @ 


He clearly enjoys it xD
Era theory: kaleidoscope

KALEIDOSCOPE EYES SMILE AT THE WORLD, MY EMERALD CITY DOWNTOWN GIRL... sorry...
YESSS BRENDONNNNNNNNNNNN
Icónico
Her first singles are always kind of controversial though...
Look what you made me do - Shake it off - We are never getting back together, and now ME!
This song is absolute trash
They hate because there jealous 
But we swifties will just shake it off
Haters gonna hate
the best part about me! is brendon
me me big boi
BRENDON MI AMOR. ♥
Jim's just like "No, no...no..."
2:22 good movie
meh
T-Swizzle is losing fans fast, and she can thank selling her soul for it! Her artist integrity is shot! She needs to return to Country pop if she is going to hold on to the O.G Swifties. Many of us feel the same way.
My generation would cry over Brendon Urie. Now they are crying over Taylor Swift
"how far into the rabbit hole do you go?" to far. wayyy too far
I freaking knew they were going to do this.
Director:how many actors do you want
Taylor:Yes!
Taylor Swift fans really figure it all out, have you ever heard of the Clique?!? 😂😂
"I do not care for this song. Its too poppy!" As she's wearing bright green nail polish. Lol
Ima be real why do generations reacts? U should do people who are fans and not fans
i’m sorry everyone, n i really do love you taylor, but this song is bad
half these people already watched it, you should do one with people who are unfamiliar to it
the story of us was a coincidence guys don't be stupid 😂
The story of us came out 7 years before ME! But weird coincidence
EWWWEE
Honestly Brendon is what made the song easier to like for me and I'm not even a huge fan of his lol
i did a cover of this song!
taylor swift songs are getting worse and worse every time, i don't how she continues to be succesful and goes viral
Can you make a reaction for Two of Us by Louis Tomlinson
Aiko my new swiftie queen
YESSSSSS!
all the swifties and love from this video is amazing
I love the positivity in this video
People who “hate” on Taylor Swift thinking that makes them egdy, you’re not egdy, you’re not impressing anyone. NOT EVEN CLOSE.
The best
ALSO the story of us is 4:28 long on the cd version so she LITERALLY CHANGED IT to 4:26 for this
Is It bad that the song reminds me of Camp Rock? ........
LOVE Brendon's voice though.
ok I love P!ATD and I was still very confusion
The cameo Todrick hall made was for me 🤪🤪
Is just another pop song, talking about love like any other pop song. Nothing new, nothing original. But people will jerk off to it because is Taylor.
Girl if someone makes fun of you cuz u love Taylor show me them and tell them to run
React to AJR neotheater
Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift need to make a song
REACT TO AJR PLEASE
When my step sisters favorite singer (Taylor Swift)  and my favorite singer (Brendon Urie) did a collab, we both freaked out! It’s amazing!
“She’s wearing country boots”. “Can you go back to your country roots”. PREACH
Nothing is a coincidence when it comes to Taylor!! Loved her since the beginning, she's so real and her music is always so relatable.
I wish they would’ve talked more about brendon. I mean, it’s his song too.. he is why i clicked on this video tbh.
Brandon urie FROM P!ATD?? You mean IS      P!ATD
It sorts gives me a wizard of Oz vibe actually
I totally relate to the girl who said she wants to marry beebo's voice. Gosh I love Brendon! Needed this collab so glad it happened 😍
TAYLOR SWIFT IS TOO MUCH I LOVE HER SO MUCHHHH
Did anyone else catch that by announcing the countdown on April 13th, releasing it on the 26th means she released it 13 days later??
I actually hate this song tbh
SHE IS SO GENIUS!
HER TEAM ARE BEST!
HER FANS ARE BEST!
i didnt like this song oof
okay maybe locals snapped
Sounds like a song for a kids movie
Lol my teacher told me about this
I only watched it because I love Brendon. Wouldn't have clicked the video if it want for Brendon
This was a waste of Brendon Urie's talents. Haw about a react with him? Guaranteed views. Lol.
Brendon made this even better 👌
I LOVE this song and relate to it so much atm!
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS YESSSSS SKDKDKDH 💖💖💖💖
honestly i’m even more confused
Any true swiftie will love any music she releases
Generations React to Billboard Award!
Why are Taylor Swift fans such master theorists?! it’s like “all right team, Jeffrey go get us some coffee, Tiffany go count those rainbows, and Samantha analyze all the numbers Taylor has ever mentioned ever”! like seriously, these people should work for the FBI
“ And there a lot cool chicks out there!”
Am I the only one who hates this song
I hate that song, idk why I'm an 80s person
"She know's she bad". Taylor is literally the opposite of bad. This music video was literally a disney movie.
How can no one like this song wth lol
Fans really could take over CIA and FBI's job
People were here 28 seconds ago-
One of my favorite songs right now 😍😍
All my friends hate Taylor Swift, but I don’t even care because she’s great and I love her!!
She’d be fucked if she didn’t have a song that was under 31 seconds past the minute
Why is nobody saying anything about my poor Breadbin???
Lmao can they react to all the cryptic theories with Twenty One Pilots
“Look what you made me do was dark and scary”? Fuck me you need to get into metal
“ oh... get it girl, better get it. THATS ME  ! ” 😂😂😂😂 best part of this reaction
It’s a shame she doesn’t put as much effort into her lyrics as she does into those fucking conspiracy things I don’t care about
some of these people are sour 🤭
To panic! fans this song is like a vises and pretty odd mix. What is it to Taylor fans?
Brendon! At The Swiftsco
4:08 oooooohhhhh shade 😂
"This is like the collab, that I needed that I didn't know that I need"

K, why is that so freaking relatable?
I LIKE THAT GUY HE'S A SWIFTIE
finally us Swifties are getting the FBI recognition we deserve
I am honestly not a fan of either of them. They have some good songs but this song is amazing
Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco is weird ...
I think the album is called Lovers
This song is so weird..I don't get it 🤔
A video where no one is hating on Taylor, we’ve come a long way
we stan Taylor and Brendon omg
Rt if you stan Brendon in a pastel suit
my birthday was on 4/26. ye
Am I the only one who thinks this song was meant for kids?
Taylor literally spells out a word
I like the little dance Brendon did at 3:09💛
Great vid
I know it’s not just me that thinks this sounds like it’s made for a movie right?......
3:29 I wanna marry his everything 😘
0:34 it looks like the snake is saying that
We really not gonna pretend this is a good song right?
I wish people could react to bighit entertainment universe theories for BTS videos.
I don’t think any other artist could have pulled this off like Brendon did. This song isn’t meant to be taken completely seriously. Love how catchy the song is , love love love brendon !
React to lil peep
Can we just acknowledge how freaking amazing Brendan is and how much he makes this song?? 👌🏻
Taylor and Swifties are amazing.
I didn't expected that Brendon can collab with her. Brendon wasn't expected to sing such a 'poppy' song.
you should've talked about DEMA and all the stuff around the TRENCH album, that was totally incredible
JE SUIS CALMEEEEE
ME HE HEEEEEE!

Michael is that you?!
I mean the song is like any other pop song
OMG YES
Have adults react to Max Martin and how many songs he has wrote
REACT TO KPOP BAND SEVENTEEN!!
I love Brendon Urie 3000.
Only came for beebo
My birthday was on April 26.....best birthday ever!🎂
Taylor Swift will always be a pleasure. I don't care if the world watches ME like this music, it's really positive and uplifting. The music industry needs it.
Avengers endgame was on April 26...
Taylor parts  belong to Disney Channel wth
I LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT ❤❤❤❤#SwiftSquad#TaylorRocks#ThisIsMyFavouriteSong
Only here for Brendon Urie don’t even like Taylor
If started with tøp and dema they would never finish...
"how far does this rabbit hole go?" you have no idea sdksk
@ the girl in the white shirt whose friends tease her for liking taylor swift: be happy my dude don't let anyone make you feel bad for liking the things that make you happy!
Where are my sinners at?
Why in the hell are people subscribed to this? 18mil? After the shit they pulled a few years ago?

I guess catering to the lowest common denominator of people can really pay off.
this song, in my opinion, is total trash. it’s like every other poppy pop music. if it wasn’t for Brendon i could wipe my ass with it.
I only watched cuz of Brendon and I don’t even like the song.
How much did Taylor pay you for this commercial FBE
Can you please do teens react to Charlie puth 💙💙I love him so much 💙
Please react to more Taylor!!!!!!!!!!!
The rabbithole goes SO much deeper....😂😂😂😂
Cryptic planning is her love language
No way that one woman already belongs to the elders
❤️🐍🦋🌸
all they say is taylor swift








WHAT ABOUT BRENDON UGHHHHH
But Brendon Urie
I think it got a lot of views cause of brendon
4:08 Yes, she should do that immediately
Everyone’s giving Taylor all the praise, Beebo did just as much!
After watching a reaction with a song does anyone else go back and what I the real thing because I do 😂
This is an awesome song! I love it!😍I love it! I love it!🔥🔥❤I am listening to this since I saw it... On loop!😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍❤👍❤😍
This comment section is so toxic unlike Taylor's ME! 😘
I Love this! People not everything has to be deeply poetic. Yeah its cheesy but that's why i love it.. Just feel the happiness people!
taylor literally hides so many hints just for her fans. shes taylurking us all of the time #taylurking
the world in the song video reminds me of We Happy Few
Adults React to The Gazette (J-Rock)!
Even Brendon can't make her sound good. Honestly hate this.
But did brendon urie hype it up ??
I love Taylor swift more than anything and I don't care what people think. I also love ME!
Please React To DIMASH KUDAIBERGEN PLEASE..
People wasting their time to watch a video about an artist they don't even like is so beyond me 🤣 You guys must be really bored
One of my favorite reactions ever! Luv this
Sees Taylor Swift dropped a new track... oh hello..... See Brendon Urie... SCREAMS!
REACT TO LOONA
It’s so cute and light and happy I love it
Nickleback > Taylor Swift


Change my mind.
People are so stupid to listen that shit!!!!!!
😧🔫
This is such an egoistic song. Jeez
The girl that said can she go back to her country roots? Me: no she can’t because she did not get a Grammy for Red her last country album ,so she decided to bring us the pop tay
If you still hating on Taylor Swift, it’s 2019 go away, please.
April 26


Avengers endgame
i love taylor swift thats why i made a lyric video  of her song.
Spelling is fun? What is this? The theme song to a new tv programme for children?
13 July my b day
I wanna say try HYYH series 😌
swifties need to come together to solve the zodiac murder case or something they could literally solve it in like 5 hours
I heard this song on the radio and I have to say, I’m in love. I am a huge Panic at the Disco fan. Both Taylor and Brendon are very talented.
Teens react to the Merrelltwins
React to If I can't Have You from Shawn Mendes!!
I thought everyone hated this... what
I hate absolutely everything about this song, even the video, it’s so dumb, doesn’t make sense. Definitely like you have a pop song a bunch of extacy and then published it. I was so sadly disappointed because I listened and watched it for brendon and he sings so well but the song ruins it completely, I kinda just feel like he’s sunk to a low level. 

All y’all can have ur opinions and that’s mine
I don’t usually listen to Taylor Swift but I actually like this song and video, but if it wasn’t for Brendon I would probably not listen to it:3
Parents react to nle choppa
I am aware of the mixed opinions people have on this song. I am a Swiftie and I know this isnt her best song (i still support her and love her omg). but all our fandom ever asks for is respect towards us, Taylor and the music she makes. :))
can you react to the vamps
They should tell the people to not listen to the song until the reaction vid
some of them are over it by their facial expression. like me too 😂😩
It lived up to the hype cuz Brendan Urie
I am waiting for a collab with Brendon Urie and Shawn Mendes 🤣😍🤗
Eva's Story!!!!
3:31!!! Spelling is fun??? What the heck, this song is the worst!!
The video is great!





The song is not.
I can't help but notice those five-year-old kindergarten boys who thinks it's a trend to hate Taylor Swift.
Ugg!!! I HATE hate Taylor!!
i still prefer the old taylor
Gavin?? Who's that chick ???
ugh i hate it!
If you are surpriced for her clues, you should react to the TRENCH world of TØP, if you understand it haha
i'm only watching this for Brendon Urie. I do not like Taylor swift at all.
React to Marianas Trench. Each album is a different concept so it has a different sound.
Can the old Taylor come to the phone right now?
Yes. Yes, she can.
React to Blink 182
Brendon deserves better
I wish I was old enough and Brandon wasn't married
React to “Eva story”
3:28 I wanna marry him 😂
“She’s wearing country boots. Can’t she go back to her country roots?” Dang rhyme game u got there

Omg never thought i would get this many likes. But first u must sub the acct!!!
Plz do teens react to Joana Cedia
I personally think Brendon Urie was the only good thing about this music  video.
Do youtubers or instagramer react to #eva_stories on instagram

React to GOT7
I love how she keep switching up things she does. I feel like everyone's just waiting for another 1989 tour era, but its not coming back. PERIOD.
pop Queen
I used to love her, and she’s still a good singer but I prefer her Country music, this song is to pop ish
React to 2019 Billboard award performances!
I love this song , it’s just fun and so different from what she’s done !
Ay no... trash .basura
But it's not good tho
I can't be the only one thinking how twenty one pilots has a similar idea of going really in depth with planning their albums and the story.  FBE should have some of the people like Adam who really love twenty one pilots react.
Beebo rocking it with Taylor is the cutest thing❤️
This song is trash honestly
React to legacies
Man, why can’t they have generations react to Set it Off.
I thought thank u next was overrated trash holy shit this takes it to the next level
Gavin is adorable!!
I’m a really big panic! At the disco fan so I was really excited about this song because I thought it was going to be edgy and poprock, something more like “I knew you were trouble” or like “look what you made do”, but I was so disappointed. This is the most pop shit I’ve ever heard, I feel like Taylor didn’t take into consideration Brendon’s style at all.
AIKO! ILY thanks for supporting our queeen!!
I love how FBE put the non haters of taylor swift
Shoutoutshoutout plssss
Tyler the creator
Beebo and Tay Tay
I don’t vibe wt this song. Sorry guys.
I love watching locals quaking
I love the girl with the white blouse
This is a shit song don’t deny
Why dont i ever find boy swifties???? Like, WHERE ARE YOU HIDING!!!!????
I absolutely love the way Taylor interacts with her fans
3:26 she's probably one of those people that goes into Brendon's twitch stream and says she wants to lick his forehead lmao
React dragging the crazy stans, weee-
I am not even reading the words I am familiar with this complement 😂

its not her best single but nevertheless its still a fun up beat song
there’s some good swiftie representation in this video tbh
“Get it gurl....ooh she bout to get it....THATS ME!!!” Is literally the best thing I’ve seen all day
I don’t understand why people didn’t like this song, to me it’s so perfect , upbeat and happy .
Could you react to French music? (« Balance ton quoi », « Rêves Bizarres », « Désaccordé » for example)

It's so positive and upbeat and idk it just makes me SO happy!!!! I literally have nothing bad to say about this song or the video. Brendon and Taylor sound SO good together!!💛💛 this era is going to be next level amazing!😊💛💛💛
Unpopular opinion: brendon carried the song
This was like a school rhyme.
Horrible song.  I love brenden.... but not this.  Never been a swift fan. This song should be on kids bop 2019
i respect Taylor because she has good influence :)

HER MIND!
The age demographic for this song should be 4-6 max.
11:29 is that a pun that no one got? Or am I just overthinking it
Honestly, this song sounds like a song from the Trolls soundtrack.
Queen taylor and Brendon the king 🔥 they’re killing it!
Ps. Real swifties are gonna know every single clue from these :)
I’ve been a fan of Taylor since Speak Now came out, so about 9 years, which for me was 8th grade. She’s been such an inspiration to me.

This song has made me a fan of P!ATD. I knew a couple of their songs, but I didn’t really listen o them specifically. That changed because of this.
React to trench by twenty one pilots

love both Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie too
Taylor Swift's best reactions at the 2019 BBMA -> https://ckk.ai/TaylorSwiftBBMA2019
Taylor Swift is so smart and i love that so much 😻❤❤❤
I dont understand why people like the song, i guess i have a different taste 🤷
hi i love taylor so freaking much
I hate that Jim dummy
lmao and yall still aren't reacting to fancy ?
11:31 FAN-tastic lmao.
ok but i agree with the "spelling is fun" bit but like apparently she added it because "she didn't want it to be taken as a serious love song" and she does change it for live shows a source revealed that it may change from city to city when she goes on tour, and the first glimpse of this was her bbma performance where she said "VEGAS is fun" instead
Can you please react to 
Aadat Instrumental by nescafe
I haven’t really listen to any of Taylor swifts songs since 2016 but I really like this collaboration. It’s more of her old style which I love!! Plus it’s it’s really colourful and positive!! ❤️
This is the reaction i need!
Do they get paid for ... this?
This is historical. You didn't cut any part of the video
College Kids React to Reise Against, please?
Lmao my birthday was on the 26 of April so I was talking to my friends and they know I’m a shifty and a sinner so they started screaming at me too watch it XD
The song was released when avengers endgame got in theaters. ITS TWISE AS A GOOD DAY
3:40 when u sing while putting ur headphones on , and u're thinking that u're really doing good
And Brittany was like, "Can't she just go back to her country music roots?" Girl, humans and animals evolve the same as with music. A singer needs to step up to stay in the game. I don't know what happened to your brain though. Old swiftie music is classic, but you gotta appreciate what she's doing right now.
People are so pressed about Taylor like chill ya'll
The modern fairy tale soundtrack ❤️❤️❤️
BRENDON IS 🔥
Please react to Billie Eilish's new album songs
Y’all think Taylor fans are going all in and figure things out and being detectives. But have y’all seen the hiatus for Twenty One Pilots?

And he deserve this !even if he is not very alternative rock music.....
To be honest, I like the song because I feel like its a good break from all the negativity that has happened in the world recently. I know it obviously can't make up for it but it's a song that makes people happy and some people really need that in their life right now
teens react to the Dolan Twins
let’s all just be honest here, the song is bad.

2:50 Girl, I don't think anybody is hating on this song...
It's not fun when they've all seen it. We don't get their proper reactions then...
I love that they all already watched it
Try not to get distracted
Lol those who keeps on saying go back to your roots are the same people who'd frown once she release a country music then say that she's making the same music again and again.
Spelling is fun



My English teacher smiled
If you are a real swiftie you should've support her whatever style she is.
The snake scared me
I will always find it funny the same people that have the loudest opinion on Taylor's transition to pop are the same ones that have never really listened to her albums in full.  There is a reason 1989 won album of the year at the grammys. That was because it was amazing and yet you tell her to go back to country music?
React to the Marina's new album!!!
"I do not care for the song, it's too poppy." Ummm, shit well . That's the point she was trying to make with the lyrics and video so she kinda sold it? Like the snake reputation era. She made millions of being called a snake and sold merch with the name. Only an icon lol.🦋🦋💖🦋🦋
HER BRAIN .OH MY FUCKING GOD SHE IS A GENIUS. I LOVE HER AAAAA 🖤🖤🖤🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
Omg yes, I waited for this reaction video!!!!!💜💜💜💜

Y'all I mean Taylor is criptic and shit but HAVE YOU SEEN TWENTY ONE PILOTS OH MY GOD...
She' wearing country boots why can't she go back to her roots 😍😍😍😍 like that line!
I'm with Brittney on this one, I don't care for the song.. It's far too poppy for me.
TAYLOR AT THE DISCO!
If they are that BLOWN over basic song teasers, wait until they find out about the theories surrounding the BTS universe
How is none of them melting over how hot brendon is 😍😍
https://youtu.be/bKmYiKKSdM8
She is going back to her crappy kiddie pop songs because her last album flopped.  It's all about the money and has nothing to do with evolving like a real artist.
Taylor Swift is the future legend that dominates into this 2010's decade and changing music forever! She became the icon from Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, and Britney Spears. Taylor Swift is the 2010's musician! I hope she keeps this up in the 2020's! YAY TS!!!
i really love reactions but can u guys get people who haven't reacted to the video yet? idk it just bothers me
Girls don't want boyfriends they want FBE to react to Loona because that's what they deserve
Ok but BRENDON OH MY GOD 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

PLEASE LET THEM REACT TO I DOMT BELONG IN THIS CLUB BY WHY DONT WE AND MACKLEMORE!!!
Taylor has literally always done this. She creates puzzles for her fans to decipher. It's her thing. It started with a code in the lyric book of her albums and has moved on to these elaborate social media clues.
SHES A BUISNESS WOMAN!!!!!!
So many haters lol
damn if the taylor swift fans worked with the clique we’d take over the word
Thank you for choosing a good set of reactors most of the time the reactors you choose are just like "ugh I hate taylor swift"
This is the first album she’s releasing on a new label too. She was with Big Machine since she was a child. This next chapter is transformative for her. 
This next album is going to be revisiting the songs and experiences that built her, and made her who she is (ie: ME!). 
The 15 Taylor’s in the LWYMMD video are possible representations of the moments that she might be revisiting. 
She will almost certainly be releasing a pt 2 to  Love Story and I think it might even be the next single (Lover?). 
Love story was Taylor’s ode to Romeo and Juliet and was one of her first huge hits that set her career on fire. Most recently, Taylor unveiled a Butterfly mural by and artist with the name of Montague. I can’t imagine that this is any sort of coincidence.
LOL THAT GIRL IS ME! I GET TEASED FOR LIKING TAYLOR.
There are so many colors.... is the name of album spectrum ....
"I don't know why people are hating on this song" same girl, same.
everyone: Taylor Swift is so cryptic!

the clique: ...
It's about time ya'll react to it
Thank you for this video!!!!!!!
people have been asking Taylor to go back to her country roots since she released Red and started to stray away from the country world, but for how long her career is, she would not have had the same success she has now if she had stuck strictly to country. her country era is really good and definitely built her career, but the last time she wrote a pure country song was when she was 20/21. she's changed a lot since then. i think she just has a voice that can do both. she's a really talented songwriter and performer, and she just stepped out of her comfort zone and created more pop songs so she could stay relevant. i love country taylor, but i don't wish she could go back. she's just as good at pop as she is at country, and i don't think any artist should get shamed or hated on for wanting to change genres. especially artists who have careers of 10+ years.
They should react to Taylor's Me Live at the music Billboard awards 2019
without Taylor it would be better
Honestly would've sounded a million times better with Halsey or most other female artists. Tay Tay's voice was not good for this song. I'm not sorry
I feel like I am an odd person out not liking 1989, but loving reputation.


And really... what is country music anymore but pop music with a "twang"? (I say this as a lover of actual country music.)
This is so pretty video i am feeling so happy after watching this video 
😍
How can you marry somebodies voice ?
When LWYMMD came out yall get locals to react to it, now when ME! came out yall get Swifties to react to it I-

I get the video has fun visuals, but the song is so...childish? I keep expecting to see it referenced as the theme song of some kid's animated film.
It is impossible to hate #TaylorSwift haha 4:38
Am I the only one who got a Dua Lipa's  idgaf vibe at 1:40?
3:40 Flamboyant
2:28 why must every teenage girl in this day and age speak like this
I wish I was in a react video like this so I could scream "BEEBOOOOOO"
this is all I've been waiting for!
Ok but, why wasn’t Eric in this
gets flashbacks to him dancing to WANEGBT
Mk11 fatalitys reaction
okay. this is no hate at all. BUT i think that all the swifties think they are the first ones to do searching and tracking stuff down. Twenty One Pilots and the clique have been doing this for a while and having been a part of it, it is kind of sad that people keep saying how she is the first artist to do something like this. The hiatus for twentyonepilots was honestly one of the craziest and intense periods for clickies and we all analyzed everything. Taylor, i really like your music and have nothing but respect for you. I just hope that some swifties realize that this not some new abstract thing. certain artists just care enough.

She’s so sweet to do these for her fans❤️😁
12:40 the fact is wrong, it was 65.9m in 24h, not over 110m
"Mmm she's wearing country boots, can she go back to her county roots?" 🤣 love it.
Amd also 1+1+5=7
React to the evaluation of Taylor’s swifts music pleaseeeee!
the phone isn’t from the our song music video rip it’s from the rep tour
To the people saying 'why do you need to make everything meaningful?' and 'cryptic clues? look at Twenty One Pilots and BTS!', Taylor never said the clues were meant to be meaningful, they're just fun little clues for fans to decipher.
I'm a fan, but it' her worst single so far but I don't blame her, she needs to get the attention of everyone for her new era. Hoping the album will be good 🙏
a bop for sure 😍
TAYLOR DATED A MARVEL ACTOR AND A LOT OF THE FUN OF BEING A MARVEL FAN IS HOW INTENSELY PLANNED OUT THEY HIDE CLUES AND EASTER EGGS EVEN YEARS IN ADVANCE....IT ALL IS VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT AND PLANNED..SO I FEEL SHE TOOK A PAGE OUT OF THEIR BOOK.
THIS VIDEO IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULLLLLL!!!! SO IS BRENDON URIE!!! HE IS SO SO PRETTY!!! AND THE FACT THAT I KNOW BRENDON URIE HAS HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH OTHER SUPER ATTRACTIVE GUYS JUST INCREASES THE SEX APPEAL. ALL OF TAYLOR SWIFTS MUSIC IS SO CATCHY WHETHER ITS THE EDGIER SIDE OR THE SWEET SIDE...THIS SONG IS A BIT TOO CUTESY FOR ME BUT IT FITS SO WELL WITH THE VIDEO...BUT REGARDLESS OF IF ITS TOO CUTESY AND CHEESY FOR ME TASTE BUT THE WORLD MAY NEED MORE OF VIBES LIKE THIS!!! WE NEED POSITIVITY!!!
As the kids say, that's a bop

Brendon sold out on emo 😢😭😣😤
4:04 .....kaleidoscope eyes.....
I was hanging out watching "ME!" the night & morning it was released, and the counter froze for no less than TWO SOLID HOURS.
And that's just the hours that I personally watched the view counter not moving. The comments were full of people saying YT had already "stolen"/"taken back" around 10mil views before the freeze, so I am of the opinion that the total should probably be at absolute minimum 15-20mil higher than it already is.
Not the biggest fan of Taylor Swift...So if im going to listen to this song Id rather give FBE my view
Only Brendon can rock those suites❤💚💜💙💛😎

Nooo, I wanted really bad Eric to react to this ;-;
Which fanbase are the best detective 

Swifties = 😛
Sinners=😈
Clique=😵
This is a very mediocre taylor song honestly
Too much autotune for tonight
I love that they put in some of the hints...shows that taylor is absolutely passionate and cares, cause she knows we love figuring out all the clues and hints. Shes a bright, talented woman who deserve all the respect.
We look insane
Say what you want about Taylor but she knows how to work it. Her hype team and fans 👏🏻are 👏🏻on 👏🏻it👏🏻.
Honestly I WANT TO BE BEST FRIENDS WITH GAVIN ❤️❤️

Adults/Teens React to George Carlin
I think her new music video may be called calm, when her and brendon were having that argument he says calm in another language. However when she says it it is in English. Also, it could be signifying that she has calmed down since her reputation album came out.

PLZZ DO TAYLOR REACTING TO PEOPLE REACTING TO HER!💚💚
I’m not really a fan of the song itself but Brendon’s voice sounds so good in this!! Especially with Taylor!
I used to like her back when she was country.  I still can't stand Kanye West for interrupting her speech that year.  Her new stuff just isn't as good if you ask me.  I miss her old stuff, like Tim McGraw, Teardrops on My Guitar, and Picture to Burn.  Her new stuff just isn't as good.
No one:
Me in the middle of a conversation: 0:23
I’m only here for beebo
"My middle school self is freaking out" shes 15... her middle school self it's still her
This song isn’t for everyone. There are people who love it and people who hate it but at the end of the day nobody can say their wasn’t a lot of effort put into the song, video and marketing. In my opinion that is probably the most visually appealing video from any artist that I have ever seen. And Taylor and Brendon’s voices work so well together.
0:30 is it a boy or a girl ion even know anymore

Keeping your audience engaged is vital, whether your playing music, writing, giving an oral report our just talking to people. Taylor Swift is REALLY smart. Yeah, I'm a big fan.
The vibes I get from this song was similar to that of sicko mode mv

This song reminds me of kpop music videos, which is very fun. I don't love the melody, as it's not super interesting, but I do like them singing together; their voices harmonize well.
I rather just listen to Panic! at the disco by himself

React to vossi bop and earth
it was such a cute and positive song. there’s not a lot of songs that are about self love right now and that’s the main reason i love this song. this poppy upbeat song perfectly conveys that message of self appreciation and acceptance
I love him but I never was a big fan of Taylor. It's just not my music and I am not a big fan of her appearance. But that's just my opinion. The song is OK. To poppy for me but it's really is an interesting video
FUCK YES
hearing a positive reaction (well for the majority) when it comes to taylors music makes me so happy 🥺🥺
im not a total Taylor Swift fan but its actually good song. i heard it first on the radio i liked it and hearing Brendon Urie made it better. i totally didnt know it was taylor swift
i love how the first 2 females clapped at the start of the song :D
Favorite song

Taylor's new song had more plot development than Avengers: Endgame :|



Just to clarify, I was just trying to be funny, I love Marvel and am so hyped to see Endgame (I haven't seen it yet because all of the tickets are sold out!) I just thought it was a nice comparison because we've been waiting for Endgame for such a long time, and both the movie and the music video came out on the same day.

No hate no tea no shade :3
If I was there my reaction would be: HOLY CRAP WE’RE REACTING TO ME! YESSSSSSSSSS

Who else just came to this just for Brendon Urie?
When I saw that Taylor Swift was making a song with Brendon Urie I knew it was gonna be amazing. I was not disappointed <3
Its cool to see western artist doing these theories and spoilers too
I might be alone here, but I’m no longer a fan of Taylor.  I love Brendon.   Always have.  Taylor always has great videos, and this one is the same.  However, I just don’t care too much for her music anymore.
What bothers me about the clues Taylor's putting everywhere is that they don't have any artistic value - they're purely commercial. There are hints to the name of the new album and release dates and everything business-related. I guess it's fun to decipher but it's nothing that deepens the meaning of the art that is the music. It's not even hard to do.



Fans act like it's this is super clever thing. 
Which well yeah, it is. But only from a business point of view.
Yessah
They need to react to Tia Tamera!!!!!!
I WAS SO HOPING YOUD DO THIS!!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!! TAYLOR IS MY FAVORITE HUMAN 😭😭😭😭

Taylor Swift: Hee hee hee








Me: HEE HEE






sorry Michael Jackson reference
Both Brendon and Taylor have changed genres and their music has evolved overtime so it makes sense for them to collab. In order to stay relevant for as long as they have you have to keeping changing your music because if you think about it, not that many people have done that and stay super popular like they have.
BEEBO!!
Hate this song. Sorry but it’s just not my cup of tea.

Let teens/college kids react to Fancy twice
Generations react to the Bangtan Universe! It's the fictional storyline within BTS' music videos. The scenes have been being released since like 2014 or something and they're all out of order and fans have been making theories for YEARS. And it's still not over! The hints are everywhere though: music videos, other vids on their YouTube (highlight reels), on various Twitter accounts (made years ago but only discovered recently), and now there's even a webtoon that has slowly started revealing what has been going on! The universe is so dark and complex and there's references to old Italian stories and Renaissance art and armies have had to put all their knowledge together to help each other figure out what all the hints and hidden things in the background mean. It's an amazing work of teamwork! If you make a video on this, please research it A LOT beforehand to make sure you don't miss anything. This universe is VERY complex and far-reaching. Thank you! ❤️

I bought the 2019 Taylor Swift calendar, and noticed the wax stamps on some of the months, but never understood why they were only on some of the months. Now I know important things are most likely going to be announced on those days. For the December one I figured that was stamped because that is her birthday
4:08
i hope she does
The song was eh I do have to say it’s catchy and having brendon in it made it better but like I get the same feeling from it when I heard LWYMMD like it’s so mindless and I’m not even mad bc that’s what it was supposed to be j a “fun” song lol so it did its job
I like her music but as a person on how much people she hurt by saying all men are bad but I would love to get to know her as a person. Have you guys did the 20th anniversary of shady?

REACT TO KIZUNA AI PLEASEEEE
REACT TO PRETTYMUCH
Not a fan of Taylor Swift love Panic at the Disco though still can't get enough of high hopes and the only reason why I watched the music video and this episode was because of the visuals that Brendon Urie most likely brought into the video because it's just his style and not Taylor's at all. Other than that I most likely would have skip this episode.
Girlie is not special with the theories lol kpop groups have been doing that for years
I think gavin is a girl in the boy body
That girl who fangirled after Liza koshy is me!!
Please react to TWICE - Fancy
big hit just nervously smokes to the side compared to Taylor)
everyone hates this song, but I didn’t think it was that bad. Also Brendon Urie made it 100% better 🤣
I am a fan and i love you taylor swift
Honestly, I thought the song was really tacky. And the part when she went like “Spelling is fun!” Like wtf. Don’t come at me kids
I like that people call this song childish yet “happy” and “cant stop the feeling” we’re praised and “ME!” is just as equally as good.
Let's not forget the Selena Gomez instagram post

Bring Taylor and Brendon to The React Channel, They are nice they'll come :)
Not her best lyrics, but it is such a happy song and I love it❤😂
Imagine saying Taylor Swift formed you hahaha
Nobody noticed Brendon's high notes in the song 😒😒
I came here for Brandon. Was fucking disappointed.
4:54 "I´m like kind of quiet about it now because my friends tease me and stuff....but I will always be a Swifty 100%."
Giiiirrrrrrllll. Find you some new friends because yours ain´t it! A little friendly teasing is normal but if they tease you so much that you loose your voice. NO friends!

If possible can you react to utaites like Mafumafu-san, Amatsuki-san, Soraru-san and etc? I know they aren’t that popular but I just love their songs like Mafumafu-san’s Rinne Tensei/Reincarnation some kids will probably relate to this song. Ah I’m sorry for the long message but I do hope you can possible react to them^^
I can’t stand this song 🤦🏻‍♀️ I haven’t been a huge fan ever since 1989
I agree with the whole she started to go downhill when she started being full pop rather than country or country-pop
this song makes me so happy thanks taylor for curing my depression
Yay! Some actual Swifties, as well as people who aren't huge fans of her music yet show respect and appreciation for her hard work instead of mindlessly bashing her and insulting her because that's what was "cool" for a while. Appreciating that.
Brendon must have needed weed money
it's not my cup of tea but it's a cool song
REACT TO NOW UNITED PLEZ
This song sucked :(
I love this song
hey kids spelling is fun!
WE STAN TALENT. TAYLOR SWIFT Y'ALL!!!
I love that everyone is talking about how dedicated celebrities are to their fans. No celebrities marketing teams are dedicated to their fans, especially when their fans are 14 year olds and a bunch of basics on social media. Money well spent. Good Business. 🤦‍♀️

I’d put money on it that she had nothing to do with this other than signing her name on the contract for it to get started and taking some pictures then the the fans did everything else.

Ps. She didn’t pick the 🐍 emoji, she earned it when she got caught in a lie. She’s glad to be on to the “NEXT CHAPTER” because she’s trying to force this narrative out of peoples minds about her.

Didn't like Brendon's part. Taylor rocked as usual.
Hey kids, spelling is fun!
I personally like the song, but that’s just me. It’s obviously not for everyone
First time watching this music video, I like Taylor Swift and Bradon Urie, but that they don't have Panic! listed as the accompany group, honestly upsets me. It is an enjoyable song, but seriously, don't call yourself a compilation with Panic! unless you actually intend to HAVE the full band.


This generation is about POP and HIP-HOP, I can appreciate it! Just...actually be more honest about the individuals, songwriters, instrument players, and publishing songwriters that are actually present.
people dont realise she's always done this, for every album
3:36 does anyone else just think STRIKE UP THE BAND! OH OH THE CONDUCTOR IS BECKONING.


Lool "I constantly thank god for esteban" is a tune
Teens react to Sonic movie trailer
This one is not it. Too basic and childish. Her worst lead single and one of her worst songs. (love the MV and Brendon’s voice tho)
"spelling is fun" was the worst line in the entire song
4/26 is my birthday!!
I've seen smarter ways of dropping hints. The theories still continue to this day and it's a more complex story.
Low key happy that that the Sheila girl wasn't reacting

Best music video ever congrats Taylor
I didn't like the song when I first heard it, because it's so damn generic, but I listen to it over and over now just for Brendon Urie's parts. Because he has the voice of an angel.
I understand this is Taylor Swift's music vid, but they also should not forget Brendon Urie was there too, sorry if I am wrong. But why there was no question about him? Don't get me wrong, like the song & vid, but all the fuzz around TS is just too much for me.
Song is so bad honestly
Plz don’t hate it’s just my opinion
THE ALBUM NAME IS THE NEXT CHAPTER!
4:50  she literally summed up my life in a sentence
This should be called Taylor swift feat Panic at the disco
Taylor swift is the only artist who likes to make guesses and her fans do theories to what is to expect nxt. Swifties is the only fans who investigate so much.
Taylor is so genius and smart to go all way to do all this
👏😍
That song isn’t for me
Love it 😍

REPORTED SOME "REACT TO KPOP SHIZ" COMMENTS HAHAHAH
Tbh I listened to the song and I find it to be very simple and kinda boring. Brendon Urie outsings and outdances Taylor Swift. It's not for me
I'm sorry but the son is so girly .. as Taylor Swift soo ...
They should bring Taylor Swift to react to this video.

you freak out about Taylor giving hints and having theories, etc. BUT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT KPOP THEORIES OF THEIR MV's. BTS has literally their own universe on their videos. If you are interested, you should totally react to the BTS universe on their MV's, please, it would be so damn fun.
I literally only listen to it because of Brendon but it's also kinda catchy
3:39 lol wtf
You forgot the END GAME thing. Her song with future and ed sheeran says "reputation precedes ME!" It really is so extra but I just don't want to relate it to End Game in 4.26 Come on!!!
Swifties are literally the FBI like they spent their time counting the holes in the fence 💀😂
WE DONT DESERVE THIS COLLAB
It’s not a serious song, so calm down. It’s just fun and the video is so much fun. Stop being grumpy.
I've been waiting for this😂
Didn't expect to be only one who thinks this is shit song
The song and video are just bland, but what makes me throw up in my mouth is the gushing reactions some of these people have.
Its not the best songs In the World but its by far a step in the right dirction

You have to give it to Taylor.  Whether you like the song or not (for the sake of clarity, I do), she knows how to promote her material and surrounds herself with the right team to help her do so.
Finally some appreciation for Taylor's cleverness.
Also if you think Taylor's fans are great at deciphering her clues just check out the skeleton clique/banditos- twenty one pilots fans. They could be real life detectives.
i loveee these reactions taylor really is the queen of everything and ME! makes me so incredibly happy whenever i listen to it. im so excited for ts7 its insaneeee
This song will win the Grammy for 'Song of the Year- Trash category'.
My current self is always freaking out and over joyed when Brendon Urie shows up in anything ever. My favorite part of this video is when they are in the marching band outfit and she puts her leg up on him but he just looks at her leg like im not going to touch it. Lol He's like I'm married to Sara and won't be touching Taylor's leg.
Only here for my boy Brendon Urie. :D You can rock anything hun.
People need to chill. If someone doesn't like this song, y'all Swifties attack that person like it's blasphemy. If someone signs up to be in the public eye or create art, he/she signs up for criticism as well. How can you force people to like this song? You ask people to get lost because they say the song is childish. I agree people can be a bit too harsh expressing their opinions and you have the right to tell them their wrongdoing but a simple comment gets so much hate. Everyone knows how successful Taylor Swift is and that she has many awards etc but that doesn't make her unworthy of criticism does it?

Please react to BTS music videos and theories explaining . Kinda tired of having people assume kpop music is just “colorful “ or happy vibes . There’s more beyond then just what you see . 

Examples of songs 

-I need U : address mental health , depression , etc 

- save me : talks about needing someone by they’re side when they’re going through tough times . 

- Spring day : this music video has so many theories but mainly Addresses the sewol ferry incident . A song dedicated to the loss lives of 300 high schoolers . 

-Mic drop ( Steve Aoki remix ) : this is actually a diss track to they’re haters who doubted their success . But still Lit af ! 

Help me out Army ! Please get fbe to do this !
Please react to the new Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer! They compared the genie in Aladdin, now it's time to compare another blue character!
Teens or youtuber react to Tana Monjo getting a tv series on MTV
Im a panic fan. This is just so sad for the panic community in my opinion.
They react to this over Hollywood Undead. This is sad.
Eh, best part is brenden urie tbh
JOJO!! This is my last Hamon!!...... TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Need this song more than I need myself 💛
Gavin is ME!
You should have teens and Adults react to the T.V show  ,"You, me and the Apocalypse."
react to fancy twice
Ugh why am I the only one who likes super poppy songs like this?
Can you please do elders reacting to Lil peep😀😉
React TXT Cat and Dog
React to ajr
Yeah my friends tease me for being a swiftie, but I'll still be it quietly

it was Disney kind of song

I saw a thing saying that this video is throwing a LOT of shade towards her exes, mainly Tom Hiddleston
 https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/8949866/taylor-swift-blasts-tom-hiddleston-me/
Brendon Urie? More like Brendon Urine.
react to tomorrow x together please!!!!
CHECK OUT MY VERSION!: https://youtu.be/SXsWtMGMKuY
But that's just a theory, UH SWIFTY theory. Thanks for watching. (Sorry MatPat, if you see this. Couldn't resist)
On the award show speech shown on this video, Taylor was wearing a disco ball outfit which is a reference to her collaborator on ME!, Panic! At The Disco.
I watched the video for Brendan. his voice is so good. the lyrics are shit
React to lil dicky-Earth
We need Taylor reacts to this pls!!!!!
Say if they think Taylor Swift fans are crazy with theories, they haven't seen all the shit Tøp gave us between Blurryface and Trench have they?
They just don't know what ARMY's go through with all BTSs theories
But I still luv TS anyways
I've always love your reactions. Can you please react to GFRIEND. Their songs may not suit your taste because people often say that they have "cute" songs but their songs are really good. They uses a lot of instrumental. And instead of reacting to their music videos, please react to their  choreography because their dances are actually really hard.  They are known to be a very synchronized group. You can try reacting to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBSeNveqpx0 (their hardest choreography),  (their most recent song with such beautiful choreography),  (just beautiful and amazing), and 
But have you heard what ARMY goes through 😂
For the first time in a while I've seen a good video from FBE keep up the work
Wow this song is awful
Please have Taylor Swift react to this
My two favorite people❤️❤️
Interviewer: So what motivated and inspired you to be a detective? 

Me: Taylor Swift....
React to human target by thy art is murder plz
Lets be honest, Panic! Fans only listened to the song for Brendon.
Only reason I watched it, was cause of Brendon Urie not cause of Taylor Swift. Any Panic! Fans in the house?
"How far does this rabbit hole goes?" we are all exhausted, crying and counting holes fences. THERE WERE FIVE OK?? WE SHOULD BE PAID FOR THIS!!
Too poppy

I love that snake in the intro tho 😂
💓🐍💓🐍💓
I freaking love this song!
React to Grandson please
When people say like "Oh, this song is too poppy", I'm like "This is what the music industry needs right now!" There's been too much depressing trap music in this day and age, so I think this song is a breath of fresh air, and I stan for it!
Dude, 4:50 I relate so much to this. Cause Taylor is literally the one thing from my childhood come straight up to now that I've stuck with and she HAS influenced me so much! Its just so sad how many people hate her or don't appreciate just how amazing she is!
React to countryhumans ( react to the ships in the fandom )

I've been waiting for this video!
Pls react to kpop girl group mamamoo live performances.pls pls
I love Taylor Swift and I avidly enjoy Brandon Urie's music, but I just can't get onboard with this song. It looks like Easter puked all over it in terms of the video and this song is just way too bubblegum pop. I want the Taylor Swift from "I did something bad," not the Taylor from whatever this thing is. :/
Oh my god the first time people aren’t reacting very negatively towards her. I’m so happy because she deserves the most!!
How many effects do you want in this video?

Taylor Swift: Yes

I actually hate this dong and music video xd. I didn't like Brendon urie in it but I'm ok with it now
2:21 marry poppins who😂
They say its Generations React,, but why only adults and teens? Where's the Kids react? Because teens and adults following the teases and facts? or Because they know more and have watched Taylor's new single?
And then you have Brendon sending potatoes to fans as cryptic evidence and hints during the Pray For The Wicked era.....
I thought Brendon was in the vid, but no.
Yayayaya you guys finally reacted
1:15 fun fact: what they did to taylors voice there is called zedd's effect, he literally uses on every song, its basically layering the vocals multiple times each layer in a different note while also playing a really harsh saw wave in the background.
EDIT: You can also control the melody of the saw wave so you can make the singer sound like they are singing another song.
Illuminati confirmed!
Hey, could you please react to Phases by Prettymuch they are very underrated
First time a positive reaction for Taylor or else every time they just bash her
Yaaaas brendon
YES!
It’s not good reactions when everyone’s seen it already
ghot
PLs react to RED VELVET
Teens react to Ava Max
2:48 Wow Britney! That's a first coming from you.
"You'll never find another like me" - uh, if it isn't working, why would he go looking for the same thing and not something different?
Stever Earl, I think, has a song with a similar premis and I had the same thought then - why would she want someone just like him (his song character), when she didn't want the original version?
The “learning is fun” ruins the entire song tbh
Please react to Netflix 'reputation' Stadium Tour!

React to Love+Fear by Marina!!!
Plus, there's this lyric in Taylor Swift's End Game from last album that goes, "REPUTATION PRECEDES ME!" NOW TELL ME TO CALM DOWN
It’s taylor, thats it. The song isn’t that good & sounds like a disney musical tbh
I love Brendon Urie... I hate Taylor Swift... therefore, this song is terrible in my opinion!
DO lil peep come on lets goo please
i'm sure that all of them have seen this video already.........its taylor swift man nobody misses her music video
so im in the family @riverfishing(13) lol
so people actually think this song is good....This song was just not my cup of tea.
I wish they´d put in some people with different/vastly different taste and opinion about genre of music, instead of all the people seemingly leaning towards the "ok this is cute"/pop is OKOK - to get some different reactions and remarks & opinions
Seriously though... Who decided that the song needed to keep "SPELLING IS FUN!!"
hey guys i did a cover of this song so feel free to check it out
Congratulations 2
Yes.... FBE & Taylor Swift
I'm her demographic and find her music boring... she was much better country but you do you I guess. It sounds too much like a kid's song, which I get was her point because kid = fun, but ehh... It's alright. It just sounds so commercial. The video though, I love visually. And Brendon Urie. The man's a chameleon, what else can you say? Taylor is the white Beyonce... so overhyped and predictable by trying so hard to be unique.
Lol 😂
FINALLY have been waiting for this 😂😂
This song was supposed to appeal to the new generation so Taylor can secure a fanbase that adjusts to all sorts of ages, so if you think it's childish then you probably get the point.
Let them react to EARTH by lil dicky
6:20
Me: TØP fans are even crazier
god i fucking love brendon urie
I honestly didn't like the song dkshs
you should've put the same reactors from the "Look What You Made Me Do reaction", i want to see their reaction because on the LWYMMD they were sending so much hate
So I guess the old Taylor is back?
Her Marketing team is god like
I love the fact that everyone is finding out these clues. And like ppl think it’s so unique. But like........ there is ||-// who’s been doing stuff like this for a while and all the fans (clique) goes crazy tho. 😂 like we go deep 😂💛
Eh... pretty bland honestly
React to the weirdest song ever..... maroon 5's Animals
React to Dylan Locke!!
Just what I needed 😫
REACT TO THE TNT BOYS
You should let the reactors know not to watch a video so that their reactions can be fresh
I love how they think Swifties go deep into theories. You have no idea how deep BTS theories go, like dàmn that's why I don't mess with it. All it takes is a member to breathe and you'll see ARMY ask things like "What's this? Does it mean anything?!"

P.S. I know the video's about Taylor but I just had to mention this fact. Great music video and the songs cool :)
Thank you for only choosing positive people to react to this positive song. It's what this song deserves.

4:06 for real 💅🏽. In my opinion her new songs are horrible but that’s just my opinion. I used to love her country music, and I don’t even like country haha.
I so badly want to like this song. I liked Taylor when I was younger and I absolutely love brendon not to mention the music video is incredible. I wish so bad I liked the song cause it would be so perfect but I just don't.
React to Endgame movie (with spoilers)
Am I the only one that thinks that a brendon’s solo version would be great? I mean, I know it’s Taylor’s song but Brendon’s voice is soooooo good

Unpopular opinion : i love this song, because it's a catchy pop song and we need more like it instead of teaching our younger generation how to shake their ass and curse
Why no kids? :,(
React to sonic trailer
I LOVE Brendon Urie but I do not like this song and it’s all Taylor’s Fault!!
Love Brendon Urie and this video, but the song is just ok.

This is God.

Any Generation plays Sonic.exe
The video is beautiful but the song is not my cup of tea lol
Last girl that said "You'll never find another like me" I responded with "Thank god for that!"
The genre of ME! is bubblegum pop, so its meant to be childish. I think she did it on purpose. "SPELLING IS FUN!" XD
i like brittany..shes honest..and shes not ass kisser like everyone else in this video
I need Kids React to this song😂 cause everyone hating this song said ME! is too childis. So ineed Kids React this song.
"She's wearing country boots, can she go back to her country roots?" Burn lmao
That moment when the girl said 'my friends tease me' is actually kinda sad. Coz a lot of us experienced that. People seem to just judge us because we like Taylor. But at the end of the day, we stan the kindest, smartest person in the industry. That's not gonna stop our love for her. 💗
Generations react to Avi Kaplan
We Love Detective Swifties!
That video was so 2008
Yall really should do a reaction to Beyonce's Homecoming.

This song is so Katy Perry

I see people in the comments ranting about how people in the reaction video need to stop hating on the song and not liking it? 
Pop music and Taylor swift is for girly girls only!
it’s my two favorites so i was so excited when this came out
Time to change depressing dark pop culture right now. This is what I need.
Jordan: I want to marry Brendons voice
Me: honestly same. 
Also, this song may not be for everybody, but let's just remember that Taylor and Brendon probably worked very hard on this video. ❤❤❤
Taylor Swift made a comeback with this song
I like the video and the song
Love this collab and a love both of them
you should react to guardin
"some fans are theorizing this era is about kaleidoscopes..."


KALEIDOSCOPE EYES AIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Am i the only one watching thing thinking it's crap? Just more auto tune teeny bopper filler rubbish to feed to the fans who i personally think wouldn't know good music if it jumped up and drop kicked them in the face * Drop's the mic and steps off the soapbox*
I’m here for Brendon, I have a feeling I’m not the only one...
I feel like I was in a simulation watching this video with all those hints lol.
Everytime I see/hear Jim speak I fast forward, he's just too negative, I just can't. 🙄
Teens or Adults react to Fancy (Twice) please!
Aggressively rees in brendon urie

Ugh people need to recognize Brendon more then they do
Do Teens or College students react to Egoraptors 3 Legend of Zelda Rap songs

Everyone: oh it's Taylor
Me: why is no one noticing bren?????
IM HERE FOR MY QUEEN!!! 😊❤️❤️❤️❤️ SWIFTIE FOR LIFE 🦋✨
oh YESS! I Iove all the positive feedback tswift is getting!! 💗💗💖
I mean I agree that the song is a little childish, but honestly who cares. It's fun and catchy! Not all songs need to be taken seriously or have deep lyrics. We all know Taylor comes with the lyrics throughout the album so what's wrong with her just having fun with one song? People are way too negative.
EEEEEAARRRRTTHH
EARTH
“She wearing country boots, Could she go back to her country boots”  Damn!!
This is ACTUALLY one of my favorite music videos EVER!!
Watching this every day at least twice LOL
I CANT GET OVER BRENDON SPEAKING FRENCHHHH

Mom: Wake up! Taylor Swift made a new song!
Me: mmm... slep...
Mom: and Brendon Urie is in it!
Me: 
“When she went full pop that’s when I started to care less” GIRL PLZ go listen to “Tied together with a smile” or “the outside” and then try to tell me that THATS what you want
"I wanna marry his voice"
Same girl
Honestly it’s not a bad song! I just wouldn’t listen to it regularly.
Aiko is so cute🥰
They need more entertaining actors, this wasn’t very good.
I don't think this is a positive song. It's got some toxic ideas. "No one will ever love you like me." That's abuser level shit.
but the point of breaking up is to not find someone like who u broke up with
for the love of god Please React To SEVENTEEN
I can’t believe people hate songs these days because they think it’s “too positive.” Like wtf? Is that really a reason to hate a song? People like that need more happiness in their lives
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Brendon urie is the best
I HATE ALL YOUR REACTORS THEY HATE TAYLOR SWIFT SO MUCH WHILE SHE JUST WANTS TO SHARE HAPPINESS TO THE WORLD
"can't she go back to her country roots?" No she can't.
I love Brendon Urie thats all.

I wouldn't care if it was the worst song ever made...if Brendon Urie is singing, I'll listen.
Shit
I don't know why happy songs bother people so much. I think happiness bothers people so much these days.... People always say is too pop, too country, too dark, too this, too that.... Why can't they enjoy a song without labeling it?
Country music ain't it. Pop is where its at.
i hate this song
love taylor swift  so much
“This is the collab i needed that i didn’t know i needed”
SAME

One thing about Taylor Swift: She's a genius
2:44 same. Her previous songs in the previous album sounded better tbh. The people who are fawning over this song in this video sound like they are hypnotized 😂
Taylor and her Team is really smart. 👑
“They sound magical together” it’s called auto tune dummy there not good singers.
I’m only here for Brendon 😗

I LOVE BOTH OF THEM SM OH MY GOODNESS
As a Panic!/Brendon fan, I am so proud of B, and so happy for him. Collaborating with such a huge artist, and of an artist hes been a fan of, I cant imagine how much it means to him to work with Taylor. I've never seen him so happy
When I heard this song I thought it was for a kids movie. I thought the old Taylor was dead but I guess just for Reputation lol

React to the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer
i’m so happy that most of the opinions are positives, taylor is really smart, she can write more “inteligent” or “deep” songs, but that’s what she wants, she realises 2 or 3 really pop and then has the songs that her fans want. She is a smart girl who doesn’t deserved all the hate that she gets

Im never a big fan of the first song on a new Taylor swift album but I am very excited for the rest of the album and I love how Taylor puts out subtle hints promoting her new songs and albums
Stans hate it but the locals love it. We won
Brendon is my everything but this song is so sooo boring
Glad to see more reactors that are Taylor Swift fans!
I feel like the theme of all of Taylor’s new songs are going to be referencing all her old eras

You should react to BTS theories. Once you go in, you can’t get out.
Hi
I love how all of her later music videos corresponds with past songs and references to her own life. It makes it like marvel with so many Easter eggs, it’s like Taylor has her own cinematic universe ❤️👏🏻😍
FBE more like FBI OPEN UP

I'm not super into these artists (due to ignorance, not taste), but just seeing a comments section bursting at the seams with love for them is wonderful. I hope they get to see this.
I love their voices together! ❤️

No one:
Literally no one:
Not a single soul:
Taylor: Spelling is fun!
🤣
to be honest this whole thing reminds me of TRENCH with all the clue and theories...btw stream trench lol ||-//
It's called me because the dancers in the music video can be relatable   to you.
I hope taylor make at least one country song in TS7
The video threw up Easter color everywhere. Lol
I Love Brandon Urie voice.
Nice calibration, cute song. Something I wouldn't listen to all the time though.
I did not like the snake in that because I hate snakes.
This song really grew on me, at first I didn't really like it but now it's catchy. As a Taylor and Brendon fan this collab was really cool. The clues and investigating reminds me of BTS's music, how come all the artists I like do this 😆.
The girl with the big hair is soooo pretty!

Relaxing and beautiful music 👏
Taylor said herself is a fun pop domg no a serius more music entersting one
I like songs like this. I know its silly but...I study law and every day I go to the library to sit in there for hours and study and it can get really depressing at times even tho I know why I do it. But listening to upbeat euphoric songs like this on my way to the library that glorify selflove and happiness and sassiness makes me motivated to study and get better every day.
Adults react to Twice - Fancy
Yeet I'm early, also Pretty. Odd vibes bc it's crazy
WHERE IS ADAM
Did anyone else come here to second-hand watch the MV without actually watching the MV? lol

I used to be a big t-swift fan, not because I like country (I don't) but I liked her older songs, up until 1989 and everything that followed that was completely pop...I just feel like she changed so much and who she really is...idk her...it's like a roller coaster of emotions and now she's going back to bubblegum pop...idk man I don't get it. Respect T-swift, but don't LOVEEE her.
Taylor Swift's video has so many Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz references.
“It’s too poppy.” What’s so bad about a POP song being unabashedly POP? It’s a nice change of pace from alllll the songs on the charts nowadays
Elders react to Red Dead 2 endings
That song came out on my birthday
Teens react to AJR
This might just be me but, I feel like people only like it because it has Brendon in it.  I feel like people should appreciate Taylor more! I'm a Swiftie!!!  But it just might be me..
“I’m so not her demographic” same

“I do not care for the song it’s too poppy” same
No fan wars, but kpop puts so much anticipation and theories in their videos which is more mesmerising just saying
Guys can you react to Madonna's Medellin music video and Mariah Carey'a A No No music video.
In her song End Game there is a line "reputation proceeds me". That song was in the album reputation meaning reputation proceeds the song me!. also Me! Released on the same day as the movie end game. Marvel and Taylor are in cahoots
Omg Im kinda early!
ME! is such a BOP
I freakin love this song!!!!Am I alone?
You should react to the band Alice In Chains
Might be an unpopular opinion but I don’t really like this song 🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
I only found out about this song because I was searching up beebo's name and then it popped up so I listen to it but at first I didn't like it but it's a bop
Putting Brendon Urie made it 10x better
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU GUYS TO REACT TO THIS VIDEO!!! AHHH I LOVE BRENDON!!!
YAY😍
I like this song but it's lowkey cheesy with the "awesome/me" like......... eh
i get kpop vibes from this mv
I need some swiftamine 🤗
You should never be quiet about who you are and what you love. If you do bc your friends will make fun of you then you shouldn't be friends with them, end of story.
Tommorow is march day
I Love This Song SO MUCH!!!!
two vocally talented legends, stream me!
I didn't literally suggest this, but I was hoping that they were going to do this exact video.
I actually saw the video right after it came out basically. I don't know when it came out exactly, but before I went to school, I watched it in the morning. I was just like, "I would never have thought she would do a song with Brendon Urie from panic! at the disco."
I've been a Taylor Swift since I was in 1st grade. Thank you Emilia for getting me started on her music!
Jim gtfo
I can't wait for Taylor's new album
My birthday was on April 26th 🥳
This song was a BOP 😍👌😂
Hate the song but I can't help if I love Taylor Swift to the Moon and back! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Great video, meh song
i want to hate it...but i dont
Yyyyyyyaaaaaasssssss
Pop Country or FULL BLAST POP... Taylor makes GOOOOOOD music...
On behalf of Swifties everywhere, thank you for sparing us the embarrassment of showing them the five holes in the fence.
My guess: The album cover is something to do with the beginning of the music video, like "Calm" , or maybe something French? Because it seems a little random to have the beginning of the video unrelated to the song :P
Everyone: OMG I LOVE THIS
Me: I FRICKIN HATE THIS SONG
Taylor Swift ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do kids react to Joanna ceddia
Tbh, the only part I like about the mv is Brendon 🤷🏽‍♀️

Whenever I watch a React video that includes Brendon Urie:
"Okay, guys, can you stop reacting for just a second I'm trying to watch the video... oh wait"
This whole reaction is weird, people saying wow for some dumb cryptic messages about a music video...A MUSIC VIDEO
Can we please react to Mariah Carey hits she needs her own episode #lambily
"that's so extra" me, it's literally so dumb lmao
This song is too popy which I didn't liked at first but later made me realize that I've grown up listening to popy cute song that made me happy and I'm glad that Taylor did that to me in 20l9
Brandon 🤮
I hate that he stooped to this level like I mean it's not HORRIBLE and it's catchy but it sounds like a jingle or theme song but it's so cheesy and just Brendon c'mon but yeah their voices do sound good together AHHHH I'm so conflicted
Play mk11
I am so ready for this era! I wasn’t, a huge reputation fan cause it was so dark. I’m a rainbows and bright colors kinda gal.
I wanna see like teens or adults react to classical music like Chopin or Tchaikovsky, just to see how a generation who grew up with rap and pop would interpret classical music and what their opinion of it is as a genre
Taylor screams
Man: You need to calm down
Taylor still yelling: I AM CALM
I only watched it for Brendan, I hated the rest of it though

Yeah I'm not a fan of this song
ok but brendon snapped
my thoughts for people who have rude things to say about the song: 12:24 - 12:26
Can y'all do about T-Pain winning The Masked Singer?
What about the mural .....
I think each month on the calender (April, may, July and August) will have a single released then. And the album will b released in December. This makes sense bc there is a Christmas tree in the "ME" music video
Yasss I was waiting for this
ITS MY BIRTHDAY
I only watched this because of Brendon. I mean how can you not love BRENDON BOYD URIE! Even though I typically hate pop music, I love this collab! I think I like Taylor Swift now....
THE ONE WHERE THE STORY OF US SONG BLEW MY MIND
I’m not even a big Taylor Swift fan and I may not like THIS song, but she just pulled this off so flawlessly. Especially The Story Of Us song, since 2010!!!! WOAH, the planning and all the hints.
"She's wearing her country boots can't she go back to her country roots" at 4:07 😂😂😂😂😂 I can't lol
React to Evanescence please!!! 😊😊❤❤😅😅
The story of us lining up with the release date of me reminded me of how BTS new album relates back to their debut album like boy with luv cool to see artist do this kind of stuff so the fans can figure out the theories and hints

React to ABBA?
Okay, but Twenty One Pilots took a 2 year hiatus and during that time sprinkled cryptic messages all around social media and old music videos. Made a website that had nothing but cryptic messages and a letter that the fans had to decipher out. After the release of the music video of Jumpsuit, that's when the pieces started to fall into place about this world that they had created called Dema and the old character from their last album blurryface (Nicolas Bourbaki) started to all make sense and had the fans start theorizing and researching like no other.
I want to marry all of him
Taylor also said that there are clues in the video and in the lyrics of ME! that relate to upcoming videos and songs and even as far forward as her next tour.
cool video the song Idc for and ppl need to get a damn life lol

I don't know how I feel about the song, but I'm always down for Beebo, and the video was really cool.
Hahahaha. I love this. I'm screaming. I can't wait for Taylor's new music. I have always wanted Taylor and Brendon to collaborate. And was just in disbelief when it was initially announced that I thought it was gonna be terrible and their voices weren't gonna mesh together well at all. Boy did that disbelief turn around into "I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THIS SONG"
Taylor go back to country and Brendon go back to rock. Stop with this pop BS!

The music video itself is amazing. Too good for this song.
I AM SO HAPPY! Because there's cats in the vid :)
These people have no taste in music, this song is as generic as it gets
Selena also gave a clue when she dedicated an instagram post to Taylor for her birthday, she put "ME!" in a part of the dedication. I love what Taylor do and I love her fans.
“Taylor Swift fans really go all out” LMAO just watch Twenty Øne Piløts fans we are literally detectives
Cool song and vid but way too much pastels for me.
Umm. Even though I love happy concepts (Twice, Red Velvet), this song isn’t my favorite. Maybe I’m too used to kpop lol.
BTS beat taylor?? DAMNN
These fans have no competition to the Skeleton Clique (Twenty Øne Pilot's fan base). Just saying...
I'm with Jim.
if they love theories so much they would love bts...you can learn alot from being an army....its much deeper than this though..
Bad reaction because they are almost watch MV. Prefer reactors who never watch this MV before. Sorry guys😓😞

Brittany seemed a bit down in the dumps for this video lol. She said the song wasn’t worth the hype but that’s only because she’s not a fan. Taylor does all that cryptic stuff for the fans so of course it’s worth the hype.
React to AJR
Btw guys Brendon urie was also in this song, can we talk about him, he was the only part of the song I cared about
Brendon carries this song for me tbh, could never get into Taylor
Dude... TWENTY ONE PILOTS did criptic messages for the fans for years. They even went into a Hiatus for a year.
No tweets, no posts .... Nothing.
That offended me a little bit but Brendon Urie is in the video so I'm good.
As a 41 year old man... I freaking love this song / video.
You can hate Taylor Swift but you can't deny she is the smartest person on the music industry. period

oh my gawd just give it up country Taylor will never come back
This is absolute trash.
I have a new found appreciation for Gavin!!! Fellow Swiftie!
TWO ICONS WE STAN
I don’t understand why people hate her for changing...like everyone change once in a while and Taylor Swift choose to change to pop! I just think is a dumb opinion to say. Like if you hate her for her voice, ok, if it’s something else, ok, but for changing...I just don’t understand why hate because of that...
while it’s not her best song, taylor’s best songs are always deeper cuts and not singles. furthermore, the music video makes this song so much better (absolutely stunning), and, therefore, i am so excited for this era as it looks so so beautiful.
Plain lyrics - generic pop = Why she’s so popular?
look what you made me do reaction: UGH I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT 
me! reaction: OMG I LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT


everyone just goes with the vibe i hate yall
Taylor Swift fans: Omg she's so cryptic. Nobody can be cryptic like her!!

I do like the reactions (this video) but this song I just can't get behind. This type of song is the reason why I don't love all of Taylor Swift songs and it is not the reason why I listen to Brendon Urie's songs.

Same Jim same
This is honestly my new favorite song. My theme song. Its so perfect.
Taylor Swift is too old for this heartbreak shit. Just get married already and settle the fuck down.
Taylor's voice sounds very soft in this song and Brendon is as good as he is 😊 Didn't think I would like it but yes, it's funny to listen to :)
Wayyyyyy Toooooooooo Cheeeeesy
When the song is meh, so you hide it in a good music video.

I like jim, he may not be a fan of taylor but he wasn't hateful about it (*cough* ethan, krychelle, Sharon, brooklin, *cough*)
She's basically coping what the kpop industry has been doing since forever...

I know I've heard the song a few times already and sure, they're all here for Taylor and all since it's her song, but can they not talk over Brendon Urie's part please?

I'm not really a Taylor Swift fan, but I love Brendon Urie.

WAIT so yall sit there and act like she didnt adopt a cat on the set?
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS

TBH I love this collab. The song’s okay, but as long as I know that Taylor and Brendon have collabed.
Taylor Swift fans: OMG!!! She's dropping so many hints for her new single and album!! Thats so different!!
ARMY's: LMFAO welcome to the party
i don't support the ideal that this song projects.
The english accent at the start..oof
Swifties UNITE
I never liked Taylor and this song sounds like something she's already made a few years ago.
Nevertheless her marketing team - top tier benchmarking. They started doing what K-Pop has been doing for years.
I actually love the song so much and I will never stop listening it
You should've included teasers from the Elle essay!

This is such a 🅱️USSY 🅱️OP reference (CrankThatFrank)! But no this song is such a banger/bop! I brought it on iTunes as soon as I watched the video!

Funny thing is these are just the popular theories they won’t see the crazy one the fandom has it’s unreal
not to downplay taylor swift cuz i like her and the hints/dates were pretty cool but them being mindblown by all taylor's cryptic stuff, y'all really need to do a video on all twenty one pilot's cryptic stuff and you'll actually be mind blown. honestly the clique is the real fbi
I literally cant stand this song. Her fans blindly follow her music without actually listening to the composure and lyrics. But whatever right to each their own

14:32 LOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUDERRRRRRRR!
Yes yes yes!!!!! I’m so happy you did a reaction to this!!!!! Taylor and Brendon were so cute, their chemistry is everything!!! This collaboration was what we didn’t know we needed the King and Queen has blessed us with as masterpiece!!! This song just makes me so happy and puts me in such a good mood!!!!!! Plus how clever Taylor has to be to come up with all these clues she really loves and appreciates every single one of her fans!!!!!! Swifties are true detectives I’m a huge Taylor fan but never able to figure out the clues this fast.
0:01 My exact reaction
React to the PewDiePie ending the sub to PewDiePie meme.
oh, so you react to this but not to Two Of Us, sure sure
Yes Brendon yes.  just yes.
I'm Ready to Goooo...get me out of my mind, get me out of my mind.       If any of you know what song I'm referencing from Panic!. I'll give you a hint it's from Vices and Virtures.      This video reminds me of that song.
“(Making music) is not always fresh for me, there have been times where I needed to take years off because I felt exhausted or really low or really bad, so you never really have the same process making an album. Right now, thankfully I feel really energized, which I’m feeling really grateful for, like it’s not something that I take for granted, that I feel this energized and this excited about this new music, because now I know that’s not always how you feel like. Sometimes you can just feel really scared of everything, so I’m very very conscious of how I do feel about this new music and how there’s such excitement surrounding it. I try to take sort of a mental emotional snapshot of that and just remember that I’m really lucky that I get to feel this way” - Taylor on the evolution of her songmaking process over the years
Taylor makes shit music...
Such a bad song...
They definitely never met ARMY or the Clique fandom now THAT'S where complicated theory's are.
But I think it's cool that Taylor is doing this, I think it's entertaining for the fandom and a cool experience

Edit: please don't do fanwars bcs of this, NO ONE owns the theory's thing I saying that they are not the only ones and in this vid looks like is something new and a lot of fandoms have theory's of their faves and that's cool
I have mixed feelings about this song, love the beginning and end but the middle seemed very childish for both of them
please react to greta thunberg
Taylor using kpop level theory countdowns now aswell?
I hope someday for a react to World Order music videos, specially Have a Nice Day, Permanent Revolution, Singularity, In New York, and Let's Start WW3.
No I don't want the flowers
No I don't want the ring
Yes I want the kitten
Finaalyyyy the clues had the attention they needed.
Okay, but Twenty One Pilots.
Please react to BTS Dionysus, and PLT Hocus Pocus
Really? People are dying and instead of helping with ACTUAL things that are ACTIALLY IMPORTANT they investigate Taylor Swift clues? Can’t relate.
This song is such shit
Many are saying it's generic pop of 2015 but it is far better then 365 and 7 rings.
1:13
Her: Don't you tell a woman to calm down..
Me: Yeah you can't tell them anything anyway..
        Or it will be a harassment SOON..
Who else thought brendon was going to be reacting.




No. Just me. Ok.
THIS WAS SO POSITIVE! I'm glad people who aren't her fans can appreciate how much work and time she puts into her craft to make it extra fun and special for us <3
Teens and Adults react to the Fruits Basket reboot.
THANK YOU I FUCKING LOVED THIS VIDEO
Well I'm not that big of a Taylor's fan but I do admit that she gets it... 

I kinda dig her first albuns... Very country and popish... More like her style... Shake It Off was when I stopped caring like someone said in the video 😂

This song tho... 😅 I think she's smart bringing him to make other type of audience to get to know her songs... Me included... I'm gonna be honest... When it first came out, I thought "ok just doing this for Brendon"... Turns out the song is really fun... Might stick out for others songs... Not gonna look for clues but... 😋

I love her dress
I am not her biggest fan but she really puts a whole lot of effort starting years ago. It's impressive.
I just watched it before, I came for an extra treat this time ❤️
Am so neutral about this song. I won't skip it if it comes on a playlist, but I won't go search it either.

IT’S THE LEAD SINGLE.

It doesn’t completely reflect what the album is going to be all about. It’s supposed to be very pop, to attract more juvenile public, to be catchy and radio station worthy. It’s called strategy.

“It’s really hard to pick which (song) is going to be a representative that just goes out first because there isn’t ever one song that could just sum up what the album is but I knew that this one, it felt like a celebration, it felt like something that could make you feel good”
most viewed video by a female solo artist?? are we just ignoring brendon's existence in the song?? lmfao
IM GONNA SAY THIS AGAIN, ITS A LEAD SINGLE, ITS MEANT TO BE “BASIC” SO IT APPEALS TO THE MASSES, THE REAL STUFF IS ON THE ALBUM
“I went into the studio with Joel Little and we finished half of it and realized we wanted it to be a duet with like a love interest type of thing with two sides of a relationship with “you’re not gonna leave me, I’m not gonna leave you, you know I’m special, and we’re special”"

THIS IS THE BEST.  SGE DESERVES ALL OF THIS
“I think that when we talk about being happy or loving yourself, it’s what we feel sometimes, and this song is a glimpse of the moment where we feel like we’re having the best day, the sun is shining, it’s gonna be an okay day”
Taylor on #ME: “I want to feel good and feel positive and feel hopeful and I think you know a song is sort of like a mantra (…) like it’s the message you’re telling yourself whether it’s intentional or not, or conscious or not"
twenty one pilots did better theories
Can you please react to p!nks new album .... hurts 2B human
Taylor about the creation process of TS7: “It actually wasn’t the first song we created, but as soon as I wrote the chorus, I knew it was something really special. It was difficult to pick a first single for an album that’s so vast, like in the scope of things"
sees snake “oh it’s Taylor Swift!!”
should have tried carly rae jepsen to sing this.
Obviously they haven’t met the Clique. We had to go through the dema page and all that
no haters to represent ppl who hates her ? too bad
Maybe react to some BTS theories, BTS Universe, Songs inspired by books (they've even made me pick up a few books and read) Their theories are always so deep and there's so much to decipher there
That's the guy that signed high Hope's I think
When they were talking about the hints Taylor gave for the album and about how her fans need to becone investigators because they figured out what they mean, I was like" ouh armys can relate, even FBI couldn't figure out bts' story line"😂
Thank you so much for this video

the new girl aiko is so cute!!!!! i love her so much!!! please keep her around 🙏🏼🙏🏼
PLEASE READ: People hating on the song clearly don't know the approach Taylor had~ she has said herself that this song isn't meant to be taken seriously. Its supposed to be fun, cute, and have a positive message. And with a pop song its easier to get something, the positive message, stuck in your head to the point where maybe it'll have a positive impact on the way you see yourself. So many people went after Look What You Made Me Do, and yet as time went on they actually came to like or really love the song. I can bet on it that the same will happen with this one. The song isn't childish... its cute and light-hearted and fun. Taylor released this kind of song now for a reason, and that reason is because there is so much negativity in this world and she wanted to bring some joy. 
Either way Taylor always does this where she releases the most lyrically simplistic song as the lead single because her main focus for the lead single is getting a simple yet very important message across.
Take a shot every time the teens say "like"!
twenty øne piløts and us banditøs laugh at these "CRYPTIC" messages
As an ARMY, we deal with a lot of theories haha. It's cool that Taylor did it too :)

I love all the swifties theorizing and being familiar with every reference in the video and everything it’s so fun to watch
I don't get the hate or the love for the song and video. It's a meh song/video, not the best of her songs, but people like to sensationalize the collaboration and overhype an okay song and video.
ILYGSM!!💕
2:49 yes omg couldn’t agree more why don’t y’all wanna listen to happy songs
This song itself isn’t that great, the music video is nice looking and I’m a big fan of Brendan urie but.. yeah kinda meh.

Generations react to Jimi Hendrix
Ugh I love Taylor Swift so much. I can’t wait for the next release.
Personally, if the song didn't have Brendon Urie it would be a terrible song. Just my opinion.
Next time reactie to the new song of Martin Garrix feat. Macklemore & Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy - Summer Days because that is something you didn’t know you needed
Ooh you should have them react to the Bangtan Universe.  That’s the official fictional storyline that BTS and BigHit have put together through meticulous planning and they’ve released abstract fragments for fans to piece together.  Indeed, the theorizing is so in depth that we refer to those who carefully look through all the content to find clues “FBI ARMYs.”  Seriously, the storyline has been planned out since before BTS debuted in 2013 and we still don’t have the complete story.  It’s not linear either.
So... I'm gonna need a brendon urie only version of the song. Thanks
I was really looking forward to this video. Thank you so much for reacting to this beautiful collaboration😍

Adults/college kids react to Sonic the hedgehog trailer
Let’s be real the song is less than mediocre especially for the talent involved but the video is cute.
Brendon = auto like
I don't care if she worked hard.
The song is still so unfitting and it missed the mark on the key demographic. 
Taylor has a key demographic around 13 to mid twenty year olds (and this sure misses the mark for me as a 20 year old who can still enjoy her old songs) 
And Brendons key demographic is about 17 to early thirties. 

The song sounds fun to a 9-14 year old and with that it clearly misses her and Brendons key demographic with lyrics like: 
"Spelling is fun" 
"There is a me in awesome"
Etc. 

After the album Reputation a lot of people thought that the songs like "reputation" were to dark and edgy 
But liked things that were in between like "delicate" 
But instead of continuing with the sound of "delicate" she once again took her single to a way to extreme corner that's the polar opposite to reputation. 

Her most beloved songs are the once where she dreams, is honest and vulnerable. 
This song and reputation just seem like a flat out Fassade.
I'm a fan of Taylor Swift but I never figure out the clues she releases lol I'm with what's his name my brain doesn't work that way. But I'm always amazed at the really die hard fans that figure it out. Then I be like oh yea duh😑 of course that's brilliant how she did that😆😆I'm gonna always listen to her music and buy albums rather she switch from country to pop and back to country again cause I love her music☺☺

I don’t hate Taylor but her song is ass I’m sorry
Ugh i HATE when people say this song is basic or too poppy. Its still WAY better than the trash ariana grande has come out with: Break up with your gf bc im bored? You like my hair, gee thanks, just bought it. Smh her first album was great and she has a fantastic voice, but this is... just no...

U forgot something!

In taylor’s song endgame, there’s a verse that says: reputation precedes me, which technically that taylor’s reputation come before her, but also keep in mind that her past album was called reputation, and this song is called me. So it can also work as the album reputation came before the song me. Now, and even more mind blowing fact is that if you remember that song where she said the line above is called endgame, now what are the chances that me! is released on the same day that avengers:ENDGAME is???? 

I honestly found that mind blowing

Hi
I get it that it's her song but no one talks about Brendon. Like on twitter I barely saw anything on him. He did help with the song. Also with the cryptic things, Twenty One Pilots does that all the time. I'm not hating because it's just what I see. I like her and her music but this song is just a little to popy. I love the beginning but then it just is no for me. I also love their voices of course. It's weird for me to hear his voice in this kind of song. This song made him happy so I'm happy for them still.

I didn’t even know there were clues. That’s how not involved I am. I guess you’ve got to be apart of the Taylor Swift fan club I am not
Being a part of Taylor Swift's fanbase, you learn to expect a lot of things. I was really excited for this song and honestly? I can't wait to see what the next songs are like. She says her success is because of her fans, but in reality if she never gave us anything to listen to, how were we supposed to follow her? 😄 I've been a huge fan of her and I can safely say I have Me! Playing on repeat💖💙💛💜
12:20 OMG LOUDER 💙💗💙💗💙
wheres kids react?
I try to be open minded, really i do, but i mean its barely even music lol its so shit
Can you do kids react to MatPat's Poppy theory?

That man looks AMAZING for being born in 1936
1936!? He don’t look that old
That dude is 83 and looks 60
Eric gets it. There is a difference between being a "90's Kid" and a "90's Baby".
Damn that dude is 83 years old? That beard makes him look a lot younger
Kids born in 2019 the most popular movie they will react is avengers endgame
The guy born in the 1930’s has lived through it all!
WALKING DOWN THE COUNTRY ROAD
WALKING TO THE COUNTRY STORE
PLAYING IN THE COUNTRY DIRT
Nobody:

Ruby: I Remember playing in the dirt
nobody: 
not a single soul: 
Eric: I COULD GO 20 MILES FOR 5 GUMBALLS!
Biggie died on my birthday and my father remembers it more than my birth.
2:47 
"That was the good old days when songs made sense, and lyrics made even more sense"
HAHAHAHAHA
What a Legend
Walking down the COUNTRY road to the COUNTRY store and playing in the COUNTRY dirt
Melvins 83! Damn. He looks like hes in his 70's
0:18to0:25
New OLD TOWN ROAD lyrics😂😃😂
Eric: "We're in the Golden Age of movies"
Me: eye twitches
When she said, "Ah, the increase in the costs means that we're getting richer!", I sighed and thought, "Man, inflation's going to hit her hard"...
Melvin looks good for a 83 yr old...
I just have to say that the guy who was born in 1936 does not look like he is 82 wow!
I never really notice that people from the 30s are still alive, it amazes me
2:37 1936 .....He doesn't look 83 =) he looks 66-ish
That guy does not look 82 omgggg 😳
1936...he's 83...wow
“I COULD GO 20 MILES FOR 5 GUM BALLS!”😂😂😂
Grunge was big in 1997, Eric???  BB who lied to you?
I'm a normal person, i see biggie, i watch the video
"We live in a very expensive world." Oh honey, try living in Vancouver, Canada
Anyone remember when you can go to college AND have a summer job and still be okay? 

Me neither...
dude born in 36’ looks so good for his age
2:30 when he was singing I was amazed it looked like he was remembering his childhood
"Everyone is getting wealthier as we speak" HAHAHAHA girl, I wish!
Ruby is just a female Cleveland.

Bruh, the dude in 2:40 is 83
I just remember playing in the dirt.
Walking down the country road, to the country store, playing in the country dirt xD
I find this funny for some reason xDD
the elders look really good for their age
The guy born in the 1930s what just like
Back in my day!
Think about how much the guy born in 1936 has been through and seen
Walking down the country road to the country store in the country dirt lollllll
you need to do this with the kids
Wow that man looks so young for 83
I really don’t think I was supposed to tear up when Melvin was quietly singing along to Bing Crosby
“i just remember is playing in the dirt.” 
and this is why i love ruby
No one:
Literally no one:
Not a single soul:
Melvin: good old days when songs made sense and lyrics made even more sense

also 1936: I like bananas because they have no bones
"THATS 5 GUMBALLS! I COULD GO 20 MILES ON FIVE GUMBALLS " oh Eric honey why do you know the exact price of gumballs you goofball
“We're in the golden age of movies.“ Oh, Eric. You've never been so wrong.
Gas was definitely around $4.20 yesterday
"Ice Ice Baby is a Scorpio?"
i love the fifth element so much and oh boiiii i cant believe he doesnt know the movie :( thats saddd
The elders look AMAZING for their age!
Every time I hear Ice Ice Baby I hear Queen's Under Pressure.
THAT MAN IS 82!!WOW
There's no way that Melvin is 83 years old.
The 1936 guy looks so young
what movie theaters are you going to that have 9 dollar tickets?
The Fifth Element is STILL good, Eric.
0:18 I swear that could be the start of a novel. Also, I'm stoned.

Get it....




Because the song was “Pennies From heaven”
1936 good old days just wait 3 years
5th Element does not look like crap compared to today's movies. It is a great movie that still holds up today.
9:03 Well, that just literally upsetted him.
"you could just be DUMB in a HOUSE" Eric you have the best quotes
I thought Melvin was 65-70 years old, not 83 years old!
I was born January 8th same day as Stephen Hawking and Elvis Presley

2:30 Melvin Looks good for being 83!
Today movies are not $9 more like $15
this is more react from the YEAR they were born
When Melvin was quietly singing along it made me feel sad even though it really wasn’t supposed to be sad idk
College kids and adults react to Sonic the hedgehog trailer, PLEASE
Young kid clearly has never looked at homes outside California.
Vanilla Ice ripped off Queen's under pressure...

Ruby's intro was by far the funniest. She was really out here playing in the country dirt. I love her
How is a 30s and 50s movie graphics better than a 90s movie graphics
8:53 how she 30 but dont know what inflation is
I swear I thought I was the only one who thought of this stuff
I want everything to kinda just go back to old days where things were cheaper and everyone just played outside 😪
I feel old. The adults on this channel are born in the nineties.
We are in the golden age of movies? Classic millennial.
Emily was born the same day as me!! 😊
Does Melvin ever smile?
"I COULD GO 20 MILES, FOR 5 GUMBALLS!"
Eric Beckerman, everyone.
Part of this video is a good representation of inflation.
That guy does NOT look 82 😳
Kids react to TXT please 🙏🙏🙏
Protect the elders at ALL COSTS
DID ERIC SAY 2.5 KIDS?? 😭😂😂😂
I am today years old when I found out that Frank Sinatra wasn't the one who originally sang "Pennies From Heaven"

Can you react to TWICE 'FANCY'
Kids react to Elton john.
And WOW, Melvin sir, you look way younger for your age. I would not have guessed 1936 at all.
Please do mortal combat 11 I would love to do it and  I never played mortal combat but I'm a pro at injustice
This was a really good concept, but it would have been better with a few more age ranges. There is a huge gap between 1953 and 1990. Someone born in the 70's would have been a good addition to bridge that gap.
9:18 I relate so much
He doesn’t know The Fifth Element and says it bad....No Way! One of the best movies ever.
Where I live 
Gas: 3.40
Movie ticket: 11.75
Wow.. you can see the house price is definitely an overall average of the states
yall think $318,600 is a lot for a house. boi in Vancouver for a shit house it can be like 1 mil
For ice ice baby they used Queens and David Bowie’s backtrack for under pressure.
I honestly would not have guessed that Melvin was born in the mid 1930's.....mid 1940's sure but not mid 1930's.
The fifth element is still great, its one of my favorite movies, not gonna say top 10 but definitely top 50 for me.
I wouldn't have guessed that Melvin was in his 80s. I would have said 60s.
Melvin was thinking Beverly hill lol
i was born 2 mins after the tsunami hit Indonesia in 2004.

Adam: I was born.
8:17 2.5 kids ok
0:45 My birthday is November 2, 2005
Eric made some really stupid comments in this video.
The elders ones are sweet
I don't think they call this the Golden age of movies. The age of remakes, sequels, and CGI, maybe. But far from "golden".
Wtf $2.49 for gas today? It’s like $4 where I live
The older guy is so sweet! :) 
I wanna see more of him
Steve Irwin was attacked by a sting ray on my birthday
Please react to Stray Kids
2:53 He is like in the ages of 80 or over because my grandmpa was born in 1939
John Lennon was shot two days before my birthday, Yoko Ono held a "vigil to pray for his soul", the day I was born...((
5:17: Luc Besson consciously made The Fifth Element to be a sort of "parody" of superhero and sci-fi films. Like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, but not that obvious at first.
She said, "I just remember playing in the dirt." lmaooo
Apparently in 1998 (my year) Aerosmith released I Dont Wanna Miss A Thing

How do you not know 5th element!! I’m younger than you and I know
Lol $9 for a movie. That's funny. 

My movie tickets range from $15 to $20 each depending on the time of day and type of theater.
That guy born in 1997 was a great predictor. I want him to predict ky future.

Anyone else wondering what happened on their birthday
‘It must mean that everyone is getting wealthier’ girl do you not know what the economy is rn??? You can’t live off the minimum wages they have. Prices of things keep going up but the money we make isn’t. So it’s becoming more difficult to live because you can’t afford it
It is insane that that guy was the age I am now in the 50s. Imagine how life was like for that guy, waking up and going to work etc. compared to how incredibly different it is for me now.
The picture of the house doesn’t have a driveway to get to the garage

For gas prices I guessed  $1.27 for the year I was born, because I remember when it went to $1.37 people were complaining. The price was $1.20. 
As for movie tickets I guessed $4 because I remember going to the movies for your birthday was pretty popular because it was cheap. It was $4.21.

Mmm about that...
eric just brought up a great idea for the next episodes! FBE, can you include the "guess how much it cost to go to college the year you were born? (annual)" I think it would be interesting to see how much the cost goes up from the elders time when probably less than half of them went to college/university until now when mostly everyone my age (I'm a college student) has to go to get a job of some kind.

My dad bought a Brand new 4 bedroom, basement, garage 2 story house for $16,000 (1953) I lived in till I got married in 1970. The good old day's!!!!!!!

Eric and Emily both need a economics class
You have to factor in inflation, durability of a product and development of income when you compare prices over time. For example, in the eighties people earned less money in total but they earned A LOT more money when relating income to prices and inflation. You may make more money than your parents, but that money is worth less, because you pay more to have it in the bank, inflation takes out value of your money every year while prices rise faster than income and products have a shorter lifespan, so you have to spend more money maintaining certain products.

MatPat: [EXCITEDLY] SEVEN CREE XP G2 R5 LEDs!!!!!
I love how everyone was like “uh, is this a flashlight review?” And MatPat is just immediately excited.
Matpat looked like a child in a candy store watching the flashlight video






And in the car video
Matpat should collaborate with the flashlight guy😂
All of these videos will appear in your recommendations after 6 years
MatPat getting excited over a flashlight just made my day 100% better
The flashlight man must be protected at all costs
"It doesnt help that it was filmed on a potato..." 
-MatPat 2019  





I DIED 😂😂😂😂
MatPat's interest in the flashlight review is amazing
imagine the uploaders waking up to suddenly find 10 000 views
😂 Mat Pat is the only one who was invested in the flashlight vid.
Ugh my biggest fear is to have one of my videos pop up on stuff like this.
Mat Pat getting exited about a flashlight review is literally one of the most nerdiest things he has ever done I love him lol
Those videos have zero views but this video have 1 million views soo technically those videos have over 1 million views😂😂
The light one was lowkey good like what if you was out camping and needed a good flashlight but didn’t know which one to chose well there you go George got the answers for you
I hope flashlight guy becomes famous ❤
Matt got so interested with the flashlight review 😂😂😂
flashlight guy is so pure
Everyone else: this deserves more views
MatPat: doesn’t help it was filmed on a potato
MatPat geeking out over the flashlight review was the highlight of my day
I actually bought that flashlight after watching this video
5:00 that poor guy went through all the trouble to film, research, review, and edit that video. Only to get zero views
Mat pat was the only one who was actually invested in the flashlight video XD
only one of them was the first person to see the video
Most people in this video: “I guess it’s okay, can see why it has no views”

MatPat: WOW!
The Wikipedia video is for people who are blind and don't have screen readers! You can look up the audio of a Wikipedia article
So many creators are just gonna be confused as to why they've gone from 0 to shitloads, and then they'll look at the comment section and realise
Love how Mat was genuinely intrigued to the flashlight review 😂
I love how Matpat is so excited about the flashlight and car😁
watching matpat get happy over a review on a flashlight makes me happy
I love how Matt was so happy for the flashlight!
These videos are gonna end up with a  lot of views now
That means the creators of those videos never watched them theselves.

Beacause I didnt
The first guy should have a ton of views like 🤩🔥
doesn't help that it was filmed on a potato -matpat
That flashlight guy was more entertaining than jake paul
Why was matpat so over excited about the flashlight?
Wouldn't it have more then 0 views because of all the youtubers watching it
MatPat being excited about that flashlight brings light to my life
I like how in the flashlight video everyone is confused but saying they're learning and then there's just Matt fascinated with this
MatPat lowkey promoting his merch by wearing his own jacket
if they all watch it at different times, the videos technically have views already 🤷‍♀️
the flashlight video was awesome, I'm not kidding I really liked it
first video: guy playing like 10 instruments at once WELL, zero views
us: watching youtube videos of people watching youtube videos, almost 2m views

EDIT: acquerne
MatPat enjoyed the flashlight review way too much
I watched 27 and I’m unimpressed…….    




…ಠ_ಠ
The flashlight review was nice and genuine. Thanks Charles.
The Mat has been amused
Only one of these people get to be the first
wow, I just went and looked, and now all of those vids have an upwards of 10,000 views! I guess FBE really helped them out!!
these no-view videos make me feel like i fell asleep on my grandmas couch with the TV on and woke up at 3 am to see this on the screen
It’s just a theory a flashlight theory
The flashlight one was cool... So sweet that he's so passionate about it.
Wait, wouldn't the first view of these videos be the first YouTuber they filmed first🤔 

BUT ITS JUST A THEORY, A FBE THEORY
How can they all be the first hmmm?🤔🤔
Wait, they all watched the same videos? So, who was the actual first person who saw it?
Personally, I like Matpat's reactions the best, as he kinda acts sarcastically excited, but then is actually a little intrigued.


Also, that did look like a pretty darn good flashlight.
3:46 Matpat: finally a flashligth my secret pasion !! 😂
I can’t tell if matpat is being sarcastic or not
the first time someone can actually call themselves “first”.
They can't all be the first to watch the same video
MatPat. The only person to actually understand and enjoy
... The flashlight video... 🤦‍♂️
Matpat being excited about the flashlight is my last brain cell at 2 a.m.
I love that mat pat is exited about the flashlight
But if all of them watch the same video, then it would have more than zero views
That flashlight one was in my recommended a week ago
Matpat really enjoyed that flashlight review huh.
Matpat really loves flashlight
Everyone: ...




Matpat: WOAHHHH LOOK AT THIS FLASHLIGHT. Omg this is 10/10!!!
Matpat is too excited to see the flashlight review

2:04. “Doesn’t help that it was filmed on a potato”
Website's down. Their little server probably blew up from all the hits.
WHY ARE THESE COMMENTS JUST TODAY
💕Matpat’s enthusiasm is what we all need in life💕
No one:
Literally no one:
MatPat about to watch a flashlight review: gasping while saying it Yes!
I love how mat pat Acts Like he knows what he's talking about 😂
The flash light one is great, the person who made the video did a great review and to see it go unrecognized makes me sad
The guy dangmattsmith was so negative about the flashlight video.. let the guy have his passion for flashlights tf
I'm so fricking happy that my friend, India's very own One Man Band Gladson Peter is here! He's currently touring China I think and I request y'all to go check him out he's so underrated and is one of the best Musicians ever!

Seeing MatPat geek out over a flashlight was adorable😂😂
wow i didn't realize my own videos could end up on this react channel
3:47 Oh MatPat, the internets most adorable and authentic nerd
imagine having a famous youtuber be the first person to watch your video
Mat Pat: Doesn’t help that it was filmed on a potato
Pewdiepie leaves the chat
"Doesn't help that it was filmed on a potato"..... HAVE YOU SEEN PEWDIEPIE, MATPAT?!?
1:12 That’s the most toxic I’ve ever seen Rosanna lol
Mattpat would be like
Give me anyvid and I will find a way to enjoy watching it Optimism
gets 1million views
It scares me how much Matt was into the flashlight one
I love how MatPat was the only one who "enjoyed" the flashlight review.
Went and viewed and liked that first vid 🤩🔥♥️
Technically, only one of them was the first to watch each of those videos and I feel lied to.
Could you imagine who pewdiepies FIRST view on his FIRST video was?
matpat geeking out about the flashlight is my new favourite thing
That flashlight was really good tho!!
Wait technically they aren't the first to watch it because they each gave it a view...
Matpat:And hes recording on a potato..

Me:So pewdipie is used to record with a seed.
Some of my videos better be in this
I love how MatPat was so interested in that flashlight.
Matt:who plays this instrument?
Pinkie pie:ME!?!?
I expected one of my videos to be there lol
I sense that matpat will buy the flashlight and possibly make a flashlight theory
I wonder if anyone will ever read this comment
"Getting that first view (...) that can mean a lot to a small creator"
I felt that :)
I kinda want that flashlight now 0_0 Nvm, it's around $100
doesnt help that it was filmed on a potato


ok
Anyone else love the flashlight reviewer guy?
When flashlight guy meets the criteria of 'MATPAT'
Can’t really tell when matpat is exaggerating or just being a nerd

1:04 even Thanos doing videos reaction
Matt Patt bought that flashlight in the end
Now those videos have thousands of views
Matt's reaction over a flashlight and 2019 Acura was great! Lol
And now all those videos have thousands of views
Just so you know, the song in the Pepa video is not Spanish, but Greek :P
Matt: it doesn’t help that it was filmed on a potato.

We aren’t all rich Matt

1:42 "He is a one man band!"

...Of course he is? That's kind of where the term came from. Those things have been around for a while, you know.
Is it just me or. Well......only one of the reactors for today are the first to watch.................because otherwise they aren't first, other people, the other reactors, have seen it...........................this can't just be me thinking this......can it?! 🤨
I would buy that flashlight
Wait a minute if they all watched the videos at once then only one of them was the first to view
Funny thing is watch these videos start getting plenty of views due to this upload
actually now it won't be 0 views so
You’ll be first! Shows video to everyone...
1:00 “It’s so rare to find a video with literally 0 views.” Me: Uploaded Minecraft videos in 2011. 8 years later goes back to old videos 0 views. 😂
0:10 DAMN they even brought a monkey to react this time
11:07 BLUE SHIRT KID!!!!

Wait if they're all watching the same videos...who really watched it first?
Ποιος ακουσε το ελληνικο τραγουδι στο βιντεο με την πεπα?😂

Dammit MatPat got excited about a flashlight review

But did they like and comment on the videos? 👀👀👀
Thought i would of found one of my videos here lol🤣
2:54 so no one is gonna talk about the Greek song? 





Ok.
When you realize that only one of them was the actual first person to watch that video. And the fact that FBE had them planned out...
Matpat is literally the only person I know that can be entertained by a flashlight review  😂
technically all of these vids have 2mil views cuz of the people who watched this video
Oh mah god, what- did I just click on? There's two minutes and 35 seconds of this??

YES THE WORLD NEEDS MORE FLASHLIGHT REVIEWS 😂😂😂
Matt pat was very exited
This was really inspiring and uplifting for a small channel like mine. I felt goosebumps hearing all the youtubers talk about their experiences with their first views. This was a cool video!
Please react to Taylor Swift and Brendon Urie's new single

Wich one of those youtuber wete accualy the first one to watch the vids out of them????!!!!
mat being enthusiastic about flashlights is my aesthetic
I love somethingelseyt
Rose are red
Violets aren’t blue
Violets are purple 
That part is true
Some of my vids have 1 view but I'm the one who watched it
Ok, flashlights are actually a big thing on the internet. There are whole forums and websites dedicated to reviewing them and batteries. Vaping devices use the same type of batteries so we often turn to that stuff to see what batteries are good or not. My channel has like 11 videos and haven't put one up in over 3 years. Most are like 20-80 views. One was a joke pretending I put a jet engine on my scooter, that one has 119 views. I made one about why you cough when you vape and that thing has like 22K views! I didn't know that until just now when I looked lol.
Bruh so this is why my main channel is getting so much attention all of a sudden?
“You will be the first person to see this video”
shows everyone viewing it
After one person watches it, it doesn’t have one view anymore
I thought they're gonna react to my vid lol
But who was TRULY first? There no way they ALL were.
doesn't help that it was filmed by a pootato
No one:

MatPat: sees flashlight being used Is this the new one? Oohohoo
I was kinda hopeing one of the videos was going to get dark
9:48 that's the process of the taming of a wild horse. You're welcome.
Lol all those videos have thousands of views now
They should watch me....
Everyone except matpat: oh it’s a flashlight review 
Matpat:WOAAAH 2500 LUMENS THIS IS A 10/10 VIDEO
Wow, now matpat knows what car AND what flashlight to buy!

To like my own comment
Im so happy :')
When this vid was uploaded 1 second ago it had 0 views...
Well i guess we can say these videos that were in the video now have 2,000,000+ views
matpat’s reaction to the flashlight had me dying 😂😂
How do they all have “first view” if they all saw it separately?
Well now they have at least one view
This is such a wholesome episode.❤
Matpat is bringing me so much joy with his reactions 😁
Everyone saw this though, at different times, you lied to them
This could be my moment.
They can’t be the first people to watch it if there was multiple people
MatPat: hears “flashlight review” gets excited
Dev: its a broken flashlight review
MatPat:my dreams of being bright have gotten dim 


This is what i imagine happening with him bc he just so excited about the flashlight review i love it lmao
I have a video right now on my channel that has absolutely no views. It's really not that hard to imagine people never watching a video.
How are they the first if they are all watching it tho....
Not surprised that a Roblox vid appeared
I wonder if any of the people that uploaded these videos watch this channel
I have 0 views... why don't be my first .. :)
I could see Rosanna as a grandma so much😂
Support that guy who did the flashlight.

EDIT: That Akiyama Yukari sugoi bar
Now they don't have 0 views.
How can everyone be the first watching a video if they all watched the same video?

Video: Suck it
Adam: It’s so wholesome ☺️

How could it be zero views if they are all reacting to the same vidoes after each other? 🤔🤔🤔
Well technically it’s one view, people watch videos with one view
"Who invented this instrument?" My first thought was Bert from Mary Poppins. :)
I always find videos with no views😂
I am living for the flashlight review
Only MatPat would enjoy the flashlight video.
Im gonna go to all of these videos and give them one more view. Just for their effort
MatPat is epic.
My video was in that site 😭
They're not Zero View videos anymore

Tiffany Alvord?! My og YouTube crush?!?!
for real i would watch flash light reviews.
No Videos with 0 Views left.
FBE broke that webside.
and now they have 1000 views
Who else came here to see if any of their videos were there!??? 😂😂😂
I know a youtube channle with no views
I can't believe that peppa pig one has no views
React to blow minding facts of the phillippines???
Edit: Its on youtube btw you don't need to research more
i dont get this,if one person already watched the video,then they’ve become the first one while the other people that are watching the same thing are going to be the second,third,etc....
If they are all watching the same video then only one of them was the first view
What about my videos ): Cleary they didnt check me out!
"Is that John Cina"
6:17 The moment Ro realised... she picked the wrong video
Becca and Adam are the only reasons I need to watch react videos.
They lied...only one of them was the first one to see it first
But if you show multiple people the same video they aren't the first to watch it
8:59 man I delayed like 10 seconds to notice that is in portuguese (it's my native language, so I was understanding but I didn't notice). 😱😅
Pls let the teens react to attack on titan movie trailer!!!

How is it 0 views when they're all watching the same video.
MatPat is such a dork
Well they have views now.
"Doesn't help that it was filmed on a potato" -Matpat 2019

5:54 proposing to a crazy girl.
How can they all be the first viewer if they all watch it at different times.
MatPat with that Game Theory merch
WHO TF IS PEPPA THE PIG
F I R S T
The people who finally got those views are either super happy or extremely disappointed it took this long on such a video streaming website
If your videos are being shown in this video, congratulations on your first view coming on such a massive platform.  And honestly, I thought the flashlight review was surprisingly insightful.
so first person but alot of people watch vid
I love how Matt just got excited about a flashlight.
Well, fbe showed the 0 views videos to like 10 people, so actually it was only 0 views for only one of them, and the rest have seen a video with at least 1 view, i wanted to see that in the comments so bad lol
Ελληνας κάνεις;;;
When you kinda hoped your video was in this video for some channel promo 😂😂😂
2 animators on this! Love rebecca!
2:54 That's Greek, not Spanish
2:03 Doesn't Help It Was Filmed On A POTATO!

speaking of reviews, check out the barnard bathroom reviews. quality reading and statistics. some bathrooms have a better poopability rating than others. 
yes it's a legit website (not malicious). you'll thank me later
They're literally all memes waiting to happen
I met Jason Y Lee at a summer camp in August 2018. He came and took a video with us
“It doesn’t help that it was filmed on a potato” I’m dead 😂😂
This video is instantly outdated because everyone’s gonna search up these videos
2:55 Greek music omg😂
I'm surprised my videos weren't on there, I barely get any views. Some of my videos are good, but lol. Alas
Aqua man drowns in endgame
I have that one video with no views. It's part of a small series.. Of me trying to make a point and click game.
Sometimes the view of the creator counts and sometimes it doesn't btw. 
YouTube is weird.
"It doesn't help that it was filmed on a potato"
Lol when people watch my videos.
Let’s just say matpat is just incredible.
The song was Greek I looked up and saw it
I'm tweeting the links to all of these
I wonder how many of these 0 views videos are reposts from random people.
Bruh so they didn’t even care to watch their own video? Lol
Jason from jubilee!!!
MATPAT IS SO INTO THAT FLASHLIGHT REVIEW.... IM DED
2:55 🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
No lie, I actually enjoyed the flashlight video
I am surprised my vids ain't in this vid
Please do a react to cat & dog by txt
I already know one of these will go viral
These videos have thousands of views, and making four people watch a video makes the video have 4 views
I streamed myself playing Psychonauts so my girlfriend could watch me play, and for over a year I legit had NO IDEA that my PS4 auto uploaded the stream to my YouTube channel. 

It had 30 views when I noticed it. I thought that was kinda cool.
React to my videos then.
1:00 MatPat isn't MatthewPatrick13, he's Game Theory/Film Theory
That peppa pig video was honestly gold
The first video... Isnt that "Amazing Grace " ?
Ah... so this is where those commenters we see everywhere gets its source.
TXT cat and Dog please :>
6:10 - 6:49 is the funniest thing ever 😂
seriously, the peppa pig one doesn't have any views?  people watch those all the time
These guys are really sad
"Oh my gosh is happening ahhhh"

Teens/Adults/Youtubers react to "Timelapse of the Future"
Can u do a MOMS REACT to kids bad answers on test scores please
I half expected to see some of my videos. Still sitting at zero, though.
The only fbe video i could be in 😐
Why is everyone commenting rn? Anyways...Have a good day
What’s ironic is that this video will probably get more views alone than any of these individual vids in the rest of the existence of the internet.
No lie that flashlight video was pretty dope....... I’d use the new one he was showing off for sure!
Dang, I thought they'd found my channel before the video started 😅
Tiffany looks like Amy Adams
Good thing I privated my vids a while back
who else actually went and searched this videos? or is it just me? 
okay then 🙂💔
5:11 That's my oldest brother! He loves to carry flashlights since he likes to work with cars.

1:00 Literally my entire alt account
Wow time to put my let's plays on the sites to get featured
"Doesn't help that they filmed it on a POTATO" 😂😂😂😂
Farting compilation they have to
It makes me happy to see MatPat so legitimately excited about the flashlight review while everyone else was kinda bored or only kinda interested because the person was passionate about the flashlight review. 😊😊

Also the first one man show was "AMAZING" (wink wink). Pun kind of intended.
You should do more WTF did I just watch

SomeThingElseYT is my favorite music artist!
3:01 παντεληδης αξία 🇬🇷

Now this really speaks to me since I literally started YouTube 2 weeks ago....Hearing how these guys got to the top is really inspiring me to do better
Love the video FBE!
I kinda want to get that flashlight now for my keychain.
Matpat is my soul animal
Well if Rosanna watched it first wouldn’t the other youtuber be the second or third or fourth....
2:04 “doesn’t help that it was filmed on a potato” 

Love it
MatPat!
Make them react to Faby Dumpling
You should make a video about old people reacting to slang or memes without any explanation and then explain it to them.
Yo y'all got John cena and Billie eilish on this vid, great
Rebecca is wearing her merch
Anyone esle thought of why dont we when rosanna said (1)"man band"
This video actually inspired me to not give up on YouTube thanks fbe and everyone who was in this video😁
Omg this is happening
5:54 omg, it's happening, AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
That first video looks like something you'd see down in New Orleans on Bourbon Street.
That guy with the guitar suit is actually deserving of a ton of views

Can u make one with Matpat and other people that have their own theories and testing if they remember which was which??????
Surprised there are videos with almost no views or subscribers?  Welcome to my youtube channel.
The guy with the flashlight reminds me of my Science teacher in 8th grade.  He's really passionate about rocks and I feel bad bc a lot of the kids make fun of him.
Okay but the flashlight video guy reminds me of Ron Swanson...
Me before watching the video: Omg are they gonna watch one of my videos!

Me after: i’M oK. ‘cries inside’
Why are not my videos here?
Mat pat with the new merch
Of course MatPat is the only one excited about the flashlight.
Theory

Everything equals four! (Inspired by Tik tok)

Starbucks = 9 letters = 9 has four letters!
FBE = 3 letters = 3 has 5 letters = 5 has 4 letters!
REACT = 5 letters = 4 letters!
Jewelzer plays = 13 letters = 8 letters = 5 letters = 4 letters


POOF
Literally nobody:


Not a single soul: 


Not even a single creature:



Matpat:I enjoy flashlight reviews and jake Paul should take notes
Me watching matpats vids 6:14

Rosanna Pansino reminds me so much of one of my favorite comics from back in the day Judy Tenuta and I'm saying this as an absolute complement.

Can you guys have YouTubers react to fatalities from mortal kombat 11 plz
I just randomly found a video with no views and it’s a 2 second video with no audio about and it’s the Joker from the Joker movie dancing.
Im thinking youtube is drunk again, because maybe that 0 views arent actually 0 views
Imagine the irony if they got 0 views on this
Idk if Matpat's reaction is wholesome or sarcastic. Because it's a little bit exaggerated. But since it's MatPat... I'll go with wholesome.
When you get promoted...
Imagine THIS video having 0 views
so many of my favorite youtubers on this one!

You should make a video about old people reacting to slang or memes without any explanation and then explain it to them.

I only like the vid if Adam is there and dangmattsmith
Tiffany alvord❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
1:03 I felt exactly the same way about it, any video of mine needs a -1 on the view count because I always check I thought everyone checked so when he said it all shocked that was me too otherwise I could totally have popped up on this site they were talking about in the beginning. I need to find time and motivation to record again.
Now I can spam “FIRSTTTT!!!!!!!!” On 50 different videos everyday :D
Dangmattsmith: I know why this one has zero views
Matpat: THEY MADE A NEW ONE?!?!?!
I need the rainbow jacket
All ya'll saying "I can tell why this has 0 views" No you can't because you have to watch it to know why meaning you gave it a view. AND all the vids with 0 views have terrible titles which is why it has 0 views.
That first video was good ..and have seen coldplay ...carry like that instruments on their mv the sky full of star

0:16 OH MY GOD. THAT'S THE CEO OF JUBILEE. I JUST WATCHED A VIDEO OF HIM IN "DO ALL JUBILEE EMPLOYEES THINK THE SAME"
At 8:44 I thought it was written in Russian or sm and then when the woman started talking and I realized it was actually portuguese (I'm Brazilian)
Lawrence is the man
So what does darkness look like... 








hmmm
Wait how do you find these 0 view videos without adding a view?
You wanna find a video with no views?


Look at my channel! :)
Funhaus is the only reason I'm here :)
I clicked on the video cuz I have no views

Michelle is so painfully beautiful.
They are all watching the same video so aren’t really first one

Ssooooo who was the FIRST person to watch this video?
When you aren't in this video because you just got 2 views

*insert dj khaled suffering from success meme
I need a hug
If they are all watching it then it's not the first person really is it
First? No? Okay.
Well didn't expect to see Funhaus here
I was actually into that flashlight review. Like how on earth can you actually fit 2500 lumens in that tiny thing?!
Do willdoesgames
I never knew that there was website for videos with zero views out there. It’s crazy honestly!
Somethingelseyt: I love when reviewers test the item
Me: umm don’t they always?
the thing is: If someone watches the video, how is the next youtuber watching it the first one?
Or are they watching simultaneously?
How does that first video not have views. That was crazy cool
all of them are the first view? something is wrong in here
Dawm im not on it
Put the odd1sout in
Rebeca is beautiful
"it's so rare to find a video with no views"

So who really the first person to watch these videos tho?
It's not very hard to be the first person my channel mate 😂😂
I wish I was on this
1:08 isn’t that the girl from A.P. Bio?
Watch one of my videos no veiws
StumbleUpon was a good service.
Idk why, but Matpat and the Flashlight video almost made me choke on my tea because it made me laugh. XD
small creator lol can relate
first
I hate that people dont watch vids with no views. I want subs
4:39 see Konosuba
I mean I at least have two views a day because my friends watch them.....

AYY DANGMATTSMITH
Wow I only watched as I thought I might be one with no likes lol 😱😂🎬
thanks for this video. it s not the viewer s fault (and their willingness to give no view videos a shot is a great hope for smalltubers like myself) but its that larger than life algorythm that literally does crush creations out of sight forever for lack of links, easy taglines and appealing thumbnails. let s all keep creating.
Fiuh i thought my video on this
9:57 she so cuteee
Next video: Liking comments with no likes 
(See what I did there?)
I had a channel and uploaded like 5 videos that didn't get a single view between all of them
The person who was talking sound like mr.blah blah blah from somethingElseYT
The flashlight review has comments from 2 years ago. Highly doubt you were the first ones to see it.
Lawrence really said 🌛🗿
OF COURSE Matpat is the one to enjoy the flashlight video 😂
First
pls let my videos hit 1000 views
My name is jubilee
LUCKY
Now can they react to comments with ZERO LIKES? 




like this
Roses are red
ketchups are too
I GOT A LIKE!!!
But why is it blue?
finally someone else who is amused by flashlights. whenever the power is off i act like im in some horror game walking slowly
I kinda want that flashlight now 0_0
Nvm, it's around $100

Why are people commenting seconds ago
I Love How Mat Is Pretending To Love The Videos.
As a security guard I appreciate good flash light reviews. It's like the tool for securing perimeters at night. That's why we're kinda awkwardly fetishisty about it.
Didn’t they all basically react so only one of them was really the first one to watch
What happened to matt shea

Matt: it’s good but it doesn’t help that it was filmed on a potato!

Me: 🤣🤣🤣 ha yea it doesn’t!
How can it be 0 views if multiple people watch it ????
I have zero views videos, anybody wanna watch them? 😀
I love it when MatPat nerds out 😃😂
6:22 ME WHEN I OPEN UP MY HOMEWORK.
That man in the first video is mad talented, as that girl said he's a one man band
0 views but showed it to multiple people
They finally reacted to my channel!
Matpat was happy with the 🔦 review! 😂
These videos don't have zero views they have a couple because of these people.
I'm scared of everyone
YouTube algorithm should recommend me more of these types of content
Now tell me, FBE; who was the first person to watch THIS video?

Also, the only first view on these videos is the FIRST youtuber who watches them..
5:55 aaaahhh
Fortnite video: suck it

Adam: ha already off to a great start!
So homered to be the 1,513,644th viewer
Matpat reacts to fnaf theories with other fnaf player youtubers plz like thus to bring it to the light
Now i wish some of my videos had 0 views :(
You should definitely do more videos like this the instrumental guy has 10K views awww
Hey 7.1k sqaud
Seriously? A Pepe Pig + John Cena meme with 0 views. 

I dont believe it.

Edit: Peppa Pig. Not Pepe Pig. God I hope that isn't a thing....
How did multiple people watch the same video with no views
Did anyone else check on the videos they watched just to see how many views it has now?
wonders why it’s getting comments every couple seconds
Oooh, it’s on #34 trending, okay
I didn't expect Roblox to be there
How many of my vids are on that website
Legit all the comments are small YouTubers trying to get noticed



I am one of them, hello
Now these vids have 1.5 m views lol
But the first youtuber who reacted to the video then it doesn't have 0 views anymore, which means the second youtuber who watches it won't be the first one to see it.....
1:42 Brendon Urie be like
I love how ECSTATIC matpat was to see those flashlights
Michelle- Albedo

Matpat- Ben 10
I have a video with no views,all of the views are from me
im glad matpat liked the flashlight one, it made me happy for some reason lol
2:57 ahhahaahah it’s a Greek song
imagine someone’s first youtube view was from a famous youtuber
Before I went to school which was 9 hours ago I was going to look this up
These are great lol
When you put the videos in the description but don't have them in order :/
I dont even know ANY of these YouTubers lmao
MatPat sounds really exited over that fleshlight
So many recent comments
Question. How could they ALL be the first viewer? If you don't get it let me explain. If Matt watched it first, and he was told HE was the first viewer. Then, Ro watched the SAME video and was told SHE was the first view this video wouldn't make since. If I'm just over thinking this then I'm sorry.
But wait there telling them that they are all the 1st personal watch that video and they're all watching the same video?
now these videos have over 1.4 million views
2:18 how does this not have views?
Us all just hoping our vids are on there
6:16 Intrigued
6:19 Confused
6:23 Insert windows shut down music
3:44 he sounds like hank hill talking about propane. "Flash lights and flash light accessories"
I came here hoping my videos would be on here
This is definitely not a video with 0 views. Congrats on the #34 trending!
How’d you get matpat Rebecca, Adam and dangmatsmith
Let’s Go Animators! And MatPat!
Seeing this I thought you were going to react to my yt channel ;(

react to IM ft Elhae — Horizon pLEASE
try not to get bored!!! PLEASE
Alright, shut it down, we've reached peak unoriginality.
So do they just leave the tab open...cause only one can be first. Also they would need to preview the video too
That’s rare I have 0 views
5:57 she sounds like marge simpson when she screams
Am I the only one who doesn’t know who any of these people are except mat 😂😂
lmao why is this on trending
the video at 8:13 now has 27,000 views
This was definitely a cool concept
Now they have 1.3 million viewers

Jubilee is one of the best channels in YT. Need more recognition and appreciation.
If they all watched it at different times how are all of them the first view
Oh my god Matt is sooo me
The amount of people that didn't watch the intro and then proceeded to complain about something that the intro explained physically hurts me.
ΑΥΤΟ ΜΕ ΤΗΝ ΠΕΠΑ ΕΙΧΕ ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΟ ΤΡΑΓΟΥΔΙ ΚΛΑΙΟ

Andrew, post him!!! 🏀
My 25th birthday was the day of the Haiti earthquake, sad sad day. I did not make any videos tho.
First of all because of the algorithm
I got on these videos and they had thousands of views but I’m guessing everyone who watched this went to those video
I think I have one video on my "channel" and it's litterly just my fluffy cat rolling around the dirt.
The voice of the of the Flash Light Review Guy sounds like Mr. Plinkett

That Marshmello hammer tho.
3:00 He has my shirt

Lol matpat in the flashlight review
It's not rare, all my videos got 0 views.
Dangmattsmith and SomethingElseYt picked the best videos to watch, Roblox and a kid going to report someone on fortnite
Oh hey, Jason from Jubilee!
3:50 "Well, i know why this one doesn't have any views" i think the guy who commented that was pretty rude about the flashlight video, people create content on things they want to do, that man probably really likes to talk about flashlights and knows a lot about it, big yikes.
Would love to see Benny and Rafi and the cast of My Music React to the first episodes of My Music. It's a great classic YT series!
Um vídeo em PT nem acredito hahahahah

“You’re the first person to view this video!” *proceeds to show them all the same video
Waittt....




If all of them whached it...
They wouldn’t all be the first veiw...
They don’t have zero views anymore
If I didn’t already know that MatPat was a huge frickin nerd, him geeking out about the number of LEDs in a flashlight for a flashlight review seals the deal

How does that video have no views for everyone when they watch it at different times....
Im a part of that "untapped marcket"
And until people start saying "FIRST!!!1!!" In every video the first person watches...
How many people clicked this wondering if one of their old videos was in it
It didn't help that I was filmed on a potato...
The first one can be Brendon Urie 😂😂. He is a one man band.
I’ve been stuck on “Doft Punk” for too long

You guys should react to daily dose of Internet he’s a real humble and nice guy and his videos are short and simple and he always remind you that the Internet is not as bad as people perceive it to be.
This zero view videos is now have a lot more views than my video views
I think videos that get zero views probably happens because they give it a weird name and/or don’t put any tags on it. So it doesn’t show up in any searches.
When they have zero views but FBE publish this and it get mucher
I know non of these youtubers except dangmattsmith
The first guys is better then Heath Slater

i had a feeling that some random kid's roblox video would be here
at 9:57 and onwards basically the guy is lunging his PONY not little horse xD and he is just trotting him around probably to either warm his muscles up or to give him a bit of a workout. Hope this helped to anyone who was wondering!

If you do react to it us ARMYs would be very grateful. Thank you!!

You dot DangMattSmith in it woah he’s got a run of subs
everyone is confused about how they got the same videos when they have "zero views". guys they explained it in the beginning. for the sake of the video they have to show the same videos but when they were searching for the videos it had zero views.
