Tai Lopez might say join the SMMA class, and being a student I have to agree. Not finished with it yet but what I’ve been through so far is very useful
Well she didn't catch you outside so you had to 


Wait out here a long perilotically time
Love you Faze!!

Thank you for Inspiring us!!

This is Zacchary (we call him Biggy) is your biggest fan, he’s a subscriber, and he watches all your videos and your brothers!  ‬
All he does is watch your guys videos and talks about them. 
‪Please x 1000 shout him out. It would mean the world to him. He always talks about meeting you and your brother. ‬You and your brother inspire him to want to play basketball and make a YouTube channel. 
Thank you 😊

You and Mr beast should do a collab of buying a lot of something then donating it to a homeless shelter

PS Maya
i think the total is gonna be 500-600 dollars just because it is 1.00, 2.00,3.00 stuff so idk
I knew you that everything was more than 99 cents
this video hurts to watch after seeing mr. beasts video 😂
Damn Mr Beast went off buddy
Faze rug : who are you



Mr beast : you but better
日本人居る？
I think the $0.99 store is everything ends in .99 like 0.99, 1.99, 2.99, etc.
FaZe Rug:Buying one of each item in the whole store!

Mr.Beast:Buying every single item in the store until it's completely empty
btw you missed multiple after multiple items so you didn't buy every.
Who came here from mr beast
Faze rug:Buys every item in 99cent store
Mr.Beast:hold my beer
Hey Faze rug thats from mr beast channel and you dint shout him out
love you brain 
love you what you doing. 
keep it up bro
Faze Rug- “Buying 1 of every item from the $.99 store

Mr. Beast- “Hold my bank account”
Mr. Beast has a more longer and more expensive recite
Really love your videos Rug! ❤️ Inspired me alot! 

How many are watching everyday?!
👇🏻👇🏽👇🏾
i just love how you always give to others 😊🖒
You should’ve went to dollar tree everything is only $1
Know what I like about you?....that you donate to shelters😇 thank you for all you do
He got one-upper by Mr.Beast 😂
We can’t even afford to buy 20 things with our money combined 😂
Omg. We need those purple carts here in NZ 😭
Funny how he looked at his rosy without a watch on 🤣 lmfao
when he was doing his intro i felt bad for him because he was thinking everything was 99 cent
Mr. BEast did the SAME exact thing... but he bought EVERYTHING  lol
You remind me of x I like the way no matter how much people bring you down you always show kindness and more than words can even say love you💞💞💞
THIS.... THIS IS WHY I LOVE YOU BRIAN. YOU INSPIRE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD AND I RESPECT THAT I SERIOUSLY LOVE YOU ETERNALLY.💛
basically you're broke version of Mr beast
Rug buy one one every thing 

Mr.Beast buy the hole store
When you try to make it on trending by copping mr beast but ur video is not as good
Even thoe it was not 99cemts store you still bought the stuff for the homeless people 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏god bless you
FazeRug did it as a good deed, not battling on who got the longest receipt.
Mr. beast make you looked poor in his video
I think it is going to be about around 1000 to 2500
But Mr beast took it to the next level
That was alot of stuff but I don’t think that that was EVERYTHING.
FaZe Rug:buying one of everything
Mr.beast:buying everything
“Wait, not every item is 99 cents in here!?”

Ikr, when I found that out I was like “THATS COMPLETE BULL, WHY CALL IT THE 99 CENTS STORE THEN!?”
Mrbeast just topped this by 100
Mr. Beast showed u up tbh! lmao. He even bought for random customers full carts, and continued to purchase items after they restocked!
Make this blue if u love Faze rug 
👇I’m gifting to subs 🌹🌹💕💓
Can you please record when u bring more
OMG !Lol!!  It use to be, but it changed a few years ago!! Almost everything is still 99cent, but there is a few items that cost more.
Ive been waiting for this video mt entire life. Literally.
Omg thats amazing 😉 Rug has a beautiful hart he’s blessed 💕💙💚💛🧡❤️
I really miss escondido california. Thanks for the vlogs, reminds me of my 🇺🇸 days. I'm a fan from the Philippines.

FaZe Rug: Buying one of everything at the store
Mr beast : Buying everything at the store

Rug:Let’s by one of everything 
Beast: let’s by the entire store
Mr. Beast: laughs
I can’t believe that they didn’t know that all items in the 99 cents store is more than 99 cents.
Wow
But it was so nice what they did
$1879 my guess :)
Make a video of you taking it to the homeless shelter
Mr beast bought all the items in a store and also gave it to the homless
That poor cashier tho.. +1 respect 😔😔
Definitely didn’t buy everything but good deed
Who else here after watching Mr.Beast video 🤣
Faze rug: Buying everything from the 99 cents store. 




MrBeast: Hold my random pepsi I found in one of the isles while buying everything from a huge store.
Wow this where YouTube get you ❣️
7:47 I don't know how to spell her name but I think it is like Kaitlyn or something
Rug: This is the longest receipt I’ve ever seen

Like have you ever been to CVS
Mr.Beast Bought Everything In The Store
I thought everything from the 99 cent store was a dollar also
Mr beast: hold my money
Awesome video, I love this!💯🙏
I can tell that u usually don’t do groceries since u put the bread on the bottom 😂
The discount Mr. Beast
If you are looking for a shopping challenge. Try and buy out the whole store
Aww this is aswome !god bless you!💛🙏
Had to sub after watching this
Damn bro you a1 I almost cried lol 😂 positive vibes GOD BLESS YOU
Bro who would even dislike the video if u did u r insane like if u agree
I think he watches mrbeast (I think that's how you spell his channel name/title)
Why you guys being rude. He helped but mr beast helped also
Rug I do stuff like this because I watch your videos please dm at Richard Carmody on ig
Mr beast buy everything from walmart it was $70,000
WOAH, YOU HAVE 4 FULL CARTS TO DONATE, GUESS WHAT, MR. BEAST (BETTER THAN YOU) GOT WAYYY MORE CARTS TO DONATE
i really hope they both go to that event together ❤️ and record it to see those looks on those people’s faces when you gave them all that stuff 💯 that’s so supportive it makes me wanna do more for people who really need it
Mr. Beast wrecked ya in spending
AWESOME ! I am so glad you were able to donate these items . It is so good to see people do positive things for others .
This is why inlove Bryan hes humble & loves to help people in need 💕💕
I was about to comment and say you stole from mr beast without crediting rug, but luckily you didn’t it actually looks like he stole from you.
Mr.Beast bought everything in a store that wasn’t all 99 cents.
I love these vids anything nice with homeless people please go back again
99 cents Store is $1 and more but The Dollar Store is actually $1 everything
All that for $528, if that was in Sydney it would cost $2500. USA is cheap.
You da man Rug!
I hope you do more videos like this and keep donating to that place !! We need more stuff like this going on in the world!!
i love how he gets everything from mrbeast, does it 10x worst than him, and doesnt even mention him in his videos
Is seriously no one going to mention them both saying OMG at the same time! 8:01
Mr. Beast Wins.
FATALITY.
I love you faze the end of the video almost made me cry
I think the total is going to be like...1,200?
5:47 says the girl who drives a Mercedes
He doesnt even title this video:
Giving to the homeless
RESPECT
Mr beast: hold my beer.
you sould do buying one of everything from target
What he bought was like a 10% of what mr beast bought
This was the best video you made faze rug💘. I Love the video you make. You always bring positively. This is a great way to show influence to younger view💘💘💘
I LOVE how rug does this kind of videos and then gives it to people who really need it and other YouTubers don't do that ❤️❤️💖💞💕😍☺️
this should be called buying one thing of everything at 99 cents store
Imagine being the 2k that disliked this
Mr beast watched this video and said I need to improve this video idea and buys actually everything in a save a lot store
LIKE = TEAM Rug
REPLY = TEAM Tanner
👇  ( I make vids too btw )
Pulls up to a homeless shelter wearing Gucci
You rich uncultured swine who did u not know that everything isn’t .99 cents
This would be cool if mr beast didn’t do it first
Dang mr beast copied everything
My receipts be looking like phone numbers
Through the entire video I was just thinking about the bananas Rug picked up in the beginning that ended up in the bottom of everything😂
Your awesome Faze Rug. 💟👑✨
2:00 That's how you know you didn't go to college. Facts.
I would gave the cashier $100 for scanning everything
Ya buy everything from Gucci and that sucks not 99 cents
Next time if you want to buy everything for a $1.00 go to dollar tree
Oh think the total will be around 900 and 1000
Swear this guy just copied Mr Beats all the time 😂
This video was amazing!!! Your heart is huge. 🖤🖤
This copy's mr beast vidieo
I want you to but everything from Gucci store 1 like=for faze rug to do the video
$365 or $465
I think it will be 4500...

I was close..
People be like, what is a Lambo doing at a 99 cent store? Did he run out of money? LMAO


Edit: Damn! Last time I checked, this comment had 31 likes! Thank you so much for the likes! I really appreciate it! :)
mr beast bought everything lol
This was posted before my birthday. My birthday is on May 16, 2019

This is so inspiring! I wanna do this one day too, hopefully god blesses me with enough money one day to this.
Give a college  scholarship gift to a student challenge.
8:00 They said Omg At the Same Time XD
Mr beast bought everything from the storm
Rug bro you are amazing!! You are an inspiration to the world. Any little bit helps, but you went above and beyond. I'm soo glad I subscribed to you. Out of all these influencers you deserve everything you have and even more. You are the goat for sure
Who else is here because rug never uploaded today? Only me? Nahhh Ik there’s some of you
you had like a quarter of the store relax bro
parent trying to feed their starving children

Rug:

How Did YOU Get Into FaZe?
I clicked to see the total and ended with a beautiful surprise! +1 sub 🎉
paused the vid at 2:21 i think the grand total will be 1200 bucks
No one: 




Faze rug: 
You copy mr beast 🤦‍♂️😂 at this point it’s not even gonna get views, get new ideas this is boring
Mr Beast already did this
Should have gone to the Dollar Tree so you could buy everything for $1 each instead getting clickbaited by the 99 cent store.
I think that Faze rug will get the number closer
Faze rug u got an awesome big heart.l to donate to others. Ur mama reused ur right. Your family is super sweet
One day if I have  the money I will definitely donate to the poor ♥️iA
faze you got a big nose jk
Yo who else does not have 99cents store 
Yo I have dollar tree 
Like if you have dollar tree
cheap version of mr beasts video
All the dislikes were the people in line behind them that moved lines 😂
Who else teared up, just always be thankful for what you have because others may have little to nothing at all. God bless
I'd expect youtubers to put "donating" in the title for views but major respect
I always knew everything wasn't 99¢ it is just the cents that are 99 for example $12.99 three he
Mr beast:hold my beer
You warm my heart Brian ♥️
MrBeast: What is this ?
In dollar tree everything is a dollar !!!!🤠
I dare you to...




To like this faze rug video!!
Poor mr beast you copy him and so does morgzz seriously be original
This is how many times Bryan said For sure
RUG TRYNA BE LIKE MR BEAST NO HATE
MY GUESS IS 2700 and if i got it right then i did not skip to the end
I WORK HERE 😂😂
Mr.Beast out did this by a long shot
Mr. beast, Faze K, and Rug all copy each others videos. Don’t know If I am the only one who noticed.
You how youtubers donate 10k to streamers right???
They can help like 20 shelters if they do this
I think it will be around 3,000
2&5075  dollars I swear to god I didn’t look I put over my mom ❤️
Mrbeast just made faze rug look broke
Mr. Beast bought a whole store by the way
James Charles just twerked in your face.

Like to undo
Didn’t someone in twitter give you this idea?
2000 or 3000
I thought they will buy everything thing out of there like the store would be empty
Budget mr beast lol
See this is what i love about him and this is what makes me come back to his channel always because he gives away to everyone not only his family or friends but all those in need ..which i don't see most of youtubers do . Really proud to be a part of your channel and keep doing the good work ! You are amazing god bless you ✨
Definitely didn’t copy mr beast but that’s the game
Mr beast spends 70k😂
But Mr.Beast bought a whole store.
The people who have disliked this, you guys seriously need help.
If only I can afford to go into a 99¢ store.
omg at 7:30 thats kayln in the background at the cashier!!!!!
I say over 400$ and I say 4-7 baskets
This is a bit odd that it came out recently after mr beasts video
Mr beast did everything from a store
Mr Beast: Hold my pewdiepie sign
Hah mr beast outplayed you so hard
your video looks like a joke next to Mr. beast's  new video. jk jk
They started making some items more than a dollar around 2014-2015
Imagine if you did this at Cvs, the receipt machine would probably break
Should’ve gone to dollar tree😂🤣
Then you watch mr beasts video
I SHIP THEMMMM🥵🥵😍😍😍
I think Mr.Beast might have beat you...
I dont think that was everything at the 99 cent store tho... but good video
You both said omg at the same time
Why do you keep copying Mr. Beast? I mean it’s still good to donate but think of your own ideas.
I think it’s gonna be a total of $960
This is like Mr Beast but lest cheaper
FaZe rug is the best youtuber he's nice he should have 15000,000,000 subs
Wait y don’t u have any Blck friends and the ones u do u never show them
that's the ali express's version of mr beast video
Like this so he can see that we want him to donate again👌
This made me wanna do something like this 😩 doing it !
They have 49 rooms and 10 beds for women and the rest for men ?!￼
Why is it called the 99cent store if not everything is 99 cents ?? 🤣
Because I am on an extremely limited income, and disability barely pays the rent, I go to dollar stores quite often.. Just make sure that there is no lead if you give items to children. Thanks for caring about the homeless. I am trying to not be again. I feel sorry for the cashier. Keep up the good work. Hope it inspires others to start thinking about others
Whos here after watching mrbeast?
This was not EVERY item but... it was good enough 😃😀
you didn't empty the 99 cent store tho
I think it would be 1000
i just saw jonahs video callabbbbb please
Are you copping Mr.beast
You might as well buy the whole building😂
Everyone saying mr beast did better . I don’t see a single comment about what he did donating to the less unfortunate was awesome
My house is like 3 miles from a 99cents store I go there edit: sometimes
There is no such thing as a 99c store. They turned into dollar tree's about 20 years ago.
I actually cried at the end.
Does this remind anyone else of the helping hand challenge X did
faZe rug make the worlds cheapest store
It will be around 1200
he miss something he didnt buy the store
That's a good heart God is with y'all
8:02 they both said “oh my god” at the same time
Faze 
I like your videos pal 
I hope we can be friends , i am jalal from a war zone in mid East called yemen, can we chat on whatsapp some time bro.730070078
730070078
Mr beast has left the chat
Mr beast did the same thing but🍑 at a different shore
Me:Hi can I use Apple Pay?
Cashier:looks at shopping carts 
Cashier:quits job
Everything is 99 cents because when I went to dollar tree it was only one dollars
Not related to the video but noar has curves 😂
Mr. Beast did it better
He got this idea from Mr.Beast
My guess is $956.00.
Edit: Yo I was wayyyy wrong. Great vid Rug!
Did I you copy mr.Beast
This video has my heart❤
My guess is itll be around $528.63 total😁
I think 1400 items at the doller store
rug: “this channel is all for inspiring young people and spreading positivity!”

*rugs most popular video*: cocaine prank on mom!
Faze rug you should give some of it to the homeless
Mr Beast
Hmmm
Mr Rug
Hmmmmm
Lol mr.beast bought a whole store that was not cheap and u by one thing to say a cheap store bruh not impressed
Who the actual F would dislike a video that contains donating to homeless people?!?!? How heartless can people be? 😡
Your Mōm will never dìe ♥️





Líke and süb to activate for ur whole family
Buying everything in petco and donating it to dog shelter 🐕
God bless faze rug man 🙏🏽 besttt youtuberr
Dollar tree is $1 for everything
did you know everything at the dollar store isn't a dollar??
I know he didn’t throw a bag of Chex mix in the cart and say 1 chips
The only place I know where eveything is actually 1 dollar is Dollar tree
Faze rug: Buys everything from a 99 cents store

MrBeast: Buys the store
Make this blue if you love Faze 
👇( i create funny Fortnite vids )
a CVS receipt is longer with only 4 items
7:46 Soo are brian and kaelyn datingg again??? Because she is in a lot of viedoes and stuff
You should have gone to The Dollar Tree. everything there is 1 dollar
Mr beast: hold my sunglasses 

Buying all the clothes and blankets in my city
I promise, i’m in the begin of the video and I already think this is a bad idea😂
Brian you should go back and give them more back pack and blankets.
Hey rug. Do you have any tips for up and coming youtubers. Because I'm a youtuber too but I just don't know how to get noticed
The more u give the more you get blessed with! 
❤️🙌🏻🙏🏽
And this is the reason I’m subscribed to you ❤️ so kind & humble !!! Love ya rug
You shouldve tipped that poor cashier like $100
Its 99 cents store couse everything has the number 99 for example 1.99 😂😂
Meanwhile MrBeast:


World's Largest Bowl Of Cereal
7:47 kaylan what you doing girl 🤔. Like if you see her too.
It makes me want to go donate, thank you for inspiring me (:
He so blessed
This is so amazing 😉 God bless
the homeless more than faze rug. 😤
Mrbest did more than you
As well as copying mr beasts vids all the time he CLICKBAITS this one. can we have some yikes in the chat
This is the budget version of mr beasts vid
He should do the buying every thing challenge from the 99 cents store
That wasnt everything but still good
Rug is so nervous talking to the lady lol 😬
Won like won slap / box
Did anyone else see Mr. Beast's video? 



BTW Im a small YouTuber wanting to grow. Im also giving away a Starbucks card when I reach 100 subscribers!
Mr beast just uploaded this today

love your videos it be lit
mr beast just out did you
Going to be like around 3000
Hey you Mr.beast didnt shout you out for the video idea
9876 - wild guess am at 2 min rn
Why would you only buy one of each item because now you can only give one kid a backpack or one kid a blanket instead of everyone a backpack and blanket. Stoopid
The cheap verson of mr beast
Bruh all rug has been doing is copying everyone else’s video for the past few weeks.
Next video: buying one of each thing in petco and donating it to the animal shelter Also This is fred -> 🐢 Keep him at the top because he can't swim also we need Brian to see this so the animals have help too C:
Tf they didn’t bought everything
God bless u and u family
Mr beast bought everything from the store
You are going to get the closest dollar amount rug
MrBeast went to a store and spent 70k buying and entire store and donated it but I mean still faze rug did a lot but not as much
Doing what does good, always feels good, while doing what feels good doesn't always do good. A definite thumbs up.
So did mr beast copy him or did rugz copy mr beast?
This video was already done by tgf
Faze rug: Buys every item in 1 dollar store

MrBeasr: Im gonna end this mans career





for anyone who doesnt know mr beast bought everything in a store (70k in tital)
You stole this from Mr. Beast
That is the longest recipt I have ever seen
Cheaper version of mr beasts video
I hate that this is becoming into a Copy Mr Beast Channel. Be original.
Swear to god he’s tryin to be Mr. Beast
U just copied mrbeast video and didn’t even shout him out
This is nothing compared to Mr. Beast
Poor dude got absolutely destroyed by Mr beast
How was all that only $528
Mr beast: hold my beer
I haven’t finished the video but I bet the checkout took forever
Do you guys not have dollar trees everything there is actually a dollar
Love you rug your an amazing person ❤️
the first min of this vid equals to my monthly income
thats what im talking about  me and my daughter do this every friday but what we can afford around 100$ but it brings so much joy and even hope to the homeless and helpless like most have no idea what one backpack will do for someone etc.
11000
Should’ve gave the cashier a tip
Mr beast buys everthing in a store
You ever put a thumbs down you should be mad at yourself
BOO FAZE RUG CHEAP DONT LOOK AT THE PINEAPPLE 😂😂😂 AND ALSO FAZE RUG THX FOR DOING THIS BUT CAN YOU DO IT IN AN EXPENSIVE AND MORE NORMAL STORE NOT 99¢

I really think you are making change in the world for the better and I really appreciate it. ❤️You outdid urself here and I feel like even though there is so much negativity and shit on social media everyday you keep using your platform in the most influential and mature ways that I’ve EVER seen. You touched SO many. Very genuine and I appreciate it. Not much ppl like that nowadays❤️
damn rug was at my hometown
I wish all youtubers did this. People with so much money can really do so much!!! And it sucks people that have money dont think like you do ❤️
Not everything is $.99
Yeh I knew things where dearer

Wait but that says 99€ only
Barely saw one of your videos yesterday and subscribed immediately! Gonna continue support you 😭🙏🏽
Yeah I knew that not everything was 1 dollar until I first t the store. Before that I thought everything was a dollar plus taxes on certsin things.
Should have gone to dollar tree everything there is 1 dollar
A 10:14 it looks like Faze rug / Brayan is wearing makeup
Y’all should do a buying everything in family dollar ??
I'm only 13 but I saved up about 200$ about two years ago, and went to the dollar tree and made helping bags for the homeless.😁
You are such a good person
ItS probably going to be 5555555

What happened to your huracán and range Rover?
Feels bad for the cashier
$4000
She low key looks like the merrel twins
That awkward moment when your girlfriends voice is deeper than yours
$999
It’s just one thing that sucks. That I help the the less fortunate sometimes when I see them with signs but most of the time I get scammed.  It’s just those guys make the people who really need it look bad
Do more of this
Ok it will be 1 million dollars I bet
I was in paris for 7 days and i had 50€ and there was no food at the hotel so we had to buy everything and i gave 1€ to every homeless person i saw(and they had cute dogs too)
I asked my friends who is the most kindest youtuber to watch and a majority of them told me Mrbeast. Comparing what I just watched on his channel (placing strangers into a huge bowl of urine soaked cereal to see who lasts longest) as well as seeing him donate money only to attractive females on twitch. I have to say hands down that your channel is without a doubt more inspiring in one video than all of his videos combined. Don't ever stop being humane, kind and compassionate. You have one more new subscriber from Australia now :)
My wife looking thicc as always😂😍🔥
I’d hate to be the cashier 😭😭 but I love what you’re doing💗

I was eating and I drop it in my shirt when I saw the store LOL
Everything in 99 cent stores are always 99 cents and up. They have a sign that says that. So basically the store shouldn’t even be called a 99 cent store.

My favorite part is when his mom ripped the bag open 😂🥰
U should make a video on getting a haircut the person in front of u just had
Honestly a couple things to say, the mothers reactions were so cute and also! I love how these boys can shop and not get bored
Shit made me cry lowkey needa stop taking my mom for granted
This whole time I thought Anthony and junior had the same mom lol
Why is no one admiring MAMA RUG’s nails?!!! 😂🤦🏻‍♀️😘😤
I can't wake up to go kiss or hug my mom because she is dead. so i just go to her grave to put flowers and tell her about my day. R.I.P 1968-2016...mom i miss you💖💖
Wow I loved the reaction all the mom's made🤗😎💙🌹😍 it's so heart melting🌹🌹😍💙
His dad at the end is just like,





Dad: Where’s my gift? oh wait it’s mother’s day 😭
You're about to have more subs than James Charles!
8:50 I’m not tryna mess u up after throwing heavy and random items at him 😂😂🤣🤣
Omg I loved juniors moms reaction!!😂💞
Mr Beast:All you can carry I’ll buy!

FaZe Kay:All you can carry I’ll buy!

FaZe Rug:Hold my beer!
15:35 "10 dollars off -claps-" I clapped with them LMFAO
Juniors mom just ripped the bag open when she saw it!🤣😂
I’ve been watching rug for like 4 years and realized junior and Anthony aren’t brothers today... Is Anthony an only child ? 😭😭😂😂😂😂

Them: “omg nordstrom is so expensive”
Them at Guicci: omg look at this shirt for $950 i guess I’ll buy it
😂😂😂😂
Who misses the scary tunnels and stuff he used to do
Faze Rug: You can pick any store theres no limit!
Me: Take my ass to the gucci store bra
When rug said “ I think my mom would look cute in these”😩♥️😂
Momma Rug: keep em coming.. I LOVE YOU 😅💗
Damn junior moms more happier then my mom when I get straight A’s😔🤣
@FazeRug straight love keep doing what u love. Mothers rock😍😍😍😘
Where tf is the hat 😂 I wanted to see her reaction 😂😂😂😂
I was about to say rug is messed up until he told Anthony he can still get his gifts 😂
Everything you can gift, only if it comes from your heart
Anthony "my mom will finally love me'' lol me😂😂😂
Make sure you like if it wasn't for u fans he wouldn't be doing this just give him some love👌
Make this blue if you love mama rug❤❤
For Anthony losing I feel like it was rugs fault bc he put it on there not very supported so I feel like for one rug has to give him another chance...
Our mother's day was in March..
Junior mom had the best reaction 😊
Rug defiantly don’t have a problem with his videos not being advertised friendly
You are literally the best guy ever! I just started watching your vids and I love them!❤️
Why does Anthony and his mom look the same age though🤣🤣 like if u agree
At least u gave credits to Mr beast
J's mom has the best reaction ever , she's too excited
When are you moving to Faze house
that thing fell off his box bcz rug placed it to where it would...
6:38 Anthony: “she’s gonna love me finally” 😂😂
To the beautiful mother’s what about the ugly ones 😂😂
"Do you think I my mom would wear this?"
"Maybe if you owned a farm and she was trying to be a scarecrow"

I'm wheezing 🤣🤣
Love you💙💎💙 guys and your💙💎💙 family 🥰😍 Happy 🧡🌸🌼🌷🎉💐Mother’s Day 💐mama Rug 💐🌸🌼
makes jokes about pants being $70 but spends $500 on a gucci shirt wtf

Edit.   THANK YOU FOR ALL THE LIKES
I never knew that Jessica is juniors sister
"I carried this with only two of my hands" how many hands do you have? Lmao
Rug: "Don't worry I checked her size too"
Also Rug: grabs random clothes without checking the size
One day when youtube dies off, hell regret throwing 20 grand to his parents 🤷🏻‍♀️
Can I just have a family like you just giving all these blessings so jealous !!☺️💕💕
It's also my b-day rug can you PLZ wish me happy birthday 🎉 PLZ

Wish I could afford to spoil my mum like that.. she deserves it.. 
Happy Mother’s Day! ❤️

He said you better make the right choices mama rug is a scary girl 😂😂
Make this blue if you love your mother 
👇🏼
@fazerug this really touched my heart 💓
Juniors mom had the best reaction !😌💛
Why u didn’t go to gucci or lv o some like that 
U win +10k for a vid
Hey mama rug if you don’t want the 10,000 I’ll take it jk😂☺️🤣
She opened her eyes and gasped and said “omg what is it, gasps michael kors omg i love it”
Junior's mom was so grateful, that was so cute. Your family is beautiful, Mama Rug and Papa Rug did an amazing job raising you both. You guys are so blessed❤
Faze rug has to be lying about him only benching 10 pounds. 
Bro im a 12 year old boy that can bench like 20-30 pounds.
No hating but he literally coped every one of mrbeast vids tbh
how many times REPEATED & SAME CONTENT we r very BORED.
Omg I love all of your moms,but Anthony‘s mom is low key the sweetest ☺️
Damn again, no credit to the People who did this first, rug you’ve just lost a sub
10k wow 😭 that’s awesome 
I wish I was blessed like that
But jr mom is amazing ! After getting only the same thing ! ❤️
When rug said just my too hand 

Me ya sure😂😂
Junior: Happy Mothers Day!!

Juniors Mom: RIPS OPEN BAG*
Me beast: new challenge idea
Rug: hippity hoppity your are now my property
He copied this challenge from other youtubers
literally a bunch of people in the background turned and noticed it was Faze Rug at the mall 😂
All I have to say is.. doing videos with your family makes my days! I love them and you of course!! Keep the good work!! Happy
Wish I was stacked like Brian cause I'd spoil my parents like they  have spoiled me
5:35 "idk what is this, oh theres like some face stuff" 😂😂
This My Most Favorite Video Of All Your Videos
Random question but anyone know how tall rug is?
I loved all of their reactions, made me smile, all of you are great sons 💗
JR’s moms reaction was the best she ripped that bag like if it’s tissue paper
What?? Mother’s Day is a different day in America then uk 






Also you found a comment that’s is not asking for a like we know you love your mom
wish i could give my mom everything she wanted 🥺 she deserves the world 😭❤️
Papa rug is so funny with those glasses
~ When Junior's Mom Ripped That Bath And Body Works Bag Open....Hilarious...Hey Hey Hey Hey....Great Video ~
I love getting to meet the family! Brian you should do a family tree video because I always get confused about who is related to who.
You stole this idea from Mr.Beast
R.I.P Hammy (2016-2017)(i think that was his lifetime)
Juniors mom and Brian’s mom looks the same ❤️
So pretty much the lower version of Mr.Beast ? Noice
Faze rug you are such a good person you spread positivity around and are so generous you are so amazing thus is why i am subscribed to you ❤
Mr. Beast and you are the best. I Watch you guys all the time
Ive been watching this in class😂!!
Bro junior mom was happy lol big fan i liked and been subscribed
faze rug  i love my parents and yours;)
Omg rug looks hilarious. Gotta love him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pickup 👀 videos dude bring some creativity please
It's really sweet how Faze Rug bought all those gifts for the moms.. Making the moms feel good on mothers day ❤
The best part of the video 15:13
If that was me I would just buy computers and like 20k$ of Xbox cards😂🤣
15:18 junior's literally shock😂🤣
Hallmark cards:everyday should be mothers day
Brains bank account:🤷‍♀️
Junior's mom was soo happy 😭❤❤
Rug: “pick any store there are litterly no limits”
Cousins: picks MaCy’s and BoDy WoRks 👏🏻
Happy mothers to all 3 moms that was the sweetest challange loved it
I think everyday is mother and fathers day because they do so much for us and we should give more respect our parents.  
- Ismail.❤️
Mama rug looks gorgeous in anything we love u❤️❤️
juniors moms reaction is THE CUTEST THING EVER
hey brian wheres the hat??🤪
where is mrbeasts credit my guy stealing video ideas and claiming them as his own (dont get me wrong i love rug)
Rug you are one of the sweetest person I know you truly have a good heart 🧡 never change that.
Rug:How much is this? 
Sherman: 40 Bucks... 
jay: “for straw” 😂
I'm sorry but you copied Mr beast
I don't think junior's mom has ever seen bath and body works products
For the next video you should play hind and go seek in the dark like you did a long time ago
Best part was the mom's reactions ❤ great video and idea and fathers day should be just as big fathers are so underappreciated
thank you bro really it was awesome that your work
You will have good luck for the rest of the year




Like to activate

Mr.Beast totally didn't do this first🙄
Faze Rug and Original Content to mix
rent out a flatbed truck and get a Honda Civic on the back that's carrying a car right?
I would bought a 1000 card then buy stuff online lmao
Everyone give a like for all the mothers and subscribed to FazeRug
It was amazing how the parents reacted.
7:21 the kids in the background obviously knew who you were 😂
You know Brian is running out of ideas when he copies someone’s idea ALL the time
 

No offense just
I love Anthony’s mom she’s so chill and looks like an amazing person.
Original.







-_-
Is it me or Faze rug is really cheaping out on theses compared to Mr. Beast?
DAMN. You've given your mom 10k like 5 times now if not more!
Ur just really kind hearted♥️♥️
Copying Kay and mr. Beast I see

Yes we do and this is  thoughtful  and I’m crying Cub Scout out my body
Happy Mother’s Day everybody I had the best day with my mom 😄👩‍👦💐❤️
I thought Antony & junior have same mom
if they were smart they would grab every gift card wouldn't you?
I love your shopping videos. and helping the homeless.
You copied my man Beast... you're kinda running out of video ideas but I still love you Brian. (As a fan) At least you credited him.
Wow, I didn’t hear a “Habibi”
Can You make a video where You take CARE of the Earth. You and your friends pisking up as much trash You can. Take CARE of earth.
.........





Who wouldn't wanna do MrBeast's challenges?
When you coincidentally have 2 relatives with black shirts so you wear a white one to be the center of attention 😅👍🏼👌🏼
YO Brian mother's day isn't nothing without you because you made her be a mom

You are exaggerating the price when I see in most of your vids you wear Gucci
I can only dream of 10,000 dollars....

IT WAS FROM SAFFRON BARKER SHE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
Sweetest gift! 😭❤️

your videos are great, but the idea came from mr beast though he made ir better
People to do this video:
First- Mrbeast
Second- Brawadis
Third- Momma and Papa Rug
Fourth -FaZe Rug
Stole from mr beast dgaf if he was inspired

I'm sorry but rug has become unoriginal and I've stopped watching him because of that
I knew mrbeast did this
"Do people really get just cards and stuff like that...?" The sad reality is yes, most people do that, and it's a damn shame.
Great blessed video Brian let’s get you to 13 million!! Happy Mother’s Day to all mothers
I wish i can get stuff like that for my mum but i can’t😭

You are legit mr beast wannabe
0:28 ahhhh I remember this video they had sooooo much fun
13:53 the way he ran 😂
Where’s the hat for mama rug ? 😂
Faze rug let me start by saying I have been watching your videos for a long time now, and I love your videos and seeing how close your family is. Family is very important and if I had the means to do what you do for your family I would do the same but, I would like to see you make a difference in someone’s life or even your community instead of always throwing $10,000 at someone who can complete a challenge but hey it’s your money just saying. Still love your videos though and also tell your mom happy Mother’s Day!
England have already had mother's day.
Mr beast copy
Mr beast copy

Juniors Mom tho👀👅
Aye dude i wish i couldve said that to my mom or got her something but i havent seen her in a long time  faze rug i love watching ur videos keep it up hopefully one day i could play a game of fortnite
I don’t live with my mom ☹️
Beautiful moms!😌😌🙏🏼
everything is about $$ with u get new ideas lol it's getting repetitive
Wait is junior jessicas brother? Or
Who said there wasn’t kind rich people?🤔
Right on rug, I love the video. I just want to say, enjoy every moment with your mom. I lost my mom when I was two years old. I’m now 20 years old and me and my dad live together on our own. I have 3 siblings but we’re all kind of separated, but I still get to see them every now and then. I mostly see my brother, my two sisters don’t really live nearby so it kind of sucks. Just saying bro, enjoy every moment with your family and keep up the great content. I love all your videos and I just started watching you a while ago.
MrBeast did it better
Ok wen did he get a tattoo???
I wish i could buy sum like that to my mom
SORRY IF I MADE YOU HUNGRY! COMMENT DOWN BELOW YOUR FAVORITE FAST FOOD!!
Paid for everyone behind and didn’t even make it the title of the video. Respect for this guy
Rug is literally so nice. He gave the burger to his dad and didn’t eat for the rest of the night. He also payed for everyone behind him. I appreciate him.
“Alright guys we just pulled up to In-n-Out” 

shows picture of Shake Shack
Bro I swear Faze rug is the best YouTuber not just youtuber but a good human being bro we blessed to have someone like him he’s so cool and nice to people
Huge respect to you for paying for all the meals at in n out, you just gained a loyal subscriber 😊
Press this if you love your mom

⬇
Bro he made our screens glitch out so he could slow down the weel to land on carles jr
Basically Faze Rug doing like 5 Muk bangs in 1 video
Which is better

Like:McDonald’s 
Reply:KFC
I cant grab some food I’m fasting😂
Man who else tought their phone was freezing when he got Carls jr
Me watching the ad at the end of the video to make sure rug gets paid more
I am fasting for Ramadan so I am hungry
My favorite fast food is 🍗
Once in a while I get something new
Damn I’ve been watching food vids since the start of Ramadan 😂 I’m so hungry 


53 minutes till break fasting oof
Bro I’m fasting HOW DO U EXPECT ME EAT WITH U J WISH THO LOVE YOUUU
Rug: Pays for every car behind him

Mr. Beast: Hold my beer
I literally enjoyed the whole video. you show how you really care about others & your family, keep doing what you’re doing rug best wishes from me!! ❤️
It’s Ramadan and I want to eat :(
Buddy I can't grab snacks during the vid, I'm fasting. RAMADAN MUBARAK from Canada my brothers
Nice Edit on the In and Out spin... lol   ;0)
This is how many Gucci things Rug owns


1 Like = 1 clothing item
yall notice the 2 in n out cups wen he hands his dad the food?? sus i think he bought himself more food but 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
Ur such a good person keep it up ;)
Literally nobody:
Rug: you have all been commenting for me to do this
I funny  when you said you had to spin the wheel again for breakfast about the hand move
Pretty sure Rug is the only person who would pay for everyone behind him and not even mention that in the title. "No biggie, just paid for like 50 cars'
You eating Carl’s Jr. In your lambo
If you don’t like donuts, your on something.
I know he went to cvs to get that receipt for the thumbnail
Roses are red 
Some factories have food
Wait I got a like?
But why is it blue?
I think it’s because all the rug-rats are beautiful like you!!!!
who else saw the glicthing at 8:51 like the vid soo faze rug can see it
I literally bought a McDonald cheese burger 🍔just to watch this 😂
Faze bro there chocolate chip frappe good 💓💯
When your 14 just hit puberty but taller than Rug
Why was he throwing the meat so hard 🤣
Imagine being rich enough that you can pay for other people’s meals I’m so broke I can’t even pay for my own 😭
Watch our challenge !! 😂💙 we did the same one ! 
Taco Bell is def our favorite but you guys have more options over there than here in Miami
The editor put a photo of SHAKE SHACK instead of IN&OUT lmao
But I like when he paid for everybody 🤝✊🏽
I love that outro beat, plus your just an amazing person in general.
Imagine if someones do one of these videos and the person in front is doing an "ordering the entire menu challenge" 😂😂
I was drinking a choc chip frappe when you ordered it lmao
I ate a big bowl of cereal but I'm still hungry
I'm fasting so I can't grab any food and watch you.But I still can watch you without food 🙂.
Hi!, your video is great
that looks great.
Keep Sharing
he's so sweet aawww he paid for the rest of the cars behind him and he gave his food to his parents, Love You Rug
Your vid randomly glitched but all the love dude

#17:37 what did you say lol😂
Sooo...

I see you watch Derek Gerard as well
He is one of the most Genuine/Caring Youtubers!!! PERIOD
Oh noooo the video was gliching so I came to the comments to see if it did for anyone else but.... it didn't 🤦‍♂️💀😭
I stick with the same order every time I go to a fast food but At Starbucks I get different things every time
Hajime!!!!
this has to be one of my fave videos specifically for this challenge by any YouTuber. I especially loved ❤️❤️❤️ the ending.
I wonder how Brian's stomach was feeling the next morning...
This Man Put The Picture In The Video😂😂😂 Rug A Real One 😂
i love Faze Rug so much, he's stays out of drama, he's such a positive person, he's awesome, and his videos are GREAT!!!
This is by far the best “letting the person in front of me  pick what I eat “ video ever on YouTube!! ♥️😩
Hey rug! Try living on minimum wage for 1 whole week for a video! Your life is completely different income wise so it would be awesome to see!
If im extremely hungry I'll order the same thing i usually order cause i know i like it lol
Jessica : rug just woke up and said someone is gonna decide what I eat today 

Rug: yea that fun it's fast food rolETTE 

 TO 
Been here since like 600k maybe even before that can’t remember it was a long time ago but I love you rug ❤️ and this was and awesome video and the end of the vid was perfect made me feel really happy keep it up brotha🙏💯
I'm literally binge watching all your videos love you <3
I swear whenever it's a "special guest" it's always one of Rug's exes or family members.🤣
I literally said it’s going to land on Krispy Kreme and it did
At fast food places I get different things so I can see what I like best 🙃🖤
Damn not gonna give Derek Gerard any recognition for making the challenge
What if you the person in front of you was a mukbang channel, and it was like the whole menu😂
@FaZe Rug   letting Siri decide what I eat for 24 hours!!
YEAH, it is fast food ROOOUUULLLEEETTEEE
They discontinued chocolate chip frappe in my area😭it was so good
Of all the videos I’ve seen of youtubers do this challenge I haven’t heard one say “food is food” and be so grateful, 

Love you rug ❤️
Omg I cant believe you paid for all the cars... bless your heart..
8:51 any1 else got a glitch? Or am I stupid and that wAs an edit😂 bc it also “glitched” on my Apple TV🤷🏻‍♀️😂
Your kitchen is the same as the family in Smile More🤷‍♀️
Finally my favorite YouTuber doing this challenge 😇
That KFC looked AMAZING!
Derek is watching you
Let me know if you know what im talking about
FaZe rug is so nice to pay for everyone I wish I was in that queue keep up the good work bro you impressed ur mum and dad
What if they ordered a cup of ice only for the bottle of water they had the day before yesterday🤣🤣🤣
You're so sweet. Ive watched a few of your videos and I love the content. I don't know why I wasn't subscribed though. Now I am 😇
Faze rug:you have 5 seconds to like the video
Me: ha jokes on you I already liked it
I love how Rug cares about ever body and think about the best in people🤧💞
The last 3 min of this video made me so happy because how freaking generous Brian is with paying for all of those people behind him. FAZE RUG IS THE BEST 🙌🏼
You got this from Derek Gerard you a clout chaser
Faze Rug: Sit back relax grab some food
 
Me: MOM can I have mac n cheese
Aww man I freaking love Brian 😭❤
Wow, nice job crediting Derek Gerard the original creator
When you realize faze rug payed for your in n out a couple of nights ago
19:10 that's really amazing I salute you bro!
Carlos Jr where I'm from its called Hardee's lol
16:05 getting the exact same thing squad wya😂✋🏼
Hounestly I love you I love your vid and you have such a big Herat I really hope there will be more people like you I. This world because like it’s always just so nice to see people like you I love you ❤️
Ramadan Mubarak to all the people who celebrate it❤
Real ones know this came from Derek Gerard
Yoooo atleast make a shoutout for Derek he started this content he made two videos 1 month ago and 1 video three weeks ago and other people did it like 1 week ago so u plagiarized
I love watching you because no matter how much fans or money you have your very humble! You have so much respect and are so genuine, it’s unbelievable!! Your parents must be so proud !
you made me cry when you were thoughtfull about the people in the big car line and when you gave your
hambuger & fries to you
dad.
The ending made me "awwww" 😭💕Love u rug👍👍such a great person.
I'm your biggest fan 😊 my fav is 🌯bell
FaZe Rug I love how your always so generous and kind and smart
I usually like the video before it beginnings 😂
Subway has always been my Favorite! God bless you for the love and generosity, you totally made someone's night!
You should do a “using google to talk for 24 hours challenge” I would want to see that 🤣
I stick with that same order LMAOOO <3
So we’re just gonna ignore the fact that a “gourmet sandwich” place is next to a subway 😭😂
You didn't give any credit to Derek Gerard
instead of sharing. You should of bought 2 of the same order.
Brian has the biggest heart in the world❤️
I always try new things like let's say I go to Dutch bros I'll say gimme a surprise redbull😂
Yasssss! You did the challenge i was hoping for you to do!!!
Stick with my order a lot of the time but not always
Faze I like you and all but y did you not shout out Derek Gerard he’s pretty cool and original
Maybe you should let a subscriber decide what you eat for 24 hours😂😂😅
I REALLY FIND HIM GENUINE 🥺😍
This video was made by derek gerard but you added the wheel you did not give him any credit
He's so nice let God protect you and your family faze Rug
U r so amazing ❤️ so nice that u paid for all those people 😍😍 luv u so much 😘
Bro out of all the drive thru videos I've seen of this challenge, yours is by far the coolest. Way to put an original spin (literally) on the concept lol. Also paying it forward & having a grateful attitude no matter what is one of the reasons why you're AWESOME. 🔥🔥🔥
Jessica lowkey looks like the female version of TSM_Myth
Also I get the same thing every time.😂
Did you know that yummy XOXO was the one who invented this challenge
Rug: I see you guys requesting this video alot 
Rug's comment section: Only OG's remember flush factory. Or, James Charles just kissed you, like to undo
7:09

Mom: why do you do all those tiktaks (tiktok) all day josh 


Me :
20:22 did someone else see the TWO in-n-out drinks ? 🤔








Not hating , still a great video . So nice that he paid for everyone behind him too 😊
Grab some food 
Uhh im fasting lmao
Sorry I cant grab food I'm fasting hahahaha but I'll just continue watching lol

7:10
Derek Gerard...NO shout out he has done other trending stuff like the dart please shout him out
He is such a nice and genuine person. I love this dude
Who else went back 10 sec to like the vid.
Everyone pretty much stole this idea from Derek Gerard , he made his video a month ago and everyone be making these vids 3 weeks ago
He says "no complaining on this channel or in life". But like 5 seconds before he said " no I had subway earlier so can we re spin please". 😂😂😂 I love you rug
You have such a big heart! 😭💕
Yo wassup Brian ur vids are lit 🔥
Omg seriously the most thoughtful
YouTuber!
I remember eating Carl's Jr and I got sick in the morning I threw up
Who Else Knew FaZe Rug Would Do This Video??? 😂😂🙌🏼
Faz thank you for sharing this video love watching it this is a  great video it is going around everywhere you have a wonderful day
Honestly.... Where his mom and dad work?
2:19
"Okay. alright. thank you.. Yeah thats it"
You have a great heart!! ❤️ I love your vids!! Wish I could meet you
Jessica and faze rug look like they could   be twins!!👧👨
You should credit Derek Gerard for your whole youtube career
Im unsubscribing if you are copying his videos and not giving him credit
this is my first video that i have seen from you and already i can see that you are such a nice person and i see where you get it from... your parents are so kind! you just earned a new subscriber 💙
Collab with ChadWithAJ (contenntttt) and Derek Gerard ( the creator)
Faze rug: everytime i come to this mcdonalds i meet fans.

Me:😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rug gets big and forgets McDonalds, like if u remember lol
Your a good YouTuber and you have a great personality
hungry jacks triple cheesburger meal (large) (im 10)
A tad late in this comment section but I literally dived into the shops to grab some food I got so Hungry!! Hahah
amazing video , and a humble guy you deserve my subscription
😂When he said “Okay McDonald’s isn’t that bad” then he showed us a picture of a nasty burger it had me dying😂😂
I just finished by Burger King so glad I didn’t watch this earlier
I mean he is a millionare so paying for all the cars behind him is nothing, i would do that too just to get more fan support.
I would’ve been spinning the wheel every 10 minutes
This is from Derek Gerard,

No hate
No complaining on this channel 😂5 seconds earlier "no i had subway earlier plz can we respin😂😂"
The fact that he paid for everyone’s meal was awesome 👏🏻
I had a  meal before watching this video and it made me hungry all over agian
Where is YRNDJ SHOUT OUT HE STARTED IT.
I always get the 8 piece fill up bucket from kfc because I have a family of 4 ☺️ but from other fast food places I usually get different things
Spins the wheel:
Brian: Subway?
Brian and Jessica: Are you down?



😂😂😂😂😂
U should mention that u got the idea from Derrick Gerard
yea we saw you you change it from in n out to krispy cream :) 11:09
Jesus both those girls in this video are haggard AF bro, you gotta step your game up man.
I get glazed at Krispy Kreme cause it is SOOOO GOOD.
Who misses rugs tunnel video??
(Like to agree)
My favourite fast food is KFC and I get the same thing 🙂🙂
Whenever I see videos like this I always wonder what the people around you guys wonder when they see this, or hear what y’all are saying😂
I get the same thing anywhere I go😭
Even tho there the same Hardee's is better than Carl's Jr.
Respect ✊🏻 

You paid for ALL the cars behind you...


Stay humble
i ALWAYS order the same thing xD
If rug wasn’t paying for their food for attention he wouldn’t have it for the first clip 🤣
Respect This Moment :D and the paid money. 20:07
“Grab some food” well habibi I’m fasting soooo🤣
Next challenge add more varied restaurants other than fast food. Slide a couple of full service ones in for dinner. LOVE YOUR VIDS BRO.... KEEP EM COMING!!
I WOULD NOT EAT INSIDE MY URUS, BRYAN.... PLEASE NOO,  nice video btw 😊😜
Rug say oh shit at 17:13 he didn't blur it like always
Hey remember in San Diego when my brother saw you and took a picture
His friend sounds like Louise from Bobs Burgers and Mabel from Gravity falls
Brian-no please no subway I just had you can spin again 10 seconds later kfc ehh it’s okay food is food no complaints on this channel 😂😂😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
We must protecc rug at all costs
U said no complainting but u complained about going to subway broooo
The end made me cry there needs to be more people like you in the world 😥🙇‍♀️
He said “no complaining in life” easy for u to say buddy 😂
God bless this guy he's soo nice ❤️😇
Gonna love faze rug cause everything he does to make people happy 💖
atleast give credit to The yt’er


No hate love The vids
FaZe Rug has such a good heart ❤️
Faze Rug is the type of person to eat food in a $300,000 car
What was that glitch on your 2nd spin
I litterly do get the same thing but also like trying new things😂👏
Go follow Derek Gerard he came up with this idea
i respect you so much for being so real and kind, you're the most humble youtuber ever
The way these guys have grown up on You tube is crazy🐜 and it's we people who subscribe and watch their videos and now let's see who subscribes small channels who are just starting, keep coming guys,, much love to all ❤❤❤
You made me hungry if you got hungry like this comment
I felt like Molly would be in this video
Subway is my fav fast food place
17:38 he says “Do you want In n n out!??” 😂😂 lmfaooo had me wheezingggg
Haven’t watched a FaZe Rug video let alone any faze video in like almost 2 years
Ah, well, I wasn't tryna like your video anyway
Tbh I get the same thing all the time when I order from any fast food
Didn't shout out Derek Gerard for starting
Faze Rug: Please no subway I just ate that!
10 seconds later
Faze rug: no complaining on this channel food is food
McDonald’s !!! Great video Brian that was a great thing that you did !!! 😊God bless you and everyone who reads this comment
My go to order at McDonald's is large red flash no ice
Before I started watching this video I got chips popcorn a burger and a slushy because I knew I was gonna get hungry 😋
Hey you didnt created Derek gerard made it First give him a shout out at lease
Watching this while fasting is probably a bad idea 😭😭
LOL I always order the same thing!
Why is he eating chicken with a fork 🤣😂
When he said “it’s fast food RoUlEtTe” I felt that. (7:11)
Watching this makes me so jealous because i just got my wisdom teeth pulled out and i can't eat LOL but at the same time this is pretty satisfying 😂
i can't eat now im FASTING because we are in RAMADAN !!
Bro I wish I can meet your dad
1:49 Rug said go get yourself some food so I paused the video and grilled myself a steak
I would have STACKED yo sub sandwich
Bruh they stealing from Derek Gerard

Nice vid but obviously preplanned
Rug:”do you want in in n out”🤣
17:36

This is how many years Rug gonna live for 
👇🏼👇🏼





Dam I wish this got 1k likes I want Rug to live for more than that 😭😭
brooo i thought my laptop was glitching
Rug said he wanted Starbucks, then got mc Donald’s and got a drink from there which is similar to a drink at start bucks and he said he wanted food. 😂😂 me no understand
He rigged it when it was at 6:45 cause it just suddenly stopped
Brian, your shirt is so dope!!
Who else noticed @ 20:22 in the video that there’s 2 in and out cups sitting there when only “one was ordered”
Did you plan for the video to be 21:21 long
Why is everyone copying Derek Gerard
@11:55 = sus
We need more nice people like him in this world.
I know that this comment will get mixed up with the rest of y’all comments but...


This is how many people wish to meet Rug❤️💫
  
⬇️
bro you should have @ Mystic
wheres the derek gerard shout out he was the og 1


my dg fans where you at
1.44 could not relate anymore XD
You should do Instagram followers control your life again with insta polls
I get the same thing too but I like to switch it up and try something different every now and then. Especially when my favourite thing gets boring because usually it always does. I usually order other people’s favourites and it always ends up being mine too.
your teeth are so perfect I love it lmaoo
Why does no one give Derek credit for starting this?
Imagine the person in front of you is MATT STONIE
The cuts swear it was first try lol 

👇🏻Like this for good luck
Yo rug how many meals u eat a day i only eat two breakfast and dinner
I am actually supposed to be studying but I decided to watch this video, I never skipped any part of it, you made the video super fun to watch and you paid for everyone behind you! We need more kind hearted people like you! Love you❤️❤️😘😘❤️❤️😍😍😍💕💕💕💕

Donuts I prefer Yum Yum donuts the Best kind there is because there is nothing better than Old fashioned Donut shops

It depends on what restaurant it is but most of the time the same thing. Favorite is everything
I stick with the same order every time.
"So you want in n out" skip into
 the 10th try in n out
Love your videos! Thanks for inspiring me to make my own! <3
I wanna try a lot of things but only thing I can get is mc spicy because I’m broke
You should do a day of challenges , like what car you should take , what you should eat, where you should go , etc ,  like a normal vlog but just a day of challenges ive never really seen anyone do that so i think it would be perfect for you , also very very big fan ive seen your vlogs for a while now !!❤️
Danget, I can't like the video

No hate... But most of the time everything he says sounds like a question.
I subscribed simply because you paid for everyone and I watch another video where you donated to a homeless shelter. Your parents did an amazing job, it's a breath of fresh air seeing a younger person be so giving.

Love he showed a beautiful pic of his cousin b4 she got in the car, and then when she gets in it looks nothing like her. Pictures can be deceiving...
Rug actin like we didn’t notice him spin the wheel 100 times until he got in n out 17:13
Completely stolen from @mattdoesfitness smh
The 2nd person in the car looks like IT when his teeth come out😂😂
20:21 why is there 2 drinks on the table? I thought he only got one meal or correct me if the meal comes with a soda and a milkshake
Did anybody else watching this it glitched ?
Derek Gerard
Mc donalds pamcakes stop sleepin on them cuhz
Hmmm... There shirts😅😂
“Every time I come to McDonald’s I meet fans”


*he shows a picture of a fan 


Me: IM DEAD
I always get the same meel

13:59 when you get hit in the nuts and try to pretend like it didint hurt
Dons breakfast is unreal
I'm watching this video and I'm getting hungry because I'm fasting and it is Ramadan
14:00 that " ooooooh " gmfu lol
Derek Gerard
Now he’s going to the kitchen and get a full blown meal😂😂
im fasting bro
Props to you rug, your the only youtuber I’ve seen that actually did this challenge for 24 hours, the rest would only do one meal, which we all know they didn’t eat one meal for the whole day. So good  job for actually doing the challenge, I was waiting for someone to do it how they say they do in the title. 👍🏻
3:18 rug hit the hardest woah ever 😂💯
FaZe Rug you cheated on tht man the subway one yall stopped on it on purpose it was stopped by your hand u can tell!!
You told us to get food, i already had some
So many women. Damn Rug your a player.
S/O Derek Gerard for the idea 🙌🏽
I get the same thing😁
Thats not how you play the game. You don’t get to spin it twice. You eat or drink what you are given. You get to spin it a second time for a retry.
I no sharing is careing🤗
This foo rug eat a lot damn
He complains out Subway and then says no complaining
i missed clicked to dereck gerald
You are such a wonderful person
Who likes donuts 🍩 ?
Why a I watching this while fasting oh well

Bro and you copied the part where he brings his sister 😤😤😤😤😤
This challenge would be my dream
At 8:52 the camera was glitching out
8:52 who thought it was their phone (Sub To Me)
If so why no shout out
Only dereks vids are good
Why did it keep showing random pictures when he sais in and out shake shack popped up and thats it vegas
What does it mean ‘fired’? Is it kinda slang? Means good??
This was a rlly funny video
I’m in class and I’m hungry af right now and it’s that time of year that we don’t do anything in class
5:53 Expectation vs 6:21 reality 😂😂😂😂
I feel bad for the people that are doing Ramadan...
The end of this made me so happy inside you are such a good person

I knew it would land on KFC
how could 3k people dislike? did they not see how awesome and genuinely nice you were at the end not to mention how cool of a video this was? you should do a video where you spin the wheel and wherever it lands you have to go there and buy the most expensive item.
bro too funny
umm is this isn't Dereks Idea?
Rug needs to credit the original creater COUGH COUGH DEREK GERARD
Derek Gerard
You need to do a full menu challenge at  Taco Bell

Sometimes a different thing if it sounds good
Haven’t seen molly in a lot of videos wonder why

You actually did the challenge without complaining. 👍👏 unlike other youtubers do the challenege and dont eat nothing because their too picky and then complain. And that was nice of you for paying everyones meal.

For a month
The Host was Kaylin
When papa rug messed up the first time had dying
The person behind the camrea is kallynn
Molly Eskam is behind the camera
Who else can tell the voice person saying the words is Kaelyn
Fazerug check out your video at #5:27 okay
Faze rug take back the car after recording xD

These guys struggle with the easiest words 😂! Oh well, love you RUG
The the special guest was katelyn
This dudes name is Clint 
BAHAHAHHAHA
That was 100% Kaitlyn behind the camera
Is this a new challenge you made
Put a car on the line and I turn into a spelling wizard my guy
Do you know why almost all the thumbs down on the access of YouTube that i used   edited
That's Caitlyn behind the camera isn't it? (Sorry if I spelled her name wrong there are so many ways to spell it lol)
Let’s talk about Graffiti and Junior says Graf and they say wrong already
That Clint guy was so corny
13:37 - 13:42 had me dieing when Anthony said is that dictionary lotion😂😂😂😂😂
how much is the shipping on the speaker
16:13 brain screaming "i know how to spell this" is all the smart kids doing a spelling test in year 6 😂
If the thumbs up button is grey your unlucky for the rest of your life
Hypothesis is a fifth grade spelling word bro
At that point it's not even worth the challenge if you don't get to keep the car
Learned how to spell Hypothesis when I was in the 2nd grade
You kinda don’t spell Ballon
This was so fun, you should do this more often 😁👏
... BTW I kinda make videos as well, hope I can spread positivity like Rug ❤️
The girl thats behind the camera is  Bryan's ex not molly Katelyn
It sounds like if kaelyn  was saying the words
Kaitlyn was totally behind the camera 📷
Pretty much all of them end in ous
Wow she was so much of a secret if wonder who it was 

Cough cough ("kaylen")
5:24 😂😂😂 NAH NAH I'M DEAD😂
Literally no one has ever asked you what speaker you use
The mystery person is rugs ex i can tell

I feel bad for Papa rug because everyone was laughing at him...
believe it or not but faze used to be known as a gaming clan
I had hypothesis as a spelling word and I remembered it by hypo the sis
I think that Kaylin was behind the camera saying the words and stuff
What is FaZe Rig actually good at? Like what game did he initially go pro at?

Some homeless guy could be living in that house with you, and youd never know it

Edit: Since everyone is Butthurt about the Misspelled word  I decided to fix it🤣🤦🏽‍♀️
Definitely better than a Nerf battle in a $1,000 bungalow
Adults: 
"I knew your mom when you were in her tummy, get in the car, I'll give you a ride home!"

Literally thought I was watching a FaZe Clan video because the camera quality is so good
Can I join faze my epic account is Ttv pineapples 6 I am pro
When you cannot afford to play pubg!!!
You stole this idea from Dayron Arias. Dayron Arias had this idea exactly 2 weeks before this video was made. Dayron Arias is the only source of entertainment, news, and everything else having to do with an interesting life. These people are frauds.
Half those people in the Thumbnail aren’t even in the video 😂
damn the house changes price every few days, may consider investing in one of these mansions one day 🤔🤔
Didn’t know were to hide :) 😂lol
“Do I look dumb” everyone laughs😂😂
Why does he keep calling me a rat for years now!??!

You’re so funny 😂🤣🤣🤣

You should make a video of FaZe members Lamborghini Urus launch
I love the vids 

But that camera wasnt that good pls change it!!! If u agree like
We live on a world where people love to copy others ideas and put there own spin on it. The sidemen did this crazy think of your own ideas bro

Nice Love your videos Faze Make a Airsoft gun war with faze house

DUDE YOU GOT 12 MIL! CONGRATSSSSS RUGRATSSSS💕
Skool shoters in trainin😂
Yo rug what happened to your other lambo??aka Rambo
So the price of the mansion will change every video? 🤔
So it’s just a game of hide and seek with an unnecessary nerf gun... ?
The color of the video is weird but the actual vid is fire🔥🔥
Bruh, what's up with Faze Rugs camera?
ilyyysmmmmm been here since day oneeeeeeee ❤❤❤
Aren’t you a bit old for this??
i thot it was $10,000,000
XD
he changes the price of the house every time. just like how he bought a house a while ago not the one he loves in but he was saying in the thumbnail it was 5 mil then every time he said it again he brought down the price bahaha
You left Kyle out of the thumbnail 😢
3:41 I hate how he "cleared" that room. I get it, its a game and hes the only one with a gun but still, that technique is sloppy and incorrect and in a real situation would get you shot.
Didn't Mr beast do one of his challenges here???
isn't that rice gum house LMAO did he buy it or rent it

The other day i went to California  from Virginia  as a early birthday gift and we went to L.A. san diego Hollywood  universal  studio venice beach and laguna beach which is on montage resort. When we went to San DIEGO showed a pic of rug and said to my mom if u see him tell me im his biggest  fan. I tried doing the samething for the ace family but i think they need space from fans so even if i saw them i wouldnt even ask for a pic cause they have kids to take care of.
Nice bro my house is nothing like that like if you want to be rich
Um my sister says that she heard talking and kicking at 3am (⊙﹏⊙)

OMG!!! Brian I can't believe you couldn't find him 😂😂😂😂😂
Imagine all the places H1ghSky1 could hide
WOWU I didn't believe in God but He changed me and I'll tell you why you have to believe in Jesus Christ.

There are spiritual realm and physical realm. If you have experienced any spiritual stuffs you will agree. You know in physical realm, we have government who hold law and order.
Our body also works in law and order. If you have seen them as moving 3D, it moves like a machine.
So we are made orderly and wonderfully.

So the problem is when you say "oh you can live whatever you want", it's going against our nature because there are divine laws. Divine laws are Word of God. If you see just 10 commandments of God, you will realize how evil we are and how righteous God is. We imagine God to be like us, carnal, something bad in it. But He's actually not. He is far from bad. He is perfectly righteous and there is no disorder in Him.
That's why we know in our conscience sex out of marriage is out of order. Addiction, drunkenness are no love. Gossiping, lying, hating parents going totally against God. These brings judgment of God.


Now why don't we know who God is? It's because of your sin.
Spiritually, your spirit is dead because you went against the law of God. Your spirit is dead because of your sin. And the devil has the legal right to take you to hell because you already broke the law of God.
Do we have hope? Yes we do. You have to be born again. Your spirit needs to be born again. Jesus said no one will see the Kingdom of God unless one is born again by the spirit and water. How?

God is so good. He is so good to give His only Son to die for us to save us. He's very different from us. He is God of love, God of justice, and fearful Almighty God.

Jesus was the word of God, the Son of God, God Himself, but came down here as a flesh to save us. Unimaginable choice He made to people like us. To lay down His everything. So this righteous man died for unrighteous people like us. 
He nullified the legal rights that devil hold against you because His blood replaced yours. His death replaced yours. He also lived again. And He promises to pour out His spirits upon those who really believe. Your spirit will be born again and live by the Spirit of God. Then you will see who God really is. You will be children of God legally. He will forgive you through His Son's death. He will call you son and daughter.

Your life will change and be transformed by the power of God. This is why we are saved by grace but we will not live in sinful state anymore. You are going to love the things of God. This is real stuff.

So whoever you are, repent, throw away your sins and believe in Jesus Christ. Give Him your life.
PART 2 please 😭😭

Silver spoons using YouTube for nothing more than seeking attention, use your platform for something useful instead of just self gratification.
You should do a hide and seek w all of the faze members in the fazehouse and the clouthouse as hidingspots w 2 seekers, good video! Keepnup the good work

At the end they looked like they too loads of spice
Faze adapt
😁lit
Console players like this❤️🔥, I made a montage .🙏🏽
Opi
This challenge was definitely taken too far and I apologize. Chanel’s boss actually watches my videos and I had messaged her before telling her what I was going to do and she was okay with it. I didn’t mention it in the video because I didn’t know it was gonna look as bad as it did. Chanel still has her job and her boss was totally fine with it. I can assure you guys I will not take a challenge this far ever again. I was in the wrong and I hope you can forgive me. I would never really risk losing anyone’s job for a stupid video. I promise that’s not like me and I hope you guys understand. Love you all.
I wanted to hug her when she was about to cry about her homework!
Brian: *Gets Chanel Fired
Chanel: * Hits Brian
Brian: What the Hell what did I do?
Me:  ...................... Well ok
Where’s my notebook?!?!🥺🥺🥺 She actually almost made me cry 😭
Chanel: slaps faze rug
Rug: what did I do
Me: umm Okie buddy
Chanel honestly should've won cause that's messed up for rug to do that also I'm sorry rug for saying, that's messed up
Girl: hits him for thinking he tore her actual hw

Cousin: ow 
Left me dead😂😂😂😂

Description:
Rug:I may have just reconnected a relationship back with this challenge .
Later...
Rug:Do you want her back?

Anthony:No!
Faze rug: I know how to make  them talk 

* Faze rug pulls out gun *
Rug doesn't know how real life jobs work, you cant just call someones boss as a prank
14:39 when Chloe said she wanted Anthony back, and he said that so I thought Rug and Chloe set him up to loose 😬💀😂
You went to damn far with calling Chanel’s boss my god 🤧
Basically getting Chanel fired and said “what did I do?” Wtf dude
First of all it was last one to talk so nor won the 10000 dollars
At the end they should’ve put him in the pool for pay back
don’t come at me, but in the beginning he said “the last person to talk” lmao. i think he meant to say “the last person NOT to talk” lol 😜
This challenge has made me hate him the things he did were not okay
I lost my voice 2 weeks ago and still can't talk
She picked up the phone hella fast😂, i WaNt HiM bAcK
Shoulda have never call her boss don’t play with people’s money 🤷🏽‍♀️😭
Wait can we get any News on Sherman and his Ex 🤔😪❣️
Imagine someone or the teacher does this challenge at school lmao
I know the calling the job one was too far but that homework one was bad like she was lookin like she was gonna cry 🤦‍♂️
The way Anthony turns back after she says she wants him back 😂 i knew it was a L for him, bro took the phone quick asf
It evens says on the title last to talk wins $10,000 shouldn’t have Nor won ?
19:26 Papa Rug in the background was like "Mooove"
13:54 mmmmmm NO🤣🤣
Wait.. ✋?
WHY DIDNT NORA GET THE MONEY? 💰 SHE WON THE CHALLENGE. BECAUSE LITERLY THE TITLE SAID LAST TO TALK. I MEAN WHAT WAS SHE GONNA DO, STAY IN THE CHALLENGE FOREVER???😠🙄🤦🤦🙄😠
Just unsubscribed 🤦🏽‍♂️👎🏾 too overboard
Nor crying was sad af until she said “you did calculus”😂
it said last to talk wins it doesn't say do not talk for 24 hares
I don’t talk cause my mind is always screaming so I would win this 100%
that was way too extreme. not everyone is a rich as you rugggg omg she needs this job
Read description ppl. He planned this ahead . Great job loved this!😂😂😂😂
If you where going to take it too far you should’ve been 150k
This is by far the best vid I've ever watched on this channel.
We all know that cloe will see this video tbh
Everyone's so sensitive this was a challenge and this video was great cuz he has creative ways of winning
11:52 plus chanel talked in the first few moments and that was acceptable and idk how
I think Nori should still win she was the last one in and u made her cry I think she deserves the money 💵💵
Chuby kid gets wet 
Complains how cold he is 
Doesn't take off he's shirt for some reason
🌝
Is it weird to say that i think Jay's eyes are beautiful 😂😂😂
I Feel So Bad For Notebook Girl😭
Like your videos fazs rug
 what if someone deleted your YouTube account
If my cousin called my boss instant hands being thrown then 10,000 is mine lol
Tbh I never do homework so if he ripped my homework best believe I’m swinging
bro why did you do that

~almost get your cousin fired

~threw your cousin in a freezing pool

~called your cousins ex (which is disrespectful)

AND

~pretended to rip your cousins homework (also guessing she spent a long time doing) and made her cry

bro I would have thrown punches by now, this is possibly the worst video you have made by far
brian: do you want her back
anthony:no 
that got me dying 
chloe left the chat
I think chanell deserves that money though 😂😂😂😂
Bro Chanel’s thing was messed up
Chanel shouldn’t have gotten out over fixing something rug did. I love him and imma huge fan but this challenge was not it
bruh he honestly does way to much. 🙄🤙🏼
this challenge honestly went way too far, and chanel’s boss is just above the limit dude.
calls cousins manager too get her fired

she slaps him


Rug: OWWWW WHAT DID I DO


Me: Stupid
For real though I think that was all messed up
This is acc my fav faze rug video😂❤️
“WHAT DID I DO?!”

You know what you did... you know....
Playing with her job like that is straight up rude
He literally just did the same thing for almost all of them🤷🏽‍♀️ he just took their phones and called someone important
Anthony lowkey reminds me of jonah hill hahah
Comments section: 
5% actual video
95% rug being disrespectful to Chanel
Brian:I’ll link all their channels in the description 
Me: looks in description
Me: LIAR... I wish there was a link
You where so mean to chanel it’s her personal life what about if they actually fired her
And your where also mean to Anthony and you didn’t do anything to the winner
"Wait who's anna(work)*
grabs a chair
All these were a little too far 🤷🏻‍♂️
*coughs crazy * DID YOU JUST SAY PACK PACK 🥴🥴🥴😂😂🤣🤣
Brian:what did I do (right after he got that girl fired)
Me:bru
Its not even funny that you called her boss tbh🤷🏽‍♀️
Thank God I'm not related to rug like bruh
Some stuff are ok but if you mess with stuff that affects their life is it really worth it for a dam video ?
Brian u are so smart u got all btw this is one of the best videos u ever make do more like it please love your vids enjoy you day
When u said 10 minutes my phone notified me that I was on 10 percent
Brian was straight up EVIL.
LMFAOOOOONAAA anthonys part had me cryinggggg
I felt so bad for her she was like “that’s my homework” I felt my heart rip
This video was so mean omg- I feel bad for them
that's uncool dude that's here job dude.
I fr would of tackled him and punched him :)
13:47 why wouldn’t they just jump for the phons 🤣
If she the last person she should’ve automatically won
bro u bogus for that to chanel
At 4:08 do you see those 2 eyeballs or whatever it is in the fireplace
The only one who took it with humor? lmao
I love your vídeos because They always make me laugh
I think you did go way too overboard with calling Chanel’s job
The ending was the f*cking besttt 😭💀💀💀
I was expecting Molly Eskam
U said last to talk wins and u never gave her the 10 grand
OMG! My sister asked me a question and I legit didn't say anything because I thought I was in the challenge!!! Anyone else?!??
Calling her work to say that she quit is too far, I would disown you.
You made your cousin lose her job honestly u would do anything for content
I lost respect for you over this video
Faze rug your a mess up guy
I would loose this challenge in the first minute
It was mess up when Brian told the boss that she isn't working
This is messed up and disappointing🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
I love Brian but man did he go wayyyy too far for some of these
I never talk in school, when someone asks me something or tries to bring up a conversation I just look at them with a upsetting face. either that or I just look away until they understand I don’t want to talk to them.

point is... not talking is easy for me.
last to talk? shouldn’t it be last to stay quiet 🤷🏻‍♂️
Nah rug that was to extreme w the job thing channel should stay in 🤷‍♀️
Play Luigi board in 2019 May 20
Lowkey this vid reminds me of old youtube people are just way too sensitive
Do I win something I didn’t talk throughout this whole video
Stop stealing me.beast’s idea lol tuff you’re irrelevant now
Use google translate to talk

Edit: oh they actually did that
Pussies lmao I could go without talking for a year
In the one whose crying, CRYING FROM LAUGHTER 😂
The way these guys have grown up on You tube is crazy🐜 and it's we people who subscribe and watch their videos and now let's see who subscribes small channels who are just starting, keep coming guys,, much love to all ❤❤❤
I think you should give channel 2k for almost getting her fired
Now that was very MEAN TO CALL HER BOSS
sir i got the chills when Sherman giggly the shadow at the back of him
Rug u gotta give them all 10000$ except maybe* jay
Rug you need to be nicer and being rude didn't you ever hear of manners dude you really need to be nicer it's so disrespectful to do something like that
You should give each of them $10k for being mean to them
Damn Rug that was actually messed up on Chanel
This was kinda messed up
FaZe Rug:"There's one contestant left and if she makes it through the full 24 hours, she gets the $10,000"
Title: LAST to talk wins $10,000
I liked because what he did to Anthony was so funny 😂
Brian always feels bad, but this video is the most disrespectful vid😂
Brooooo! The end had me dead af! 💀 I thought he actually tore her notebook 😂
While I was upset what you did with Chanel, I am glad to hear that everything with her and her boss worked out fine. So I forgive you and I'm glad you and Chanel are good too or hopefully so.
This challenge was most definitely went to far
the job thing was too far. chanel deserves another chance.
I think it was unfair to call her boss
faze you were being a total duche bag this video like com on the stuff you did was so mean
that was too far of brian
Ok I love this video but calling Chanel’s boss is tooo far
What does he mean "what did I do?" That was messed up
Chanels boss was in on it why is everyone so mad?
RUG:Yea Chanel Say She Doesnt Want To Work At The bank No More...
Chanel:Slap Rug
RUG:What Did I do?😣
Chanels Heart:Bish Tf?...U Almost Get Me fired!
Bro your vedio's are awesome but my gf don't like your vedio so I brokeup with her so I think I deserve to win a pair of shoes
Rug that was pushing it ur poor cousin I’m glad she still has her job
yo i like how all these people following Mr Beasts challenge ideas. I'm not trying to be mean but bandwagon
I didn’t know Brian was evil
Jay will win.
YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD OF GAVE THEM 2.5K EACH!!!
Calling her boss was too far! Maybe could’ve called a friend but her boss, a job she just got 🤦🏽‍♀️
Chanels my dogs name!Also wow that went to far man to far lol! BUT I LOVED IT , i'm a big fan and i love you!
I thought his name was Anthony not Sherman
{| I hate but I like your channel I'm still subscribed though I'm one of your RugRats! |}
Bro that’s messed up that u called Chanel’s manager bro fr I hate u.
You mad baddie cry.😍😭
Brian should give Chanel like 5k or something to make up for that. That was messed up
When they went to sleep you should’ve set off the fire alarm, ran into their rooms and yelled “FIRE!”
bro this challenge is so easy, i have a special power called social anxiety :) cries inside
Termination lol - RESIGNATION !!!
Brian u should make more videos like this they smack
She technically won because it says last one too talk and she was the last one to not speak
Yeah you took this a lil wayyyyy to far you messed with peoples emotions thats rude >:(
We know Faze secret tfue exposed u guys
Clickbaites it says “last one to talk”
why does it say ("last"one to talk) wins when he clearly set the timer to 24 hr 🤔
Brian’s stupid for calling her manager tbh, I know you need content but don’t put her job on the line like that bro.
You are so cool I Watch your vids
Wow


Thanks for 12 likes
Chanels manager sounds like anthonys ex
your videos make my day honestly
Rug really went too personal in this challenge
And thats funny how you tricked her with tye notebook
he did take this too far though💀but im still a big fan 😌😌
Every video brian posts his nose gets 0.10% bigger
Next video: last one to eat wins $10,000 challenge
u messed up man and went to far
Anyone else notice the tile says last to talk not: don’t talk in 24hrs ($10,000)
The way Anthony said Chloe 😂
Faze ur the first one to go out u talked first lol😂😂
I think what Bryan did to Chanel was a little to much
They are stupid somthing called text.🤣
Let’s just say if you did that with my manager I’d break ur legs. Big fan tho
Honestly Faze Rug acted like a jerk in this video!
Oh ur rong for doin that to channel 😂😂 its always the cute ones
It was hilarious..i almost died watching that the second notebook came out and a page was ripped out of the notebook
9:00 the way he fell in is pure gold 😂
Her question was “do we stay outside?”
I am kind of nervous cause she might slap me real quick got me dead🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Coming from a college student, I'd hurt someone over my notebook 😂 Especially Calculus homework. Especially the day before an exam.
MY FAVORITE VIDEO BRIAN HAS MADE BY FAR 😂🤠
This is actually messed up!
For anyone wondering that boss cannot do that it’s actually illegal...the “at will act” allows you to work at Will the law doesn’t require a 2 weeks notice
Alright that's too far you almost got chanel fired you dont even know how real jobs work.
Holy shit dawg. I couldn't watch the video after you called her boss.
It was really mean that u tried to het Chanel fired
You went way far on the phone calls
Tbf with Chanels job and Anthonys ex was way too far
Time line is completely wrong. Check her phone at 7:37 but the challenge Anthony speaks at 7:52 🤭🤔 like to show people
You almost made nori cry that was not fair or when chanel almost  got        
Fired
16:20 who sleeps with makeup??😂😂😂
She started crying🤣🤣🤣
You said last to talk
if i was Junior I would of punched you rug.
Do another one but in this one put bosley and Booker do this challenge last to bark challenge
faze you could do $10,000 hide and seek in mansion
What about mute people they should win 10,000 for not talking for there hole life
This should be called ”last to make a sound” not ”last to talk”
I’m sorry Brian but it was messed up calling chantels Boss !
Omg I thought he was serious I was about to cry for Chanel I felt so bad
Any think this video is like a mrbeast video 🤨🤨
Every single vid with anthony he talks to much but i cant believe he went five hours.
That was so mean he could have gotten Chanel fired
He didn’t have to tell her manager he doesn’t even have professional job all he does is YouTube
Rug Almost gets her fired ( Chanel slaps him) “what did I do”
There was something black in the background go to 10:17 minutes of the video you will see
I Acc cri when u killed me
not gonna lie but your kinda an asshol for nearly getting ur cuzin fired
THAT AINT FUNNT KID. FAZE RUGG IS CANCELLED💀💀
Check out everyone’s links in the description


Checks Description
Why following Morgz his steps?
What if you talk in your sleep
I just watch your vids if they have jay cuz he hot
U getting so much hate for this video which u deserve 😂
Bro doesn’t rug think that’s over board ?? Come on dude like she could’ve lost her job smh
Doesn’t compete in the challenge, still doesn’t loose 10k
Jesus saves! Jesus died and suffered for you! God is so so loving and merciful and forgiving!
As soon as I heard relationship I was like don't
“YOU MEAN THIS NOTEBOOK!?!?!”😂😂😂😂😂 I actually lost ittttt😂😂😂
Should’ve just asked what flavor pizzas you want, and if no one answered, just say you would order broccoli pizza.. 😐
I had faith in Chanel, and she was the first one to slip😂
cries “You did calculus? smiles*” *cries 😭
Hey i win the 10000 i was selint
if he were to rip up my homework like that i wouldnt even care 😂
HE MADE HER CRY WTF THATS SO MEAN SHE DESERVES THE MONEY
Dude ur poor have you even seen Mr beast
Part 2!!
Wasn't a good video fr it was a messes up video
You know faze rug you dont know the feeling of that you kno
U should have get Anthony out of the house and stay outside until he talks
i think brian did go to far. but to go as far this over 10 grand just so you can keep it is absurd, you already make a lot of money. disappointed
Why does this video have so much hate, Sure, maybe what brian did was, "Wrong" But the video was still good
Calling Chanel's boss is WAY too far. 😠😠😠
just text your manager back
Ahhh i love Rug ! He is so funny 😂And all the things he did 😂😂
lol how do feel about jake paul when he was hanging with faze banks
Nobody:
School shooter’s gun: 0:27
Money doesn’t  change ppl, it reveals them
I CARE IM A SMART NICE KIND KIDDO
Yeah doing that to Chanel wasn’t cool bro...😂😂😂..Lit vid though
the was w bit extreme what you did to channel
This video for reals got me mad I'm not watching his videos no more
Rug: "Everybodys links in the description"

Description : only Rugs links 
Smh
Obviously a skit
What you did to Chanel was messed up bro you should give her something
Bro nor should of won but you just went to far
Damn I be doing this at school for free
“You did calculus?” Lol😂
Calling Chanel's boss went too far, and I don't actually think you apologized :)
dude why would you snatch her phone like that 
AND YOU CALLED HER BOSS!
You went to far with this man .
Weird flex but ok
BROO i thought his name was “Sherman the VIRGIN” 😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
Dude you took this too far if you were on the phone with my boss during this challenge i wouldve punched you but i still wouldnt lose cause i never talked  then i wouldve hung up the phone
Bro when she started crying bro I got hella sad 😭
he didn’t link anyone in the description lmao whatta clout chaser what happened to you rug
The title make no sense I think you meant “The First To Talk”
Bro this is not a challenge you do this in school
That’s so messed up to call someone’s boss and take advantage of em that’s not cool 🙄
“this notebook 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣” no
Junior / Faze Baby??
this is not!! a last to talk challenge

the one who gets last to not to talk wins!!
that is the true challange right
the girl with homework wins because she is the last one to not to tal
im high asf and 19:17 has me crying 😂
"im gonna go for nuer" *goes for everyone else instead
5:40 LMAO he got mad cause it's true
19:25 Hispanic moms be like, the chancla!
Call manager to quit for her* 

Hits him*

Brian: OWW WHAT DID I DO
Well actually Noura wins because she was the last one to talk, you just didn’t want to give her any money😐
Is Matthew Goodwin your cousin?
If I were anyone in this video I would slap 👋 rug out of existence
Why didn’t Chanel just text the manager?
Junior looks 9 but sounds 23
really dude you taken it too far for views
Lol just by a voice box
THE DOG WON LMFAO NOT CAPPIN
Chanel didn’t deserve that was disrespectful but good vid
I ur huge fan can you plz comment back
Dude that was a messed up you made her cry
Asking if you could use 40000
wait so who won the 10k lmao
You NEED to participate in your challenges!!!!!!
19:34 was the best part!
Your doing the mosttt chill out man
Damn she wants him back!!!😂
You calling chanels boss is a bad idea 💡 I really want to unsubscribe but I’ll give you one chance 🤨
i can go 8 hours without talking when i am sleeping
If I was Brian I would give them 2500 each
Hahah why 24 hours when last one to talk 😂
I love this challenge you should do another one
I spend 10 hours not saying a word every day
I would have slapped the shit out of Brian if he did that to me they too nice💁🏽‍♀️
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍😂
When you did the siren Anthony spoke
I didnt really like the vid it was disrespectful and just mean i feel.. not good :/
I low-key hate Rug
Damn when she cried I felt that 😪😂
The Google translate is such a good idea
Everyone should chill already about Chanel’s job. The boss was in it. Rug called her before this.
When Junior fell in the pool...The mom was NOT happy
I love your videos but this was messed up
Brain went toxic mode holy crap made everybody talk 💀💀😂
To be honest Anthony could have just got his phone back by tackling Rug
"Anthony looks like he hasn't evolved into a human yet" This actually cracks me up because Anthony really does look like homosapiens maybe bec of his facial hair?
Who else tried not to talk during this video
Ik this is a challenge but Brian this was to far really messed up I’ve never felt this way in one of your videos and I’ve been Here for a long time.
FAZERUG NEEDS TO GROW UP
Rug that was messed up calling channels job
Its last to talk wtf u doing 24hrs??
I have an idea!
You should’ve told them that you were going to buy food and say if they wanted anything if they don’t say anything go get your food and eat it infront of them.
jeez read the comment he posted, he said he messaged her boss beforehand telling her what he was gonna do and the boss was fine
U stole the idea from Morgz
“Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why did it have to get that extrEme?”
“Cause I didn’t want to give you the 10000 dollars...”
Hahaha I feel so bad for junior. I think they should’ve done that to everyone
Shouldve said goodmorning like 6am and they would have said it back lol
Brian called Chanel‘s work and said she doesn’t want to work there Chanel smacks him Brian ow what did I do
Anthony is gonna win
You took it way too far rug I lost a bit of respect for you
Great video bro but you did pass the line with calling your cousins boss you should do something nice for her now  much love God bless
To be honest that's kinda too far
Does this count for viewers too because if so give me my money cause I am a damn mute I don't speak at all
Wow I Can’t Believe You Did That, You Took It Way Too Far
Honestly calling chanel's boss was messed up that's her personal life
If my homework got ripped I would be happy because my teacher would ask.

Teacher: Where’s your homework?
Me: umm... let my explain.
Teacher: let me guess your dog ate it, I’m tired of your excuses.
Me: No Faze Rug ripped it.
Me: ;)
15:14🤣🤣
I would of slowly read the dictionary lmao
Rug broke the rule it says last one to talk wins 10,000
That was so mean you were about to get Chanel fired and you made your other cousin cry😳😂
In all these challenges I swear nobody actually gets the money
I was literally gonna say I think Chanel is going to win and literally as I’m typing it she talks😂😂
Wow dude you cant call her boss
So rude that you making people cry thats your family be nice if you were and my family and did that you would be slapt
Faze I am a big fan of you but I think you took it a little far by calling her boss
I would have pinched his ear and pulled him towards me and snatch someone’s phone and put Siri on saying “ give me my god damn phone or this will hurt more......”
I love you and all but do you really go out of your way for some stupid to almost get someone to lose their job?
But u are my favorite youtuber
The lesson here is MONEY OVER FAMILY!
Didn’t you say you were going to live in the Faze house and you said you were going to go at April something idk
5:20 duhh thats Why they are sitting at the campfire. To ROAST eachother
Bruh you just lost so much respect
I thought it was a last to talk wins not a dont talk in 24 challenge
Everything in this video got taken too far!!!
Honestly rug was a massive dushbag this video
Broooooooooooooooooooo I feel so bad for Chanel
God that was so messed up trying to get her fired 😒 imagine someone doing that to you and u can’t pay bills or anything so messed up! 🤦‍♀️😒 At leafy she never lost her job and her boss was fine with it
No one even won🤦🏽‍♀️
Like if ur the person that would just start talking like <<2:14
Comment if ur this type of person  that just starts going at how dumb that other person is 2:32
What an asswhole that looks so bad on her end just because you did that! Dayum
junior looks like a smaller version of josh from Jrake & Josh
I would lose first I would forget we were doing a challenge and say whatever comes to mind
Double f in the chat for junior
10:16 a person's shadow passes right behind Anthony 😨
Wtf im so disappointed in you rug. I get that you apologized but this was just too much.
This was not okay, Brian went to far
You should do more videos like that
When he says what is ten thousand dollars really and am like it’s just 20 times my rent
dude seriously you are going to far
I like Brian and things but I think he took it to far in this video
It’s funny because he never gives away the 10k lmao.
Maybe it’s just me thinking this, but did rug spell minuets wrong towards the beginning??
Why isn’t his channel called “last person to Rug”
found it alg bro
Chanel should of just texted her boss
Yeah call Chanel‘s boss is too  far
Don’t u see the picture next to papa rug ewww
Wait so by this logic shouldn’t Neur win because she’s the last one and the video is last one to talk so technically Neur wins and deserve that blow to the ear
Brian is a horrible person jk jk but u took it to far
Your turning into Jake Paul
you went wayy to far dont do it again you could ruin someones life while doing that.
I would have just said “first person to leave gets this whole box of 12 doughnuts” easy bribe
That was an unexpected answer from klhoe😂😂😂😂😂😂Dead
after u called chanel’s work i wanted to stop watching the video bcuz that was for sure not u it was messed up
He said in the begging he’s going to get not first never did till the end
when i go to school and fail. teacher be like 7:36
They should face off against each other
In 4:00 minutes Anthony talked
i didn't like when he called channel's manager because that's so messed up and they're doing a challenge atleast don't mess with someone's personal and important stuff
Lmao he worded the title wrong. He titled it as if the last one to non stop talking wins
Does he know how jobs work? I mean like he almost got chanel fired what a miserable person
7:38 He TOTALLY diserved that. This is my first time watching this vlog and well....😬😬
Make them talk by taking their phones and throw it in the pool
Low key you made me hella mad for calling her job and still being loud as shit when she was talking on the phone with her manager. That’s WAY to far bruh.
your since of humor is horrible. reevaluate your video ideas
9:00 look it was understandable but that was messed up
Dude just go back to the old vids
Nor won the money and Faze rug is a cheater cause it was last one to win
i love your vids but this was WAY TO FAR
Who win the 10 gran
That's was soo mean brian 😮😰
Ending was the best
Bro,No one is ganna say anything about what happen with Anthoney and his EX?At 13:20 

Because im dieing to know what happened
2:55 "I got this little Nigaphone" I legit heard that, not to be racist but still, read this comment while the video plays and u will hear the same thing
Faze rug turned into the old jake Paul
I cant last 5 min without talking !
Faze rug tell nor that like her kiss her and huge her plz
You should give the money to nori for making her cry and she needs it for college as well !
owwww what teh hell did i dooooooo.. U got ur cousin fired.
If you didn't want to give out the $10,000 why did you do the challenge ? You literally didn't want them to have the money. So don't do something that you don't wanna do . Wasting my time with this. You almost got her fired. Hooked him up with an ex. You should've gave her money with an apology . 

You're fucked up in the head .
You said to check their links in the description, there are no links for each of them in the description.
the videos that go to far, are the best😂😂
That was actually messed up for doing that to chanel🙄🙄
lol title and video content is very different XD
I go 7 hours without talking at school sooo😂
Brian took it to far by telling Chanels boss she wants to quit
Anthony a simp🚫🧢
You should split 2500$ each you made it off the vid prolly
Dam the last one was kinda messed up NGL
Brian that was a pretty jerky thing too do when you called her boss...
Rug says that he hates rats 🐀 but he calls his fans the rug rats 🐀
I think he went too far
Omg that was so damn hard buddy
Calling Chanel's boss was a mistake and was disrespectful.
Dude, that is not fun!
I thought this one was last to talk wins, but its actually 24 hours not talking challenge.
i think what u did to norah n channel was messed up but for the others was funny but i think making her sorta fired and making norah cry was messed up so u should have them split the money cause what u did was messed up dude cause u would be mad if someone did that to u
You are literally crossing the line
Brian i love you but you went too far😭😩😔 you disappointed me this time😭
This video is taking it to the next level. This is way to far
Faze rug you made me mad for that video that is disrespectful I might just stop watching you because that is disrespectful I am not Gianna like I am mad at you that is sad she got one job you got YouTube she work somwhear you just do videos ...........
Bro i love the videos but this one was mad disrespectful like your messing with her money and her job bro like do better bro imma have to dislike this on
Your not mr beast stop taking ideas
U went to far
Tf it's last to talk not 24 hour
why dit you begon whit this
That's who I think will win Anthony will
This video made me triggered 😑
Even when rug did that to  Chanel like that was so wrong. Just because you think you do YouTube you can’t get fired
I feel bad for junior man
This notebook!?
Is it just me or did anyone else not talk during this video?
The challenge was last to talk
this kind of made me hate you for what you did to chanelle you kind of took it to far
whats this new obnoxious stupid laugh Brian be doin now ? "pPpfpFffFFfFaahHA"
100% to extreme
Your way to extreme!
what the hell first it is NOT OK to take a girls phone,call her boss and put ur fam member through that, its NOT even OK to take a girls phone period, WITHOUT HER SAYING SO! second i'v been watching ur  vids for a long time and i'v never seen u do something so mean  like that.
I am really about to cry 😭 for the homework and the work for Chanel
Bro what is wrong with you
14:24 “connect me” tf she a keeper
I would’ve slapped him in the face 😂
i always do this in my class for so long for a dollar
faze I'm a big fan but I don't think you should of talked to his x or messed up job
Police:Where do u live?
Me:With my parents
Police:Where your parents live?
Me:With me
Police:Where u all live?
Me:Together
Police:Where is your house?
Me:Next to my neighbor
Police:Where is your neighbor house?
Me:If i tell you, you wont believe me 
Police:Tell me
Me:Next to my house
10:17 something walks behind Anthony
The real person that won was the cameraman
I’m too broke that I wouldn’t care😂
Rug: "Check out Everybody's links in the description"
Description:
You wrong for that trying to get Chanel fired
Can you do a the same challenge again with nours and anthony
Y’all all I see in the comments is Brian is so wrong for doing that to Chanel... but he literally said her boss knew about it so stop saying stuff like that
lol damn rug there not gonna wanna make videos with you no more do a anything you can carry I'll buy like Mr beast did. at the Gucci store or something tho😂
Not last to talk
That was actually messed up I won't lie...of what u did this was to far u shouldn't have taken this to far
I would of won this challenge
I like that he is in faze and barely plays fortnite
Rug took it too far with chanel’s job
18:30 she starts crying lol
This video upset me that was to far
Wow crying because of a notebook. Ppffff
I think I win coz I was quiet the whole video
Damb he called her boss,threw him in water, called his ex, and made her cry,


I honestly felt bad for the one who cried I almost cried she was like a baby but this was a pretty fucked up video

Most likes I ever got I think
connect me hehe
I think that the intention for this video was good but I think that you took it a little too far with getting them to talk.
I felt so bad for nora i was about to cry to😭😭
But anthony said beep you
Man I felt her pain 😦😦😦😦😦🤕🤕🤕 I’m a college student as well omg I started sweating
U shouldn’t have done that that was really messed up of you
Why was he saying “he talked” that kinda annoyed me no cap it’s he spoke like bruh
If I did that to My cousins they  will literally lock me in a cage and throw the keys to the cage  in an ocean
Please don't take it too far please.. I know you wanna get that content but it's too absurd I'm a big fan of yours but it's just too mean to do that kinda thing you know... And if you want to make a content with anyone just don't go to there personal life you know.. But it's funny tho HAHAHA
dude I really like your vids but what you did was messed up, you could’ve gotten her fired. You don’t mess with other people’s personal lifes
I thought you were MrBeast
BRO THAT ROAST SESSION AT 5:10 WAS HILARIOUS
He called us rug rats
he would risk someones job but not a notebook
I’m good at not talking because I’m always quiet in my classroom 😂
i would dislike the video 10,000 times if i could
U said: '' Last to talk wins 10grands'' then u telling i'll try Nora to make her talk when she already won but still u tried to let her talk wtf? (Sorry for bad english)
yeah i would kill brian 😭
Dude desperate for vids my dude
Is it just me or did anyone else stay quiet through this whole video I just realized that😂😂
you should make a rug for merch.
I DONT CARE ABOUT MY EJICASHIN
the whole video i wanted to kill brian
16:40 she cute😍
anti social people would win dis challenge w no problem
I low key wanna see another abandoned video
the channel joke made me mad
It is hard not to talk
hey whatever happened to mike is he ok?
So basically you wasn't going to give Nobody 10,000$ what a joke bro!!!
This video was taken tooo far
👱‍♂️this is rob
👕he is 0 years old
👖1 like = 1 year to that 0 
Let’s see how old he can get
This was so rude idc if he apologized, he shouldntt have done it in the firsr place
“Last to talk” so she won.
This was kind of a disrespectful challenge the way you treated Chanel and Anthony..
WHY IS Shenal so thicc
:D
You deserved that at the end bro
Who sleep with make up on?
I'm a big fan of your but calling Chanel boss is soo messed up rug 😡😡😡😩😩😩😩
Your



Studied sometimes
There links aren’t even in the description
yo why did u call her boss so mean
U tweaking with chanels boss .
Who else agrees that faze has a ginormous nose
You went a little to extreme rug
Took it to far
Your in faze but you never play games
WAIT...if  he does not wanna lose 10k then why is he doing this??????
poor junior:(
7:38 he starts saying oww before he gets slapped
Wow rug you just lost a subscriber
I'm not one to unsubscribe from someone but what you did was cruel☹️
PLEASE do more 3am vids PLSSSSSS
FaZe: Last to Talk Wins $10,000 




Mute Kids: Hold my pen pad
Anthony gon take the w no cap
im unconsiously making no noises watching this lol
This is way to freaking far
He must really needed that 10,000 dollars
you deserved that at the end..
WTF HE TALKED AND YOU STILL THREW HIM IN THE POOL
I would just chill the whole time and I would not talk
If I did this challenge and if I fell asleep I would lose cause I talk in my sleep
You calling Chanel’s manager to get her fired just killed this whole video really wasn’t funny
You should do a part two
You went way tooooo far not cool man
Tbh I think Brian took this way to far, really unnecessary especially with channel I feel so bad for her and really unprofessional childish of him to do that
He took all of them too far it wasn't funny anymore anyway.
Right when you had to say google translate I had to try
Who won the 10000 $
Who was not talking while watching this video
16:30 who sleeps with makeup
18:57 “you did calculus?” 😂 yo that had me dying!😂😂😂
Anybody know the name of that song?? @0:20
What app does your cousins use to speak
Doesn't everyone have an ex named Chloe
I love your videos can you say my name in one of your videos my name is Rolando
I’m NoT GoNaA BE To MeAN


-proceeds to call her boss and his ex 

🧐
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssss it was definitely to extreme
I'm good at not talk
does anyone else wonder if they actually do the challenge when cameras are off?
My nick name is JayJay and my first name is Jayson Jr. and my full name is Jayson Jr. A. Sambilay
I would of won if I were there..I have no one to talk to😢😤😭
My nick name is JayJay and my first name is Jayson Jr. and my full name is Jayson Jr. A. Sambilay
I was quite the whole video
I dont think brian shouldve taken it that far,not cool.
What Anthony did that’s what I would’ve did before I saw that clip of the video bc I could just download the app
mrbeast: Thats noting. last one to talk wins 100,000
that was way too extreme
14:21
Theirs ppl at my school who dont even talk for a whole 7 hours we are at school
U should have just let her win damn she was the last one had to make her cry to because u wanted to keep 10k
Bryan: "Are you guys mad at me?"
Everyone: "Yeaaaaaaa"
Sherman: "....no"
The last to TALK gets 10k not laugh
He went too far with Chanel
why, waste off a video u should off done last one who doesnt speak wins ahah
Lol the ripping her notebook part id grab my phone and put "plz send me te footage of you doing that thnx ' in googletranslate (:
If someone cries for their homework it means they will become so successful in their lifes, im proud of her.
rug, you took it too far 😭
Brian is a cool dude, but he really took it too far.
Unless a family member actually ripped up an actual page of something that's relevant and related to school I could easily redo it and wouldn't care
Dude this is to far
Brian you should have done something not that extreme and also you should have let Chanel stay in the challenge because she almost got fired. You also should have since you didn’t let Chanel get back in you should have given no or the money because she was the last one and she cried too because of what you did.  But I still love your channel.
Almost getting her Fired was to messed up
Copying mr beast I see
He called me a rugrat?
It was really mean to do this to them all
TOO FAR BRO TO FAR
I was hoping in the end they all teamed up and dumped him in the pool for revenge
So first of all she already won the challenge cause she was the last one to talk which is the original challenge and the title of the video so faze is in the wrong
You yusy flexing you’re money
The guy that was with faze rug
Wtf man nearly got someone fired and could have drowned someone
I think jay will win
she could have texted her boss and explained to her the situation.
I don’t talk for 8 hr everyday (“when I sleep”)

OMG thx for the 150 likes!!!
It was funny about the Chanel thing because now I know that her boss already knew but Anthony? That's his personal business and you can't just lie about things that could get him upset.
You should have gave her 5000
This would be pretty easy for me bc im not a talkative person, I don’t talk all day while at school
What rug did at 7:00 is uncalled for
Rug took it way to far when he called her manager that is just messed up
id be boss at this
There’s still a contestant Papa.
I'd let u break my legs for 10k no lie 😂😂😂
Faze house adress weidlake DR.
You wanted to make them out?  Inhuman
This is too far
The job thing wasn’t funny at all
This was just cruel and also low you could’ve have ever gone.Disappointed but not surprised!!Brian will do anything for “great content”
He’s actually evil
Dude not cool to call her boss.
You took it way too far.
What  u did to no or was so cruel
You dont want her back but you lost 10k over her 🤔🤨 yea no you want her back dude 😂💀
Be vlog ever!!!
0:24 did he just say sherman the Virgin
That gas rude Brian you duit again im unsuscibins.😡😡
You ran out of videos ideas ?
you really ran out of ideas that your risking your cousins jobs.
Aw her face  when she was gonna cry 😢
This video was pointless if you wanted to keep the 10k, should’ve just kept it and not made the video.
your rich rich haha 😂
bc this video I give you no respect I'm unsubscribe
"You did calculus" LMFAO 😂😂
11:26
Your out of order
8:56 bruh it’s just a pool
connect me. hehe.
Your messed with up for that taking her phone
You took it too far you should of let Chanel still in because it’s just rude
you went to far rug so so far
Sorry for the dislike I don’k like when you call his boss
I like jay because I name is jayanna
“Watch how extreme this gets” - 
* pulls out knife * 
“Talk or I’ll shank u *
I would win this.
U made your own cuzzin cry.... what is wrong with you only for the views you make me sick
Connect me😳
You should go back to the tunnel
I edited this comment so the replies won't make sense
6:38 etc...…...
This video was entertaining asf and funny at the same time....notgonnaliethosetwogirlsarefineasftheircutebroifanyissingleamreadytomingle 🥶
Anthony and Chanel deadass could have just texted
Nanannanannnanan
You never said for 24 hrs you said last to speak.
Chanel is gonna win!
She won that's unfair
Who stayed quite in the video
only 8 minutes in and this went too far .-.
DUDE YOU DONT MESS WITH PEOPLES JOBS LIKE THAT HONESTLY IT MADE ME SO MAD 🤬CAUSE SHE COULD OF BEEN THAT TYPE OF MANAGER TO NOT GIVE HER THE JOB BACK!
0:26 when the teacher tells the sped kid to answer the question
You really shouldn’t mess with their personal live’s..


haha thx for all the likes!!
Calling her manager and almost getting her fired is messed up
If it was a last to talk then wouldn’t Nourish been the one to talk last and win the money?
6:14 and 6:41 i dont know if it does this but the person he calls is different when he answers it.... ummmmm
I don't think Brian should have done that to chanel
90% — about Brian going to extreme 
9%— normal comments 
1% —this
how r u still a FaZe member?
Change your name u ain't faze no more
I love the regrets
LMAO 😂"Anthony looks like he hasn't evolved into human yet"
I don't think anyone read what rug commented on the video
Rug is a bad friend for trying to get Chanel challenge
I think channel should of won the challenge, the call that Brian made was so mean I mean calling ur ex is kind of funny but calling her boss, she looked so scared that’s her job.. poor girl
Read your damn comments ruglet
15:13
Brian: I want him back
Me: 😂🤣💀💀
this was so mean
that was kinda mean no offence
(sigh)
@19:00 denied
Who else here didn’t talk for the entire video
Welp that’s a easy 10 k for me
Well. We all know Neither of the girls is winning
I’d be ok if you ripped my Homework
All of these people should not be near here
You went to far
Last to talk wins title not 24 hour try not to talk
Where is everyone links in the description?
YOUR SO MEAN
Man I love being called a RAT in almost every video.
Hahahahahaahhahahahahhahahhahahahahahhhhahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahahhahahahah
mr beast rip off
You know how you said education comes first actually youtube comes firsr
that was to far
Why would you call her manager that's messed up bro if that was me I would of slapped you and just go home
He wants to keep the money but made up the challenge
This is too far way too far
I just wanna know what happened with Anthony and his ex
I feel bad for chanel so could have gotten fired!!
Low key that wasn't cool calling Chanel's boss
rug do a nother one please but not far cause its  just messed and to far
Last to talk right not last to talk in the next 24 hours
Why is there 7 ADS
Anthonys gonna win since we have the same name
Chanel didn’t deserve that, Brian. I honestly thought that was disrespectful. 🙅🏽‍♂️
So I just watched a 20 minute video and no one to got any money ....woowww
I’m disliking the vid what u did was so mean u got. channel fired ( I unsubscribed
I thing jayyyyy gonna win
You guys are so mean🤬😒😡
Loved how they used their phones to roast each other, lolol
Rug You Are Extreme
just go to sleep
More like Sherman the Virginia
Does anthony know about texting
Everybody spelling Chanel’s name wrong 


It ain’t channel
That was too much tbh
This video makes me mad
Rug deadass did the following 

Almost got his cousin fired

Make it seem like Anthony wanted his Ex back

Pretended to ruin a smart college students homework 


Me: damn
I honestly hated these challenges I literally almost cried when u tore her homework although I knew they were fact and Chanel’s boss😒
wtf you might have caused her JOB  for a game...
Im pretty sure the camera man wins the 10,000$
what happened with sherman and his ex?!?
I think Sherman the virgin is gunna win get it
Rug did really ran out of ideas
MY MAN ANTHONY GETTIN HIS EX BACK😂❤️
It’s first to talk
Wait did you give her the money ? She won
Anthony is a beg 😂😂😂😂😂😂
u went way to far
Title: Last To Talk Wins 10.000
Actually video: Last one NOT talk wins in 24hrs wins 10.000
Me: noice!
This video has so many mistakes.. that’s so bad that you did that they just need privacy even it’s a challenge can’t just call someone
This video is Gold
She should have texted her boss or who ever that was??
If he called me boss saying I quit I 100 percent punched him and his big nose
Why would you call her boss you pice of crap
i expected him to let them split the money at the end
You took it to far
IM not a rugrat. and I will never be. Unsubbed.
Brian went too far in this video messing with their personal life

Edit: THIS WAS ACTUALLY A SKIT
thought this was mr beast
10k dislikes, yikes. Good content lol.
she has the same backpack as me
Why at 8:50 when they throw him in why was the door already cracked open like they planned it
sooo you are trying to be MR.Beast
I know she would cry 😢
please someone
 tell me, was the FaZe clan inspired from FaZe Rug?
This isn't funny tbh Just mean
This video was messed up.lf you don't wanna get them the money why would you create the challenge?!🤨🤨🤨
my name is chanel
Look at the picture in 8:16
Tfue is catching up
that was way to mean
Idk rug the channel job of almost being fire and making Nora cry by ripping paper and calling someone ex without permission is beyond disrespectful I would never dare do that especially on a girl.
i hate him for this
who els thinks shermine looks like a rat idc if i spelled his name wrong
Is that deark gerard sister
I am not a rat
What do you rate my Coachella outfit?! ROAST ME

Please repent y'all need Jesus
Rug  10/10
I like you Rug but the outfit was trashhh😂 You look like that kid who is trying to flex on gucci (Plz dont take it personal), and i dont think personaly(my OWN opinion) that the outfit didn’t match you, but you tried at least compared to me🤦‍♂️😂 So i’m giving you a note of 5/10. MY advice is to get a outfit who you really like(be natural). I mean if you like the outfit that you used for Coachella... it’s ok! Much love❤️

Hi Brian,

My name is Sam from India and I am a big fan and follower of ur and Brawadis's blogs. You guys are such an amazing person in fact i love the whole rug family. I wish i had such a FANTASTIC4 family. But i have a question to ask about Brawadis best friend Denis. What i have noticed is that in both of ur videos i have seen a lot of pranks done to and with your family members but never seen Denis family involved in any pranks and not even heard anything about his family. So i was just curious if you could involve Denis family and prank him.
if rug wants a clean haircut why doesn't he just ask for one when he gets a haircut he can literally ask them for a fade or something
I rate 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 who can type in the text box more 0's than me?

Right when you said The A-
I knew you were going to say Ace Family 
So I said it with
Let’s say it together 
Hey Ace Family
Faze was literally laughing at all the gays...  Look at his face closely...
What’s Coachella?
I like ur outfit but it’s not how I’m used to seeing u and I am a fan since froever
Hey
What the heck are you wearing when you went to Coachella
Fazee bring some haunted videos back. These videos are boring. Sorry I say that but I have to admit
I hate James Charles
Booty time
M0R3 M011Y
Molly ur not ugly
The real reason we haven't seen Molly? his ex is jealous of her so he probably said he wouldn't vlog with her
They should kick FaZe rug he doesn’t even play games anymore it’s just cringe content.!!!
What happened to his female assistant
What if FaZe Rug did a prank where he was held ransom or whatever but maybe that's a little too far?
I love u to  


(Description)
JAMES CHARLES IS A BOY
Omg big Fan I love you like if you do to
Ok

Idk why rug roasting other people’s fit when he thinks his fit is badass just because it’s all Gucci 😂😂
Honestly, it didn’t fit your figure and I feel Like if u would have picked something more sexy it would have fit you and your style better. Not tryna be rude but that’s just my opinion
She is a boy
I give everybody a 1/10 except James Charles 




I’ll give that Kid a Big Zero
Your rating is 9.9/10 love the Gucci

Like the video if you felt the awkwardness through your screen...
Who remember when rug stared at Jackie’s butt a few years ago😂
This is how many time brian said "Awkward''


v
She literally said:

“I don’t know if you wanted this, this is HUGE”
Ok rug I see you I see you
LMFAOOOO WHEN THEY WERE SITTING AT MCDONALDS I CANNOT😂😂😂😂that was sooooo funny!
They are sooo petty towards eachother "We should pull up playing Thank You, Next"😂😂😭
Rug is so awkward with any girl lmao
The way he said “I have a lambo at 2:02”😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What the hell are you doing with this beautiful women LMAO 😂😂😂😂
The title should be switching girl friends it’s so obvious 😂😂
Who noticed that they are wearing different shirts in the thumbnail than the video?🤔
We all knew Rug wanted this ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
bro i was feeling the awkwardness until i kept getting adds every second. THEY WERE UNSKIPPABLE
i know this fool did not just start playing Baby by justin beiber XD
Did the ex couples mean to match? 😂 
23:44
“Take your girl to mcdonalds 2019” good thing. My boyfriend ALWAYS takes me to mcdonalds 😂
Next thing you know brawadis posts “why me and my brother aren’t friends anymore THE REAL TRUTH “
having the four of them in the same video was funny. do another video with all of you together.
Rug: This is the MOST awkward video on this channel!
Next video: BET
7:27 Papa rug covers a box of ciagarretes.
Both EX couples are matching 😂😂
Molly: "am I a joke to you" 😂
17:14 Finally after 10 years I have found someone with good taste in music I thank you Rug
how he refers to molly as "my other ex" I LOVE IT
I have feeling that they are not ex girlfriends but present girlfriends🤣🤣
15:12 parking your Lambo next to a loose shopping trolley is the worse thing you can do
This is how many times rug said awkward 


👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽
22:11 imagine what molly thought
I know it’s not bad to be friends with ur ex but these guys hang out with them to much PERIOD
Nobody:
Not a single soul:
Legit no one ever:
FazeRug: * says weird or awkward *
They had a 4 some later that night 😂
people who drive Lamborghini's -DONT TOUCH IT

Faze rug- DRIVE LAMBO NOW
I like it how everyone in the thumbnail unsatisfied except Brian
The vibe is dead what a turn off! 🤣🤣🤣 don’t get offended y’all lol
Rug lied he said only 2 ex’s but he had a ex when she used Brian for homework
9:09 seatbelt noise was used to make the beat of xxxtentacion - sad
The number of times Brian said awkward i'd be rich
Scale 1-10 how awkward 
My answer: 200
22:00 bro you can see on Jackie’s face before she says no she hesitated. She definitely does miss him
Why is their a pack of smokes at 7:27 😯

hi rug, i know you probably won’t see this but i have to try. my dad owns a pawn shop and he’s not doing very well with it, i have 2 sisters my mom and dad obviously, one of my sisters is getting married in cancun mexico on june, my dad is struggling to pay the trip for my mom, sister,him and me and he actually owes money to my engaged sister so he is ver desperate and he’s gonna sell his truck, i love him very much because he does his best to give us what we need, we are not broke but he’s really struggling with money atm and i don’t want him to sell his truck because he really loves it. he owns a 80’s cherokee (i think) but it is old and another old truck that he uses for work. he’s been wanting a jeep since i have memory and i really want to buy it for him but i don’t have te money... if you can help me any way i would really appreciate it very much (sorry if my english is bad, i’m from mexico)

Youll probably won't look at this but if you do........  It’s your place in the world; it’s your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live.. Success is almost totally dependent upon drive and persistence. The extra energy required to make another effort or try another approach is the secret of winning. I'm just a small Youtuber that one day wants to be great on Youtube.. I'm not asking for anything but i would love for ANY support... ANY. Thanks for reading🙏❤️
Best video idea yet

Something from digital storm 😂
I knew it was a PC bc digital storm is a PC/gaming company
Rug you order a $10000 pc and they just drop it from the sky

I think it counts because it still went in the hoop anyway. Rug rats for life
I was dead when he said happy  Easter then missed
14:49 ABSOLUTELY counts... I'm totally confused on why he THINKS it doesn't.
It LITERALLY made it in.  No one ever said which rim the entire game.
Rug why you keep saying what the hell everytime ? I go for Rug dad :)
Don't believe in the Easter Bunny but I believe in you and I believe that you can hit the highest subscribers that you can
So what happened Rug? I thought this was your game & you practice all the time!
I STILL LYSM, PEACE OUT!
After video is finished

Faze Rug: alright were's the money
I think it does because it is a trick shot game

THE PROCESS   Philippians 1:6

The process – I’ve been hearing that word a lot lately, mispronounced with an ‘a’ and stressed in
an ad perhaps. Spiritual growth is a process. It involves: HOLY SPIRIT, our
willingness to change, and time. Life can be considered a process; we are
created through sex by GOD in our mother’s womb, we are born, grow, mature, live,
age, and die. GOD allowed it to be this way and created a process to fix the ails
we brought to it. Hence GOD in JESUS CHRIST decided to pay the price for our
faults Himself (His righteous judgments demands punishment) so setting us free.
Could it have been done any other way? No! Because GOD’s way is the Way.
If you see this 







Happy EASTER everyone!

I think it counts. I could see if he called the left hoop then he’d have to make it in the left and if he made it in the right after calling the left then it wouldn’t of counted. But he didn’t call a hoop. Just like if y’all made it in either hoop it counted without calling it. Just let it count

👇🏼

Chicken shi* was the worst in my opinion
chicken s***
who knew that they went 1,2,1,2,1,2?
Anthony thick...
You guys should've tricked him and put yellow food coloring and said it was rugs dogs ...well ya know
At the beginning of the vid the guy with the white shirt was mouthing what Faze Rug said
What if you guys put ice in there
The worst item I think is chicken s*** or squidward
I’m sorry but I hate this vid cause y’all are so mean to papa rug😭
Lol rug said Anthony cheating at 15:13 but at 14:49 on his last try he touched instead of throwing it.
14:52 😆😂 faze
But not the bad stuff stays in the dunk tank and whatever you choose it will be disgusting
I can’t believe he threw a fish

If you're able to do multiple $10k challenges, wish that could have been also made to these orgs as well. That or at least match the donation.

Anyone else thought Hayden (from Rock Paper Scissors shoot) was cute 😂💕🤷‍♀️
This is honestly one of my favorite videos of all time. This vid had some humor, suspense for the competition, and very nice edits. But in the end, it was so beautiful to see all the money come down to what really matters. Shout out to one of my fav youtubers. Love you faze rug.
That one girl against rug kinda bugged🙄

Brian donated $30 more dollars and if u put all the donation money together it adds up to $1,430 and we all know “143” means “I love you” how cute I saw the hidden message Brian !(: <3
Bruh his face was legendary at 6:09.
I literally cried at the end. You guys are such good people I would have donated, but I don't have social media. You are the people we need in our future, God bless.

Who needs extra subs? I got you! All us smaller channels have to help eachother out!! ((:
I go to Boys and Girls Club and we do Triple play, Survival, and Free time. We eat snack when we first enter. We do Fancy Friday, Fancy Friday is when we read certificates  of all the amazing things we do over the week. After we do Triple play and Survival we sign up for things we want to do and while some people are sighing up the rest are doing Free time.

She donated to a animal shelter with my dog right next to me while watching this video
ur kindness is unbelievable
No when he sang I died lol
Positive vibes only
If Your Reading This I Hope You Have A Wonderful Year.
I would just do this everyday if I was rug now that he has a fan base he prolly made more from this than normal videos
I cried for the charity donation
Are all his cousins hot asf- junior
Is it just me or was the dude faze sold his shoes to fine asf
Definitely Not Scripted!
What do you think, yes you.
Kevin did not have highest that kid with shoes donated 500 for shoes
I go to the boys and girls club
I go to the boys and girls club
Yay I wanted Nore to win
Isn't it slightly weird that the chicks phone switched from an 8 to and x multiple times
I'm mad!!!! He just got money from fans that's not near legit
mine friend go too boys and girls club at mine school
That voice on the phone sounds sketch
Bro got no chin lol
I literally would have went to the ATM and when I came back be like I got so much money
I wish I could've donated more
I will give you 300 dollers
you should've sighend those shoes
Watching Rug’s videos just make my day that much better!❤️ He has a really big heart and a huge inspiration. Love you Rug!
People actually starving out there 😒😧
omg I was in the video
You should have done it with your brother
Rug said ima give a shootout to Kevin cause he donated 60 dollars a guy gave him 500
Henry, where you at ??? lol
Do another video off donation with a YouTuber
Rug we’re are ur backpacks
I think faze rug is going to win
when the guy called i thought he was going to get killed
11:50 I have never worn but look at the bottom I’m the shoe.😹😬
She raised all that money to donate to animals, she could have donated to a homeless shelter, this makes me a little upset how people donate to animals while actual human beings are starving, no offense to animal lovers , just my opinion, but keep up the good work RUG👍
when you burned juniors old shoes and gave him 10 new ones one of them was that orange shoes in 11:50 it does not make any sense
Amazing video rug, do this again, please can you pin this. 👌👌
I was not expecting that at all dang girl
I used to go to boys&girls club before n it was great
ARE THEY STILL DOING THE CHAERTY I HAVR BAD SPELLINH

You really put those shoes up for what it’s worth already I would go buy my own pair with the box .😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️
You should’ve autographed the shoes
rug should've went to a bus stop and asked people there if they want a ride to their destination in a lambo for money like $15 depending on how far.
OMG I knew it was his cousin cause the phone and FaZerug got kicked out but I thought he was gonna win because he got 500 dollars from the nice shoes I love this video so much too and that sighn was funny because it was mostly about hugs
Siiiiiiii
Could have matched the amount. If he has so many expensive shoes.
do u know u could get arrested for doing this
I’m pretty sure the guy who bought the shoes 👟 gave the most money 💰 Of the challenge

Bryan where you at the airport port today in LA? because I’m pretty sure  I saw you 😀 # Rugrats
That hit one million subs congratulations 
To mama rug and papA rug😎🔥🔥
Can't think of anything else to comment so I'm just going to post a waffle recipe.


Ingredients

250g Flour (plain)
7g Baking powder
20g Caster sugar
5g Salt
475ml Milk
2 Eggs
30ml Vegetable oil

Method 

•Weigh all the dry ingredients, place in a large mixing bowl. Break the eggs into the milk and beat the mixture.

•Add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients. Add the oil and mix all ingredients together until all the large lumps have been broken up. Do not over mix otherwise the waffles will be heavy when cooked.

•Pre heat the waffle maker and spray with oil (1 cal spray works well).

•Pour 3/4 of a cup of batter into the waffle maker and cook for 3-4 mins or until golden brown and crispy on the outside.

•Serve hot with maple syrup. Also good served with sliced banana or blueberries.

•Cooked waffles can be frozen and heated up in the toaster. Unused batter mixture can be kept in a container in the fridge for up to 2 days
This is how long your going to be alive for

2:42 STOP SLIME ABUSE CALL- 702 ...  ... ... NOW TO HELP ALL SLIMES

Edit 1: Spam the time :  2:42 over and over, it’s hilarious!
Lava:I WILL DESTROY!!!
Tide Pods:Hold my water
Lava:I can melt and break everything

Baby with tantrum: hold my sippy cup
Rug: who would make lava in their backyard 

Backyard scientist: hold my elixer
Rug needs to collaborate with backyard scientist for these kinds of experiments
Rug should of bought a better furnace and bigger crucible for the actual lava
Watch Brian get all tatted up throughout this year living with the others.
That's melted aluminum, NOT LAVA
Faze rug you are the best... AT BEING STOOPID AND DRAMATIC ALSO UR DA KING OF CLICKBATE
hi that sunset was amazing so your moving with the team 10
Those tide pods looks delicious 😋 






Issa joke don’t eat tide pods
I just want 10 likes and I’ll be happy!! 😊 😅 I’ll be my first...I guess
Yo i have liked every video that you have released and subscribed

No One : 
Viewers : Wow Very Satisfying 
Scientists : What Is Wrong With You , You Are Ruining The Ozone Layer. Now We Have To Go To Mars.
"OMG It turned rock hard" 
That's what she said😂😂
Probably going to be the Tide Pods for the most satisfying!
Faze Rug: Don't Try This At Home

5min. Later

Faze Rug: Ok so first you put lava rocks here...

Lolololololol
“Always use protection” lmao 😂
Mans really used a glass bowl 😂🤦‍♂️
Congrats for mama and papa rug

Congrats on reaching 1 million subs Mama and Papa Rug ❤
Watches YT video on how to make lava

Rug: I’m gonna do that! 😂
I like the content that you made.❤️
You couldn't make the lava correctly because every 20 to 30 minutes you after if check on it in move it around so it mounts faster and with the canned you made molten
Be careful of bosley I don't want him to be eaten like kong
Yoooo 1Million I’ve been subscribed since the beginning to you and mama and papa rug
you said in the description  (We ended up making REAL LAVA) but you melted aluminum. 







sooooo you didn't make REAL LAVA
Floor is Lava challenge?




With real lava?




Just an idea
i never got your notification for this video but i’m happy i found it now💓
awww papa rug playing with the slime in the background ❤️😂😭
Lava is going to be the best one I think
Rug:do not try this at home 
Me: ok I will do it at the park
That ain't real lava cause real lava would burn through the glass bowls and the table
Edit: I hadn't seen the whole vid till now, it just exploded a glass bowl
glass breaks

okay lets decide to use plastic plates 🤦‍♀️
Rug:who else dose this in their backyard 

Viewers:the king of random ......
Me: watches video
Me after video: it said dont try this at home, even tough i already have done it before but ok
I was scared my dog would get picked out by a bird when he was a puppy.  Like I lost him on a flip flop.
Did anyone else notice papa rug enjoying the slime
Not called lava rocks, aren’t they called igneous rocks?
You nearly get 12million subscriber bro OMG!!! Hope you reply me😘

I smashed the like button and my screen broke
I think the table getting burnt is gone be the most satisfying 😆 😂
I think Tide pods should be moist satisfying
You know how many loads of laundry I could’ve done with them tide pods 😂
Rug : which you tuber do I put lava on?
Who remembers that rug used to have like 100 coke boxes in his old house?
I love you so much rug
TheBackyardScientist would do such thing
He said alright daddy wanna check on the lava 😂3:50
I literally have lava rocks outside my house door
Wait wait, If I've seen a how to drive video. Does that mean I can drive? xD






Jk
Satisfying counter :33
Dry ice will probably b more satisfying
Your moving😖😩😭you can't
Rug what happened to Mike 😭😭😭 like if you miss him
LAVA
I feel like the tide pods are going to be more satisfying
Oops when I saw your video the title I already made the lava and when I saw the vid I already did it when you said DONT TRY THIS AT HOME YOU GUYS

The Faze Rug Notification Gang Is To Strong That It Crashed The System
"Faze rug should have delete that video with Molly"🤪😲😬
Imagine if lava on dry ice made ufos stay woke
I haven't watched the vid but I think the dry ice will have the coolest effect just cause there the opposite it's like the hottest Vs the coldest

Edit: well I watched it and don't think I am wrong
This dude gonna cuz the California  fires
Rug: "and then we have tide-pods"
Video instantly DEMONITIZED
1 like = Rug stays in San Diego
Like so Rug can see this
You got my favorite snake tie pods
Your video are so satisfying FaZe Rug and also I love your cars.
Lava and Ice aren't getting along with each other! :( D: 


👇Click here to make them!!!

Faze Rug is honestly one of the greatest YouTubers putting so much effort into his videos although this video didn’t go as planned he had another idea and still kept going. Amazing video awesome work. Always come up with crazy ideas
Who is better
Faze rug like 
Or jake Paul
Papa rug looks so happy in the video
If Faze Rug can have 11M.. Mama Rug and Papa Rug should too! 🙂 Let then be even more happy! :)
Hey Brian! I just want to say that I love you vlogs and videos. You put so much effort into your vids and we really appreciate that! Love you and your family!❤️❤️🔥🔥
I think dry ice was The BEST
Why do I see people posting vids then you post the same type of vids? Not original I see :P
Hey I just wondered what happened to that song rug was going to drop? 🤔
Rip kong ds savage😥😥😥
Bro faze rug is holding his word 2019 and making great vids nice!
“Are you satisfied with the slime “
“Yes” ends the video  dad In the background playing with slime
11million..but ok weird flex
IF WE GET ENOUGH LIKES FOR THIS VIDEO YOU SHOULD TAKE A GO PRO AND PUT IT ON A RC CAR OR DRONE AND FLY/drive on haunted tunnel and you could hook up the camera to the phone and sir in your car and drive it.
Next on the news house sets on fire and starts wildfire from lava
14:08 look at papa rug hilarious😂💀🤪
3:12  Rug: who would ever make lava in their backyard only me 
The backyard scientist: makes lava in his backyard multiple times and actually knows what he’s doing
Love your videos bro keep it up
Rug:do not try this at home
Me:I can do it at the park
Rug !!!! You said you were going to go back to the haunted place with Jess and Janell to spend the night !! I haven’t forgotten about  that 😩
Yea rug this is a great vid bro,i love youu
Rug* Don't try this at home* 
Rug again* even though I'm doing it because of pressteck 
Me*comment on video
You should have called the backyard scientist.
Wait what about the Yellowstone volcano its erupting
How many times did he say lava?!😂😂😂
Not gonna lie but like I kinda like your videos here in San Diego more than In La.But the people in La are awesome in all but I think your videos are more fun and stuff. It’s up to u because U are the one who is moving and stuff.
faze rug plz do a overnight challenge on your roof
The tide pods- most satisfying
I think the slime is gonna be satisfying
Brian: don’t try this at home

Me: I will try it at school so I can burn it😈
I went to San Diego and saw your house I didn't want to bother you so I went right past it
I love you faze rug❤ marry me.?
I WATCHED 11 ADS [ NOT KIDDING ]
You should do a  escape room with James Charles
NO MATTER WHO DOUBTS ME, IM STILL GONNA SUCCEED ON YOUTUBE 😈🎥




& THESE PEOPLE WILL SUCEED TOO ❤️
👇🏼
I think the coolest effect would be the tide pods
That is the best “let’s frikin make some lava”
Papa rug - "quack quack quack quack"
😂😂😂
I love your vids and close to 12 millon subs hope you keep it up and hope you be safe and why do you do this but that is ok!
I love how he says don’t attempt from anyone and it turns out he took it from someone who also made a vid 😂 😂 😂
That mercy be very careful because you can get in a infection
10:04 sounds like a girls voice... 🤷‍♀️
I knew it would explode😂😂😂
THEY ONLY HIT THAT MANY SUBS BECUZ OF U BRO DUHHHH!!!! THEY BETTER BE GRATEFUL!! GREETINGS FROM MILWAUKEE WI.
I wonder if people actually watch the video before commenting😂😂
Did anybody notice he changed his shoes 3 times nmds, nmds, Gucci flip flops
Rug: Don’t try this at home

Me: Hey mom can I go over to my friends house
I can’t believe you’re making real lava🔥
Literally when it was dark in the bigging of the video I thought it was 6 am
Says safety 1st 2 min into the video XD
Yoo
Brian u should fill your pool with dry ice
it's funny how you say that not to do it at home when you get inspired by other Youtubers doing it 😂
I didn't get the notification
Faze rug should work at Area 51
Don’t move I live in San Diego and I haven’t met you yet😭
Faze I havn't warched Your show in a few weeks. I just wanted to say We Miss You and hopefully this never happens again. Keep consistent. Thats' the Clue to Your Success! Love You Broski.
11:57 that song in the background always gives me a wierd feeling lol
This is how many more subs papa and mama rug are gonna get in a week
👇
Woooowww Yass Papa rug Yasss mama rug also WOW THOSE THING...JUST WOW
I feel bad because everything was so anticlimactic
Dont do those videos because you are damaging our planet with that carbon
Hey Faze Rug I am a very big fan of you💯 you inspire me to have a YouTube channel, I really want to be just like you, you have the most Lit videos on YouTube right now.  You are my favorite YouTube, without you YouTube would be so lame bro, but you are the best faze rug💯🗣
If your subscribed to mama rug and papa rug only
👇🏼
Faze rug someone did a edit for you
Papa. Rug has the best reaction
when you gonna fight tf
1:48 put the captions on and it says do not make love at home😂😂
Do a video we’re u play look at me by xxxtentacion in public it will be funny
This is the best video I've seen
Did it annoy anyone else that he was saying lava rocks instead of igneous
Nothing like some good lava
this boy said dont try this at home we read the instructions lol like ima about to build a volcano but dont worry because i read the instructions
Omg this is how many people,like FaZe Rug
👇
I wont do it at my house. Ima do it at my cousins house no cap 😂 jk
When I subbed to mama and papa rug the thing that said the amount of subscribers turned to 1mil
I like how they bothered to put on gloves so they don’t burn themselves but wear socks and flippers. LOGIC
it turns rock hard because after a volcano erupts, lava comes crashing down and after it gets on land, it turns to ash or magmawich is like a rock except magma is before it turns to ash
CONGRATS ON 1 MIL SUBS MAMA AND PAPA RUG 🎉 🎊
Lessons learned : if u live next to a volcano paste your house with thick slime 🤪🤣🤣🤣
Oh geez.. Says we can't make more liquid because we don't have anymore cans. Bruh you are pouring it into multiple aluminum trays
I feel like tide pods will be the most satisfying tbh
Love Mama and Papa rug speech lol
Faze where's Mike??!!
If you  are missing  the view than why are u leaving home screw Alley
1:30 not really sure that we see lava very often 😂😂😂💪
Yo Rug can you hit me up with the slime oh you burned it.
Bro we need more videos with molly. You two have an amazing bond on camera. Also, she is just so nice to look at, you two are so good looking together! SO HELLLLO GET ON IT MOTHAFUKA

It's funny that I subscribed to both of those channels around the time Brian makes this video
I love your videos keep up your hard work
I subscribed to mama and papa rug 🎊🎉✨congrats mama and papa rug ✨🎉🎊
I think the tide pods are gonna be the most satisfying
When did you get that tattoo on you arm?🤔
It didn't go through the watermelon because water is the solution to molten rock and fire in general
Moving to LA is my dream lol
The orbeez were screaming🤣🤣🤣i love you rug😍😍
8:30 you are relishing toxic fumes in the air
You should of done the lava rocks

This is how many times Muma rug said thank you 
👇🏼

When u mentioned king I started to cry cause king was so crazy and energetic and we all loved him I hope it doesn’t happen to Bosley
Tide pods will be most satisfying
I thought lava was suppose to be orange yellow and red
“We watched safety videos”

Glass blows up
I subscribe to them yesterday
*Dont try this at home
Like if anyone can just get lava
I wonder if rugs videos are getting dimonotized too🤔
what if you put the dry ice on lava ?
So once you take the lava out you have to put the lava on the item quick before it goes into rock. 4:54
5:59 when my friend doesn’t clutch up a 1v1 in fortnite
Y'all aren't even doing it right
THE WATER MELON. TO KEEP ME CLEAN😉
Faze rug:shouts out 2 people who have done lava videos

I saw you in public
Imma try it at my friends house😁
Why’d he change like 5 times through out the video
Mama and papa rug owe it all to faze rug
Rip kong 😢💔
That actually isn't lava, as you already said. It's aluminum.
Whats the name of the back round music
I can give u a tip that silver liquid from the cans can be used again just wash the silver liquid then put it in that pot after that melt it so it is reusable.
Hey its suppose to be like aluminum foils
My aunts boyfriend saw u in San Diego
That Grayish blackish lava is called “Amaterasu” 😏😂
That's not lava its gallium ( melted metal )

Your bed is lava get off of IT!

Stop stealing other youtubers ideas
What’s the song you use in the background?
Is it just me or dose the lava look like gallium
Am I the only one who is bothered when rug calls the aluminum “lava”
I think the most satisfying think was the tide pods
Awww i really wanted to meet u but ur moving to ls Angeles and u wont be in san diego
Faze rug my brother said he seen you in real life
Omg, I was so nervous for you! I kept saying, move back, get back, move, move, move! I'm such a mom! Lol
Rip kong hello broley blue
Theres one thing about this channel its go the best content
I Liked the orbeez one it was pretty cool .P. And it sounded like the orbeez were dieing while screaming.
So basically melted soda cans ... not lava
rug just make your random vlogs again
OMG who else clicked as soon as the got the notification?!? 💕

Btw I am a small youtuber!
The Backyard Scientist made a bunch of lava in his backyard
U should buy a guard dog
You guys for sure didn’t let it heat up right, the thing the “lava” is supposed to be in should be bright red
The alluminum cans is basically a cheap liquid mercury
Who helped mama rug and papa rug hit 1mil?
I wonder if faze rubs it in his family that he has the most subscribers 😂
I thought I was watching ridiculousness with the warning intro
can you please play one man hide n seek but not by yourself.
🔥
Honestly if I poured the lava I would have probably poured it on myself
where are they getting all these empty cans 😂?
He's moving into the clout house?
the most satisfying item will be i think will be orbezs or the slime
8:24 ok it smells good but ok should’ve put it out faster because of the chemicals in the tide pod
You should check out the king of random for some cool videos they do molten aluminium (what you used) and other cool things as well maybe get some video ideas
Brian I will go back though all your vids and like all of them
Update us on mike

It's just a beautiful place you live in rug and a amazing family you have that's why I think people subscribe to you cause you and your family are lit love you rug please keep doing what you are doing
Faze rug your dad is like the coolest dad I’ve seen
Who here is still wondering where is his damn music video😂😂😂
I'm weird but I'm scent the smell of the tidpod when they did the tidpod
14:11 papa rug is my mood
You should do a challenge where you should pick a song any song and you only can say those lyrics in that song for 24 hours lol
I think fazerug is a second version of Sanjay😂
FaZe Rug's Channel has become FaZe ASMR
5:58 I swear I was just sitting there waiting for the glass to break.
You have to wear eye protection guys..
can't you just dye it with orange food coloring and make it look like lava
Congratulations Sana and Rafat-Ron Mama And Papa Rug for hitting 1 million finally
Slime is going to be most satisfying just by looks
DO YOU PLAY BULLET FORCE
We can now call faze rug the one million family
Bro rug your doin something right cuz this vid was posted 1 hr ago and already has 13k likes. I am one of those like as well
How many times he says lava

Did you guys hear brian say daddy 4:35
6:58 The Sound Made Me Think Of The Flash When He Moved His Hand
My name is Adrian2008 on Instagram
Make overnight challenge at your old house
Those rocks are igneous rocks
i think the most satisfying thing will be the tide pods.
You should put lava into your pool next
Nothing was satisfying
How about you put the “lava” beetween the lava or dry ice or anything?
Look good in the mir at the boosjes u see fan time 3:32
Damn bro your channel has turned into one of those that cater to kids and views. Miss the old vlogs

“Puts linx Africa in the furnace
Rug, you should make a Gummy Garden with edible dirt!! I did it on my channnel, it's so cool! 🤗
You are best bro

Thats not lava its just heated up gallium
Backyard scientist first
Aww I wanted to see real lava. Like if u did to.
I’ll be at 1 Million soon, mark my words 😉

Y’all going to get Chemical poisoning
There’s a difference between lava and molten metal

Brian you need to wait until its fully red hot. You didnt let it get hot enough
i bet you won’t respond. if u do i’ll sub
Really needed more on each item :/
It’s not lava it’s aluminium. Ffs stop clickbaiting.
i think the slime is going to be the most satisfying duh
That kinda looks like gallium
Stay with papa and mama rug
Faze rug you should do  24 hrs without using phone challenge

Slime is going to be the size find one
Okay rug I’ll just make in the park.Since i cant do it at home

Tide pods most satisfying for me
Notification squad (like for good luck )🍀

You should upload daily
You should go to cry baby bridge.
“Lava rocks” aka cold hardened mud aka dirt
thats not lava dude. that is hot aluminum
Will you try this with actuall lava
I think the dry ice   is going to be the most satisfying
Lava vs all trending things
I miss the scarier videos! Please make more😬
How many times did he say lava tf
Who watches Faze Rug instead of doing homework? Me lol...
Anyone want to be yt friends or šūb to eachother?
I smelt this through the screen
Moving into the faze house... what happened
You make me so happy

Trick on how to know burger/fries location

1 Like = 1 Prayer for rug at the end
This is one test I would easily pass✔
My man guessed Popeyes for McDonald’s🤦‍♂️
0:27 
Rug: the amazing I love them 
My mom listening: is hope that kid loves his parents
The restaurants were the same
Kinda suspect 🤔
I just came here to say Chick-fil-A sells gods chicken. It's not a hamburger. 
Didn't watch the video btw
Not gonna be races but Katelyn looks way whiter today but she's still pretty and will always be
Rug:So is this Wendy's?

Faze rug- sorry if my challenges make you hungry....

You shouldnt tell what the wrong answer was, process of elimination makes the test easier.
Big up San Diego! Whoop whoop
I ship it y’all need to get back together
Wow your parents got in 1 day 1 million congrats
I love how you and your ex are still friends
Do a cod bo2 trick shot challenge with someone 👀
Mc Donald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King and chick fil a would be the easiest for me to guess
This was too cute, I wanna play!!
I am hungry 😋 now , thankxxx rug lmao 😂
Awe he feed her so normal like they together
I don’t think Rug knows what a phenomenon is.
Kalin cheded because ahe skiped in-in-out
you looked ashame when you said i ate this for breakfast LOL love you fazerug best you tuber everrrrrr
Kalin is very cute for you fazrug
You should make a video of who can guess what chip it is
Faze Rug: puts chick fil a in thumbnail with and as a burger.

Chick fil a: has left the chat
We got mama and papa rug to 1M! 😄 TURN UP!
I was hungry untilk the pic of the salad came up
This is the best frie McDonald’s how u don’t know
BRIAN YOUR A REAL ONE 👍👍🤣😂🤣😂
I just dropped a banger🔥‼️.... just thought I’d let you in on the big news
Tbh I rather be the loser so I can have a reason to eat fast food 😂😂
I seen him before true story we took a pic
“I just had this for breakfast” 😂😂
He doesn’t forget the challenge but he forgets his camera hahaha😂
as an in n out employee, I'm offended
4:15 he said eat a salad i eas eating a salad but really craving  in-n-out 😂😂😂
As soon as I saw the tittle I went to go get a snack like if u did to
I would honestly lose the challenge just to eat all of the food lmao
Omgggg my heart dropped when she made a disgusted face with the five guys burger 😂😂😂 ps I'm from the east coast cant u tell
You couldve done burger king , sonic , waterburger , braums lol so many to choose from i know alot of yall like these places to
By telling her if she was right or wrong right away it makes the game easier as you go. Process of elimination
I still ship u two u guys would be so cute
OMG you got all the other burgers but Burger King burgers😮😮
can rug blindfold me one day
How is that a punishment? I’d literally be happy I love fast food
No whataburger? Y'all tripping

"I can swim by the stairs" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
who saw the tattoo rugs hand
I hope ONE of you could please read this it would mean the earth to me for real 🌌 I grew up broke with not much, grew up in a garage, sometimes had to use water instead of milk for cereal because of no money. But I always wanted to make music, because hearing my favorite music took me to different places. So when I was able to get a job I saved up over the summers to get my own studio, and I did. I want to make the best vibes possible. I hope to get big enough so the whole world could feel vibrations through my sound, because In a world so divided, the one thing that still brings us together is good music. Thank you for reading. and have an amazing day 👽

It's not only pugs its dogs in general
How is bosley blind bruh
You should visit Australia QLD Gold coast is where i went on holiday

He always follows what other youtubers do, like create your own content
You didn’t buy the store
Belive me I have a pug and know
How much times did rug say he’s 80 percent blind
Pugs and huskys are the best
faze remember when you played fortnite in the movies
I love Bosley so much with all my heart like all the dogs in the whole entire world. God bless all the animals in the whole entire world ❤🙏🐶.
Bosley ain't blind tho

Wait bosley is blind?
Imagine the dog starts touching the women and rug needs to bye them😂
I have a pug that is blind too and he is sick and his name is smoky
These videos seem so pushed out and forced nowadays
Brian I don’t think 500 is anything cause u make more then 50,000 a month so for u saying what 500$ was lame Ik your jk but some people think your serious
Fyi bosley is not spoiled with drinking water with ice because all pugs are prone to heat stroke so it’s best if they drink a lot go cold water with ice 🙂
He touched the store u have to buy it
I did not know he was blind
awwww bosley is honestly the best dogs in the world and pugs are AMAZING 😍

Not a hater of rug, actually a long time supporter but it’s rug that’s the spoiled one not Bosely, he literally goes to stores buys shit he doesn’t need. Some people like me could really use that money 🤔😂
I havent seen bosley in a long time
I have a cow and she is pregnant and blind and I love her so so so so so so much 💙
You are the target  for the krodgnt
Is he actually blind or did he just say he was blind for the video

He said blind dog for views. If he said bosley he wouldint get as much
Pugs = Pubg

Is it true that your dog is blind?
He wants another pug friend because statistics show that dogs are better with friends because they feel more comfortable with spaces. Plus it would make a great video. I WOULD DEFINITELY WATCH AND RECOMMEND THE VIDEO THANKS FOR YOUR TIME
I have a pug too.  He is also blind and deaf like he is struggling but he is 14 years old! He is super cute and sheds everywhere but it’s worth it
I like how he says blind dog for them views even though his dog 1 eye is blind
I miss hammy 😥
Hi rug rats have an amazing day
Currently in the United States, ferrets are only illegal in California and Hawaii. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said on its website that animals like ferrets that are legal pets elsewhere are illegal in the state "to protect public health and safety, agriculture, wildlife, and natural resources."Apr 4, 2018
This is why some people's doesn't buy pugs Because they cause money and their hard to take care  but the people who buys them is a real family but some people who buys them only makes them like a guard dog in the house and not a family




And yes my grammar is horrible so please dont judge me its not my first language (Love you RUGRATSS
I love you and your videos so much I've been a fan for so long it's crazy how far we've came as Rugrats 💙💙 Get you a man that loves you the way Brian loves Bosley

Donate the food to a dog that needs help
if you want hammy back. then get a guinea pig. they can live up to 8 years and they aren't as boring.
Why does Brian sometimes sound mad at Bosley when BRIAN was the one who is saying “Do you want that?” and touching the item so Bosley can touch it.
Petco over Petsmart lol
He only drinks water with ice lol
Hey ilysm faze rug but idk if u need that guinea pig playspace and if you don't need it I have 2 guini pigs. If your giving them away I would be more than happy get it. thanks.

Pug are amazing pets! I had one for 15 years, his name was Pudgy and he was more like my brother than my pet! Sadly he passed away in 2014. My Pug was also partially blind, and super picky about everything lol. He would only eat one type of dog food and he wouldnt drink from his water bowl unless it had ice in it! Its gotta be a Pug thing!
Sorry to tell you rug but small dogs are not very intelligent
PUGS ARE BEST DOGS 😭😭❤️
