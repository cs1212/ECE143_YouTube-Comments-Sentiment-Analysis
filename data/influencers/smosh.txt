Nobody:
Archie Andrews: *takes off shirt
The Riverdale one was just unedited footage from the actual show.
Shayne: "IS THAT A TAMPON?!"
okay but the Jake Peralta from Brooklyn Nine Nine was pretty accurate
Love how shayne is the main character in almost all of them
Shayne is the best Archie cosplayer indeed.
Sabrina what are you doing here?
* pause*
Chilling
Nobody:
Absolutely Nobody:
Someone quoting something Shayne said: "I'm a robot Virgin"
Both Betty and Veronica wanna sleep with me

Me:Noted
You coulda made Anthony come back just to be Jon snow 😂
Smosh’s version of Netflix is the best one ever 😂
YESS FINALLY YOU DID RIVERDALE
AND WHAT YOU SAID...... I AGREE WITH IT
EEK I just discovered Shayne was in the tv shows Sam and Cat AND icarly
At 1:08 I thought Damien was Anthony Padilla, lmao I thought he finally came back xD
Anyone else realized their profile picture and banner changed
The most accurate version of Riverdale ever.
use me as a 'I've only watched stranger things' button
"hey Sabrina....... w-what are you doing here?"
"chillin'"
Like buttons are shapes and symbols we just dont understand
did shayne get tired from being in almost every single scene? XDXD
No one:
Literally no one:
Shayne:I'm A Robot Virgin
Smosh needs to do every  rich person ever

Like if  you agree
⏬
I watch stranger things and the chilling adventures of Sabrina XD
Like-old smosh
Comment-new smosh
The quality of Smosh content has come right back again - writing and production value on point and the MIMICRY IS FLAWLESS
The brooklyn nine nine one is so true
Where is the rest of the smosh squad... I like Courtney and Shayne but they're hogging every video and Olivia Keith and Noah are like invisible now. What's going on.
Can you make every new student ever?
Tbh I miss the old music. But all in all, I love the new direction of Smosh!!
My favorite YouTube channel: smosh
My favorite show: Brooklyn nine-nine 

OMG
Nobody:
Shayne: Is ThIs WhErE wE bOnE rObOtS

Courtney as Sabrina is what I needed in my life
Perfect impression of Matthew McConaughey
Omfg I didn't know that shayne was in The Goldbergs.its generally my favourite TV show and your in it
Missing one thing..
THE B99 WAS PERFECT 😭😭❤️❤️
If game of thrones were real everyone would have extra chromosomes
every in n out ever 








like if agree
This should be every video. Shayne in basically every single scene.
Riverdale is my favourite
If BLANK were real isn't the same without Anthony 😭
I know that 99%of people won't read this but to the 1% people who read I just want to say that you're 
Marvelous 
Good 
Lucky 
Never bad
Always right
How dare u 
1. How long did it take u to make a bb99 ep
2. Also how dare u make it bad
They should have brought Anthony on to do the Jon Snow part
The logo changed again
“By natural law, humans shouldn’t exist”
10 seconds later
“ you go into a uniqlo but only try H&M clothing “
NEXT YOU SHOULD DO IF 2000

"Yo is this the place where we bone robots ?"
                  ~Shayne Topp
Shayne in true detective is BEAUTIFUL
Next video idea: COLLAB WITH ANTHONY
What happened to the usual If [blank] Were Real theme?
Lol is it just me or they added Jon snow just cuz everyone says Anthony look like Jon snoe xD
It's been a while since we've seen Sergeant Anous...
Smosh-the fallen champion
The true detective one was so on-point😂👌🏻
They coulda got Anthony back to play Jon snow
Ok but that was actually a really great Andy Sandburg impression
More of this.
Please keep interspersing more videos than just the Every Blank Ever videos.
Why is Riverdale so accurate.
Why did that capture Jake pearlato perfectly?
Shane does a pretty good impression of Andy Samberg
I love how at least one person in every scene is just straight up confused 😹
哈哈哈哈哈🤣
Those are the funniest
SHAYNE IS SO TALENTED!
There should be a shaynes workout routine in like a show with no name format
Could you imagine how stupid it would be if all TV shows were realistic.
every teen wolf ever?
WAIT NO STOP AWKWARD KITTY THOSE DAYS R OVER-
"Chillin" 😂
Damn Courtney looks good on the westworld one
Yay Brooklyn nine nine it was amazing
Love the new icon

You should do a CW in real life!!

They did 3 of my favorite shows in a row, Westworld (4) Game of Thrones (1) and Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2)
"This is gonna be a good season"

Welp.
*Im gonna make funny comments all the way back to the station...*
WEEWOOWEEWOOWEEWOO!!!

Ian :- Oh he doesnt know , this is gonna be a good season . 
Me:- ..........

Omg this is the best one yet! Yall stepping up your game! Be super proud❤️❤️🤩🤩
i love that damien is in the main cast now 😭😭😭😭 and that he makes regular appearances on smosh pit 🤗
3:28 Uhhmm one question:






Why does Damien look like Dustin and Mike into one??
God: invents humans

Humans: invent Brooklyn 99

God: Decent one fam
That Matthew McConaughey impression was spot on!
You know who should be in game of thrones....... U KNOW!!!
Stranger things one was great and probably true 😂😂😂
Where's the old "If blank were real" song?
What is the name of the cut music that goes like ba da ba da ba da
Food battle 2019 with courtney miller

This is a good video. LOL love the Ian cop cameo.
Has anyone noticed Shayne and courtney are literally taking over smosh

After a long time i fully enjoyed a
 smosh video
The riverdale one was so true.
Anthany left the  smosh Channel
make a channel of anothony is back becuse it's not right with out him
This is my last comment on this channel if you see this comment well nice
The game of thrones one killed me😂😂
Captain Holt will be mad for Shayne not wearing a tie 🤣
I saw Riverdale And STRANGER THINGS I clicked so fast
Smosh was better with Anthony and his friend....
Sometimes i would watch one of ur every [blank] ever and cant stop watching for a least
Plz do Every big sister ever
Season 4 Stranger Things looks cool
You can not call him jug head

Call him the Milk man

Hahahahha love ur channel keep up the good work!!!
oh my god they used Lacrymosa as their backing track for Sabrina, I LOVE that song!!
What song did they use for chilling adventures of Sabrina ?
Im miss Anthony ;-;
I miss the music they added to the “if (Blank) were real” vids. 

You know the one 

Oh those good old times. 

(Sighs)
You should've made Anthony play the role Jon Snow... :/
That riverdale one was good but kind of wrong betty and jughead are obviously the best
"this is going to be a good season" O how wrong he was...
LETS GO BROOKLYN NINE-NINE..






I LOVE B99
Smosh please do every netflix ever it would be so good
I thought damien as jon snow was anthony
Smosh: Uploads an 'If Blank were real' without Anthony and Ian Sketch in the beginning
Me:Wait, That's Illegal!
Sergeant Anous is back
I didn't know I needed a Courtney as Steve moment until now.
When I saw Jon Snow I thought Anthony is back...
😊😊😊
3:58 that theme is from hunter x hunter! Fits perfectly ngl
This is the Riverdale we all need lol!
0:50 
Did a robot just blink??
???:can you imagine if every tv shows were real?
This is great
Courtney’s stunning like always❗️♥️
And denarys is now the evil in GOT
4:05

Wait a sec...

SMOSHFLIX!
Robo-Virgin
If you love your Mom
Like my comment
Courtney: I'm gettin a British accent Fuuu 😂
British Accent: Pardon me, what the bloody 'ell is this?
I was hoping for some Lucifer :D
Can you guys continue with series like this? I’m getting really bored of every blank ever and you should put that series on hold for a bit.
American Horror Story should
Be on part 2 of this
Shayne last time: HEY IS THAT A TAMPON
Shayne this time: HEY IS THIS THE PLACE WHERE YOU BONE ROBOTS
I miss Anthony and Ian intro and outro in this kind of videos
Nobody:
Not a single sole:
Ian: I’ve killed them
you are my favorite channel
Okay but riverdale is spot. on. Oh archiekins 😂
Damien is too good at Jon Snow
This honestly feels more like "what if shows were in the 21st century" but whatever fits
chilling adventures of sabrina got me HAHA
Why did I laugh so hard when  Courtney said “Chilling”?!?!
Who else misses AntHOnY??😭
I don’t want to watch Netflix, there’s too much content there...

SHUT UP!
WHO came for Stranger Things?
The chilling adventures of Sabrina was really subtle lol
WHERE HAVE I HEARD THE BGM IN THE SABRINA SKIT??!?!?!?!?! ANYONE TELL ME WHAT NAME
I'm a cute charming endering cop😂
I LOVE B99! NINE-NINE WHERE YOU AT?
I like the old smosh better 
Too many people joined and smosh just died like that :(
In the Brooklyn nine-nine part it is really close to something Jake would do
"your watching old episodes of saved by the bell, and your wondering if the bell might've saved you" 😂
"Chilling"
Do lucifer next 
Who’s with me?
I watched every season of Stranger Things and I can't wait for Season 4
Also, we look hella old now!
🤣🤣🤣
I love that Ive seen more then half of the shows in this video😂 They were all great
Brooklyn nine-nine was so accurate it was scary
Anthony should be john snow
the reason why shayne got to be archie was just to be able to take off his shirt.


that's one thing they have in common.
You should do ever 3rd grade ever.
YES!!!RIVERDALE
At 1:46 minutes Shane looks like Jake peralta from Brooklyn nine-nine my favourite show
Can you do a if people were anime 3 please please
I laughed so hard I killed my doggy 😂🤣
Like about 5 yrs
I love riverdale like if u agree and game of thrones and sabrina
leaked scene from the new stranger things season 3
On my word Sabrina 💛
3:23 turn playback speed to 0.25x
Shayne is my favourite cosplayer place
Do: Every ASMR Ever
Shane=Jake perolta from Brooklyn NINE-NINE
Remember when you are the most subscribed channel
“We look hella old now” 

Wow puberty hit those Stranger Things kids LIKE A TRUCK
I missed these! I can't single out the funniest scene.
I miss food battle
Man. You guy's have changed..
I love smosh 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
HELLO RANDOM PERSON IN THE COMMENTS I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY ❤❤
How DARE you do andy samberg like that!
I miss Ian and Athony talking about how stupid if TV shows were real then they imagine about it
The true detective part- I literally thought Ian was Joe Bereta???
riverdale is lit, loving that show
Should have included Big Bang Theory, since it is reaching its finale
I definitely think Shayne wrote this episode lmao
Simple. 
I SEE ARCHIE
I CLICK
THE TWILIGHT ZONEEEEE😂😂😂😂
Wow we all watched the whole video in 1 minute
S/o to People eliminating nefariousness 15 in the town of Dixon, they make great cider none of the artificial crap.
Every time they changed their profile photo something bad happens
Solid Andy Sandberg impression.
I miss the shut up intro
Winters never a good season. hahaha
This is great... 10/10


I love this! Smosh is best at remaking Netflix shows!
That moment when you realize that Riverdale is based on Archy
Are you dissin my stranger things? lol
LOVED IT SO MUCH
Literally only watched this for GoT. Dont know any other show ..
courtney as momma steve is perfection
Why are you using that music between TV Shows instead of the old one ☹️
I’ll buy the merch if Anthony comes back
I wanted to see the Goldberg's because if you watch that show you know why.
Taking one letter of of tv shows
woah smosh slow down i have to fangirl on stranger things
So much netflix series but not lucifer, waited for it the whole video.
The Riverdale one pissed me off 🤣
I love how Shane was basically in every bit.
Do every tik tok ever
Anthony should be jon snow
Smosh next of video games in real life 👌👌🤘🤘🤘🖒🖒🖒
I saw Brooklyn nine nine and died of laughter😂
I liked true detective with Rick hits bullys dad and cool sences with him
You guys should put WWE Raw on one
I always thought Courtney would be an awesome Sabrina (the chilling adventures of Sabrina is my favorite T.V. Show
I need the music, please
Hey!Sgt.Anous does not have a beard
Matt Bradley from the goldbergs ¿¿
Nine-Nine!
Brooklynn 99 got me😂😂
During True Detective Ian somehow looks like Joe Berreta’s brother
TV shows are my favorite pizza place
Mann... I was waiting for supernatural lmao.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine would be more or less the same
what was the bg music used during the Sabrina parody ?
1:08 you know who would have been good for Jon snow 
 
Anthony
Please so every baskin Robbins ever
For the next one, if there will be, please do Lucifer
Archie WHERE IS REGGIE??? hmm or is he with veronica????
I knew it, these wouldn't be realistic
Omg I love shouting shayne
No views , 54 likes and 27 comments
this was so ridiculously accurate! loved it!
all the netflix shows but it's just shayne and courtney
Why is Shayne in almost every single show
Shayne is in almost every thing
Why was Shayne literally Matthew McConahay for True Detective 😂
"This is gonna be a good season"
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do tv shows kids actually know
Ian panicking is actually the funniest thing

“I confess I killed him” 
“I didn’t even ask”
“I know I just panicked, can you talk slower?”
I love Brooklyn nine nine it’s the best
Sergeant Anous is back!
I literally knew 0 of these shows... Help
Next one you need to do on my block that sh*t is good 👍🏻👌🏻
Me when I saw Brook lawn 99👌
I wish u did ❤️ON MY BLOCK ❤️ but anyway it’s really good
can u do if sons of anarchy was real
Oh my god a video finally my childhood channel also back with the hilarious videos , i was watching a video I got the notifcation so i clicked immediatly
can u do if sons of anarchy was real
I miss anthony wish he was here since he left. smosh never was really that funny anymore i wish he will comeback
Can you do a every ampm ever
I love how my ad is legit Riverdale
!!❤️!!When r u gonna do a video with lazercorn,flitz,Sohinki,jovanshire and the others I want another video plsssss!!❤️!!
These probably would have been funnier if I'd actually seen one of them.
Do every middle school ever
Who else liked the old smosh a lot better I'm sad that the 2 creators of smosh sold thier channel to some company  so now theirs a bunch of more people it was better when their was only 2 people
Umbrella Academy.. is the best
1:08it would’ve been even better if Anthony was there with his curly hair ;-;
Welcome back Smosh, we missed you
My personal favourite
Whoa there was an ad for a Riverdale convention before this video and I though it was part of this and I was so confused😂😂
If you do if TV shows were real 5 add supernatural to it
The color changed again
Smosh is awesome
AWESOME VID good luck on your future vids!
Ok but why does shayne with the blond wig in True Detective look exactly like Gina Linetti from Brooklyn 99???? -minus the mustache 😂😂
If comic book ware really
If comic book ware really
Damien as Jon snow??????? Heck yeah... (the only guy i know of the show due to memes, i dont watch GOT)
I recognized 15% of these lol
Jake peralta in 30 seconds
If comic book ware really
If comic book ware really
If comic book ware really
You should do Lucifer next😂😈
Ian’s bit killed me 😂
Is it weird that I haven’t seen one show on this list 😂😂
I wish yall used the original jingle  from "If ___ were Real"
I know she's gone, but everyone knows Boze belonged in that Sabrina bit.
So we are all going to agree that damien is a part of regular smosh now right
I love Brooklyn 99
That was impersonating Jake Peralta
Damian plays a pretty good role as Jon Snow from Game of Thrones
Its been a while since they made a good episode 😂
“Sabrina what are you doing here?”

pause

                      “Chilling”
I like how at the beginning they brought back the character from Every Period Ever
First btw love you so much and I always watch you
I was the 1mill viewer
Anthony Padilla should have been John snow😂
Can the robot vegan have his own video please??😂😂😂
They should’ve gotten Anthony to be Jon Snow
The accents 👌😂
ngl damien does a pretty good jon snow impression
You dare insult Brooklyn Nine Nine?
i think noah wouldve been a better jake peralta
You remember food battle you should do the same thing as in food battle but call it food fight
How dare you take out the original theme
I can’t believe you did that to Riverdale !😢😤
The Brooklyn 99 one omfg😂
The Sabrina joke really got me
Game of thrones btw
For true detective, I was just expecting them to show a picture of Pikachu. I like the one I made and the one they did
cant wait until rhett and link are on the next edition of try not to laugh!
OKAY OKAY I ATE THE LAST CHOCOLATE!! I JUST PANICKED OKAY???
Hey! Don't you dare make fun of twilight zone!
You guy's should do every dollar store ever.
Courtney as Steve is everything I’ve ever wanted
I love how Shayne is in all of these
Who clicked on this video just because of stranger things?✋🙋
Most of these are just Netflix shows
Can you do a react to the captions please they are super funny
Wait! What? They updated their channel icon.
1:18
He doesn't know
Yay it’s probably been a year of watching smosh
Few actors can change their voices as Shayne Topp. He's awesome.
2:30 when my teacher is talking🤪
Haha the brooklyn nine nine one was accurate
idk if it's because i grew up, or they just got really bad. Smosh just truly what happened
Watching parodys of shows I have never seen makes me wanna watch them
It isn't a good season of GoT however
The real smosh has been revised.
Alright, i admit. I never watched avengers: infinity war or endgame. People wouldn't stop asking me about it so i just said i did so they could stop asking.
#42 on trending street

1. Avengers: Endgame

Finally! The return Sgt. Anous
That is a very accurate version of Brooklyn nine nine
I loved watching Archie
they should do lucifer
If The Flash was real, Reverse flash comes and kill me.
Is it just me or I can see Shayne in almost every video,
It's not the same without Anthony saying "you know how stupid it would be if BLANK was real" best part about smosh😔
Smosh 
I miss mom ian mom
Her name is mom
first smosh video I liked since 2009
They should have got Anthony to play as John snow
Jon snow should've been Anthony YOU GUYS JUST MISSED

Im actually surprised ppl still watch this channel
Shayne is this a tampon???
I miss FOOD BATTLE!
DO SUPERNATURAL NEXT!!
SGT ANOUS IS BACK EYYYYYYYYYYY
Bring back Anthony 😫
Riverdale is a dumb dark adaptation of fluffy comic, Westworld is a robot brothel, Game of Thrones is..., The Twilight Zone is always too meta, stranger things is a by the numbers 80 science fiction show, And Sabrina is as accurate as the new Addams family movie that's coming out.

All in all, quality programming all around!
good job guys this is exactly how it is this is how many smosh  videos there are 
|
|
|
\/
Can you make a video on the 23rd?
Is it just me or does Ian sound like Donna from Brandon Rogers in the Brooklyn Nine Nine part?
Also where is Noah
I love you guys,
But i never laughed once...
SGT Anouse is back!! The come-back we didn't deserve, but the come-back we needed lmao
What is the soundtrack for chilling sabrina??
I give you all an A for effort
When I clicked on this video I was wondering if they would do Riverdale and it was the first one looool
Can you have unbrella academy in the next one
You didn't used the old intro?
I agree with Courtney Shayne is really hot😍😘😊
Hype for stranger things season 3!!!!!!
This is how many people love Smosh!
⤵️
Spraying hair spray on your hat, seems legit
4:07 BOOO!!!!😠😡(:Sorry Being Honest😔

James Charles just touches your balls
Like to undo
I'm A rOboT VirGiN!!
I like how Ian killed everyone 😂😂😂
Brooklyn 99 on point!
I love Sabrina spellman she is the best and I have seen Sabrina part 2
GoT may be the most nerdy yet normie show I've ever seen... Double negative
please make footbattle 2019
the floral shirt ian’s wearing looks good on him
Hey the Brooklyn 99 on is so off topic just don't show that
#15 on trending street
You guys shouldve gotten Anthony to play Jon Snow tbh
3:26 THANK ME LATER
Do a “Every Butler” (or) “maid ever”!!
I KILLED THEM OK!
YES THE SABRINA ONE!!! AHAHAH
I wish for Brooklyn 99 they just went and filmed an actual police precinct. Not that exciting. Lots of paperwork.
Pure gold
I MISS THE SCENE WHERE IAN AND ANTHONY SIT ON THE COUCH AND DISCUSSING HOW WEIRD IT WOULD BE IF TV SHOWS WERE REAL. IM SO SAD
3:32 - 3:39 LOL!😂
I got a Riverdale ad
Make this blue if you love Smosh
👇(I'm gifting at 3000 subscribers)
When I see the the twilight zone scene, I remember Anthony.
Ok how r these  pleps still making video's
Anthony padilla is john snow just kidding dont get mad
Canr wait  to my girl
Why did the smosh icon go yellow”
Any one notice Ian's cop name tag says Sgt. Anous (Anus).
What happened to Anthony
I love you smosh your my best friend
Do every post man ever
Wait a minute... Where's Anthony? 😱😥😥😥
I miss Anthony
Can you do Psych for the next one
the true detective is on point :)
That pun actually got me. Lol
The new channel art is dope
Is what riverdile i love
Nobody:

Literally nobody: 


Ok im serious NOBODY: 


Seriously NOBODY: 

Shayne: Is this where be bone robots???
I’m so exited for SMOSH SUMMER GAMES
i’d be better with
Ian and Anthony
Huh,neat
Teen Wolf is the best
I was at school when yall uploaded this vid
I missed SHUT UP
plot twist: the monsters in stranger things are just a collection of Steve's old hairspray cans
1:46 yup. That’s Peralta
I was hoping for GOT Anthony would be Jon Snow because of his recent video lmao
I just came for stranger things 😂
The first joke is crazy
It would have been funny if they had Anthony cameo as Jon Snow
Watching a Smosh video
Ok ok I killed my sister
You should make anthony jon snow only for this video that would be amazing
Patrick Warburton and Anthony do it better as the narrator from Twilight Zone.
You should add supernatural next time and just yell "SAM" "DEAN" across a road
U guys are 49th subscribed channel
How comes you didn't use Anthony for John Snow
Never have watched any of them. Feelin alienated...
This is more like shows in a nutshell
You should have Lucifer in here as well xD that would be funny to see.
Sabrina 🤣🤣🤣
What is this lame intro,miss the old introo 😢
Like if you agree
omg courtney looks just like sabrina

Courtney You Look Really Good When You have Long and Straight Hait.

I pressed on this as fast as I yeet my meat

This episode really starred Shane
Could you guys do every celebrity ever?

Small channel trying to grow
This is awesome! I’d love to see a if psych was real!

Brooklyn nine nine is so true.
Glad to see the "i miSs tHe oLd smOsh" comments stopped
wow
I want to c the 100
Please don't do brooklyn 99 like that. That wasnt necessary...
You guys should do Every Dollar Store Ever.
James Charles married you 








Like to divorce
The moment when you realize Ellen has more subscribers then Smosh...
IS THAT GUM!?!?!?
You should do Pokémon again
1:08 they should've asked Anthony to come real quick.
The song at the Sabrina part sounded familiar but I can’t remember what it’s called.
No 13 reasons why?
HEY!!! FFA jacket is represented @ 3:45
And is Damien in Smosh now
Logo change?
Yezzz the police that Ian did back in the o'l days is bak
Why didn’t Anthony play John snow he looks just like him🤔
#21 on trending street
I think we all need courtney to stop being so hot.
“ the bell might of saved you “
Wait omg is he the guy from the Goldbergs omg ahhhh!!!!!
I know Andy's last name its Padilla
Y’all really out chilling adventures in here lol...
Shayne and ian are the only good actor in smosh rn
These truly are stranger things 👍
I just skipped to the stranger things part cuz Idk the other shows
I remember when Ian would do something stupid at the start that Anthony would make a whole explanation then would show if shows or video games were real
1:01 alabama 100
I havent watched a single episode of a single show in here wtf happened to smosh
Can you pleaseeeee put Supernatural in the next If TV Shows Were Real if it hasn't been in it alreadyyyyyy

Youtube Is Drunk Again :(
So glad they finally did a Brooklyn nine nine joke
Omfg the river dale one tho
I've only watched Stranger things, lol.
How is jughead a derogatory term
Stranger things content while we wait
I literally have never watched any of them
13 reasons why pls
Make Every youtube drama ever
Shayne and Damien are far too talented to be in smosh, they both kill all their roles/impersonations.
*Netflix has entered the chat *
You guys really went off and did EVERY show huh
PLEASEEEEEEE! MAKE IF JIMMY NEUTRON WERE REAL!!!!
It’s good knowing gmm bought this channel. It’s sad that Anthony left tho.😢
Plz make Smosh live but not live
Netflix is a TV show now, But i watch it on my tablet
Smosh was better with just Ian and Anthony lol
For “ If Tv shows are real part 5” ( Kids shows) , you guys should add “Miraculous ladybug” and “ Star Vs Forces of Evil” in
They should just have smosh be ian, Anthony & Shayne
I REALLY WANT THE SHUT UP INTRO
Miss Anthony
That hunter x hunter music at the end lol
I get why they didn't do the regular intro where they introduce the topic of the video, Anthony left
1:58 Joe Beretta is back, baby! Nvm, false alarm.
do every rick and morty ever
I know that food battle is done but what about a food war
Smosh is actually a YouTube channel that I actually wanna watch cause it’s still got original creativity
ayyyyye brooklyn 99
The westworld one tho
For next tv shows in real life can you do The Act
I would be asleep but this is more important
Kinda shocked they didn't put Lucifer in this too haha
I really love Smosh😍😍
Food battle 2019
I’ve said once and I’ll say it always! We need more sketches with shirtless Shayne Topp!!!
if smosh was not real
Shayne's Andy Samberg is turning into Nicholas Cage
Smosh on recommended... Wow i haven’t seen this fossil for a while!
Is that ians old Cop character !??
Can u do every tiktok ever
CAN YOU GUYS MAKE EVERY DOCTER Ever
Who played Jon Snow that seemingly looks like Anthony Padilla.
You should do Glee
Yay Sergeant Anous returns again!!! 0:56
YASSS THE TWILIGHT ZONE

River dale is my fave show
1:37 leaked season 7
Who else misses the old intro to these?
Sg Anouse is back!
Except it hasnt been a good season... :'(
Ian looks good guys! Also Courtney's timing on the last joke just right 👌
Yall really came at B99 lmao
Why does Ian look like Joe Bereta😂
Why are most of these shows on Netflix
Almost everyone in the comment section  obviously just watched the first 4 episodes of B99 amirite?
Wtf happened to this channel, I haven’t watched a smosh vid in 6 yrs
sees B99
sings B99's Theme song
yes twilight zoneeee
wow that twilight zone joke stung, I swear that was almost word for word what someone said when I tried to tell them about the show
Shayne is on fire today
I miss the old smosh
I just realized after watching ‘new’ smosh for years that they got rid of the shut up thing
Smosh you should every game trailer ever
Is it bad that the only show here that I've seen is Brooklyn nine nine
Next up: Every CHALLENGE Ever
yeah chilling
That moment when the only thing you've seen on this list is The Twilight Zone
Ian looked just like Joe Berata
I want Anthony back.
Do every house ever or every police ever
IF YOUTUBE VIDEOS WERE REAL.
0:55
Didn't they already do Game of Thrones
This isn’t smosh anymore ma bois
It's funny how they showed The Twilight Zone and I was learning about it for my language arts drama subject lol
Hey smosh do Lucifer
The last one got me
I miss Smosh
Hello person scrolling down the comments in between scenes
Lmao, jughead is his real name, his dad was just a stupid drunk and named him that
No Supernatural i sad
I love you smosh but I also love riverdale
You guys should make one of theses but with superhero shows
1:33 to avoid Game of Thrones
Can you guys do one of “Lucifer”?
I liked this one
Love this so much!
Shayne x Courtney
You guys should make a video where Ian’s a cop like you guys did a while aho
13M for james charles. We better get the predator to 0 subs and to jail.
The riverdale one is not true
Where tf is Anthony?
anthony should have been jon snow
this is crazy man
anyone still ship courtney and Shayne
I miss Ian as a police officer he should do that more
+10 for damian's northron accent.
Damien as John snow yaaaaaaaassssss
Yep. If I had to listen to Matthew McConaughe talk I would confess to anything to get him to shut up.
U guys should do the Goldbergs time haha xD
Can you bring back part timers
Miss These if tv shows were real
0:30 I want him!
1:58 even my girlfriend is rake :(

How does Ian manage to get hotter every vid
I demand more Noah

Why is no one talking about that Mathew McConaughey impression
3:00 haha haha haha. That's so funny.
Shane was so good of impersonating Jake Peralta

I miss this smosh working with each other making funny vids and not every blank ever cause its getting old
Hey I got to tell ya your movie is awesome!

Man this video was a good one for Shayne huh
This is the first time in a while Ian plays a cop

0:20 ..what's the song playing behind ?
Did anyone else notice the fact Ian looked like Joe Bereta in the true detective skit
Please 😩
If only Anthony was here to play John snow
Do Impractical jokers
It’s funny how Shayne is the main character in basically every one. 😂
Can someone gif Shayne bouncing his pecks I feel the need to have that...
you guys have been in the 20m subs for years
How is Smosh still a thing
Courtney looks a lot like Sabrina
Every KFC Ever Anyone?
Jon snow is Anthony Padilla
I wish they did the TV show Lucifer
No Anthony no if tv shows were real
Way did’nt you Do i zombie
M-My name is Jamie......I slept with my sister?
Are they using the Mr. Bean theme at 3:59?
I miss Jon Snow Anthony.
I miss when Anthony use to be in this
What happened to Noah?
I feel like that’s pretty much just their opinion of shayne tbh
Still gotta say, best episode of The Twilight Zone is when the guy looses his glasses and can't read his books
Can you do smosh with anthony
Watch them reboot food battle next
I love Riverdale
Yeah brooklyn nine nine wooo
who misses the og smosh
i want part timers back
Tell Anthony to join smosh
I miss the old jingle from the other if blank was real series with Ian and Anthony. But tbh you guys are doing way better now without him, I'm so happy smosh got revived!
Do every naruto ever
Why hasn't SPN been in one
Kто русский? Ставьте лайк

But the real issue here is

Alright i killed the dog ok
2:17 me in math class
where is lucifer
My great granpa was in the twilight zone he was the mane star in the episode flip a penny
god don’t bless this

If TV shows were real the bloopers would be in them
courtney is a pretty hot robot.
I have seen only one of these
Lemme guess: Shayne wrote this episode
I don’t know half these shows
Had an idea. A video where you imitate other youtubers, both their past versions and present. And then make a imitation of old smosh and then have Anthony come back just one time. Or forever is possible, but we all just wanna see him again just one last time.
I can not believe they did stranger things
This is NOT smosh.
lucifer needs to be on here
Guys do  every gamer ever
It’s weird seeing them around mythical studios
I miss the old smosh 😢
How did they get adds on this?
What was the song used in the riverdale one?
49 the robot blink sorry this comment is bad
Jughead???

return the pink smosh logo
every Netflix ever?
Not one laugh. I miss smosh.
Indonesia ??
Better have the office in it
😅😅😅sno doesn’t know😂
That FFA Jacket @3:28 though
if smosh now is not owned by a company that suppresses their ideas then why anthony is not coming back because he left smosh due to not getting freedom of expression
The Sabrina one was so funny
Maybe it’s just me but does anybody else feel like Noah Olivia and Keith are slowly getting in less videos and less time on screen
OMG this is like a Shayne bonanza. ...So many Shayne scenes...nohomo.
You guys need to do every field trip ever
Do every smoosh ever

For a start I love this place in a world of the wild things of gumball and roll out the streets and roll up the amazing w the best in a country with great pride 3rd in the 33rd century and the rest of the world is a great place to live and to be a great place to live and to be a great place to live and 333 to be a great place to live and 3AM in girl for a long period 66inches
Smosh is so smoshy
The twilight zone tho

What is da song
Me: I’m sorry the old smosh can’t come to the phone right now

Random person: why?

 Me: cause Anthony’s  not here

Random person: AHHHHH
"Also we look hella old now"
basically the kids in season 3
This is the best if tv shows were real ever.
I loved it, so good.
Stranger things:* says nothing*








Awww
Is Noah still a part of Smosh? Correct me if I'm wrong but he hasn't been part of Smosh or Smosh Pit vids for a good few weeks now.
Shayne is too much for me😂
Maybe do Umbrella Academy next if you could and I know you may not see this but I was hoping in the next one maybe do it because it is an amazing series.....Also you guys are the most amazing YouTubers I have ever met do thank you for creating such good content
Oh God, the wig Damien is wearing on the stranger things but hahahahahaha
Gfgcdacvb like ples
Stranger Things!
Anthony should have played John snow...
Anyone else notice shayne was in every single skit
i just saw b99 and i don’t think i’ve been this happy in a while
I would die if TV shows were real.
NINE NINE
where's the start where ian starts complaining and then anthony says it would be stupid if all movies were realistic
Every pet ever
You are the baest
The old cop!
Two Disney stars
They have they same subs

As james Charles dislikes
Can you imagine what the work would be like if TV shows were real?

insert if every __ were real theme
It should of been;
If TV shows were 4 real
Archie: takes off shirt
Veronica: daddy
Hiram and Archie: Yes? 



in season 3


Archie 
Veronica: i have a boyfriend
Archie: Okay 
I’ve waited so long for this
YOU GUYS SHOULD DO THE 100 NEXT TIME
That friggen Chilling Adventures of Sabrina bit got a chuckle outa me.
I have a classmate who tortured me for weeks and she is addicted to Riverdale, this video would make a great revenge. 
Thanks Smosh
I like how Courtney was wearing and FFA jacket
Woah!!! Is that GUM!!!
That was season 1 season 3 is very different
do greys anatomy ;-;
I love brooklyn nine nine. Good video smosh
Ha 1:05 Jamie Lannister
SGT. ANUUUUUUUUUUS!!!!!
i love Sabrina
im i the only one that realizes that Shayne  plays the weirdos
Do the 100 pleaseeee
I think that Smosh has birthed a new character with the Yellow Hat Boy. It's a character manifestation of when Shayne made fun of Courtney for the whole "when you sit on ketchup" thing
What’s the name of the intro song
I haven't even seen 95% of these TV Shows yet but Smosh posted a new vid, I had to watch it. Great Vid tho😊
This was freaking amazing
Smosh died when Anthony left
James Charles touched you

Like to undo!
.
.
.
.
Next one do teen wolf
You should do a every Tik tok every
I can't wait for season 3 of stranger things
Do Lucifer next!!!!!!!
Loved the Brooklyn nine nine one
If anime was real
Was it just me or was this the longest 5 minute videos ever
Can u do every extreme couponer ever?
This series is great
“Chilling”
2017: In 2019 anthony will return back to the old Smosh again
2019: Flying cars!
Who else imagined a dialogue between Ian and Anthony that they are talking about how stupid it will be if tv shows were real?
They really started off with Riverdale-
riverdale is true
Shayne is a snack!
I love Brooklyn nine nine
I know that shayne came into office and said:
Look what I can do! And did he twitched his pecs. And somebody said: 
We have to put that into a video!
leave this series alone, guys - unless Anthony comes back and smosh goes back to the original
1:00 AND SAME WITH THE OLD COP PERSONA
Best vid in a while! you nailed each show!
I came back for the nostalgia of the series
this was your best video recently
Has shayne bounced his pecks like that before?
Brooklyn Nine Nine BOIIII! 😃😃😃😃😃
I wonder what they would've done with the TV show Lucifer..🤔🤔
Brooklyn nine nine is amazing
yES BROOKLYN NINE NINEEEE
Do one of supernatural
Where is Merlin and supernatural
4 robot ghostbusters? The yelling Shanes are taking over! I’m a robot virgin
You guys should get Ryan Reynolds on Try Not To Laugh!
Where are Noah Keith and Olivia like they haven’t been in anything lately
RIVERDALE¡!!!!!!!!
What happend to john snow
What happened to Keith and Noah
Screw horror movies
Does anyone elsethink the ian looked like joe.
Waiting for Sabrina to say "chilling" and it happened 😂😂😂 Courtney's deliveries as Ms.Maizel and Sabrina were pretty good
You should play smashbros
We should get a name for that guy that goes WOAH MAN IS THAT A _____. He should be the woah man
I was hoping to see shayne as lucifer and courtney as chloe decker from Lucifer.
I MET SHAYNE AT DAVE&BUSTERS DENVER ON THE 28TH OF DENVER

Every karate class ever
Stranger things is by Stephen king
My favorite videos are the ones where Keith is a girl!

Thr riverdale one was on point
Anthony = John Snow
2:10 looks like prince Harry lol
Why do people watch this
I haven’t watched any of the shows so I don’t know the references or anything but I’m still gonna like it
Does anyone remember the last time you laughed at a Smosh video?
Anthony Padildo is the only real Jon Snow!
The riverdale on is the best
Where's American Horror Story????
You should do every honey moon ever or every divorce ever
What happened to Anthony padilla
Wait...

YASSSSs❤️❤️❤️

Are Noah, Olivia, and Keith trying to leave Smosh? They haven’t had much screen time in the last couple of months as much as their other cast members.
Riverdale you are so wrong
Every HnM maybe?
I feel like Shayne hijacked the entire video xD
What doesn't john snow knows??
Those 222  Dislikes are the producers of those shows
I've noticed Noah, Keith and Olivia have been getting fewer and fewer roles in Smosh videos lately. Anyone know why?
Courtney: “Wait aren't you supposed to  be Jordan Peele” 
Shayne: WHAT?!
😂😂😂
LMAO. You can see Courtney trying not to laugh in the Westworld scene. 😂💀
Okay but the impression of John Snow was SPOT ON
DAMN! Way to drag Stranger Things!!😂
Next episode


If anything was real
I love The Twighlight Zone :D
This video is now my home
courtney as steve harrington might be the best thing i’ve ever seen
I think not having Netflix is why I barely understood this video at all...
0:57 - James Charles 👏
I’m too young to understand any of these jokes
Song at 4:02?
It’s not the same without Anthony😔😭😔
Where’s Noah?!!!
I love riverdale but it's true
2019 anybody
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Has smosh changed?
Only know about stranger things and Sabrina  twilight zone every other show never heard off .also first watching this channel
En español por qué no entiendo ni madres
SYNCED UP SQUAD WHERE YOU AT ❣️
“Don’t be so dramatic.” He pretty much just signed his death warrant.
Simple way to explain a period
1. Uterus wants a baby
2. Uterus doesn’t get a baby
3. Uterus is angry
4. Uterus wants revenge
Just imagine shayne shouting in a microphone
Super over-enthusiastic cashier dude is my new favorite character
“It feels like Edward scissor hands is in my uterus”


🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Omg! I died!!!
No one:
Literally no one:
Absolutely no one:
The whole Earth population:
Shayne:
I think YouTube knows my cycle.. the minute I got my period it recommends this 🤔
Probably the best video I've seen in a long time!


"IS THAT A TAMPON?!" had me deceased
I'm 15 and still haven't had my period




Wait im a boy
No one:
Literally no one:
Absolutely no one:
The whole Earth population:
smosh:








at least im not pregnant tho
At least im not pregnant should be the line on every tampon commerical in existence 😂😂😂
Only true smosh fan know




Man-spider
You should make "WOAH IS THAT A TAMPON?" merch.
No one:
Literally no one:
Men about periods: AHHHH
I started my period the day this video came out...coincidence? I think not
"At least I'm not pregnant, though!" - me every time
This video was published the week of my first period. Coincidence? I think not.
I literally got my Period 2days ago. This made my week, Thank you🙏🏼😂
0:47 you know your true friends when you have your period together
1:05 Korea's law states that period counts as a sick day in work environment but no one uses it since it looks 'unprofessional' to supervisors 
WTF
Where the heck is Courtney FREAKIN Miller she’s always on her period 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
BY FAR, THIS IS THE MOST RELATABLE THING I SAW IN THIS CHANNEL
My male teachers and male classmates never questioned why I had to bring my backpack to the bathroom.
Funny sketch though it did feel that way😂
"GOD I'M SO LONELY"
Story of my life
Courtney Miller would be the best Disney princess ever.
I like how Shayne works at a drug store, then he just shows up at the school XD
My period is gonna be synced up with exam week 😒
1 pray for mulan that stopped the invasion of the nuns 
Thats the kind of history that deserves to be teached in schools 4:47
2:30
The dad was actually me when I got my first period
Every tick tock ever
Every Chick-fil-A ever
Every mime ever 
Every company ever
Every College ever
Every ghost ever
Mulan fighting off the nuns has to be the most underrated joke in this video.
Me in middle school: I need to change my pad but if i go to the bathroom with my backpack on then EVERYONE will know i’m on my period!!

😂😂😂 why tho?
If Shayne was still working at that pharmacy:
Shayne: aRe ThOsE cOnDomS
I know its alot the hair the BoD WhEn YoUr StArInG aT a DeMy GoD
“WOAH IS THAT GUM” 
“YEAH!!” Etc.
You guys missed the perfect opportunity to use courtney freaking miller 🤣🤣
“Mr. Grouch, I need to use the bathroom with Marisa’s backpack.”



-Courtney Miller 2019
3:20 For a moment I Thought i saw Joe Bereta LOL.
You know what's funny? That it got uploaded right when I got my period :-)
No one: 
Absolutely no one:
Shayne:Is ThAt GuM?!?!
4:55
How me and the bois pass around the juul
Omg they do they always have people having tennis in period commercials
drops tampon 
Everyone looks at it 
Walks in WOAH IS THAT A TAMPON 😂😂😂😂
I wore a uniform which had pockets so hiding a pad when I needed to use the bathroom was easy. 
Here are a few ways to hide your pad/tampon:
1) Under your sleeve
2) In your pocket
3) In your bra
4) Top part of your pants/shorts/skirt
5) Double pad
This was posted the day I got my period

Coincidence?
That first scene is soo true. I immediately get a pimple and bloated for 2 days.
If you say to a girl “looks like someone’s on her period” you’re just digging your own grave
I love how “i must sharpen my pencil” was said
Keep it up this video was honestly very comedic and relatable so props to you guys on that
They missed a perfect opportunity of showing how much the good tampons and pads cost
Every papa johns ever
Every Pizza Hut ever (idk if u did this already)
Every YouTube comment ever 
Every pokémon ever
Every Costco ever
Every Netflix show ever
Me: I don't get it.
Friend: omg this is so relatable.
I've been wonting this tip of video you years
"It feels like Edward Scissor Hands is in my uterus." 😂😂
I loved it when shane said "M SO LONELY :D"
Periods:
Your body getting mad that you’re not pregnant
I was watching this and I sneezed. Gtg ask my teacher that never lets anyone leave to go to the bathroom. If he says no it’s going to get real weird for him
Nobody:
Smash: eVeRy PeRiOd EvEr
I can't relate yet
I have to have fun before my period last
You should do every star sign on their period.
IS THAT GUM? YA ! WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? OVER THERE!! IT COMES IN PACKS OF THREE? 





I MUST SHARPEN MY PENCIL!
Shayne: WOW ARE THOSE TAMPONS!!??
Shayne: IS THAT GUM?!?!?!
Shayne:👁👄👁 is that a tampon?
Period starts on the 20th... and ends on the 28/30

Synced up with anyone?
There are no loyal b*tches! Lol
HEY EVERYONE THIS GUY IS GETTING TAMPONS!!!!!!!

GOD I'M SOO LONELY!
The weird thing is that today we had the puperty talk
i relate to this video on an emotional level.
Suspense
Shane:WHOA! Is that a tampon?
It's like being pregnant
Best explanation I have
This made me uncomfortable 10/10 would watch again
Do every school field trip ever!!!!!!! It would make my day 🤗😋🤗😋
I'm glad Smosh is drawing attention to the importance of punctuation. 
Periods are no joke, people.
The dad situation, my dad would be the calm one and I'D be the one freaking out 😂
someone drops a tampon     tampon guy WOAH IS THAT TAMPON
The dad freaking out is soooooo accurate
I have a Question for you, Smosh: What’s a Period and what is it for?
Starts period in class
Me: may i go to the bathroom Mr. Smith?
Mr. Smith: no. you can't go during a test. you can hold it for 15 more minutes.
Me: that's not how it works
You forgot one thing: BLUE LIQUID
look at 2:25
and then pause and look at Olivia's face(its creepy)
nobody: 
Shayne: IS THAT A TAMPON???!!
2:30 
Pretty much my reaction...
Your next every ____ ever should be every volleyball game ever!!!
This is all me but I fall on the ground and cry until I die
2:30 is the most accurate part of this whole video.
Shayne reminds me of Ryan Hansen lol idk y
My ocd want off at the beginning
Shoutout to the prolly 80% males watching this video.
Woah is that a tampon!?
This was happening to me in science
What a coincidence, the day after I watched this I had my first period.

5:53 “Is that a tampon!” Killed it 😂😂🤣😭💀☠️
Who else is watching this on your period? 😂🙌
I literally started for the first time at sewing class...
I remember when my pad flew out of my bag and one of the boys walked up to it and picked it up, he then turned to me and asked "What is this?"
Those were the best outtakes in the history of Smosh
I got my period today, and YouTube somehow knew? Thank you for the recommendation!
The end of the video killed me ... IS THAT GUM!   
YEA!!
WHA U GET THA GUUUM!!?

Tip: Wear high boots so you can slip a pad or tampon in the side of your boot. 
Got a lot of “thank yous” from my peers. No one suspects a thing.
There's only one way to prevent periods and that's getting their tubes tied.

I don’t know if this is your guys’s decision or some else’s but it’s probably not the greatest idea for your name to slander company’s. I do think it’s funny it might throw off other people

Can’t really hate Burger King since my grandpa used to take me there for good behavior or if he was hungry Still eat it though 😅
Still unhealthy af but BK Burgers taste better than McDonald’s. McDonald’s just has better tasting fries.
Y’all be joking on what about a burger queen well we have a dairy king

Number 15: Burger King foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo, anonymously, to the site, showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce, with the statement, "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on - but that's even worse.
The chips are the best at burger king where I live
You can Still have it Your Way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What kind of bread?
I love burger king
Number 15 Burger King foot lettuce the last thing you want on you’re Burger King burger is someone’s foot fungus

This is the first smosh video I've ever disliked. Because in Canada I've never been to a single burgerking that has stuff like this happen and Burger king is literally so much better than McDonald's. I guess MacDonald might have paid smosh to make this.
This Was Just A Diss On Burger King When It's Better Than Mc Donalds.
I actually think hungry jacks is the tastiest
Aww Noah's little chops
Stop making every (blank) ever. Make funny stuff like you used to before.
2:13
I'm a manager at Burger King, we're suing you
Wheres Anthony?

Do every Doctor ever. Just a suggestion.
You forgot one thing when the Burger King 3 pieces tender is as hard as a rock
The bacon king is better than a big mac
Next every kfc ever
I actually had a burger king advertisements before the video started
Hungry Jacks (Aussie BK) has really good chips, better than McDonald’s, but not as good as Kfc
I haven't experienced fast food that is in Canada while I was in the United States, so I haven't experienced this level of crap
I think they r just hating on burger king ahaha I live in Australia we don't have burger king
Idk about the Americas, but literally everywhere else I've been, BK is waaay better than McDonalds
I actually like whoppers...
Every Tim Horton’s ever
Wait is this McDonalds?
Duh, sure!
When Courtney said “I’m Captain Marvel” I was expecting Zachary Levi to show up.
1:00 Shayne as Captain America is great
That line, "Well you're a weird fleshy color but i don't bring that up for you...so..."
Thanos' and Kia's interaction must be a series. That shit is golden. I could watch it all day.
Damien is such a good improvisor
The real reason why thanos snap and wipe out half the universe
2:10 
I don’t wanna that guy, but stormbreaker was Beta Ray Bills weapon, not Thor’s, so if you cou-
captain marvel shoots me
She actually looks like captain marvel
Why is Captain Marvel dressed like a Cadbury's Creme Egg?

2:35


"You like AC/DC
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH!"
still waiting for that livestream of damien playing with rocks

For anyone who wants to see the episode it’s ep 21 season 1
smosh should make a joke  about NASA .  that NASA are planing to send  micheal jackson  to the moon to do the moon walk .
Smosh Taking Advantage of the Endgame hype LOL
dr strange: you don't even need a prescription for that
Cap: i don't want the 200 mg ones I want th-
dr strange: you don't need that because your steroids literally help you anyways
I miss the shut up intro😿😭😢
I can’t be the only one who wants Lunchtime with Smosh back right?
If marvel characters were real they
Would be doing wat they are now
Omg lol Spider-Man😂 also Noah is perfect for that roll!
IF UNIVERSE SANDBOX 2 WAS REAL ^^ make that one
The sad thing is they changed the ORIGINAL logo. Of their channel.
Doctor strange was definitely the funniest in this
WHEN THANOS SNAPPED HIS FINGERS MY IPAD WAS AT THE TEN BATTERY WARNING WAS AT 10 PERCENT LOL WHAT A Coincidence. Lol
Every since one letter off books they haven’t used the shut up intro 
.  .
)—
Thanos: snaps fingers and eliminates half of the universes population
Thanos: "hahaha! I have succee-- wait what? What's happening?"
thanos disintegrates unfortunately being a part of the random half
Joke:
Why does thanos have a team?
Because he is giant grape
Since when thanos sound like Morgan Freeman
COURTNEY LOOKS GOOD AS CAPTAIN MARVEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love how its called "if Marvel characters were real" lol they already are
I just went back to watch your first video.
Courtney looks great in that captain marvel outfit!
Captain Marvel was Shazam before DC had to switch it to Shazam for good
Courtney makes the best Captain Marvel 💙
Nobody:
Absolutely Nobody:
Nerd:BUT THEY ARE REAL
At first that guy really looked like chris evans
At first, Shayne looked EXACTLY like Captain America!!
2:08



Captain America: 




 Thor: 
Should do a drivers 1989 vs 2019
Why’s Damian always the bald people 👨🏻‍🦲
Ian is perfect for Ant-Man!
Change my Mind
😂
clicked as fast as I could I almost fell off my chair
HELLO ITS TIME TO DO IANS PART FROM THE CLIFFHANGER OF “ EMO HAIR “, BECAUSE HE DOESNT HAVE A BOWL CUT ANYMORE
Literally when the notification came up on my phone I screamed and yelled “OMG EEEEEEK!”  And threw my phone sorry if that’s a lot
How anime characters will react in a scary movie. eg. naruto vs  Jaso, sasuke vs freddy, goku vs the exorcist, Luffy vs .... and so on and so on
Thanos can say the N-Word

Reality can be whatever he wants...
O1:42 Family Guy did it.
Courtney would actually have been good as captain marvel
She actually looks like Captain Marvel!
Captain Marvel is the best because she’s a freaking tank
Antman crawling up Thanos' arsehole is a very real threat for Thanos
Wow Ian is Stanley now
Captain marvel should be a guy
HAHAHHAHA if you could throw in some oxys too that'd be cool
Glad to see Smosh on trending again. Love from Australia
ive never clicked off of coolmaths games as fast
Thor has his old hammer in end game
Captain marvel wasn't a guy in the comics!
If they were real they would look like the movie,
Why does Courtney look like captain marvel
Play the newlywed game again except Courtney and Shayne together, Noah and Olivia together, and Keith and Damien together lol
Docter strange is my favorite
I haven't seen a Smosh video in a minute, when did they get rid of the intro
Shayne as Captain America
Hot damn.
Captain Marvel was the most accurate, she couldn't handle any criticism.
Dad these avengers are GRUNKY. THEN DON'T WATCH THEM SON
He said a weird fleshy- 🤭😂😂😂
big fan of this whole blending of the smosh/smoshgames family because it leads to Damien and Olivia being Damien and Olivia at each other and that's never a bad thing.
The new captain Marvel is far better than Carol.
Do every tic tik ever
damien's tendancy to say 'what's up?' managed to sneak it's way into this video and I love it
so um shayne topp is chris evans
I was expecting Ian to come on when Thanos was on and say that he had the infinity stones in the wrong slots haha.
Srsly tho some1 pls fix it
Anthony is in the battle royal by mister beast with jaiden and james
Every signer supports me with a lot of thanks
Finally another Marvel Smosh video! Awesome 😎.
The BTS scene was hilarious! :D
OMG THIS WAS MADE ON MY BDAY 😯
It’s funny how Thor actually gets his hammer back 🔨 and he got his long hair back
Shayne as Steve is great lmao
Courtney should have been cpt marvel in the mcu
Nerdy Ian forgot that in the comics Thor still has his hammer not storm breaker
Where is the old nerdy guy in red!
We want him back!!!
0:27 Mrs. Kree. I don't feel so good.
Ian being desintegrated by Captain Marvel twice by ranting about the characters. XD
Finally something not Every [Blank] ever
2:10 I wanted Thor to say :
"I like this one"
so badly
If they used ct.marvels man version people would literally confuse him with the Shazam movie and its best to try to be at least a little different from DC
Would’ve been better if Thanos snapped HIMSELF out of existence
0:45 what he was trying to say is captain marvel is the guy in dc who says Shazam.
Like - Captain Mar-Vel
Reply - Captain Marvel
Who knew Peter was packen👀👀
Production quality really dipped
I’ve watched all of [Every Blank Ever]
Congrats you're trending 36 wow
you guys look so similar to the real marvel characthers.
good job!
its 15th trending UK
Thanos:snap 

Me: nooooooooo my life is bad from thanos
imagine anthony and ian just popped their heads up and were like: "WE'RE BACKKKK!"








nope. but i still love u smosh
Continue videos of thanks and Kia relationship it’s soooooo good
I just watched S1 EP22 of Henry Danger and guess who I saw..... SHAYNE TOPP!
Marvel Studios is my favorite Pizza place
I want a smosh sitcom series where they all have the same name as real life but they arent them they have a story have reassuring people like smosh games members

Each episode goes for 10-20 minutes and 10-20 ish episodes (all depending on how long they want to make the episodes a season/s)

Ian: a weird landlord that lives with them

Shayne: full of himself later to realise that he isn't perfect

Keith: musician and oddball doesn't like Shayne but then become friends and is Noah's best friend

Noah: story based around his life just moved out of his mom's basement and only one who realises that finds it weird that Ian lives with them

Olivia: Courtney's best friend and loves cooking

Courtney: Shayne's sister who just happens to move in the same house as him

The first episode they all move into Ian's house who is renting rooms to them


(Does anyone have any other ideas?)
Yeah this is a great video and all but captain marvel makes me sad
Actually captain marval was Shazam
Plz bring Stevie back he's the best
MORE BTS!!!! this week in smosh was so good!
SHANE YOU WERE IN THE GOLDBERGS!!!
It’s just another video that saying WATCH US!!
Shazam was named Captain Marvel right?
2:08 Well, Stormbreaker IS a hammer. Just with an axe.
The orgin captain marvel is marvel, the assistance is ms.Marvel but when the original one die ms.marvel become captain marvel
EVERY GRUB HUD EVER
Olivia and Damien are so devoted to their act😂
Can you hace video km ELSMOSH soy español
Damiens English accent was really good
Damiens English accent was really good

Excellent improv at the end
Proffessor is not from marvel, still great video
Who’s also excited for Endgame
Mr. Stark, I don’t feel so g0oD
Ahh such a beautiful day
When Thanos snapped his fingers half of the universe became 1/4 of the universe
Cap looks real 😍
WHERE IS IRON MAN?!
Oh look, Courtney's in the thumnail again. What a surprise.
Shayne actually does look like Steve Rodgers lol
i need more oxycodone 😂😂

🦸🏼‍♂️🇺🇸 is a snich
Thank you you've officially help me to leave YouTube for good
2:27 made me crack up LOL

tHaNoS CaR
Remember when Smosh was funny? Anthony remembers.
I think smosh was better when Anthony was here....
Shane is jack sparrow from that’s so random
YES SHANE I KNOW YOUR SECRET
sees smosh video about marvel

we're in the endgame now
I agree with Ian I think captain marvel should be a dude if he was in the comics
2:08, acts like a true fan, calls Mjolnir "thor's hammer".
captai marvel was only a man in dc comics though
How hard was it to do Damien’s makeup
The legend says that captain marvel is a transgender
F4 credit scene
Doctor Strange his beard is really big
You should do 5th grade vs. 1st grade
Love ur vids so much
Proffesor x is DC but ohk
What's the deal with captain marvel and shazam. Like isn't his name captain marvel too?
kia is an icon



(sorry if i spelled her name wrong)
Can you please make more Smosh Baby please every one what’s it 🙂🙂🥺🥺
Captain marvel is a man his Shazam

Mat Bradley
Who invited Captain Marvel 😒
Ant Man joke was hilarious
Captain marvel is poo now
wait, Smosh still uploads?

SORRY A MISSED IT
I sense the lack of creativity in these videos, I guess you should bring back anthony for more brain power
I miss the "shut up intro"
I was expecting to see the old smosh intro because it wasn't an every blank ever video
0:41 Roll Credits!
2:17 y'know I was hoping for Thor to say " I like this one" like in the Endgame trailer.
Can you please make a "If People Were Anime" again
*avengers
thanos is rocking that jacket :3
SMOSH is doomed without Anthony
If Superheroes and Villains Were Real 2019 (still miss Anthony?)
captain marvel made this video 100 times worse
Smosh really changed
0:49 Shazam the movie is a thing tho
Too many captains. Demote Cpt. Marvel to Lftnt. Marvel

So... Where's my boi Ant man?
3:09 I love how Olivia had to say what they were talking about.😂
Kia,
Quida,
THANOS vs DEATHNOTE
How are the endings consistently the funniest parts
I'd get myself in danger just to have Courtney save me 😍😏
Flexed
When captain marvel showed up the guy that said captain marvel is a man in comics he might be thingking of shazam because hes name was captain marvel and changed it to shazam
Can you do DC
Hahahah lol i just watch avenger endgame..
Nice chin Damian
This vid was published on my birthday
I still miss Anthony
Why does Thanos sound like Gustavo Fring?
I miss Anthony those old days
Thor has always been Thor odinson
Reality is often disappointing
Damn ian i didnt know you read comic books
What about the SHUT UP intro
Good job on top 12
That end blooper was the best skit in this video tbh
Been wait forever for Avenger : Endgame
1:34 Is The Best One
The end was super funny. Another Awesome video!
Damien's the real MVP.
I still miss Anthony
If blank were real aint just the same without Anthony

This is how many people love smosh skeches
👇🏻
I miss Anthony:(
One of the few times I’ve seen smash on trending

I like how you make them all look like jackasses except Captain Marvel. Because wahmen.
Make this a full blooper than I'll sponsor you
Thanos sound more like bane
0:47
Technically technically, Shazam changed his name to Shazam, and the male you are referring to is called Mar-vel
I love the voice of the guy who played Thanos  is deep 😍
The male captain Marvel was actually captain Marval
if thanos was real, then half the universe would be dust
The Captain marvel part lost me
BUT I WANT THE BIG OOOONES
That's actually true, since Fox signed a deal with Disney, so I guess it's possible for it to happen.
The marvel was never a guy in the comics
I miss the toorooroorooroororotoroo music Like if you miss them too
I guess you could say that Anthony got snapped :(
I remember when smosh was good...miss those days
I didn't even notice the really nut looing chin on Thanos! LMAO
Thanos is Human Resources 😄
I want anthony back now that smosh is independent!
Jeeez i just hate comic nerds...
Ian looks like he should be wolverine
Neat where’s my coffee
Ian looks just like ant-man
Wait these guys still upload
Only have of my family and friends would be alive
Oh my god please tell me that ending clip with Olivia and Damien was improv! They did sooo well in that, it was so good! 😂
You used the star hawk soundtrack
Literally no nerd or comic fan complained abt a female captn marvel...
More Courtney as Cpt Marvel!
There are two captain marvel in the comic theres captain marvel and captain mar'vel
I gonna watch endgame
That Thanos cosplay was so hilarious
Thanos is a fool🤣
Thor was a real person along with Odin and Loki they just didn't have superpowers.
Smosh in spanish ¡pleace!

People that just got the notification Where you at?
I miss the old smosh intro
Anthony will always be remembered
ITS NOT THE SAME WITHOUT THE 2 MAIN STARS
Ya know from me being sick for four years I’ve discovered how funny this channel is
There’s two Captain Marvels, the OG DC comics captain and Marvel comics captain
Thamien Hanoss is so good
Captain America doesn't need anything to relieve soreness, he never gets sore. The serum was designed to constantly heal itself and him so he never gets sore or exhausted
"Mmm dammit, Kia."
I still miss Anthony lol
Is Damien a part of smosh cast now? Or still only smosh games....
I got the horses in the back

(sing along with me)
I love this, but Damian as Thonas looked like a wrinkled old purple bean bag. Keep up the cool skits.
Ian as Wolverine haha!
Wtf happened to smosh🤦‍♂️
Please!!! If exaggeration was real
Wheres Food battel 2019
Can You do every surgery ever?

I miss Charlie : (
for captain marvel i thought that captain marvel wasnt actually the name of the main character but the scientist woman (i forgot her earth name) who’s name is Mar-vel who i assume is the REAL captain marvel! (cue everyone calling me an uncultured swine who knows nothing about marvel lore)
my excuse: i dont read the comics. i just watch the movies :/
Umm actually, Captain Marvel has always been a woman in the comics. The man you are referring to is Captain Mar-Vell!
Courtney could play a much better Carol Danvers
This chanell died years ago who remember just the 2 of them

Lmao smosh is really back

Thanos was freaking hilarious
Wow some people in this channel actually look like the characters

r/triggered
It's pretty neat how Courtney and cap. Marvel look so alike
Their character roles are perfect for them
I miss Antony :(
Smosh, the white knight of captain marvel
Who else thinks Smosh should make "If DC characters were real" 😇❤
Ohhh I can't catch up with smosh lately. What happened to their 'SHUT UP!' intro skit?
It looks crap
Who miss anthony :(
Wolverine and xavier part was the best
Smosh please bring the bloopers and behind the scene back
Can you do a 'ever binge ever' and for example one of them could be a person getting so much food to watch a show
Like Thanos best
Do a every model ever
This will get claimed
You guys should collab with Anthony palladia
Courtney looks so pretty
I was expecting "i like this one" 2:18
I saw the power ranger theme video
Lol I said in their music vid to thank the viewers that Shane looked like Steve Rodgers and he’s playing Steve Rodgers in this!?!😂😂😂😂😂😂👌👌
I’ve never seen a channel fall off so much . Ever since y’all lost Anthony smh
Do if dc was in real life
If it was real we would all ready be ded
Did you put a popped bubble gum bubble on His chin for thanos
You’re welcome 😊
Food Battle 2019?????
Doctor strange was definitely the funniest in this😂😂😂
Stormbringer not stormbreaker. I'm not sure if it was a mistake or on purpose but I enjoyed the video. So fun to watch
I liked Thanos character in here the most😂
What if thanos snapped and Amish was gone
You guys should do every soccer player ever
U should do every steamer ever
Why those Thanos sound like Vision
its scary how alike shayne and chris evans look
I miss Anthony
Marvel characters is my favorite pizza place
Wolverine is dc not marvel.
THIS VIDEO IS BANNED DUE TO ARTICLE 13
The guy who played Thanos was hilarious
I missed the old smosh
I thought Noah was Tobey M. For a sec
0:40 still better than Brie Larson
This is such a great opportunity for the person who wrote the jokes for Marvel because their jokes are relatable
Ian is working with new people...Please bring back Anthony  in Smosh 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I said the wrong
i died tot he interaction between dr strange and captain america cause thats a good one
Heres an idea for your next video you could do every bowling alley ever
Food battle 2019
I miss anotny
@#$&%
marvel characters r real wtf
But captain marvel wasn’t a man in the comics
This has to be a series
Captain Marvel does not exist.
Remember when Ian post that inbarising video about Anthony
I'm such a marvel fan and this just buttered my toast.
What if Kia drives a Kia
wow they made captain marvel even less likable
Snap snap
Didn’t laugh one time
why do u use so many... bad words?
It is funny how Steve Rogers actually runs like that
Smosh should do an Every every blank ever Ever
Hey can you add odd1out
every K-pop ever like Kill This Love , Boy with luv, What is love, Tempo, Shine, Killing me, and 365 FRESH
25 seconds ago•5 views
I get Ian point, Cpt.Marvel was originally a man, but they call him by Shazam, the other Cpt.Marvel was Miss Marvel
When the video started i got a Marvel Ad..
I Miss Anthony
ur videos r funny and awesome
This is gonna get on Trending, you know it!
wait i thought captain marvel was a woman in the comics too, im confused
Whats this what if bs? Hawkeye is real and his name is lars andersen
So is everyone going to ignore the fact that Keith disintegrated first (It's not a horror movie xd)
Do y’all genuinely find this entertaining?
I subscribed
Lol " And your a weird fleshy colour "
Only people who remember stevie can like this
hahaha loved this one hahaha
Bang Olivia is cute
Where’s the intro
No Anthony :(
Hey where’s Anthony he’s my favourite member of smosh
What has smosh become😣😣
So Cap has a drug problem.
"Shut up!"
Do “ if DC characters are real”
薩諾斯 才不會這樣呢😢
My favorite is seeing Noah as Doctor Strange
WHERES MY ANTHONY AND IAN!!!
Captain Marvel was a man in the DCU not the MCU, she's a girl in the MCU, man in DCU
THAT LAST BTS SCENE WITH THANOS IS SO FUNNY
The reason captain marvel was originally a man in the comics is because DC's shazam was captain marvel but MARVEL trade marked the name
i gonna take my antman to the thanos HOLE
<3 idk what to say but Hi
Who just wants the no budget old smosh back
Captain marvel the genderbent version is actually Captain Mar-Vel
Another video that proofs If Marvel Characters we're real better than Every Blank Ever
Wolverine got his horses in the back.

I didn't KNOW that about Captain Marvel different origin 
Mind Blown!
Only 90s kids remember Stevie.

Not the same without Anthony.
Yah still exist
WHERE TF IS IRON MAN?
I want the original smosh back.
I think Courtney could be a better Captain Marvel than Brie
I miss Anthony
It's weird to think Damien wasn't on the Smosh channel before. He's so much better at doing skits than everyone else.
Marvel comic fan is the new villain
This made the fans seem sexist towards captain marvel when it's Brie Larson who's the sexist one
Who remembers charlie the drunk guinea  pig
I hate shazam I like captain marvel better
Ahh an auctuall funny video from smosh

Captain Marvel is the only person that can defeat them out in the Marvel universe thanos

Dc:Shazam/captain marvel 
Mcu:captain marvel
People are complaining about Anthony gone but Stevie really died
If he was a man in the comics
Smosh are back
MY NAME IS CAPTAIN MARVEL AND MY SUPERPOWER IS TO BELEIVE IN MYSELF!
Spider-Man: "I also work part-time, building sand castles."
2:37 that oh.... sh*t... was awesome
Captain marvel should be a man facts not affend falemale
People really think this is funny?
No one’s gonna talked about Professor X?

Okay then.
I miss the old smosh
Back to the crude Smosh jokes. Kinda like it!
I need more thanos
Please do a totally true documentary about the waiter from every first date ever
Like if u agree
Ian: thanos is more bigger than that human sized whimp thanos gets punched by captain marvel
You should do a every every blank ever ever
I had a dream about this video
You guys should make a every game show ever
But they are real, we just survived the snap
this video is really funny
Whoever designed Thanos needs erase
You guys should make a "Every Smosh Video 2 Ever"..

Make it where you guys redo some of your favorite videos and convince anthony to do a scene with Ian where they announce anthony was leaving but then it shows all our comments and things are going through Anthonys mind and saying hes not coming back and you all just randomly do random stuff or have a big group hug
And if you see this.. Please announce it in the start of a vid
Strange dubbing in Spanish I like a lot
What people wants:
1. Ian and Anthony
2. Stevie
3. Ian's mom
4. Random Girls
5. No one else just Ian, anthony, stevie, ian's mom and random girls.
shane as cap lmao
1:25 lmao the way Shayne runs away
Marvel characters are real in their own realm of reality, aka the MCU Ect ect
👀Finally, a “ Thanos “ related vid👏🏼








Btw Courtney’s stunning like always❗️♥️
Courtney looks like scarlett johanson
I miss the old smosh
This is 💩
I miss the old sound when you see the name title
Roses are red, 
Violets are blue,
Everyone who disliked this,
Should live in a zoo
comment to sign the petition to bring back. ANTHONY and the shut up intro.
Dr. Strange part
I thought thanos was a grape but he looks like a unemployed phsicic
Can you please ask Anthony if he can join back to smosh I loved him
who else misses the old smosh
Thanos would just be a big muscular smart guy
IAN AND ANTHONY
lol why is damien using Banes voice for thanos
How is there 4 dislikes who dislikes smosh should be no one!
its 4:20
Aren't half of them just dust at the moment?
So we're just going to ignore that not only is Carol danvers the seventh captain marvel, but also the least favorite? We're going to stick to the "because she's a woman" argument even though most complaints deadly with how unnecessary she is and how overhyped she is and how two other, more popular, versions of the mantle were downplayed to boost her up?
Bro what. Your Captain Marvel joke doesn’t even work.
Actually shazam was the original captain stoopid
00:20 Ant Man joins the chat.
Eye bruh profen
She looks better than the actual Captin Marvel  <3
I wish anthoney to b back
I miss Anthony  just click this if you miss him to
 
👇🏼 cause I do 😕
Courtney should have been captain marvel it she looks a lot like captain marvel
How did you get those powers? I want them!
To be fair... nobody, really cares about old Thor.
Anyone else wonder if Courtney really wants to do that stuff to Ian? Lol
But uh uh I’ll head to class Try my best on every test till I pass and my grades are screaming in my face ay 98 percent of what you learn is a waste

Every Easter ever
It would be cool if you guys recreated your first videos
Anthony is too super hot
What if adults grew up?
2:35 why horses?
If anthony was still here this channel wouldnt be as boring
Props to Damien he did the best British accent from an American I’ve heard from.





Well I do one better..
Bring back Food battle food Battle 2019
Why did the company buy Smosh?!
1:21 Oxycontin is such a bad but fun drug
Tinder for hot dogs
poor keth
Sick
I like that they chose the woman captain marvel first only because she is currently the most popular version (as I have observed at my local comic book store) but I do think that doctor Mar Vel should have been a man just to be a tad closer to the comics. I do like how they had Monica rambeu as a character tho. She was so adorable. Plus it leaves the story arc of her taking the mantle open in case it goes in that direction for the cinematic universe.
If only they knew that the infinity gauntlet does not always kill half the universe
Where is ian and anthony?
On the show /w no name u should get people to put what country they’re from when they send fan art......I think it would be cool to see where your fans r from
Who said they are not
To think of it we haven’t seen Stevie in like a few years?
I worship thanos
I got an infinity war ad wth
I miss the old Smosh.
You do know that Professor X can't properly read Wolverine's mind right.
That NASA shirt...
Every mukbang ever
Make another food battle
Kourtney looks like that one soccer skin in Fortnite
🖕🏾🖕🏾nasa shirt guy
Where is Ian and anthony
why ElSmosh don't back????
The gems from the gauntlet is not in outer
They're back
Captain marvel was A GUY and DC AND SHAZAM FRIEND in the comic 😎
Courtney is more captain marvel than the captain marvel
2:17 I like this one
where's captain sparkle fingers? oh wait wrong universe
get Anthony back
Shayne looks better than Chris Evans 🤩🤩🙏🙏🙏
0:51 died, got replaced moving on!
Yeah lets make fun of all the guys that were butthurt they used the Carol Captain Marvel but not mention the fact that they gender swapped the original Marvel in the movie thats totally okay.
Did you know you can’t breathe while smiling?




Just kidding, I just wanted you to smile 😊
But you see marvel characters aren't real.
Actually the male character isn’t captain Marvel it’s pronounced differently and their entirely different characters as well as mrs.Marvel and captain Marvel
I've been watching Smosh for 10 years now! Who else has been watching them forever?!?! Once my channnel grows bigger,  I'd love to make videos with them!! 🔥
Smosh became so boring after Anthony went
Why does Olivia kind of look like Karen from the office in the thanos scene
Actually captain marvel was a girl and captain mar-vell was a boy. (No hate, I'm just a nerd.)
hey dude what happen to your mom is she ok
Smosh is running out of ideas 😞
Captain marvel in the comics was a men then a girl got his powers
If thanks can click with his pointing finger is he god?
You try clicking with pointing finger
AUNT MAY
My mom thinks that Captain America and Captain Marvel is the same person
If u miss him go to his channel
Captain marvel is a man in the comments my grandad is furious he asked me if she is transgender and why all of sudden she’s is female lol  I still love him though
Shazam
I want to be a marvel character lmao
Thanos tryna smash lol
Horse po.rn lol?
I really wish you guys would play card games again that s*** was so funny to watch
:( smosh was better back in the old days
So Thanos is the voice behind the "Dear kitten" videos... That explains a lot.
What happened to Anthony
For all the small Youtuber who wants to help out each other. LETS help eaaach other
Yes captain marvel was a dude but the female captain marvel was miss marvel captain marvels apprentice then after the guy captain marvel died miss marvel became captain marvel so yeah
Let’s play a game





Boys are odd and girls keep even let’s see who wins 
👇🏻
How do they literally look like every single superhero lol
It Smosh gets rid of series they’ve made it would help the channel a lot.
Just asking what happened to Antony Padila??
Can you make an every KFC ever?
Hi






You're cursed now 
Like this comment to be not cursed 
" "
I regret watching that..
smosh is actually really boring now, especially without Anthony

Trending, baby!
I really miss old smosh  , who does too ?
Please do every Chuck E. Cheese ever
Why is smosh actually funny again?
Legit though, half of smosh IS DUST at this point.
Smosh is getting funny again wow.
Is it really just me?? Shayne really look like Chris Evans!!
Anthony Padilla Is a Hero
Literally nobody cares Captain Marvel's a woman, they just dislike Brie Larson.
Thanos is like the aliens from Twilight Zone “To serve man”
WHY DO THEY NOT DO SHUT UP ANYMORE 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭
Yo, I have an idea for a video: get Anthony back for a video and then keep him forever!
Captain Marvel = OP
Noah would be a perfect spiderman
Wait smosh till exist
This channel has gone down the drain
Sorry Rudy's version was better.
Now do DC characters
Courtney Miller looks way hotter as Captain Marvel than Brie Larson does
Nice on trending too
Ian and Anthony you used to be in erb in 2014
Smosh is not the same anymore
he is true in the comics thor does turn into thor odinson and has stormbreaker.
Hey I’ve had a  tough couple weeks because I was  assaulted and I have now lost have of my eyesight. Watching your guys vids made me laugh when I thought I couldn’t. I just wanted to say thank you

Um actually, Xavier can't read Wolverines mind. His adimantium skull shields him from mind reading.
Where is Shut Up intro
Guy wearing AC/DC shirt: “So you can read minds? Prove it...”
*Professor X thinks*
Professor X: “You’re a big fan of AC/DC...”
Guy: “Woah... how did you know....”
Every Mukbang Ever

Fake... captain marvel is talking to a white male
What has smosh come to
What was Noah doing when it was the doctor strange part
Fire Brie Larson and hire the girl in this
lol remember when smosh was good?
BRING BACK ANTHONY
I love the bit when they addressed Captain Marvel being a man, but Captain Marvel literally passed on his title to Carol. So in other words that is now her alias. And plus she is the only one people really see when you even look up a Captain Marvel comic.
2:37 haha I'm cracking up
Love smosh
Spider man tho 😂
thanos the purple grape
Captain marvel wasn’t originally a man she was always a girl mar vel  was a man
Thanos chin in this vid is just all kinds of wrong

Every pregnant woman ever
Whats with Anthony
XD the thanos though
what if my hero academia characters were real? 🤔
The captain marvel one is literally a huge "said no one ever" moment.
0:49 and nick fury was originally white
Thanos can actually control who he makes disappear so in this video thanos actually chose Keith and captain marvel was never a man
All of your viewers are bots and you get berly views
Lmao
Say hello to my little friend 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆

Toodles lol
Every thing ever this gets tired we need smoosh back with Anthony 🥺
But thanos is real
Monty python music in the transitions
Does anyone think they still have Charlie?

WYE Marvl!!!!😠😠😠😠ok
Captain Marvel was a man in DC comics, not in Marvel. Know the difference, dude.

re

Nice
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST CAPTAIN MARVAL BEING A WOMAN??? HUH?!!
Please make another Marvel parody!!! Ian is a perfect Ant-Man, Shane makes the perfect Captain America, Noah makes a perfect Spidey and Courtney did excellent in both female roles... Need more Marvel parodies from you guys!!!
Umm... what happens if Thanos listens to some nice music and unconsciously snaps to the rythm?
Can someone explain me where is Anthony
I have a 1978 iron man comic and ye he was a man
Smosh isn't funny anymore.
Actually captain marvel is a girl but the old marvel, the new marvels superior, was a guy not a woman
Xavier can't read Wolverine's mind tho.
yea
Ianprankprodiction
I found this when I search up the weird side of YouTube
Please stop being sexist Captain Marvel (I’m only saying she because well currently she is a female)
Instead of a nerd telling Captain Marvel about the original Captain Marvel, and how he was better than her 'because he was a man', you should have made him mention that the original Captain Marvel was a much better person than her. (Have you SEEN what she is like in the comics????) Then she would have called him a misogynistic, homophobic, white, straight male, THEN she would have blasted him. I miss the time when you guys were politically incorrect. ☹️
Ok
Nice
Eww not this trashy channel. lol never funny
Bruh sense when was captain Marvel a man?  Like 4 real nobody dislikes captain Marvel for being a women it's the fact that brie Larson is garbage and a pretty bad actor
ElSmosh is die :(
Thanos looks like a g r a p e
I came here for big chungus
Wha
Shane is a good fit for Captain America
What happend to anthony
What is with all the GAY jokes? Smosh is totally gay
Se extraña smosh en español...
Los extraño en español
That’s the point of the movies.
Weird
Hey how was the Mr. Beast's challenge of fortnight with jadenanimathan and theodd1sout
Like only if you remember smosh babies
No
Do people still think smosh is funny...
This shows just how stupid all Marvel movies are hahhaha
Why thanos look like a purple david chappelle
WtF
Doctor Strange is Noah? That’s strange. heehee
Is that the real Spidey
Smosh really died out
“What’s that?”
Ian guess what your now in a Disney movie
Hola
Whers my boi groot
Old Smosh Was Better
Barbeque Bois
Spidey senses lol
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
Isn’t there an entire movie series about what would happen if super heroes were real called like “Avengers” or smth? I’m not sure.......
Plot twist, when thanos snaps he dies
thanos died
Yo mamma so fat thanos had to snap twice
😂Lol lLol
I miss Anthony padilla bring hom back
Smosh should react to K-pop (preferably BTS) Like if you agree!👍
这些妹子还真是可爱
Jh4varc cht
Where’s lan
I dont like asian
Just write an entire series for Thanos played by Damien working as HR. Please.
I hate this new smosh character
Hi
What happend to old smosh
This was awful
Shazam is the REAL Captain Marvel
omg i love this
0:41 She looks better than brie Larson imop
captain marvel was originally a man but the real sin here is that you didn't point out that the mcu captain marvel should be called ms marvel because that's who she is supposed to beeeeeeeee
Damian was great as Thanos
This is the unfunniest thing I've seen in a long time.
He was also Thor odenson that's how Norse last names work
Make a whole show of just thanos at the office
i yawned atleast 50 times
If dc characters were real
Ewww Damien in a bald cap is so weird
Smosh needs to exist in the marvel universe
Does anyone still.miss anthony
Hey support pewdiepie to win aginst t series Pls
So fake, but so tru. 🐺
If my balls were made of steel…
I think Shane has a addiction.
You guys are actually freaks
This is just lame not even funny at all
Did Thanos lose weight?
Wait Proffeser x Is a Marvel Character Cause If It Is Oh.
I know it's been a year but bring back anthony
Hands down that horse joke of was brilliant 😂
"I want the big ones" 😁
Can u make if pokemon were real or every pokemon ever
I don’t want anything to go up against Anthony but I still miss him I wish he would come back. But bringing him in for a video would be cool.
You and Anthony should get back together
But what if at the time of the snap, the universe has an odd number of living things?
He looks like Paul Rod😂
Hate to be that person but captain marval was always a girl . But there was a dude captain marval in DC
If hero's were real wouldn't that make villains real too
..we,d all be fugged
Anthony is back
I <3 guys
wolverine is a marvel charachter?
Every Retail Job Ever
Technically captain marvel is Shazam but you know...
Go away “SMOSH”
Smosh just isn't the same without Anthony
If DC Heroes Were Real
Smosh is back?????
"I know, I style it that way"
Thank you for keeping Damien
Damien personality is HUGE is the best way possible lol
The nerdy guy Ian plays is so me
It’s MAR-VEL not MARVEL get it right smoosh
Man the consistency in this universe is just as messed up as in the movies. They straight up switched actors for professor X.
Courtney does look like captain marvel tho
Can you guys do a collaboration with coryxkenshin on a try not to laugh
No ant man meme?
that last part was silly
Uajajaja 😜🤣🤣
So why did they change captain marvel to women?
Thanos looks like a purple secret baldi harassment
Noah should've been captain America because in try not to laugh he was like "zip me up I heard Chris Evan's quit
Who else clicked on this right away to see if the shut up intro would be back?
Wait Marvel Characters aren’t real?!
Wait when did Thanos become a hero? 🤔
Wait... professorX isn’t marvel, it’s X-men? Wait I’m confused because Deadpool is marvel but I thought... can someone please help I’m so confused???
Shut up Matt Bradley
Smosh used to be better when Anthony was there it is so boring now
Captain marvel was just a bad  movie nothing against that she is a female but they made her with no flaws or character development
I love this one! 😂
Dc is BETTER than marvel
YES. Captian marvel was a man and i like that one better.
I love how they used the outside of the Mythical studio for the Doctor Strange scene
Damian is a great bald man
lol i remember watching smosh when i ws little, the zelda rap was my favorite
I have a cousin named Jason who loves marvel and Stan lee
Where is the "SHUT UP!!!" sound ?
If Deadpool cannot die then home come he died when thanos killed him when he snapped his fingers
WE WANT IAN AND ANTHONY VIDEOS ONLY THOSE ARE NOW BORING ian and anthony were funny but now its just bruh
If Filipino where in America
Tbh we would all die in 1 hour
I’m gonna cancel smosh
Hi bru
Doctor strange said that Thanos could only wield the power of the infinity stones while he clench his fist so how could he erase half the universe by snapping his fingers? Illuminati confirmed
That’s so funny
My spidey senses are tingling
Only liked because of the ant-man joke.

I just gotta say I love smosh so much but dr strange wouldn't be able to wright
Y "ElSmosh in Spanish?" :(
do DC superhero next!
we forget that thanos could easily use the reality stone to shrink himself and use ant-mans plan against him
Wow. That was awful. Lele Pons bad.
Didn’t even realize this was smosh till I saw the comments
Entertaining as always 😎👍
Every house ever
Okay.
Captain marvel should have been putting people in jail without trail
When Smosh runs out of ideas to the extent that they do something that they already did
Smosh is an awesome veteran
TI’m dusting away as I’m watching this
How come I didnt get notified stupid youtubbbe
1:27 shane's running is funny
😂😂😂😂
Can doctor strange make fake sick notes?
Thanos:exist
Half of the avengers:Ali-nevermind
To see bloopers and behind the scenes click on read more
Thanos snaps 2 times read more disappears
That is really cool 😎 first
When captain said that his body was sore I thought there were gonna use the time stone on him
Courtney is a better Captain Marvel than Brie Larson. Also, she should write some spicy fanfics of her as Captain Marvel with Starlord while baby Groot watches.
.....yeah Imma need a sequel
I dare you to wear that in the cinemas
Skipped to 2:19 because the only Marvel characters I like are the X-Men.
I wish that it was a every super hero ever
Can we get this video to one million dislikes
Anybody else see the insta post
I’m a fan love you
selfcuck man
Saw damian on insta and he was rlly funny
That professor X tho
Nice video
Thanos:”snaps” sees Stan die from the snap
Thanos:OH NO HIT THE REVERSE BUTTON OMG NO ITS BROKEN
Im gonna be honest here, I've been around smosh for a little while and the quality is going downhill and it seems as if they are running out of ideas. I know that with the shut-down of their parent company, their budget/resources have been cut but i think they should start making new series (series as in "if [blank] were real"), like this series but its been going on for about four years and its getting pretty stale. I just wish some new series would come out, or they could bring back some old ones like "The big what if." and im still wondering who picked up the donut in food battle. I really like smosh and miss the old days of when it was just Ian and Anthony tbh (and stevie too ig).
My friend-boy Angus would love this!
This isn’t funny.
oK YALL CAN MAKE FUN OF EVERYTHING B U T MY MCU





jk love you guys bUT STILL
CAN U PLZ DO EVERY STREAMER EVER
Damian's English accent tho 👌
Did not know I needed to see Courtney as Captain Marvel
Damien's Thanos makeup reminds me of his So Random days
All he needs is one glove like O.J
How does thanos snap with a metal gauntlet on
DC next!!!!
Do more day jobs please there so funny
If only it was just Ian and Anthony.
YES!!!!!!
What are you talking about they are real this is new information to me
Noah as spiderman was  perfect
Nice!

PETER AKIMOTO!!!!!
Can we get more of Thanos in an office environment

Professor x cancan’t read Wolverines of mined because his mind has been wiped so many times
THOR IS THE BET AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST!!!!!!XD
well....everyone will be safe
Who still knows Antony Padilla.
That was rough...
Damien was funny. The rest....
I’ve always wondered if the avengers asked doctor strange for prescriptions and stuff. Like Spider-Man just goes up to strange and says “yo I got a sore throat”
Can you make a If Disney Cartoon Show Were Real like everyone favorite Star Vs The Forces Of Evil?
ooh, sassy thanos
This is garbage
why isnt batmen in the vido? he is a superhereo so. Why cen he be in its?
But they're not real!. But if they were? But they're not real!. This is why our country is going to die. Wake up step up to the plate and do something with yourselves your lives in the loved ones around you. Cuz no magical character is going to come out of the blue and save our dumbasses.!
3:10 legend has it he never took his shirt off again
Shayne was literally shirtless for 23 hours WOW
Dear smosh, can you do a collab with Anthony Padilla every old smosh video ever?

People nowadays, So lazy.
Nice!
The "She hasn't posted in 3 days" minus the 911 call. describes a lot of panicky people.  There once was a youtuber who announced that she was taking off from youtube for who knows how long. I counted 200 viewers comments "Did she die? where can we send flowers?" within 2 months of her vid about it.  She came back one year later.
Song? 2:36
HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH VERY FUNNY, KEEP UP WITH THE GOOD CONTENT SMOSH

Smosh Fans From 2009 = I LOVE IAN AND ANTHONY!


Smosh Fans From 2019 = Where's ANTHONY!!?
You guys should do skipping school in 2009 vs 2019
A good april fools joke would be saying that anthony was coming back.
This channel doesn't seem the same without Ant.........





SHUT UP
I remember 2009...
I was 11y old, and was bullied. It got better tho!
Girl: Dad I’m being bullied on the internet 
Dad: By who?
Girl: Gordon Ramsay
2:27
Who plays Fortnite on mobile WITH THE PHONE OFF
Tfw putting bullying in the title might get you demonitized, so you put picked on instead
I only realised that one of the guys from smosh is in the tv show abouy the 1980 called the goldbergs
2009 WHAT A GOOD TIME TO GO OUTSIDE

2019 WELP TIME TO STREAM SNIPE ON FORTNITE
come backs in 1920 vs 2019


1920: cya loser


2019: No u
OK 2009 and 2019 should be switched caude 2009 was chill 2019 ITS A WAR
They should have used the shut up intro...

😢
Me:miss___ this kid is bullying me 
Teacher:I’ll talk to them don’t worry

Dad :ima beat there @$$ 
Mom:I expected that to happen
my favourite line in all of Smosh

‘give me your v-bucks beta’
“Gimme your v-bucks beta” 😂
3:38 so no one's gonna talk about the subtitles...?
They should’ve added the old smoosh intro for all the 2009 ones
2009 :give me your money 
2019:give me your vbuckss
1:21 funny how the video was paused but he was still talking, lol
keith : i just wanted to kiss noah

Me (aka British nerd): well for us British people fortnite means 2 weeks

People don't get bullied in 2019, it's all just a social experiment.
You should do a 13 stages of break up!!
If you don’t know or play fortnite  in my school your cool
remember when you were the most subscribed channel on youtube at 11mil
Kid From 2009 = Hi Guys! LET'S TRADE POKEMON ON THE DS!!

Kid From 2019 = HECK NAH! WE'LL JUST PLA SOME APEX LEGENDS AND FORTNITE!
The first 2009 one in my middle school is how it works now.
Oh damn, I clicked on it and didn't even realise it was a Smosh video.
I miss the "Shut up".
2009: Smosh had a soul
2019: corporate trash.
I can assure you that here in 2019 the teachers still don't care😂
First of all Fortnite was made in 2011 and Fortnite Battle Royal was released in 2017.
My favorite part is the sexuality one I feel happy that today they respect any kind of sexualities I'm Bisexual by the way
Footnote wasn't even out in 2009 it was out in2017
2:06 is the opposite at my school because the teachers think you fake getting bullied until you get proof but they said you’re not allowed to record the bullying so they just chuck you to the school councillor which does nothing
You're so gay in 2009 - Insult. 

You're so gay in 2019 - Compliment.
Kid: gets pushed and called names
Teacher: Nothing
Kid: packs 10 seconds early
Teacher: did you just pack up ten seconds early? How dare you Jimmy, you have lunch detention all week
Do Ditching School 2009 vs 2019!
Kid: Gets bullied
Teacher: Eh.
Kid: Wears hoodie
Teacher: TAKE IT OFF TAKE IT OFF!
Hey!

Me: OOF RIGHT IM THE PRIDE
Me: mom im getting bullied
3:37 
Keith: I just wanted to kiss Noah!
Me: 😐😶😯🤭








Great. Now I need to add another couple to my ship list
2008: teacher does not care
2019: get expelled for being bullied
Yo i heard of this guy called anthony he seems great
You are gay
Me: no you
Bullying in 2009 was:
“Your not coming to my birthday party”
Yeah dude I play fortnite bro dude bro😅
0:08
My older brother:
Me to him even though I’m bi and he’s straight:
Can u do middle school I'm being builled at school and I'm in middle School
0:38 

Me watching the video




Me hearing my name: 😲
I haven’t play halo in a fortnight yes it’s spelled fortnight not the game but fortnight


Me(nerd) : GUYS FORTNIGHT MEANS 14 DAYS (2 WEEKS) NO ONE PANIC
I have a teacher named Mr. Applebaum

Does nothing but read from the textbook
Fortnight : a 14 day or 2 week period of time
Honestly bullying was way worse in 2009, back when MW2 lobbies were a thing.
Bullied in 2019-
Kid being bullied: brings gun to school
Keith: I just wanted to kiss Noah

Me: o-
1:11 old Youtube, old Smosh logo, old Smosh videos. Ah the nostalgia

EDIT: OMG 750 likes in 6h, this must be a dream xD
But fortnight is a way to measure weeks. 🤔
Kid: stop bullying me help!!
Teacher: Stop screaming, your EXPELLED!😡
Pansexuality representation 🙂🙂
Fortnite?

Ha, betas

I play minecraft
I lost it when she said to give up the v-bucks
Bullying in 2009 for me:

*Gets pushed by brother*
Fortnite came out 3/4 of a year ago
Pls bring back Boxman🤧🤧
2009: *Brother*:Lil Bro, you’re getting bullied at school? (Brother beats up bully)

2019: *Brother*: Lil bro, you’re getting bullied at school? (Brother beats up Little brother)
This is Basically normal bully versus cyber bully
You guys should do every art class ever
Me:bro I’m being bullied at school :(
Brother:report them to the principal
Me: WTF DO SOMETHING FREAK
0:08 Omg... I had the exact same shirt in 2009. 😂
1:11 and 1:20-
The video paused look at the bottom.
In 2019, bullying has way more cursing then back then...... 

Besides teachers don’t even try to help
Normal person: what are you up to 

30 year-old virgin: pLaYiNg FoRtNiTe
2009: fortnite is save the world back then
jacob doesn’t know what fortnite is HAHA

Me: := breaks both phones zip it.
2009: Cyber Bullying is a problem
2019: Hold my beer!!!!
Wasn’t Fortnite made in 2011 and not 2009?
Don't be mean to someone and bully them but you can still be nice
1:26 
THE VID IS PAUSED!!! xDDDDDDDDDd
Bully in roblox right?
They should make a sketch about a teacher stopping a bully. Then the teacher gets fired because the bully and parents charge the teacher with assault or something like that...
Who caught the joke cuz I didn’t 
I think theirs a joke because it was uploaded April first
The title changed just after I discovered this vid wow
3:27
So basically what you're saying is that the 8-year-old down the street knows the size of your weiner?
The FBI should be knocking on your door any second now.
How do they know what bullyings like?
What happened to skits like with a actual story other than vs and every blank ever?
Teachers always say...

He’s not even playing Fortnite he’s just starring at a phone that’s off

I really hope to see Courtney and Shayne dating
I'm just saying,
If there were a couple of obscene drawings and messages on my desk,
I would draw a couple too.
Maybe a little doggy or something,
Why do they get all the fun.
The real person that’s being bullied is the locker
I think you should do parties in 1999 vs parties in 2019

Like if you agree and comment if you disagree

You guys should of made a "every april fools ever" good video anyways
Our life in the school
2009 anything's changed  oh c'mon
2019 anything's changed  oh c'mon
2059 anything's changed  oh c'mon
2099 our teacher it's a robot... finally something's changed
They changed the title of the video from bullying to being picked on😂😂😂
Weren´t you the guy on icarly?
I was already out of school before 2009 so I have no idea of the accuracy, but the video was fun.
I liked how Damien was in the video without being in the video.
Omg daddy Kieth is the best
yeah sorry, but 2019 isn't like that they still bully people for being gay even though there really isn't a just straight person
Damien Suckz

Option 1: Block the person. It works wonders.

Option 2: Turn off your device.

To be honest I prefer warp zone because there funny
its good to not know fortnite
Teachers seeing a student get bullied: Meh
Teachers seeing a student pack up before class ends: HEY! EXCUSE ME?! DETENTION!
I wish the old ian and Anthony would come back
I miss Anthony
Somebody phone that number and tell me what happens
Yo I play Pokemon.

 What's pokemon..    loser
Jacob: doesn’t know what fortnite is
Courtney:give me your VBUCKS
fortnite wasn't made until 2011 and it got popular in 2018
2:27

Ok this is weird. This is literally what happened to me in school. People were talking about fortnite and I was like “oh cool what are you guys playing” and they said “Fortnite” and I was like “What is fortnite?” And they laughed too. That is really weird
I feel bad 😔 for Jake
PUT THE V-BUCKS IN THE BAG
Halo is soooo much better lol

I want to be on 2009 but i wasnt in high school ;(
2:41 TURN ON THE FRIGGIN PHONE
1920 year was the best...


Seriously look at cars, lady's, men's, architecture, literally everything... 
The era of style and elegance...
Biggest insult to give in 2019 : In a day you won’t read 40, or 30 but only 20 articles analyzing our current political landscape!
Cortney hey gimme your vbucks

2:30 Only Bots Play Fortnite On Mobile
1919 vs 2019

Its probably best that Jakob doesn’t know what fortnite is... its for the best
Except there probably getting bullied playing fortnite lol
“Playing Fortnite” (has a black screen and Fortnites not even on the screen)
Those students must really like bullying at those lockers
Somsh make a detective Pikachu vs Mr mime parody ?
2:27 Me in a nutshell
Damn my name is damien
He got bullied two time lol look at his locker.
The 1st one is soooo real in my school
Do an EVERY HOLLISTER EVER please. I think it would be funny, so please take my idea into consideration. Thank you

2:turn on your phones
Quiero que vuelva el Smosh!!!😭😭😭
Dang it I thought they make April fool's day video





So sad 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Yup, it's as bad as I expected
I feel like the one skit with Vince and the teacher intervention is the reverse. The one where the teacher overreacts should be 2009, whereas when the teacher says nothing it should be 2019.
I beat the shit out of the guy in the beggining i met him @ the gym we had a mutual combat agreement to Box and I Won by TKO its on the Internet. Im Uploading even more footage of It
1:29 the videos paused how is it playing
I want more Human Pokémon battles!
I don't think anyone normal talks about V-bucks or plays Fortnite in the Year 2019
3:03 this still astounds me
Man I love getting bullied in 2019
Smosh has missed the April 1st trend. I will forgive them (this year)
Also your a loser if you play fortnite
I love you guys!❤ you always make me laugh even when im  sad❤ (sorry for bad spelling im from Sweden... if that is an good enough answer/exuce)😂

As a Domino's manager of 2 years, I confirm this is exactly what it's like
Me: Can I have extra cheese 
Dominos: Absolutely not
Pizza Hut: Do You Want Cheese 
Me: WTF
2:00 Minecraft after Fortnite/Apex/PUBG
0:00 “No, you’re my favorite pizza place.” LMAO

My mom watched the Papa John's part and she screamed, "I KNEW IT!"
“Congratulations dude”
Courtney killer me😂
Hey Smosh, you’re my favorite pizza place!
My dad is the general manager of a Dominoes, so this was hilarious
"Bust down thotiana". Probably my favorite part of the vid😂
The greatest thing ever a dominos video with a add by Burger King
"You're my favorite pizza place" made a comeback
“I wish I knew how to quit you...”

Far too accurate portrayal of my relationship with Domino’s.
Shayne should have been an customer and say "Hello is this dominos?"
"Yes. "
Shayne would have said "You're my favorite pizza place! :D"
Og fans will remember how crappy their pizza was before their recipe change.
“Bust down Thotiana”

Shayne Topp 2019
Wait why is Shane calling other pizza places in dominos.*Boss walks out* “You traitor.”
I saw the thumbnail and immediately shouted you’re my favorite pizza place
Shayne:*on the phone*
Shayne also:DOMINOS YOUR MY FAVOOORITE PIZZA PLAACEEE!!!
Cop:here’s your pizza
People:finally it’s here
Cop:your welcome 
People: ummmm you got some pizza sauce on you
Cop:No that’s human sauce 
People:OOOMMMGGG
When i saw the thumbnail i was like “UR MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACEE
I've worked at a Domino's before and this hurts me inside
Can u guys do a every Wendy’s ever cause it’s my favourite!? Like if u agree
The part with the dominoes tracker had me laughing so hard🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love "No you're my favorite pizza place.. bye sexy." This is a great time to reference that joke 😂
THAT GODDAMN INTRO: “no you’re my favorite pizza place.. bye sexy..” LMFAOOOOO
No your my favorite pizza place~~~ok bye sexy... XD
Shane with lipstick will always be hotter than me
And that's  a fact
"no you're my favorite pizza place, bye sexy"
That bit with Shayne and Ian was gold.
My mom works at dominoes and honestly

Ok I actually like dominos

I got a papa johns ad before this
4:27
What's wrong with Deepak Chopra?🤣🤣🤣
Shane (seductively): No you're my favorite pizza place, bye sexy

Smosh: Every Dominos Ever

Dominos is the best in Australia and Pizza Hut is the shit place lol
i think pizza hut and dominoes are having a pizza war right now
As someone who works at Dominos I can tell you this is 1000% accurate - except (in the U.K. anyway) we do have stuffed crust

2010 - 2013 GOLDEN YEARS
Why was 6 afraid of 7?




Because 7 was a serial killer. 6 was thought 7 was acting suspicious since day 1. 7`s parents were 8 and 9. 6 never got a dad having 7 his only parent.
 and 18 was murdered by 7. 17 is part of 7`s crew. 17 hanged out with 7 and 6. Six gave birth to five. 7 and 17 nuked 8 and 9. 7 was shot and killed by 10. Leaving 17 alone. 17 had to execute 5 and 6. 17 went to court for  TWO years. Finaly 17 was sentenced 63 years for murder. 6 is still scared of 7 to this day..

Is it back.....are we returning to the Smosh Golden Era?
That first scene basically sums about Riverdale as a whole.
Ian's Pitbull bit is one of the best things you guys have done in a long time.
"Failures don't matter to me, and of course, success don't either"
my life in a nutshell
Adults Bop:

Yankee Doodle Went to town
Riding on his Mother
Every time he hit a bump
He had another Brother
Genuine classic Smosh, its been a while, but welcome back!
producer says to Damien: "imagine those rocks as cats."
Smosh ran of ideas btw what happened to the hot one
Ian is slowly becoming Michael from Vsause
“I don’t care when they say what happened to the hot one”
ian really ripping us a new one
👏 smosh has outdone itself this time good job guys
Rocks. You can’t have just one    -Damien Haas 2019

I Need To Go To Pitbull Grill’s Pit…
I love that Damien is slowly becoming another squad member
Me: smosh isn't funny without anthony.
Smosh: are you sure about that?
You should do a collab with Anthony Padilla
6 commercials that keep me up a night

Any good smosh fans? no? ok
When Samanda(Courtney) told Clint(Shayne) that she was pregnant I felt the emotions.
Gotta love Damian and his rocks❤️
thanks smosh 

i will now get no sleep for the next three days
Please bring back “The Damien and Shayne show” with the original format!
If VARSITY HIGH was a real TV show with Smosh in it I would totally watch it
I want a whole livestream of Damien playing with rocks
I LOVER Courtney ! She is really beautiful and cute... wish I was her bf !
Man, I missed the Shut up 🤐 intro from Smosh.
0:51 " What happened to the hot one" LMAO.
1:46 Wtf moment of the vid but still LMAO'D.
Who was here before the thumbnail and the title change?
YouTube did not give me notifications so I searched up smosh


YOUTUBE REALLY
Mythical.. YES!
YES!! YES!!
This video is good as hell,  thank you for bringing a cool video in years
Hey smosh,  can u make 1 vid at least with Anthony,  I kinda miss him ian
Me in 2018: Smosh will never be the same




Smosh: 
Wow first time I saw smosh actually post in 2019




Edit:nvm
adult bop is now a thing 







jk
Producer: Damien, pretend those rocks are your geese.

Damien: Got it. 

Also Damien: 

Also Damien: 
0:55 hot one =Antony .cool Easter egg
Now THIS is the smosh content i signed up for!
Nobody: 
Shayne Topp: i HaVe ThReE sYmMeTriCaL tEsTiClEs
You outdone yourself , great job :D
I'm going to Pit Bull's grill pit. Anybody want something?
Pvideo idea: DAMIEN PLAYING WITH ROCKS AND PAINTING THEM FOR 10 MINUTES STRAIGHT😂
Omg it has 666k veiws WE NEED SOME JESUS
Is it me or have I heard the word Xanax before.
I didn’t know you can become Vulcan from taking Xanax
“What happened to the hot one”


Damn still everyone miss Anthony
So was this just them doing everything they couldn’t lol. Loved it though.
Who else realized the reference to phineas and ferb's "brick" commercial xD
Thanks Rhett and Link.
The way she says father is phenomenal
Damien is slowing becoming apart of Smosh
6 commercials that keep me up at night
Also. The pitbull part was hilarious. Should be it's own sketch
Not what I was expecting but I'm in love with the new content that feels less cheesy and more creative!
Wow you got pit bull that fake commercial wow I'm impressed
This..............is actually good








SMOSH IS BACK GUYS
The Pitbull segment was brilliant.
"What happened to the hot one"


OH MY GOD IM SCREAMING LMAO
I like how Damien's rock part was just 12 seconds of a 4 minute and 25 long video but around 70% of the comments are about Damien with his rocks and I'm not even complaining 😂
I can't tell which is better:

Damien playing with rocks
Ian as Pitbull saying "Pit" as if his life depended on it
or
Using Shayne's dumbass tweet as insensitive content

Either way, this video is great!
0:55 Was He Reffering To Anthony???
Also Press the like button it turns blue.
Noah did the hardest role in the video..
No but on a serious note where can I watch full episodes of VARSITY HIGH
Why does ian look good bald... I'm concerned
"Rocks, you can't have just one" I feel personally attacked right now 😂😂
ima buy myself some ROCKS
cuz you cant have just 1 :D
Rocks you can’t have just one 😆😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆🤣😂😅 I likes this one it so funny
Oh my God the Damien part was by far the best.
Lowkey the Pitbull rhymes were better than what most rappers are putting out now
All of these "they're coming back to the good old Smosh" comments really warm my heart. Also the sketch with Rocks is so cool. Keep doing these, I guess.
i love how many tries ian probably took to film that pitbull scene
Who else got a ad when pressing on this video?
"I don't care when somebody says Smosh ran out of ideas or what happen to the hot one."

Ian, you literally made me cry. I miss Anthony, the hot one.
The quality is getting better! I..LOVE IT!!!
0:53 "What happened to the hot one"

I think someone is missing Anthony UwU
This reminds me of so random...... THIS IS THE WORK OF SHAYNE AND DAMIEN!!!!
Bring back Anthony Padilla and then u will have a great squad🔥👍👍👍🔥🔥👍🔥👍🔥😇😇😇😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
Can Varsity High be a regular thing?  I need to know more about Clint and Samanda's relationship.
Rocks 
YOU CANT HAVE JUST ONE!!
Because of youtube this video has less views then others videos i think 🤔🤔
THE BURGERS ARE TRIANGLE
ROCKS
Because u can't just have one!
Gordon Freeman in the thumbnail xd
your gonna be a father

Thats just a thermometer
when people ask where is the hot one😂😂😂😂
omg the pitbull part😂😂😂
I love the part when Ian as Pitbull rapped as a tongue twister.
I need a video that is just Damien playing with rocks
We need more varsity high !!
Here's my ranking of these commercials:
1) Pitbull's Grill Pit (It's just so brilliantly absurd. It probably has the best final punchline out of any of these.) 9/10
2) Rocks (Damien making the most childish voice possible + playing with rocks + quirky editing = comedy gold) 9/10
3) Varsity High/Mike-in-the-bag 2 (I think it's a good callback. Plus, considering Varsity High is just an elaborate advertisement for this brand, that also elevates my appreciation for this bit.) 8/10
4) Xanax for Youtubers ("What Happened to the Hot One" It's also a meta bit that isn't inauthentic or stupid) 8/10
5) Mike-in-the-bag 1 (Noah's commitment as a "not living person" really helps sell this skit) 7/10
6) Adult Bop (I like the concept, it just kind of pales in comparison to the other ones when it comes to production) 6/10


Overall: 7.8/10 Keep up the good work guys.
"What happened to the hot one" fcking beautiful XD
This video is now property of Ernie gang
THE BURGERS...





ARE TRIANGLES!
Ian’s pit bull rap was the funniest thing!!! Actually made me laugh 🤣
1:24
Burgers for illuminati followers!
Okay but what REALLY happened to the hot one
You got a new subscribe
Damien’s bit was so stupid but I loved it 😂
This is the type of smosh content I subscribed to almost 6 years ago. I’m glad y’all are doing better and can express your creative muscles the way you want to. Keep up the good work!!!
Damien playing with rocks is also secretly every Geologist ever. <3
1:47 why did Damien agree to this lmao XD 😂😂😂
This was pretty funny. Bring the ''SHUT UP!'' intro back, and make more songs like you did before. AND BRING ANTHONY BACK TOO
0:04 HES IN tHE rIVER dALE FOOTbALl TEaM?!
That pitbull ball pit was quite impressive. Wonder how many takes that was for Ian :D
This video has pitbull and kidzbop but this isn't a collab with  jacksfilms...

my god, this video was dark
I lowkey want that Pit Bull one
Can you make a request to the other please

And so the fallen legends slowly crawl back up the mountain...
This videos name was changed
Respect +100
Not going to lie. 
I wish Adult Bop was readl
I can't decide whether Damien playing around in rocks was wholesome or weird, but regardless, it's probably the best thing I've seen all year! That video was wonderful, thanks guys xxx

Guys with these sketches it's time for Smosh Live two.

*geology enthusiast
1:25 we need it now
Ian leaves all those "new" Smosh, finds Anthony and starts the original Smosh again. Takes back the old crew as well (Neighbour, Stevee, Ian's Mom, Teleporting Fat Guy, etc)




..then I wake up... realise it was a dream...and go back to sleep
"I haven't felt emotion in years." 

Same.
pharmaceutical companies are watching this like «wait this is a great idea!»
Giving me that 'So Random!' Vibe
Food delivery gone wrong 1:15😂😂😂
Ian is becoming savage.
Somebody’s been watching inter dimensional cable
He said pit litterally more than 25 times (i counted)
I have never heard anyone say "pit" that many times...
You’re my favorite mike in a bag
What happened to the hot one 😄 most comments from 07-09 were just about Anthony being Hot. With the rare Ian is the hot one.
WhAt HaPpEnEd To AnThOnY tHe HoT oNe??
yall got flashbacks of Anthony ? 😭
“What happened to the hot one?” 😂
Wow loved Noah in this, his best work yet...
3:48 . The guy sounds exactly like the psycho from Run For The Cube.  Could it actually be him. Gasp!
Just pop a Xanax to go to sleep
Duh...
Running out of Ideas?
Just grab one out of the Idea Box
Ian you are great and wonderful keep it up!
Did anyone else get a creepy ad about math
What happened to the hot one?🤣🤣🤣

You’re looking at him

Your welcome Ian
I really need something stronger than XANAX after watching this !
I miss the 2013-2017 days of smosh
underrated smosh video tbh 😫
I didn't know Brad Pitt had 350 Youtube accounts. Go figure.
Where can I find this xanax for youtubers
The pitbull thing was my far the best thing ever
This feels like Interdimensional Cable...
This video has me laughing so much!!!🤣
The videos are getting a lot more creative and I love it! Keep up the great work!!😂
I thought it was xana from code lyoko 😂😂
I missed the Old Smosh :'l
I have a question

Did Ian sell his Impreza WRX?
That Brad Pitt had me rollin
:O smosh are back my idols!!!
Only 90s kids will remember the old thumbnail
2:02 john cena starts running
I guess what happens if Anthony see this
This is awesome!
Only 80's kids remember the old title of this video
"Or 'what happened to the hot one?'" 
I freaking choked 😂
Ian, you forgot to say Dolly. You would have to say dolly instead of the brand name, for fear of demonitization, and PG rating.



Dahling.
Smosh has really gone down the drain
This Reminds Me Of The Old Smosh!!!
litterally no joke i name everything samanda ily smosh you are the best
I LOVEEE SMOSHHH but like did olivia and noah disappear
Pitbul forgot the "Dale!"
Give us back Anthony
Idea: every ad ever
I miss the "Shut up!" intro
honestly i would love to see adult bop on spotify
True fans remember when the thumbnail said Xanax for youtubers
Best video. Glad to see something different and hilarious
“WAH-WAH” Mr. WorldWide
Yes, especially if they're clones of The Rock.
Bring back the old intro ☹️
This was actually really good! Make more videos like this!

I just watched this on April 29 after the new video, and in the first one I was expecting courtney to say, “Flexed”
alright ian, you got me xD take my like
That Brad Pitt bit had me rollin
Imagine if they bring anthony back with boxman 3.0
Great montage of sketches!
Interdimensional cable
Smosh is actually just "So Random!" Change my mind.

1:05 No thanks, I'm driving.
Rocks
One was hilarious
Hilarious! Adult Bops XD
this video is criminally underrated
Keep up the good work you guys. I know that this sounds corny, but I truly mean it. You guys put in a lot of passion into your work. So, no matter what happens or where you go, you’ll still be doing a good job. 

Thank you, Smosh.
Somebody do a remix of this part 2:00
that's el Segundo high school in the first part of the video lmao
Best video ever since the shitty era of Smosh
Your Sketches look like they could be on SNL (1975-...)
I think Damien might have a thing, for rocks
Amazing video <3
Everything was a lot better when Anthony was around
Are the burgers triangles cuz they're illuminati?
Kidz bop is a classic. Idk about this adult bop haha
Mike in the bag
It’s actually half of a Wendy’s Burger
Good job guys! It feels nostalgic somehow :)
P E R T U R B A D O R
6 commercials that keep me up at night

This was the initial title
Is pitbull reference to smosh pit?
Noah had the hardest role in this.
I got The Amanda Show Vibes from this.😂😂😂
I jus realized there is no “SHUT UP” thing
He's in Goldberg
Did damien join smosh now? Ive missed a lot of things
When you will upload vídeos in spanish
Wow a special guest appearance by Briana Boho... lol.😆
THE ORGINAL SMOSH MAN :0000
The Xanax for YouTubers was the most "oof".
THIS IS GOOD
I died on that pitbull bit🤣😂🤣😂
Smosh ran out of ideas!!!

What happened to the hot one?!!!

i MiSs teh OLd sMosH wIt iaN anD aNthOny!!!

Ian : 
This video was so damn good. Straight to favorite
Wow this is surprisingly similar to old Smosh format. Like 2012 sort of stuff.
Do every kidzbop ever
What happened to the hot one LOL 😂
I smell quality content
This is actually properly good stuff
GET UOT OF MY STORE!😉😉
Why was the rocks one my favourite lmao
this is awesome.
The "Rocks" are Rocking the Street
You can't have just one
3:40
that sounded like his apology in Youtube Detention 😆
The title changed..
Ian, you've always been the hott one.
When your varsity woke high
Did anybody else get the tuber simulater ad and watch the whole thing
I still miss the SHUT UP! Intro :(
1:58 thank me later
I want some beef n go
YET ANOTHER GREAT VIDEO!!  I loved the meat termometer part, thank you for keeping making videos even though it is 2019 and any other youtuber sucks
Where can I watch varsity high
Man, first time i'm this early! :)
Oh HELL YEAH
We love you smosh 😁😃
Wheres the original Smosh intro? :(
I’d buy a whole Adults Bop album.
Ian doesn’t look better bald..




But he does look smarter 🧐
Rocks are harmful
This feels like it’s just a “So Random!” Episode
"What happened to the hot one"
Cough*Anthony Cough*Padilla
Don’t worry I’m here ( ;
I’d like some Xanax for youtubers for my outsides too please
The whole "smosh ran outta ideas" bit was M E T A and hilarious.
Why is the "xanax for youtubers" pack written in Romanian?  like daca esti roman :)
AYE YALL ITS PITBULL SKRRRTTT
I loved this video, lmfao
made my day xD
I wish they brought food battle back and had Anthony back as well
what did happen to the hot one?
Damien is such a goofball I love him so much!🤣😋

Every
  Ever
    Ever
I HAVE A PIT BULL!! I'm on my way
BALLS! You cant just have one.
Flextape keeps me up at night
We need Anthony back
I like his beard
Pro tip-If you try to talk to a girl and she responds with ,”I have a boyfriend “
Just say -“Me 2” and watch their reaction
We just learned that "the pitbull has the distinction or characteristic that, when they grab on, they don't let go. "
 You psychopath
Isent that a riverdale jacket 0:06
We need full episodes of Varsity High!!
You can only like if you remember this video was first called “8 commercials that keep me alive”.
I miss the character known as Ian mom
I love adult bop
I dont think I've ever seem something more beautiful
"You're pregnancy test, is really a meat thermometer!" 😂😂
Ian was always my favorite anyways
UR EHH GONNA H BE HA FATHHR HHH
Did you shave your sweet beard for this vid ? o:
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Well its funny to say that smosh is out of ideas, of all the youtubers i used to watch their content its still enjoyable and funny.  I like all those different characters they manage to make, and lots of them are so different like day and night .
Possibilities for smosh is endless, keep up with good work, don't sell out.
Wait so what did happen to the hot one??
NAME CHANGED!!!!!
I’m early! Keep up the good work Smosh!
Why does all of them sounds like vat19?
Is it just me or should Varsity high be an actual series
Fairy tales now vs then
Smanda is a lot like Samantha meh name
So it basically eats your frontal lobe out.




I’m down

"The hot one" lmao
I was scrolling through my home page and then I saw this video and wondered how I hadn't seen it before, but then I saw when it was uploaded 😂
This channel has really gone downhill.
“Or what happened to the hot one” Ian nooo😭😂

So anybody notice he changed the title?
real humans only know this video had 2 titles
Ians pitbull part was funny
This is great but a show like part-timers should be done again...
What even is this? I love it.
Things are finally getting back on track.

"Or what happened to the hot one" frick dats anthony xD I love how ian is coming back at the haters like "fck yall, we can't do anything about it. And you don't have a fricking clue what's going on". 

Don't worry, I think of this as a new channel. Old smosh died years ago, deal with it ppl. Just think of this as the new smosh

Not all best things lasts. Example: pweds doesn't play amnesia anymore cus he's done
I miss the  shut up intro you used to have
Rocks! They'll never be the same after seeing this video! 😂😂😂 that was great though I love it

My God, you're so old Ian, give me back my 2013: _c, I want to play Minecraft on version 1.4.6 and watch SMOSH
The part when Ian talks about xan for youtubers reminded me of the old legendary smosh, and it made me sad to remember those days i was waiting for the new smosh vídeo.......it seems they are trying to make good content again
Wait, the title changed. Did Youtube do something?
The person with blond hair in smosh is in a show called THE GOLDBERGS

Who Wants To Go To Mike In The Bag?
What did happen to the hot one though?
Smosh didn't run out of ideas,huh
Smosh is doing great right now. But no offence, I really miss the old Smosh...
This video is sponsored by Rocks™!
SMOSH IS FUNNY AGAINNNNNN!!!!!
I hope I make it to varsity
I don't understand this video, I don't know why
Does anyone remember the douche board?

Why is it better old vids than this things?
When the Yankee Doodle thing came on, I was like OH HECK YEAH MY JAM! (I memorized for a school thing) then they sing that and i'm like, "WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT SONG?!"
World wide
Smosh isn’t the same without Anthony
mike _ in _the_bag
The acting on the blonde girl is on point
what happened to shut up!
Shayne is super hot
I would think this is real if it was on my tv
What happend to this channel
First video I liked in 2 years
unpopular opinion: Ian was always the hot one but no one realized because of the emo hair.
Why did they change the title ?
Smosh is not ringing out of ideas

Wheres the smosh intro????
90’s kids remember when the title was 6 commercials that keep me up at night
What happened to the hot one
Ian is the hot one wdym
tbh, can you just go back to how it originally was? like food fight? or anything else? dont get me wrong, your new vids are ok, but can we just watch how it used to be?
Smosh ran out of ideas.
Yeah what did happen to Ian's mom
Ok YouTube. I watched it. Stop recommending it. Please. I’m begging.
What happened to the hot one

Smosh has run out of ideas. What happened to the hot one?

Lmao
1:48
Glad to see smosh is going back to the roots!  Just stupid funny fun.
I only like Shane when he is on The Goldbergs
YouTube premium should make varsity high into a real thing. I’d buy YouTube premium for it.
Every airport every
Every air plane ever
If there is any ad YT should bad it’s those god awful tik-tok ads
Where's the hot one?
“While you eat that pit bull” wait this isn’t china
So much better
I hate commercials They ruin my Day watching this Video btw who got a ad I did on the worthless Mindful video app
What is the website for those rocks?
Adult bop
Looks like Smosh is going back to their roots.
You remember when smosh was the biggest channel on YouTube.... I miss those days(2011), those days when smosh did funny videos
Me siento en clase de inglés
Can my pitbull come to pitbulls grill pit
i have no idea what this video is about but i like it
Yeah were is the hot one?
Why did they changed the smosh logo from black and white instead of pink and white
The only time I actually care about commercials is when the video is funny bit about it

You guys Gotta make a smosh movie 2
Smosh
Pitbul real pit
You seriously couldn’t shave 5 second off
Make fun of triangle burgers, but I’m pretty someone out there is somehow going to make an empire off of that.
FINE if anthony isn’t coming back....ian should shave
?????
Wow
pretty sad that when they make some good ass sketches people don’t bother clicking the video, but when they post EBE videos (not to say that they’re bad because they’re not) they don’t get as much viewership
The first commercial is so true tho, they r running out of ideas, that’s coming from a long time fan
More
Why is the view count so low? This genuinely feels like old smosh and it was pretty funny
F***ing YouTube sucks banning the best commercials for the best products
eu aquaritis
Anyone else missing 2013/2014 smosh?
Lilpeep died from Xanax and he had a overdose and he was a legend he love family friends fans everybody
I would go to Pit Bull Grill Pit
Anthony is going to have to make an appearance as a background character in one of these clips. Just a background character on screen for a few seconds but doesn’t say anything. Just to drive people crazy.
1:15 booty
Where is eathan?
When will anthony come back?
Can you guys go back to normal smosh
Lol “what happen to the hot one”
TOBUSCUS

Courtneys makeup is a bit funky in this video especially at the beginning
when will Smosh Games start releasing new content again?? or did Mythical only pick up Smosh squad??
Rocks is my favorite XD

The beginning reminded me of riverdale
Make a collab for FOOOD WAAARSSS with anthony or make a video where you like go back in time then you see you and anthony doing 2015 food wars and try to do it again and.... You pick what happens
i like that pit bull guy
Bring back Anthony..

I can see these as a normal utube ads
“Samanda”

Defy was a huge mistake.
Seeing ian in that bald cap... reminds me of that old skit they did
Ian hasnt felt anything for years? Well, I now know commenting "bring back Anthony" is pointless.
Why is this so amazing

Don't worry u guys are still great!
💓Olivia
Damn they died hard
Can I get a mike in a bag?
Waaaiiit...so he has 3 testicles and not enough sperm count to make a single child?...
They should do a “Every Old Smosh Ever”
"I'm so buff I'm legally beyblade champion" found my senior year book quote
hey, how ‘bout “every entitled parent ever?”
Oh Shane tried to say the name of yu-gi-oh cards(Exodia) but instead said Exodus, a book of the bible 😂😂
Who even works out anymore
New years was like forever ago
I love these every ___ ever as much as the next guy but......
Bring back SHOW WITH NO NAME
"Im so ripped, I'm legally a bleyblade master"
Is by far my favorite line
He said he’s so buff he’s legally beyblade champion
4:19
4:22 finally a Yu-Gi-Oh! Reference.
We need an "Every BRUH Ever"! Shayne and Damien are so good at it 😂😂😂
What about "Every Asmr Ever"? 


Like if you want to see this!
Every video ever
Every iPhone ever
Every bank ever
Every kfc ever
Every death ever



Lol u really thought I have the patience to do that
I just realised that there’s about 6 days worth of content on this channel. 




See me in 6 days!
Why workout when you can watch videos about workouts instead
I keep getting boners during the workout lol
1:19 shut up is back🤣🤣
Great seeing more of Damien :D
'' I'm so buff, i'm legally beyblade champion.'' XD
I love how much more Damien is appearing in these sketches

They should really do a “Every Sitcom Ever”
1:17
The Shut Up intro is back..
This is how Olivia and Courtney got ultra thicc
Hahahahaha so relatable hahaha I want to die
Shayne and Damien basically being every gay porn intro ever
Imagine actually caring about your health, what kind of world would that be?
My parents and bought one of those personal workout machines and put it right in the middle of where I play my Xbox, they never finish building it so I just used it as a chair.
I'm sorry but we need more Damien content.
Do Every Every Blank Ever Ever
You guys are so amazing! I wish I can see you and meet you but I can't

No mention of feeling great until you decide to take a nap?
Is Damien in Smosh Pit now?
You guys should do 'EVERY PERFUME commercial EVER'.
2:50 Actual representation of Shane and Damien's relationship.
That Yu-Gi-Oh reference at the end XD
The last one was deadly accurate.








Also... IT'S EXODIA, NOT EXODUS, GET GOOD!!! XD
You guys should do a Every Chick-Fil-A Ever
i cant relate 

im too lazy to actually go to the gym
Shayne Topp is The only one with muscles
Actual footage of Shane and Damien when they were roommates except this time they aren’t playing Skyrim and destroying controllers out of rage
I just did 10 push ups and chose to take a rest for 2 hours by watching YouTube

Hey smosh I love your channel it’s the best I subbed and put on notifications your amazing

~Love you Smosh
Missed that ian performance!
You can only like this if this is relatable.
How the mighty have fallen!
I craved ice cream after watching him eat it 

ALSO IT IS COVERED IN CHOCOLATE !!!!
The first minute was cringe worthy but the rest had me suffocating to death by laughter 🤣🥴😧😫😱💀
This is my mood Every time I work out
9/10 Not enough Damien
When Ian plays a bro-character, I confuse him and Shane...
That was Hilarious...
Every individual got great punch lines but Courtney and Shane robbed the show

Keep it up guys👌👌👌
That was a good one hope you make more try not to laugh videos those are super funny
Zodiac master plus 2019 ad btw
I’m so buff I’m legally beyblade champion😂
Hey you should do every cafeteria ever 😐
Making this video was a workout
Do a every chef ever!
Damien has been adopted officially by the Squad
sHaYmIeN
and it’s not just me this time.
they basically asked for it
If ian followed the DAMN PLAN, he might have gotten skinny in his first class.
“I’m so ripped I’m a bay blade champion!”😂😂
And that’s why Im allways going to the gym alone 3:00 😂😂😂😂
As a yu-gi-oh player, I find it hilarious that Shayne tried to say "I'm all the cards of Exodia" which if you get into your hand, you win the duel, but instead said "I'm all the cards of exodus."
Dudes, y'all should do 
"Every Janice Ever"
Smosh you are running out of good video ideas
Y la vercion en español >:v
Que mierda paso con eso
Make an every tik tok ever like if you agree or comment
I'm a simple man, I see Damien, I click.

Dear super amazing person reading this, 
    I hope you have a super awesome day! If you don’t think you did, just remember that there's always something to be happy about. It’s the simplest things that can easily make us happy. Be friendly, nice and help each other out. If you are feeling sad or down , remember that there's always hope. Even if all the doors are closed there's still a window. You are awesome, and you are amazing. You are loved and someone cares about you. Be happy, laugh, smile! Suicide is NEVER the answer. Fact is I'm terrified by how easily someone could take their own life. Please stay, there's HOPE! You are smart, beautiful, handsome, wayyyy stronger than you think. Someone loves and cares about you. You're worth it, you're good enough, you're not a failure, you're not a piece of trash. Believe in yourself!!
   I know some people don't like this and will hate, but i just want more people to be happy and to spread more positive energy. I'm not doing this for myself, I just wanna spread the joy to everyone. Maybe I did make some grammar mistakes and spelled something wrong, but I’m just a kid. I’m writing this cuz i just wanna make everyone happy:)
I like you guys I like your channel but pls don’t swear

ii was focusing on the screen so much that when they said that they where dating i was like omg after i moved the mouse and i realized that it was fake.
They need Shayne and Courtney to do the "we're just friends" challenge
Wait are Shayne and Courtney ACTUALLY dating? 😄 I’ve been shopping it for SOOOOO long! 😂
noone realized that in the Laundry Scene Anthony's voice can be heard saying Help Me cool lil cameo Anth ;)
Like to bring back the Original Smosh intro
do the shut up intro
Omg the reality is...


Reality. God this is depressing.
Ian mom and Ian friend should come back. That is why I stop watching this lmao
Courtney and shayne actually need to date!!! They would be so good together
The dating part hit too close to home.

Oof ouchie my self esteem.
Courtney never fails to make it to the thumbnail 😂
Pls be actually dating
video is so funny and good :DDDD
Shayne and Courtney are so cute together😍🥰
3:32 ok.. I wasn't expecting that
SHAYNE I saw u in Henry Danger
2019 expectation being good helping the community 

2019 reality well time to sit on my couch and watch smosh
I AINT GIVING UP ON MY SHIP
PRETTY MUCH WHAT I ORDERED VS WHAT I GOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are they actually dating?
Expectation: Anthony's coming back.

Reality: Crappy videos.
Wow I'm so happy this style is back!
COURTNEY AND SHANE AHHHH
Who the actual f*ck actually expects that second scenario?
Who remember the shut up intro
Is Courtney and shayne actually dating,they look CUTE toegether
“Oohw my lil Coochie!” -Courtney to Shayne 2019
Um 
why is marie kondo
not speaking japanese
Best video in a long time. Good job Smosh :D
3:04 ummm why didn't Shane wear pants?
Time to think of a super clever comment 








First
Ian: ok again you can pick one skit and we will put it in
Shane: 1:27
I want Anthony back 😭
It’s already March and the only thing I’ve done in 2019 is watched this video...
I know this is probably going to get lost in the comments but all I want to say is have a nice day and a nice life :)
Courtney and Shawn is a good couple
@2:30 THE LEGENDARY SQUORSE IS SPOTTED IN THE BACKGROUND
My little shanky boy😂

Then my little coochie😂 they kill me
Oof 2:47 hit me hard
Especially shane xd
2:28 I thought this was actually true 

Until I saw the reality
THERE IS 666 VEIWS
2019 expectation:Anthony coming back
2019 reality:Ian’s bowl cut hair coming back
I believed it. They are cute tho
This vid is actually just bumming me out
Not a great video. You show the expection then you show the reality after the expection happened so the two clips dont show contrast between eachother.  A good example would be

 Expectation: a girl/boy saying/taking a selfie or pic to upload.

 Reality: the boy/girl doing cringey tik tok.
The first video in the new "format" :)
first 







to last
This is exactly why I didn’t expect much for this year 😂
Just me or is Noah getting swole
Anthony and lan are the best of teams
2:44 Same Bro!
That's me 😂 2:24
That second one was so me!😂
That end part was so sad but so relatable ♥️🔥
Thumbnail changed HMMMMM
i agree on shayne courtney best coulple
yo what is that song for 2019 expectation?
Bahahaha for the Shayne and Courtney shippers out there, the hot single coworker was actually Shayne ;)
Bring back Anthony 2019
Was Olivia speaking...Mandarin??
2:53 Wow, it's like he's speaking to my soul.
How did I know all the comments were going to be about Shane and Courtney's bit?
lmao
The thumbnail is already my expectation and reality
I live in milwaukee
Who was here before the thumbnail change?
MY SHIP NOOOO
I think they just called Noah the most gender flexible person in their staff.
Certainly didn’t expect that thumbnail change, but this is our reality. No, okay, yeah, bye
2:40 you know lets just hope they get married  cause it be awkward to see your ex everyday and be in the same room for 4 hours
Expectation : Ian and Anthony reunited.
Reality:  Expectation VS reality without Anthony...
The way the vibes of these new vids are different now reminds me of how Brooklyn Nine-Nine's vibes are different now on NBC and I love it!!
I really love the vids you guys make and your bloopers interactions lmao
Shain I did'nt know u were on sam and cat

Courtney and Shane got me for a second
3:00 my brother has those underwear from old navy!!!!
Does noone ship shane and courtney😡😡
3:08 Courtney is my mom and Shane is me that's when she wakes me up for school
I miss the shutup starter :(
3:02 is literally me with my friend I annoy them and then they get mad
You know but Tesla
I'm sorry but I can't pick a favorite moment, so I'll say that 0:00 to 5:08 is the best part!!
Smosh has gone down hill
Wow, smosh has really gone down hill
Can Shourtney become a thing already.  You guys called it out, now it needs to happen!
Who remember when smosh are a YouTube king
Are Courtney and Shane rly dating or was that just a bit?
1:06 couldn’t stop looking at Ian’s zipper
Can yall make more of every black ever
2018 expectation Vs reality

Who still misses the old Smosh pls like
Wait so are they hitting it with each other or not?
i thought they were going to show  how people were donating so much that it disrupted goodwill
2:55 AAAAAAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂😂😂😂 👌 SPOT ON 😂😂😂
Wait are they really dating???
I remember when u were #1
3:50 why is their monitors off
EL OW EL
OWO
Sex doll = James Charles..?
Wtf happened to this channel
stevie, anthony, ian's mum, and Charlie the guinea pig i think are the most wanted characters to come back.
Who remembers when smash was the number one Chanel but then the VEVOs came along then all hell went loose
Nice episode guys!!
What happened to the good old days of smosh
Yo, anyone else noticed Ians pants were unzipped when it was the skit of him and courtney?
why do i feel like they where joking the whole ethma thing with the shane and Courtney dating bit
I don't get the one at 1:24
i miss the old smosh
1:16 I had to play it back again because I wasn’t paying attention either hahaha

I still believe in Shartney
What if i dont
0:21 UGH, CONNOR, THAT'S SO DISGUSTING
2:52 same
I WANT BEHIND THE SCENES 😤
Smosh’s humor is just predictable, it’s kind of disappointing
When is smosh games gonna upload again
Oh the call out on the Shourtney part! I still think that they would work well as a couple but of course we only see a very small (and very edited) percentage of their relationship. I do hope they get together but I like how they acknowledged that they’re both not in a place to be in any type of relationship at this stage. They’ve both just gotten out of relationships recently and Courtney’s working through her sexuality. We’re just living vicariously through them. But I do think they have a great vibe together! LOVE YOU SHOURTNEY! 😍❤️
You guys match
Love you guys
Keith and Courtney Kourtney ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💘💘💘💘💘💗💗💖💖💖💕💖💘💝
A N T H O N Y C O M E H O M E

Pls help pewdiepie
I feel the same as Shane, I don't like myself enough to think that I will ever date anyone, plus when you have achieved wizard status and are on your way to sage level it makes it hard to date.
Where is Stevey?
Every singer ever

squorse

Hi
Boxman pizzzzzz
Bro the break up one hurt because I’m watching this the day my boyfriend broke up with me.

Boring..... BRING old IAn back or Anthony
The tesla is a self driving car that happens to be safer than driving normally.  So the first one didn't make sense.
Okay. It's been so long since I watched Smosh. I think the whole "if games were real and pokemon were real" were like the first videos I seen. Then food challenge and some others but that was a few years ago. What happened to this channel? Explain please😕. I'm so  confused.
lol is that Marie Kondo
This was really bad besides the part that was Courtney and Shane
First video i watched of smosh and definitely the last shit was so lame i didnt even finish it

2019 Expectation: brand new-ish phone
2019 Reality: i STILL have a nearly 4 year old phone..
2019 expectation: i dropped my external hard drive and i'm gonna keep it safe when it get fixed.
2019 reality: my external hard drive died and i lost my old memories from it.
For Fortnite players
2019 expectation: season 8 will have great skins especially tear 100.
2019 reality: tear 100 sucks, then you wished black heart would be tear 100 but sadly he’s not
Where’s Anthony???

Shayne's pants rolled up lolololllol
3:12 is this a reference to marie kondo

Yep
Shayne+Courtney=Shartney
The consumer metrics department hates you,.  You know this, right?
Why would a squirrel horse have wings?
Also, now I'm curious about Shayne and Corts actual relationship statuses. FEED ME GOSSIP
I still ship shartney, I can seem to let it go💙
Are they actually dating

I live right by Milwaukee
Every Verizon ever

Every rich person ever?
Who else watches this video with a blank stare?
Hiiii
Why are you making this video in march, how about you do this at the end of the year.
True
wait.. are Courtney and Shane actually dating?
Self driving cars do exist and have already killed m0therfUcKers on the roads. If you've ever worked with welding robots and such at real jobs, you'll know robots have malfunctions all the time.
Very cooool
Is Smosh subbed to Pewdiepie?
The new black logo sucks
"I can't get rid of all of the piles, I live in the piles"
That's, legit, me though 😂💜
I miss 2018 (┬＿┬)
My life is expedition vs reality but it's just all reality
Wow they changed the thumbnail
Nice hair Keith
Courtney x Shane!!!
I'm still a 2018 potato
Shayne and Courtney messed me tf up omg
Is that the office of Rhet and Link?
Smosh: Directly state that Shayne and Courtney aren't dating
The comments: lol I still ship Shayne and Courtney lol


Personally, I find it pretty annoying when even one person assumes I'm dating a friend of the opposite gender, but go off I guess
2:52 I... I feel attacked
Where are the others. Courtney isn't bad, but she is in every clip.
2:53 SAMMMEEEEEE
poor main
How can this be so funny and so sad at the same time :l
Thank you Shayne, very cool
how dare courtney and shane play with my emotions like that
I love this video 😃

1:13 this man sounds like Donald Trump, scary😱
You should do every bachelor/bachelorette ever next
is no one gonna talk about my guy Gus?
Imagine if smosh did a podcast. And it was called SmoshCast. Oh wait...

Edit: Wow I’ve never had so many likes...
I miss when it was just Anthony and Ian :( i used to watch them when i was 7 years old 😂
Their vids were so much better (my opinion)
0:34 im not suprised,every vid has that reaction
Damn podcasts are making a comeback from the blackberry days...
You should've gotten the Nerd Crew to make an appearance here.
4:43 Matt Rob and the Corinthian leather 😂😂😅😅😂😅

Edit: Nope there's not.
I really missed the shut up intro
Listen to Ryan Higa's Podcast then. He barely has any sponsors and ads in his podcasts
at 0:51 only true bros understand what they say
I like how all the podcasters headphones are Tascam TH-03s(05s?).
I legitimately read every procrastinator ever 😂😂

If you can dream it, you can do it. You will succeed greatly and reach all the goals you ever your mind to and accomplish everything you ever thought of. Life is too short to wait..... I do Youtube myself and I'm not asking you to do anything. but I would love to hit 5k by March! If you like funny content check me out!! MUCH LOVE❤️
Smosh Can you help pewdiepie from t gay.

Yayy!! Now let’s see “Every Conservative Ever”. Or have you already done that?

To me without Anthony The videos would get less popular. To me I like the original better
Hey everyone there is this great show called wakfu it's really really good all most made me cry.

Love that delivery
Now that you are owned by a different company and we stop the same “every blank ever” and “vs”
My two friends and I make "fake" podcasts in middle school during class...all the time XD. (We never get in trouble).
I love how almost every podcaster have that same "generic" look XD. So far only Ryan Higa(even his friends have that look) and Miniminter don't have that generic look.And also Logan Paul...
Which is why you should listen to the misfits podcast
Is this just an ad for the Smosh podcast
Nice hat Greg
No fresh memes Because 7 8 9 get it because 7 ate 9
People who do podcasts seem way too passionate about every little thing that sponsors them, seems a little forced.
We finally see a Smosh video shot in the Mythical office!

The Rooster teeth podcast is good
Every chuck e cheese ever.
I helped.
HELP PEWDIEPIE PLEASE!
Every hike ever🥺
Will it smosh? Lets talk about that
The origonal title:
The rumours were true...

This was changed because everyone thought Anthony was back.
I miss when it was only Anthony and Ian...

But Rhett & Link are amazing. They're absolutely amazing.
Oh thank god for Rhett and Link literally 2 OGs helping another OG
Anyone else miss Ian and Anthony doing Lunchtime with Smosh?
Thank you rhett and link for helping smosh!
Considering how great Anthony's own channel is, he should continue his channel while collaborating with Smosh! It would be great to see him back
Me: Wait.. Anthony’s coming back?!!

Rhett and link: Lets talk about that!
Plz make smosh animation and i miss anothony bring back anthony and i miss the shut up intro
Wait Rhett and Link bought Smosh? 😮 Wow that is awesome! 😎
This is why rhett and link are the absolute best.
"I ate my shirt"
-Shayne Topp 2019
Why everyone saying did you remember bla bla bla but you didnt mention FOOD BATTLE!
Smosh shouldn't be owned by anyone but smosh, they're one of the OG YouTube channels.
Even if anthony doesnt come back permanently, he should still return for a 2019/2020 food battle ressurection
THANK YOU RHET AND LINK AND THANK YOU SMOSH FOR NOT GIVING UP
So... is honest game trailers coming back too?
Shoutout to the caption author: "yeet"
😂😂
Bring Anthony back
“I didn’t have a job.” 😂
The minute you said Rhett and link a huge smile broke out in my face I’m so happy
How do I become a part of smash I absolutely love this 👌😁
Y’know... Ian and Anthony kinda reminded me about Rhet and Link.
Thank you Rhett and Link ❤❤❤
Maybe with Rhett and Link in the shadows your content will actually be semi watchable
We tried to purchase Smosh but they don’t deal in “we’ll get cha later” currency. 

Congrats y’all!!!
I’m just now seeing this...rhett and link are the ideal ppl to house this family!! <3
still missing the original duo instead of a group of random people
I find it extremely refreshing to see such positivity in a big announcement video. Best of success with Mythical.
Shane had the best reason for not having a shirt.
Yay Rhett and Link are the best for doing this, I love them!
that's it gmm is now at my top tier youtuber list
sadly anthony and ian are no bffs anymore 2019....
ian: we got a new home!
anthony: a other company bought smosh for cash
LOL
Rhett and link ARE amazing :)
i love rhett and link even more now!
Its a new smosh. 

No. It will never be the same smosh. 😭
One of the best channels on YouTube paired up with another one 🙌 amazing
Rhett and Link are the real MVPs, if anyone hasn't seen their videos I highly recommend them. Good Mythical Morning got me through Freshman year of high school like they're so funny and entertaining. I'm so glad they're the ones who bought Smosh, that's amazing! Congratulations <3
I want to see Courtney and Stevie in the same room
Hell YEAH! Rhett and Link saving the day!
WAIT RHETT AND LICK BOUGHT SMOSH?!? THIS IS AMAZING
I’m glad you guys are working out good and working with Rhett and Link.
Sells company for 0.00$
literally, the best channels are working together now. I love it
I like how it used to be like a fun duo rivalry between Ian & Anthony and Rhett & Link, and now Rhett and Link just bought smosh
I don't care just bring Padilla back your brother
make your way to 50m subs
Kinda sad that Anthony, the one who created smosh left because of a dumb company
So like... Can they curse again?
I remember when smosh was the most subscribed Chanel on YouTube the Chanel basicly died in 2017
I ate my shirt
-Shayne Topp 2019
A smaller channel just bought a channel with 10 more subs that's confusing but aight

YES! My 2 favorite channels have merged! Congrats on finding a home.
Everyone is NOT here
Smosh Ultimate
I love how Shayne just stands there saying 5 words the whole video
Never forget how Smosh was built around Ian and Anthony’s friendship 👊
Lol I can't be serious, so used too every something ever
I need food battle watching since 2011
Wait who are the new Guys
Judging by Damien's reaction, it's definitely safe to say that Shayne's shirtless body was unscripted...
Wait what where is anthony i..i miss him:(
I saw a glitch and it said we found a racist?
Bring back anthony ples but a whole new anthony
with ian as "not the ball haircut dude anymore" and with anthony as "the not emo haircut dude"
Noah face on the thumb nail
Eh everything is ok 

But El Smosh is coming back?!?
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK

Damn remember when it was just Ian and anthony 🤷🏽‍♂️
Good Smothical Morning!
That's the best place Smosh could have ended up🙏🏽🙏🏽💕💕
From 2 to 8 sometimes I wish I could go back in time just to relive prime smosh.
lol Keith has a Afro,I like it.
Ian is like Brendon Urie because he’s the only original member 😂
BRING BACK OLD INTRO
Me:so Anthony?
Rhett and link:yes
Me:really?!!!
R and l:no
Nobody:
GMM:hey lets buy smosh
Get Patrick Nelluam back to smosh in Spanish!!!
You could tell Shayne was thinking about that joke the whole time
Rhett and Link's parenting experience prepared them for becoming the parent for Smosh.
Thank you guys for making our days congratulations you great and lovely people

Smosh: well yes, but no
Please bring El Smosh Back, and call Patrick. Saludos desde Honduras.
WAIT.. I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THIS AND IM SO EXCITED AAAA
😍😍 smosh finally your back I swear to god you made my day
Omg!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍 I can't believe my 2 favourite youtube channels are working together now 🤩
So like.... there are two main questions 1. Can Anthony come back? 2. Can the "shut up" intro return?
"You guys are gunna be there every step of the way" I appreciate that you found a home but why does this have to feel so corporate.
I ate my shirt






I didn’t have a job 

Best quote ever
because Anthony is left 😵😵😖😱
Im tingling with excitement!
Rhett and link with smosh?
What else Will I ever ask for
This is the most ambitious crossover event since Infinity War
im CRYING ( i just saw this)
Omg i learned about this through rhett and link they are the best!
Be Your Mythical Best!!!
Everyone talking on how we need Anthony back are correct, but we're forgetting Ian's mom
Great to see you guys are still holding together!
Best of luck!
Why cant smosh work as their own entertainment company?
I remember when smosh was on good mythical morning and they jokingly referred to Rhett and link as the "less successful smosh" at the time. Damn how times have changed.
Damn I remember when it was just Ian and Anthony wow how things have changed
Seconds after Keith got shocked.
You lie!!!! The angels Rhett and Link?!?!?
Well one thing good came of this.. Ians hair looks way better now.
Anthony returning was the actual rumour :(
bro. Keith’s hair tho
Next mission
Bring back Anthony
Look at Keith 😂😂 THE TOP OF HIS HEAD!!!!😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
U guys should make every "every blank ever" ever
Omg rhett and link are heroes
Damn....They came a long way just from singing Power Rangers Theme song
Two of my FAVORITE channels are working TOGETHER!! This is AWESOME!!!
Yay I love this channel to much it shall never end ps plz Anthony come back
I can't believe that Rett and Link bought smosh. Yay
Who tf are these people 🤔
All I have to say is






Nice beard Ian I love it
2 dynamic duos GETTING TOGETHER! Rhett and Link and Ian and An- ... oh yeah
THANK YOU, I just want to thank Rhett and Link for buying your company, and I would also like to ask to plz keep smosh winter/summer games, I love watching them along with all the other content, maybe a smosh love again too, that would be amazing
Welcome to the Mythical family ❤
WOOHOO RHETT AND LINK
Will Anthony return
"I ate my shirt....I didn't have a job"
I love the look of Shayne in the corner he’s just like “im still here. Dont you worry about me”
Smosh is still here 




but were is anthony?
Honestly if this hasn't had happened I would've cried my whole life away.
keith what did you do with your hair man . I mean you do you but  ok
Make season 3 of partimers
when smosh games uploading a video
My heart stopped after I heard that GMM bought Smosh! I love you all!!!!!!!
"i ate my shirt"
the craziest thing about this whole sitch is that the smosh icon is now black
Smosh changed its color after 9 years?!
I always shipped gmm and smosh :,)
YESSSS THANK YOU RHETT & LINK!!! Welcome back properly Smosh!
Smosh will never be the same without Anthony 😔😢💔
YES SMOSH GAMES
maybe I'll also be able to buy Smosh one day...
Smosh Has Joined Rhett & Link
Just got my shirt today! So happy you found a home and are back! I watched Smosh just about every day from Defy’s end to now. I love you all and I’m glad “i helped.” 💜
Anybody else from 1000k?
Neither was I, I’m sorry
“We didn’t know if smash was gonna continue”. Guess Ian and Anthony running it by them selves was all a hoax
There is onlangs onze way somash is perfect, with Lan  and Anthony 💔
Shoutout to RHETT & LINK 
What about Shutup! Cartoons?
So... um... you said Smosh Games is coming back?

I really don’t like seeing ian without Anthony
the rumours are true...what Ian’s mum is coming back?
Shane: I didn't have a job

*Is the only one with the stable job on the Goldbergs*
I keep on encouraging me to build the channel, hopefully the more successful the channel, I'm from Indonesia
Ian is just Joseph seed from farcry
Please make Anthony come back since you guys can now do anything you want!

Aw I thought they were going to refer to the rumor that says they're all involved in a polygamous relationship that kills off a member every five years and replaces them with a more suitable mate
office tour Office Tour OFFICE TOUR
They had no idea what will happen in those days when the company that own Smosh went out of business...

Having a flashbacks of Smosh in 2005-2014 when it's just Anthony and Ian
Wait... this was not what I expected
Article 13:  i’m going to end this man whole Career

honestly, I've been here since it was just Ian and Anthony but the current smosh gang is pretty strong and has a great diverse personality

We’res anthony
I’m still sad that Anthony Padilla left Smosh
The guy with the jacket buttoned up all the way to his neck...
That's great news. Rhett and Link made the right decision.
Food Battle 2019?
0:23 "Anthony is coming back!!" Is where my brain went first, but R&L are cool too.
Mama Mia...




Here we go again...
Why do u always have to be bought out
Shut up I miss the intro
I haven’t seen that design in a long time
The next Smosh Summer Games teams should be Smosh Pit V.S. Smosh Games
Hell yeah.
Curious as to when smosh games comes back
Can you buy back Anthony?
Ah. I truly do miss the old days of Smosh. When it was ment to be fun and not a job.
I like how you have no chance of survival, if someone doesn't own you. Lol..
Miss old old Smosh
What about Joven and Wes??
Ay man, could’ve been worse. Could’ve been bought by sugar pine 7
Smosh is so much worse now
I prefer like it was back in 2013
Thats cool Rhett and Link are dope
GMM buys smosh just to delete it
Im gonna cry,im glad the smosh gang is back,wooo yeah baby!!
Can you guys try new content that isn't "Every __ Ever"
nice' honest game trailers is back
i dont care bout the rest
you guys should do a long teaser in the new series hinting at anthony returning
Who remembers Stevie from way back when it was just ian and Anthony
😭 you guys changed I want to go back back then it was so funny but now it's not
these people are kind of yellow, aren't they?
It might get as good as before...
"Let's talk about that"
Dear,
Ian Hecox
This isn’t the old smosh anymore I have missed the old smosh so much pls if there is 1.1111% of getting that back I hope I could get it back😢
keith has hair?
Who remembers when Smosh was on gmm
they never learn
1:11 Shane takes off his shirt 


DAMIEN'S HEAD SHAKE OF UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT AND APPROVAL IS AMAZING
Sell outs!
YAY!!!!   Now time to wait for Anthony to come back
They come across so incredible not genuine....
Even the scripted jokes and stuff... and the gestures...
It's like watching a commercial for a kid's tv show. Disney or something.
Even cliche lines like "you'll be with us every step of the way". That is a weird thing to say, in a genuine natural situation.

Rhett and Link should have bought this, under the condition that it's only Ian and Anthony, doing early-days dumb shit, purely for the sake of nostalgia for a certain group of people lol.
This whole team thing is so weird.
Interesting that they're still bought... so still no freedom like the superrr duper early days (although they did sell Smosh quite early).
I LOVE RHETT AND LINK.... BEST DAY EVER!!!!!
it still not the same without anthony
Wait... That is Ian?
Please bring food battle the game back to the App Store I miss it so much
Whaaat?! Is that Ian? I didn't recognise him. Time flies...
I want Smosh to do a weekly video that's similar to "whose line is it anyway" featuring Shayne and Damien... XD
I came back 8 years later just to see how the channel was doing...this is not Smosh..
Who is Ian Hecox?
I miss the 2010-16 smosh.
YAYYYYY SMOSH IS MYTHICAL
Crack the back of the neck and slurp up the spinal fluid.
I SAW YOU MADE A POWER RANGERS THEME 15 YEARS AGO!!!
I thought Anthony was coming back too
It's gone so far downhill it's ironically funny.
Shane is my spirit animal
Rhett and link are just great guys
It's been a year and a half since i last watched smosh and i was aware of the problem and also WHAT?! RHETT AND LINK?!
OKAY. COOL.WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE WARP ZONE
Yo I love the videos I have some merch I have watched almost every video on every channel
Forgot these guys were relevant still
When's the next vid
SMOSH BABIES
Omg no way!!!
Pls activate the Smosh spanieh channel
Subtítulos en español por favor.
But what happened to smosh games
Why does Keith with that hair look like the black female Ghostbuster 😂🤣😂
I think it is fantastic that reth and link are the one that bought smosh. Can't think of anybody better.

How did I get this many liked!
Thanks.
Is mari, Wes, Bose, joven coming back as well since the channels are back
Haven't watched Smosh in a while, Ian has really grown up 😢
It’s because you removed Anthony
They need to bring back food battle
Ian just get anthony back
They didn't make a thumbnail
WHAT REALLY? GMM BOUGT SMOSH
 I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS POSIBLE AHHHHHH SO EXITED
Major Flashbacks To 2015
Cool, but can we get Anthony back, that's what we really want
Smosh was good back in da day
Okay mythical entertainment is good
And él somsh smosh in spanish patrick an that
was it for $0.00?
So is... Anthony coming back to?
You are making the  same  mistake
Since no one is saying it, i will. I love Courtney's new hair.
Only with Antony you can be cool
No why did rhett and link buy them!!!
Can Rhett and Link buy Anthony back
My birthday,is March 6 hope you guys read this
yaaaaas finallly courtney got her hair dyed
ian should go on GMM (ik ian and anthony went on years ago)
They say the gonna post on all the channels but yet still no smosh games videos
Ahhhhhh Smosh and Rhett and Link are my favorite ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
Yay!! Sending all the love to Mythical entertainment. Thanks for helping my favorite channel!!! Love all you guys!
Edit: omg I got 300+ likes thank you
For a sec I thought is "the humor is true..." Lol
Anthony who? We want Ians mom to come back
EL SMOSH HYPE
Rhett and Link are truly LEGENDS
Happy you guys found a new home.
Im excited both my fav channels good mythical morning and smosh best kombo ever.
Now Anthony should join back
Where's Anthony and Stevie?
In the thumbnail ian looks like erbs walter white with hair.
We just want Anthony back
I can't believe that's is been four months
Anyone remember the skits from like 2011?
I just want the shut up intro to come back
Great now get Anthony back and pull the channel out of the nose dive it’s in
what about EL SMOSH ?  ? .-.
If smosh is with mythical,

ANTHONY CAN RETURN!!!😀😀😀
lol i was watching rhettandlink and then this. Nicely done.
Some people, thought that Anthony was coming back


But not us...






Not us.
Yesssss!
Welcome Back
Wait since clevver was in the same building did they go out of business too
It is Friday my dudes
Smosh died along time ago
When a smaller channel buys a bigger channel.
GMM is amazing.
When it said Rhett and link bought smosh I was jumping in joy :)
You know what would have benn awesome? If you let Anthony (and Ian) buy it back so it could be good again.
OMG THANKS RHETT AND LINK LOVE YOU GUYS LOTS!!!!!
bring back smosh 2nd chanel
Anthony!!!!!come back please!!!
Smosh and GMM? Name a more iconic duo 💜 does this mean they’ll be guests on each other’s channels, or the crew?
oh hell yeah
Is the guy with the glasses the owner of smosh?   He doesnt look to happy...🙁
"I ate my shirt", he said that so proudly
is Anthony coming back?
this video reminds me of the end of bird box
finally you guys have your own shit back so when is anthony comming back?
Omg I miss the shut up intro!!! Please bring it back and tell Anthony to come back
Ian you should really cut your beard
CANT BELIEVE IM GONNA BE CRYING ON A FUNNY CHANNEL 








RHETT AND LINK BESTTTT LOVE U
Should be called the smosh pit
Haven't watched Smosh since 2011. Who are those other tools. Wheres Anthony.
I'm glad u guys are back i love u guys so much, u guys are so funny, love u
1:13 watch Damian’s face
el smosh will takeover this channel im calling it
Sooooo.... Anthony isn't coming back right?
Does that mean the shut up intro will come back?
Im so happy
I came he because of GMM.  Woot!
YAYYYYYYYYYYYY
UwU
funny how reth and link bought an channel thats actually larger than theirs
Remember when Smosh was just a YouTube channel, now.......

It’s a company?
Oh dang rhett n link eh thems are good buddies thats a new hope
Please stop whining about Anthony pls it been 2 years Anthony is happy with his own channel. And Ian is happy as well 



IT’S TIME TO STOP
Why did Ian and Anthony sell smosh? SOS stupif
Ian owns smash !!!
Ian looks like Michael Scott and Andy Bernard’s love child. Has it really been that long?
I hope Rhett and link are in the summer and winter games if they have them
I helped to
Smosh is not good anymore because was it ean or something I forgot
My childhood was all about the real Smosh: Ian & Anthony. Me and my sis will patiently wait for the next upload then watch every new release for like the whole day. We're here ever since the newgrounds days. It's 2019 and it still feels weird seeing Smosh without Anthony.

Our hearts are still broken.
Ian looks like Heisenburgh
When u get bought out by someone with less subs than u. Lol
What happened to the super virgin squad?
Is ian still the owner though
didnt the Misfits start this trend of moving into houses
Bitchess somebody needs to own you in order to make a living.
This wouldn’t have happened if u didn’t sell from the start. Imagine if u didn’t. What could’ve been😭😭
The rumour come out
Its been more than a few years since ive clicked on a smosh video... this isnt smosh
Go Rhett and Link!
YES RHETORIC AND LINK AND SMOSH OMG
Rhett and Link are so wonderful
1:06 wtf was that Courtney

Do you still watch 6 11 of ridiculousness
Anthony should own smosh again
Wher did Anthony go
Does this mean Anthony can come back now?
So does that mean now that smosh cannot use swear words anymore?

Acá esperando que Elsmosh vuelva
2 most disheartening things that happened in YT history 
Anthony leaving Smosh
Sean leaving RHPC 
We don't talk about T-series 😥😥
Rhett & Link should start their own Youtube
I miss the old smosh with Anthony ... just the good old basic videos
Now get Anthony Back
Courtney dyed her hair?

And also did Keith get a perm?

Still love you! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can someone explain why they need a company run a YouTube channel
What happened to Anthony?
It would be cool if Anthony came back to do some bits and still maintain his independent channel. I think that it would definitely be very nostalgic and be strong for Smosh's Mythical debut.
please revive the channel in Spanish
Denle su trabajo devueta a Patrick
...random passerby just saying, oh wtf? really? bought out? damn.
I dont know how u can be happy without Anthony
Welcome to Mythical SMOSH!!!
where's Anthony!
What ever happened to smosh games?
THANK GOD. Mythical are heroes and I'm so glad Smosh AND SMOSH GAMES is coming back. You guys deserve all the success in the world and got dealt a real shit hand the past few months. Excited for what the future holds.

Aw of course R&L bought Smosh. They’re such nice people
I love Rhett and Link and I'm sure they'll be great, but any particular reason they didn't just decide to own Smosh themselves?

Since Smosh isn't owned by a big corporation I'm going to assume Anthony's coming back.
Food Battle 2019 with Anthony??
It's either new parent company or Anthony returning
This has been the most silent smosh video I have seen yet

The subtitles 😂
I'm hoping it's not Smosh being bought by a 'better' media company.
If youy didnt have subtitles on you're missing out

That Damn Neighbor is coming back?!
FOOD BATTLE!!!!
The shutup intro?
F O O D   B A T T L E
With Defy gone, there is no reason for Anthony to stay away. He hasn’t really exploded in terms of subs or views with his own channel and could still keep it.

It’s a podcast

Yes they bought it.

I don’t think Anthony is coming back since his content is VERY different now, I think someone bought smosh?
Time to make this a meme.

End of video

I love that this is on trending
It took decades for you to finally look normal.
Omg Anthony is coming back
Where's the video?
The return of Ian's Mom
I don't know why but now you kind of look like that police officer the "main" officer from stranger things
Watch the video in captian there's a secret if you do
It's gonna happen during school... Bad timing smosh...
I’m so happy you guys have found a new parent company 😊😊😊
I want Anthony back
Honestly if you turn the captions on they just say random stuff, but I think you might be able to translate it into something
He is talking about joyryde's new song
title of next video = the rumors are true.....WE FOUND A HOME!
No more ideas yes? LoL
Ian quit?????....
Smosh Movie 2?
Is Anthony coming back
In other news, Mark from Love Actually wants his cue card silent shtick back.
Er today is friday
Please be Anthony
Are they finally going to bring back honest game trailer?
Either they're getting bought by Rooster Teeth or it's literally just that the website is getting revamped.
Who made the captions of this video?
They’re finally going to end smosh :)
The return of Anthony ?
Wood paneling. Check.
Having a storyline with Sugar Pine 7. Check.
I smell some rooster teeth in the air
The donut sausage tho by they do is back
George Washington’s birthday is coming Friday! Why is nobody else excited?
I think rooster teeth is the new home of Smosh!!!
Feels bad for all the blind smosh fans :/
Food Battle?
Or...
ANTHONY'S RETURN?!
OMG
Edit: wow thanks for the likes
I thought today would be a nice relaxing birthday (I turned 18) and suddenly this happens

Edit: Wow, I did not expect this to get so many likes and comments. My comments never get noticed usually. Thank you!
Smosh the move 2?
I think Old Days of Smosh are returning.
Maybe it’s Smosh the movie 2 or another youtube red series! (Maybe this time the whole gang can join like Shayne and Keith etc.)

Or it’s just some new merch
Or an insanely overhyped video.
Comment what you think!
it better be somethign to do with promoting pewdiepie
it better be somethign to do with promoting pewdiepie
it better be somethign to do with promoting pewdiepie

It would be cool to have one more Food Battle, a grand finale.
Anthony rejoins and his career is saved

Plot Twsit, Ian is Anthony and Anthony is Ian, so we are waiting for Ian to come back
What time on friday
Nice captions
I wish it's Anthony
Ok I got it, Ian and Anthony was casted in the angry birds movie, since the sequel of the film trailer just came out today, that means that... Ian is in angry birds 2 idfk xd
You guys selling out again?
кто нибудь ещё помнит Энтони?
Are yall finally letting anthony back?!
check out the captions!!
Welp, now I’m really scared
Use substitutes for an enhanced experience.
Food battle 👀
Oh yea yea
Is it me or is Ian starting to look like Link from Good Mythical Morning?
Winter?
Its already friday so whats coming
Put on captions and try to read it 0:38
That's how we do it in mother russia
It wouldn't surprise me if Roosterteeth bought smosh bc they have been fooling around with Sugar Pine 7
So...what gonna happen?
Wait second that’s it!!!!! What the heck is coming? Someone tell me plz I’m sooo confused
Lmao new merch that’s gonna be disappointment
So no one is going to talk about how they were in a dragon ball z game ad? Shayne looks lit going super sayan
here before Justin Y.
rhett and link bought smosh
If Anthony doesn't come back a whole lot of people going to get piss
Did smosh find a parent company????
They got a new parent company?
smosh will join another company and will find a home
new merch???
What is it the end of the world🌎☄️
The subtitles though....
Shut up intro or anthony
I think they have a parent company :)
Put subtitles on 0:37
We want Anthony
:D
Throw back to when Smosh was good
I CANT WAIT
Anthony plz
Anthony is coming back?
What is coming
This better be you guys doing your part
i bet its something a better video
Friday
asmr anyone
why does ian look like vsauce
Hey, HEY! .. Algo está por venir, viernes, prepárate ... o no, todavía está sucediendo.. o es ... Sí, lo es,

Para los latinos y todo el que habla español..
0:32 “Yes TITS”
Who else read all of the slides in Ian’s voice?
mearc
maybe a new smosh member
my guess: they gonna have merch
Hopefully Anthony is returning
I'm sure it's just a redesign of their website or something.
I think it’s smosh winter games cuz they always do it in February
I dont know but i think i saw shayne from smosh on a episode from Henry danger from nickelodeon
It’s obviously smosh winter games, probably, maybe not, but it’s February
Maybe either Anthony’s coming back or collaborating or they could have gotten their website back
Waste of cardboards.
It’s either Anthony or food fight
Is antony coming back😥😥😥😥😥
Please be anthony
Every entiteled parent ever?
Anthony is coming back?
Anthony is coming back?
Smosh features Anthony as Ash- Greninja strip dancing to Shane and Keth 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know what tomorrow is...
The title says it’s coming I say hats what she said
This is gonna be the longest 2 day wait of my life
First
so excited
The return of Anthony?
this reminds me of Amanda Todd
lol I know whats coming... disappointment
Is Ian not talking because Anthony tells him to "shut up"?
Is it official that Rhett and Link's Mythical Entertainment bought Smosh or was just a rumour?
I think it’s something to do with sugar pine 7. Most of the squad have been in their videos for a while as a “storyline”. But even if it isn’t, i cant wait to see what the news is! ☺️☺️☺️

Edit: i just watched olivias candid 2018 video.(sorry forgot what its titled) and she said that she was going to shoot for a movie in 2019. That might be it i don’t know tho 😂
This is so discriminating against blind people
BRING BACK ANTHONY
food wars is coming back?
If it isn't Anthony coming back or Food Battle.... I don't really care
Channels getting closed? Jk
Is it it Anthony Coming Back?
Is he leaving smosh
It’s the site, they’re probably gonna use it to release videos or maybe they will ask people to sign up for free to get some money from the site
I hope the GMM crew are helping out or.. Anthony
Is it Anthony?
 the second I posted this question the cards said "yes it is" XD
Well I guess it is indeed Anthony coming back
If only it was the old smosh coming back😩
imagine if they get us hyped for new merch 😂🤣😑😑😲
End of the world.
Dear lord, please let this suprise be Anthony coming back to Smosh.
Ian are you Pregnant?
Dogs:bark! Bark!
Cats:meow! Meow!
Idiots:first! First!
New merch?!
It better be Anthony coming back...
what about smosh games?
Smosh's new dad??
YOU NEED TO COLLAB WITH RYAN HIGA AND LIZA KOSHY
Anthony should return with a mask so no-one will recognise him you just need to say it's a new member
DO U STILL TALK TO ANTHONY?????
Pleaseeee be a collab with Anthony!!
I've wanted this since 2017!
Is It Merch?
I helped
is it retirement
They probs got a new parent company. It looked like he was in a brand new studio space.
Please Anthony
ian looks like he should be the creator of an animated series like rick and morty
Anthony? Food Battle?
I hope they are bringing back the What If series they were great
Give up on Smosh!  It's become a has been channel filled with unwanted losers.  Reunite with Anthony instead Ian.

Please be a food battle please be a food battle
My money's on FOOD BATTLE or Anthony

Hmm I wonder if Rhett and link are going to buy smosh

Oh yeah yeah

Hey
Smosh Movie 2
I do not know but i live in another  country (Ireland)  so it might be the time difference or something else but i really hope this works out
secret message in comments
My guess is Smosh Winter Games.
Everyone in the smosh universe lives in the same house
You forgot the type of people who open the door naked
I Want A "Every Every Ever Ever"
1:44 When even the writers ship Shane and Courtney
My boyfriend used to be a delivery boy and I’d always order pizza for delivery whenever he was on his shift and he said it made his work a lot more fun plus he gave me discounts on the pizza every time
so that's how smosh has been getting food without DEFY media
“I got... I got stabbed” 😂😂😂😂This is why Shayne is my favorite.😂😂
3:03  Shayne is just standing there thinking, "You know what, Imma just let him have this..."
And the Oscar goes to..... 3:10
You should do every AirPod users ever 

Edit: thx for all the likes 🙃
U should do every Disneyland trip ever

Every High School drop out be like the dude on 0:52
Every old smosh ever
Brought to you by Uber Eats, We are never on time
sponsored by uber eats
I would like every kfc ever
love how they go to the same house every delivery
lol
Last time I ordered food, 4 people showed up at my door and gave me an entire cake, full of Reece’s pieces
This video was sponsored by Grubhub
“I got stabbed, its a tough job”
3:37 if Ronald McDonald was rl well he will hit me with that dangerous weapon
Smosh isn’t the same without Anthony
3:55 as a delivery driver i can totally confirm this. I always do this
2:37 - I'm probably the only one, but I thought that scene was actually sad. 
I get it was acted but my god, that was pretty deep
Okay, that Bobby part was both hilarous and hauntingly soulcrushing.
I just watched every blank ever on accident but im happy i did
4:44 you should’ve called an uber eats
Hey Dominos, you are my favorite pizza place
NOW DO EVERY DRONE DELIVERY SERVICE!
This feels like old YouTube 😭💕
you should do "EVERY HIDE AND SEEK EVER" i think it would be s funny
I love your show its so funny 😂❤️
If his career flopped then he was the next Ja Rule
THIS WAS MADE ON MY BIRTHDAY!!

"i uber'd here, could you give me a ride home?" HAHAHAHA 😂
A postmates add came on as I was watching this 😂😂😂
Every domzos, game theory, singer, sushi place, Netflix, nerd, horrer com, hope I helped
Ah, I’m just taking a break from James Charles drama and binge watching Smosh now.
No... no one is... gonna say it? No? Ok.  I thought that was my phone at 0:45
It's a crime that they didnt include the person calling you saying "I'm parked outside" instead of coming to the door. My biggest LA delivery problem.
Soon it’ll be robots doing delivery.
That’s my chance to smack the robot and steal the food :)
Ideas for Every blank Ever:

Now the needs to be a “Every Pizza place ever”! And Shayne needs to be in every scene!

Hint: Bohemian Rhapsody
Why do they give me like 40 forks
The add on the video was post mates🤣
Shayne is in the new 'The Goldberg's episode
The last skit definitely has to be the best

Smosh: every everything that doesn’t matter ever!
I legit got a foodpanda ad before this vid
I got a ad about door dash before the video
In my mind, the squad and every addition made is like Ian (and formerly Anthony) fostering them, and then adopting them. I feel like Damien is being fostered right now
How have I only just realised that the old Smosh intro is gone
Soooo related with swiggy and zomato🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I literally got an ad for post mates XD

Every high school reunion ever?            Video idea?
I once ordered from two different restaurants because me and my mother wanted two different things, and the UberEats people showed up at the same time and I answered the door. One of them went "you ordered two things? You're a greedy little pig aren't you?" And I had to get my order refunded.

Oh wow
Help pewdiepie win the battle
really sad to visit the graveyard of this channel. you guys should've gone out gracefully when you had the chance.
Some conclusions I took away with me (made or kept) after watching this flick:  
1. Scorned women are forever vengeful.
2. Always tip for service (even if barely adequate).
3. Basic psychology and counselling skills should be implemented in grade school (as mandatory).
4. Efficiency does  not  produce desirable results.
5. There are only so many "subcontractor" roles possible before the original contracted goal becomes ineffective or irrelevant.
Amen.
How come only Ian, Courtney, Shane, and Damian are in this video.
Hmmmmm idk
Every pet ever
lately my mom has been ordering so much Uber eats it’s crazy lol

Their channel doesn't have an owner anymore which means they don't have funding for new videos which could cause the channel to shut down as the website has aswell as Smosh games so this might be one of the last sketches we will get

Olivia is my favourite , so where is she?
If and when you go back to your old series vids, would you make either Noah, Shayne, or Jovenshire to be that damn neighbor if the original guy won’t? Maybe also give teleporting fat guy a new enemy now that Burt Reynolds has passed away.

the video is beautiful and cool and inspiring ... stop by with a complete package
That is kind of true, I'm like, in my early 20s. I'm 21 and a half years old, like almost 22.
He's a BoxMan 2.3 doesn't feel the same without Anthony.
From TURKEY love youu
You should do a video hanging out with Anthony or something
I thought is was about teens now and teens in the 1920’s 🤣😂😂
Im not a teen im not ready i turn 13 next month WHYYY
Gonna guess, something like:

Teen: can’t wait to grow up and move out!

20s: heyyyy can I move back in? I’m out of money
I literarily turned a teenager when this video was uploaded
I rly miss the smosh intro :/
Your videos are so much more authentic now the separation was a good thing from a video standpoint
i love this video but the bloopers at the end are the funniest part. Ian's brain is an enigma
Im a mix of that lol
the end screen is tea
Dude I used to watch you guys when I was like 12 in 2008 now we’re in 2019 I remembered Smosh and you guys are still here with new content amazing
that's not a home cooked meal, its better, its chipotle

n o p e
I miss Anthony):
100% reality
So it’s angsty vs beyond miserable
......This is why I’ll never move out
how is the new guy?
i dont like him
i want old smosh
come back!!!
Every pro gamer ever do it!!!!
Made my day watching this liked
But guys we all need to subscribed to pewdiepie plz do a video about im plzz
M-M-M-MONEY SHOT
smosh idea:every emo ever
add Anthony in one of them and it’s just him standing there looking at the camera awkwardly then
“this is fxcking stupid” and walks off
This could have been done way better and hit home with more people that actually moved out of their parents house at 18 and bought a house in early 20s. 

Like as teens having all the time in the world, looking forward to the future and as a person in their 20s working a full time job, part time job just to afford the “Stuff” and doing chores around the house, mowing the lawn, fixing things that break down, taking pets to the vet and caring for them, paying taxes on EVERYTHING, property, income (local and federal), gas, sales and schools ( expense ) etc. 

You hit on that a little but I was expecting a really long drawn out bit on the burdens in the 20s lol. 

Or a video on millennials vs teens. People seem to think every kid is a millennial now a days. Even  Stephen Colbert made a skit about millennials won’t ever experience Blockbuster and a bunch of stuff Millennials grew up on lol. Flip phones, Dial Up, Blockbuster, N64, PS1, Nextel Push to Talk, Gameboy on the bus with physical cords draped across the isle battling other kids in Pokémon lol. Things Teens (Post Millennials) won’t experience. We were lucky to get the Gameboy in Color.
You spelled wrong. It's supposed to be "lazy sensitive millenials vs. teens"
Really accurate xD
😂 great video 🏆 truueee 😄
Birds are Government Surveillance Drones!
Mid 20s , your in your prime!!!
Right at the beginning, everything is a lie
finally something different
Karen, get the curtains! Lmao
Quien habla español??

It feels weird to say that I'm in my 20s
Can we all agree smosh needs the like button taken away
Is it weird that Shane looks good with a mustache

DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH RAMEN YOU CAN GET FOR $43!!!!!!!
You can literally see the lower budget
Toxicity to its fullest

This was not accurate at all
Where’s Courtney, Keith and Noah been lately in these type of videos 😢
not relatable to any of your current audience considering they are 12
0:30 Wait, how do you even get hired as a school counselor without a college degree these days? (I honestly thought Smosh was going to make a reference to trade school there as a more efficient/cheaper option.)
“And take out whole audience down a peg!”
My peg was already off the board...you just kinda stomped on it
I'm 21 and dont feel nor see any difference in my life from when i was a teen
Why is Courtney so pale
20's worst years yet .
Who want's Anthony Padilla back?
Make a video every sports store ever
Is chipotle now a home cooked meal?
This is my last day as a teen I'm gonna  be twenty tomorrow 🤩🤩🤗🤗😏
Lool the paycheck one was my favourite
I didn't get the joke at first

I just turned 30!! 😫😭😩
1:48

Love you smosh. Amazing vid thanks for all the happiness and joy u bring to all us fans u mean a lot to all of us and have helped us through many problems. Thanks
The phones part haha!

Hypocrites, Future/Past Jokes, and extreme irony.

Anyone know what brand and model the keyboard is at 2:20 ? Thanks
Are those chipotle plates ???😂
19 and I will turn 20 next year March 2. So basically I’m in the middle of teens and 20’s.
You were one second away from 4:20
1:18 this moment restores my faith in humanity.
We need to find Anthony , who's with me
Give up Smosh—you had a great run—move on;)
The home cooked meal part is verrry accurate
Anthony and Ian who is brother?(i think its anthony because I like he)
Bring Anthony and food battle back!
Paychecks are save points in life
But taxation is theft I'm not just a flithy know it all
i'M dOWn tO cLoWN
This ain't it..
why didn’t they add just one more second onto the vid
I’m watching there old vids cause, who actually listened to their podcast
Im 18, What do i belong toooooo??!!
This is undoubtedly better than the skits I’ve seen from them in years.
Wtf I subscribed and post notifications and it said I didn’t
Wow so that's how she invaded SP7
Bring back food battle
Im here quickly just to mention that this channel shouldve died when it turned into a company with family friendly content. This is nothing near the actual quality of og smosh.

But by the comments i can tell the audience had completely changed since then and new people enjoy this type of comedy. There are definitely no og fans watching this because the comedy type is different and i personally dont enjoy it.
That last one he says home cooked meal but they’re eating chipotle
The things i would give to smell Courtneys Farts for a day
I’m in my early 30s and I can confirm life ends at 30.
The paycheck one hits hard

Everyone shut up about how you miss the old smosh, the old and new are the same but the new wave of smosh is more high budget

Every Final Fantasy Ever
2:31 that laugh is gold
"You can do it....." Grows up:HEY CAN I GET A JOB?(JOB)NOOOO GET OUT
You forgot being a teen and thinking the future is yours but once you reach 20s you are already old
Why are there bunch of orthodox icons in the background at 2:03
Both  Millennials  and  Post Millennials (Teens) in today’s society have proven there the least evolved  the least mature
With a failure to thrive.
Yay hi ian
Where Olivia and Noah?
I'm in my teens, I'm scared for what lies ahead in my 20's
You know, watching this video triggered something within my soul... I remember there was this show that smosh had that was this anime girl in real life or something like that. I kind of want that to get a reboot, but at the same time, I don’t.
I like the tax stuff—but how does this channel have 24 million subscribers. 🤔
Smosh cures my depression, not even a joke I was depressed and I love going to smosh and smosh game to feel better
To smosh: Every time when my step dad and my mom gets mad at each other and scream and get me sad I always watch your videos and it makes me fell good

My blind optimism died when I turned 13 😂😂

They should get Anthony back
If you are a teen and think life is not fair,  it is actually worse and you have not seen the true  reality of life
1:53 YASSS MORE SHORTNEY MOMENTS!!!

I miss you guys
Were's Antony??
Here this is trending on number 20 😂😂😂
Wow. Olivia has changed a lot since the last time I saw her.
Close your eyes and listen 2:51
I thought they killed Smosh
For anyone who is 30+ knows that there is no difference between teens and 20 somethings. 24 is the new 18.
How about every ad ever
Just give up
at least Ian is still here
I miss Anthony wish he was still part of smosh.
I thought Smosh died when Defy stopped...
Keep them MF at an arms length.
I really miss the old smosh
The earliest I have ever been
Smosh has had its hay-day.
Would’ve been better with Anthony in it.
Its nice to know that they ship shortney
Ian's last line my uncle's coming in made me laugh so hard
Please do every cvs ever and if so can you put my name in the you asked for it
I thought its 1920...looks like I'm wrong
You guys should do an every music style ever, since there many types of genres of music
Remember back then when smosh was actually great
I'm neither a teenager or in my 20s, I'm 11...
Where's every blank ever

I wish smosh was still the top 3rd subscribed channel, so sad to see them slightly die out.

Do not move if you might move back.
The bloopers were a lot more entertaining than the actual video. I just came by to see how the smosh channel has been doing. I just hope you giys the best alright? 👍
At least a teacher of mine in high school told my class that half of us probably wouldn't make it in college because we won't be able to afford it for long. Glad I'm in a program but I can see what he means.
Im turning thirteen tomorrow. Im scared
Can u guys make an every cartoon ever vid?

down to clown
I miss
Wow good job smesh
2:29
30 is apparently the new old now, nevermind that its actually the perfect age. I was stupider in my 20 s so enjoy it while it lasts.
Plaese turkish  language  :(
Coudln't relate to the sex one or phone one
SuperGoons is the NEW SMOSH GUYS!!! IT’S LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS!

As a thirteen year old I don’t know how to feel about this
Is smosh still alive? Wow!
Guys you are very cool because you have subscribers in europe and make russian subtitles
I’m straight 20. Times goes by fast
Karen took the kids huh...
smosh is back!
I'm down to clown
I make minimum-wage and each week I still pulling more than $43. A full-time job of 40 hours a week usually nets me around $340-$350
Remember 2012?
both young idiots
This smosh doesnt deserve to be called smosh
3:53
3:49
the old smosh is funnyer (is anthny still in smosh)
transition bad
Who remembers when smosh was actually good, and when the Web page was up  ow it's actually garbage
Is their a funny version?
I think the one I wanna be in teens vs 20  is not teens or 20 but the vs
Hej hej Monika hej pa dig monika
there still able to post videos?
Cringe
1:52 there goes the comments section

SuperGoons is the NEW SMOSH!

You can but pizza with 43 dollars
💀💀
i missed smosh games :( i hope u guys find a mother company soon
Cant believe smosh is back once it becomes homeless
What was the song that was played at teens
Dude their still alive?
I’m a teenager and I wish I was back in middle or elementary and when I’m adult I’m gonna miss elementary and middle school
Love dis
So you guys still homeless ?
Teen Years are BETTER enjoy kids
Truthfully we all act about the same, some just better than others. Age, IQ, life experience, stuff you own, it really all just boils down to what you do with life. I've met teens who own their own car, house, and have better jobs than adults. I've also met adults who act like they're still in highschool and are like 50.
Finally
Ded channel
I miss old smosh
Back in 2000s Teens acts like people in 20s of today while people in the 20s act's like a very matured people while the one's who act's like teens before in 2000s are kids age 12 below.
What if I’m a teenager and realize life is a nightmare we can’t wake up from?
Oh yea the 9020’s
Fake news, no teen has any hope for their future
People still watch this channel?
So wait, who owns the Smosh Brand now?
great bloopers :)
Oh man, college was great, university is a disaster though... welcome to Lakehead... come for the lake, stay for the... wait, I’m not getting any anyways...
JTP JTP JTP!
Use code ceedayy
Do people really still find these funny?
Honestly haven’t watched Smosh since they were number 1 on YouTube and I’m so happy to still laugh at it, uncle part was fucking hilarious
PLEASE bring back "shut up" for gods sake
Hey since they are not on defy media anymore, could anthony come back? It's not the same, and i thought he would.
Teen's: making pokemon lipsync video and the internet loves it.
20: not being popular until your parent company dies and you can make whatever you want again and old fans come flooding back
We only want you when you're seventeen, when your twenty one, you're no fun.
I’m just waiting for a prank interview with Tom Holland don’t mind me
I'm 19 until next month, I think most of the 20s today are stuck in their teen.
I thought this channel was shut down...?
whats the sick beat that plays when teens show on the screen
Do every doctor ever
😎😎😎😎😎😎🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Please bring back Peter Peter
Anthony and Ian need to make videos by themselves again
I hate to be one of those people but I miss the old smosh

Hey can someone help me? I was really trying to find the funny in this video and for some reason I can’t seem to find it.
Smosh rus
¿porque elsmosh ya mo traduce sus vídeos?:(
Smosh is still a thing?
This video really ages the cast. This isn’t what being a teenager is like at all
You're entire audience Damien???? :'( I'm in my 30's and I've watched you almost since Smosh started </3.
I’m a teen and filled with blind pessimism
Anyone else think that old Smosh would've actually taken a bite out of the cushion and screamed at the camera?
idk
What has smosh become?
Nice video
Soon
👍
I miss the old Smosh now their boring and not the same where Anthony padilla

I’m 15 in my sophomore year rn any advice?
Lol
Could y’all please give pewds a shoutout
Smosh ded
Shayne looks like chris evan
“I’m down to clown”
I was at a restaurant for my cousins birthday, and there was a woman on her phone, nearby, the whole time. She was with her family too. At least spend some damn time with your family, Christ.
I thought this Smosh channel was cancelled?
U can tell Shane is holding back a smile in every video .Lol
The check one hit deep
Cringe
Anthony where huhu where are Anthony
3:13 White people problems, Latinos can't relate
Do parents really kick their kids out when they're in their 20's?
Wow
But...taxation IS theft...
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? GET ANTHONY BACK AND FIRE ALL NEW MEMBERS! RESTART SMOSH AND GET IT BACK TOGETHER!!!
Why dont you guys do every Chevy  commercial ever
2019
smosh finally hit 24 million sucribers finally its been years
I want it to be year 6892
It’s funny shayne is in his 20’s
JTP!!!!!!!
Fapping.
What happened to smosh? It sucks now
I love smosh but this isn’t funny to me... teens and 20s is such an easy topic if you do some relatable things, it would’ve been hilarious but couch cushion? And the guidance shit? I usually love Shane’s part the most but...

Like and sub for luck
I only found 2 of them to be the same thing and yet I’m only 19
to fund war
TRUMP 2020
😆😆😆😆😆😆
Funny, i just turned 20 yesterday! Weird to see some of the differences already
Smosh needs to do something to help Pewdiepie defeat T-Series
Smosh isn’t the same without Anthony anymore.
being a teenager sucks lol they're soo defensive about everything and quite frankly, act like whiny baby know it alls when in reality, they don't know anything about the world besides their school and the comfort of their parents home. Just a collection of emotions really.
Hay cabron, como esto parece que ya no se traducira al español y smosh was a great part de mi infancia... i gonna suscribe here uwu
If i laugh even once i will like the video, if i dont ill dislike it
КТО ИЗ РАШКИ?
This sucks, I'm turning 20 this year
I'm 18 now, but still in high school. The amount of differences decreases so much that the only constant differences are that every one in their 20's (except 20 year olds) is old enough for alcohol, and that teens can only move out when they are 18 years or older.
College does things to people
Then 30s and up, you just pretend to get something at your mom's house so she can cook you your favorite meals she would make when you were a kid.
I didn't laugh at all during this video I just don't find it funny like in the old dsys,  I think you should take more time on your videos and infest in trying to make good comedy that will make people laugh
Smosh = Buzzfeed
Dont worry guys i got an idea  the day before you hit 20 just kill yourselfe
Das ist such viel falsch ich habe mein haus kennengelernt und das ist blöd
3:56 look the hell
Movie
siguen vivos alv
You need to help PEWDIEPIE!
Do the mi 9
I turned coke into water, check it out guys
I hate New smosh videos it like watching a documentary of David Niven life and career
Shourtneyyyyy
Mexicans are lucky....
I think if you're in your 30s and up, you still consider 20s to be (mentally) the same as a teenager.
You mean american teenagers...
Pause didn't buzzfeed do the same  video
I’m just 8
Thumbs up if you love Smoshh
“Oh, I’m down to clown!”
Smosh died when they stopped sayin shut up
Subscribe back. Okey
Subscribed to pewdiepie
I hope I don't grow up to be like these baby boomers and make cringy content

Just turned 20 lol, nice timing
0:17 I was thinking he would say male stripper 
I’m weird ok
The first one you really can’t tell if he did drop out or not
Do another show like part timer
This channel still exists...
Do more every blank ever
Don't know if it is different in Europe but as a 20 year old, in the last sketches I related more to the teen's version than to the 20's.
i like how the bloopers were more funny than the actual video
I fk love the new smosh
Didn't you know all teens are pessimists these days
Bring Anthony back
That. Is. A. Nice. Beard
Did she just “true” herself at 2:15?
OMG FINALLY
Что здесь говорят!
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT. TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
hey my sisters 13 and she gets checks for $330
1:06 did I smell a communismo vibe?
Oh yeah yeah - I’m sorry I had to
wheres fortnite
Just noticed Smosh doesn't Pin,Heart or reply
It's sick that ppl born in 2001 are 18 this year, sick. Time moves too fast
Yay suscribed lover your vids + smoshpit
3:56 me this whole video
When bloopers are funnier than the video
thank goodness there are no oh yeah yeahs
Idk why but I kinda feel like Ian is getting more and more cute these days. Like back in the days when Anthony was in smosh, they were both attractive but I used to kinda gravitate towards Anthony but now Ian just stole my heart.
Wht if 20s vs 10s
Ok but the music for teens was sick
YOU CAN DO IT 😠😡
Ian hecox and Anthony ik you ia angry birds voice Ian is bubble and Anthony is hex
Wheres smosh games its been so long
I did it I got in to a tinting job
2.2k
Grandparents vs Great-Grandparents next!
Kids vs 20s
Omg
Does shane sound like morty or what?
No entiendo ni mierda.
Shut your mouth about your taxes, im 18 and where i live i Pay 41% of My earnings to the government as taxes
Who would win?
You can do it
Or 
Just do it
Does anyone else NOT get the notification?!
Hey... where did the low budget smosh go now?
Okay but who else was mad that they didn’t play sweet victory in the halftime show
Defy shuts down, smosh makes hilarious content, when can I throw my money at smosh?
日本人いる？
イアンなめ猫着てるやんw
I'm 24 and my friends too and we still sit like 1:34
Haha. When you want to be an astranort but your too lazy to do the training  (idk how to spell)

Yeah, I should sleep...
Dad ian looks hot
Omg Ian !!

0:55 why does Ian’s hair look like Anthony’s longer hair
shayne is older than courtney
Anyone wanna murder me I just realized my life is pointless
OK BUT THOSE BLOOPERS
So what if I'm in that weird middle stage of being exactly 20?
I learned this stuff when I was 18 lol More like teens vs graduates 😂
this was posted on my birthday
please tell me Damien is gonna be in more of these videos!!
I never wanted to grow up but, it's not all bad, I get to watch more anime.
Smosh was great back then. Ian and anthony were the best.
Where’s Olivia, Keith and Noah?
Video is 1 sec off
I miss Anthony saying SHUT UP
The Goldbergs was on when I was watching this
Lol teens like me have no optimism. We all crave death. It's got to be easier than dealing with the shit we are now.
LONG TIME NO POST
Heya fellow kids 😎🤟
Did u guys find a new home yet?
Y was Shane in the goldbergs
Being a teen is stressful.....
0:00
Where’s the smosh intro
Stop you’re not teenagers anymore stop trying to be
Porfavor regresen smosh en español los extrañamos :(
Old Ian is one cool sly-amf "hand -"" up" go get that turkey!
This is actually true! 😆
First
is smosh still homeless?
Did they get a new parent company??
Somebody ran out of ideas..
Wheres the ads
The paycheck one was too real, I’m offended
IAN!!!!
12 hours ago
3:53 reminds me of the old Ian
Im a teen but feel like a adult
Me at age 17 going into college s t i l l wanting to be an astronomer: crap maybe I really can’t do it
Scooby got waves
Im sorry im gonna sound so stupid but is 20s like adults?
Too real
I love being in my thirties and watching this. I never went to college so I don't have that debt, I just started working and did a good job and moved up, work ethic is worth more than paying to get a piece of paper that says you might be good at something. Don't have kids so every penny I earn goes to me, bills are paid, no debt, and when I have a day off I actually have a day off, many people don't know what that is like. No homework, no chores, just freedom. Stay off social media, avoid advertising, think for yourself, don't be weak and do shit others say you have to do.
im 19 about to turn 20 yeah no but seriously in like less then one month now i have a good paying job i never said the job was good it sucks but better than other factory jobs tho!!!!!!!!!!
I’m a teen I’m scared
Whose house did you shoot this in?  Why are there icons on the wall?
When you're 19 and you oddly relate to both
👌
I deserve 100 likes this is a piece of art
I’ve started it, only 99 to go
welcome back monetisation on smosh.. :p
I'm so dumb when I read the title I thought the video was gonna be teens vs 1920's LOL😂😂😂😂
Speaking of birds, did you know they’re not real?
I was watching The Goldberg's  and I saw shayne I was like ooohhhhh
2:29 That laugh.Hahaha
I have some life advice, always wear a condom😁
20s shayne is legit plini
3:12 that home cooked meal looks a lot like chipotle
I miss the old Smosh
Nothing better than 20s showing how teens are
So teens are some weird variation of spongebob?
2:29 
hahahahahhahaha
I like the video to teens to the 20s nice video 👌🏻
this VS 
is repetitive
Oh no no
mood
Ture x'D
Have you ever been in nikelodeon
Yay


Another Smosh Vid
Epic Gamers Vs Furries
Idk about you but I’m half asleep and that bright ass screen at 0:50 hurts my eyes
I miss anthony
Well, no one told us life was gonna be this way!
Teens rock.
I'm 21 and none of these applies to me. Didn't mess with my notches nice try
As someone like right in between yeah it's all true
Nice you guys put back bloopers we need bts
this is so true, true depression kicks in right on the dot at 20.... 





I wanna die...
Smosh needs to do a podcast
Idk about you but I’m half asleep and that bright ass screen at 0:50 hurts my eyes
some are accurate
yeah olivia is out of smosh
🙃🙃🙃😅
Damian's laugh tho lol
Español favor hablen no entiendo amo sus vídeos pero que sean en español ya
U guys are awsome
I’m in that weird teenage year where I’m fresh out of high school and somewhat considered an adult yet I still live with my mom and sleep with Spider-Man bedsheets
Being a teenager in this generation must really suck. Bullying through youngsters has gotten worst and 13 year olds acting like they're 20 years old...but, there are good parents out there so I assume that most of teens aren't like this buut...just saying 🙄
Pretty soon: 20 vs 21
I liked the one where Shane was tom cruise.
Im a teen, its so true
Don’t smack that couch cushion dinner until you try it.
H e l l o  f e l l o w  k i d s

Smosh should collab with Anthony Padilla
Sounds improvised






I love it
COUCH CUSHION FOR DINNER (AGAIN)

HOLY SHEET!!
But what if I actually like my couch cushions?
No Olivia Keith or Noah?
なめ猫笑笑笑
PLZ bring back the old smosh intro
I don't get this vid tbh
1999 vs 2019
anyone know what type of shirt Courtney is wearing? The Red shirt, thinking it could be fleece but unsure if that's a thing, idk I've seen that shirt style before but can't find it anywhere
well im only 10 soooo
At 3:54 in the video I was eating icecream and I laughed so hard it shot at my nose, and I shouted “ Baby Jesus’s bedsheets!” And got grounded
Do kids versus elders
You can do it I promise
i love this video! they need to make more like it.
It’s like life
I only want 10 likes no more than 10 ok guys .    😔😔😔😔
I feel like shortney tiller is really visible in this video
Nice one!
Life.
So much TRUTH
Smosh your old pal pewdiepie needs your help against t series please do your part and help him
I be flossin
Damien as an evil, emotionless child is one of the best characters.
My wish is that you guys bring back that SHUT UP intro
This is so much funnier knowing Shayne is allergic to peanut butter
Old smosh is slowly returning...
2:59 the face of pure evil
That is one sadistic bearded 8 year-old
If I had a wish I would wish for my dad come back from the grocery store
You can play fortnite with the ninja!

THEORY: Wish-A-Dream is the charitable unit of the Church of Religiotology. For more information, please take a sexiness test.
Omg Damien being a blackmailing, physcotic, deep-voiced,  8-year-old is what I’m living for 😂
Thor: Bring me Than...

Ian has changed his voice and added uber super ultra big beard.
Time is running ultra fast...
Forcefully is what got me.
That 8 year old has a really good 5 o’clock shadow

Low budget stupidity is high quality entertainment

My wish is for Smosh to post a video of Ian doing the floss for 5 minutes straight
Smosh Q so much for being funny and lightning My day when I’m sad it makes me really happy your videos are really funny and always bring me joy and it’s sort of a coping mechanism when I’m down so thanks for making content that’s quality and hilarious
I miss the old style videos of smosh when it was just Ian and Anthony and the other characters are just them in costumes, I remember laughing so hard watching these videos when I was younger
I wish for infinite wishes
I love this video 🤩🙂😀😃😄😁😆
That peanut butter moment was way too long
I would wish for them to get rid of the new cast and have smosh be like it was in 2010 when it was actually good and they had the shut up intro
That is hilarious! Make more stuff like this!
If I had one wish it would be for Anthony to join smash again
Doctor: you have on wish
Trump: I wish for a huge wall
3:01 look at his face
Every bedtime ever
My wish to anthony to come bqck
Finally a good Smosh video
WHAT IS THAT MEME SONG? WHEN EVER YOU LIKE MAKE VIDEOS "IF VIDEO GAMES WERE REAL". AND WHEN ITS LIKE ON A RANDOM GAME TITLE. IT HAS THAT SONG PLAYING. JUST WHAT IS THAT SHORT MEME SONG.

Dear super amazing person reading this, 
    I hope you have a super awesome day! If you don’t think you did, just remember that there's always something to be happy about. It’s the simplest things that can easily make us happy. Be friendly, nice and help each other out. If you are feeling sad or down , remember that there's always hope. Even if all the doors are closed there's still a window. You are awesome, and you are amazing. You are loved and someone cares about you. Be happy, laugh, smile! Suicide is NEVER the answer. Fact is I'm terrified by how easily someone could take their own life. Please stay, there's HOPE! You are smart, beautiful, handsome, wayyyy stronger than you think. Someone loves and cares about you. You're worth it, you're good enough, you're not a failure, you're not a piece of trash. Believe in yourself!!
   I know some people don't like this and will hate, but i just want more people to be happy and to spread more positive energy. I'm not doing this for myself, I just wanna spread the joy to everyone. Maybe I did make some grammar mistakes and spelled something wrong, but I’m just a kid. I’m writing this cause i just wanna make everyone happy:)
My brothers bring in back up
Lol
my wish is to bring back 2006 Smosh
When he said he had Jessie sindrum I cried
That guy on the right looks like elon muskut.
Why does the 8 year old has a beard
Why does the name Jesse sound familiar
lmao
This is too much like key and peeles sketch
Two guys one peanut butter
Torture
Isn't shayne allergic to peanut butter
Ian I don’t mean to be rude but do you keep in touch with Anthony
lol
A true face of satisfaction ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I wish for anthony back.
Smosh is getting a lot better ever since defy media shut down. I say next step is to cancel every blank ever.
Smosh have you ever thought of putting ads or trying to get YouTube to support your channel or sponsor it
Why did I think that the kid was Anthony from old videos
I'll wish for infinite wishes
oh no
I wish for Anthony to return
If I had a wish it would be to go back to 2007.
A guy with pink hat and da rules? 🤔
Man the feels but got it kinda weird.
It’s coming up to February you know what that means smosh  SMOSH WINTER GAMES
Please make EVERY TIKTOK EVER
Iv missed this
Plz fire that guy who is standing in the door
Since Smosh isn't TECHNICALLY a full on BUSINESS anymore... DOES THAT MEAN ANTHONY WILL COME BACK SINCE HE WONT BE HELD BACK BY YOUR COMPANY!!!!!
The blond girl looks like the finesse finisher soccer skin from fortnite
This is the first time in years I ever laughed at a smosh video
Good job at flossing Shane
My wish is that it wasn't Ian and Shane but it was Noah and Keith like when they spat water on each other in the try not to laugh
Like a banna
Heyyyyyyy new smosh actors
deep inhale comedy.
Oh yeah yeah
If I had one wish, I would want to go to Disneyland.
Do a every jock ever
He is Timmy turner if you don't know him he has fairy god parents and he can wish for everything and he has a pink hat
xufcucig
What is ur fan mail address
If I had one wish I would want to meet you guys
Thanks for coming back and watching another Smesh video! Be sure to come back to watch all your favorite smesh cast members: Lan Heflops, Shan Twerp, Gilbert Kwan, Olivia Sui, Fortnite Miller, and Keith Urban Jr!

-Lan
Yeah I also had Mandela effect I thought there was some guy called Anthony in smosh how wierd!?
Anyone notice the Anthony bobble head?
“We’ve always shot in this living room and not a recently closed office”
BE QUIET!!!!
-Smesh 2019
The “be quiet” thing made me remember, what happened to “shut up”?
That "BE QUIET!!" at the end was extremely nostalgic
I think Anthony will be back in this Conspiracy theory
You should’ve changed your channel name to smesh just for this video
GUYS SOMETHINGS DIFFERENT AT THE END







THE COMPANY IS CALLED  AND THE OUTRO IS 
Ian was holding Anthony's bobblehead from like 2013-2014
Can you break into Anthony Padilla’s house?
Edit-and do you even read the comments?
Man, I miss the old Smesh, back when it was just Ian Padilla and Anthony Hecox
WHO ELSE SAW SHAYNE ON THE GOLDBERGS?!
That’s how mafia
works
That "BE QUIET" and the Anthony bobblehead😢😢
I don get the stupid Berenstain bears thing. I always remember it being pronounce “burn-steen”
Super weird. A single Smesh video I haven't seen- Yet- Have notifications on and everything
Hey I just followed you on pewdiepie tuber simulator
How df?!? The be quiet sounded right for a second?!?
Who else checked the channel name after they said smesh
SHANE DAWSON HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
This is some nigahiga level crap
despite that your parent company is gone. your video is so good. love your videos.
Change your name to Smesh I double dare you
This is genuinely funny, I think after Defy shut down everyone has been getting a bit more freedom. Great work guys!
Hahaha Anthony a bubblehead. Hahaha hahaahaaaaaaaa😂😂🤣😂😫😩😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
CERN =Mandela Effect> 
Daniel 7:25

He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.
2:31 OMF ANTHONY'S BOBBLEHEAD
This is classic Smosh! Smesh: Be Quiet hahahaha brilliant guys!
This felt like a classic Smosh episode from years ago. I missed this.
i love how they said the old intro a bit diffrently
Be quiet lol 😂 😂  the video is amazing btw I loved it
I love you guys so much. Your videos are hilarious and keep me going! Thank you so much Smesh for the great content. 🙏 😃
You shouldve talked about the flat earth and round earth
2:26 So is no one going to talk about how Ian was sucking Anthony behind the couch?
0:15 We always pronounced it "Bernsteen" bears. What does that make me, Steven Biko?
I swear new Zealand used to be next to Australia now it is below Australia
Food battle WHERE IS IT DID YOU FORGET PLEASE 2017,2018 THE F#$! PLEASE...........
🤯
I like the old intro
Hey whats up guys Yes (claps while saying yes) today we are going to do another creepy conspiracy video and today we are talking about Mandela effect like people remember it being Smosh but it is actually Smesh and that the names of the people who
made it was Ian and Anthony but it is really Lan and Lanthony ok guys good bye (kisses hand and puts it on camera then turns it off) -Shawne Daswon


p.s i did the Shawne Daswon on purpose
I missed those videos with just win and Anthony especially the bobble head video
I just experienced the Mandela effect


I remember the old intro as “ shut up” but as you have seen at the end it is “be quiet”
Smesh.
e=a(rotate)
Smosh confirmed in SMASH
I love these old style videos 💯 
Edit: That old intro should be used again
I agree with the title.
IT'S JUST MISREMEMBERING/MISPRONOUNCING
ever since Defy closed the videos have been way better.. Keep it up! Feels like the Smesh I originally subscribed to!
MATPAT JOINED THE CHAT
if Anthony back.....ohhhhhh 
The most greater and powerful smosh gona return
For some reason this actually was good
This is a question for Shayne.  Did you play Matthew in the Goldberg's
I do really miss the cast member: Antiny Quesadilla 😂
Eh... Dude im alex or is alekai or wait im confused
I love conspiracy theory’s this is heart breaking and I actually believe the Mandela effect lol
Was Keith in the news for making some girl freak out about now pronouncing Pokémon names
Who else wants 
2009 VS 2019?
Like
I miss smesh's old BE QUIET intro
"Be Quiet!" was funny XD HAHAHAHHA!
Isn't this just being forgetful?
When you run out of ideas.....



ITS A JOKE DON'T ATTACK ME
Sorry! never mind. That was Peter Finch!
Wait... Is Smosh getting better again
plssssssss more try not to laugh callange its been ... idk
Return the intro!!!!!
nobody remembers stevie ;c
What’s next? Smash?

OH WAIT
can we please have 'be quiet' as the new intro lmao
Wait a minute. At the beginning, it said Smosh, but after, it is Smesh.






That means we must've hopped dimensions while watching the video where people thought it was Smesh
Oh hey this video is co- 
SHANE DAWSON ENTERD THE ROOM
If this is the restart of low budget smosh




I'M IN
I half expected to see the channel named changed
I would be thrilled if smosh brings back the shut up intro even if Ian does it!
Hei where is Anthony
There is a therory that the Mandela effect is actually like the butterfly effect
And if time travel will exist, it already does.
wow the old intros is back amazing I remember that intro from the good old days of smesh honestly amazing
I swear on mothers life  that I will like this comment..





 
You swore on your mother's life....
Antony bobblehead!! :c 

We need his return! :c
Ian deepthroating Anthony bobble head was a sign
Every like i will put one 🌳
🌳
U got me with 
“Smesh be quiet 😂 😂 😂 “hahaha
SOOOOOOO MANY INSIDE JOKES I CANT ! HANDS DOWN THE BEST ITERATION OF SMESH!
*Smush*


ZIP IT!!!
The bobble head returned!
Cue dramatic music
>Over 20 million subs
>only 787k views in two freaking weeks
Wait...
Where's the intro?
Only a "Be Quiet"? :'(
Come back FOOD BATTLE 😢😢😢😢
I love how they changed “shut up” intro to “be quiet” outro
You should do an every ASMR ever video that would be amazing
This was so funny! 



Wait I thought Ian did the shut up intro...
FINALLY AN ACTUAL AWESOME VIDEO FROM SMOSH!! 
I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER!!
I know this has nothing to do with this video but I was watching glee and I see DAMEIN and I'm like OMG
The “ BE QUIET!” at the end was everything 😂😂😂😂
Shayne’s scripts are the funniest lol
I really want courtney’s kill me shirt
1:28 when u see a kid wearing light up Spider-Man sketchers...
the smosh joke was hilarious
So glad you guys can still produce good videos on a low budger! Keep going!
BUT HEY THAT’S JUST A THEORY A SMOSH THEORY
when you lose your lighting crew, makeup/hair crew and color correction crew.
Anthony was in this video. 
Did you see him?
2:41
memories man, memories
2:40
That hit HARD
PADILDO IS COMING BACK GUYS! 😂❤
The fact that they acknowledge Anthony and the company closing are amazing lmao
I like how it says Smesh at the end of the vid but it pulls up the end card so the logo is smosh 😂
You guys should do a 1999 vs 2019 later in the year
It's so good to have classic Smesh back. It's like I've been reunited with an old friend who moved away years ago.
HAHAHAHA Literally one of the best videos you’ve done yet! So much love from the Ph!
You guys dont post as much anymore!😔
AN ACTUAL VIDEO AND NOT AN EVERY BLANK EVER???????
I agree with Shayne
While I know it's been rough since Maker shut down, I feel like you guys love the content you're making more. I'm happy to sacrifice studio level editing and budget for more organic, enjoyable and funny content. I'm happy for you guys <3
Ooohhh can u do another 'year' vs 2019 vid
It’d be funny if they changed the Smosh logo to say Smesh to mess with the subscribers heads
“Be quiet” really
But it’s true so you’re dumb 

Ohhh
My teachers name is mr bernstein
Hi smosh ive been watching for 7 years and im 11 i love your vids keep up the good work ive been subbed for 7 years too
HO LEE FUQ, It's been so long since I enjoyed a Smesh video so much.
I researched the Mandela effect and wrote a speech about it a couple of months of go
Laughing through the entire video. gg Smesh well played
Loved the nostalgic sendouts.
YALL BETTER NOT BE DISSIN ON MY SHANE
Nononono the “Smesh” And “be quiet” made me feel so uncomfortable 😭
SMESH?! WHAT!!!!?! * DIES IN MANDELA EFFECT *

This was actually pretty good.
Shayne the entire vid is just me. 👌🏼

The be quiet part was legendary
Rick and Morty reference
Omg Enthony came back :D
We need anatomy pistachio
Anthony bobble-head was a nice touch
Wasn't there a "Bravest Warriors" episode like this?
I miss the old intro 😭😩
the music almost sounds like the music in Riverdale
it would've been funnier if they changed their channel name
can you bring the shut up intro back!!!!
smosh haven't you been at 23M for like 3 years
I’m glad they brought back the old intro for this video lmao
Ok now this is e🅱️ic
Smesh: Smosh 2019 without Anthony lololol

Where's the upload?
Bring back the intro!
OMG HE STILL HAS THE ANTHONY BOBBLE-HEAD!!! 2:29
Donald Trump
Donald Tremp
definitely their best video in a long time, and all it took was becoming homeless
The first time I’ve laughed at a smoosh video in years
might have been the first non-smosh pit video that I've actually found funny in a while. Nice one
Wow, this was really cleverly done.  Way to go.
666k view :)
I thought Anthony was going to show up you know a different dimension where Anthony still there
I loved this skit. Wish they did more stuff like this!
Wasn't it smash all along?
I remember it being smash, but now it's smosh for some reason.
Did you change the name of the channel to smosh for this one joke?
i don't think its dimensions i think (if it is real) it would be time travelers messing with things
I still miss Anthony
Please bring back SHUT UP intro, and I really hope you guys collab with Anthony or even better bring him back to SMESH again!!!
THEY STOLE THIS FROM CAPTAIN DISILLUSION
I miss the “SHUT UP”! Intros....
My new YouTube name is CerlDiadGC
Smosh isnt doing so well
The part when they keep saying wakeeee up made me laugh so hard
2:27 confirmed Ian is gay
This was actually funny. I'm so glad you guys get to have more freedom with your creativity now. I hope to see some really original and clever stuff in the future. :) Hugs and hearts and things.
IT HAS 666k VIEWS🤣🤣🤣
OMG who saw this on AVGN
YOU'RE THE BEST IN THIS WOLRD!!!! SMESH FOREVER!!!!!!!!
2:27 I remember that crazy murdering Anthony puppet thing!!
2:27 Ian licks Anthony's bobble head
I just thought of this! You guys should do 'every viewer ever'!!
Patrick noooooo! :'(
I'd  love to say "All the people who believe this are idiots!"
But please tell me I'm the only one who remembers it Mn'M's and not M&M's
It would be really good if they proceed to edit all the old videos with smesh on it
I JUST SAW SHANE ON THE GOLDBURGS, WHY HAS NO ONE TOLD ME
OMG STEVIE!
MAKE MERCH BECAUSE I WOULD WEAR IT EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE IF YOU MAKE IT
This is actually nice
Imagine if it turned out that they always have been smesh
I've been watching Smosh since 2010 and 2011 and Ian still have a Anthony bobblehead
Who just went to when Amish had emo Anthony and bowl cut Ian
back in my day there was a man called Anthony...
I miss Anthony and Ian
The Kill Me shirt on fleek
Here’s some video ideas
Every Undercover Cop Ever
Every Drug Dealer Ever 
If you use either of these video ideas feel free to put my name in the video.
The difference between universes can be so minute that you could never tell the difference.
This, for some weird reason reminds me of old smosh...I'm diggin' it!
I remember this channel has only two legends
Make video (smosh 2009 VS 2019) please
everytime this channel uploads, my heart sinks further and further. like theyre literally ripping my childhood apart. this isnt smosh.
It's berenstain
Did Anybody Else Skip it Back to See if Any off that stuff was already there??
Go Smesh (Spray paint) "Be Quiet"
WHO REMEMBERS COURTNEY WEARING THIS SHIRT IN THE VIDEO EMO HAIR!!!???

Wait what gives? Did you guys change your channel name when I was watching the video? Could’ve sworn I remembered it as “Smesh”

Bobblehead and Courtney's black T-Shirt though..
2009 vs 2019?

THE OUTRO!!!!!!!!! 😱🙏
I agree with shayne it is an incredibly dumb theory.
Shane Dawson is SHOOKETH
Smosh was so much better before when Anthony was with Ian.
I was a fan from 8 million subs.
Can you make music then vs now
2:13 - 2:14
A squeaky Shayne wake up
There are 100,000s of noticed and recorded differences. As to the explanation, no clue how or why.
Man why didn't I watch this video earlier
this is a great sketch :D feels nice to see them back
Luscious meat bags
Bring back the shut up intro
This is becoming meta

Hah funny cuz a few days ago i was talking about this with my dad

Every Macy’s ever pls
Shane was a perfect choise for this role 🤣
My favorite part was all of Ian's
Keith and Courtney should date
I actually enjoyed this, been a while since i could say that about a smosh video. Keep it up👍
It would have been funny if they changed their profile pic to SMESH>>
I miss anthony ;c
Doesn't it feels odd that people are in 2019 and still comment about the ' X views but (more than X) likes YouTube's drunk and all...'
Who still pronounce it " SMOSH " ?

I miss the old intro&want it back.
The intro should've been like "Why is smesh mentioning the bearstain bears BE QUIET!!!!1!!!111!!1!"
I LOVE THIS
I miss the days when it was just like Anthony and ean
I'm here again
yay a little piece of qnthony
Woah what was Ian doing to the Anthony bobblehead :]

Great video also my name is Gilbert

Stop!
I'm so glad Smesh has always stayed filming in a normal house with a small budget, and was never bought by some big evil parent company. Yep, that's what I remember.
Is that an Anthony Padilla bobble head? A reference to the SHUT UP intro? ANTHONY IS COMING BACK TO SMOSH CONFIRMED.
AT LEAST bring back the intro.
You just riped of the angry video game nerd but it’s cool

The bearnstain theory is old

Is that a foreshadow if Anthony returning?
Content baby 👌👌
I love your viddsssssssssss
I always think that these changes are actual changes that the companies made and they just never said anything cause they thought it didn't matter.
2:27 Anthony toy
Your videos haven’t been funny in years at least two or three years
Even though I don't believe it, the theory is intriguing and interesting, and somewhat scary, as outlandish as it is.
0ne dày I will have 100k sübscrîbers not one person at school believes in me but I will prove everyone wrong  cfuonb
Please bring back food battle
i think its cool how everyone remembers this one thing one way but its actually another but i don't believe it was because SOMETHING HAPPENED TO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE.
The Earth is Flat
The old smosh was soooo much better
What if...



We do "Every Dunkin Donuts ever"?
smish
Please Stop
Smesh>Smosh
there is someone that believe that Mandela Effect is made by Governments
and that they have like a group of people like CIA (but) that go around the World (and Internet) and make Mandela Effects
KEEP WORKING HARD AND GRINDING to all the small youtubers out there.... One day we'll be on top... Dont give up!!!
Im on my way to 3K!!! If you can just like this post, it'll get some attention! God Bless❤️
SHANE DAWSON HAD ENTER THE CHAT

My name is DEAN  but they pronounce it into DI-YAN but i pronounce it into DEAN they will spell it into DIN get it?
In the end though ya did good and keep stretching those creative legs and as much as I would love to see Anthony back... I know that's not gonna happen I feel, so you guys finding your own niche is nice
Hey Article 13 is coming be aware guys your channel might be deleted and will have to make another channel...We will hope for you
Should have changed your YT name to Smesh
When's the next food battle tho? AHAHAHAHAHA sobs
I always thought it was Smosh hum
i think that anyone will even see this, but if only one person reads this it will make my day<33👍🏻👍🏻but to the few people reading this i hope you have a great life and good luck in the future<33👍🏻👍🏻and i know fame doesn’t happen overnight but i’m try my hardest to become a successful youtuber one day🙂 wish me luck guys! ^^,,
I need 6 more susbcribers
Where is anthony
Their running out of ideas...
this has been a trend i've noticed in the past months. smosh videos are steadily decreasing in creativity. i understand this is mainly because they were restricted in certain aspects due to their parent company. I also understand that they may not have the biggest budget anymore due to the parent company shutting down, but i would really like to see smosh go back to the way things were in the glory days of their channel. every video offered something new to enjoy and laugh along with. don't get me wrong, their recent videos are still funny, but there isn't that level of creativity that i enjoyed watching so much. i used to come home after school was anxious to check and see if they had uploaded a video. now i don't feel the same way, because in a way, their recent videos have all really been the same and it becomes almost one big blur. i hate to say it, but their new videos are so similar that it all becomes one big blur called "Every Smosh Video Ever"
why cant u parody TRISHA PAYTAS
What??? It's Smosh not smesh...wait a minute
is smesh a real channel
They should have replaced Ian with Anthony as a joke at one point
This is a clue the Anthony bobble head. There’s a chance Anthony could come back!?
make another every blank ever like every ad ever smesh
Be Quiet
2:27 Is that bubble head Anthony?
I feel bad for people who don't know wtf the mandela effect is n r watchin this like wtf is goin on

Flash back to try not to laugh five where Shane used that as a joke
Shayne is the oposite of Shane Dawson
Alexa play wake up music.
2:31 Ian was totally not holding the Anthony bobblehead from “My Bobblehead is Evil!”
They call it comedy gold carrying a bobble head of Anthony
Why have I not seen Anthony in so long ??
hahaha
Is the Smosh winter games happening this year???????
Stop not you smosh
For some reason this reminds me of old smosh, also Ian is holding one of the evil bobbleheads.
Возьмите меня в смош

It took years just for Shut Up to have its counter part.
Whatever happened to Ian’s mom?
First
I saw anthonys bobblehead!!!!
Oh yeah yeah
Where are Ian and anthony
oh yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah
Funny a video about conspiracy theories and in the comments it’s conspiracy theories about how Anthony is coming back
Why was Ian deep throating a Anthony bobble head?
Isnt this just Shayne normally?
The outro
YOU TOOK SOMEONE'S CHANEL
Smosh does not have that home made video  feel to it anymore
Under rated
still not as stupid as modern smosh
Hi

Ian sucking on anthony's bobblehead reminds me of Food Battle. Old times man

This is the first time watching a smosh video in forever omg I saw the video on the YT Chanel about how you guys had become homeless D; Because your big corporate company that was holding ya hostage abandoned yall It makes me super sad to hear but im very glad you guys are still making the best of it and it could be better to use a normal room in a studio apartment can come up with more OG skits or watever but just glad you guys are still doing you but was broken to see that anthony bobble head but great to see you still showin some love too ! Miss all the OG youtubers D;
Shane your pink signature hat is falling off!
Untill trump turns black or the last Jedi is actually a good movie ill believe in the Mandela effect
This is like Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory, but I remember it being Charlie and the chocolate factory.
Did any one see Anthony toy when Ian was holding it
Anthony's voodoo priest
Fix smosh
Smosh is losing views
Every home ever
just know that the mandela effect is very real and there is a scientific explanation as to how it works while some speculate it as a theory while others say it is complete BS it brings me to one conclusion life is short nobody cares and you shouldn't at the end of the day it is pointless it does not benefit you in anyway to argue with people about it or to argue about anything for that matter its wasted time to do so and before you respond to this comment negatively or troll me or whatever just know that i dont care cause by doing so is a waste of time insulting someone you dont even know. just cause the rest of the world is stupid like that does not mean you have to be 
i was higher than snoop dogg when i wrote this so its highly possible that this whole comment is stupid
im loving new/old smosh
😂😂😂
People who watch too much Shane Dawson. ;)
Get smoosh to 24 million sub
lol
Support Pewdiepie, do your part!!!!!
Wow,smosh really isn’t funny
Gilbert's signature mustache has and always will look good on him
This is why Smesh is the best.
2:41 nostalgia
Be quiet
Amazing video yall
jj mcchoulloughc
Suban al espanol
Oh yeah
ded

TEAA
EVERY COLLEGE EVER
Now smoosh is boring
help pewdiepie
sto es kk
Smosh
Parallel: smesh
oof
Hahaha
Why does Ian always use pink frosted sprinkle donuts? He can’t afford any other food
Went from doing home funny videos to having a make up artist for a YouTube video......
Go smash!!! Go smash that like button
do every tik tok ever
I wish there was a 2019 food battle 😭
You should have changed the name of the channel. You missed that opportunity
Mirror mirror on the wall
Guys, this video felt much more organic and genuinely funny! Idk if the company thing have any influence in how you guys make videos, but if it had you're way better without them
2 clues are pointing to Anhiny’s return and Old Smosh’s return
ALL OF YOU ARE LIZARDS
Anthony BobbleHead Was There!!!
Be Quiet? Oh gods yes
*FACEPALM
go react to anthony's videos
2:25 wtf
Reminds me of the movie Coherent
Yes
Very nice , something new finally
Love it
🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚🤚👐👐👐👐👐
AVGN
Oh wow I’m early and millions of views and likes!!!
😂 I get it. In the Mandela effect, Anthony was a bobble head the whole time. Ian was voicing him and the show was Smesh.
Also Stein is pronounced Es-Tyn
I missed that cardboard sign
love the anthony doll at 2:28
I miss the SHUT UP !!!! intro :(
OK. ok this was reasonably funny?! y'know this was funny!
So Shayne has six letters in his name. Ian makes up one-half of the two founders of Smosh. One-half of six is three...

...Half-Life 3 confirmed, guys! It’s confirmed! 🎉
it would've been gold if they actually changed their name to smesh in every channel and video
BE QUIET!
Thats funny
I could have sworn it was Anthony saying shut up and it was at the beginning of the video


Oh no
I can't find Anthony in smosh anywhere
I remember him being there
What the hell
Barastane bears
mmh this video reminds me of J.J. McCullough video he made 3 months ago
Um no joke no video wouldn't work and Olivia was saying crazy I click on it again and she says scary
LMAO the meta joke got me HAHA
2:41 close enough
Oh shit this was a good one.
was he just deep thraoting that anthony bobblehead?
i love all kinds of conspiracies except for one....i don't like Mandela conspiracy
Smesh
Smesh
ian what are you doing with anthony right there
This is some quality content. Keep 'em coming!
I love Shane SO MUCH! 💕
This is the best sketch in a while 👏🏻 loving the creativity post-parent company shutting down
As someone who supports the existence of Ghosts, Aliens and other supernatural beings, I approve the Mandela Effect!

Sponsored by Jonas Dakrat, that one extra in the credits of that one alien movie you watched fourteen years ago.
Low budget gold!! So much better without Defy
The coffee machine is racist
I just love your videos and i literally dies waiting for a new one.
2:28 best cameo ever and good video
This isnt old smosh, but damn are they looking back at their root.s
Anthony's bobble head was in this video. I wonder if he'll make a return...
I spotted that they said smesh instead of smosh
I remembered shut up but I didn’t know they spoke good English and said be quite it must be mandela effect
Shane Dawson is shaking
Smosh is coming back
the Anthony bobble head killed me lol
Nice AVGN reference
En español
In the thumbnail I thought Shane was pewdiepie
Wadthe heeeel
WTF
First sketch without a parent company and I love it! Finally feels like good old smesh!
they finally came up with a really good comedy sketch that can almost compare to the old days!!!
(sorry if i sound like an asshole, but you guys keep up the good work :-)
that "BE QUIET" tho
An actual good smosh video?? Mayby there is still hope..
I actually didnt get effected by the mandela effect.
Because i actually didnt know who mandela is.
This is so good
What was Ian doing with Anthony’s bubble head?
maybe they've watched JJ McCullough
2:28. Anthony is BAAAAACCKKK!!!
Hey I thought it was smosh. The Mandela effect, of course!
This is better than every blank ever
How cool to see Anthony’s Bubble Head on this video! Seems that “Friendship Always Wins”
Hi
Ok, so in replies, without Googling: what was in the pocket of the jeans on Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA" cover, if you are old enough to remember?
stevie
Shayne ruins everything.
What have they come to smesh
sub to smosh
Is this implying that Anthony is coming back...?
THE ANTHONY BOBBLEHEAD 😭
Anthony come. Back!
I like how Anthony was here
Every Hair Ever

Edit: every Hair color Ever
THAT ANTHONY BOBBLE HEAD BROUGHT BACK SO MANY  MEMORIES
YES THE INTRO CAME BACK SORTA
Wtf I was searching mandela effect yesterday
I love a Show With No Name reference 💕💕💕
nigahiga has entered the chat
They should've renamed their channel name to Smesh temporarily just for this video so it can confuse some people with the Mandela effect
imagine that in another dimension where ian who quit smosh and anthony still at smosh...




nah that would be ridiculous right?
Go smash!
Who remembers when Shane showed up on the fred Nickelodeon show
This is crazy. The same day this video was posted is the same day I personally experienced this "Mandela Effect" thingy. At first, I honestly think this was only a crackpot idea people from the internet popularized, not until I personally experienced it. I was at Science class that day and there was a clear image of a cirrus cloud. We had to look at the image a lot of times because our teacher had given us a task to guess what type of cloud we have that day. After finishing our task, I and my classmates decided to chatter and wait for the bell to ring. While we were chattering, I decided to take a look at my Science textbook once again, when I looked at the pages, the image of the cirrus cloud suddenly had a tree on the middle of the image, at first I thought this was only vandalized by one of my classmates (it actually looks like the tree was drawn using a pen), so I had to look at every single book of my classmates. After doing that, I asked them "Do you guys remember seeing this tree on this photo?" Some said "no" and some said, "I think so". This had confused my classmates and so did it confuse me. Therefore, I asked myself, "Is this a sign the Mandela Effect they were talking about?" What do you guys think this means? I could post it on reddit for more evidence of my experience.
heh an anthony bobble head
Hilarious!
Why do I get a feeling that Anthony might be coming back considering his bobble head was in it as was the catch phrase?
nice vid
HAVE YOU NOTICE THE ANTHONY PADILLA BUBBLE HEAD ON 2:27 ?
Every reptile ever
Lol lol =)
You know what would have made this video perfect, if you manged to get Anthony back for this one video and had him switch for Ian randomly in a jump take. True Smosh Mandela ftw
wait DID IAN JUST ATE ANTHONYS HEA-BE QUIET
No dont show antony bubble face Now i miss him again
This was gold
how cool would it be if they actually changed the channel name to smesh lol
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Steve is back?
This sketch is made even better by the fact that Shayne was the one that broke Courtney and Olivia's brains with the Mandela Effect in the first place
bring back charlie the hamster
Smesh
-BE QUIET
this is canon in the cloverfield universe
We are the champions of the world
Can we please rename Smosh to Smesh

THISNISNSO FUNNY SHFHSAYHSSH THANK U SHEYNE FOR THIS ART
why anthony dissapear?
oh hey wassup anthony !
this feels like a black mirror episode
This isn’t SMOSH
I remember that bobble head.
omg
I thought this video was released a year ago....
The real question is...
Shane "Dawson" Topp
Okk, That's Epic  👏👏
Smosh bros ultimate is the best game ever
If you rename the real chanel to SMESH that would be great, how many people wouldnt recognize. 😀😂
is the bubblehead an easteregg of the return of anthony padilla?? hmmmmmmm??
BE QUIET!
I remember Beer and Steel bears
This would have been a great way to silently change their name for any legal reasons just saying lol
Ryan Higa vibes
Bring back the shut up intro...and Anthony
Who else looked at smesh and checked if they changed there name from smosh to smesh?
Who likes there older videos
Oh no no
Oh no no
Nigahiga?
Plz return Anthony
Soooo good.
Anthony bobble head
The Ryan Todd(Stevie) bit was amazing! Definitely a great vid.
2:28 Ian is holding a Anthony bubble head!
What does it mean? Is Anthony coming back to smesh? 
WHAT IS THIS CONSPIRACY!?!?!!!?
The spraypaint opening was still alive!!
I feel the old smosh writing style is back IMO
"Hey what's up you guys..."
Ooh That's Good
Anthony’s bobble head is back!
The be quiet made me so uncomfortablerrr
2:29 "There's Anthony".
I remember that bobble head long time ago
I guess the video actually trying to say is Anthony is coming back. Woot woot
i have dreamed some very strange things but ian with boobs i can't say that's been one of them, they say dreams mirror your thoughts lol
SHANE
would of been funier if you had changed the actual youtube name
Yay old intr-oh
I'm too high for this
BE QUITE
Smesh!!
The bobble head at 2:37
What happened to the shut up?
The Mandela effect is cool, but I dont agree with these types of people
Level 1 Ian hair level 99 emo hair
The "BE QUIET!" actually made me laugh out loud XD
Thats funny tho, I do remember it being spelled ‘Berenstein’ 😂
Every time I see him it remindes me lf the Goldberg's
How to gaslight your friends 101
if you were legit, you'd have actually changed the channel name to "Smesh" . THAT would have been funny.
Who still remembers the wall of discs they used to have
The thumbnail for this video is what the ladies see when they look up while fiddling  Shane's diddle 😊
Anthony Padilla's return to Smesh confirmed?
I used to pronounce it Bernstein bears lol
This reminds me of the maricraft episode with the shazam movie
I remember when Anthony used to be in smash... this universe is tweakin
LOOOL
SHAYNE? more like SHANE
BE QUIET
they did this in the show with no name HAHAHA
why they get rid of shut up
Oh my gud
New smosh sucks old smosh with Ian and Anthony much better
I’ve always loved the idea of the Mandela effect
i love smesh! good to see emo hair anthony making a cameo in this!
Even funnier would be if the names and photos of all the channels were changed yo represent the Smesh Mandela effect
Yo yall want comedy gold. Bring anthony back. For just one video
I know its a joke but was I the only one who low key checked to see if it was spelled smesh 😂😂
Man, that intro!
No...no no no no NO! The line is "shut up" not "be quiet"
Also, did Olivia turn into the teleporting fat guy?
the eeeeennnnndddd!!! Such strange feels!
2:27 is that Anthony that you are holding?
Anthony's bobblehead 🙂
They should have changed there whole channel name just for this sketch
I LOVE SMESH!
I had a Mandela effect. I swore there used to be a dash in Kit Kat so it was Kit-Kat but apparently there never was one.
@shanedawson
Hey i see the Anthony toy
Why is this video coming out now rather than 2 years ago
damn Ian is old
Shaneeeeeee dawsonnn
First
SMESH IS BACK!! :)
I'm honestly just impressed with how many completely separate sets they got out of Ian's house
And then an egg came to the internet.....
When are they gonna do Every "Every Blank Ever" Ever
4:03 Next Meme clap clap
If u turn on the captions at 4:07 IM CRYING 😂😂
How do you do fellow kids?
Whoever captioned this deserves a medal
When u use Instagram instead of reddit for memes 🤦‍♂️
No it’s the face you make when people say smosh is out of ideas
you guys needa do “EVERY TIK TOK EVERY” i would die ommmggg

edit: someone please like so they can see i would cry
Pewdiepie: no one kills memes like me.




Smosh: hold my beer...
So...wrong..




Memes die when *pewdiepie*...
My meme knowledge is stuck in 2013-2019 kinda. I don't know goat, or mood. Why.

WTF IS WITH COURTNEYS PUPILES
I find it so funny how Ian went from looking like an 8 year old in a 24 year olds body to a middle aged dad. While Anthony still looks the same.
0:41 I'm pretty sure it's called a memelord
Then: Some kid holding sand


Now: THATS HOW MAFIA WORKS

I wanted to write a hate comment but something won't let me. Their hard work.
Let me tell you when the Yanny vs Laurel thing was going down I would always hear my name because my Lorel just spelt differently. Everyone at my school was talking about it and I was like why are you calling me?
1:04 does anyone know what's the name of this meme?
Excuse me what about the life cycle of a meme when someone deep fries it somehow making it 500000x funnier and posting it on reddit.
;-;
i watched a smosh video after 2 years
this video was shot like sugar pine 7's videos
Ian clapped referring to meme review 👏🏻
MEME REVIEW 👏👏
That's how smosh ruins every meme 




Also im a lvl 30 boss
Ian at the first part you look like a teacher that is just trying to find a hidden picture In one of your students drawings and then you just don’t find it so you act like you did
THAT FACE YOU MAKE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS LEBRON ISN’T THE G.O.A.T. 🐐 😂😂😂
0:22 every time that kid in my classroom that does nothing
"They did surgery on a grape"
Ian is really talented at acting, too bad the rest of the content doesn't match his level anymore. Just like with =3 channel, after RWJ signed with some bs company the videos started becaming lame, and I've been a fan since 2007.
Next you should do every Little Caesars Ever
One of the guys in the beginning looks like Gordon Freeman from Half-Life

I wish people would stop saying the new smosh is bad, because if Anthony was never in smosh, these new videos wouldn’t have these comments. But I do agree the old smosh was better. I just think this new smosh is still okay compared to the old smosh.

I hope you guys never lose your fire, you're always full of excitement and passion, and it's the #1 reason I keep coming back. Your "try not to laughs" are all in my fav playlist and I never fail to crack a smile or laugh so hard  when I watch them! I hope you always know your fans have your back.

My favorite sketch for Smosh 2018 is Every YouTuber Ever & my favorite part of it is when Shayne was impersonating Logan Paul when he dropped is Ice Cream & it went on the news & being called out by other youtuber spoofs, that was really cool & my favorite "Smosh Pit" is the Try Not To Laugh video with Joe, my two favorite parts of it is Shayne, spitting out water with the blower & Cortney roasting Joe, Anthony Padilla wanna-be lookin' ass was hardest thing I've ever laughed & I couldn't stop. 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 2019, please be good. - Shayne Topp, on the last day of 2018.
Can you do a video 2009 vs 2019

My favourite video of 2018 is Thank you to the viewers
Can't wait for this year's food battle
You know what my favourite Smosh moment in 2018 was? I discovered you guys this year. I'd been watching Smosh and Smosh Games on and off for a few years, but this was the year I realised exactly what it is you do and how much amazing stuff I'd been missing. I got to know all of you, in both Smosh and Smosh Games; I watched so many old videos, picked favourites amongst your series, and found so many things to be excited for in my upcoming weeks. I really learned to love all of you - and then I thought you'd gone, just as you'd become an integral part of my life, and I was genuinely devastated that I'd spent such a short time as a Smosh viewer compared to the fans who'd been around for years. But when you made it clear that you weren't going to go down with Defy Media, and you were going to keep functioning just as you always had and find a new place to create your content, it gave me so much respect for all of you - paired with all the other good things I could say about you guys after sticking around for just one year. I can't wait to see how Smosh rises out of the ashes, and I'm so glad I'm being brought along for the ride. Happy 2019, everyone, and I wish you all the very best <3
You are the best ! 😄
1:21 at that point Ian missed Anthony
Courtneys hair is so beautiful
I love Ians beard but Noahs beard looks a bit like pubic hair
No will you all excuse me I will be waiting for the best of 2019 Smosh highlights video next.
Working on my Social anxiety
I can see that all of your comedic styles are mixing, and THATS my favorite pizza place.
It’s weird seeing them normal..😂
Soooooo Noah is tryna be Wolverine with that beard? Okay
nothing was good about 2018
Best part of 2018 was meeting Smosh games. Wish I coulda meet you gaiz too, but alas...sooner rather then later!!!
I liked Olivia being the bully to Shayne (I also liked the 2018 song but I don't remember if that came out at the end of 2017 or not) the thank you for the views song

food battle 2019?
Smosh, you're my favourite pizza place.

Thank you for being strong, and producing videos even when you had the roughest times. All of the Smosh things are my favourites, but I really liked the Try Not To Laughs and the Fight Phone Calls Between Shayne And Olivia. Let's hope 2019 will be the best year ever, but I really doubt that.

Yet again, thank you. Thank you to: Shayne, Noah, Courtney, Olivia and of course, Keith.
Life's a party, you're a boy.
My favorite sketches were definitely the ones with Olivia as the Lil Tay-esque character
Anthony has to come back......cause yall separate your content is all right...but u guys together your videos are Extraordinary

I like the out smosh not this smosh not entertaining content or the old intro
They look so different lan and Anthony if he is still there
The beginning. Pentatonix white winter hymnal who??
More like WORST of smosh 2018
Y'all should have done a quick review of all of Noah's hair choices from the year. Missed opportunity.
I cant wait for what you guys do in 2019
All the try not to laugh videos are forever iconic. cant wait to see more!
Ian looks like their dad
Im on winter break I ain’t doing no homework, but in case this counts for a grade I loved the YouTube Detention and Anime vids, and from the Smosh Pit basically anything especially TNTL. Bonus points for SG, Smosh and Order and Maricraft

Another food battle with  someone else or with anthony
I've been watching since 2010... I've memorized the dixon cider song😂
My fav videos are definitely no doubt all of the try not to laugh ones on smosh pit and the every blank ever I love you all so much and without smosh I would’ve prob laughed a lot less this year thank you so much for a great year
Is this the end chif?
I think Smosh should collab with Anthony. I'm not saying that Anthony has to return, I'm just saying they should do a video together.
Smosh, ur my favorite pizza place
Smosh is....a mess in 2018...........i still miss anthony :(
I hope that in 2019 people will come to the realization that Smosh is one of those channels that you come across while looking up other things and say: "Oh wow they still make videos."
I know it's an oot comment, but that paintings in the background is pleasant.
It still feels weird without food battle...

Does anyone else think that Smosh should do another fan get together and one of the prizes you can win is a slow dance with Shayne, to Beauty and the Beast? (obviously other things like that too, thats just the one I want lol)

Smosh's content has officially sunk down to Disney level. Sorry guys. You had your run
2019 anyone?
Who is hyped for 2019?
Cut your beard Ian
I’m really surprised no one mentioned High School Fight Caught on Camera. The writing and Shayne and Damien’s acting were amazing! Shayne did such a good job on it. Def my fav smosh sketch of 2018
Old smosh is better than now i miss anthony and ian they saying dumb @ss
Does smosh is still relevant?
ElSmosh TT
Where is everyone else
Every YouTube rewind ever
MORE TRY NOT LAUGH! SHAYNE IS SOO FUNNY!
There all wearing glasses expect for Shane
My Favorite Videos of 2018:
Smosh- You Posted That with Ned Fulmer, Khadi Don, & Shayne Topp. Cortney was a better announcer than Shayne (sorry). I also love Guy Flawless, & Every Airplane Ever.
Smosh Pit-  I liked the day jobs series, specifically the life guards one. 
Smosh Games- I love the one with the Try Guys.
I did really enjoy all the videos this year. Thank you guys for being the highlight of my year since I only started watching early this year. I truly love all of the fam and I wish you only the best. HAPPY NEW YEAR!
How Noah got beard
Hi, I'm Brazilian, people
Every kid on the internet ever
Bring Anthony back plz bring him back do more like food wars with him plz plz plz PLZ
Shayne didn’t get half the credit he deserves. I don’t care if he’s an aryan race white male with hella muscles he’s by far the funniest and nobody recognized him and that pisses me off.
Shut up!!!! Bring it back please!
Noah needs to shave because right now he looks like wolverine if he takes off the glasses.
i remeber smosh 7 years ago
Came here after 2 years, where is the other guy, was Anthony his name? And who is this people?
I love Ian’s beard
We require food battles to returb
